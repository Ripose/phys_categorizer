Abstract. Electron-impact ionization of lithium is studied using the convergent
close-coupling (CCC) method at 25.4 and 54.4 eV. Particular attention is paid to
the spin-dependence of the ionization cross sections. Convergence is found to be more
rapid for the spin asymmetries, which are in good agreement with experiment, than
for the underlying cross sections. Comparison with the recent measured and DS3C-
calculated data of Streun et al (1999) is most intriguing. Excellent agreement is found
with the measured and calculated spin asymmetries, yet the discrepancy between the
CCC and DS3C cross sections is very large.

1. Introduction

2

One of the great strengths of the ﬁeld of electron-atom scattering is the strong interplay
between theory and experiment. Generally, experiment is used to test theory and so
leads the way forward. The ultimate goal of a measurement of a particular scattering
process is to perform a so-called complete experiment, one that fully determines all
possible aspects of the collision (Bederson 1969a, Bederson 1969b). Such measurements
are able to fully test the scattering amplitudes arising in any theory.
In practice
this goal has been rarely achieved with electron-impact excitation of the nP states
of helium being a notable example (see (Fursa & Bray 1995) and references therein).
However, this scattering process is not particularly rich in information requiring the
measurement, at each scattering angle, of only the diﬀerential cross section and the three
Stokes paramaters to fully test the two independent theoretical (complex) scattering
amplitudes. One way to increase the scattering process information is to scatter electrons
from a non-spin-zero atomic target. This immediately doubles the number of scattering
amplitudes, and allows for a thorough test of the theoretical treatment of electron-
exchange processes. It was electron scattering on the H and Na targets which showed the
accuracy of the convergent close-coupling (CCC) approach to electron-atom scattering
(Bray & Stelbovics 1993, Bray 1994c).

Another way to increase the amount of information associated with a scattering
process is to consider excitation of more complicated ﬁnal states, or at energies above
the ionization threshold, to measure the fully resolved diﬀerential ionization (e,2e) cross
sections. Though initially the close-coupling approach has been applied to elastic
and discrete excitation processes, it has been clear for some time that intermediate
excitation to the continuum must be treated in order to ensure accurate ﬁnal results.
The CCC method has proved particularly successful in this regard and showed that
e-Na spin-resolved 3P excitation description required detailed coupling within the
continuum (Bray 1994b). This unexpected result encouraged us to look directly at
ionization processes.

The CCC application to electron-impact ionization of helium has been particularly
successful for asymmetric (Bray & Fursa 1996, R¨oder et al 1996a, R¨oder et al 1996b) and
equal-energy sharing (Bray et al 1997, Bray et al 1998, Rioual et al 1998) kinematics.
Some problems with absolute values were identiﬁed (R¨oder et al 1997) and explained
by reference to the mechanics of the close-coupling method (Bray 1997). While the
total ionization cross section (TICS) is very stable at all energies as a function of the
number of states N used to expand the total wave function, the underlying singly
diﬀerential ionization cross section (SDCS) may not be. The TICS is stable due to
the unitarity of the formalism, which does not allow for any double-counting of the
ionization cross sections even though these are obtained from excitation of pseudostates
of positive energy 0 < ǫ(N )
n < E where E is the total (excess) energy. We believe the
instability in the SDCS is due to convergence to zero of excitation amplitudes of states
with E/2 < ǫ(N )
n < E. This leads to a step-function SDCS. Though this explanation

(e,2e) on lithium

3

has been met with some hostility (Bencze & Chandler 1999), who claim that the CCC-
calculated SDCS should instead be symmetric about E/2 (at odds with unitarity!) we
are still conﬁdent that our interpretation is correct (Bray 1999b), subject to modiﬁcation
due to the work of Stelbovics (1999). Whereas we supposed that the CCC amplitudes
at the step would converge extremely slowly in magnitude to the full size of the step, he
showed, in eﬀect, that the CCC amplitudes have converged, but to half the step size. His
analysis reconciles the coherent versus incoherent combintion of the amplitudes at E/2,
see discussion by Bray (1999a). Furthermore, other approaches have shown consistency
and accuracy of the CCC method (Miyashita et al 1999, Baertschy et al 1999).

What we ﬁnd more disturbing is that a systematic application of the CCC method
to e-H ionization has shown inconsistent agreement with experiment (Bray 1999a). In
the energy region between 17.6 and 30 eV there is at times substantial disagreement with
experiment, not found in the e-He case. The e-H and e-He ionization problems diﬀer in
that the former needs to be solved for two total spins. This may cause the CCC method
more diﬃculty in treating targets like H as opposed to He. Having spin-resolved fully
diﬀerential e-H ionization measurements would be particularly helpful. Unfortunately,
this has not yet occured, but there has been substantial progress in measuring closely
related e-Li ionization processes (Baum et al 1992, Streun et al 1998, Streun et al 1999).
The aim of this paper is to examine the implications of the analysis of Stelbovics
(1999) on spin-resolved cross sections in the case of e-Li ionization.
In addition,
to compare the CCC method with the recent measurements and calculations of e-Li
ionization at 25.4 eV by Streun et al (1999).

2. Theory

The details of the CCC theory for ionization of atoms by electron impact have been
given by Bray & Fursa (1996). This was suitable for hydrogen and helium targets
with extension to lithium being trivial using the details given by Bray (1994c). Brieﬂy,
the structure of the lithium atom is obtained by diagonalising the target frozen-core
Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian H2 using an orthogonal (one-electron) Laguerre basis. This
is possible after the core 1s wave functions have been evaluated using the self-consistent
ﬁeld Hartree-Fock equations. Upon diagonalisation n = 1, . . . , N square-integrable
target states φ(N )
are obtained. The negative-energy states describe
the discrete spectrum, while the positive-energy states provide a discretization of the
target continuum. For a given incident electron energy k2
i /2 the close-coupling equations
are solved for the T matrix separately for each total spin S to deﬁne the scattering
amplitudes for excitation of states φ(N )

Thus, the problem looks as if only discrete excitation has been treated. We associate
ionization with excitation of the positive-energy states. Assuming that the asymptotic
Hamiltonian may be partioned asymmetrically as K1 + H2, where K1 is the projectile-
space kinetic energy operator, leads to the deﬁnition of the (e,2e) amplitude

The fundamental problem with the application of the close-coupling approach to
ionization is that allowance for excitation of states with 0 < ǫ(N )
f < E, equivalent to
integration over the continuum from 0 to E, suggests double-counting of ionization
processes. Yet being a unitary theory, which yields accurate total ionization cross
sections (TICS) (Bray & Stelbovics 1993), is a contradiction to this. The step-function
idea (Bray 1997), suggested upon numerical investigation, says that with increasing N
the amplitudes for excitation of states with E/2 < ǫ(N )
f < E will converge to zero, with
the resulting secondary energy integration being from 0 to E/2 as in formal theory of
ionization. The question remains as to how to deﬁne the cross sections for ﬁnite N. The
incoherent combination of amplitudes on either side of E/2 was suggested by Bray &
Fursa (1996) as a way of preserving unitarity

This combination had nothing to do with Pauli symmetrization, only to preserve the
accuracy of the TICS for the energy integration ending at E/2. The individual fS are
already a coherent combination of their direct and exchange amplitudes. Typically, the
term with qf < kf is by far the most dominant. At E/2 the two terms are quite similar.
It is a numerical

“double-counting” term which should be near zero for qf < kf .

While (3) yielded excellent angular distributions the magnitude of the E/2
cross sections was typically around a factor of two too low (Bray et al 1997, Bray
et al 1998, Rioual et al 1998). We put this down to extremely slow convergence of
amplitudes to the top of the step size.

Stelbovics (1999) analysed the close-coupling approach to ionization in a model e-H

problem and concluded that at E/2 the cross section should be deﬁned as

and that the CCC amplitudes at E/2 had converged but to half the step size, as if
solving the CCC equationions is like performing Fourier expansions of step functions.
Hence (3) should have been multiplied by exactly two, but only for the case of equal
energy-sharing, and hence not aﬀecting the accuracy to which unitarity is satisﬁed. For
asymmetric energy sharing Stelbovics (1999) showed that only if the CCC amplitudes
were identically zero in the energy range E/2 < ǫ(N )
f < E could the ionization amplitudes
be unambiguously deﬁned. In which case they are just the CCC amplitudes in the energy

f ≤ E/2. For practical purposes he suggested that the error with using

At ﬁrst glance one might expect substantial diﬀerence between (4) and (3). For
substantially asymmetric energy sharing qf < kf only the ﬁrst term contributes
signiﬁcantly, and so both prescriptions give a similar result. At E/2 we need to multiply
(3) by two before comparison with (4). A detailed numerical comparison has been given
by Bray (1999a) and found the two forms to be barely distinguishable. The reason for
this is that if qf = kf then

is a relatively small number in practical calculations, which should converge
to zero with increasing N. The diﬀerence between 2×(3) and (4) is |δ(N )
S |2. This
reconciles the two approaches and yields similar results in realistic e-H calculations
(Bray 1999a). We should mention that the problem with lack of convergence in the
magnitudes of the CCC amplitudes at asymmetric energy-sharing remains and we resort
to a semi-empirical rescaling of these amplitudes utilising the known values at E/2
(Bray 1999a).

3. Results

Before looking at the detailed results for the two incident electron energies considered
we present, in ﬁgure 1, the total ionization cross sections and their spin asymmetries.
These are compared with previous, much smaller, CCC calculations and experiment.
Good agreement is found of the present calculations with the old for both parameters.
Agreement with the spin asymmetry measurements is satisfactory given the stated
systematic uncertainty (Baum et al 1985). Convergence for the cross section is very
good, and thus the systematic discrepancy with the measurements of Zapesochnyi &
Aleksakhin (1969) persists.

3.1. Electron-lithium ionization at 54.4 eV

Experimental data for e-Li ionization is available for 54.4 eV incident energy (E =
49 eV), with secondary electrons having energy (eV) sharing as (EB, EA) pairs of (5,44),
(14,35) and (24.5,24.5) (Streun et al 1998). A CCC(69) calculation has already been
presented for these cases by Streun et al (1998). Here we also give a CCC(97) calculation
which has maximum target-space orbital angular momentum lmax = 6 with around 18-l
states for each l. The 69-state calculation has lmax = 5 with around 15-l states for
each l. The 97-state calculation requires approximately 1.5 G of RAM. In addition to
checking convergence in both the spin asymmetries and diﬀerential cross sections, for
the (24.5,24.5) case we also consider the generation of these using both the combinations
(3) multiplied by two and (4).

In ﬁgure 2 we compare the SDCS arising in the 69- and 97-state calculations. We
see that both the singlet and triplet components are rather smooth and fall-oﬀ to zero

uniformly. In experiment the SDCS would be measured to be symmetric about 24.5 eV,
and the present results should not be viewed as a contradiction to this, as Bencze &
Chandler (1999) have. What is plotted is the square of the magnitude of the amplitude
(2) integrated over the angles of the outgoing electrons. If we were to use the form (3)
or (4) an almost identical symmetric SDCS would result, with the diﬀerence that (4)
would yield a cross section two times bigger at the secondary energy of 24.5 eV. The
plotted SDCS yield TICS upon secondary energy integration from 0 to E, whereas the
symmetric forms would have E/2 as the endpoint of integration. It is the smallness of
the cross section at 24.5 eV that, in our view, allows the CCC method to yield relatively
accurate SDCS at the smaller secondary energies. In other words, the step-function is
relatively easy to satisfy for the 54.4 eV incident energy, and all of the possible physical
processes are treated by the pseudostates with ǫ(N )

f ≤ E/2.

where r is the ratio of the triplet to singlet (no spin weights) TDCS. These are given for
the secondary energy of EB = 5 eV in ﬁgure 3 in the geometry where the fast (44 eV)
electron is detected at θA = 35◦. We use the notation, convenient in the coplanar
geometry, that negative angles are on the opposite side of the incident beam (z-axis) to
the positive angles. We see that there is some diﬀerence between the two calculations
with the asymmetry varying most when the cross section is small. This is an example
of the general statement that the smaller the cross section the bigger the calculation
necessary to obtain such cross sections accurately. Further, even larger calculations,
which grow very rapidly with increasing lmax, would be necessary to determine the cross
sections more accurately. Nevertheless agreement with experiment is satisfactory for
both the spin asymmetries, and is superior to the distorted wave Born approximation
(DWBA) reported by Streun et al (1998).

Figure 4 reports results for the EB = 14 eV case. Somewhat better convergence
is found for this case for both the spin asymmetries and the TDCS. Agreement with
experiment is good and is of the same quality to that of the DWBA calculation reported
by Streun et al (1998).

The equal-energy sharing case EB = EA = 24.5 eV presented in ﬁgure 5 is more
interesting. For the two previous cases combinations (3) and (4) yield near identical
results due to the second “double-counting” term being negligible, see ﬁgure 2 for
energies greater than 24.5 eV. However, at equal energy-sharing both terms come

into play as they are derived from the same amplitudes (2). Due to the suggestion
of Stelbovics (1999) that at E/2 the CCC amplitudes converge to half the step size,
the results of (3) need to be multiplied by two before comparison with (4), which only
aﬀects the TDCS, not the spin asymmetries.

Let us examine the TDCS ﬁrst. Around the maximum of the TDCS both forms
give much the same result, which diﬀer substntially for the two calculations. The
diﬀerence between the CCC(69) and CCC(97) curves is not surprising, and is primarily
due to the increase by one of lmax in the latter calculation. Given that the outgoing
electron energies are 24.5 eV one would expect to require even substantially larger
than lmax = 6. However, the unitarity of the close-coupling formalism severely restricts
ﬂux to large angular momentum channels as this is related to convergence in just the
elastic scattering channel (Bray 1994a). The agreement between the two combinations
of amplitudes for the larger TDCS indicates that δ(N )
in (5) is relatively small at those
angles. Thus, we see that while satisfying (5) is a good thing, the diﬀerence between
the CCC(97) and CCC(69) TDCS indicates that it is not suﬃcient to assure accuracy

of the results. Clearly calculations with even larger lmax are necessary to obtain a more
accurate estimate of the TDCS.

Turning our attention to the spin asymmetries, we see that the form (4) yields
identically unity for the θA = −θB = 45◦ case. This is expected from the Pauli Principle
with the triplet TDCS vanishing identically in (4) and almost so in (3) due to (5).
What is particularly interesting is that (4) yield much closer results for the two CCC
calculations than does (3). Most encouraging is the removal, by the use of (4) instead of
(3), of the oscillation around θB = −70◦, not seen in experiment or the DWBA theory
(Streun et al 1998). This means that the combination (4) is more eﬃcient at hiding a
lack of convergence in the underlying CCC amplitudes by the construction of the exactly
required symmetry in the amplitudes used to generate the TDCS.

3.2. Electron-lithium ionization at 25.4 eV

The recent measurements of Streun et al (1999) at 25.4 eV incident energy (E = 20 eV)
take a diﬀerent form to those above. The coplanar symmetric θA = −θB = 45◦ single
point is taken, and the asymmetry measured at this point as a function of the energy-
sharing of the two electrons. Given the diﬃculty the CCC theory has in obtaining
convergent SDCS at low energies, such measurements are particularly challenging.

We present the results of just a single CCC calculation, which has been checked for
convergence. It couples a total of 107 states, where lmax = 7 and has around 18-l states
for each l. The Laguerre exponential fall-oﬀs λl ≈ 2 were varied slightly to ensure a
pseudostate of 10 eV for each l resulting with a total of around ten other positive-energy
states. The amplitudes for arbitrary EB are obtained by interpolation.

Firstly, in ﬁgure 6, the SDCS are given. We see that the individual CCC(107)
singlet and triplet SDCS have unphysical oscillations. These are due to, we suspect,

the SDCS(E/2) being substantial. Also given are the quadratic integral preserving
labeled as CCC(∞), whose SDCS(E/2) are four times the CCC(107)
estimates,
SDCS(E/2). The label ∞ is used to suggest the result of a fully convergent close-
coupling calculation. Note that at E/2 the convergence of CCC(∞) is to CCC(107)
SDCS(E/2), that is a quarter of the step size owing to convergence of CCC(107)
amplitudes to half the true amplitude at E/2. There is quite substantial diﬀerence
between the CCC(∞) and CCC(107) curves, not only around E/2 but also at small
secondary energies. While we do not know how accurate the CCC(∞) estimates are we
believe them to be more accurate than the CCC(107) raw results and would use them
to rescale the magnitudes of any TDCS calculated for EB < E/2.

Figure 7 gives the spin asymmetries and TDCS corresponding to the experiment
and calculations of Streun et al (1999). Turning our attention to the spin asymmetries
we see very good agreement between the CCC(107) calculation, using (3) and (4), the
DS3C calculation, and the experiment. The agreement between the use of (4) and DS3C
is a little better than the use of (3). This is particularly evident around E/2 where both
yield exactly unity, as would be expected. The discrepancy with experiment in this case
is due to experimental uncertainties. One may ask what eﬀect would rescaling the CCC
calculations according to the CCC(∞) estimates given in ﬁgure 6. For the EB = 2 eV no
change would result as here the estimates and the raw results intersect. At EB = 4 eV
the estimates suggest a small increase in the triplet component and a small decrease in
the singlet component. This would result in a decrease in the asymmetry (see (7)), and
hence the DS3C calcuation is perhaps more accurate here, even though the relevant CCC
result goes through the midpoint of the error bar. At EB = 6 eV the estimates predict
a drop in the triplet cross section and therefore a further small rise in the asymmetry.

Figure 7. The coplanar θA = −θB = 45◦ triply diﬀerential cross section and
spin asymmetry for 25.4 eV electron-impact ionization of the ground state of lithium
calculated using the 107-state CCC calculation for both Eqs.(3) and (4). Also given
are the DS3C results of Streun et al (1999).

Lastly, for EB = 8 eV both the singlet and triplet cross sections estimates are twice the
raw results, unaﬀecting the asymmetry.

The good agreement between the theories for the spin asymmetry is lost when the
corresponding TDCS is considered. The factor of two diﬀerence at E/2 between the
CCC(107) results evaluated using (3) and (4) is expected. Thus there is no way for
(3) to yield accurate SDCS in the vicinity of E/2. The question is how accurate is the
coherent combination (4)? While we are conﬁdent of the accuracy of the magnitude
yielded by (4) at E/2, which is considerably lower than that predicted by the DS3C
theory, the cusp here looks somewhat unphysical. Given that detailed convergence
studies in a model problem show an ever increasing slope of the CCC-calculated SDCS
at E/2 (Bray 1997), even the new form (4) may be unable to achieve accuracy in the
SDCS in a neighbourhood of E/2, even while having convergent SDCS at E/2.

Another interesting feature that arises from the consideration of the TDCS is the
visible diﬀerence between the usage of (3) and (4) for the asymmetric energy sharing
below 5 eV. This is surprising given the SDCS presented in ﬁgure 6. The reason for

(e,2e) on lithium

the diﬀerence is simple. If we write the ratio of the presented SDCS(15)/SDCS(5)= r2,
then the ratio of the corresponding amplitudes is just r. Since the combination (3)
sums cross sections, the contributions past E/2 only signiﬁcantly contribute to the
presented TDCS in the energy region 5 to 15 eV. However, the combination (4) has
CCC amplitudes calculated at energies greater than E/2 contributing visibly to the
presented TDCS over a much wider energy range.

Unfortunately, the diﬀerence between the two CCC-calculated TDCS is somewhat
academic since the underlying amplitudes have only converged to an acceptable accuracy
at the E/2 point. The diﬀerence between the estimated and calculated SDCS in ﬁgure 6
is indicative of the lack of convergence (except at the E/2 point). Hence rescaling the
CCC-calculated TDCS utilising the SDCS estimates would probably result in TDCS
more accurate than those presented.

4. Conclusions

Spin-resolved electron-litium ionization TDCS have been considered for the 54.4 and
25.4 eV incident energies. For both cases asymmetric through to symmetric energy-
sharing kinematics were considered. At the higher energy reasonable convergence in
the underlying CCC amplitudes has been achieved and good agreement with available
spin-asymmetry experiment obtained in all cases. For the equal energy-case the
combination of amplitudes suggested by Stelbovics (1999), see (4), yields more accurate
spin asymmetries. This indicates that obtaining convergent underlying CCC amplitudes
of correct symmetry is more diﬃcult in the case of lithium than for atomic hydrogen
(Bray 1999a). The explicit imposition of the required symmetry via (4) allows for a
faster rate of convergence in observable phenomena.

At the lower energy the SDCS at E/2 is relatively more substantial than at the
higher energy and therefore the convergence in the CCC ionization amplitudes has
not been achieved generally. Numerically, it is too diﬃcult to adequately reproduce
a step-function in the underlying CCC amplitudes. Nevertheless, convergence of the
E/2 amplitudes to half the true ones has been achieved to a reasonable accuracy. The
agreement with the measured and the DS3C-calculated spin asymmetries presented by
Streun et al (1999) is very good. Thus the spin asymmetry experiment is unable to
establish the relative accuracy of the CCC and DS3C theories. However, the DS3C and
CCC TDCS are very diﬀerent, particularly at the equal energy-sharing point where the
CCC result is fully ab initio. Accordingly, absolute determination of the ionization cross
sections, preferably as a function of secondary energy would be very welcome.

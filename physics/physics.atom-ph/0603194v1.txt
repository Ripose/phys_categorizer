We report the experimental observation of alignment to orientation conversion in the 7D3/2 and
9D3/2 states of Cs in the presence of an external dc electric ﬁeld, and without the inﬂuence of
magnetic ﬁelds or atomic collisions. Initial alignment of angular momentum states was created by
two-step excitation with linearly polarized laser radiation. The appearance of transverse orientation
of angular momentum was conﬁrmed by the observation of circularly polarized light. We present
experimentally measured signals and compare them with the results of a detailed theoretical model
based on the optical Bloch equations.

Atomic physics experiments are able to place sensitive
limits on the permanent electric dipole moment (EDM)
of the electron because highly polarizable atoms can gen-
erate internal electric ﬁelds that are orders of magni-
tude higher than can be achieved for free particles [1, 2].
Such limits on the electron EDM are of great interest
to fundamental physics because a permanent EDM of
a fundamental particle implies CP violation as long as
the CPT theorem is assumed to hold. Such a CP vio-
lation would be a signature of new physics beyond the
standard model [3]. The most sensitive upper limit to
date on the electron EDM has been achieved by search-
ing for a small precession around an external electric ﬁeld
of the angular momentum distribution of an ensemble of
atoms [4]. Various sophisticated experimental techniques
prevent angular momentum precession caused by mecha-
nisms other than an EDM from contaminating the signal.
One such phenomenon, known as alignment to orienta-
tion conversion (AOC), is known to deform the atomic
and molecular angular momentum distributions under
the inﬂuence of combined electric and magnetic ﬁelds or
collisions. Moreover, it has been shown theoretically [5]
that AOC can be induced by a purely electric ﬁeld with-
out the need for magnetic ﬁelds or collisions whenever the
initial alignment is not exactly perpendicular or parallel
to the external electric ﬁeld. In this letter, we report the
experimental observation of AOC in the presence of only
an electric ﬁeld. Our measured signals are described ac-
curately by a detailed theoretical model, which could be
of interest in studying potential backgrounds for electron
EDM searches in atomic or molecular systems.

Angular momentum alignment means that the popu-
lation of atomic sublevels mJ varies with |mJ |, but +mJ
and −mJ levels are populated equally. When the +mJ
and −mJ levels are unequally populated, the ensemble
is oriented. One can describe the anisotropic spatial dis-
tribution of angular momenta J in an ensemble by an
atomic density matrix ρ [6]. An ensemble is described as

aligned if the distribution of angular momenta contains
a net electric quadrupole moment or oriented if there is
a net magnetic dipole moment. Orientation can be clas-
siﬁed as longitudinal or transverse, with reference to the
symmetry axis. The breaking of the reﬂection symmetry
of an initially aligned population of atoms by converting
the alignment into transverse orientation has been a sub-
ject of theoretical and experimental investigation since
the 1960s, beginning with the work of [7, 8, 9, 10].

The very ﬁrst theoretical works suggested that AOC
may be induced in atoms by a magnetic ﬁeld gradient [7]
or by anisotropic collisions in which the angle between
the collision axis and the alignment axis diﬀers from 0
and π/2 [8, 9]. These latter predictions were conﬁrmed
by [11, 12]. Orthogonal static electric and magnetic ﬁelds
were used to study Ba and Cs [13], while magnetic ﬁelds
only were used to study AOC in Rb [14, 15], and Na [16].
When a strong pumping laser ﬁeld excites atoms in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the interaction of the dy-
namic Stark eﬀect with the magnetic ﬁeld was shown
to lead to AOC, ﬁrst in Hg [17] and then in other ele-
ments [18, 19]. In particular, a sizeable degree of circular
polarization (c.a. 15%), caused by AOC, was observed in
the (5d6p)1P state of Ba in a femtosecond regime due to
the combined eﬀects of a static magnetic ﬁeld and an elec-
tric ﬁeld from a pulsed laser [19]. Lombardi et al. [10, 20]
measured the appearance of orientation in the 41D2 state
of helium using a capacitative electrodeless helium dis-
charge. In this case, collisions with electrons served as a
source of initial alignment, which was then transformed
into orientation by a combination of static electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. Similar experiments were performed by
Elbel et al. [21]. Since then, there have been experiments
that have shown how AOC can be caused in atomic sys-
tems by magnetic ﬁeld gradients, collisions, and com-
bined electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However, no experi-
mental studies of AOC in atoms in a purely electric ﬁeld
have been reported.

It has been predicted that the quadratic Stark eﬀect
in the presence of an electric ﬁeld only could cause AOC
[22, 23] without any need for magnetic ﬁelds or colli-
sions. In general, linearly polarized light is expected to

produce alignment, but not orientation. However, ini-
tial alignment produced by linearly polarized light can
be converted into transverse orientation when the aligned
atoms are placed in a perturbing electric ﬁeld that makes
an angle with the initial alignment axis diﬀerent from 0
or π/2 and the quadratic Stark eﬀect causes levels with
∆m = ±1 to cross.

In this letter we conﬁrm these predictions with quanti-
tative measurements, which we compare with the results
of a simulation.

In our experiment we studied AOC in the 7D3/2 and
9D3/2 states of Cs. Figure 1 shows the hyperﬁne level
splitting in an external electric ﬁeld for these states,
which are calculated by diagonalizing in an uncoupled
basis the Hamiltonian, which includes the hyperﬁne and
Stark terms [24]. To compute this Hamiltonian, we
use the following atomic constants: hyperﬁne constant
A=7.4(2) MHz [25], scalar polarizability α0 = −6.0(8) ×
104[26], and tensor polarizability α2 = 7.45(20)×104 [27]
in a3
0 units for the 7D3/2 state; and A=2.35(4) MHz [25],
α0 = −1.45(12) × 106[28], and α2 = 1.183(35) × 106 [27]
for the 9D3/2 state.

The circle in each diagram marks a crossing of mag-
netic sublevels with ∆m = ±1. Two sublevels with

∆m = ±1 can be simultaneously excited with linearly
polarized light when they are degenerate in energy and
there is a non-zero angle between the polarization vec-
tor of the exciting radiation and the quantization axis,
i.e., the electric ﬁeld axis. The relative orientations of
the electric ﬁeld E and the laser polarization vectors E1
and E2 and the laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) obser-
vation direction are shown in Fig. 2. In this setup, the
appearance of transverse orientation, that is, orientation
perpendicular to the quantization axis, can be detected
by observing circularly polarized light in a direction per-
pendicular to E as well as E1 and E2.

We make measurements on cesium vapor contained
in a glass cell at room temperature. In order to reach
the 7D3/2 and 9D3/2 states of cesium we use two-step
laser excitation with counterpropagating laser beams (see
Fig. 3). In the ﬁrst step atoms are excited to the 6P3/2
state by a diode laser (LD-0850-100sm laser diode), which
is linearly polarized along the external dc electric ﬁeld E
direction (E k E1). In the second step we use either a
diode laser (Hitachi HL6738MG laser diode) to induce
the 6P3/2 → 7D3/2 transition, or a Coherent CR699-
21 ring dye laser with Rodamin 6G dye to induce the
6P3/2 → 9D3/2 transition. The polarization vector of
the second laser E2 makes an angle of π/4 with respect
to that of the ﬁrst E1 and the electric ﬁeld E (see Fig 2).
An electric ﬁeld is applied via polished stainless steel
Stark electrodes of 25 mm diameter located inside the
cell and separated by a 5 mm gap. The LIF at the
nD3/2 → 6P1/2 transition is observed collinearly to the

laser beams with the help of a pierced mirror. Before en-
tering a monochromator, the LIF passes through a λ/4
plate, which converts circularly polarized light into lin-
early polarized light, allowing us to measure the degree
of circularity C deﬁned as

C =

I(Eright) − I(Elef t)
I(Eright) + I(Elef t)

,

(1)

where I(Eright) and I(Elef t) are the intensities of the
right and left circularly polarized LIF.

The signal is detected by a photomultiplier tube in
photon counting mode and recorded on a PC together
with the electrode voltage. The voltage is applied in dis-
crete steps. During each step, the number of photons is
counted for Eright and Elef t.

The results of our measurements are shown as dots in
in Fig. 4. The circularity C reaches a maximum near
the ∆m = ±1 crossing (circled in Fig. 1). A value of
C as high as 10% is observed in the case of the 7D3/2
state. A small orientation appears at zero electric ﬁeld
because the linewidth of the second laser is suﬃciently
broad to excite coherently magnetic sublevels belonging
to diﬀerent F states. This eﬀect is more prounounced
in the 9D3/2 state because of the smaller hyperﬁne level
splittings. Solid lines show the result of simulations. Our
theoretical treatment builds on earlier models developed
to solve the rate equations for Zeeman coherences for
single-step [29] and double-step [27] laser excitation of
atoms.

The model assumes that the atoms move classically

matrix ρ parametrized by the classical coordinates of the
atomic center of mass. To obtain the density matrix, we
must solve the optical Bloch equations (see, for example,

sity of atoms is suﬃciently low so that diﬀerent velocity
groups of thermally moving atoms do not interact. The
model also accounts for nonlinear eﬀects such as the ac
Stark eﬀect even though they are small in our experiment
because the laser power was low.

We apply the rotating wave approximation for multi-
level systems [31] to eliminate oscillations with optical
frequencies. Since the time scale of the experiment is
large compared to the characteristic phase ﬂuctuation
time of the lasers, we take a statistical average over the

ﬂuctuating phases [29]. We assume that both lasers are
uncorrelated, so that we can apply the “decorrelation ap-
proximation” [29, 32] to obtain a system of equations,
which, when solved, yields the density matrix of the
nD3/2 state, from which the ﬂuorescence intensities in
each polarization are obtained.

We obtained the values of those simulation parameters
that could not be controlled precisely in the experiment
by ﬁtting simulations and measurements of level cross-
ing signals of the same (7,9)D3/2 Cs states, which were
measured under the same experimental conditions [27].
These parameters included the spectral widths of the
laser radiation and the detuning with respect to the exact
hyperﬁne transition frequencies.

The excellent agreement between experiment and the-
ory (see Fig. 4) demonstrates the validity of our theoret-
ical approach.

To convey an intuitive understanding of the AOC ef-
fect, Fig. 4 contain inserts which help to visualize the an-
gular momentum distributions at zero electric ﬁeld, and
at the electric ﬁeld value for which the degree of orienta-
tion was at a maximum. The angular momentum distri-
bution is visualized as a surface whose distance from the
origin in proportional to the probability that the angu-

4

lar momentum of an atom in the ensemble points toward
that point on the surface. This probability is computed
from the components of the density matrix ρmm′ [23, 33].
The theoretical model involves computing the density
matrix ρF F
MM ′ for the manifold of hyperﬁne levels. This
matrix describes the population of certain F states, as
well as the Zeeman coherences inside those states and
between diﬀerent F states. Since we do not resolve spec-
trally the nD state hyperﬁne components that are sepa-
rated by ∼ 10 MHz, it is convenient in the ﬁnal analysis
to pass to the overall density matrix for a ﬁne structure
level. To this end, we need to contract the ﬁne struc-
ture density matrix over the nuclear spin I projections
µ, µ′ and sum over the hyperﬁne structure components
with the expansion coeﬃcients of the ﬁne structure wave
functions over the hyperﬁne structure wave functions

In the absence of the external ﬁeld these expansion coef-
ﬁcients are the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients CF M
JmIµ . If the
electric ﬁeld is present, the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients

must be replaced by the expansion coeﬃcients that can
be obtained by diagonalizing the Stark Hamiltonian.

In summary, we have observed AOC produced by the
quadratic Stark eﬀect in an external electric ﬁeld with-
out the need of any magnetic ﬁelds or collisions. With
the light E vectors and the external dc electric ﬁeld E
forming an angle of π/4, transverse orientation perpen-
dicular to the EE-plane appeared, and gave rise to LIF
signals with a degree of circularity up to 10%. In order to
search for the electron EDM in atomic or molecular sys-
tems, it is often crucial to ensure that the dc electric ﬁeld,
the light polarization vectors, and the residual magnetic
ﬁeld are exactly parallel or orthogonal to each other. As
experiments push the limit even lower, this requirement
will be hard to achieve with the necessary accuracy, and
so AOC could introduce a possible background. Our in-
vestigation shows that AOC can be understood very well
and corrections could be made, if necessary.

Realization of a Laser Cooled Microwave Power
Standard

David C. Paulusse, Nelson L. Rowell, and Alain Michaud∗

June 18, 2002

Abstract– We demonstrate the feasibility of a novel microwave power
standard based on the electromagnetic interaction with laser-cooled atoms.
Under the eﬀect of the radiation, the internal state populations undergo a
Rabi ﬂopping oscillation. Measurement of the oscillation frequency allows
the determination of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength. The measurements
are made over a dynamic range of 18 dB and the standard deviation of the
measurements is about 0.3%. The ﬁeld strength was linear with the Rabi
frequency within the accuracy of our measurements.

Introduction

SINCE the application in the early eighties of concepts related to me-
chanical eﬀects of light the ﬁeld now known as laser cooling and trapping
has become one of the more studied in experimental physics. Reference [1]
gives an index of known links related to quantum optics and laser cooling.
It is updated regularly. The ﬁrst successful applications were in the ﬁelds
of metrology and spectroscopy, where the atoms in an atomic vapour were
probed using laser beams. With these methods the interaction time was

increased by many orders of magnitude. Barely a decade after the initial
experiments, the absolute measurement of the basic unit of time, the sec-
ond, has been improved by a factor of ﬁve with cooling methods. The new
techniques are also expected to improve precision measurements of physical
eﬀects such as gravity, magnetic ﬁeld, rotation of earth, and fundamental
constants.

This paper summarizes our progress towards using the electromagnetic
interaction as a tool in the ﬁeld of microwave power measurements. To this
end we have built a new type of apparatus in which laser cooled Rubidium
atoms are subjected to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Under the eﬀect of the
radiation, the internal state populations undergo a Rabi oscillation. The
measurement of the Rabi frequency allows the determination of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld’s strength.

In the following, we give a short description of the apparatus, we show
how it was used to measure the relative power of a microwave signal, and we
discuss its resolution and how it could be upgraded to provide an absolute
standard for microwave power.

II. Atomic Power Standard

Although the standard practical way to measure microwave power is the
calorimetric technique, several other approaches have been employed [2]. In
one such technique an atomic resonance was used to monitor saturation in
the absorption spectrum of a gas (NH3) ﬁlling a long section (7 m) of waveg-
uide ([3], [2] section 10.10). When the frequency of the radiation was swept
through the resonance (24 GHz), the power could be deduced from the line
shape with knowledge of parameters such as temperature and gas pressure
(relaxation constant).

A. Principle of Operation

Our experiment diﬀers from the one described above because with laser cool-
ing the atoms are not perturbed signiﬁcantly by collisions with the walls or
other atoms. Furthermore since the velocity of the atoms is only a few mm/s,
the interaction time is greatly increased to the point that it is now limited
only by the eﬀect of gravity. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the experimental
setup. A typical measurement involves cycling repeatedly through the three
steps described below:

atoms are trapped in the intersection of the laser beams, then they fall in
front of the waveguide ”2” and in the detection zone ”3”. The glass vacuum
chamber surrounding the vertical laser beam is not shown.

1) Preparation of a cold atom sample
First, approximately 108 atoms of Rb87 are captured in a standard magneto-
optical trap (MOT) [4]. In essence, three orthogonal counter-propagating
laser beams cross at the center of a pair of Anti-Helmoltz coils. The oper-
ating conditions are, (i) The ”cooling laser” must be detuned slightly (-10
MHz) from the 5s1/2, F=2 to 5p3/2, F’=3, atomic transition, (ii) The ”re-
pumping laser” must be tuned exactly to the wavelength of the 5s1/2, F=1
to 5p3/2, F’=2 transition, (iii) Proper laser beam polarization conditions
must be set, and (iv) An adequate gradient of magnetic ﬂux density (about
1 mT/cm) must be present.

Next the magnetic ﬁeld is ramped to zero, the cooling laser is detuned,
and the light intensity reduced. This results in a lower temperature sample
which is called ”optical molasses” ([4] chap. 7). Subsequently a short pulse
of resonant light can be applied to optically pump the atoms in the 5s1/2,
F=2 state. Instead of doing this, however, we use a simpler but less eﬃcient
expedient, that of simply turning oﬀ the repumping light earlier then the
cooling laser.

2) Interaction with the microwave ﬁeld

After the laser beams has been turned oﬀ and the magnetic ﬁeld nulled, the
atoms fall in the interaction zone. At this point all the atoms are in the
F=1 state.

In this experiment, we apply a resonant pulse of a known width and we
measure the population of the level 5S1/2, F=2 at the end of the pulse. We
repeat the experiment varying the pulse length each time. It is therefore
possible to deduce the value of from by evaluating the period of the relative
population of the F=2 state.

In the following analysis, we make the assumptions that there are only
two levels, 5S1/2, F=1 and 5S1/2, F=2, their lifetimes are longer than the
interaction time, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is resonant with the transi-
tion. Under the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld, the populations of both levels oscillate
as described in the following equations:

P1(t) = cos

2

(bt)

P2(t) = sin

2

(bt)

(1)

(2)

Where P1(t) and P2(t) are the relative populations of the states, F=1
and F=2 and the Rabi frequency, b is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld
amplitude. We also assume that the frequency of the transition is much
larger than b, otherwise a more complex model is necessary to describe the
mechanism [5].

3) Detection of population inversion

After the atoms have fallen through the interaction zone they are probed
using a laser beam. There are many techniques to probe the atoms but the
one that we use is the simplest one; i.e. a single resonant laser beam (5S1/2,
F=2 to 5P3/2, F’=3 transition) in the trajectory of the atoms. As the atoms
fall through this laser beam, their ﬂuorescence light is collected, focused on
a photodetector, and the measured intensity is recorded. The amplitude of
this time-of-ﬂight signal is proportional to the population of the level 5S1/2,
F=2 and the total number of atoms in the cloud. A more Eﬃcient system
would use a second laser to probe the atoms in the 5S1/2, F=1 level as well.
As this would be a more complicated detection technique to perform, it has
not yet been implemented despite the anticipated improvements in signal to
noise ratio.

A. Description of the Apparatus

1) Laser system

The laser system is based on three laser diodes. The cooling laser is kept
in resonance with 5S1/2, F= 2 to 5P3/2, F=3 transition. The output of this
laser injects a second laser used as an ampliﬁer. The output power that is
sent to the vacuum chamber is approximately 35 mW.

The repumping laser, similar to the ﬁrst one but tuned to the F=1 to
the F’=0 is necessary to prevent optical pumping. Its characteristics (power
and linewidth) are not critical.

2) Microwave Field

The geometry of the radiating system is very critical. It has to be simple
and symmetrical so that the ﬁeld distribution can be calculated. Moreover
it must have suﬃcient optical access for the many laser beams. To inject the
microwave ﬁeld we have used an open-ended waveguide (R-70, 6.8345 GHz).

For the upper three curves, an oﬀset has been added to the ordinate in order
to allow plotting the curves on the same graph. For the lower curve (3.8
mW), the horizontal axis represents the actual zero and one can observe the
good contrast on these fringes.

This device has been studied [6] and its simple geometry will allow the
construction of a mechanically precise device.

The microwave signal is generated by a synthesizer (Agilent 83620A)
followed by a pulse modulator (Agilent 11720A) and an ampliﬁer (Agilent
8349B). The output power from the ampliﬁer is measured using a thermistor
mount, through a 9.5 dB directional coupler and a NBS type IV bridge (Tech
USA) and a DC voltmeter (Agilent 3457A). The pulse modulator is turned
on for a few seconds and, to compensate for systematic eﬀects such as drift,
the power is measured before and after an experiment is run.

We should mention here that the measurement of a CW signal is in prin-
ciple possible with our system. This would, however, require two laser pulses
that are spaced by a time interval. The ﬁrst pulse would perform the optical
pumping as described previously. The mechanical eﬀect of the second pulse
(F=1 to F’=0) would blow away the atoms that are left in the F=1 state
after a certain time. Following this sequence, the total number of atoms as
a function of the time interval would show the Rabi fringes. Although this
system has yet to be tested, it would allow the measurement of continuous
wave signals.

3) Vacuum chamber

The vacuum chamber consists in a glass cube (50 mm x 50 mm x 90 mm)
attached to a high vacuum pump and a reservoir ﬁlled with rubidium metal.
The laser beams, and microwave ﬁeld are directed onto the atoms through
the optical-quality glass plates forming the walls of the cube. To evaluate
accuracy as a standard, the dielectric loading of the glass will have to be
evaluated or alternatively, a new system could be built, one in which the
waveguide penetrates into the vacuum chamber. For these reasons we have
not attempted to evaluate the absolute accuracy of this standard. Instead
the experimental results in this paper focus mainly on the resolution and
linearity of the system when used as a microwave detector.

III. Experimental Results and Discussions

A. Rabi Frequency

Figure 2 shows four time-evolution plots at diﬀerent power levels. The height
of each dot is proportional to the number of atoms in the F=2 state. The

7

solid curve is derived from a cosine function plus a linear baseline. By virtue
of the laser cooling, the interaction time can be as long as 20 ms limited
only by the eﬀect of gravity. Also, due to absence of collisions in the cooled
atoms, the fringes do not fade signiﬁcantly, as would be the case for atoms
at room temperature.

The noise on those curves is due to the shot-to-shot ﬂuctuation of the to-
tal number of atoms in the sample. Such ﬂuctuation, common with MOT’s,
cannot be reduced signiﬁcantly. However, the system could be improved by
implementing a detection technique in which the readings would be normal-
ized by the total number of atoms in the sample using the two detection
laser method (described above).

Nevertheless even if the time evolution plots are moderately noisy, the
frequency can be estimated with relative accuracy due to the periodic struc-
ture of the curves. This shows the potential for this technique. Also we
see that any oﬀsets or tilts caused by laser frequency drift or variation in
detector performance have little eﬀect on the estimated frequency.

Each measurement cycle lasts about 3 seconds resulting in a total mea-
surement time of about 30 minutes for each plot in Fig. 2. The measurement
time could be reduced by increasing the background gas density, which de-
pends exponentially on the oven temperature. However this was not found
be necessary and the oven was set to room temperature.

Also, the complete time-scans are plotted for illustrative purpose only.
If the power were known approximately, then the measurement of certain
speciﬁc points for every cycle would suﬃce for an accurate frequency esti-
mation. Finally, long-term drift could be measured easily by continuously
monitoring the position of the last fringe.

B. Linearity

We made several time-scans like the ones shown in Fig. 2, to cover a dynamic
range of about 20 dB. The high power end was limited by the maximum
power of the source whereas the lowest measurable power was limited by
the increasingly long interaction times at low power. In power the range
was between 1.5 and 85 mW. A summary of these measurements is plotted
in Fig. 3(a). As expected the Rabi frequency is proportional to the ﬁeld
amplitude.

Figure 3 (b) shows the relative deviation of the points in Fig. 3(a) from
a straight line. It shows that the typical noise on the measurements is about
0.3%. Also we see that, if there is any non-linear dependence, it is smaller

surement over a wider power range will be necessary to verify the linearity
of this device to a higher degree of certainty.

IV. Conclusion and Outlook

We have demonstrated that the precise measurement of the ﬁeld strength
can be done using the electromagnetic interaction with cold atoms. The
standard deviation of the measurements was about 0.3%. The measurements
were made over a dynamic range of 18 dB. Under those conditions, Rabi
frequency was observed to be linear with microwave ﬁeld strength.

Further investigations and improvements stimulated by the present work

include:

Improvements to the system’s design to increase the signal-to-noise ratio,
dynamic range, to allow CW operation, and to eliminate any ﬁeld pertur-
bations in the interaction zone.

A systematic theoretical evaluation considering both the radiation pat-

tern and the magnetic susceptibility of the atomic sample.

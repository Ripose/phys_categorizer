We report the ﬁrst calculation of the interspecies scattering length for the sodium-rubidium (Na-
Rb) system. We present improved hybrid potentials for the singlet X 1Σ+ and triplet a3Σ+ ground
states of the NaRb molecule, and calculate the singlet and triplet scattering lengths as and at for
the isotopomers 23Na87Rb and 23Na85Rb. Using these values, we assess the prospects for producing
a stable two-species BEC in the Na-Rb system.

INTRODUCTION

π(at −

The s-wave scattering length a plays a central role in
the description of atom-atom collisions at ultralow tem-
peratures (T
1 mK). In this regime, the cross section
for elastic collisions, σel = 4πa2, and the cross section
as)2,
for inelastic spin-exchange collisions, σex ∼
are both expressed in terms of a [1]. The scattering
length is also a critically important parameter in the
physics of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). For a
bosonic atomic species i, a BEC is stable only if ai > 0.
In addition, eﬃcient evaporative cooling demands that
σex [2]. The requirements for BEC place a num-
σel ≫
ber of constraints upon the value of the scattering length.
A priori calculations of a are thus of fundamental inter-
est, and the quest for BEC in alkali atoms has spurred on
eﬀorts to calculate the scattering length in many atomic
species.

The scattering length can be calculated directly from
the interatomic potential V (r).
In practice, these po-
tentials are derived from a combination of spectroscopy,
ab initio methods and analytic approximation. Theo-
retically, the scattering length is found by integrating
the radial Schrodinger equation at low collision energies
E and examining the properties of the asymptotic wave
function as E
0. Once determined, a can be com-
pared directly to experiment, providing a valuable test
of the interatomic potential. In the case of Rb, this in-
terplay between theory and experiment has allowed for
a complete characterization of the diatomic interaction
potentials. These potentials yield precise values for the
scattering lengths [3] and enable the accurate prediction
of Feshbach resonances. This achievement underscores
the importance of a in characterizing interactions in di-
lute ultracold gases.

A majority of the work on scattering lengths has con-
centrated on interactions between like alkali atoms. How-
ever, the recent production of Bose-Fermi mixtures in
6Li-23Na [4], 6Li-7Li [5, 6], and 40K-87Rb [7] and dual-
species BEC in 41K-87Rb [8] has renewed interest in

the interspecies scattering length a12 is the basic quan-
tity parametrizing the interactions between component
atomic species. a12 determines the eﬃciency of sympa-

thetic cooling en route to the formation of quantum de-
generate mixtures, and in the case of two-species BECs
(TBECs), a12 determines the stability and miscibility of
these mixtures [9]. However, relatively few calculations of
interspecies scattering lengths exist [10, 11]. This is due,
in part, to the incomplete characterization of diatomic
interaction potentials for many pairs of alkali atoms.

In this paper we calculate the scattering lengths for
the Na-Rb system. Na-Rb is an obvious candidate for
TBEC. Both of the component species have been con-
densed and the condensates have been studied in detail
[12]. The Na-Rb TBEC has been treated theoretically,
and its properties are sensitive to the value of the inter-
species scattering length aN a−Rb [9]. We construct the
NaRb potential from a combination of available spectro-
scopic data and precise long-range interaction parame-
ters. We compare these potentials to similar potentials
for the NaRb molecule [13], and use a simple method for
calculating the singlet and triplet scattering lengths for
the isotopomers 23Na87Rb and 23Na85Rb. We test our
potentials within their experimental or theoretical un-
certainties to establish our errors. Finally, we comment
on the possibility of creating a two-species BEC in this
system.

This paper is divided into four sections.

In Sec. II,
we review scattering at low energies and derive expres-
sions for the scattering length, aN a−Rb. Next, we discuss
the various methods for calculating aN a−Rb, and address
the source of errors involved in these calculations.
In
Sec. III, we introduce two new hybrid potentials for the
NaRb molecule, and contrast our potentials with previ-
ous results. In Sec. IV, we present our calculations for
aN a−Rb, and discuss the feasibility of producing a TBEC
in the Na-Rb system.

If the potential V (r) is known for all r, then the scat-
tering length a can be calculated. The procedure is to
numerically integrate Eq.(1) for low collision energies to
large values of r. At large r the numerical wavefunc-
tion u(r) is “matched” to an asymptotic form χ(r) by
requiring that ∂

ing length a. These expressions require that the function
δo(k) is known for several values of the collision energy
E = ¯h2k2/2µ. For low collision energies, rm should be
large to ensure that the numerical wavefunction attains
its asymptotic behavior. The tabulation of the function
δo(k) can therefore be a time consuming process.

In principle it is much simpler to perform a single in-
tegration at E = 0, and match u(r) to the asymptotic
expression χ(r) = Ar + B at rm. The scattering length
B/A, where a becomes asymptot-
is then given by a =
. The total integration time
ically accurate as rm → ∞
can be reduced even further by calculating the correc-
tions to the asymptotic wavefunction at smaller values
of the match point r = rm. For example, Marinescu
has shown [18] that the wavefunction for large r may
be written as χ(r) = αǫα(r) + βǫβ(r), where the func-
tions ǫα,β(r) are solutions to the diﬀerential equations
ǫ′′
α,β(r) = (2µV (r)/¯h)ǫα,β(r) subject to the boundary
conditions ǫα(r)
. This
equation cannot be solved exactly. However, if an an-
alytic expression for the long-range potential is known,
then the functions ǫα,β(r) may be estimated to arbitrary
precision using a method of successive approximations.
The scattering length is then given by a =
β/α, which
can be found by applying the usual continuity condition
at r = rm.

timated uncertainties will shift the energies of its bound
states, and states lying closest to dissociation experience
the largest shifts. A bound state may even be introduced
or removed from the potential, depending on the size of
the potential shift and the proximity of a bound or vir-
tual level to the dissociation energy. As states are added
or removed from the well, the scattering length passes
through
. Therefore, if the interatomic potential is
not known well enough to predict whether or not a barely
bound state exists, then a cannot be speciﬁed within ﬁ-
nite bounds.

±∞

Because of the extreme sensitivity of a to the binding
energy of the highest vibrational state of the interatomic
potential V (r), the most precise calculations of a in alkali
atoms typically rely on the spectroscopy of bound states
near dissociation. Two-color photoassociation or Raman
spectroscopy is used to resolve these lines to high preci-
sion [20], and accurate model potentials V (r) are used
to calculate the scattering length. For example, theo-
retical values of the C6 coeﬃcient coupled with precise
near-dissociation spectroscopy has given accurate values
for the scattering length in Na [21].
In another tech-
nique known the “accumulated phase method”, details
of the short range potential are replaced by an accumu-
lated phase at zero energy, which is varied, along with pa-
rameters describing the long-range interatomic potential,
to ﬁt the calculated bound states of the model potential
V (r) to the near-dissociation spectrum [22]. The scatter-
ing length is then determined from the “best ﬁt” model
potential V (r). This procedure has given very precise
values for the scattering lengths in Rb [3].

In the absence of near-dissociation spectroscopy, the
scattering length may still be calculated, but the accu-
racy and precision of such a calculation is limited by the
accuracy and precision of the interatomic potential V (r).
In the case of alkali dimers, spectroscopy is sparse and
near-dissociation spectroscopy is non-existent. However,
the potential V (r) may still be “assembled” from RKR
(Rydberg-Klein-Rees) [23] data and well known analytic
expressions for short and long range potentials to create

bars to a, care must be taken to ensure that variations
of the hybrid potential within its estimated uncertainties
does not introduce or remove bound states from the well.
For example, uncertainties in the C6 coeﬃcient of NaK
allowed for additional bound states in its hybrid poten-
tial, and frustrated attempts to determine the scattering
length for some isotopomers [11]. Fortunately, this is not
the case for NaRb, as shown below.

a3Σ+ states respectively, have been determined through
RKR analysis, and a direct ﬁt to the singlet spectrum [26]
using a modiﬁed Lennard-Jones (MLJ) [27] parametriza-
tion has also been performed.

Ab initio ground state potential curves for NaRb have
been calculated [28]. Following the notation of Ref. [13],
we denote the ab initio singlet and triplet potentials by
∆VX and ∆Va, respectively. As seen in Fig.1 and 2,
these curves do not agree with the spectroscopically de-
termined potentials. In particular, they do not correctly
predict the equilibrium bond length Re or the dissocia-
tion energy De. We therefore do not expect these curves
to be useful for calculating the scattering length, and we
prefer not to use them in constructing our interatomic
potentials.

Compared to many alkali dimers, the ground states
of the NaRb molecule are relatively well known. Rovi-
brational states to within 5% of dissociation have been
observed in both the triplet a3Σ+ [24] and singlet X 1Σ+

At large r, the NaRb interatomic potential is accu-
rately represented by a sum of two independent contri-
butions, the exchange and dispersion energies. The dis-

The NaRb molecular potentials can be modeled by

sociation. In addition, they extrapolated Vs(r) to higher
energies and larger r, since it was only known to within
50% of dissociation at the time. The extrapolation pro-

would be given by the NaRb exchange energy, which was
approximated by ﬁtting Eq.(12) to the diﬀerence between
the ab initio ground state potentials, (1/2)(∆VX −

used in constructing the complete long-range potential

They concluded that the a3Σ+ state potential Vt(r) sup-
ported 22 bound states, while the complete X 1Σ+ state
potential Vs(r) supported 82 bound states.

Since the publication of the Z-S potentials, more com-
plete LIF spectra of the NaRb singlet state [26] and a
more precise estimate of the C6 coeﬃcient for NaRb [33]
have become available. Using this new data, we con-
struct new hybrid potentials for both the NaRb X 1Σ+
and a3Σ+ states. For r < 11˚A, we use the recent MLJ
potential to model the X 1Σ+ state. Our potential for
the a3Σ+ state is identical to the Z-S triplet potential for
r < 13.5788˚A. Our long range potential diﬀers from that
used by Z-S in a number of ways. We use the C8 and C10
dispersion coeﬃcients recommended by Marinescu [32],
but choose for C6 the highly precise value calculated by
Derevianko. For the exchange energy, we used the het-
eronuclear expression of Smirnov and Chibisov given by
Eq.(11). Although it is slightly more complicated than
the homonuclear form used by Z-S, Eq.(11) is valid in our
region of interest, and does not depend upon the NaRb
ab initio data, which is known to be inaccurate (see Fig. 1
and 2). Both the singlet MLJ and triplet RKR potential
curves are joined smoothly to our long range potential,

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Na-Rb Scattering Lengths

To calculate the singlet or triplet scattering lengths, we
choose the hybrid potential Vs(r) or Vt(r) and integrate
Eq.(1) at E = 0 from rinner to the match point rm using
the Numerov algorithm [36]. The reduced mass µ is
given by MN aMRb/(MN a + MRb), where M labels the
atomic mass of either 23Na, 85Rb or 87Rb. We expect the
isotopic correction to the internuclear potential V (r) to
be negligible. Following Ref.
[18], the scattering length
is given by

where u(r) is the numerically integrated wavefunction,
and the functions ǫα,β(r) are determined from the long
range potential, as discussed in Section II. We found that
a fourth order approximation to ǫα(r) and ǫβ(r) guaran-
teed convergence to a reliable value of a at a match point
rm = 100˚A. Our results are summarized in Table II.

Because the scattering length is very sensitive to the
details of the interatomic potential V (r), it is important
to ensure that our calculated values of a are stable with

imental or theoretical uncertainties. These include un-
certainties in the value of the dissociation energy De, the
inner and outer turning points of the RKR potentials, the
binding energy of the observed vibrational states, and the
coeﬃcients of the long range parameters. We estimate
our errors by calculating the change in the semiclassical
phase Φ(E = 0) due to the error in each parameter of our
potential. These “phase errors” ∆φ are then summed in
quadrature to give a total phase error ∆φtotal. We con-
vert this value into a scattering length error using Eq.(8).
For the triplet state, the error in a was estimated with

As shown in Table 2, our error bars are small. This is,
in some ways, a fortuitous result. Had a bound or virtual
state been closer to dissociation, variations in the poten-
tial may have caused the phase to pass through a region
where a
. Because the scattering lengths are rela-
tively small, they are more stable with respect to changes
in the corresponding potential. In addition, our hybrid
potentials are reasonably well constrained. This is due,
in part, to the observation of bound states relatively close
to dissociation in the NaRb triplet well, which enabled
Z-S to reduce the uncertainty in the dissociation energy
0.1 cm−1, and the very precise calculation
to ∆(De) =
of the C6 coeﬃcient by Derevianko [33].

One interesting consequence of the new singlet poten-
tial is the appearance of an additional bound state. We
found that our complete X 1Σ+ state potential supported
83 bound states, whereas the corresponding Z-S poten-
tial only supported 82 bound states. This can be un-
derstood by examining Fig. 4, which shows the energy
diﬀerence between the Z-S singlet and MLJ potentials

B. Two-Species Na-Rb BEC

Having calculated the Na-Rb scattering lengths, we
now consider the properties of a mixture of Na and
Rb condensates. The interactions in a Na-Rb TBEC
are parameterized by three scattering lengths: aN a, aRb
and aN a−Rb. The values of aRb and aN a are known
to high precision, and are given in Table III. We con-
sider a Na-Rb mixture in which the Na atoms are in
the state
, and the Rb atoms are in the
state
, where F is the total angular momen-
tum of the atom and m is its projection on the quan-
tization axis. We represent the two-atom state by the
. To calculate the scatter-
ket
ing lengths we use the low-energy elastic approximation
[37, 38], which assumes that elastic collisions dominate
the total cross section for collisions. This approximation
gives for the scattering lengths

a = asPs + atPt,

(14)

where Ps and Pt are the probabilities of the atoms be-
ing in a singlet or triplet state, respectively. To calcu-
late the probabilities Ps and Pt, we project the state

where S and I refer to the total electronic and nuclear

spin of the two-atom system, respectively, while mS,I are
their projections onto the quantization axis. This basis
is useful for characterizing the system at smaller internu-
clear distances where the exchange energy dominates. In
this region, FN a and FRb are no longer “good” quantum
numbers, and the singlet and triplet states are labeled by
S = 0, 1, respectively.

ces USI−F F for both 23Na85Rb and 23Na87Rb, and ex-
tracted the probabilities Ps and Pt for all input chan-

Knowledge of a enables us to calculate the cross section
for elastic collisions, σel = 4πa2. Elastic collisions me-
diate the rethermalization of atoms during evaporative
cooling and sympathetic cooling. Furthermore, knowl-
edge of as and at allows us to characterize the inelastic
losses in the system. The dominant two-body mechanism
for the loss of atoms from a trap is spin-exchange colli-
sions. In this types of collision, the internal spin states of
one or both of the atoms changes. In the case of magnet-
ically trapped samples, such collisions can cause atoms
to be ejected from the mixture by sending them into non-
trappable spin-states. More generally, the atoms may be
ejected if the spin reorientation energy is converted to
kinetic energies greater than the depth of the (magnetic
or optical) potential conﬁning the mixture. In the elas-
tic approximation we can write the cross-section for such
inelastic processes as [38]

σex = Mif π(at −

as)2,

(15)

where Mif is a factor that depends on the asymptotic
hyperﬁne states involved in the collision. Letting primes
denote the asymptotic output channel, we have

Mif = (

where C is the projection coeﬃcient deﬁned above, and
the indices have been suppressed.

The achievement of a miscible two-component BEC
places a number of constraints on the three relevant
scattering lengths. Eﬃcient sympathetic cooling re-
quires a large magnitude of aN a−Rb. Collisional stability
against spin-exchange collisions requires small values of
σex, which implies that the diﬀerence between as and
at be small. Dynamical stability of the individual BECs
requires aN a > 0 and and aRb > 0.
In the Thomas-
Fermi approximation, the criteria for stability implies
= ac above
the existence of a critical value of
which the two-species condensate cannot coexist. The
ac = γ√aN aaRb, where
criteria is given by
aN a−Rb| ≤
|
γ = √MN aMRb/(MN a + MRb) [39]. For aN a−Rb ≤ −

the attraction between the condensates overwhelms the
repulsive interaction within each condensate and they
ac the mutual repulsion
collapse, while for aN a−Rb ≥
of the two condensates is too great for them to overlap
at all.

The single-species scattering lengths are positive for
both 23Na-23Na and 87Rb-87Rb collisions, which allows
for single-species BEC in either atomic species. Using
Eq.(14) and the scattering lengths given in Table II and
Table III, we calculate ac for all asymptotic states in
a 23Na-87Rb mixture. The near equality of as and at
implies that σel will be approximately the same for all
states, and that σex will be small. Therefore interspecies
elastic collisions will dominate inelastic spin-exchange
collisions. Using the mean values for the triplet and sin-
glet scattering lengths given in Table II, we ﬁnd that
for all asymptotic two-atom states, a > ac. Taking into
account the known uncertainties in the various scatter-
ing lengths, we ﬁnd that the inequality a > ac still holds.
We therefore conclude that a stable, miscible TBEC in a
23Na-87Rb mixture is not possible.

F = 2, mF =

Next, we consider the mixture 23Na-85Rb. This is an
interesting case, since BEC has only been observed in
85Rb by utilizing a Feshbach resonance to tune the scat-
state [40]. To sim-
tering length of the
plify our analysis, we eliminate from consideration those
states for which the 85Rb single species scattering length
is negative. Of the remaining states, we choose states
that are lossless with respect to both homo- and het-
eronuclear spin-exchange collisions. Because of the large
positive singlet scattering length in 85Rb, there is a large
variation in ael from state to state. If we use the mean

values for the interspecies scattering lengths given in Ta-
ble II, we again ﬁnd no asymptotic states that satisfy the
condition for TBEC stability. However, unlike the case
of 23Na-87Rb, the inequality a < ac is satisﬁed for nine of
the two-atom states within the bounds of the uncertain-
ties of the various scattering lengths. Of these states,

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived hybrid potentials for the X 1Σ+ and
a3Σ+ states of the NaRb molecule. We compare them to
other recently derived potentials, we discuss why our po-
tentials are preferred. We have calculated the singlet and
triplet scattering lengths from these potentials for both
23Na85Rb and 23Na87Rb. Using the elastic approxima-
tion, we have calculated the scattering length for all two-
atom asymptotic hyperﬁne states for both isotopomers.
The cross sections for elastic and inelastic spin-exchange
collisions can be found using these values. Applying the
Thomas-Fermi approximation criterion for TBEC stabil-
ity, we ﬁnd no two-atom asymptotic states for which a
NaRb TBEC is stable.

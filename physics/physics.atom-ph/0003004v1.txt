Abstract. The experimental determination of the lifetime of pionium provides a
very important test on chiral perturbation theory. This quantity is determined in
the DIRAC experiment at CERN. In the analysis of this experiment, the breakup
probabilities of pionium in matter are needed to high accuracy as a theoretical input.
We study in detail the inﬂuence of the target electrons. They contribute through
screening and incoherent eﬀects. We use Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater wavefunctions
in order to determine the corresponding form factors. We ﬁnd that the inner-shell
electrons contribute less than the weakly bound outer electrons. Furthermore, we
establish a more rigorous estimate for the magnitude of the contribution from the
transverse current (magnetic terms thus far neglected in the calculations).

1. Introduction

In experiments such as atom–atom scattering, atom–electron scattering, nuclear
scattering at high energy, or photo-production of e+e− pairs on atoms one faces the
situation of complex systems undergoing transitions between diﬀerent internal states.
For an atomic target, excitation aﬀects the electrons individually. Thus the “form
factor” for the target-inelastic process takes the form of an incoherent sum over all
electrons, as opposed to the coherent action of the electrons (and the nucleus) in the
target-elastic case. From this observation it is immediately obvious that the target-
inelastic cross section is proportional to Z, the number of electrons in the target
atom, whereas the target-elastic process scales with Z 2. Since incoherent scattering
oﬀ the excited target electrons increases the cross section from its value due to coherent
scattering oﬀ the atom, the eﬀect is sometimes referred to as “anti-screening” [1, 2]. At
large momentum transfer the anti-screening correction can be accurately approximated
by increasing the coherent scattering cross section by the factor (1+1/Z), see e.g. [3, 4, 5].
We will demonstrate in this article, however, that this simple re-scaling argument is not
suﬃciently accurate in general. At the same time we will show how to obtain far superior
results in a Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater approach with manageable numerical eﬀort.

Coherent and incoherent atomic scattering: Formalism and application

2

As an application of the general formalism discussed in this paper, we put our focus
on the particular situation pertaining to experiment DIRAC. This experiment, currently
being performed at CERN [6], aims at measuring the lifetime of pionium, i.e., a π+π−
pair forming a bound state as an exotic, hydrogen-like atom. The pionium is formed from
pions produced in the collision of a high energy proton beam on a (heavy element) target
foil. The kinematical conditions of the experiment imply annihilation of the pionium
through strong interaction (π+π− → π0π0) still within the target foil. The pionium
lifetime will thus be extracted from the exact measurement of the electromagnetic
breakup into π+ and π− while the pionium interacts with the target material.

The paper is organized as follows:

In section 2 we review the well established
formalism for one-photon exchange, applied e.g. in electron–hadron scattering.
In
section 3 the cross sections coming from the transverse photons are estimated with
the help of the long-wavelength limit. The formulas for the evaluation of atomic
form factors and scattering functions in the framework of Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater
theory are derived in section 4, followed by an analysis of simple alternative models in
section 5. Although the results presented in section 6 have been obtained in the context
of experiment DIRAC, many of the conclusions drawn in section 7 are also valid more
generally in atomic scattering.

2. Formalism

In [7] we applied the semiclassical approximation to calculate the coherent (target-
elastic) cross section for pionium–atom scattering. Here we are instead interested in
those processes, where the atom is excited together with the pionium. We will treat
the problem within the PWBA. For our derivation we will follow closely the standard
formalism of electron scattering as found, e.g., in [8, 9, 10].

We only calculate the lowest order result. The relevant Feynman diagram is shown

in ﬁgure 1. The cross section for this process is given by

where W µν
Π are the electromagnetic tensors describing the electromagnetic
interaction of atom and pionium with the photon. As we are not interested in the
speciﬁc ﬁnal state of the atom, we can average over the possible initial spin and sum
over all ﬁnal states and directions corresponding to a speciﬁc ﬁnal state momentum P ′.
For the atom we have

and similarly for the pionium if its ﬁnal state is not resolved either.

The electromagnetic tensor can only be a function of P and P ′, or equivalently, of
P and q. Gauge invariance or current conservation restricts the possible tensor structure
of W µν even more. It is a well known result that the electromagnetic tensor in this case

only depends on two scalar functions W1 and W2 that are functions of q2 and P q alone.
The electromagnetic tensor is then given by

(3)

Since the cross section depends on the product of the tensor for the atom and the

pionium, we calculate this product in terms of W1 and W2:

W µν

A WµνΠ = 3W1,ΠW1,A +(cid:18)−1 +

∆2

q2 (cid:19) W1,ΠW2,A +(cid:18)−1 +

ω2

q2(cid:19) W2,ΠW1,A

where γ is the (relative) Lorentz factor between atom and pionium, ∆ = −PAq/MA,
ω = PΠq/MΠ are (minus) the energy of the exchanged photon in the atom and pionium
rest frame, respectively. Following the argument of [11, 7] we expect the cross section
to be dominated by the charge operator (termed “scalar interaction” in [7]). Thus we
neglect at this point all terms containing a W1. We note also that W1 vanishes in the
elastic case for spin 0 particles. However, the contribution to the cross section coming
from W1 will be discussed in section 3 below in the analysis of the transverse part of
the current operator j. Keeping only the last term and assuming that the pre-factor is
dominated by γ (γ is in the range 15–20 in the DIRAC experiment) we get

W µν
A WµνΠ ≈ γ2W2,ΠW2,A.

(5)

Although this coincides with the naive estimate obtained by superﬁcially identifying the
leading power of γ (assumed to be dominant), one should keep in mind that (as will
be shown below) the range of q2 starts at about (ω/γ)2 or (∆/γ)2, where the last three
pre-factors are of the same order. The magnitude of γ should therefore not be mistaken
as a justiﬁcation for neglecting the terms containing W1. A critical assessment of the
relative importance of W1 as compared to W2 is postponed until section 3.

In our application to pionium–atom scattering the masses MA and MΠ will be much
larger than the momentum transfer q of the photon. Therefore we will neglect recoil
eﬀects on the atom and pionium. We can then identify ∆ and ω as the excitation energy
of the atom and pionium in their respective rest frames. Therefore q0 and qz are ﬁxed
by the values of ω and ∆. In the following we will always denote the spatial part of
the photon momentum in the rest frame of the atom by k and in the rest frame of the
pionium by s. In the rest frame of the atom we then have

One of the advantages of this derivation is that the W2 are scalar functions; we can
therefore evaluate them in the respective rest frames, even though the relative motion
of atom and pionium is relativistic. We now establish a relation between W2 and the
electromagnetic transition currents. As was already done in [7] we assume the charge
operator to be the dominant contribution. In the atom’s rest frame W2 is related to the
‘00’-component of the tensor through

W2,A =

k4 W 00
rf,A,

(10)

see, e.g., [12, 13], with k2 = k2 = ∆2 − q2. Here we have added an index “rf” as a
reminder that the ‘00’-component in the rest frame has to be taken. From the deﬁnition
of W µν we get

Rewriting this expression in terms of the (non-relativistic) density operator and again
neglecting recoil eﬀects we ﬁnd

(Replacing the energy E by the rest mass M in these weakly bound systems only
introduces an error of the order α2). Finally we obtain for the cross section:

(14)

As a veriﬁcation of this formalism we reproduce the result of [7] for target-elastic
scattering. In this case ∆ = 0 and k2 = q2, and the only possible ﬁnal state is X = 0
(assuming no degeneracy of the ground state). We ﬁnd

4α2
β2

1

s4 |F00,A(q)|2"XX

|FX0,Π(s)|2 δ(E0,Π + ω − EX)# ,

(15)

and F00,A(q) is the elastic form factor of the atom. This is identical to the equation
derived in [7] in the Coulomb gauge (k · A = 0).
At this point we should add a few comments regarding the gauge invariance and the
factor q4/k4 (and likewise q4/s4) in (10): In determining the general tensor structure of
W µν in (3) the gauge invariance (or alternatively current conservation) was used. The
magnitude of the component of j along the direction of q is then ﬁxed by ρ. Only
the transverse parts of the current remain independent quantities. Our result therefore
agrees with the one in Coulomb gauge, as in this gauge the component of A along the
direction of q vanishes. An alternative approach might start directly from W µν without
decomposition into W1 and W2. Assuming that in the rest frame of either the atom or
the pionium W 00 dominates, one can approximate the product of the electromagnetic
tensors by

W µν
A WµνΠ ≈ γ2W 00

rf,AW 00
rf,Π

(16)

where the factor γ2 comes from the Lorentz transformation of one tensor into the rest
frame of the other. Now using (16) instead of (10), the cross section reads

"XX ′ |FX ′0,Π(s)|2 δ(E0,Π + ω − EX ′)# .

|FX0,A(k)|2 δ(E0,A + ∆ − EX)# ×

(17)

This diﬀers from (14) by a factor q4/k4·q4/s4. In the elastic case (17) corresponds to the
result of [7] in the Lorentz gauge. However, the approximation (16) and therefore also
(17) is not gauge invariant, whereas (14) is by construction. We will therefore prefer
in the following the form as given in (14). In [7] the diﬀerence between the two results
was interpreted as an indicator for the magnitude of the “magnetic terms”, that is, the
contribution proportional to j. In the next section we will estimate the contribution of
the transverse photons, making use of the long-wavelength limit. It remains to be seen,

Coherent and incoherent atomic scattering: Formalism and application

6

however, which one of the two possible schemes (longitudinal/transverse decomposition
versus scalar/magnetic terms) will be better suited for explicit calculations.

In order to determine total cross sections we would like to simplify the summation
over all possible states. The expression (14) depends on ω and ∆ in two ways:
Through the energy-conserving delta functions and through the expression for q2, where
q2
l = ∆2/(β2γ2) + ω2/(β2γ2) + (2ω∆)/(β2γ) depends on both ω and ∆. Replacing ω
and ∆ in ql by some average values ω0 and ∆0, we can perform the closure over all ﬁnal
states to get

with q2, s2, and k2 now the ones using ω0 and ∆0 and

In section 6 the dependence of the cross section on the choice of ∆0 and ω0 will be
studied by varying both parameters over a reasonable range.

3. Contribution of transverse photons

In section 2 we have only calculated the eﬀect coming from the longitudinal photons
(that is, coming from the charge operator). Already in [11, 7] the eﬀect of the so-
called “magnetic interaction”, that is, the eﬀect of the current operator was estimated
to be of the order of 1%. As the DIRAC experiment requires an accuracy of 1%, these
contributions need to be considered more carefully. The part of the current operator
j in the direction of q is already included in the above calculation. Therefore we need
to study only the contribution coming from the transverse part of the current operator,
that is, the eﬀect coming from the transverse photons. Here we estimate them with
the help of the long-wavelength approximation. Following [12], see also [13], W1 and
W2 can be expressed in terms of the Coulomb and transverse electric (magnetic) matrix
elements:

(18)

(19)

W1 = 2π(cid:0)|T e|2 + |T m|2(cid:1)

W2 =

s2

q2(cid:0)|T e|2 + |T m|2(cid:1)(cid:19) ,

where we use the usual deﬁnitions for M C and T e,m: W 00 = 4π|M C|2 and W λλ′ =
δλλ′2π (|T e|2 + |T m|2) with λ, λ′ denoting the two transverse directions. The T m can
be safely neglected in our case. The long-wavelength limit relates T e to M C. In the
multipole expansions

T e =XJ ≥1XM

for J ≥ 1.

7

(24)

In the case of the pionium only odd multipoles contribute and there is thus no M C
00 term.
As higher multipoles are strongly suppressed we can safely set the factor (J + 1)/J to
its maximum value at 2 (i.e. J = 1) for the purpose of an analytical estimate for
the upper limit of |T e|. However, since our computer program already contains a
multipole expansion, it is of course straightforward to perform a more reﬁned numerical
calculation. For the atom, on the other hand, M C
00 6= 0; it is in fact the dominant
contribution in the elastic process. Although generalizing the relation (24) with the
maximum factor √2 for all multipole orders still provides an upper limit for T e, it may
be a less useful over-estimate for the atom. The relation between |M C|2 and |T e|2 is
then approximately

|T e(q)|2 ≈ 2

(25)

(26)

One sees that the transverse photons contribute to both W1 and W2. Denoting their
contribution by W T

(26) as

First we look at the elastic case (for the atom).

In this case we have ∆ = 0,
rf,A = |F00,A(q)|2. The product of the electromagnetic tensors is then

Again summing over all excited states of the pionium and neglecting the dependence on
ω in q2 and s2 we get the total cross section

s2 (cid:18)−

γ2q4 +

s2(−q2)(cid:19)

The estimate for the reduction of these terms compared to the charge contribution can
be seen easily in this equation, if one assumes that the dominant contributions come
from the range of q2 (and therefore also of s2) of the order of k2
Π, where kΠ denotes the
Bohr-momentum of the pionium, kΠ = 1/aBohr,Π ≈ 136.566/aBohr. This momentum is

Coherent and incoherent atomic scattering: Formalism and application

8

of the order ω/α. Therefore the factor ω2/s2 would give a reduction of the order α2,
making this contribution completely negligible. However, a discussion of the relevant
range of q2 to be given in section 6 will show that this estimate is too crude.

In the inelastic case (on the atom side) we can approximately set ∆0 ≈ 0 again,
as the atomic binding energy is small compared to the other energies. Then the
contribution from the transverse current of the atom will be suppressed even more
than for the pionium, since the ratio ∆/k is even smaller than ω/s. The only diﬀerence
compared to (31) is then the replacement of |F00,A(q)|2 by Sinc,A(k). We get
s2(−q2)(cid:19) Sinc,Π(s) Sinc,A(k).

We will discuss the contribution to the cross section in section 6.

4. Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater model

We now turn to the question how to evaluate the form factors and scattering functions
derived in the general formalism of the preceding sections. For our speciﬁc application
of pionium scattering oﬀ atomic targets, we use the pionium form factors as described
in [7]; here we shall only discuss the calculation of the atomic form factors.

4.1. Atomic ground state elastic form factors

Within the framework of (Dirac-)Hartree-Fock-Slater theory, the atomic ground state
wavefunction entering the expression for the form factor,

Z

F00(k) = hΨ0|

exp(ik · rj)|Ψ0i,

(34)

Xj=1

is given by a single Slater determinant constructed from products of independent particle
orbitals,

Ψ0 =

1

√Z!Xp

sign(p) Φp(1)(r1) · · · Φp(Z)(rZ).

(35)

Here Z denotes the nuclear charge (and the number of electrons), while p denotes the
permutations of orbital indices, and Φj signify single particle orbitals. Each of the Z
exponential terms exp(ik · rj) in (34) acts as a one-particle operator. Orthogonality
of the orbitals eﬀectively cancels the summation over permutations in the bra and ket
vectors leading to

Z

Xj=1

F00(k) =

hΦj(rj)| exp(ik · rj)|Φj(rj)i.

(36)

So far we have not considered any angular momentum coupling of the independent-
particle orbitals, that is, our Ψ0 is determined by a set of quantum numbers
(nj, lj, mj), j = 1 . . . Z, without coupling to a total L (or J) and M. Furthermore
we assumed the ground state wavefunction in the bra and ket symbols to be identical.

Coherent and incoherent atomic scattering: Formalism and application

9

This need not actually be the case, as diﬀerent z-projections M of the total angular
momentum J of the ground state cannot be distinguished (without external ﬁelds).
The angular momentum coupled ground state wavefunction would then be obtained
by summing and averaging over M and M ′ in the bra and ket vectors, respectively.
Likewise on the level of independent particle labels mj, the orthogonality argument
applies strictly only to all orbitals except j, that is, we should distinguish between mj
and m′
j for the bra and for the ket vector, respectively. Since the one-particle operator
does not aﬀect the spin part of the wavefunction, we should also insert an orthogonality
factor for the spin orbitals in bra and ket, χj, χ′
j. Of course the principal and azimuthal
quantum number nj and lj coincide in the bra and in the ket symbol.

Expanding the exponential in spherical harmonics we ﬁnd immediately

F00(k) =

(37)

(38)

where the Rnl(r) denote radial wavefunctions for the orbitals, and jλ(kr) is a spherical
Bessel function.

In a next step averaging |F00(k)|2 over all directions ˆq and using the orthogonality

relation of the spherical harmonics yields

|F00(k)|2 :=

(39)

Obviously all electrons contribute coherently to the form factor, as expected. Due to
the ﬁrst 3j-symbol only even multipoles contribute to the sum.

In the LS-coupling scheme, the atomic ground state is characterized by a speciﬁc
total L and a (possibly averaged) total M. Instead of coupling the individual electrons’
angular momenta to total L and then averaging over M, we average directly over
individual mj, m′
j for the orbitals occupied in accordance with the Pauli principle. This
amounts to neglecting energy diﬀerences between ﬁne structure levels. Hund’s rules
(see e.g. [15]) state that sub-shells are to be ﬁlled by adding as many electrons with
diﬀerent mj and the same spin projection as possible. The critical multiplicity is thus
that for a half ﬁlled sub-shell, (2l + 1). For half ﬁlled or completely ﬁlled sub-shells,
Hund’s rules imply that both mj and m′
j run over all possible values from −lj to +lj.

Coherent and incoherent atomic scattering: Formalism and application

10

Consequently the angular part for these spherical sub-shells reduces to selecting only
monopole contributions. A completely ﬁlled sub-shell (nj, lj) thus contributes

2(2lj + 1)R0

jj(k)

to the full form factor. (The leading factor 2 indicates the spin multiplicity.)

For sub-shells that are neither completely nor half ﬁlled the averaging procedure
yields diﬀerent multiplicities depending on the multipole order. For the dominating
monopole contribution, this factor is simply given by the occupation number of the
sub-shell, whereas for higher multipoles this factor is proportional to the product of
occupation number and the number of holes in a sub-shell with identical spin projections.
For a given number of electrons in an open sub-shell we averaged the m-dependent part
in (39) over all possible distributions of mj and m′

j values.

Note that the coherent (elastic) form factor F00(k) derived above describes only the
eﬀect of scattering oﬀ the atomic electrons. The complete elastic form factor for the
atom reads

FAtom(k) = Z − F00(k),

assuming a point-like nucleus.

4.2. Atomic inelastic scattering functions

(40)

Besides the elastic form factor F00(k) treated in the preceding section, we also need to
consider the contributions due to excitations of the atomic electron cloud. Nuclear
excitations will not be considered here because the much larger excitation energy
required (typically on the order of MeV) exceeds the energy range relevant for our
application to pionium–atom scattering. We demonstrated in [7] that deviations from
a point-like nucleus are negligible for the electromagnetic processes considered here.
Thus the nucleus’ internal structure with its excited states is equally irrelevant as the
experiment DIRAC cannot probe this structure. In analogy to the elastic form factor,
a transition form factor is written in the form

Z

FX0(k) = hΨX|

exp(ik · rj)|Ψ0i,

(41)

Xj=1

corresponding to scattering with excitation of the atomic electrons from the ground
state to some excited state X. A similar expression was studied in [16] in the context of
the equivalent photon approximation. The total inelastic scattering function is deﬁned

Here we have added the ground state in order to exploit the completeness of the set
of states {X}: Expanding the squared modulus of FX0 introduced a second (primed)

set of states {X}. Furthermore we evaluated the sum over the diagonal terms i = j
separately, obtaining the term Z (since exp(ik · [rj − ri]) ≡ 1 in this case). Using the
same Slater determinant wavefunctions for Ψ0 as in the preceding section, expanding
the double sum corresponding to |F00(k)|2, and combining terms with the last sum, we

Except for Z = 58 (Ce, not of interest to us) all atoms with Z ≤ 90 have in their
ground state only one sub-shell that is neither half nor completely ﬁlled [17]. (In atoms
with two open sub-shells, one of them has l = 0.) Thus we need not consider the m-
averaging procedure for cases where mi and mj come from two diﬀerent partially ﬁlled
sub-shells with li > 0 and lj > 0. In the cases of our interest averaging over mi and

sub-shell is less than, or more than, half ﬁlled. For this limited number of cases, we again
determined the m-dependent part by suitably averaging over all possible distributions
of m values in a partially ﬁlled sub-shell.

5. Some other models

For comparison we brieﬂy discuss in this section some simple alternative models for
evaluating the coherent and incoherent form factors, F00(k) and Sinc(k), respectively, for
application in complex atomic scattering. Speciﬁcally, we will use analytical screening
models [18, 19] to derive the elastic form factors. The inelastic scattering functions can
then be obtained from the elastic form factors either in the no-correlation limit, or from
an argument due to Heisenberg and based on the Thomas-Fermi model.

The simplest possible model to describe the eﬀect of incoherent scattering oﬀ the
atom’s electrons would merely divide the cross section for coherent scattering (scaling
with Z 2) by Z, on the grounds that everything remains the same except that each
electron contributes incoherently to the cross section (complete “anti-screening”). We
found that this approach underestimates the incoherent scattering cross section by as
much as 50%. For typical targets like Ti or Ni this implies an error of roughly 2% in
the target-inclusive cross section, clearly beyond the required limit of 1%.

5.1. Elastic form factors

In order to simplify the atomic structure calculation, one might use the Thomas-Fermi
model to replace the density ρ(r) occurring in

F00(k) =Z d3r ρ(r) exp(ik · r).

(46)

Expressing the potential due to the charge distribution of the electrons in the form

V (r) = −

(47)

the corresponding charge distribution is given by the second derivative of the screening
function:

ρ(r) =

χ′′(r).

Here and in the following the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to r. For a
spherical charge distribution the coherent form factor reduces to the monopole term.

for the electronic part, and again FAtom(k) = Z −F00(k). The same analytical form with
diﬀerent parameters Bi and βi determined by ﬁtting expectation values of powers of r
to exact Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater results is used in [18] where the ﬁtting parameters
for all Z ≤ 92 may be found as well.

5.2. Inelastic form factors: No-correlation limit

Inserting the elastic form factor of the previous subsection into (42) we are left with the
evaluation of
Z

hΨ0| exp(ik · [rj − ri]|Ψ0i = Z(Z − 1)Z d3r d3r′ N2(r, r′) exp(ik · [r − r′]) (53)

Xi=1 Xj6=i

where we have already integrated over all variables not pertaining to the orbitals i and j.
Here the function N2(r, r′) describes the probability of ﬁnding any two of the properly
anti-symmetrized electrons at positions r and r′. The no-correlation limit now replaces
this two-particle density by the product of the single-particle probabilities ρ(r)/Z and
ρ(r′)/Z. The integral in the last expression then reduces to |F00(k)/Z|2, i.e., the square
of the elastic form factor normalized per electron. As there are Z(Z − 1) such terms in
the double sum over i, j, we ﬁnally ﬁnd
Sinc(k) = Z − |F00(k)|2/Z.

(54)

Using the elastic form factor of the previous subsection, this result provides a simple
expression for Sinc. However, we have made here the crucial assumption that there is
no correlation between the electrons in diﬀerent orbitals.
In a single-particle picture
this amounts to assuming that all single-particle states are available for all electrons
simultaneously. Pauli blocking, i.e., the fact that due to the Pauli exclusion principle
some states X cannot be excited for a given electron because they are occupied by other
electrons, is then disregarded completely. Since in this limit the (incoherent) summation
over X also includes the Pauli blocked states, the expression (54) clearly overestimates
the correct scattering function.

5.3. Thomas-Fermi model for incoherent scattering

Following Heisenberg [20] we can ﬁnd a simple expression for the incoherent atomic
form factor, going beyond the no-correlation limit but remaining in the spirit of the
Thomas-Fermi model (see also [21]). Expanding the squared modulus in the incoherent
sum (43) we write

which reduces to the Thomas-Fermi expression for r = r′. (55) now contains additional
six-fold integration over d3κ and d3κ′. Performing these integrations as well as the
integration over (r − r′), we ﬁnd (following Heisenberg’s argument about the common
volume of two intersecting spheres in momentum space, and paying attention to the
spin multiplicity)

Sinc(k) = Z −

From (59) and (62) we note that this simple model does not reproduce the correct limit
as k → 0: In this limit r0 → ∞, and the integral in (62) assumes a constant non-zero
value. Thus Sinc grows linearly with k. By contrast the expression in the no-correlation
limit (containing F00(k)) grows with k2, as does the Hartree-Fock-Slater result derived
in the preceding section (since the term linear in k drops out of the expansion in (42)
due to the symmetry under interchange i ↔ j).

6. Numerical method and results

In our application to scattering of pionium on atomic targets, we use hydrogenic
wavefunctions for the pionium system π+π−. The corresponding form factors F00,Π
and Sinc,Π are evaluated analytically as described in [7].

Section 4 provides expressions for the evaluation of coherent atomic form factors
and incoherent scattering functions in the framework of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater
formalism. In our calculations we start from a simple analytical charge distribution for
the electrons as given e.g. in [18] or similarly in [19]. Taking the electronic structure of
the elements from [17] we solve either the Schr¨odinger or the Dirac radial equation for
each occupied orbital, treating exchange eﬀects by Latter’s approximation (see e.g. [18]).
The resulting charge density is then used to obtain improved radial orbitals, iterating
the process until self-consistency is reached. Even for heavy elements with electrons in
some twenty diﬀerent orbitals and requiring several ten iterations, this calculation is
readily performed with the help of the program package RADIAL [22].

Using these orbitals we evaluate the radial integrals in (39) and (45) on a reasonably
dense mesh of k values with the help of an integration routine developed for integrals
containing spherical Bessel functions and powers [23]. To this end, the numerical
solutions for the orbitals obtained on a grid of r values are replaced by piecewise splines.
The angular parts for the partially ﬁlled sub-shells are determined by averaging over all
distributions of magnetic quantum numbers m in accordance with the Pauli principle,
as described in section 4.

Let us ﬁrst investigate the range of q⊥ relevant for the cross section as given by (9)
or (18). Figure 2 demonstrates the interplay of diﬀerent momentum scales associated
with the photon, with the atom, and with the pionium, respectively. The ﬁgure shows
the integrand from (9) in singly diﬀerential form:

Figure 2. Various contributions to the integrand for the cross section vs. q⊥, on a
log-log scale. To compensate for the logarithmic q⊥-axis, the integrand is represented
as dσ/d ln q⊥. The cross sections correspond to target-elastic (solid lines) and target-
inelastic (dashed lines) pionium scattering oﬀ Ni (Z = 28) at a projectile energy
E = 5 GeV, summed over all ﬁnal states of the pionium. The arrows at the upper
edge indicate the relevant momentum scales. See text for details.

The solid lines refer to the total cross section (i.e., summed over all pionium ﬁnal
states) for target-elastic scattering oﬀ Ni (Z = 28) for pionium in its ground state. The
projectile energy is 5 GeV. The dashed lines correspond to the same setting for the
target-inelastic process. Here the integrations over ω and ∆ in (9) have been replaced
by setting an average excitation energy for the pionium at ω0 = 1.858 keV (ground
state binding energy), and for the atom we set ∆0 = 0 (target-elastic) and ∆0 =100 eV
(target-inelastic), respectively.

The arrows indicate the relevant momentum scales: ql for the photon, kTF =
Z 1/3/aBohr for the atom, and kΠ for the pionium. The arrow on the left under the label
“ql” corresponds to target-elastic scattering, while the one on the right corresponds to
incoherent scattering (with non-zero ∆0 and thus with a larger ql). For q⊥ ≪ ql, the
photon momentum is essentially given by the constant ql. When q⊥ ≫ ql, on the other
hand, this part displays a 1/q4
⊥ behavior. The atomic part shows an increase between
ql and several inverse Bohr radii (indicated by kTF). As expected, |F00,A(k)|2 grows
roughly with q4
⊥. At q⊥ ≈ 5kTF the atomic part
reaches its asymptotic value (Z 2 or Z, respectively). In this regime the pionium part
only just starts to contribute appreciably. It grows quadratically with q⊥ to saturate
at a few multiples of the pionium scale kΠ. The product of the three factors clearly
demonstrates that the main contributions to the cross sections come from the range of

⊥, whereas Sinc,A(k) grows only with q2

q⊥ between kTF and kΠ.

In ﬁgure 2 we set ω0 = Ebind,Π for the pionium, as well as a non-zero value for
∆0 in the case of incoherent scattering. The speciﬁc choice for these average excitation
energies is guided by the following observations. For coherent (target-elastic) scattering
∆0 ≡ 0, and any ambiguity in calculating total cross sections from (18) is limited to the
choice of an appropriate ω0. From a comparison [7] of total cross sections for coherent
scattering in the closure approximation with the “exact” total cross sections obtained by
accumulating partial cross sections for bound-bound and bound-free pionium transitions
(summation/integration over all ﬁnal states), we note that bound-bound transitions
(excitation and de-excitation) account for the major part of the total cross section.
Typically, breakup (ionization) accounts for some 30%–40% of the total cross section in
the ground state, decreasing roughly by a factor n2 for pionium in the initial state (n, l).
Furthermore, most of the breakup cross section from a given initial state comes from
the range of continuum energies from 0 to about Ebind,Π above the continuum threshold.
Therefore the average energy diﬀerence between initial and all ﬁnal states—weighted
by their contribution to the total cross section—is of the order of the binding energy
Ebind,Π.

Figure 3a) shows the total cross section for elastic scattering in the closure
approximation as a function of ω0 (in units of Ebind,Π). The total cross sections have been
normalized to their values at ω0 = 0. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, only the ground
state total cross section varies appreciably over a reasonable range of ω0 values. We
also ﬁnd [7] that the closure cross sections at ω0 = Ebind,Π coincide with the converged
accumulated partial cross sections. We therefore set ω0 = Ebind,Π in the following.

Integrand for incoherent (target-inelastic) cross section of ground state
pionium scattering oﬀ Ti at energy 5 GeV, versus q⊥ (on a log-scale). Calculations
with ω0 = 1.858 keV and ∆0 = 0.

In frame b) of the same ﬁgure we show the dependence on the average atomic
excitation energy ∆0 for the target-inelastic scattering process. Here the pionium energy
has been ﬁxed at ω0 ≈ 1.858 keV. Since we calculate Sinc(k) using individual orbitals, we
can easily determine the contributions resolved with respect to atomic shells, or even per
individual electron as in ﬁgure 3b). The average excitation energy ∆0 for each curve has
been normalized to the (average) binding energy of the individual shells. We note that
the individual contributions are roughly proportional to the principal quantum number
of each electron. Combined with the fact that the outer shells typically accommodate
many more electrons than the inner shells, we ﬁnd that the target-inelastic (incoherent)
scattering process is clearly dominated by the loosely bound outer electrons. At the
same time ﬁgure 3b) also demonstrates that the incoherent scattering cross section is
almost independent of ∆0. Thus we may safely set ∆0 = 0 in our calculation.

As a veriﬁcation and further illustration of these ﬁndings, ﬁgure 4 displays
dσinc/d ln q⊥ for ground state pionium scattering incoherently oﬀ Ti (Z = 22) at 5 GeV
projectile energy. The solid line corresponds to the integrand for incoherent scattering
(18) calculated using (45). In these calculations we set ω0 = 1.858 keV, the binding
energy of the pionium, and ∆0 = 0. As can be seen from the dashed line in the ﬁgure, the
simplest approximation consisting of scaling the target-elastic (coherent) cross section
by 1/Z clearly underestimates the correct result. At the same time the dash-dotted
(chain) curve shows that the approximation using the coherent form factor (39) in the
no-correlation limit obviously overestimates the correct result. Furthermore, the dotted
lines show the contributions to the incoherent scattering cross section resolved according
to atomic shells. A direct comparison of the areas enclosed between the individual lines
and the abscissa demonstrates that the ten M-electrons dominate the cross sections,
followed by the eight L-electrons. Also, the two N-electrons contribute considerably
more strongly than the K-electrons, whose inﬂuence is limited to rather large q⊥ as

expected.

Figures 2 and 4 show clearly that the principal contributions to the cross sections
come from the region kTF < q⊥ < kΠ. Thus the long-wavelength limit applies for the
pionium (but not for the atom). Furthermore we noted that the relevant excitation
energy ∆0 is small and may safely be set to zero, and thus W1,A = 0. Under these
circumstances the cross section due to the transverse part of the current operator is
given by (31) and (33). In ﬁgure 5 we show the ratio between the cross sections for
the transverse electric part (T e) and the one for the Coulomb part (M C), as a function
of the average pionium excitation energy ω0. Note that the ratio is given in per cent.
The solid lines correspond to total cross sections for coherent scattering of pionium in
various initial s-states as indicated in the ﬁgure. The dashed lines correspond to the
target-inclusive process (with ∆0 = 0). At the typical average pionium excitation energy
ω0 = Ebind the transverse cross section σT for coherent scattering amounts to 0.4% of
the Coulomb part in the ground state, decreasing rapidly for initially excited states of
the pionium.

Finally ﬁgure 6 compares various models for F00,A and Sinc,A over the range of k
values relevant for our calculations of cross sections in the context of experiment DIRAC.
The solid lines correspond to our calculations using (39) for the coherent form factor
and (45) for the incoherent scattering function, respectively. We use relativistic Dirac
orbitals in both cases. The squares represent tabulated values from two compilations
of state-of-the-art Hartree-Fock calculations with various corrections (conﬁguration
interaction, relativistic eﬀects, a.s.o.). Note that while the tabulated results for F00
correspond to relativistic calculations [24], the tables for Sinc in [25] contain only non-
relativistic results. The log-log representation in the left frame serves merely to display

the Thomas-Fermi-Moli`ere model misses features of the atomic shell structure, but the
resulting deviation from (39) is insigniﬁcant. Much more problematic are the crude
approximations for Sinc. While the no-correlation limit (54), using (52) and shown with
the dotted line, increases with k2 at small k (as it should), it dramatically overestimates
the scattering function in the most relevant range between 0.1 and 100 a.u. On the other
hand, the Thomas-Fermi model for incoherent scattering as developed by Heisenberg
[20], with modiﬁcations [21, App. B] for the use of Moli`ere’s approximation, is quite
successful at k ≥ 5 a.u., but it fails completely at smaller k.

7. Conclusions

We have reviewed the formalism for incoherent atomic scattering. The basic expressions
for the atomic form factors and scattering functions have then been evaluated in
the framework of Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater theory, i.e., using numerically determined
electron orbitals. For comparison, both the form factor for coherent scattering, as well as
the incoherent scattering function have been derived in simple analytical models based
on the Thomas-Fermi model of the atom. Applying these diﬀerent descriptions we
performed detailed numerical studies in the context of pionium scattering incoherently
oﬀ the electrons of various target atoms. Due to the much larger reduced mass of the
pionium system (µΠ = mπ/2 ≈ 136.566me), the length and momentum scales of the
pionium and the target atom are very diﬀerent.

An investigation of the relevant momentum transfer q⊥ revealed that the cross
sections are dominated by the contributions from the region between the Thomas-

pionium at kΠ = µΠ/aBohr. Under these circumstances the simple models for incoherent
scattering discussed in section 5 prove not suﬃciently accurate for our application in
the context of pionium–atom scattering with a required accuracy of 1% or better.
Whereas the analytical models discussed in section 5 provide suﬃciently accurate
coherent form factors, the incoherent contribution really requires the more accurate
treatment developed in section 4, despite its lesser importance (as compared to coherent
scattering). Only an explicit DHFS calculation can provide satisfactory scattering
functions.

From our detailed discussion of the q⊥-dependence of the integrand for the cross
section we also conclude that the loosely bound outer shell electrons dominate the target-
inelastic cross sections. Their contribution to the integrand dσ/dq⊥ covers a much larger
range of q⊥ values than the one corresponding to inner shell electrons. Following this
argument further, free electrons would show a behavior rather similar to the one of the
outer shells, their contribution to the cross section would stretch even further down to
smaller q⊥. However, the cross section hardly depends on this modiﬁcation at very small
q⊥. Our calculation therefore applies equally well to quasi-free electrons and to electrons
in the conduction band. Thus solid state eﬀects and chemistry need not be considered
explicitly as they prove irrelevant for calculations pertaining to experiment DIRAC. The
same conclusion had been inferred in our earlier study [7] based on an analysis of the
relevant impact parameter range. Recalling that target-inelastic scattering constitutes
merely a correction of order 1/Z of the atomic part, variations on the order of a few per
cent in the incoherent scattering cross sections are insigniﬁcant.

These ﬁndings are conﬁrmed in our analysis of the dependence of the cross
sections on the average excitation energies for pionium and atom. Our calculation
of incoherent scattering contributions resolved according to individual target electron
shells demonstrates that the average excitation energy for the atom may safely be set
to zero, ∆0 = 0. For the pionium, on the other hand, a non-vanishing excitation energy
in the amount of the binding energy is needed when calculating total cross sections in
the closure approximation.

Earlier investigations on pionium–atom interaction [11, 7] invoked properties of
the hydrogen-like pionium system to obtain crude estimates for the magnitude of
the magnetic terms so far neglected in this interaction. From the non-relativistic
wavefunctions for the pionium, its internal velocity is of the order of v/c ≈ α/2. Thus
magnetic terms are believed to be small of this order. We established a much better
justiﬁed estimate for the magnetic terms (actually for the transverse part of the current)
in the long-wavelength limit. Our investigation showed that this limit applies very well
for the pionium, whereas it does not apply for the atom. However, the transverse current
does not contribute in the elastic case on the atom side, and for the inelastic case it
is suppressed even more than the corresponding term on the pionium side because the
relevant atomic excitation energies (of the outer shells) are smaller than those of the
pionium.

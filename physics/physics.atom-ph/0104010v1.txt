Measurements of muon catalyzed dt fusion (dµt →4He +
n + µ−) in solid HD have been performed. The theory
describing the energy dependent resonant molecular forma-
tion rate for the reaction µt + HD → [(dµt)pee]∗ is com-
pared to experimental results in a pure solid HD target.
Constraints on the rates are inferred through the use of a
Monte Carlo model developed speciﬁcally for the experiment.
From the time-of-ﬂight analysis of fusion events in 16 and 37
µg·cm−2 targets, an average formation rate consistent with
0.897±(0.046)stat ± (0.166)syst times the theoretical predic-
tion was obtained.

The idea of introducing a negative muon into a mixture
of hydrogen isotopes to catalyze fusion has been known
for over 50 years [1]. The muon will be quickly cap-
tured by an atom, replacing the orbital electron. This
muonic atom can then interact with an isotopic hydro-
gen molecule to form a muonic molecular ion. The neg-
ative muon is about 207 times the mass of an electron,
thus the two nuclei in the molecule are bound together
very tightly. The negative muon shields the repulsive
Coulomb force between the two nuclei and because of
their close proximity, fusion occurs and the muon can
take part in another fusion cycle. The rate-limiting step
in this process is muonic molecular (or molecular ion) for-
mation. However, the probability of the muon sticking to
the alpha particle after fusion occurs limits the average
number of fusions to approximately 200 per muon.

The theory describing the energy dependent resonant
molecular formation rate for the reaction µt + HD →
[(dµt)pee]∗ has been developed in the last decade. The
high rate is expected [2] to enhance muon catalyzed fu-

sion in triple mixtures of H/D/T. In this letter we re-
port the results of a muon catalyzed dt fusion experi-
ment which conﬁrm this rate. We have performed the
ﬁrst measurement using µt atoms incident on pure solid
HD, measuring energy via a time of ﬂight technique. By
using a Monte Carlo simulation (which employs the the-
oretical energy-dependent rates) we have compared the
experimental results to the theory, thus determining the
resonant molecular formation rate consistent with the fu-
sion time spectra for two diﬀerent HD target thicknesses.
Figure 1 shows the theoretically predicted resonant
molecular formation rate as a function of µt lab energy.
This calculation, normalized to liquid hydrogen atomic
density (LHD), was performed for isolated HD molecules
at a temperature of 3K as had been done at higher tem-
peratures [3]. The rate for HD is then predicted by multi-
plying by the fractional deuteron concentration, Cd=0.5.
The excess collisional energy of the system along with
the released binding energy of the dµt molecular ion is
absorbed by excitation of the entire six-body complex
[(dµt)pee]. Because the dµt ion exists in a weakly bound
state, resonance formation is possible without dissocia-
tion.

The experiment described here has the advantage of
using spatially separated layers of diﬀerent isotopic com-
position in which interactions of the muonic system can
be separated, providing the opportunity to measure the
rate and energy dependence of resonant molecular for-
mation using time of ﬂight.
It is similar to our previ-
ous reported measurement [4] using D2 molecules. Other
experimental eﬀorts in liquid/gaseous triple mixtures at-
tempt to measure this rate, however interpretation is dif-
ﬁcult because of the complex kinetics involved [5,6]. In
the present experiment, solid layers were made by freez-
ing hydrogen isotopic gases and mixtures onto two 51 µm

1

thick gold target foils maintained at 3K. The gas mix-
tures were deposited onto the foils through a gas diﬀuser
[7,8], where they could remain frozen for up to one week.
For the HD target layer, commercial 96% HD gas was
passed through a molecular sieve placed in a liquid ni-
trogen bath to remove nonhydrogen impurities, and was
subsequently monitored during target deposition with a
quadrupole mass spectrometer to conﬁrm nonequilibra-
tion of the gas. It has been shown that at cryogenic tem-
peratures the molecules do not begin to equilibrate for
roughly 200 hours [9]. A nonhydrogen contamination fol-
lowing target deposition was determined to be less than
0.1% through use of a germanium detector which mea-
sured x-rays from muon transfer to high-Z nuclei as well
as gamma rays from nuclear capture.

Figure 2 depicts the target and the muonic interac-
tions which occur. Negative muons having a momentum
near 27 MeV/c travel through one of the gold foils (a)
into the 3.5 mg·cm−2 production layer (b) which consists
of protium (1H2) containing 0.1% tritium (T2). Here
the muon is atomically captured by a proton within a
time of 10−11 s (at LHD) and subsequently transfers to
a triton due to the increased binding energy of µt. The
neutral µt atoms, created with tens of eV energy, es-
cape the production layer before thermalization due to
the Ramsauer-Townsend mechanism which reduces their
scattering cross section on H2. The moderation layer (c),
consisting of 70 µg·cm−2 D2, reduces the energy of the
µt atoms to optimize resonant molecular formation on
the downstream HD target (d) of thickness 16 µg·cm−2.
The µt atoms traverse 17.9 ± 0.1 mm in vacuum to reach
(d). For those at or near the resonant energy, molecular
formation and fusion follow with high probability, pro-
ducing a 3.5 MeV alpha particle and a 14 MeV neutron.
The µt atoms which do not escape the moderation layer
(c) can interact there with deuterium, and subsequent dt
fusion can occur [4].

Alpha particles from fusion in (c) and (d) are separated
by time of ﬂight. The muonic atom emission time from
the production layer, dominated by muon transfer from
proton to triton, is of order 0.1 µs. Resonant formation
rates are of order 109 s−1, while dt fusion occurs in the
molecular ion at a rate of 1012 s−1. Since the two gold
foils are separated by 17.9 mm, a µt atom which travels
through the moderator layer reaches the downstream HD
layer in a minimum time of 0.2 µs, and more typically 2
µs at 1 eV. Thus, the time interval between detection of a
muon entering the target and an alpha from fusion in the
downstream HD reaction layer is dominated by the ﬂight
time of the µt atom. Two planar silicon detectors located
perpendicular to the target foils, each with active area
2000 mm2 and nominal depletion depth 300 µm, detect
alpha particles. A time cut of 1.5 to 6.0 µs, selects fu-
sion events occurring in the HD layer only. The summed
energy spectrum from both silicon detectors, normalized
to the number Nµ of good incident muons (see [4] for

details), is shown in Fig. 3. Background was removed by
subtracting normalized data for which no downstream
reaction layer was present.

A Monte Carlo (MC) program was used to compare
theoretical resonant molecular formation rates to data.
This was necessary as the time-of-ﬂight spectra cannot
be uniquely inverted due to geometrical eﬀects and the
energy loss of µt atoms in the HD reaction layer prior
to molecular formation. The MC code [10] simulates
muonic processes occurring in the experiment (e.g., scat-
tering, muon transfer, muonic molecular formation, fu-
sion), taking into account the dimensions and geometry
of the apparatus. In particular, it uses the rate of Fig. 1,
scaled by Cd=0.5, to describe resonant formation in HD.
The majority of cross sections and rates used in the code
were taken from [11] and [12]. However, experimentally
measured rates for muon transfer (µp → µt) and nonres-
onant pµp molecular formation [13] were used (see also
[8]). Values for the cross section σµt+d equal to 0.9 times
those of [11] were found to better represent the fusion
time distribution observed in the moderation layer [14],
and thus were used in the simulation. These deﬁne our
nominal MC input; the code has been validated through
comparison with independently written simulation code
for simpliﬁed cases for which a direct comparison can be
made [15].

To compare directly the time-of-ﬂight fusion results to
the simulation, the simulations were scaled by the silicon
detector solid angle, ΩSi = (2.32 ± 0.10) × 10−2 and nor-
malized to the fraction of incoming muons which stopped
in the production layer, SF = (32 ± 2)% [14].

The fusion time-of-ﬂight data for two HD targets are
shown in Fig. 4. Both the simulation and data are plot-
ted as fusion events per incident muon Nµ. Figure 4 (a)
shows the results for the 16 µg·cm−2 HD target. The sim-
ulation shows a clear two-peaked structure not evident in
the data. One peak between 2 and 3 µs corresponds to
the molecular formation resonances which occur above
1.0 eV, while the other, between 4 and 5 µs, corresponds
to the stronger resonances near 0.3 eV. Data from the
37 µg·cm−2 HD reaction layer are shown in Fig. 4 (b).
Here, the µt atoms will undergo more scattering reac-
tions before molecular formation occurs and hence are
less sensitive to the molecular formation resonances. This
is clearly visible in the simulation results, where the two-
peaked structure is less evident. The agreement between
simulation and data for this target thickness is quite rea-
sonable (see below). Good agreement was obtained also
for the case of a D2 target layer, as reported previously
[4].

To test sensitivity of our data to resonant molecu-
lar formation rates, several modiﬁcations to the nominal
MC input were made. Diﬀerences from the nominal in-
put (a) include the following: determining the eﬀect of
a decreased σµt+d scattering cross section (b); shifting
the positions of the resonances to higher (c) and lower

2

(d) energies; using an energy independent constant rate
to model molecular formation (e); and broadening the
molecular formation resonances (f). Table I summarizes
the target thickness, input changes to the MC, the ﬁt
ratio RF which is the factor by which the data must be
scaled to provide the best ﬁt to the simulation, and the
χ2 per degree of freedom (dof=49) for the scaled ﬁt. To
provide a check of how well the simulation is reproduc-
ing the absolute intensity observed, the χ2/dof of ﬁts are
listed for RF being held ﬁxed at 1.

To investigate sensitivity to the positions of the molec-
ular formation resonances, they were shifted in the simu-
lation by 0.18 eV (the average standard deviation of the
peaks) to higher and lower energies. The peaks appear-
ing in the simulated fusion time distribution shifted as
expected due to the inverse relationship between the time
of ﬂight and speed of the µt atom. The results given in
Table I show increases in χ2/dof for both the shape and
intensity tests when compared to the simulation results
using the nominal predicted positions of the resonances.
The results are indeed sensitive to the position of the res-
onances, but shifting them does not improve agreement
between simulation and data.

A simulation using a constant molecular formation rate
of λdµt = 200 µs−1, chosen to approximately match the
intensity of the data, was also compared to data. The
χ2/dof for the ﬁt to the 16 µg· cm−2 data is 2.99 com-
pared to 1.87 using the nominal MC input.

To determine whether the discrepancy in shape could
be explained by resonance broadening, the theoretical
resonances were convoluted with a Gaussian of 50 meV
rms, while preserving the area under each resonance.
This MC time distribution for the 37 µg·cm−2 data did
not reproduce the data as well as the nominal simula-
tion. For the 16 µg·cm−2 data, the two-peaked structure
remained in the MC, with the distribution of both peaks
quite broad and a factor of 1.6 higher in yield than the
data for the time range between 3.0 and 6.0 µs.

To determine the best value for the number (Sλ) by
which the resonant molecular formation rate should be
scaled to agree with the data, simulations were done for
Sλ between 0.50 and 1.40 (Sλ = 1.0 corresponds to agree-
ment with theory) and the results were then ﬁt to the
data. The χ2 values of these ﬁts versus Sλ allow esti-
mation of the scaling factors for the 16 and 37 µg·cm−2
targets of, respectively, 0.798 ± 0.060 and 1.040 ± 0.072,
which are not in agreement within their quoted statis-
tical errors. As the signiﬁcant known systematic errors
in the experiment (such as solid angle and stopping frac-
tion) are common to both the 16 and 37 µg·cm−2 tar-
gets, they cannot be used to reconcile the scaling factors,
pointing to an unknown systematic error or inadequacy
of the simulation for which an additional systematic un-
certainty of unknown origin must be determined. Using
the method described in [16], where the assessed uncer-
tainty is increased to reﬂect possible unknown sources

of error, an uncorrelated systematic uncertainty of 2.38
times the statistical uncertainty is added in quadrature
with the correlated systematic uncertainty. The average
scaling factor for both targets is then found to be 0.897
±(0.046)stat ± (0.166)syst.

The scaling factors for the resonant molecular forma-
tion rates for the targets studied are given in Table II.
The experimental results conﬁrm the high HD resonant
rates expected at these energies. However, the fusion
time spectra structure is not conﬁrmed, in contrast to
the results for D2 [4]. The two-peaked structure pre-
dicted by the Monte Carlo results for the thin HD target
is not apparent in the data. Several adaptations to the
resonant molecular formation theory were investigated,
but this peaked structure persists in the MC. On the
other hand, using a constant rate to describe molecular
formation modeled the data less accurately than the res-
onance model. In the thicker HD target where resonant
molecular formation competes with scattering of the µt
atoms and hence energy loss, agreement between theory
and data is quite good. The theory developed for the
resonant process does not take into account any eﬀects
of the crystal lattice or its motion with respect to the
µt atoms. It has been suggested that eﬀects in the solid
hydrogen crystal lattice may aﬀect the µt slowing pro-
cess and thus the reaction yields [17]. Incorporating such
eﬀects into the simulation is a logical next step.

Theoretical energies and transition probabilities of argon

I. M. Savukov∗

(Dated: December 30, 2013)

Argon energies of J=1 odd and J=2 even states, oscillator strengths of the two lowest J=1 odd
states, and line strengths for transitions between J=1 odd and J=2 even excited states are calculated
with the CI+MBPT method. The results are in good agreement with experiment.

INTRODUCTION

integrals, are signiﬁcant.

Given that a combined conﬁguration-interaction (CI)
and many-body-perturbation-theory (MBPT) approach
could describe well experimental data for energies and
transition rates in neon, it was a natural continuation
to investigate a more diﬃcult, stronger core-correlated
atom such as argon. In argon theories and experiments
appear to be less accurate than in neon, with larger mu-
tual disagreement; moreover, heavier closed-shell atoms
are even less studied and understood so that the argon
atom can serve as an intermediate step in understanding
many closed-shell atoms and ions.

Although semiempirical calculations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sometimes lead to a good agreement with experiment for
some transition arrays and provide valuable information
for the analysis of existing experimental data, they do
not explain much the nature of correlations and their
predictive power is limited to cases where (a) energies
are well-known and (b) energy-level information is suﬃ-
cient to infer other atomic properties such as transition
probabilities. In general two theories could give exactly
the same energy levels without predicting the same tran-
sition probabilities. For example, adding or not adding
random-phase approximation (RPA) corrections to tran-
sition amplitudes will give two diﬀerent answers for tran-
sition rates although wave functions obtained from the
same eﬀective Hamiltonian are identical. When RPA
corrections were included in neon [6], the improvement
of agreement with experiment was only marginal and it
was not an issue, but as we will show in this paper this
type correction is crucial in argon. Hence, theories, which
do not take into account at least the RPA correction, can
be misleading in argon and heavier noble gas atoms. Still
owing to cancellations of RPA contributions for the same
transition array, ratios obtained with a matrix method
could be still accurate.
Indeed, a fair agreement with
experiment for low-lying argon transitions is obtained
by Lilly [1] even without considering RPA corrections.
However, the accuracy of ratios decreases if relativistic
and correlation eﬀects, that introduce asymmetry for the
p3/2 and p1/2 hole RPA contributions to radial transition

Another issue is the role of conﬁguration interaction
since many theories are limited by considering only a few
conﬁgurations. The convergence of CI has to be investi-
gated. Furthermore, other many-body eﬀects, such as an
interaction of a valence electron with a core or a hole with
a core or their combination, are quite signiﬁcant in argon
and heavier noble-gas atoms. Thus, the development of
ab initio theory for heavy noble-gas atoms is needed to
single out important correlation and relativistic eﬀects.
Some success is already achieved in this direction. For ex-
ample, elaborate ab initio calculations by Avgoustoglou
and Beck [7] performed for transitions from the lowest

odd excited states
to the
ground state give oscillator strengths in good agreement
with average experimental values. However, this theory
was not extended to transitions between excited states.
Therefore, one objective of this paper is to prove that
transitions between excited states of argon can also be
calculated with ab initio methods. We also would like
to show that for argon our simpler CI+MBPT theory
has comparable accuracy to complicated single-double
couple-cluster (SDCC) method of Ref. [7] and thus can
be of practical value for other theoretical groups.

In this paper, ﬁrst we will brieﬂy describe our method
of calculations (more details are given in [8, 9]); then,
we will calculate energies and oscillator strengths of J=1
odd states and energies of J=2 even states and compare
them with experiment. This comparison gives an esti-
mate on accuracy of our wave functions. Next, we will
present line strengths and rates for transitions between
excited states and compare our result with experiment
and semiempirical calculations.

II. CI+MBPT METHOD

We have developed a convergent variant of CI+MBPT
for particle-hole states of closed-shell atoms [9] and suc-
cessfully applied it in neon to calculate energies [8]
and oscillator strengths for transitions between excited
states [6]. This perturbation theory is based on the ﬁrst
iteration of couple-cluster single-double equations [10,
11]. All second-order MBPT terms [12] are included,
with some denominators being modiﬁed to take into ac-
count the strong interaction between a hole and a core

electron or core and core electrons non-perurbatively [8,
9]. The advantage of this approach compared to the it-
erated single-double method [11] is simplicity and speed
of calculations. The accuracy of hole energies and ﬁne-
structure splittings is signiﬁcantly improved already af-
ter adding second-order MBPT corrections as was illus-
trated previously in neon. Apart from Coulomb correla-
tion corrections, the Breit magnetic interaction is also in-
cluded, but small frequency-dependent Breit, quantum-
electrodynamic,
reduced-mass, and mass-polarization
corrections are omitted.

To calculate particle-hole energies, we construct a
model CI space, compute eﬀective Hamiltonian in this
space, and solve an eigenvalue problem. Along with en-
ergies we obtain wave functions, which are used to cal-
culate transition amplitudes or other related quantities.
We investigate energies, oscillator strengths for transi-
tions to the ground state, and line strengths or transition
rates for transitions between excited states. Energies of
neon particle-hole J=1 odd states and oscillator strengths
were in very good agreement with experiment: pure ab-
initio neon energies diﬀered from experimental energies
by 0.0069 a.u., but after subtraction of the systematic
shift (which does not make much diﬀerence in transition
calculations), the agreement was at the level of 0.0001
a.u. for almost all states. In this paper we use the same
approach to calculate energies and transition amplitudes
of argon.

Reduced matrix elements for transitions between

particle-hole excited states are given in Ref. [6]:

are signiﬁcant in argon. This type correction requires
careful analysis since the possible interaction between an
“observing” hole state a and core states b over which
summation is carried out should be taken into account in
all orders, at least a bulk part of this interaction. Similar
to our approach for energies, we include the interaction

III. CALCULATIONS FOR ARGON

A. Energies of argon odd J=1 states

Table I shows our calculated energies for J=1 odd
states. Fine structure for the 4s, 5s, or 4f groups of states
is well reproduced since the deviation from experiment
for each ﬁne structure group of levels is similar. The last
column shows shifted deviations from experiment, which
demonstrate that there is a systematic shift for energy
levels in our calculations. This shift is due to the inac-
curacy of our calculations of hole energies. The shifted
deviations illustrate a good precision for higher excited
states which have smaller correlation eﬀects. We also
show the convergence with the number of particle-hole
conﬁgurations. The change in energy is signiﬁcant when
we increase the size of CI space from 22 to 32 and to
52; however, from 52 to 62 the change is small, and we
consider that CI-52 case is optimal.

B. Oscillator strengths of resonant transitions

3/24s]1 and [3p−1

We calculate oscillator strengths for well-studied ex-
perimentally and theoretically resonant argon transi-
tions. The upper and lower panels of Fig. 1 show data
for the [3p−1
1/24s]1 states, respectively. The
agreement with SD CC calculations [7] and most experi-
ments is very close. For the weaker transition, deviation
from the SD CC theory is somewhat larger, which is due
to cancellation of contributions from diﬀerent conﬁgu-
rations. Such cancellation was more complete in neon,
where we observed larger disagreement with the theory
of Ref. [7].

C. Energies of argon even J=2 states

Table III shows our calculated energies for J=2 even
states. Results for these and J=1 odd states are similar:
ﬁne structure for 4p, 5p, or 4f states is well reproduced; a
small systematic shift exists due hole energy oﬀset which
if subtracted brings theory in a better agreement for less
correlated higher excited states. The convergence with
the number of particle-hole conﬁgurations is achieved for
the size of CI space 48.

D. Argon transitions between excited states

Table IV shows the comparison of our calculations with
experiment for line strengths between J=1 odd and J=2
even state transitions. Very large disagreement is ob-
served when no RPA correction is added. However, if
conventional RPA correction (Eq.1) is included, the dif-
ference is also large, though of an opposite sign. And only

if we include the appropriate, modiﬁed-denominator RPA
correction (mRPA), which constitutes roughly a half of
the conventional RPA correction, do our values agree
with experiment at the level of the experimental accu-
racy. The experimental accuracy in Table IV is denoted
by letters in accordance with the NIST convention: for
example, the accuracy of class “C” is about 10%. Still in

3/24p transition the disagreement
the case of the p
is quite large and independent of RPA corrections which
might indicate that the problem is in the experiment. If
we exclude this case and the inaccurate measurement of
class “D” , then mRPA calculations can be considered
accurate at the level of 10-20%.

In some cases, semiempirical
results are close to experiment, but in others they can
deviate substantially, by orders of magnitude, and they
also disagree with each other. For example, for weak
transitions, transition rates of Lilly [1] are about 10 times
larger than experimental values; for these transitions re-
sults of Garstang and Blerkom [2] are much better. Our

where experiments have good precision.

For one particular transition at 430 nm, many mea-
surements have been conducted, and this transition can
be considered to be known most accurately among other
transitions between excited states of argon. In Fig. 2 we
compare our theoretical value with many available ex-
perimental values. While six experiments support NIST
quoted value, a greater number of experiments support
our theoretical value. Therefore, we tend to concluded
that NIST values can be somewhat wrong. We also
ﬁnd that semiempirical calculations are not able to pre-
dict these particular experiments; namely, most exten-
sive semiempirical calculations [1] give the transition rate
1.33 × 106 s−1 that disagrees with all experiments. Re-
turning to our Table IV, we can argue that some large
deviations of our theory from experiment can be caused
by inaccuracy of quoted experimental errors.

For better tests of our theory, more accurate experi-

particle-hole states. Our theoretical energies and transi-
tion rates are in good agreement with most experiments.
We found that random-phase approximation corrections
are essential. We also analyzed dependence of accuracy
on the size of conﬁguration space and determined the op-
timal size of CI matrix. Our CI+MBPT program can be
used for calculations of many other transitions of closed-
shell atoms and ions.

ments are needed. For this reason, we have measured
the ratio of line strengths using an accurate laser absorp-
tion technique [42]. Our experimental ratio, 3.29 ± 0.13,
for the two transitions at 9787 ˚A and 9227 ˚A completely
agrees with our theoretical value, 3.22. It would be ex-
tremely interesting if this experimental technique was
further developed and applied to other transitions in ar-
gon or in other noble gas atoms. For example, experi-
ments in neon using visible lasers could test the accuracy
of this experimental method, since our theory is expected
to be more accurate in neon than in argon.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have applied CI+MBPT theory
to calculate energies and transition properties of argon

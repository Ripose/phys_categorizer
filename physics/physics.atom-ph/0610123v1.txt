Generally, the onditions for deep sub-Doppler laser ooling do not math the onditions for

the strong atomi loalization that takes a plae in deeper optial potential and, in onsequene,

leads to larger temperature. Moreover, for a given detuning in a deep optial potential the seular

approximation whih is usually used for quantum desription of laser ooling beomes no more valid.

Here we perform an analysis of atomi loalization in optial potential based on a full quantum

approah for atomi density matrix. We also show that the laser ooling in a deep far-o(cid:27) detuned

optial potential, reated by a light (cid:28)eld with a polarization gradient, an be used as an alternative

method for forming high ontrast spatially loalized strutures of atoms for the purposes of atom

lithography and atomi nanofabriation. Finally, we perform an analysis of the possible limits for

the width and the ontrast of loalized atomi strutures that an in priniple be reahed by this

type of the light mask.

The harateristi time when the dissipation proesses

the general master equation (4) is valid for the lowest

vibrational energy levels when the the energy separation

between different bands are muh greater than the ef-

fetive width due to optial width and tunneling effets.

This ondition implies very large detuning. However, the

density of energy states inreases for the upper energy

levels and the energy differene between adjaent states

ould be very small [13℄. This irumstanes therefore

make very hard to use the seular approximation for de-

Fig. 2 the differenes between the urves beome more

signifiant with the optial potential depth U0 inreas-

ing, orresponding to out of framework from seular ap-

proah. The width of the loalized strutures and the

ontrast tends to an asymptoti onstant value with in-

reasing of the light field intensity, however that depends

on light field detuning. In order to find the asymptoti

values for the width we fit urves with an empirial low

w(x) = a+b/√1 + c x. The results for asymptoti values
a are shown in Fig. 3.

We performed the fully quantum analysis of atomi

loalization obtained by laser ooling in nonuniformly

polarized low-intensity light field. Generally, onditions

 

for a deep laser ooling mismath onditions for strong

atomi loalization that require deeper optial potential

and onsequently leads to higher laser ooling tempera-

ture. Additionally, in a deep optial potential the seular

approximation (1) restrited by relation on light field de-

tuning and the depth of optial potential. In our treat-

ment we had no suh limitation allowing a more or-

retly desribe the spatial solution for atomi distribution

funtion inluding loalized and above-barrier motioned

atoms. The stationary solution of atoms is a funtion

of the light field detuning δ and the dimensionless pa-
rameter µ (15). We analyzed the width and ontrast

of loalized atomi strutures as a funtion of these pa-

rameters. We showed that the atomi struture width

and ontrast have a strong dependene on µ and tend to

onstant values with an inreasing optial potential dept

that depends on the light field detuning.

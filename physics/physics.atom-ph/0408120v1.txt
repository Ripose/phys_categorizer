Abstract

The static and dynamic properties of the alkaline-earth atoms in their metastable state are

computed in a conﬁguration interaction approach with a semi-empirical model potential for the

core. Among the properties determined are the scalar and tensor polarizabilities, the quadrupole

moment, some of the oscillator strengths and the dispersion coeﬃcients of the van der Waals

interaction. A simple method for including the eﬀect of the core on the dispersion parameters is

described.

INTRODUCTION

The low-lying triplet metastable states of alkaline-earth atoms have been generating in-

creasing interest in the area of cold-atom physics for a number of reasons. One application

0 → 3P o

is to use the 1Se

use of the 1Se

1 transition in calcium as a new optical frequency standard [1]. The
0 transitions for fermionic 87Sr stored in an optical lattice is expected
to further result in an improved standard [2]. Another possible application is in the forma-

0 → 3P o

tion of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) consisting of alkaline-earth atoms [3, 4] in their

metastable triplet states. The stability, size and excitation modes of BECs depends on the

sign (and magnitude) of the scattering length, and the scattering length depends sensitively

on the precise values of the dispersion constants [5, 6].

Taken in conjunction, the desirability of obtaining precise values of the static and dynamic

properties of the low-lying nsnp 3P o metastable state has greatly increased in importance.

In this article, properties of these states are computed from valence electron conﬁguration in-

teraction calculations that use a semi-empirical model potential to describe the core-valence

interaction [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Among the data computed are the oscillator strengths for some

of the low-lying transitions, the scalar and tensor polarizabilities, the quadrupole moments,

and the dispersion coeﬃcients for the van der Waals interaction between two atoms.

II. RESULTS OF THE CALCULATIONS

A. Methodology

The properties of these states are computed using conﬁguration interaction (CI) calcula-

tions that treat the correlations between the valence particles in an ab-initio manner while us-

ing a semi-empirical model potential to describe the core-valence interaction [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

The details of this calculation are very similar to those reported in [9, 11, 12] apart from

some minor changes in the cutoﬀ parameters and the use of an orbital basis of larger dimen-

sion. The polarization potentials were initially deﬁned by tuning the potential to reproduce

the ns, np, nd and nf binding energies of the respective singly ionized atom. The Hamil-

tonian was then diagonalized in a basis consisting of all the two-electron basis states that

could be formed from a set of about 140-150 single particle orbitals. The basis set contained

orbitals up to and including ℓ ≤ 8 and the two-electron basis dimensions ranged from 1000

2

to 4000. For all practical purposes the basis for the two-valence electrons can be regarded as

saturated. The initial binding energies obtained by this procedure were not in perfect agree-

ment with experiment with discrepancies for the ground and excited state energies of the

order of 0.1-2.0% (refer to [9, 12] to get an indication of the accuracy). Some further tuning

of the cutoﬀ parameters was done to improve the accuracy of the energy diﬀerences which

directly impact on the accuracy of expectation values. Expectation values for multipole

operators were computed with a modiﬁed operator that allowed for polarization corrections

[11, 13, 14].

The model potential is quite realistic since the direct and exchange interactions with

the core were computed without approximation from a Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function,

only the core polarization potential was described with a model potential. The resulting

polarizabilities, and dispersion parameters for homo-nuclear pairs of atoms were generally

within 0.1% of the best variational calculations for Li or Be, and for heavier atoms they were

generally within 1-2% of results coming from large fully relativistic calculations combining

conﬁguration interaction and many-body perturbation theory techniques [11].

The most likely source of error in the present calculations for the heavier species, Ca and

Sr, is the neglect of relativistic eﬀects. However, the use of a polarization potential tuned to

the experimental binding energy will implicitly take into account the inﬂuence of relativistic

eﬀects upon the core electron distribution. Further, Greene and Aymar have shown that

the spin-orbit interaction does not have major eﬀect on the structure of the alkaline-earth

wave functions [15].

B. Energy levels

The energy levels of the present calculations are given in Table I and compared with ex-

periment. The polarization cut-oﬀ parameters were ﬁne-tuned to reproduce the experimental

binding energy of the lowest states of each symmetry. In the case for states with L > 0

the parameters were tuned to reproduce the center-of-gravity of the spin-orbit triplets. The

spin-orbit splitting of the triplet states is largest for strontium and its magnitude is about

0.001 Hartree.

The agreement between the theoretical and experimental energy levels is suﬃciently close

to discount the possibility that energy level considerations might make a signiﬁcant contri-

3

bution to the uncertainty in the oscillator strengths and polarizabilities.

TABLE I: Theoretical and experimental energy levels (in Hartree) of some of the low-lying

metastable states of the alkaline-earth atoms. The energies are given relative to the energy of

the doubly ionized core. The experimental energies for the triplet states are averages with the

usual (2J + 1) weighting factors. The experimental data are taken from [16, 17]. The md level is

the 3d level for Be, Mg and Ca while for Sr it is the 4d level.

C. Quadrupole moments

The quadrupole moment of the 3P o

2 state is a static property of the state. An exact

knowledge of its value is important since the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction has a big

impact of the cold collision physics in metastable alkaline-earth metal atoms [4, 18]. Deﬁning

the LS coupled reduced matrix element as

Q(L) = hΨ(3P o) k

i C2(ri) k Ψ(3P o)i ,
r2

the quadrupole moment for a triplet state is usually deﬁned as the moment of 3P 0

J state

with MJ = J; In the expression above C2(ˆr) is the spherical tensor of rank 2.

Q = hΨ(3P o

J ); MJ = J|

i C 2
r2

0 (ri)|Ψ(3P o

J ); MJ = Ji ,

(2)

This can be written [19]

where the Wigner-Eckart theorem has been used twice to collapse the angular factors. The

quadrupole moment for a 3P level is often given for the J = 2 state. The quadrupole moment

Q(LJ) for the J = 2 state is equal to 2hQzzi.

Some older calculations of hQzzi exist [20, 21]. The ﬁnite element Multi Conﬁguration

Hartree-Fock (MCHF) calculation of Sundholm and Olsen for Be gave 4.53 au which is in

excellent agreement with the present value of 4.54 au. The CI calculations of Ceraulo and

Berry [20] consistently underestimated the present quadrupole moments (e.g. 7.944 au for

Mg) and are not listed in Table II.

The quadrupole moments are compared with the recent calculations by other groups in

Table II. The CI+MBPT calculation [4] is a fully relativistic calculation with the post-HF

interactions between the valence electrons and the core treated with perturbation theory

while the interaction between the two valence electrons are teated with the CI ansatz.

The calculation of Santra and Greene [22] (SG-CI) treated the two active electrons within

a CI framework while using a model potential to represent the core-valence interaction.

The model potential did include a spin-orbit interaction. One limitation with the SG-CI

calculation is that it does not include the di-electronic part of the polarization potential.

The noticeable feature of Table II is that all three calculations agree with other with a

total variation of less than 2%. The present results generally lie closer to the CI+MBPT

calculation than the SG-CI calculation. The high level of agreement between three com-

pletely independent calculations suggests that the uncertainty ascribed by Derevianko et al

to their quadrupole moment was too big by a factor of 2.

D. Oscillator strengths of low-lying transitions

The oscillator strengths for the transitions to the lowest lying 3Se, 3P e and 3De states are

given in Table II. The absorption oscillator strength from state ψ0 is calculated according

to the identity

2|hψ0; L0S k

f0n =

i riC1(ˆri) k ψn; LnSi|2ǫ0n
3(2L0 + 1)

.

(4)

The oscillator strengths for the Be triplet transitions are probably as accurate as any that

have previously been published. The basis for the valence electrons is eﬀectively saturated

and the semi-empirical approach to core polarization is capable of high accuracy [11]. For

example, the present methodology reproduces the dipole and quadrupole polarizability of

Be given by a close to exact calculation [23] to an accuracy of 0.2%. The present oscillator

strengths agree very well with the experimental values given in Table II. Not shown in the

5

Table are the 3P o → 3P e oscillator strengths of CI calculation of Weiss [24] and the MCHF

calculation of Jonsson et al [25]. Both of these calculations were very large and incorporated

both core and valence excitations. The Weiss f -value was 0.447, while the Jonsson et al

result was 0.4463. These could hardly be any closer to the present value of 0.4467.

The present oscillator strength for the transition to the 3Se state in Mg, namely 0.138 is

in excellent agreement with that obtained from the low uncertainty experiment of Andra et

al [26], 0.139±0.003. Agreement with the large basis CI calculation of Moccia and Spizzo

(MS-CI) is also good [27]. The MS-CI calculation is similar to the present calculation in that

excitations are only permitted for the valence electrons. It does not allow for core-valence

correlations so the present approach, which does, should be regarded as being more reliable.

In the case of Ca, good agreement is achieved with the model potential calculations of

Hansen et al [28] for the transitions to the 3Se and 3P e states. A 7% discrepancy occurs for

the transition of the 4s3d 3De state. The larger diﬀerence here is expected since the 3d orbital

does have a tendency to penetrate into the core and therefore degrade the accuracy associated

with model potential methods. The best ab-initio calculation is the MCHF calculation by

Froese-Fischer and Tachiev [29]. The MCHF calculation allows for core-valence correlations

and also includes relativistic eﬀects using the Briet-Pauli Hamiltonian. The MCHF oscillator

strengths listed in Table II are a weighted average of the individual lines in the multiplet.

The largest diﬀerence between the present and MCHF oscillator strengths is less than 4%.

The multi-channel quantum defect theory (MQDT) calculations of Werji et al [30] which

use an R-matrix calculation to determine the short-range parameters. Their transition rate

data was converted to oscillator strengths using experimental energy diﬀerences and lie

within 2-3 % of the present oscillator strengths.

The most precise experiment for Sr is that of Andra et al [31] which gave a lifetime of

7.89 ± 0.05 ns for the 5p2 3P e

2 state. This state can decay to the both the 5s5p and 5s6p

levels and the lifetime was converted to an oscillator strength by neglecting the transition

to the 5s6p state. This assumption is justiﬁed since the dipole matrix element will be small

due to the h5p|6pi overlap, and the 5s6p2 3P o → 5p2 3P e energy diﬀerence of 0.0073 Hartree

is also small.

The comparison with the time-dependent gauge independent (TDGI) calculations of

Merewa et al [32] is mainly of interest because these authors also give estimates of the

scalar and tensor polarizabilities. A quick comparison of TDGI f -values with other results

6

in Table II reveals that their oscillator strengths do not have the same level of accuracy

as the other calculations. The underlying atomic structure information entering the TDGI

formalism comes from CI calculations.

E. The polarizabilities

1. Theoretical treatment of polarizabilities

This analysis is done under the premise that spin-orbit eﬀects are small and the radial

parts of the wave functions are the same for the states with diﬀerent J.

The Stark energy shifts for the diﬀerent L0 levels in an electric ﬁeld F are written as [49]

1
2
The Stark shifts for the diﬀerent M0 states of the 3P o level are diﬀerent and the polarizability

αL0M0F 2 .

∆E = −

(5)

is written as

αL0M0 = α0 +

3M 2

0 − L0(L0 + 1)
L0(2L0 − 1)

α2 .

where α2 is taken from the state with M0 = L0. The total polarizability is written in terms

of both a scalar and tensor polarizability. The scalar polarizability represents the average

shift of the diﬀerent M levels while the tensor polarizability gives the diﬀerential shift.

In terms of second order perturbation theory, the energy shift from an electric ﬁeld, F

pointing in the z-direction is

distribution for the core was estimated using a semi-empirical method [11]. In this approach

one writes

where Ni is the number of electrons in a core orbital, ǫi is the Koopman energy, and ∆ is an

energy shift parameter chosen so that eq. (10) reproduces an accurate estimate of the core

polarizability determined my other, independent means.

Since the M-dependent part of the polarizability is a tensor of rank 2 and it is easiest to

deﬁne it in terms of α2,L0L0.

α2,L0M0 = α2,L0L0 × (−1)L0−M0

The core does not make a contribution to the tensor polarizability since it has an equal

impact on all the diﬀerent M-levels.

The development above is for LS coupled states, but it is common to give the tensor

polarizability for LSJ states. These can be related to the LS states by geometric factors

arising from the application of Racah algebra. The polarizability can be expanded

αJ0M0 = α0 +

3M 2

0 − J0(J0 + 1)
J0(J0 − 1)

α2,J0J0 .

where α2,J0J0 is the tensor polarizability of the state with M0 = J0. The scalar polarizability

for the diﬀerent J levels are the same and equal to the scalar polarizability in the L repre-

sentation. The tensor polarizability between the L and J representations can be related by

When J = 1 this reduces to α2,J0J0 = −α2,L0L0/2. (This result has been checked by convert-

ing our LS coupled f -values into LSJ coupled values and then using the standard expression

in terms of the |hJ0 k r k Jni|2 matrix elements [49].)

2. Results of calculations

The program logic and associated numerics were initially tested by estimating the polar-

izabilities of the 1s2p 3P o level of He. The present α0 of 46.6 a3

0 is within 0.2% of the close to
exact calculation of Yan et al [35]. Agreement with the TDGI α2,L0L0 of Rerat and Pouchan

[36] is not as good, but it should be noted that the TDGI calculation calculation obtains an

α0 of 49.5 a3

0, indicating that the Rerat-Pouchan calculation is not quite converged.

The present estimates of the Be polarizabilities are the most accurate that have been

published. The agreement with the Themelis and Nicolaides MCHF calculation [37] for α0

is reasonable, but they give an α2,L0L0 that is about 20% smaller. This level of agreement
is acceptable given that the MCHF calculation was much smaller, the 2s2p 3P o state was

represented by a 3 conﬁguration MCHF wave function while 14 conﬁgurations were used to

represent the excited states.

Only a moderate level of agreement is achieved with the TDGI polarizabilities for Be,

Mg and Ca [38, 42, 45]. The static polarizabilities agree at the 10% level while the TDGI

estimates of the tensor polarizability are up to 50% diﬀerent. The lower level of accuracy

achieved by the TDGI calculations is consistent with the earlier discussion concerning the

accuracy of the oscillator strengths.

A recent measurement of the tensor polarizability for the 3P o

1 state of Ca using an atomic

polarization interferometer gave 2.623 ± 0.015 kHz/(kV/cm)2 or 10.54 ± 0.06 a3

0 [50]. The
tensor polarizability of the J = 1 state is determined from the Ca entry in Table II by

multiplying by - 1

2 according to eq. (16). The present calculation gives α2,J0J0 = 14.2 a3

0 for

the 3P o

1 state. A very early estimate of the tensor polarizability for this state was 12.9 ± 3.2

9

0 [51] and another independent experiment gave α2,J0J0 = 12.1 ± 0.8 a3
a3

0 [52].

The scaler polarizability of the 3P o state has not been measured directly, but there have

been measurements of the diﬀerence between the polarizabilities of the 4s2 1Se

0 ground state

and the 3P o

1 (m = 0) ground state. Morinaga et al [53] obtained 90.4 ± 13.5 a3

diﬀerence in the polarizabilities. Using the polarizability of 159.4 a3

0 for the
0 for the Ca ground state

[11], and the present 3P o

1 (m = 0) polarizability of 295.3 − 2 × 14.2 = 266.9 a3

0 gives 107.5

a3
0 for the diﬀerence in the polarizability.

The Stark frequency shift of Li and van Wijngaarden of 12.314 ± 0.041 kHz/(kV/cm)2.

1 (m = 0) transition [54] converts to a polarizability diﬀerence of

for the 4s2 1Se

0 → 3P o
98.98 ± 0.33 a3
0.

Taken together, present estimates of α2,J0J0 are larger than experiment by about 20%

while estimates of the α0(4s2 1Se) − α0(4s4p 3P o

1 ) polarizability diﬀerence are about 10%

too large. Rectifying the situation in a non-relativistic calculation could be problematic

since an improvement in α2,J0,J0 will result in the theoretical polarizability diﬀerence drifting

further away from the experimental polarizability diﬀerence.

The obvious improvement that could eliminate this problem would be the inclusion of

the spin-orbit interaction. The largest contribution to the polarizability comes from the

transitions to the 3De levels. The spin-orbit splitting leads to the excitation energies for

4s3d states with diﬀering J ﬂuctuating by about ±2%. Given the cancellations that occur

in the evaluation of eq. (13) it is possible that introduction of spin-orbit splitting could lead

to a Ca tensor polarizability in better agreement with experiment.

There have been no measurements of the tensor polarizability for the other alkaline-earth

atoms. This should be rectiﬁed since it would be a very useful diagnostic with which to

assess the accuracy of the structure models of the metastable states.

3. Alternate treatment of core

It is desirable to partition the core f -value some into contributions that arise from exci-

tations to ﬁnal states with diﬀerent core+valence angular momentum, LT . Therefore, it is

possible to write symbolically

αcore =

αcore,LT ,

(17)

LT
X

10

where αcore,LT will include all the contributions from the diﬀerent magnetic sub-levels, i.e.

αcore,LT =

αcore,LT MT .

MT
X

For any of the core dipole excited magnetic sub-levels one can write

αcore,LT MT =

f (00 : LM → n; LT MT )
ǫ2
0n

.

n
X
The ﬁnal states, |LT MT i can be expanded in terms of uncoupled states, e.g.

|LT MT i =

h1mLM|LT MT i|1mLMi ,

mM
X

where 1m refers to the angular momentum of the excited core and LM refers to the angular

momentum of the 3P o metastable state which is acting as a spectator. Therefore, it is

possible to decompose the oscillator strength as

f (0; 00LM → n; LT MT ) =

|h1mLM|LT MT i|LT MT i|2f (0; 00LM → n; 1mLM) .

(21)

mM
X

mM
X

The polarizability can also be expanded in terms of uncoupled states

αLT MT =

|h1mLM|LT MT i|LT MT i|2αcore,mM /(2L + 1) .

(22)

The factor of (2L+1) in the denominator arises due to the sum over spectator states. We now

assume that the excitations for the core occur independently of the state of valence electrons

which act as spectators. Therefore, the contribution to the polarizability is independent of

M. Further, the core initially has a net angular momentum of zero and therefore the

diﬀerent magnetic sub-levels of the core excitations should give equal contributions to the

polarizability, hence

The ﬁnal result is

αcore,mM =

αcore
3

.

αLT MT =

mM
X

|h1mLM|LT MT i|LT MT i|2 αcore

3(2L + 1)

which can be simpliﬁed by summing the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients to give

(18)

(19)

(20)

(23)

(24)

(25)

αcore,LT =

(2LT + 1)αcore
3(2L + 1)

.

11

When particular values are substituted into eq. (25) the distribution of the core f -value

sum into the 3So, 3P o and 3Do manifolds is given in the proportion 1

9. This is of
course just the statistical weighting associated with the (2LT + 1) degeneracy factor. It is

9 : 3

9 : 5

simple to verify that such a proportion means the net contribution of the core to the tensor

polarizability as deﬁned by eq. (14) is zero.

F. The van der Waals coeﬃcients

The van der Waals coeﬃcients given in Table II are those for a pair of 3P o

0 states. The

dispersion parameter, C6 is simple to compute since both of the atoms have a net angular

momentum of zero. The expression is

C6 =

3
2

f0,n1f0,n2
ǫ0n1ǫ0n2(ǫ0n1 + ǫ0n2)

.

n1,n2
X

(26)

The present dispersion parameters are slightly larger than those of the SG-CI calculation of

Santra and Greene [22]. Taking the case of Sr, the diﬀerence here is about 15%. About half

of this diﬀerence can be attributed to the core since C6 = 5668 au when core excitations are

omitted from eq.(26). So part of the discrepancy arises from the neglect of the core in the

SG-CI calculation. One cautionary note should be made. Santra and Greene reported C6 for
the 3P o

0 state is the most tightly bound state of the 5s5p multiplet one

0 state. Since the 3P o

expects the present LS coupled calculation to have a slightly larger C6. The quantitative

impact of spin-orbit splitting can best be determined by separate evaluations of C6 for the

J = 0, 1 and 2 states.

The van der Waals coeﬃcients that are relevant to BEC studies are those between two

3P o

2 states. The algebra related to this is somewhat messy and the coeﬃcients are presented
in the formalism of Santra and Greene [19, 22]. The intermediate dispersion coeﬃcient

between two 3P o

J states is deﬁned as

BJ1,J2 = (−1)J1−J2+1

f0,n1f0,n2
ǫ0n1ǫ0n2(ǫ0n1 + ǫ0n2)

,

n1,n2

(27)

where n1 has angular momentum J1 and n2 has angular momentum J2.

This LS coupled oscillator strengths were converted into the LSJ coupling scheme using

12

the identity

f (J0 → Jn) = f (L0 → Ln)(2L0 + 1)(2Jn + 1)

When the sum, eq. (27), was evaluated, the core f -value distribution was included using

The results of our calculations are presented in Table III and compared with earlier

CI+MBPT calculations of Derevianko et al [4] and the SG-CI calculations [22]. There is no

apparent experimental activity on the metastable states of Be and the present data in the

Table were only included for reasons of completeness.

The present calculation and the CI+MBPT calculation could hardly be in any better

agreement for magnesium. The largest disagreement for any of the BJ1,J2 coeﬃcients was

1.2% for the B2,2 coeﬃcient. Agreement with the SG-CI calculation is not as good with the

occasional discrepancy of 5% and it is noticeable that the present and CI+MBPT results do

tend to be larger in magnitude.

For calcium there is a tendency for the present results to be from 1% to 5% larger in

magnitude with the diﬀerences being smaller for the larger values of J1 and J2. The present

dispersion coeﬃcients all lie within the 10% uncertainty that Derevianko et al associate

with their results. Agreement with the SG-CI calculations is not so good with discrepancies

exceeding 10% being common.

The pattern for strontium is similar to that seen for calcium. The present BJ1,J2 coef-

ﬁcients are larger than the CI+MBPT data for B1,1 and smaller for B3,3. The diﬀerences

with the SG-CI calculation are generally larger than those with the CI+MBPT calculation.

Some general trends are noticeable. The SG-CI calculation always gave the smallest

result for B1,1, B2,1, B3,1, B3,2 and B3,3. Furthermore, the sum

Ji,Jj BJi,Jj for the present
calculations and CI+MBPT calculations are consistently bigger than the SG-CI calculations,

P

with the diﬀerence becoming larger as the atom gets heavier. This could be a manifestation

of the increasing importance of the core contribution to the BJi,Jj coeﬃcients as the atom

gets heavier.

It is also evident that some of the uncertainty estimates of the SG-CI calculation were

somewhat optimistic. For example, they give B1,1 = 139 ± 7 au for strontium. The contribu-

tion of the core f -value sum to this dispersion parameter is 12.0 au. So the core contribution,

13

which is not incorporated in the SG-CI calculation, is larger than their estimated uncertainty.

III. CONCLUSIONS

A systematic study of the properties of the alkaline-earth atoms reveals that the present

non-relativistic approach reproduces the results of the CI+MBPT ansatz of Derevianko et

al [4] to better than 5%. Agreement with the model potential CI calculation of Santra

and Greene [22] is not so good with discrepancies of 10-15% occuring for the spherical

part of the C6 dispersion coeﬃcient. Due to the unknown impact of the spin-orbit energy,

splitting upon the polarizabilities and dispersion coeﬃcients, it is not possible to make a

deﬁnitive statement about any reasons for the diﬀering levels of agreement with these two

other calculations. However, we do suspect that the omissions of the SG-CI model, i.e. the

di-electronic two body polarization potential, the non-usage of a dressed dipole transition

operator, and the lack of core excitation terms in the dispersion sum rules all contribute in

part to the diﬀerences with the SG-CI model.

It should be noted that previous studies with the present model for the alkali atoms and

singlet states of the alkaline atoms demonstrated that the method could predict a number of

expectation values with an overall accuracy of 1-2% or better [11]. The presence of spin-orbit

energy splitting, and the existence of a 3De state very close in energy to the 3P o metastable

level leads to a decrease in accuracy for atomic properties such as the tensor polarizability

that are sensitive to these energy diﬀerences. Additional high precision measurements of

the tensor polarizabilities for the Mg, Ca and Sr would be certainly be worthwhile since

the sensitivity of this parameter to the ﬁne details of the wave function should help in the

reﬁnement of the two-body potentials used to characterize ultra-cold collisions.

It is interesting to speculate whether the better agreement with the CI+MBPT cal-

culations could be achieved by incorporating a spin-orbit potential into the Hamiltonian

and using jj coupling. Alternatively, a fully relativistic treatment, using a relativistic HF

wave function might be necessary. Resolution of these questions requires that explicit cal-

culations be made to determine the additional physics needed to eliminate the anomalies

between the present calculations and experiment and between the present calculations and

the CI+MBPT calculations.

TABLE II: Properties of the metastable 3P o levels of the alkaline-earth atoms and He (note, the

lowest 3P o level is not metastable in He). The oscillator strengths to the lowest 3Se, 3P e and

3De states are given as f (3Le). The scalar and tensor dipole polarizabilities are α0 and α2,L0L0

respectively. The quadrupole moment Q is given for the 3P o

2 state while the dispersion parameter

C6 is that for two 3P o

0 states. The He ”Other Theory” row reports the results of close to exact
calculations with the exception of α2,L0L0. The present oscillator strength to the He 3De state is

not to a physical state, rather it is to the lowest energy pseudo-state. All quantities are in atomic

units and the numbers in brackets are the uncertainties in the last digits.

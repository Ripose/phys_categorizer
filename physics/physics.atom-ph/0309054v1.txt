Abstract

High-precision measurements of violations of fundamental symmetries in
atoms are a very eﬀective means of testing the standard model of elementary
particles and searching for new physics beyond it. Such studies complement
measurements at high energies. We review the recent progress in atomic parity
nonconservation and atomic electric dipole moments (time reversal symmetry
violation), with a particular focus on the atomic theory required to interpret
the measurements.

processes covering a range in momentum transfer exceeding ten orders of magnitude.
It
correctly predicted the existence of new particles such as the neutral Z boson. However, the
standard model fails to provide a deep explanation for the physics that it describes. For
example, why are there three generations of fermions? What determines their masses and
the masses of gauge bosons? What is the origin of CP violation? The Higgs boson (which
gives masses to the particles in the standard model) has not yet been found. The standard
model is unable to explain Big Bang baryogenesis which is believed to arise as a consequence
of CP violation.

It is widely believed that the standard model is a low-energy manifestation of a more
complete theory (perhaps one that uniﬁes the four forces). Many well-motivated extensions
to the standard model have been proposed, such as supersymmetric, technicolor, and left-
right symmetric models, and these give predictions for physical phenomena that diﬀer from
those of the standard model.

Some searches for new physics beyond the standard model are performed at high-energy
and medium-energy particle colliders where new processes or particles would be seen directly.
However, a very sensitive probe can be carried out at low energies through precision studies
of quantities that can be described by the standard model. The new physics is manifested
indirectly through a deviation of the measured values from the standard model predictions.
The atomic physics tests that are the subject of this review lie in this second category. These
tests exploit the fact that low-energy phenomena are especially sensitive to new physics that
is manifested in the violations of fundamental symmetries, in particular P (parity) and T
(time-reversal), that occur in the weak interaction. The deviations from the standard model,
or the eﬀects themselves, may be very small. To this end, exquisitely precise measurements
and calculations are required.

More than twenty years ago atomic experiments played an important role in the veriﬁ-
cation of the standard model. While the ﬁrst evidence for neutral weak currents (existence
of the neutral Z boson) was discovered in neutrino scattering [2], the fact that neutral cur-
rents violate parity was ﬁrst established in atomic experiments [3] and only later observed in
high-energy electron scattering [4]. Now atomic physics plays a major role in the search for
possible physics beyond the standard model. Precision atomic and high-energy experiments
have diﬀerent sensitivities to models of new physics and so they provide complementary
tests. In fact the energies probed in atomic measurements exceed those currently accessible
at high-energy facilities. For example, the most precise measurement of parity nonconser-
vation (PNC) in the cesium atom sets a lower bound on an extra Z boson popular in many
extensions of the standard model that is tighter than the bound set directly at the Teva-
tron (see Section V). Also, the null measurements of electric dipole moments (EDMs) in
atoms (an EDM is a P - and T -violating quantity) place severe restrictions on new sources
of CP -violation which arise naturally in models beyond the standard model such as super-
symmetry. (Assuming CPT invariance, CP -violation is accompanied by T -violation.) Such
limits on new physics have not been set by the detection of CP-violation in the neutral K
[5] and B [6] mesons (see, e.g., Ref. [7] for a review of CP violation in these systems).

5

Let us note that while new physics would bring a relatively small correction to a very
small signal in atomic parity violation, in atomic EDMs the standard model value is sup-
pressed and is many orders of magnitude below the value expected from new theories. There-
fore, detection of an EDM would be unambiguous evidence of new physics.

This review is motivated by the great progress that has been made recently in both
the measurements and calculations of violations of fundamental symmetries in atoms. This
includes the discovery of the nuclear anapole moment (an electromagnetic multipole that
violates parity) [8], the measurement of the parity violating electron-nucleon interaction in
cesium to 0.35% accuracy [8], the improvement in the accuracy (to 0.5%) of the atomic
theory required to interpret the cesium measurement [9], and greatly improved limits on the
atomic [10] and electron [11] electric dipole moments.

The aim of this review is to describe the theory of parity and time-reversal violation in
atoms and explain how atomic experiments are used to test the standard model of elementary
particles and search for new physics beyond it. We track the recent progress in the ﬁeld.
In particular, we clarify the situation in atomic parity violation in cesium: it is now ﬁrmly
established that the cesium measurement [8] is in excellent agreement with the standard
model; see Section V.

The structure of the review is the following. Broadly, it is divided into two parts. The
ﬁrst part, Section II to Section VII, is devoted to parity violation in atoms. The second
part, Section VIII to Section X, is concerned with atomic electric dipole moments.

In Section II the sources of parity violation, and the standard model predictions, are
In Section III a summary of the measurements of parity violation in atoms

is given, with particular emphasis on the measurements with cesium. Also the atomic
calculations are summarized. In Section IV we present a detailed description of the methods
for high-precision atomic structure calculations applicable to atoms with a single valence
electron. The methods are applied to parity violation in cesium in Section V and the value
for the weak nuclear charge is extracted and compared with the standard model prediction.
A discussion of the new physics constraints is also presented. In Section VI a brief description
for the method of atomic structure calculations for atoms with more than one valence electron
is given, and the thallium PNC work is discussed. A brief discussion of the prospects for
measuring PNC along a chain of isotopes is also presented. Then in Section VII work on
the anapole moment is reviewed.

A description of electric dipole moments in atoms is given in Section VIII, with a sum-
mary of all the measurements and a discussion of the P, T -violating sources at diﬀerent
energy scales. Then in Section IX a review of P, T -violating nuclear moments is given. In
Section X a summary of the best limits on P, T -violating parameters can be found.

Concluding remarks are presented in Section XI.
For a general introduction to atomic P -violation and P, T -violation we refer the reader

to the excellent books by Khriplovich [12] and Khriplovich and Lamoreaux [13].

II. MANIFESTATIONS AND SOURCES OF PARITY VIOLATION IN ATOMS

Parity nonconservation (PNC) in atoms arises largely due to the exchange of Z 0-bosons
between atomic electrons and the nucleus. The weak electron-nucleus interaction violating

parity, but conserving time-reversal, is given by the following product of axial vector (A)
and vector (V) currents:

The nuclear weak charge QW is protected from strong-interaction eﬀects by conservation
of the nuclear vector current. The clean extraction of the weak couplings of the quarks
from atomic measurements makes this a powerful method of testing the standard model and
searching for new physics beyond it.

The nuclear spin independent eﬀects arising from the nuclear weak charge give the largest
contribution to parity violation in heavy atoms compared to other mechanisms. However,
note that the weak interaction (5) does not always “work”. This interaction can only mix
states with the same electron angular momentum (it is a scalar). Nuclear spin-dependent
mechanisms (see below), which produce much smaller eﬀects in atoms, can change electron
angular momentum and so can contribute exclusively to certain transitions in atoms and
dominate parity violation in molecules.

2. Nuclear spin-dependent contributions to atomic parity violation; the nuclear anapole moment

Using the non-relativistic approximation for the nucleons, the nuclear spin-dependent

interaction due to neutral weak currents is (see, e.g., [12])

where αi = γ0γi. This term arises from the space-like component of the (Ve, AN ) coupling.
Averaging this interaction over the nuclear state with angular momentum I in the single-
particle approximation gives

C2. There are two reasons for the suppression
of this contribution to parity violating eﬀects in atoms. First, unlike the spin-independent
eﬀects [Eq. (5)], the nucleons do not contribute coherently; in the nuclear shell model only
the unpaired nucleon which carries nuclear spin I makes a contribution. Second, the factor

There is another contribution to nuclear spin-dependent PNC in atoms arising from
neutral currents: the “usual” weak interaction due to the nuclear weak charge, ˆhW , perturbed
by the hyperﬁne interaction [18]. In the single-particle approximation this interaction can

However, the neutral currents are not the dominant source of parity violating spin-
dependent eﬀects in heavy atoms. It is the nuclear anapole moment κa that gives the largest
eﬀects [20]. This moment arises due to parity violation inside the nucleus, and manifests
itself in atoms through the usual electromagnetic interaction with atomic electrons. The

The spin-dependent contributions [Eqs. (9,10,12)] have the same form and produce the
same eﬀects in atoms. We will continue our discussion of the nuclear anapole moment and
of nuclear spin-dependent eﬀects in atoms in Section VII.

A. Simple calculation of the weak interaction in atoms induced by the nuclear weak
charge; the Z 3 enhancement

In 1974 the Bouchiats showed that parity violating eﬀects in atoms increase with the
nuclear charge Z faster than Z 3 [14,22]. This result was the incentive for studies of parity
violation in heavy atoms.

Let us brieﬂy point out where the factor of Z 3 originates. Taking the non-relativistic
limit of the electron wave functions and considering the approximation of inﬁnite boson
exchange mass, the Hamiltonian (5) reduces to

ˆhW =

where m, σ, p are the electron mass, spin, and momentum. The weak Hamiltonian ˆhW mixes
electron states of opposite parity and the same angular momentum (it is a scalar). It is a
local operator, so we need only consider the mixing of s and p1/2 states. The matrix element
, with non-relativistic single-particle s and p1/2 electron states, is proportional

to Z 2QW . One factor of Z here comes from the probability for the valence electron to be

III. MEASUREMENTS AND CALCULATIONS OF PARITY VIOLATION IN
ATOMS

An account of the dramatic story of the search for parity violation in atoms can be
found in the book [12]. Below we will brieﬂy discuss how parity violation in atoms is mani-
fested, which experiments have yielded non-zero signals of parity violation, what quantity is
measured in the atomic experiments, and what is required to interpret the measurements.
Parity violation in atoms produces a spin helix, and this helix interacts diﬀerently with
right- and left-polarized light (see, e.g., Ref. [12]). The polarization plane of linearly polar-
ized light will therefore be rotated in passing through an atomic vapour.

may appear that it is more rewarding to study M1 transitions that are highly forbidden,
where there is a larger rotation angle, the ordinary M1 transitions are in fact more convenient

In measurements of parity violation in highly-forbidden M1 transitions, an electric ﬁeld
ε is applied to open up the forbidden transition. The M1 transition then contains a Stark-
induced E1 component EStark which the parity violating amplitude interferes with. In such
experiments the ratio Im(EP N C)/β is measured, where β is the vector transition polarizabil-
ity, EStark ∼

the nuclear weak charge QW . Interpretation of the measurements in terms of the P -odd
parameters also requires a determination of M1 or β.

A. Summary of measurements

Zel’dovich was the ﬁrst to propose optical rotation experiments in atoms [23]. Unfortu-
nately, he only considered hydrogen where PNC eﬀects are small. Optical rotation experi-
ments in Tl, Pb, and Bi were proposed by Khriplovich [24], Sandars [25], and Sorede and
Fortson [26]. These proposals followed those by the Bouchiats to measure PNC in highly
forbidden transitions in Cs and Tl [22,14].

10

The ﬁrst signal of parity violation in atoms was seen in 1978 at Novosibirsk in an optical
rotation experiment with bismuth [3]. Now atomic PNC has been measured in bismuth, lead,
thallium, and cesium. PNC eﬀects were measured by optical rotation in the following atoms
6s26p3 2D5/2 by the Novosibirsk [3],
and transitions: in 209Bi in the transition 6s26p3 4S3/2 −
Moscow [27], and Oxford [28,29] groups and in the transition 6s26p3 4S3/2 −
6s26p3 2D3/2
6s26p2 3P1 in 208Pb at Seattle
by the Seattle [30] and Oxford [31,32] groups; in 6s26p2 3P0 −
6s26p 2P3/2 in natural Tl (70.5%
[33,34] and Oxford [35]; and in the transition 6s26p 2P1/2 −
205Tl and 29.5% 203Tl) at Oxford [36,37] and Seattle [38]. The highest accuracy that has
2 D3/2 [32],
been reached in each case is: 9% for 209Bi 4S3/2 −
1% for 208Pb [34], and 1% for Tl [38] .

2 D5/2 [29], 2% for 209Bi 4S3/2 −

The Stark-PNC interference method was used to measure PNC in the highly-forbidden
7s 2S1/2 in 133Cs at Paris [39–42] and Boulder [43,44,8] and
M1 transitions: 6s 2S1/2 −
6s27p 2P1/2 in 203,205Tl at Berkeley [45,46]. In the most precise Tl Stark-PNC
6s26p 2P1/2 −
experiment [46] an accuracy of 20% was reached. In 1997, PNC in Cs was measured with
an accuracy of 0.35% [8] – an accuracy unprecedented in measurements of PNC in atoms.

Results of atomic PNC measurements accurate to sub-5% are listed in Table I.
Several PNC experiments in rare-earth atoms have been prompted by the possibility of
enhancement of the PNC eﬀects due to the presence of anomously close levels of opposite
parity [47]. Another attractive feature of rare earth atoms is their abundance of stable
isotopes. Taking ratios of measurements of PNC in diﬀerent isotopes of the same element
removes from the interpretation the dependence on atomic theory [47]; see Section VI. Null
measurements of PNC have been reported for M1 transitions in the ground state conﬁgu-
ration 4f 66s2 of samarium at Oxford [48,49] and for the 4f 106s2 J = 8
4f 105d6s J = 10
transition in dysprosium at Berkeley [50]. The upper limits were smaller than expected by
theory.

review of the early measurements, see, e.g., [52]. For comprehensive reviews, please see the
book [12] and the more recent review [53].

B. Summary of calculations

The interpretation of the PNC measurements is limited by atomic structure calculations.
The theoretical uncertainty for thallium is at the level of 2.5-3% for the transition 6P1/2 −
7P1/2 at 6% [54] and for lead (8%) [56]
6P3/2 [54,55], and is worse for the transition 6P1/2 −
and bismuth (12% for the 876 nm transition 4S3/2 −
2D3/2 and about 70% for the 648 nm
2D5/2) [56,57]. The sizeable error in the calculation for the Bi 648 nm
transition 4S3/2 −
transition arises because there is a strong cancellation of the zeroth order contribution by the
ﬁrst-order correlation corrections, with the amplitude then being comprised largely of the
contributions of higher-order correlations [56,57]. Cesium is the simplest atom of interest
in PNC experiments, it has one electron above compact, closed shells. The precision of
the atomic calculations for Cs is 0.5% [9] (see also calculations accurate to better than 1%,
[57,16,58]). For references to earlier calculations for the above atoms and transitions, see,
e.g., the book [12].

In Table II we present the values of the most precise calculations for the PNC amplitudes
corresponding to those atoms and transitions in which high-precision measurements (< 5%

11

error) have been performed (Table I).

C. Cesium

Because of the extraordinary precision that has been achieved in measurements of cesium,
and the clean interpretation of the measurements (compared to other heavy atoms), in this
review we concentrate mainly on parity violation in cesium. The high precision of the
nuclear weak charge extracted from cesium has made this system important in low-energy
tests of the standard model and has made it one of the most sensitive probes of new physics.
Measurements of parity violation in cesium have also opened up a new window from which
parity violation within the nucleus (the nuclear anapole moment; see Section VII) can be
studied.

Below we list the measurements and calculations for cesium that have been performed

over the years, culminating in a 0.35% measurement and 0.5% calculation.

1. Measurements

Measurements of parity violation in the highly forbidden 6S

7S transition in Cs were
ﬁrst suggested and considered in detail in the landmark works of the Bouchiats [14,22]. Mea-
surements have been performed independently by the Paris group [39–42] and the Boulder
group [43,44,8]. The results of the Cs PNC experiments are summarized in Table III.

−

The Paris result in the ﬁrst row is the average [41] of their (revised) results for the
7SF =4 [40]. (The
measurements of PNC in the transitions 6SF =4 −
nuclear angular momentum of 133Cs I = 7/2 and the electron angular momentum J = 1/2,
so the total angular momentum of the atom is F = 3, 4). The Paris group have very recently
performed a new measurement of PNC in Cs (last row) using a novel approach, chiral optical
gain [42].

7SF =4 [39] and 6SF =3 −

Each of the Boulder results [43,44,8] cited in the table is an average of PNC in the
7SF =4. The accuracy of the latest result
hyperﬁne transitions 6SF =4 −
is 0.35%, several times more precise than the best measurements of parity violation in other
atoms.

7SF =3 and 6SF =3 −

The PNC nuclear spin-independent component, arising from the nuclear weak charge,
makes the same contribution to all hyperﬁne transitions. So averaging the PNC amplitudes
over the hyperﬁne transitions gives the contribution from the nuclear weak charge.

PNC in atoms dependent on the nuclear spin was detected for the ﬁrst (and only) time
in Ref. [8] where it appeared as a diﬀerence in the PNC amplitude in diﬀerent hyperﬁne
transitions. The dominant mechanism for nuclear spin dependent eﬀects in atoms, the
nuclear anapole moment, is the subject of Section VII.

Numerous calculations of the Cs 6S

7S EP N C amplitude have been performed over the
years. These calculations are summarized in Table IV. The many-body calculations [57,16],
accurate to 1%, performed more than ten years ago represented a signiﬁcant step forward

−

2. Calculations

12

for atomic many-body theory and parity violation in atoms. At the time, these calculations
were unmatched by the PNC measurements which were accurate to 2%. The method of
calculation used in Ref. [57] is the subject of Sections IV,V. The method used in Ref. [16]
is based on the popular coupled-cluster method, and we refer the interested reader to this
work for details.

In the last ten years a series of new measurements have been performed for quantities
used to test the accuracy of the atomic calculations [57,16], such as electric dipole transition
amplitudes (see [77]). The new measurements are in agreement with the calculations, re-
solving a previous discrepancy between theory and experiment. This inspired Bennett and
Wieman [77] to claim that the atomic theory is accurate to 0.4% rather than 1% claimed
by theorists. Since then, a number of previously unaccounted for contributions to the PNC
amplitude have been discovered, the Breit interaction and more recently the strong-ﬁeld
radiative corrections, that enter above the 0.4% level, but below 1% (see Section V).

A re-calculation of the work [57], with some further improvements, was performed re-
cently, with a full analysis of the accuracy of the PNC amplitude. This work, Ref. [9],
represents the most accurate (0.5%) calculation to date. It is described in detail in Section
V.

The result of [9] diﬀers from [57,16] by only

0.1% if Breit, vacuum polarization,
and neutron distribution corrections are excluded. One may interpret this as grounds for
asserting that the many-body calculations [57,16,58,9] have an accuracy of 0.5% in agreement
with the conclusion of [77].

IV. METHOD FOR HIGH-PRECISION ATOMIC STRUCTURE
CALCULATIONS IN HEAVY ALKALI-METAL ATOMS

In this section we describe methods that can be used to obtain high accuracy in calcula-
tions involving many-electron atoms with a single valence electron. These are the methods
that have been used to obtain the most precise calculation of parity nonconservation in Cs.
They were originally developed in works [65,78,79,54] and applied to the calculation of PNC
in Cs in Ref. [57]. In [57] it was claimed that the atomic theory is accurate to 1%. A com-
plete re-calculation of PNC in Cs using this method, with a new analysis of the accuracy,
indicates that the error is as small as 0.5% [9]. (We refer the reader to Section V, where
this question of accuracy is discussed in general; please also see Section V for an in-depth
discussion of PNC in Cs.)

In this section the method is applied to energies, electric dipole (E1) transition am-
plitudes, and hyperﬁne structure (hfs). A comparison of the calculated and experimental
values gives an indication of the quality of the many-body wave functions. Note that the
above quantities are sensitive to the wave functions at diﬀerent distances from the nucleus.
Hyperﬁne structure, energies, and E1 amplitudes are dominated by the contribution of the
wave functions at small, intermediate, and large distances from the nucleus. We concentrate
on calculations for Cs relevant to the 6S
7S PNC E1 amplitude (see Eq. (56) and Section
V A 5).

−

A brief overview of the method is presented in Section IV A. For those not interested in
the technical details of the atomic structure calculations, Sections IV B-IV H may be omitted
without loss of consistency.

A. Overview

The calculations begin in the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approximation. The N
1
−
self-consistent RHF orbitals of the core are found (N is the total number of electrons in the
atom), and the external electron is solved in the potential of the core electrons (the ˆV N
1
−
potential). RHF wave functions, energies, and Green’s functions are obtained in this way.

Correlation corrections to the external electron orbitals are included in second (low-
1), where ˆVexact is the exact Coulomb
est) order in the residual interaction ( ˆVexact −
interaction between the atomic electrons. The correlations are included into the external
electron orbitals by adding the correlation potential (the self-energy operator) to the RHF
potential when solving for the external electron. Using the Feynman diagram technique,
important higher-order diagrams are included into the self-energy in all orders: screening of
the electron-electron interaction and the hole-particle interaction. The self-energy is then
iterated using the correlation potential method.

ˆV N

−

Interactions of the atomic electrons with external ﬁelds are calculated using the time-
dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method; this method is equivalent to the random-phase
approximation (RPA) with exchange. Using this approach we can take into account the
polarization of the atomic core by external ﬁelds to all orders. Then the major correla-
tion corrections are included as corrections to electron orbitals (Brueckner orbitals). Small
correlation corrections (structural radiation, normalization) are taken into account using
many-body perturbation theory.

Here p is the electron momentum, α and β are Dirac matrices, Ze is the nuclear charge
and N is the number of electrons in the atom (N = 55 for cesium). This equation cannot
be solved exactly, so some approximation scheme must be used. This is done by excluding
the complicated Coulomb term and adding instead some averaged potential in which the
electrons move. The Coulomb term, minus the averaged potential, can be added back into
the equation perturbatively.

It is well known that choosing the electrons to move in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock
potential ˆV N
1, in the zeroth order approximation, simpliﬁes the calculations of higher-order
terms (we will come to this in the next section). The single-particle relativistic Hartree-Fock

a complete orthogonal set of single-particle orbitals for the core and valence electrons [80].
Because we are performing calculations for heavy atoms, and we are interested in inter-
actions that take place in the vicinity of the nucleus (the weak and hyperﬁne interactions),
the ﬁnite size of the nucleus needs to be taken into account. We use the standard formula
for the charge distribution in the nucleus

In order to obtain more realistic wave functions, we need to take into account the eﬀect
of correlations between the external electron and the core. We describe the techniques used
to calculate these correlations in the following sections.

C. Correlation corrections and many-body perturbation theory

The subject of this section is the inclusion of electron-electron correlations into the
single-particle electron orbitals using many-body perturbation theory. We will see that high
accuracy can be reached in the calculations by using the Feynman diagram technique as a
means of including dominating classes of diagrams in all orders.

The correlation corrections can be most accurately calculated in the case of alkali-metal
atoms (for example, cesium). This is because the external electron has very little overlap

15

with the electrons of the tightly bound core, enabling the use of perturbation theory in the
calculation of the residual interaction of the external electron with the core.

The exact Hamiltonian of an atom [Eq. (15)] can be divided into two parts: the ﬁrst part
is the sum of the single-particle Hamiltonians, and the second part represents the residual
Coulomb interaction

Correlation corrections to the single-particle orbitals are included perturbatively in the resid-
ual interaction ˆU . By calculating the wave functions in the Hartree-Fock potential ˆV N
1 for
the zeroth-order approximation, the perturbation corrections are simpliﬁed. The ﬁrst-order
corrections (in the residual Coulomb interaction ˆU) to the ionization energy vanish, since
the diagrams in ﬁrst-order in the Coulomb interaction are nothing but the Hartree-Fock ones
(Fig. 1). So two terms in Eq. (22) cancel each other. The lowest-order corrections therefore
correspond to those arising in second-order perturbation theory, ˆU (2). These corrections
are determined by the four Goldstone diagrams in Fig. 2 [80]. They can be calculated by
direct summation over intermediate states [80] or by the “correlation potential” method
[65]. This latter method gives higher accuracy and, along with the Feynman diagram tech-
nique to be discussed in the following section, enables the inclusion of higher-order eﬀects:
electron-electron screening, the hole-particle interaction, and the nonlinear contributions of
the correlation potential.

−

The correlation potential method corresponds to adding a nonlocal correlation potential
ˆΣ to the potential ˆV N
1 in the RHF equation (16) and then solving for the states of the
external electron. The correlation potential is deﬁned such that its average value coincides
with the correlation correction to the energy,

Note that ˆΣ is a single-electron and energy-dependent operator. By solving the RHF equa-

orbitals and energies.3 The largest correlation corrections are included in the Brueckner
orbitals.

3Note that there is a slight distinction in the deﬁnition of these Brueckner orbitals and those
deﬁned in, e.g., [83].

See Table V for Brueckner energies of the lower states of cesium calculated in the secon-
order correlation potential. ˆΣ(2)
ˆU (2) denotes the “pure” second-order correlation po-
tential (without screening, etc.). It is seen that the inclusion of these corrections improves
the energies signiﬁcantly, from the level of 10% deviation from experiment for the RHF
approximation to the level of 1%.

≡

D. All-orders summation of dominating diagrams

We saw in the previous section that when we take into account second-order correlation
corrections, the accuracy for energies is improved signiﬁcantly beyond that for energies
calculated in the RHF approximation. However, the corrections are overestimated. This
overestimation is largely due to the neglect of screening in the electron-electron interaction.
In this section we describe the calculations of three series of higher-order diagrams:
screening of the electron-electron interaction and the hole-particle interaction, which are
inserted into the correlation potential ˆΣ; and iterations of ˆΣ. With the inclusion of these
diagrams the accuracy for energies is improved to the level of 0.1% (see Table V).

The screening of the electron-electron interaction is a collective phenomenon and is sim-
ilar to Debye screening in a plasma; the corresponding chain of diagrams is enhanced by a
factor approximately equal to the number of electrons in the external closed subshell (the 5p
electrons in cesium) [78]. The importance of this eﬀect can be understood by looking at a
not dissimilar example in which screening eﬀects are important, for instance, the screening
of an external electric ﬁeld in an atom. According to the Schiﬀ theorem [84], a homogeneous
electric ﬁeld is screened by atomic electrons (and at the nucleus it is zero). (See [85] where
a numerical calculation of an external electric ﬁeld inside the atom has been performed.)

The hole-particle interaction is enhanced by the large zero-multipolarity diagonal matrix
elements of the Coulomb interaction [79]. The importance of this eﬀect can be seen by
noticing that the existence of the discrete spectrum excitations in noble gas atoms are due
only to this interaction (see, e.g., [86]).

The non-linear eﬀects of the correlation potential are calculated by iterating the self-
energy operator. These eﬀects are enhanced by the small denominator, which is the energy
for the excitation of an external electron (in comparison with the excitation energy of a core
electron) [79].

All other diagrams of perturbation theory are proportional to powers of the small pa-
2, where Qnd is a nondiagonal Coulomb integral and ∆ǫint is a large

rameter Qnd/∆ǫint ∼
energy denominator corresponding to the excitation of a core electron [79].

10−

1. Screening of the electron-electron interaction

The main correction to the correlation potential comes from the inclusion of the screening
of the Coulomb ﬁeld by the core electrons. Some examples of the lowest-order screening
corrections are presented in Fig. 3. When screening diagrams in the lowest (third) order
of perturbation theory are taken into account, a correction is obtained of opposite sign and
almost the same absolute value as the corresponding second-order diagram [78]. Due to these
strong cancellations there is a need to sum the whole chain of screening diagrams. However,

17

this task causes diﬃculties in standard perturbation theory as the screening diagrams in
the correlation correction cannot be represented by a simple geometric progression due to
the overlap of the energy denominators of diﬀerent loops (such an overlap indicates a large
number of excited electrons in the intermediate states, see e.g. Fig. 3(b,c)). This summation
problem is solved by using the Feynman diagram technique.

The correlation corrections to the energy in the Feynman diagram technique are pre-

sented in Fig. 4. The Feynman Green’s function is of the form

where ψn is an occupied core electron state, ψγ is a state outside the core. While the
simplest way of calculating the Green’s function is by direct summation over the discrete
and continuous spectrum, there is another method in which higher numerical accuracy can
be achieved. As is known, the radial Green’s function G0 for the equation without the
nonlocal exchange interaction Vexch can be expressed in terms of the solutions χ0 and χ
∞
of the Schr¨odinger or Dirac equation that are regular at r
, respectively:
(r>), r< = min(r1, r2), r> = max(r1, r2). The exchange interaction is

taken into account by solving the matrix equation ˆG = ˆG0 + ˆG0 ˆVexch ˆG. The polarization

Using formulae (26) and (28), it is easy to perform analytical integration over ω in the
calculation of the diagrams in Fig. 4. After integration, diagram 4(a) transforms to 2(a,c)
and diagram 4(b) transforms to 2(b,d).

Electron-electron screening, to all orders in the Coulomb interaction, corresponds to
the diagram chain presented in Fig. 6. To calculate this we perform summation of the
polarization operators before carrying out the integration over ω. The whole sum of screening
diagrams in Fig. 6 can be represented by

ˆπ(ω) = ˆΠ(ω)[1 + i ˆQ ˆΠ(ω)]−

1.

(29)

The integration over ω is performed numerically. The integration contour is rotated 90o
from the real axis to the complex ω plane parallel to the imaginary axis (see Fig. 7) – this
aids the numerical convergence by keeping the poles far from the integration contour.

The all-order electron-electron screening reduces the second-order correlation corrections

to the energies of S and P states of 133Cs by 40%.

2. The hole-particle interaction

The hole-particle interaction is presented diagrammatically in Fig. 8. This diagram
describes the alteration of the core potential due to the excitation of the electron from the
core to the virtual intermediate state. This electron now moves in the potential created
by the N
2 electrons, and no longer contributes to the Hartree-Fock potential. Denoting
ˆV0 as the zero multipolarity direct potential of the outgoing electron, the potential which
describes the excited and core states simultaneously is [79]

To obtain high accuracy, the hole-particle interaction in the polarization operator needs
to be taken into account in all orders (see Fig. 9). This is achieved by calculating the Green’s
function in the potential (30) and then using it in the expression for the polarization operator
(28). The screened polarization operator, with hole-particle interaction included, is found
by using the Green’s function in Eq. (29).

The Coulomb interaction, with screening and the hole-particle interaction included in all

orders, is calculated from the matrix equation [79]

−
This is depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 10.

˜Q = ˆQ

i ˆQˆπ ˆQ.

The inﬁnite series of diagrams representing the screening and hole-particle interaction can
now be included into the correlation potential. This is done by introducing the renormalized
Coulomb interaction (Fig. 10) and the polarization operator (Fig. 9) into the second-order
diagrams according to Fig. 11.

The screened second-order correlation corrections to the energies of S and P states of
cesium are increased by 30% when the hole-particle interaction is taken into account in all
orders.

3. Chaining of the self-energy

The accuracy of the calculations can be further improved by taking into account the
nonlinear contributions of the correlation potential ˆΣ (see Fig. 12). The chaining of the
correlation potential (Fig. 11) to all orders is calculated by adding ˆΣ to the Hartree-Fock
potential, ˆV N

iteratively for the states of the external electron. The inclusion of ˆΣ into the Schr¨odinger
equation is what we call the “correlation potential method” and the resulting orbitals and
energies “Brueckner” orbitals and “Brueckner” energies (see Section IV C).

Iterations of the correlation potential ˆΣ increase the contributions of ˆΣ (with screening

and hole-particle interaction) to the energies of S and P states of cesium by about 10%.

The ﬁnal results for the energies are listed in Table V. The inclusion of the three series
of higher-order diagrams improves the accuracy of the calculations of the energies to the
level of 0.1%.

E. Other low-order correlation diagrams

Third-order diagrams for the interaction of a hole and particle in the polarization loop
with an external electron are depicted in Fig. 13. These are not taken into account in
the method described above. However, these diagrams are of opposite sign and cancel each
other almost exactly [79]: the small and almost constant potential of a distant external
electron practically does not inﬂuence the wave functions of the core and excited electrons
in the loop; it shifts the energies of the core and excited electrons by the same amount. This
cancellation was proved in the work [87] by direct calculation.

Also, correlation corrections to the external electron energy arising from the inclusion
of the self-energy into orbitals belonging to closed electron shells, depicted in Fig. 14, are
small and can be safely omitted [65].

F. Empirical ﬁtting of the energies

The calculations of the external electron wave functions can be reﬁned by placing co-
f ˆΣ, such that the energies are reproduced
eﬃcients before the self-energy operator, ˆΣ
→
exactly. This can be considered as a way of including higher-order diagrams not explicitly
included in the calculations. Comparison of quantities calculated with and without ﬁtting
can be used to test the stability of the wave functions and to estimate the contribution of
unaccounted diagrams.

G. Asymptotic form of the correlation potential

At large distances, the correlation potential ˆΣ approaches the local polarization potential

where α is the polarizability of the core. This explains the universal behaviour of the
correlation corrections to the energies of states of the external electron.

H. Interaction with external ﬁelds

In this section we will describe the procedures used to achieve high accuracy in the
calculations of the interactions between atomic electrons and external ﬁelds (in particular, we
will present calculations for E1 transition amplitudes and hyperﬁne structure (hfs) constants,
arising from the interaction of the atomic electrons with the electric ﬁeld of the photon and
with the magnetic ﬁeld of the nucleus, respectively).

We need to calculate the eﬀect of the external ﬁeld on the wave functions of the core
electrons (core polarization) and then take into account the eﬀect of this polarization and
the external ﬁeld on the valence electron. This is achieved by using the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method. We describe this method in Section IV H 1 and apply it to
the calculation of E1 transition amplitudes and hfs constants in Sections IV H 2 and IV H 3,
respectively.

The dominant correlation corrections correspond to those diagrams in which the interac-
tions occur in the external lines of the self-energy operator (“Brueckner-type corrections”).
These diagrams are presented in Fig. 15; they are enhanced by the small energy denominator
ǫext corresponding to the excitation of the external electron in the intermediate states. The
Brueckner-type corrections are calculated in a similar way to the correlation corrections to
energy (see Sections IV H 1, IV H 2, IV H 3). In Section IV H 4 we describe the calculations
of the remaining second-order corrections, i.e., “structural radiation” and normalization of
states. Structural radiation diagrams are presented in Fig. 16; in these diagrams the exter-
nal ﬁelds occur in the internal lines, and so their contributions are small due to the large
energy denominators ǫint corresponding to the excitation of the core electrons. The rela-
tive suppression of the contributions of structural radiation compared to Brueckner-type
corrections is ǫext/ǫint ∼

1/10.

This section is largely based on the works [54,88].

1. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock method

The polarization eﬀects are taken into account by using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
method (see, e.g., [54,88] and references therein). We will consider how the RHF equations
are modiﬁed in the presence of a time-dependent ﬁeld

We can assume that the time-dependent single-particle orbitals are then given by

with corresponding eigenvalues (“quasi-energies”)

Using the TDHF procedure described above, core polarization is included in all orders
of perturbation theory. This is equilavent to summation of the diagram series presented in
Fig. 17.

The Brueckner-type correlation corrections are calculated in the same way as the cor-
rections to energies. Brueckner, instead of RHF, orbitals are used for α and β in Eq. (43).

22

This is equivalent to calculating the diagrams presented in Fig. 15. However, it must be
noted that by using this technique we neglect the diagrams in which the interaction takes
place in the internal lines (see Fig. 16), although these diagrams give only small corrections;
we will deal with these contributions in Section IV H 4. Also in Section IV H 4 we look at
another second-order correction: the normalization of the many-body states.

2. E1 transition amplitudes

ie(α

of an electromagnetic wave depends on the choice of gauge. In “length” form ˆfl = er
and in “velocity” form ˆfv =

E0/ω), where ˆhE1 = ˆf e−
It is known that in TDHF calculations the amplitude (43) is gauge invariant (see, e.g.,
[86,89,67]. Comparing results obtained from the two forms for the amplitudes (43) provides
a test of the numerical calculation. In [88], the length and velocity forms were shown to
give the same results for the E1 transition amplitudes when the correlation corrections
(correlation potential, frequency shift in the velocity form operator, structural radiation,
and normalization of states) are taken into account. Calculations using the dipole operator
in length form are more stable than those obtained in velocity form (see, e.g., [90,91,88]).
For this reason we consider the calculations of E1 transition amplitudes in length form.

iωt + ˆf †eiωt.

E0

·

As seen from Eq. (43), inclusion of the core polarization into the E1 transition amplitude
is reduced to the addition of the operator δ ˆVE1. Because the E1 operator can only mix
opposite parity states, there is no energy shift, and so when calculating the wave function
corrections χk and ηk from Eq. (39), δǫk = 0.

The results for E1 transition amplitudes calculated in length form between the lower

states of cesium are presented in Table VI.

Another test of the accuracy and self-consistency of the TDHF equations is the value of
an external electric ﬁeld at the nucleus. According to the Schiﬀ theorem [84], an external
static electric ﬁeld (ω = 0 in TDHF) at the nucleus in a neutral atom is shielded completely
by atomic electrons. For an atom with charge Zi the total static electric ﬁeld Etot at the
nucleus is [85]

Etot(0) = E0 +

Ee(0)
i

h

= E0Zi/Z ,

(45)

where E0 is the external ﬁeld and Ee is the induced electron ﬁeld. TDHF equations reproduce
this result correctly. The oscillations of the electric ﬁeld inside the atom are quite complex.
We refer the reader to [85] for a plot of the electric ﬁeld inside Tl+.4

When performing the calculation of the hyperﬁne structure of heavy atoms, it is important
to take into account the ﬁnite size of the nucleus. Using a simple model in which the nucleus
represents a uniformly magnetized ball, the hyperﬁne interaction is given by

Note that while the distribution of currents in the nucleus (produced by unpaired nucleons)
is very complex, the hfs is only weakly dependent on its form (see, e.g., [99]).

Corrections to the RHF wave functions induced by the hyperﬁne interaction are calcu-
lated using Eq. (39). There is no time-variation in the hyperﬁne interaction, and so we set
ω = 0. The hfs equations are then

gular on the nucleus, for example the PNC weak interaction.

4. Structural radiation and normalization of states

“Structural radiation” is the term we use for correlation corrections with the external
ﬁeld in the internal lines. (We will make a further distinction when we are dealing with the
PNC E1 amplitude EP N C, since here there are two ﬁelds. We call correlation corrections
with the weak interaction in the internal lines “weak correlation potential”; see Section
V A.) Examples of diagrams which represent structural radiation are presented in Fig. 16.
In second-order perturbation theory in the residual interaction there is another contribution
which arises due to the change of the normalization of the single-particle wave functions due
to admixture with many-particle states.

V. HIGH-PRECISION CALCULATION OF PARITY VIOLATION IN CESIUM
AND EXTRACTION OF THE NUCLEAR WEAK CHARGE

7S
In this section the method described in the preceding section is applied to the 6S
parity violating amplitude in cesium and the value for the nuclear weak charge is extracted
from the measurement of Wood et al. [8]. The value for this amplitude has been the source
It has jumped around erratically in the last few years, and
of much confusion recently.
ﬁnally it has stabilized. The origin of this instability is described below.

−

In 1999, experimentalists Bennett and Wieman argued that the standard model is in
contradiction with atomic experiments by 2.5 σ [77]. This conclusion was mainly based
on their analysis of the accuracy of atomic structure calculations which were published in
Ref. [57] in 1989 and in Ref. [16] in 1990,1992. The point is that the new measurements
of electromagnetic amplitudes in atoms have demonstrated that the accuracy of the atomic
calculations is much better than it seemed to be ten years ago. Indeed, all disagreements
between theory and experiments were resolved in favour of theory. Based on this, Bennett
and Wieman reduced the theoretical error from the 1% claimed by theorists [57,16] to 0.4%
and came to the conclusion that there may be new physics beyond the standard model.

Particle physicists put forward new physics possibilities, such as an extra Z boson in the

weak interaction, leptoquarks, and composite fermions; see, e.g., Refs. [103].

However, the 1% error placed on the atomic calculations [57,16] was based not only on
the comparison of measured and calculated quantities such as E1 transition amplitudes.
It was based also on an allowance for unnaccounted contributions. It was soon after dis-
covered that the Breit contribution is larger than expected (-0.6%) [104] (Section V A 2).
Then it was suggested that strong-ﬁeld radiative corrections could make a contribution as
large as Breit [105]. The Uehling contribution has been found to give a contribution of
0.4% [106,107] (Section V A 4). And just recently it has been established that self-energy
0.8% [108,109] (Section V A 4). A recent comprehensive
and vertex contributions are
calculation of atomic PNC is accurate to 0.5% [9]. The results of this calculation, and the
discussion of accuracy, are presented in the following sections. The ﬁnal value for parity
violation in cesium is in agreement with the standard model and tightly constrains possible
new physics (Section V C).

The numbers are from the work [16] where the sum-over-states method was used; here we
just demonstrate that these terms dominate. An advantage of the sum-over-states approach
is that experimental values for the energies and E1 transition amplitudes can be explicitly
included into the sum. This was the procedure for some of the early calculations of PNC in
Cs (see, e.g., [71]).

In Refs. [57,16,58,9] PNC calculations were performed in the mixed-states approach, and
in Ref. [16] a calculation was carried out in the sum-over-states approach also. Here we refer
to the most precise calculations,

1% accuracy.

5It is seen from Eqs. (3,4), by inserting the coeﬃcients C1N , that the density ρ(r) is essentially
the (poorly understood) neutron density in the nucleus. In the calculations, ρ(r) will be taken
equal to the charge density, Eq. (20), and then in Section V A 3 we will consider the eﬀect on the
PNC E1 amplitude as a result of correcting for ρ(r).

external weak and E1 ﬁelds is

ψ = ψ0 + δψ + Xe−

iωt + Y eiωt + δXe−

iωt + δY eiωt,

(57)

where ψ0 is the unperturbed state, δψ is the correction due to the weak interaction acting
alone, X and Y are corrections due to the photon ﬁeld acting alone, and δX and δY are
corrections due to both ﬁelds acting simultaneously. These corrections are found by solving
self-consistently the system of the TDHF equations for the core states

of the weak ﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld of the photon.

The corrections δψ6s and X6s are found by solving the equations (58-59) in the ﬁeld of the
frozen core (of course, the amplitude (63) can instead be expressed in terms of corrections
to ψ7s).

Now we need to include the correlation corrections to the PNC E1 amplitude. In the
previous sections (Sections IV C,IV D,IV H 4) we have discussed two types of corrections:
the dominant Brueckner-type corrections, represented by diagrams in which the external
ﬁeld appears in the external electron line (see Fig. 18); and structural radiation, in which
the external ﬁeld acts on an internal electron line. In the case of PNC E1 amplitudes, in
order to distinguish between structural radiation diagrams with diﬀerent ﬁelds, we refer to
diagrams with the weak interaction attached to the internal electron line as “weak correlation
potential” diagrams. Structural radiation and the weak correlation potential diagrams are
presented in Fig. 19.

We will consider ﬁrst the dominating Brueckner-type corrections to the E1 PNC ampli-
tude. Remember that the correlation potential is energy-dependent, ˆΣ = ˆΣ(ǫ). This means
that the ˆΣ operators for the 6s and 7s states are diﬀerent. We should consider the proper
energy-dependence at least in ﬁrst-order in ˆΣ (higher-order corrections are small and the
proper energy-dependence is not important for them). The ﬁrst-order in ˆΣ correction to
EP N C is presented diagrammatically in Fig. 18. We can write this as
ˆΣp(ǫ7s)

The non-linear in ˆΣ contribution to the Brueckner-type correction is found using the

and from this the ﬁrst-order contribution, found in the same method, is subtracted. The

induced by the weak interaction and the photon ﬁeld, found in the potential ˆV N
1 + ˆΣ. The
PNC E1 amplitude is then calculated, using these new orbitals, in the same way as in the
usual time-dependent Hartree-Fock method. The all-orders contribution to EP N C is

To complete the calculation of corrections second-order in the residual Coulomb inter-
action the weak correlation potential, structural radiation, and normalization contributions
to the PNC amplitude must be included.

The weak correlation potential is calculated by direct summation over intermediate
states. See Section IV H 4 for the approximate form for structural radiation in length form.
and for the form for the normalization of the many-body states. Due to parity violation
there is an opposite-parity correction to the orbitals α and β, ˜α = α + δα and ˜β = β + δβ,
and to the correlation potential ˆΣ, ˜Σ = ˆΣ + δ ˆΣ.

Structural radiation is then given by

There are two contributions to structural radiation for the PNC E1 amplitude: one in which
the electromagnetic vertex is parity conserving, the weak interaction included in the external
lines:

(see diagram (b) Fig. 19); and the other in which the weak interaction is included in the
electromagnetic vertex (we call this structural radiation and not weak correlation potential):

This corresponds to “Subtotal” of Table VIII. This is in agreement with the 1989 result
[57]. Notice the stability of the PNC amplitude. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock value
gives a contribution to the total amplitude of about 98%. The point is that there is a strong
cancellation of the correlation corrections.

The mixed-states approach has also been performed in [16] and [58] to determine the
PNC amplitude in cesium. However, in these works the screening of the electron-electron
interaction was included in a simpliﬁed way. In [16] empirical screening factors were placed
before the second-order correlation corrections ˆΣ(2) to ﬁt the experimental values of energies.
Kozlov et al. [58] introduced screening factors based on average screening factors calculated
for the Coulomb integrals between valence electron states. The results obtained by these
groups (without the Breit interaction, i.e., corresponding to the Subtotal of Table VIII) are
0.904 [16] and 0.905 [58].6 As a check, a pure second-order (i.e., using ˆΣ(2)) calculation with
energy-ﬁtting was also performed in [9] (in the same way as [16]), and the result 0.904 was
reproduced.

Contributions of the Breit interaction, the neutron distribution, and radiative corrections

to EP N C are considered in the following sections.

. It gives magnetic (Gaunt) and retardation
corrections to the Coulomb interaction. A few years ago it was thought that the correction
to EP N C arising due to inclusion of the Breit interaction in the Hamiltonian (15) is small
(safely smaller than 1%). In the work [57] the Breit interaction was neglected, and in [16] it
was only partially calculated. (Remember that these works claimed an accuracy of 1%.) The
huge improvement in the experimental precision of the cesium PNC measurement in 1997
[8] and the claim of Bennett and Wieman in 1999 [77] that the theoretical accuracy is 0.4%
prompted theorists to revisit their calculations. Naturally this also involves a consideration
of previously neglected contributions which, while at the 1% level could be neglected, are

interaction to EP N C and found that it is larger than had been expected. Its contribution to
EP N C is -0.6%. This result has been conﬁrmed by subsequent calculations [111,58,9].

3. Neutron distribution

The weak Hamiltonian Eq. (5) was used to obtain the result Eq. (71) with ρ(r) taken
to be the charge density, parametrized according to Eq. (20). However, as we mentioned in
a footnote at the beginning of Section V A, the weak interaction is sensitive to the distri-
bution of neutrons in the nucleus. Here we look at the eﬀect of correcting for the neutron
distribution.

It was noted in Ref. [105] that corrections to the PNC amplitude due to vacuum po-

Breit correction. This has been conﬁrmed by calculations, the strong-ﬁeld radiative correc-
tions associated with the Uehling potential (vacuum polarization) increase EP N C by 0.4%

also to the value obtained in [117].

energies (

5. Tests of accuracy

There are two main methods used to estimate the accuracy of the PNC amplitude EP N C:
(i) root-mean-square (rms) deviation of the calculated energy intervals, E1 amplitudes, and
hyperﬁne structure constants from the accurate experimental values; (ii) inﬂuence of ﬁtting
of energies and hyperﬁne structure constants on the PNC amplitude.

−

The PNC amplitude can be expressed as a sum over intermediate states (see beginning
of Section V A). Notice that there are three dominating contributions to the 6S
7S PNC
amplitude in Cs; see Eq. (56). Each term in the sum is a product of E1 transition amplitudes,
weak matrix elements, and energy denominators. Therefore, this amplitude is sensitive to
the electron wave functions at all distances. (The weak matrix elements, energies, and E1
amplitudes are sensitive to the wave functions at small, intermediate, and large distances
from the nucleus, respectively.) While mixed-states calculations of PNC amplitudes do not
involve a direct summation over intermediate states, it is instructive to analyze the accuracy
of the weak matrix elements, energy intervals, and E1 transition amplitudes which contribute
to Eq. (56) calculated using the same method as that used to calculate EP N C. The accuracy
of these quantities is determined by comparing the calculated values with experiment. Note
that we cannot directly compare weak matrix elements with experiment. However, like the
weak matrix elements, hyperﬁne structure is determined by the electron wave functions in
the vicinity of the nucleus, and this is known very accurately.

In Section IV we presented calculations of the energies, E1 transition amplitudes, and
7S EP N C. The states that have been

We mentioned at the end of Section IV D that the experimental values for energies can
be ﬁtted exactly by placing a coeﬃcient before the correlation potential ˆΣ. The stability of
the amplitude EP N C (as well as the E1 amplitudes and hfs constants) with ﬁtting gives us
an indication of the size of omitted contributions. Note that the accuracy for the energies
is already very high and the remaining discrepancy with experiment is of the same order of
magnitude as the Breit and radiative corrections. Therefore, generally speaking, we should
not expect that ﬁtting of the energy will always improve the results for amplitudes and
hyperﬁne structure. In fact, as we will see below, some values do improve while others do
not. The overall accuracy, however, remains at the same level.

31

energies.7 First, we analyse the E1 transition amplitudes and hfs constants calculated in
these approximations.

The relevant E1 transition amplitudes (radial integrals) are presented in Table VI. These
are calculated with the energy-ﬁtted “bare” correlation potential ˆΣ(2) and the (unﬁtted and
ﬁtted) “dressed” potential ˆΣ. Structural radiation and normalization contributions are also
included. The rms deviations of the calculated E1 amplitudes from experiment are the
following: without energy ﬁtting, the rms deviation is 0.1%; ﬁtting the energy gives a rms
deviation of 0.2% for ˆΣ(2) and 0.3% for the complete ˆΣ. Note, these correspond to the
deviations between the calculations and the central points of the measurements. The errors
associated with the measurements are in fact comparable to this diﬀerence. So it is unclear
if the theory is limited to this precision or is in fact much better. Regardless, the uncertainty
in the theoretical accuracy remains the same.

The hyperﬁne structure constants calculated in diﬀerent approximations are presented in
Table VII. Corrections due to the Breit interaction, structural radiation, and normalization
are included. The rms deviation of the calculated hfs values from experiment using the
unﬁtted ˆΣ is 0.5%. With ﬁtting, the rms deviation in the pure second-order approximation is

matrix elements. It seems reasonable then to use the square-root formula,
Notice that by using this approach the deviation is smaller. Without energy ﬁtting, the rms
deviation is 0.5%. With ﬁtting, the rms deviation in the second-order calculation ( ˆΣ(2)) is
0.2% and in the full calculation ( ˆΣ) it is 0.3%.

−

q

From the above consideration it is seen that the rms deviation for the relevant parameters
is 0.5% or better. Note that from this analysis the error for a sum-over-states calculation
of EP N C would be larger than this, as the errors for the energies, hfs constants, and E1
amplitudes contribute to each of the three terms in Eq. (56). However, in the mixed-states
approach, the errors do not add in this way.

We now consider calculations of the PNC amplitude performed in [9] in diﬀerent approx-
imations (with unﬁtted ˆΣ, and with energy-ﬁtted ˆΣ(2) and ˆΣ). The spread of the results can
be used to estimate the error. The results are listed in Table IX. It can be seen that the PNC
amplitude is very stable. The PNC amplitude is much more stable than hyperﬁne structure.
This can be explained by the much smaller correlation corrections to EP N C (
2% for EP N C
30% for hfs; compare Table VIII with Table VII). One can say that this small value
and
of the correlation correction is a result of cancellation of diﬀerent terms in (64) but each
term is not small (see Table VIII). However, this cancellation has a regular behaviour. The
stability of EP N C may be compared to the stability of the usual electromagnetic amplitudes
where the error is very small (even without ﬁtting).8

∼

∼

7Note that ﬁtting ˆΣ(2) is an empirical method to estimate screening corrections (which were
accurately calculated in ˆΣ). Agreement between results with ﬁtted ˆΣ(2) and ab initio ˆΣ shows that
the ﬁtting procedure is a reasonable way to estimate omitted diagrams.

8Note that diﬀerent methods also give diﬀerent signs of the errors for hfs. This is one more
argument that the true value of EP N C is somewhere in the interval between the results of diﬀerent
calculations in Table IX.

32

In [9] the ﬁtting of hyperﬁne structure was also considered, using diﬀerent coeﬃcients
before each ˆΣ. The ﬁrst-order in ˆΣ correlation correction (64) changes by about 10%. It
was found that the PNC amplitude changes by about 0.4%.

It is also instructive to look at the spread of EP N C obtained in diﬀerent schemes. The
result of the work [9] (the number we present here) is in excellent agreement with the earlier
result [57] while the calculation scheme is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The only other calculation
of the EP N C in Cs which is as complete as [57,9] is that of Blundell et al. [16]. Their result
in the all-orders sum-over-states approach is 0.909 (without Breit) and is very close to the
value of 0.908 (corresponding to “Subtotal” of Table VIII).

A note on the sum-over-states procedure. The authors of reference [16] include single,
double, and selected triple excitations into their wave functions. Note, however, that even if
wave functions of 6S, 7S, and intermediate NP states are calculated exactly (i.e., with all
conﬁguration mixing included) there are still some missed contributions in this approach.
Consider, e.g., the intermediate state 6P
It contains an admixture of states

5p5ns6d: 6P = 5p66p + α5p5ns6d + .... This mixed state is included into the sum (54).

α5p66p + ... should also be included into the sum.

Such contributions to EP N C have never been estimated directly within the sum-over-states
approach. However, they are included into the mixed-states calculations [57,16,58,9].

It is important to note that the omitted higher-order many-body corrections are diﬀerent
in the sum-over-states [16] and mixed-states [57,9] calculations. This may be considered as
an argument that the omitted many-body corrections in both calculations are small. Of
course, here it is assumed that the omitted many-body corrections to both values (which, in
principle, are completely diﬀerent) do not “conspire” to give exactly the same magnitude.
A comparison of calculations of EP N C in second-order with ﬁtting of the energies is also
useful in determining the accuracy of the calculations of EP N C. (Remember that this value
is in agreement with results of similar calculations performed in [16,58]; see Section V A 1.)
One can see that replacing the all-order ˆΣ by its very rough second-order (with ﬁtting)
approximation changes EP N C by less than 0.4% only. On the other hand, if the higher
orders are included accurately, the diﬀerence between the two very diﬀerent approaches is
0.1% only.

The maximum deviation obtained in the above analysis is 0.5%. This is the error claimed

in the EP N C calculation [9].

B. The vector transition polarizability

The determination of the nuclear weak charge from the Stark-PNC interference measure-
ments also requires knowledge of the vector transition polarizability β. This can be found
in a number of ways:

(i) from a direct calculation of β. β can be expressed as a sum over intermediate states
and experimental E1 transition amplitudes and energies can be used [14] (see also [16,120]).
However, this calculation is unstable due to strong cancellations of diﬀerent terms in the
sum (see Ref. [120]). These cancellations are explained by the fact that β is proportional
to the spin-orbit interaction, therefore for zero spin-orbit interaction the sum for β must be
zero;

33

(ii) from the measurement of the ratio of the oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne amplitude to the
vector transition polarizability, Mhf s/β [121]. β is then extracted from the ratio using a
theoretical determination of Mhf s;

(iii) from the measurement of the ratio of the scalar to vector polarizabilities, α/β. α can
be calculated accurately using experimental values for E1 transition amplitudes and energies
in the sum-over-states approach (the calculation of α is much more stable than that of β
[120]).

There are currently two very precise determinations of β. One was obtained from
the analysis [122] (calculation of Mhf s) of the measurement [77] of the ratio Mhf s/β,
β = 26.957(51)a3
B, and another is from an analysis [9] (semi-empirical calculation of α;
see [120] for details, where a similar calculation was performed) of the measurement [123]
of the ratio α/β using the most accurate experimental data for E1 transition amplitudes
including the recent measurements of Ref. [124], β = 27.15(11)a3

Let us brieﬂy consider the constraints on physics beyond the standard model set by the
nuclear weak charge of cesium [Eq. (77)]. New physics corrections to the standard model
are divided into two groups, those that originate through vacuum polarization corrections to

gauge boson propagators and those that originate from all other mechanisms (such as new
physics arising through vertex and self-energy diagrams and new tree-level physics). The
former are termed “oblique” and the latter “direct”.

A formalism for oblique corrections has been devised by Peskin and Takeuchi [126] in
terms of weak isospin conserving and weak isospin breaking parameters S and T , respectively.
Atomic parity violation (on a single isotope) is unique among other electroweak probes of
new physics in its almost exclusive dependence on the parameter S. Indeed, the dependence
of the nuclear weak charge on the parameter T cancels almost exactly. For 133Cs [125]

and references therein. For a recent analysis of electroweak tests of the standard model,
including atomic parity violation, see, e.g., [125,132,133]; an earlier review on this topic
[134] is also very informative.

D. Ongoing/future studies of PNC in atoms with a single valence electron

A PNC measurement in cesium is continuing at Paris [42], where

1% precision is
expected to be reached. The possibility of performing PNC measurements on the single
trapped ions Ba+ and Ra+ is being considered at Seattle [135,136]. Preliminary atomic

∼

10The result is actually not very sensitive to MH which is currently MH > 114.4 GeV at the 95%
conﬁdence level [127].

35

PNC calculations [137] indicate that the accuracy for calculations of Ba+ could compete
with that of cesium. An experiment to measure PNC in francium was discussed at Stony
Brook [138,139]. Francium is a heavier analog of cesium, and correspondingly the PNC
eﬀect is an order of magnitude (18 times [110]) larger than that for cesium. However, there
are no stable isotopes in francium. The group uses laser trapping to suspend the atoms.

A new facility (TRIµP) is under development at the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut,
Groningen. One aim is to measure parity violation in radioactive atoms and ions, attractive
candidates being Ra+ and Fr. See Ref. [140].

Note that the atomic theory is limited by the error associated with calculations of corre-
lation corrections. It’s expected that the relative corrections due to correlations are the same
in analogous atoms, e.g., cesium and rubidium. Thus, taking ratios of PNC measurements
in analogous atoms possibly provides a way to circumvent the troublesome correlations in
the determination of the ratio of the nuclear weak charges. [Another way to exclude atomic
theory is through isotope ratios, see Section VI B.] Light atoms by themselves may provide
some advantage from the point of view of atomic theory. Breit, neutron skin, and QED
radiative corrections for rubidium are much smaller than for cesium. Therefore, atomic
PNC calculations for rubidium could, in principle, reach a precision better than for cesium,
however the amplitude is much smaller [70,54], about 6 times [54].

VI. ATOMS WITH SEVERAL ELECTRONS IN UNFILLED SHELLS

There are some advantages in measuring PNC eﬀects in heavier atoms (where the PNC
signal is expected to be larger) with relatively complicated electronic structure. However, the
interpretation of the measurements in such a case is strongly impeded by the poor knowledge
of the atomic wave functions. Even for Tl, which has a relatively simple structure, the atomic
theory has an error of 2.5-3% [54,55].

The method we discussed in Sections IV and V is applicable for heavy alkali-metal atoms.
However, this method may not be accurate for atoms with more than one electron in unﬁlled
shells. This is because the correlations between the electrons in the unﬁlled shells may be
important.

The most eﬀective many-body method for atoms with several electrons above closed
shells was developed in the works [141,142] (see also [56]). It is a combination of many-body
perturbation theory and conﬁguration interaction methods (it is called “MBPT+CI”). An
eﬀective Hamiltonian is constructed for the valence electrons using many-body perturbation
theory for the interaction of the valence electrons with the core. In this way the correlations
between the external electrons and the core are taken into account using MBPT while the
correlations between the external electrons are calculated using the CI method.

A detailed description of the MBPT+CI method is beyond the scope of this review. We

refer the interested reader to the works [141,142].

Let us move on now to the calculations. The electronic conﬁguration for the ground
state of thallium is 6s26p1/2. This system can be treated as a one-electron or a three-
electron system above closed shells. However, the 6p electron is energetically close to the 6s
electrons, and correlations between 6s and 6p are signiﬁcant. This means that the method
described in Sections IV,V will not be as eﬀective for thallium as for cesium. This method

B. A method to exclude the error from atomic theory: isotope ratios and the
neutron distribution

In Ref. [47] it was pointed out that atomic theory (and hence the large associated error)
can be excluded by taking ratios of atomic PNC measurements along an isotope chain.
Indeed, from a simple non-relativistic consideration, the measured parity violating amplitude
can be expressed as

where the atomic theory is included into ξ.
ratios of measurements of diﬀerent isotopes with neutron numbers N and N ′

It is seen that in this approximation taking

AP N C = ξQW ,

AP N C(N ′)
AP N C(N)

=

QW (N ′)
QW (N)

removes the dependence on ξ, assuming that the atomic structure does not change signiﬁ-
cantly from isotope to isotope. However, a consideration of relativistic eﬀects (the variation
of the electron wave functions inside the nucleus) changes this simple formulation.

It was shown in Ref. [146] that while the atomic structure cancels in the isotope ratios,
there is an enhanced sensitivity to the neutron distribution ρn(r), and the uncertainty as-
sociated with ρn(r) may limit the extraction of new physics. The dependence of the PNC
amplitude on nuclear structure eﬀects can be incorporated through the correction Qnuc [146],

neutron distributions, and it is the error associated with this diﬀerence, δ(∆qn), that could
limit the interpretation of the ratio R of the PNC measurements in heavy atoms in terms
of new physics.

The isotope ratios are sensitive to a combination of new physics that is diﬀerent from
that probed by measurements of parity violation in a single isotope. While measurements
of atomic parity violation in a single isotope are sensitive to the weak isospin conserving
parameter S and to new tree level physics, the isotope ratios are sensitive to both S and T
through sin2 θW as well as to new tree level physics. The sensitivity of the isotope ratios to
oblique new physics has been investigated in [128,147,148], and the sensitivity to direct new
physics in [131,148].

Nuclear structure corrections to the weak charge distribution have been calculated for
diﬀerent isotopes of lead [148,149], cesium [150,149,151], barium [149], and ytterbium [149].
The calculations are model-dependent, and it is seen from the spread in the results that
at this time our knowledge of the neutron distribution would preclude a determination
of new physics competitive with other probes. The problem is that there is a very limited
amount of empirical information on neutron distributions. In Ref. [152] new data on neutron
distributions from experiments with antiprotonic atoms was used to re-analyze the impact
of the nuclear structure uncertainties on the extraction of new physics. It was found that the
errors associated with nuclear structure are slightly reduced compared with those associated
with nuclear calculations. It was suggested that isotope ratios of PNC measurements with
atoms having Z <
50 may be more eﬀective at searching for new physics, since the nuclear
∼
structure uncertainty in the extraction of (direct) new physics increases roughly as Z 8/3 and
the required experimental uncertainty is less strict for lighter atoms [152]. Since the PNC
Z 3, this would only be feasible if there is an accidental enhancement of the PNC
signal
eﬀect (for example, very close levels of opposite parity).

∝

The high sensitivity of isotope ratios of PNC measurements to variations in the neutron
distribution could be used to determine the nuclear structure and test nuclear models [146].
Parity violating electron scattering measurements appear to be very promising for extracting
information on the neutron distribution (see, e.g, [153]). It appears that such measurements
could be used to signiﬁcantly reduce the nuclear structure uncertainties to the level where
the new physics sensitivity of PNC isotope ratios is signiﬁcant.

C. Ongoing/future studies of PNC in complex atoms

A thallium PNC measurement is continuing at Seattle [154] in which sub-1% accuracy
is expected to be reached. Experimental studies of rare-earth elements dysprosium and yt-
terbium are in progress at Berkeley [155]. Studies with dysprosium are continuing despite
the small upper limit found for the PNC amplitude [50]. Dysprosium appeared to be par-
ticularly attractive for PNC studies due to the presence of a state (4f 95d26s J = 10) that

39

is nearly degenerate with the state 4f 105d6s J = 10 with opposite parity and the same
angular momentum. However, the weak interaction does not mix the dominant electronic
conﬁgurations of the nearly degenerate states, a non-zero weak matrix element shows up
only through conﬁguration mixing and core polarization which makes it very small. An
improvement in the statistical sensitivity of a few orders of magnitude is anticipated in the
current search [50,156]. If the eﬀect is of the same order of magnitude as the current upper
limit, then dysprosium will provide an important test of the standard model and allow the
determination of the nuclear anapole moment [50,156]. A measurement of PNC in ytterbium
is in progress also at Berkeley [157,158]. In ytterbium there are seven stable isotopes in the
range A = 168
176 with two of these isotopes having non-zero nuclear spin (possibility
to observe the nuclear anapole moment). The atomic theory in this case should be more
reliable than in the other rare-earth atoms, since here there is a closed 4f -shell.

PNC studies with samarium appear to have no advantages over other systems. Prelimi-
nary work showed that PNC optical rotation on the forbidden M1 transition 4f 66s2 7F0 −
1) opposite parity
4f 65d6s 7G1, which could have beneﬁted from having close (
states, is not feasible [159]. Moreover, it has recently been found, through a term reassign-
ment of several of the odd-parity states in Sm [160], that an estimate of the weak matrix
element made in the original proposal for the experiment [161] should be reduced by about
40 times. The null PNC results of the Oxford group reported in Refs. [48,49] for M1 tran-
sitions between the ground state conﬁguration show that the possible enhancement due to
1) is not realized due to very small E1
the relatively small energy denominators (
and weak matrix elements.

There are some interesting proposals for new experiments where large enhancements are
expected. E.g., atomic calculations [162,163] indicate that parity violation in the electronic
7s6d 3D1 of the radium isotopes 223Ra and 225Ra are enhanced due
transitions 7s2 1S0 −
to a very small interval between the states 7s7p 3P 1 and 7s6d 3D1. The parity violating
amplitude is calculated to be 100 times larger than that of Cs. (Note that the electronic
structure of radium is relatively simple and so it is expected that the PNC amplitude will
not suﬀer from large suppressions that appeared in the PNC amplitudes of the rare earth
atoms.)

VII. THE NUCLEAR ANAPOLE MOMENT AND MEASUREMENTS OF P-ODD
NUCLEAR FORCES IN ATOMIC EXPERIMENTS

A. The anapole moment

The notion of the anapole moment was introduced by Zel’dovich [164] just after the
discovery of parity violation. He noted that a particle may have a parity violating elec-
tromagnetic form factor, in addition to the usual electric and magnetic form factors. The
ﬁrst realistic example, the anapole moment of the nucleus, was considered in Ref. [20] and
calculated in Ref. [21]. In these works it was also demonstrated that atomic and molecular
experiments could detect anapole moments. Subsequently, a number of experiments were
performed in Paris, Boulder, Oxford, and Seattle [40,43,44,37,38] and some limits on the
magnitude of the anapole moment were established. However, it was only recently that a
nuclear anapole moment was unambiguously detected – in 1997 a group in Boulder measured

40

a nuclear anapole moment in 133Cs (using atomic experiments) to an accuracy of 14% [8]
(see also the recent review [177]). This is the ﬁrst observation of an electromagnetic moment
that violates fundamental discrete symmetries.

Besides the usual electric and magnetic monopole, dipole and quadrupole (and so on)
moments, there are also other electromagnetic multipole moments, which are not usually
dealt with in multipole moment expansions as they give rise to contact, rather than long-
range, potentials. The anapole moment is such a moment. It obeys time reversal invariance
but violates parity conservation and charge conjugation invariance (i.e., T -even and P - and
C-odd). The anapole moment arises out of an expansion of the vector potential as a series in
1, where R is the distance from the center of the charge distribution (see, e.g., [165,12]).

The part of the vector potential that is due to the anapole moment is11

j is the electromagnetic current density. Eq.
(98) can be taken as the deﬁnition of the
anapole moment. Notice the contact form of the potential – this is true for any T -even,
P -odd moment; see, e.g., [20,12] for a proof.

What kind of current distribution corresponds to an anapole moment? Such a current
distribution is shown in Fig. 20. This will give a nonzero anapole moment, because the
places at which the current is pointing downwards are further from the center than the
places where the current is pointing upwards. Since the current in Eq. (98) is weighted by a
factor of r2 this current distribution will produce an anapole moment pointing perpendicular
to the plane of the doughnut. A magnetic ﬁeld is produced inside the current distribution,
as shown in the ﬁgure.

=

ˆa
i

The expression for the anapole moment (98) contains the current vector j, which changes
its sign under reﬂection of co-ordinates. The anapole moment is directed along the nuclear
spin I:
= aI/I. However, the spin I does not change its sign under co-
ordinate reﬂection. The diﬀerent behavior of the right and left hand sides of the relation
r2j
I under reﬂection of co-ordinates means that the existence of the anapole moment
h
violates parity, i.e., symmetry under the reﬂection of co-ordinates (but it does not violate
time reversal invariance).

B. Origin of the nuclear anapole moment

We now turn to the question of how an anapole moment can actually be produced.
A T -even, P -odd moment like the anapole can only arise if there is some kind of P -odd
force present; for this the weak interaction is needed. The two-body P -odd nucleon-nucleon
interaction, in the contact limit, has the form (see, e.g., [12])

If, for example,
the unperturbed wave function was in a spin up state, the spin at diﬀerent points for the
perturbed wave function will be as shown in Fig. 21. Thus we have a spin helix, with a
deﬁnite chirality, i.e., right- or left-handedness (see, e.g., [12]). This means that the parity
symmetry has been broken. Now consider the current and magnetic ﬁeld produced by such
a spin helix. The electromagnetic current of the unpaired nucleon in the non-relativistic

the dominating contribution. The current distribution and the magnetic ﬁeld produced by
the wave function ψ of Eq. (102) have been calculated, e.g., in Ref. [167].

and r0 = 1.2 fm. It is the dependence on A2/3 that makes the anapole moment the dominant
nuclear spin-dependent eﬀect in heavy atoms.

Single-particle calculations of κa for Cs in the Woods-Saxon and harmonic oscillator
potentials have been performed in Refs. [21,168,19,174] (note that in Refs. [168,19] the eﬀects
of conﬁguration mixing were also included semi-empirically) and many-body calculations in
Refs. [169–172]. The results of these calculations are presented in Table X; a compilation of
these results in terms of DDH “best values” (see Section VII E) can also be found in Ref.
[173]. Single-particle calculations for the anapole moment are remarkably stable with the
choice of potential [174]. We will quote the value

κSP

(108)

for 133Cs, obtained from numerical calculations in the Woods-Saxon potential with spin-orbit
interaction [21,174]. We will leave the discussion of many-body eﬀects to Section VII E.

C. Parity violating eﬀects in atoms dependent on the nuclear spin

The nuclear anapole moment interacts with an atom’s electrons due to its magnetic ﬁeld.

The interaction is [using Eqs. (97) and (105)]

where A is the anapole vector-potential and α is the relativistic velocity operator (Dirac
matrices). The magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to the anapole is localized inside the nucleus.
Therefore the interaction with atomic electrons occurs only if the electron wave functions
penetrate the nucleus.

43

The anapole moment produces parity violating nuclear spin-dependent eﬀects in atoms.
In heavy atoms it is the dominant mechanism producing such eﬀects. However, its ef-
fects are indistinguishable from the smaller parity violating neutral current eﬀects, and
these need to be accounted for in the extraction of κa from atomic measurements (we men-
tioned these eﬀects brieﬂy in Section II 2). One contribution to parity violating nuclear
spin-dependent eﬀects arises from Z 0 exchange in an electron-nucleus interaction, with an
axial-vector Z 0-nucleus coupling and a vector Z 0-electron coupling [Eq. (9)]; see Ref. [175].
Another contribution arises from the perturbation of the nuclear spin-independent contri-
bution, corresponding to the nuclear weak charge, by the hyperﬁne interaction (Eq. (10));
see [18,19,176]. The total eﬀective nuclear spin-dependent interaction can be expressed in

D. Measurement of nuclear spin-dependent eﬀects in cesium and extraction of the
nuclear anapole moment

The anapole moment can be detected by observing the amplitudes of transitions between
atomic levels that violate parity. In the case of the Boulder experiment [8], it was an E1
transition between the 6S and 7S states of the cesium atom. The nuclear spin-dependent
P -odd eﬀects can be separated from the dominant eﬀect (the weak interaction between the
electron and the weak charge of the nucleus; see Sections III,V) by observing the dependence
of the parity violating eﬀects in two diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions. The nuclear spin has
diﬀerent relative orientations in the diﬀerent hyperﬁne states. For 133Cs, F = 3 and F = 4,
where F is the total angular momentum of the atom (F = J + I, where J is the electron’s
7SF =4,
angular momentum). By observing the transitions 6SF =4 →
the anapole moment can be detected. In the Boulder experiment [8] these two amplitudes
were measured, and they were found to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, indicating the presence of
an anapole moment.

7SF =3 and 6SF =3 →

1. Atomic calculations and extraction of κ

Atomic many-body calculations are required to extract the eﬀective constant κ from
experiment. Atomic calculations of nuclear spin-dependent eﬀects in cesium have been per-

12Note that diﬀerent deﬁnitions for κ, κa, κ2, κQ are used in diﬀerent works. For example, in

formed in [175,178,179,168,16,176]. In [180] the value for κ was extracted from [8] by taking
the ratio of the nuclear spin dependent PNC amplitude to the main spin independent PNC
amplitude, using the spin dependent calculation [179] and the spin independent calculation
[54]. The calculations [179,54] were performed in the relativistic Hartree-Fock approxima-
tion, with the eﬀects of core polarization included using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
method and correlations included through the use of Brueckner orbitals (see Section IV).
These calculations were performed using the same method and computer codes, so the the-
oretical errors should cancel in the ratio. The value obtained in [180] is

κ(133Cs) = 0.442(63) .

(112)

In the recent work [176] the value κ(133Cs) = 0.462(63) was obtained. The calculations were
performed in zeroth-order in the relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation, and core polariza-
tion was included using the random phase approximation. This result was extracted directly
from the spin-dependent component measured in [8], with β from [77]. The 4% diﬀerence
between the two values for κ(133Cs) is explained by correlation corrections: correlation cor-
rections (Brueckner orbitals) are included in [179], while they are not considered in [176].
At the TDHF level, the results coincide.

2. Extraction of κa

C2p ≈ −
−

The value of κ contains three contributions (see Eq. (111)). The contributions to κ from
the nuclear spin-dependent neutral current κ2 and from the combined neutral weak charge
and hyperﬁne interaction κQ must be subtracted to give the anapole constant κa. In the
0.05 [see Section II, Eq. (9)]. Large-basis
single-particle approximation, κ2 =
nuclear shell-model calculations for 133Cs give κ2 =
0.063 [172]. Atomic calculations for
the combined weak charge and hyperﬁne interaction have been performed in [18,19,176]. The
recent calculation [176] is the most complete: it was performed in third-order perturbation
theory, with core polarization taken into account in the random phase approximation. In
the other calculations [18,19] the single-particle form for the operator [Eq. (10)] was used.
The result of Johnson et al. [176] for 133Cs is κQ = 0.017. Results of calculations for κ2 and
κQ are compiled in Table XI. With κ2 from [172] and κQ from [176], the anapole moment
constant is

The interaction (109) is for a point-like nucleus. However, a real nucleus has a ﬁnite size.
In the works [178,179,168,16,176] the atomic calculations were performed by replacing δ3(r)
with the nuclear density ρ(r). A more accurate treatment of ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀects was
given in [167,180]. For Cs the correction is small. The corrected value for κa [Eq. (113)] is

The weak potential is usually parametrized in terms of a one-boson exchange model. The
proton-nucleus and neutron-nucleus constants, gp and gn, can be expressed in terms of the

π and the h’s are weak meson-nucleon coupling constants — the subscript denotes the
fπ ≡
type of meson involved and the superscript indicates whether it is an isoscalar, isovector or
isotensor interaction (0, 1, or 2). These are the eﬀective constants obtained in the contact
limit of the nucleon-nucleon PNC interaction [Eq. (99)], with short-range nucleon-nucleon
repulsion and long-range eﬀects taken into account through the parameters Wρ and Wπ.
Following [21,180], we take Wρ = 0.4 and Wπ = 0.16 using calculations of PNC for neutron
and proton scattering on 4He [183].

The standard reference values for weak meson-nucleon couplings are those of Desplan-
ques, Donoghue, and Holstein [182] [we list the DDH “best values” for the weak couplings
and the eﬀective coupling constants (Eqs. (115,116,101); Refs. [21,184,174]) in terms of these
values in Table XII for easy reference]. However, there are large uncertainties in the possible
values (known as the “DDH reasonable ranges”). It is therefore important to determine the
weak coupling constants experimentally. Information on these constants can be obtained
from the measurement of the Cs anapole moment.

1. The cesium result and comparison with other experiments

However, there is a serious discrepancy between the weak meson-nucleon couplings ex-
tracted from the Cs anapole moment and those extracted from other experiments. The
following experiments are thought to give reliable information on the weak meson-nucleon
couplings (that is, their interpretation is not hindered too much by nuclear structure un-
certainties) [187,172]: the longitudinal analyzing power for ~pp scattering at 13.6 MeV [188],
45 MeV [189], and 221 MeV [190] and ~pα scattering at 46 MeV [191], the circular polariza-
tion of γ-rays emitted from the 1081 keV state in 18F [192], and the asymmetry of γ-rays
emitted in the decay of the state 110 keV in polarized 19F [193]. These experiments depend
on diﬀerent combinations of the coupling constants. They are consistent and favor a small

value of fπ, roughly lying between
with the Cs anapole result.

The value for fπ extracted above for Cs was obtained in the single particle model. Let us
brieﬂy discuss how this value changes when many-body eﬀects are included. Core polariza-
tion eﬀects have been calculated in Refs. [170,171] using the random phase approximation.
In Ref. [171] it was found that for 133Cs core polarization and pairing eﬀects decrease the
single-particle value for κa by almost a factor of two. These calculations therefore increase
the discrepancy of the cesium result with other experiments and with the DDH best value.
Large-basis shell model calculations have been performed in Refs. [169,172]. These calcula-
tions also reduce the size of κa, although not to the extent of the calculation [171].

In Table X results of single-particle and many-body calculations of κa for 133Cs are
presented. It appears that consideration of many-body eﬀects tends to exacerbate the dis-
agreement between the meson-nucleon couplings extracted from the Cs anapole moment and
those obtained from other experiments.

Note that there may be other signiﬁcant corrections to the anapole moment calculations
that may resolve the discrepancy between theory and experiment. For instance, consid-
eration of the strong renormalization of the weak potential [168,194]. Another correction
to the calculations could stem from the use of an improved set of strong meson-nucleon
coupling constants. (In the one-boson exchange model the weak potential is formed from a
product of weak and strong meson-nucleon couplings. The strong couplings gπ = 13.45,
gρ = 2.79, gω = 8.37 and the isoscalar χS =
0.12 and isovector χV = 3.7 anoma-
lous magnetic moments of the nucleon have been employed in the calculations; see, e.g.,
[182,183,172,195]. These values were used to arrive at Eqs. (115,116)). In the recent work
[195] it was shown that using strong coupling constants in the one-boson exchange model
constrained by nucleon-nucleon phase shifts leads to an enhancement of parity violating
eﬀects by about a factor of two.

−

The cesium anapole moment is not the only case in which parity violating eﬀects appear
to be enhanced. Parity violation in the Mossbauer transitions in 57Fe and 199Sn nuclei give
a value for the circular polarization of γ-rays at least four orders of magnitude larger than
calculations (see Ref. [184]). Statistical methods were applied in Refs. [196,197] to study
parity violating eﬀects in polarized neutron scattering from compound nuclei. It was found
in Ref. [197] that the experiments give parity violating eﬀects 1.7
3 times larger than those
estimated using the DDH values for weak meson-nucleon couplings.

The Cs anapole measurement is also inconsistent with the limit on the anapole moment

of Tl [38],

±

(119)

In fact, the Tl anapole moment itself produces problems. Its central point is of opposite
sign to that predicted by theory.13 Results of calculations of κa for Tl are presented in
Table XIII (these results in terms of DDH “best values” can also be found in [173]). Using
DDH best values for the weak couplings, the most complete many-body calculations of the
anapole moment of Tl give κa(Tl) = 0.24 within RPA [171] and κa(Tl) = 0.24 [199] and
κa(Tl) = 0.10 [172] in shell model calculations.

Note that the anapole moment of Tl extracted above (119) was obtained from the nu-
clear spin-dependent component of the PNC optical rotation using a single-particle atomic
calculation [198]. In a recent many-body calculation [200], in which the MBPT+CI method
was implemented (see Section VI for a brief description and references), the central point for
0.26; that is, the disagreement with theory
the Tl anapole moment is interpreted as κa =
is more obvious.

−

F. Ongoing/future studies of nuclear anapole moments

It is clear that further experimental investigation is required to resolve these inconsisten-
cies. An improved measurement of the Tl anapole moment is important, as is an anapole
measurement involving a nucleus with an unpaired neutron (Cs and Tl have unpaired pro-
tons). This latter experiment would give information on gn which depends on a diﬀerent
combination of weak meson-nucleon couplings that are roughly perpendicular to the current
anapole measurements (compare Eqs. (115,116)) and so would provide a very important
cross-check.

We have already discussed in Sections V D,VI C the PNC experiments underway. Nuclear

spin-dependent eﬀects in those atoms with non-zero nuclear spin will be measured.

7s6d 3D1 and 7s2 1S0 −

Enhancement of anapole moment eﬀects in atoms can occur due to close levels of opposite
parity. For example, calculations [162,163] show that the PNC amplitudes in the transitions
7s6d 3D2 in 223Ra and 225Ra can be more than 1000
7s2 1S0 −
times larger than the nuclear spin-dependent transition amplitudes in Cs. Moreover, in the
7s6d 3D2 there is no background nuclear spin-independent amplitude,
transition 7s2 1S0 −
since the large change in angular momentum ∆J = 2 forbids it. Note that measurements
with 223,225Ra, sensitive to the neutron constant gn, would provide a sought-after cross-check
on the parity violating meson-nucleon couplings.

Work towards measurements of anapole moments in diatomic molecules is underway
[201]. Diatomic molecules are attractive for anapole moment searches because the nuclear
spin-dependent eﬀects, but not the (usually dominating) nuclear spin-independent ones, are
enhanced compared to atoms due to the presence of close rotational levels of opposite parity
[202,203]; see also the review [204].

13Note that while the Oxford result [37], κ(Tl) = 0.23
1.20 [using the single-particle atomic
calculation [198] used to obtain (119)], has a central point that is positive, its error is four times
larger than the Seattle value [38]. The Oxford result has been misquoted in the literature.

VIII. ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENTS: MANIFESTATION OF TIME
REVERSAL VIOLATION IN ATOMS

Violation of CP symmetry (combined symmetry of charge conjugation, C, and parity)
was discovered in 1964 in the decays of the neutral K mesons [205].
It is incorporated
into the standard electroweak model as a single complex phase in the quark mixing matrix
(Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism [206]). For a long time K mesons remained the only system
in which CP violation had been observed, until just recently, in 2001, when the collaborations
BaBar and Belle detected it in the neutral B mesons [207]. The CP violation seen there is
consistent with the standard model predictions.

However, a striking problem arises from cosmology. Sakharov proposed that CP viola-
tion, present at the time of the Big Bang, is a necessary ingredient in the asymmetry of
matter and antimatter [208]. It is well-known that standard model CP violation is insuﬃ-
cient to generate the level of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Understanding
the origin of CP violation and searching for possible new sources is therefore a very inter-
esting and fundamental problem.

If CP T is a good symmetry, as it is in gauge theories, then CP violation is accompanied
by T (time-reversal) violation. So far there has been no (undisputed) direct observation of
T violation and its detection is of interest in its own right. Also, detection of T-violation
may shed light on the origin of CP violation. The measurement of a permanent electric
dipole moment (EDM) of, e.g., a neutron, atom, or molecule would be direct evidence of
T -violation. This can be seen very simply: an EDM, d, of a non-degenerate quantum system
is directed along the total angular momentum F (the only vector specifying the system), and
such a correlation can only occur if both T and P are violated (d and F behave diﬀerently
on reversal of r and t).

T violating electric dipole moments have an extraordinary sensitivity to new models of
CP violation. The reason is that the standard model CP violation, appearing through just
a single phase, is highly suppressed in such ﬂavour-conserving phenomena. In particular,
34 e cm [209], with the
the standard model prediction for the neutron EDM is dn(SM)
proton EDM the same order of magnitude, and the electron EDM is even smaller de(SM) <
∼
38 e cm [210]. The EDMs appear only in high-order loops (3-loop diagrams for the neutron
10−
and 3- to 4-loop diagrams for the electron). The new sources of CP violation appearing in
new theories generate EDMs that are many orders of magnitude larger than the standard
model values and the size of these EDMs are in reach of current experiments. Already
the parameter space of popular theories such as supersymmetry, multi-Higgs models, and
left-right symmetric models are strongly restricted by current measurements.

10−

∼

A CP -violating phase also appears in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and it can be
constrained (or detected) from EDM measurements. It deﬁnes the strength of the P - and
T -violating term in the QCD Lagrangian containing Gµν ˜Gµν (this is analogous to Fµν ˜Fµν
B, clearly a P, T -violating correlation; see, e.g,
in electrodynamics which reduces to E

to this problem involves the introduction of a new Goldstone boson known as the “axion”

experimental searches, there is no evidence of its existence. (For a review of experimental

A. Atomic EDMs

In this section we will consider the contributions to an atomic EDM arising from various
P, T -odd mechanisms. Contributions to an atomic EDM arise from (i) the sum of intrinsic
EDMs of the atomic constituents (averaged over the atomic state) and (ii) the mixing of
opposite parity wave functions due to a P, T -odd interaction ˆHP T .

1. Electronic enhancement mechanisms

What are the mechanisms that lead to enhancement of parity and time invariance vio-
lating eﬀects in atoms? Like the P -odd, T -even eﬀects we discussed in the ﬁrst part of this
review, the eﬀects of P, T -violation increase in atoms with:

(i) a high nuclear charge Z. P, T -odd eﬀects in atoms increase rapidly with Z, [213,214].

Therefore, it is best to search for atomic EDMs in heavy atoms.

(ii) close levels of opposite parity. From Eq. (120) we can see that if HP T mixes oppo-
E2, then the atomic EDM induced will be enhanced,
E2). This enhancement occurs, for example, in rare-earth atoms, where

site parity levels with energies E1 ≈
datom ∝
there are anomalously close levels of opposite parity.

B. Enhancement of T -odd eﬀects in polar diatomic molecules

Sandars was the ﬁrst to point out the enhancement of T -odd eﬀects in polar diatomic
molecules compared to atoms in his proposal to measure the proton EDM in TlF [215].
The idea is to polarize the molecules along an external electric ﬁeld, thereby aligning the
enormous intramolecular ﬁeld, leading to an eﬀective enhancement of the external ﬁeld by
several orders of magnitude. This enhancement mechanism is related to that arising from

50

the presence of close rotational levels of opposite parity [203]. The two cases correspond to
the respective cases of strong and weak interactions with the electric ﬁeld compared to the
rotational level spacing. See [204] for a review.

To date, permanent EDMs in neutrons, atoms, and molecules have escaped detection.
Null measurements of EDMs have been obtained for the paramagnetic atoms 85Rb [216,217],
133Cs [218–220], 205Tl [221–224,11], and 129Xe in the metastable state 5p56s 3P2 [225] and,
very recently, the molecule YbF in the ground state [226]. An experiment aimed to measure
the EDM of the ion Fe3+ in the solid state was carried out a long time ago [227]. Interest to
carry out measurements in solids, in particular in gadolinium gallium garnet and gadolinium
iron garnet, has been sparked recently [228,229] (see Section X). In diamagnetic systems,
EDM experiments have been performed for atomic 129Xe [230,231] and 199Hg [232,233,10] in
the ground states and for the polar molecule TlF [234–238].

·

Measurements of EDMs in paramagnetic systems (that is, with non-zero total electron
angular momentum) are most sensitive to leptonic sources of P, T -violation, in particular
the electron EDM, while measurements of EDMs in diamagnetic systems (zero total electron
angular momentum) are most sensitive to P, T -odd mechanisms in the hadronic sector.
Both are sensitive to P, T -odd semi-leptonic processes (the electron-nucleon interaction),
the former to those involving the electron spin, and the latter to those involving the nuclear
spin.

As we will see in Section X, at the most fundamental scale the limits on P, T -violating
parameters from the measurement (124) are more strict than those from the neutron mea-
surements (125) due to the presence of a nucleon-nucleon P, T -violating interaction that
induces P, T -violating nuclear moments more eﬃciently than does an intrinsic EDM of a
nucleon.

It is interesting that although the 199Hg nucleus has an unpaired neutron, the measure-
ment (124) sets a constraint on the proton EDM (it contributes due to conﬁguration mixing)
that is tighter than that from the measurement of the EDM of the TlF molecule (Tl has an
unpaired proton) used in the past to set the proton EDM upper limit. In TlF the P, T -odd

The coupling constant d can be expressed, e.g., in terms of permanent EDMs of the proton
and electron and P, T -violating interactions; such calculations for TlF have been performed
in [215,242–244,165,18,245–247]; see, e.g, Ref. [238] for a general overview. The limit on the
proton EDM following from the calculations of Ref. [247] is presented in Table XIX.

A more detailed comparison of limits on P, T -violating parameters will be postponed
until Section X. In the following sections we discuss the diﬀerent mechanisms that induce
atomic EDMs.

D. Mechanisms that induce atomic EDMs

An external electric ﬁeld acting on a neutral atom consisting of non-relativistic point-like
charged particles with EDMs, interacting via electrostatic forces, is screened exactly at each
particle [248,84]; see also [12].15 This occurs due to polarization of the atomic electrons by
the external ﬁeld. An atomic EDM cannot be induced in such a case. However, as shown
by Schiﬀ [84], if magnetic or ﬁnite-size eﬀects are taken into account, there is incomplete
shielding, and so atomic EDMs can in principle be measured.

An atomic EDM can be induced from the following P, T -odd mechanisms:
(i) an intrinsic EDM of an electron – the electron EDM can interact with the atomic ﬁeld

15Actually, for moving particles like electrons the average value of the screened ﬁeld is zero. An
explanation is the following: a neutral atom is not accelerated by the homogeneous external ﬁeld.
If a charged particle inside the atom is not accelerated the electric ﬁeld acting on this particle is
zero. Therefore, the EDM of the particle has nothing to interact with, d

= 0.

producing an atomic EDM that is many times larger than the single electron EDM [213];

(ii) a P, T -odd electron-nucleon interaction [249,242];
(iii) an intrinsic EDM of an external nucleon [215,250];
(iv) a P, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction – this interaction can induce P, T -odd nuclear

moments that can greatly exceed the moments of single nucleons [251,165].

The latter two mechanisms (iii),(iv) can be grouped together at the nuclear scale since

they both produce P, T -odd nuclear multipole moments.

One may consider other exotic T -violating mechanisms such as dyon16 vacuum polariza-

tion [252].

There are in fact other mechanisms that can lead to an atomic EDM that are not P, T -
violating at the fundamental level. For example, T -odd, P -even interactions can have P, T -
odd eﬀects due to P -odd radiative corrections (see, e.g., [13]).

In Fig. 22 we present a ﬂowdiagram (slightly modiﬁed from the review Ref. [253]) show-
ing the CP-violating mechanisms at diﬀerent energy scales that induce neutron, atomic,
and molecular EDMs. Read from left to right, it is seen clearly which measurements con-
strain which CP -violating parameters at smaller distances (and which popular CP -violating
models). (Read in the other direction, it is seen which small-distance mechanisms induce
large-distance CP -violating eﬀects.) Calculations are required to relate the CP -violating
parameters at diﬀerent scales. Solid lines indicate the parameters that are most strongly
constrained (induced) by the parameters to the left (right), while dashed lines indicate a
weaker constraint (inducing mechanism).

In this review we focus primarily on atomic EDMs induced by P, T -odd nuclear mo-
ments that originate from P, T -odd nuclear forces, since there have been several recent
developments in this area. We will ﬁrst discuss atomic EDMs induced by the P, T -violating
electron-nucleon interaction in Section VIII D 1 and by the electron EDM in Section VIII D 2.
For the sake of completion, we brieﬂy introduce nuclear P, T -violating moments in Section
VIII D 3 before a comprehensive overview of these moments is given in Section IX.

In this approximation the term containing C P S vanishes.

Notice the similarity between this expression (128) and Eqs. (4), (8). However, here the
matrix element is real (the factor i is placed here to make the operator Hermitian; another
factor of i arises due to the mixing of the upper and lower components of the electron wave
function (121) due to γ5 and γi). Therefore the interaction (128) mixes atomic states of
opposite parity and induces static electric dipole moments in atoms.

Like their P -odd, T -even analogues (4) and (8), the nuclear spin-independent term in
(128) receives coherent contributions from the nucleons inside the nucleus, whereas the
smaller second term, dependent on the nuclear spin, arises from the unpaired nucleons.

Each of the interactions ˆH SP and ˆH T can induce EDMs in paramagnetic atoms. However,
only ˆH T can open up the closed electron shells of diamagnetic atoms and thus induce an
EDM; this term is dependent on the nuclear spin, while the scalar-pseudoscalar term is not.
Therefore, the interaction ˆH SP cannot by itself contribute to EDMs in diamagnetic atoms.
However, by allowing for the hyperﬁne interaction, measurements of EDMs of diamag-
netic atoms can place limits on C SP which are, in fact, as competitive as those obtained
from experiments with paramagnetic atoms. The atomic EDM induced by the P, T -odd
scalar-pseudoscalar electron-nucleus interaction ˆH SP along with the hyperﬁne interaction
ˆHhf arises in the third order of perturbation theory [18],

2. The electron EDM

The best limits on the electron electric dipole moment are derived from measurements of
atomic EDMs. Salpeter ﬁrst noted the possibility of an enhancement of the electron EDM
in atoms through consideration of the metastable 2s state in hydrogen [258].

As noted above, when magnetic eﬀects are considered, the screening of the EDMs in an
atom (Schiﬀ theorem) is lifted [84]. Sandars [213] pointed out that due to relativistic mag-
netic eﬀects, the atomic EDM induced in heavy atoms can be strongly enhanced compared
to the electron EDM inducing it. The value of the atomic EDM compared to the electron
EDM is expressed through an enhancement factor

K = datom/de .

(137)

The enhancement factor K increases with nuclear charge Z faster than Z 3.

We will look brieﬂy at how an electron EDM induces an EDM of an atom as a whole;
for a more detailed consideration we refer the reader to the works [259,214,12,13,260]. As
we mentioned at the beginning of Section VIII A, there are two types of contributions to
an atomic EDM arising from constituent EDMs. For the case of electron EDMs these

are the following: (i) the sum of the intrinsic EDMs of the electrons

mixes the lower components of the wave functions (121). So it is seen that this is a purely
relativistic eﬀect. In heavy atoms the ﬁrst term in Eq. (138) is small compared to the second
and so can be omitted in the calculations.

The ﬁrst analytical formulation of the enhancement factor was performed in Ref. [214].

This simple formula (141) illustrates the dependence of the enhancement factor on Z 3
and on the angular momentum J and can be used to obtain order of magnitude estimates.
It is seen that K is large for high Z and low J.

For atoms with more complex conﬁgurations these formulae are not applicable and nu-

merical calculations of the enhancement factor are required.

As we mentioned earlier, experiments with paramagnetic atoms and molecules are most
sensitive to the electron EDM. The current best limit on the electron EDM comes from the
Tl measurement (123). The sensitivity of atomic thallium to the electron EDM is [261]

There is some sensitivity of diamagnetic systems to the electron EDM [262], al-
though this sensitivity is very weak. The dominant contribution appears in third-order
perturbation theory due to consideration of the hyperﬁne interaction, Eq.
(129) with
ˆH SP replaced with the interaction ˆHe [18].
(The second-order “bare” contribution,
En), is signiﬁcantly smaller and can be neglected

[18].) Another contribution [18] comes from the direct interaction of the nuclear mag-
netic ﬁeld B (arising from the nuclear magnetic moment) with the electron EDM [258],
ˆHP T =
Bi. This latter interaction contributes in second-order, Eq. (120).
The following relation between de and the P, T -odd tensor electron-nucleon interaction has
been obtained [18,12,13],

3. P, T -violating nuclear moments

−

Atomic EDMs can be induced if the nucleus possesses P, T -odd nuclear moments. These
moments arise at the nucleon scale due to a P, T -violating interaction between nucleons or
due to intrinsic nucleon EDMs. The induced nuclear moments can be electric or magnetic.
For example, the following moments violate parity and time-reversal invariance: electric
dipole, magnetic quadrupole, electric octupole. For the electric case, the interaction Hamil-
tonian that mixes opposite parity electron states, and induces an EDM of the atom, is of
the form ˆhP T =
eϕ, where ϕ is the electrostatic potential of the nucleus corresponding to
a P, T -odd charge distribution. In fact, due to Schiﬀ’s theorem [84], there is an additional
screening term which we will look at in Section IX. In the magnetic case Schiﬀ’s theorem is
not valid, and the interaction Hamiltonian of a relativistic electron with the vector potential
A corresponding to a P, T -odd current distribution is simply ˆhP T = eα
A. See formula
(120).

The operator ˆhP T has electronic and nuclear components. While the overall operator ˆhP T
is a scalar, the electronic and nuclear operators can be of any (equal) rank. Accordingly, the
triangle rule for addition of angular momenta imposes restrictions on the angular momenta
of the electron and nuclear states for non-zero matrix elements. For example, the electron
interaction with the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment cannot mix s and p1/2 electron
j1 + j2. Similarly, a static magnetic quadrupole
states, since we must have

moments are induced by P, T -violating mechanisms at the nucleon scale. Enhancement
mechanisms for nuclear moments are reviewed in Section IX D. Finally, in Section IX E we
look at calculations of atomic EDMs induced by nuclear moments.

A. Electric moments; the Schiﬀ moment

When considering the P, T -odd electric moments of the nucleus, we must take note of an
important screening phenomenon - the Schiﬀ theorem (we mentioned this at the beginning

58

of Section VIII D). The electron screening is taken into account by using the following
(screened) electrostatic potential of the nucleus (for a derivation, see, e.g., [274]):

is the P, T -odd nuclear EDM.17

We are interested in the contributions of the ﬁrst and second terms to ϕ that are ﬁrst
order in the P, T -odd interaction. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of Eq. (148) is
P, T -odd if the charge density is distorted due to a P, T -odd interaction. The density in the
second term can be considered spherical, since the nuclear EDM is P, T -violating (it arises
due to a P, T -violating component of the density in Eq. (149)).

If we consider the nucleus to be point-like, then we can perform a multipole expansion of
the potential (148) in terms of r/R. According to Schiﬀ’s theorem, the nuclear electrostatic
potential is screened by atomic electrons such that the dominant nuclear P, T -odd moment,
the nuclear EDM, of a point-like nucleus cannot generate an atomic EDM. It is easy to see
this from Eq. (148):

ϕ(3) = ϕoctupole + ϕSchiﬀ ,

17The screening term appears as a result of a unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian which
does not change the linear Stark shift. For exact atomic wave functions the result for the atomic
EDM must be the same with and without the screening term. However, in real (approximate)
calculations inclusion of the screening term is a must.

Because the octupole moment Oijk carries 3 units of angular momentum it can only

However, for these moments to induce an atomic EDM they must satisfy electronic
angular momentum requirements. Due to the higher rank of the octupole moment it mixes
electronic states of higher angular momentum than the Schiﬀ moment. This means that the
atomic EDM induced by the octupole moment is smaller than that induced by the Schiﬀ
moment because the wave functions of electrons with higher angular momentum penetrate
the vicinity of the nucleus less due to the greater centrifugal barrier. The lowest value for
the angular momentum of the electrons that can induce an atomic EDM due to mixing by
the octupole moment is j = 3/2. [The conditions imposed on the allowed electronic angular
j1 + j2 and that allowed
momentum for mixing by the octupole moment is
j1 + j2, so the conditions for inducing an
1
by the electric dipole mixing is
3.] This means that s states cannot contribute
atomic EDM are
to the EDM produced by the electric octupole moment, so that in fact the octupole moment
of the Cs nucleus cannot induce an atomic EDM in Cs in the ground state, as this state
corresponds to a conﬁguration with a single electron in an s-state above closed shells. Static
nuclear octupole moments and the atomic EDMs they induce have been considered in detail
in Ref. [275]. The EDMs they induce in atoms are very small, so we will consider them no
further.

It is therefore obvious that the Schiﬀ moment is the only P, T -odd moment that induces
an EDM in atoms with closed electron subshells such as Xe and Hg. (The nuclear magnetic
quadrupole moment, which will be discussed in the next section, cannot induce an atomic
EDM in systems with zero electron angular momentum, since there is no magnetic ﬁeld
of the electrons for the MQM to interact with. The same conclusion also follows from the
triangle rule applied to Eq. (120).) In fact, all the atoms for which EDM measurements have

Let us consider the form of the atomic EDM (120) induced by the interaction of electrons

A more accurate treatment requires the calculation of a new nuclear characteristic which

invariance.

1. The spin hedgehog

In a spherically symmetric system the P, T -odd interaction induces a “spin-hedgehog”
r [277,278]. The P, T -
whereby the spin density is proportional to the radial vector, σ
odd nucleon-nucleon interaction (leading to the perturbed wave functions (177), see below)
produces the following distributions of the spins for protons and neutrons in the nucleus,

∝

σp(r) = ξp∇ρp(r) ,

σn(r) = ξn∇ρn(r) ,

2. This collective spin distribution, however,
the unperturbed nuclear density ρ =
|
∇
produces no current
and hence no magnetic ﬁeld
[278]. One may think that because the spin-hedgehog has no magnetic ﬁeld it produces no
eﬀects. This is not the case. The spin-dependent part of the strong interaction is sensitive
to this spin structure. It reduces the constants of the P, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction:
for the case of an external proton interacting with the spin-hedgehog, ηp →
ηp/1.5, while for
ηn/1.8 [278,194]. A distorted spin hedgehog in deformed nuclei produces a
a neutron, ηn →
collective magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld (see Section IX D 2).

Note that the spin-hedgehog is not speciﬁc to nuclei. For example, the P, T -odd electron-
nucleon interaction (Section VIII D 1) mixes atomic states of opposite parity and induces a
spin-hedgehog of the atom [277]; see, e.g., [12,13] for details.

C. What mechanisms induce P, T -odd nuclear moments at the nucleon scale?

P, T -odd nuclear moments can arise due to an intrinsic EDM of an external nucleon or
due to P, T -odd nuclear forces. The P, T -odd nuclear forces induce larger nuclear moments
than a single nucleon EDM (Section IX C 3). This is what makes atomic experiments so
competitive compared to neutron experiments in probing CP -violation in the hadron sector.
As we will see in Section X, atomic experiments are more sensitive than neutron experiments
to many underlying CP -violating mechanisms.

1. The P, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction

The P, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction is the dominating nuclear mechanism inducing

atomic EDMs in diamagnetic atoms and molecules.

The P, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction, to ﬁrst-order in the velocities p/m, can be

presented as [165]

a and b. The dimensionless constants ηab and η′ab characterize the strength of the P, T -odd
nuclear interaction (experiments on EDMs are aimed to measure these constants).

If we consider the P, T -odd interaction between a single unpaired nucleon and a heavy
spherical core, then we can average the two-particle interaction (171) over the core nucleons
to obtain the eﬀective single-particle P, T -odd interaction between the nucleon and core

Here it has been assumed that the proton and neutron densities are proportional to the total
nuclear density ρA(r); the dimensionless constant

The moments we have discussed so far are produced by a valence nucleon. In the work
[279] it was shown that core nucleons make a contribution to P, T -odd moments that is
comparable to that of a valence nucleon.

Of particular interest is 199Hg, which gives the best limit on the nuclear Schiﬀ moment.
In the 199Hg nucleus the unpaired nucleon is a neutron. It doesn’t contribute to the Schiﬀ
moment directly (see Eq. (180)). The nuclear Schiﬀ moment arises due to the polarization of
the protons of the core by the P, T -odd ﬁeld of the external neutron. (The charge distribution
must be distorted to give a P, T -odd correction to the charge density.) The strength of the
P, T -odd interaction is deﬁned by the parameter ηnp. A numerical calculation of the Schiﬀ
moment for 199Hg in the Woods-Saxon potential with spin-orbit interaction gives [280,279]

An analytical treatment of the electron relativistic corrections to the Schiﬀ moment (that

199Hg Schiﬀ moment has been performed recently in the work [281]. A ﬁnite-range P, T -odd

2. The external nucleon EDM

Even though the nucleon-nucleon interaction may be more eﬀective in inducing nuclear
P, T -odd moments and hence atomic EDMs, measurements of nucleon EDMs are interesting
in their own right. Also, nucleon EDMs measured from atomic experiments may be compared
to those from direct measurements. Currently, the limit on the neutron EDM from the Hg
measurement (124) is competitive with those from direct neutron EDM searches (125); see
Tables XIX,XX. Here we will merely quote the results of the work [250] for the nuclear
Schiﬀ and magnetic quadrupole moments induced by a single unpaired nucleon (neutron or
proton) with an intrinsic EDM dn,p,

In the simple shell model the unpaired neutron in the 199Hg nucleus carries the nuclear

A numerical calculation of the nuclear Schiﬀ moment of 199Hg induced by neutron and
proton EDMs has recently been performed, with core polarization accounted for in the RPA
approximation [286]. The result is [286]

S(199Hg) = (1.9 dn + 0.2 dp) fm2 .

(See [286] for the discussion of uncertainty.)

3. Comparison of the size of nuclear moments induced by the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the
nucleon EDM

Here we consider the enhancement of the nuclear EDM induced by P, T -odd nuclear
forces compared to that induced by an external valence nucleon using the simple one-boson
exchange model, following [280,279,287]. The largest contribution to the constant η is prob-
ably given by the lightest π0-meson,

D. Nuclear enhancement mechanisms

So far we have considered P, T -odd nuclear moments in spherical nuclei. However, in
non-spherical nuclei there is the possibility of enhancement due to (i) the presence of a
low-lying level with opposite parity and the same angular momentum with respect to the
ground state; and (ii) collective eﬀects.

1. Close-level enhancement

It is known that nuclei with non-spherical symmetry have close levels of opposite parity.
It was pointed out in Ref. [289] that due to the existence of a close level of opposite parity
with the same angular momentum as the ground state, the nuclear EDM can be enhanced;
calculations of enhanced EDMs and MQMs were performed in [251], Schiﬀ moments in [165].
In the frozen frame, the contribution to the z-components of the electric dipole, Schiﬀ, and
magnetic quadrupole nuclear moments in the ground state Ω due to the close opposite parity
state ¯Ω is

where T = dz, Sz, Mzz. The magnetic quadrupole moment in heavy stable nuclei can be
enhanced by an order of magnitude due to the “close level” mechanism, while for the electric
dipole and Schiﬀ moments this enhancement hardly exceeds
10 [165]. However, this
“close-level” enhancement is not regular: it gives contributions to P, T -odd moments with
diﬀerent magnitudes and signs even in the “nearest” nuclei, the results are unstable.18

∼

2. Collective enhancement

While the “close-level” mechanism enhances the contribution of the external nucleon to
the P, T -odd nuclear moments, there can also be a “collective” enhancement of the nuclear
moments that occurs due to the contribution of many nucleons. In the work [278] it was

shown that a collective magnetic quadrupole moment can be produced in deformed nuclei
by P, T -odd nuclear forces. Unlike the close-level enhancement, this collective enhancement
is regular: in deformed nuclei about A2/3 nucleons belong to open shells that contribute to
the MQM. The P, T -odd nuclear forces create a spin hedgehog [Eq. (170)] as in the case of
spherical nuclei (Section IX B 1), however in the deformed case there is a non-zero magnetic
ﬁeld associated with it. The MQM of a deformed nucleus (in the rotating frame) can
basically be calculated as a summation of the single-particle MQMs (181) of all nucleons
(181,182), that spin-orbit pairs I = l + 1/2 and
in the open shells. Notice, from Eqs.
I = l
1/2 make contributions to the collective MQM of opposite sign. A suﬃciently large
spin-orbit splitting is therefore required to avoid cancellation, and this is satisﬁed in nuclei.
This collective mechanism gives an order of magnitude enhancement of the nuclear MQM
in deformed nuclei compared to spherical nuclei.

−

3. Octupole deformation; collective Schiﬀ moments

We will now move on to the collective P, T -odd nuclear moments produced by P, T -odd
nuclear forces that arise in nuclei with static octupole deformation [290,274,275]. There is an
enhancement of these collective moments, compared to single-particle nuclear moments, due
to the collective nature of the intrinsic moments and the small energy separation between
members of parity doublets. This enhancement can be as large as 1000 times.

Static octupole deformation in the ground state has been demonstrated to exist in nuclei
in the regions Ra-Th and Ba-Sm. It produces eﬀects such as parity doublets, large dipole
and octupole moments in the intrinsic frame of reference and enhanced electric dipole and
octupole transitions; see the review Ref. [291].

While it has been shown that the Schiﬀ and electric dipole and octupole moments are
enhanced in nuclei with octupole deformation, we will focus our attention on the nuclear
Schiﬀ moment (the EDM is not of direct interest, in atoms it is screened by atomic electrons;
also, the atomic EDM induced by the electric octupole moment is small since it does not
mix s and p electron orbitals.)

The mechanism generating collective P, T -odd moments is the following. In the “frozen”
body frame collective moments can exist without any P, T -violation. However, the nucleus
rotates, and this makes the expectation value of these moments vanish in the laboratory
frame if there is no P, T -violation. (For example, the intrinsic Schiﬀ moment is directed along
the nuclear axis, Sintr = Sintrn, and in the laboratory frame the only possible correlation
I violates parity and time reversal invariance.) The P, T -odd nuclear forces mix

See Table XVII for calculations [274] of Schiﬀ moments in nuclei assuming static octupole
deformation. An attractive candidate for P, T -odd studies is radium, and recently several
laboratories around the world have considered performing EDM experiments with it. As
well as the possibility for a large Schiﬀ moment, the atomic EDM is large due to high Z.
And if measurements can be performed for metastable atomic states, further enhancement
can occur due to the presence of close opposite parity levels [162,163]. A Woods-Saxon
calculation for the Schiﬀ moment of 225Ra gives [274]

was found to be suppressed by between 1.5 and 3 times due to suppression of the matrix

radium Schiﬀ moment is several hundred times larger.

a recent work [295] Schiﬀ moments of nuclei with soft octupole vibrations were calculated

of heavy nuclei can have large collective Schiﬀ moments.

The eﬀect of static octupole deformation on the size of the single-particle MQM was
considered in [275]. It was found that generally there is no signiﬁcant enhancement due to
this mechanism.

There are several experiments in preparation aimed to detect EDMs of heavy atoms with

deformed nuclei; see Section X.

As we have discussed, the Schiﬀ moment can be induced from a number of P, T -violating
mechanisms: due to a P, T -violating nucleon-nucleon interaction or due to a static EDM of
an unpaired nucleon. The limit on ηnp from Eqs. (206,184) is

Using instead the recent calculation (190) will change the limits on dn and dp only slightly.
The result (185) suggests that the limits on the isoscalar and isotensor P, T -odd couplings
may be substantially weaker than those that would follow from Eq. (207) using Eq. (184).

X. CURRENT LIMITS ON FUNDAMENTAL P, T -VIOLATING PARAMETERS
AND PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT

A. Summary of limits

EDM measurements have already excluded several models of CP -violation and the pa-
rameter space of currently popular models is strongly constrained. In this review we will not
discuss the sensitivities of the various EDM measurements to diﬀerent CP -violating models;
for such an analysis, see, e.g., the reviews [296,253,260] and the book [13]. The problem is
that in new theories there are many free parameters, and this gives a whole range of possible
values for CP -violating eﬀects. Here we compare the sensitivities of diﬀerent measurements
to fundamental CP -violating interactions by placing limits on phenomenological parameters.
In Tables XIX,XX we present the best limits on fundamental P, T -violating parameters
extracted from EDM measurements in atoms, molecules, and neutrons. In previous sections
we presented limits on hadronic and semi-leptonic CP -violating parameters at the nucleon
scale [nucleon EDMs, Eqs. (125,208,209); nucleon-nucleon interaction, Eqs. (207); electron-
nucleon interaction, Eqs. (132,133,136)] and in the leptonic sector directly on the electron
EDM [Eq. (143)]. These are summarized in Table XIX. Here we constrain CP -violation at
the quark scale from limits at the nucleon scale. Fig. 22 shows which of these parameters
are related.

We will begin with a discussion of limits on CP -violating parameters in the hadronic
sector. Currently, the best limits on the neutron EDM come from direct neutron measure-
ments (125), and the limit from mercury is not far behind (208). The best proton EDM limit
comes from mercury (209). Constraints on nucleon EDMs constrain the following param-
eters at the quark level: quark EDMs, chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) [CEDMs
are analogous to quark EDMs, though with the external electromagnetic ﬁeld replaced by a
gluonic ﬁeld], P, T -odd quark-quark four-fermion interactions, the QCD phase deﬁning the
strength of the term G ˜G, and another parameter deﬁning the strength of the term GG ˜G [in
all models of CP violation considered this parameter is not the dominating mechanism in-
ducing neutron EDMs [302], so we will not discuss it further]. Limits on nucleon EDMs can
also constrain P, T -odd lepton-quark four-fermion interactions which induce quark EDMs
at the one-loop level [303]; however, the limits involving light quarks are weaker than those
obtained at tree-level from atomic measurements.

We use the following calculations to relate the nucleon and quark parameters, with
the corresponding limits presented in Table XX. The limit on the QCD θ term is ar-
16 ¯θe cm. To re-
rived at using the relation obtained in Ref.
late dn to the quark CEDMs ˜dq and quark EDMs dq we use the recent calculation
[300], dn = (1

quark interactions we use the phenomenological parameters [297,298,13] deﬁned by the
Hamiltonian ˆhqq = G

From the limit on the P, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction η from mercury follows

¯gπN N | ≈

(Ref. [288]) is used to place a constraint on the QCD θ term, tighter than those
obtained from direct neutron measurements. Limits on CEDMs of quarks can be obtained
from the limit on ¯gπN N . We use the calculation of Ref. [299], ¯gπN N = 2( ˜du −
14cm).
Again, this limit is better than those from the neutron. Constraints on the phenomenological
P, T -odd quark-quark interactions deﬁned above are obtained from the constraints on ¯gπN N ,

Until this point we have not mentioned the P, T -odd electron-electron interaction, ˆhee =

s(¯eiγ5e)(¯ee). This interaction induces atomic EDMs smaller than those induced by the
electron-nucleon interaction. It does not beneﬁt from two enhancement factors present in
the latter interaction: the relativistic factor arising from the outer electrons being in the
nuclear vicinity; and the interaction with A nucleons (rather than two K-shell electrons in
the former interaction); see Ref. [13].

The limit on the electron EDM can be reduced to limits on the P, T -odd electron-quark
interaction [303] and on the electron-electron interaction [13] that are competitive with those
obtained at tree level. However, we do not include these into our table.

In relating the P, T -odd parameters at the nucleon and quark levels we used the most
recent calculations available. For references to other calculations, please see, e.g., the review
[253] and book [13].

B. Ongoing/future EDM experiments in atoms, solids, and diatomic molecules

There is a new generation of experiments in preparation aimed to measure EDMs of
ions in solids (gadolinium gallium garnet and gadolinium iron garnet) [228,229]. Here it is
expected that the sensitivity to T -violating eﬀects (in particular, the electron EDM) will be
improved by several orders of magnitude. The solid-state nature of the problem complicates
the calculations required for interpretation of the measurements. A series of calculations
have been performed in [304].

One of the primary goals of the TRIµP facility under construction at Groningen is
to measure permanent EDMs of radioactive atoms and ions, in particular Ra (see, e.g.,

73

[140]). Groups at Yale, Argonne, and Los Alamos are also considering performing EDM
experiments with Ra and Rn. These atoms can have very large EDMs due to their high
Z and the presence of nuclear (static/vibrational) octupole deformation (Section IX D 3).
Also, metastable atomic states of Ra have close levels of opposite parity, and this can be
exploited to obtain an enhanced EDM eﬀect [162,163].

EDM experiments with both paramagnetic and diamagnetic diatomic molecules are un-
derway. The ﬁrst EDM experiment with paramagnetic molecules (YbF) was performed
recently at the University of Sussex [226], and while the result gave a looser bound on the
electron EDM than the Tl experiment [11], a substantial improvement in the result is ex-
pected. Experiments with PbO excited to the metastable a(1) state have begun at Yale
[270].

XI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Exciting developments in violations of fundamental symmetries are expected in the next
few years. Improved EDM measurements underway, including the new generation of exper-
iments in solids, diatomic molecules, and radioactive atoms, are expected to yield limits on
electric dipole moments that are several orders of magnitude better than the current ones.
Or perhaps an EDM will be unambiguously detected? Popular models such as supersymme-
try will be put to the test. Improved precision tests of parity violation in atoms in a single
isotope and in a chain of isotopes will provide crucial tests of physics beyond the standard
model complementary to each other and to other electroweak tests. New measurements of
the nuclear anapole moment are anticipated, and they will have important consequences for
the theory of parity violating nuclear forces.

aThe values for the PNC amplitudes for Cs [9] and for Tl 6P1/2 −
6P3/2 [55] include corrections
beyond the other calculations.
In particular, for Cs the contributions of the Breit interaction
and vacuum polarization due to the strong nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld are included. For Tl the Breit
interaction is also included. The remaining corrections for Cs and Tl are discussed in detail in
Sections V,VI, respectively. These corrections would be inside the error bars for the other atoms
and transitions in the table.

cContributions of the valence nucleon carried out in diﬀerent potentials: Eq.

eThis value is comprised of a valence nucleon and core contribution. The valence proton gives
1.4ηpn while the core contribution is 1.23ηpp, in the units in the
a contribution of
table. The diﬀerence between the valence contributions of the works [280,279] and [165] is due to
a diﬀerence in the potentials used; remember that in 203,205Tl the Schiﬀ moment is very sensitive
to the potential, see Eq. (183).

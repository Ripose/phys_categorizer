Abstract

This work is aimed at the multiconﬁgurational Hartree-Fock calculations of the Er ionization

energy. Authors have used the ATSP MCHF version in which there are new codes for calculation
of spin-angular parts written on the basis of the methodology Gaigalas, Rudzikas and Froese

Fischer [4, 5], based on the second quantization in coupled tensorial form, the angular momen-
tum theory in 3 spaces (orbital, spin and quasispin) and graphical technique of spin-angular
integrations. They allow the study of conﬁgurations with open f -shells without any restrictions
and lead to fairly accurate values of spectroscopic data.

INTRODUCTION

There is considerable interest in understanding the physics and chemistry of heavy atoms and

ions. The main problem in investigation of such systems is their complexity, caused by the large

number of electrons and the importance of relativistic eﬀects. Therefore the detailed description

of heavy atoms and ions requires the correct treatment of correlation eﬀects as well as relativistic

description of the system. The correlation eﬀects in the theory of many-electron atoms are treated
mainly by the two methods: conﬁguration superposition (CI) and multiconﬁgurational Hartree-
Fock (MCHF). Relativistic eﬀects are usually included adding the relativistic corrections to the

non-relativistic Hamiltonian (for example, the Breit-Pauli approximation), or using relativistic two

component wave functions and relativistic Hamiltonian (for example, the Breit approximation) [1].

The complete and rigorous treatment of both relativistic and correlation eﬀects for heavy atoms

and ions is, unfortunately, practically outside of today’s computational possibilities.

Nevertheless, we expect that in case of Er relativistic eﬀects as well as correlation eﬀects between

the electrons of ’inner shells’ (core-core correlations) are the same for the neutral atom and ion.
We assume that these eﬀects (corresponding energies) cancel each other in calculation of ionization
energy (IE). Only correlation between ’outer’ (valence) electrons gives signiﬁcant contribution to

IE. And then it may be possible to get quite accurate values of ionization energies taking into

account of them by MCHF approach.

This work is aimed at checking this assumption. For this purpose we perform MCHF calculations

using the ATSP MCHF [2, 3] version in which there are new codes for calculation of spin-angular

parts written on the basis of the methodology Gaigalas, Rudzikas and Froese Fischer [4, 5], based

on the second quantization in coupled tonsorial form, the angular momentum theory in 3 spaces

(orbital, spin and quasispin) and graphical technique of spin-angular integrations. They allow the
study of conﬁgurations with open f -shells without any restrictions.

2 APPROACH

Ionization energy we deﬁne as IE = Eion − Eg, where Eg and Eion are the ground state energies
of neutral and singly ionized atom correspondingly. The ground state of neutral Er is

We calculate the ground state energies making use of the Hamiltonian

2.2 MCHF

For calculation of ionization energy we used MCHF method. In this approach, the wave function is
expressed as a linear combination of conﬁguration state functions (CSFs) which are antisymmetrized
products of one-electron spin-orbitals. A set of orbitals, or active set (AS), determines the set of
all possible CSFs or the complete active space (CAS) for MCHF calculation. The size of the latter

grows rapidly with the number of electrons and also with the size of the orbital AS. Most MCHF
expansions are therefore limited to a restricted active space (RAS) [2]. No ’relaxation’ eﬀects were

included.

3 RAS construction

Large scale systematic MCHF calculations of IE of lanthanides has not been done yet. Therefore,
following the methodology of [2], it is important to investigate the structure of Er and Er+ ground
conﬁgurations, to impose the core and valence shells and to evaluate valence–valence (VV), core–
valence (CV) and core–core (CC) correlations.

It is always a question when we can assume that a subshell is a part of the core, and when it should

be treated as a valence shell. The answer is not trivial even for boron like ions, and in our case it
is even more complicated because of complexity of conﬁgurations of Er and Er+, and our attempt
is to take care of the correlation eﬀects that do not cancel each other between ion and atom.

Because we treat IE in non-relativistic approach, and in the neighbourhood of the ground level

there are no levels with the same L, S, J values, methodics based on the consideration of energy

spectra described in [2] could not be straightforward adapted to impose core and valence shells in

Therefore in this chapter we will study some possibilities of RAS construction.

our case.

3.1 HF calculations

First insight into the structure of Er and Er+ ground states we can get from the Hartree-Fock (HF)
calculations. The resultant ground state energies and mean distances of nl radial functions are

presented in TABLE I.
Resultant energies are in agreement with those presented in [6]. The important note is that 6s
function is much more remote frome the nucleus than the ones of 5s, 5p and 4f . And the open 4f
shell is closer to the nucleus than the 5s and 5p. Therefore, we have a diﬃculty in treatment of

’outer’ electrons: usually as outer (valence) shells the open ones are considered, but sometimes the

closed shells are included too [2]. For light atoms these shells are spartially ’outer’.

3.2 CORE I

In this case we use the core

and the 4f , 6s we treat as valence shells. The 4f shell we treat as valence shell because it is
open and 6s because the corresponding radial function in much more remote from the nucleus than

others. This approach is close to the advices given in [2].

The basis for the MCHF expansion was formed using the CSF’s of conﬁgurations made of single
and double (S, D) excitations from the valence shells to some destination set. There were two types

of destination sets used:

a = {5d, 5f, 5g, 6p, 6d} ,

b = a + {6f, 6g, 6h, 7s, 7p, 7d} .

(11)

(12)

Further on we denote the basis as core with subscript of destination set. For example, Ia denotes
the basis, consisting of CSF’s of conﬁgurations, made by S, D excitations from 4f 126s2 for Er and
4f 126s1 for Er+ to the destination set ’a’ and cores [Xe]. The numbers of CSFs in the bases are
presented in TABLE II.
The weight for the main CSF was found to be 0.977 for Ia (and similar for Ib). This value is close
to that (0.949) found by CI method [7]. The mean distances of radial functions from the nucleus
are found to be smaller than for HF calculations. For example <r>4f = 0.752 a.u. for Ia (0.748
a.u. for Ib) and <r>6s = 4.550 a.u. for Ia (4.534 a.u. for Ib).

3.3 CORES II, III

In this case, we treat as valence shell only 6s, because of its spatial location. We expect this
strategy to be more eﬃcient for the calculations of 6s ionization energy because as we can see from
HF calculations mean distance of 4f radial functions is not much diﬀerent for Er and Er+. As a
cores we use
II. [Xe]4f 12 with not ﬁxed term
and
III. [Xe]4f 12 with ﬁxed term 3H.
There were ﬁve types of destination sets used with these cores:

(11) and (12) as for core I and three more

c = b + {7f, 7g, 7h, 7i, 8s, 8p, 8d} ,

d = c + {8f, 8g, 8h, 8i, 8k, 9s, 9p, 9d} ,

e = d + {9f, 9g, 9h, 9i, 9k, 9l, 10s, 10p, 10d} .

(13)

(14)

(15)

As we can see from TABLE II, the basis formed with the same destination sets is the biggest for

the core I, the medium for core II and the smallest for core III.

The weights of main CSFs in MCHF expansions are about 0.960 – 0.980 for all bases with cores
II, III. The mean distance from the nucleus for 6s radial function is greater than the one obtained
from HF calculations but smaller than obtained using bases with core I. For example, <r>6s =
4.560 a.u. for IIIa, 4.564 a.u. for IIIb,d,e.

6s IONIZATION ENERGY

The results of MCHF calculations are presented in TABLE II.
For the bases obtained using II, III cores in non-relativistic approach, we get that increasing

destination set the value of IE decreases until certain value (in our case 5.792 eV). This value

should be considered as the result of ’frozen core’ method. The result that for certain core using

smaller (for example ’a’) destination set and correspondingly smaller basis we obtain the IE value

closer to experimental one is treated by us as casual, because in smaller destination set (basis) we

account for smaller part of valence correlations or (and) take into account it with diﬀerent precision
for Er and Er+.

Adding the relativistic corrections raise the value of IE up to 5.877 eV. This value is fairly close to

the experimental one 6.108 eV (the error is less than 4%).

Using core I the corresponding basis is 10 times larger than the one of II (or about 40 times

larger than formed using core III). Nevertheless, the results obtained using these bases are much
worse. For example, in non-relativistic approach IE value for the Ib basis is 5.572 eV, whereas the
corresponding value for the Ib is 5.796 eV. It is due to the fact that basis formed using destination
set ’b’ for the core I is not enough to account for the correlation eﬀects of 4f –electrons, which,
represented in full, cancels between Er and Er+. Relativistic corrections improve the value of IE,
but it is still worse than those obtained using cores II, III. Of course, the results obtained using
core I could be improved using larger bases (and should overtake the ones obtained using II, III

cores), but at present it is unreachable because of our computational resources.

So, we recomend to use core III for the calculations of IE. In this case it is possible to get quite

good value of IE taking into account VV (6s–6s) correlations only. The inclusion of CV4f and CC4f
correlations requires much more computational resources and with the present ones doesn’t lead to

the better result.

And ﬁnally, let us compare our results with the previous calculations of IE, where correlation eﬀects

were treated using CI method [7].
The authors used well-temped Gaussian type functions (GTF’s) and augmented diﬀuse p–, d– and
f –functions to describe the 6s–6s, 6s–4f and 6s–5d electron correlations as well as 8g and 7h to
describe the angular correlation eﬀects. The total number of GTF’s was (29s, 25p, 22d, 17f, 8g, 7h).

Since authors could not perform full single- and single-double excitation conﬁguration interaction

(SDCI), important CSF’s were selected by performing the second order perturbation calculations,

reducing number of CSF’s. They performed so-called natural orbital iterations to obtain compact

CI expansions for the ground state as well as for the ionized state. The error of the correlation

energies due to unselected CSF’s was estimated to be 0.001 a.u. and the error in the IE was

estimated to be less than 0.05 eV. As one can see from the TABLE II, the result of CI calculation

was 5.077 eV, and the one with Davidson correction [8] CIQ 5.250 eV. The result with estimated
relativistic eﬀects is 5.58 eV.

Comparing the results [7] with ours, (5.792 eV for non-relativistic value of IE), we can see that it
is possible to obtain much better value of IE only accounting for the valence (6s–6s) correlation,

whereas incomplete inclusion of correlation eﬀects of inner shells just disimproves results.

5 CONCLUSION

For the calculations of Er ionization energy the most eﬃcient strategy is to use the MCHF ex-
pansions with frozen core [Xe]4f 12 3H and single, double excitations from (6s). CV4f and CC4f
correlations are not important in this case.

Our results on erbium are more accurate than data found using the Davidson CI+Q method [8]
and adding the relativistic corrections [7].

8

The results obtained show that if the correlation eﬀects of inner shells cancel each other between

atom and ion, then it is possible to get quite accurate data by MCHF method accounting for

correlation eﬀects of outer electrons only. And this assumption takes place in the case of Er

The results demonstrate the ability of the approach by Gaigalas et al.[4, 5] to obtain fairly accurate
data for heavy atoms and ions, having open f -shells.

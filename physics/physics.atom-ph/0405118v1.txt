Abstract

The current status of the determination of corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground

state in hydrogen is considered. Improved calculations are provided taking into account the most

recent value for the proton charge radius. Comparing experimental data with predictions for the

hyperﬁne splitting, the Zemach radius of the proton is deduced to be 1.047(19) fm. Employing

an exponential parametrization for the electromagnetic form factors we determine the magnetic

radius of the proton to be 0.759(39) fm. Both values are compared with the corresponding ones

derived from the data obtained in electron-proton scattering experiments.

INTRODUCTION

High-precision measurements and calculations of energy spectra of hydrogen-like atoms

provide tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED) with very high precision (see [1, 2, 3, 4] and

references therein). In some cases, the current accuracy of QED calculations exceeds those

of the known values of fundamental physical constants. For instance, recent measurements

and calculations of the g-factor of hydrogen-like carbon and oxygen have provided the basis

for a new determination of the electron mass (see [5] and references therein). Measurements

of the Lamb shift in hydrogen, combined with corresponding calculations, have facilitated

to determine the Rydberg constant and to deduce an improved value for the proton charge

radius [6, 7, 8, 9].

The relative experimental accuracy of the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting in hydrogen is
better than 10−12 [10]. The error associated with the QED corrections to the hyperﬁne split-
ting is estimated to contribute on the level 10−9. The major theoretical uncertainty arises

from nuclear structure-dependent contributions. The most important structure-dependent

term is the proton-size correction, which is determined exclusively by the spatial distribu-

tions of the charge and the magnetic moment of the proton. It contributes on the relative
level 10−5. Assuming that all other theoretical corrections are accurately known, one can

determine the proton-size contribution by comparing theoretical and experimental values

for the hyperﬁne splitting in hydrogen. The major goal of the present paper is to determine

the Zemach and the magnetic radius of the proton by such a comparison.

In Sec. II, we consider various theoretical contributions to the hyperﬁne splitting and

derive the proton-size correction comparing theory and experiment. In Sec. III, we reﬁne

the value of the proton-size correction by recalculating some of these contributions and

determine the magnetic radius of the proton, employing an exponential parametrization for

the electric and magnetic form factors. Recalculation of the recoil correction has improved

the value of the Zemach radius in comparison with the previous result obtained in [11]. In

Sec. IV, the results obtained are compared with corresponding data derived from elastic

electron-proton scattering experiments [12, 13].

The relativistic units ¯h = c = 1 are used throughout the paper.

II. HYPERFINE SPLITTING IN HYDROGEN

The hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state in hydrogen can be written in the form

∆Etheor = EF(1 + δDirac + δQED + δstructure) ,

where EF is the Fermi energy [14]

EF =

3

α(αZ)3 m2

em2
p
(me + mp)3 µp ,

µp is the magnetic dipole moment of the proton, me and mp are the electron and proton
mass, respectively. The relativistic correction δDirac can easily be obtained from the Dirac

equation [15]:

δDirac =

(αZ)2 +

(αZ)4 + ... .

Here and in what follows we keep the nuclear charge number Z to separate the relativistic

and radiative corrections. For recent achievements in calculations of the radiative correction

δQED we refer to Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The uncertainty of δQED is mainly determined

by uncalculated terms of order α3(αZ) and by errors associated with some of the calculated

terms. The structure-dependent correction δstructure is usually expressed as the sum

δstructure = δpol + δµvp + δhvp + δweak + δrigid .

(4)

The part associated with intrinsic proton dynamics (polarizability) δpol has been recently

evaluated in [22] employing experimental and theoretical results for the structure functions

of polarized protons. The correction due to muonic vacuum-polarization δµvp has been

obtained in [23], while the hadronic vacuum-polarization contribution δhvp was evaluated in

[24, 25]. For the weak interaction term δweak we refer to Refs. [26, 27]. Values for all these

corrections together with corresponding uncertainties are presented in Table I. The Fermi

energy EF is evaluated employing the values for the fundamental constants tabulated in [6].

Now let us turn to the term δrigid, which is determined by electric and magnetic form

factors of the proton. This quantity can be decomposed into two parts: δrigid = δps +

δrecoil, where δps represents the proton-size correction and δrecoil is associated with recoil

eﬀects. Calculations of the dominant contribution (relative order (αZ)me/mp) to the recoil

correction have a long history (see [28] and references therein). The contribution of the

3

order (αZ)2me/mp has been ﬁrst derived in [28], while the radiative-recoil correction has

been obtained in [23]. It is suﬃcient to account for the structure dependence of the recoil

correction only in the leading term. We have recalculated the integrals derived in [28]

with the new proton charge radius hr2i1/2

e = 0.895(18) fm [12] and with the same value for

the magnetic radius of the proton. The total recoil correction turns out to be 5.86 ppm.

Accordingly, the proton-size correction δps is given by

δps = ∆Eexp/EF − 1 − δDirac − δQED − δrecoil − δpol − δµvp − δhvp − δweak .

(5)

This equation yields the value δps = −40.0(7) × 10−6. The next section is devoted to the

deduction of the magnetic radius of the proton from the proton-size correction.

III. MAGNETIC RADIUS OF THE PROTON

The proton-size correction has been ﬁrst evaluated in the non-relativistic limit by Zemach

[29]:

deﬁnes the Zemach radius of the proton. Here ρe(r) and ρm(r) denote the nuclear charge and

magnetization distribution, respectively, where both densities are normalized to unity. The

quantities Ge/m(q) represent the electric and magnetic form factor, respectively. In a ﬁrst

step we can approximate the proton-size correction by the Zemach formula. Then one can

easily ﬁnd the Zemach radius Rp = 1.059 fm. It is well known that to good approximation

the proton charge and magnetization distributions are described by an exponential model

However, in order to estimate the error associated with such a model we also modify slightly

the exponential distribution by adding about 10% of a Gaussian distribution

The parameters RE and RG are ﬁtted such as to reproduce the experimental value of the root-
mean-square radius. For the charge radius of the proton we take the value hr2i1/2

e = 0.895(18)

fm [12] obtained from the data of electron-proton scattering experiments. Fixing the charge

radius we ﬁt the magnetic radius such as to reproduce the Zemach radius. As the result we

ﬁnd a preliminary magnetic radius of the proton: hr2i1/2

m = 0.779 fm. The error due to the

model dependence is estimated to be on the level of about 0.8%.

In a second step we account for corrections to the Zemach formula

δps = δZemach + δradiative + δrelativistic ,

(10)

where δradiative is the radiative structure-dependent correction obtained in [23] and δrelativistic

is the binding correction derived in [30]. The radiative correction has been derived assuming

the exponential model with the same parameter RE for both charge and magnetization

distributions, i.e.

4 log (meRE) +

The accuracy of this approximation is suﬃcient for our purpose. Calculating δradiative for

expressed in terms of electric and magnetic moments of the proton:

δps = 1.0154(3) × δZemach + 1.4 × 10−8 .

(5).

In addition, we need to correct the dominant term of the recoil contribution with the mag-

netic radius hr2i1/2

m = 0.779 fm. As a result, the recoil correction turns out to be 6.01(9)

Deducing again the proton-size correction by means of equation (5), we ﬁnd the Zemach

radius of the proton: Rp = 1.047(19) fm. This value diﬀers from the one obtained in [11],

Rp = 1.037(16) fm, mainly due to the recalculated recoil correction.

IV. DISCUSSION

The value for the Zemach radius obtained above enables us to determine an improved

magnetic radius of the proton: hr2i1/2

m = 0.759(39) fm. The corresponding uncertainty is

mainly due to errors associated with the polarizability eﬀect as well as the uncertainty of

the charge radius of the proton. In Table I we present the ﬁnal values and together with the

ascribed errors for the contributions to the hyperﬁne splitting in hydrogen. The value for

δps has been obtained by means of the experimental energy splitting, according to equation

Another way to determine the proton magnetic radius is based on experimental data from

elastic electron-proton scattering. Accordingly, Friar and Sick have recently determined the

Zemach radius of the proton to be Rp = 1.086(12) fm [13]. Based on this value for Rp

and employing an exponential parametrization for both electric and magnetic form factors,

we ﬁnd the value of the proton magnetic radius hr2i1/2

m = 0.824(27) fm. As one can see, a

disargreement between the values for the Zemach radius and, therefore, between those for the

magnetic radius, obtained from the hydrogen hyperﬁne splitting and from electron-proton

scattering experiments remains. At present we have no explanation for this disagreement.

One may hope that a new determination of the proton charge radius via the Lamb-shift

experiment with muonic hydrogen, which is now in progress at PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute)

[31], will elucidate the situation. Also, independent calculations of polarization eﬀects of the

proton and recoil corrections would be desirable.

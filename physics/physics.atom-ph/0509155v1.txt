It is shown that the scattering length can be obtained by solving a Riccati equation derived from
variable phase theory. Two methods of solving it are presented. The equation is used to predict
how long range interactions inﬂuence the scattering length, and upper and lower bounds on the
scattering length are determined. The predictions are compared with others and it is shown how
they may be obtained from secular perturbation theory.

INTRODUCTION

theory and also compare them with correction formulae
that have been obtained elsewhere [10, 11, 12].

It is well established that knowledge of the scatter-
ing length of a pair of colliding atoms is important in
the interpretation of observations of the behaviour of
cold trapped ensembles of such atoms [1, 2, 3]. Scatter-
ing lengths are usually calculated by solving the single-
channel radial Schr¨odinger equation to ﬁnd the phase
shifts for several small values of the wavenumber of rel-
ative motion and extrapolating from eﬀective range ex-
pansions [4], or by solving the zero-energy Schr¨odinger
equation and evaluating quadratures [5].

The Schr¨odinger equation is a second order diﬀeren-
tial equation. We shall show another method of eval-
uating the scattering length in which we solve the ﬁrst
order equation, a Riccati equation, of the variable phase
approach to potential scattering [6]. Solving the equa-
tion is not simple and we shall suggest and illustrate two
methods that circumvent the inherent diﬃculties. A dif-
ferential equation can be obtained for the eﬀective range
[6] but it is not amenable to numerical solution.

In obtaining the scattering length from the solution of
the Schr¨odinger or Riccati equation, we must obtain so-
lutions at inﬁnite values of the interatomic separation, R.
In practice we stop the solution at some value Rc, but
Rc must be chosen very large, and such choices increase
computation time and accumulated error. We shall show
how the Riccati equation can be used to predict correc-
tions, to be applied to the calculated scattering length,
that compensate for stopping the calculation at ﬁnite dis-
tance Rc; such corrections enable us to make calculations
with smaller values of Rc while maintaining desired ac-
curacy [7, 8, 9].

The solution of a low energy Schr¨odinger equation may
be corrected for the inﬂuence of a long range interac-
tion at separations exceeding Rc by perturbation theory.
However the perturbation expansion is made in terms of
the ratio of the potential energy to the kinetic energy
and becomes invalid as the energy of the collision is re-
duced (as is necessary in the usual methods to obtain a
scattering length). This problem may be avoided by use
of secular perturbation theory [9]. We shall discuss our
predicted corrections in the light of secular perturbation

II. VARIABLE PHASE THEORY

The s-wave Schr¨odinger equation for a pair of colliding

atom is:

d2
dR2 − V (R) + k2

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

y(k; R) = 0,

(1)

where V (R) = 2µV(R)/¯h2, V(R) being the interac-
tion potential, µ the reduced mass, ¯h the rationalised
Planck’s constant, k the asymptotic (for large separa-
tion, R) wavenumber of relative motion and R−1y(k; R)
the wavefunction. The phase shift δk is obtained from
the wavefunction at large R:

y(k; R) ∼ sin (kR + δk) .

(2)

Suppose that δk(Rc) is the phase shift appropriate to the
truncated potential V(R)H(Rc − R) where H denotes
Heaviside’s unit step function. The phase shift δk is the
limit of δk(Rc) as Rc → ∞. The phase shift δk(Rc) is
the phase shift that is determined numerically when the
potential is assumed to be negligible at R > Rc; it has
long been studied, is called the variable phase function
and satisﬁes a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation in Rc [6].
The potential for a pair of scattering alkali atoms is
dominated at long range by the van der Waals interaction
−C6R−6
and the well known problem of ﬁnding ultra-
c
low energy phase shifts from Eqs. (1) and (2) is that Rc
must be chosen very large to ensure that −C6R−6 has
negligible magnitude compared to ¯h2k2/2µ when k itself
is very small.

The scattering length a is the limit of −k−1 tan δk for
vanishing k [4]. The scattering length a(Rc) = ac is the
corresponding limit of −k−1 tan δk(Rc) and ac → a as
Rc → ∞. Calogero [6] derived the Riccati equation in
Rc satisﬁed by a(Rc) or ac. We simplify the notation by
dropping the subscript c and note that Calogero’s def-
inition of a(R) is opposite in sign to that used in the

2

eﬀective range expansion [4]. We see that the Riccati
equation is

A. Change of Variables

We make the change of variables[26]

da(R)
dR

= [R − a(R)]2 V (R).

(3)

Hence we can ﬁnd the scattering length by solving Eq. (3)
over the interval [0, Rc] with initial condition a(0) = 0
where Rc is chosen suﬃciently large.

and

a(R) = tan θ(R),

(4)

III. NUMERICAL METHODS

R = tan φ(R),

(5)

The numerical solution of Eq. (3) is non-trivial. The
function a(R) contains poles that correspond to the
bound states supported by the potential as we illustrate
in ﬁgure 1 for the test case described in section 3.3.
Finite diﬀerence methods such as the Runge-Kutta
method are unsuitable. Two possible ways to solve
Eq. (3) are to change its variables, and to solve a closely
related equation by the log-derivative method.

dθ(φ)
dφ

= sec4 φ sin2 [θ(φ) − φ)] V [tan(φ)],

(6)

which we solve over a range [0, φc] by the Runge-Kutta
method [13]. The value of φc corresponds to Rc and is
close to π/2.

which is the Riccati equation for the log-derivative of the
radial wavefunction at zero energy [14, 15]. The substi-
tution is also inferred by the asymptotic form, R − a, of
the radial wavefunction at large R. The log-derivative
method can be evaluated by the propagator [16, 17]

with the initial condition that u(0) is very large, where
h is the step length; the local truncation error is O(h6)
[17]. The success of the log-derivative method in treating
the poles of u(R) is attributable to its derivation from ﬁ-
nite diﬀerence approximations to the wavefunction and
its derivative [16, 17, 18]; it is an example of a symplec-
tic integrator in which the distance coordinate and its
canonical partner are advanced simultaneously [18].

C. Numerical examples

We tested the numerical methods of sections 3.1 and
3.2 by evaluating the scattering length for a pair of cae-
sium atoms, each of mass 2.422 × 105 atomic units (a.u)
interacting via the model potential described by Gribakin
and Flambaum [19]

C8 = 1.1 × 106, C10 = 1.7 × 108 and R′ = 23.165, all
in atomic units. As is the case in Numerov’s method
the local truncation error in the log-derivative method
is approximately proportional to h6|V (R)|3 [20]. To
economise on computation and reduce possible trunca-
tion error we doubled the step length whenever the local
truncation error had reduced by approximately a factor
of 2 [8, 21] when using the log-derivative method; the
propagator in Eq. (8) is easily modiﬁed to accomodate
the change in step length. When solving the ﬁrst order
equation, Eq. (6), we used the Runge-Kutta method [13]
with a self-adjusting step length. Both methods yielded
the same scattering length as expected which was accu-
rate to 7 signiﬁcant ﬁgures with Rc = 40000 bohr in
agreement with the ﬁndings of Marinescu [11]. The vari-
able phase function is illustrated by the curve for ac in
ﬁgure 2; the last pole is located at around 100 bohr and
for R >100 bohr the function is smooth and approaches
its limit ultimately from above.

IV. CORRECTIONS TO THE SCATTERING
LENGTH

Eq. (3) illustrates clearly the eﬀect of neglecting the
potential for R > Rc since the equation can be recast as

Rc

a =

Z
0

[R − a(R)]2 V (R)dR+

[R − a(R)]2 V (R)dR.

∞

Z

Rc

(11)
The ﬁrst part of this equation is the scattering length
ac = a(Rc) calculated by any numerical method in which
the computation is stopped at separation Rc. The second
part is the contribution made by the long range interac-
tion; the choice of Rc = 40000 bohr in the calculations
of section 3.3 was needed to ensure that the second part
was suﬃciently small to give seven ﬁgure accuracy in the
scattering length.

A. The First Order Correction

The correction is

Ec = E(Rc) =

[R − a(R)]2 V (R)dR.

We wish to extract the term that is of ﬁrst order in the
potential strength. We evaluate the quadrature, Eq. (12),

where

thus increasing the order each time. We ﬁnd

Ec = E(1)

(16)

and

Y (R) =

X(R)dR.

(17)

When examining the corrections at R = Rc we assume
that the potential is attractive for R > Rc. The cor-
rection Ec is clearly negative so that ac approaches a
from above as illustrated in ﬁgure 2. If the potential is
a negative series of inverse powers then Vc < 0, Wc > 0,
Xc < 0 and Yc > 0; if also either a(R) < 0 and R > Rc
or R > a(R) > Rc then the integrand in the last part of
Eq. (13) is negative and Ec < E(1)

. Hence

c

a = ac + Ec < ac + E(1)

,

c

(18)

and therefore the ﬁrst order corrected scattering length
approaches a from above. This is illustrated in ﬁgure
2 by the curve a(U). The ﬁrst order correction E(1)
is
seen from Eq. (14) to be negative. Hence the ﬁrst order
corrected scattering length, ac + E(1)
, is a better approx-
imation than is ac. Both ac and ac + E(1)
are upper
bounds.

tain a lower bound to the scattering length. We do this
by partially taking account of the higher order correc-
tions to obtain an expression that is correct to at least

ﬁrst order but also includes suﬃcient higher order terms
to be a lower bound. We integrate Eq. (20) by parts to
ﬁnd

Ec = E (2)

not a guaranteed lower bound but, on the assumption
that Rc is suﬃciently large that the higher order terms
are negligible it is, in practice, a lower bound. We have
achieved bounds on the scattering length; from Eq. (14)

Marinescu [11] derived a series of corrections to the
scattering length for diﬀering orders of the potential
strength. He derived corrections from an iterative so-
lution to a sequence of diﬀerential equations, one correc-

(25)

(26)

tion for each order of the potential strength. On substi-
tuting the functions deﬁned by Eqs. (15), (16) and (17)
into Marinescu’s ﬁrst order correction we ﬁnd that it is
the same as the correction given by Eq. (26). Marinescu
showed that his higher order corrections alternate in sign
giving upper and lower bounds. Our equations (25) and
(26) provide bounds very simply; while they are guaran-
teed correct only to the ﬁrst order they provide good, use-
ful corrections for calculations with a moderately small
value of Rc. In the model caesium collision problem dis-
cussed in section 3.3, range of 1250 bohr proved suﬃcient
to yield seven ﬁgure accuracy. This range agrees with
that found by Marinescu. The higher order corrections
are complicated. The curve a(L) in ﬁgure 2 illustrates
how the lower bound corrections leads to a scattering
length that approaches a from below.

C.

Inverse Power Series Potentials

For the calculations shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2, we used

the asymptotic potential

V(R) = −C6R

−6 − C8R

−8 − C10R

−10,

(27)

with the coeﬃcients shown in section 3.3. With such
inverse power potentials Eqs. (14), (24) and (26) assume
simple forms.

When the term is R−6 is considered alone we ﬁnd that
Eq. (14) yields the expression that Szmytkowski [12] de-
rived from analysis of the asymptotic wavefunctions. In
his analysis Szmytkowski gave also an expression for the
scattering length in the form of a fraction involving Bessel
functions. By replacing the Bessel functions by their
asymptotic expansions for small arguments we ﬁnd that
Szmytkowski’s ratio agrees with the lower bound a(L) in
Eq. (26).

When a term −CnR−n dominates the potential the

upper and lower bounds are

V. SECULAR PERTURBATION THEORY

Secular perturbation theory has been applied to mo-
tion in the long range polarisation potential −C4R−4 by
Cavagnero [9]. He showed how the scattering length is
altered by long range interactions in accord with the pre-
dictions of Spruch et al [22]. We indicate below how sec-
ular perturbation theory yields the lower bound a(L) for
the scattering length for a van der Waals −C6R−6 poten-
tial. The result is easily generalised for a potential such
as that in Eq. (27).

We are interested in the solution of Eq. (1), with
V (R) = −C6R−6, for small values of the wavenumber
k and large values of the separation R. Substituting
R−1y(k, R) =
(k/z)M (z), where z = kR, in Eq. (1)

low energy phase shifts for the model caesium scattering
problem were determined with a matching radius of only
50 bohr [25].

The secular perturbation expansion for the scatter-
ing length appropriate for the potential in Eq. (27) is
identical to that of Marinescu [11] to the ﬁrst two or-
ders in the secular expansion. When the leading term
dominates, the secular expansion yields the correction of
Szmytkowski [12].

VI. CONCLUSION

The variable phase method for potential scattering
yields a simple ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by
a function that tends in the limit of inﬁnite interatomic
separation to the scattering length [6]. The equation can
be solved by specially adapted numerical methods, thus
providing a method to compute the scattering length.
This, and all other computations, being ﬁnite necessar-
ily approximate the scattering length by its value com-
puted at some maximum separation Rc. The diﬀerential
equation is readily employed to derive corrections aris-
ing from long range interactions over the range [Rc, ∞].
We derived two such corrections accurate to at least ﬁrst
order which provide upper and lower computed bounds
to the scattering length.
In a model collision problem
these corrections provide a 40-fold reduction in the value
of Rc that is necessary to let us obtain an accurate scat-
tering length. The corrections are very simple and we
suggest that use of the ﬁrst order correction with a mod-
erate value of Rc is suﬃcient. Other methods involve
a more complete but more complicated correction, such
as the 50th order secular perturbation theory [9, 25] or
higher order expansions of the solution of the zero-energy
Schr¨odinger equation [11], applied to a calculation with
a much smaller value of Rc. However, with techniques
such as interval doubling [8, 21] there is little advantage
in having Rc very small. We note that the ﬁrst order
diﬀerential equation for the eﬀective range [6], while not
useful numerically, does yield the ﬁrst order long range
correction derived previously [8, 10].

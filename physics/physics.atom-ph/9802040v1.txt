Abstract

In the absence of losses the phase of a Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes collapses
and revivals in time due to elastic atomic interactions. As experiments necessarily involve
inelastic collisions, we develop a model to describe the phase dynamics of the condensates
in presence of collisional losses. We ﬁnd that a few inelastic processes are suﬃcient to
damp the revivals of the phase. For this reason the observability of phase revivals for
present experimental conditions is limited to condensates with a few hundreds of atoms.

Introduction

Since the recent experimental observations of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases
[1], [2], [3], much interest has been raised about the characteristic features of the condensate
[4], and about its coherence properties in particular. Considerable attention has been devoted
to the matter of the relative phase between two Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs): how the
phase manifests itself in an interference experiment (such as the one performed recently at
MIT [5]), how the phase can be established by measurement, and how it evolves in presence of
the elastic atomic interactions (see e.g. [6] and references therein). In this paper, in view of a
possible experimental investigation of these problems, we complete the theoretical work already
done on this subject by studying the dynamics of the relative phase in presence of loss processes
occurring in the two condensates. Such loss processes, unavoidable in a real experiment, are
due for example to collisions of condensed atoms with the background gas, or to three-body
collisions between condensed atoms followed by recombination of two atoms to form a molecule
[7, 8].

We consider two mutually non interacting and spatially non overlapping BECs in two trap-
ping potentials. We suppose that the experimentalist has at hand a device, such as the one
depicted in ﬁg.1, allowing both the measurement of the relative phase between the condensates
and the preparation of a state with a well deﬁned relative phase [9]. Starting from an initial
state with a well deﬁned relative phase, we imagine that the two condensates evolve indepen-
dently, under the inﬂuence of the atomic interactions, during a given time interval t at the end
of which a measurement of the relative phase is performed. By repeating this procedure many
times, one accesses the probability distribution of the relative phase [9].

In the lossless case, the relative phase shows collapses and revivals periodically in time due
to the presence of elastic atomic interactions. In presence of losses, we ﬁnd that a few inelastic
processes are suﬃcient to dramatically damp the revivals of the phase. In practice, for typical
experimental conﬁgurations, the observability of the revivals is limited to condensates with a
small number of atoms, of the order of a few hundreds, for which the revival time is of the order
of 0.1 to 1 second.

In section 2 we present the theoretical model describing the evolution of the system in
presence of losses. An interesting feature of the model is that it can be solved almost exactly
analytically within the Monte Carlo wave function approach recently put forward by several
authors [10, 11, 12, 13]. We take advantage of this circumstance in the following sections, to
deduce analytical expressions for the interesting phase-dependent measurable quantities, and
to a give a simple picture of the phase dynamics in presence of losses:

In section 3 we ﬁnd an approximate analytical expression for the evolution of a single
stochastic wave function, and we give a simple physical interpretation of the result pointing out
separately the role of the elastic atomic interactions and of the losses in the dynamics of the
relative phase of the condensates. In sections 4 and 5 we concentrate on the case in which the
two condensates are placed in two identical traps and have initially the same average number
of atoms, and we use the analytical results of section 3 to calculate the time dependence of
some relative phase dependent quantities. In particular in section 4 we consider an interference
experiment where one counts the atoms detected in the two output channels of the beam-splitter
of ﬁg.1, and we analyze the two diﬀerent physical situations in which the condensates’ relative
phase is initially sharply deﬁned or is described by a “broad” relative phase distribution with a
width
. In section 5 we imagine instead an experiment in which the time evolution of the
whole relative phase probability distribution is measured. Sections 6 and 7 are dedicated to the
analysis of additional features that would appear in an experiment; the eﬀect of asymmetries in
the parameters of the two condensates and in the initial average number of atoms is considered
in section 6, and the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations in the initial total number of atoms is considered in
section 7. Some concluding remarks are presented in section 8.

2.1 The master equation

Let us consider two mutually non-interacting and spatially non-overlapping BECs A and B in
two harmonic potentials. Our starting point to describe the evolution of this system in presence
of m-body losses is a master equation for the density matrix ρ describing the atoms in the traps:

=

g

where H0 is the one-particle Hamiltonian including the trapping potential and the kinetic
energy, and g = 4π¯h2a/M where M is the mass of the atoms and a is the s-wave scattering
length.

The loss terms in Eq.(1) are parameterized by the number m of particles lost per collisional
event and by the collisional constant κ. Physically the case m = 1 corresponds to collisions of
atoms in the condensate with atoms of background gas in the cell; the case m = 2 corresponds to
spin-ﬂip collisions between condensed atoms in magnetic traps, as only speciﬁc spin components
are trapped; the case m = 3 corresponds to three-body collisions between condensed atoms,
leading to the formation of an excited molecule and a hot atom supposed to leave the condensate.
The collisional constant κ for the processes m = 1 and m = 3 has been measured for 87Rb atoms
at JILA [7] and for 23Na atoms at MIT [8]. The collisional constant for the m = 2 process
has not been accurately measured for these atoms yet, as the two-body losses seem to give a
smaller contribution to the total decay rate.

We assume that at any time the state of the condensate A (resp. B) can be described in
terms of a single occupied mode, neglecting the excitations out of this mode due to a non-zero
temperature or to the loss processes. We assume furthermore that these modes are the single
particle ground state wave functions φa, φb given self-consistently as functions of the number of
particles by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation:

H0 + gNǫ|

φǫ(~r; Nǫ)

φǫ(~r; Nǫ) = µǫ(Nǫ)φǫ(~r; Nǫ) ,

where the µǫ(Nǫ)’s are the chemical potentials for the condensates with Nǫ particles, and where
the wave functions φǫ are normalized to unity. In more mathematical words we approximate
the atomic ﬁeld operator by:

ˆψ(~r) =

cǫφǫ(~r; ˆNǫ)

where the operators c†a (c†b) and ca (cb) create and annihilate a particle in the condensate A
(B) respectively, and where ˆNǫ = c†ǫcǫ are the operators giving the number of particles in each

in the condensate.

By substituting Eq.(4) into Eq.(2) we get

H = Ea( ˆNa) + Eb( ˆNb)

By assuming that in the considered time interval the atom number distributions in the two

¯Nǫ = Tr[ρ(0)c†ǫcǫ] ,

we expand the condensates’ Hamiltonian around ¯Na, ¯Nb keeping up to the quadratic terms:

(8)

In our model we will use this quadratic version of the Hamiltonian, where the chemical potentials
µa and µb and their derivatives can be calculated by solving numerically the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation (3).

We now substitute our ansatz Eq.(4) in the loss part of the master equation; since the

condensates do not overlap this amounts to the substitution

[ ˆψ(~r)]m

[ˆcǫφǫ(~r; ˆNǫ)]m

In contrast to the Hamiltonian part which required a careful quadratization in
in Eq.(1).
ˆNǫ −
¯Nǫ to get the correct phase dynamics, the dissipative part will be treated to lowest order
by replacing ˆNǫ by ¯Nǫ in Eq.(9). This allows us ﬁnally to obtain a master equation of the form:

2.2 Stochastic formulation

To study the evolution of the system we adopt the Monte Carlo wave function point of view
[10] which provides us with a stochastic formulation of the master equation (10). To this aim
we introduce the jump operators:

and an eﬀective Hamiltonian:

Usually the Monte Carlo wave function technique is carried out purely numerically. It turns
out that for the present problem it is possible to treat analytically the evolution of a Monte
Carlo wave function and, after a minor approximation, average analytically over all the possible
stochastic realizations. This leads to a simple interpretation of the dynamics and allows the
derivation of analytical formulas for observables’ mean values. As it will appear in the ﬁgures
the analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical results.

3 Evolution of a single wave function

In this section we derive an approximate formula for the evolution of a single stochastic wave
function, and we discuss its physical interpretation. We ﬁrst consider the simple case in which

5

the condensates are initially in a phase state, introduced in the beginning of the section, and
subsequently the general case in which the initial state is characterized by a given relative phase
distribution.

For the following it will be useful to introduce the operators
ˆn = ˆNb −

ˆN = ˆNb + ˆNa

ˆNa

corresponding to the sum and diﬀerence of the number of atoms in A and in B.

3.1 Phase states

where the δǫ,ǫ′ for ǫ, ǫ′ = a, b are Kronecker deltas. The ﬁrst property reﬂects the fact that in a
phase state, all the particles are in the same state (see Eq.(17)), and the second one shows that
n and φ are to some extent conjugate variables like the momentum and position of a particle.
Note that the phase states are not orthogonal:

In this approximation the statistics of the quantum jumps is simply Poissonian with a parameter
λ and δb,ǫj = 1
δa,ǫj takes the values 1 and 0 with probabilities λb/λ and λa/λ respectively,
according to Eq.(14).

We then expand the eﬀective Hamiltonians in each exponential in Eq.(26) around ˆNa, ˆNb
in powers of mδǫ,ǫk, m(δǫ,ǫk + δǫ,ǫk−1), etc. Due to the quadratic dependence of Eq.(27) on ˆNa
and ˆNb we limit the expansion at the ﬁrst order, the subsequent terms being constants or zero.

We sketch out brieﬂy the physical interpretation of the result Eq.(29), considering the action

of the successive factors in Eq.(29) on a phase state deﬁned in Eq.(17).

•

The factor U0(t) in Eq.(29) accounts for the evolution in absence of losses. Expressed in
terms of the operators ˆN and ˆn of Eq.(16) it involves:

H q(

Nǫ}

{

) = f0( ˆN ) + ˆnv( ˆN) + ˆn2(µ′b + µ′a)/8 .

where ¯N = ¯Na + ¯Nb and where µǫ stands for µǫ( ¯Nǫ). From the properties of the phase
state we ﬁnd that the terms in ˆn and ˆn2 in Eq.(33), when exponentiated in U0, (i) shift
the relative phase at the N-dependent constant speed v( ˆN) and (ii) spread the relative
phase (in a way analogous to the spreading of a wave packet of a massive particle under
free evolution), respectively. The term f0( ˆN ) in Eq.(33) is a function of the total number
of atoms N only and plays no role, since it amounts in U0(t) to adding a global phase
factor to the wave function. The phase-spreading will eventually lead to a collapse of
the relative phase [4]. On the other hand due to the discreteness of the spectrum of
the operator ˆn (the spectrum of ˆn consists of even integers for an even N, and of odd
integers for an odd N), there are special times at which the exponential operator Eq.(33)
reduces to a mere translation of the relative phase, yielding the well known result that
revivals should follow the collapses of the relative phase. More precisely if one uses the
expansion Eq.(15) for the phase state deﬁned in Eq.(17), one realizes that a relative phase
distribution initially peaked around φ0 displays revivals at the times:

tR = qπ/χ ,

have a dramatic inﬂuence on the coherence properties of the condensates.

To monitor the evolution of the relative phase between the condensates, a possible choice is to
after some time during which the two
determine the relative phase dependent quantity
condensates, initially prepared in a state with a deﬁned relative phase, evolve independently.
As the relative phase between the condensates is aﬀected by the elastic atomic interactions, the
average

undergoes collapses and revivals in time.

In the situation described in ﬁg.1 the measure of

would correspond to the following
measurement scheme: Prepare a state in which A and B have a well deﬁned relative phase
[9]; let the condensates evolve during a time interval t; then let p
N atoms escape from
the condensates and beat them on the beam-splitter. The counts registered in the two output
channels of the beam-splitter will be ﬂuctuating variables whose averages over many realizations
of the whole procedure are [9]:

In the present and in the following section we restrict for simplicity to the perfectly symmet-
ric case where the two trapping potentials are identical and the two condensates have initially
the same mean number of particles:

This formula does not depend on the initial width ∆φ and coincides with the one Eq.(55)
obtained for a phase state. There is therefore no possible way of reducing the damping of the
revivals by adjusting the initial width of the phase distribution. Only the temporal width of
the revivals is larger for a distribution broader than that for a phase state, as it clearly appears
from a comparison between ﬁg.3 and the previous ﬁg.2b.

In the frame of our model, the evolution of c(φ) can be obtained numerically from the

to ﬁnd some simple results at the revival times.

Let the initial state of the condensate, with a total number N of atoms, be characterized
by a given relative phase distribution c(φ, 0); the state vector at time t is then given by our
approximated formula Eq.(43). One can easily check that the integrand in Eq.(43) is periodic
of period π so that we can shift the interval of integration to obtain: 3

mk. This result has a very suggestive interpretation:

where ˜c(φ) = e−
The loss processes in a single realization shift the relative phase distribution by a random
amount D, and the overall evolution can be separated in a random shift plus the Hamiltonian
evolution. To make clearer this interpretation, we have plotted in ﬁg.5 the phase distribution at
the second revival time (given by Eq.(35) with q = 2) for diﬀerent realizations. For λtR ≃
1, as
in the ﬁgure, there is an important fraction of realizations in which the relative phase is shifted
considerably. This is the reason why the relative phase distribution at the revival time will be
smeared out by the losses when we take the average over the stochastic realization, which we
do now.

As in section 4 we consider the symmetric case deﬁned by the Eqs.(45), (46), (47). Fur-
thermore we restrict ourselves to the revival times t = tR = qπ/χ, q integer (see Eq.(35)).
In this case the Hamiltonian evolution operator in Eq.(65) takes a simple numerical form (see
Eq.(37) and Eq.(38)) and by comparing Eq.(65) to Eq.(21) we can simply read out the phase
distribution amplitude c(φ, t):

6 Eﬀect of an asymmetry between the two condensates

In the previous sections we have investigated the relative phase dynamics in the symmetric case
for the two condensates. In this section we extend the analysis to account for a small imbalance
in the initial average number of particles

¯Na| ≪
where ¯N is the average of the total initial number of particles, and for arbitrary values of the
parameters µa, µb, γa, γb. We restrict the calculation to the contrast of the interference fringes
between the two condensates averaged over many experimental realizations, assuming an initial
phase distribution broader than the phase state.

elastic interactions in the condensate B (µ′b = 0) (or vice versa).

Through all the previous sections in this paper we have chosen an initial state, represented by
our initial Monte Carlo wave function, with a ﬁxed total number of particles in the condensates.

The averages that we calculated
supposing that the initial total number of atoms is ﬁxed to a value N for any realization of the
experiment. In practice it is probably diﬃcult to produce a Fock state for the condensates and
the total number of atoms should be governed by some probability distribution P (N). Since
ﬁx), it is
we have analytical formulas for the quantities of interest (such as the average
very simple to add a further averaging over N for a given P (N). Suppose for example that
the distribution for the initial total number of atoms is a Poissonian distribution of parameter
¯N . By averaging the result Eq.(71), valid at the revival times tR for slightly asymmetric
condensates, we get:

If the symmetry between the condensates is perfectly realized, the atom number ﬂuctuations
have the simple eﬀect of doubling the revival time. We show an example in ﬁg.8 where we
ﬁx for an initial phase state (ﬁg.2) using a Poissonian distribution
averaged the result for
for P (N). The main eﬀect is the disappearance of the “odd” revivals; this is due to the fact that
the amplitude of these odd revivals for N particles is proportional to [cos(qπ)](N

which alternates its sign depending on the parity of N.

In fact it is possible to show that a Poissonian ensemble of phase states is equivalent to a
coherent state for the two condensates, as long as one calculates the mean values of operators
commuting with the total number of particles in the condensates. For the perfectly symmetric
case in ﬁg.8 we then recover the result obtained in [15] (in the absence of losses) i.e. the doubling
of the revival period for a coherent state of the condensates as compared to the phase state.

Within the coherent states pictures we can also reinterpret the result Eq.(74) for the asym-
metric case in the following way:
in order to observe a revival of the relative phase between
two condensates it is necessary that both condensates display a phase revival at the same time
i.e. µ′a/2¯htR = qπ and µ′b/2¯htR = q′π, with q, q′ integers.

8 Concluding remarks

We have studied the dynamics of the relative phase between two Bose-Einstein condensates in
presence of m-body loss processes in order to question the observability of the collapses and
revivals of the phase predicted by purely Hamiltonian models.

We have shown that the losses damp exponentially in time the phase dependent quantity

coincides (up to the factor m) with the mean total number of
tion). The decay rate λ of
particles lost per unit of time, and it is therefore approximately N times larger than the inverse
lifetime of a particle in the condensates, where N is the total number of particles initially in
the condensates.

The dramatic eﬀect of the losses on the relative phase has been suggestively interpreted
within the Monte Carlo wave function approach. In a single realization each single loss event
occurring at a time of the order of the revival time shifts the relative phase by a random
amount of the order of π. A few loss processes are then suﬃcient to smear out the relative
phase completely at the revival time when the average over the stochastic realizations is taken.
For this reason the experimental observation of the revivals is limited to condensates with a
small number of atoms where the condition λtR < 1 (where tR is the revival time Eq.(35)) can
be satisﬁed for all the relevant loss processes in the system.

In order to give an idea of the possible scenarios and of the order of magnitudes in diﬀerent
experimental conditions, we have shown in ﬁg.9 the loss rates due to one-body and three-
body collisions and the inverse revival time as functions of the total number of atoms, for
two diﬀerent values of the trap frequencies. For higher trap frequencies (ﬁg.9a) the revivals

17

occur on a shorter time scale and one is confronted mainly to three-body losses, while for
less conﬁning traps (ﬁg.9b) collisions with the residual gas should be taken into account due
to longer revival times. Fig.9 shows that phase revivals in presence of losses are in principle
observable in condensates with some hundreds of atoms.

By studying the general case of two asymmetric condensates, and the eﬀects of ﬂuctuations
in the initial total number of atoms in the condensates, we have ﬁnally pointed out a practical
diﬃculty which should be overcome in order to observe phase revivals. The diﬃculty comes
from the fact that in the case of two non perfectly symmetric condensates their relative phase
drifts with a velocity depending on the initial total number of atoms. For this reason random
ﬂuctuations in the initial number of atoms turn out to destroy the relative phase revivals when
the asymmetry is too large. A possible way to overcome this problem is of course to use two
almost symmetric condensates. Another possibility, which we have not examined in detail,
would be to use a condensate A which has a collapse time longer than the duration of the
experiment ( ¯N(µ′atR/¯h)2
1) as a phase reference to measure the evolving phase of the other
condensate B.

Appendix C: asymmetric condensates

In this appendix we show the explicit calculation of the mean contrast of the interference
ﬁx for asymmetric condensates. We consider an initial Monte Carlo wave function

has a Gaussian probability distribution:

of ﬂuctuations of the initial total number of atoms.

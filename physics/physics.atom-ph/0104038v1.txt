We demonstrate the possibility of energy-selective removal
of cold atoms from a tight optical trap by means of parametric
excitation of the trap vibrational modes. Taking advantage
of the anharmonicity of the trap potential, we selectively re-
move the most energetic trapped atoms or excite those at the
bottom of the trap by tuning the parametric modulation fre-
quency. This process, which had been previously identiﬁed as
a possible source of heating, also appears to be a robust way
for forcing evaporative cooling in anharmonic traps.

Parametric excitation of atomic motion due to laser
intensity ﬂuctuations has been recently indicated as one
of the major sources of heating in far-oﬀ resonance opti-
cal traps (FORTs) [1,2], and as a limitation in achieving
In this Letter we show
very long trapping times [3,4].
that parametric excitation in a FORT can also lead to a
cooling of the trapped sample, since the anharmonicity
of the potential allows a selective removal of the most
energetic atoms alone.

The excitation process has typically been modeled as-
suming a harmonic FORT potential [1,2]. For a mod-
ulation of the potential depth at twice the trap vibra-
tional frequencies, an exponential heating of the trapped
sample, accompanied by trap losses, has been predicted.
The main features of the parametric heating process pre-
dicted by the harmonic theory have been experimentally
observed [5–7]. Going beyond the basic trap model, it
has been possible to further reﬁne theoretical calculations
through modeling of the anharmonic trapping potential
used in actual experiments [8]. One of the consequences
of the anharmonicity is a variation of the trap frequencies
with vibrational energy, which implies that a modulation
at a single frequency will be resonant with a few trap lev-
els only.

We present here a detailed study of the temperature
of a sample of cold atoms in a one-dimensional (1D) lat-
tice FORT, in which the anharmonicity of the potential
is exploited to perform energy-selective excitation and
removal of the atoms, resulting in either heating or cool-
ing of the remaining trapped sample. In particular, the

cooling process appears to be a robust and relatively ef-
ﬁcient way to lower the atomic temperature via forced
evaporation.

The trap is created with a beam of single-mode radi-
ation generated by a Ti:sapphire laser at λT =787 nm,
red-detuned by approximately 18 nm from the D-lines
of potassium. The laser beam, after passing through an
acousto-optic modulator (AOM), is focused to w=90 µm
within a two-lens telescope, and then retroreﬂected to
form a vertical standing-wave. The focusing is chosen to
yield a large Rayleigh length, zR=3 cm, which results in
an almost uniform lattice depth along the vertical direc-
tion. Therefore, the optical potential close to the beam
waist has the form

where k = 2π/λT . About 107 atoms are prepared in a
magneto-optical trap (MOT) at a temperature of 60 µK,
and typically 5% of them are transferred to the FORT
thanks to a compression procedure described in [9]. After
loading the atoms in the FORT, the MOT beams are ex-
tinguished by means of AOMs and mechanical shutters,
and the atoms are left to evolve in the presence of the trap
light only. The density and the radial temperature of the
trapped atoms are determined using absorption imaging
of the atomic cloud after 1 ms of expansion following
release from the FORT. The typical vertical size of the
cloud of 700 µm indicates that approximately 1800 lattice
sites are occupied by an average of 300 atoms each. The
axial temperature of the atoms is measured with a time-
of-ﬂight (TOF) technique, by absorption of a sheet of
light passing about 1.5 cm below the FORT. The temper-
ature of the trapped atoms, after a 100-ms equilibration
phase following loading, stays constant during storage in
the FORT [9], and the radial and axial temperatures are
found to be equal within the uncertainty. The lifetime of
the FORT is limited to about 1.2 s mainly by collisions
with background gas.

The harmonic approximations for the radial and axial
frequencies of the single lattice site are measured with
a parametric excitation technique, as described below.
Typical values for these quantities are ωr=2π×1.3 kHz,
ωa=2π×700 kHz, which for the typical temperature
T =80 µK lead to a density of 1012 cm−3. From the mea-
sured value of ωa it is possible to estimate the trap depth
a/8π2, which corresponds to U0=700 µK.

We apply the parametric excitation via the control
AOM as a small sinusoidal modulation on the power
of the trapping laser, typically 200 ms after loading the

FORT. To measure the spectrum of excitation we have
repeated at diﬀerent modulation frequencies a procedure
composed of an excitation for a period Tex at ﬁxed mod-
ulation amplitude ǫ and frequency Ω, followed by detec-
tion of the number of atoms and radial temperature. For
both radial and axial excitation, as shown in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2 respectively, we see large resonances in the loss of
atoms, accompanied by dispersive resonances in the tem-
perature of the atoms left in the trap. The resonances in
the trap losses have been observed previously in optical
lattices [5,8,9], and their presence is expected even if we
approximate the FORT as a harmonic potential: when
Ω is close to 2 ωa or 2 ωr (or to their subharmonics) the
atoms are excited upwards along the ladder of energy
levels [1], and eventually lost from the trap. Note that
for the radial excitation two resonances at about ωr and
2 ωr are present, as expected for a harmonic trap, while
in the axial case there is an additional resonance close to
3.6 ωa, which is a clear signature of the anharmonicity of
the trap [8].

On the other hand, the observed shape of the res-
onances in the temperature of the remaining trapped
atoms are not expected for a harmonic trap [1,2]. Their
origin must be related to the anharmonicity of the poten-
tial, which implies that the vibrational frequency changes
with atomic energy. In Fig. 3 we show the excitation fre-
quency 2 ωa calculated for a perfectly 1D sinusoidal lat-
tice: while the atoms at the bottom of the trap are ex-
pected to oscillate at the harmonic vibrational frequency,
the most energetic ones have a much lower frequency,
because of the decreased curvature of the potential. A
similar behavior is also expected for the radial oscillation
frequency because of the gaussian shape of the radial
potential. Therefore, when the modulation frequency is
tuned to the red of 2 ωr, 2 ωa or their harmonics and sub-
harmonics, it is mainly the most energetic atoms that are
parametrically excited and ejected from the trap, result-
ing in a reduction of the mean energy of the remaining
atoms. On the contrary, resonant modulation frequencies
excite primarily atoms at the bottom of the trap, result-
ing in a net increase of the mean energy. We therefore
identify the quantities 2 ωr, 2 ωa with the position of the
main resonances in the temperature spectra of Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2 leading to a heating of the trapped sample.

These observations are an evidence of theoretical pre-
dictions that the peak in the resonance of atomic losses
in the trap occurs at a slightly lower frequency than the
actual harmonic frequencies [8]. This kind of informa-
tion is very useful, since the frequencies measured from
the trap loss resonances are used to estimate quantities
such as the number density or the phase-space density of
atoms in an optical lattice [5,9].

Note that the temperature measurements in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2 have been performed on the radial degree of free-
dom only, since the TOF detection of the axial tempera-
ture is strongly perturbed by the atoms excited out of the
trap as long as 100 ms before release. In all the measure-
ment we report here we have extracted the radial temper-

ature from the width of the atomic distribution, which
was always well ﬁtted by a gaussian, assuming thermal
equilibrium.

In the following we restrict our attention to the exci-
tation of the axial vibrational mode, which is the most
energetic and therefore requires a smaller perturbation
of the trapping potential [10], making modeling easier.
We also suspect that the large broadening of the radial
resonances in Fig. 1 might come from an ellipticity of the
laser beam that makes ωr vary in the radial plane, mask-
ing interesting characteristics of the resonances’ shape.

To analyze in more detail the axial resonances we need
to reﬁne the simple 1D model for the dispersion of the
axial vibrational frequencies presented in Fig. 3.
In-
deed, when considering the actual potential of Eq. 0.1
one would expect that the axial and radial degrees of
freedom are mixed by the anharmonicity. The main con-
sequence of the mixing is that ωa depends also on the
total energy, and not only on the axial energy. Since the
axial and radial oscillation periods diﬀer by a factor of
about 500, it is possible to deﬁne a local axial frequency
which varies during the radial motion of the atoms [11]

ωa(r) = 2πq2U0 exp(−2r2/w2)/M λ2
T .

(0.2)

As a result, the discrete excitation frequencies shown in
Fig. 3 for the 1D case become bands in 3D. The width of
these levels is expected to be negligible for atoms at the
bottom of the trap, which experience an harmonic poten-
tial, and to increase for increasing total energy, because
of the longer time spent by the atoms in the anharmonic
part of the potential. Thus, while the energetic atoms
can be excited by a large range of modulation frequen-
cies on the red of each parametric resonance, the ones at
the bottom of the potential can be excited only by a nar-
row range of frequencies close to ωa and its harmonics,
as conﬁrmed by the temperature spectrum in Fig. 2.

The role of anharmonicity in the excitation of atoms
having diﬀerent energies is conﬁrmed by a measure of
the equilibration time for the radial degree of freedom,
following a short axial excitation period, as reported in
Fig. 4. When Ω is tuned to the red of 2 ωa, the equi-
libration time is of the order of 5 ms, almost an order
of magnitude shorter than the elastic collisional time ex-
pected for our sample [9]. This observation indicates that
anharmonic cross-dimensional mixing can actually be the
dominant process in this case, as expected for a perturba-
tion of the high-lying trap states. If Ω is tuned to 2 ωa the
two degrees of freedom thermalize on a longer timescale
of 20-50 ms, which is more likely to be determined by
the rate of interatomic collisions alone. In fact the ther-
malization time shows an almost linear dependence on
the atomic density, as already observed in Refs. [12,9].
In accordance with our heuristic arguments, it appears
that anharmonic mixing is not important for excitation
of atoms at the bottom of the trap.

We have investigated the time evolution of

from 2 ωa, to get an indication of the eﬃciency of the se-
lective parametric excitation in cooling the atoms in the
FORT. The evolution reported in Fig. 5 was obtained
with ǫ=12%, Ω = 1.6 ωa, and Tex variable between 5 and
300 ms; the atom number and temperature were detected
after a 20-ms thermalization period. The general fea-
tures of the process discussed above are thus conﬁrmed:
at the beginning of the excitation phase the energetic
atoms are very eﬃciently removed from the trap, and
very likely the selection is performed on the total (3D)
energy (the reduction of the radial temperature following
axial excitation is very fast). We think that elastic colli-
sions are responsible for a continuous replenishing of the
high-lying states of the trap, giving rise to the observed
exponential decrease of both atom number and temper-
ature on a timescale much longer than 5 ms. Thus we
can consider this process to be one of evaporative cool-
ing, forced by the parametric excitation. As shown in
Fig. 5, after 150 ms the atom number and temperature
reach a steady state value, which is conserved even after
a further 150 ms period of excitation. The features just
described are very interesting from the perspective of us-
ing this technique to cool the atoms in the trap, since
an excitation at the proper frequency provides a fast re-
moval of the energetic atoms without heating the coldest
ones. After switching-oﬀ the parametric modulation at
t=300 ms we have measured a temperature increase at
a rate of 34(12) µKs−1 (compatible with that expected
for photon scattering), which indicates that the minimum
temperature reached in the cooling phase is probably not
limited by the excitation process itself.

From the two sets of data in Fig. 5 we extract the evo-
lution of the relative phase space density ρ reported the
inset, assuming thermal equilibrium between radial and
axial motions. Our experimental value for the parameter
which describes the overall eﬃciency of an evaporative
cooling process [13] is

It can be compared to the eﬃciency of a variety of evap-
orative techniques in optical and magnetic traps, as re-
ported in Ref. [13]. To our knowledge the process we have
investigated here represents the only way of forcing evap-
orative cooling in a standard optical trap [14] without a
reduction in the trap depth, a technique investigated in
Ref. [15].

Our FORT is actually not optimized for evaporation;
indeed we are obliged by the short lifetime of the trap
to force the removal of atoms on a timescale not much
larger than the elastic collisional time. Further investi-
gations in a better vacuum environment, or at a larger
atomic density, can provide better tests of the eﬃciency
of this cooling technique. Indeed, with a longer time for
evaporation one could try to use a modulation frequency
on the red of all the axial resonances (Ω < ωa), to excite
only the very energetic atoms and thus increase the cool-
ing eﬃciency. Also, one could try to investigate the eﬀect

of a sweep of Ω towards resonance during cooling, in an
analogous way to what is usually performed in magnetic
traps.

In conclusion, we have reported the observation of an
energy-selective removal of atoms from a FORT, as a
consequence of parametric excitation of anharmonic vi-

energy selectivity can be exploited to cool the trapped
sample. Since this eﬀect arises due to the anharmonicity
of the trapping potential, it should be observable in most
actual traps for cold particles. The removal mechanism
should work independently of the internal structure of
the trapped particles (atoms, molecules or ions), as it is
based on the excitation of their external degrees of free-
dom. The observations reported here should provide the
impetus for further investigations and theoretical model-
ing necessary for characterizing the ultimate limits and
eﬃciency of this cooling technique; however, it already
appears interesting for a fast cooling of an atomic sam-
ple in a tight FORT.

We report the implementation of a two-dimensional Raman cooling scheme using sequential exci-
tations along the orthogonal axes. Using square pulses, we have cooled a cloud of ultracold Cesium
atoms down to an RMS velocity spread of 0.39(5) recoil velocity, corresponding to an eﬀective tem-
perature of 30 nK (0.15 Trec). This technique can be useful to improve cold atom atomic clocks,
and is particularly relevant for clocks in microgravity.

INTRODUCTION

Types of laser cooling that involve atoms continually
absorbing and emitting photons cannot in general lead to
atomic velocity distributions narrower than the recoil ve-
locity vrec = ¯hk/M where k = 2π/λ is the wavevector of
photons with wavelength λ and M is the atomic mass. By
contrast, Raman cooling [1] and velocity selective coher-
ent population trapping [2, 3] can reach below this recoil
limit. These two techniques involve an eﬀective cessation
of the absorption of the light by the atoms once they have
reached a suﬃciently low velocity. We note that the only
application of subrecoil cooling of which we are aware [4]
used one-dimensional (1D) Raman cooling.

Raman cooling has been demonstrated in one, two and
three dimensions, but deeply subrecoil velocities were
only obtained in one dimension [1, 5]. In two and three
dimensions, the lowest velocity spreads (1D RMS veloci-
ties) obtained were respectively 0.85 vrec and 1.34 vrec [6].
Deﬁning the recoil temperature as kBTrec = M v2
rec, where
kB is the Boltzmann constant, these correspond to 0.72
and 1.80 Trec respectively. In this paper, we report the
implementation of an eﬃcient 2D Raman cooling scheme
that has produced velocity spreads as low as 0.39(5) vrec,
corresponding to 0.15 Trec, and that should, under ap-
propriate circumstances, reach even lower velocities. Our
technique diﬀers from that used previously in the shape
of the Raman pulses and the use of sequential excitations
along the orthogonal axes.

The use in atomic fountains of ultracold atoms, pro-
duced by laser cooling in optical molasses, has greatly im-
proved the accuracy of neutral-atom atomic clocks. Such
clocks work by launching the atoms vertically through a
microwave cavity, to which the atoms fall back after a
Ramsey time as long as about 1 s. The opening in the
microwave cavity has a diameter typically less than 1 cm,
so the transverse temperature must be low enough to al-

omy, and Geosciences, Towson MD 21252, USA

low a signiﬁcant number of the launched atoms to pass
through the cavity the second time. Atoms that do not
make it through the second time contribute to the colli-
sional shift without contributing to the signal. Fountain
clocks experiments with the coldest atoms achieve RMS
spreads as low as 2 vrec [7]. Under these circumstances,
many of the atoms are clipped by the second passage
through the cavity after 1 s of Ramsey time. For signiﬁ-
cantly longer Ramsey times, for example as envisioned for
space-borne clocks, even lower temperatures, as obtained
by subrecoil cooling, will be needed. Note that subrecoil
longitudinal cooling is not necessarily desirable, because
the longitudinal thermal expansion of the cloud reduces
the atomic density and thus reduces the collisional shift.
For that reason, the present work concentrates on two-
dimensional Raman cooling of an atomic sample released
from optical molasses, with a view to providing a valuable
tool for future atomic clocks.

The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we
summarize Raman cooling theory.
In section III, we
present the experimental details, with a stress on the ﬁne
tuning of the excitation spectrum of the Raman pulses.
Section IV gives the results obtained with our appara-
tus, in terms of ﬁnal velocity distribution and cooling
dynamics. In the conclusion, we summarized and discuss
our results and their applications.

II. RAMAN COOLING THEORY

The theory of one-dimensional Raman cooling in free
space, described in detail in [1, 8], is based on a two-step
cycle. We consider a cold cloud of cesium atoms ini-
tially in the hyperﬁne ground state 6S1/2, F = 3 (at this
stage, we ignore the Zeeman, mF , degeneracy). First,
the atoms are placed in the light ﬁeld of two oﬀ-resonant
beams counter-propagating along the x-axis, with fre-
quencies ω1 and ω2, and wavevectors k1 and k2 such
k, where k is a resonant wavevector

manifold is chosen to be much larger than the hyperﬁne
splitting of the upper state and also large enough to avoid
one-photon excitation. Second, a resonant pulse repumps
the atoms to F = 3 while giving them the possibility to
reach an x-velocity close to zero via the emission of a

In these equations, Ω1 and Ω2 are the eﬀective electric
dipole couplings of the Raman beams and ωHF is the hy-
perﬁne splitting. The three terms δLS, δD and 4δrec are
respectively the light shifts, the Raman Doppler eﬀect
and four times the recoil energy. This 3-level approach is
a good approximation of our problem under the following
conditions: the polarizations of the Raman beams are lin-
ear and the detuning ∆ is large compared to the upper
hyperﬁne splitting (see the discussion in section III C).
Choosing δ < 0 selects an initial velocity v whose x-
component is opposed to the velocity change, which is
what we want. Cooling the opposite side of the velocity

distribution implies repeating the cycle with the direc-
tions of k1 and k2 reversed from that shown in Fig.1.

Because of common mode rejection, only relative fre-
quency noise between the Raman laser beams aﬀects the
Raman selectivity. By phase locking them relative to
each other, this diﬀerence-frequency noise can be made
much smaller than the noise of their separate frequencies,
and negligible. The excitation spectrum is then fully de-
termined by the shape and amplitude of the pulses. A
careful tailoring of the pulse shape allows a precise exci-
tation spectrum that does not excite atoms with a zero
velocity along the x-axis (see for example Fig.4a). By
repeating the cooling cycle a large number of times, one
forces the atoms to perform a random walk in velocity
space until they hit the zero velocity state, a so-called
dark state, where they tend to accumulate.

Our two-dimensional Raman cooling is a direct exten-
sion of the one-dimensional case, where the cooling cycles
are alternatively applied to the x and the y directions.

The ﬁrst Raman cooling experiments [1, 6] used Black-
man pulses, which feature a power spectrum with very
small wings outside the central peak, hence reducing oﬀ-
resonant excitations. Although this might seem to be a
very desirable feature, later work [5] showed experimen-
tally and theoretically that square pulses, which produce
an excitation spectrum featuring signiﬁcant side lobes
and a discrete set of zeros, give a better cooling in the
one-dimensional case. It is also expected to be better in
the two-dimensional case [5, 9]. The dynamics of Raman
cooling, as well as that of VSCPT, are related to non
Gaussian statistics called L´evy ﬂights [9, 10]. More pre-
cisely, for an excitation spectrum varying as vα around
v = 0, the width of the velocity distribution scales with
the cooling time Θ as Θ−1/α. However the atoms eﬃ-
ciently accumulate in the cold peak of the distribution
when Θ
only if α is greater than or equal to the
dimensionality of the problem. Square pulses, for which
α = 2, appear to be suitable for 2D cooling, and the
present work concentrates on them.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. Laser system

≃

Raman cooling requires two laser beams whose fre-
quency diﬀerence is phase locked to a frequency close to
the hyperﬁne frequency ωHF/2π
9.2 GHz. The most
common methods used to generate the two frequencies in-
clude direct electronic phase locking of two free running
lasers [11], acousto-optic modulation [12], and electro-
optic modulation [1]. We used a diﬀerent approach
based on current modulation of a laser diode [13, 14], as
shown in Fig.2. An extended-cavity master diode laser at
852 nm, with a free spectral range of 4.6 GHz, is current-
modulated at ωHF/2 in order to generate sidebands sep-
arated by ωHF. The fraction of the power in the two ﬁrst
order sidebands, measured with an optical spectrum an-

alyzer, is about 50%. The carrier is ﬁltered out with a
solid etalon having a free spectral range of 9.2 GHz and a
ﬁnesse of 8, and the remaining beam is used to injection-
lock two slave diodes. The slave currents are adjusted in
order to lock one slave to one sideband and the other slave
to the other sideband. In the spectra of the slaves, the
total contamination from the carrier and any of the un-
wanted sidebands is less than 1% of the total power. The
phase coherence of the sidebands is fully transfered onto
the slaves and the beatnote spectrum of the two slaves is
measured [23] to be 1 Hz wide. This includes contribu-
tions from the linewidth of the microwave generator used
to modulate the master laser, the mechanical vibrations
of the laser and optical system (but not of those mirrors
after the ﬁbers), and the resolution of the measurement
apparatus. After transport in optical ﬁbers, 40 mW are
available in each Raman beam.

As pointed out previously, cooling of opposite sides of
the velocity distribution requires changing the direction
of the Raman beams. This is done by changing the injec-
tion current of the slaves so that they lock on the other
sideband [15]. The switching time, measured by mon-
itoring the transmission of each Raman beam through
a confocal cavity [15], is found to be about 50 µs for a

time of the diode current supplies. The swapping of the
beams between the x and the y directions is done with
Pockels cells and polarizing beam splitters (Fig.2), in less
than a microsecond. The extinction ratio of the Pockels
cell switches is about 100.

B. Experimental details

A magneto-optical trap inside a glass cell is loaded
with a few times 107 atoms from a chirped-slowed atomic
beam. After additional, 70 ms-long, molasses cooling,
the atoms are dropped, pumped into F = 3, and Ra-
man cooled for 25 ms, before they fall out of the Raman
beams. As shown in Fig. 3, the Raman beams are in the
horizontal plane, along the x and y axes, providing cool-
ing perpendicularly to the vertical direction. We found
that controlling the horizontality of the Raman beams
at a level of a few thousandths of a radian is enough to
ensure that gravity does not perturb the cooling, but an
error as large as 0.01 rad has a noticeable eﬀect. The
waist of the beams (radius at 1/e2 of peak intensity) is
4 mm and they all have nominally the same power. When
the atoms are dropped, they are slightly above the center
of the beams, and after 25 ms of cooling, they are at an
approximately symmetric position below.

The repumping is provided by a retro-reﬂected verti-
F ′ = 3 transition,
cal beam, tuned to the F = 4
with an intensity a few times the saturation intensity and
with the reﬂected polarization rotated in order to avoid
a standing wave eﬀect. The momentum of the photons
absorbed from the repumping beams has no eﬀect on the
transverse velocity, and leads only to momentum diﬀu-
sion in the vertical direction.

→

→

The velocity distribution along x or y is measured by
Raman spectroscopy [16], i.e. by transferring a narrow
velocity class from F = 3 to F = 4 with a long Ra-
man π pulse. Two centimeters below the Raman beams,
the atoms fall through a sheet of light tuned to the
F ′ = 5 cycling transition. The integrated
F = 4
ﬂuorescence collected by a photodiode is proportional to
the number of atoms transfered to the F = 4 state. By
scanning the Raman detuning δ for a succession of iden-
tically cooled atomic samples, one can probe all the ve-
locities and reconstruct the velocity distribution. There
is a small, uniform background signal; after subtraction
of this background, we obtain velocity distributions such
as that shown in Fig.5.

Raman cooling as described here is essentially a 3-level
scheme and our experiment requires the Zeeman sub-
levels to be degenerate within each hyperﬁne level. Good
subrecoil Raman cooling can be achieved only if any Zee-
man splitting is small compared to the Raman Doppler
shift associated with a single recoil velocity, which is
8.2 kHz. This is ensured by reducing the DC stray mag-
netic ﬁeld with an opposing applied external magnetic
ﬁeld, and further reducing the DC and AC residual ﬁelds

with a µ-metal shield. Raman spectroscopy with non-
velocity-selective, co-propagating beams and long pulses
(300 µs) is used to optimize the ﬁeld zeroing by adjusting
for minimum spectral width. The Raman spectrum has
a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 0.5 kHz, corre-
sponding to a residual stray ﬁeld smaller than 100 µG,
and equivalent to the Raman Doppler shift of atoms with
a velocity vrec/16.

The polarizations of each pair of Raman beams are
crossed-linear in order to ensure that, because the de-
tuning
is large compared to the hyperﬁne splitting
(600 MHz) of the excited state, the light shifts are nearly
the same for all the Zeeman sub-levels of the ground
state [17]. Under those conditions, the eﬀective electri-
cal dipole coupling Ω corresponding to an intensity I has

1.1 mW/cm2 is the saturation intensity for the strongest
transition. The Raman detuning δ has to be negative to
cool the atoms, and is chosen in such a way that atoms
with a zero velocity are resonant with the ﬁrst zero point
of the excitation spectrum [24]. We extend Eq.(1) by

this into account, one would have to write Eq.(2) in the
form of Eq.(1), and replace I in the deﬁnition of ΩR with
√I1I2.

The detuning δ depends on the light intensity in two
diﬀerent ways. Firstly, there is the diﬀerential light shift
δLS between the two hyperﬁne levels, which is propor-
tional to the light intensity I. Secondly, according to
Eq.(3), the frequency of the ﬁrst zero of the excitation
spectrum changes due to a “saturation” eﬀect, as soon as
ΩRt is not small compared to 1, that is to say when the
maximum transfer probability is not small compared to
unity. These dependences on the light intensity lead to
complications because the Raman beams have a Gaussian
proﬁle and are never perfectly spatially homogeneous.
Depending on their position in the beams, diﬀerent atoms
have diﬀerent resonance conditions. In previous experi-
ments [5, 18], the diﬀerential light shift was reduced by
using a detuning ∆ large compare to the hyperﬁne split-
ting ωHF, and the saturation eﬀect was reduced by setting
the maximum transfer probability to 0.5, thus using π/2
pulses instead of π pulses.

Because of a limitation in the available laser power, we
worked at a detuning
of only 20 GHz, with pulses hav-
ing a maximum transfer eﬃciency of 80% (0.7π-pulses).
As shown below, although not negligible, the saturation
shift and the light shift partially cancel out, thus limiting
unwanted excitation of the dark state.

∆
|
|

We measure the excitation spectrum by determining
the transfer eﬃciency of such Raman pulses as a function
of the Raman detuning δ, with non-velocity-selective co-
propagating beams. Figure 4 shows the excitation spec-
trum when the atomic cloud is centered on the Raman
beams (a), resulting in a fairly homogeneous illumina-
tion, and when the cloud is on the edge of the beams

(b), resulting in an inhomogeneous illumination. The
arrows show the position of the Raman detuning corre-
sponding to the dark state. Because the light shift and
the saturation respectively shift and broaden the spec-
trum, locations in the cloud exposed to diﬀerent light
intensities yield diﬀerent positions and shapes of the ex-
citation spectrum. The spectra of the individual atoms
contribute inhomogeneously to the measured spectrum.
In both case (a) and (b), it appears that the spectrum
is not fully symmetric and that the ﬁrst minimum on
the positive detuning side does not go as close to zero
as does the minimum corresponding to the dark state.
This comes from the fact that the saturation and the
light shift have opposite eﬀects on the position of the
zero on one side of the spectrum, and similar eﬀects on
the other side. This eﬀect becomes very visible in the
inhomogeneous illumination case. However, the cancel-
lation is not perfect, and the dispersion of the Raman
coupling through the dependence of
on the Zeeman
sub-level also leads to a “blurring” of the spectrum. As
a result, the dark state features a small excitation proba-
bility, even in the homogeneous illumination case. On the

IV. RESULTS

−

The elementary Raman cooling cycle is a 50 µs square
Raman pulse with the ω1 beam along some direction, e.g.
+x (as in Fig. 1), and the ω2 beam along the opposite di-
rection, e.g.
x, followed by a 10 µs resonant repumping
pulse from counter-propagating beams along z. In this
example, the elementary cycle provides cooling along the
+x axis. The rise and fall times of the Raman pulse are
less than 1 µs. In our experiment, the elementary cool-
ing cycles are applied in pairs along a given direction.
A complete cycle consists of 4 pairs of elementary cool-
ing cycles applied successively along the directions +x,
x. The full cooling sequence is typically
+y,
composed of 40 complete cycles.

As pointed out previously, the switching time between
perpendicular directions, limited by Pockels cell switch-
ing, is instantaneous with respect to the experimental
timescale, but the switching time between parallel direc-
tions is 50 µs. Using pairs of identical elementary cycles
reduces the total number of complete cycles, and thus
reduces the total time spent switching the beams. There
is almost no loss of eﬃciency resulting from the applica-
tion of two successive elementary cycles along the same
direction because after only a few complete cooling cy-
cles, the velocity distribution becomes narrow enough so
that the atoms are in the tail of the excitation spectrum
and the excitation probability per Raman pulse is small
compared to 1 for most of the atoms.

Immediately after the cooling, the velocity distribu-
tion is probed with a 500 µs square π pulse applied
along the x or the y axis. Figure 5 shows the veloc-
ity distribution measured along the x axis after 320 ele-
mentary cycles (40 complete cycles), corresponding to a
22.4 ms cooling sequence. The velocity spread, deﬁned as
σ = FWHM/√8 ln 2, is reduced from about 4 vrec after
molasses cooling, corresponding to an eﬀective tempera-
ture of 300 µK, to 0.39(5) vrec [25], corresponding to an
eﬀective temperature of 30 µK. Note that a 20% con-
tribution from the probe excitation linewidth is removed
by deconvolution. A similar velocity distribution is mea-
sured along the y axis, and more than 50% of the total
number of atoms are in the cold peak. The rest of the

atoms are mostly localized around velocities correspond-
ing to the other zeros of the excitation spectrum.

An important issue is the isotropy of the velocity distri-
bution in the cooling plane. The cooling scheme is funda-
mentally anisotropic, and we only measured the velocity
spread along the cooling directions x and y. However
there are good reasons to believe that the peak of cold
atoms at the center of the ﬁnal distribution is isotropic
(in two dimensions). As indicated in [10], the dynamics
of each individual atom is dominated by fairly distinct
phases, where it either performs a random walk in ve-
locity space outside the subrecoil range, or stays close to
the dark state, in the subrecoil range, until it gets ex-
cited and resumes the random walk. The argument for a
ﬁnal isotropic velocity distribution relies on two consid-
erations. Firstly, the total excitation probability for an
atom close to the dark state during a complete cycle is
isotropic. Indeed, close to the null velocity, the excitation
probabilities for an elementary cycle along
y are
small compared to 1 and proportional respectively to v2
x
and v2
y (power law with a coeﬃcient α = 2), leading to
a total excitation probability for the complete cycle pro-
portional to the sum v2
y. This probability only
depends on the “distance” vr from the dark state, and
is therefore isotropic. Secondly, atoms excited from the
subrecoil range perform several steps during their ran-
dom walk before going back to the subrecoil range at
a random point which is uncorrelated with the previous
position they occupied close to the dark state.

The combination of the eﬀectively isotropic excitation
of the subrecoil atoms and the homogeneous ﬁlling of the
subrecoil region should produce an isotropic cold peak.

tion in the x

FIG. 6: Velocity spread σ as a function of the cooling time
Θ. The straight line is the power law βΘ−1/2
, whose mul-
tiplicative factor β has been adjusted manually to make the
line ﬁt the data at long times.

We also studied the experimentally measured velocity
spread σ as a function of the cooling time Θ. The results
are shown on Fig. 6. As stated in section III, subre-
coil cooling theory predicts that the velocity spread is
described at long times by the power law Θ−1/α, where
α is the excitation spectrum power law coeﬃcient. Our
data do not cover a range of cooling times large enough
to fully enter the asymptotic regime, and to allow an ac-
curate experimental determination of α. However, Fig. 6
shows that our data is compatible with cooling dynamics
described by the theoretical power law Θ−1/2 (α = 2) at
long times.

It is expected that because of the experimental im-
perfections, the velocity spread would eventually reach
a ﬁnite value at long times. Nonetheless, Fig. 6 does
not show any evident saturation, which indicates that a
longer cooling time, for instance in micro-gravity, would
lead to an even smaller velocity spread.

To keep the cooling sequence simple, we use Raman
pulses with a ﬁxed length. The choice of 50 µs-long pulses
is convenient because the resulting excitation spectrum
covers most of the initial velocity distribution, and more
importantly, covers the maximum excursion range of the
atoms during their random walk. Indeed, an atom close
to zero velocity can be pushed away from the center of
the velocity distribution by a maximum amount of about
4 vrec: two recoil velocities during the Raman transition
plus one or two (or exceptionally more) during the re-
pumping process. The excitation spectrum covers 5 vrec
between the two ﬁrst zeros.

It should be possible to use longer pulses (narrower
excitation spectrum) in combination with short pulses
(wider excitation spectrum) that recycle atoms far from
zero velocity [5]. The increased ﬁltering eﬀect of longer
pulses produces an narrower distribution at the cost of a

smaller number of atoms in the cold peak. In any case,
the best cooling strategy results from a tradeoﬀ between
the width of the distribution and the fraction of atoms
in the cold peak, and depends on the total cooling time
available.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Our scheme produces a narrower velocity distribution
with respect to the recoil velocity than what was previ-
ously achieved with 2D Raman cooling [6]. There are
two main diﬀerences from that previous scheme, where
the cooling was performed in a vertical plane, from the
four directions at the same time. First, we use one pair of
Raman beams at a time, in order to avoid unwanted ex-
citation of the dark state. Indeed, in Ref. [6], the careful
use of circular polarization avoided diﬀracting the atoms
from standing waves created by counter-propagating
beams of the same frequency, but higher order pho-
ton transitions of the type (ω1, k)(ω2,
k)
would still be able to transfer 4 vrec to the atoms. Second,
since we cool in the horizontal plane, gravity has no eﬀect
on the velocity components which are being cooled and
does not accelerate atoms out of the cold peak, allowing
for a more eﬀective cooling.

To be used in an cold-atom atomic clock, Raman cool-
ing has to be coupled with a launching mechanism like
moving molasses. An easy solution is to ﬁrst launch the
atoms and then collimate them with Raman cooling on
their way towards the ﬁrst microwave cavity. The cooling
time depends on the size of the Raman beams and the
launch speed.

In that perspective, our setup performs quite well in
comparison with a newer scheme relying on sideband
cooling in optical lattices [19], which has produced po-
larized samples with a velocity spread of 0.85 vrec in 3D,
in a fountain-like geometry [20]. While it is appealing for
its simplicity, sideband cooling has a fundamental limit
for the lowest velocity spread achievable, which is about
0.7 times the recoil velocity associated with the wavevec-

7

tor of the lattice used to trap the atoms [21]. Raman
cooling has no such a limitation.

It is worth noticing that, although deeply subrecoil ve-
locities are obtained for long cooling times, only accessi-
ble in micro-gravity, 2D Raman cooling can still provide
subrecoil velocities in a few milliseconds, as shown in
Fig. 6. Implementing the scheme on a moving-molasses
earth-bound fountain, where a 1.5 cm-interaction region
with the Raman beams combined with a typical launch
velocity of 5 m/s leads to an interaction time of 3 ms,
would yield a substantial improvement in terms of bright-
ness of the atomic source, reducing the transverse veloc-
ity spread from a few recoils to less than a recoil velocity.
For a micro-gravity-operated atomic beam, the im-
provement would be even more dramatic because the
launch velocity can be much smaller than in a fountain,
making the interaction time with the Raman beams much
longer. The maximum cooling time is more likely to be
limited by the maximum longitudinal heating acceptable.
How the increase of brightness translates into an increase
of the stability of a space-borne atomic clock depends
on geometrical details and on the factors which actually
limit the stability and/or the accuracy . For simplicity,
let us assume that the atomic cloud is severely clipped
by the opening of the second microwave cavity, as is the
case in current fountain clocks, and that the signal-to-
noise ratio is the main limiting factor of the stability [26].
Reducing the transverse velocity spread from 2 vrec to
0.4 vrec (our current result) would increase the ﬂux of
atoms through the cavity by a factor of 25. That would
translate into a 5-fold increase of the signal-to-noise ratio,
leading to a 5-fold increase of the stability of the clock.

[23] The linewidth of the beatnote spectrum was measured

by recording the beating of the two beams on a fast pho-
todiode. The photo-signal was mixed with the signal of
an auxiliary microwave generator tuned to a frequency
close to 9.2 GHz. The mixing signal was analyzed with
an FFT spectrum analyzer.

[24] The Raman detuning δ is experimentally adjusted (by
optimizing the ﬁnal velocity distribution) in such a way
that the velocity class resonant with the ﬁrst zero point
of the excitation spectrum is the same when we cool both
sides of the velocity distribution. However, because we do
not know precisely the value of the light shifts, nor do we
have a perfect calibration of δ, such a dark state is not
necessarily the zero velocity state. In fact, this degree of
freedom can be used to tune the direction of propagation
of the atoms after the cooling.

[25] Uncertainties quoted in this paper represent one standard
deviation, combined statistical and systematic uncertain-
ties.

[26] One could choose instead to take advantage of the im-
proved collimation by reducing the initial number of
atoms launched in order to reduce the collisional shift,
which is a major source of inaccuracy in laser cooled Ce-
sium atomic clocks. However, recent developments [22]
suggest that the collisional shift can be accurately mea-
sured and accounted for.

The ﬁnite nuclear size correction to the bound–electron g factor in hydrogenlike atoms is in-
vestigated in the range Z=1-20. An analytical formula for this correction which includes the non-
relativistic and dominant relativistic contributions is derived. In the case of the 1s state, the results
obtained by this formula are compared with previous non-relativistic analytical and relativistic nu-
merical calculations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent experiments on measuring the bound-electron g factor in hydrogenlike carbon (C5+) reached an accuracy
of about 2 · 10−9 [1,2]. The same accuracy is expected to be achieved soon for some other low-Z ions. To obtain the
corresponding precision in the theoretical predictions for the bound-electron g factor, the relativistic, QED, nuclear
recoil and nuclear size corrections must be evaluated (see [3–6] and references therein). In the present paper we derive
a relativistic formula for the ﬁnite nuclear size correction to the bound-electron g factor in the case of an arbitrary state
of a hydrogenlike atom. This formula provides a suﬃciently accurate evaluation of the correction under consideration
in the range Z = 1–20. In the case of the 1s state, the results obtained by this formula are compared with the results
obtained by the related non-relativistic formula [7] and with the results of the relativistic numerical evaluation [4].

The relativistic units (¯h = c = 1) and the Heaviside charge unit (α = e

4π , e < 0) are used in the paper.

II. BASIC FORMULAS

We consider a hydrogenlike atom, placed in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, ~A(~r) = [ ~B × ~r]/2. We assume that the
interaction of the electron with the magnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than the ﬁne structure splitting and much larger
than the hyperﬁne structure splitting, if the nucleus has a nonzero spin. The energy shift of a level a to the ﬁrst order
in the magnetic ﬁeld is

where

Assuming that the vector ~B is directed along the z axis, the energy shift reads

where µ0 = |e|
g factor. In the case of a point-charge nucleus a simple calculation, based on the Dirac equation, yields [8]

2m is the Bohr magneton, mj is the z-projection of the angular momentum, and g is the bound-electron

Here κ = (−1)j+l+ 1

The sum (2.8) can be evaluated analytically using the method of the generalized virial relations for the Dirac equation
proposed in [10]. Equations (3.26)–(3.29) of Ref. [10] can be written as

(En′κ − Enκ)hn′κ|rs|nκi = −shn′κ|iσyrs−1|nκi ,

We assume that the nuclear charge distribution is described by a spherically symmetric density ρ(~r) = ρ(r), which is
normalized by the equation

where ∆ is the Laplace operator. When integrated with VF, the radial functions g(r) and f (r) can be approximated
by the lowest order term of the expansion in powers of r. It follows we have to evaluate the integral

The Poisson equation gives

Using the identity

2 states. In the case of the 1s state, the expression (2.30) coincides with the related formula in [7].

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

In Table 1 we compare the ∆g values for the 1s state obtained by formula (2.29) with the non-relativistic results
of Ref. [7] (it corresponds to equation (2.30) of the present paper) and with the relativistic numerical results of Ref.
[4]. To calculate hr2 log ri in equation (2.29), we considered the homogeneously charged sphere model for the nuclear
charge distribution. As one can see from the table, the relativistic contribution to ∆g becomes comparable with
the current experimental accuracy for ions with Z ≥ 12. It will be also important for lower Z ions, provided the
experimental accuracy is improved by an order of magnitude.

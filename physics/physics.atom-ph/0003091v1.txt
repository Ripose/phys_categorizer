Abstract

A laser-cooled neutral-atom beam from a low-velocity intense source is split into

two beams while guided by a magnetic-ﬁeld potential. We generate our multimode-

beamsplitter potential with two current-carrying wires on a glass substrate combined

with an external transverse bias ﬁeld. The atoms bend around several curves over

a 10-cm distance. A maximum integrated ﬂux of 1.5 · 105atoms/s is achieved with

a current density of 5 · 104Ampere/cm2 in the 100-µm diameter wires. The initial

beam can be split into two beams with a 50/50 splitting ratio.

Like their optical counterpart, atom beamsplitters are the pivotal element of atom-optical

interferometers. While the original beamsplitter was perhaps the Stern-Gerlach apparatus1,

modern free-space beamsplitters are based on mechanical or light-based refractive elements.

Such beamsplitters have been used with good success in Mach-Zehnder interferometers to

measure the Sagnac-eﬀect with high sensitivity2,3. Free-space beamsplitters are generally

characterized by small splitting angles because the eﬀective grating spacing is large compared

to the atomic de Broglie wavelength.

A waveguide-based beamsplitter has the potential to provide arbitrary splitting angles.

Furthermore, the conﬁning potential of a waveguide also suppresses the beam divergence and

gravitational sag to which free-space interferometers are subjected. Several atom-guiding
schemes using magnetic forces have been proposed and demonstrated4–10. We recently

demonstrated guiding a beam of laser-cooled atoms around a curve11 using magnetic forces

from photolithographically patterned current-carrying wires. The multimode-atom beam-

splitter reported on here is a natural extension of our previously demonstrated guiding

scheme. Like its ﬁber and integrated optical counterparts, our waveguide beamsplitter

merges and then diverges two guiding regions.

We guide 87Rb atoms in a weak-ﬁeld-seeking state along a magnetic-ﬁeld minimum. This

magnetic guide leads atoms around several curves to a beamsplitter region. Our beamsplitter

region consists of two such magnetic-ﬁeld minima that merge to one ﬁeld minimum and

separate again into two minima. A variable fraction of atoms initially launched into one

of the two magnetic ﬁeld minima are guided and transferred into the second magnetic ﬁeld

minimum at the beamsplitter region.

For our atom source we prepare a laser-cooled beam of 87Rb atoms with a modiﬁed vapor-

cell magneto-optical trap (MOT)12. To generate our low-velocity intense source (LVIS)13

we drill a 500-µm hole in the center of a retro-reﬂecting mirror placed inside our vacuum

chamber [Fig. 1(d)]. We couple LVIS atoms into our magnetic guide by positioning the guide

opening directly behind the mirror hole. The atom’s internal state and velocity distributions

are as measured previously11,14.

We generate our one-dimensional guiding potential by adding an external transverse bias

ﬁeld to the magnetic ﬁeld generated by a 100×100-micron current-carrying wire on a glass

substrate7,8,10. The vector sum of the transverse bias ﬁeld ~Bbias and the wire’s magnetic ﬁeld

2

~Bwire becomes zero at a position outside the wire, if the bias ﬁeld is smaller than the ﬁeld

generated by the wire at its surface [Fig. 1(a)]. As the bias ﬁeld is increased (decreased)

the position of the magnetic ﬁeld minimum moves linearly toward (away from) the wire

and the potential depth increases (decreases). Furthermore, when the wire’s magnetic-ﬁeld

maximum is twice the transverse bias ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld zero is 50-µm above the

current-carrying-wire surface and the ﬁeld magnitude increases linearly with displacement

in the transverse directions. We generate the transverse bias ﬁeld for the guide with an

electromagnet placed near the substrate [Fig. 1(d)]. An additional ∼14-G longitudinal bias

ﬁeld is applied to prevent the magnetic-ﬁeld magnitude from vanishing at the ﬁeld minimum.

As the wire current and bias ﬁeld are increased proportionally the magnetic-potential depth

and gradient increase linearly, but the ﬁeld-minimum position remains unchanged.

With current only in the wire positioned right behind the mirror hole, wire 1, and a

86-G external bias ﬁeld applied we guide atoms and measure atom ﬂux versus wire current

for diﬀerent bias ﬁelds. In this guiding experiment we run 35-msec-long current pulses of

up to 5.5 A at a 1 sec repetition rate through wire 1. We choose short current pulses to

prevent the glass substrate from overheating, allowing us to run larger wire currents than a

continuous current would allow. After the atoms exit the guide, they are ionized by a hot

wire and the subsequent ions are then detected by a channeltron. For each external bias-ﬁeld

value there is an optimum track current that maximizes the guided-atom ﬂux [Fig. 2(a)].

For wire currents too large the magnetic-ﬁeld minimum is shifted far away from the wire

resulting in a reduced ﬁeld gradient. This ﬁeld-gradient reduction helps to couple atoms into

the guide opening, but also leads to guiding losses as atoms can no longer be guided around

the curves of the guide. When the track current is too low the generated magnetic-ﬁeld

gradient is suﬃcient to bend the atoms around the curve, but the ﬁeld minimum is close

to the wire surface and atom-surface interactions as well as a tighter guide opening result

in a lower ﬂux. Our guiding ﬂux peaks when the condition for mode matching atoms into

the guide opening and maintaining a suﬃcient gradient to bend atoms around the curves is

3

optimized.

We measure the heating of guided atoms by comparing the transverse velocities before

and after the guiding process. At a wire current of 5.0 A and a transverse bias ﬁeld of

∼ 86 G we measure the guided-atoms’ transverse-velocity proﬁle by translating the hot

wire transverse to the propagation direction to map out the spatial extent of the atom

beam as it diverges from the guide exit [Fig. 2(b)]. The 70-µm-diameter hot wire is placed

∼ 2.5 cm from the output of the magnetic guide. We calculate that the atoms’ emergence

from the conﬁning ﬁelds of the guide is almost completely non-adiabatic—the transverse

kinetic energy of the emerging beam should thus be a faithful reﬂection of the transverse

kinetic energy in the guide. From the width of the ﬁt in Figure 2(b) we determine that the

transverse-velocity distribution of the guided atoms is vt = 17.2 ± 3.5 cm/sec, in contrast

to an initial transverse velocity of vt = 10.0 ± 1.5 cm/s of LVIS. We attribute the observed

heating to the non-adiabatic loading of the LVIS atoms into the guide. An atom that enters

the guide displaced from the magnetic ﬁeld minimum experiences a sudden increase in its

potential energy because it is not mode-matched to the guide. The additional potential

energy increases its total energy inside the guide, which is converted into transverse kinetic

energy once the atom leaves the guide. We believe this heating eﬀect can be ameliorated by

adiabatically loading the atoms into a tapered guide.

Once atoms are guided along the one-dimensional magnetic-ﬁeld minimum we turn on

our beamsplitter. As we increase the current running through wire 2 we observe that the

ﬂux from guide 2 increases and the ﬂux out of guide 1 decreases. Figure 3(a) shows the ﬂux

of guided atoms coming out of each guide versus the current ratio between the two wires.

As we change this current ratio we can tune the splitting ratio of our beamsplitter. We

observe a dynamic range of the splitting ratio from 100/0 to 15/85. A 50/50 beamsplitter is

achieved when the current in wire 2 is 85% of the current in wire 1. Aside from the current

ratio there are two other parameters that determine the splitting ratio of our beamsplitter.

First, as we change the applied transverse bias ﬁeld we can vary the degree of overlap of

the two magnetic ﬁeld minima. For very large bias ﬁelds the two minima remain close to

4

their respective wires and their overlap is small in the beamsplitter region. Second, the

curvature of the guides in the beamsplitter region determines the manner in which the two

magnetic-ﬁeld minima merge. In our design the atoms are preferentially switched over into

the secondary guide due to the wire curvature in the beamsplitter region. The guides bend

with a radius of curvature of ∼30 cm into the splitter region and curve away with a radius

of ∼70 cm. A calculation of our potential-minima trajectories shows that for this curvature

the ﬁeld minima follow straight lines that cross (Fig. 4). This means that atoms launched

into guide 1, the primary guide of our beamsplitter, are more likely to switch over into

guide 2, the secondary guide, than to continue along guide 1. This geometric feature of our

beamsplitter is responsible for its bias toward coupling atoms into guide 2. Our experimental

data shows that at a current ratio of 0.85 between guide 2 and guide 1 we compensate for

the geometric bias of our beamsplitter and achieve 50/50 beamsplitting. As we increase the

current in wire 2 to a current larger than in wire 1 the ﬂux out of guide 2 peaks at a current

ratio Iwire2/Iwire1 = 1.1 and decreases again beyond this value. This decrease is analogous

to the observation in 2(a) where we found a decrease in guided-atom ﬂux for wire currents

in a non-optimum Bwire/Bbias-ratio regime.

We sum the ﬂux from the output of both guides and ﬁnd the total ﬂux to remain roughly

constant. This observed ﬂux conservation of our beamsplitter as shown in Figure 3(a) is a

strong function of the transverse bias ﬁeld applied. For a current in wire 1 of 5.0 A and

a longitudinal bias ﬁeld of 14 G a transverse bias ﬁeld of ∼ 86 G is necessary to achieve

a constant total ﬂux as the current ratio is varied. This is 35% larger than the optimum

bias ﬁeld measured for maximum guiding eﬃciency when only one wire carries current.

We postulate that the increased bias ﬁeld separates the two magnetic ﬁeld minima in the

beamsplitter region making it easier for atoms to follow guide 1 instead of guide 2.

We model our beamsplitter design with a numerical simulation and ﬁnd qualitative agree-

ment with our measured data. The simulation calculates the classical trajectories of 2.5×106

atoms through our beamsplitter potential and records which guide each atom exits [Fig.

3(b)]. The test atoms’ spatial initial conditions are spread over a 100 × 100-µm aperture

5

centered 60 µm above the wire and their initial velocities match the LVIS-velocity distribu-

tion at the guide opening. We use constant bias ﬁelds of 100 G in the transverse and 14 G

in the longitudinal direction for the simulation shown. In our experiment these values are

not constant along the entire guiding region, which limits the accuracy of our simulation.

The simulation shows that more atoms are coupled into guide 2 than remain in guide 1

when the currents in both wires are equal, which conﬁrms our idea that the beamsplitter

is biased toward guide 2 by its geometric design. Further, a 50/50 beamsplitting is shown

at a current ratio of 0.75, which compares well within the errors of the simulation to the

measured current ratio of 0.85. Our simulation also shows a decrease in ﬂux out of both

guides at the largest current ratios as observed in our experiment.

In summary, we have split a beam of laser-cooled atoms while guided in a magnetic-ﬁeld

potential. We are able to vary the ratio of atoms coupled into the secondary guide from

0 to ∼85% by varying the current in wire 2. We demonstrate that moderate currents give

guiding potential depths of several millidegrees Kelvin. In the future the question of coherent

beamsplitting will have to be addressed. While coherence has been well established for free-

space atom interferometers it has yet to be demonstrated that our waveguide beamsplitter

preserves coherence.

(a-c) We show a

cross-sectional cut across the wires. When a bias ﬁeld is applied transverse to the wires the mag-

netic ﬁeld becomes zero just above the wire surface (a). For large track separations (d=300µm) the

magnetic ﬁeld minima do not merge (b). As the track spacing is reduced (d=100µm) the magnetic

ﬁeld minima merge to form one ﬁeld minimum (c). The transverse bias ﬁeld is generated with an

electromagnet near the wire substrate (d). The LVIS mirror hole is aligned with one of the wires

to couple the LVIS atoms into the guide.

the propagation direction to map out the transverse-velocity distribution. We use the width of the

around 6 mm is an artifact due to some stray LVIS atoms that contaminate the guided-atom-beam

proﬁle. Those data points appear negative due to a background-subtraction procedure.

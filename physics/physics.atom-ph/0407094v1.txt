Abstract. We present a detailed model describing the eﬀects of wire corrugation on the trapping potential
experienced by a cloud of atoms above a current carrying micro wire. We calculate the distortion of the
current distribution due to corrugation and then derive the corresponding roughness in the magnetic
ﬁeld above the wire. Scaling laws are derived for the roughness as a function of height above a ribbon
shaped wire. We also present experimental data on micro wire traps using cold atoms which complement
some previously published measurements and which demonstrate that wire corrugation can satisfactorily
explain our observations of atom cloud fragmentation above electroplated gold wires. Finally, we present
measurements of the corrugation of new wires fabricated by electron beam lithography and evaporation of
gold. These wires appear to be substantially smoother than electroplated wires.

1 Introduction

Magnetic traps created by current carrying micro wires
have proven to be a powerful alternative to standard trap-
ping schemes in experiments with cold atoms and Bose-
Einstein condensates [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. These so-called ”atom
chips” combine robustness, simplicity and low power con-
sumption with strong conﬁnement and high ﬂexibility in
the design of the trapping geometry. Integrated atom op-
tics elements such as waveguides and atom interferometers
have been proposed [8] and could possibly be integrated
on a single chip using fabrication techniques known from
microelectronics. Quantum information processing with a
single atom in a micro trap has also been proposed [9].

Real world limitations of atom chip performance are
thus of great interest. Losses and heating of atoms due
to thermally exited currents inside conducting materials
composing the chip were predicted theoretically [10,11]
and observed experimentally soon after the ﬁrst experi-
mental realizations of atomic micro traps [12,13].

An unexpected problem in the use of atom chips was
the observation of a fragmentation of cold atomic clouds in
magnetic micro traps [14,5]. Experiments have shown that
this fragmentation is due to a time independent roughness
in the magnetic trapping potential created by a distortion
of the current ﬂow inside the micro wire [15]. It has also
been demonstrated that the amplitude of this roughness

a Present address: Universit¨at Hannover, D 30167 Han-

nover, Germany

increases as the trap center is moved closer to the mi-
cro wire [16]. Fragmentation has been observed on atom
chips built by diﬀerent micro fabrication processes using
gold [17] and copper wires [14,5], and on more macro-
scopic systems based on cylindrical copper wires covered
with aluminum [16] and micro machined silver foil [18].
The origin of the current distortion inside the wires caus-
ing the potential roughness is still not known for every
system.

In a recent letter [17], we experimentally demonstrated
that wire edge corrugation explains the observed poten-
tial roughness (as theoretically proposed in [19]) in at least
one particular realization of a micro trap. In this paper, we
will expand on our previous work giving a more detailed
description of the necessary calculations as well as present-
ing a more complete set of experimental observations. We
emphasize that extreme care has to be taken when fab-
ricating atom chips, and that high quality measurements
are necessary to evaluate their ﬂatness in the frequency
range of interest. We will discuss the inﬂuence of corru-
gations both on the edges as well as on the surface of the
wire and give scaling laws for the important geometrical
quantities like atom wire separation and wire dimensions.
We will also present preliminary measurements on wires
using improved fabrication techniques.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we give
a brief introduction to magnetic wire traps and empha-
size that the potential roughness is created by a spatially
ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld component parallel to the wire.
In section 3, we give a general framework to calculate the

rough potential created by any current distortion in the
wire. A detailed calculation of the current ﬂow distortion
due to edge and surface corrugations on a rectangular wire
is presented in section 4. In section 5, we apply these cal-
culations to the geometry of a ﬂat wire, widely used in
experiments. Edge and surface eﬀects are compared for
diﬀerent heights above the wire and we present impor-
tant scaling laws that determine the optimal wire size for
a given fabrication quality. In section 6 and 7, we show
measurements of the spectra of edge and surface ﬂuctua-
tions for two types of wires produced by diﬀerent micro
fabrication methods: optical lithography followed by gold
electroplating and direct electron beam lithography fol-
lowed by gold evaporation. We also present measurements
of the rough potential created by a wire of the ﬁrst type
using cold trapped Rubidium atoms.

conﬁnement, which is the main motivation for miniatur-
izing the trapping structures. However the magnetic ﬁeld
roughness arising from inhomogeneities in the current den-
sity inside the wire also increases as atoms get closer to
the wire. This increase of potential roughness may prevent
the achievement of high conﬁnement since the trap may
become too corrugated.

Before turning to the calculations of the rough mag-
netic ﬁeld, we emphasize that only the z component of
the magnetic ﬁeld is relevant to the potential roughness.
A variation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the (x, y) plane will
cause a negligible displacement of the trap center, whereas
a varying magnetic ﬁeld component Bz modiﬁes the lon-
gitudinal trapping potential, creating local minima in the
overall potential [17].

2 Magnetic micro traps

The building block of atom chip setups is the so-called
side wire guide [8]. The magnetic ﬁeld created by a straight
current carrying conductor along the z axis combined with
an homogeneous bias ﬁeld B0 perpendicular to the wire
creates a two-dimensional trapping potential along the
wire (see ﬁgure (1)). The total magnetic ﬁeld cancels on a
line located at a distance x from the wire and atoms in a
low ﬁeld seeking state are trapped around this minimum.
For an inﬁnitely long and thin wire, the trap is located
at a distance x = µ0 I/(2 π B0). To ﬁrst order, the mag-
netic ﬁeld is a linear quadrupole around its minimum. If
the atomic spin follows adiabatically the direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic potential seen by the atoms
is proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Consequently, the potential of the side wire guide grows
linearly from zero with a gradient B0/x as the distance
from the position of the minimum increases.

For a straight wire along z, all magnetic ﬁeld vectors
are in the (x, y) plane. Three dimensional trapping can be
obtained by adding a spatially varying magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponent Bz along the wire. This can be done by bending the
wire, so that a magnetic ﬁeld component along the central
part of the wire is created using the same current. Alter-
natively, separate chip wires or even macroscopic coils can
be used to provide trapping in the third dimension.

For a realistic description of the potential created by
a micro wire, its ﬁnite size has to be taken into account.
Because of ﬁnite size eﬀects, the magnetic ﬁeld does not
diverge but reaches a ﬁnite value at the wire surface. For
a square shaped wire of height and width a carrying a
current I, the magnetic ﬁeld saturates at a value propor-
tional to I/a, the gradient reaches a value proportional to
I/a2. Assuming a simple model of heat dissipation, where
one of the wire surfaces is in contact with a heat reservoir
at constant temperature, one ﬁnds the maximal applica-
ble current to be proportional to a3/2 [20]. Therefore, the
maximal gradient that can be achieved is proportional to
1/√a. This shows that bringing atoms closer to smaller
wires carrying smaller currents still increases the magnetic

3 Calculation of the rough magnetic ﬁeld
created by a distorted current ﬂow in a wire

In this section, we present a general calculation of the ex-
tra magnetic ﬁeld due to distortions in the current ﬂow
creating the trapping potential. By j we denote the cur-
rent density that characterizes the distortion in the cur-
rent ﬂow. The total current density J is equal to the sum
of j and the undisturbed ﬂow j0 ez. As the longitudinal
potential seen by the atoms is proportional to the z com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld, we restrict our calculation
to this component. We thus have to determine the x and
y component of the vector potential A from which the
magnetic ﬁeld derives. In the following, we consider the
Fourier transform of all the quantities of interest along
the z axis which we deﬁne by

Al,k(x, y) =

Al(x, y, z) e−

i k z dz ,

where we have used the vector potential as an example
and l stands for x or y, L being the length of the wire. We
choose this deﬁnition so that the power spectral density of
a quantity coincides with the mean square of its Fourier
transform :

The vector potential satisﬁes a Poisson equation with

where jl is one component of the current density j. In
the following, we use cylindrical coordinates deﬁned by
x = r cos(ϕ) and y = r sin(ϕ). Outside the wire, the right
hand side of equation (3) is zero. The solution of this 2D
heat equation without source term can be expanded in
a basis of functions with a given ”angular momentum”

linear combination of modiﬁed Bessel functions of the ﬁrst
kind In and of the second kind Kn. Thus expanding Al,k
on this basis, we obtain the following linear combination
for the vector potential

We retain only the modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second
kind, since the potential has to go to zero as r goes to in-
ﬁnity. The cln (k) coeﬃcients are imposed by equation (3),
and can be determined using the Green function of the 2D
heat equation [21]. We obtain

(6)
This expression is valid only for r larger than r0, the ra-
dius of the cylinder that just encloses the wire. At a given
distance x from the wire, we expect that only ﬂuctuations
with wavelengths larger or comparable to x contribute to
the magnetic ﬁeld, since ﬂuctuations with shorter wave-
lengths average to zero. Therefore we can simplify expres-
sion (6) assuming we calculate the magnetic ﬁeld above
the center of the wire (ϕ = 0) for x much larger than r0.
The argument of In in equation (5) is very small in the do-
main of integration and we can make the approximation
(k r)n/(2n n!). This shows that the cln coeﬃ-

cients decrease rapidly with n. Keeping only the dominant

We will see in the next section that the ﬁrst factor of this
expression, characterizing the distortion ﬂow, is propor-
tional to the power spectral density of the wire corruga-
tion. The second factor peaks at k
1.3/x justifying the
expansion. Fluctuations with a frequency much smaller
or much larger than 1/x are ﬁltered out and do not con-
tribute. As we approach the wire, more and more terms
have to be added in the series of equation (6) to compute
the magnetic ﬁeld. We emphasize that the expressions de-
rived in equations (6) and (7) are general for any distorted
current ﬂow that may arise from bulk inhomogeneities or
edge and surface corrugations.

4 Calculation of the distorted current ﬂow in
a corrugated wire

We now turn to the calculation of the distortion in the
current ﬂow due to wire edge and surface corrugations in
order to determine the associated cln coeﬃcients. We sup-
pose the wire has a rectangular cross section of width W0
and height u0 as shown on ﬁgure (1). Let us ﬁrst con-
centrate on the eﬀect of corrugations of the wire edges,
which denote the borders perpendicular to the substrate.
Figure (2) shows that, in our samples, these ﬂuctuations
are almost independent of the direction x both for wires
deposited by electrodeposition and by evaporation. We
believe this result to be general for wires fabricated by
a lithographic process, since any defect in the mask or
in the photoresist is projected all along the height of the
wire during the fabrication process. Thus, in the follow-
ing, the function fr/l that describes the deviation of the
right (respectively left) wire edge from
W0/2 is assumed
to depend only on z.

ﬁes the Laplace equation ∆V = 0. As we are interested in
deviations from the mean current density j0 = I/(u0 W0),
we introduce the electric potential v = V
j0 z/χ which is
equal to zero in the absence of deviations. From what we
have said above, v only depends on y and z and satisﬁes
the 2D Laplace equation. The boundary conditions for the
current density on the wire edge impose the current to be
parallel to the wire edge. Thus v satisﬁes

Symmetry arguments show that only the part of fS(y, z)
which is odd in y contributes to the magnetic ﬁeld along z
in the plane y = 0. An even component of fS produces a
current distribution which is invariant by axial symmetry
with respect to the plane y = 0. Therefore, they cannot
contribute to Bz in this plane. Thus, only the Fourier com-

The potential v satisﬁes the 2D Laplace equation, so the
k component vk(y) is a linear combination of e+k y and

ary conditions of equation (9). To complete the calcula-
tion of these two coeﬃcients, we introduce the symmetric
component f + = (fr + fl)/2 and antisymmetric compo-
fl)/2 of the wire edge ﬂuctuations. Going

We note that the symmetric part (ﬁrst term) of the cur-
rent deviation is maximal near the wire edges for compo-
nents with a wave vector large compared to 1/W0. On the
other hand, the components with a small wave vector are
constant over the width of the wire.

We now turn to the calculation of the current distor-
tions due to surface corrugation. We assume the bottom
surface to be ﬂat, since the wire is supposed to be fabri-
cated on a ﬂat substrate. We denote by fS the ﬂuctua-
tions of the height of the wire from its mean value u0 (see
ﬁgure (1)). We follow the same procedure as for the calcu-
lation of the eﬀect of the wire edge ﬂuctuations. Now v is
the electrical potential associated with the current density
j due to the surface corrugation. It depends on x, y and
z and satisﬁes the 3D Laplace equation. To ﬁrst order in
fS, the boundary conditions of a current tangent to the

5 Rough potential of a ribbon shaped wire

In this section, we combine the results of the two previ-
ous sections to compute the z component of the rough
magnetic ﬁeld in the speciﬁc case of a ﬂat rectangular
W0). This simpliﬁcation enables us to obtain
wire (u0 ≪
analytical results for a system that is widely used in ex-
periments [1,2,3,5,7,18].

We do the calculation on the x axis for x > W0/2.
Since the wire is considered as ﬂat, we replace the volume
current density j by a surface current density σ =
j dx.
Then we can rewrite the cln coeﬃcients as

We will ﬁrst study the eﬀect of wire edge ﬂuctuations and
give universal behaviors for the magnetic ﬁeld roughness.
We will then concentrate on the eﬀect of the top surface
roughness. We will compare the relative importance of the
two eﬀects and point out important consequences for the
design of micro wires.

5.1 Eﬀect of wire edge roughness

Let us ﬁrst study the eﬀect of wire edge ﬂuctuations. Here
we derive the same results as [19] in a diﬀerent way. The
distorted current ﬂow has no component along the x axis.
The expression of the rough magnetic ﬁeld is then given
by the ﬁrst sum of equation (6). Taking ϕ = 0, we can
rearrange this sum using the equalities Kn(kr) = K
n(kr)
1)ncyn (see equation (18)), we then obtain

(19)

Since only the cyn with even n contribute, we see from
equation (18) that only the symmetric part of the current
density participates to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is what we
expect from a simple symmetry argument. For the cy2n
coeﬃcients we obtain

As pointed out in the previous section, the sum over the
angular momenta n in equation (19) converges rapidly
with n if x
W0. More precisely, the dominant term pro-
portional to K1(k x) gives the correct result within 10%
as soon as x > 1.5 W0. As x approaches 0, more and more
terms contribute, and for x = W0/2, 20 terms have to be
taken into account to reach the same accuracy.

vectors k
1/W0 are relevant. Then we can approximate
the integral in equation (20) by expanding the integrand
to zeroth order in k y. Keeping the dominant term in the
series that deﬁnes the magnetic ﬁeld, we obtain the fol-
lowing expression for the response function

R(k, x)

(µ0I)2
4π2x4 (k x)4K 2

≃

1 (k x) .

(21)

For a given height x, as k increases, this function increases
from zero as k2, peaks at k = 1.3/x and ﬁnally tends ex-
ponentially to zero. This behavior can be understood as
follows. At low wave vectors, the angle between the direc-
tion of the distorted current ﬂow and the z axis tends to
zero, thus the contribution of these components becomes
negligible. At high wave vectors, ﬂuctuations with a wave
length shorter than the distance to the wire average to
zero.

To check the validity of equation (21), we plot the di-
mensionless function R(k, x)/[(µ0I)2/(4π2x4)] for diﬀer-
ent ratios x/W0 in ﬁgure (3). The limit function corre-
sponds to a conﬁguration where the distorted current ﬂow
is concentrated on the line x = y = 0. For a smaller dis-
tance from the wire, the ﬁnite width of the wire becomes
important and R(k, x) diﬀers from the expression (21).
The amplitude is smaller and the peak is shifted to a lower
frequency. These eﬀects are due to the fact that as x de-
creases, the distance to the borders of the wire decreases
less rapidly than the distance to the central part of the
wire because of the ﬁnite width of the wire. Furthermore,
because corrugations of high wave vector produce a cur-
rent density localized near the wire border, their decrease
in amplitude is more pronounced.

Assuming a white power spectrum of the wire edge
corrugations with a spectral density J +
e , we can integrate
the equation (21) over the whole spectral range. We then
ﬁnd the following scaling law for the rms ﬂuctuations of
Bz with the atom-wire distance x:

and tends to a constant. Note that here J +

densities obtained by integration over x have remarkably
simple forms. We ﬁnd

Comparing edge and surface corrugation, we see that
for large distances, both eﬀects scale in the same way (see
equations (22) and (27)). However, at short distances from
the wire, the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld roughness
produced by surface corrugation does not saturate. In-
deed, although the contribution of σ(2)
yk,m saturates in the
same way as the eﬀect of wire edge ﬂuctuations, the con-
tribution of σ(1)
yk,m to the current density diverges as one
gets closer to the wire. Thus at small distances from the
wire, we expect surface roughness to become the dominant
source of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

5.3 Consequences for micro wire traps

The scaling laws (22) and (27) are of major importance as
they impose strong constrains in the use of micro traps.
As mentioned in section 2, high magnetic ﬁeld gradients
are achieved with small wires and short distances. But as
the distance to the wire decreases, the roughness in the
magnetic trapping potential increases. Imposing a maxi-
mal roughness ∆Bmax tolerable in an experiment there-

More precisely, as mentioned in section 2, the maxi-

we consider the trap center at a distance comparable to
W0 and the wire height u0 is small and
the wire width x

wire roughness to be independent of the wire dimensions

6 Probing the rough magnetic potential with
cold atoms

In a previous letter [17], we described measurements of the
magnetic ﬁeld roughness produced by a current carrying
micro fabricated wire. The basic idea is to use the fact that
the longitudinal density n(z) of atoms along the wire, is
related to the longitudinal potential seen by the atoms
through a Boltzmann factor:

n(z)

e−

V (z)/kBT .

∝

(31)

As discussed in section 2, the potential V (z) is propor-
tional to the z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld a the cen-
ter of the trapping potential. Our typical thermal energy,
1 µK, corresponds to a magnetic ﬁeld of 70 µG for a 87Rb
atom in the F = 2, mF = 2 state. Since longitudinal den-
sity variations of order 10% are easily visible in our exper-
iment, we are sensitive to variations in the magnetic ﬁeld
at the mG level.

The micro wire we used to create the magnetic po-
tential is a 50 µm wide electroplated gold wire of 4.5 µm
height. The process of micro fabrication is the following:
a silicon wafer is ﬁrst covered by a 200 nm silicon dioxide
layer using thermal oxidation. Next, seed layers of tita-
nium (20 nm) and gold (200 nm) are evaporated. The wire
pattern is imprinted on a 6 µm thick photoresist using op-
tical UV lithography. Gold is electroplated between the
resist walls using the ﬁrst gold layer as an electrode. The
photoresist is then removed, as well as the ﬁrst gold and
titanium layers. Finally the wire is covered with a 10 µm
layer of BCB resin and a 200 nm thick layer of evaporated
gold. The gold surface acts as a mirror for a magneto-
optical trap. The procedure for deducing the potential
roughness from images of the atomic cloud is complex and
we refer the reader to [17].

Figure (6) shows the measured longitudinal potential
for various distances above the wire. We also show the
power spectral density of these potentials in ﬁgure (7). A
region of 1.6 mm along the wire is explored by the atoms.
To estimate the power spectral density of the potential
roughness we divide the total window in three smaller
windows overlapping by 50% [22]. In each window, the
fourier transform of the potential is computed after mul-
tiplication with a Hamming window and the estimate of
the spectral density is the average of the square of the
Fourier transforms.

In ﬁgure (7), a ﬂat plateau is visible at the highest wave
1
1 at 46 µm and k > 0.04 µm−
vectors (e.g. k > 0.07 µm−
at 80 µm). The level of this plateau depends on experi-
mental parameters such as the temperature and density of
the atom cloud. On the other hand the spectral density at
low wave vectors, i.e. in the region where it rises above the

plateau, is independent of these parameters. This obser-
vation leads us to conclude that while the low wave vector
part of the spectrum corresponds to a potential seen by
the atoms, the plateau at high wave vectors is due to in-
strumental noise in our imaging system, such as fringes.
We expect it to vary in a complex way with tempera-
ture and atom density. Qualitatively, smaller atom-wire
distances, which are analyzed with higher temperature
clouds, should result in higher plateaus. This tendency
is indeed observed in ﬁgure (7).

×

To measure the wire corrugations, we removed the
atom chip from vacuum and etched oﬀ the gold mirror
and the BCB layer. We analyzed the bare wire with scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) and with atomic force
microscopy (AFM) techniques. The function f describ-
ing the edge corrugation is extracted from SEM images
such as (2b). Rms deviations of the edges are as small
as 200 nm, and we use a 50 µm
50 µm ﬁeld of view
in order to have a suﬃcient resolution. We use 66 over-
lapping images to reconstruct both wire edges over the
whole wire length of 2.8 mm. We identify no correlation
between the two edges. The spectral density obtained for
f + = (fl + fr)/2 is plotted in ﬁgure (8). We see two
structures in the spectrum: ﬁrst, we observe ﬂuctuations
with a correlation length of 0.2 µm and 100 nm rms ampli-
tude. It corresponds to the ﬂuctuations seen on ﬁgure (2b)
which are probably due to the electrodeposition process.
Second, roughness with low wave vectors is present and
raises signiﬁcantly the power spectral density in the 0.01-
1, the
1 range. For the spectral range 0.01-1 µm−
0.1 µm−
wire border ﬂuctuations are well ﬁtted by a power law
4 µm3 as seen in ﬁg-
J = 3.2
ure (8). We use this expression to compute the spectra
shown in ﬁgure (7). As we measured f over the whole re-
gion explored by the atoms, we can not only compare the

8 Conclusion

Fig. 9. Power spectral density of the wire top surface rough-
ness measured with an AFM. We plot the spectral density cor-
responding to the transverse mode m = 1 (ky = 2π/W0) which
is the ﬁrst one to contribute to magnetic ﬁeld roughness. The
horizontal line indicates the mean value for kz ranging from
0.2 µm

−1 to 0.1 µm

Our results indicate that the magnetic ﬁeld roughness
measured with cold atoms is explained by wire corruga-

tion. At low wave vectors (k < 0.04 µm−
the magnetic ﬁeld roughness is primarily due to edge cor-
rugations. The good agreement between the observed ﬁeld
and the calculation shown in ﬁgure (6) are the strongest
evidence for this conclusion. For wave vectors larger than
1, the corrugations of the top surface are
about 0.5 µm−
expected to contribute as strongly as those of the edges.
This wave vector regime however, is not being stringently
tested by our data. Since we have no data on surface corru-
1, it is possible that
gation at wave vectors below 0.1 µm−
the contribution from this eﬀect is larger than shown in
ﬁgure (7). The atom data in the ﬁgure however, indicate
that the surface eﬀect is not the dominant one although
given our signal-to-noise it could be of comparable mag-
nitude.

7 Improved fabrication process for micro
wires

The fabrication technology described above limits us to
atom wire separations greater than several tens of mi-
crons if we want to obtain a reasonably smooth potential.
In order to improve the quality of our wire, we turn to
a diﬀerent micro fabrication process: the wire structures
are patterned onto an oxidized silicon wafer using elec-
tron beam lithography. We use gold evaporation and a
standard lift-oﬀ technique to obtain 700 nm square cross
section wires as shown in ﬁgure (2c).

We extract the wire border roughness from SEM im-
ages and the obtained power spectral density is plotted in
ﬁgure (8) (lower curve). In the spectral range studied, the
roughness is greatly reduced compared to the ﬁrst fabrica-
tion process. This was expected as the grain size of evapo-
rated gold is much smaller than of electroplated gold. Un-
fortunately, we do not have a quantitative measurement of
1 range. In-
the power spectral density in the 0.01-0.1 µm−
deed, as we had to reduce the ﬁeld of view to increase the
resolution, it becomes very diﬃcult to overlap hundreds
of SEM pictures without adding spectral components due
to stitching errors.

Gold evaporation produces surfaces of optical quality
at visible light. Thus the roughness of the top surface of
the evaporated wire is expected to be much smaller than
that of an electroplated wire.

Our goal in this paper has been to give a more detailed de-
scription of the work which led to our conclusion that wire
corrugations can account for the magnetic ﬁeld roughness
typically observed in atom chip experiments. We wish to
emphasize in this paper that great care must be taken to
characterize the roughness of a micro fabricated wire. The
ratio of the rms roughness to the wavelength of the im-
4. Thus a single microscope image
perfections is below 10−
cannot reveal the imperfections.

The model we use has already been suggested in ref-
erence [19]. Here we have given more details of the calcu-
lation as well as some physical arguments explaining the
results. We have also extended the calculation to include
the eﬀects of corrugations of the top surface of the wire.
The top surface corrugations become increasingly impor-
tant as the distance to the wire decreases, while the eﬀect
due to wire edge roughness saturates.

The equations (22) and (27), giving the behavior of the
magnetic ﬁeld roughness due to edge and surface corru-
gation as a function of height, are important scaling laws
that one should keep in mind in the design of atom chips.
The requirements of small roughness and high transverse
conﬁnement impose a tradeoﬀ in choosing a wire size for a
given fabrication quality. We do not believe however that
we are at the end of our progress in improving the fabri-
cation technology [20]. Thus sub-micron scale atom chips
continue to hold out much promise for the manipulation
of ultra cold atoms.

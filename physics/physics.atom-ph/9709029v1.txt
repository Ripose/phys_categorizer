We report the ﬁrst direct observation of excited state muon transfer in hydro-
gen/deuterium mixtures by direct measurement of q1s, the probability that a
µp atom, which is initially formed in an excited state, reaches the 1s ground
state. The dependence of q1s on deuterium concentration cd was measured for
two diﬀerent densities at cryogenic temperatures using charge coupled devices
(CCDs) to detect the muonic X rays. First results based on the analysis of
the Kα-lines of the two isotopes are presented.

One of the longstanding problems regarding the muonic cascade and muon catalyzed
fusion (µCF) in mixtures of hydrogen isotopes is the poor understanding of excited
state transfer of the muon. Excited state transfer largely inﬂuences the initial popu-
lation of muonic atoms in the ground state, the starting point for a complex sequence
of processes leading to muon catalyzed fusion [1, 2, 3, 4].

After a free muon is injected into a hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) or tritium (T)
target, it is slowed down, and an excited muonic atom is formed [5, 6]. Rapid deex-
citation to the ground state follows via various competing collisional and radiative
processes [7]. In the ﬁrst approach the fraction of muons reaching the 1s level of
the lighter isotope was considered to be proportional to the atomic concentration
[8] until the importance of the possibility of a fast excited state transfer e.g.
pµ(nl) + d =⇒ p + dµ(nl′) + 135/n2eV

(p=proton, d=deuteron) which can compete with the other cascade processes was
pointed out [9]. A strong dependence on density Φ, concentration cd, and collision
energy ǫ was predicted for q1s. (q1s denotes the probability that a µp atom, which is
initially formed in an excited state, reaches the 1s ground state.) Several calculations
of this functional dependence q1s(Φ, ci) have been published for the H/D, H/T and
D/T mixtures in the last decade [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

Until now, no direct measurement of q1s has been performed. The only experimental
results on q1s so far have been obtained by indirect methods (“cycling rate analysis”)
in the case of DT-fusion e.g. Ref.[4].

Therefore, we performed an experiment in H/D mixtures [16] using an entirely
new approach based on the observation of the µp and µd X-ray intensities. The
small energy diﬀerence and the very low energy of these muonic X rays (energy of
Kpµ

α = 2.0 keV) were the main challenges of this measurement.

α = 1.9 keV, Kdµ

This experiment took place at the high intensity muon beam of the µE4 area at PSI
(Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland). The setup is shown in ﬁgure 1. The
incoming muon beam was deﬁned by scintillation counters and an aluminum beam
aperture with a radius of 35 mm for liquid (45 mm for gas) measurements. A muon
momentum of ∼38 MeV/c (∼29 MeV/c) was selected for the liquid (gas) runs.

Special silver-coated steel target cells have been developed for this experiment.
12.5µm thick Kapton foils were used as target windows for the measurements at
liquid hydrogen density. For the gas measurements, 25µm thick Kapton windows
had to withstand pressures of up to 6 bar at temperatures around 30 K. The shape
of the windows was optimized to allow eﬃcient detection of low energy X rays. The
rest of the target cell was surrounded by superinsulation to reduce radiation heat-
ing. Another 12.5µm thick Kapton window separated the vacuum vessel from the
vacuum of the charge coupled devices (CCDs) in order to protect the detector.

2

A new gashandling system was built for the preparation of the various H/D mixtures.
The pressure and temperature of the target were monitored continually. During the
measurements, various samples of the target content were extracted using a small
capillary leading directly from the target to a quadrupole mass spectrometer [17] in
order to determine the relative abundance of the two isotopes.

For the ﬁrst time, CCDs [18, 19] have been employed for the observation of the
muonic hydrogen X rays. Due to their excellent background suppression [20, 21, 22]
they provide a unique mean for the detection of X rays in this low energy region.
The size of each of the two CCD chips used was ∼ 25x17mm2 [23]. The main chip
component was silicon with small absorption layers of SiN3 and SiO2 on the surface
[23]. The depletion region had a thickness of ∼ 30µm. To shorten the read-out time,
each CCD chip was split into two electronically independent detection areas.

“Single pixel analysis” was used for the separation of “true” X-ray hits from charged
particles or cosmic background. A “single pixel hit” was considered to be a “true”
X ray if the charge content of the surrounding 8 neighbour pixels was statistically
compatible with the noise peak of the CCDs [22, 24].

Figure 2 shows the observed energy spectra of muonic deuterium, muonic hydrogen,
and of an isotopic mixture at liquid hydrogen density. The small peak visible at 1.74
keV is the electronic Kα-line of silicon due to ﬂuorescence of the CCD-materials. In
the mixture with cd = 0.25 the eﬀect of excited state transfer can clearly be seen.
Without considering excited state transfer, one would expect the intensity of the
deuterium Kα-line to be about half of the adjoining Kpµ
α -line (taking into account a
∼ 40% diﬀerence in overall detection eﬃciency).

hydrogen

In the “standard model” of the muonic cascade [5, 7, 25] the contribution of non-
radiative processes to the ground state deexcitation is suggested to be only a few
percent [7, 26]. This allows to determine q1s in H/D mixtures by disentangling the
intensities of the µp and µd K-lines. In this ﬁrst analysis we considered only Kα
intensities. Furthermore, the atomic capture probability was considered to be equal
for hydrogen and deuterium [8]. (Cohen et al. [6] calculated a diﬀerence of ∼ 6%.)
This approach yields

The energy spectra were analysed using Gaussians to ﬁt the peak areas. While
the peak positions were treated as free parameters, the FWHM of the Gaussian
distributions was constrained to obey the energy relation

factor (∼ 0.12), E ... energy of the X ray [eV])
which is valid for Si-detectors [20, 21]. A µ+ run and an empty target run proved
that there were no background peaks visible within the observed energy region.
Therefore the background function could be approximated by the sum of a constant
and a term depending linearly on energy. The CERN MINUIT program package
[27] was employed for the ﬁtting procedure.

An analysis of the obtained data requires the precise knowledge of the energy depen-
dence of the detector eﬃciency. A Monte Carlo program [28] was written to account
for the various contributions to X-ray absorption by target content, windows, and
CCD materials. The calculation of the intrinsic detection eﬃciency of the CCDs
and the X-ray absorption of the Kapton foils was checked experimentally [29].

In our measurement we clearly observed a change in the muonic X-ray intensity
pattern of the hydrogen and deuterium cascade in isotopic mixtures at various deu-
terium concentrations and densities. This can be directly attributed to the existence
of excited state transfer during the muonic cascade. Our results for the q1s values at
diﬀerent densities are displayed as a function of deuterium concentration in ﬁgure
3. Statistical errors and systematic errors due to uncertainties in the eﬃciency of
the setup contribute to the given error bars. The data point at 20% deuterium
concentration is the result of a previous test experiment [22, 30]. For liquid hydro-
gen density the solid line demonstrates the theoretical expectation of Ref.[11] for a
collision energy ǫ = 1 eV, the dotted line shows the calculation of Ref.[11] for ǫ = 6
eV, and the dashed line was calculated in Ref.[12].

The data clearly reveal that the dependence of q1s on deuterium concentration is
much weaker than predicted by standard cascade theory. Various new ideas were
published recently which oﬀer alternative explanations and show better agreement
with our results at liquid hydrogen density. Czaplinsky et al. [11] assumed higher
collision energies ǫ of the muonic atoms. New calculations of the muonic cascade
in hydrogen [25] suggest that the energies of the muonic atoms - inﬂuenced by
various cascade processes - are distributed in a complex way, especially Coulomb
deexcitation processes have to be taken into account. The resulting values for q1s
are given in ﬁg.3 (dashed-dotted line) [15]. A new mechanism for deexcitation of the
muonic atom via an excited (dtµ)∗ molecule was proposed in [13, 14] which suggests

4

an alternative non-radiative transition to the ground state. The existence of this
“resonant sidepath” in the µCF-cycle - up to now one calculation exists for D/T
mixtures only - would inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the theoretical expectation for q1s and
its dependence on cd.

Within error limits, our results agree with the ones obtained by analysis of cycling
rates in the case of D/T mixtures given in Ref.[4].

Figure 4 displays the density dependence of q1s at diﬀerent deuterium concentrations.
A large diﬀerence between data taken at liquid hydrogen density and at 1% of LHD
can be seen. A more detailed result on the density dependence of q1s is expected
from the ﬁnal analysis, which will include measurements at 4% and 8% of LHD.

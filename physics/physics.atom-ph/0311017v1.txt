Abstract

The coherent and non-coherent scattering eﬀects on ”backward”

parametric X-ray radiation by relativistic electrons in a crystal on the

basis of the method of functional integration is investigated. A com-

parison of contributions of these eﬀects to parametric X-ray radiation

line width has been considered. It is shown that in a number of cases

the major contribution to the line width of parametric X-ray radiation

is made by non-coherent multiple scattering.

PACS: 11.80.La, 31.15.Kb, 32.70.Jz, 33.70.Jz

1. The diﬀerent coherent and interference radiation eﬀects are possible

when a relativistic electron moves at a small angle with respect to one of

the crystallographic axes in a crystal [1,2]. Due to these eﬀects the spectral-

angular radiation density has sharp maxima with high radiation intensity.

One of these eﬀects is Parametric X-ray Radiation (PXR) [2, 3, 4, 5]. This

radiation is caused by particle ﬁeld scattering on nonuniformities of lattice

permitivity and mainly concentrated in direction close to the Bragg direction

of particle ﬁeld reﬂection from crystalline planes of atoms. Of special interest

is ”backward” PXR when an electron falls at a small incidence angle to one

of the crystallographic axes (z-axis), beacuse in this case the contribution

of other kinds of radiation such as coherent and channeling radiation are

considerably suppressed. The coherent and channeling radiation are largely

concentrated in the line of particle motion. Narrow lines then appear in the

spectral-angular radiation density as a result of the interference of irradiated

waves by electron at interaction with crystalline planes of atoms oriented

normally to z-axis. Experimental studies of PXR line widths have shown [5]

that the line widths were, however, much larger than the natural PXR line

width. Performed analysis of experimental data in [5, 6] is shown that the

multiple scattering must make considerable inﬂuence on line width of PXR.

In [6] a theory of the line width of ”backward” PXR based on the method

of functional integration was suggested. On the basis of this theory in [6] the

simplest case of the multiple scattering eﬀect on the PXR spectral-angular

characteristics was considered in which multiple scattering was studied only

in continuous ﬁeld of the crystal atomic strings.

This paper is devoted to investigation of non-coherent multiple scat-

tering eﬀect of particles on the line width in a crystal. Oﬀered averaging

method in [6] over PXR spectral-angular density is generalized to the case,

when coherent and non-coherent eﬀects in particle multiple scattering on

atomic strings are took into account. It is shown that this problem in many

respects is similar to the problem of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal eﬀect

of multiple scattering on coherent bremsstrahlung of high energy electrons

in a crystal and in an amorphous medium [1, 7, 8, 9, 10]. On the basis of ob-

tained formulas a comparison of contributions of coherent and non-coherent

multiple scattering of particles in a crystal to PXR line width is veriﬁed. It

is considered the case for which the non-coherent multiple scattering makes

the major contribution to the PXR line width.

2. We shall investigate ”backward” PXR when relativistic electrons fall

at a small incidence angle ψ with respect to one of the crystallographic axes

(z-axis). Narrow lines then appear in the spectral-angular radiation density

caused by particle ﬁeld reﬂection from the crystallographic planes of atoms

where L is target thickness, ψ = (ψx, 0) is two-dimensional vector in the
(x, y) plane normally to z-axis deﬁning angle ψ = |ψ| between falling particle

velocity vector and z-axis (it is proposed that beam falls to the crystal in

the (x, y) plane) and θ = (θx, 0) is the angle at which radiation occurs.(we
are interested in radiation in the (x, y) plane in the region of angles θx close
to the direction of Bragg reﬂection of waves; θ counts oﬀ from perpendicular

to the crystal surface on which beam falls).

The value ǫωn,g in (1) is the Fourier component of lattice permittivity.
In our case the permittivity nonuniformity along x- and y-axes is inessential

to radiation. ǫωn,g is, therefore, formed only by permittivity non-uniformity
along the z-axis

Eq. (1) was derived taking into account both target thickness and small

deviations of the particle trajectory in crystall from linear one. Obtaining

(1) it was supposed that the medium permittivity is close to unity and also

photon absorption was neglected. The ﬁnite size of crystal leads us, as is

well [5, 6], to the natural line width of PXR. Small deviations of electron

trajectory in crystal from linear one is caused by both particle plane chan-

neling eﬀect and multiple scattering on non-uniformities of lattice potential.

The plane channeling eﬀect is absent when electrons fall at a small incidence

angle with respect to one of the crystallographic axes (see [1] for example).

In this case multiple scattering on atomic strings of crystal parallel to the

z-axis leads us to the deviation of particle trajectory from linear one.

Under conditions |θ − ψ| ≫ |v⊥(t)| the dependence of preexponential
factor on random value v⊥(t) can be ignored. Such dependence in (1) ap-
pears as a result of action of diﬀerential operators on the functional Φ(v⊥(t).

Relativistic electron scattering in a crystal when an electron falls at a

small incidence angle ψ to crystallographic axis is caused by both coherent

and non-coherent particles scattering on lattice atoms. Coherent scattering

is mainly along azimuthal angle in the (x, y) plane, orthogonal to the z-

axis [1]. A redistribution of particles over this angle occurs as a result of

multiple scattering by diﬀerent atomic strings.

If ψ ≫ ψc, the multiple
scattering is a Gaussian process with the mean square of multiple scattering
angle θ2 = qcL (here ψc =

is the critical angle of axial channeling, d

where

and

is the interatomic distance along z-axis, ǫ is the particle energy) [1]. Non-

coherent scattering at ψ ≫ ψc mainly occurs as a result of particle scattering
angle by thermal displacement of atom positions in lattice. In this case the

mean square of multiple scattering angle is close to the value of this one
in an amorphous medium θ2

a = qaL. Thus, particle trajectory deviation
along the y-axis, orthoganal to the (z, v) plane, is caused by both coherent

and non-coherent particle scattering in crystal with mean square of multiple
scattering angle θ2

y = qyL where qy = qc+qa/2. Particle deviation then along
x-axis is caused by non-coherent scattering with mean square of multiple
scattering angle θ2

x = qxL, where qx = qa.

Random values v⊥x(τ ) and v⊥y(τ ) in (8) can be factorized. The average
value of function Φ(t, t′) then can be written as the prudoct of average
magnitudes hΦ(t, t′)i = hΦxi · hΦyi. Since in our case scattering process is a
Gaussian, we can write hΦxi in terms of functional integration

where t = N ∆, t′ = k∆, vn is scattering angle at time tn = n∆ and
θr = θ − ψ. (Here we use v ≈ 1.)

In our geometry θ and ψ are situated in the (x, y) plane. In this case

the value hΦyi can be derived from hΦxi if we replace qx in hΦxi by qy and
use θr = 0.

The functional integral (9) has the same structure as the corresponding

integral in the theory of Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal multiple scattering

eﬀect on bremsstrahlung of high energy electrons in an amorphous medium.

Integral (9) can be therefore calculated by the method developed in [9, 10].

3.Eq. (10) shows that the inﬂuence of multiple scattering on ”backward”

PXR is determined by the parameters σx, σy and α. We shall consider some
extreme cases.

If σx → 0 and σy → 0 the multiple scattering inﬂuence on PXR can be
ignored. The function F = F0 then determines the natural line width of
PXR

F0 =

sin2(ω − ωn)L
((ω − ωn)L)2

The line width in this case is given by ∆ω ∼ 1/L to within the order of

magnitude.

At σx → 0 Eq. (10) gets over in corresponding results [6].(we note that
qy is related in the Eq. (13) of the work [6] by means of ratio qy = q/2. The
value θ2 then in the [6] must be determined by the ratio θ2 = qL/2 = qyL)
In this case if σy ≫ 1 the line width to within the order of magnitude is
given by

If σy ∼ σx ≫ 1 the major contribution to integral over u in (10) at α ≫ 1
can be made by uef f ∼ 1/ασx ≪ 1.(We use here that the inequality α ≫ 1
is the validity condition of Eq. (5).) Neglecting the values of order 1/ασx
we can rewrite (10) in the next form

the energy ǫ = 855 MeV moved in a silicon crystal at a small angle to the
h111i axis, the value ασx at θr ∼ 5 · 10−3 rad is ασx ∼ 40n.

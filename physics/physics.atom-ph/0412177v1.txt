We report the results of ab initio relativistic correlation calculation of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld on
the electron in the ground state of the HI+ molecular ion. This value is required for interpretation
of the suggested experiment on search for the electron electric dipole moment. The generalized
relativistic eﬀective core potential and relativistic coupled cluster methods are used, followed by
nonvariational one-center restoration of the four-component wavefunction in the core of iodine.

Introduction.

It is known [1] that existance of the per-
manent electric dipole moments (EDM) of the elementary
particles violate two fundamental symmetries: space par-
ity (P) and time reversal (T). Considerable experimental
eﬀorts invested recently to the search for the electron
EDM de (see [2, 3]) are primarily connected with the
high sensitivity of de to the “new physics” beyond the
Standard Model (see [4] and references). Polar diatomic
molecules with heavy atoms and nonzero projection of
the total electronic momentum on the molecular axis (see
below) are currently considered as the most prospective
objects to search for de because of the great value of the
eﬀective electric ﬁeld acting on the unpaired electrons in
the ground or excited states of such molecules [5, 6]. The
only nonzero component of eﬀective electric ﬁeld in po-
lar diatomics is the one directed along the molecular axis
and it is traditionally marked by Wd (see [7] for details).
Calculation of the Wd value is needed for any experiment
on the de search using molecules. The theoretical meth-
ods developed recently (see [8] and references therein)
allow one to calculate Wd for any diatomic molecule of
practical interest with required accuracy, even for such
complicated system as excited states in PbO [9, 10].

Recently the e-print by Ravaine et al. was published
in LANL archive [11] where the authors discussed the
inﬂuence of the chemical bond nature on the value of
Wd in two molecular ions, HBr+ and HI+. Correspond-
ing experiment was suggested by Stutz and Cornell [12].
In the present article, we report the results of ab initio
calculation of the Wd parameter for the ground state of
HI+, leaving along the discussion about sensitivity of the
suggested experiment.

In [11] the authors modelled electronic structure of HI+
by two limiting approximations: “ionic” and “covalent”,
where “ionic” approximation corresponds to a neutral
iodine atom electrostatically perturbed by a proton. The
latter is located at the experimental equilibrium distance
from the iodine nucleus determined for the HI+ ground
state. The “covalent” limit corresponds to the I+ ion
perturbed by the electrostatic ﬁeld from the dipole of
the polarized neutral H. We are using inverted commas to
mark the approximations since from the traditional point
of view they both correspond rather to ionic bonding but

with the opposite signs of molecular dipole moments. It
was found that the value of Wd is greatly changed (about
six times) depending on the approximation made (either
“ionic” or “covalent”).

In realistic model of HI+ some intermediate bonding

rather takes place.

Further we will use atomic units unless the opposite
is stated explicitly. The terms of interest for HI+ in the
eﬀective spin-rotational Hamiltonian may be written fol-
lowing Ref. [7]. The P,T-odd interaction of de with the
eﬀective electric ﬁeld Wd is given by

Hd = Wd de(J · n),

where J is the total electronic momentum and n is the
unit vector along the molecular axis from I to H. In [11]
slightly diﬀerent form of Hd is used:

Hd = Wd(J · n),

so the value of de appeares explicitly in their ﬁnal result
for Wd.

The eﬀective operator

is used to express the interaction of de with the inner
molecular electric ﬁeld E (σ are the Pauli matrices), to
avoid large numerical cancelation of the terms with op-
posite signs because of Schiﬀ’s theorem [13]. After av-
eraging over the electronic coordinates in the molecular
wavefunction, one obtains

WdΩ =

where ΨΩ is wavefunction for the X 2Π3/2 state and Ω is
the projection of J to the molecular axis.

Methods and calculations. A 25-electron generalized
relativistic eﬀective core potential (GRECP) for iodine
(its gaussian expansion can be found on our website [14])
is used at the ﬁrst step of the two-step calculations of
HI+, so that the inner shells of the iodine atom (from 1s
to 3d) are absorbed into the GRECP and the 4s, 4p, 4d,

TABLE I: Calculated parameter WdΩ (in ×1024 Hz/(e·cm))
for the ground state X 2Π3/2 of 127IH+. The one-center ex-
pansion by s, p, d spinors on the iodine core is used in the
NOCR scheme.

5s, and 5p electrons (as well as one electron of hydrogen)
are treated explicitly. Two calculations are carried out.
In the ﬁrst one, the only seven external electrons of iodine
are correlated whereas its 4s, 4p, 4d shells are “frozen”
within the GRECP approach when employing the level-
shift technique [15]. Thus, a 7-electron GRECP version
is, in fact, used in the ﬁrst series of the HI+ calculations.
In the other calculation, all the 25 electrons are explic-
itly correlated. The terms with the leading conﬁgura-
tions σ2π3 are calculated where σ and π are the highest
occupied molecular orbitals. The correlation spin-orbit
basis sets are optimized in atomic two-component rela-
tivistic coupled cluster calculations of iodine with sin-
gle and double cluster amplitudes (RCC-SD) using the
scheme suggested in [16, 17]. As a result, the basis
[5s5p3d2f 1g] was generated. For hydrogen, the reduced
[4s3p2d] correlation-consistent basis [18] was used.

The HI+ calculations start from a one-component SCF
computation of the molecular ground state of HI using
the spin-averaged GRECP (AREP) for iodine.

Two-component RCC-SD molecular calculations in the
Fock space are then performed (the details on the Fock-
space RCC-SD method can be found in Ref. [19] and
references therein). The program package rccsd [20] is
used in all RCC calculations mentioned further in the
article. The Fock-space RCC calculations start from the
ground state of HI and use the scheme:

HI → HI+

(4)

Since we are interested in the spin-dependent proper-
ties determined mainly by the electronic wavefunction
near the iodine nucleus, the shape of the valence and
outer core four-component molecular spinors are restored
in the inner core of iodine that is done in the paper by
using the nonvariational one-center restoration scheme
(NOCR) (see [8, 15, 21, 22] and references therein).

The RCC-SD calculation of Wd employs the ﬁnite ﬁeld

method (see Refs. [22, 23, 24]).

Results and discussion. The results of the RCC-SD
calculations for 7 and 25 correlated electrons of HI+ are
presented in Table I. The internuclear distance is 3.082
a.u. which is equal to 1.632 ˚A, in accord to the experi-
mental datum [25].

The results of our RCC-SD calculation give essentially

2

smaller Wd value than the one obtained in [11] by con-
ﬁguration interaction (CI) calculation for the “covalent”
approximation. One can see that accounting for correla-
tions with the core electrons (occupying the shells 4s, 4p
and 4d) decreases the absolute value of Wd. There can be
several reasons for such behaviour. As was demonstrated
in [26], the relaxation of the core shells in HgF derived
from the 5s, 5p shells of Hg due to correlations with the
5d electrons of Hg decreases the value of Wd on about
40%. In turn, the direct contribution of the 5s, 5p shells
polarized by the unpaired valence electron increases Wd
on about 50%, thus giving ﬁnally 10% enhancement of
Wd. That kind of suppresion could take place also for
HI+. Another reason for the Wd decreasing can be that
the valence shell of iodine is occupied by not a particle
(valence electron, as is in HgF, YbF etc.) but rather by
a hole in the valence π shell. Thus, contribution from the
polarization of the molecular core shells to Wd can be of
the opposite sign in comparison to the valence contribu-
tion (though, both above discussed schemes of the core
contribution, of course, require additional checking).

We consider our result for seven correlated electrons
as upper limit for WdΩ. Conservative estimate for lower
limit is −0.05×1024 Hz/(e·cm), where we suggest 50% for
the error bound as we had for excited states of PbO using
RCC-SD method. Further improvements in basis set and
application of corrections suggested in [17, 27] could im-
prove the accuracy of the calculation on the level of 10%
or even higher. In any case, our calculations show that
the value for Wd in X 2Π3/2 of HI+ is much lower than for
the metastable a(1) state in PbO, −6.1×1024 Hz/(e·cm).
In that connection we would like to notice that the ex-
perimental scheme for the de search using HI+ has to
suggest considerable advantages in comparison to other
recently proposed experiments to be of practical interest.

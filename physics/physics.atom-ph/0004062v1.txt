fundamental constants

Abstract. One of the topical problems of contemporary physics is a possible variability
of the fundamental constants. Here we consider possible variability of two dimensionless
constants which are most important for calculation of atomic and molecular spectra (in
particular, the X-ray ones): the ﬁne-structure constant α = e2/¯hc and the proton-to-
electron mass ratio µ = mp/me. Values of the physical constants in the early epochs
are estimated directly from observations of quasars – the most powerful sources of
radiation, whose spectra were formed when the Universe was several times younger
than now. A critical analysis of the available results leads to the conclusion that
present-day data do not reveal any statistically signiﬁcant evidence for variations of
the fundamental constants under study. The most reliable upper limits to possible
variation rates at the 95% conﬁdence level, obtained in our work, read:

| ˙α/α| < 1.4 × 10−14 yr−1,

| ˙µ/µ| < 1.5 × 10−14 yr−1

on the average over the last 1010 yr.

INTRODUCTION

Contemporary theories (SUSY GUT, superstring and others) not only predict
the dependence of fundamental physical constants on energy1, but also have cos-
mological solutions in which low-energy values of these constants vary with the
cosmological time. The predicted variation at the present epoch is small but non-
zero, and it depends on theoretical model. In particular, Damour and Polyakov
[1] have developed a modern version of the string theory, whose parameters could
be determined from cosmological variations of the coupling constants and hadron-
to-electron mass ratios. Clearly, a discovery of these variations would be a great
step in our understanding of Nature. Even a reliable upper bound on a possible
variation rate of a fundamental constant presents a valuable tool for selecting viable
theoretical models.

1) The prediction of the theory that the fundamental constants depend on the energy of interac-
tion has been conﬁrmed in experiment. In this paper, we consider only the space-time variability
of their low-energy limits.

Historically, a hypothesis that the fundamental constants may depend on the
cosmological time t (that is the age of the Universe) was ﬁrst discussed by Milne [2]
and Dirac [3]. The latter author proposed his famous “large-number hypothesis”
and suggested that the gravitational constant was directly proportional to t. Later
the variability of fundamental constants was analyzed, using diﬀerent arguments,
by Gamow [4], Dyson [5], and others. The interest in the problem has been revived
due to recent major achievements in GUT and Superstring models (e.g., [1]).

Presently, the fundamental constants are being measured with a relative error
of ∼ 10−8. These measurements obviously rule out considerable variations of the
constants on a short time scale, but do not exclude their changes over the lifetime
of the Universe, ∼ 1.5 × 1010 years. Moreover, one cannot rule out the possibility
that the constants diﬀer in widely separated regions of the Universe; this could be
disproved only by astrophysical observations and diﬀerent kinds of experiments.

Laboratory experiments cannot trace possible variation of a fundamental con-
stant during the entire history of the Universe. Fortunately, Nature has provided
us with a tool for direct measuring the physical constants in the early epochs. This
tool is based on observations of quasars, the most powerful sources of radiation.
Many quasars belong to most distant objects we can observe. Light from the dis-
tant quasars travels to us about 1010 years. This means that the quasar spectra
registered now were formed ∼ 1010 years ago. The wavelengths of the lines ob-
served in these spectra (λobs) increase compared to their laboratory values (λlab)
in proportion λobs = λlab(1 + z), where the cosmological redshift z can be used to
determine the age of the Universe at the line-formation epoch. In some cases, the
redshift is as high as z ∼ 3−5, so that the intrinsically far-ultraviolet lines are reg-
istered in the visible range. The examples are demonstrated in Fig. 1. Analysing
these spectra we may study the epoch when the Universe was several times younger
than now.

Here we review brieﬂy the studies of the space-time variability of the ﬁne-

structure constant α and the proton-to-electron mass ratio µ.

FINE-STRUCTURE CONSTANT

Various tests of the fundamental constant variability diﬀer in space-time regions
of the Universe which they cover. Local tests relate to the values of constants on
the Earth and in the Solar system. In particular, laboratory tests infer the possible
variation of certain combinations of constants “here and now” from comparison of
diﬀerent frequency standards. Geophysical tests impose constraints on combina-
tions of fundamental constants over the past history of the Solar system, although
most of these constraints are very indirect. In contrast, astrophysical tests allows
one to “measure” the values of fundamental constants in distant areas of the early
Universe.

Local tests

Laboratory experiments

There were a number of laboratory experimets aimed at detection of trends of
the fundamental constants with time by comparison of frequency standards which
have diﬀerent dependences on the constants. We mention only two of the published
experiments.

Comparison of H-masers with Cs-clocks during 427 days revealed a relative (H–
Cs) frequency drift with a rate 1.5 × 10−16 per day, while the rates of (H-H) and
(Cs–Cs) drifts (i.e., the drifts between identical standards, used to control their
stability) were less than 1 × 10−16 per day [6]. A similar result was found in
comparison of a Hg+-clock with a H-maser during 140 days [7]: the rate of the
relative frequency drift was less than (2 ± 1) × 10−16 per day.

Such a drift is treated as a consequence of a diﬀerence in the long-term stability

of diﬀerent atomic clocks. In principle, however, it may be caused by variation of α.
That is why it gives an upper limit to the α variation [7]: | ˙α/α| ≤ 3.7 × 10−14 yr−1.

Geophysical tests

The strongest bound on the possible time-variation rate of α was derived in
1976 by Shlyakhter [8], and recently, from a more detailed analysis, by Damour
and Dyson [9], who obtained | ˙α/α| < 0.7 × 10−16 yr−1, The analysis was based
on measurements of isotope ratios in the Oklo site in Gabon, where a unique
natural uranium nuclear ﬁssion reactor had operated 1.8 billion years ago. The
isotope ratios of samarium produced in this reactor by the neutron capture reaction
149Sm+n →150Sm+γ would be completely diﬀerent, if the energy of the nuclear
resonance responsible for this capture were shifted at least by 0.1 eV.

Another strong bound, | ˙α/α| < 5 × 10−15 yr−1, was obtained by Dyson [5] from

an isotopic analysis of natural radioactive decay products in meteorites.

A weak point of these tests is their dependence on the model of the phenomenon,
fairly complex, involving many physical eﬀects. For instance, Damour and Dyson
[9] estimated possible shift of the above-mentioned resonance due to the α variation,
assuming that the Coulomb energy of the excited state of 150Sm∗, responsible for
the resonance, is not less than the Coulomb energy of the ground state of 150Sm.
In absence of experimental data on the nuclear state in question, this assumption
is not justiﬁed, since heavy excited nuclei often have Coulomb energies smaller
than those for their ground states [10]. Furthermore, a correlation between the
constants of strong and electroweak interactions (which is likely in the frame of
modern theory) might lead to further softening of the mentioned bounds by 100-
fold, to | ˙α/α| < 5 × 10−15 yr−1, as noted by Sisterna and Vucetich [11].

In addition, the local tests cannot be extended to distant space regions and to
the early Universe, since the law of possible space-time variation of α is unknown
a priory. It is the extragalactic astronomy that allows us to study these remote
regions of spacetime, in particular the regions which were causally disconnected at
the epoch of formation of the observed absorption spectra.

Astrophysical tests

To ﬁnd out whether α changed over the cosmological time, we have studied the
ﬁne splitting of the doublet lines of Si iv, C iv, Mg ii and other ions, observed in
the spectra of distant quasars. According to quantum electrodynamics, the relative
splitting of these lines δλ/λ is proportional to α2 (neglecting very small corrections).
Consequently, if α changed with time, then δλ/λ would depend on the cosmological
redshift z. This method of measuring α in distant regions of the Universe had been
ﬁrst suggested by Savedoﬀ [12] and was used later by other authors. For instance,
Wolfe et al. [13] derived an estimate | ˙α/α| < 4 × 10−12 yr−1 from an observation of
the Mg ii absorption doublet at z = 0.524.

An approximate formula which relates a deviation of α at redshift z from its cur-
rent value, ∆αz, with measured δλ/λ in the extragalactic spectra and in laboratory
reads

∆αz ≈

cr

2 "(δλ/λ)z

(δλ/λ)0

− 1# ,

(1)

where cr ∼ 1 takes into account radiation corrections [14]: for instance, for Si iv
cr ≈ 0.9.

Many high-quality quasar spectra measured in the last decade have enabled us to
signiﬁcantly increase the accuracy of determination of δλ/λ at large z. An example
of the spectra observed is shown in Fig. 1. For the present report, we have selected
the results of high-resolution observations [15–17], most suitable for an analysis of
α variation. The values of ∆α/α calculated from these data according to Eq. (1)
are given in Table 1.

As a result, we obtain a new estimate of the possible deviation of the ﬁne-

structure constant at z = 2–4 from its present (z = 0) value:

∆α/α = (−4.6 ± 4.3 [stat] ± 1.4 [syst]) × 10−5,

(2)

where the statistical error is obtained from the scatter of astronomical data (at large
z) and the systematic one is estimated from the uncertainty of the ﬁne splitting
measurement in the laboratory [18,19] (at z = 0, which serves as the reference point
for the estimation of ∆α). The corresponding upper limit of the α variation rate
averaged over ∼ 1010 yr is

| ˙α/α| < 1.4 × 10−14 yr−1

(3)

(at the 95% conﬁdence level). This constraint is much more stringent than those
obtained from all but one previous astronomical observations. The notable ex-
ception is presented by Webb et al. [20], who have analysed spectroscopic data of
similar quality, but estimated α from comparison of Fe ii and Mg ii ﬁne-splitted
walelengths in extragalactic spectra and in the laboratory. Their result indicates a
tentative time-variation of α: ∆α/α = (−1.9 ± 0.5) × 10−5 at z = 1.0–1.6. Note,
however, two important sources of a possible systematic error which could mimic
the eﬀect: (a) Fe,ii and Mg ii lines used are situated in diﬀerent orders of the
echelle-spectra, so relative shifts in calibration of the diﬀerent orders can simu-
late the eﬀect of α-variation, and (b) were the relative abundances of Mg isotopes
changing during the cosmological evolution, the Mg ii lines would be subjected to
an additional z-dependent shift relative to the Fe ii lines, quite suﬃcient to sim-
ulate the variation of α (this shift can be easily estimated from recent laboratory
measurements [21]). In contrast, the method based on the ﬁne splitting of a line
of the same ion species (Si iv in the above example) is not aﬀected by these two
uncertainty sources. Thus we believe that the restriction (3) is the most reliable at
present for the long-term history of the Universe.

According to our analysis, some theoretical models are inconsistent with observa-
tions. For example, power laws α ∝ tn with n = 1, −1/4, and −4/3, published by
various authors in 1980s, are excluded. Moreover, the Teller–Dyson’s hypothesis on
the logarithmic dependence of α on t [22,5] has also been shown to be inconsistent
with observations.

Many regions of formation of the spectral lines, observed at large redshifts in
diﬀerent directions in the sky, had been causally disconnected at the epochs of line
formation. Thus, no information could have been exchanged between these regions
of the Universe and, in principle, the fundamental constants could be diﬀerent
there. However, a separate analysis [23] has shown that α value is the same in
diﬀerent directions in the sky within the 3σ relative error |∆α/α| < 3 × 10−4.

PROTON-TO-ELECTRON MASS RATIO

The dimensionless constant µ = mp/me approximately equals the ratio of the
constants of strong interaction g2/(¯hc) ∼ 14 and electromagnetic interaction α ≈
1/137.036, where g is the eﬀective coupling constant calculated from the amplitude
of nucleon–π-meson scattering at low energy.

In order to check the cosmological variability of µ we have used high-redshift
absorption lines of molecular hydrogen H2 in the spectrum of the quasar PKS
0528–250. This is the ﬁrst (and, in a sense, unique) high-redshift system of H2
absorption lines discovered in 1985 [24]. A study of these objects yields information
of paramount importance on the physical conditions ∼ 1010 years ago.

A possibility of distinguishing between the cosmological redshift of spectral wave-
lengths and shifts due to a variation of µ arises from the fact that the electronic,

vibrational, and rotational energies of H2 each undergo a diﬀerent dependence on
the reduced mass of the molecule. Hence comparing ratios of wavelengths λi of
various H2 electron-vibration-rotational lines in a quasar spectrum at some red-
shift z and in laboratory (at z = 0), we can trace variation of µ. The method had
been used previously by Foltz et al. [25], whose analysis was corrected later in our
papers [26,23,27]. In the latter papers, we calculated the sensitivity coeﬃcients Ki
of the wavelengths λi with respect to possible variation of µ and applied a linear
regression analysis to the measured redshifts of individual lines zi as function of
Ki. An illustration of the wavelength dependences on the mass of the nucleus is
given in Table 2, where a few resonance wavelengths of hydrogen, deuterium, and
tritium molecules are listed. One can see that, as the nuclear mass increases, dif-
ferent wavelengths shift in diﬀerent directions. More complete tables, as well as
two algorithms of Ki calculation, are given in Refs. [23,28].

Thus, if the proton mass in the epoch of line formation were diﬀerent from the

present value, the measured zi and Ki values would correlate:

We have performed a z-to-K regression analysis using a modern high-resolution
spectrum of PKS 0528−250 [28]. Several tens of the H2 lines have been identiﬁed;
a portion of the spectrum which reveales some of the lines is shown in Fig. 1. The
redshift estimates for individual absorption lines with their individual errorbars
are plotted in Fig. 2 against their sensitivity coeﬃcients. The resulting parameter
estimate and 1σ uncertainty is

∆µ/µ = (−11.5 ± 7.6 [stat] ± 1.9 [syst]) × 10−5.

The 2σ conﬁdence interval to ∆µ/µ is

|∆µ/µ| < 2.0 × 10−4.

(6)

Assuming that the age of the Universe is ∼ 15 Gyr the redshift of the H2 absorption
system z = 2.81080 corresponds to the elapsed time of 13 Gyr (in the standard
cosmological model). Therefore we arrive at the restriction

| ˙µ/µ| < 1.5 × 10−14 yr−1

(7)

on the variation rate of µ, averaged over 90% of the lifetime of the Universe.

absorption system in the spectrum of the quasar PKS 0528−250, plotted vs. λi(µ)-sensitivity
coeﬃcients Ki. The slanted solid line shows the most probable regression and the dashed ones
corespond to ±1σ deviations of the slope.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite the theoretical prediction of the time-dependences of fundamental con-
stants, a statistically signiﬁcant variation of any of the constants have not been
reliably detected up to date, according to our point of view substantiated above.
The upper limits obtained indicate that the constants of electroweak and strong
interactions did not signiﬁcantly change over the last 90% of the history of the
Universe. This shows that more precise measurements and observations and their
accurate statistical analyses are required in order to detect the expected variations
of the fundamental constants.

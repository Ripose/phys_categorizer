We report Monte Carlo wave function simulation results on cold collisions between magnesium
atoms in a strong red-detuned laser ﬁeld. The Doppler limit heating rate due to radiative collisions
is calculated for 24Mg atoms in a magneto-optical trap based on the 1S0-1P1 atomic laser cooling
transition. We ﬁnd that radiative heating does not seem to aﬀect the Doppler limit in this case.
We also describe a channelling mechanism due to the missing Q branch in the excitation scheme,
which could lead to a suppression of inelastic collisions, and ﬁnd that this mechanism is not present
in our simulation results due to the multistate character of the excitation process.

Introduction. Laser cooling and trapping methods
are an important ingredient in the recent achievements
in the low-temperature physics of gaseous atoms and
molecules [1].
In alkali atoms one can reach very low
temperatures with Sisyphus and polarization gradient
techniques, which surpass the Doppler cooling method in
eﬃciency, and appear in magneto-optical traps without
additional eﬀorts [2]. The drawback is that it becomes
impossible to test the basic two-state Doppler cooling
theory with these systems.

The appearance of sub-Doppler cooling is based on the
hyperﬁne structure of the alkali atoms. The same hy-
perﬁne structure is reﬂected in the complicated molecu-
lar state structure of the quasimolecule formed by two
colliding atoms. In dilute atomic gases binary collisions
dominate the atomic interactions, and the quasimolecule
states couple with the cooling and trapping light ﬁeld.
This leads to inelastic light-assisted collisions that cause
either loss or heating of the trapped atoms [3, 4, 5]. Thus
in alkali atoms the hyperﬁne structure leads to diﬃcul-
ties in testing the Doppler theory, as well as in modelling
the collisional processes.

The major isotopes of alkaline earth atoms, on the
other hand, have no nuclear spin and thus the hyper-
ﬁne structure is missing. This makes the Doppler limit
for temperatures the true laser cooling limit, and allows
for testing the basic Doppler theory. Experimental stud-
ies have been published recently for 88Sr [6], and have
been obtained for 24Mg as well [7]. They indicate an
intensity-dependent heating rate which prevents reach-
ing the theoretical Doppler limit.

Inelastic laser-assisted collisions are expected to de-
pend strongly on intensity even when the atomic tran-
sition is saturated (Is = 0.444 W/cm2 for the 1S0-1P1
laser cooling transition of 24Mg) [4]. In this region the
problem is that most theoretical approaches are applica-
ble only to the weak ﬁeld situation, and can not handle
the energy exchange when the energy change spectrum
is continuous (as is the case for radiative collisional heat-
ing). An important exception is the Monte Carlo wave

function method (MCWF) [8, 9], which we apply here to
the case of 24Mg, to obtain the average energy increase
per collision near the Doppler limit (at 1 mK for 24Mg).
Although simple in theory, the collisions between the al-
kaline earth atoms at strong ﬁelds are complicated since
the partial waves and rotational states of the ground and
excited states (respectively) of the quasimolecule form a
network of two inﬁnite sets of coupled states [10].

In this article we report the results of Monte Carlo
simulations of collisional radiative heating, based on a
truncated set of partial waves and rotational states. We
derive a heating rate due to these collisions, and com-
pare it to the photon scattering heating rate that sets
the Doppler limit in the standard collisionless theory.
We also outline a channelling mechanism which is pos-
sible due to the speciﬁc structure and selection rules of
the alkaline earth dimer quasimolecule, and which could
lead to the suppression of inelastic processes, and test it
with the simulations. Here we concentrate on the results
provided by the simulations, and report the multitude of
technical simulation details elsewhere.

Magnesium quasimolecule. The lasers for cooling and
trapping are normally detuned a few atomic linewidths
(γat) below the atomic transition, which means that the
attractive quasimolecule states have a ﬁnite internuclear
distance, the Condon point RC , where they become res-
onant with the laser ﬁeld. For 24Mg and other alkaline
earth atoms we have two such states, a strongly coupled
u state, and a weakly coupled 1Πg state [11, 12].
1Σ+
In the radiative heating mechanism, the colliding
atoms on a partial wave l are excited at RC to an attrac-
tive quasimolecule state with rotational quantum number
J. The kinetic energy of the relative atomic motion in-
creases as the atoms approach each other further, until
they return to the ground state via spontaneous emission.
The energy exchange due to such a process forms a con-
tinuous distribution below the trap depth energy (above
which the radiative heating becomes radiative escape).

Since the 1Πg state is only weakly coupled to the light
ﬁeld, and provides mainly a channel for trap loss, we

2

can concentrate in our modelling of heating on the 1Σ+
u
state only (see Ref. [10] for a more detailed discussion).
The ground state partial waves and the excited rotational
states are coupled by the selection rules l → J = l ± 1,
i.e., the Q branch for molecular excitation is missing. In
the weak ﬁeld limit one can consider each partial wave
as paired independently to a rotational state, forming a
set of independent two-state systems. At strong ﬁelds
multiple couplings are possible, and one can move back
and forth on the “angular momentum ladder” shown in
Fig. 1. Note that for the bosonic 24Mg atoms the ex-
change symmetry allows only even values for l.

Channelling. One should note, as Fig. 2 illustrates,
that each pair (l, J) is coupled resonantly at a diﬀerent
value of RC . Thus at modest ﬁeld strengths one could
consider a situation where the separation of the Condon
points is valid while the excitation probability is close to
unity. Due to the missing Q branch one can see that
except for the s-wave, we always have a sequence l →
J = l − 1 → l′ = J − 1 = l − 2 so that an incoming
ground state partial wave l is channelled via two crossings
into another ground state partial wave l′′ = l − 2, then
reﬂected by the centrifugal barrier, returning the same
route back to the original state l. This process would
reduce the collisions practically elastic (the s-wave still
remains ”unchannelled”, though).

Collisional heating rate. The energy increase from a
single collision connects to a heating rate and the appro-
priate rate coeﬃcient in the following way. The collisional
heating rate κH (n) describes the kinetic energy change
per unit volume and unit time. For identical particles it
will be equal to 1
2 KHn2, where KH is the rate coeﬃcient
for collisional heating, and n is the atomic density. The
factor of 1/2 removes the doubling in collision counting
for identical particles. The total collisional heating rate
is obtained by integrating κH over the trap volume.

For trap loss rate coeﬃcient Kloss one normally cal-
culates the collision frequency times the probability for
loss, i.e., vσloss, where v is the relative velocity, and σloss
is the cross-section for collisions, including the probabil-
ity for a loss event to occur. This simple classical picture
is connected to thermodynamics by assuming a thermal
equilibrium distribution of velocities, f (v)dv, over which
we take an average, and obtain Kloss = hvσlossi. The dy-
namics of the two-body collision on the microscopic level
then enters in calculating σloss.

To calculate the heating rate coeﬃcient KH is slightly

more complicated, because in addition to the probabil-
ity of an inelastic collision event to happen, we also need
to estimate the amount of kinetic energy increase asso-
ciated with it. Technically, we would have a continuous
distribution of ﬁnal energies corresponding to each ini-
tial value of v, due to the randomness of the spontaneous
emission events. For practical reasons we consider an
averaged rate, i.e., we calculate the average change in
kinetic energy per unit time. Since we can perform the
averaging over ﬁnal energy states before the averaging
over initial states, we deﬁne an inelastic (heating) cross
section σH (v) (units energy×length2) that gives the dif-
ference of the average ﬁnal relative kinetic energy and
initial relative kinetic energy.

In the partial wave approximation we can write the
quantum mechanical cross-section for identical atoms in
a three-dimensional trap as [13]

σ(v) =

π

∞

Xl=0(even)

(2l + 1)Pl(v),

where k is the wave number related to v and Pl(v) is the
event probability. Thus, as a generalization, we write for
heating

σH (v) =

(2l + 1)∆Esc(v, l),

where ∆Esc(v, l) is the average single-collision energy in-
crease related to the initial partial wave l.

In principle one should take the thermal average over
an isotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of relative
velocities v. Due to the complexity of the Monte Carlo
simulations we are, in practice, limited to calculating
∆Esc(v, l) for a rather narrow range of initial relative

is more like adiabatic following of the ﬁeld-dressed (adi-
abatic) quasimolecule states, shown in Fig. 3. However,
this may not be the case for other values of detuning,
or weaker ﬁelds than those used in our simulations. For
this reason we want to emphasise the general possibility
for channelling, and also because it is a good test for the
validity of the reduction into independent two-state mod-
els [10]. We have conﬁned our computationally demand-
ing simulations to large intensities because then there
are suitably many quantum jumps for having reasonable
statistics for small ensembles of 64 or 128 members.

Finally it should be noted that any truncation of the
partial wave/rotational state manifolds must be done so
that the total number of states is even. Otherwise one
would introduce an artiﬁcial dark state as one of the ﬁeld-
dressed eigenstates, into which the strong and fast steady
state formation would trap the system well before the
actual collision begins.

rate coeﬃcient as (E = 1

with QE = (2πµE/h2)3/2, where µ is the reduced two-
particle mass. The simulations have shown this to be a
reasonable approximation.

Simulation results. We have performed a series of
computationally tedious simulations at the detuning δ =
−3γat for various laser intensities, and the main results
are given in Table I. We have used the semiclassical tra-
jectory argument (turning point should be at R < RC for
any involved partial wave) to truncate the sum in Eq. (3).
Clearly a strong increase in the energy change with in-
tensity continues above the saturation intensity Is. The
semiclassical Landau-Zener theory also indicates that in
this intensity region excitation probabilities should be
equal to unity. Thus the continued increase can be at-
tributed to the re-excitation of the decayed population,
as suggested in Ref. [4]; the delayed decay model predicts
(roughly) ∆Esc ∝

I/Is.

TABLE I: Results from the multistate single-collision simula-
tions. The total number of states has been 12, and the initial
state has been l = 8. The energy increase ∆Esc is calculated
as a time average of the kinetic energy in the region where it
is ﬂat, subtracted by the initial energy. The error refers to
the statistical error of the average kinetic energy at the end
of the Monte Carlo simulation.

Additional simulations showed that pre- and post-
collision steady state formation is fast and strong for
I & 5Is, and makes the energy exchange independent
of the initial partial wave, i.e., ∆Esc(v, l) → ∆Esc(v) in
Eq. (3). In other words, in a system where the energy
states are strongly coupled and remain so even asymptot-
ically, the deﬁnition of an initial state is obscured, and we
can actually make meaningful studies because the spon-
taneous emission always leads to the same steady state,
independent of initial l, well before RC is reached. For
I . 5Is there is some initial state dependence, but on a
scale that allows one to use the values given in Table I
as a reasonable estimate of magnitude.

As for the channelling eﬀect, there was no sign of it
in the simulations. The explanation is rather clear. The
Condon points are close to each other both in position
and energy, and the true picture of the excitation process

Comparison of rates. The heating rate prediction of
the simulations must be compared to the photon scatter-
ing heating rate that enters the calculation of the Doppler

The above expression has been derived for a one-

full six-beam three-dimensional situation is an interest-
ing and open question, and one of the strong motivations
to study Doppler cooling with alkaline earth atoms.

For n ≃ 1011 atoms/cm3 and I ≃ Is this gives about 0.1
K/s. This result implies that radiative collisional heat-
ing can not explain the problems in reaching the Doppler
limit for 24Mg, because the densities are usually in the
range of 109 to 1011 atoms/cm3. We have earlier per-
formed two-state studies for Cs and found that there the
heating rate present in Sisyphus cooling should match
the collisional heating rate at n = 1012 atoms/cm3 [8].

As for making a comparison to the 88Sr case, without
performing simulations, we can make a rough estimate.
In Eq. (3) we have written KH (E) in a scaled form, so
we can put in the corresponding values for 88Sr as well
(E/kB ≃ TD = 0.77 mK, λ = 460.73 nm, Er = 1 µK,
and taking again |δ| = 3γat). The remaining problem
is to estimate ∆Esc. In a toy model that assumes total
excitation during a collision, and ignores re-excitation,
we can write ∆Esc ≃ U ′(RC )τ v, where U ′(RC ) is the
slope of the excited state (ignoring J) potential at RC ,
and τ ≃ 1/γat is the average survival time on the excited
molecular state, and v is the initial collision velocity. This
leads to an estimate of ∆Esc/Er = 23(E/Er)1/2, which
at least for 24Mg gives 230, i.e., the correct magnitude
near I = Is. With all this, we get for 88Sr at the Doppler

4

temperature the result KH (E) ≃ 2×10−12 Kcm3/s, to be
compared with Erγat/80 ≃ 2.5 K/s. These results meet
only at densities of n ≃ 1012 atoms/cm3, which are a few
magnitudes higher than those used in the experiment of
Ref. [6]. This toy model also predicts a detuning depen-
dence of KH (E) of ∝ |δ|2/3, i.e., heating decreases with
detuning, which means that while the number of involved
partial waves increases with diminishing |δ|, the eﬀect is
more than countered by the reduction in the steepness of
the excited state potential.

Conclusions. This study is the ﬁrst attempt to describe
quantitatively the radiative collisional heating by taking
into account the inherent multistate structure due to the
partial waves and rotational states. As will be described
elsewhere, the truncation of the partial wave manifold has
required careful testing of various possibilities. Although
it appears that collisional radiative heating does not play
a role in the thermodynamics of the trap at realistic den-
sities for 24Mg (and other alkaline earth atoms), our work
does not rule it out completely. Although assumed to be
irrelevant here, the weakly coupled 1Πg state may play a
role, as well as the two quasimolecule states correspond-
ing to the repulsive potentials. Experimentally the role
of collisional processes can be distinguished from other
processes by looking at the scaling with density; this has
already been used to separate the cold collision contribu-
tions from the background collisions in trap loss. While
we aim to improve our modelling and to use our heating
results in estimating radiative trap loss, we also expect
that more experimental data will become accessible in
the near future.

We report the direct frequency measurement of the visi-
ble 5s2 1S0-5s 5p3P1 intercombination line of strontium that is
considered a possible candidate for a future optical frequency
standard. The frequency of a cavity-stabilized laser is locked
to the saturated ﬂuorescence in a thermal Sr atomic beam and
is measured with an optical-frequency comb-generator refer-
enced to the SI second through a GPS signal. The 88Sr tran-
sition is measured to be at 434 829 121 311 (10) kHz. We mea-
sure also the 88Sr-86Sr isotope shift to be 163 817.4 (0.2) kHz.

The recent development of optical-frequency comb gen-
eration has made possible, for the ﬁrst time, relatively
easy optical frequency measurements [1,2]. This, in turn,
opened the way to atomic clocks based on optical fre-
quency transitions. Because of their higher frequency,
these transitions have potential for greatly improved
accuracy and stability relative to conventional atomic
clocks based on microwave frequency transitions [3]. Dif-
ferent transitions are now considered as optical frequency
standards, involving single ions and neutral atoms [4].
While single ions oﬀer an excellent control on systematic
eﬀects, clouds of laser cooled atoms have the potential for
extremely high precision. Amongst the neutral atoms, Sr
has long been considered one of the most interesting can-
didates [5]. Several features, some of which are speciﬁc to
this atom, allow diﬀerent possibilities for the realization
of a high precision optical clock. The intercombination
51S-53P lines from the ground state are in the visible and
easily accessible with semiconductor lasers (Fig.1). De-
pending on the speciﬁc ﬁne-structure component and on
the isotope - Sr has four natural isotopes, three bosonic,
88Sr (82%), 86Sr (10%), 84Sr (0.5%) with nuclear spin
I=0 and one fermionic, 87Sr (7%) with I=9/2 - a wide
choice of transitions with diﬀerent natural linewidths is
possible. These span from the 7.5 kHz linewidth of the
51S0-53P1 line, which is the subject of the present paper,
down to the highly forbidden 51S0-53P0,2 transitions. In
87Sr, the presence of hyperﬁne mixing has allowed the ob-
servation of the 0-0 transition which is expected to have
a natural width of only 1 mHz [6].

From the point of view of laser cooling and manipula-
tion, Sr has several interesting features which are also im-
portant for the ﬁnal operation of a precise frequency stan-

dard: two-stage cooling using the intercombination tran-
sition allows extremely low temperatures and magneto-
optical trapping; atoms can be trapped in optical lat-
tices with negligible shift of the optical clock transition;
all-optical cooling down to quantum degeneracy should
be possible for bosonic and fermionic isotopes [7–9]. Af-
ter initial laser spectroscopy experiments based on wave-
length metrology and discharges as atomic sources [10],
recently Sr has been the subject of several experiments
aiming to all-optical Bose-Einstein condensation [7], con-
tinuous atom laser [11] and detection of ultra-narrow
transitions [6,12]. From the theoretical point of view,
this atom is also considered interesting for the under-
standing of its spectrum [13,14] and for the investigation
of cold collisions [15,16].

In this paper, we report the ﬁrst precision frequency
measurements on the intercombination 51S0-53P1 transi-
tion. Using a femtosecond laser comb, we determine the
absolute frequency of the transition for 88Sr and 86Sr and
a very accurate value for the isotope shift. The improve-
ment by several orders with respect to previous data, ob-
tained with a relatively simple and compact apparatus,
demonstrate the potentialities of this system.

The experimental setup we use is composed of a laser-

are locked to keep the laser on resonance with the atomic

tioning System (GPS) controlled quartz. A scheme of the
experimental setup is given in Fig. 2. The extended cav-
ity laser-diode (ECDL) is a Hitachi HL6738MG mounted
in the Littrow conﬁguration which delivers typically
15 mW. Optical feedback to the ECDL is prevented by a
40 dB optical isolator and a single pass acusto-optic mod-
ulator in cascade. The laser linewidth is reduced by lock-
ing the laser to an optical reference cavity (RC) with the
classic Pound-Drever-Hall scheme [17]; the phase modu-
lation is produced by a resonant electro-optic modulator
(EOM) driven at 21 MHz. To avoid residual standing
wave in the EOM, which induces spurious AM on the
locking signal, a 25 dB optical isolator is placed between
the EOM and the cavity. The reference cavity has a free
spectral range (FSR) of 1.5 GHz and a ﬁnesse of 10000.
On one side of the quartz spacer we glued a concave
mirror (R=50 cm) while on the other side a piezoelec-
tric transducer (PZT) is glued between the spacer and a
ﬂat mirror in order to steer the modes of the cavity by
more than one FSR.

(OI) and acusto-optic modulators (AOM) eliminate feedback
among the master laser (ECDL), the slave laser, the elec-

taining ﬁber.

The lock of the laser onto the cavity includes a low
frequency loop acting on the PZT of the ECDL (1 kHz
bandwidth), and a high frequency loop acting on the
laser-diode current supply (1 MHz bandwidth). Under
lock condition more than 55 % of the incident light is
transmitted through the cavity. From the noise spectra of
the locking signal and by comparison with another cavity
we can infer a laser linewidth less than 2 kHz, and more
than 90 % of the optical power in the carrier [18]. We do
not passively stabilize the RC in a vacuum chamber [19]
since the acoustic and sub acoustic noise is removed by
the servo to the atomic signal which acts on the PZT of
the RC with a 200 Hz bandwidth.

The strontium atomic beam is obtained from the metal
heated to 830 K in an oven and using a bundle of stainless
steel capillaries to collimate it [20]. The residual atomic

beam divergency is 25 mrad and the typical atomic den-
sity in the detection region is 108 cm−3.

The Doppler-free atomic line is resolved by saturation
spectroscopy using two counterpropagating laser beams
perpendicular to the atomic beam. The ﬂuorescence light
from the laser excited atoms is collected on a photomul-
tiplier tube with an eﬃciency of 0.4 % including quantum
eﬃciency and solid angle. Orthogonality between atomic
and laser beams is optimized by centering the Lamb dip
with respect to the Doppler proﬁle (Fig. 3).

The laser beam is ﬁltered using a single mode ﬁber
and collimated at a 1/e2 diameter of 14 mm (wavefront
distortion less than λ/6); the beam is retro-reﬂected us-
ing a mirror at a distance of 65 mm from the interac-
tion region and coupled back into the ﬁber. We estimate
the indetermination on the angle of the retroreﬂected
beam to be less than 10 µrad maximizing the transmit-
ted power through the ﬁber. The peak beam intensity of
60 µWcm−2 (to be compared to the saturation intensity
of 3 µWcm−2) was chosen to obtain suﬃcient signal to
noise for the RC lock onto the atomic resonance. A uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld of 10 Gauss deﬁnes the quantization
axis in the interrogation region such that the light is π
polarized.

line at 689 nm. The lines of the two bosonic isotopes 86Sr and
88Sr, together with the hyperﬁne structure of the fermionic
87Sr, can be resolved. The linewidth corresponds to the resid-
ual 1st order Doppler broadening in the thermal beam. Inset:

troscopy using two counter-propagating laser beams. The
amplitude of the dip is 10 % of the Doppler signal.

The acusto-optic modulators between the ECDL and
the EOM (AOM1) and between the ECDL and the slave
laser (AOM2) are driven from the same oscillator and
both deliver the -1 order such that the frequency insta-
bility and indetermination of their driving RF does not
aﬀect the optical frequency measurement. The double
pass AOM next to the atomic detection (AOM3) is fre-
quency modulated at 10 kHz to derive the locking signal
of the cavity onto the atomic line, and its RF is counted

quency comb. Fig. 3 shows the Doppler broadened reso-
nances of 88Sr, 86Sr and the hyperﬁne structure of 87Sr.
The residual atomic beam divergency produces a residual
Doppler broadening of 60 MHz FWHM. In the inset, the
sub-Doppler signal for 88Sr is shown. Two independent
measurements [21] of the sub-Doppler resonance show
a FWHM of about 50 kHz, which is in agreement with
the expected value considering the saturation and tran-
sit time broadening, and the recoil splitting.

We measure the optical frequency through a commer-
cial optical frequency comb generator [22] based on a
Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:Sa laser with a repetition rate
of 1GHz, which is spectrally broadened in a microstruc-
tured ﬁber. Stability and accuracy of the comb generator
are established by referencing the repetition and carrier
oﬀset envelope frequencies to a GPS stabilized oscillator.
Figure 4 shows the result of the measurement of the 88Sr
transition frequency taken over a period of several days.
Each data point corresponds to the averaging of the val-
ues resulting from consecutive measurements taken with
a 1 s integration time over 100-200 s. The error bars cor-
respond to the standard deviation for each data set. The
Allan deviation of each set shows a ﬂicker ﬂoor varying
between 1 and 2 kHz in the region from 1 to 100 seconds.

quency. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation
for each data set.

Analysis of potential systematic errors (see table I)
indicate that we should have no uncontrolled bias of
more than 5 kHz. We have evaluated 1st and 2nd order
Doppler and Zeeman eﬀects, AC Stark shift, collisional
shifts, and mechanical eﬀects of light. 1st order Doppler
shift, resulting from imperfect alignment in our stand-
ing wave, is evaluated at 7 kHz by comparing consecu-
tive measurements with independent alignments. The
1st order Doppler shift was randomized by realigning the
retroreﬂected beam after each measurement and the re-
sulting contribution in the ﬁnal uncertainty is included

3

as 2 kHz. Frequency noise induced by atmospheric tur-
bulence modulating the beam pointing is measured to be
less than 1 kHz/√Hz. The oﬀsets and lineshape asymme-
tries introduced by the recoil, atom deﬂection induced by
the light ﬁeld, and2nd order Doppler are calculated by
numerically integrating the 1D optical Bloch equations
along the atomic trajectories considering the experimen-
tal conditions [23]. The resonance linewidth obtained
from this simulation is in good agreement with the exper-
imental value proving that we do not have unexplained
line broadening mechanisms. Since we observe a closed
transition we estimate the oﬀset introduced by unbal-
anced counter-propagating beams and curved wavefront
[24], and wavefront distortion less than 2 kHz . There is
no ﬁrst order Zeeman shift because we observe the J = 0
to J = 1, ∆m = 0 transition. Because the excited state
ﬁne structure splitting is of the order of few THz, the
second-order Zeeman shift in our magnetic ﬁeld is of the
order of few Hz and totally insigniﬁcant to this measure-
ment. The collisional shift coeﬃcient for this transition
has not been measured but the self broadening coeﬃcient
is known to be about 50 MHz/torr [25] and the shift is
generally considerably smaller. Hence, assuming as an
upper limit for the collisional shift the self broadening
coeﬀcient and considering the background pressure of the
order of 10−6 torr, we expect a pressure induced shift of
less than 50 Hz. The spectral purity of the interrogat-
ing laser is an important subject. Unbalanced sidebands
within the range of atomic linewidth will lead to a fre-
quency pulling eﬀect. Such unbalanced sidebands must
be accompanied by a synchronous AM component; pure
FM and pure phase modulation sidebands will not lead
to a pulling. Hence, a simple power detector and FFT
suﬃce to place an upper bound on their presence.
In
our case, all such sidebands are more than 40 dB below
the carrier and lead to a pulling that is less than 1%
of the atomic linewidth. We did not experimentally ob-
serve any dependence of the measured optical frequency
on the modulation depth and laser intensity, which is
in agreement with numerical simulations. The resulting
value for the 88Sr transition frequency, including the cor-
rections discussed previously, is 434 829 121 311 (10) kHz,
10−11.
corresponding to a 1 σ relative uncertainty of 2.3
With a minor change in the apparatus, we locked si-
multaneously the frequency of two laser beams to the
sub-Doppler signals of 86Sr and 88Sr. This system al-
lowed us to measure the isotope shift by counting the
beatnote between the two interrogating beams. For this
purpose, the reference cavity is locked to 88Sr resonance
as described previously and the light for 86Sr is derived
from the same laser beam and brought to resonance
through AOM’s. The two beams are overlapped in a
single mode optical ﬁber and sent to the interrogation
region. By frequency modulating the beams at diﬀerent
rates and using phase sensitive detection we get the lock
signal for both the isotopes from the same photomulti-

plier. The lock on 86Sr acts on the voltage-controlled
oscillator that drives one of its AOMs. The 86Sr lock
bandwidth of 1 Hz, limited by lower signal to noise, is
enough since the short term stability is insured by the
lock to the reference cavity and 88Sr.

In this isotope shift measurement most of the noise
sources are basically common mode and rejected, the Al-
lan variance shows a white noise spectrum of 1 kHz at 2 s
and does not show any ﬂicker noise for times longer than
500 s, resulting in precision better than 100 Hz. At this
level of precision we observe the servo loop oﬀset compen-
sation limiting the reproducibility to 200 Hz. The mea-
sured 88Sr-86Sr isotope shift for the 1S0-3P1 transition
is 163 817.4 (0.2) kHz. This value represents an improve-
ment in accuracy of more than 3 orders of magnitude with
respect to previously available data [26]. The 86Sr opti-
cal frequency then amounts to 434 828 957 494 (10) kHz.
We did not measure the hyperﬁne structure and isotope
shift of the 87Sr since an accurate measurement requires
a low magnetic ﬁeld environment not compatible with
our spectroscopic scheme.

×

The isotope-shift experiment provides also an indica-
tion of the laser frequency stability when locked to the
atomic signal for periods longer than 2 s [19]. We con-
10−12 in the
clude that the observed ﬂicker noise at 5
absolute frequency measurement may be attributed to
the optical frequency comb including its frequency refer-
10−11
ence. Moreover the relative uncertainty of 1.2
due to uncontrolled systematic eﬀects does not explain
10−11 in the absolute
completely the data scatter of 5
frequency measurement. We did not evaluate the noise
performance in the GPS disciplined quartz oscillator that
is our local frequency reference. Possible sources of noise
are oscillation frequency sensitivity of quartz to vibration
and the behaviour of the complex, adaptive ﬁlter used to
discipline the quartz local oscillator to the GPS signal
[27] in the 103-104 s region, which is the time period in
which we are making our measurements.

In conclusion, we demonstrated locking of a laser-diode
to the visible 5s2 1S0-5s 5p3P1 intercombination line of Sr
and measured its frequency using an optical-frequency
comb-generator referenced to the SI second through a
GPS signal. The optical frequency measurement is ob-
10−11, which
tained with a relative uncertainty of 2.3
represents an improvement of more than 4 orders of mag-
nitude with respect to previous data [10]. We also obtain
an accurate value for the 88Sr-86Sr isotope shift improv-
ing the accuracy by more than 3 orders of magnitude.

Future improvements and developments involve cool-
ing and trapping of Sr atoms. Using cold atoms a pre-
cision in the range of one part in 1014 in one second
can be expected with the transition investigated in this
2 transi-
work. Probing the ultranarrow 0
tions in cold trapped atoms should lead to a dramatic
improvement in stability and accuracy opening the way

could employ all-solid-state laser sources (including light
at 461 nm required for cooling and trapping). the real-
ization of ultra-precise optical frequency standards based
on compact and eventually transportable systems will en-
able future tests of fundamental physics on Earth and in
space.

On the secondly quantized theory of many-electron
atom

Abstract

Traditional theory of many-electron atoms and ions is based on the
coeﬃcients of fractional parentage and matrix elements of tensorial
operators, composed of unit tensors. Then the calculation of spin-
angular coeﬃcients of radial integrals appearing in the expressions of
matrix elements of arbitrary physical operators of atomic quantities
has two main disadvantages: (i) The numerical codes for the calcula-
tion of spin-angular coeﬃcients are usually very time-consuming; (ii)
f-shells are often omitted from programs for matrix element calculation
since the tables for their coeﬃcients of fractional parentage are very
extensive.

The authors suppose that a series of diﬃculties persisting in the
traditional approach to the calculation of spin-angular parts of matrix
elements could be avoided by using this secondly quantized methodol-
ogy, based on angular momentum theory, on the concept of the irre-
ducible tensorial sets, on a generalized graphical method, on quasispin
and on the reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage.

Introduction

Modern atomic spectroscopy studies the structure and properties of prac-
tically any atom of the periodic table as well as of ions of any ionization
degree. Particular attention is paid to their energy spectra. For the in-
vestigations of many-electron atoms and ions, it is of great importance to
combine experimental and theoretical methods. Nowadays the possibilities
of theoretical spectroscopy are much enlarged thanks to the wide usage of
powerful computers. Theoretical methods utilized must be fairly universal
and must ensure reasonably accurate values of physical quantities studied.
Many-electron atom usually is considered as many-body problem and is
described by the wave function constructed from the wave functions of one
electron, moving in the central nuclear charge ﬁeld and in the screening ﬁeld
of the remaining electrons. Then the wave function of this electron may
be represented as a product of radial and spin-angular parts. The radial
part is usually found by solving various modiﬁcations of the Hartree-Fock
equations and can be represented in a numerical or analytical forms (Froese
Fischer 1977) whereas the angular part is expressed in terms of spherical
functions. Then the wave function of the whole atom can be constructed in
some standard way (Cowan 1981, Jucys and Savukynas 1973, Nikitin and
Rudzikas 1983) starting with these one-electron functions and may be used
further on for the calculations of any matrix elements representing physical
quantities.

During the last two decades a number of new versions of the technique
(so-called Racah algebra) to cope with spin-angular parts of the wave func-
tions and matrix elements have been suggested (Rudzikas 1991). Among
them the second quantization and quasispin techniques turned out to be
of particular eﬃciency (Judd 1967, Rudzikas and Kaniauskas 1984). The
usage of graphical methods (Jucys and Bandzaitis 1977) allowed one to ﬁnd
general expressions even for rather complex cases of matrix elements. All
this enabled one to formulate fairly consistent and general non-relativistic
and relativistic theory of many-electron atom and processes of its interac-
tion with electromagnetic radiation (Rudzikas 1996). The abovementioned
methods are applicable for the both variational and perturbative approaches
for various coupling schemes of spin and orbital momenta.

Practically we have to solve so-called eigenvalue problem

HΨ = EΨ,

(1)

2

where Ψ is the wave function of the system under investigation and H is
its Hamiltonian. In various versions of perturbation theory such equation
usually serves as the starting point for the further reﬁnements. It turned
out that for very large variety of atoms and their ionization degrees the
so-called Hartree-Fock-Pauli Hamiltonian leads to highly accurate energy
values (Nikitin and Rudzikas 1983, Rudzikas 1996) that is why it is widely
used in many methods and computer codes.

In order to calculate the energy spectrum of atom or ion we have to ﬁnd
the expressions for the matrix elements of all terms of the Hamiltonian con-
sidered. For complex electronic conﬁgurations, having several open shells,
this is a task very far from the trivial one. For the optimization of their ex-
pressions one has to combine the methods of the angular momentum theory,
irreducible tensorial sets, tensorial products in a coupled form, coeﬃcients
of fractional parentage with the utilization of the graphical (diagrammatic)
methods, second quantization and with the accounting for the symmetry
properties of the system under consideration in the additional spaces, for
example, quasispin space. This paper describes one such possibility.

Unfortunately, practical calculations show that all realistic atomic Hamil-
tonians do not lead straightforwardly to eigenvalue problem (1). Actually we
have to calculate all non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian considered
including those non-diagonal with respect to electronic conﬁgurations, then
to form energy matrix, to diagonalize it, obtaining in this way the values
of the energy levels as well as the eigenfunctions (the wave functions in the
intermediate coupling scheme). The latter may be used then to calculate
electronic transitions as well as the other properties and processes. Such
necessity raises special requirements to the theory.

The total matrix element of each term of the energy operator in the
case of complex electronic conﬁguration will consist of matrix elements, de-
scribing the interaction inside each shell (in relativistic case - each subshell)
of equivalent electrons as well as between these shells. Going beyond the
single-conﬁguration approximation we have to be able to take into account in
the same way non-diagonal, with respect to conﬁgurations, matrix elements.
Starting at the very beginning with the second quantization and quasispin
methods we are in a position to fulﬁll all these requirements. Below we shall
describe the approach suggested in the more details.

2 Tensorial Form of the Operators

According to the method of second quantization (Judd 1967, Rudzikas and
Kaniauskas 1984) any one-particle operator

F =

aia+

j (i|f |j) ,

Xi,j

can be expressed in the following tensorial form:

F =

F (i, j) =

Xnili,njlj

Xnili,njlj

[κ, σ]

niλi||f (κσ)||njλj
(cid:16)

(cid:17) (cid:20)

a(λi)×

(λj )

∼
a

where i ≡ nilismlimsi, λ ≡ ls, [κ, σ] ≡ (2κ + 1) (2σ + 1) ,
is the one-electron submatrix (reduced matrix) element of operator F , and
(cid:17)
a(λi) is the electron creation operator. The tensor

niλi||f (κσ)||njλj
(cid:16)

is deﬁned as

(λj )

∼
a

∼
a

(λ)

mλ= (−1)λ−mλ a(λ)+
−mλ,

where a(λ)+

−mλ is the electron annihilation operator. From tensorial point of
as electron annihilation operator

view it is better to consider tensor

a

a(λi)×

(λj )

(cid:20)

(κσ)Γ

(cid:21)

(see Section 4). The product of tensors

denotes tensorial

part of operator F . Here the rank κ of orbital space is coupled to the spin
space rank σ to form a tensorial product of total spin-angular rank Γ. As we
shall see, this expression is very eﬀective for the calculation of spin-angular
coeﬃcients for any one-particle operator. This expression is a general one
and the tensorial form of any one-particle physical operator may be obtained
from it. For example, the spin-orbit interaction operator has the tensorial
structure κ = 1, σ = 1, Γ = 0, and its submatrix element is

In these forms the product of second quantization operators denotes ten-
sorial part of operator G. For instance, the tensorial structure of electrostatic
(Coulomb) electron interaction operator is the same as that of orbit-orbit
interaction, κ1 = κ2 = k, σ1 = σ2 = 0 (Jucys and Savukynas 1984), and only

The tensorial expressions for orbit-orbit and other physical operators in

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

second quantization form may be obtained in the same manner.

It is worth mentioning that the expressions (10) and (11) embrace, al-
ready in an operator form, the interaction terms both the diagonal ones,
relative to conﬁgurations, and the non-diagonal ones. Non-diagonal terms
deﬁne the interaction between all the possible electron distributions over the
conﬁgurations considered, diﬀering by quantum numbers not more than two
electrons.

The merits of representing operators in one form or another (10) or (11)
are mostly determined by the technique used to ﬁnd their matrix elements
and quantities in terms of which they are expressed.

3 Generalized Graphical Method

In this paragraph we shall sketch the generalized version of graphical tech-
nique, in which not only one- and two-particle operators are presented in
tensorial form (such graphs are analogical to Feynman-Goldstone diagrams
but they do not depend on magnetic quantum numbers (Merkelis et al 1986a,
b), but which allows also to represent graphically any tensorial product of
the second quantization operators and to perform graphically the opera-
tions with the secondly quantized operators as well as with their tensorial
products (Gaigalas et al 1985, Gaigalas 1985, Gaigalas and Merkelis 1987).
Such graphical technique is most suitable to represent any one- and two-
particle operator already presented in tensorial form and to found general
expressions for their matrix elements.

In this methodology the item under summation sign of the one-particle

operator (3) has the following graphical form:

F (i, j) = A1 = [κ, σ]

−1/2

niλi||f (κσ)||njλj

A2A3,

(12)

(cid:16)
where the diagrams A1, A2 and A3 are presented on Figure 1. As we see, the
diagram of the operator itself, namely A1, is similar to the usual Feynman-
Goldstone diagram (Lindgren and Morrison 1982), although here the sum-
mation over magnetic quantum numbers mλ is performed. The product of
the diagrams A2, A3 represents the tensorial structure of the operator:

The heavy line in the diagram A3 represents the resultant momentum
Γ whereas the plus sign of the vertex means that the momenta κ and σ
are coupled into the resultant Γ in counter-clockwise direction. From the
symmetry properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients the equality follows:

A3 = (−1)κ+σ−Γ A4.

Then we can conclude that, if we change the sign of any vertex, then the

phase multiplier of the form (−1)κ+σ−Γ occurs.

The electron creation operator a(λi) has the following graphical form

(Figure 1, A5):

as well as of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients

tion operators a(λi) and

which couple these operators into tensorial product and which may be ob-
tained from the diagram A2 if to omit in them the graphical symbols of
the second quantization operators.
It is necessary to bear in mind that,
while writing down the algebraic expression from the diagram A2, always in
tensorial product there must be in the ﬁrst place the second quantization
operator, which is above the vertex ”a”, whereas the second place must oc-
cupy the operator, which is below the vertex ”a” in the diagram A2. The
scheme of their coupling into tensorial product is deﬁned by the sign of the
vertex.

We emphasize here that the winding line of interaction in the Feynman-
Goldstone diagram corresponds to the operators of second quantization in
the normal order (Figure 2, B1). Whereas the dotted interaction line indi-
cates that the second quantization operators are ordered in pairs of creation-
annihilation.
In the latter case ﬁrst comes the pair on the left side of a
Feynman-Goldstone diagram (Figure 2, B2). Such a notation of two kinds
for an interaction line is meaningful only for two-particle (or more) opera-
tors, since for any one particle operator both the winding and dotted lines
correspond to the same order of creation and annihilation operators.

From expressions (20), (21) we see that the two-particle operator in the
ﬁrst form is represented by one Feynman-Goldstone diagram B1, whereas in
the second - by two diagrams B2 and B4. The diagrams, corresponding to
tensorial product, have the following algebraic expressions:

Thus, the obtaining of algebraic expressions from the diagrams B3, B5
and B6 is similar to the case of the diagram A2. The positions of the
second quantization operators in the diagram deﬁne their order in tensorial
product: the ﬁrst place in tensorial product occupies the upper right second
quantization operator, the second - lower right, after them the upper left
and lower left operators follow. The angular momenta diagram deﬁnes their
coupling scheme into tensorial product.

Thus, obeying these rules it is possible to easily ﬁnd the algebraic coun-
terparts of the diagrams, not forgetting that the arrangement of the oper-
ators must not contradict to their coupling order, i.e. only neighbouring
second quantization operators are coupled into tensorial product and their
disposition order corresponds to coupling scheme. Otherwise some graphical
operations are necessary. Let us present the simplest of them below as the
example for the case, when we have to change the disposition of the second
quantization operators and coupling scheme in the tensorial product.

Suppose, we have the following correspondence between diagrams (Fig-

ure 3):

C1 −→ C2,

(25)

in which the second quantization operators are in the order a(λ3) ˜a(λ4) a(λ1)
˜a(λ2). Our goal is to obtain the diagram corresponding to the order a(λ1)
˜a(λ2) a(λ3) ˜a(λ4). Bearing in mind that the second quantization operators
anticommute with each other and they all act on diﬀerent electronic shells
and we are not changing the order of their coupling into tensorial product,
we arrive at

C1 −→ (−1)4C3 = C3.

(26)

Let us also discuss another situation: we have deﬁned the disposition
of the operators and we want to couple them into certain tensorial prod-
uct. Suppose that we want to represent graphically the following tensorial
product:

a(λ1) × ˜a(λ2)

For this purpose we have to rearrange the generalized Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcient, which is deﬁning the scheme of coupling of the operators into the
tensorial product. It is easy to notice that this coeﬃcient will properly deﬁne
the tensorial product, if we change the sign of the vertex ”a” in diagram C3.
Making use of (16) we ﬁnd:

C1 −→ (−1)κ1+κ2−κ+σ1+σ2−σC4.

(28)

The procedures described are fairly simple, however, they are suﬃcient
for the majority of cases. The more complete description of this generalized
graphical approach may be found in Gaigalas et al 1985, Gaigalas 1985,
Gaigalas and Merkelis 1987.

In the quasispin representation, for a wave function of the shell of equiv-
alent electrons |nlN αLS) a label Q - quasispin momentum of the shell - is
introduced, which is related to the seniority quantum number ν, namely,
Q = (2l + 1 − ν) /2, and its projection, MQ = (N − 2l − 1) /2. Here α
denotes all additional quantum numbers needed for the one-to-one classiﬁ-
cation of the energy levels. Then, we can rewrite the wave function (29)

So, by applying the quasispin method for calculating the matrix elements
of any operator, we can use the reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage
or the tensors (for example W (ǫk1k2) (nl, nl)), which are independent of the
occupation number of the shell for a given ν. The main advantage of this
approach is that the standard data tables in such a case will be much smaller
in comparison with tables of the usual coeﬃcients and, therefore, many
summations will be less time-consuming. Also one can see that in such an
approach the submatrix elements of standard tensors and subcoeﬃcients
of fractional parentage actually can be treated in a uniform way as they
all are the completely reduced matrix elements of the second quantization
operators. Hence, all methodology of calculation of matrix elements will be
much more universal in comparison with the traditional one.

5 Matrix Elements in the Case of Two Open Shells

of Equivalent Electrons

The aim of this section is to illustrate the usage of abovementioned method-
ology to obtain the expressions for matrix elements of a two-particle opera-
tor, when the wave function (30) has two open shells n1lN1
2 . Then it
may be written as

1 n2lN2

ψ2 (LSMLMS) ≡ |n1l1n2l2α1L1S1Q1MQ1α2L2S2Q2MQ2LSMLMS). (35)

To ﬁnd numerical value of physical quantity of two-electron operator
one ought to have the expressions for its matrix elements within each shell

16

of equivalent electrons and between each pair of the shells, including non-
diagonal, with respect to conﬁgurations, matrix elements.

While calculating the diagonal matrix elements between functions (35),

iλ′

i = njλj = n′

i = njλj = n′

1. niλi = n′

2. niλi = n′

jλ′

j = n2l2s. (All the operators of second

quantization act upon the second shell).
jλ′
j = n2l2s.
iλ′
i = n2l2s.
i = njλj = n2l2s.
j = n2l2s.

i = n1l1s, njλj = n′
iλ′
3. niλi = n′
j = n1l1s, niλi = n′
jλ′
4. njλj = n′
j = n1l1s, n′

5. niλi = n′
jλ′
i = njλj = n1l1s, niλi = n′

In the ﬁrst case the matrix elements of operator in the ﬁrst (using (7))

and the second (using (8)) forms are equal respectively

j = n1l1s. (All the operators of second

Only these shapes (50), (51), (52), (53), in the case of two open shells,
guarantee the eﬀective use of Racah algebra. That includes the determina-
tion of zero matrix elements from triangular conditions (for example in (52)

δ (L1, L′

calculation, the use of tables of standard quantities, and the use of quasispin

From this we conclude that in the third and fourth cases the usage of the
tensorial expressions of only two-particle operator (8) allows us to success-
fully exploit all the advantages of Racah algebra and quasispin formalism in

calculating the spin-angular parts of any two-particle operator matrix ele-
ment. This, to our mind, not only simpliﬁes the calculations considerably,
by allowing to use the tables of irreducible tensors that are independent of
shell occupation numbers, but also allows one to establish the zero matrix
elements without performing explicit calculation.

Meanwhile the situation is diﬀerent when the last two cases are consid-
ered, or the matrix elements between more complex conﬁgurations are to
be established. This is related to the fact that using ﬁrst (7) or second (8)
tensorial forms the spin-angular part of matrix elements for those cases do
not have shape of any expression (50), (51), (52) and (53).

In the next paper we shall present a methodology that allows one to use
eﬃciently the Racah algebra and quasispin formalism in a general case, too.

6 Conclusion

Preliminary usage of the generalized graphical method, irreducible tensorial
form of the second quantization operators as well as of quasispin technique,
while calculating the spin-angular parts of matrix elements of the energy
operator, has demonstrated high eﬃciency to obtain in a uniform way the
general expressions for the operators of physical quantities as well as for
their matrix elements, covering the both cases of diagonal and non-diagonal
ones with respect to quantum numbers of electronic conﬁgurations. There-
fore it is fairly promising to formulate this methodology in a complete and
consistent way for an arbitrary number of electronic shells with its successive
implementation in the universal computer codes.

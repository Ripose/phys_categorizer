Abstract. We performed an extensive study of conﬁguration mixing between the
doubly excited (doorway) states and complex multiply excited states of U28+ near its
ionization threshold. The detailed investigation of complex spectrum and analysis of
the statistics of eigenstate components show that the dielectronic (doorway) states
weakly mixed with each other. However, they show substantial mixing with the
complex multiply excited states. This situation explains the mechanism of low energy
electron recombination with U28+. We calculated the energy averaged capture cross
sections as a sum over dielectronic doorway states and found our present calculation
interprets well the experimental recombination rates in the energy range of 1 to 100
eV.

1. Introduction

Atomic processes are of great importance from astrophysical and other various point
of view. Especially the low energy recombination cross sections and rate coeﬃcients
In particular
are required for understanding the fusion and astrophysical plasmas.
dielectronic recombination (DR) plays a signiﬁcant role in astrophysics because it is
the dominant electron-ion recombination process for most ions in low density, photo-
ionized and electron-ionized cosmic plasmas [1]. Accurate rate coeﬃcients are needed to
calculate reliably the ionization balance, thermal structure and line emission of cosmic
plasmas. Most importantly the low energy positron antiproton recombination provides
a challenging scheme for the production of antihydrogen[2].

It is well-known that due to the presence of additional recombination channels
such as DR, the rate coeﬃcients are found to be larger than radiative recombination
(RR) rates for many electron complex ions.
In DR process the incident electron is
captured in a doubly-excited state of the compound ion, which is then stabilized by
photoemission. This process originally suggested by J. Sayers and was ﬁrst considered

Recombination of low energy electrons with U28+

by Massey and Bates[3] in the study of ionospheric oxygen. Electron-ion recombination
has been measured directly in the laboratory since early 1980’s [4]. More recently the use
of heavy-ion accelerators and electron coolers of ion storage rings has greatly advanced
the experiment [5, 6]. Recombination rates for various ions have been measured at
electron energies from threshold to hundreds of electron volts (eV) with a fraction-of-
an-eV resolution [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. For few-electron ions the measured rates
were found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions which included the
contribution of DR resonances on top of the RR background, e.g., in He+ [14], Li-like
C4+ [13] and Ar15+ [7, 12], and B-like Ar13+ [15]. However, more complicated ions, e.g.,
Au50+ [11], U28+[10] and Au25+[16], showed complicated resonance spectra and strongly-
enhanced recombination rates at low electron energies. The Au25+ ion has been studied
in detail by Gribakin et al.[18] and Flambaum et al.[20] using statistical methods. They
suggested that the strongly enhanced low energy electron recombination observed in
this ion is mediated by complex multiply-excited states rather than simple dielectronic
resonances and the dielectronic resonances play the role of doorways to the electron
capture process. The statistical method developed by Flambaum et al.[20] is based on
the assumption of strong (chaotic) conﬁguration mixing. This assumption has been
veriﬁed by Gribakin and Sahoo [19] in a recent study. However, for U28+, no theory so
far has described the low energy DR process successfully.

Historically the recombination rate enhancement was observed ﬁrst in U28+[10].
This measurement has been performed in a merged beam experiments at UNILAC
accelerator in Darmstadt and at heavy-ion storage ring TSR in Heidelberg. The
experiment found rate enhancement in the U28+ spectrum exceeds the theoretical
calculation by at least a factor 20 in the energy range below 10 eV. Later in 1998, they
extended the experiment to high energies up to 420 eV [17] and a comparison has been
made with the theoretical calculations which is based on distorted wave approximations.
The DR cross sections are calculated in this method are able to explain the main
resonant features in the range 80–180 eV, but failed to identify the resonances and
reproduce the rate at smaller energies. The cross sections involving the excitations from
the 5s25p2 ground state conﬁguration calculated in this method are well described by
using either semirelativistic wave functions as found in AUTOSTRUCTURE codes or
fully relativistic wave functions in HULLAC codes. However, the resonance structure
observed at low energies i.e. below 80 eV largely remains unexplained. They ﬁnally
concluded that in complex ions, particularly in U28+ ion, what are the resonances just
above the threshold and how they contribute to the low energy recombination remain
a ’mystery’.
In this paper we performed an extensive study of the excited spectra
and eigenstates of U28+ near its ionization threshold and calculated recombination rate
coeﬃcients for electron recombination with U28+. We identiﬁed some of the resonances
near the threshold those contribute signiﬁcantly to the low energy recombination. The
present results are found to be in good agreement with the experiment. This work
develops further a statistical theory towards the full understanding of the mechanism
of low energy electron recombination with U28+ and other similar complex ions.

2. Many-electron excitations

We consider the recombination of an electron with U28+. Due to electron correlation the
slow electron can be captured in one of the excited states of the compound ion U27+.
It has 65 electrons and its ground state conﬁguration belongs to 1s2........5s25p3. Figure
1 shows the spectrum of relativistic nlj orbitals obtained by relativistic Hartree-Fock
calculations. Atomic units (a.u.) are used unless otherwise stated. All the occupied

orbitals below fermi level (
of U28+ground state. Each of excited orbitals above the fermi level are calculated by
placing one electron on to it in the frozen 1s2........5s25p2 (U28+) core. Our conﬁguration
interaction (CI) calculation shows that the ground state of U28+ and U27+ ions are
characterized by their total angular momentum J = 0.0 and 1.5 respectively. The
27771.37 a.u., gives us an
diﬀerence between their total energies

The excited states of the ion are generated by transferring one, two, three, etc.,
electrons from the ground state into the empty orbitals above fermi level. Since we
are interested in the excited spectrum of the ion near its ionization threshold (29.97
a.u.), we consider it as a system of having only 29 electrons above the frozen Kr-like
1s2....4p6 core. The number of many-electron states obtained by distributing 29 electrons
over 40 relativistic orbitals, 4d3/2 through to 8g9/2 are huge in number. It is practically
impossible to perform a CI calculation for all of them. We construct the excite spectrum
by using mean ﬁeld approach by calculating their mean energies Ei, and number of many

This situation explains why individual resonances appear in recombination rates of U28+
but the same is not observed in Au25+ experimentally even at an energy resolution of 0.1
eV. However, the large density of multiply-excited states is only a “kinematic” reason
behind the experimental observation. To explain the fact that the electron can actually
be captured into these states, we need to analyze the dynamics of electron capture and
show that the residual Coulomb interaction between the electrons (i.e.
that beyond
the mean ﬁeld) makes for an eﬃcient capture and accounts for the observed enhanced
recombination rate.

Taking into account the fact that the rasidual Coulomb interaction is the key problem
in many-electron processes, we construct the basis of many-electron states Φk from
single-particle (e.g., Dirac-Fock) orbitals, and solve the eigenvalue problem for the
Hamiltonian matrix Hik =
, which yields the eigenvalues Eν and eigenstates

of the system (conﬁguration interaction method). We performed

two sets of model calculations. One includs all the conﬁgurations within
1 a.u. of
±
ionization threshold of U28+, which produces 2516 states for J π= 7
sequence. Similarly
2
the second calculation includes all the dielectronic (doorway) states within
1 a.u. of
ionization threshold and produces 108 states for J π= 7
sequence. This shows that the
2
number of states associated with the dielectronic conﬁgurations for a given J π are not
large in number. As a result we performed the full CI calculations for Hamiltonian
matrix of size 108 and 2516 respectively and obtained the eigen values and eigenstate
components. To study the mixing between the doubly excited states we analyze the
eigenstate components by calculating the weight of a given doorway conﬁguration shown
2,
in Figure 4(a)-(e). The weight (w) of a doorway state can be calculated as Σk=1,N c|
where Nc is the number of states in each conﬁguration. It has been shown in Ref[19]
that when there is strong and uniform conﬁguration mixing the weights signiﬁcantly
reduce from 1, but in the present case the weights go down from 1 but not signiﬁcantly.
So one can say that these doubly excited (doorways) states weakly mix with each other.
When they are included in the large calculation (2516 states), their weights signiﬁcantly
go down from 1 as shown in Figure 4(f)-(j). This gives a signature of strong mixing i.e.,
the doorways show a signiﬁcant mixing with multiply excited states. It has also been
observed that the multiply excited conﬁgurations mix with each other quite comfortably.
This mixing is mainly responsible for an enhancement of recombination rates over RR.
In the recombination cross sections, the doorways which do not mix completely with
either multiply excited states or with other doorways (in a sense they remain ’isolated’)
appear in the form of narrow peaks (resonances) which explains the experiment as well
as the theory[17].

On the other hand, when the level density is high and the two-body interaction
is suﬃciently strong the system is driven into a regime of many-body quantum chaos,
where the eﬀect of conﬁguration mixing can be described statistically in the case of
Au25+[18]. This regime is characterized by the following [26, 27]. (i) Each eigenstate
contains a large number N of principal components C (ν)
1/√N , corresponding to the
basis states Φk which are strongly mixed together. (ii) Owing to the strong mixing, the
only good quantum numbers that can be used to classify the eigenstates, are the exactly
conserved total angular momentum and parity J π and the energy. (iii) The degree of
mixing in this regime is in some sense complete, i.e. all basis states that can be mixed
(within a certain energy rage, see below) are mixed. The notion of conﬁgurations based
on the single-particle orbitals becomes largely irrelevant for the purpose of classifying
the eigenstates. Each eigenstate contains substantial contributions of a few nearby

conﬁgurations. As mentioned above, in the present case we found that there is a weak
conﬁguration mixing between the dielectronic doorway conﬁgurations and complicated
multiply excited states, and the multiply excited states show a substantially strong
conﬁguration mixing with each other. But the degree of mixing is not suﬃciently strong
to drive the system into chaotic regime.

that a few number of the doorways having energies close to the threshold participate in
mixing. However the middle ﬁgure shows a picture of strong but non uniform mixing
which involves a lots of multiply excited states. When we included the IPR of doorways
with the IPR obtained from large calculation as shown in the bottom ﬁgure, it lies well
below as indicated by solid circles. It also provides us with an information that some
of the doorways take part in mixing with multiply excited conﬁgurations and other
doorways are weakly mixed or even remain isolated.

and (e) 0.2310 a.u.. These doorways are same as indicated in Fig4.

The mean-squared components are obtained by averaging over the basis states

eigen energies. We obtained Γspr of doorways (close to the ionization threshold) from

the BW ﬁt which is shown in Figure 6(a)-(e). From the BW ﬁt we observed that the
Γspr is not constant and it varies from 0.1 a.u. to 0.2 a.u. in these doorways. There may
be doorways which even show much less spreading. Roughly one can say the mixing
takes place within 0.1 a.u.. So we calculated the recombination rates with two diﬀerent
values of spreading width which can be found in section IV. It may be pointed out that
though the single BW ﬁt is not as accurate as it should be, still it gives an estimation
of the important quantity i.e. Γspr. It is worth mentioning that the spreading width
found in Au25+ is about 0.5 a.u.[18] and these value does not change if one performs
calculations by adding more conﬁgurations[19].

In a situation when there is a strong conﬁguration mixing between the dielectronic
doorway states and multiply excited states, the capture cross sections can be obtained
as a sum over the single-electron excited states α, β and hole states γ, as well as the
partial waves lj of the continuous-spectrum electron ε. As a result, we have

It is assumed that the energies of dielectronic doorway states relative to the
threshold is given by εα + εβ - εγ. A more accurate value can be obtained by using mean
ﬁeld energies (conﬁguration energies) of doorway conﬁgurations in Eq.(10). The eﬀect of
using these two diﬀerent energies can be found in next subsection. We have also shown
the the qualitative diﬀerence between the results obtained by using two diﬀerent values
of Γspr. Because Γspr is well deﬁned in the case of a strong and chaotic conﬁguration
mixing. However, it can not be properly deﬁned if the mixing of the conﬁgurations is
weak and non-uniform.

Equation (10) is directly applicable to targets with closed-shell ground states. If

the target ground state contains partially occupied orbitals, a factor

where nα, nβ, and nγ are the orbital occupation numbers in the ground state Φi, must
be introduced on the right-hand side of Eq. (10). Steps similar to those that lead to Eq.
(10) were used to obtain mean-squared matrix elements of operators between chaotic
many-body states [27, 28].

The chaotic nature of the multiply-excited states Ψν can also be employed to
estimate their radiative widths Γ(r)
ν . Electron-photon interaction is described by a single-
particle dipole operator ˆd. Any excited electron in Ψν may emit a photon, thus leading to
radiative stabilization of this state. The total photo-emission rate Γ(r)
can be estimated

is the reduced dipole operator between the orbitals α
and β, and
iν is the mean occupation number factor. Since Ψν have large numbers of
principal components N, their radiative widths display small 1/√N ﬂuctuations. This
can also be seen if one recalls that a chaotic multiply-excited state is coupled by photo-
emission to many lower-lying states, and the total radiative width is the sum of a large
number of (strongly ﬂuctuating) partial widths. A similar eﬀect is known in compound
nucleus resonances in low-energy neutron scattering [21].

There is a certain similarity between Eqs. (10) and (12) and those for autoionisation
and radiative rates obtained in a so-called conﬁguration-average approximation [29].
In both cases the answers involve squares or products of two-body Coulomb matrix
elements [see the direct and exchange terms in Eq.
(10)], or single-particle dipole
amplitudes [Eq. (12)]. However, there are a number of important diﬀerences between
the present results and the conﬁguration-average approximation. The latter considers
dielectronic recombination and introduces averaging over conﬁgurations as a means of
simplifying the calculation. The DR cross section is averaged over an arbitrary energy

average. Eﬀects of conﬁguration mixing as well as level mixing within a conﬁguration
are neglected.

It is important to compare the radiative and autoionisation widths of chaotic
multiply-excited states. Equation (12) shows that Γ(r) is comparable to the single-
particle radiative widths. On the other hand, the autoionisation width Γ(a), is suppressed
N −1 relative to that of a typical dielectronic resonance. Therefore,
by a factor
in systems with dense spectra of chaotic multiply-excited states the autoionisation
widths are small. Physically this happens because the coupling strength of a two-
electron doorway state to the continuum is shared between many complicated multiply-
excited eigenstates. As a result, the radiative width may dominate the total width of
Γ(a), making their ﬂuorescence yield close to unity. However,

of the ﬁnal state [18]. Here Zi is the ionic charge (Zi = 28 for U28+), and n0 is the
principal quantum number of the lowest unoccupied ionic orbital (n0 = 5). Note that
the direct and energy-averaged resonance recombination cross sections of Eqs. (13) and
(8) have similar energy dependences.

4.2. Numerical results

Numerical calculations of the cross section from Eqs. (10) and (11) involve summation
1 with electron partial waves up to i11/2. The
over the orbitals shown in Fig.
results of the calculations for the recombination rates are displayed in Figure 7. We

agreement. However, the magnitude of recombination rates obtained from both the
present calculations lie above the experimental rates. This is due to the fact that we used
ωf = 1 in the present calculations similar to that in Au25+. It is clear that in the present
case ωf is less than 1 and remains constant throughout the energy range considered.
The exchange contributions are found to be about 200 times smaller than the direct
one so we did not include these when calculated the ﬁnal rates. The radiative rates are
found to be smaller in magnitude in comparison to DR rates and have almost negligible
interference with the resonances. It may be pointed out that the present calculation with
0.15 a.u, does not show enough resonance structures as have been

observed in the experiment. Hence, we performed another calculation with Γspr ∼
a.u. and compared with the results obtained using spreading with 0.15 a.u. shown in

Recombination of low energy electrons with U28+

Figure 8. It is clear that the results do not show any change in magnitude. However,
0.05 interprets the resonance peaks very well which are in
the calculation with Γspr ∼
reasonable agreement with the experiment, though the position of peaks are diﬀerent
from the experiment. This is because the present energies of the doorway states are
approximate and a few eV relative error is expected in this approach. The presence of
narrow peaks in rate coeﬃcients can be interpreted as: the dielectronic states which
play the role doorway to the electron capture process weakly mix with each other as
has been discussed in previous section and appear as single peaks. Because in statistical
calculations one peak corresponds to one doorway state. It may be recalled that the
distorted wave calculation[17], predicts the recombination rates in agreement with the
experiment above 80 eV and below this energy the results are smaller in magnitude.

Table 1 lists the most important dielectronic doorway contributions to the

width to the spacing between the resonances. In total they account for about two thirds
of the total cross section. Although these transitions have been selected according to
the size of their contribution, their energies from two diﬀerent calculations are close

present calculations show that excitations involving 4f orbitals are more important
especially at threshold since they contribute signiﬁcantly to the recombination cross
sections. As expected, the energy dependences of the resonance and direct recombination
rates are very close, although the latter is about 200 times smaller. There is a good
overall agreement between the resonance rate and experimental data at electron energies
between 1 eV and 100 eV. To compare with Au25+, we calculated the rate coeﬃcients for

the electron energy ranging from 1 eV to 100 eV. Because the previous calculation[20]
was restricted to the energy range below 1 eV. Figure 9 shows results three diﬀerent
calculations and the experimental data. It may be seen that the present (we call our
best calculation) calculation uses conﬁguration energies shows a very good qualitative
agreement with the experiment in comparison to the other two calculations. The RR
is found be of smaller in magnitude. The most striking feature in this graph is that
the experimental data quickly departs from the theoretical values as one goes to higher
energies. This can be interpreted as that in this energy range the ﬂuorescence yield
certainly goes down from 1 which can be well understood from the Figure 10. In this
ﬁgure we show the conﬁguration energies as a function of total angular momentum J.
It shows that due to the presence of a lots levels, many inelastic channels open up and
they participate strongly. This situation makes the ﬂuorescence yield less than 1 and
hence the theory predicts recombination rates higher in magnitude.

Which in turn just opposite to the case of U28+ as shown in Figure 11.
Finally, we compare in table II, the present energies of the lowest conﬁgurations
in U28+ with the energies calculated by using HULLAC code[17]. As mentioned

5. Summary and outlook

We have shown that the dielectronic states weakly mix with each other and show
a substantial mixing with complicated multiply excited states. This explains the
mechanism of low energy recombination of electron with U28+. The present results are
found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. We found that one must not
ignore the excitations from 4f orbitals while considering the low energy recombination
of U28+ ion. On detailed study, we found the conﬁguration mixing between the doubly
excited states and multiply excited states is not complete or uniform. Although this
theory is valid in a system having an extreme degree of conﬁguration mixing [20],
still it predicts quite good results for other systems where there is not enough strong
conﬁguration mixing, for example U28+. This work develops further a statistical theory
to study the low energy recombination process.

[23] This ﬁt is valid for E > 1 a.u. In the Fermi-gas model a is related to the single-particle level
density at the Fermi level g(εF ) = 3a2/2π2. The ﬁtted value a = 3.99 gives g(εF ) = 2.4 a.u., in
agreement with the orbital spectrum in Fig.1

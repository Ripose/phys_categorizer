Abstract
We study elementary particle reactions that result from the interaction of an atomic system
with a very intense laser wave of circular polarization. That is, we consider high-energy processes
induced by e+e− annihilation, where the e+ and e− originate from a positronium atom that is
submitted to a superstrong laser ﬁeld. As a speciﬁc example, we calculate the rate for the laser-
driven reaction e+e−
µ+µ−. The threshold intensity of this process is almost reached by the most
powerful present laser systems. Apart from numerical calculations, we derive by analytical means
a compact formula for the corresponding reaction rate. The latter turns out to be very small due
to the destructive interference of the various partial waves that constitute the positronium ground-
state wave packet. In addition, the related process of muon creation by a superintense laser beam
interacting with a nonrelativistic e+e− plasma is considered.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of electrons and atoms with laser radiation is intensively and successfully
being studied for many years now. However, due to a rapid technological progress, the high-
power laser systems available today can generate peak intensities up to 1022 W/cm2 in the
range of near-optical infrared frequencies [1], and a further increase can be expected within
the next few years [2]. Consequently, the ponderomotive energy of an e− (or e+) inside
such a laser wave is of the order of 1 GeV, which is far beyond the typical energetic range
of atomic physics but rather reaches the energy scale characteristic for elementary particle
physics. If electrons or an e− and e+ collide at such high energies, then particle reactions
like heavy lepton-pair creation or hadron production can occur. This indicates that there
might be a way to merge laser physics with high-energy physics [3]. Similar eﬀorts are being
undertaken with respect to laser physics and nuclear physics [4, 5, 6].

The high-energy process of photon-induced e+e− pair creation by a projectile particle
colliding with an intense laser beam has already been investigated before, both experimen-
tally [7] and theoretically [8]. An essential ingredient to these studies is the ultrarelativistic
energy of the incoming particle. In its rest frame, the doppler-shifted laser frequency and
ﬁeld strength are considerably enhanced. As a consequence, the projectile actually faces an
x-ray beam of near-critical intensity.

Instead, in the present paper we study a situation where elementary particle reactions
arise from the interaction of a strong laser ﬁeld with a nonrelativistic atomic system. To this
end, we suppose that a positronium (Ps) atom is brought into an intense laser wave. We

note that the lifetimes of ortho-Ps (
than the typical duration of a strong laser pulse. Due to the equal masses of its constituents,
the dynamical response of the positronium to the electromagnetic forces exerted by the laser
ﬁeld is rather unique [9]: The laser’s linearly polarized electric ﬁeld leads to an antiparallel
oscillatory motion of the particles in the transverse direction, while the magnetic Lorentz
force causes an identical ponderomotive drift motion along the laser propagation direction.
This leads to periodic e+e− (re)collisions (see, in particular, Fig. 1 in Ref. [9]). If the energy
of the relative e+e− motion is large enough, then in these microscopic collisions particle
reactions can occur. Thus, we shall study high-energy processes induced by e+e− annihilation
resulting from a laser-driven Ps atom. Considering the case of a circularly polarized laser
ﬁeld we will ﬁnd as a main result, however, that the various partial waves that constitute the
Ps ground-state interfere destructively, which causes a heavy suppression of the (coherent)
reaction rates. Alternatively, the Ps atom could be replaced by a nonrelativistic e+e− plasma
to create an experimental situation which is similar but possibly easier to access.

It should be stressed that in the described setup the e+e− collision energy is basically

above. Here, mc2 is the electron rest energy and ξ = ea/mc2 denotes the so-called laser
e and the laser’s vector potential a. For the
intensity parameter with the electron charge
−
highest intensities attainable at present ξ is of order 102. In this respect, the underlying
laser acceleration of the particles is considerably diﬀerent from the usual laser acceleration
techniques, since the latter try to extract the ponderomotive energy gain along the laser
propagation direction. Nevertheless, the energetic thresholds for muon or pion production
might be within reach. We further notice, that the principal diﬃculties of laser acceleration
implied by the Lawson-Woodward theorem (see, e.g., Ref. [10]) are completely absent here

since the e+ and e− collide inside the laser wave.

Against this background, we consider the speciﬁc process e+e−

µ+µ− which is one
of the most fundamental in high-energy physics.
Its cross section sets the scale for all
e+e− annihilation cross sections [11]. For example, at high energies one has σe+e−→hadrons ≈
4σe+e−→µ+µ−, where σe+e−→hadrons denotes the total cross section for the production of any
number of strongly interacting particles [12]. The threshold energy for the reaction e+e−

µ+µ− amounts to 2Mc2 in the ﬁeld-free case, where M denotes the muon mass. According
to the above, a naive estimate thus suggests that a laser intensity corresponding to ξ
M/m
is reached, e.g., for a linearly polarized laser beam of 3.8
photon energy.

the emphasis lying on the resonances that can occur in the scattering cross-section due to
the interaction of the leptons with the background laser ﬁeld. We will come back to this
point later. Another similar process, that has found the interest of several authors, is the

reaction kinematics. Here we show in particular that the minimal laser intensity parameter
required is indeed given by ξmin = M/m [cf. Eq. (36)]. Further, the kinematical analysis
will help us to derive a compact formula that gives an approximation to the total reaction
rate and displays its main dependences [cf. Eq. (51)]. In Sec. III we present our (numerical)
results on the total and diﬀerential production rates and compare them with the known
cross section for the ﬁeld-free process e+e−
µ+µ−. Furthermore, we brieﬂy consider the

related process of muon pair production by a superstrong laser wave interacting with a
nonrelativistic e+e− plasma. In this situation the interference eﬀect does not play a role.
We ﬁnish with a conclusion.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. Transition amplitude and reaction rate

We want to calculate the rate for positronium decay into muons in a strong laser ﬁeld,
µ+µ−. We assume a photon energy of about
i.e., the rate for the laser-driven process Ps
1 eV and a laser intensity parameter of order M/m
200 or larger [18]. For mathematical
simplicity, the laser ﬁeld is taken to be a monochromatic, plane wave of circular polarization
with the classical four-potential [19]

are constant four-vectors chosen as aµ
2 = (0, 0, a, 0) with a denoting the
amplitude of the vector-potential. From now on we use relativistic units (¯h = c = 1), except

1 = (0, a, 0, 0) and aµ

where otherwise stated. We notice that in the circularly polarized laser ﬁeld (1) the e+ and
e− are permanently colliding since, according to the classical equations of motion, they are
co-rotating in the polarization plane.

The Ps atom is assumed to be initially at rest and in its ground state. In a usual ﬁeld
theoretic formalism [11], this bound initial state can be expressed as a superposition of
products of free states ψp± for the electron and positron with deﬁnite momenta p± =
p.
The superposition is weighted by the probability amplitude ˜Φ(p) for ﬁnding a particular
value of p. Note that this amplitude is just the Compton proﬁle of the Ps ground state (i.e.,
the Fourier transform of its wave function) and p can be viewed as the relative momentum
of the electron-positron two-body system (i.e., as the momentum of an eﬀective particle of
reduced mass m/2). When submitted to the strong laser ﬁeld (ξ >
200) the Ps atom will
∼
instantaneously be ionized, and the dynamics of the ionized e− and e+ will be governed by
the laser ﬁeld, which predominates over the inﬂuence of the Coulomb interaction between
the particles. Therefore, in the spirit of the strong-ﬁeld approximation theories [20], we
may replace the free leptonic states ψp± by laser-dressed Volkov states [21, 22]. Within this
framework, the amplitude for the laser-driven process Ps

Like free states, the Volkov states in Eq. (5) are normalized to a δ-function in p± space
[22, 25]. Analogous expressions hold for the Volkov states ΨP±,S±, the free momenta P±, the
spin states S±, the eﬀective momenta Qµ
±, the eﬀective mass M∗ = M(1 + Ξ2)1/2, and the
intensity parameter Ξ = ea/M of the muons. Note that the amplitude (3) fully accounts
for the interaction of the leptons with the laser ﬁeld, while their interaction with the QED
vacuum is taken into account to lowest order. Similar approaches have been used for the
theoretical description of laser-assisted e+e− [13] and e−e− [14, 15, 16, 17] scattering.

0 as it would follow from
the Compton proﬁle ˜Φ(p) alone. We note that 2λξ gives the average impact parameter
of the e+e− collisions since, according to their classical trajectories, the particles co-rotate
in the polarization plane on opposite sides of a circle of radius λξ. However, the classical
picture suggests that the process probability is proportional to (a0/λξ)2. Instead, this factor
is contained in the process amplitude such that the probability scales as (a0/λξ)4. This
indicates that the damping factor is truely of quantum mechanical origin.

For these reasons one can say that the muon kinematics is similar to that of the laser pho-
tons. This ”photon-like” nature of the muons results from the fact that they are essentially
produced by a huge number of laser photons whose total energy, according to Eq. (27),
exceeds the initial nonrelativistic energy of the e− and e+ by orders of magnitude.

According to Eq. (20), the process amplitude is proportional to the factor (β/r)2 which
is close to unity for ξ >

¯r, which at
ξ = ξmin is twice as large as the minimal number of photons: ¯r = 2rmin.

It is interesting to observe that the typical muon momenta in Eq. (35) can be interpreted
by employing a classical simple man’s model of the creation process. In the classical picture,
the threshold value of the laser intensity (36) corresponds to the situation when, in the
center-of-mass frame of the e+e− system, the kinetic energy is large enough to create muons
at rest. I.e., denoting the laser phase by τ

z), we have

ω(t

at the creation phase τ0, where the prime indicates the center-of-mass frame. The classical
equation of motion for a muon in a laser ﬁeld with the initial condition (37) has the solution

Consequently, after the interaction with the laser ﬁeld the muon momenta equal

Due to the e+e− longitudinal drift motion in the laser ﬁeld, the relative velocity between the
center-of-mass frame and the lab frame amounts to vrel = qz/q0 = ξ2/(2 + ξ2) [see Eq. (6)].
The Lorentz transformation to the lab frame thus yields

Our simple man’s model can also explain a peculiarity in the angular distribution of the
P⊥, the muons move in a narrow cone with
muons (see Fig. 4 in Sec. III. A). Since Pz ≫
the axis parallel to the laser propagation direction, but at very small angles the angular
spectrum has a dip. The dark region in the angular distribution occurs because the muons,
although having been created with zero transverse momentum in the laser ﬁeld, acquire a
nonvanishing transverse momentum after switching oﬀ the laser ﬁeld [see Eqs. (37) and (38)].

desirable to ﬁnd, by analytical means, an approximation to Eq. (22) that displays its main
physical content. To this end, we consider the contribution to the total rate stemming from
the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (16). From our numerical calculations we learn

Here we have assumed that each Ps atom independently creates a muon pair, i.e. there
is no interference between electrons (positrons) stemming from diﬀerent Ps atoms. The
latter is the case when the electron wave-packets from diﬀerent atoms do not overlap, i.e.
n−1/3, where n is the Ps density. Otherwise, when the spatial extension of the
when λξ
electron wave-packet is large, then the gas of Ps atoms transforms into an e+e− plasma and
the advantage of using Ps atoms is lost. Against this background, in the following we will
denote the rate in Eq. (55) resp. (22) as the coherent rate for muon production since the
colliding e+ and e− originate from one and the same Ps atom. In contrast to that, the rate
for muon creation from an e+e− plasma, that might have been formed from an initial Ps
gas, will be refered to as incoherent rate. In this situation, electrons and positrons from
diﬀerent Ps atoms can collide which gives a total number of N 2 incoherent collisions. In the
next section we will present our results both on the coherent and the incoherent channel of
muon production.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Muon pair creation by a laser-driven Ps atom: The coherent process

Based on Eq. (22), we have numerically calculated the coherent rate for µ+µ− pair creation
from a single Ps atom submitted to a strong laser ﬁeld of circular polarization. The laser
frequency has been taken to be ω = 1 eV, throughout. For the laser intensity parameter
we have chosen the three diﬀerent values ξ = 250, 500, and 1000. The corresponding
1024 W/cm2,
laser intensities amount to 1.1
respectively.

In Fig. 2, the dependence of the total muon creation rate on the laser intensity parameter
is shown. For the intensity parameters under consideration we ﬁnd production rates of

≫
A total production rate of 10−23 sec−1 means that in a ﬁnite laser pulse of 10−12 sec
duration the probability to create a muon pair is of the order of 10−35. We notice that the
highest positronium densities achievable at present are of the order of 108 cm−3, so that a
typical laser focal volume will contain only one Ps atom on average. The above numbers
seem too small to be experimentally accessible. Clearly, the main reason for the smallness
10−26 [cf. Eq. (20)]. The
of the coherent reaction rate lies in the damping factor (a0/λξ)4

packet in the laser ﬁeld, which makes the recollision of an e+ and e− from the same Ps atom
highly unlikely. From a simpliﬁed, classical point of view, the reason for the damping lies in
the large collisional impact parameter of order λξ that is due to the equal handed rotations
of the particles in the laser polarization plane [30].

1010 (ξ = 250), 6.4

In Fig. 3, the partial production rates with respect to the number r of absorbed laser
photons are shown (i.e., the contributions to the total rate stemming from a net absorption
of r laser photons in the production process). The photon number is given in units of
1010 (ξ = 500), and
(ξ2/2)(mc2/ω), which amounts to 1.6
r0 ≈
1011 (ξ = 1000), respectively. The shape of the curves in Fig. 3 can be understood with
2.6
×
the help of the kinematical analysis in Sec. II. B. First, according to Eq. (26), the minimal
1010,
number of laser photons required from kinematical constraints amounts to rmin = 2.2
independent of the laser intensity. If we express this number with respect to the respective
values of r0, then we get rmin/r0 = 1.4 (ξ = 250), 0.3 (ξ = 500), and 0.1 (ξ = 1000).
The partial reaction rate for r = rmin is always zero, as can be seen in Fig. 3. Further, in
agreement with Eq. (33), the curves exhibit maxima at r
¯r; for ξ = 250 the maximum
is located at ¯r/r0 ≈
8. This feature
reﬂects the mathematical properties of the Bessel functions and is correctly predicted by our
simple man’s model. Finally, for the larger values of ξ, the distributions show an increase
towards smaller photon numbers. This is due to the factor (β/r)4 in Eq. (20) which can be
considerably larger than unity in this region (see above). For ξ = 250 no such enhancement
occurs since here we always have β/r

0.07◦ and extending to 4.7

Figure 4 shows the angular distribution dR/dθQ for one of the produced muons. For
symmetry reasons, the spectra for the muon µ− and the antimuon µ+ are identical. The
diﬀerential rate is expressed with respect to the polar angle θQ = 6 (k, Q) of the eﬀective
muon momentum. The value of the laser intensity parameter is chosen to be ξ = 250.
One can see that the muon is emitted into a very narrow angular range starting from
0.27◦, which is in agreement
10−3 rad
10−3 rad

≈
with Eq. (50).
In other words, as has already been mentioned before, the muon moves
practically parallel to the propagation direction of the laser beam. The occurence of a
minimal emission angle arises from the fact that, according to Eq. (32), the argument of the
Bessel function is proportional to the transverse momentum component Q⊥, which itself is
θQ. Thus, the emission angle cannot be too small because otherwise
proportional to sin θQ ≈
the Bessel function will vanish. Since P⊥ = Q⊥, a dark angular region also exists in the
angular spectrum dR/dθP with respect to the muon momentum outside the laser beam. An
alternative explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a simple man’s model has been given
at the end of Sec. II. B.

the laser-dressed collision energy is thus about 1 GeV. Hence, the reference cross section

1 GeV, where its value is about
100 nbarn. To transform this cross section into a reaction rate, we have to multipy by the
incident particle ﬂux. In collider experiments, instead of the incoming ﬂux, the luminosity
is more commonly used. When a beam of N+ positrons collides at high energy with a beam

C. Muon production from laser-plasma interaction: The incoherent process

We have seen in Sec. III. A that the large electron-positron wave-packet size during the
motion in the laser ﬁeld suppresses the coherent reaction rate dramatically. To reduce
this size and achieve e+e− collisions at microscopic impact parameters, one can think of
employing diﬀerent, more complicated ﬁeld conﬁgurations [3]. Otherwise, the muon creation
from Ps atoms will be dominated by the incoherent production channel introduced at the
end of Sec. II. C. The latter coincides with the process of muon creation, when a low-energy
e+e− plasma interacts with a strong laser beam. We have redone our calculation for this
situation, i.e., for a free, initially nonrelativistic e+ and e− that collide in a strong laser
ﬁeld and create a µ+µ− pair by annihilation. Our results on the partial production rates
for reasonable experimental parameters (see below) are shown in Fig. 5. The shape of the
ξmin and
curves is quite similar to those in Fig. 3. Major diﬀerences only exist for ξ
small values of the photon number r. They are due to the missing interference factor of
(βa0/rα′)4
(β/r)4 that arose from the average over the Ps ground-state [see Eq. (20)].
Therefore, in the plasma case, the curves only exhibit the maximum at r

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have studied µ+µ− production by e+e− annihilation from a laser-driven
Ps atom. To this end, a calculational framework has been developed where the initial bound
state is described as a superposition of Volkov states weighted by the Compton proﬁle of
the Ps ground state. By virtue of the interaction with the QED vacuum, which is treated in
the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory, this initial state can decay into a laser-dressed µ+µ−
pair. Also, the related process of muon creation by the interaction of a strong laser ﬁeld
with a low-energy e+e− plasma has been examined.

We have found that the minimal laser intensity required for the process to occur corre-
sponds to an intensity parameter of ξ
200. In the case of a near-optical laser wave
≈
1022 W/cm2. This
of circular polarization, e.g., this value is reached for an intensity of 7
means that, starting from a nonrelativistic Ps atom or e+e− plasma, fundamental particle
reactions can be ignited by a superstrong laser ﬁeld of an intensity that is just one order of
magnitude larger than the highest values available today.

However, in the Ps case, the total production rate resulting from the coherent recollisions
is extremely small and amounts to about 10−23 per second only. The strong suppression is
caused by a destructive interference of the diﬀerent partial waves constituting the bound
initial state in the superintense laser ﬁeld. This phenomenon is also expressed by a compact
formula for the total rate that we derived by analytical means. As a consequence, in the
considered setup the production rate will be dominated by the muon creation via incoherent
e+e− scattering, for which the system of Ps atoms has no advantage compared to an e+e−
plasma. For the incoherent collisions, the interference plays no role and the resulting muon
creation rate is signiﬁcantly larger than the corresponding rate from the coherent production
channel. Nevertheless, very demanding experimental conditions are required in order to
achieve observable muon yields.

Finally, we note that similar reaction rates can be expected for laser-driven π+π−
production from e+e− or µ+µ−. A more promising alternative might be the process
e+e−
e+e− + e+e−, the ﬁeld-free cross section of which being several orders of magnitude
larger than the one for µ+µ− creation in Eq. (56) [32].

[12] After their creation from e+e− annihilation, the strong force acting between a quark and
an antiquark leads to the production of more quark pairs, that eventually materialize into a
stream of mesons and/or baryons. Therefore, the easiest quantity to measure experimentally
is the total cross section for production of all hadrons.

[18] Electrons and positrons in a laser wave emit radiation due to Thomson scattering [see, e.g.,
E.S. Sarachik and G.T. Schappert, Phys. Rev. D 1, 2738 (1970)]. This eﬀect is not taken into
account here. By an application of the Larmor formula, the fraction of the particle’s energy
10−2
radiated in one laser cycle can be estimated as αf ξ2ω/m, which is of the order of 10−3
for the laser parameters under consideration. So, despite of the high laser intensities assumed,
the neglect of the radiative energy loss still is a reasonable approximation.

Becker and H. Mitter, J. Phys. A 8, 1638 (1975)]. In the present situation, however, the free
propagator can safely be used since the intermediate photon is always far away from the mass

[30] The transversal extension of the e+e− motion is even larger than a typical laser focal cross
section. Further, it is worth mentioning that the average distance between the e+ and e−
moving along their classical trajectories is larger than the spatial separation that results form
the quantum mechanical spreading of the Ps wave packet in the laser ﬁeld. According to the
classical equations of motion, the scale of the latter can be estimated as αf λξ (see, e.g., Ref.
[3]).

It has recently become possible to form molecules in ultracold gases of trapped alkali metal
atoms. Once formed, the molecules may undergo elastic, inelastic and reactive collisions. Inelastic
and reactive collisions are particularly important because they release kinetic energy and eject atoms
and molecules from the trap. The theory needed to handle such collisions is presented and recent
quantum dynamics calculations on ultracold atom-diatom collisions of spin-polarised Li + Li2, Na +
Na2 and K + K2 are described. All these systems have potential energy surfaces on which barrierless
atom exchange reactions can occur, and both inelastic and reactive rates are very fast (typically
kinel > 10

−1 in the Wigner regime).

temperature to the milliKelvin regime by a variety of
methods including buﬀer-gas cooling [1, 2] and Stark
deceleration [3, 4]. Molecules have also been produced
in ultracold atomic gases by photoassociation [5, 6] and
magnetoassociation [5, 7] of pairs of atoms. Long-lived
molecular Bose-Einstein condensates have been produced
for dimers of fermionic alkali metal atoms [8, 9, 10],
and the ﬁrst signatures of ultracold triatomic [11] and
tetraatomic [12] molecules have been observed.

Cold and ultracold molecules have many possible appli-
cations. High-resolution spectroscopy on cold molecules
may allow the measurement of fundamental physical
properties such as the electric dipole moment of the elec-
tron [13], the energy diﬀerences between enantiomers
[14, 15] and the time-dependence of the ﬁne-structure
constant [16]. In addition, since molecules have a much
richer energy level structure than atoms, they oﬀer many
new possibilities for quantum control. Perhaps most im-
portantly, dipolar molecules interact with one another
much more strongly and at longer range than atoms.
Dipolar molecules have been proposed as qubits for quan-
tum computers [17] and dipolar quantum gases are pre-
dicted to exhibit a range of novel features [18].

INTRODUCTION

There have been enormous recent advances in our abil-
ity to produce and trap samples of cold molecules (below
1 K) and ultracold molecules (below 1 mK). Molecules
such as NH3, OH and NH have been cooled from room

In a recent article [5], we reviewed the current state of
the art of molecule production in ultracold atomic gases.
Other authors have reviewed the cooling of molecules
from near room temperature [3, 4] and the theory of col-
lisions of such directly cooled molecules [19, 20, 21]. The
present article is complementary to these and focusses on
recent theoretical work on the collisions of alkali metal
dimers formed in ultracold gases.

EXPERIMENTS ON ULTRACOLD MOLECULE
FORMATION AND COLLISIONS

There are two main methods used to form molecules in
ultracold atomic gases. In photoassociation [5, 6], a pair
of atoms undergoes a spectroscopic transition from an
unbound atomic state very close to threshold to a bound
In magnetoassociation, also known as
molecular state.
Feshbach resonance tuning [5, 7], the transition is accom-
plished by guiding the atom pair adiabatically across an
avoided crossing between an unbound state and a molec-
ular state.

Feshbach resonance tuning always produces molecules
in very highly excited states, usually the highest vibra-
tional state that exists in the diatomic potential well.
Photoassociation also usually produces molecules in very
high vibrational states, because they are the ones that
have the best Franck-Condon overlap with the free-atom
states.

Ultracold molecules are initially formed in the pres-
ence of ultracold atoms and can collide with them. For
molecules in vibrationally excited states, there is the pos-
sibility of vibrationally inelastic collisions,

M2(v) + M −→ M2(v

< v) + M,

(1)

′

where v is the vibrational quantum number. Since the
trap depth is usually much less than 1 K, such collisions
always release enough kinetic energy to eject both colli-
sion partners from the trap. If the molecular density is
high, there is also the possibility of inelastic molecule-
molecule collisions,

M2(v) + M2(v) −→ M2(v

< v) + M2(v

≤ v).

Molecules are not destroyed in inelastic collisions, but
they are lost from the trap and are no longer ultracold.
The initial experiments on molecule formation by Fes-
hbach resonance tuning worked with bosonic isotopes
of alkali metals [22, 23, 24, 25]. They found that the
molecules were lost from the trap on a timescale of mil-
liseconds. The loss was attributed to vibrationally inelas-
tic atom-molecule collisions with relaxation rates around
10−10 cm3 s−1. For the case of 85Rb2 [22], recent work
has suggested that the loss may in fact be due to sponta-
neous molecular dissociation by collisionless spin relax-
ation [26, 27]. However, for the other systems [23, 24, 25]
the molecules are formed in truly bound states and can-
not decay without collisions. Mukaiyama et al. [28] have
recently measured the trap loss rate for 23Na2 molecules
formed by Feshbach resonance tuning and obtained an
atom-molecule rate coeﬃcient kloss = 5.1 × 10−11 cm3
s−1 for molecules in the highest vibrational state.

Fermion dimers formed by Feshbach resonance tuning
are a very special case. In mid-2003, four groups inde-
pendently reported within a very short time that dimers

2

of fermionic 6Li [29, 30, 31] and 40K [32] could be re-
markably stable to collisions. Cubizolles et al. [30] and
Jochim et al. [31] showed that the lifetime was partic-
ularly large close to a Feshbach resonance, where the
scattering length is large and positive. By the end of
2003, three diﬀerent groups [8, 9, 10] had succeeded in
creating long-lived molecular Bose-Einstein condensates
of fermion dimers.

Petrov et al. [33, 34] analysed the stability of fermion
dimers in terms of the long-range form of the wavefunc-
tion. In the case where the atom-atom scattering length
a is much larger than the range of the atom-atom po-
tential re, they showed that both atom-molecule and
molecule-molecule inelastic collision rates are suppressed
by Fermi statistics. However, their derivation applies
only to molecules that are in long-range states, with
a wavefunction that depends on the scattering length,
χ(r) ∼ exp(−r/a). As will be discussed in more detail
below, Cvitaˇs et al. [35] have shown computationally that
there is no systematic suppression of the atom-molecule
inelastic rate for fermion dimers in low-lying vibrational
levels, even when a is large and positive.

Relaxation processes have also been studied for
molecules formed by photoassociation. Wynar et al. [36]
formed 87Rb2 molecules in the second-to-last vibrational
level of the ground excited state by stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP). They estimated an upper
bound of kloss = 8 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 due to inelastic atom-
molecule collisions. Staanum et al. [37] investigated in-
elastic collisions of rovibrationally excited Cs2 (3Σ+
u ) in
collisions with Cs atoms in two diﬀerent ranges of the
vibrational quantum number v by monitoring trap loss
of Cs2. They obtained atom-molecule rate coeﬃcients
close to 1.0 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 for both v = 4 to 6 and
v = 32 to 47. Zahzam et al. [38] carried out similar work
for diﬀerent rovibrational states of 3Σ+
u , and also consid-
ered molecules in the 1Σ+
g state and molecule-molecule
collisions. They obtained rate coeﬃcients of 2.6 × 10−11
cm3 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 in the atom-atom and
atom-molecule cases respectively, both with quite large
error bounds.

Because of the collisional losses for excited vibrational
levels, intense eﬀorts are under way to produce ultracold
alkali metal dimers in low-lying levels (and ultimately
in the ground vibronic state). The process of transfer-
ring molecules from atomic or near-dissociation molecu-
lar states, with probability density at long range, to low-
lying states, with probability density near the diatomic
equilibrium distance re, is sometimes called r-transfer. It
can in principle be achieved either by using many pho-
tons to accomplish the transfer in several stages [39] or
by using tailored ultrafast laser pulses [40, 41, 42].
In
favourable cases, and particularly for heteronuclear al-
kali metal dimers [43, 44], it may be possible to produce
molecules in their vibrational ground state by two-photon
processes via excited states with mixed singlet and triplet

character. Sage et al. [45] have recently succeeded in cre-
ating ultracold RbCs molecules (T ≈ 100 µK) in their
vibronic ground state using a 4-photon process. The
production rate in the current experiments is only 500
molecules/s, but work is under way to increase it.

Inspired by the recent progress in experimental tech-
niques for producing and studying ultracold molecules,
we have collaborated with Jean-Michel Launay and
coworkers at the University of Rennes to produce a series
of theoretical studies [35, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52] on
interactions and collisions between spin-polarized alkali-
metal atoms and molecules.
In particular, ultra-low-
energy collisions were studied for Na + Na2 [46, 48], Li
+ Li2 (isotopically homonuclear [35, 49] and heteronu-
clear [50]), and K + K2 [51]. Collisions between alkali-
metal dimers and atoms present several new theoretical
challenges that are not present for collisions of stabler
molecules. The remainder of this review will focus on de-
scribing this work and drawing general conclusions from
it.

GENERAL ASPECTS OF ALKALI METAL
DIMER COLLISIONS

The atoms in an ultracold quantum gas of S-state
atoms are in states labelled by the electron spin s, the
nuclear spin i, and the total angular momentum f . Since
there is usually a magnetic ﬁeld present, the states are
also labelled by mf , the projection of f along the ﬁeld. Of
particular interest here are spin-stretched states, where
f = fmax = i + s and |mf | = f . From a theoretical
point of view, collisions of atoms and molecules in spin-
stretched states are simpler than others, because they
take place entirely on high-spin potential energy sur-
faces. For alkali metal atoms with s = 1
2 , these are triplet
curves (S = 1) for atom-atom collisions and quartet sur-
faces (S = 3
2 ) for atom-molecule collisions and 3-body
recombination. For atoms in non-spin-stretched states,
singlet dimer curves and doublet trimer surfaces are also
required. Our work so far has focussed on spin-stretched
states.

The lowest quartet state of the alkali metal trimers,
which correlates with ground-state atoms (2S) and
molecules in their lowest triplet state (3Σ+
u ), is desig-
nated (14A′). At ﬁrst sight it might be expected that
three parallel electrons in s orbitals would not form sig-
niﬁcant chemical bonds. If this was the case, then pair-
wise additivity would be a good approximation and the
potential energy surface would be given by

V (r12, r23, r13) ≈

Vdimer(rij ).

The potential energy curve for the lowest triplet state
is reasonably well known for many of the alkali metal

3

dimers [53, 54, 55, 56]. Pairwise-additive model poten-
tials have been extensively used in theoretical studies of
3-body recombination [57, 58, 59, 60].

As will be seen below, pairwise additivity is actually
quite a poor approximation for the alkali metals. Never-
theless, it gives some insights into the energetics of atom-

atom-atom distance re, then for a pairwise-additive sur-
face the energies of various important arrangements of 3
atoms are

• atom M well-separated from diatom M2 with bond

length re,

V (r) = V (re, ∞, ∞) = −ε

• linear trimer M3 with bond length re,

V (r) = V (re, re, 2re) ≈ −2ε

• triangular trimer M3 with bond length re,

V (r) = V (re, re, re) = −3ε.

The topology of the lowest quartet potential energy sur-
face of an alkali-metal trimer is thus quite simple; the
global minimum is at an equilateral triangular conﬁg-
uration (point group D3h) and there is a saddle point
at a symmetric linear conﬁguration (D∞h). The inclu-
sion of nonadditivity deepens the linear and (especially)
triangular trimer wells, but does not change the overall
conclusions.

The potential energy surfaces are such that barrier-
less atom-exchange reactions can occur. All conﬁgura-
tions of the trimer M3 are lower in energy than the sep-
arated atom + diatom collision partners (and products).
Once the collision complex M3 has been formed, any one
of the three atoms can depart to form products. Even
when the products are indistinguishable from the reac-
tants, all three of these “arrangement channels” must
be taken into account in the collision dynamics. This
has two major consequences. First, a reactive scattering
approach (rather than an inelastic scattering approach)
must be used in the dynamics calculations. Secondly,
the scattering calculations must be done on a fully three-
dimensional potential energy surface. This is not the
case for non-reactive scattering, where the products and
reactants are conﬁned to just one arrangement, and two-
dimensional calculations (with the diatomic bond length
kept ﬁxed at the dimer equilibrium geometry) or quasi-
three-dimensional calculations (where the diatomic bond
length is varied only slightly around the dimer equilib-
rium geometry) are usually used.

The major focus of interest is in collisions that release
kinetic energy and thus lead to trap loss. These are typ-
ically vibrational relaxation processes of the type

M2(v) + M −→ M2(v

< v) + M.

However, if the three atoms are identical it is not possi-
ble to distinguish between inelastic processes and reactive
processes. We therefore use the general term quenching
to describe collisions that produce a change in the vi-
brational (or rotational) quantum number and release
kinetic energy.

POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES

Nonadditive forces

Accurate quantum scattering calculations require ac-
curate potential energy surfaces. Higgins et al. [61]
showed in 2000 that the quartet state of Na3 exhibits
strong non-additive forces that increase the well depth
of the equilateral trimer by 59% and decrease the Na-
Na bond length from 5.2 ˚A in the triplet dimer to 4.4
˚A in the quartet trimer. We therefore carried out a
systematic study [47] to investigate such eﬀects for the
whole series of homonuclear alkali-metal trimers. Ab ini-
tio electronic structure calculations were performed using
a single-reference restricted open-shell variant [62] of the
coupled-cluster method [63] with single, double and non-
iterative triple excitations [RCCSD(T)]. Medium/large-
size basis sets were used for the alkali metal atoms as
described in ref. 47, and the full counterpoise correction
of Boys and Bernardi [64] was employed to compensate
for basis-set superposition errors. All the ab initio cal-
culations were performed using the MOLPRO package
[65].

The results are summarized in Table I, which shows the
equilibrium bond lengths re and potential depths Vmin
for alkali-metal dimers and equilateral (D3h) trimers, to-
gether with the corresponding quantities rsp and Vsp for
the linear (D∞h) saddle points. The three-body non-
additive contributions V3 are also given. Fig. 1 shows
the additive and nonadditive potential energy curves for
D3h geometries.

All the trimers show quite strong nonadditive eﬀects.
The quartet trimers all have equilibrium interatomic dis-
tances (at D3h geometries) that are substantially shorter

than those of the triplet dimers, by an amount that de-
creases down the series from 1.07 ˚A in Li3 to 0.59 ˚A in
Cs3. The trimer potentials are all correspondingly deeper
than pairwise sums of dimer potentials, by a factor of 1.3
to 1.5 for the heavier alkali metals (Na to Cs) but a factor
of more than 4 for Li.

The size of the nonadditivity is at ﬁrst sight quite sur-
prising in chemical terms. It contrasts with the situation
for the rare gas trimers, where the non-additive contri-
butions are only 0.5% to 2.5% [66, 67] and produce a
weakening of the binding at equilateral geometries rather
than a strengthening as in Table I.

The interaction potentials can be decomposed into
self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) and correlation contributions.
For the triplet alkali dimers, as for the rare gas dimers,
the SCF potentials are repulsive and the main attrac-
tive forces arise from interatomic correlation (dispersion).
However, this similarity does not extend to the trimers.
For the rare gases, most of the nonadditivity comes from
the dispersion interaction. The leading long-range term

in this is the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) triple-dipole
term [68, 69], which is repulsive near equilateral conﬁg-
urations but attractive near linear conﬁgurations. For
alkali metal atoms, by contrast, there is a large attrac-
tive contribution to the non-additive energy that exists
even at the SCF level. This occurs because the alkali
metals have vacant np orbitals that lie relatively close to
the ns orbitals.

The question then arises why the p orbitals contribute
so strongly for the alkali metal trimers but not the
dimers. Sold´an et al. [47] carried out a natural orbital
analysis for equilateral triangle geometries, and consid-
ered the contribution from radial p orbitals (pointing to-
wards the centre of the triangle) and from tangential p
orbitals (pointing around the ring). The radial p or-
bitals can form bonding and antibonding molecular or-
bitals (MOs) of the same symmetry as those formed from
1 and e′), while the tangential p orbitals
the ns orbitals (a′
can form a′
2 and e′ MOs. The sets of MOs of the same
symmetry interact, lowering the energy of the occupied
MOs and contributing to bonding. Sold´an et al. showed
that the dominant contribution to the trimer bonding is
from the tangential p orbitals. In chemical terms, this
is essentially sp hybridization. This mechanism does not
occur for the alkali metal dimers, because in that case
the “tangential” p orbitals form molecular orbitals of π
symmetry that cannot mix with σ orbitals.

Global potential energy surfaces

It is relatively straightforward to generate potential en-
ergy surfaces for systems such as the quartet alkali metal
trimers by carrying out ab initio electronic structure cal-
culations at grids of points that sample the conﬁgura-
tion space. We have carried out such calculations for Li3
[35, 49] and K3 [51], using RCCSD(T) calculations as de-
scribed above for the linear and equilateral geometries.
Colavecchia et al. [70] have also carried out calculations
for Li3, using a more complete treatment of the valence
electron correlation (full conﬁguration interaction) but
without correlating the core electrons.

A much more diﬃcult problem is to generate a global
potential energy surface from a set of points. For quan-
tum dynamics calculations, it is very important to repre-
sent the potential-energy function smoothly and without
oscillations between ab initio points. If the resulting po-
tential is to be capable of representing all the properties
of experimental interest (including atom-atom scattering
lengths, dimer and trimer bound states, atom-diatom col-
lisions and 3-body recombination), then it is very impor-
tant that the potential should dissociate properly into all
possible sets of products (atom + diatom and 3 separated
atoms) with the correct long-range behaviour.

There are several coordinate systems that can be used
for triatomic systems, including hyperspherical coordi-

5

nates, Jacobi coordinates, and bond-length coordinates.
These are by no means equivalent for interpolation pur-
poses. In particular, grids of points in hyperspherical co-
ordinates tend to include points in which 2 atoms lie very
close together, which hinders interpolation because poly-
nomials with very high localised maxima tend to have
oscillations in other regions. Jacobi coordinates suﬀer
from the same problem, and also do not allow the full
3-body exchange symmetry to be introduced in a natu-
ral way. Fortunately, there is no need to represent the
potential energy surface in the same coordinate system
as is used in the dynamical calculations. We therefore
chose to carry out electronic structure calculations on a
grid of points in bond-length coordinates (r12, r23, r13).
We use the shorthand (r) for this to simplify notation.

In order to represent the atom-diatom dissociation lim-
its correctly, it is essential to use a long-range representa-
tion in which the triatomic potential is decomposed into
a sum of additive and non-additive contributions,

V (r) =

Vdimer(rij ) + V3(r).

(5)

3

Xi<j

Provided V3(r) → 0 when any two of the atom-atom
distances become inﬁnite, this guarantees that the cor-
rect diatomic potential is recovered in the atom-diatom
limit. However, low-energy scattering is very sensitive
to long-range forces, so we also require that the atom-
diatom dispersion coeﬃcients and their anisotropies are
correctly reproduced. This requires careful treatment of
the long-range part of V3(r).

An important point is that, for a pairwise-additive po-
tential in which the dimer potentials have the correct
long-range form −C6R−6, the atom-diatom C6 coeﬃ-
cient is isotropic (independent of Jacobi angle θ). The
anisotropy of the atom-diatom C6 coeﬃcient comes en-
tirely from non-additive forces. Cvitaˇs et al. [52] have
therefore investigated the relationships between 3-body
dispersion coeﬃcients in the atom-diatom and atom-
atom-atom representations and derived formulae relat-
ing the atom-diatom C6 and C8 coeﬃcients and their
anisotropies to three-body coeﬃcients arising from triple-
dipole [68, 69], quadruple-dipole [71, 72] and higher-order
multipole [73, 74] terms.

A variety of representations can be used for interpolat-
ing dimer potentials. We have used the reciprocal-power
reproducing kernel Hilbert space method (RP-RKHS)
[75, 76]. With an appropriate choice of parameters [77],
this gives a potential that has the correct C6 and C8
dispersion coeﬃcients.

At short range, diﬀerent approaches were needed for
K3 and for Li3. K3 is representative of the heavier alkali
metals (Na to Cs) in that the nonadditive potential is
smaller than the potential itself for most conﬁgurations.
It is thus convenient to use Eq. 5 directly with a global
representation of V3(r). The details of the procedure are

The resulting potential energy surfaces for spin-polarized
K3 [51] are shown in Fig. 2. Note that the depth at D3h
geometries is rather more than twice that at linear ge-
ometries, whereas pairwise additivity would give a factor
of 1.5.

Li3 required a diﬀerent procedure, because in this case
the potential minimum for the trimer occurs at a dis-
tance that is high on the repulsive wall for the dimer.
Because of this, Eq. 5 would represent the interaction
potential in this region as a diﬀerence between two very
large quantities. Nevertheless, at long range a decom-
position according to Eq. (5) is essential. Under these
circumstances, it is best to ﬁt the ab initio points di-
rectly to obtain a short-range function VSR(r) without
imposing the correct long-range behaviour. A switching
function S(r) is then used to join this onto the correct
long-range form,

V (r) = S(r)VSR(r) + [1 − S(r)]VLR(r).

(9)

The switching function is 1 at short range but switches
smoothly to zero at long range. The long-range form
VLR(r) is designed to be valid when any of the atom-
atom distances is large, and the procedure used to build
in the correct three-atom and atom-diatom dispersion
coeﬃcients is described in ref. 52.

A further complication arises for Li3 because in this
case there is a second potential energy surface involved.
As described above, the quartet state that correlates with

Conical intersections exist for both symmetrical and
unsymmetrical linear geometries in quartet Li3, but for
strongly unsymmetrical geometries the conical intersec-
tions are high on the repulsive wall and will not af-
fect the dynamics. However, for near-symmetric linear
geometries the seam dips to an energy of about −100
cm−1 (relative to the energy of three free atoms) at
r12 = r23 ≈ 3.1 ˚A. It is thus close to the inner turning
point for low-energy collisions between Li and Li2, and
may have signiﬁcant consequences for the chemical dy-
namics. The conical intersection has subsequently been
characterized in more detail by Brue et al. [78].

QUANTUM DYNAMICS CALCULATIONS

Methodology

As described above, alkali metal atom + diatom colli-
sions require a fully reactive scattering treatment, and at
the energies of interest for cold molecules it is essential
to handle relative translation as well as internal motions
quantum-mechanically. Quantum reactive scattering cal-
culations [79] can in general be performed using either
time-dependent or time-independent treatments.
In re-
cent work at higher energies, time-dependent treatments
based on wavepacket dynamics have been becoming in-
creasingly popular [80]. At ultralow energies, however,
the time evolution of a wavepacket is very slow, and prop-
agating it until it reaches the asymptotic region requires
an impractical number of time steps. Furthermore, it is
diﬃcult to converge wavepacket calculations at very low
scattering energies, because the wave packet needs to be
very broad. We therefore chose to describe ultralow en-
ergy scattering in a time-independent formalism.

There are many variants of time-independent reactive
scattering theory. However, some of them are unsuit-
able for the alkali metal trimers. As described above, the
strong non-additive three-body interactions for the al-
kali metal trimers make the atom-atom distances at the
trimer equilibrium geometry much shorter than those for
the dimers. The vibrational wavefunctions of a free dimer
are centred around its equilibrium bond length and are
very small at the distances that correspond to the trimer
equilibrium. Because of this, the free dimer wavefunc-
tions do not form a good basis set for expanding the
scattering wavefunctions in the region of the trimer equi-
librium, where the actual atom exchange takes place.
This precludes the use of standard reactive scattering
packages such as the ABC program [81], which uses such
basis functions and has been widely used in studies of
reactions such as F+H2 [82, 83, 84] and O(3P)+H2 [85]
at ultralow energies.

We thus chose to use a scattering formalism based on
hyperspherical coordinates ρ, θ, φ [86]: ρ is the hyperra-
dius, which describes the size of the triangle formed by

FIG. 3: Cuts through the Li3 quartet surface in valence co-
ordinates. Upper panel: cut for a bond angle of 170◦, show-

not cross. There are thus conical intersections at linear
geometries, and the avoided crossings produce double-
minimum structures at nonlinear geometries as shown in
the upper panel of Fig. 3. The line of conical intersec-
tions produced a seam in the potential surface as shown
in the lower panel.

the three atoms, while θ and φ are hyperangles, which
describe the shape of the triangle. Hyperspherical ap-
proaches do not use free-diatom functions as a basis set
in the region of the trimer minimum. Instead, they deﬁne
an adiabatic basis set by solving a ﬁxed-ρ Schr¨odinger
equation on a grid of values of the hyperradius ρ. There
are several diﬀerent hyperspherical approaches available.
The approach developed for reactive scattering by Pack
and Parker [87, 88] solves the angular problem using a
ﬁnite-element approach in adiabatically adjusting prin-
cipal axis hyperspherical (APH) coordinates and then
solves the resulting radial coupled equations by propa-
gation. The approach developed by Esry and coworkers
[58, 89] and used extensively for 3-body recombination
in cold gases [58, 59, 60] solves the angular problem in
slightly modiﬁed Smith-Whitten coordinates [86] using
basis splines and then handles the radial problem with
a ﬁnite element approach. Both these methods use an
optimised nonuniform grid in the hyperangles. However,
we chose to use an alternative approach developed by
Launay and LeDourneuf [90], which has been applied ex-
tensively to chemical reactions such as N(2D)+H2 [91]
and O(1D)+H2 [92] at higher energies.

In the approach of Launay and LeDorneuf, the conﬁg-
uration space is divided into inner and outer regions, and
the boundary between them is placed at a distance (hy-
perradius) such that couplings due to the residual atom-
diatom interaction can be neglected outside the bound-
ary. This distance is typically ρ = 45 to 60 a0 for the al-
kali metal systems. In the inner region, the wavefunction
for nuclear motion is obtained by propagating a set of
coupled diﬀerential equations using a diabatic-by-sector
algorithm. The angular basis set is obtained by diag-
onalizing a ﬁxed-hyperradius reference Hamiltonian in
a primitive basis set of pseudohyperspherical harmon-

in a basis set of diatom vibration-rotation functions ex-
pressed in Jacobi coordinates [93]. The wavefunctions
in the outer region are computed by inwards integration
of regular and irregular solutions of an uncoupled radial
Schr¨odinger equation which includes the isotropic part of
the atom-molecule interaction. Matching between wave-
functions for the inner and outer regions yields the scat-
tering S-matrix. Elastic and inelastic cross sections are
then calculated using standard formulae [51].

The size of the basis set required for convergence de-
pends strongly on the masses involved and the depth
of the potential energy well. Before our calculations
on alkali metal systems, nearly all quantum scattering
calculations had been on systems containing only one
or occasionally two non-hydrogen atoms. Calculations
on alkali metal atoms require much bigger angular ba-
sis sets, though fortunately at low energies only a few
partial waves (values of J, the total angular momentum
excluding spin) are needed. Even for Li + Li2 [35], which
is relatively light, the number of adiabatic angular func-

8

tions retained in the coupled equations ranged from 97
for J = 0 to 827 for J = 10, while for K + K2 [51] the
range was from 250 for J = 0 to 1411 for J = 5.

One problem with hyperspherical methods is that the
diatom functions become more localised in hyperangular
space as ρ increases. Because of this, the number of hy-
perspherical harmonics needed for convergence increases
with ρ: for K + K2 it varied from 867 functions at small
ρ to 6625 functions at the matching distance. It is the
calculation to build the adiabatic angular basis that dom-
inates the computer requirements (180 hours on an IBM
Power4 P960 for K + K2).

A major advantage of the hyperspherical harmonics is
that boson or fermion symmetry is very easy to impose.
The complete nuclear permutation group for a system
with three identical nuclei is S3. To satisfy the Pauli
principle, the total wavefunction must have A1 symmetry
for bosonic nuclei or A2 symmetry for fermionic nuclei.
The total wavefunction is in general a sum of products
of electronic, nuclear spin and nuclear motion parts. For
three atoms in their spin-stretched states, the nuclear
spin wavefunction is totally symmetric. For such states,
collisions take place entirely on the quartet surface, for
which the electronic wavefunction has A2 symmetry. Bo-
son or fermion symmetry can thus be imposed by select-
ing pseudohyperspherical harmonics to give the correct
symmetry for the wavefunction for nuclear motion. The
adiabatic states in each sector are obtained by a varia-
tional expansion on a basis of hyperspherical harmonics
with A1 symmetry for bosonic atoms (with fermionic nu-
clei) and A2 symmetry for fermionic atoms (with bosonic
nuclei).

All the calculations were carried out on the quartet
trimer surfaces, so are appropriate for collisions of spin-
polarised atoms and molecules. However, the basis func-
tions used for the quantum dynamics calculations did not
explicitly include electron spin. In a more complete treat-
ment, the rotational quantum number n for the triplet
dimer would couple to its spin s = 1 to give a resultant j.
When spin is neglected, however, there is no distinction
between n and j. The splittings between levels of the
same n but diﬀerent j are in any case very small for the
alkali metal dimers.

Homonuclear molecules

Quantum dynamics calculations have been carried out
for the homonuclear collisions Li + Li2(v = 0 to 3) [35,
49], Na + Na2(v = 0 to 3) [46, 48] and K + K2(v = 1)
[51]. For the Li and K systems, calculations were carried
out for both bosonic and fermionic isotopes.

The results for Li are typical. Figs. 4 and 5 show elastic
and inelastic cross sections for bosons (7Li) and fermions
(6Li) respectively. The elastic and inelastic s-wave cross
sections for 7Li are compared directly and extended to

For a long-range potential proportional to R−6, as for

term that dominates the threshold law for high l so that

It may be seen from Figs. 4 and 5 that below Ekin =

100 µK the cross sections are completely dominated by
the l = 0 term, which corresponds to total angular mo-
mentum J = 0 for bosons but J = 1 for fermions (be-
cause J = l + j and the lowest rotational level of a triplet
fermion dimer is j = 1). The energy-dependence of the
inelastic rate coeﬃcient is kσinel where k = (2Ekin/µ)1/2,
so that the inelastic rate is independent of energy in this
region.

Above Ekin = 100 µK, the l = 0 contribution starts to
deviate from the Wigner limit and higher partial waves
start to contribute. The point at which this happens
depends somewhat on mass, and is closer to 10 µK for K
+ K2 [51].

that fermion dimers produced by Feshbach resonance

tuning are very much stabler than boson dimers when
the scattering length is large. This stability was cru-
cial in the production of molecular Bose-Einstein con-
densates of 6Li2 [8, 9] and 40K2 [10]. Petrov et al. [33]
explained the stability in terms of the requirements of
Fermi-Dirac statistics. However, their derivation is valid
only for long-range molecular states. A very important
question is whether the stability persists for low-lying vi-
brational states of fermion dimers.

Cvitaˇs et al. [35] carried out quantum dynamics calcu-
lations for spin-polarized collisions of ultracold homonu-
clear Li + Li2 collisions for both the bosonic (7Li) and
fermionic (6Li) cases. The results shown in Figs. 4 and
5 correspond to vibrational quenching rates for v = 1 of
kinel = 5.6 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 for bosons and 2.8 × 10−10
cm3 s−1 for fermions. However, the apparent diﬀerence
of a factor of 2 is not signiﬁcant: there were diﬀerences
of up to a factor of 8 between inelastic cross sections for
diﬀerent initial values of v and j. Cvitaˇs et al. found no
systematic diﬀerence between inelastic rates in the boson
and fermion cases, even when the atom-atom scattering
length was adjusted to be large and positive. This has
important consequences for eﬀorts to transfer the dimer
population from Feshbach resonance states to the vibra-
tional ground state, v = 0: it will be necessary to carry
out the process either in a single step or quickly enough
that the molecules do not spend enough time in interme-
diate states to undergo inelastic collisions.

The resulting barrier heights are included in Figs. 4
and 5. The ﬁrst vertical line corresponds to the l = 1
partial wave and so on up to the l = 7 partial wave. It
may be seen that each partial cross section has a maxi-
mum at an energy slightly higher than the corresponding
V l
max. At collision energies below the centrifugal barrier,
the partial cross sections for each l follow Wigner laws
given by Eq. (10). Above the centrifugal barrier, the in-
elastic probabilities come close to their maximum value
of 1 and the cross sections vary as E−1 because of the
k−2 factor in the expression for the cross section.

Capture model outside the ultracold regime

At high collision energy, when several partial waves are
involved, the total inelastic rate coeﬃcient can be com-
pared with that given by the classical Langevin capture
model [95], based on the idea that every collision that
crosses the centrifugal barrier produces inelasticity. This

This rate coeﬃcient is shown as a function of collision
energy for Li + Li2 in Fig. 7 and compared with the
quenching rates for bosons and fermions initially in v = 1
and 2 [35]. It may be seen that the full quantum result
approaches the Langevin value at collision energies above
about 10 mK. Similar behaviour is seen for K + K2 at
collision energies above 0.1 mK [51].

Product rotational distributions

The vibrational spacings of the alkali metal dimers are
much larger than their rotational spacings, so that many
rotational levels are energetically accessible in collisions
that cause vibrational relaxation. For Na2, for example,
rotational levels up to j = 20 are energetically accessi-
ble at the energy of the v = 1 state (23.5 cm−1). All
accessible levels are populated in the products, subject

to symmetry restrictions (only even-j levels for bosons
and odd-j levels for fermions). The product rotational
distributions for Na + Na2 (v = 1) at 10−4 K are shown
in Fig. 8. There are three clear maxima in the distribu-
tion, at j = 4, 12 and 18. The oscillations probably arise
from a rotational rainbow eﬀect [96, 97]. The structure
is similar to that observed in vibrational predissociation
of Van der Waals complexes [98]. In a classical impulsive
model, the energy released from Na2 vibration is partly
retained in relative translation and partly converted into
Na2 rotation. The angular momentum imparted to the
Na2 molecule is zero if the energy is released at a linear
or T-shaped geometry, but large around θ = 45◦. In this
model, the oscillations arise from interference between
classical trajectories on either side of the maximum.

The rotational distributions become constant at low
energies but show structure above 10−4 K. This is shown
for K + K2 (v = 1) in Fig. 9. In this case levels up to
j = 24 are energetically accessible. Once again there is an
oscillatory structure in the product state distributions.

Potential sensitivity

The sensitivity of the cross sections to details of the
potential energy surface is of great importance. Sold´an
et al. [46] showed that including the nonadditive part of
the interaction potential changed both elastic and inelas-
tic cross sections for Na + Na2 (v = 1) by more than
a factor of 10. Qu´em´ener et al. [48] investigated this in
more detail: they introduced a scaling factor λ to multi-
ply the nonadditive term, so that λ = 0 corresponds to
a pairwise-additive potential and λ = 1 to the full non-
additive potential. They then investigated cross sections

as a function of λ for initial v = 1, 2 and 3. They found
that elastic and inelastic cross sections varied by a factor
of 10 for v = 1 for variations of λ as small as 0.01 either
side of λ = 1. However, the variations became consid-
erably smaller for v = 2 and 3. Cvitaˇs et al. [49] have
investigated similar eﬀects for Li + Li2 at rather higher
energy resolution. For v = 0, the elastic cross sections
show very sharp structure as a function of λ as shown
in Fig. 10, caused by poles in the scattering length each
time there is a bound state at zero energy. However, the
structure for v > 0 is weaker for both elastic and inelas-

tic cross sections as shown in Fig. 11. This is due to a
general eﬀect discussed by Hutson [99]: in the presence
of inelastic scattering, the poles in scattering lengths at
the positions of zero-energy resonances are suppressed,
and the suppression increases with the degree of inelastic
scattering.

Diﬀerential cross sections

At very low energies, cross sections are completely
dominated by the l = 0 partial wave. Under these cir-
cumstances, the scattering is completely isotropic and
the diﬀerential cross sections are featureless. However,
as the energy increases and higher partial waves start to
contribute, angular structure appears. Low-energy scat-
tering thus oﬀers the opportunity to study the onset of
angular behaviour in reactive cross sections. The way
that the angular behaviour develops is shown for K +
K2 (v = 1) in Fig. 12. At 1 µK the scattering is com-
pletely isotropic, but for 100 µK some angular structure
arising from interference between l = 0 and 1 is evident.
At 0.1 mK partial waves up to l = 5 contribute and sev-
eral peaks emerge.

Heteronuclear molecules

Heteronuclear molecules are particularly interesting
because they oﬀer the possibility of studying reactive
collisions separately from inelastic collisions. Homonu-
clear molecules that are formed in their lowest vibration-
rotation state are stable to collisions. For heteronuclear

molecules, however, the situation is more complicated.
Even molecules in their ground rovibrational states may
not be stable against collisions. For example, the spin-
polarized reaction

6Li7Li(v = 0, j = 0) + 7Li → 6Li + 7Li2(v = 0, j = 0)

(15)
is exothermic by 1.822 K because of the diﬀerence be-
tween the zero-point energies of the two dimers. How-
ever, the process

6Li7Li(v = 0, j = 0) + 6Li → 7Li + 6Li2(v = 0, j = 1)

(16)
cannot occur at collision energies below 2.643 K because
of the combined eﬀects of zero-point energy and the need
to form 6Li2 in j = 1 or higher to satisfy fermion sym-
metry requirements.

Cvitaˇs et al. [50] have investigated the process (15) and
the resulting elastic and reactive cross-sections are shown
in Fig. 13. It may be seen that the reactive scattering
dominates over elastic scattering below 10 µK. The low-
temperature reactive rate coeﬃcient is only 4.7 × 10−12
cm3 s−1, which is reduced by a factor of about 50 from
those typical for vibrational relaxation in the homonu-
clear case. Cvitaˇs et al. attributed the diﬀerence to the
fact that there is only a single open channel for reaction
(15).

13

The results obtained in Ref. 50 have important impli-
cations. There is interest in producing a quantum gas of
6Li7Li in its ground rovibronic state in an ultracold mix-
ture of 6Li and 7Li atoms. In order to stabilize the molec-
ular cloud against two-body trap losses induced by the re-
active process (15), the remaining atomic 7Li would have
to be removed quickly after ground-state molecule pro-
duction, so that just the two-species fermionic mixture
of 6Li7Li(v = 0, j = 0) molecules and 6Li atoms is left in
the trap. The 6Li cloud could be removed as well, but
it might be advantageous to keep it in the trap. Elastic
s-wave collisions between fermionic 6Li7Li molecules will
be strongly suppressed, but low-energy collisions with 6Li
can result only in elastic scattering and might be used to
achieve sympathetic cooling of the molecules.

Further extensions

Our work on the quantum dynamics of collisions of
alkali metal dimers has so far been restricted in several
ways. We have focussed on collisions of molecules in low
vibrational states, for systems involving three chemically
equivalent atoms. We have restricted ourselves to col-
lisions of spin-stretched atoms and molecules, for which
doublet electronic states do not contribute. We have ne-
glected hyperﬁne structure, and worked in zero applied
ﬁeld.

Extending the calculations to handle heteronuclear
systems is relatively straightforward, though a consid-
erable amount of work is needed to develop potential
energy surfaces for each system of interest. Dynamical
calculations are more expensive for heavier atoms and
for systems of lower symmetry (and the calculations de-
scribed here already push the limits of current comput-
ers). Extending the calculations to higher vibrational
states is also mostly a matter of computer time, though
true long-range states very near dissociation may be diﬃ-
cult or impossible to converge with our current scattering
methods.

Including the eﬀects of nuclear spin and magnetic ﬁelds
is a very diﬃcult task, though an important one if we are
to explore atom-molecule Feshbach resonances and use
them to control molecular interactions in the same way
as atomic interactions. Collisions of atoms and molecules
in non-spin-stretched states will be particularly challeng-
ing, because they will involve doublet surfaces as well as
quartet surfaces, and for alkali metal trimers the dou-
blet surfaces exhibit conical intersections and geometric
phase eﬀects [100, 101] that considerably complicate the
dynamics.

CONCLUSIONS

[7] T. K¨ohler, K. Goral, and P. S. Julienne, Rev. Mod.

This article focussed on theoretical studies of collisions
between spin-polarized alkali metal dimers and atoms,
which are crucial in experiments designed to form ultra-
cold molecules in low-lying vibrational states. Colliding
dimers can undergo very fast barrierless chemical reac-
tions. As a result, vibrationally excited molecules un-
dergo very fast vibrational relaxation, with rates usu-
ally in excess of kinel = 10−10 cm3 s−1. At temper-
atures above about 1 mK, where several partial waves
contribute, the rates are approximately given by a sta-
tistical Langevin capture model. At lower temperatures,
however, the reactions enter a regime governed by Wigner
threshold laws and a full quantum-dynamical treatment
is essential to calculate the rates. In this regime the re-
sults are very sensitive to details of the triatomic po-
tential energy surfaces, though the sensitivity decreases
for excited vibrational levels. Isotopically heteronuclear
molecules can often undergo exothermic reactions even
from their ground vibrational states, because of the dif-
ference in zero-point energy between reactants and prod-
ucts.

Prospects for the future include the production of
quantum-degenerate gases of ground-state molecules,
which will be stable to collisions and oﬀer a wealth of
new possibilities for quantum control. Heteronuclear
molecules are particularly interesting, because they can
have substantial dipole moments in long-range states.
Dipolar quantum gases oﬀer a new range of novel prop-
erties, and ultracold polar molecules also have potential
applications in quantum computing and in studying fun-
damental physical properties such as parity violation and
the electron dipole moment.

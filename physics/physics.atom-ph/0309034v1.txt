We report the ﬁrst eﬃcient trapping of rare-earth Yb atoms with a high-power violet laser diode
(LD). An injection-locked violet LD with a 25 mW frequency-stabilized output was used for the
magneto-optical trapping (MOT) of fermionic as well as bosonic Yb isotopes. A typical number
of 4 × 106 atoms for 174Yb with a trap density of ∼ 1 × 108/cm3 was obtained. A 10 mW violet
external-cavity LD (ECLD) was used for the one-dimensional (1D) slowing of an eﬀusive Yb atomic
beam without a Zeeman slower resulting in a 35-fold increase in the number of trapped atoms. The
overall characteristics of our compact violet MOT, e.g., the loss time of 1 s, the loading time of 400
ms, and the cloud temperature of 0.7 mK, are comparable to those in previously reported violet Yb
MOTs, yet with a greatly reduced cost and complexity of the experiment.

Atomic rare-earth ytterbium (Yb) has been proposed
as one of the ideal neutral atomic systems for a future op-
tical frequency standard [1] due to its unique energy level
structure that is very similar to the alkali-earth counter-
parts, Ca [2, 3], Sr [4], and Mg [5], which have a strong
closed dipole-allowed transition for laser manipulation
along with a narrow intercombination transition for opti-
cal clock excitation. Recently, Katori proposed a unique
approach to develop an optical frequency standard based
on the 1S0−3P0 doubly forbidden intercombination tran-
sition in the 87Sr fermionic isotope [6]. In the proposal,
cold fermions are trapped within the Lamb-Dicke region
in a Stark shift-free optical trap [7], which is believed
to be an ideal cold atomic system for a long interroga-
tion time without residual Doppler shift, thus providing
a low systematic uncertainty comparable to the single-
ion-based optical frequency standard [8]. To realize this
proposal, a recoil-limited laser cooling of 87Sr atoms near
the Fermi temperature in an optical lattice and a recoil-
free spectroscopy of neutral Sr atoms in the Lamb-dicke
regime have been demonstrated [9, 10]. Quite recently,
Courtillot et. al. successfully detected the weak 1S0−3P0
transition in a conventional 87Sr MOT and measured the
absolute frequency of the transition with a femtosecond
comb [11].

In the Yb atomic system, there are two stable fermionic
isotopes, i.e., 171Yb (I = 1/2) and 173Yb (I = 5/2), where
I is the nuclear spin. We believe that for the fermionic
Yb isotopes, Katori’s proposal could equally be appli-
cable for both fermions and even 171Yb may compete
with 87Sr for the future optical frequency standard due
to its simple magnetic sub-level structure. For this ap-
plication, eﬃcient 1D slowing and trapping of Yb atoms
using a resonant 1S0−1P1 transition at 398.9 nm can be
the starting point of the whole road to an Yb optical

clock. Recently, high-density trapping and the ﬁrst Bose-
Einstein condensation of Yb atoms by an optical dipole
trap loaded from an intercombination MOT (555.8 nm)
[12, 13] and sub-Doppler cooling eﬀects of the Fermionic
Yb atoms [14] have been reported. We can expect other
interesting applications using the trapped Yb atoms, if
one can build a compact violet laser system at 399 nm
which can be used for the eﬃcient 1D slowing and ﬁrst-
stage violet MOT [15, 16, 17] as demonstrated in this
study. Usually, a frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser is
used for that purpose, but the system is complex and ex-
pensive; therefore a study of a compact yet inexpensive
violet LD system for the eﬃcient trapping of Yb atoms
would be of importance for future applications.

With the recent developments of violet LD technolo-
gies, a high-power (30 mW) violet LD is now commer-
cially available. Based on this high-power violet LD,
we have reported previously a frequency-stabilized, high-
power, violet LD system for the manipulation of Yb
atoms [18, 19]. In this paper, we describe the ﬁrst demon-
stration of an eﬃcient Yb trapping experiment in a con-
ventional MOT by using the violet LD system. The per-
formance characteristics of our compact violet MOT, for
example the trapped atom number of diﬀerent isotopes,
are found to be similar to those of the previously reported
Yb MOT by using a frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser
[20], yet with a greatly reduced cost and complexity of
the experiment.
In addition, for a future optical clock
studies, we have successfully trapped 1.4 ×106 fermionic
171Yb atoms with a temperature of 0.7 mK, which is very
close to the Doppler limit of 670 µK.

Figure 1 shows the layout of our experimental setup for
the eﬃcient trapping of Yb from an atomic beam eﬀusing
from an oven, but without a Zeeman slower. The exper-
iments were done inside an ultra-high vacuum chamber
consisting of a commercial stainless octagon. The oc-
tagon was pumped by two 45 l/s ion pumps and main-
tained at a pressure of 4 × 10−10 torr without Yb atoms
and 6 × 10−9 torr with the Yb atomic beam at the oven

temperature of 390oC. The trapping laser beam from
the slave laser (described below) was divided into two
beams by a beam splitter for the horizontal axis (X and
Y axis) and the vertical axis (Z axis). The horizontal
beam was retro-reﬂected in the X-Y plane, while the ver-
tical beam was retro-reﬂected in the Z-axis, to form a
three-dimensional σ+-σ− trapping geometry. Since the
intensities I of the two trapping beams were only 5.0
mW/cm2 just before the widows of the octagon, the sat-
uration parameter s was very small, i.e., s = I/Is =
0.09, where Is = 2π¯hωΓ/6λ2 = 58 mW/cm2 is the sat-
uration intensity, Γ = 2π× 28 MHz (excited-state decay
rate), ω = 2πc/λ, c is the velocity of light, and λ is the
wavelength of the trapping laser. Therefore, we attached
the oven close to the octagon (8 cm apart) to increase
the atomic ﬂux and used a 1D slowing laser to increase
the number of low velocity atoms below the capture ve-
locity vc ≈ 15 m/s of the violet MOT [3]. At 390oC
the fraction of Yb atoms under vc is estimated to be
3.5 × 10−6. And by assuming the ﬂux of Yb atoms from
the oven is 1011 ∼ 1012/s for our trap geometry (noz-
zle diameter of 1.5 mm and 20 cm distance between the
oven exit and the trap center) [16], we could roughly
estimate the ﬂux of Yb atoms slower than vc by using
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, namely the load-
ing rate of 104 ∼ 105/s without any 1D slowing process.
Therefore, the use of a 1D slowing laser is essential for the
eﬃcient trapping of Yb atoms. In addition, to maintain a
steep magnetic-ﬁeld gradient and an ultra-high vacuum
in the octagon, we designed a compact anti-Helmholtz
coil installed outside the octagon with coils separated by
only 4 cm. In the experiment, we found an optimal value
of ∂B/∂z =45 G/cm at the coil current of 3.5 A and the
trapping laser detuning of -0.5Γ.

To build a trapping laser at 398.9 nm, we developed
a high-power violet LD system employing the injection
locking technique. Details of the master+slave violet
laser system were previously reported in [19], and here we
only brieﬂy describe the system. The violet LDs used for
the master ECLD and the slave laser are high-power vio-
let LDs with a 30 mW output power. The master ECLD
has a Littrow geometry in external feed-back and has an
output power of more than 15 mW [18]. The frequency of
the master ECLD could be locked to any of the dispersion
slopes of the Doppler-free absorption signals correspond-
ing to the six stable Yb isotopes, i.e., isotopes 170, 171-
174, and 176, obtained in the Yb saturation spectrometer
(Yb SAS Lock). The Yb SAS consisted of a Yb hollow-
cathode lamp (HCL) with Ne buﬀer gas. However, we
could not resolve the closely positioned absorption lines
corresponding to the two hyperﬁne transitions of the
173Yb (1S0(F=3/2) to 1P1(F′=3/2) and 1P1(F′=7/2))
and 172Yb isotopes [19]. Since the Doppler-free width of
60 MHz is more than two times wider than the natural
linewidth of the 1P1 excited state, we were easily able to
tune the frequency of the master laser to the optimal red
detuning of -0.5 Γ with an electronic servo system [19].
We have estimated the frequency stability of the master

2

ECLD from the measurement of Allan variance of its er-
ror signal and obtained a frequency stability of 62 kHz
at a 1 s average time. Consequently, with a 0.6 mW in-
jection power, the stabilized output of the master laser
increased coherently up to 25 mW with the slave laser.
The beat-note linewidth at 160 MHz between the master
and slave lasers was measured to be below 1 Hz, indi-
cating a good injection locking quality with a stability of
2.5 × 10−7 at a 1 s average time [19].

A violet ECLD for the 1D slowing (ECLD2) was also
constructed with the same high-power violet laser diode.
The frequency of the 1D slowing laser was stabilized to
the broad Doppler-limited absorption signal having a 2
GHz wide linewidth obtained with the modulation-free
DAVLL (dichroic-atomic-vapor laser lock) technique (Yb
DAVLL Lock) [18]. Due to its broad spectrum associated
with the six Yb isotopes, we were easily able to ﬁnd the
optimal detuning of the 1D slowing laser for a speciﬁc
isotope by changing electronically the reference voltage
of the locking signal. A 10 mW output of the ECLD2 was
focused through a side window of the vacuum chamber
as shown in Fig. 1 to the exit of the oven collimator
(not shown) [3] to maximally overlap the 1D slowing laser
with the atomic beam at the center of the violet MOT,
taking into account the atomic beam divergence. With
this focused 1D slowing laser, we achieved an increased
acceleration and power broadening simultaneously along
the direction toward the exit of the oven, which resulted
in an increase of the total number of 1D slowed atoms in
the trap site by as large as 35 times than without the 1D
slowing laser.

Individual Yb isotopes could be sequentially loaded
into the violet MOT by changing the locking point of
the trapping laser to correspond to a detuning of −0.5Γ
and slowly scanning the 1D slowing laser frequency across
the 1S0-1P1 resonance. As a result, we were able to trap
almost all of the stable Yb isotopes. Figure 2 shows
the ﬂuorescence intensities for diﬀerent Yb isotopes as
a function of the detuning of the 1D slowing laser from
the frequency of the trapping laser. We found that the
optimal detunings of the 1D slowing laser were about -90
MHz (∼ −3.2Γ) for the bosonic isotopes, and -80 MHz
(∼ −2.9Γ) for the fermionic 171Yb isotope. The diﬀer-
ence of the optimal detuning of the 1D slowing laser in
the fermionic isotope could be understood as resulting
from optical pumping between the hyperﬁne sub-levels
present because of the non-zero nuclear spin. Note that
the detuning of the 1D slowing laser in our experiment
is relatively close to the line center compared to the ex-
periments using a Zeeman slower [15, 16].

We measured the average cloud diameter of 2.5 mm
(FWHM) by imaging the violet MOT onto the image
plane of the collection lens (see Fig. 1) to measure the
density of trapped atoms. Fluorescence intensity from
the MOT was easily measured with either a power-meter
or a photomultiplier (PM) tube located at the image
plane of the trapped Yb cloud, enabling us to calibrate
and calculate the trapped atom numbers taking into ac-

count the solid angle of the imaging lens and the scatter-
ing rate of the 1S0-1P1 transition. The maximum trapped
atom number and density of the most abundant 174Yb
isotope were about 4 × 106 and 1 × 108/cm3, respectively.
The vertical axis in the right-hand-side of Fig. 2 indicates
the calibrated trapped atom number. Table I summarizes
the maximum trapped atom numbers and natural abun-
dances for diﬀerent Yb isotopes. Note that the trapped
atom numbers listed in Table I are just a half smaller
than those in [17, 20], where no 1D slowing laser was
used but a high-power (80∼90 mW, s = 0.5 ∼ 0.6/axis)
frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser for trapping was em-
ployed, demonstrating the high eﬃciency of the violet LD
trapping of Yb atoms with a 1D slowing laser. Further-
more, this result can also be explained with the earlier
observation of the power dependent loss mechanism in
ref.
[16]. The higher intensity of the trapping laser in-
creases the excited-state population ρ22 and subsequently
increases the population loss in the Yb MOT through a
weak branching via the 3D1 and 3D2 states to the 3P2
and 3P0 metastable states resulting in the saturation of
the total trapped atom numbers at the low-level intensity
(s < 1) of the trapping laser.

The ﬂuorescence intensity ratios between the even iso-
topes (172, 174, and 176) were very similar to the natural
abundance ratios between them [15, 20]. However, for the
fermionic 171Yb isotope the trapping eﬃciency was 50%
smaller than those of the even isotopes [15, 20]. In Fig. 2,
we omitted the ﬂuorescence intensity corresponding to
the fermionic 173Yb isotope, since we could not observe a
conﬁned atomic cloud, rather we were just able to detect
the ﬂuorescence from the optical molasses state. This
fact can be understood because the 1P1 (F′=7/2) hyper-
ﬁne state of 173Yb lies too close to the 1P1 (F′ =3/2) state
(84 MHz apart), and thus optical pumping to the mag-
netic sub-levels in the 1S0 (F=5/2) ground state disturbs
the cyclic cooling process [15]. In addition, in this level
conﬁguration the trapping beam is always blue-detuned
from for the 1P1 (F′ =3/2) state, producing an opposite
force relative to the trapping force by the 1P1 (F′=7/2)
cycling transition due to the opposite sign of the Land´e
g-factors. This problem could be solved by using the
second-stage intercombination trapping transition at 555
nm demonstrated in [15], where the excited hyperﬁne
intervals of the three 3P1 hyperﬁne states of the 173Yb
isotope are well separated (> 1.5 GHz). The hyperﬁne
splitting of the excited state of 171Yb, however, is 319
MHz wide, therefore there is no optical pumping eﬀect in
the 171Yb isotope. As shown in Fig. 2, we have trapped
1.4×106 171Yb atoms with high eﬃciency (35% of the
most abundant 174Yb isotopes) which is slightly lower
than the result in [20], close to the natural abundance
ratio of 45% between them (see Table I). Consequently,
we expect that in future studies of optical clocks based
on the fermionic 171Yb isotope, the violet LDs will be
very useful for the the preparation of the cold trapped
171Yb atomic samples.

To characterize the violet MOT further, we have mea-

3

sured the cloud temperature, the loading time TL, and
the decay time TD of the MOT by using the well-
known release-and-recapture method. The bottom trace
in Fig. 3 shows the typical experimental data for the load-
ing time and decay time measurements of the 174Yb iso-
tope. Upper traces in Fig. 3 show the chopping time
sequences of the trapping and 1D slowing lasers for two
mechanical shutters installed in front of the slave laser
and ECLD2 in Fig. 1. After loading the MOT with the
trapping laser only, we suddenly turned on the 1D slow-
ing laser at T = 2.7 s, as shown in Fig. 3, to see the
increase of ﬂuorescence intensity with the help of the 1D
slowing laser. From the exponential ﬁt to the data, we
could obtain the loading time of TL = 370 ms. As one can
see from Fig. 3, the use of the 1D slowing laser increased
the trapped atom number by about 35 times more than
that obtained with the trapping laser only. After the
steady state was reached, we abruptly turned oﬀ both
lasers at T = 6.7 s to let the atomic cloud freely ex-
pand, and 10 ms later we turned on the trapping laser
again, thereby re-capturing the atoms by the trapping
laser only. Then, the ﬂuorescence intensity decays with
the same decay rate of the MOT until the steady-state
reached. From the exponential ﬁt to this decay curve, we
obtained the decay time of TD = 1.0 s. We repeated the
measurement for the diﬀerent Yb isotopes and listed the
measurement results in Table I. The diﬀerence between
the loading rate and decay rate in Fig. 3 and Table I is
caused by the fact that the detuning of our 1D slowing
laser is only 3Γ from the line center and there is a 1D ra-
diation pressure which increases the loss rate of the violet
MOT when the 1D slowing laser is turned on.

Since we know the size of the trapping beam (1 cm),
we can estimate the cloud temperature by measuring the
ﬂuorescence intensity ratio R before and after the 10 ms
interval at T = 6.7 s in Fig. 3.
If we assume a three-
dimensional isotropic Boltzmann velocity distribution at
the given temperature T, and calculate the time evolu-
tion of the distribution after 10 ms taking into account
the increased cloud size, then it is straightforward to ob-
tain the ratio between the number of atoms within the
size of the trapping laser beam to the total number of ini-
tially trapped atoms. This ratio should be directly pro-
portional to the ﬂuorescence intensity ratio depending on
the initial cloud temperature as measured in Fig. 3, i.e.,
R = 0.57 for 174Yb. By adjusting the initial temperature
of the trapped atoms in a ﬁtting program until the calcu-
lated ratio of the atomic numbers agrees with the mea-
sured ratio R of the ﬂuorescence intensities, we can deter-
mine the temperature of the trapped atoms. Table I also
shows the measured ﬂuorescence intensity ratio (recap-
ture ratio) R and the cloud temperature of the diﬀerent
Yb isotopes. We found that the cloud temperatures for
most Yb isotopes were slightly above the Doppler limit of
670 µK as can be seen in Table I. The relatively low tem-
perature of the trapped Yb atoms observed resulted from
the low saturation parameter (s = 0.09) of the violet LD
trapping laser. However, the focused 1D slowing laser in-

creased the total number of trapped atoms, comparable
to the results in [15] and [20].

In summary, we have eﬃciently cooled and trapped
the rare-earth Yb atoms in a compact violet magneto-
optical trap employing a high-power frequency-stabilized
violet LD system without a Zeeman slower. The over-
all characteristics of our compact violet Yb MOT are
found to be similar to those of the previously reported
Yb MOTs using a frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser
and a Zeeman slower, yet with greatly reduced cost and
complexity. Importantly, for future optical clock studies,
we have successfully trapped 1.4 ×106 fermionic 171Yb
atoms with a temperature of 0.7 mK, which is very close

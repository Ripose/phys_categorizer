Abstract

Precision comparisons of diﬀerent atomic frequency standards over a period of a
few years can be used for a sensitive search for temporal variations of fundamental
constants. We present recent frequency measurements of the 688 THz transition in
the 171Yb+ ion. For this transition frequency a record over six years is now available,
showing that a possible frequency drift relative to a cesium clock can be constrained to
−15 per year. Combined with precision
(−0.54 ± 0.97) Hz/yr, i.e. at the level of 2 · 10
frequency measurements of an optical frequency in 199Hg+ and of the hyperﬁne ground
state splitting in 87Rb a stringent limit on temporal variations of the ﬁne structure
−1 and a model-dependent limit for
constant α: d ln α/dt = (−0.26 ± 0.39) · 10
variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio µ in the present epoch can be derived:
d ln µ/dt = (−1.2 ± 2.2) · 10−15 yr−1. We discuss these results in the context of astro-
physical observations that apparently indicate changes in both of these constants over
the last 5–10 billion years.

1. Search for variations of constants in astrophysics and with atomic clocks

Over the past few years there has been great interest in the possibility that the funda-
mental constants of nature might show temporal variations over cosmological time scales
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Such an eﬀect – as incompatible as it seems with the present foundations of
physics – appears quite naturally in the attempt to ﬁnd a uniﬁed theory of the fundamental
interactions. An active search for an indication of variable constants is pursued mainly in
two areas: observational astrophysics and laboratory experiments with atomic frequency
standards. The two most important quantities under test are Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure
constant α = e2/(4πǫ0¯hc) and the proton-to-electron mass ratio µ = mp/me. While α is the
coupling constant of the electromagnetic interaction, µ also depends on the strength of the
strong force and on the quark masses via the proton mass. It is important that these quan-
tities are dimensionless numbers so that results can be interpreted independently from the
conventions of a speciﬁc system of units. Quite conveniently, both constants appear promi-
nently in atomic and molecular transition energies: α in atomic ﬁne structure splittings and
other relativistic contributions, and µ in molecular vibration and rotation frequencies as well
as in hyperﬁne structure.

A multitude of data on variations of α and µ has been obtained from astrophysical
observations but the present picture that is obtained is not completely consistent: Evidence
for a variation of α has been derived from a shift of wavelengths of metal ion absorption
lines produced by interstellar clouds in the light from distant quasars [6]. These observations
suggest that about 10 billion years ago (redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.5), the value of α was

1

smaller than today by ∆α/α = (−0.543 ± 0.116) · 10−5, representing 4.7σ evidence for a
varying α [7].
(Here the deﬁnition is used that a negative sign of ∆α corresponds to a
temporal increase of the constant.) Assuming a linear increase of α with time, this would
correspond to a drift rate d ln α/dt = (6.40 ± 1.35) · 10−16 yr−1 [7]. Other evaluations of
spectra obtained with a diﬀerent telescope and using other selections of quasar absorption
systems reach similar or even higher sensitivity for ∆α/α but are consistent with ∆α = 0
for all look-back times [8, 9].

In the case of the proton-to-electron mass ratio a relative change ∆µ/µ = (2.4±0.6)·10−5
has been inferred from the analysis of absorption systems of H2 clouds at redshifts z = 2.6
and 3.0 (look-back time ≈ 12 Gyr), observed in the spectra of two quasars [10]. Assuming a
linear time evolution, this would correspond to d ln µ/dt ≈ −2 · 10−15 yr−1. Looking only at
the positive reports about variations, one would conclude |∆µ/µ| > |∆α/α|. Indeed, in the
framework of theories of uniﬁcation it is plausible that the scale of the strong interaction
shows a bigger rate of change than the electromagnetic force [11, 12, 13].

Other recent reports derive stringent limits on variations: an analysis of 18 cm OH lines
at red shift z = 0.765 (look-back time 6.7 billion years) constrains the variation of the
quantity F ≡ gp(α2µ)1.57 (gp: g-factor of the proton) to ∆F/F = (0.44 ± 1.07) · 10−5 [14].
A combination of the H ground state hyperﬁne splitting interval (21 cm line) and metal
ion absorption lines in quasar spectra can be used to test the constancy of the parameter
X ≡ α2gp/µ and a result ∆X/X = (1.17 ± 1.01) · 10−5 has been obtained for the redshift
range 0.2 < z < 2.0.[15] Combined with either the non-zero [7] or the zero [9] value for ∆α/α
one obtains ∆µ/µ = (2.31 ± 1.03) · 10−5 or ∆µ/µ = (1.29 ± 1.01) · 10−5, respectively. It
should be kept in mind that the uncertainties cited here are usually the result of averaging
over a large ensemble of data points with much higher individual statistical uncertainties.
The signiﬁcance of the results that detect non-zero variations therefore hinges on a complete
understanding of all systematic eﬀects that may introduce bias or correlations in the data
and that may not be easy to detect.

The approach of using precision laboratory experiments with frequency standards to
search for variations of the fundamental constants [16] has the advantage that the relevant
parameters are under the control of the experimenter, permitting a detailed investigation
of possible systematic eﬀects. The obvious disadvantage is that the limited duration of the
experiments of typically a few years only is not well adapted to search for evolution on a
cosmological time scale. Application of the methods of laser cooling and trapping has led to
signiﬁcant improvements in the precision of atomic clocks and frequency standards over the
last years [17, 18]: Primary cesium clocks based on atomic fountains [19, 20] realize the SI
second with a relative uncertainty below 1 · 10−15 and a similar level of accuracy has been
achieved for the ground state hyperﬁne frequency of 87Rb [20]. Research towards optical
clocks with trapped ions and atoms [21, 18] has resulted in several systems that approach
the accuracy of primary cesium clocks or show an even higher reproducibility. In typical
experiments performed so far to search for temporal changes of fundamental constants,
the
an atomic transition frequency fat is measured with respect to a cesium clock (i.e.
frequency ratio fat/fCs is determined, where fCs ≡ 9 192 631 770 Hz, the SI value of the
ground state hyperﬁne splitting frequency of 133Cs). One measurement usually takes a few
days of averaging time in order to reach a low statistical uncertainty. After a few years the
measurement is repeated and changes in the frequency ratio can be looked for.

This procedure has recently been undertaken for: the ground state hyperﬁne frequency
of 87Rb [22, 20], the 1S → 2S two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen [23], the transition
2S1/2 → 2D5/2 at 1065 THz in Hg+ [24, 25], and the 2S1/2 → 2D3/2 transition at 688 THz
in 171Yb+ (this work). Signiﬁcant changes of α or µ would produce a clear signature in

2

these experiments, because they would inﬂuence the transition frequencies diﬀerently [4, 26].
Atomic gross structure scales with the Rydberg constant R∞, hyperﬁne structure with the
product of α2R∞ and the nuclear magnetic moment. In addition, the ﬁne structure constant
α appears in relativistic contributions to the level energies that increase with the square of
the nuclear charge and are consequently much more important for heavy atoms [27]. The
sensitivity of a speciﬁc transition frequency to changes of α can be derived from ab initio
relativistic atomic structure calculations [28, 29]. While measurements on a single atomic
gross structure transition relative to a cesium clock can test variations of a combination
of α and the cesium magnetic moment only, a combination of data from diﬀerent optical
transition frequencies can be used to obtain a model-independent result about variations
of α alone [4, 23, 30]. The published most stringent laboratory limit on variations of the
ﬁne structure constant in the present epoch had been obtained by this method in 2004:
d ln α/dt = (−0.3 ± 2.0) · 10−15 yr−1 [30], using the three optical transitions mentioned
above.

Contrary to the astrophysical observations, all present laboratory experiments are com-
patible with constancy of constants to within 1σ. The question arises to which degree the
results of the quasar absorption spectra and the laboratory experiments can be interrelated,
because they investigate very diﬀerent time scales and diﬀerent regions of the universe. It
has been pointed out recently that cosmological variations of physical constants linked to
scalar ﬁelds should also be detectable on the surface of local gravitationally bound systems
[31]. This means that terrestrial laboratory experiments should in principle be able to reﬂect
variations observed in interstellar gas clouds. Concerning the possible time dependence, one
may expect the most dramatic variations during the very early phases of the evolution of
the universe, e.g. during the inﬂationary period. Because the time scale on which variations
seem to appear in the astrophysical observations is logarithmically much closer to our epoch
than to the Big Bang, a simple linear time evolution of the constants may be used as a ﬁrst
approximation to model the behavior over the past few billion years.

In the following, we present recent precision measurements with the Yb+ optical fre-
In
quency standard at PTB that augment the existing record of data from this system.
combination with data from NIST, Boulder, on the Hg+ standard a new model-independent
limit on the variation of α is obtained. Combining this with data from LNE-SYRTE, Paris,
on the constancy of the Rb/Cs hyperﬁne frequency ratio and using the Schmidt model for
the nuclear g-factors of Rb and Cs, a limit on the variation of µ is obtained.

2. Measurements of the Yb+ optical frequency standard at 688 THz

The 171Yb+ ion is attractive as an optical frequency standard because it oﬀers narrow
reference transitions with small systematic frequency shift. At PTB, the electric quadrupole
transition (2S1/2, F = 0) → (2D3/2, F = 2) at 436 nm wavelength (688 THz frequency) with
a natural linewidth of 3.1 Hz is investigated [32, 33, 34, 35]. A single ytterbium ion is trapped
in a miniature Paul trap and is laser-cooled to a sub-millikelvin temperature by exciting the
low-frequency wing of the quasi-cyclic (F = 1) → (F = 0) component of the 2S1/2 → 2P1/2
resonance transition at 370 nm (cf. Fig. 1). The S → D electric quadrupole reference
transition is probed by the frequency doubled radiation from a diode laser emitting at 871
nm. The short term frequency stability of this laser is derived from a temperature-stabilized
and seismically isolated high-ﬁnesse reference cavity.

Figure 1b shows a high-resolution excitation spectrum obtained with 90 ms long laser
pulses, leading to an approximately Fourier-limited linewidth of 10 Hz, or a resolution ∆ν/ν
of 1.4 · 10−14. Since the duration of the probe pulse is longer than the lifetime of the excited
state (51 ms), the observed maximum excitation probability is limited by spontaneous decay.

Figure 1: a) Simpliﬁed level scheme of the 171Yb+ ion. b) Excitation spectrum of the
2S1/2(F = 0, mF = 0) → 2D3/2(F = 2, mF = 0) transition, obtained with 20 probe cycles
for each value of the detuning. The linewidth of 10 Hz is approximately at the Fourier limit
for the employed probe pulses of 90 ms duration.

In order to operate the system as a frequency standard, both wings of the resonance are
probed alternately, and the probe light frequency is stabilized to the line center according
to the diﬀerence of the measured excitation probabilities [34].

For quantitative studies of systematic frequency shifts we have compared the line center
frequencies of two 171Yb+ ions stored in separate traps [33]. The mean frequency diﬀerence
between the two traps was in the sub-hertz range for nominally unperturbed conditions.
The dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the 171Yb+ optical frequency standard is
the so-called quadrupole shift of the atomic transition frequency. It is due to the interaction
of the electric quadrupole moment of the D3/2 state with the gradient of static electric patch
ﬁelds in the trap. The frequency diﬀerence between the two systems shows a relative insta-
bility (Allan deviation) of σy(1000 s) = 5 · 10−16, limited essentially by quantum projection
noise [34].

The absolute frequency of the 171Yb+ standard at 688 THz was measured relative to
PTB’s cesium fountain clock CSF1 [36, 37]. The link between optical and microwave fre-
quencies is established with a femtosecond-laser frequency comb generator [38]. The 171Yb+
frequency was measured ﬁrst in December 2000 [39]. Fig. 2 shows the results of all frequency
measurements performed up to June 2006, showing a steady decrease of the measurement
uncertainty and excellent overall consistency. Technical improvements over the years were
made in the resolution of the ionic resonance, in the control of trapping conditions, and in
the frequency comb generator setup. The latter was based on a titanium sapphire laser in
the earlier experiments (until MJD 53000) and on an erbium doped ﬁber laser since [40].
Between July 2005 and June 2006 ﬁve absolute frequency measurements with continuous
averaging times of up to 36 h were performed. The obtained statistical uncertainties (about
6 · 10−16 after two days) are dominated by the white frequency noise of the cesium fountain.
The relative systematic uncertainty contribution of the cesium reference of 1.2·10−15 is based
on a recently completed evaluation of CSF1 that is applicable to the 2005/06 measurements
in retrospect. The systematic uncertainty contribution for the Yb+ standard of 1.5 · 10−15
is largely dominated by an estimate of 1 Hz for the stray-ﬁeld induced quadrupole shift.

The weighted average over these measurements gives the present result for the frequency

of the 171Yb+ 2S1/2(F = 0) → 2D3/2(F = 2) transition:

fYb = 688 358 979 309 307.6(1.4) Hz

Day of Measurement (MJD)

Figure 2: Results of absolute frequency measurements of the Yb+ optical frequency stan-
dard at 688 THz, plotted as a function of measurement date (MJD: Modiﬁed Julian Date),
covering the period from December 2000 to June 2006. The dotted straight line is the result
of a weighted linear regression through the data points. The gray lines indicate the ±1σ
range for the slope as determined from the regression. The intercepts of the gray lines are
chosen such that they cross in the point determined by the weighted averages of frequency
and measurement date.

with a total relative uncertainty of 2.0 · 10−15. This frequency value refers to a measurement
at room temperature (296 K). Extrapolating to zero temperature (as it was done for the
cesium clock) the frequency would have to be corrected for the AC Stark shift from blackbody
radiation, i.e. increased by 0.37(5) Hz.

From a weighted linear regression of the sequence of frequency measurements (cf. Fig.
2) we obtain a slope of (−0.54 ± 0.97) Hz/yr, corresponding to a value for the fractional
temporal variation of the frequency ratio d ln(fYb/fCs)/dt = (−0.78 ± 1.40) · 10−15 yr−1,
consistent with zero. This result can now be used to obtain new stringent limits on variations
of α and µ.

3. Limit on variations of the ﬁne structure constant

For the analysis we use a simple parametrization that includes only a minimum of as-

sumptions. The electronic transition frequency is expressed as [4, 26]

f = const · Ry · F (α)

(2)

where Ry = mee4/(8ǫ0h3) ≃ 3.2898 · 1015 Hz is the Rydberg frequency, appearing as the
common atomic scaling factor. F (α) is a dimensionless function of α that takes relativistic
contributions to the level energies into account [27, 28]. The numerical constant in front
depends only on integer or half-integer quantum numbers characterizing the atomic structure
and is independent of time. The relative temporal derivative of the frequency f can be
written as:

d ln α
dt
The ﬁrst term d ln Ry/dt represents a variation that would be common to all measurements of

electronic transition frequencies: a change of the numerical value of the Rydberg frequency.1
The second term in Eq. 3 is speciﬁc to the atomic transition under study. The sensitivity
factor A for small changes of α has been calculated for the relevant transitions by Dzuba,
Flambaum et al. [28, 29].

To obtain a limit on d ln α/dt we combine the data from 171Yb+ with results on the
constancy of a transition frequency in 199Hg+, measured at NIST [41, 25]. The transition
5d106s 2S1/2 → 5d96s2 2D5/2 of the mercury ion at 282 nm (1065 THz) with a natural
linewidth of 1.9 Hz is studied. A sequence of measurements over the period from August
2000 to November 2002 has resulted in a constraint on the fractional variation of fHg/fCs
at the level of 7 · 10−15 yr−1 [41]. From more recent data[25] with lower uncertainty a new
limit d ln(fHg/fCs)/dt = (0.27 ± 0.78) · 10−15 yr−1 can be derived.

The sensitivities of the ytterbium and mercury transition frequencies to changes of α are
quite diﬀerent [28, 29]: AYb = 0.88 and AHg = −3.19. The change of sign of A between the
two transitions reﬂects the fact that in Yb+ a 6s-electron is excited to the empty 5d-shell,
while in Hg+ a hole is created in the ﬁlled 5d-shell when the electron is excited to 6s. The
two measured drift rates together with Eq. 3 can now be used to calculate:

d ln α

= (−0.55 ± 1.11) · 10

(5)

We conclude that to within an uncertainty of 4 parts in 1016 per year, the ﬁne structure
constant is constant in the present epoch. This result can be qualiﬁed as model-independent
because it is only the simple expression Eq. 2 and the ab initio atomic structure calculations
of the A-values that have been used in the interpretation of the experimental data. The
constancy of Ry implies that there is no temporal drift between atomic gross structure
frequencies and the cesium hyperﬁne splitting. This is of importance for metrology because
it means that a cesium clock and an optical atomic clock can be regarded as fundamentally
equivalent.

Figure 3 shows how the two frequency drift rate measurements contribute to the con-
straints on changes in α and in Ry. Shown is also the standard uncertainty ellipse within
the central parallelogram. In comparison to the earlier analysis that we published in 2004
[30], based on the data available at the time, the 1σ uncertainty in d ln α/dt has decreased
by a factor of ﬁve. Though over a very diﬀerent time scale, the laboratory experiments have
now reached the same sensitivity for d ln α/dt as the analysis of quasar absorption spectra,
if a linear time evolution of α is assumed.

4. Limit on variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio

The ratio µ = mp/me is the second important dimensionless number whose possible
variability was studied in astrophysical observations, especially in H2 and OH molecular
spectra.
In the laboratory, molecular spectroscopy could also provide a direct access to
a variability of µ [42], but has not yet reached the precision that has been achieved for
electronic and hyperﬁne transitions in atoms. Data from the latter can, however, be used
to derive a model-dependent limit on d ln µ/dt along the lines described in Refs. [43,44].

1This statement refers to a dimensional quantity (frequency) in an SI unit (hertz). Since the SI second is
ﬁxed to a property of the 133Cs nucleus, possible variations of the quantity Ry are not purely electromagnetic
in origin – as one would expect for an abstract physical quantity “Rydberg constant” – but are also related
to the strong interaction.

where F ′(α) describes relativistic corrections and µCs/µB is the cesium nuclear magnetic

A very precise result has been published on the constancy of the ratio of ground state
hyperﬁne frequencies in 87Rb with respect to 133Cs [20]: d ln(fCs/fRb)/dt = (0.05 ± 0.53) ·
10−15 yr−1. Since this frequency ratio scales like (µCs/µRb)α0.49 one may combine this
experimental result with the limit on the variation of α (Eq. 4) in order to establish a limit
on the temporal drift of the ratio of magnetic moments:

d ln(µCs/µRb)
dt

= (0.18 ± 0.56) · 10

−15 yr

−1.

We can now derive model-dependent results on the proton g-factor gp and on the proton-
to-electron mass ratio by using the Schmidt model [45] that relates the nuclear magnetic
moment to the magnetic moment of a single unpaired nucleon – a proton in the cases of 87Rb
and 133Cs. The predictions of the Schmidt model agree with the actual values to within

about 25% for 87Rb and to within 50% for 133Cs. An uncertainty due to the application of
this model is not included in the uncertainties of the limits presented in the following. From
the Schmidt model expression µCs/µRb ∝ (10 − gp)/(gp + 2), the limit on the drift of the
magnetic moments can be applied to constrain a possible drift of gp:

d ln gp
dt

= (−0.09 ± 0.28) · 10

(10)

Using the Schmidt model expression for the cesium magnetic moment µCs = 7(10 −
gp)µN /18 (with the nuclear magneton µN ) and the fact that µB/µN = mp/me = µ one can
write the ratio of an optical electronic transition frequency to the cesium hyperﬁne frequency
as

Fopt
α2F ′
Cs
Combining the limit on the drift rate of gp (Eq. 10) with the results on the constancy of
the optical frequencies in Hg+ and Yb+, a limit on the present temporal variation of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio is obtained:

Compared to the previous evaluation [43] these limits to variations of the magnetic
moments and mass ratio are now more strict by about a factor of three. Like in the case
of α, the laboratory experiments reach the same sensitivity for d ln µ/dt as the analysis of
quasar absorption spectra under the assumption of a linear time evolution. We would like
to point out, however, that the presented result on dα/dt should be valued higher than the
one on dµ/dt because the latter is model-dependent. A more detailed parametrization of
nuclear magnetic moments in terms of quark masses has been published [46] and can be
used if more precision data from diﬀerent nuclei becomes available.

5. Conclusion

The recent progress in the accuracy and reproducibility of optical frequency standards
allows one to perform a sensitive laboratory search for temporal variations of fundamen-
tal constants. So far all these experimental results are consistent with the constancy of
constants. We have presented an update on limits to variations based on recent optical
frequency measurements in single trapped ions. Coincidentally, the laboratory experiments
over time scales ∆t ≈ 5 yr presently reach about the same sensitivity for changes of the ﬁne
structure constant ∆α/∆t as the astrophysical observations in quasar absorption spectra
over a time scale ∆t ≈ 1010 yr. The laboratory search will soon become more sensitive, as
the precision of frequency standards continues to improve. In addition, a larger variety of
systems is now being investigated so that it will be possible to perform tests of the consis-
tency if a ﬁrst observation of a variation in the laboratory is reported. The introduction of
cooling techniques for small molecules will lead to more precise spectroscopy and to more
sensitive tests for a variability of µ. In nuclear physics, a very promising system has recently
been identiﬁed in the closely spaced lowest states of the 229Th nucleus [47]. This system has
the potential to extend the scale for a search for changes in the strong and electromagnetic
interactions by ﬁve orders of magnitude [48].

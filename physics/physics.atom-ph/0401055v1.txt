(Dated: February 20, 2014)

We present an extensive study of the unique thermal and mechanical dynamics for a narrow-line
88Sr magneto-optical trap. For negative detuning, trap dynamics reveal a transition from
1S0 - 3P1
the semiclassical regime to the photon-recoil-dominated quantum regime. Equilibrium tempera-
tures range from detuning-independent values scaled by the power-broadened transition linewidth,
to detuning-dependent minima well below the Doppler limit, to absolute minima below the single-
photon recoil limit. For positive detuning, the cloud divides into discrete momentum packets re-
sembling lattice points on a face-centered-cubic crystal. This novel behavior arises from velocity
selection and “positive feedback” acceleration due to a ﬁnite number of photon recoils. Cooling is
achieved with blue-detuned light around a velocity where gravity balances the radiative force.

Magneto-optical

forbidden transitions have
recently attracted con-
siderable attention as starting points for all-optical
quantum degenerate gases [1], single-system tests of
Doppler and sub-Doppler cooling theory [2], and es-
sential components in the next generation of optical
frequency standards [3, 4, 5]. Of the currently studied
systems, 689 nm 1S0 - 3P1 Strontium (Sr) MOTs [6]
are particularly relevant to fundamental atomic physics
since single-photon recoil momenta directly inﬂuence
both mechanical and thermodynamic trap properties.
To date, however, many of the rich dynamics for this
unique system remain experimentally unexplored.

In this Letter we report a set of novel 1S0 - 3P1
MOT thermal and mechanical dynamics. For laser fre-
quencies (ωL) tuned below the atomic resonance (ωA),
ωA < 0, trap dynamics separate into

the power-broadened linewidth ΓE = Γ√1 + s is deter-
mined by the saturation parameter s = I/IS. Here I (IS

saturation intensity). Importantly, Γ

gle beams over small, well-deﬁned spatial ranges. Gravity
also plays an important role as the ratio R of the max-
imum light-induced acceleration vs gravity ~kΓ/2mg is
16, where 2π~ is Planck’s constant, k is the light
only
wave-vector, m is the 88Sr mass, and g is the gravita-
tional acceleration. Trapped atoms relocate to vertical
positions where magnetic-ﬁeld-induced level shifts com-
and the resultant radiation force balances

gravity, leading to an equilibrium temperature indepen-
dent of δ. In the second regime,
Γ, a
dispersion-shaped cooling force emerges and thermody-
namics reminiscent of ordinary Doppler cooling including
δ- and s-dependent temperature minima occur, although
with values globally smaller than standard Doppler the-
ory predictions. In the third case, s approaches unity, the
photon-recoil-driven impulsive force dominates, and the

temperature falls below the photon recoil limit as pre-
dicted by a fully quantum treatment [7]. For δ > 0, the
sample divides into discrete momentum packets resem-
bling lattice points on three-dimensional face-centered-
cubic crystals. This unique behavior, occurring in the
absence of atomic coherence, arises from velocity selec-
tion and “positive feedback” acceleration wherein a small
number of absorption events dramatically inﬂuence sys-
tem dynamics. More surprisingly, with δ > 0, cooling is
achieved around a velocity where radiation pressure and
gravity balance.

1S0 - 3P1 traps are formed by ﬁrst pre-cooling 88Sr in
a standard six-beam 461 nm 1S0 - 1P1 MOT loaded by
a Zeeman slowed and transversely cooled atomic beam.
The trap axial magnetic ﬁeld gradient dBz (oriented
along gravity) is 50 G/cm. Typical trap populations (life-
107 (20 ms), limited by radiative branch-
times) are 3
×
10−9 Torr. Following this
ing [8]. Vacuum levels are
∼
pre-cooling stage, atoms are transferred to 1S0 - 3P1
MOTs by ﬁrst turning oﬀ the 461 nm light and atomic
beam shutter, rapidly lowering dBz to 3 G/cm, and ap-
plying red-detuned broadband frequency-modulated 689
nm light [6]. Modulation parameters are set to provide
complete spectral coverage of the initial Doppler proﬁle
while matching the MOT size associated with a single-
frequency operation. Over the next 50 ms, the cloud
is compressed by linearly increasing dBz to 10 G/cm.
Subsequently, single-frequency 689 nm light forms the
MOT. The 689 nm light is generated by an extended cav-
ity diode laser that is locked to a vibrationally isolated,
temperature-controlled high-ﬁnesse cavity and separately
to the 1S0 - 3P1 resonance. This laser, with a linewidth of
< 100 Hz, injection locks a slave laser used for the trap.
The laser spectrum is manipulated with a double-passed
acousto-optic modulator. The optimal transfer eﬃciency
from 1S0 - 1P1 MOTs to 1S0 - 3P1 MOTs is
30%, giv-
107. Typical measured trap
ing trap populations of
1011
1 s and
lifetimes and spatial densities are
cm−3, respectively. Trap dynamics are monitored either
by in-situ or time-of-ﬂight (TOF) ﬂuorescence imaging.

where s′ (
s) signiﬁes contributions from other partic-
ipating beams and gJ = 1.5 (µ) is the 3P1 state Lande
g-factor (Bohr magneton over ~). The force along x (or y)
is similar to Eq. (1), but without gravity. In the regime
>> ΓE >> Γ, trap dynamics are dominated by
where
ΓE, force com-
single-beam interactions while for
ponents of the respective beams overlap.
In the latter
case, Eq.
(1) provides a dispersion-shaped force simi-
lar to Doppler cooling with a broad transition. Figure
1(a) presents the calculated 1S0 - 3P1 radiative force for
dBz = 10 G/cm, s = s′ = 248, and a range of δ values.
The force is displayed with respect to position (veloc-
ity) in the bottom (upper) axis, for vx or vy=0 (x or
y=0). As δ decreases, the force makes a clear transition
from an isolated form where excitation occurs over two
separate and well-deﬁned spatial ranges to a dispersion-
shaped form wherein excitation occurs over the entire
trap volume and cloud dynamics are typically modeled as
damped harmonic motion [8]. The trap potential energy
PE (Fig. 1(a) insets) reﬂects this change: as δ decreases,
the initially box-shaped potential becomes progressively
more “U”-shaped and the vertical trap center, deﬁned by
PE minima, shifts upward. Finally, in the third regime
when ΓE approaches Γ at small s, the cooling force again
assumes an isolated form.
In this case, however, sin-
gle photon recoils dramatically inﬂuence trap dynamics
which in turn requires a full quantum treatment [7]. For
the complex problem of 3D cooling, a Monte Carlo ap-
proach is the only practical tool.

Changes in the force are dramatically revealed in me-
In the

dispersion-shaped cooling regime the cloud aspect ratio
is
2:1, typical for MOTs operating on broad transitions.
Conversely, in the isolated regime atoms move freely be-
tween “hard wall” boundaries. Consequently, the cloud
horizontal width is determined entirely by the separa-
tion between horizontal force maxima, an eﬀect clearly
revealed by the overlaid maximum force contours calcu-
lated from Eq. (1). Moreover, since the radiative force
16) and the thermal
is comparable to gravity (recall R
energy is small compared to the gravity potential energy,
atoms sag to the bottom of the trap and the lower cloud
boundary z0 = ∆/(gJ µdBz) is well deﬁned. Figure 1(c)
shows z0 versus δ, with a linear ﬁt to the data giving
dz0/dδ = 0.509(4) µm/kHz, in agreement with the ex-
pected linear slope of 0.478(2) µm/kHz at the 5% level.
Independent demonstration of these unique mechanical
properties is provided by the trap population N versus δ
(see Fig. 1(c) inset). Here, it is important to note that
following broadband cooling, the cloud vertical and hor-
izontal 1/e2 radii (rz and rh, respectively) are set by the
laser modulation spectrum and the ﬁnal value for dBz.

In the ﬁgure, open circles give N versus δ when rz =
0.79 mm and rh = 1.56 mm. According to the Fig. 1(a)
model, the 1S0 - 3P1 MOT acquires these dimensions at δ
= -1637 kHz, which lies within 2% of the δ value where N
is peaked, indicating that maximum transfer between the
broadband and single-frequency stages can be achieved
by “mode matching” rz and rh to the 1S0 - 3P1 MOT
box size. Conﬁrmation for this idea is provided by the
ﬁlled dots in the ﬁgure which give N when the cloud and
trap sizes are matched at each δ.

Studying the MOT temperature TM versus δ and s
provides rich information about trap dynamics. Figure
2(a) displays TM versus δ at three diﬀerent s. For large
and s, corresponding to the ﬁrst cooling regime, Eq.
δ
|
(1) reﬂects a balance between gravity and the radiative
force from the upward-propagating beam at z0 [9]. Thus
the cooling force is determined by a Taylor expansion of
Eq.
(1) around vz=0 for z=z0. With the atomic po-
sition (z0) self-adjusting to follow δ, the cooling force
and the momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient are basically δ-
independent, giving a predicted temperature of TM =
1/s)−1/2] where kB is Boltz-
~ΓE/(2kB)[0.5R(R
mann’s constant. The quantity inside the square bracket
is nearly 2, independent of s for the relevant experimen-
tal range. The resultant temperature at large δ is clearly

Fig. 2(b) shows TM vs.
intensity at a ﬁxed large de-
tuning δ = -520 kHz, showing good agreement with the
above prediction. The result arises from the semiclassical
nature of this cooling regime where ΓE is the natural en-
ergy scale. Note the underlying physics is the same as the
two-beam case where standard Doppler theory predicts a
ΓE- and δ-dependent temperature limit of ~ΓE/2kB [10].
Γ, Eq. (1) produces a dispersion-
shaped cooling force resembling ordinary Doppler cool-
ing. δ- and intensity-dependent temperature minima ap-
pear appear as shown in Fig. 2(a), with the minimum TM
and its
-location both decreasing with s. Such behavior

is predicted by Doppler theory, with the “Doppler Limit”
achieved at
= ΓE/2. However, in order to match the
data, the theory curves, shown as solid lines in Fig. 2(a),
need to be multiplied by a global scaling factor (< 1)
whose value decreases with s. Moreover, minimum tem-
peratures lie well below (~ΓE)/(2kB) as shown by open
circles in Fig. 2(b). For the highest intensity, the scaling
factor is explained by a semiclassical treatment based on
Eq. (1) while for the lower intensities, this is no longer
true. This behavior suggests that even at a large value
of s such as 250, a full quantum treatment is necessary.
Such a treatment as presented in [7] predicts a decreasing
value of

as s decreases for optimum cooling.
Figure 2(c) presents an intuitive picture of the tran-
sition from the second to the third cooling regime. The
radiative force changes from a semiclassical dispersion-
shaped form into a single-photon-recoil dominated im-
pulsive form. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the predicted cool-
ing limit of half the recoil temperature TR/2 = ~ωR/kB

[7] is experimentally reached as s approaches unity and
the system enters the third cooling regime. The ap-
proach to thermal equilibrium (see Fig. 2(d)) is also
unique. Here, the observed exponential approach (ne-
glecting rapid changes at short times due to atoms falling
outside the trap capture velocity) has 1/e time constants
τ ranging from 14(2) ms at s = 4250 to 3.1(4) ms at
s = 6.1. The value at large intensity is consistent with
Doppler theory [10], which predicts τ
12 ms at s =
4250. For s = 6.1, Doppler theory predicts a long time
constant of 4500 ms, in sharp contrast to the experimen-
tal value, which agrees instead with predictions based on
quantum theory. At low saturation, the Rabi frequency
nearly equals the recoil shift, giving a time constant on
the order of 1/Γ [7].

∼

Tuning to δ > 0 presents another intriguing set of cool-
ing and motional dynamics. In contrast to MOTs oper-
ating on broad transitions wherein population is isotropi-
cally expelled, the cloud divides into discrete momentum
packets resembling lattice points on three-dimensional
face-centered-cubic crystals [11]. Figure 3(a) depicts the
underlying momentum-space structure which, as shown
below, occurs due to velocity selection followed by highly
directional (i.e., minimal heating) “positive feedback” ac-
celeration.
Interestingly, symmetry dictates that cube
corners correspond to three-beam processes while mid-
points between corners and cube face centers arise from

shows top view (slightly oﬀ vertical) TOF images for s =
30, dBz = 0 G/cm, a ﬂight time tF = 20 ms, and tH =
tV = 25 ms, where tH (tV ) is time spent in the horizontal
x-y plane (along z-axis) trapping beams. As δ increases,
sets of n-beam ”lattice points” sequentially ﬁll, with n =
3 occurring ﬁrst, followed by n = 2,1. Notably, only two
vertical layers are observed in Fig. 3(b) while Fig. 3(a)
predicts the creation of three. This apparent contradic-
tion is resolved in Fig. 3(c), where the cloud is viewed in
the x-y plane at 45o to the x,y axes. Here, tV = 6, 25 ms
while tH = 25 ms. As clearly shown by the images, the
lowest two layers in Fig. 3(a) are only spatially distinct
for short tV , merging together for the tV = 25 ms used
in Fig. 3(b). Hence, more (less) intense packets in Fig.
3(b) are due to the lowest two (uppermost) cube layers.
Insight into the above dynamics can be obtained by
solving Eq. (1). Here, it is important to recall (1) for δ
> 0, resonant absorption occurs between trapping beams
and atoms for which ~k
~v > 0, (2) the absorption pro-
cess accelerates rather than decelerates the atoms, de-
creasing the probability for absorption events that slow
atomic motion and enabling “positive feedback” in ve-
locity space, (3) ΓE and δ determine the range of initial
velocities that experience eﬃcient acceleration, and (4)
ΓE sets the ﬁnal velocity spread. As shown in Fig. 4,
these factors allow, in cases where ΓE . 10ωR, for ef-
ﬁcient velocity bunching and a δ-dependent number of
velocity bunched groups. Considering motion in the hor-
izontal plane ﬁrst, Fig 4(a) shows, for s = 30 and tH =

every initial velocity are bunched into two groups having

0 cm/s, 23 cm/s, and -23 cm/s. Similar dynamics
vf ∼
occur in the vertical direction where gravity now plays an
important role. Fig. 4(b) shows vf versus vi for s = 30,
δ = 140 kHz and tV times relevant to Fig. 3(c). Notably,
for the upward-moving velocity group, even though δ >
0, atoms experience cooling around a velocity v0 where
gravity balances the radiative force, producing the sharp
velocity and thus spatial distribution shown in both ex-
periment (Fig. 3(c)) and theory (Fig. 4(b)). Theoreti-
cally we ﬁnd the cooling mechanism arising from a Taylor
expansion of Eq. (1) around v0 and the resultant equi-

For comparison with Fig. 3, Fig. 4(c) and 4(d) give
spatial distributions corresponding to the ﬁnal velocity
distributions shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), given the mea-
sured initial cloud temperature. Fig. 4(c) corresponds
to either x or y cube axes in Fig. 3(b).
Importantly,
the model correctly reproduces cloud shape asymmetries
(see, for example, the sharp edge on the top of the upper-
most layer in Fig. 3(c)), the δ-dependent number of pack-
ets and relative populations, and the tV -dependence for
the number of vertical layers. Predicted packet spacings,
however, are
larger than observed. Measuring the
position of the upward moving layer in Figs. 3(c) versus
tV provides an explanation for this discrepancy. Mea-
sured values for vf and the acceleration are slightly less
than predicted, an outcome consistent with small stray
magnetic ﬁeld gradients which shift v0 as the atoms move
upward [12], giving an apparent downward acceleration.
When the calculations take into account a small mea-
sured permanent vacuum chamber magnetization, dBz
0.1 G/cm, predicted and measured positions agree.

In summary, we have performed detailed studies of the
transition from semi-classical to full quantum cooling, re-
vealing signatures of each regime without ambiguity. Our
results show, for the ﬁrst time, that the cooling limit of
TR/2 can be reached. More surprisingly, when δ > 0, the
cold atom sample divides into well deﬁned momentum
packets and cooling is achieved around a velocity where
gravity balances the radiative force.

[11] This analogy is not rigurous since face-centered-cubic

occurs in the horizontal plane.

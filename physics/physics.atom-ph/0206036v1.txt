Quantum phase transition in the Hartree-Fock wave function of the hydrogen molecule

(Dated: July 24, 2013)

Precise solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations for the ground state of the hydrogen molecule are
obtained for a wide range of internuclear distances R by means of a two-dimensional fully numerical
mesh computational method. The spatial parts of the single-electron wave functions are found to
be coinciding for R < 2.30 a.u. At larger distances they become diﬀerent and as R → ∞ each of
them takes the form corresponding to a separate atom. This quantum phase transition occurring at
R = 2.30 a.u. gives a natural boundary between a delocalized behavior of electrons in the molecule
and their distribution over separate atoms. This phenomenon can be also considered as an analog
of the Wigner crystallization or the Mott transition on the level of a single molecule.

In recent years multiple studies of quantum phase tran-
sitions were carried out. These studies are signiﬁcant
for understanding of many complicated phenomena in
solid states, clusters and so on. As an example, stud-
ies of the Wigner crystallization in two-dimensional sys-
tems can be presented [1]. Many of these eﬀects are as-
sociated with symmetry breakings in the Hartree-Fock
ground states. On the other hand, spontaneous symme-
try breakings in molecular systems were reported mainly
in a negative context [2]. In this communication we study
the simplest molecule with more than one electron, i.e.
the H2 molecule, for arbitrary internuclear distances R.
This molecule was investigated in a number of works by
means of many precise methods (see [3]). On the other
hand, there are no studies of precise solutions of the
Hartree-Fock equations for the H2 molecule for arbitrary
internuclear distances. We present such calculations and
show that at some R = Rcr the wave function of the
ground state undergo a quantum phase transition associ-
ated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking. This tran-
sition separates a phase with two fully delocalized elec-
trons with equal spatial parts of their wave functions and
a phase with two electrons localized on separate atoms
(R > Rcr). This phenomenon is very similar to the form-
ing of Wigner crystals or Mott transitions in the solid
state context. Due to this phase transition the solution
of the Hartree-Fock equations has a reasonable physical
meaning for arbitrary R values, that does not take place
in a traditional approach with single-electron wave func-
tions having the symmetry of the molecule as the whole
at all the R values [4]. This result allows us to expect,
that, as well as in the solid state physics, some symme-
try breakings in more complicated molecules and similar
systems also could be not computational artifacts [2] but
have an appropriate physical meaning.

We solve a system of the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations
by a fully numerical two-dimensional ﬁnite-diﬀerence
(mesh) method [5, 6, 7]. The equations are presented
in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) with the axis z coin-
ciding with the molecular axis. The point z = 0 cor-
responds to the center of gravity of the molecule. For

each single-electron wave function a deﬁnite value of the
magnetic quantum number is supposed (m = 0 for the
ground state, considered below), so that a numerical so-
lution is carried out on the plane (ρ, z). Thus, the wave
function of the spin singlet ground state has the form

Ψ = ψ1(ρ1, z1)ψ2(ρ2, z2)

where ψ1 and ψ2 are solutions of the Hartree-Fock equa-
tions for the ﬁrst and second electrons. The correspond-
ing energy of the electron system we denote as Ee. When
ψ1 6= ψ2 this wave function is not an eigenfunction of the
spin operator ˆS2
. In this case it is possible to consider
also a spin-symmetrised two-determinant wave function

Ψsymm = [ψ1(ρ1, z1)ψ2(ρ2, z2) + ψ2(ρ1, z1)ψ1(ρ2, z2)]

and the corresponding energy Esymm
. The latter wave
function is an eigenfunction of the operator ˆS2 as ψ1 6=
ψ2.

e

A traditional approach to solution of the molecular
Hartree-Fock problem employs fully delocalized molecu-
lar orbitals. In our case this means ψ1 = ψ2. This allows
obtaining reasonable results only for relatively small R
values. For large distances atomic orbitals strictly local-
ized near corresponding nuclei are sometimes considered.
Of course, every combination of such approaches gives
rise to a problem of intermediate values of the parameter
R. In our calculations we are free from limitations asso-
ciated with a choice of basis functions and do not require
this or that way of behavior from ψ1 and ψ2. They are
direct solutions of the initial equations.

The results obtained in our numerical solution of the
Hartree-Fock equations are presented in the Table I and
Figures 1-3. All the data are given in atomic units. As
one can see, the solutions have very diﬀerent characters
for R < 2.3 and for R > 2.3. Several plots of the spa-
tial parts of the single-electron wave functions ψ1 and
ψ2 for diﬀerent R are given in Figure 1. For R > 2.3
we have ψ1 6= ψ2 (functions a and b in the plots), and
with growing R these solutions transform into wave func-
tions of separate hydrogen atoms. On the other hand, at

R < 2.3 the functions ψ1 and ψ2 fully coincide. This
relation between ψ1 and ψ2 as well as the existence of
the critical point R = Rcr for solutions of the Hartree-
Fock equations can be illustrated by the behavior of
their overlap integral hψ1|ψ2i given in Table I and Fig-
ure 2. For R < Rcr an exact equality hψ1|ψ2i = 1 takes
place, whereas for R above the critical point the function
hψ1|ψ2i (R) shows a near to an exponential decrease with
increasing R values. Our calculations in a vicinity of the
critical point allow to estimate its position as Rcr = 2.30
or, more precisely, Rcr = 2.29999. For R < Rcr we have
ψi(ρ, z) = ψi(ρ, −z) (i = 1, 2), whereas for R > Rcr this
symmetry condition does not take place and only con-
dition ψ1(ρ, z) = ψ2(ρ, −z) is preserved.
It should be
emphasized, that the transition from the single-electron
wave functions, symmetric with respect to the center of
the molecule, to the non-symmetric ones is an intrinsic
property of the Hartree-Fock equations for the hydrogen
molecule. Thus, for the hydrogen molecule at R > Rcr
a spontaneously broken symmetry in the Hartree-Fock
wave function takes place. A similar eﬀect has been found
previously for the beryllium atom [7]. From the point of
view of the numerical techniques the Hartree-Fock iter-
ations can be started from initial wave functions with
arbitrary small deviations from exact z = 0 parity. The
ﬁnal result of iterations does not depend on the degree
of this initial asymmetry (this could be simply round-oﬀ
errors) and has the form presented in Figure 1.

The Hartree-Fock electron energies of the hydrogen
molecule as well as numerical values of the hψ1|ψ2i are
presented in Table I. For R < Rcr the Hartree-Fock elec-
tron energy is an energy calculated on a one-determinant
wave function of the whole system Ee. Available pre-
cise HF result for the near to the equilibrium distance
R = 1.4 (Ee = −1.8479152858, [8]) coincide with our
one. Our energy for R = 0 can be considered as more
precise than the well known result for the helium atom
Ee = −2.8616799 [9]. For R > Rcr it is possible to calcu-
late the spin-symmetrised energy Esymm
also presented
in the table. This energy lies lower than Ee except the
cases hψ1|ψ2i = 0 and hψ1|ψ2i = 1, when both energies
evidently coincide.

e

As a discussion it is expedient to note that the result
obtained above contradicts to a frequently encountered
opinion, that even the simplest of molecules, the hydro-
gen molecule, dissociates incorrectly within the Hartree-
Fock approximation [4]. When we do not impose some
artiﬁcial conditions (i.e. the symmetry of the molecule as
a whole) on single-electron wave functions, the consistent
Hartree-Fock approach allows obtaining quite reasonable
solutions for arbitrary internuclear separations. An ex-
ception are Van der Waals forces, which cannot be ob-
tained in the Hartree-Fock approximation. In the limit
R → ∞ our solution describes two separate atoms (H
+ H) with electronic wave functions ψ1 and ψ2 respec-
tively. On the other hand, when establishing symmetry

conditions ψi(ρ, z) = ψi(ρ, −z) or/and ψ1 = ψ2, we have
in the limit R → ∞ a traditional non-physical Hartree-
Fock result (see [4]), which does not correspond to the
ground states of the systems H + H or H− + p.

Some diﬀerent interpretation of our result could be ob-
tained when we consider two separate hydrogen atoms
with anti-parallel spins of electrons and trace their wave
functions when shortening the distance between them.
Let us examine, for example, a dipole moment hzati of a
hydrogen atom, when it nears to another hydrogen atom.
This dependence is presented in Figure 3. As well as the
overlap integral this value increases nearly exponential
with reducing R at large distances, but its behavior near
the critical point is even more pronounced because its

derivative becomes inﬁnite here. For R < Rcr an evident
for delocalized electrons relation zat = R/2 takes place.
It is natural to ask a question about behavior of
Hartree-Fock wave functions of other states of the hy-
drogen molecule at large R. A detailed investigation lies
outside the scope of this communication and we outline
here the main characteristics of states, which could be
considered from some points of view as resembling the

ground state conﬁgurations of H + H or H− + p in the
limit R → ∞.
In the notation of a united atom they
are conﬁgurations 1s ↑ 2p0 ↓, 1s ↑ 2p0 ↑ and 2p2
0, along
with the ground state 1s2 considered above. There is
no quantum phase transitions in both singlet and triplet
conﬁgurations 1s2p0. As R → ∞ the energy of the single-
determinant wave function for the 1s ↑ 2p0 ↓ (as well as
for the 2p2
0 when ψi(ρ, z) = −ψi(ρ, −z) and ψ1 = ψ2) has
a non-physical limit coinciding with that for 1s2 under
condition ψ1 = ψ2. On the other hand, due to exchange
terms the energy of the triplet 1s2p0 conﬁguration has
the limit corresponding to the ground state of two sepa-
rate hydrogen atoms with parallel electron spins. A spin-
symmetrized two-determinant wave function of the sin-
glet 1s2p0 tends to that of the system H− + p as R → ∞.
The most complicated is the behavior of the conﬁguration
2p2
0, when we do not impose additional symmetries for it.
It retains its initial atomic symmetries up to R ≈ 2.97.
For larger R values the wave functions lose their parity
with respect to the plane z = 0, but they remain equal
up to R ≈ 5.9. At this point the second phase transition,
leading to ψ1 6= ψ2 takes place. However, this series of
transformations does not lead to a reasonable physical
result as R → ∞.

The eﬀect presented above can be considered in a va-
riety of aspects, and analogies with several circles of phe-
nomena could be established. One of these items is a
problem of localization of electrons in molecules (discus-
sions and references see in ref. [4], some more recent ap-
proaches see e.g. in ref. [10]). Our result gives a natural
boundary, separating two regimes: 1. Delocalized molec-
ular orbitals and 2. Electrons localized on separate atoms
(where, e.g. the value 1 − hψ1|ψ2i could be employed as
a proper characteristic of the localization). Thus, we can
consider our result as a solution of this problem for the
hydrogen molecule, and a possibility of similar solutions
for more complicated molecules can be expected.

Another evident analogy are the Mott transition,
Wigner localization and related topics like the Hubbard

above as an analog of the Wigner localization or Mott
transition on the level of a single molecule. Following
steps in this direction have to be, of course, investigations
of systems with more than two electrons, correlated sys-
tems and so on. Our calculations are carried out in the
Hartree-Fock approximation which can be considered as
obsolete and not precise for the hydrogen molecule. On
the other hand, precise solutions of Schr¨odinger equations
for more or less complex systems are unavailable and the
methods of the Hartree-Fock level are the best of existing
tools for them. Our result shows that for a simplest non-
ionized molecule the symmetry breaking in a solution of
the HF equations allows obtaining physically correct re-
sults for arbitrary internuclear distances and could give
a simple insight into various more complicated problems.

Abstract. We demonstrate that a recently published quasiclassical Møller type
approach [Geyer and Rost 2002, J. Phys. B 35 1479] can be used to overcome
the problem of autoionization, which arises in classical trajectory calculations for
many electron targets. In this method the target is stabilized dynamically by a
backward–forward propagation scheme. We illustrate this refocusing and present
total cross sections for single and double ionization of helium by electron impact.

Classical trajectory descriptions of atomic collisions and ionization processes have
a long history, dating back to the pioneering work of Abrines and Percival [1]. The
method has never become a mainstream tool, but has been used over the years for a
variety of collision systems. This so called CTMC (Classical Trajectory Monte–Carlo)
method was originally formulated with macroscopic point particles, scaled down to the
dimensions of a real hydrogen atom, but it can be derived as a discretized treatment
of the system’s Liouville equation, too (see, e.g.
In the hydrogen target, for
which CTMC was formulated initially, the single electron orbits around the nucleus
on a Kepler ellipse. If this concept is extended, the resulting many electron atom is
highly unstable: the electrons exchange energy and ﬁnally one of them ends up in a
very tightly bound orbit and all the others are kicked out of the atom. This process
is called autoionization, as it does not need any external perturbation. Therefore it
is practically impossible to use such a classical many electron atom as a target in a
CTMC calculation — it dissolves on its own before the approaching projectile has any
chance to interact with it.

[2]).

Various attempts have been made to stabilize classical many electron atoms, so
that they could be used in ionization and excitation calculations. These attempts
range from neglecting the target electrons’ interaction completely in the independent
electron model, through highly symmetric initial conﬁgurations, which autoionize
slightly slower [3], up to additional momentum dependent potentials to incorporate
the uncertainty relation [4]. These ans¨atze are then usable in CTMC calculations, but
they either describe a modiﬁed scattering system or lead to inconsistencies.

Motivated by these and other shortcomings of the standard CTMC method we
recently proposed a quasiclassical description for particle impact ionization, which is
derived as an approximation to the quantum mechanical description [5]: the Møller
formulation of the quantum scattering operator is translated into the Wigner phase
space formalism [6] and ﬁnally approximated by setting ¯h → 0. The approximation
procedure itself is well established and the resulting method is technically very similar
to CTMC, as in both treatments the cross sections are evaluated by propagating
classical trajectories. But nevertheless there are two fundamental diﬀerences: (i)
the phase space description of the target’s initial state is derived free of ambiguity
from the quantum mechanical wave function without the need to artiﬁcially introduce
quantization recipes for many electron atoms and (ii) the Møller form of the scattering
operator translates into a classical backward–forward–backward propagation scheme,
which stabilizes arbitrary initial distributions. With this ansatz we could calculate
fully diﬀerential cross sections for electron impact ionization of hydrogen, which
essentially reproduce the experimental results over a wide range of energies and
geometries [5]. We will now demonstrate that this approximation can also deal with
an autoionizing classical helium target.

As mentioned above our quasiclassical approximation is derived as the ¯h = 0 limit
of the Wigner formulation of the quantum scattering operator ˆS in the Møller form
(for details, please see [5] and references therein):

ˆS = Ω†

−Ω+ with Ω± = lim
t→∓∞

U †(t)U0(t)

The propagators U (t) = exp[−iHt] and U0(t) ﬁnally translate into solving Hamilton’s
equations of motion for each of the (multi dimensional) discretization points of the
initial distribution

ρ(t = 0) = ρi(x, p) = N X

wnδ(x − xn)δ(p − pn).

n
The weights wn are the values of the ¯h = 0 limit of the Wigner transform wi of
the initial state wave function at the discretization point: wn = wi(xn, pn). It can be
shown that the Wigner transform is only one special case to select the initial conditions;
by modifying the underlying correspondence rule nearly arbitrary translations between
wave functions and phase space distributions can be constructed [7, 8]. We will later
use this freedom to calculate cross sections with a more simple initial state distribution.
According to the Møller scheme each trajectory ﬁrst is propagated backward in
time under the asymptotic initial Hamiltonian H i
0, i.e., with the interaction between
target and projectile switched oﬀ. If not denoted otherwise we will in the following
use atomic units. Its form is then:

The subscript p denotes the projectile whereas the target electrons are labeled with 1

When projectile and target are separated far enough, denoted symbolically by
t = −∞, the interaction is switched on and the trajectory evolves forward again under
the full Hamiltonian H through the collision at t = 0 and on, until the fragments are
well separated again. Then the fragments are brought back from t = ∞ independently,
i.e., with the asymptotic ﬁnal H f

autoionizes already during the ﬁrst backward propagation. When the projectile–target
interaction is added at the turning point t = −∞, it is negligible ﬁrst; the forward
propagation eﬀectively undoes the autoionization and the projectile encounters the
refocused target in nearly its initial state. The autoionization still takes place, but
now it is shifted away to t < 0, where it has no inﬂuence on the actual collision
dynamics, which takes place around t = 0. There is consequently no need any more to
neglect some part of the interactions or to introduce additional stabilizing potentials.
In a quantum treatment the ﬁrst backward propagation only contributes a phase
shift, as the initial state is an eigenstate of H i
0. The cross sections remain unchanged,
if it is neglected. In the classical approximation, though, the target is not stationary
during the backward and the forward propagations; but if both are performed, most of
the error due to the approximation cancels and the target is eﬀectively stationary with
respect to the central time t = 0: it is this point in time, where the initial conditions
are set up, where the collision takes place and where ﬁnally the cross sections are
extracted.

The stabilizing eﬀect of this Møller type backward–forward–backward scheme is
demonstrated in ﬁgure 1: there the one-electron energies En = p2
rn , n = p, 1, 2,
of the projectile (solid line) and the two target electrons (broken lines) during one
trajectory, i.e., the evolution of one single discretization point, are plotted against the
propagation time. The interaction energies between the electrons are not included.
The propagation starts at t = 0 and ﬁrst proceeds backwards, here up to t = −100
a.u., under H i
0 (1), i.e., with target and projectile independent of each other. Then the
propagation reverses and the full H is used to propagate back to t = 0 and through
the scattering event. The plot ends at “+∞”, which is t = 100 a.u. here. In the ﬁnal
backward propagation the electrons are independent of each other, i.e., their energies
do not change any more. Hence, we do not show this part of the trajectory in ﬁgure
1.

The target electrons were started in a symmetric conﬁguration for the trajectory
of ﬁgure 1. Within less than one period one of them is kicked into a large orbit,

from which it returns after about 50 a.u. and kicks out the other electron. After the
propagation is reversed it is clearly seen that for most of the now following forward
propagation the energies of the target electrons “rewind” the backward propagation,
i.e., the broken lines are symmetric with respect to t = −100 a.u. In other cases (not
shown here) one of the electrons is even kicked out of the atom to a positive energy and
only comes back due to the reversed propagation. The projectile’s energy of Ep = 2
keV = 73.5 a.u. is shifted in the plot by Ep − (IP1 + IP2), i.e., the projectile is plotted
to start at the negative energy of the target. Ep is constant during the backward and
most of the forward propagation. It only starts to change shortly before t = 0, when
the interaction with the target electrons increases. Then the symmetry of the target
electron energy trajectories against t = −100 a.u.
is broken and all three electron–
electron interactions together determine the dynamics of the actual ionization event.
In this plot both electrons are lifted to positive energies, i.e., double ionization occurs.
Another diﬃculty in the classical description arises from the fact that the ﬁnal
state is normally of well deﬁned energy. Since the Hamiltonian is conservative only
that part of the initial Wigner distribution contributes which lies on this energy
shell. Consequently, the quantum distribution character of the initial state is lost.
To overcome this problem we proposed in [5] to evaluate the cross sections in terms of
the energy transfer, which, for hydrogen targets, is equivalent to looking at only the
projectile’s energy.

With the helium target a trajectory contributes to double ionization, when the
projectile’s energy loss ∆Ep is bigger than the sum of the ionization potentials IP1
and IP2 of the target and when both the target electrons have gained at least half of
the total binding energy:

− ∆Ep > IP1 + IP2

and ∆E1, ∆E2 >

IP1 + IP2
2

A contribution to single ionization is consequently deﬁned by

− ∆Ep > IP1, ∆E1 >

and ∆E2 <

IP1 + IP2
2

IP1 + IP2
2

.

Of course, this test has to be performed with the target electrons’ energy transfers
∆E1 and ∆E2 swapped, too.

To verify the conditions (2) and (3) for double and single ionization we need the
initial and the corresponding ﬁnal state wave functions. The initial state is the same
in all cases. We are therefore, as in the experiment, able to extract all physically
feasible cross sections from the same set of ﬁnal values of the propagated trajectories.
As a ﬁrst test of the performance and consistency of our approach with the helium
target we calculated the absolute total cross sections σ(1) for single and σ(2) for double
ionization. They are compared to absolute measurements by Shah et al [9] in ﬁgure
2.

For this ﬁrst calculation we have used a simple initial distribution obtained from

a product wave function for the ground state of the helium target

ψ(r1, r2) =

exp(− ˜Zr1) exp(− ˜Zr2)

16 [10]. Each of the single electron wave functions
is then translated into a phase space distribution by multiplying its densities in
coordinate and momentum space [8]. Both the wave function (4) and the resulting
phase space distribution have a total energy of E = −2.85 a.u., slightly less than the
experimental value of −2.904 a.u.

[9] (open and ﬁlled circles).

The single ionization cross section σ(1) reproduces the measured data on the level
of accuracy that is typical for a single electron CTMC calculation, see, e.g., [3]: the
maximum occurs at a lower energy and is slightly higher than the experiment, while
the high energy behavior follows the classical 1/E decay [11]. The explicit treatment
of both target electrons and of all interactions can, of course, not reintroduce quantum
eﬀects like tunneling. On the other hand the accessible phase space volume is much
bigger than with only one active electron and one might fear that the dynamics “strays
away” from the reaction path of single ionization, completely distorting the cross
section — which obviously does not happen. In fact our result is in good agreement
with an nCTMC calculation by Schultz et al [3].

The more interesting result is, of course, the double ionization cross section
σ(2): ﬁgure 2 shows the ﬁrst classical trajectory result ever, in which the dynamics
according to the correct full Hamiltonian without any modiﬁcations or additions was
solved – simultaneously both for σ(1) and σ(2). The double ionization cross section
has two regions of diﬀerent correspondence with the experiment: for high energies it
decays as 1/E2, much faster than the experimental data. This suggests that in our
calculation in the high energy regime both electrons are ionized independently, each
contributing a classical factor of 1/E, and not in a sequential event, which should
decay approximately as σ(1) [12]. For impact energies below 250 eV, on the other
hand, the experiment is reproduced remarkably well, both in shape and in magnitude.
In that region no microscopic quantum mechanical explanation has been proposed yet.
It is known, though, that right above the threshold the ﬁnal state is deﬁned only by
the long range and long time dynamics of the outgoing electrons, which can be well
described classically [13, 14]. The good agreement between our classical result and
the measured data shows that up to a total energy of about twice the total binding
energy of the helium target the main reaction paths are the classical ones.

In this letter we have demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that electron impact
ionization of a two electron atom, i.e., helium, can be calculated within a classical
trajectory Monte–Carlo framework with the full, unmodiﬁed helium Hamiltonian.

This has been achieved with a quasiclassical Møller formalism: the propagation scheme
refocuses and stabilizes the autoionizing target. The total cross sections, extracted
from the energy transfer, compare well with the experiment to within the limitations
of the classical approximation.

The next, more demanding level of tests will be to compare the diﬀerential cross
sections to experimental results and ﬁnally to understand the dynamics of double
ionization in the low energy regime.

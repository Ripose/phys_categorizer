Ultracold collisions between Cs atoms and Cs2 dimers in the electronic ground state are observed
in an optically trapped gas of atoms and molecules. The Cs2 molecules are formed in the triplet

Inelastic atom-molecule collisions converting internal excitation into kinetic energy lead to a loss of
Cs2 molecules from the dipole trap. Rate coeﬃcients are determined for collisions involving Cs atoms
in either the F=3 or F=4 hyperﬁne ground state and Cs2 molecules in either highly vibrationally
excited states (v′ = 33 − 48) or in low vibrational states (v′ = 4 − 6) of the a3Σ+
u triplet ground
state. The rate coeﬃcients β ∼ 10−10 cm3/s are found to be largely independent of the vibrational
and rotational excitation indicating unitary limited cross sections.

At very low temperatures the elastic and inelastic scat-
tering of particles is governed by quantum mechanical ef-
fects like resonances or tunneling through barriers, since
the deBroglie wavelength becomes comparable to the
range of the interparticle interactions. With the advent of
laser cooling techniques, ultracold atom-atom collisions
have been studied intensively both experimentally and
theoretically. Their understanding and control has been
decisive for the rapid development of the ﬁeld of quan-
tum gases [1]. As a prominent example, the competi-
tion between elastic and inelastic collisions of trapped
atoms determines the success of evaporative cooling for
achieving atomic Bose-Einstein condensation [2]. Since
recently, the focus has been moving from pure atomic
to ultracold atom-molecule and molecule-molecule colli-
sions, which are highly relevant for the formation and
stability of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates [3, 4].
The investigation of atom-molecule scattering at very low
temperatures forms the basis of the new emerging ﬁeld
Ultracold Chemistry [5].

Theoretical studies show that ultracold atom-molecule
collisions do not “freeze-out” at low temperatures, as
classical Langevin capture theory predicts, but feature
instead signiﬁcant rate coeﬃcients at ultralow temper-
atures where only a few partial waves contribute [6, 7,
8, 9, 10]. The energy dependence of cross sections at
low temperatures is predicted to be in good agreement
with the Wigner threshold law [8, 9, 10]. Up to now
these calculations are based on single potential energy
surfaces. However, coupling of several low lying poten-
tials through conical intersections can lead to additional
features in the rate coeﬃcients through shape and Fesh-
bach resonances [11]. Since the collision energy is much
smaller than the energy spacing between internal states
in the colliding atoms and molecules, the only inelas-
tic processes to occur are collisional deexcitation and,
for non-identical atoms, reactive scattering followed by
chemical rearrangement. At room temperature, the en-

ergy transfer from molecular vibration to translation and
rotation is suppressed when the vibrational level spac-
ings are large compared to the translational temperature,
i.e., the probability for deexcitation per collision is much
In contrast, below 10−3 K
smaller than unity [12, 13].
Refs. [8, 9, 10] show that the inelastic rate coeﬃcient
for lithium, sodium and potassium atom-diatom colli-
sions is higher than the elastic rate coeﬃcient and does
not depend on temperature, again in agreement with the
Wigner threshold law. In Refs. [6, 7] the inelastic col-
lision rate coeﬃcient for He-H2 and H-H2 collisions is
found to strongly increase with the vibrational quantum
number. On the other hand Stwalley [14] has recently
argued that molecules in the highest vibrational levels
near the dissociation threshold should feature very small
inelastic collision rates since they spend most of their
time at large internuclear distances where the overlap
with lower lying vibrational states is small. In addition
to vibrational excitation, rotational quantum states may
have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the rate of inelastic colli-
sions, e.g., due to quasi-resonant exchange of rotational
and vibrational energy [15]. Clearly, experimental inves-
tigations are needed to reveal the collisional behaviour
of molecules at ultralow temperatures and to test quan-
tum scattering calculations in the interesting transition
region from the Wigner threshold regime to the Langevin
regime.

Few experimental studies on ultracold atom-molecule
collisions have been carried out so far, the possibilities be-
ing limited by the diﬃculty to produce and trap ultracold
molecules simultaneously with cold atoms at suﬃciently
high densities. Successful storage of ultracold molecules
has ﬁrst been shown in an optical dipole trap [16] and
recently in magnetic traps [17]. Cold collisions at a tem-
perature of T ∼ 0.5 K have been studied between He
buﬀer gas cooled CaF and He [18]. For ultracold Na2
molecules formed through a Feshbach resonance, collision
rate coeﬃcients were determined for both atom-molecule

and molecule-molecule collisions [19]. Similarly ultracold
molecule-molecule collisions were observed for Cs2 and
a strong loss rate due to Feshbach-like resonances was
observed [20]. These two experiments at ultralow tem-
peratures probe molecules in the last bound vibrational
level.

Here we present an experimental study of ultracold
atom-molecule collisions involving molecules in deeply
bound vibrational states. Cs ground state atoms and
photoassociated Cs2 molecules are stored together in an
optical dipole trap. Rate coeﬃcients are determined
for exoergic atom-molecule collisions, observed through
molecule loss, with Cs2 in high lying vibrational levels
(v′ = 33 − 48, bound by 1-24 cm−1) and in low lying
levels (v′ = 4 − 6, bound by 175-195 cm−1) in the a3Σ+
triplet ground state [21, 22]. We ﬁnd for molecules in high
lying and low lying states equally large rate coeﬃcients,
larger than the s-wave scattering limit. The inelastic rate
coeﬃcients for diﬀerent Cs2 rotational states coincide,
which indicates that vibrational deexcitation dominates
over rotational deexcitation in the collision. A signiﬁcant
increase in the deexcitation rate is found for collisions
with Cs atoms in the F=4 hyperﬁne level of the 2S1/2
ground state as compared to Cs(F=3).

The measurements proceed as follows. An optical
dipole trap, formed by the focus of a 120 W CO2 laser
(Synrad Evolution 100, waist ∼ 90 µm) is loaded with
Cs(F=3) atoms from a magneto-optical trap (MOT).
We transfer Nat ∼ 2 × 105 Cs atoms into the dipole
trap with a shot-to-shot variation of less than 5% at
a typical density of nat = 1011 cm−3 and temperature
T = 60 ± 20 µK. The atom density is determined and the
temperature estimated from a measurement of the decay
of F=4 atoms due to hyperﬁne-changing collisions [23]
and atom-background gas collisions. The atoms are then
optically pumped to F=4 and about 5% of the atoms are
transformed into molecules by photoassociation [24] with
a cw Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent MBR110) applied with
intensity ∼ 600 W/cm2. After 100 ms of photoassociation
an equilibrium between formation and collision induced
loss has been reached, resulting in ∼ 5000 molecules in
the trap. Their temperature is estimated to be approxi-
mately equal to the atom temperature, i.e., 60 µK. Sub-
sequently, the remaining atoms can be either optically
pumped to the F=3 hyperﬁne state (> 99% eﬃciency
with negligible atom loss), be pushed out of the trap
with a resonant laser beam (> 99% eﬃciency) or be left
in the F=4 state. By measuring the number of trapped
molecules Nmol as a function of storage time τ we de-
duce the inelastic collision rate coeﬃcient. Each measure-
ment of Nmol(τ ) is an average over typically 48 cycles.
Nmol(τ = 0) is determined before and after each mea-
surement to correct for drifts in the experiment, mainly
small frequency drifts of the photoassocation laser. The
error bars of the detected molecule number combine the
corresponding statistical and correction uncertainties.

FIG. 1: Storage time measurement for Cs2(v′

molecules with Cs(F=3) atoms in the dipole trap at a den-
−3 (black ﬁlled
sity of nat = 9.1 ± 0.4stat ± 2.4sys × 1010 cm
squares) and with only molecules in the trap (circles). The
lines represent ﬁts to an exponential decay. Inset: Time-of-
ﬂight spectrum showing the Cs+ and Cs+

2 signals.

The molecules are detected via resonance-enhanced
two-photon ionization using an unfocused pulsed dye
laser beam (Radiant Dyes Narrowscan, ∼ 10 mJ per
pulse, wavelength 712.5 nm and linewidth< 0.1 cm−1).
The Cs+
2 ions are measured with a high resolution time-
of-ﬂight mass spectrometer [25]. The number of detected
molecules, calibrated from the signal of individual Cs+
2
ions, is smaller than the number of trapped molecules due
to the combined eﬃciencies of the ionization (10%) and
detection (20%) [26]. This calibration does not inﬂuence
the measured rate coeﬃcients, which only depend on the
relative intensity of the molecular signal. Ground state
atoms can only be ionized by three-photon ionization.
Therefore, the Cs+ signal is suppressed as compared to
the Cs+

2 signal (see inset of Fig. 1).

The preparation of Cs2 molecules in either high or low
lying levels of the triplet ground state is performed by
photoassociation through the v = 6 or v = 79 states,
respectively, of the outer well of the 0−
g ( 2P3/2) poten-
tial [27]. The v = 6 state decays primarily to the states
v′ = 33 − 48, whereas for v = 79 mainly the low ly-
ing states v′ = 4 − 6 are populated [21, 22].
In the
0−
g (v = 6) state the rotational states are resolved and
hence molecules can be formed in the a3Σ+
u state in
(v′, J ′ = 1) and (v′, J ′ = J, J ± 1) when J = 0 and
J 6= 0, respectively (|J − J ′| = 0, 1; J = 0 9 J ′ = 0). In
Fig. 1 we show examples of storage time measurements
of Cs2(v′ = 33 − 48) molecules with and without atoms
in the trap.
In the presence of atoms at a density of
9.1 ± 0.4stat ± 2.4sys × 1010 cm−3 the molecule storage
time is reduced by a factor of 7 as compared to molecule
storage without atoms, a clear indication of collision in-
duced loss.

The collision induced molecule loss can be due to vibra-
tional and rotational deexcitation of the molecules as well

as a change of the molecular or atomic hyperﬁne ground
state (for Cs in F=4). In all cases the released energy
largely exceeds the trap depth of ∼ 2 mK for molecules
and ∼ 1 mK for atoms and hence both collision partners
are lost from the trap with practically unity probability.
Since the number of atoms Nat is much larger than Nmol,
the evolution of Nmol can be described by a simple rate
equation

˙Nmol = −[βnat(t) + Γmol]Nmol,

(1)

where β is the atom-molecule inelastic collision rate coef-
ﬁcient, Γmol is the decay rate due to molecule-background
gas collisions and nat is weakly time-dependent due to
hyperﬁne-changing collisions (for Cs(F=4)) and collisions
of atoms with background gas. This equation is strictly
valid only for a single internal quantum state of the
molecule, due to the general dependence of the rate coef-
ﬁcient on the quantum state. Therefore we eﬀectively ob-
tain rate coeﬃcients averaged over the populated quan-
tum states. Molecule-molecule collisions are neglected in
Eq. (1), because no signiﬁcant molecule-molecule colli-
son rate was observed when measuring the dependence
of the molecular storage time on the initial number of
molecules.

In the case of F=3 atoms, nat is constant since changes
due to atom-background gas collisions (storage time ∼
5 s) can be neglected over the relevant molecule storage
times. Thus, Nmol(t) is described by an exponential de-
cay with decay rate βnat+Γmol. In Fig. 2, this decay rate
is shown for Cs2(v′ = 33−48) as well as Cs2(v′ = 4−6) at
diﬀerent Cs(F=3) atom densities. The density is varied
by varying the MOT size before transfer into the dipole
trap and the ﬁnal detuning for cooling in optical mo-
lasses [24]. For nat = 0 all atoms are pushed out of
the trap after photoassociation. The loss rate follows
the expected linear dependence on atom density, thus
conﬁrming molecule loss due to atom-molecule collisions.
From ﬁtting a straight line the inelastic rate coeﬃcients
v′=33−48 = 1.48 ± 0.03stat ± 0.4sys × 10−10 cm3/s and
βF =3
v′=4−6 = 1.51 ± 0.11stat ± 0.4sys × 10−10 cm3/s are de-
βF =3
duced (the systematic error is due to the uncertainty on
nat).
Interestingly, these rate coeﬃcients show no de-
pendence on the Cs2 vibrational level, even though they
bridge many vibrational quantum numbers. This eﬀect
is further discussed below.

In order to investigate to which extent rotational de-
excitation contributes to the molecule loss, we performed
molecule storage time measurements for photoassocia-
tion via the rotational levels 0−
g (v = 6, J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
u (v′ =
thus populating diﬀerent rotational levels a3Σ+
33−48, J ′). If rotational deexcitation gave rise to a signif-
icant molecule loss we would expect a relatively low loss
u (v′ = 33 − 48, J ′ = 0) is populated, i.e.,
rate when a3Σ+
for photoassociation to J = 1. However, we consistently
ﬁnd the rate coeﬃcients for all rotational states J ′ to be
equal within our experimental error. Thus, we conclude

that the molecule loss is governed by vibrational deexci-
tation. Molecular hyperﬁne changing collision rates are
expected to be similar to atomic ones [23] and therefore
about an order of magnitude smaller.

In contrast to the ultracold atom-molecule collisions,
the collisions of the optically trapped molecules with the
background gas at 300 K do depend on the vibrational
state, as seen in the loss rates Γmol(v′ = 33 − 48) =
1.9(2) s−1 and Γmol(v′ = 4 − 6) = 1.0(3) s−1 deduced
from the ﬁt. The faster loss for the higher vibrational
levels may be attributed either to a larger geometric
cross section for elastic collisions due to the larger av-
erage bond length or to the energetically open channel of
collision induced dissociation (binding energy ∼ 10 cm−1
for v′ = 33 − 48 compared to ∼ 185 cm−1 for v′ = 4 − 6).
In either case, this observation shows that the molecules
are indeed selectively formed in either high lying or low
lying vibrational states of the triplet ground state.

When molecules are stored with Cs(F=4) atoms, a
time dependence of the atomic density has to be in-
cluded due to hyperﬁne-changing atom-atom collisions
(see Eq.(7) of Ref. [23]). Solving Eq. (1) we ﬁnd

Nmol(t) = Nmol(0)e

−Γmolt[1 + 7Gnat(0)t/2]

−2β/7G, (2)

where G = 1.1 ± 0.3 × 10−11 cm3/s is the rate coeﬃ-
cient for hyperﬁne-changing collisions between Cs(F=4)
atoms. Fig. 3 shows a storage time measurement of
Cs2(v′ = 33 − 48) dimers together with a ﬁt to Eq. (2).
Several measurements at diﬀerent atomic densities yield
ﬁtted rate coeﬃcients independent of atom density as
expected for atom-molecule collisions. Their average is
v′=33−48 = 2.13 ± 0.06stat ± 0.6sys × 10−10 cm3/s. This
βF =4
rate coeﬃcient is larger than βF =3
v′=33−48, which can be
attributed to the additional loss channel of hyperﬁne-
changing collisions [23].

The measured rate coeﬃcients are quite close to the
ones predicted for Na − Na2 and K − K2 collisions [9, 10]

in Ref. [19] for Na2 formed via a Feshbach resonance.
We do not, however, observe a strong increase of the
inelastic rate coeﬃcient with the vibrational quantum
number, as predicted, e.g., for He-H2 collisions [6]. It is
illustrative to compare the measured inelastic rate coeﬃ-
cients to the inelastic s-wave collision limit, < σ(0)v >∼
p2π~4/(µ3kBT ), where σ(0) = π/k2 is the s-wave limit
of the scattering cross section, ~k the relative particle
momentum, v the relative particle velocity, µ the re-
duced mass and < .. > indicates an average over a Boltz-
mann distribution. For collisions between Cs and Cs2 at
T = 60 µK we obtain 1.7 × 10−11 cm3/s, nine times less
than the measured rate coeﬃcients. Obviously, p-wave
as well as d-wave collisions play a signiﬁcant role in the
collisions, whereas the estimated f-wave barrier height of
235 µK [8] prevents signiﬁcant f-wave contributions to the
rate coeﬃcient.

In conclusion, we have presented a quantitative exper-
imental study of ultracold atom-molecule collisions with
molecules in states well below the dissociation limit. We
have determined rate coeﬃcients for inelastic collisions
between molecules in various ro-vibrational states and
Cs(F=3) atoms and in one case also Cs(F=4) atoms at
temperatures around 60 µK. The inelastic collisions are
found to be governed by vibrational deexcitation and
show no dependence on the rotational quantum number.
The rate coeﬃcients are about nine times larger than
the s-wave scattering limit, showing that p-wave as well

containing a crossed dipole trap providing higher atomic
and thus molecular densities, it will be possible to also
study molecule-molecule collisions at ultralow tempera-
tures. Interesting future experiments will comprise colli-
sions and ultracold exchange reactions with mixed alkali
species in an optical trap [28] and with molecules in a

single internal quantum state, particularly molecules in
v = 0 of the singlet or triplet ground state, which should
have signiﬁcantly longer trapping times due to the lack
of vibrationally inelastic collisions [29, 30]. With the
development of high-resolution state-selective detection
techniques, studies on state-to-state molecular reaction
dynamics and quantum chemistry at ultralow tempera-
tures seem to be within reach.

Ultra-cold collisions of spin-polarized 24Mg,40Ca, and 88Sr in the metastable 3P2 excited state are
investigated. We calculate the long-range interaction potentials and estimate the scattering length
and the collisional loss rate as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. The estimates are based on molecular
potentials between 3P2 alkaline-earth atoms obtained from ab initio atomic and molecular structure
calculations. The scattering lengths show resonance behavior due to the appearance of a molecular
bound state in a purely long-range interaction potential and are positive for magnetic ﬁelds below
50 mT. A loss-rate model shows that losses should be smallest near zero magnetic ﬁeld and for ﬁelds
slightly larger than the resonance ﬁeld, where the scattering length is also positive.

Exploring ultracold collision physics with metastable
(nsnp)3P2 alkaline-earth atoms [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] promises
insights that complement those obtained from the more
conventional atomic species used in laser cooling. Unlike
alkali-metal atoms [6, 7] the most-common alkaline-earth
atoms have no nuclear spin, which greatly simpliﬁes a
theoretical description[8]. Furthermore, in contrast to
metastable noble-gas collisions[9] the low electronic en-
ergy of the alkaline-earth metastable states ensures the
absence of collisionally induced Penning or associative
ionization.

Atomic collisions in the ultracold regime play a crucial
role on the road toward quantum degenerate gases. We
show here that polarized metastable (nsnp)3P2 alkaline
earth systems with projection m = 2 along the magnetic
ﬁeld might satisfy the key requirements for this quest: a
positive scattering length and a favorable ratio of elas-
tic to inelastic collision rates for certain magnetic ﬁeld
strengths. In addition, we show how a new type of pure
long range molecular states can allow the resonant mag-
netic ﬁeld control of the scattering length. These states
arise due to an interplay of an anisotropic (quadrupole)
interaction and the magnetic ﬁeld. Similar anisotropy
has been predicted to exist for polar molecule collisions in
an electric ﬁeld[10]. Many-body systems with anistropic
interactions might now be explored[11].

Trapping of metastable alkaline-earths in magneto-
optical [2, 3, 4, 5] and magnetic traps [2, 3, 4, 12] has been
demonstrated. A ∼1 s magnetic trap lifetime for densities
near 1010 atoms/cm3 is observed with metastable 88Sr in
experiments at Rice and Tokyo university[3, 13]. These
trap lifetimes are limited by background collisions rather
than by the radiative lifetime, which is on the order of
minutes[1].

Molecular potentials — We have calculated short-range
adiabatic potentials correlating to two 3P2 atoms using a
molecular ab initio relativistic valence bond method, as
previously described[14]. A variety of attractive and re-

pulsive potentials, and a number of short-range avoided
crossings appear among them. Strong collisional loss pro-
cesses are likely [8] if the atoms approach one another
on the attractive curves. The section below shows how
a magnetic ﬁeld can be used to manipulate long-range
properties in such a way as to create pure long-range
molecular states and prevent some of these losses.

(See for examle Ref. [1].).

Magnetic ﬁeld — A magnetic ﬁeld B modiﬁes the long-
range interaction of two metastable alkaline-earth atoms
profoundly. For each atom α the approximate Zeeman
Hamiltonian HZα = µB (jα + sα) · B has been added to
the other terms in the molecular Hamiltonian. Here, sα
is the electron spin of atom α, µB is the Bohr magneton,
and we have assumed that the atomic gyromagnetic ratio
of the electron orbital angular momentum and spin are
one and two, respectively. The magnetic ﬁeld lifts the
degeneracy with respect to the projection mα of jα along
the space-ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld direction. Forces due to the
interatomic interaction break this space-ﬁxed quantiza-
tion, and align the molecular angular momentum along
the internuclear axis. This results in loss of polarization
of the angular momentum.

The long-range adiabatic molecular potentials in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld are found by diagonalizing
HZ1+HZ2+Hlr within the 3P2+3P2 product basis. These
potentials U (R, θB) not only depend on the ﬁeld strength
but also on the angle θB between the internuclear axis
and B. Figure 1 shows all Sr2 gerade adiabatic potentials
for a 10 mT ﬁeld and θB = 45◦. The nine dissociation
limits are separated by about E/kB =10 mK and are
labeled by M = m1 + m2, where M = +4(−4) for the
highest(lowest) dissociation limit. kB is the Boltzmann
constant.

Figure 1 shows a multitude of avoided crossings for in-
ternuclear separations where the Zeeman splitting is com-
parable to the quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, that
is, avoided crossings appear for R ≈ RB ≡ 5
Q2/(µBB).

For R ≫ RB, U4 is largest and is dominated by the QQ

are appreciable, while for R <

dominates. The inset of Fig. 3 shows that U0(R) has a
shallow attractive region for large R, that becomes deeper

Zeeman and anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole interac-
tions.

Scattering lengths — A rigorous description of elas-
tic collisions between spin polarized metastable 3P j =
2, m = 2 atoms should start from B = 0 theories[19]
and extend those to include the Zeeman interaction[7].
Such a model is beyond the scope of this paper.
In-
stead, we take advantage of our understanding of the
adiabatic potentials in a magnetic ﬁeld. Nuclear mo-
tion couples the electronic potentials via so-called non-
adiabatic couplings. These couplings are strongest near
avoided crossings between adiabatic electronic potentials
and lead to inelastic losses. For example, a transition
from the M = 4 to M = 3 curves in Fig. 1 results in de-
polarization and conversion of internal energy to kinetic
energy.

First we will assume that adiabaticity holds. We relax
this assumption below. The zero-energy s-wave (l = 0)
scattering length of polarized metastable 3P2 m = 2
atoms is then given by the scattering length of the U0(R)

component of U2,2 (R, θB). This length for three alkaline-
earth species as a function of magnetic ﬁeld is shown
in Fig. 4. For B < 40 mT the scattering lengths are
large and positive and a Bose condensate would be sta-
ble against collapse. Uncertainties in QQ and DD coeﬃ-
cients do not change the picture signiﬁcantly.

For B > 70 mT the scattering lengths exhibit singu-
larities, where a is inﬁnite. These resonances are due the
appearance of the ﬁrst bound state in U0(R). The inset of
Fig. 3 shows that for increasing B the well becomes wider
and deeper, supporting an increasingly larger number of
bound states and thus extra resonances.

Magnetic ﬁeld control of the sign and magnitude of
the scattering length near the resonances appears likely
for these systems. Magnetic ﬁeld-induced resonance be-
havior in scattering lengths has been observed for alkali-
metal atoms. There, however, the singularity is a conse-
quence of Feshbach resonances rather than through the
appearance of extra bound states in an adiabatic poten-
tial.

Inelastic processes — The scattering lengths have been
determined assuming that nonadiabatic couplings and
thus losses are negligible. We verify the applicability
of the adiabatic approximation by estimating loss rates
from a two-channel curve-crossing model. The model
has an attractive van-der-Waals potential in an incom-
ing channel, |ii, of two spin polarized atoms and l = 0
that crosses a repulsive C5/R5 exit channel, |ei, of two
atoms with m1+m2 < 4 and l = 4. The coupling, C′
5/R5,
is due to the QQ interaction. More precisely,

The R-dependent eigenvalues of V2ch are our model
adiabatic potentials. In fact, the top-most adiabat plays
the role of the L = 0 component of the U22 adiabat. It
has an attractive van der Waals tail and a repulsive wall
that is to be compared to the “Zeeman-van der Waals”
well of Fig. 3.

Loss can occur when the atoms reach short-range R on
the incoming channel or when the atoms are reﬂected into
the repulsive exit channel. We numerically solved the
two coupled Schr¨odinger equations assuming a hard-wall
placed inside RB and parameter values valid for stron-
tium. This approach has no losses due to short-range
inelastic processes. Nevertheless, we feel that the model
gives an order of magnitude estimate of the loss rate.
The calculations show that for B from 1 mT to 5 mT
the loss rate K into the exit channel rapidly rises from
∼ 10−13 cm3/s to 10−11 cm3/s due to Wigner-threshold
eﬀects in the exit channel. For large ﬁelds the rate de-
creases slowly and exponentially with B and for B ≈ 500
mT has dropped to 10−12 cm3/s.

The loss rate and the scattering length show a reso-
nance similar to the resonances shown in Fig. 4 when an
extra bound state appears in the upper adiabat. For col-
lision energies below 1 µK the loss rate approaches zero
in a narrow ≈ 1 mT region above the resonance location
where the scattering length is large and positive. For col-
lision energies above 100 µK the resonance is broadened
and will be hard to observe. The position of the reso-
nance and the corresponding loss rate will change when
all coupled channels are included. However, the reso-
nance and a (partial) drop in the loss rate is expected to
survive.

4

Consequently, we have identiﬁed magnetic ﬁeld regions
where losses are smaller than or on the order of 10−13
cm3/s, i.e. for B < 1 mT and for magnetic ﬁeld strengths
just above the resonance. For several Tesla ﬁelds the
loss rate will be small as well. At a rate constant of
10−13 cm3/s the imaginary part of the scattering length
hK/(2µ)[20], is orders of magnitude smaller than the real
part of the scattering length shown in Fig. 4. The colli-
sion is adiabatic for these ﬁeld regions and the scattering
length is meaningful. Moreover, these rates lead to sam-
ple lifetimes of 1 s at densities of 1013 cm−3.

Conclusion — We have calculated the interaction po-
tentials of metastable alkaline-earth dimers in the pres-
ence of a magnetic ﬁeld. A purely long-range interaction
potential is found to determine the scattering length be-
tween two spin polarized 3P2 alkaline-earth atoms. A
magnetic-ﬁeld-induced resonance is observed, where the
interaction potential supports an extra bound state. Ref-
erence [10] predicts similar long-range states for polar
molecules in an electric ﬁeld. Existence of such molecu-
lar states should be a general property of colliding atoms
or molecules with an anisotropic interaction potential in
an external ﬁeld that split a degeneracy.

Although full-scale multi-channel calculations of mag-
netic trap losses and scattering lengths are desirable, a
two channel model indicates that the inelastic loss rate of
the collision between two spin polarized atoms are small
for small magnetic ﬁeld strengths and above the ﬁeld-
induced resonance, where the scattering length is posi-
tive. We uncovered several unique features of collisions
between metastable alkaline-earths, which may oﬀer new
insights into the physics of ultracold quantum gasses.

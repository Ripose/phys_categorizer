We demonstrate a technique to measure hyperﬁne structure using a frequency-stabilized diode
laser and an acousto-optic modulator locked to the frequency diﬀerence between two hyperﬁne
peaks. We use this technique to measure hyperﬁne intervals in the 5P3/2 state of 85Rb and obtain a
precision of 20 kHz. We extract values for the magnetic-dipole coupling constant A = 25.038(5) MHz
and the electric-quadrupole coupling constant B = 26.011(22) MHz. These values are a signiﬁcant
improvement over previous results.

The use of tunable diode lasers has revolutionized the
ﬁeld of atomic physics [1] and particularly laser spec-
troscopy. The D-lines of most alkali atoms can be conve-
niently accessed using diode lasers. Therefore, they have
been used extensively on alkali atoms as tools for pump-
probe spectroscopy, optical-pumping experiments, quan-
tum optics, and the study of three-level systems. They
ﬁnd widespread use in experiments on laser cooling and
Bose-Einstein condensation of alkali atoms. They have
also been proposed as potential low-cost alternatives for
optical-frequency standards [2]. We have been exploring
the use of diode lasers for precise measurements of hyper-
ﬁne intervals in the excited state of alkali atoms. Precise
knowledge of hyperﬁne intervals provides valuable infor-
mation about the structure of the nucleus (nuclear defor-
mation) and its inﬂuence on atomic wavefunctions [3, 4].
The exact knowledge of atomic wavefunctions is partic-
ularly important in alkali atoms because of their use in
experiments such as atomic signatures of parity violation
[5].

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a single diode
laser and an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) for precise
hyperﬁne-structure measurements in the excited state of
Rb. In our technique, the laser is ﬁrst locked to a given
hyperﬁne transition. The laser frequency is then shifted
using the AOM to another hyperﬁne transition and the
AOM frequency is locked to this frequency diﬀerence.
Thus the AOM frequency directly gives a measurement
of the hyperﬁne interval. We demonstrate a precision of
20 kHz in the measurement of the intervals in Rb. Other
techniques [3] such as level crossing, double resonance, or
using stabilized Fabry-Perot cavities have accuracy lim-
ited to the MHz level. So far, the most precise hyper-
ﬁne measurements have been done in the 5P3/2 state of
87Rb by Ye et al. [2]. In their method, two ultra-stable
Ti-sapphire lasers are locked to diﬀerent hyperﬁne peaks
with an accuracy of 1/2000th of the line center. The beat
frequency of the two lasers is measured on a fast photo-
diode to obtain the hyperﬁne interval with a precision of
10 kHz. The stability of the laser lock in our technique

is only of order 1/20th of the line center, but we are
still able to achieve high precision because the two laser
beams are derived from the same laser and their ﬂuctua-
tions are correlated. Indeed, if we could lock the laser to
1/2000th of the line center, we believe our technique can
be pushed below the kHz level.

The schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1.
The output of the frequency-stabilized diode laser is split
into two parts. One part goes into a Rb saturated-
absorption spectrometer (SAS1). The output from this
spectrometer is used to lock the laser to a given hyper-
ﬁne transition of the D2 line (5S1/2 ↔ 5P3/2 transitions).
The second part goes into an AOM, where the frequency
gets shifted, and then the shifted beam goes to a second
Rb saturated-absorption spectrometer (SAS2). The fre-
quency shift is adjusted so that the shifted beam is on
a neighboring hyperﬁne transition. The output from the
spectrometer is demodulated and fed back to the voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) of the AOM driver. Thus, the
servo loop locks the AOM frequency to the frequency dif-
ference between the two hyperﬁne transitions. The AOM
frequency, and hence the hyperﬁne interval, is read using
a frequency counter.

The laser is a standard external-cavity diode laser sta-
bilized using optical feedback from a piezo-mounted grat-
ing [6, 7]. The r.m.s. linewidth of the laser after stabi-

lization is measured to be below 500 kHz. The AOM pro-
duces variable frequency shifts in the range of 75 MHz
to 135 MHz, which covers almost all the intervals in the
Rb D2 line. The AOM frequency is measured using a
frequency counter whose internal clock is phase locked to
a quartz oscillator with a stability of 5 ppm. This sta-
bility corresponds to a maximum error of 600 Hz in the
measured intervals, which is about two orders of mag-
nitude smaller than the accuracy reported in this work.
The intensities of the pump and probe in the saturated-
absorption spectrometer are carefully adjusted (to a ratio
of about 3) to avoid optical-pumping eﬀects and the eﬀect
of velocity redistribution of the atoms in the vapor cell
from radiation pressure [8]. Such eﬀects manifest them-
selves as inversion of hyperﬁne peaks or distortion of the
Lorentzian lineshape. It is important to avoid these ef-
fects since they can lead to systematic shifts in the peak
position.

The error signals needed for locking are produced by
modulating the injection current into the diode laser at
a frequency of 18 kHz. The error signal is obtained
from the Doppler-subtracted saturated-absorption signal
by phase-sensitive detection at the third harmonic of the
modulation frequency [9]. This is known to produce nar-
row error signals that are free from eﬀects due to resid-
ual Doppler background or intensity ﬂuctuations. In Fig.
2, we show a typical third-harmonic error signal as the
laser is scanned across the F = 3 → F ′ transitions of
the D2 line in 85Rb. The various hyperﬁne components
are clearly resolved and labeled according to the value
of F ′. Crossover resonances that occur exactly half-way
between two hyperﬁne peaks are labeled with the two
values of F ′ in brackets. The depth of modulation of the
laser is adjusted to get such sharp error signal with good
signal to noise ratio.

In order to test the reliability of this technique, we
have ﬁrst measured hyperﬁne intervals in the 5P3/2 state

of 87Rb. These intervals are already known with an accu-
racy below 10 kHz from the work of Ye et al. [2]. There-
fore, the measurement acts as a good check on our error
budget. In Fig. 3, we compare our values with the val-
ues reported by Ye et al. The values overlap very well at
the 1σ level, though our error bars are larger. The error
quoted is the sum of the statistical and systematic errors,
which is 30 kHz for these measurements. For two inter-
vals, the error is doubled to 60 kHz because we measure
only half the interval (using crossover resonances).

With the conﬁdence from the above measurements in
87Rb, we have proceeded to measure hyperﬁne intervals
in 85Rb. The intervals and their measured values are
listed in Table I. The 5P3/2 state has four hyperﬁne lev-
els, and thus has only three independent intervals. There-
fore, the ﬁve measurements listed in Table I can be com-
bined in diﬀerent ways to calculate the three intervals.
For example, measurements 3 and 4 are two independent
measurements of the same {F = 4} − {F = 2} interval,
but using diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions. The consistency
of these two values within the error bars acts as a further
check on our error budget. Similarly, the other values
have been checked for internal consistency in the deter-
mination of the intervals. The values of the three inter-
vals are shown in Fig. 4a. Two of these intervals have
errors of about 30 kHz after propagating errors from the
measured intervals in Table I.

The dominant source of error in our measurement is
the error arising from ﬂuctuations in the lock point of
the laser. The gating time of the frequency counter is
limited to 10 s, and this results in statistical variation
in the measured values. With longer integration times,
we believe that this error can be reduced below the kHz

level. We have considered the following sources of sys-
tematic error and conclude that they are all within the
quoted errors. Systematic shifts of the hyperﬁne peaks
due to lineshape modiﬁcation in the saturated-absorption
spectrum (mentioned earlier) are checked by the inter-
nal consistency checks described above. Diﬀerent hyper-
ﬁne transitions have diﬀering eﬀects (e.g. due to optical
pumping) and suﬀer varying shifts. Similarly, the con-
sistency of our results for 87Rb with the results of Ye
et al. [2] check for these errors. Systematic errors could
arise from spectral line shifts due to background collisions
in the Rb vapor cells and magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneity
in the vicinity of the cells. At the vapor pressure in-
side the cell (corresponding to an atomic density of ∼109
atoms/cc), collisional shifts are estimated to be below 10
kHz. We have measured the magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogene-
ity to be below 10 µT. We have further veriﬁed that these
errors are negligible by repeating the measurements with

diﬀerent Rb vapor cells from diﬀerent manufacturers at
diﬀerent locations in the laboratory. The measurements
were repeated over a period of several months. We con-
clude that there are no unaccounted systematic errors at
this level of precision.

We have used the data in Table I to obtain the hyper-
ﬁne coupling constants in the 5P3/2 state of 85Rb. The
measured intervals are ﬁtted to the magnetic-dipole cou-
pling constant A and the electric-quadrupole coupling
constant B. This yields values of A = 25.038(5) MHz
and B = 26.011(22) MHz. In Fig. 4a, we show the good
agreement between the measured intervals and the inter-
vals calculated from the ﬁtted constants. In Fig. 4b, these
A and B values are compared to earlier values reported
by Arimondo et al. [3] and Barwood et al. [11]. The rec-
ommended values of Arimondo et al. are obtained from a
global ﬁt to all available spectroscopic data. Our value of
A just overlaps with this value, but with 4 times smaller
error. Our value of B has slightly smaller error, but the
overlap is only at the 2σ level. The more recent values
from Barwood et al. are consistent for A, but are quite
diﬀerent from both the recommended value for B, and
our result, suggesting the need for future measurements
with higher precision.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique
for measuring hyperﬁne intervals in alkali atoms using
a single frequency-stabilized diode laser. An acousto-
optic modulator locked to the frequency diﬀerence be-
tween two hyperﬁne transitions gives absolute frequency
calibration for the measurement. Using this technique,
we have demonstrated 20 kHz precision in the measure-
ment of hyperﬁne intervals in 85Rb. The statistical er-
ror is primarily limited by the gating interval of our fre-
quency counter and we hope to improve this in the future.
We also plan to reduce the linewidth of our diode lasers
below 10 kHz using optical feedback from a high-Q res-
onator [10]. The linewidth of the hyperﬁne peaks in the
saturated-absorption spectrometer is about 2 to 3 times
the natural linewidth and is probably limited by power
broadening and beam overlap in the cell. By reducing
the linewidth close to the natural linewidth, we hope to
achieve 3 kHz stability in the laser locking, similar to
what has been reported in Ref. [2]. This should enable
us to achieve sub-kHz precision for the intervals, which is
an unprecedented level of precision in the measurement
of hyperﬁne intervals of excited states.

Abstract. Calculation of higher-order two-loop corrections is now a limiting factor
in development of the bound state QED theory of the Lamb shift in the hydrogen
atom and in precision determination of the Rydberg constant. Progress in the study
of light hydrogen-like ions of helium and nitrogen can be helpful to investigate these
uncalculated terms experimentally. To do that it is necessary to develop a theory of
such ions. We present here a theoretical calculation for low energy levels of helium
and nitrogen ions.

1 Introduction

The Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) theory of simple atoms like hydrogen
or hydrogen-like ions provides precise predictions for diﬀerent energy levels
[1,2]. Particularly, some accurate results were obtained for the Lamb shift in
the ground state of the hydrogen atom. The accuracy of the QED calcula-
tions of the Lamb shift has been limited by unknown higher-order two-loop
corrections and inaccuracy of determination of the proton charge radius [3].
As far as the proton size is going to be determined very precisely from a new
experiment [4] on the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen, the only theoretical
uncertainty is now due to the two-loop contribution. Improvement of the the-
ory is important to determine the Rydberg constant with high accuracy [5,6]
and to test the bound state QED precisely.

Since the theory seems not to be able to give now any results on higher-
order two-loop corrections (α2(Zα)6m and higher) we have to look for another
way to estimate these terms and so the uncertainty of the hydrogen Lamb
shift theory. An opportunity is to study the problem experimentally, mea-
suring the Lamb shift in diﬀerent hydrogen-like ions at not too high value of
the nuclear charge Z. Only for two such ions the Lamb shift can be available
with a high accuracy from experiment at the present time or in the near fu-
ture. Namely, these are helium [7,8] and nitrogen [9] ions. The experimental
estimation of higher-order two-loop terms is quite of interest also because of
recent speculation on a great higher-order term [10] (see also Refs. [11,12]).
The advantage of using Z > 1 is determined by the scaling behaviour of

diﬀerent QED values:

• The scaling of the Lamb shift is Z 4;
• The scaling of the radiative line width of excited states (e. g. of the 2p

and 3s states) is Z 4 as well;

• The scaling of the unknown higher-order two-loop corrections to the

Lamb shift is Z 6.

Thus, relatively imprecise measurements with higher Z can nevertheless give
some quite accurate data on some QED corrections.

Our target is to develop a theory for the Lamb shift and the ﬁne structure
in these two atomic systems. Eventually we need to determine the 2s − 2p1/2
splitting in the helium ion (for comparison with the experiment [7]), diﬀerence
of the Lamb shifts EL(2s) − EL(3s) in 4He+ (for the project [8]) and the
2p3/2 − 2s interval in hydrogen-like nitrogen. The diﬀerence mentioned is
necessary [13,1] if one needs to compare the results of the Lamb shift (n = 2)
measurement [7] and the 2s − 3s experiment.

Since the uncertainty of the QED calculations is determined for these
two ions (He+ and N6+) by the higher-order two-loop terms, we are going
to reduce the other sources of uncertainty. We present results appropriate
to provide an interpretation of the experiments mentioned as a direct study
of the higher-order two loop corrections. The results of the ions experiments
should afterwards be useful for the hydrogen atom.

2 Theoretical contributions

2.1 Deﬁnitions and notation

The Lamb shift is deﬁned throughout the paper as a deviation from an un-
perturbed energy level1

E(0)(nlj) = mRhf (nj) − 1i −

m2
R

2(M + m)hf (nj) − 1i2

,

(1)

where M and m are the mass of the nucleus and of the electron, and mR
stands for the reduced mass. The dimensionless Dirac energy of the electron
in the external Coulomb ﬁeld is of the form

f (nj) =1 +

The Lamb shift is mainly a QED eﬀect, perturbed by the inﬂuence of the

nuclear structure

recoil contributions depending on the nuclear mass M

2.2 One-loop contributions: self energy of the electron

Let us start with the one-loop contribution. The terms of the external-ﬁeld
contribution are usually written in the form of an expansion

2.3 One-loop contributions: polarization of vacuum

The coeﬃcient of the expansion (7) for free vacuum polarization can be cal-
culated in any order of Zα in a closed analytic form [15]. In particular, the
result was found in Ref. [15] for the circular states (l = n−1) with j = l+1/2.
For n = 1, 2 one can expand at low Zα and ﬁnd

2.4 Wichmann-Kroll contributions

It is not enough to consider the free vacuum polarization. The relativistic
corrections to the free vacuum polarization in Eqs. (11–14) are of the same
order as the so-called Wichmann-Kroll term due to Coulomb eﬀects inside
the electronic vacuum-polarization loop. To estimate this term we ﬁtted its
numerical values from Ref. [18], which are more accurate for some higher
Z ∼ 30, by expression [18,17]

27(cid:19) + (Zα)3 (cid:18)A71 ln

1

(Zα)2 + A70(cid:19) .

(16)

We found that the contribution of A70 and A71 terms is small enough. The
accuracy of the calculation in Ref. [18] is not high at Z = 7 and we performed
some ﬁtting of higher Z data. To make a conservative estimate we ﬁnd two
pairs of coeﬃcients which reproduce the result at Z = 30. The results are:

A71(ns) = −0.23(2), A70(ns) = 0 and FW K (7) = 0.000 139(1) ;
A71(ns) = 0, A70(ns) = −0.07(1) and FW K (7) = 0.000 130(2) ,

where the uncertainty comes from inaccuracy of the numerical calculations
of FW K (30) = 0.0020 [18], which is estimated here as a value of a unit in the
last digital place. Comparing the results above one can ﬁnd a conservative
estimate: FW K (7) = 0.000 134(6). The value FW K (30) = 0.0020 is valid for
both the 1s and 2s states and we use this value for the 3s state as well. On
this level of accuracy (δFW K (30) ≃ 0.0001) there is no shift of the 2p levels
[18] and we use a zero value for them.

2.5 Fitting of one-loop self energy contributions

We separate from the expression for the self-energy part of the one-loop
correction (7) the function

G(Z) = A60 + hhigher-order termsi .

(17)

Using numerical values of A60 from Refs. [19,20] and ones of G(Z) from Refs.
[21,22], we performed several types of ﬁtting for these functions.

We started with ﬁtting (I) with function

A60 + (Zα)(cid:18)A71 ln

1

(Zα)2 + A70(cid:19) ,

(18)

minimizing the sum

XZ (eG(Z) −(cid:2)A60 + (Zα)(cid:0)A71 ln(cid:0)1/(Zα)2(cid:1) + A70(cid:1)(cid:3)

δG(Z)

)2

,

(19)

with respect to A70 and A71 for 1s state (where Z = 1 . . . 5) and to A70
for 2s state (where Z = 5, 10). In the latter case we used the fact that
A71(1s) = A71(2s). The statistical error of data

hδeG(Z)i2

70i2
= [δnumG(Z)]2 +hπ2(Zα)3A(0)

.

(20)

contains uncertainty of numerical integrations in Refs. [21,22] and of the ﬁt
in (17) due to neglecting of higher-order terms of absolute order α(Zα)8m
(where A(0)

70 is a result of preliminary ﬁtting with δeG = δnumeG ).

To estimate the additional systematic uncertainty which originates from
the unknown term of order α(Zα)7 we studied a sensitivity of the ﬁt (I) to
introduction of some perturbation function h(z)

The ﬁnal uncertainty of the ﬁt was calculated as a random sum of diﬀerences
of the ﬁts without function h and with h(Z) from the binomial expansion of
the expression

for the 1s and 2s states and

eG(Z) = G(Z) + h(Z) ,

(21)

(22)

(23)

for the 2p-states and for the diﬀerence G2s − Gns (see below).

The logarithm ln(cid:0)1/(Zα)2(cid:1) in the expansion (7) is a large value3 at very

low Z but it is quite a smooth function of Z around Z = 7 (see Table 1).
Due to that, we can also use a non-logarithmic ﬁtting function

G(Z0) + A(Z − Z0) +

B
2

(Z − Z0)2

(24)

with smooth behaviour at Z ∼ 7. In particular, we applied the Eq. (24) for
numerical data from Ref. [21,22] at Z = 3, 4, 5 with central value Z0 = 4 (ﬁt
II ) and Z = 5, 10, 15 with Z0 = 10 (ﬁt III ).

For the 2s state we also performed independent ﬁts for G1s and the dif-
ference G1s − G2s, ﬁnding G2s as their combination. Values of corresponding

for the diﬀerence G1s − G2s) and (VI) (both ﬁts for Z = 5, 10, 15). That can
be useful because data on the 1s state is more accurate [21,22], and in case
of diﬀerence the uncertainty is smaller (cf. Eqs. (22) and (23)) and one of
higher-order parameters is known (A71 = 0) [23,13].

Only few data are available for 3s [24] at Z = 10, 20, 30 . . . and we perform

two ﬁtting: ﬁt I with Z = 10, 20 and ﬁt III with Z = 10, 20, 30 at Z0 = 20.

Diﬀerent ﬁtting functions are plotted in Figs. 1–3 for n = 1, n = 2,
G1s − G2s and G2s − G3s. The points with error bars are for numerical values
obtained in Refs. [24,21,22].

The higher-order terms denoted as GII (Z) are not known. We expect [3]
that the magnitude of GII does not exceeded by half the value of the leading
logarithmic term (ln3(Zα) for the ns states and ln2(Zα) for the 2p states)
at Z = 1 and use the estimation for GII (1) for any Z. The purpose of this
calculation is to eliminate any other sources of theoretical uncertainty and to
study a value of GII

2s by a comparison with experiment.

The leading state-dependent term for the s-state is also known [33,13],

and in particular one can ﬁnd

Eq. (39) vanishes for the p states because their non-relativistic wave function
is vanishes at the origin itself. However, the small component of the Dirac
wave function contains a factor of σp/2m and the Dirac wave function is not
equal to zero at the origin. In particular, one can easily ﬁnd

3 Summary

All contributions and ﬁnal values of the Lamb shifts in the lowest states of
hydrog-like ions 4He+, 14N6+ and 15N6+ are presented in Tables 5, 6 and 7,
respectively. The ﬁnal results for intervals which can be measured are listed
in Table 8. The results in Table 8 involve three main sources of uncertainty
and we split the uncertainty there and in auxiliary Tables 5–7, respectively:

12

Vladimir G. Ivanov and Savely G. Karshenboim

• The higher-order two-loop corrections;
• Nuclear structure corrections (They require further study);
• Other theoretical QED uncertainties beyond the higher-oder two-loop

eﬀects.

The theory (with unknown higher-order two-loop eﬀects excluded ) is found to
be accurate enough and we hope the study of helium and nitrogen hydrogen-
like ions is a promising way to study in detail the two-loop contributions
experimentally.

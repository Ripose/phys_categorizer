Abstract

Ab initio calculation of the hyperﬁne, P -odd, and P, T -odd constants for the
YbF molecule was performed with the help of the recently developed tech-
nique, which allows to take into account correlations and polarization in the
outercore region. The ground state (2Σ1/2) electronic wave function of the
YbF molecule is found with the help of the Relativistic Eﬀective Core Poten-
tial method followed by the restoration of molecular four-component spinors in
the core region of ytterbium in the framework of a non-variational procedure.
Core polarization eﬀects are included with the help of the atomic Many Body
Perturbation Theory for Yb atom. For the isotropic hyperﬁne constant A, ac-
curacy of our calculation is about 3% as compared to the experimental datum.
The dipole constant Ad (which is much smaller in magnitude), though better
than in all previous calculations, is still underestimated by almost 23%. Being
corrected within a semiempirical approach for a perturbation of 4f -shell in
the core of Yb due to the bond making, this error is reduced to 8%. Our value
for the eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the unpaired electron is 4.9 a.u.=2.5 × 1010
V cm−1.

a. Introduction. A number of papers [1–5] were devoted to the calculations of the P, T -
odd interaction constants in the ground state 2Σ1/2 of YbF molecule. These calculations are
necessary for the interpretation of the ongoing experimental search for the Electric Dipole
Moment (EDM) of the electron de [6].
It is expected that in this experiment it will be
possible to put a more stringent bound on the EDM of the electron. However, in order
to link experimentally measured P, T -odd frequency shift with de, one needs to know an
eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the uncoupled electron, which is characterized by a constant Wd.
So, reliable calculations of this quantity are essential. The cited above calculations predict
the values of this constant in the interval (−0.62 ÷ −1.5) × 1025 Hz e−1 cm−1.

It is known, that parameter Wd is sensitive to the spin density in the vicinity of the
heavy nucleus (see, for example, [7]). The same, of course, can be said about magnetic
hyperﬁne constants. So, comparison of the calculated constants of the hyperﬁne structure
on the 171Yb nucleus with the experiment provides an important test of the quality of the
Wd calculation. In previous calculations [2,4] hyperﬁne constants were signiﬁcantly under-
estimated. In [2], it was concluded that the spin-correlation eﬀects of the unpaired electron
with the outermost core 5s- and 5p-shells of ytterbium should be taken into account in order
to perform more accurate calculations of the hyperﬁne and P, T -odd constants. After that
it was shown that 4f -shell can also contribute to the dipole part of the spin density [3]. In
unrestricted Dirac-Fock (DF) calculations by Parpia [5], the values for Wd are in a reason-
able (mutually consistent) agreement with our previous Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential
(RECP)-based [2] and semiempirical [1,3] calculations. Recently a new technique to account
for the most important types of the core-valence correlations and the core polarization eﬀects
with the help of the atomic Many Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) was developed and
proved to be very eﬃcient for the calculations of the hyperﬁne structure and P, T -odd eﬀects
for the BaF molecule [8]. Below we report the results of the application of this method to
calculation of the YbF molecule. The deviation of the calculated Ad from the experimental
value is analyzed and the ﬁnal Ad magnitude is corrected with the help of the semiempirical
procedure [3].

b. Spin-rotational Hamiltonian. For the 171Yb isotope, which has nuclear spin I =
1
2, the molecular spin-rotational degrees of freedom are described by the following spin-
rotational Hamiltonian (see [7]):

Hsr = BN2 + γSN − DenE + S ˆAI

+ WAkAn × S · I + (WSkS + Wdde)Sn.

(1)

In this expression N is the rotational angular momentum, B is the rotational constant, S
and I are the spins of the electron and the Yb nucleus, n is the unit vector directed along the
molecular axis from Yb to F. The spin-doubling constant γ characterizes the spin-rotational
interaction. De and E are the molecular dipole moment and the external electric ﬁeld.
The axial tensor ˆA describes magnetic hyperﬁne structure on the Yb nucleus. It can be
determined by two parameters: A = (Ak + 2A⊥)/3 and Ad = (Ak − A⊥)/3. The smaller
hyperﬁne structure associated with the 19F nucleus is neglected. The last three terms in (1)
account for the P - and P, T -odd eﬀects. First of them describes interaction of the electron
spin with the anapole moment of the nucleus kA [9]. The second one corresponds to the
scalar P, T -odd electron-nucleus interaction with the dimensionless constant kS. The third
one describes interaction of the electron EDM de with the internal molecular ﬁeld Emol:

These equations show that the constant 1
2 Wd characterizes an eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the
unpaired electron. Similar to the Wd, the other P - and P, T -odd constants Wi depend on
the electron spin-density in a vicinity of the heavy nucleus and reliability of their calculation
can be also tested by comparison of the calculated and experimental hyperﬁne constants.

c. Calculation scheme. The Generalized RECP or GRECP (see [10] and references)
calculation of the ground state 2Σ of YbF molecule was performed by analogy with [2].
The main diﬀerence of the present calculation is that the pseudospinors corresponding to
the 5s- and 5p-shells were frozen from the calculation of the Yb2+ ion with the help of
the level-shift technique (which is also known as Huzinaga-type ECP, see e.g. [11]). It was
necessary to freeze these pseudospinors, because polarization of the corresponding shells
was taken into account by means of the Eﬀective Operator (EO) technique (see [8] for
details). RASSCF [12] calculations with 5284 conﬁgurations were performed for 11 electrons
distributed in RAS-1=(2,0,0,0), RAS-2=(2,1,1,0), and RAS-3=(6,4,4,2) subspaces. The
discribed above procedure follows the same lines as the one used in our previous calculation
of BaF molecule [8].

The molecular relativistic spinor for the unpaired electron was constructed from the

so that the atomic s- and p-pseudoorbitals of ytterbium in (4) were replaced by the un-
smoothed four-component DF spinors derived for the same atomic conﬁgurations which
were used in generation of basis s- and p-pseudoorbitals. The MO LCAO coeﬃcients were
preserved after the RECP calculations. As the spin-orbit interaction for the unpaired elec-
tron is small, the “spin-averaged” valence atomic p-pseudoorbital was replaced by the linear
combination of the corresponding spinors with j = l ± 1/2 (see [2] for details).

e

EOs for the magnetic hyperﬁne interaction, for the EDM interaction (2) and for the
anapole moment interaction were constructed by means of the atomic MBPT. The EOs
include two most important correlation corrections, which involve all the core electrons. The
ﬁrst correction corresponds to the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), and the second
one corresponds to the substitution of the valence DF orbitals by the Brueckner orbitals.
The latter are found by solving the one-particle equations with the self-energy operator σ(ε)
added to the Dirac-Fock operator hDF:

(hDF + σ(εn)) φn = εnφn.

(5)

For the operator σ(ε) we used diagrammatic technique developed in [13]. In our calculations
of this operator we have neglected excitations from the shells 1s · · · 3d. Opposite to that,
in RPA equations it was important to include all the core electrons. Both RPA equations
and Brueckner equations were solved for a ﬁnite four-component basis set in the V N −2
approximation (which means that SCF corresponds to Yb2+), and matrix elements of the

EOs were calculated. The basis set included DF orbitals for 1s . . . 6s, 6p, 5d shells.
In
addition 7 − 18s, 7 − 18p, 6 − 17d, 5 − 17f and 5 − 14g orbitals were formed by analogy with
the basis set N2 of [13]. Molecular orbitals were reexpanded in this basis set to ﬁnd matrix
elements of EOs for the molecular wave function.

The main advantage of this method is that there is no need to extend the active (valence)
space in order to include core electrons. It is of particular importance when one is interested
in such molecular properties as hyperﬁne, P -odd, and P, T -odd constants. Corresponding
electronic operators are singular at the nucleus. For this reason, it is necessary to include
all the core electrons in RPA equations. Corresponding extension of the active space would
be extremely expensive. Another approach which allows core electrons to contribute to the
spin density is the unrestricted DF molecular calculation (where polarization is taken into
account [5]).

d. Results. Explicit expression for the parameter Wd is given in (2) and (3). Other
electronic matrix elements, which correspond to the parameters A, Ad and Wi of opera-
tor (1) can be found in [7]. All the radial integrals and atomic four-component spinors were
calculated for the ﬁnite nucleus 171Yb in a model of uniformly charged ball. It is well known,
that atomic matrix elements of operator (2) are proportional to Z 3. The same scaling is
applicable to the constant WS, while the matrix elements which contribute to the constants
WA are proportional to Z 2. As far as the nuclear charge of the ﬂuorine is 8 times smaller
than that of the ytterbium, we have neglected contributions to the Wi parameters from the
vicinity of the ﬂuorine nucleus. The additional argument which justiﬁes this approximation
is that the unpaired electron in the YbF molecule is mainly that of the Yb atom, and thus
the spin density is localized near the Yb atom. At present we do not have RPA program for
the scalar P, T -odd interaction, so we have focused here on the calculation of the constants
Wd and WA.

Results for the parameters of the spin-rotational Hamiltonian are given in table I. Com-
parison of the results of the GRECP/RASSCF calculation [2] with the results of the present
GRECP/RASSCF/EO calculation conﬁrms our previous conclusion that correlations (in-
cluding spin polarization) with the core give a signiﬁcant contribution to the hyperﬁne
structure and to the P -odd and P, T -odd constants.

Our ﬁnal value for the hyperﬁne structure constant A diﬀers by less than 3% from the
experimental value [14]. That means that the symmetrical part of the spin density in the
vicinity of the Yb nucleus in our calculation is probably rather good. However, it is also very
important to reproduce the asymmetrical part of the spin density, which accounts for the
dipole constant Ad. Our value for Ad is in a slightly better agreement with the experiment
than the value from [4], but is still underestimated by almost 23%. About a half of this
diﬀerence can be explained by the fact that in our molecular calculation 4f -shell of the

excitations from the f -shell can be important.
In particular, they can explain the small
value of the spin-doubling constant γ [15]. It was shown recently that contribution of the
f -shell excitations to the spin density can give signiﬁcant correction to the constant Ad [3].
Using equations (19) and (31) from the paper [3] we obtain the following estimates for the
f -shell excitation contributions to A and Ad:

δA ≈ −3 MHz,

δAd ≈ 15 MHz.

Note that these corrections arise from the admixture to the molecular wave function of the
conﬁguration with the hole in the 4f shell. The weight of this conﬁguration was estimated
in [3] to be of the order of 4%. Such an admixture is a purely molecular eﬀect and is not
accounted for by the EO technique. So, we can conclude that δAd can be added to our value
for Ad, resulting in Ad ≈ 94 MHz, that is in a much better agreement with the experimental
value 102 MHz.

It is important that similar contribution of the 4f -shell excitations to the constant Wd
is strongly suppressed. Indeed, operator (2) mixes f - and d-waves. For Yb atom, 4d-shell
is very deep and its mixture with the 4f -orbitals by the molecular ﬁeld is very small, while
5d-shell is weekly bound and does not penetrate into the core region. Similar contribu-
tions to other constants Wi are negligible due to the contact character of the corresponding
interactions.

One can see that the values of the Wd constant from the unrestricted DF calculation [5],
the most recent semiempirical calculation [3] and the present GRECP/RASSCF/EO cal-
culation are in a very close agreement now. It is also important that the valence electron
contribution to the Wd in [5] is in 7.4% agreement with the corresponding RECP-based
calculation [2] (see table I). Another recent DF calculation [4] gives the value, which is two
times smaller.

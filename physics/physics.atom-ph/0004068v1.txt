Abstract

We discuss experiments and observations aimed at testing the possible space-time variability of
fundamental physical constants, predicted by the modern theory. Speciﬁcally, we consider two of
the dimensionless physical parameters which are important for atomic and molecular physics: the
ﬁne-structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio. We review the current status of such
experiments and critically analyze recent claims of a detection of the variability of the ﬁne-structure
constant on the cosmological time scale. We stress that such a detection remains to be checked by
future experiments and observations. The tightest of the ﬁrmly established upper limits read that
the considered constants could not vary by more than 0.015% on the scale ∼ 1010 years.

Introduction

Possible variability of fundamental physical constants is one of the topical problems of contemporary
physics. The modern theory (Supersymmetric Grand Uniﬁcation Theory – SUSY GUT, Superstring
models, etc.) has established that the coupling constant values which characterize diﬀerent kinds of
interactions (i) are “running” with the energy transfer and (ii) may be diﬀerent in diﬀerent regions of the
Universe and vary in the course of cosmological evolution (e.g., Ref. [1]). The energy dependence of the
coupling parameters has been reliably conﬁrmed by high-energy experiments (see, e.g., Ref. [2]), whereas
the space-time variability of their low-energy limits so far escapes detection.

Note that a numerical value of any dimensional physical parameter depends on arbitrary choice of
physical units. In turn, there is no way to determine the units in a remote space-time region other than
through the fundamental constants. Therefore it is meaningless to speak of a variation of a dimensional
physical constant without specifying which of the other physical parameters are deﬁned to be invariable.
Usually, while speaking of variability of a dimensional physical parameter, one implies that all the other
fundamental constants are ﬁxed. So did Milne [3] and Dirac [4] in their pioneering papers devoted
to a possible change of the gravitational constant G. More recently, a number of authors considered
cosmological theories with a time varying speed of light c (e.g., Ref. [5]). However, if we adopt the
standard deﬁnition of meter [6] as the length of path traveled by light in vacuum in 1/299 792 458 s,
then c = 2.997 924 58 × 1010 cm s−1 identically. Similarly, one cannot speak of variability of the electron
mass me or charge e while using the Hartree units ( = e = me = 1), most natural in atomic physics.
Thus, only dimensionless combinations of the physical parameters are truly fundamental, and only such
combinations will be considered hereafter.

At present, the most promising candidate for the theory which is able to unify gravity with all other
interactions is the Superstring theory, which treats gravity in a way consistent with quantum mechanics.
All versions of the theory predict existence of the dilaton – a scalar partner to the tensorial graviton. Since
the dilaton ﬁeld φ is generally not constant, the coupling constants and masses of elementary particles,
being dependent on φ, should vary in space and time. Thus, the existence of a weakly coupled massless

dilaton entails small, but non-zero, observable consequences such as Jordan–Brans–Dicke-type deviations
from General Relativity and cosmological variations of the gauge coupling constants [7]. These variations
depend on cosmological evolution of the dilaton ﬁeld and may be non-monotonous as well as diﬀerent in
diﬀerent space-time regions.

In this paper, we focus on the space-time variability of the low-energy limits of two fundamental

constants which are of paramount importance for atomic and molecular spectroscopy:
(i) the ﬁne-structure constant α = e2/c (Sommerfeld parameter),
(ii) the electron-to-proton mass ratio µ = me/mp (Born–Oppenheimer parameter).

The next section presents a compendium of the basic methods allowing one to obtain restrictions on
possible variations of fundamental constants. In Sects. 3 and 4, we consider recent estimates of the values
of α and µ, respectively, at cosmological redshifts z = 1–4 which correspond to epochs ∼ 7–13 billion
years ago. Conclusions are given in Sect. 5.

2 Tests of variability of fundamental constants

Techniques used to investigate time variation of the fundamental constants may be divided into extra-
galactic and local methods. The latter ones include astronomical methods related to the Galaxy and the
Solar system, geophysical methods, and laboratory measurements.

2.1 Local tests

2.1.1 Laboratory measurements

Laboratory tests are based on comparison of diﬀerent frequency standards, depending on diﬀerent com-
binations of the fundamental constants. Were these combinations changing diﬀerently, the frequency
standards would eventually discord with each other. An interest in this possibility has been repeatedly
excited since relative frequency drift was observed by several research groups using long term compar-
isons of diﬀerent frequency standards. For instance, a comparison of frequencies of He-Ne/CH4 lasers,
H masers, and Hg+ clocks with a Cs standard [8, 9, 10, 11] has revealed relative drifts. Since the con-
sidered frequency standards have a diﬀerent dependence on α via relativistic contributions of order α2,
the observed drift might be attributed to changing of the ﬁne-structure constant. However, the more
modern was the experiment, the smaller was the drift. Taking into account that the drift may be also
related to some aging processes in experimental equipment, Prestage et al. [11] concluded that the current
laboratory data provide only an upper limit | ˙α/α| ≤ 3.7 × 10−14 yr−1.

2.1.2 Analysis of the Oklo phenomenon

The most stringent limits to variation of the ﬁne-structure constant α and the coupling constant of the
strong interaction αs have been originally inferred by Shlyakhter [12] from results of an analysis of the
isotope ratio 149Sm/147Sm in the ore body of the Oklo site in Gabon, West Africa. This ratio turned out
to be considerably lower than the standard one, which is believed to have occurred due to operation of
the natural uranium ﬁssion reactor about 2 × 109 yr ago in those ores. One of the nuclear reactions in
the ﬁssion chain was the resonance capture of neutrons by 149Sm nuclei. Actually, the rate of the neutron
capture reaction is sensitive to the energy of the relevant nuclear resonance level Er, which depends
on the strong and electromagnetic interaction. Since the capture has been eﬃcient 2 × 109 yr ago, in
means that the position of the resonance has not shifted by more than it width (very narrow) during
the elapsed time. At variable α and invariable αs (which is just a model assumption), the shift of the
resonance level would be determined by changing the diﬀerence between the Coulomb energies of the
ground-state nucleus 149Sm and the nucleus 150Sm∗ excited to the level Er. Unfortunately, there is no
experimental data for the Coulomb energy of the excited 150Sm∗ in question. Using order-of-magnitude
estimates, Shlyakhter [12] concluded that | ˙α/α| . 10−17 yr−1. From an opposite model assumption that
αs is changing whereas α =constant, he derived a bound | ˙αs/αs| . 10−19 yr−1.

Comments on Atomic and Molecular Physics, 2000

Damour and Dyson [13] performed a more careful analysis, which resulted in the upper bound | ˙α/α| .
7 × 10−17 yr−1. They have assumed that the Coulomb energy diﬀerence between the nuclear states of
149Sm and 150Sm∗ in question is not less than that between the ground states of 149Sm and 150Sm. The
latter energy diﬀerence has been estimated from isotope shifts and equals ≈ 1 MeV. However, it looks
unnatural that a weakly bound neutron (≈ 0.1 eV), captured by a 149Sm nucleus to form the highly
excited state 150Sm∗, can so strongly aﬀect the Coulomb energy. Moreover, heavy excited nuclei often
have Coulomb energies smaller than those for their ground states (e.g., Ref. [14]). This indicates the
possibility of violation of the basic assumption involved in Ref. [13], and therefore this method may
possess a lower actual sensitivity. Furthermore, a correlation between α and αs (which is likely in the
frame of modern theory) might lead to considerable softening of the above-mentioned bound, as estimated
by Sisterna and Vucetich [15].

2.1.3 Some other local tests

Geophysical, geochemical, and paleontological data impose constraints on a possible changing of various
combinations of fundamental constants over the past history of the Solar system, however most of these
constraints are very indirect. A number of other methods are based on stellar and planetary models. The
radii of the planets and stars and the reaction rates in them are inﬂuenced by values of the fundamental
constants, which oﬀers a possibility to check variability of the constants by studying, for example, lunar
and Earth’s secular accelerations. This was done using satellite data, tidal records, and ancient eclipses.
Another possibility is oﬀered by analyzing the data on binary pulsars and the luminosity of faint stars.
Most of these have relatively low sensitivity. Their common weak point is the dependence on a model of
a fairly complex phenomenon, involving many physical eﬀects.

An analysis of natural long-lived α- and β-decayers in geological minerals and meteorites is much
more sensitive. For instance, a strong bound, | ˙α/α| < 5 × 10−15 yr−1, was obtained by Dyson [16] from
an isotopic analysis of natural α- and β-decay products in Earth’s ores and meteorites.

Having critically reviewed the wealth of the local tests, taking into account possible correlated syn-
chronous changes of diﬀerent physical constants, Sisterna and Vucetich [15] derived restrictions on
possible variation rates of individual physical constants for ages t less than a few billion years ago,
which correspond to cosmological redshifts z . 0.2.
In particular, they have arrived at the estimate
˙α/α = (−1.3 ± 6.5) × 10−16 yr−1.

All the local methods listed above give estimates for only a narrow space-time region around the Solar
system. For example, the epoch of the Oklo reactor (1.8 × 109 years ago) corresponds to the cosmological
redshift z ≈ 0.1. These tests cannot be extended to earlier evolutionary stages of the Universe, because
the possible variation of the fundamental constants is, in general, unknown and may be oscillating [17, 7].
Another investigation is needed for higher cosmological redshifts.

2.2 Extragalactic tests

Extragalactic tests, in contrast to the local ones, concern values of the fundamental constants in distant
areas of the early Universe. A test which relates to the earliest epoch is based on the standard model of
the primordial nucleosynthesis. The amount of 4He produced in the Big Bang is mainly determined by
the neutron-to-proton number ratio at the freezing-out of n↔p reactions. The freezing-out temperature
Tf is determined by the competition between the expansion rate of the Universe and the β-decay rate.
A comparison of the observed primordial helium mass fraction, Yp = 0.24 ± 0.01, with a theoretical
value allows one to obtain restrictions on the diﬀerence between the neutron and proton masses at the
epoch of the nucleosynthesis and, through it, to estimate relative variation of the curvature radius R
of extra dimensions in multidimensional Kaluza–Klein-like theories which in turn is related to the α
value [18, 19]. However, as noted above, diﬀerent coupling constants might change simultaneously. For
example, increasing the constant of the weak interactions GF would cause a weak freezing-out at a lower
temperature, hence a decrease in the primordial 4He abundance. This process would compete with the
one described above, therefore, it reduces sensitivity of the estimates. Finally, the restrictions would

be diﬀerent for diﬀerent cosmological models since the expansion rate of the Universe depends on the
cosmological constant Λ.

The most unambiguous estimation of the atomic and molecular constants at early epochs and in distant
regions of the Universe can be performed using the extragalactic spectroscopy. Accurate measurements
of the wavelengths in spectra of distant objects provide quantitative constraints on the variation rates of
the physical constants. This opportunity has been ﬁrst noted and used by Savedoﬀ [20], and in recent
years exploited by many researchers (see, e.g., Refs. [21, 22] and references therein). At present, the
extragalactic spectroscopy enables one to probe the physical conditions in the Universe up to cosmological
redshifts z . 4, which correspond, by order of magnitude, to the scales ∼ 1010 yr in time and ∼ 109
parsec in space. In the following sections, we review brieﬂy the studies of the space-time variability of
the ﬁne-structure constant α and the electron-to-proton mass ratio µ, based on the latter method.

3 Non-variability of α

We have already mentioned in Sect. 2.1.1 that several laboratory tests hinted at a tentative time variation
of α, but were later refuted by measurements at a higher level of accuracy. A similar situation has occurred
for extragalactic tests at larger space-time scales.

Bahcall and Schmidt [23] were the ﬁrst to use spectral observations of distant quasars to set a bound
on the variability of the ﬁne-structure constant. They have obtained an estimate ∆α/α = (−2 ± 5)× 10−2
at z = 1.95. Later statistical analyses [24, 25] of ﬁne-structure doublet lines in quasar spectra appeared to
indicate a tentative variation of α (of the order of ∼ 0.3% at the cosmological redshift z ∼ 2). However,
this tentative variation has been shown to result from a statistical bias [26].

Another statistical examination of the ﬁne-doublet wavelengths of absorption lines in quasar spectra
[21] indicated a tentative (at the 2–3σ level) variability of α values by ∼ 0.1% over the celestial sphere (as
function of angle) at redshifts z ∼ 2–3. However, this result has not been conﬁrmed by a later analysis
[22], which was based on higher-quality spectra and yielded an order of magnitude higher precision.

Quite recently, Webb et al. [27] have estimated α by comparing wavelengths of Fe ii and Mg ii ﬁne-
splitted spectral lines in extragalactic spectra and in the laboratory. Their result suggests a time-variation
of α at the incredibly high accuracy level of ∼ 10−3%: the authors’ estimate reads ∆α/α = (−1.9 ±
0.5) × 10−5 at z = 1.0–1.6. Note, however, two important sources of a possible systematic error which
could mimic the eﬀect: (a) Fe ii and Mg ii lines used are situated in diﬀerent orders of the echelle-spectra,
so relative shifts in calibration of the diﬀerent orders can aﬀect the result of comparison, and (b) if the
isotopic composition varies during the evolution of the Universe, then the average doublet separations
should vary due to the isotopic shifts. Were the relative abundances of Mg isotopes changing during the
cosmological evolution, the Mg ii lines would be subject to an additional z-dependent shift relative to the
Fe ii lines, quite suﬃcient to simulate the variation of α (this shift can be easily estimated from recent
laboratory measurements [28]).

The method based on the ﬁne splitting of a line of the same ion species is not aﬀected by these two
uncertainty sources. We have studied the ﬁne splitting of the doublet lines of Si iv, C iv, Mg ii and other
ions, observed in spectra of distant quasars. According to quantum electrodynamics, the relative splitting
of these lines δλ/λ is proportional to α2 (neglecting small relativistic corrections, recently estimated by
Dzuba et al. [29]). We have selected the results of high-resolution observations [30, 31, 32], most suitable
for an analysis of the variation of α. According to our analysis, presented elsewhere [33], the most reliable
estimate of the possible deviation of the ﬁne-structure constant at z = 2–4 from its present (z = 0) value:

∆α/α = (−4.6 ± 4.3 [stat] ± 1.4 [syst]) × 10−5.

Thus, only an upper bound can be derived at present for the long-term variability of α:

(at the 95% conﬁdence level).

| ˙α/α| < 1.4 × 10−14 yr−1

4 Non-variability of µ

The dimensionless Born–Oppenheimer constant µ = me/mp approximately equals the ratio of the con-
stant of electromagnetic interaction α = e2/c ≈ 1/137 to the constant of strong interaction αs =
g2/c ∼ 14, where g is the eﬀective coupling constant calculated from the amplitude of π-meson–nucleon
scattering at low energy.

An early limit on the possible variation of this constant, | ˙µ/µ| < 1.2 × 10−10 yr−1, has been derived
from the concordance of K–Ar and Rb–Sr geochemical ages [34]. The ﬁrst astrophysical bound [35], based
on the agreement between redshifts of atomic hydrogen and other lines in quasar absorption spectra,
turned out to be twice stronger.

Orders-of-magnitude more precise analysis has become possible due to discovery [36] of a system of
H2 absorption lines in the spectrum of quasar PKS 0528−250 at z = 2.811. A study of this system yields
information about physical conditions and, in particular, the value of µ at this redshift (corresponding
to the epoch when the Universe was several times younger than now). A possibility of distinguishing
between the cosmological redshift of spectral wavelengths and shifts due to a variation of µ arises from the
fact that the electronic, vibrational, and rotational energies of H2 each undergo a diﬀerent dependence
on the reduced mass of the molecule. Hence comparing ratios of wavelengths λi of various H2 electron-
vibration-rotational lines in a quasar spectrum at some redshift z and in laboratory (at z = 0), we can
trace variation of µ. We have calculated [21, 37] sensitivity coeﬃcients Ki of the wavelengths λi with
respect to possible variation of µ and applied a linear regression analysis to the measured redshifts of
individual lines zi as function of Ki. If the proton mass in the epoch of line formation were diﬀerent from
the present value, the measured zi and Ki values would correlate:

zi
zk

=

(λi/λk)z
(λi/λk)0

≃ 1 + (Ki − Kk)(cid:18) ∆µ

µ (cid:19) .

(3)

We have performed a z-to-K regression analysis using a modern high-resolution spectrum of PKS
0528−250. Eighty-two of the H2 lines have been identiﬁed. The resulting parameter estimate and 1σ
uncertainty is

The 2σ conﬁdence bound on ∆µ/µ reads

∆µ/µ = (−11.5 ± 7.6 [stat] ± 1.9 [syst]) × 10−5.

|∆µ/µ| < 2.0 × 10−4.

(4)

(5)

Assuming that the age of the Universe is ∼ 1.5 × 1010 yr the redshift of the H2 absorption system
z = 2.81080 corresponds to the elapsed time ≈ 1.3 × 1010 yr (in the standard cosmological model).
Therefore we arrive at the restriction

| ˙µ/µ| < 1.5 × 10−14 yr−1

(6)

on the variation rate of µ, averaged over 90% of the lifetime of the Universe.

5 Conclusions

Despite the theoretical prediction that fundamental constants of Nature should vary, no statistically
signiﬁcant variation of any of the constants has been reliably detected up to date, according to our
point of view substantiated above. The upper limits obtained indicate that the constants of electroweak
and strong interactions did not signiﬁcantly change over the last 90% of the history of the Universe.
The striking tightness of these limits is really astonishing and has already ruled out some theoretical
models (see Refs. [21, 22, 35]). A more elaborated theory (e.g., Ref. [7]) cannot be ruled out yet, but its
parameters can be severely restricted (e.g., see Ref. [22]). This shows that more precise measurements and
observations and their accurate statistical analyses are required in order to detect the expected variations
of the fundamental constants.

Abstract

In this paper we propose the idea of expanding the the space of variations in standard variational

calculations for the energy by considering the wave function ψ to be a functional of a set of functions

χ : ψ = ψ[χ], rather than a function. In this manner a greater ﬂexibility to the structure of the

wave function is achieved. A constrained search over all functions χ such that the wave function

functional ψ[χ] satisﬁes a constraint such as normalization or the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge sum

rule, or the requirement that it lead to a physical observable such as the density, diamagnetic

susceptibility, etc., is then performed. A rigorous upper bound to the energy is subsequently

obtained by variational minimization with respect to the parameters in the approximate wave

function functional. Hence, the terminology, the constrained-search variational method. The

construction of such a constrained-search wave function functional is demonstrated by example of

the ground state of the Helium atom.

One of the mostly extensively employed approximation methods in quantum mechanics

is the variational principle for the energy[1]. Consider a quantum mechanical system
with Hamiltonian operator ˆH. The ground eigenenergies E and eigenfunctions Ψ for
this system satisfy the Schr¨odinger equation ˆHΨ = EΨ. Next deﬁne the functional
ψ∗ψdτ . Searching over all bounded, quadratically integrable functions

R

ψ, one obtains I[Ψ] = E, with Ψ being the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation associated

with energy E. Since δI[ψ] = 0, the functional I[ψ] is stationary for ψ = Ψ. In practice, an

approximate function ψ of a particular analytical form, is chosen to depend upon a number

of variable parameters ci(i = 1, ..., p). A least upper bound to the ground state energy E0 is

obtained by solving the p equations ∂I[ψ]/∂ci = 0, and employing the derived set of values

of the parameters ci to calculate I[ψ] . In application of the variational principle, however,

the space of variations is limited by the choice of form of the function chosen for the

approximate wave function. For example, if a linear combination of Slater-type[2] orbitals

are employed as in the analytical Hartree-Fock theory wave functions of Clementi-Roetti[3],

then the variational space is limited to such exponential-type functions.

In this paper

we propose the idea of overcoming this limitation by expanding the space over which the

variations are performed. This then allows for a greater ﬂexibility for the structure of the

approximate wave function. We demonstrate the idea of expansion of the variational space

by example.

We expand the space of variations by considering the approximate wave function to

be a functional of the set of functions χ: ψ = ψ[χ], rather than a function. The space of

variations is expanded because the functional ψ[χ] can be adjusted through the function χ

to reproduce any well behaved function. However, this space of variations is still too large

for practical purposes, and so we consider a subset of this space. In addition to the function

ψ being of a particular analytical form and dependent on the variational parameters ci ,

the functions χ are chosen such that the functional ψ[χ] satisﬁes a constraint. Examples

of such constraints on the wave function functional ψ[χ] are those of normalization or the

satisfaction of the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge sum rule, or the requirement that it lead to

observables such as the electron density, the diamagnetic susceptibility, nuclear magnetic

constant or any other physical property of interest. A constrained-search over all functions

χ such that ψ[χ] satisﬁes a particular condition is then performed. With the functional ψ[χ]

2

thus determined, the functional I[ψ[χ]] is then minimized with respect to the parameters

ci . In this manner both a particular system property of interest as well as the energy are

obtained accurately, the latter being a consequence of the variational principle. We refer to

this way of determining an approximate wave function as the constrained-search variational

method.

As an example of the method we consider its application to the ground state of the Helium

atom. In atomic units e = ¯h = m = 1, the non-relativistic Hamiltonian is

and u.)

condition:

The constraint to be applied to the wave function functional ψ[χ] is the normalization

ψ∗[χ]ψ[χ]dτ = 1.

The next step is the constrained search over functions χ(q, s) for which this condition is

satisﬁed. We obtain two such functions χ1,2(q, s) by substitution of the ψ[χ] of Eq.(2) into

Eq.(5). This substitution leads to

Putting the term in square parentheses to zero is equivalent to a quadratic equation for the

function χ(q, s):

The integrals for the coeﬃcients a, b, and c are solvable analytically. Solution of the

quadratic equation then leads to the two functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) such that the two

wave functions ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] are normalized. The normalization is valid independent

of the value of the variational parameter q. Rigorous upper bounds to the ground state

energy are then obtained by variational minimization of the functional I[ψ[χ]] with respect

to the parameter q. The details of the derivation and analytical expressions are to be given

elsewhere.

The ground state energies obtained from the wave function functionals ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2]

are given in Table I together with those due to the pre-factor Φ(s) and the ‘exact’ value

of Pekeris[5]. The functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) for the energy minimized values of the

parameter q are plotted in Fig.1. We note the following points of interest: (i) The functions

χ1(q, s) , χ2(q, s) are very diﬀerent from each other. χ1(q, s) is a positive monotonically

decreasing function whereas χ2(q, s) is a negative monotonically increasing function. They,

however, are of about the same magnitude. (ii) In spite of the functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s)

being diﬀerent, the energies obtained from the corresponding wave functions are essentially

equivalent. Their diﬀerence is reﬂected in the values of the parameter q that minimize the

energy. (iii) It is also interesting that both solutions of the quadratic equation Eq.(7) lead

to meaningful energies.

A pictorial representation of the expanded space of variation relative to the standard

variational method is given in Fig.2. The large square box designated A corresponds to the

space of all square-integrable normalized wave functions. A convention is adopted whereby

4

FIG. 1: The functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) as a function of the variable s for the energy minimized

values of the variational parameter q.

functions of speciﬁcally deﬁned form such as Gaussian or Slater orbitals are represented by

the lines designated as such. Each point on these lines corresponds to a set of parameters.

A further convention is adopted by which an area represents a wider class of variations.

The space A thus also corresponds to the normalized wave function functionals ψ[χ(s, t, u)].

The subspace B represents the space of all the normalized functionals ψ[χ(s, t)], and its

subspace C that of all normalized functionals ψ[χ(s)]. The ﬁgure thus shows the greater

space of variations within the context of the present example.

Other points in the subspace C can be obtained by searching over diﬀerent analytical

forms of the function χ(s), and then obtaining the minimum of the functional I[ψ[χ]].

Another point in subspace C is obtained by reinterpreting the wave function of Caratzoulas
and Knowles [6] from our wave function functional perspective. In this case χ(s) = βe−µs,

where β and µ are additional variational parameters. The corresponding energy (see Table

FIG. 2: In the ﬁgure, the area of box A represents the space of all normalized square-integrable

functions. Speciﬁc functions such as Gaussian or Slater orbitals are represented by lines. The

B represents all normalized wave function functionals ψ[χ(s, t)], and its subspace C that of all

normalized wave function functionals ψ[χ(s)] .

I), minimized at q = 0.281163, β = 0.88066, µ = 0.99947, is essentially the same as that of

the one-parameter wave function functionals. (To our knowledge, the energy obtained by

ψ[χ2] is the most accurate one-parameter result for the energy thus far.)

As noted above, it is also possible to search over all function χ(q, s) such that the func-

tional ψ[χ] leads to a physical property of interest. For example, let us consider the ex-

pectation which gives the size of the atom: < r1 + r2 >=< s >= s0 + ∆s. Here s0 is the

expectation from the pre-factor Φ(s). Assuming ∆s known from experiment or some accu-

rate calculation, and if a wave function functional ψ[χ] of the form of Eq.(2) is employed,

then two distinct χ’s such that < ψ[χ]

ψ[χ] >= s0 + ∆s can be obtained by solution of

A] = 0,

(11)

where the constant A = 2∆s/α4, and where the coeﬃcients a, b and c are the same as in

Eq.(8-10). With the functionals ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] thus determined, the energy could then be

obtained by minimization with respect to the parameter q. In this manner, the two wave

function functionals would reproduce the size of the atom exactly and the energy accurately.

An improvement over the present results can be achieved as follows.

(i) Expand the

space of variations by considering χ to be a function of the variables s and t, or expand

the space still further by considering chi to be a function of the variables s, t, and u. (ii)

Replace the Hydrogenic pre-factor Φ(s) by the analytical Hartree-Fock wave function. (iii)

Combine the expansion of the variational space with the improvement of the pre-factor.

For completeness we note that the concept of constrained search in the present work

diﬀers from that of the constrained search[7] within density functional theory (DFT). The

key idea underlying DFT is based on the ﬁrst Hohenberg-Kohn theorem[8] according to

which the wave function Ψ is a functional of the ground state density ρ(r) : Ψ = Ψ[ρ]. Thus

the energy is a unique functional of the ground state density: E = E[ρ]. The in principle

constrained search to obtain the ground state energy within DFT is as follows. One ﬁrst

searches for the inﬁmum of the expectation of the Hamiltonian over all antisymmetric ,
normalized, N-particle functions Ψ whose density equals the ground state density ρ(r). One
then searches over all such ρ(r) to obtain the inﬁmum of that expectation. The consecutive

inﬁma can be shown to be a minimum and equal to the ground state energy. In our work,

the statement that the wave function is a functional of the functions χ is more general. The

7

functions χ are not restricted to just being functionals of the density. And the constrained

search over all functions χ is such that the wave function leads to an arbitrary property of

interest. The energy is subsequently obtained by variational minimization.

In addition to its use in Schrodinger theory, the wave function functional ψ[χ] may

also be employed within Quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT)[9]. In Q-DFT as in

traditional Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT[10], the system of electrons described by the Schrodinger

equation is transformed into one of noninteracting fermions such that the same ground state

density, energy and ionization potential are obtained. However, in contrast to KS-DFT in

which the description of the model system is in terms of energy functionals and functional

derivatives, the Q-DFT framework is in terms of ﬁelds and their quantal sources. The

sources are expectations of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the wave function.

Thus, an approximate wave function functional of the form of Eq.(2) can be employed in

this theory with the Slater determinantal pre-factor being determined self-consistently. The

wave function functional ψ[χ = f (ρ)] could also be used. Within Q-DFT, the corresponding

self-consistently obtained energy is a rigorous upper bound.

We also mention the work of Colle and Salvetti[11] who suggested a wave function func-

tional of the density. The form of this wave function is similar to Eq.(2) except that the

pre-factor is the Hartree-Fock theory wave function and the correlation term is

f (r1, r2) = e−β2r2

[1

χ(R)(1 + r/2)],

−

(12)

r2, R = r1 + r2, β = q[ρHF (R)]1/3. They further assumed that the corresponding
r = r1
single-particle density matrix was that due to the pre-factor. The function χ(R) was to

−

be determined by requiring that the correction to the Hartree-Fock single-particle density
matrix due to the correlation factor f (r1, r2) vanishes. This is not an exact constraint.
Moreover, they did not satisfy this condition, and instead approximated the function χ(R)
by χ(R) = √πβ/(1 + √πβ). A consequence of this was that the resulting wave function

was not normalized[12]. A critique of this wave function functional is given in references

[6, 12, 13].

In conclusion, we have proposed the idea of expanding the space of variations beyond

8

that of standard variational calculations by considering the wave function to be a functional

instead of a function, a functional of the functions χ. A constrained search is performed

over the functions χ such that the wave function satisﬁes a constraint or leads to a physical

observable. A rigorous upper bound to the energy is then obtained by variational mini-

mization with respect to any parameters in the wave function functional. The construction

of such a constrained-search wave function functional for the ground state of the Helium

atom is explicitly demonstrated. We believe this to be the ﬁrst in practice demonstration

of the concept of constrained search.

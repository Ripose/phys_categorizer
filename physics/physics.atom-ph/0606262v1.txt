We propose using a table-top ion interferometer to searh for deviations from Coulomb's inverse-

square law. Calulations show that suh a devie would be sensitive to deviations smaller than

6 × 10−22
over urrent experiments. It ould measure a non-zero photon rest mass smaller than 6 × 10−50
grams, more than 100 times smaller than urrent laboratory experiments. We also disuss the theory

in the exponent of the inverse-square law, an improvement by (cid:28)ve orders of magnitude

behind the proposed measurement and ompare our preditions to previous studies.

Matter-wave interferometry is a very useful tool to

test fundamental physial theories. One suh theory,

Coulomb's inverse square law, has been under srutiny

To (cid:28)nd C we apply the ondition that φ(r) must equal
the applied voltage when r = R (the radius of the tube).
We will write this voltage as V + Vg , where V is the volt-

age applied to the inner tube relative to the outer tube,

and Vg is the unknown voltage of the outer, grounded
tube. Then, beause µγ is known to be small, we an

approximate the potential inside the inner tube with a

however, are at two di(cid:27)erent radii and travel through

To estimate the smallest detetable mγ , we insert rea-

too small, stray eletri (cid:28)elds an have a signi(cid:28)ant ef-

fet on ion veloities and tra jetories. These (cid:28)elds will

be extremely small inside the tube at the loations of the

gratings (see Fig. 2), but they ould be muh larger in

the region where the ions are generated. We an write

the veloity as v = (2eVs/m)1/2
where m is the mass of
the ions and Vs is the voltage whih would just bring the
ions to a stop. Then we an set Vs to be several times

for reasonably long tubes (see Fig. 2). For a system with

Rather than absolute potential, the interferometer will

measure the potential di(cid:27)erene between the two arms.

tra jetory of the ions is not greatly perturbed by them.

Two other important parameters are the the maximum

exursion of the ions from the enter of the tube, a = r0 +
s, and the distane between gratings, L. A larger tube
radius aommodates a larger separation s and o(cid:27)set r0 .
A larger grating separation L means that the ions will

ABSTRACT

In this paper we present some concepts in heavy ion atomic physics for the ex-

traction of parity violating eﬀects. The main novel ingredient with respect to

earlier discussion is the so–called Stark–quenching, i.e., the fast decay of a meta

stable state induced by a Stark ﬁeld, which is an interesting eﬀect by itself. It

turns out that the discussed experimental schemes require beam energies of up

to 1 TeV/A, laser intensities of up to 1017W/cm2 and ion currents of up to 1011

beryllium-like ions per second. It is a major eﬀort to combine all of these ingre-

dients in one experiment. However, the fact that one can reach nearly realistic

scenarios encourages the search for improved experimental schemes based upon

the ideas presented here.

I. INTRODUCTION

The experiments done recently at CERN allow a very precise and excellent determination

of the constants of the standard model of weak interactions [1]. However, it is important

to test the theory also for small momentum transfers where possibly the situation could

be essentially diﬀerent from LEP experiments. Such small momentum transfer experiments

have been performed in several heavy atoms [2]. Recently the Atomic parity violating exper-

iment with Cesium has been improved in precision for a factor of seven, so that one obtains

a signal even for the anapol moment [3] which underscores the great potential which still

lies in the atomic physics to compete with the high energy experiments for measurements

of weak constants and phenomena.

In principle heavy ions oﬀer a better access to weak interaction processes than heavy atoms

because of the large overlap between the nucleus and the electrons in inner shells. Detailed

analyses for helium–like uranium [4] and uranium with up to ﬁve electrons [5] were under-

taken to ﬁnd a realistic experimental scheme to extract the PV signal. In this contribution

we continue our search by analyzing a number of possible signals based on the inclusion of

the Stark eﬀect as an ampliﬁcation factor for parity violation eﬀects in heavy ions.

The ﬁrst excited state of beryllium–like uranium 1s22s2p 3P0, in the case of zero nuclear
spin, is meta stable because it can decay only by a two–photon transition to the 1s22s2 1S0

ground state. In case of a non–vanishing nuclear spin the 1s22s2p 3P0 state gets an admix-

ture from a

state lying closely above due to hyperﬁne mixing which drastically reduces

3P1i

|

the lifetime of the meta stable 1s22s2p 3P0 state [6]. While this ’Hyperﬁne Quenching’ is

due to a magnetic ﬁeld our idea is to investigate a similar eﬀect due to an electric ﬁeld,

namely the ’Stark Quenching’: The strength of the Stark eﬀect which leads to a mixing of

the levels

1S0i

|

and

3P1i

|

can be varied by experimental conditions. This is interesting for

two reasons. On the one hand it can amplify the parity–violating mixing of the two levels

2

1s22s2p 3P0 and 1s22s2 1S0. (Such an ampliﬁcation was done in earlier experiments for mea-

suring parity–violation in heavy atoms [7,8].) On the other hand it allows for a control of

the lifetime of an atomic state by experimental conditions, which will certainly be useful for

other atomic physics experiments.

ing contributions [10,2] from top quarks, Higgs bosons or yet unknown particles beyond the

standard model.

Tab. I shows the various parity mixing coeﬃcients ηpv for some stable beryllium–like heavy

ions from Z = 26 to Z = 92 with zero nuclear spin. In this table there is given also the en-

ergies of the two levels 1s22s2p 3P0 and 1s22s2 1S0. The parity admixing eﬀect is decreasing

by four orders of magnitude from uranium to iron. How can one measure those admixture

coeﬃcients? There is in principle the possibility to use a laser to excite the 1s22s2p 3P0 state

starting from the ground state. One may use an ordinary optical laser and tune the energy

with the help of the relativistic Doppler shift by choosing a particular angle towards the ion

beam. As the laser light is coherent it can only excite the parity–violating 2E1 transition

(and to a lower extent also 2M1). Therefore the transition amplitude will be proportional

to η2

pv which is an extremely small number, but on the other hand, there should not be

any background process. For the energy gap of 260 eV to be covered for the beryllium like

uranium ion by an 1 eV laser by means of the Doppler shift, this would require ion energies

of 260 GeV/u. This could be well covered by the planed LHC accelerator which is supposed

to reach 2.76 TeV/u in Pb onto Pb collisions. For lighter ions this ﬁgure reduces accordingly.

The experimental setup is sketched in Fig. 1.

In order to estimate the expected transition rates, we must determine at least approxi-

mately the two–photon transition amplitude.

In principle one has to sum over all inter-

mediate states. This has been successfully performed for hydrogen–like systems, where the

wave functions are given analytically [9], but not for few–electron systems so far. Here we

. Furthermore we use the one–photon transition matrix elements, to estimate

the two–photon induced amplitude. To be more precise we use the following formulas for

the spontaneous and induced transition rates (in atomic units). For the laser intensity

distribution we take a simple box form with full width Γlaser and intensity I0. In case of

the two–photon transition the laser energy is chosen to be half of the transition energy:

With the transition probabilities we get also the reduced matrix elements which we can

in turn use to calculate the transition rates for induced absorption which is the same for

induced emission (without the contribution from spontaneous emission). Here the geometry

is given in Fig. 2: The Stark ﬁeld ~E points into the z–direction, while the ~k vector of the

In case of the 2E1 transition for simplicity we consider the two extreme polarization cases

ǫy = 0 and ǫz = 0. For the E1M1 transition we average over all polarizations of the two

photons which gives an additional factor 1/2. The energy width of laser has been assumed

to be Γlaser = 1 eV in the moving frame. We have chosen this value because high laser

intensities are incompatible with small line widths. From Tab. II it can be read oﬀ that

in the case if uranium for a counting rate of 1000 photons per second, a detector of three

meters length along the beam, and a luminosity of 1011 ions per second for inducing the

parity–conserving amplitude a laser intensity of at least 1014W/(cm)2 is necessary, which

may be practically attainable. For the parity–violating amplitude 1020W/(cm)2 is required,

which exceeds present technical possibilities. The E1M1 amplitude is slightly increasing

for lighter ions but because of the smaller admixture coeﬃcients ηPV the interesting 2E1

transition rate decreases about three orders of magnitude from uranium to iron.

6

III. STARK–QUENCHED AMPLITUDE

It may very well be that the transition amplitudes are too small to be measured. There-

fore it is interesting to search for possible ampliﬁcation factors. The idea is analogous to

the hyperﬁne quenching technique, but this time it would be done with a Stark ﬁeld. To

observe such a quenching eﬀect would be of great interest in its own. We calculate the

Stark–quenched amplitude simply by diagonalizing the matrix

with

Here ~E = (0, 0, Ez) is the electric Stark ﬁeld. The real part of the 2x2 matrix in Eq. (10)

of each eigenvalue is the energy of the corresponding level and the imaginary part is its

lifetime.

In Tab. III we give the resulting lifetime τStark together with the values of the

energy separation ∆E0 of the unperturbed states and the additional energy shift due to the

inﬂuence of the Stark ﬁeld ∆EStark. The crucial parameter is obviously the electric ﬁeld

strength which can be applied to induce the Stark mixing. Present techniques allows up to

E = 3

108 V/m. This would correspond for uranium to a lifetime of 1.104

105 seconds

×

∗

which is still by far too large. Through Lorentz contraction the applied electric ﬁeld for an 1

TeV/A – accelerator is increased by a factor 1000. This is partly oﬀ set by the time dilation

of the decay. Thus the net gain is γ instead of γ2. As a result the lifetime would be reduced

to 110.4 s.

IV. SEPARATING PARITY–VIOLATING AND PARITY–CONSERVING

TRANSITIONS BY STARK EFFECT

In the last section we have seen that, by means of the Stark eﬀect, we can induce a small

parity conserving M1–transition between the admixed

component of the ground state,

and the

state. In addition there is, though it is much weaker, also a second transition

which can be used, namely the PV admixed

component of the

state to the Stark

state within the ground state, see Fig 3. Suppose now that we place our

heavy ion in a Stark ﬁeld ~E pointing into the z – direction, and orient the laser beam along

the x–direction with polarization vector ǫ = (0, ǫy, ǫz), where ǫ2

y + ǫ2

z = 1, then the transition

rate from the 0+ ground state to the 0– ﬁrst excited state is given by

(12)

The remarkable point here is that the sort of transition being excited depends fully on the

polarization of the laser. If the laser light is polarized along the z–direction (ǫy = 0) only the

parity–violating transition occurs. However, the two amplitudes diﬀer by a factor η2

pv which

is of order 10−

16 and, furthermore, as both are Stark induced, this is anyway an extremely

weak transition. In Tab. IV we refer again to Eeﬀ = 1010 V/m and calculate the two induced

transition rates. For uranium an intensity of at least I = 1026W/cm2 would be needed for

a counting rate of 1000 photons per second and a detector of three meters along the beam

and a luminosity of 1011 ions per second of the parity–violating transition, which is of course

completely impossible. We do think however, that the basic mechanism is quite remarkable

and we will search for cases for which the Stark and parity violating admixture are larger.

For the lighter ions the situation is deteriorating for the Stark induced E1 transition while

it becomes slightly better in case of the M1 transition.

8

V. AMPLIFYING PARITY–VIOLATING EFFECTS VIA STARK INDUCED

EXCITATIONS

In this chapter we combine parity–violating eﬀects with Stark quenching. The idea is the

following: We consider a beryllium–like heavy ion with zero nuclear spin and a special laser

which emits two sorts of photons, one with full energy and one with half that energy. Such

lasers are already in use. The frequency splitting is due to special nonlinear crystals and

the phase coherence is preserved during the process. The laser light is emitted in a certain

angle to the direction of the ion beam in order to use the Doppler eﬀect in such a way that

the full energy is equal to the 1s22s2p 3P0 and the 1s22s2 1S0 transition energy. In order to

keep a ﬁxed phase between the Stark amplitude and the parity–violating amplitude, it is

necessary to have a standing wave of both sorts of photons with full and with half energy.

The diﬃcult point is however that one needs a certain phase shift between the two waves

which comes from the fact that the interference part is proportional to cos φ with φ being

the phase diﬀerence of the two amplitudes. The phase shift needed can only be estimated

when the full two–photon transition is calculated. As we use only a rough approximation

we must leave this phase shift as a free parameter.

Furthermore the laser light must be linearly polarized. And the spin of the two photons

with half energy and the one with full energy must be the same. The linear polarization

has the big advantage that it has components with negative as well as with positive circular

polarization and in this way there exist always two photons which couple to spin zero for

the 2E1 transition.

Now the ion is placed in a Stark ﬁeld to induce the admixture of the 1s22s2p 3P1 state

to the 1s22s2p 3S0 state. The laser will coherently induce two transition amplitudes. One

is the M1 amplitude of the photons with full energy which is Stark induced and the other

is the parity–violating amplitude which is the 2E1 amplitude, from the two photons of half

The coordinate system is shown in Fig 2: The direction of the ˆk vector of the photon is

given by the x axis. The Stark ﬁeld points along the z–axis. The polarization vector ~ǫ

is then lying in the z – y plane. The situation is most favorable if it points in the y–

direction. We then may take simply the values from Tab. II. We now use the maximum

laser intensity available, i.e., I = 1017W/cm2 with phase diﬀerence properly adjusted so that

we can set φ = 0. Furthermore we use a realistic Stark ﬁeld of E = 109 V/m with a Doppler

ampliﬁcation of 103 taken already into consideration. The width of the laser is taken to be

Γlaser = 1 eV. We then see a realistic possibility to measure the parity–violating amplitude

for a counting rate of 8000 photons per second and a detector of three meters along the

beam and a luminosity of 1011 ions per second by reversing the sign of the linear dependent

ions per second, one would need a run of 2

3.5 hours for a signal with a relative error of 10

×

% and subsequently about 29 days for an error of 1%. On the other hand, lets say it would

be possible to construct a laser with a line width of Γ = 0.01eV in the moving frame the

counting rate would be ten times higher, thus reducing the time for the experiment to 2.9

days. This shows how crucial all numbers given here depend on the experimental conditions

and on the atomic structure. In both cases we can only present some plausible estimates

here. On the other hand these ideas are worthwile being mentioned because they give some

hints of how with technical progress such an experiment might be feasible.

10

Note that the asymmetry will increase with every gain in laser power, because the in-

terference term increases as I 1.5

0 , while the E1 amplitude increases only linearly with I0.

Furthermore reducing the Stark ﬁeld by one order of magnitude will amplify the asymmetry

also by an order of magnitude, but at the same time the transition amplitude is reduced by

two orders of magnitude too, so one has to carefully optimize the parameter choice. The

asymmetry values for other ions under the same conditions are displayed in Tab. V. The

asymmetry is decreasing for the lighter ions down to iron and this means that these ions

oﬀer no favorable alternative to uranium experiments.

In summary we have examined the possibility to perform parity violating experiments with

beryllium-like uranium. With the eﬀects discussed here such an experiment could become

feasible only at LHC energies. But we stress again, that the eﬀect of Stark quenching should

be experimentally accessible in other more favorable conditions, where it will allow to study

interesting phenomena. Lighter ions than uranium are no alternative because the weak ef-

fects decrease without being compensated by an ampliﬁcation by the Stark quenching eﬀect.

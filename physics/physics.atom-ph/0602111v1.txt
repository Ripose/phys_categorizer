We propose to use matrix-isolated paramagnetic diatomic molecules to search for the electric
dipole moment of electron (eEDM). As was suggested by Shapiro in 1968, the eEDM leads to the
magnetization of a sample in the external electric ﬁeld. The eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the unpaired
electron in the heavy polar diatomic molecules is of the order of 1010V/cm. That leads to a huge
enhancement of the eﬀect in comparison to other condensed matter experiments, where eﬀective
ﬁeld is of the same order of magnitude as the laboratory ﬁeld, typically about 105V/cm. Statistical
sensitivity of the proposed experiment allows to improve the current upper limit on eEDM by 3
orders of magnitude in few hours accumulation time.

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a basic, yet experimentally
unproven, concept of particle physics. Finding evidence
for SUSY is a goal of the Large Hadron Collider. Alterna-
tively, SUSY can be revealed in atomic-physics quest for
electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM). Already
the present limit on eEDM [1] is comparable to predic-
tions of the “naive” SUSY models [2, 3]. Other SUSY
extensions yield eEDM a few orders of magnitude be-
low the present limit. Here we propose an eEDM search
that may constrain eEDM at that important level. Our
proposal relies on the fact that the thermodynamically
averaged eEDM (and thus the electron’s magnetic mo-
ment aligned with eEDM) is oriented along the electric
ﬁeld. We propose to employ polarized molecular radi-
cals frozen in a rare-gas matrix and measure the eEDM-
induced magnetic ﬁeld generated by the sample. Conser-
vative estimates project that the present limit on eEDM
can be improved by several orders of magnitude.

The searches for the elusive eEDM are motivated by
the fact that the existence of a permanent EDM of a par-
ticle violates both parity (P) and time-reversal (T) sym-
metries. Due to the compelling arguments of the CPT
theorem, the T-violation implies CP-violation, a subject
of great interest in the physics of fundamental interac-

interactions are conventionally studied with high-energy

is derived from a high-precision measurement [1] with a
beam of Tl atoms. In such experiments one spectroscop-
ically searches for a tiny eEDM-induced splitting of the
magnetic sublevels of an atom in an externally applied
electric ﬁeld.

Presently, there are two major trends aimed at improv-
ing the experimental sensitivity to eEDM: (i) employing
molecules instead of atoms in spectroscopic experiments

[5, 6, 7] and (ii) non-spectroscopic solid state experiments
[8, 9, 10]. Here we propose to merge these two trends:
we suggest searching for eEDM with molecules trapped
in a cold matrix of rare-gas atoms (see Fig. 1). We argue
that this scheme combines advantages of both techniques.
Indeed, the eEDM eﬀects in molecules are markedly am-
pliﬁed because of the strong internal molecular electric
ﬁeld [11], much larger than attainable laboratory ﬁelds.
In the present solid-state schemes the atomic enhance-
ment of the external electric ﬁeld for ions of a solid is of
the order of unity [9]. By using matrix-isolated diatomic
radicals instead of the ions in a solid, one can gain up to
six orders of magnitude in the eﬀective electric ﬁeld. At
the same time one retains a great statistical sensitivity of
the solid-state searches. Here we show that this particu-
lar combination seems to drastically improve sensitivity
of the eEDM search.

Let us

the non-
review important aspects of
spectroscopic solid-state search for the eEDM. Intro-
duced by Shapiro [12], this scheme exploits the link be-
tween EDM of the electron and it’s spin, d = deσ,
µBσ =
and therefore it’s magnetic moment, µe ≈ −
µBd/de.
In an external E-ﬁeld, because of the cou-
−
pling of the eEDM to the E-ﬁeld, thermal populations of
the spin-up and spin-down states slightly diﬀer, leading
to the magnetization of the sample. By measuring the
generated magnetic ﬁeld one derives constraints on the
eEDM. A proof-of-concept experiment has been carried
out in 1978 by Vasiliev and Kolycheva [13]. At that time
the solid-state experiment appeared to be less sensitive to
the eEDM than the spectroscopic beam experiments. It
is only very recently that the advances in magnetometery
(see [14] and references therein) have revived an interest
to the solid-state eEDM searches [8, 9, 15, 16]. Alterna-
tively, one can look for a voltage induced in a sample in
external magnetic ﬁeld [10].

We focus on molecular radicals (i.e., molecules with

problem, one applies an external E-ﬁeld. This ﬁeld cou-
ples to the traditional molecular electric-dipole moment

electrodynamics. Its very presence is a manifestation of
the parity and time-reversal violation.

By measuring BCP one constrains eEDM via Eqs. (3)
and (2).
It is apparent that maximizing n is beneﬁ-
cial. However, bringing radicals together is problem-
atic — they react chemically. Here is where the ma-
trix isolation technique [25] becomes key. In this well-
established method, the molecules are co-deposited with
rare-gas atoms or other species onto a cold (T
1 K)
substrate. The molecular guests become trapped in the
matrix. Small trapped molecules exhibit properties sim-
ilar to those for free molecules and a variety of studies,
including determination of hyperﬁne-structure constants
has been carried out. Still there is an upper limit on
the density of trapped molecules; to avoid spin align-
ment in the subsystem of guest molecules one requires
that thermal agitations are stronger than dipole-dipole
interactions between the molecules. This leads to

cording to the Kramers’ theorem, in the absence of mag-
netic ﬁelds, all levels of diatomics with half-integer spin
remain two-fold degenerate for any possible electric ﬁeld
generated by the matrix environment.

EDM interaction operates at short distances near the
heavier nucleus. Expanding the electronic wavefunction
in partial waves we notice that contribution to the eEDM
signal of total angular momenta beyond s1/2– and p1/2–
waves are strongly suppressed because of the growing
centrifugal barrier and properties of the eEDM [26]. The
truncated wave function has the C∞,v symmetry and Ω
still remains a good quantum number for the degener-
ate states of matrix-isolated radicals. Within this ap-
proximation, the eﬀective molecular Hamiltonian in the

It is instructive to compare this value to the permanent
molecular CP-violating magnetic moment introduced by
us in Ref. [16]. This moment arises due to a magnetiza-
tion of the molecule by it’s own electric ﬁeld (irrespec-
tive of the temperature). The largest µCP for diamag-

Free diatomic molecules can be easily polarized by the

data on polarizing matrix-isolated molecules [28]. Cer-
tainly, the rotational dynamics of the guest molecule is
strongly aﬀected by the matrix cage. The molecular axis
evolves in a complex multi-valley potential, subject to
the symmetry imposed on the molecules by the matrix
cage. Depending on the barrier height between diﬀerent
spatially oriented valleys, the guest molecule may either
execute hindered rotation or librations about the valley
minima. Ref. [29] reports evidence for hindered rotation
of HXeBr and Ref. [30] suggests that some hydrides can
rotate. That gives us a conﬁdence that the HgH radical
can be polarized by the external electric ﬁeld.

Finally, we proceed to evaluating the sensitivity of the

consider: weakest measurable B-ﬁeld and signal-to-noise
ratio. Presently, the most sensitive measurement of mag-
netic ﬁelds has been carried out by the Princeton group
(see [14] and references therein). This group has reached
10−12 G/√Hz. A projected

projected B-ﬁeld sensitivity. These values are reduced
by a factor of 50 for a moderate 10 kV/cm polarizing
ﬁeld. The estimates will be also suppressed by factor γ

In addition to limitations imposed by the weakest mea-

for a volume of 10−3 cm3 and strong polarizing ﬁeld, the
present eEDM limit may be recovered within t = 10−5 s
(30 ms for the ﬁeld 10 kV/cm). By integrating the signal
for one week, the present eEDM limit may be improved
105. Note that these estimates fall
by a factor of 2
between the estimates based on the achieved [14] and
projected [8] sensitivity to the weak magnetic ﬁelds.

To summarize, our proposed eEDM search combines
advantages of the strong intermolecular ﬁeld with a high
attainable number density of molecules embedded in a
matrix of rare-gas atoms. We argue that our proposal
has a potential of improving the present eEDM limit by
several orders of magnitude. It is anticipated that such
an improvement may ﬁnally reveal supersymmetry and
in any case constrain the “new physics” beyond the Stan-
dard Model at an important new level.

Harmonium in intense laser ﬁelds: excitation,
absorption, and transparency

Abstract.
It is known that the dynamics of two (Coulomb-interacting) nonrelativis-
tic electrons conﬁned by a parabolic potential and driven by a classical, intense laser
ﬁeld (in dipole approximation) is exactly soluble. We calculate the time-dependent
population of the harmonic oscillator states and the energy absorbed from the laser. It
turns out that the key entity on which all observables sensitively depend is the mod-
ulus square of the Fourier-transformed vector potential of the laser ﬁeld, evaluated at
the harmonic oscillator frequency. The system is transparent to laser ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tions for which this entity vanishes. We discuss the Poisson statistics behavior of the
transition probabilities and analyze the conditions for the maximal energy absorption
eﬃciency.

1. Introduction

is a model of great practical

importance, as it approximates
The parabolic well
any arbitrary potential close to equilibrium.
In nanotechnology, potentials of simple
shape such as quantum dots are often well approximated by parabolic potentials.
Superpositions of harmonic oscillators are also used to describe continua, environments,
and ﬁeld modes.

Correlations, for instance, those introduced by the Coulomb interaction between
electrons, attract growing attention. Correlated electron dynamics can nowadays be
analyzed experimentally with great precision using “reaction microscopes”[1]. Two
electrons conﬁned in a parabolic potential, sometimes called “harmonium” or the
“Hooke’s atom” version of helium [2], is of great interest since the problem represents
one of the few exactly soluble problems involving correlation [3, 4]. As such harmonium
serves as a testing ground for, e.g. new exchange-correlation potentials in density
functional theory.

In the ﬁeld of strong laser atom interaction, exactly soluble models are rare as
well, in particular as it comes to electron correlation. Fortunately, the two-electron
wavefunction of the laser-driven harmonium can still be expressed in analytical form as
long as the laser ﬁeld is treated classically and in dipole approximation [5].

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2 we derive the exact solution of the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation of two interacting electrons conﬁned in a parabolic
potential and driven by a classical (laser) ﬁeld (in dipole approximation). In Sec. 3 the

probabilities for two-electron excitations from an arbitrary state m to a state n are
calculated. The latter are the basis for the discussion of optimal energy absorption and
transparency in Sec. 4. Finally, we conclude in Sec. 5.

is proportional to the excursion of a driven, classical harmonic oscillator, and (ii) that
the time-dependent solution U0(Z, t) represents a so-called coherent wave packet, i.e. a
state of minimum uncertainty ∆p ∆Z = ¯h/2, equally distributed over the momentum
p and the spatial coordinate Z (see, e.g. [9]).

3. Photoexcitation of the electron pair

Let us consider the photoexcitation of an electron pair conﬁned in a parabolic well
(e.g. two electrons occupying the low-lying states of a quantum dot). The transition
amplitude is given by the overlap of the exact time-dependent two-electron wave function
Ψ(r1, r2, t) with the asymptotic stationary solution Φ(r1, r2) when the ﬁeld is switched

Here we made use of the fact that neither the sub-problem of relative motion of the two

where we introduce the important parameter σ(t), which depends on the laser ﬁeld and
the oscillator frequency [cf. Eqs. (9) and (10)].

The formula for the photoexcitation probability (15) describes the distribution of
the electronic wave packet among the oscillator states as a function of time and the EM
ﬁeld parameter. It has the form of a Poisson distribution, which is characteristic for
stochastic processes where the system absorbs the ﬁrst amount of energy from the ﬁeld
independently from the possibility of the absorption of the second portion and so on.

In Fig. 1 we illustrate the above expression for P (0→n) for a laser pulse of frequency
t2/2) (dashed curve). The survival
ν = 2 with a Gaussian envelope, A(t) = sin νt exp(
probability P 0→0(t), changing from unity to some ﬁnal value, has one maximum during
the pulse due to the oscillation of the CM wave packet inside the potential and the
associated maximum overlap with the ground state as the center of the wave packet
passes through Z = 0. The transition probabilities of the excited states behave in the
opposite way, i.e. they are minimum at these times.

Of particular interest are the asymptotic excitation probabilities limt→+∞ P (m→n)(t)
since they are experimentally accessible observables. In Fig. 2 the distribution P (m→n)
is portrayed as a 2D intensity plot vs the (analytically continued) excitation quantum
number n and the ﬁeld-strength parameter σ. The latter is proportional to the laser
intensity (see the discussion in the next section). Plots (a) and (b) correspond to the
diﬀerent initial states with m = 0 (ground state) and m = 3 accordingly. For m = 0 the

The essential fact is that the ﬁeld strength parameter contains the cumulative mass
ǫ2
and the charge of the CM subsystem with diﬀerent powers σ
µ . Therefore, the
observables in the single and in the double-electron excitation diﬀer from each other. In
particular, the energy absorption from the same laser pulse by (2e)-system is twice as
large as in the one electron case.

∼

In the generalized many-particle problem the parabolic potential contains an
arbitrary number of electrons N. As in the (2e)-case the N-electron CM subhamiltonian
accounting for the EM ﬁeld can be separated from the ﬁeld-independent relative motion
of the electrons. Then, all the formulae describing two-electron transitions are valid for
the many-electron case up to the eﬀective charge and mass. Hence the energy absorption
changes linearly with the number of electrons in the well, E(N e)
abs = N. Given this
property, the number of active electrons in a harmonic system may be experimentally
accessible.

abs /E(1e)

Let us now discuss the two extreme cases of energy absorption, that is, maximum
and vanishing absorption of energy from the laser ﬁeld. Vanishing absorption (i.e.
transmission) means that the survival probability of the electron pair at the detection
time approaches unity, P (m→m)(t
1. The latter is strictly realized at the
→
zero value of the ﬁeld-strength parameter σo = 0 in the exponent in (17). Hence,
according (23), the absence of the oscillator frequency in the spectrum of the vector
potential, A(ω) = 0, precludes absorption. Note, that this statement is correct for any
ﬁeld intensity and not just in a ﬁrst order perturbative treatment as for nonparabolic
conﬁnements.

As an example, consider a pulse consisting of two consecutive Gaussians, shifted
in time by the interval 2a: A(t) = sin(t + a)e−(t+a)2 + sin(t

at ﬁnding a relation between the time delay and the oscillator frequency, for which
. The result is ωa = π(k + 1/2)
0 = A(ω; a) =
with k an integer. This is, in fact, a condition for the destructive interference (in time)
of the two waves within the characteristic time-domain 2π/ω of the system. In terms
of the excitation picture the explanation is the following: the electronic wave packet,
distributed over the excited levels by the ﬁrst pulse, may be assembled back to the initial
state by the second pulse, if the phase diﬀerence between the pulses is chosen properly.
Maximum absorption occurs when the survival probability tends to zero, e−σo
0.
This is the case if the spectral power at the transition frequency E is inﬁnitely

5. Conclusion

In this paper we considered the exactly solvable problem of the excitation of two
interacting electrons, conﬁned in a parabolic well in the presence of a laser ﬁeld. The
expression for the time-dependent population of the excited two-electron states was
derived. The physical features of the process, such as the Poisson statistics of the
transition probabilities and the linear dependence of the energy absorption on the laser
power, were analyzed. In particular, the conditions for maximal absorption eﬃciency
and for transparency were obtained. Our approach can be used for the testing of
approximate theories dealing with few-body multiphoton excitations.

One of us (O.K.) would like to thank A. Voitkiv and N. Fominykh for stimulating
discussion. This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

Figure 2. The asymptotic distribution P (m→n)(t
) of the two-electron wave
packet over the excited states, i.e. their population vs. the (analytically continued)
quantum number and the ﬁeld intensity is illustrated as a 2D intensity plot. Figures
(a) and (b) correspond to the diﬀerent initial states with m = 0 (ground state) and
m = 3, respectively. The red line in (a) [determined by the eq. (20)] denotes the
position (the quantum number) of the maximally populated state for the given ﬁeld-
intensity parameter σ.

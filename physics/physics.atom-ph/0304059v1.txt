INTRODUCTION

At present the lowest-lying states in heavy Li-like ions can be investigated very precisely

both theoretically and experimentally. One of the most precise experimental results in these

systems has been obtained by Beiersdorfer and co-workers [1] for the 2p3/2-2s transition

energy in Li-like bismuth, which was determined with an accuracy of 0.04 eV. Accurate

experimental data are available at present for a number of other elements as well. For

the latest high-precision measurements we refer to Refs.

[2, 3, 4]; the outline of earlier

investigations can be found in Ref. [2].

The accuracy reached in experimental investigations provides a promising tool for probing

QED corrections in the strong Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus up to second order in the ﬁne

structure constant α. For the 2p1/2-2s transition, this project has been carried out in a

series of our previous investigation [5, 6, 7, 8]. In Ref. [8] we completed the evaluation of all

two-electron QED corrections of second order in α and obtained most accurate theoretical

predictions for the 2p1/2-2s splitting within a wide range of nuclear charge numbers Z.

Based on a careful estimate of the uncertainty of the theoretical values, we concluded that

already now the comparison of theory and experiment for Li-like uranium provides a test

of QED eﬀects of second order in α at the level of accuracy of about 17%. For the 2p3/2-

2s and 2p1/2-2s transitions in Li-like bismuth, analogous calculations have been performed

recently by Sapirstein and Cheng [9]. However, in order to match with the experimental

accuracy for the 2p3/2-2s splitting, rigorous evaluations of second-order QED corrections are

required also for other ions than bismuth. The ﬁrst step in this direction has been performed

in our earlier investigation [5] where we have evaluated the vacuum-polarization screening

correction for several energy levels of Li-like ions, including the (1s)22p3/2 state. The aim

of the present work is to calculate the two-photon exchange correction for this state (for

extensive calculations of these corrections for the lower states in Li-like ions and for non-

mixed low-lying states in He-like ions we refer the reader to Refs. [7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]).

After all that, the self-energy screening correction remains the last uncalculated two-electron

second-order QED contribution for this state.

This paper is organized as follows.

In the next section we present the basic formulas

for the two-photon exchange correction for the (1s)22p3/2 state. The description of our

numerical procedure is given in Sec. III, and the results obtained are discussed in Sec. IV.

II. BASIC FORMULAS

The detailed derivation of the two-photon exchange corrections to the (1s)22s and

(1s)22p1/2 states of Li-like ions can be found in our previous paper [8]. For the (1s)22p3/2

state the derivation is performed along the same lines. Thus, we present mainly the ﬁnal

formulas here. Our derivation is based on the two-time Green function (TTGF) method

[15, 16]. For the detailed description of the method we refer to the recent review [17].

The two-photon exchange corrections to the (1s)22p3/2 state of the Li-like ions can be con-

veniently separated in three parts: the two-photon exchange contribution due to the interac-

tion between two 1s electrons, the two-photon exchange contribution due to the interaction

between the valence electron and one of the 1s electrons, and the three-electron contribu-

tion. The ﬁrst part coincides with the two-photon exchange correction to the ground-state

energy of He-like ions. Its calculation was carried out in [10, 11]. This correction does not

contribute to the 2p-2s splitting in Li-like ions and is not considered here. The remaining

two-electron and three-electron corrections are diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 1.

We start from the expression for the second-order correction to the energy shift of the

The superscripts in Eq. (1) indicate the order of the contribution in α.

For the two-photon exchange correction, Feynman diagrams contributing to ∆g(2)(E)

are presented in Fig. 1. We refer to the corresponding contributions as the ladder (a),

the crossed (b), and the three-electron (c) terms. The second term in Eq. (1) is known as

the disconnected contribution. It vanishes completely when considered together with the

3

reducible contribution (for details, see [8]). In our case, the unperturbed wave function is

permutation operator (in the factor (

1)P , the parity of the permutation is implied by P ).

For brevity we will use also the following notations:

We separate the contributions of the diagrams under consideration into two parts: the

reducible, with the energy of the intermediate state coinciding with the energy of the initial

(ﬁnal) state, and the irreducible, for the remainder, respectively. Omitting the derivation

similar to that in Ref.

[8], we present here only the ﬁnal expressions for the energy shift.

Here we introduced the labels ”lad” and ”cr” for the ladder and the crossed diagram, and

”dir” and ”exch” for the direct and the exchange parts. The other notations are:

u = (1

i0), and the prime on the sum indicates that some terms are excluded from the

−

summation. First of all, we omit the reducible contribution, i.e. the terms for which the

intermediate two-electron energy εn1 + εn2 equals the energy of the initial two-electron state

εv + εc. Those are: (εn1εn2) = (εcεv) and (εvεc). In addition, we exclude also the infrared-

divergent terms (see [8, 18] for details), namely those with (εn1εn2) = (εcεv) in the direct

crossed part and with (εn1εn2) = (εcεc) and (εvεv) in the exchange crossed part. These terms

should be considered together with the reducible contribution. Their sum can be shown to

be infrared ﬁnite. We employ the notations ∆E2el

”ir” and ∆E2el

”red” in order to emphasize that

the corresponding terms are not ”pure” irreducible and reducible contributions.

5

We mention that the case under consideration diﬀers from the cases of the 2s or 2p1/2

valence electrons considered previously in [8] by the fact that for the 2p3/2 Dirac state there

is no adjoining state separated only by the ﬁnite-nuclear-size eﬀect. Consequently, there is

no need to exclude any further terms from the crossed contribution, as we had to proceed

in Ref. [8] in the case of the 2s and the 2p1/2 valence electron.

Finally, we note the ”reducible” contribution

III. NUMERICAL EVALUATION

The three-electron contribution to the energy of (1s)22s, (1s)22p1/2, and (1s)22p3/2 levels

of Li-like ions has been calculated in our recent investigation [19]. This evaluation appears as

relatively simple since the corresponding expressions (7), (8) contain at most one summation

over the Dirac spectrum and no integrations over the virtual-photon energy. Thus we focus

here on the calculation of the two-electron contribution.

The summation over magnetic substates in Eqs. (10)-(13), (18) was performed by means

of standard techniques. The resulting expressions can be found in [8]. As an independent

check we employed also the direct numerical summation of Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients.

To calculate inﬁnite summations over the spectrum of the Dirac equation in Eqs. (10)-

(13), we employed the method of the B-spline basis set for the Dirac equation [20]. Typical

basis sets contained 50 positive and 50 negative-energy eigenstates for each value of the

angular-momentum quantum number κ. The ﬁnite size of the nucleus has been taken into

account employing the homogeneously-charged sphere model for the nuclear-charge distribu-

tion. The values of the rms radii used in this work are the same as in [8]. Inﬁnite summations

over κ were truncated typically at

= 10. Partial sums of the expansion over

were

(19)

using the least squares method. The coeﬃcient a0 yields the extrapolated value for the sum

of the expansion. We found that diﬀerent ﬁts with N = 4-6 yield the same result with an

accuracy of at least 5 digits.

The integration over the energy of the virtual photon ω in Eqs. (10)-(13) represents the

most diﬃcult part of the calculation. To avoid strong oscillations for large values of ω, we

performed the Wick rotation of the integration contour. Deforming the contour, one should

take care about the poles and the branch cuts of the integrand. The analytic structure of

the integrand for Eqs. (11)-(13) is shown in Figs. 2-5. These graphs are very similar to

those for the 2s- and 2p1/2-valence electrons in Ref.

[8]. The only diﬀerence is that now

three Dirac energy levels occur which are more deeply bound than the valence state: 1s, 2s,

and 2p1/2. The terms in Eqs. (11) and (13) containing these states and the valence state as

intermediate were treated in a diﬀerent way than the remainder, as is discussed below.

For the evaluation of the direct parts of the ladder and crossed contributions, we perform

the Wick rotation of the integration contours separating the corresponding pole contribu-

tions, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. In the direct part of the reducible contribution, we also

perform a Wick rotation and then integrate by parts. This yields the following expression

which can be evaluated directly,

where F ′(∆) = (dF/dω)ω=∆.

Let us now turn to the exchange contribution. As one can see from Figs. 4 or 5, in this

case the integration contour is squeezed between two branch cuts of the photon propagators

on the interval [0, ∆vc]. Therefore, the standard Wick rotation of the contour is not possible.

It is convenient to divide the contributions of Eqs. (11) and (13) into two parts. The ﬁrst

one accounts for the poles of the integrand on the interval [0, ∆vc] and is referred to as the

irregular part. The remainder is denoted as the regular part. This contribution does not

possess any poles close to the squeezed part of the contour, which simpliﬁes its numerical

evaluation. However, it turns out as is the most time-consuming part of the calculation.

identities:

The evaluation of the irregular part is less time consuming, but its structure is more

diﬃcult. In this case we need to take care of single and double poles of the integrand that

are located close to the integration contour. The potential occurrences of one or two single

poles and one double pole within the interval [0, ∆vc] were treated by means of the following

in the brackets is considered. For the each single term, the integral is infrared divergent.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results of our calculations are presented in Table I, where the direct, the exchange,

and the three-electron contribution to the two-photon exchange correction of the valence

2p3/2 electron with the (1s)2 shell are listed separately. The evaluation was performed

within the Feynman gauge. We estimate the numerical uncertainty of our results to be

less than 5

10−5 a.u. For bismuth, our results can be compared with the calculation by

×

Sapirstein and Cheng [9]. They report

6.529 and

6.670 eV for the two-electron and the

−

−

three-electron contribution, respectively. This agrees well with our corresponding results of

6.5330 and

6.6698 eV, respectively.

It is interesting to compare the results of the rigorous QED treatment with approx-

imations evaluations based on relativistic many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The

diﬀerence between the QED and MBPT results can be conventionally regarded as a ”non-

trivial” QED contribution. In order to deduce the two-photon exchange correction within

the framework of MBPT, we should introduce the following changes in our basic formulas:

all summations over intermediate states should be restricted to positive-energy states only,

the calculation should be performed within Coulomb gauge, and the virtual-photon energy in

the photon propagator should be set equal to zero. Within this approximation, all reducible

parts vanish, and the integration over the energy of the virtual photon can be carried out

employing Cauchy’s theorem. This yields zero for the crossed contribution, and ﬁnally we

are left with the following expression for the total two-photon exchange correction within

the MBPT approximation:

where the photon propagators should be taken in the Coulomb gauge and the prime indicates

that terms with vanishing denominator should be omitted. We mention that Eqs.

(25)

and (26) include the contribution due to the exchange by two Breit photons (the B

B

term). Strictly speaking, this term is of higher order than the level of validity of the Breit

approximation, and, therefore, it appears to be inconsistent to include it within the MBPT

scheme.

In Table II and in Fig. 6 we compare the results of the rigorous QED treatment of the

9

(25)

(26)

×

two-photon exchange correction to the 2p3/2-2s splitting with the complete MBPT result

[Eqs. (25) and (26)], and the MBPT result dropping the B

B term. A similar analysis for

×

the 2p1/2-2s splitting has been presented in our previous investigation [8]. Our results show

that in the case under consideration the nontrivial QED contribution is essentially larger

than that for the 2p1/2-2s transition. E.g., for uranium it yields

0.011 a.u., while the

corresponding contribution to the 2p1/2-2s splitting is two times smaller, of about

0.006

−

−

a.u. Moreover, we see that in our case the total correction changes its sign in the region

between Z = 92 and 100. As a result, the MBPT result becomes incorrect by more than

50% at very high values of Z. A further conclusion that can be drawn from our comparison

is that for the 2p3/2-2s splitting the B

B term is of the same sign and magnitude as

×

the nontrivial QED contribution. Thus, its inclusion improves the agreement between the

MBPT and the QED result. This situation is contrary to the one for the 2p1/2-2s splitting,

where the B

B term turns out to be of the same order of magnitude, but of diﬀerent sign

×

than the nontrivial QED contribution.

To summarize this investigation we presented a rigorous QED evaluation of the two-

photon exchange correction for the (1s)22p3/2 state of Li-like ions. Combining these results
with the data for the (1s)22s state from our previous study [8], we obtained the two-photon

exchange correction for the 2p3/2-2s splitting. This is an important step towards the ﬁnal

goal consisting in the evaluation of all two-electron second-order QED corrections to the

2p3/2-2s transition energy for the Li isoelectronic sequence.

We present studies of strong coupling in single-photon photoassociation of cesium dimers using an optical
dipole trap. A thermodynamic model of the trap depletion dynamics is employed to extract absolute rate coefﬁ-
cents. From the dependence of the rate coefﬁcient on the photoassociation laser intensity, we observe saturation
of the photoassociation scattering probability at the unitarity limit in quantitative agreement with the theoretical
model by Bohn and Julienne [1]. Also the corresponding power broadening of the resonance width is measured.
We could not observe an intensity dependent light shift in contrast to ﬁndings for lithium and rubidium, which
is attributed to the absence of a p or d-wave shape resonance in cesium.

Ultracold thermal and quantum degenerate atomic ensem-
bles have allowed to investigate powerful coupling schemes
between continuum scattering states of two atoms and bound
molecular states of the corresponding dimer. Both photoas-
sociation light [2, 3] or magnetic ﬁeld sweeps across Fesh-
bach resonances [4, 5, 6] have lead to the formation of ul-
tracold molecules. Three-body recombination of fermionic
atoms near a Feshbach resonance has ﬁnally lead to the cre-
ation of molecular Bose Einstein condensates [7, 8, 9]. Re-
cently, molecular photoassociation has been performed using
a two-photon Raman process in a two-atom Mott insulator
phase [10], which may prove to be a route to a molecular Mott
insulator and, subsequently, an alternative way to a molecu-
lar BEC [11].
In contrast to this, the successful formation
of ultacold molecular ensembles in the absolute rovibrational
ground state, which is important if one wants to study molecu-
lar collisions and reactions over long interaction times, is still
at large. Future routes for the production of absolute ground
state molecules from a pair of atoms will certainly involve Ra-
man type coupling schemes [12, 13, 14]. A very interesting
approach to transfer highly vibrationally excited molecules
into the vibrational ground state proposes the application of
optimally controlled femtosecond laser pulses [15].

In order to understand the regime of strong coupling in
photoassociation, which is important for both continuous and
femtosecond Raman processes, we report in this Rapid Com-
munication investigations of saturation effects in the ﬁrst pho-
toassociation step from the two-atom continuum to an excited
molecular level. This is also the determining step in the over-
all molecule formation rate [16]. Using an ultracold ensemble
of cesium atoms trapped in a quasi-electrostatic optical trap
[17] we are able to employ trap loss measurements to extract
absolute photoassociation rate coefﬁcients [18], from which
the dependence of the rate coefﬁcient on the photoassociation
laser intensity is derived.

Previously, Schl¨oder et al. have investigated strong cou-
pling in a 6Li7Li two-species magneto-optical trap and ob-
served broadening and center shifts of several photoassocia-
tion resonances [19]. Comparing their results to the semiclas-
sical model of Bohn and Julienne for strong-ﬁeld photoasso-
ciation [1] a saturation intensity of 30-50 W/cm2 was derived
[19]. McKenzie et al. [20] and Prodan et al. [21] have studied
photoassociation out of a Bose-Einstein condensate of Na and
7Li, respectively, to determine the limit for the photoassoci-
ation rate coefﬁcient. While McKenzie et al. have observed
a linear relationship between laser intensity and association
rate up to about 1 kW/cm2, Prodan et al. clearly ﬁnd that
the photoassociation rate saturates at the unitarity limit of the
inelastic scattering cross section, due to probability conserva-
tion in the quantum mechanical scattering process [21]. These
results are conveniently interpreted in the framework of the
two-body scattering model of Ref. [1], as long as the low in-
tensity regime is concerned. Effects of high photoassociation
laser intensities have been investigated in several other papers,
emphasizing the multichannel character of the photoassocia-
tion process which have to be described within a molecular
dressed-state approach. Speciﬁc discussions on cold sodium
and rubidium photoassociation are proposed in Ref. [22], on
strontium photoassociation in Ref. [23], and on photoassocia-
tion in a Na Bose-Einstein condensate in Ref. [24].

The photoassociation experiments are performed with a
thermal ensemble of cesium atoms trapped in an optical dipole
trap formed by the focus of a CO2 laser [18]. As described in
Refs. [25, 26], the cesium atoms are loaded from a magneto-
optical trap which is superimposed in the focus of the CO2
laser. The MOT is operated in ﬁve-beam conﬁguration and
loads from a Zeeman slowed beam up to 108 particles at a
density of 109 cm−3 as inferred from absorption imaging.

After turning of the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT a brief mo-
lasses cooling phase transfers about 5 × 105 atoms at a density
of 5 × 1011 cm−3 and a temperature of 40 µK into the opti-
cal dipole trap [25, 26]. For the cold cesium atoms the CO2
laser focus with its potential depth of 0.8 mK represents a har-
monic trap with axial and radial trap frequencies of 12.8 Hz
and 625 Hz respectively. The lifetime of the atoms in the
dipole trap is of the order of 100 s, due to collisions with resid-
ual gas atoms.

The photoassociation light is provided by a widely tunable
Titanium:Sapphire laser (Coherent MBR 110) system with a
typical output power of 200 mW, and a line width of about
100 kHz. Relative frequency changes are monitored by mea-
suring the transmission signal of the Ti:Sapphire laser through
a confocal cavity with a free spectral range of 500 MHz. In
order to decrease the frequency spacing of the transmission
peaks, two side-bands are modulated onto the Ti:Sapphire
beam at ±166 MHz using a double-pass AOM setup. The
length of the cavity is stabilized by locking one of the cav-
ity mirrors with a piezo actuator to the fringe of the transmis-
sion signal of a superimposed spectroscopy stabilized diode
laser. This provides a relative frequency accuracy of about
5 MHz. The absolute laser frequency is measured with a com-
mercial wavemeter (Burleigh WA 1000) with an accuracy of
500 MHz. The photoassociation laser is passed through the
trapped cesium cloud in the focus of the CO2 laser at an angle
of 22.5◦ with respect to the CO2 laser beam. The width of the
Ti:Sapphire beam at the trap center amounts to about 150 µm.
The intensity of the photoassociaton beam has been changed
between 30 to 400 W/cm2.

Once the cesium atoms are loaded into the dipole trap, the
shutter of the photoassociation laser is opened and the atom
cloud is illuminated for 1 s. Then the CO2 laser light is extin-
guished and all remaining cesium atoms are recaptured into
the magneto-optical trap. The number of recaptured cesium
atoms is obtained from the ﬂuoresence signal of the MOT with
an accuracy of 30 %. Since the storage time of atoms inside
the dipole trap can range up to 100 s the atom loss signal is
a direct measure for the formation of cold molecules through
photoassociation.

To investigate how and at which intensities the photoasso-
ciation scattering rate saturates we have measured the depen-
dence of the association rate into the v = 6, J = 2 rovi-
brational states of the 0−
g outer potential well (see Fig. 1) on
the photoassociation laser intensity. The atom loss spectrum
of this photoassociation resonance is shown for four different
laser intensities in the upper panels of Fig. 2. It can be seen
that the width increases with intensity, whereas the increase
in the number of lost atoms due to photoassociation slows
down for large intensities. The peak position on the other
hand remains unchanged. In order to extract absolute pho-
toassociation rate coefﬁcients from the atom loss spectra we
have developed an analyic thermodynamic model of the trap
depletion dynamics that takes into account the decrease in pair
density and increase in cesium temperature over the course of
the photoassociation process [18]. Using this model the atom
loss spectra are converted into rate coefﬁcients as shown in
the lower panels of Fig. 2. The overall accuracy of the rate co-
efﬁcient values is estimated to be 40 % due to the accuracy in
particle number and temperature determination [18]. The rate
coefﬁcients are found to exhibit a stonger increase with laser
intensity as the atom loss spectra, which is a consequence of
the saturation due to trap dynamics that is unfolded in the rate
coefﬁcient spectra. Nevertheless, both a saturation effect and
a broadening of the rate coefﬁcient spectra in the lower panel
of Fig. 2 are observed. These are attributed to intrinsic satura-
tion of the single-photon photoassociation process.

By ﬁtting a single Lorentzian to the v = 6, J = 2 reso-
nances, as shown in Fig. 2, we obtain the maximum photoas-
sociation rate coefﬁcient, the resonance width and the rela-
tive resonance position as a function of the photoassociation
laser intensity (see Fig. 3). The peak width is corrected for
the 3.5 MHz inhomogeneous AC stark shift that the atoms ex-
perience in the dipole trap. The thermal broadening of the
resonances at the temperature of the cesium atoms of 40 µK
corresponds to less than 1 MHz and is also corrected for.

From the ﬁtted rate coefﬁcient G the quantum mechanical

scattering probability pscatt is given by

When plotting the scattering probability as a function of the
intensity for intensities up to 500 W/cm2 (see Fig. 3a) satura-
tion is clearly observable. Within the experimental accuracy
the measured scattering probability always stays below unity,
in agreement with the unitarity limit. The resonance width
increases linearly with intensity (see Fig. 3b), whereas the po-
sition of the resonance remains unchanged (see Fig. 3c).

These results are compared to the theoretical model of Bohn
and Julienne for photoassociation in strong laser ﬁelds [1],
giving the scattering probability:

Veg is the Rabi frequency of the electronic transition, which is
proportional to the square-root of the laser intensity. The sat-
uration intensity IS is introduced according to I/IS = Γ/γ.
In this formalism the resonance width is given by

δfFWHM = γ + Γ = γ(1 +

).

The saturation intensity is obtained from the measured data
for the scattering probability and the resonance width by a ﬁt
with Eqs. 3 and 5 (see Fig. 3). The two ﬁts agree very well
with each other and yield a saturation intensity of 460±90 and
450±150 W/cm2, respectively. The ﬁt to the scattering prob-
ability used the maximum scattering probability as a second
free parameter because the overall accuracy of the scattering
probabilities of about 40 %, due to the accuracy of the ex-
tracted rate coefﬁcients, is larger than the accuracy of the ﬁt.
The ﬁt value of 1.36±0.07 for the maximum scattering proba-
bility is in good agreement with unity within this experimental
accuracy.

By extrapolation to zero intensity the natural line width γ
of the photoassociation transition can be extracted. From the
ﬁt, a value of 17 ± 2 MHz is derived. This value is larger
than the predicted theoretical resonance width of 10.4 MHz
that amounts to twice the atomic line width of the 6s − 6p
transition. Thus, the measured width may be the consequence
of additional broadening mechanisms. One mechanism that
could be responsible for the discrepancy between the predic-
tion and the experiment is the lifting of the degeneracy of the
magnetic sub-levels of the J = 2 state in the electric ﬁeld
of the CO2 laser [27]. We have estimated the energy differ-
ence between the different mJ levels to be about 7 MHz, as-
suming that the molecular polarizability along the internuclear
axis is twice the atomic polarizability. This interpretation of
aligned molecules in the ﬁeld of the CO2 laser trap will be
investigated further in future experiments. Another possible
explanation could be found in Ref. [28], where photoassocia-
tion is described within the molecular dressed state approach
at low intensities. Due to the very low kinetic energy in the
entrance channel, the continuum wavefunction and the pho-
toassociation wavefunction are predicted to be coupled at low
photoassociation intensities (typically 10 W/cm2) to the last
bound state lying very close to the Cs(6s)+Cs(6s) limit, in-
ferred by its large scattering length. This contribution is not
included into the model of Ref. [1]. The consequent multi-
channel character of the photoassociation process described
now as a two-level plus continuum coupled system, would in-
duce a non-linear variation of the linewidth, which could well
converge to the expected doubled atomic value. This hypoth-
esis, which is also discussed in Ref. [23], is not easy to check
in experiments due to the weakness of the photoassociation
signal at very low intensities.

Ref. [1] also predicts a linear shift of the absolute resonance
position, previously observed in a 7Li quantum degenerate gas
[21], and in a Na Bose-Einstein condensate [20]. In the latter
case, the shift is attributed to the presence of a shape reso-
nance in the d-wave collisional entrance channel according to
the prediction of Ref. [22]. Simoni et al. [22] also predict a
light shift enhanced by a d-wave shape resonance. In both the
Na and Rb case, the calculated light shift ignoring the shape
resonance is found negligible. The clear absence of a shift in

3

our measurements for intensities up to the saturation intensity
seems to support the absence of any p- or d-wave shape res-
onance in cesium. The calculations performed in Ref. [28]
also predicts a negligible light shift in the presently explored
intensity range. It should be noted that the absence of a light
shift in the present experiment also leads to a correspondingly
negligible inhomogeneous broadening of the photoassociation
resonance, in contrast to previous saturation studies where it
had to be accounted for [19, 20].

Photoassociation experiments inside a quasi-electrostatic
optical dipole trap allow for precise measurements of absolute
photoassociation rate coefﬁcients, due to the high pair density,
the long interaction times, and the well deﬁned internal hy-
perﬁne state of the trapped atoms. This allows us in this work
to investigate quantitatively the saturation of the photoasso-
ciation rate coefﬁcient with increasing photoassociation laser
intensity. It is found that the scattering probability saturates
at unity, corresponding to the the unitarity limit of this inelas-
tic scattering process. The same result was concluded in the
experiment with quantum degenerate 7Li [21]. Saturation at
the unitarity limit has to be distinguished from saturation in
an optical transition, thus Rabi oscillations between the pair
of atoms and the molecular dimer, for which we see no indi-
cation, are not expected under these conditions. We also ob-
serve that the photoassociation resonance width exhibits a lin-
ear increase with intensity. Both the saturation and the width
increase are in good quantitative agreement with the theoret-
ical model of Bohn and Julienne using the saturation inten-
sity as the only parameter of the model, for which a value
of 450±100 W/cm2 is obtained. A light shift is found to be
strongly suppressed, which is attributed to the lack of a p or
d-wave shape resonance in cesium, in contrast to the ﬁndings
for sodium or rubidium.

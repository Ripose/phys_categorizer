Abstract

In atom interferometers based on two photon transitions, the delay induced

by the diﬀerence of the laser beams paths makes the interferometer sensitive to

the ﬂuctuations of the frequency of the lasers. We ﬁrst study, in the general

case, how the laser frequency noise aﬀects the performance of the interferometer

measurement. Our calculations are compared with the measurements performed

on our cold atom gravimeter based on stimulated Raman transitions. We ﬁnally

extend this study to the case of cold atom gradiometers.

Introduction

Atom interferometry allows to realize measurements in the ﬁelds of frequency

metrology [1], inertial sensors [2, 3], tests of fundamental physics [4, 5, 6]. This

technique is based on the splitting of an atomic wave function into separated

wave packets. The diﬀerence in the quantum phases accumulated by the wave

packets can be extracted from the interference pattern obtained when recom-

bining them. Among the various types of coherent beam splitters developed

for matter wave manipulation [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], two photon transitions have

proven to be powerful tools for precise measurements. For instance, atom in-

terferometers based on Bragg transitions [8] can be used for polarisability [12]

and fundamental measurements [13]. Stimulated Raman transitions [14] al-

lowed the development of high precision inertial sensors [15, 16, 17, 18], whose

performances compete with state of the art instruments [19, 20].

In the case of interferometers based on two photon transitions, atomic

wave packets are split and recombined with light pulses of a pair of counter-

propagating laser beams, which couple long lived atomic states. The sensitivity

of such interferometers arises from the large momentum transfer of counter-

propagating photons. A propagation delay is unavoidable between the two

counter-propagating beams at the position of the atoms, and we show here that

this delay makes the interferometer measurement sensitive to the lasers fre-

quency noise. Without losing generality, we detail this eﬀect in the case of our

gravimeter, based on stimulated Raman transitions. However, the formalism

presented here can be applied to any type of interferometer where two photon

transitions are used as beam splitters.

The sensitivity to inertial forces of such an interferometer arises from the

imprinting of the phase diﬀerence between the lasers onto the atomic wave

1

function [21]. As temporal ﬂuctuations in this laser phase diﬀerence aﬀect the

measurement of the atomic phase, a high degree of phase coherence is required.

This coherence can be obtained either by using two sidebands of a single phase

modulated laser [2], or by locking the phase diﬀerence between two independent

lasers [22, 23]. In both cases, the phase relation is well determined only at a

speciﬁc position, where the laser is modulated or where the frequency diﬀerence

is measured. Between this very position and the atoms, this phase diﬀerence

will be aﬀected by ﬂuctuations of the respective paths of the two beams over

the propagation distance. In most of the high sensitivity atom interferometers,

the inﬂuence of path length variations is minimized by overlapping the two

beams, and making them propagate as long as possible over the same path.

The vibrations of any optical element shift the phase of each laser, but do

not strongly disturb their phase diﬀerence as long as the lasers co-propagate,

because their optical frequencies are very close. However, for the interferometer
to be sensitive to inertial forces, the two beams (with wave vectors ~k1 and ~k2)
have to be counter-propagating. The two overlapped beams are thus directed

to the atoms and retro-reﬂected. Among the four beams actually sent onto

the atoms, two will realize the interferometer pulses. As a consequence, the

reﬂected beam is delayed with respect to the other one. The phase diﬀerence at

the atoms position is then aﬀected by the phase noise of the lasers, accumulated

during this reﬂection delay.

In this article, we investigate both theoretically and experimentally the in-

ﬂuence of the delay on the sensitivity of an atom interferometer. In the following

section, we brieﬂy describe our experimental setup. The transfer function of

the interferometer phase noise with respect to the Raman laser frequency noise

is derived in section 3, and compared with experimental measurements. In sec-

tion 4, we demonstrate the sensitivity limitations induced by the retro-reﬂection

delay of the lasers in the case of our atomic gravimeter. We then discuss how

such limitations could be overcome. The discussion is ﬁnally extended to the

case of high precision gradiometers, whose performances might be limited by

their intrinsic propagation delays.

2 Experimental setup

Our interferometer is a cold atom gravimeter based on stimulated Raman tran-

sitions, which address the two hyperﬁne sublevels F = 1 and F = 2 of the
5S1/2 ground state of the 87Rb atom. We use successively a 2D-MOT, a 3D-
MOT and an optical molasses to prepare about 107 atoms at a temperature
of 2.5 µK, within a loading time of 50 ms. The intensity of the lasers is then

adiabatically decreased to drop the atoms, and we detune both the repumper

and cooling lasers from the atomic transitions by about 1 GHz to obtain the

two oﬀ-resonant Raman lasers. A description of the compact and agile laser

system that we developed can be found in [24]. The preparation sequence ends

A sequence of three pulses (π/2

combines the atomic wave packets. At the output of the interferometer, the

transition probability from an hyperﬁne state to the other is given by the usual
formula of two waves interferometers : P = 1
2 (1 + C cos ∆Φ), where C is the
contrast of the fringes, and ∆Φ the diﬀerence of the atomic phases accumulated

along the two paths. We measure by ﬂuorescence the populations of each of the

two states and deduce the transition probability. The diﬀerence in the phases

two consecutive pulses [2].

The Raman light sources are two extended cavity diode lasers, ampliﬁed

by two independent tapered ampliﬁers. Their frequency diﬀerence is phase

locked onto a microwave reference source generated by multiplications of highly

stable quartz oscillators. The two Raman laser beams are overlapped with a

polarization beam splitter cube, resulting in two orthogonally polarized beams.

First, a small part of the overlapped beams is sent onto a fast photodetector to

measure an optical beat. This beat-note is ﬁrst mixed down with a reference

microwave oscillator, and ﬁnally compared to a stable reference RF frequency in

a Digital Phase Frequency Detector. The phase error signal is then used to lock

the laser phase diﬀerence at the very position where the beat is recorded. The

phase locked loop reacts onto the supply current of one of the two lasers (the

”slave” laser), as well as on the piezo-electric transducer that controls the length

of its extended cavity. The impact of the phase noise of the reference microwave

oscillator on the interferometer sensitivity, as well as the performances of the

PLL has already been studied in [26]. Finally, the two overlapped beams are

injected in a polarization maintaining ﬁber, and guided towards the vacuum

chamber. We obtain the counter-propagating beams by laying a mirror and

a quarterwave plate at the bottom of the experiment. As displayed in ﬁgure
1, four beams (L1, L2, L′
2) are actually sent onto the atoms. Because of
the selection rules and the Doppler shift induced by the free fall of the atoms,
only the counter-propagating pair L1/L′
following, we deﬁne L1 as the ”master” laser, and L2 as the ”slave” one.

the phases of the downward-propagating master laser and of the retro-reﬂected

If no assumption is made on the distance L between the mirror and the atoms,

the retro-reﬂection delay td is not the same for the three pulses. However, in
our experiment, the maximum duration of an interferometer is 100 ms, which

corresponds to a 5 cm atomic path, much smaller than the distance L

50 cm.

We can thus consider td constant during the measurement, and write the inter-
ferometer phase shift as:

as already described in [26]. A remarkable feature of the function H(ω) is a

low pass ﬁrst order ﬁltering, arising from the fact that the response time of the

atoms to a perturbation is necessarily limited by the Rabi frequency. The cutoﬀ
frequency is given by fc = √3ΩR/6π = √3/12τR.

In our experimental setup, the delay time is about td = 3 ns. Since the

3.2 Measurement of the transfer function

In order to measure the amplitude of Z(f ), we modulate the master laser fre-

quency at a frequency f . The applied frequency modulation is detected in the

beat-note between the master laser and a ’reference’ laser, locked on a atomic
line of the 87Rb by a saturated spectroscopy setup. The frequency of the beat-
note is converted into a voltage modulation by a frequency to voltage converter

(FVC). When the modulation is not synchronous with the cycle rate, the re-

sponse of the interferometer appears as a periodic modulation of its phase. Its

amplitude is the modulus of the transfer function, and the apparent period of

the response depends on the ratio f /fs, where fs is the sampling rate of the
experiment. For these measurements, the cycle rate was fs = 4 Hz.

We choose the modulation frequency as f = (n + 1/10)fs and record the
transition probability from which we extract the transfer function amplitude

. We run the experiment with a modest interrogation time of 2T =
Z(f, td)
|
|
2 ms, which allows us to reach a good signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 250 per

shot for the detection of the perturbation. As the interferometer phase shift

scales as the square of T , best sensitivities to inertial forces are usually obtained

for large values of T . However, in that case, the interferometer also becomes

more sensitive to vibrations, which limit the SNR to about 50 in our experiment

when 2T = 100 ms.

Figure 2 displays the measured and calculated transfer function Z as a

function of the modulation frequency f , for three values of the retro-reﬂection

length: 2L = 93, 118 and 150 cm. The weighting function zeros occur when the

period of the perturbation is a multiple of T + 2τR. In that case, the phase of
the perturbation is the same for each of the three pulses, and the corresponding

interferometer phase shift ∆Φ = ϕ1

2ϕ2 +ϕ3 vanishes. One can see on ﬁgure 2

that the experimental points agree with the calculation (eq. 7), demonstrating

−

that the amplitude of Z increases linearly with the time delay td.

We also test further the relation between our measurement of the transfer

function and the weighting function H(ω) [26]. We measure the transfer func-

tion for a ﬁxed value of td, for frequencies respectively lower and higher than
the low pass cut-oﬀ frequency fc. In our case, a π/2 pulse is 6 µs long, so fc is
fc, there is
about 24 kHz. The measurements are presented in ﬁgure 3. For f

a slight shift between the measurement and the theoretical expression of Z. We

tested out various possible origins like the duration and timings of the pulses,

the synchronization of the frequency synthesizer we used to modulate the laser

frequency and the clock frequency of the experiment, but this shift is still not

understood. However it does not aﬀect the value of the variance integrated over

the whole spectrum (see eq. 10).

4 Limits on the interferometer sensitivity

4.1 Theoretical analysis

We ﬁnally quantify the degradation of the interferometer sensitivity as a func-

tion of the laser frequency noise level and of the optical delay. Using the equa-

required to reach a given sensitivity, for given retro-reﬂection delay and Raman

pulse duration.

4.2 Example of the laser frequency noise inﬂuence

In a second experiment, the frequency noise is deliberately degraded by adding

noise on the master laser current. We use a high gain ampliﬁer with an incor-

porated tunable low pass ﬁlter (Stanford Research System SR650) as the noise

source, with its input connected to ground. We basically control the amount

of RMS frequency noise by changing the cut-oﬀ frequency of the ﬁlter (see ﬁg.

4). The PSD of the master laser frequency noise is measured by analyzing the

FVC output with a FFT analyzer (we made sure it is well above the PSD of

the reference laser to which the master laser is compared). We also measure the

power spectrum of the laser without additional noise, and we calculate the two

corresponding variances, with or without added noise, using equation (10). The

diﬀerence between the two variances gives the expected variance degradation

6

∆σ2
Φ of the interferometer phase noise. We compare this calculation with the
experimental value of ∆σ2
Φ obtained by measuring the diﬀerence between the
variances of the interferometer phase with and without added noise. The ex-

periment was performed for 2L = 93 cm, and the ﬁgure 5 shows the comparison

between the calculated and the measured values of the variance degradation.

The experimental values agree very well with the result of the calculation.

From the nominal frequency noise spectrum (curve (a) on ﬁgure 4), we

estimate that the retro-reﬂection induces a laser frequency noise contribution

of 2.4 mrad/shot to the total interferometer noise.

5 Discussion

5.1 Sensitivity limitation of the gravimeter measurement

This contribution of the frequency noise does not depend on the duration 2T of

our interferometer. Indeed, as discussed before, the retro-reﬂection delay td can
be considered as constant even for the longest interferometer we can perform.

Moreover, dominant contributions to the variance arise from the high frequency

part of the laser frequency noise spectrum, for which the fast oscillations of the

transfer function average to the same value, regardless to 2T .

The calculated laser frequency noise contribution induced by the retro-

reﬂection is of the same order of magnitude than the other sources of phase noise

also due to the lasers. Indeed, the PLL noise contributes for 2.1 mrad/shot [26],

the various frequency references for 1.6 mrad/shot [24], and the propagation in

the optical ﬁber for 1.0 mrad/shot. All these noise sources are independent,

so the frequency noise of the Raman lasers represents a total contribution of

σΦ = 3.7 mrad/shot to the interferometer phase sensitivity.

The phase sensitivity of 2.4 mrad/shot limits the sensitivity of the accelera-
10−9g/√Hz with our experimental parameters
tion measurement up to σg = 3
(2T = 100 ms, τR = 6 µs, L = 93 cm, and cycle rate 4 Hz). However, the in-
terferometer sensitivity is presently limited to 2.10−8g/√Hz by the vibration
noise.

×

We want to emphasize here that our ECDL have excellent white frequency

noise ﬂoor, which corresponds to a linewidth of only 5 kHz. Excess 1/f noise at

low frequency is inherent to the diode lasers. It could be reduced more eﬃciently

by using other locking techniques which allow larger bandwidths [28, 29, 30].

Other laser sources based on frequency doubled ﬁber lasers, whose frequency

noise is extremely low, could be beneﬁcial [31, 32]. On the contrary, DBR laser

diodes, whose linewidth is typically a few MHz, are not recommended.

According to equation (11), the sensitivity may be improved by using longer

Raman pulses. On the other hand, when the duration τR is larger, the velocity
selectivity of the pulses becomes more stringent. Then the contribution of

useful atoms to the signal is smaller, and the detection noise is larger. Even for

the lowest temperatures one can reach with σ+

σ− cooling, the increase of τR
reduces either the the contrast when no primary velocity selection is performed,

−

or the number of atoms in the measurement. Ultra-cold atoms, obtained by

7

evaporative or sideband cooling, would be of interest [33, 34].

The sensitivity can also be improved by bringing the mirror closer to the

atoms. Presently, our mirror is located at the bottom of the experiment, out

of the magnetic shields. Ultimately the mirror could be installed inside the

vacuum chamber, very close to the atoms.

In this ideal situation, the laser

propagation delay cannot be considered constant for the three pulses anymore.

The maximum delay scales as the trajectory length, which is proportional to
T 2. On the other hand, the sensitivity to inertial forces also scales as T 2 when
going to large interaction times. Hence, the sensitivity limit on the inertial mea-

surement induced by the propagation delay, does not depend on T for ground

instruments. The situation is more favorable for space based instruments [32]

where the distance between the atoms and the retro-reﬂection mirror would

scale like the separation of the wavepackets, meaning only like T .

5.2

Inﬂuence on gradiometers measurement

The formalism developed here could ﬁnally be useful to determine the ulti-

mate performances of cold atom gradiometers. In such experiments, two atomic

clouds are spatially separated and realize simultaneously gravity measurements

[17, 35]. Most of the phase noise contributions are rejected thanks to the dif-

ferential measurement, when the clouds experience the same Raman lasers.

However, as the lasers propagation delays are not the same for the two spaced

interferometers, the laser frequency noise do not cancel. Let us consider the

simple case where the atomic sample S2 is very close to the retro-reﬂection mir-

ror, whereas the other S1 is half a meter above. While the phase noise induced
by the laser L′
2 propagation is negligible for S2, for the other sample S1 this
phase noise contribution would reach the 2.4 mrad/shot that we calculated for

a single sample located at L = 93/2 cm, with our laser setup. A remarkable

point is that this phase noise contribution scales like the distance L = ctd/2,
just like the sensitivity of the gradiometer measurement. Hence there would be

no advantage in increasing the separation between the samples, as long as one

do not increase the interaction time 2T .

In the more common conﬁguration where the samples are given the same

initial velocity, the distance d between them remains constant during their

trajectories. It is then quite straightforward that the gradiometer phase noise

induced by the lasers propagation delays only depend on the separation d.

Thus the sensitivity limit is also given by the equation 10, with td = 2d/c. The
variance in the case of a white frequency noise is then:

σ2
Φ ≈

π2
τR

d2
c2 S0

ν1

(12)

Using our experimental setup, with the parameters mentioned before, the best
sensitivity would be thus 60 E/√Hz (1E = 10−9 s−2). Let us consider now an
atomic fountain conﬁguration with a vertical separation d = 1 m of the two

samples, and a trajectory height of 1 meter too (see ﬁgure 6). This trajectory

is obtained for an initial velocity of 4 m/s, and the apogee is reached after a

time interval of 450 ms, which deﬁnes the interaction time T . A laser linewidth

8

as small as 500 Hz (corresponding to a white frequency noise of about Sν =
160 Hz2/Hz) would allow to obtain a stability measurement of 1 E/√Hz (for a
standard pulse duration τR = 10 µs).

6 Conclusion

We have investigated the inﬂuence of the optical propagation delays on the

phase noise of an atom interferometer based on two photon transitions. The

transfer function for the laser frequency ﬂuctuations has been calculated and

measured for various optical paths with our cold atom gravimeter. Quantitative

measurements of the interferometer sensitivity have also been performed, which

show that the laser frequency noise can limit the sensitivity of the interferome-

ter. We therefore suggest that a necessary eﬀort must be placed to reduce the

laser frequency noise. Thus for experiments where vibrations are not the main

limitations, for instance in the case of space applications, integrated DFB or

DBR lasers are not recommended. We apply the present formalism to the case

of atomic gradiometers, where the other sources of interferometer phase noise

are rejected. A model is proposed to estimate the required frequency laser noise

in order to reach a given sensitivity. This work presents interest for spaceborne

experiments as well, where interaction times can be much longer, and where

the eﬀect of the lasers propagation could constitute a technical limitation.

Figure 1: Experimental scheme of the cold atom gravimeter. The two Raman lasers

L1 and L2 are guided from the optical bench to the atoms by the same optical ﬁber,

and the resonant counter-propagating beams are obtained by retro-reﬂecting the

lasers with the mirror at the bottom of the vacuum chamber. Due to the Doppler
shift of the falling atoms, only L1 and L′
quarter wave plate.

2 can drive the Raman transitions. QWP:

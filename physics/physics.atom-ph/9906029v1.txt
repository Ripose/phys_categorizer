We present a new convergent strong coupling expansion
for two-level atoms in external periodic ﬁelds, free of secular
terms. As a ﬁrst application, we show that the coherent de-
struction of tunnelling is a third-order eﬀect. We also present
an exact treatment of the high-frequency region, and compare
it with the theory of averaging. The qualitative frequency
spectrum of the transition probability amplitude contains an
eﬀective Rabi frequency.

The advent of strong laser pulses has stimulated in-
terest in strong-coupling expansions in quantum optics
and quantum electrodynamics.
Such expansions are
also of considerable general conceptual interest in several
branches of physics. However, particularly in the case of
periodic and quasi-periodic perturbations, the usual se-
ries, e.g., the Dyson series, are plagued by secular terms,
leading to a violation of unitarity when the expansion is
truncated at any order. In addition, small denominators
appear in the quasi-periodic case (see the discussion in
the introduction in [1]). These problems have been for-
mally solved in a nice letter by W. Scherer [2] and in
the papers which followed [3,4]. The main shortcoming
in these works is that convergence was not controlled,
an admittedly diﬃcult enterprise. By writing an Ansatz
in exponential form, and “renormalizing” the exponential
inductively, we were able to eliminate completely the sec-
ular terms and to prove convergence in the special case
of a two-level atom subject to a periodic perturbation,
described by the Hamiltonian [5]

H1(t) = ǫσ3 − f (t)σ1.

The corresponding Schr¨odinger equation is

i∂tΨ(t) = H1(t)Ψ(t),

adopting ~ = 1 for simplicity. Above f (t) is of the form

f (t) =

with Fn = F
n, since f is real, and σi are the Pauli
matrices satisfying [σ1, σ2] = 2iσ3 plus cyclic permuta-
tions. Assuming Fn of order one, the situation where ǫ
is “small” characterizes the strong coupling domain.

It is convenient to perform a time-independent unitary
rotation of π/2 around the 2-axis in (1), replacing H1(t)
by

H2(t) = ǫσ1 + f (t)σ3

and the Schr¨odinger equation by

i∂tΦ(t) = H2(t)Φ(t),

(4)

(5)

with Φ(t) = exp(−iπσ2/4)Ψ(t).

The following result was proved in [1]. Let f be con-
tinuously diﬀerentiable and g be a particular solution of
the generalized Riccati equation

g′ − ig2 − 2if g + iǫ2 = 0.

similar idea was used by F. Bloch and A. Siegert in [6].
For ǫ ≡ 0 a solution of (6) is given by exp
.
Thus, in the above Ansatz we are searching for solutions
(cid:17)
in terms of an “eﬀective external ﬁeld” of the form f + g,
with g vanishing for ǫ = 0. It is thus natural to pose

for n ≥ 3, where the αn are arbitrary integration con-

chosen inductively in order to cancel the secular terms.
For instance, in order to cancel the secular term in c2
in (15), the integrand cannot contain a constant term,
which equals the mean-value term

(18)

It was proved in [1] that one may proceed in this way
and establish the absence of secular terms of any order.
Similar results are valid if (17) is not satisﬁed.

In the quasi-periodic case we were not able to show
convergence in (11), and, in fact, it is not expected [1].
Hence, (11) is to be viewed as a formal power series. In
the periodic case (3) much stronger results are possible,
as we now discuss.

In reference [7] we have proven the following result: for
f periodic the ǫ-expansion (11) has a nonzero radius of
convergence. Our estimate for this radius is not optimal
and we refrain from quoting it here, but we remark that
the expansion does converge for high frequencies, i.e.,
ω ≫ ǫ, a condition that we assume in the following.

ization, i.e., no tunnelling. This is not the case here, as
we shall see.

Fig. 1 shows the exact result for |A21(t)|2 to ﬁfth order
in ǫ for about 12 cycles of ω. We see clearly the domina-
tion of the external frequency ω, in agreement with the
theory of averaging. Eq. (5) may be transformed to

we see that in this case the spectrum is dominated by
the harmonics of the frequency ω of the external ﬁeld,
in agreement with Fig. 1. Notice, however, that, while
averaging is applicable to times up to O(1/ǫ), the exact
theory is applicable to all times. Applying the averaging

Notice that by (19), (20), (22) and (26) Ω(ǫ) ≃ ǫJ0(χ),
to ﬁrst order in ǫ. Thus, the ﬁrst order contribution
approaches zero if χ approaches one of the zeros of the
Bessel function J0. The second order contribution to Ω is

and is non-zero if χ coincides with one of the zeros of
J0. Hence, when 2/ω approaches one of the zeros of the
Bessel function J0 the lowest non-vanishing contribution
to Ω is of third order in ǫ and, hence, rather small. This
means that for such values of ω the tunnelling is very
heavily, although not exactly, suppressed.

Hampering and destruction of tunnelling have been
studied in [10,11] for particles, and in [12,13] for spins.
The latter use the method of averaging, but we empha-
size that in the case treated above, ω ≫ ǫ is satisﬁed
for ǫ suﬃciently small, and thus the result is exact, i.e.,
valid for all times. In addition, the features regarding the
order of the expansion are new.

At resonance ω = 2ǫ we are not able to prove that the
expansion converges.
It is, nevertheless, a well-deﬁned
formal expansion, in contrast to strong-coupling approx-
imations of Keldish type, which are beset with diﬃculties
(see, e.g. [14] and references given there). Moreover, as
we shall show, it includes interesting eﬀects of dressing of
the atoms by the photon ﬁeld (in the semi-classical ap-
proximation) which yields the external ﬁeld Floquet de-
scription, rigorously justiﬁed in [15]. Such eﬀects appear
in the rotating-wave-approximation (RWA) in the form of
a Rabi frequency (see, e.g. [15]), but the present model is
not close to RWA, since the rotating and counter-rotating
terms in (1) are of the same order of magnitude. More-
over, the RWA is not justiﬁed for large coupling, but the
solution of (5) might have some similarity to the solution
obtained when the RWA is performed. If so, the eﬀec-
tive frequency of oscillation of A21 would not diﬀer much
from the Rabi frequency (see [15])

for ω ≃ 2ǫ (or, in general, for ω = O(ǫ) and ǫ small).
Indeed, ΩR makes its appearance in (24) in a most inter-
esting way: by (19)-(20)-(23) and (26), Hn in R(∞, t)
equals, to ﬁrst order in ǫ,

The qualitative behaviour is the same for other values
of t. We see from Fig. 3 that mainly only small n and
n around 2/ω contribute. The eﬀect of adding in the
second order contribution is negligible for the range of
values of ǫ considered.

In conclusion, the new strong-coupling expansion al-
lows considerable insight into both the high-frequency
and resonance regimes, and yields an interesting unex-
pected result for the coherent destruction of tunnelling.

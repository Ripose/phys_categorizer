In this work we reexamine quantum electrodynamics of atomic eletrons in the

Coulomb gauge in the dipole approximation and calculate the shift of atomic

energy levels in the context of Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji

(DDC) formalism by considering the variation rates of physical observables.

We then analyze the physical interpretation of the ordering of operators in

the dipole approximation interaction Hamiltonian in terms of ﬁeld ﬂuctua-

tions and self-reaction of atomic eletrons, discussing the arbitrariness in the

statistical functions in second order bound-state perturbation theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

In radiative processes, the ordering problem of atomic and ﬁeld operators in the interac-

tion Hamiltonian of bound state QED has been raised since the works by Senitzki, Milloni

and others [1]. Behind this discussion is the physical interpretation of atomic radiative ef-

fects such as the radiative line shifts in spontaneous emission. Alternative approaches were

proposed in order to elucidate important issues concerning such problem. Among them are

those based on the complementarity between radiation reaction and vacuum ﬂuctuation ef-

fects, which provide a conceptual basis for the physical interpretation of diﬀerent radiative

processes.

In the Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji (DDC) formulation, the ordering

between the operators of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, considered as a reservoir (

), and a

R

microscopic atomic system (

) play a fundamental role in the identiﬁcation of the respective

S

contributions due to the reservoir ﬂuctuation (fr) and the self-reaction (sr) [2] [3]. They

showed that the symmetric ordering gives a true physical meaning to the (fr) and (sr) rates.

In this letter we explore the DDC construct in order to stablish a connection between

two distinct treatments, investigating the dependence of the energy shifts on a more general

ordering, both in the eﬀective Hamiltonian and in the density matrix approaches.

II. THE EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN FORMULATION

In the dipole approximation, the Hamiltonian of the global system

+

is given by

S

R

H = HS + HR + V,

(1)

where HS is the Hamiltonian of the microscopic system

, HR the Hamiltonian of the

reservoir

and V the interaction between

and

, which we assume to be of the form

S

S

R

V =

gRS (g is the coupling constant and R and S are, respectively, Hermitian observables

R

−
and

of

R

).

S

2

The rate of variation for an arbitrary Hermitian observable G of

is given by the

S

Heisenberg equation of motion, and the contribution of the coupling V to this rate can be

writen as

dG
dt !coupling

 

=

¯h

−

[R(t)S(t), G(t)] = gλN(t)R(t) + g(1

λ)R(t)N(t),

(2)

−

where N(t) =

(i/¯h)[S(t), G(t)] is an Hermitian observable of the microscopic system and

−
λ an arbitrary real number [3].

In the above equation we have used the freedom in the

ordering of R(t) and N(t), since they commute.

In order to obtain the contributions of reservoir ﬂuctuation (rf) and self-reaction (sr) we

perform the following replacement

X(t) = X f(t) + X s(t),

(3)

(X = R, S, G) where Rf (resp. Sf and Gf ) is the solution, to order 0 in g, of the Heisenberg

equation of motion for R (resp. S and G), corresponding to a free evolution between t0 and

t, and Rs(t) (resp. Ss and Gs) the solution to ﬁrst order and higher in g. Then, substituting

(3) in (2) and retaining terms up to second order in g, we obtain

Since the rates (4) and (5) contain only free operators, their average value in the reservoir

state σR gives1

in the absorption and emission operators of the ﬁeld.

The second line of expression (10) (resp. (11)) describes the non-Hamiltonian part of the

A. The Energy Shifts: Hamiltonian Part

Corrections (12) and (13) to the Hamiltonian HS aﬀect

through a shifting in its

energy eingenstates. Hence, considering a state

(which is an eigenstate of HS) we have

From expression (13) for (Hef f )sr, we can follow the same steps as those from (17) to (20).

Formulas (24) and (25) give us the energy shifts which, a priori, depends on λ through

the “correlation functions”, expressions (8) and (23). In the next section we use this result

to make a connection between the previous approach and that adopted in [4], where the

density matrix formulation is employed.

III. THE DENSITY MATRIX FORMULATION

The same energy shifts given by (24) and (25) can also be obtained using a matrix

approach based on the evolution equation for the density operator of the global system

in the interaction picture with respect to HS + HR. Following [4], the energy shift

In the original formulation, given in [4], the physical meaning of the above expressions

was simple and clear in terms of (fr) and (sr) eﬀects. However, since the Hermicity of

expressions (33) and (34) is lost due to the λ’s appearence in the correlations, we don’t have

such simple interpretation. But, it must be noted that if we choose λ = 1/2 the original

results are recovered. In addition, it can be show that despite the λ’s presence in C, its

eﬀect on ∆a is null [7].

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work we have applied to the original formulation of DDC construct a more general

ordering between the atomic and electromagnetic ﬁeld operators and calculate the energy

shift due to the eﬀective Hamiltonian part. The result showed that the freedom in ordering

expression (2) reﬂects in the energy shifts (24) and (25) through the λ’s appearance in the

correlation functions. Such dependence enables us to stablish a formal connection with the

density matrix formulation, where, instead of an arbitrary ordering of operators, we have

made use of a simple mathematical identity.

It must be also noted that our procedure still permit us to ﬁx a posteriori a suitable

ordering which keeps its (rf) and (sr) interpretation, as can be seen by looking directly to

expressions (33) and (34). Further, it can be shown that for a practical case (the Lamb shift

and the AC Stark eﬀect) the energy shifts (24) and (25), or (33) and (34), give the same

contribuction, independent of the ordering we choose [7].

Once we get a better understanding on the arbitrariness in the operator ordering in

DDC construct, we expect to ﬁnd a direct connection with the works by Senitzki, Milloni

and others. The main ideia is constructing a similar structure in the Fock space.

Another interesting application of the present formalism is a possible generalization of

the operator ordering in the spirit of q-deformed operator algebras, subject of a forthcoming

work.

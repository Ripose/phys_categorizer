We present a new method of laser frequency locking in which the feedback signal is directly
proportional to the detuning from an atomic transition, even at detunings many times the natural
linewidth of the transition. Our method is a form of sub-Doppler polarization spectroscopy, based
on measuring two Stokes parameters (I2 and I3) of light transmitted through a vapor cell. This
extends the linear capture range of the lock loop by up to an order of magnitude and provides
equivalent or improved frequency discrimination as other commonly used locking techniques.

PACS numbers:

Laser frequency locking is the process of controlling
a laser’s frequency, relative to some physical reference,
by means of feedback. Various physical references may
be used, for example cavities or atomic transitions [1],
and the methods described here apply equally well in
both cases. In this work we focus on the spectroscopy of
hyperﬁne transitions in Rb atomic vapor which is relevant
to work on ultra-cold atoms.

Experiments in atomic physics often require lasers to
be locked precisely to a known atomic transition. Satu-
rated absorption, and polarization spectroscopy, are two
well known techniques which allow this to be achieved
[1]. Both rely on counter propagating pump and probe
beams to measure a single longitudinal velocity group of
atoms within a Doppler broadened proﬁle. In the case of
saturation spectroscopy, the laser may be locked to the
side of an absorption peak [2] by direct comparison of a
photodetector signal with a reference voltage, however it
is generally desirable to lock to the top of a peak. This
may be achieved by dithering the laser frequency around
a peak and performing lock-in detection [3], which pro-
vides a derivative signal of the transmission. This has
a zero crossing at top of the peak which is convenient
for locking. Polarization spectroscopy is somewhat more
attractive as it produces a narrow, sub-Doppler spec-
trum with a natural zero crossing at resonance [4] with-
out the need for dithering (which can broaden the laser
linewidth) and lock-in detection [5].

Pearman et al. have studied a form of polarization
spectroscopy locking in detail in [6]. Their method cor-
responds to a measure of the circular birefringence (dif-
ferential refractive index for orthogonal polarizations) of
an atomic sample which is induced by a circularly polar-
ized pump beam. The locking signal is linear over a range
approximately equal to the power broadened linewidth of
the transition (typically 10 - 20 MHz in rubidium vapors).
The method we present incorporates this along with a
measure of the circular dichroism (diﬀerential absorption
for two orthogonal polarizations) which greatly extends
the linear region of the lock signal. Our method stems
from the proposal of Harvey and White [7] which is best
understood by analyzing the Stokes parameters of the
transmitted probe light.

We wish to quantify the change in the polarization

state of an input laser beam in terms of the anisotropic
properties of the sample. As the anisotropy is deﬁned in
terms of circular polarizations, we choose to express the
total electric ﬁeld in the right-left (R-L) circular basis:
E = (cid:2) ER
EL (cid:3) where ER and EL are the right and left cir-
cular electric ﬁeld components respectively. In this basis
the (unnormalized) Stokes parameters are,

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

I0 = |ER|2 + |EL|2,
I1 = 2|ER||EL| cos φ,
I2 = 2|ER||EL| sin φ,
I3 = |ER|2 − |EL|2,
where φ = φR − φL is the phase diﬀerence between the
right and left circular components. Equations 1 - 4 are
equivalent to the familiar expressions in the horizontal-
vertical (H-V ) basis, and could also be written in
the diagonal-antidiagonal (D-A) basis. The normalized
Stokes parameters, Si, are obtained from the ratio Ii/I0.
We recall the physical meaning of these, I0 is the total
irradiance, I1, I2 and I3 are measures of the horizontal,
diagonal and right circular polarizations, respectively [8].
With this in mind it is straightforward to design detec-
tors for each of the Stokes parameters consisting of: for I1
a polarizing beamsplitter cube and two photodetectors;
I2 a λ/2 plate and an I1 detector; and I3 a λ/4 plate
and an I1 detector. Figure 1 shows this schematically.
I0 is given by the sum of the two photodetector signals
for any of the above Ii measurements. In all cases the

beamsplitter separates the horizontal and vertical com-
ponents, which are then measured and subtracted. The

waveplates convert (D-A) to (H-V ) to measure I2 and
(R-L) to (H-V ) to measure I3 respectively.

We return now to the proposal of Harvey and White
in which a measure of the phase diﬀerence between two
orthogonal ﬁeld components, provides a feedback signal
which may be used to lock a laser [7].
In the circular
basis, the phase diﬀerence, φ, between the left and right
handed components can be obtained from equations 2
and 3. Evaluating the arctangent of the ratio of the
measured Stokes parameters S2/S1 yields a direct mea-
sure of φ. In practice, calculating the arctangent in real
time would require a digital signal processor. However,
for small phase shifts, tan φ ≈ sin φ ≈ φ and I2 provides
a signal proportional to φ. In polarization spectroscopy
[6], the small angle approximation is valid, and a sig-
nal directly proportional to φ can be obtained simply by
measuring the single Stokes component, I2. The shape
of the expected I2 signal is given by [6],

I2(x) ∝ ∆n(x) =

∆α0
k

x
1 + x2 ,

where x is the laser detuning from resonance in units of
the power broadened transition linewidth, k is the (reso-
nant) wavenumber of the laser, n(x) is the real part of the
refractive index of the vapor and ∆α0 is the diﬀerence in
absorption at line center of the two circular components
of the probe. This signal is dispersion shaped and free
of a Doppler broadened background (both left and right
handed components experience equal Doppler broadened
absorptions and this is removed in the subtraction).

The phase shift of equation 5 depends only on ∆α0,
the diﬀerential absorption at line center. This diﬀerence
originates from an anisotropy induced in atoms which
have interacted with the circularly polarized pump laser.
Atoms are optically pumped into one of the extreme mag-
netic states, say mF = +F . The diﬀerential absorption,
∆α of the two circular components of the probe ﬁeld
is maximized in this case.
In the 5S1/2 F = 2, mF = 2
ground state of 87Rb the diﬀerence in oscillator strengths
for σ+ and σ− transitions is 15:1. The σ+ component
experiences enhanced absorption and the σ− decreased
absorption with respect to the Doppler background. As
the Doppler broadened absorption is the same for both
components the diﬀerential absorption proﬁle is given by
the Lorentzian,

I3(x) ∝ ∆α(x) =

(6)

∆α0
1 + x2 ,

which is related to equation 5 by the Kramers-Kronig
dispersion relation [1]. Equation 6 is simply the diﬀerence
in absorption of left and right handed circular component
(circular dichroism) which is equivalent to I3 of equation
4.
Inspection of equations 5 and 6 reveals that their

provides a signal directly proportional to x which does
not decay as 1/(1 + x2) at large detunings. In the polar-
ization locking of [6], I2 is used as the error signal and
a controller provides feedback signal to the laser which
drives this to zero. I2(x) is linear for small x but not
at large detunings where it approaches zero. Our locking
method compensates for this by dividing (5) by (6) which
greatly extends the linear region of the locking signal.

We have implemented this method spectroscopically
and constructed a simple control circuit for locking. Fig-
ure 2 is a schematic of our apparatus. We choose for our
experiments the 5S1/2 F = 2 → 5P3/2 F ′ = 1, 2, 3 transi-
tion at 780.1nm in 87Rb. Light is provided by a 90 mW
Rohm RLD78PZW1 diode laser in an external cavity con-
ﬁguration similar to that described in [9]. Four photode-

FIG. 2: Experimental setup for polarization quotient lock-
ing. A small fraction of light is split oﬀ the laser output and
sent into a polarization spectrometer. The I2 and I3 Stokes
parameters of the probe light are measured and used to pro-
vide feedback to lock the laser. BS = beam splitter, PBS =
polarizing BS, NPBS = 50/50 non-polarizing BS.

tectors at the output of the optical apparatus are con-
nected to an analogue circuit which performs the neces-
sary subtractions and division in real time. The output
of this device, either the polarization spectroscopy signal
I2, or the quotient I2/I3, is fed into the laser lock cir-
cuit which provides feedback to the laser frequency via
the injection current and piezoelectric transducer (PZT).
Additionally, the lock circuit has a diﬀerential input to
which we can apply an oﬀset voltage which shifts the
lock point away from zero volts. Spectra were obtained
as the laser frequency was scanned across the transition
by applying a triangular voltage ramp to the PZT. Fig-
ure 3 shows the results of such a scan. The upper trace
is a saturated absorption spectrum, followed by the raw
I2 and I3 scans. The lower trace shows the quotient,
Q(x), obtained from the analogue divider. The horizon-
tal scale is obtained from the known energy level spacings
of 87Rb in zero magnetic ﬁeld. These plots show that our
method greatly extends the capture range of the lock.
The normalized gradients of the quotient I2/I3 = S2/S3
and S2 = I2/I0 spectrum are the same at x = 0 but Q(x)
retains this value at large detunings.

As I3 approaches zero Q(x) becomes sensitive to elec-
tronic noise on the photodetector signals. We overcome
this by low-pass ﬁltering the output of the analogue di-

our scheme, such frequency steps can be achieved sim-
ply by applying a DC oﬀset voltage at the input to the
lock circuit. Figure 4 shows an example of this by plot-
ting the step responses of a laser locked using regular
I2 polarization spectroscopy, and our quotient method.
With I2 locking, we can repeatably jump the laser up
to 15 MHz in under 200 µs. Larger steps may take the
laser oﬀ the lock slope and cause it to relock at another
zero crossing. Using quotient locking however, we can
jump from -70 MHz back to resonance in approximately
the same time, making this technique very versatile for
application to laser cooling experiments. Similar jumps
above resonance can also be achieved.

bandwidth of the lock loop, the linewidth and long term
stability of lasers locked with both I2 and I2/I3 feedback
signals were similar (< 1 MHz) as determined by moni-
toring the error signals.

The linear region of the I2 only locking signal extends
over 20 MHz. Our Q(x) signal on the other hand, ex-
tends monotonically over a 200 MHz range as indicated
by the shaded regions in ﬁgure 3. On the left, it is limited
by the proximity of the nearest crossover resonance, and
on the right only by the supply voltage to the analogue
controller. This increase in range helps in two important
ways. Firstly, it means the laser can sustain much larger
perturbations without coming out of lock and secondly,
it makes it possible to apply large and precise frequency
steps without leaving the lock slope.

In laser cooling and Bose-Einstein condensate exper-
iments it is often necessary to jump the frequency of a
laser so that it can be used for multiple tasks. For ex-
ample, a compressed magneto-optical trap (MOT) or po-
larization cooling stage can be achieved by shifting the
MOT laser frequency from a detuning of ≈ -12 MHz to
≈ -50 MHz.
Ideally this would happen on a time scale
of order 1 ms. Acousto-optical modulators can be used
for this but a simpler method would be preferable. With

locking after switching the DC lock point voltage at t = 0.
Solid lines show the measured error signal after switching and
the dashed lines show the ideal response. Q(x) locking allows
much larger jumps to be achieved without unlocking the laser.

In summary, we have seen that for a Lorentzian tran-
sition, the ratio of the dispersion and absorption spec-
tra yields a measurement of detuning. Polarization spec-
troscopy obtains a Doppler-free dispersion spectrum by
measuring the unnormalized Stokes parameter I2. A sim-
ilar measurement can yield the parameter I3 which pro-
vides a Doppler-free measurement of the diﬀerential ab-
sorption. Combining these produces a spectroscopic mea-
surement proportional to detuning ideal for use in laser
locking which extends the capture region of the lock by
up to a factor of ten. This results in a very robust lock
and allows us to make rapid and precise jumps of the
laser frequency of up to 70 MHz either side of resonance.

Abstract

We outline the solution of a fundamental problem in quantum theory which has hitherto

lacked a proper solution, namely ﬁnding the requisite quantum theoretical framework

guaranteeing that the calculated inverse spontaneous emission rate of a moving atom,

as a composite system of charged particles interacting with the Maxwell ﬁeld, is slowed

down exactly as in time dilation.

It has recently been shown that a neutral atom bearing an electric dipole moment

moving in an external magnetic ﬁeld can accumulate a quantum phase [1-5]. A mov-

ing dipole may, under suitable conditions, exhibit a detectable Aharonov-Bohm phase

shift [6] and the rotational motion of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a vortex state can

induce a magnetic monopole [7,8] distribution or an electric charge distribution [8].

These and other eﬀects associated with atomic motion continue to receive considerable

attention and especially so with the advent of atom optics [9,10] and laser cooling and

trapping [11]. At ﬁrst sight it would appear that the requisite theory for the descrip-

tion of pheneomena involving moving atoms could be constructed as a straightforward

extension of non-relativistic quantum optics by incorporating the translational motion

of the atomic centre of mass.

In fact the need to incorporate the centre of mass motion in quantum optics theory

had necessitated a re-appraisal of the corresponding non-relativistic quantum electrody-

namical theory where investigations sought to elucidate how the division of the motion

into centre of mass and internal motions is aﬀected by the presence of the interaction

with electromagnetic ﬁelds [12-15]. One of the main outcomes of these investigations

was the emphasis on the role of the R¨ontgen interaction [16] energy term which cou-

ples the electric dipole moment to an eﬀective electric ﬁeld involving the centre of mass

velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld of the light.

It was Wilkens [17] who pointed out that a theory which excluded the R¨ontgen in-

teraction would lead to spurious velocity-dependent eﬀects when evaluating the sponta-

neous decay rate of an excited electric dipole moving freely in electromagnetic vacuum.

Wilkens extended his work to include the R¨ontgen interaction and evaluated the scat-

tering rate into a given solid angle in a given direction, deducing that this was free

of any spurious velocity-dependences [18]. He did not, however, proceed to ascertain

whether the calculated total spontaneous emission rate based on his approach would

be consistent with the requirements of special relativity. It turns out that Wilken’s

approach in fact leads to an incorrect result for the total rate.

2

More recently, Barton and Calegoracos [19] highlighted the absence in the literature

of a proper treatment of the quantum theory of spontaneous emission of atoms moving

in a classically assigned trajectory. This is so even for the simplest case of a uniformly

moving atom. They put forward a theory in which they considered a model system of

an atom in which the nucleus is the centre of mass and merely provides the Coulomb

potential binding it to the electron and this system was assumed to be interacting only

with the scalar ﬁeld as a simpliﬁed representative of the Maxwell ﬁeld. In addition to

these simpliﬁcations, their theory called for a careful distinction between energies and

Hamiltonians. As far as the authors are aware, a workable theoretical framework of the

problem in which a real atom interacts with the full (vector) Maxwell ﬁeld is hitherto

unknown and it is our purpose here to furnish such a framework.

Our theory makes use of unambiguous canonical techniques; Lorentz transforma-

tions and a gauge transformation are two of its ingredients.

It turns out that not

only the R¨ontgen interaction features prominently in the theory, but that modiﬁed

atomic internal energy levels and eigenfunctions, which produce an expected Doppler

shift, play important roles in the characteristics of the emission process. Finally, one

needs to distinguish carefully between projections of vector ﬁelds parallel and trans-

verse to the atomic velocity vector. These diﬀerent aspects of the problem conspire

in a remarkable manner leading to the correct result, namely that the inverse total

spontaneous rate of the moving atom follows the time dilation formula, as required by

special relativity.

The model of a real atom we consider here involves two oppositely charged particles

of charges e1 = −e2 = e and ﬁnite masses m1 and m2. In the centre of mass frame

(atomic frame) we denote the position vectors of the two particles by q′

1 and q′

2, and

the electromagnetic scalar and vector potentials as φ′(r′) and A′(r′), respectively. The

Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic ﬁeld including the interaction with the two

charged particles is

L′ =

where the electric ﬁeld is E′(r′) = −( ˙A′(r′) + ∇′φ′(r′)), the magnetic ﬁeld is B′(r′) =

∇′ × A′(r) and the current and charge densities of the particles are given, respectively,

by

J′(r′) = e [ ˙q′

2δ(r′ − q′

2)]

ρ′(r′) = e [δ(r′ − q′

1) − δ(r′ − q′

2)]

The notation is such that the atomic frame (the rest-frame) is referred to as S′ and

all quantities relative to this frame are primed. The laboratory frame is the unprimed

frame and will be referred to as S, relative to which the atomic centre of mass moves

at velocity ˙R, and all quantities relative to S are unprimed.

The Langrangian density in Eq.(1) can be recast in terms of the primed centre of

mass coordinates, deﬁned by

R′ =

(m1q′

1 + m2q′
2)
M

;

q′ = q′

1 − q′

where M = m1 + m2 is the atomic mass. Note that in the primed frame, or rest-frame,

we must have ˙R′ = 0, by deﬁnition. This allows us to carry out a Power-Zienau-Woolley

gauge transformation [20] and straightforwardly obtain the new Langragian density

L′ =

( ˙A′(r′) + ∇′φ′(r′))2 − c2(∇′ × A′(r′))2

µν is the well known electromagnetic ﬁeld 4-tensor [21]

and G′

µν is the polarisation ﬁeld 4-tensor [22]. Formally G′µν has the same form as F ′µν

but with the substitutions E′ → P ′ and cB′ → −M′/c.

Lorentz invariance allows us to write the Lagrangian density in the unprimed (lab-

oratory) frame S exactly as in Eq.(8), or Eq.(5), simply by removing the primes. The

total Lagrangian in the unprimed frame can now be written by adding the familiar

relativistic Lagrangian contributions from the two particles as follows

where γ( ˙q) = (1 − ˙q2/c2)−1/2; the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are given by E(r) =

− ˙A(r) − ∇φ(r) and B(r) = ∇ × A(r).

It is important to bear in mind that the

unprimed polarisation and magnetisation ﬁelds P(r) and M(r) appearing in Eq.(9)

are not those in Eqs.(6) and (7). The primed polarisation and magnetisation ﬁelds are

rest properties and the unprimed ones are related to them by relativistic connection

rules involving a Lorentz transformation of the polarisation ﬁeld 4-tensor Gµν [22]. The

interaction Lagrangian density (the last two terms in Eq.(9)) can thus be rewritten in

terms of the primed polarisation and magnetisation by direct substitution as follows,

where the subscript k (⊥) denotes the vector projection parallel (perpendicular) to

˙R and γ = γ( ˙R). Note that in Eq.(10) the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have been

left untransformed and we have emphasised the dependence on the space arguments r

and r′ which are connected by the Lorentz coordinate transformation equations. The

term in Eq.(10) involving the velocity, electric polorisation and the magnetic B ﬁeld is

identiﬁed as the R¨ontgen Lagrangian interaction term [12-16], while the term involving

the velocity, magnetisation and the electric ﬁeld is identiﬁed as the Aharonov-Casher

term [8,23].

Having expressed the interaction Lagrangian in terms of the known rest atomic

properties P ′ and M′, we now turn to the particle Lagrangian terms (given by the

ﬁrst two terms in Eq.(9)) and seek to express their sum in terms of the unprimed centre

of mass and relative velocities, ˙R and ˙q, respectively, using the relations

˙q1 = ˙R +

m2

˙q;

˙q2 = ˙R −

(11)

Concentrating on the unprimed (S) frame we now make use of the fact that the internal

dynamics of the atom are not aﬀected by relativistic considerations other than through

˙R (i.e. the motion of the electron round the nucleus is essentially non-relativistic). We

may then expand the sum of the particle Lagrangian terms up to terms quadratic in ˙q

to obtain

where µ = m1m2/M is the reduced mass.

After making use of Eqs.(10) and (12), the new Lagrangian emerging from Eq.(9)

now becomes the starting point of the canonical procedure with R and q as the canon-

ical variables for the atom and A(r) and φ(r) for the ﬁelds. The canonical momenta

are P (conjugate to R), p (conjugate to q) and Π(r), which is identiﬁed as −D(r), the

electric displacement ﬁeld, is the momentum conjugate to A(r), while the momentum

conjugate to φ is zero. Since we are interested in spontaneous emission by an atom

characterised by an electric dipole moment, we may now ignore magnetic interactions

by setting all terms involving M to zero. The ﬁnal Hamiltonian emerging from the

canonical procedure can be written as a sum of three terms as follows

In Eq.(14) H 0

a is identiﬁed as the unperturbed atomic Hamiltonian and is seen to be

clearly divisible into a centre of mass part and an internal part and we should note the

appearance of the relativistic factor γ in the latter. The potential U(q) in Eq.(14) is the

inter-particle Coulomb potential in the unprimed (laboratory) frame. In the primed

frame (rest-frame) the inter-particle Coulomb potential, denoted as U ′(q′), arises in the

multipolar formulation from an integral term containing the square of the irrotational

part P ′L of the polarisation ﬁeld, together with inﬁnite Coulomb self energies

(17)

On disregarding the inﬁnite Coulomb self energies, one then transforms the inter-

particle Coulomb energy U ′(q′) to obtain U(q), the interaction in the unprimed frame.

The simplest and most direct route is by following the force transformation argument

[24] to obtain

U(q) =

(18)

The expression for H 0

f given in Eq.(15) is the familiar unperturbed ﬁeld Hamilto-

nian which can be quantised following the standard methods of quantisation for a free

ﬁeld in the laboratory frame. Finally, Hint, given in Eq.(16) is a new form of interaction

Hamiltonian which couples the rest polarisation ﬁeld to electromagnetic ﬁelds in the

laboratory frame. Note the division of polarisation in terms of k and ⊥ contributions

and the appearance of the relativistic factor γ, explicitly and also implicitly via Lorentz

transformation from r′ to r. The last set of terms in Hint are identiﬁed as the R¨ontgen

interaction, expressed in a symmetrised form.

In order to describe the spontaneous emission process, we need to solve zero order

eigenproblems for the ﬁelds and for the atom. The ﬁelds can be quantised by following

the standard methods of quantisation based on the Hamiltonian in Eq.(15) in the

laboratory frame. The solution of the atomic eigneproblem involves consideration of

the Schr¨ondinger equation H 0

where, without loss of generality, we have taken the direction of the velocity ˙R to be

Ψ(R, q) = EΨ(R, q)

(19)

the z-direction. Equation (19) admits solutions of the form Ψ(R, q) = eiK.Rψ(q) where

E = ¯h2K 2/2M + ǫ. Upon making the substitution q′

z = γqz we obtain a Sch¨odinger

equation governing the internal states of a hydrogenic atom in the atomic frame (rest-

frame) S′ such that γǫ = ǫ′ where ǫ′ are the internal eigenenergies in the rest-frame

S′.

The corresponding eigenfunction possesses the same formal expression in the two

frames, but note that in the laboratory frame S the position vector would be q not q′

which means that the atom will appear to Lorentz-contract in the direction parallel to

the velocity, as should be expected. It is important to remember that these physically

consistent modiﬁcations to the internal energy levels and eigenfunctions have only

come to light because of the modiﬁed form of the internal kinetic energy term as

well as the Coulomb potential energy terms appearing in Eqs.(14) and (18). Without

the asymmetry due to the presence of γ in the internal kinetic energy terms and the

dependence of the Coulomb potential energy on q′, the familiar spatial symmetry of the

hydrogenic Sch¨ondinger equation would have been lost, leading to angular dependence

and, consequently, to spurious features arising from the lifting of the degeneracy of the

energy levels.

We are now in a position to consider the energy and momentum conservation ac-

companying the process of spontaneous emission of a photon described in the unprimed

(laboratory) frame as having wavevector k and frequency ω when the internal energy

of the atom changes from ǫi to ǫf . Conservation of momentum requires that we have

8

Kf = Ki − k where Ki = M ˙R/¯h is the initial centre of mass wavevector and Kf is the

ﬁnal wavevector in the laboratory frame. Conservation of energy, on the other hand,

demands that we have

where ¯hω′

0 is the energy level diﬀerence in the primed (rest) frame S′ and we have

ignored the second order recoil energy. Note that Eq.(20) is equivalent to a Doppler

shift in the photon frequency.

Two cases in the calculation of the spontaneous emission rate will have to be

considered relative to the laboratory (unprimed) frame S, namely (i) when the dipole

moment vector is parallel to the velocity vector and (ii) when the dipole meoment

vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector. If these two calculations yield exactly

the same result, then the spontaneous emission is deemed to be isotropic i.e. free from

angular dependence. Imposing the electric dipole approximation, P ′(r′) = d′δ(r′ − R′)

where d′ = eq′, we obtain for the transition matrix element squared, with Hint as given

in Eq.(16) as the interaction,

involved and we have written E instead of −Π/ǫ0, anticipating free space quantisation

[25]. The R¨ontgen term contains the average velocity of the atom before and after the

transition due to the symmetrised term in Eq.(16) but we may ignore the momentum

of the photon since this is small compared to the initial momentum of the atom.

The free-space normalised electromagnetic ﬁelds can be obtained straightforwardly,

remembering that we should identify two orthogonal wave polarisations. We choose

the z-direction, i.e. along ˙R, as the axis along which there will be either a magnetic

ﬁeld (i.e. transverse electric or TE) or an electric ﬁeld (i.e. transverse magnetic or

TM). We can then write for a given wavevector k = (k, θ, φ) the following normalised

It is seen that there is no angular

dependence, i.e. the rate of spontaneous emission is isotropic, and it does indeed vary

like a relativistic clock.

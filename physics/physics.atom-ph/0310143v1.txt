We formulate a general method for the study of semiclassical-like dynamics in stable regions of a mixed
phase-space. This involves determining stable Gaussian wavepacket solutions, and then propagating them using
a cumulant-based formalism. We apply our method to the problem of quantum accelerator modes, determining
their relative longevity under diﬀerent parameter regimes, and obtaining good qualitative agreement with exact
wavefunction dynamics.

Semiclassical approaches in quantum chaotic dynamics
have proved very successful in forging conceptual links be-
tween classically chaotic systems and their quantum mechan-
ical counterparts [1]. When trying to include quantum me-
chanical eﬀects, an obvious step beyond point-particle dy-
namics is to consider the evolution of Gaussian wavepack-
ets. Straightforward semiclassical Gaussian wavepacket dy-
namics are limited in that, e.g., the wavepacket is unrealisti-
cally forced to maintain its Gaussian form. Pioneering work
by Huber, Heller, and Littlejohn [2] proposed to remedy this
by allowing complex classical trajectories. These also per-
mit the study of a wider range of classically forbidden pro-
cesses, and the propagation of superpositions of Gaussians.
We propose an alternative and very simple approach, which
is to follow the dynamics of the cumulants of initially Gaus-
sian wavepackets. When taken to second order, the dynam-
ics are described purely in terms of means and variances, as
in a Gaussian wavepacket, but evolution into non-Gaussian
wavepackets is not proscribed. After developing the formal-
ism, we apply it to an exciting development in atom-optical
studies of quantum-nonlinear phenomena: quantum acceler-
ator modes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Quantum accelerator modes
have proved to be a fascinating example of a robust quantum
resonance eﬀect, and the demonstrated coherence of their for-
mation [6] promises important applications in coherent atom
optics [4, 10]. In a conﬁguration consisting of a laser cooled
cloud of freely falling cesium atoms subjected to periodic δ-
like kicks from a vertically oriented oﬀ-resonant laser stand-
ing wave [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], quantum accelerator modes are
characterized experimentally by a momentum transfer, linear
20%) of
with kick number, to a substantial fraction (up to
the initial cloud of atoms. This system is also attractive in
that it is possible to eﬀectively tune its classicality, making it
an ideal testing ground for semiclassical theories. We use our
approach to obtain insight into the relative longevity of these
modes, and present very encouraging results as to its useful-
ness.

We consider two conjugate self-adjoint operators: ˆξ and ˆζ,
such that [ ˆξ, ˆζ] = iη, and a Hamiltonian ˆH( ˆξ, ˆζ). The dynamics
of these operators can be entirely described by their ﬁrst-order
expectation values µξ =

generally consist of a mixture of stable islands based around
stable periodic orbits, and a chaotic sea. As can be seen in Fig.
1, this is exactly the case for our model example, the δ-kicked
accelerator [5].

When considering dynamics near a stable periodic orbit in
the phase space, we utilize: that the local dynamics approx-
imate those of a harmonic oscillator [11], and that Gaussian
wavepackets remain Gaussian when experiencing harmonic
dynamics. This motivates the use of a Gaussian ansatz [12]
of the form [2]

A complete picture of the observable dynamics can only be
determined from the time-evolution of all possible expectation
values of products of the dynamical variables. Except for very
simple systems, this in general produces a complicated hier-
archy of coupled equations. In order to gain any insight we
must determine a truncation scheme to reduce this to a man-
agable description. In a sense this is achieved by the Gaussian
ansatz, which considers only means and variances. Means and
variances are in fact only the ﬁrst two orders of an inﬁnite hi-
erarchy of cumulants [13], which we will denote by double
angle brackets to distinguish them from expectation values.
The non-commutative cumulants can be obtained directly in

terms of operator expectation values through [14]

where the ordered observables have been partitioned in all
possible ways into products of cumulants. Cumulants tend to
become smaller with increasing order, unlike expectation val-
ues; intuitively, higher-order cumulants encode only an “extra
bit” of information that lower-order cumulants have not yet
provided. It is therefore often possible to provide a good de-
scription by systematically truncating, expressing moments of
all orders in terms of cumulants up to some ﬁnite order [14].
Truncating at ﬁrst order is equivalent to considering only
ﬁrst-order expectation values, and thus reproduces the corre-
sponding Hamilton’s equations of motion. It is tempting to
think that truncating at second order is equivalent to enforc-
ing the Gaussian ansatz. This will not in general reproduce
the dynamics given by enforcing the Gaussian ansatz. Gaus-
sian wavepacket dynamics are unitary, meaning that the un-
certainty relation is always exactly observed, and that one
. This is only
need keep track of only two of
true when no terms in the Hamiltonian are of greater than
ˆξ, ˆζ
quadratic order in
[2]. Furthermore, ﬁnding a ﬁxed point
{

is equivalent to ﬁnding an eigenstate of the
of

system which is a perfect Gaussian, which is only true for the
harmonic oscillator.

When propagating the second-order truncated equations of
motion for the ﬁrst and second order cumulants, it is generally
necessary to consider the dynamics of each of
ξζ}
explicitly, as the uncertainty relation is not hard-wired into
the formalism, which it is for the Gaussian ansatz [Eq. (1)].
This implies that the evolution described solely in terms of
the ﬁrst and second order cumulants is not unitary. This is
a feature of our approach which more accurately reﬂects the
fact that truncating generally leaves us with an incomplete de-
scription of the dynamics, with a correspondingly inevitable
loss of information about the state of the system [15].

ζ , σ2

Nonetheless, when situated inside a stable island in

ξ, ζ
}
{
phase space, such a “stable” Gaussian wavepacket should be
long-lived due to the harmonic nature of the local dynamics
[15]. One can then use the equations of motion appropriate to
second-order cumulant dynamics to get an idea of how long-
lived the initial wavepacket actually is, as physically sensible
imperfections are included in the dynamics in a straightfor-
ward manner.

The approach we have described is most obviously applica-
ble in the standard semiclassical regime, but is not restricted
to it. We will illustrate our method by applying it to a very in-
teresting and experimentally relevant system, the quantum δ-
kicked accelerator [5]. Our approach provides useful insights
on the longevity of quantum accelerator modes in this sys-
tems, essential for their possible application in coherent atom
optics [4, 10].

The η is in this case a parameter, ǫ, whose smallness indi-
cates nearness to special resonant kicking frequencies, leading
to the production of quantum accelerator modes [9]. The dy-
namics of the atoms in the Oxford quantum accelerator mode
experiment [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are well modelled by the one-
dimensional δ-kicked accelerator Hamiltonian:

Here ˆz is the position, ˆp the momentum, m the particle mass, g
the gravitational acceleration, t the time, T denotes the pulse
period, G = 2π/λspat where λspat is the spatial period of the
potential applied to the atoms, and ~φd quantiﬁes the depth of
this potential.

The near-fulﬁlment of the quantum resonance condition
(closeness to particular resonant pulse periodicities [4, 16])
means the free evolution of a wavefunction, initially well lo-
calized in momentum and (periodic) position space immedi-
ately after it experiences a kick, causes it to rephase to close
to its initial condition before each subsequent kick. The the-
oretical treatment due to Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini
[9] accounts for this in terms of the so-called ǫ-classical limit,
where a kind of kick-to-kick classical point dynamics is re-
gained in the limit of the pulse periodicity approaching inte-
ger multiples of the half-Talbot time [4] T1/2 = 2πm/~G2, i.e.,
as ǫ = 2π(T/T1/2 −
Z. This accurately
accounts for the observed acceleration for up to
100 kicks,
as well as predicting numerous experimentally observed high-
order accelerator modes [7]. It is this ǫ (not ~) which takes the
place of η in our cumulant-based approach. We now brieﬂy
run through the treatment of Refs. [9] in order to justify the ap-
propriate phase-space which is the starting point of our anal-
ysis, providing enough detail for the explanation to be self-
contained.

This corresponds to a periodic train of shifted Gaussians in
position space. Figure 3 shows the results of these integra-
tions. We see that Fig. 2 reproduces its qualitative features
quite well, especially for smaller values of ǫ and ˜k. More sur-
prising is the replication of a saddle-point feature at around
ǫ =

ǫ that is clearly not an artefact of our approximations.

In conclusion, we have developed a general method for
using second order cumulants to study semiclassical-like
dynamics near stable periodic orbits in phase space. We
have successfully applied this method to quantum accelerator
mode dynamics, which operate in an unusual ǫ-semiclassical
regime, gaining insight into the longevity of quantum acceler-
ator modes in diﬀerent parameter regimes.

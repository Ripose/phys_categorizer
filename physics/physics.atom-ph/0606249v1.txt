We have performed ab initio calculations of the frequency shift induced by a static electric ﬁeld
on the cesium clock hyperﬁne transition. The calculations are used to ﬁnd the frequency shifts due

with early measurements and ab initio calculations performed in other groups. We present argu-
ments against recent claims that the actual value of the eﬀect might be smaller. The diﬀerence (∼
10%) between ab initio and semiempirical calculations is due to the contribution of the continuum
spectrum to the sum over intermediate states.

Atomic clocks are now important for both practical
applications and fundamental physics. One of the domi-
nant uncertainties in high-precision measurements of fre-
quencies in atomic clocks is the ac stark shift induced
[1]). There is some
by blackbody radiation (see e.g.
disagreement on the value of this shift. Early measure-
ments [2, 4, 7] and ab initio calculations [5, 8] support
10−10Hz/(V/m)2 while
a value which is close to
2.2
more recent measurements [10, 11] and semiempirical cal-
culations [3, 9, 12] claim that actual number might be
about 10% smaller.

In the present work we have performed fully ab ini-
tio calculations of the radiation frequency shift and have
identiﬁed the source of the disagreement between diﬀer-
ent theoretical results as the contribution of the contin-
uum spectrum states into summation over the complete
set of intermediate states. The continuum spectrum was
included in all the ab initio calculations and missed in
the semiempirical considerations. We demonstrate that
adding the contribution of the continuum spectrum to
where it was missed brings all theoretical results to good
agreement with each other and with early measurements.

while ǫ is a small correction due to frequency distribution

In the case when there is no other external electric ﬁeld
the radiation shift can be expressed in terms of the scalar
hyperﬁne polarizability of the atom. This corresponds
to averaging over all possible directions of the electric
ﬁeld. The hyperﬁne polarizability is the diﬀerence in the
atomic polarizabilities between diﬀerent hyperﬁne struc-
ture states of the atom. The lowest-order eﬀect is linear
in the hyperﬁne interaction and quadratic in the electric
ﬁeld. The corresponding third-order perturbation theory
expressions, after angular reduction have the form

Ans is the hfs constant of the ns state, Am,n is the oﬀ-
diagonal hfs matrix element, I is nuclear spin, F = I + J,
J is total electron momentum of the atom in the ground
state (J = 1/2), and j is total momentum of virtual p-
states (j = 1/2, 3/2). Summation goes over a complete
set of ns, mp1/2 and mp3/2 states.

In order to calculate frequency shift to the hfs transi-
tions due to the electric ﬁeld one needs to have a com-
plete set of states and to have the energies, electric dipole
transition amplitudes and hyperﬁne structure matrix el-
ements corresponding to these states.
It is possible to
consider summation over the physical states and to then
use experimental data to perform the calculations. The
lowest valence states for which experimental data is usu-
ally available dominate in the summation. Oﬀ-diagonal
hfs matrix elements can be obtained to a high accuracy
as the square root of the product of corresponding hfs
constants: Am,n = √AmAn (see, e.g. [15]). However,
the accuracy of this approach is limited by the need to
include the tail contribution from highly excited states
including states in the continuum. This contribution can
be very signiﬁcant and its calculation is not easier than
the calculation of the whole sum.

Therefore, in the present work we use an ab initio ap-
proach in which high accuracy is achieved by the inclu-
sion of all important many-body and relativistic eﬀects.
We make only one exception toward the semiempirical
approach. The frequency shift is dominated by the term
(8) which is proportional to the hfs in the ground state.
It is natural to use experimental hfs constant in the domi-
nating term to have more accurate results. Note however
that the diﬀerence with complete ab initio calculations is
small.

Calculations start from the relativistic Hartree-Fock
(RHF) method in the V N −1 approximation. This means
that the initial RHF procedure is done for a closed-shell
atomic core with the valence electron removed. After
that, states of the external electron are calculated in the
ﬁeld of the frozen core. Correlations are included by
means of the correlation potential method [16]. We use
two diﬀerent approximations for the correlation poten-
tial, ˆΣ. First, we calculate it in the lowest, second-order
of the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). We use
notation ˆΣ(2) for the corresponding correlation potential.
Then we also include into ˆΣ two classes of the higher-
order terms: screening of the Coulomb interaction and
hole-particle interaction (see, e.g. [17] for details). These
two eﬀects are included in all orders of the MBPT and
the corresponding correlation potential is named ˆΣ(∞).
To calculate ˆΣ(2) we need a complete set of single-
electron orbitals. We use the B-spline technique [18, 19]
to construct the basis. The orbitals are built as linear
combinations of 50 B-splines in a cavity of radius 40aB.
The coeﬃcients are chosen from the condition that the
orbitals are eigenstates of the RHF Hamiltonian ˆH0 of the
closed-shell core. The ˆΣ(∞) operator is calculated with
the technique which combines solving equations for the
Green functions (for the direct diagram) with the summa-

2

tion over complete set of states (exchange diagram) [17].
The correlation potential ˆΣ is then used to build a new
set of single-electron states, the so-called Brueckner or-
bitals. This set is to be used in the summation in equa-
tions (6), (7) and (8). Here again we use the B-spline
technique to build the basis. The procedure is very sim-
ilar to the construction of the RHF B-spline basis. The
only diﬀerence is that new orbitals are now the eigen-
states of the ˆH0 + ˆΣ Hamiltonian, where ˆΣ is either ˆΣ(2)
or ˆΣ(∞).

Brueckner orbitals which correspond to the lowest va-
lence states are good approximations to the real physical
states. Their quality can be checked by comparing exper-
imental and theoretical energies. Moreover, their quality
can be further improved by rescaling the correlation po-
tential ˆΣ to ﬁt experimental energies exactly. We do this
by replacing the ˆH0 + ˆΣ with the ˆH0 +λ ˆΣ Hamiltonian in
which the rescaling parameter λ is chosen for each partial
wave to ﬁt the energy of the ﬁrst valence state. The val-
ues of λ are λs = 0.8 and λp = 0.85 for ˆΣ(2) and λs = 0.99
and λp = 0.95 for ˆΣ(∞). Note that the values are very
close to unity. This means that even without rescaling
the accuracy is very good and only a small adjustment to
the value of ˆΣ is needed. Note also that since the rescal-
ing procedure aﬀects both energies and wave functions, it
usually leads to improved values of the matrix elements
of external ﬁelds. In fact, this is a semiempirical method
to include omitted higher-order correlation corrections.

Matrix elements of the hfs and electric dipole opera-
tors are found by means of the time-dependent Hartree-
Fock (TDHF) method [16, 22]. This method is equivalent
to the well-known random-phase approximation (RPA).
In the TDHF method, single-electron wave functions are
presented in the form ψ = ψ0 + δψ, where ψ0 is unper-

The best results are achieved when ψn and ψm are
Brueckner orbitals calculated with rescaled correlation
potential ˆΣ.

We use equation (10) for all hfs and electric dipole
matrix elements in (6), (7), and (8) except for the ground
state hfs matrix element in (8) where we use experimental
data.

To check the accuracy of the calculations we perform
calculations of the hfs in the ground state and of the
static scalar polarizability. Polarizability is given by the
expression

(11)

which is very similar to the term (8) for the frequency
shift. The most important diﬀerence is that the energy
denominator is squared in term (8) but not in (11). This
means better convergence with respect to the summa-
tion over complete set of states for term (8) than for
(11). Therefore, if good accuracy is achieved for polariz-
abilities, even better accuracy should be expected for the
term (8) (see also Ref. [9]).

However, the behavior of the other two terms, (6) and
(7), is very diﬀerent and calculation of polarizabilities
tells us little about accuracy for these terms. Therefore,
we also perform detailed calculations of the hfs constants
of the ground state. Inclusion of core polarization (second
term in (10)) involves summation over the complete set of
states similar to what is needed for term (6). Comparing
experimental and theoretical hfs is a good test for the
accuracy for this term.

In addition to term (10), we also include two smaller
contributions to the hfs: structure radiation and the cor-
rection due to the change of the normalization of the
wave function. Our ﬁnal result for the hfs constant is
2278 MHz which is in excellent agreement with the ex-
perimental value 2298 MHz [23]. The result for static po-
larizability is α0 = 399.0 a3
0 which is also in a very good
agreement with experimental value 401.0(6) a3

0 [14].

Table I presents contributions of terms (6), (7) and (8)
into the total frequency shift of the hfs transition for the
ground state of 133Cs calculated in diﬀerent approxima-
tions. Term (8) dominates while term (7) is small but
still important. Results obtained with ˆΣ(2) and ˆΣ(∞)
diﬀer signiﬁcantly (14%). However, after rescaling the
results for both ˆΣ(2) and ˆΣ(∞) come within a fraction of
a per cent of each other. Naturally, rescaling has a larger
eﬀect on results obtained with ˆΣ(2). This means that the
rescaling really imitates the eﬀect of higher-order corre-
lations and should lead to more accurate results.

In summary, we have three ways of estimation of the
accuracy of calculations: (a) calculation of static polariz-
ability (0.5% accuracy); (b) calculation of the hfs (0.9%
accuracy); and (c) comparision of the results obtained in
diﬀerent most accurate approximations (three last lines
of Table I), which diﬀer by about 0.3%. Therefore, we
can say that the accuracy of the calculations is not worse
that 1%. Our ﬁnal result is

We present our ﬁnal result for the frequency shift to-
gether with other theoretical and experimental results in
Table II. Our value is in good agreement with early mea-
surements [2, 4, 7] and ab initio calculations [5, 8] while
recent measurements [10, 11] and semiempirical calcula-
tions [3, 9, 12] give the value which is about 10% smaller.
Less accurate measurements of Bauch and Schr¨oder [6]
cover both cases. We cannot comment on disagreement
between experimental results. However, the source of dis-
agreement between theoretical results seems to be clear.
It comes from the contribution of the continuum spec-
trum to the summation over the complete set of states
in term (6). This term has oﬀ-diagonal hfs matrix el-
ements between the ground state and excited states.
Since the hfs interaction is localized over short distances
(
a0/Z) it emphasizes the contribution of states with

high energies including states in the continuum (since

tions the contribution of states above 7p into term (6) is
10−1Hz/(V/m)2 which is 15% of the total answer.
0.35
In contrast, states above 7p contribute only about
0.05% of the total value of term (8). This is because
the summation goes over the matrix elements of the elec-
tric dipole operator which is large on large distances and
thus suppresses the contribution of high-energy states. It
is not surprising therefore that a semiempirical consider-
ation, involving only discrete spectrum states, gives very
good results for the atomic polarizabilities (see, e.g. [9]).
However, let us stress once more that the calculation of
polarizabilities checks only term (8) and tells us very lit-
tle about the accuracy of other two terms, (6) and (7).

The contribution of the states above 7p is even more
important for term (7). Their contribution is about 30%
of the total value of this term. However, the term itself
is small and its accurate treatment is less important.

In ab initio calculations by Lee et al [5] summation over
complete set of states is reduced to solving of a radial
equation (equations of this type are often called Stern-

This approach does include the contribution of the con-
tinuum spectrum and the result is in very good agreement
with ours (see Table II).

In other ab initio calculations by Pal’chikov et al [8]
summation is done via Green functions. This corresponds

4

to summation over the complete set of states and does
include the continuum spectrum. Again, the result is in
very good agreement with other ab initio calculations ([5]
and the present work).

Recent calculations by Beloy et al [13] applied a mixed
approach, with extensive use of experimental data for
lower cesium states and ab initio summation over higher
states including continuum. The result is in good agree-
ment with fully ab initio calculations.

In contrast, analysis performed in [3, 9, 12] is limited
10−1Hz/(V/m)2
to discrete spectrum. Adding
(which is total tail contribution from all three terms (6),
(7) and (8) found in our calculation) to the results of
Feitchner et al [3] and Micalizio et al [9] brings them to
excellent agreement with ab initio calculations. The same
modiﬁcation of the result by Ulzega et al [12] makes it
a little bit too large but still closer to other results than
without the tail contribution.

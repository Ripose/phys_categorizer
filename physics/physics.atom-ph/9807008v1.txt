Abstract

Active Stark Atomic Spectroscopy (ASAS) method can be used to determine the

electric ﬁeld in the diode of an ion or electron accelerator as a function of position

and time, including the positions of anode and cathode plasma emission surfaces (in

order to obtain the eﬀective accelerating gap). As possible probe beams, we suggest

the use of lithium and sodium atoms. The diagnostic provides a means to measure

diode quantities spectroscopically with excellent spatial resolution.

1 Introduction

High-voltage vacuum diodes of various conﬁgurations have been used widely for gen-

eration of high-power electron and ion beams. In these diodes, electric ﬁelds up to 10
MV/cm, magnetic ﬁelds of several Tesla, and electron and ion current densities of kA/cm2
are produced. Dense, not fully ionized plasmas are generally produced at electrode sur-

faces, either intentionally, as ion or electron sources, or unavoidably, by explosive emission

processes. The resulting dynamics of plasmas and accelerated particles in these diodes

require noninvasive temporally (ns) and spatially (<mm) resolved diagnostics. The single

most criticle quantity for understanding of diode gap processes is probably the electric

ﬁeld, but magnetic ﬁeld, charge particle orbits, and plasma motion incuding charge-

exchange and ionization of neutrals are also of great importance.

In typical high power ion diode conﬁgurations it is highly beneﬁcial to use spectro-
scopic methods for measurements. Y.Maron et al. [1] used a spectroscopic technique for

the ﬁrst direct measurements of the electric ﬁeld distribution in a magnetically-insulated

ion diode. They measured the Stark shift of spectral lines of doubly-ionized aluminum ions

as they crossed a diode gap. This method can be applied only to ion diodes with specially

selected ion composition. Moreover, its sensitivity is rather low due to the characteristics

of electron transitions in heavy ions. In particular, the precision of the measurements in

the above-cited work was 0.4 MV/cm.

Recently, similar experiments were carried out in the ion diode of the PBFA-II ac-
celerator [2]. The Stark shift of the 3p level of lithium in electric ﬁeld up to 10 MV/cm

was determined in these measurements without resonance laser excitation of atoms, but

with self-injection of probe ”charge-exchange” atoms from the partially ionized anode

plasma layer into the diode gap. The probe atoms were produced because of the absence

of a dense plasma layer with zero electic ﬁeld near the anode in these experimets. They

provide the ﬁrst detailed investigation of ion diode acceleration gap physics in the high

power pulses, and the ﬁrst observations of Stark shifts in a 10 MV/cm ﬁeld.

Though the diagnostic methods used for electric ﬁeld measurements in ion diodes

so far have been successful, they are not generally applicable. They cannot be applied,

for example, to a proton-beam accelerator, nor could they be used in a lithium-beam

accelerator with a dense, fully-ionized anode plasma. Furthermore, both of this techniques

can provide measurements only along a line of sight, not at a “point”. In Ref. [3] a method

for measurement of the electric ﬁeld in diodes using probe atoms injected into the gap and

excited by resonant laser radiation was described. In this technique, called Active Stark

Atomic Spectroscopy (ASAS), the Stark splitting of a probe-atom spectral line enables

a calculation of the electric ﬁeld with high time and space resolution. Since the probe

atom density is less than the density of the background gas, this technique would not

disturb the diode. However, high sensitivity is provided by using resonant laser excitation

to saturate the population of the upper level of transitions of interest. Because one can

easily distinguish signal from noise by simply omitting the probe beam or tuning lasers

away from resonance with transitions, a reliable measurement can be made.

In Ref. [4] measurements of the electric ﬁeld in the 6-cm diode gap of the U-1 electron-

beam accelerator by the ASAS technique were brieﬂy described. A lithium atomic probe

beam was injected into the gap before the high-votage was applied. Lithium levels with

a principal quantum number n = 4 were excited through cascade transitions using two

dye-lasers. The bandwidth of the second laser was suﬃciently wide to excite the split

components of interest. Spontaneous emission was recorded with 1 mm spatial resolution

by a monochromator combined with a ﬁber-optic or electron-optic dissector (see [4]).

2

These experiments enabled a direct measurement of the electric ﬁeld strength at the

deﬁnite point as a function of time in the diode during a 6-µs, ∼1 MV voltage pulse.

The electric ﬁeld strength measured in these experiments was 200–300 kV/cm, and the

cathode and anode emission surfaces were located as a function of time.

To apply the ASAS diagnostic method to ion-beam diodes, it is necessary to take

into account the speciﬁc ion diode conditions, including a higher electric ﬁeld strength

and the presence of electron and ion ﬂows in the gap. In this paper, we consider several

experimental arrangements for measurements of the electric ﬁeld by the ASAS technique

with lithium and sodium.

2 Active Stark Atomic Spectroscopy in ion diodes

The selection of an atomic system, which can be used for Stark-splitting measure-

ments, depends upon: (i) the existance of data on Stark-splitting as a function of the

electric ﬁeld, (ii) the availability of suitable lasers for a resonance transition, (iii) rea-

sonable value of splitting in the expected range of the electric ﬁeld, (vi) a low rate of

ﬁeld-ionization of the level. All these requirements are taken into account in the present

paper. Diﬃculties with the calculation of Stark splitting in a strong electric ﬁeld for

atoms other than hydrogen-like, and the requirement of acceptable resonance transitions,

suggest the alkali elements as probe atoms. Another attractive atom is boron, because it

can probably be excited with an intense KrF-laser. In this section we will concentrate on

Li and Na atoms only. We do not discuss in this paper the problem of loss of the probe

atoms by ﬁeld or impact ionization, because this has already been analysed in detail in

Ref. [3]. In general, this is not a serious limitation.

2.1 Stark splitting of lithium and sodium atomic levels

Partial Grotrian diagrams for lithium and sodium atoms are shown in Fig.1, in which

the levels that can be used in the experiments are presented. Motivation for selection of

these levels will be given in the next section. There is not much data on Stark splitting for

atoms in intense electric ﬁelds. Stark splitting for lithium at a ﬁeld up to 500 kV/cm has
been calculated in Ref [3] for levels with principal quantum number n = 4. The 4d and
4f levels of lithium diﬀer only by ∆ =6.8 cm−1. Because already for the electric ﬁeld of
several tens kV/cm splitting becomes more then ∆, this leads to a rather strong splitting

must be solved. Here Φ is the wave function, ˆH0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, E is the
energy of the state, ˆV = e(~r, ~F ) is the perturbation Hamiltonian, e is the electron charge,
~F is the vector of electric ﬁeld strength. When an electron of the 2s shell is excited to
the Rydberg levels, states are formed which are described by a wave function close to

that of the hydrogen atom. The 4p, 4d, 4f levels of lithium are among such states, and

these are strongly split in an electric ﬁeld. Accordingly, we assume that the unpertubed
wave functions of 4pm, 4dm, 4fm levels (which we designate as Φm

electric ﬁeld less then 500 kV/cm, the perturbation intermixes only nearby levels, i.e., the

i . If we choose the direction
of the z axis along the vector ~F , then the perturbation ˆV will not change the projection
of the orbital momentum m and the desired wave function can be given the superscript

The electric ﬁeld mixes and splits the 4p, 4d, 4f levels into eight l, | m |-sublevels:

3, | m | (| m |=0,1,2) (the 3,3-sublevel cannot interact with other sublevels since the orbital

moment projection is conserved by an electric ﬁeld perturbation); 2, | m | (| m |=0,1,2);

and 1, | m |(| m |=0,1). The index l in this context is formal and is connected only with

the origin of a sublevel, as long as an orbital moment is not conserved in the electric

ﬁeld. Stark splitting and split component intensities for the above mentioned transitions

of lithium are tabulated in Ref.[6] for electric ﬁeld up to 500 kV/cm.

In this paper we present more complicated calculations of Stark splitting of sodium

lines for electric ﬁeld up to 5 MV/cm. The high strength causes strong interaction among

the lines with diﬀerent principal quantum number n. Thus, for accurate calculations the

levels with low orbital quantum number l must be involved. However, the wave function

of such levels are quite diﬀerent from hydrogen wave functions because they have strong

interaction with a non-hydrogen-like core. The wave functions needed were obtained by

solving the hydrogen-like Schr¨odinger equation, but using actual dependance of energy
levels of sodium from principal quantum number n as (n + ∆(l))−2, where ∆(l) is a

5

quantum defect for orbital quantum number l. These new wave functions were used in

the calculations of the Stark eﬀect in Na. The method of calculation was the same as

described above for lithium, but many times more levels were used in the calculation
process (levels with n up to 7, and 8s sublevel was taken into account).

The diagram of the splitting of the levels calculated with STARK-I programme

is shown on Fig.2. These calculations were performed for a wide range of levels with

n=2,3,4,5 and up to 5 MV/cm electric ﬁeld strength. The Stark eﬀect of higher-lying

levels is calculated up to 1.5 MV/cm, where these lines disappear [8, 9, 10]. The lower

level shifts are calculated up to 5 MV/cm. The main feature of the splitting seen in Fig.2

is the common shift of all the levels to lower energy. This ﬁgure is a subject of analysis

for selection of working levels for experiments.

3 Selection of the levels

Preliminary consideration of the sodium levels shows us that only a few levels meet
all the requirements listed in Sec.2. The ﬁrst is the 3p level that can be excited from

the ground state level 3s by a dye laser with wavelength 589.0–589.6 nm [7]. The 3p–3s
transition is a strong one, having an Einstein coeﬃcient A = 6.6 · 107 s−1; therefore the
lifetime of the 3p level is 15 ns. The second possibility is the 5s level, which can be
excited from the 3p level by a dye laser with a wavelength in the range 615.4–616.1 nm.

The 5s–3p transition is less strong then the previous one, with an Einstein coeﬃcient
A = 0.6 · 107 s−1 (the lifetime is 150 ns). The 4d level can also be considered but it can
be used for measurements only with an electric ﬁeld strength below 1.5 MV/cm, because

of ﬁeld ionization.

Since the lifetime of the 3p level is very short, this level must be excited during the

accelerator pulse. This is possible with a wide bandwidth laser. Spontaneous ﬂuorescence

from the 3p level then gives the shift of spectral line. The long lifetime of the 5s level

allows excitation before the voltage pulse, avoiding the need for wide laser bandwidth.

The splitting of a ﬂuorescence spectrum of the 3p–3s transition is illustrated in Fig.3.

The splitting is calculated in terms of wavelength shift from the initial wavelength 589.0

nm. The initial splitting is caused by ﬁne structure interaction. Above 2 MV/cm value

of electric ﬁeld strength the splitting becomes big enough for measurement with common

spectroscopy apparatus. The intensities of lines are deﬁned both by the population of

the upper level and by dipole matrix element between upper and lower states. If a high

intensity laser is used the population of the upper level becomes saturated and does not

depend on the electric ﬁeld. The value of population is (g2/(g1 + g2))N = (3/4)N (N

is atomic density). The dipole marix element (or the Einstein coeﬃcient) is almost not
depend on electric ﬁeld strength for this transition. It’s value for π-component is 2.2 · 107

7

Figure 4: Splitting of 5s-3p transition.

s−1, for σ-component is 4.4 · 107 s−1. These calculated values are in a good agreement
with the Einstein coeﬃcient from [7] as all the Einstein coeﬃcients mentioned below.

The level 5s has only one sublevel and the electric ﬁeld shifts it. However, this level

has more possibilities for transition then the 3p. In the high electric ﬁeld all transitions

are possible. In Fig.4, the only one strong line acceptable wavelengthe close to the visible

range is shown. The intensities of lines are deﬁned as in previous case by the population

of the level (g3/(g1 + g2 + g3))N = N/5 and the Einstein coeﬃcient A. The diﬀerence

is that during the electric ﬁeld pulse the population is not supported by the laser and
decreases with time due to ﬂuorescence. The Einstein coeﬃcient of the 5s–3p transition

changes dramatically with the electric ﬁeld rise in contradiction to 3p–3s transition case.

The intensity in Fig.4 is equal to the Einstein coeﬃcient A when F=0.

The 3d level can be used with the same way as 5s. The splitting of the 3d–3p

transition is shown in Fig.5.

Let us consider next a quite diﬀerent possibility from the two previous ones for the

electric ﬁeld mearsurement. If we illuminate the sodium atoms with any laser, it could

occur that levels can be excited in the presence of the high electric ﬁeld during the pulse.

For example, if we use a XeCl laser (308 nm), the sodium atoms which are located where

electric ﬁeld strength is equal to 2.7 or 3 MV/cm can be excited (see Fig.2). An N2

laser (337 nm) will excite the atoms where the electric ﬁeld is 3.4 or 3.7 MV/cm. Any

laser should excite the atoms at some value of electric ﬁeld. If the excited levels have

a lifetime longer than the pulse duration the excited levels could provide spontaneous

8

Figure 5: Splitting of 3d-3p transition.

ﬂuorescence and ﬁeld measurement throughout the pulse. We will call this way of exciting

as ”matching” (electric ﬁeld causes the atom’s excitation energy to match the energy of

the laser photon).

Li atoms can be used also in high electric ﬁeld. However the ﬁrst transition 2p–2s
(λ = 670.8 nm, A = 4 · 107 s−1) seems to be diﬃcult because of the small splitting at ﬁelds
less than 5 MV/cm. The 4s-2p (λ = 497.2 nm, A = 1 · 107 s−1), 3d-2p (λ = 610.4 nm,
A = 7 · 107 s−1), and 3s-2p (λ = 812.6 nm, A = 0.2 · 107 s−1) transitions are preferable.
The ﬁrst level has a long lifetime, and it can be used both with excitation just before the
pulse and in the ”matching” mode. But in extremely high ﬁelds (> 4 MV/cm) the 4s

level will be ionized by the ﬁeld.

4 Electric ﬁeld measurement in an ion diode gap

There are a number of ways of observing the ASAS ﬂuorescence. Figure 6 shows a
way to observe lines of equal electric ﬁeld strength | ~F |. A thin rectangular (slab) beam of
thermal sodium atoms is introduced into the ion gap. The wide dimension of the slab is

parallel to the axis so that the atoms stretch between anode and cathode. The atoms are

excited by slab laser beams that have a small pitch angle to the atomic beam in a plane

parallel to the anode so that a wide area of atoms will be excited and emit spontaneous

ﬂuorescence. An optical system with a narrow band ﬁlter gathers the ﬂuorescence and

gives an image of the ﬂuorescing area on a frame camera. The ﬁlter selects a narrow

9

Figure 6: Scheme for observation of equal | ~F | lines.

bandwidth (1÷10 nm) of the light which corresponds to a deﬁnite electric ﬁeld strength.
The resulting image will show light along lines of equal | ~F |.

A similar concept can be realized with ”matching” method. Instead of using a ﬁlter

the ”matching” method of excitation would used. A short-pulse laser beam irradiates the

atomic slab. Atoms are excited only in the regions with deﬁnite electric ﬁeld strengths,

where the split components of the spectrum are resonant with the laser wavelegth. The
spectral apparatus is not needed. The resulting image shows the lines of constant | ~F |.
The time gate of the frame camera can be wide because the moment of measurement is

deﬁned by the laser pulse. This method appears to be more sensitive than the ﬁrst.

If the long pulse duration laser will be used for excitation of the levels with a short

life time in the ”matching” mode, it is possible to get the movies: a set of pictures with
lines of deﬁnite | ~F | in diﬀerent moments of time.

A method using a monochromator is illustrated by Fig.7a. A thin coloumn of excited

atoms is imaged by a lens on the input slit of the monochromator so that the distance

along the slit images the distance between anode and cathode. The output of the frame

camera gives a two-dimensional picture: the horizontal axis is the distance between anode

and cathode, and the vertical axis is wavelength. The electric ﬁeld variation in the gap

can be obtained from this picture. In addition the eﬀect of line disappearance provides a

further check on the electric ﬁeld measurement.

Replacement of the frame camera by a streak camera provides the possibility to see

the dependance of a local electric ﬁeld strength in a time (Fig.7b). The eﬀect of ﬁeld

ionization can also be observed.

5 Summary

The choice of concrete scheme of realization of ASAS technique depends on the device

where the diagnostics whould be applied and the goals of the experiment. But it must

be pointed out that the most simple way for getting the result is the ”matching” mode

of ASAS. It is needed only one laser and unit for registration. The spectral apparatus is

not needed!

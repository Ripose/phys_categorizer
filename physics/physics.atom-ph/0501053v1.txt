We have investigated the photoassociation (PA) spectra of ultracold 88Sr atoms near the 5s2 1S0 +
5s5p 1P1 atomic asymptote. The intensity modulation of the PA lines was used to reconstruct the
ground-state scattering wave function, whose nodal point inferred the s-wave scattering length of
a = 1.1(2) nm. The observed PA resonances also determined a precise lifetime of the 1P1 state to
be 5.263(4) ns.

PACS numbers: 34.50.Rk, 32.70.Cs, 32.80.Pj, 34.10.+x

The s-wave scattering length a is one of the funda-
mental parameters that dominate ultracold collisions. Its
sign and magnitude determine the rate and eﬃciency of
the evaporative cooling [1]. The stability and dynam-
ics of the Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [2, 3, 4, 5]
are subjected to a through the mean ﬁeld energy term
Its tunability via a
in Gross-Pitaevskii equation [4].
Feshbach resonance [6] is utilized to improve the eﬃ-
ciency of evaporative cooling process [7], leading to the
formation of ultracold molecules as well as molecular
BECs [8, 9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, the performance of
the state-of-the-art atomic fountain clocks depends on
the cold collision shifts characterized by the scattering
length [12].

Owing to the high sensitivity of the scattering lengths
on the actual potential surfaces, it is not easy for con-
ventional ab initio calculations to deduce a with suﬃ-
cient accuracy. The experimental approaches, therefore,
are indispensable for its determination. One of the most
versatile experimental techniques is the photoassociation
(PA) spectroscopy [13]. Through the intensity modula-
tion of the PA lines, one can reconstruct the ground-state
scattering wave function, especially its last node, which
is directly connected to the scattering length [14, 15, 16].
Since the ﬁrst demonstration of the technique in laser-
cooled Na [17] and Rb [18] atoms, there have been exten-
sive theoretical as well as experimental studies in alkali-
metal systems [19]. However, the interpretation of these
PA lines is rather delicate because the hyperﬁne struc-
ture in their ground as well as excited states gives rise to
complicated molecular potentials often referred to as hy-
perﬁne spaghetti [20]. In contrast, alkaline-earth system
oﬀers the simplest energy structures, i.e., the 1S0 ground
state and the 1P1 excited state, which allows a straightfor-
ward interpretation of the PA spectra. Recently PA line
proﬁle was obtained for Ca, which was used for determin-
ing the possible range of the scattering length [21]. The
predissociation process was revealed through the broad-
ening of the PA line proﬁles in Yb atoms [22].

In this Letter we report on the ﬁrst determination of
the s-wave scattering length for the 5s2 1S0 state of 88Sr
atoms by reconstructing the scattering wave function
through photoassociation spectroscopy. The PA spec-
tra were investigated for detunings down to ∆ =
600
GHz below the 5s2 1S0 + 5s5p 1P1 atomic asymptote.

Thanks to the simple electronic structure of alkaline-
earth atoms, the observed intensity modulation of the
PA lines straightforwardly inferred the squared scat-
tering wave function for the interatomic separation of
3.2
11 nm. The node of the scattering wave function
was found at r0 = 3.70(7) nm, which determined the
scattering length to be a = 1.1(2) nm by correcting the
van der Waals interaction. The PA resonances were also
used to derive the most precise lifetime of 5.263(4) ns yet
reported for the 5s5p 1P1 state.

We consider an atom pair in the 1S0 ground state with
relatively large interatomic distance r, where the van der
Waals interaction Vg(r) does not play a decisive role,
0. By shining a PA laser with frequency νL,
Vg(r)
ν0 < 0) in respect
which is negatively detuned (∆ = νL −
1P1 atomic transition, the atom pair
to the relevant 1S0 −
is excited to the 1Σ+
u molecular state (Fig. 1) bound by
the resonant dipole-dipole interaction. The molecular po-
tential is given by

which is eﬀective for the region where the retardation ef-
fects [23] are negligible, i.e., r < λ0. Here D = hν0 is the
energy of the 1S0 + 1P1 atomic asymptote, and ~ = 2πh is
Planck’s constant. The coupling constant C3 for the 1Σ+
u
molecular state is expressed in terms of the reduced wave-
length λ0 = λ0/2π of the corresponding atomic transition
and the radiative lifetime τ0 of the 1P1 state. Therefore,
for the region of interest in the following discussion, the

The PA process is observed by the atom losses: In the
dissociation of the molecular states, the atom pair will
acquire enough kinetic energy from the molecular poten-
tial through radiative decay or state changing processes
[24] to be ejected from a shallow trapping potential.

The PA spectroscopy was done for ultracold Sr atoms
trapped in a one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice [25].
Thermal atomic beam of Sr was decelerated and trapped
1P1
in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) using the 1S0 −
transition at λ0 = 461 nm. Atoms were then further

cooled down to a few µK in the MOT operated on the
3P1 intercombination transition at λ = 689 nm with
1S0 −
a linewidth of 7.5 kHz. In this cooling stage, a standing-
wave trap laser was introduced to conﬁne atoms into the
1D optical lattice. The trap laser with a wavelength of
λL ≈
810 nm and its power of 250 mW was focused to
the e−1 beam radius of 25 µm, which gave radial and ax-
ial trap frequencies of 350 Hz and 40 kHz, respectively.
With this trapping laser parameters, the excited-state
10−9 even for the most strongly cou-
fraction was
pled 1P1 state; therefore, in the following discussion, we
could neglect the excited atom fraction. In addition, the
150 kHz as well as the
induced light shift of δU/h
residual Doppler shift of
60 kHz is much smaller than
32 MHz or the
the atomic transition linewidth γa/2π
molecular linewidth of 2γa. Typical number of atoms N0
loaded into the optical lattice was 105, corresponding to
1012 cm−3. This high atomic
a peak density of n0 ≈
density oﬀered us a clear PA signal, since the two-body
atom loss rate βn0 could be made larger than the linear
loss rate Γ. Furthermore the ultracold temperature of
atoms suppresses the higher order partial waves and a
single rotational level (J = 0) is allowed.

The PA laser at λ0 = 461 nm was generated by fre-
quency doubling of a frequency-stabilized titanium sap-
phire laser (Coherent, MBR110), by a 7-mm long waveg-
uide periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal.
The PA beam with the e−1 beam radius of 120 µm was
superimposed on the lattice beam. Its intensity IPA was
typically 10 W/cm2, which is much larger than the sat-
uration intensity Isat = 42 mW/cm2 of the associated

atomic transition. Such a rather intense PA laser was
needed to excite deeply bound vibrational levels with a
binding energy of h∆, since the Franck-Condon factor
−1/2 as discussed later. Because of this
decreases as

∆ dependence of the PA rate (
βn0), we set duration
τPA of the PA laser in the range of 5 to 600 ms so as
to obtain typical atom losses of 50% during a single fre-
quency scan. The PA spectrum was obtained by observ-
ing the number of remaining atoms by the laser induced
1P1 cyclic transition. The PA
ﬂuorescence on the 1S0 −
laser frequency was monitored by a wavemeter (Burleigh,
WA-1500), whose output signal was calibrated using the
absorption spectrum of Te2 [26]. One cycle of the mea-
surement took 1 s, and the sweep rate of the PA laser
frequency was 40 MHz/s, which was continuously swept
over 48 GHz in a single scan.

ﬂuctuation noise of
the vibrational lines reappeared at ∆
400 GHz and
the PA signal κ increased with further detuning. We at-
tributed this disappearance of the PA signal to the node
of the ground-state wave function. We note that observed
linewidths of the PA spectra of a few hundred MHz were
explained in terms of the power broadening: For a vibra-
tional line at ∆ =
107 GHz, for example, by reducing
the PA laser intensity down to 40 mW/cm2, we reached
the minimum linewidth of 84
12 MHz, which is roughly
a molecular linewidth of 2γa. Other line broadening ef-
fects such as predissociation [22] was not observed in our
scanning range.

of the ﬁt, which conﬁrms the validity of Eq. (2) that
neglected the higher order dispersion terms such as C6
and C8. The X0 obtained by the ﬁtting determined the
potential coeﬃcient C3 = 18.360
0.013 (atomic unit),
which inferred the atomic radiative lifetime of the 1P1
state to be τ0 = 5.263
0.004 ns or the atomic linewidth
0.02 MHz. This value is one order of
of γa/2π = 30.24
magnitude improvement in precision compared with the
previous measurement [28]. We note that this PA spec-
troscopy was carried out in the optical trap. However,
because of the very small excited-state fraction, as men-
tioned previously, the light shift potential does not aﬀect
the above result with this precision.

The intensity modulation of the PA signal contains
useful information on the amplitude of the ground-state
scattering wave function ug(r), which is related to the
radial wave function R(r) = ug(r)/r and obeys the 1D
Schr¨odinger equation. The PA loss rate can be associated
with the free-bound Franck-Condon (FC) factor F (∆).
Following the reﬂection approximation [29], the FC fac-
tor is calculated by the squared ground-state scattering
wave function ug(r) at the Condon radius rC ,

structed wave function
ties using Eq. (7). In this way, the disappearance of the
PA lines is related to the nodal point of the scattering
wave function. We note that our previous measurements
on the rethermalization time for ultracold 88Sr atoms [30]
inferred that the scattering length is not larger than 5
nm, or the last node to be r0 < 5 nm. Therefore we
presume that the observed node is the last one. Assum-

information on the nodal point of the ground-state wave
function, which led to the ﬁrst determination of the s-
wave scattering length a = +1.1
0.2 nm. Although
the magnitude is not very large, this positive scattering
length suggests that the evaporative cooling of Sr toward
BEC would be feasible, starting from a very high phase-
space density of ρ
0.1 achieved by Doppler cooling on
the narrow transition [35]. A scaling-law estimation sug-
gests that the evaporative cooling by lowering the con-
ﬁning potential from 10 µK to 1 µK in a few seconds
will result in a phase-space density of unity, assuming
the initial mean trap oscillation frequency of 1 kHz [36].

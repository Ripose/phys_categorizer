Abstract. We employ the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian for time-independent
calculations of multi-photon ionization of atoms with one and two electrons. As
compared to the electromagnetic interaction in the length and velocity gauges, the
presently employed Kramers-Henneberger gauge has an advantage of the dipole matrix
elements for the free-free electron transitions being ﬁnite and well-deﬁned quantities.
This circumstance simpliﬁes considerably the computations and allows to obtain
accurate results for the two-photon ionization of realistic atomic systems.

1. Introduction

Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement of high-power short-pulse laser

techniques which make it possible to observe many striking phenomena such as

multi-photon ionization (MPI) and above-threshold ionization (ATI). This progress

in experimental techniques has been accompanied by equally rapid development of

theoretical methods needed to describe adequately phenomena occurring in strong laser

ﬁelds. Representative reviews giving detailed account of these theoretical advances can

be found in Protopapas et al (1997), Lambropoulos et al (1998), Chu & Telnov (2004)

and Posthumus (2004).

It is well-known that interaction of an atom and the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld

can be described in various ways corresponding to diﬀerent choices of the gauge.

In

single-photon ionization calculations, it is the length and velocity gauges that are used

most commonly. This choice is quite natural since in the length and velocity gauges the

dipole matrix elements assume a very simple form. If, however, one wishes to compute

probabilities of various multi-photon processes, a diﬃculty immediately arises. The

dipole matrix elements corresponding to the free-free electron transitions are divergent.

There are various ways to circumvent this diﬃculty. For one-electron systems

this problem can be easily avoided since analytical expressions for the Coulomb Green

function are known. This fact has been exploited in many papers (Klarsfeld 1969,

Rapoport et al 1969, Arnous et al 1973, Teague & Lambropoulos 1976, Klarsfeld &

Maquet 1979, Karule 1971, Karule 1985, Karule & Moine 2003). Alternatively, one

may avoid the divergency problems by reducing summations and integrations over

intermediate electron states to solution of nonhomogeneous diﬀerential equations (Zernik

& Klopfenstein 1965, Chan & Tang 1969, Jayadevan & Thayyullathil 2001).

For systems with more than one electron, where these techniques cannot be

implemented, other methods have been developed. The states belonging to the

continuous spectrum of the system can be represented by means of a suitable set

of the square integrable (L2) functions (Tang & Bachau 1993, Venuti et al 1996).

The system is quantized in a box of suﬃciently large dimensions which gives a

Kramers-Henneberger calculations of multi-photon ionization

discretized representation of the continuous spectrum. This approach, supplemented

by the B-splines technique, allowed to obtain a set of accurate MPI and ATI

cross-sections for many-electron systems such as He (Venuti et al 1996, Saenz &

Lambropoulos 1999, Nikolopoulos & Lambropoulos 2001) and Be (Tang & Bachau 1993).

Another technique which was applied successfully to study MPI in many-electron

systems uses a regularization procedure for the free-free matrix-elements (Mercouris

& Nicolaides 1989, Nicolaides & Mercouris 1989, Korol 1997).

In the present paper we describe an alternative method allowing to compute

amplitudes of the MPI and ATI processes in many-electron systems in a more direct way.

The proposed method is based on the so-called Kramers-Henneberger (KH) form of the

interaction Hamiltonian (Kramers 1956, Henneberger 1968). The KH representation

of the system “atom plus electromagnetic ﬁeld” is often used when one studies a

temporal evolution of atomic systems subjected to a pulse of EM radiation (Reed &

Burnett 1991, Vivirito & Knight 1995). The KH representation also enables simple

asymptotic boundary conditions used in the external region of the R-matrix Floquet

theory (Burke et al 1991).

In the present paper we shall be interested in another aspect of the KH

representation, namely the advantages

its use may oﬀer

in the perturbative

computations of MPI rates. To our knowledge, the KH description of the EM radiation

interaction with atoms has not been used in this context. As we shall see, in the

perturbative calculations the KH representation oﬀers one important advantage.

In

contrast to the length and velocity gauges,

in the KH formulation all the dipole

matrix elements are ﬁnite and well-deﬁned. For the laser ﬁelds of not very large

intensities (below 1013 Wcm−2) the perturbation theory (PT) provides quite an adequate

description of the MPI process and allows to achieve numerically accurate results with

much less computational labor. We shall consider below two-photon ionization processes

in the hydrogen and helium atoms. The highly accurate perturbative results available in

the literature allow us to evaluate directly the accuracy of the method. We also discuss

some subtle numerical aspects of application of the KH Hamiltonian in perturbative

Kramers-Henneberger calculations of multi-photon ionization

The use of the KH Hamiltonian in time-independent MPI calcualtions is not

restricted to preturbative regime.

In our recent paper (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005) we

demonstrated utility of this method in a non-perturbative calculation of the MPI rates

In the following sections, we brieﬂy recall main theoretical aspects of the KH

representation, describe the computation of the dipole matrix elements and apply the

technique to two-photon ionization of atomic hydrogen and helium.

2. Theory

A starting point for the description of the interaction of an atom and a monochromatic

EM ﬁeld is the minimal coupling Hamiltonian:

ˆH = ˆHatom + ˆHint .

atomic electrons.

In the following we shall assume that the dipole approximation is

valid so that the vector potential does not depend on atomic coordinates. Performing a

suitable canonical transformation of Equation (3), one can obtain various forms of the

interaction Hamiltonian. The KH Hamilton is obtained by the canonical transformation

Expressed in quantum-mechanical terms (as far as description of the EM ﬁeld

is concerned),

this transformation is also known as the Pauli-Fierz canonical

transformation (Pauli & Fierz 1938). We shall not distinguish between these two versions

of the transformation as the ﬁnal results are identical.

Under the transformation (4) the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian (2) becomes:

where ˆHatom retains the same form as the Hamiltonian (2) while the interaction

(6)

We shall be interested in the case of a linearly polarized monochromatic EM ﬁeld. In

this case ˆα = ˆF /ω2 where ˆF is the operator of the electric ﬁeld intensity, ω is the photon

energy. §. If ˆα can be considered as a small quantity, the leading term of expansion

of (6) reproduces the well-known Zr/r3 form of the interaction Hamiltonian in the

acceleration gauge. This form is often used in the ﬁrst-order perturbation calculations.

We, however, are interested in higher order eﬀects and must generally retain complete

form of the Hamiltonian (6).

To build the perturbation theory expansion, treating operator (6) as a perturbation,

we need a formula for the matrix elements of this operator sandwiched between the

states describing the noninteracting atom and the EM ﬁeld. It is convenient for our

purposes to use the notation |a, mi for these states where a stands for a set of quantum

numbers describing the atom and m denotes a number of laser photons in a given mode.

Such a formula can be obtained from the known matrix elements of the quantized

vector potential operator (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005). A simpler derivation, relying on

the correspondence between the quantum and classical description of the EM ﬁeld, is

given in the Appendix I.

Here F is already a classical vector and not an operator. Its magnitude is related to

the number of photons via the ﬂux conservation relation F 2/8π = nω, and it is directed

along the polarization vector of the incoming photons. In the following, we shall take

this direction as the z-axis.

Equation (9) is written for the case when the atomic subsystem contains one electron

(hydrogen). Generalization for the case of many-electron systems is a simple exercise in

angular momentum algebra.

When performing perturbation calculations, we are usually interested in keeping

track of ﬁeld dependencies of the matrix elements. Suppose we study a process for

which, in the leading order, the amplitude is proportional to k-th power of electric

ﬁeld strength M ∝ F k, with some integer k. Then we would like to retain in the

perturbation theory expressions only the terms which give rise to such dependence in

the limit of small F . If the length or velocity forms for the atom-EM ﬁeld interaction

is used, such a count of powers of F is trivial, following from the well-known selection

rules for the matrix elements. In the KH representation, there are no exact selection

rules. Nevertheless, the count of powers of the electric ﬁeld strength is still possible.

Consider, for example, the case of a two-photon ionization of a one-electron atom, which

is the second-order process. Suppose, we are interested in the ionization from the state

a with a given orbital momentum l. Then it is easy to see from Equation (8) that the

following asymptotics holds for F → 0:

hal m| ˆH KH

int |bl m ± 2i ∝ F 2

,

hal m| ˆH KH

int |bl ± 1 m ± 1i ∝ F .

(10)

Here a and b stand for the set of all atomic quantum numbers except the angular

momentum, the integer m refers to a total number of laser photons. It is easy to see

from Equation (8) that the coeﬃcient of proportionality in the second matrix element

of (10) is just a matrix element of the operator Zr/r3 which is commonly used in the

ﬁrst order calculations in the acceleration gauge.

Thus, the leading terms of the amplitude of the two-photon ionization can be

written as:

M(al m → bl m − 2) = hal m| ˆH KH

int |bl m − 2i

hal m| ˆH KH

int |cl′ m − 1ihcl′ m − 1| ˆH KH

Here the symbol

indicates the sum over the discrete spectrum and integration over

int .

Once the amplitudes (11) – (13) are computed, the generalized partial cross-section

of the two-photon ionization from the initial state a, l to a ﬁnal channel b, l′ is given by

(c.f. Tang & Bachau (1993))

Here α, a0, τ0 are the ﬁne structure constant, the atomic unit length in cm and the

atomic unit time in seconds. F is the EM ﬁeld strength and ω is the photon energy,

both expressed in the atomic units. The one-electron continuum wave functions used

to calculate the ionization amplitudes are normalized on the momentum scale. The

generalized cross-section (14) is related to the ionization rate

(15)

where λ is wavelength (in nm) and Ryd = 109677 cm−1 is the Rydberg constant (Karule

& Moine 2003).

It has to be noted that the KH transformation modiﬁes, in general, the atomic states

after the ﬁeld is switched oﬀ at a suﬃciently large time (Vivirito & Knight 1995, Reed &

Burnett 1991). However, it is shown in Appendix II that this does not aﬀect the cross-

sections or ionization rates and can only be noticed in the ﬁne details of the temporal

evolution of the system

3. Numerical computations

Certain amount of care has to be exercised when the amplitudes (11) – (13) are computed

numerically. Consider matrix elements in the sums over intermediate states in these

expressions. Separating radial and angular variables with the help of equations (7),

(8), and taking the form Zr/r3 for the interaction Hamiltonian we obtain integrals of

the sort I =

REl(r)Rkl′(r) dr. Here R’s are radial electron wave functions behaving

as rl near the origin r = 0. Function REl describes either an initial or ﬁnal state of

R

the process, Rkl′ is the radial wave function of the intermediate state belonging to the

continuous spectrum which, for large momenta, behaves as Rkl′(r) ∝ sin(kr + δ)/r.

The k-dependence of the integral is crucially dependent on the orbital momentum l.

If l > 0 the integral I can be approximated for large k as

REl(r) sin(kr + δ)/r (we

omit unimportant normalization factors). Consider the function P (r) = REl/r. If l > 0,
∞

|P (r)|dr is ﬁnite, hence the Riemann-Lebesgues lemma is applicable and the integral I

R
will decay for k → ∞. If l = 0, the replacement of the Rkl′ by its asymptotic expression

R

is not legitimate (we would obtain a divergent integral). More careful study shows that if

l = 0 than I → const when k → ∞. The integrals over momenta of intermediate states

in the formulas (11) – (13) still converge in this case due to the energy denominator but

much more slowly than in the case of l > 0. This means that to achieve a good numerical

accuracy for the amplitudes with l = 0, one must take into account an asymptotic tail

Kramers-Henneberger calculations of multi-photon ionization

9

of the integrand for k → ∞.

In practice, this does not pose serious diﬃculties. One has only to determine (either

analytically or numerically) the constant in the expression I → const for k large enough

so that this asymptotic law holds well, and then add the corresponding contribution to

the integrals in formulas (11) – (13). For l > 0 one need not worry about the asymptotic

tails of the integrand as integrals I decay quite fast with k.

For the presently considered targets (H and He), the initial state has an S orbital

character leading to the two ﬁnal channels S and D which correspond to amplitudes

(11) and (12). As explained above, we may retain in these amplitudes only the P

intermediate states. Both the discrete and continuous intermediate states were taken

into account. The continuous spectrum integration follows closely prescriptions given in

Bray (1994) and Ivanov & Kheifets (2005). The interval of momenta (0, qmax) is divided

into several subintervals. For the photon energies above the ionization threshold, a

pole is present in the momentum integral. To carry out the integration around the

pole accurately, the ﬁrst two subintervals are chosen to be (0, kpole) and (kpole, 2kpole)

with a typical number of 20 momentum points in each subinterval. Then the delta-

function singularity is isolated and the remaining principle value integral is evaluated

by a modiﬁed Gaussian rule (Bray 1994). The remaining part of the momentum integral

is divided as follows: (2kpole, 4) (20 integration points), (4, 10) (20 points) and (10, qmax)

(20 points). These intervals are pole-free and the integration is performed by using a

Gauss quadrature rule. The fairly large value of qmax is chosen to take care of a slow

decay of the integrand in the S-channel. The asymptotic tail (qmax, ∞) is calculated

analytically.

It is worth to be noted that the ﬁrst order matrix elements in the amplitudes (11),

(12) are roughly of the same magnitude as the second order terms and, sometime, of

the opposite sign. So their inclusion is essential.

Once the amplitudes are computed the partial cross-sections and rates can be

determined via Eqs. (14), (15). Total cross-sections and rates corresponding to linear

and circular polarization of the EM ﬁeld can then be determined. If inital state of atomic

Kramers-Henneberger calculations of multi-photon ionization

system is an S-state, than: Γl(ns) = Γ(ns → ks) + Γ(ns → kd) (linear polarization)

and Γc(ns) =

Γ(ns → kd) (circular polarization) (Jayadevan & Thayyullathil 2001).

All calculations reported below were performed for the EM ﬁeld strength of

F = 0.03 a.u. This ﬁeld strength is small enough, so that determination of the cross

sections via Eq.(14) for small but ﬁnite F will be, as we shall see, quite accurate.

4. Results

4.1. Hydrogen

In the case of hydrogen, all the one-electron wave functions are know analytically. These

allowed us to include 15 discrete intermediate P states and carry out integration up to

qmax = 70 a.u. in the second-order amplitudes.

In Table 1, we present the rates of the two-photon ionization of the ground state

hydrogen atom with the linear and circular polarized light and compare them with the

latest literature values (Jayadevan & Thayyullathil 2001, Karule & Moine 2003). The

three sets of data are virtually identical for all the photon energies considered. The

cited literature values have been obtained analytically which is possible for hydrogen.

They can be, therefore, considered as ”exact”. The comparison in the Table indicates

that the use of the KH Hamiltonian allowed us to achieve comparable level of accuracy

with little eﬀort.

4.2. Helium

We consider now two-photon ionization from the ground state of helium. Due to possible

two-electron excitations, complete treatment of this problem is much more complicated

than for hydrogen. However, for the photon energies below the threshold of the N = 2

excitations, we can use a frozen core approximation and restrict ourselves with only one

active electron. In this approximation, the problem is eﬀectively reduced to a hydrogen-

like calculation with numerical Hartree-Fock wave functions.

We describe the helium atom as follows. For the ground state we use the self-

consistent Hartree-Fock approximation (Chernysheva et al 1976). The ground state is

thus represented as a product of the two 1s orbitals. For the excited states, both discrete

and continuous, we use the frozen core Hartree-Fock approximation (Chernysheva

et al 1979). These states are thus represented as properly symmetrized products of

the 1s core orbital and an orbital describing excited electron either in the bound state

or the continuum.

Because of this frozen-core approximation, the calculation for helium proceeds in

almost exactly the same way as for hydrogen. The only diﬀerence is that due to the

equivalence of the 1s2 electrons an additional factor of 2 arises in the formula for the

cross-section. As for hydrogen, we may retain only P states in the sums over the

intermediate states. We have retained 7 P -states corresponding to the excitations 1snp

with n = 2−8. Integration over the continuous spectrum was performed as for hydrogen

except for the value of qmax = 30 a.u. All we said above concerning importance of the

correct account of the asymptotic tail in the momentum integral for the S-wave, applies

for the case of helium as well.

Our results are presented in the Figure in comparison with other calculations (Saenz

& Lambropoulos 1999, Nikolopoulos & Lambropoulos 2001) which use a considerably

more accurate representation of the helium atom. Despite a rather crude character

of the frozen-core approximation, in the region of the photon energies considered we

achieve quite a satisfactory agreement with the literature values. We could not, of

course, extend our calculation into the region of larger photon energies since there the

Lambropoulos 1999) and NL01 (Nikolopoulos & Lambropoulos 2001)

We have shown that the KH description of the atom-EM radiation interaction can be

used eﬃciently in calculations of MPI and ATI processes in realistic atomic systems.

The fact that the dipole matrix elements between continuous electron states are ﬁnite

and well-deﬁned quantities makes the calculation relatively simple, both numerically

and conceptually.

For hydrogen, the present results agree completely with those obtained in Jayadevan

& Thayyullathil (2001) and Karule & Moine (2003). As the latter results are analytical

and can therefore be considered as virtually exact, we may be conﬁdent that the present

approach allows to achieve quite a high accuracy. Our method can also be applied to

the systems with more that one electron, as the comparison with the data for the

two-photon ionization of helium shows. Despite the fact that we used rather a crude

description of the ﬁeld-free helium atom (we omitted the core-excitation eﬀects), we

obtained good quantitative agreement with the results of other authors who employed

a more elaborate representation for the helium atom. As was indicated above, the

accuracy of our description of MPI of helium can be further improved without any

problems of conceptual character. All we have to do is to “thaw” the core and to

Kramers-Henneberger calculations of multi-photon ionization

13

allow the two-electron excitations. This can be done, for example, with the use of the

convergent close-coupling (CCC) method (Bray 1994) which is known to provide good

description of a complete set of two-electron states, both discrete and continuous. Such

calculation will be reported elsewhere.

6. Appendix I

We give below a derivation of Equation (7) for the matrix elements of the KH interaction

Hamiltonian based on the well-known correspondence between the classical Floquet and

the quantum-mechanical descriptions of the atom-EM ﬁeld interaction (Shirley 1965).

In the classical picture, the KH Hamiltonian has the form (6) with α = F cos ωt/ω2

where F is a classical amplitude of the EM ﬁeld. With this expression being a periodic

function of time, the Shcr¨odinger equation has a set of solutions (the Floquet anzats)

which allows the following Floquet-Fourier expansion:

In the quantum-mechanical description, the coeﬃcients with the amplitudes um on the
r.h.s of Equation (19) are nothing but the matrix elements hn| ˆH KH

the states with n and m photons (Shirley 1965). This correspondence holds if we neglect

all spontaneous processes and retain only laser photons. Since in Eq.(19) summation

index k ≥ 0, for given n,m, n 6= m, the two terms on the r.h.s of this equation can

we obtained this formula directly using quantized form of the electric ﬁeld operator.

7. Appendix II

A comment has to be made on the applicability in the present case of the Fermi golden

rule which is used to derive Eq.(14). Below, all the discussion uses only classical terms

for the description of the EM ﬁeld which leads to the same results as the full quantum-

mechanical treatment but is somewhat simpler.

Physically, transformation to the KH frame is equivalent to transformation to the

non-inertial frame oscillating with the electron. Let us suppose that an initially ﬁeld-

free atom is in some state Ψ0. At the moment t = 0 the interaction of the atom and

EM ﬁeld is switched on and it is switched oﬀ at the moment t = t1 with some t1 large

enough so that all the transient processes are negligible. With the help of formulas (11) –

(13) we can obtain (for suﬃciently large t1) perturbative solution of the time-dependent

Schr¨odinger equation in the KH-frame. As a result, we obtain at the moment t1 a vector

in the KH frame:

ΨKH(t1) = U KH(0, t1)Ψ0,

(20)

where U KH(0, t1) is the evolution operator which we constructed in the KH frame to a

given order of the perturbation theory.

To determine rates of various processes, we must now ﬁnd overlaps of the vector thus

obtained with various states of the ﬁeld-free atom. The latter, however, are generally

diﬀerent from the eigenstates of H0, the original ﬁeld-free atomic Hamiltonian. As

formula (4) shows, they are connected to the eigenstates of H0 by means of a unitary
transformation generated by the operator ˆT in Eq. (4). The fact that ﬁnal states are

generally altered by this operator may play an important role in calculations of time-

evolution of an atomic system under the action of an impulse of EM radiation (Vivirito

& Knight 1995, Reed & Burnett 1991).

The problem we are considering here diﬀers from the problems of determining the

Kramers-Henneberger calculations of multi-photon ionization

15

time-evolution under the action of an impulse of EM radiation in one important aspect.

We are at liberty to switch oﬀ interaction at any time (provided it is large enough).

Operator ˆT in Eq.(4) contains two terms. The one proportional to the square of the

vector potential is unimportant (it is a pure phase factor in the dipole approximation

which we use). It is the term linear in A that is responsible for the alteration of the

ﬁnal states. We may use, however, periodicity of the vector potential and choose the

moment t1 so that this term disappears. The ﬁnal states then remain unaltered and the

validity of the Fermi golden rule is restored.

Loading a vapor cell magneto-optic trap using light-induced atom desorption

(July 14, 2000)

Low intensity white light was used to increase the loading rate of 87Rb atoms into a vapor cell
magneto-optic trap by inducing non-thermal desorption of Rb atoms from the stainless steel walls
of the vapor cell. An increased Rb partial pressure reached a new equilibrium value in less than 10
seconds after switching on the broadband light source. After the source was turned oﬀ, the partial
pressure returned to its previous value in 1/e times as short as 10 seconds.

I. INTRODUCTION

The evaporative cooling techniques used to achieve
Bose-Einstein condensation in atomic gases [1–4] rely on
loading large numbers of atoms into magnetic traps with
long trap lifetimes. The approach originally taken by An-
derson et al. [1] was to load Rb atoms into a vapor cell
[5] magneto-optic trap (MOT) [6] and to subsequently
transfer atoms into a magnetic trap located in the same
cell. Large numbers of atoms and long lifetimes were
achieved by optimizing the Rb partial pressure and by
working with long MOT loading times.

We have found a simple way to improve such a setup
by modulating the vapor pressure such that it is high for
initial trap loading and then low again in order to achieve
long lifetimes in a magnetic trap. The technique requires
the use of a white light source (WLS) with radiation in-
cident upon the inner walls of the vapor cell. When such
a light source is turned on, Rb atoms that coat the inner
walls of the stainless steel vacuum chamber are quickly
desorbed and the Rb vapor pressure suddenly increases.
The vapor pressure soon returns to equilibrium after the
WLS is turned oﬀ. This enables loading large numbers of
atoms into the MOT in a relatively short amount of time,
while preserving the low pressures required for long mag-
netic trap lifetimes. The WLS method that we describe
here is a possible alternative to the double-chamber tech-
niques [7] and Zeeman slowing techniques [2,3] currently
used to capture atoms before evaporatively cooling in a
magnetic trap. In our experiments, the WLS method is
used in the manner described here for the achievement
of BEC in a vapor cell, where the WLS frees us from en-
vironmentally induced variations in vapor pressure; for
example, regardless of chamber temperature, we can load
large numbers of atoms into our MOT and achieve BEC
[8].

Light-induced atom desorption (LIAD) has previously
been used to obtain optically thick Na and Rb vapors in
cells made of glass, pyrex, and sapphire [9,10]. In most of
these experiments, the inner walls of the vapor cells were
coated with paraﬃn or silane in order to enhance the

1

LIAD eﬃciency by reducing the alkali atom adsorption
energy [11]. In our work, an optically thick vapor was not
required. Since we did not need desorption rates char-
acteristic of coated cells, we could desorb atoms directly
from stainless steel.

II. BACKGROUND

We ﬁrst review the basic mechanisms involved in the
operation of a vapor cell MOT,
lucidly described in
Ref. [5], in order to understand the gains available with
the LIAD method.
In a vapor cell MOT, atoms are
loaded into the MOT at a rate R. This rate depends
upon the size and intensity of the laser cooling and trap-
ping beams and the Rb partial pressure. Atoms with
velocities below a critical velocity will be captured by
the trap. Atoms are also lost from the trap due to col-
lisions, limiting the number that can be loaded into the
MOT. The rate equation for the number, N , of trapped
atoms is given by

dN
dt

= R − N (cid:18) 1

τRb(cid:19) − βZ n2dV,

(1)

where 1/τb is the trap loss rate due to collisions with
background gas atoms and 1/τRb is the loss rate deter-
mined by collisions with untrapped Rb atoms. The trap
density, n in the volume integral, contributes to density-
dependent losses within the trap with a loss coeﬃcient
of β. The loss rate 1/τb is proportional to the pressure
of the background gas, and like R, 1/τRb is proportional
to the Rb partial pressure.
In the absence of density-
dependent collisional losses (β = 0) [12], and with a Rb
partial pressure that is much higher than the background
pressure (1/τRb ≫ 1/τb), the rate equation becomes

.

The limiting number, Nlim, that can be loaded into the
MOT is obtained when the increase in number due to

loading balances the loss due to collisions. At this point,
N = Nlim and dN/dt = 0, yielding

independent of the Rb partial pressure [5].

Frequently, the background-gas collisions can not be
neglected, and the total number reached will be less than
Nlim. The maximum number Nmax that can be captured
for a given Rb partial pressure will then be given by

Our stainless steel vacuum chamber consisted of a va-
por cell atom trapping chamber with indium-sealed win-
dows, a liquid nitrogen-ﬁlled cold ﬁnger which protruded
into the chamber, and a Rb cold ﬁnger at 0◦C, as shown
in Fig. 1. The vacuum in the chamber was maintained
by a Ti-sublimation pump and an ion pump. We main-
tained a Rb vapor in the chamber by slightly opening a
valve between the chamber and a Rb cold ﬁnger. This
replenished Rb that was pumped out of the chamber.

Because of the appearance of τMOT as the time constant
in the exponential, we deﬁne τMOT as the ”MOT loading
time.”

The lifetime of a magnetic trap in the same chamber
also depends upon the collision rate of trapped atoms
with background atoms. Thus the magnetic trap life-
time τ is proportional to τMOT. We express this propor-
tionality as τ = τMOT/α, where for our traps, α ∼ 4.
For evaporative cooling experiments, where large num-
bers of atoms and long magnetic trap lifetimes are both
necessary, the product of total number Nmax and mag-
netic trap lifetime is the critical parameter to maximize
[13]. Because of the relationship between τ and τMOT,
we can alternatively view this requirement as maximizing
the product of Nmax and τMOT. We must therefore ﬁnd
the optimum Rb partial pressure for a given background
pressure. Multiplying Eq. 4 by τMOT leads to maximiza-
tion of τ 2
MOT/τb (Nlim is independent of vapor pressure).
Under optimal conditions, with constant Rb partial pres-
sure, NmaxτMOT is maximized for τb = τRb = τMOT/2
and hence Nmax = Nlim/2 and NmaxτMOT = Nlimτb/4.

However, we can further improve the number-lifetime
product (which from now on we will generally designate
as N τ ) by permitting a modulation of the Rb vapor pres-
sure. If the Rb partial pressure is temporarily increased
until the trap contains the maximum possible number of
atoms (N = Nmax = Nlim), at which point the Rb vapor
is suddenly reduced to a negligible level (τMOT ∼ τb), an
increase of a factor of 4 in N τ will be realized. Further-
more, the time needed to load the MOT is signiﬁcantly
shortened when τRb ≪ τb during the loading interval,
increasing the repetition rate of the experiment.

The goal of our experiment was to realize gains in N τ
by modulating the Rb vapor pressure in the described
manner with the white light source, thus improving con-
ditions for evaporative cooling and obtaining BEC.

FIG. 1. An illustration of our apparatus. The MOT was
formed in the atom trapping chamber, and the WLS light
entered into the chamber through a window.

The MOT was constructed using a forced dark SPOT
technique [13,14]: a 4 mm opaque spot was placed in the
center of the path of the repumping laser light, and was
imaged onto the region in the chamber where the trap
was formed. Another laser beam ﬁlled the hole in the re-
pumping beam, and was used to optically pump trapped
atoms into a dark state. This technique reduced the trap
loss rate due to light-assisted, density-dependent colli-
sions between trapped atoms. The Rb trapping light was
tuned 13 MHz below the 5S1/2, F = 2 → 5P3/2, F ′ = 3
transition, and was provided by six 23 mW/cm2, 1.2 cm
diameter laser beams. The 2.7 mW/cm2 repumping laser
beam was tuned 15 MHz below the F = 1 → F ′ = 2
transition, and the 9 mW/cm2 forced optical pumping
light was tuned to the F = 2 → F ′ = 2 transition. The
number of atoms in the trap was measured by detecting
light scattered by the trapped atoms. This was done by
turning oﬀ the F = 2 → F ′ = 2 light for ∼ 50 ms and
ﬁlling the hole in the repumping beam with a separate
bypass repumping beam such that the trapped atoms
were made bright by scattering light from the trapping
beams. A fraction of the light scattered by the trapped
atoms was collected and focused onto a calibrated pho-
tomultiplier tube. Loading rates (R) and MOT loading
time constants (τMOT) were measured by detecting the
number of atoms at sequential points in time as the trap
ﬁlled.

The white light used to enhance trap loading was pro-
vided by a ﬁber optic illuminator, consisting of a halo-
gen bulb with variable power and a ﬁber bundle which
pointed the light into the vapor cell. The coupling of the
light from the bulb into the ﬁber gave a maximum inten-
sity onto the inner vapor cell wall of ∼ 10 W/cm2. The
WLS was switched on and oﬀ electronically.

To measure τMOT, we measured the number of atoms
loaded into the trap as a function of time both with and
without the WLS. The loading curves were exponential in
time, as expected for a trap without light-assisted losses.
Typical ﬁlling curves are shown in Fig. 2(a) for various
WLS intensities. In the ﬁgure, the curve representing the
fastest ﬁlling rate, with a WLS intensity of ∼ 10 W/cm2,
shows a loading time constant of τMOT = 67 s and a max-
imum number of ∼ 1.3 × 108 atoms as determined by the
exponential ﬁt. Without the WLS, the loading time con-
stant was τMOT = 538 s and the maximum number was
∼ 2 × 107 atoms. Values of number loaded and loading
time constants for the curves shown in Fig. 2(a) are given
in the second and third columns of Table I

represent a WLS intensity of ∼ 5 W/cm2, and the open circles
represent a WLS intensity of ∼ 2 W/cm2. The closed circles
in (a) represent loading without the WLS. See Table I for a
numerical summary of the data shown in these plots.

A key factor to consider in optimizing N τ using the
WLS scheme is the time for the vapor pressure to return
to lower equilibrium values once the WLS is switched oﬀ.
We deﬁne this time as the vapor pressure recovery time.
A liquid nitrogen cold ﬁnger in the main chamber was
used to decrease the Rb vapor pressure and shorten the
recovery time after the WLS was switched oﬀ.
In our
cell, the cold ﬁnger had little eﬀect on the background
gas pressure, but shortened the recovery time by a factor
of ∼ 2. Furthermore, our experimental timing sequence
consisted of a MOT loading phase with the WLS switched
on, followed by a MOT holding phase, during which the
atoms were held in a MOT with the WLS switched oﬀ.
This enabled us to keep a large number of atoms trapped
while waiting for the vapor pressure to decrease before
extinguishing the trapping light.

In order to evaluate vapor pressure recovery times, we
measured the dependence of loading rates on time just
after the WLS was switched oﬀ. For the data shown
in Fig. 2(b), the WLS was left on until the Rb partial
pressure reached a saturated level. The WLS light was
then turned oﬀ, and the number of atoms loaded into a
MOT in 5 seconds was repeatedly measured. After each
measurement, the MOT light was kept oﬀ for 5 s, and
then the MOT started ﬁlling again for the subsequent
5 s ﬁlling rate measurement. This set of measurements
indicated the speed at which τMOT and the Rb vapor
pressure could recover after the WLS was turned oﬀ, and
demonstrated that the recovery time was roughly inde-
pendent of the WLS intensity. The fastest loading rate
shown with the WLS on was ∼ 8 × 105 atoms/s, and
with the light oﬀ was ∼ 2.7 × 104 atoms/s. Each loading
rate vs. time curve in Fig. 2(b) was ﬁt with a sum of two
decaying exponential curves. The time constants for the
loading rate to return to lower equilibrium values were
∼ 8 s for the fast recovery time (τrec,1), and between 113
s and 167 s for the slower recovery time (τrec,2). Table I
contains a list of recovery times.

To help evaluate the vapor cell performance, the values
for Nlim and τb were estimated by measuring N and τMOT
for various Rb partial pressures. Experimentally, we var-
ied the Rb partial pressure by adjusting the intensity of
the WLS. We estimated τb ∼ 700 s and Nlim = 1.9 × 108
atoms for our operating parameters by linear extrapola-
tion with our data.

IV. MODEL

We now describe a detailed model for determining the
numbers and lifetimes of traps loaded with the WLS to
demonstrate the possibility of increasing N τ under re-
alistic experimental conditions. Speciﬁcally, this model
includes the eﬀects of ﬁnite vapor pressure recovery times
and ﬁnite loading times. Without the use of the WLS,
and with long loading times, N τ in a magnetic trap can
obtain a maximum optimal value of

(N τ )opt ≡ Nlimτb/4α

(7)

with τRb = τb. We will compare the performance of a
WLS-loaded MOT to (N τ )opt to demonstrate the eﬀec-
tiveness of a WLS-loaded MOT.

For a trap loaded with the WLS, calculating N τ is
more complicated. We divide the experimental cycle into
three time periods. During the ﬁrst period, the MOT
is loaded, and the WLS remains on for the duration of
this period. We call this period the MOT loading phase,
which has a duration of time t1. The cycle then enters
the MOT holding phase, which has a duration of time
t2. In the holding phase, the WLS remains oﬀ, allowing
the vapor pressure to recover while continuing to hold a
large fraction of the trapped atoms in the MOT. In the
third period of the cycle, the MOT beams are also turned
oﬀ and the atoms are trapped in a magnetic trap. This
period begins at time tT = t1 + t2.

Variables for the number of atoms in the trap can be
deﬁned at the boundaries of the time periods. At the
beginning of the loading phase, N = 0. By the end of
the loading phase at time t1, N1 atoms are in the MOT.
The cycle then enters the holding phase, during which
some atoms are lost from the trap due to collisions with
other trapped atoms at a rate that is faster than the
decreasing loading rate into the trap. We deﬁne NWLS to
be the number of trapped atoms remaining at the end of
this period. The “WLS” subscript emphasizes that this
number was obtained using the WLS. The cycle then
enters the magnetic trap phase, and NWLS atoms are
loaded into the magnetic trap. Because of the continually
decreasing vapor pressure (from having used the WLS
and then turning it oﬀ), the number of atoms in the
magnetic trap decays faster than exponentially. Since we
desire to maximize the number-lifetime product for the
magnetic trap, we deﬁne an eﬀective lifetime τWLS as the

time at which the number of atoms in the magnetic trap
has reached (1/e)NWLS. The entire cycle as described is
illustrated in Fig. 3.

FIG. 3. The timing sequence used in the experiment and in
the calculations. The plot is a representation of the number
of trapped atoms as a function of time. The dashed lines
separate the diﬀerent stages of trap loading and holding. The
number of trapped atoms at the end of the MOT loading and
holding phases is given above the N vs. time curve. The states
of the MOT and the WLS are also listed for the time intervals
t1 and t2. After the MOT holding phase, at time tT = t1 + t2,
NWLS atoms are assumed to be loaded from the MOT into a
magnetic trap.

Our intent in this analysis is to compare NWLSτWLS
with both N τ for unmodulated Rb pressures at vary-
ing loading times and with (N τ )opt, as deﬁned in Eq. 7.
First, we calculate the number of atoms N1 in the MOT
at t1. At the beginning of the MOT loading phase, the
WLS is turned on, and the loading time constant asso-
ciated with the Rb partial pressure quickly drops to a
value of τ1. We thus obtain

N1 =

Nlim

1 + τ1/τb

[1 − exp (−t1 [1/τ1 + 1/τb])]

(8)

from the use of Eqs. 6 and 4.

The trapped atoms then enter the holding phase. The
WLS is turned oﬀ, and the number of atoms in the
MOT is governed by the rate equation dN/dt = R(t) −
N/τ2(t) − N/τb, where τ2 is the loading time constant as-
sociated with the decaying Rb vapor pressure. The time
dependence of R and τ2 is made explicit, since these val-
ues depend upon the decreasing Rb vapor pressure. The
loading rate R(t) and the loss rate 1/τ2(t) are assumed
to decay exponentially (with a time constant of the va-
por pressure recovery time) to the steady-state values
R(t) → 0 and 1/τ2 → 0 (negligible Rb vapor pressures)
as the vapor pressure recovers. The rate equation is nu-
merically integrated to determine the number of atoms,
NWLS, left in the MOT at time tT, the point at which
the MOT is turned oﬀ.

We ﬁnally must determine the eﬀective lifetime τWLS of
the magnetic trapping phase of the cycle by numerically

4

solving the rate equation dN/dt = −α(N/τ3(t) − N/τb).
Here, 1/τ3(t) has an initial value of 1/τ2(t2) and de-
cays exponentially in time to 0 as the vapor pressure
continues to recover. Finally, we can write the number-
lifetime product of the WLS-loaded MOT, designated by
(N τ )WLS, as (N τ )WLS = NWLSτWLS.

V. RESULTS

We numerically investigated the performance of the
MOT loaded with the WLS by comparing (N τ )WLS with
N τ for unmodulated pressures (Fig. 4). Figure 4(a)
shows the number-lifetime product due to trapping atoms
in a MOT for a time tT = τb as a function of the frac-
tion of the loading cycle that the WLS is used. We
assume that Nmax = Nlim/2 for unmodulated partial
pressures, and an arbitrarily chosen value of Nmax =
Nlim/(1 + τ1/τb) = (0.9)Nlim (see Eq. 8), or equivalently
τ1 = (0.1)τb, for the modulated partial pressures. Here,
the chosen value of Nmax can not be set to Nlim due to
limitations in the numerical calculations. Fig. 4(b) shows
the same conditions as Fig. 4(a), but here we have plotted
the ratio of (N τ )WLS to N τ with unmodulated pressures
after a total MOT trapping time of tT.

As suggested by Fig. 4, the optimum time to leave on
the WLS is determined by the maximum point on a given
curve. In the calculations, the gain in N τ after using the
WLS is less than the maximum possible value of 4 due
to the need to allow the vapor pressure to recover before
loading the atoms into a magnetic trap. The highest
values that can be achieved for N τ with and without the
WLS are plotted against total loading time tT in Fig. 5
for the same conditions as in Fig. 4. The gain in using the
WLS is again less than the ideal maximum factor of 4 for
long loading times. However, for short loading times, N τ
for unmodulated pressures is much lower than (N τ )opt as
shown by the gray curve in Fig. 5(a). Modulated vapor
pressures can give substantial beneﬁts in this regime, as
shown by the larger N τ ratios in Fig. 5(b).

As a concrete example of reading the plots given here,
we assume that we have a system that has a vapor pres-
sure recovery time of 0.035τb. Thus we are interested
in the uppermost curves in Figs. 4(a-d) and 5(a,b).
If
we load the vapor cell MOT without modulating the Rb
partial pressure, we can achieve a value of N τ ∼ 1 (in
units of (N τ )opt ≡ Nlimτb/4α) after loading the trap for
a total time of tT = 2τb, as shown in the lower (gray)
curve of Fig. 5(a). However, if we modulate the Rb pres-
sure with the WLS, we can triple the value of N τ for
the same total MOT trapping time. To determine the
proper time to remove the WLS light, Fig. 4(c) indicates
beginning the MOT holding phase 0.12τb before loading
the magnetic trap (thus t1 = 1.88τb) for optimum trap
loading.

(a) The calculated products (N τ )WLS in units
of (N τ )opt ≡ Nlimτb/4α, the maximum value that can be
achieved with unmodulated vapor pressures, after a total
MOT trapping time of tT = τb. The Rb-limited lifetime
is assumed to quickly decrease to τ1 = τb/10 when the WLS
is turned on. The curves show (N τ )WLS at varying times t1
(as a fraction of tT), the point in the MOT loading cycle at
which the WLS is turned oﬀ, with the remaining time in the
cycle (tT − t1) permitting recovery of the Rb partial pressure
with a time constant of 0.035τb (black line), 0.05τb (dotted),
0.1τb (short dashed), 0.15τb (dashed-dotted), and 0.2τb (long
dashed). N τ for unmodulated vapor pressure is shown as a
solid gray line, after a loading time of τT = τb. (Note that for
this value to equal (N τ )opt, an inﬁnite loading time would be
needed.) (b) The ratios of the upper curves in (a) to the value
of N τ for unmodulated vapor pressure after a MOT trapping
time of τT = τb. (c,d) Same as for (a) and (b), with a total
loading time of tT = 2τb. Graphs (c) and (d) look nearly iden-
tical because N τ for unmodulated partial pressures is nearly
equal to (N τ )opt after loading for tT = 2τb. The four graphs
(a)-(d) shown in this ﬁgure demonstrate that for a given re-
covery time and MOT trapping time (tT), there is an optimal
WLS duration (t1) the maximum point on the plotted curves.

Alternatively, we can shorten the loading time tT to
∼ 0.5τb, as demonstrated in Fig. 5(a), and maintain the
same gain in N τ . In doing so, we would not only gain a
factor of 3 in N τ , but we would also increase the repeti-
tion rate of the experiment by as much as a factor of 4.
If instead we load the experiment for a ﬁxed amount of
time in either case (with or without the WLS), we should
look at Fig. 5(b) to compare the N τ products. For a total
MOT trapping time of tT = 0.4τb, we would achieve over
a ﬁve-fold gain in N τ by modulating the vapor pressure
with the WLS.

that can possibly be loaded into the WLS trap is assumed to
be (0.9)Nlim (top curves), or equivalently τ1 = τb/10 when
the WLS is turned on. The curves represent recovery times
0.035τb (black line), 0.05τb (dotted), 0.1τb (short dashed),
0.15τb (dashed-dotted), and 0.2τb (long dashed). The vari-
ation of non-WLS number-lifetime product with time (solid
gray line) is shown. The calculations assume that for any par-
ticular value of tT, the WLS is turned oﬀ at the optimal t1
(see Fig. 4). The vertical axis is scaled to (N τ )opt. (b) The

reached with a loading time of 3τb = 466 s. Without
the WLS, the Rb partial pressure was optimized when
τMOT = τRb/2 = τb/2 and N = Nlim/2. This number of
N τ is inferred from measurements of Nlim and τb men-
tioned previously.

Note that in addition to the gain in N τ , the time to
reach the above value of (N τ )WLS is 3.1 times faster than
the time to reach the above value of (N τ )opt (without the
WLS), tripling the repetition rate of experiments. The
WLS experimental technique would be even more beneﬁ-
cial by shortening the recovery time of the vapor pressure.
This might be accomplished by keeping a larger fraction
of the inner surface of the vapor cell at cryogenic temper-
atures or through optimization of the surface adsorption
chemistry.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY

The use of LIAD to enhance loading of vapor cell
MOTs may be applicable to other atomic species.
Lithium vapor cells, for instance, are diﬃcult to work
with due to the high temperatures needed to create a
substantial Li vapor. Yet if LIAD were to work well with
Li adsorbed on stainless steel, or between co-adsorbed
Li atoms on a surface, a Li vapor cell MOT would be
practical. Although the eﬀect has not yet been quantita-
tively explored as it has been for Rb, we observed a LIAD
induced increase in the loading rate into a Cs MOT in
a Cs vapor cell with aluminum walls. In general, when
ﬁrst using the LIAD technique, the WLS intensity should
be raised incrementally to monitor the loading time con-
stant. When the WLS loading time constant becomes
too short (< 10 s) the vapor pressure can potentially be-
come high enough that atoms may re-adsorb onto cold
chamber windows and may possibly form small clusters
of atoms.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the technique
of non-thermal light induced atom desorption can be used
to eﬀectively increase the number of atoms that can be
loaded into a vapor cell MOT. This technique beneﬁts
atom trapping experiments where large numbers of atoms
and long trap lifetimes are crucial.

Experimentally, we were able to obtain an N τ prod-
uct of (N τ )WLS = 5.0 × 109 atoms·s using the WLS
technique, achieved with a MOT loading phase of du-
ration t1 = 100 s and a MOT holding phase of duration
t2 = 50 s. This value of (N τ )WLS is 2.2 times larger
than (N τ )opt = 2.3 × 109 atoms·s, 95% of the maxi-
mum value of (N τ )opt for optimized Rb partial pressure,

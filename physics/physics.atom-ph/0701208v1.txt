Abstract

The alignment of nuclear states resonantly formed in nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) is

studied by means of a density matrix technique. The vibrational excitations of the nucleus are described

by a collective model and the electrons are treated in a relativistic framework. Formulas for the angular

distribution of photons emitted in the nuclear relaxation are derived. We present numerical results for

alignment parameters and photon angular distributions for a number of heavy elements in the case of E2

nuclear transitions. Our results are intended to help future experimental attempts to discern NEEC from

radiative recombination, which is the dominant competing process.

INTRODUCTION

The process studied in this paper consists of two steps. First, a free electron is recombined

into an electronic shell of a positive, preferably highly charged ion while resonantly transferring

its excess energy to the nucleus. This step is referred to as nuclear excitation by electron capture

(NEEC) in the literature. It is the time-reversed process of internal conversion (IC) and can also

be regarded as the nuclear analogue of dielectronic recombination (DR), where a bound electron

is resonantly excited. In the second step, the excited nuclear state thus formed decays radiatively.

The whole process is illustrated in Fig. 1. Proposed for the ﬁrst time in Ref. [1], the NEEC

recombination mechanism has not been observed experimentally yet.

Related processes at the borderline between nuclear and atomic physics have been experimen-

tally conﬁrmed, such as nuclear excitation by electronic transition (NEET), that is a decay mode

of the electron atomic shell in which energy is transferred to the nucleus. NEET has been observed

in 189Os [2], 237Np [3], and, most recently, in 197Au [4]. For its time-reversed process, the bound

internal conversion (BIC), a direct experimental evidence was not found until recently [5].

The detection of the recombined ions or the emitted radiation characteristic for the nuclear

decay can be used to observe NEEC experimentally. The position of the peak in the recombination

cross section or the spectrum of emitted photons directly yields the nuclear transition energy.

The detected spectra may provide further information on nuclear decay mechanisms and level

population. Thus, the study of NEEC in recombination experiments can also be regarded as a

possible novel tool to investigate nuclear properties.

In a previous paper [6], we presented total NEEC cross sections for a range of heavy isotopes.

Recently, the quantum interference of NEEC and the background process of radiative recombina-

tion (RR) was investigated [7]. In the present work we study a new aspect, namely, the alignment,

i.e., the magnetic sublevel population of the nuclear excited states generated in the resonant re-

combination process. The alignment of the nuclear excited state also allows one to derive the

angular distribution of the radiation emitted in the nuclear relaxation process and the cross section

differential with respect to the photon emission angle. Differential cross sections for the similar

process of DR have been investigated theoretically [8, 9, 10, 11] and experimentally [12, 13].

The photon angular distribution is of general interest for experimental implementations aiming

at observing NEEC by the detection of radiation. Furthermore, as found in this work, the photon

emission pattern is substantially different from the one of the concurrent process of RR, which

state (E) and again to its ground state. The ﬁgure below shows the geometry of the process.

may help to discern the two channels.

The reorientation of the nuclear axis caused by the electric ﬁeld of a charged particle that excites

the nucleus is a well-studied process in nuclear physics. The change in the nuclear spin directions

following the Coulomb excitation of the nucleus by collisions with low-energy charged particles

affects the angular distribution of the emitted γ rays [14]. In the case of the electric radiative

transitions, NEEC can be regarded as a Coulomb excitation with free electrons that are in the end

recombined into a bound state of the ion.

We apply a density matrix formalism to describe the alignment of rotationally excited nuclear

states formed by NEEC and the angular distribution of the de-excitation radiation. Nuclear states

are treated in the framework of the nuclear collective model and the electrons are described by

Dirac four-component wave functions, as necessary for the heavy elements studied here. The

electron-nucleus interaction operator is expanded in spherical multipoles to facilitate the evalu-

3

ation of transition matrix elements. This theoretical approach is presented in detail in Sec. II.

NEEC nuclear alignment parameters are presented for the case of E2 excitations in heavy highly

charged ions and differential cross sections are compared to the same quantity corresponding to

the background process of RR in Sec. III. The relevance of these results for future experiments

targeting the observation of NEEC is discussed. We brieﬂy summarize the ﬁndings of the paper in

Sec. IV. Atomic units are used throughout this work unless otherwise speciﬁed.

II. THEORETICAL FORMALISM

Since its introduction in 1927 by von Neumann and Landau, the density matrix approach has

been found to be a useful and elegant tool in many ﬁelds of modern physics. For applications in

atomic physics, and combined particularly with the concept of spherical tensors, this approach was

originally developed by Fano [15] in the 1950s. Since then, the density matrix theory has been

utilized successfully in many case studies on atomic collisions, e.g., for describing the excitation of

atomic autoionizing states, polarization effects in radiative and Auger decays, cascade processes,

or lifetime interferences in resonantly excited atoms.

In this paper we apply a density matrix formalism to describe the two–step process in which

(i) a free (or quasi–free) electron is captured into the bound state of an initially bare ion with

excitation of the atomic nucleus which (ii) subsequently decays under the emission of character-

istic radiation. Because the properties of this radiation are closely related to the alignment of the

excited nuclear state, we ﬁrst have to investigate the population of these states as it arises due to

the electron capture process. Therefore, in Section II A, we derive the general formulas for the

density matrix of the excited nuclear states produced by electron capture. In particular, we show

how the sublevel population of these states can be described in terms of the so–called alignment

parameters. The calculation of these parameters involves the NEEC transition amplitudes and re-

quires the use of a nuclear model. Following Ref. [6], the NEEC transition amplitudes are derived

in Section II B. Finally, in Section II C we consider the subsequent nuclear decay and obtain the

angular distribution of the de–excitation photons with the help of the alignment parameters.

A. Alignment of the excited nuclear state

Within the density matrix theory, the state of a physical system is described in terms of sta-

tistical (or density) operators. These operators can be considered to represent, for instance, an

ensemble of systems which are—altogether—in either a pure quantum state or in a mixture of dif-

ferent states with any degree of coherence. Then, the basic idea of the density matrix formalism is

to accompany such an ensemble through the collision process, starting from a well-deﬁned initial

state and by passing through one or, possibly, several intermediate states until the ﬁnal state of the

collision process is attained.

In NEEC, the initial state of the combined system is given by the electron with a well–deﬁned

asymptotic momentum p and spin projection ms, and an ion which is speciﬁed in term of its

nuclear charge Z and its initial nuclear spin quantum numbers Ii and projection Mi. (We note

here that we consider recombination into bare or closed shell ions, thus the angular momentum

of the bound electron shell is zero.) Assuming that these two subsystems, ion and electron, are

uncorrelated, the overall initial density operator is given as the direct product of the two initial

subsystems’ density operators:

ρi = ρion ⊗
If neither the electrons nor the ions are polarized initially, an averaging over the magnetic quantum

where Ni denotes all the additional quantum numbers needed for a unique speciﬁcation of the

nuclear states.

In the intermediate state d formed by the capture of the electron, the statistical operators have

to describe both the electron in some bound ionic state

quantum number of the bound one-electron state, respectively. As known from density matrix

theory, the statistical operators of the initial and the (subsequent) intermediate states of the system

are connected by

where Ten is the transition operator for the electron–nucleus interaction which causes the nuclear

excitation. The particular form of this operator will be given in Section II B.

Instead of applying equation (3), in practice, it is often more convenient to rewrite the statistical

operators in a matrix representation. For instance, in a basis with well-deﬁned angular momenta,

the intermediate-state density matrix is given by

the intermediate–state density matrix (4) still contains the complete information about the NEEC

process and, thus, can be used to derive all the properties of the bound electron and the excited

nucleus. For instance, assuming that the magnetic states md of the bound electron remain unob-

by the screening electrons in the Dirac-Fock approximation [17] and numerically determining the

phases for the combined nuclear and screening potentials.

B. Calculation of the transition amplitudes

The expression of the statistical tensors involves the matrix element of the transition operator

Ten that describes the electron-nucleus interaction in the case of electric transitions of the nucleus.

We adopt in the following the Coulomb gauge as it allows the separation of the dominant Coulomb

interaction between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. The transition operator corre-

sponds in lowest order to the interaction Hamiltonian Hen applied in [6]:

In the above equation, ρn(~rn) is the nuclear charge density, ~rn denotes the nuclear coordinate and

~re the electronic coordinate. The integration is performed over the whole nuclear volume. The

matrix element of the transition operator Ten enters the expression of the NEEC rate for electric

transitions [6]

R

In order to describe the nuclear transition we use a phenomenological collective model [18]

that interprets the characteristic band structures in the energy range up to 2 MeV in the case

of deformed even-even nuclei as vibrations and rotations of the nuclear surface. The even-even

nuclei have usually a low-lying 2+ ﬁrst excited state, which is characterized by a strong electric

E2 transition to the ground state. The nuclear surface is parametrized as

where the amplitudes αℓm describe the deviations of the nuclear surface with respect to the sphere

of radius R0 and thus serve as collective coordinates. Using this parametrization and requiring that

the charge be homogeneously distributed, the nuclear charge density can be written as

ρn(~rn) = ρ0Θ (R(θn, ϕn)

with the constant charge density of the undeformed nucleus given by ρ0 = 3Z

As the vibration amplitudes of the nuclear surface are supposed to be small, we neglect the terms
of higher order in the collective coordinates αℓm. While the ﬁrst term ρ0Θ(R0 −

nuclear excitation and enters the expression of the transition operator Ten in Eq. (12) [6]. We can

By making use of the multipole transition amplitudes (25), we are able to calculate now the

alignment parameters (11) of the nucleus excited by electron capture. A detailed knowledge of

the alignment parameters is required for the analysis of the subsequent de-excitation of the nu-

cleus which may result in the emission of one (or several) photons until the nuclear ground state

is reached. This photon emission is characterized (apart from its known energy) by its angular

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we present the alignment parameters and the angular distribution of the emitted

photons that follow NEEC into the 1s orbitals of bare ions and the 2s states of initially He-like

ions. We consider the even-even nuclei 174

66 Dy for which NEEC total cross
sections for the capture into the K-shell have been presented in Ref. [6]. The reduced transition

2) for these nuclei as well as the energies of the nuclear transitions are

→

taken from Ref. [26]. The calculation of the statistical tensors involves the numerical integration

of RL,κd,κ. For the continuum electron we use relativistic Coulomb-Dirac wave functions, applying

the approximation that the nucleus is a point-like charge. We assume that the free electron, which

is far away from the ion, is not sensitive to the internal structure or size of the nucleus. The

radial wave functions have been calculated using the same computer routine as in Ref. [6], and

cross-checked with the program described in Ref. [27]. The Coulomb phases calculated according

to Eq. (7) do not include the effect of the ﬁnite nuclear size, which is expected to be negligible.

For the continuum electrons recombining into the 2s orbital of an initially He-like ion, we use an

effective nuclear charge number of Zeﬀ = Z

2. This approximation is assumed to be sufﬁcient

−

for the present level of accuracy. We consider relativistic wave functions calculated with the

GRASP92 package [28] for the bound state. The ﬁnite size of the nucleus, i.e., its non-zero radius

R0, is considered in the bound wave functions and has a sensitive effect on the inner-shell level

energies of the bound electron. The nuclear radius in calculated according to the semi-empirical

formula [29]

R0 = (1.0793 A1/3 + 0.73587) fm ,

(34)

where A is the atomic mass number.

In the case of recombination into the 2s orbital of an initially He-like ion, the phase shifts of the

partial continuum wave functions were calculated by considering the Dirac-Fock (DF) approxima-

tion of the 1s2 ground state seen by the free electron. As shown in Table I, the difference between

such a calculation and the Zeﬀ = Z

2 full screening approximation is very small in the Coulomb

phase, less than 0.01 rad and has a negligible effect on the alignment parameters. In Table I we

present the Coulomb phases for the capture into the 1s orbital and 2s orbitals of the considered

ions, the latter calculated using both approximations.

The values of the alignment parameters

A4 of the 2+ excited nuclear states are presented
in Table II. Capture into the 1s as well as the 2s orbitals are considered. The alignment of the

A2 and

excited nuclear state characterized by these parameters gives in the second step of NEEC the

angular distribution of the emitted radiation. In Figure 2 we present the angular distribution W (θ)

given in Eq. (33) for the capture into the 1s and 2s shells of 154

70 Yb,
respectively. The angular patterns are similar for all the four ions, as they all involve E2 transitions

of nuclei with near atomic and mass numbers. Both radiations following the capture into the 1s

and 2s orbitals of the ion present maxima at θ = 45◦ and θ = 135◦, a pattern which signiﬁcantly

differs from that of RR [30]. While for the capture into the 1s orbitals the radiation intensity

emitted at θ = 0◦, 90◦, 180◦ appears to be negligible, the pattern for the capture into 2s displays

free electron is dominated by the E1 transition and has an angular distribution (roughly given by

a sin2θ function) with a maximum at θ = 78◦ in the center-of-mass frame.

As the RR and NEEC angular distributions of the emitted photons have maxima at different

values of θ, we calculate the ratio between the two angular differential cross sections at different

emission angles,

for the case of electron capture into bare ytterbium. We consider here the angles θmax =
45◦, 78◦, 135◦ that correspond to the maxima of NEEC and RR radiation angular distributions.

The NEEC total cross section is convoluted with the energy distribution of the continuum elec-

trons assuming a Gaussian width parameter of 0.1 eV. The RR angular differential cross section

is calculated within the framework of Dirac’s relativistic equation and by taking into account the

higher (non–dipole) terms in the expansion of the electron–photon interaction [16, 30, 31]. We

assume that the RR and NEEC alignment parameters are constant on the studied energy interval

(35)

of approximately 1 eV.

We envisage the scenario of a possible NEEC experiment in a storage ring, in which the radi-

ation is emitted by the nucleus of the Yb69+ ion moving relativistically with respect to the labo-

ratory frame. A Lorentz transformation of the NEEC and RR angular differential cross sections

systems for the case of NEEC into the 1s orbital of Yb70+.

In Fig. 4 we present the ratio in Eq. (35) as a function of the continuum electron energy for

the three values of the photon emission angle θ in the laboratory frame, for which dσNEEC(θ)/dΩ

or dσRR(θ)/dΩ have a maximum. In the laboratory frame, the NEEC angular distribution has

maxima at θ = 52◦ and 142◦, while in the case of RR the peak is at approximately θ = 86◦. The

ratio of the NEEC and RR angular differential cross sections is more than one order of magnitude

larger for θ = 52◦ and 142◦ than in the case of θ = 86◦. If the photons emitted perpendicular to the

direction of the incoming electron are measured in an experiment, it is most likely that only the RR

background will be detected, as the NEEC differential cross section presents a minimum at θ =

98◦. For the emission angles θ = 52◦ and θ = 142◦ the RR contribution at the resonance electron

energy Ec is considerably lower in comparison to the total cross sections of the recombination

SUMMARY

In this work we consider the alignment of nuclear states formed in the process of nuclear

excitation by electron capture. We calculate alignment parameters and geometric factors which

determine the angular distribution of the subsequently emitted gamma photons. Such distribution

functions are presented for a range of heavy elements with E2 nuclear de-excitation transitions.

As the emission pattern of nuclear gamma photons is found to be substantially different from the

emission characteristics of the background process of radiative recombination, our ﬁndings may

help experimental attempts to discern NEEC from the competing process. E.g., in the case of

the 174

70 Yb nucleus with an E2 transition, the best chance to observe the NEEC resonance is at an
angle of θ = 142◦. This emphasizes the importance of measuring photon angle-resolved cross

sections. Furthermore, the knowledge of the maxima and minima of the angular distribution of

gamma radiation following NEEC is of general interest for any measurement aiming to observe

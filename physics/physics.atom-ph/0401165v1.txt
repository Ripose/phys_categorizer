Abstract
We report a value for the D2-line frequency of 39K with 0.25 ppb uncertainty. The frequency is

measured using an evacuated ring-cavity resonator whose length is calibrated against a reference

laser. The D2 line presents a problem in identifying the line center because the closely-spaced

energy levels of the excited state are not resolved. We use computer modelling of the measured

spectrum to extract the line center and obtain a value of 391 015 578.040(75) MHz. In conjunction

with our previous measurement of the D1 line, we determine the ﬁne-structure interval in the 4P

state to be 1 729 997.132(90) MHz. The results represent signiﬁcant improvement over previous

values.

INTRODUCTION

Precise measurements of atomic energy levels continue to play an important role in the

development of physics. The energy levels of alkali atoms are particularly important because

these atoms can be laser cooled to ultra-low temperatures for subsequent use in precision

spectroscopy experiments. For example, precise measurements of the D1 line in Cs [1], Rb

or K [2], in conjunction with photon-recoil shift measurements in an atom interferometer [3],

could yield an independent value of the ﬁne-structure constant α. In addition, a precise value

of the frequency of the D2 line in Cs [4] is required for atom-interferometric measurements

of the local gravitational acceleration [5].

We have recently developed a technique for measuring the absolute frequencies of optical

transitions with sub-MHz precision [6, 7]. The frequency is measured using a ring-cavity
resonator whose length is calibrated against a reference laser locked to the D2 line of 87Rb.

The frequency of the reference laser is known to an accuracy of 10 kHz [8]. We have already
used this technique to measure the D1 lines in the alkali atoms 39K, 85Rb, and 87Rb with 0.13

ppb uncertainty [2], to facilitate measurements of α. In this paper, we apply this technique to
measure the D2 line of 39K with an uncertainty of 0.25 ppb. This represents an improvement

of more than two orders of magnitude over tabulated values [9]. Furthermore, in combination

with our previous measurement of the D1 line, we obtain the ﬁne-structure interval in the
4P state of 39K with very high precision. Knowledge of ﬁne-structure intervals is useful in

the study of atomic collisions and relativistic calculations of atomic energy levels. Indeed, a

combination of improved methods of calculation and increasingly precise measurements of

atomic ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure (e.g. in Li [10]) can lead to a precise value of α [11].

The D2 line in K presents a problem in determining the line center because transitions

to individual hyperﬁne levels of the excited state are not resolved in conventional saturated-

absorption spectroscopy. This is because the various hyperﬁne levels in the 4P3/2 state lie

within 30 MHz of each other [12], while the natural linewidth is 6 MHz. We have recently

demonstrated a technique to resolve such closely-spaced transitions [13], however, in this

work we use computer simulation of the measured spectrum to extract the line center with
an accuracy of ∼100 kHz.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The experimental schematic is shown in Fig. 1 and has been described extensively in a

previous publication [2]. The four-mirror ring-cavity is placed inside a vacuum chamber and
evacuated to a pressure of ∼10−2 torr to eliminate frequency shifts due to dispersion of air.

Lasers 1 and 2 are standard external-cavity diode lasers stabilized using optical feedback

from a piezo-mounted grating [14]. The reference laser (Laser1) is locked to the D2 line of
87Rb using saturated-absorption spectroscopy in a vapor cell, and the cavity is locked to the

reference laser. In general, the frequency of the laser to be measured (Laser2) will be oﬀset

from the nearest cavity resonance. This oﬀset is compensated by using an acousto-optic

modulator (AOM) between Laser2 and the cavity. The AOM is locked to this frequency

diﬀerence and its frequency is read using a counter. The exact mode number of the cavity

is determined by measuring the cavity’s free-spectral range using diﬀerent lock points of the

reference laser, as described in Ref. [6]. The mode number and the AOM oﬀset together

yield the frequency of Laser2. A second AOM kept between the reference laser and its

saturated-absorption spectrometer allows us to vary the reference frequency continuously so

that the AOM oﬀset measured for Laser2 is always close to a given value. This eliminates

potential systematic errors due to changes in the direction of the beam entering the cavity.

The error signals needed for locking the diode lasers are produced by modulating the in-

jection current at a frequency of 20–50 kHz. The error signal is obtained from the saturated-

absorption signal by phase-sensitive detection at the third harmonic of the modulation fre-

quency [15]. This produces narrow dispersive signals that are free from eﬀects due to the

underlying Doppler proﬁle or intensity ﬂuctuations. The error signal for locking the cavity

is only a ﬁrst-derivative signal since the cavity modes appear against a ﬂat background.

The spectroscopy on 39K is performed in an ultrahigh vacuum glass cell maintained at a
pressure below 10−8 torr by an ion pump. K vapor is produced by heating a getter source

[16] with a current of 2.6 A. The ultrahigh vacuum environment is necessary to minimize

linewidth broadening arising as a result of background collisions. The getter source also

gives us control over the amount of K vapor in the cell, which we optimized to obtain the

narrowest linewidth.

Fig. 2 shows a typical saturated-absorption spectrum of the D2 line covering the two

ground-hyperﬁne levels. Each peak is actually a convolution of six peaks. However, the

3

individual hyperﬁne transitions are not resolved because the diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels of the

excited state lie within 30 MHz of each other. To determine the line center, we therefore

performed computer simulations of the spectrum. We ﬁrst ﬁxed the locations of the 6 peaks

(with respect to the line center) according to the known hyperﬁne shifts [12]. We then set

the peak amplitudes to correspond to those obtained in saturated-absorption spectroscopy.

We further assumed that the linewidth of all the transitions is the same. We calculated the

spectrum for a given value of the line center and linewidth.

Fig. 3 shows a close-up of the measured spectrum (open circles) for F = 2 → F ′ tran-

sitions. The solid curve is a best ﬁt to the spectrum, obtained with a linewidth of 12.3

MHz. In order to check that this linewidth is reasonable, we tuned the diode laser to the

D1 line of K (at 770 nm), where the individual hyperﬁne transitions are clearly resolved.

The linewidth obtained for those transitions was 14 MHz, close to the ﬁt value for the D2

line. To check the linewidth further, we changed the linewidth for the calculated spectrum

and held it constant during the ﬁtting. The best-ﬁt calculated spectra for a linewidth of 15

MHz is also shown in Fig. 3. Even with this small change, the lineshape deviates from the

measured data. The ﬁt linewidth of 12.3 MHz, however, is larger than the natural linewidth

of 6 MHz. The primary causes for this increase are power broadening due to the pump beam

and a small angle between the counterpropagating pump and probe beams. The eﬀect of

stray magnetic ﬁelds and background collisions is negligible.

With the best ﬁt to the spectrum in Fig. 3, we found that its maximum lies 2.60(10) MHz

above the line center. Similar modelling for transitions starting from the F = 1 ground level

shows that the maximum in the spectrum lies 12.03(10) MHz below the line center.

III. ERROR ANALYSIS

The errors in our frequency measurement technique have been discussed extensively in

earlier publications [2, 6, 7]. We present here a brief overview for the sake of completeness.

There are two classes of potential systematic errors that we consider. The ﬁrst class of

errors comes from systematic shifts in the laser frequencies. For the reference laser, changes

in the lineshape of the peaks due to optical pumping eﬀects are taken care of by carefully

adjusting the pump and probe beam intensities in the saturated-absorption spectrometer (to

a ratio of about 3). Shift in its lock point due to peak pulling from neighboring transitions,

4

the underlying Doppler proﬁle, or phase shifts in the feedback loop are minimized by third-

harmonic detection for the error signal. Collisional shifts in the Rb vapor cell and the eﬀect

of stray magnetic ﬁelds are negligible.

The second class of systematic errors is inherent to our technique because we are really

comparing the wavelength (and not the frequency) of the two lasers. The most important

source of error is dispersion inside the cavity, which is eliminated by using an evacuated

cavity. However, there could be wavelength-dependent phase shifts at the dielectric coated

mirrors used in the cavity. Such errors can be corrected by repeating the measurement at

diﬀerent cavity lengths. We have shown earlier [2] that this error is negligible when the

unknown laser diﬀers from the reference laser by up to 25 nm. In the current work, the

wavelength diﬀerence was only 13 nm, therefore the measurements were done at a single
cavity length of ∼178 mm.

IV. RESULTS

The results of our measurements are listed in Table I. Each value is an average of 50–

100 individual measurements, and the quoted error includes our estimate of the systematic

error. To check for long-term variations, we repeated these measurements over a period of

several weeks. In addition, we used two diﬀerent lock points of the reference laser, namely
the F = 2 → F ′ = (2, 3) transition and the F = 1 → F ′ = (1, 2) transition. The frequencies

for these transitions diﬀer by 6622.886 MHz. The consistency of our values for the two cases

acts as a check on our ability to determine the correct cavity mode number since the cavity

free-spectral range is only about 1.7 GHz. Another check on our results is that the measured
frequencies for the two transitions should diﬀer by the ground hyperﬁne splitting in 39K.

Our value of 461.569(210) MHz overlaps very well with the accepted value of 461.720 MHz

The values in Table I can be combined to yield the hyperﬁne-free frequency of the D2

[12].

391 015 578.040(75) MHz

This value is consistent with the value of 391 015 585(30) MHz from the National Institute of

Standards and Technology energy-level tables [9], but the accuracy is improved by more than

5

two orders of magnitude. The above result can be combined with our earlier measurement

of the D1 line [2] to yield the ﬁne-structure interval in the D line in K

4P3/2 − 4P1/2 :

1 729 997.132(90) MHz

This value overlaps at the 1σ level with our earlier measurement of the ﬁne-structure interval

using a home-built wavemeter [17]: 1 729 993 (5) MHz, but again the accuracy is improved

considerably.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have measured the D2-line frequency and ﬁne-structure interval in 39K

with uncertainty less than 100 kHz. The measurement is complicated by the fact that the

closely-spaced hyperﬁne transitions in the line are not resolved in conventional saturated-

absorption spectroscopy. We use computer simulation of the measured spectrum to ex-

tract the line center. The frequency is measured using a Rb-stabilized ring-cavity resonator

that has general applicability to precise frequency measurement of optical transitions [6].

The only other technique of measuring optical frequencies with comparable precision is the

frequency-comb method [1]. By comparison, our technique is low-cost and easier to imple-

ment.

In the future, we plan to measure the D lines and ﬁne-structure interval of other

alkali atoms such as Li, Na, and Cs. These measurements could play an important role in

QED-independent determinations of the ﬁne-structure constant α.

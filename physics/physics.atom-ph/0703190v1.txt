(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We present an ab initio calculation of small numbers of trapped, strongly interacting fermions
using the Green’s Function Monte Carlo method (GFMC). The ground state energy, density proﬁle
and pairing gap are calculated for particle numbers N = 2 ∼ 22 using the parameter-free “unitary”
interaction. Trial wave functions are taken of the form of correlated pairs in a harmonic oscillator
basis. We ﬁnd that the lowest energies are obtained with a minimum explicit pair correlation
beyond that needed to exploit the degeneracy of oscillator states. We ﬁnd that energies can be
well ﬁtted by the expression aT F ET F + ∆ mod(N, 2) where ET F is the Thomas-Fermi energy of a
noninteracting gas in the trap and ∆ is a pairing gap. There is no evidence of a shell correction
energy in the systematics, but the density distributions show pronounced shell eﬀects. We ﬁnd the
value ∆ = 0.7 ± 0.2ω for the pairing gap. This is smaller than the value found for the uniform gas
at a density corresponding to the central density of the trapped gas.

The physics of cold trapped atoms in quantum conden-
sates has seen remarkable advances on the experimental
front, particularly with the possibility to study pairing
condensates in fermionic systems[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Many
106
features of systems in the size range N
are now well-explored, but the small-N limit is also of
great interest for optical lattices. In this work we investi-
gate the properties of small systems of trapped fermionic
atoms using the Green’s Function Monte Carlo technique
(GFMC) that has been successful in the study of the ho-
mogeneous gas[8]. The small systems are in some ways
more challenging because simpliﬁcations that follow from
translational invariance are not present. Our main goal
here is to see how the bulk behavior evolves as a function
of the number of atoms and to provide benchmark ab ini-
tio results to test other theoretical methods. The Hamil-
tonian for interacting atoms in a spherical harmonic trap
is given by

where ω is the trap frequency and v(r) is the interaction
between the atoms of opposite spin states. We will use
units with ¯h = 1. The interaction is chosen to approach
the so-called unitary limit, meaning that it supports a
two-body bound state at zero energy as well as having a
range much shorter than any other length scales in the
Hamiltonian. For technical reasons, we keep interaction

The eﬀective range of the potential is r0; the short-range

following sections, together with some comparison to the
expectations based on the local density approximation
(LDA).

To apply the GFMC, one starts with a trial wave func-
tion ΨT that is antisymmetrized according to the fermion
statistics of the particles. The GFMC gives the lowest en-
ergy state in the space of wave functions that have the
same nodal structure as ΨT . We tried several approaches
to parameterize ΨT . For even particle number N , they
can all be expressed in the form

with an odd number of particles, we need to include an
unpaired particle in the wave function. We deﬁne an
orbital wave function ψ(r) for the extra particle and it
is included by adding an extra row and column to the
determinant [8, Eq. 14] in the antisymmetrization. We
have mostly investigated trial wave functions where the

(l,
Ansatz Eq.(4) is analogous to the pair wave function used
to calculation the uniform system [8]. There the particle
orbitals were plane waves and each was paired with the
orbital of opposite momentum. This pair state allows
for intra-shell (n = n′) as well as multi-shell (n
= n′)
pairings. At shell closures such as N = 8, 20 the trial
function is equivalent to the Slater determinant of har-
monic oscillator orbitals when the cutoﬀ is at the highest
occupied shell and multi-shell pairings are neglected. We
have also considered taking the pair wave function as the
eigenstate of the two-particle Hamiltonian, requiring in
principle an inﬁnite cutoﬀ in the oscillator representation.
We call this case as 2B.

We carry out the GFMC in the usual way described
in Ref. [9]. The ground state wave function is projected
out of the trial wave function by evolving it in imaginary
time, and the energy is taken by the normalized matrix
element of the Hamiltonian operator. This may be ex-
pressed as

Our target accuracy is 1% on the energies. This is
achieved by taking numerical parameters ∆τ = 0.04ω
and 15, 000 < M < 30, 000. In practice, the convergence
to the ground state is reached in the ﬁrst few thousands
of steps. The Monte Carlo sample points that leave the
> 0 are discarded. This nodal con-
region where
straint avoids the signal decay known as ‘fermion sign
problem’. The energies depend on the range parameter
r0 only in the combination r0√mω which we set to 0.1.
We believe this is small enough to give energies that ap-
proach the contact limit to within 1%. Smaller values of
range parameter are possible but increase the statistical
ﬂuctuations of the Monte Carlo integration.

The cases N = 2, 3 are special in that analytic solu-
tions are known. For the N = 2 system, the Jastrow
correlation factor can be deﬁned to give the exact wave
function and energy E = 2ω. The N = 3 system gives
the ﬁrst real test of the theory. The exact energy is
E = 4.27...ω, given by the solution of a transcendental
equation in one variable[12]. Using Eq. 4 with a single
0.04ω in close
term (Λc = 0) we ﬁnd an energy of 4.28
agreement with the exact value. In contrast, taking the
pair wave function as the two-particle eigenstate gave a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence, 4.41

0.02ω.

We now turn to the larger systems and determine the
parameters in Eq.
4. As mentioned earlier, at the
shell closures taking the cutoﬀ at the highest occupied
shell gives the harmonic oscillator Slater determinant
(HOSD). We also tried Slater determinants for mid-shell
systems, but typically they break rotational symmetry
and give a signiﬁcantly higher energy. Use of Eq. 4 guar-
antees that ΨT will be rotational invariant (for even N ).
One parameterization we explored was to use the results
of Ref.
[8] to guide the choice of Λc and the αΛ. This
gives a rather open trial wave function, having signiﬁ-
cant particle excitation out of the lower shells. Another
choice is to take each αΛ proportional to the shell oc-
cupancy of the HOSD, which we call I1. For mid-shell
systems, this also produces signiﬁcant excitations out of
the nominally closed shells. Both these schemes gave
poorer energies than we could achieve by taking ampli-
tudes αΛ that maximize the occupancy of the ﬁlled shells
of the HOSD, and have no occupancy in the nominally
empty shells. Values of αΛ that approach this compact
limit (CL) are given in Table I. As seen in this table, αΛ
parameters are not very sensitive in the ranges limited
by the shell closures and are kept constant.

For odd N , we take the pair wave function the same
as in the neighboring even system, and the orbital of
the odd particle as an oscillator state of the ﬁlling shell.
Thus, in the range N = 3
7 the orbital is a p-shell
orbital with (n, l) = (0, 1). Starting at Λ = 2 there is a
choice of orbitals, eg. (n, l) = (0, 2) or (1, 0) for N = 9.
We found for the N = 9, 11, 13, 15 and 19 systems, the
energies are degenerate within the statistical errors and
it was not possible to determine the density preference of
the excitation. For these cases, we simply took the odd
orbital to be one with the highest value of l.

The calculated energies are summarized in Table II
for the paired wave function in the compact limit. The
statistical errors of the GFMC are given in parenthesis.
One sees that an accuracy of 1% is achieved with the
numerical procedure we described earlier. In Fig. 1 we
show a plot of the energies including the results from the
HOSD trial wave function. As expected, the energies are
the same at the shell closures but the HOSD gives higher
energies in mid-shell. As an example of the sensitivity
of the energy to the detailed assumption about the pair
state, the results for N = 12 are: ECL = 21.5(3), E2B =
22.3(2) and EI1 = 22.4(3). One sees that the energies
are actually rather close. However, ECL is consistently
2
4% below other pairing node assumptions in the range
of N considered. In case of the simple HOSD, EHOSD =
23.0(1) which is 7% above the CL energy. This gives
some conﬁdence that the assumed nodal structure of ΨT
is adequate for our purposes. We will comment on the

These results show that the pairing is less important
in the trial wave function for the ﬁnite systems than it is
in the uniform gas. While in the homogeneous gas a BCS
treatment of the trial function lowers the energy by more
than 20% (ESF = 0.42EF G and Enormal = 0.56EF G),
the diﬀerence in energy between the both phases of the
trapped gas does not exceed 7% at the most in the open
shell conﬁguration N = 12. At the shell closures, the
BCS treatment does not oﬀer any improvement

totic theory for large nonuniform systems. The ﬁrst term
in the theory is the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation
[14]; the TF approximation to the trapped unitary Fermi
gas is ET F (ξ) = ξ1/2ω(3N )4/3/4, where ξ is the univer-
sal constant relating the energy of the uniform gas to
that of the free Fermi gas. Adding a second term in the
expansion gives a better description of the energy of the
harmonic oscillator energy of the trapped gas in the large
N limit [15]. We therefore will include that in the ﬁt to
the energies, using the form

The result of the ﬁt is shown by the dashed line in Fig.
1. The ﬁt value of ξ is ξ = 0.50. This is somewhat higher
than the bulk value 0.42
0.44. This suggests that the
convergence to the bulk is rather slow. One might expect
to see shell eﬀects in the energies once the smooth trends
have been taken out. The HO energies, for example, os-
cillate around ET F (0) with (negative) peaks at the shell
closures. The eﬀect is visible in the abrupt change of
slop of the HO curve in Fig. 1. However, in our ﬁt to the
calculated energies, we do not see a visible shell closure
eﬀect. In the ﬁt we ﬁnd for the parameter ∆ the value
∆ = 0.6ω, in accordance with the average of the odd-even
staggering of the energy ∆ = 0.7(2)ω. If the pairing gap

We believe our computed energy systematics is reli-
able enough to arrive at the following conclusions. 1)
The energies are signiﬁcantly higher than given by the
TF model with bulk ξ = 42
44. 2) Stabilization of
closed shell systems with respect to open shell ones is
much weaker than in the free gas. However, the den-
sity distribution has pronounced ﬂuctuations similar to
those of the pure harmonic oscillator density. 3) There is
a substantial pairing visible in the odd-even binding en-
ergy diﬀerences, but the magnitude is less than the bulk
pairing parameter associated with a uniform system of
density equal to the central value in the ﬁnite system.

were controlled by the density at the center, it would be
much larger; of the order of shell spacing or higher. On
the other hand, if the odd particle is most sensitive to the
surface region, the pair eﬀect could be smaller. A more
systematic approach to LDA exists where the superﬂuid
correlation is introduced ab initio [16, 17].

We now turn to the density distributions calculated
with the GFMC. We determine the density by binning
the values obtained by the Monte Carlo sampling. With
15000 paths and 1000 samples per path there is ade-
∼
quate statistics to get details of the density distribution
well beyond the mean square radii. Fig. 2 shows the cal-
culated densities for N = 2, 8, 14, and 20. We notice that
the central densities show a pronounced dip for N = 8
and a peak for N = 20. These are characteristic of shell
structure, depending on whether the highest occupied
shell has s-wave orbitals or not. Fig. 2 also shows the
HO density for N = 20. The density of the interacting
system is more compact, as required by its lower energy
and the virial theorem. The central peak has roughly the
same relative shape in the two cases. Thus the basic HO
pattern is maintained, even though the system shrinks in
size.

Let us return again to the problem of the trial func-
tion and its ﬁxed nodal structure.
It is interesting to
ask how diﬀerent are the nodal positions for the diﬀerent
ΨT ’s. We can characterize the trial wave functions by
their relative overlaps of the sign domains. If we deﬁne

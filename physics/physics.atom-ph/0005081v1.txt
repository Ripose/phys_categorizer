Non-adiabatic motion of Bose-Einstein condensates of ru-
bidium atoms arising from the dynamical nature of a time-
orbiting-potential (TOP) trap was observed experimentally.
The orbital micromotion of the condensate in velocity space
at the frequency of the rotating bias ﬁeld of the TOP was de-
tected by a time-of-ﬂight method. A dependence of the equi-
librium position of the atoms on the sense of rotation of the
bias ﬁeld was observed. We have compared our experimental
ﬁndings with numerical simulations. The nonadiabatic fol-
lowing of the atomic spin in the trap rotating magnetic ﬁeld
produces geometric forces acting on the trapped atoms.

Magnetic trapping has become a standard technique
for conﬁning and evaporatively cooling ultra-cold sam-
ples of neutral atoms. Up to now, BEC in alkali atoms
has been achieved in two diﬀerent kinds of magnetic
traps: static traps, and dynamic ones, also called time-
orbiting-potential (TOP) traps [1]. In the latter, intro-
duced in [2], a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld is modiﬁed
by a rotating homogeneous bias ﬁeld which causes the
quadrupole ﬁeld to orbit around the origin, thus elimi-
nating the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld at the trap center.
In the original scheme with cylindrical symmetry [2], the
bias ﬁeld rotates in the symmetry plane of the quadrupole
ﬁeld, whereas in a later version [3] the plane of rotation
contains the quadrupole symmetry axis, which yields a
completely asymmetric (triaxial) magnetic trap. In the
present work, precise measurements on the motion of a
87Rb condensate in the triaxial TOP trap have allowed us
to discover new dynamical features, beyond the approx-
imations previously applied in the theoretical treatment
of time-dependent magnetic traps.

In the adiabatic approximation the spins of the mag-
netically trapped atoms follow the instantaneous direc-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld. Generally speaking, an adia-
batic approximation is applied when the evolution of one
set of variables of a system is fast compared to the time
scale of a second one. While the full dynamics can be
quite complicated and hard to analyze, in a useful ap-
proximation the fast motion is solved for ﬁxed values of
the slow coordinates, and then the slow dynamics is con-
sidered to be governed by the average values of the fast
motion. In a classical description, the energy of the fast
motion calculated for ﬁxed values of the variables of the
slow system acts as a potential in which the evolution
of the slow system takes place. In an improved approxi-

[4].

mation, reaction forces act on the slow dynamics. They
are related to the geometric phase and to the geomet-
ric gauge ﬁelds
In the classical case, the physical
origin of the geometric forces has been studied, e.g., for
atomic systems with spins [5]. For atomic motion in an
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, the slow atomic external
degree of freedom acts as a “guiding center” for the evo-
lution of the fast precessing spin variables coupled to the
magnetic ﬁeld. The resulting geometric forces are usu-
ally very small and hard to detect. Analogous terms in
the calculation of molecular spectra beyond the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation do, however, lead to mea-
surable shifts of energy levels, underlining the usefulness
of the concept [4].

In the TOP trap, the guiding-center atomic motion
within the time-dependent inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
acquires an additional dynamic feature associated with
the periodic evolution of the rotating ﬁeld, feature not
present in the analyses of [5]. Because the frequency of
the bias ﬁeld rotation is typically much larger than the
vibrational frequencies of the atoms in the trap, in an
additional approximation a time-average over the period
of the rotating ﬁeld is usually performed. Application of
both adiabatic and time-average approximations predicts
a description of the atomic motion in terms of a time-
independent potential. A number of theoretical studies
have considered the role of the nonadiabatic dynamics [6]
or of the time-dependent potential on the atomic evolu-
tion in a TOP trap [7]. Experimental investigations, how-
ever, have restricted their attention mainly to the atomic
response to the time-independent adiabatic potential.

The breakdown of the time-average approximation and
of the adiabatic spin following approximation, and the
evidence for additional geometric forces are visible in the
following measurements on a 87Rb condensate [8] in a
triaxial trap: i) the atomic micromotion at the frequency
of the bias ﬁeld, ii) the change of the atomic equilibrium
position in the trap when inverting the sense of rotation
of the bias ﬁeld [9], iii) the dependence of the rotation-
sensitive equilibrium position on the applied magnetic
ﬁelds. The dependence of the equilibrium position on the
sense of rotation of the bias ﬁeld does not violate any fun-
damental symmetry law, as the handedness of the Lar-
mor precession for an atom in a trapped state deﬁnes the
sense of rotation in the atomic evolution. In our experi-
mental investigation,as for other TOP traps, the typical
conditions for applying the adiabatic and time-averaged
approximations are not violated [11]. A precise detec-
tion of the micromotion, however, allowed us to perform

1

measurements of the non-adiabatic eﬀects present in the
TOP trap. We have compared our results with analytical
models and numerical simulations based on a completely
classical description, obtaining good agreement.

Our experimental apparatus [12] is based on a double-
MOT system with two cells connected by a glass tube to
capture, cool and transfer atoms into a magnetic TOP
trap. The latter consists of a pair of quadrupole coils
oriented along a horizontal axis and two pairs of bias-
ﬁeld coils, one incorporated into the quadrupole coils and
the other along a horizontal axis perpendicular to that of
the quadrupole coils, as shown in Fig. 1. After transfer-
ring the atoms into the TOP-trap, we evaporatively cool
them ﬁrst by reducing the radius of the quadrupole orbit
and ﬁnally by applying an RF-ﬁeld. Once Bose-Einstein
condensation has occurred in the |F = 2, mF = 2i state,
we adiabatically changed the quadrupole gradient and
the bias ﬁeld to the desired values. The instantaneous
magnetic ﬁeld seen by the atoms is:
B = (cid:2)2b′x + B0 cos ω0t(cid:3)ˆi + (cid:2)−b′y + B0 sin ω0t(cid:3)ˆj − b′zˆk (1)
where b′ is the quadrupole gradient along the z-axis, and
B0 and ω0 are the magnitude and the frequency of the
bias ﬁeld, respectively.

FIG. 1. Schematic of the static and rotating magnetic ﬁelds
conﬁning the condensate, and of the shadow-imaging method.
Imaging along the y-axis allowed us to measure the velocity
of the atoms along the x and z axes. For our trap parameters
the spatial amplitude of the micromotion in the trap was less
than 1 µm, well below our resolution limit of 5 µm.

Application of the adiabatic and time-average approx-
imations leads to an oscillatory motion of the atoms in a
time-independent potential with a harmonic frequencies
ωx : ωy : ωz of 2 : 1 : √2, where ωx = b′p2µ/mB0,
m being the mass and µ the magnetic moment of an
atom in the trapped state [3]. Lifting the time-average
approximation yields the atomic micromotion, because

2

the atoms experience a time-dependent potential at fre-
quency ω0 and its harmonics. Expansion of the potential
energy U for atoms close to the trap center gives addi-
tional linear terms ∆U modulated at the frequency ω0
on top of the eﬀective harmonic potential, with

∆U = µb′ (2x cos ω0t − y sin ω0t) .

at ω0 = 2π × 104 s−1 in (a) and on ω0 in (b).
In (b), b′
=329 Gcm−1 and B0 =28 G. In (a), for gradients larger than
200 Gcm−1, B0 = 28 G was used, whereas for smaller gradi-
ents B0 was reduced in order to maintain a small gravitational
sag. Continuous lines from Eqs. (3). The inset in (a) shows
the velocity dependence on the phase of the bias ﬁeld at which
the trap was switched oﬀ (zero phase corresponds to the bias
ﬁeld pointing along the direction of observation).

For trap oscillation frequencies well below ω0, separa-
tion of the time scales allows us to write down the atomic
micromotion at ω0 as a small shaking motion on top of
the secular motion in the trap. Balancing the restoring
force from the ∆U potential with the centrifugal force of
the resulting orbital motion yields a periodic micromo-
tion with velocity amplitudes

In order to observe the micromotion of the atoms at the
TOP-frequency, the trap ﬁelds were switched oﬀ in a time
(less than 20 µs) short compared to the period of the
TOP-ﬁeld [13]. The instant at which the trapping ﬁelds
were switched oﬀ was determined to better than 1% of
a TOP-cycle. After switching oﬀ the quadrupole ﬁeld at

a well-deﬁned phase of the rotating bias ﬁeld and after
a variable delay of up to 8 ms, we imaged the absorption
shadow of the falling cloud onto a CCD-chip. Because
of the small spatial amplitude of the micromotion, the
measured position of the atoms along the x-axis after
the time-of-ﬂight was determined solely by their initial
velocity v0x in that direction (see Fig. 1).

A typical plot of v0x as a function of the bias-ﬁeld phase
is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. A velocity amplitude
of 5 mm s−1 corresponds to a spatial amplitude of the
micromotion around 100 nm. Also shown in Fig. 2 is
the dependence of v0x on the quadrupole gradient and
on the frequency of the rotating bias ﬁeld. We found
no dependence of v0x on B0. All of these dependencies
are in agreement with Eq. (3)(continuous lines in Fig. 2).
We checked by numerical integration of the equations
of motion in the adiabatic approximation that the ﬁnite
switching time of the trapping ﬁeld leads to a reduction
of the measured micromotion velocity of at most a few
percent compared to Eq. 3.

FIG. 3. Centre-of-mass oscillations of atoms

in the
TOP-trap for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the
bias ﬁeld. The gradient b′ and the bias ﬁeld B0 were 20.8
Gcm−1 and 4 G, respectively. The equilibrium positions for
the two cases are indicated by the horizontal lines.

When the sense of rotation of the bias ﬁeld was re-
versed, the phase of the measured velocity was shifted
by 180 degrees, in accordance with the physical picture
of the atoms being ‘dragged’ along by the instantaneous
position of the quadrupole center. On top of this phase
shift, we observed a shift in the vertical equilibrium po-
sition of the atoms in the TOP-trap. We achieved a high
resolution of the equilibrium position by using very small
condensate clouds and by exciting dipole oscillations of
the cloud along the z-axis. Typical results of such mea-
surements for the two senses of rotation of the bias ﬁeld
are shown in Fig. 3. Fitting a sinusoidal curve to the
position data we determined the absolute centre of the
oscillations to within 5 µm and the relative position of
the centers to within 3 µm. Identical conditions for both
senses of rotation were ensured by powering the bias coils

from two phase-locked signal generators and shifting their
relative phase by 180 degrees to reverse the sense of ro-
tation whilst keeping all other parameters constant.

FIG. 4. (a) shows the dependence on the quadrupole gradi-
ent b′ of the splitting ∆zeq of the equilibrium positions (ﬁlled
symbols) for opposite senses of rotation of the bias ﬁeld, and
dependence of the oscillation frequencies (open symbols). The
solid and dotted lines are the results of a numerical simula-
tion without the adiabatic approximation. The dashed line is
the prediction of Eq.4; B0 = 4 G for all points. In (b) we plot
the dependence of the splitting (symbols: data, solid line: nu-
merical simulation) on the inverse of the bias ﬁeld strength
for ﬁxed gradient (b′ = 20 Gcm−1).

The measured dependence of the spatial separation
∆zeq of the two equilibrium positions on the inverse of
the quadrupole gradient, 1/b′, is shown in Fig. 4 (a). For
large gradients, we ﬁnd a linear dependence of ∆zeq on
1/b′, whereas for the smallest gradients the splitting data
deviate signiﬁcantly from a straight line as b′ approaches
min = 15.3 Gcm−1, necessary to
the minimum gradient, b′
balance gravity. In Fig. 4 (b) the measured dependence
of ∆zeq on the inverse of the bias-ﬁeld B0 is shown. Also
plotted in Fig. 4 (a) is the dependence of ωz on 1/b′, al-
lowing a calibration of b′ with an accuracy of two percent
over a very large range.

We have solved numerically the coupled diﬀerential
equations of [10] for the center of mass motion and atomic
spin within our TOP trap ﬁeld. The numerical simula-
tions provided an excellent ﬁt for the results of Fig. 4
[14]. To ﬁnd the equilibrium position, a transient damp-
ing was introduced in the numerical integration of the
evolutions for the center-of-mass and/or the spin. We

3

have veriﬁed that damping rates corresponding to the
trap lifetime do not modify the atomic micromotion and
the non-adiabatic eﬀects. However the role of additional
damping mechanisms, for instance the viscous heating
of [2], should be tested.

To interpret the dependence of the splitting ∆zeq on
the ﬁeld gradient, a transformation to a frame rotat-
ing synchronously with the bias ﬁeld may be applied,
as in [9,10]. For the special case of a cylindrical TOP
trap this transformation completely removes the time de-
pendence. The frame rotation acting on the spin vari-
ables introduces a ﬁctitious (geometric) magnetic ﬁeld
Bg = −mF¯hω0 ˆk/µ along the rotation axis, with mF¯h
the atomic internal angular momentum. In a reﬁned adi-
abatic approximation the spin is aligned with the eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld, i.e. the sum of the real and geometric magnetic
ﬁelds. The occurrence of transverse components of the
the spin with respect to the real magnetic ﬁeld lies at the
heart of the concept of geometric forces. The geometric
ﬁeld shifts vertically the plane of the quadrupole orbit.
The diﬀerence ∆zeq in the equilibrium positions for cw
and ccw rotations of the bias ﬁeld is

Gravity shifts the equilibrium position zeq downwards,
but for a cylindrical trap the above result for ∆zeq is not
modiﬁed. The expressions for the geometric force of [5]
give rise to an equivalent result for the geometric ﬁeld
and the splitting ∆zeq. While for the cylindrical TOP
trap the transformation to the rotating frame takes care
completely of the spin dynamics, for the triaxial TOP
trap the rotating frame transformation does not result in
In fact, at low b′ values,
a time-independent problem.
approaching b′
min, the splitting data of Fig. 4(a) deviate
from the behavior described by Eq. (4). Higher order
geometric terms derived in [5] lead to corrections several
orders of magnitude too small to explain these deviations.
Numerically we found that at zero gravity also for the
triaxial TOP trap ∆zeq is well described by Eq.
(4).
This leads us to conjecture that gravity modiﬁes the fast
correlation between spin orientation and center-of-mass
motion responsible for the geometric forces.

In summary, in a TOP trap the micromotion and the
splitting of the equilibrium positions of the atoms for op-
positely rotating bias ﬁelds are accounted for by a lifting
of the time-average and adiabatic approximations. The
dependence of the splitting on the magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient arises from the nonadiabatic characteristics of the
TOP trap. The micromotion in a TOP-trap is of rele-
vance for experiments where an accurate control of the
condensate residual motion on the recoil velocity scale
(5 mm s−1) is required, e.g. in atom lasers or condensate
transfer. The observed dependence of the equilibrium
position on the bias ﬁeld rotation hopefully motivates
theoretical eﬀorts to calculate higher order corrections to

4

the adiabatic spin evolution in the TOP-trap conﬁgura-
tion. Finally it should be tested, theoretically and exper-
imentally, whether the condensate response to the par-
allel transport of the atomic spin in a TOP trap, which
gives rise to the geometric forces, may inﬂuence also the
internal dynamics of the condensate.

[13] The switch-oﬀ time of the bias ﬁeld, limited by the qual-
ity factor of tank circuits was around 150 µs. However,
fast switching of the bias ﬁeld was not required as the
atoms are no longer trapped once the quadrupole ﬁeld is
extinguished.

[14] We should mention that the agreement between simula-
tions and experiments becomes less satisfactory for very
elliptical bias ﬁeld in the x − y plane.

A systematic QED treatment of electron correlation is presented for ions along the lithium isoelectronic se-
quence. We start with the zeroth-order approximation that accounts for a part of the electron-electron interaction
by a local model potential introduced into the Dirac equation. The residual electron correlation is treated by per-
turbation theory. Rigorous QED evaluation is presented for the ﬁrst two terms of the perturbative expansion; the
third-order contribution is calculated within the many-body perturbation theory. We report accurate numerical
results for the electronic-structure part of the ionization potential for the n = 2 states of all Li-like ions up to
uranium.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Li-like ions are among the most fundamental many-electron
systems. Excellent experimental accuracy achieved for these
ions and their relative simplicity make them a very attrac-
tive object for an ab initio theoretical description. Numer-
ous measurements were performed for the Lamb shift for ions
along the lithium isoelectronic sequence; some recent ones
were presented in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Large theoret-
ical effort was invested during the last decade into rigorous
calculations of QED effects for the 2pJ -2s transition energies
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], which resulted in a sub-
stantial improvement of the description of these transitions.
However, the accuracy achieved in theoretical investigations
remained in most cases lower than that of the best experi-
mental results. Its further improvement is important since a
comparison of theoretical and experimental results on a bet-
ter level of accuracy will provide a test of QED effects up to
second order in the ﬁne structure constant.

In the present investigation, we restrict ourself to an ab
initio description of the electronic-structure part of the ener-
gies of the n = 2 states of Li-like ions. By the electronic-
structure part we understand the contributions that are induced
by Feynman diagrams involving only the electron-electron in-
teraction (thus excluding the diagrams of the self-energy and
vacuum-polarization type) taken in the limit of the inﬁnitely
heavy nucleus. The electronic-structure effects correspond
to a well-deﬁned and gauge-invariant part of the energy and
thus can be addressed separately.
In order to obtain accu-
rate theoretical predictions for the energy levels, other effects
should be added to the electronic-structure part, which com-
prise the one-loop self-energy and vacuum-polarization (see,
e.g., the review [18]), the screening of one-loop self-energy
and vacuum-polarization [9, 10, 16], the two-loop QED ef-
fects [17], and the relativistic recoil effect [19, 20].

Within QED, a single electron-electron interaction is rep-
resented as an exchange of a virtual photon and is given (in
relativistic units ~ = c = 1) by the operator

I(ω) = e2 αµ

where Dµν is the photon propagator, whose expression in the

and αµ = (1, α) are the

The traditional approach to the treatment of the electron
correlation (beyond the lowest-order case of the one-photon
exchange, which is rather simple) is based on a simpliﬁed
form of the interaction obtained within the Breit approxima-
tion. It is achieved by taking the small-ω limit of the operator
I(ω) while working in the Coulomb gauge (i.e., neglecting the
retardation of the photon). We will indicate the Breit approxi-
mation employed for the operator I(ω) simply by omitting the
energy argument, I(ω)
I. The corresponding expression
consists of two parts, referred to as the Coulomb and the Breit
interaction,

The basic traditional methods for the relativistic structure
calculations are the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)
applied to the lithium isoelectronic sequence by Johnson et
[21], the multiconﬁgurational Dirac-Fock method ap-
al.
plied by Indelicato and Desclaux [22], and the conﬁguration-
interaction method applied to Li-like ions by Chen et al. [23].
All these methods treat the one-photon exchange correction
exactly and the higher-order electron correlation, within the
Breit approximation only. They are thus incomplete to the
order α2(Zα)3m, which is the leading order for the two-
electron QED effects. Rigorous QED calculations of the two-
photon exchange correction were performed for n = 2 states

of Li-like ions in Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. An exchange of
three and more more virtual photons can presently be treated
within the Breit approximation only, which leads to an incom-
pleteness at the nominal order α3(Zα)2m.

The three-photon exchange correction can be either calcu-
lated directly, as a quantum mechanical third-order perturba-
tion correction with the same starting potential as in QED
calculations, or inferred from the total energies obtained in
relativistic-structure calculations, by subtracting the zeroth-
, ﬁrst-, and second-order perturbation terms evaluated sepa-
rately. Care should be taken in the latter case since the sub-
traction procedure involves large numerical cancellations.

Calculations of the three-photon exchange correction for
Li-like ions were performed previously in Refs. [14, 24]. They
were carried out on the Coulomb wave functions and the re-
sults can be directly added to the existing values for the two-
electron QED effects. Another approach to this problem is ad-
vocated by Sapirstein and Cheng [13] and consists in starting
the perturbative expansion with a local model potential, which
incorporates a part of the electron-electron interaction effects.
By a proper choice of the model potential, one can signiﬁ-
cantly accelerate the convergence of the perturbative expan-
sion. In Ref. [13], this approach was applied to the case of Li-
like bismuth and the results are in good agreement with those
obtained with the Coulomb wave functions [11, 12]. Advan-
tages of this approach should become more evident for the
smaller values of Z, where the convergence of the perturba-
tive expansion becomes slower.

In the present

the method of
investigation, we adopt
Ref. [13] and apply it to the study of the electronic-structure
effects for ions along the isoelectronic sequence of lithium.
The approach can be regarded as a successor of the MBPT
treatment applied to Li-like ions by Johnson et al. [21]; the
difference is that we perform a rigorous QED evaluation of
the second-order correction and employ a different potential
for the zeroth-order approximation.

The paper is organized as follows. The choice of different
model potentials to be used for the zeroth-order approxima-
tion are discussed in the next section.
In Sec. III, the per-
turbative expansion for the electron-correlation effects is con-
structed within the MBPT approximation. We present results
of numerical calculations for different model potentials in the
case of lithium and compare the convergence of the result-
ing expansions. The rigorous QED calculation of the electron
correlation through the second order of perturbation theory is
presented in Sec. IV. We combine the QED values for the
two-photon exchange correction with the MBPT results from
the previous section to obtain the electronic-structure part of
the ionization potential for the n = 2 states of atoms along
the lithium isoelectronic sequence. In the last section, we col-
lect all theoretical contributions available for the 2p1/2-2s and
2p3/2-2s transition energies of several Li-like ions, compare
them with experimental results, and discuss perspectives for
further improvement of theoretical predictions.

II. CHOICE OF POTENTIAL

We consider here three local model potentials that are sup-
posed to account for a part of the interaction between the va-
lence electron and the closed core. The simplest choice is the
core-Hartree (CH) potential deﬁned as

VCH(r) = Vnuc(r) + α

ρs.c.
c

(r′) ,

(6)

∞

dr′ 1
r>

Z

where Vnuc(r) denotes the nuclear potential (i.e., the Coulomb
potential induced by an extended nuclear-charge distribution),
r> = max(r, r′), ρc is the density of the core electrons,

ρc(r) =

(2jc + 1)

Xnc

c (r) + F 2

G2
(cid:2)

,

c (r)
(cid:3)

(7)

the superscript “s.c.” indicates that the density has to be calcu-
lated self-consistently, jc and nc are the angular-moment and
the principal quantum number of the core electrons, and Gc
and Fc are the upper and the lower radial components of the
wave function. The CH potential plays a special role for alka-
line ions since a well-deﬁned part of the screening effects can
be accounted for by perturbing the ﬁrst-order QED corrections
with this potential (see, e.g., Ref. [8]). Owing to this property,
the CH potential was frequently employed for an approximate
treatment of the screening of QED effects [8, 13, 25]; a similar
potential (without self-consistency) was used in Refs. [26, 27].
The second model potential is based on results of the
density-functional theory (DFT) and referred to as the Kohn-
Sham (KS) potential. The local potential derived from DFT is
given by [28, 29, 30]

By a proper choice of the weights wκ,n, the density ρv can be

admixture of the core density should be small in order not to
disturb the potential outside of the vicinity of the nodes. We
achieve this by choosing the weights to be dependent on r,

The third model potential is obtained from the numerical
solutions of the standard Dirac-Fock (DF) problem; it is re-
ferred to as the local Dirac-Fock (LDF) potential. The scheme
for construction of this potential was developed previously in
Refs. [32, 33]. For completeness, we reproduce it here, indi-
cating some modiﬁcations introduced in this work.

The solution of the radial DF equations for the valence state
v (achieved in this work with help of the GRASP package
[34]) provides us with the eigenvalue εDF
and the upper and
and F DF
the lower radial components denoted by GDF
, re-
spectively. Let us now imagine that they are the eigenvalue
and the solutions of the radial Dirac equations with a local
potential Vv,

to solve this problem approximately. For the states v with the
wave function without nodes [in our case, such are the 2p1/2
and 2p3/2 states], we obtain our local potential by multiply-
ing Eqs. (12) and (13) by GDF
, respectively, adding
them together, and then inverting the equation with respect to
Vv. The resulting potential is

It is of interest to compare the radial dependence of differ-
ent screening potentials deﬁned above. In Fig. 1, we present
such comparison for the (1s)2 2s and (1s)2 2p1/2 states of
lithium, expressing the potentials in terms the effective nu-

where v is the valence state with nr = 0. In the case when
the valence wave function has nodes (nr > 0), the potential

at the nodes of the upper component, making the potential to
be nearly singular at these points.

the second and higher orders of perturbation theory, it should
be taken into account that a summation over the negative-
energy part of the Dirac spectrum may lead to large spuri-
ous effects [35]. Consistent treatment of the negative-energy
states in such situations can be performed only within QED
and the common approach is to restrict the summations to the
positive-energy part of the Dirac spectrum only.

General formulas for the MBPT corrections to the energy
for systems with a single electron outside a closed core are
known and can be found in Ref. [36]. It is our intention, how-
ever, to obtain a different representation for them in order to
make explicit connections with the corresponding formulas in
full QED.

As the zeroth-order approximation, we take the eigenval-
ues and the solutions of the Dirac equation with the effective
potential Veﬀ (r) = Vnuc(r) + U (r), where U (r) is the model
potential that accounts for a part of the electron-electron inter-
action. Since we intend to incorporate the MBPT results into
ab initio QED calculations, the model potential U should be a
local one, thus excluding the possibility to use the Dirac-Fock
potential, which is the standard choice in traditional many-
body calculations.

In the following, we assume the electron conﬁguration to
be of the form (1s)2 v, where v is the valence electron and
1s is a core electron (also denoted by c in formulas below).
The contributions due to the core-core interaction will be ex-
cluded from consideration as they do not inﬂuence transition
energies; corrections obtained in this way can be identiﬁed as
contributions to the ionization energy of the valence electron.

The zeroth-order energy E(0) is deﬁned as

E(0) = εv −
where εv is the Dirac eigenvalue corresponding to the valence
state v. Corrections to the lowest-order energy are treated by

(20)

m ,

perturbation theory. Since the model potential U is included
into the zeroth-order approximation, we have to account for
the “residual” interaction (
U ) in each order of perturba-
tion theory and the perturbative expansion goes both in the
U ) (see Ref. [37] for
electron-electron interaction and in (
details).

We will denote corrections to the energy by ∆E(i,j|k),
where the index i indocates the order of the correction with
respect to the electron-electron interaction, j denotes the or-
der in U , and k = i+j is the total order of perturbation theory.
The following shorthand notations will be used throughout the
paper: Iabcd =

wave function. The ﬁrst two corrections are

where the prime on a sum denotes that the terms with the van-

to keep the summation over the complete Dirac spectrum in
the above corrections to the wave functions, not excluding the
negative-energy states as is customary in MBPT calculations.
Similar conclusion was previously drawn in Ref. [38], where
it was demonstrated that inclusion of some negative-energy
states drastically reduces the potential dependence of MBPT
results for He-like ions.

The expressions for the second- and third-order corrections presented above contain products of the operators I and, therefore,
include the Breit interaction to the second and even to the third order. Keeping the Breit interaction to the second order produces
contributions of the same order as QED effects omitted [for the two-photon exchange, the order is α2(Zα)3] and thus cannot be
regarded as ultimately wrong. However, this contribution can be shown to originate from the region of virtual excitation energies
of order of the electron mass, where the Breit approximation is no longer valid. We thus consider it to be more correct to treat
the Breit interaction as a ﬁrst-order perturbation only. In our actual calculations, we expand each I into a sum of the Coulomb
and Breit parts and keep terms with the Breit interaction up to the ﬁrst order only.

The MBPT results (37)-(39) can easily be improved by accounting for the one-photon exchange correction rigorously, using
the exact expression for the operator of the electron-electron interaction (1). In this case, approximate formulas (23), (30), and
(31) should be replaced by the exact ones

Now we have the exact expression for the ﬁrst-order correc-
tion ∆E(1), whereas the second-order correction still contains
the two-photon exchange part calculated within the MBPT ap-
proximation only. The rigorous QED treatment of the cor-
rection ∆E(2,0|2) will be presented in the next section. The
three-photon exchange contribution is more difﬁcult to eval-
uate rigorously; presently it can be addressed to only within
MBPT or other methods based on the Breit approximation.

We now discuss some details of our numerical evaluation
of the MBPT corrections. The complete set of Dirac eigen-
states for a given local potential Veﬀ (r) is generated by means
of the dual-kinetic-balance basis-set method [39] with basis
functions constructed from B splines. The computationally
most intensive part of the calculation is the third-order cor-
rection ∆E(3,0|3)
MBPT, particularly the ﬁrst term in Eq. (25) that
involves a quadruple sum over intermediate states. The sum-
mation over magnetic substates was performed numerically
for each coupling by summing combinations of the Clebsch-
Gordan coefﬁcients. It is possible to derive closed expressions
for such sums (as was done for the third-order Coulomb ex-
change in Ref. [21]). However, since it does not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the performance of our code, we prefer to do this
summation numerically.

The main problem with the evaluation of the ﬁrst term in
Eq. (25) is that it involves two independent (and unrestricted)
partial-wave summations over the Dirac angular momentum
of intermediate states, which we denote as κ1 and κ2. Two
other summations (over κ3 and κ4) become ﬁnite after taking
into account selection rules of the Racah algebra. Our ap-
proach to the evaluation of the double partial-wave expansion
over κ1 and κ2 is similar to the one used in the previous cal-
culation of the two-loop self-energy correction [40, 41]. First,
we construct a matrix of elements with ﬁxed values of
and
= 1, . . .. Then, we ex-
= 1, . . . and

|
trapolate to inﬁnity the partial sums along the diagonals of the
matrix X|κ1|,|κ2|, taking typically of about 5 terms for each

: X|κ1|,|κ2|,

diagonal. Finally, we extrapolate to inﬁnity the sequence of
the sums of ith subdiagonals of the matrix, taking typically of
about 7 terms. Signiﬁcant numerical cancellations should be
mentioned that arise in our numerical evaluation of the third-
order correction in the low-Z region. This leads to necessity
to employ a sufﬁciently large basis set in order to achieve a
proper convergence. In actual calculations, we used a basis
set with the number of positive-energy states varying from 50
in the low-Z region to 40 in the high-Z region.

An important question that arises in actual calculations is
how one should interpret the condition of the vanishing of the
denominator, which is used in order to exclude terms from the
summation in Eqs. (24) etc. and to deﬁne the case in Eqs. (26)
and (36). The point is that, for v = 2pJ, an intermediate
state with the same orbital momentum l, namely 2pJ ′, appears
in the Dirac spectrum, whose energy is separated from εv by
(Zα)2. As a
relativistic effects only, δ = ε2p3/2 −
result, very small energy denominators of order δ2 may appear
in the expressions for the third-order energy, which would lead
to huge numerical cancellations in the low-Z region.

ε2p1/2 ∝

The appearance of small denominators can be avoided if
we take into account that there could be no contributions to
the energy of the state (1s)22pJ arising from the intermediate
3-electron state (1s)22pJ ′ with a different total momentum
J ′. This means that the total contribution of such intermedi-
ate states is zero, although the corresponding terms can arise
at intermediate stages of the calculation. We have veriﬁed this
statement numerically, which served as an additional cross-
check of our numerical routine.
In the actual calculations,
we deﬁne the energy denominator as vanishing if its absolute
value is smaller than the ﬁne-structure difference δ. This re-
deﬁnition greatly facilitates the numerical evaluation of the
third-order correction in the low-Z region.

Let us now address the following questions: (i) what is
the best local potential to use for the perturbative expansion
and (ii) how to estimate the residual electron-correlation ef-
fects? In order to answer these questions, we turn to the most
difﬁcult Li-like atom to describe within MBPT, to neutral
lithium. For higher-Z systems, the relative weight of the elec-
tron correlation with respect to the binding energy gradually
decreases, so one should expect that the perturbation expan-
sion converges faster. If we use the pure Coulomb potential
in the zeroth-order approximation, the perturbative-expansion
parameter is just 1/Z. It is no longer so for other potentials,
but the general tendency remains. Obviously, MBPT is not
the best approach to use for very low-Z systems. Extremely
accurate results are nowadays available for lithium; they can
be used as a benchmark to estimate the residual correlation

effects in our calculations. The best results for lithium are ob-
tained within the method that starts with a variational solution
of the three-body Schr¨odinger problem with a fully correlated
basis set and then adds relativistic and QED corrections term
by term as obtained within the Zα expansion [42, 43].

Our numerical results for the ionization energy of the n = 2
states of lithium are presented in Table I for four potentials:
the pure Coulomb (Coul), the core-Hartree, the Kohn-Sham,
and the local Dirac-Fock potentials. The entry labeled “Dirac”
contains the zeroth-order energies E(0); the next 3 lines con-
tain the corrections given by Eqs. (43)-(45), respectively. The
“exact” results represent the sum of the nonrelativistic energy
and the Breit correction in the inﬁnitely-heavy-nucleus limit;
they are taken from Ref. [42].

It is not at all unexpected that for lithium, the perturba-
tion theory starting with the Coulomb potential yields a very
slowly converging series and that the results do not reproduce
well the “exact” relativistic energies. It is perhaps more sur-
prising that the CH potential, which gives a reasonable value
for the zeroth-order energy, does not nevertheless yield a well-
converging perturbative expansion. We have to conclude that
the residual interaction is not small enough in this case. Al-
though the CH perturbative expansion becomes converging
for higher values of Z, this choice of the model potential does
not look favorable when compared with the other potentials,
the KS and the LDF one.

We observe that the LDF potential is clearly the best choice
among the cases studied. It will be employed for our further
calculations in this work. The residual electron correlation
can be estimated by taking the difference of the KS and LDF
results. Table I shows that such difference yields a conserva-
tive estimate in the case of 2pJ states, whereas for the 2s state

it is only just consistent with the deviation of the LDF value
from the exact result. We found that the choice of the param-
eter xα = 1/2 in the deﬁnition of the KS potential [Eq. (10)]
yields a more conservative estimate for the 2s state. The resid-
ual electron correlation was thus estimated as a difference of
the LDF and KS results with the parameter xα = 1/2 for the
2s state and xα = 2/3 for the 2pJ states. The estimate ob-
tained in this way decreases roughly as Z −2 with increase of
10−6 a.u.)
Z and becomes entirely negligible (i.e., less than 5
for Z > 21 for 2s state and Z > 30 for 2pJ states. It can
be mentioned that a small potential dependence of the MBPT
results appears again for large values of Z and is due to an
incomplete treatment of the negative-energy part of the Dirac
spectrum.

It is of interest to compare results of different calculations
for lithium isoelectronic sequence in the low-Z region, where
QED effects are small and do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
comparison. In Figs. 2 and 3, we plot the absolute values of
the difference of our MBPT values and the results of other
calculations [21, 44, 45, 46, 47] for the ionization energy of
the 2s state and for the centroid of the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 lev-
els, respectively. Calculations by Chung [45, 46, 47] were
carried out on nonrelativistic wave functions, ﬁrst solving the
Schr¨odinger equation and then adding the expectation value
of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. Relativistic calculations by
Blundell et al. [44] were performed within a combination of
the coupled-cluster formalism and MBPT. They yielded rather
accurate (by standards of MBPT) results but were carried out
for lithium and beryllium only. The evaluation by Johnson et
al. [21] is a third-order MBPT calculation that stands most
close to our treatment presented so far.
In order to make
a comparison with the results of other calculations, we sub-
tracted the contribution of the mass-polarization operator H4

Chung are from [47].

from the relativistic results of Refs. [45, 46, 47] and the nu-
clear recoil correction from those of Refs. [21, 44].

We would like now to outline several differences between
our present MBPT treatment and the one of Ref. [21]. First,
we use a different starting point for the perturbative expansion
(the LDF potential instead of the nonlocal DF potential). Sec-
ond, we include the Breit part of the third-order energy cor-
rection. This is an important issue since, as previously noted
in Ref. [24], the third-order Coulomb contribution happens to
be anomalously small, so that the corresponding Breit correc-
tion is comparable with the Coulomb one even for low-Z sys-
tems and becomes dominant in the high-Z region. Third, we
include the negative-energy contribution for the corrections to
the wave functions by summing over the complete Dirac spec-
turm in Eqs. (21) and (22). Fourth, we employ a much larger
basis set than the one consisting of 20 positive-energy func-
tions reported in Ref. [21]. This becomes important for small
values of Z, where signiﬁcant numerical cancellations occur
in our calculations of third-order energies.

For the 2s state, we observe good agreement with Chung’s
values for the lowest-Z ions and a rapidly increasing devia-
tion for higher-Z ions. The discrepancy is mainly due to his
neglect of terms beyond the relative order (Zα)2 in the one-
electron energies and in the one-photon exchange correction,
which are included to all orders in relativistic calculations. In-
deed, the leading correction beyond the Breit approximation
can be written within the 1/Z expansion as

δE(Z) = (Zα)6 a60 + α(Zα)5 a51 + O[α2(Zα)3] ,

(46)

where the coefﬁcient a60 originates from the expansion of
the Dirac energy, a60(2s) =
21/1024, and a51 comes
from the one-photon exchange correction, a51(2s) = 0.1175
[48]. Resulting contribution for, e.g., Z = 20 is δE(20) =
0.00266 a.u., which can be compared with the actual de-
−
viation of our result from the Chung’s one of
0.00275 a.u.
The corresponding correction to the centroid of the 2p lev-
10−6 a.u.),
els is much smaller (for Z = 10, it is about 1

which explains much better agreement with Chung’s results
observed in Fig. 3.

The comparison with other calculations for Z > 20 is post-
poned to the next section where we supplement our MBPT
values with a rigorous QED calculation of the two-photon ex-
change correction.

IV. QED TREATMENT

In this section we present an ab initio QED treatment of the
electron correlation up to second order of perturbation theory.
Considering the ﬁrst- and second-order corrections obtained
in the previous section and given by Eqs. (43) and (44), we ob-
serve that the only part that involves some approximations is
the two-photon exchange correction ∆E(2,0|2). Calculations
of this correction for Li-like ions were previously performed
in Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Our present task will be to carry
out a similar calculation for the same model potentials as in
our MBPT treatment.

General formulas for the two-photon exchange correction
are derived by the two-time Green’s function method [49, 50].
The correction can be conveniently represented by a sum of
the two-electron (“2el”) and three-electron (“3el”) contribu-
tions, each of which is subdivided into the irreducible (“ir”)
and the reducible (“red”) parts,

∆E(2,0|2) = ∆E2el

We mention that the formulas (48)-(55) reduce to the
MBPT expression (24) after neglecting (i) the energy depen-
dence of the operator I(ω) in the Coulomb gauge and (ii) the
negative-energy part of the Dirac spectrum. Within this ap-
proximation, all reducible parts vanish and the ω integration
can be performed by Cauchy’s theorem.

The numerical evaluation of expressions (48)-(55) was per-
formed by using the scheme described in detail in Refs. [11,
12, 15]. Summations over the Dirac spectrum were carried out
by using the dual-kinetic-balance basis set [39] constructed
with B-splines; the typical value for the number of splines was
65. The numerical uncertainty of our results was estimated to
be of about 1

The results of our calculations for the n = 2 states of Li-
like zinc (Z = 30) and bismuth (Z = 83) are presented in
Tables II and III, respectively. The entry “2-photon(QED)”
represents the difference of the two-photon exchange correc-
tion calculated within QED and within MBPT. For the mo-
ment, we disregard uncertainties due to the nuclear size and
the higher-order correlation; the purpose of Tables II and III
is to illustrate the convergence of results obtained for different
model potentials.

We observe that the total values obtained with the KS and
the LDF potential almost coincide with each other for the both
cases studied, whereas the Coulomb-potential value is slightly
apart from the other two. The third-order correction turns out
to be rather small for the KS and LDF potentials but is numer-
ically signiﬁcant in the Coulomb case. In the case of bismuth,
we compare our results with the ones obtained previously by
Sapirstein and Cheng [13], whose approach was very similar
to ours. We report a good agreement with their calculation for
the results obtained with the KS potential (a deviation for the
2s state is mainly due to a different nuclear radius used in that
work). However, the results obtained with the Coulomb po-
tential exhibit a small but noticeable difference. This is due to
a certain disagreement in values for the three-photon exchange
correction. For the KS potential and Z = 83, this correction
is nearly negligible so that the discrepancy does not play any
role.
It can be mentioned that the differences between our
Coulomb and KS results are much smaller than those reported
by Sapirstein and Cheng.

Our Coulomb results for the three-photon exchange correc-
tion and Z = 30 presented in Table II are in reasonable agree-

for the 2s state and
0.0015 a.u. for the 2p1/2 state. How-
ever, we disagree with them for the contribution induced by
two Breit and one Coulomb interactions (which we calculated
but did not include into the total values); our result for the
2p1/2 state is six times smaller.

We performed our QED calculations of the two-photon ex-
change correction for the nuclear charge numbers in the range
92. At the lowest value considered, Z = 10, the
10
difference of the QED and MBPT results is already smaller
10−5 a.u.,
than the accuracy we are presently interested in, 1
for all n = 2 states. The difference scales as Z 3 and is con-
sidered negligible for Z < 10. In Fig. 4, we plot this differ-
ence scaled by a factor of (Zα)3 as a function of the nuclear
charge number. We observe that the “pure” QED part of the
two-photon exchange correction is remarkably small for the
2s and 2p1/2 states even in the high-Z region but is much
larger in the case of the 2p3/2 state.

×

Our total results for the electronic-structure corrections to
the ionization potential of the n = 2 states of Li-like ions
are collected in Table VI. The values for the lightest atoms
with Z = 3 and 4 are given only for the completeness; by
far more accurate calculations are available for these systems
[42, 43, 44].

The column labeled “Dirac” contains the energy values (mi-
nus mc2) obtained from the Dirac equation with the Fermi-
like nuclear potential. The values for the the nuclear-charge
root-mean-square (rms) radii and their uncertainties are listed
in the second column of the table. They were taken from

11

Ref. [51] except for few cases with no experimental data
available (Z = 43, 61, 85, 89, and 91), in which case we
used the interpolation formula from Ref. [52] and assigned
an uncertainty of 1% to these values. The dependence of
the Dirac value on the nuclear model was conservatively esti-
mated by comparing the results obtained within the Fermi and
the homogeneously-charged-sphere models.

The entries “1-photon”, “2-ph.[MBPT]”, and “3-photon”
contain results for the one-, two-, and three-photon exchange
corrections evaluated within MBPT with the LDF potential
and given by Eqs. (43)-(45), respectively. The entry “2-
ph.[QED]” represents the difference of the two-photon ex-
change correction evaluated within QED and MBPT, i.e., the
difference of Eqs. (47) and (44). The numerical uncertainty
of 1
is not speciﬁed explicitly in Table VI but
included into the total error estimate.

10−5 a.u.

×

The column “h.o.” contains errors due the higher-order ef-
fects neglected in the present investigation. Our estimations
for these effects consist of two parts that are added quadrat-
ically, the residual electron correlation and the QED part of
the three-photon exchange correction. The residual correla-
tion was discussed in the previous section; it has its maximum
for Z = 3 and decreases rapidly when Z increases. Mak-
ing a comparison with more precise calculations available for
lithium and beryllium allow us to be reasonably conﬁdent of
this part of our error estimate.

An estimation of residual three-photon QED effects is more
difﬁcult to make reliably. Fig. 4 leads us to surmise that QED
part of the two-photon exchange correction is anomalously
small for the 2s and 2p1/2 states; moreover, it changes its sign
when Z is varied (for 2p states). An estimate based on the
ratio of the QED and MBPT two-photon contributions would
thus likely to underestimate the three-photon QED effects. We
choose to base our estimation on the three-photon MBPT con-
tribution induced by two Breit and one Coulomb interactions;
let us denote it by ∆E(3)
B). It has the same scal-
ing order as the QED contribution [α3(Zα)2] and it does not
change its sign through the Z range of interest. For the 2s and
2p1/2 states, we take the absolute value of this contribution
for the estimation of three-photon QED effects. For the 2p3/2
state, we multiply its value by the ratio

whose numerical contribution varies from 1 in the middle-Z
region to 5 in the high-Z region.

We are now in a position to compare our numerical results
for the electronic-structure part of the 2pJ -2s transition ener-
gies with results of other investigations. We selected three ex-
tensive investigations of the electronic structure of Li-like ions
to compare with, which were accomplished by three indepen-
dent methods: MBPT [21], the multiconﬁgurational Dirac-
Fock (MCDF) method [22], and the conﬁguration interaction
(CI) method [23]. It should be noted that none of these cal-
culations accounted for the QED part of the two-photon ex-
change correction, which is included into consideration in the
present work.

previous calculations (dots, MBPT [21]; stars, CI [23]; triangles, MCDF [22]). The dotted line represents the estimated error of our results due
to the residual electron correlation; the dashed line denotes the QED part of the two-photon exchange correction accounted for in the present

FIG. 4: The difference of the QED and MBPT results for the two-photon exchange correction for the 2s, 2p1/2, and 2p3/2 states of Li-like

In Fig. 5, we plot the deviation of our numerical values
for the electronic-structure part of the 2p3/2-2s and 2p1/2-2s
transition energies of Li-like ions from the results of previ-
ous calculations. The electronic-structure part can be unam-
biguously isolated from the data presented in Refs. [21, 23];
from Ref. [22], we had to subtract the mass-polarization term,
which is explicitly given there for Z = 15, 54 and 92 only. In
Fig. 5, the dotted line indicates the estimated error of our re-
sults due to the residual correlation; the dashed line stands for
the QED part of the two-photon exchange correction, which
is accounted for in our calculation but is omitted in previous
studies.

We observe a distinct and nearly Z-independent deviation
of our results from the MCDF values, which is on the level
of about 0.005-0.01 a.u.
for the 2p1/2-2s transition and of
about 0.003 a.u. for the 2p3/2-2s transition. Agreement with
the MBPT and CI results is much better; one can observe that
the main part of the deviation is, as expected, due to the QED
effects not accounted for in the previous studies.

V. TRANSITION ENERGIES IN LI-LIKE IONS

A number of important corrections should be added to the
electronic-structure part of transition energies addressed to in
the previous section in order to allow an adequate compari-
son with experimental data. We now brieﬂy discuss various
theoretical contributions to the 2p1/2-2s and 2p3/2-2s transi-
tion energies in Li-like ions. Our discussion is summarized
by Tables IV and V, where various individual contributions
are collected for several medium-Z ions.

The largest effect to be added to the electronic-structure
part is the one-loop QED contribution. It consists of the self-
energy and vacuum-polarization corrections and is presently
well-understood; we refer the reader to the review [18] for
the details. The numerical values listed in Tables IV and V
represent the one-loop QED correction calculated on the hy-
drogenic wave functions.

The next effect is the screening of the one-loop QED cor-
rections by other electrons. Rigorous evaluations of the ﬁrst-
order (in 1/Z) screening effects were performed for Li-like
ions in our previous investigations [9, 10, 16]; a similar cal-
culation was carried out for Li-like bismuth by Sapirstein and
Cheng [13]. Higher-order screening effects have not been cal-
culated up to now. The error due to their neglect has to be
estimated with some care since it presently yields the dom-
inant theoretical uncertainty for medium-Z ions. To obtain
such an estimate, we recall that, within the Zα expansion, the
dominant part of the screening of one-electron QED correc-
tions can be described [58, 59] by incorporating the correct
electron density at the nucleus into the hydrogenic formulas.
For the 2p-2s transition, the nonrelativistic electron density at
the origin is given by [60]

≈ −

The ratio of the second and the ﬁrst term in the above ex-
pression (
2.7/Z) is very close to the actual ratio of the
ﬁrst-order screening contribution to the hydrogenic one. We
estimate the ratio of the higher-order effects to the ﬁrst-order
screening by taking the ratio of the Z −2 term in Eq. (56) to
the Z −1 one and multiplying it by a conservative factor of 2,
the resulting scaling factor thus being 0.8/Z.

Another important effect to be taken into account is the
recoil correction. Rigorous QED calculations of the leading
term of the 1/Z expansion of this correction were performed
in Refs. [19, 20]. The higher-order (in 1/Z) part of the recoil
effect has been addressed to in the case of Li-like ions only
nonrelativistically up to now. Within the nonrelativistic ap-
proximation, we obtain it by evaluating the reduced-mass cor-
rection to the electronic-structure part of order 1/Z and higher
and (for the 2p states) by adding the part of the mass polariza-
tion of order 1/Z and higher inferred from the Hughes-Eckart
formula [61]. A 100% uncertainty was acribed to the part of
the recoil effect obtained within the nonrelativistic approxi-
mation.

Finally, we should account for the two-loop QED effects.
The ﬁrst complete all-order calculation of the two-loop one-
electron QED corrections for n = 2 states was recently ac-
60. In order
complished in Ref. [17] for several ions with Z
to complete our compilation for ions with Z = 26, 28, 36, and
47 in Tables IV and V, we need values for the two-loop QED
corrections outside the Z range covered in Ref. [17]. To this
end, we performed calculations of the two-loop diagrams in-
volving closed electron loops. In notations of Ref. [17], these
are the subsets “SEVP”, “VPVP”, and “S(VP)E”. The results
are presented in Tables IV and V; the error bars indicated are
due to the free-loop approximation employed in the evaluation
of the VPVP and S(VP)E subsets, see Ref. [17] for details.

≥

The remaining two-loop self-energy correction (the
“SESE” subset) is much more difﬁcult to calculate and we ob-
tain its numerical values by an extrapolation. For the 2s state,
the extrapolation was performed in two steps. First, we obtain
numerical values for the 1s state, which was done by interpo-
lating the numerical results of Ref. [62]. Second, we obtain
results for the weighted difference of the 2s and 1s correc-
δE1s. This was achieved by subtracting
tions, ∆s = 8 δE2s −
all Zα-expansion contributions known (see Refs. [63, 64] and
references therein) from the all-order results of Ref. [17] and
extrapolating the higher-order remainder towards the values
of Z of interest. An uncertainty of 30% was ascribed to these
results. For the 2p states, the correction is much smaller and,
for our purposes, it is sufﬁcient to obtain just the boundaries
for the higher-order remainder. The comparison [65] of the
all-order numerical values with the Zα-expansion results sug-
2 α2(Zα)6/(8 π2) for the higher-order
gests an estimate of
remainder.

±

Considering the data presented in Tables IV and V, we no-
tice a remarkably good agreement of our total values with
the experimental results. The theoretical accuracy is lower
than the experimental one in the case of iron and nickel but
signiﬁcantly better for krypton and silver. It should be men-
tioned that the leading theoretical uncertainty for medium-Z
ions stems presently from the higher-order screening and re-

coil effects. In this respect, the situation for medium-Z ions
is different from the one encountered in the high-Z region,
where the uncertainties due to the ﬁnite nuclear size effect
and due to the two-loop QED corrections become prominent
[17].

The uncertainty due to the screening of QED effects can be
reduced by calculating the one-loop and the ﬁrst-order screen-
ing QED corrections not on hydrogenic wave functions but in
the presence of a local screening potential, as it was done in
the case of bismuth in Ref. [13]. The uncertainty of the recoil
effect can also be improved by calculating the higher-order
(in 1/Z) recoil correction within the leading relativistic ap-
proximation. This means that the theoretical accuracy can be
pushed even further in the near future.

For the ﬁrst two terms of the expansion, rigorous QED calcu-
lations were performed, whereas the third-order contribution
was evaluated within the MBPT approximation. Errors due to
truncation of the perturbative expansion and due to usage of
the MBPT approximation in the third-order correction were
estimated.

Collecting all theoretical contributions available for the
2pJ-2s transition energies, we observed good agreement with
experimental results for medium-Z ions. The dominant un-
certainty of the theoretical results in the medium-Z region is
shown to originate from the higher-order screening of QED
corrections and from the recoil effect. Further improvement
of the theoretical accuracy is anticipated for medium-Z ions.

VI. CONCLUSION

Acknowledgements

In this paper we have presented a systematic QED treatment
of the electron correlation for n = 2 states of Li-like ions. The
treatment relies on the perturbative expansion, with a local
model potential included into the zeroth-order approximation.

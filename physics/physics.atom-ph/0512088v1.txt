We present accurate ab initio non-perturbative calculations of the Breit correction to the parity
non-conserving (PNC) amplitudes of the 6s−7s and 6s−5d3/2 transitions in Cs, 7s−8s and 7s−6d3/2
transitions in Fr, 6s − 5d3/2 transition in Ba+, 7s − 6d3/2 transition in Ra+, and 6p1/2 − 6p3/2
transition in Tl. The results for the 6s − 7s transition in Cs and 7s − 8s transition in Fr are in good
agreement with other calculations while calculations for other atoms/transitions are presented for
the ﬁrst time. We demonstrate that higher-orders many-body corrections to the Breit interaction
are especially important for the s − d PNC amplitudes. We conﬁrm good agreement of the PNC
measurements for cesium and thallium with the standard model .

I.

INTRODUCTION

Study of the parity non-conservation (PNC) in atoms
have reached the accuracy where small corrections like
Breit interaction and radiative corrections play signiﬁ-
cant role (see, e.q. review [1]). For example, experimen-
tal accuracy for the PNC in cesium is 0.35% [2]. Inter-
pretation of this result using earlier atomic calculations
[3, 4] lead to apparent disagreement with the standard
model [5]. This disagreement had been resolved when
Breit [6, 7, 8] and radiative [9, 10, 11] corrections were
included into analysis.

In present paper we revisit Breit corrections to the
PNC amplitudes in many-electron atoms. Previous cal-
culations were focused on the 6s − 7s PNC amplitude in
Cs [6, 7, 8, 21], while some also considered very similar
(in terms of electron structure) 7s − 8s PNC amplitude
in Fr [11, 19, 20]. The results are considered to be in
reasonable agreement with each other in spite of some
diﬀerence in the ﬁnal values given by diﬀerent calcula-
tions (up to ∼ 30%). This is because Breit correction to
the PNC amplitude in cesium was small (∼ −0.6%) and
relatively rough estimations were suﬃcient for the sake
of the interpretation of the experimental measurements.
However, if we need to calculate Breit corrections to
PNC in atoms heavier than cesium or, in general, if we
want to have a reliable method to study the eﬀect of Breit
interaction in heavy many-electron atoms the important
question to ask is what kind of approach should be used
to do this? The answer is evident from the analysis of
the details of the calculations of Breit contributions by
means of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The
analysis reveals very poor convergence of the MBPT with

respect to the number of residual Coulomb interactions
included into the higher-order terms. This means that
some all-order technique is needed to sum up important
chains of higher-order terms to all orders. The natural
choice is to present inter-electron interaction as a sum of
Coulomb and Breit terms and to treat both terms the
same way.

We have developed such approach in our previous
work [7] and applied it to the analysis of the PNC in
cesium. Breit and Coulomb interaction were equally
treated on the self-consistent ﬁeld level (Hartree-Fock
and random-phase approximation calculations). How-
ever, inclusion of the Breit interaction into calculation
of the correlations was not comprehensive. In that work
we included correlations by calculating the correlation
potential ˆΣ for valence electrons, using it to calculate
the so-called Brueckner orbitals for the states of valence
electrons, and then replacing Hartree-Fock orbitals by
Brueckner orbitals in the E1P N C amplitude. Brueckner
orbitals were calculated with Breit interaction included
into self-consistent Hartree-Fock potential while correla-
tion potential ˆΣ was calculated without inclusion of the
Breit interaction.

In present work we do one more step by including
Breit interaction into second-oder correlation potential
ˆΣ thus achieving equal and comprehensive treatment of
Coulomb and Breit interactions on levels up to second or-
der of the many-body perturbation theory. We apply this
approach to the calculation of the Breit corrections to the
PNC amplitudes in neutral cesium, thallium and fran-
cium as well as barium and radium positive ions. This
is the full list of atoms and ions with one external elec-
tron above closed shells for which PNC measurements
were done or planned. Our calculations represent the
most comprehensive treatment of the Breit contribution
to the PNC in many-electron atoms. The results for Tl,
Ba+, Ra+ as well as for the s − d transitions for Cs and
Fr are presented for the ﬁrst time.

The method developed in present work is important

not only for the PNC in many-electron atoms. It can be
equally useful for calculation of Breit interaction con-
tribution to any observable values enhanced on short
distances. These include magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole hyperﬁne structure, isotope shift, T-odd ef-
fects, etc.

II. THEORY

We use the following form of the Breit operator [15]

(atomic units are used throughout the paper)

ˆH B = −

α1 · α2 + (α1 · ˆn)(α2 · ˆn)
2r

.

(1)

Here r = ˆnr, r is distance between electrons and αi is
α-matrix of the corresponding electron. This is a low fre-
quency limit of the relativistic correction to the Coulomb
interaction between electrons. It contains magnetic inter-
action and retardation.

Similar to Coulomb interaction, Breit interaction cre-

ates self-consistent Breit potential

Here summation goes over all core states.
In the case
of closed-shell atoms (like alkali atoms in the V N −1 ap-
proximation) direct term in Breit potential vanishes (ﬁrst
term in (2)) and only second, exchange, term remains.

Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian has the form

ˆH0 = cαp + (β − 1)mc2 −

+ ˆV ,

(3)

Ze2
r

where ˆV is the self-consistent potential created by elec-
trons from the core. To achieve comprehensive treatment
of the Breit interaction potential ˆV should be presented
as a sum of Coulomb and Breit terms

ˆV = ˆV C + ˆV B.

(4)

Note that we write for simplicity nuclear potential in (3)
as for point-like nucleus. However, our actual potential
takes into account ﬁnite nuclear size.

To do PNC calculations one needs to take into account
dipole interaction of an atom with external photon as
well as weak interaction of atomic electrons with the nu-
cleus. We use the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method
(TDHF) to do this [16]. This method is equivalent to
well-known random-phase approximation (RPA).

For every electron in the atom, single electron wave

function is presented in the form

2

where index n numerates single-electron states, ψn is un-
perturbed wave function for the state n which is an eigen-
state of the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian (3), δψn is correc-
tion to ψn due to weak interaction with the nucleus, Xn
and Yn are corrections due to electric ﬁeld of external
photon of frequency ω, δXn and δYn are corrections due
to simultaneous action of the weak interaction and dipole
interaction with external photon.

Corrections δψn, Xn, Yn, δXn, δYn to all atomic states
found by self-consistent iteration of the TDHF equations:
( ˆH0 − ǫn)δψn = −( ˆHW + δ ˆVW )ψn,
( ˆH0 − ǫn − ω)Xn = −( ˆHE1 + δ ˆVE1)ψn,
( ˆH0 − ǫn + ω)Yn = −( ˆH †

(8)

− δ ˆVW Xn − δ ˆVE1W ψn,
E1δψn

− δ ˆVW Yn − δ ˆV †

E1W ψn.

Here δ ˆV is correction to the self-consistent Hartree-Fock
potential ˆV due to external ﬁeld (weak (W ), dipole elec-
tric (E1) or both (E1W )). Equations (6,7,8) are ﬁrst
solved self-consistently for states in the core. Then cor-
rections to valence states are calculated in the ﬁeld of
frozen core.

PNC amplitude for the transition between valence

states a and b in the TDHF approximation is

P N C = hψb| ˆHE1 + δ ˆVE1|δψai

(9)

+ hψb| ˆHW + δ ˆVW |Xai + hψb|δ ˆVE1W |ψai.

Breit interaction is included by using expression (4) for
the self-consistent potential on all stages of the calcu-
lations.
In other words, Hartree-Fock potential in the
left-hand side of equations (6,7,8) is the sum of Coulomb
and Breit terms. Correction to the potential δ ˆV in the
right-hand side of equations (6,7,8,9) is also the sum of
Coulomb and Breit terms:

δ ˆV = δ ˆV C + δ ˆV B.

Expression (9) does not take into account correlations.
To include correlations we introduce correlation potential
ˆΣ. It is deﬁned in such a way that its average value over
particular valence state a is the correlation correction to
the energy of this state (see, e.g. [16] for details):

∆ǫa = ha| ˆΣ|ai.

(10)

ˆΣ is a non-local operator which depends on energy and
parameter κ which deﬁnes the angular part of wave func-
tion ψa: κa = (−1)la+ja+1/2(ja+1/2), where la is angular
momentum and ja is total momentum of state a.

In linear in ˆΣ approximation, correlation correction to

the PNC amplitude is

˜ψn = ψn + δψn + Xae−iωt + Yneiωt

+ δXne−iωt + δYneiωt,

In the most precise calculations of the PNC in ce-
sium [3, 17], operator ˆΣ was calculated in all orders in
Coulomb interaction. For the purpose of the present work
we can restrict ourself with the lowest, second-order ex-
pression for ˆΣ. Corresponding Brueckner-Goldstone di-
agrams are presented on Fig. 1. Breit interaction is in-
cluded in calculation of ˆΣ in two ways. First, a complete
set of single-electron states used to calculate ˆΣ was ob-
tained with the use of the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian (3)
with Breit potential included as in eq. (4). Second, inter-
electron interaction in ˆΣ (wave lines in all diagrams on
Fig. 1) is the sum of Coulomb (e2/r) and Breit (1) terms.
The total PNC amplitude in linear in ˆΣ approximation

is

EP N C = ET DHF

P N C + ∆EP N C .

(12)

We also use a more accurate way of calculating correla-
tion corrections which includes correlation potential ˆΣ to
all orders. We do this with the help of so-called Brueck-
ner orbitals [16]. Brueckner orbitals are found by includ-
ing ˆΣ into Hartree-Fock equations for valence states. For
example, for the states a and b Brueckner orbitals ψBr
and ψBr
and corresponding energies ǫa and ǫb are found
by solving

Finally we note that non-perturbative treatment
of Breit
to inclusion of higher-
order in Breit operator terms, terms proportional to
( ˆH B)2,( ˆH B)3, etc. with ˆH B given by (1).
Inclusion
of these terms cannot be justiﬁed since expression (1)
is already approximate. Non-linear terms can be eas-
ily eliminated by a rescaling procedure.
In this proce-
dure inter-electron interaction is considered as a sum
U (r) = e2/r + λ ˆH B in which Breit interaction ˆH B is
multiplied by a scaling parameter λ. By running pro-
grams for diﬀerent values of λ a range of values is found
for which ﬁnal answer is linear function of λ. Then the
answer is interpolated to λ = 1. It turns out, however,
that as a rule λ = 1 is already in linear regime.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table I presents results of calculations of the Breit cor-
rection to the PNC amplitudes in Cs, Ba, Tl, Fr and Ra.
This is the full list of atoms with one external electron
above closed shells for which PNC measurement has been
carried out or planned. Comparison with other calcula-
tions for the 6s − 7s transition in Cs and 7s − 8s tran-
sition in Fr are presented in Table VI. The results for
other atoms and for the s − d transitions in Cs and Fr
are presented for the ﬁrst time.

Note that for all PNC amplitudes presented in Table I
the eﬀect of correlations on Breit correction is small in
ˆΣ(2) approximation. It becomes signiﬁcant for some s-d
amplitudes only in Brueckner approximation. This is be-
cause the correlation corrections in d-wave are large and
signiﬁcantly change density of the valence electron inside
electron core. Therefore, we should perform calculations
using Bruckner orbitals which include ˆΣ to all orders.
The linear in ˆΣ expressions (11),(12) do not provide sat-
isfactory accuracy.

As one can see from Table I the behavior of s−s and s−
d PNC amplitudes is very diﬀerent. Let us discuss them
separately.
It is convenient to use the sum-over-states
expression for the E1 PNC amplitude for the discussion:

ˆHE1 +δ ˆVE1 and ˆW = ˆHW +δ ˆVW . Equation (16) is an ac-
curate expression for the E1 PNC amplitude if all states
|ai, |bi, |ni are exact many-electron states of the whole
atom. However, for our discussion we will consider only
states which diﬀer from the ground state by excitation
of the single valence electron. This is reasonably good
approximation for alkali atoms and it is suﬃcient for the
discussion. In this case matrix elements in (16) are re-
duced to single-electron matrix elements and we will refer
to this expression as sum over single-electron states.

As one can see from Table I, Breit contribution to the
correlation correction to the s − s PNC amplitudes is
small. This can be explained the following way. Breit and
weak interactions are both short-range operators. They
have signiﬁcant value in the vicinity of nucleus where all
single-electron wave functions are similar and diﬀer by
normalization only.
Indeed, Dirac equation for all low
states is the same on short distances since energy can
be neglected compared to the nuclear potential. On the
other hand, higher states with large energies do not con-
tribute to the sum (16) due to large energy denominator.
Therefore, relative value of Breit correction to all weak

matrix elements in (16) is the same and can be presented
as a common factor outside of the summation. The eﬀect
of correlations on short distances can also be reduced to
change of normalization of the wave function. Therefore,
relative Breit correction should remain the same.

This way of argument was used in calculating radiative
corrections to the PNC amplitude in cesium [9, 10, 11,
12]. Moreover, it was assumed in [10] that to ﬁnd radia-
tive correction it is suﬃcient to consider only corrections
to the weak matrix elements. Radiative corrections to E1
transition amplitudes and energies were not considered
because it was believed that corresponding contritions to
the PNC amplitude are small and can be neglected. It
was demonstrated in [12, 13] that radiative corrections to
the PNC amplitude in cesium due to change of energy de-
nominators and change of E1 transition amplitudes (see,
eq. (16)) are not so small when taken separately. But
they cancel each other almost exactly when taken to-
gether.

It is interesting to note that very similar situation takes
place for the Breit correction. As it was ﬁrst demon-
strated by Derevianko [6, 14] and then conﬁrmed by
Dzuba et al [7], the eﬀects of Breit interaction on the
PNC amplitude in cesium due to change of energy de-

nominators and change of E1 transition amplitudes are
not small, numerically very close, and have opposite
signs. Corresponding numbers are -0.4% [6, 7] for the
eﬀect on E1 amplitudes and 0.3% [6] and 0.4% [7] for
the eﬀect on energies. There is almost exact numerical
cancellation between two eﬀects. Similar situation takes
place for francium.

However, as it is clear from the analysis of the s − d
PNC amplitudes, numerical cancellation of the eﬀect of
Breit interaction on energies and E1 transition ampli-
tudes is a fortunate feature of the s − s PNC amplitudes
rather than a general situation. The same might be true
for the radiative corrections to the PNC amplitudes.

In Table II we present the relative values of the eﬀect
of Breit interaction on the s − p and p − d weak ma-
trix elements between lowest valence states of ﬁve con-
sidered atoms. These states give dominant contribution
to the PNC amplitudes. Matrix elements are calculated
in Brueckner approximation:

Wab = hψBr

b

| ˆHW + δ ˆVW |ψBr

a i.

Note, however, that relative value of the Breit correction
to the s − p weak matrix elements does not depend on
the approximation.
It is also the same for states with
diﬀerent principal quantum number n as far as the energy
of this state is small compared to −Ze2/RN , where RN
is nuclear radius (see discussion above for more details).
Breit correction to the PNC amplitude is approximately
equal to the Breit correction to the weak matrix element
only for the s − s PNC transitions of Cs and Fr. There is
no obvious connection between the two for all other PNC
amplitudes. This indicates a signiﬁcant role of the Breit
correction to the E1 amplitudes and the energies for the
p − d and p1/2 − p3/2 PNC amplitudes (see eq. (16)).

Another distinctive feature of the s − d PNC ampli-
tudes which can be easily seen from Table I is the signif-
icant and non-trivial role of the correlations. One would
expect that correlations either play no role as for the
s − s PNC amplitudes or enhance the eﬀect of Breit in-
teraction. Indeed, correlations increase electron density
on short distances which would lead to expectations that
the role of the Breit interaction should also increase. In
fact, the opposite happens. As it is evident from Table I
correlations decrease the Breit correction to the s − d
PNC amplitude.

To understand this behavior let us start our analysis
from single-electron matrix elements of weak interaction.

5

Arguments in favor of the small role of correlations pre-
sented above for the s − s PNC amplitudes were based
on the fact that both Breit and weak interactions are lo-
calized on short distances. While it is true for the “bare”
operator of the weak interaction, it is not exactly true
when many-body eﬀects are also included. The eﬀective
operator of the weak interaction can be presented in the
form

ˆH eﬀ

W = ˆHW + δ ˆVW ,

(17)

where ﬁrst term is proportional to nuclear density and
is zero everywhere outside the nucleus. Second term is
due to change in self-consistent Hartree-Fock potential
because of the eﬀect of weak interaction. It describes the
so-called core polarization eﬀect and its radius is roughly
equal to the radius of atomic core. For the s − p matrix
elements core polarization is just small correction to the
leading ﬁrst term. Therefore all considerations based on
assumption that weak interaction is localized on short
distances are still approximately valid.

For the p − d weak matrix elements ﬁrst term in (17)
gives zero for the point-like nucleus and all value for the
matrix elements is given by the second, core polarization
term. Even for ﬁnite size nucleus, contribution of the
ﬁrst term in (17) is several orders of magnitude smaller
than of the second term. This means that p − d weak
matrix elements don’t come from short distances and all
arguments based on that assumption are not valid for
them.

The E1P N C amplitude can be presented as a sum of
three terms (see eq. (15)). Corresponding numbers for
the s − d PNC amplitudes in Cs, Ba+, Fr and Ra+ as
well as for the 6p1/2 − 6p3/2 PNC amplitude in Tl are
presented in Table III. The numbers in table are orga-
nized in such a way that the term which is proportional
to the s − p weak matrix element goes ﬁrst, second term
is proportional to the p − d matrix element and the last
term has the mix of both. Note that this last term is
not included to the sum over single-electron states ex-
pression (16). It is small for alkali atoms. However, it is
not negligible and we present it here to demonstrate that
its inclusion is important for accurate calculations.

The numbers in the table indicate that, as one would
expect, term proportional to the s − p matrix element
strongly dominates in the E1P N C amplitude. However,
the term proportional to the p − d weak matrix element
is not small at all and brings signiﬁcant complications
to the behavior of the E1P N C amplitudes. The case of
particular interest is comparison of the s − d PNC am-
plitudes of Cs and Ba+. As one can see from Table I
the role of correlations in the Breit correction to these
E1P N C amplitudes is very much diﬀerent in cases of Cs
and Ba+. Correlations almost do not change Breit cor-
rection to the s− d PNC amplitude in Ba+. On the other
hand, their eﬀect on the s−d PNC amplitude in Cs is sig-
niﬁcant. Moreover, it goes contrary to naive expectations

lations on the density of external electron on short dis-
tances suggests that it should be rather larger. Another
interesting thing is the diﬀerence between the results for
Cs obtained in the ˆΣ(2) approximation (formula (12))
and Brueckner approximation (formula (15)). These two
expressions diﬀer by higher orders in ˆΣ. Therefore the
diﬀerence in results indicates important role of high-order
ˆΣ terms. This is an interesting fact given that the term
linear in ˆΣ strongly dominates in the correlation correc-
tion to the PNC amplitude. Situation for the correlated
Breit correction is opposite. The term linear in ˆΣ is small
and higher-order terms dominate.

For a more detailed analysis of the s − d PNC ampli-
tudes in Cs and Ba+ we present another set of data in
Table IV. This data is similar to those in Table III but
in TDHF approximation. Data presented in Table III is
in Brueckner approximation which means that correla-
tions are included to all orders in ˆΣ. In contrast, data
from Table IV contains no correlations. Comparison of
the data in Table III and Table IV shows that correla-
tion correction to terms proportional to the s − p weak
matrix elements is small. This is similar to the s − s
PNC amplitude and the same arguments are valid to ex-
plain this. On the other hand, correlations signiﬁcantly
increase (by an order of magnitude) the contribution of
the terms proportional to the p−d weak matrix elements.
Correspondingly, Breit correction also increases. This is
also well expected fact given that correlations increase

density of external electron in the core. In summary, dif-
ferent behavior of the s−p and p−d weak matrix elements
with respect to correlations is due to diﬀerent distances
from which these matrix elements get their values. The
s−p matrix elements are well localized at atomic nucleus,
while p − d matrix elements localized on much larger dis-
tances inside atomic core.

Since correlations have diﬀerent eﬀect on Breit correc-
tion to the 6s1/2 − 5d3/2 PNC amplitude in Cs depending
on whether they are included in linear in ˆΣ approxima-
tion (formula (12)) of in all-order Bruekner approxima-
tion (formula (15)), it is important to check that all dif-
ference is due to higher order in ˆΣ terms. To do this we
extract linear in ˆΣ contribution from Brueckner approx-
imation and compare it with the result obtained using
formula (12). This is done with the use of rescaling pro-
cedure similar to those discussed in the end of previous
section for the Breit operator. However, this time we
rescale correlation potential ˆΣ. Namely, we replace ˆΣ in
eqs. (13) and (14) by S ˆΣ, where S is rescaling parameter.
Calculating Breit correction with S ≪ 1 and extrapolat-
ing it to S = 1 leaves only linear in ˆΣ contributions. The
results are presented in Table V. Extrapolation to S = 1
is done using the formula

of Table V. One can see that the value of Breit correc-
tion calculated at S = 0.1 and extrapolated to S = 1
(-0.017571) practically coincide with the value -0.0176
obtained using formula (12) (see Table I). For larger val-
ues of S non-linear in ˆΣ terms become important and
rapidly change the value of Breit correction.

There are few more important conclusions which can
be drawn from the fact that Breit correction to a PNC
amplitude is only sensitive to change of the electron den-
sity. This change of density is proportional to the value
of the correlation potential ˆΣ. Therefore, it is important
to check how inclusion of some extra terms into ˆΣ aﬀect
the value of the Breit correction to the PNC amplitudes.
For example, inclusion of the Breit interaction itself into
calculation of ˆΣ does not change its value very much.
Corresponding change of removal energies of Cs is less
than 0.02%, while change of the 6s−6p1/2 energy interval
is 0.04% only. Test calculations show that corresponding
change to the PNC amplitude is also small, it is 0.04%
for the 6s − 5d3/2 PNC amplitude and even smaller for
the 6s − 7s PNC amplitude. On the other hand, it is well
known from a number of calculations (see, e.g. [18]) that
inclusion into ˆΣ of certain higher-order Coulomb terms
leads to signiﬁcant change in the value of ˆΣ and electron
density on short distances, brining theoretical values for
energies, hyperﬁne structure, transition amplitudes, etc.
to much better agreement with the experiment. There-
fore, it would be inappropriate to assume a priori that
higher-order Coulomb terms do not aﬀect Breit correc-
tion. This is to be checked numerically. We have per-

formed such calculations and the results show that the
eﬀect of the higher-order Coulomb terms in ˆΣ is indeed
small. Its value is close to the eﬀect of inclusion of Breit
interaction into ˆΣ. Moreover, the two eﬀects tend to can-
cel each other. One can say therefore that inclusion of
Breit and higher-order Coulomb terms into ˆΣ are equally
important or unimportant depending of the needed ac-
curacy.

Let us now come back to comparison of the s − d PNC
amplitude for Cs and Ba+ for few more important obser-
vations. If terms proportional to s − p and p − d weak
matrix elements are compared separately, their behavior
is very similar for both atoms. This is a natural conse-
quence of the similar electron structure. However, the
total s − d PNC amplitude is more sensitive to small dif-
ference in the electron structure. In Ba+ ion 5d states
are lower than the 6p states while in Cs 5d states are
higher than the 6p states. This leads to larger correla-
tion correction to the p − d part of the PNC amplitude
in Ba+ compared to those of Cs. This also leads to the
opposite sign of these terms in Ba+ and Cs. As a result,
the eﬀect of correlations on ﬁnal PNC amplitude is very
diﬀerent. In general, the eﬀect of correlations on s − d
and p1/2 − p3/2 amplitudes is very hard to predict due
to diﬀerent behavior of terms proportional to s − p and
p − d weak matrix elements.

Having accurate results for Breit correction to the PNC
amplitudes for many atoms we can now check how they
rescale with the nuclear charge Z. This would allow us
to obtain Breit correction for other atoms without doing

It is easy to see that Breit
correction to similar amplitudes in atoms with similar
electron structure is just proportional to Z. For exam-
It is inter-
ple, ∆E1P N C (Fr) = (87/55)∆E1P N C(Cs).
esting to note that rescaling from the 6s − 7s amplitude
in Cs to the 6p1/2 − 6p3/2 amplitude in Tl gives result
which is very close to the correct answer: ∆E1P N C (Tl) =
(81/55)∆E1P N C(Cs) = −0.91% while accurate calcula-
tions give −0.92%. However, this is just fortunate coin-
cidence. Separate analysis of terms proportional to the
s − p and p − d weak matrix elements show that no reli-
able rescaling between Cs and Tl is possible. The same
is true for any other pair of the PNC amplitudes which
correspond to diﬀerent electron structures.

We present our ﬁnal results in Table VI together with
the results of other authors. The results for the 6s −
7s amplitude in Cs and 7s − 8s amplitude in Fr are in
good agreement with other calculations. However, we
believe that our results are the most accurate due to non-
perturbative treatment of the Breit interaction which is
complete up to second order of the MBPT. The results
for other atoms as well as for the s − d PNC amplitudes
for Cs and Fr are presented for the ﬁrst time.

We now can use the result of this work for the Breit
interaction contribution and our previous calculations of
other contributions to ﬁnd the PNC amplitude in 133Cs,
extract value of the weak charge and compare it with
the standard model. Our many-body calculations of the
PNC amplitude produced by the electron-nucleus weak
interaction gave the following result [17] (without the
Breit contribution and QED radiative corrections)
EP N C = −0.9060(1 ± 0.5%) × 10−11ieaB(−QW /N ) .
We take the Breit contribution -0.0056 from this work
and the QED radiative corrections -0.0029 (-0.32 % of
the PNC amplitude) from Ref. [12]. This gives

EP N C = −0.8975(1 ± 0.5%) × 10−11ieaB(−QW /N ) .

(18)
In the experiment [2] the ratio EP N C /β, where β is the

8

vector transition polarizability, actually has been mea-
sured. To extract Qw we used β = 26.99(5)a3
B obtained
in [17] as the statistical average of the two most accu-
rate values of β. From the measurements of the PNC
amplitude [2] we obtain

QW = −72.69(29)exp(36)theor .

(19)

The diﬀerence with the standard model value QSM
−73.19(3) [22] is

W =

QW − QSM

W = 0.50(46) ,

(20)

adding the errors in quadrature. Thus, the diﬀerence
between the central points is one standard deviation.
For 205Tl we use PNC amplitude from Ref. [16],

EP N C = −(27.0 ± 0.8) × 10−11ieaB(−QW /N ),
the QED radiative correction -0.57 % (see detailes in [1]),
the neutron skin correction -0.3 % [23] and the Breit cor-
rection -0.92 % from this work. The result is

EP N C = −(26.5 ± 0.8) × 10−11ieaB(−QW /N ) .

(21)

Using M1 amplitude 1.693 a.u. from [23] and measure-
ment [24] Im(EP N C /M 1) = −(14.68 ± 0.17) × 10−8 a.u.
we obtain for 205Tl

QW = −116.2(1.3)exp(3.5)theor .

The standard model value is -116.81(4) [22]. The diﬀer-
ence with the standard model for Tl is

IV. CONCLUSION

We have developed a method of non-perturbative
treatment of the Breit interaction in accurate calcula-
tions for many-electron atoms. The method has been
applied to calculation of the Breit correction to the PNC
amplitudes of Cs, Ba+, Tl, Fr and Ra+. The results for
the 6s − 7s amplitude in Cs and 7s − 8s amplitude in Fr
are in good agreement with other calculations. The re-
sults for other atoms and for the s−d PNC amplitudes for
Cs and Fr are presented for the ﬁrst time. The following
features of the Breit correction to the PNC amplitudes
have been revealed:

• The eﬀect of correlations on the s − s PNC ampli-

tudes is small.

• In contrast, correlations are important for those
PNC amplitudes which depend on the p − d weak
matrix elements between valence states.

• For accurate treatment of correlations inclusion of
linear in the correlation potential ˆΣ terms is not
enough. The main eﬀect is due to the change in
density of external electron inside the core which is
magniﬁed in higher orders in ˆΣ. It can be included
by the use of Brueckner orbitals.

9

• Inclusion of the Breit interaction as well as higher-
orders Coulomb terms into correlation potential ˆΣ
have only small eﬀect on PNC amplitudes and can
be neglected in most cases.

• Rescaling of the Breit correction to the PNC am-
plitudes using ratio of the nuclear charges Z can
only be done to similar amplitudes in atoms with
similar electron structure.

• Numerical cancellation of the eﬀects of Breit in-
teraction on E1 transition amplitudes and energy
denominators in the s − s PNC amplitudes for Cs
and Fr is rather fortunate. No such cancellation
takes place for other atoms and for the s − d ampli-
tudes of Cs and Fr. The same is probably true for
the radiative corrections to the PNC amplitudes.

Combining Breit corrections to PNC amplitudes in ce-
sium and thallium with previous accurate calculations
and measurements conﬁrms good agreement of the weak
nuclear charges of these atoms with the prediction of the
standard model.

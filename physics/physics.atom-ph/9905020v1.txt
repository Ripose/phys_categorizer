An adaption of the convergent close–coupling method
(CCC) to calculation of diﬀerential ionization cross sections
[I. Bray and D. V. Fursa, Phys. Rev. A 54, 2991 (1996)]
is analyzed in the context of the Temkin-Poet model. The
asymptotic scattering wave functions and the unitarity rela-
tion are given for the the model. Our analysis is used to
reconcile the recent criticism by G. Bencze and C. Chandler,
[Phys. Rev. A 59, 3129 (1999)] of the formulation of Bray
and Fursa. It is concluded the use of “distinguishable” elec-
trons as proposed by Bray and Fursa is not essential in the
close-coupling description of ionization.

34.80.Bm, 34.80.Dp, 03.65.Nk

The CCC method was developed initially [1,2] to de-
scribe scattering of electrons from one-electron targets.
The method made use of Laguerre basis states that are
are L2 functions to discretize the target continuum. The
method provided convergent amplitudes for scattering
to low–lying discrete states and total–ionization cross–
sections. The theory is fully symmetrized since it is
based on a symmetrized expansion of the two–electron
wave function. Bray and Fursa [3] used the fact that
the positive–energy pseudostates were approximations to
true continuum functions to propose a method for cal-
culating energy diﬀerential cross sections for ionization.
They did this in a way that preserved “two–particle” uni-
tarity implicit in the CCC formalism with the L2 target
states. This had the consequence of yielding diﬀerent
magnitude amplitudes CS(ǫa, ǫb) and CS(ǫb, ǫa) for the
same physically indistinguishable process of the two ion-
ized electrons emerging with energies ǫa, ǫb, depending on
which electron, a or b, is represented by a Coulomb wave.
Bray and Fursa argued that this asymmetry could be in-
terpreted in terms of “distinguishable” electrons. This
has been criticized by Bencze and Chandler [4] (BC) who
argue that the symmetrization property of the ampli-
tudes is a fundamental tenet of scattering theory and that
the CCC amplitudes must satisfy this property counter
to the numerical evidence. They conclude that “The nu-
merical CCC amplitudes have not, therefore, converged
to accurate approximations of the exact amplitudes.”

It is the dichotomy between a method of calculating
ionization processes that seems very impressive in the
quality of agreement achieved between theory and exper-
iment, and the criticism of the model on a very funda-
mental level, that provides the motivation for the present
work. To make the discussion as transparent as pos-

1

sible we choose the Temkin–Poet model (TP) [5,6] of
electron–hydrogen scattering. This model is the solu-
tion of the scattering problem assuming spherical aver-
aging over both electrons and solving for the total an-
gular momentum zero two–electron wave function. The
Schr¨odinger equation becomes

The solution is extended to the region x < y by using
the symmetry condition (3). The solution (4) has been
written assuming the total energy is above the ioniza-
tion threshold so the momenta are ﬁxed according to
E = ǫi + 1
j = ǫa + ǫb. As usual the momenta
for the ionized electrons are given by 1
2 k2
a(b) = ǫa(b). The
uj are the manifold of bound target states of the hydro-
gen atom target with l = 0 angular momentum. The
continuum functions are the regular l = 0 Coulomb func-
tions multipled by a Coulomb phase and normalized to a
delta function in the energy. It is obvious from the form
of the solution that the CS coeﬃcients are related to the
S–matrix elements since we have written the expansion
in terms of incoming and outgoing waves. We are not
concerned here with the problem of solving for these coef-
ﬁcients; this problem has been addressed in [5,6]. Rather
we wish to establish the form of the asymptotic scattering
functions and the form of unitarity relation that one ob-
tains for this model when the ionization channel is open.
For scattering to discrete states the asymptotic form of
Equ. (4) is

The asymptotic form for the ionization requires that
both particles go to inﬁnity and that each is represented
by an outgoing wave. Therefore it is necessary to extract
these forms from the integral term in (4). Normalizing

The integral can be readily evaluated as x, y → ∞ using
stationary phase methods (a very readable exposition is
given in ref. [7]). It is determined by the integrand in the
vicinity of the stationary points (see for example [8,9])
of the terms eikax
ikby. One ﬁnds there is no stationary
point for the exponential with −ikby, and hence no con-
tribution to the asymptotic form. The only contribution
comes, as expected, from the outgoing wave giving

The discrete scattering sector corresponds to α = 0.

We now derive the unitarity relation using the conser-
vation of ﬂux, incoming and outgoing, through a closed
surface outside which the asymptotic forms for the wave
function are appropriate. The current for the TP model
is deﬁned as j(x, y) = ℑΨS
∗∇ΨS. The surface we choose
to apply the ﬂux conservation law to is shown in Fig.1
and is formed by x = 0, y = 0, x = a and y = a. a is
assumed to be large enough to ensure use of the asymp-
totic form for ionization is justiﬁed. It is also useful to
deﬁne two strip regions running along the x– and y–
axes bounded by x = aη, y = aη where 1
2 < η < 1.
It is assumed that the ﬂux for the discrete target state
wave functions is contained within these strips for a ﬁ-
nite number of the states which we may choose to be
as large as we wish. Conservation of ﬂux requires that
2 j.dn = 0. On account of the boundary conditions (2)
and symmetry condition (3) this reduces to
R

(7)

(8)

valid only when kby >> 1. Thus in order to calculate
the ionization ﬂux we have to ensure that this condition
is met throughout the interval of integration [aη, a]. (We
note that there is a minimum value of kb ﬁxed by the
stationary phase condition (8).) These constraints may
be satisﬁed by choosing

The remaining terms in the current involve overlaps be-

of large a. Collecting all the ﬂux contributions the re-

Thus the ionization contribution to unitarity requires

Let us now turn to the close–coupling (CC) approach
and its description of ionization. One begins with an
explicitly symmetrized wave function:

Calculation of the ionization ﬂux requires more care be-
cause the asymptotic form of the Coulomb wave (6) is

This form has the unsatisfactory feature that it cannot
be expressed in the form of an outgoing wave multipled
by an amplitude that depends only on ǫa, ǫb due to the
logarithmic phases. One is forced to conclude that the
symmetrization, on its own, does not lead to a generally
acceptable form for ionization.
If the long–range loga-
rithmic phase were not present, the asymptotic form is
perfectly acceptable since one may write

2

CS(CC)

sym (ǫa, ǫb) = CS(CC)(ǫa, ǫb) + (−1)SCS(CC)(ǫb, ǫa) (19)

sym (ǫa, ǫb) = (−1)SCS(CC)

and CS(CC)
sym (ǫb, ǫa) as demanded
by conventional quantum theory for identical particles as
emphasised by Bencze and Chandler [4]. Further, note
also that there is no unique form for the f S(CC)(ǫa, ǫb) in
Eq. (15), and hence for the CS(CC)(ǫa, ǫb) of Eq. (17).
Thus the N → ∞ limit in BC cannot be taken as unam-
biguously as they assume and the CCC equations do not
have to converge necessarily to a symmetrized ionization
amplitude.

Let us now examine how to apply these considerations
to the CCC method for ionization. In this method the ex-
pansion over the complete set of target states is replaced
by a set of L2 target states generated by diagonalizing
the Hamiltonian in an N –function subspace of the La-
guerre basis. The limit N → ∞ gives the CC expansion
(15). The asymptotic form of the wave function is

The u(N )
are the L2 approximate target states and their
. Because the u(N )
energies are ǫ(N )
are L2 states the
scattering ﬂux for all the states is conﬁned to the strip
regions in Fig 1. Thus as it stands there is no ﬂux in the
ionization sector 0 < α < π
2 . In order to sensibly extract
an ionization amplitude from Eq. (20) one must make
an approximation that yields a true continuum function
for the positive–energy target states. The following is an
insert the completeness relation for
obvious possibility:

These amplitudes may be interpolated to provide the
(unsymmetric) CS(N )(CC)(ǫa, ǫb) which are then used to
construct the symmetrized amplitude (19).
It is this
amplitude that must be used in the unitarity relation
(14). Bray and Fursa [3] one the other hand argued that
the unsymmetric amplitudes must be summed incoher-
ently to satisfy unitarity, a suggestion that is equivalent

to treating the two electrons as distinguishable and the
integration is performed over the interval 0 ≤ ǫb ≤ E.
Bray further suggested [10] that in the limit N → ∞ the
CCC(N) amplitudes for E
2 < ǫb ≤ E would converge to
zero. This has also been criticized by BC and rebutted
by Bray [11]. We now give a speciﬁc example where the
distinguishable–electron hypothesis can be compared di-
rectly with coherent summation of identical-particle am-
plitudes.

Consider the letter of Bray [10] that reports CCC(N)
calculations for the TP singlet scattering model at
E=2Ryd. It is stated there that “ there is a clear lack
of convergence in going from 10 to 50 states”. However,
curiously, on inspection of his Fig. 2 [10] there appears
to be some convergence in the region of E
2 . We can use
the fact that the CCC(N) cross sections are convergent
there to extract a sequence of interpolated CCC(N) val-
ues for the E
2 cross section. In Table 1 we show the re-
sults obtained by a spline interpolation. The convergence
is apparent. The reason this energy is critical is that it
is the one energy where the symmetrized CC amplitude
(19) properly satisﬁes the boundary conditions of Eq.
(7). Thus the symmetrized amplitude leads directly to
a cross section proportional to 4|C0CCC(N )( E
2 )|2. In
the table are also shown the results of a very recent cal-
culation by Baertschy Rescigno and McCurdy [12] using
an exterior complex scaling method [13] that circumvents
the problem of matching to Coulomb ionization bound-
ary conditions. The result through use of the correctly
symmetrized CC amplitude is in good agreement with
their value. The symmetrized CC amplitude of course
is symmetric about E
2 . As we
move away from this energy on the assumption that the
neglect of logarithmic phase factors is a secondary eﬀect,
the cross section should move smoothly up from its min-
imum value. This is the behavior observed by Baertschy
et al [12].

2 and no step occurs at E

2 , E

Interestingly the the total ionization cross section ob-
tained by Baertschy et al is in excellent agreement with
the CCC predictions [14]. Using the symmetrized am-
plitude and integrating up to E
2 seems to lead to a very
similar answer as using incoherent summation and inte-
grating from 0 ≤ ǫb ≤ E. Thus all the features of the TP
model are explained by CCC theory provided one uses
a fully symmetrized ionization amplitude. In case it is
argued that the example chosen is fortuitous to our case,
we also analyzed the TP cross-section data presented by
Bartschat and Bray [15] at E=3Ryd. The results are
shown in Table 1. Again there is convergence to the
value of Baertschy et al.

Our conclusions are as follows. For CC methods in
general, the symmetrized expansion gives rise to ion-
ization scattering wave function asymptotic forms that
cannot be simply expressed as outgoing wave in hyper-
spherical coordinates multiplied by an amplitude unless
there are special circumstances. For TP triplet scatter-
ing one such special case arises in that CCC calculations
yield an unsymmetric amplitude that converges to zero

3

for ǫb > E
2 . In this case a symmetrized amplitude can
be made trivially. Thus if the TP CCC triplet scattering
calculations converge they must converge to the correct
model values and this is what is observed [12]. For TP
singlet scattering at the equal–energy–sharing kinemat-
ics, ǫb = ǫa = E
2 , the symmetrized CC amplitude satisﬁes
the correct ionization asymptotic form including loga-
rithmic phases. Using the converged unsymmetric sin-
glet CCC amplitudes to construct the symmetrized CC
cross section we get very good agreement with an inde-
pendent method of solution for the Temkin-Poet model.
These kinematics are ones where coherence of amplitudes
is maximal. The correct symmetrized singlet cross sec-
tion is therefore a factor of four larger than the value
from the raw CCC calculations. For asymmetric energy
kinematics the symmetrized amplitude will be very sim-
ilar to the published CCC calculations below E
2 because
the unsymmetric amplitudes above E
2 are small.

We make the following observation regarding Bray’s
step hypothesis. It is classical Fourier theory behaviour
that Fourier series which represent functions with steps,
converge, at the point of discontinuity, to the midpoint
of the step.
If the singlet CCC amplitude has such a
step, one might expect the amplitude to converge to the
midpoint at the step and the cross-section therefore to
one quarter of its step height. This is consistent with our
ﬁndings.

The conclusions regarding coherent summation of am-
plitudes may carry over to the full e–H and e–He prob-
lems. For example, it has been found that the CCC
results, after incoherent combination, at equal–energy–
sharing are typically a factor of two too low, i.e. a fac-
tor of four on the raw CCC results [16]. For asymmetric
kinematics it is likely that the CCC converges to the true
amplitudes contrary to the analysis of BC.

discussions and points of clariﬁcation regarding his work

lations. The support of the Australian Research Council

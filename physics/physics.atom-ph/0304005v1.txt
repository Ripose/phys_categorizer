Pairing of fermions in atomic traps and nuclei

H. Heiselberg
Univ. of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark

Pairing gaps for fermionic atoms in harmonic oscillator traps are calculated for a wide range of
interaction strengths and particle number, and compared to pairing in nuclei. Especially systems,
where the pairing gap exceeds the level spacing but is smaller than the shell splitting ¯hω, are stud-
ied which applies to most trapped Fermi atomic systems as well as to ﬁnite nuclei. When solving
the gap equation for a large trap with such multi-level pairing, one ﬁnds that the matrix elements
between nearby harmonic oscillator levels and the quasi-particle energies lead to a double logarithm
It is argued that neutron and
of the gap, and a pronounced shell structure at magic numbers.
proton pairing in nuclei belongs to the class of multi-level pairing, that their shell structure follows
naturally and that the gaps scale as ∼ A−1/3 - all in qualitative agreement with odd-even staggering
of nuclear binding energies. Pairing in large systems are related to that in the bulk limit. For large
nuclei the neutron and proton superﬂuid gaps approach the asymptotic value in inﬁnite nuclear
matter: ∆ ≃ 1.1 MeV.

I. INTRODUCTION

Pairing in fermi systems is central for understanding
superconductivity in condensed matter physics [1], super-
ﬂuidity and glitches in neutron stars, excitations spectra
and odd-even staggering of binding energies in nuclei [2],
metallic clusters [3] and superconducting grains [4], etc.
New insight into the general properties of such Fermi sys-
tems can now be obtained from experiments with atomic
gases [5] which recently have been cooled down to degen-
erate temperatures around 10% of the Fermi temperature
[6–8]. The interactions between trapped 6Li atoms have
simultaneously been tuned above a Feshbach resonance,
where they become strongly attractive, in order to pro-
duce optimal conditions for superﬂuidity. Atomic gases
have widely tunable number of particles, densities, in-
teraction strengths, temperatures, spin states, and other
parameters which holds great promise for a more general
understanding of pairing phenomena in solids, metallic
clusters, grains, nuclei and neutron stars.

In the experiments with 6Li atoms the anisotropic ex-
pansion after sudden release from the trap is as predicted
from hydrodynamics [9]. This is compatible both with a
strongly interacting superﬂuid and collisional hydrody-
namics. The scattering length is attractive a < 0 and
3 are achieved
large such that densities above ρ

and found mechanically stable towards collapse. The in-
teraction energy per particle scales like Fermi energy as
ρ2/3 [6–8] as predicted theoretically [10,11]. The super-
ﬂuid gaps in bulk are also expected to be of order the
Fermi energy.

In nuclear physics pairing is observed directly in the
odd-even staggering of binding energies, i.e., that nuclei
with an even number of protons or neutrons are more
strongly bound than nuclei with corresponding odd num-
bers by a pairing gap of order
1 MeV. The same pair-
ing gap also determines the excitation energies of ground

∼

state nuclei. On average the pairing energies in nuclei de-
crease with the number of protons and neutrons overlaid
with a distinct shell structure, i.e., they are smaller near
closed shells. It would be most interesting if the pairing
gaps of fermionic atoms harmonic oscillator traps dis-
play similar shell structure and scaling with the number
of particles as nuclei.

The object of this paper is to calculate pairing gaps
for ultracold atomic Fermi gases in harmonic oscillator
traps and draw comparisons to nuclei. We will show that
the pairing mechanism is similar for these systems in the
sense that both can to ﬁrst approximation be considered
as a ﬁnite system of fermions in a harmonic oscillator
ﬁeld with attractive delta function interactions. Another
important common feature is the anharmonic ﬁelds that
lead to splitting of the single particle states which re-
duce the pairing to the levels closest to the Fermi sur-
face and leads to a distinct shell structure. For a wide
range of interaction strengths and number of particles
the trapped atomic clouds are predicted to display sim-
ilar scaling and shell structure as nuclei. The similarity
between these systems allows us to calculate the contin-
uum or BCS limits for large traps and thereby estimate
the pairing gaps in nuclear matter, which also gives an
idea about those in neutron star matter.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II the ba-
sic properties of interacting fermions in harmonic oscil-
lator traps is given, in particular the single particle level
spectra. Pairing is reviewed in section III, with individual
subsections devoted to each pairing regime with special
emphasis on the novel multi-level pairing regime. After
discussing critical temperatures in the diﬀerent regimes,
we turn to nuclei and show that they belong to the class
of multi-level pairing. Finally, we discuss the advantages
of mixing fermi with bose atoms and give a summary.

II. DILUTE FERMI GASES IN H.O. TRAPS

We treat a gas of N fermionic atoms of mass m in a
harmonic oscillator (h.o.) potential at zero temperature
interacting via a two-body interaction with attractive s-
wave scattering length a < 0. We shall mainly discuss a
spherically symmetric trap and a dilute gas (i.e. where
the density ρ obeys ρ
1) of particles with two spin
states with equal population. The Hamiltonian is then
given by

actions below a critical value, G

The gap at the Fermi surface is of special interest. In
particular the one for half ﬁlled level (or shell) where
µ = ǫnF l and so EnF l = ∆nF l. We will in the following
refer to this gap as ∆

EnF l = ∆nF l.

The h.o. traps provide a physical system in which the
connection between these methods of pairing calculations
can be demonstrated and analytical results can be given
in various limits of interaction strength and particle num-
ber. The associated pairing regimes are displayed in Fig.
1 and will be discussed in the following subsections.

tively restored as compared to the SU (2) symmetry of

to as “SU (3)-pairing” or “super-pairing”. [13] We shall
calculate the gap by writing down the “super”-pair wave
function. As in single-level pairing, however, we obtain
the same result by solving the gap equation.

and (10) or, equivalently, to N <
∼
For more than two particles in the shell we may again
invoke the seniority scheme.
It applies approximately
to many superpairs when the single-level gap is replaced
by the supergap G, and the level degeneracy for a full
h.o. shell Ω = (nF + 1)(nF + 2). Numerical calculations
for half ﬁlled shells conﬁrms that the pairing energy per
particle is given by the supergap for single-shell pairing
[14].

The single-shell pair energy spectrum does, however,
diﬀer from that for single-level pairing.
In the latter
case, one can generally write the pairing wave function in
Eq. (14) as any linear combination of the time-reversed
two-particle states ψlm(r1)ψl−m(r2). Due to rotational
SO(3) symmetry the overlap integrals in a single-level
are independent of m and the spectrum of pairing ener-
gies is particularly simple: one state with 2EnF l as given

by Eqs.(17-19) and rest of the (2l + 1) states has zero
energy per pair. In the shell, however, the overlap be-
tween the radial wave functions depend on l and l′ the
corresponding matrix for l, l′ = nF , nF −
2, ..., 1 or 0 has
2G/(2S + 1),
a non-trivial eigen-value spectrum: ES ≃
1 [19]. The cor-
S = 0, 1, ..., Int((nF + 1)/2), when nF ≫
responding eigen-vectors αl are very well approximated
by Chebyshev’s polynomia as function of x = (l/nF )2 in
the large nF limit. Consequently, the excitation energy
of a pair is only 2/3 of the energy 2G that it takes to
break the pair completely. The richer spectrum is im-
portant for expressing an eﬀective Hamiltonian for BCS
pairing.

C. Multi-shell pairing

For increasing interaction strength pairing also take
place between diﬀerent shells, i.e. n
= nF contributes
in the sum over n in the gap equation (11). The pair-
ing strength ∆n depends only weakly on n for the shells
around n = nF which mainly contribute to the pairing
∆nF . For half ﬁlled

formed between states within the same shell. However,
there is pairing in many shells besides that at the Fermi
level yielding a gap signiﬁcantly larger than ∆ = G.

For a large system the local superﬂuid ﬁeld is related
to that in a uniform system. In the TF approximation

region. For that reason the low lying single particle exci-
tations [21,14] and the collective modes are surface modes
¯hω [22]. For
with typical excitation energies of order
example, the lowest s-wave excitation (the monopole) is
ω0 = 2ω in the collisionless limit. This is contrast to the
weakly interacting system, i.e. below the bulk superﬂu-
idity region of Fig.1, where ω0 = ∆ for open shells. We
refer to Ref. [14,22] for a discussion of such modes.

∼

Here, we concentrate on the bulk superﬂuid ﬁeld inside
the trap and will relate it to that in a uniform system.
Contrary to the surface states, the excitations at higher
energies are less aﬀected by the pairing ﬁeld and the
Bogoliubov wave functions are approximately given by
the unperturbed h.o. wave functions. Consequently, the
intra-shell paring condition discussed in Ref. [14], which
leads to the gap equations (11) and (23), are approx-
imately valid for these states. However, the gap is to

pairing take place between multiple (l, l′) levels lying

referred as multi-level pairing. This region overlaps into
the regions studied in the above subsections and therefore
applies to most systems of trapped fermions except traps
with very few (single-shell), very many (single-level) or
strongly interacting fermions (multi-shell). As we shall
see below nuclei can also be considered to belong to the
multi-level regime.

For large level splitting D

∆ the detailed structure
of the overlap integrals in Eq. (11) becomes important.
We shall calculate these analytically using WKB as well
as numerically from the exact h.o. radial wave functions.
Inserting the latter in the gap equation we calculate the
pairing gaps as shown in Figs. 2+3 for half ﬁlled levels,
i.e., for µ = εnF l, where EnF l = ∆nF l = ∆.

The multi-level gap of Eq. (30) is quite robust and ap-
plies to many systems as long as G>
∆. Its validity
∼
for nuclei will be discussed below. The formula for the
multi-level gap can be generalized by relating the shell
splitting to the density of states at the Fermi surface as
∂n/∂ǫ = Ω/D, where Ω = n2
F is the number of states
in the shell. Likewise, the supergap is related to the
coupling constant as G
gΩ. If the level spectrum of
Eq. (8) is changed, the multi-level gap therefore remains
valid, if the shell splitting is correspondingly scaled with
the level density. In other words the double log does not
depend on the details of the level spectrum but is generic
for systems like h.o. traps, because the one log is asso-
ciated with the overlap matrix elements between nearby
states and the other is associated with the quasiparticle
energy in the gap equation. The details of the level spec-
trum only aﬀects the parameters α(x) and β(x) as long
as the pairing take place over several levels but not all
states in the Fermi og neighboring shells contribute.

∝

The appearance of a double log is not unique for multi-
level pairing but also occurs in the case of color supercon-
ductivity in quark matter [23]. The physical mechanism
behind is, however, diﬀerent. Within perturbative QCD
the singular quark-quark interaction gQCD/q2, where q
is the momentum transfer carried by a gluon, is dynam-
ically screened by Landau damping. When the interac-
tion is integrated over momentum and energy transfer,
the dynamical screening leads to a logarithm of the gap.
Thus it is the interactions that are responsible for the
second logarithm and not the wave function overlap of
nearby states as in the h.o. trap.

IV. CRITICAL TEMPERATURES

The pairing gaps generally decrease with increasing
temperature from its zero temperature value ∆(T = 0),
that was calculated above, to the critical temperature Tc,
where it vanishes. The temperature dependence of the

That Tc/∆(T = 0) = γ/π as in the uniform Fermi gas is

logarithmic order.

ically to the value 1/2 found in the single-shell, single-
level and multi-shell regimes, the diﬀerence reveals the
qualitative diﬀerences in the underlying level spectrum,
namely, continuous vs. discrete respectively.

V. PAIRING IN NUCLEI

The nuclear mean ﬁeld is often approximated by a sim-
ple h.o.
form and the residual eﬀective pairing interac-
tion by a delta force in order to obtain some qualitative
insight into single particle levels, pairing, collective mo-
tion, etc., (see, e.g., [15,18]). We can therefore compare
pairing in nuclei to that in traps as investigated above,
once the h.o. potential is adjusted to describe nuclei. We
emphasize that we do not intend to calculated the quan-
titative pairing gaps for each individual nucleus which
would require detailed knowledge of the individual level
spectra, deformation, many-body eﬀects, etc. Instead we
aim at qualitative results for the pairing gap dependence
on mass number, shell eﬀects, and to extrapolate to very
large nuclei, nuclear and neutron star matter.

Large nuclei have approximately constant central den-
0.14 fm−3 and Fermi energy EF in bulk.

Therefore the h.o.
frequency, which is ﬁtted to the nu-

In the valley of β-stability the number of protons is Z

Secondly, the nuclear mean ﬁeld deviates from a h.o.
potential by being almost constant inside the nucleus and
vanish outside. The resulting net anharmonic nuclear
ﬁeld is stronger and opposite in sign to the corresponding
(anharmonic) mean ﬁeld in atomic traps. Therefore, the
level splitting is larger and the ordering of the l-levels
is reversed. In addition, a strong spin-orbit force splits
the single particle states of total angular momentum j =

but of order the average splitting between to adjacent
j-levels. Consequently, nuclei can be considered as h.o.
traps with a level splitting D such that they fall into the
multi-level pairing regime. However, the number of par-
ticles in nuclei is relatively small that nuclei are close to
the single shell pairing regime. Furthermore, the interac-
tions are so strong that multi-shell pairing also becomes
important. From the results of Sec. III we can predict
several features of neutron and proton pairing gaps:

are split and the j = nF + 1/2 is lowered down
to the shell below. The magic numbers become

Bulk limit for large nuclei/nuclear matter:
For very large nuclei multi-shell pairing becomes
important and pairing approaches that in bulk mat-
ter. By ﬁtting the eﬀective nucleon coupling con-
stant to pairing gaps in ﬁnite nuclei we will be-
low estimate the pairing in nuclear matter from Eq.
(25).

These predictions agree qualitatively with experimental
data (see Figs. 4+5).

For a more quantitative calculation the level spectrum
must be speciﬁed. In stead of ﬁtting the level spectrum
for each nucleus with a correspondingly large number of
adjustable parameters, we make the following simplifying
approximation

The level splitting is approximated by D = 0.13(nF +
3/2)¯hω in analogy with Eq. (10) and based on nuclear
structure calculations, which generally ﬁnd that the level
splitting increase with shell number and is of order D
≃
6). The spin-orbit splitting
¯hω for heavy nuclei (nF ∼
and change in magic numbers are incorporated to ﬁrst
approximation by simply moving the lowest level in each
shell down to the shell below, i.e., D = ¯hω for j = nF +
1/2.

The pairing gaps and quasi-particle energies can now
be calculated by solving the gap equation inserting the
h.o. matrix elements and with ¯hω and level splitting as
given by Eqs. (35) and (36). The eﬀective strength a is
then the only adjustable parameter.

The data on neutron and proton pairing is obtained
from the odd-even staggering of nuclear binding energies
B(N, Z). It has been shown that mean ﬁeld contributions
can be removed [25] by using the three-point ﬁlter

The total binding energies are elaborate sums over
quasi-particle energies weighted with occupation num-
bers. Mean ﬁeld energies and single particle energies
should also be included self consistently. Furthermore,
the Bogoliubov transformation does not preserve exact
particle number and does not treat a single un-paired
particle that appears in odd-number systems. For these
reasons we cannot calculate ∆(3) directly.
Instead we
will for simplicity compare to the gaps ∆nF l which are
calculated directly from the gap equation as function
of µ(N, Z). The validity of this approximation for odd
particle numbers has been discussed elsewhere (see, e.g.
[25]).

The pairing gaps are sensitive to the shell splitting and
the coupling. The uncertainty in the coupling is smaller

because the changes in D aﬀects both the exponent and
the prefactor in the gap of Eq. (30) in a compensating
way. Another uncertainty arise from the upper cutoﬀ.
Whereas h.o. traps can pair between shells up to
2nF ,
nuclei have a continuum of states about one shell above
the Fermi level. Therefore the sum over shells in the gap
equation has been limited to n <
nF + 1 with a smooth
∼
cutoﬀ as in Ref. [27].

∼

Considering the simplicity of the model it describes a
large number of experimental gaps fairly well on average.
In a number of cases, however, the calculated pairing
gaps diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the measured neutron gaps.
Some of these deviations can be attributed to the crude
single particle level spectra assumed. If the single particle
level energies are adjusted according to more detailed
mean ﬁeld calculations (see, e.g., [15]) the agreement with
experimental pairing gaps improves in several cases.

Nuclei can also be deformed around mid-shell which in-
crease pairing [25]. These and other nuclear many-body
eﬀects must be included in a more quantitative study of
pairing in individual nuclei. For this purpose it will be
useful also to study pairing in elongated atomic traps
with deformations like in nuclei. Near closed shells pair-
ing reduce or inhibit deformations. The eﬀect of pairing
is also observed in rotational spectra where the moment
of inertia is reduced from the rigid to superﬂuid or irro-
tational value [15]. In traps the external h.o. potential
generally dominates over the mean ﬁeld interaction en-
ergy and thus does not deform spontaneously [28] as in
nuclei - unless of course if the h.o. ﬁeld itself is deformed.
Nucleon pairing gaps depend empirically on mass num-

then the multi-level gap of Eq. (30) would also scale as

the multi-level gap decrease faster with A for small and

VI. BOSON-FERMION MIXTURES

There is a number of advantages by mixing fermionic
and bosonic atoms. Firstly, it allows rapid thermalization
and cooling as scattering processes involving bosons are
not inhibited by Pauli Blocking which suppress fermion-
(T /EF )2. Secondly, induced in-
fermion scatterings
teractions between fermions and bosons enhance pairing
for both attractive and repulsive fermi-bose interactions
[20]. Thirdly, by varying the number of bosons NB and
possibly also their interactions with the fermions, one
can eﬀectively vary D in a controlled way as we will now
discuss in more detail.

∼

The density of fermions depends mainly on the number
of fermions in the trap as given by Eq. (5) because Pauli
blocking enhance particle kinetic energies over interac-
tion energies. The density of bosons is, however, very
sensitive to the interactions. For a trap with bosonic
atoms only with repulsive interactions aBB > 0, the

In a mixture of bosons and fermions the boson and
fermion densities can be determined within TF from the
Kohn-Sham energy-density functional theory. They will
generally depend on the number of bosons and fermions
and their interactions strengths, gF F , gF B, gBB. In the
dilute limit the harmonic part of the fermion density
is only slightly changed, f.ex., RT F = √2nF aosc(1 +

The additional mean ﬁeld from the bosons: UF B =

length and the boson density, which again depends both
on all interaction strengths and the density of fermions.
The general case is very complex and we will therefore

standard case unless the bosons dominate in number and
interaction strengths. Thus the cloud of bosons will be
small as compared to that of fermions and they will
mainly aﬀect the l
nF states depending on the sign of
gF B. A repulsive boson-fermion interaction as, e.g. be-
tween 6Li and 7Li atoms will thus decrease D and thereby
increase the pairing gaps and favor superﬂuidity. Alter-
natively, an attractive boson-fermion interaction as, e.g.
between 41K and 87Rb atoms will increase D and thereby
decrease the pairing gap. The larger level spacing will, as
was discussed in the previous section, represent a system
more like nuclei because the multi-level pairing regime is
reached with much fewer fermions in the (more anhar-
monic) trap.

VII. SUMMARY

Pairing gaps have been calculated for ultracold atomic
Fermi gases in harmonic oscillator traps and compared to
nuclei. The pairing mechanism was found to be similar
for these systems in the sense that the spacing between
single particle states (and shells) reduce the pairing over
several of these levels near the Fermi surface referred to
as multi-level pairing. A double log generally appeared
in the gap equation; one from the quasiparticle energy
and the other from the overlap matrix elements between
neighbouring l-levels in the h.o. shell, resulting in the
multi-level gap of Eq. (30). The pairing mechanism in
traps and nuclei diﬀers from standard treatments by the
nontrivial (double log) overlap matrix elements between
nearby l-levels, by the sensitivity to the shell splitting,
and by the multi-shell pairing to remote h.o. shells.

At low particle densities the shell structures in traps
are pronounced as they are in nuclei and the level de-
generacies are important for the size of the gaps which
can diﬀer substantially from those known from homo-
geneous systems [20] and systems with continuous level

densities. For nuclei the average pairing gaps were found
A−1/3 as
to scale with mass number approximately as
predicted from the supergap. Contributions from multi-
shell pairing are partly compensated by a shell-splitting
growing with mass number. The shell splitting lead to
a shell structure that is qualitatively in agreement with
that expected from multi-level pairing. Eventually for
large mass number the gap approaches the value in uni-
form nuclear matter.

∼

For a wide range of interaction strengths and num-
ber of particles the trapped atomic clouds display sim-
ilar scaling and shell structure as nuclei. This allowed
us to extract the eﬀective nucleon-nucleon pairing delta
function interaction and thus to extrapolate to the con-
tinuum limits of nuclear matter as for large traps and
there estimate a 1S0 superﬂuid gap of ∆
1.1 MeV for
both neutrons and protons.

≃

The critical temperatures are proportional to the zero
temperature gap with a prefactor of 1/2 for trapped
atoms with pronounced discrete level structure but with
a prefactor γ/π = 0.567.. in bulk systems or systems with
multi-level pairing, which have a continuous level density
near the Fermi level.

Finally, the advantages of mixing fermi with bose
atoms was discussed. Bosons improve cooling to lower
temperatures so that weak pairing can also be studied,
and the additional induced interactions between fermions
and bosons generally enhance pairing. Furthermore, the
shell splitting can be changed in a controlled way by the
number of bosons in the trap and the sign and strength
of their interaction with the fermions.

The similarity of multi-level and bulk pairing in atomic
traps and nuclei may provide new insight into pairing
and superﬂuidity in nuclei and neutron star matter from
tabletop experiments at low temperatures.

(nF + 3/2)2 − l(l + 1)]a2

[12] The WKB approximation: Rnl(r) ∝ sin(k(r)r +
θ)/k(r)1/2r, can be applied between the turning points
r2
osc. Near the
± = [nF + 3/2 ±
turning points the wave functions must be replaced by
Airy functions for detailed gap calculations. The phase θ
is only important to leading log order when l = 0 where
θ = 0. When the wave function has many nodes 1 ≪ l ≪
nF , the oscillations can be averaged hsin2(kr)i = 1/2 and
hsin4(kr)i = 3/8.

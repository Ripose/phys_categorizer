We conﬁne 4

108 fermionic 6Li atoms simultaneously
109 bosonic 7Li atoms in a magneto-optical trap
with 9
based on an all-semiconductor laser system. We optimize
the two-isotope sample for sympathetic evaporative cool-
ing. This is an essential step towards the production of a
quantum-degenerate gas of fermionic lithium atoms.

PACS: 32.80.Pj

The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in
atomic vapors [1] has made dilute bosonic quantum
gases experimentally accessible and the study of these
systems has since been very fruitful. Quantum degen-
erate gases of neutral fermionic atoms such as 6Li or
40K have so far not been studied experimentally. At
temperatures below the Fermi temperature in such
systems energy and momentum transfer is modiﬁed
by Fermi statistics [2,3]. One striking example would
be the partial suppression of spontaneous emission in
an atomic Fermi gas [4]. Also, a Fermi gas of neutral
atoms in a mixture of diﬀerent hyperﬁne (HF) states
might undergo a BCS pairing transition and exhibit
long range coherence and superﬂuid behavior [5]. It
could give access to phenomena so far only observed in
strongly interacting Fermi systems such as atomic nu-
clei, the quantum liquid 3He and degenerate electron
gases.

Evaporative cooling of polarized atoms is so far
essential for the production of quantum degenerate
gases [6]. It is driven by elastic collisions. At ultra-low
temperature T , i.e. below a few millikelvin for lithium,
collisions between bosons or distinguishable particles
are predominantly s-wave collisions while Pauli exclu-
sion prohibits s partial-waves of polarized fermions.
In an ultra-cold gas of indistinguishable fermions the
elastic collision rate diminishes proportional to T −2
which has recently been conﬁrmed by De Marco et al.
for 40K [7]. Fermionic atoms can be cooled sympathet-
ically by collisions in a mixture of diﬀerent internal
states [8,7] or of diﬀerent species, yet to be imple-
mented.

We intend to sympathetically cool fermionic 6Li
with the bosonic 7Li isotope. This could produce not
only a quantum degenerate Fermi gas but also a Bose-
Einstein condensate of 7Li in both HF ground states
as well as a mixture of quantum degenerate gases of
fermions and bosons [9]. One can also employ ultra-
cold bosons to probe collisional properties of a degen-
erate Fermi gas [3].

Previously several groups have studied samples of
two atomic species in a magneto-optical trap (MOT)

[11]. In this article we describe the ﬁrst realization of
a MOT containing both fermionic and bosonic lithium
108
and its optimization for sympathetic cooling. 4
6Li atoms and 9
109 7Li atoms are simultaneously
conﬁned. These numbers together with the density
and temperature achieved should be suﬃcient to pro-
duce a Fermi gas with a Fermi temperature on the or-
der of 10 µK in a harmonic magnetic trap of frequency
ω/2π = 400 s−1. The phase space density
= n0Λ3/f
of unpolarized atoms (f internal states) with a peak
density n0 and temperature T is the number of iden-
tical atoms per cubic thermal DeBroglie wave length
/mkBT )1/2. The achieved phase space den-
Λ = (2π¯h

sity in the two-isotope magneto-optical trap is 4
10−6 for 6Li(f = 2). In sin-
for 7Li(f = 3) and 0.8

gle isotope traps, the number of fermions( 1.5
exceeds the best previous realization of laser-cooled
fermions by more than one order of magnitude [7].
The number of trapped 7Li (1.8
1010) is also a fac-
tor of 10 improvement [10].

In future experiments, this two isotope sample
will be polarized and transferred into a magnetic
trap. Bosonic lithium will be evaporatively cooled.
Fermionic lithium thermalizes with the bosons via
elastic collisions. Neglecting inelastic losses, all ini-
tially conﬁned fermions should reach the quantum de-
generate regime. In eﬃcient evaporative cooling the

atoms into the quantum degenerate regime (
We therefore aim to maximize the number N of 7Li
atoms in the two-isotope trap while simultaneously
conﬁning at least N/100 6Li atoms. It is equally cru-
cial that atoms thermalize quickly during the trap
lifetime. Thus the initial elastic collision rate Γi be-
tween 7Li atoms in the mode-matched and compressed
magnetic trap must be maximized. For a linear trap-
ping potential in three dimensions Γi can be related
to quantities of the MOT as follows:

exp(
−
laser-cooled sample of 7Li with respect to Γi in pres-
ence of 6Li.

In the experiment, the MOT is loaded from a Zee-
man slowed lithium beam. 6Li in the beam is enriched
and has an abundance of about 20 %. Both isotopes

→

are slowed and conﬁned in the MOT with 671 nm light
near resonant with the D2 line, the 2S1/2
2P3/2
optical transition. The isotopic shift for this transi-
tion is 10 GHz. Each isotope requires two frequencies
to excite from the two HF ground states. The HF
splitting is 803.5 MHz for 7Li and 228.2 MHz for 6Li.
Hence simultaneous laser cooling of both lithium iso-
topes requires eight diﬀerent laser frequencies:
four
frequencies for Zeeman slowing and four frequencies
for magneto-optical trapping as shown in Fig. 1.

All

frequencies are derived with acousto-optical
modulators
from two grating-stabilized external-
cavity diode lasers based on 30 mW laser diodes. The
lasers are frequency locked in saturated absorption to
the D2-lines of 6Li and 7Li respectively. The slowing
light is produced by geometrical superposition of the
output of four injection seeded 30 mW laser diodes.
Four trapping frequency components are geometri-
cally superposed and 15 mW of this light is injected
into a tapered semiconductor ampliﬁer chip. After
spatial ﬁltering the chip produces up to 140 mW of
trapping light containing the four frequency compo-
nents in a gaussian mode at identical polarization as
described in [12]. The intensity ratio of the frequency
components in the trapping beams can be adjusted.
This light is split up into six independent gaussian
trapping beams, each with maximum peak intensity
of Imax = 6 mW/cm2, a 1/e2 intensity width of 3 cm
and an apertured diameter of 2 cm. The MOT is oper-
ated in a 4 cm
10 cm Vycor glass cell of optical
quality λ/2. Background gas collisions limit the 1/e
MOT lifetime τ to about 25 s.

The trapped atom clouds of both isotopes are sep-
arately observed in absorption imaging. For observa-
tion the trapping light and magnetic ﬁeld are switched
oﬀ abruptly. The induction limited 1/e decay time of
the magnetic ﬁeld is less than 50 µs. After free ballistic
expansion with an adjustable time-of-ﬂight between
150 µs and 7 ms the sample is illuminated for 80 µs by
a probe beam. This probe excites either 7Li from the
F=2 ground state or 6Li from the F=3/2 ground state
to the 2P3/2 excited state manifold. The absorption
shadow of the sample is imaged onto a charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera. A separate repumping beam
which is not projected onto the camera excites atoms
in the other HF ground state to avoid optical pump-
ing. The density distribution, atom number and tem-
perature of the sample are obtained from absorption
images for diﬀerent ballistic expansion times.

Both isotopes are magneto-optically trapped in two
steps: In the ﬁrst step, the loading phase, the capture
volume and velocity of the trap is large such that the
number of trapped atoms is maximized. In the sec-
ond step, the compression phase, the already trapped
atoms are compressed in phase space such that the
initial elastic collision rate Γi is maximized.

All four frequencies νP 7, νR7, νP 6 and νR6 of the
MOT are exciting on the D2-line. We maximized
the number of 7Li atoms and 6Li atoms in separate

MOTs as well as the number of 7Li atoms in the two-
isotope trap. The maximization involved the detun-
ings δP 7, δR7, δP 6, δR6 of the light components from
the cooling and repumping transitions of the two iso-
topes (Fig.1), the intensities of all frequency compo-
nents and the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld of the
MOT.

1010 7Li atoms and 1.5

First, the atom number in separate single-isotope
MOTs with only the two frequencies for the respec-
tive isotope present was optimized. We were able to
109 6Li
capture up to 1.8
atoms. The atom number N , peak density n0, tem-
perature T and the respective detunings are listed in
Tab.I. The atom number is accurate to within a fac-
tor of 2 and this dominates the uncertainty in the
density determination. The temperature uncertainty
is 0.2 mK. For both isotopes the atom number is max-
imized at large frequency detunings and equal inten-
sities in both frequency components. The optimum
magnetic ﬁeld gradient B′ along the symmetry axis of
the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld of the MOT is about
35 G/cm for both isotopes. The MOT was operated
at maximum intensity Imax = 6 mW/cm2 in each of
the six beams.

In the 7Li trap, at low atom number (

109) the
temperature is the Doppler temperature (1.1 mK at
8Γ), as shown in Fig 2. At large atom num-

by loss due to inelastic radiative escape (RE) or ﬁne

the MOT. The two-body loss coeﬃcient β = 6
×
10−13 cm3/s was experimentally determined and is
consistent with previous studies of trap loss in a 7Li
MOT [13].

In 7Li the HF splitting between the F′=3 and the
F′=2 excited states is 1.6 Γ and in 6Li, 0.5 Γ between
the F′=5/2 and the F′=3/2 excited states, where
Γ = 5.9 MHz is the natural width of the lithium D-
lines. Despite the inverted excited state HF structure
of both lithium isotopes, the small HF splitting leads
F′=2 transi-
to oﬀ-resonant excitation of the F=2
F′=3/2 transition in 6Li
tion in 7Li, and the F=3/2
and frequent decay into the lower HF ground state.
The repumping light component is therefore of equal
importance as the principal trapping light. In fact, we
only obtained a MOT with the repumping light also in
a six-beam MOT conﬁguration. This is not required
in MOTs of other alkalis with larger HF splitting, such
as Cs, Na or Rb.

For the two-isotope trap, the 6Li repumping transi-
F′=3/2 is about 7(3) Γ to the blue of the

F′=1 resonance in the D1 line of 7Li. If both
F=2
lithium isotopes are simultaneously conﬁned, the 6Li
repumping light component νR6 frequently excites this
non-cooling transition and signiﬁcantly weakens the
conﬁnement of the trap for 7Li. This leads to smaller
number of trapped 7Li atoms in the presence of 6Li
light. We reduce this harmful eﬀect by detuning to-
wards the D1 resonance while reducing the intensity.
The coincidence could also be avoided by repumping
6Li on the D1 line instead. Aside from the light in-
duced trap loss we do not observe mutual eﬀects due
to the presence of both isotopes (such as collision in-
duced trap loss, heating or a modiﬁcation of the spa-
tial distribution).

As discussed in the introduction, for eﬃcient sym-
pathetic cooling in subsequent stages of the experi-
ment we require about 100 times less precooled 6Li
atoms than 7Li atoms. We decrease the intensity of
6Li light in the two-isotope trap in order to reduce the
7Li trap loss. This maximizes the number of 7Li atoms
at the cost of less 6Li atoms. We are able to conﬁne
108 6Li atoms.

This result was obtained with an intensity relation
between the four frequency components νP 1, νR1, νP 2
and νR2 of 8 : 8 : 2 : 1 and a magnetic ﬁeld gradient
B′ = 35 G/cm. N , n0, T and the respective detunings
for the two-isotope MOT are listed in Tab. I.

After loading the trap it is possible to further com-
press the sample in phase space and maximize the
initial elastic collision rate Γi by changing the laser
parameters for the duration of a few milliseconds.
From Eq.1 follows that in case of no loss of atoms
during compression a maximization of Γi also maxi-
Di. For the compression, we optimize Γi with
mizes
respect to the total laser intensity and the frequency
detunings δP 6, δP 7, δR6, δR7 while keeping B′ con-
stant at 35 G/cm. We compress the single-isotope
MOTs as well as the two-isotope sample. For sym-
pathetic cooling we are especially interested in maxi-
mizing Γi for 7Li in the presence of 6Li. As shown in
Tab. II, decreasing δR7, i. e. detuning νP 7 further to
the red of the transition, and increasing δP 7 towards
resonance while reducing the overall laser intensity to
0.3 Imax=1.8 mW/cm2 results in a 40% drop in tem-
perature and increases the density by 70 %. 30 % of
the initially conﬁned atoms are lost during the ﬁrst
3 ms of compression. This loss is either due to FS- and
RE-collision induced heating during the initial com-
pression stage or due to a loss of parts of the cloud as
a consequence of an abrupt change of laser frequencies
(see Fig. 3). According to Eq.1 compression increases
Γi by 60%. After compressing the two-isotope trap
109 7Li atoms
for 3 ms, we obtain a maximum of 6
×
1011 cm−3 and a temperature
at a peak density of 4
×
of 0.6 mK together with 6Li at a density 6.5
1010
cm−3 and a temperature of 0.7 mK. Aside from the
initial loss during the ﬁrst few milliseconds, the 1/e
trap lifetime also decreases to about 30 ms for both
isotopes.

×

Fig.3 shows the typical temporal dynamics of atom
number, width and temperature of the 7Li compressed
MOT (CMOT) for the ﬁrst 6.5 ms of compression.
Γi and
Di reach a maximum after about 3 ms. The
CMOT is rather insensitive to the repumping fre-
quency νR7: detuning by 2 Γ above and below the op-
timized value of 5.8 Γ decreases Γi by less than 25%.
The CMOT is much more sensitive to the detuning
νP 7 of the trapping light. We optimized Γi with re-
spect to the duration t of the compression phase and
the detuning. The maxima of Γi and
Di remain at a
constant value for t
3 ms but shift to diﬀerent de-
tuning parameters with increasing CMOT duration.

To summarize, we showed that it is possible to trap
108 6Li
109 7Li atoms together with 3
about 6
atoms in the two-isotope MOT at at phase space den-
10−6. These results are comparable to re-
sities of
sults achieved with single isotopes of Na or Cs in a
dark SPOT [14]. In combination with a strong con-
ﬁning magnetic trap we expect an initial elastic col-
lision rate well above 10 s−1, despite the small triplet
scattering length of 1.4 nm (7Li-7Li) and 2.0 nm (6Li-
7Li) [15]. This can lead to the production of quantum
degenerate Bose and Fermi gases of lithium by forced
evaporation and sympathetic cooling within a few sec-
onds.

Abstract

A general expression for the diﬀerential cross section of dielectronic recombination (DR) of

polarized electrons and polarized ions is derived by using usual atomic theory methods and is

represented in the form of multiple expansions over spherical tensors. The ways of the applica-

tion of the general expressions suitable for the speciﬁc experimental conditions are outlined by

deriving asymmetry parameters of angular distribution of DR radiation in the case of nonpolar-

ized and polarized ions and electrons.

1. Introduction

Dielectronic recombination (DR) and electron impact excitation are the basic excitation

mechanisms of x-ray production from high temperature plasmas. For the case of non-equilibrium,

anisotropic plasmas, the polarization and angular distribution of radiation can be useful for the

investigation of the properties of electron distribution function and plasma diagnostics [1]. In

tokamak an other laboratory devices, the highly charged ions can be aligned [1, 2], therefore the

expression for DR cross section describing the polarization state of ions and electrons in the initial

state and radiation in the ﬁnal state are of importance. The alignment of the doubly excited

state, i.e. a non-uniform occupation of magnetic sublevels, causes the anisotropic emission of a

photon relative to the direction of an incident ion beam [3]. The values of calculated DR cross

section for various directions can change up to several tens of percent when the anisotropy of

DR radiation is taken into account [4].

Density matrix formalism [5] is the usual method for the derivation of the expressions for

the diﬀerential cross sections of DR of polarized ions with polarized electrons [4, 5]. Recently

in the case of fully relativistic treatment, the expression for the diﬀerential cross section of DR

was derived [3] by using a projection operator formalism [6]. The aim of the present work is the

derivation of general expression in nonrelativistic approximation for the diﬀerential cross section

of DR process by applying alternative method based on the atomic theory methods [7, 8, 9, 10].

The polarization state of all particles in both the initial and ﬁnal states are described in this

approximation. The practical applications of the general expression for the speciﬁc experimental

conditions are outlined. The expression for the asymmetry parameter of the angular distribution

of radiation in DR of non-polarized and aligned ions with non-polarized and polarized electrons

demonstrates the way of the derivation of more simple expressions.

2. General expression

The process of DR can be written as follows

−
A+(α0J0M0) + e

(pm)

∗∗

(α1J1)

A(α2J2M2) + hν(ǫq, k0),

→ (

A+(α3J3M3) + e−(p1m1).

It is an example of two-step process. The ﬁrst step is resonant electron capture that is inverse

process to Auger decay. The next step is radiative or Auger decay those expressions for the

diﬀerential probability were obtained [12, 13] in the case of orientated and aligned ions following

photoionization of atoms. Two-step approximation for DR may be applied if the interference

with the radiative recombination is neglected and the summation over intermediate states J1M1,

that usually occurs in second-order perturbation theory, is limited to a single resonance. Then,

only a summation over the magnetic substates that are not registered is retained. DR process

is ﬁnished when the photon is emitted.

In two-step approximation, the cross section for DR may be written as:

dσ(α0J0M0pm

Here H ′ and H e is the radiative decay and electrostatic interaction operators, respectively, dΩ

is the solid angle of the emission of radiation, E1 and E is the energy of the intermediate and

initial state of the system atom+electron, respectively, and Γ denotes the decay width of the

intermediate state that includes both radiative and nonradiative decay channels. In (2), ρi and

ρf denote the ﬂux of incoming electrons and the density of ﬁnal states, respectively. Atomic

system of units is used.

In two step approximation (E

described in [10, 12] and is as follows:

3. Special cases

The tensor (5) describes the orientation of the angular momentum with respect to the lab-

oratory z axis. In the case of the magnetic components are not registered, the summation over

them of (5) leads to δ(K, 0)δ(N, 0). Thus, to obtain the expression of DR cross section describ-

ing angular distribution of radiation in the case of nonpolarized ions and electrons, one needs

to insert K0 = N0 = Ks = Ns = K2 = N2 = 0 and K1 = Kλ = K = Kr = even into (4).

Taking into account the z axis coinciding with the direction of electrons (N1 = 0) we can write

DR cross section in well known form [11]:

In the case of electrical dipole radiation, k = k′ = 1, and the expression for β2 coincides with

(9) from [11].

To obtain an expression for the dependence of angular distribution of DR radiation on the

polarization state of ions we need to perform summation of (4) over m =

1/2 states of the

±

electron and M2 of the ﬁnal state of recombined ion that lead to Ks = Ns = K2 = N2 = 0,

Kλ = K = even, K1 = Kr. The choice of the laboratory z axis along the direction of electrons
gives Nλ = 0 because of YKλNλ(0, 0) = [(2Kλ + 1)/4π]1/2δ(Nλ, 0). Then

In the case when the ﬁnal state of an ion is not registered and laboratory z axis chosen along

the direction of incoming electrons, the expression for DR of nonpolarized ions with polarized

electrons can be obtained by averaging with respect of magnetic states of ion and summation

over M2 of (4). Then K0 = N0 = K2 = N2 = 0, K1 = K = Kr, Nλ = 0, and

4. Concluding remarks

The general expression for DR diﬀerential cross section of polarized ions and polarized elec-

trons is obtained in two-step approximation. It is presented in the form of the multipole ex-

pansions over the states of all particles participating in the process that is very convenient for

investigations, since the geometrical and dynamical parts are separated. This form coincides

with that of the expansion over state multipoles (statistical tensors) widely used in the density

matrix formalism. A simple way to derive the expressions for the special cases by using the

general expression for the DR is described. The expressions for the asymmetry parameter of

the angular distribution of radiation is obtained in the case of DR of nonpolarized atoms with

nonpolarized and polarized electrons.

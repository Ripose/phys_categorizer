The ground state energies and pairing gaps in dilute superﬂuid Fermi gases have now been cal-
culated with the quantum Monte Carlo method without detailed knowledge of their wave function.
However, such knowledge is essential to predict other properties of these gases such as density ma-
trices and pair distribution functions. We present a new and simple method to optimize the wave
functions of quantum liquids using Green’s function Monte Carlo method. It is used to calculate the
pair distribution and the potential energies of gas at various values of akF including ±∞. PACS:

Recent progress in experimental [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and
theoretical methods [7, 8, 9, 10] have generated great
interest in the properties of dilute Fermi superﬂuid gases.
Such gases are also of interest in studies of astrophysical
objects such as neutron stars [11] and in nuclear physics
[12].

Usually the dimensionless quantity 1/akF is used to
characterize the interparticle interaction where a is s-
wave scattering length. When the interaction is weak
and attractive, we have a superﬂuid gas with gap ∆ ∼
eπ/(2akF )
It has

we have tightly bound molecules with energy Emol and
E0/N ≈ Emol/2 ≈ −∆. These molecules are compos-
ite bosons condensed in the zero momentum state (BEC

regime). In the intermediate regime (−0.5 <
∼
0.5) we seem to have a smooth transition or crossover
from BCS to BEC.

The problem of calculating the ground state energy
and pairing gaps of superﬂuid gases has been solved
with the ﬁxed node Green’s function Monte Carlo (FN-
GFMC) method [8, 9, 10]. In this method, a trial wave
function ΨT (R) is evolved in imaginary time τ with the
ﬁxed node constraint [13]

Ψ(τ, R) = |e−τ (H−ET )|F N ΨT (R) .

(1)

We use R = r1, r2, . . . ; r1′ , r2′ , . . ., to denote the conﬁgu-
ration of atoms in the gas, and the subscripts FN denote
the ﬁxed node constraint. Particles 1, 2, . . . have spin up
and 1′, 2′, . . . have spin down. ET is adjusted to keep
the norm of the wave function constant. At large τ , the
evolved Ψ(τ, R) converges to the lowest energy state of
the system having the nodes of ΨT (R). From now on,
we assume that ΨT (R) is real and the limit τ → ∞ is
implicit.

Following Kalos [14], the mixed expectation value

hH(τ )imixed =

hΨT |H|Ψ(τ )i

FIG. 1: Pair distribution function g↑↑(r) before and after
the optimization at akF = ±∞. There is a noticeable dif-
ference between the variational and GFMC results obtained
with LOCV ΨT (R) using equations 4 and 7. At small r, the
extrapolated estimate of g↑↑(r) can have unphysical values
(< 0). When the optimum ΨT (R) is used, the variational,
GFMC and extrapolated g↑↑(r) become identical.

is calculated using Monte Carlo sampling techniques.
Since H commutes with the evolution operator we have

hH(τ )imixed =

hΨ(τ /2)|H|Ψ(τ /2)i
hΨ(τ /2)|Ψ(τ /2)i

≡ hH(τ /2)i .

(3)

By the variational principle hH(τ )imixed ≥ the ground
state energy E0. The nodal surface of ΨT (R) is varied to
minimize hH(τ )imixed, and this minimum value gives an
accurate estimate of E0 provided the variation is general
enough.

This procedure assures that the nodes of ΨT (R) are
near optimum, i.e. close to the nodes of the exact Ψ0(R).
However, the ΨT (R) itself can otherwise be very diﬀerent
from the Ψ0(R). For example, in references [8] and [9]
we use

ΨT (R) =

f↑↓(rij′ )ΦBCS(R) ,

where ΦBCS(R)
is a generalized Bardeen-Cooper-
Schrieﬀer wave function, and its nodes are optimized
by minimizing hH(τ )imixed. The f↑↓(rij′ ) is a nodeless
Jastrow pair correlation function between spin up and
down particles. The hH(τ )imixed does not depend upon
the choice of f↑↓(rij′ ); the Jastrow correlation is used
only to reduce the variance of the stochastic evolution of
hH(τ )imixed.

Mixed expectation values of other observables,
hOimixed, can easily be calculated with GFMC, but they
are more diﬃcult to interprete when [O, H] 6= 0. If one
assumes that |Ψ(τ )i = |ΨT i + |δΨi, then the desired ex-
pectation value (recall τ → ∞)

hO(τ )i =

hΨ(τ )|O|Ψ(τ )i
hΨ(τ )|Ψ(τ )i

Here hOivar. ≡ hΨT |O|ΨT i/hΨT |ΨT i is the variational
or trial estimate. When |δΨi is small, the extrapolation

hO(τ )iextrap. ≈ 2hO(τ )imixed − hOivar.

(6)

can be used to estimate hOi.

However, in the strongly interacting regime the δΨ is
not necessarily small, and the extrapolation (Eq. 6) may
not be valid. For example, we consider the pair distri-
bution function g↑↑(r) between parallel spin particles in
the akF → ±∞ limit. The mixed, trial and extrapolated
values of g↑↑(r) obtained from the ΨT (R) of Ref. [8] and
[9] are shown in Fig. 1. At small r, the extrapolated
g↑↑(r) < 0 indicating invalidity. On the other hand, the
extrapolated g↑↓(r) ≥ 0 as it must be. However, there

is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the mixed and vari-
ational estimates of g↑↓(r), which makes Eq. 6 a poor
assumption.

In principle, the Jastrow function in ΨT (R) can be
obtained by minimizing the trial energy hHivar.. Much
eﬀort has been made on this problem in the past decades
[15]. A simple, crude method called LOCV, based on
constrained minimization of the leading two-body cluster
contribution to hHivar. [16] was used in Ref. [8] and [9].
In this method, f↑↑(r) = f↓↓(r) = 1 and f↑↓(r) satisﬁes
the two-body Schr¨odinger equation

parameter. The calculated values of hHivar. (squares)
are compared with the FN-GFMC results of E0 in Fig.
2. They are well above E0, particularly at 1/akF > 0.
This sugests need for further optimization of ΨT (R) in
that regime.

The trial pair distribution functions are given by [15]

hgx(r)itrial = f 2

x (r) tx(r, f↑↑, f↑↓, ΦBCS, ρ) ,

(8)

where x can be ↑↑ or ↑↓ and tx is a complicated function
of r, f↑↑, f↑↓, ΦBCS and gas density ρ. It is diﬃcult to
calculate it exactly except by numerical methods. How-
ever, tx(r) is a relatively smooth function of r.

x (r)imixed and hg(n)

Our method to optimize fx(r) using GFMC is iterative.
Let hg(n)
x (r)ivar. be obtained from the
n-th trial f (n)
x (r) using the optimum ΦBCS. The opti-
mum ΦBCS does not depend on fx(r) and we use the
same set of parameters as in the Ref. [9]. We start with
the LOCV approximation providing ﬁrst trial set f (1)
x (r).
Then the next improved f (2)

x (r) is chosen as

x (r) = f (1)

(9)

If the diﬀerence between f (1)
x (r) is small, we
can assume that the tx(r) functions do not change much.
In this case

x (r) and f (2)

hg(2)

x (r)ivar. ∼ hg(1)

x (r)imixed .

(10)

Otherwise, by iterating this process one easily converges
to an f (n)

x (r) such that

hg(n)

x (r)ivar. ∼ hg(n)

x (r)imixed .

(11)

In the practice, hgx(r)imixed and hgx(r)ivar. have Monte
Carlo sampling errors. We approximate the square root

3

of their ratio (Eq. 9) by a smooth function of r chosen
as cos(p1r + p2)e−r/p3 + 1, and vary the parameters p1−3
to best ﬁt the Monte Carlo values.

The converged hg(n)

x (r)i are shown in ﬁgures 1 and 3,
and the values of hHivar. with the converged f (n)
x (r) are
shown in Fig. 2. They are much closer to FN-GFMC
estimates of E0 which are unaﬀected by this optimiza-
tion since hHimixed does not depend on fx(r). However,
the eﬀects of the optimized fx(r) are seen in the the re-
duced stochastical variance. In particular, the ET (Eq.
1) which is typically aﬀected by larger ﬂuctuations, be-
comes indistinguishable from hHimixed.

The pair distribution functions hgx(r)imixed are deter-
mined by the many body probability distribution given
by ΨT (R)Ψ0(R), while the hgx(r)ivar. are for |ΨT (R)|2.
Note that ΨT (R)Ψ0(R) >
∼ 0 since the nodes of ΨT (R)
have been varied to match those of Ψ0(R). For both
cases we deﬁne dimensionless hgx(r)i with the normal-
ization g(r → ∞) = 1.

If we can approximate the Ψ0(R) by a wave function

of the form

ΨT (R) =

(12)
the validity of Eq. 11 implies that f (n)
x (r),
the optimum fx(r). The equality of hgx(r)imixed deter-
mined by ΨT (R)Ψ0(R) with hgx(r)ivar. determined by
|ΨT (R)|2 implies that ΨT (R) ∼ Ψ0(R). Also, the close
agreement between hHivar. and E0 indicates that present
ΨT (R) has the main features of Ψ0(R) at 1/akf < 0. At
1/akF > 0, hHivar. is higher than E0 indicating that in
this region three-body correlations absent in the present
ΨT (R) are non negligible. In principle, we can include
products of triplet correlations FP (rij , rjk, rki) (↑↑↑ or
↓↓↓) and FM (rij′ , rj′k′ , rk′i) (↑↑↓ or ↓↓↑ ) in ΨT (R) and
generalize the present method to determine their optimal
forms.

The present calculations use a periodic box of length
L containing N↑ = N↓ = 7 with kF = 1. The maximum
pair seperation in this box, free from the ﬁnite size eﬀects
due to the cubic geometry of the system is L/2 ≈ 1.94r0,
where L is the size of the cube. Hence, the ﬁgures of fx(r)
and hgx(r)i are plotted up to this radial distance. The
present results are obtained using the cosh potential with
µr0 = 12 [8, 9] to approximate the interaction between ↑
and ↓ particles.

relations and those of Ref.
LOCV we have f↑↑(r) = 1, because there is little two
body interaction between parallel spin particles in dilute
Fermi gases. However, many body eﬀects generate an ef-
fective repulsion between parallel spin particles and the
optimum f↑↑(r) is < 1 at r <
∼ 1.5r0 as shown in Fig. 4.
The optimum and LOCV f↑↓(r) are generated by the
strong two body attraction in ↑↓ pairs and have qualita-

tively similar shapes (Fig. 5). For akF = −1 the LOCV
f↑↓(r) is near optimum. For stronger interactions, the
LOCV f↑↓(r ∼ 0) is generally larger than the optimum
by ∼ 10% (Fig. 5).

The expectation value of the potential energy, Epot =
Pi,j′ v(rij′ )i can easily be calculated from the mixed
h
and the variational distributions. There is a small dif-
ference between these when the converged f opt
x (r) are
used in the ΨT (R) as can be seen in Fig. 6. In princi-
ple,
Pi,j′ v(rij′ ) can be calculated from the g↑↓(r), and
its variational and mixed estimates should be the same
when the optimum fx(r) are used. The small diﬀerence
seen in Fig. 6 is due to statistical errors in Monte Carlo
calculations.

When 1/akF > 0, we can have normalized bound

4

states with radial wave functions R(r). When we deﬁne
ρ R(r), the R′2(r) is normalized analogous to
R′(r) ≡ q
g↑↓(r), and both can be compared as in Fig. 7. The
R′2(r) is the appropriately normalized gmol(r↑↓). When
1/akF → 0+, we know that R′2(r) → 0 (inﬁnite pair
size), however g↑↓(r) >
∼ 1. As the interaction becomes
stronger, the gmol(r) increases more rapidly and becomes
larger than the g↑↓(r) (Fig. 7) at small r. However, the
gmol(r) → 0 while g↑↓(r) → 1 as r → ∞.

In conclusion, the proposed method allows us to opti-
mize separately the ΦBCS and the Jastrow correlation in
dilute Fermi gases. The antiparallel correlation function
f↑↓(r) is most important, however in the strong interac-
tion regime (BEC), it is essential to optimize the f↑↑(r)
in order to extrapolate the variational and mixed expec-
tation values to the physical via Eq. 6.

The studies of momentum distributions and density
matrices of the superﬂuid gas may now be possible using
the optimum ΨT , and are in progress.

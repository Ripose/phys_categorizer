(Dated: 23 October 2000)

Frequency shifts of the 199Hg+ 5d106s 2S1/2 (F = 0, MF = 0) to 5d96s2 2D5/2 (F = 2, MF = 0)
electric-quadrupole transition at 282 nm due to external ﬁelds are calculated, based on a com-
bination of measured atomic parameters and ab initio calculations. This transition is under
investigation as an optical frequency standard. The perturbations calculated are the quadratic
Zeeman shift, the scalar and tensor quadratic Stark shifts, and the interaction between an ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld gradient and the atomic quadrupole moment. The quadrupole shift is likely
to be the most diﬃcult to evaluate in a frequency standard and may have a magnitude of about
1 Hz for a single ion in a Paul trap.
Key words: atomic polarizabilities; electric quadrupole interaction; mercury ion; optical fre-
quency standards; Stark shift; Zeeman shift.

1. INTRODUCTION

It has long been recognized that a frequency stan-
dard could be based on the 282 nm transition between
the ground 5d106s 2S1/2 level and the metastable 5d96s2
2D5/2 level of Hg+ [1]. The lifetime of the upper level
is 86(3) ms [2], so the ratio of the natural linewidth ∆ν
to the transition frequency ν0 is 2 × 10−15. (Unless oth-
erwise noted, all uncertainties given in this paper are
standard uncertainties, i.e., one standard deviation esti-
mates.) Doppler broadening can be avoided if the tran-
sition is excited with two counter-propagating photons,
as originally proposed by Bender et al.
[1] and subse-
quently demonstrated by Bergquist et al. [3]. However,
optical Stark shifts are greatly reduced if the transition
is driven instead with a single photon by the electric-
quadrupole interaction. In this case, Doppler broaden-
ing can be eliminated if the ion is conﬁned to dimen-
sions much less than the optical wavelength, as was ﬁrst
demonstrated by Bergquist et al. [4].

Recently, the (F = 0, MF = 0) to (F = 2, MF = 0) hy-
perﬁne component of the 199Hg+ 5d106s 2S1/2 to 5d96s2
2D5/2 single-photon transition has been observed with a
linewidth of only 6.7 Hz by Rafac et al. [5]. A laser servo-
locked to this transition is an extremely stable and repro-
ducible frequency reference. New developments in opti-
cal frequency metrology [6, 7] may soon make this system
practical as an atomic frequency standard or clock.

While the (F = 0, MF = 0) to (F = 2, MF = 0) hy-
perﬁne component has no linear Zeeman shift, it does
have a quadratic Zeeman shift that must be accounted
for. In addition, there is a second-order Stark shift and a
shift due to the interaction between the electric-ﬁeld gra-
dient and the atomic electric-quadrupole moment. None
of these shifts has yet been measured accurately, so it is
useful to have calculated values, even if they are not very

precise. Also, it is useful to know the functional form of
the perturbation, even if the magnitude is uncertain. For
example, the quadrupole shift can be eliminated by av-
eraging the transition frequency over three mutually or-
thogonal magnetic-ﬁeld orientations, independent of the
orientation of the electric-ﬁeld gradient.

2. METHODS AND NOTATION

The quadratic Zeeman shift can be calculated if the hy-
perﬁne constants and electronic and nuclear g-factors are
known. Similarly, the quadratic Stark eﬀect can be cal-
culated from a knowledge of the electric-dipole oscillator
strengths. The quadrupole shift depends on the atomic
wavefunctions. Some of these parameters have been mea-
sured, such as the hyperﬁne constants and some of the
oscillator strengths. There are also published calcula-
tions for some of the oscillator strengths.

Here, we estimate, by the use of the Cowan atomic-
structure codes, values for parameters for which there
are neither measured values nor published calculations.
The Cowan codes are based on the Hartree-Fock ap-
proximation with some relativistic corrections [8]. The
odd-parity conﬁgurations included in the calculation
were 5d10np (n = 6, 7, 8, 9), 5d105f , 5d96s6p, 5d96s7p,
5d96s5f , and 5d86s26p. The even-parity conﬁgurations
were 5d10ns (n = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), 5d10nd (n = 6, 7, 8, 9),
5d96s2, 5d96s7s, 5d96s6d, and 5d96p2. Recently, San-
sonetti and Reader have made new measurements of the
spectrum of Hg+ and classiﬁed many new lines [9]. They
also carried out a least-squares adjustment of the energy
parameters that enter the Cowan-code calculations in or-
der to match the observed energy levels. We use these
adjusted parameters in our Cowan-code calculations.

As one test of this method of calculation, we estimated

the weakly allowed 10.7 µm 5d106p 2P1/2 to 5d96s2 2D3/2
electric-dipole decay rate. This decay is allowed only be-
cause of conﬁguration mixing, since it requires two elec-
trons to change orbitals. The calculation shows the de-
cay to be due mostly to mixing between the 5d106p and
5d96s6p conﬁgurations. The calculated rate is 55.6 s−1;
the measured rate is 52(16) s−1 [2]. Another test is the
electric-quadrupole decay rate of the 5d96s2 2D5/2 level
to the ground level. The calculated rate is 12.6 s−1, and
the measured rate is 11.6(0.4) s−1. Similar calculations
have been carried out by Wilson [10].

Let H0 be the atomic Hamiltonian, exclusive of the hy-
perﬁne and external ﬁeld eﬀects, which are treated as per-
turbations. For convenience, we denote the eigenstates
of H0 corresponding to the electronic levels 5d106s 2S1/2
and 5d96s2 2D5/2 having Jz eigenvalue MJ by |S 1/2 MJi
and |D 5/2 MJi, respectively.
The corresponding eigenvalues of H0 are denoted
W (S, 1/2) and W (D, 5/2). An arbitrary eigenstate of
H0 with eigenvalue W (γ, J) and electronic angular mo-
mentum J is denoted |γ J MJi. Since 199Hg+ has in
addition a nuclear angular momentum I, where I = 1/2,
the complete state designation is |γJF MFi, where F is
the total angular momentum, and MF is the eigenvalue
of Fz.

3. QUADRATIC ZEEMAN SHIFT

In order to calculate the energy shifts due to the hy-
perﬁne interaction and to an external magnetic ﬁeld
B ≡ B ˆz, we deﬁne eﬀective Hamiltonian operators H ′
S
and H ′
D that operate within the subspaces of hyper-
ﬁne sublevels associated with the electronic levels 5d106s
2S1/2 and 5d96s2 2D5/2 respectively:

H ′
S = hASI · J + gJ (S)µBJ · B + g′

I µBI · B,

H ′
D = hADI · J + gJ (D)µBJ · B + g′

I µBI · B,

(1)

(2)

where AS and AD are the dipole hyperﬁne constants,
gJ (S) and gJ (D) are the electronic g-factors, g′
I is the
nuclear g-factor, h is the Planck constant, and µB is
the Bohr magneton. All of the parameters entering H ′
S
and H ′
D are known from experiments, although a more
accurate measurement of gJ (D) would be useful. The
ground-state hyperﬁne constant AS has been measured in
a 199Hg+ microwave frequency standard to be 40 507.347
996 841 59 (43) MHz [11]. The excited-state hyperﬁne
constant AD has been measured recently by an extension
to the work described in Ref. [5], in which the diﬀer-
ence in the frequencies of the |S 1/2 0 0i to |D 5/2 2 0i
and the |S 1/2 0 0i to |D 5/2 3 0i transition frequen-
cies was determined to be 3AD=2 958.57(12) MHz [12],

2

in good agreement with an earlier, less precise measure-
ment by Fabry-P´erot spectroscopy [13]. The ground-
state electronic g-factor gJ (S) was measured in 198Hg+
by rf-optical double resonance to be 2.003 174 5(74) [14].
The excited-state electronic g-factor gJ (D) was measured
in 198Hg+ by conventional grating spectroscopy of the
398 nm 5d106p 2P3/2 to 5d96s2 2D5/2 line to be 1.198
0(7) [15]. The diﬀerence in gJ (S) or gJ (D) between
198Hg+ and 199Hg+ is estimated to be much less than
the experimental uncertainties. The nuclear g-factor g′
I
is −5.422 967(9)×10−4 [16]. The measurement was made
with neutral ground-state 199Hg atoms, so the diamag-
netic shielding factor will be slightly diﬀerent from that
in the ion. However, this is eﬀect is negligible, since the
magnitude of g′
I is so small compared to gJ (S) or gJ (D).
The determination of gJ (D) could be improved by mea-
suring the optical-frequency diﬀerence between two com-
ponents of the 282 nm line and the frequency of a ground-
state microwave transition at the same magnetic ﬁeld.
Since the uncertainty in the quadratic Zeeman shift is
due mainly to the uncertainty in gJ (D), it is useful to see
how accurately it can be estimated theoretically. The
Land´e g-factor for a 2D5/2 state, including the correction
for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, is
1.200 464. The Cowan-code calculation shows that the
conﬁguration mixing does not change this value by more
than about 10−6, i.e., 1 in the last place. There are sev-
eral relativistic and diamagnetic corrections that modify
gJ (D), one of which, called the Breit-Margenau correc-
tion by Abragam and Van Vleck [17], is proportional to
the electron mean kinetic energy. The other corrections
are more diﬃcult to calculate. The Cowan-code result for
the mean kinetic energy of an electron in the 5d orbital of
the 5d96s2 conﬁguration is T = 19.32 hcR∞, where R∞
is the Rydberg constant. Using this value, we obtain a
theoretical value of gJ (D), including the Breit-Margenau
correction, of 1.199 85, which disagrees with the the ex-
perimental value by 1.85 × 10−3, which is 2.6 times the
estimated experimental uncertainty of Ref. [15].
If we
calculate gJ (D) for neutral gold, which is isoelectronic
to Hg+, by the same method, we obtain a value which
diﬀers from the accurately measured experimental one
[18] by (7 ± 2) × 10−5. Thus, the error in the calculated
value for gJ (D) of 199Hg+ might be less than 1 × 10−4,
but it is impossible to be certain of this, since there are
uncalculated terms. Measurements of the 199Hg+ optical
clock frequency at diﬀerent values of the magnetic ﬁeld
should result in a better experimental value for gJ (D) in
the near future.

For low magnetic ﬁelds (B less than 1 mT), it is suﬃ-
cient to calculate the energy levels to second order in B.
To this order in B, the energies of the hyperﬁne-Zeeman
sublevels for the ground electronic level are

W (S, 1/2, 1, 0, B) = W (S, 1/2) +

Here, W (γ, J, F, MF , B) denotes the energy of the state
|γJF MFi, including the eﬀects of the hyperﬁne interac-
tion and the magnetic ﬁeld.
At a value of B of 0.1 mT, the quadratic shift of the
|S 1/2 0 0i to |D 5/2 2 0i transition (optical clock tran-
sition)is −189.25(28) Hz, where the uncertainty stems
mainly from the uncertainty in the experimental value
of gJ (D). In practice, the error may be less than this if
the magnetic ﬁeld is determined from the Zeeman split-
tings within the |D 5/2 F MFi sublevels. The reason
is that an error in gJ (D) leads to an error in the value
of B inferred from the Zeeman splittings, which partly
compensates for the gJ (D) error. If instead we use the
calculated value of gJ (D), the quadratic shift for B = 0.1
mT is −189.98 Hz, where the uncertainty is diﬃcult to
estimate.

4. QUADRATIC STARK SHIFT

The theory of the quadratic Stark shift in free atoms
has been described in detail by Angel and Sandars [19].
The Stark Hamiltonian is

HE = −µ · E,

(12)

[5gJ(D) + g′
2

I ]W (S, B

.

where µ is the electric-dipole moment operator,

µ = −eXi

ri,

and E is the applied external electric ﬁeld. In Eq. (13),
ri is the position operator of the ith electron, measured
relative to the nucleus, and the summation is over all
electrons.

First consider an atom with zero nuclear spin, such as
198Hg+. To second order in the electric ﬁeld, the Stark
shifts of the set of sublevels |γJMJi depend on two pa-
rameters, αscalar(γ, J) and αtensor(γ, J), called the scalar
and tensor polarizabilities. In principle, when both mag-
netic and electric ﬁelds are present but are not parallel,
the energy levels are obtained by simultaneously diago-
nalizing the hyperﬁne, Zeeman, and Stark Hamiltonians.
In practice, the Zeeman shifts are normally much larger
than the Stark shifts, so that HE does not aﬀect the di-
agonalization. In that case, the energy shift of the state
|γJMJi due to HE is

∆WE(γ, J, MJ, E) = − 1

4 αtensor(γ, J)

[3M 2

(14)

Treating HE by second-order perturbation theory leads to the following expressions for the polarizabilities [19]:

The summations are over all levels other than |γJi. Equations (15) and(16) can be rewritten in terms of the oscillator

level.

We make the approximation that hyperﬁne interac-
tion does not modify the electronic part of the atomic
wavefunctions (the IJ-coupling approximation of Angel
and Sandars [19]). This approximation is adequate for
the present purpose, which is to evaluate the Stark shift
of the 199Hg+ optical clock transition. Obtaining the

diﬀerential Stark shift between the hyperﬁne levels of
the ground state, which is signiﬁcant for the 199Hg+
microwave frequency standard [11], requires going to a
higher order of perturbation theory [20].
In the IJ-
coupling approximation [19],

αscalar(γ, J, F ) = αscalar(γ, J),

αtensor(γ, J, F ) = (−1)I+J+F (cid:20) F (2F − 1)(2F + 1)(2J + 3)(2J + 1)(J + 1)

(21)

Equations (17) and (18) were used to evaluate the po-
larizabilities for the Hg+ 5d106s 2S1/2 and 5d96s2 2D5/2
levels. For the calculation of αscalar(S, 1/2), the os-
cillator strengths for all electric-dipole transitions con-
necting the 5d106s conﬁguration to the 5d10np (n =
6, 7, 8) and 5d96s6p conﬁgurations were included. These
were taken from the theoretical work of Brage et al.
[21]. The ﬁnal result is αscalar(S, 1/2)/(4πǫ0) = 2.41 ×
10−24 cm3, which compares very well with the value of
2.22 × 10−24 cm3 obtained by Henderson et al.
from
a combination of experimental and calculated oscilla-
tor strengths [22]. For the calculations of αscalar(D, 5/2)
and αtensor(D, 5/2), the oscillator strengths for electric-
dipole transitions to the 5d10np (n = 6, 7, 8), 5d105f ,
and 5d96s6p conﬁgurations were taken from Brage et
[21]. The oscillator strengths for electric-dipole
al.
transitions to the 5d96s7p and 5d86s26p conﬁgurations
were taken from the Cowan-code calculations. The re-
sults were αscalar(D, 5/2)/(4πǫ0) = 3.77× 10−24 cm3 and
αtensor(D, 5/2)/(4πǫ0) = −0.263 × 10−24 cm3. Evalu-
ating Eq. (21) for F =2 and F =3 in the 5d96s2 2D5/2

level, we obtain αtensor(D, 5/2, 2) = 4
αtensor(D, 5/2, 3) = αtensor(D, 5/2).

5 αtensor(D, 5/2) and

The tensor polarizability is much smaller than the
scalar polarizabilities and in any case does not contribute
if the external electric ﬁeld is isotropic, as is the case for
the blackbody radiation ﬁeld. The net shift of the op-
tical clock transition due to the scalar polarizabilities is
1
2 [αscalar(S, 1/2)− αscalar(D, 5/2)]E2. In frequency units,
the shift is −1.14 × 10−3 E2 Hz, where E is expressed
in V/cm. The error in the coeﬃcient is diﬃcult to esti-
mate, particularly since it is a diﬀerence of two quanti-
ties of about the same size. However, the total shifts are
small for typical experimental conditions. If the electric
ﬁeld is time-dependent, as for the blackbody ﬁeld, the
mean-squared value hE2i is taken. At a temperature of
300 K, the shift of the optical clock transition due to the
blackbody electric ﬁeld is −0.079 Hz. The mean-squared
blackbody ﬁeld is proportional to the fourth power of
the temperature. For a single, laser-cooled ion in a Paul
trap, the mean-squared trapping electric ﬁelds can be
made small enough that the Stark shifts are not likely to

be observable [23].

5. ELECTRIC QUADRUPOLE SHIFT

The atomic quadrupole moment is due to a depar-
ture of the electronic charge distribution of an atom from
spherical symmetry. Atomic quadrupole moments were
ﬁrst measured by the shift in energy levels due to an
applied electric-ﬁeld gradient in atomic-beam resonance
experiments [24, 25].

The interaction of the atomic quadrupole moment
with external electric-ﬁeld gradients, for example those
generated by the electrodes of an ion trap,
is analo-
gous to the interaction of a nuclear quadrupole moment
with the electric ﬁeld gradients due to the atomic elec-
trons. Hence, we can adapt the treatment used for the
electric-quadrupole hyperﬁne interaction of an atom [26].
The Hamiltonian describing the interaction of external
electric-ﬁeld gradients with the atomic quadrupole mo-
ment is

2

HQ = ∇E(2) · Θ(2) =

Xq=−2

(−1)q∇E(2)

(22)

where ∇E(2) is a tensor describing the gradients of the
external electric ﬁeld at the position of the atom, and
Θ(2) is the electric-quadrupole operator for the atom.

Following Ref. [26], we deﬁne the components of ∇E(2)

This is the deﬁnition used by Angel et al. [24].

(29)

In order to simplify the form of ∇E(2), we make a
principal-axis transformation as in Ref. [27]. That is, we

5

express the electric potential in the neighborhood of the
atom as

Φ(x′, y′, z ′) = A[(x′2 + y′2 − 2z ′2) + ǫ(x′2 − y′2)]. (30)
The principal-axis (primed) frame (x′,y′,z ′) is the one
in which Φ has the simple form of Eq. (30), while the
laboratory (unprimed) frame (x,y,z) is the in which the
magnetic ﬁeld is oriented along the z axis.

The tensor components of ∇E(2) in the principal-axis
frame are obtained by taking derivatives of Φ(x′, y′, z ′):

As long as the energy shifts due to HQ are small rel-
ative to the Zeeman shifts, which is the usual case in
practice, HQ can be treated as a perturbation. In that
case, it is necessary only to evaluate the matrix elements
of HQ that are diagonal in the basis of states |γJF MFi,
where F is the total atomic angular momentum, includ-
ing nuclear spin I, and MF is the eigenvalue of Fz with
respect to the laboratory (not principal-axis) frame. Let
ω denote the set of Euler angles {α, β, γ} that takes the
principal-axis frame to the laboratory frame. To be ex-
plicit, starting from the principal-axis frame, we rotate
the coordinate system about the z axis by α, then about
the new y axis by β, and then about the new z axis by γ
so that the rotated coordinate system coincides with the
laboratory coordinate system. We can set γ = 0, since
the ﬁnal rotation about the laboratory z axis, which is
parallel to B, has no eﬀect. The states |γJF mi′ deﬁned
in the principal-axis frame and the states |γJF µi deﬁned
in the laboratory frame are related by

It is simple to show, by directly integrating the angu-
lar factor in square brackets in Eq. (45), that the average
value of the diagonal matrix elements of HQ, taken over
all possible orientations of the laboratory frame with re-
spect to the principal-axis frame, is zero. This also fol-
lows directly from the fact that the quantity in square
brackets is a linear combination of spherical harmonics.
It is less obvious that the average, taken over any three
mutually perpendicular orientations of the laboratory z
quantization axis, is also zero. This result is proven in the
Appendix. This provides a method for eliminating the

quadrupole shift from the observed transition frequency.
The magnetic ﬁeld must be oriented in three mutually
perpendicular directions with respect to the trap elec-
trodes, which are the source of the external quadrupole
ﬁeld, but with the same magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld.
The average of the transition frequencies taken under
these three conditions does not contain the quadrupole
shift.

The reduced matrix element in Eq. (45) is, in the IJ-

coupling approximation,

where I is included in the state notation in order to spec-

case of the 199Hg+ 5d96s2 2D5/2 level, the reduced matrix
elements are

(47)

Since the Cowan-code calculation shows that there is
very little conﬁguration mixing in the 199Hg+ 5d96s2
2D5/2 level, Θ(D , 5/2) can be reduced to a matrix ele-
ment involving only the 5d orbital:

The apparent sign reversal in Eq. (49) relative to Eqs. (26) and (29) is due to the fact that the quadrupole moment
is due to a single hole in the otherwise ﬁlled 5d shell rather than to a single electron. According to the Cowan-code
calculation,

Since the quadrupole shifts are zero in the 5d106s 2S1/2 level, the quadrupole shift of the 199Hg+ optical clock

6. APPENDIX. ANGULAR AVERAGING OF THE QUADRUPOLE SHIFT

For the purpose of describing the quadrupole shift, the orientation of the laboratory (quantization) axis with respect
to the principal-axis frame is deﬁned by the angles β and α. In the principal-axis coordinate system, a unit vector
along the laboratory z axis is deﬁned in terms of β and α by

ˆz = (sin β cos α, sin β sin α, cos β).

(59)

We wish to show that the angular dependence of the quadrupole shift is such that the diagonal matrix elements given
by Eq. (45) average to zero, for ˆz along any three mutually perpendicular directions.

An arbitrary set of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors e1, e2, and e3 can be parameterized by the set of

angles θ, φ, and ψ in the following way:

e1 = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ),
e2 = (cos φ cos θ cos ψ − sin φ sin ψ, sin φ cos θ cos ψ + cos φ sin ψ,− sin θ cos ψ),
e3 = (− cos φ cos θ sin ψ − sin φ cos ψ,− sin φ cos θ sin ψ + cos φ cos ψ, sin θ sin ψ).

(60)
(61)
(62)

It can be veriﬁed by direct computation that ei · ej = δij.

The quadrupole shift can be evaluated for each of these three unit vectors substituted for ˆz [Eq. (59)] and the
average taken. First consider the average of the quantity (3 cos2 β − 1) that appears in Eq. (45): We use the fact that
cos β is the third component of ˆz, so the average is:

8

h3 cos2 β − 1i = cos2 θ + sin2 θ cos2 ψ + sin2 θ sin2 ψ − 1,

(63)
(64)
(65)
for arbitrary θ, φ, and ψ. Similarly, the average of the other angle-dependent term in Eq. (45), sin2 β(cos2 α− sin2 α),
is calculated by making use of the fact that sin β cos α is the ﬁrst component of ˆz, and sin β sin α is the second:

= cos2 θ + sin2 θ − 1,
= 0,

hsin2 β(cos2 α − sin2 α)i = 1

3 [sin2 θ cos2 φ − sin2 θ sin2 φ
+(cos φ cos θ cos ψ − sin φ sin ψ)2 − (sin φ cos θ cos ψ + cos φ sin ψ)2
+(cos φ cos θ sin ψ + sin φ cos ψ)2 − (sin φ cos θ sin ψ − cos φ cos ψ)2],

= 0,

(66)
(67)

for arbitrary θ, φ, and ψ. Hence, the matrix elements of
HQ given by Eq. (45) average to zero for any three mu-
tually perpendicular orientations of the laboratory quan-
tization axis.

The existence of a second bound state of PsH that is electronically stable and also stable against
positron annihilation by the normal 2γ and 3γ processes is demonstrated by explicit calculation.
The state can be found in the 2,4So symmetries with the two electrons in a spin triplet state. The
binding energy against dissociation into the H(2p) + Ps(2p) channel was 6.06 × 10−4 Hartree. The
dominant decay mode of the states will be radiative decay into a conﬁguration that autoionizes
or undergoes positron annihilation. The NaPs system of the same symmetry is also electronically
stable with a binding energy of 1.553 × 10−3 Hartree with respect to the Na(3p) + Ps(2p) channel.

The stability of a bound state composed of two elec-
trons and a positron, the positronium negative ion, was
ﬁrst demonstrated in a seminal calculation by Wheeler
[1]. Shortly after this calculation, the four body systems,
PsH and Ps2 were shown to be stable [2, 3]. Since that
time, only a few other electronically stable states have
been discovered that can be formed from combinations
of p+,e− and e+. These are additional bound states of
Ps2 [4, 5, 6], a compound that is best described as e+PsH
[7], and a (p+, 4e−, 2e+) complex [7]. Additionally, a
number of atoms have been identiﬁed as being capable
of binding positronium and positrons [8, 9, 10]

A common feature of all these systems is that the
positron annihilation process occurs by either a 2γ or 3γ
process with rates of order 109 s−1 or 106 s−1 (for those
systems for which an annihilation rate has been deter-
mined). In the present letter, we identify a new class of
positronic compounds that are electronically stable, and
in addition they have the unusual feature of decaying
very slowly by 2γ or 3γ annihilation. Stable variants of
PsH, and NaPs are identiﬁed and initial estimates of their
binding energies are given. The existence of a new bound
state of PsH is somewhat surprising given the amount
of activity involved in identifying the resonant states of
the Ps-H complex [11, 12, 13]. The new PsH and NaPs
bound states are unnatural parity states with symmetry
conditions that act to prevent positron annihilation and
to also prevent decay into the the lowest energy dissoci-
ation products. These systems have the two electrons in
a spin triplet state, a total orbital angular momentum of
zero, and an odd parity, i.e. LΠ = 0−. Positron anni-
hilation by the 2γ or 3γ process is forbidden for such a
state.

First consider the 2γ process (which occurs at a rate of
8 × 109 s−1 for the Ps ground state). For this process to
occur, the annihilating electron-positron pair must be in
a spin singlet state and the relative angular momentum
must be zero. (The decay rate is not absolutely zero since

the Ps(2p) levels can undergo 2γ and 3γ annihilation at
rate proportional to α5 and α6 respectively [14, 15]. The
rates for the diﬀerent Ps(2p) levels have been calculated
to be approximately 104 s−1 [14, 15].)

Now consider the electron-positron annihilation of a
PsH state of 2So symmetry. The relative angular mo-
mentum of the annihilating pair (Lrel) must be zero. This
means the total angular momentum of the state will come
from the center-of-mass motion of the annihilating pair
(Lcm), and from the angular momentum of the spectator
electron (Lspectator). The total parity of the state is de-
termined by the parity of the individual constituents, i.e.
Π = (−1)Lspectator+Lcm+Lrel. It is simply not possible to
form an odd parity state with a total angular momentum
of zero if any one of the constituent angular momenta is
zero. Consequently, a two electron/one positron state of
2So symmetry cannot decay by the fast 2γ process.

These arguments also apply to the 3γ annihilation pro-
cess. The 3γ process occurs for electron-positron pairs in
a spin triplet state with a relative angular momentum of
zero. Once again, it is simply impossible to form a state
of 2So (or 4So) symmetry if the relative angular momen-
tum of the annihilating pair is zero. So it is reasonable
to conclude that the lowest order 3γ decay is not possible
from a 2,4So state.

These LΠ conditions also act to prevent the dissocia-
tion of these four-body systems into combinations of the
lower energy dissociation channels. Once again consider
a 2So state of PsH. Dissociation into Ps(1s)+H(1s) is
forbidden since Π = (−1)L where L is the orbital an-
gular momentum between the Ps(1s) and H(1s) frag-
ments.
Similarly, dissociation into Ps(ns)+H(nℓ) or
Ps(nℓ)+H(ns) does not occur since it is not possible to
construct an LΠ = 0− state if one of the angular mo-
mentum is zero. The lowest energy dissociation channel
would be into Ps(2p)+H(2p) (p-wave) with an energy of
−0.1875 Hartree. Another possible decay would be into
the H−(2p2 3Pe)+e+ channel with a threshold energy

of −0.125355 Hartree [16, 17, 18]. The stability of the
H−(2p2 3Pe) bound state also suggests a mechanism for
binding. One can think of the positron trapped into a 2p
state of the H− attractive potential well. If the H− state
is regarded as a point particle with an internal energy of
≈ −0.125 Hartree, then a positron in the 2p state will
lower the total energy to −0.250 Hartree. In actuality
the H−(2p2 3Pe) state is very diﬀuse, but this model does
suggest that there is a large energy advantage associated
with binding the positron to the negative ion.

All the calculations in the present paper were per-
formed with a conﬁguration interaction approach [19, 20,
21]. The CI basis was constructed by letting the two
electrons (particles 1 and 2) and the positron (particle
0) form all the possible total angular momentum LT = 0
conﬁgurations, with the two electrons in a spin-triplet
state, subject to the selection rules,

max(ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ J ,

min(ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lint ,
(−1)(ℓ0+ℓ1+ℓ2) = −1 .

(1)

(2)
(3)

In these rules ℓ0, ℓ1 and ℓ2 are respectively the orbital
angular momenta of the positron and the two electrons.
We deﬁne hEiJ to be the energy of the calculation with
a maximum orbital angular momentum of J. The sin-
gle particle orbitals were Laguerre Type Orbitals (LTOs)
with a common exponent chosen for all the orbitals of
a common ℓ [19, 20, 21]. The orbitals basis sets for the
positron and electrons were identical.

(the number of positron orbitals was the name) while NCI
gives the total number of conﬁgurations. The results of the
J → ∞ energy extrapolations at J = 10 are also given.

The Hamiltonian was diagonalized in a basis con-

2

structed from a large number of single particle orbitals,
including orbitals up to ℓ = 10. There were 15 radial
basis functions for each ℓ. Note, the symmetry of the
state prevented the electrons or positrons from occupy-
ing ℓ = 0 orbitals. The largest calculation was performed
with J = 10 and Lint = 3 and gave a CI basis dimen-
sion of 155925. The parameter Lint does not have to
be particularly large since it is mainly concerned with
electron-electron correlations [20]. The resulting Hamil-
tonian matrix was diagonalized with the Davidson algo-
rithm [22], and a total of 300 iterations were required for
the largest calculation.

The energy of the PsH 2,4So state as a function of J
is given in Table I. The calculations only give an en-
ergy lower than the H(2p) + Ps(2p) threshold of −0.1875
Hartree for J ≥ 9. A major technical problem af-
ﬂicting CI calculations of positron-atom interactions is
the slow convergence of the energy with J [10, 21].
The J → ∞ energy, hEi∞, is determined by the use
of an asymptotic analysis. The successive increments,
∆EJ = hEiJ − hEiJ−1, to the energy can written as an
inverse power series [21, 23, 24, 25, 26], viz

The ﬁrst term in the series starts with a power of 6 since

The J → ∞ limit, has been determined by ﬁtting sets
of hEiJ values to asymptotic series with either 1, 2 or
3 terms. The coeﬃcients, AE, BE and CE for the 3-
term expansion are determined at a particular J from 4
successive energies (hEiJ−3, hEiJ−2, hEiJ−1 and hEiJ ).
Once the coeﬃcients have been determined it is easy to
sum the series to ∞ and obtain the variational limit.
Application of asymptotic series analysis to helium has
resulted in CI calculations reproducing the ground state
energy to an accuracy of ≈10−8 Hartree [26, 28].

Figure 1 shows the estimates of hEi∞ as a function of
J. A quick visual examination suggests that the extrap-
olations are converging to a common energy while the
energy of the three-term extrapolation is close to stabi-
lized at J = 10. The impact of the extrapolations is sig-
niﬁcant since they more than double the binding energy.
The most precise estimate of the binding energy is the
three-term extrapolation at J = 10, namely 6.06 × 10−4
Hartree (this is computed using the hEi∞ in Table I).

rect part of the core potential is attractive for electrons
and repulsive for the positron. The impact of the direct
and exchange part of the HF core interactions on the ac-
tive particles are computed without approximation. One-
and two-body semi-empirical polarization potentials are
then added to the potential. The adjustable parameters
of the core-polarization potential are deﬁned by reference
to the spectrum of neutral atom [20, 30].

The system that was investigated was the 2,4So state of
NaPs. The energies of the 3s and 3p states in the model
potential were −0.18885491 and −0.11156294 Hartree.
The experimental binding energies are −0.188858 and
−0.111547 Hartree respectively [31]. Electronic sta-
bility requires a total 3-body energy of −0.17405849
Hartree. The energy of the 3Pe excited state of Na−
is −0.11342529 Hartree, i.e the Na(3p) has an electron
aﬃnity of 0.001862 Hartree with respect to attaching an
electron to the 3Pe state. This is reasonably close to the
original value of Norcross, 0.00228 Hartree [29].

Having the established the stability of the 2,4So state
of PsH, it is natural to ask whether other systems with
this symmetry are stable. The obvious candidates are
the alkali atoms, since some of them have np2 3Pe nega-
tive ion bound states [29] that can act as a parent state
to bind the positron. The treatment of such systems re-
quires the use of a frozen core approximation. The details
of this approximation have been discussed in great detail
elsewhere [19, 20, 21], so only the briefest description is
given here. The model Hamiltonian is initially based on
a Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function for the neutral atom
ground state. The core orbitals are then frozen. The di-

FIG. 2: The binding energy (in units of Hartree) of the 2,4So
state of NaPs as a function of J. The directly calculated
binding energy is shown as the solid line while the J → ∞
limits using eq. (4) with 1, 2 or 3 terms are shown as the
dashed lines. The Na(3p) + Ps(2p) dissociation threshold is
shown as the horizontal solid line. lines.

The calculations upon NaPs were very similar in scope
and scale to those carried out upon PsH. About the only
diﬀerence was that an extra ℓ = 1 orbital was added
to the electron basis. Table II gives the 3-body energy
(relative to the Na+ core) as a function of J. The binding
energy εJ is deﬁned as εJ = −(hEi + 0.17410932). The
positron complex is more tightly bound than for PsH and
becomes electronically stable when J ≥ 5.

Figure 2 shows the variation of ε∞ as a function of J.

Once again the two and three term extrapolations seem
to be converging to a common energy which is some-
what larger than the best explicit calculation. The 3-
term value of ε∞ determined at J = 10 was 0.001553
Hartree. This is probably the the best estimate of the
binding energy of the complex. The positron can annihi-
late with the core electrons via the 2γ process since the
symmetry considerations are irrelevant here. However,
the annihilate rate of Γcore = 1.66 × 106 s−1 is small
because the positron cannot occupy a ℓ = 0 orbital.

The PsH and NaPs 2,4So complexes are stable against
auto-ionizaton, and only decay slowly by positron anni-
hilation. However there are other possible decay modes.
Both these complexes can emit a photon, decaying to a
state of 2,4Pe symmetry. For example, a Ps(np) fragment
in the complex can emit a photon decaying to a Ps(1s)
type fragment. The Ps(1s) fragment could then annihi-
late by the 2γ or 3γ process. In addition, a 2,4Pe state
could also decay by auto-ionization. Due to their low
binding energies, these systems can be expected to have
a structure composed of an Ps(2p) cluster loosely bound
to an atomic X(np) excited state. The lifetime of these
states can be expected to be comparable to the lifetime
of the fragments against single photon decay, e.g. H(2p)
→ H(1s). So the overall lifetimes of the states can be
expected to be of order 10−8 - 10−9 seconds.

It is possible that there are other positronic complexes
of 2,4So symmetry that are bound. The K−, Rb− and
Cs− ions have all been predicted to have np2 3Pe bound
states. So the existence of a stable 2,4So positronic com-
plex would seem to be highly likely.
It would also be
interesting to examine Li as this does not appear to have
a bound 3Pe negative ion [29].

Besides the alkali atoms, another physical system pos-
sibly admitting an unnatural parity bound state would
be the di-positronium molecule. There have been two at-
tempts to ﬁnd such a bound state, they were unsuccess-
ful or inconclusive [32, 33]. However, the investigation of
Bao and Shi showed that a 1So state was very close to
being bound, even if it was not bound [33]. This raises
the tantalizing possibility that a more exhaustive calcu-
lation might reveal the existence of a Ps2 state that de-
cayed very slowly by positron annihilation. Besides the
Ps2 molecule itself, there is the possible existence of a
new biexciton excited state [34]. The parent Ps− 3Pe ion
is known to be stable for certain me+ /me− mass ratios
[35, 36]. In circumstances where the mass ratios make
the 3Pe state of the charged exciton (e−,e−,h) state sta-
ble, it could be expected that a biexciton state of 1,3,5So
symmetry would be electronically stable.

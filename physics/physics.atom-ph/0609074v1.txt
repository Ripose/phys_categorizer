The possibility of achieving highly selective excitation of low metastable states of hydrogen and
helium atoms by using short laser pulses with reasonable parameters is demonstrated theoretically.
Interactions of atoms with the laser ﬁeld are studied by solving the close-coupling equations without
discretization. The parameters of laser pulses are calculated using diﬀerent kinds of optimization
procedures. For the excitation durations of hundreds of femtoseconds direct optimization of the
parameters of one and two laser pulses with Gaussian envelopes is used to introduce a number of
simple schemes of selective excitation. To treat the case of shorter excitation durations, optimal
control theory is used and the calculated optimal ﬁelds are approximated by sequences of pulses
with reasonable shapes. A new way to achieve selective excitation of metastable atomic states by
using sequences of attosecond pulses is introduced.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear laser spectroscopy provides new possibilities
to create and study selectively excited states of quan-
tum systems [1, 2]. Development of the two-photon ex-
citation technique [3] made it possible to obtain small
concentrations of hydrogen in the 2s metastable state.
This was suﬃcient to carry out precise optical measure-
ments of the hyperﬁne structure of 2s state [4] and other
relativistic and radiative eﬀects [5]. Metastable atoms
and atomic ions also play an important role in excitation
and charge transfer processes, even in high-temperature
laboratory and astrophysical plasmas [6]. Small concen-
trations of metastable atoms and atomic ions can signif-
icantly aﬀect the radiative spectra of plasmas because of
large cross sections of electronic capture to the excited
states of highly-charged ions during collisions with the
metastable atoms [6]. This conclusion is based on the-
oretical and indirect spectroscopic observations. Unfor-
tunately, direct measurements are still very diﬃcult due
to the low eﬃciency of modern techniques for the pro-
duction of beams of metastable atoms [7]. The above ex-
amples demonstrate the importance of the development
of eﬀective methods for selective excitation of metastable
atomic states.

Recent progress in laser techniques as well as in theo-
retical understanding of multiphoton processes in atoms
makes it possible to introduce novel methods for eﬀective
selective excitation of atomic states by using short laser
pulses. A number of approaches to control population
transfer between atomic and molecular states have been
proposed so far. They can be roughly divided into two

groups according to the basic principles. The methods
from the ﬁrst group exploit some known physical mech-
anisms [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], e.g., it
is possible to introduce some reliable and solvable model
equations to estimate the parameters of the controlling
laser ﬁeld analytically, while the methods from the second
group are based on the idea of direct variation of the laser
ﬁeld to maximize the desired output [19, 20, 21, 22, 23].
The schemes from the ﬁrst group ultimately rely on
the properties of π-pulses or on adiabatic properties. The
controlling laser ﬁeld is found as an accurate or approx-
imate solution of the coupled equations within rotating
wave approximation. These schemes, in turn, can be
classiﬁed by the number of laser pulses involved.

Population inversion achieved by using a single π-pulse
represents the simplest case [8, 9]. The frequency of the
laser should be in resonance with the transition energy
and the control is performed by changing the pulse area.
This method can also be used to control multiphoton
transitions. In that case, the frequency of the laser pulse
should be a fraction of the transition energy so that the
energy conservation rules are satisﬁed. The advantages
of this scheme are that it is simple and that the inten-
sity of the controlling laser pulse is relatively small. The
main disadvantages are that the eﬃciency of the scheme
is sensitive to the pulse area and that the resonance con-
ditions should be satisﬁed accurately, especially in the
case of multiphoton excitation.

The schemes based on adiabatic rapid passage (ARP)
rely on adiabatic properties [8, 10, 11]. In this case a sin-
gle chirped laser pulse is used to establish an adiabatic
regime so that the complete population transfer occurs as
a result of system evolution along the initially populated
adiabatic state. The population transfer is not sensitive
to the pulse area once an adiabatic regime is established,
so the method is quite robust. However, the pulse area

must be much larger than in the case of π-pulses. This
becomes critical if the competing ionization or dissocia-
tion processes are signiﬁcant.

Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage

(STIRAP)
emerged as a very eﬃcient method to provide almost
complete population transfer in a three-level system [12].
In its simplest form, the scheme involves a two-photon
Raman process,
in which an interaction with a ﬁrst
(pump) pulse links the initial state with an intermedi-
ate state, which in turn interacts via a second (Stokes)
pulse with a ﬁnal target state. An important advantage
is that almost no population is placed into the intermedi-
ate state, and thus the process is insensitive to any pos-
sible decay from that state. In more complicated cases
the method is used to create a maximal coherent super-
position of several states [13] and complete population
transfer via several intermediate states [14]. The analog
of the STIRAP which relies on adiabatic properties is
called chirped adiabatic passage by two-photon absorp-
tion (CAPTA) [15].

Recently an eﬀective scheme based on the idea of pe-
riodic chirping was introduced [16, 17]. Within this
scheme, a sequence of chirped laser pulses or a laser with
periodic chirping is used to establish multiple crossings
between dressed initial and target levels. Eﬀective laser
control is performed by manipulating the parameters of
these crossings and adiabatic phase diﬀerences between
the two crossings directly. In its simplest formulation the
complete population transfer can be achieved by using a
single quadratically chirped pulse. Because of interfer-
ence between the crossings, the necessary pulse area of
each pulse is much smaller compared to the ARP; how-
ever the method is still quite robust. These advantages
make the method useful in the ﬁeld of wave packet con-
trol [18]. However, the area of the pulse is still larger
than in the case of control by non-chirped pulses.

The methods from the second group are based on max-
imization of the desired output by a step-by-step adjust-
ment of the controlling ﬁeld. The main advantage of
these methods is that controlling ﬁeld search is performed
explicitly, so that complicated systems can be controlled.
These methods can be arranged according to the measure
of the controlling parameter space.

In the simplest case, the number of controlling laser
pulses and their envelopes are ﬁxed. Each pulse is de-
scribed by a few parameters: peak intensity, central fre-
quency, chirp rate, central time and full width at half
maximum (FWHM). Control is performed by direct opti-
mization of these parameters. By solving the Schr¨odinger
equation, the ﬁnal population of the desired state can be
determined as a function of the parameters of the con-
trolling pulses. Thus, well established numerical proce-
dures for maximization of this function of many variables
can be used [24]. It is easy to demonstrate that all the
schemes discussed above can be reproduced by direct op-
timization as particular cases. The approach can be con-
sidered as an optimization with respect to a ﬁnite set of
parameters, i.e., in a multi-dimensional space.

2

To design the controlling ﬁeld without any restrictions
on its shape, the optimal control theory (OCT) was devel-
oped [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. It is based on the idea that the
controlling laser pulse should maximize a certain func-
tional. The basic variational procedure leads to a set of
equations for the optimal laser ﬁeld, which include two
Schr¨odinger equations to describe the dynamics starting
from the initial and target state wave functions. The
optimal laser ﬁeld is given by the imaginary part of the
correlation function of these two wave functions. This
system of equations of optimal control must be solved
iteratively in general. The reader can ﬁnd a comprehen-
sive review of OCT in [19]. The main disadvantage of
this method is that in many cases the generated optimal
ﬁeld is hardly possible to realize in an experiment. The
approach can be considered as optimization with respect
to a continious set of parameters, i.e., in the functional
space.

In the case of selective excitation of metastable atomic
states by laser pulses, a multiphoton interaction is the
basic mechanism of the process. Such eﬀects as direct
ionization [25, 26], resonant transitions via intermediate
discrete and continuum states [26, 27, 28, 29, 30], above
threshold ionization [26, 32, 33, 34], and electron rescat-
tering by the atomic core [35, 36, 37, 38] are essential.
An accurate treatment of all these eﬀects requires the
exact solution of the quantum equations to describe the
dynamics of the system. Unfortunately, it is impossible
to introduce some reliable and solvable model equations
to estimate the parameters of the controlling laser ﬁeld
analytically. Thus, the methods of maximization of de-
sired output should be used.

state of hydrogen and the

In the present work selective excitations of

the
metastable 2s
singlet
metastable 1s2s 1S state of helium are studied using both
the direct optimization of laser parameters and the op-
timal control theory. To integrate the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation, the well established close-coupling
approach based on the properties of time-dependent in-
tegral equations [28, 29, 30, 31] is used. This approach is
the most suitable for this kind of spectroscopic calcula-
tion. As electron-atom collisions rapidly destroy atomic
metastable states, a search of the optimal laser param-
eters is performed under the requirement that not only
high ﬁnal population of desired metastable state should
be achieved, but also ionization probability should be
small [4, 5].

The present paper is organized as follows. In the next
section the theoretical approaches are summarized, and
relations between the results of the optimal control cal-
culations and the recently known schemes are demon-
strated. In Sec. III direct optimization of the parame-
ters of one- and two laser pulses with Gaussian envelope
is used to introduce a number of simple schemes for se-
lective excitation of H(2s) and He(1s2s 1S). In Sec. IV
the optimal control theory is used to look for other possi-
ble controlling laser ﬁelds. A new mechanism of selective
excitation by using attosecond pulses is introduced. Sec.

V contains a summary.

We employ the close-coupling (CC) method on the ba-
sis of the orthogonal and normalized unperturbed atomic
wave functions of the discrete and continuum states and
expand the total wavefunction as

The Hermitian system of coupled equations for the co-
eﬃcients of the discrete and continuum states follows
from substituting the expansion Eq. (2) into the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation Eq. (1) as

The matrix elements Uνν′ , Uνµ(E) and Uµµ′ (E, E′) are
integrals over r-space taken with the atomic dipole mo-
ment operator.

The ﬁrst and the second sums in Eq. (3) describe the
bound-bound and free-bound transitions, respectively.

These transitions result in a signiﬁcant redistribution of
the population of discrete states. This in turn strongly af-
fects the ionization process [28, 29, 30, 31]. The ﬁrst sum
in Eq. (4) describes ionization from all the discrete states
and the integral term (free-free transitions) describes
a multiphoton inverse bremsstrahlung process (within
quantum mechanical considerations) or rescattering pro-
cesses (within quasiclassical considerations). These pro-
cesses play an important role in formation of the pho-
toelectronic spectra at high energies [35, 36, 37, 38].
However, since the free-free matrix elements practically
do not aﬀect the discrete state amplitudes aν (t), it is
possible to neglect them for the evaluation of aν (t).
The transitions neglected in this approximation are the
third-order (bound-free-free-bound) ones. The role of the
free-free transitions was carefully investigated in Refs.
[29, 30, 32, 33, 34], and this assumption was conﬁrmed
to work well.

The close-coupling equations Eqs. (3-4) with the free-
free transitions neglected can be solved by discretizing
the continuum or by employing the recently developed
approach based on the properties of the time-dependent
integral equations without any discretization of the con-
tinuum [28, 29, 30, 31]. As the nonresonant interaction
between the lower and highly excited discrete states is
small,
it is possible to adjust the number of discrete
states involved in expansion Eq. (2) so that the results of
the calculations do not change. Although, strictly speak-
ing, this procedure does not prove the convergence of the
close-coupling approach, it is still widely used in colli-
sional physics [6, 39].

In the present study we consider excitation and ion-
ization of a single atomic electron in the ﬁeld of linearly
polarized laser pulses.

laser pulses Eq. (5) with a Gaussian shape:

f (τ, ∆t) = exp

4 ln 2

(cid:21)

(cid:20)−

(6)

The system is controlled by changing peak amplitudes
Fj, frequencies ωj, chirp rates αj, central times tj, and
FWHM’s τj of the component pulses. By solving the

Schr¨odinger equation one can determine the ﬁnal popula-
tion of a selected state as a function of these parameters.
To ﬁnd the maximum of this function, the conjugate gra-
dient search method [24] is used here. The gradient of
the ﬁnal population of the target state with respect to
the laser parameters is calculated numerically using the
ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation. The optimization starts
from some initial guess parameters.

As diﬀerent laser pulse parameters have diﬀerent di-
mensions, the parameters should be put on a common
ground by using dimensionless units, or the optimizations
with respect to diﬀerent types of parameters should be
performed separately. In the ﬁrst case the convergence of
the optimization procedure could depend on the dimen-
sionless units used.
Indeed, the eﬃciency of the selec-
tive excitation by non-chirped pulse strongly depends on
whether or not the resonant conditions are achieved, so
that by using common atomic units one should ﬁnd the
maximum of the function that strongly depends on one
group of arguments (frequencies) and only weakly on the
other arguments (intensities, durations etc.). This exam-
ple demonstrates that proper dimensionless units should
be used to ensure reasonable convergence. Moreover, the
derived optimal parameters could depend on how that
units are deﬁned.

In the present study the optimizations with respect to
diﬀerent types of parameters are performed separately so
that each step of the optimization procedure should con-
tain a set of optimizations with respect to the parameters
for all pulses that have the same dimension. Generally,
some laser parameters should be linked with each other to
achieve a maximum of the desired output. If the chirping
rate is zero, the optimal intensity and duration of each
pulse are related to each other by some pulse area con-
servation rule. To avoid this uncertainty, we assume the
durations of the pulses to be equal. After the optimal
parameters of the controlling sequence of laser pulses are
found, we can adjust intensities and durations to ﬁt the
speciﬁcs of the experimental technique.

The order of optimizations performed at each step of
the direct search aﬀects the eﬃciency, convergence and
resulting controlling scheme. However, since the laser
ﬁeld, Eq. (5), has only ﬁve diﬀerent types of parame-
ters, the number of possible nonequivalent orders of op-
timization is limited. Table I presents the correspon-
dence between the controlling schemes generated by the
direct optimization method with diﬀerent orders of opti-
mizations performed at each step and previously known
schemes. Since the last schemes have been established
without bound-free transitions taken into account the
continuum states are not included in the test calculations
of Table I. The continuum states are, however, taken into
account at all other calculations, reported in the present
paper.

The durations of all the pulses are assumed to be equal
and do not change during optimization. Initial param-
eters used in all the calculations are 1 GW/cm2 for in-
tensities of all pulses, frequencies are estimated from the

in cases 5 and 6. Our calculations show that number of
steps required to achieve convergence is about one and a
half the number of laser pulses used in the scheme.

The procedure of direct optimization of laser parame-
ters can also be used to calculate intrinsic parameters of
the atomic system. For example, by ﬁxing the intensity
of the laser and calculating the optimal frequency of se-
lective excitation of diﬀerent target states, the dynamic
Stark shifts of these states can be easily estimated.

The dynamics of the atom in the laser ﬁeld is described
by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (1). The
initial state wave function
is speciﬁed at time
Φi(t)

t = 0. The goal of control is to design such an exter-
nal ﬁeld F(t) that the wave packet calculated with Eq.
(1) up to time t = T is close enough to the desired target
. One of the most natural and
state wave packet
ﬂexible approaches to design such a ﬁeld is the optimal
control theory [19]. It is based on the idea that the con-
trolling laser pulse should maximize a certain functional.
The procedure leads to a set of equations for the optimal
laser ﬁeld, which include two Schr¨odinger equations to
describe the dynamics starting from the initial and tar-
get state wave packets. The optimal laser ﬁeld is given
by the imaginary part of the correlation function of these
two wave packets. This system of equations of optimal
control must be solved iteratively in general starting from
some initial guess ﬁeld.

A number of algorithms to realize this idea have been

developed [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. One of the most eﬀective is
the algorithm by Zhu, Botina and Rabits [23] (ZBR algo-
rithm), which is developed to solve the following system
of the optimal control equations:

Here γ is a positive parameter chosen to weight the sig-
niﬁcance of the laser energy [23]. To integrate Eq. (7)
forward in time and Eq. (8) backward in time, we employ
the close-coupling method discussed in subsection II A.

To launch the ZBR algorithm, an initial ﬁeld should
be speciﬁed.
In molecular dynamics control, which is
the main area of the application for the ZBR algorithm,
a zero initial ﬁeld is suﬃcient for most cases. However,
since in the present study initial and target states are sta-
tionary, a zero initial ﬁeld cannot be used. Instead we use
a single laser pulse of Gaussian shape as an initial ﬁeld
and generate diﬀerent optimal control ﬁelds by changing
its parameters. Our calculations show that three to ﬁve
iterations of the ZBR algorithm are suﬃcient to achieve
the convergence.

SELECTIVE EXCITATION OF THE

METASTABLE ATOMIC STATES BY
FEMTOSECOND PULSES

In the present section selective excitations of H(2s) and
He(1s2s 1S) by one and two femtosecond laser pulses of
Gaussian shape are studied. The case of chirp pulses
[8, 10, 11] or periodic chirping [16, 17] is not considered
as the pulse area required is larger than in the case of
non-chirped pulses. This in turn signiﬁcantly increases
the ionization. However, in some cases when the ioniza-
tion process is suppressed, periodic chirping can be used
to improve the robustness of the scheme. These will be
discussed in a future publication.

A. Selective excitation of H(2s) and He(1s2s 1S) by
a single laser pulse

In the simplest case a two-photon excitation of H(2s)
and He(1s2s 1S) can be achieved by using a single laser
pulse. The process can be aﬀected by changing only three
parameters of the laser: frequency, duration, and inten-
sity. To study this case we calculate the ﬁnal populations
of the target metastable states and ionization probabil-
ities as functions of intensity and duration of the laser

5

pulse for two-photon excitation of hydrogen (wavelength
is around 240 nm) and helium (wavelength is around 120
nm). The frequency of the laser was optimized for each
pair of the arguments to compensate level shifts due to
the dynamic Stark eﬀect and to maximize the output.

For the case of selective excitation of H(2s) the max-
imal values of the target state population achieved are
18 % to 20 %. Unfortunately, the corresponding ioniza-
tion probabilities are large, 27 % to 30 %. The maxi-
mal diﬀerences between the target state population and
ionization probability are found for the following set of
parameters:

FWHM [fs] = 2.25

where I is the pulse intensity. The target state popula-
tion and ionization probability are found to be 8.4 % and
4.2 %, respectively, for this set of FWHM and ω. Equa-
tions (10) are obtained by a ﬁt performed for the range
of intensities from 1 TW/cm2 to 20 TW/cm2.

The eﬃciency of the process is low because of sig-
niﬁcance of the one-photon ionization from the target
metastable state. As the photon energy is about 5.10
eV to 5.14 eV (depending on pulse intensity), this pro-
cess populates the continuum states with low energies
of about 1.7 eV, so that the corresponding bound-free
transition matrix elements are large.

An opposing situation is observed in the case of selec-
tive excitation of He(1s2s 1S). The best values of 65 %
for the target state population and 26 % for ionization
probability are found for the following parameters:

FWHM [fs] = 7.12

Eqations (11) are obtained by a ﬁt performed for the
range of intensities from 50 TW/cm2 to 400 TW/cm2.

The photon energy is about two times higher then in
the case of hydrogen (10.3 eV to 10.4 eV, depending on
pulse intensity). The process is eﬀective. One-photon
ionization from the target metastable state populates
the continuum states with energies of about 6.3 eV and
corresponding bound-free transition matrix elements are
small, so that ionization does not undermine the process.

B. Selective excitation of H(2S) by two laser pulses

To improve the eﬃciency of selective excitation of the
metastable state of hydrogen, we increase the number
of controlling parameters by introducing two controlling

Frequency of the "blue" pulse [eV]
 

FIG. 1: Selective excitation of H(2S) by two laser pulses:

laser pulses with diﬀerent frequencies instead of a sin-
gle pulse. For simplicity, we call the pulse with lower
frequency as “red” pulse and the pulse with higher fre-
quency as “blue” pulse. Frequencies of the blue and the
red pulses should be linked to ﬁt the energy diﬀerence be-
tween the ground and the metastable states. As optimal
intensity and duration of each pulse are approximately
related to each other by a pulse envelope area conser-
vation rule, in the present study we ﬁx durations of the
pulses to be equal.

Figure 1 presents the ﬁnal population of the metastable

state and ionization probability of hydrogen as functions
of frequency of the blue pulse for diﬀerent durations of
the pulses with the frequency of the red pulse, intensities
and central times of both pulses adjusted to maximize
the population of the metastable state.

If the frequency of the red pulse becomes lower than
the threshold of the one-photon ionization of the 2s
metastable state, the eﬃciency of the selective excitation
grows dramatically. This is caused by an abrupt decrease
of ionization rate, which makes it possible to apply more
intense laser pulses and achieve higher selective excita-
tion without increasing the ionization. Unfortunately,
for hydrogen the one-photon ionization threshold for the
2s state is equal to one third of the energy diﬀerence be-
tween the 1s and 2s states, and the simple case, when
the blue pulse is produced from the single red pulse by
the second harmonic generation, is still not good enough.
Acceptable results, however, can be obtained for the fre-
quencies of the blue pulse slightly higher and frequencies
of the red pulse slightly lower than the threshold val-
ues. An interesting observation comes from the analysis
of the time shift between the two optimized controlling
pulses. If the frequencies of the pulses are far from being
in resonance with some bound state, their centers coin-
cide. However, if the frequency of the blue pulse is close
to the frequency of 3p
1s transition, the centers of the
blue and the red pulses separate. In this case the direct
two-photon excitation process transforms into STIRAP
[12] (Table I, case 3).

Consider three examples in more detail:

Example 1. Final populations: 2s - 59 %, continuum
- 21 %. Parameters of the pulses. Freqencies: blue -
7.12786 eV, red - 3.13629 eV; Intensities: blue - 5.8
×
1012 W/cm2, red - 1.2
1013 W/cm2; FWHMs are 40 fs
for both pulses; Pulse centers coincide. The frequency of
the red pulse is below but close to the threshold of the
one-photon ionization of the H(2s) state. Although the
frequencies are adjusted to avoid resonances with highly
excited discrete states, 7p and 8p states are populated at
the level of 9 % and 3 % respectively.

1012 W/cm2, red - 1.6

Example 2. Final populations: 2s - 92 %, con-
tinuum - 7 %. Parameters of the pulses. Freqencies:
blue - 9.09943 eV, red - 1.09933 eV; Intensities: blue -
1012 W/cm2; FWHMs:
4.8
blue - 40 fs, red - 100 fs; Pulse centers coincide. In this
case durations of the pulses are diﬀerent and eﬃciency
of the process is less sensitive to the shifts between the
pulse centers.

1012 W/cm2, red - 4.0

Example 3. Final populations: 2s - 91 %, con-

100 fs for both pulses; blue pulse is delayed for 58 fs. The
frequencies of the pulses are close to be in resonance with
3p state. In this case the red pulse comes before the blue
pulse. This represents the STIRAP process [12].

rations can hardly be improved, we focus on the case of
short excitation times.

A typical example is shown in Fig. 2. It presents the
optimal control ﬁeld generated by the ZBR algorithm for
selective excitation of 1s2s 1S state of helium (top) and
the time variation of population of the target metastable
state and ionization probability during the interaction
(bottom). The calculations are performed starting from
the Gaussian pulse of intensity 80 TW/cm2, frequency
10.3 eV and FWHM 2.5 fs (full duration is 5 fs), which
is shown in the insert of Fig. 2. The weight parameter
is taken to be γ = 0.1. The ﬁnal population of the tar-
get state is 77 % with ionization probability 7 %. The
convergence is achieved in four iterations.

During optimization the laser ﬁeld completely trans-
forms into a sequence of attosecond pulses. The main
perturbations ﬁnish after 2 fs, so the duration of active
control is also changed. Contrary to the case of con-
trolling femtosecond pulses, the state populations now
change abruptly. Physically, the sequence of attosecond
laser pulses aﬀects the atomic electrons as a series of
pushes. Each push displaces the electrons for a small
distance so they can not move far from the atomic core,
and this suppresses ionization.

To simplify the optimal control ﬁeld obtained with the
ZBR algorithm we approximate it by a sequence of Gaus-
sians:

SELECTIVE EXCITATION OF THE

METASTABLE ATOMIC STATES BY
ATTOSECOND PULSES

In the previous sections the controlling laser ﬁeld was
assumed to be composed of a few femtosecond laser pulses
with Gaussian envelopes. To study other possibilities
to achieve selective excitation we use the optimal con-
trol theory, as described in Sec. II C. As the controlling
schemes introduced in the previous section for long du-

tum supplied to the electrons by each attosecond pulse
is given by the pulse area Aj and does not depend on
β. To calculate the parameters Aj and tj we roughly ap-
proximate the controlling ﬁeld by sequence (12) and use
the method described in Sec. II B to optimize Aj and tj.
The resulting sequence of attosecond pulses is presented
in Fig. 2 (top) as a bold line. The calculation is per-
formed with the width parameter β = 0.04 (FWHM =
20 as). The ﬁnal population of the target state and the
ionization probability for that ﬁeld are 81 % and 14 %,
respectively.

Figure 3 presents ﬁnal populations of the metastable
states and ionization probabilities obtained with the op-
timal ﬁelds generated from femtosecond pulses of diﬀer-
ent intensities and durations. Each point of the plot
represents an eﬀective controlling sequence of attosec-
ond pulses. One can see that the results depend on the
parameters of the initial guess pulse in a very compli-
cated way. The parameters for some eﬀective controlling
(12) calculated by
sequences of attosecond pulses Eq.
optimal ﬁtting of the parameters Aj and tj are presented
in the Table II.

Recently, q number of schemes to generate trains of
attosecond laser pulses have been proposed and realized
experimentally (see review [40]). The basic idea is the
production of a comb of equidistant frequencies in the
spectral domain with controlled relative phases. As a re-
sult trains of x-ray laser pulses of attosecond duration are
obtained. The shapes and carrier frequency can be mod-
iﬁed by eliminating certain harmonics. Also, waveforms
containing optical bursts approaching one cycle have
been successfully synthesized by superposing ﬁve phase-
controlled sidebands [41]. Trains of non-modulated at-
tosecond pulses could be also generated by laser-plasma
interaction in the relativistic regime (see [42] and refer-
ences therein.)

of 3.66 eV 2nd, 6th, 8th and 12th harmonics, respectively,
and so on.

V. CONCLUSIONS

8

In the present study the controlling ﬁeld search is per-
formed using a well established close-coupling approach
for solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, so
that all essential multiphoton eﬀects are treated accu-
rately. It is demonstrated that optimization procedures
provide an eﬀective technique to design laser ﬁelds for se-
lective excitation of metastable atomic states. Not only
do they reproduce the recently developed schemes of laser
control as particular cases but also they introduce new
ones.

An eﬃcient selective excitation of H(2s) and He(1s2s
1S) can be achieved by using one and two femtosecond
laser pulses. Frequencies of the pulses should be ad-
justed properly to suppress single-photon ionization from
the target metastable state. Optimal populations of the
atomic states and the corresponding parameters of the
laser pulses are calculated as functions of preferable fre-
quencies and durations of the pulses. These make it pos-
sible to choose the parameters of the controlling laser
pulses that ﬁt the capabilities of the present experimen-
tal techniques.

A new way to achieve selective excitation of metastable
atomic states by using sequences of attosecond pulses is
introduced. This is important because of recent progress
in production of attosecond pulses. While in the present
study the parameters of the pulses are calculated us-
ing the optimal control theory, the direct optimization
of high harmonics can be used to control the process in
the future.

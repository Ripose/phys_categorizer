Simple Soluble Molecular Ionization Model∗

Abstract

We present a simple exact analytical solution, using the Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira spectral
theorem, for the spectral function of the one-dimensional diatomic molecule model consisting
of two attractive delta function wells in the presence of a static external electric ﬁeld. For
suﬃciently deep and far apart wells, this molecule supports both an even and an odd state, and
the introduction of a static electric ﬁeld turns these bound states into quasi-bound states which
are Stark shifted and broadened. The continuum spectrum also inherits an intricate pattern of
resonances which reﬂect the competition between resonant scattering between the two atomic
wells and between the linear potential and one or both atomic well(s). All results are analytic
and can be easily plotted. The relation between the large orders of the divergent perturbative
Stark shift series and the non-perturbative widths of quasi-bound levels is studied.

Introduction

The electronic structure of atoms and molecules is usefully probed by external electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. The development of intense lasers has permitted such probing in regimes where simple per-
turbative treatments are not valid and one must use a nonperturbative semiclassical approximation
or a numerical approach. Experiments with molecules display a much richer range of phenomena
than with atoms, due to the additional molecular degrees of freedom [1, 2, 3]. These include above
threshold ionization [4, 5], multiple ionization [6, 7], alignment eﬀects [8], electron localization [9],
non-sequential double ionization [10], direct excitation [11], stabilization [12], dissociative recombi-
nation [13], and separation eﬀects [14]. However, molecules (even the simplest diatomic molecules)
and their ionization are clearly more diﬃcult to treat theoretically. Many approximation techniques
have been developed and applied to atomic ionization processes [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], but much less
is known for molecular systems. Realistic calculations are rather complicated and one loses some
of the physical intuition that can often be gained from simple models. In this paper we present
the exact analytical solution for a simple molecular ionization model. The molecule is taken to be
one-dimensional. This approximation is remarkably good in the strong-ﬁeld regime where the ion-
ization is predominantly along the ﬁeld direction, so that the system is eﬀectively one-dimensional

[8]. The simplest such one-dimensional molecule consists of two atomic wells1 represented by at-
tractive delta function wells of strength g, separated by a distance 2a. This is a well-known soluble
model [20]. This molecule always supports an even parity bound ground state and a continuum,
and if ag > 1 it also supports an odd parity bound excited state. There is a long tradition of using
model potentials such as zero-range potentials in atomic and molecular physics [21]. The presence
of an external electrostatic ﬁeld, of ﬁeld strength F , dramatically changes the basic character of
the spectrum, converting the bound states into quasi-bound states and modifying the resonance
structure of the continuum. These spectral changes are seen directly in the spectral function ρ(E) :
the quasi-bound states are poles of ρ(E) at complex values of the energy E, where the real part of
the pole gives the energy location of the quasi-bound level and the imaginary part gives the width,
and hence lifetime, of the level. Since this molecular ionization model is exactly soluble, we can
easily investigate the dependence of these quasi-bound levels on the relevant physical parameters
– the ﬁeld strength F , the atomic well depth g, and the atomic separation parameter a. The
same applies for the ”continuum”, where resonance structures appear due to the delicate interplay
between tunneling, binding and scattering eﬀects.

The solution presented here uses the Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira (WTK) spectral theorem [22, 23,
24, 25]. This spectral theorem expresses the completeness of the wavefunctions of the Schr¨odinger
equation in a general way that applies not just to the familiar discrete spectrum models (such as
the inﬁnite square well or the harmonic oscillator), but also to systems with discrete and continuum
spectra (such as the ﬁnite square well or the hydrogen atom), and even to systems with a purely
continuous spectrum, such as for ionization problems where there are no true bound states. The
WTK approach is well suited for numerical implementation and has been applied long ago to
the Stark eﬀect in atomic hydrogen [26]. An interesting soluble one-dimensional atomic model
consisting of a single ﬁnite square well on the half-line is solved using the WTK method in [27]. More
recently, the numerical WTK approach has been used for studying strong-ﬁeld ionization eﬀects
in eﬀectively one-dimensional diatomic molecules [28, 14]. Various numerical and approximate
methods for computing resonance locations and widths are compared in [29]. This current paper is
complementary to [28], but the choice to represent the atomic wells by delta function wells makes
the entire molecular ionization problem analytically solvable, thereby bypassing the numerical part
of the computation.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a summary of the implementation of the
Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira (WTK) method for computing the spectral function. This is applied
in Section 3 to the one-dimensional molecular model without an applied electric ﬁeld. In Section
4 the electric ﬁeld is applied and the exact solution for the spectral function is derived. The
dependence of the spectral function on the various physical parameters is explored through plots
and also analytically. Section 5 is devoted to the simpler case of atomic ionization, obtained from
the molecular solution by taking the atomic separation parameter, a, to zero.
In this case we
also study the large orders of perturbation theory for the Stark shift and show its relation to the
nonperturbative level width. The ﬁnal Section contains some concluding comments.

1It is straightforward to generalize the exact solution to the case of unequal atomic well depths, but for simplicity

here we consider the atomic well depths to be equal.

2 Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira Method

The Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira (WTK) spectral theorem [22, 23, 24, 25] for quantum mechanical
Hamiltonians is very general, covering not just simple Hamiltonians like the harmonic oscillator
which have only bound states, but also Hamiltonians with both bound and continuum states. It
also extends to ionization problems where the spectrum is purely continuum. Indeed, in his classic
book [23], Titchmarsh solves the half-line ”atomic” problem of a binding delta function potential
well plus a constant electric ﬁeld. This approach can be applied directly to any one-dimensional or
radial Schr¨odinger problem. The WTK method can be summarized as follows.

Consider the Schr¨odinger equation (we work in units where

~2
2m = 1):

ψ′′(x) + V (x)ψ = Eψ(x)

−

). Pick some point, chosen without loss of generality to be x = 0,
on the real line x
and normalize the two independent solutions of (1), u(x, E) and v(x, E), so that their Wronskian
is equal to 1 at that point by choosing:

(

u(0, E) = 1

v(0, E) = 0

,

,

u′(0, E) = 0
v′(0, E) =

, producing four functions u

Next, integrate (numerically or analytically) each of these solutions out towards x = +
and
(x, E). The WTK method involves constructing
x =
particular linear combinations of these functions such that these combinations are normalizable
on the intervals (0, +
, 0), when the energy E has a small positive imaginary part:

This WTK method is well suited to numerical implementation for arbitrary potential wells [28].
In the models studied in this paper the situation is even simpler, since the independent solutions
u(x, E) and v(x, E) are known in analytic form for all x; the ”integration” process simply involves
applying the correct continuity and discontinuity boundary conditions at the locations of the two
delta function potentials. This will be shown in detail in Section 4.

3 One-Dimensional Molecular Model

We ﬁrst review the model without the electric ﬁeld. We choose the following simple double-delta-
function potential to represent the diatomic molecule:

V (x) =

g [δ(x + a) + δ(x

a)]

a, and chosen for
where g > 0. This potential has two binding delta-function wells located at x =
simplicity to have equal strength
g. This problem, without an external electric ﬁeld, is a standard
problem in quantum mechanics courses [20]. The potential (6) always supports a bound ground
state which has even parity, and if ga > 1 it also supports a bound excited state which has odd
parity. In this section we present the WTK solution as an introductory illustration of the method.

In the vicinity of x = 0 the potential (6) vanishes. Thus, the two independent solutions, u(x, E)
and v(x, E), of the Schr¨odinger equation (1), which satisfy the normalization conditions (2) are

u(x, E) = cos(√E x)

,

v(x, E) =

Integrating to the right, these solutions remain valid until we reach the right-hand delta-function
at x = +a, at which point we impose the standard boundary conditions [20]:

exists). There is always an even bound state, given by the pole of m+(E) satisfying (15). If ga > 1
there is also an odd bound state, given by the zero of m+(E) satisfying (16). Some plots of the
spectral function (14) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Note the appearance of the single bound state
when ga < 1, but of two bound states when ga > 1. In Fig. 1 the width of the bound state peaks

behavior of the spectral function, due to resonant backscattering between the two delta-functions.
This periodicity is determined by the separation 2a between the wells, and the well strength g.

4 One Dimensional Molecular Model With an Electric Field

In this section we solve the problem of the one-dimensional molecular potential (6) studied in
the previous section, with an additional external static electric ﬁeld, of magnitude F . Thus, the
potential is

V (x) =

g [δ(x + a) + δ(x

a)]

(17)

where g > 0, and F > 0. The potential (17) has no bound states when F
= 0, but it does have
quasi-bound states. The corresponding Schr¨odinger equation (1) is analytically soluble since the
linearly independent solutions are Airy functions. In fact, the WTK solution proceeds exactly as in
the case without the electric ﬁeld, except that the basic trigonometric solutions in (7) are replaced
by Airy functions.

4.2 Plots of the Spectral Function

Before discussing the analytic properties of the spectral function (29), we present some plots which
illustrate how the spectral function depends on the physical parameters, in order to develop some
intuition for the physical processes involved. In addition, some animations showing how the spectral
function changes, both in the quasi-bound and in the quasi-continuum region, as we vary the ﬁeld
strength F , the atomic separation parameter a, or the atomic well depth parameter g can be found
at [31].

Figure 3: Plots of the spectral function (29) [solid lines] illustrating how the quasi-bound states
change as the electric ﬁeld strength F varies. The dashed line shows the corresponding F = 0
molecular spectrum (14. In these plots, the atomic well strength is g = 1.5, and the separation
parameter is a = 1, so the free molecule has two bound states. Notice that as F increases these
two states are Stark shifted and broadened.

In the absence of the electric ﬁeld, the molecule has one or two bound states depending on the
well separation parameter, a, and well strength, g. And the continuum exhibits structure due to
Ramsauer-Townsend resonances in the scattering between the two delta wells. These two features
are illustrated clearly in Figures 1 and 2. When the ﬁeld strength F is nonzero, the bound states
become quasi-bound states with a nonzero width, and their central values are Stark shifted. These
eﬀects are illustrated in Figure 3, which shows a molecule with two bound states subjected to an

Figure 4: Plots of the spectral function (29) [solid lines] illustrating how the continuum part of the
spectrum changes as the electric ﬁeld strength F varies. The dashed line shows the corresponding
F = 0 molecular spectrum (14).
In these plots, the atomic well strength is g = 1.5, and the
separation parameter is a = 1. Notice the two oscillation scales – the longer one is set by the free
case [dashed line], while the rapid oscillation is set by the ﬁeld strength F , with the free spectral
function providing an envelope. As F decreases in magnitude, the oscillations become more rapid,
eventually merging to the free case.

external electric ﬁeld of strengths F = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1. Note that the quasi-bound states broaden
as the ﬁeld increases, with the higher state being broader since it is less deeply bound and so can
tunnel more easily. The quasi-bound states are Stark shifted in opposite directions: the lower state
is Stark shifted down in energy, while the higher state is Stark shifted up in energy. The eﬀect of
the external electrostatic ﬁeld on the continuum states is shown in Figure 4. In these plots the
dashed line shows the continuum spectral function when F = 0. The solid lines show the spectral
function for various values of F : F = 0.5, 2, 5, 20. Note that the free spectral function provides an
envelope for the F > 0 spectral function. The scale of the oscillations of this envelope function
is clearly independent of F , being determined by the combination ag, as illustrated in Figure 2.
For F > 0 there is an additional scale in the ”continuum” spectrum, and as F decreases to zero
the rapid oscillations become more and more rapid, and eventually cancel out leaving the free
spectral function. As F increases the period of this oscillation increases. These oscillations can be
E/F 2/3), since these zeros give
correlated approximately with the zeros of the Airy function Ai(

peaks of the spectral function (the solid line) coincide roughly with the zeros of Ai(

providing the large period oscillations, and the electron scattering oﬀ the delta wells and the linear
electrostatic potential providing the shorter period oscillations.

4.2.2 Dependence on the atomic well separation parameter, a.

The dependence of the spectral function (29) on the atomic well separation parameter, a, is illus-
trated in Figures 7 and 8, for the ”bound” and ”continuum” parts of the spectrum, respectively.
In the zero ﬁeld case the spectral function has two bound states if ga > 1. These are shown as the
dashed curves in Figure 7. As the separation increases these two bound states approach the same
. This is because in the large separation limit the
energy, becoming degenerate in the limit a
tunneling which mixes the two levels becomes suppressed and the two atoms become essentially
independent of one another. Thus the bound state spectrum approaches that of a single atomic
well. On the other hand, if the ﬁeld strength is nonzero the quasi-bound states do not become
degenerate in the limit of large separation. This is shown by the solid curves in Figure 7. Instead,
the two states move away from each other; the even state is Stark shifted further down in energy
and the odd state is Stark shifted further up in energy. This is because for large a the tunneling is

essentially from each well independently, with one Stark shifted up and the other down, depending
on the parity of the original state. These quasi-bound levels also become narrower in width as
there is a larger barrier through which the electron must tunnel as a increases. The eﬀect on the
”continuum” part of the spectrum is shown in Figure 8. Here F = 0.15 and the spectrum exhibits
resonances which fall under the envelope of the F = 0 case, which is shown by the dashed lines. As
the well separation changes, the envelope function changes, due to the Ramsauer-Townsend reso-
nance between the two wells. Note that for nonzero ﬁeld strength the spectral function oscillates
rapidly with energy, but still falls approximately under the free ﬁeld envelope. Thus, the F > 0
spectral function represents a competition between the resonance between the two wells, which
depends strongly on a, and the resonance between a given well and the linear potential, which is
not sensitive to a.

4.2.3 Dependence on the atomic well strength, g.

The dependence of the spectral function (29) on the atomic well depth, g, is illustrated in Figures
9 and 10, for the ”bound” and ”continuum” parts of the spectrum, respectively. In the F = 0 case,
the diﬀerence in energy between the even and odd states gets smaller as the well strength increases,

of the spectrum changes as the well separation parameter a varies. The dashed line shows the
corresponding F = 0 molecular spectrum (14). For the solid lines, the ﬁeld strength is F = 0.1,
the well strength is g = 1.5, and a ranges through 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3. Notice that as a increases the
quasi-bound states become narrower in width and they move apart. In contrast, the free bound
states move together, eventually becoming degenerate as a

.

which is similar to what happens when the well separation increases. This is because the tunneling
mixing is more highly suppressed as the states become more deeply bound. The diﬀerence between
the limit of large well separation and the limit of large well strength is that as the well separation
increases the two bounded states approach the same energy, whereas when the well strength is
increased the states become degenerate but their energies tend to
. However, if the
electric ﬁeld is applied, the two states do not become degenerate in the large well strength limit but
instead keep a nonzero relative distance between each other. The distance between the two states
approaches 2F a as well strength increases, which is easily explained by the following argument.
If the well strength is very strong we can think of a particle being localized at a single well. If a
uniform electric ﬁeld of strength F pointing in the positive x-direction is applied, a particle localized
at the left well will increase in energy by F a while the energy of a particle localized at the right
well will decrease by F a. Since the unperturbed states have the same energy the energy diﬀerence
is just 2F a. This can be seen in the last panels of Figure 9, for which F = 0.1 and a = 1.5, so
2F a = 0.3, which is roughly the separation between the two quasi-bound levels. Also note that the
quasi-bound state peaks become narrower as g increases, as the levels are more deeply bound.

Figure 8: Plots of the spectral function (29) [solid lines] illustrating how the continuum part
of the spectrum changes as the well separation parameter a varies. The dashed line shows the
corresponding F = 0 molecular spectrum (14).
In these plots, the ﬁeld strength is F = 0.15,
and the well strength is g = 1. Notice that as a increases a second quasi-bound state peels oﬀ the
positive energy continuum and forms a Stark-shifted pair around the two F = 0 bound states which
exist for ag > 1. Also note that in the F = 0 case, as a increases the splitting between the two
bound states becomes vanishingly small, as the tunneling between the two wells is suppressed. In
the continuum, the envelope function varies with a due to resonances in the backscattering between
the two wells. Even with nonzero F the spectral function follows this envelope closely as a varies.

because the resonances are sharper, since the scattering potentials are deeper. If the ﬁeld is weak,
the WKB approximation for a inﬁnite well potential in a electric ﬁeld can be used to ﬁnd the energies
of the backscattering states in the strong well strength limit. But these peaks are also modulated
by the free ﬁeld envelope (the dashed lines in Figure 10), which is due to the resonance between the
wells without the electric ﬁeld. Thus, the F > 0 spectral function represents a competition between
the resonance between the two wells, which depends strongly on g, and the resonance between a
given well and the linear potential, which is also sensitive to the well strength g.

an even bound state of the F = 0 potential (6), while a solution to (35) satisfying (16) is an odd
bound state of (6).

The ﬁrst correction to these bound states comes from the F 2 term in the expansion of (30), which

To ﬁnd the shift for the even bound state, we ﬁnd the solution a0 of (52) which also satisﬁes (15),
and then insert this value of a0 into (36) to ﬁnd the corresponding a1.
It is straightforward to
continue this to higher orders.
(We study details of the higher orders in the Section 5 for the
special ”atomic” case where the atomic separation parameter a = 0.) For the odd bound state, we
must ﬁrst ﬁnd if there is such a solution for a0 to (52) satisfying (16). This odd solution will exist
if ga > 1. If it exists, then the corresponding Stark shift is obtained by inserting this value of a0
into the expression (36) for a1.

The widths of the quasi-bound states can be derived from the imaginary part of the poles of the
spectral function. Because of the complicated dependence of the quasi-bound state energies on the
system parameters F , g and a, it is diﬃcult to derive simple analytical expressions for the line

studied in Section 4 can be obtained simply by setting the separation parameter, a, of the two wells
to zero. All the expressions carry over smoothly in this a
0 limit. The corresponding potential
is (note that the delta function strength becomes 2g in this limit):

5.2 Large-Order Perturbation Theory and Level Widths.

It is well known that perturbation theory for an unstable quasi-bound state produces a divergent
non-alternating series, with which an imaginary part can be associated using Borel techniques.
This was ﬁrst explicitly investigated for the unstable x2 + gx3 anharmonic potential [34], then in
extensive detail for the x2 +λx4 potential [35], and is a very general property of perturbation theory
[36, 37]. The same ideas apply to the Stark eﬀect problem, as has been investigated exhaustively
for atomic systems [38, 39, 40, 41].

The quasi-bound states correspond to poles of the spectral function, namely solutions to

exponentially small in the small F limit, and so can be neglected. Thus the real part is determined

Table 1: This table lists the coeﬃcients an appearing in the perturbative expansion (48) for the
quasi-energy level fo the atomic system in an electric ﬁeld. Note that these coeﬃcients are non-
alternating in sign, and that their magnitude, N [an], grows very fast with the perturbative order
n, as is shown in the third column. The fourth column shows the ratio of the an to the leading
factorial growth rate in (52), and the ﬁfth column gives the fourth-order Richardson extrapolation
[42] of this ratio, showing its rapid approach to unity.

21

In the small F limit we can use the asymptotic expansions (31,32) of the Airy functions to make
an expansion of (51) in powers of (F/g3)2, thereby successively determining the coeﬃcients an.
It is trivial to program this expansion in Mathematica, and the results for the ﬁrst 21 expansion
coeﬃcients are shown in Table 1 [43].

Notice that all the an have the same sign, and their magnitude grows very rapidly. In fact, the
leading growth rate at large orders n of the perturbation series is factorially fast:

(cid:19)
The last two columns of Table 1 show how quickly this leading growth rate is achieved. The ﬁnal
column uses fourth order Richardson extrapolation [42] for the ratio of the exact coeﬃcients to the
leading behavior in (52), and the rapid onset to the leading growth shows that after 10 terms one
is already well and truly into the asymptotic regime described by (52).

(cid:18)

Since the perturbative series (48) for the energy is divergent and non-alternating, it is not Borel
summable [42]. However, one can associate an imaginary part with such a divergent series using
standard Borel dispersion relations [34, 35, 36, 37]. This technique provides a bridge between
perturbative and nonperturbative physics, and is well studied in a wide variety of physics contexts
[36]. The argument can be motivated and illustrated roughly as follows. Consider the following
alternating divergent series obtained by an asymptotic expansion of the integral

where c > 0. The integral on the left-hand-side of (53) is the Borel sum of the alternating divergent
series of the right-hand-side. This argument does not work for the corresponding nonalternating
∞n=0 c2nΓ(2n), as one would encounter a pole on the t integration axis. The behavior at
series,
such a pole must be deﬁned by some sort of prescription. The standard principal parts prescription
associates with this non-alternating divergent series a non-perturbative imaginary part [36, 37]

(53)

P

Thus, using the leading growth rate (52) for the perturbative coeﬃcients an we see that this Borel
approach associates an imaginary part for the quasi-bound energy level equal to

This agrees precisely with the imaginary part (50) found directly from the properties of the Airy
functions, as well as with a simple WKB estimate.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have presented the exact analytic solution for the spectral function for the simple
one-dimensional molecular ionization model of a diatomic molecule represented by two attractive

22

delta function wells in an external static electric ﬁeld. The Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira spectral
theorem provides a simple construction for the spectral function in terms of suitably normalized
solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation.
In this case these solutions are Airy functions, and the
spectral function can be expressed in closed form in terms of Airy functions. Thus, the spectral
function can easily be plotted using a program such as Mathematica [33]. The dependence of the
spectral function on the relevant physical parameters, the ﬁeld strength F , the well strength g,
and the well separation parameter a, is illustrated in Section 4 by a collection of plots. This helps
develop a body of intuition for the behavior of the quasi-bound states as they are Stark shifted and
broadened, and also for the resonance structures in the ”continuum”, which reﬂect a competition
between Ramsauer-Townsend resonant scattering between the two atomic wells and between one
or both atomic well(s) and the linear ﬁeld potential. The most important extension of this model
would be to consider the eﬀect of time-dependence in the background electric ﬁeld, which introduces
yet another physical scale into the problem [44, 45, 46, 47, 48].

Theoretial determination of hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstant is one of most stringent tests of atomi wave

funtions near the nuleus. Also aurate predition of hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstants and other related

properties (viz. transition energies) requires preise inorporation of relativisti and higher orrelation

and relaxation e(cid:27)ets as these e(cid:27)ets are strongly entangled.

In partiular, the hyper(cid:28)ne oupling

onstant alulations are relevant to the parity non-onservation study in atoms beause the eletro-

weak interation is also a short range fore.

The relativisti and dynamial eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets an be inorporated in many-eletron sys-

tems through a variety of many-body methods. The oupled luster method (CCM) has emerged as

one of the most powerful and e(cid:27)etive tool for a high preision desription of eletron orrelations in

many-eletron systems. The CCM is an all-order non-perturbative sheme, and therefore, the higher

order eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets an be inorporated more e(cid:30)iently than using the order-by-order dia-

grammati many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The CC method is size-extensive, a property whih

has been found to be ruial for an aurate determination of state energies, bond leavage energies and

related spetrosopi onstants. Sine the order-by-order MBPT expansion terms are diretly related

to the CC equations (as the latter is an all-order version of the former sheme), the CC results an be

improved by adding the important omitted diagrams with the aid of low order MBPT.

and Weiman [1℄. The magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstant of 6P3/2

Cs have been arried out by Tanner

state have also been determined from this high preision experiment.

In this artile, we report the

magneti dipole (A) and eletri quadrupole (B ) hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstant of 6P3/2 state of Cesium

atom obtained from the RCC method to aess the performane and auray of the RCC sheme. We

reiterate that aurate omputation of hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstants requires preise inorporation of

eletron orrelations and aurate desription of the wave funtions near the nuleus.

The relativisti hyper(cid:28)ne energy W for states J = L ± 1

2 is given by

W = A(I.J) + B

6(I.J)2 + 3(I.J) − 2((I.I)(J.J)
2I(I − 1)2J(J − 1)

,

where I is the nulear spin. A and B are, respetively, the oe(cid:30)ients of magneti dipole and eletri
quadrupole ontribution to the hyper(cid:28)ne struture. The radial matrix elements related to A and B are
available elsewhere [2℄. [Note that B=0 for J = 1

We employ the straight forward extension of non-relativisti open-shell oupled luster theory to the

relativisti regime by adopting the no-virtual-pair approximation (NVPA) along with appropriate mod-

i(cid:28)ation of orbital form and potential terms [3℄. We begin with Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian (HD )

The valene universal Fok spae open-shell oupled luster method is employed whih begins with the

deomposition of the full many-eletron Hilbert spae of dimension N into into a referene spae M0 of
dimension M ≪ N , de(cid:28)ned by the pro jetor P , and its orthogonal omplement M⊥
pro jetor Q = 1 − P . A valene universal wave operator Ω is then introdued whih satis(cid:28)es

0 assoiated with the

where |Ψ(0)
i and |Ψii are the unperturbed and the exat wave funtions of the ith eigenstate of the
Hamiltonian, respetively. The wave operator Ω, whih formally represents the mapping of the referene
spae M0 onto the target spae M spanned by the M eigenstates |Ψii, has the properties

where H
the energies Ei , i = 1, . . . , M , are omputed by diagonalizing the e(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian H
in the M -
dimensional referene spae M0 . Following Lindgren's formulation of open-shell CC [4℄, we express the
valene universal wave operator Ω as

e(cid:27)

Ω = {exp(S)},

where S is the exitation operator and urly brakets denote the normal ordering.

One Ψi is known, the one-eletron properties hOi are evaluated from the following expression

In the atual alulations, the ground and exited state properties of Cs are omputed using the (cid:28)nite

basis set expansion method (FBSE) [5℄ with a large basis set of Gaussian funtions of the form

with k = 0, 1, . . . for s, p, ... type funtions, respetively. For the exponents, the even tempering ondition

is applied. Here, N is the number of basis funtions for a spei(cid:28) symmetry. The starting point of this
+

alulation is the generation of DF orbitals for Cs

whih de(cid:28)nes the (0,0) valene setor of the Fok

spae. The ion is then orrelated by CCSD and one-eletron is then added, following the Fok-spae

Cs(I=7/2) obtained from the CC method with the experiment [1℄ and with linearized CC alulations

[7, 8℄. We also report the 6s → 6p3/2 transition dipole matrix to demonstrate the onsisteny of this

method. Our omputed magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne oupling matrix elements are

quite aurate [o(cid:27) by 0.143 MHz for the magneti dipole and 0.02 MHz for eletri quadrupole ase℄. The

CC transition dipole matrix element reported here is also in exellent agreement with the experiment

[9℄. Finally, we emphasize that to our knowledge no prior eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne CC alulations

are available for 6P3/2 state of Cs atom.

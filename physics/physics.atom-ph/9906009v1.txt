Although the convergent close-coupling (CCC) method has
achieved unprecedented success in obtaining accurate theo-
retical cross sections for electron-atom scattering, it generally
fails to yield converged energy distributions for ionization.
Here we report converged energy distributions for ionization
of H(1s) by numerically integrating Schr¨odinger’s equation
subject to correct asymptotic boundary conditions for the
Temkin-Poet model collision problem, which neglects angular
momentum. Moreover, since the present method is complete,
we obtained convergence for all transitions in a single calcu-
lation (excluding the very highest Rydberg transitions, which
require integrating to inﬁnitely-large distances; these cross
sections may be accurately obtained from lower-level Rydberg
cross sections using the 1/n3 scaling law). Complete results,
accurate to 1%, are presented for impact energies of 54.4 and
40.8 eV, where CCC results are available for comparison.

(TP) model

The Temkin-Poet

[1,2] of electron-
hydrogen scattering is now widely regarded as an ideal
testing ground for the development of general methods
intended for the full three-body Coulomb problem. Al-
though only s-states are included for both projectile and
atomic electrons, this model problem still contains most
of the features that make the real scattering problem hard
to solve. Indeed, even in this simpliﬁed model, converged
energy distributions for ionization can not generally be
obtained via the close-coupling formalism [3]. Any gen-
eral method that can not obtain complete, converged
results for this model problem will face similar diﬃcul-
ties when applied to the full electron-hydrogen system.
Therefore we believe it is essential to develop a numerical
method capable of solving the TP model completely be-
fore angular momentum is included. Here we report such
a method. Complete, precision results for e− + H(1s), ac-
curate to 1%, are presented for total energies of 3 and 2
Rydbergs (Ryd). Atomic units (Ryd energy units) are
used throughout this work unless stated otherwise.

Our numerical method may be summerized as follows.
The model Schr¨odinger equation is integrated outwards
from the atomic center on a grid of ﬁxed spacing h. The
number of diﬀerence equations is reduced each step out-
wards using an algorithm due to Poet [4], resulting in a
propagating solution of the partial-diﬀerential equation.
By imposing correct asymptotic boundary conditions on
this general, propagating solution, the particular solu-
tion that physically corresponds to scattering is obtained
along with the scattering amplitudes.

To convert the partial-diﬀerential equation (1) into dif-
ference equations we impose a grid of ﬁxed spacing h and
approximate derivatives by ﬁnite diﬀerences. After ap-
plying the Numerov scheme in both the x and y direc-
tions, our diﬀerence equations have the form [4]

(13)

Here the matrix I(i) contains the incident part of the
asymptotic solution while R(i) contains the reﬂected
part. The asymptotic solution is identical to the full
solution, Eq. (4), except that the quadrature over the
continuum extends only up to the total energy E. The
inﬁnite summation over discrete channels is truncated to
some ﬁnite integer Nd and the quadrature over the two-
electron continuum is performed prior to matching by
ﬁrst writing the Cǫbi as a power series in ǫb:

Cǫbi ≈

Nc

Xn=1

cniǫn
b .

(14)

The matching procedure then determines the (in prac-
tice, much smaller set of) coeﬃcients cni, rather than
the Cǫbi directly, which eliminates ill conditioning [4].

To extract an N

N coeﬃcient matrix, where N =
Nd + Nc, we need only N of the i equations (10). Alter-
natively, one may use all i equations as in Poet [4]. In this

×

case, the system of equations is overdetermined. Never-
theless, a solution can be found by the standard method
of minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals
[the diﬀerences between the left- and right-hand sides of
equations (10)]. Previously [5], we found that the least-
squares method is generally stabler than keeping any sub-
set of just N equations (10).

Our numerical method is stable and rapidly conver-
gent. For a given grid spacing h, we established conver-
gence in propagation distance by performing the match-
ing every 40 a.u. until convergence was obtained. At
each matching radius, both the number of discrete chan-
nels Nd and the number of expansion functions for the
continuum Nc were varied to obtain convergence. Fi-
nally, the entire calculation was repeated for a ﬁner grid
(using one-half the original grid spacing h).

The biggest advantage of having a general, propagating
solution is that once the grid spacing is chosen, a “single”
calculation is all that is needed to establish convergence
for the remaining numerical parameters. This is because
the D-matrix, the calculation of which consumes nearly
all the computational eﬀort, is independent of asymptotic
boundary conditions. Thus, in a typical calculation, the
same D-matrix is used for, e.g., Nc = 0, 1, . . . , 9 while
Nd runs from 1 to 30. This would have required 300
completely separate calculations (each taking about the
same time as our “one” calculation) had we solved the
original global matrix equations (9).

e− + H(ns), n

We have performed complete calculations for electrons
colliding with atomic hydrogen at impact energies of 54.4
and 40.8 eV (total energies of 3 and 2 Ryd, respectively).
In Table I, we present our calculated cross sections for
e− + H(1s)
8. The grid spacing is
h = 1/5 a.u. (results using one-half this spacing diﬀered
by less than 0.1% for discrete excitations and 0.5% for
elastic scattering). One of the advantages of our direct
approach is that we are able to obtain the amplitudes
for higher-level (Rydberg) transitions as easily as those
for low-level excitations, provided the matching radius is
large enough to enclose the ﬁnal Rydberg state. This is
in contrast to some other approaches, such as the CCC,
which lose accuracy for higher-level transitions.

We note also the recent work of Miyashita et al. [9],
who have presented SDCS for total energies of 4, 2, and
0.1 Ryd using two diﬀerent methods. One produces an
asymmetric energy distribution similar to that of CCC
while the other gives a symmetric distribution. Both
contain oscillations. The mean of their symmetric curve
at E = 2 Ryd (40.8 eV impact energy) is in reasonable
agreement with our calculations.

In conclusion, we have presented complete, precision
results for the Temkin-Poet electron-hydrogen scattering
problem for impact energies of 54.4 and 40.8 eV. It may
be possible to improve the speed of the present method by
using a variable-spaced grid, like that used by Botero and
Shertzer [10] in their ﬁnite-element analysis (this would
greatly reduce storage requirements as well). Once we
have optimized our code for this simpliﬁed model we will
proceed to include angular momentum. When angular
momentum is included, the ionization boundary condi-
tion is no longer separable and this is the major chal-
lenge for generalizing the present approach to the full
electron-hydrogen scattering problem.

In Figures 1-4, we present our results (labeled FDM for
ﬁnite-diﬀerence method) for the single-diﬀerential cross
section (SDCS). For a total energy of 3 Ryd, 240 a.u.
proved to be a suﬃcient matching radius to get conver-
gence of the SDCS and for E = 2 Ryd, a radius of 360 a.u.
was required. The SDCS is more sensitive to the number
of expansion functions for the continuum than the other
observables, particularly about ǫb = E/2. Nevertheless,
convergence to better than 1% was readily obtained us-
ing 7-8 functions (the largest discrepancy in the SDCS
between Nc = 7 and Nc = 8 was smaller than 0.3%; even
using just 6 expansion function gave results accurate to
1%).

Also shown in Figs. 1-4 are the results of convergent
close-coupling (CCC) calculations [3]. The CCC method
of Bray [3] employs a “distinguishable electron” prescrip-
tion, which produces energy distributions that are not
symmetric about ǫb = E/2. Stelbovics [8] has shown that
a properly symmetrized CCC amplitude yields SDCS
that are symmetric about E/2 as well as being four
times larger at ǫb = E/2 than those assuming distin-
guishable electrons. (Note that our singlet FDM results
at ǫb = E/2 are about four times larger than the corre-
sponding CCC results.) Other than making the energy
distributions symmetric, it is clear from the ﬁgures that
symmetrization (coherent summation of the CCC ampli-
tudes Cǫbi and Cǫai, where ǫa = E
ǫb, which corre-
spond to physically indistinguishable processes) will sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀect only singlet scattering (and then only
near ǫb = E/2), since Cǫbi is practically zero for ǫb >
E/2. For singlet scattering, the CCC oscillates about the
true value of SDCS, except near (and beyond) ǫb = E/2.
CCC results for triplet scattering, on the other hand, are
E/2.
in very good agreement with our results for 0
Some very recent results from Baertschy et al. [6] have
also been included in the ﬁgures. Baertschy et al. re-
arrange the Schr¨odinger equation to solve for the outgo-
ing scattered wave. They use a two-dimensional grid like
ours, but scale the coordinates by a complex phase factor
beyond a certain radius where the tail of the Coulomb po-
tential is ignored. As a result, the scattered wave decays
like an ordinary bound state beyond this cut-oﬀ radius,
which makes the asymptotic boundary conditions very
simple. By computing the outgoing ﬂux directly from
the scattered wave at several large cut-oﬀ radii, and ex-
trapolating to inﬁnity, they obtain the single-diﬀerential
ionization cross section without having to use Coulomb
three-body boundary conditions. This method, called
exterior complex scaling (ECS), has just been extended
to the full electron-hydrogen ionization problem [7]. It
is seen from Figs. 1-4 that the ECS results are in good
agreement with our FDM results except when the energy
fraction ǫb/E approaches 0 or 1. Baertschy et al. [6] note
that their method may be unreliable as ǫb approaches 0
or E due to “contamination” of the ionization ﬂux by
contributions from discrete excitations.

Abstract

We consider the problem of an atomic beam propagating quantum mechanically through an

atom beam splitter. Casting the problem in an adiabatic representation (in the spirit of the

Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecular physics) sheds light on explicit eﬀects due to non-

adiabatic passage of the atoms through the splitter region. We are thus able to probe the fully three

dimensional structure of the beam splitter, gathering quantitative information about mode-mixing,

splitting ratios,and reﬂection and transmission probabilities.

INTRODUCTION

Continuing advances in the production and manipulation of atomic Bose-Einstein con-

densates (BEC’s) are tending toward novel applications in interferometry. BEC’s can now

be produced in situ on surfaces [1, 2, 3], making them ready for loading into “interferometer-

on-a-chip” micro-structures. Being in close proximity to the chip, the atoms are subject to

control via magnetic ﬁelds generated by wires on the chip. Because of their coherence and

greater brightness, Bose- condensed atoms are expected to improve upon previous accom-

plishments with thermal atoms, such as neutral atom guiding, [4, 6, 7, 8, 9], switching [10],

and multi-mode beamsplitting [11, 12]. Studies of propagation of BEC’s through waveguide

structures are also underway [13].

While the BEC is created in its lowest transverse mode in the guiding potential, keeping it

in this mode as it travels through the chip remains remains a signiﬁcant technical challenge.

For example, it appears that inhomogeneities in the guiding wires produce ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

that can break up the condensate wave function [13, 14]. Additionally, the very act of

splitting a condensate into two paths implies a transverse pull on the condensate that can

excite higher modes.

Ideally, the condensate propagates suﬃciently slowly that, once in

its lowest mode, it follows adiabatically into the lowest mode of the split condensate. The

criterion for this to happen, roughly, is that the condensate velocity in the direction of

motion be less than Lω, where L is a characteristic length scale over which the beam is

split, and ω is a characteristic frequency of transverse oscillation in the guiding potential.

Reference [15] has veriﬁed this conclusion numerically, in a two-dimensional model that

varies the transverse potential in time, at a rate equivalent to the passage of the moving

condensate through a beam splitter. Populating higher modes can reduce fringe contrast,

thus spoiling the operation of an interferometer. Diﬀraction has also been pointed out to

have negative eﬀects on guiding in general [16].

Moving too slowly through the beam splitter is, however, potentially dangerous because

of threshold scattering behavior in a varying potential. In one dimension, a wave incident on

a scattering potential is reﬂected with unit probability in the limit of zero collision energy

[17]. This same kind of “quantum reﬂection” will be generically present in beam splitters as

well, where scattering can occur from changes in the transverse potential as the longitudinal

coordinate varies. Reﬂection upon entering the beam splitter region can prove devastating

2

for potential applications such as a Sagnac interferometer.

Both aspects of instability in an atom interferometer can be expressed in terms of quan-

tum mechanical scattering theory of the atoms from the guiding potential. Speciﬁcally, a

condensate entering a beam splitter in arm a and in transverse mode m possesses a scat-

tering amplitude Sam,a′m′ for exiting in arm a′ in mode m′. In this paper we therefore cast

the general problem of beam splitting in terms of scattering theory. For the time being we

restrict our attention to the linear scattering problem, and therefore implicitly consider the

regime of weak inter-atomic interactions. This is suitable, since the basic question we raise

is the eﬀect of wave mechanical propagation on the atoms. Note that the weakly interacting

atom limit is achieved with small atom number, in which case number ﬂuctuations may be

problematic [18]. Alternatively, this limit is reached at low atom density, which is achieved

for a BEC that has expanded longitudinally for some time before entering the beam splitter

region.

Restricting our attention to the linear Schr¨odinger equation opens up a host of powerful

theoretical tools that have been developed in the context of atomic scattering.

In the

present instance, given the dominant role of non-adiabatic eﬀects, the tool of most use is

the adiabatic representation. This is analogous to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in

molecular physics [19]. Speciﬁcally, we freeze the value of the longitudinal coordinate z and

solve the remaining 2-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation in x-y. The resulting z-dependent

energy spectrum represents a set of potential curves for following the remaining motion in

z. This general approach has been applied previously to a model situation in which the

transverse potential is gently contracted or expanded [16, 20]; here we extend it to realistic

waveguide geometries.

This representation has obvious appeal for the problem at hand, since in this level of ap-

proximation it is assumed that the atoms move inﬁnitely slowly through the beam splitter.

It is, however, an exact representation of scattering theory, and the leftover non-adiabatic

corrections, arising from ﬁnite propagation velocity, can be explicitly incorporated. We will

see that non-adiabatic eﬀects have a strong inﬂuence on beamsplitters based on experi-

mentally realistic parameters. The eﬀects of excitation of higher transverse modes and of

reﬂection from the beam splitter therefore have a fairly simple interpretation in these explicit

nonadiabticites. In addition, the successive solution of a set of two-dimensional problems in

transverse coordinates x

y, followed by a coupled-channel calculation in z, is less numer-

−

3

ically intensive than than determining the full 3-dimensional solution all at once. Indeed,

this is why adiabatic representations have found widespread use in chemical physics. Larger

problems, more closely resembling experimental beam splitters, can therefore be handled.

This paper is organized as follows: In section II we introduce the model, describing how

the beamsplitter works in general terms and outlining the theoretical methods used in the

paper, introducing the main ideas about the adiabatic formalism. In section III we present

the results obtained from our study, with a focus on the description of the theory itself, and

how its diﬀerent components relate to the physics of the problem.

II. MODEL

The salient characteristics of a two wire atomic beam-splitter can be realized in the

following way: a guiding potential is generated by the magnetic ﬁeld due to two parallel

current carrying wires and an additional bias ﬁeld perpendicular to them. By suitably

decreasing the bias ﬁeld or the distance between the wires, it is possible to decrease the

separation between two minima, and thus increase the probability for the atoms to tunnel

from one to another.

A. The Beam Splitting Potential.

We start by considering the magnetic ﬁeld generated by two inﬁnitely long parallel wires

lying on a substrate, each carrying a current I in the ˆz direction. Deﬁning the plane of the

substrate as the x

z plane, we let the z axis lie exactly between the wires, and let y axis

point to the region above the substrate. [21]

−

We then proceed with the addition of two bias ﬁelds, one in the ˆz direction, Bbz, and

one in the ˆx direction, Bbx. The ﬁrst of the two is put in place in order to avoid regions of

exactly zero ﬁeld, where Majorana transitions would cause arbitrary spin ﬂips, and therefore

loss of atoms from the guide. The second of the two ﬁelds, when added vectorially to the

ﬁeld generated by the wires, generates regions of minimum potential in the x

z plane.

In particular, for B0

bx = µ0I/2πd ,where µ0 is the permeability of free space, and d is the

separation between the wires, there exists a single potential minimum located on the y axis

−

a distance y0 = d above the wires.

4

Furthermore, for Bbx < B0

bx two minima are generated on the y axis, one above and one

below y0, and for Bbx > B0

bx, two minima are again generated above the substrate, but this

time they are displaced symmetrically to the left and the right of the y

z plane.

It is

−

this latter regime that we use to generate a beam splitter, letting the wires be ﬁxed, and

changing the transverse bias ﬁeld Bbx as a function of z from Bmax to Bmin and back, such

that Bmax > Bmin > B0

bx.

The magnetic ﬁeld produced by such conﬁguration is therefore [18, 21]

and the consequent potential experienced by the atoms is

where µB is the Bohr magneton, gF is the Land´e factor, mF is the total angular momentum

projection quantum number, and the atoms’ spin is aligned with the ﬁeld at every point in

space. An example of a guiding potential is illustrated in Fig 1.

The adjustable experimental parameters are therefore the current in the wires I, the val-

ues of the bias ﬁelds Bmax , Bmin and Bbz, and the distance d between the wires. Throughout

this work we choose, for concreteness, d = 0.1µm, Bmin = 21.3G, Bmax = 22.5G, Bbz = 1.0G,

L = 20µm, and we let Bbx(z) be a fourth order polynomial in z, such that it has zero deriva-

tive at the center ( z = 0) and edges (z =

L) of the beam splitter. Also we will only

±
consider cases in which Bbx(z) reaches its minimum value at z = 0 only, avoiding the char-

acterization of the trivial evolution of the wave function at a constant ﬁeld. In particular

we will consider the following form for the variation of the transverse bias ﬁeld:

Bbx(z) = Bmim + (Bmin

Bmax)

contour is drawn at the energy of the lowest mode of the input arm of the beamsplitter, and we

deﬁne “left” and “right” arms for labeling convenience.

B. Waveguides as a Scattering Problem

Because we are going to treat the beamsplitter as a scattering problem, we will begin

by oﬀering a quick review of scattering theory; in particular we will reproduce the basic

formulation of the adiabatic treatment of the scattering problem.

Scattering theory is fundamentally based on the superposition principle, which constrains

us to the solution of the linear Schr¨odinger equation. This limit is nonetheless justiﬁable

in light of the known problems caused by the interaction between atoms, such as the wave

function recombination instabilities described in Ref.[22].

The separation between the guides at the input and output ports of the beam-splitter

is suﬃciently great that no tunneling is possible between the guides within the time frame

of the experiment. The problem is thus divided into two separate regions. We will refer to

the region

< L as the scattering region. This is the inner region containing the active

z

|

|

part of the beam-splitter, where all the coupling between the modes takes place.

In the

outer region, deﬁned by

> L,the potential has translational symmetry in z. Solutions

z

|

|

to the Schr¨odinger equation in the outer region are therefore trivially found to be products

of transverse modes and longitudinal plane-wave solutions. The problem is thus reduced to

6

ﬁnding solutions inside the scattering region, and match them to the solutions outside to

ﬁnd solutions to the global problem. Once these solutions are found it is then possible to

generate the S-matrix for the system.

Moreover, since we are matching at the boundary of the scattering region the only infor-

mation we need is the value of the wave function and its derivative at the boundary, and

nowhere else. In particular we need to compute the quantity

Because the wave function must vanish in the limit of large

Ψ(x, y, z) = EΨ(x, y, z),

with V (x, y, z) as deﬁned in Eq.(2). If atoms in the guide were moving inﬁnitely slowly , i.e.

adiabatically, then the wave function would be well represented by the basis set φi(x, y; z)

with eigenvalues Ui(z), deﬁned as solutions to the equation

¯h2
2m ∇

"−

x,y + V (x, y; z)

φi(x, y; z) = U(z)φi(x, y; z).

(6)

As in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the quantities Ui(z) serve as eﬀective potentials

for the subsequent motion in z. To recover the eﬀect of ﬁnite velocity in z, it would be

appropriate to expand the wave function in terms of the adiabatic basis in the following

way:

Ψ(x, y, z) =

Fj(z)φj(x, y; z),

(7)

where the z dependence of the coeﬃcient Fi(z) is necessary in order to restore the motion

in the z coordinate. We should note that the above deﬁned basis functions depend only

#

j

parametrically on z, and they are normalized in the following way:

φi(x, y; z)φj(x, y; z)dxdy = δi,j.

(8)

Z

This normalization implies that all transverse functions must vanish as x, y

, and

therefore deﬁnes the eﬀective boundary of the scattering region as z =

L.

Having deﬁned the basis set we proceed to insert Eqn. (7) into Eqn. (5), and subsequently

project the resulting equation onto φi(x, y; z), to obtain the set of coupled equations

P and Q are operators of momentum-like and kinetic energy-like quantities, and thus reﬂect

the inﬂuence of ﬁnite propagation velocity in z. Notice that P and Q vanish by construction

in the outer region.

We have thus cast the original 3-dimensional problem into a collection of 2-dimensional

problems to ﬁnd φi(x, y; z) and Ui(z), and a 1-dimensional coupled channel problem to ﬁnd

Fi(z). The advantages of this shift in paradigm are twofold: on the one hand, a very com-

plicated and computationally lengthy problem is turned into a simpler and computationally

manageable problem; On the other hand, the adiabatic approach lends itself very naturally

to approximations and qualitative understanding of the underlying physics.

D. The R-Matrix Method

As mentioned earlier, solving the scattering problem implies ﬁnding the logarithmic

derivative b as deﬁned in Eq.(4).

In atomic structure physics, there is a well known

variational principle for the logarithmic derivative, which follows rather simply from the

Schr¨odinger equation [23]:

The typical approach to the problem, at this point is to expand the wave function in

a complete set of basis functions Yk, to get Ψ(x, y, z) =

ZΣ

This is the form that the eigenchannel R-matrix takes in a diabatic representation.

The solutions of the eigenvalue problem consists of a set of eigenvectors C σ, and a set

of eigenvalues bσ, representing the logarithmic derivatives of the functions Ψσ =

k C σ

k Yk.

The newly introduced index σ refers to the diﬀerent possible internal states of the system,

P

called R-matrix eigenchannels. The concept of eigenchannel in scattering theory can be

understood by analogy with the concept of eigenstate in bound state problems.

In fact,

just like the energy variational principle leads to an eigenvalue problem for bound state

eigenfunction and corresponding energies, the variational principle in Eq.(12) leads to a set

of eigenchannels, with corresponding eigen-logarithmic derivatives.

As we mentioned earlier, we plan to work using the adiabatic basis deﬁned in Eq.(7), so

we expand Eq.(12) in terms of this set, and obtain the following variational principle:

write the adiabatic equivalent to Eq.(13).

In the above equations we have written the P-matrix portion of Eq.(16) in an Hermitian

form by integrating by parts, and setting the resulting surface integral to zero, using the

fact that by deﬁnition all couplings P, Q must vanish outside the scattering region.

E. The Outer Region: Matching and Physical Consideration

Having solved Eq.(17), one obtains a set of eigenvalues bσ, and a set of eigenvectors ~cσ.

It therefore follows that on the boundaries Σ of the scattering region we can connect the

inner and outer solutions by:

Ψσ(x, y, Σ) =

(meaning energetically available) an channel with imaginary ki to be “closed”. If a channel

the derivative of the wave function:

The quantity N σ

is a factor which serves to connect the normalizations of the two equa-

tions. On the other hand Sij is the scattering matrix of the system (often referred to as

S-matrix), and it represents the probability amplitude to enter the beam splitter in channel

j, and exit it in channel i, or vice versa, since S is Hermitian due to time reversal symmetry.

Moreover, since the equation is true on the whole of the boundary, the channel index

describes the probability amplitude for the atom to be found at either end of the beam

splitter (in fact at any particular arm of the beam splitter), in some particular mode. This

allows us to calculate mode mixing, as well as reﬂection and transmission amplitudes.The

above system of equations can be solved for the unknowns Sij and N σ
j .

F. Solving the Equations: Considerations on Numerical and Mathematical Details

The numerical problem consists of two main parts. The ﬁrst is to ﬁnd the transverse

eigenmodes φi(x, y; z). This is accomplished by solving Eq.(6) at various values of z in such

a way that the adiabatic curves Ui(z) may be interpolated easily. We accomplish this task

by generating a Hamiltonian matrix, again using b-splines as a basis set, and diagonalizing

it at various values of z.

Furthermore one needs to evaluate the P and Q matrices in Eqs.( 10,11). To do this one

may exploit the Hellmann-Feynman theorem to obtain the following expressions: [24]

We adopt a common approximation whereby Qij = 0 for j

= i. The second part consists

of a scattering problem on the adiabatic curves, by choosing a basis set yi(z). For our

calculations we use b-splines.[25, 26]

The guiding potential V (x, y, z) in Fig. 1, exhibits a reﬂection symmetry about the x

y

−

plane. Such a symmetry implies that there is no coupling between even and odd transverse

modes of the beam splitter. This in turn implies that by describing the problem in a basis

of even-odd modes it is possible to solve two smaller problems, signiﬁcantly reducing the

computational eﬀort. At the end of the calculation it is then possible to perform a change of

basis to a “left-right” set describing the “left” and “right” arms of the beamsplitter, where

“right”=“even-odd”, and “left”=“even+odd.”

III. RESULTS

Having described the general formalism, we proceed to report some quantitative results.

In particular, we use the parameters described in the caption of Fig. 1, and study the

behavior of the system as we vary the length L over which the beam is split. We focus

especially on the non adiabatic characteristics of the beamsplitter, namely reﬂection and

higher mode excitation.

The parameters that generate the guiding potential in our model are consistent with those

in recent chip-based experiments [13, 14]. The major diﬀerence is that our model guides

lie close to the substrate, thus tightly conﬁning the atoms in the transverse direction. At

reasonable atom velocities of several cm/sec, only two modes are then energetically open,

simplifying the calculations and interpretation in this pilot study. More realistic beamsplit-

ters can be handled by including the appropriate number of modes in the calculation.

A. The Adiabatic Curves

The simplest level of approximation for the problem is to consider only the ﬁrst even

and odd mode of the structure, and, analogously to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation,

ignore all higher modes and couplings. Within the framework of such an approximation we

see that the Born-Oppenheimer potential depends only on the transverse frequency of the

guide, which is highest at the entrance and exit of the beamsplitter and lowest in the center,

12

6
giving rise to curves resembling smoothed square wells. As it turns out the predictions of

this simple model prove to be grossly inadequate when compared to full coupled channel

calculation. The reason for this is that the Born-Oppenheimer channels are strongly coupled

by nonadiabatic eﬀects.

To suggest how big a correction nonadiabatic eﬀects are, we compare the lowest-lying

Born-Oppenheimer potential U0(R) (dashed line in Fig. 2) to the so-called “adiabatic”
potential, deﬁned by U ef f

(z) = U0(z) + Q00(z) (solid line). The Q00(z) term represents an

0

eﬀect of the transverse momentum on the longitudinal motion. As the guiding potential

varies as a function of z, the paths of the atoms follow the centers of the guides. This

causes the atoms to acquire transverse momentum, which removes kinetic energy from the

longitudinal motion. Thus Q00 is a positive correction.

In chemical physics applications, the adiabatic curve is sometimes, but not always, a

better single-channel representation of the problem [27]. In our case, it usefully incorporates
a primary eﬀect arising from nonadiabaticity. Namely, U ef f

possesses a barrier at the input

0

of the splitter. This barrier reﬂects the fact that kinetic energy spent in transverse motion

halts motion in the longitudinal direction. Eﬀects of this barrier are evident in the fully-

converged scattering calculations, below.

A more complete set of eﬀective adiabatic curves for the ﬁrst few even and odd modes is

shown in Fig.3. For kinetic energies greater than

20µK, excited state potentials are ener-

∼

getically allowed in the scattering region. The corresponding mode mixing can be thought of

as the “sloshing” of the condensate as it is pulled side to side in the potential. Even if these

excited channels are not energetically allowed, they may (and do) still perturb propagation

in the lowest mode. Since the length L of the beamsplitter is, in our model, thousands of

times larger than the longitudinal de Broglie wavelength of the atoms, even a small coupling

between channels can cause a drastic change in phase shift. This implies that we need a

fully coupled channel calculation to solve the problem quantitatively.

Channel coupling is achieved through oﬀ-diagonal elements of the P matrix, several of

which are shown in Fig.4. As expected, the couplings P0i between the lowest channel 0 and

higher channels i diminishes as i gets larger. Also, as implied by Eq.(22) the coupling is

strongest where the potential is steepest in the longitudinal direction (i.e. z =

1 in the

±

ﬁgure).

even and odd modes can be treated separately. The ﬁrst six even and odd modes of the structure

are depicted here.

B. General Features of Scattering

Having deﬁned the terms of the problem, and calculated the adiabatic curves and cou-

plings, we solve the scattering equations and extract the S-matrices of the system. All ﬁgures

shown to this point refer to a beamsplitter with L = 20µm, which is one in which most of the

typical features are present. Fig. 5 shows the absolute values of selected S-matrix elements

for this conﬁguration, which represent the probabilities for various outcomes. In particular

we show the probabilities to exit in the various arm of the beam splitter, assuming unit

input ﬂux from the left arm of the splitter, as deﬁned in Fig. 1. At the incident energies

shown in Fig. 5, only the lowest mode in each arm is energetically accessible. This typical

case is illustrative of the basic elements of the beamsplitter.

In this beamsplitter the largest probabilities (dashed and short-dashed lines in Fig. 5)

correspond to transmission, with the probability alternating between left and right arms.

Thus approximately 50-50 beamsplitting is possible at atom energies where these two curves

cross. Moreover, the sum of the left and right transmission probabilities is almost, but not

quite, equal to unity. This can be seen in the slowly decreasing reﬂection probabilities (solid

and dotted lines) in the ﬁgure. The general features of beamsplitting are preserved under a

convolution in energy, as exhibited in Fig. 5 b). Here and in what follows, convolution is

used to simplify the appearance of the calculations.

The reﬂection probabilities also exhibit a similar left-right oscillation as a function of

energy. In addition, they exhibit a much faster oscillation. This faster oscillation is familiar

from one-dimensional scattering from a potential, with one oscillation being added each time

the energy increases enough to introduce a new de Broglie wavelength into the scattering

region [28]. Here the oscillations are numerous, since the guiding potential is thousands of de

Broglie wavelengths long. (These oscillations are of course also present in the transmission

probabilities, but are too small to be seen on the scale of the ﬁgure.)

For smaller values of L , the beamsplitter is badly non-adiabatic, and even qualitative

features of beamsplitting fade. Fig. 6 shows such a non-adiabatic case, with L = 1µm.

The eﬀect of the input barrier described in Fig. 2, is now much larger, suppressing all

transmission up to input velocities of about 5cm/s. As the kinetic energy reaches the energy

of the barrier, the probability exhibits resonant behavior by the presence of spikes in the S-

matrices. Though mostly washed out by convolution, these features would in principle cause

transparency of the barrier at extremely well deﬁned velocities, where the kinetic energy

equals the energy of a metastable boundstate. At higher atom velocities, above the input

barrier, reﬂection remains extremely likely, and even the basic action of the beamsplitter is

destroyed.

FIG. 6: Scattering probabilities as in Fig. 5, but for the extremely non adiabatic case L = 1µm.

Only the convolved plot is shown, with a width of 26 µK.

C. Towards Adiabaticity

Fig. 7 shows reﬂection probabilities versus atom velocity, for various values of the beam-

splitter lengths L. These results are convolved over an energy width of 16µK, to emphasize

the overall probability rather than the oscillatory structure. For L > 2µm, reﬂection de-

creases nearly linearly on this semi-log plot, suggesting an exponential decrease of reﬂection

probability with velocity. Reﬂection also decreases with increasing L, as expected for an

increasingly adiabatic beamsplitter. The features noticeable around 12.5cm/s and 13.5cm/s

represent cusps at the thresholds for the second and third mode to become energetically

available, smoothed out by convolution.

Finally, in Fig. 8 we plot the total transmission to modes higher than the ﬁrst, for input

velocities higher than the second mode threshold. As might be expected, the probability

to generate higher modes grows as a function of atom velocity. Countering this trend, the

probability again diminishes as the length L becomes longer.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a novel approach to the analysis of non-interacting atomic beams

traveling through waveguides, based on the adiabatic representation of scattering theory.

This method, originally developed for the study of molecular collision theory, is known to

be very ﬂexible, and could be applied to many other guiding geometries. We applied this

approach to the study of a two wire atomic beam-splitter, both to illustrate the method and

to explore a particular guiding geometry. We have found that the nonadiabatic couplings

18

play a signiﬁcant role. Because we have deliberately focused on a tightly-conﬁning geometry,

it is likely that nonadiabaic eﬀects are even more signiﬁcant in realistic beamsplitters. This

will be a topic of future study.

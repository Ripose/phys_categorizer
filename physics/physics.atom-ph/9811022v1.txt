Geometrical Realization of Beutler-Fano formulas appearing in eigenphase shifts and
time delays in multichannel scattering

Dynamic channel couplings in the system of one discrete state and two continua in the neigh-
borhood of an isolated resonance are geometrically visualized. Dynamical parameters describing
channel couplings boil down to three angles and three phase shifts which form three arc and ver-
tex angles of a spherical triangle. Interestingly, the cotangent laws of the spherical triangle yield
Beutler-Fano (or Fano) resonance formulas appearing in eigenphase shifts and time delays. Since
the spherical triangle contains parameters of both scattering and time delay matrices, the com-
plete understanding of channel couplings in multichannel scattering can not be attained without
simultaneous consideration of both matrices.

Recently, we have witnessed a lot of research activities in time delays in various ﬁelds. Chemists have used them as a
convenient computational tool for treating resonant scattering processes [1]. The study of them in the tunneling process
has attracted a lot of attention [2]. Besides these activities, there have been individual ones in them and eigenphase
shifts associated with them [3]. The latter have been used in various places and are, in particular, indispensable
dynamical parameters in the multichannel quantum defect theory [4]. Recently, for the system of one discrete state
and two continua in the neighborhood of an isolated resonance, we identiﬁed new parameters that describe channel
couplings in eigenphase shifts and time delays [5]. Here we report that such dynamical channel couplings can be
visualized geometrically. In particular, the Beutler-Fano (or simply Fano) resonance formulas obtained in Ref. [5] will
be shown to be derived from the cotangent laws of a spherical triangle. Similar geometrical constructions may be
attempted to deepen our understanding of dynamics in Fano resonances occurring in diﬀerent areas and ﬁelds.

Resonance phenomena in multichannel scattering processes are aﬀected not only by the interactions between a
quasi-bound state and continua but also by the indirect interactions between continua via the quasi-bound state. Let
the S matrix for a multichannel scattering process be described by the eigenphase shifts δi (i = 1, 2, ...) deﬁned as
S = U e−2iδ ˜U in the processes along eigenchannels which are the eigenvectors of the S matrix. In U e−2iδ ˜U, the tilde
denotes transpose and negative phase shifts mean that we are considering an incoming wave boundary condition [5].
The indirect interaction between continua causes the curves of eigenphase shifts avoided as they approach closely
as energy varies. In Ref. [5], the system of one discrete state and two continua in the neighborhood of an isolated
resonance was examined as a prototypical system for the study of the combined eﬀects of the resonance and avoided
crossing interactions. Using Fano’s conﬁguration interaction theory [6], where the system is described by ﬁve dynamical
parameters, namely the resonance energy Er, partial decay widths Γ1 and Γ2 of a resonance state into background
eigenchannels 1 and 2, and background eigenphase shifts δ0

the eigenvectors of the background scattering matrix, the avoided crossing interaction matrix, and the time delay

identiﬁed with the cotangent laws of the spherical triangle. The same is true with the Beutler-Fano formula for the
cotangent of the angle describing the relative contribution of the time delays due to the frame change to the one due
to the avoided crossing interaction. Similar geometrical constructions may be attempted to deepen our understanding
of dynamics in Fano resonances occurring in diﬀerent areas and ﬁelds.

Abstract. Energies and transition probabilities of Kβ hypersatellite lines are
computed using the Dirac-Fock model for several values of Z throughout the periodic
table. The inﬂuence of the Breit interaction on the energy shifts from the corresponding
diagram lines and on the Kβh
3 intensity ratio is evaluated. The widths of the
double-K hole levels are calculated for Al and Sc. The results are compared to
experiment and to other theoretical calculations.

1. Introduction

Energies and transition probabilities of Kβ hypersatellite lines are evaluated in this work
for selected atoms throughout the periodic table. In a previous paper [1], we reported
on calculated values of Kα hypersatellite line energies for atoms with 12 ≤ Z ≤ 30.

A hypersatellite line is an X-ray line for which the initial state has two vacancies
in the same shell. This is the case, for example, when a double ionized K-shell state
decays through the transition of one M-shell electron. Lines corresponding to 1s−2 →
1s−13p−1 transitions, where nℓ−k means k vacancies in the nℓ subshell, are called Kβh
1,3
hypersatellite lines.

Atoms where a whole inner shell is empty while the outer shells are occupied were
ﬁrst named hollow atoms by Briand et al
[2] and are of great importance for studies
of ultrafast dynamics in atoms far from equilibrium and with possible wide-ranging
applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science [3].

Very scarce experimental data exist on energies of K hypersatellite lines, due to
the low probability of creation of the initial two K holes. Briand et al
[4] used a
coincidence method to study the K hypersatellite spectrum in Ga and measured a 390
eV energy shift for the Kβh lines relative to the corresponding diagram lines. Energies
of Kβh hypersatellite lines were later measured by Briand et al
[5, 6] for Mn, Ga and
1,3 and Kαh hypersatellite spectra
In. Diamant et al
of Fe, using monochromatized synchrotron radiation photoexcitation. Similar work has
been performed for Cr Kβh hypersatellite spectra [8]. More recently, this work has been
extended to Ti

[7] obtained high resolution Kβh

[9].

On the theoretical side, calculations of the energies and transition probabilities
of Kβh
1,3 hypersatellite lines have been performed [10] using a Dirac-Hartree-Slater
approach. This approach employs a local approximation to the atomic potential. With
the wave functions obtained from this potential, perturbation calculations were then
used to obtain the energies. Diamant et al
[7] performed relativistic multi-conﬁguration
Dirac-Fock calculations for the Kβh
1,3 hypersatellite lines of Fe to compare with their own
experimental ﬁndings.

The energy shifts between the Kβh

1,3 hypersatellite lines and the corresponding Kβ1,3
diagram lines (as the Kαh-Kα ones) are considered to be very sensitive to the Breit
interaction. Chen et al
[10] calculated the inﬂuence of the Breit interaction on these
shifts, using a mathematical form appropriate for the local approximation employed.
To check the importance of the Breit interaction, values of these shifts as well of the
Kβh
3 intensity ratios were calculated in this work for selected values of Z, with and
without inclusion of the this interaction.

Using the results of our calculations, we were able to obtain the widths of the 1s−2

two-hole levels of Al and Sc.

2. Calculation of atomic wave functions and energies

Bound state wave functions and radiative transition probabilities were calculated
using the multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock program of J. P. Desclaux and P. Indelicato
[11, 12, 13]. The program was used in single-conﬁguration mode because correlation
was found to be unimportant for the energies and probabilities transition. The wave
functions of the initial and ﬁnal states were computed independently, that is, atomic
orbitals were fully relaxed in the calculation of the wave function for each state, and
non-orthogonality was taken in account in transition probability calculations.

In order to obtain a correct relationship between many-body methods and quantum
electrodynamics (QED) [14, 15, 16, 17], one should start from the no-pair Hamiltonian

Hno pair =

HD(ri) +

V(rij),

Xi<j

N

Xi=1

where rij = |ri − rj|, and HD is the one electron Dirac operator and V is an operator
representing the electron-electron interaction of order one in α, properly set up between
projection operators Λ++
j to avoid coupling positive and negative energy states

ij = Λ+

i Λ+
ij V (rij)Λ++
ij

.

V(rij) = Λ++

In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the interaction between charged particles is
described by an operator associated to the potential energy of interaction, V (rij),
which is only a function of the distance between particles, rij. However, in quantum
electrodynamics there exists no potential energy of interaction that depends on the
coordinates of the interacting charged particles taken at the same time, since the charges
interact not directly, but via the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The operator for the interaction
potential energy is replaced, in the ﬁrst approximation, by the scattering matrix [18]

After performing the time integration of (3), one ﬁnds the following well known

interaction potential, in Coulomb gauge and in atomic units,

where is ωij is the energy of the photon exchanged between the two electrons, αi are
the Dirac matrices and c = 1/α is the speed of light. The ﬁrst term (4a) represents
the Coulomb interaction, the second one (4b) is the Gaunt interaction (magnetic
interaction), and the last two terms (4c) stand for the retardation operator.
In this

expression the ∇ operators act only on rij and not on the following wave functions. By
a series expansion of the terms Eqs. (4b)-(4c) in powers of ωijrij/c ≪ 1 one obtains the
Breit interaction, which includes the leading retardation contribution of order 1/c2. The
Breit interaction is the sum of the Gaunt interaction (4b) and of the Breit retardation

In the present calculation the electron-electron interaction is described by the sum of
the Coulomb and the Breit interaction. Higher orders in 1/c, coming from the diﬀerence
between Eqs. (4c) and (5) are treated here only as a ﬁrst order perturbation.

We use the Coulomb gauge as it has been demonstrated that it provides energies
free from spurious contributions at the ladder approximation level and must be used in
many-body atomic structure calculations [19].

Finally, from a full QED treatment, one also obtains the radiative corrections
(important for the innermost shells) to the electron-nucleus interaction (self-energy and
vacuum polarization). The one-electron self-energy is evaluated using the one-electron
values of Mohr and coworkers [20, 21, 22]. The self-energy screening is treated with the
Welton method developed in Refs. [23, 24, 25, 26]. This method yields results in close
agreement (better than 5%) with ab initio methods based on QED [27, 28, 29, 30],
without the huge amount of eﬀort involved.

The vacuum polarization is evaluated as described in Ref. [31]. The Uelhing
contribution is evaluated to all orders by being included in the self-consistent ﬁeld
(SCF). The Wichmann and Kroll, and K¨all´en and Sabry contributions are included
perturbatively. These three contributions are evaluated using the numerical procedure
from Refs. [32, 33].

3. Results

3.1. Introduction

We calculated the energy shifts of the Kβh
13 hypersatellite lines relative to the
corresponding diagram lines for several atoms with 13 ≤ Z ≤ 80, and the Kβh
1 and
Kβh
3 energy shifts, and their relative intensities, for selected atoms with 18 ≤ Z ≤ 80.
The wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal states were computed independently, that is,
atomic orbitals were fully relaxed in the calculation of the wave function for each state.
1,3 hypersatellite lines some

In what concerns the precise identiﬁcation of the Kβh

comments are in order.

Depending on the conﬁgurations of the initial and ﬁnal states, for the diﬀerent
values of Z, the number of transition lines that must be computed may range from only
two, when the initial state has only closed shells, to several thousand, when unﬁlled
shells exist.

For elements with ﬁlled shells, namely Ar, Ca, Zn, Kr, Sr, Pd, Cd, Xe, Ba and Hg
the 1s−2 ground conﬁguration corresponds to only one level, the 1S0 level, and each of

Relativistic calculation of Kβ hypersatellite transitions

the Kβh lines is identiﬁed by a precise level transition,

1s−2 1S0 → 1s−13p−1 3P1.

By analogy with the corresponding diagram lines, the line that corresponds to the

larger transition energy value is labeled Kβh

1 and the other one is labeled Kβh
3 .

For Z ≥ 29 there are two sets of transition lines, separated in energy by more than
3 eV, corresponding to the Kβh
3 lines. In the ﬁrst set the decay is due mainly
to the 3p3/2 electron transition, whereas in the second set is mainly due to the 3p1/2
electron transition. LS coupling dominates the level structure for elements with Z < 29,
as can be seen in Fig. 1 for Si. In this ﬁgure, the labels refer to the only transitions that
contribute for the spectrum. Intercombination lines give negligible contribution.

The transition probability W X for the line X is deﬁned as
i N (i) W X

W X =

where γ is, in this case, a given double-K hole conﬁguration, N (i) is a collection of
excited atoms per unit volume and N (γ) =

P
for the line X from an initial level i, deﬁned by

i N(i). W X
i

W X

i =

Wif ,

Xf X

where f X runs over all possible ﬁnal levels in the radiative de-excitation process leading
to the X line, and Wif is the probability per unit time that an atom in the excited level
i, will decay to the level f , through the spontaneous emission of a photon.

For short lifetimes τ of the excited levels, compared with characteristic creating
times (the inverse of the number of excitations per second undergone by one atom),
the number of atoms doubly ionized in the K shell created in the excited level i per
unit time Cγ (i) equals the rate at which the atoms leave the level i, N (i) /τ (i), by all
possible transitions. Assuming that the i level of a given double-K hole γ conﬁguration
is fed according their statistical weight, we have

Cγ (i) = Cγ

g (i)
g (γ)

,

where g (i) and g (γ) are the multiplicities of the i level and of the γ double-K hole
conﬁguration, respectively, and Cγ is the number of double-K ionised atoms created per
unit time and per unit volume. From Eq. (6) and (8) we obtain

where f runs for all possible ﬁnal levels that can be reached by radiative transitions,

For the elements where the two K-hole ground conﬁguration has more than one
level, it is therefore necessary to compute, for each of those levels, not only radiative
transition probabilities, but also the radiationless (Auger) transition probabilities, to
obtain the quantities W X.

A complete calculation of radiative and radiationless decay rates from the double-K
hole ground conﬁguration was performed for Al and Sc. Radiative transitions include
Kαh and Kβh hypersatellite lines, as well as Kαα (one electron - two photon transitions)
1 together with the total radiative and
lines. The results are presented in Table
radiationless transition probabilities, for each of the two initial levels.

In Table 2 we provide the results of the complete calculation of W X for the diﬀerent
lines in Al and Sc and of the statistical average transition probability of line X, deﬁned
as the quantity

(12)

W X

SA =

g (i) W X

g (γ) Xi
We observe that the values of W X and W X

SA are nearly identical. This results from
the fact that Eq. (12) can be obtained from Eq. (11) if the summation Wi + Ai has the
same value for all initial levels. This is the case of Al and Sc presented in Table 1.

Total radiationless level widths are the sums of a large number of transition rates.
We may assume that the relativistic eﬀects tend to average out to some extent, similarly
to what happens with total radiative widths [34]. To test this assumption, the value
of radiationless (Auger) decay rate for each initial level of the Ti 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2
4s2 ground conﬁguration was computed by adding the values of radiationless transition
probabilities for all levels of the ﬁnal 1s 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2 conﬁguration. As shown
in Table 3, no signiﬁcant variation of the decay rates was found for diﬀerent initial
levels, which shows that the radiationless decay rates do not depend signiﬁcantly on the
particular level of the initial conﬁguration. This validates the use of Eq. (12) as a good
value to W X.

The ratio of the intensities of Kβh

1 to Kβh
3 hypersatellite lines computed in this
work, with and without the Breit interaction, using the MCDF code of Desclaux and
Indelicato, are presented in Table 4, together with the values obtained by Chen et al
, which included Breit and vacuum-polarization corrections. We notice that our values
for these ratios are larger than Chen’s results for Z ≤ 40. The two approaches yield
ratios that are in good agreement for Z > 40.

Relativistic calculation of Kβ hypersatellite transitions

In order to compare the transition energy values obtained in this work with
experiment and calculations from other authors, we used the statistical average energy

In this calculation we assumed that all i levels of the γ conﬁguration are statistically
populated. The quantity in parenthesis is the average energy of the X line, deﬁned as
the sum of the energies of all individual i → f transitions in the X line from an initial
level i, Eif , weighted by the corresponding Wif

radiative transition probability.

3.3. Widths of 1s−2 levels of Al and Sc

Using the values presented in Table 1, we were able to calculate the widths of the 1s−2
levels of Al and Sc, which are displayed in Table 5.

We believe this is the ﬁrst time that level widths are calculated for a double-K hole
level. These values can be compared with existing single-K hole level widths, using the

the value calculated in this work. We note, however, that the experimental values of
for Al referred to by the same authors are higher than their proposed value.

Three of these values were derived from indirect measurements, using other level widths
to obtain the 1s−1 level width. The only experiment that led directly to the 1s−1 level

3.4. Energy shifts

In Table 6 we present the results obtained in this work for the Kβh
shifts of the elements where we can distinguish these two lines.

This Table shows that our results for the Kβh hypersatellites energy shifts, relative
to the corresponding diagram line energies, are in good agreement with the results of
Chen et al

[10], ours being smaller by less than 0.2 % throughout.

To compare to the available experimental results, we present in Table 7 the Kβh
1,3
energy shifts calculated in this work. Our results agree in general with experiment, as
it can be seen in Fig. 2, although the uncertainties of the latter are very large, with the
exception of the recent experimental value of Diamant et al

[7].

3.5. Breit interaction and QED corrections

To assess the contribution of the Breit interaction to the Kβh hypersatellites energy
shifts, we computed these shifts with and without inclusion of the Breit interaction
in the calculation. We computed separately the Kβh
1 energy shifts, ﬁrst with the Breit
term (cf. Eq. (5)) included in the self-consistent process and the higher-order terms as a
perturbation after the self-consistent process is ﬁnished, and then with Breit interaction
neglected. The results are presented in Table 8. Although Chen et al
[10] present
their results for these shifts, obtained with the Dirac-Slater approach, in graphic form
only, we easily conclude that our results, using the MCDF approach, are in very good
agreement with the results of Chen et al .

The Kβh

1 to Kβh

[10] ﬁnding for the Kαh

3 intensity ratio is sensitive to the inclusion of the Breit interaction,
1 to Kαh
similarly to Chem et al
2 intensity ratio. The inclusion
of this interaction decreases the Kβh intensity ratio at low Z (21% for Z = 18) and
increases it for medium and high Z (∼ 5% at Z ≃ 50). However, since relativity aﬀects
the 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 levels in a similar way the Kβh intensity ratio increases monotonically
towards the jj coupling limit of 2.

The evolution of the relative contribution of Breit interaction to the Kβh

1 /Kβh
3

relative intensity ratio is illustrated in Fig. 3.

On the other hand, QED contributions for the energy shifts and transition
probabilities have been found to be negligible. For instance, QED contributions for
the Kβh
1 − Kβ1 energy shift in Hg is only 0.3% compared with 13% from the Breit
interaction contribution, whereas for the Kβh
1 /Kβh
3 intensity ratio the QED contribution
is 0.05%, compared with 1.8% from the Breit contribution. The QED contributions for
the Kβh

1 − Kβ1 energy shift are presented in Table 8.

4. Conclusion

1 and Kβh

In this work we used the MCDF program of Desclaux and Indelicato to compute energy
shifts of the Kβh
3 hypersatellite lines relative to the parent diagram lines for
several values of Z throughout the periodic table. One of the aims of this work was to
assess the contribution of the Breit interaction to these shifts. Our results conﬁrm the
earlier ﬁndings of Chen et al
[10] for these shifts and extended them to higher values
of Z. We also calculated the Kβh
3 intensity ratio for the same values of Z. Our
results are signiﬁcantly lower than Chen et al values for the same ratios, for Z lower
than 40, and agree with the values of these authors for higher values of Z. The total
widths of the double-hole K levels of Al and Sc were also computed and our values were
found in good agreement with the ones obtained from proposed values of single-K hole
levels [35].

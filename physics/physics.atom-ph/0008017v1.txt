The collisional stability of ultracold polar molecules in
electrostatic traps is considered. Rate constants for collisions
that drive molecules from weak-ﬁeld-seeking to strong-ﬁeld-
seeking states are estimated using a simple model. The rates
are found to be quite large, of order 10−12-10−10 cm3/sec,
and moreover to grow rapidly in an externally applied elec-
tric ﬁeld. It is argued that these results are generic for po-
lar molecules, and that therefore polar molecules should be
trapped by other than electrostatic means.

Recently Bethlem et al. broadened the scope of ultra-
cold AMO physics by cooling and electrostatically trap-
ping ND3 molecules [1,2]. This achievement is notable
both for the complexity of the species trapped and for
the generality of the Stark slowing technique, which could
in principle cool any polar molecule. This technique is
therefore now on a par with other experimental methods
for producing cold molecular gases, such as photoassoci-
ation [3] and buﬀer-gas cooling [4], as well as photopro-
duction of molecular ions in a Paul trap [5].

The electrostatic trap demonstrated in Ref. [2] raises
anew questions of collisional stability that are familiar in
the context of magnetic trapping of atoms [6]. An elec-
trostatic trap can only conﬁne dipoles that are in their
weak-ﬁeld seeking states, since Maxwell’s equations per-
mit a local ﬁeld minimum but not a ﬁeld maximum. Thus
the dipoles are succeptible to orientation-changing colli-
sions that populate the strong-ﬁeld seeking, untrapped
states. In the case of magnetic trapping of alkali atoms
a standard remedy against collisional losses is to pre-
pare the atoms in their stretched spin states, whereby
the dominant spin-exchange collisional processes are ab-
sent. Atomic spins can then only change their orientation
via spin-spin dipolar processes, which are weak because
of the inherent weakness of magnetic dipolar interactions.
The purpose of this Rapid Communication is to point
out that polar molecules are not as immune to dipolar re-
laxation as are magnetic atoms, simply because electric
dipoles have a much stronger interaction.
Indeed, the
force between a pair of d = 1 Debye (0.39 atomic units)
electric dipoles is ∼ 3×103 times larger than that between
a pair of µ = 1µB magnetic dipoles. The basic physics
of electric dipolar relaxation lies in the competition be-
tween the dipoles’ interaction with the electric ﬁeld when
they are far apart, − ~d · ~E, and with each other when they
are closer together, ∼ ~d1 · ~d2/R3. At small values of in-
termolecular separation R the dipoles will tend to lock

on their intermolecular axis rather than on the lab-ﬁxed
axis set by ~E; the competition between these tendencies
scrambles the orientation of the molecular dipoles. The
resulting state-changing collisions can in principle be sup-
pressed by a ﬁeld strong enough to maintain the dipolar
orientation. This will happen, roughly, if dE > d2/R3
for small values of R. Still, for d = 1 Debye dipoles at
a typical collision distance R ≈ 10 atomic units (a.u.),
an electric ﬁeld of 106 V/cm would be required to main-
tain dipolar orientation. Thus very large laboratory ﬁelds
may exert some mitigating inﬂuence, but are unlikely to
arrest relaxation altogether.

To quantify this general argument this paper presents
detailed calculations using a simpliﬁed model of colli-
sions.
In general the physics of cold molecular colli-
sions will be quite complex, intertwining rotational, elec-
tronic, nuclear spin, and perhaps even vibrational de-
grees of freedom. However, to establish orders of magni-
tude for dipolar relaxation rate constants it suﬃces to
focus on orientational degrees of freedom, and to ac-
count only for the dominant dipole-dipole interaction be-
tween molecules. Accordingly, a simpliﬁed “toy” model
is used here, which has zero spin and nuclear spin. The
molecules are assumed to be diatomic rigid rotors with
electric dipole moments d = 1 Debye along their molec-
ular axes. The electronic ground state of the molecules
is assumed to be 1Π, so that it possesses a Λ-doublet of
parity eigenstates. The splitting of this doublet is as-
sumed to have a “typical” value of ∆ = 10−3 cm−1, and
the lower-energy state is assumed to have even parity.

At ultracold temperatures and in zero electric ﬁeld
the molecules occupy parity eigenstates, hence exhibit
no permanent dipole moment. The dipole moments only
become apparent when the ﬁeld is large enough to sig-
niﬁcantly mix states of diﬀerent parity, thus “activat-
ing” the dipoles. This occurs at a ﬁeld value where the
Stark eﬀect transforms from quadratic to linear, at ≈ 100
V/cm in the present model (Figure 1). For ﬁelds below
this value the molecules are fairly weakly interacting,
whereas above this value the molecules have extremely
strong dipole couplings. Thus in the Λ-doubled state col-
lisions can be manipulated using modest electric ﬁelds,
in contrast to the ∼ 105 V/cm ﬁelds required to inﬂuence
cold atomic collisions [7]. These arguments also apply to
molecules with 2S+1Σ electronic symmetry when S > 0
and the molecule exhibits an Ω-doubling [8], as well as
to ND3.

Figure 1 shows the electric ﬁeld dependence of the
lowest-lying energy levels in the model molecules. Al-
though both N = 1 and N = 2 rotational levels are

1

shown, the calculations below focus exclusively on the
N = 1 levels. Their low-E behavior is shown in the inset,
labeled by the pair of quantum numbers |MN |, p. Here p
stands for the parity in zero ﬁeld, while |MN | denotes the
magnitude of the molecular rotation’s magnetic quantum
number referred to the laboratory axis; the MN = 1 and
MN = −1 levels are degenerate even in an electric ﬁeld.
In an electrostatic trap of the kind used by Bethlem et al.
the trapped states are the weak-ﬁeld seekers, i.e., those
whose Stark energy rises with rising ﬁeld. These are the
||MN |, pi = |1, −i states in the model.

The Hamiltonian for collisions between the molecules

consists of four terms in this model,

ˆH = ˆT + ˆHfs + ˆHﬁeld + ˆHdip−dip.

(1)

Here ˆT represents the kinetic energy, ˆHfs the molecular
ﬁne structure including the Λ-doubling, and the last two
terms are the electric ﬁeld interaction and the dipole-
dipole interaction between molecules:

ˆHﬁeld = −(~d1 + ~d2) · ~E,

ˆHdip−dip =

~d1 · ~d2 − 3( ˆR · ~d1)( ˆR · ~d2)

R3

,

(2)

(3)

where ˆR denotes the orientation of the vector joining
the centers-of-mass of the molecules. Dispersion and ex-
change potentials are neglected here since they are of sec-
ondary importance to dipolar interactions at large R. To
avoid problems with the singularity of 1/R3 at R = 0,
vanishing boundary conditions are imposed at a cutoﬀ
radius R0 = 10 a.u., where the potentials are deep com-
pared to ∆.

In the scattering calculation the molecules are assumed
to be identical bosons, so that only even partial waves are
relevant. Only the partial waves L = 0 and L = 2 are
included explicitly, even though in principle all partial
waves are coupled together by strong anisotropic interac-
tions. However, the neglected higher-L partial waves can
be shown, in the Born approximation, to fall oﬀ rapidly
with L [9,10]. Cross sections for processes that change
molecular channel |ii into channel |i′i are given as in Ref.
[11]:

where T is the T-matrix for scattering and ki is the inci-
dent wave number. Because of the incoherent sum in (4),
contributions arising from L = 0 and L = 2 incident par-
tial waves can be presented individually. All results, for
both elastic and state-changing collisions will be reported
as event rate coeﬃcients,

Ki→i′ = viσi→i′ ,

(5)

where vi is the incident relative velocity of the collision
partners.

Although state-changing collisions are primarily of in-
terest here, it is useful ﬁrst to consider elastic scattering
of polar molecules, to illustrate the enormous inﬂuence
of the electric ﬁeld. Figure 2 shows the elastic scat-
tering rate constant Kel for molecules in their |MN , pi
= |1, −i state. Figure 2(a) depicts the low-ﬁeld limit
(E = 0 V/cm), while Fig. 2(b) shows a higher-ﬁeld limit
(E = 200 V/cm), where the Stark eﬀect is linear. These
rate constants are separated into their s-wave (solid line)
and d-wave (dashed line) contributions.

In both the low- and high-ﬁeld regimes the s-wave rate
has the familiar Kel ∝ E1/2 threshold behavior as a func-
tion of collision energy E, arising from the Wigner thresh-
old law. For the d-waves, however, the threshold depen-
dence changes dramatically, falling oﬀ as Kel ∝ E5/2 at
low ﬁeld but as Kel ∝ E1/2 at higher ﬁelds. This be-
havior has to do with qualitative diﬀerences in the long-
range intermolecular potentials.
In the low-ﬁeld limit,
the asymptotic molecular states are parity eigenstates,
hence have no dipole moment. At large values of R,
where the dipole-dipole interaction energy becomes less
than the Λ-doubling energy, the dipole-dipole 1/R3 po-
tential is thus eﬀectively absent. By contrast, in the high-
ﬁeld regime parity eigenstates are mixed at large R and
the 1/R3 potential is activated. It is well known [12,13]
that a 1/R3 potential contributes a long-range scattering
phase shift that is proportional to the wave number k
for all partial waves L > 0, thus yielding a Kel ∝ E1/2
threshold law.

This “switching on” of the dipolar interaction in the
presence of a ﬁeld also manifests itself in the inelastic rate
constants, which are shown in Figure 3. This ﬁgure shows
the sum Krelax = Pi′ Ki→i′ of all the rate constants for
collisions of |MN , pi = |+1, −i molecules in which at least
one molecule relaxes into one of the strong-ﬁeld-seeking
states ||MN |, pi = |0, −i, |0, +i, or |1, +i (see Fig. 1).
Again both the E = 0 V/cm and E = 200 V/cm cases
are shown, and the rates are separated into L = 0 and
L = 2 initial states. These relaxation rates are domi-
nated by exothermic processes which exhibit their own
characteristic threshold behavior. The rates for L = 0
partial waves become independent of energy at thresh-
old, while the behavior of L = 2 partial waves transforms
from the usual Wigner result Krelax ∝ E2 at low ﬁeld, to
a Krelax ∝ E behavior at high ﬁeld when the dipoles are
activated [14].

More signiﬁcantly, the values of the loss rate constant
are substantially boosted by the presence of an electric
ﬁeld, even for s-wave collisions. This is simply because
the strong dipolar interactions that drive inelastic tran-
sitions are also made stronger in an electric ﬁeld. Figure
4 shows the threshold relaxation rate as a function of
electric ﬁeld. Even at low ﬁeld the rates are fairly large,
since dipole interactions are still present at small R. As
the ﬁeld grows to E ∼ 100 V/cm, where the dipoles turn
on, the rates rise sharply. In the particular model con-
sidered here the rates are boosted nearly two orders of
magnitude by the ﬁeld.

Weak-electric-ﬁeld seeking states should quite gener-
ally suﬀer these large loss rates. Quantum mechanically
this follows from the fact that the large-R Hamiltonian
ˆHfs + ˆHﬁeld is diagonal in the laboratory frame, while the
interaction Hamiltonian ˆHdip−dip is diagonal in the body
frame that joins the centers-of-mass of the two molecules.
The former is stronger at large separations R, while the
latter dominates at small R. Molecules that start out in
eigenstates of ˆHfs + ˆHﬁeld are thus distributed over all the
diﬀerent states of ˆHdip−dip during the collision, and re-
assembled into an assortment of eigenstates of ˆHfs+ ˆHﬁeld
as the molecules separate. Since the asymptotic states
are completely deconstructed and reconstructed during
this collision, in general it is expected that the probabil-
ity for inelastic scattering is roughly the same as that for
elastic scattering, and that therefore the rates are com-
parable.

In conclusion, dipolar molecules

This is of course the same kind of physics that gov-
erns spin-exchange collisions in the alkali atoms, which
are driven by the competition between hyperﬁne-plus-
magnetic ﬁeld interactions at large R, and exchange po-
tentials at small R [15]. In the case of alkali atoms it is
possible that the short-range phase shifts, from singlet
and triplet total electronic spin states, can interfere in
such a way as to eliminate probabilities for inelastic pro-
cesses [16]. For molecules this coincidence seems unlikely,
however, since there are are many degrees of freedom at
short range, all of which would have to contribute nearly
identical scattering phase shifts in order cancel loss rates.
electrostatically
trapped in weak-ﬁeld-seeking states are succeptible to
state-changing collisions that can rapidly deplete the
trapped gas. Moreover, these rates can grow in the pres-
ence of the trapping electric ﬁeld, which eﬀectively turns
on the full dipolar coupling at large intermolecular sepa-
ration. Although this conclusion has been demonstrated
using a particular toy model, the physics is quite gen-
eral and should apply to any polar species. It is there-
fore recommended that dipolar molecules be trapped in
strong-ﬁeld-seeking states, where inelastic channels are
absent at low temperatures. This kind of trapping cannot
be achieved in a static trap, but would require a time-
varying electric ﬁeld. Magnetic dipoles in strong-ﬁeld
seeking states have indeed been conﬁned in such traps,
using either time-varying ﬁelds [17] or microwave cavi-
ties [18]. A more conventional magnetic trap may also
be useful, although the inﬂuence of the electric dipoles
on losses in magnetic traps would have to be explored.

More broadly, an externally applied electric ﬁeld is seen
to have a profound inﬂuence on the collision dynamics of
ultracold polar molecules, even to the extent of altering
the threshold behavior. Preliminary results on the prop-
erties of quantum degenerate gases with dipolar inter-
actions have been reported in the literature [9,19]. More
detailed scattering calculations are required to help shape
the study of these unusual substances [10].

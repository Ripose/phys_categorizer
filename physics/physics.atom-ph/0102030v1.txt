Abstract

Van der Waals coeﬃcients for the heteronuclear alkali-metal dimers of Li,
Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr are calculated using relativistic ab initio methods aug-
mented by high-precision experimental data. We argue that the uncertainties
in the coeﬃcients are unlikely to exceed about 1%.

Considerable attention has been given to the determination of the coeﬃcients of the
leading term of the van der Waals attractions of two alkali metal atoms because of their
importance in the simulation, prediction, and interpretation of experiments on cold atom
collisions, photoassociation and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [1–6]. There is strong interest in
heteronuclear molecules formed by pairs of diﬀerent alkali metal atoms. Experiments have
been carried out on trap loss in mixtures of Na with K [7,8], Rb [9,10], and Cs [11] and on
optical collisions [12] in a Na-Cs mixture and on molecular formation [13]. The mixtures
of magnetically-trapped alkali metal atoms Na-Cs and Na-K have been proposed [14] as a
means to search for evidence of an electric dipole moment to test for violation of parity
and time reversal symmetry. We extend here previous studies [15] of the van der Waals
coeﬃcient between pairs of identical ground state alkali metal atoms to unlike ground state
atoms.

Modern all-order many-body methods are capable of predicting electric-dipole matrix
elements for principal transitions and energies in alkali-metals to within errors approaching
0.1% [18]. Many-body methods augmented by high-precision experimental data for principal
transitions, similar to those employed in PNC calculations [19], have led to a high-precision
evaluation of dynamic dipole polarizabilities for alkali-metal atoms [15]. The values of C6
previously calculated for homonuclear dimers [15] are in excellent agreement with analyses
of cold-atom scattering of Na [20], Rb [2], and Cs [6,21]. Here we employ the same methods
to compute the van der Waals coeﬃcients for heteronuclear alkali-metal dimers.

Precise nonrelativistic variational calculations of C6 for Li2 have been carried out [22].
They provide a critical test of our procedures. We separate the dynamic polarizability
into valence and core contributions, which correspond respectively to valence-electron and
core-electron excited intermediate states in the sum, Eq. (4). In our calculations for Li we
employ high-precision experimental values for the principal transition 2s
2pJ , all-order
many-body data and experimental energies for 3pJ and 4pJ intermediate states, and Dirac-
Hartree-Fock values for higher valence-electron excitations. The high-precision all-order
calculations were performed using the relativistic linearized coupled-cluster method trun-
cated at single and double excitations from a reference determinant [18,23]. Contributions
of valence-excited states above 4pJ were obtained by a direct summation over a relativistic
B-spline basis set [24] obtained in the “frozen-core” (V N −1) Dirac-Hartree-Fock potential.
Core excitations were treated with a highly-accurate relativistic conﬁguration-interaction
method applied to the two-electron Li+ ion. For the heavier alkali-metals [15] the random-
phase approximation [25] was used to calculate this contribution.

The principal transition 2s

2pJ accounts for 99% of the static polarizability and 96%
of the Li2 dispersion coeﬃcient. In accurate experiments McAlexander et al. [26] reported
a lifetime of the 2p state of 27.102(9) ns (an accuracy of 0.03%) and Martin et al. [27]
reported 27.13(2) ns. In our calculations we employ the more precise value from Ref. [26]; in
the subsequent error analysis we arbitrarily assigned an error bar of twice the quoted value
of Ref. [26], so that the two experiments are consistent.

The dynamic core polarizability of Li was obtained in the framework of the relativistic
conﬁguration-interaction (CI) method for helium-like systems. This CI setup is described
by Johnson and Cheng [28], who used it to calculate precise relativistic static dipole po-
larizabilities. We extended their method to calculate the dynamic polarizability α(iω) for
two-electron systems. The numerical accuracy was monitored by comparison with results of
Ref. [28] for the static polarizability of Li+ and with the sum rule, Eq. (5), in the limit of
large frequencies. Core-excited states contribute only 0.5% to C6 and 0.1% to α(0) for Li.
Their contribution becomes much larger for heavier alkali metals.

We calculated static and dynamic polarizabilities and used quadrature, Eq. (3), to obtain
the dispersion coeﬃcient. The results are C6 = 1390 and α(0) = 164.0. There are two major
sources of uncertainties in the ﬁnal value of C6 — experimental error in the dipole matrix
elements of the principal transition, and theoretical error related to higher valence-electron
excitations. The former results in a uncertainty of 0.12%, and the latter much less. The
result C6 = 1390(2) is in good agreement with the nonrelativistic variational result of Yan
et al. [22], C6 = 1393.39. The slight discrepancy between the two values may arise because
in our formulation, the correlations of core-excited states with the valence electron were
disregarded as were intermediate states containing simultaneous excitation of the valence

3

electron with one or both core electrons. On the other hand, Ref. [22] did not account for
relativistic corrections. Relativistic contractions lead to a smaller value of C6 and to better
agreement between the present result and that of Ref. [22]. Similar error analysis for the
static polarizability of Li leads to α(0) = 164.0(1), which agrees with the numerically precise
nonrelativistic result of 164.111 [22]. An extensive comparison with other published data for
the values of α(0) and C6 for lithium is given in Ref. [22]. For the heavier alkali metal atoms
we followed the procedures of Ref. [15] to calculate α(iω). The results for Cs are illustrated
in Fig. 1. They indicate that while most of the contribution to C6 comes from the resonant
transition at ω

0.05 a.u. the core excitations are signiﬁcant.

Results and Conclusions—We evaluated the dispersion coeﬃcients for various heteronu-
clear alkali-metal dimers with the quadrature Eq. (3). The calculated values are presented in
Table I. Most of the contributions to C AB
come from the principal transitions of each atom.
An analysis of the dispersion coeﬃcient of unlike atoms yields the approximate formula

where the energy separations of the principal transitions are designated as ∆EA and ∆EB.
Eq. (6) combined with the high-accuracy values of C6 for homonuclear dimers [15] gives
accurate approximations to our results based on Eq. (3). For example, Eq. (6) overestimates
our accurate value from Table I for Li-Na by 0.4% and for Cs-Li by 2%. We may use Eq. (6)
in the heteronuclear cases from the uncertainties δC AA

The accuracy of C6 for homonuclear dimers was assessed in Ref. [15] and a detailed discus-
sion for the Rb dimer is given in Ref. [29]. Analyzing the error in this manner using the
quoted coeﬃcients and their uncertainties from Ref. [15] we ﬁnd that most of the disper-
sion coeﬃcients reported here have an estimated uncertainty below 1%. The corresponding
values are given in parentheses in Table I.

In Fig. 2 we present for the dispersion coeﬃcients of the dimers involving Cs a com-
parison between our calculated values and the most recent determinations [6,30]. We give
the percentage deviation from our calculations. It is apparent that the other calculations
that employed one-electron model potentials and accordingly omitted contributions from
core-excited states yield values systematically smaller than ours.

The discrepancies are most signiﬁcant for Cs2 where the number of electrons is greatest.
Fig. 2 also compares the values for the Cs2 dimer with values deduced from ultracold-collision
data [6,30]. The agreement of our prediction 6851(74) [15] with their values for C6 in Cs2 is
close. Core-excited states contribute 15% [31,15] to the value of the C6 coeﬃcient for the Cs
dimer and are needed to fulﬁll the oscillator strength sum rule, Eq. (5). In the present ap-
proach the contributions of core-excited states to dynamic polarizabilities are obtained using
the random-phase approximation, which nonrelativistically satisﬁes the oscillator strength
In the inset of Fig. 1, it is illustrated that our calculated α(iω)
sum rule exactly [25].
approaches N/ω2 as ω becomes asymptotically large, where N = 55 for Cs. While the

4

deviation between the present calculations and the model potential calculations are smaller
for dimers involving lighter atoms, an accurate accounting of core-excited states is essential
to achieve high accuracy in dispersion coeﬃcient calculations for heavy atoms [31–33].

Few experimental data are available for comparison in the heteronuclear case, except for
NaK. The results from investigations of NaK molecular potentials based on spectral analy-
sis [34] are compared to our value in Table II. Our value is smaller than the experimental
values. Earlier theoretical calculations of dispersion coeﬃcients for NaK have been tabu-
lated and evaluated by Marinescu and Sadeghpour [35] and by Zemke and Stwalley [36].
Those values are generally lower than our value of 2447(6) except for that of Maeder and
Kultzelnigg [32] who give 2443.

The present study extends the application of modern relativistic atomic structure meth-
ods to calculations of ground state van der Waals coeﬃcients of Li2 and of the heteronuclear
alkali-metal atoms. We argue that the uncertainty of the coeﬃcients is unlikely to exceed
1%. Additional experimental data from future cold-collision experiments or spectroscopy
would provide further tests of the present calculations.

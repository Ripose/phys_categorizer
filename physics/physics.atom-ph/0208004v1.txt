Experiment and Theory in Computations of the He
Atom Ground State

Abstract

Extensive variational computations are reported for the ground
state energy of the non-relativistic two-electron atom. Several dif-
ferent sets of basis functions were systematically explored, starting
with the original scheme of Hylleraas. The most rapid convergence
is found with a combination of negative powers and a logarithm of
the coordinate s = r1 + r2. At N=3091 terms we pass the previous
best calculation (Korobov’s 25 decimal accuracy with N=5200 terms)
and we stop at N=10257 with E = -2.90372 43770 34119 59831 11592
45194 40444 . . .

Previous mathematical analysis sought to link the convergence rate
of such calculations to speciﬁc analytic properties of the functions in-
volved. The application of that theory to this new experimental data
leaves a rather frustrating situation, where we seem able to do little
more than invoke vague concepts, such as “ﬂexibility.” We conclude
that theoretical understanding here lags well behind the power of avail-
able computing machinery.

1 Introduction

For thousands of years mathematicians have enjoyed competing with one an-
other to compute ever more digits of the number π. Among modern physi-
cists, a close analogy is computation of the ground state energy of the Helium
atom, begun 75 years ago by E. A. Hylleraas [1].

Many have contributed incremental steps in this endeavor, ﬂexing their
computational muscle and ingenuity, often trying to use mathematical insight
for advantage. The strongest line of theory has been to focus on the analytic
properties of the wavefunction, especially following the 1954 work of V. A.
Fock [2] which showed a weak logarithmic singularity at the three-particle
coalescence.

The recent work of V. I. Korobov [3] stands out for its simplicity and
its success. His trial functions use the three scalar coordinates packaged as
e−αr1−βr2−γr12, with many sets of the complex nonlinear parameters α, β, γ
selected in a quasirandom manner within speciﬁed intervals Ai ≤ αi ≤ Bi,
etc. With a linear combination of N=2200 terms of this type, grouped into
four sets [Ai, Bi], Korobov surpassed the best previous work by three decimals
of accuracy in the Helium ground state energy; and more recently he went
on to N=5200 and added four more decimal places.

What struck me as surprising in Korobov’s work was the fact that it
seemed to ignore that earlier “wisdom” about analytic properties of wave-
functions. His basis functions are, analytically, no diﬀerent from the original
Hylleraas basis; yet his computational results appear to converge so much
more rapidly. This perception motivated the investigations reported below.
Section 2 presents the new experimental data - systematic variational
calculations using a variety of diﬀerent basis functions that have been sug-
gested over the years: these include negative powers, fractional powers and
logarithms of the coordinates. Vastly diﬀerent rates of convergence are ob-
served, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Section 3 oﬀers a qualitative discussion and attempts to interpret this
wealth of new data. Section 4 is a review, and an attempt to apply, the
theoretical approach for understanding, at least semi-quantitatively, the ob-
served convergence rates. We conclude that this state of the theory is far
from satisfactory.

2 Experiments - Data

Several diﬀerent sets of basis functions were used in the standard variational
calculations for the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian (with Z=2),

H = −

and they are detailed below in terms of the Hylleraas coordinates,

s = r1 + r2,

t = r1 − r2,

u = r12 = |~x1 − ~x2|.

(2.2)

Table I presents summary results for the primary bases studied. The Ac-
curacy of any energy value E is deﬁned as Log[E*/(E*-E)] where E* is our
best estimate of the exact value. Thus, the numerical value of Accuracy tells
how many correct decimal places there are in the calculated result. Gener-
ally, we see that convergence was found to be more rapid as one progressed
through this series, A,B,C,D,E,F. More detailed discussion of the results will
be deferred to the following sections.

• Basis A is just the original Hylleraas set:

Cl,m,n e−ks/2 sl um tn
l, m = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n = 0, 2, 4, 6, . . .

ψ =

X

(2.3a)
(2.3b)

and we use the order parameter ω = l + m + n to group the terms. We also
designate a calculation of order ω to mean a basis set including all terms
with l + m + n ≤ ω. The total number of terms, N, grows asymptotically
as ω3/12. This same organizational scheme is used for all the experiments
listed below.

• Basis B allows negative powers of s, which were introduced by Kinoshita

[4]:

and we can rearrange the terms as

e−ks/2 sl (u/s)m (t/s)n;

e−ks/2 sl (u/s)m+n Pn(t/u),

(2.4)

(2.5)

using the Legendre polynomials to get the selection rule ∆n = 0, ±2. This
technique follows the work of Goldman [5] and leads to more eﬃcient use of
computer space and time.

2

• Basis C allows fractional powers of s, which were ﬁrst introduced by

H. M. Schwartz [6]:

(1, s1/2) e−ks/2 sl um tn
(2.6)
which doubles the size N of the basis for each order ω. (The s1/2 term is
omitted for ω = 0.)

• Basis D uses the logarithm of s, ﬁrst introduced by Frankowski and

Pekeris [7]:

(1, ln(s)) e−ks/2 sl um tn
(The ln(s) term is omitted for ω = 0, 1. The values of N shown in Tables I
and II are two units oﬀ for bases D and F.)

(2.7)

• Basis E has both negative powers and fractional powers of s.

(1, s1/2) e−ks/2 sl (u/s)m (t/s)n.

• Basis F has both the logarithm and negative powers of s.

(1, ln(s)) e−ks/2 sl (u/s)m (t/s)n.

(2.8)

(2.9)

For each of the basis sets described above, the scale parameter k was
varied somewhat to ﬁnd the lowest energy at each order. For the Table I
data on Basis A, k varied from 5.0 to 8.2; for Basis B, from 3.8 to 5.9; for
Basis C, from 4.7 to 6.6; and for Basis D, from 4.6 to 6.6. For Bases E and F,
it was found that the optimum value of k stayed close to 2.0 for the mid-size
and larger orders, so k was ﬁxed at this value for all the data shown.

In two cases I replaced the set of functions e−ks/2 sl by the set e−αls, using
Korobov’s quasi-random method for selecting the (real) nonlinear parameters
α in a single group. The results for these experiments are shown as Bases B’
and E’ in Table I.

Several variants of these basis sets were also explored brieﬂy but discarded
when they appeared less eﬀective, as functions of N, than their counterparts
above. Among these were the use of:

Negative powers of s and u (u/s)m (t/u)n
Third roots of s instead of the square root
Two or more powers of ln(s)

In Table II are the detailed results (in a compact format) for the two
bases - E and F - that show the most rapid convergence. One quantitative
measure of the rate of convergence is the Ratio of successive diﬀerences and
this is also shown in the table.

Technical notes. For these computations, I wrote a set of subroutines for
multiple-precision arithmetic (in C), eschewing more professional packages
which are available. The last row of data in Table II used 101 decimals of
precision and took one week running on an otherwise idle desktop computer
equipped with a 300 MHz processor and 320 MB of memory.

3 Experiments - Discussion

Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of the convergence rates for the dif-
ferent variational basis sets (A - F), plotting Accuracy versus the Log of N,
the number of basis functions used. I found a number of surprises in these
results.

Surprise 1. Basis B (negative powers of s) shows a signiﬁcant improvement

over basis A (the original Hylleraas basis).

Surprise 2. Bases E and F do a great deal better than any of the others.

Somehow, the beneﬁts of B and C (or B and D) are cumulative.

Surprise 3. The performance of C and D are nearly identical, as with E

and F (until we reach very high orders.)

Surprise 4. The performance of basis E drops oﬀ dramatically after
ω = 27; but basis F keeps up its rapid convergence, although with marked
oscillation, as seen from the Ratios in Table II.

The surprising performance of Korobov’s basis has already been noted:
his published results are shown by the line labelled with the letter “K” in
Figure 1.

The fact that Basis C performs a lot better than Basis A was not a
surprise, since earlier work [8] had already shown that. Ditto for Basis D [7].
Also, the smallness of the gain shown by basis B’ over B (and by E’ over
E) is as expected, based upon the analytic equivalence of exponentials and
power series.

While I cannot explain the surprising results, I can readily oﬀer sugges-
tions on how one might interpret them. The virtue of Bases C and D lies in
providing more ﬂexibility to the “radial” behavior of the wavefunction (coor-
dinate s); while that of the negative powers lies in providing more ﬂexibility
in the “angular” behavior (ratios u/s and t/s). The similarity between C and
D (and between E and F) indicates that the precise analytic behavior in the
“radial” coordinate is not important - any ﬂexibility will do - until one gets
to the very high orders.

This appeal to “ﬂexibility” is just armwaving; it lacks any mathematical
foundation. Such appeal to ﬂexibility is also the best way I know to un-
derstand the success of Korobov’s calculations: his work seems akin to the
“adaptive” techniques used in numerical integration, where one puts addi-
tional mesh points into any region that shows a slower rate of convergence.
In varying the scale parameter k, I most always found a simple minimum

6

in the energy. However, in one case - Basis E at ω = 21 - a more complex
behavior emerged: see Table III. While the variation shown here is not very
great, this does raise the general question of how eﬀectively one may search
for the minimum of a complicated function of many nonlinear parameters.
This is a possible source of worry in using Korobov’s technique, especially
when it comes to error estimation and extrapolation.

4 Theories

The ﬁrst lesson in analysis of atomic wavefunctions concerns the two-particle
cusps: linear behavior as any one of the coordinates r1, r2, or r12 goes to zero.
All of the basis functions studied in this paper are correct in that regard; we
are concerned here with what comes next.

Take the Hylleraas expansion (2.3a) and put it into the Schrodinger equa-
tion (2.1). Then collect the coeﬃcients of each monomial in s, u, and t and
set that equal to zero. Early in this inﬁnite set of algebraic equations for the
expansion coeﬃcients Cl,m,n one ﬁnds the following inconsistent equations

C1,0,0 + ZC0,0,0 = 0
−2C1,1,0 + C1,0,0 = 0
4C1,1,0 − C1,0,0 = 0.

(4.1a)
(4.1b)
(4.1c)

This contradiction in the Hylleraas basis was discovered by Bartlett, Gib-
bons and Dunn [9] in 1935 and it led them to consider an alternative expan-
sion: one that involved logarithms of the hyperradius r =
2. Later,
Fock [2] independently developed a systematic expansion of the wavefunction
with such terms.

1 + r2

q

In 1962 this author [10] developed a general theory about the conver-
gence rate of variational calculations, based upon analogy with least-squares
ﬁtting of functions and one-dimensional model problems. This line of anal-

7

ysis was expanded by others [11] and in some cases given a more rigorous
mathematical basis. [12]

That theoretical work led directly to the idea that the convergence rate
in Hylleraas-type calculations for the Helium ground state was controlled by
the Fock logarithmic singularity; and the semi-quantitative analysis seemed
to ﬁt the available data.
It also led to the successful exploitation of the
fractional power basis C [8]. Shortly thereafter, Frankowski and Pekeris
[7] took logarithmic terms explicitly into their trial functions and this also
seemed to conﬁrm the importance of the Fock behavior.

However, when Kinoshita [4] considered the systematic use of negative
powers - in the form (2.10a), not (2.4) - he found that there was no contra-
diction of the type noted above. I have conﬁrmed that this conclusion holds
also for the basis (2.4) used in the current work.

Thus, one might be drawn to believe that the logarithmic singularity is not
an intrinsic property of the He atom wavefunction itself but rather results
from a particular analysis that relies on the six-dimensional coordinate r.
This idea may be dispelled by reading the work of Myers et al [13], where
they take one for a walk around the three-particle coalescence and show that
the (ﬁnite) discontinuity in the local energy disappears when one includes
the full set of terms that accompany the Fock logarithm.

This approach helps us understand some other experimental results. We
noted earlier that inclusion of negative powers t/u gave poorer results than
t/s. Each of these ratios shows a (ﬁnite) discontinuity when one walks around
the place where the denominator vanishes - something that the correct wave-
function should not allow. In the case of (t/u) this error occurs along a line,
while in the case of (t/s) this error occurs only at a point. A similar situa-
tion appears in the work of Goldman [5], who holds the previous record for
basis size (N=8066). His use of the coordinates r<, r> led to a very eﬃcient
computational scheme, but demonstrates relatively slow convergence. (See
the point “G” in Figure 1.) This may be attributed to the discontinuity of
his basis functions on the 2-dimensional surface r1 = r2.

4.1 Fitting the Data

The goal of a good theoretical understanding should be the ability to pre-
dict or to explain, at least semi-quantitatively, the observed rates of con-
vergence for systematic variational calculations with diﬀerent basis sets. In

8

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

(4.2c)

(4.3)

(4.4)

my earlier work [10], the attempt to do this was based upon analogies with
one-dimensional model problems, doing least-squares ﬁt with appropriate
orthogonal bases to represent functions with various types of singularities:

Minimize

ρ(x)dx [f (x) −

Ciui(x)]2

Z

n−1

Xi=0

Ci =

ρ(x)dxf (x)ui(x)

Z

Error ≈ (Cn)2.

For one example we ﬁnd:

f (x) = xν lnx,

ρ(x) = xµ
Cn ∼ 1/nµ+2ν+3/2;

on the interval (0,1)

and an alternative example is:

f (x) = xν lnx,

ρ(x) = xµe−x

on the interval (0,∞)

Cn ∼ 1/nµ/2+ν+1.

The diﬀerence in convergence rates for these two examples may be understood
qualitatively as follows. The basis functions xne−x peak at x = n. Therefore,
at higher n these basis functions on the interval (0, ∞) get farther and farther
away from the singularity, which is at x = 0. One may improve the situation
by using basis functions xne−kx, where k is a scale parameter that may grow
as one proceeds to higher orders. I do not have a quantitative theory for this
result but it is qualitatively relevant to the current study.

In my 1962 work I applied this simple modeling to the He atom problem,
identifying the Fock term r2lnr as the dominant singularity which is neglected
in conventional Hylleraas coordinates. This led me to predict a convergence
rate formula,

E(ω) − E(ω − 1) ∼ const./ωp

(4.5)

and I estimated that p should be between 5.5 and 10, due to uncertainties
in replacing the real 3-dimensional problem with the one-dimensional model.
The then best results with Hylleraas variables (work of Pekeris, 1959, up
to order 21, using a cleverly orthogonalized basis) ﬁt the convergence rate
formula (4.5) with a value of p between 7 and 8. This was good conﬁrmation

9

of the theory. The extended computations reported here (Basis A data in
Table I) ﬁt the convergence rate formula (4.5) with a value of p which varies
from 7, at the lower orders, to a value about 12 at the higher orders. This
improvement is probably due to my allowing the scale parameter k to vary,
which was not done in the earlier work.

Also, in 1962, I introduced the half-powers of coordinate s, explicitly for
the purpose of increasing the convergence rate, following this theory. That
was successful, with the observed value of p approximately doubled to 14 or
15 at ω ≤ 8. The extended computations reported here (Basis C data in
Table I) are ﬁt to values of p which vary from about 16 to 21. Again, this
is fairly good conﬁrmation of the theory; and again we acknowledge some
improvement by allowing the scale parameter to vary.

Following that earlier theory one would certainly not expect Basis D to
converge at the same rate as Basis C – but this is exactly the behavior we
have found in the present experiments.

What can I say about the observed convergence rate of Basis B, intro-
ducing negative powers into the Hylleraas functions? The data in Table I are
ﬁt with a value of the exponent p around 13. I do not understand this but
will only oﬀer a guess that it may have to do with ﬁtting the complex “angu-
lar” behavior around the Fock singularity, which was described in Ref. [13].
Maybe this is connected with the diﬀerence in convergence rates noted above,
in Eqs. (4.3, 4.4), for the model problems on (0,1) and on (0,∞ ).

Finally, look at the results for Bases E and F. The data in Tables I and
II are ﬁt with values of the exponent p which grow from the 20’s to the 40’s
in the middle range of ω; at the top end, the data for Basis E drop to around
p=25, while the data for Basis F climb to about p = 65. I am at a loss to
explain these large exponents following the former analysis.

An alternative to the power law convergence rate formula (4.5) is the

exponential rate formula

E(ω) − E(ω − 1) ∼ const.(σ)ω

(4.6)

which one could expect from a model ﬁtting problem that involved no singu-
larities at all. For example, expanding e−ax in terms of xn e−bx would yield
the formula (4.6) with σ = ( a−b
a+b)2. If one plots the data for Basis F (Log of
increments in E vs. ω), it does look close to a straight line; and the smoothed
data in Table II may be ﬁtted with a value of σ in the range 0.13 - 0.16 for

10

ω > 16. If one looks at the asymptotic behavior of the He wavefunction as
r1 goes to inﬁnity, the behavior in r2 should be as e−Zr2 with Z = 2. The
trial functions I used for this basis have the exponential envelope e−k(r1+r2)/2
with k = 2. Using the formula quoted above, this model gives us the param-
eter σ as ( 2−1
2+1)2 = 0.11. This looks like a fairly good ﬁt to the data; but
accepting this explanation would lead us to doubt the relevance of the Fock
singularities for the He wavefunction.

Also, I know of no published theoretical attempts to explain the excel-
lent convergence found by Korobov with his highly nonlinear ﬁtting of the
trial wavefunction. John Morgan has suggested (in private communication)
that Korobov’s approach may be likened to the work of ﬁtting the Hydrogen
radial wavefunction with a set of gaussians, using “ﬂoating exponents”[14].
This sounds plausible, but at present it is just more handwaving about “ﬂex-
ibility.”.

I conclude that theoretical understanding of the convergence of variational
calculations on the two-electron atom is far outstripped by the raw computing
power of available machinery.

Some may ask if any of this is really relevant to current issues in physics.
One response is to point to high accuracy measurements performed on atomic
systems which may check the current theories of fundamental particles and
interactions. A recent paper by Pachucki and Sapirstein [15] aims to deter-
mine the ﬁne structure constant to a few parts-per-billion. This is based
upon measurements of the 23PJ states in Helium and detailed calculations
that rely upon a Korobov-type representation of the atomic wavefunction.

Then, again, all this may be nothing more than an expression of π-envy.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I am grateful to John D. Morgan III for several very helpful discussions.

Appendix: Integrals

here:

Integrals of the following type were needed in the calculations reported

∞

Z
0

ds e−s sp (ln(s))q.

(A.1)

There is a simple recursion formula on the index p; and for the minimum
values of p I used a particular technique of numerical integration. (See Ref.
[16].) First change variables, s = exp(y); then use the simple rule,

∞

Z

−∞

∞

Xn=−∞

f (y) dy ≈ h

f (nh).

(A.2)

The summation is truncated when terms are smaller than the desired accu-
racy; and the answer converges exponentially as the interval h is decreased.

For the two-electron atom, one can evaluate the most conventional inte-

grals from the formula,

d3x1
4π Z

d3x2
4π

Z

e−ar1
r1

e−br2
r2

e−cr12
r12

=

1
(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

,

(A.3)

and derivatives of this simple result with respect to the parameters a,b,c.

In exploring more complicated functions, I was able to ﬁnd another simple

formula for the following integral, which involves R = |~x1 + ~x2|.
e−br2
r2
1
(a2 + b2 − 2c2 − 2d2)

d3x1
4π Z

e−cr12
r12

e−ar1
r1

e−dR
R

d3x2
4π

(a + b + 2c)(a + b + 2d)
2(a + c + d)(b + c + d)

ln

=

Z

.

(A.4)

To derive this, insert the Laplacian operators into the middle of the integral
and let them work both ways. It appears that one could almost deduce these
results (A.3) and (A.4) purely by arguments of analyticity and symmetry.
Consider, for example, how the integral behaves as r1 → ∞: by counting
powers one sees the nature of the singularity as (a+c), or (a+c+d), goes to
zero.

As noted earlier, using this variable R in the He trial wavefunction did
not produce good results - as one might expect since it introduces a spurious
cusp when the two electrons are on opposite sides of the nucleus.
I have,
nevertheless, recorded the above information here in case it might be useful
to others.

The result (A.4) can be generalized with R = |µ~x1 + ν~x2|.

We theoretically examine a zero-temperature system of Fermi degenerate atoms coupled to bosonic
molecules via collisionless rapid adiabatic passage across a Feshbach resonance, focusing on satu-
ration of the molecular conversion eﬃciency at the slowest magnetic-ﬁeld sweep rates. Borrowing
a novel many-fermion Fock-state theory, we ﬁnd that a proper model of the magnetic-ﬁeld sweep
can systematically remove saturation. We also debunk the common misconception that many-body
eﬀects are responsible for molecules existing above the two-body threshold.

Introduction.–Magnetoassociation creates a molecule
from a pair of colliding atoms when one of the atoms
spin ﬂips in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld tuned near
a Feshbach resonance [1]. Recently, ultracold [2, 3] and
condensate [4] molecules have been created via magne-
toassociation of a Fermi gas of atoms, in the course of
eﬀorts to create superﬂuid Cooper-paired atoms [5, 6]
(see also Refs. [7]). The backbone of these experiments is
rapid adiabatic passage: the ground state of the Feshbach
system is all atoms far above the molecular-dissociation
threshold and all molecules far below it, so that a slow
sweep of the magnetic ﬁeld from one extreme to the other
converts atoms into diatomic molecules.

Finite-temperature mean-ﬁeld theory of magnetoasso-
ciation of a Fermi gas of atoms leads to two types of insta-
bilities against molecule formation. One is the thermo-
dynamic instability of a Fermi sea against the formation
of Cooper pairs [8], a trait of superconductors whose ana-
log is passed on to Feshbach-resonant superﬂuids [9]. A
thermodynamical instability occurs because pairing low-
ers the energy, and coupling to a reservoir with a low
enough temperature leaves the system prone to pairing.
The other is a dynamical instability, whereby the larger
state space of the molecules, owing somewhat to Pauli
blocking, leaves the atoms prone to spontaneous associa-
tion [10]. The role that temperature plays in this process
remains an open question.

Physically [10], high temperature lessens the chance of
an atom occupying an arbitrary level in the Fermi sea, the
dynamical instability becomes less eﬀective and the eﬃ-
ciency of even the slowest rapid adiabatic passage there-
fore saturates (c.f., Fig. 1). The mean-ﬁeld theory be-
hind this understanding agrees semi-quantitatively with
experiments [2]; nevertheless, a recent zero-temperature
Landau-Zener theory predicts that saturation is fun-
damental [11].
If temperature is not a limiting fac-
tor, then any zero-temperature model of rapid adia-

FIG. 1: Predicted temperature dependence of the eﬃciency
(|β|2) of rapid adiabatic passage from quantum degenerate
40K atoms to 40K2 molecules. As the temperature in Fermi
units (~εF /kB) is lowered, atoms become more likely to par-
ticipate in forming molecules. The magnetic ﬁeld was swept
linearly at the (inverse) rate 1/ ˙B = 400µs/G. Figure repro-

batic passage should ultimately display saturation, e.g.,
a Fock-state approach similar to the theory of cooper-
ative association of Bose-Fermi mixtures of atoms into
Fermi molecules [12]. Unfortunately, computing power
is presently suﬃcient for calculations with only about 20
atoms total at the absolute very best, precluding any
brute-force [12] test of saturation. Here we apply a novel
large-fermion-number theory [13] to demonstrate near-
unit-eﬃcient rapid adiabatic passage in the limit of zero
temperature, thereby ruling out any fundamental ceiling
to the molecular conversion, and bolstering Ref. [10] (and
also Ref. [14]).

This development is outlined as follows. After brieﬂy
introducing the collisionless model, we focus on rapid

adiabatic passage and conﬁrm the reduced-space map-
ping [13] by comparison with exact few-particle results.
102, we then
Increasing the total particle number to 2
observe what appears to be saturation at about
50%.
However, including ﬂuctuation eﬀects in the rate at which
the system is swept across the Feshbach resonance, we
ﬁnd that saturation can be systematically removed, and
near-unit eﬃciency can be achieved for any particle num-
ber. Lastly, from the single pair results we also debunk
the commonly held notion that many-body eﬀects are re-
sponsible for the existence of molecules above the thresh-
old for molecular dissociation.

Collisionless Gas Model.–We model an ideal two-
component gas of fermionic atoms coupled by a Fesh-
bach resonance to bosonic molecules.
In the language
of second-quantization, an atom of mass m and momen-
tum ~k is described by the annihilation operator ak,1(2),
and a molecule of mass 2m and similar momentum is
described by the annihilation operator bk. All operators
obey their (anti)commutation relations. The microscopic
Hamiltonian for such a freely-ideal system is written:

where repeated greek indices imply a summation (σ =
1, 2). The free-particle energy is ~ǫk = ~2k2/2m, the
atom (molecule) chemical potential is ~µσ(mol), and the
detuning δ is a measure of the binding energy of the
molecule (δ > 0 is taken as above threshold), the mode-
1/√V with
independent atom-molecule coupling is κ
V is the quantization volume.

We have already imposed the ideal conditions for atom-
molecule conversion with µ1 = µ2 = µ. An appropriate
unitary transformation then shuﬄes µ into the deﬁni-
tion of µmol which, in turn, can be absorbed into the
detuning and written oﬀ as an eﬀectively dc bias (see
also Refs. [12]). Since magnetoassociation usually occurs
much faster than any trapped-particle motion, an explicit
trap can be neglected along with the free-particle energies

a more full use of the reduced-space theory, Fig. 2(b)
illustrates that the eﬃciency of rapid adiabatic passage
in fact decreases for increasing particle number, saturat-
ing at about 50% for N = 102. Nevertheless, if we ac-
count for ﬂuctuations, then the relevant frequency scale
is Ω/ ln N [16]. Now the detuning should change by
Ω/ ln N in a time (Ω/ ln N )−1, suggesting the detuning-

the nature of above-threshold molecules. Below thresh-
old (δ < 0), Fourier analysis delivers the binding en-
ergy, ~ωB < 0, of the Bose-condensed molecules [10, 18]:
Σ′(ωB) + iη = 0, where Σ′(ωB) is the ﬁnite
ωB
self-energy of the Bose molecules and η = 0+. Tun-
ing the system above the two-body threshold (δ > 0)
gives an imaginary ωB, and the bound state ceases to
exist; nevertheless, Fig. 3 shows a large N = 1 molecular
fraction. This result is not really a surprise, since the
fraction of molecules must vary continuously from zero
to unity across threshold. We conclude that any theory
in which molecules abruptly cease to exist at threshold,
while useful in their own right (e.g., for modeling bind-
ing energies [10]), are not a good rule of thumb for pre-
dicting the existence of above-threshold molecules. Our
interpretation is that, as usual in cooperative behavior,
a macroscopic number of particles respond as a unit to
a given external drive, thereby mimicking one- or two-
body physics. As such, the existence, per say, of above-
threshold molecules is not a many-body eﬀect. On the
contrary, we see in Fig. 3 that the above-threshold molec-
ular fraction is in fact suppressed for the many-body case
N = 102.

Conclusions.–We have investigated saturation in rapid
adiabatic passage from a two-component degenerate
Fermi gas to a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules.
Saturation indeed arises, but can be systematically elim-
inated by properly introducing the timescale for ﬂuc-
tuations. This result can be understood physically in
terms of constructive interference: cooperative eﬀects
arise from adding up the various pathways coupling the
states having N
m molecules and m dissociated atom
pairs with the states having one more (less) molecules
and one less (more) dissociated pair, and the timescale

FIG. 3: Fraction of above-threshold molecular condensate for
N = 100 (from Fig. 2(c), dashed) compared to ground-state
N = 1 (solid line). Rather than arising from many-body
eﬀects, it appears that many-body eﬀects act to suppress the
molecular fraction.

perfect sense that cooperative, or near-unit-eﬃcient and
macroscopic, rapid adiabatic passage will only occur
over a timescale that is commensurate with construc-
tive interference. Next we saw that our zero-temperature
model agrees semi-quantitatively with our mean-ﬁeld
model [10],
indicating that temperature [10] and pair
correlations [14] are–as of yet–the main obstacles to co-
operative conversion. Finally, whereas studies of Fesh-
bach resonances for both fermions and bosons have im-

plicated many-body eﬀects in the existence of molecules
above the two-body threshold for dissociation, we have
shown that the opposite is actually true: above-threshold
molecules exist in their own right, and many-body eﬀects
actually suppress the molecular fraction compared to the
two-body result.

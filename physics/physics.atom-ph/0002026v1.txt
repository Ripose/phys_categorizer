Abstract

We report a measurement of the lifetime of the 3d 2D5/2
metastable level in 40Ca+, using quantum jumps of a sin-
gle cold calcium ion in a linear Paul trap. The 4s 2S1/2–
3d 2D5/2 transition is signiﬁcant for single-ion optical fre-
quency standards, astrophysical references, and tests of
atomic structure calculations. We obtain τ = 1.168 ±
0.007 s from observation of nearly 64, 000 quantum jumps
during ∼ 32 hours. Our result is more precise and sig-
niﬁcantly larger than previous measurements. Experi-
ments carried out to quantity systematic eﬀects included
a study of a previously unremarked source of systematic
error, namely excitation by the broad background of ra-
diation emitted by a semiconductor diode laser. Com-
bining our result with atomic structure calculations yields
1.20 ± 0.01 s for the lifetime of 3d 2D3/2. We also use
quantum jump observations to demonstrate photon anti-
bunching, and to estimate background pressure and heat-
ing rates in the ion trap.

Introduction

In this paper we present a measurement of the natural
lifetime τ of the 3d 2D5/2 metastable level in singly-ionised
calcium, using quantum jumps of a single cold calcium ion
in a linear Paul trap. The 3D5/2 level is of interest as
the source of an optical frequency standard at 729 nm
with 1/τ ∼ 1 Hz natural linewidth [1], as a means of
testing atomic structure calculations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
and as a diagnostic in astrophysics [9, 3].
In addition,
our experiments oﬀer insights into the diagnostics on the
performance of the Paul trap, and highlight the need to
take into account the spectral properties of semiconductor
diode laser emission when such devices are used in atomic
physics experiments.

Our result is τ = 1.168 ± 0.007 s, and is shown together
with other recent measurements and theoretical predic-
tions in ﬁgure 1. Our result is higher (a longer lifetime)
than all the previous measurements, and diﬀers by sev-
eral standard deviations from most of them. It is possible
that this discrepancy is at least partly due to a previously
unrecognised source of systematic error, namely the pres-

ence of light of wavelength in the vicinity of 854 nm in the
beam produced by a semiconductor diode laser emitting
predominantly at 866 nm. This is discussed in section 4.1.
Precise knowledge of atomic structure for atoms or ions
with a single electron outside closed shells is currently in
demand for the analysis of atomic physics tests of electro-
weak theory, especially measurements of parity violation
in Cs [10]. There has been a long-standing discrepancy at
the 2% level between measured and theoretically predicted
rates for electric dipole transitions [11]. Up until now mea-
surements of the metastable lifetimes (electric quadrupole
transition rates) in Ca+ have not been suﬃciently precise
to provide an independent test of ab initio calculations
at this level of precision. Our measurement precision is
0.6 %. Furthermore the electric quadrupole transition rate
is harder to calculate accurately (recent calculated values
have a 15% spread), so our result is of particular interest
to atomic structure theory.

The paper is organized as follows. First we discuss, in
section 2, the central features of our experimental method
to measure τ . Details of the apparatus are provided in
section 3. This is a completely new apparatus which has
not been described elsewhere, so we give a reasonably full
description.

Section 4 presents our study of systematic eﬀects in the
experiment. These include collisions with the background
gas, oﬀ-resonant excitation of the 854 nm 3D5/2–4P3/2
transition and of the 850 nm 3D3/2–4P1/2 transition, heat-
ing of the trapped ion, and noise in the ﬂuorescence sig-
nal. Section 5 contains a clean demonstration of photon
anti-bunching, using the random telegraph method, and
section 6 presents the ﬁnal accurate measurements of τ .

2 Experimental method

The experimental method was identical, in principle, to
that adopted by Block et al.
[12]; preliminary experi-
ments were carried out somewhat diﬀerently (see section
5). A single ion of 40Ca+ is trapped and laser-cooled to
around 1 mK. The transitions of interest are shown in
ﬁgure 2. Laser beams at 397 nm and 866 nm continu-
ously illuminate the ion, and the ﬂuorescence at 397 nm
is detected by a photomultiplier. The photon count signal

1

is accumulated for periods of duration tb = 10.01 ms (of
which 2.002 ms is dead time), and logged. In our studies
of systematic eﬀects, and for our demonstration of photon
antibunching, tb was set at 22.022 ms. A laser at 850 nm
drives the 3D3/2–4P3/2 transition. The most probable de-
cay route from 4P3/2 is to the 4S1/2 ground state; alter-
natively, the ion can return to 3D3/2. However, about 1
decay in 18 occurs to 3D5/2, the metastable “shelving”
level of interest. At this point the ﬂuorescence abruptly
disappears and the observed photon count signal falls to
a background level. A shutter on the 850 nm laser beam
remains open for 100 ms before it is closed, which gives
ample time for shelving. Between 5 and 10 ms after the
shutter has closed, we begin one “observation”, i.e., we
start to record the photomultiplier count signal (see ﬁgure
3a). We keep observing the photon count, in the 10 ms
bins, until it abruptly increases to a level above a thresh-
old. This is set between the background level and the
level observed when the ion ﬂuoresces continuously. The
signature for the end of a dark period is taken to be ten
consecutive bins above threshold. We record the number
of 10 ms bins in the observed ‘dark’ period. The 100 ms
period of ﬂuoresence also serves to allow the 397 nm and
866 nm lasers to cool the ion. After this we re-open the
shutter on the 850 nm laser. This process is repeated for
long periods of time (1 to 8 hours), the laser intensities
being also monitored and the frequencies servo-controlled.
Subsequent analysis of the large collection of dark times
consists primarily of gathering them into a histogram, and
ﬁtting the expected exponential distribution, in order to
derive the decay rate from the shelved state (see ﬁgure 4).
Note that we do not measure the length of the dark
period from when the ion is ﬁrst shelved. This is not
necessary, since the probability of decay is independent of
how long the ion has been in the metastable state. This
gives us time to block the 850 nm light, in order to prevent
both oﬀ-resonant excitation of the ion by this light, and
the possibility of missed quantum jumps should this light
rapidly (in less than 5 ms) re-shelve a decayed ion.

The data from a given run were analysed as follows. The
raw data consist of a series of counts indicating the aver-
age ﬂuorescence level in each bin of duration tb. A thresh-
old is set, typically at (2Sdark + Sbright)/3, where Sdark is
the mean count observed during dark periods, and Sbright
the mean count observed during ﬂuorescing periods. This
setting is chosen because bright periods have more noise
than dark periods. The number of consecutive bins below
threshold is a single dark-time measurement xi. The xi
are expected to be distributed according to the exponen-
tial decay law, with Poissonian statistics describing the
departures from the mean. It is appropriate to use a Pois-
sonian ﬁtting method, rather than least squares, because
of the small numbers involved in part of the distribution
(at large t). If n(ti) is the number of xi equal to ti/tb then

the cost function is

− ln" m
Yi=0

P (n(ti))# =

m

Xi=0(cid:2)Ae−γti + ln (n(ti)!)
−n(ti) ln A + n(ti)γti]

(1)

where m is the number of bins, and A and γ are two ﬁtted
parameters (obtained by minimising the cost function);
they are the amplitude and decay rate in the assumed ex-
ponential decay A exp(−γt) of population of D5/2. The
residuals shown in ﬁgure 4 indicate that our data are well
ﬁtted by an exponential function. Only dark times of du-
ration less than 5 s are included in the ﬁt, since our data
collection procedure misses some dark times longer than
this. We found that the statistical error in the ﬁtted pa-
rameters was consistent with the expected √N /N value,
where N is the number of xi in the whole data set.

3 Apparatus

We use a linear radio-frequency (r.f.) Paul trap, combined
with an all-diode laser system, to isolate and cool a single
ion of 40Ca+. The electrodes are made from stainless steel
rods and mounted on two supports made from machinable
ceramic (Macor); an end view is shown in ﬁgure 5. The
radial r.f. electrodes, of diameter 1.2 mm, are centred at
the corners of a square of side 2.6 mm. The d.c. endcap
electrodes, of diameter 1.0 mm are centred on the z-axis
and positioned 7.2 mm apart. In addition to the electrodes
which comprise the trap, there are a further four 1.6 mm
diameter electrodes positioned in a similar conﬁguration
to that of the r.f. electrodes, but centred at the corners of
a 8.4 mm square. These electrodes allow potentials to be
added to compensate for stray electric ﬁelds in the trap-
ping region.

The

apparatus

is

complete

experimental

shown
schematically in ﬁgure 6, to which we refer in the remain-
der of this section. The trap electrodes lie at the centre
of a hexagonal stainless steel vacuum chamber. A high-
voltage a.c. source RF supplies a drive voltage of frequency
6.2 MHz and peak-to-peak amplitude 135 V for the radial
electrodes, while high-voltage d.c. supplies DC provide the
voltages for the endcaps (95 V in the present experiments)
and compensation electrodes (typically around 60 V are
applied to the upper two compensation electrodes, while
the lower two are grounded).

The central chamber is pumped by a 25 l/s ion pump IP
and a 30 l/s getter pump GP. An ion gauge IG on the oppo-
site side of the main chamber monitors the pressure; this is
below 2×10−11 torr, the limit of the gauge’s sensitivity. To
produce calcium ions in the trapping region, we use a cal-
cium oven c and electron gun e. The oven is a thin-walled
stainless steel tube ﬁlled with calcium granules, closed by
crimping at each end and with a small hole at the centre
pointing towards the trap region. The oven is heated by
passing a 6 A current along its length, which produces a

2

beam of calcium atoms. The electron gun consists of a
tungsten ﬁlament, also resistively heated, enclosed within
a grounded stainless steel “grid” with respect to which it
is negatively biased by 50 V. To load the trap, the oven
and electron gun are heated for a few minutes, the latter
being left on for 10 s after the oven has been turned oﬀ.
We capture a small cloud of approximately 10 calcium ions
using this procedure. This cloud is reduced to a single ion
by applying to one of the endcaps a low-voltage “tickle”
oscillation, close to the axial resonance frequency of the
trap, expelling ions until only one remains in the trap.

Violet light at 397 nm is generated by frequency-
doubling 794 nm light from a master-slave diode laser sys-
tem. A grating-stabilized master diode 794M, with a
linewidth below 1 MHz, is locked to a stabilized low-ﬁnesse
reference cavity RC and used to inject a slave diode 794S.
Light from the slave is frequency-doubled by a 10 mm long
Brewster-cut lithium triborate crystal LBO in an external
enhancement cavity; H¨ansch-Couillaud polarization anal-
ysis of light reﬂected by the cavity provides a feedback sig-
nal for a piezo-mounted mirror PZT used to lock the cavity
length to the fundamental light. The measured character-
istics of the doubling cavity are: ﬁnesse 130, enhancement
43, mode-matching eﬃciency 94%, input power 90 mW at
794 nm, output power 0.50 mW at 397 nm. Correcting for
losses at the exit face of the crystal and the output cou-
pler gives an internal crystal eﬃciency γ = 54(5) µW/W2,
some 20% greater than previously reported values [13, 14]
and about 75% of the theoretical optimum eﬃciency calcu-
lated using a Boyd-Kleinman analysis [15] and an eﬀective
non-linear coeﬃcient for LBO of deﬀ = 0.855 pm/V [16].
The 397 nm beam passes through a λ/2 waveplate and
polarizing beam splitter (PBS) cube to provide intensity
control, and a lens focuses it to a spot size of 200× 30 µm
(measured with a CCD camera) at the centre of the trap.
The beam power used is typically 0.2 mW.

A grating-stabilized diode laser 866 provides repump-
ing light at 866 nm whose intensity is adjusted by a
λ/2 waveplate and PBS cube. A heated iodine bromide
vapour cell IBr provides an absolute frequency reference—
unfortunately not suitable for reliable locking—and a
triple-pass acousto-optic modulator AOM shifts the laser
light some 650 MHz into resonance with the 3D3/2 →
4P1/2 calcium transition. Spontaneous light near 854 nm
emitted by the laser diode (see section 4.1.2) is rejected by
a diﬀraction grating DG and aperture A. The transmitted
866 nm light is superimposed on the 397 nm beam using a
PBS cube and focused onto the trap. The spot size used
in the ﬁnal lifetime measurements was 250 × 130 µm; the
maximum beam power was 2 mW.
The light at 850 nm to shelve the ion is provided by a
third grating-stabilized laser diode 850 situated on a sep-
arate optical table, and is directed into the ion trap via a
polarization-preserving monomode optical ﬁbre. The in-
tensity is controlled by a λ/2 waveplate before the optical
isolator. A mechanical shutter S before the ﬁbre allows
complete extinction of this light. The spot size at the

trap is 450 × 450 µm and the maximum power 0.5 mW.
For clarity in ﬁgure 6 the detection optics are shown
in the plane of the diagram: they are actually vertically
above the ion trap. A wide-aperture compound lens gath-
ers ﬂuorescence emitted by the trapped ion and images it
onto an aperture to reject scattered light; further lenses
re-image the light, via a violet ﬁlter, onto a photomul-
tiplier PMT connected to a gated photon counter. The
net collection eﬃciency of the detection system, includ-
ing the 16% quantum eﬃciency of the PMT at 397 nm, is
approximately 0.12%. The peak photon count rate above
background for a single cooled ion is typically 32 kHz.

A personal computer PC is used for data acquisition
and control of the experiment; in particular it provides
timing, logs PMT count data, controls the shutter S, and
eliminates long-term drift of the 866 nm laser by locking
it to the ﬂuorescence signal from the trapped ion at the
end of each 20 s acquisition period.

4 Searches for systematic eﬀects

We now consider eﬀects which alter the measured shelving
periods from those appropriate to an unperturbed ion sub-
ject only to spontaneous decay. These are of two distinct
types: those which alter the shelving periods themselves,
because the ion is perturbed in some way, and those which
cause systematic error in the process of measurement. We
consider the two in turn. The signiﬁcant diﬀerence be-
tween our ﬁnal result and previous work calls for a detailed
discussion here.

4.1 Perturbations to the ion

When the ion is ﬂuorescing, it is cycling between the levels
4 2S1/2, 4 2P1/2 and 3 2D3/2. We denote this system of
levels by Λ. During the shelving period, the ion is subject
to radiation from two of the lasers (397 nm and 866 nm),
to thermal radiation, and to the ﬁelds associated with the
trap. There may also be collisions with the background
gas. Any of these perturbations can transfer the ion to
the Λ system. We consider them in turn.

4.1.1 Electric ﬁeld

The ion experiences a static electric ﬁeld because of im-
perfect compensation. The most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the
internal state of the ion is to mix the 3D5/2 and 4P3/2
levels, so that the measured lifetime is shortened by the
presence of the induced 4P3/2–4S1/2 strong electric dipole
transition. In fact, using the known matrix elements, one
ﬁnds that the eﬀect is negligible; the induced transition
probability is 9.0 × 10−14E2 s−1, so that a ﬁeld of 300 kV
m−1 (three orders of magnitude larger than the typical
compensating ﬁelds used) would be necessary to produce
a 1% reduction in the lifetime. We note, however, that

3

there is another eﬀect associated with an imperfectly com-
pensated ﬁeld, that of heating during the shelving period;
we consider this in section 4.2.1.

4.1.2 Laser radiation

From the standard theory of atom-light interaction, one
ﬁnds that transitions from a lower level (1) to a higher level
(2) in the multi-level ion can be stimulated by radiation
of intensity I and angular frequency ωL at a rate R12
(averaged over all Zeeman components) given by

R12 =

2J2 + 1
2J1 + 1

π2c3
¯hω3
12

A21

I
c

g(ωL − ω12)

(2)

where J1 and J2 are the total angular momenta of the
levels, ω12 is the atomic resonance angular frequency, and
g(ωL − ω12) is the normalised lineshape function. In our
case we may assume Lorentzian lineshapes, so that

g(ωL − ω12) =

Γ/(2π)

(ωL − ω12)2 + Γ2/4

(3)

with the linewidth Γ = 1/τ2 determined by the sum of all
the decay processes from the upper level.

Since Block et al. [12] reported a signiﬁcant dependence
of the shelving time on the intensity of the repumping
laser, we ﬁrst consider excitation from 3D5/2 to 4P3/2 by
light at 866 nm. The lifetime τ2 of the 4P3/2 level has
been measured to be 6.924 ± 0.019 ns [11]. We use the
value A21 = (7.7 ± 0.3) × 106 s−1 from ab initio [7] and
semiempirical [17] atomic structure calculations. The 4%
uncertainty is our own estimate, based on the variation
among the published calculations, and on the fact that the
calculations produce other electric dipole matrix elements
in agreement with experiment to better than this level of
precision.
In any case a 10% error in the value of A21
would have a negligible inﬂuence on our ﬁnal result.

To excite the 3D5/2–4P3/2 transition on resonance
would require radiation of wavelength 854 nm. From
equation (2), we ﬁnd that with 866 nm light the rate is
9.9 × 10−5 s−1/mW mm−2. The probability that the ion
will subsequently decay back to 3D5/2 is the branching ra-
tio b = A21τ2 = 0.053, so the rate at which it will be trans-
ferred to the Λ system is (1− b)R12 = 9.4× 10−5 s−1/mW
mm−2. In our experiments, it is convenient to choose the
866 nm intensity such that the 3D3/2 → 4P1/2 transition
is saturated. This requires I866 ≫ 0.08 mW mm−2 if the
laser frequency is set on resonance (taking this A21 coeﬃ-
cient 8.4×106 s−1 [7, 17]), but to avoid the need to control
this frequency precisely a much higher intensity was used,
typically 1.5 mW in a spot size of 250 × 130 µm, or 30
mW mm−2. This results in a contribution to the depopu-
lation rate of the 3D5/2 level of around 0.3% of that due
to spontaneous emission to the ground level.

This is far smaller than the experimental result of Block
et al. However, in our own preliminary work we also found
that there was a signiﬁcant dependence of the shelving

time on the intensity of the repumper laser, of the same
order of magnitude as that reported by Block et al., and
some 200 times larger than the theoretical value given
above. This suggested that the 866 nm laser was emitting
some radiation much closer in wavelength to 854 nm which
was primarily responsible for the shortening of the appar-
ent lifetime of the 3D5/2 level. This laser is a semicon-
ductor diode device, operated with an extended cavity by
use of a Littrow-mounted diﬀraction grating. Without the
grating, the laser would operate close to 854 nm. Since any
laser produces spontaneous emission over its gain proﬁle,
as well as stimulated emission at the lasing wavelength,
there was in our preliminary work radiation incident on
the ion in the vicinity of 854 nm. One might expect the
intensity of this radiation to be greatly reduced because of
the long (3m) beam path. In fact, this is not the case, be-
cause the emitting region in the laser is small (dimensions
of order microns) so the spontaneous component is well
collimated; like the coherent component, it is transported
to the trap with little loss.

We therefore investigated the spectrum of the light from
the laser by means of a diﬀraction grating, and found it
to contain a broad background from 840 nm to 870 nm.
When the total laser power near the ion trap was 2 mW,
the power in the broad component was 8 µW, and the spot
sizes were similar. This implies a mean spectral density
around 854 nm suﬃcient to cause de-shelving rates con-
siderably higher than those we observed; we ascribe the
lower observed rates to the structure of the background.
This was not resolved in our investigation, but is expected
on the basis of other experimental work [18, 19] to include
a long series of spikes separated by the longitudinal mode
spacing of the diode (50 GHz). These occur because the
gain is so high in these devices that there is some am-
pliﬁcation right across the gain proﬁle; evidence that this
occurs in our laser is provided by the high degree of po-
larization (90%) of the background. It is thus reasonable
to conclude that the 3D5/2–4P3/2 atomic resonance falls
between peaks in the 50 GHz spaced comb.

To study the eﬀects of this background radiation we
reduced its intensity at the position of the ion. This was
done in two stages: ﬁrst, we reduced it by a factor of 25 us-
ing an interference ﬁlter centred on 866 nm. The observed
de-shelving rate fell from 1.85 ± 0.06 s−1 to 0.87 ± 0.02
s−1, the two measurements being taken at the same 866
nm intensity. This provided convincing evidence that the
de-shelving was indeed caused by the postulated mecha-
nism. We therefore replaced the ﬁlter with a diﬀraction
grating and iris aperture, arranged to pass light at 866 nm.
The power transmitted by the system in the vicinity of 854
nm was then reduced compared with the unﬁltered laser
by three and a half orders of magnitude (for a given in-
tensity at 866 nm), and the remaining light was scattered,
thus increasing the illuminated area in the vicinity of the
ion by a factor measured to be 40, making a net intensity
reduction 8 × 10−6. Under these conditions transitions
stimulated by this radiation become much less probable

4

than those due to the 866 nm light itself. The observed
de-shelving rate was 0.858 ± 0.007 s−1. De-shelving rates
γ at various settings of the intensity I of the 866 nm laser
beam as measured in these various experiments are shown
in ﬁgure 7a. A straight line of the form γ = γ0 + αI ﬁtted
to the points for which the grating and iris system were in
place gives γ0 = 0.857 ± 0.016 s−1, α = (1.5 ± 6) × 10−3
s−1/mW mm−2. The value of γ0 is consistent with our ﬁ-
nal more accurate measurements, given in section 6 below,
while the slope is consistent with zero (and with the very
small theoretical value for de-shelving by 866 nm radiation
given above). The intercept with unﬁltered light is greater
than that given by our ﬁnal data because our method of
varying the laser intensity did not alter the unpolarized
component of the background radiation.

Spontaneous emission from the repumper laser appears
also to be likely to account for the observations of Block et
al. It is possible that it was present in previous work on
the 3D5/2 lifetime, and unaccounted for, explaining the
lower values obtained by all earlier workers. This does
not immediately apply to Block et al., however, because
their measurement involved an extrapolation to zero laser
intensity using neutral density ﬁlters.

The 866 nm laser might also generate radiation near 854
nm if it went multimode owing to a degradation of the
alignment of its own external cavity. If intermittent and
at a low level, this eﬀect could occur undetected. How-
ever, multimode operation was found in practice to have
an all-or-nothing character: if it occurred at all then it was
obvious from a large increase in the noise of the ﬂuores-
cence signals, and in such a case the data were discarded.
The grating and iris system were in place for our ﬁnal
data sets. Figure 7b shows our ﬁnal rate measurements
plotted against the intensity of the repumper laser. The
observations are consistent with the theoretical value for
the slight dependence on 866 nm intensity. Our ﬁnal result
for the lifetime was obtained with a slope ﬁxed at the
theoretical value (see section 6).

The radiation at 397 nm is obtained by frequency-
doubling and so does not contain any signiﬁcant back-
ground light. There is no transition from 3D5/2 near
enough to this wavelength to cause signiﬁcant de-shelving.
A check for this or some other (unidentiﬁed) eﬀect was
nevertheless carried out, where we changed the power of
this light by a factor 2, and we observed, to ten percent
precision, no eﬀect on the deshelving rate.

4.1.3 Thermal radiation

The rate of de-shelving is (1 − b)B12ρ(ω21), where ρ(ω)
is the energy density per unit frequency interval in the
thermal radiation, and B12 = g2π2c3A21/(g1¯hω3
21). In a
thermal cavity we obtain the rate

(1 − b)

for ¯hω21 ≫ kBT . For the 854 nm transition in a room-
temperature cavity, the rate is of order 10−18 s−1 so is
negligible. Non-negligible rates can be obtained, however,
when we consider the radiation produced by room lights or
the ﬁlament of an ion gauge. The spectral energy density
is reduced from the value in equation (4) by a geometrical
factor approximately equal to S/(4πr2) where S is the area
of the hot ﬁlament and r is its distance from the ion, if
the ion is within line of sight of the ﬁlament. For example,
taking T = 1700 K, S = 20 mm2, r = 30 cm, we obtain
a rate ∼ 5 × 10−3 s−1. In our vacuum system, although
the ion gauge is at this distance from the trapped ion, it
is not in line of sight, so we expect the rate of this process
to be well below this value.

4.1.4 Collisional eﬀects

The ion in the shelved level can undergo a collision with
an atom of the background gas. Either or both of two
processes may then occur: the ion may gain a signiﬁcant
amount of kinetic energy, and it may be transferred to an-
other state. This is a source of error since in both cases
the apparent shelving time — the interval during which
ﬂuorescence is not observed — will be aﬀected. To inves-
tigate the nature and frequency of collisional eﬀects we
monitored the ﬂuorescence from the ion for 8 hours with
the 397 nm and 866 nm radiation present but with no
laser operating at 850 nm to take the ion to the 4P3/2
level. The diﬀraction grating and aperture were in place.
During this period we observed abrupt disappearance of
the ﬂuorescence (within the resolution of the 22 ms bins)
on 17 occasions. It reappeared after times of the order of
a second, with 6 “dark periods” as short as a few tens of
milliseconds. The reappearance was generally abrupt, but
in 5 of the longer periods it was more gradual, occurring
over several bins.

One non-collisional eﬀect which can lead to loss of ﬂuo-
rescence in this test is shelving in the 3D5/2 level. Shelv-
ing caused by the 866 nm radiation exciting the 3D3/2 to
4P3/2 transition is negligible, because the spontaneous de-
cay to 3D5/2 has such a low branching ratio (the excitation
rate can be calculated from the branching ratio b and the
3D3/2 → 4P3/2 coeﬃcient A21 = 0.91 × 106 s−1 [7, 17]).
In contrast, it is not possible to rule out excitation by the
spontaneously emitted light from the 866 nm laser at 850
nm because the rate depends on the spectral distribution
of the spontaneous emission at 850 nm; if a peak happened
to be close to the frequency of the 850 nm transition the
process could be responsible for a signiﬁcant number of
the observed events. However, we would then expect an
abrupt reappearance of the ﬂuorescence on a time scale of
the order of a second, and the data then suggest that the
upper limit for events of this type is around eight. These
could alternatively be caused by ﬁne-structure changing
collisions; the ion in the 3D3/2 level can be transferred to
3D5/2 by a long range collision which may not transfer sig-
niﬁcant kinetic energy. At our working pressure of order

5

10−11 mbar we would expect about 8 such events on the
basis of an approximate value of the collisional mixing rate
which has been determined for conditions similar to ours
[20, 21]. Our observations thus provide a rough upper limit
on the background gas pressure in our system directly at
the location of the ion, to conﬁrm our ion gauge reading.
We note that the rates for D5/2 → D3/2 and D3/2 → D5/2
are approximately equal at room temperature, therefore
the present experiment does give an indication of the de-
shelving rate due to ﬁne-structure changing collisions in
our D5/2 lifetime measurements.

The other events are more obviously characteristic of
collisions. In particular, the more gradual reappearance
of the ﬂuorescence after a long dark period is likely to be
associated with the ion being cooled again after acquiring
a signiﬁcant amount of kinetic energy. On the basis of
our measured pressure and reasonable estimates of cross-
sections, we do not expect more than two or three colli-
sions of this type. Some of the very short dark periods are
likely to be much smaller perturbations by relatively dis-
tant collisions. If such a perturbation were to occur during
the lifetime measurement itself, ﬂuorescence would not be
observable for a period whatever state the ion was in after
the collision. Fortunately, for the purposes of estimating
the uncertainty in the lifetime measurement, detailed in-
terpretation of the events is not necessary. An upper limit
to the error introduced can be found by assuming that all
17 events are due to collisions, giving a rate of 6 × 10−4
s−1, and that such a collision occurring in the experimen-
tal runs themselves while the ion was in the shelved level
would have delayed (or hastened) the reappearance of ﬂu-
orescence by an average of order 1 second. The net con-
tribution to the measured rate has thus an upper limit of
±6 × 10−4 s−1 which is an order of magnitude below the
statistical error.

4.2 Systematic eﬀects in the measure-

ment process

Both the ﬂuorescence and the background signal on which
it is superposed are subject to ﬂuctuations. As well as the
random error this introduces into the measurement, be-
cause the instant at which ﬂuorescence resumes is subject
to statistical uncertainty, there are systematic eﬀects. For
example, a large ﬂuctuation in the background can sug-
gest that the ion has decayed while it is still shelved; our
data analysis procedure had to be developed and tested to
minimise errors due to such eﬀects. Further, the ion is not
cooled during the shelved period, and if there is signiﬁcant
heating the ﬂuorescence may be reduced for a time after
the decay.

periods of 10–50 ms. We ascribe this to heating. When
the d.c. electric ﬁeld in the trap is not zero, the ion ex-
periences the r.f. driving ﬁeld, which is much more noisy
than the d.c. ﬁeld, and so the ion motion heats during the
shelved periods when it is not laser cooled. We calculate
that if the ion heats up to room temperature, it would
take the lasers approximately 50 ms to cool the motion
down again and thus for the ﬂuorescence to reappear. Ev-
idence supporting this interpretation is given by the fact
that the non-abrupt reappearance of ﬂuorescence was cor-
related to the duration of the dark period, being more
likely for longer dark periods. We therefore took care to
ensure this phenomenon was not present in the runs used
for our ﬁnal data set. This was done by nulling the vertical
ﬁeld carefully before each run.

linear

In our

trap geometry the r.f. ﬁeld is 2-
dimensional. To null the vertical ﬁeld we adjusted the
voltage on one of the d.c. ﬁeld compensation electrodes,
so as to minimise the linewidth of the ion ﬂuorescence as
a function of 397 nm laser frequency (at lowered 397 nm
laser power). The 397 nm laser beam used for shelving
measurements enters along the direction (√3, 0, 1) (where
the xz plane is horizontal); this is sensitive to horizontal
micromotion and hence the vertical ﬁeld. We were able
to null this ﬁeld to ±3 V/m, and most runs were carried
out with nulling to ±10 V/m. We measured the remain-
ing heating rate, when this ﬁeld was as well compensated
as we could make it, by blocking the cooling laser beams
(397 nm and 866 nm) for long periods, and looking for
a non-abrupt return of the ﬂuorescence when the beams
were unblocked. No delay was observed (the limit of sen-
sitivity being the bin size of 22 ms) unless the cooling
lasers were blocked for more than 10 minutes, some 600
times longer than the shelving times occurring during the
measurements themselves. The consequent systematic er-
ror in the lifetime can thus be safely neglected; heating is
likely to be relatively slow when the ion is ﬁrst shelved,
but even assuming that the delay of ﬂuorescence is linear
with shelving time the error is only of order 30 µs. We
note that there were no soft edges in the runs used for our
ﬁnal data set.

We found that a horizontal ﬁeld gave a much smaller
heating eﬀect, and indeed some of our ﬁnal data points
were taken in the presence of a horizontal ﬁeld of order 200
V/m. However, for our ﬁnal experimental run, a further
beam was introduced along (0,−2,−1) to allow horizontal
ﬁeld compensation; this beam was blocked once the com-
pensation was optimised. Although not important for the
present lifetime measurements, accurate compensation is
necessary for our future work in which the ion is to be
cooled below the Doppler limit.

4.2.1 Heating during the shelved periods

4.2.2 Tests of the reliability of the data analysis

In our preliminary experiments, we found that when an
electric ﬁeld was applied in the vertical direction the ﬂu-
orescence reappeared only gradually after shelving, over

We consider three possible sources of systematic error in
the data analysis in turn. First, it is straightforward to
show analytically that approximating the continuous ex-

6

ponential distribution of dark times as a histogram causes
no systematic errors in the ﬁtted value of τ . Second, nu-
merically simulated data was used to show that varying
the threshold level used in the data analysis, did not sys-
tematically change the ﬁtted value of τ by more than 0.1
ms. Our real data has a further property: intensity ﬂuc-
tuations. The τ value deduced from a real data set was
found to vary as a function of threshold by amounts of or-
der ±0.5 ms. We estimate this may introduce a systematic
error of order 0.5 ms. Third, repeated ﬁts to numerically
simulated data sets were used to show that any systematic
error arising purely from the exponential ﬁtting procedure
was less than 0.25 ms. They also permitted us to verify the
uncertainty (one standard deviation) in the ﬁtted value of
τ , derived from the cost function surface.

These eﬀects give a total uncertainty of ±0.6 ms.

5 Demonstration of photon anti-

bunching

The quantum jump method provides a convenient means
to demonstrate photon antibunching [22], that is, genera-
tion of a light ﬁeld whose second order coherence g(2)(t)
falls below 1 as t → 0. The second-order coherence is
the normalised autocorrelation function of the intensity.
A classical deﬁnition of intensity leads to g(2)(t) < g(2)(0)
and g(2)(0) > 1, whereas a deﬁnition in terms of quantum
electric ﬁeld operators allows all values [22]. Therefore ob-
servation of a g(2)(0) value below 1 is a direct signature of
the quantum nature of the radiation ﬁeld. Quantum jump
observations yield g(2) easily, since whenever a de-shelving
jump is observed, we may deduce, with close to 100% re-
liability, that one photon at 729 nm has been emitted by
the ion [23]. Therefore we deduce the presence of a 729 nm
radiation ﬁeld which has g(2)(t) = hn(t)n(0)i /¯n2, where
n(t) and n(0) are the numbers of jumps observed in two
equal time intervals separated by a time t. This quantity
is plotted in ﬁgure 8 for a typical data set in our experi-
ment. For this study, we did not use the method described
in section 2, in which the 850 nm light was blocked when
the ion was shelved. Instead, this light was left perma-
nently on, and the ﬂuorescence monitored continuously.
We therefore obtained the well-known ‘random telegraph’
signal, ﬁgure 3b. Since we detect very close to all the
729 nm photons, we can be conﬁdent the second order co-
herence does not vary at time-scales too short for us to
detect. Therefore the antibunching signature g(2)(0) < 1
is clearly demonstrated.

We can understand the complete form of g(2)(t) by solv-
ing the rate equations for the populations of the ion’s lev-
els. All the relevant processes are fast except for two,
namely spontaneous decay from D5/2 to Λ and excitation
from Λ to D5/2, so the problem reduces to a two-level sys-
tem.
If we take t = 0 to be the centre of a short time
interval (one bin) during which a jump occurred, so that
n(0) = 1, then the probability for the atom to emit a

729 nm photon at time t is proportional to the population
of D5/2 at t, given that it was zero at t = 0. We thus
obtain

g(2)(t) = 1 − e−(R+γ)t

(5)

where R is the excitation rate, γ the decay rate. This
curve is plotted on ﬁgure 8 with no free parameters (R is
taken as the inverse of the mean duration of bright periods
in the same data set). The agreement between data and
theory is evidence that we have a good understanding of
our experimental situation.

6 Result and discussion

Our ﬁnal data set consisted of four 8-hour runs, and two
2-hour runs, all using the experimental method of section
2 (850 nm laser blocked during dark periods). The de-
shelving rates observed in these runs, as obtained by the
analysis described above, are shown in ﬁgure 7b. The size
of each error bar is equal to the statistical uncertainty
emerging from the analysis. The straight line through the
data is a single-parameter weighted least-squares ﬁt. The
line is given the theoretically expected slope, and the best
ﬁt intercept is found to be γ0 = 0.856 ± 0.004 s−1.

where τ is the natural lifetime we wish to measure, and
the γi are due to other processes which contribute to the
measured rate, chieﬂy laser excitation of transitions in the
ion and collisional processes. The eﬀect of oﬀ-resonant
excitation by 866nm radiation is already accounted for in
our ﬁtted intercept γ0. However, uncertainty (±30%) in
the light intensity at the ion makes this accounting im-
precise, leading to a further systematic error in γ0 at the
level of 0.001 s−1. This and other contributions to the
systematic error, from collisional processes and remaining
background light from the 866nm laser, are shown in Ta-
ble 1. The statistical error from the data ﬁtting dominates.
The systematic eﬀects are independent of one another, so
we add their errors in quadrature. Adding this total sys-
tematic error linearly to the statistical error, the value we
obtain for the natural lifetime of the D5/2 level is

τ = 1.168 ± 0.007 s

(7)

We have already noted the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
this result and earlier measurements. Here we compare it
with theory. Our result diﬀers from all the reported ab
initio calculations by amounts large compared with our
0.6 % experimental uncertainty. The relative diﬀerence
(τtheor. − τmeas.)/τmeas. is −10% for a recent calculation
based on the Brueckner approximation [7], +5.6% for rel-
ativistic many-body perturbation theory [4], and −2.6%
for multi-conﬁgurational Hartree Fock (MCHF) calcula-
tions [5, 6]. Of these calculations, those which produced

the smallest discrepancy with our measured D state life-
time produced the largest discrepancy with the measured
P state lifetimes obtained by Jin and Church [11]. A semi-
empirical calculation based on MCHF and core polariza-
tion [5], and a calculation using related methods [6], give
a value close to our measured result (relative diﬀerence
−0.7%). The most natural interpretation of these obser-
vations is that the ab initio calculations of τ carried out so
far have a precision of at best a few percent, and success at
calculating electric dipole matrix elements does not guar-
antee the same degree of success with other parameters
such as electric quadrupole matrix elements.

The ratio between the lifetimes of D3/2 and D5/2 is
much less sensitive to imperfections in the calculations,
and is given primarily by the frequency factor ω5, which
leads to a ratio 1.022. The factor emerging in recent calcu-
lations of the two lifetimes is 1.0335 [7], 1.0283 [4], 1.0175
[5, 6]. We take the standard deviation of these results to
indicate the theoretical uncertainty on their mean, giving
τ3/2/τ5/2 = 1.026 ± 0.007. Combining this with our mea-
surement of τ5/2 gives τ3/2 = 1.20 ± 0.01 s for the lifetime
of the 3d 2D3/2 level in 40Ca+.

7 Conclusion

We have described a new linear ion trap apparatus and its
use to measure the lifetime of the D5/2 level in 40Ca+ by
quantum jump measurements on a single trapped ion. Our
result is more precise than previous measurements, and
signiﬁcantly larger. We believe this discrepancy is mostly
explained by previously unrecognised systematic errors,
which tend to make the lifetime appear shorter than it in
fact is. Our measurement provides a new precise test of ab
initio atomic structure calculations; it is in only moderate
agreement with currently reported calculations.

We have discussed the spectral distribution of light
emitted by a semiconductor diode laser operated in an
extended cavity, emphasizing that in experiments where
unwanted excitation of allowed atomic transitions is to
be avoided, it is necessary to take into account the weak
broad component in the spectrum, which extends many

nanometres away from the main lasing wavelength. This
is signiﬁcant in many experiments in atomic physics, es-
pecially coherent atom optics, ‘dark’ optical lattices, fre-
quency standards and quantum information processing.

Finally, we have discussed various diagnostics on the
performance of the ion trap, made possible by careful
analysis of long periods of operation of the trap. These
include an upper limit for the pressure in the system, and
the heating rate in the trap. We demonstrated photon
anti-bunching, ﬁnding it in agreement with theoretical ex-
pectations.

Our uncertainty is dominated by statistics, so it would
be possible to obtain signiﬁcantly higher precision by accu-
mulating more data, though for single-ion work this would
require integration for several weeks. To go further, one
would need better knowledge of the laser intensities and
collisional processes.

one counting bin, the horizontal axis is time. The horizontal dashed lines show the threshold settings for the data
analysis. (a) Shutter method, in which 850 nm laser is blocked during dark periods. The vertical lines indicate shutter
opening and closing events. (b) Random telegraph method, in which 850 nm laser is permanently on. (a) was used
for accurate τ measurements, (b) for g(2) measurements and various systematic studies.

Figure 4: Typical data set from a single 8-hour run. The ﬁgure shows a histogram of the measured dark period durations
xi, and the ﬁtted exponential curve produced by our analysis procedure (see text). The residuals are shown on an

expanded scale, in the form (data−ﬁt)/√(ﬁt). In this example the analysis gave A = 117.7 ± 1.5, γ = 0.853 ± 0.009.

Figure 5: End view of the linear ion trap electrode arrangement, to scale, showing the a.c. trap electrodes (solid black
circles) and d.c. compenstation electrodes (grey circles). Dimensions are in mm. The position of the d.c. endcaps is
also indicated (open circle); the separation between the two opposing endcaps is 7.2 mm. The solid angle in which
ﬂuorescence is collected by the imaging system is 0.2 steradians.

Figure 7: Measured de-shelving rates. (a) Measurements using 1 to 2 hour runs of the random telegraph method,
at various 866 nm beam intensities, to test for intensity dependence of the rate. The lines are 2-parameter straight
line ﬁts to the data, with ﬁtted intercept and slope. With the diﬀraction grating and aperture in place, the slope is
consistent with zero and with the small theoretically expected value (see text). (b) Final data set using the shutter
method. Points taken at the same intensity are shown horizontally oﬀset for clarity. The error bars are the statistical
uncertainties emerging from the analysis of each run. The line is a single-parameter least-squares ﬁt; it is given the
theoretically expected slope, and the best ﬁt intercept is obtained.

Figure 8: Second-order coherence of the 729 nm radiation emitted by the ion, as deduced from quantum jump
observations. The data points give the number of times a jump was observed (therefore a 729 nm photon emitted)
at time t after a chosen jump, normalised to the mean jump rate, accumulated in several data sets. The line is the
theoretical expectation, described in the text.

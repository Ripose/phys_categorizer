(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Recently, δ-kicked particles subjected to repeating cycles of unequally spaced kicks have been
found to show quite diﬀerent behavior from the Standard Map and its quantum counterpart, the
Quantum Kicked Particle (QKP). In particular, experimental and calculated quantum localization
lengths and ‘break-times’ are strongly dependent on the initial momentum of the particles. We
investigate here the properties of the corresponding eigenstates (Floquet states) which underpin
this behavior and show they diﬀer qualitatively from those of the eigenstates of the QKP at similar
kicking strengths. We use the results to analyze recent experiments with cold cesium atoms in optical
lattices.For instance, we show that the ratchet eﬀect observed in experiments [7, 9] is associated
with asymmetrically localized eigenstates.

INTRODUCTION

Periodically kicked quantum systems, such as the δ-
kicked particle (δ-KP), which are classically chaotic, have
long played a central role in studies of quantum chaos and
the correspondence between quantum behavior and the
underlying classical dynamics [1, 2]. An experimental
realization of these systems has even been implemented
with cold cesium atoms in pulsed optical lattices. This
led to the direct observation of ‘Dynamical Localization’
(DL), the quantum suppression of classical chaotic diﬀu-
sion [3].

Consider a usual form of the KP Hamiltonian:

Consider also the eﬀect of such a Hamiltonian on
an ensemble of classical particles with initially pre-
pared with a momentum distribution, N (p, t = 0) =

gaussian centered about some average p0. The clas-
sical dynamics makes a transition to chaos for a kick

strength K >

time: < p2 >= Dt. The diﬀusion rate, to lowest order
(neglecting classical correlations) is D0 = K 2/2. Thus,
the distribution remains a gaussian, but its width in-
creases with time ∆p(t) = √Dt.
In contrast, the cor-
responding quantum system follows this behavior only
D/~2 [4]. For a system, whose

In both classical and quantum cases, the behavior is in-
dependent of p0 since, even for modest values of K > 3,
the eﬀects of small ﬂuctuations in the structure of phase-
space are on negligible scales relative to ∆pQ. Even if
there are small stable islands, they are of size ∆p
1 so
have little eﬀect on the general form of N (p), since typi-
cally ∆pQ >> 1. However, it was found previously that
perturbing the kick spacings T by a small amount results
in large scale (relative to ∆pQ) variations in the classi-
cal momentum diﬀusion: these are present even in fully
chaotic regimes (we take this to mean the absence of visi-
ble stable structures on the Poincare Surface of Section).
For the analysis of experiments, one must then consider a
local diﬀusion rate D(p0), in other words a diﬀusion rate
which depends strongly on the initial relative momentum
between the atoms and the optical lattice.

∼

Two sets of unequally δ-kicked systems with local diﬀu-
sion rates were previously investigated, both theoretically
and experimentally [6, 7, 8]. The ﬁrst is a perturbed δ-
QKP (with small deviations from period-1 kicking). The
second is a 2
δ KP, where the system was subjected
to pairs of closely spaced kicks. These two systems were
found to correspond to two distinct regimes of physical
interest.

−

The perturbed-period system was found to yield a
quantum ratchet current even in the chaotic regime (un-
expected in a Hamiltonian system) [6, 9],
if spatio-
temporal symmetries are broken. In addition, in [6] the
chaotic diﬀusive properties of the perturbed-period KP
formed the basis for a suggestion to ﬁlter cold atoms (eg
in an atom chip) according to their momenta p0. For the
δ KP, the diﬀusion was found to be dominated by
2
long-ranged correlations which control escape from trap-
ping regions in phase-space.

−

Both these systems localize in momentum space, but
with quantum momentum distributions N (p
p0) which
are not exponential and vary strongly with initial mo-
mentum p0. Note that the systems we consider here
are always time-periodic and are quite distinct from
the recent interesting study of two independent kicking

−

sequences, which can be non-periodic and hence non-
localizing [10].

Dynamical Localization is a generic eﬀect; it arises in
an extremely wide range of diﬀerent time-periodic Hamil-
tonians. In a time-periodic system, Floquet states per-
form a role equivalent to the energy-eigenstates of a con-
servative system, in determining the time-evolution of the
initial state. Provided the underlying Floquet spectrum
is made up of discrete eigenvalues (quasi-energies), the
time-evolution is quasi-periodic. In the standard QKP,
the Floquet states are exponentially localized; an initial
state expanded in a subset of these will span only the
momentum-width of these states.

−

In order to understand the chaotic quantum ratchet,
the cold atom ﬁlter and the 2
δ KP, in this work we
calculate the corresponding Floquet states and survey
their localization properties. In particular, we have in-
vestigated the variation of the localization lengths, L,
and the ’break-times’ along with average momentum ob-
tained from Floquet states, P (see section III and IV).
In Section II, we introduce both the perturbed δ KP and
the 2
δ KP systems. In Section III, we review the calcu-
lations of the Floquet states and the localization lengths.
In Section IV we present the results and in Section V, we
conclude.

As in the Standard Map, we consider a sinusoidal po-

temporal symmetries to obtain a ratchet current, we
do so by adding a ‘rocking’ linear potential of strength
A. Hence the most general form of our potential is

We must consider now how the introduction of the sec-

to the Standard Map. As stated in the introduction, for
the Standard Map, if we neglect all correlations, we have
K 2/2: this is what
a momentum diﬀusion rate, D0 ≃
one would expect if the atomic momenta undergo a ran-
dom walk. However, unless K is exceedingly large, the
Standard Map has some short-range (2-kick and 3-kick)

The case A = π/2 is particularly interesting since then
the diﬀusion is asymmetric about p0 = 0. This implies
that atoms with positive momenta will absorb energies
at diﬀerent rates from those with momenta of the same
magnitude but moving in the opposite direction. This
implies that an atomic cloud prepared initially as a gaus-
sian centered on p0 = 0 will evolve into a distribution
with non-zero momentum current, < p >

0.

∼

The asymmetric momentum diﬀusion represents a sort
of chaotic ratchet (using the simple deﬁnition of a ratchet
as a spatially periodic device which produces current
in the absence of a net bias). This type of chaotic di-
rected motion was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a kicked asymmetric
double-well potential [9] which has somewhat more com-
plicated diﬀusion behavior: the ratchet mechanism (of a
2-kick asymmetric diﬀusion correlation) is present there
too but is generally weaker (relative to the uncorrelated
diﬀusion) and less easy to investigate since the mathe-
matical form of the diﬀusion correlations is rather com-
plex. In addition, kicked asymmetric double-well systems
have not been investigated experimentally. For the above
reasons we do not consider here the asymmetric double
well ratchets of [9] but clearly, much of the analysis with
eigenstates of the current in the system where the spa-
tial symmetries are broken by the rocking term can be
extended to the asymmetric double well.

The second system we consider in this work is the 2
KP. This system has diﬀusive behavior which is qualita-
tively diﬀerent from the Standard Map and Perturbed-
period KP. While for these other kicked systems we can
analyze the diﬀusion as an uncorrelated term, K 2/2, cor-
rected by short-ranged, typically 2 or 3-kick, correlations
(for K > 3 or so), for the 2
δ KP, we ﬁnd that the dif-
−
fusion at long times is dominated by families [8] of long-
ranged ‘global’ correlations (‘global’ in the sense that
they correlate all kicks up to the time under consider-
ation). At short times, the diﬀusion is dominated by a
1-kick correlation (not present in other kick systems); at
longer times, the global diﬀusion terms, though weak,

The method of correlations provides a generic and ac-
curate way of interpreting experimental data with ce-
sium atoms for this system [8]. There is also a sim-
ple physical picture:

It was shown in [8] that these new types of ‘global’
families of correlations control the escape from, and
through, these ‘trapping’ regions. An unexpected fea-
ture of the classical calculations (and some experimental
regimes) was the observation that particles initially pre-
pared in the trapping regions will eventually gain more
energy than those initially prepared in regions of en-
hanced diﬀusion- after a timescale t >> 1/(Kǫ)2[8].

Below we describe quantum calculations intended to
improve the analysis of the experimental results for these
two systems.

III. QUANTUM CALCULATIONS AND
FLOQUET STATES

For δ-kicked systems, the quantum time evolution op-
erator for one period ˆU (Ttot) allows a fast numerical cal-
culation of the time-evolution of an initial wave-packet.
Just like in their classical analogs, we have a ’quantum
map’ that can be iterated repeatedly:

ψ(t + Ttot) = ˆU (Ttot)ψ(t)

(3.1)

There are two standard methods for implementing this
quantum map. One is a split-operator technique using
Fast-Fourier transforms.
In the other, the time evolu-
tion operator over one period ˆU (Ttot) is represented as
a matrix in a basis of plane waves

a quasi-momentum and is in the range

The results show that the current oscillates sinusoidally so
I ∝ cos 2p0ǫ for A = π/2.

But as we consider the case where the Hamiltonian
varies periodically with time, we can also describe the
system in terms of the Floquet states ΨF
n (which are the
eigenstates of ˆU (Ttot)) as follows:

where the εn are ‘quasi-energies’. The essence of this
theory is that time-periodic Hamiltonian may be solved
by methods applicable to time-independent Hamiltoni-
ans; if a quantum state Ψ(t = 0) is given at, t = 0, in
terms of an expansion over Floquet eigenstates, with co-

ˆU is a unitary matrix, so its eigenvalues are complex.
The eigenvalues of ˆU (Ttot) are obtained by diagonalising
the matrix form in the plane-wave basis. We employ a

tributions N (p

cold cesium atoms in an optical lattice pulsed with un-

from the 2-kick correction to the diﬀusion was observed
and is shown in Fig.1. In particular, a distribution cen-
tered at p0 = 0 initially, and with zero initial momentum
current < p >= 0 at t = 0, yielded a ﬁnite and constant
momentum current < p >

4 at long times.

∼

This represented the ﬁrst demonstration of a fully
chaotic Hamiltonian ratchet mechanism, due to the
asymmetric classical diﬀusion. In fact, classically, a ﬁnite
and persistent constant current is also obtained. It was
found in [9] that asymmetric diﬀusion persists only on
1/(Kǫ)2 but for this unbounded chaotic
a timescale t
system, the acquired momentum asymmetry is never lost.
For a bounded system, such asymmetries would, on a
long time-scale, be averaged out since the distribution
of a fully chaotic system would, then, eventually become
uniform. For this reason, until recently, it was argued
that a fully chaotic system could not generate directed
motion. Note that, for mixed-phase space systems pre-
viously considered in [15, 16] where regions of chaotic
diﬀusion are bounded by tori, a ratchet current gener-
ated by our asymmetric chaotic diﬀusive process would
not persist.
If there are islands, then as explained by
[15], a classical ensemble initially prepared in the chaotic
manifold cannot cross into the stable islands and a uni-
form phase-space distribution will not result. This forms
the basis of the mixed-phase space ratchet proposed in
[15], which represents a distinct mechanism for obtaining
directed motion.

So, although as shown in [9], a fully chaotic system
can keep a constant current for long times, practical im-
plementation is less feasible since the average kinetic en-
ergy of the ensemble grows without bound. This type of
chaotic ratchet is of most interest as a quantum rather
than a classical ratchet since in the quantum case, Dy-
namical Localization halts the diﬀusion and ’freezes-in’
the asymmetry, without the need for classical barriers
like tori.

≃

In Fig.2 we reproduce two experimental momentum
3 obtained with cesium atoms by
distributions for K
[13], for A =
π/2. We clearly see that the origin of the
non-zero momentum current is in the asymmetric mo-
mentum distribution. The momentum distribution is es-
sentially unchanged after about 60 kicks and the plotted
values correspond to about T = 200 kicks.

±

As expected, Fig.2 shows that changing the sign of A
reverses the asymmetry. At this stage it may be unclear
what the signiﬁcance of altering the sign of A in the ex-
periment might be, since after all, the rocking potential
involves alternating impulses K sin x
A. In fact the dis-
tinction is between the case where an impulse K sin x+A
precedes free evolution for a time interval T1 = 1 + ǫ (ob-
viously followed by an impulse K sin x
A and interval
ǫ) and the separate experimental case where
T2 = 1
−
an impulse K sin x
A precedes free evolution for a time
interval T1 = 1 + ǫ and so forth (which corresponds to a
reversed current).

the average energy are very accurately given by diﬀusion
rates (with 2 and 3-kick corrections). The essential mech-
anism is asymmetric chaotic diﬀusion: similar behavior
was found at larger K in [9] in regimes where there are
no visible classical islands (but for which experiments
are not available); hence, in the analysis of this type of
ratchet, the presence (or otherwise) of small stable is-
lands is immaterial. What is important though is that
since the asymmetric diﬀusion term 2J2(K) cos(2p0ǫ

We now examine the form of the underlying eigen-
states. In Fig.3, we compare the localization lengths for
the standard quantum KP, with those of the perturbed
period KP for K = 3.4, ǫ = 0.01. The diﬀerence is quite
striking; while the standard QKP eigenstates are quite
uniform across all regions of phase-space, the perturbed-

5

≃

period localization lengths oscillate sinusoidally with P ,
with a period of π/ǫ. Introducing the additional rocking
potential with the accelerated lattice (A = π/2) clearly
leads to a π/2 shift in the oscillations. Inspecting Fig.3(c)
for P
0, we see that for positive momenta the localiza-
tion lengths are increasing, while for negative momenta,
the localization lengths tend to a minimum. Note the
nearly regular row of states for the Standard KP case
with L
1. These correspond to states localized on a
series of stable islands separated by 2π due to the mo-
mentum periodicity of phase-space in that case.

≃

We have chosen a parameter range for which L <<
π/ǫ: the localization length of each state is much smaller
than the oscillation in P . Hence individual Floquet states
really do sample ‘local’ diﬀusion rates D(p0). We found
that if we move towards a regime where L
π/ǫ, the
conclusions remain valid, but the amplitude of the oscil-
lations is considerably damped. Similarly, if the sign of
J2(K) changes, so does the sign of the sinusoidal oscilla-
tion.

We now consider the actual form of the Floquet states.

for a set of Floquet states of the standard δ-KP are

hallmark of Dynamical Localization. It may be clearly
seen that the localization lengths vary little from state
to state.

In Fig.5, in contrast, a similar plot to Fig.4, but now
showing the Floquet states of the perturbed-period δ-KP,
shows that the localization lengths vary strongly with the
mean momentum of the state.
In addition, the ﬁgure
shows that for states localized close to P = 0, there is a
strong asymmetry. The states are considerably extended
towards positive momentum, but are strongly localized
towards negative P . This explains the form of the exper-
imental momentum distribution of cesium atoms in the
pulsed optical lattice shown in Fig.1, which for A = π/2
were also more extended towards positive P . The states

energy absorption.

FIG. 4: Floquet states for the standard KP, for K = 3.4,
~ = 1. As expected, all the states are exponentially local-
ized, giving the well-known characteristic ’triangular’ shape
of (N (P )) when plotted on a logarithmic scale. They all have
approximately similar localization lengths.

A study of the experimental and classical behavior of
the 2
δ KP was carried out in [8]. Here we investigate
the corresponding quantum eigenstates. The classical
dynamics is rather diﬀerent from the perturbed-period
KP. At very short times, the chaotic diﬀusion comprises
an uncorrelated diﬀusion term K 2/2 and one dominant
1
kick correction. It was found in [8] that one can ap-

proximate the growth in the mean energy with time t,
by the simple expression < p2 >
cos p0ǫ]. In
Fig.6(a) experimental results for cesium atoms which lo-
calized in this regime, are shown. The experiment mea-

sured the energy of a series of clouds of
moving through the pulsed optical lattice with varying
average drift momenta p0. For Fig.6(a), the simple ex-
pression given above gives an excellent ﬁt to the experi-
ment, if we take t
t∗, where t∗ is the break time. This
∼
regime corresponds to t∗ << 1/(Kǫ)2.

However, a detailed study of the classical correlations
showed that for later times, a new type of correction ap-
peared. Families of long-ranged correlations which cou-
pled all kicks appeared. These corrections are individu-
ally very weak, but accumulate to eventually dominate
the diﬀusive process. One family (termed the ’Pois-
son family’ in [8]) was shown to lead to well localized
inverted peaks in the energy absorption at values of
(2n + 1)π/ǫ, where n = 0, 1, 2.... These values of
p0 ≃
p0 correspond to trapping regions in phase-space (at low
values of K, structures corresponding to islands and bro-
ken phase-space barriers are evident. However there is no
need to investigate detailed transport through this com-
plex mixed phase-space structure: the correlations give
us a generic and quantitative handle of the energy diﬀu-
sion with time. In this intermediate regime, dominated

period KP, K = 3.4, ǫ = 0.01, A = π/2 and ~=1. Here
we plot N (P ) = |ΨF

kick correction cos 2p0ǫ − π/2. The states are narrow, but
in general, roughly symmetric. (b) states with P ∼ 0. The
typical state here is asymmetric (c) states with P ∼ +78. This
corresponds to a maximum of the 2-kick correction. States
here are generally symmetrical, but broad and ﬂat-topped.

by the ’Poisson’ correlations, atoms prepared outside the
trapping regions rapidly diﬀuse across the regions be-
tween them. Particles prepared in the trapping regions

Finally, at the longest timescales, there is the CG1 cor-
rection investigated in [8], which is a long-ranged ‘global-
correlation’ family (global in the sense that it correlates
all kicks, as opposed to a 1-kick or 2-kick correlation
which couples only neighboring kicks). CG1 results in
an oscillation of the form
cos p0ǫ and becomes domi-
−
nant at the longest timescales. The oscillation is of the
same period as the 1
kick correlation but is of oppo-
site sign. This means that at the longest timescales, the
minima in energy absorption shown in Fig.6(a) become
maxima in energy absorption; and vice-versa: the max-
ima become minima. Fig.6(c) shows experiments tending
towards this regime. The inverted peaks of the Pois-
son family are still in evidence, but a
cos p0ǫ is clearly
superposed. This is a somewhat counter-intuitive re-
sult since it implies that atoms initially prepared in the
momentum trapping regions are the ones which at long
times, for t∗ >> 1/(Kǫ)2, will absorb the most energy
(there are no further reversals of this behavior at even

FIG. 6: Experimental results for 2δ-KP realization with ce-
sium atoms (see [8] for details). Each data point (star) shows
the energy absorbed (after 100 kicks, K = 3.3, ~ = 1) by
a cloud of atoms with average momentum p = p0 (relative
to the optical lattice) at initial time, t = 0. With increas-
ing ǫ, we see the minima (maxima) in the energy ﬂip into
maxima (minima) as a long-ranged family of classical cor-
relations gradually overtakes the 1-kick classical correlation.

Hence,

there are three distinct classical diﬀusive
regimes, occurring at three timescales. The correspond-
ing quantum behavior depends on which regime predom-
inates when dynamical localization arrests the quantum
momentum diﬀusion. In Fig.7 we show plots of L(P ) for
the Floquet states corresponding to these three regimes.
In Fig.7(a), there is a clear sinusoidal oscillation of
L(P ). There are additionally some extremely narrow
eigenstates present for P ǫ = (2n + 1)π. These states

In Fig 7(b), we see a regime where, in between the
momentum-trapping regions at P
(2n + 1)π/ǫ, we ﬁnd
there is an almost constant localization length. This indi-
cates that the eigenstates are conﬁned between the clas-
sical broken phase barriers in the trapping regions. The
typical momentum distribution here is uniform, N (P )
∼
constant, in between the barriers and negligible outside
them. Early studies indicate that the NNS level statistics
are not pure Poisson in this regime as would be the case
for the standard KP.

In Fig 7(c), we see a reversal of the broad cosine mod-
ulation of Fig 7(a), similar to the reversal seen in the ex-
periment. In this regime, the eigenstates localized near
P
(2n + 1)π/ǫ are typically broader than those local-
ized in between these resonant regions.

Finally, one should discuss also the behavior of the
break-times, t∗. For these systems, we also ﬁnd that
the break time varies strongly with momentum and fol-
lows the variations of L(P ). This is not unexpected: the
break time is related to ∆, the mean-level spacing, of the
eigenstates, i.e. t∗ = 2π~
∆ . In the experiment, our typi-
cal initial momentum distribution is a Gaussian of width
σ

reported here). If the wavepacket is prepared with drift
momentum p = p0, we expect that the number of Floquet

states involved in the expansion in Eq.3.5 is N
where L(P ) is the typical localization length for states
p0. The quasienergies are

VI. CONCLUSION

We presented a study of the Floquet states of δ-kicked
particles pulsed with unequal periods. The results were

8

employed to analyze experimental data on these systems.
We conclude that the chaotic ratchet eﬀect proposed in
[9] and observed experimentally in [13] is associated with
asymmetric Floquet states localized around P = 0. We
conclude also that the behavior of the localization lengths
of the Floquet states for the 2-δ kicked rotor broadly
accompany the change over between the three distinct
classical diﬀusion regimes investigated experimentally in
[8].

A theory of matter wave interference is developed in which resonant, standing wave optical ﬁelds
interact with an ensemble of two-level atoms.
If eﬀects related to the recoil the atoms undergo
on absorbing or emitting radiation are neglected, the total atomic density is spatially uniform.
However, when recoil eﬀects are included, spatial modulation of the atomic density can occur for

times that are greater than or comparable with the inverse recoil frequency, ω
the atoms exhibit matter-wave interference that can be used as the basis of a matter wave atom
interferometer. Two speciﬁc atom ﬁeld geometries are considered. In the ﬁrst, atoms characterized
by a homogeneous velocity distribution are subjected to a single radiation pulse. The pulse excites
the atoms which then decay back to the lower state. The spatial modulation of the total atomic

to spontaneous emission; however, after a suﬃciently long time, the contribution from spontaneous
processes no longer plays a role and the Talbot periodicity is restored. In the second atom-ﬁeld
geometry, there are two pulses separated by an interval T . The atomic velocity distribution in
this case is assumed to be inhomogeneously broadened. Owing to the inhomogeneous broadening,
one ﬁnds a nonvanishing spatial modulation of the density only at speciﬁc ”echo times” following
the second pulse. In contrast to the normal Talbot-Lau eﬀect, the spatially modulated density is
not a periodic function of T, owing to spontaneous emission; however, for suﬃciently long time, the
contribution from spontaneous processes no longer plays a role and the Talbot periodicity is restored.
The structure of the spatially modulated density in the vicinity of the echo times is studied, and is
found to mirror the atomic density following the ﬁrst pulse. With a suitable choice of observation
time and ﬁeld strengths, the spatially modulated atomic density serves as an indirect probe of the
distribution of spontaneously emitted radiation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Atom interferometry has emerged as an important new research area in the past ﬁfteen years [1]. Thermal atoms
oﬀer unique properties as the working element of an interferometer, owing to their small de Broglie wavelength.
Atom interferometry has already led to impressive results in precision measurements of ¯h [2], atomic polarizability
[3], rotation rates [4,5] and the acceleration of gravity [6]. Applications to nanolithography have also been proposed
[7]. Despite the advances in atom interferometry, there remains some controversy as to what constitutes an atom
interferometer. We have discussed previously [8] the distinction between classical and quantum scattering for atom
interferometers in which microfabricated gratings are used as the ”optical” elements in the interferometer. In this
paper, we extend this discussion to atom interferometers that employ optical ﬁelds to modify the atomic state wave
function.

In our eﬀort to classify atom interferometers, it will prove useful to summarize the conclusions we reached in
analyzing the scattering of atoms by microfabricated gratings [8]. As a model system, we consider the scattering of
an atomic beam by two microfabricated gratings separated by a distance L. The internal structure of the atoms is
irrelevant here, since the atoms are in their ground state and the scattering by the gratings is assumed to be the same
for any and all ground state sublevels - there is no internal state coherence. For an angular divergence of the atomic
d/L, where d is the grating period, the atomic density is uniform in the region between the
beam, θb, satisfying θb ≫
gratings, but can exhibit ”fringes” beyond the second grating. In particular, at a distance 2L from the ﬁrst grating,
fringes having period d are produced. As such, this device has the appearance of an interferometer. Moreover, it can
be used to measure inertial eﬀects [9], since the fringes are displaced if the atoms accelerate between the interaction
zones. Further evidence that this device constitutes an interferometer is provided by a theoretical description of the
scattering in which the microfabricated gratings create coherence between transverse momentum components of the
incoming atomic beam, taken as a plane wave. Despite all these features, it is incorrect to conclude that such a system
legitimately qualiﬁes as an atom interferometer.

1

To clarify matters, it is best to back up a bit and consider the scattering of an atomic beam by a single grating. At
a distance L from the grating, the nature of the scattering is determined by the so called Talbot length [10], deﬁned
as

LT = 2d2/λdB,

where λdB = h/mu0 is the atomic de Broglie wavelength (m is the atomic mass and u0 is the longitudinal atomic
speed). For L
LT , diﬀraction eﬀects are unimportant and one is in the classical scattering limit. For a highly
LT from the microfabricated grating

≪

≪

Of course, the classical scattering limit can be obtained from a calculation in which the center-of-mass motion
is quantized. If such a fully quantum calculation is carried out, one ﬁnds that, immediately following the grating,
the atomic state wave function contains coherence between diﬀerent transverse momentum components. The atomic
state amplitude grating or matter grating created by the microfabricated grating necessarily implies the existence of
LT , this coherence is not evidence for quantum scattering since it corresponds
such coherence. However, for L
simply to the classical shadow eﬀect. The relative phase associated with the coherence associated with two transverse
momentum components, p and p + ¯hq, with ¯hq

2π¯h/d, can be written as

where t = L/u0 and ωq = ¯hq2/2m is a recoil frequency. The ﬁrst term is a Doppler shift, independent ¯h - it has a
classical origin. The second term is a recoil shift which vanishes in the limit ¯h
0. It is a purely quantum term.
Thus, for ωqt

We return now to atom interferometers which use optical ﬁelds to create atomic coherence between internal states,
external states, or both. Depending on which coherence is created and probed, one can classify such atom interferom-
eters into three general categories. Classical atom interferometers (CAI) in no way rely on quantization of the atoms’
center-of-mass motion for their operation. The CAI operate in the regimes ωqt
LT , for which quantum
scattering eﬀects can be ignored. If one restricts the use of the term ”atom interferometer” to those devices which
depend on quantization of the atoms’ center-of-mass motion for their operation, the CAI would not qualify. Examples
of CAI include those based on radio-frequency [11] or optical [12–14] Ramsey fringes.

Matter wave atom interferometers operate only in the regime ωqt >
∼

LT . We distinguish matter wave
atom interferometers in which the total atomic density is monitored from those in which an internal state coherence
or population is probed. The former we refer to simply as matter wave atom interferometers (MWAI) and the latter
as internal state matter wave atom interferometers (ISMWAI). An important feature which distinguishes MWAI from
ISMWAI is the dependence of the observed signal on the parameter ωqt or L/LT . The ISMWAI signal does not vanish
LT , but does vanish in this limit for MWAI. In other words, MWAI depend critically
in the limit ωqt
on the quantization of the atoms’ center of mass motion for their operation, whereas ISMWAI can operate in the
classical or quantum scattering limits. Although matter wave eﬀects can modify the signals in ISMWAI, many features
of the signals are determined by classical considerations, as in CAI. Examples of ISMWAI interferometers include
those which explore recoil splitting of optical Ramsey fringes in the frequency domain [15–18,2,19], and time-domain
[6,20,21].

Matter wave atom interferometers can be constructed using oﬀ-resonant standing wave optical ﬁelds. Such ﬁelds
act as phase gratings for the matter waves. Atoms enter a ﬁeld interaction region in their ground state and leave
the region with their spatial density unaﬀected. On the other hand, the phase of the ground state wave function is
spatially modulated, corresponding to a coherence between momentum states diﬀering by n¯hq (n is an integer and
4π/q is the period of the standing wave ﬁeld). As the matter wave evolves freely following the ﬁeld interaction region,
the phase modulated wave function is transformed into a spatially modulated density, which can be probed using
various techniques. Atom interferometers can be constructed using two or more ﬁeld interaction zones [22–24]. In
the transient echo experiment of Cahn et al.
[23], the vanishing of spatial modulation at the echo times t = 2T and
t = 3T (but not in the immediate vicinity of the echo times) is consistent with MWAI theory [25]. Cahn et al. also
found that the spatial modulation vanished in the classical scattering region, ωqT

1, as it must for any MWAI.

It is also possible to create MWAI by resonantly driving one-photon transitions between electronic states [25] or
two-photon Raman transitions between ground state sublevels using optical ﬁelds. The lifetime of the electronic or

ground state coherence must be greater than ω−1
, a condition that restricts one to intercombination lines in the case
of electronic state coherence. It is possible to show [25] that the sum of the spatially modulated atomic gratings
created by the ﬁelds in each of the states involved in the transition (that is, the total atomic density) vanishes in the
classical scattering limit, but is nonvanishing in the quantum scattering domain, ωqt >
1. This eﬀect has not yet been
∼
observed. If one were to probe the total atomic density rather than some internal state density in the experiments of
[16,17,19], the sought after eﬀect should be observable.

q

In this paper, we describe a new type of MWAI [26] that also uses resonant rather than oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds. Two-level
atoms pass through a standing wave, optical ﬁeld that resonantly drives a closed two-level transition in the atoms.
In contrast to the scheme described above, it is now assumed that the excited state lifetime is much less than ω−1
.
As a result of the atom-ﬁeld interaction, an excited state matter grating in the excited state is created, as is a ”hole
grating” in the ground state. If one neglects all eﬀects related to quantization of the atoms’ center-of-mass motion,
it is easy to show that, after the excited state decay back to the ground state, the ground state density is uniform.
In some sense, the excited state grating ﬁlls the ”hole” in the ground state density that had been created by the
ﬁeld. When the recoil associated with stimulated [27] and spontaneous [28,29] processes are included, however, new
features appear in the ground state density matrix. It is not possible to interpret the interaction in simple terms
as was the case for a phase grating, but the net result is that recoil leads to a nonvanishing spatially modulated
atomic density for ωqt >
LT . In analyzing the signal, it will prove useful to separate the contributions from
∼
spontaneous and stimulated processes. Immediately following the excited state decay, these two contributions cancel
one another, but as time progresses, the contribution from spontaneous processes disappears, leaving a net modulated
ground state density. When two ﬁeld interaction zones are used, echo-like phenomena can occur. It will be seen that
both stimulated and spontaneous processes contribute to the echo signals, even for pulse separations T

The paper is arranged as follows. The change in the atomic density matrix following the interaction of atoms with a
standing wave, optical ﬁeld is calculated in Sec. II. In Sec. III we consider atom interference using a single atom-ﬁeld
interaction zone and a homogeneous distribution of atomic velocities. It is seen that focussing of the atoms, similar
to that found with phase gratings, can also occur using resonant ﬁelds. The conditions under which the spatially
modulated atomic density becomes a periodic function of t (Talbot eﬀect) are established. The atomic density following
two atom-ﬁeld interaction zones is calculated for an inhomogeneously broadened transition (Talbot-Lau regime) in
Sec. IV. The results are summarized in Sec. V.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

Atom interferometers can operate in the spatial or time domain. In the spatial domain an atomic beam traverses
one or more ﬁeld regions. In the time domain, a vapor of cold atoms (or condensate) is subjected to one or more
radiation pulses. The spatial domain interferometer can be analyzed in the time domain if calculations are carried
out in the atomic rest frame. Consequently, we restrict our calculations to the time domain.

Two-level (upper state

) atoms are subjected to two radiation pulses separated by a time
i
interval T . Each radiation pulse consists of two traveling wave components having propagation vectors k1 and k2,
respectively,

= k = Ω/c, and Ω is the frequency of each ﬁeld. The total electric ﬁeld can be written as

and atom-ﬁeld detuning can be neglected during the radiation pulses, while inequality (3d) (atoms cooled below the
Doppler limit of laser cooling) guarantees that there is negligible Doppler dephasing for times of order of the excited
state lifetime. Finally condition (3e) states that we are in the quantum scattering limit.

Conditions (3) allow one to map out the time development of the density matrix resulting from each radiation pulse

in three stages:

1. an impulsive change in the density matrix produced by the atom-ﬁeld interaction

2. spontaneous decay of the excited state

3. free evolution of the density matrix.

Depending on the speciﬁc application, we calculate the atomic density matrix following the ﬁrst or second pulse.

III. ONE FIELD-INTERACTION ZONE

When an electromagnetic wave passes through an amplitude or phase grating, the diﬀraction pattern as a function
of the distance from the grating is a periodic function of the Talbot length, or, equivalently, of ωqt. Similar eﬀects
occur for matter waves and have been observed experimentally by Chapman et al [30] and Nowak et al [31]. In these
experiments, one sent ground state atoms through a microfabricated grating. When atoms are excited by resonant,
optical ﬁelds, the diﬀraction pattern is no longer strictly periodic owing to spontaneous decay. In this section we
calculate the atomic density following the interaction of a highly collimated atomic beam (quθbt
1) or a condensate
(qut
1) with a resonant optical ﬁeld. In the atomic rest frame, the ﬁeld appears as a pulse centered at T1 = 0. The
initial Wigner distribution is taken as ρgg

= W (p) [32], corresponding to Fourier components

r, p, T (−)

≪

In this equation, W (p) is the momentum distribution of the atoms.

It is convenient to orient the x, y, z axes along the mutually orthogonal vectors q, Q, and k1 ×

In eﬀect, Eq. (36) represents a periodic rephasing (Talbot eﬀect) of the ground state amplitude grating that was
created immediately following the radiation pulse, since for ωdt
1 the spontaneous contribution no longer plays a
role. One could have equally well ionized all the excited state atoms immediately following the pulse. The Fourier

components, ρgg (s, t) , and total density, ρgg (r, t) =
2π/ωq and can be used to measure recoil frequency [23,35], but, in contrast to scattering by phase gratings, there is

IV. TWO FIELD INTERACTION ZONES

In the previous section, it was assumed that any Doppler dephasing was negligible on the time scales under con-

sideration. In this section, we look at the limit in which

where u is the width of the velocity distribution in the direction of q. To be speciﬁc, we take the momentum
distribution as W (p) = W⊥(p⊥)Wq(pq),

e−p

is the distribution of momenta in the direction of q and W⊥(P⊥) is the distribution of momenta transverse to q. By
combining Eqs. (25) and (41) one ﬁnds that, following a single pulse, the Fourier components of the density are given
by

ρgg (s, t) = e−(squt)

/4J2s [θ1φTS (st) /2] ,

2

correct to order ωd/qu. This term survives only for times of order (squ)−1, which implies that the argument of the
1, θ1ωq/qu
Bessel function is of order θ1ωq/qu. This, in turn, implies that only Fourier components having s
∼
contribute signiﬁcantly for times in which Fourier components other than s = 0 are nonvanishing.

max

{

}

The picture is rather simple. The radiation pulse excites the atoms which then decay back to the ground state
giving a uniform density. For times t < (squ)−1, the sth Fourier component begins to build up signiﬁcantly provided
θ1ωq/qu > s, and a modulated atomic density appears. For times t > (qu)−1, all spatial modulation has been
washed out as a result of Doppler dephasing. Since this time is shorter than the inverse recoil frequencies, the main
features of the time dependence ρgg (s, t) found in Sec. III for homogeneous broadening never can be realized in this
inhomogeneously broadened sample.

(40)

(41)

(42)

The spatial modulation is not lost, however, and can be restored using echo techniques if a second pulse is applied
at some time T following the initial pulse. The time dependence of ρgg (s, t, T ), considered as a function of T, displays
the same features found in the previous section for ρgg (s, t) as a function of t. Speciﬁcally, it can be used as a probe
of spontaneous processes.

In this section, we consider the atomic response following two pulses centered at t = 0 and t = T
(T1 = 0 and T2 = T ). One key point to remember is that the relevant time window for which the modulation is
restored is of order (squ)−1. Thus, it is possible that the Doppler dephasing associated with spontaneous emission
no longer plays a critical role in killing oﬀ the Fourier components, since this dephasing is negligible on a time
scale (squ)−1. We shall see this to be the case; as a consequence the Fourier components at the ”echo times” have
contributions from both the stimulated and spontaneous terms, even for ωdt

period λ/ [4 sin (Θ/2)]. In this manner one can generate macroscopic atomic gratings having period λ/ [2n sin (Θ/2)].
Note that condition (47) for a nondestructive Doppler phase is a classical condition since it does not contain ¯h. The
shape of the echo signal about the echo times and the dependence of the signal on the time separation of the pulses is
determined by eﬀects related to quantum scattering, but the actual location of the signals is determined by classical
considerations only [8].

The result (52a) is the product of a term, Φ (δt) , giving the time dependence of the Fourier component in the vicinity

Comparing this expression with Eq. (42), one sees that the atomic density near the echo times mirrors the atomic
density in the time interval δt following the ﬁrst pulse. Thus the dependence of the Fourier component s = nr near
the echo time can be understood in terms of the dependence of the sth Fourier component at a time δt following the
ﬁrst pulse. In this time interval, only those Fourier components having s <

It is important to note that the recoil dephasing responsible for the ”washing out” of the spontaneous contribution
(qu)−1. The recoil dephasing
in the Talbot eﬀect plays no role here, since it is negligibly small in the time interval δt
during the spontaneous decay of the excited state does provide a small correction to Eq. (54) for δt = 0. It follows

atomic density is a periodic function of the time separation between the pulses. In contrast to the normal Talbot-Lau

We have described a new type of matter wave atom interferometer (MWAI). One or two standing wave, resonant
pulses interact with an ensemble of atoms. Atomic motion during the pulse is neglected (Raman-Nath approximation),
as is spontaneous emission. As a result of the atom-ﬁeld interactions, the total atomic density acquires a spatial
modulation that can be attributable solely to matter-wave interference - the signals arise only for times greater than
or comparable with the inverse recoil frequency ω−1
or ω−1
. Spontaneous processes destroy the periodicity of the
q
Talbot or Talbot-Lau signals. However, for suﬃciently long times, the spatially modulated atomic density becomes a
periodic function of ωqt (Talbot eﬀect) or ωqT (Talbot-Lau eﬀect).

d

To observe the Talbot eﬀect discussed in Sec. III, one can use a highly collimated (quθb ≪

ωq) atomic beam that
is sent through a ﬁeld interaction region. The ﬁelds can be pulsed, if necessary, to ensure that the interaction time is
much less than the excited state lifetime. The modulated atomic density can be monitored by scattering a probe ﬁeld
oﬀ the atoms or by directly depositing the atoms on a substrate. One might also contemplate doing this experiment
in the time domain, using a Bose condensate. The Talbot-Lau eﬀect can be observed either in the spatial domain

≫

V. SUMMARY

12

(using an atomic beam having an appropriate angular divergence) or in the time domain, using a laser cooled and
trapped vapor.

Finally, we would like to comment on the fact that the Talbot-Lau Fourier components do not vanish identically
for δt = 0 [see Eq. (55)]. The amplitude of these components is of order (ωd/Γ)2, reﬂecting the contribution of recoil
dephasing on the time scale of the excited state lifetime. Although we did not give the equation in the text, there is
also a contribution to the Talbot Fourier components of order (ωd/Γ)2 . These contributions reﬂect the ”opening” of
the closed two-level system by the recoil associated with spontaneous emission. As in the recoil-induced resonances
[36], the opening of the system is connected with quantum scattering - it vanishes in the limit that ¯h

0.

This situation diﬀers from that involving phase gratings on open, two-level transitions. Imagine that the atoms have
two ground states, g and g′, to which the excited state can decay, but that the ﬁeld drives only the g
e transition. By
using a far detuned ﬁeld, spontaneous emission to state g′ can be suppressed by a factor (Γ/∆)2. Following decay, but
for times much less than the inverse recoil time, the population density ρgg is spatially modulated to order (Γ/∆)2, as
is ρg′g′ , but the total density (ρgg + ρg′g′ ) is uniform. The opening of e
g, two-level system in this case has nothing
to do with quantum scattering eﬀects.

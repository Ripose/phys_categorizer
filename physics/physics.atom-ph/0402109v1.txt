We investigate the electronic structure and properties of atoms exposed to a magnetic quadrupole
ﬁeld. The spin-spatial as well as generalized time reversal symmetries are established and shown to
lead to a two-fold degeneracy of the electronic states in the presence of the ﬁeld. Low-lying as well
as highly excited Rydberg states are computed and analyzed for a broad regime of ﬁeld gradients.
The delicate interplay between the Coulomb and various magnetic interactions leads to complex
patterns of the spatial spin polarization of individual excited states. Electromagnetic transitions
in the quadrupole ﬁeld are studied in detail thereby providing the selection rules and in particular
the transition wavelengths and corresponding dipole strengths. The peculiar property that the
quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld induces permanent electric dipole moments of the atoms is derived and
discussed.

INTRODUCTION

External ﬁelds represent an excellent tool to inﬂuence and control the motion of quantum systems and in particular
to generate new, sometimes very surprising, properties of e.g. atoms and molecules. In the case of static homogeneous
magnetic ﬁelds the interest in the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom reached its maximum in the late 1980’s
[1]. This was motivated on the one hand by the experimental accessibility of highly excited Rydberg states via laser
spectroscopy as well as the astronomical observation of spectra from magnetic white dwarfs possessing a hydrogen-rich
atmosphere [2]. On the other hand the development of new numerical techniques allowed to address the regime where
the competition of the Coulomb and diamagnetic interaction leads to unusual and complex properties and phenomena.
Besides the vivid interest in magnetized structures the hydrogen atom served as a paradigm of a nonseparable and
nonintegrable system possessing major impact with respect to the development of several ﬁelds such as quantum
chaos, semiclassics of nonintegrable systems and nonlinear dynamics in general (see [1, 3, 4, 5] and references therein).
In contrast to the case of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld there exist no investigations on the electronic structure
and properties of atoms in inhomogeneous or trapping magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Apart from the fact that this
problem is of fundamental interest, experimental techniques allow nowadays to manufacture magnetic microtraps on
atom chips [6]. The latter consists of surface-mounted structures carrying microscopic charges and/or currents which
create a miniature landscape of inhomogeneous electric and/or magnetic ﬁelds. In particular it is possible to build
tight magnetic traps which involve magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations with large ﬁeld gradients up to
cm . Since
these traps strongly conﬁne the atoms it is to be expected that the electronic structure of excited or highly excited
Rydberg states is inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the spatially varying ﬁeld. Quadrupole magnetic ﬁelds represent a key
conﬁguration which is used in many setups of traps. We therefore investigate here the electronic structure of atoms
exposed to a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld (see also ref.[7]).

In detail we proceed as follows. In section II we present the electronic Hamiltonian of the atom in the quadrupole
ﬁeld including the interaction of the spatial as well as spin degrees of freedom with the external ﬁeld. Section
III contains a discussion of the remarkable spin-spatial symmetries of the Hamiltonian including unitary as well as
antiunitary symmetries and the related constants of motion. As a result we encounter a two-fold degeneracy of
each eigenstate. Section IV discusses the eigenstates obeying diﬀerent symmetries and the resulting consequences for
expectation values of observables. Section V brieﬂy outlines our computational approach. In section VI we present
the results of our numerical investigations establishing new spectral and other properties for low-lying and highly

excited states for weak and strong gradients. The spin expectation values and in particular the spatial distribution
of the spin polarization of the excited states are studied in detail. Electromagnetic transitions in the quadrupole ﬁeld
including dipole strengths and wavelengths are given too. Whereever appropriate a comparison with the case of a
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is performed. Finally the peculiar property of magnetic ﬁeld-induced permanent electric
dipole moments is derived and investigated in depth. Section VII contains the conclusions and outlook as well as
some discussion of relevant aspects going beyond the present investigation.

II. THE HAMILTONIAN

In ultracold atomic physics moving atoms in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds are considered to be neutral point-like
In slowly varying
particles which couple only through their total angular momentum to the external ﬁeld [6, 8].
magnetic ﬁelds it is appropriate and convenient to describe the dynamics of the atoms by means of an adiabatic
approximation, where one assumes that the magnetic moment is oriented either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld. In this way the interaction potential becomes proportional to the modulus of the magnetic ﬁeld. As long as
the spatial extent of the atom is much less than the typical variations of the ﬁeld and if one is only interested in the
center of mass motion of the atom the adiabatic approximation can be applied reliably.

In the present investigation we are interested in the electronic structure of excited atoms exposed to a quadrupole
magnetic trap or ﬁeld. Therefore we have to go beyond the above approximation in the sense that the detailed coupling
of both the electronic spatial as well as the spin degrees of freedom to the external ﬁeld is taken into account. The
majority of todays experiments on ultracold atoms deal with alkali-atoms [6]. Alkali-atoms become rapidly hydrogen-
like if their single valence electron is excited. The detailed structure of the core becomes increasingly irrelevant with
increasing degree of excitation. We therefore assume that the outer electron is exposed to the ﬁeld of a single positive
point charge. Furthermore we neglect the spin-orbit (LS) coupling and the coupling of the nuclear and electronic
3-dependence, i.e. a rapid decay with increasing r.
spin, i.e. the hyperﬁne interaction. These interactions show an r−
Thus for suﬃcient highly excited states their contributions are negligible compared to those of the Coulomb-potential
and the interaction with the external ﬁeld. Nevertheless one can discuss how the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling
might modify the properties of the system. For hydrogen in a homogeneous ﬁeld this relativistic eﬀect changes the
symmetries of the system crucially: Sz and Lz are no longer conserved separately and only Jz remains a conserved
quantity. The result is a restructuring of the energy spectrum since previously separated symmetry sub-spaces become
coupled. In particular this manifests itself in the emergence of avoided crossing [2]. For the atom in the quadrupole
ﬁeld such dramatic eﬀects are not expected since the additional LS-coupling term does not reduce the symmetry of
3-dependence, the spin-orbit interaction can certainly be treated by means
the system. Additionally, considering its r−
of perturbation theory in the regime of spatially extensive and energetically highly excited Rydberg states.

In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld the motion of the center of mass (CM) and internal (electronic) degrees of freedom
of an atom do not decouple. This holds in particular for the case of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [9, 10, 11, 12]
and therefore has also to be expected for an inhomogeneous ﬁeld. However, CM-motional eﬀects on the electronic
structure become only signiﬁcant in certain parameter and/or energetic regimes [2, 13, 14]. In order to approximately
decouple the CM and electronic dynamics we take advantage of the heavy atomic mass compared to the electron
mass (mA
me). Additionally we assume an ultracold atom whose CM motion takes place on much larger time
scales than the electron dynamics, even for highly excited electronic states. The Hamiltonian describing the electronic
motion then reads

Finally the reader should note that the coupling of the electronic spin to the quadrupole ﬁeld depends linearly on the
Cartesian coordinates. The latter prevents the factorization of the motions in the spin and spatial degrees of freedom
and renders the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation into a spinor equation. This is again in contrast to the situation
of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld where the spin component along the ﬁeld is a conserved quantity.

III. SYMMETRIES

In this section we investigate the unitary as well as the anti-unitary symmetries and conserved quantities of the
Hamiltonian (4). We will then construct the corresponding eigenfunctions respecting these symmetries. This will
help us (in Section 9) to derive properties of expectation values. Some basic deﬁnitions and features of probability
densities are also introduced being utilized later to analyze excited atomic states in the quadrupole ﬁeld.

For the following discussion it is useful to transform the Hamiltonian (4) into spherical coordinates. It reads

As a consequence of the rotational invariance of the quadrupole ﬁeld the z-component of the total angular momentum
Jz = Lz + Sz is conserved, i.e. we have [HS, Jz] = 0. Additionally we have the discrete symmetry represented by
2 -spinor, Pz is the
the unitary operator PφOPz, i.e. [Hs, PφOPz] = 0. Here O

Hamiltonian possesses two generalized anti-unitary time reversal symmetries namely T OPz and T Pφ. Both of them
involve the conventional time reversal operator T (T 2 = 1), which corresponds to complex conjugation. Applying the

two anti-unitary operators T OPz and T Pφ results in the unitary operation PφOPz. The operators T OPz, T Pφ and
PφOPz form an invariant Abelian sub-group. Together with Jz they obey the following (anti-)commutation rules:

[Jz, T Pφ] =

Apparently the spin-spatial symmetry operations form a non-Abelian symmetry group. This group generated by
PφOPz and Jz is isomorphic to C

In the following we will show, that the interplay of the above symmetries leads to a degeneracy of the eigenvalues of

In the case of an atom in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld the operators Lz, Pz as well as parity P and T σzPφ form
the corresponding set of spatial and time reversal symmetries if the ﬁeld is oriented along the z-axis. Since these
operators commute they form an Abelian symmetry group implying the well-known fact that there are no energy level
degeneracies in the homogeneous ﬁeld.

In order to ﬁnalize this section we want to remark that most of the above considerations hold not only for the case
of a ﬁxed nucleus in the trap center but also for the full two-body problem. If the dynamics of both the nucleus and
the electron is considered the conservation of T Pφ, T OPz and Jz of the two-body system holds.

to be extremely powerful and can save a lot of computational eﬀort. It is especially useful when one is interested in
computing matrix elements such as expectation values of certain observables.

V. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH

We employ the linear variational principle [16] to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian (5).
The idea is to expand the exact eigenfunctions of the Schr¨odinger equation in a complete basis set of spinor orbitals
that converge eﬃciently and accurately towards the exact solution. Calculating the expansion coeﬃcients results in
a large-scale algebraic eigenvalue equation.

Here Y m

m the energy eigenfunctions of the Schr¨odinger equation computed with this basis set are a priori eigenfunctions of
Jz.

behavior in diﬀerent parts of the spectrum. ζ possesses the dimension of an inverse length. In order to converge
eigenstates with the smallest possible number of basis functions 1/ζ has to be adapted for every energy regime such,
that it corresponds to the typical spatial extensions of the wavefunctions. For ﬁxed k and ζ the functions R(ζ,k)

form a complete functional set in r-space but are non-orthogonal leading to a non-trivial overlap-matrix. The basis
set (22) is complete in r-, θ- and spin-space.

The two oﬀ-diagonal blocks of S vanish due to the orthogonality of the spin states
. This does not hold for
H since the magnetic ﬁeld leads to a coupling of the two spinor components. With the basis set (22) all entries of
the matrices (25) can be computed analytically. To do this we have exploited recurrence identities for the spherical
harmonics and the Laguerre polynomials [17]. The matrices H and S possess a particular sparse appearance, e.g. S
is penta-diagonal, enabling us to go to large basis set dimensions.

In order to solve the above generalized eigenvalue problem we employ the Arnoldi-method [18] which is a so-called
Krylov-space method. This approach is especially suited for eigenvalue equations involving large sparse matrices. The
Arnoldi-Method is perfectly suited to provide low-lying excited states with fairly small basis sets. To calculate highly
excited states without computing the lower excited states we use the so called shift-and-invert method. Here the
1 S~c′ = λ~c′. The eigenvalues E of the original eigenvalue
σ S)−
generalized eigenvalue problem is transformed to (H
equation are connected to λ according to Ei = σ + 1
λ . Thus eigenvalues lying close to the shift σ become the
1 S. Using the Arnoldi-method these eigenvalues lying
largest eigenvalues in magnitude of the operator (H
σ S)−
in a predeﬁned energy range of the spectrum will converge ﬁrst. The shift-and-invert method allows in principle to
compute arbitrary parts of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian (5) by resetting the shift σ in successive calculations.

Thereby the basis parameter ζ has to be adapted. A good choice is ζ =

Due to the Hylleraas-Undheim theorem [19] the numerical approximate eigenvalues provide an upper bound for the
exact eigenvalues. In order to check the convergence behavior we calculate a number of eigenvalues EG1
for a given
basis set size G1. In a second step the size of the basis set is increased signiﬁcantly to G2 and the same eigenvalues
are calculated again being now denoted by EG2

regimes of the ﬁeld gradient the eﬀects of the quadrupole ﬁeld on the spatial appearance of the wavefunctions as well
as their spin properties. Furthermore we provide the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. A comparison with
properties of the atom in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is performed to illuminate the speciﬁc features in a quadrupole
ﬁeld.

VI. RESULTS

A. Spectral Properties

Depending on the gradient b of the quadrupole ﬁeld one can distinguish three regimes: the weak, the intermediate
In each of these regimes the atoms exhibits unique features. The notion of a
and the strong gradient regime.
weak/strong gradient does not refer to an absolute ﬁeld gradient but depends on the degree of excitation of the atom.
It is deﬁned to be the regime, for which the magnetic compared to the Coulomb interaction is weak/strong. For
weak gradients the level structure is dominated by the spin as well as the spatial Zeeman-term both of which depend
linearly on the ﬁeld gradient. The level degeneracies at b = 0 are lifted and a linear splitting of the n-multiplets is
observed. There is no overlap between neighboring n-multiplets which renders n an approximately good quantum

number. Figure 2a shows the linear splitting of the n = 20 multiplet for the states with quantum number m =

The levels are arranged symmetrically around the energy for zero ﬁeld. This is in contrast to the level splitting of an
atom in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld which is presented in ﬁgure 2b for the same n-multiplet. Here the Zeeman-terms
cause a linear energetical splitting into only two branches. The latter (for ﬁxed m) is the result of the two possible
spin orientations in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. In a quadrupole ﬁeld Lz and Sz are not conserved separately and
an assignment of spin orientations is therefore not possible.

With increasing gradient the diamagnetic term with its quadratic dependence on b (or B in the homogeneous ﬁeld)
becomes increasingly important thereby resulting in a non-linear behavior of the energy curves. The intra n-manifold

Although gradients b

impact on low-lying electronic states. This way some principle features of the inﬂuence of the quadrupole ﬁeld on the
electronic structure of the atom will become clear.

The splitting of the n = 3 multiplet is linear up to b = 5

The kink of the energetically highest-lying curve at b = 2

3 is the result of an avoided crossing with an energy
level from the upper n = 4 multiplet. Moving to higher gradients we encounter further avoided crossing. Crossings
between levels belonging to diﬀerent quantum numbers m are exact, since the corresponding states belong to separate
symmetry sub-spaces. The n = 2 multiplet does not show any indication of inter n-manifold mixing throughout the
whole gradient range considered here. Figure 4 shows also that the energy of the degenerate ground state depends
very weakly on the gradient b: We observe a maximum relative energy shift of about 0.04% at b = 10−

possess small expectation values of the angular momentum and vice versa. The situation is diﬀerent for b = 10−
Here a systematic decrease of the r-expectation values takes place for states with an energy corresponding to n > 30.
This is also the energy regime where the inter n-manifold mixing sets in. Here the mentioned pattern of vertical
lines dissolves and a irregular looking distribution emerges. Although the expectation values are not located between
the dashed boundaries the distribution is still widespread which can be ascribed to the diﬀerent angular momentum
distribution of the states.

We now investigate the deformation of the ground state wavefunction in both the quadrupole and the homogeneous
ﬁeld. Due to their simple nodal structure they are suited best to point out diﬀerences arising for the two diﬀerent ﬁeld

conﬁgurations. To demonstrate the deformation eﬀects on the electronic cloud we consider for reasons of illustration
an extremely high gradient. Figure 6 shows the spatial probability density of the ground state in the quadrupole ﬁeld

For the quadrupole ﬁeld we observe an asymmetric deformation with respect to the θ = π

2 -plane: the electronic
wavefunction is almost completely conﬁned to the upper half-volume (θ < π
2 ) which is a consequence of the symmetries
discussed in section III: z-parity is not conserved and eigenstates appear in pairs one being the mirror image of the
y-plane. Furthermore we observe that the electronic motion is localized
other with respect to the reﬂection at the x
particularly along the two ’channels’ for θ = 0 corresponding to the lower z-axis and θ = π
y-plane.
This property as well as the detailed shape of the electronic probability density in the individual half-volume is
determined by the diamagnetic term which is dominant in the high gradient regime. For the quadrupole ﬁeld it is
proportional to sin2 θ cos2 θ reaching its maximum value at θ = π
4 . The probability density in a homogeneous
ﬁeld (see ﬁgure 6b) exhibits the above-mentioned corresponding reﬂection symmetry due to the invariance of the
corresponding Hamiltonian with respect to z-parity. Here we observe the maximum of the probability density at
θ = π
2 and a deformation towards θ = π and θ = 0 leading to a cigar-like shape. The diamagnetic term is proportional
to sin2 θ having its maximum value at θ = π
2 thus coinciding with the regions possessing the strongest deformation
of the probability density. For both ﬁeld conﬁgurations the probability density vanishes at r = 0. The maximum
is reached at r

8 emerging from the n = 7 multiplet at b = 0. The probability density is shown for a logarithmic
scale to provide details for small values. In contrast to the constant Sz-polarization we would encounter in the absence
of a ﬁeld or a homogeneous ﬁeld we observe a complex pattern of domains exhibiting diﬀerent spin orientation (white:
spin up, black: spin down). At low r values these domains form a pattern similar to that of a chess board. With
increasing r a transition region is encountered where the formation of stripes with diﬀerent spin orientation begins.
The junctions where four spin domains meet each other coincide with the nodes of the spatial probability density. The

Coulomb interaction as well as the spin-Zeeman term are responsible for the interwoven network of island of diﬀerent
spin orientation. The additional presence of the orbital Zeeman and the diamagnetic term leads to a deformation of
this network.

Highly excited states, i.e. Rydberg states, typically possess a large spatial extension.

in the region characterized by stripes (r

changes smoothly from downwards at θ = π to upwards at θ = 0. This feature can be understood by inspecting the
spin Zeeman term only. The corresponding Hamiltonian reads

For θ = π

This is precisely the above-discussed behavior we observe at large r for the Sz-polarization of the Rydberg state
depicted in ﬁgure 9b. Apparently in this special state the electron spin prefers an antiparallel alignment to the
external ﬁeld at large radii which corresponds to W +
S . We remark that similar results on the spatial spin polarization
are obtained if one considers the quantity ~S ~B(~r) instead of Sz.

(π-transitions (ﬁgure 11)) and m = 3
2 (σ−-transitions (ﬁgure 12)). For comparison we also present the transitions
for an atom in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld indicated by dashed lines whereas transitions in the quadrupole ﬁeld
are represented as solid lines. For a detailed discussion of electromagnetic transitions in the homogeneous ﬁeld we
refer the reader to [2, 20, 21].
In order to make both results comparable we have chosen the gradient and the
magnetic ﬁeld strength such that we observe approximately equal splitting of the n-multiplets with increasing energy.

are well separated. Transitions with smaller wavelengths involve levels showing inter n-manifold mixing becoming
visible by the overlapping of neighboring groups of lines.

conserved z-parity give rise to additional selection rules and lead to a reduction of the number of allowed transitions.
In ﬁgure 12 we present the transitions to states m = 3

the change from the inter to the intra n-mixing regime is observed (ﬁgure 12a). Here the threshold wavelength at
which the overlapping of adjacent groups of lines starts is also at λ
91.5nm. Compared to the wavelengths in
the homogeneous ﬁeld we ﬁnd the transitions in the quadrupole ﬁeld to be systematically shifted towards larger

homogeneous ﬁeld each transition to a ﬁxed n-multiplet is dominated by a major line accompanied by a group of
signiﬁcantly weaker sub-lines. In contrast to this we ﬁnd many transitions of equal strength in the quadrupole ﬁeld.
This is in contrast to the above-discussed π-transitions. The total number of transitions is again much larger in the
quadrupole ﬁeld compared to the homogeneous ﬁeld.

are arranged along vertical lines, which is a result of the approximate degeneracy of the energy levels. The substates
for ﬁxed m of a given n-multiplet exhibit diﬀerent dipole momenta spreading between two (upper and lower) bounds
that depend linearly depending on n. States with a large electric dipole moment emerge from ﬁeld-free states (with
increasing b) that possess small values for the angular momentum and vice versa. With increasing gradient and degree

magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld induces a state dependent permanent electric dipole moment. This is the result of the
asymmetric form of the wavefunction in the quadrupole ﬁeld (see discussion in section VI C and ﬁgure 4). Exciting
the atom from the ground to a corresponding excited state via lasers with the corresponding transition frequency it
is therefore possible to prepare an atom with a desired permanent electric dipole moment !

VII. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have presented a detailed study of the electronic structure of atoms in a magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld. Opposite
to the common adiabatic description of the atomic center of mass motion in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds we have
focussed on the internal electronic states of the atoms exposed to the inhomogeneous ﬁeld. We have employed an
eﬀective one-particle approach including both the coupling of the electric charge and the magnetic moment (spin) to
the ﬁeld. A spinor-orbital based method to compute the eigenfunctions of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation has
been developed and applied. We have utilized a ’Sturmian’ basis set to study several thousands of excited states
for a regime of gradients of more than 10 orders of magnitude. Due to the inhomogeneity of the quadrupole ﬁeld
the spatial and spin degrees of freedom are coupled in a unique way. As a result the system is invariant under a
number of symmetry operations acting on both degrees of freedom. These are the unitary symmetries related to
the conservation of the total angular momentum Jz and the discrete operation PφOPz as well as the anti-unitary
generalized time reversal symmetries T OPz and T Pφ. These operations constitute a non-Abelian symmetry group
which leads to a two-fold degeneracy of each energy level. This is a remarkable feature in particular since it occurs in
the presence of the external ﬁeld. Without a ﬁeld such (Kramers) degeneracies of a spin- 1
2 -particle are well-known.

We have shown energy spectra up to excitation energies corresponding to principal quantum numbers of n

60.
The spectrum exhibits distinct characteristics for the weak, intermediate as well as the strong gradient regime. At
weak gradients a linear splitting of the energy levels is observed. For given m the sublevels of an n-multiplet split
symmetrically around the zero ﬁeld energy. For the homogeneous ﬁeld a splitting in only two branches is observed due
to the two energetically diﬀerent orientations of the electronic spin. Employing higher gradients adjacent n-manifold
are still separated but we encounter intra n-manifold mixing. Scaling relations for the onset of the intra- as well as
the inter n-manifold mixing in a quadrupole ﬁeld have been given. To understand some general features of the eﬀects

generated by the quadrupole ﬁeld we have studied the spectrum of low excitations in very strong (experimentally
not accessible) gradients. We have found that the ground state energy virtually stays the same up to gradients of
2 whereas the ﬁrst few excited states already experience severe changes. The latter obviously only holds
b = 10−
for hydrogen. However, one way to proceed is to investigate Rydberg states of nonhydrogenic atoms in detail. Here
especially scattering with the inner electron shell leads to modiﬁcations of the energy spectra which can be understood
by quantum defect theory [4, 25]. At least for Rydberg states which possess a large angular momentum we do not
expect signiﬁcant modiﬁcations induced by core scattering processes.

In our investigation of the electronic spin properties we found the Sz-expectation values of the electronic states to
form a regular pattern at low gradients. For higher gradients and/or higher excitations we observe a transition to an
irregular, much narrower, distribution. In order to analyze the spatial behavior of the electronic spin we introduced
the Sz-polarization. Due to the unique coupling of the spatial and spin degrees of freedom this quantity reveals a
rich nodal structure. At low radii we observe a chess-board like pattern of islands with alternating spin polarization
changing to a striped pattern at large radii. For Rydberg states the chess board pattern changes to an irregular
network of islands exhibiting opposite spin polarizations. Within the striped region an envelope behaviour of the spin
orientation on the angle θ is observed. To investigate this phenomenon we have studied a Hamiltonian describing
the coupling of the electronic spin to the magnetic ﬁeld, neglecting the spatial dynamics. Analytically calculating its
eigenstates we could reproduce the above mentioned θ-dependence of the Sz-polarization of Rydberg-states for large
radii.

We have derived selection rules for electromagnetic dipole transitions among eigenstates to the Jz as well as T OPz
operator. Linearly polarized transitions take place only between states with the same quantum number m or states
with diﬀerent T OPz symmetry. Furthermore we have calculated the amplitudes for π- and σ−-transitions emerging
from the ground states (m = 1
2 ) to levels lying in the intra and inter n-manifold mixing regime. We have compared
the results with those of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld discovering signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the line structure. Due
to additional selection rules arising from the conservation of z-parity fewer transitions are observed in a homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld. Calculating the expectation value of the dipole operator it turned out that the electric dipole moment
of the electronic states in the quadrupole ﬁeld is in general nonzero. For low degrees of excitation and low gradients
we observed an almost linear increase of the maximum dipole moment of the n-multiplets. This pattern becomes
increasingly distorted when moving to higher gradients and/or a higher degree of excitation. The non-vanishing
dipole moment is a result of the spatially asymmetric arrangement of the electronic wavefunction with respect to the

In order to achieve the experimental realization of the discussed system the so called atomchip [6] seems to be
a promising device. Here current carrying nano-structures with dimensions in the µm-regime can generate high

gradient quadrupole ﬁelds. At the moment gradients such as b = 10−
the limit. However, almost all eﬀects discussed here are not due to the diamagnetic interactions but have their
origin in the interplay between the Coulomb as well as the spin-spatial Zeeman terms. Therefore weak gradients
should not represent a principle obstacle to experimentally observe the derived properties. In particular the magnetic
ﬁeld-induced permanent electric dipole moments would potentially ﬁnd applications in e.g. quantum information
processing [26, 27, 28, 29]. Exciting the atom from the ground to a corresponding excited state via lasers with the
corresponding transition frequency it is possible to prepare an atom with a desired permanent electric dipole moment.
In order to build a working two qubit gate one is interested in ﬁnding ways to establish a controlled interaction
between two qubits to gain a phase shift. Considering a trapped Rydberg state as a qubit the interaction between
two of them can be realized via dipole-dipole interaction. This interaction could be switched on and oﬀ on demand
by changing the atomic state in the quadrupole ﬁeld.

Taking into account the ﬁnite mass of the nucleus it has been shown [10, 11, 12] that the center of mass (CM) and
electronic motion do not separate i.e. do not decouple in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. To enter
the corresponding regime where the residual coupling becomes important certain parameter values (excitation energy,
CM energy etc.) have to be addressed. A variety of intriguing phenomena due to the mixing of the electronic and
CM motion have been observed consequently. Examples are the classical diﬀusion of the CM due to its coupling to
the chaotic internal motion [13], the giant dipole states of moving atoms in magnetic ﬁelds [14] as well as the the
self-ionization process [22, 23, 24] due to energy ﬂow between the CM and electronic degrees of freedom. In the present
investigation we have ﬁxed the position of the CM of the atom at the center of the quadrupole ﬁeld i.e. we have
adopted an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus. On the other hand assuming that an experimentally prepared atom is ultracold
will certainly minimize the CM motional eﬀects. Nevertheless, a residual coupling is unavoidable and its impact on
the electronic structure is, at this point, simply unknown: A full treatment of the two-body system certainly goes
beyond the scope of the present investigation and requires both from the conceptual as well as computational point of
view major investigations. However, one should note that the symmetries discussed here equally hold for the moving
two-body system i.e. the total angular momentum is conserved and the unitary as well as antiunitary spin-spatial
symmetries, now applied to both particles, are also present.

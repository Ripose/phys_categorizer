Abstract. Application of the convergent close-coupling (CCC) method to electron-
impact ionization of the ground state of atomic hydrogen is considered at incident
energies of 15.6, 17.6, 20, 25, 27.2, 30, 54.4, 150 and 250 eV. Total through to fully
diﬀerential cross sections are presented. Following the analysis of Stelbovics [submitted
to Phys. Rev. Lett.
(http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/physics/9905020)] the equal-energy
sharing cross sections are calculated using a solely coherent combination of total-spin-
dependent ionization amplitudes, which are found to be simply a factor of two greater
than the incoherent combination suggested by Bray and Fursa [1996 Phys. Rev. A
54, 2991]. As a consequence, the CCC theory is particularly suited to the equal-
energy-sharing kinematical region, and is able to obtain convergent absolute scattering
amplitudes, fully ab initio. This is consistent with the step-function hypothesis of Bray
[1997 Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 4721], and indicates that at equal-energy-sharing the CCC
amplitudes converge to half the step size. Comparison with experiment is satisfactory
in some cases and substantial discrepancies are identiﬁed in others. The discrepancies
are generally unpredictable and some internal inconsistencies in the experimental data
are identiﬁed. Accordingly, new (e,2e) measurements are requested.

e-H ionization

1. Introduction

2

Our primary motivation in the study of electron-atom interactions is to provide
accurate data for the needs of science and industry. To this end the primary
emphasis of our study has been on discrete excitation processes. The locally developed
convergent close-coupling (CCC) method was aimed at resolving the long-standing
discrepancy of the elementary electron-impact 2P excitation in atomic hydrogen (Bray
and Stelbovics 1992). The basic idea was the same as used earlier in, for example,
pseudostate close-coupling method of van Wyngaarden and Walters (1986), except that
the generation of the pseudostates was done using an orthogonal Laguerre basis. This
allowed for a systematic study of convergence in the observable of interest (eg. 2P
excitation) with increasing number of states N. The association of the pseudostates
with an equivalent quadrature rule for the inﬁnite sum and integral over the true target
discrete and continuum spectrum indicated the importance of an eﬃcient numerical
implementation that allowed for coupling of as many states as possible for given
computational resources.

Our interest in ionization has come about rather indirectly. First we noted that
the CCC method was able to reproduce the total e-H ionization cross section (Bray
and Stelbovics 1993). This cross section was obtained by essentially summing the
cross sections for excitation of the positive-energy pseudostates, thereby identifying
excitation of these states with ionization processes. Another important indication
that the CCC method, and close-coupling approaches generally, should be able to
obtain accurate ionization cross sections was found by application to 3P excitation
of sodium (Bray 1994a). It was found that in order to be certain of obtaining accurate
scattering amplitudes, for even the sodium 3P excitation, coupling within the ionization
channels had to be treated accurately. This was a most unexpected result with the
consequence of our direct interest in ionization processes.

In recent years considerable progress has been made in the ability of theory to
reproduce fully diﬀerential measurements of atomic electron-impact ionization. There
are a number of theoretical approaches.
Some approach the problem from the
asymptotically correct three-body boundary conditions (Brauner et al 1989, Brauner
et al 1991a, Berakdar and Briggs 1994, Berakdar 1997, Chen et al 1998, Jones and
Madison 1998). Others are based on the Born approximation with the introduction
of distorting and other potentials to improve the accuracy at lower energies (Pan and
Starace 1991, Pan and Starace 1992, Jones et al 1992, Whelan et al 1993, Whelan
et al 1994, R¨oder et al 1996a). More recently, a new and very promising development
involves evaluation of ionization without reference to asymptotic boundary conditions
(McCurdy et al 1997, Baertschy et al 1999). There are also time-dependent approaches
(Ihra et al 1995, Pindzola and Schultz 1996). Another approach attempts to solve the
Schr¨odinger equation of the scattering system subject to the approximation that the
total wave function is expanded in a ﬁnite set of square-integrable target states (Curran
and Walters 1987, Curran et al 1991, Bray et al 1994). It is the latter approach that

e-H ionization

3

is of particular interest to us.
It allows for the treatment of discrete excitation and
ionization simultaneously, which to our mind is necessary to be sure of the accuracy of
either calculation.

The CCC theory has been extensively applied to e-He ionization at high (Bray and
Fursa 1996a) intermediate (R¨oder et al 1996b, R¨oder et al 1996c, Bray et al 1997, Rioual
et al 1998) and low (Bray et al 1998) energies. Most encouraging was the ability
to accurately describe both excitation and ionization 100 eV data using a single
CCC calculation (Bray and Fursa 1996b). During the course of this study some
diﬃculties relating to the accuracy of absolute diﬀerential ionization cross sections
were identiﬁed and studied systematically (R¨oder et al 1997a). It was determined that
with decreasing projectile energy the singly diﬀerential cross section (SDCS) develops
unphysical oscillations, which in turn aﬀect the magnitude of the angle-diﬀerential
ionization cross sections, though apparently not their angular distributions. The source
of this problem was suggested to be due the fact that for inﬁnite N the CCC-calculated
SDCS at any total (excess) energy E should only yield physically meaningful results on
[0, E/2] secondary energy range and zero elsewhere (Bray 1997). In other words, with
increasing N the CCC-calculated SDCS should converge to a step-function. Though this
is a conceptually useful result, as it allows unambiguous identiﬁcation of the physical
scattering amplitudes, in practice for small-enough E, ﬁnite calculations yield oscillatory
SDCS and there is small but nonzero ﬂux at secondary energies greater than E/2. It
is our view that this is a fundamental limitation of the close-coupling approach to
ionization.

Nevertheless, the utility of the approach at low energies is not as diminished as
one might at ﬁrst suspect. The reason why the angular distributions were relatively
unaﬀected, except by an overall factor obtained from the SDCS, was related to the
equivalent-quadrature idea of the pseudostates and an empirical scheme for choosing
if the true SDCS was available
the states was given (Bray 1999). Consequently,
ionization cross sections by the ratio of
then rescaling all of the angle-diﬀerential
the true to the CCC-calculated SDCS would result in relatively accurate magnitudes
also. This idea has been applied successfully to helium, where rescaling factors of
approximately two were identiﬁed and brought about good agreement with experiment
(Bray et al 1998, Rioual et al 1998). Not so in the case of ionization of atomic hydrogen
by 15.6 eV electrons (Bray 1999), where the estimated rescaling by 2.7 still left the
theory a factor of two or so less than experiment.

To complicate things further Bencze and Chandler (1999) have questioned the
validity of the CCC approach to ionization at any energy. They claim that the CCC-
calculated ionization scattering amplitudes as deﬁned by Bray and Fursa (1996a) should
satisfy the symmetrization postulate

fS(k, q) = (−1)SfS(q, k)

(1)

for e-H ionization, where S is the total spin. The fact that they don’t (CCC-calculated
SDCS is not symmetric about E/2) they take to indicate a lack of convergence

e-H ionization

(2)

everywhere, and presumably, agreement with experiment is coincidental.

Another criticism of our work relates to the incoherent combination of CCC-
calculated amplitudes on either side of E/2. Whereas this choice was taken in order to
retain the unitarity of the close-coupling formalism Stelbovics (1999) showed that this
was not necessary. By studing the S-wave model he showed that the CCC-calulated
ionization amplitude was able to be clearly deﬁned only for k = q and the cross section
should be given by

where the f (N )
are the amplitudes calculated in the CCC theory. Stelbovics (1999) also
concluded that apparent convergence of the CCC results at E/2 was real and that it
was to half the true scattering amplitude, or one quarter the true cross section. The
consequence of his work is profound.
It suggests that the CCC method is ideal for
equal-energy-sharing kinematics where it is able to yield convergent cross sections in
both shape and magnitude fully ab initio without any reference to rescaling.

(3)

To address these issues we perform a systematic study of e-H ionization from high
energies through to low. We give our best estimates for the total through to fully
diﬀerential ionization cross sections and discuss the issues involved.

2. Theory

The details of the CCC theory have already been given (Bray and Fursa 1996a). Here
we outline some of the major issues of interest. We begin with the standard Born
approximation because it is accurate at high energies and the objections raised by Bencze
and Chandler (1999) are equally applicable to our interpretation of this approximation.
Unless speciﬁed otherwise atomic units are assumed throughout.

2.1. The Born approximation

If one needs a quick approximate estimate of an excitation scattering process then the
Born approximation is an excellent candidate as it covers an immense energy range. The
total Hamiltonian H is partioned asymmetrically H = K +V , where K = K1 +H2 is the
asymptotic Hamiltonian, and where K1 is the free projectile kinetic energy operator and
H2 = K2 + V2 is the hydrogen target Hamiltonian. The projectile(target) potential is
V1(V2), and V = V1 + V12 is the asymptotic potential, where V12 is the electron-electron
potential.

The diﬀerential cross section for excitation of the hydrogen ground state φi to state

φf by an electron of incident momentum ki is approximated via

where the channel states satisfy

K|φn(2)kn(1)i = (ǫn + k2

n/2)|φn(2)kn(1)i.

In the Born approximation the total wavefunction is simply written as

|Ψ(+)

Si i ≈ |φikii,

which neglects antisymmetry (has no dependence on total spin S) or coupling to other
channels.

The Born approximation may also be readily applied to ionizing collisions, for
i /2 > 0, by simply replacing the discrete eigenstate φf in
, a Coulomb wave of momentum qf and energy
f /2. Then the triply (fully) diﬀerential cross section (TDCS) may be

total energy E = ǫi + k2
(4) with a continuum eigenstate q(−)
q2
f /2 = E − k2
written as

f

d3σ
dΩ1dΩ2dE2

≈ |hkf q(−)

f

|V |φikii|2,

Immediately we run into a problem. In the case of ionization we have two electrons going
out with momenta kf and qf , typically one much faster than the other. Which one do
we assign to the plane wave (electron one) and which to the Coulomb wave (electron
two)? Numerical investigation shows that the slower electron should be treated as a
Coulomb wave and the faster as a plane wave. This is often justiﬁed as a shielding
approximation: the fast electron is shielded from the proton by the slow electron, which
in turn moves in the potential of the proton. While this seems very sensible we ﬁnd
it somewhat a mixture of ideas given that the time-independent formalism is being
used. Instead, we suggest that a more consistent approach is to state that there are two
theoretically distinguishable Born approximations to any ionization process which must
be combined incoherently

dΩ1dΩ2dE2

≈ |hkf q(−)

f

|V |φikii|2 + |hqf ′k(−)
f ′

|V |φikii|2.

(8)

Here the plane wave hqf ′| has momentum qf ′ = qf and Coulomb wave hk(−)
| has
f ′
momentum kf ′ = kf . We use the f ′ index to ensure clear distinguishability between
the two cases.

f /2 ≪ k2

Without loss of generality let us suppose that qf ≤ kf . For q2

f /2 there
is no diﬀerence between (7) and (8) since the ﬁrst term in (8) is typically an order of
magnitude or more bigger than the second. Though the Born approximation works well
for such cases, we may wish to apply it at low energies to say demonstrate the diﬀerence
between the Born approximation and a more realistic theory. In this case the two terms
may be of similar magnitude, and we feel that (8) is a more consistent interpretation of
the Born approximation utilizing solely the rules of non-stationary Quantum Mechanics.
The primary advantage of the formulation (8) is that of clarity. For example, how
should the total ionization cross section be deﬁned following the deﬁnition (7)? Should
the endpoint of the energy integration (dE2) be E/2 or E? This question is worthwhile
addressing even if in practice the energy integral typically converges well before E/2.

e-H ionization

From our perspective, for the Born approximation (7) (no antisymmetry, electrons are
distinguishable) the endpoint of the integration to form the total ionization cross section
σI should be E, i.e.

where E2 = q2

we suggest that as the diﬀerence in the energies of the two outgoing electrons increases
the ﬁrst term in (8) and (11) converges to the true scattering amplitude, whereas the
second converges to zero.

The objections of Bencze and Chandler (1999) are applicable to our interpretation
of the Born approximation. The symmetrization postulate (1) is not satisﬁed as there
is no spin-dependence. The two terms are combined without any normalization factors,
since any such factor would aﬀect the ﬁrst, most dominant term. Nevertheless, the Born
approximation has value over an immense kinematical range.

2.2. The close-coupling with no exchange approximation

To improve on the Born approximation we need to allow for coupling to other channels
and antisymmetry of the total wave function. We consider the former ﬁrst. Improvement
on (6) is provided by the approximation

The diagonalization (15) results in states with negative and positive energies. With
increasing N the negative energy states φ(N )
f → φf , the true discrete eigenstates, and
the positive energy states provide an increasingly dense discretization of the continuum.
The close-coupling approximation (without exchange) builds on top of the Born
approximation and so has the same asymptotic Hamiltonian and channel functions. It
is unitary and the sum over n implies an on-shell integration over the continuum from
zero to total energy E. The transition matrix is

This is a generalization of (8). With such a deﬁnition the SDCS is symmetric about
E/2 and the total ionization cross section would be obtained by integration to E/2.
It is helpful to think of the second term in (13) as a second order correction to the
Born approximation. As such,
it vanishes at high energies leaving just the Born
approximation for both the discrete excitation and ionizing collisions. Numerically,

For unequal energy-sharing the two terms in (18) are very diﬀerent and converge
to their respective Born approximations with increasing energy. In this case the ﬁrst
term converges to the true scattering amplitude while the second converges to zero.

Note that for equal energy-sharing f = f ′, but the two terms are still generally
diﬀerent owing to the vector nature of momenta. They are equal to each other for the
so-called coplanar doubly symmetric (EA = EB and θA = −θB) geometry. However,
while exchange is neglected this approximation will not work well for this special case,
and has only value whenever the SDCS at E/2 is very much smaller than for the highly
asymmetric energy-sharing.

2.3. The close-coupling with exchange approximation

In the momentum-space formulated close-coupling equations (13) introduction of
exchange results in a simple modiﬁcation of the interaction potential V by VS = V +
(−1)S(H − E)Pr, where Pr is the space exchange operator (Bray and Stelbovics 1992).
We then solve

Thus, the total wave function is antisymmetric in all space of the two electrons, but is
zero when both r1 and r2 are large.

The change from V to VS is not entirely trivial. There are extra computational
diﬃculties due to non-uniqueness problems, but these have been dealt with adequately,
see Bray and Stelbovics (1992) for details.

With increasing total energy E the contribution of the exchange part of VS
diminishes faster than the direct part V . Eventually we may totally drop exchange
to obtain (13), and with further increase of energy obtain the Born approximation.

generally. Note that though qf ′ = qf and kf ′ = kf the two states φ(N )
are
very diﬀerent for f 6= f ′. Bencze and Chandler (1999) claim that in the limit of inﬁnite
N there should be equality in (23), and hence double counting of the ionization cross
sections. While we are unable to perform such calculations, the fact that the two terms
converge to their respective Born estimates with increasing energy indicates that their
derivation is in error. The source of the error we suspect to be in the way the limit
N → ∞ is taken ignoring how this aﬀects the close-coupling boundary conditions. What
we do observe, with increasing N, is that the close-coupling with exchange calculations
f ′/2 < ǫ(N )
yield diminishing cross sections for amplitudes hqf ′φ(N )
.

This has led to the suggestion that the CCC calculations should converge to a step-
function SDCS (Bray 1997), with numerical problems arising whenever the size of the
step at E/2 is substantial. This idea has gained further support from Miyashita et al
(1999) and Baertschy et al (1999) who studied the e-H S-wave model. Unfortunately, a
mathematical proof is still lacking.

2.4. Equal energy-sharing kinematics

Most recently Stelbovics (1999) has made substantial progress in the understanding
of the problem. By also studying the S-wave model he deduced that at equal-energy-
sharing the true ionization amplitudes fS(k, q) may be deduced from those obtained in
the close-coupling theory f (N )

fS(k, q) = f (N )

Consequently, he concluded that the CCC-calculated k = q amplitudes did converge
with increasing N, but to half the true scattering amplitude, at least in the considered
model. The cross sections are obtained from |fS(k, q)|2 as opposed to the integral
preserving estimate we suggested |f (N )
(q, k)|2. Can the two prescriptions
be reconciled?

(k, q)|2 + |f (N )

S

S

Firstly, given the observation of Stelbovics (1999) that the CCC amplitudes
converge to half the true amplitudes for the model problem we suppose this is also
the case for the full problem and so our prescription yields cross sections a factor of two
too low in all equal-energy-sharing cases. This has been previously observed in the case
of e-He ionization at 64.6 eV (Bray et al 1997), 44.6 eV (Rioual et al 1998) and 32.6 eV
(Bray et al 1998). Thus, only for equal-energy-sharing we should have an extra factor
of two multiplying the incoherent combination of the f (N )
. Being only at a single point
this doesn’t aﬀect the integral that leads to the correct total ionization cross section.

Now, we have noted earlier (Bray et al 1997) that the two terms |f (N )
(k, q)|2 and
(q, k)|2 are substantially diﬀerent and are necessary together to yield accurate

where J is total orbital angular momentum, ǫ(N )
f l = q2/2 and σl(q) is the full complex
phase arising from the overlap hq(−)
f l i. Given that k = q interchange of l and L has
the eﬀect of explicitly changing the phase as well as the T -matrix obtained from (19).
Yet together, the resulting amplitudes satisfy (25). Furthermore, since l ≤ lmax with
|J − l| ≤ L ≤ J + l, we need suﬃciently large lmax that interchange of L and l was
possible for all substantial TJS. To demonstrate (26) graphically, in all of the following
ﬁgures that present equal-energy-sharing kinematics we give both sides of (26) for the
two spins.

One may ask which of the two sides of (26) is more accurate. Unfortunately, even
equality does not guarantee accuracy of the ampltudes, only correct symmetry. In other
words, satisfaction of (26) is necessary but not suﬃcient. The right side of (26) has the
advantage of looking compatible with indistinguishable treament of the two electrons,
and so being able to readily deﬁne the ﬁnal amplitude to be used in generating the
cross sections, which will always have the correct symmetry irrespective of what the
underlying CCC amplitude is. This is a strength and a weakness, as it looses sensitivity
to the accuracy of the CCC calculation. The left side of (26) is more sensitive, since for
example, for the doubly symmetric geometry both terms must yield zero for the triplet
case. The right side has the advantage of not requiring the step-function idea or the
combination of amplitudes at E/2 as a limiting procedure of amplitudes on either side
of E/2. The most sensitive test would be to simply use 2f (N )
(q, k) as
the amplitudes. The factor of two is due to the convergence to half the true magnitude
at E/2.

We should mention that the demonstration of failure of a coherent combination of
amplitudes for e-He ionization (Bray et al 1997) was due to the fact that in the case
of helium the correct coherent combination is very complicated and at this point still
not worked out. The one given, f (N )(k, q) + f (N )(q, k), is too simplistic and yields the
wrong answer.

2.5. Asymmetric energy-sharing kinematics

Stelbovics (1999) shows that diﬀerent
What about asymmetric energy-sharing?
logarithmic phases on either side of E/2 lead to diﬃculty in deﬁning the ionization
amplitudes, unless the CCC-calculated amplitude for q > k was identically zero. Though
we are as yet unable to prove analytically the step-function hypothesis, which Bencze
and Chandler (1999) believe to have proved to be incorrect, all of our numerical evidence
is consistent with it. Certainly, for the purpose of making comparison with experiment,
it holds in our ﬁnite calculations for the substantially asymmetric excess energy-sharing
kinematics. In these cases the second term in (20) is insigniﬁcant compared to the ﬁrst.
Does the ﬁrst term yield the true scattering amplitude? When convergent, as it is at
high energies (Bray and Fursa 1996a), we suspect so. This is also implied by the analysis
of Stelbovics (1999). At suﬃciently low energies we ﬁnd that convergence to a desirable
accuracy is unable to be obtained for the SDCS with q < k. Our choices are then to
present results as they are, or attempt to estimate what the true SDCS should be and
rescale the CCC-calculated TDCS to this SDCS.

How can we estimate what the true SDCS might be? Fortunately, the underlying
physics suggests that the functional form of the SDCS is likely to be simple and, at
suﬃciently low energies, may be modeled relatively accurately by a quadratic. We
already know the integral accurately ab initio, and the point of symmetry, requiring
just one more pramater to ﬁx the quadratic. To do so Bray et al (1998) have observed
that the value of the e-He SDCS at zero secondary energy was quite stable and used
this to ﬁx the estimate of the true SDCS. The resultant rescaling lead to a factor of
approximately two increase in the CCC-calculated TDCS at equal-energy-sharing, and
good agreement with absolute experiment. A similar idea was used for the e-H system
at 15.6 eV (Bray 1999), resulting in a factor of 2.7 increase, still a further factor of two
below experimental absolute value determination.

The oscillations in the CCC-calculated SDCS have been well-documented, and we
have been unable to explain, until now, apparent convergence of the CCC results
at equal-energy-sharing (Bray et al 1997, R¨oder et al 1997a, Bray 1997, Rioual
et al 1998, Bray 1999). Now, thanks to the analysis of Stelbovics (1999), we know
the value of the true SDCS at E/2. This SDCS, calculated according to (9) or (10), is
a factor of four or two lower than the true SDCS, respectively. This has been tested by
comparison with the benchmark SDCS calculations of Baertschy et al (1999) as reported
by Stelbovics (1999).

Another strong test of this idea is found by consideration of double photoionization
(DPI). Here the CCC method has yielded accurate total (Kheifets and Bray 1998b) and
diﬀerential (Kheifets and Bray 1998a, Br¨auning et al 1998) ionization cross sections.
The rescaling of the CCC TDCS relied on the work of Pont and Shakeshaft (1995)
who gave demonstrably accurate estimates of the total cross sections, and arguably
equally accurate estimates of the SDCS(E/2), from 2 to 80 eV above threshold. This
is particularly helpful for us as it allows a thorough comparison of the CCC-calculated

e-H ionization

12

SDCS(E/2). We have performed this check for the published CCC-calculated DPI
SDCS, and at the excess energies presented here, and ﬁnd a factor of two diﬀerence,
generally to within 5%.

Accordingly, rather than assuming a stable SDCS(0) derived from examination of
near threshold total ionization cross sections, we ﬁx the third parameter of the quadratic
estimate of the SDCS by the estimate of the true SDCS(E/2) obtained from the raw
CCC-calculated SDCS(E/2) multiplied by four, i.e the same value as obtained from
either side of (26). This is particularly helpful in the present e-H ionization case, where
the close-coupling equations are solved separately for the two total spins. For each total
spin rather than attempting to estimate SDCS(0) we simply obtain SDCS(E/2) directly
from the CCC calculations, and hence the quadratic SDCS estimate.

3. Results and Discussion

Before looking at the detailed results of the individual energies considered, we present
in ﬁgure 1 the total ionization cross section (TICS) and its spin asymmetry as a
function of energy. The CCC calculations at the individual energies (solid dots) will
be detailed later. We see excellent agreement between the CCC calculations and the
experiment, with the exception of the data of Shyn (1992). The experimental technique
of Shah et al (1987) is speciﬁcally aimed at the total ionization cross section, whereas
Shyn (1992) obtained it after a double integration of doubly diﬀerential cross section
(DDCS) measurements. Good agreement with the spin asymmetries indicates correct
spin-dependent total ionization cross sections at all energies. The quality of agreement
between theory and experiment was ﬁrst presented by Bray and Stelbovics (1993). Since
that time other close-coupling methods have also obtained similar results (Kato and
Watanabe 1995, Bartschat and Bray 1996, Scott et al 1997).

P

The utility of the CCC calculations depends on obtaining convergence with
l Nl. This means convergence with target-space angular momentum
increasing N =
lmax and number of states Nl within each l. We take Nl = N0 − l as this leads to
a similar integration rule in the continuum for each l, of importance at low energies
(Bray 1999). This allows convenient labeling of the calculations by CCC(N0, lmax). All
of the calculations performed required substantial computational resources. The higher
energy calculations required around 1G of RAM, while the lower energy ones required
up to 2G of RAM.

At high enough energies most theories, those that satisfy the symmetrization
postulate, and those that don’t, yield much the same results for highly asymmetric
energy-sharing kinematics. We wish to demonstrate that the CCC diﬀerential cross
sections as deﬁned in (20) and (18) also do so.

3.1. Incident electron energy 250 eV

We begin our study with E0=250 eV. In performing the calculations we need to be
mindful of which experiment we wish to describe. The experiment of Ehrhardt et al
(1986) has EB=5 eV, and so we ensure, by varying the Laguerre exponential fall-oﬀ
parameter λl (Bray and Stelbovics 1992), that one of the states φ(N )
nl had the energy
ǫ(N )
nl =5 eV. A number of CCC(N0, lmax) calculations were performed, but we present the
results from only the biggest, CCC(15,5), which couples a total of 75 states.

The energy levels of the CCC(15,5) calculation are given in ﬁgure 2. We see that
the choice of states has lead to a systematic treatment of both the discrete and the
continuous spectrum. Negative-energy states with n ≤ 6 have arisen. The n ≤ 5
are good eigenstates, with the n = 6 states taking into account all true n ≥ 6
discrete eigenstates. The positive energies are approximately similarly spaced for each
l, particularly in the region of 5 eV. The total energy E = 250 − 13.6 eV is greater than
all of the state energies, and hence all channels are open. The energy levels increase

approximately exponentially, and so the energy region [0, E/2] is much more densely
covered than [E/2, E].

In ﬁgure 3, we consider the SDCS arising from the CCC(15,5) calculation. This
we obtain directly from the integrated cross sections for the excitation of the positive-
energy pseudostates (Bray and Fursa 1995), equivalent to (9). Comparison with the
data of Shyn (1992) is given after the latter have been reduced by a factor of 0.7.
This reduction brings the experimental SDCS into consistency with the data of Shah
et al (1987). There is almost no diﬀerence between the Born approximation and the
CCC(15,5) result. Both yield excellent agreement with the rescaled experiment, though
neither are symmetric about E/2 and hence do not satisfy the symmetrization postulate
(1). The theoretical SDCS at E/2 is practically zero and remains so at higher secondary
energies. The true, experimentally measurable SDCS, would be symmetric about E/2,
but there is no new physics in this and does not invalidate the Born or CCC results for
the smaller secondary energies.

The DDCS are given in ﬁgure 4. Unscaled data are compared with the CCC and
Born calculations. We see good agreement at the backward angles suggesting that
the experiment had some systematic problem at the lower scattering angles. There is
a little diﬀerence between the Born and CCC calculations, but generally the two are

very similar. We also performed a CCC(15,5) calculation with no exchange. This is
indistinguishable from the presented CCC(15,5) one, indicating that the diﬀerence with
Born is due solely to coupling.

Lastly, for this incident energy, the TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 5. We see small
diﬀerence between the Born and the CCC calculation, with the latter giving complete
agreement with experiment. Comparison with the CCC(15,5) no exchange calculation,
which is pictorially indistinguishable from the presented CCC(15,5) one, indicates that
the improvement on the Born approximation is again solely due to coupling.

In our view, the results presented at this energy are suﬃcient to invalidate the
arguments of Bencze and Chandler (1999). Here the close-coupling formalism yields
results much the same as the Born approximation and experiment. This is not fortuitous.
The second term in (20) is essentially zero, with the ﬁrst term, in our view, having
converged to the true ionization scattering amplitudes of the problem considered.

opposite side of the incident beam to the positive angles.

3.2. Incident electron energy 150 eV

We have considered e-H ionization at 150 eV in the very ﬁrst application of the CCC
method to diﬀerential ionization cross sections (Bray et al 1994). The formalism used
then varies a little from the present in that following Curran and Walters (1987) an
attempt was previously made to incorporate the treatment of higher target-space orbital
angular momentum than the lmax used within the close-coupling equations. We no longer
do so, believing that it is more consistent to extract all of the ionization information
from only the matrix elements arising upon the solution of the close-coupling equations.
At this energy we have absolute experimental TDCS for three secondary energies
EB=3, 5 and 10 eV (Ehrhardt et al 1986).
In a single calculation we may vary λl
to obtain only one of the EB. The TDCS at other EB have to be obtained with the
assistance of interpolation (Bray and Fursa 1996a). Three CCC(15,5) calculations were
performed with λl varied to obtain each of the three EB. Comparison of the full set
of TDCS showed little variation and so we present the results just from the calculation
where the λl were varied to obtain EB = 5 eV. The energy levels of this CCC(15,5)
calculation are given in ﬁgure 6. We see that the choice of states is very similar to the
case of 250 eV incident energy (ﬁgure 2). The total energy E = 150 − 13.6 eV is greater
than all but one of the state energies.

In ﬁgure 7 the SDCS arising from the calculation is considered. Comparison with
the data of Shyn (1992) is given after the latter have been reduced by again a factor
of 0.7. There is now some visible diﬀerence between the Born approximation and the
CCC(15,5) result. Again, no exchange calculations show that this is due to neglect
of coupling in the Born approximation. Both yield good agreement with the rescaled
experiment. The SDCS(E/2) is practically zero and hence, we suspect, there are no

The DDCS are given in ﬁgure 8. Unscaled data of Shyn (1992) is compared with the
CCC and Born calculations. As one might expect the diﬀerence between Born and CCC
is somewhat bigger at this energy than at 250 eV. The smaller visible diﬀerence in the
SDCS is due to the “crossing-over” of the two curves. The agreement with experiment
is only acceptable at intermediate and backward angles. The fact that these data lead
to only a 30% lower TICS than the Shah et al (1987) data is due to the sin(θ) term in
the integration of the DDCS to obtain the SDCS.

The TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 9. The diﬀerence between the Born and the
CCC calculation is quite substantial. Comparison with the CCC(15,5) no exchange
calculation indicates that the diﬀerence with the Born approximation is primarily due
to coupling. The agreement with experiment is somewhat mixed. The fact that the

Born approximation is too high and sometimes the CCC result too low indicates that
a calculation which combines the two ideas, like a distorted-wave Born approximation
(DWBA), may occasionally yield a better agreement with experiment than the presented
CCC calculations, see Bray et al (1994) for some comparison with other theory. However,
we suppose that the present calculations should be the most accurate.

3.3. Incident electron energy 54.4 eV

This energy was also considered in the very ﬁrst application of the CCC method to
diﬀerential ionization cross sections (Bray et al 1994). However, as described in the
previous subsection the formalism is now a little diﬀerent, and also some new interesting
issues have since emerged.

At 54.4 eV incident electron energy absolute experimental TDCS for EB = 5 eV
exist for four angles of the fast electron (R¨oder et al 1996a). We again apply a CCC(15,5)

approximation at this energy. The energy levels of this calculation are given in ﬁgure 10.
The energy distribution is much the same as at 250 and 150 eV. The total energy
E = 54.4 − 13.6 eV is such that there is a “closed” state for each l (two for S-states).
Bray and Clare (1997) discussed, by reference to the equivalent quadrature idea, the
importance of having the total energy bisect two of the pseudothresholds. This is
particularly important for small N0 and E. Unfortunately we are unable to have both
an energy level at 5 eV and ensure that E is inbetween two other energy levels. In the
present case this is not a major issue as we shall see that the SDCS is very small at the
larger secondary energies.

In ﬁgure 11 the SDCS arising from the calculation is considered with comparison of
the available rescaled 60 eV data of Shyn (1992). At this energy the Born approximation
is much too high and we shall not consider it again. Instead, we shall concentrate on
the importance of the two spin (S = 0, 1) channels. These are presented with the spin
weights included so the spin-averaged sum is simply the sum of the singlet and triplet
components.

Comparison with experiment is generally good, but looking at the individual
spin components suggests the existence of a numerical problem. Whereas the triplet
component is very smooth, the singlet one shows minor unphysical oscillation. It is our

opinion that this is due to the fact the singlet SDCS at E/2 = 20.4 eV is substantially
bigger than the triplet one, which is near zero.
If, as we suppose, the step-function
hypothesis (Bray 1997) is true, then the size of the step should be relatively bigger for
the singlet case. A ﬁnite discretization of such a step function may be the cause of the
oscillation. As a consequence, there is some uncertainty in the magnitudes of the singlet
contribution at 5 eV. We could attempt to rescale SDCS. However, at this energy we
did not ensure an energy point at E/2 for each l, see ﬁgure 10. Hence the magnitude of
the SDCS(E/2) may signiﬁcantly depend on the choice of interpolation.

The DDCS are given in ﬁgure 12. Unscaled data of Shyn (1992) are compared
with the CCC calculations. Also given are the singlet and triplet components. The
agreement with experiment is good at intermediate and backward angles, but the

systematic problem at forward angles continues.

The TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 13. For clarity of presentation we do not compare
with the multitude of other available theories here. Considerable comparison of other
theories with experiment may be found in Bray et al (1994), R¨oder et al (1996a) and
Jones et al (1997). The agreement with experiment is a little disturbing for small θA,
but improves rapidly with increasing θA. Perhaps a more accurate theoretical estimate
may be obtained by marginally increasing the singlet component (systematically for all
θA), according to the discussion relating to the SDCS. Looking at the data it is diﬃcult
to argue for or against this case. What is clear is that due to the inherent diﬃculties
of the CCC formalism e-H ionization and e-He ionization have diﬀerent problems in
terms of comparison with experiment. In the e-He case there is only one value of spin,
here we have two, but experiment only measures their sum. These issues become more
transparent at lower energies with equal energy-sharing kinematics.

3.4. Incident electron energy 30 eV

At 30 eV incident energy relative equal energy-sharing (EB = EA = 8.2 eV) data exists
for the coplanar ﬁxed θAB geometries (R¨oder et al 1996a) and the coplanar symmetric
geometry (Whelan et al 1994). As the incident energy and hence E is reduced we
need to take more care that E is nearly inbetween two of the pseudothresholds so that

the integration rule associated with the open pseudostates ended near E. This issue
is alleviated by having a larger N0 as then the size of the SDCS at larger secondary
energies is further reduced. For these reasons here we present the results of a CCC(18,5)
calculation. The energy levels of this calculation are given in ﬁgure 14. The total energy
E = 16.4 eV is such that there are three “closed” states for each l. Of the extra (over
CCC(15,5)) three states for each l one has gone into the discrete spectrum and two into
the continuum.

In ﬁgure 15 the SDCS arising from the CCC(18,5) calculation is considered. No
experimental SDCS are available at this energy. At this energy the SDCS at E/2
is quite substantial, and thus we see unphysical oscillations in both the singlet and
triplet components, though integrals of both yield excellent agreement with experiment,
see ﬁgure 1. The unphysical oscillations indicate that the angular distributions will
have incorrect magnitudes. We suppose that the integral preserving quadratic estimate
labeled by CCC(∞, 5) is the step-function that the close-coupling formalism would
converge to for inﬁnite N0. Convergence at exactly E/2 is to a quarter the height
of the step, and is readily obtained in ﬁnite calculations, as we shall see at the next

available for this case. The singlet and triplet components evaluated using both sides

The corresponding TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 17. The coplanar relative θAB

e-H ionization

measurements of R¨oder et al (1996a) have been scaled by a single factor for best overall
visual ﬁt. The DWBA with polarization and PCI eﬀects calculation, presented in
arbitrary units by R¨oder et al (1996a), has been scaled to ﬁt experiment as done by
R¨oder et al (1996a). In order to internormalize the coplanar symmetric data presented
by Whelan et al (1994) we have extracted the symmetric geometry points from the
θAB measurements. The symmetric geometry calculation of Whelan et al (1994) is
internormalized to the θAB calculations, and is the reason why it is substantially higher
than experiment compared to the initial presentation (Whelan et al 1994).

The ﬁrst thing to note is the excellent agreement between the coherent and
incoherent combinations of amplitudes for both spins. The corresponding thick and
thin curves are almost indistinguishable. There are some examples where the diﬀerence
is quite visible. For the θAB = 150◦ case around 0◦ and 160◦ there is approximately 15%
diﬀerence. However, the diﬀerence between the |fS(k, q)|2 and |fS(q, k)|2 components
(not plotted) is around 50%. It is due to (25) applied to (26) that allows for such good
agreement between the coherent and incoherent prescriptions.

Looking at the case θAB = 80◦ the agreement between the CCC theory and
experiment appears satisfactory. However, increasing the diﬀerence between the two
detectors by just 10◦ results in a large rise in the experimental TDCS in the region of
20◦ and 60◦ degrees. This is not reproduced by either theory, both of which predict only
a marginal increase in the TDCS. In going from θAB = 90◦ to θAB = 100◦ both theories
and experiment predict a small increase in the TDCS, with the discrepancy in the 20◦
to 80◦ angular range remaining. Increasing θAB by 20◦ more results in the experimental
TDCS at 20◦ and 70◦ to drop substantially in magnitude similarly to the CCC theory.
Curiously, if all of the θAB = 90◦, 100◦, 120◦, 150◦ measurements in the region of 20◦ to
120◦ degrees were reduced by a factor of 0.7 or so very good agreement with the CCC
theory would be obtained.

For variety we have also given results for the θA = 45◦ geometry. It is interesting
since in the region of θB = −45◦ the singlet component goes through a maximum while
the triplet goes to zero due to antisymmetry, resulting in a triply peaked spin-averaged
TDCS.

The socalled doubly symmetric (EA = EB, θA = −θB) geometry provides a good
overall test of how well the CCC formalism is working. The two terms in (20) are
identical (TDCS has cos θ dependence, hence independent of ±θ). The triplet amplitude
should be identically zero at all angles due to the Pauli principle, while the singlet
amplitude should be zero at forward and backward angles due to the electron-electron
repulsion. Looking at this case we see that the triplet thin curve is near zero at most
scattering angles, but rises at the forward angles. The coherent combination, on the
other hand, yields identically zero for the triplet cross section as desired. To trace the
source of the problem is quite simple. By generating the TDCS after each partial wave
J of total orbital angular momentum we ﬁnd that the forward triplet TDCS grows
for J > 5. This is because exchange may only be treated properly between electron
functions of same angular momentum. Given that we have lmax = 5, for higher L of

the projectile exchange cannot be fully implemented. Though presently not practical,
for computational reasons, larger lmax would be necessary to obtain even smaller triplet
TDCS.

Overall, we ﬁnd the agreement with experiment in this case somewhat disturbing.
Here the excess energy is 16.4 eV. It is interesting to compare with the 44.6 eV e-He
ionization case, where the excess energy is 20 eV (Rioual et al 1998). Generally much
better agreement with experiment is found in this case, particularly at θAB = 90◦.
Incidentally, the rescaling of the CCC theory in the latter case was independently found
to be a factor of two.

3.5. Incident electron energy 27.2 eV

This energy is particularly interesting due to experimental data being available at
EB = 2 eV (Berakdar et al 1996), EB = 4 eV (Ehrhardt and R¨oder 1997) and
EB = EA = 6.8 eV (Brauner et al 1991b) secondary energies. Unfortunately the data are
relative and may not be related across the energy-sharing. This case has been recently
studied by Jones and Madison (1998) and Berakdar et al (1999). The latter presented
the 3C, DS3C and a CCC(15,5) calculation, and suggested that the calculations of Jones
and Madison (1998) may be much too low. Here we present the results of a CCC(18,5)
calculation. Its results are compared to those of the CCC(15,5) calculation to test both
the convergence and the rescaling prescription.

The energy levels of this calculation are given in ﬁgure 18. They diﬀer substantially
from those used in the CCC(15,5) calculation (Berakdar et al 1999), and thus provide
for a particularly good test of the CCC formalism for increasing N0. The λl were chosen
so that one of the energies was equal to 6.8 eV for each l.

In ﬁgure 19 the SDCS arising from the CCC(18,5) calculation are considered. No
experimental SDCS are available at this energy, but we compare with the SDCS arising
from the CCC(15,5) calculation (Berakdar et al 1999). The discussion of the 30 eV SDCS
is equally applicable here, including the estimation of CCC(∞, 5). Some diﬀerence can
be seen between the CCC(18,5) and CCC(15,5) SDCS, with the former showing more
oscillation than the latter. Yet the two SDCS are nearly identical at E/2.

The corresponding TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 20. We see that in all cases the
agreement between the two CCC calculations is very good, conﬁrming the claim of
relatively fast convergence in the angular distributions generally, and absolute values,
so long as account is taken that convergence of the raw CCC results at E/2 is to half
the true magnitude, with subsequent rescaling. The presented calculations are also a
good check of the internal interpolation (Bray and Fursa 1996a) which is necessary in
both calculations for EB=2 and 4 eV.

Though the CCC-calculated TDCS have converged (again lmax = 5 is suﬃcient)
in both shape and magnitude (after rescaling), occasional substantial discrepancy with
experiment is disturbing. A case we would like to single out is for EB = EA, θA = 45◦.
Here, as at 30 eV, around θB = −45◦ the singlet TDCS goes through a maximum while

Figure 20. The coplanar triply diﬀerential cross sections for 27.2 eV electron-impact
ionization of the ground state of atomic hydrogen. The internormalized relative EB =2,
4, and 6.8 eV measurements are from Berakdar et al (1996), Ehrhardt and R¨oder (1997)
and Brauner et al (1991b), respectively. The measurements have been normalised using
a single EB-dependent factor, to the CCC(18,5) calculation. The CCC(15,5) TDCS is
from Berakdar et al (1999), however at 6.8 eV, like the CCC(18,5) TDCS, has been
obtained using the right side of approx.

the triplet TDCS goes through zero. This leads to a triply peaked CCC-calculated
TDCS, contrary to the experimental ﬁnding. Furthermore, the DS3C calculation (see
Berakdar et al (1999)) is in much better agreement with experiment than the CCC
calculations. We have no explanation for this. Since (26) is well-satisﬁed the problem is
not due symmetry problems in the amplitudes. Whereas agreement with experiment is
satisfactory at θA = 15◦ and θA = 30◦ such discrepancy for θA = 45◦ is surprising. For
other cases the agreement with experiment is generally satisfactory.

3.6. Incident electron energy 25 eV

At 25 eV coplanar equal energy-sharing relative ﬁxed θAB data are available (R¨oder
et al 1996a) as well as for the symmetric geometry (Whelan et al 1994). In ﬁgure 21
the energy levels of the CCC(18,5) calculation are presented. For each l there is a state
with energy E/2 = 5.7 eV.

In ﬁgure 22 the SDCS arising from the CCC(18,5) calculation are considered and
compared with the data of Shyn (1992). Once again the discussion of the 30 eV SDCS is
equally applicable here. We see good agreement of the CCC(∞, 5) estimate (see above)
with the experimental data, which at this energy has not been rescaled as it is already

The 25 eV DDCS are given in ﬁgure 23 and are compared with experiment. This
time we ﬁnd complete agreement with experiment. Why this should be so at this,
relatively low, energy and not at higher ones is a somewhat surprising, and may be
coincidental. Once again very good agreement between the two sides of (26) is found
for both the singlet and triplet components.

to the theory.
In order to internormalize the coplanar symmetric data presented by
Whelan et al (1994) we have extracted the symmetric geometry points from the θAB
measurements. The general agreement with experiment is not too bad. The transition
from θAB = 80◦ to θAB = 90◦ is now more consistent than in the case of 30 eV incident
energy. Interestingly, as at 30 eV, a systematic reduction of the measurements in the
20◦-80◦ region relative to others would result in even better agreement with experiment.
The decomposition of the CCC results into their singlet and triplet components is
helpful to check the accuracy of the coherent versus incoherent combinations of the
CCC amplitudes, see (26).

3.7. Incident electron energy 20 eV

The availability of the 20 eV incident energy measurements is much the same as for the
30 and 25 eV cases. Coplanar data are available for equal energy-sharing relative ﬁxed
θAB and symmetric geometries (R¨oder et al 1996a, Whelan et al 1994).

In ﬁgure 25 the energy levels of the CCC(18,5) calculation are presented, where

not used in the present calculations since data is only available for the equal-energy-

overall visual ﬁt to the CCC(18,5) theory.
In order to internormalize the symmetric
data (Whelan et al 1994) we have extracted the symmetric geometry points from
the θAB measurements. We see that for the smaller θAB there is a major problem.
Though the shape of theory and experiment is generally quite similar there is signiﬁcant
discrepancy in magnitude. We wonder if the experimental internormalization is at
least partially responsible for the discrepancy. For small EA = EB and small θAB
the TDCS are particularly small, and it would be helpful to have a number of ﬁxed θA
geometries measured to check the consistency of the internormalization. Because of the
substantial discrepancies we performed many calculations which included CCC(18,4)
and CCC(20,5) models. These yield barely diﬀerent results, in shape and magnitude,
to those presented. We acknowledge certain numerical diﬃculties with the presented
calculations as can be observed from the non-zero triplet TDCS for the symmetric
geometry calculated using the incoherent combination of amplitudes. However, we do
not believe they are the cause of the substantial discrepancies observed here, since
generally the agreement between the two sides of (26) is very good.

3.8. Incident electron energy 17.6 eV

We now approach the near threshold region of e-H ionization. Here absolute TDCS are
available (R¨oder et al 1997b). Furthermore, the data are very detailed in that both ﬁxed
θA and θAB, as well as symmetric geometries have been measured. As before, all of the
data are coplanar.

In ﬁgure 29 the energy levels of the CCC(20,5) calculation are presented. The
value of N0 has been increased and the λl decreased in order to get a more accurate
description of the kinematic region below the E = 4 eV total energy. We also performed
many smaller calculations which show marginal diﬀerence to the largest presented.

In ﬁgure 30 the SDCS arising from the CCC(20,5) calculation are considered. We
see that the triplet component is now even lower than the singlet, showing similar but
less pronounced unphysical oscillations.

For completeness the 17.6 eV DDCS are given in ﬁgure 31. It shows the unusual

situation where forward and backward scattering are equally dominant.

The TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 32. In order to obtain best visual agreement of
the rescaled CCC(20,5) calculations with experiment as a whole the measurements were
scaled by a factor of 0.5. This is a little outside the ±40% experimental uncertainty
(R¨oder et al 1997b).

As at 20 eV there are substantial discrepancies for the ﬁxed small θAB geometries.
This time it is not just a problem of internormalization. The discrepancy around
60◦ is substantially smaller than at say 120◦.
It is particularly helpful to have so
many diﬀerent geometries measured. The symmetric geometry deﬁnes the relationship
between the singlet theoretical component and the experiment. The discrepancy at
backward θA = −θB angles is responsible for the diﬀerence between experiment and
theory in the region of −120◦ for the θAB = 90◦, 100◦, 120◦ geometries. The singlet

and triplet components evaluated according to (26) are in good agreement with each
other generally. One exception is at forward angles of the symmetric geometry where
the triplet TDCS evaluated using the left side of (26) is non-zero. The right side of (26)
yields identically zero for the triplet cross section.

We are also able to check the internal consistency of the measurements by taking say
the θA = 140◦ measurements and plotting them at the appropriate points on the constant
θAB plots. The solid circles are examples of this. We see substantial inconsistency of
the measurements. The inconsistent improvement in the agreement between theory
and experiment, by simply increasing a particular set of constant θAB measurements,
implies that internormalization is not the sole reason for the discrepancy between theory
and experiment. We hope that the presented experimental inconsistency will lead to
experimental reinvestigation of this incident energy.

R¨oder et al (1997b) also presented the distorted partial-wave (DPW) calculation of
Pan and Starace (1992), available only for θAB = 180◦. Comparison of the CCC results
with this calculation is also presented in ﬁgure 32. The CCC estimate is around 1.5
times lower than the DPW calculation.

3.9. Incident electron energy 15.6 eV

This energy was the subject of the preliminary investigation of this work (Bray 1999).
We present these results here for completeness, to give more information and for ready
contrast to other energies. Furthermore, the earlier results were rescaled up by a factor
of 2.7 upon the assumption of a ﬂat true SDCS. Here we obtain the magnitude ab
initio, which indicates that the previous results should heve been scaled up by exactly a

that in the case of double photoionization agreement with the SDCS(E/2) of Pont and
Shakeshaft (1995) implies that the CCC method is also able to predict ﬂat even convex
SDCS.

The energies arising in the CCC(20,5) calculations are given in ﬁgure 33. The
λl ≈ 0.6 have been reduced further in order to have more states of energy less than the
2 eV total energy. Though the ideal value of λ0 for the 1S state is two, with a basis size
of 20 there is no diﬃculty in reproducing the 1S state even with λ0 ≈ 0.6.

In ﬁgure 34 the SDCS arising from the CCC(20,5) calculation are considered.
Also given is the spin-averaged SDCS of the CCC(13,4) calculation published earlier
(Bray 1999). The two agree very well at the E/2 point, and yield a quarter of the true
SDCS. Whereas previously we thought that this was an indication of extremely slow
convergence, now we realize that convergence has been achieved in the CCC-calculated
amplitudes, but to half the true magnitude. The shape of the CCC-calculated SDCS
has changed substantially from the ﬂat SDCS we supposed earlier (Bray 1999). Perhaps
the work of Baertschy et al (1999) applied to the full e-H problem will give deﬁnitive
SDCS that may be compared with the estimates given.

The 15.6 eV DDCS are given in ﬁgure 35. Remarkably we ﬁnd that backward

The TDCS are presented in ﬁgure 36. In contrast to the slightly higher incident
energies we ﬁnd excellent agreement between theory and experiment, after the latter
has been reduced by 0.4. We do note, however, that the original internormalization of
the θAB = 100◦ measurements was not consistent with the θB = −50◦ (solid) point of
the θA = −150◦ geometry. Accordingly, we imposed this internormalization by scaling
the θAB = 100◦ measurements by a factor of 1.5 before plotting. The θAB = 120◦
measurements are reasonably consistent with the θB = −30◦ point of the θA = −150◦

(Bray 1999), but here is evaluated according to (26).

The uniform reduction of the experiment by the factor of 0.4 is outside the stated
±35 % uncertainty of the absolute value determination (R¨oder et al 1997b). The true
SDCS would have to be highly convex in order for the experimental absolute values
to be correct. Recall that the CCC-calculated and estimated SDCS correctly yield the
spin-dependent total ionization cross sections at this energy (see ﬁgure 1).

4. Conclusions

We have performed an extensive and systematic study of e-H ionization from 250 eV
to 15.6 eV incident energy. We showed how the close-coupling approach to ionization
converges to the Born approximation at high energies. While we believe it is common
knowledge that exchange eﬀects disappear at high energies, Bencze and Chandler (1999)
argue that the treatment of exchange in our formalism should lead to amplitudes that
satisfy the symmetrization postulate and hence yield a symmetric SDCS. Their argument
is independent of energy, and it is our view that this claim is incorrect. Instead, we still
suspect to be true the step function hypothesis (Bray 1997), which states that with
increasing N the CCC-calculated amplitudes should converge to zero on the secondary
energy range of [E/2, E], for all total energies E. The presented results are consistent
with this idea, and the unphysical oscillations in the SDCS for small E being due to the
inability of a ﬁnite expansion being able to describe a step function of substantial step
size. Thus, for any ﬁnite N the CCC-calculated ionization scattering amplitudes will
generally not satisfy the symmetrization postulate (23).

The analysis of Stelbovics (1999) shows that at E/2 the CCC-calculated amplitudes
should be combined coherently. This is consistent with the step-function hypothesis
with the E/2 amplitudes converging to half the step size, just like in fourier expansions.
Accordingly, the unitarity preserving incoherent prescription given by Bray and Fursa
(1996a) needs to be multiplied by two, but only at E/2. Subsequently, the two
combinations of amplitudes yield near identical results for all considered cases. This
is due to the fact that the CCC amplitudes at E/2 satisfy the symmetrization
postulate, at least approximately. The eﬀect of any deviation from this on the TDCS
is particularly small, see discussion following (25). This reconciles the coherent versus
incoherent combinations of the total-spin-dependent CCC amplitudes as both being
eﬀectively multiplications by two. Recall that the CCC amplitude is already a coherent
combination of its direct and exchange amplitudes depending on the total spin.

The above discussion is only applicable to the equal-energy-sharing kinematical
region, where now we can claim to obtain fully ab initio results convergent, using
realistic calculations, in both shape and magnitude. The situation for the asymmetric
kinematical region is much less satisfactory. We are still unable to obtain convergence
generally at low-enough total energies E. The analysis of Stelbovics (1999) is formally
only appropriate at E/2, unless the CCC amplitudes in the region [E/2, E] are
identically zero. In other words, if the step-function hypothesis is true then his work

e-H ionization

(k, q)| ≫ |f (N )

implies that the CCC amplitudes in the region [0, E/2] will be unambiguously deﬁned.
In practice, when comparing with experiment the step-function idea is well satisﬁed as
we ﬁnd that |f (N )
(q, k)| for q < k. Hence, a coherent or an incoherent
combination makes no discernible diﬀerence from just using the amplitude f (N )
(k, q).
Comparison with experiment is somewhat mixed. We ﬁnd it particularly disturbing
that the fundamental e-H DDCS have not been accurately determined experimentally.
We make this claim by reference to the inconsistency between the data of Shyn (1992)
and Shah et al (1987).
In our view it is more important to obtain accurate DDCS,
preferably absolute, than performing more complicated TDCS experiments. In support
of this we have given an extensive spin-resolved set of DDCS for future comparison.

S

Turning our attention to the TDCS we ﬁnd the agreement with experiment
somewhat inconsistent. At high energies the agreement is generally satisfactory. This
varies, sometimes quite substantially, as the incident energy is reduced. We believe that
the CCC results presented accurately reﬂect the close-coupling approach to ionization
in that further even larger calculations, when computer resources permit, will not yield
substantially diﬀerent results. There is some uncertainty associated with the semi-
empirical rescaling. However, given the nature of some of the discrepancies, at this
point, this is the least of our concerns. The fundamental question we have is whether
or not the close-coupling approach to ionization, as we have deﬁned it, converges to the
true TDCS. The result of the present study suggests that this is still an open question.
Further measurements, particularly in order to eliminate the presented experimental
inconsistencies, would be very welcome, and help answer this question.

While it is clear that the close-coupling formalism is unable to yield accurate SDCS
for small enough E this does not necessarily aﬀect the angular proﬁles of the TDCS
as discussed earlier (Bray 1999). The equivalent-quadrature idea in application to the
systematic generation of the square-integrable states helps to ensure rapid convergence
in the angular proﬁles. This may be readily checked numerically, as we have here in
ﬁgure 20 for 27.2 eV and did earlier at 15.6 eV (Bray 1999). The utility of the rescaling
prescription depends on the accuracy of the estimate of the true spin-resolved SDCS.
Should this become known, as appears likely (Baertschy et al 1999), then more accurate
rescaling may be performed than what was presented here. This, however, is only
applicable to the asymmetric energy-sharing kinematics. At equal energy-sharing we
are no-longer free to rescale our results as previously thought.

The great strength of the close-coupling approach to ionization is that it uniﬁes the
treatment of both the discrete and continuum parts of the atomic spectrum. We have
already established the importance of treating the target continuum in application to
discrete excitation processes (Bray 1994b). Similarly, we suspect that discrete excitation
processes need to be treated in order to assure accuracy of ionization calculations
at all energies. We certainly hope that the present work will stimulate further e-H
ionization measurements and calculations, and therefore test the ability of the present
implementation of the CCC theory to be predictive.

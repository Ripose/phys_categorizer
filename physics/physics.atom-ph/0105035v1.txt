Schr¨odinger uncertainty relation and its
minimization states ∗

February 2, 2008

Abstract

An introductory survey on the Schr¨odinger uncertainty relation and its minimization states
is presented with minimal number of formulas and some historical points. The case of the two
canonical observables, position and momentum, is discussed in greater detail: basic properties
of the two subsets of minimization states (canonical squeezed and coherent states) are reviewed
and compared. The case of two non-canonical observables is breaﬂy outlined. Stanfard SU(1,1)
and SU(2) group-related coherent states can be deﬁned as states that minimize Schr¨odinger
inequality for the three pairs of generators simultaneously. The symmetry of the Heisenberg
and Schr¨odinger relations is also discussed, and two natural generalizations to the cases of
several observables and several states are noted.

1 The Heisenberg uncertainty principle

×

10−

The uncertainty (indeterminacy) principle is a basic feature of quantum physics. It reveals the
fundamental diﬀerence between quantum and classical descriptions of Nature. The indeterminacy
principle was introduced in 1927 by Heisenberg [1] who demonstrated the impossibility of simul-
taneous precise measurement of the canonical quantum observables ˆx and ˆpx (the coordinate and
¯h, where ¯h is the Plank constant,
the momentum) by positing an approximate relation δpxδx
27 erg.sec. ”The more precisely is the position determined, the less precisely is the
¯h = 1.05
momentum known, and vice versa” [1]. Heisenberg considered this inequality as the ”direct descrip-
tive interpretation” of the canonical commutation relation between the operators of the coordinate
ˆpx ˆx. Qualitative statements about the repugnance of
and momentum: [ˆx, ˆpx] = i¯h, [ˆx, ˆpx]
the precise determination of the coordinate with that of the momentum have been formulated in
1926 also by Dirac and Jordan (see refs. in M.Jammer, The conceptual development of quantum mechanics,
Mc Graw-Hill, 1967). Let us recall that in quantum physics a physical quantity (observable) X is
represented by a Hermitian operator ˆX in the Hilbert space of states. Soon after the Heisenberg
paper [1] appeared Kennard and Weyl [2] proved the inequality

which Heisenberg derived his relation, resorting to the properties of the Fourier transformation.

Robertson inequality (2) became known again as the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for two observ-
ables ˆX and ˆY , and it is regarded as a mathematical formulation of the Heisenberg indeterminacy
principle for two quantum observables. In view of this inertia and of the signiﬁcant Robertson’
contribution we shall refer to the relation (2) as Heisenberg–Robertson inequality or Heisenberg–
Robertson uncertainty relation (while (1) is referred to as Heisenberg relation).

2 The Schr¨odinger inequality

The Heisenberg–Robertson uncertainty relation (2) and/or its particular case (1) became an irrevo-
cable part of almost every textbook in quantum mechanics. However from the classical probability
theory it is known that for two random quantities one can deﬁne three second moments: the vari-
ances of each observable and their covariance. In the relations (2) and (1) the two variances ˆX
and ˆY are involved only. This fact was ﬁrst noted by Schr¨odinger in 1930 [4], who derived (using
Schwartz inequality) the more general inequality

theory the vanishing covariance is a necessary (but not suﬃcient) condition for the statistical inde-
pendence of two random quantities. Nonvanishing covariance means stronger correlation between
physical quantities.

parameters with dimension of mass and frequency respectively. For ˆq and ˆp the Heisenberg and

The Schr¨odinger inequality (3) is more general and more precise than that of Heisenberg–
Robertson, eq. (2): the former is reduced to the latter in states with vanishing covariance of ˆX
and ˆY , and the equality in (2) means the equality in (3), the inverse being not true. Thus the
Schr¨odinger inequality provides a more stringent limitation (from below) to the product ot two
variances. Despite of these advantages the relation (4) and/or (3) are lacking in almost all text
books. The interest in Schr¨odinger relation has been renewed in the last two decades only (for
the ﬁrst time, to the best of my knowledge, in ref. [5] – 50 years after its discovery) in connection
with the description and experimental realization of the squeezed states (SS) of the electromagnetic
radiation [6, 7].

1 Other notations, used in the literature, for the covariance (variance), are Cov(X, Y ), σXY , ∆(X, Y ) (Var(X),
X , ∆X2, ∆2X). In his original paper [4] Schr¨odinger didn’t introduce any symbol for the quantity (1/2)

Another useful property of the Schr¨odinger uncertainty relation consists in its form-invariance
against nondegenerate linear transformations of the two observables [9]. If one transforms ˆX, ˆY to
ˆX ′, ˆY ′,

ˆX ′ = λ11 ˆX + λ12 ˆY ,

ˆY ′ = λ21 ˆX + λ22Y,

one would obtain that the left and the right hand sides of (3) are transformed in the same manner
(covariantly) – by multiplication by the factor (det Λ)2, where Λ is 2
2 matrix of the transformation
coeﬃcients λij. It then follows that if a given state saturates (3) for ˆX and ˆY , it saturates (3) for
the transformed observables ˆX ′, ˆY ′ as well. The covariance of the Heisenberg–Robertson inequality,
eq. (2), is much more restricted: both its sides are transformed in the same manner under the
linear scale transformations of the observables ˆX ′ = a ˆX, ˆY ′ = b ˆY only. In the case of canonical
observables this restricted covariance means that the equality in (1) is not invariant under linear
canonical transformations, in particular it is not invariant under rotations in the phase plane.

×

The scale transformations and the rotations form two distinct subgroups of the group of linear
canonical transformations. It is quite natural then to look for another uncertainty relation for q
and p which is covariant (the equality being invariant) under the rotations in the phase space. It
turned out that such covariant inequality does exist: it has the simple form of

(5)

This inequality is less precise than (4) and (1) in the sense that the equality in it entails the equality
in both (4) and (1). The equality in (5) is invariant under rotations in the phase plane.

The most precise inequality, the Schr¨odinger one, eq. (4), is most symmetric – the equality in
(4) is invariant under both subgroups (rotations and scale transformations) of the group of linear
canonical transformations of ˆq and ˆp. For two arbitrary observables (Hermitian operators) the
inequality (5) takes the form (∆X)2 + (∆Y )2

3 Minimization of the uncertainty relations

The interest in minimization of uncertainty relations has increased after the discovery of coherent
states (CS) of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in 1963 (independently by the american physicists Klauder,
Glauber and Sudarshan – see refs. in [11]), and especially after the discovery of squeezed states (SS)
[6, 7]. Next we consider the basic properties of states, that minimize Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger
inequalities for the canonical pair ˆp, ˆq (subsections A and B) and for some non-canonical observ-
ables: the spin and quasi-spin components (subsection C).

States which minimize the Heisenberg-Robertson inequality (2) have been called intelligent
(C.Aragon et al, J.Math.Phys. 17 (1976) 1963), while those which minimize the more general Schr¨odinger
inequality (3) were named correlated [5] and generalized intelligent states [9]. The names Heisen-
berg (Schr¨odinger) intelligent states, Heisenberg (Schr¨odinger) minimum uncertainty states and
Heisenberg (Schr¨odinger) optimal uncertainty states are also used (see the review papers D.A.Trifonov,
JOSA A 17, 2486 (2000) (e-print quant-ph/0012072); e-print quant/9912084 and refs. therein).

A. Minimization of the Heisenberg inequality

As it could be seen from (3) and (2) the problem of minimization of the Heisenberg-Robertson
relation is a particular case of the minimization of the Schr¨odinger inequality, corresponding
In fact it was Heisenberg [1] who

has ﬁrst minimized the inequality (1), showing that for Gaussian distribution of x of the form
x′)2/(δx)2] the equality δxδpx = h/2 holds. The problem of minimization of inequalities
exp[
(2), (4) or (3) was not considered in Robertson and Schr¨odinger papers [3, 4].

Glauber CS. Most widely known minimizing states are the CS of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
[11], which are considered as states of the ideal monochromatic laser radiation. These states
(called Glauber-Klauder-Sudarshan CS, Glauber CS, or canonical CS) are deﬁned as normalized

theoretical and mathematical physics.

Before describing the properties of the Glauber CS it would be useful to recall the stationary states

(with
corresponding wave function ψn(x)) of the harmonic oscillator. Stationary states are deﬁned for every quantum
system as states with deﬁnite energy, i.e. as eigenstates of the energy operator (the Hamiltonian) ˆH. For the
mass oscillator (a particle with mass m in the parabolic potential well U (x) = mω2x2/2) the Hamiltonian is
ˆH = ˆp2/2m + mω2x2/2.

variances of ˆq and ˆp are equal: (∆q)2 = 1/2,
(∆p)2 = 1/2. These two moments minimize the
Heisenberg inequality. Due to this inequality the value of 1/2 is the minimal possible one that
two dispersions (∆p)2 and (∆p)2 can take simultaneously. The CS
are the only states with
this property: In any other state at least one of the two dispersions is greater than 1/2. This fact
means that in CS
the trajectory of the mass oscillator in the phase space is determined with
the highest possible accuracy. Correspondingly, in the context of electromagnetic ﬁeld we have

of any power of ˆa. This remarkable property is typical for inﬁnite superpositions of

are. It is the ”inﬁnity” that compensates the annihilation of the n photons. Unlike ˆa, the
CS
creation operator ˆa† has no eigenstate at all, and the photon added states ˆa†
are no more CS.
All ladder operators in ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space have no eigenstates (except for the state,
that is annihilated by the ladder operator).
From the remarkable mathematical properties of the canonical CS we will note here their ”over-
completeness” and ”orbitality”. The ﬁrst property means that the family of CS
is overcomplete
in the Hilbert space, i.e. any other state
can be represented as a continuous superposition of
d2α. This overcompleteness enables one to represent states as analytic
CS:
α
i
functions of α (or as functions in the phase space respectively), and abstract operators – as dif-
ferential operators. For example, ˆa = d/dα and ˆa† = α. This CS representation provides the
possibility to use powerful analytic method in treating various problems of quantum physics. It
is very convenient in elucidating the relationship between quantum and classical description of
physical systems.

of Weyl operators. The set of Weyl operators form an unitary representation of the group of
Heisenberg-Weyl. As early as in 1963 Klauder suggested that overcomplete families of states
could be constructed using unitary representations of other Lie groups. For the group of rotations
SO(3) such overcomplete family was constructed in 1971 by Radcliﬀe (spin CS), and for the group
of pseudo-rotations SO(1, 2) – by Solomon in 1971 (A. Solomon, J.Math.Phys. 12, 390 (1971)) and
Perelomov in 1972 (quasi-spin CS) (see refs. in [11]). Perelomov proved that orbits of operators of
irreducible unitary representations of any Lie group do form overcomplete sets of states. The quan-
tum evolution operators of system with Lie group symmetry are operators of the corresponding
unitary representations of the group. This gives the idea how to generate physically new families
of states starting from known initial ones.

It is also called ellipse of equal probabilities or Wigner ellipse, since Wigner

At t = t0 the semiaxes are parallel to the coordinate axes. At t > t0 they are rotated to an

angle of ϕ =
determines the inclination of the ellipse axes to the coordinate axes. Thus the free ﬁeld time-
evolution rotates the Wigner ellipse, preserving the length of its semiaxes (therefore its area is
also constant) (see Fig. 3). The (stationary and nonstationary) oscillator time-evolution of the
variances of ˆq and ˆp in Gaussian wave packets has been studied as early as in 1974 (M.Sargent,
M.Scully and W.Lamb, Laser physics, Addison-Wesley, 1974; D.Trifonov, Phys.Lett. A48 (1974) 165 ).

Despite of the functional closeness of the wave functions of SS

some of their
physical properties are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The main diﬀerence consists in the squeeze-eﬀect,

may be negative over some range of α′ (see [7] and refs. therein). Due to violation of the positivity
became known as non-classical states. This non-classicality is
of this quasi-probability
closely related to the squeeze-eﬀect: reduction of the ﬂuctuations of ˆq or ˆp in a given quantum
state is a suﬃcient condition for the non-positivity of P (α′). The third diﬀerence between CS and
SS is related to their photon distributions. The Poisson photon distribution in the laser radiation

Again there is a relation to the non-positivity of the Glauber-Sudarshan quasi-distribution: the
latter is non-positive deﬁnite, if (∆n)2 <

as photon antibunching (impossibility to detect photons in arbitrary closed moments of time). Ideal
photon antibunching (or maximal non-classicality) is exhibit in the states

states for other pairs of (noncanonical) observables ˆX, ˆY , i.e. of ﬁeld states with reduced quantum
ﬂuctuations of ˆX or ˆY . In paper [9] it was proposed to construct SS for two general observables
as states, that minimize Schr¨odinger inequality (3). Such minimizing states were called [9] ˆX– ˆY
generalized intelligent states, or ˆX– ˆY Schr¨odinger intelligent states. Following [5] they could be
called ˆX– ˆY correlated states. The inequality (3) is minimized in a state

Schr¨odinger intelligent states are constructed analytically for every pair of the quasi-spin (Ki–
Kj) and spin (Ji–Jj) components (see e.g. quant-ph/9912084; JOSA A 17 (2000) 2486, and refs. therein).
Are there states of systems with SU (1, 1) (SU (2)) symmetry that minimize Schr¨odinger uncertainty
relation for all the three pairs K1–K2, K2–K3 and K3–K1 (J1–J2, J2–J3 and J3–J1) simultane-
ously ? The answer to this question is positive: such states with optimally balanced ﬂuctuations
of the three observables K1, K2, K3 (J1, J2, J3) (states with maximal su(1, 1) or su(2) intelligency)
are the known Klauder-Perelomov SU (1, 1) CS (Radcliﬀe-Gilmore SU (2) CS) only (proof in quant-
ph/9912084 and in J. Phys. A 31 (1998) 8041). For the above noted one-mode realization of the
su(1, 1) these group related CS coincide with the known squeezed vacuum states and in our no-
tations here they are

minimize the Schr¨odinger relation for ˆq and ˆp as well. Hence the squeezed vacuum states are the
unique states that minimize Schr¨odinger inequalities for four pairs of observables Ki–Kj and q–p

4 Generalizations of the Schr¨odinger uncertainty relation

The Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger uncertainty relations reveal quantitatively the statistical correla-
tions between two observables in one and the same state. Two natural questions can be immedi-
ately formulated: are there statistical correlations
a) between several observables in one state?
b) between observables in two and more states?

The positive answer to the ﬁrst question was given by Robertson in 1934 [Phys. Rev. 46 794

(1934)] by proving of the inequality

where σ is the matrix of all second moments (the uncertainty, the covariance or dispersion matrix)
of n observables ˆX1, . . . , ˆXn, and C is the matrix of mean values of their commutators, σjk =

The second question also has a positive answer [D.A.Trifonov, J. Phys. A33 (2000) L296]. Here is

this inequality reproduces
that of Schr¨odinger, eq. (4). The relation (9) is neither a sum nor a product of the two Schr¨odinger
relations for
correspondingly. It can not be represented as a sum or as a product of
two quantities, each one depending on one of the two states only. Such unfactorizable uncertainty
relations are called state entangled. The inequality (9), and (4) as well, contains the second
statistical moments of ˆq and ˆp, which are measurable quantities. The experimental veriﬁcation of
the relation (9) would be, we hope, a new conﬁrmation of the Hilbert space model of quantum
physics.

1. Introduction

1998, Walls et al

2003, Magnus et al

Laser spectroscopy of the lithium D lines has attracted much attention in recent
years (see e.g., (Olivares et al
2005)
and references therein). Accurate measurements of isotope shifts together with
theoretical calculations of both isotopes of the simplest alkali element could improve
the precision of important fundamental constants such as the ﬁne structure constant
(Wijngaarden 2005). Comparison of theoretical calculations of atomic hyperﬁne
splitting with experimental results may provide a test for QED (Ashby et al 2003).
Lithium has two stable isotopes, 6Li (natural abundance 7.5 %) and 7Li (natural
6Li is the only stable fermionic alkali isotope apart from the
abundance 92.5 %).
naturally rare 40K. The quantum statistics of fermions dramatically diﬀers from the
statistics of bosons and in several experiments worldwide this interesting behaviour
has been explored (see e.g., (Jochim et al 2003, Zwierlein et al 2003, Bourdel et al
2004)). In previous studies (Walls et al 2003, Olivares et al 1998) spectroscopy of the
22P1/2,3/2 levels of 6Li have been carried out using a linear Doppler-free method, based
on a collimated atomic-beam and a heat pipe. In both cases the spectral resolution
is limited by the natural linewidth of the optical transition. More recently Magnus
et al (Magnus et al 2005) reported the ﬁrst study of Electromagnetically Induced
Transparency (EIT) on the D1 and D2 lines of 7Li in a vapour.
In this paper we
present sub-Doppler and sub-natural linewidth spectroscopy of 6Li performed on both
the D1 and D2 lines using several nonlinear techniques.

Light-induced ground state coherence eﬀects such as EIT (Harris 1997) can
provide spectral resolution well below the natural width of the atomic transition.
Coherence eﬀects in alkali atoms with half-integer total angular momentum (F=J+I,
J=L±1/2) have not, to our knowledge, been previously investigated. The integer
nuclear spin (I=1) of 6Li makes it an interesting atomic species for coherence
spectroscopy.
Additionally we use a Ramsey-type conﬁguration of coherence
spectroscopy in an atomic beam to reduce time of ﬂight broadening.

A schematic diagram of the relevant atomic energy levels is shown in ﬁgure 1.
The strongest optical transitions of 6Li are two electric dipole transitions 22S1/2 →
22P1/2 (D1 line) and 22S1/2 → 22P3/2 (D2 line) which are separated by a ﬁne splitting
of ∼ 10 GHz. The hyperﬁne splitting of the 22S1/2 ground state is 228.2 MHz and the
hyperﬁne splitting of the excited 22P1/2 state is 26.1 MHz (Walls et al 2003). The
hyperﬁne splitting of the 22P3/2 state is smaller than the 6 MHz natural width of the
optical transition.

2. Saturation Spectroscopy

Saturation spectroscopy in a lithium vapour cell (ﬁgure 2) provides sub-Doppler
reference resonances for laser frequency stabilization. An external cavity diode laser
(ECDL) (Toptica DL 100) is used as the source of the resonant optical ﬁeld which
has an output power of 15 mW and a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. Using
the so-called feed-forward technique, where both the diode current and the grating
position are varied, a ﬁne frequency tuning range of over 20 GHz can be obtained.
The vapour cell consists of a stainless steel crossed tube conﬁguration with a ﬂexible
bellow construction and viewports on each end of the 30 cm horizontal arm. Using
a thermocoax element the centre part of the vapour cell is heated to 350 ◦C yielding
a maximum unsaturated absorption of about 20%. At this temperature the Doppler
width is 3.5 GHz. Lithium vapour is limited by its mean free path to the centre part
of the tube, protecting the viewports from becoming coated with lithium. To further
reduce this problem we heat the viewports to 120◦ C.

Figure 2. Experimental set-up for saturation spectroscopy in a vapour cell.

In our saturation spectroscopy set-up (ﬁgure 2)

the counter-propagating
retroreﬂected laser beam, the probe, is focused onto a photodiode. Typically, the
incident laser power is 1.5 mW and has a beam diameter of 2 mm. Figure 3 shows
typical Doppler-free spectra of 6Li. A frequency scan over both the D1 and D2 lines is
shown in ﬁgure 3 (a) whereas (b) and (c) represent a close-up of the D1 and D2 lines

′
to the D2 F = 3/2 → F
= 3/2, 1/2 transitions
= 5/2, 3/2, 1/2 and F = 1/2 → F
respectively. The reduction in absorption of the probe at these outer peaks is due to
the saturation of the transition by the pump beam. The enhancement in absorption of
the crossover peak is due to compensation of optical hyperﬁne pumping, which occurs
when the pump and probe laser are resonant with both ground state sublevels at the
same time. This crossover resonance is strong if the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground
state is smaller than the Doppler width (Velichansky et al 1980) and does not exist for
other alkali atoms, such as rubidium or cesium, where the Doppler width is typically

much smaller than the ground state hyperﬁne splitting. In ﬁgure 3 (b) the incident
optical power was reduced to 150 µW to increase the resolution. Although it was not
possible to resolve the hyperﬁne splitting of the 22P1/2 state, we could partly resolve
the crossover between the transitions from the F = 1/2 and F = 3/2 ground states
(ﬁgure 3 (b)).

the ECDL is locked to the crossover dip. To achieve a stable lock, we require a large
crossover amplitude. This is obtained by applying relatively high laser intensities
in our saturation spectroscopy which ultimately broadens the width of the crossover
dip. When applying these higher intensities the structure in ﬁgure 3 (b) is no longer
observed and resembles the spectroscopy of the D2 line (ﬁgure 3 (c)). The width of
the crossover peak in ﬁgure 3 (c) is ≈ 25 MHz. The contrast ratio of the crossover
peak with respect to the Doppler broadened resonance is ≈ 100%.

3. Vapour Cell EIT

EIT is a phenomenon in which an opaque atomic medium is turned into a transparent
one in the presence of a control laser ﬁeld (Harris 1997). When two Zeeman sub-
levels or two hyperﬁne levels in an atomic ground state are coupled by light to a
common excited state, the interference between amplitudes of alternative transition
paths can substantially reduce the absorption due to destructive interference. The
atoms are pumped by the laser light into a coherent superposition of the ground
state sublevels which constitutes a non-absorbing state decoupled from the laser
ﬁeld. The absorption of the probe exhibits a narrow dip that has a sub-natural
linewidth ultimately determined by the relaxation time of the ground state sublevels.
The refractive index of the coherent atomic medium reveals extremely steep normal
dispersion in the vicinity of the EIT resonance, so that the group velocity of light in
such an atomic medium can be dramatically reduced (Schmidt et al 1996). EIT is
of great interest due to its wide application in lasing without inversion (Zibrov et al
1995), control of light propagation (slow light) (Matsko et al 2001) and enhanced
Kerr nonlinearity (Harris and Hau 1999). The concept of a non-absorbing dark state
is the key basis of light storage (Lukin 2003).

The ultimate width of an EIT resonance also depends on the mutual coherence
of the probe and control laser ﬁelds (Arimondo 1996). Ultrahigh spectral resolution
of EIT resonances in Cs and Rb vapour with large ground state splitting requires
expensive high frequency AOMs or two phase-locked lasers to couple both hyperﬁne
levels to a common excited state. Phase locking with precise frequency oﬀset is
experimentally not simple. However, in the case of lithium mutually coherent probe
and control ﬁelds can be easily prepared from the same laser using low-cost AOMs
because the ground state splitting is relatively small.

With only a single laser frequency present, the width of the absorption features
due to velocity selective optical pumping or direct saturation of optical transitions
are limited by the natural linewidth of ≈ 6 MHz. By tailoring the optical frequencies
present we performed sub-natural spectroscopy in both a vapour cell and an atomic
beam. To obtain hyperﬁne ground state coherence we use mutually coherent laser
ﬁelds whose frequencies are separated by the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state.
Although EIT can easily be obtained using only one laser and standard acousto-optical
modulators (AOMs) to shift the frequencies, we injection lock three additional slave
lasers as seen in ﬁgure 4 to provide more laser power which will be required for our
future experiments.

Figure 4 shows the experimental set-up used for EIT experiments in the vapour
cell. The ECDL (master laser) is used to injection lock three diode lasers (slaves). The
injecting light is coupled via optical isolators. The master laser is tuned to either the
D1 or D2 line and is not actively stabilized since its long-term drift is small compared
to the Doppler width. Radiation of one of the slaves is used as a pump beam for

necessary, the frequencies were shifted using AOMs. The frequency diﬀerence

typical frequencies used in the AOMs are shown in the above ﬁgure.

coupling states between the ground state F = 1/2 and the excited levels in the
D1 or D2 line. Laser light from another slave which is resonant to the F = 3/2 → F′
transitions (either D1 or D2 line) is used as a weak probe, whose transmission through
the 6Li vapour was recorded. The optical frequencies are shifted accordingly using
AOMs. One of the AOMs is in a double-pass conﬁguration where the frequency can
be swept without changing the beam alignment. The polarizations of the pump and
probe beams can be independently set using polarizers and λ/2 or λ/4 waveplates.
For the results shown here, both beams are linearly polarized and orthogonal to each
other. They are overlapped on a non-polarizing beam splitting cube and expanded
to a beam diameter of 5 mm. The pump and probe are sent through the vapour cell
with intensities of 8 mW/cm2 and 2 mW/cm2 respectively. The probe light is picked
oﬀ using a polarizing beam splitter and detected using a photodiode. The probe laser
frequency is scanned over ≈ 25 MHz while the frequency of the pump laser is ﬁxed.
To improve the signal to noise ratio the pump is amplitude modulated by means of
an mechanical chopper (1 kHz) and the probe is detected using a lock-in ampliﬁer.

3.1. Results

Figure 5 shows absorption plots of the D1 and D2 lines as a function of frequency
diﬀerence where the pump and probe beams are collinear. With no externally applied
magnetic ﬁeld a single absorption dip is observed (ﬁgure 5 (a) and 5 (d)). Applying

Note, the thicker lines represent the pump transitions. A magnetic ﬁeld of ≈ 5 G
was applied to both the perpendicular and parallel ﬁelds.

a magnetic ﬁeld, either parallel or perpendicular to the laser light, removes the
degeneracy of Zeeman levels resulting in the addition of further dips. The spectra
in ﬁgure 5 show six diﬀerent plots corresponding to the D1 or D2 line with either
parallel or perpendicular magnetic ﬁelds applied to them. For plots (a-c) ((d-f)), the
master laser is tuned to the D1 (D2) transition line. When a magnetic ﬁeld of a few
Gauss (≈ 5 G) is applied parallel to the laser light ( ~Bk~k, where ~k is the wavevector)
as in ﬁgure 5 (b) and 5 (e), the width of the resonance is ≈ 3 MHz which is sub-
natural. This width is limited by magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneities, ﬁnite interaction
(transit) time and collisions with residual gases. Both absorption dips are shifted by
∆ = µBgF B/h to either side of the zero B-ﬁeld resonance, where µB is the Bohr
magneton, h is Planck’s constant and gF is the Land´e factor.
In ﬁgure 5 (c) and
5 (f) the applied magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the laser light ( ~B⊥~k) and parallel
to the pump laser polarization. Both outer dips are shifted 2∆ from the unshifted
centre dip. In ﬁgure 5 (c) the widths of the outer dips are 25% larger than the width
of the centre dip. This is due to spatial inhomogeneities in the magnetic ﬁeld. We
reduced the intensities of the pump and probe lasers but observed no change in the
width of the EIT peaks which implies that they are not limited by power broadening.
The experiments were repeated for σ+ and σ− polarization of pump and probe. The

structure and resonance widths were unchanged, although the peaks were somewhat
less pronounced.

4. Atomic Beam EIT

The spectroscopy of atoms in a metal vapour cell has the limitations of randomly
directed velocities (i.e. Doppler broadening), ﬁeld inhomogeneities and high collision
rates. To improve the resolution of EIT resonances measurements were made using
a collimated atomic beam. A schematic diagram of the set-up used with an atomic
beam is shown in ﬁgure 6. Ultra high vacuum is achieved in a glass cell which has
outer dimensions of 3x3x12 cm3 with a wall thickness of 3 mm. The anti-reﬂection
coated cell (for 670 nm) was wrapped in µ-metal to reduce stray magnetic ﬁelds.
Isotopically enriched 6Li atoms are evaporated from an oven at a temperature of
450◦ C to produce a thermal atomic beam. At this temperature the pressure was
2×10−10 Torr in the glass cell with an expected 6Li vapour pressure of 4×10−4 Torr
in the oven. The divergence of the atomic beam is 5.5 mrad and the diameter of the
beam at the centre of the probe region is 7 mm. Since the transverse Doppler width
was reduced considerably it was necessary to frequency stabilize the master laser by
actively locking to the crossover of the saturated absorption line. The pump and probe
frequencies for the EIT experiments were obtained using the same system of AOMs
used for EIT in the vapour cell. The pump and probe beams were overlapped on a
non-polarizing beam splitting cube and then expanded to a beam diameter of 18 mm.
Fluorescence from atoms in the probe region was detected using a photomultiplier
tube. The pump and probe intensities were 1.4 mW/cm2 for both beams.

4.1. Results

The collimated atomic beam showed a much narrower transverse Doppler width of
20 MHz compared to ≈ 3.5 GHz obtained in the vapour cell. Therefore, the hyperﬁne
splitting of the 22P1/2 state of 26.1 MHz can be resolved. Figure 7 shows a plot of
ﬂuorescence of the D1 line as a function of frequency diﬀerence. In this ﬁgure the probe

laser is tuned to the F

For this reason we performed all of the subsequent experiments with the pump laser

Figure 8 shows several EIT resonances obtained for various polarizations with
and without an applied B-ﬁeld (≈ 2 G) along the atomic beam. In 8 (a) and 8 (b) the
polarization of both lasers is linear and perpendicular to each other. The two outer
peaks in (b) are both shifted by 2∆ from the zero ﬁeld resonance which is consistent
with the allowed transitions depicted in (c). Orthogonal circular polarizations were
used for the pump and probe to obtain the plots in ﬁgure 8 (d) and 8 (e). With the
B-ﬁeld perpendicular to the laser, all transitions are allowed (ﬁgure 8 (f)) and it should
be possible to observe ﬁve dips (for which we only observe three), each separated by
∆. In (g) and (h) the polarization of both laser beams are aligned parallel to each
other and orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld. Only two Λ-systems are allowed in this
conﬁguration (ﬁgure 8 (i)). The two resulting EIT resonances are both shifted by ∆

This is a factor of 10 reduction compared to the vapour cell experiments. To get a
better understanding of the broadening of our EIT resonances in the atomic beam
we investigated the dependence of the width on the laser intensity of the pump laser,
as shown in ﬁgure 9 (a).
In addition, the amplitudes of the EIT resonances are
shown. Note, that the intensity of the probe laser is kept ﬁxed at 1 mW/cm2. We
observe a linear dependence of both the amplitude and the resonance width on the
laser intensity. The linear behaviour of the resonance width is expected when power
broadening becomes signiﬁcant (Agap’ev 1993). Extrapolation gives a low-intensity
limit of 190 kHz.

Additional broadening comes from the limited interaction time of the atoms with
the light ﬁeld (transit-time broadening). This was studied by measuring the resonance
width for diﬀerent laser beam cross-sections and the results are shown in ﬁgure 9(b). In

other.

our work the sum of the laser intensities was kept ﬁxed at 1.7 mW/cm2. A signiﬁcant
increase could be observed for interaction lengths smaller than 5 mm. However, for
a beam diameter of 18 mm used in all other experiments the broadening due to the
transit time is negligible relative to the contribution of power broadening and magnetic
ﬁeld inhomogeneities.

5. Ramsey Spectroscopy

Further reduction of EIT resonance widths was achieved using Ramsey spectroscopy
(Ramsey 1989). In this technique atoms or molecules in a beam pass two spatially
separated interaction regions. Optical Ramsey fringes were observed on beams
of Na and Cs atoms pumped into coherent non-absorbing states (Thomas et al
1982, Hemmer et al 1993).

Here, a coherent superposition of the F = 1/2 and F = 3/2 ground states is
prepared in a light ﬁeld. The laser ﬁeld consists of two co-propagating laser beams
which are resonant with the F = 1/2 → F ′ = 3/2 and F = 3/2 → F ′ = 3/2
transitions. After some time of ﬂight the state is probed in a second interaction region
consisting of the same two frequencies. Similar to the EIT experiments described
previously, the laser resonant with the F = 1/2 → F ′ = 3/2 transition is kept ﬁxed
while the other frequency is swept over the F = 3/2 → F ′ = 3/2 transition.

In our experiment the two interaction regions were separated by L = 7.7 mm.
This was achieved by using only one laser beam in which the complete central vertical
portion was blocked. Figure 10 shows a plot of ﬂuorescence as a function of frequency
diﬀerence. The intensities for both pump and probe were 2 mW/cm2. The polarization
of both beams were linear and perpendicular to each other. To amplify the Ramsey
fringes the laser light in the ﬁrst interaction region was chopped, while the ﬂuorescence
of the probe region was detected on a photo multiplier tube using a lock-in ampliﬁer.

Raman-type conﬁguration.

The obtained width (FWHM) of the resonance was narrower than 100 kHz which is
consistent with calculations based on a mean atomic velocity v ≈ 1600 ms−1 and
laser ﬁeld separation L; ∆ν = v/(3L) = 70 kHz (Demtr¨oder 2003).

6. Summary

We have reported high-resolution spectroscopy of 6Li using several techniques,
including saturated absorption, electromagnetically induced transparency in both
the vapour cell and atomic beam, and optical Ramsey spectroscopy. The saturated
absorption in an atomic vapour is limited in resolution by both the natural linewidth
of 6 MHz and the unresolved hyperﬁne splitting, but can be used as a frequency
reference for stabilizing diode laser systems. A frequency stabilized laser system with
precise frequency tuning in the range of the ground state hyperﬁne splittings was
used. Resonant light with two frequency components was used to form coherences
between the two hyperﬁne levels in the 6Li ground state for the ﬁrst time, allowing
absorption features as narrow as 200 kHz to be observed. The eﬀects of various
optical polarization conﬁgurations and applied magnetic ﬁelds were investigated,
and these were readily interpreted using conventional EIT theory. Additional EIT
experiments using a Ramsey type separated-ﬁeld geometry showed further reduction
in the resonance widths.

As an alkali atom with integer nuclear spin, 6Li presents an interesting system to
investigate coherence eﬀects such as EIT. Our initial investigations are consistent
with results obtained using other alkali atoms, such as rubidium and cesium.
Interesting eﬀects involving coherence spectroscopy may be expected for other
coherence phenomena such as coherences between Zeeman states within a hyperﬁne
level.

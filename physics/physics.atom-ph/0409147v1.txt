Radiative corrections to E1 matrix elements for ns

np transitions in the alkali metal atoms

lithium through francium are evaluated. They are found to be small for the lighter alkalis but

signiﬁcantly larger for the heavier alkalis, and in the case of cesium much larger than the experi-

mental accuracy. The relation of the matrix element calculation to a recent decay rate calculation

for hydrogenic ions is discussed, and application of the method to parity nonconservation in cesium

is described.

INTRODUCTION

High accuracy measurements of atomic lifetimes are diﬃcult, with only a few examples

of precisions well under one percent known. For this reason, consideration of radiative cor-

rections to lifetimes is usually not necessary. Until recently the most prominent exception

to this situation was the decay rates of orthopositronium and parapositronium, where de-

terminations of accuracy 180 ppm [1] and 215 ppm [2] respectively have been made.

In

these exotic atoms the radiative corrections start in order α with large coeﬃcients, and the

leading radiative correction are clearly visible, both because in these two-body atoms the

wave function is known analytically and because quantum electrodynamic (QED) correc-

tions start in order α with large coeﬃcients, giving contributions of 2.1 percent and 0.5

percent respectively.

In recent years, however, a new approach has been developed that exploits the fact

that the dipole-dipole potential between two alkali atoms, which goes as as C3/R3, can be

accurately measured, and C3 is proportional to the lifetimes of np states of the atoms. This

has allowed the determination of the lifetime of the 2p1/2 state of lithium as 27.102(7) ns

[3], the lifetime of the 3p3/2 state of sodium as 16.230(16) ns [4], the lifetimes of the 4p1/2

and 4p3/2 states of potassium as 26.69(5)ns and 26.34(5) ns [5], the lifetimes of the 5p1/2

and 5p3/2 states of rubidium as 27.75(8) ns and 26.25(8) ns [6], and the lifetimes of the

6p1/2 and 6p3/2 states of cesium as 34.88(2) ns and 30.462(3) ns [7]. (References to other

experimental determinations of lifetimes, some of which are of higher accuracy, can be found

in the above references. We note also that the lifetimes of the francium 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 states

have been measured as 29.45(11) ns and 21.02(11) ns using a diﬀerent technique [8].) These

high accuracies, which for matrix elements correspond at the best to 50 ppm, now make the

calculation of radiative corrections of interest, even though unlike the case of positronium

the corrections to E1 matrix elements are known to enter, for hydrogenic ions [9], in order

α(Zα)2.

There are two other reasons for carrying out calculations of these radiative corrections.

Firstly, this is a relatively unexplored region of QED. It has only been very recently that

the ﬁrst full calculations of one-loop radiative corrections to the decay rate of the hydrogen

isoelectronic sequence have been carried out [9]. That calculation was done by considering

the imaginary part of the two-loop Lamb shift, which is equivalent to calculating the shift in

2

the lifetime. Here we adopt a diﬀerent method, and instead calculate radiative corrections

to the associated transition matrix element. The introduction of this technique requires a

nontrivial modiﬁcation of the previous formalism, and also provides a check of that method.

The second additional reason for calculating radiative corrections to transition matrix

elements in the alkalis is the interest in parity nonconservation (PNC) in cesium [10]. Re-

cently a large binding correction to the Z boson-electron vertex radiative correction has been

found that has signiﬁcant implications for the standard model. The lowest-order radiative

correction,

α/2π, has been shown [11, 12, 13] to be enhanced through binding corrections

−

by almost an order of magnitude. However, the actual radiative correction is to the E1

matrix element of a 6s electron to a 7s electron, with an opposite parity component present

in one of these electrons induced by Z exchange with the nucleus. The full radiative cor-

rection calculation needed then involves the evaluation of the diagrams in Fig. 1, of which

diagram 1c, where the radiative correction is on the photon rather than the Z vertex, is of

the kind to be treated here. Thus the calculations on cesium that will be presented here will

be of use for this larger scale task.

We note that the methods used in this paper have previously been applied to calculating

the Lamb shift [14] and the radiative correction to hyperﬁne splitting [15] for the ground

states of the alkalis, where QED eﬀects larger than experimental accuracy were found.

However, the calculations remain untested because of the relative inaccuracy of many-body

methods (with the exception of lithium, where highly accurate variational methods are

available [16]). We will see that the same situation is present for alkali lifetimes, and thus

the present work provides yet another impetus to many-body theory to reach the accuracies

presently of interest for both radiative corrections and experiment.

In the next section, the generalization of the method used for the previous calculations of

radiative corrections in the alkalis will be laid out. Of particular interest are certain issues

related to the fact that the Gell-Mann-Low formalism for energies used in the past work

has to be changed because we are now instead dealing with matrix elements. In Section III,

the technique is applied to hydrogenic ions to compare with previous work, and in Section

IV the main results of the paper are presented. We conclude with a discussion of how this

approach can be made more accurate and how it can be generalized for application to the

calculation of radiative corrections to cesium PNC.

II. FORMALISM

through the formula

When one is interested in calculating energy shifts in atoms, Sucher’s generalization [17]

of the Gell-Mann-Low formalism provides a systematic way to derive them from the S-matrix

where Sǫ,λ is the S-matrix with the interaction Hamiltonian HI(t) multiplied by the factor

∆E = lim

ǫ→0, λ→1

iǫ
2

1
Sǫ,λ

∂Sǫ,λ
∂λ

,

λe−ǫ|t|.

The overall factor of ǫ is compensated by the fact that the S-matrix diverges as 1/ǫ. In higher

orders, factors of 1/ǫ2 are encountered in the numerator that are canceled by 1/ǫ terms

coming from expanding the denominator. When considering matrix elements the factor λ,

which accounts for a combinatorial factor speciﬁc to the Gell-Mann-Low formalism, will not

be used, but we continue to use the exponential damping factor ǫ, which will lead to the

frequent occurrence of what is eﬀectively the delta function,

Dǫ(x) =

1
π

ǫ
x2 + ǫ2 .

We replace the time-independent perturbation of Ref. [18] with a time dependent Hamil-

tonian in the length-gauge form appropriate for describing the absorption of a photon in a

electromagnetic ﬁeld of strength E0 linearly polarized in the z direction,

HLG = eE0

ˆze−iωt ψ(~x, t)a(~k, ˆz).

Z

·

We have made the dipole approximation, a good approximation for the neutral alkalis, so the
momentum of the initial photon, ~k, plays no role in the following. In addition we suppress

the factor eE0 in the following. We consider the matrix element of this Hamiltonian between

an initial state v taken to be a ns ate (2s for lithium, 3s for sodium, etc.) along with a

photon with energy ω, and a ﬁnal state w taken to be a np1/2 or np3/2 state with the same

principal quantum number n. It is important to keep the photon energy ω distinct from the
resonance energy ω0 ≡
taken before the limit ω

ω0. In lowest order, the S-matrix is then

In the following, we shall suppress the factor in square brackets.

being the fact that the eﬀective inﬁnitesimal factor used to obtain the energy conserving

delta function is 3ǫ. We then ﬁnd, after pulling out the factors mentioned above, a vertex

This expression has both ultraviolet divergences and reference state singularities that cancel

with the side graphs of Figs. 2a and 2c discussed below. The ultraviolet divergence is isolated

analytically by replacing both bound state propagators with free propagators, which gives an

ultraviolet divergent term along with a ﬁnite remainder we tabulate as Rwv(V; 00) in the ﬁrst

row of Table II. (We note at this point that we present results only for ns

np1/2 transitions.

Those for ns

np3/2 transitions should not be too diﬀerent for neutral systems considered

here, as radiative corrections to the lifetimes of the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states are essentially

the same for low-Z hydrogenic ions [9].) We then form the ultraviolet ﬁnite diﬀerence of
δzwv(V) and δzwv(V; 00) and evaluate it in coordinate space. A Wick rotation k0 →
is carried out, which passes poles: the separate contributions are tabulated as Rwv(V; iω)

tion of higher-order diagrams with two self-energies and a photon interaction show that even

more divergent terms going as, for example, Σ2

vv(ǫv)/ǫ2 are present that continue the Taylor
expansion. Thus this divergent term is not directly canceled as in the energy formalism but

instead can be ignored because it enters only as a phase [19]. However, the second term in

Eq. (18) does contribute a ﬁnite amount to the scattering amplitude,

δzwv(D) =

(22)

where we have included a similar term arising from the side-left diagram. The treatment

of these derivative (D) terms follows that of the vertex, but in this case we simply sum the

ﬁnite part of the free propagator term, the Wick rotated term, and the terms in which poles

are encircled and present the results as Rwv(D) in the fourth row of Table II. The ultraviolet

inﬁnite part of the derivative terms cancels a similar term from the vertex exactly, and the

reference states are allowed to cancel numerically. Finally, the two perturbed orbital terms

are listed as Rwv(PO; ns) and Rwv(PO; np) in the ﬁfth and sixth rows of Table II. The

sums of all contributions give the radiative correction results Rwv shown in the last row of

Table II.

III. HYDROGENIC IONS

In a previous paper [9], the imaginary part of the two-loop Lamb shift was used to

calculate radiative corrections to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 lifetimes of hydrogenic ions. In this

section, we redo the 2p1/2 correction for one of these ions using the present matrix element

formalism as a check of both approaches and to show the role of radiative energy shifts in

lifetime corrections. The 2p3/2 case included M1 decays, and so cannot be used for a direct

comparison.

(23)

An important feature of these corrections is that both radiative corrections to energies and

where we have used the standard values of the leading Zα-expansion contributions to the

1s and 2p1/2 Lamb shifts. At Z = 5, this contributes

0.064 to R(Zα). However, the

actual value of this function calculated in Ref. [9] was

0.014, so that a substantial positive

−

−

contribution of about 0.050 must come from the shift in the matrix element. We have

carried out this calculation using the techniques described above and ﬁnd a result of 0.025

for the function Rwv deﬁned in Eq. (8). This result is in perfect agreement with the expected

value, as it has to be doubled to account for the fact that the matrix element enters as a

square in decay rate calculations. But while this result shows the consistency between the

present matrix-element and the former decay-rate approaches, there is no improvement in

the numerical accuracy using our present method for these radiative correction calculations.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As found with our previous work on E1 matrix elements for hydrogenic ions [9], there

is a high degree of cancellation between contributing terms shown in the ﬁrst six rows of

Table II. This is due to the fact that radiative corrections to decay rates enter in order

α(Zα)2. In fact, if one puts the perturbed orbital contributions aside, the cancellation is

almost complete. As a result, the radiative correction is dominated by the (PO, ns) terms,

which are the larger of the two perturbed orbital terms. Since it is a standard practice with

the alkalis to derive matrix elements from observed lifetimes by dividing out the cube of the

experimental energy diﬀerences, we do not need to consider radiative corrections to energies

here, as they are automatically excluded in empirically extracted matrix elements.

The experimental accuracies for the alkali matrix elements are half the accuracies of the

lifetimes quoted in the introduction, speciﬁcally being 130 ppm, 490ppm, 940ppm, 1440ppm,

50 ppm, and 1870 ppm for lithium through francium. Comparing with the results of Table II,

we see corresponding theoretical contributions of 12 ppm, 39ppm, 149ppm, 488ppm, 606ppm,

and 2158 ppm. Thus these contributions are in principle measurable for several of the alkalis,

particularly cesium and francium.

9

For the case of lithium, the present approach is certainly less accurate than that avail-

able from nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED). The nonrelativistic lithium

wavefunction is extremely well understood using variational techniques [16], and the same

kind of NRQED calculations reported in Ref. [9] for hydrogenic ions can certainly be used

for neutral lithium. A nonrelativistic evaluation of the lifetime of the lithium 2p1/2 state

has been carried out in Ref. [20] with a result of 27.1045(14) ns which includes ﬁnite mass

corrections along with relativistic corrections. The quoted error came mainly from the fact

that the relativistic corrections were not directly calculated, and could be eliminated with

rigorous relativistic calculations. Regardless, the radiative correction calculated here is so

small that it should not make any diﬀerence to the theoretical lifetime in comparing with

experiment.

The cases of cesium and francium are more problematic because of the complexity of their

wave functions. A great deal of eﬀort has gone into treating these wave function accurately,

largely spurred by interest in PNC transitions. However, while experimental accuracy is now

certainly high enough for detection of radiative corrections of the size found here for cesium

and almost at the level needed for francium, further advances in many-body theory will be

required, as was the case for the Lamb shift [14] and the hyperﬁne splitting [15], before one

can decisively say this eﬀect has been seen. Incidentally, a theoretical advantage for lifetimes

as compared to hyperﬁne splittings is the relative insensitivity of lifetimes to nuclear eﬀects:

as emphasized in Ref. [15], uncertainties in the distribution of nuclear magnetism lead to

theoretical uncertainties that are diﬃcult to control.

A major spur to theoretical work on accurate cesium wave functions is the fact that the

observation of PNC in the atom [10] has signiﬁcant implications for particle physics. Before

the large binding correction to the lowest-order radiative correction

α/2π was found, a

−

discrepancy with experiment existed. As discussed in the introduction, a motivation for the

present work was to provide a basis for the full calculation of the diagrams shown in Fig. 1.

We note, for example, that diagram 1c is of the same form as the vertex diagram V in

Fig. 2b, with the diﬀerence that the 6s (or 6p1/2) state in diagram 2b must be replaced with

a perturbed orbital of the same parity which arises from the 6p1/2 (or 6s) state perturbed

by a Z boson exchange with the nucleus. Thus a relatively straightforward modiﬁcation of

the codes developed for the present calculations will allow the determination of this term.

In fact, with the exception of diagram 1e, the entire PNC calculations of Fig. 1 can be

10

treated as perturbations of either the weak interaction calculations [13], the self-energy

calculations [14], or the present transition matrix calculations. We are thus in a position to

carry out the bulk of the full radiative correction calculations. The fact that the previously

neglected radiative correction to the E1 matrix element is 0.261α/π as shown in Table II

makes it likely that the full PNC calculation will diﬀer quantitatively, though perhaps not

qualitatively, from the calculations that consider only the Z vertex.

Since the lowest-order results presented in Table I are substantially corrected by higher-

order eﬀects in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) [21], similar corrections can be

expected for the radiative corrections. The simplest way to account for these corrections

is to assume that Rwv, deﬁned as a ratio of the radiative correction to the lowest-order

matrix element, is valid when the lowest-order dipole matrix element is replaced with more

accurate results obtained with MBPT methods. As the size of the radiative corrections

is small, even if this is only roughly true, the basic size of the eﬀect would have been

established here. To attain more accuracy, a QED perturbation theory approach could be

taken. In that case, one would ﬁrst consider graphs of the type shown in Fig. 1 where the Z

vertex is replaced by interactions with other electrons. For even higher accuracy, one could

consider yet more complicated graphs with one absorbed photon, one radiative photon, and

two interactions with the other electrons: this is known, in the case without the radiative

photon, to give results within a few percent of the experimental answers [21]. Progress in

these large scale calculations, taken together with continuing advances in experiment and

many-body methods, should allow tests of the lifetimes of the alkalis at the level achieved

for positronium.

[19] The fact that the self energy also has an imaginary part associated with decay is under

further analysis; while this term would not cancel as a phase, in this formalism we note that

the states are stable at large positive and negative times, and this fact may justify neglecting

the imaginary part. See also the discussion in section 4 of U.D. Jentschura, C.H. Keitel, and

K. Pachucki, Can. J. Phys. 80, 1213 (2002).

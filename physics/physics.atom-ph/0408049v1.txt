In the present letter we solve a long standing problem with relativistic calculations done with
the widely used Multi-Conﬁguration Dirac-Fock Method. We show, using Relativistic Many-Body
Perturbation Theory (RMBPT), how even for relatively high-Z, relaxation or correlation causes
the non-relativistic limit of states of diﬀerent total angular momentum but identical orbital angular
momentum to have diﬀerent energies. We identify the role of single excitations obeying to Brillouin’s
theorem in this problem. We show that with large scale calculations in which this problem is properly
treated, we can reproduce very accurately recent high-precision measurements in F-like Ar, and turn
then into precise test of QED

PACS numbers: 31.30.Jv, 32.10.Fn, 31.25.Eb

Relativistic atomic structure codes, mostly Multi-
Conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) packages, are now of
widespread use in many sectors of physics, and the need
for reliable, relativistic calculations is stronger than ever
(see, e.g., [1] for examples in Astrophysics). However,
the diﬃculties of doing reliable calculations are numer-
ous, and still largely underestimated. For example a puz-
zle that was noted already twenty-two years ago [2] has
received little attention, and has never been solved, al-
though it may lead even in very simple calculation to
wrong energy values. In Ref.
[2] it was shown that rel-
ativistic self-consistent ﬁeld procedures do not produce,
in a number of cases, the correct non-relativistic limit
of zero ﬁne structure splitting when the speed of light is
tuned to inﬁnity. Ref. [2] suggested explicit calculation
of this non-relativistic oﬀset and subsequent correction
of the relativistic result as a remedy, although no jus-
tiﬁcation for the procedure was provided. Here we will
penetrate the origin of the non-relativistic shift using the
tools of perturbation theory and advanced MCDF calcu-
lations. We use these tools to show the role of relaxation
in the N.R. oﬀset, and prove that the inclusion of speciﬁc
mono-excitations in the MCDF basis removes it. We also
provide justiﬁcation to the subtraction procedure.

We will concentrate on the ﬁne-structure splitting in a
F-like ion which was used as a model system already in
Ref. [2] as accurate measurements have been performed
very recently [3]. With high experimental accuracy, even
for Z = 18, it is important to be aware of this prob-
lem which seriously aﬀects the comparison with exper-
iment on the present day level. Reference [3] does not
discuss this issue and it is thus unknown if the theoreti-

cal calculations performed there account for this problem.
We will further present accurate calculations of the ﬁne
structure splitting in F-like argon both with Relativis-
tic Many-Body Perturbation Theory (RMBPT) and with
the Multi-Conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method. It
is shown that by comparison with accurate experimental
results [3] it is possible to test the calculations on self-
energy and other radiative corrections in a true many-
electron surrounding.

With RMBPT the ﬁne-structure splitting in a F-like
system is calculated as the binding energy diﬀerence be-
tween the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 electron in the corresponding
Ne-like system. The lowest order approximation of this
binding energy is the negative of the orbital energy of
the removed electron in the Hartree-Fock approximation.
The remaining electrons are at this stage considered as
frozen in their orbitals in spite of the removal of one elec-
tron. The most important correction to this ﬁrst approx-
imation is then the relaxation of the electrons due to the
presence of the hole. The term relaxation usually denotes
the correction found by a single conﬁguration restricted
Hartree-Fock (or Dirac-Fock in the relativistic case) cal-
culation in the presence of the hole. The non-relativistic
shift has its origin already at this level and we will now
concentrate on this shift and postpone the discussion of
higher order corrections.

To analyze the relaxation contribution with perturba-
tion theory it is natural to start from the closed shell
system and systematically correct for the removal of one
electron. Two properties characterize a speciﬁc pertur-
bation expansion contribution; one is the order of the
perturbation and the other is the number of excitations.

FIG. 1: Illustration of the contributions entering in second
order perturbation theory. Diagrams(a-b) show single exci-
tations and diagrams (c-d) double excitations (correlation).
Downgoing single arrows denote core orbitals, downgoing dou-
ble arrows denote the hole and upgoing arrows denote excited
orbitals.

Fig. 1 shows the contributions entering in second order
perturbation theory. Fig. 1(a-b) show single excitations
and Fig. 1(c-d) double excitations. The relaxation, i.e.,
the eﬀects included by a single conﬁguration Hartree-
Fock calculation is in perturbation theory part of the
single excitations; the ones that preserve the one-particle
angular symmetry of the orbital being excited.

From now on we specialize the discussion on systems
with one (non-s) electron removed from a closed core like
F-like ions. In lowest order of the perturbation expansion
the correction of this type to the wavefunction for orbital
b is

ρrelax

where h denote the removed electron, the curly brackets
antisymmetrization and the minus sign is due to the re-
moval of h. V12 is the two-electron interaction, e.g., the
Coulomb interaction. The energy corrections are then
calculated as

(2)

In this way all types of diagrams in Fig. 1 (a-b) with
either orbital a = h or c = h and ℓs = ℓb, js = jb
are included, i.e., the single excitations that preserve the

2

angular structure.
It can be noted that the single ex-
citation contributions form a class of diagrams that can
be summed until convergence in an iterative scheme, see,
e.g., Refs. [4, 5]. Here we will not pursue this line, how-
ever, since our purpose is to analyze the relaxation in the
non-relativistic limit and show why a state with a hole
in nℓj=ℓ−1/2 and one with a hole nℓj=ℓ+1/2 do not reach
the same energy in this limit. For this it is suﬃcient to
study relaxation in second order.

As an example, take diagram Fig. 1(a) with orbital
a = h and ℓs = ℓb, a typical relaxation contribution. The
orbitals used to evaluate the diagram are solved using
the Hartree-Fock potential from the closed shell core and
the radial part of the 2p1/2 and the 2p3/2 orbital will be
identical when we let c → ∞. The problem comes instead
from the spin-angular part. Since

| ℓmℓ smsi = X
jmj

| (ℓs) jmjih(ℓs) jmj | ℓmℓ smsi

(3)

decoupling of spin and orbital angular momentum can-
not be done without summing over all total angular mo-
menta, j. An unambiguous way to see how this inﬂuences
our example of Fig. 1(a) with orbital a = h and ℓs = ℓb is
to compare the angular contribution non-relativistically
and relativistically. The electron-electron interaction is
expressed as

where k denotes the rank of the spherical tensor operator
C, which works on the orbital part of wavefunctions. Non
relativistically the angular part can be evaluated as

This is in fact identical to the following expression in the

That these two expressions give the same result can
be understood by standard angular momentum algebra
techniques.

In a restricted Dirac-Fock calculation there will be no
sums over intermediate angular momenta. Instead only
jh = jh′ is allowed, i.e., the hole is not allowed to ﬂuctu-
ate to the other ﬁne structure component, and jb′ = jb is
required , i.e., the corrections to orbital b do not change
its angular structure. The spin-angular part used is thus

which will clearly not produce the same result as Eq. 5,
and which further cannot give identical results for e.g.,
jh = 1/2 and jh = 3/2, which is easily seen from the
k = 2 contribution which is zero for jh = 1/2, but not
for jh = 3/2. The diﬀerence can also be readily demon-
strated numerically for a system as F-like neon where the
second order contribution to the relaxation gives an un-
physical ﬁne structure oﬀset of 0.024 eV in the c −→ ∞
limit. Following the recipe from Ref. [2] and correct-
ing the result calculated with the true value of c with
this oﬀset, we obtain a relaxation contribution to the
ﬁne structure splitting of −0.058 eV. After iteration of
the relaxation contributions the corrected value reaches
∼ −0.050, in line with the Coulomb relaxation contribu-
tion of ∼ −0.049, listed in Table I. This value has been
corrected using the same procedure. The small diﬀerence
is probably due to small diﬀerences in the classiﬁcation
of relaxation and correlation contributions.

The lesson here is that since the summation over all
possible couplings of spin and orbital angular momenta
of the intermediate states are necessary to reproduce the
uncoupled situation a correct non-relativistic limit can-
not be achieved with any single conﬁguration self consis-
tent ﬁeld calculation. In other words, still for the system
under consideration, one has to include more than one

3

conﬁguration relativistically to reproduce the single con-
ﬁguration non-relativistic result in a relativistic frame-
work.

With several conﬁgurations included it should in prin-
ciple be possible to reach the correct non-relativistic
limit, in practice one can, however, generally not achieve
this in a truncated calculation.
In practice the num-
ber of conﬁgurations has be be truncated for all but
the smallest systems. It is common for example, to re-
strict the calculation to double excitations from the dom-
inating conﬁguration, but just as double excitations are
needed to be added to the single excitations to obtain
the correct non-relativistic limit, triple excitations will
be needed to be added to corresponding double excita-
tions. One has to be careful in considering the mean-
ing of single and double excitation. For example the
1s22s22p43p is a single excitation in the LS coupling
sense. Yet in jj coupling it gives rise to 5 conﬁgurations
in the J = 1/2 case, two of which are double excita-
tions in the jj sense (2p1/22p4
3/23p1/2 and
2p2
3/23p3/2). With many-body perturbation theory
is is natural to start the calculation of the binding energy
of the 2pj electron with the closed shell Ne-like system
deﬁning the zeroth order Hamiltonian. The perturba-
tion, the full interaction with the removed electron, will
then be relatively large and it is deﬁnitely necessary to
go beyond second order to obtain good results even for
a relatively heavy system as F-like argon. On the other
hand the zeroth order Hamiltonian has a correct non-
relativistic limit by construction and it is easy to control
the excitations included during the perturbation expan-
sion. The MCDF method eﬀectively calculates the bulk
of the electron-electron interaction, but the price to pay is
a wrong non-relativistic limit. An unsolved question was
wether or not inclusion of a large amount of correlation
can alleviate this problem and reduce the oﬀset. In the
present work we have added to the original conﬁguration
all single and double excitations up to a given maximum
n and ℓ. We went from 3d to 5g for the case with a nor-
mal speed of light, and up to 6h for the non-relativistic
limit. This represents respectively 299, 1569, 4339 and
9127 fully relaxed jj conﬁgurations for the J = 1/2 case,
and 456, 2541, 7356 and 15915 for the J = 3/2.

The calculations are repeated with diﬀerent lists of
conﬁgurations. In one group of calculations, we include
all single and double excitation in the jj sense, except
for the single excitations, that should have a contribu-
tion only in the third order, as stated by Brillouin’s the-
orem [9, 10, 11]. Again we use here this theorem in the
jj sense, i.e., we exclude all conﬁgurations transformed
from the initial one by replacing an orbital with quan-
tum numbers n, κ by one with n′, κ, where κ is the
Dirac angular number.
In a second group we include
all single and double excitations. In both groups, we do
calculations once with only the Coulomb interaction be-

FIG. 2: Comparison of the non-relativistic oﬀset evaluated
with or without conﬁgurations obeying Brillouin’s theorem
for Be-like and F-like argon

tween electrons used in the evaluation of wavefunctions
and energies, and once with the full Breit interaction in
the evaluation of wavefunctions and mixing coeﬃcients.
This allows to include high-orders of the Breit interac-
tion in the calculation. In each group the Coulomb only
calculation is done also a second time with a large value
for the speed of light. The evolution of the N.R. shift as
a function of the maximum excitation used in the MCDF
process is plotted on Fig. 2, for both F-like and Be-like
ions, to show the generality of what is observed: the N.R.
oﬀset tends to a non-zero constant value when Brillouin
conﬁgurations are excluded, and to zero when all single
excitations are included.

The diﬀerent contributions to the MCDF result,
and the variation of the correlation energy and non-
relativistic oﬀset with and without Brillouin conﬁgura-
tions are presented in Table II. When comparing both
results, it is clear that subtracting the N.R. oﬀset and ex-
cluding Brillouin single excitations, or including Brillouin
single excitations lead to the same result. The agreement
with experiment and RMBPT results is excellent in both
cases, even though the quality of the convergence when
including Brillouin single excitations is not as good as in
the other case. It should also be noted that the evalua-
tion of the radiative corrections, the self-energy screen-
ing (SES) with the help of the Welton approximation [12]
leads to a very good agreement with experiment.

In conclusion we have proven, by comparing RMBPT
and MCDF results, that the N.R. oﬀset is due to relax-

4

ation and should go away when doing a complete calcula-
tion. We then showed that in the MCDF case, the oﬀset
is going to zero if a large enough conﬁguration space is
used, but only if Brillouin conﬁgurations are included. In
practice subtracting the N.R. oﬀset and excluding Bril-
louin single excitations lead to the same value, but nu-
merical convergence of the self-consistent ﬁeld process is
much easier in the former case. Finally, failing to account
for the N.R. oﬀset leads to poor results, even at a moder-
ately large Z, a fact that does not seem to have received
enough attention in many MCDF calculations.

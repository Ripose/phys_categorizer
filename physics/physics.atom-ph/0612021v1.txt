Recent progress in the spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium has allowed for measuring the separa-
tion between components of the hyperﬁne structure (HFS) of the (37, 35) metastable states with an
accuracy of 300 MHz, equivalent to a relative accuracy of 3.10−5. The analysis of the uncertainties of
the available theoretical results on the antiprotonic helium HFS shows that the accuracy of the value
of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton (currently known to only 0.3%) may be improved
by up to 2 orders of magnitude by measuring the splitting of appropriately selected components of
the HFS of any of the known metastable states. The feasibility of the proposed measurement by
means of an analog of the triple resonance method is also discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium is among the most spectacular examples of a successful fusion of
particle accelerator with low energy atomic physics methods for the study of the fundamental characteristics of an
elementary particle - the antiproton (see Refs. [1, 2] and references therein.) Among the main goals of the experimental
program of the CERN collaborations PS205 and ASACUSA are precision tests of bound-states QED (never performed
before on systems involving heavy antiparticles), the determination of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton
(currently known to only 0.3% accuracy [3]), and independent tests of CPT invariance. We focus our attention here on
the possibility of determining the antiproton magnetic moment with an improved accuracy by measuring the hyperﬁne
splitting and comparing the spectroscopy data with the theoretical calculations of the hyperﬁne structure (HFS) of
metastable states of the ¯p4He atoms [4, 5].

≥

In the non-relativistic approximation the bound states of ¯p4He are traditionally labelled with the quantum numbers
of the total orbital momentum L and the principal quantum number n, though an alternative labelling with L and the
vibrational quantum number v is also used; of course, n = L + v + 1. For the near-circular excited states with L in the
30 and small v the Auger decay is suppressed (Condo mechanism [6]) so that they de-excite only through
range L
slow radiative transitions. The life time of these states may reach microseconds; they are referred to as metastable.
The spin interactions of the constituents of ¯p4He split each Coulomb level into hyperﬁne components. The hyperﬁne
structure of the metastable state (nL) consists of 4 substates (nLF J), labelled (in addition to n and L) with the
quantum numbers F and J of the intermediate angular momentum F = L + se and the total angular momentum
J = F + s ¯p; here se and s ¯p stand for the spin operators of the electron and the antiproton. The spin interactions are
dominated by the electron spin-orbit interaction causing a splitting of the order of 10 GHz of the (nL) level into the
F± doublets with F = L
1/2. The splitting within the F± doublets is due to interactions involving the antiproton
spin, and is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller (see Fig.1).

The HFS of the (37, 35) state was ﬁrst observed in 1997 [7], when improved resolution allowed for clearly distin-
(38, 34) transition line. The peaks correspond to the d− and
guishing two peaks in the proﬁle of the (37, 35)
d+ transitions on Fig.1; at that time the components d1,2
± could not be resolved, and the remaining non-diagonal
components were too strongly suppressed to be observed [4]. The ﬁrst laser spectroscopy study of the HFS of the
(37, 35) state was performed in 2002 [9]; using the triple resonance method the frequencies of the m± transitions were
measured with an accuracy of the order of 300 MHz (below 30 ppm). The idea of the method was to depopulate
the F− doublet with a laser pulse tuned at the frequency of the d− transition, then reﬁll it from the F+ doublet by
applying an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld tuned at the m− or m+ transition frequency, and measure the reﬁlling rate with
a repeated laser pulse tuned at the d− transition frequency. In future measurements of the m± transition frequencies
the experimental uncertainty is expected to be further reduced. In what follows we are analyzing the restrictions that
theoretical and experimental uncertainties impose on the value of the antiproton dipole magnetic moment as extracted
from spectroscopy data, and outline an alternative approach to improving the accuracy of this value, possibly by up
to 2 orders of magnitude.

II. HYPERFINE STRUCTURE OF THE ENERGY LEVELS OF THE METASTABLE STATES OF 4HE

The spin interaction Hamiltonian V , used in the calculations of the HFS of ¯p4He in [4, 5], has the form of a sum of

to angular momentum algebra. The uncertainty of V is determined by the contribution of the interaction terms
of order O(meα6) and higher, that have not been taken into consideration. Accordingly, the relative uncertainty
∆qHi of the coeﬃcients Hi, due to truncating the expansion of V in power series in α is estimated to be of relative
10−4 [4, 5]. The uncertainty of Hi gives rise to the uncertainties δqEnLF J and δqν of

The dominating contribution to EnLF J comes from the electron spin–orbit interaction which does not depend of
the value of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton. The value of µ ¯p may be determined from spectroscopy
data about the HFS of ¯p4He if one selects hyperﬁne transitions whose frequencies depend as strongly as possible on
the value of µ ¯p. To help making the appropriate choice, we calculate the “sensitivity” of the hyperﬁne levels EnLF J
µp, for
and of the transition frequencies between them to variations of µ ¯p around the CPT-prescribed value µ ¯p =
9 metastable states that have been experimentally observed by now. We deﬁne the sensitivity S(F J)
S(nLF J) of
the hyperﬁne level EnLF J as:
S(F J) = ∂EnLF J /∂µ ¯p|µ ¯p=−µp
The sensitivity of a transition frequency is then the diﬀerence of the sensitivities of the initial and ﬁnal states, e.g.
S(s−) = S(F−J0)
S(F+J0), etc. The sensitivity values in Table III have been
calculated by numerical diﬀerentiation of the eigenvalues EnLF J of the spin interaction Hamiltonian. Because of the
opposite signs of S for the upper and lower sublevels in the F− and F+ doublets, the sensitivity of the s−, s+ and
m0 hyperﬁne transitions is enhanced, while the sensitivity of the m− and m+ transitions is suppressed by orders(s)
of magnitude (see Fig. 1).

fulﬁlled, the ratio ∆µν/∆qν is an estimate of the expected factor of improvement of the accuracy of µ ¯p. In other words,
the ratio ∆µν/∆νq is a criterium for selecting the hyperﬁne transitions that are most appropriate for determining µ ¯p.
A quick look at the Table IV shows that measurements of the s− and s+ transitions in any of the metastable states
would improve the accuracy of the experimental values of µ ¯p by a factor between 35 and 40. Measurements of the
diﬀerence X of m− and m+ transition frequencies in the (39, 35) and (34, 33) states might improve the value of µ ¯p
by an order of magnitude. No gain of accuracy is expected from measurements of the m± and m0 transitions.

FIG. 2: Asymmetric depopulation of the hyperﬁne states J− and J0 of the F− doublet.

III. APPLICATION OF THE TRIPLE RESONANCE METHOD TO MEASUREMENTS OF THE
HYPERFINE TRANSITION FREQUENCIES

The s− and s+ transition frequencies could be measured using an analog of the triple resonance method of Ref. [9].
Initially, the J− and J0 sublevels of the F− doublet (see Fig. 1) are equally populated. By applying a laser pulse,
− transition and de-tuned from the d2
tuned at the resonance frequency of the d1
− frequency, the J− and J0 sublevels are
depopulated asymmetrically. Symmetry is (partially) restored by resonance magnetic ﬁeld-stimulated s− transitions.
The fulﬁllment of the resonance condition is checked by means of a second, delayed laser pulse of the same frequency
as the ﬁrst one, intended to display any increase of the population of the J− sublevel. The expected diﬃculties in
such a measurement are related to the low intensity of the s± transition lines and to the overlap of the d1,2
− transition
line proﬁles that makes the eﬃciency of the asymmetrical depopulation of the F− doublet far from obvious.

The s−, s+ and m0 transition lines are much weaker than the m− and m+ lines, which were subject to spec-
troscopy measurements by the ASACUSA collaboration in 2002 [9]. Compared to the Rabi frequency νR of m−
(µBB0)/√6, the Rabi frequencies of s± and m0 are suppressed by factors of the order of L:
and m+, νR(m±)
2.10−2 is the mixing angle of the F±
νR(m0)/νR(m±)
components in the J = L hyperﬁne states (see Table II of Ref. [4]). Precision spectroscopy of the s− and s+ transition
lines would therefore require a longer measurement time and a stronger magnetic ﬁeld, oscillating with frequencies in
the 100 – 200 MHz range.

To get a quantitative idea of the discussed phenomena, we calculate the values of the detuning D that lead to
asymmetrical depopulation rates ratio q = 1.2 and q = 1.5, as well as the related power loss factor f , using the realistic
value 100 MHz for the FWHM of the laser proﬁle [11]. The collisional widths Γc were calculated for temperature
T = 6◦K and helium gas target number density 3
1020 cm−3 using the results of Ref. [10]. The numerical results
are presented in Table V.

We have shown that high accuracy measurements of appropriate hyperﬁne transition lines in the metastable states
of antiprotonic helium can help reduce the experimental uncertainty of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton.
An improvement of the current experiment measuring the m+, m− and as a consequence X, is being prepared and it is
expected to improve the accuracy on µ ¯p by up to a factor of 9. A larger improvement by a factor of up to 40 is possible
by directly measuring the antiproton spin-ﬂip transitions s+ and s−. The restrictions on the expected gain of accuracy
come from the diﬃculty to reduce the experimental uncertainty below the threshold δµν in Table IV rather than from
the limited accuracy of the Breit spin interaction Hamiltonian V of Eqs. (1)-(3) used in the theoretical calculations.
We have also outlined a possible experimental method for the measurement of the super-hyperﬁne splitting, without
discussing in details the feasibility of the experiment. We leave for future works the numerical simulations that will
answer questions about the restrictions on the experimental accuracy from the expectedly rather low signal-to-noise
ratio and about the possible use of a large oscillatory magnetic ﬁled in cryogenic helium gas target.

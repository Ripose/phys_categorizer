We describe the setup to create a large Bose-Einstein condensate containing more than 120·106
atoms. In the experiment a thermal beam is slowed by a Zeeman slower and captured in a dark-spot
magneto-optical trap (MOT). A typical dark-spot MOT in our experiments contains 2.0·1010 atoms
with a temperature of 320 µK and a density of about 1.0·1011 atoms/cm3. The sample is spin
polarized in a high magnetic ﬁeld, before the atoms are loaded in the magnetic trap. Spin polarizing
in a high magnetic ﬁeld results in an increase in the transfer eﬃciency by a factor of 2 compared to
experiments without spin polarizing. In the magnetic trap the cloud is cooled to degeneracy in 50 s
by evaporative cooling. To suppress the 3-body losses at the end of the evaporation the magnetic
trap is decompressed in the axial direction.

INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) 10 years ago [1, 2, 3], almost 60 groups built a
setup, in which this phase transition is achieved. The
setups lead normally to BEC’s containing 1.6·103 [4] up
to 3·107 [5] atoms depending on the atomic element and
the cooling technique.

In our setup we are able to condense more than 120·106
sodium atoms, which is, as far as we know, the largest
condensate made with a cooling strategy based on laser
cooling. In the hydrogen BEC experiment [6] a cryogenic
trap is used as a starting point for the evaporative cool-
ing. This allows orders of magnitude more atoms to start
with resulting in 1·109 atoms in the condensate.

In our experiment, where the condensate is used as
a source for superradiant scattering experiments, a high
number of atoms in the BEC is essential, because the cou-
pling of atoms to the superradiant scattered states scales
exponentially with the number of atoms in the conden-
sate. In this case a high atom number will give a strong
increase in the signal to noise ratio and allows for the
excitation of higher order modes. Furthermore, the high
number of atoms yields the possibility to enter the hy-
drodynamic regime.

In this article we will describe our setup and the tech-
niques to realize such a large condensate. We start with
a description of the ultra high vacuum (UHV) system,
which is essential for reaching BEC. In Sec.
III the
laser setup, which generates the laser light to control
and probe the atoms, is described. For the creation of
a BEC control of the experimental parameters is impor-
tant. For this a computer-controlled system is developed,
which will be discussed in Sec.
IV. The next section
covers the Zeeman slower in the zero-crossing conﬁgu-

ration used to slow the atomic beam down to 30 m/s.
Atoms from the slowed beam are trapped in the dark-
spot magneto-optical trap (MOT), as described in Sec.
VI. The atoms from the MOT are spin polarized in a
high magnetic ﬁeld before the transfer to the magnetic
trap (MT). This process is discussed in Sec. VII. In Sec.
VIII we describe the MT. Sec. IX covers the evaporative
cooling of the atoms. The large number of atoms give
rise to three-body losses at the end of the evaporation.
This problem is suppressed by decompressing the trap,
which is discussed in Sec. X. The imaging of the con-
densate is the subject of Sec. XI. Finally, we will give
the conclusions and the outlook of this work.

II. VACUUM SYSTEM

For the realization of a large atom number BEC it is
important to minimize the atomic losses during the cool-
ing process. One of the important loss processes is the
inelastic collisions with background gas atoms. This is es-
pecially important during the evaporation, which takes
a relative long time (50 s). For a lifetime of the cloud,
which is in the order of the evaporation time, the back-
ground pressure must in general be below 10−10 mbar. In
our setup the background pressure is below 10−11 mbar,
which is abundantly enough, as will be shown in Sec.
VIII. This ultra-high vacuum is reached by carefully
minimizing the beam load from the atomic source to the
background pressure and maximizing the pumping speed,
as described in the following.

Our setup (Fig. 1) consists of three main parts: the
oven, the Zeeman slower and the trapping chamber. The
ﬁrst part is a recycling sodium oven, in which 50 g of solid
sodium is heated up to 570 K. The ﬁrst chamber of the
oven consists of nw-35 conﬂat parts. The sodium vapor
leaves this chamber through a 6 mm diameter diaphragm.
The sodium beam enters the recycling chamber, which
consists of a conical adapter to nw-63. In this chamber,
atoms outside the well-collimated beam are removed from

2

the beam by an extra 8 mm diaphragm. To the recycling
chamber, a 6 mm internal diameter tube is welded, which
is connected to the bottom of the ﬁrst chamber, allow-
ing the sodium to ﬂow back to the ﬁrst chamber. The
relative large internal diameter of the ﬁrst part of this
recirculating oven is required to limit the pressure inside
this chamber, which attenuates the primary beam. The
second diaphragm is heated up to 383 K due through heat
conduction from other parts of the oven, which keeps the
sodium in the ﬂuid phase. We choose not to apply any
gold-coated stainless steel mesh either in this chamber or
in the recirculating tube, because wetting can be prob-
lematic for sodium. At the running temperatures the
50 g sodium lasts for 5000 hours without recirculation.
This is as long as we are using it until now, so no con-
clusion about the recirculation can be drawn at present.
The oven is pumped with a 1200 l/s diﬀusion pump to a
pressure of 4·10−8 mbar.

Helicoﬂex rings on both sides of the window to provide
a leak-tight glass-to-metal sealing. The leak rate of each
window is measured to be 7·10−11 mbar l/s. The to-
tal inﬂow in the BEC chamber including the beam load
out of the Zeeman slower is 6·10−9 mbar l/s. The BEC
chamber is pumped by an ion getter and titanium sub-
limation pump, mounted at a CF-160 port with a speci-
ﬁed pumping speed of 1000 l/s. From the pump towards
the trapping region the chamber has a conical shape to
minimize the pumping resistance (Fig. 2). With this
shape the actual pumping speed is likely to be close to
the speciﬁed pumping speed. Therefore, the inﬂow of
6·10−9 mbar l/s is compensated at a pressure of about
6·10−12 mbar, which is below the limit of our pressure
gauge of 1·10−11 mbar. The downside of this conﬁgura-
tion is that the thickness of the window and the conical
shape force us to put the coils further from the atoms
leading to a reduced ﬁeld gradient.

The second part of the setup is the Zeeman slower,
which is used to slow down the thermal atomic beam
[7]. This device will be discussed in more detail in Sec.
V. Regarding the vacuum system the Zeeman slower
consists of a 1900 mm long tube with a diameter of 50
mm yielding a conductivity of 8 l/s. One turbo pump is
mounted between the oven and the beginning of the Zee-
man slower and another pump is mounted in the Zeeman
slower 1300 mm from the beginning. This conﬁguration
leads to pressure of 1·10−9 mbar at the point of the sec-
ond turbo pump. Between the Zeeman slower and the
BEC chamber a tube with a length of 120 mm and a di-
ameter of 17 mm is mounted as a diﬀerential pumping
section yielding a conductivity of 5 l/s.

wide to maximize the pumping speed. The diameter decreases
towards the trapping region, because the coils must be as
close to the center as possible to create high magnetic ﬁeld
gradients.

III. LASER SYSTEM

The ﬁrst step in the cooling process towards BEC is
taken by laser cooling and trapping [8]. For this we need
laser light with the proper wavelength to drive a closed
transition. For sodium the transition at a wavelength
of 589 nm from the 32S1/2 to the 32P3/2 is closed (Fig.
3). For laser cooling the hyperﬁne transition from the
Fg = 2 ground state to Fe = 3 excited state is used. Due
to oﬀ-resonant scattering to the Fe = 2 excited state fol-
lowed by decay to the Fg = 1 ground state (separated by
1772 MHz) about 2 % of the atoms will be lost from this
transition. After 350 absorption-emission cycles, which
is only a small fraction of the cycles needed to slow down
a thermal beam, less than 0.1 % of the atoms are still in
the Fg = 2 ground state. This problem is circumvented
by re-exciting the atoms from the Fg = 1 ground state
with the so-called repump laser.

The BEC chamber is equipped with 9 windows for op-
tical access. All windows are mounted with aluminum

In our experiment we use for each frequency (cooling
and repumping) a separated laser (Fig. 4). The advan-

FIG. 3: The hyperﬁne structure of sodium. For laser cooling
transition from the Fg = 2 ground state to Fe = 3 excited
state is used. If an atom decays to the Fg = 1 ground state,
due to oﬀ resonant scattering to the Fe = 2 excited state, it
will be pumped back by the repumper.

tage of this system compared to setups, where only one
laser is used, is that we do not need optical power con-
suming elements to shift the frequency by 1772 MHz.
Both laser frequencies are produced by Spectra-Physics
380D dye-lasers. The dye-laser that produces light at
the laser cooling frequency is pumped with a 5 W solid
state CW laser (Millennia, Spectra-Physics) and gener-
ates 700 mW light. The other dye-laser, which is used for
the repumping is pumped with a 5 W argon-ion laser (se-
rie 2060, Spectra-Physics) and generates 500 mW light.
The cooling laser is locked to the cooling transition fre-
quency by frequency modulated saturation spectroscopy
[9]. For this a small percentage of the light is split oﬀ
and used for the spectroscopy. The light is divided in
two beams. From one beam the intensity is measured on
a photo diode after passing a quartz sodium cell. The
other beam is double passed through an acousto-optical
modulator (AOM). The frequency of this AOM is mod-
ulated with 6 kHz and an amplitude of 2 MHz around
a center frequency of 76 MHz. The +1 order of the fre-
quency modulated beam passes the quartz sodium cell in
opposite direction while overlapping the ﬁrst laser beam.
The signal from the photo diode is passed through an
lock-in ampliﬁer, where the ﬁrst derivative of the signal
is generated. This makes it possible to lock the laser at
a zero-crossing of the signal, which corresponds to the
maximum of the absorption in the sodium cell. The +1
order of the AOM is locked to the Fg = 2 to Fe = 3 tran-
sition. Thus the lock point of the laser is shifted by -76.0
MHz with respect to the Fg = 2 to Fe = 3 transition.

For locking the repump laser a Doppler-free bichro-
matic lock (DFBL) is used [10]. This lock has the ad-
vantage that no lock-in ampliﬁer and frequency modula-
tion is needed. The DFBL-lock is based on the satura-
tion spectroscopy, in which the laser frequency is locked
on the slope of a resonance peak. Locking on a slope
makes the frequency sensitive for ﬂuctuations in the laser
power.
In the DFBL-lock two orders of an AOM are
passed through a sodium cell generating two Lamb pro-

3

ﬁles. These Lamb proﬁles are electronically subtracted
resulting in a Doppler free signal with a possibility to
lock on a zero-crossing. The lock point can be tuned
by changing the AOM frequency or by using a diﬀerent
combination of orders of the AOM. We use the +1 and
+2 order of a 70 MHz AOM. This results in a laser fre-
quency of -77.5 MHz with respect to the Fg = 1 to Fe = 1
transition [10].

The lock point of the cooling laser is in principle inde-
pendent of the parameters of the laser, which makes it
the frequency reference of our experiment. Although the
lock of the repump laser is not sensitive for ﬂuctuations
in the total laser power, it does depend on the balance
between the two orders of the AOM. This makes the lock
sensitive for pointing instabilities of the laser. We mon-
itor this shift in the repump frequency measuring the
beat signal of the two lasers. Shifts in the beat frequency
are manually corrected by adjusting the balance between
the two orders of the AOM used for the DFBL-lock. The
beat also allows us to deduce the exact frequency of the
repump laser. The ﬂuctuation of the beat frequency is
less than 2 MHz, from which we conclude that the fre-
quency ﬂuctuations of each laser remains within 1 MHz,
assuming both lasers have the same stability.

FIG. 4: Laser setup before entering the optical ﬁbers. One
dye-laser is used for the generation of light at the cooling tran-
sition (lower one). This light is split in four beams: one for
the Zeeman slower beam, one for the MOT beams in the x
and y direction (splitting into two separated beams is done
after passing the ﬁber), one for the MOT beams in the z di-
rection, and one for the probe beam, used for the illumination
of the atomic sample. The other dye-laser (upper one) gener-
ates light at the repump frequency. This light is also divided
into four beams: one for repump light of the MOT, one for
spin polarizing the sample, one for the probe beam, used for
the illumination of the atomic sample, and a probe beam for
the atomic beam. The frequency diﬀerence of the two lasers
is monitored by beating the two lasers on a photo diode.

The detuning in the third column is given with respect to the
transition in the second column.

All laser beams needed for the experiment are con-
trolled by AOM’s. By adjusting the frequency and the
power of the rf-input of the AOM we have full control over
the frequency and the intensity of the laser beams. After
passing the AOM’s the light is transported through sin-
gle mode polarizing preserving optical ﬁbers (Fibercore,
HB600) to the setup. The ﬁber has a diameter of 125 µm
and a numerical aperture of 0.15. The incouple eﬃciency
of the ﬁbers is between 45 and 65 %, depending on the
qualitiy of the beam shape entering the ﬁber. In Tab. I
an overview of the detuning and the power after passing
the ﬁbers is given for all laser beams.

IV. SEQUENCING

For the realization of a BEC a large number of diﬀerent
steps have to be taken. The starting time and the dura-
tion of several of these steps is very critical. This requires
a computer controlled system that can switch and adjust
with µs-resolution the parameters of the experiment: the
AOM’s, the light and atomic beam shutters, the currents
through the coils, the rf-frequency, the rf-power and the
CCD-camera.

In our experiment this is done by programming a se-
quence on a computer and subsequently send the se-
quence to two National Instruments PCI-cards. The
cards generate the signals that drives the setup. The
digital and analog signals are produced by a PCI-6534
card and PCI-6713 card, respectively. The signals from
the digital card are used for switching devices on and oﬀ
at a 2µs time scale. The signals from the analog card
are used for ramping the magnetic trap up and down.
The rf-ﬁeld for the evaporative cooling is generated by a
direct digital synthesizer (DDS).

In Tab. II an overview of the timing of the diﬀerent
steps during the cooling towards BEC and the imaging of
the BEC are summarized. A more thorough discussion of
each step will follow in the remaining part of this article.
The clock of the experiment is an frequency shifting

V. ZEEMAN SLOWER IN ZERO CROSSING
CONFIGURATION

Our recycling oven produces a sodium ﬂux of 3·1012
atoms/s at a temperature of 570 K. This ﬂux is deter-
mined by measuring the absorption from a beam probe
at the end of the Zeeman slower. If we assume that the
velocity distribution of the atoms out of the oven obeys
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at a temperature of
570 K, only 0.02 % of the atoms have a velocity smaller
than 30 m/s, which is the capture velocity of our trap.
The loading of the trap can be increased signiﬁcantly by
predecelerating the beam in a Zeeman slower. In a Zee-
man slower the atoms are decelerated by a counter prop-
agating laser beam, while the changing Doppler shift is
compensated by a changing Zeeman shift due to an in-
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld along the deceleration path.
In the Zeeman slower the longitudinal velocity decreases,
but there is no cooling in the radial direction. The loss of
atoms due to this increasing divergence can be compen-
sated by placing the end of the Zeeman slower as close to
the trapping chamber as possible. In this situation it is
complicated to install a vacuum pump between the Zee-
man slower and the trapping chamber. Therefore, our
Zeeman slower is divided in two parts, where in between
the two parts a pump is placed. The pumping section is
passed by the atoms with a velocity of 200 m/s, so that
the beam divergence is still small at this point.

Other ways of minimizing the losses due to the diver-
gence is by using 2D optical molasses [8], a magneto-
optical lens [11] or a magneto-optical compressor [12] at
the end of the Zeeman slower. All of these options have
proved to be eﬃcient; however, they need extra laser
beams, which makes them in day-to-day operation less
favorable compared to our solution.

In Fig. 5 the calculated magnetic ﬁeld in the Zeeman
slower as a function of the distance from the beginning of
the Zeeman slower is given (solid line). The ﬁeld starts
at 1000 G for a capture velocity of 950 m/s. In the Zee-
man slower the atoms pass a region with a zero magnetic
ﬁeld. In this region the energy splitting of the magnetic
sublevels is not large enough to prevent oﬀ-resonant scat-
tering to the Fe = 2 excited state followed by decay
to the Fg = 1 ground state. Therefore, a repumper is
needed to prevent losses from the cooling process during
the passage of the pumping section. This repump fre-
quency is generated by passing the laser beam through
an electro-optical modulator (EOM) operating at 1720
MHz. The side band generated with the EOM contain
10 % of the total intensity. The EOM is placed after the

ber of particles in the slowed beam. The slow atom ﬂux
is measured with the beam probe to be 7·109 atoms/s.
Taken the divergence of the atomic beam due to the slow-
ing into account the slowing eﬃciency is determined to
be around 10 %. We have not yet fully tracked down the
reason for this sub-optimal performance.

VI. THE DARK-SPOT MAGNETO OPTICAL
TRAP

With atoms slowed down to 30 m/s, a dark-spot MOT
is loaded for 6 s. In the dark-spot MOT conﬁguration the
repump beam has a black spot in the center of the beam.
The spot is imaged at the MOT, where it has a diameter
of 12 mm. The atoms in the center of the dark-spot MOT
are optically pumped to the Fg = 1 ground state due to
the presence of only cooling light [13]. This prevents the
density limitation due to intra-MOT collisions in a bright
MOT [14, 15]. The light of the dark-spot MOT consists
of three retro-reﬂected laser beams (MOT beams) with
beam diameter of 25 mm and a detuning of -11 MHz
with respect to the Fg = 2 to Fe = 3 transition, and one
beam (repump beam) with a detuning of +2.5 MHz with
respect to the Fg = 1 to Fe = 1 transition (see Tab. I).
The quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld needed for the MOT is
generated by two anti-Helmholtz coils producing a ﬁeld
gradient of 5 G/cm at a current of 15 A. A typical dark-
spot MOT in our experiments consists of 2.0·1010 atoms
with a temperature of 320 µK at a peak density of about

proﬁle to much to get suﬃcient transmission through the
ﬁber (>45%).

Figure 5 also shows the calculated velocity of the atoms
passing the Zeeman slower (dotted line). We can see that
the ﬁnal velocity (30 m/s) is not reached until close to
the trapping region, which is a great beneﬁt for the num-

1.0·1011 atoms/cm3[16]. Note, that due to the slow atom
ﬂux of 7·109 atoms/s the MOT loads in a few seconds.

VII. SPIN POLARIZING IN A HIGH
MAGNETIC FIELD

After loading the dark-spot MOT the atoms are trans-
ferred to the MT for the evaporative cooling. The ef-
ﬁciency of this transfer depends on the distribution of
the atoms over the magnetic sublevels of the trapped
state. The sodium atoms trapped in a dark-spot MOT
occupy the Fg = 1 ground state. The homogeneous dis-
tribution over the three magnetic sublevels, makes that
only 1/3 of the atoms are in the ”low ﬁeld seeking” state
(Fg = 1, Mg = −1), which can be trapped in the mini-
mum of the magnetic trap. The Fg = 2, Mg = 2 state,
which can also be trapped in the minimum of the mag-
netic trap with two times stronger conﬁnement is not
investigated. It is harder to reach BEC with atoms in
this state, since only a pure Fg = 2, Mg = 2 state is sta-
ble against spin changing collisions. Therefore, all the
atoms in other Fg = 2 ground states must be removed
from the trap before evaporation [17].

The transfer eﬃciency from the MOT to the MT of
1/3 can be increased by spin polarizing the sample be-
fore loading it into the MT. This can be done by applying
a short laser pulse with the proper polarization in combi-
nation with a small magnetic ﬁeld to deﬁne the spin state
with respect to the magnetic trap (Fig. 6). Spin polariza-
tion is a commonly used technique in BEC experiments,
for example in the experiments with Rb [1], He [18], and
Ne [19]. In these experiments transfer eﬃciencies up to
0.70 are reached. To our knowledge in sodium BEC ex-
periments the eﬃciency has never exceeded 0.35 [17] due
to the large number of transitions lying very close to each
other in frequency in combination with the high optical
density. The ﬁnal degree of polarization is determined by
the balance between the optical pumping to the polar-
ized state and the depolarization. The depolarization is
caused by oﬀ-resonant scattering of the spin-polarization
beam by atoms, which are already polarized, and the re-
absoption of spontaneous emitted photons.
In sodium
MOTs used in BEC experiments the optical density is so
high, that these are strong depolarization mechanisms.
For sodium it is not possible to circumvent this problem
using a larger detuning due to the large number of optical
transitions, which are close to each other in frequency.

In our experiment we spin polarize the atoms in a high
magnetic ﬁeld. The high magnetic ﬁeld induces large
level splittings, which makes it easier to drive only the
transition needed for the polarization process. Further-
more, due to the large level splittings the optical den-
sity of the sample decreases signiﬁcant, which makes the
re-absorption of spontaneous emitted photons no longer
problematic [20]. The magnetic ﬁeld is created by a com-
bination of the ﬁelds generated by the pinch and bias coils
of the magnetic trap. The details of this trap will be dis-

Fg = 1 ground state are optically pumped to the excited
state by a laser beam with σ− polarization (solid arrows).
The atoms in the Fe = 1 excited state can decay back to the
Fg = 1, Mg = −1 ground states, making them spin polarized.
However, also decay to the other Fg = 1 ground states is pos-
sible, which makes another absorption-emission cycle needed.
An atom in the Fe = 1 excited state can also decay to the
Fg = 2 ground state. From this state the atoms are depumped
by the MOT laser beams back to the Fg = 1 ground state.
The diﬀerent decay possibilities from one excited state are

are not shown.

cussed in Sec. VIII. With these coils we can tune the
ﬁeld from 0 to 125 G with a accuracy of 1 G. Directly af-
ter the MOT magnetic ﬁeld and the repump laser beam
are turned oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld of the spin polarizing
is turned on. Note, that the MOT laser beams are still
on. It takes about 500 µs for the ﬁeld to stabilize. After
this time the spin polarizing beam is turned on for 500
µs. During spin polarizing the MOT beams pump the
atoms decaying to the Fg = 2 ground state back to the
Fg = 1 ground state. After spin polarizing these beams
are kept on for another 500 µs to make sure all the atoms
end in the Fg = 1 ground state. In Fig. 7 the transfer
eﬃciency from the MOT to the MT is given as a func-
tion of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁgure clearly
shows that spin polarizing in a high magnetic ﬁeld gives
a high and stable transfer eﬃciency around 0.7, which is
comparable to other spin polarization experiments. The
solid line in Fig. 7 gives the calculated transfer eﬃciency.
In this calculation the optical Bloch equations are solved
for the multilevel structure of sodium in a magnetic ﬁeld.
After elimination of the population of the excited state
rate equations for transitions from one ground state to
another ground state are obtained. These rate equation
form the bases for the calculation. A more detailed de-
scription of the model is given in Ref. [20].

MT as a function of the applied magnetic ﬁeld.

[21]. The trap is schematically shown in Fig. 8. The two
pinch coils generate a curvature in the magnetic ﬁeld in
the z-direction, which causes conﬁnement along this di-
rection. The oﬀset in the magnetic ﬁeld is compensated
by the bias coils producing a ﬁeld in the opposite direc-
tion. The gradient coils produces a quadrupole ﬁeld for
the radial conﬁnement. The advantage of the cloverleaf
trap is the full 360◦ optical access.

FIG. 8: Schematic view of the cloverleaf trap. From left to
right we see the MOT coils (transparent), the bias coils, the
set of four gradient coils and the pinch coils. Furthermore we
can see the ﬁne tune coils around the pinch coils.

We operate the gradient and the pinch/bias coils at
300 A and 200 A, respectively. The current of 300 A
through the gradient coils yields a magnetic ﬁeld gradient
of 118 G/cm in the radial direction. The curvature ﬁeld
in the axial direction is 42 G/cm2 at a current of 200
A through the pinch/bias combination. The minimum
of the ﬁeld is 3.4 G. This leads to trap frequencies in
the axial and radial direction of νz = 16 Hz and νρ = 99
Hz. The stability of the minimum of the magnetic ﬁeld is
essential for a reproducible evaporation. The minimum is
generated by subtracting the two relative large magnetic

7

ﬁelds of the pinch and the bias coils, which makes it very
sensitive for the current through this coils as well as the
position of the coils.

To minimize the ﬁrst eﬀect the current through the
pinch and bias coils is produced by the same power sup-
ply. In parallel with the bias coils a shunt is placed, to
ﬁne tune the current through the bias coils. The second
eﬀect is minimized by gluing all the windings of the sepa-
rated coils together with Loctite, subsequently both sets
of coils are ﬁxed in polyester boxes. The coils are made of
hollow, rectangular copper wires, through which cooling
water is pumped. The temperature of the cooling water
is stabilized within 1 0C. With these precautions the sta-
bility of the ﬁeld minimum of our trap is 0.4 mG. This
is determined by measuring the stability in the number
of particles in the BEC, when the atoms are cooled very
close to the bottom of the trap. The stability of the trap
is 500 Hz, which corresponds to 0.4 mG.

The switch-on time of the coils is less than 2 ms. Most
information from the cold atoms is obtained from time
of ﬂight images of the expanding cloud. Therefore, the
expansion of the cloud should be dominated by the dy-
namics of the cloud and not by the remaining magnetic
ﬁeld. This makes it important that the magnetic ﬁeld is
switched oﬀ fast on the time scale of the trap period (less
than 1 ms). To meet these requirements all the sets of
coils are equipped with a fast switch. Our switch consist
of a resistor and a diode, which are placed in parallel with
the coils, and an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT,
Dynex DIM600BSS17-E000) in serial to the coils. To
switch oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld the IGBT is opened. This
is done relatively slowly (50 µs) on the time scale of the
IGBT to limit the peak voltage arising during the turn-oﬀ
to 1200 V. This limitation does not increase the switch-
oﬀ time, because this is determined by the self induction
of the coils. The energy that is released from the coils
is absorbed in the resistor. Because a diode is placed
in serial with the resistor, no current ﬂows through the
resistor during normal operation of the magnetic trap.
To suppress the limitations in the switch-oﬀ time due to
eddy currents the amount of metal between the coils is
minimized. This is achieved by mounting large windows
(radius of 63.5 mm) in the vacuum chamber in the z-
direction (Fig. 2). The radius of the windows is twice as
big as the outer radius of the pinch coil. The switch-oﬀ
time of the coils is less than 300 µs (1/e time). In the ex-
periment we have increased the time to 750 µs, because
a switch-oﬀ time of 300 µs generates repulsive forces be-
tween the coils large enough to crack the polyester box
in which they are mounted.

After spin polarizing, as described in the previous sec-
tion, the gradient coils are turned on and the shunt is
closed, which changes the high bias ﬁeld used for the
spin polarizing into a curvature ﬁeld. The strength of
the trapping potential of the MOT and the MT must be
matched, so that heating during the transfer is avoided.
When the MT is much stronger than the MOT, this can
be done by turning the MT on slowly. However, in our ex-

periment we can turn on the magnetic trap immediately
at the full strength without problems of mode matching
the distributions of the atoms in the MOT with the dis-
tribution of the atoms in the MT. In the MT we can load
1.4·1010 atoms at a temperature of 350 µK with a peak
density of 5.0·1010 atoms/cm3.

In Fig. 9 the amount of atoms in the MT is plotted
as a function of the storage time in the MT. From the
ﬁt of the data to an exponential decay the lifetime of the
atoms in the MT is determined to be 260 s. This is long
enough for the evaporative cooling, which takes only 50
s. Therefore, we loose only ≈ 20% of the particles due to
the ﬁnite pressure.

increase rapidly with decreasing temperature [16].

For an evaporation time of 50 s we can condense 35·106
atoms in the setup. Even in 15 s we can reach con-
densation but with signiﬁcant less atoms. In Fig. 10a
the number of atoms is plotted as a function of the rf-
frequency relative to the bottom of the trap for a 50 s
ramp. During the evaporation the density increases to
3·1014 atoms/cm3. With a 3-body collision rate of G3 =
1.1·10−30cm6/s [24] this yields a large loss rate of G3 · n2
= 0.1 /s. The loss rate due to two-body collisions is given
by G2·n, with G2 = 6·10−17 cm3/s [25] and n is the den-
sity of the sample. This loss rate is small compared to
the 3-body lose rate. For the evaporation an eﬃciency
parameter α can be deﬁned as α =
[26]. The high
loss rate due to 3-body collisions results in a decreasing
α, as shown in the last part of the evaporation ramp (be-
low 150 kHz). In Fig. 10b the temperature of the cloud is
plotted as a function of the rf-frequency with respect to
the bottom of the trap. BEC is reached at a temperature
of 150 nK and a rf-frequency of 50 kHz.

IX. EVAPORATIVE COOLING

The atoms in the magnetic trap are cooled to degen-
eracy by evaporative cooling. The basic principle of this
technique is that the atoms with an energy higher than
the average kinetic energy are removed from the sam-
ple by spin-ﬂipping them to an untrapped state, followed
by rethermalization of the remaining atoms due to elas-
tic collisions [22, 23]. The energy diﬀerence between the
trapped and the untrapped state is given by µBB/2 cor-
responding to a frequency of 50 MHz at 70 G. The ﬁeld
for spin-ﬂipping is generated by a single-turn rf coil (di-
ameter of 21 mm) driven by a 10 W ampliﬁer. The coil
is placed outside the vacuum system between the win-
dow and the pinch coil at 40 mm distance from the atom
cloud. The rf-frequency is ramped down from 50 MHz
to 2.5 MHz in 50 s. The frequency in the ﬁrst 42.5 s is
linearly ramped down with a rate of 1.08 MHz/s; in the
last 7.5 s the ramp rate is decreased to 200 kHz/s. The
rf-power is kept at a constant level of 10 W during the
ramp. The rf-ﬁeld generates an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld
with an amplitude in the order of 10 mG. The probability
to make a transition from the trapped to untrapped state
equals ≈0.5 at the beginning of the evaporation and will

X. EVAPORATIVE COOLING IN A
DECOMPRESSED MAGNETIC TRAP

To reduce the losses due to 3-body collisions the trap
is decompressed after 42 seconds of evaporation, corre-
sponding with a rf-frequency of 2.04 MHz with respect
to the bottom of the trap. At higher frequencies and
thus higher temperatures 3-body losses are not the limit-
ing loss process, since the density is always below 2·1013
atoms/cm3 yielding a loss rate of 4·10−4 /s. For the de-
compression the trap frequencies can be lowered in either
axial or radial direction. In Fig. 11 the results of those
measurements are shown, where the radial and the axial
decompression reduces the trap frequencies from 99 to
50 Hz and from 16 to 4 Hz, respectively. Note, that the

radial decompression takes place in 2 directions instead
of only 1 direction in the axial decompressed case. This
means that the decrease in density is the same in the two
cases. The losses compared to the compressed trap are
strongly reduced by decompression. The evaporation in
the radial decompressed trap results in 60·106 atoms in
the BEC. This is increase of almost a factor of two com-
pared to the compressed trap. The number of atoms can
even be increased by a factor of four by evaporation in an
axial decompressed trap. In this elongated trap we can
condense 120·106 atoms. This is as far as we know the
largest atom number in a BEC starting from an optical
trap.

collisional opaque sample evaporated atoms have a larger
probability to escape from an elongated cigar shaped trap
without creating an avalanche than from a more spher-
ical symmetric trap. The collisional opacity is given by
hnri σs, with σs = 8πa2 the s-wave cross section, a the
scattering length, and hnri the average column density.
In our experiment the collisional opacity is 1.7, which is
signiﬁcant higher than the critical value of 0.693 [27] .

is typically imaged after 80 ms time of ﬂight, when the
optical density is between 3 and 5. The probe beam is 2.5
MHz detuned from the Fg = 1 ground state to the Fe = 1
excited state transition (Tab. I). The atoms can also be
probed at the Fg = 2 ground state after optical pumping
to this state, but this did not improve the quality of the
pictures. The length of our probe beam is 400 µs, which
is long enough for a good contrast and short enough to
avoid heating of the cloud.

To extract the absorption from the image we take after
the ﬁrst image at 1 sec intervals two additional images:
one of the probe beam without atoms and one of the
background. The absorption is determined by taking the
ratio of the image with atoms and the image without
atoms, after ﬁrst subtracting the background image from
both.

The absorption proﬁle is ﬁtted with a density pro-
ﬁle, which is the sum of Thomas-Fermi proﬁle for the
condensed atoms and a Gaussian proﬁle for the thermal
atoms. From the ﬁt three parameters for the condensate
are extracted: the absorption at the center of the proﬁle
due to the condensate (A), and the width of the Thomas-
Fermi proﬁle in the r- and z-direction (σr and σz). The
number of condensed atoms can be determined in two
ways: either by the total absorption or by the width of
the Thomas-Fermi proﬁle [28]. In the ﬁrst case the num-
ber of condensed atoms becomes N = (8π/15)n0σ2
r σz,
where the center density is given by n0 = (3A/4σr), with
r the radius of the BEC after expansion and σ the ab-
sorption cross section. For the Fg = 1 ground state to
the Fe = 1 excited state transition the absorption cross
section is given by σ = (3λ2/2π)Ceq and the square of
the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient becomes Ceq = 5/18. The
second method of extracting the number of atoms from
the images is to determine the chemical potential from
the width of the proﬁle. This is given by the relation:

µ =

mω2
r
rσ2

r t2 ,

with µ the chemical potential, ωr the radial trap fre-
quency and σr the Thomas-Fermi radius after the ex-
pansion. The number of particles in the BEC can then
be determined with the following equation:

XI. PROBING OF THE BOSE EINSTEIN
CONDENSATE

The atoms are probed by absorption imaging. For this
purpose the atoms are overlapped with a collimated laser
beam aligned perpendicular to the long axis of the trap.
The shadow caused by the cloud is imaged on the CCD
camera (Apogee AP1E, Kodak KAF-0401E chip). To
obtain information about the momentum distribution of
the atoms, the atoms are probed after a time of ﬂight
after switching oﬀ the trap. In our experiment the BEC

with a scattering length, N the number of atoms in the
BEC, and ¯ω the average trap frequency [28]. When the
used time of ﬂight is more than 30 ms both methods give
the same results within the measurement uncertainty.
After expansions shorter than 30 ms the high optical
density makes the ﬁrst method less reliable. In our ex-
periment we use the chemical potential for determining
the number of particles (second method), because this is
insensitive for ﬂuctuations in the probe frequency, while
optical density is.

With the decompression, as described in the previous
section, we can condense 120·106 atoms at a temperature

of 150 nK and a density of 2.8·1014 atoms/cm3. Axial
and radial size of the condensate is approximately 1 mm
and 20 µm, respectively. Evidence for the phase transi-
tion from a thermal gas to a BEC is the changing aspect
ratio as a function of the time of ﬂight (Fig. 12). Af-
ter a short time the cloud of atoms still has the shape
of the atom distribution in the magnetic trap, which is
elongated in the vertical direction in the pictures. This
aspect ratio changes due to the mean ﬁeld energy, which
causes the cloud to expand more rapidly in the direction
of the strongest conﬁnement. This eﬀect can been seen
clearly in our measurements.

XII. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

To summarize, we have realized a BEC of sodium con-
taining 120·106 atoms. This is as far as we know the
largest condensate starting from an optical trap. The
large number of particles is mainly due to two reasons
compared to similar experiments. First, we start with
a large number of atoms in the MT due to spin polar-
izing the sample before we load the atoms in the MT.
Secondly, we loose less than a factor of 120 in the num-
ber atoms during the evaporation. This relatively small
loss is caused by suppression of the 1,2,3-body losses dur-
ing the evaporation. The 1-body losses are strongly re-
duced due to the low background pressure, resulting in
a lifetime of the atoms in the MT of more than a factor
5 longer than the evaporation time. Furthermore, the
2-body losses and especially the 3-body losses are sup-
pressed by lowering the density of the cloud due to the
decompression during the evaporation.

The large number of atoms provides us the possibility
to do experiments such as superradiant scattering with a
better signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, the large num-
ber of atoms in combination with the low trap frequencies
gives rise to a high volume condensate. This in combina-
tion with the low density in the condensate compared to
similar experiments yields us the possibility to enter the
hydrodynamic regime.

FIG. 12: Absorption images as a function of the time of
ﬂight. Above each picture the time of ﬂight is given.
It is
clearly shown that the aspect ratio changes from the shape
dominated by the trap potential (elongated in the vertical
direction) to the shape dominated by the mean ﬁeld energy
(elongated in the horizontal direction).

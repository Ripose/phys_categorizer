We present calculations of spin-relaxation rates of alkali-metal atoms due to the spin-axis in-
teraction acting in binary collisions between the atoms. We show that for the high-temperature
conditions of interest here, the spin relaxation rates calculated with classical-path trajectories are
nearly the same as those calculated with the distorted-wave Born approximation. We compare these
calculations to recent experiments that used magnetic decoupling to isolate spin relaxation due to
binary collisions from that due to the formation of triplet van-der-Waals molecules. The values of
the spin-axis coupling coeﬃcients deduced from measurements of binary collision rates are consistent
with those deduced from molecular decoupling experiments. All the experimental data is consistent
with a simple and physically plausible scaling law for the spin-axis coupling coeﬃcients.

I. INTRODUCTION

Spin-exchange optical pumping [1,2] of 3He uses spin-exchange collisions between 3He atoms and optically pumped
Rb atoms to produce large quantities of highly spin-polarized 3He for a variety of applications, including medical
imaging [3] and spin-polarized targets [4]. The eﬃciency of polarized 3He production is determined by two fundamental
rates: the Rb-He spin-exchange rate and the Rb spin-relaxation rate. The measured spin-exchange rates [5] are in
fairly good agreement with theory [6]. At the high temperatures needed for the 3He spin-exchange rates to exceed
the wall relaxation rates, both Rb-Rb and Rb-He relaxation limit the eﬃciency for spin-exchange. While collisions
between alkali atoms nominally conserve the spin-polarization, Bhaskar et al. [7] discovered that rapid spin-relaxation
occurs in high-density optically pumped Cs, with a surprisingly large inferred spin-relaxation cross section in excess
of 1 ˚A2. The corresponding cross section for Rb-Rb relaxation [5,8–10], while smaller, still limits the eﬃciency of
3He production. The yet smaller cross section for K-K [8,11] relaxation suggests that, if technical diﬃculties are
surmounted, K may be the optimum partner for spin-exchange with 3He [5].

A few years ago, we discovered that 1/2 to 2/3 of the alkali-alkali relaxation decouples in magnetic ﬁelds of a few
kG [10], making implausible the interpretation of the relaxation exclusively in terms of binary collisions. Recently,
careful magnetic decoupling studies in low pressure, isotopically pure Rb and Cs samples deﬁnitively identiﬁed the
source of the ﬁeld-dependent relaxation as the spin-axis interaction in triplet molecules [12]. The remaining alkali-
alkali relaxation mechanism at high pressure is then presumably from binary collisions. It is the purpose of this paper
to show that the deduced values of the spin-axis interaction from binary collisions are consistent with the values
recently obtained from magnetic decoupling studies of triplet molecules [12]. We hypothesize a simple scaling law
for the second-order spin-orbit interaction that explains the relative magnitudes of the observed spin-axis interaction
strengths. Nevertheless, the measured cross sections are in every case at least a factor of 10 larger than would
be expected from ab initio calculations [13]. Table I contains a summary of the existing data on alkali-alkali spin
relaxation.

The spin-axis interaction between two alkali-metal atoms is

V1 =

2λ
3

S · (3ζζ − 1) · S .

(1)

Here the total electron spin of the valence-electron pair is S, R is the internuclear separation, and ζ is a unit vector
lying along the direction of the internuclear axis. The coeﬃcient λ = λ(R), a rapidly decreasing function of R, is
currently believed to arise from both the direct spin-dipolar coupling (averaged over the electron charge distribution)
and the spin-orbit interaction in second order [13]. Accumulating evidence, using both high temperature [12,14] and
low temperature experiments [15], suggests that the predicted spin-axis coupling (presumably arising almost entirely
from second-order, spin-orbit interactions) is too small in Cs by a factor of 3 to 4, and in Rb by a factor of more
than 10 [12]. Put another way, the theoretical spin-relaxation cross-sections for Rb are smaller than experiment by a
factor of more than 50.

This paper carefully documents how the collisional averaging of the interaction (1) leads to a spin relaxation rate.
The somewhat complicated averaging can be done exactly within the limitations of the classical path approximation,

so the origin of the discrepancy cannot be due to any inadequacies of the averaging but must lie with the potential (1),
or with the spin-independent interatomic potential which describes the classical paths, or with the neglect of some
unknown collisional relaxation mechanisms other than sudden binary collisions. For very cold collisions, where not so
many partial waves are involved, one could use the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) [18] to account for
any limitations of the classical-path method, but at the temperatures of interest here, as we will show, the results of
the classical path approximation are within a few percent of those of the DWBA.

Our recent experiments have studied the spin-relaxation rates as a function of magnetic ﬁeld for the three alkali
atoms K, Rb, and Cs, as described in Refs. [10,12,16,17]. We assume here that the remaining alkali density dependent
contributions to the relaxation rate at 12 kG arise entirely from binary collisions. The data are summarized in Table I.

II. CLASSICAL PATHS

In a binary collision at temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin many partial waves contribute to spin-exchange
relaxation, so a classical-path treatment should be adequate. Methods for averaging over all classical-path cross
sections to obtain spin relaxation rates were given in an earlier paper by Walter et al. [19] (referred to in the following
as WHW) for collisions between alkali-metal atoms and noble-gas atoms.
In particular, the anistropic magnetic
hyperﬁne interaction between the spin of a noble gas nucleus and the electron spin of the alkali-metal atom, Eq. (3)
of WHW has the same tensor symmetry as the spin-axis interaction (1), and the detailed calculations are so closely
analogous to those of WHW that we will simply summarize the results here.

As outlined in WHW and illustrated by Fig. 1 of that paper, we can assume that the orbit of the colliding pair
follows a trajectory governed by the triplet potential V0 = V0(R). The time-dependence of the internuclear separation
R can be found from the equation describing conservation of energy and angular momentum,

dR
dt

= ±wr1 −

b2
R2 −

2V0
M w2 .

(2)

Here M is the reduced mass of the pair of colliding alkali-metal atoms. For the relatively high-temperature exper-
imental conditions of interest here, possible changes in direction of the electron spin S cause such small changes in
the energy or angular momentum of the orbital motion that we can neglect them and parametrize the orbital energy
with the initial relative velocity w and the angular momentum by the impact parameter b.

It is convenient to let the time of closest approach of the pair be t = 0, so the orbital angle at time t is

ψ = ψ(t) = cos−1 ζ(t) · ζ(0).

(3)

The time dependence of the orbital angle can be found by numerical quadrature of the equation for conservation of
angular momentum

The rate coeﬃcient can be readily calculated by methods analogous to those used in WHW for relaxation due to
the anisotropic magnetic dipole hyperﬁne interaction. The average over all angles of the collisions can be carried out
analytically and we ﬁnd in analogy to (33) of WHW,

spin-axis coupling coeﬃcient λ and the orbital angle ψ are functions of time t, obtained from numerical integration
of Equations (2) and (4). Since ψ(−t) = −ψ(t), d2m(ψ) is an even function of t if m is even and odd if m is odd.
Also λ is an even function of t (measured from the time of closest approach), so φ2m is identically zero if m = ±1.
In practice, the rapid decrease of λ with increasing internuclear separation r means that φ2,±2 is so small as to be
negligible in practice. The variable of integration for (8) is more conveniently chosen to be ψ rather than t, since the
range of integration is then between ﬁnite rather than inﬁnite limits.

III. PARTIAL WAVES

We can also calculate the spin relaxation due to the spin-axis interaction (1) by the distorted-wave Born approxi-
mation (DWBA), outlined by Newbury et al. [18], which we refer to as Newbury in this section. According to (47) of
Newbury, the rate coeﬃcient corresponding to (6) is

For the high-temperature conditions of interest here the three matrix elements λll′ for spin-ﬂip scattering from an
initial wave of angular momentum l to a ﬁnal wave of angular momentum l′ = l, l ± 2 are nearly equal. We have
assumed exact equality to reduce the double sum on l and l′ to a single sum on l in (9).

The classical initial relative velocity w is related to the asymptotic spatial frequency k of the scattered wave by

w =

(10)

In (9), the integral over impact parameters b which occurs in the classical-path expression (6) is replaced by a sum
over partial waves l. The matrix element of the spin-axis coupling coeﬃcient between partial waves l and l′ is

Numerical solutions to the diﬀerential equations (2) and (12) are readily obtained. We have conﬁrmed that relation
(15) is indeed true, establishing the equivalence of the classical-path and partial-wave methods of calculating the spin-
relaxation rate coeﬃcients. Although the two methods give the same results, the classical-path approach is much less
numerically intensive, requiring only the solution of the simple ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations (2) and (4), whereas
the partial-wave analysis requires solving the second-order equation (12), with rapidly oscillating solutions.

IV. COMPARISON OF AB INITIO CALCULATIONS TO EXPERIMENT

In the context of ultracold collisions, Mies et al. [13] recently published ab initio calculations of λ, as the sum of

two contributions

λ = λSO + λDD .

(17)

For the heavier alkali-metal atoms, and for small R, they found that second-order spin-orbit interactions, represented
in (17) by λSO , were much larger than the term λDD , which describes the direct interaction between the magnetic
moments of the two valence electrons. Second-order contributions analogous to those responsible for λSO are well
known from the theoretical literature on molecular spectroscopy [21,22]. Mies et al. parameterize their calculations
of λ as follows (we have converted their results from atomic units):

λ =

Sµ2
3g2
B
4a3

B (cid:20)Ce−β(R−RS) −(cid:16) aB

R (cid:17)3(cid:21) .

(18)

Here aB is the Bohr radius, µB is the Bohr magneton and gS = 2.00232 is the electronic g-factor. The results (18) of
the ab initio calculations are parametrized as follows: for Rb, RS = 5.292 ˚A, C = .001252 and β = 1.84 ˚A−1; for Cs,
RS = 5.292 ˚A, C = .02249 and β = 1.568 ˚A−1. The ﬁrst term in (18) represents λSO . The second term,

λDD = −

Sµ2
3g2
B
4R3

,

(19)

represents the magnetic interaction of electrons, taken as point particles separated by a distance R. This is an excellent
approximation at very large R, but as we show below, it is not a very good approximation at smaller values of R
where the most important contributions to spin relaxation occur.

Table I shows cross-sections calculated as described in Sections II and III. For K, we assume only the classical
spin-dipolar term, because the spin-orbit contribution estimated by scaling from Mies et al. [13] is negligible. As can
be seen from Table I, the theoretical estimates are smaller than experiment by about a factor of 10 for Cs and K, and
a factor of almost 60 for Rb where the ab initio calculations predict that λ goes to zero at R = 5.5 ˚A.

In order to describe the eﬀects of spin-relaxation in a number of experiments on Cs, where (18) predicts relaxation
rates that are much too small, the NIST group has chosen to multiply λSO (the computed contribution to λ from
second-order spin-orbit interactions) by a constant value. This assumes that the R-dependence of the calculation is
correct [14,15]. Guided by new experimental data, we will discuss similar scaling arguments in Section VI.

V. EFFECTS OF WAVEFUNCTION OVERLAP ON λDD

The expression (19) of λDD by Mies et al. neglects the spatial distribution of the electron charge. In this section
we present a simple estimate of the eﬀect of the spatial distribution. We ﬁnd that neglect of the spatial distribution
cannot be responsible for the discrepancy between experiment and theory.

A simple estimate of the wavefunction |Ψi = ψ(r1, r2) |χi of the triplet state of an alkali dimer is

|Ψi = N [ϕA(1)ϕB(2) − ϕB(1)ϕA(2)] |χi

(20)

where, for example, ϕA(1) is a spatial orbital for electron 1 centered at nucleus A, N a normalizing factor, and |χi is
a three-component spinor representing the triplet spin state. The matrix element between a ﬁnal triplet state |Ψf i
and an initial triplet state |Ψii of the electronic magnetic dipole interaction (at ﬁxed R), is

(22)

We make the simplifying assumption that ϕA and ϕB can be approximated by the ground-state wavefunction of the
valence electron of an isolated alkali-metal atom.

The results are shown in Fig. 2. The principle eﬀect of the wavefunction overlap is to reduce the value of λDD
as compared to the point dipole approximation, and to reduce the predicted ab initio cross section for Rb-Rb to
5.3 × 10−20 cm2, increasing the experiment/theory discrepency. Obviously, it would be good to use better electron
wave functions than the simple form (20) used for this estimate, but we doubt that the results would change by the
orders of magnitude needed to obtain agreement with experiment.

VI. SCALING RELATION FOR λSO

In this section we show that the spin-axis coupling coeﬃcients deduced from triplet molecules are consistent with
a simple and plausible scaling relation that, in turn, accurately predicts the relative binary spin-relaxation cross

sections. Clearly, the contribution λDD from the direct interaction of the magnetic dipole moments of the electrons is
much too small to account for observed relaxation rates in the heavier alkali-metal atoms. The additional contribution
λSO calculated by Mies et al. is also too small. In the absence of any fundamental understanding of why the ab initio
calculations work so poorly, we shall assume that Mies et al. have correctly identiﬁed the second-order spin-orbit
interaction as a major contributor to λ, which implies that λSO should be proportional to the square of the P1/2–
P3/2 ﬁne structure splitting ∆ν, and inversely proportional to the valence-electron binding energy E, as predicted by
perturbation theory. To obtain the radial dependence of λSO , we shall make the physically plausible assumption that
it scales as |φ(r)|2, the valence electron density of an unperturbed alkali-metal atom at a distance r from the nucleus.
(The radial dependence of the values of λSO calculated by Mies et al. is very nearly that of |φ(r)|2.) Thus our scaling
law is

λSO = Ω

(hc∆ν)2

E

|φ(r)|2

.

(23)

The ﬁne structure splittings ∆ν for Cs, Rb, and K are 554 cm−1, 237.6 cm−1, and 57.7 cm−1, respectively; the binding
energies E are 3.89 eV, 4.18 eV, and 4.34 eV.

For the required wavefunctions φ(r), we use the asymptotic expansion of the Coulomb wave function [25], namely

φ(r) =

N

r (cid:18) 2r

n∗(cid:19)n∗

e−r/n∗

,

(24)

where the radius r is measured in Bohr radii aB. The eﬀective principal quantum number n∗ of the valence electron
in its ground state is related to the ionization energy E (in eV) and the Rydberg R∞ = 13.61 eV by n∗ = (R∞/E)1/2,
and the normalization factor N is given by N = [(4π)1/2(n∗)3/2Γ(n∗)]−1, where Γ(x) is the Euler gamma function.

The universal constant Ω of (23), which has units of volume, is deduced from experiments as follows. Recent
experimental studies [12] of the Cs spin relaxation in triplet dimers yield a spin-axis coupling |λCs/h| = 2.79 GHz.
This value reﬂects a thermal average over the rovibrational states of the triplet molecules, but for simplicity we will
take it to be the value of λ/h at the Cs triplet dimer equilibrium internuclear separation of R = 12 aB, whence, by
Eqs. (17) and (19), λCs

SO = 2.94 GHz. Thus, using |φ|2 = 3.48 × 10−6 a−3

B at R = 12 aB, we obtain

Ω = 2876 a3

B ,

(25)

roughly an atomic volume.

In Rb, the equilibrium internuclear separation for triplet molecules is R = 11.5 aB, where |φ|2 = 3.23 × 10−6 a−3
B ,
whence Eqs. (23) and (19) yield λRb/h = 294 MHz, in close agreement with the value |λRb/h| = 290 MHz deduced
from the observation of spin-relaxation due to Rb triplet dimers [12].

Using the results of Sections II and III and the spin-axis coupling coeﬃcients deduced from the above simple
arguments, we may readily compute the spin relaxation due to the spin-axis interaction in binary collisions between
alkali-metal atoms. The calculated cross sections for K-K, Rb-Rb and Cs-Cs at 400 K, using the well-known ab initio
interatomic potentials of Krauss and Stevens [23] to compute the needed trajectories, are respectively 4.4 × 10−20 cm2,
1.4 × 10−18 cm2 and 1.1 × 10−16 cm2. As can be seen from Table I, these values agree well with experiment. We note
that for potassium—unlike rubidium and cesium—it is the dipole-dipole interaction that dominates the contribution
to λ, and so the larger discrepancy with experiment for K is probably due to the simpliﬁed estimate (19) of λDD .

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown here that the strength of the spin-axis coupling deduced from measurements of binary collisions
between alkali atoms is consistent with the values deduced from magnetic decoupling of relaxation due to formation
of weakly bound triplet molecules. The deduced spin-axis coupling strengths are much larger than predicted by ab
initio theory. Clearly more reliable theoretical ways to estimate the spin-axis coupling are needed.

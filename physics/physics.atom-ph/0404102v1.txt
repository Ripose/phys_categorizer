The oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne interaction between the 6p1/2 and 6p3/2 states in 133Cs is evaluated in
third-order MBPT giving 37.3 Hz and 48.3 Hz, respectively, for second-order energies of the 6p3/2
F = 3 and F = 4 levels. This result is a factor of 10 smaller than one obtained from an uncorrelated
ﬁrst-order Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculation and used in the analysis of a recent high-precision (≤ 2
kHz) measurement of the 6p3/2 hyperﬁne structure [Gerginov et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 72301
(2003)]. The factor of 10 diﬀerence has negligible eﬀect on the conclusions of the recent experiment
but will become important for experiments carried out at a precision of better than 1 kHz.

INTRODUCTION

II. PERTURBATION EXPANSION

In the recent study of the hyperﬁne structure of the
6p3/2 state of 133Cs by Gerginov et al. [1], intervals be-
tween hyperﬁne levels were measured to an accuracy
of ≤ 2 kHz, which was suﬃcient to give, for the ﬁrst
time, a non-zero value for the c hyperﬁne constant. The
value of the nuclear octupole moment of 133Cs obtained
from c was Ω = 0.82(10) b × µN , which is about a
factor of 40 larger than nuclear shell-model prediction
Ωn.s.m = 0.022 b × µN , motivating a re-examination of
corrections to the hyperﬁne constants. One such correc-
tion is the second-order hyperﬁne interaction between the
6p3/2 and 6p1/2 states. An estimate of this correction,
based on an independent particle model of the cesium
atom, was used in [1].
In the present work, we carry
out a detailed third-order MBPT calculation and obtain
corrections to the 6p3/2 hyperﬁne levels that are a factor
of 10 smaller than the values used in [1]. Revised val-
ues of the hyperﬁne constants a, b, and c, obtained using
the present results for the second-order hyperﬁne ener-
gies agree with those reported in [1] to within the error
estimates. However, for future experiments, especially
experiments aimed at a precision of better than 1 kHz,
it will be important to use the correlated values of the
corrections presented here, rather than the larger values
given in [1].

For the state |1i = |6p3/2i of Cs, the second-order hy-
perﬁne energy is dominated by the single state |ni =

this state is the one associated with the magnetic dipole
term k = k′ = 1. After angular reduction, the second-
order energy is

Contributions to the second-order energy from the nu-
clear quadrupole moment have been evaluated in low-
est order and found to change the values obtained from
Eq. (5) by less than 1%. The ﬁne-structure interval
E1 − E2 in the denominator is determined as the diﬀer-
ence between fD2 the centroid of the 6s 2S1/2 → 6p 2P3/2
transition [2, 3] and fD1 the centroid of the 6s 2S1/2 →
6p 2P1/2 transition [4], both of which have been measured
to high precision. One obtains E1 − E2 = fD2 − fD1 =
1.6609669667(11) × 107 MHz.

III. NUMERICAL ESTIMATES

(cid:10)

Correlation corrections to hyperﬁne matrix elements in
alkali-metal atoms are large. Thus, for example, a lowest-
order Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculation of the hyperﬁne
constant a3/2 for the 6p3/2 state of Cs (which is propor-
3/2kT (1)k3/2
)
tional to the diagonal matrix element
leads to a result that is a factor of two smaller than
(cid:11)
the experimental value. One expects (and indeed ﬁnds)
corrections of a similar size for the oﬀ-diagonal ma-
1/2kT (1)k3/2
appearing in the numera-
trix element
tor of the expression for the second-order hyperﬁne en-
(cid:11)
(cid:10)
ergy. If we assume that the relative size of the correla-
tion corrections to the two matrix elements mentioned
above are the same, then we can determine the ratio
1/2kT (1)k3/2
by means of a lowest-
order calculation and, using that ratio together with the
(cid:10)
(cid:11)
experimental value of a3/2, obtain an accurate value for
1/2kT (1)k3/2
. That was the strategy used to obtain

order hyperﬁne constants are are compared with experiment.

(The ratio of
matrix elements was determined in the non-relativistic
approximation and did not depend on details of the 6p
wave function. The non-relativistic approximation is not
a serious problem, however, since the ratio obtained us-
ing relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock wave functions diﬀers
from the non-relativistic ratio by less than 5%.)

IV. CORRELATION CORRECTIONS

The estimates made in the previous section de-
pend on the the assumption that correlation corrections
to reduced matrix elements of the hyperﬁne operator
jkT (1)kj′
are independent of the total angular momen-
tum j of the 6pj state. To test that assumption, we car-
(cid:10)
ried out correlated third-order MBPT calculations of the
three 6pj matrix elements.

(cid:11)

In Table I, we give a detailed breakdown of contribu-
tions to the third-order matrix elements. Formulas for
the ﬁrst-, second-, and third-order matrix element are
given in [5]. We use a modiﬁed version of these formulas
in which: (a) the sum of the second-order matrix element
and the third-order contribution to the random-phase ap-
proximation (RPA) is replaced by the exact solution to
the RPA equations, and (b) all one-electron matrix ele-
ments in third-order are replaced by their RPA counter-
parts. These modiﬁcations give dipole transition matrix
elements that are gauge invariant in second- and third-
order [6]. The third-order hyperﬁne constants for the
6p1/2 and 6p3/2 states evaluated in this way are within a
few percent of experiment. Since we use the same method
to evaluate diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements, we
expect the third order oﬀ-diagonal matrix element to be
accurate to a few percent.

Substituting the third-order oﬀ-diagonal matrix ele-
ment given in Table I into Eq. (5), we ﬁnd W (2)
3 = 37.3
Hz and W (2)
4 = 48.3 Hz for the 6p3/2 state. Combin-
ing the second-order corrections with the observed 6p3/2

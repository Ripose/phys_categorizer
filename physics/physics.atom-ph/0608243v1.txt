Abstract
The diﬀerential cross sections for low-energy muonic hydrogen atom scattering from hydrogenic
molecules are directly expressed by the corresponding amplitudes for muonic atom scattering from
hydrogen-isotope nuclei. The energy and angular dependence of these three-body amplitudes is
thus taken naturally into account in scattering from molecules, without involving any pseudopo-
tentials. Eﬀects of the internal motion of nuclei inside the target molecules are included for every
initial rotational-vibrational state. These eﬀects are very signiﬁcant as the considered three-body
amplitudes often vary strongly within the energy interval . 0.1 eV. The diﬀerential cross sections,
calculated using the presented method, have been successfully used for planning and interpret-
ing many experiments in low-energy muon physics. Studies of µ− nuclear capture in pµ and the
measurement of the Lamb shift in pµ atoms created in H2 gaseous targets are recent examples.

INTRODUCTION

A calculation of the diﬀerential cross sections for low-energy scattering of muonic hy-
drogen atoms from hydrogen-isotope (hydrogenic) molecules is the main subject of this
paper. The cross sections are expressed in terms of the corresponding amplitudes for
muonic atom scattering from hydrogen-isotope nuclei. Thus, a dependence of these three-
body scattering amplitudes on the collision energy, scattering angle, and spin is directly
included. For numerical calculations, the three-body amplitudes computed using the adia-
batic method [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], are employed.

Many experiments in low-energy muon physics are performed using molecular hydrogen-
isotope targets (see, e.g., Refs. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]). For planning and interpreting such
experiments, the diﬀerential cross sections for the following processes are often required:

elastic scattering:
isotopic exchange:
and spin-ﬂip:

aµ(F ) + BC

→
aµ + BC

aµ(F ) + AB

→

aµ(F ) + BC,
bµ + AC,
→
aµ(F ′) + AB.

A monic hydrogen-isotope atom in the 1S state is denoted here by aµ or bµ; F and F ′
stand for the initial and ﬁnal total spin of the muonic atom. The molecules BC, AC, and
AB denote the hydrogenic molecules H2, D2, T2, HD, HT, or DT. The processes (1) can
take place with simultaneous rotational and vibrational transitions in a target molecule.
Thus, the name “elastic” assigned here to the scattering (1a) refers solely to the state of the
muonic atom. The cross sections for the processes (1) are henceforth called the “molecular”
cross sections.

For many years, only the cross sections for muonic hydrogen atom scattering from

hydrogen-isotope nuclei (“nuclear” cross sections) were available.

The application of the nuclear cross sections to a description of experiments performed in
molecular targets gives very unsatisfactory results. A characteristic kinetic energy of muonic
atoms in typical gaseous targets is lower than a few eV [16]. Therefore, it is necessary to
take into account eﬀects of molecular binding and electron screening.

Since a muonic hydrogen atom is a small neutral system, the methods developed for
the description of neutron scattering in matter can be adapted, to a certain extent, for the
muonic atom case. Molecular eﬀects in low-energy neutron scattering from nuclei bound
in chemical compounds are estimated using the Fermi pseudopotential [17, 18, 19]. Such
a pseudopotential is proportional to the constant scattering length. The Fermi method was
used for decades for the calculation of low-energy neutron cross sections (see e.g., Ref. [20]
and references therein).
In particular, a quantum-mechanical treatment of slow neutron
scattering from molecular hydrogen and deuterium was presented by Young and Koppel [21].
A method of calculating binding eﬀects in the molecular processes (1), based on the Fermi
approach, was derived in Refs. [22, 23]. In particular, speciﬁc spin-dependent pseudopoten-
tials were introduced for a description of a muonic atom interaction with a single nucleus.
However, this method has a limited applicability since the nuclear processes (2) involve sev-
1 eV) energies, in contrast to low-energy
eral partial scattering waves [5, 8] even at low (

neutron scattering. Moreover, muonic atom scattering often changes strongly (e.g., pµ + p
and tµ + t) with energy in the intervals comparable with the rotational thresholds of hy-
drogenic molecules. A solution to this problem is to base a calculation of the molecular
cross sections on the full nuclear scattering amplitudes, which include all the angular and
energy dependence. The eﬀective radius of interaction between a muonic atom and a nucleus
is much smaller than the internuclear distance in a hydrogen molecule [1]. Therefore, the
amplitude for scattering from two bound nuclei can be well approximated by a sum of the
two corresponding amplitudes for scattering from isolated nuclei. In such an approach, it
is necessary to take into account the internal motion of the nuclei inside a target molecule.
This motion can be neglected for a molecule consisting of heavy nuclei. However, we are
dealing with the lightest molecules and, therefore, the kinetic energy of nuclear motion due
to zero-point vibration is on the order of 0.1 eV.

In Sec. II, the amplitudes for the molecular processes (1) are expressed in terms of the
amplitudes of the three-body reactions (2). The derived formulas depend on the momenta of
internal motion of the nuclei in a target molecule. The diﬀerential cross sections for scattering
from molecules are obtained in Sec. III, using a harmonic model of molecular vibrations.
Also, electron-screening corrections to the cross sections are given in this section. Some
typical examples of the computed diﬀerential cross sections are shown in Sec. IV.

II. AMPLITUDES FOR SCATTERING FROM MOLECULES

Let us consider aµ scattering from a molecule BC consisting of hydrogen-isotope nuclei
b and c and two electrons. First, we assume that the nuclei b and c are diﬀerent from the
nucleus a, so that the scattering is spin-independent [1, 2]. Also, electron screening eﬀects
are neglected in this section. The scattering lengths of the processes aµ + b (c) [5, 8] are
300 aµ (aµ denotes the Bohr radius of the
much smaller than the molecular diameter R0 ≈
aµ atom). The interaction of a muonic hydrogen atom with nucleus b (or c) is important
R0 [1]. Hence, it is assumed that aµ interacts with a single nucleus during
at distances
the collision with the molecule. We also assume that the molecular bond is unperturbed at
the moment of collision. Therefore, aµ collision with b(c) is treated here as if this nucleus
were free, except for its momentum distribution due to the molecular binding [24]. This
means that the amplitude for aµ scattering from a bound nucleus is the same as that for an
identical free nucleus, provided the momentum of the relative motion is not changed.

At large distances between aµ and BC, the initial ψ0 and ﬁnal ψn coordinate wave

functions of the system are as follows:

r) ,
r) ,

ψ0(r, rµ, R) = φi(rµ) Φ0(R) exp(ik0 ·
ψn(r, rµ, R) = φf (rµ) Φn(R) exp(ikn ·
where k0 and kn are the initial and ﬁnal momenta of aµ; Φ0 and Φn are the wave functions
of the initial and ﬁnal rotational-vibrational states of the molecule BC. The corresponding
wave functions of the 1S muonic atom are denoted by φi and φf , where the indices i and f
refer to the processes (2) with the nuclear scattering amplitudes fif [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In Fig. 1,
the relative coordinates used for providing a description of the system are shown. The
vector R connects nucleus b with nucleus c; r denotes the aµ position with respect to the
center of mass (c.m.) of BC; rµ is the aµ internal vector. The vector rb stands for aµ
position relative to nucleus b.

It is convenient to express the amplitude for aµ scattering from BC in terms of the
momenta k0 and kn in the center-of-mass system (c.m.s.) for aµ + BC. On the other hand,
the calculated amplitudes for aµ scattering from nuclei are functions of the initial pb and
ﬁnal p′
b momenta in the c.m.s. of aµ + b. Therefore, further evaluation of the molecular
amplitudes involves the investigation of a transition between the “nuclear” and “molecular”
momenta. First, we assume that both the nuclear and molecular scattering can be described
in the Born approximation. The amplitude for aµ scattering from b bound in BC is thus
given by the following formula (in muonic atomic units e = ~ = µaµ = 1):

energy never vanishes because of the zero-point vibration of the molecule.
In particular,
for the lightest H2 molecule, the second term of Eq. (16) is on the order of 0.01 eV. This
energy is inaccessible, but it aﬀects the molecular scattering amplitude (13). For a ﬁxed ε,
the spectrum of εb is quite wide. Its width is determined by the term √ε εbc which depends
0.3–0.5 eV). Therefore, at a given ε,

the molecular amplitude (13) contains contributions from the nuclear amplitude fif taken
at diﬀerent energies. This eﬀect should be taken into account when fif changes signiﬁcantly
within the spectrum (16) of εb, which often occurs in muonic atom scattering.

In the case of a general spherical potential with a ﬁnite range, it is possible to generalize
the Fermi pseudopotential by the introduction of partial pseudopotentials corresponding
to subsequent scattering waves [25, 26]. However, the calculations of the cross sections
for muonic atom scattering on molecules, presented in this paper, are directly based on
a knowledge of the amplitudes for nuclear scattering. Therefore, a formulation of a gen-
eralized pseudopotential, in this case, is superﬂuous. Let us only note that the correct

The problem of the angular and energy dependence of the nuclear scattering tµ + d in the
tµ+D2 process was alternatively solved in [27] by the introduction of the eﬀective polarization
r−4). However, the magnitude of such a potential for the tµ-d interaction was
potential (
determined separately for every given collision energy. Thus, such an approach is more
complicated than the direct use of the computed nuclear-scattering amplitudes and neglects
a wide distribution of the deuteron kinetic energies in the D2 molecule.

εb spectrum for the ground-state H2 molecule, at several values of ε is presented. At the
lowest energies, the shape of this spectrum is mainly determined by the motion of a bound
proton. The mean value of εb equals 0.036 eV for ε = 0.001 eV. For ε = 0.1 eV, a single broad

B. Spin-dependent scattering

When at least one of the nuclei bound in BC (e.g., the nucleus b) is identical with the
nucleus a, it is necessary to consider spin-dependent reactions (2a) and (2c). Let us introduce
the following notation

J

sµ + sa + sb + sc ,
sµ + sa ,
F + sb ,

≡
F
≡
Sb ≡
J = F + I = Sb + sc = sb + Sc ,

sb + sc ,
F + sc ,

I
≡
Sc ≡

(44)

(45)

(46)

where sµ, sa, sb, and sc, are the spins of the muon and of the nuclei a, b, and c, respectively.
Thus, J is the total spin of aµ + BC system and I is the total nuclear spin of the molecule.
It is assumed that J is conserved in the scattering since the spin-orbit interaction is very
weak. Also, it is assumed that the spin Sb (Sc) is conserved in local collisions of aµ with the
nucleus b (c) bound in BC.

If the isotope c is diﬀerent from a and b, the molecule BC is asymmetric and its parity
is not deﬁnite. Thus, the directions of the nuclear spins sb and sc are independent of each
other, and a unique spin Sb of the subsystem aµ + b is assigned to the initial ξi and ﬁnal ξf
spin states of the system aµ + BC (with ﬁxed values of F and F ′). These states can be
written down as follows:

ξi(Sb, sc; F ) = ξaµ−b(Sb; F ) ξc(sc) ,
ξf (Sb, sc; F ′) = ξaµ−b(Sb; F ′) ξc(sc) ,

where ξaµ−b and ξc are the eigenfunctions of the conserved spins Sb and sc, respectively. In
this case, the total wave functions take the form

ψ0 = φi(rµ) Φ0(R) exp(ik0 ·
ψn = φf (rµ) Φn(R) exp(ikn ·

r) ξi(Sb, sc; F ) ,
r) ξf (Sb, sc; F ′) ,

at large distances r. In order to obtain the correct molecular-scattering amplitudes, sym-
metrization of the functions ψ0, ψn over the two identical particles a and b should be per-
(b)
0n which is expressed by Eq. (36)
formed. As a result, we obtain the molecular amplitude
with f (b)
F F ′ for the process (2a) or (2c).
The calculated amplitudes f Sb
F F ′ are already symmetrized over the identical nuclei [3, 4, 5, 6].
Similarly, the total molecular cross section dσSb
= c is given by Eq. (38)
with f (b)
if = 0 in Eq. (38),

if replaced by the spin-dependent nuclear amplitude f Sb

F F ′. In the case of spin-ﬂip reaction, we substitute f (c)

if replaced by f Sb

0n/dΩ for a = b

F

12

6
because this process is very weak when the isotope b is diﬀerent from a [28]. The cross sec-
tion dσSb
0n/dΩ can be averaged over the projections of spin Sb, which gives the mean cross
section dσ0n/dΩ.

When all the hydrogen isotopes are identical, the molecule BC is symmetric and its initial
and ﬁnal parities PI and P ′
I are deﬁnite. Therefore, the values I and I ′ of the molecular
spin are deﬁnite. The total spin functions of aµ + BC are now eigenstates of J with ﬁxed
values of F and I (or F ′ and I ′). Thus, the total spin state is determined by four quantum
Jz, F , and I. The initial
numbers: the absolute value
and ﬁnal total wave functions of the system with a = b = c are

of the total spin J , its projection

J

ψ0 = φi(rµ) Φ0(R) exp(ik0 ·
ψn = φf (rµ) Φn(R) exp(ikn ·

r) ξi(J ; F, I) ,
r) ξf (J ; F ′, I ′) ,

with the following condition to be satisﬁed

F + I = F′ + I′ = J .

The functions ξi and ξf contain contributions from diﬀerent states of the operator Sb. They
can be expanded as follows:

ξi(J ; F, I) =

Cb(Sb, sc; F, I) ξaµ−b(Sb) ξc(sc) ,

ξf (J ; F ′, I ′) =

C ′
b(Sb, sc; F ′, I ′) ξaµ−b(Sb) ξc(sc) ,

Sb
X

Sb
X

with sc subject to the condition: Sb+sc = J . The factors Cb(Sb, sc; F, I) and C ′
b(Sb, sc; F ′, I ′)
are obtained by the multiple use of the Clebsh-Gordan coeﬃcients. The expansions of the
total spin functions in terms of ξaµ−b(Sb) are necessary since the presented method is based
on knowledge of the three-body scattering amplitudes f Sb
F F ′ evaluated for ﬁxed values of Sb.
After performing a symmetrization of the total potential V (b) + V (c) and of the wave
functions (47) over the three identical nuclei and proceeding as in Sec. II for the spinless
case, one obtains

In the derivation of Eq. (50), it has been assumed that the three nuclei are never close

As a result, the molecular amplitude (50) is expressed in terms of the three-body ampli-
tudes f Sb

C. Electron screening corrections to molecular cross sections

The diﬀerential molecular cross sections derived in the previous section include only the
muonic-atom interaction with nuclei. It is necessary, however, to include electron screening
eﬀects in aµ scattering from molecules. At ε . 1 eV, the relative velocity of aµ and BC
is smaller by several orders of magnitude than the muon velocity in aµ and is also smaller
than the electron velocity in the molecule. Therefore, it is possible to introduce an eﬀec-
tive electron-screening potential, which is obtained by averaging the Coulomb interaction
between aµ and the electrons over the muon and the electron coordinates. The range of
a dominant fraction of the aµ-b potential is smaller than about 20 aµ [1]. On the other
hand, the aµ interaction with the electrons is important at distances on the order of the
207 aµ of the electronic hydrogen atom. Thus, aµ collision with an ordinary
Bohr radius ae ≈
molecule can be described as scattering on the two potentials with very diﬀerent ranges.

The eﬀective screening potential Vel for aµ scattering from hydrogenic molecules has the

following form [22, 29]:

taking part in direct collision. Therefore, aµ scattering from electrons cannot cause these
reactions.The ﬁrst non-vanishing screening corrections to the spin-ﬂip or isotopic-exchange
cross sections appear only in the distorted wave Born approximation.

A further evaluation of the screening corrections to the scattering amplitudes should
be performed numerically. With regard to the elastic processes, these corrections are very
el
0n for pµ+H2 elastic scattering
signiﬁcant. For example, at ε
0, the screening amplitude
is comparable to the corresponding pµ + p scattering amplitude. In this limit, the relative
screening corrections to the spin-ﬂip or isotopic-exchange amplitudes are on the order of 10%.
At ε & 1 eV, screening eﬀects practically vanish for all processes.

IV. EXAMPLES OF MOLECULAR CROSS SECTIONS

In this section some typical examples of the molecular cross sections are shown. The
nuclear scattering amplitudes given in Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are used as the input for
computation of the molecular diﬀerential cross sections. These amplitudes are ﬁrst averaged
over the internal motion of nuclei inside the target molecules, according to Eq. (29).

is smeared out after the averaging over proton motion in H2. Although the vibrational
quantum for T2 is smaller than that for H2, smoothing of the amplitude for tµ + t elastic
scattering is also important, owing to strong changes of its value within the energy interval
of 0.1 eV. This is particularly visible in the cusp region and at ε
0. This smearing strongly
aﬀects the molecular cross sections, which are expressed by the squared amplitudes. The
elastic cross sections for dµ + d scattering are quite ﬂat at the lowest energies [3, 5, 6]. As
a result, diﬀerences between the amplitudes f S
if are much smaller than in the protium
or tritium case. The role of smearing eﬀects were investigated during ﬁnal a analysis of the
PSI diﬀusion data [16]. A spectacular improvement of the ﬁts to the data, especially for pµ
diﬀusion in H2, was achieved when the averaged nuclear amplitudes f S
if were used for the
calculations of the molecular cross sections. This mainly concerns the elastic cross sections,
as smoothing eﬀects are generally much smaller in the case of spin-ﬂip or isotopic-exchange
amplitudes, which weakly depend on the energy below 1 eV [3, 4, 5, 7, 8].

Electron-screening and molecular-binding eﬀects are clearly seen in the molecular diﬀer-
ential cross sections. The range of the screening potential (54) is on the order of ae, so
that the condition k0ae ∼
0.001 eV. Many partial waves begin
to contribute signiﬁcantly to the screening amplitude (56) above 0.001 eV. As a result, the
molecular cross sections are anisotropic even at very low energies. Moreover, scattering
from a molecule is connected with diﬀerent rotational transitions, which additionally leads
to a complicated angular distribution of the scattered atoms. This is in contrast to aµ scat-
tering from a bare hydrogen nucleus, where few partial waves contribute signiﬁcantly to the
nuclear cross sections below 100 eV. In all of the three-body cases, the s-wave cross section
describes scattering below 0.1–1 eV well, which is therefore isotropic in the nuclear c.m.s..
The cross section dσ0n/dΩ for pµ scattering from a ground-state H2 molecule is presented
in Fig. 7, for ε = 0.25 eV and ε = 0.5 eV. Scattering at the angles ϑ . 30◦ is dominated by
pµ scattering from the electron cloud. The peaks at greater angles are due to the rotational
K ′ = 4. The angular positions of the scattering
transitions K = 0
peaks change with the variation of pµ energy.

sake of comparison with this molecular target. Only the s wave contributes to the pµ + p
cross section in the considered energy interval. However, the scattering is not isotropic in
the molecular c.m.s.. A cusp is apparent at the energy of the spin-ﬂip threshold. The
surface in Fig. 9 describes the corresponding cross section dσ0n/dΩ (cut above a value of
10−20 cm2/sr) for the ground-state H2 molecule. The electron-screening contribution
3.5
to the diﬀerential cross section is clearly seen at all angles for ε . 0.05 eV and only as
a forward peak at higher energies. The lowest rotational transitions can be distinguished
in this plot. Also a smearing of the molecular cross section due to the proton internal
motion in H2 is visible, especially in the spin-ﬂip threshold region. The sections of the
surfaces shown in Figs. 8 and 9 with the plane ε = 1 eV are already quite similar, apart
from the forward scattering. Thus, the molecular scattering at larger energies and angles,
which contains contributions from many rotational-vibrational transitions, approaches the
“doubled” nuclear scattering.
For a better comparison, the angular dependence of the
doubled nuclear and the molecular cross sections are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, at a ﬁxed

ε = 1 eV, these cross sections are already quite similar at larger angles ϑ & 20◦. One sees
that there are only small rotational oscillations of the molecular curve around the doubled
nuclear curve.

The diﬀerential cross sections for the downwards spin-ﬂip reaction in pµ(F = 1) scattering
from a proton and from a H2 molecule are shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Electron-screening
and molecular-binding eﬀects in the spin-ﬂip reactions are not so important as in the case of
spin-conserving scattering (cf. Figs. 9 and 13), owing to higher momentum transfers. Larger
diﬀerences between the nuclear and the molecular spin-ﬂip cross sections appear mainly at
small collision energies and small angles.

Simulations of experiments performed in gaseous hydrogenic targets require knowledge of
the diﬀerential cross sections for the molecular processes (1). These molecular cross sections
have been computed and stored as computer ﬁles. They have been applied for planning and
interpreting many experiments in H-D gaseous targets. For example, optimal conditions for

studies of µ− nuclear capture in pµ [11, 12] and for the measurement of the Lamb shift in pµ
atoms [13, 14, 15] created in H2 targets have been determined using the calculated molecular
cross sections. These experiments are now underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute.

V. CONCLUSIONS

A method of calculating the diﬀerential cross sections for low-energy muonic atom scat-
tering from hydrogenic molecules has been developed. This method directly uses the cor-
responding amplitudes for muonic atom scattering from hydrogen-isotope nuclei, calculated
within the framework of the adiabatic method for the three-body problem with the Coulomb
interaction. Thus, the presented method naturally includes the angular and energy depen-
dence of the three-body amplitudes in the scattering from hydrogenic molecules. Since, in
many cases, the considered three-body scattering amplitudes depend strongly on the colli-
sion energy within the interval . 0.1-eV, a broad distribution of the nucleus kinetic energy in

a hydrogenic molecule is taken into account. The molecular vibrations are described in the
harmonic approximation. Therefore, the evaluated cross sections are valid below a few eV.
For a ﬁxed energy ε of a muonic atom collision with a hydrogenic molecule, the calcu-
lated collision energy εb in the system consisting of the atom and a single hydrogen-isotope
nucleus has a wide spectrum. At ε
0, this spectrum reveals a shape of the kinetic energy
distribution of the nucleus in a given rotational-vibrational state of the molecule. This eﬀect
is very signiﬁcant, even for the molecular ground state, as the energy of zero-point vibration
in hydrogenic molecules is quite large. The width of the εb spectrum for the lightest H2
molecule is on the order of 0.1 eV. At higher ε, this width is even larger. As a result, the
three-body amplitudes are strongly smoothed when calculating the molecular cross sections.
This eﬀect and the energy and angular dependence of the three-body amplitudes are included
in the calculated set of the diﬀerential cross sections for low-energy scattering of 1S muonic
hydrogen atoms from hydrogenic molecules. These are the only to date theoretical cross
sections which give good agreement with many experiments involving pµ and dµ scattering
in gaseous H-D targets. The presented method can also be applied for scattering of other
ground-state exotic atoms or neutrons from hydrogenic targets.

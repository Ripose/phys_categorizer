We use Bloch oscillations in a horizontal moving standing wave to transfer a large number of
photon recoils to atoms with a high eﬃciency (99.5% per cycle). By measuring the photon recoil of
87Rb, using velocity selective Raman transitions to select a subrecoil velocity class and to measure
the ﬁnal accelerated velocity class, we have determined h/mRb with a relative precision of 0.4
ppm. To exploit the high momentum transfer eﬃciency of our method, we are developing a vertical
−8 and hence the ﬁne
standing wave set-up. This will allow us to measure h/mRb better than 10
structure constant α with an uncertainty close to the most accurate value coming from the (g − 2)
determination.

In the past 20 years, atom manipulation using laser
light has led to the emergence of many powerful tech-
niques [1]. In particular, it is now possible to observe and
measure elementary processes between light and atoms,
such as a coherent momentum transfer (absorption and
emission of a single photon). Furthermore, by increas-
ing the interrogation time, laser cooling leads to an im-
provement of more than two orders of magnitude in both
stability and accuracy in many ﬁelds of high precision
measurements [2, 3]. These advances allow us to mea-
sure precisely the recoil velocity vr of the atom absorb-
ing or emitting a photon ( vr = ~k/m, where k is the
wave vector of the photon absorbed by the atom of mass
m). Such a measurement yields a determination of h/m
which can be used to infer a value for the ﬁne structure
constant α via [4]:

M and m are respectively, the mass of test particle in
atomic and SI Units. In this expression several terms are
known with a very small uncertainty: 8 × 10−12 for the
Rydberg constant R∞ [5, 6] and 7×10−10 for the electron
mass Me [7, 8]. A recent measurement using Penning
trap single ion spectrometry allows a determination of
MRb with an uncertainty less than 2 × 10−10 [9].
In
short, the determination of α using this formula is now
limited by the uncertainty in the ratio h/m [4].

The ﬁne structure constant can be deduced from ex-
periments related to diﬀerent branches of physics (QED,
Solid state physics,...) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Many of
these measurements lead to determinations of α with a
relative uncertainty on the order of 10−8 but their total
dispersion exceeds 10−7(CODATA 98, [16]). In order to
test the validity of these diﬀerent measurements, a new
accurate determination of α is highly desirable.

The recoil of an atom when it absorbs a photon was
ﬁrst observed in the recoil-induced spectral doubling of

the CH4 saturated absorption peaks [17]. Since then, al-
most all recent measurements of the recoil velocity have
been based on atomic interferometry [18] using stimu-
lated Raman transitions between two hyperﬁne ground
state levels [19, 20]. The precision of these experiments
is increased by giving additional photon recoils to the dif-
ferent interferometer paths. In this process, the eﬃciency
of the recoil transfer is a crucial parameter. Recently,
S. Chu group at Stanford, using a coherent adiabatic
transfer technique and high intensity Raman transitions
pulses, has achieved an eﬃciency of 94%, allowing a total
momentum transfer of 120 recoils, and hence an absolute
accuracy of 7.4 parts per billion in α [20]. D. Pritchard
and colleagues have developed another tool for a determi-
nation of h/mN a, using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a
bright subrecoil atom source in the ”contrast interferom-
etry” technique [21]. This experiment seems, presently,
to be limited by the low momentum transfers.

In this paper, we investigate the phenomena of Bloch
oscillations of atoms driven by a constant inertial force in
a periodic optical potential [23]. This method is based on
stimulated Raman transitions, induced by counterprop-
agating laser beams, involving only one hyperﬁne level
in order to modify the atomic momentum, thus leaving
the internal state unchanged. The atoms are coherently
accelerated using a frequency-chirped standing wave. In
order to compensate the Doppler eﬀect, the frequency
diﬀerence between the two beams is increased linearly.
Consequently, the atoms are resonant with the beams
periodically. This leads to a succession of rapid adia-
batic passages between momentum states diﬀering by 2~k
(2vr in terms of velocity). As explained above, the ﬁnal
accuracy is determined by the number of additional re-
coils, which strongly depends on the eﬃciency population
transfer between momentum states. In our experiment,
we achieve an eﬃciency of 99.5% per Bloch oscillation;
which may provide a great opportunity for high precision

measurement of the recoil shift.

The details of the experiment have been described pre-
viously [24]. The set-up for the laser cooling uses a
magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a Rubidium vapor cell.
After a few seconds, the MOT is loaded and then the
magnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ, leaving the atoms to equi-
librate in an optical molasses, at a temperature of about
3 µK. The sequence then involves three steps (see Fig.1):
ﬁrst we select a narrow subrecoil velocity class with a
well deﬁned mean initial velocity using a Raman velocity-
selective π-pulse [25]. Next we transfer 2N photon recoils
by a coherent acceleration of atoms (Bloch oscillations).
Finally, we measure the ﬁnal velocity class, using another
Raman velocity-selective π-pulse.

For the initial selection and the ﬁnal measurement, the
two Raman beams are generated by two Master Oscilla-
tory Power Ampliﬁers (MOPAs) injected by two grating-
stabilized extended-cavity laser diodes (ECLs). One of
the two diodes is frequency stabilized on a highly sta-
ble Zerodur Fabry-Perot Cavity (ZFPC). This cavity was
calibrated using diﬀerent optical references, allowing a
determination of the laser frequency with an accuracy
better than 10 MHz (3 × 10−8). A heterodyne signal and
a frequency chain around the Rubidium hyperﬁne split-

2

ting (6.8 GHz) are used to phase lock the second ECL to
the ﬁrst one. All auxiliary sources in the frequency chain
are referenced to the same stable 10 MHz quartz oscil-
lator. To reduce spontaneous emission and light shift,
the ECLs are detuned by about 340 GHz from the D2
line. The MOPA beams are sent through two 80 MHz
acousto-optic modulators for timing and intensity con-
trol. Their radio frequencies are also referenced to the
10 MHz quartz oscillator. The two beams are coupled in
an optical ﬁber, they have linear orthogonal polarizations
and their intensities are actively stabilized.

In order to perform the selection phase, we use a
square Raman pulse with a frequency initially ﬁxed at
δselect. For a detuning of 340 GHz and an intensity
of 120 mW/cm2, the π condition is achieved using a
T = 1.7 ms pulse. Such a pulse transfers atoms from state
52S1/2, |F = 2, mF = 0i to 52S1/2, |F = 1, mF = 0i, with
a velocity dispersion of about vr/30 centered around
(λδselect/2) − vr where λ is the laser wavelength. In this
horizontal geometry, the width of the transferred veloc-
ity class, which is proportional to 1/T , is only limited
by the fall of the atoms through the lasers beams. The
value of T represents a good compromise between resolu-
tion (the width of the selected velocity distribution) and
the signal-to-noise ratio (proportional to the number of
selected atoms).

After the Raman selection process, a beam resonant
with 52S1/2, F = 2 to 52P3/2, F = 3 cycling transition
pushes away atoms remaining in state F = 2. The se-
lected atoms are then exposed to two counterpropagat-
ing beams generated by a Ti-Sapphire laser whose fre-
quency is also stabilized to the ZFPC. This laser beam
is split in two, each beam passing through an acousto-
optic modulator to control its frequency. In order to per-
form a coherent acceleration, we vary the frequency dif-
ference between the two Bloch beams linearly with time:
∆ν(t) = 2at/λ where a is the eﬀective acceleration. The
two beams are superimposed onto the horizontal optical
axis of the selection Raman beams using the same optical
ﬁbers. The two Bloch beams have the same linear polar-
ization, equal intensity (160 mW for each beam) and are
red detuned by 100 GHz from the 52S1/2 to 52P3/2 res-
onance line. The duration of the acceleration process is
typically 4.4 ms. The optical potential is adiabatically
turned on in about 300 µs.

In the case where the constant inertial force seen by the
atoms is weak enough, all the selected atoms are accel-
erated. In a Bloch oscillation scheme, this is equivalent
to avoiding interband transitions. This condition may be
expressed in the weak binding limit [26] by:

π

d∆ν(t)
dt

<<

U0
2~ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(2)

where U0 is the depth of the potential induced by the
light shift due to the standing wave. In this limit, the

interband transition rate per Bloch period is given by
a Landau-Zener formula R = e(−ac/a) where ac is the
critical acceleration, proportional to (U0/Er)2 (Er is the
recoil energy) [23]. In our experiment U0 is about 11 Er
and atoms acceleration is 133 ms−2 leading to a theoret-
ical eﬃciency of 99.9% per oscillation.

After the acceleration process we perform the ﬁnal ve-
locity measurement using another Raman π-pulse, whose
frequency is δmeasure. Population transfer from the hyper-
ﬁne state F=1 to the hyperﬁne state F=2 due to the sec-
ond Raman pulse is maximal when 2π(δselect−δmeasure) =
2N × (k1 − k2) · kBloch~/mRb, where k1, k2 and kBloch
are respectively the wave vectors of the Raman and Bloch
beams. The populations (F = 1 and F = 2) are mea-
sured separately by using the one-dimensional time of
ﬂight technique developed for atomic clocks and depicted
in [27]. The detection zone is 15 cm below the center of
the trap (Figure 2). To avoid the horizontal motion of
the atoms, and in order for the atoms to reach the detec-
tion zone, a symmetric acceleration-deceleration scheme
is used : instead of selecting atoms at rest, we ﬁrst accel-
erate them to 2N vr, using N Bloch oscillations, then we
make the three steps sequence: selection, coherent decel-
eration (N Bloch oscillations) and measurement, accord-
ing to Fig. 1.

Fig. 2b shows a typical time of ﬂight signal for F = 2
(left peak) and F = 1 (right peak) when the second Ra-
man frequency is centered at the top of the ﬁnal veloc-
ity distribution. In this ﬁgure, we present the signal for
N = 0 and for N = 40 Bloch oscillations. Comparing the
number of atoms between the two situations, we demon-
strate that the losses during the Bloch acceleration for
N = 40 are less than 20%, corresponding to a transfer
eﬃciency of about 99.5% per oscillation. These losses are
not due to the spontaneous emission, which is evaluated
to 0.1% per oscillation, but probably to the residual hori-
zontal displacement of the atoms (about 5 mm) after the
acceleration-deceleration process.

To reduce systematic errors, we perform an alternate
and symmetric recoil transfer in both horizontal opposite
directions. We determine the recoil frequency by a diﬀer-
ential measurement of the center of the two ﬁnal velocity
distributions. Fig.3 shows a typical scan of ﬁnal velocity
distribution for N = 50 Bloch oscillations for both di-
rections. Each of the 400 data points corresponds to a
single cycle (cooling, selection, acceleration of 2N vr, and
measure). From a data analysis of 200 points (10 min-
utes) we can split the ﬁnal velocity distribution with an
uncertainty of vr/5000. Hence, the relative uncertainty
of the measurement of vr is 1.5 × 10−6.

Fig. 4 shows, chronologically, 43 determinations of
h/mRb using such measurements, compared to the ex-
pected value of h/mRb, using the CODATA 98 value of
α. The mean value lies 6.1 × 10−7 above the expected
value with a relative uncertainty of 4.2 × 10−7. We have
estimated errors form wave front curvature (1.3 ppb), dif-

ferential light shift (80 ppb), Zeeman eﬀect (57 ppb) and
laser frequencies (52 ppb). They are an order of magni-
tude lower compared to this disagreement. We believe
that this disagreement and the dispersion of the results
(χ2 = 99 for 43 measurements) can be explained by the
systematic variations of the initial velocity distribution
of the cold cloud and the phase ﬂuctuation of the Raman
beams. These eﬀects have not yet been quantiﬁed.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that coherent ac-
celeration using Bloch oscillations is a powerful method
to transfer a large number of additional photon recoils to
atoms. In the horizontal scheme, the number of momen-
tum recoil transfers is limited by the fall of atoms. In
order to take advantage of the high transfer eﬃciency of
the Bloch oscillation technique, we plan to build a set-up
with vertical Bloch and Raman beams. In this case, the
number of additional recoils will be limited by the trans-
verse motion, and we can increase the π-pulse duration in
order to select a narrower velocity class. Moreover, due
to the gravitational acceleration g, the vertical motion
is more complicated and this geometry provides scope
for two diﬀerent experiments: either the atoms are ac-
celerated by a moving standing wave as in the horizontal

this case, the atoms oscillate around the same position
at the frequency mg/2~k [24]. Furthermore, there is no
signiﬁcant displacement of the atom between the velocity
selection and measurement, and thus, several systematic
eﬀects are reduced. On the other hand, a precise deter-
mination of the local gravity ﬁeld is required to exploit
this technique to the full. Finally we expect to increase
the number of transferred recoils up to N = 500, to ob-

tain a determination of vr with an uncertainty better
than 10−8, leading to a determination of α with an un-
certainty of about 5 ppb, close to the more accurate value
deduced from (g − 2) [11, 12, 16]

Abstract

Scattering of positronium (Ps) by sodium and potassium atoms has

been investigated employing a three-Ps-state coupled-channel model with

Ps(1s,2s,2p) states using a time-reversal-symmetric regularized electron-

exchange model potential ﬁtted to reproduce accurate theoretical results for

PsNa and PsK binding energies. We ﬁnd a narrow S-wave singlet resonance

at 4.58 eV of width 0.002 eV in the Ps-Na system and at 4.77 eV of width

0.003 eV in the Ps-K system. Singlet P-wave resonances in both systems are

found at 5.07 eV of width 0.3 eV. Singlet D-wave structures are found at 5.3

eV in both systems. We also report results for elastic and Ps-excitation cross

sections for Ps scattering by Na and K.

Recent successful high precision measurements of positronium (Ps) scattering by H2, N2,

He, Ne, Ar, C4H10, and C5H12 [1,2] have enhanced theoretical activities [3–6] in this subject.

We suggested [7] a regularized, symmetric, nonlocal electron-exchange model potential and

used it in the successful study of Ps scattering by H [8], He [7,9–11], Ne [11], Ar [11], H2

[12] and Li [13]. Our results were in agreement with experimental total cross sections [1,2],

specially at low energies for He, Ne, Ar and H2. Moreover, these studies yielded correct

results for resonance and binding energies for the S wave electronic singlet state of Ps-H

[4,8] and Ps-Li [13] systems in addition to experimental pick-oﬀ quenching rate in Ps-He

[10] scattering.

systems.

In the present work we use the above exchange potential to study Ps-Na and Ps-K

scattering using the three-Ps-state coupled channel method. We ﬁnd resonances in the

singlet channel at low energies in S, P and D waves of both systems near the Ps(2) excitation

threshold. We also report angle-integrated elastic and Ps-excitation cross sections for both

The appearance of resonances in electron-atom [14] and positron-atom [15] scattering,

and in other atomic processes in general, is of great interest. Several resonances in the

electron-hydrogen system have been found in the close-coupling calculation and later recon-

ﬁrmed in the variational calculation [16]. Resonances have also been found in the close-

coupling calculation of electron scattering by Li, Na and K [17]. These resonances provide

the necessary testing ground for a theoretical formulation, which can eventually be detected

experimentally. Detailed dynamical description of the important degrees of freedom in a

theoretical formulation is necessary for the appearance of these resonances. The ability of

the present exchange potential to reproduce the resonances in diverse Ps-atom systems [8,13]

assures its realistic nature.

The theory for the coupled-channel study of Ps scattering with the regularized model

potential has already appeared in the literature [7,8,11] and we quote the relevant working

equations here. For target-elastic scattering we solve the following Lippmann-Schwinger

denote the appropriate momentum states of Ps; kν′′ is the on-shell relative momentum of Ps
in the channel ν′′. We use atomic unit (a.u.) where ¯h = m = 1 with m is the electron mass.

To avoid complication of calculating exchange potential with a many-electron wave func-

tion, we consider a frozen-core one-electron approximation for the targets Na and K. Such

wave functions have been successfully used for scattering of alkali metal atoms in other

contexts and also for positronium scattering by Li [5]. The Na(3s) and K(4s) frozen-core

hydrogen-atom-like wave functions are taken as

model-exchange amplitude (5) reduces to [19] the Born-Oppenheimer exchange amplitude

[20]. This exchange potential for Ps scattering is considered [7] to be a generalization of the

Ochkur-Rudge exchange potential for electron scattering [21].

After a partial-wave projection, the system of coupled equations (1) is solved by the

method of matrix inversion. Forty Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used in the dis-

cretization of each momentum-space integral. The calculation is performed with the exact

Ps wave functions and frozen-core orbitals (2) and (3) for Na and K ground state. We

consider Ps-Na and Ps-K scattering using the three-Ps-state model that includes the fol-

lowing states: Ps(1s)Na(3s), Ps(2s)Na(3s), Ps(2p)Na(3s), and Ps(1s)K(4s), Ps(2s)K(4s),

Ps(2p)K(4s), for Na and K, respectively. The parameter C of the potential given by (5)

and (6) was adjusted to ﬁt the accurate theoretical results [22] for PsNa and PsK binding

energies which are 0.005892 a.u. and 0.003275 a.u., respectively. We ﬁnd that C = 0.785

ﬁts both binding energies well in the three-Ps-state model and this value of C is used in all

calculations reported here. The proper strength of the model potential is obtained by ﬁtting

the binding energies of the Ps-Na and Ps-K systems, and it is expected that this choice of

C would lead to a good overall description of scattering in these systems. We recall that

this value of C also reproduced the accurate variational result of PsH resonance energy in a

recent ﬁve-state model for Ps-H scattering [8]. A similar variation of the parameter C from

unity also led to a good overall description of the total scattering cross section in agreement

with experiment [2] in the Ps-He system in the energy range 0 eV to 70 eV [9].

The Ps-Na and Ps-K systems have an eﬀective attractive interaction in the electronic

singlet channel as in Ps-H [8] and Ps-Li [13] systems. The targets of these systems have

one active electron outside a closed shell. In the present three-Ps-state calculation we ﬁnd

resonances in the singlet channel in both systems. No resonances appear in the triplet

channel possibly because of a predominantly repulsive interaction in this channel. For the

resonances to appear, the inclusion of the excited states of Ps is fundamental in a coupled-

channel calculation. The static-exchange model with both the target and Ps in the ground

state does not lead to these resonances. A detailed study of these resonances in coupled-

channel study of Ps-H [4,8] and Ps-Li [13] systems in the singlet channel has appeared in

the literature.

Here to study the resonances, ﬁrst we calculate the S-, P- and D-wave elastic phase

shifts and cross sections in the singlet channel of the Ps-Na and Ps-K systems using the

3-Ps-state model. In ﬁgure 1 we show the low-energy singlet S-wave cross sections. The

singlet S-wave phase shifts near the resonance energies are shown in the oﬀ-set of ﬁgure 1.

The Ps-Na system has a resonance at 4.58 eV of width 0.002 eV. The resonance in the Ps-K

4

system appears at 4.77 eV and has a width 0.003 eV. The phase shift curves clearly show

the resonances where the phase shifts jump by π.

In ﬁgure 2 we show the singlet P-wave Ps-Na and Ps-K elastic phase shifts; the cor-

responding singlet P-wave cross sections are shown in the oﬀ-set. Both systems possess

resonances at 5.07 eV of width of 0.3 eV. The cross sections clearly exhibit these resonances.

In ﬁgure 3 we plot the D-wave singlet elastic cross sections for Ps-Na and Ps-K systems at

low energies. There is a structure in both systems at 5.3 eV which is more diﬀuse than in S

and P waves.

Next we calculate the diﬀerent partial cross sections of Ps-Na and Ps-K scattering. The

convergence of the cross sections with respect to partial waves is slower in this case than in

the case of Ps-H scattering. At a incident Ps energy of 50 eV, 40 partial waves were used to

achieve convergence of the partial-wave scheme. In ﬁgures 4 and 5 we plot diﬀerent angle-

integrated partial cross sections of Ps-Na and Ps-K scattering, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we

plot the elastic, Ps(2s) and Ps(2p) excitation cross sections using the three-Ps-state model.

For comparison we also plot the elastic cross section obtained with the static-exchange

model. The elastic cross section is large at low energies in both systems. The eﬀect of the

inclusion of highly polarizable Ps(2) states in the coupling scheme could be considerable,

specially at low energies. The local minima in the three-Ps-state elastic cross section for

both systems at about 4

5 eV are manifestations of the P- and D-wave resonances in this

energy region. Similar minima found in electron scattering by alkali-metal atoms are also

∼

consequences of resonances [17].

To summarize, we have performed a three-Ps-state coupled-channel calculation of Ps-Na

and Ps-K scattering at low energies using a regularized symmetric nonlocal electron-exchange

model potential [7] successfully used [7–13] previously in diﬀerent Ps scattering problems.

The only parameter of the model potential was adjusted to ﬁt accurate theoretical result for

PsNa and PsK binding [22]. We present the results of angle-integrated partial cross sections

at diﬀerent Ps energies. We ﬁnd resonances in S, P and D waves near the Ps(2) excitation

threshold.

In this study we have used a three-Ps-state model. Similar resonances have

been observed in the coupled-channel study of electron-H [16], electron-Na, electron-K [17],

positron-hydrogen [15], Ps-H [4,8] and Ps-Li [13] systems. In most cases, a more complete

calculation and (in some cases) experiments have reconﬁrmed these resonances. Hence we

do not believe that the appearance of resonances in the present three-state calculation to be

so peculiar as to have no general validity. On the contrary, in view of the correlation found

between resonance and binding energies in the singlet Ps-H system [8], it is expected that

the reproduction of correct binding energies of the Ps-Na and Ps-K systems in the present

5

model should lead to correct resonance energies in these systems. However, the resonance

energies might change slightly after a more complete calculation (with accurate many-body

wave functions of the target and including the excited states of the target) and it would be

intersting to study the present resonances using more complete theoretical models in the

future in addition to compare the present results with future experiments.

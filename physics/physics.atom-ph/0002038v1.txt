We analyze strong ﬁeld atomic dynamics semiclassically, based on a full time-dependent description
with the Hermann-Kluk propagator. From the properties of the exact classical trajectories, in
particular the accumulation of action in time, the prominent features of above threshold ionization
(ATI) and higher harmonic generation (HHG) are proven to be interference phenomena. They are
reproduced quantitatively in the semiclassical approximation. Moreover, the behavior of the action
of the classical trajectories supports the so called strong ﬁeld approximation which has been devised
and postulated for strong ﬁeld dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the last two decades multiphoton processes have
been studied intensively, experimentally as well as the-
oretically. The inherent time-dependent nature of an
atomic or molecular excitation process induced by a short
laser pulse renders a theoretical description problem-
atic in two respects. Firstly, a full quantum calculation
in three dimensions requires a large computational ef-
fort. For this reason, quantum calculations have been
restricted to one active electron in most cases [1,2]. Sec-
ondly, an intuitive understanding for an explicitly time
dependent process seems to be notoriously diﬃcult, ex-
empliﬁed by pertinent discussions about stabilization in
intense laser ﬁelds [3–5]. Many studies have been car-
ried out to gain an intuitive understanding of the two
most prominent strong ﬁeld phenomena, namely High
Harmonic Generation (HHG) and Above Threshold Ion-
ization (ATI). In the well established early analytical for-
mulation by Keldysh, Faisal and Reiss the atomic poten-
tial is treated as a perturbation for the motion of the
electron in a strong laser ﬁeld [6].

This picture is still used in more recent models, where
the classical dynamics of the electron in the laser ﬁeld is
explicitly considered, e.g. in Corkum’s rescattering model
which can explain the cutoﬀ observed in HHG for linearly
polarized laser light in one spatial dimension [7]. The
corresponding Hamiltonian reads [8]

H = H0 + E0f (t) x sin(ω0t + δ) ,

(1)

where H0 = 1
2 p2 + V (x) is the atomic Hamiltonian, f (t)
is the time-proﬁle of the laser pulse with maximum am-
plitude E0, and ω0 is the laser frequency. The interaction
of the electron with the atom is speciﬁed by the potential
V .

Lewenstein et al. extended Corkum’s rescattering idea
to a quasiclassical model which contains one (relevant)

1

bound state not inﬂuenced by the laser ﬁeld on the one
hand side and electrons which only feel the laser ﬁeld on
the other side [9]. This simple model explains qualita-
tively the features of HHG well. The same is also true
for an alternative model, where the electron is bound
by a zero-range potential [10] However, the basic ques-
tion if and to which extent these multiphoton processes
can be understood semiclassically, i.e., by interference of
classical trajectories alone, remains unanswered. It is as-
tonishing that no direct semiclassical investigation of the
Hamiltonian Eq. (1) has been performed while a number
of classical as well as quantum calculations for Eq. (1)
have been published. However, only recently, a semiclas-
sical propagation method has been formulated which can
be implemented with reasonable numerical eﬀort. This is
very important for the seemingly simple Hamiltonian Eq.
(1) whose classical dynamics is mixed and in some phase
space regions highly chaotic which requires eﬃcient com-
putation to achieve convergence. Equipped with these
semiclassical tools we have studied multiphoton phenom-
ena semiclassically in the frame work of Eq. (1). In com-
parison to the exact quantum solution we will work out
those features of the intense ﬁeld dynamics that can be
understood in terms of interference of classical trajecto-
ries.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In section II we
provide the tools for the calculation of a semiclassical,
time-dependent wavefunction. In section III we discuss
Above-Threshold-Ionization (ATI) and work out the clas-
sical quantities which structure semiclassically the rele-
vant observables. In section IV we use this knowledge for
the description of Higher-Harmonic-Generation (HHG).
Section V concludes the paper with a comparison of HHG
and ATI from a semiclassical perspective and a short
summary.

II. CALCULATION OF THE SEMICLASSICAL

WAVE FUNCTION

can be calculated analytically and Eq. (2) reads together
with Eq. (3)

A (multi-dimensional) wave function Ψβ(x, t) can be

expressed as

Ψ(x, t) = Z t

0

dx′ K(x, x′, t) Ψ(x′) .

(2)

Here, Ψ(x′) is the initial wave function at t = 0 and
K(x, x′, t) denotes the propagator. We will not use the
well-known semiclassical Van Vleck-Gutzwiller (VVG)
propagator which is inconvenient for several reasons.
Firstly, one has to deal with caustics, i.e. singularities
of the propagator, and secondly, it is originally formu-
lated as a boundary value problem. For numerical ap-
plications much better suited (and for analytical consid-
erations not worse) is the so called Herman-Kluk (HK)
propagator which is a uniformized propagator in initial
value representation [11,12], formulated in phase space,

K HK(x, x′, t) =

Each phase space point (q, p) in the integrand of Eq.
(3) is the starting point of a classical trajectory with
action Sqp(t). The terms Xy in the weight factor Cqp(t)
are the four elements of the monodromy matrix, Xy =
∂xt/∂y. The square root in Eq. (5) has to be calculated
in such a manner that Cqp(t) is a continuous function of
t. The integrand in Eq. (3) is – depending on the system
– highly oscillatory. Although we restrict ourselves to one
spatial dimension (see Eq. (1)) the number of trajectories
necessary for numerical convergence can reach 107. We
note in passing that an integration by stationary phase
approximation over momentum and coordinate variables
reduces the HK-propagator to the VVG-propagator [13].
In all calculations presented here we have used a Gaus-

sian wave packet as initial wave function,

Ψβ(x′) = (cid:18) β

taken γ = β.

For comparison with our semiclassical calculations we
determined the quantum mechanical wave function using
standard Fast Fourier Transform split operator methods
[14].

III. ABOVE THRESHOLD IONIZATION

We start from Eq. (1) with δ = 0 and use a rectangular
pulse shape f (t) which lasts for 4.25 optical cycles. This
setting is very similar to the one used in [15].

The energy spectrum of the electrons can be expressed
by the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function
after the pulse, i.e. for times t > tf ,

is calculated by propagating Ψf for some time with the
atomic Hamiltonian H0 only after the laser has been
switched oﬀ.

A. Quantum mechanical and semiclassical spectra

for ATI

We will present results for two types of potentials to
elucidate the dependence of the semiclassical approxima-
tion on the form of the potential.

1. Softcore potential

First we apply the widely used softcore potential

[15,16]

V (x) = −

1

√x2 + a

(11)

with a = 1 and with an ionization potential Ip = 0.670
a.u.. We have checked that the correlation function
diﬀers little if calculated with the exact ground state
or with the ground state wave function approximated

by the Gaussian of Eq. (6) where β = 0.431 a.u. and
qβ = 0. However, the semiclassical calculation is consid-
erably simpliﬁed with a Gaussian as initial state as can
be seen from Eqs. (6-8). Therefore we use this initial
state and obtain the propagated semiclassical wavefunc-
tion in the closed form Eq. (8). In Fig. 1 the quantum and
semiclassical results at a frequency ω0 = 0.148 a.u. and a
ﬁeld strength E0 = 0.15 a.u. are compared. The Keldysh
parameter has the value 1.14. The quantum mechanical
calculation (dotted line) shows a typical ATI spectrum.
Intensity maxima with a separation in energy of ¯hω0 are
clearly visible. The ﬁrst maximum has the highest inten-
sity while the second maximum is suppressed.

part, by a harmonic potential for which semiclassical cal-
culations are exact. Hence, the semiclassical ATI spec-
trum with this potential should be more accurate if the
discrepancies in Fig. 1 are due to the potential and not
due to the laser interaction. The ground state wave func-
tion itself is again well approximated by the Gaussian
Eq. (6) with β = 0.154 a.u. and qβ = 0. The laser has
a frequency ω0 = 0.09 a.u., a ﬁeld strength E0 = 0.049
a.u., and a pulse duration of 4.25 cycles. The Keldysh
parameter has the value 1.87.

FIG. 1. Quantum mechanical (dotted line) and semiclas-
sical (solid line) ATI spectra for the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1)
with E0 = 0.15 a.u., ω0 = 0.148 a.u. and the softcore potential
Eq. (11).

The semiclassical result (solid line) is ambiguous: On
the one hand there are clear ATI maxima with a sepa-
ration of ¯hω0. All peaks but the ﬁrst one have roughly
the correct magnitude. Again the second maximum is
missing. On the other hand we see a constant shift
(about 0.02a.u.) of the spectrum towards higher energies.
Therefore, a quantitative semiclassical description is im-
possible, at least with the present parameters and the
softcore potential. Next, we will clarify whether the shift
in the spectrum is an inherent problem of a semiclassical
ATI calculation or if it can be attributed to properties of
the softcore potential.

2. Gaussian potential

To this end we take a potential which has been used
to model the “single bound state” situation mentioned in
the introduction [17]. It is of Gaussian form

V (x) = −V0 exp(cid:0)−σx2(cid:1) .

(12)

With our choice of parameters V0 = 0.6 a.u. and
σ = 0.025 a.u., the potential contains six bound states
and can be approximated, at least in the lower energy

FIG. 2. Quantum mechanical (dotted line) and semiclassi-
cal (solid line) ATI spectra for the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) with
E0 = 0.049a.u., ω0 = 0.09a.u. and the Gaussian potential Eq.
(12).

We obtain a quantum mechanical ATI spectrum (dot-
ted line in Fig. 2) with six distinct maxima. The semi-
classical spectrum (solid line) is not shifted, the location
of the maxima agrees with quantum mechanics. Hence,
one can conclude that the softcore potential is respon-
sible for the shift. The height of the third maximum is
clearly underestimated and the details of the spectrum
are exaggerated by the semiclassical calculation. Apart
from these deviations the agreement is good enough to
use this type of calculation as a basis for a semiclassical
understanding of ATI.

B. Semiclassical interpretation of the ATI spectrum

1. Classiﬁcation and coherence of trajectories

With the chosen parameters most of the trajectories
ionize during the pulse (∼ 92 %). We consider a trajec-
tory as ionized if the energy of the atom

ε(t) = p(t)2/2 + V (q(t))

(13)

becomes positive at some time tn and remains positive,
i.e. ε(t) > 0 for t > tn. Typically, the trajectories ion-
ize around an extremum of the laser ﬁeld. Tunnelling
can not be very important, otherwise the agreement
between quantum mechanics and semiclassics would be
much worse. The Keldysh parameter of 1.87 suggests

3

that we are in between the tunnelling and the multipho-
ton regime.
Interestingly, the semiclassical description
is successful although we are way below energies of the
classically allowed over the barrier regime.

FIG. 3. Energy ε(t) from Eq. (13) for trajectories ionized in
the intervals I1 (solid line), I2 (dashed line), I3 (dashed-dotted
line) and I4 (dotted line), respectively. For comparison, the
laser ﬁeld is plotted in arbitrary units (thick dashed line).

An obvious criterion for the classiﬁcation of the tra-
jectories is the time interval of the laser cycle into which
their individual ionization time tn falls, see Fig. 3. Typi-
cally ionization of trajectory happens around tn = (2n−
1)T /4 when the force induced by the laser reaches a max-
imum. Hence, the ionized trajectories can be attached to
time intervals In = [(n− 1)T /2, n T /2]. In Fig. 3 we have
plotted four trajectories from the intervals I1 to I4 which
end up with an energy E = 0.36 a.u.. After ionization
each trajectory shows a quiver motion around a mean
momentum pf [18]. One can distinguish two groups of in-
tervals, namely those with trajectories ionized with pos-
itive momentum pf (the intervals I2k−1) and those with
trajectories with negative pf (the intervals I2k). These
two groups contribute separately and incoherently to the
energy spectrum as one might expect since the electrons
are easily distinguishable. One can see this directly from
the deﬁnition Eq. (9) of the electron energy spectrum.
For relative high energies ¯hω the (short-range) potential
may be neglected in the Hamiltonian H0 and we get

Hence, to this approximation, the ATI spectrum is in-
deed given by the incoherent sum of two terms belonging
to diﬀerent signs of the momenta of electrons ionized in
diﬀerent time intervals as described above.

imation.

tories from the intervals I2, I4, I6 and I8 (dotted) compared to
the incoherent sum ˜σ+ of spectra that belong to the intervals
I2 to I8 (solid line).

Only for small ω the spectra do not agree, where the
kinetic energy is comparable with the (neglected) poten-
tial energy.

Quantum mechanically, all contributions from trajec-
tories which lead to the same momentum pf of the elec-
tron are indistinguishable and must be summed coher-
ently. To double check that the interference from dif-
ferent intervals In is responsible for the ATI peaks, we
can artiﬁcially create a spectrum by an incoherent super-
position ˜σ+ = σ2 + σ4 + σ6 + σ8 of contributions from
trajectories ionized in the intervals I2j. This artiﬁcially
incoherent sum (Fig. 4(b)) shows similarity neither with
σ+(ω) nor with any kind of ATI spectrum.

2. Classical signature of bound and continuum motion in the

laser ﬁeld

The great advantage of an ab initio semiclassical de-
scription lies in the possibility to make dynamical be-
havior transparent based on classical trajectories, par-
ticularly in the case of explicit time dependent problems
where our intuition is not as well trained as in the case of
conservative Hamiltonian systems. The classical quanti-

ties enter semiclassically mostly through the phase factor

exp (i[Sqp(t) − p(t)q(t)]/¯h) ≡ exp[iΦ/¯h]

(15)

which each trajectory contributes to the wave function
Eq. (8). Although the prefactor Cqp(t) in Eq. (8) may be
complex itself, the major contribution to the phase comes
from the eﬀective action Φ in the exponent of Eq. (15).
Figure 5 shows the energy ε of the atom and the accu-
mulated phase Φ. One can recognize a clear distinction
between a quasi-free oscillation in the laser ﬁeld after the
ionization and the quasi-bound motion in the potential.
The latter is characterized by an almost constant aver-
aged bound energy hε(t)i (Fig. 5(a)) of the individual
trajectory giving rise to an averaged linear increase of the
phase (Fig. 5(b)). After ionization the phase decreases
linearly with an oscillatory modulation superimposed by
the laser ﬁeld. The almost linear increase of Φ without
strong modulation of the laser ﬁeld during the bound mo-
tion of the electron is remarkable, particularly looking at
the laser induced modulations of the bound energy seen
in Fig. 5(a). The averaged slope of the phase (positive
for bound motion, negative for continuum motion) cor-
responds via dΦ/dt = −E to an averaged energy. The
behavior can be understood by a closer inspection of the
action

where p is the mean momentum. Without potential the

phase from Eq. (17) reduces to Φ(t) = −R p2(τ )/2 dτ

and we obtain with Eq. (19)

Here, T = p2(t)/2 refers to the kinetic energy and H
to the entire Hamiltonian of Eq. (1), the dot indicates a
derivative with respect to time, and q ≡ q(t = 0). With
the help of Hamilton’s equations and a little algebra Φ
from Eq. (16) can be simpliﬁed to

Φ(t) = −Z t

dq (cid:19) dτ

(17)

where ε is the atomic energy Eq. (13). With Eq. (17) we
can quantitatively explain the slope of Φ in Fig. 5(b). For
the low energies considered the potential Eq. (12) can be
approximated harmonically,

V (q) ≈ −V0 + V0σq2

(18)

Averaging Φ over some time yields then Φ(t) ≈ V0t,
for any bound energy of a classical trajectory since for
an oscillator averaged kinetic and potential energy are
equal. Indeed, the numerical value for the positive slope
in Fig. 5(b) is 0.6 a.u. in agreement with the value for V0.
For the ionized part of the trajectories we may assume
that the potential vanishes. The corresponding solutions
for electron momentum p(t) follows directly from Hamil-
ton’s equation ˙p = −E0 sin ω0t,

3. Semiclassical model for ATI

The clear distinction between classical bound and con-
tinuum motion in the laser ﬁeld as demonstrated by Fig. 5
and illuminated in the last section, allows one to derive
easily the peak positions of the ATI spectrum. Moreover,
this distinction also supports the so called strong ﬁeld ap-
proximation (e.g. [9,19]) where electron dynamics in the
laser ﬁeld is modelled by one bound state and the contin-
uum. While this is postulated in [9] as an approximation
and justiﬁed a posteriori by the results the correspond-
ing approximation is suggested in the present context of a
semiclassical analysis by the full classical dynamics, i.e.,
the behavior of the trajectories, as shown in 5. There, we
have seen that each classical bound motion leads to the
characteristic linear increase of the phase. If the entire
phase space corresponding to the initial (ground state)
wave function is probed with many trajectories of diﬀer-
ent energy, the dominant contribution will appear at the
bound state energy which implies

Φb(t) ≈ Ip t ,

(21)

5

where Ip is the ionization potential. The time for which
a trajectory does not fall into one of the two classes,
bound or continuum, is very short (Fig. 5). Hence, we
can approximately compose the true phase Φ = Φb +
Φc. However, we don’t know for an electron with mean
momentum p when it was ionized. Hence, we have to
sum over all trajectories with diﬀerent ionization times
τ but equal ﬁnal momentum p = pf which leads to the
propagated wavefunction

the ATI maxima in a spectrum with trajectories from the
intervals I2 and I8 is given by ¯hω0/3 (Abb. 6 (c)). The
interference of trajectories ionized in many subsequent
cycles suppresses the non-integer maxima according to
Eq. (23). If the ﬁeld strength is high enough the atom
is completely ionized during the ﬁrst cycle. The oppor-
tunity for interference gets lost and we end up with an
unstructured energy spectrum.

where the phase ∆ is given by

∆mn = Ip + Up + p2/2 − (n + 2m)¯hω0 .

(23)

From Eq. (23) and Eq. (22) follows that ATI peaks ap-
pear at integer multiples n¯hω0 of the laser frequency,
when

p2
2

= n¯hω0 − Ip − Up .

(24)

One can also see from Eq. (22) that the ATI maxima be-
come sharper with each optical cycle that supplies ioniz-
ing trajectories. Of course, this eﬀect is weakened by the
spreading of the wavepacket hidden in the prefactor of
each trajectory contribution (see Eq. (8)) not considered
here.

Trajectories that are ionized during diﬀerent laser cy-
cles accumulate a speciﬁc mean phase diﬀerence. The
phase diﬀerence depends on the number k of laser cycles
passed between the two ionization processes:

∆Φ(p) = k T (cid:18)Ip +

p2
2

+ Up(cid:19) .

(25)

The trajectories interfere constructively if

∆Φ(p) = 2πl ⇒

ω0 − Ip − Up .

(26)

If an energy spectrum is calculated exclusively with tra-
jectories from two intervals separated by k cycles there
should be additional maxima in the ATI spectrum with
a distance ¯hω0/k.

As a test for this semiclassical interpretation of the
ATI mechanism we have calculated three spectra with
trajectories where the mean time delay between ionizing
events is given by ∆t = T , ∆t = 2T and ∆t = 3T . For
the spectrum Fig. 6 (a) we have used exclusively trajec-
tories from the intervals I2 and I4 (∆t = T ). One can
see broad maxima separated by ¯hω0 in energy. Trajec-
tories from the intervals I2 and I6 (see Fig. 6 (b)) form
a spectrum where the maxima are separated by ¯hω0/2 –
as predicted for ∆t = 2T . In analogy the separation for

FIG. 6. Semiclassical spectra calculated with trajectories
from the intervals I2 and I4 (a), I2 and I6 (b), and I2 and I8
(c).

In an extreme semiclassical approximation we would
have evaluated the integral in Eq. (22) by stationary
phase. The condition

d/dτ [Φb(τ ) − Φc(τ )] ≡ Ip + p2(τ )/2 = 0

(27)

leads to complex ionization times tn whose real part is
periodic and allows for two ionizing events per laser cycle,
close to the extrema of the laser amplitude. The deriva-
tion is simple but technical, therefore we don’t carry it
out explicitely here. However, it explains the observa-
tion that ionization occurs close to the extrema of the
laser ﬁeld and it also makes contact with the tunnelling
process often referred to in the literature since the com-
plex time can be interpreted as tunnelling at a complex
”transition” energy.

Clearly, our semiclassical analysis as described here
supports the picture which has been sketched in [20]
interpreting a quantum calculation. The authors as-
sume that wave packets are emitted every time the laser
reaches an extremum. The interference of the diﬀerent
wave packets gives rise to the ATI peaks.

In the following we will discuss the process of higher
harmonic generation (HHG) which is closely related to
ATI. In fact, the separation into a bound and continuum

FIG. 8. Quantum (a) and semiclassical (b) spectrum of

higher harmonics according to Eq. (30).

Clearly, our semiclassical approach represents a good
approximation. The dipole acceleration shows the char-
acteristic feature that fast oscillations (which are respon-
sible for the high harmonics in Fourier space) show only
up after some time, here after t = T . This is the ﬁrst
time where trajectories are trapped. Trapping can only
occur if (i) tn = nT /2, (ii) the trajectories reach a turning
point (i.e. p(tn) = 0), and (iii) if at this time the electron
is close to the nucleus (q(tn) ≈ 0). The trapped trajecto-
ries constitute a partially bound state which can interfere
with the main part of the wavepacket (trajectories) still
bouncing back and forward over the nucleus driven by
the laser. The group of brieﬂy bound (i.e. trapped or
stranded) trajectories can be clearly identiﬁed, either by
their small excursion in space (Fig. 9a) or by the positive
slope of their action (Fig. 9b) as it was the case for ATI
(compare with Fig. 5). By artiﬁcially discarding the ini-
tial conditions in the semiclassical propagator which lead
to trapped trajectories one can convincingly demonstrate
that the plateau in HHG generation is a simple interfer-
ence eﬀect [21]. Here, we are interested ﬁrstly in linking
ATI to HHG by using the same separation in bound and
continuum parts of the dynamics already worked out for
ATI. Secondly, we want to go one step further and con-
struct a wavefunction based on this principle.

Semiclassically, we have to look ﬁrst at the phases of
the observable. Therefore, we deﬁne a linear combination
for the wavefunction from the respective phase factors for
bound and continuum motion. Considering only terms
in the exponent the harmonic spectrum Eq. (30) reads
simply

part of the electron description is constitutive for HHG
as well, the prominent features, such as cutoﬀ and peak
locations, can be derived from the same phase properties
Eq. (22) as for ATI. However, there is a characteristic
diﬀerence, how these phases enter.

IV. HIGH HARMONIC GENERATION

First, we brieﬂy recapitulate the ﬁndings of [21], where
we have calculated the harmonic spectrum with the soft-
core potential Eq. (11). With our choice of a = 2 the ion-
ization potential is given by Ip = 0.5 a.u.. The laser ﬁeld
has a strength E0 = 0.1 a.u., a frequency ω0 = 0.0378
a.u. and a phase δ = π/2. The initial wave packet with a
width of β = 0.05 a.u. is located at qβ = E0/ω2
0 = 70 a.u..
Note, that the cutoﬀ energy EC in such a symmetric laser
scattering experiment is given by

where c 6= 0 is a (so far) arbitrary constant. In princi-
ple, c = c(t), however its change in time is much slower
than that of the optical oscillations of the phases Φ(t),
hence we may approximate c by a constant. The bound
and continuum phases, Φb and Φc, are deﬁned in Eq.
(21) and Eq. (20), respectively. For Φc we have p = 0,
since this is the dominant contribution from the center
of the wavepacket which was initially at rest. The re-
sult is shown in Fig. 10. Indeed, the plateau with the
harmonics is generated, however, the initial exponential
decrease is missing since we have neglected all prefac-
tors of the semiclassical wavefunction which describe the
dispersion of the wavepacket.

We can go one step further and construct a full time-
dependent wavefunction from this semiclassical approxi-
mation, namely

Ψ(x, t) = Ψsc

β (x, t) + c Ψ0(x) exp(itIp/¯h).

(37)

Here, Ψ0(x) exp(iIpt/¯h) is the time dependent ground
β (x, t)
state wave function (without the laser ﬁeld) and Ψsc
is a (semiclassical) wavepacket in the laser ﬁeld but with-
out potential. Calculating the dipole acceleration and
the resulting harmonic spectrum with this wavefunction
leads to a remarkably good approximation of the true
quantum spectrum (compare Fig. 8 with Fig. 11). The
dispersion of the wavepacket leads to the lower plateau
compared to Fig. 10.

A. Semiclassical comparison between ATI and HHG

Clearly, the main structure such as the plateau, cutoﬀ
(HHG) and the occurrence of peaks and their separation
in energy (ATI and HHG) is a property of the diﬀer-
ence of the classical time-dependent actions Φb(t)− Φc(t)
alone.
However, the HHG power spectrum Eq. (30) is an inte-
gral over all the time for which the electron wavepacket is
exposed to the laser ﬁeld. In contrast, the ATI spectrum
is obtained in the long-time limit t → ∞ after the laser
has been switched oﬀ. This diﬀerence may explain why
the HHG results tend to be better than the ATI results
semiclassically: Any semiclassical approximation (which
is not exact) become worse for large times.

A second point refers to the fact that the character-
istic phase diﬀerence Φb(t) − Φc(t) appears already in
the wavefunction Eq. (22) for ATI, while for HHG it oc-
curs only in the expectation value Eq. (29). However,
this diﬀerence is artiﬁcial, since the expectation value,
or better its Fourier transform the power spectrum, is
not the observable of higher harmonic radiation. The
correct expression is the dipole-dipole correlation func-
tion R which can be approximated as R ∝ |σ(ω)|2 under
single atom conditions or in the case of an ensemble of
independent atoms which radiate [10,22]. Hence, in both
cases, ATI and HHG, the peak structure appears already
on the level of the quantum amplitude (or wavefunction)
and is ampliﬁed in the true observable.

Financial support from the DFG under the Gerhard
Hess-Programm and the SFB 276 is gratefully acknowl-
edged.

B. Summary

f (q, p) =

We have given a time-dependent fully semiclassical
description of multiphoton processes. The prominent
ATI and HHG features emerge naturally from proper-
ties of the classical trajectories whose contributions to
the semiclassical wavefunction interfere semiclassically.
Any eﬀect of this semiclassical interference can be double-
checked by disregarding the phases. This leads (with the
same trajectories) to a classical observable. As we have
seen, to a good approximation the classical action for
an individual trajectory can be composed of one part Φb
for the time the electron is bound (disregarding the laser
ﬁeld) and of another part Φc for the time the electron
is in the continuum (disregarding the atomic potential).
The relevant phase diﬀerence Φb−Φc leads in both cases,
ATI and HHG, to the prominent harmonic structures in
terms of the laser energy ¯hω0. Finally, we have been
able to construct a simple wavefunction for higher har-
monics generated in laser assisted scattering. Its key ele-
ment is an explicitely time-dependent wavepacket of the
electron under the inﬂuence of the laser ﬁeld. Starting
from an initial Gaussian distribution localized in space
the wavepacket disperses in time providing the correct
decrease of the intensity of the lower harmonics and in
turn the correct height of the plateau.

This semiclassical time dependent wavepacket is quan-

tribution at time t = 0 [23]. The fact that the semi-
classical wavefunction is exact is a direct consequence
of the Ehrenfest theorem which implies that interactions
V ∝ xn, n = 0, 1, 2 have quantum mechanically exact
semiclassical solutions.

Abstract

We report results of ab initio calculation of the spin-rotational Hamilto-
nian parameters including P - and P, T -odd terms for the BaF molecule. The
ground state wave function of BaF molecule is found with the help of the
Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential method followed by the restoration of
molecular four-component spinors in the core region of barium in the frame-
work of a non-variational procedure. Core polarization eﬀects are included
with the help of the atomic Many Body Perturbation Theory for Barium atom.
For the hyperﬁne constants the accuracy of this method is about 5-10%.

a. Introduction.

It is well known that possible P - and P, T -odd eﬀects are strongly
enhanced in heavy diatomic radicals (see, for example, [1,2]). In the molecular experiment
with the TlF molecule [3] stringent limits on the Schiﬀ moment of the Tl nucleus and
on the tensor constant of the electron-nucleus P, T -odd interaction were obtained. In the
experiments with the polar diatomics with the unpaired electron one can search for the
P, T -odd eﬀects caused by the permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron
de [4] and by the scalar electron-nuclear P, T -odd interaction [5]. The most stringent limit
on the electron EDM was obtained in the experiment with atomic Thallium [6] (for the
review of the theoretical predictions for de see [7]). Heavy polar diatomic molecules provide
enhancement of the electron EDM, which is several orders of magnitude larger, than in Tl.
An experimental search for the EDM of the electron is now underway on the YbF molecule
[8]. The P -odd eﬀects associated with the anapole moment of the nucleus are also strongly
enhanced in diatomic radicals [9,10].

The ﬁrst calculations of the P, T -odd interactions in molecules were carried out for TlF
molecule with the use of a “relativistic matching” of nonrelativistic one-conﬁgurational wave
function [11].

Then a semi-empirical scheme [12,13] and ab initio method based on the Relativistic
Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) calculation of the molecular wave function [14] were de-
veloped. The ﬁrst RECP-based calculations of the P, T -odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian
parameters for PbF and HgF molecules were carried out in the framework of the one-
conﬁgurational approximation with minimal atomic basis sets, i.e. the correlation structure
was not taken into account. In calculation of YbF molecule [15], a ﬂexible atomic basis set
was used and the correlation eﬀects were considered within the Restricted Active Space SCF
(RASSCF) method [16,17].

It was concluded in [15] that in order to perform more accurate calculations of the
hyperﬁne and the P, T -odd constants, the spin-correlation of the unpaired electron with the
outermost core shells 5s and 5p of ytterbium should be taken into account. Such correlations
can be hardly eﬃciently considered within MC SCF-like methods because of the necessity
to correlate too many electrons.

Here we suggest to use an eﬀective operator (EO) technique to account for the most
important types of the core-valence correlations. EOs for the valence electrons are formed
with the help of the atomic many body perturbation theory. This method allows to include
correlations not only with the outermost core shells, but with all core electrons, which
appears to be quite important for the hyperﬁne and P, T -odd interactions. The EO technique
was recently developed for atoms [18] and proved to be very eﬃcient for the calculations
of the hyperﬁne structure of the heavy atoms [19]. This technique is naturally and easily
combined with the RECP method for the molecular calculations. As a result, a signiﬁcant
improvement of the accuracy is achieved.

Below we report the results of application of this method to calculation of the BaF

molecule.

b. Spin-rotational Hamiltonian. Molecular spin-rotational degrees of freedom are de-

scribed by the following spin-rotational Hamiltonian (see [2]):

Hsr = BN2 + γSN
S
+ WAkAn

DenE + S ˆAI

−
I + (WSkS + Wdde)Sn.

In this expression N is the rotational angular momentum, B is the rotational constant, S
and I are the spins of the electron and the Ba nucleus, n is the unit vector directed along the
molecular axis from Ba to F. The spin-doubling constant γ characterizes the spin-rotational
interaction. De and E are the molecular dipole moment and the external electric ﬁeld.
The axial tensor ˆA describes magnetic hyperﬁne structure. It can be determined by two
A⊥)/3. The last three terms in (1) account
parameters: A = (Ak + 2A⊥)/3 and Ad = (Ak −
for the P - and P, T -odd eﬀects. First of them describes interaction of the electron spin with
the anapole moment of the nucleus kA [10]. The second one corresponds to the scalar P, T -
odd electron-nucleus interaction with the dimensionless constant kS. The third one describes
interaction of the electron EDM de with the molecular ﬁeld. Constant Wd characterizes an
eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the unpaired electron.

It is important to note that all P - and P, T -odd constants Wi mostly depend on the
electron spin-density in the vicinity of the heavy nucleus. The same, of course, can be
said about hyperﬁne constants A and Ad. So, the comparison of the theoretical results for
the hyperﬁne constants with the experiment is a good test for the accuracy of the whole
calculation.

c. RECP calculation of electronic wave function. The scheme of the RECP calculation
for BaF molecule is very similar to that for YbF described in [15] (see also [14]) and below
we will focus only on speciﬁc features of the present calculations.

The Generalized RECP (GRECP) [20] (with the inner core 1s2[. . .]4s24p64d10 shells which
were not included explicitly in the RECP calculations) was selected from a few other RECP
variants for calculations of BaF because our test electronic structure calculations showed
that it combined high accuracy with quite small computational expenses (see table I and
the spectroscopic data below).

Numerical pseudospinors derived from the GRECP/SCF calculations of some electronic
conﬁgurations for Ba, Ba+ and Ba++ were approximated by generally contracted s, p, d and
[6, 5, 4, 2] basis set for barium1. For ﬂuorine we
f gaussian functions forming (10, 8, 6, 2)
used basis sets (14, 9, 4)
[6, 5, 2] and [4, 3, 3] from the ANO-I Library [17]. These basis
sets proved to be suﬃciently ﬂexible to reproduce electronic structure in valence region of
BaF as compared to other basis sets involved in our test SCF and RASSCF calculations.

The RASSCF calculations of the spectroscopic constants were performed with the spin-
Averaged part of the GRECP (AREP) and contribution of relatively small spin-orbit interac-
tion (i.e. Eﬀective Spin-Orbit Potential or ESOP as a part of GRECP) was estimated in the
framework of the perturbation theory. The results of our AREP/RASSCF calculations with
79558 conﬁgurations 2 for the equilibrium distance and vibration constant (Re = 2.25 ˚A,
ωe = 433 cm−1) are in a good agreement with the experimental data [21] (Re = 2.16 ˚A,

MO LCAO coeﬃcients from BaF calculations can be found on http://www.qchem.pnpi.spb.ru.

2We used C2v point group with (a1, b1, b2, a2) irreducible representations; 17 electrons were
distributed on active orbitals within RAS 1=(3,1,1,0), RAS 2=(3,1,1,0) and RAS 3=(5,3,3,1)
subspaces.

ωe = 469 cm−1). For the dipole moment we have obtained De = 2.93 D.
d. Restoration of four-component spinor for valence electron.

In order to evaluate
matrix elements of the operators singular near nucleus of barium, we have performed
GRECP/SCF and GRECP/RASSCF calculations of BaF where the pseudospinors corre-
sponding to 5s1/2, 5p1/2 and 5p3/2 shells were “frozen” with the help of the level-shift tech-
nique (that is also known as Huzinaga-type ECP, see [22] and references therein). It was nec-
essary to do because polarization of these shells were taken into account by means of EO tech-
nique (see below). Spin-orbit interaction was neglected for the explicitly treated electrons be-
cause of its smallness (see [15]). Thus, only core molecular pseudoorbitals occupying mainly
atomic 1s, 2s and 2p orbitals of ﬂuorine and the valence pseudoorbital of unpaired elec-
tron (that is mainly 6s, 6p-hybridized orbital of barium) were varied. RASSCF calculations
with 5284 conﬁgurations were performed for 11 electrons distributed in RAS 1=(2,0,0,0),
RAS 2=(2,1,1,0) and RAS 3=(6,4,4,2) subspaces.

The molecular relativistic spinor for the unpaired electron was constructed from the

so that the atomic s- and p-pseudoorbitals of barium in (2) were replaced by the unsmoothed
four-component DF spinors derived for the same atomic conﬁgurations which were used in
generation of basis s, p-pseudoorbitals. The MO LCAO coeﬃcients were preserved after the
RECP calculations. As the spin-orbit interaction for the unpaired electron is small, the
“spin-averaged” valence atomic p-pseudoorbital was replaced by the linear combination of
the corresponding spinors with j = l

1/2 (see [15,14] for details).

e. Eﬀective operators for valence electrons

It is well known that the accuracy of the
hyperﬁne structure calculations for heavy atoms is not high if core polarization eﬀects are
not taken into account. In [23] it was suggested, that correlations which are not included
in the active space, can be treated with the help of the EO. The latter is constructed by
means of the atomic many body perturbation theory (for the application of the perturbation
theory to the calculations of the P, T -violation in atoms see, for example, [24]). The main
advantage of this method is that there is no need to extend the active space to include core
electrons.

±

In [23] it was supposed that EO is constructed in the active space which includes only
few interacting levels. On the contrary, in [18,19] it is suggested to use single EO for the
whole (inﬁnite dimensional) valence space. Thus, all correlations between valence electrons
are treated explicitly, while EO accounts only for the core excitations. In this case, EO is
energy dependent, but this dependence is weak if the energy gap between the core and the
valence space is not too small. This makes EO method much more ﬂexible and allows to use
one EO for diﬀerent quantum systems, provided that they have the same core. In particular,
it is possible to form EO for the atom (or ion) and then use it in a molecular calculation.

Generally speaking, EO for the hyperﬁne interaction (as well as for any other one-electron
operator) is no longer one-electron operator, even in the lowest order of the perturbation
theory. On the other hand, the one-electron part of EO includes two most important cor-
relation corrections and in many cases appears to be a very good approximation. The ﬁrst

4

correction corresponds to the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), and the second one
corresponds to the substitution of the Dirac-Fock orbitals by the Brueckner orbitals.

To illustrate how EO works for the atomic barium, let us look at the hyperﬁne constant
of the 3P1(6s6p)-level of 137Ba. The two-electron multiconﬁgurational Dirac-Fock calculation
gives A = 804 MHz [25], which should be compared to the experimental value 1151 MHz.
The two-electron conﬁguration interaction calculation with RPA and Brueckner corrections
included gives A = 1180 MHz.

In this work we calculated EOs for the magnetic hyperﬁne interaction, for the EDM of the
electron and for the anapole moment. Both RPA equations and Brueckner equations were
solved for a ﬁnite basis set in the V N −2 approximation (which means that SCF corresponds
to Ba++), and matrix elements of the EOs were calculated. The basis set included Dirac-
Fock orbitals for 1s . . . 6s, 6p shells. In addition 7
15f orbitals
were formed in analogy to the basis set N2 of [18]. Molecular orbitals were reexpanded in
this basis set to ﬁnd matrix elements of EOs for the molecular wave function.

f. Results. Expressions for the electronic matrix elements which correspond to the
parameters A, Ad and Wi of the operator (1) can be found in [2]. All radial integrals and
atomic four-component spinors were calculated for the ﬁnite nucleus in a model of uniformly
charged ball.

Results for the parameters of the spin-rotational Hamiltonian are given in table II. There
are two measurements of the hyperﬁne constants for 137BaF [26,27]. First of them was made
for a matrix-isolated molecule and second was performed in a molecular beam. Results
of these measurements were used in the semiempirical calculations [12,2] of P - and P, T -
odd parameters of the spin-rotational Hamiltonian. These calculations were based on the
similarity between electronic matrix elements for the hyperﬁne structure interaction and for
the P - and P, T -odd interactions. All of these operators mainly depend on the electron spin
density in the vicinity of the nucleus. As a result, in a one-electron approximation parameters
Wi are proportional to √AAd [12]. Electronic correlations can break this proportionality.

In table II we give results of the SCF and RASSCF calculations for 11 electrons with the
restoration procedure described above. It is seen that in these calculations parameters A
and Ad are signiﬁcantly smaller than in experiments [26,27]. On the next stage we used EOs
to account for the core polarization eﬀects. That led to the 50% growth for the constant A,
while constant Ad increased by 130%. Our ﬁnal numbers for the hyperﬁne constants are very
close to the experiment [26] (the diﬀerence being less than 5%) but diﬀer more signiﬁcantly
from [27].

Our SCF and RASSCF results for all three constants Wi are much smaller than results of
the semiempirical calculations [12,2]. When core polarization eﬀects are taken into account
with the help of corresponding EOs, our values for Wd and WA dramatically increase (at
present we do not have RPA for the constant WS). There is a good agreement between our
ﬁnal value for Wd and that from the semiempirical calculation, but for the constant WA, our
result is noticeably smaller.

It can be explained by the fact that proportionality between Wd and √AAd holds within
10% accuracy, but for the constant WA deviation from proportionality reaches 30%. Almost
half of this deviation is caused by the ﬁnite nuclear size corrections to radial integrals.
Electron correlation corrections for both constants are about 15%.

Two conclusions can be made from the results of this work. First, as it was suggested

5

in [15], core polarization eﬀects play very important role in calculations of parameters of
the spin-rotational Hamiltonian for heavy diatomic radicals. Second, results of the ab initio
calculations with core polarization included, are close to the results of the semiempirical
calculations, correlation corrections being about 15%. The fact that two very diﬀerent
methods give similar results conﬁrms that it is possible to make reliable calculations for
such molecules.

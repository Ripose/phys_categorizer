We discuss harmonic generation in the case of laser ﬁeld-dressed Hamiltonians that are invariant
under so-called dynamical symmetry operations. Examples for such systems are molecules which
exhibit a discrete rotational symmetry of order N (e.g. benzene with N = 6) interacting with a
circularly polarized laser ﬁeld and single atoms in a bichromatic ﬁeld, with the two lasers having
opposite circular polarizations. Within a general group theory approach we study the harmonics
one obtains from the interaction of a laser pulse and a circular molecule. When the system is in
a pure ﬁeld-dressed state the known selection rule kN ± 1, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . results. However, other
lines are observed when recombinations with states of a symmetry diﬀerent from the initial one
become important. This is the case for laser pulses which are ﬁnite in time, in particular when
the fundamental laser frequency (or one of its multiples) is resonant with a transition between
ﬁeld-dressed states. Numerical ab initio simulations, conﬁrming our analytical calculations and
illustrating the power of the group theory approach, are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

±

1, where k

The generation of harmonics by atoms and molecules in a laser ﬁeld is a topic that has been strongly studied during
the last ﬁfteen years (see [1] for recent reviews). The big interest lies in the potential of atoms and molecules in
laser ﬁelds as sources of short-wavelength radiation. It is well known that when a strong linearly polarized laser ﬁeld
interacts with an atom only odd harmonics are generated. In more complex systems a detailed study of the symmetry
transformations is required for predicting which harmonics are allowed or not. In a recent work [2] it was shown that
peculiar selection rules can be obtained for molecules which are invariant under a discrete rotational symmetry
CN
(like benzene where N = 6). When this kind of molecules interacts with a circularly polarized laser pulse of inﬁnite
duration, the selection rules for the harmonics are n = kN
∈ N+. This class of molecules is particularly
interesting because they can work as a ﬁlter, i.e., the ﬁrst allowed harmonic is n = N
1, and therefore, if N is large,
the emitted frequency can be very high. All systems whose Hamiltonian is invariant under a “dynamical rotation”,
i.e., a spatial rotation plus a time translation, generate selection rules of the kind kN
1. Together with cyclic
molecules another example of such a system is the single atom interacting with two-color laser ﬁelds with opposite
circular polarization and frequencies one an integer multiple of the other.
In both the molecular and the atomic
case it is possible to obtain these selection rules also from the conservation of the angular momentum component
perpendicular to the polarization plane.
In a previous paper [3] we have presented results from numerical simulations for a benzene model-molecule showing
that when a ﬁnite pulse is taken into account, other lines than those expected from the kN
1 selection rule can
be present. In this paper we will show that, if embedded in a general group theory treatment, also this case can be
understood in a systematic way. Our analysis will allow us to achieve a full understanding of the molecule harmonic
spectrum. Moreover, we will show that the ﬁeld-dressed level scheme can be inferred from the harmonic spectrum.
The particular features and diﬀerences of a ﬁnite pulse compared to an inﬁnite one will be also addressed. If not
otherwise stated, all the laser ﬁelds considered are circularly polarized in the xy-plane, and atomic units are used
throughout the paper. We apply the dipole approximation which is excellent for the laser frequencies and intensities
under consideration.

II. DYNAMICAL SYMMETRIES

The Hamiltonian Hmo of a cyclic molecule interacting with a single laser ﬁeld and the Hamiltonian Hat of a single
atom interacting with two lasers of opposite polarization are, from a symmetry point of view, equivalent. Both are

invariant under certain dynamical rotations. We will consider only a single electron active. This assumption does not
introduce any loss of generality to our derivations [2]. Therefore Hmo in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z) reads

l has to look like Ψ0 =

and this is equivalent to the case of a cyclic molecule with N = η + 1. Hence the selection rules for this case are equal
to those derived in [2] for the cyclic molecules, n = kN
1. An experiment with the two frequencies ω and 2ω was
±
performed [4], and its theoretical aspects were recently discussed within a semiclassical three-step model [5]. Selection
rules for the case of an atom interacting with a circularly polarized ﬁeld of frequency ω and a linearly polarized ﬁeld
of frequency N ω were also derived [6], conﬁrming experimental results obtained previously [7].
In the derivation of the kN
1-selection rule one assumes that only a single bound state is involved in the harmonic
generation process. In this case selection rules can be obtained also arguing about the angular momentum only. Let
us ﬁrst discuss about the cyclic molecule: because of the symmetry of the molecule, an expansion of the ground state
in spherical harmonics Y m
l + c.c., i.e, the ground state is expanded over
functions that have an azimuthal symmetry equal to kN . The wavefunction is then invariant under a rotation of
2π/N . Let us assume that the laser ﬁeld has a polarization σ+, i.e., the projection of the angular momentum of a
photon on the ﬁeld propagation direction is equal to 1. If a harmonic of polarization σ+ is emitted, the molecule, for
keeping the symmetry, hence has to absorb kN + 1 photons so that the ﬁnal change in the projection of the angular
momentum is kN . On the contrary, if the harmonic emitted has polarization σ−, the molecule must absorb kN
1
photons. The consequence is that for each k the higher harmonic kN + 1 has the same polarization as the laser ﬁeld,
and the lower kN
1 the opposite one, as it was obtained with a diﬀerent method in [2]. For the atom the derivation
is similar [8,9]. Let us assume an electron is in an s state (the quantum numbers l and m are zero). Let the ﬁrst laser
of frequency ω have a polarization σ+ and the second laser of frequency η ω a polarization σ−. If a harmonic σ+ is
emitted the sum of all the components along z of the angular momentum carried by absorbed photons has to be +1.
If from the ﬁrst laser the atom absorbs p photons, it must absorb p
1 from the second laser. The total absorbed

III. GROUP THEORY

From a group theory point of view the Hamiltonian H 0
described by the group
total Hamiltonian, given by (1), can be written as Hmo = H 0
interaction.
First we study the symmetry group of the total Hamiltonian Hmo. H 0

CN the type of its irreducible representations depends on N .

Combining
GN where N is the number
GN is a cyclic group, it is also
of ions in the molecule which determines the discrete rotational symmetry. Because
Abelian, and therefore it has the following properties: (i) each element forms a class by its own and hence there are
N irreducible representations, (ii) each reducible representation is one-dimensional, i.e., each representation is a set
of complex numbers. The group
CN and therefore the same character
table apply. It is interesting to look how, from a physical point of view, the symmetry of the molecular Hamiltonian
changes when the laser ﬁeld is present. The group
DN h contains 4N elements, i.e., N rotations about an axis of
the N th order, N rotations through an angle π about horizontal axes, N reﬂections σv at the vertical planes and N
rotary-reﬂection transformations Ck
N σh [10]. Looking at the ﬁeld-dressed Hamiltonian (1) it appears that only the
rotations about the vertical axis are still symmetry transformations. In fact, the reﬂection at the vertical planes and
the rotations about horizontal axes would require a space-dependent time transformation. The reﬂection σh at the
horizontal plane would change the polarization of the laser ﬁeld. Hence from the 4N possible operations we had for
H 0
If N is odd there are one real
For a certain group
2 complex representations. Half of
and N
the complex representations is the complex conjugate of the other half. Usually in the literature, the two complex
conjugated representations are considered equivalent and indicated with E, normally reserved for two-dimensional
representations [10]. In our case, because the Hamiltonian (1) is not time-reversal invariant, these representations are
not equivalent. Therefore we have to keep all the N representations separated.
We call each of the N irreducible representations Rℓ where ℓ is an index between 0 and N
1. The generator of the
ℓ-th representation is given by ei2πℓ/N . Therefore, it follows that the (m + 1)-th entry of the ℓ-th representation is
ei2πℓm/N (the ﬁrst entry is given by the identity). Because of the unidimensionality of the representations the product
of two representations, Rα and Rβ, is the irreducible representation Rα+β. If α + β
N , Rα+β is equivalent to
Rα+β−N . Thus each entry of the product table is again a representation Rℓ with 0
Three conclusions can be drawn now: (i) from the deﬁnition of the representation generator we have that the complex
conjugated representation of Rℓ is RN −ℓ, (ii) the representation R0 has all characters equal to 1 (this is the well known
“totally symmetric irreducible representation”) and it is present for every N , (iii) when N is even RN/2 is the other
real representation.
The description given so far in terms of group theory will be very useful later on when it will be necessary to
analyze the transitions between the ﬁeld-dressed states of the molecule.
Indeed, whether an electronic transition
between two states, each of them corresponding to an irreducible representation, is allowed or not can be determined
examining the product of the symmetries of the initial state, the inducing operator, and the complex conjugated of
the ﬁnal state. If the product leads to the totally symmetric irreducible representation the transition is possible, i.e.,

IV. HARMONIC GENERATION

Provided the laser pulse is suﬃciently adiabatic it is a good approximation to calculate the harmonic spectrum from
the Fourier-transformed dipole expectation value. With the wavefunction Ψ(~r, t) we can write the probability to get

For a system whose Hamiltonian is periodic in time with a period τ = 2π/ω we can apply the Floquet theorem (see,
e.g., [12]). The wavefunction of a certain state of the system can be written as Ψi(~r, t) = e−iξitΦi(~r, t) where ξi is
the so-called quasi-energy and Φi(~r, t + τ ) = Φi(~r, t). The functions Φi(~r, t) are eigenfunction of a corresponding
Hamiltonian

Hmo ≡

[Hmo −

i ∂
∂t ], i.e.,

HmoΦi(~r, t) = ξiΦi(~r, t).
In what follows we refer to Φi(~r, t) as a Floquet state. If the system is in a pure Floquet state we can derive the
selection rules as presented in [2]. However, due to pulse shape eﬀects or other perturbations the system might be
not in a pure Floquet state, but rather in a superposition of them,

is stable in one Floquet state the expansion in (12) reduces to only one term. In particular, when we consider the
system being in the Floquet ground state Φ0(~r, t), χ(n) is proportional to the Fourier-transform of the expectation

From a group theory point of view the term in square brackets in (15) is simply the generator of the corresponding
irreducible representation. Moreover, from (16) we see how the harmonic generation operator behaves under the
dynamical rotations of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. Given the irreducible representations of the states
Φi(~r, t) and Φj(~r, t) we can derive to which representation the operator ˆG•
∓ must correspond in order to satisfy

Varying n we force the generic operators ˆG∓ to behave under the dynamical rotations according to the diﬀerent

reproduce those derived in [2]. They have been calculated taking ℓi

where the upper and the lower indexes of ˜ℓ stand for the ﬁnal and initial state, respectively. It is worth to be noted
that if the energy diﬀerence of the ﬁeld-dressed states corresponding to the irreducible representations Rℓi and Rℓf
ℓf ) we have a kind of accidental degeneracy: the lines corresponding to such transition cannot
is equal to ω(ℓi −
be distinguished from those arising from the single state processes. The operators ˆG⋆,•,◦
can behave according to
any representation. Hence all couplings between the Floquet states of the molecule are in principle possible. This of
course does not mean that they have equal probability to occur. Considering that the ground state corresponds to
R0, and the other Rℓ represent excited states we can derive the following symmetry properties for the relevant single
transitions: (i) R0 →
R−ℓ,
(iv) Rℓ →
It is evident that when the frequency ω (or one of its integer multiples) of a ﬁnite laser pulse is nearly resonant with a
certain state, this state becomes more easily accessible, and therefore transitions involving that state are more likely
to happen. On the other hand, when the laser frequency is tuned oﬀ from all the resonances mostly the ﬁeld-dressed
ground state, i.e. R0, is involved and it will be the only one giving a signiﬁcant contribution to harmonic generation.
The fact that selection rules for diﬀerent initial and ﬁnal states contain the terms ∆i is particularly interesting for
the case where the rotating ﬁeld removes a degeneracy. The measurement of the distance between the satellite lines
arising from the two states gives an estimation of the ﬁeld-dressed level-splitting.

to the following energetic sequence: A1 (ground state), E1 (ﬁrst excited, two-dimensional, i.e., two-fold degenerated),
E2 (second excited, two-fold degenerated), B1 (third excited, non-degenerated) [11].
In the ground state A1 and
E1 contain two and four π-electrons, respectively, and the other levels are empty [14]. As it was discussed in the

can easily decompose it into irreducible parts: E1 −→
1 = R1 + R5. The same argument can be applied to the
2 = R2 + R4. What is worth to be stressed is that, contrary to the standard case in quantum
level E2, E2 −→
mechanics textbooks, here the two representations which are complex conjugated, like R1, R5 and R2, R4, correspond
to two diﬀerent energy levels and therefore the so-called ”physically irreducible” representations really generate two
independent states. This particular feature is due to the non-invariance of the total Hamiltonian H under a time
inversion. A similar case is obtained when a magnetic ﬁeld is considered. At this point, with an oscillating ﬁeld
inﬁnite in time, we can think about the ﬁeld-dressed molecule states in pure terms of Ri, where i runs from 0 to
5. This system is stable, i.e., there are no transitions between the states corresponding to diﬀerent representations,
unless external perturbations are present. The selection rules in this case can be derived from the product table, Tab.
3. When the pulse has a ﬁnite length we can consider the pulse shape as a perturbation of a system that has a
D6
symmetry. A transition between two states is possible only if the operator inducing the transition has the “proper”
symmetry. As it can be derived from Tab. 1 the representations A1, E1, E2 and B1 correspond to rotations of angle
0, π

3 and π, respectively. In terms of ℓ they correspond to ℓ = 0, ℓ = 1, ℓ = 2 and ℓ = 3.

VI. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In this Section we want to illustrate and to test our group theoretical method by applying it to harmonic spectra
obtained with the help of ab initio numerical simulations. In order to keep the numerical eﬀort feasible we restrict
ourselves to a two-dimensional (2D) model where the molecule plane and the rotating electric ﬁeld are properly
represented. We study a single active electron in a ring-shaped potential with
CN symmetry (N = 6 in the benzene
case). Results from a fully 3D calculation could be quantitatively diﬀerent but the structure of the spectrum would
be the same. We use the potential [3]

V (ρ, ϕ) =

−

(ρ

where r0 is the radius of the molecule (r0 = 2.6), and ρ and ϕ are polar coordinates. β is the parameter which gives
the “degree of smoothness” of the potential and determines the width of the ground state along the ring. α moves
the local maxima of the potential keeping the minima constant (the parameter α is introduced in order to avoid the
presence of points where V = 0 for ﬁnite ρ, because that could generate non-physical ionization). Finally, A is the
“strength” of the potential. For our simulations we chose α = 1.075 and β = 0.3. We used A for tuning the ionization
energy of the molecule. For more details about the model and its properties see [3].
When the correct ionization energy for the benzene molecule is taken, the four states are relatively weakly bound and
hence, as it has been already discussed in [3], for inducing a multiphoton process with a low ionization rate a low
frequency is required. As the main aim of the numerical simulations presented in this work is to test ab initio the
analytical derivations discussed in the previous sections, we chose A = 1.0 which is less demanding for what concerns
the run-time because a higher frequency can be used [3].
If with ˜R we indicate the ﬁeld-free energy of the level corresponding to the R representation of the
D6 group we have
that with A = 1.0 the energies of the four states are: ˜A1 =
1.027,
and the energy gaps between the excited states and the ground state are Ω1 = 0.0658, Ω2 = 0.1937 and Ω3 = 0.2648.
In order to have a convenient way of referencing we introduce the notation Lij

1.098 and ˜B1 =

the state Ri and Rj and its corresponding line in the spectrum. L is the ℓ which gives the transition symmetry. The
lower index distinguishes between the two signs in equation (18). The upper indices specify the initial and the ﬁnal
state, respectively. The order of the states in the upper index gives information about the sign of the line shift due
to the distance between the states. Most of the non-single-state transitions discussed here connect an excited state
with the ground state. Transitions between excited states are possible but much less likely to occur. The position of
the lines due to a “transition” from the ground to an excited state is L0i
1, and for the opposite
process Li0
When the laser is switched on the states move because of the dynamical Stark eﬀect and therefore ∆i is given by
∆i = Ωi + δi, where Ωi is the separation between the two states when no ﬁeld is present and δi is the relative shift
due to the presence of the oscillating ﬁeld.
At this point, as we know the selection rules and the values of the ﬁeld-free energy intervals Ωi, we can predict the
structure of a spectrum where also non-single state processes are involved. The only uncertainty is due to the values
of the ﬁeld shifts δi. However, those shifts can be determined by performing several simulations with diﬀerent laser
Ωi) and the lines are located in the
intensities: when the ﬁeld is low δi is small (in the limit of zero ﬁeld ∆i −→
proximity of the position expected from the unperturbed level scheme. With increasing ﬁeld the shift of the states can
be followed. They can become relatively large but the interpretation of the spectrum remains always unambiguous.
An example of a spectrum, where also lines occurring from processes between diﬀerent states are present, is shown
in Fig. 1. There, a sine-square pulse of 40 cycles and frequency ω = 0.0942 interacting with the model molecule
has been simulated. The peak ﬁeld strength ˆ
was 0.14. It is possible to ﬁgure out for each peak the transition
E
which generates it. The same symbol indicates the same process but with diﬀerent multiplier k, i.e., diﬀerent number
of photons. A certain process is repeated every N = 6 frequency units. The states that together with the ground
state play a role are the ﬁrst and the second excited, i.e., E1, and E2. The ﬁrst state generates transitions of type
1, the second state of type 2. With the parameters used for the simulation of Fig. 1 the role of the second state is
more important than that one of the ﬁrst excited state. This is mainly related to how strong the resonance with a
particular state is. With a diﬀerent frequency the relative intensity of the lines connected to the two processes can
diﬀer strongly. From the fact that the degeneracies of the states E1 and E2 are removed one could expect more lines
than present in Fig. 1. Let us discuss for example about the states E2, that in our case are the most important role
players. In theory each of the states E2 for a given k generates two lines given by 202
1 and two
given by 220
2 to distinguish the
two states E2, we ﬁnd the shifts ∆a
2 = Ωb
2 it follows that if the
diﬀerence of the shifts δi due to the laser ﬁeld is very small the eight lines are gathered in four couples, each of them
containing two very close lines, diﬃcult to resolve. Moreover, what makes the distinction between the two lines in a
couple possible is not the absolute value of δi but the diﬀerence between the two shifts. As the two states without
ﬁeld are degenerate, this diﬀerence is the splitting generated by the ﬁeld. With our notation we have for the ﬁrst
couple of lines, e.g., 202(b)
δb
2. The same applies for the other three couples. This explains why in Fig.
− −
1 only four lines due to the states E2 are observed.
In order to obtain a larger splitting, more easily detectable, we have to study how the shift δi behaves with respect to
the diﬀerent ﬁeld parameters. It was found that with lower frequencies the separation among the states that without
ﬁeld would be degenerate becomes more signiﬁcant, as one would expect from a ponderomotive scaling. Moreover, it
has been observed that the value of each δi can become relatively large compared to Ωi. In Fig. 2 we show how the
location of certain lines moves when the ﬁeld is increased.
The dipole spectrum obtained with the lower frequency ω = 0.0785 (all other parameters the same as before) is shown
in Fig. 3. Each of the lines in Fig. 1 is splitted in two, conﬁrming the analytical derivation discussed previously.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

±

We presented a general group theoretical approach to harmonic generation by systems possessing a discrete rotational
symmetry
CN , in particular a ring-shaped molecule in a circularly polarized laser ﬁeld (e.g., benzene or nanotubes).
In the simple case where the initial and the ﬁnal ﬁeld-dressed electronic state are the same the known selection rule
kN
1, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . was obtained. We demonstrated that this selection rule follows from angular momentum
conservation in a straight forward manner. Since due to this selection rule less harmonics are allowed within a
ﬁxed frequency range such systems might be beneﬁcial for generating short wavelength radiation more eﬃciently, i.e.,
without wasting a vast amount of laser energy in undesired laser harmonics. However, we showed that in general other
1)ω are present as well. Those lines carry important
harmonics diﬀerent from the expected ones at the positions (kN
information about the laser ﬁeld-dressed level scheme of the molecule since energy diﬀerences between diﬀerent states
are involved. Transitions between ﬁeld-dressed states occur because the laser pulse has a temporal shape instead of

±

7

being inﬁnite as assumed in the derivation of the kN
1-selection rule. For the case of the ring-shaped molecule
we showed that our group theoretical method is capable to predict also the position of those extra lines. This was
demonstrated with the help of harmonic spectra obtained by an ab initio numerical simulation of a benzene model
molecule interacting with a ﬁnite laser pulse. The extra harmonics are particularly pronounced in the cases where
the laser frequency (or a multiple of it) becomes resonant with electronic transitions between ﬁeld-dressed states.
Harmonic peak splittings and shifts were fully understood in the framework of the group theory approach. From the
symmetry point of view the case of a cyclic molecule in a circularly polarized laser ﬁeld is equivalent to a single atom
in a two-color ﬁeld of opposite circular polarizations and one frequency an integer multiple of the other. Of course,
the groups representing the unperturbed systems are diﬀerent in both cases.

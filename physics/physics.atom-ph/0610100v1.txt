The kinetic energy distribution of ground state muonic hydrogen atoms µp(1S) is determined
from time-of-ﬂight spectra measured at 4, 16, and 64 hPa H2 room-temperature gas. A 0.9 keV-
component is discovered and attributed to radiationless deexcitation of long-lived µp(2S) atoms in
collisions with H2 molecules. The analysis reveals a relative population of about 1 %, and a pressure-
dependent lifetime (e.g. 30.4 +21.4
−9.7 ns at 64 hPa) of the long-lived µp(2S) population, equivalent to
a 2S-quench rate in µp(2S)+H2 collisions of 4.4 +2.1

A measurement of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen,
i.e. the energy diﬀerence of 0.2 eV between the 2P - and
2S-states of µ−p atoms [1, 2, 3], is in progress at the
Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland [4]. Vacuum
polarization shifts the 2S-levels by 0.2 eV below the 2P -
levels; ﬁne and hyperﬁne splittings of the n = 2 levels are
much smaller. The ﬁnite size eﬀect is 2 % of the Lamb
shift.

The µp Lamb shift experiment is expected to give a
precise value for the root-mean-square charge radius of
the proton [5]. Together with recent advances in H-atom
spectroscopy [6, 7], this leads to a better determination
of the Rydberg constant, and to a test of bound-state
quantum electrodynamics on a new level of precision [8].

The most important prerequisite for such an exper-
iment, the availability of suﬃciently long-lived µp(2S)
atoms, has so far not been experimentally established.
When muons are stopped in H2 gas, µp atoms are formed
at high n-levels and then deexcite predominantly to the
ground state (“muonic cascade”). A fraction ε2S of a
few percent reaches the metastable 2S state whose life-
time is, in absence of collisions, essentially given by the
muon lifetime of 2.2 µs.

In a gas, there is collisional 2S-quenching, with very
diﬀerent rates depending on the µp kinetic energy be-
ing above or below the 2S-2P threshold (≈ 0.3 eV in the
lab frame) [9]. Most µp(2S) atoms are formed at ener-
gies above this threshold [10], where collisional 2S → 2P
Stark transitions (followed by 2P → 1S radiative deex-
citation) lead to rather fast 2S-depletion. This is the
“short-lived” 2S-component with a predicted lifetime [11]
τ short
2S ∼ 100 ns/pH2[hPa]. There is, however, a competi-
tion between such Stark transitions and deceleration [9].
A fraction of the µp(2S) atoms should therefore survive
the process of slowing down below 0.3 eV, where transi-
tions to the 2P state are energetically forbidden. These
µp(2S) atoms form the “long-lived” 2S-component, with
a lifetime τ long

2S and a population εlong

2S (per µp atom).

The 2S-population ε2S is well determined from the
measured µp X-ray yields [12, 13, 14]. εlong
2S can be derived
from the measured 1S kinetic energy distributions [15] by
using calculated elastic and inelastic µp(2S) cross sec-
tions [9]. At 16 hPa, for example, ε2S = (4.40 ± 0.17) %
and εlong
2S = (1.16 ± 0.12) %. Calculations of the radiative
quenching process during collisions [16, 17, 18] predicted
values of τ long
2S ∼ 600 ns or larger for an H2 pressure of
64 hPa, but this could not be conﬁrmed experimentally
in searches for delayed n = 2→1 X-rays [12, 19, 20].

We report here on the ﬁrst measurement of a non-
radiative deexcitation mechanism for long-lived µp(2S)
atoms at gas pressures pH2= 4, 16, and 64 hPa at room
temperature [15]. It was found in the analysis of time-of-
ﬂight (TOF) spectra which were measured to determine
the µp(1S) kinetic energy distributions at low densities.
A pronounced fast component showed up, corresponding
to a surprisingly high µp(1S) kinetic energy of 0.9 keV.

The basic idea of the experiment is to form µp(1S)
atoms near the axis of a cylindrical gas target and to de-
duce their kinetic energy from the measured TOF they
need to reach the gold-coated cylinder surface. The muon

takes place, and several µAu X-rays with energies
up to 9 MeV are emitted and detected by a CsI(Tl) scin-
tillator. The cylindrical geometry gives a better kinetic
energy resolution than earlier planar geometries [21].

Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. Negative
muons with a momentum of p = 10 MeV/c from the high-
intensity πE5 channel at PSI entered a 1 m long, 20 cm
inner diameter solenoid operated at 5 T and evacuated
to 10−5 hPa.
Its fringe ﬁeld reduced the radial beam
size to a few mm in the region of full ﬁeld. About

erator. The muons were detected by a parallel-plate
avalanche counter (PPAC) with a total areal density of
300 µg/cm2. The PPAC is a double gas chamber ﬁlled
with 16 hPa isobutane, with a detection eﬃciency up to

80%, depending on the muon energy. At the exit of the
PPAC, the muons had energies between 0 and 200 keV.
They then crossed a stack of seven thin carbon foils (each
with an areal density of 5 µg/cm2 and 2 cm diameter)
where a few electrons were released. A high voltage ap-
plied to the stack (∆U = 1800 V between successive foils)
accelerated these electrons, and frictional cooling [22] en-
hanced the muon stop rate. After traversing the gas tar-
get, the electrons were detected in a microchannel plate
(MCP). An incoming muon was identiﬁed by a delayed
coincidence between the signals from PPAC and MCP.
The muon detection eﬃciency of the stack-MCP assem-
bly was ∼ 40 % for a target gas pressure of 4 hPa and
decreased to ∼ 15 % at 64 hPa. The radial beam distribu-
tion was measured to be approximately Gaussian-shaped
with spreads σx ≈ σy ≈ 1.8 mm in the 5 T ﬁeld. The
cyclotron radii of the muons were ∼ 1 mm at 5 T.

The gas target vessel was a 26 cm long Al cylinder. Its
inner cylindrical surface was coated with a 500 nm thick
evaporated gold layer. The side walls were covered with
polypropylene. Measurements were performed with two
target inner radii, R = 29 mm and 10 mm. A target with
polypropylene instead of gold was used to determine the
background. Muon transfer to carbon does not produce
X-rays within the accepted µAu X-ray energy window.

The upstream and downstream target windows were
thin Formvar foils (1 cm diameter) of 10 µg/cm2 at pH2 =
4 and 16 hPa, and 40 µg/cm2 at 64 hPa. H2 gas with
< 3 ppm impurities was continuously ﬂushed through the
target (exchange rate 2/min). Outgassing from walls and
pipes resulted in a total impurity concentration of order
10−4. The measured µp formation rate was ∼ 20 s−1.

A 20 cm long cylindrical CsI(Tl) scintillator of 9.2 cm
inner and 19 cm outer diameter was placed around the
target. It had a high probability to detect at least one of
the µAu X-rays. The CsI(Tl) crystal was surrounded on
all but the outer side by an 8 mm thick plastic scintillator
acting as anti-coincidence detector against charged par-
ticle background. The fast light component of the plastic
scintillator was distinguished from the ”slow” CsI light
component (decay time ∼ 1.5 µs) by pulse shape analysis.

For each incoming muon, the time diﬀerence between
the MCP signal and a CsI signal from a µAu X-ray was
recorded. The true µp(1S) TOF, however, starts at the
formation of a µp(1S). Time calibration measurements
were done with a few per cent of xenon admixed to the H2
target gas, because at such a low Xe concentration µXe
and µp formation times are nearly identical. The µXe X-
rays were detected in the CsI(Tl) crystal, too. Several Xe
concentrations were used and the µp(1S) formation time
distribution was obtained by extrapolating to zero Xe
concentration. A careful analysis of the µXe time spectra
separated the time distribution of direct µXe-formation
from the (delayed) transfer reaction µp +Xe → µXe
+p.
Small residual deviations not taken into account by the
Xe calibration (like the µp cascade time and discrimina-
tor threshold eﬀects) were also considered.

∗

Figure 2 shows the µAu time spectra measured at 64,
16, and 4 hPa for both target radii, and the µp for-
mation time distributions deduced from the µXe data.
The background was studied with the polypropylene tar-
get. It is dominated by bremsstrahlung from muon-decay
electrons, with an additional component (depending on
pressure) at times preceding µp formation, correlated to
muons stopping in high-Z materials near the target. All
µAu time spectra exhibit a wide distribution whose maxi-
mum corresponds to µp kinetic energies Ekin of 5...20 eV.
Such energies result from Coulomb deexcitations [23]
µpn+H2 → µpn′<n + Ekin + p + ... during the cascade, a
well known eﬀect for µp and πp atoms [9].

The data measured in the R = 29 mm target, which
is most sensitive to high kinetic energies, show an un-
expected peculiarity: The 64 hPa spectrum features an
additional pronounced peak at t ≈ 100 ns. This peak is
also visible at 16 hPa, but almost disappears at 4 hPa.
The corresponding kinetic energy is about 0.9 keV, in-
dicated in Fig. 2 as dotted line at 0.074 µs which is the
calculated TOF for 29 mm, the shortest distance from
the beam center to the Au wall.

less deexcitation of µp(n = 2) atoms in collisions with H2
molecules. The n = 2 → 1 transition energy of 1.9 keV is
shared according to momentum conservation between the
formed µp(1S) and a proton of the H2 molecule:

µp(n = 2) + H2 → µp1S(0.9 keV) + p(1 keV) + . . .

.

A detailed analysis of the measured time spectra was
performed using a set of Monte Carlo (MC) generated
TOF spectra extending over the whole expected energy
range (∼ 10−2 - 103 eV). In the MC, the target and detec-
tor geometries, axial and radial muon stop distributions,
X-ray detection eﬃciencies, and scattering of µp atoms
on H2 molecules and on the gold surface of the target
cylinder were taken into account [15]. Cross sections for
µp(1S)+H2 scattering calculated by Adamczak [24] for

very diﬀerent for the same kinetic energy distribution.

An adequate ﬁt of the data could not be obtained un-
less it was assumed that the 0.9 keV component was
emitted with a non-zero lifetime. Such an eﬀect can
only be caused by long-lived µp(2S) atoms. (Other colli-
sional processes, like muon transfer to medium-Z atoms
from gas impurities, would produce X-rays with ener-
gies below those accepted for µAu.) For the data anal-
ysis a two-step process was adopted where the µp(2S)
atoms are ﬁrst slowed down to low energies without sig-
niﬁcant quenching, and then collisionally quenched at a
constant rate λquench

was therefore convoluted with an exponential, with life-

transitions are indicated in Fig. 2. A free ﬁt gave only
small amplitudes for Coulomb deexcitation components

nally, each MC TOF spectrum was convoluted with the

similar to the well-known formation of ground state
muonic molecules in muon catalyzed fusion [28]. There
is a series of resonant states just below the µp(n = 2) + p
dissociation limit [29]; rovibrational excitations of the
electronic molecule absorb the small excess energy from
the formation of the (ppµ)+ “pseudonucleus”. A subse-
quent Auger decay to states with ≥ 16 eV binding energy
stabilizes the [(ppµ)+]∗ against back decay. Mixing of the
excited [(ppµ)+]∗ with the repulsive (ppµ)+ ground state
ﬁnally leads to µp(1S) atoms with 0.9 keV kinetic energy.
A theoretical estimate of the molecular formation
rate [30] gave ∼ 5 × 1010 s−1 at LHD, ten times smaller
than our result (Eq. (1)). The calculation neglected the
correlated motion of the three interacting atoms which
is important in low-energy µp(2S) collisions because
of its long-range polarization potential. The triatomic
molecule has a much denser vibrational-state spectrum
with more ways to exchange excitation energy, leading
to longer eﬀective lifetimes of the compound system [31]
and correspondingly higher molecular formation rates.

The populations εlong

2S resulting at 16 and 4 hPa agree
with the values of (1.16 ± 0.12) % and (1.03 ± 0.09) %,
respectively, evaluated for the µp(2S) that slow down
to below 0.3 eV [15]. This means that there is little
room for radiative 2S → 1S deexcitation processes and
explains why no delayed 1.9 keV X-rays were found in
previous experiments [12, 19, 20]. The dominance of non-
radiative 2S-decay resulting from our measurements is in
accord with recent calculations of the radiative and non-
radiative decay rates of [(ppµ)+]∗ molecules [29, 32].

In summary, we have measured that ∼ 1 % of all
muons stopped in H2 gas between 4 and 64 hPa form
long-lived µp(2S) atoms that decay non-radiatively into
µp(1S) atoms of 0.9 keV kinetic energy. For the cur-
rent µp Lamb shift experiment, a pressure of ∼ 1 hPa
is needed where both 2S-population (∼ 1 %) and lifetime

(τ long
−0.21 µs at 1 hPa) meet the experimental re-
quirements [4]. First measurements at a new low-energy
muon beam at PSI showed that enough µp atoms can be
formed in a small gas volume at such pressures.

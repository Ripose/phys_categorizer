(Dated: Recieved date; Accepted date)
We report the result of our ab initio calculation of the 6s2S1/2 → 5d2D3/2 parity nonconserving
electric dipole transition amplitude in 137Ba+ based on relativistic coupled-cluster theory. Consid-
ering single, double and partial triple excitations, we have achieved an accuracy of less than one
percent. If the accuracy of our calculation can be matched by the proposed parity nonconservation
experiment in Ba+ for the above transition, then the combination of the two results would provide
an independent non accelerator test of the Standard Model of particle physics.

Parity nonconservation (PNC) in atoms arising from
neutral weak currents has the potential to test the Stan-
dard Model (SM) of particle physics [1, 2]. By combining
the results of high precision measurements and calcula-
tions of atomic PNC observables, it is possible to ex-
tract the nuclear weak charge [2] and compare with its
corresponding value in the SM. A discrepancy between
these two values could reveal the possible existence of
new physics beyond the SM. The most accurate data on
7s2S1/2
atomic PNC currently comes from the 6s2S1/2 →
transition in cesium (Cs), where the claimed experimen-
tal [3] and theoretical [4] accuracies are 0.35% and 0.5%
respectively and the deviation from the SM is about 1σ
[4]. It would indeed be desirable to consider other can-
didates which could yield accurate values of the nuclear
weak charge. In this context an experiment to observe
5d2D3/2 transition in Ba+ using
PNC in the 6s2S1/2 →
the techniques of ion trapping and laser cooling proposed
by Fortson is of special importance [5, 6].

This Letter is concerned with a high precision calcu-
lation of the amplitude of the above mentioned parity
nonconserving electric dipole (E1P N C) transition in Ba+
using relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory, which is
equivalent to all order relativistic many-body perturba-
tion theory [7].
It is the ﬁrst application of this the-
ory to atomic PNC. Blundell et al had used this theory
in the linear approximation to calculate E1P N C for the
7s2S1/2 transition in Cs [8]. Dzuba et al [9]
6s2S1/2 →
and Geetha [10] have calculated this PNC amplitude for
5d2D3/2 transition in Ba+ as discussed
the 6s2S1/2 →
later.

tral weak interaction and its Hamiltonian is given by

where GF is the Fermi constant, Qw is the nuclear weak
charge which is equal to [(2Z +N )c1u +(2N +Z)c1d] with
c1u and c1d representing electron-up-quark and electron-
down-quark coupling constants respectively, ρN (r) is the
nuclear density function and γ5(= iγ0γ1γ2γ3), which is a
pseudo-scalar, is the product of the four Dirac matrices.
PNC is responsible for mixing atomic states of oppo-
site parities but with the same angular momentum. Its
strength is suﬃciently weak for it to be considered as a
ﬁrst-order perturbation. It is therefore possible to write
the n’th state atomic wavefunction as

used the above equation to determine E1P N C for the

this approach is that the summation can be performed
only over a ﬁnite set of intermediate states which limits
the accuracy of the calculation. The method we have

DF calculation and all occupied (active holes) orbitals
in the RCC calculations. We have chosen α0 as 0.00525
and β as 2.73 for all the symmetries. All orbitals are
generated on a grid using a two-parameter Fermi nuclear
distribution approximation given by

ρ =

ρ0
1 + e(r−c)/a

(0.14)

where ρ0 is the average nuclear density, ’c’ is the half-
charge radius, and ’a’ is related to the skin thickness.

Our earlier calculations of excitation energies [13], E1
transition amplitudes [14] and magnetic dipole hyper-
ﬁne constants [15] for some of the low-lying states in
Ba+ based on RCC theory suggest that it is in princi-
ple possible to perform a calculation of E1P N C for the
5d2D3/2 transition in that ion to an accu-
6s2S1/2 →
racy of better than one percent. We have recalculated
these quantities using the same method but with a larger
basis and the results are given in table I. The agree-
ment with experiment of the most important excitation
energy (6p2P1/2) for the calculation of E1P N C is less
than one percent. This is also the case for the hyper-
ﬁne constants of three of the states – 6p2P1/2, 6p2P3/2
and 5d2D3/2, while for the 6s2S1/2 state, the agreement
is a little over one percent. All the transition ampli-
tudes are within the experimental error bars. The result
of our calculation of the electric quadrupole (E2) ampli-
5d2D3/2 transition is 12.61 in
tude for the 6s2S1/2 →
a.u. It is in agreement with our earlier calculation [14]
and well within the experimental bounds [22].
In ta-
ble II, we present the values of the square root of the
product of the hyperﬁne constants. The accuracies of
these two quantities give an indication of the accuracies
of the PNC matrix elements between 6s2S1/2 and 6p2P1/2
states as well as 6p2P3/2 and 5d2D3/2 states. Both of
them are in excellent agreement with experiment, sug-
gesting that the two leading PNC matrix elements used
in the E1P N C calculation are very accurate. The contri-
butions from the diﬀerent terms in E1P N C are presented
in table III. It is clear that the largest contribution comes

transition amplitude is not as accurate as ours. Fur-
thermore, the accuracies of their PNC matrix elements
are not known as they have not performed calculations
of the hyperﬁne constants of the relevant states. The
reason for the discrepancy between our calculation and
Geetha’s is that our approach implicitly includes several
intermediate states; particularly doubly excited opposite
parity states which her sum-over-states approach omits.

The error accrued in our calculation of E1P N C can be
determined from the errors in the excitation energies, E1
transition amplitudes and hyperﬁne constants (see table
I). We have not estimated the errors in the calculated val-
ues of these quantities by comparing with measurements,
since the error bars in the E1 transition amplitudes are
rather large. Instead, we have taken the diﬀerences of our
RCC calculations with single, double and leading triple
excitations and just single and double excitations as the
errors. The error in E1P N C (0.02) has been obtained by
adding the errors for the diﬀerent quantities it depends on
in quadrature for the leading intermediate states 6p2P1/2
and 6p2P3/2 and using a scale factor to estimate the er-
rors from other intermediate states that together make a
small contribution.

The contribution of the Breit interaction to E1P N C at
the DF level is 0.1% and the nuclear structure contri-
bution is 0.3%.The latter has been determined more ac-
curately than Blundell et al. [8] using relativistic mean
ﬁeld theory.

In conclusion, we have performed a sub one percent cal-
5d2D3/2 transition
culation of E1P N C for the 6s2S1/2 →
in Ba+ using RCC. We have included single, double as
well as a leading class of triple excitations and highlighted
the importance of various many-body eﬀects. Given the
promise that the Ba+ PNC experiment holds out, it does
indeed appear that in the future the result of that exper-
iment combined with our calculation would constitute a
new and an important probe of physics beyond the SM.

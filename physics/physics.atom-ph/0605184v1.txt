Abstract

The total cross section for double ionization of lithiumlike ions by a high-energy photon is calculated in

leading order of the nonrelativistic perturbation theory. The partial contributions due to simultaneous and

sequential emissions of two electrons are taken into account. The cross section under consideration is shown
to be related to those for double photoeﬀect on the ground and excited 21,3S states of heliumlike ions. The
double-to-single ionization ratio is equal to R = 0.288/Z 2 for lithiumlike ions with moderate nuclear charge
numbers Z. However, even for the lightest three-electron targets such as Li and Be+, analytical predictions

are found to be in good agreement with the numerical calculations performed within the framework of

diﬀerent rather involved approaches.

Recent progress in developments of intense sources of the synchrotron radiation has raised

considerable interest in the theoretical and experimental investigations of the double ionization of

atoms and ions following by the absorption of a single photon. The double photoionization is a

process of fundamental importance, because it is entirely caused by the electron correlations. As

a target, it became usual to chose neutral helium or heliumlike ions, which represent the simplest

multi-electron systems. The extensive studies of the double photoeﬀect on helium atom in the

ground state allowed one to deduce detailed information about the inner-shell electron correlations

[1, 2, 3].

The growing number of theoretical calculations has been recently devoted to the double photo-

eﬀect on excited metastable 21,3S states of the helium isoelectronic sequence [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

11, 12, 13]. The problem is also of particular interest, because it is concerned with the study of

inter-shell electron correlations. However, due to lack of intense sources of the metastable helium,

there has been no experimental work on the topic. In addition, the direct measurements on heli-

umlike ions with moderate values of nuclear charge number Z

1 are hampered in this case due

to absence of long-living excited states.

Another direction of present experimental and theoretical investigations is focused on the double

and even triple photoionization of three-electron targets in the ground state [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

20, 21, 22]. At present, the lightest targets, namely, the lithium atom or the Be+ ion, are used

only. For lithium, the double-to-single ionization ratio R = σ++/σ+ has been measured for photon

energies ω < 1 keV, which is still essentially below the high-energy nonrelativistic asymptotic limit.

After reaching the maximum value of about 4.6% around ω

240 eV, the ratio R declines slowly

up to 3.9% at ω

910 eV [17].

≃

In the high-energy nonrelativistic limit, the theoretical calculations of double and triple pho-

toionizations of Li have been ﬁrst performed with the use of B-spline basis sets [19]. The asymptotic

double-to-single ionization ratio is predicted to be 3.37(3)%, which is consistent with the available

experimental data. The high-energy limits for the ratio R were also calculated within the frame-

work of the multiconﬁgurational Hartree-Fock method [20] and with the use of fully correlated

variational wave functions [21]. The value of 3.36% reported by Yan [21] is in perfect agreement

with the calculation performed by van der Hart and Greene [19], while the ratio of 1.81% predicted

by Cooper [20] is signiﬁcantly lower. In the work [21], the calculation is also extended to the ground

state of Be+ ion, which yields σ++/σ+ = 1.97%. Recently, the double and triple photoionization

of Li have been calculated for the near-threshold energy range, employing the time-dependent

close-coupling approach [22].

In contrast to the sophisticated numerical methods mentioned above, we shall present an ana-

lytical evaluation of the total cross section for double photoionization of lithiumlike ions within the

high-energy nonrelativistic limit. The cross section under investigation is also shown to be related

to those for double photoeﬀect on the ground and excited 21,3S states of heliumlike ions with the

same nuclear charge number Z. Accordingly, experiments with stable three-electron targets can

allow one to test the theoretical predictions for low-lying excited states of heliumlike ions.

The present study is performed for asymptotic photon energies ω characterized by I

ω

≪

≪

where I = m(αZ)2/2 is the binding energy of the K-shell electron, m is the electron mass, and

α is the ﬁne-structure constant (~ = 1, c = 1). The ejected electrons are considered as being

nonrelativistic. Accordingly, the Coulomb parameter is supposed to be suﬃciently small, that

is, αZ

1. Since the photon interacts with a single electron, the emission of two electrons

≪

is mediated only via the electron-electron interaction. The latter is taken into account within

the framework of perturbation theory. As a zeroth approximation, Coulomb wave functions are

employed. Although the formal parameter of the perturbation theory is 1/Z, the actual expansion

turns out to converge extremely fast for any value of the nuclear charge number Z [23]. Accordingly,

the present consideration applies to the lithium isoelectronic sequence within the range 3 6 Z . 30.

In contrast to the heliumlike targets, the double photoionization of lithiumlike ions can proceed

via three channels, namely, double ionization of both K-shell electrons, double ionization of K- and

L-shell electrons, and single ionization of one K-shell electron with excitation of the other K-shell

electron. In the latter case, the remaining ion results to be in the doubly excited state, which can

decay afterwards either due to the Auger eﬀect or due to radiative emission. For multicharged ions

with not too large values of Z, the Auger decay accompanied by electron ejection is the dominant

process. The ﬁrst two channels represent the simultaneous (direct) ionization, while the third

channel can be referred to as the sequential (indirect) ionization. In a real experiment, one usually

measures the number of ions, the charge of which has been increased by two units. Therefore, all

three channels contribute to the total cross section of double ionization of lithiumlike ions

Let us ﬁrst consider the direct photoionization. Our calculations are performed in leading or-

der of the nonrelativistic perturbation theory with respect to the electron-electron interaction. In

this approximation, one has to consider only the Feynman diagrams with one-photon exchange.

Accordingly, it is suﬃcient to take into account the interaction only between two active electrons,

which are involved in real transitions. The interaction with the third electron (spectator) is ne-

glected, since it can ﬁrst contribute only in the next-to-leading order of the perturbation theory.

Therefore, the cross section σ++

KK(Li) for double ionization of the K-shell electrons in lithiumlike
ion is equal to the cross section σ++(He) for double photoeﬀect on heliumlike ion in the ground

state. The latter can be cast into the following analytical form [24, 25]

is the total cross section for single photoionization of the K-shell electron in the Born high-energy

Now we shall consider in more details the simultaneous ejection of two electrons from diﬀerent

shells (K and L) following by the absorption of a single photon. In the high-energy nonrelativistic

limit, the double photoionization is known to proceed mainly due to the electron-electron interac-

tion in the initial state, providing the Coulomb gauge is employed [24]. Another contribution to

the amplitude of the process, which is due to the electron-electron interaction in the ﬁnal state,

turns out to be of about the factor I/ω smaller and, therefore, can be neglected. In addition, if

The main contribution to the cross section arises from the edge domains of the electron energy

spectrum, where the energy of one electron is much larger than that of the second electron, that is,

one third of the total cross section for double photoeﬀect is gained on account of the channel of

sequential ionization. The universal scaling law (47) is our third result. The highest absolute

accuracy for the universal curve can be expected for lithiumlike multicharged ions with moderate

nuclear charge numbers 10 . Z . 25, since the higher-order corrections omitted in the present

calculations are of minor importance for the total cross sections. Nevertheless, for the particular

cases of the neutral lithium and the Be+ ion, our predictions for the ratios R are equal to 3.2%

and 1.8%, respectively, which are already in good agreement with the numerical results obtained

within the framework of rather complicated methods in works [19, 21].

Concluding, we have established the universal high-energy behavior of the double-to-single

photoionization ratio for lithiumlike ions in the ground state. The partial contributions due to

the direct and indirect ionization channels are taken into account. We have also found relations

between the cross sections for double photoeﬀect on Li- and He-like ions with the same nuclear

charge number Z. These relations can be employed for experimental tests of theoretical predictions

concerning the double photoionization of low-lying excited states of He-like ions.

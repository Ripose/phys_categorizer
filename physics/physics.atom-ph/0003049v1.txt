We demonstrate an ultrastable CO2 laser trap that provides tight conﬁnement of neutral atoms with
negligible optical scattering and minimal laser noise induced heating. Using this method, fermionic
6Li atoms are stored in a 0.4 mK deep well with a 1/e trap lifetime of 300 seconds, consistent with a
background pressure of 10−11 Torr. To our knowledge, this is the longest storage time ever achieved
with an all-optical trap, comparable to the best reported magnetic traps.

Oﬀ-resonance optical traps have been explored for
many years as an attractive means of tightly conﬁn-
ing neutral atoms [1]. Far oﬀ resonance optical traps
(FORTs) employ large detunings from resonance to
achieve low optical heating rates and high density, as well
as to enable trapping of multiple atomic spin states in
nearly identical potentials [2–6]. For CO2 laser traps [7],
the extremely large detuning from resonance and the very
low optical frequency lead to optical scattering rates that
are measured in photons per atom per hour. Hence, op-
tical heating is negligible. Such traps are potentially im-
portant for development of new standards and sensors
based on spectroscopic methods, for precision measure-
ments such as determination of electric dipole moments
in atoms [8], and for fundamental studies of cold, weakly
interacting atomic or molecular vapors.

However, all-optical atom traps have suﬀered from
unexplained heating mechanisms that limit the mini-
mum attainable temperatures and the maximum storage
times in an ultrahigh vacuum [4,9,10]. Recently, we have
shown that to achieve long storage times in all-optical
traps that are not limited by optical heating rates, heat-
ing arising from laser intensity noise and beam point-
ing noise must be stringently controlled [11,12]. Prop-
erly designed CO2 lasers are powerful and extremely sta-
ble in both frequency and intensity [13,14], resulting in
laser-noise-induced heating times that are measured in
hours. Hence, in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environ-
ment, where loss and heating arising from background
gas collisions are minimized [15,16], extremely long stor-
age times should be obtainable using ultrastable CO2
laser traps.

In this Letter, we report storage of 6Li fermions in an
ultrastable CO2 laser trap. Trap 1/e lifetimes of 300 sec-
onds are obtained, consistent with a background pressure
of 10−11 Torr. This constitutes the ﬁrst experimental
proof of principle that extremely long storage times can
be achieved in all-optical traps. Since arbitrary hyperﬁne
states can be trapped, this system will enable exploration
of s-wave scattering in a weakly interacting fermi gas.

The well-depth for a focused CO2 laser trap is deter-

¯E 2/2,
mined by the induced dipole potential U = −αg
where αg is, to a good approximation, the ground state

static polarizability [7], and ¯E 2 is the time average of the

square of the laser ﬁeld. In terms of the maximum laser
intensity I for the gaussian CO2 laser beam, the ground
state well-depth U0 in Hz is

(1)

In our experiments, a laser power of P=40 W typically is
obtained in the trap region. A lens is used to focus the
trap beam to ﬁeld a 1/e radius of af = 50 µm, yielding
an intensity of I = 2P/(πa2
f ) ≃ 1.0 MW/cm2. For the
I-P(20) line with λCO2 ≃ 10.6 µm, the Rayleigh length
is z0 = πa2
f /λCO2 = 0.74 mm. Using the Li ground
state polarizability of αg = 24.3 × 10−24 cm3 [17] yields
a well depth of U0/h = −8 MHz, which is approximately
0.4 mK. For this tight trap, the 6Li radial oscillation
frequency is 4.7 kHz and the axial frequency is 0.22 kHz.
For 6Li in a CO2 laser trap, both the excited and the
ground states are attracted to the well. The excited state
static polarizability is αp = 18.9 × 10−24cm3 [17], only
20% less than that of the ground state. With a ground
state well depth of 8 MHz, the frequency of the ﬁrst res-
onance transition in the trap is shifted by only 1.6 MHz
at the center of the trap and thus does not signiﬁcantly
alter the operation of the magneto-optical trap (MOT)
from which the trap is loaded.

The optical scattering rate Rs in the CO2 laser trap
arises from Larmor scattering [7] and can be written as
Rs = σS I/(¯hck), where the Larmor scattering cross sec-
tion σS is

σS =

8π

gk4.
α2

(2)

Here, k = 2π/λCO2. Using αg = 24.3 × 10−24 cm3 yields
σS = 5.9 × 10−30cm2. At 1.0 MW/cm2, the scattering
rate for lithium is then 2.9 × 10−4/sec, corresponding to
a scattering time of ≃ 3400 sec for one photon per atom.
As a result, the recoil heating rate is negligible.
Heating can arise from laser intensity noise and beam
pointing ﬂuctuations [11,12]. For simplicity, we estimate
the noise-induced heating rates for our trap using a har-
monic oscillator approximation which is valid for atoms

1

near the bottom of the well. This provides only a rough
estimate of the expected heating rates in the gaussian
well, since the trap oscillation frequency decreases as the
energy approaches the top of the well. A detailed discus-
sion of noise-induced heating in gaussian potential wells
will be given in a future publication. In the harmonic os-
cillator approximation, intensity noise causes parametric
heating and an exponential increase in the average en-
ergy for each direction of oscillation, h ˙Ei = ΓhEi, where
the rate constant in sec−1 is

F (q) determines the number of trapped atoms com-
pared to the total number contained in the FORT volume
at the MOT density. It is a function only of the ratio of
the well depth to the MOT temperature, q ≡ U0/(kBT ):

Here ν is a trap oscillation frequency and SI (2ν) is
the power spectrum of the fractional intensity noise in
fraction2/Hz. For our CO2 laser, SI (9.4 kHz) ≤ 1.0 ×
10−13/Hz, where it is comparable to the detector noise.
This is three orders of magnitude lower than that mea-
sured for an argon ion laser [11]. The corresponding heat-
ing time for radial oscillation in our trap at ν = 4.7 kHz
is Γ−1 ≥ 4.6 × 104 sec. For the axial oscillation, ν = 220
Hz, SI (440 Hz) ≃ 1.1× 10−11/Hz and Γ−1 ≃ 2× 105 sec.
Fluctuations in the position of the trapping laser beam
cause a constant heating rate h ˙Ei = ˙Q, where

˙Q = 4π4M ν 4Sx(ν).

(4)

Here M is the atom mass and Sx is the position noise
power spectrum in cm2/Hz at the trap focus. For 6Li,
one obtains ˙Q(nK/s) = 2.8 × 10−4ν 4(Hz) Sx(µm2/Hz).
Position noise only couples directly to the radial motion
where ν ≃ 4.7 kHz. For our laser, Sx(4.7 kHz) ≤ 3.4 ×
10−10 µm2/Hz, where the upper bound is determined by
the noise ﬂoor for our detection method. This yields ˙Q ≤
46 nK/s. Hence, we expect the trap lifetime to be limited
by the background pressure of our UHV system.

The expected number of trapped atoms NT can be
estimated as follows. We take the trapping potential to
be approximately gaussian in three dimensions:

U (~x) = −U0 exp(−x2/a2 − y2/b2 − z 2/z 2
o),

(5)
where a = b = af /√2 is the intensity 1/e radius and
zo is the Rayleigh length. Here, the lorentzian depen-
dence of the trap beam intensity on the axial position z
is approximated by a gaussian dependence on z.

We assume that after a suﬃcient loading time, atoms
in the CO2 laser trap will come into thermal and dif-
fusive equilibrium with the MOT atoms that serve as a
reservoir [18]. The density of states in the gaussian trap
and the occupation number then determine the number
of trapped atoms, which takes the form

NT = n VF ORT F [U0/(kBT )].

(6)

Here the volume of the CO2 laser trap is deﬁned as
VF ORT = a2zoπ3/2. Hence, n VF ORT is the total number
of atoms contained in the volume of the FORT at the
MOT density n.

(8)
where β ≡ − ln(1 − x). The variable x = (E + U0)/U0
is the energy of the atom relative to the bottom of the
well in units of the well depth, where −U0 ≤ E ≤ 0, and
g(0) = 1. For our MOT, the typical temperature is 1 mK,
n ≃ 1011/cm3, and n VF ORT = 5 × 105 atoms. Using the
well depth of U0 = 0.4 mK in Eq. 6 shows that NT is
of the order of 6 × 104 atoms. Much higher numbers are
obtainable for a deeper well at lower temperature.
The experiments employ a custom-built, stable CO2
laser. High-voltage power supplies, rated at 10−6 frac-
tional stability at full voltage, proper electrode design,
and negligible plasma noise enable highly stable cur-
rent. Heavy mechanical construction, along with ther-
mally and acoustically shielded invar rods, reduces vi-
bration. The laser produces 56 W in an excellent TEM00
mode.

is focused through a double-sealed,
diﬀerentially-pumped, 5 cm diameter ZnSe window into
a UHV system. The vacuum is maintained at ≃ 10−11
Torr by a titanium sublimation pump. The trap is at the
focus of a 19 cm focal length ZnSe lens.

The trap is continuously loaded from a 6Li MOT
employing a standard σ± conﬁguration [19] with three
orthogonal pairs of counterpropagating, oppositely-
polarized 671 nm laser beams, each 2.5 cm in diameter
and 8 mW. Power is supplied by a Coherent 699 dye
laser that generates 700 mW. The MOT magnetic ﬁeld
gradient is 15 G/cm (7.5 G/cm) along the radial (ax-
ial) directions of the trap. The MOT is loaded from a
multicoil Zeeman slower system [20] that employs a dif-
ferentially pumped recirculating oven source [21]. Using
a calibrated photomultiplier, the MOT is estimated to
trap approximately 108 6Li atoms. The MOT volume is
found to be ≃ 1 mm3. This yields a density of 1011/cm3,
consistent with that obtained for lithium in other ex-
periments [22,23]. Using time-of-ﬂight methods, we ﬁnd
typical MOT temperatures of 1 mK.

We initially align the CO2 laser trap with the MOT by
using split-image detection of the ﬂuorescence at 671 nm
to position the focusing ZnSe lens in the axial direction.
The focal point for the trapping beam is positioned in
the center of the MOT, taking into account the diﬀer-
ence in the index of refraction of the optics at 671 nm

2

and 10.6 µm. A 671 nm laser beam is aligned on top of
the CO2 laser beam to align the transverse position of
the focal point in the MOT. Since the Rayleigh length is
short and the focus is tight, this method does not reli-
ably locate the actual focus of the CO2 beam. Hence, a
spectroscopic diagnostic based on the light shift induced
by the CO2 laser is employed for ﬁnal alignment of the
trapping beam.

While the near equality of the Li excited and ground
state polarizabilities is ideal for continuous loading from
the MOT, it makes locating the CO2 laser focus in the
MOT by light shift methods quite diﬃcult. To circum-
vent this problem, a dye laser at 610 nm is used to ex-
cite the 2p-3d transition for diagnostics. At the 10.6 µm
CO2 laser wavelength, we estimate that the 3d state has a
scalar polarizablity of approximately 700×10−24cm3 [24],
nearly 30 times that of the 2s or 2p state. In the focus
of the CO2 laser, the corresponding light shift is ≃ −300
MHz. Chopping the CO2 laser beam at 2 kHz and using
lock-in detection of ﬂuorescence at 610 nm yields a two-
peaked light shift spectrum. This two-peaked structure
arises because the lock-in yields the diﬀerence between
signals with the CO2 laser blocked and unblocked. At
the ideal focusing lens position, the amplitude and the
frequency separation of these peaks are maximized. Op-
tical alignment remains unchanged for months after this
procedure.

Measurement of the trapped atom number versus time
is accomplished by monitoring the ﬂuorescence at 671
nm induced by a pulsed, retroreﬂected probe/repumper
beam (1 mW, 2 mm diameter). The probe is double-
blinded by acousto-optic (A/O) modulators to minimize
trap loss arising from probe light leakage. The loading
sequence is as follows: First, the CO2 laser trap is contin-
uously loaded from the MOT for 10 seconds. This pro-
vides adequate time for the MOT to load from the Zee-
man slower. Then the MOT repumping beam is turned
oﬀ, so that atoms in the upper F = 3/2 hyperﬁne state
are optically pumped into the lower F = 1/2, M = ±1/2
states. After 25 µsec, the optical MOT beams are turned
oﬀ using A/O modulators, and a mechanical shutter in
front of the dye laser is closed within 1 ms to eliminate
all MOT light at 671 nm. The MOT gradient magnets
are turned oﬀ within 0.2 ms. After a predetermined time
interval between 0 and 600 sec, the probe beam is pulsed
to yield a ﬂuorescence signal proportional to the number
of trapped atoms. The detection system is calibrated
and the solid angle is estimated to determine the atom
number. Typical trapped atom numbers measured in our
initial experiments are ≃ 2.3 × 104. This corresponds to
the predictions of Eq. 6 for a well depth of 0.25 mK. Since
we expect the potential of the MOT gradient magnet to
lower the eﬀective well depth from 0.4 mK by ≃ 0.15 mK
during loading, the measured trap number is consistent
with our predictions.

Fig. 1 shows the decay of the trapped atom number
on a time scale of 0-600 seconds. Each data point is
the mean obtained from four separate measurement se-

quences through the complete decay curve. The error
bars are the standard deviation from the mean. Atoms
in the F = 1/2 state exhibit a single exponential decay
with a time constant of 297 sec, clearly demonstrating
the potential of this system for measurements on a long
time scale.

We have observed that an initial 10-15% decrease in
the signal can occur during the ﬁrst second. This may
arise from inelastic collisions between atoms in the F =
1/2 state with atoms that are not optically pumped out
of the upper F = 3/2 state. During optical pumping,
ﬂuorescence from the F=3/2 state decays in ≃ 5 µsec
to a ≃ 5% level which persists for a few milliseconds,
consistent with a residual F = 3/2 population.
The lifetime of atoms in the F = 1/2 state can be
limited by processes that cause heating or direct loss. If
we attribute the trap lifetime entirely to residual heat-
ing, the heating rate from all sources would be at most
400µK/300sec ≃ 1µK/sec, which is quite small. How-
ever, if the loss were due to heating, one would expect
a multimodal decay curve, analogous to that predicted
in Ref. [12]. Instead, we observe a single exponential de-
cay as expected for direct loss mechanisms, such as colli-
sions with background gas atoms or optical pumping by
background light at 671 nm (into the unstable F = 3/2
state). If we assume that the lifetime is background gas
limited and that Li is the dominant constituent, the mea-
sured lifetime of 297 sec is consistent with a pressure of
≃ 10−11 Torr.
The long lifetime of the F = 1/2 state is expected,
based on the prediction of a negligible s-wave elastic scat-
tering length (<< 1 Bohr) at zero magnetic ﬁeld [25].
Hence, spontaneous evaporation should not occur. We
have made a preliminary measurement of trap loss aris-
ing from inelastic collisions when the F = 3/2 state is
occupied. This is accomplished by omitting the optical
pumping step in the loading sequence described above.
The trap is found to decay with a 1/e time < 1 sec when
2.3 × 104 atoms are loaded (density ≃ 109/cm3). A de-
tailed study of elastic and inelastic collisions at low mag-
netic ﬁeld is in progress.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a 300 sec 1/e life-
time for lithium fermions in an ultrastable CO2 laser trap
with a well depth of 0.4 mK. By using an improved as-
pherical lens system, an increase in trap depth to 1 mK is
achievable. Further, Eq. 6 shows that, if the MOT tem-
perature is reduced to 0.25 mK, more than 106 atoms
can be trapped in a 1 mK deep well. Since the ground
and excited state trapping potentials are nearly identi-
cal, exploration of optical cooling schemes may be par-
ticularly fruitful in this system. Currently, we are ex-
ploring 6Li as a fundamental example of a cold, weakly-
interacting fermi gas. By trapping multiple hyperﬁne
states, it will be possible to study both elastic and inelas-
tic collisions between fermions. The combination of long
storage times and tight conﬁnement obtainable with the
CO2 laser trap, as well as the anomalously large scatter-
ing lengths for 6Li [26,27], make this system an excellent

for bosonic atoms [28].

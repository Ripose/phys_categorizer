We investigate high-harmonic generation in closed sys-
tems, using the two-level atom as a simpliﬁed model. By
means of a windowed Fourier transform of the time-dependent
dipole acceleration, we extract the main contributions to this
process within a cycle of the driving ﬁeld. We show that the
patterns obtained can be understood by establishing a par-
allel between the two-level atom and the three-step model.
In both models, high-harmonic generation is a consequence
of a three-step process, which involves either the continuum
and the ground state, or the adiabatic states of the two-level
Hamiltonian. The knowledge of this physical mechanism al-
lows us to manipulate the adiabatic states, and consequently
the harmonic spectra, by means of a bichromatic driving ﬁeld.
Furthermore, using scaling laws, we establish sharp criteria
for the invariance of the physical quantities involved. Conse-
quently, our results can be extended to a broader parameter
range, as for instance those characteristic of solid-state sys-
tems in strong ﬁelds.

I. INTRODUCTION

∼

1014W/cm

The generation of high-order harmonics of a strong
laser ﬁeld (I
) in gaseous samples, where
coherent light in the extreme ultraviolet regime is ob-
tained from infrared input radiation, originated a break-
through in nonlinear optics. In these systems, composed
by atoms or small molecules, high-harmonic generation
(HHG) is a well-understood issue [1]. These highly non-
linear spectra exhibit very particular features: a fre-
quency region with harmonics of roughly the same in-
tensities, the “plateau”, and a sharp decrease in the har-
monic yield at the plateau’s high-energy end, the “cut-
oﬀ”. Since the early nineties, not only these features
have been investigated, but also the HHG time proﬁle
[2,3], physical mechanisms [4,5], and the propagation of
the harmonic radiation in gaseous media [6]. These stud-
ies culminated with countless proposals of how to control
high harmonics, as diverse as for instance polychromatic
[7–9] or static [10] ﬁelds, ultrashort pulses [11], or ad-
ditional potentials [12], many of them having even been
realized experimentally [13].

One of the ﬁrst models proposed to describe high-
harmonic generation in atoms or diatomic molecules was
a two-level atom [4]. Within this framework, a par-
ticularly important paper is [14]. Therein, it is shown
that these harmonics are a consequence of the popula-
tion transfer between the ﬁeld-dependent states obtained
from the diagonalization of the two-level Hamiltonian.

This physical mechanism has not been investigated in de-
tail, and there is a very simple reason for this apparent
lack of interest: it turned out that an at ﬁrst sight com-
pletely diﬀerent physical picture is far more successful in
explaining high-harmonic generation for these systems.
This picture, known as “the three-step model”, portraits
high-harmonic generation as a process in which an elec-
tron leaves an atom at an instant t0 (the ﬁrst step), prop-
agates in the continuum being accelerated by the ﬁeld
(the second step), and recombines with the ground state
of its parent ion [5] at a later time t1, emitting a high-
harmonic photon (the third step). This model has shown
that the interplay between a bound state and the contin-
uum, which is not present in a two-level atom, is essential
for a correct physical description of high-harmonic gener-
ation. Thus, the three-step model has established itself as
the paradigm for describing this phenomenon (see, e.g.,
[15] for a comparison of both models).

Until very recently, only gaseous systems were believed
to be possible high-harmonic sources, due to the high in-
tensities involved. However, nowadays, this picture has
changed. With the advent of short pulses, there are solid-
state materials which can survive the necessary intensity
regime, namely 1012
1014W/cm
[16]. This has led to
theoretical studies on high-harmonic generation in ma-
terials such as thin crystals [17], or carbon nanotubes
[18]. Another example of a new and unexpected eﬀect is
for instance carrier-wave Rabi ﬂopping, which has been
recently measured experimentally [19].

Furthermore, apart from this entirely new parame-
ter range, even for considerably lower driving-ﬁeld in-
tensities, as for instance I
, one may in
principle extend the frequency of far-infrared radiation
1GHz) in up to two orders of magnitude by using
(ω
adequate materials. For instance, for GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs
wells intersubband transitions of ω0
1THz may serve
this purpose [20]. Apart from these solid-state materials,
HHG involving larger molecules is becoming a problem
of interest [21,22].

∼

For these complex systems,

it is not entirely clear
whether bound-to-continuum transitions still yield the
most adequate description of high-harmonic generation.
In fact, recent studies have shown that, for aromatic
molecules, transitions involving solely bound states are
far more important for high-harmonic generation than
the interplay between the ground state and the contin-
uum [22]. Thus, theoretical approaches in which the con-
tinuum is not taken into account may be possibly used
to describe this phenomenon in systems as, for instance,

1

quantum wells [20,23–26]. Furthermore, descriptions of
nonlinear optical processes in solids are widely based on
the Hartree-Fock semiconductor Bloch equations. Under
special conditions, such as low doping density, equal eﬀec-
tive masses in both subbands involved, parallel subbands,
and not too wide wells, these equations are formally iden-
tical to those describing the evolution of a two-level atom.
Otherwise, collective eﬀects must be taken into account
and this analogy is lost [20,24–26].

A common characteristic of all the above-stated sys-
tems is their intrincated internal structure, with the pres-
ence, as the external parameters are varied, of several
level crossings. In particular concerning HHG, the peri-
odic level crossings caused by the temporal dependence
of the laser ﬁeld are very important [14]. Thus, in order
to control the harmonic spectra also in this context, one
needs to understand the interplay between the popula-
tion transfer at these crossings and high-harmonic gen-
eration.

Even in the simplest case for which these level cross-
ings occur, namely a two-level atom, it is only clear that
most of the population transfer between the ﬁeld-dressed
states takes place at the level crossings. However, this
does not necessarily mean that the population transfers,
within a ﬁeld cycle, which contribute to the generation
of a particular group of harmonics occur at the level-
crossing times. Unanswered questions in this framework
concern not only these times, but also how they depend
on the external-ﬁeld parameters, such as its intensity and
frequency, and how one can use this information to con-
trol the emission spectra of a “closed”, non-ionizing sys-
tem. Another interesting issue concerns the existence of a
one-to-one correspondence between the three-step model
and the two-level atom. This was proposed in [14] due
to the diﬀerent time scales involved in the process, and
in [20] due to a formally identical expression describing
population transfers in both models. In these references,
however, there is no proof that this correspondence really
holds.

The answer to these questions is the main objective
of this work. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec.
II we brieﬂy discuss the theoretical background for the
studies performed in this paper. In the following sections
we present our results. In Sec. III, we concentrate on a
detailed analysis of the population transfers and the time
proﬁle of harmonic generation for a monochromatic ﬁeld.
Subsequently (Sec. IV), we provide concrete examples of
how an additional driving ﬁeld may alter the periodic
level crossings, and consequently the harmonic emission
of a closed system. Furthermore, we address the scal-
ing behavior of the physical quantities involved (Sec. V),
establishing sharp criteria for their invariance. Finally,
in Sec. VI we close the paper with some concluding re-
marks.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Two-level atom

The simplest case for which level crossings occur, and
a widely used approximation for describing physical sys-
tems, is a two-level atom [27]. Within this picture, the
time-dependent wave function is given by

where H is the Hamiltonian matrix, which, in our case,
describes an atom in an external laser ﬁeld. We use
atomic units throughout. The basis states
are cho-
sen according to the problem at hand. We are par-
ticularly interested in a basis which yields sharp, well-
separated level crossings in the strong-ﬁeld regime.

A widely used basis are the ﬁeld-free-states, also known
as the “diabatic basis”. In this case, the Hamiltonian is
given by

basis is very convenient for studying level crossings in the
(cid:12)
low-intensity laser ﬁeld regime. For strong laser ﬁelds,
(cid:12)
however, the ﬁeld-free states are too strongly mixed, such
that a more appropriate basis is needed. Such a basis,
which will be called by us “exchanged basis”, is obtained
applying the unitary transformation

onto the diabatic basis. The transformation (4) was
used in [14] to interchange the diagonal and the non-
diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian (3). In this case, the
exchanged-basis energies εE
x10E(t) cross, and the
± =
coupling which causes the crossing is eﬀectively given
by ω10/2. The crossings occur within a time interval
t0
tc < t < t0 + tc, where tc is the time for which
the oﬀ-diagonal and diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian
become equal and t0 is the time for which the ﬁeld van-
ishes. For strong enough ﬁelds, the times over which the
crossings take place are much smaller than the period of
the driving ﬁeld. Thus, to ﬁrst approximation, one may

assume that the crossings take place instantaneously at
t0. In the following we call t0 “crossing times”.

Another important set of basis states are these which
diagonalize H. This basis is the so-called “adiabatic ba-
sis”, in the sense that the states “follow” the ﬁeld, and
is obtained by means of the unitary transformation

adiabatic state. The equations above are the superposi-
tion of two distinct terms, namely the crossed terms and
the population diﬀerence between the adiabatic states.
Since the population diﬀerence h(t) roughly “follows” the
ﬁeld, it contributes mainly to the generation of low har-
monics, whereas g(t) is expected to be responsible for the
high harmonics. This has been conﬁrmed by numerical
studies (not shown).

→ ∞

An interesting feature is that, in the extreme limit
E0
, the transformation (5) formally corresponds
to (4) and the dipole length (10) becomes proportional
to the population diﬀerence between the adiabatic states.
However, one should keep in mind that, only in this limit,
the states obtained using (4) on the ﬁeld-free states and
the adiabatic states are formally equivalent. In general,
this is not the case.

In the subsequent sections, we work mainly in the adia-
batic basis, and refer to crossings of the exchanged-basis
energies. For the adiabatic energies, there are avoided
crossings. The results discussed in this paper have been
obtained from the numerical solution of Eq. (2) in the
adiabatic basis, by means of a fourth-order Runge-Kutta
method. Unless stated otherwise, the driving ﬁeld is
turned on instantaneously.

B. Windowed Fourier transform

For both open and closed systems, high-harmonic gen-
eration is always related to abrupt population transfers.
Depending on the group of harmonics, they occur at
particular times, which give the main contributions to
high-harmonic generation within a ﬁeld cycle. For an
atom in a strong laser ﬁeld, for instance, these times are
well-known and correspond to the return times t1 of an
electron which left an atom at a previous time t0. For
a closed system, the times t0 correspond to the level-
crossing times and the times t1 are still an open question
to some extent. A very useful method to extract these
latter times from the time-dependent dipole is performing
a Fourier transform with a temporally restricted window
function. For an arbitrary function f (t′), this transform
is

(t, Ω, σ) =

F

dt′f (t′)W (t, t′, Ω, σ)

,

(12)

where t, Ω and σ denote the time and harmonic frequency
at which the window function is centered, and its tempo-
ral width, respectively. We consider a Gabor transform,
for which the window function is given by

III. GENERAL PICTURE

We shall now investigate the connection between HHG
and the periodic level crossings in detail and draw a gen-
eral physical picture of the mechanisms involved. The
simplest physical situation for which one can do this is a
monochromatic ﬁeld

E(t) = E0 sin(ωt),

(14)

3

where E0 and ω denote the ﬁeld strength and frequency,
respectively.
In this case, the time tc is given by the
condition

ωtc =

ω10
2x10E0

.

(15)

1,
If the ﬁeld amplitude E0 is large enough, then ωtc ≪
and the avoided crossings of the adiabatic states are well-
separated. Thus, the crossing times t0 are well-deﬁned
and there is eﬃcient population transfers at t0. Hence,
one expects the corresponding spectrum to exhibit a wide
plateau and a sharp cutoﬀ.

φA

n (t)

The avoided crossings occur at the times t0 = nπ/ω
for which the ﬁeld is vanishing. Thus, one expects the
population transfers between the states
to occur
at these times. This is partially conﬁrmed by Fig. 1,
where the populations of the adiabatic states are plotted
as functions of time. In fact, the pronounced peaks at
the times t0 clearly show that most population transfer
takes place at these times. There are however several
smaller peaks, which are symmetric with respect to the
times t1M = (2n + 1)π/2ω for which the ﬁeld is maximal.
These peaks show that population transfer also occurs at
other times, and can be seen in detail in Fig. 1(b).

external ﬁeld parameters ω = 0.05a.u., E0 = 0.6 a.u., and
dipole-matrix element x10 = 1.066 a.u.. Part (a) shows this
feature for several cycles of the driving ﬁeld, whereas part
(b) depicts the population of the excited adiabatic state only
within half a cycle. The times are given in units of the ﬁeld
cycle T = 2π/ω. The driving ﬁeld is turned on linearly within
two periods.

4

The role of these population transfers in HHG can be
understood using the Gabor transform of the dipole ac-
celeration. The peaks in the Gabor spectra give the main
contributions for high-harmonic generation within a ﬁeld
cycle. For the cutoﬀ harmonic, there is a single peak
at t1M which splits into two, for the plateau harmonics.
This peak gets further apart as the harmonic frequency
decreases, varying from t1M to the times at the imme-
diate vicinity of the avoided crossings. These results are
displayed in Fig. 2.

as functions of time, for ﬁeld strength E0 = 1 a.u., ﬁeld fre-
quency ω = 0.05 a.u., transition frequency ω10 = 0.409 a.u.
and dipole matrix element x10 = 1.066 a.u.. The cutoﬀ har-
monic lies at ΩM = 43ω. The time width of the window func-
tion was chosen σ = 0.1T . Its center was chosen at the cut-
oﬀ harmonics, as well as at harmonic energies which roughly
correspond to Ω = 0.8ΩM , Ω = 0.6ΩM , and Ω = 0.4ΩM . All
time-resolved spectra have been normalized. The times are
given in units of the ﬁeld cycle T = 2π/ω. The driving ﬁeld
is turned on linearly within two periods.

The physical interpretation of these features is rather
simple. At the times the level crossings occur, i.e., at t0 =
nT /2, there is a population transfer from the adiabatic

with γ1 = ω/(2x10E0) and γ2 = ω10/(2x10E0). The
physical signiﬁcance of γ1 and γ2 will be discussed later
in this paper (Sec. V).
In order to obtain a har-
monic at the maximum possible frequency ΩM (i.e.,
the cutoﬀ harmonic), the population transfer between
the time-dependent states must occur at the times for
which the energy diﬀerence εA
εA
− is maximal, i.e., at
t1M = (2n + 1)π/2ω. As the harmonic energy decreases,
there are two possible times for this population transfer
to occur, a shorter and a longer one. The interference
between these two possible quantum paths originates the

+ −

ﬁeld strength E0, the ﬁeld frequency ω and on the dipole
matrix element x10 in a non-trivial way. These structures
seem not to inﬂuence the harmonics gobally, but mainly
the substructure of the spectra and the hyper-Raman
lines [29].

In Fig. 4, we show these enveloping functions for the
populations of the adiabatic states (Fig. 4(a)), the dipole
acceleration (Fig. 4(b)), and the Gabor spectra of the
plateau and cutoﬀ harmonics (Fig. 4(c)). One should
note that this enveloping function is the same for the
Gabor transforms of all groups of harmonics displayed.
Furthermore, it does not aﬀect the splitting of the peaks,
such that the population transfer times are always given
by Eq. (16).

two-level atom plateau. This process repeats itself every
half cycle of the driving ﬁeld. This picture is supported
by the fact that all peaks in the time-resolved spectra
satisfy Equation (16) and thus can be traced back to
population transfers between the adiabatic states. The
times given by (16) for the parameters of Fig. 2, together
with the corresponding harmonic energies, are written in
Table I.

An analogous picture is observed within the three-step
model framework. The cutoﬀ harmonic can only be gen-
erated by an electron which returns to its parent ion
with maximal kinetic energy. This maximal energy cor-
responds to a particular return time, which appears as
a single peak in the Gabor yield. Within the plateau,
there are two possible sets of electron trajectories cor-
responding to the same harmonic energy, such that this
single peak splits into two [3]. In our case, the “ﬁrst step”
would be the population transfer from
1 (t)
at t0, the “second step” would be the system following

spond to the generation of the cutoﬀ and plateau harmonics,
respectively. The main physical processes are indicated by
arrows in the ﬁgure, and the corresponding energies can be
read in the vertical axis. The adiabatic energies are given in
units of the maximal energy εA
M and the time in units of the
ﬁeld cycle. The ﬁeld parameters are chosen in such a way
A
that the ratio between the cutoﬀ energy ΩM = 2ε
M and the
transition frequency is ΩM /ω10 = 10.

Another interesting feature is that the population
transfers between the adiabatic states are not strictly pe-
riodic within π/ω. Indeed, superposed to them, there are
oscillations which occur within much larger time scales,
their periods comprising several cycles of the driving ﬁeld
[30]. These oscillations are also present in the dipole
length and acceleration as a gobal enveloping function,
whose amplitude, form and periodicity depend on the

acceleration ¨x(t); (c) the Gabor spectra of the cutoﬀ and
plateau harmonics. The time width of the window func-
tion is σ = 0.1T . The ﬁeld strength, the ﬁeld frequency,
the transition frequency and the dipole matrix element were
chosen as E0 = 0.6 a.u., ω = 0.05 a.u., ω10 = 0.409
a.u. and x10 = 1.066 a.u., respectively. These parameters
give γ1 = 0.0391, γ2 = 0.3197 and a cutoﬀ frequency at
Ωmax = 27ω. All Gabor spectra have been normalized to
the maximum value obtained with the window function cen-
tered at the cutoﬀ. The ﬁeld is turned on linearly within two
periods. The time is given in units of the ﬁeld cycle.

IV. CONTROL

In this section, we consider a bichromatic driving ﬁeld

E(t) = E01 sin(ωt) + E02 sin(nωt + θ),

(17)

with two main purposes. First, we wish to conﬁrm the
physical picture in which the main contributions to a
particular set of harmonics, within a ﬁeld cycle, occur at
the times t1 such that the corresponding harmonic fre-
εA
quency is the diﬀerence εA
− between the energies of
+ −
the adiabatic states. Second, we are interested in under-
standing how an additional ﬁeld can be used to distort
the avoided crossings between the adiabatic states in such
a way that the harmonic emission can be controlled. In
the bichromatic case, depending on the ﬁeld parameters,
the spectra may have several cutoﬀs, which are given by
the maxima of εA
εA
−. Consequently, the main contribu-
tions to the generation of the cutoﬀ harmonics take place
at the times t1M for which these maxima occur.

Equation (18) gives the extrema which coincide with
those of the ﬁeld, and therefore t1M , whereas Equation

ings, and therefore t0. Depending on the frequency ratio
n, the ﬁeld-strength ratio ζ and the relative phase θ, these
times, as well as the corresponding extrema, can be very
diﬀerent. In this paper, we will provide concrete exam-
ples for a ω

θ1 = 0 and θ2 = π/2, and arbitrary ζ. For these spe-
ciﬁc parameters, (18) and (19) have a simple form, with
analytical solutions.

The solutions corresponding to the positive root exist for
all ﬁeld-strength ratios, whereas the remaining solutions

are only present for ζ > 0.5. Further in this section, it
will be shown that the ﬁrst set gives the absolute maxima
of εA
±, which correspond to the cutoﬀ in the harmonic
spectra, whereas the second set yields local maxima at
much lower energies.

The expression giving the avoided crossings, on its

turn, can be written as

sin(ωt) [1 + 2ζ cos(ωt)] = 0.

This equation yields the crossing times t0 = nπ/ω, and
t′
1/(2ζ)]. The crossing times t0 do not

depend on the ﬁeld-strength ratio and are the same as
in the monochromatic case, whereas the crossing times

ﬁeld E(t) = E01 sin(ωt) + E02 sin(2ωt + θ), for θ = 0 and sev-
eral ﬁeld-strength ratios ζ = E02/E01. The time t is given in
units of the ﬁeld cycle T = 2π/ω and the ﬁeld-dressed ener-
A

gies in units of the maximal energy ε
were chosen such that ΩM /ω10 = 8.

Fig. 5 gives concrete examples of how the adiabatic
energies εA
± depend on time, for diﬀerent ﬁeld-strength
ratios. In contrast to the monochromatic case, εA
± is not
periodic within half a cycle of the driving ﬁeld. This is
not surprising, since the periodicity of the ﬁeld-dressed
energies is eﬀectively determined by E2(t) (c.f. Eq. (7)).
For a monochromatic ﬁeld, E2(t) = E2(t + π/ω) always
holds, whereas in the bichromatic case this is only true
for odd frequency ratios n. This is clearly not the case
addressed in this paper. For the phase φ = 0, one ob-
serves that εA

symmetrically with respect to t0 = nπ/ω. This property
already reﬂects itself in the expressions for t0, t1M and

Furthermore, one clearly sees that, as predicted in Eq.
(22), for ζ < 0.5, the second driving wave only distorts
the avoided crossings, making them broader at t0 = (2n+
1)π/ω and sharper at t0 = 2nπ/ω. For ζ = 0.5, the broad
crossing starts to split, originating the crossings given at
the times t′
0. This splitting also leads to the second set
of maxima predicted by Eq. (21), which corresponds to
a set of harmonics of relatively low frequencies.

One must now understand which consequences this ef-
fect has on the physical quantities involved. With that
purpose, we choose the strengths of both driving waves
such that εA
M , and therefore the cutoﬀ energy, remains
unchanged and is equal to the monochromatic cutoﬀ en-
ergy, for variable ﬁeld-strength ratio ζ. This gives

oscillations of the dipole acceleration get “squeezed” be-
tween the broader nodes. This feature can be seen in Fig.
6(b).

tions of time,

ζ = E02/E01. The maximal ﬁeld strength is kept ﬁxed ac-
cording to Eq. (23), with E0 = 1 a.u. The cutoﬀ energy lies

at ΩM = 2ε
M = 43ω. The temporal width of the window
function is σ = 0.1T .
In Part (a), the window function is
centered at the cutoﬀ harmonics, and the ﬁeld-strength ratio
is 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 0.8. In Part (b), the center of the window function
is taken for diﬀerent frequencies, and ζ = 0.8. All curves in
the ﬁgure have been normalized to their maximum values.

The Gabor transform of the dipole acceleration, taken
at the cutoﬀ and in the plateau, conﬁrms this picture. In
Fig. 7(a), there is a clear displacement of the peaks in
the time-resolved spectra for the cutoﬀ harmonics, with
respect to the monochromatic case, and these peaks oc-
cur at the times predicted by Eq. (21). Similarly to the
monochromatic case, these peaks split into two in the
plateau region, being, however, slightly asymmetric (Fig.
7(b)). This asymmetry is related to the above-mentioned
diﬀerence in the shapes of the crossings. Furthermore, for
larger ﬁeld-strength ratio, the additional times can also
be seen, for a group of harmonics at the low-energy end
of the plateau. The times t0 and t1M , together with the
respective cutoﬀ energies, are given in Table II for the
speciﬁc parameters considered in this ﬁgure.

The population transfers between the adiabatic states,
as functions of time, also exhibit very similar asymme-
tries to the ones observed in the ﬁeld-dressed energies.
The population transfers at the broad crossings, for in-
stance, take place at longer time intervals than those at

the sharp crossings, making the oscillations in

asymmetric with respect to the times t1M . This asymme-
try increases with increasing ζ. An example is provided
in Fig. 6(a). A similar feature occurs for the dipole accel-
eration. This highly oscillating function exhibits nodes
at the level-crossing times. In the monochromatic case,
these nodes extend over identical temporal regions ev-
ery half-cycle of the driving ﬁeld. For bichromatic ﬁelds,
however, with the distortion of the crossings by the sec-
ond driving wave, this picture changes. There exist nar-
rower and broader nodal regions, corresponding to the

tio and yield the same maxima as in the monochromatic
case, and t′
1M = 1/ω arcsin[1/(4ζ)], which clearly depend
on ζ and exist only for ζ

to the case θ = 0, one may shift all level-crossing times
by changing the relative intensities of the driving waves.
The set of crossings given by the positive root in (26)
exists only for ζ
1, whereas the remaining crossings
occur for all ζ.

≥

In Fig. 8, we depict the adiabatic states as functions
of time, for several values of ζ, similarly to what was
done for θ = 0. This ﬁgure illustrates how the relative
phase can radically alter the whole physical picture. For
θ = π/2, already a relatively weak high-frequency wave
considerably distorts the avoided level crossings, as well
as the maxima of the ﬁeld-dressed energies. An interest-
ing feature is that the avoided crossings now move with
the ﬁeld-strength ratio. Furthermore, the maximal ener-
gies are no longer equal, but, within a ﬁeld cycle, there
are two comparable and diﬀerent cutoﬀ energies. This
can be directly seen by computing the extrema of the
energies εA

±, which occur for t1M .

For ﬁeld-strength ratio ζ < 0.25, they give the energies

which correspond to the times t1M1 = 0.25T mod T, and
to t1M2 = 0.75T mod T, respectively. These times deﬁne
symmetry axes for the time-dependence of the adiabatic
energies.
For ζ

0.25, a further splitting of the set of maxima
at t1M1 occurs, as predicted in Eq. (24). There exist now
two sets of maxima, at the times t′

These maxima are symmetric with respect to t1M1 . For
these times, the adiabatic energies now exhibit a mini-
mum. This causes, for large ζ, additional avoided cross-
ings (c.f. Fig. 8 for ζ = 0.8). The population transfers
at these times are however small, and play only a sec-
ondary role in the problem addressed in this paper. For
the sake of simplicity, even after the second splitting, we
shall refer to the lower-energy set of maxima as εA
M1. The
other set of maxima does not split, and the correspond-
ing times t1M2 remain constant for all ζ. One should note
that the adiabatic energies, in the θ = π/2 case, satisfy

rically with respect to t1M1 or t1M2 . This also holds for

in units of the ﬁeld cycle and the ﬁeld-dressed energies in
units of the maximal energy εA
M2 . The ﬁeld parameters were
chosen such that ΩM2 /ω10 = 8. The times t1Mi are indicated
in the ﬁgure by the dotted and solid grid lines, respectively.

In order to investigate how the distortions in the
adiabatic-state energies inﬂuence the physical quantities
of interest, we shall keep the cutoﬀ energy ΩM2 = 2εA

ﬁxed, and equal to the cutoﬀ energy of the monochro-
matic case. Thus, the ﬁeld strengths E01 and E0 are
related by

As in the previous section, we can trace all distortions
observed in these physical quantities back to those ob-
served in time dependence of εA
±. For instance, the shifts
in the level-crossing times t0 predicted by Eq. (26) are
also present in the main population-transfer times for
the adiabatic states (Fig. 9(a)) and in the nodes of the
dipole acceleration (Fig. 9(b)). Another eﬀect which is
clearly seen in both quantities is the splitting of the max-
ima near t1M1 = 0.25T mod T. Indeed, there exist now

are now present. Other sets of peaks which can be seen
in the picture correspond to the upper-plateau return
times, which occur for Ω < ΩM2 and are symmetric with
respect to t1M2 = 0.75T mod T. These peaks come from
the splitting of t1M2 , which occurs in this energy range
(c.f. Fig. 8). The population-transfer times for the spe-
ciﬁc parameters of this ﬁgure, together with the corre-
sponding harmonic frequencies, are given in Table III.

is given in units of the ﬁeld cycle.

We now investigate the Gabor transform of the cutoﬀ
and plateau harmonics.
In Fig. 10(a), we display the
time-resolved spectra, centered at the harmonic frequen-
cies ΩM2 = 2εA
M2, for diﬀerent ﬁeld-strength ratios ζ. The
monochromatic case is also displayed for comparison. As
a general feature, for ζ
= 0, the peaks of the Gabor spec-
tra at t1M1 = 0.25T mod T vanish. This is a direct con-
sequence of the splitting of the extrema of the adiabatic
energies caused by the high-frequency wave. Due to this
splitting, the energy maxima near t1M1 lie outside the
range of the window function and do not contribute to
the time-resolved spectra. Furthermore, as predicted in
Eq. (25), the peaks at the maxima t1M2 = 0.75T mod T
do not move in time as ζ is varied.

Taking now the window function (13) centered at
ΩM1 = 2εA
M1 (Fig. 10(b)), one observes, as expected, a
completely diﬀerent behavior for the peaks near t1M1 =
0.25T mod T. For ζ < 0.25, these peaks are exactly at
these times. For ζ
0.25, as expected, they now occur
at t′
1M = 1/ω arcsin[1/(4ζ)], which vary with the ﬁeld-
strength ratio ζ. Furthermore, this second set of peaks
splits for these larger ﬁeld-strength ratios, such that two

C. Fourier spectra for the two phases

In the investigations performed so far, our main objec-
tive was to understand how an additional driving wave
may distort the time dependence of the adiabatic en-
ergies and the time proﬁle of harmonic generation.
In
this section, we address the question of how these distor-
tions inﬂuence the harmonic spectra. Furthermore, we
are interested in extending the cutoﬀ, and, by doing so,
guaranteeing that the harmonics in this energy region

6
are strong enough for applicational purposes. Clearly,
the ideal scenario is to extend the cutoﬀ energy without
any intensity loss in the corresponding harmonic range.
With that purpose, we keep E01 and E02 ﬁxed and
compare spectra obtained for θ1 = 0 and θ2 = π/2. These
results are displayed in Fig. 11. As a global feature, one
observes that, for θ = 0, all harmonics behave in a very
similar way, with no distinct regions, as for instance a
double plateau, in the spectra. This is related to the
fact that no splitting of the cutoﬀ energy occurs in this
case. The two maxima in εA
± have the same energy, even
though the level-crossing pattern is no longer periodic
in T /2. On the other hand, for θ = π/2, there is a
clear double-plateau structure. In fact, one can identify a
completely diﬀerent physical behavior for the harmonics
in the frequency regions Ω < ΩM1 and ΩM1 < Ω < ΩM2 .
The double-plateau structure is due to the diﬀerent cutoﬀ
energies which exist in the θ = π/2 case.

Another generic feature is that the cutoﬀ energy is ex-
tended for θ = π/2. This is expected, since this quantity
is given by the maximum energy diﬀerence between the
adiabatic states. For a ﬁeld given by Eq. (17), the maxi-
mal possible energy is obtained for E(t1M2 ) = E01 + E02.
This yields the harmonic frequency ΩM2 , discussed in the
previous subsection.

There exist however non-generic features, which de-
pend on the absolute ﬁeld parameters, as for instance its
strength. Examples of such features are the intensity ra-
tio between the upper and lower parts of the plateau for
θ = π/2, and the intensities of the harmonics obtained
for θ = π/2, compared to those obtained for θ = 0. Thus,
depending on the absolute parameters used, it is not al-
ways possible to extend the cutoﬀ energy without loss of
intensity. In order to control HHG in a two-level atom,
a more detailed study of these features for the particular
system in question is necessary.

FIG. 11. Spectra computed from the dipole acceleration,
for the bichromatic ﬁeld E(t) = E01 sin(ωt)+E02 sin(2ωt+θ),
for θ = 0, θ = π/2, and ﬁeld strenghts E01 = 1.0 a.u. and
E02 = 0.2 a.u. The ﬁeld is switched on linearly within two cy-
cles. The remaining parameters are ω = 0.05 a.u., ω10 = 0.409
a.u., x10 = 1.066. The cutoﬀ frequency for θ = 0 is roughly
at ΩM = 46ω, whereas for θ = π/2 the cutoﬀ frequencies are
approximately at ΩM1 = 35ω and ΩM2 = 52ω. All cutoﬀ
energies are indicated by arrows in the ﬁgure.

These non-generic features are mainly due to the fact
that the population transfer at the level crossings is, in
general, given by more complicated expressions than in
the monochromatic case. Indeed, these expressions de-
pend on the shape and width of the crossing, and on
the duration of the interaction. These shapes have been
studied in [28,32]. Furthermore, the global structures of
2 have a stronger

inﬂuence on the spectra in the bichromatic case than for
monochromatic driving ﬁelds.

V. SCALING BEHAVIOR

In the results discussed in the previous sections, we
have used rather unrealistic frequencies and intensities
for the driving ﬁelds, for which most physical systems
would ionize immediately. This choice of parameters al-
lows us to obtain results with very little numerical eﬀort.
In order to extend our computations to more realistic
cases, as for instance solids, there are two possibilities.
Either one slightly increases the eﬀort to obtain the nec-
essary precision, or one must ﬁnd speciﬁc combinations
of parameters for which the physical quantities involved
remain invariant. This second approach has the advan-
tage to provide additional insight into the physics of the
problem.

With that purpose, we analyze the scaling behavior
of these quantities. We use scaling laws which have
been derived elsewhere [34], in the context of stabiliza-
tion of atoms in strong laser ﬁelds. We concentrate on
the question of whether driving ﬁelds of much lower fre-
quencies and intensities could originate similar spectra,
with, for instance, the same number of harmonics, or the
same population-transfer times, in units of the ﬁeld cycle.
Therefore, our starting point will be the expression

sin(ωt1) + ζ sin(nωt1 + θ) =

2

(N γ1)

2
(γ2)

(31)

−

±

q

which relates the harmonic energy to the energy diﬀer-
ence of the adiabatic states. This equation gives the
population-transfer times. For ζ = 0, one has the
monochromatic-ﬁeld case (Eq.
= 0
and n = 2, the bichromatic situation discussed in the
previous section. Note that the parameters E0, ω, ω10
and x10 appear combined, as γ1 = ω/(2x10E0), or γ2 =
ω10/(2x10E0). The denominators of these expressions
give the Rabi frequencies ΩR = 2x10E0, which scale like

(16)), and, for ζ

10

the energies (c.f. Eqs. (3) and (6) for the two-level Hamil-
tonian). This keeps the Schr¨odinger Equation invariant
under scale transformations.

We now consider the scale transformation

10 = λω10; ΩR →

ω′ = λω; ω10

→

→

ω

R = λΩR,

(32)

where λ denotes the dilatation factor. The invariance
of the Schr¨odinger equation also requires that the time
t′ = λ−1t, such that Eq. (31) will remain
scales as t
invariant.

→

This apparently trivial result has far-reaching conse-
quences. In fact, it shows that, for any set E0, ω, ω10 and
x10, the number of harmonics N in the spectra and the
t1 = ωt1/(2π),
corresponding population-transfer times
given in terms of ﬁeld cycles, remain invariant, as long
as γ1 and γ2 are kept constant.

Since the unitary transformation (5) which gives the
adiabatic states also depends on E0, ω, ω10 and x10
through γ1 and γ2, it also remains invariant in this case.
Thus, this invariance must also hold for the populations
2 =
n (t)
of these states, i.e.,
|
Another quantity of interest is the dipole acceleration.
A quick inspection of Eq. (11) shows that this quantity
does not remain invariant under the above-stated trans-
formations.
In fact, it scales as x10 multiplied by the
square of the energy. The dipole matrix element scales
as x10

10 = λ−1/2x10. Thus, ¨x(t) = λ3/2 ¨x(t′).

These parameters are typical for solid-state systems and give

They are obtained from those in Fig. 4 using a scaling trans-
formation with λ = 1/2000. For this set of parameters, we
have used a ﬁve times smaller timestep than in the previous
ﬁgures and double precision. The dipole acceleration is given
in atomic units and the time is given in units of the ﬁeld cycle.
The ﬁeld is switched on linearly within two cycles.

The above-stated conclusions are conﬁrmed by Fig. 12.
In this ﬁgure, we display the same physical quantities as
in Fig. 4 for a completely diﬀerent set of parameters
which, however, yield the same γ1 and γ2. The popu-

expected, identical to those depicted in Fig. 4. This is
true not only for the oscillations which are periodic in
T /2, but also for the global enveloping functions. The
scaling with λ3/2 is also observed for the dipole accelera-
tion (Fig. 12(b)). The parameters used in the ﬁgure are
typical for quantum wells and solid-state systems [24].

are displayed in Table IV. Part (a) shows the whole spectra,
whereas part (b) displays both spectra for harmonic order
10 < N < 20, such that their substructure can be seen. The

Another interesting aspect concerns the resulting har-
monic spectra. Even though, in absolute terms, these
spectra have diﬀerent cutoﬀ frequencies and diﬀerent
global intensities, for equal γ1 and γ2 they have the same
shape. Not only the number of harmonics is the same.
In addition, all substructure in the spectra looks strik-
ingly similar. These features can be easily understood:
the global intensity decrease is related to the decrease
in amplitude of the dipole acceleration and the identical
shapes are a consequence of the fact that the populations
of the adiabatic states, as well as all oscillations present in
the dipole acceleration, remain invariant under the scale
transformations discussed here. This is shown in Figs.
13(a) and (b), for several dilatation factors λ. The corre-
sponding ﬁeld and two-level atom parameters are given
in Table IV.

ω = 0.05 a.u., ω10 = 0.409 a.u. and x10 = 1.066 a.u., re-
spectively. These parameters give γ1 = 0.0378, γ2 = 0.3094,
whereas the ones in Fig. 4 yield γ1 = 0.0391, γ2 = 0.3197.
Part (a) shows the whole spectra, whereas part (b) displays
both spectra for harmonic order 10 < N < 20, such that their
substructure can be seen. The ﬁeld is switched on linearly
within two cycles.

On the other hand, the behavior of the system can al-
ready be altered by small variations in γ1 and γ2. For
instance, in Fig. 14 we consider a slightly larger ﬁeld am-
plitude than in Fig. 4, which give diﬀerent γ1 and γ2. In
this case, one observes a radically diﬀerent pattern for the

ation [Fig. 14(b)]. As a direct consequence, the spectra
does not exhibit the same substructure [Figs. 15(a) and

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The results discussed in the previous sections lead
to the main conclusion that the three-step model and
the two-level atom are not completely diﬀerent physi-
cal pictures for describing high-harmonic generation, as
commonly believed.
Indeed, in both models, this phe-
nomenon takes place as a result of a three-step process.
Hints that a correspondence between both physical pic-
tures might exist have been provided in the literature
[14,20]. We go however beyond such studies, giving evi-
dence that a three-step mechanism exists in the two-level
atom case and analysing its features in detail.

In the usual form of the three-step model, there is pop-
ulation transfer from the atomic ground state to a state in

12

−

the continuum, i.e., tunneling or multiphoton ionization.
The electron then propagates in the continuum within a
t0, gaining a certain amount of
time interval τ = t1
kinetic energy which is converted into harmonic radia-
tion at a time t1, when there is population transfer from
the continuum to the ground state, i.e., recombination.
In the two-level atom framework, a very similar process
takes place: there is population transfer from the ﬁeld-
dressed state
at a time t0
to the state
for which an avoided crossing occurs. Subsequently, the
system acquires energy from the ﬁeld within the interval
t0, and, at a further time t1, when population
τ = t1
φA
transfer from
takes place, this
energy is released in form of harmonic radiation. Thus,
the main diﬀerence between the three-step model and the
two-level atom physical pictures is that in the latter case,
the three steps do not involve a continuum state, but a
ﬁeld-dressed bound state.

Further similarities are observed in the time proﬁle of
high-harmonic generation. In both cases, the population
transfers which contribute to the generation of a partic-
ular set of harmonics occur at very speciﬁc times. In the
usual three-step model, these times are such that the en-
ergy of a particular harmonic must be equal to the sum
of the kinetic energy of the electron upon return and the
atomic ionization potential. The same line of argumen-
tation holds in the two-level case, but now the harmonic
energy must be equal to the energy diﬀerence between
the adiabatic states at these times.

Speciﬁcally for monochromatic driving ﬁelds, both
models share several features. Both in the three-step
model and in the two-level atom case, there is a single
time corresponding to the generation of the cutoﬀ har-
monic.
In the former model, this time corresponds to
the maximal kinetic energy the electron may have, upon
return, whereas in the latter model, it gives the maxi-
mal energy diﬀerence between the adiabatic states. Also
for both cases, this time splits into two sets of times as
the harmonic energy decreases. The constructive inter-
ference between the corresponding population transfers
originates the plateau in the high-harmonic spectra. This
pattern repeats itself every half cycle of the driving ﬁeld.
This is a direct consequence of the periodicity of the rel-
evant physical quantities, namely the electron kinetic en-
ergy in the three-step model [35] and the adiabatic ener-
gies εA
± in the two-level atom case. All these features are
observed as peaks in the Gabor transform of the dipole
acceleration. In the three-step model framework, analo-
gous studies have been performed in [3].

Also for bichromatic driving ﬁelds, there are several
characteristics which are present in both models. A good
example is the multiple cutoﬀ structure. Indeed, the har-
monic spectra in this case may exhibit several cutoﬀs,
which, depending on the model in question, are given by
the maxima of either the electron kinetic energy or of
the energy diﬀerence between the adiabatic states. The
number of these cutoﬀs, as well as their energies or the
corresponding population-transfer times, are determined

by the frequency ratio n, the ﬁeld-strength ratio ζ and
the relative phase θ. For both the three-step model and
the two-level atom, all peaks in the Gabor spectra can
be traced back to the population-transfer times. In one
or the other case, these population transfers occur either
between the adiabatic states (Sec. IV), or between the
ground-state and the continuum [8].

Similarities between the two models are also observed
for the probability that the “ﬁrst step”, i.e., population
transfer, takes place. In the three-step model, this prob-
ability, per unit time, is roughly given by the quasi-static
] [33]. A strong ﬁeld
E(t0)
/
tunneling rate
|
|
E(t0) at the ionization time t0 yields strong harmonics at
the recombination time t1. This relation is very useful for
controlling harmonic spectra, as for instance the relative
intensities of a double plateau (see, e.g., [8,9] for concrete
examples). Within the two-level atom framework and in
the monochromatic case, to ﬁrst approximation, the ﬁeld-
dependent terms of the two-level Hamiltonian can be lin-
earized at the crossings [14]. Thus, the population trans-
fer between the exchanged states can be computed by
means of the Landau-Zener model [28,31]. This probabil-
′π/(2x10E0)],
ity is approximately given by
such that the Rabi frequency, in the two-level atom, plays
a similar role as E(t0) in the three-step model. In gen-
eral, however, there is not always a simple expression for
the population transfer at a level crossing [28,32], such
has to be computed according to the problem at
that
may be rather complicated for
hand. For instance,
bichromatic ﬁelds. This is a limitation for controlling
high-harmonic spectra in this latter case.

A particularity of the two-level atom is that the very
same distortions caused by the additional ﬁeld in the
ﬁeld-dressed energies, as functions of time, are also
2 and
n (t)
present in the adiabatic-state populations
|
in the dipole acceleration. Speciﬁcally for the bichro-
matic ﬁeld addressed in this paper, i.e., a ω
2ω ﬁeld,
the whole pattern is no longer periodic in T /2, but in T .
This is a consequence of the periodicity of the adiabatic
states, which changes with the additional driving wave.
A similar feature occurs in the three-step model frame-
work, due to an analogous change in the electron kinetic
energy upon return (see, e.g., [8,9] for a discussion of this
issue).

−

An interesting issue which is not discussed in this paper
concerns the inﬂuence of ionization or feedback mecha-
nisms on the time proﬁles of harmonic generation by a
two-level atom. In a previous paper it was shown that
the main contributions to harmonic generation from a
two-level atom whose states decayed according to quasi-
static ionization rates occurred at minimal ﬁeld. These
results did not agree with the bound-bound transitions
computed from the numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation for a gaussian potential with two strongly cou-
pled bound states [15]. The strikingly diﬀerent time pro-
ﬁles obtained in the present paper for HHG in a closed
two-level atom suggest, however, that these features are
stongly inﬂuenced by ionization. Therefore, more accu-

13

rate descriptions of ionization and an adequate feedback
mechanism from the continuum would be necessary in
the two-level atom case with unstable levels. The inﬂu-
ence of level widths on the population transfer between
quantum states is discussed in [36].

Finally, there are scaling laws which allow extending
the studies performed in this paper to a broader param-
eter range. In fact, we have shown that the important
parameters for determining the physical behavior of the
system are γ1 = ω/(2x10E0), and γ2 = ω10/(2x10E0),
which denote the ratio of the ﬁeld and transition fre-
quencies to the Rabi frequency, respectively. As long as
γ1 and γ2 are kept constant, driving ﬁelds of completely
diﬀerent strengths and frequencies acting on systems of
completely diﬀerent energy gaps can yield similar spec-
tra. For bichromatic ﬁelds, an additional requirement
for this invariance are ﬁxed ﬁeld-strength ratio ζ, ﬁeld-
frequency ratio n and relative phase θ.

tems are described very frequently by the semiconduc-
tor Bloch equations in the Hartree-Fock approximation
[25]. In case collective eﬀects can be neglected, the corre-
sponding Hamiltonian reduces to a two-level one-particle
Hamiltonian. In such a case, the results of the present
paper are expected to be applicable.

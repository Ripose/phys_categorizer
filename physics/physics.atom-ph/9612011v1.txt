Abstract

The long-range interactions of two atoms, of an atom and a dielectric wall,

of an atom and a perfectly conducting wall, and of an atom between two

perfectly conducting walls are calculated, including the eﬀects of retardation,

for Li using dynamic polarizabilities determined from highly correlated, vari-

ationally determined wave functions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Long-range interactions between two ground state atoms and between a ground state

atom and a surface are now measured using lasers and cold atoms or atomic beams. Pho-

toassociation spectroscopy has yielded strict limits on the values of coeﬃcients of dispersion

forces between two Rb atoms [1], two Na atoms [2], and two Li atoms [3] in their ground

states. Spectroscopy combined with deﬂection of alkali-metal atomic beams near surfaces [4]

or reﬂection of Na atoms from surfaces in atomic fountains [5,6] have made it possible to mea-

sure the coeﬃcients of atom-surface forces. The experiments are consistent with theoretical

models for the interaction potentials, but accurate theoretical estimations of the potentials

remain elusive for atoms other than H and He. The eﬀects of retardation, due to the ﬁ-

nite speed of light, cause the potentials to become weaker, approaching simple power laws

for asymptotically large distances. The advent of highly-correlated basis sets for Li using

multiple nonlinear variational parameters [7] makes it possible to perform well-converged

calculations of the dynamic electric polarizability functions, thereby enabling, as we will

show, precise evaluation of long-range interaction potentials, including retardation, for two

Li atoms, for a Li atom and a dielectric or perfectly conducting wall, and for a Li atom

between two perfectly conducting walls.

II. FORMULATION

A. Atom-atom interactions

The eﬀect of retardation on the long-range induced dipole interactions of two atoms was

ﬁrst investigated by Casimir and Polder [8] and the eﬀects on higher induced multipoles by

Au and Feinberg [9], Jenkins, Salam, and Thirunamachandran [10], and Power and Thiruna-

machandran [11]. In this paper, the dipolar-dipolar and dipolar-quadrupolar interactions

are considered, the higher multipolar interactions being negligible. We use the expression for

the retarded dipolar-quadrupolar interaction of Power and Thirunamachandran [11] which

2

diﬀers from the approximate expression obtained by Au and Feinberg [9].

The interaction potential between two like atoms including the eﬀects of retardation can

be written [8,11]

The coeﬃcients W4 and W6 can also be derived from an analysis in perturbation theory

of the orbit-orbit term arising from the Breit interaction in the Pauli approximation [13].

Expanding Power and Thirunamachandran’s result for −C8f8(R) for small R, according to

(11), we ﬁnd a value of W6 a factor of 3

2 times larger than the value of W6 resulting from
the theory of Au and Feinberg (see Eq. (4.21) of [14]). This resolves the discrepancy of 3

found in [14], between the value of WLL,4;2 for H from Johnson, Epstein, and Meath [15],

who evaluated terms from the Breit interaction in the Pauli approximation [13], and the

value of W6 evaluated for H in [14] using the Au and Feinberg formulation.

Expressions for the interaction potential of an atom and a dielectric wall, including

the eﬀects of retardation, have been given by Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii [16],

Parsegian [17], and Tikochinsky and Spruch [18]. For a wall with a dielectric constant ǫ, the

potential can be written [18]

The calculations of the wave functions and the polarizability response functions have been

described previously in, respectively,

[7] and [12]. We brieﬂy summarize the procedures.

where µt denotes a sextuple of integer powers j1, j2, j3, j12, j23, and j31, index t labels

diﬀerent sets of nonlinear parameters αt, βt and γt. Except for some truncations, all terms

are included such that

j1 + j2 + j3 + j12 + j23 + j31 ≤ Ω .

Xt X

× (angular function)(spin function) .

(37)

A complete optimization is performed with respect to all the nonlinear parameters. The

screened hydrogenic wave function is also included explicitly in the basis set.

The dynamic polarizabilities are evaluated using eﬀective oscillator strengths and tran-

sition energies obtained from the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a basis set of S

symmetry for the ground state and of P and D symmetry, respectively, for the intermediate

states corresponding to the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities. The basis sets were the

size 919 set from [12] for the S symmetry and the size 1846 sets from [12] for the P and the

D symmetries. A detailed discussion of the evaluation of αl(iω) can be found in [12]. The

static polarizabilities have the values α1(0) = 164.111(2) and α2(0) = 1 423.266(5) [12].

Values of the coeﬃcient W4 for two Li atoms have been determined by Margoliash and

Meath [22] and by Easa and Shukla [23]. Using our functions α1(iω) and α2(iω), we de-

termined the coeﬃcients W4 and W6 using, respectively, (10) and (12), and the results are

compared with previous results in Table I. We also calculated the coeﬃcients f6(R) and

f8(R) using (5) and (7) at various values of R. The results are given in Table III and

Fig. 1. The values of the dipole-dipole potential −C6f6(R)/R6 are in agreement with, but

are more accurate than, those given in Ref. [14], calculated using a model potential method.

The values of the dipole-quadrupole potential −C8f8(R)/R8 replace those given in Ref. [14],

which were calculated using the expression of Au and Feinberg as discussed above. The

dipole-quadrupole potential is usually of secondary importance due to its 1/R8 power law

behavior.

Using the polarizability function α1(iω) we evaluated VAtD(R, ǫ) for values of ǫ = 2.123

and 2.295 corresponding to, respectively, fused silica and BK-7 glass. The values are listed

in Table IV and illustrated in Fig. 2 for values of R up to 5000a0. For larger values of R,

the potential can be obtained from (18). The values of φ(ǫ) from our calculations are listed

in Table V and they are in agreement with the representative values given in Fig. 10 of

8

Ref. [16].

Three approximations V ′

AtD, V ′′

AtD, and V ′′′

AtD for V ∞

AtD were obtained by Spruch and

Tikochinsky by imposing the requirements that the interaction be exact for ǫ ≈ ∞ and for

ǫ ≈ 1, see Eqs. (4.5), (4.9), and (4.12) of [19]. Expressing the approximations as ratios to

the exact potential at very large distances, we have

and

where

We calculated the ratios appearing in (38)–(40) using our values of φ(ǫ) and the results are

presented in Fig. 3. Our results indicate that the second approximation deﬁned by (39) is

the most accurate, diﬀering by about 6% at most from the exact value of the potential. The

third approximation was developed for small values of ǫ where it is seen to be somewhat less

accurate than the second approximation.

The interaction potential for a Li atom and a perfectly conducting wall was evaluated

from (24)–(26). The value for the coeﬃcient C3 is in excellent agreement with previous

determinations, listed in Table II, particularly with those calculated from the alternative

expression

which follows from integration of (25), where N is the number of electrons. Note that only

the ground state wave function is required to evaluate (42). For Table II we used expectation

from (26) and values are listed in Table IV. The present calculations of the potential values

are in agreement with, but are more accurate than, those given in Ref. [25].

The potential VM AtM (z, L) was evaluated using (29) for a range of wall separations L

and distances z of the atom from the midpoint. Values of the energy shift arising from the

potential for values of L and z that might be realized in an experiment are given in Fig. 4.

The expressions involving dielectric walls in this paper were obtained under the approx-

imation ǫ(ω) ≈ ǫ(0) ≡ ǫ, where ǫ(ω) is the frequency-dependent dielectric function of the

wall. This is an excellent approximation for R ∼ ∞, but at smaller R it could lead to

signiﬁcant error if resonances play a role.

FIG. 4. The energy shift arising from the wall-atom-wall potential for various values of the wall

separation L and the distance of the atom from the midpoint z. Only the values for z > 0 are

shown as the energy shift is symmetric about the z = 0 plane.

Abstract. A new version of the R-matrix Floquet theory for laser-assisted
electron-atom scattering is presented. The theory is non-perturbative and
applicable to a non-relativistic many-electron atom or ion in a homogeneous
linearly polarized ﬁeld.
It is based on the use of channel functions built from
ﬁeld-dressed target states, which greatly simpliﬁes the general formalism.

1. Introduction

With the widespread availability of powerful lasers, the interaction of atomic systems
with intense electromagnetic radiation has become the subject of much study. A
variety of multiphoton phenomena have been observed, remarkable by their non-
linearity. The ﬁeld may induce new processes that can only occur through the
absorption or emission of more than one photon. Multiphoton ionization, above-
threshold ionization and harmonic generation have attracted most interest, while
electron-atom collisions in the presence of a laser ﬁeld have received comparatively
less attention. These are commonly described as laser-assisted, in that the ﬁeld is not
required for scattering to occur, although its presence can give rise to new inelastic
processes such as simultaneous electron-photon excitation.

Relatively little experimental work has been devoted to electron-atom collisions
in a laser ﬁeld. A number of groups have investigated elastic or free-free scattering
on rare gas targets (usually argon) in a CO2 laser ﬁeld at intensities up to 109
W/cm2 (Andrick and Langhans 1976, 1978; Weingartshofer et al 1977, 1979, 1983;
Bader 1986; Wallbank et al 1987a,b, 1992). Measurements have been performed
over a wide range of incident electron energies, mostly at large scattering angles
corresponding to backward scattering, for geometries in which the polarization axis is
either parallel to the momentum of the incident electron, or parallel to the direction of
momentum transfer. More recent experiments (Wallbank and Holmes 1993, 1994a,b)
measured angular distributions for geometries in which the polarization axis is almost
perpendicular to the momentum transfer. The ﬁrst experimental investigation of
simultaneous electron-photon excitation was performed by Mason and Newell (1987,
1989) on helium in the ﬁeld of a CW CO2 laser at intensities from 104 to 105 W/cm2.
This was soon followed by studies at intensities up to 108 W/cm2 (Wallbank et al
1988, 1990). The only experiment at a higher frequency is that of Luan et al (1991)
who used a Nd-YAG laser of intensity 1010 W/cm2. Details can be found in the review
by Mason (1993).

A larger number of

theoretical studies have been undertaken, and are
comprehensively reviewed by Ehlotzky et al (1998). The challenge for theory lies in
accurately treating both radiative couplings and the dynamics of the collisional system
over very large distances: each of the electron-target, laser-electron and laser-target
interactions needs to be taken into account. If one of these dominates, a perturbative
approach can be adopted. In early work on free-free scattering for example, Bunkin
and Fedorov (1966) treated the laser-electron interaction to all orders using Gordan-
Volkov wave functions, and the electron-target interaction to ﬁrst order using the
Born approximation. The dressing of the target by the ﬁeld was neglected. Kroll
and Watson (1973) included higher order terms in the Born series to obtain a formula
valid when the scattering potential is weak or when the frequency of the laser ﬁeld
is small (the low frequency approximation). An alternative approach for treating
the laser-atom interaction non-perturbatively is furnished by Floquet theory. This
is applicable to periodic Hamiltonians and reduces the problem to be solved to that
of a set of time-independent coupled equations. The Floquet expansion has been
combined for example with a partial wave expansion for potential scattering (Dimou
and Faisal 1987), and with the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation to study low-
energy free-free scattering by various potentials (Kylstra and Joachain 1998, 1999).
Most work on inelastic processes has concentrated on high collision energies using
methods based on the Born approximation (Rahman and Faisal 1976, Jetzke et al

RMF theory of laser-assisted electron-atom scattering

1984, 1987, Francken et al 1988). Lower energies have been considered mainly within
the low-frequency approximation, which is valid for CO2 lasers (Geltman and Maquet
1989, Mittleman 1993, Fainstein et al 1995) but not for Nd-YAG. An attempt to
go beyond this approximation using a pseudo-potential model has been discussed by
Faisal (1987).

There now exists a variety of powerful computational methods for the study
of electron collisions with complex atoms. R-matrix theory for example has been
developed over many years (Burke and Berrington 1993, Burke et al 1994) and is
now used regularly for the production of vital atomic data needed in a variety of
applications. The main feature of this theory is the division of conﬁguration space
into inner and outer regions, in each of which the wave function can be expanded
in a locally adapted basis. The global wave function is then built by matching the
solutions at their common boundary, using the inverse of the log-derivative matrix
or R-matrix. An extension of the method to multiphoton processes was proposed by
Burke et al (1990, 1991, hereafter referred to as paper I), using the Floquet expansion
to describe the interaction of the atomic system with a laser ﬁeld. A practical
solution in the outer region was developed by D¨orr et al (1992), hereafter referred
to as paper II. Subsequently, this R-matrix Floquet (RMF) theory has been used to
study multiphoton ionization of numerous atoms and ions, laser-induced degenerate
states (LIDS) and harmonic generation (see for example the review by Joachain et al
2000). A version describing multiphoton processes involving diatomic molecules has
recently been developed (Burke et al 2000) and applied to multiphoton ionization of
H2 (Colgan et al 2001).

In papers I and II, the RMF theory was presented mainly with multiphoton
ionization in mind. Its application to laser-assisted scattering has been described in
detail only for the case of a potential (electron-proton scattering, D¨orr et al 1995). We
have since extended the method to laser-assisted scattering by atomic targets. We ﬁrst
applied it to the study of free-free processes in e−–H (Charlo et al 1998) and e−–He
(Charlo 1999) collisions in a CO2 laser ﬁeld. We showed that the diﬀerential cross
sections display a deep minimum when the momentum transfer is nearly perpendicular
to the direction of the laser ﬁeld, in accordance with the low frequency approximation.
More recently, we have studied the simultaneous electron-photon excitation of helium
in a Nd-YAG laser ﬁeld (Terao-Dunseath et al 2001), for which the low frequency
approximation is no longer valid. We showed that the cross section is dominated by
the He−(1s2s2 2S) resonance and that a strong AC Stark mixing occurs between the
1s2s 3S and 1s2p 3Po states. The purpose of this paper is to present the modiﬁcations
that needed to be introduced in the original R-matrix Floquet theory in order to
identify unambigously ﬁeld-dressed target states and to calculate cross sections for
laser-assisted scattering by a general atomic or ionic system.

Atomic units are used throughout. We shall also use the Fano-Racah phase

convention for the spherical harmonics, with

Yℓm(θ, φ) = iℓY CS

ℓm (θ, φ)

where CS implies the usual Condon-Shortley phase.

2. The Floquet approach: basic equations and properties

We consider the scattering of an electron by an atomic system composed of an inﬁnitely
heavy nucleus of charge Z and N electrons in a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld. We

4

suppose that the duration of the laser pulse is much longer than the collision time
and that the ﬁeld is homogeneous over the interaction region. We therefore adopt the
dipole approximation with a ﬁeld described by the vector potential

A(t) = ˆz A0 cos ωt

where ω is the angular frequency and we have chosen the Z-axis parallel to the direction
of polarization.

The wave function for this system satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation

The presence of the linearly polarized laser ﬁeld breaks the spherical symmetry
of the system by introducing a preferred direction in space so that the total atomic
angular momentum L is no longer deﬁned. Its projection M along the polarization
axis is however conserved since the system is invariant under rotation around this
axis. The dipole operator connects atomic states of opposite parities, so that equation
(2) separates for well-deﬁned values of the total atom-laser parity Π. As we neglect
relativistic corrections, the total atomic spin S and projection MS are also good
quantum numbers. In what follows, we shall work in subspaces with ﬁxed quantum
numbers M ΠSMS, which will usually not be explicitly indicated.

As the Schr¨odinger equation (2) includes a time-dependent potential which is

periodic, it admits solutions in the form of a Floquet-Fourier expansion

Ψ(X N +1, t) = e−iEt

e−inωtΨn(X N +1)

(3)

∞

n=−∞

where E is the quasi-energy of the solution. The conservation of total parity Π implies
that each Floquet component in the expansion (3) includes atomic wave functions of
well-deﬁned parity, alternating with the parity of the Floquet index n. By substituting
(3) into (2) and projecting on a particular Floquet component, we obtain an inﬁnite
set of time-independent coupled equations for the Ψn(X N +1) that can be solved using
standard methods.

Another general property of the Floquet-Fourier type solutions (3) is the Shirley

symmetry (Shirley 1965):

This implies that equivalent sets of solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation (2) exist,
each characterised by quasi-energies with period ω and Floquet components identical
apart from a shift in their indices.

3. R-matrix inner region

In R-matrix theory, the inner region is deﬁned as the portion of conﬁguration space
where the radial coordinate of each electron is smaller than the radius a of the sphere
encompassing the target states. The treatment of the problem in this region, which
is analogous to that of atomic bound states, has been fully presented in paper I.
It is however useful to recall the equations that are essential for understanding the
treatment of laser-assisted scattering in the outer region.

Since all the radial coordinates are small, it is appropriate to deﬁne the wave

function in the length gauge by the unitary transformation

We ﬁrst determine a discrete R-matrix basis

satisfying the
usual R-matrix boundary conditions. This is done by diagonalizing the hermitian
Hamiltonian H L
F +LB, where LB is a Bloch operator cancelling the surface terms at r =
a arising from the kinetic operators. The Floquet-Fourier components ΨL
kn(X N +1)
of the R-matrix basis functions are expanded in a set of fully antisymmetrised
(N +1)-electron functions which are formed by coupling channel functions with deﬁned
symmetry Γ = LM πSMS, (where π is the parity of the (N+1)-electron system)

the target orbitals are also included in order to account for short-range correlation.

By projecting (8) onto the channel functions (9) and onto the nth component in

In principle the summation in (10) is inﬁnite,
in practice it is truncated. An
approximation for the truncated part is provided by a Buttle correction (Buttle 1967).

4. Close-coupling equations using ﬁeld-dressed target states

The outer region is deﬁned as the portion of conﬁguration space where the N electrons
of the target have a radial coordinate smaller than a while that of the collisional
electron is larger. Exchange between the collisional electron and the target electrons
is negligible. From now on, we can drop the index N + 1 from the coordinates of the
collisional electron without possibility of confusion.

To solve the Schr¨odinger equation in the outer region, we adopt a close-coupling
expansion of the total wave function. Using the same channel functions (9) as in the
inner region, we could write

N is the residual charge of the target. All quantities operating
where z = Z

range multipole potentials α(λ)/rλ arising from the interaction of the collisional
electron with the target, together with the couplings of all the electrons with the

laser ﬁeld. The interaction of the target with the ﬁeld does not depend on the
coordinate of the collisional electron and therefore gives rise to non-diagonal constant
couplings in equation (13). In paper I (appendix A2.1.2), these terms were removed
by diagonalizing the constant coupling matrix, which amounts to deﬁning channel
functions with the ﬁeld-dressed target states coupled to the angular and spin wave
functions of the collisional electron. This approach has two disavantages. Couplings
in the outer region are ﬁrst deﬁned in the channel basis (9) where their expression
is cumbersome, then transformed into the ﬁeld-dressed target basis. Secondly, target
states diﬀering only by the sign of their magnetic quantum number Mi are degenerate
so that the diagonalization procedure can lead to any linear combination of the
solutions with

We now show that the equations in the outer region are greatly simpliﬁed by ﬁrst
determining the ﬁeld-dressed target states and using these to construct the channel
functions. The magnetic quantum numbers of the target and therefore of the collisional
electron are deﬁned unambigously and scattering cross sections can be obtained in a
straightforward way.

The ﬁeld-dressed target wave functions ΨT (X N , t) satisfy the time-dependent

5. Length to velocity gauge transformation and propagation in the
velocity gauge

In the outer region, the potential in the length gauge E(t)
r diverges as the radial
coordinate of the collisional electron increases.
It is therefore more appropriate to
express the interaction of this electron with the laser ﬁeld in the velocity gauge, where
the potential remains ﬁnite. We conveniently perform this gauge transformation at
r = a, although in principle it could be done at a larger distance. The relation
between the wave function in the length gauge ΨL(X N +1, t) and that in the velocity
gauge ΨV(X N +1, t) is

Since the gauge transformation applies only to the scattered electron, the channels

which is symmetric. A detailed discussion of the properties of RG has been presented
in paper II.

To propagate the matrix RG, we ﬁrst inverse it to obtain the log-derivative
matrix. We propagate this outwards using the method of Johnson and Manolopoulos
(Manolopoulos 1986) which allows oscillating potentials to be treated with relatively
large propagation steps. The propagated log-derivative matrix is then inverted back
to the matrix RG.

6. Scattering boundary conditions and asymptotic solutions

After propagating the R-matrix in the velocity gauge, we need to match to the
asymptotic solutions corresponding to the scattering boundary conditions. These can
easily be deﬁned if the close-coupling equations are asymptotically uncoupled, which is
not the case in the velocity gauge. We apply the Kramers-Henneberger transformation

this transformation is applied only to the collisional electron. The target electrons,
which are tightly bound to the nucleus, are kept in the length gauge. By substituting
(28) into (20), we obtain the close-coupling equations in the acceleration frame:

The scattering amplitudes are obtained from the K-matrix in a manner similar to
the ﬁeld-free case (see for example Smith 1971). Diﬀerences arise due to the presence
of the laser ﬁeld which breaks the spherical symmetry. We ﬁrst suppose that the target
is neutral and that the incoming electron has a momentum ki and a spin projection
µi while the outgoing electron has a momentum kf and a spin projection µf . The

The expression (35) is simpler than that in the ﬁeld-free case since the total angular

It is therefore not necessary
to uncouple the angular momenta of the target and scattered electron to deﬁne the

The diﬀerential cross section is obtained by taking the modulus square of (38),
averaging over the initial states and summing over the ﬁnal states. As in the ﬁeld-free
case, the total elastic cross section is not deﬁned as it diverges.

It should be stressed that the above formulae are for transitions between ﬁeld-
dressed target states. The Shirley symmetry implies that these can be grouped in

RMF theory of laser-assisted electron-atom scattering

→

equivalence classes, each with the same atomic structure and a quasi-energy spectrum
of period ω. When the AC Stark mixing is weak, these quasi-energies will lie close to
the ﬁeld-free thresholds shifted by an integer multiple of the photon energy. It is then
natural, though not necessary, to use these integers as labels, with the ﬁeld-dressed
states closest to the ﬁeld-free ones deﬁning the “zero-photon” thresholds. A transition
from state (a, M ) to state (b, N ) can therefore be interpreted as the atomic transition
photons. The collisional electron emerges with
M
b with net exchange of
a
|
a kinetic energy diﬀering by
ω from the kinetic energy associated with the

|
zero-photon transition. When the AC Stark mixing is very strong however, it may
be diﬃcult to identify the ﬁeld-dressed threshold as a ﬁeld-free threshold shifted by
a particular number of photon energies. For inelastic processes, we may choose a
particular transition between two ﬁeld-dressed states i and f as the “zero-photon”
transition for the associated atomic states. This can then be used as a reference for
counting the number of photons exchanged for transitions between other members of
the two sequences containing i and f .

8. Computational implementation

An advantage of the R-matrix Floquet theory is that it can re-use existing R-matrix
inner region computer codes for ﬁeld-free electron-atom collisions and photoionization
that have been developed over many years (Berrington et al 1978, 1987). The Fano-
Racah phase convention for the spherical harmonics used in those packages has to be
kept, which yields rather unusual expressions for the dipole matrix elements. This
also justiﬁes the choice of phase for the laser ﬁeld (7), since a real symmetric Floquet
Hamiltonian is more convenient from the computational point of view.

The ﬁrst task is to deﬁne a set of ﬁeld-free target wave functions. While in
principle any method could be used to determine these, in practice only the structure
programs CIV3 (Hibbert 1975) and SuperStructure (Eissner et al 1974) are interfaced
with the R-matrix codes. Once the target state energies, wave functions and dipole
matrices have been obtained, the ﬁeld-free R-matrix inner region codes are used to
calculate dipoles, energies and surface amplitudes for the (N+1)-electron system. The
next step, MPB, builds and diagonalizes the Floquet Hamiltonian matrix H L
F + LB and
calculates the surface amplitudes (11) required to construct the R-matrix (10) in the
inner region. In the current implementation, this stage is parallelized using SCALAPACK
(Blackford et al 1997). The above steps need only be performed once for ﬁxed laser
frequency and intensity as they are independent of the collision energy.

The program MPSCAT solves the scattering problem in the outer region. For each
collision energy, the R-matrix from the inner region is transformed into the ﬁeld-
dressed channel representation, and from the length into the velocity gauge.
Its
inverse is then propagated from the inner region boundary out to a speciﬁed distance
using a log-derivative propagator (Manolopoulos 1986). The propagated solutions are
matched with those from the asymptotic expansion (33) to give the K-matrix, from
which cross sections can be calculated.

In the ﬁeld-free case, the R-matrix is symmetric by construction. This is also the
case in the length gauge, but not in the velocity gauge since the Floquet expansion is
truncated and the transformation matrix A (26) is not quite unitary. Adopting the
velocity gauge in the inner region would yield a symmetric R-matrix but the Buttle
correction then requires non-diagonal elements that are diﬃcult to evaluate. The
propagation method we employ however does not suppose the matrix to be symmetric.

RMF theory of laser-assisted electron-atom scattering

16

The transformation from the acceleration frame into the velocity gauge is not unitary
for the same reason. As a consequence, the K-matrix is not symmetric. In practice, we
ﬁnd that this does not aﬀect the cross section, provided the full not quite symmetric
K-matrix is used to determine the S-matrix and the contributions of the channels with
the largest angular momenta or largest (absorption and emission) Floquet indices are
not included.

From the computational point of view, calculations for transitions between two
continuum states are more demanding than for bound-free transitions since more
partial waves need to be included. It is also necessary to integrate over large interaction
distances, especially to obtain converged angular distributions. Many operations can
be written in matrix form, which can be eﬃciently performed using the BLAS and
LAPACK (Anderson et al 1999) libraries. All the calculation parameters, such as the
number of target states, continuum orbitals, angular momenta, Floquet components
as well as the propagation distance, can be varied independently to ensure the
convergence of the results.

9. Conclusion

The R-matrix Floquet theory provides a powerful tool to study the behaviour of
a general atomic system in a laser ﬁeld. The method is fully ab initio and non-
perturbative and allows in particular an exact treatment of all dynamic and radiative
couplings. The general approach for studying electron-atom scattering in a laser ﬁeld
is similar to the treatment of multiphoton ionization presented in papers I and II, but
several aspects need more careful consideration, in particular the boundary conditions.
As we have shown in this paper, it is necessary to deﬁne a priori the ﬁeld-dressed target
states to identify the collision channels and calculate cross sections. This however has
the advantage of greatly simplifying the formulae in the outer region.

As in the standard R-matrix theory on which our method is based, only one
electron can be treated in the outer region. The energy of the collisional electron
and the ﬁeld strength must not be too high, so that ionization or photoionization
of the target does not occur. The Floquet approach is furthermore only valid for
a periodic ﬁeld, which again limits the ﬁeld intensity as most powerful lasers are
pulsed. Extensions of the R-matrix Floquet theory to treat stronger ﬁelds are however
possible. A time-dependent R-matrix theory has already been proposed by Burke and
Burke (1997) to handle non-periodic ﬁelds in a one-dimensional model, which could
be generalised to three dimensions. There is furthermore no fundamental obstacle in
combining for instance the R-matrix pseudo-state method (Bartschat et al 1996) or
the two-dimensional R-matrix propagator (Dunseath et al 1996) with the Floquet
approach to include the double continuum. These methods are computationally
prohibitive at the moment but could become realistic as the power of computers
increases.

The theory presented in this paper has been successfully applied to the study of
free-free processes and simultaneous electron-photon excitation (Charlo et al 1998,
Charlo 1999, Terao-Dunseath et al 2001). These were the ﬁrst accurate non-
perturbative calculations including a realistic multi-electron representation of the
collision system. We are currently continuing our study of electron-helium scattering
in a laser ﬁeld (CO2, Nd-YAG) and intend to apply the method to other complex
targets of experimental interest.

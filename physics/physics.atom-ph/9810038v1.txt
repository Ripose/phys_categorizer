Autler – Townes doublet probed by strong ﬁeld

This paper deals with the Autler – Townes doublet structure. Applied driv-
ing and probing laser ﬁelds can have arbitrary intensities. The explanation is
given of the broadening of doublet components with the growth of probing ﬁeld
intensity, which was observed in experiment. The eﬀects of Doppler averaging
are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The spectroscopy of three-level systems occupies a highly important place in nonlinear
spectroscopy. In addition to saturation or power broadening of resonance [1], new remarkable
eﬀects appear: ﬁeld splitting [2] and truly coherent processes (such as Raman scattering
or two-photon processes). The most clear issue is the absorption spectrum of three-level
systems interacting with two monochromatic waves within perturbation theory in intensity
of one of the waves — probe ﬁeld spectrum [3–7]. Some eﬀorts were made to construct the
theory where both waves are strong [8,9]. In [8], the coherences in the equations for the
density matrix were excluded, and equations containing only populations were derived. As
a result, the probabilities of transitions induced by ﬁelds were renormalized and expressed
in terms of populations only. Unfortunately, our intuition in predicting the behavior of such
systems is poor yet, it is diﬃcult to foresee the result without solving the equations. The
computation of three-level system with a great number of parameters (relaxation constants
of levels, waves detunings and strengths) [9] is hard to analyze.

However, power of light has increased since early experiments, as one needs to get better
light conversion or more controllable setup. In experiment [10] Λ-scheme interacting with
two waves exhibits, at ﬁrst sight, strange behavior. When the intensity of comparatively
weak wave increases, the components of Autler – Townes doublet broaden in its absorption
spectrum; ﬁnally the doublet is transformed to a single line.

A three-level system with two strong ﬁelds can be a part of the scheme of four-wave
resonant mixing. The study of this area is progressing rapidly, since it gives a hope to
obtain coherent CW short-wave radiation. To understand the whole picture it is useful at
ﬁrst to consider the part of a system that interacts with strong ﬁelds.

The aim of the present paper is to analyze qualitatively the eﬀects arising from increasing
the power of weak wave in Λ-scheme.
In what follows we discuss the general features of
multi-level systems and the possibility of reducing them to simple two-level systems. We
use the probability amplitudes approach and the “dressed” state concept (see [11,12]) to

understand the spectra. The energies of “dressed” states are identiﬁed with the poles of the
Green function of master equations in ω-representation. We are not interested in intrinsic
relaxation processes in an atomic system and this allows us to avoid introducing the density
matrix. It reduces the system of N 2 equations for the elements of the density matrix to the
system for N probability amplitudes (here N = 3).

The paper is organized as follows:
In sections II,III the equations of motion and their Green function are described.
In
section IV the energies of “dressed” states are discussed. Section V is devoted to the calcu-
lation of probe ﬁeld spectrum in a four-level system — linear response of a three-level one;
it shows the beneﬁts of Green function. Section VI presents the absorption spectra of the
strong ﬁeld. In section VII we brieﬂy consider the question of the Doppler broadening of
spectra. In section VIII we ﬁnally summarize essential aspects of the paper.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

Consider the atomic system consisting of three excited levels and its resonant interaction
with two electromagnetic waves with frequencies ω1, ω2 (see ﬁgure 1). Hereafter we assume
that the wave amplitudes are not changed essentially by interaction (optically thin media).
Thus, we do not consider here the eﬀects of light propagation. One can think that there is a
thin layer with absorbing atoms and light travels trough it almost without absorption. Here
we also do not take into account the motion of atoms, i.e., we do not consider the eﬀects
connected with inhomogeneous broadening of absorption spectra. Then the time evolution
of atomic wave function is described by the Schr¨odinger equation (¯h = 1)

The formulation of the problem of light absorption is the following: at the moment t0
the atom is excited to the state A = A0. Then the time evolution of A is governed by (4),

Because equation (4) is time-independent, the power P does not depend on t0. Then one can

IV. DRESSED STATES

Here, for simplicity, we neglect relaxation constants. In fact, the resonance widths under
power broadening depend on the ratio of Γs even when the latter are small. Therefore, the
contents of this paragraph is useful for the case of equal relaxation constants (or, maybe,
when they are comparable to each other) or for ﬁnding resonance positions in the absorption
spectrum of auxiliary probe ﬁeld. The energies of the dressed states satisfy algebraic equation
(10). Let us write it in the form

If we consider the energy levels of the system “atom+ﬁeld”, then we will see the triples of

close levels. For weak ﬁelds these levels are:

1st ﬁeld, and n2 quanta in the 2nd one),

. If we consider

the system within perturbation theory, we use the atomic basis of states. They are close
in energy; in resonant approximation the ﬁeld-induced transitions occur only inside each
triple. The “dressed” energy levels are found from the secular equation for each triple (10).
In resonant approximation the triples are independent.

The resonances in the spectra occur when two eigenvalues λ are close to each other. The
minimal distance between them gives the order of resonance width. The general idea is
that one can consider two close λs separately from others and write the quadratic secular
equation for them. These two eigenvalues are pushed apart by the intermixing — the general
scenario due to the Hermitity of interaction.

The energies λ1 and λ3 are split by the 2nd wave, whose intensity is multiplied by the factor

for λ1 and M1. The coeﬃcients M1,2 were called “memory factors” or “correlation factors”
[5,13]. One can diagonalize the Hamiltonian ˆH neglecting the 2nd ﬁeld G2 and turn from
to the states dressed by the 1st ﬁeld having energies λ1,2. Then

The ﬁrst pair of poles corresponds to the simple resonance between levels 2 and 3 taking

that in ﬁgure 3(b) the narrower part of the spectrum goes to the left. For extremely high
values of G2 the second part of the spectrum becomes wider than the ﬁrst one (the width
becomes proportional to G2

The fact that the width of one of the two resonances is proportional to G2

corresponds to the following: the 2nd ﬁeld has the amplitude G2, which is much greater than

2nd resonance: to increase its width or to decrease its amplitude, both ways being used here.
Mathematically, the fourth-order algebraic equation for Ω2∗ is transformed to the second-
order algebraic equation, i.e., the coeﬃcients of Ω4

well known that the algebraic equation with small leading coeﬃcient ǫ has at least one root

VII. DOPPLER BROADENING OF SPECTRA

One can take into account the Doppler broadening of absorption spectra by substituting
k2v for Ω1 and Ω2 and integrating the result (22) with some distribution
k1v and Ω2 −
Ω1 −
of particles ˆρ(v). Consider the case of copropagating waves, where only a longitudinal
projection v|| of velocity is needed. When the Doppler width is inﬁnite, the answer for the
spectrum is the integral of the rational function p4(v||)/p6(v||) over velocity, where pn(x) is
the nth degree polynomial. Some simpliﬁcation takes place when k1 = k2 or ki = 0 for
some i = 1, 2. In the general case the expressions for velocity-averaged ˆ

derive and analyze. We will discuss the eﬀects of the Doppler broadening only qualitatively.

The turning point is the extreme point of velocity dependence of resonance frequencies Ω2∗,
i.e., at the turning point vtp we have (dΩ2∗/dv||)
|v||=vtp = 0. The spectra of this type are
well known (see, e.g., [15]). For the universal shape of asymmetric line due to the turning
point see [16]. When G2 ≪

G2 on the resonance position is neglected) for Ω2∗. The rough feature of the spectrum —
two narrow asymmetric resonance lines — remains, but the width of these lines depends on
G2 (see ﬁgure 5).

When Ω1 and G1 are compared to the Doppler width, an “isolated peak” appears in the
spectrum. Its width depends on Ω1, G1 (see [14,17]) and is larger than G2 in the general
case. The dependence of the width on Ω1 and G1 due to inhomogeneous broadening is not
a subject of the present paper, but at certain conditions the width decreases and becomes a
value of order G2.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

Let us summarize the description of the three-level system resonantly interacting with

two strong monochromatic waves.

The expression for the spectrum contains resonant denominators λI −

λ∗
J , where λI is the
energy of Ith “dressed” state. For N-level atomic system the dressed state energies satisfy
the algebraic equation of Nth order which is the secular equation for N levels of the system
“atom+ﬁeld” that are close in energy. When two dressed states are close to each other and
all other states are far from them in energy, the secular equation can be reduced to the
quadratic secular equation for these two states. The part of the atomic system consisting of
these two dressed states behaves as an ordinary two-level system.

9

If some connected component of strong ﬁelds covers the whole atomic system with N
states, then all N “dressed” states will be far from each other. As a consequence, all
resonances in the spectra will be wide. Atomic system can be covered by strong ﬁelds,
but strong ﬁelds can be disconnected (e.g., ﬁelds 1 and ν in ﬁgure 1(b) are strong). Then
the matrix elements between the states dressed by ﬁeld 1 and by ﬁeld ν will be small and
resonances will be narrow.

When the 2nd wave is weak we can think that it couples level 2 (see ﬁgure 1) and levels
1, 3 split by the 1st wave. The distance between the split levels is much greater than the
amplitude of the 2nd wave; these two transitions cannot be resonant simultaneously. Each
transition can be treated as a two-level system. The eﬀects of power broadening by the 2nd
wave appear. When the 2nd wave is very strong, only the two-level system coupled by it
remains and Autler – Townes doublet becomes blurred.

Indeed, the power width in a two-level system depends on the ratio of relaxation constants
Γ of levels even when the latter are small. Thus, the power width of Autler – Townes
component, due to the intensity of the 2nd wave, should also depend on the ratio of Γs. The
expressions will be similar to the well-known ones for a two-level system: one should take
Γ2 and the decay rate of the state “dressed” by the 1st ﬁeld.

In experiment [10] the 1st wave detuning Ω1 was equal to zero and two components had
= 0.
the same power width. It is interesting to observe the asymmetric broadening when Ω1 6
When the 2nd wave is generated in the media, self-consistent problem taking into account
energy losses should be solved. The doublet gives two frequencies of generation, which merge
together at a certain rate of reﬂection losses.

Detecting single atoms (qubits) is a key requirement for implementing quantum information processing on an
atom chip. The detector should ideally be integrated on the chip. Here we present and compare different methods
capable of detecting neutral atoms on an atom chip. After a short introduction to ﬂuorescence and absorption
detection we discuss cavity enhanced detection of single atoms. In particular we concentrate on optical ﬁber
based detectors such as ﬁber cavities and tapered ﬁber dipole traps. We discuss the various constraints in building
such detectors in detail along with the current implementations on atom chips. Results from experimental tests
of ﬁber integration are also described. In addition we present a pilot experiment for atom detection using a
concentric cavity to verify the required scaling.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Detecting single neutral atoms state selectively is one of
the essential ingredients for developing atomic physics based
quantum technologies, and a prerequisite of most quantum in-
formation experiments. The key question to be answered is
how to perform such measurements using a robust and scal-
able technology. Ultra cold atoms can be trapped and manip-
ulated using miniaturized atom chips [1]. So far, atom detec-
tion on atom chips is still based on unsophisticated methods.
Fluorescence detection and absorption imaging yield detec-
tion sensitivities not higher than 10%. The detection is also
restricted to ensembles of atoms.

On an atom chip micro fabricated wires and electrodes gen-
erate magnetic and electric ﬁelds that can be used to trap and
manipulate neutral atoms [1, 2]. The atoms are trapped a
few micrometers above the chip surface with high precision
and well deﬁned positions. Many components for integrated
matter wave technology have been demonstrated. Examples
are atom guides [3], combined magnetic/electrostatic traps of
various geometries [4], motors and shift registers [5], atomic
beam splitters [6, 7, 8, 9], and Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) in micro traps [10, 11, 12].

Integration of the detection optics on the atom chip is a
natural development for integrated matter wave manipulation.
Using macroscopically sized detectors, state sensitive detec-
tion with near unity efﬁciency has been realized, see for in-
stance [13] and references therein. Miniaturizing and inte-
grating these highly sophisticated and efﬁcient detectors is a
difﬁcult challenge.

The scope of this article is to explore how one can use the
techniques of integrated miniaturized optics for atom detec-
tion as proposed in [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and how to adapt and
implement real world devices to the atom chip and to on-chip
atom detection.

II. DETECTING SINGLE ATOMS

Single charged particles can be detected through their di-
rect electric interaction with their environment. Neutral atoms
however interact rather weakly with the environment. The
coupling of electromagnetic radiation to the atom is charac-
terized by the scattering cross section σscat

σscat =

σabs
1 + 4∆2 ,

where σabs = 3λ2/2π is the resonant scattering cross section
[47] and ∆ the normalized detuning given by ∆ = ω−ω0
Γ . Γ
is the atomic linewidth. The real part of the refractive index
results in a phase shift φ on the light ﬁeld. For far off-resonant
light ﬁelds this becomes

(1)

(2)

φ =

natσabs
4∆

,

where nat is the atomic column density. Atoms can be de-
tected by monitoring the scattered light in ﬂuorescence, in
absorption, or via the imprinted phase shift on the probing
light. The efﬁciency of the detection depends on the coupling
strength between the atom and the light, so it is of signiﬁcant
interest to optimize the atom-photon interaction. This requires
a high degree of control over the optical ﬁelds as well as the
dynamics of the atom.

In the following we will restrict ourselves to natσabs

1.
This is the case for detection of small atom numbers and for
resonant scattering far below atomic saturation.

measurements on the driving ﬁeld a complete atomic signa-
ture can be collected.

One way of detecting an atom is to observe its ﬂuorescence.
The basic idea is to drive a transition of the atom to an ex-
cited state with an external light ﬁeld and to detect the sponta-
neously emitted photons. In principle one scattered photon is
sufﬁcient to detect a single atom. The sensitivity of the detec-
tion and its ﬁdelity depend on the detection efﬁciency of the
scattered light and the suppression of background noise.

Modern photo detectors have a near unity efﬁciency, and
atom detection is limited by the amount of light collected.
Therefore high numerical aperture collection optics is desir-
able.
In a realistic setting the collection efﬁciency ηcoll is
much less than unity and it is essential to let each atom scatter
many photons. This is best achieved by driving closed transi-
tions. Using a model of a two-level atom with a small number
of excitations, the signal to noise ratio for single atom detec-
tion is given by:

SNRﬂ = ηcollσabs

Iinτ
A fb + ηcollσabs

,

s

(3)

where Iin is the incident photon ﬂux density and τ the mea-
surement time. The number of collected ﬂuorescence photons
is to be assumed ncoll = ηcollσabsjinτ
1. fb is the fraction
of incoming light which is scattered by anything else in the
beam and collected by the ﬂuorescence detector. A is the size
of the detection region imaged on the detector, with a total
background of Afb .

≫

In principle, there is no fundamental limit to the efﬁciency
of a ﬂuorescence detector as long as the atom is not lost from
the observation region. As an example: Using a NA 0.5 (F:1)
optics ηcoll = 6.25% and driving the D2 line of Rb (σRb
abs =
0.29 µm2) with about 1/10 saturation intensity (
107 photons
s−1 µm−2) one collects about 20 ﬂuorescence photons in 100
µs. Imaging a 10 µm2 detection region onto a photo detector
10−3 for single atom
one needs a suppression factor fb of
detection with a SNRﬂ
3. For trapped ions it is possible to
reach very high detection ﬁdelities. See for example Ref. [19].
Detection of cold single neutral atoms has been demonstrated
in many experiments. For instance, up to 20 atoms trapped in
a magneto-optical trap could be counted with a bandwidth of
100 Hz [20]. In Sec. IV A we discuss the prospects for atom
chip based ﬂuorescence detectors.

The disadvantage of ﬂuorescence detection is the destruc-
tive nature of the process. The internal state of the detected
atom will be altered, and heating of atoms due to spontaneous
emission is almost unavoidable.

B. Measuring the driving ﬁeld

While ﬂuorescence detection uses the spontaneously emit-
ted light, the presence of an atom will also inﬂuence the driv-
ing ﬁeld. This is described by the susceptibility of the atom.
The imaginary part of the susceptibility describes the absorp-
tion, and the real part the phase shift on the driving ﬁeld. By

1. Absorption on resonance

The atomic density can be measured by monitoring the at-
tenuation of the driving ﬁeld.
In the unsaturated case, this
situation is described by Lambert-Beer law. The transmitted
light intensity is given by:

The absorption signal of Eq. (4) provides a direct measure of
the atomic column density. For on resonant excitation on the
D2 line of Rb a column density of one atom per µm2 leads to
about 30% absorption. If the mean intensity of the incoming
beam is known, the main uncertainty is determined by mea-
suring the transmitted light. The signal-to-noise ratio for an
absorption measurement is

Equation (5) assumes that the mean incident photon ﬂux is
known to high precision. In absorption imaging it is common
practice to relate the absorption of the atoms to a reference
image by dividing the two images. Then the noise of the ref-
erence image has to be fully considered. For small absorp-
tion, the signal-to-noise ratio of Eq. (5) is reduced by a factor
1/√2. This increases the necessary minimum number of de-
tectable atoms by a factor √2.

To reach unity detection efﬁciency in absorption imaging it
seems natural to reduce the beam waist as much as possible as
indicated by Eq. (6). This is however not a successful strategy
as pointed out by van Enk [21, 22, 23]. A strongly focused
beam is not optimally overlapped with the radiation pattern of
the atoms. The absorption cross section for such a strongly
focused beam becomes smaller with a decreased spot size.

Another strategy to improve the sensitivity is to increase the
measurement time. The scattered photons will however heat
up the atoms and expel them from the observation window. If
the atom is held by a dipole trap, the measurement time can be
increased signiﬁcantly (See section IV A). There is no funda-
mental limit to the detection of a single atom via absorption,
if it can be kept localized long enough.

2. Refraction

≫

1) the absorption decreases as
For large detunings (∆
∆−2 as can be seen from Eq. (1). In addition the transmit-
∝
ted beam acquires a phase shift φatom. This is caused by the
refractive index of the atoms. The phase shift decreases only
∆−1 as shown by Eq. (2). The phase-shift has
with φatom
been used to image clouds of cold atoms and include Mach-
Zehnder type interferometers [24], for phase-contrast imaging
[25], or in line holography by defocussed imaging [26].

∝

The minimal detectable phase shift ∆φ in an interferometer
is given by the number / phase uncertainty relation ∆φ∆N =
1 resulting in ∆φmin = 1/√jinτ (neglecting absorption).
From these scaling laws for the scattered light and the phase
shift one ﬁnds for the signal-to-noise ratio for dispersive atom
detection:

reduced cavity mode waist can compensate for a small cavity
ﬁnesse [14].

When the cooperativity parameter is smaller than unity and
the atomic saturation is low, the signal-to-noise ratio for shot-
noise limited single atom detection becomes

surement time an increased signal-to-noise ratio can be ob-
tained by increasing the cooperativity parameter. This can be
done by increasing the cavity ﬁnesse, or by decreasing the
beam waist.

with Nscat = jinτ natσscat. SNRdisp depends only on the
total number of scattered photons Nscat. In fact it is the same
as for on resonant detection, and the optimal achievable SNR
for classical light as shown by Hope et al. [27, 28, 29]. Going
off resonance does not help in obtaining a better measurement
compared to plain absorption.

The off-resonant detection of atoms however has signiﬁcant
advantages in combination with cavities to enhance the inter-
action between photons and the atom [27]. Non-destructive
and shot noise limited detection becomes possible.

Similarly, the phase shift induced by the atom in the cavity
increases with the each round trip. Accordingly the signal to
noise ratio Eq. (7) is then increased to

C. Cavities

3. Many atoms in a cavity

Cavities enhance the interaction between the light and
atoms. The photons are given multiple chances to interact
with an atom located in the cavity. The number of interactions
is enhanced by increasing the number of round trips. The lat-
ter is determined by the cavity ﬁnesse nrt =
/2π. This can
be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratios. Even with mod-
erate ﬁnesse cavities single atom detection can be achieved.

The probability for absorption during each round trip is de-
termined by the ratio between the atomic absorption cross sec-

absorption is therefore

The above considerations concern the coupling of a sin-
gle atom to a cavity. This can be extended to the many-
atom case by introducing a many-atom cooperativity parame-
ter C = NeﬀC1, where Neﬀ is an effective number of atoms
in the cavity mode, which takes into account the spatial de-
pendence of the coupling constant g(~r) = g0ψ(~r), given by
the cavity mode function ψ(~r), and the atomic density distri-
bution ρ(~r). The fraction Neﬀ of the total atom number N ,
which are maximally coupled to the cavity mode, is given by
the overlap integral of both functions

becomes large as one approaches the concentric limit. A
large mirror spot size requires very uniform mirrors, as de-
viations from a spherical mirror shape will lower the optical
ﬁnesse drastically. Furthermore, as the concentric point is ap-
proached, the cavity also becomes extremely sensitive to mis-
alignments and vibrations. For more details on cavities see
Siegman [31].

E. Miniaturization

∝

The principle advantage of miniaturizing the cavities is that
for a ﬁxed geometry, i.e.
for a constant ratio of R and L,
the mode diameter scales with size (see Eqns. (12) and (13)).
This automatically increases the cooperativity parameter. In

with atoms localized inside the cavity as the light intensity
per photon increases. The interaction between the photon and

For detection of atoms the increased cooperativity param-
eter is the main beneﬁt from miniaturization. Miniaturized
cavities with moderate ﬁnesse can detect single atoms. There-
fore miniaturization is much more beneﬁcial for atom detec-
tion than for cavity QED experiments.

III. PROPERTIES OF FIBER CAVITIES

The advantage of ﬁbers is that they can be easily handled
using well established techniques. For instance, transfer mir-
ror coatings can be directly glued to the ﬁbers. Different ﬁbers
can be melted together using commercially available fusion
splicers. The fabrication of ﬁber optical components does usu-
ally not require expensive and time consuming lithographic
techniques. Fibers also have the advantage that they have very
low optical loss, usually less than 3 dB/km.

For miniaturization of optical components for atomic
physics several proposals on atom chip integration have been
presented [14, 16, 17, 32, 33, 34]. In our approach optical
ﬁbers are attached to the chip to form ﬁber-based cavities and
to make small dipole traps. For ﬁber cavity experiments it is
interesting to put atoms into the optical resonator. To place
the atom inside the cavity it is possible to cut the ﬁber into
two pieces and place the atom in the ﬁber gap. It is also pos-
sible to use a hollow ﬁber and guide the atom inside it [35].
Because it is quite difﬁcult to load atoms into a hollow ﬁber,
especially if it is mounted on a micro-structured surface, the
following section deals with ﬁber-gap-ﬁber conﬁgurations as
the ones outlined in Fig. 1.

One realization of a ﬁber cavity is to implant mirrors into
the ﬁbers, such as Bragg gratings or dielectric coatings in-
serted between ﬁber pieces. See Fig. 1a). This has the ad-
vantage that the interaction volume (the gap where the atoms
pass) is deﬁned only by the bare ﬁber tips. Thus only the ﬁber
itself has to be mounted on the atom chip with little or no need
for alignment actuators. Mirrors and tuning actuators can be
placed far from the gap. This allows a higher integration of
the optics. A disadvantage of this method is that the cavity
becomes quite long and that the extra interfaces increase the
optical loss of the cavity. Using a long cavity will increase the
mode volume and therefore also reduce g0. For atom detec-
tion the length of the cavity is fortunately not a very important
parameter, as indicated by Eq. (9).

creases the mismatch between the two modes. In this case the
loss also increases with the length of the ﬁber gap.

The quality of an optical resonator is described by its ﬁ-

nesse. The ﬁnesse is related to the losses by:

B. Losses due to the gap length

Figure 1: a) A cavity with implanted mirrors. This cavity requires
little alignment of the gap, but the mode volume is large. This con-
ﬁguration can be realized using only single mode ﬁbers. b) A plano-
concave cavity. Incoupling from a single mode ﬁber is efﬁcient, but
the mode diameter becomes large at the location of the atom. Out-
coupling to a single mode ﬁber is not optimal, but a multi-mode ﬁber
can collect the transmitted light well. c) A concave-concave cavity.
The mode diameter can be controlled, but coupling to single mode
ﬁbers is not optimal. d) Focussing optics can be integrated to op-
timize the ﬁber-cavity coupling efﬁciency. Cavities b) - d) require
active alignment of the gap.

where αi are the loss probabilities for the different loss chan-

1 the cav-
corresponds to α = 0.01. As long as Σiαi ≪
ity ﬁnesse is accurately calculated by Eq. (14). For further
details on resonators we again refer to [31]. For atom de-
tection it is desirable to obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio.
This does not automatically mean that the ﬁnesse should be
maximized. The signal-to-noise ratio for atom detection in
the weak coupling and low atomic saturation is given by
αT describes the mirror transmittance
Eq. (9), where κT ∝
and αtot = αT + αother is the total cavity loss. This im-
αT /(αT + αother)2 which is maximized
plies that SNR
for αT = αother. For each kind of cavity there is an optimal
choice for the mirror transmittance.

∝

When the cavity contains a gap (See Fig. 1a) the main loss
mechanism is related to the reduced coupling efﬁciency across
the gap. This loss depends mainly on three things. (1) It is
clear that the mode matching of the two ﬁbers is not optimal
and losses will occur as the gap is traversed. This loss in-
creases with the gap size. (2) Also, in the case of transverse
misalignment of the two ﬁbers modes are not well-matched
at the ﬁber facets. (3) A tilt between the two ﬁbers also in-

has a longitudinal displacement of z, a transversal displacement of
m and an angular misalignment of θ.

Figure 2 sketches these misalignments of the gap. The
power coupling efﬁciency η for two ﬁbers can be calculated
in the paraxial approximation by the overlap integral of the
involved transverse mode functions.

Here the transverse and angular misalignments are assumed
to be zero. A plot of a ﬁnesse measurement with varying gap
size z is shown in Fig. 9a. In this case mirrors with a loss of
1% are assumed to be located inside the ﬁbers. This loss is
decreased if the gap between the ﬁbers is small and the ﬁber
has a small numerical aperture i.e. a large w0. However, to
detect atoms w0 should be small, as indicated by Eq. (9).

If the two ﬁbers are transversally misaligned to each other
there will also be a mode mismatch when the light is coupled
between the ﬁbers. This loss can easily be calculated from
Eq. (15). Using normalized Gaussian mode functions for two
identical ﬁbers (with z = 0) with waist w0 choosing the gap
and angular misalignment to be zero one has

mirror cavity. The ﬁber mode diameter was w0 = 2.5 µm at
a wavelength of 780 nm. All losses except the gap losses were

which were normalized to θ0 and w0, respectively. θ0 is given by
λ/(πw0) = w0/z0. The different curves correspond to different gap
lengths starting with the highest ﬁnesse at z = 0 µm and ending with
the lowest at z = 10 µm. In b) the ﬁnesse is plotted as a function
of z/2z0. The different curves correspond to different β, where β is

depends quadratically on small misalignments.

E. Fresnel reﬂections

Another effect that has to be taken into account is the
reﬂection of light at the interfaces between the ﬁbers and
the introduced gap.
It results from the step in the refrac-
tive index and is called Fresnel reﬂection. For a typical
ﬁber (n1 = 1.5) in air or vacuum (n2 = 1) a fraction of
n1)2/(n2 + n1)2 = 4% of the incident light
RF = (n2
is reﬂected from a polished ﬂat connector. In the case of a
ﬁber gap cavity, these additional reﬂections lead to a system
of three coupled resonators. While for any system of coupled
resonators stationary solutions exist, i.e. eigenmodes of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, they will in general not be equidistantly
distributed in the frequency domain.

−

In a simple one-dimensional model, the coupled cavity sys-
tem can be treated as a chain of transfer matrices [31]. Figure
4 shows the calculated reﬂected and transmitted intensities for
a model resonator of rather low ﬁnesse.

The light intensity inside the gap depends on the speciﬁcs
of the mode. This changes the overall losses, as can be seen
in Fig. 4b. Consequently the reﬂected and transmitted inten-
sities vary from mode to mode. The effect is strongest when
the gap length is a multiple of λ/2. In experiments coupling
atoms to the light ﬁeld it has to be considered that the inten-
sity inside the gap depends on the order of the mode and on
the exact length of the gap. In absorption experiments only
the relative change of transmitted light intensity is measured,
which remains mode independent for light intensities well be-
low saturation. Never the less it leads to a mode dependent
signal-to noise ratio. Using ﬁbers with n=1.5 and intensities
below atomic saturation the SNR changes by roughly 15%

L1 6= L3 and L2 = λ/4 plus an integer multiple of λ/2. The pe-
riod of the envelope is given by the length difference of the two ﬁber
pieces.

IV. OTHER FIBER OPTICAL COMPONENTS FOR THE
ATOM CHIP

Not only cavities can be mounted on the surface of an atom
chip. Miniaturization offers various advantages for a couple of
other optical components. Lenses with extremely short focal
lengths can be used to focus light to small areas. Such devices
can be used to generate very tight dipole traps [37, 38, 39], or
to collect light from very well-deﬁned volumes [18].

A. Fluorescence and absorption detectors

A ﬂuorescence detector can be built using a single mode
tapered lensed ﬁber and a multi-mode ﬁber. In this case, the
tapered ﬁber is used to optically pump the atom. The multi
mode ﬁber is used to collect the ﬂuorescent light. For this con-
ﬁguration one can put the multi mode ﬁber at any angle with
respect to the tapered lensed ﬁber. At small angles, atoms lo-
cated in the focus of the tapered lensed ﬁber will scatter light
away from the multi mode ﬁber. This would constitute an ab-
sorption detector. Such a device is illustrated in Fig. 7c). If
the angle between the two ﬁbers is sufﬁciently large only the
ﬂuorescent emission from the atom will be collected by the
multi mode ﬁber. A picture of a 90◦ ﬂuorescence detector
setup is shown in Fig. 7b). If no atom is present in the beam
focus, very little light is scattered into the ﬁber. As soon as
an atom is present, this signal increases. For single atom de-
tection these two techniques are not sensitive enough, because

photon recoils will expel the atom from the detection region
and the multi mode ﬁber only collects a few photons. There-
fore one must also trap the atom(s) in the tapered lensed ﬁber
focus. This can be accomplished by a dipole trap.

B. A single mode tapered lensed ﬁber dipole trap

To increase the number of detectable photons, the atom can
be trapped inside the area where it interacts with the light.
One possibility is to hold the atom in place with a dipole trap.
An atom with transition frequency ω0 is attracted to the inten-
sity maximum of a red-detuned laser beam (ω < ω0). A fo-
cussed laser beam forms an atom trap in the beam focus. For a
far-detuned dipole trap quantities such as trap depth, lifetime
and number of scattered photons can be estimated easily. A
detailed derivation of dipole trap parameters discussed in the
following paragraph can be found in [40]. The potential depth
of a dipole trap is

where ∆D2 and ∆D1 are the detunings of the laser with re-
spect to the D2 and D1 lines of the alkali atom. The formulas
apply to alkali atoms with a laser detuning much larger than
the hyperﬁne structure splitting and a scattering rate far from
saturation. It follows that the scattering rate for a given po-
tential can be decreased by choosing a larger detuning and a
higher laser intensity. The potential depth scales as

whereas the scattering rate scales as

The D2 line of Rubidium, 2S1/2 →
2P1/2 has a wave-
length of 780 nm, and the D1 line 2S1/2 →
length of 795 nm. A standard tapered lensed ﬁber generates a
typical waist of w0 = 2.5 µm at a wavelength of 780 nm. Far
off resonance dipole traps can be realized with easy to use,
high power diode lasers at a wavelength of 808 nm. Standard
single mode lasers diodes are available with a power up to 150
mW. Assuming a coupling efﬁciency into the ﬁber of around
20%, one gets 30 mW of laser power in the dipole trap. These
parameters yield a trap depth of 3.9 mK, and a transverse (lon-
gitudinal) trap frequency of 80 kHz (6 kHz). The heating rate
for the dipole light is almost negligible. Experiments have
shown that the lifetime is mainly limited by the background
pressure of the vacuum chamber [41].

Using resonant light to detect an atom increases the number
of scattered photons as well as the heating rate enormously. In
this case the trap lifetime drops to below a millisecond, which
yields several thousands scattered photons before the atom is
lost.

A multi mode ﬁber as detector at a distance of 40 µm can
collect 2% of the ﬂuorescent emission (See Fig. 7b). Assum-
ing a detector efﬁciency of 60% (APD-based photon counter),
including additional losses in the rest of the optical detector

8

setup, it should be possible to detect about 100 photons dur-
ing the trap lifetime. The signal-to-noise ratio is difﬁcult to
calculate without knowing the background noise.

For an absorption detector, such as the one illustrated in
Fig. 7c, it is possible to use Eq. (5) to calculate the expected
signal-to-noise ratio. In this case one ﬁnds SNR=4 for τ =
100µs and Iin = 107 photons s−1µm−2.

V.

INTEGRATION OF FIBERS ON THE ATOM CHIP

A method for mounting ﬁbers accurately is needed to inte-
grate the above devices with atom chips. Fibers can be held
at the right place with the help of some kind of ﬁber grippers,
aligned and ﬁnally glued to the chip. This strategy will not
work well for ﬁber cavities because they need to be actively
aligned during operation (See Fig. 1b-d). For active alignment
of an on-chip cavity an actuator is needed. Useful actuators,
such as piezoelectric stacks, are quite large compared to the
ﬁbers. Typical dimensions exceed 2x2x2mm. This places re-
strictions on the level of optical integration one can obtain on
the chip. Components that don’t need active alignment, such
as the cavities with implanted mirrors (See Fig. 1a) or tapered
ﬁbers for dipole traps, can be directly integrated on the chip.
To obtain a high degree of precision in the mounting we have
developed a lithographic method where a thick photoresist is
patterned to form the mounting structures [34].

A. Building ﬁber cavities

We have so far realized cavities with curved and planar mir-
rors at the front-end of two ﬁbers, and cavities with implanted
mirrors made out of one piece of ﬁber with a gap for the atoms
similar to the ones shown in Fig. 1.

The mirror coatings are attached to the ﬁbers using a trans-
fer technique. In this process, dielectric mirror coatings with
a transmittance of 0.1% to 1% are manufactured on a glass
substrate. The substrate is either ﬂat or contains an array of
spherical microlenses for curved coatings. The adhesion be-
tween the coating and the glass substrate is fairly low. When
the coating is glued to an optical ﬁber it is possible to transfer
the coating from the substrate to the ﬁber [42]. A series of
pictures showing this transfer is found in Fig. 5.

The transmittance T is chosen to be around 1% for cavities
with implanted mirrors (Fig. 1a) because of the higher loss.
For the front-end mirrors (Fig. 1b-d), the loss is lower there-
fore it is more suitable to choose a mirror with transmittance
around 0.1% to obtain a high SNR for the detection of atoms.
The higher loss for cavities with implanted mirrors has
several origins in addition to the ones caused by the gap.
For some of our cavities the main intrinsic loss sources are
the glue layers holding the mirror coatings to the ﬁbers.
These glue layers are typically a few micrometers thick. The
transversal conﬁnement of the ﬁber is absent in the glue layers
as well as in the mirror coatings. This leads to losses similar
to the ones discussed for the gap length, i.e Eq. (18). Glued

inserting two planar mirrors into a ﬁber with length about 10
cm. This ﬁber cavity is subsequently cut into two halves and
the new surfaces are polished. This cavity has the advantage
that it is very easy to align and mount. An actual cavity of
this kind is shown in Fig. 7d) where the cavity is mounted
on an atom chip using a SU-8 structure to hold the ﬁbers. The
drawback with this cavity geometry is that the ﬁnesse is rather
low compared to the front-end mirrors, mainly because of the
ﬁber gap and the glue layers as described above. Cavities with
inserted mirrors typically reach a ﬁnesse of a few hundred
instead of a few thousand as for the front-end cavities. The
losses due to the glue layers could be reduced by direct coat-
ing of the ﬁber instead of using the transfer technique. The
losses due to the gap itself could also be reduced by introduc-
ing collimation optics in the gap, such as a small grin lens
or a tapered ﬁber. Such additional optics will however intro-
duce additional Fresnel reﬂections and may also require active
alignment of the gap, as for the front-end cavity.

mirrors are also sensitive to angular misalignment, which can
be treated by Eq. (25).

Figure 5: Picture a) shows a ﬁber with a drop of glue on the tip.
The ﬁber is hovering 100 microns above a micro lens with dielectric
mirror coating. The lower part is a mirror image of the real ﬁber.
Once the ﬁber is glued to the coating it can be removed by gently
pulling the ﬁber away from the substrate. In picture b) one can see
the micro lens array from above. A closer look reveals that coatings
are missing from two of the lenses. One of these is attached to the
ﬁber shown in c). Additionally in c) light was coupled in from the
other side of the ﬁber, so one can see the ﬁber core in the center of
the picture.

Curved coatings may be used to build a concave cavity with
front-end mirrors. With this design we reached a ﬁnesse of
greater than 1000 as shown in Fig. 6. Complications due to
Fresnel reﬂections do not exist for the front-end cavity. The
quality of the mirrors and their alignment determine how high
the ﬁnesse may become. The mode proﬁle of the optical ﬁber
does usually not match the cavity mode. This leads to a poor
incoupling into the front-end cavity. This problem can be
solved by transferring the mirror coatings to a tapered ﬁber, or
a small grin lens to focus the light into the cavity mode. This
unfortunately leads to a more complicated and error prone fab-
rication process. In addition, a cavity with front-end mirrors
must be mounted on alignment actuators for efﬁcient tuning
of the cavity. This makes miniaturization and integration of
multiple cavities harder.

Figure 6: Finesse measurement of a cavity with a ﬂat mirror on a
single mode ﬁber on the incoupling side and a curved mirror with
r = 350 µm on a multimode ﬁber on the outcoupling side, as the one
illustrated in Fig. 1b. Both mirrors have an reﬂectance of R=99.9%.
The ﬁnesse stays above 400 for ﬁber separations smaller than 200
µm and has a maximal value of 1200 for small mirror separations.

A cavity with the geometry shown in Fig. 1a) was built by

substrate was varied between 20 °C and 70 °C. The ﬁnesse
of the inserted ﬁber resonator showed no change during heat-
ing. Another test for the quality of the SU-8 structures was

10

To mount ﬁbers on the atom chip a lithographically pat-
terned photoresist called SU-8 was used. SU-8 is an epoxy
based negative resist with high mechanical, chemical and ther-
mal stability. Its speciﬁc properties facilitate the production
of thick structures with very smooth, nearly vertical sidewalls
[34]. It has been used to fabricate various micro-components.
Examples include optical planar waveguides with high ther-
mal stability and controllable optical properties. Mechanical
parts such as microgears [43] for engineering applications,
and microﬂuidic systems for chemistry [44] have also been
built. The SU-8 is typically patterned with 365-436 nm UV-
light.

To assess the quality of the alignment structures, we use
the SU-8 structures to hold ﬁber optical resonators. The ﬁ-
nesse of the resonator strongly depends on losses introduced
by misalignment as described by Eq. (26). The layout of the
used alignment structure with ﬁbers is shown in Fig. 8. This
design includes funnels to simplify assembly. To avoid an-
gular misalignment the total length of the alignment structure
is quite long (6000 µm). The structure is divided into several
subsegments to reduce stress induced by thermal expansion.

a ﬁnesse measurement as a function of gap size. One mea-
surement was done in the SU-8 structures and one outside
the structures. The measurement outside was performed with
nanopositioning stages, which in principle can be tuned to a
few nanometers. With the positioning stages the ﬁnesse was
optimized. Nevertheless, the ﬁnesse obtained inside the SU-8

structures always remained higher than the ones obtained us-
ing the positioning stages. The results of these measurements
are shown in Fig. 9a). The structures have also allowed long-
term stability of the cavities in a high-vacuum environment.

VI. PILOT TEST FOR ATOM DETECTION WITH SMALL
WAISTS

To assess the consequences of Eq. (9) a test using a macro-
scopic cavity was performed [45]. The goal was to detect
atoms with a cavity with moderate ﬁnesse and a very small
mode diameter.

A. Dropping atoms through a concentric cavity

To explore atom detection using cavities with small waists,
we built a magneto-optical trap (MOT) for 85Rb atoms ap-
proximately 20 mm above the center of a near concentric
cavity with a ﬁnesse of about 1100 formed by normal high-
107 atoms at a
reﬂectance mirrors. The MOT contained
temperature of 35 µK. In a ﬁrst experiment, we switched off
the trap completely and monitored the atomic cloud as it fell
freely through the cavity. This conﬁguration was used to esti-
mate the detection sensitivity of the cavity.

∼

Figure 10: a) The ﬁnesse of the cavity decreases as the concentric
point is approached. The curve is calculated from the cavity geome-
try and mirror speciﬁcations. b) Schematic description of the cavity
and the magnetic guide mounted next to the cavity.

We measured the light intensity transmitted through the
cavity with an ampliﬁed photodiode for high light intensities
or with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) for low light intensities.

11

The PMT provided a near shot-noise limited detection. The
low-noise electronic ampliﬁcation limited the detection band-
width to 20 kHz. The main source of technical noise in our
setup was due to mechanical vibrations of the vacuum cham-
ber that held the cavity.

To minimize the inﬂuence of vibrations and long term drifts
one of the cavity mirrors was mounted on a piezoelectric tri-
pod that allowed us to keep the TEM00 mode centered on the
cavity axis. The second mirror was mounted on a translating
piezoelectric stage for wavelength stabilization. Figure 10 il-
lustrates how the cavity ﬁnesse was reduced as the concentric
point was approached for our cavity formed by two mirrors
with a radius of curvature of R = 10 mm and a transmittance
T = 10−3. For a mirror separation far less than the concen-
tric limit the cavity had a ﬁnesse of 3000. The ﬁnesse dropped
to 1100 when the separation was 70 µm from the concentric
point. The cavity mode waist was 12.1 µm for this separation.

×

The drop in the cavity transmission signal from freely
falling atoms is plotted in Fig. 11a). The different curves
show different pump powers, corresponding to empty cavity
transmissions between 1 pW and 600 pW. The atom number
107, the signal drops by 90% as long
in the MOT is 1.5
as the atomic transition is not saturated (Fig. 11b). Combin-
ing the results of [14] with Eq. 11 the effective atom number
becomes Neﬀ = 2.5
0.5. This was consistent with an in-
dependent atom number measurement based on ﬂuorescence
imaging. To determine the sensitivity limit of the cavity detec-
tor, the number of atoms in the MOT was gradually reduced
105 atoms. This atom number
until the MOT contained 3.5
×
produced a signal drop of approximately 10%. We consider
this to be the sensitivity limit. A theoretical ﬁt results in an
effective atom number sensitivity of Neﬀ = 0.1

0.05.

B. Detecting Magnetically Guided Atoms

As a next step, atoms were magnetically guided to the cav-
ity center using a wire guide [46]. By changing the current in
the guiding wire the overlap between the atoms and the cavity
mode could be adjusted. In Fig. 12 we plot the cavity trans-
mission as the position of the magnetic guide is varied across
the cavity mode. As the atomic overlap with the cavity mode
was increased, we observed an increased drop in cavity trans-
mission. From the duration of the drop in transmission the
temperature of the guided atoms could be determined to be 25
µK. The density distribution for the atoms was much larger
than the Rayleigh volume of the cavity. Consequently, it was
not possible to distinguish individual atoms in the guide using
our cavity. This cavity would show a detectable change in the
transmission signal if a single atom crossed the region of max-
imum coupling as Neﬀ can be as small as 0.1. The precision
in the positioning can be improved using magnetic microtraps
produced by atom chip surface traps [1]. To achieve the same
detection sensitivity with a cavity mode diameter of 2 µm a
ﬁnesse of 40 would be sufﬁcient.

12

VII. CONCLUSION

In this article we have explored and compared various
methods of detecting single atoms on an atom chip. Minia-
turization brings advantages for such detectors. To detect
atoms with a cavity, the requirements on the cavity ﬁnesse
relaxes quadratically as the mode diameter of the cavity is de-
creased. This favorable scaling law was tested in a pilot exper-
iment where atoms were detected when magnetically guided
through a near-concentric cavity

The simplest way to get to a fully integrated atom detec-
tor on an atom chip is to mount optical ﬁbers on to the sur-
face of the chip. Such ﬁber devices can be used for ﬂu-
orescence, absorption, and cavity assisted detection of sin-
gle atoms. To integrate ﬁbers, we have developed a precise
lithographic method that allows robust positioning of ﬁbers to
within ¡150 nanometers. The high accuracy allows very re-
liable ﬁber-to-ﬁber coupling, suitable for integration of ﬁber
cavities (Fig. 1a). We have built and integrated a ﬁber cavity
on an atom chip which should be able to detect a single atom
with a SNR of better the 5 within a measurement time of 10
µs. The same lithographic method has been used to position
tapered lensed ﬁbers on the chip. These can be used to com-
bine dipole traps and ﬂuorescence/absorption detectors.

Figure 11: (a) Cavity transmission signal for atoms dropped from
a MOT. Different curves correspond to different cavity pump pow-
ers. The signal has been averaged over 2.5ms for better visualiza-
tion. (b) Relative drop of the signal due to the atoms in (a). The
circles (squares) come from measurements with a PMT (photodiode)
for different light intensities. The black line is calculated numeri-
cally.

Figure 12: Cavity transmission signal from atoms being magneti-
cally guided through the cavity mode. The position of the potential
minimum is linearly dependent on the wire current.

Double resonance frequency shift in a hydrogen maser

M.A. Humphrey, D.F. Phillips and R.L. Walsworth

Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA 02138

(February 2, 2008)

We use the dressed atom formalism to calculate the frequency shift in a hydrogen maser induced
by applied radiation near the Zeeman frequency, and ﬁnd excellent agreement with a previous
calculation made in the bare atom basis. The maser oscillates on the ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne
transition, while the applied ﬁeld is swept through the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman resonance. We
determine the eﬀect of the applied ﬁeld on the Zeeman levels using the dressed atom picture, and
then calculate the maser frequency shift by coupling the dressed states to the microwave cavity.
Qualitatively, the dressed-atom analysis gives a new and simpler physical interpretation of this
double resonance process, which has applications in precision hydrogen Zeeman spectroscopy, e.g.,
in fundamental symmetry tests.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since its development nearly 40 years ago, the hydrogen maser has served as a robust tool capable of making high
precision measurements by utilizing its excellent frequency stability [1–3]. Hydrogen masers are currently the most
stable active oscillators over intervals of seconds to days, with applications including very long baseline interferometry,
deep space tracking and navigation, and metrology. In addition, hydrogen masers have been used to make precision
atomic physics measurements [4–8] and for sensitive tests of general relativity [9] and quantum mechanics [10,11].

A hydrogen maser operates on the ﬁrst-order magnetic ﬁeld-independent ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne transition,
between states |2i and |4i of the electronic ground state (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, atoms in states |1i and |2i are
injected into a storage bulb residing in a microwave cavity tuned near the hyperﬁne frequency, creating the population
inversion necessary for active maser oscillation. The microwave ﬁeld stimulates a small, coherent magnetization in
the atomic ensemble, and this magnetization acts as a source to increase the microwave ﬁeld. With suﬃciently high
atomic ﬂux and low cavity losses, this feedback induces active maser oscillation. The maser frequency is very stable;
a well engineered hydrogen maser can have fractional frequency stability on the order of 1×10−15 over intervals of a
few hours.
Hydrogen masers can also be used as sensitive probes of the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman resonances through
a double resonance technique [12], in which an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld tuned near the atomic Zeeman resonance
shifts the ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 maser frequency. At low static magnetic ﬁelds, this maser frequency shift is an
antisymmetric function of the detuning of the applied oscillating ﬁeld from the Zeeman resonance. Thus, by observing
the antisymmetric pulling of the otherwise stable maser frequency, the hydrogen Zeeman frequency can be determined
with high precision.

An early investigation of atomic double resonance was made by Ramsey [13], who calculated the frequency shift
between two levels coupled by radiation to other levels. This calculation treated the problem perturbatively to ﬁrst
order in the coupling ﬁeld strength, and it neglected damping. Later, Andresen [12,14] calculated the frequency shift
in a hydrogen maser due to an applied ﬁeld oscillating near the F = 1 Zeeman frequency (see Sec. II), and then
measured this double resonance eﬀect using a hydrogen maser, ﬁnding reasonable agreement with the calculation.
Andresen’s calculation employed a bare atom basis, treating the problem to second order in the applied ﬁeld strength
and including phenomenological damping terms, but used an oversimpliﬁed description of spin-exchange relaxation.
Savard [15] revisited the problem with a more realistic spin-exchange relaxation description [16], and found a small
correction to the earlier work.

Although the work of Andresen and Savard provides a complete description for the double resonance maser frequency
shift, intuitive understanding is obscured by the length of the calculations and the use of the bare atom basis.
In particular, these works demonstrate that the amplitude of the antisymmetric maser frequency shift is directly
proportional to the electronic polarization of the masing atomic ensemble. The maser frequency shift vanishes as this
polarization goes to zero. The previous bare atom analyses provide no physical interpretation of ths eﬀect.

Since the dressed atom formalism [17] often adds physical insight to the understanding of the interaction of matter
and radiation, we apply it here to the double resonance frequency shift in a hydrogen maser. In a two step process, we
ﬁrst use the dressed atom picture to determine the eﬀect of the applied Zeeman radiation on the atomic states. Then,
we analyze the eﬀect of the microwave cavity ﬁeld on the dressed states and determine the maser frequency shift.
We ﬁnd excellent quantitative agreement between the dressed atom calculation and the previous bare atom result.
We exploit the dressed atom calculation to oﬀer a simple physical interpretation of the double resonance hydrogen
maser frequency shift, including a straightforward explanation of the polarization dependence. We conclude by noting
the experimental application of the double resonance eﬀect to perform improved, high precision hydrogen Zeeman
spectroscopy.

II. MASER OSCILLATION FREQUENCY

In a hydrogen maser (Fig. 2), molecular hydrogen is dissociated in an rf discharge and a thermal beam of hydrogen
atoms is formed. A hexapole state selecting magnet focuses the higher energy, low-ﬁeld-seeking hyperﬁne states (|1i
and |2i) into a quartz maser bulb at about 1012 atoms/sec. Inside the bulb (volume ≈ 103 cm3), the atoms travel
ballistically for about 1 second before escaping, making ≈ 104 collisions with the bulb wall. A Teﬂon coating reduces
the atom-wall interaction and thus inhibits decoherence of the masing atomic ensemble by wall collisions. The maser
bulb is centered inside a cylindrical TE011 microwave cavity resonant with the 1420 MHz hyperﬁne transition. As
described above, the microwave ﬁeld and atomic ensemble form a coupled system with positive feedback that will
actively oscillate near the ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne frequency if there is a suﬃciently high atomic ﬂux into the
maser bulb. Since the atoms are conﬁned to a region of uniform microwave ﬁeld phase, their velocity is eﬀectively
averaged to zero over the interaction time with the microwave ﬁeld, and ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀects are eliminated. The
maser signal is inductively coupled out of the microwave cavity and ampliﬁed with an external receiver. Surrounding
the cavity, a solenoid produces a weak static magnetic ﬁeld to maintain the quantization axis inside the maser bulb, and
a pair of Helmholtz coils produces the oscillating transverse magnetic ﬁeld that drives the F = 1 Zeeman transitions.
The cavity, solenoid, and Zeeman drive coils are all enclosed within several layers of magnetic shielding.

To calculate the maser oscillation frequency, we ﬁrst determine the relationship between the microwave ﬁeld and
a source magnetization. If we assume that a single cavity mode is dominant within the microwave cavity, we may
write the microwave magnetic ﬁeld as H(r, ω) = √4πpC(ω)HC(r), where pC characterizes the frequency- (i.e. time-
) dependent amplitude and HC represents the time-independent spatial variation of the mode. A straightforward
application of Maxwell’s equations relates pC (ω) to a source magnetization M(ω):

(ω2

iωCω

QC − ω2)pC (ω) = √4πω2hH (z)

C ibVbM (ω)

(1)

where ω is the maser frequency, ωC is the cavity frequency, hH (z)
C ib is the average of the microwave ﬁeld’s z-component
over the bulb, and Vb is the volume of the maser bulb. The second term on the left has been introduced phenomeno-
logically to account for cavity losses characterized by QC, the cavity quality factor. The source magnetization is
produced by the atomic ensemble, and is given by the expectation value of the magnetic dipole operator (neglecting
the term precessing at −ω),

M (ω) = N hˆµi = N T r(ˆρˆµ) = N µ24ρ42(ω)

(2)

where N is the atomic density and µ24 is the hyperﬁne transition dipole matrix element, µ24 ≈ −µB. The atomic
coherence ρ42(ω) is found by solving the Bloch equations

˙ρ =

in steady state. The unperturbed Hamiltonian, H0, includes only the atomic state energies (given by the hyperﬁne
and Zeeman interactions), and the interaction Hamiltonian, Hint, describes the eﬀect of the microwave cavity ﬁeld,
which couples states |2i and |4i. For perfect hexapole state selection, the ﬂux term is written

˙ρf lux =

(|1ih1| + |2ih2|) − rρ,

(4)

where the positive terms account for the injection of atoms in states |1i and |2i at rate r, and the last term accounts
for bulb escape. The relaxation term, ˙ρrelax, phenomenologically describes population and coherence relaxation due
to wall collisions, magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneities, and spin-exchange collisions.

In the absence of Zeeman radiation and for small detuning of the cavity from the |2i ↔ |4i hyperﬁne transition

frequency, ω24, the maser frequency is found using Eqns. 1 - 3 to be

ω = ω24 +

QC
Ql

(ωC − ω24)

(5)

where Ql = ω24/∆ω, the atomic line-Q, is on the order of 109 [1]. Since the cavity-Q is on the order of 104, the cavity
pulling is highly suppressed, and the maser oscillates near the atomic hyperﬁne frequency, ω24.

In the presence of Zeeman radiation, the maser frequency is shifted, as ﬁrst shown by Andresen [12] and measured
anew here (see Fig. 3). His calculation of the double resonance shift included the applied Zeeman ﬁeld in the
interaction Hamiltonian but otherwise left unchanged the above analysis for the maser frequency. To second order in
the Rabi frequency of the applied Zeeman ﬁeld, |X12|, and in terms of the unperturbed maser Rabi frequency |X 0
24|,
atom ﬂow rate r, population decay rate γ1, hyperﬁne decoherence rate γ2, and Zeeman decoherence rate γZ, the small
static ﬁeld limit of the maser shift is given by [18]

where δ is the detuning of the applied ﬁeld from the atomic Zeeman frequency, and ρ0
33 = r/(2γ1) is the steady
state population diﬀerence between states |1i and |3i in the absence of an applied Zeeman ﬁeld (following Eqn. 8 of
ref. [12]). Physically, the population diﬀerence between states |1i and |3i represents the electronic polarization of the
hydrogen ensemble [14]:

(7)

Equation 6 implies that a steady state electronic polarization, and hence a population diﬀerence between states |1i
and |3i injected into the maser bulb, is a necessary condition for the maser to exhibit a double resonance frequency
shift. Walsworth et. al. demonstrated this polarization dependence experimentally by operating a hydrogen maser in
three conﬁgurations: (i) with the usual input ﬂux of atoms in states |1i and |2i; (ii) with a pure input ﬂux of atoms
in state |2i, where the maser frequency shift vanishes; and (iii) with an input beam of atoms in states |2i and |3i,
where the maser shift is inverted [7].
For typical applied Zeeman ﬁeld strengths, the 1420 MHz maser frequency is shifted tens of mHz (see Fig. 3), a
fractional shift of ≈ 10−11. However, the shift is easily resolved because of the excellent fractional maser frequency
stability (parts in 1015).

III. DRESSED ATOM CALCULATION

We now consider an alternative approach to calculating the double resonance maser frequency shift using the dressed
atom picture. We retain the Maxwell-Bloch formalism of Eqns. 1 - 3; however we determine the steady state coherence
ρ42(ω) in a dressed atom basis, including the atomic state energies, the applied Zeeman ﬁeld, and the atom/Zeeman
ﬁeld interaction. For simplicity, we assume the static magnetic ﬁeld is suﬃciently low that the two F = 1, ∆mF = ±1
Zeeman frequencies are nearly degenerate, ω12 − ω23 ≪ γZ , as is the case for typical hydrogen maser operation. We
use the simpliﬁed spin-exchange relaxation model [12] and neglect the small spin-exchange correction to the double
resonance maser frequency shift [15].

A. Dressed atom basis

By incorporating the applied Zeeman ﬁeld into the unperturbed Hamiltonian, it takes the form H0 = Ha +Hf +Vaf .
The atomic states (deﬁning state |2i as energy zero) are described by Ha = ¯hω12|1ih1| − ¯hω23|3ih3| − ¯hω24|4ih4|; the
applied Zeeman ﬁeld (at frequency ωZ ) is described by Hf = ¯hωZa†a; and the interaction between them is given by

Here, the Zeeman ﬁeld creation and annihilation operators are a† and a, h.c. denotes Hermitian conjugate, and g is
the single-photon Rabi frequency for the Zeeman transitions. We will use eigenkets with two indices to account for

Vaf = ¯hg(cid:0)a + a†(cid:1) [|1ih2| + |2ih3| + h.c.] .

the atomic state and the number of photons in the Zeeman ﬁeld, denoted by n. We select four of these as our bare
atom/Zeeman ﬁeld basis, {|1, n − 1i,|2, ni,|3, n + 1i,|4, ni}, where the ﬁrst entry indicates the atomic state and the
second entry indicates the Zeeman photon number. We note that for a resonant ﬁeld, ωZ = ω12, the ﬁrst three basis
states are degenerate. Also, n ≫ 1 in practice for there to be any measureable double resonance maser frequency
shift.

In this bare atom/Zeeman ﬁeld basis, the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator takes the following matrix form:

deﬁne the Zeeman ﬁeld Rabi frequency (the factor of two has been inserted to be consistent with our rotating wave
approximation convention; see note [18]). By diagonalizing H0, we ﬁnd new basis states which physically represent
the atomic states dressed by the applied Zeeman ﬁeld. The dressed energy levels are the eigenvalues of H0: Ea = ¯hΩ,
12 represents the generalized Rabi frequency. The dressed

Eb = 0, Ec = −¯hΩ, and E4 = −¯hω24, where Ω = qδ2 + 1

Note that in the limit of large negative δ, |ai → |1i and |ci → |3i, while in the limit of large positive δ, |ai → |3i and
|ci → |1i. This will become important in the physical interpretation of the maser frequency shift (see Sec. IV).
An operator ˆO transforms between bare atom to dressed atom bases as ˆOd = T −1 ˆObT , where T is the unitary
matrix linking the dressed atom and bare atom basis states (coeﬃcients of Eqn. 11). The dressed and bare atom
energies and eigenvectors are equivalent for the F = 0 hyperﬁne state |4i because this state is unaﬀected by the
applied Zeeman ﬁeld.

B. Dressed basis Bloch equations

We now couple the dressed states to the microwave cavity using the Bloch equations, which remain of the form

˙ρd =

(12)

The unperturbed Hamiltonian, H0, now accounts for the bare atom energies and the applied Zeeman driving ﬁeld,
while the microwave cavity ﬁeld is included in the interaction Hamiltonian, Hint. Since the dressed states |ai,|bi, and
|ci all have a component of the atomic state |2i (see Eqn. 11), the microwave ﬁeld couples state |4i to each:

(13)

Note that H24 = h2|ˆµ · HC|4i is the only nonzero coupling between bare atom states supported by the TE011 mode
microwave cavity. To transform the relaxation terms into the dressed basis, we make the approximation that all
relaxation rates (population decay γ1, hyperﬁne decoherence γ2, and Zeeman decoherence γZ) have the same value,
γ + r (γ includes all relaxation exclusive of bulb loss). Typically, these rates are within a factor of two (see the values
listed in Fig. 3). Then,

(14)

In the bare atom basis, the ﬂux term has a very simple form (Eqn. 4) with no oﬀ-diagonal input entries since the
injected beam has no coherence between the bare atomic states. In the dressed basis, however, there is an injected
Zeeman coherence, so the ﬂux term takes a considerably more complicated form

˙ρd
f lux =

(15)

where F d = T −1 (|1ih1| + |2ih2|) T has three diagonal and six oﬀ-diagonal entries.

The Bloch equations are most easily handled by moving to the interaction picture, given by ˆO = e−i ˆH0t/¯h ˜ˆO ei ˆH0t/¯h,

where

˜ˆO is an interaction picture operator.

C. Steady state solution

The 4×4 matrix equation (12) yields sixteen independent equations that we solve in the steady state. Then,
the populations in the interaction picture are static, ˙˜ρνν = 0, and the coherences exhibit sinusoidal precession. In
particular, ˜ρ4a = R4ae−i(Ω−∆)t, ˜ρ4b = R4bei∆t, and ˜ρ4c = R4cei(Ω+∆)t, where the Rµν are time independent, and
∆ = ω−ω24. The other coherences precess at frequencies ωµν = (Eµ−Eν)/¯h. Making these steady state substitutions,
the sixteen Bloch diﬀerential equations transform to a set of time-independent algebraic equations. We assume that
ωC = ω24, so that the small cavity pulling shift vanishes. The total maser frequency shift is then given by ∆.

In terms of dressed basis density matrix elements (rotated out of the interaction picture), the atomic coherence

ρ42(ω) is given by

(18)

Here VC is the cavity volume and η is a dimensionless ﬁlling factor [1,2].

We numerically solve the time-independent algebraic system of sixteen Bloch equations plus equations (17) to
determine the maser frequency shift ∆ as a function of Zeeman detuning δ. We ﬁnd excellent agreement with the
previous theoretical bare atom analysis [12], within the approximation of equal population decay and decoherence
rates. (Note that in practice, these decay rates diﬀer by up to a factor of two).

IV. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION

The dressed state analysis provides a straightforward physical interpretation of the double resonance maser fre-
quency shift. In the absence of the applied Zeeman ﬁeld, atoms injected in bare state |2i are the sole source of the
magnetization that provides the positive feedback needed for active oscillation. However, when the near-resonant
Zeeman ﬁeld is applied, it also allows atoms injected in the mF = ± 1 states (bare states |1i and |3i) to contribute
via a two-photon process. A dressed atom interpretation shows how these mF = ± 1 state atoms can become the
dominant source of maser magnetization as the applied Zeeman ﬁeld nears resonance.

5

4a and H 2

Viewed from the dressed atom basis, three factors contribute to this interpretation. First, as shown in Fig. 4(a),
the applied Zeeman ﬁeld shifts the energies of the two dressed levels |ai and |ci symmetrically relative to level |bi,
4b = h4|ˆµ · HC|bi2
which remains unperturbed. Second, near the Zeeman resonance, the ∆F = 1 dipole coupling H 2
vanishes while H 2
4c become equally dominant, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Third, below resonance (δ < 0) the
steady state population of state |ai is greater than that of state |ci (ρaa > ρcc), while above resonance (δ > 0) the
opposite is true (ρcc > ρaa), as shown in Fig. 4(c). These dressed state population diﬀerences arise from the fact that
atoms in bare state |1i are injected into the maser while those in bare state |3i are not, under normal operation, so
in the steady state ρ11 > ρ33. For large negative Zeeman detunings, |ai → |1i and |ci → |3i (see discussion following
Eqn. 11). The opposite holds for positive detuning, where |ai → |3i and |ci → |1i.
These three ingredients combine to create the double resonance shift of the maser frequency, shown in Fig. 4(d).
For small negative Zeeman detunings (|δ| < 2γZ), the excess of ρaa over ρcc and the relatively small size of H 2
4b leads
to maser oscillation primarily on the |ai ↔ |4i transition. That is, atoms injected into the maser cavity in the bare
state |1i contribute signiﬁcantly to the maser oscillation via a two-photon process: one Zeeman transition photon and
one microwave photon within the resonant cavity linewidth. This |ai ↔ |4i transition is at a slightly higher frequency
than in the unperturbed (no applied ﬁeld) maser, so the maser frequency is increased. Conversely, for small positive
Zeeman detunings (δ < 2γZ), the maser oscillates preferentially on the |ci ↔ |4i transition, and the maser frequency
is decreased. For larger Zeeman detunings (positive or negative), the coupling of state |4i to unshifted dressed state
|bi becomes dominant, and the magnitude of the frequency shift is reduced. For zero Zeeman detuning, dressed states
|ai and |ci are equally populated in the steady state and the maser frequency shift exactly vanishes.
Injection of an electronic polarization into the maser bulb is needed for the applied Zeeman ﬁeld to induce a maser
frequency shift. Since ωa and ωc are spaced equally about the unperturbed maser frequency ωb, and since H 2
4a = H 2
4c,
a necessary condition for a maser shift is a diﬀerence in the steady state values of ρaa and ρcc, which is a direct
consequence of a diﬀerence in the injected populations of bare states |1i and |3i, i.e., a net electronic polarization.

V. APPLICATION

The double resonance hydrogen maser technique was originally studied for use in autotuning the maser cavity [12].
In addition to the double resonance frequency shift, there is a cavity pulling shift for a mistuned maser cavity, with
magnitude dependent on the linewidth of the hyperﬁne transitions, through the line-Q (see Eqn. 5). The applied
Zeeman radiation depletes the population of bare state |2i, thereby increasing the linewidth of the hyperﬁne transition.
Andresen [12] showed that the cavity can be tuned to the atomic frequency by modulating the hyperﬁne linewidth
with applied Zeeman radiation and adjusting the cavity frequency such that there is no modulation of the maser
frequency. However, this method requires accurate setting of the applied Zeeman ﬁeld to the Zeeman resonance (i.e.
δ = 0).

The double resonance technique can also be used for precision Zeeman spectroscopy in a hydrogen maser. Tra-
ditionally, the Zeeman frequency in a hydrogen maser operating at low magnetic ﬁelds is measured by sweeping an
audio frequency ﬁeld through the Zeeman resonance and monitoring the maser power. The power is diminished near
resonance with a Lorentzian shape with a width on the order of 1 Hz. Typical resolution of the Zeeman frequency
with this technique is about 100 mHz. However, by utilizing the sharp, antisymmetric proﬁle of the double resonance
frequency shift, we were able to determine the hydrogen Zeeman frequency with a resolution of about 1 mHz. Recently
we used this double resonance technique in a search for Lorentz symmetry violation of the hydrogen atom’s electron
and proton spin [19], motivated by a general extension of the standard model of elementary particle physics [20].

VI. CONCLUSION

We used the dressed atom formalism to calculate the frequency shift of a hydrogen maser induced by an applied
ﬁeld near the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman transition frequency. The result is in excellent quantitative agreement with
previous bare atom basis calculations [12,15], within a simpliﬁed spin-exchange approximation and with equal decay
rates for all populations and coherences. The dressed atom picture provides a simple physical understanding of the
double resonance frequency shift, and in particular, the atomic polarization dependence of the frequency shift. The
double resonance technique can be employed in precision spectroscopy of the hydrogen Zeeman frequency, e.g. in a
test of Lorentz symmetry of the standard model [19,20].

FIG. 1. Hydrogen hyperﬁne structure. A hydrogen maser oscillates on the ﬁrst-order magnetic ﬁeld-independent |2i ↔ |4i
hyperﬁne transition near 1420 MHz. The maser typically operates with a static ﬁeld less than 1 mG. For these low ﬁeld
strengths, the two F = 1, ∆mF = 1 Zeeman frequencies are nearly degenerate, and ν12 ≈ ν23 ≈ 1 kHz.

FIG. 3. Double resonance maser frequency shifts. The large open circles are data taken with an input beam of |1i and |2i
hydrogen atoms. These are compared with Eqn. 6 (full curve) using the parameter values shown. The values of |X12| and
γZ were chosen to ﬁt the data, while the remaining parameters were independently measured. The experimental error of each
measurement is smaller than the circle marking it. The electronic polarization dependence of the double resonance eﬀect is
illustrated with the dotted data points: with an input beam of |2i and |3i atoms, the shift is inverted. Note that the maser
frequency shifts for the dotted points were scaled up by a factor of 10 since these data were acquired with a much weaker
applied Zeeman ﬁeld. The large variation of the maser frequency shift with Zeeman detuning near resonance, along with the
excellent maser frequency stability, allows the Zeeman frequency (≈ 800 Hz) to be determined to about 3 mHz in a single scan
of the double resonance such as the dotted data shown here (requiring ≈ 20 minutes of data acquisition).

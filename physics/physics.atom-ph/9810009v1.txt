Abstract

The possibility of electron attachment to the valence 3Π state of CO is exam-
ined using an ab initio bound-state multireference conﬁguration interaction
approach. The resulting resonance has 4Σ− symmetry; the higher vibrational
levels of this resonance state coincide with, or are nearly coincident with, lev-
els of the parent a3Π state. Collisional relaxation to the lowest vibrational
levels in hot plasma situations might yield the possibility of a long-lived CO−
state.

Negatively-charged atoms and molecules have been extensively studied over the decades
[1]. However, developments of new experimental and theoretical methodologies have initiated
a resurgence of interest [2] in small anionic species such as N −
[3,4]. We report
here the results of a theoretical study of CO− anions that seeks to address two issues: (i) the
long-pending characterization of a “dipole-dominated resonance” observed 25 years ago in
e-CO scattering by Wong and Schulz [5], and (ii) rationalization of very recent observations
of metastable CO− in mass spectrometric probes of transient plasmas produced in sputtering
[6] and in interactions of molecules with intense laser ﬁelds [7].

Resonances, or compound negative-ion states, play an important role in electron-molecule
scattering [8]. They are identiﬁed as discrete metastable states of a molecule+electron that
are embedded in, and interact with, a continuum of scattering states. Therefore, they have
short lifetimes (in the range 10−14s - 10−12s) against decay by electron ejection, via diﬀerent
pathways, to a neutral state. Such decay often results in the neutral molecule being rovi-
brationally and/or electronically excited; dissociative attachment is another possible exit
channel. Resonances occur at a ﬁxed collision energy and structures in elastic/inelastic dif-
ferential cross sections (DCS) are their experimental signatures. In order to support discrete
states in a continuum, an electron incident on a molecule should experience a suﬃcient at-
tractive ﬁeld. For neutral molecules, such interactions are rather weak. At low energies (0-3
eV), shape resonances occur when the incident electron is trapped in a potential barrier
created by the combined eﬀects of centrifugal, polarization, and exchange forces related to
the ground electronic state of the molecule. Shape resonances can also be associated with
electronically excited states. Rydberg states of molecules, on the other hand, support Fes-
hbach resonances where the temporary negative ion arises from two electrons in Rydberg
orbitals trapped in the ﬁeld of the positive ion core. Feshbach resonances are normally
bound by appreciable barriers (∼200-500 meV) and occur at energies that lie just below
the ‘parent’ Rydberg state. However, such trapping cannot be invoked for resonances near
valence excited states. Resonances associated with these states have been postulated but
several experimental attempts in the past to observe a Feshbach resonance below molec-

the valence-excited a3Π state of CO, which lies 6.01 eV above the ground electronic state
[9,10]. This state possesses a large electric dipole moment of 1.38 D and might, therefore, be
considered a good candidate for temporarily binding an incoming electron in the interaction
potential well. In contrast, the isoelectronic counterpart, the B3Πg state in N2 (7.35 eV),
has no permanent electric dipole moment.

24 years ago Wong and Schulz [5] studied the electron-impact DCSs of elastic and vi-
brational excitation (ν=1,2) of CO in its ground electronic state (1Σ+) in the energy range
6-7 eV. They observed structures in the elastic and inelastic DCSs at energies that were
coincident with the ν=0,1 and 2 levels of the a3Π state of CO. These structures had the
same cross section values at scattering angles θ=50◦ and 90◦. Therefore, the opening of
a channel resulting in excitation of the a3Π state was ruled out as the resulting p-wave
character would have exhibited a strong decrease in the magnitude of the DCS at θ=90◦.
Wong and Schulz postulated that the structures in the DCSs arose from dipole-dominated
resonances, and suggested that the potential-energy curve (PEC) of the negative ion must
be coincident with that of the a3Π state, and must exhibit the same Franck-Condon factors.
On the other hand, in the case of isoelectronic N2 no sharp structures were observed in the

2

elastic or vibrational excitation cross section functions in the vicinity of the corresponding
valence B3Πg state.

We have employed an ab initio bound-state multireference conﬁguration interaction
(MRDCI) approach in our study. Out of various quartet states of diﬀerent symmetries
we identify the 4Σ− state of CO− which can be derived from the 3Π state of CO. The
electronic conﬁguration of the latter state is (core)4(1σ)2(2σ)2(3σ)1(1π)4(2π)1. The lowest
partially-ﬁlled antibonding orbital is 2π and there is a hole in the 3σ orbital. The resultant
4Σ− state of CO− is derived when an extra electron occupies the antibonding 2π orbital.
Consequently, one expects the equilibrium bond length (re) of the 4Σ− state to be longer than
that of the neutral a3Π state. In order to compute the PECs for both the neutral and anion
states we employed the correlation-consistent triple-ζ atomic basis set (CC-PVTZ) with an
augmented set of diﬀuse (spd) orbitals, that is, a [5s4p3d1f] set of contracted gaussian-type
functions [11] were placed on the two nuclei to obtain the molecular orbitals (MOs). The
calculations were performed using the MRDCI package developed by Buenker, Peyerimhoﬀ
and coworkers [12]. The technical details of our computations are as follows: We used 90
atomic basis functions to obtain the SCF MOs to generate the CI conﬁguration space. For
both CO and CO− the SCF MOs were optimized for the lowest 1Σ+ and 2Π conﬁgurations,
respectively. The 1s core of both C and O was kept frozen and 4 high-lying MOs were
excluded. Thus, for the CI step of the calculations, conﬁgurations were constructed from 84
MOs, eﬀectively for 10 or 11 electrons. Depending on the distance and symmetry for the
lowest 5 roots of a given irreducible representation of C2v, a set of 30-65 relevant reference
conﬁgurations was iteratively generated for the CI calculations. The threshold values applied
for the selection were 10-30 µHartree. The threshold energy values resulted from our prede-
ﬁned CI matrix dimension of 14000. We chose this value in order to keep the computational
eﬀort within reasonable limits while maintaining an acceptable, chosen accuracy of the ﬁnal
results. The ﬁnal CI wave functions were well represented by the reference conﬁguration
space with squared coeﬃcients of the main conﬁgurations being 0.91-0.94. The calculated
ground-state CI value, including the MRDCI threshold extrapolation and the Davidson cor-
rection, at re=2.133 ao, was -113.149427 au. The computed dissociation energy with respect
to the zero-point energy of the ground-state was 11.015 eV, compared to the experimental
value of 11.09 eV [9]. The re value of the 3Π state was 1.210 ao [re (experimental)=1.206 ao].
The potential energies of the neutral and anion states were calculated at intervals of 0.1 ao
in the range 1.8-3.0 ao, and a polynomial ﬁt was employed to visualize the PECs.

It is important to note here the diﬃculties associated with computations of PECs of res-
onant molecular anion states [3]. With the addition of one electron to the neutral molecule,
the amount of electron correlation increases, and computations must therefore involve larger
basis sets with extended diﬀused functions. However, it has also been argued that the use of
larger basis sets may not help in describing the actual anion state, but may actually describe
a state of neutral molecule plus free electron (NMFE) [13]. In other words, the computation
may undergo a variational collapse in that the variational energy would tend towards the
true ground state of the neutral molecule. Such an eﬀect has recently been pointed out in
−
calculations of the PECs of H
2 [14]. It may be that in order to achieve meaningful results
a larger basis set should be employed but with a truncated limit for which a variational col-
lapse can be avoided because of certain constraints (like orthogonality conditions, absence
of continuum functions in the basis). We have found that on going from the CC-PVTZ basis

3

to an augmented set with diﬀused sets of (sp) and (spd) functions, the 1Σ+ and a3Π state
of CO remained virtually unchanged while the 4Σ− state of CO− showed further stabiliza-
tion with the use of more extended basis. However, we believe that with our augmented
set of (spd) functions, the calculations are fairly stabilized. To ascertain this, we further
augmented a diﬀuse set of f-functions, that is, computations were performed with AUG-
CC-PVTZ basis set near the equilibrium distance of the 4Σ− state. These computations
conﬁrmed stabilization within the associated computed accuracy of a few tenths of an eV.
A similar AUG-CC-PVTZ basis has been recently employed to describe the 4Σ−
g and 4Πu
states of N−
2 [3]. There does not seem to be any variational collapse in that case and the
computed state is not an NMFE state. To summarize, our study of CO− shows that (i) our
computations are stabilized and (ii) the 4Σ− state shows a distinctly larger re value. It has
been argued [14] that a free electron in the asymptotic limit would not signiﬁcantly perturb
re of a neutral molecular state. We are therefore led to conclude that the present 4Σ− state
describes a resonant CO− state and not a CO+free electron NMFE state.

Our computed PECs along with associated vibrational energy levels are shown in Fig.
1. The energies of the ν=0,1,2 and 3 levels of the 3Π state of CO are 6.04, 6.26, 6.48, and
6.69 eV, respectively (with respect to the ν=0 level of the ground electronic state). These
energy levels match the sharp spikes observed in the DCSs measured by Wong and Schulz
[5]. The computed Franck-Condon factors for these vibrational levels with respect to ν=0
of the ground state are 0.258, 0.339, 0.234, and 0.116, respectively. The FC factors for ν=4
(0.042) and higher levels are very small. The equilibrium distances that we compute for the
3Π and 4Σ− state are 2.283 ao and 2.440 ao, respectively. The energy diﬀerence between
the minima (∆Ee) of these two states is 0.14 eV, and the diﬀerence between the zero-point
energy levels (∆Eo) is 0.11 eV. The vibrational energy levels for ν=0,1,2 and 3 levels of
the 4Σ− state with respect to the ν=0 of the ground state are at 6.15, 6.32, 6.49 and 6.66
eV, respectively. The energies of the ν=1-3 levels are nearly coincident with those of the
vibrational levels of the 3Π state (ﬁg. 1). Since none of these states are accessible in the
Franck-Condon region we rationalize the occurrence of the Wong-Schulz resonance as a two
step process: e+CO (1Σ+; ν=0) → e + CO (a3Π; ν=0,1,2,3) → CO−(4Σ−; ν = 1, 2, 3). That
is, on electron impact, the CO molecule is ﬁrst excited into the accessible vibrational states
of the lowest a3Π state, and then capture of the electron takes place into vibrational levels
(ν=0-3) of CO−. Therefore, one would expect the resonances to occur at the vibrational
energies of the 4Σ− state. Considering the experimental energy resolution of 0.055 eV for
elastic scattering and 0.035 eV for vibrational excitation [5], the location of the ν=2 and 3
resonances match extremely well on the energy scale, but in the case of ν=0 and 1, they are
slightly displaced (by 0.1 eV and 0.03 eV, respectively). It is possible that the anion state
may become further stabilized at even higher theoretical levels (employing more extended
basis sets). Nevertheless, the present computations establish the existence of a resonant 4Σ−
state of CO−. The isotropic nature of the measured DCSs can also now be rationalized: it
results from the interplay between the resonant state of Σ character and the a3Π state of
neutral CO.

We now consider recently observed signatures of long-lived (lifetime >few µs) CO− and
N −
[6,7,15]. The extensive literature on e-CO (-N2) collisions [8] documents several res-
2
onances in these molecules, each possessing a lifetime of the order of a few femtoseconds.
Recent observations of anions like N −
2 and CO− that are stable for at least a few microsec-

g ) that are derived from the valence-excited states of N2, A3Σ +

onds suggest electronically excited precursor states. Sommerfeld and Cederbaum [3] have
recently performed high-level computations for two possible quartet states of N −
(4Πu and
2
4Σ−
u and B3Πg, respectively.
One of the anion states (4Πu) was identiﬁed as a possible candidate for long lifetime, having
a zero-point energy (ZPE) that was almost coincident with that of the neutral state. Cal-
culations with further augmentation of basis indicated that this anion state might indeed
possess a positive electron aﬃnity. However, the computational accuracy was such that the
sign of electron aﬃnity could not be unambiguously determined. Sommerfeld and Ceder-
baum estimated the associated lifetime of the 4Πu state to be of the order of picoseconds.
In the light of these observations one might expect that the 4Σ− state of CO− might
also possess a positive electron aﬃnity with respect to the a3Π parent state. The present
study does point to this intriguing possibility, although much elaborate (and expensive)
computations would be needed to settle the issue. If such lowering of the energy of the 4Σ−
state does indeed occur, then the following mechanism might account for the longevity of
the CO− anions in recent experiments. Collisional relaxation of the higher CO− levels to
the ZPE level would become possible in the presence of a third body, M: CO− (4Σ−; ν >
0) + M → CO−(4Σ−; ν = 0). Such a possibility is, of course, remote in e-CO experiments
but may be possible in the hot plasma environments that are created in the intense-ﬁeld
and sputtering experiments. Note that the Franck-Condon factors for the 4Σ− → X 1Σ+
transition are very unfavorable.

Our results suggest several experimental and theoretical avenues that ought to be ex-
plored. Further work on metastable CO− states associated with higher excited states of CO
is in progress in our laboratory.

Abstract. Precise predictions of atomic energy levels require the use of QED, espe-
cially in highly-charged ions, where the inner electrons have relativistic velocities. We
present an overview of the two-time Green’s function method; this method allows one
to calculate level shifts in two-electron highly-charged ions by including in principle
all QED eﬀects, for any set of states (degenerate, quasi-degenerate or isolated). We
present an evaluation of the contribution of the screened self-energy to a ﬁnite-sized
eﬀective hamiltonian that yields the energy levels through diagonalization.

1 Experiments and Theory

Experimental measurements of atomic energy levels provide more and more
stringent tests of theoretical models; thus, the experimental accuracy of many
measurements is better than the precision of theoretical calculations: in hydro-
gen [1,2], in helium [3,4], and in lithium-like uranium [5] and bismuth [6]. The
current status of many precision tests of Quantum-Electrodynamics in hydrogen
and helium can be found in this edition.

Furthermore, highly-charged ions possess electrons that move with a velocity
which is close to the speed of light. The theoretical study of such systems must
therefore take into account relativity; moreover, a perturbative treatment of the
binding to the nucleus (with coupling constant Zα) fails in this situation [7].
Perturbative expansions in Zα, however, are useful in diﬀerent situations (see
[8] for a review, and articles in this edition [9,10,11,12]).

2 Theoretical Methods for Highly-Charged Ions

There are only a few number of methods that can be used in order to predict
energy levels for highly-charged ions within the framework of Bound-State Quan-
tum Electrodynamics [13]: the adiabatic S-matrix formalism of Gell-Mann, Low
and Sucher [14], the evolution operator method [15,16], the two-time Green’s
function method [17] and an interesting method recently proposed by Lindgren
(based on Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation Theory merged with QED) [18].

2

´Eric-Olivier Le Bigot et al.

All these methods are based on a study of the some evolution operator or propa-
gator; the two extreme times of the propagation can be both inﬁnite (Gell-Mann–
Low–Sucher), one can be ﬁnite and the other inﬁnite (Lindgren), and both can
be ﬁnite (Shabaev).

But among these methods, only two can in principle be used in order to apply
perturbation theory to quasi-degenerate levels (e.g., the 3P1 and 1P1 levels in
helium-like ions): the two-time Green’s function method and Lindgren’s method
(which is still under development). Both work by constructing a ﬁnite-sized
eﬀective hamiltonian whose eigenvalues give the energy levels [19].

The two-time Green’s function method has the advantage of being applicable
to many atomic physics problems, such as the recombination of an electron with
an ion [20], the shape of spectral lines [21] and the eﬀect of nuclear recoil on
atomic energy levels [22,23].

2.1 Overview of the Two-Time Green’s Function Method

We give in this section a short outline of the two-time Green’s function method.
The basic object of this method [24] represents the probability amplitude for N
fermions to go from one position to the other, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. The 2-particle Green’s function is the amplitude for going from one state of
two particles to another state

The corresponding mathematical object is a usual N -particle correlation

where |Ωi is the vacuum of the full Bound-State QED Hamiltonian ˆH, and
where the quantum ﬁeld ˆΨ is deﬁned as the usual canonical electron–positron
ﬁeld evolving under the total hamiltonian in the Heisenberg picture [13].

A remark can be made here about Lorentz invariance: the above correlation
function (or propagator) displays only two times, which are associated to many
diﬀerent positions. A Lorentz transform of the space–time positions involved

(cid:13)

therefore yields many diﬀerent individual times (one for each position); thus,
the object (1) must be deﬁned in a speciﬁc reference frame. And this reference
frame is chosen as nothing more than the Galilean reference frame associated to
the nucleus, which is physically privileged.

Fundamental Property of the Green’s Function

The N -particle Green’s function is a function of energy simply deﬁned through
a Fourier transform of Eq. (1):

GN (x1, . . . , xN ; x′

(3)

This function is interesting because it contains the energy levels predicted by
Bound-State QED: one can show [24] that

,

where |Ωi is the vacuum of the total hamiltonian ˆH; ˆψ is the usual second-
quantized Dirac ﬁeld in the Schr¨odinger representation and En is the energy
of the eigenstate n of ˆH. The poles in E with a positive real part are exactly
the energies of the states with charge −N |e|, which are physically the atomic
eigenstates of an ion with N orbiting electrons (The charge of the nucleus is not
counted in the total charge.), as shown graphically in Fig. 2. Such a result is
similar to the so-called K¨all´en–Lehmann representation [25].

In order to obtain the energy levels contained in (4), we must resort on a per-
turbative calculation of the correlation function (1), which belongs to standard
textbook knowledge [26]. The position of the poles of (4) must then be mathe-
matically found. It is possible to construct an eﬀective, ﬁnite-size hamiltonian
which acts on the atomic state that one is interested in; the eigenvalues of this
hamiltonian then give the Bound-State QED evaluation of the energy levels [19].
This hamiltonian is obtained through contour integrations.

2.2 Second-Order Calculations

The current state-of-the-art in non-perturbative calculations (in Zα) of atomic
energy levels within Bound-State QED consists in the theoretical evaluation

Fig. 2. The 2-particle Green’s function contains information about the atomic energy
levels of a 2-electron atom or ion

of the contribution of diagrams with two photons (i.e. of order α2, since the
electron–photon coupling constant is e). For instance, for ions with two electrons,
the screening of one electron by the other is described by the six diagrams of
Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. The contributions of order α2

to the electron-electron interaction

However, most of the calculations of contributions of order α2 were, until
very recently, restricted to the very speciﬁc case of the ground-state (see [27]
for references). The extension to the calculation of the energy levels of quasi-
degenerate states represents one of the current trends of the research in the
domain of non-perturbative (in Zα) calculations with QED.

We have calculated the contribution of the screened self-energy (ﬁrst and
fourth diagrams of Fig. 3) to some isolated levels in [27,28,29,30]. When energy
levels are quasi-degenerate (e.g., the 3P1 and 1P1 levels in helium-like ions), the
two-time Green’s function method allows one to evaluate the matrix elements of
the eﬀective hamiltonian between diﬀerent states; for the ﬁrst diagram of Fig. 3,
we obtain the following contribution to this hamiltonian (The two electrons on
the left are denoted by n1 and n2, and the two on the right by n′

The terms of order α2(E(0)
n ) are not included in the above expression
because they do not contribute to the level shift of order α2 in which we are
interested. (They contribute to higher orders, as can be seen in the particular
case of two levels [31, p. 27].)

n′ − E(0)

This expression is only formal and must be renormalized [27]; angular in-
tegrations can then be done and numerical computations can be performed in
order to yield the Bound-State QED evaluation of the energy shifts.

For the contribution of the ﬁrst diagram of Fig. 3 to have any physical mean-
ing, it is necessary to calculate it together with the vertex correction (fourth
diagram of Fig. 3). We have obtained the following contribution to the eﬀective
hamiltonian for the vertex correction:

3 Conclusion and Outlook

We have presented a quick overview of the current status of theoretical predic-
tions of energy levels in highly-charged ions with Bound-State Quantum Elec-
trodynamics. We have given a short description of the two-time Green’s function
method, which permits the calculation of an eﬀective hamiltonian that can in
principle include all QED eﬀects in energy shifts. We have also presented the
speciﬁc contribution of the screened self-energy in the general case (isolated lev-
els, quasi-degenerate or degenerate levels); the expression obtained can serve as
a basis for numerical calculations of the corresponding eﬀective hamiltonian.

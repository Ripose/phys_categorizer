The hyperﬁne induced 2s 2p 3P0 → 2s2 1S0 transition rate AHFI in berylliumlike 47Ti18+ was
measured. Resonant electron-ion recombination in a heavy-ion storage ring was employed to monitor

the time dependent population of the 3P0 state. The experimental value AHFI = 0.56(3) s

Atoms and ions in metastable excited states with very
small electromagnetic transition rates are promising sys-
tems for realizing ultraprecise atomic clocks, for the di-
agnostic of astrophysical media regarding the competi-
tion of radiative and non-radiative processes, for realiz-
ing novel types of cold atomic gases, and for probing fun-
damental correlation eﬀects in the bound states of few-
electron systems. In particular, in alkaline-earth-like and,
in general, divalent atoms and ions, having a (ns)2 1S0
ground state and a valence shell n, the ﬁrst excited level
above the ground state is the term ns np 3P0 (Fig. 1).
The absence of a total electronic angular momentum J
for this level makes its single photon decay to the ground
state impossible except for the hyperﬁne induced decay in
the case of a nucleus with a spin I 6= 0. For I 6= 0 the hy-
perﬁne interaction mixes states with diﬀerent J and the
ns np 3P0 term aquires a ﬁnite, but long and strongly
isotope-dependent radiative lifetime. These hyperﬁne-
dominated decay rates have been treated theoretically
for beryllium-, magnesium-, and zinclike ions [1, 2, 3, 4]
and for divalent heavier atoms [5, 6], where the long and
isotope-dependent lifetimes are attractive in view of ob-
taining ultraprecise optical frequency standards and for
cold-atom studies. In low-density astrophysical systems,
the ﬂuorescence observed from the hyperﬁne-induced ra-
diative decay of the long-lived 2s2p 3P0 level in the beryl-
liumlike ion 13C2+ can be used to infer the 13C/12C abun-
dance ratio, giving insight into stellar nucleosynthesis [7].
in divalent
ns np 3P0 states were so far determined experimentally
only for the atomic-clock transition 5s5p 3P0-5s2 1S0 of
115In+ in a radio-frequency ion trap [10], with an ∼5%
uncertainty, and for the beryllium-like ion N3+ [11] using
observations from a planetary nebula and yielding an un-
certainty of 33%. The 115In+ result is in good agreement
with estimates on hyperﬁne mixing based on experimen-
tal spectral parameters of the atom [10], while the N3+
result, even at its limited precision, allows one to discrim-
inate between the lifetimes predicted by atomic struc-
ture calculations [1, 3] that diﬀer by a factor of almost

FIG. 1: Simpliﬁed level diagram for berylliumlike Ti18+. The
level energies were taken from the NIST Atomic Spectra Data
Base [8], and the lifetimes (in s) labeling the excited levels
were calculated from theoretical one-photon transition rates
[9] that do not account for hyperﬁne eﬀects. Numbers in
square brackets denote powers of 10. In case of nonzero nu-
clear spin the hyperﬁne induced (HFI) 3P0 → 1S0 transi-
tion rate AHFI acquires a ﬁnite value. The 1P1 → 1S0 elec-
tric dipole (E1), 3P2 → 1S0 magnetic quadrupole (M2), and
3P1 → 1S0 intercombination (IC) transitions are also shown.

4. In view of the large theoretical discrepancies in the
atomic-structure based calculations and the scarce ex-
perimental data, accurate experimental benchmarks are
highly desirable, especially for few-electron systems such
as beryllium-like ions with particularly strong correlation
eﬀects.

Among the few-electron systems, HFI transitions were
also studied for highly charged helium-like ions [12].
However, in contrast to the present case they do not rep-
resent the only radiative decay path, but compete with
allowed transitions such as 1s2p 3P0-1s2s 3S1. More-
over, the resulting lifetimes are generally much shorter
than in a divalent system with comparable valence shell
and nuclear charge; the HFI decay rate variations stud-
ied so far for the 1s2p 3P0-1s2 1S0 line are in the range
of 107–1012 s−1 [13, 14, 15, 16].

In the present work we obtain an experimental value
for the decay rate of the long-lived 2s 2p 3P0 state in
47Ti18+ (I = 5/2) through radiative transitions induced
by the hyperﬁne interaction only. This decay limits the

lifetime of the 2s 2p 3P0 state in 47Ti18+ to ∼1.8 s.
A benchmark HFI decay rate for this highly charged
beryllium-like system is obtained with an uncertainty
of ∼5% (almost an order of magnitude lower than that
accomplished previously [11]); the observed decay rate
is signiﬁcantly larger than the only available theoretical
prediction [1], which instead would predict a lifetime of
∼2.8 s. The experiment uses fast, isotopically pure ion
beams of 47Ti18+ and 48Ti18+ (I = 0) circulating for
up to 200 s in the heavy-ion storage ring TSR of the
Max-Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, Heidelberg,
Germany. The new high-resolution electron-ion collision
spectrometer [17] at this facility is used to detect a signal
proportional to Ti18+ ions in the metastable 2s 2p 3P0
state. For this purpose, the electron-ion collision en-
ergy is tuned to a value where dielectronic recombina-
tion (DR) occurs only for ions in this excited level, and
the rate of recombined Ti17+ ions produced at this colli-
sion energy is recorded as a function of the storage time.
This method had been applied previously for measuring
the slow radiative decay rates of 1s 2s 3S states in the
He-like ions (B3+, C4+, N5+ [18] and Li+ [19]).

Mass selected 47,48Ti18+ ion beams (natural abun-
dances 7.2% and 73.7%, respectively) were provided by
a tandem accelerator, followed by a radio-frequency lin-
ear accelerator, at energies close to 240 MeV, using a
ﬁxed magnetic setting for the beam line and the stor-
age ring (magnetic rigidity 0.8533 Tm). The residual gas
pressure in the storage ring was < 5 × 10−11 mbar. In
one straight section of the storage ring (circumference
C = 55.4 m) the ion beam was continuously phase-space
cooled using the velocity-matched electron beam of the
TSR electron cooler (electron density ∼ 5.0 × 107 cm−3).
In a second straight section, the ion beam was merged
with the collinear electron beam of the high-resolution
electron target [17], run at variable acceleration voltage
in order to set the required collision energy in the co-
moving reference frame of the ions. At collision energies
of 0–2 eV, the electron density in the electron target was
5.6 × 107 cm−3. Ti17+ ions formed by electron-ion re-
combination in the electron target or by charge transfer
in collisions with residual gas molecules were deﬂected
out of the closed orbit of the circulating Ti18+ ion beam
in the ﬁrst dipole magnet downstream of the electron
target and were directed onto a scintillation detector op-
erated in single-particle counting mode with nearly 100%
detection eﬃciency and negligible dark count rate. The
overlap lengths were ∼1.5 m each in both interaction re-
gions. The cooled ion beam velocities for the two iso-
topes, as obtained from the space-charge corrected [20]
electron acceleration voltage at velocity matching, were
β(48) = 0.1026(1) and β(47) = 0.1047(1) (in units of the
vacuum speed of light).

Recombination spectra of the Ti18+ ions as a function
of the relative electron-ion energy, Erel, were taken by
varying the cathode voltage of the electron target appro-

Electron-ion collision energy (eV)

FIG. 2: Measured rate coeﬃcients for the electron-ion recom-
bination of 48Ti18+ (upper panel) and 47Ti18+ (lower panel) in
the energy range of interest. The resonances that are formed
by resonant dielectronic capture of the initially free electron
are assigned to doubly excited Ti17+ states as indicated with
the aid of theoretical calculations using the autostructure
code [21]. A comprehensive plot of the 48Ti18+ recombina-
tion spectrum extending over the entire experimental energy
range of 0–80 eV can be found in Ref. [22].

priately. The procedure for electron-ion measurements at
the TSR storage ring has been described in more detail
in, e. g., Ref. [20] (and references therein). For the present
spectral measurements, a constant current of cooled, cir-
culating Ti18+ ions was maintained. Currents of a frac-
tion of a µA were injected at a rate of ∼1 s−1 in order to
obtain stationary stored currents of ∼40 µA for 48Ti18+
and ∼6 µA for 47Ti18+, respectively; this largely reﬂects
the diﬀerence in the natural isotope abundances. The
average storage lifetime in this mode is ∼50 s.

Figure 2 shows a region of the recombination spectrum
where resonances of metastable Ti18+(2s2p 3P0) ions oc-
cur close to a strong resonance from ground-state Ti18+
ions. Theoretical calculations using the autostruc-
ture code [21] were performed to assign the weaker
structures to the metastables, which decay by collisional
interactions for only the 48Ti18+ beam [Fig. 2(a)]. Us-
ing a 47Ti18+ beam [Fig. 2(b)], the resonances assigned
to metastable Ti18+(2s2p 3P0) ions essentially disappear,
as their average population is strongly reduced through
the radiative decay (expected life time 2.8 s [1]). The
isotope-dependent occurrence of DR resonances was also
observed in earlier TSR experiments, using the heav-
ier divalent ion Pt48+ (Zn-like) [23]. The autostruc-
ture calculations of the recombination spectrum indi-
cate an average population of ∼5% for the metastable
Ti18+(2s2p 3P0) ions in the stored 48Ti18+ beam. A
similar average population of the 2s2p 3P0 metastable
state was found in a recent DR experiment with Be-like
56Fe22+ [24].

For the determination of the time constant associ-
ated with the hyperﬁne quenching the decay of the
47Ti18+(3P0) beam component was monitored as a func-
tion of storage time. To this end the relative electron-ion
energy in the electron target was set ﬁxed to 0.75 eV
where a DR resonance associated with excitation of the
3P0 state occurs (vertical arrow in Fig. 2). After injec-
tion of a single Ti18+ ion pulse into the storage ring the
recombination rate was recorded for up to 200 s. Prior
to the injection of the next pulse the remaining ions were
kicked out of the ring. This scheme was repeated to re-
duce statistical uncertainties to a suitable level.

Figure 3 displays the two decay curves that were ob-
tained for the two isotopes with A = 48 and A = 47.
Since the recombination signal was produced by both 1S0
and 3P0 ions the sum of two exponentials, i. e., the func-

was ﬁtted to the measured decay curves [18, 19]. As dis-
cussed in more detail below, the 1S0 state contributes also
at Erel = 0.75 eV to the measured recombination signal
by nonresonant radiative recombination and by electron
capture from the residual gas. The ﬁt results are listed

lisions of the Ti18+ ions with residual gas particles is neg-
ligibly small. Collisional excitation has been investigated
in previous experimental measurements of metastable
state lifetimes, e. g., with stored Xe+ [26], C4+ [18] and
Li+ [19] ions. In all these cases collisional processes were
found to have a negligibly small inﬂuence on the popula-
tion of the metastable states under investigation, mainly
because of the low residual particle density in the ul-
trahigh vacuum of the storage ring. Since the residual
gas pressure and the collisional excitation cross sections
of the present experiment and of the above mentioned
studies are of the same order of magnitude, collisional
excitation and deexcitation processes are assumed to be
negligible within the experimental uncertainty.

With this assumption the ﬁtted rate constants can be

expressed as [18]

where Ar is the radiative decay rate of the 3P0 state and
ADC is the decay rate of this state due to dielectronic
capture (DC) into the (2s 2p 1P1) 11d and (2s 2p 3P2) 26l
doubly excited states (Fig. 2). Loss of 3P0 ions occurs if
these states decay either via photon emission (in this case
DR has occurred) or via autoionization to the 2s2 1S0
ground state. Since DC and the subsequent relaxation
processes are not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by hyperﬁne ef-
fects the rate ADC is the same for both isotopes. The
rates Agl and Aml describe the loss of 1S0 ground state
and of 3P0 metastable ions, respectively, from the stor-
age ring. The most important processes that lead to
the loss of ions from the storage ring are collisions with
residual-gas particles and electron-ion recombination in
the electron cooler.

The loss rate Agl is diﬀerent for the two isotopes be-
cause the 47Ti18+ and 48Ti18+ ions are stored with diﬀer-
ent velocities v and because of the velocity dependence
of the relevant cross sections σ. With σ ∝ v−x it fol-
lows that Agl ∝ vσ ∝ v1−x. The exponent x can be
gl = [β(48)/β(47)]1−x yielding
determined from A(48)
x = 10(1). This value is consistent with the empirical
v−9.6 scaling [27] of the cross section for charge capture
during collisions of highly charged ions with neutral resid-
ual gas particles.

gl /A(47)

The ionization energies of the 1S0 ground state and the
3P0 metastable state, 1346 eV and 1310 eV, respectively
[8], diﬀer by less than 3%. Therefore, it can safely be

assumed that the loss rates for both states are approx-
imately equal, i. e., that Aml = Agl. This assumption
does not lead to any serious consequences. As will be
shown below, the ﬁnal result for the HFI transition rate
changes only insigniﬁcantly when, e. g., Aml = 2Agl is
assumed.

With the assumption of Aml = Agl Eq. 2 can be solved

lated as

where the relativistic factor γ(47) = [1 − (β(47))2]−1/2 =
1.00531(1) occurs because of the transformation into the
ion’s frame of reference. With the values for λ(A)
m,g from
Tab. I one obtains AHFI = 0.56(3) s−1. With the assump-
tion of Aml = 2Agl (see above) the result would change
to AHFI = 0.54(3) s−1. This change is within the exper-
imental uncertainty which is mainly determined by the
statistical uncertainty of λ(47)
m (Tab. I). It shows the rel-
atively low sensitivity of the experimental radiative rate
on the diﬀerence between Aml and Agl.

The remaining issue to be discussed is the possible
quenching of the 3P0 state in the magnetic ﬁelds of the
storage ring magnets [28] via the B-ﬁeld induced mixing
of the 3P0 state with the 3P1 state. The magnitude of
the mixing coeﬃcient is of the order of µBB/∆E where
µB is the Bohr magneton and ∆E is the 3P0 − 3P1 energy
splitting. For the present experiment it is estimated that
the 3P0 →1 S0 transition rate by B-ﬁeld induced mixing
is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than AHFI.
Therefore, it can safely be neglected.

The present experimental value AHFI = 0.56(3) s−1
for the hyperﬁne induced 3P0 → 1S0 transition rate in
Be-like 47Ti18+ with I = 5/2 is 57% larger than the the-
oretical value of 0.3556 s−1 [1]. It has been shown that
calculated values of AHFI are very sensitive to electron-
electron correlation [3].
If correlation is treated more
thoroughly, HFI transition rates larger by factors of up
to 4 [3] (see above) are obtained as compared with a
less extensive treatment [1]. Therefore, the present dis-
crepancy between experiment and theory is ascribed to
a partial neglect of important correlation eﬀects in the
theoretical calculation.

In summary, in this work an experimental value from
a laboratory measurement is presented for the very low
hyperﬁne induced 3P0 → 1S0 transition rate in Be-like
Ti18+. It is almost an order of magnitude more precise
than the only previous experimental value for isoelec-
tronic N3+ [11] that was obtained from astrophysical ob-
servations and modeling. The present value for the HFI
transition rate exceeds the only presently available the-

4

oretical result [1] by 57%. This diﬀerence is attributed
to electron correlation eﬀects that were included only ap-
proximately in the theoretical calculation. An essential
feature of the present experimental method is the com-
parison of measured results from diﬀerent isotopes with
zero and nonzero nuclear spin. The method is readily
applicable to a wide range of ions and has the potential
for yielding even more accurate results.

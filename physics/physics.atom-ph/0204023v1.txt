Abstract

We demonstrate two ways of obtaining sub-natural linewidth for probe ab-

sorption through room-temperature Rb vapor. Both techniques use a control

laser that drives the transition from a diﬀerent ground state. The coherent

drive splits the excited state into two dressed states (Autler-Townes doublet),

which have asymmetric linewidths when the control laser is detuned from

resonance. In the ﬁrst technique, the laser has a large detuning of 1.18 GHz

to reduce the linewidth to 5.1 MHz from the Doppler width of 560 MHz. In

the second technique, we use a counter-propagating pump beam to eliminate

the ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect. The unperturbed probe linewidth is about 13

MHz, which is reduced below 3 MHz (0.5Γ) at a detuning of 11.5 MHz.

Laser spectroscopy in a room-temperature gas is often limited by Doppler broadening due

to the thermal velocity of gas particles. However, techniques such as saturated-absorption

spectroscopy using counter-propagating pump and probe beams can be used to eliminate the

ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect and linewidths close to the natural linewidth can be obtained. But

overcoming the natural linewidth is not easy and it appears as a fundamental limit to the

resolution that can be achieved in precision spectroscopy. The natural linewidth also plays

a role in other areas. For example, in laser cooling of atoms and ions, the lowest attainable

temperature (Doppler limit) is determined by the natural linewidth of the cooling transition.

In addition, when lasers are locked to atomic transitions, the natural linewidth determines

the tightness of the lock. It is therefore desirable to develop techniques for getting below

the natural linewidth.

In this Letter, we demonstrate two techniques to obtain sub-natural linewidth in a room-

temperature vapor of Rb atoms. The techniques have been adapted from recent develop-

ments in the use of control lasers in three-level systems as a means of modifying the ab-

sorption properties of a weak probe beam [1]. For example, in electromagnetically induced

transparency (EIT), an initially absorbing medium is made transparent to the probe when

a strong control laser is turned on [2]. We use a Λ-type system, where the control laser

drives the transition from one ground state, and the probe laser measures absorption from

the other ground state. The control laser creates two dressed states [3] and the probe ab-

sorption splits into an Autler-Townes doublet. The key idea is that, when the control laser

is detuned from resonance, the two dressed states have asymmetric linewidths, such that

their sum is the unperturbed linewidth [4,5]. This asymmetry persists even when the peaks

are inhomogeneously broadened. Thus, for suitable detuning, the width of one state can be

much smaller than the unperturbed linewidth.

There have been previous experimental studies on linewidth narrowing using a control

laser, but this was in the spontaneous-emission spectrum of a three-level V system [6]. The

experiments were done using an atomic beam where the Doppler broadening was negligible.

By contrast, our experiments show sub-natural linewidth in the absorption spectrum and

2

are done in room-temperature vapor with Doppler broadening of 560 MHz. Furthermore,

we use a Λ system and the basic mechanism for linewidth narrowing is diﬀerent.

In the

V system, the ground state is coupled by the control laser to a weak auxiliary transition.

Spontaneous emission from the excited state is suppressed because the quantum ﬂuctuations

in the ground state are stabilized by the control laser, as shown by Narducci et al. [1]. In our

case, linewidth narrowing occurs because of quantum coherences in the excited state created

by the control laser.

To understand these ideas more clearly, let us consider the three-level Λ system in 87Rb

in greater detail. The relevant energy levels are shown in Fig. 1. The lower levels |1i and

|2i are the F = 1 and F = 2 hyperﬁne levels in the 5S1/2 ground state, while the upper

level |3i is the 5P3/2 excited state. The excited state has four hyperﬁne levels; of these, only

the levels with F ′ = 1 and 2 couple to both the lower levels and can act as level |3i. The

control laser drives the |1i ↔ |3i transition with Rabi frequency ΩR and detuning ∆c. The

weak probe laser measures the absorption on the |1i → |2i transition at a detuning ∆. The

excited state lifetime is 26 ns, threfore the spontaneous decay rates Γ31 and Γ32 are both

equal to 2π × 6.1 MHz.

The absorption of the weak probe in the Λ system has been derived previously [4]. As

is well known, the control laser splits the upper level into two dressed states due to the ac

Stark shift. The probe absorption gets modiﬁed due to this and shows peaks at the location

of the two dressed states (Autler-Townes doublet), given by

It is clear from the above expression that, if ∆c = 0, the two peaks are symmetric and have

identical linewidths of (Γ31 + Γ32) /4. However, for any non-zero detuning, the peaks have

3

asymmetric linewidths. The ﬁrst peak has larger linewidth while the second peak has smaller

linewidth by precisely the same factor, in such a way that the sum of the two linewidths is

equal to the unperturbed linewidth, (Γ31 + Γ32) /2.

The above analysis is for a stationary atom. If the atom is moving, the laser frequency

and detuning as seen by the atom are velocity dependent. To obtain the probe absorption

in a gas of moving atoms, the above expressions have to be corrected for the velocity of the

atom and then averaged over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities. Such an

analysis has been done in Ref. [4], and the important conclusion is that the location of the

peaks given in Eq. (1) does not change, but the linewidths are now given by

Here, D is the usual Doppler width, which is 560 MHz for room-temperature Rb atoms.

Thus, the earlier conclusions are still valid, except that the unperturbed linewidth is now

(Γ31 + Γ32 + 2D) /2, which includes a Doppler broadening term.

The main idea for our experiment is clear from Eq. (3). For ∆c ≫ ΩR, the peak at

R has signiﬁcantly smaller linewidth than the unperturbed value. Indeed,

this was proposed by Vemuri et al. [4] as a means of achieving sub-Doppler resolution when

Doppler broadening dominates the linewidth. Sub-Doppler linewidths were subsequently

observed by Zhu and Wasserlauf [7] in a Rb vapor using an intense control beam from a

Ti-sapphire laser. Our work extends this to sub-natural linewidths and requires only about

25 mW of control-laser power, which is easily available from diode lasers.

In our second

technique, the unperturbed linewidth is close to the natural linewidth and even smaller

powers of ∼1 mW are enough to observe sub-natural linewidth.

The experimental set up is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The probe and control beams

are obtained from two frequency-stabilized diode laser systems operating near the 780 nm

D2 line in Rb. The linewidth of the lasers after stabilization has been measured to be below

1 MHz. The two beams co-propagate through the cell with orthogonal polarizations. For the

second set of experiments, a counter-propagating pump beam is generated from the probe

4

laser using a beamsplitter.

For the ﬁrst set of experiments, we used a control beam with power of 25 mW, corre-

sponding to a Rabi frequency of about 200 MHz. Its detuning, ∆c, was varied from 0 to

−1.18 GHz. Probe-absorption spectra at diﬀerent values of ∆c are shown in Fig. 3(a). The

unperturbed probe absorption is Doppler broadened to 560 MHz, as shown in the top trace.

Therefore, the Doppler width dominates the linewidth. As expected from Eq. (1), there are

two peaks in each spectrum. The ﬁrst peak is near ∆ = 0, and its width is close to the

Doppler width, while the second peak lies near ∆ = ∆c and is much narrower. At small

values of ∆c, the second peak lies within the Doppler proﬁle of the ﬁrst peak. According

to Eq. (3), the width of the second peak decreases as the detuning is increased. This is

indeed what we observe in Fig. 3(b) where the detuning is −1180 MHz. The peak lies well

outside the Doppler proﬁle of the ﬁrst peak (not shown) and has a sub-natural linewidth of

only 5.1 MHz. However, a quantitative comparison of this linewidth to that in Eq. (3) is

not justiﬁed because, as mentioned before, there are two levels in the excited state, F ′ = 1

and 2, that can act as level |3i of the Λ system. The control laser dresses both these levels

and, since the levels are separated by 157 MHz, the value of ∆c for each level is diﬀerent.

Thus, the probe absorption is a convolution of these two absorption proﬁles. This is evident

from Fig. 3(a) where the lower traces have non-Gaussian lineshapes. At larger detunings,

the two levels act as an eﬀective single level, but the linewidth is still probably limited by

the diﬀerence in detuning.

For the second set of experiments, we used a counter-propagating pump beam with

a power of 100 µW, compared to the probe power of 10 µW. In this conﬁguration, the

zero-velocity group of atoms preferentially absorbs from the pump beam and the probe gets

transmitted. This is a standard technique to overcome the ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect, and the

probe transmission shows narrow peaks at the location of the excited-state hyperﬁne levels,

as seen in the middle trace of Fig. 4(a). Ideally, the linewidth of the hyperﬁne peaks should

be the natural linewidth, but our observed linewidth is increased to about 13 MHz. There

are several eﬀects that contribute to this increase; the most important are power broadening

5

due to the pump beam and a small misalignment angle between the counter-propagating

beams [8].

For the bottom trace in Fig. 4(a), the control laser is also turned on. The laser is detuned

by +11.5 MHz from the 5P3/2, F ′ = 2 level. It creates two dressed states near this level, and
the F ′ = 2 peak in the probe spectrum splits into an Autler-Townes doublet. In Fig. 4(b), we

zoom into this region. The control-laser power is 3 mW, corresponding to a Rabi frequency

of 25 MHz. The doublet peaks are well separated and show linewidths of 9.1 MHz and 3.7

MHz, respectively. As expected from Eq. (2), the sum of the two linewidths is equal to the

unperturbed linewidth of ∼13 MHz. In fact, with a value of 12.8 MHz for the unperturbed

linewidth, the widths of the two peaks calculated from Eq. (2) are exactly equal to the

observed values. At lower powers (corresponding to smaller values of ΩR), the linewidth is

still smaller and we have observed linewidths down to 2 MHz. However, the lineshape is

not perfectly Lorentzian, partly because the peaks lie on the side of the Doppler proﬁle. It

is possible to remove the Doppler proﬁle using several methods, such as by subtracting the

absorption of a second identical probe beam, but we have not attempted this so far.

The conﬁguration with the pump beam has the advantage that the control laser, because

of its small detuning and Rabi frequency, only dresses one of the hyperﬁne levels in the ex-

cited state. Thus, this is closer to an ideal three-level system and the theoretical predictions

can be applied with greater conﬁdence. To test this, we have studied the separation of the

two dressed states as a function of control-laser power at a ﬁxed detuning of +11.5 MHz.

The results are shown in Fig. 5. The solid line is the predicted variation from Eq. (1) and

the measured separation agrees very well with the prediction. The linewidths of the two

peaks also follow the dependence given in Eq. (2), with the correction that the unperturbed

linewidth is broadened to about 13 MHz.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that it is possible to get sub-natural linewidth for

probe absorption through a room temperature atomic gas. The Doppler width is reduced

by more than a factor of 100 using a control laser that drives the excited state on a second

transition of the three-level Λ system. The basic mechanism that modiﬁes the probe ab-

6

sorption is the quantum coherences in the excited state created by the control laser. The

creation of resonances with sub-natural linewidth may have immediate applications in pre-

cision spectroscopy and better stabilization of lasers on atomic transitions. It could also be

used to achieve sub-Doppler temperatures in laser cooling of ions. Such low temperatures

are important for future applications in quantum computing using trapped ions where the

ion needs to be cooled to the quantum-mechanical ground state.

Schematic of the experiment. The probe and control beams are derived from diode

laser systems. The power in each beam is set using a half-wave plate (λ/2) and a polarizing

beamsplitter (PBS). The two beams are chosen to have orthogonal polarizations so that they can

be mixed and separated using PBS’s. The probe beam is detected on a silicon photodetector (PD).

A part of the probe beam is split using a beamsplitter (BS) and used as a counter-propagating

pump for the second set of experiments. The angle between the counter-propagating beams is close

to 0 and has been exaggerated for clarity. BD’s are beam dumps.

FIG. 3.

The ﬁgure shows the transmission of the probe beam as a function of frequency

for various values of control-laser detuning, ∆c. In (a), the top trace is the unperturbed probe

absorption showing the usual Doppler proﬁle. The lower traces have a second narrow peak whose

location is given by Eq. (1). The values of ∆c are small enough that the second peak lies within the

Doppler proﬁle of the ﬁrst. The control laser also aﬀects the lineshape of the Doppler-broadened

peak and makes it non-Gaussian. In (b), the control-laser detuning is increased to -1180 MHz. We

zoom into this peak which lies away from the Doppler proﬁle of the ﬁrst peak. The dashed line is

a Lorentzian ﬁt and yields a full-width of 5.1 MHz, compared to the Doppler width of 560 MHz

and the natural linewidth of 6.1 MHz.

In (a), the top trace is the Doppler-broadened proﬁle of the probe beam when both

control and pump beams are oﬀ. In the middle trace, the counter-propagating pump beam is turned

on. The various hyperﬁne transitions (and spurious crossover resonances) are clearly resolved. In

the bottom trace, the control laser is also turned on. Since the laser is tuned close to the F ′ = 2

level, the F ′ = 2 peak splits into an Autler-Townes doublet. In (b), we zoom into the doublet.

The control laser has a Rabi frequency of 25 MHz and detuning of 11.5 MHz. The dashed line is

a Lorentzian ﬁt to the two peaks, and yields a full-width of 9.1 MHz for the larger peak and only

3.7 MHz for the smaller peak.

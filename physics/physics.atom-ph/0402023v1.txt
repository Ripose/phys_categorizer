We theoretically examine the neutral atom-molecule analogue of the anomalous quantum corre-
lations between degenerate electrons, i.e., Cooper pairs, that are responsible for superconductivity.
Based on rogue dissociation of triatomic molecules (trimers) into opposite-momentum pairs of atoms
and diatomic molecules (dimers) via a photoassociation or Feshbach resonance, we ﬁnd a superﬂuid
transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate of trimers dressed by atom-dimer Cooper pairs, at a critical
temperature in reach of present ultracold technology.

Exotic ultracold molecules are all the rage. For exam-
ple, there are prospects for quadratomic molecules via
photoassociation of ultracold polar molecules [1], and ev-
idence of forbidden molecular transitions in ultracold Ry-
dberg atoms [2]. Going colder to Bose-Einstein conden-
sates (BECs), there are opportunities for ampliﬁed selec-
tivity in photodissociation of triatomic molecules [3], and
mesoscopic molecular ions in BEC doped with an charged
impurity [4]. Lately this frenzy has surrounded ultra-
cold [5] and condensate [6] diatomic molecules emerging
from a Fermi sea of atoms.

In basic magnetoassociation, a molecule is created
when one atom from a colliding pair undergoes a spin
ﬂip in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld tuned near a Fes-
hbach resonance. A similar molecular state arises when
two atoms absorb a photon tuned near a photoassociation
resonance. The statistics of neutral molecules are deter-
mined by the number of neutrons in the nuclei of the
constituent atoms: odd for fermions, even for bosons.
Resonant association thus presents an unusual oppor-
tunity to change the particle statistics, leading to co-
operative fermion behavior. For example, a photoasso-
ciation [7] or Feshbach resonance [8] could deliver the
neutral-atom analogue of the anomalous quantum cor-
relations between electrons (Cooper pairs) responsible
for superconductivity [9, 10]. Magnetoassociation exper-
iments [5] are presently poised to realize this regime.

Meanwhile, attention is turning to resonant associa-
tion [11, 12] in Bose-Fermi mixtures of atoms [13], and
the subsequent atom-molecule Cooper pairing [14]. How-
ever, the most optimistic superﬂuid transition tempera-
ture is an order of magnitude below what is currently
feasible [14]. Based on rogue dissociation of triatomic
molecules (trimers) into opposite-momentum pairs of
atoms and diatomic molecules (dimers), we therefore re-
port a high-temperature superﬂuid transition to a Bose-
Einstein condensate of trimers dressed by atom-dimer
Cooper pairs. Upon diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we
present theory on the trimer-molecule binding energy and
the superﬂuid transition temperature. For 6Li atoms and

7Li-6Li dimers, the superﬂuid transition should occur at
about a tenth the atomic Fermi temperature.

In its simplest guise, the theory of collective res-
onant association is a two-mode model, analogous
to second-harmonic-generated photons, which couples
zero-momentum atomic and molecular condensates.
Rogue [15] transitions to the continuum of noncondensate
atomic modes [16] occur because dissociation of a zero-
momentum (k = 0) condensate molecule need not result
in zero-momentum condensate atoms, but may just as
well deliver two noncondensate atoms with equal and op-
k). Rogue dissociation ultimately
posite momentum (
leads to anomalous quantum correlations between atoms,
which are the analogue of Cooper pairs. An immediate
consequence of said correlations is Ramsey fringes be-
tween atoms and molecules [17]. The same intuition will
also prove useful here.

±

We model an ideal degenerate mixture of fermionic
atoms and dimer molecules coupled by either a Fes-
hbach or photoassociation resonance to bound trimer
molecules. An ideal gas is chosen mainly because oﬀ-
resonant particle-particle interactions are generally too
weak for practical purposes. The initial fermionic atom-
dimer state could be prepared using a Raman scheme
for photoassociating a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture of
atoms [14], and selectively removing the leftover bosons.
The atom-dimer
trimer resonance is expectedly well
resolved so that, once the initial atom-dimer state has
been created, transitions involving three free atoms are
avoided. In contrast to the all-boson case [3], ultracold
transitions that involve a free bosonic atom are Pauli
blocked, i.e., the two identical fermionic constituents of
a given trimer may not form a bound state.

In second-quantization parley, a particle of mass mσ
and momentum ~k is described by the creation opera-
tor ak,σ. The greek index corresponds mnemonically to
the number of constituent atoms a given particle con-
tains: 3 for bosonic trimers, 2 for fermionic dimers,
and 1 for fermionic atoms. All operators obey their
(anti)commutation relations. The microscopic Hamilto-

nian for such a freely-ideal system is written:

The free-particle energy is deﬁned by ~ǫk,σ = ~2k2/2mσ,
and the chemical potential by ~µσ.
In particular, the

where the bare detuning δ0 is a measure of the binding
energy of the trimer with δ0 > 0 taken as above threshold.

Since the contribution of rogue dissociation to resonant
association can be written as the set of all one-loop Feyn-
man diagrams, and since applying the canonical trans-
formation (3) is in fact equivalent to summing over that
set [10], then our generic intuition [15] is clearly applica-
ble. Broadly put, the lowest-energy conﬁguration of the
system is a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate dressed
by anomalously correlated pairs of equal and opposite
momentum. More precisely, sweeping the detuning con-
tinuously evolves this superposition from all trimers well
below threshold, to an admixture of trimers and atom-
dimer Cooper pairs near threshold, to all atom-dimer
Cooper pairs well above threshold.

To illustrate, consider the mean-ﬁeld Heisenberg equa-
tions for the bosonic operator a0,3 and the anomalous-
pair-correlation operator Ck = ak,1a−k,2 (sans chemical

Incidentally, we show elsewhere that the real

binding energy of 40K2 molecules, and similar measure-
ments for a system of trimers would uniquely determine
the parameters of the present theory. On the other side

critical temperature Tc ∼

To rigorously identify the critical temperature for the
superﬂuid transition, it is necessary to go beyond the
eﬀective atom-dimer theory, and explicitly include the
bosonic molecular state. Continuing to focus on a system
of 6Li atoms and 7Li-6Li dimers, we return to the Hamil-

molecular state, which can arise because large detuning
from one state brings the system into the neighborhood
of another bound state, or because of the presence of a
scattering resonance. The Hamiltonian (4) is adapted
simply by making the substitution δ0 →

FIG. 1: Onset of the superﬂuid transition to a Bose-Einstein
condensate of trimers dressed by anomalous atom-dimer pairs.
The non-zero superﬂuid gap clearly lowers the system energy
compared to the normal state (dashed curve). When the
detuning is large and positive (δ2
2), such as here,
the system is mostly rogue pairs with a negligible fraction of
trimers.

K

The algebraic system (9) is suﬃcient to numerically de-
termine the chemical potential as a function of tempera-
ture, which should display a characteristic cusp at the on-
set of superﬂuidity. Physically, a cusp arises because the
superﬂuid BEC-pair dressed state is lower in energy than
the normal state, implying the concurrent appearance of
a non-zero gap. This intuition is conﬁrmed in Fig. 1.
For positive detunings large compared to the collective-

trimer is puny (
s-wave collisional interactions are negligible compared to
the detuning, justifying the ideal-gas assumption. The
trap, albeit omitted, should actually favor the occurrence
of superﬂuid pairing [18].

[17]).

Dimer molecules created near a Feshbach resonance
are highly vibrationally excited and, thus, character-
istically long-range (K¨ohler et al.
Fermion-
composite dimers are consequently long-lived due to
Pauli-suppressed vibrational relaxation [19], and there
is no reason to expect otherwise from Feshbach trimer
states. In photoassociation, a two-color Raman scheme is
required to avoid spontaneous decay: a laser couples the
atoms to an electronically-excited intermediate trimer
state, a second laser couples the system to a ground-
electronic trimer manifold, and the intermediate trimer
state is well-detuned. Long-range states are available
with photoassociation, although a Raman scheme also al-
lows access to stable lower-lying vibrational levels, which
are much smaller and less understood. Nevertheless, the

molecular fraction is negligibly small when the system
is well above the appropriate threshold, diminishing the
chance for spontaneous for decay of any kind.

For a signature, note that Cooper pairing was sug-
gested to explain how nuclei with even numbers of nucle-
ons can have a larger excitation energy than nuclei with
odd numbers of nucleons [20]. The presence of anoma-
lous atom-dimer correlations should similarly blueshift
the resonant frequency of a dimer-dissociating photon
by an amount proportional to the gap, in contrast to
the otherwise [21] red-shifted photodissociation spectrum
(see also boson blueshift [22]). Physically, the increased
frequency comes about because, in order to dissociate a
dimer molecule, an extra amount of energy, speciﬁcally,
the gap energy, is needed to break any anomalous corre-
lations. If the dissociating light is weak enough to justify
lowest-order free-bound transitions, the blueshift should
dominate the redshift.

In conclusion, we reinforce the idea that statistics need
not be an issue in resonant association: each of the sys-
tems (Bose, Fermi, Bose-Fermi) is described by the same
basic Heisenberg equations of motion, and will respond
as a unit to form molecules in mostly-complete coopera-
tion. Moreover, while it is not entirely clear how many
constituents the association bound states may in prac-
tice contain, the limit is certainly not two. Granted,
at this stage it is diﬃcult to predict timescales, but in
this respect the quantum optics approach–based on ratios
of parameters not parameters–has a decided advantage.
When the detuning is large compared to the collectively
enhanced coupling, the superﬂuid transition to a BEC of
trimers dressed by atom-dimer Cooper pairs can occur
at about a tenth of the atomic Fermi temperature. A
molecular condensate of trimers could be the next mile-
stone, whereas high-temperature anomalous pairing be-
tween diﬀerent chemical species opens the door to further
analogies with condensed-matter and nuclear physics.

In preparation of this manuscript, magnetoassociation-

induced atomic Cooper pairing was observed [23].

Abstract

Highly precise variational calculations of non-relativistic energies of the (2p2)3P e

state of Helium atom are presented.We get an upper bound energy E = −0.71050015565678
a.u.,the lowest yet obtained.

1 Introduction

Multiply excited energy states in atoms have been the subject of many experimental and
theoretical investigations. Specially doubly excited states (DES) for neutral helium is
particularly important as the DES provide a fundamental testing ground of the accuracy
of the theoretical treatment. The review article of Holøien1 and F ano2 gives a detailed
list of references.
A large number of DES of neutral helium can auto-ionize to the continuum above the
1s(2S) ground state of He+. Besides, there are also non-auto-ionizing doubly excited
states in helium. These exactly quantized DES states decay to the lower excited states
through electric dipole interaction giving rise to sharp spectral line.
It is worthwhile
to mention that relativistically these states may auto-ionize, but the auto-ionization life
times are still appreciably longer than the mean radiative life times of the allowed electric
dipole transition1.
Compton and Boyce3, Kruger4, W hiddington and P riestley5 are the pioneers to observe
such exactly quantized DES of helium. Among such non-auto-ionizing doubly excited lev-
els in helium, the (2p2)3P e state is the lowest lying P-state of even parity. The interpre-
tation of 320.392A0 line in helium as the (2p2)3P e → (1s2p)3P 0-transition by Kruger4
was later conﬁrmed by W u6 on the basis of theoretical calculation. T ech and W ard7

reinvestigated the matter and performed highly accurate spectroscopic measurement of
the line 2p2(3P e) → (1s2p)3P 0 at 320.2926 ± 0.0010A0. A discrepancy of about 100cm−1
between the measurements of T ech.et.al7 and that of Kruger4 is due to the unavailability
of accurate standard wave-lengths at the time of measurement of Kruger4. Berry et.al8
also observed the line 2p2(3P e) → 1s2p(3P 0) at 320.40 ± 0.3A0.
Drake and Dalgarno9, Holøien10, Bhatia11 calculated the energy of the (2p2)3P e- state of
helium by using variational method. Using variational perturbation method Aashamar12
obtained the accurate eigenvalue for the (2p2)3P e- state of neutral helium. All these the-
oretical investigations predicted the wave length of 2p2(3P e) → 1s2p(3P 0) transition of
helium range from 320.288 to 320.293A0, and hence are in agreement with the measure-
ment of T ech et.al7
Under such circumstances it is necessary to perform very accurate spectroscopic calcula-
tion of the (2p2)3P e-state of helium. In this article, we propose a method to improve the
DES wave function to get not only the best upper bound energy but also rapid convergence
with respect to the size of the trial space.

2 Theory

The rotational invariance of the Hamiltonian makes it possible to express the variational
equation of two electrons in the ﬁeld of a ﬁxed nucleus in terms of three independent
variables13.The three coordinates are the sides of the triangle formed by the three particles
i.e., two electrons and the ﬁxed nucleus. The reduction of the three Eulerian angles,
deﬁning the orientation of this triangle in space, from the variational equation is an
immediate consequence of the spherical symmetry of the ﬁeld. For any 3P - state of
even parity arising from two equivalent electrons, the general variational equation (10) of
Ref.13 reduces to

3 Results

The results of our calculation are given in T able1. All calculations were carried out in
quadruple precision. The orbital exponents ρ1 and ρ2 were optimized using the Nelder −
Mead14 procedure and are given in T able1.
There are other variational calculations9−11 of the (2p2)3P e-states for Helium. So far best
result was obtained by Bhatia11. A comparison of present results to that of Bhatia11 is
given in T able1. The total number of terms (N) for each calculation is given in the ﬁrst col-
umn. The results obtained by Bhatia11 in second column are compared with the present
results in the last column. It’s remarkable that for a given number of term (N) the results
of the present basis sets are better than that of Bhatia11 for next largest basis set e.g.
our result for 21 parameter calculation is better than that of 35 parameter calculation of
Bhatia11, again our 84 parameter result is better than the 97 parameter result of Bhatia11
as is evident from T able1. Substantial reduction of the number of terms i.e. the basis set
size is a clear advantage of the present method for a given calculated energy value. It is
relevant to mention that using variational-perturbation technique Aashamar12 obtained
the non-relativistic energy for (2p2)3P e- state of helium as 0.71050015560a.u.. Present
variational results of 0.710500155678a.u. is even slightly lower than that of variational-
perturbation results12.
T ech et. al7 observed the sharp line in far ultra-violet region with wave number 312, 214.52±
0.97 cm−1 corresponding to a wavelength 320.2926 ± 0.0010 A0. In order to compare with
experiment, we use the well known experimental15 line with wave number 169, 087.01 ±
0.15cm−1 corresponding to the transition (1s2p)3P 0 → 1s2(1S). Adding the wave number
of the above two lines, an experimental value of 481, 301.53 ± 0.98cm−1 for the energy of
the doubly excited (2p2)3P e term relative to the ground (1s2)1S results. Similarly, com-
bining the observation of Kruger4 and the experiment of Martin15, an experimental value
of 481, 205cm−1 for the energy of the (2p2)3P e-term relative to the ground 1s2(1S) results.
It is clear that there is a discrepancy of approximately 100cm−1 between the experimental
results of Kruger4 and T ech7. We obtained the position of the (2p2)3P e-state above the
ground 1s2(1S0)-state by subtracting our calculated energy for the (2p2)3P e-state from the
well known7 energy −637, 219.54cm−1 of the ground 1s2(1S0) state of helium. The conver-
sion factor 1a.u. = 219, 444.528cm−1 is used. Our calculated value of 481, 304.17cm−1 for
the energy of (2p2)3P e-state above the ground (1s2)1S0-state is far from the experimental
value of 481, 205cm−1 of Krugar4, but agrees fairly well with the experimental value of
481, 301.53 ± 0.98cm−1 of T ech et.al.7. Aashamar obtained a value of 481, 301.62cm−1
for the same including mass polarization, relativistic and radiative eﬀects. A diﬀerence
of approximately 3cm−1 between our non-relativistic results and that of Aashamar or
experiment is due to relativistic and other correction.
Finally taking the diﬀerence between the present calculated wave number 481, 304.17cm−1

In the above manuscript, there was an error in the numeric computation [based on Eqs. (6) and (7)] predicting the
time-dependent alkali vapor density n(t) and number of alkali atoms in the paraﬃn coating Nc(t). Once the error in
the computation was remedied, it was necessary to adjust two parameters [ρ (probability for adsorption of atoms by
the paraﬃn coating per wall collision) and ξ (exchange rate between atoms in the stem of the cell and the volume
of the cell)] in order to obtain the same agreement between the theory and the data as seen in Figs. 9 and 10. This
modiﬁes the results for ρ and ξ listed in Table II as follows:

TABLE II: Average values of various light-independent parameters from the model extracted from ﬁts to the data from Secs. III
B, III C, and III D.

2(1) × 10

4(2) × 10

Therefore the average over all data for ρ should be 4(1) × 10−6. This in fact improves agreement with the values
of ρ determined in other work [1, 2, 3, 4], in which ρ was found to be between ∼ 10−6 and ∼ 3 × 10−6. This in turn
means that the number of atoms estimated to be in the coating Nc should be larger by a factor of about 30 [see, for
example, Eq. (9)]. This would correspondingly change the scale of the lower plots in Figs. 9 and 10.

The adjustment to the value for ξ changes our estimate of the number of atoms adsorbed by the coating during
the “ripening” process to ∼ 1017, but this in no way changes our conclusion that the number of atoms available for
desorption is considerably smaller than the number of atoms absorbed during cell ripening.

We are deeply indebted to A. I. Okunevich for bringing this mistake to our attention.

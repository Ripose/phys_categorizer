We study elastic collisions in an optically trapped spin mixture of fermionic lithium atoms in the
presence of magnetic ﬁelds up to 1.5 kG by measuring evaporative loss. Our experiments conﬁrm
the expected magnetic tunability of the scattering length by showing the main features of elastic
scattering according to recent calculations. We measure the zero crossing of the scattering length
that is associated with a predicted Feshbach resonance at 530(3) G. Beyond the resonance we observe
the expected large cross section in the triplet scattering regime.

In an ultracold atomic gas, the s-wave scattering length
a characterizes the elastic interactions and is therefore an
especially interesting parameter to manipulate. Changes
of a have a profound eﬀect on the dynamics of the gas
and on its thermodynamic stability. For spin mixtures of
fermionic atoms, the scattering length governs the stabil-
ity and critical temperature of a Cooper-paired superﬂuid
phase. The scattering length can be conveniently tuned
if it depends on the magnetic ﬁeld, as is the case near a
Feshbach resonance. For bosonic atoms, such resonances
have been observed [1, 2, 3], and used for attainment and
manipulation of a BEC in 85Rb [4] and for the production
of bright solitons in bosonic 7Li [5, 6].

For fermionic gases, Loftus et al. have recently ob-
served a Feshbach resonance between two diﬀerent spin
states of 40K, which changes scattering properties in a
narrow magnetic ﬁeld range [7]. The other fermionic
species currently used in several experiments, 6Li, is pre-
dicted to have a very broad Feshbach resonance which
completely changes the character of interactions in a wide
experimentally accessible ﬁeld range. Magnetic-ﬁeld tun-
ing of elastic scattering at small ﬁelds far below the res-
onance was recently used by Granade et al. to obtain a
suﬃcient scattering cross section for the all-optical pro-
duction of a degenerate Fermi gas of lithium [8]. At
higher magnetic ﬁelds, an expected extreme tunability
promises great prospects to observe new phenomena, e.g.
in Cooper pairing [9, 10], cold molecule formation [11]
and studies of Fermi gases in reduced dimensionality [12].

In this Letter, we experimentally explore the mag-
netic tunability of elastic scattering in a spin-mixture
of fermionic lithium atoms in high magnetic ﬁelds up to
1.5 kG. Our results verify the expected dependence of the
cross section that follows from theoretical calculations of
the scattering length [13, 14, 15]. As a particular feature
associated with a predicted Feshbach resonance [13], we

observe the zero crossing of the scattering length that
occurs at a ﬁeld of 530 G. The exact location of this fea-
ture is of great interest as a sensitive input parameter
to better constrain the uncertainty in the molecular po-
tentials for more accurate theoretical calculations of the
scattering properties of 6Li. Our measurements of elas-
tic collisions are based on evaporation out of an optical
dipole trap. We use an optical standing-wave trap devel-
oped earlier [16], which employs the power enhancement
inside an optical resonator to create a deep trap with
a suﬃciently large volume to capture a large number of
lithium atoms.

The scattering properties in diﬀerent spin-mixtures of
fermionic lithium atoms were theoretically investigated
by Houbiers et al. [13], Kokkelmans et al. [14], and Ven-

turi and Williams [15]. Magnetic tunability, of particular
interest for Cooper pairing in a Fermi gas [9, 10], was
predicted for the stable combination of the two lowest
states |1i and |2i; at low magnetic ﬁeld these states corre-
spond to F = 1/2, mF = +1/2 and mF = −1/2, respec-
tively. Most prominently, a broad Feshbach resonance is
expected to mark the transition from the low-ﬁeld scat-
tering regime to the high-ﬁeld region. In more detail, the
s-wave scattering length a(B) is expected to show the
following behavior: After being zero in the absence of a
magnetic ﬁeld, a local maximum of |a(B)| occurs with
rising ﬁeld at ∼300 G with a ≈ −300 a0, where a0 is the
Bohr radius. Then, as a precursor of the Feshbach res-
onance, the scattering length crosses zero in the range
between 500 G and 550 G. After passing through the res-
onance somewhere between 800 G and 850 G scattering in
higher ﬁelds is dominated by the triplet potential with a
very large and negative scattering length. The available
theoretical data [13, 14, 15] show the same behavior for
a(B) within some variations due to the limited knowledge
of the molecular interaction parameters. Fig. 1(a) illus-
trates these predictions for the scattering length a(B) by
a corresponding model curve [21] that approximates the
results of Refs. [13, 14, 15].

In a cold gas at ﬁnite temperature the cross section for
elastic scattering of non-identical particles is unitarity-
limited to a maximum value of σmax = 4π/k2, where
k = mv/(2¯h) is the wavenumber corresponding to a rela-
tive velocity v and a reduced mass m/2. Taking into ac-
count the B-ﬁeld dependent scattering length a(B) and
the unitarity limit, the resulting B-ﬁeld dependent cross
section can be written as σ = 4πa2/(1 + k2a2). For the
considered |1i − |2i spin mixture of 6Li the expected be-
havior of the cross section is shown in Fig. 1(b) for the
example of a wave number k = (300 a0)−1 close to our
experimental conditions. Most notably, as a consequence
of the unitarity limit in combination with the very large
scattering length for high magnetic ﬁelds, the Feshbach
resonance does not appear as a pronounced feature in the
cross section. The zero crossing of the scattering length,
however, leads to a vanishing scattering cross section and
thus shows up as a manifestation of the resonance.

The resonator-enhanced dipole trap (REDT) [16]
makes use of the enhancement of the laser intensity inside
a linear optical resonator to create a large and deep trap-
ping volume for lithium atoms. The power provided by a
2-W Nd:YAG laser (Innolight Mephisto-2000) at a wave-
length of 1064 nm is enhanced by a factor of 120 to create
a far red-detuned 1D optical lattice trap with an axial
period of 532 nm and a transverse 1/e-radius of 115 µm.
The maximum trap depth is of the order of 1 mK. To
vary the trap depth the resonator-internal power is servo-
controlled by an acousto-optical modulator in the inci-
dent laser beam. From a standard magneto-optical trap
(MOT) operated with diode lasers we typically transfer
5 × 105 6Li atoms into roughly 1000 individual wells at

ﬁeld range. The data points show the measured number of
atoms remaining in the trap after 1 s (◦) and 3 s (•) of plain

a temperature of ∼ 400µK. The resulting peak density is
∼ 1.5 × 1011 cm−3. By extinguishing the repumping light
of the MOT 1 ms before the main trapping light is turned
oﬀ, all atoms are pumped into the two states |1i and |2i
to create the desired spin mixture.

The magnetic ﬁeld is produced by a pair of water-
cooled coils outside of the glas vacuum cell of the trap.
At a maximum continuous operation current of 200 A the
coils produce a magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 kG with a curvature
of only 75 G/cm2 along the symmetry axis; the corre-
sponding power dissipation is 6 kW. The set-up allows for
a maximum ramp speed of 5 G/ms within the full range.
The magnetic ﬁeld is calibrated by radio-frequency in-
duced transitions from |2i to the state that at B = 0
corresponds to F = 3/2, mF = +1/2. The latter is
unstable against inelastic collisions with |2i which leads
to easily detectable loss. With a ﬁt to the Breit-Rabi
formula we obtain a calibration of the magnetic ﬁeld to
better than 1 G over the full range.

The basic idea of our measurements is to observe elastic
collisions through evaporative loss at a variable magnetic
ﬁeld [17]. Our trap is initially loaded under conditions
where the eﬀective temperature T of a truncated Boltz-
mann distribution [18] is only slightly below the trap
depth U . A strongly non-thermal distribution is thus cre-
ated with a small truncation parameter η = U/kBT ≈ 2.
The thermal relaxation resulting from elastic collisions
then leads to rapid evaporative loss and cooling of the
sample, i.e. an increase of η. The trap depth can be
kept constant to study plain evaporation or, alternatively,
ramped down to force the evaporation process.

In a series of plain evaporation experiments performed
at a constant trap depth of 750 µK we measure evapora-
tive loss over the maximum accesible range of magnetic
ﬁelds up to 1.5 kG. After a ﬁxed holding time the remain-

ing atoms are retrapped into the MOT and their number
is measured via the ﬂourescence signal by a calibrated
photodiode. The loss signal is recorded for holding times
of 1 s and 3 s corresponding to the time scale of evapora-
tion. These holding times are short compared with the
rest-gas limited lifetime of 30 s. Fig. 2 shows the result
of 1000 diﬀerent measurements obtained in an acquisi-
tion time of six hours. The data points are taken in a
random sequence for 31 magnetic ﬁeld values equally dis-
tributed over the full range. Data points for 1 s and 3 s are
recorded alternatingly. This way of data taking ensures
that the signal is not inﬂuenced by residual long-term
drifts of the experimental conditions.

The observed evaporation loss in Fig. 2 shows a pro-
nounced dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld which is to be
compared with the expected cross section for elastic col-
lisions as displayed in Fig. 1(b). After being very small
at low magnetic ﬁelds, the loss increases for ﬁelds up
to ∼350 G where an expected local maximum of evap-
orative loss is observed. The loss then decreases and
disappears at about 530 G as a consequence of the pre-
dicted zero crossing of the scattering length. Here the
slight observed loss in the 1 s curve is explained by the

ramping time some evaporation does already take place.
At 530 G the decrease of the trapped atom number be-
tween 1 s and 3 s is fully explained by rest gas losses with-
out any further evaporation. For higher magnetic ﬁelds
evaporative loss rapidly rises until it levels oﬀ at about
700 G. Up to the maximum attainable value of 1.5 kG
high evaporation loss is observed. A slight decrease of
the atom number for ﬁelds exceeding 1 kG occurs which
we attribute to technical reasons; we observe an increas-
ing noise for currents higher than ∼130 A in the error
signal of the resonator lock of the REDT. The relatively
large and constant evaporative loss for ﬁelds exceeding
700 G is consistent with the predicted behavior of the
cross section.

The evaporative cooling eﬀect is conﬁrmed by mea-
suring the change of the truncation parameter η after
3 s of trapping at selected values of the magnetic ﬁeld.
For thermometry we turn oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld to avoid
further elastic collisions and adiabatically lower the trap
depth in a 1-s exponential ramp. The fraction of re-
maining atoms as a function of the relative depth then
provides a good measure of η. At the zero-crossing at
530 G we observe only a slight increase of η to a value of
2.3(2) which is explained by the unavoidable evaporation
during the magnetic ﬁeld ramps. At 340 G close to the
local maximum of |a| we ﬁnd an increase of η to 4.2(3)
as a clear evidence of evaporative cooling. At 720 G, i.e.
in the case of a large positive scattering length, a higher
value of 5.5(2) is measured showing deeper evaporative
cooling. Essentially the same η of 5.3(2) is obtained at
B = 1290 G where scattering takes place in the triplet-
dominated regime with a very large negative scattering

conditions as the in Fig. 2 for a holding time of 3s. Here

length.

The observed behavior is in agreement with a Monte-
Carlo simulation taking into account the unitarity limi-
tation of the cross section [19]. The results conﬁrm the
observed evaporation time scales and the attained values
of η. We also ﬁnd that collisions ejecting atoms out of the
trap take place with a mean energy of ∼ 350µK which cor-
responds to an eﬀective wave number of k ≈ (300 a0)−1.
We measure the minimum-loss feature in a closer range
of magnetic ﬁelds to precisely determine the value of the
magnetic ﬁeld at which the zero crossing of scattering
length occurs. The main data points in Fig. 3 are ob-
tained with 500 individual measurements at a holding
time of 3 s with the magnetic ﬁeld randomly varied be-
tween 30 values in an interval between 370 G and 670 G;
the data shown in the inset are obtained with 1000 mea-
surements in the very narrow range between 520 G and
544 G. The results allow us to determine the B-ﬁeld for
minimum evaporative loss, and thus the zero-crossing of
the scattering length to 530(3) G.

Forced evaporation measurements provide complemen-
tary data to plain evaporation and allow us to rule out
a signiﬁcant role of inelastic collisions. When the trap
depth is ramped down, elastic collisions reduce trap loss
in contrast to increased loss at constant trap depth. This
can be understood by the spilling loss of energetic par-
ticles [18]: Without elastic collisions the most energetic
particles are spilled out of the trap when its depth is
reduced. With elastic collisions the evaporative cooling
eﬀect decreases the temperature and thus reduces the
spilling loss.

In our forced evaporation measurements we reduce the
trap depth in 10 s to 20% of its initial value in an ex-
ponential ramp and measure the number of remaining

together with the large cross section observed for higher
ﬁelds provides clear evidence of the predicted Feshbach
resonance. Moreover it enables more precise calculations
of the 6Li scattering properties. The resonance itself is
masked by unitarity-limited scattering and requires much
deeper evaporative cooling for a direct observation. The
fact that we do not see any signiﬁcant eﬀect of inelastic
loss highlights that the extremely large positive and neg-
ative scattering lengths attainable with fermionic lithium
oﬀer intriguing new possibilities for experiments on inter-
acting Fermi gases.

Note added: Shortly before submission of the present
manuscript we learned about measurements of the group
of J.E. Thomas on the zero crossing of the scattering
length which agree with our data.

atoms; the results are displayed in Fig. 4. At reduced
laser power of the REDT the magnetic ﬁeld has to be
restricted to 1 kG because of an increasing sensitivity of
the resonator lock to current-dependent noise. A mini-
mum number of atoms is now measured at 0 G and 530 G
instead of the maximum observed with constant trap
depth. The largest number of atoms is observed in the
high-ﬁeld region above 650 G as expected for the large
scattering cross section.

In Ref. [20] inelastic collisions in 6Li were studied at
a temperature of ∼20 µK. A magnetic ﬁeld dependent
loss was observed around 680 Gauss, with evidence of
an inelastic two-body process. To measure the loss rate
under our conditions of higher temperature and much
lower density we study the long-time evolution of sam-
ples which are pre-cooled by forced evaporation and then
recompressed into a 750 µK deep trap to a temperature
of ∼150 µK and a density of 5×1010 cm−3. The magnetic
ﬁeld during the 60-s holding time is alternated for suc-
cessive data points between 680 G and 300 G, the latter
value corresponding to a very low loss rate in Ref. [20].
We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the number of re-
maining atoms, which leads to a clear upper bound to
the two-body rate constant of 1 × 10−12 cm3/s. This up-
per bound is lower than the value of 2 × 10−12 cm3/s of
Ref. [20], whereas for a process involving higher partial
waves one would expect the rate to increase with tem-
perature. From our upper bound for inelastic loss and
the measured values for η we infer that the ratio of good-
to-bad collisions at very large positive and negative scat-
tering length clearly exceeds 1000. Thus excellent condi-
tions for evaporative cooling towards degeneracy can be
expected near the Feshbach resonance.

In conclusion, our measurements conﬁrm the predicted
magnetic tunability of the s-wave scattering length in
a spin-mixture of fermionic lithium atoms in the whole
magnetic ﬁeld range of experimental interest. The ob-
served zero crossing of the scattering length at 530(3) G

We demonstrate the ability to coherently control ultracold atomic Rb collisions using frequency-
chirped light on the nanosecond time scale. For certain center frequencies of the chirp, the rate of
inelastic trap-loss collisions induced by negatively chirped light is dramatically suppressed compared
to the case of a positive chirp. We attribute this to a fundamental asymmetry in the system: an
excited wavepacket always moves inward on the attractive molecular potential. For a positive chirp,
the resonance condition moves outward in time, while for a negative chirp, it moves inward, in the
same direction as the excited wavepacket; this allows multiple interactions between the wavepacket
and the light, enabling the wavepacket to be returned coherently to the ground state. Classical and
quantum calculations support this interpretation.

Traditionally, the ﬁelds of ultracold physics [1] and
short-pulse coherent control [2, 3] have followed inde-
pendent paths. Besides the obvious incompatibility
of sub-picosecond timescales with the motion of slow
atoms, cooling typically deals with translational de-
grees of freedom while coherent control involves inter-
nal degrees of freedom. A potentially fruitful collabo-
rative venture is the production of ultracold molecules
by coherently-controlled photoassociation of ultracold
atoms. Despite many theoretical proposals on this topic
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], experiments to date [12, 13]
have demonstrated coherent control of only the photo-
destruction of ultracold molecules, not of their collisional
formation. Here we describe our use of frequency-chirped
light on the nanosecond timescale [14] to coherently con-
trol ultracold collisions in Rb. We observe signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the collision rates for the two chirp direc-
tions. For the negative chirp, a wavepacket excited to
the attractive molecular potential can subsequently be
returned coherently to the ground state, thereby reduc-
ing the collision rate.

Ultracold molecules [15] are of signiﬁcant current in-
terest due to potential applications in a variety of ﬁelds:
ultracold chemistry, quantum computing, novel quantum
degenerate systems, and tests of fundamental symme-
tries. One method of ultracold molecule production is
photoassociation [16], where two ultracold atoms collide
in the presence of laser light and undergo a free-to-bound
transition to form an excited molecule. Spontaneous
emission can subsequently produce ultracold molecules
in the electronic ground state, but typically in a distribu-
tion of high vibrational levels. If the entire process could
be done coherently, it might be possible to populate a

single deeply-bound ground-state level. The techniques
of coherent control would be useful here, since the abil-
ity to control in detail the phase and amplitude of short
pulses would allow optimizing the various steps in con-
verting pairs of free atoms into ultracold molecules in a
particular quantum state. In this letter, we investigate
the closely-related phenomenon of ultracold atomic col-
lisions [17], speciﬁcally excited-state collisions resulting
in trap loss. We induce these collisions with pulses of
frequency-chirped light (see Fig. 1) and observe a strong
dependence on the chirp direction. We attribute this
diﬀerence to a fundamental asymmetry in the system
[18]: the atom pair always moves inward on the attractive
excited-state potential. Only for the negative chirp does
the resonance condition also move inward, resulting in

the possibility of multiple interactions between the atom
pair (or collisional wavepacket) and the laser ﬁeld.

The long-range interaction between ground- and
excited-state atoms, separated by R, is dominated by
-C3/R3. Laser light
the dipole-dipole interaction [19]:
detuned from the atomic resonance by ∆(∆<0) can ex-
cite the atom pair to an attractive potential at the Con-
don radius Rc = (-C3/~∆)1/3, where the photon energy
matches the potential energy diﬀerence. The initially ul-
tracold atoms accelerate on the attractive potential and
can gain suﬃcient energy (e.g., by predissociation from
a short-range curve crossing) to escape from the trap.
We investigate these trap-loss collisions by chirping over
a range of frequencies, thus exciting over a range of R.
We have previously shown that this chirped excitation
can be adiabatic and eﬃcient [14] and that there can
be cooperative eﬀects, both enhancement and depletion,
between successive chirps [20]. In the present work, we
examine the dependence of these collisions on the center
detuning ∆c of the chirp and on its direction. We ob-
serve rather diﬀerent behaviors for positive and negative
chirps. This is interpreted in terms of single interactions
for the positive chirp versus multiple, in some cases co-
herent, interactions for the negative chirp. Classical and
quantum calculations support this viewpoint.

We measure the trap-loss collisional rate constant β
by monitoring the density-dependent decay of a sample
of ultracold (∼50 µK) 85Rb atoms in a magneto-optical
trap (MOT) [14]. Excited-state trap-loss collisions are
induced by 40 ns FWHM frequency-chirped pulses with
±10 GHz/µs chirp rate and 70 W/cm2 peak intensity.
This chirped light is produced with an external-cavity
diode laser whose current is rapidly ramped and whose
output is used to injection-lock a separate free-running
diode laser [21]. The desired portion of each chirp is
selected with an acousto-optical modulator. With the
MOT light turned oﬀ for 150 µs, a number (typically 60)
of these chirped pulses is applied at a repetition rate of
1.7 MHz. This entire cycle is repeated every 722 µs. The
MOT repumping light is left on continuously in order
to correct any possible optical pumping caused by the
chirped light. Results for β at various values of ∆c and
for both chirp directions are shown in Fig. 2. There are
clearly signiﬁcant diﬀerences between collisions induced
with positive and negative chirps.

Focusing ﬁrst on the positive chirps, we see a smooth
increase in βpos with ∆c. This is consistent with adi-
abatic excitation, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. A sample
atom-pair trajectory from our classical Monte-Carlo sim-
ulations (discussed below) is shown, together with Rc as
a function of time. For the positive chirp, Rc increases
with time, while the atom-pair separation R decreases.
Excitation can occur when the two curves intersect. Be-
cause R and Rc diverge after the excitation, there are no
further interactions between the atom pair and the light.

points) and negative (open points) frequency chirps.

2), as ∆c approaches zero, the range of Rc swept out by
the chirp increases, resulting in more pairs available for
excitation. The collision rate remains ﬁnite because for
large Rc, the excited-state potential is very ﬂat and it
is unlikely that an atom pair will gain suﬃcient energy
to escape before spontaneous emission occurs. For posi-
tive values of ∆c, βpos drops sharply because there is no
longer excitation to the attractive potential.

Turning now to negative chirps, we see a more dra-
matic variation of β with ∆c. In the range -1500 MHz
to -1000 MHz, βneg is slightly below βpos, but behaves
similarly.
In this regime, the excited-state potential is
steep and atomic motion is fast on the time scale of the
chirp. This minimizes the possibility for further inter-
actions with the light, similar to the case of adiabatic
excitation by the positive chirp.

Between -1000 MHz and -500 MHz, βneg is signiﬁcantly
suppressed relative to βpos. Here, the time scales for the
chirp and atom-pair motion on the excited potential are
similar, so further interactions are possible. In particu-
lar, the excited atom pair can be stimulated back to the
ground state by a second interaction with the light, eﬀec-
tively turning oﬀ the collision. An example of this colli-
sion blocking is shown in Fig. 3b. Since stimulated emis-
sion, as opposed to spontaneous emission, is involved,
this process is coherent in nature.

In the range ∆c/2π = -500 MHz and 0 MHz, βneg
shows a strong peak. We attribute this to ﬂux enhance-
ment, as shown in Fig. 3c. Here a pair is excited at
long range early in the chirp, but undergoes spontaneous
emission to the ﬂat ground-state potential before gain-
ing signiﬁcant kinetic energy. The pair is then re-excited
later in the chirp, this time at short range, where the
acceleration is suﬃciently strong to cause trap loss. The
increased collision rate is due to the attractive interaction
funneling collisional ﬂux in from long range and making
it available for excitation at short range [22]. This ﬂux

Each plot shows the atomic separation R vs. t. The thin and
thick lines indicate that the atom pair is on the ground- or
excited-state potential, respectively. Also shown is the Con-
don radius Rc (dashed line), which varies with time due to
the chirp. The 40 ns FWHM chirped pulses are centered at t
= 50 ns. (a) Adiabatic transfer for the positive chirp, ∆c/2π

enhancement is incoherent in nature since spontaneous
emission is involved.

To model the collisions and gain insight into the phys-
ical mechanisms involved, we have performed both clas-
sical and quantum calculations. We ﬁrst discuss the
Monte-Carlo simulations, where the atomic motion is
treated classically. Sample classical trajectories have al-
ready been shown in Fig. 3. The initial conditions (rel-
ative position vector and relative velocity vector) for an
atom pair on the ground-state potential (assumed ﬂat)
are chosen randomly, in accord with a 50 µK temper-
ature and a uniform density. This pair is then subject
to the frequency-chirped pulse. When the instantaneous
frequency coincides with the local resonant frequency of
the pair (i.e., when Rc=R), the Landau-Zener probability
+ attractive molecular potential
for excitation to the 0u
[19] is calculated.
If the pair is excited, it accelerates
on the attractive potential until a random spontaneous
emission occurs, which returns it to the ground state.

FIG. 4: (a) Classical simulations of β vs. ∆c/2π for the
positive chirp (solid line), for the negative chirp (dashed line),
and for the negative chirp with ﬂux enhancement artiﬁcially
excluded (dotted line). The shaded region indicates where
stimulated emission dominates over spontaneous emission for
the negative chirp. (b) Quantum calculations of trap loss vs.
∆c for positive (solid line) and negative (dotted line) chirps.

If the atom pair arrives at short range (R<100 a0) in
the excited state, that trajectory is counted as a trap-
loss event. If local resonance occurs again after the ini-
tial excitation (which can only happen for the negative
chirp), the Landau-Zener transition probability is again
calculated. If the atom pair is still in the excited state,
this second laser-induced transition is stimulated emis-
sion back to ground state, while if the pair has decayed
back to the ground state in the mean time, this second
laser-induced transition is another excitation, placing the
pair back on the attractive potential and giving it another
chance to collide. The former case (stimulated emission)
results in coherent collision blocking, while the latter case
gives ﬂux enhancement. A large number (e.g., 2x105) of
trajectories are run and the fraction resulting in trap loss
is a measure of the relative value of β.

In Fig. 4a, we present the dependence of βpos and
βneg on ∆c. The overall trends of the data (Fig. 2) are
reproduced rather well, especially considering the simpli-
ﬁcations in the model, notably the assumption of a single
excited potential and the neglect of hyperﬁne structure.
βpos shows a smooth dependence on ∆c with a rather
ﬂat region between -500 MHz and 0 MHz. βneg is similar
to βpos in the range <-1000 MHz. For intermediate de-
tunings, -1000 MHz to -500 MHz, the simulations show a
suppression of βneg relative to βpos, as seen in the data.
For small negative detunings, the ﬂux enhancement peak
is reproduced. To demonstrate that the suppression is
due to coherent processes, we examined individual tra-

4

jectories to determine the mechanism by which the atom
pair was returned to the ground state following the ini-
tial excitation. Stimulated emission indicates coherent
collision blocking (Fig. 3b) while spontaneous emission
indicates ﬂux enhancement (Fig. 3c). The ratio of stim-
ulated to spontaneous events exceeds unity in the shaded
area, showing that this suppression region is clearly dom-
inated by coherent collision blocking.

To estimate the trap loss quantum mechanically, we in-
voke the two-channel approximation and use the Cheby-
chev polynomial expansion [23] with the mapped Fourier
grid method [24] to solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation for ψg/e, the ground/excited electronic radial
wave functions for a pair of atoms. In the rotating-wave-
approximation, the dressed-state Hamiltonian is given by

evolves. In both cases, the interaction is coherent.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated coherent control
of ultracold collisions with frequency-chirped light. For
certain parameters, the collision rate is dramatically sup-
pressed simply by switching the chirp direction from pos-
itive to negative. We interpret this suppression as due
to multiple coherent interactions between the collisional
wavepacket and the light as the wavepacket and the res-
onance condition both propagate inward. Using faster
time scales and larger detunings, it should be possible
to form vibrational wavepackets by chirped photoassoci-
ation, an important step towards the controlled produc-
tion of ground-state molecules. Incorporation of shaped
pulses in lieu of simple linear chirps will allow further
control and optimization of speciﬁc processes.

the chirp. The light-induced coupling is ~Ω=µE0exp[-
(t/2σ)2±iνchirpt2], where µ is the transition dipole mo-
ment, E0 is the peak ﬁeld amplitude, σ is the temporal
width of the pulse, and ±νchirp is the chirp rate. The ini-
tial state ψg(t→-∞) is taken to be the zero energy s-wave
scattering eigenstate of ˆV g[10]. Contributions to the loss
from higher partial waves are found to be negligible. To
model the trap loss, we add absorbing boundary condi-
tions at the inner part (R = 100 a0) of the excited-state
potential. Any ﬂux crossing the boundary is assumed to
undergo an inelastic trap-loss collision. To account for
spontaneous decay, we couple the excited-state channel
irreversibly to an artiﬁcial sink channel with character-
istic lifetime Γ−1 = 22 ns [19]. Note that in this model,
multiple incoherent re-excitations are forbidden, and ﬂux
enhancement does not appear. The dynamics are calcu-
lated separately for the triplet and singlet ground elec-
tronic states, adjusting each of the initial states with the
proper scattering length [25]. Assuming that the MOT
provides unpolarized atoms, the total loss rate is a simple
3:1 statistical sum of the triplet and singlet loss rates.

The results of the fully quantum calculations for both
chirp directions are shown in Fig. 4b. Since ﬂux enhance-
ment cannot occur in the quantum calculations, in order
to more fairly compare with the classical calculations, we
also show in Fig. 4a the classical result with ﬂux enhance-
ment trajectories artiﬁcially excluded. With this modiﬁ-
cation, the trends are in reasonable agreement. At large
negative detunings, βpos and βneg converge, while at in-
termediate detunings, βneg is signiﬁcantly suppressed. In
the classical picture this is due to stimulated emission of
the localized atom-pair, while in the quantum picture,
the nonlocalized collisional wavepacket undergoes a pro-
longed interaction with the negatively-chirped light as it

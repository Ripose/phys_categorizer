We report extensions and corrections to the measurement of the Feshbach resonance in 85Rb
cold atom collisions reported earlier [J. L. Roberts et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5109 (1998)]. In
addition to a better determination of the position of the resonance peak (154.9(4) gauss) and its
width (11.0(4) gauss), improvements in our techniques now allow the measurement of the absolute
size of the elastic scattering rate. This provides a new measure of the s-wave scattering length
as a function of magnetic ﬁeld near the Feshbach resonance and constrains the Rb-Rb interaction
potential.

The presence of a Feshbach resonance in cold atomic collisions allows the elastic and inelastic collision properties
to be dramatically altered as an external ﬁeld is changed [1]. In particular, the s-wave scattering length (a), which
completely characterizes elastic scattering in ultracold collisions, can be tuned over a large range. In 1998, several
groups reported the observation of external-magnetic-ﬁeld Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions in 85Rb [2,3]
and in 23Na [4]. These tunable interactions have been used to study the stability [5] and dynamics [6] of 85Rb BECs
with attractive interactions. Interpreting the results of these recent studies and other future studies in 85Rb requires
a more accurate knowledge of a as a function of magnetic ﬁeld (B) near the Feshbach resonance than that obtained
in Ref. [2]. In order to improve the accuracy of the determination of a versus B, we extended and improved the
measurements performed in Ref. [2].

The cold collision Rb-Rb interatomic potential and hence the s-wave scattering length vs. magnetic ﬁeld is char-
acterized primarily by three parameters: the triplet scattering length, aT ; the singlet scattering length, aS; and the
C6 van der Waals coeﬃcient [7,8]. In our previous work, we measured two characteristics of the prominent Feshbach
resonance in 85Rb: the magnetic ﬁeld at which the magnitude of the s-wave scattering length was maximum (Bpeak)
and the magnetic ﬁeld at which the s-wave scattering length was zero (Bzero). This was done by measuring the
relative elastic scattering cross section as the magnetic ﬁeld was changed. This tightly constrained two of the three
parameters, aT and aS, for a given C6. However, C6 was much less constrained, even when combined with the results
from another experiment [9]. At the time, the temperature of the trapped atom clouds was too hot to allow the
determination of the absolute value of the scattering length [2].

We have now been able to improve the measurements made in Ref. [2] in two ways. First, the measurement of the
stability of BECs with attractive atom-atom interactions (negative a) has allowed a much more precise measurement
of Bzero. This more precise determination showed the presence of some small errors in the previous measurement.
Second, we now have a far greater range of density and temperature of the magnetically trapped atom clouds available,
and much better control over those quantities. The reproducibility and calibration were also improved. The absolute
value of the scattering length could now be accurately determined. This additional constraint allows us to completely
characterize a vs. B near the Feshbach resonance.

The more precise measurement of the position of Bzero was a natural outgrowth of our work determining the
stability of magnetically trapped BECs with attractive atom-atom interactions [5]. When large enough attractive
interactions (deﬁned by N a) are present, the BECs will become unstable and collapse. The collapse criterion is given
by the relation Ncr|a| = β, where Ncr is the number of atoms in the condensate and β = 1.41µm for our magnetic
trap. In Ref. [5], Ncr was determined as a function of magnetic ﬁeld down to very small a. A simple extrapolation to
the point where Ncr = ∞ determined the position of Bzero. The value of Bzero determined in this way is 165.85(5)
gauss (G), a factor of six more precise than before. This increase in precision occurs both because the stability
measurement is more sensitive and it avoids temperature-dependent shifts.

The new determination of Bzero disagrees with the previous measurement [2] Bzero=166.8(3)G by more than the
stated errors. A small error in the magnetic ﬁeld calibration in Ref. [2] is reponsible for 0.3G of the diﬀerence.
The remainder of the diﬀerence is likely due to temperature shifts of the elastic cross section and the temperature-
dependent asymmetry in the cross section versus magnetic ﬁeld near Bzero [10] that were not adequately included in
Ref. [2]. The new magnetic ﬁeld calibration also shifts the measured position of Bpeak to 154.9(4)G.

The absolute value of the scattering length was determined at several values of the magnetic ﬁeld, using “cross-
dimensional mixing” measurements as in Ref. [2]. In this technique, a cloud of cold atoms, created by evaporative
cooling as in Ref. [11], is perturbed from its equilibrium energy distribution. The time for the cloud to equilibrate by
elastic collisions is then measured. In the zero-temperature limit, the elastic collision cross section (σ) is σ = 8πa2.

Once the atom cloud had been cooled suﬃciently, the bias magnetic ﬁeld in the trap was ramped to near Bzero to
drastically reduce the elastic collision rate. By cutting faster with the rf-“knife” used for evaporative cooling than the
cloud could equilibrate, it was possible to remove energy in just the radial direction of the axially symmetric magnetic
trap [2]. The width of the cloud in the radial direction was decreased until the radial energy had been reduced to
0.6 of the axial direction, and then the bias magnetic ﬁeld was ramped adiabatically to a selected value and the
cloud was allowed to equilibrate for a ﬁxed time. The size, number, and shape of the cloud were measured using
on-resonance destructive absorption imaging. This procedure was repeated for diﬀerent equilibration times and the
rate of the relaxation of the aspect ratio of the clouds (the ratio of the axial width to the radial width) to equilibrium
was recorded.

relative speed q
is weakly dependent on the diﬀerence between radial and axial energy but is always within 2% of the value 2.50. It is
calculated using classical transport theory [12] with the assumption that the velocity and density distributions can be
described in each direction by a single parameter, an eﬀective temperature that is equal to the average energy divided
by the Boltzmann constant kB. A Monte-Carlo simulation agrees with this classical calculation at the 4% level [13].
The relaxation of the aspect ratio was ﬁt appropriately to determine Γ and hence a. Γ is not strictly constant as a
function of equilibration time since the density and temperature of an atom cloud varied during equilibration due to
loss, heating, and change in shape. These small (< 5%) variations were included in the ﬁts to the data. The density
and temperature of the atom cloud was measured directly along with the aspect ratio in the absorption imaging. The
density was maintained near 2.5 × 1010cm−3 and the temperature was kept near 130 nK. For these cold clouds, the
energy dependence of the average elastic cross section is expected to be less than 5%, and the ﬁts to the data included
the energy dependence due to the unitarity limit [14].

Data were taken at B=168.0, 169.7, and 251.0 G. The magnetic ﬁeld was calibrated in the same way as Ref. [2]:
the rf frequency that resonantly drove spin ﬂip transitions for atoms at the center of the cloud was measured and the
Breit-Rabi equation was used to determine the magnetic ﬁeld. Colder clouds were used, improving the precision. The
spread of the magnetic ﬁeld across the clouds was ∼ 0.2G FWHM. Figure 1 shows a set of aspect ratio equilibration
data and the corresponding ﬁt. Across the range of magnetic ﬁelds measured, the equilibration times varied by about
a factor of 30. The distance from Bpeak ensures that the spread in a due to the spread in B across the cloud was not
signiﬁcant and that the precise location of Bpeak is also not a limiting factor in analyzing the results.

The uncertainty in the determination of a is dominated by the determination of number and the ﬁt to obtain Γ.
The number determination relies on the calibration of our absorption imaging system, which was performed while
taking into account the frequency and intensity of our probe laser, optical pumping eﬀects, and the small Doppler shift
arising from scattering multiple photons. We estimate the uncertainty to be 10%, which results in a 5% uncertainty
in each determination of a. The uncertainty in the ﬁt to obtain Γ is primarily caused by small oscillations in the
aspect ratio due to the vertical and horizontal radial directions not being perfectly degenerate. Although this limited
the accuracy of the ﬁt, the size of this imbalance was varied and no signiﬁcant shifts in the results were observed.
Also, the period of the oscillations does not depend on the value of a and so the agreement between data sets of very
diﬀerent equilibration times also indicates that this eﬀect is not distorting the results signiﬁcantly. The measured
value (in atomic units) of a is -342(10), -97(6), and -60(4) at B = 251.0, 169.7, and 168.0G, respectively. The listed
uncertainty does not include the common uncertainty due to the atom number determination.

Near the Feshbach resonance, the change in a with B can be well approximated by the relation a = abg(1 −
) [15]. Using this, we can determine abg for each measured value of a (Fig. 2). The weighted average of

Bzero−Bpeak
B−Bpeak

all of these data gives abg = −380(21) where the uncertainty is dominated by the determination of number.

Our measurement now constrains all three parameters needed to describe the Rb-Rb potential for ultracold colli-
sions. Using the same methods presented in Ref. [2], the Rb-Rb Born-Oppenheimer potentials are adjusted until the
theoretically predicted Bzero, Bpeak, and abg match the observed values. The calculation of a vs. B is performed using
a quantum defect method [16]. Matching the Rb-Rb potential to the observed scattering lengths implies aT (85Rb)
= −332 ± 18, aS(85Rb)=3650+1500
−670 [17], and C6 = 4660 ± 20, where all of the values are listed in atomic units [18].
This value of the C6 coeﬃcient is consistent both with an ab initio calculation [19] and a recent photoassociation

As a result of improvements in our experimental techniques and the measurement of 85Rb BEC stability in the
presence of attractive interactions, we have been able to improve our characterization of the prominent Feshbach
resonance in 85Rb.

[17] The singlet scattering potential has a bound state very near to the collision threshold and so aS is close to diverging. This

accounts for the large error bars on aS.

[18] The quoted values for aT , aS and C6 are calculated using the values of C8 and C10 predicted in M. Marinescu and L. You,

by about 25%.

FIG. 1. Relaxation of the aspect ratio to equilibrium. The data shown here were taken at B=169.7G. Each data point (•)
represents a single destructive absorption measurement. The solid line shows the ﬁt to the data used to determine the elastic
scattering cross section and hence the scattering length. The deviation of the data points from the ﬁt around 3-4 seconds is
due to the oscillations between the two radial directions as described in the main text.

FIG. 2. The value of abg implied by several cross-dimensional mixing measurements. This value was determined by dividing
the s-wave scattering length determined at a particular magnetic ﬁeld by the factor (1 − Bzero−Bpeak
). The s-wave scattering
lengths measured at 251.0G were divided by an additional factor of 0.99 to account for the deviation of the approximate
description of a vs. B from the full theory calculation. The error bars shown include the statistical errors plus the ﬁt
uncertainty due the initial radial energy imbalance. The ﬁt uncertainty is non-statistical and so the central values are clustered
together more than the error bars would suggest.

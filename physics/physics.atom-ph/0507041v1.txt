We have observed spontaneous symmetry breaking of atomic populations in the dynamic phase-
space double-potential system, which is produced in the parametrically driven magneto-optical trap
of atoms. We ﬁnd that the system exhibits similar characteristics of the Ising-class phase transition
and the critical value of the control parameter, which is the total atomic number, can be calculated.
In particular, the collective eﬀect of the laser shadow becomes dominant at large atomic number,
which is responsible for the population asymmetry of the dynamic two-state system. This study
may be useful for investigation of dynamic phase transition and temporal behaviour of critical
phenomena.

The phenomena of symmetry breaking, widespread in
nature with examples from cosmology to biology, have
been much studied [1, 2, 3]. Recently in a vibro-
ﬂuidized granular gas, spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB) of temperature and population between two com-
partments connected by a hole was reported and under-
stood in terms of the density-dependent inelastic collision
rates [4, 5]. Moreover there have been many works on
ﬂuctuation-induced transitions in equilibrium [6, 7, 8] as
well as far from equilibrium [9, 10, 11]. The double well
structure of these systems is very similar to the two com-
partments of the granular box, where SSB was observed.
In particular, we have recently studied the atomic pop-
ulation transition between two dynamic phase-space at-
tractors available in the parametrically driven magneto-
optical trap (MOT) system [11].

In this Letter, we report on experimental as well as
theoretical investigation of SSB of the atomic popula-
tion between two dynamic states of the driven MOT.
We have found that the control parameter for SSB is
the total number of atoms in both states: The popula-
tion equality between the two equivalent states is broken
spontaneously above a critical number of atoms. This
phenomenon can be well understood as the Ising-class
phase transition. We have measured the critical num-
ber under various experimental parameters and also ob-
served the temporal evolution from symmetric to asym-
metric states above threshold. The SSB mechanism is
described qualitatively by considering two collective in-
teractions occurring at large atomic number, the shadow
eﬀect and the reradiation eﬀect [12, 13, 14, 15]. In par-
ticular, the measured critical numbers are in good agree-
ment with the analytical and the simulational results.

The experimental scheme is similar to those reported
in previous works on parametrically modulated MOT

[11, 16], where we observed parametric excitation, limit
cycles (dynamic phase-space attractors), super-critical
and sub-critical bifurcation. In particular, the bifurca-
tions were explained by atomic double- and triple-well
potentials in the rotating phase space. Due to ﬂuctu-
ating atomic motions resulting from spontaneous emis-
sions, population transfer occurs between the two states
of dynamic double well, which tends to equalize the pop-
ulation of each state [Fig. 1(a)]. This atomic transition
between the two states oscillating in position space (Fig.
1) was conﬁrmed by observing the temporal recovery of
the population symmetry after emptying one state. In
this case, the recovering rates are equivalent to the tran-
sition rates [11].

It is interesting to observe that the population symme-
try, which is equivalent to zero spontaneous magnetiza-
tion in the Ising spin system, is only maintained below a
certain critical value of the total atomic number. Above
the critical number, however, we have observed SSB of
atomic population, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The SSB can
be observed under wide experimental conditions of modu-
lation frequency f and amplitude h, from super-critical to
sub-critical bifurcation regions. The atomic populations
were simultaneously measured by resonant absorption of
a weak probe laser. The typical experimental parameters
are as follows: magnetic-ﬁeld gradient along the atomic
oscillation direction (z-direction) b = 14 G/cm, cooling
laser detuning δ = -2.6 Γ, and laser intensity in the z-axis
Iz = 0.039 Is (Is is the averaged saturation intensity, 3.78
mW/cm2). The intensity on the transverse axes is typi-
cally 5 times larger than that of the z-axis. The measured

larger than that expected in the Doppler theory [17].

number Nc. We have measured N1 and N2 by two inde-
pendent methods: CCD images (ﬁlled black boxes) and
probe absorption (empty boxes). NT was varied by ad-
justing the intensity of the repumping laser while all the
other trap parameters remain ﬁxed. Note that we did
not ﬁnd any other control parameters other than NT :
for instance, the intensity imbalance between the +z and
z laser beams did not contribute to SSB for the imbal-
−
ance of up to 20%, beyond which the atomic limit cycle
motions were not sustained.

We have measured the critical number Nc at various
experimental parameters of f and h. For example, at
107
h = 0.86, Nc decreases gently from 7.9
as f increases from 1.95f0 to 2.4f0 (f0 is the MOT trap
frequency along the z-axis). At f = 2.1f0 (= 90 Hz),

creases from 0.64 to 0.86.
In brief, Nc increases with
the transition rate W : when f or h increases, W de-
creases (see Ref.
[11] for details), and consequently Nc
becomes decreased. However, SSB is not observed out-
side the above region of parameters, that is, near the
super-critical or sub-critical bifurcation points. Around
the super-critical bifurcation point, W becomes too large
to load atoms enough to produce SSB in our experimen-
tal system. Near the sub-critical bifurcation point, on
the other hand, despite the low Nc, only the population
of the central stationary state among the triple wells in-
creases, whereas those of the two dynamic states do not
increase above Nc [11].

In order to have a better understanding of SSB, we
have investigated the temporal evolution of the popula-
tions of each state when SSB occurs. Figure 2(b) shows
the atomic populations recorded by the absorption of
the probe laser. As can be found, in the initial load-
ing stage, the number of atoms in each state increases
at the same rate and their growth is indistinguishable
with each other. As the loading process is ﬁnished at
about 20 s elapse, however, the population of one state
increases whereas the other state is depopulated. The
fact that the total atomic number is conserved within ex-
perimental errors during the SSB process indicates that
SSB originates not from diﬀerent loading rates to each
state but from the transfer of atoms from one state to

the other. Moreover, when we place a kicking laser near
the center of the two dynamic states in order to block any
transitions between the states, the population symmetry
is recovered. These evidences conﬁrm that SSB occurs
due to the atomic transfer between the two states.

Based on the fact that SSB appears above the critical
number, one may conjecture that the underlying mecha-
nism of SSB is related to the collective eﬀects of atoms
occurring between the two dynamic states [12, 13, 14, 15].
There are two such collective mechanisms associated with
the MOT atoms. One is the shadow eﬀect caused by ab-
sorption of the cooling lasers in the z-axis due to atoms
in one of the two states, which results in the reduction
of the laser intensity for atoms in the other state. The
other is the reradiation eﬀect that arises when an atom
reabsorbs photons that are spontaneously emitted by an-
other atom, which produces the repulsive Coulomb-like
forces between the two atoms.

The reradiation eﬀect, in fact, contributes as an ob-
stacle to SSB. As the number of atoms in one of the
two states becomes dominated due to ﬂuctuations, the
repulsive reradiation force becomes bigger outside the
more-populated atomic cloud. As a result, this eﬀect
prevents atoms in the smaller-number state from being
transferred to the larger-number state, which results in
the recovery of population symmetry between the two
states. On the other hand, the shadow eﬀect acceler-
ates atoms to move from the smaller-number state to the
larger-number state: due to the bigger shadow eﬀects
associated with the larger-number state, the net atomic
force is directed toward the larger-number state, which
enhances SSB further.

For a theoretical understanding of SSB process, we
have adopted the phase-space Hamiltonian-function for-
malism developed in Ref.
[18] to account for the tran-
sitions between the dynamic double wells [11]. We then
have generalized the approach to include the shadow ef-

fect as well as the reradiation force. This approach pro-
vides quantitative analysis of nearly all the fundamental
characteristics of SSB such as the critical number and
the temporal evolution.

where µ = 2(f
2f0)/hf0, Xi and Yi are the two scaled
canonical variables in the rotating phase space, as repre-
sented in Fig. 3(a). The total Hamiltonian H0 without
the interaction terms is just the summation of each H 0
i ,
H0 = P
i . Note that, in our analysis, the two os-
cillating atomic states can be approximated as a static
double well in the phase space [Fig. 3(a)]. For example,
the right- and left-side cloud with respect to the center
of the limit cycle motion along the z-axis corresponds
to the positive and negative state, respectively, in the Y
axis at a given modulation phase of 0◦. Note also that
the maximum points in the phase-space potential in Fig.
3 indicate attractors.

Let us ﬁrst consider the shadow eﬀect that is respon-
sible for SSB. At the speciﬁc modulation phase of 0◦,
we assume the right-side atomic cloud is the state 1 and
the left-side cloud is the state 2. Because of the Zeeman
shift, atoms in state 2 and state 1 absorb preferentially
z direc-
the cooling lasers propagating in the +z and
tion, respectively. Now we consider another j-th atom in
state 1 or 2, which absorbs the laser by the amount I j
A =
LnρIz, where σj
σj
L is the absorption cross-section of the

−

j-th atom and nρ is the density of atoms in the xy-plane.
One can then easily ﬁnd that each laser photon absorbed
by the j-th atom eﬀectively results in a cooperative force
(or acceleration) on the i-th atom concerned, whose mag-
nitude is given by CSσj
LnρIz/Is. That is, when the atom
j is in state 1 (i.e., in the right-side cloud absorbing the
photons propagating in the -z axis), the direction of the
eﬀective force experienced by the i-th atom is positive
along the z-axis, whereas it is negative when the j-th
atom is in state 2. If one considers, for convenience, the
i-th atom is near the center, the net eﬀective force exerted
on the i-th atom is given by Pj CSI j
N2)
CSIA/Is. Therefore the i-th atom is transferred to the
larger-number state on the right (state 1) [Fig. 3(b)].
Note that if one considers the π phase of modulation,
although the location of state 1 (2) is now exchanged
to the left (right), the net force is still directed to the
larger-number state of 1.

third-order term in the Doppler equation of MOT [16].
H ′ is a given coeﬃcient that is practically independent
of j, with no contribution to SSB. Here σL is regarded as
having no dependence on velocity and position of atoms,
which are assumed uniformly distributed in the xy-plane.
We will discuss later about more realistic treatment of the
shadow eﬀect with Monte-Carlo simulations. As shown
in Fig. 3(b), the shadow eﬀect makes the potential of
the larger-number state (state 1) deeper, whereas that of
the smaller-number state (state 2) shallower. As a result,
more atoms will be transferred from state 2 to state 1, re-
sulting in SSB of the atomic population. In fact, however,
there are competitions between the shadow-induced SSB
and the ﬂuctuation-induced symmetry-recovering transi-
tion. Therefore the critical number is determined by the
balance between the shadow eﬀect and the diﬀusion.

Let us now consider the symmetry-preserving reradia-
tion eﬀect. Figure 3(c) presents the results of reradiation
interaction H R
i , which reduces the SSB eﬀect (detailed
expression of H R
i will be given elsewhere). Brieﬂy speak-
ing, the reradiation eﬀect increases the critical number by
CR, where CR = IT σ2
reducing α to α
L/4πc[3π + 8(4 +
3 ln 2)]/6π2Rzβζ2η2f . The calculation also shows that,
if the transverse laser intensity is over 10 times larger
than that of the z-direction laser, the reradiation eﬀect
dominates over the shadow eﬀect, which inhibits SSB for
every NT . In practice, we have experimentally observed
that the recovery of symmetry appears at about 20 times
the z-laser intensity, which is a strong and independent

To manifest further the relation with the Ising model,
let us consider a simpliﬁed model where each atom i

√µ + 1). The activation energy Si due to the

We also have performed Monte-Carlo simulations with
more realistic consideration of the shadow eﬀect and the
reradiation force: we included the dependence of σL on
the position and velocity, the transverse laser-intensity
proﬁle, and the random forces due to spontaneous emis-
sions. Figure 4(a) shows ∆p versus NT , which is very
similar to the experimental results in Fig. 2(a). Figure
4(b) presents the simulation curves for the temporal evo-
lution of SSB. Here we have just included the shadow
eﬀect and used a diﬀusion constant that is 2.5 times the
value derived from the simple Doppler theory. When the
reradiation force is included in the simulations, however,
Nc is slightly increased and SSB does not occur if the
transverse laser intensity is over 10 times the z-laser in-
tensity. In conclusion, nonlinear dynamic study of driven
cold atoms may be useful for dynamic phase transition
and temporal dependence of critical phenomena.

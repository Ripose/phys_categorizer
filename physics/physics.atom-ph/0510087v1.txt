171Yb atoms

Abstract. We propose an experiment to search for a permanent atomic electric-dipole moment (EDM)
using laser-cooled 171Yb atoms launched in an atomic fountain. A uniform B ﬁeld sets the quantization axis,
and the Ramsey separated-oscillatory-ﬁelds method is used to measure the Zeeman precession frequency
of the atoms. Laser beams of appropriate polarization are used for preparation and detection in a given
magnetic sublevel. The signature of an EDM is a shift in the Ramsey resonance correlated with application
of a large E ﬁeld. The precision is expected to be at least 20 times better than current limits because the use
of a cold atomic beam allows application of E ﬁeld 10 times larger than in a vapor cell, and the interaction
time with the E ﬁeld is 200 times larger compared to a thermal beam. The leading source of systematic
error in beam experiments, the E × v/c motional magnetic ﬁeld, is reduced considerably because of the
near-perfect reversal of velocity between up and down trajectories through the E-ﬁeld region.

1 Introduction

The existence of a permanent electric-dipole moment (EDM)
in a particle implies that both parity (P) and time-reversal
symmetry (T) are violated. Experimental searches for an
EDM are motivated by the discovery of CP violation (and
the consequent T violation) in neutral kaon decay [1].
The Standard Model (SM) accommodates CP violation
by predicting EDMs that are 8 to 9 orders of magnitude
less than current experimental limits. However, theories
going beyond the SM, such as supersymmetry, predict
EDMs within experimental range [2], and are strongly
constrained by measured limits on EDMs. Thus EDM
searches form an important tool in looking for new physics
beyond the SM.

Some of the most sensitive EDM searches have so far
been done on the neutron [3,4], or on diﬀerent atoms and
molecules. In atoms, an EDM can arise due to either (i) an
intrinsic EDM of the electron, (ii) an intrinsic EDM of the
neutron or proton, or (iii) a PT-violating nucleon-nucleon
or electron-nucleon interaction [5]. Diﬀerent atoms have
diﬀerent sensitivities to these sources of EDM. In heavy
paramagnetic atoms such as Cs and Tl, the atomic EDM
is enhanced by a factor of 100–1000 times over the in-
trinsic electron EDM due to relativistic eﬀects [6]. There-
fore experiments on such atoms put stringent limits on
the existence of an electron EDM [7,8]. The best limit
10−27 e-cm comes from an experiment using a
of 1.6

thermal beam of 205Tl atoms [9]. On the other hand, dia-
magnetic atoms (such as Hg and Yb) are more sensitive
to the nuclear Schiﬀ moment and possible PT-odd inter-
actions. Experiments have been done on 129Xe [10] and
10−28
199Hg [11] in vapor cells, with the best limit of 2.1
e-cm from the 199Hg experiment. Sensitive EDM searches
have also been done using diatomic molecules containing
heavy atoms, notably TlF [12] and YbF [13]. Recently,
PbO has been proposed as a good candidate for probing
the electron EDM [14].

×

In this paper, we propose an experiment to search for
an atomic EDM using laser-cooled 171Yb launched in an
atomic fountain. The experiment is performed in the pres-
ence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld that sets the quantization
axis. As the atoms fall under gravity, they are ﬁrst spin
polarized, and then interact with an oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld twice, once on the way up and once on the way down.
The interactions are used to perform a Ramsey separated-
oscillatory-ﬁelds measurement [15] of the Zeeman preces-
sion frequency. In between the two interactions, the atoms
pass through a region of large electric ﬁeld, applied in a di-
rection parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. The signature of an
EDM is a shift in the Ramsey resonance correlated with
the reversal of the electric ﬁeld.

There are three primary advantages to our scheme.
The ﬁrst is that laser cooling provides a slow, dense sam-
ple of atoms that is almost purely mono-energetic. Thus
the interaction time with the electric ﬁeld is very long
(compared to a thermal beam) and almost exactly the
same for all atoms. The second advantage is that we use

2

the power of the Ramsey technique to measure the Zee-
man precession frequency. This ensures high precision in
the frequency measurement. The third advantage is that
the leading source of systematic error, namely the eﬀect of
the motional magnetic ﬁeld (Bmot = E
v/c), is greatly
reduced. This is because the velocity of the atoms reverses
between the up and down trajectories, and the net eﬀect
is zero.

×

We have chosen Yb because it has been successfully
laser cooled in our laboratory [16] and elsewhere [17,18].
It is a heavy diamagnetic atom and eﬀects leading to EDM
are comparable to that in Hg. Furthermore, atomic calcu-
lations in Yb, which are necessary for relating the mea-
sured EDM to fundamental PT-violating interactions, are
well developed [19]. Precise atomic calculations in Yb [20]
have also been motivated by the fact that Yb is a promis-
ing candidate for measuring atomic parity-nonconservation
eﬀects [21,22]. There are two isotopes of Yb that are suit-
able for an EDM measurement: 171Yb (I = 1/2) and
173Yb (I = 5/2). Both isotopes have roughly the same
natural abundance (14.3% and 16.1%, respectively), but
we have chosen 171Yb because its simple magnetic-sublevel
structure allows for an extremely state-selective detection
scheme, as discussed later. However, it might be interest-
ing to measure EDM in both isotopes to address nuclear-
interaction related uncertainties when comparing experi-
mental results with atomic calculations.

The use of laser-cooled atoms to measure EDM has
been proposed earlier. In the early days of laser cooling,
possible measurement of the electron EDM using cold Cs
atoms in an atomic fountain was considered [23]. How-
ever, it was shown that Cs has potential problems with
cold collisions that cause spin relaxation and lead to fre-
quency shifts [24]. Closed-shell fermionic atoms with a 1S0
ground state, such as 171Yb, do not have these problems.
Indeed, once these atoms are spin polarized, the s-wave
scattering cross section is zero, while higher scattering
cross sections go to zero at suﬃciently low temperatures.
Thus the spin-coherence time is of order 1000 s or more be-
cause eﬀects such as three-body recombination rates and
collisional spin relaxation are greatly reduced. There is
a recent proposal to measure EDM using laser-cooled Cs
atoms trapped in optical lattices [25]. In this case, there
are potential systematic eﬀects due to AC Stark shifts in
the Zeeman sublevels caused by the trapping ﬁelds. Simi-
lar Zeeman frequency shifts are present for proposed EDM
experiments using cold atoms in far-detuned dipole traps.
The size of these shifts have been calculated both for para-
magnetic atoms (Cs) and diamagnetic atoms (Hg) [26],
showing that the experimental conﬁguration needs to be
carefully designed to control these eﬀects. The major ad-
vantage of a fountain experiment is that there is no pertur-
bation from trapping ﬁelds during the EDM measurement.
However, it should be noted that the interaction time in a
fountain experiment is limited to less than a second due to
gravity, whereas the background-collision limited interac-
tion time in an optical lattice can be 10–100 times longer.

2 Experimental details

Atomic EDMs are measured using spin-polarized atoms in
the presence of parallel (or anti-parallel) electric (E) and
magnetic (B) ﬁelds. Since the total angular momentum
(F) is the only vector quantity in the body-ﬁxed frame,
both the electric-dipole moment (d) and the magnetic-
dipole moment (µ) are proportional to F. Therefore, the
interaction Hamiltonian in the presence of the E and B
ﬁelds is given by:

Hint =

(dE + µB)

−

F

.

·

The Zeeman precession frequency changes when the direc-
tion of the E ﬁeld is reversed from parallel to anti-parallel.
For 171Yb, the nuclear spin I is 1/2, and an atom in the
1S0 ground state has F = 1/2. Thus the change in the
Zeeman precession frequency on E-ﬁeld reversal is

(1)

(2)

∆ω0 =

2dE

.

Measurement of ∆ω0 therefore constitutes a measurement
of the EDM d.

The above analysis shows that, in order to measure d
precisely, one needs to (i) measure the Zeeman precession
frequency very precisely, (ii) have a large E ﬁeld, and (iii)
keep the interaction time with the E ﬁeld as large as pos-
sible. Atomic EDM measurements are usually performed
using thermal beams [9,27] or in vapor cells [8,11]. With
thermal beams, the main limitation is that the interaction
time is only a few milliseconds even if the E-ﬁeld region is
100 cm long. We will see later that the use of cold atoms
increases the interaction time by a factor of 200. In vapor-
cell experiments, the applied E ﬁeld is limited by the high
pressure to about 10 kV/cm. The use of an atomic beam
allows the E ﬁeld to be at least 10 times higher.

The schematic of the proposed experiment is shown
in Fig. 1. The atoms are ﬁrst laser cooled and trapped
in a magneto-optic trap (MOT). For Yb, there are two
transitions that can be used for laser cooling: the 1S0
↔
1P 1 transition at 399 nm, and the 1S0
3P 1 inter-
combination line at 556 nm. Both lines are accessible with
existing laser technology, the ﬁrst using a frequency-doubled
Ti-sapphire laser, and the second using a dye laser oper-
ating with Rhodamine 110 dye. We have earlier shown
that a Yb MOT can be directly loaded from a thermal
source (without the use of a Zeeman slower) using the
399 nm line [16]. The source is not isotopically enriched
and contains all the seven stable isotopes in their natural
abundances. We are able to trap each isotope individu-
ally since the isotope shifts are about 100–1000 MHz and
the individual transitions are clearly resolved. The typical
number of trapped atoms is more than 108. In Ref. [17],
Yb atoms emanating from an oven are ﬁrst slowed in a
Zeeman slower using the 399 nm line, and then captured
in a MOT operating with the 556 nm line. The primary
advantage of the 556 nm line is that its natural linewidth
is only 180 kHz, which results in a Doppler cooling limit
of 4 µK. Therefore, for the EDM experiment it is desir-
able to use a MOT with the 556 nm line. The MOT can

3

be loaded directly from a Zeeman slower or from another
MOT operating with the 399 nm line.

Once the atoms are loaded into the trap, the trap-
magnetic ﬁeld is turned oﬀ and the atoms are allowed to
equilibriate in the optical molasses. They are then launched
upwards using the standard technique of moving molasses:
the detuning of the vertical beams is adjusted so that the
atoms are cooled in a frame moving upwards at a velocity
of 2.5 m/s. Since the energy spread in the vertical direc-
tion still corresponds to the cooling limit of 4 µK, the
vertical velocity varies by less than 1%. This means that
the spread in the interaction time is only of order 1%. By
comparison, the velocity spread in the Tl experiment is
50%, corresponding to the full thermal distribution at

±
970 K [9].

The EDM experiment is done in the presence of a static
magnetic ﬁeld of 1.33 G that also sets the quantization
axis. The resulting Zeeman precession frequency in the
F = 1/2 ground state is
1 kHz. For comparison the Tl
experiment uses a magnetic ﬁeld of 0.4 G, whereas the Hg
experiment uses a ﬁeld of 0.015 G.

The freely falling atoms are ﬁrst spin polarized using
a beam of right-circularly polarized (σ+) light at 556 nm.
F ′ = 1/2 tran-
The laser is tuned to the F = 1/2
sition. Since this is a closed transition, atoms are opti-
cally pumped into the mF = +1/2 sublevel of the ground
state. The atoms then pass through an interaction re-
gion consisting of a magnetic ﬁeld rotating at the Zee-
man precession frequency. The strength of the rotating
ﬁeld is adjusted such that the interaction appears as a
π/2 pulse, which puts the atoms in an equal superposi-
tion of mF = +1/2 and mF =
1/2 sublevels. Since the
velocity spread is
1%, all the atoms experience a π/2
pulse. On the way down, the atoms interact again with
the rotating ﬁeld for a second π/2 pulse. If the oscilla-
tor is exactly on resonance with the Zeeman precession
frequency, the second π/2 pulse completes the transfer of
population to the mF =
1/2 sublevel. This is a standard
Ramsey separated-oscillatory-ﬁelds method for measuring
the precession frequency [15].
Population in the mF =

ing a probe laser on the 556 nm line. The probe laser is
similar to the optical pumping laser: it is right-circularly
polarized (σ+) and drives the

transition. As shown in Fig.
{
2, this is an extremely state-selective detection scheme.
Any atoms in the mF = +1/2 sublevel of the ground
state do not interact with the probe laser because the
only transition from this sublevel driven by the σ+ light
sublevel, which is al-
is to the
most 6 GHz away [28]. Thus the laser is detuned by more
than 30 000 linewidths, and the transition probability is
reduced by a factor of 109. Note that the intensity of the
probe can be much greater than the saturation intensity
(0.14 mW/cm2) since it is not important that atoms ab-
sorb only once from the laser. After the ﬁrst excitation,
atoms can decay back into either sublevel and the second
excitation takes place only for those atoms that decay into
1/2 sublevel. Indeed, to maximize the signal-

to-noise ratio, one would like to have the atoms continue
to interact with the probe laser until all of them are opti-
cally pumped into the mF = +1/2 sublevel. A simple way
to achieve this is to use the state-preparation beam also as
the detection beam. The signal could be either from the
absorbed photons or the emitted ﬂuorescence.

In between the two π/2 pulses, the atoms go through a
region of large E ﬁeld (where the B ﬁeld is also present).
Since the atoms are launched upwards with a velocity of
2.5 m/s, the height before they turn around due to gravity
is 32 cm. Therefore the E-ﬁeld interaction can be about
30 cm long, corresponding to a total interaction time of
500 ms. By comparison, the interaction time in the Tl
experiment is only 2.4 ms, even though the E-ﬁeld plates
are 100 cm long [9].

3 Expected statistical precision

To estimate the expected precision in the measurement,
we ﬁrst note that the atoms are like oscillators whose
phase is being measured by the Ramsey technique. If the
atom starts with an initial phase φ0, then after the Ram-
sey interrogation time T , the phase is given by

φ = φ0 + ω0T + φn ,

(3)

where φn is the additional (random) phase noise due to
spin decoherence. The presence of this noise limits the sta-
tistical uncertainty in each measurement. If the decoher-
ence is a Poissonian process characterized by a time con-
stant τ , the variance in φ increases linearly with the mea-
surement time as T /τ . Therefore, the frequency measure-
ment on each atom has an uncertainty given by 1/√τ T .
If we make a simultaneous measurement on an ensemble
of N atoms, then the shot-noise-limited uncertainty in the
average frequency is

δωSN =

1
√N τ T

.

(4)

(5)

Even though the above equation suggests that the mea-
surement time T should be increased indeﬁnitely to min-
imize the noise, it is clear from Eq. (3) that T should not
be much larger than τ , since otherwise the phase would be
completely randomized by the noise. Rather, the statisti-
cal error should be reduced by repeating the measurement
several times. The ﬁnal error in the EDM d after repeating
the measurement R times is:

δd =

¯h
2E√RN τ T

.

To estimate the coherence time τ in the fountain, we
note that Yb is a closed-shell atom and the coherence time
is expected to be very long. For example, in the analo-
gous case of Hg, coherence times on the order of 500 s
are achieved in a room-temperature vapor cell by using
buﬀer gases (N2 and CO) and having paraﬃn-coated cell
walls to minimize spin relaxation [11]. On the other hand,

4

Vasant Natarajan: Proposed search for an electric-dipole moment using laser-cooled 171Yb atoms

in the case of paramagnetic atoms such as Cs, the coher-
ence time in a vapor cell is only about 15 ms even in the
presence of N2 buﬀer gas [8]. For laser-cooled Na atoms,
the coherence time measured in a far-oﬀ resonance, red-
detuned dipole trap is again only 15 ms [29]. However,
in the same experiment, the coherence time increased by
300 times to 4.4 s when a blue-detuned trap of compara-
ble depth was used. In the blue-detuned trap, atoms are
repelled by the optical potential and spend most of their
time in free fall. This demonstrates the advantage of hav-
ing the atoms away from any trapping potential. Going
by the experiments with Na, a conservative estimate for
the coherence time of Yb atoms in a fountain is 1000 s,
where we have assumed only a factor of two increase from
the value for similar atoms in a vapor cell.

×

To calculate the ﬁnal precision, we assume that the
applied E ﬁeld is 100 kV/cm, which is the typical ﬁeld
used in atomic-beam experiments. The number of atoms
N in the fountain can be as high as 109. Using τ = 1000
s and T = 0.5 s, the shot-noise limited uncertainty in the
frequency measurement is 225 nHz (or a relative precision
10−10 in the measurement of the Zeeman pre-
of 2.25
cession frequency). The repetition rate of the experiment
can be about 0.5 Hz. Therefore, we can reach the preci-
10−28 e-cm) in about 18
sion of the Hg experiment (2
minutes. By contrast, the Hg experiment takes about 300
days to achieve this precision. In 5 days, we would achieve
10−29 e-cm (frequency precision of 0.484
a precision of 1
nHz), which is 20 times better than the best previous mea-
surement. This analysis also shows the advantage of using
a cold atomic beam. If we used instead a thermal beam
moving at 400 m/s, the interaction time would be 0.75
ms. Even if we assume that the coherence time is 1000 s,
the frequency uncertainty in each measurement would be
5.8 µHz. This is why the Tl experiment has a frequency
uncertainty as large as 25 µHz even after 6 days of aver-
aging.

4 Systematic errors – the E

v eﬀect

×

The above estimate of the statistical error is meaningful
only if we can keep systematic errors below this level. The
leading source of systematic error in any beam experiment
is due to the motional magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. the applied elec-
tric ﬁeld appears as a magnetic ﬁeld in the rest frame of
the atom. If the atom is moving with a velocity v, the
total magnetic ﬁeld in the atom’s frame is given by:

The ﬁrst term in the above equation gives the correct Zee-
man precession frequency. The third term is unimportant
because it is very small and, moreover, is even under re-
versal of the E ﬁeld. However, the second term leads to
a systematic error since it is odd under E-ﬁeld reversal
and mimics the EDM signal. The shift in the precession
frequency due to this term is given by:

ωE×v = γ

,

(9)

103

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, equal to 4.7288
rad s−1G−1 for 171Yb.

×

It is clear from Eq. (9) that the systematic error can-
cels if the sign of v reverses during the measurement. In
the Tl experiment, this is achieved by using two atomic
beams, one going up and the other going down, and care-
fully adjusting the oven temperatures for cancellation of
the shift. The use of an atomic fountain has the velocity
reversal built into it. During the free fall, the z-component
of velocity at any point along the trajectory changes sign
between the upward and downward trajectories. Since the
E and B ﬁelds are nominally along the x direction, the
net eﬀect is zero.

However, to account fully for the shift, we must con-
sider that the E and B ﬁelds may not be perfectly in the
x direction, and that there are small velocity components
along the x and y directions that do not reverse under
gravity. For this analysis, we choose our coordinate system
with the z axis deﬁned by gravity and the x axis deﬁned
by the nominal E (and B) ﬁeld direction. In such a sys-
tem, the residual components of the E and B ﬁelds arise
mainly due to alignment errors while the residual velocity
components arise due to two reasons: (i) ﬁnite transverse
temperature in the optical molasses and (ii) misalignment
between the vertical molasses beam and the gravity axis.
To estimate the size of these eﬀects, let us expand Eq. (9):

The ﬁrst term in the above equation is by far the domi-
nant term and cancels under the perfect reversal of vz. The
third term is a product of two residual ﬁelds with a small
velocity component, and is completely negligible. The sec-
ond term is the only one we have to consider because it
includes the large x components of the ﬁelds:

The transverse temperature in the molasses is 4 µK,
which results in an rms velocity of vy = 1.4 cm/s. How-
ever, the mean velocity is zero, and there are equal num-
bers of atoms with positive and negative velocity compo-
nents. Therefore, averaged over all atoms, the net eﬀect
due to the transverse temperature is zero. On the other
hand, if there is a misalignment between the vertical mo-
lasses direction and the direction of gravity, atoms would
be launched in a direction inclined to gravity and there

would be a net transverse velocity component. The verti-
cal molasses direction can be geometrically aligned with
gravity to better than a part in 1000. In addition, the
direction can be optimized by maximizing the number
of atoms that return to the starting point in the atomic
fountain. Assuming such alignment, we ﬁnd the value of
vy is 2.5 mm/s. From Eq. (11), to get a systematic shift
smaller than 0.05 nHz, corresponding to an EDM of 10−30
e-cm, the values of Bz/Bx and Ez/Ex should be below
10−5. This is quite reasonable since cancellation of
2.4
10−7 has been reported in the
transverse ﬁelds below 5
Tl work [27]. Furthermore, we have an experimental han-
dle to measure the size of this eﬀect since vy can be var-
ied systematically by varying the direction of launch. By
3◦, one should be able to mea-
studying its variation over
sure the size of the term and, if necessary, determine the
point of minimum error.

×

×

One other eﬀect of the transverse velocity is that the
atom samples a slightly diﬀerent location of the ﬁeld be-
tween the up and down trajectories. Using the transverse
velocity of 2.5 mm/s, the diﬀerence in location is less than
1 mm. Over this length scale, we can expect the ﬁeld to be
uniform and safely neglect any ﬁeld gradients. Again the
eﬀect of the transverse velocity due to the ﬁnite transverse
temperature would be larger but cancels when we average
over all atoms.

×

We have analyzed the E

v eﬀect in detail because
this is the dominant source of systematic error in atomic-
beam experiments. However, there are other sources of
error such as imperfect reversal of the E ﬁeld, imper-
fect laser-beam polarization, stray magnetic ﬁelds from
charging and leakage currents on the E-ﬁeld plates, stray
magnetic ﬁeld from the high-voltage switch, etc. Many of
these eﬀects can be studied by the following “experimental
handles”: reversals of the B ﬁeld, the phase of the oscil-
lating ﬁeld, and the polarization of the state-preparation
and detection laser. In general, the more the number of
reversals, the better the discrimination against system-
atic eﬀects. Furthermore, by varying the vertical launch
velocity and direction, one can probe velocity-dependent
systematic eﬀects and explore diﬀerent spatial regions of
the apparatus.

5 EDM Measurement in the 3P 0 state

→

There is another interesting possibility in the Yb sys-
tem, which is that the EDM can be measured in the 3P 0
metastable state. The lifetime of this state is very long
since the 0
0 transition to the ground state is strongly
forbidden. The lifetime is expected to be much longer than
the 15 s lifetime of the nearby 3P 2 state. The major ad-
vantage of the 3P 0 state is that its mixing with states of
opposite parity is 2.5 times larger than the ground state.
The nearest state of opposite parity is the 3D1 state, which
is only 7200 cm−1 away. This implies that PT-violating in-
teractions leading to an EDM will be enhanced compared
to the ground state.

Experimentally, measuring EDM in the 3P 0 state of
one of the odd isotopes (171Yb or 173Yb) is slightly more

→

complicated. The state would be populated using a two-
photon process (see Fig. 3) driving successively the 1S0
→
3P 1 transition (556 nm) and the 3P 1
3D1 transition
(1.54 µm), which results in spontaneous decay into the
3P 0 state with a 70% branching ratio. Detection in a mag-
netic sublevel would be achieved by measuring the absorp-
tion of a probe laser driving the 3P 0
3D1 transition at
1.38 µm. Diode lasers at 1.54 µm and 1.38 µm are avail-
able commercially and accessing these transitions is not a
problem. Theoretical calculations of the enhanced EDM in
the metastable state will tell us whether the measurement
is worth pursuing.

6 Conclusions

In summary, we have proposed a new experiment to search
for a permanent electric-dipole moment using laser-cooled
171Yb atoms launched in an atomic fountain. Cold dia-
magnetic atoms in a fountain are nearly perfect from an
experimental point of view: they are in free fall under grav-
ity and free from any trapping potential, they are in an
ultra-high-vacuum environment with very few collisions,
they hardly interact with each other, and they move slowly
enough that the interaction time with external ﬁelds can
be very long. We plan to use the Ramsey technique to
measure the Zeeman precession frequency in the presence
of a uniform B ﬁeld, which guarantees high precision in
the frequency measurement. The proposal has several ad-
vantages compared to other measurement schemes: long
interaction times and reduction in transit-time broaden-
ing compared to experiments using thermal beams, and
use of large electric ﬁelds compared to vapor-cell experi-
ments. The leading source of systematic error with atomic
v/c motional magnetic ﬁeld, is greatly re-
beams, the E
duced due to the near-perfect reversal of velocity between
up and down trajectories. Other systematic eﬀects that
scale as the velocity should also be reduced since the ve-
locity is 200 times smaller compared to a thermal beam.
10−29 e-cm is achiev-
We estimate that a precision of 1
able with 5 days integration time, which is more than an
order of magnitude better than the current limit in 199Hg.

Fig. 1. Schematic of the proposed experiment. Laser-cooled
171Yb atoms are launched upwards in an atomic fountain. The
z axis is the direction of gravity. The oscillating ﬁelds are used
to measure the Zeeman precession frequency in the B ﬁeld.
During the free fall, the atoms pass through a region of large
E ﬁeld that shifts the precession frequency by an amount pro-
portional to the EDM.

(σ+) light at 556 nm. The light is tuned to the F = 1/2 →
F ′ = 1/2 hyperﬁne transition. Atoms in the the mF = +1/2
sublevel are not detected because the transition driven by σ+

the two-step process for populating the metastable 3P 0 state.
The branching ratio for decay from the 3D1 state into the 3P 0
state is 70%. The experiment would use an odd isotope with
additional hyperﬁne structure (not shown). State detection is
by excitation back to the 3D1 state.

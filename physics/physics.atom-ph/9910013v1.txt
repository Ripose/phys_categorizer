Abstract

Three-body charge transfer reactions with Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal

state are considered in the framework of coordinate-space integro-diﬀerential

Faddeev-Hahn-type equations within two- and six-state close coupling approx-

imations. The method is employed to study direct muon transfer in low-energy

collisions of the muonic hydrogen Hµ by helium (He++) and lithium (Li+++)

nuclei. The experimentally observed isotopic dependence is reproduced.

I. INTRODUCTION

Experimental investigations of the low-energy muon-transfer reactions in collisions of
muonic hydrogen Hµ (bound state of a hydrogen isotope and muon µ−) with nuclei of

charge Z1 > 1 are of importance for muon catalyzed fusion cycle [1]. The study of such

collisions involving three charged particles is also very interesting from a theoretical point of

view as an example of rearrangement scattering with Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal state.

Such reactions with post-collision Coulomb interaction between clusters appear frequently in

atomic and molecular physics [2]. In the following we develop a general formalism for dealing

with such reactions and as an example apply it to study some muon-transfer processes.

Recently, there has been considerable experimental interest in the study of the muon-

transfer reaction in collision of the muonic atoms with He++ [3,4] and also with charges

Z1 > 3 [5–9], e.g. oxygen (O8), neon (Ne10), argon (Ar18) etc. It was found that contrary

to the smooth Z-dependence expected from the semiclassical Landau-Zener formula [10] the

experimental muon transfer rates for reactions like

(Hµ)1s + XZ → XZ

µ + H

(1)

depend in a complicated manner on the charge Z [9]. Here H stands for the hydrogen isotopes

1H or 2H and XZ stands for the target nuclei. Another phenomenon which has not yet found

a satisfactory theoretical explanation is the measured isotope eﬀect, e.g. the trend of the

direct transition rates of reactions (1) for XZ = O8 [8], Ne10 [9], Ar18 [6], and Xe54 [11]. In

cases of O8, Ar18 and Xe54 the direct transfer rate decreases with increasing the mass of the H

isotope. Theoretical analyses [12] also support this trend. The experimental results for Ne10

[9] and sulphur dioxide [8] diﬀer considerably from the theoretical predictions. Moreover,

several experiments performed in recent years have put into evidence the complex structure

of the time distributions of the X-rays following transfer from muonic hydrogen isotopes to

heavier elements [13].

The proper theoretical analysis of charge transfer reaction (1) becomes extremely compli-

cated numerically as the charge Z increases because of the presence of the strong Coulomb

2

interaction in the ﬁnal state. Traditionally, in theoretical studies, such Coulombic systems

with two heavy (nuclei) and one light (muon) particles are considered within the framework

of the two-state molecular Born-Oppenheimer approximation [14,15]. In another study, a

semiclassical model based on Faddeev-type scattering equations has been used [16]. It would

be of interest to perform a full quantum mechanical consideration in view of the fact that the

muon is not so light compared to the nucleon and compare with the approximate calculations

mentioned above.

Here we develop a quantum mechanical approach based on Faddeev-Hahn-type equations

for a careful reinvestigation of these three-body direct charge-transfer reactions with strong

Coulomb repulsion in the ﬁnal state. As a ﬁrst step towards a model solution of this

complicated problem, we apply this detailed few-body method to the study of direct muon-

transfer reaction (1) for X Z = 3He++, 4He++, 6Li+++ and 7Li+++. This study with lighter

nuclei is expected to lead to faster numerical convergence than the heavier targets. However,

our approach is equally applicable for heavier targets with higher charges, although the

convergence could be slow in these cases. These studies with heavier targets would be

interesting future works.

For the three-charged-particle system, say (7Li 2H µ), only two asymptotic two-cluster

conﬁgurations are possible, i.e. (2Hµ) − 7Li and (7Liµ) − 2H. For the theoretical treatment

of such a three-body rearrangement process, Faddeev-type equations [17], especially the

modiﬁed version proposed by Hahn [18], appear to be very suitable. The two possible

asymptotic conﬁgurations of the above rearrangement problem are conveniently tackled by

a set of two coupled Faddeev-Hahn-type equations for components Ψ1 and Ψ2 of the wave

function Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2, where each component carrys the asymptotic boundary condition

for a speciﬁc conﬁguration [19,20]. These equations are very useful to incorporate distortion

potentials for speciﬁc initial and ﬁnal asymptotic states [21]. It is possible to include the ﬁnal-

state Coulomb interaction explicitly in these equations, so that a low-order approximation

to these equations produces the correct asymptotic behavior [21].

We solve the integro-diﬀerential form of the Faddeev-Hahn equation by the close-coupling

approximation scheme involving up to six states. This procedure consists in expanding the

3

wave function components Ψ1 and Ψ2 in terms of eigenfunctions of subsystem Hamiltoni-

ans in initial and ﬁnal channels, respectively. Although, these subsystem eigenfunctions are

not orthogonal to each other, the components Ψ1 and Ψ2 satisfy a coupled set of equa-

tions incorporating the correct asymptotic behavior of the wave function. Consequently,

there is no problem of overcompleteness as encountered in similar expansion approaches for

rearrangement reactions based on the Schr¨odinger equation. The resultant coupled Faddeev-

Hahn-type equations are then projected on the expansion functions. After a partial-wave

projection this leads to a set of one-dimensional coupled integro-diﬀerential equations for

the expansion coeﬃcients, which is solved numerically.

In Sec.

II we develop the formalism. We have calculated transfer rates for reaction

(1) for H = 1H or 2H and XZ = 3He++, 4He++, 6Li+++ or 7Li+++ using a two-state close-

coupling approximation, and for H = 2H and XZ =3 He++, 6Li+++ or 7Li+++ using six-state

close-coupling approximations. Our results obtained for muon-transfer rates from hydrogen

to helium and lithium are given in Sec. III and compared with those of other investigations.

We also present a summary and outlook in the concluding part of this section.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

Let us take the system of units to be e = ¯h = mµ = 1, where mµ (e) is the muonic mass

(charge), and denote, the heavy nuclei (3He, 4He, 6Li, etc.) by 1, the hydrogen isotopes

(1H, 2H or 3H) by 2 and muon by 3. Below the three-body breakup threshold, following

two-cluster asymptotic conﬁgurations are possible in the system 123: (23) − 1 and (13) − 2.

These two conﬁgurations correspond to two distinct physical channels, also denoted by 1

and 2. These conﬁgurations are determined by the Jacobi coordinates (~rj3, ~ρk)

~rj3 = ~r3 − ~rj,

~ρk = (~r3 + mj~rj)/(1 + mj) − ~rk,

j 6= k = 1, 2,

(2)

~ri, mi are coordinates and masses of the particles i = 1, 2, 3, respectively.

Let us introduce the total three-body wave function as a sum of two components

Ψ(~r1, ~r2, ~r3) = Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) + Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2),

(3)

4

where Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) is quadratically integrable over the variable ~r23, and Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) over the

variable ~r13. The components Ψ1 and Ψ2 carry the asymptotic boundary condition for

channels 1 and 2, respectively. The second component is responsible for pure Coulomb

interaction in the ﬁnal state. These components satisfy the following set of two coupled

equations

(E − H0 − V23)Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) = (V23 + V12 − UC)Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2)

(E − H0 − V13 − UC)Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) = (V13 + V12)Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) ,

where E is the center-of-mass energy, H0 is the total kinetic energy operator, and Vij(rij) are

pair-interaction potentials (i 6= j = 1, 2, 3), and UC is a distortion interaction, e.g. Coulomb

repulsion in the ﬁnal state between clusters (3He, µ) and 2H in the case of 3He 2H µ system

UC =

(Z1 − 1)Z2
ρ2

.

Here Z1 is the charge of 3He and Z2(= 1) is the charge of the hydrogen isotope. By adding

the two equations (4) we ﬁnd that they are equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation. For

energies below the three-body breakup threshold they possess the same advantages as the

Faddeev equations, since they are formulated for the wave function components with correct

physical asymptotic behavior.

This approach simpliﬁes the solution procedure and provides the correct asymptotic behavior

of the solution below the 3-body breakup threshold.

Let us write down (4) in terms of the adopted notations

For solving (9) we expand the wave function components in terms of bound states in initial

and ﬁnal channels, and project this equation on these bound states. The expansion of the

with v being the relative velocity of the incident fragments and N0 the liquid-hydrogen
density chosen here as 4.25 × 1022 cm−3, because λtr(k(1)

1 → 0) ∼ const.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We employ muonic atomic unit: distances are measured in units of aµ, where aµ is

the radius of muonic hydrogen atom. The integro-diﬀerential equations were solved by

discretizing them into a linear system of equations. The integrals in Eqs. (13) and (14)

are discretized using the trapezoidal rule and the partial derivatives are discretized using a

three-point rule [23]. The discretized equation is subsequently solved by Gauss elimination

method. As we are concerned with the low-energy limit only the total angular momentum

L = 0 is taken into account. Even at zero incident energy, the transfer channels are open

and their wave functions are rapidly oscillating Coulomb waves. In order to get a converged

solution we needed a large number of discretization points (up to 900) adequately distributed

between 0 to 40aµ. More points are taken near the origin where the interaction potentials are

large; a smaller number of points are needed at large distances. For example, near the origin

we took up to 40 equally spaced points per an unit length interval aµ, in the intermediate

region (ρ = 10 − 20aµ) we took up to 25 equally spaced points per unit length interval aµ,

and in the asymptotic region (ρ = 20 − 40aµ) we took up to 15 equally spaced points per

8

unit length interval aµ. The following mass values are used in the unit of electron mass:

m(1H) = 1836.152, m(2H) = 3670.481, m(3He) = 5495.882, m(4He) = 7294.295, m(6Li)

= 10961.892, m(7Li) = 12786.385 and the muon mass is mµ = 206.769.

We present muon-transfer rates λtr calculated using the formulation of last section for

processes (1). First, we restrict ourselves to a two-level approximation by choosing in the

relevant close-coupling expansion the hydrogen-like ground states (Hµ)1s and (XZ

µ)1s, where

H = 1H and 2H, and XZ = 3He++, 4He++, 6Li+++ and 7Li+++. Numerically stable and
converged results were obtained in these cases. The rates λtr /106 sec−1 at low energies are
presented in table 1 together with the results of [14–16]. The results in this case converged

to the precision shown in this table, except in the case of 2Hµ + 4He++, where it was diﬃcult

to get converged result. The present results are consistent with the experimentally observed

isotope eﬀect [6,9,11], e.g., the rate decreases from 1H to 2H.

In table 2 we present our results for transition rate of reaction (1) to (3He++

µ )1s, (6Li++

µ )1s

and (7Li++

µ )1s from (2Hµ)1s using the six-state close-coupling model. The six states are

Hµ(1s,2s,2p) and XZ

µ (1s,2s,2p). The results so obtained are consistent with the measured

isotope eﬀect. The eﬀect of including the (2s,2p) states in the calculational scheme is also

explicit there.

The results reported in table 1 and 2 demonstrate the eﬃciency of the present few-

body model in describing muon transfer from H isotopes to nuclei of charge Z1 = 2. Its

application to nuclei involving higher charges, therefore, is also expected to be justiﬁed.

The present calculation with 6Li+++ or 7Li+++ represents the ﬁrst examples for such a full

quantum-mechanical extension within the six-state close-coupling model.

The study of three-body charge transfer reactions with Coulomb repulsion in the ﬁnal

state has been the subject of this work. We have studied such reactions employing a detailed

few-body description of the rearrangement scattering problem by solving the Faddeev-Hahn-

type equations in coordinate space. To provide correct asymptotic form in the ﬁnal state

the pure Coulomb interaction has been incorporated directly into the equations. It is shown

that within this formalism, the application of a close-coupling-type ansatz leads to satisfac-

tory results already in low-order approximations for direct muon-transfer reactions between

9

hydrogen isotopes and light nuclei He++ and Li+++. Because of computational diﬃculties,

in this preliminary application we have considered up to six states in the expansion scheme

(1s,2s,2p on each center − (Hµ) and XZ

µ ), which may not always be adequate. Further calcu-

lations with larger basis sets are needed to obtain accurate converged results. However, the

inclusion of three basis states on each center is expected to build in a satisfactory account of

the polarization potential in the model. It has been observed [24] in studies of positron and

positronium scattering using close-coupling type approach that once the 1s,2s,2p states of

positronium and target states are included, a good account of scattering including transfer

reaction is obtained (estimated error of 10 − 20%). However, the inclusion of only the 1s

basis functions do not lead to the converged results. A similar conclusion can be obtained

from tables 1 and 2. In view of the results of ref. [24] we do not believe the results of table

2 to be very diﬀerent from the converged ones, although we cannot provide a quantitative

measure of convergence. If the above conclusion based on the works of ref. [24] hold in this

case we expect a maximum error of 20% in table 2.

Because of the present promising results for the muon-transfer rates of (1) for Z1 < 4, it

seems useful to make future applications of the present formulation for larger targets with

Z1 ≥ 4. Such calculations involving nuclei of higher charge are in progress. The present

approach should also be useful in rearrangement collision involving electron, e.g., such as in

H(1s) + He++ → H+ + He+(1s), considered in [25].

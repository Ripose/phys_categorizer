Abstract

The generation of harmonics by atoms or ions in a two-color, coplanar ﬁeld conﬁguration with

commensurate frequencies is investigated through both, an analytical calculation based on the

Lewenstein model and the numerical ab initio solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

of a two-dimensional model ion. Through the analytical model, selection rules for the harmonic

orders in this ﬁeld conﬁguration, a generalized cut-oﬀ for the harmonic spectra, and an integral

expression for the harmonic dipole strength is provided. The numerical results are employed to test

the predictions of the analytical model. The scaling of the cut-oﬀ as a function of both, one of the

laser intensities and frequency ratio η, as well as entire spectra for diﬀerent η and laser intensities

are presented and analyzed. The theoretical cut-oﬀ is found to be an upper limit for the numerical

results. Other discrepancies between analytical model and numerical results are clariﬁed by taking

into account the probabilities of the absorption processes involved.

INTRODUCTION

The possibility of obtaining high frequency radiation through the interaction of a laser

ﬁeld and an atom is a topic that has been extensively addressed during the last two decades

from both a theoretical and an experimental point of view (see [1] for recent reviews).

Harmonic generation from sources other than atoms, like linear molecules [2], ring molecules

(e.g. benzene) [3, 4], nanotubes [5], and plasmas [6] have been also investigated.

From the invariance of the Hamiltonian under dynamical symmetry operations, selection

rules for harmonic generation can be elegantly derived [3, 7]. It turns out that apparently

very diﬀerent target and ﬁeld conﬁgurations yield selection rules of the same type. Let us

consider, e.g., a ring molecule with N ions (e.g., N = 6 in the case of benzene) in a circularly

polarized laser ﬁeld of frequency ω. The electric ﬁeld vector lies in the plane that is spanned

by the molecule and which we parameterize through the polar coordinates ρ and ϕ. The

corresponding Hamiltonian (with the laser interaction taken in dipole approximation) is

invariant under the dynamical symmetry operation

.

From this invariance follows [3, 7] that only harmonics of order

n = gN

1,

±

g

∈ N+

(1)

(2)

can be emitted. The harmonic radiation is circularly polarized and subsequent harmonics

are alternately clockwise and counter-clockwise polarized. More complicated selection rules

arise when also excited states are taken into account [7]. Let us now turn to the actual

target and ﬁeld conﬁguration examined in the present paper, namely the situation of an

atom (or ion) in a circularly polarized two-color laser ﬁeld of frequencies ω and ηω with η a

positive integer number, and coplanar polarizations. In the case of counter-rotating electric

ﬁeld vectors the Hamiltonian is invariant under the same symmetry operation (1) with N

replaced by η + 1. The polar coordinates ρ and ϕ are with respect to the polarization plane

now. In the case of co-rotating electric ﬁeld vectors N has to be replaced by η

1.

−

An appealing feature of the selection rule (2) is the fact that with increasing N, i.e.,

number of ions or frequency ratio of the two laser ﬁelds, respectively, less harmonics are

emitted within a ﬁxed frequency interval. This ﬁltering eﬀect may be accompanied with more

2

eﬃcient emission of harmonics at short wavelengths which are of interest in spectroscopic

applications, for instance.

theoretically [9, 10, 11].

Harmonic generation in two-color ﬁelds has been studied both experimentally [8] and

The present paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II the theoretical modeling proposed

by Lewenstein et al. [12] for harmonic generation in the case of an atom interacting with a

single linearly polarized ﬁeld is extended to the two-color conﬁguration, and several expected

features of the harmonic spectra are deduced, among them the scaling of the cut-oﬀ and the

dependence of the relative dipole strengths within a certain harmonic couple g. In Sec. III ab

initio numerical results obtained through the integration of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger

equation for a two-dimensional model ion are presented and compared with the predictions

by the analytical model. Finally, a conclusion is given in Sec. IV.

Atomic units (a.u.) are used throughout the paper.

II. ANALYTICAL THEORY

A theory of harmonic generation should answer mainly two fundamental questions: (i)

which harmonics are emitted and (ii) which is the intensity of the harmonics as a function

of the laser and target parameters. These questions have been addressed in [12] for the

case of an atom (in the single-electron approximation) interacting with a linearly polarized

laser ﬁeld (in dipole approximation).

In a similar approach, the more general and more

complicated case of elliptical polarization was studied in [13] (single color). The elliptically

polarized two-color ﬁeld was addressed in [14] but the discussion of the cut-oﬀ law as well as

the presentation of the numerical results were restricted to linear polarization there. Here, we

focus on the case of two laser ﬁelds with circular polarizations and arbitrary integer frequency

ratios and compare carefully the model predictions with ab initio numerical simulations.

The electric ﬁeld caused by the two lasers of frequency ω1 = ω and ω2 = ηω is assumed

to be

~E(t) = (Ex(t), Ey(t), Ez(t)) = (E1 cos(ωt) + E2 cos(ηωt), E1 sin(ωt)

E2 sin(ηωt), 0)

(3)

−

where E1 and E2 are the amplitude of the ﬁrst and the second laser ﬁeld, respectively, and

the dipole approximation is applied. The two ﬁelds are oppositely polarized and coplanar.

The case of co-rotating electric ﬁeld vectors will be discussed later-on. The vector potential

In order to arrive at expression (5) several assumptions have been made in [12]: (i) among

the bound states only the ground state plays a role in the evolution of the system; (ii) the

depletion of the ground state can be neglected; (iii) in the continuum V (~r) plays no role and

The factor with inﬁnitesimal ǫ in (13) comes from the regularized Gaussian integration over

~p. It expresses quantum diﬀusion of the released wave packet and damps away contributions

from times τ much larger than a laser cycle, allowing for the extension of the τ -integration

to inﬁnity [12].

The stationary action (12) can be written in the form

Sst(t, τ ) = C0(τ ) + C1(τ ) cos ((η + 1)ω (t

τ /2))

The expression (14) for the quasi-classical action is very useful and interesting. The time

dependence is given by just one term and through only one eﬀective frequency which is

(η + 1)ω. This is consistent with the selection rule g(η + 1)

1 obtained previously. Taking

±

η = 1 and E1 = E2 = E/2 the coeﬃcients C0(τ ) and C1(τ ) calculated in [12] for the single

linearly polarized ﬁeld are easily recovered.

As the semi-classical action is the integral over time of the kinetic energy, an expression

for the energy gain of the electron is obtained by deriving Sst(t, τ ) with respect to t,

∆Ekin(t, τ ) = Ekin(t)

The value of the maximum energy gain is equal to the maximum of the function ˜C1(τ ) =

(η +1)ω

C1(τ )

. Note, that C1(τ ) depends on the product of the two electric ﬁeld amplitudes

|

|

only. If one of the two ﬁelds vanishes the resulting electric ﬁeld is a pure circularly polarized

ﬁeld and, as expected, there is no possible energy gain and therefore no harmonics are

emitted.

We introduce

which, for linear polarization and E1 = E2 = E/2, yields the well-known ponderomotive

the maximum energy gain as ∆Emax

kin = γηU one obtains for η between 1 and 5 the values

γ1 = 3.17, γ2 = 1.28, γ3 = 0.91, γ4 = 0.67, γ5 = 0.52.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

The numerical simulations were performed by integrating the time-dependent Schr¨odinger

equation on a two-dimensional (2D) grid. Reducing the grid to 2D allows to run simula-

tions quickly on every modern PC and does not introduce qualitative modiﬁcations to the

phenomena we are interested in here. Three-dimensional (3D) simulations are feasible but

signiﬁcantly more demanding. Related work on circular two-color stabilization of H in full

3D has been published recently [16].

.

(26)

The parameters α and β can be tuned in order to adjust the ionization energy and the

“smoothness” of the potential. In our simulations we used α = 2.44 and β = 0.20. These

values provide an ionization potential of Ip = 2.0, i.e., the one of real He+. The fundamental

laser frequency ω was chosen 0.02π and the pulse length was T = 12600, corresponding to

126 cycles of the frequency ω = 1.7 eV and T

300 fs.

Although the details of the model potential do not play a signiﬁcant role, at least on a

qualitative scale, it is useful to know the level scheme in order to understand resonances

observed in the numerically obtained harmonic spectra. With the chosen parameters the

lowest four excited states have energies Ω1 = 0.985, Ω2 = 1.375, Ω3 = 1.548, and Ω4 = 1.592.

R R

spectra follows the selection rule, conﬁrming the ﬁltering eﬀect, i.e., the number of harmonics

present in a certain frequency range decreases with increasing η. Additional lines of small

intensity are also present. Those lines are due either to decays from excited states which are

populated during the laser pulse or to recombinations of the electron with states diﬀerent

from the ground state. Such phenomena are also present in the interaction between a laser

ﬁeld and a circular molecule and are extensively discussed in [7]. These extra lines can be

8

particularly useful for deriving informations about energy shifts because of the dynamical

Stark eﬀect.

In order to verify the analytical ﬁndings discussed in the previous section a series of nu-

merical simulations have been performed. In particular, given a ﬁxed value for E2, a series of

simulations have been run for diﬀerent E1 and η. In Fig. 3 the highest resolvable harmonic

obtained from the simulations is compared with the highest harmonic expected from the

calculations. The interpretation of Fig. 3 is not straightforward and requires some discus-

sion. Because of angular momentum conservation, in the two-color scheme with opposite

polarizations the emission of a harmonic is possible only when

Kω −

|

Kηω|

= 1, where Kω

and Kηω are the number of photons absorbed from the ﬁrst and the second laser, respec-

tively. Therefore, in order to achieve an eﬃcient harmonic emission, it is required to ﬁnd

a regime of frequencies and ﬁeld intensities where the absorption of Kω and Kηω photons,

respectively, has a reasonably high probability. It follows that the extension of the harmonic

spectrum, as predicted by the analytical calculation, plays the role of an upper limit. In fact,

the analytical calculation in the previous section does not incorporate the actual absorption

processes and their amplitudes, but the electron is rather “put by hand” into the continuum.

This is the same for the well known case of a single linearly polarized laser where we have

the predicted cut-oﬀ at Ip + 3.17Up. However, this is veriﬁed only if the laser frequency and

intensity are chosen within proper ranges so that the laser frequency is much smaller than

Ip, and the ponderomotive energy is comparable or larger than Ip.

Finding the combination of laser parameters that yields the most eﬃcient harmonic gen-

eration is not straightforward. However, a ﬁrst hint about the most promising region in

parameter space can be obtained by considering the absorption processes from the two

lasers as independent. The three plots of the cut-oﬀ vs. ﬁeld amplitude E1, shown in Fig. 3,

were calculated for ﬁxed E2 = 0.16 and diﬀerent frequency ratios η = 3, 4, 5. The agreement

between numerical simulations and analytical calculations is particularly good for η = 5

but less satisfactory for η = 3 and η = 4 where the extension of the numerically obtained

spectrum is less than the expected cut-oﬀ. By choosing other laser intensities it is possible

to have the good agreement for, e.g., η = 3 instead of η = 5. However, the set of plots in

Fig. 3 demonstrates that it is possible to obtain harmonic spectra with signiﬁcant extension

even though the laser parameters are not precisely optimized. Note, that in Fig. 3c the

highest observable harmonic in the numerically obtained spectra is slightly greater than the

9

predicted cut-oﬀ. This is also well-known from the linearly polarized case and can be at-

tributed to the fact that in the analytical calculations it is assumed that the electron is born

and recombines exactly at the origin (where the nucleus is located). Allowing for oﬀsets

from the origin also yields harmonics beyond the calculated cut-oﬀs.

Another feature that should be noted is the asymptotic behavior of the highest observable

harmonic order in the numerical simulations.

Increasing the electric ﬁeld amplitude E1,

the probability of absorbing a certain number of photons K from the ﬁrst laser increases.

However, the emission of high harmonics requires not only the absorption of many photons

K from that laser but also the absorption of K

1 photons from the other laser. This second

±

part of the process is the real constraint. In fact, in Fig. 3 the value of E2 is always constant

and the probability of absorbing K photons decreases very rapidly with K and cannot be

compensated with the increase of the probability of absorbing K

1 photons from the ﬁrst

laser. The same eﬀect can be observed by looking at low values of E1 in Fig. 3. Here it

is the low probability of absorbing photons of frequency ω which suppresses the harmonic

generation. Summarizing, one can state that the agreement between theory and simulations

is good when the absorption processes of order (Ip + γηU)/(η + 1)

1 have a reasonably

±

±

high probability for both laser ﬁelds.

The intensity of the emitted harmonics plays, of course, a key role in harmonic generation.

Finding a conﬁguration which enhances the eﬃciency of harmonic generation is important

for possible applications because it may allow to use less intense lasers for obtaining a

desired radiation intensity. In Fig. 4 the spectra obtained with three diﬀerent values of η

are compared. The harmonics in the η = 4-spectrum are signiﬁcantly more intense than

those obtained with η = 2 over a wide range of harmonic orders, although the scaling of

the theoretical cut-oﬀ, i.e., a decreasing cut-oﬀ order with increasing η, may suggest that

the opposite should be true. However, our version of the Lewenstein model yields only an

upper limit for the cut-oﬀ. The fact that higher η is favorable here can be understood

considering that given a certain harmonic order, the number of photons required for the

emission is inverse proportional to (η + 1), and a lower order absorption process is (for the

laser parameters chosen) more likely than a higher one.

So far, only harmonic spectra for a given value of the electric ﬁeld E2 have been discussed.

In Fig. 5 we present three diﬀerent spectra obtained for diﬀerent ﬁelds E2 and keeping E1

constant. When E2 is low only a few harmonics are present. With increasing ﬁeld E2 the

10

spectrum assumes a plateau structure. Increasing E2 further leads to violent ionization and,

thus, ineﬃcient harmonic generation.

Another feature predicted by the analytical calculations in the previous section is the

intensity of the two harmonics g(η + 1)

1 of a couple g with respect to the two laser

±

intensities. From Eq.(23) and (24) follows that the intensities of the two harmonics should
be very diﬀerent for E1 ≪
dipole strengths of the two harmonics in the couple g = 2 are plotted versus E1 for η = 3

E2 and should become very close for E1 ≫

E2. In Fig. 6 the

and η = 5. The numerical result clearly conﬁrms the expected behavior. All the harmonics

in Fig. 6 are obtained through the absorption of two photons from the second laser. We have

chosen those couples because the total absorbed energy is below the ionization energy and

resonance or interference phenomena play a marginal role.

At low intensities it is possible to consider the absorption from the two lasers as two

distinct processes. Therefore we can write the probability Γ(Kω, Kηω) for the overall process

as

Γ(Kω, Kηω) = Γ(Kω)Γ(Kηω).

In terms of the generalized cross sections σKω and σKηω one has

Γ(Kω, Kηω)

Note, that in contrast to the single, linearly polarized laser ﬁeld where the nth harmonic

perturbatively scales with the nth power of the laser intensity I, here, in the two-color case,

this is not true. Given for example the [g(η + 1) + 1]th harmonic, it scales with the (g + 1)th

power of the intensity I1 and the gth power of the intensity I2. Consequently, by plotting

double-logarithmically the intensity of a certain harmonic versus E1 or E2 one expects a

straight line, the slope of which yields information about the number of photons absorbed

from that laser. Instead, if no straight line is obtained, the factorization of Eq. (27) is not

valid. In Fig. 7 the low-intensity region of Fig. 6b is plotted on a log-log scale. We see that all

the points are indeed aligned along straight lines so that (27) is an acceptable approximation

there. However, moving towards higher ﬁeld amplitudes E1 in Fig. 6 it is obvious that the

approximation (27) will soon break down.

Finally, let us brieﬂy discuss the case where the two laser ﬁelds have the same circular

polarizations and the selection rule g(η

1)

1 holds [7].

In order to achieve angular

momentum conservation in the emission process of a certain harmonic, the absorption of

−

±

11

photons from one ﬁeld has to be accompanied by the emission of photons of frequency equal

to that one of the other laser ﬁeld [10]. According to the selection rule, a frequency ratio

η = 5 in the co-rotating conﬁguration provides a spectrum with the same harmonic orders

present as with η = 3 for counter-rotating electric ﬁeld vectors. The two spectra are shown

in Fig. 8. We see that in the region around harmonic order n = 50 (oﬀ all resonances) the

intensity of the harmonics in the co-rotating case is signiﬁcantly lower (between one and two

orders of magnitude). Given a certain harmonic, the relative intensities can provide useful

information for further investigations about the absorption and emission processes.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated the generation of harmonics by atoms or ions in the two-color,

coplanar ﬁeld conﬁguration for diﬀerent values of integer frequency ratio and diﬀerent laser

intensities. Through an analytical calculation based on the Lewenstein model, the selection

rule for the harmonic orders in this ﬁeld conﬁguration, a generalized cut-oﬀ for the harmonic

spectra, and an integral expression for the harmonic dipole strength has been calculated.

Numerical ab initio simulations of a two-dimensional model ion subject to the two-color,

coplanar ﬁeld conﬁguration were performed. The numerical results did not suﬀer from the

various assumptions made in the Lewenstein model and therefore served as an important

benchmark for the theoretical predictions.

The scaling of the cut-oﬀ as a function of both, one of the laser intensities and frequency

ratio η, as well as entire spectra for diﬀerent η and laser intensities were presented and

analyzed. The theoretical cut-oﬀ was found to be an upper limit for the numerical results.

The theoretically predicted relative strength of the two harmonics g(η + 1)

1 in a certain

±

couple g = 1, 2, 3, . . . when one laser is much more intense than the other was conﬁrmed by

the numerical simulations. The dipole strength of the harmonics in general increase with

increasing η although the scaling of the theoretical cut-oﬀ, i.e., a decreasing cut-oﬀ order

with increasing η, may suggest the opposite. This was found to be due to the decreasing

order of the absorption processes involved.

Further studies can be undertaken in order to investigate the importance of resonances

within this scheme and the possibility of using such resonances for enhancing strongly the

eﬃciency of certain harmonic lines.

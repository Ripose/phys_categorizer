λ/4, λ/8, and higher order atom gratings via Raman transitions

A method is proposed for producing atom gratings having period λ/4 and λ/8 using optical
ﬁelds having wavelength λ. Counterpropagating optical ﬁelds drive Raman transitions between
ground state sublevels. The Raman ﬁelds can be described by an eﬀective two photon ﬁeld having
wave vector 2k, where k is the propagation vector of one of the ﬁelds. By combining this Raman
ﬁeld with another Raman ﬁeld having propagation vector −2k, one, in eﬀect, creates a standing
wave Raman ﬁeld whose “intensity” varies as cos(4k · r). When atoms move through this standing
wave ﬁeld, atom gratings having period λ/4 are produced, with the added possibility that the total
ground state population in a given ground state manifold can have λ/8 periodicity. The conditions
required to produce such gratings are derived. Moreover, it is shown that even higher order gratings
having periodicity smaller than λ/8 can be produced using a multicolor ﬁeld geometry involving
three (two-photon) Raman ﬁelds. Although most calculations are carried out in the Raman-Nath
approximation, the use of Raman ﬁelds to create reduced period optical lattices is also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁeld of optical coherent transients [1] had at its origin the pioneering work of Kurnit, Abella, and Hartmann on
photon echoes [2]. Since that work, Hartmann and coworkers have made a large number of signiﬁcant contributions
in both cw and transient nonlinear spectroscopy. One of us (PRB) had the good fortune to collaborate with his group
on problems related to diﬀractive scattering of atoms in superposition states [3]. There were also a number of spirited
discussions on the billiard ball model of photon echoes [4], a model which was somewhat before its time since it is
now used commonly in theoretical models of atom interferometers [5]. It is with great pleasure that we participate in
this festschrift volume to honor Sven Hartmann.

The ﬁrst wave of experiments on optical coherent transients, such as photon echoes and free precession [6], involved
coherence between diﬀerent electronic states that are coupled by an optical ﬁeld. Subsequent experiments, however,
such as the stimulated photon echo [7], employed optical ﬁelds as a means for creating coherence between ground
state sublevels (or a spatial modulation of a single ground state population). Since ground state coherences can have
decoherence times approaching seconds, rather than the tens or hundreds of nanoseconds associated with optical
transitions, ground state coherence has important applications in atom interferometry and quantum information.
There is now an extensive literature on both cw and coherent transient, ground state spectroscopy.

In recent years, both cw and pulsed optical ﬁelds have been used to control the center-of-mass motion of atoms.
Of particular interest to the current discussion is the possibility of using optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ to create
high-order matter wave gratings having period λ/2n, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 [8]. Such
matter wave gratings could serve as eﬃcient scatters of soft x-rays. There have been several schemes proposed for
achieving this goal, but most of these schemes involve several atom-ﬁeld interaction zones. Recently we showed that
it is possible to create high-order gratings in a single interaction zone using a set of counterpropagating optical ﬁelds
having diﬀerent frequencies [9]. One of the limitations of that work was set by the lifetime of the excited state of
the transition. The product of atom-ﬁeld detunings and excited state lifetime has to be much greater than unity to
satisfy certain adiabaticity requirements, and this necessitates the use of large detunings that leads to a corresponding
decrease in transition amplitudes.

These problems can be avoided if one replaces the optical transitions with ground-state, Raman transitions. A pair
of ﬁelds drives transitions from one ground state sublevel to another and acts as an eﬀective two-photon ﬁeld that is
the analogue of the single ﬁeld that drives an optical transition. In analogue with the optical case, the two-photon
ﬁeld leads to a spatially modulated Raman coherence, but not to a spatially modulated population of the ground
state sublevels [10]. However, a pair of such two-photon ﬁelds, acting as a Raman standing wave ﬁeld, leads to ground
state gratings having period λ/4. With a proper choice of ﬁeld polarization and initial conditions, the population
density in these systems can have period λ/8, even if the overall period of the matter wave gratings (including the
dependence on internal states) has periodicity λ/4. Moreover, a ﬁeld geometry involving three pairs of ﬁelds can
be used to produce gratings having period λ/4n, where n is a positive integer greater than 2. We ﬁrst describe the

1

method for producing λ/4 periodicity and then discuss brieﬂy how to extend this method to produce higher-order
gratings. The possibility of creating optical lattices having period λ/4n using these techniques is explored.

Consider an atom interacting with a ﬁeld that consists of a sum of traveling wave ﬁelds. The total electric ﬁeld

vector is given by

where Ej, ej, kj and Ωj are the amplitude, polarization, wave vector and frequency of wave j; there is a summation
convention implicit in Eq. (1) and below in which repeated indices appearing on the right-hand side of an equation
are to be summed over, except if these indices also appear on the left-hand side of the equation. The ﬁeld (1) drives
transitions between a ground-state manifold characterized by quantum numbers LG (total orbital angular momentum),
S (total spin angular momentum), JG (coupling of LG and SG), I (total nuclear spin angular momentum), G (coupling
of JG and I), mg (Zeeman quantum number), and excited-state manifold characterized by quantum numbers LH , S,

In the latter case, for alkali metal atoms having LG = 0, only K = 0 contributes to the sum. As a consequence,
one cannot couple diﬀerent ground state sublevels if the single photon detunings are larger than excited state ﬁne
structure splitting. The two-photon Raman ﬁeld acts as a scalar in this case.

III. ATOM GRATINGS

Equations (6), with the eﬀective Hamiltonian (7) are the starting point for a wide class of problems involving
both cw and transient ground state spectroscopy. If one diagonalizes the eﬀective Hamiltonian (7), he obtains the
spatially-dependent optical potentials that characterize this atom ﬁeld interaction. We will return to this point in
the Discussion. It has been assumed implicitly in Eq. (6) that r, the atomic center-of-mass coordinate, is a classical
variable; however, it is possible to generalize these equations to allow for quantization of the center-of-mass motion by
addition of a term ¯h
g /2M (M is an atomic mass) to the left hand side of Eq. (6). In this paper, we analyze
problems in which atoms are subjected to a radiation pulse whose duration is suﬃciently short to justify neglect of
this kinetic energy term (Raman-Nath approximation). The radiation pulse can occur in the laboratory frame or in
the atomic rest frame (e.g. when an atomic beam passes through a ﬁeld interaction zone). Following the interaction
region, the atomic wave function evolves freely and the kinetic energy term must be included, leading to such eﬀects
as atom focusing and Talbot rephasing, but we concentrate here on the evolution of the wavefunction only in the ﬁeld
interaction region.

∇

Even with the simpliﬁcation aﬀorded by the Raman-Nath approximation, Eqs. (6) must be solved numerically,
in general. To illustrate the relevant physics, we consider two limiting cases for which an analytic solution can be
obtained, σ+, σ− radiation and π-polarized radiation.

Let us assume that there are a number of ground state manifolds, G, G′, G′′, etc., and that a pair of optical ﬁelds
comprising our eﬀective two-photon ﬁeld drives transitions from sublevels in one manifold to sublevels in the same

or other manifolds. The key point in considering these Raman transitions is a directionality in which one couples the
initial state (or states) to the ﬁnal states by absorption from ﬁeld 1 and emission into ﬁeld 2 but not by absorption
from ﬁeld 2 and emission into ﬁeld 1. Similarly, one couples the ﬁnal states to the initial states by absorption from
ﬁeld 2 and emission into ﬁeld 1 but not by absorption from ﬁeld 1 and emission into ﬁeld 2. Some simple examples
will illustrate how this feat can be accomplished. Suppose ﬁrst that there is a single ground state manifold having
G = 1, with the initial state having mg =
1 and the ﬁnal state having mg = 1. By choosing the ﬁrst ﬁeld to have
σ+ polarization and the second ﬁeld to have σ− polarization, the ﬁrst ﬁeld couples only the initial state to the excited
states and the second ﬁeld only the ﬁnal state to the excited states. Alternatively, consider initial states in the G
manifold and ﬁnal states in the G′ manifold with
1, where τ is the interaction time. If one chooses the
τ
1 but
ﬁrst ﬁeld to have frequency Ω11 and the second ﬁeld to have frequency Ω21 such that [(Ω11 −
1, then the transition from initial to ﬁnal states can be realized only by absorption from ﬁeld 1 and
Ω11 −
|
emission into ﬁeld 2 (and not by from absorption from ﬁeld 2 and emission into ﬁeld 1).
Consequently, we assume that there are two sets of ﬁelds having frequencies Ω1j (j = 1, 2 . . . n) and Ω2j
(j = 1, 2 . . . n) from which we can form our required pairs of two-photon ﬁeld operators using one ﬁeld having frequency
Ω2j) =constant,
Ω1j and the second ﬁeld having frequency having Ω2j. To simplify matters, it is assumed that (Ω1j −
independent of j. By a proper choice of ﬁeld frequencies or polarizations, two-photon ﬁeld operators formed from any
other combination of ﬁelds are assumed to contribute negligibly to the Raman transition amplitude of interest. Of
course there will be two photon operators formed by using each ﬁeld with itself that couples any ground state level to
itself (and possibly to other, degenerate ground state sublevels within the same manifold). These operators constitute
generalized light shift operators and must be accounted for in the theory, but are not spatially dependent.

that Eq. (29) must be solved numerically, in general. Equations (29) can be solved analytically for rectangular pulses.
For pulses having arbitrary shape Eqs. (29) can be solved analytically in two limiting cases, which we refer to as
”resonant” and ”far-detuned”.

In the resonant case, one takes δ = 0 and chooses the ratio of the Rabi frequencies in such a way that SG = SG′ = 0

and T1 = T2 = T. Assuming that T is real, one ﬁnds for the population of the ﬁnal state after the pulse

In the case of single photon transitions, one can create λ

traveling wave ﬁelds that are cross polarized. For example, when oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds drive a G = 1/2
transition, they produce optical potentials for the mg =
1/2 sublevels that have period λ/2, but are shifted from one
another by λ/4. If atoms are trapped in these potentials, the ground state population has period λ/4, even though
the overall periodicity of the lattice, including dependence on magnetic state sublevels remains equal to λ/2. In the
more general case of arbitrary detunings of the cross polarized ﬁelds, an analysis of Eqs. (2) allows one to conclude
that excited state population gratings and ground state population gratings having period λ/4 can be produced if,
initially, there is no coherence between ground and excited manifolds and if, in addition, the initial state populations
are invariant with respect to reﬂection in the (x, y) plane, i. e.

It is apparent from Fig. 2 that gratings having contrast approaching unity can be produced for certain values of

Together with Eq. (47), this leads to the requirement

(2m + 1) /n = √2.

(48)

Though this equation has no solution for integer m and n, one can ﬁnd a set of integers, for which Eq.
(48) is
satisﬁed to arbitrary accuracy. This set has been generated in Ref. [13]. Values of pulse area (47) and grating contrast

IV. MULTICOLOR FIELDS

In analogy with the multicolor ﬁeld geometry for single photon transitions [9], it is possible to suppress low order
harmonics in the Raman scheme by using a geometry involving the three pairs of counterpropagating ﬁelds F =
E, E′
shown in Fig. 3, connecting an initial ground state level G to a ﬁnal
ground state level G′ via an excited state H. It is assumed that

When the Raman detunings are large,

1, basic Raman processes are suppressed; however, by choosing
n1δ1 + n2δ2 = 0, where n1 and n2 are positive integers, one can produce nearly sinusoidal, high-order gratings. For
δ2 and δ = 0, to lowest order in the atom ﬁeld coupling, there are two resonant contributions to
example, if δ1 =
G′ transition amplitude, shown schematically in Fig. 4. One contribution is associated with a two-quantum
the G
process and varies as exp (2ikz) while the other is associated with a six-quantum process and varies as exp (
6ikz) .
In contributing to the ﬁnal state probability, these terms interfere and result in a λ
8 -period population grating. For
λ
1, one can produce high-order
4(n1+n2) -period grating. By choosing
arbitrary n1 and n2 one produces a
phase gratings. The higher order gratings can simultaneously have near unity contrast and nearly sinusoidal shape
[9]. This is an important advantage of the multicolor ﬁeld technique over the basic Raman conﬁguration if one wishes
to produce nearly sinusoidal, high-order, high contrast atom gratings.

The resulting equations are completely analogous to those obtained previously for the case of single-photon transi-
tions [9] and will not be repeated here. There are two important diﬀerences between the two cases, aside from the fact
that single-photon Rabi frequencies are replaced by two-photon Rabi frequencies. In order to satisfy the adiabaticity
requirements necessary to suppress the lower harmonics, it is essential that the detunings
be larger than any rele-
vant characteristic frequencies in the problem such as decay rates or relative light shifts. In the case of single-photon
transitions this led one to choose the ﬁeld intensities such that χ2
β/∆2 = 0, where χα, χβ, ∆1, ∆2 are single
1, where γe is
photon Rabi frequencies and detunings, and to limit the pulse durations to values for which γeτ
an excited state decay rate [9]. The limitation placed on the pulse duration necessitates the use of stronger ﬁelds to
reach higher order harmonics [9]. In the case of ground state transitions, there is no longer any signiﬁcant restriction
on pulse duration since the initial and ﬁnal states are long-lived. However, the requirements on the relative light
shifts remains the same with the replacement of single photon Rabi frequencies and detunings by the corresponding
two-photon Rabi frequencies and detunings; moreover, the single photon detunings ∆(j)
H,G should be chosen to cancel
the ﬁrst-order relative light shifts.

V. DISCUSSION

It has been shown that it is possible to use optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ to create atom amplitude and phase
gratings having period λ/4 and λ/8 using a basic Raman geometry, or λ/4(n1 + n2) using a multicolor ﬁeld geometry.
Once the gratings are created, the question remains as how to image the gratings at some distance L from the atom-
ﬁeld interaction zone. This question has been addressed in detail in a previous publication [9] for both amplitude and
phase gratings. For highly collimated beams, the phase gratings evolve into a focused array of lines having spacing
λ/4(n1 + n2) which could be deposited on a substrate. For atom beams having a higher angular divergence, echo
techniques can be used to generate gratings with even smaller periodicities at speciﬁc focal planes [9]. As such, the
basic and multicolor Raman geometries oﬀer interesting possibilities for atom nanofabrication.

It is interesting to return to Eqs. (15) for cw ﬁelds. As mentioned earlier, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
correspond to the optical potentials for the ground state manifold. Since these optical potentials have period λ/4 or
smaller, the normal or multicolor Raman ﬁeld geometry can be used to produce optical lattices having this reduced
periodicity. As an illustrative example, we consider the level scheme of Sec. III D involving two ground state manifolds
with G = 1/2 and G′ = 1/2 that are connected to an excited state by four ﬁelds in the basic Raman geometry;

Ω11 = Ω1, k11 = k, e11 = ˆx

atoms are prepared in the G manifold and δ is suﬃciently large to enable one to adiabatically eliminate the G′ state
amplitudes, one ﬁnds that the ground state amplitudes in the G manifold evolve as

In other words, the mg = 1/2 sublevel is subjected to the U+ potential and the mg =
1/2 sublevel is subjected to the
U− potential. If cold atoms are trapped in these potentials the atomic density will have λ/8 periodicity. Even smaller
periodicities are possible using a multicolor geometry. Calculations of the optical potentials for more complicated level
schemes and ﬁeld geometries, such as those appropriate to the alkali metal atoms, are deferred to a future planned
publication.

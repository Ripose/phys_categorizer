(Dated: February 20, 2014)

A recent experimental study [1] of a double-δ-kicked atomic system revealed a new regime of
strong chaotic diﬀusion coupled with long-range correlations. New types of momentum diﬀusion
correlations, appearing in families coupling all kicks, were found to control transport of atoms
through trapping regions in momentum space. Here we present an analytical derivation of the
classical diﬀusion rate including all important correlations. Possible applications are also discussed:
the correlations and momentum trapping regions provide for a strong velocity selective ﬁlter eﬀect
in the atomic system.

INTRODUCTION

The ‘δ-kicked particle’ (δ-KP) is one of the most stud-
ied experimental and theoretical paradigms of classical
Hamiltonian chaos. A particle, or in an experiment usu-
ally a large ensemble of ultracold atoms, is periodically
‘kicked’ by a series of very short laser pulses, forming
an optical lattice with a sinusoidally varying potential
∞
m=1 δ(t − mT ). Here T is the kick-
V (x, t) = −K cos x
ing period, while K is the kick strength, related to the
laser intensity.

P

The classical dynamics for the δ-KP is given by the
very well-known ‘Standard Map’
[2]: by integrating
Hamilton’s equations for this potential, one obtains two
equations which may be solved iteratively to evolve the
system through each period T :

pi+1 = pi + K sin xi
xi+1 = xi + pi+1T

(1.1)

With increasing K, the system makes a transition to
fully chaotic dynamics. For K <∼ 1, chaotic diﬀusion
is bounded in momentum. For larger K, all chaotic
phase-space regions are connected and the momentum
diﬀusion is unbounded. If we neglect all correlations be-
tween impulses, ie assuming < sin xi sin xj >≃ 0 for all
kicks i,j, the momentum of a trajectory in eﬀect rep-
resents a ‘random walk’. Then the corresponding en-
ergy of an ensemble of particles grows linearly with time,
< p2
2 D0t ≃ K 2
is the uncorre-
lated momentum diﬀusion rate.

4 t, where D0 = K 2

2 >= 1

The overall diﬀusion in the chaotic regime is in gen-
eral however not uncorrelated (if K is not too large).
In [3], the eﬀect of correlations between kicks was in-
vestigated theoretically. A more accurate form for the
diﬀusion rate D ≃ K 2
2 [1 − 2J2(K) − (J1(K))2...] was ob-
tained. The 2J2(K) term is a 2-kick correction resulting
from correlations < sin xi sin xi+2 >; the last term is a
3-kick correction.

The eﬀects of these corrections on the energy absorbed,
by atoms in pulsed optical lattices, have been experimen-
tally observed [4]. Note however that for the Standard
Map, the correlations represent a simple change in the

magnitude in D; the energy increase is still linear in time.
In [5, 6] it was further shown that, if rotors are pulsed
with unequal periods, the 2-kick correlations yield a lo-
cal correction to the diﬀusion, ie D depends on both time
and the relative initial momentum, p0, between the atoms
and the standing wave of light.

However, in [1], an experimental and theoretical study
of atoms exposed to closely spaced pairs of pulses (the 2δ-
kicked particle) showed chaotic classical diﬀusion rather
diﬀerent from all other previously studied δ-kicked sys-
tems. The experimental behavior could not be analysed
within the basic framework of uncorrelated classical dif-
fusion with short-ranged (2 or 3-kick) correlations. New
corrections, which appear in families of terms, correlat-
ing all kicks were found. These long-ranged corrections
are individually very weak, but accumulate in time to
eventually dominate the diﬀusive process. This is an un-
expected situation since strong classical chaos is usually
associated with rapid decay of classical correlations in
time. Moreover, these ‘global’ correlations were associ-
ated with escape from and through momentum ‘trapping’
regions observed in the experiment.

The classical map for the 2δ-KP is only slightly diﬀer-

ent from the Standard Map:

xj+1 = xj + pjτ
pj+1 = pj + K sin xj+1
xj+2 = xj+1 + pj+1ǫ
pj+2 = pj+1 + K sin xj+2

(1.2)

where ǫ is a very short time interval between two kicks in
a pair and τ is a much longer time interval between the
pairs. It is easily seen from the map that atoms for which
p0ǫ = (2m + 1)π and m = 0, 1, ... experience an impulse
K sin x followed by another one ≃ K sin(x + π) which in
eﬀect cancels the ﬁrst. The regime p0 ≃ (2m + 1)π/ǫ
corresponds to momentum trapping regions. Conversely
in the case p0ǫ = 2mπ, a series of near-identical kicks
produces initially rapid energy growth. While some of
the experiments demonstrated this alternating trapping
and enhanced energy absorption, other experimental pa-
rameters showed the reverse: atoms prepared furthest
from the trapping regions in fact absorbed the least en-

ergy. This behavior was analysed in terms of the new
long-ranged classical correlations.

Here we present the derivations of the classical cor-
relations. In Sec.II we review the classical diﬀusion for
the Standard Map. In Sec.III, we present the study of
correlations for the 2δ-KP. In Sec.IV we conclude.

II. CLASSICAL DIFFUSION IN THE
STANDARD MAP

The classical diﬀusion corrections for the Standard
Map were originally obtained in 1980 by Rechester and
White [3]. We follow their notation closely, in this as
well as the subsequent section. From the map (1.1),
the momenta of a trajectory evolve by a sequence of im-
pulses: pN = p0 + K sin x0 + K sin x1 + ... + K sin xN −1 =
l
p0 + SN −1, where Sl =
j=0 K sin xj and p0 is the ini-
tial momentum of an atom. Furthermore, taking T = 1,
xN = xN −1 + pN = xN −1 + p0 + SN −1. If we consider an
ensemble of particles with an initial probability distribu-
tion in position and momentum G(x0, p0, t = 0), then at
a later time, the distribution is given by

The sums over n1...nt appear because of the periodicity
of phase space in x0...xt. D is now given by

By noting that K 2

2π sin xi sin xj = 0 for all i 6= j, the inte-
gral contributions to D are simply tK 2/2 and hence
D = D0 = K 2/2, the random walk as seen before. Note
that physical time is rescaled to be measured in numbers
of kicks, t = N . Higher-order corrections Cj are obtained
by setting certain mj coeﬃcients to non-zero values. In
fact only combinations |mj| = 0, 1 give terms of interest.
The main correction to the Standard Map is the 2-
kick correlation, obtained by Rechester and White and
accounts (in large measure) for the experimental oscil-
lations seen in [4]. It is obtained from setting mj = ±1
and mj−1 = ∓1. which gives integrals over the two expo-
nentials e±i(xj −xj−1−p0−Sj−1)e∓i(xj−1−xj−2−p0−Sj−2) =
e±i(xj−2xj−1+xj−2−K sin xj−1). To solve the integrals, we
+∞
use the relation, e±iK sin x =
n=−∞ Jn(K)e±inx. The
Bessel summation for xj−1 will combine with e∓2ixj−1
above to give an integral over xj−1. However there are
also integrals over e±i(xj+xj−2) for which there are no
Bessel summations. For the correlation to be non-zero,
all the arguments of the exponentials must vanish for in-
tegrals from 0 to 2π. To achieve this, one must combine
the two exponentials above with the 2K 2 sin xj sin xj−2
term (denoting the 2-kick correlation) from (St−1)2.
Hence we have for the case mj = 1 and mj−1 = −1:

In I2, n = 2 is selected in the Bessel summation to ensure
the absence of exponentials in the integral. Note that

3

there are t − 2 choices of j (with which we cancel the 1/t
prefactor). Also, the sign reversals of mj and mj−1 give
identical results, hence the correlation is doubled and we
obtain for C2:

as shown previously. We see that this term represents the
correlation between impulses sin xj and sin xj−2 only. In
the next section we will see that in the double-kicked
system there are certain new terms which represent cor-
relations between a given impulse sin xj and every other
impulse.

In the Standard Map there is no signiﬁcant 1-kick
C1 correlation. To obtain C1 we take all m = 0 ex-
cept for a single mj = ±1 which results in an exponen-
tial e±i(xj −xj−1−p0−Sj−1). We use the 2K 2 sin xj sin xj−1
term and integral I1 for variable xj such that for mj = +1

There are however two reasons why this correlation is
negligible in the Standard Map. Firstly, in an experi-
mental situation a cold atomic cloud will have a ﬁnite
initial momentum distribution of width ∆p0 ∼ 2π, so a
correlation oscillating on a comparable scale would av-
erage to zero. Secondly, while J0(0) = 1, for larger K
typically |J0(K)| < 0.5, so the correlation decays rapidly
with increasing number of kicks. For any δ-kicked sys-
tem for which all kicking periods are T ≃ 1 there are
no signiﬁcant eﬀects associated with nearest-neighbour
sin xj sin xj−1 correlations.

Again, D0 is obtained by setting all mj coeﬃcients
to zero, but it should be noted that as there are now
2t variables, the form of D0 changes to K 2 and hence
< (p − p0)2 >= D0t = K 2t. Obviously this does not
change the underlying physics; the new formula is only
due to a redeﬁnition of time in terms of number of pairs
of kicks, t = N/2. Physical time is t(τ + ǫ).

A. The kick-to-kick correlation C1

We select n = 0 in all Bessel summations for which there
is no exponential of the same variable. Combining 2.10
with its complex conjugate (mj = −1) and noting that
e+ip0 +e−ip0 = 2 cos p0 we obtain a correlation dependent

The lowest order correction to D, the 1-kick correlation
C1, is obtained by setting a single arbitrary mj coeﬃcient
to either +1 or −1 as in Sec.II. However, in contrast to
the Standard Map (and all other previously studied δ-
kicked systems) we see below that C1 is an important

correction in the 2δ-KP. For m(2)
j = ±1 the correlation in-
volves cos ǫp0 and Bessel functions of argument ǫK while
for m(1)
j = ±1 the correlation involves cos τ p0 and Bessel
functions of argument τ K. The latter case gives negligi-
ble contributions as τ is the large time interval between
pairs of kicks, resulting in both rapidly decaying J0 sum-
mations and fast oscillations with p0. We can thus ef-
fectively set all m(1)
j = 0 for the correlations presented
in this paper, a valid approximation provided τ >> ǫ.
However, if any of the m(2)
coeﬃcients is set to ±1, we
get an exponential of the form ei(x(2)
) and
its complex conjugate. The S exponential is now

Comparing this expression with 2.13 we see that in the
limit ǫ → 0, this term does not decay with time. For
small but ﬁnite ǫ, it decays very slowly with time and
may far exceed the lifetime of an experiment. Hence we
do not take the limit t → ∞, but calculate simply

It is easily seen that this saturates to a constant value of
1
as t becomes large, for J0(ǫK) ≃ 1. Saturation can
1−J 2
0
be found to occur after a time ∼ 10
(ǫK)2 . For short times
C1 grows linearly with time and one can approximate it
to K 2t cos ǫp0. In this regime the average energy of the
double-kicked particle grows linearly.

Figure 1 is the same as in [1] showing a numerical simu-
lation of the energy absorption of an ensemble of 100,000
classical particles (K = 7,ǫ = 0.05) as a function of their
initial momenta p0 at various times (measured in pairs of
kicks). The numerics are superposed with combinations
of the correlations presented here. In Figure 1a the basic
cosine behaviour of C1 is clearly visible, but when one
looks at Figures 1c and 1d something unexpected occurs:
the maxima of Figure 1a slowly turn into near minima,
while energy absorption for atoms near the ‘trapping’ re-
gions increases continuously with sharp inverted peaks
present at the centres of the trapping regions. A com-
plete reversal of the initial situation eventually occurs at
longer times: energy absorption follows a − cos ǫp0 rela-
tionship. This however is not predicted by C1.

The solution to the apparent dilemma lies in a whole
family of completely new correlation terms not observed
before. Interestingly these originate from the same equa-
tion as before for C1. However this time we combine
the exponentials with 2K 2 sin x(2)
k , where r = 1, 2
and k < j. In this way we include the correlation between
impulse sin x(2)
and every other impulse; hence we term
this a ‘global’ correlation. We obtain for m(2)

With some eﬀort it can be seen that CG1 saturates to a
value twice that of C1 at long times and initially increases
quadratically with time. The behavior of the 1-kick and
global correlations with time is shown in Figure 2 (pa-
rameters are the same as in Figure 1). At short times
CG1 is very small compared to C1 but at later times it
becomes larger than the 1-kick term. As CG1 is of op-
posite sign to C1 this now explains the cosine reversal.
At long times the ‘global’ term dominates the diﬀusive
process.

C. The Poisson correlations

Figure 1b corresponds to a regime where C1 and CG1
are of similar importance (near the crossing point in Fig-
ure 2). Here and particularly in Figure 1c another feature
mentioned earlier becomes evident. The initial minima
of Figure 1a turn into very sharp downward peaks which
are superimposed onto the overall cosine envelope. The
origin of these peaks can be seen when one realizes that
they are very reminiscent of the Poisson sum formula pre-
n(−1)n cos nǫp0 =
sented earlier (2.3) for cosine terms
m δ(ǫp0 − (2m + 1)π), which would yield peaks at the
right momenta. It is very easily seen that cos nǫp0 terms

FIG. 1: Agreement between analytical correlation terms and
numerical double-kick simulation of 100,000 classical parti-
cles at K = 7, ǫ = 0.05, for various times, measured in pairs
of kicks, t = int(N/2) where N is the number of individual
kicks. Physical time is t(τ + ǫ) where ǫ is the short time
interval between kicks in a pair and τ is the long time inter-
val between pairs. Energy absorption is plotted as a func-
tion of initial momentum of the particles. A sign reversal
of the cosine envelope and gradual disappearance of the in-
verted Poisson peaks at initial minima are seen, resulting in
the counter-intuitive situation where particles initially pre-
pared in momentum-‘trapping’ regions absorb most energy
at long times while those prepared furthest away from the
trapping regions absorb the least energy. Agreement is ex-
cellent at short times, but higher-order terms are needed at
intermediate times. At very long times CG1 dominates almost
completely.

can arise when more than one mj coeﬃcient in (3.1) is
set to a non-zero value. The various e±iǫp0 factors will
combine to give a resultant e±inǫp0 term from which a
cosine term of any order can be obtained (including zero,
i.e. momentum independent terms if the sum of the coef-
ﬁcients is zero). The most dominant higher-order terms
are those for which m(2)
j = ±1 only; values higher than
1 will introduce Bessel functions of higher order which
become increasingly smaller.

The mathematics for these higher-order Poisson terms
is much the same as shown previously, in particular it is
important to note that both types of solutions presented
(the 1-kick type and the ‘global’ type) are allowed for
all these terms. In each case the x(2)
variable is always
the only one not paired with a Bessel summation and so
has to be combined with a corresponding sine term. The
second sine can either be of one of the variables derived
from a non-zero mj coeﬃcient, for which an exponential
e±ix(r)
and a Bessel summation exists (giving a J0 − J2
factor), or one of those derived from a zero coeﬃcient

for which only a Bessel summation is present (giving a
‘global’ type 2J1 contribution). The latter group of terms
are exactly similar to CG1 and are hence termed CP n
G , the
‘global’ Poisson terms of order n. Although the former
now exist as a family of terms similar to CG1, in that due
to the presence of several non-zero mj coeﬃcients, there
is a choice of variables present for the second sine, the
terms are still mathematically more similar to C1 and
are hence termed CP n

number of variables are present in the eiS term. The ex-
act number of J1, J0 and J0 − J2 factors depend on the
pattern of mj coeﬃcients and their sums, but all Poisson
terms are similar to the forms given above. The argu-
ments of the various Bessel functions are now no longer
restricted to ǫK, but can be of any multiple of this mǫK
or rǫK, where m and r depend on the cumulative sum of
the mj coeﬃcients up to the one which accompanies the
variable from which the Bessel function is obtained. The
calculations are valid in the small Kǫ regime, for which
J1(Kǫ) ≃ Kǫ. Hence, though in theory any combination
of mj coeﬃcients of any value and Bessel functions of any
argument are possible, the dominant terms are those of
lowest order in J 2
1 .

Figure 2 also includes some of the dominant Poisson
terms in comparison to C1 and CG1. In general for every
order n, the ‘global’ type CP n
G terms eventually become
more dominant than their regular Poisson partners, but
as n increases terms become less signiﬁcant. Note that
and CP n
at the same order CP n
G are always of opposite
sign, and these signs alternate with increasing orders, as
predicted by the Poisson sum formula. Table I shows the
convergence at t = 15 (30 kicks) with increasing order of
J1 (the corresponding energy absorption is plotted in Fig
1b). The terms of order J 10
1 are about 50 times smaller
than the leading corrections.

m(2)

It must of course be remembered that it is possible to
get ‘Poisson’ terms of order n = 1 if the mj coeﬃcients
add up to 1 as for the two correlations shown in Figure 2
j = 1. These will contribute only to the
for which
overall cosine envelope and reversal but not to the Pois-
son peaks; the mathematics remain the same however as
above. CG1 is really a special case of the general CP 1
G
family of terms. The higher-order n = 1 Poisson terms
are seen to behave similarly to other Poisson orders; sig-
niﬁcance of terms decreases with O(J1).

P

It can be found that CP n
terms increase as ∼ tn, while
CP n
G terms increase as ∼ tn+1, explaining the dominance
of the latter at longer times. As n increases the diﬀerence
between the saturation values of the two terms becomes
smaller however and the ‘global’ correlation eﬀect is less
pronounced.

FIG. 2: Behavior of 1-kick, ‘global’ and lowest-order Poisson
terms with number of pairs of kicks. Time is measured in
pairs of kicks. The labels denote the Poisson order and rela-
tive importance of terms. Global terms C P n
G are shown with
circles, their Poisson partner terms C P n
1 with stars. Both
graphs use the same scales; the lower one is an inset of the
upper graph. Terms are denoted by the values of the non-zero
m(2)
coeﬃcients and the total sum of these coeﬃcients deﬁnes
j
the Poisson order. Coeﬃcients can be in any order but the cu-
mulative sum starting from highest j must never be 0 to avoid
S summations being cancelled. Each term includes the com-
plex conjugate for which all signs of coeﬃcients are reversed,
ie 1,1,-1 denotes D(mj = 1, mk = 1, ml = −1) + D(mj =
−1, mk = −1, ml = 1).
If M denotes the total number of
non-zero mj coeﬃcients, then regular Poisson terms are of
order J (2M −2)
. A
list of the terms is displayed in Table I together with val-
ues at t=15 (30 kicks). Note the linear and quadratic rise at
early times in C1 and CG1 respectively and the sign changes.
‘Global’ terms always overtake their equal-order partners af-
ter suﬃcient time, but the crossing point shifts to later times
as the order n increases. Importance of terms also decreases

IV. CONCLUSION

The correction terms derived here (C1, CG1 and Pois-
son) terms now enable us to explain the behavior seen
in Figure 1 including the inverted peaks. Agreement is
excellent for short times where only lower order corre-
lations are important. At very short times (Figure 1a)
essentially only C1, CG1 and CP 2
contribute to the ran-
dom walk and the global term is small.
In Figure 1b
all of the correlations from Figure 2 have been included
in the analytical curve and good agreement is obtained.
As the global terms start dominating the sign reversal of
the cos ǫp0 term takes place and the inverted peaks slowly
start to vanish. It is found that while the CP n
1 Poisson
terms contribute to increasing the size of the downward

1

peaks in all cases and thus favor trapping of the atoms
in mixed phase space regions, their global partners al-
ways act to oppose this. They represent the escape of
atoms from the trapping regions until eventually atoms
can travel through these regions without losing much en-
ergy.

In Figure 1c the analytical curve has been omitted as
reasonable agreement cannot be achieved using only the
correlations shown in Figure 2. Higher-order terms are
needed for which the calculations are rather tedious, but
in principle can be extended to the timescales of Fig 1c.
The overall sign reversal of the cosine envelope leads to
a situation where at long times those atoms that started
in a trapped region initially, have actually gained more
energy than those that started freely moving in a chaotic
region.

A ﬁnal remark about the double-kick system concerns
the overall momentum-independent diﬀusion D0 = K 2
(for a double-kick system). As mentioned earlier there
is a zero-order Poisson family CP
0 where the total sum
of mj coeﬃcients is zero. This eliminates the cosine de-
pendence as well as the S summation for all variables
xj for which j < jc where jc is the lowest subscript of
the non-zero mj coeﬃcients. An example of this group
of correlations is the aforementioned usual 3-kick term,
C3 = −K 2(J 2
1 (τ K)]). The ﬁrst term originates
from setting m(2)
j−1 = −1 and the second
term, which depends on τ and is hence less signiﬁcant,
from setting m(1)
1 factors

j = +1 and m(2)

j = +1 and m(1)

j−1 = −1. The J 2

appear as there are now e−ix(1)
j−1 exponentials
which are both paired with a Bessel summation for which
n = 1.

j and e−ix(2)

In this basic 3-kick term there is no summation over J0
as there is no S summation over any variables, but other
CP
0 terms will include S summations over variables for
which j > jc (ie zero-valued mj coeﬃcients in between
non-zero ones). What is noticeable is that all momentum-
independent corrections dependent solely on ǫ and many
dependent on τ are of opposite sign to D0 and thus act
to reduce the overall rate of energy absorption by the
system. In fact it is observed that D0 changes from K 2
to ≃ K 2/8 at long times as indicated by the energy values
in Figure 1.

Finally, it is worth noting the potential the double-kick
system has for atomic manipulation, for example in sys-
tems such as an atom ‘chip’ [7]. Local momentum depen-
dent diﬀusion rates can be used for ﬁltering cold atoms
according to their velocities [5]. A double-kick system
could be used to trap atoms of certain initial momenta,
while others would pass the system nearly unperturbed.
In particular, the inverted peaks of the trapping regions
could be used to select a narrow band of velocities with
p0 ≃ π/ǫ. A much stronger velocity-selective eﬀect is
seen for the double-kick system than for the system in
[5, 6] which relied on a two-kick, C2, correlation.

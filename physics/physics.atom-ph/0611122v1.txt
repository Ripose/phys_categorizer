Theory of x-ray absorption by laser-dressed atoms

Christian Buth and Robin Santra∗
Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA
(Dated: 1 November 2006)

An ab initio theory is devised for the x-ray photoabsorption cross section of atoms in the ﬁeld of a
moderately intense optical laser (1013 W
cm2 ). The laser dresses the core-excited atomic states, which
introduces a dependence of the cross section on the angle between the polarization vectors of the
two linearly polarized radiation sources. We use the Hartree-Fock-Slater approximation to describe
the atomic many-body problem in conjunction with a non-relativistic quantum-electrodynamic ap-
proach to treat the photon–electron interaction. The continuum wave functions of ejected electrons
are treated with a complex absorbing potential that is derived from smooth exterior complex scaling.
The solution to the two-color (x-ray plus laser) problem is discussed in terms of a direct diagonal-
ization of the complex symmetric matrix representation of the Hamiltonian. Alternative treatments
with time-independent and time-dependent non-Hermitian perturbation theories are presented that
exploit the weak interaction strength between x-rays and atoms. We use the theory to study the
absorption cross section of krypton atoms near the K edge. A pronounced modiﬁcation of the cross
section is found in the presence of the optical laser.

INTRODUCTION

±

The ionization of an atom by a strong optical ﬁeld
may, under suitable conditions, be described by a tun-
neling model [1]. The Ammosov-Delone-Krainov tunnel-
ing formula [2] predicts that ionization out of a sublevel
with ml = 0 is strongly preferred over ionization from
1 sublevels. Employing a relatively intense laser,
ml =
cm2 , Young et al. [3] studied laser-induced
I = 1014–1015 W
ionization of krypton atoms from the 4p sublevel. By
monitoring the 1s
4p resonance with a subsequent
x-ray pulse at a photon energy of 14.3 keV, they were
able to measure a background-free signature of the laser-
produced 4p vacancy for several angles between laser
and x-ray polarizations. The data exhibited a clear ﬁn-
gerprint of orbital alignment; yet the x-ray absorption
ratio between parallel and perpendicular polarizations
was signiﬁcantly lower than that predicted by the non-
relativistic tunneling picture [2]. By including the impact
of spin-orbit coupling in the valence shell of krypton, the
experimental ﬁndings could be explained [4].

both space and time, but keeping the laser intensity just
low enough to avoid excitation of the closed-shell atoms
in their ground state, then the eﬀect of the laser ﬁeld is
to modify the ﬁnal states that a core electron can reach
via x-ray absorption. This scenario—x-ray absorption by
laser-dressed krypton atoms—is the subject of an ongoing
experimental investigation at Argonne’s Advanced Pho-
ton Source (APS) and motivated our theoretical studies.

Certain aspects of the theory of x-ray absorption by
laser-dressed atoms were analyzed in Refs. 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Freund [5] treats the si-
multaneous absorption of one laser photon and one x-
ray-photon by solids. The absorption of x-rays by laser-
dressed hydrogen is examined in Refs. 14, 15, 17. Partic-
ularly Cionga et al. [15] and K´alm´an [14] point out the
importance of laser-dressing eﬀects close to the ionization
threshold. Leone et al. [17] and Ferrante et al. [9] study
the angular distribution of the photoelectrons. Refer-
ences 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 have in com-
mon that they treat the ﬁnal state of the excited electron
following x-ray absorption essentially as a Volkov-type
wave. Some of them include a Coulomb correction. They
do not describe the element-speciﬁc properties of the x-
ray absorption cross section in the immediate vicinity of
an inner-shell edge.

The energy spectrum of photoelectrons generated
through XUV photoionization of helium in the presence
of an intense laser ﬁelds was measured in Refs. 16, 18.
The laser-induced modiﬁcation of the x-ray absorption
near-edge structure (XANES) [19, 20] has not yet been
experimentally investigated for any dressed atom or
molecule.
In molecules, it must be expected that an
external laser ﬁeld will also have an impact on the ex-
tended x-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) [19, 20].
Therefore, in addition to its fundamental interest, under-
standing the laser-dressing eﬀect on x-ray absorption is
important from a practical point of view. For instance, if
one adiabatically aligns a molecule using an intense laser
pulse [21] and performs a XANES or EXAFS measure-
ment in order to determine molecular structure informa-
tion, then one has to be able to correct for the artiﬁcial
impact of the aligning laser pulse on the x-ray absorption
cross section.

In this paper, we devise an ab initio theory for the x-
ray absorption cross section of an isolated atom in the

presence of an optical laser. The Hartree-Fock-Slater
mean-ﬁeld model [22, 23] is utilized to treat the atomic
many-electron problem. This choice is adequate as shake-
up and shake-oﬀ eﬀects are generally weak in inner-shell
photoionization. They do not play a role in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the respective inner-shell edge. To describe
the radiation ﬁelds, we use a quantum-electrodynamic
framework which is equivalent to the semiclassical Flo-
quet theory in the limit of high laser intensities. The
coupling of the x-rays to the atom is described pertur-
batively. The laser dressing of the ﬁnal-state manifold,
however, is treated nonperturbatively. The theory is im-
plemented in terms of the program dreyd as part of
the fella package [24]. We apply our method to study
the x-ray absorption cross section of laser-dressed kryp-
ton atoms near the K edge. Its dependence on the x-ray
photon energy and on the angle between the polarization
vectors of the laser and the x-rays is investigated.

The article is structured as follows. Section II discusses
the theoretical foundation of the two-color problem of an
x-ray probe of a laser-dressed atom using an independent-
particle model for the atomic electrons, quantum elec-
trodynamics for the photons, and a complex absorbing
potential for the continuum electron. The conservation
of the energy-integrated x-ray absorption cross section
is also investigated. Subsequently, the theory is applied
to a krypton atom. Computational details are given in
Sec. III. The results are presented in Sec. IV. Conclu-
sions are drawn in Sec. V.

Our equations are formulated in atomic units. The

II. THEORY

A. Quantum electrodynamic treatment of atoms

We solve the atomic many-electron problem in terms of
a nonrelativistic one-electron model. Within this frame-
work, each electron moves in the ﬁeld of the atomic nu-
cleus and in a mean-ﬁeld generated by the other elec-
trons. The best such mean-ﬁeld derives from the Hartree-
Fock method [25]. However, the Hartree-Fock mean-ﬁeld
is nonlocal, due to the exchange interaction, and there-
fore cumbersome to work with. Slater [22] introduced
a local approximation to electron exchange, which is
the principle underlying the well-known Xα method [23].
The resulting one-electron potential, VHFS(r), is a central
potential, which satisﬁes

Within the framework of quantum electrodynam-
ics [34], the Hamiltonian describing the eﬀective one-
electron atom interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld
reads

ˆHQED = ˆHAT + ˆHEM + ˆHI .

Here,

B. Complex absorbing potential

The absorption of photons may lead to the ejection of
one or more electrons from an atom; either directly by
photoionization or by the formation and decay of elec-
tronic resonances. The ejected electrons are in the con-
tinuum and thus their wave functions are not square in-
tegrable. Therefore, they cannot be described by the
basis set expansion techniques in Hilbert space that are
frequently employed in bound-state quantum mechanics.
Several theories have been developed to make, particu-
larly, resonance states, nevertheless, amenable to a treat-
ment with methods for bound states. They typically lead
to a non-Hermitian, complex-symmetric representation
of the Hamiltonian [35, 36, 37]. In this framework, reso-
nances are characterized by a complex energy

Eres = ER −

i Γ/2 ,

(8)

which is frequently called Siegert energy [35, 38]. Here, Γ
stands for the transition rate from the speciﬁc resonance
state to the continuum in which it is embedded.

Noteworthy for this work are complex scaling [35, 36,
39] and complex absorbing potentials (CAP) [37, 40, 41,
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]
which are exact methods to determine the resonance en-
ergies (8) of a given Hamiltonian. The CAPs have been
analyzed thoroughly by Riss and Mayer [44] using com-
plex scaling. Conversely, complex scaling of the Hamil-
tonian has been used to construct a CAP that is adapted
to a speciﬁc Hamiltonian [46, 47, 50]. In all these meth-
ods, the resonance wave function associated with Eres,
Eq. (8), is square-integrable. To devise a CAP for ˆHQED
in the spirit of Refs. 46, 47, 50, we apply complex scaling
to it. This is simply a complex coordinate transforma-
tion of the Hamiltonian. Here, only the specialization to
the scaling of the radial coordinate is needed, which pro-
ceeds in complete analogy to the one-dimensional case of
Refs. 46, 50.

The radial part r =

of the electron coordinates in
spherical polar form is replaced by a path in the complex
plane ̺
F (r) [36, 39]; the resulting position vector
is ~χ = ̺(cos ϕ sin ϑ, sin ϕ sin ϑ, cos ϑ)T with the angles ϕ
and ϑ. We use the path of Moiseyev [46] in the form of

which starts at r = 0 and runs along the positive real
axis. In the vicinity of some distance r0 from the origin,
the so-called exteriority, it bends into the upper complex
plane. The bending is smooth, i.e., the path is inﬁnitely
many times continuously diﬀerentiable. The parame-
ter λ in Eq. (9) is a measure of how smooth the bending
around r0 is; it is referred to as smoothness of the path.
The exteriority is chosen such that it lies outside the
main interaction region. A complex electron coordinate
transformation of the Hamiltonian with a smooth path
is termed smooth exterior complex scaling (SES) [46].

Let us concentrate on the atomic contribution ﬁrst.
The complex scaled Hamiltonian ˆHAT can be simpliﬁed
following Karlsson [50] (please note that there are various
misprints in the equations of Ref. 50). Letting f (r) =
F ′(r), we substitute

un,l(̺) =

f (r)

(10)

.

p

With this ansatz, we deﬁne the wave function

φn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ) = µn,l(r) Yl,m(ϑ, ϕ) ,

(11)

which is related to the original wave function in Eq. (3),
upon replacing r by ̺, via

ψn,l,m(̺, ϑ, ϕ) =

φn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ) .

Applying the chain rule to rewrite the radial Schr¨odinger
equation (4) with the ansatz (10) [50], we can extract ex-
pressions for the unscaled Hamiltonian augmented by a
CAP. The CAP subsumes all corrective terms that arise
from the complex scaled kinetic energy. A further con-
tribution results from the atomic potential. If the exte-
riority r0 is chosen suﬃciently large, only the long-range
behavior of the atomic potential [cf. Eq. (1b)] is aﬀected
by complex scaling. Its contribution is added following
Ref. 56. The CAP for ˆHAT thus is given by

r0, we have f (r)

(cid:16)
In the interior, r
1 and thus the
scaled kinetic energy becomes the unscaled one such that
the corrections ˆWk vanish. Similarly, all other correction
terms in ˆW become negligible and ˆW itself vanishes. We
will assume throughout that r0 is large enough so that
the occupied atomic orbitals are unaﬀected by the CAP.
The complex coordinate transformation we carried out
modiﬁes the volume element in integrations involving
the ψn,l,m(̺, ϑ, ϕ). However, using the φn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ),
the integration measure becomes dr dΩ due to the factor
of

1
f (r) in Eq. (10); Ω stands for the solid angle.

Regarding the full Hamiltonian, ˆHQED, we note that
the free photon ﬁeld, ˆHEM, does not depend on the elec-
tronic coordinates and thus makes no contribution to ˆW .
However, the interaction part, ˆHI, has to be complex
scaled. To keep the notation transparent, we refrain
from formulating this in terms of a contribution to ˆW
and rather apply complex scaling directly.

The above CAP is referred to as smooth exterior com-
plex scaling CAP (SES-CAP). It combines the advan-
tages of simple polynomial CAPs [44] on the one hand
and complex scaling on the other hand, eliminating many
of their disadvantages. First, no optimization with re-
spect to a parameter is required for SES-CAPs to de-
termine resonance energies. Second, the construction of
a well-adapted CAP to a speciﬁc Hamiltonian is rather
straightforward.

C. X-ray probe of a laser-dressed atom

In the following, only two modes (or two colors) of
the radiation ﬁeld are considered: the laser beam with
photon energy ωL and the x-ray beam with photon en-
ergy ωX. They are assumed to be monochromatic, lin-
early polarized, and co-propagating. The polarization
vector ~eL of the laser deﬁnes the quantization axis, which
is chosen to coincide with the z-axis of the coordinate sys-
tem. Further, ~eX denotes the polarization vector of the
x-ray beam and ϑLX is the angle between ~eL and ~eX, i.e.,
~eX = cos ϑLX. Let the photon numbers in the ab-
~eL ·
sence of interaction with the atom be NL for the laser
mode and NX for the x-ray mode, respectively. The laser
intensity is then given by

with the ﬁne structure constant α. Similarly,

As other modes do not contribute—radiative correc-
tions are neglected— ˆHEM and ˆHI can be written in a

(18)

In comparison to all other interactions, the inﬂuence of
the x-ray ﬁeld may be considered as weak. We, therefore,
separate the total complex scaled Hamiltonian ˆHQED into
a strongly interacting part,

ˆH0 = ˆHAT + ˆHEM + ˆHI,L + ˆW

(19)

4

(20)

and a weakly interacting part

ˆH1 = ˆHI,X .

The SES-CAP contains the corrective terms that arise
in the complex scaling of ˆHAT. Note that ˆH0 conserves
the atomic angular momentum projection quantum num-
ber m and the number of x-ray photons NX. This par-
tition of the Hamiltonian will prove useful below when
perturbation theory is applied to the problem.

We are concerned here with the case that ωX is large
enough to drive the excitation of an electron in the K-
shell. The x-ray intensity is assumed to be low enough to
allow the description of the interaction with the atom in
terms of a one-photon absorption process. This assump-
tion is fully valid for experiments at third-generation syn-
chrotron radiation facilities such as the APS, but may
have to be modiﬁed for experiments with future free-
electron lasers. At such high photon energies, electrons
in higher-lying shells are rather insensitive to the x-ray
ﬁeld. On the other hand, inner-shell electrons are unaf-
fected by the laser. As long as the laser intensity is small
in comparison to an atomic unit, even the valence shell is
only weakly modiﬁed, and this modiﬁcation is expected
to be similar before and after the absorption of an x-ray
photon by a K-shell electron. Hence, in the one-electron
model the initial state of the system before x-ray absorp-
tion is written as

In Eq. (22), E1s is the negative of the

given by the energy of the atomic 1s orbital E1,0. Yet
E1,0 turns out to be not suﬃciently accurate [see, e.g.,
the caption of Tab. I]. To place the K edge precisely, we
replace E1,0 with the experimentally determined E1s.

In order to determine the manifold of x-ray unper-

It has been exploited in the coupling matrix ele-
ments (26b) that the laser is linearly polarized along the
z-axis of the coordinate system, i.e., in terms of spheri-
cal polar coordinates ̺ cos ϑ = ~χ T ~eL holds. Moreover,
the number of photons in the laser mode is assumed to
be much greater than one. Note that working out the
coupling matrix elements produces an extra factor

1—which is not present in Eq. (26b)—
for the cases µ
from the term ˆHI,L in ˆH ′
0. To remove this factor, we
observe that Eq. (26) forms a block-tridiagonal matrix
with respect to the photon number µ. The rows and
columns of the block matrices are labeled by the orbital
quantum numbers n, l, m and n′, l′, m, respectively. Let
U = diag(1, i 1, i2
1) be a unitary transfor-
mation, with the number of photon blocks being nph.
The unit matrices 1 have the dimension of the num-
ber of atomic basis functions ψn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ) used. Apply-
ing U to the matrix with additional
i factors, denoted
by F , yields the matrix without them, F ′ [Eq. (26)], i.e.,
U †F U = F ′. The matrix representation F ′ of ˆH ′
0 is of
the Floquet-type [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. See, for exam-
ple, Refs. 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 and references therein for
other computational approaches to atomic strong-ﬁeld
physics. Furthermore, the matrix representation (26) is
block-diagonal with respect to the projection quantum
number m because m is a conserved quantity for linearly
polarized light. Hence it is suﬃcient to focus on the sub-
blocks

All K-shell-excited states of krypton undergo rapid re-
laxation via x-ray emission; primarily by Kα ﬂuorescence.
As this relaxation pathway is a many-particle eﬀect, it
is not included in our one-particle description. To take
this eﬀect into consideration, we note that the decay of

a K-shell hole in krypton involves primarily other inner-
shell electrons; the excited electron is a spectator. It is,
therefore, reasonable to assign a width Γ1s to each ex-
cited one-particle level associated with a core hole in the
many-particle wave function. In a very good approxima-
tion, Γ1s may be assumed to be independent of the laser
ﬁeld and the quantum numbers of the spectator electron.

The matrix H represents the most general formula-
tion of the two-color problem, laser and x-rays, and can
easily be generalized to study multiphoton x-ray physics.
Although straightforward, the (partial) diagonalization
of H is quite costly. Additionally, we are interested in
the dependence of the cross section on the x-ray energy,
which requires a sampling of ωX for a range of values.
Above all, H does not immediately reveal the underly-
ing physics, i.e., the dependence on the angle between
the polarization vectors of the weak x-ray beam probing
of laser-dressed atoms and the approximate conservation
of the integrated cross section, discussed in the Secs. II F
and II G. These aspects can be addressed by a pertur-
bative treatment of the x-ray–electron interaction pur-
sued in the ensuing Secs. II D and II E. To treat the ab-
sorption of an x-ray photon perturbatively, the Hamilto-
nian ˆH ′
0 + ˆH1 is represented in the eigenbasis of the mod-
iﬁed unperturbed part H 0, i.e.,
[Eqs. (21)
{|
and (30)]. A single reference perturbation theory is now
suﬃcient because the diagonalization of H 0 already in-
corporates the strong laser-atom interaction.

The ﬁrst order correction (35b) vanishes due to the fact
that the matrix representation of the perturbation ˆH1

Alternatively, the x-ray photoabsorption rate can be
derived by judicious application of time-dependent per-
turbation theory [69] or the closely related method of the
variation of constants of Dirac [34] to approximate solu-
tions to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. Here,
we pursue the latter route. At t = 0, the system is in

is a complex scaled transition dipole matrix element be-
tween the 1s one-particle state in the atomic ground state
and the F th laser-dressed atomic state with projection
quantum number m. An expression that is formally
similar to Eq. (43) has been obtained by Rescigno et
al. [70, 71] for the photoabsorption cross section without

7

laser-dressing using a semiclassical treatment of the radi-
ation ﬁeld and time-dependent perturbation theory. The
extra factor n1s does not appear in Refs. 70, 71 because,
there, the equations are formulated using many-particle
wavefunctions. Instead, we use expressions for orbitals
and, hence, have to sum over the two equal contributions
from both K-shell electrons.

The radial part of the integrals in Eq. (44) is given by

Although we express

grand in Eq. (45) to a region near the nucleus where ̺ = r
[see Sec. II B]. The angular part of the dipole matrix el-

(50)
For vanishing laser intensity, we have σk
1s(ωX)
and thus the angular dependence disappears, i.e., the
cross section becomes a circle in a polar plot with ra-
dius σk
1s(ωX). Generally, Eq. (50) describes an ellipse in
a polar plot.

1s(ωX) = σ⊥

The origin of the diﬀerence between the cross sec-
1s(ωX) in the presence of a laser ﬁeld

1s(ωX) and σ⊥

tions σk

can be understood in terms of the structure of the Flo-
quet matrix F ′ in Eq. (26); it is block-diagonal with re-
spect to the magnetic quantum number m. Clearly, only
the block with m = 0 contains s states. Therefore, the
m = 0-block is distinguished from all other blocks of F ′.
For parallel laser and x-rays polarizations, m of the to-
tal system, Eq. (33), is a conserved quantum number.
Hence excitations out of the 1s initial state into the ﬁnal
state manifold, spanned by the eigenstates of F ′, cou-
ple exclusively to the m = 0-block, which is reﬂected
by the factor (46) in Eq. (47).
In the case of perpen-
dicular polarization vectors, m is no longer conserved;
only the ﬁnal states from the blocks of F ′ with m =
1
±
contribute. The diﬀerent structure of the blocks of F ′
leads to diﬀerent matrix elements and thus diﬀerent ﬁnal
states.

The form (50) of the angular dependence of the to-
tal cross section is obtained in electric dipole approxima-
tion for the radiation–electron interaction in the coupling
Hamiltonian (7). Electron correlations and nondipole ef-
fects, primarily for the x-rays [72], can be expected to
lead to a deviation from this formula. As it is easier to
measure a total cross section than it is to determine an
angular resolved photoelectron distribution, e.g., Ref. 72,
laser-dressing opens up another route to study such ef-
fects.

G. Conservation of the integrated cross section

we use Eqs. (25b) and (34) in conjunction with Eq. (36)

is known to converge because at photon energies much
higher than the K edge, the cross section is well known to

FIG. 1: X-ray photoabsorption cross section of the krypton
atom near the K edge with laser-dressing σ1s(ωX, ϑLX) and
without it σ1s,n.l.(ωX). The angle ϑLX is formed between the
polarization vectors of the laser and the x-rays. The laser op-
erates at a wavelength of 800 nm with an intensity of 1013 W
cm2 .

Clearly, the integrated photoabsorption cross section
does not depend on the intensity of the dressing laser
or the angle between polarization vectors of x-rays and
laser. Therefore, within the approximations made, the
integrated cross section is conserved.

III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

The theory of the previous Sec. II shall now be applied
to study the interaction of a krypton atom with two-
color light. We use the Hartree-Fock-Slater code written
by Herman and Skillman [75], which has proven advan-
tageous for atomic photoionization studies, e.g., Ref. 76,
to determine the one-particle potential VHFS(r) of kryp-
ton in Eq. (2). As in the original program of Herman
and Skillman, the Xα parameter is set to unity, in ac-
cordance with Ref. 22. The radial equation (4) is solved
using a representation of un,l(r) in terms of 3001 ﬁnite-
element functions, which span a radial grid from rmin = 0
to rmax = 60 a0. For each of the orbital angular momen-
tum quantum numbers l = 0, 1, 2, 3 considered, the low-
est 100 solutions were computed and used to form atomic
orbitals (3) in the following.

The SES-CAP is constructed using the complex
path (9). The path requires care when evaluated numeri-
cally due to the exponential functions therein. A complex
scaling angle of θ = 0.13 rad is used and the smoothness
is λ = 5 a−1
In our computations, the Hartree-Fock-
0 .
Slater atomic potential assumes the long range limit (1b)
to eight signiﬁcant digits after 3 a0, which deﬁnes the in-
ner region of the krypton atom. We choose r0 = 7 a0,
which ensures that the atomic ground state is unper-
turbed by the SES-CAP, as exploited in the derivation

FIG. 2: Diﬀerence between x-ray photoabsorption cross sec-
tions of the krypton atom near the K edge.

of Eq. (13).

The laser is assumed to operate with an optical wave-
length of 800 nm (photon energy 1.55 eV) and an inten-
sity of 1013 W
cm2 . The x-ray photon energy is varied in
the vicinity of the K edge of krypton E1s for which we
14327.17 eV of Breinig et
use the experimental value
−
al. [77]. The experimental value for the decay width of a
hole in the krypton K-shell is Γ1s = 2.7 eV [78, 79]. To
describe the laser dressing accurately, we have to include
the photon blocks with µ = 0,
5 in the Floquet
matrix (26). All basis set parameters were chosen to en-
sure converged results.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The x-ray photoabsorption cross section of krypton is
plotted in Fig. 1 for three diﬀerent cases: a) the cross
section without laser dressing, σ1s,n.l.(ωX), b) the cross
section for ϑLX = 0◦, denoted by σk
1s(ωX), and c) the
cross section for ϑLX = 90◦, denoted by σ⊥
1s(ωX). Fol-
lowing Eq. (50), the chosen angles exhibit the largest ef-
fect of the polarization dependence of the cross section of
the laser dressed atom. The impact of the laser-dressing
is most clearly reﬂected in diﬀerences of the photoab-
sorption cross section. They are shown in Fig. 2 for the
cases σ⊥
σ1s,n.l.(ωX), and
σk
1s(ωX)
Inspecting Fig. 1, we see that, beginning a few elec-
tronvolts below the K edge, the cross sections for laser
on and oﬀ are smaller than 2 kilobarns. The reason for
this is the fact that one is away from resonances for such
x-ray energies because no one-photon excitation and ion-
ization processes out of Kr 1s states are energetically al-
lowed. Excitations or ionizations of higher lying shells, L,
M, . . . , do not contribute noticeably in the energy range

the K-shell energy. The Hartree-Fock-Slater value for E1s

Outside of this range, the cross section σk

1s(ωX) behaves in
a similar way, yet, with a signiﬁcantly lower deformation
of the curve in relation to σ1s,n.l.(ωX).

To understand this behavior we need to investigate
the electronic structure in the vicinity of the ionization
threshold ﬁrst. Close to the threshold but still below are
the energies for the transitions to Rydberg states. Ex-
emplary Rydberg transition energies are listed in Tab. I.
Comparing the theoretical values to the experimental val-
ues, we ﬁnd that the Hartree-Fock-Slater approximation
describes the Rydberg orbitals, 5p, 6p, 7p, and 8p, accu-
rately. This is attributed to the property of such orbitals
to be very extended with only a small amplitude in the
vicinity of the nucleus. Consequently, the one-particle
approximation is very well justiﬁed. This reasoning is
supported additionally by the observation that the agree-
ment between theoretical and experimental energies in
Tab. I increases with increasing principal quantum num-
ber of the Rydberg orbital involved.

→

Inspecting Tab. I, we notice that the dip at 14324.82 eV
(14324.72 eV) for the black (red) curve lies very close to
the energy of the 1s
5p Rydberg transition, i.e., to the
energy of the ﬁnal state which is a 1s−1 5p conﬁguration.
In a lowest order perturbation theoretical argument,
emission of a laser photon from the 1s−1 5p conﬁguration
leads to the energy 14323.27 eV (14323.37 eV). It agrees
with the energy of 1s−1 5s conﬁguration, 14323.67 eV.
Conversely, the absorption of a laser photon from the
1s−1 5p conﬁguration leads to 14326.37 eV (14326.27 eV),
which is in the range of the energies of the 1s−1 4d and
1s−1 5d conﬁgurations, at 14325.61 eV and 14326.29 eV,
respectively. The coupling matrix elements between 5p
and higher d orbitals are small. We conclude that the
laser dressing causes a strong coupling of the 1s−1 5p con-
ﬁguration to the 1s−1 5s, 1s−1 4d, and 1s−1 5d conﬁgura-

tions, which leads to the suppression of the 1s
5p tran-
sition and an enhancement around the energies of the
1s−1 5s, 1s−1 4d, and 1s−1 5d conﬁgurations.

→

Further above the K edge, we see in Fig. 1 that the
cross sections for laser on and oﬀ are essentially the same.
Obviously, the relative importance of the energetic shift
of the continuum of ﬁnal states due to the laser-dressing,
the ponderomotive potential [80] Up = 2πα
= 0.60 eV,
decreases for increasing x-ray photon energies. This is
quantiﬁed by the quotient of Up and the energy of the
ejected electron. Clearly, the latter energy grows with
increasing x-ray energy.
In Fig. 2, above 14327.17 eV
weak wiggles with the spacing of roughly the laser photon
energy of 1.55 eV are observed.

in relation with the total deviation of the curves from
zero, an integration of the absolute value of the curves
is performed which yields 5.119 kilobarns eV (black),
1.534 kilobarns eV (red), and 3.679 kilobarns eV (blue).
We ﬁnd that the proportion of the integrated cross sec-
tion to the integrated absolute value of the cross section
is less than
0.002 for all curves. Hence, the assumptions
made in Sec. II G are fulﬁlled very well and the integrated
cross section is essentially conserved.

The photoabsorption cross section above the K edge
is displayed in Fig. 3 for a larger range of x-ray en-
ergies. The overall shape of our curve resembles the

experimental result in Fig. 1 of Schaphorst et al. [81].
However, our curves do not reach quite the same peak
19 kilobarns and they rise less steeply [our
height of
Fig. 1]. Considering the one-particle model adopted here,
the agreement is satisfactory. The photoabsorption cross
section of hydrogen atoms above the K edge is described
by a simple formula, e.g., Ref. 73,

≈

σ1s(ωX) = σ1s, a.e. ω−n
X .

(59)

For hydrogen, the exponent is n = 8/3 = 2.¯6 in the
vicinity of the edge, i.e., where the ejected electrons only
have a small fraction of the K-shell energy.
It rises to
the well-known n = 7/2 = 3.5 far away from the edge
for values of ωX that are 100 times or more the K-shell
energy [73]. Formula (59) can be expected to well approx-
imate the K-shell photoabsorption cross section of more
complex atoms like krypton [73]. We obtain the con-
stants σ1s, a.e. = 18623.8 kilobarns eVn and n = 2.63 for
the above edge behavior of the cross section in Eq. (59)
by a non-linear curve ﬁt [82] of the data in Fig. 3. The
exponent n is very close to the value derived for hydro-
gen, which corroborates the assumption that the Kr 1s
cross section is well described by this theory. Moreover,
n is consistent with a ﬁt to the experimental attenuation
cross section of krypton in Ref. 83 in the respective range.

V. CONCLUSION

We derive a formula for the x-ray photoabsorption
cross section of an atom in the light of a medium-intensity
laser in the optical wavelength regime. The laser and the
x-rays are assumed to be linearly polarized. This two-
color light eﬀects a modiﬁcation of the near-edge x-ray
absorption and a polarization dependence of the absorp-
tion cross section on the angle between the electric ﬁeld
vectors of the individual light sources.

We use the Hartree-Fock-Slater approximation to de-
scribe the atomic many-electron problem in conjunc-
tion with a non-relativistic quantum-electrodynamic ap-

to deal with continuum electrons, a complex absorbing
potential is employed that is derived using the smooth
exterior complex scaling technique. Using the eigenso-
lutions of the atom in the laser light and the number
states of the free electromagnetic ﬁelds in a product ba-
sis, a two-mode (or two-color) matrix representation of
the Hamiltonian is calculated. A direct diagonalization
of the complex symmetric matrix leads to the transition

rates for excitation out of the K shell, which are used to
calculate the cross section. Due to the relatively low in-
tensity of existing synchrotron sources, x-ray absorption
is described by a one-photon process. This is exploited
in terms of a perturbative treatment to simplify the two-
mode problem, once using a time-independent and the
other time a time-dependent derivation of the formula
for the cross section.

The theory is applied to a single krypton atom near
the K edge. A pronounced modiﬁcation of the energy-
dependent cross section is found with laser-dressing. The
modiﬁcation of the cross section depends notably on the
angle between the polarization vectors of laser and x-rays.
The decay of the cross section above the edge is found to
follow a well-known approximation, thus reassuring the
usefulness and quality of the theoretical framework. Our
theoretical predictions for krypton are presently under
experimental investigation at Argonne’s Advanced Pho-
ton Source.

Our studies oﬀer motivation and prospects for future
research. The theoretical framework of this article can
easily be extended to multiphoton x-ray processes for the
emerging x-ray free electron lasers, e.g., the Linac Coher-
ent Light Source (LCLS) [84] at the Stanford Linear Ac-
celerator Center (SLAC). Further investigations should
treat the dependence of the photoabsorption cross sec-
tion on the wavelength and intensity of the laser. More-
over, we used the electric dipole approximation in our
derivations. We expect nondipole eﬀects to cause devia-
tions from the angular dependence of our formula for the
total photoabsorption cross section. This proposed route
to study such eﬀects is in fact much easier than the con-
ventional way to measure angular distributions of photo-
electrons. Furthermore, improvements of the description
of the atomic many-particle problem oﬀer intriguing per-
spectives to study the interaction of light with correlated
electrons and the competition between the strength of
both interactions.

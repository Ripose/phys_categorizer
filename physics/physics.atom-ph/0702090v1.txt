A relativistic version of the coupled-cluster single-double (CCSD) method is developed for atoms
with a single valence electron.
In earlier work, a linearized version of the CCSD method (with
extensions to include a dominant class of triple excitations) led to accurate predictions for energies,
transition amplitudes, hyperﬁne constants, and other properties of monovalent atoms. Further
progress in high-precision atomic structure calculations for heavy atoms calls for improvement of
the linearized coupled-cluster methodology. In the present work, equations for the single and double
excitation coeﬃcients of the Dirac-Fock wave function, including all non-linear coupled-cluster terms
that contribute at the single-double level are worked out. Contributions of the non-linear terms to
energies, electric-dipole matrix elements, and hyperﬁne constants of low-lying states in alkali-metal
atoms from Li to Cs are evaluated and the results are compared with other calculations and with
precise experiments.

INTRODUCTION

A relativistic version of the coupled-cluster single-
double (CCSD) approximation for monovalent atoms is
developed. In this approximation, single and double ex-
citations of the (frozen-core) Dirac-Fock wave function
for an atom with one valence electron are included to all
orders in perturbation theory. The relativistic CCSD is
an extension of an earlier relativistic single-double (SD)
approximation,
in which all nonlinear coupled-cluster
terms were omitted. The relativistic SD approximation
provides a method closely related to the conﬁguration-
interaction method for including classes of correlation
corrections to Dirac-Fock wave functions to all-orders in
perturbation theory. When modiﬁed to include the dom-
inant triple excitations, the SD method led to accurate
predictions for energies, transition matrix elements, life-
times, hyperﬁne constants, and polarizabilities in alkali-
metal atoms (see, for example, Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).
Owing to recent improvements in the precision of atomic
experiments, it is important to go beyond the relativistic
SD approximation and include the non-linear coupled-
cluster terms.

The coupled-cluster method is an all-order extension
of many-body perturbation theory introduced into nu-
clear physics by Coester and K¨ummel [7, 8] and adapted
to atomic and molecular physics by ˇCiˇzek and Paldus
[9, 10, 11]. A comprehensive review of the coupled-
cluster method and its applications in quantum chem-
istry is given in Ref. [12]. Relativistic CCSD calcula-

tions for monovalent atoms have been carried out previ-
ously by Ynnerman et al. [13] for transition energies in
Li-like U, by Eliav et al. [14] for ionization and excita-
tion energies of alkali-metal atoms, by Lim et al. [15] for
polarizabilities of alkali-metal atoms from Li to element
119, by M˚artensson-Pendrill [16] for charge radii of fran-
cium isotopes, by Landau et al. [17] for electron aﬃnities
in alkali-metal atoms Na to element 119, by Chaudhuri
et al. [18] for ionization and excitation energies in Rb
and Cs, by Porsev and Derevianko [19] for properties
of Na, by Derevianko and Porsev [20] for properties of
Cs, and by Sahoo et al. [21] for parity nonconservation
in Cs and Ba+. Among the nonrelativistic applications
of the CCSD method to alkali-metal atoms, we mention
those of Lindgren [22] who calculated energies and hyper-
ﬁne constants of 2s and 2p states in Li and Salomonson
and Ynnerman [23] who evaluated energies and hyperﬁne
constants of 3s and 3p states in Na.

The relativistic SD method for alkali-metal atoms was
introduced in Ref. [24], where it was used to obtain en-
ergy levels, ﬁne-structure intervals, hyperﬁne constants,
and electric-dipole matrix elements in Li and Be+. Later,
the SD method was applied successfully to study proper-
ties of heavier alkali-metal atoms and monovalent ions
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Despite the success of the SD all-
order method (and its extension to include important
triples) in predicting many properties of monovalent sys-
tems, there are various instances where it fails to produce
accurate results. For example, the magnetic-dipole hy-
perﬁne constant for the 7d5/2 state of Fr calculated using

the SD method signiﬁcantly disagrees with the experi-
mental value [25]. The nd5/2 hyperﬁne constants in Cs
provide other such examples [26]. This issue is not lim-
ited to the hyperﬁne constants; correlation corrections
to electric-dipole 6dj − 6pj′ matrix elements in Rb are so
large that they change the sign of the matrix elements [4].
The large diﬀerences between third-order and all-order
values noted in Ref. [4] lead to the conclusion that the
omitted higher-order contributions are signiﬁcant. Cases
where correlation corrections are extremely large lead to
poor accuracy for the SD method, which is generally of
high-precision; in such cases, a more accurate treatment
of correlations is mandatory.

Another motivation for further development of the rel-
ativistic SD method is the study of parity nonconserva-
tion (PNC) in heavy atoms. One goal of PNC studies is
to provide atomic-physics tests of the standard model
of the electroweak interactions through determination
of the weak charge QW ; another is to extract nuclear
anapole moments from PNC measurements. A precise
calculation of the PNC amplitude (together with an un-
certainty estimate of the calculation) is necessary to de-
rive a value of the weak charge QW from experimental
measurements. The accuracy of the most advanced ex-
perimental study of PNC (which was carried out in Cs) is
0.3% [27], while the accuracy of the corresponding theo-
retical calculations is about 0.5% (see [28] and references
therein). The diﬀerence between the value of QW ex-
tracted from experiment and the value inferred from the
standard model stands at 1σ [20]. More accurate exper-
iments, coupled with improvements in the calculation of
PNC amplitude will lead to a more accurate determina-
tion of QW and a more stringent test of the standard
model.

Recently, a rather complete treatment of a class of
triple excitations that included the valence electron and
two core electrons was carried out in Refs. [19, 20] for
Na and Cs, respectively. Contributions of quadratic va-
lence non-linear terms were also calculated and found to
be relatively large. As a result, further development of
the all-order method must include a complete treatment
of the non-linear terms at the SD level.

In this work, we include all valence and core non-linear
coupled-cluster corrections to the SD equations, leading
to a complete set of CCSD equations, and we study their
eﬀects on various atomic properties of alkali-metal atoms.
In particular, we calculate ionization energies and hyper-
ﬁne constants for the ground ns states and the np1/2,
np3/2 excited states of Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. Reduced
electric-dipole matrix elements for the ns − np1/2 and
ns − np3/2 transitions are also calculated. We give a de-
tailed breakdown of various non-linear contributions in
order to identify the most important eﬀects and to mea-
sure the inﬂuence of core non-linear terms. Comparison
of our calculations with other theoretical calculations and
with experimental results is presented.

II. COUPLED-CLUSTER METHOD

In coupled-cluster theory, the wave function of an atom

with one valence electron in a state v is written as

|Ψvi = exp (S)|Φvi,

(1)

where |Φvi is the lowest-order atomic wave function for
atomic state v, which taken to be a frozen core Dirac-
Fock (DF) wave function, and where the wave operator
(the operator that maps the DF wave function onto the
exact wave function) is expressed in exponential form
exp (S). The exponential function in Eq. (1) can be ex-
panded to give

|Ψvi = (1 + S +

S2 + · · · )|Φvi.

(2)

1
2

The cluster operator S is expressed as a sum of n-particle
excitations Sn of the lowest-order wave function

S = S1 + S2 + · · · .

(3)

As the number of excitations increases, the complexity
of the wave function increases. The computational com-
plexity rises dramatically beyond the double excitation
term S2. Retaining only single and double excitations,
Eq. (2) may be written

|Ψvi = (1 + S1 + S2 +

The one-electron excitation S1 may be either an exci-

electron. Correspondingly, the single core and valence
excitations are given by

The expansion coeﬃcients ρma and ρmv are referred to
later as single core and valence excitation coeﬃcients,
while ρmnab and ρmnva are referred to as double core and
valence excitation coeﬃcients, respectively. In Eqs. (5)
and (6), a†
i and ai are creation and annihilation oper-
ators for an electron state i. Here and in subsequent
formulas, the indices from the beginning of the alphabet

the alphabet m, n, ... designate excited states, the index v

arbitrary states.

In the SD method, only terms linear in the excita-
tion coeﬃcients are retained, and all remaining terms are
omitted. Substituting Eqs. (5) and (6) into Eq. (4) and
retaining the terms linear in the excitation coeﬃcients
yields the single-double (SD) all-order wave function

The non-linear contributions to the valence correlation
energy arise from the S1cS1v, {S1vS2c, S1cS2v}, and

1cS1v terms.
We solve the SD equations using a ﬁnite basis set. Each
orbital wave function is represented as a linear combina-
tion of the B-splines. We consider a radial grid of 250
points within a sphere of radius 100 a.u. We include 35
out of 40 basis orbitals for each angular momentum and
include all partial waves with l ≤ 6 in our calculations.
A detailed description of the B-spline method is given
in Ref. [30]. We treat the non-linear terms on the same
footing with the linear terms, i.e. all the linear and non-
linear terms are iterated together. First, the equations
for the single core and double core excitation coeﬃcients
are iterated until the core correlation energy given by
Eq. (29) converges to relative accuracy ǫ = 10−5. Then,
the valence equations are iterated until the valence corre-
lation energy given by Eq. (32) converges to the relative
accuracy ǫ. Atomic properties can be evaluated once the
values of the excitation coeﬃcients are known, as brieﬂy
described below.

In general, the non-linear terms coming from expand-
ing the exponent in the CC wave function also contribute
to the expressions to matrix elements. Even at the CCSD
truncation level, one encounters an inﬁnite number of
such contributions. A rigorous method of partial sum-
mation (dressing) of the resulting series was devised in
Ref. [31]. The method is built upon expanding a prod-
uct of cluster amplitudes into a sum of n-body insertions.
Although in the present paper we do not include these
direct non-linear contributions to matrix elements, calcu-
lations [20] show that dressing may contribute as much
as a few 0.1% to hyperﬁne constants in Cs.

conducted ﬁve separate calculations for each atom. Each
subsequent calculation includes all terms in the previous
calculation together with additional terms, the eﬀect of
which is being determined. For clarity, we describe each
of the calculations below.

1. Linearized SD calculation, with all non-linear terms
omitted. The results of this calculation are listed
in the rows labeled “SD”.

2. All non-linear terms are included in the core equa-
tions only, all non-linear valence terms are omitted.
The diﬀerences of those values and the SD results
are listed in rows labeled “Core NL terms”.

3. All non-linear terms are included in the core equa-

tions and the quadratic term S2cS2v is included in
the valence equations. The diﬀerences with the cal-
culation (2) give the contributions from the non-
linear valence term S2cS2v and are listed in the rows
labeled accordingly.

4. All non-linear terms are included in the core equa-
tions, and all remaining quadratic terms are in-
cluded in the valence equations. The diﬀerences
between those values and the results of the calcu-
lation (3) give the contributions of the S1cS1v and
{S1vS2c, S1cS2v} quadratic valence terms.

5. Final calculation: all non-linear terms are included
in the core and valence equations. The results of
this calculation are listed in the rows labeled “To-
tal”. The diﬀerences between those values and
the results of the calculation (4) give the contri-
butions of the cubic and quartic non-linear terms
that are listed in rows labeled “Other valence NL
SD terms”.

In all of the cases considered here, the addition of
the non-linear terms results in a decrease in the corre-
lation contributions to the removal energies. From Table
I, we see that while the contribution of the core non-
linear terms to the removal energies is negligible com-
pared to contribution of the valence non-linear terms for
the ground states of Na, it becomes signiﬁcant (over 10%
of the total NL contribution and about 1% of the total
correlation energy) for all states of K, Rb, and Cs con-
sidered here. Furthermore, the contribution from core
NL terms is opposite in sign to that from the valence
non-linear contribution.

1cS2v}, and 1

The S2cS2v term gives the dominant nonlinear contri-
bution, as expected. More than half of the contribution
from non-linear terms to the removal energy arises from
this term. However, contributions from other quadratic
terms, S1cS1v and {S1vS2c, S1cS2v}, are also signiﬁ-
cant. Finally, the contributions from terms 1
1cS1v,
{S1vS1cS2c, 1
1cS1v, i.e. terms that are
cubic or quartic in the excitation coeﬃcients are negli-
gible. For Li and Na, contributions from these terms
are essentially zero; for K, Rb, and Cs, the contribu-
tions are less than 0.5% of the total from all non-linear
terms. The breakdown of contributions from the valence
NL terms is essentially identical for all states of Na, K,
Rb, and Cs under consideration. The total contribution
of the NL terms to the correlation energies of the lowest
three states of Na, K, Rb, and Cs is remarkably large; it
is about 1.5% of the linear SD correlation energy for Li,
5% for Na, and 9% for Cs.

In Table II, we compare of our results for the corre-
lation with the linearized all-order SD(pT) calculations
of Ref. [2], CCSD calculations of Ref. [14], the CCSD(T)
calculations of Ref. [18] and with the experimental ener-
gies [32]. The values in the rows labeled “SD” are the
sum of lowest-order (DF) energies, the SD contributions
given in Table I, and the extrapolated contributions of

the higher partial waves (Eextrap); the values in the rows
labeled “CCSD” are the sums of the DF, SD, non-linear
contributions, and Eextrap. The CCSD values should
agree with the calculation of Ref. [14] within the nu-
merical uncertainties of the calculations. Signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between all-order SD results and CCSD results
were noted earlier in Ref. [2], indicating that NL terms
may be large. In this work, we ﬁnd a good agreement be-
tween our CCSD values and the results of Ref. [14]. The
remaining discrepancies can be explained by the diﬀer-
ences in some numerical details of the calculations. In our
calculations, we truncated the number of partial waves
included in all sums over excited states at lmax = 6. Con-
tributions from partial waves with l > 6 are extrapolated
in second order (see [3] for details of the extrapolation
procedure). The resulting correction increase for heavier
alkali-metal atoms and is about 0.1% of the total energy
of 6s state in Cs. The diﬀerences between our values and
those of Ref. [14] are of the same order of magnitude as
the Eextrap contributions.

The SD approximation omits contributions to ener-
gies of third order in perturbation theory that arise from
triples excitations. These missing third-order terms were
included in the calculation of Ref. [2]. The size of this
terms is approximately given by the diﬀerences between
values listed in rows “SD” and “SD[2]”. The calcula-
tion of Ref. [14] omits these terms entirely. Interestingly,
these terms are of nearly the same magnitude as the NL
terms and of the same sign. As a result, both calculation
of Ref. [2], that omitted NL terms, and of Ref. [14], that
omitted missing third-order terms, were in quite good
It was shown in [19, 20],
agreement with experiment.
that actual iterated triple contribution signiﬁcantly dif-
fers from the third-order values. For this reason, and to
make a clear comparison with previous CCSD results, we
omit all triples contributions in this calculation. For Rb
and Cs, we also list values from the CCSD(T) calcula-
tions of Ref. [18] in the rows labeled “CCSD[18]” that
include contributions from triple excitations, but omit
the odd-parity channels.

B. Reduced electric-dipole matrix elements

Table III gives the detailed breakdown of the contri-
butions of the non-linear terms to the reduced electric-
dipole matrix elements for Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. This
table is structured in exactly the same way as Table I;
the only exception is that we added lowest-order DF
value to the linearized SD values in rows labeled “SD”.
The breakdown of the non-linear terms is identical to
the breakdown for correlation energies. The major con-
tribution comes from the term S2cS2v as in the case of
the removal energies. Also, there is almost no contribu-
tion from terms which are cubic or quartic in the exci-
tation coeﬃcients. The core non-linear terms and the
cubic and quartic valence non-linear terms decrease the
E1 reduced matrix elements, while the quadratic valence
non-linear terms increase these values. The only excep-
tion to the statement above is the contribution of the
core non-linear terms for Na which behaves in the op-
posite manner. Since the contribution of the quadratic
valence non-linear terms outweigh the contribution of all
the other terms, the ultimate eﬀect is an increase in val-
ues of the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements. As in
the case of the correlation energies, the contribution of
the NL terms is rather large, especially for heavy alka-
lies where it reaches 1.5%. The comparison of our results
with the experiment [33, 34] is also given in Table III.
Addition of non-linear terms results in a deterioration of
the agreement with experimental values as expected from
[19, 20] owing to signiﬁcant cancellation between the va-
lence NL and valence triple terms. A very interesting
ﬁnding of this work is relatively large contribution of the
core non-linear terms for heavy alkalies. While the core
non-linear term is entirely negligible for Na, it is found
to be 0.2% for Cs.

C. Hyperﬁne constants

We calculate the magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne constants
A for the ns1/2 ground states and the np1/2, np3/2 ex-
cited states of Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. The nuclear mag-
netization density is described by a Fermi distribution
with half-density radius c and 90%-10% falloﬀ thickness
t = 2.3 fm. Table IV lists values of the parameter c(fm)
used for magnetization distribution and the gyromag-
netic ratio gI for each of the alkali-metal atoms. The

S2
2 term was found to be dominant for removal energies
and electric-dipole matrix elements with other quadratic
terms being also signiﬁcant. In the case of the hyperﬁne
constants, the contributions of the other quadratic terms
exceeded that of the S2
2 term for most cases. The con-
tribution of the cubic and quartic terms was found to be
negligible in all cases considered in the present work. In-
clusion of non-linear terms in the single-double all-order
method is a signiﬁcant step toward further development
of high-precision methodologies for the calculation of the
atomic properties.

nuclear magnetic moments were taken from Ref. [35] and
weighted averages were considered when more than one
value was present.

Contributions of the various non-linear terms to the
hyperﬁne constants are given in Table V. The compari-
son of our results with experiment [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41,
42, 43] is also given. The structure of Table V is identical
to that of Table III. The “SD” values are the sum of the
lowest-order DF values and correlation correction calcu-
lated in the absence of the NL terms. Addition of the
non-linear terms resulted in a decrease in the values of
the hyperﬁne constants in comparison to the linearized
SD values. The NL core terms and the cubic and quar-
tic valence non-linear terms contribute with a positive
sign to the hyperﬁne constants, while the quadratic va-
lence non-linear terms contribute with negative sign for
K, Rb, and Cs. For Na and Li, all core and valence non-
linear terms contribute with the same sign. The most
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the NL contributions to the
hyperﬁne constants and to the removal energies and E1
matrix elements is that the contribution of the S2cS2v
terms is smaller than the contribution of the other three
quadratic valence non-linear terms S1cS1v, {S1vS2c, and
S1cS2v} for the ground states of Na, K, Rb, and Cs. The
breakdown is also diﬀerent for the ns, np1/2, and np3/2
hyperﬁne constants while it is very uniform for all ener-
gies and E1 matrix elements considered here. The con-
tributions of the core NL terms are particularly large for
the hyperﬁne constants, almost 1%(!) of the total values
for Cs.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have extended the relativistic SD method to in-
clude all non-linear terms at the SD level. The eﬀect
of the non-linear terms on the removal energies, hyper-
ﬁne constants, and electric-dipole matrix elements of the
alkali-metal atoms from Li to Cs was systematically in-
vestigated. In particular, ﬁve diﬀerent calculations were
carried out to establish the importance of the various
contributions for each alkali-metal atom. The eﬀect of
the core non-linear terms was found to be not negligible
for heavier alkalies, reaching nearly 1% of the total values
of the Cs hyperﬁne constants. Among other terms, the

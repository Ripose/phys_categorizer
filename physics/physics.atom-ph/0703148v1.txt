We report the ﬁrst accuracy evaluation of an optical lattice clock based on the 1S0 → 3P0 transition of an
alkaline earth boson, namely 88Sr atoms. This transition has been enabled using a static coupling magnetic
ﬁeld. The clock frequency is determined to be 429 228 066 418 009(32) Hz. The isotopic shift between 87Sr and
88Sr is 62 188 135 Hz with fractional uncertainty 5 × 10−7. We discuss the conditions necessary to reach a clock
accuracy of 10−17 or less using this scheme.

The recent advent of optical lattice clocks has opened
a very promising avenue for the future of atomic fre-
quency standards.1–4 Like single ion clocks5–8 they allow
to eﬃciently cancel motional eﬀects thanks to the lat-
tice conﬁnement.9 In addition, they can operate with
a large number of atoms and their expected ultimate
performance is a relative frequency noise well below
10−15 τ −1/2 (with τ the averaging time in seconds) com-
bined with a control of systematic eﬀects in the 10−18
range.10, 11 These new clocks use as a quantum refer-
ence the transition between the two lowest 1S0 and 3P0
states of alkaline-earth(-like) atoms: Sr, Yb, Mg, Ca,
Hg, etc. This transition is only slightly allowed by hy-
perﬁne quenching in the fermionic isotopes of these el-
ements, and exhibits exquisitely narrow natural widths,
in the mHz range.12–14 Most of the experimental results
demonstrated so far were obtained with fermionic 87Sr:
these include the observation of optical resonances with
Hz linewidth,4 the observation of hyperpolarizability ef-
fects,11 and accuracy evaluations progressively improved
down to 10−15.3, 15–17

→

Several proposals have been made to extend the lat-
tice clock scheme to bosonic isotopes. In the absence of
hyperﬁne structure, the true J = 0
J = 0 transition
is forbidden to all orders for a one photon excitation,
but can be enabled by adding supplementary coupling
ﬁelds.18–22 The simpler structure of the clock transition
in this case has been advocated as potentially reducing
sensitivity to some systematic shifts like ﬁrst order Zee-
man eﬀect or polarization dependence of the lattice light
shift. A further motivation of such proposals is that they
dramatically increase the number of candidate species for
lattice clocks experiments and that they oﬀer the possi-
bility to measure isotope shifts with unprecedented accu-
racy. Furthermore, interesting possibilities arise, like the
study of cold collisions in a new regime.23 So far, only
one of these schemes,20 which consists in adding a static
magnetic ﬁeld, has been experimentally demonstrated.2
The experiment was performed with 174Yb atoms and
led to the observation of sub 10 Hz resonance linewidths
and of a frequency stability below 10−14 τ −1/2.24

optical lattice clock with bosons, namely 88Sr. We use
the same simple magnetic coupling as in Ref. 20 and re-
port an experimental study of the shifts induced by the
coupling ﬁeld. The apparatus is derived from the 87Sr
optical lattice clock described in Ref. 3 Atoms are ﬁrst
loaded into a magneto-optical-trap (MOT) based on the
1P1 transition at 461 nm, while a 1D optical lat-
1S0
tice at the magic wavelength and crossing the center of
the MOT is constantly on. Thanks to two lasers tuned
to the lowest 1S0
3S1 transitions,
3P1 and 3P1
cold atoms are continuously drained into the metastable
3P0 and 3P2 states. These lasers are then switched oﬀ,
and the atoms trapped in the optical lattice are pumped
back into the ground state, where they are further cooled
3P1 tran-
to µK temperatures using the narrow 1S0
sition at 689 nm .25, 26 At this point, the coupling mag-
netic ﬁeld for the interrogation is turned on, and the
clock transition is probed using a 698 nm laser beam
from an extended cavity diode laser stabilized to a high
ﬁnesse cavity. The magnetic ﬁeld is induced by two coils
in Helmoltz conﬁguration and is parallel to the linear po-
larization of the probe laser beam. The coils are fed by a
power supply that switches from 0 to 6 A in a few ms. A
delay of 20 ms is added between the end of cooling and

bilization. The typical values used for our measurement
were a static ﬁeld B0 = 1.68 mT, an interrogation time of
20 ms, and an intensity I0 of the interrogation beam seen
by the atoms of about 6 W/cm2. The transition proba-
bility is ﬁnally measured by detecting the populations of
the 1S0 and 3P0 states after interrogation.

We made an evaluation of the frequency shifts that
are speciﬁc to this clock conﬁguration: the quadratic
Zeeman shift and the light shift due to the interroga-
tion laser. Fig. 1 shows the clock frequency as a func-
tion of the square of the coupling magnetic ﬁeld. The
latter is calibrated to within 1% by measuring the lin-
ear Zeeman shift of 87Sr. Also plotted (line) is the ex-
pected dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld as calculated
in Ref. 20 Our result is in agreement with these expec-
tations. The quadratic Zeeman shift for a magnetic ﬁeld
B0 = 1.68 mT is ∆B =

65.8(1.3) Hz.

The evaluation of the light shift due to the interro-
gation laser is not as straightforward. Both the matrix
elements that determine the light shift and the abso-
lute intensity actually seen by the atoms are diﬃcult to
determine accurately. Instead we performed frequency
measurements for various probe laser intensities which
are referenced relative to I0. The results are plotted
in Fig. 2. For intensity I0, the measured light shift is
74(11) Hz, where a conservative uncertainty of
∆L =
15% has been assigned to the relative intensity evalua-
tion.

These two shifts can in principle be related to the Rabi
frequency of the transition, Ω/2π = η√∆L∆B. Ref. 20
predicts η = 0.3 leading to an expected Rabi frequency
Ω/2π = 20.9(1.6) Hz. A direct observation of the Rabi
oscillations in the same experimental conditions is plot-
ted on Fig. 3 and gives a frequency of 16(1) Hz.

Finally, we corrected all the data for the Zeeman and
light shifts to evaluate any possible density shift. Fig. 4
shows the clock frequency as a function of the atomic
1011 at/cm3. A linear ﬁt to
density around n0 = 2.5
these data gives a frequency shift compatible with zero of

has been considered is the light shift due to the trap-
ping ﬁeld. The lattice is tuned to the magic wavelength
measured for 87Sr,11 and we made measurements for two
diﬀerent depths of the trap. No detectable eﬀect due to
the trapping light was measured.

signiﬁcant improvements have to be made. The ﬁrst
point is a reﬁned study of the eﬀect of collisions between
cold atoms. Besides that, a control of the relative laser
intensity to within 1% and of the magnetic ﬁeld to
within a few µT is certainly doable with our current
setup. However, with our 20 Hz Rabi frequency, the
accuracy would be still be limited to a few 10−15, even
if the collisional shift turns out not to be problematic
at that level. A 10−17 accuracy would therefore require
to work in a narrower linewidth (lower Rabi frequency)
regime. Assuming a state-of-the-art laser,30 we could
lower the Rabi frequency down to 0.3 Hz while remain-
ing compatible with the clock laser linewidth. Under
those conditions, the goal accuracy would be within
reach for a 6 mW/cm2 probe intensity and 500 µT
magnetic ﬁeld, but would still require a challenging
control of the probe intensity to a 10−3 level, and of the
magnetic ﬁeld at better than 0.5 µT. Magnetic shielding
as well as real time magnetic ﬁeld measurement would
3P0 clock
then probably be required. As the 1S0
→
transition is insensitive to magnetic ﬁeld at ﬁrst order,
one possibility would be to use the 1S0
3P1 transition
regularly for calibration, although great care should be
taken as this transition is sensitive to lattice trapping
ﬁeld intensity and polarization eﬀects. Alternatively, we
could switch to 87Sr from time to time.

We use the relativistic Hartree-Fock method, many-body perturbation theory and conﬁguration-
interaction method to calculate the dependence of atomic transition frequencies on the ﬁne structure
constant α = e2/¯hc. The results of these calculations will be used in the search for variation of the
ﬁne structure constant in quasar absorption spectra.

The possibility that the fundamental constants vary is
suggested by theories unifying gravity with other inter-
actions (see, e.g.
[1, 2, 3] and review [4]). The anal-
ysis of the quasar absorption spectra by means of the
many-multiplet method reveals anomalies which can be
interpreted in terms of varying ﬁne structure constant α
[5, 6, 7]. The ﬁrst indication that α might have been
smaller at early epoch came from the analysis of magne-
sium and iron lines [5, 6]. Later inclusion of other lines
belonging to many diﬀerent atoms and ions (Si, Cr, Ni,
Zn, etc.) as well as many samples of data from diﬀer-
ent gas clouds not only conﬁrmed the initial claim, but
made it even stronger [7]. However, there are some recent
works in which a similar analysis indicates no variation
of α in quasar absorption spectra [8, 9]. These works use
the same many-multiplet method and the results of our
calculations of the relativistic eﬀects in atoms, but ana-
lyze diﬀerent samples of data from a diﬀerent telescope.
It is important to include as much data as possible into
the analysis to resolve the diﬀerences, and to verify or
discard the claim of a varying ﬁne structure constant.

It is natural to analyze ﬁne structure intervals in the
search of variation of α. Indeed, initial searches of vari-
ation of α in quasar absorption spectra were based on
alkali-doublet lines (alkali-doublet method) [10, 11, 12]
and on the ﬁne structure of O III [13]. However, all of
the present evidence for varying ﬁne structure constant
has come from the analysis of the E1-transition frequen-
cies (many-multiplet method) rather than ﬁne structure
intervals. These frequencies are about an order of magni-
tude more sensitive to the variation of α [6]. However, the
corresponding analysis is much more complicated. One
needs to perform accurate ab initio calculations of the
atomic structure to reveal the dependence of transition
frequencies on the ﬁne structure constant. We have done
such calculations for many atoms and ions in our pre-
In the present work we do simi-
vious works [14, 15].
lar calculations for some other atoms and ions for which
data on quasar absorption spectra are available [16], and
for which corresponding calculations have not previously

been done.

We use relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) method as
a starting point of our calculations. Correlations are
included by means of conﬁguration-interaction (CI)
method for many valence electron atoms, or by the
many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and Brueckner-
orbital (BO) method for single valence electron atoms.
The dependence of the frequencies on α is revealed by
varying α in computer codes.

The results are presented in the form

ω = ω0 + qx,

(1)

where x = (α2/α2
0) − 1, α0 is the laboratory value of the
ﬁne structure constant, ω and ω0 are the frequencies of
the transition in quasar absorption spectra and in the
laboratory, respectively, and q is the relativistic energy
shift that comes from the calculations. Comparing the
laboratory frequencies, ω0, with those measured in the
quasar absorption spectra, ω, allows one to obtain the
value of α billions of years ago.

The method of calculations is described in detail in
our early works [14, 15]. Here we only discuss the details
speciﬁc for current calculations.

Some atoms and ions considered in the present work
represent open-shell (many valence electron) systems.
Therefore, the Hartree-Fock procedure needs to be fur-
ther speciﬁed. The natural choice is to remove all open-
shell electrons and start the Hartree-Fock calculations
for the closed-shell core. However, this usually leads to
poor convergence of the subsequent CI method. Better
convergence can be achieved using the so called V N −1
approximation in which only one valence electron is re-
moved. Since we calculate not only the ground state but
also excited states of diﬀerent conﬁgurations, it is con-
venient to remove the electron which changes its state
in the transition. Single-electron basis states for valence
electrons are calculated in the V N −1 potential of frozen-
core.

The V N −1 potential corresponds to an open-shell sys-
tem. We calculate the contribution of the open shells into
the Hartree-Fock potential as if they were totally ﬁlled
and then multiply them by a weighting coeﬃcient. Note
that this procedure must not destroy the cancellation of
the self-action (we would like to remind the reader that

there is exact cancellation between direct and exchange
self-action in the Hartree-Fock equations for the closed-
shell systems).

For the CI calculations we use B-splined single-electron
basis set similar to those developed by Johnson et al [17,
18, 19]. The main diﬀerence is that we use the open-
shell RHF Hamiltonian described above to calculate the
B-splined states.

There are two major sources of inaccuracy in the stan-
dard CI calculations. One is incompleteness of the basis
set and another is core-valence correlations. We use a
ﬁtting procedure to model both eﬀects. We add an extra
term into a single-electron part of the Hamiltonian for
the valence electrons:

Here αc is the polarizability of the atomic core and a is
a cut-oﬀ parameter which is introduced to remove the
singularity at r = 0. We use a = ab (Bohr radius) and
treat αc as a ﬁtting parameter. The values of αc for each
partial wave (s, p, d) are chosen to ﬁt the experimental
energy levels of the many-electron atom.

The term (2) describes polarization of atomic core
by valence electrons.
It can be considered as a semi-
empirical approximation to the correlation interaction of
a particular valence electron with the core. It also allows
us to improve the convergence of the CI calculations by
modifying the single-electron basis states. Our calcula-
tions for rare-earth ions [20, 21] have demonstrated that
using this term allows one to obtain good accuracy of
calculations with the minimum number of single-electron
basis states (one in each partial wave in the cited works).
Below we present the details and results of calculations
for the atoms and ions considered. All transition fre-
quencies are presented with respect to the ground state.

a transition between excited states is needed, the corre-
sponding relativistic energy shift q is the diﬀerence be-
tween the level shifts (q2→1 = q2 − q1).

a. Manganese (Z = 25): The ground state of Mn+
is 3d54s 7S3 and we need to consider transitions into
the 3d44s4p conﬁguration. Earlier we also considered
transitions to the states of the 3d54p conﬁguration [14].
Since in the present work we use diﬀerent basis set, we
have repeated calculations for this conﬁguration in order
to check their accuracy.

The RHF calculations are done in the V N −1 approxi-
mation with the 3d5 conﬁguration of external electrons.
The 4s, 4p and higher states are calculated in the same
V N −1 potential. We use αc = 2.05a3
B for the p-wave as
a ﬁtting parameter (see formula (2)). The results are
presented in Table I. Fitting changes both energies and
q-coeﬃcients by less than 10%, and agreement with pre-
vious calculations is also within 10%. Therefore, we use
10% as a conservative estimate of the accuracy of q.

Note that the relativistic shift is positive for the s − p
singe-electron transitions and negative for the d − p tran-

sitions. Having transitions with diﬀerent signs of q-
coeﬃcients in the same atom (ion) helps to ﬁght sys-
tematic errors in the search for variation of α (see, [14]
for details).

b. Titanium( Z = 22): We perform calculations for
both Ti+ and Ti2+ starting from the same RHF approxi-
mation, and using the same single-electron basis set. The
ground state of Ti+ is 3d24s 4F3/2 and we need to con-
sider transitions into states of the 3d24p conﬁguration.
The ground state of Ti2+ is 3d2 3F2 and we need to con-
sider transitions into the states of the 3d4p conﬁguration.
Therefore it is convenient to do the RHF calculations for
the Ti2+ ion with the 3d2 open-shell conﬁguration. The
4s, 4p and other basis states for the CI method are cal-
culated in the frozen-core ﬁeld of Ti2+.

The ﬁtting parameters chosen are αc = 0.38a3

B for s-
electrons and αc = 0.065a3
B for d-electrons. The results
are presented in Table II. As in the case of Mn+, there
are negative and positive relativistic shifts. The eﬀects
of ﬁtting and change of basis set does not exceed 10%.
The values of the q-coeﬃcients for titanium are consistent
with calculations for other atoms and with semi-empirical
estimations using the formulas presented in [14]. In par-
ticular, the values of the negative q-coeﬃcients for the
d − p transitions are very close to the values for simi-
lar transitions in Cr II [14]. The positive coeﬃcients for
Ti+ are very close to those for Mn+ after rescaling by Z 2
according to the semi-empirical formula [14].

c. Sodium (Z = 11):

In contrast to the ions consid-
ered above, sodium is an atom with one external electron
above closed shells. Its ground state is 1s22s22p63s 2S1/2.
Very accurate calculations are possible for such systems
by including certain types of correlation diagrams to all
orders (see, e.g. [23, 24]). However, since both relativistic
and correlation eﬀects for sodium are small we use a sim-
pliﬁed approach. We calculate the correlation potential
ˆΣ (the average value of this operator is the correlation
correction to the energy of the external electron) in the
second order only. Then we use it to modify the RHF
equations for the valence electron and to calculate the so
called Brueckner-orbitals. Note that due to iterations of
ˆΣ certain types of correlation diagrams are still included
in all orders in this procedure. The ﬁnal accuracy of the
energy is better than 1%, and for the ﬁne structure accu-
racy is 2-6% (see Table III). We believe that the accuracy
for the relativistic shifts q is on the same level.

d. Carbon (Z = 6): Relativistic eﬀects for carbon
and its ions are small and calculations can be done in
a simple way. The ground state of neutral carbon is
1s22s22p2 3P0. Since we need to consider conﬁgurations
with excitations from both 2s and 2p states, we treat

both states as valence and use the same V N −4 poten-
tial for all carbon ions and for the neutral atom. We

have checked the accuracy of this approximation for the
neutral atom by comparing the calculations with the V N
approximation. The agreement is within a few percent.
No ﬁtting was used in the calculations.

For neutral carbon we have performed the calculations
for the ground state conﬁguration 2s22p2, as well as for
excited conﬁgurations 2s22p3s, 2s2p3, 2s22p4s,2s22p3d,
2s22p4d, 2s22p5d and 2s22p6d. However, we present
in Table IV only results for the 2s22p3 conﬁguration.
The relativistic energy shift for all other conﬁgurations
is small (q < 50 cm−1). This is smaller than uncertainty
of the q-coeﬃcients for heavier atoms and ions. Since the
analysis is based on comparison of the relativistic eﬀects
in light and heavy atoms (ions), small relativistic energy
shifts in light atoms can be neglected. The q-coeﬃcients
for the 2s2p3 conﬁguration are larger because this con-
ﬁguration corresponds to the 2s − 2p transition from the
ground state. These are the lowest valence single-electron
states with the largest relativistic eﬀects. Other excited
conﬁgurations correspond to the 2p−ns or 2p−nd (n ≥ 3)
transitions. However, relativistic energy shifts for higher
states are smaller [14].

As can be seen from Table IV accuracy for the ener-
gies is within 10%. The same accuracy can probably be
assumed for the q-coeﬃcients.

e. Oxygen (Z = 8): Relativistic eﬀects for oxygen
ions are comparatively large, and become larger with in-
creasing electric charge. This is in agreement with semi-
empirical formulae presented in [14]. For neutral oxygen,
however, q-coeﬃcients are approximately 20 cm−1 or less;
these results are not presented here.

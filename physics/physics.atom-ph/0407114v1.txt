Abstract

We report on a theoretical calculation and a new experimental determination of the 1s3p 3PJ ﬁne

structure intervals in atomic 4He. The values from the theoretical calculation of 8113.730(6) MHz

and 658.801(6) MHz for the ν01 and ν12 intervals, respectively, disagree signiﬁcantly with previous

experimental results. However, the new laser spectroscopic measurement reported here yields values

of 8113.714(28) MHz and 658.810(18) MHz for these intervals. These results show an excellent

agreement with the theoretical values and resolve the apparent discrepancy between theory and

experiment.

The ﬁne structure intervals in helium have attracted a great deal of interest in recent

years because of the possibility of using a comparison between theory [1, 2] and experiment

[3, 4, 5] to better determine the ﬁne structure constant α = e2/¯hc. For example, for the

1s2p 3PJ state of helium (J = 0, 1, 2), a measurement of the large interval ν01 ≃ 29 617 MHz

to an accuracy of ±1 kHz is suﬃcient to determine α with an accuracy of ±16 ppb (parts

per billion). Unfortunately, a clear interpretation of the experiment by George et al. [3] at

this level of accuracy is clouded by a rather large 19.4 kHz disagreement between theory

and experiment for the smaller interval ν12 ≃ 2291 MHz [1].

The situation is further complicated by an apparent discrepancy of about 250 kHz between

theory and a measurement by Yang et al. [6] for the ﬁne structure splittings of the 1s3p 3PJ

state. The discrepancy is particularly troubling since all the higher order corrections, which

in principle might be responsible for the discrepancy if they were incorrect, decrease roughly

in proportion to 1/n3, where n is the principal quantum number. Consequently, they are

smaller by a factor of (2/3)3 ≃ 0.3 than in the 1s2p 3PJ state. The purpose of this paper

is to present the results of a more accurate measurement of the ﬁne structure splittings for

the 1s3p 3P state and to compare them with the theoretical values.

To a ﬁrst approximation, the various theoretical contributions to the ﬁne structure split-

tings come from the spin-orbit (so), spin-other-orbit (soo) and spin-spin (ss) terms of order

α2 Ryd. in the Breit-Pauli interaction. However, comparisons with experiment at the level

of a few kHz also require the calculation of higher order corrections of order α3, α4, α5 ln α,

and α5. The complete expression for the spin-dependent energy shift up to this order is then

of the form [1]

where Am,n and Bm,n stand for combinations of relativistic and QED operators multiplying

terms proportional to αm(ln α)n and G′ denotes the reduced Green’s function for second-

order contributions. The leading term B2,0 is the standard Breit-Pauli interaction. B3,0

2

comes from the anomalous magnetic moment and B4,0 contains the sum of 15 Douglas-Kroll

operators [7]. The terms B5,1 and B5,0 are quantum electrodynamic corrections ﬁrst derived

by Zhang [8]. The B5,1 part has been independently veriﬁed by Pachucki and Sapirstein [2].

However, the term B5,0 presents signiﬁcant theoretical challenges, and it has only partially

received independent veriﬁcation. Fortunately, this term is small enough to be neglected for

purposes this work. In addition, there are ﬁnite mass corrections to each of the above terms

involving an additional factor of µ/M or (µ/M)2 which must be taken into account, where

µ/M is the ratio of the reduced electron mass to the nuclear mass.

As discussed previously [1], the principal computational step is the calculation of the

matrix elements of the various operators in Eq. (1) with respect to high precision variational

wave functions, and the evaluation of the second-order terms. The results for the terms

up to and including order α5 ln α, and the ﬁnite mass corrections up to order α3µ/M, are

displayed in Table I. The omitted terms of order α5 and α4µ/M are known in the case

of the 1s2p 3P state of helium to give a net contribution of less than ±20 kHz. With the

1/n3 scaling, this would reduce to ±6 kHz for the 1s3p 3P state, which is the value we

take as the uncertainty due to the omitted higher-order terms. This level of accuracy is

more than suﬃcient for comparison with the accuracy of the measurements presented here.

However, a full calculation of these terms would be necessary if the experimental accuracy

were improved to ±6 kHz, and a measurement at the ±1 kHz would provide an important

test of theory and resolution of the 19.4 kHz discrepancy in ν12 for the 1s2p 3P state.

The new experimental determination of the ﬁne structure intervals reported here is based

on laser induced ﬂuorescence detection in an atomic beam. Metastable helium atoms are

produced in a RF driven discharge source that is cooled to liquid nitrogen (LN2) temperature.
Two-dimensional transverse cooling on the 1s2s 3S1 → 1s2p 3P2 transition at 1083 nm is

used to reduce the divergence of the atomic beam of metastable helium and increase its

forward intensity by a factor of 10. After passing a collimator and a ﬂight path of 180 cm

the atomic beam is ﬁnally overlapped perpendicularly with two antiparallel laser beams at

a wavelength of 389 nm to excite the 1s2s 3S1 → 1s3p 3PJ (J = 0, 1, 2) transitions. A

lens images the laser induced ﬂuorescence onto a photo-multiplier tube (PMT). The overall

eﬃciency for the photon detection is about 0.1%. The interaction region is enclosed by a

magnetic shield with an attenuation factor of 800 to minimize possible eﬀects from Zeeman

shifts.

The frequency stability and control of the 389 nm laser light is of key importance for the

accurate determination of the ﬁne structure splitting. The 389 nm light is generated through

frequency doubling of the ampliﬁed output of an external-cavity diode laser (DL1) operating

at 778 nm. The frequency of DL1 is locked to a high ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot interferometer

(FPI). A frequency tunable acousto-optic modulator (AOM) is placed between DL1 and

the FPI and works as a frequency shifter to allow for scanning the DL1 frequency relative

to a selected FPI mode. To stabilize the absolute frequency positions of the FPI modes,

the FPI is locked to a second diode laser at 778 nm (DL2), which is itself referenced to a

saturated absorption signal from an iodine cell. The iodine spectrometer provides a long-

term frequency stability of better than 15 kHz in one minute, which translates to a stability

of better than 30 kHz in one minute for the 389 nm light. Partial beams from DL1 and

DL2 are overlapped onto a fast photodiode and the resulting beat frequency is ampliﬁed and

continuously monitored by a microwave frequency counter that is referenced to a rubidium

disciplined crystal oscillator with a relative frequency uncertainty of less than 1 ppb.

of 50 µW. The dashed line is a least-square ﬁt of a Voigt proﬁle to the data. The ﬁt uncertainty

on the line center is 23 kHz. The respective residuals are shown in the lower plot.

The blue laser beam is spatially ﬁltered and expanded to a diameter of about 1 cm before

being sent through the interaction region. A retroreﬂector on the opposite side of the vacuum

chamber ensures that the counterpropagating laser beam is in exact anticollinear geometry.

This arrangement largely cancels possible Doppler shifts that would result from systematic

laser beam steering when switching between the diﬀerent transitions. Additionally, the laser

beam is carefully aligned to be exactly perpendicular to the atomic beam by matching the

resonance center position obtained with two laser beams to the one obtained when the return

beam is blocked. During the experiment, the alignment is constantly checked by monitoring

the reverse transmission of the retroreﬂected beam through the spatial ﬁlter pinhole.

To obtain a resonance curve, the blue laser frequency is scanned to cover a range of

about ±15 MHz around the ﬂuorescence maximum by discrete changes of the oscillator

frequency that drives the AOM. At each frequency step, the beat frequency and the PMT

count rate are recorded as data. Fig. 1 shows a typical example of the resonant curve

for the 1s2s 3S1 → 1s3p 3PJ transition. The PMT count is plotted as a function of the

laser frequency relative to the line center. The errors on the photon counts are not purely

statistical, but also include a 3–5% contribution from the power ﬂuctuation of the blue laser

values. A laser power of 350 µW corresponds to an intensity of ∼ 0.45 mW/cm2 or ∼ 13% of the

light during the counting gate of 0.5 s. Nonlinear least-square ﬁts to the data using a Voigt

proﬁle as a ﬁt function yield the respective center frequencies. The Voigt proﬁles ﬁt all

curves well with reduced χ2 of around one. The residuals plotted in the lower part of Fig. 1

show mainly statistical scattering around zero. The values for the ﬁne structure splittings

are obtained from the diﬀerences in the center frequencies.

Momentum transfer from the laser light to the atoms changes their transverse velocity

distribution. Since this eﬀect depends on the laser frequency, any power imbalance in the

two laser beams may result in small asymmetries of the resonance proﬁle that can lead to

systematic shifts of the ﬁne structure splitting. To minimize this eﬀect, the laser intensity is

chosen to be so low that only a few photons are scattered by each atom while transversing

the laser beam. Additionally, the ﬁne structure splitting was measured as a function of

the laser power over a range from 25 to 350 µW or about 0.9% to 13% of the saturation

intensity. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. Each data point is the mean of at

least four independent measurements. The error bars are given by the standard error of the

independent measurements and corresponds well to the error of the individual peak ﬁtting

plus the statistical ﬂuctuation of the reference laser frequency of about 20 kHz during one

measurement. Overall, the results indeed exhibit a small but noticeable power dependence

as indicated by the respective slope of the linear regression to the data. The experimental

values for the ﬁne structure intervals are therefore obtained by extrapolating to zero laser

power.

The residual magnetic ﬁeld within the interaction region was measured to be less than

3 mGauss. To get an upper estimate for a possible systematic eﬀect caused by this ﬁeld

strength, the magnetic shield was removed and a magnetic ﬁeld was deliberately applied.

An asymmetry of the Zeeman levels of up to 20% at 8 Gauss was observed. From this

measurement and a Zeeman shift of 1.4 MHz/Gauss for the 389 nm transition, it can be

inferred that the residual shift on the line center at 3 mGauss is less than 0.8 kHz. Systematic

eﬀects from light shift and pressure shift are also well below the 1 kHz level. The only

remaining eﬀect of importance is systematic laser beam steering. The relative alignment

of the counterpropagating laser beams provided by the retroreﬂecting conﬁguration has a

stability of better than 2.5 ×10−3 mrad. The maximum Doppler shift under these conditions

is 5 kHz assuming perpendicular geometry and a helium beam at LN2 temperature.

The ﬁnal experimental values for the two independent ﬁne structure intervals ν01(J =

0 → 1) and ν12(J = 1 → 2) with their respective combined statistical and systematic

uncertentainties are listed in Table II. The results of previously published measurements

on all three ﬁne structure intervals of the 1s3p 3PJ levels as well as the theoretical and

experimental result obtained in this work are compared in Fig. 3. Our experimental results

on the ﬁne structure splittings agree very well with the theoretical calculations. While there

is a clear disagreement with the results for the J = 0 → 1 and J = 1 → 2 intervals obtained

in [6], the value for J = 0 → 2 of both experiments agree very well. The previous work

was based on the measurement of the magnetic ﬁeld strength for the crossing point between

certain Zeeman sublevels. The extraction of the ﬁne structure splitting values at zero ﬁeld

requires an accurate theoretical analysis of the Zeeman shift [11]. The level crossing of the

J = 0 and J = 1 levels occurs at a considerably higher magnetic ﬁeld than the J = 0 and

J = 2 crossing. Therefore, the J = 0 → 1 measurement is more sensitive to systematic

uncertainties. Since our new experimental approach directly determines the ﬁne structure

intervals at zero ﬁeld, it avoids these complications.

In conclusion, the results from a new experiment measuring the ﬁne structure intervals

of the 1s3p 3PJ levels in atomic helium resolve an apparent discrepancy between theory and

the previous most precise experimental determination. This adds conﬁdence to the atomic

theory calculations of ﬁne structure intervals in atomic helium that serve as the basis for an

atomic physics determination of the ﬁne structure constant. For both theory and experiment

8

there is room for improvements. The current limit for theory is the uncertainty in the B5,0

QED term, which will receive further attention in the future. For the experiment, the next

step would be the introduction of a more stable reference laser and an improvement of the

laser coupling for a reduction of the systematic eﬀect caused by beam steering. Both should

enable measurements down to uncertainties of ∼ 1 kHz. At this level, results from the

1s3p 3PJ levels would ideally complement the eﬀorts in improving the 1s2p 3PJ data.

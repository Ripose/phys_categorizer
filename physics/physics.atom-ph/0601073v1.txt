Properties of quasi-one-dimensional molecules with Feshbach resonance interaction

V. A. Yurovsky

(Dated: September 25, 2013)

Bound states and collisions of atoms with two-channel two-body interactions in harmonic waveg-
uides are analyzed. The closed-channel contributions to two-atom bound states become dominant
in a case of a weak resonance. At low energies and values of the non-resonant scattering length the
problem can be approximated by a one-dimensional resonant model. Three-body problem becomes
nonintegrable and properties of three-atomic molecules become diﬀerent from ones in the integrable
Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model.

Introduction

Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) molecules, predicted in
Ref. [1], have been recently observed in experiments [2]
with two-dimensional optical lattices. Except of lattices
(see also Refs. [3, 4, 5]), a tight cylindrical conﬁnement,
or atomic waveguides, have been realized in elongated
atomic traps (see Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9] and references therein),
and atomic integrated optics devices (see Refs. [10, 11]
and references therein). Unlike weakly bound molecules
in free, three-dimensional (3D), space (see Refs. [12, 13]
and references therein), existing at positive elastic scat-
tering length only, the quasi-1D ones remain at negative
scattering length.

Interaction of two atoms in an atomic waveguide can
be considered as a 1D zero-range interaction (see Ref.
[14]) whenever the collision or binding energies remain
small compared to the transverse waveguide frequency
ω⊥. Due to coupling to excited transverse states, the
interaction strength demonstrates a resonant dependence
on the ratio of the elastic scattering length a3D to the
transverse oscillator length

a⊥ =

2
mω⊥

,

r

(1)

where m is the atomic mass. This conﬁnement-induced

resonance can been interpreted as a Feshbach resonance
(see Refs. [1, 15]), where the excited transverse states
play a role of the closed channel. The interaction strength
demonstrates also a dependence on the collision energy,
which is a common property of a resonant scattering.
This energy dependence is manifested in the scattering
amplitudes of Ref. [16], as well as in the bound state en-
ergy of Ref. [1]. However, a use of Feshbach resonance for
tuning the elastic scattering length, as in Ref. [2], leads to
additional energy dependence (see Ref. [18]), which can
be important for a weak resonance. A similar eﬀect has
been considered in Refs. [19, 20, 21, 22] for a problem of
two atoms under 3D harmonic conﬁnement.

A Feshbach resonance appears when the collision en-
ergy of an atomic pair in the open channel lies in a vicin-
ity of a bound (molecular) state in a closed channel (see

Ref. [17]). As a result, the quasi-1D molecules are su-
perpositions of the closed channel state and the ground
and excited waveguide modes of the open channel. The
closed-channel contribution becomes substantial for weak
resonances.

A theory of two-body two-channel problem under tide
cylindrical harmonic conﬁnement is summarized in Sec. I.
This problem can be approximated by a 1D two-channel
model. Improved relation between 1D and 3D scatter-
ing parameters, presented in Sec. II below, increase the
range of applicability of the 1D model compared to the
relations of Ref. [18]. Composition of quasi-1D bound
states is analyzed in Sec. III. Three-body 1D molecules
are considered in Sec. IV. A system of units with ¯h = 1
is used below.

I. FESHBACH RESONANCE IN HARMONIC
WAVEGUIDES

Properties of two-atomic systems can be described by
close-coupled equations for the wavefunction of the open
channel ψa (r) and the amplitude for the system to be in
the closed channel ψm of the form (see Ref. [18]),

Here E and r are, respectively, the energy and coordi-
nate vector of the relative motion and all the energies
are counted from the open channel threshold. For a har-
monic waveguide the conﬁnement potential has a form

where ρ and z are components of the vector r in the

tion (12) with Ueﬀ given by Eq. (19) can be obtained by
an elimination of the closed channel from Eqs. (20).

Unlike Eqs. (43)-(45) in Ref. [18], the relations (21)
demonstrate a non-linear dependence of all three param-

detuning, and resonance strength. These relations sub-
stantially increase the applicability range of 1D approx-
imation, as is demonstrated by Fig. 1 on an example of
E = 2ω⊥x2. For the con-

This equation determines poles of the 1D T -matrix (13)

considered in Ref. [24].

ω⊥/µ)], which takes into account
the resonance shift by ω⊥/µ due to conﬁnement, into
equations of Ref. [1] leads to Eq. (23) with x = 0 in
the left-hand side. This approximation, corresponding
to a single-channel conﬁned problem with an energy-
independent interaction, is called here as “open-channel
model”. Figure 1 demonstrates that this model is appli-
cable to strong resonances only.

Various approximations for the binding energy are
compared in Fig. 2 for a strong resonance. The re-
sults demonstrate good agreement between solutions of
the exact equation (23), 1D approximation (24), and
the open-channel model for B < B0 + ∆ + ω⊥/µ, when
the weak bound state exist. However, the open-channel
model predicts a non-physical singularity at B = B0 +
∆ + ω⊥/µ. Higher above the resonance the open-channel
model result tends to the energy of the deep quasi-three-
dimensional bound state. The last state is not described
by the 1D approximation. The exact equation (23) gives
both deep and weak bound states.

The 1D approximation agrees to the exact equations
also in the case of a weak resonance (see Fig. 3). However

within a small interval of B close to B0 + ∆ + ω⊥/µ.

The applicability range of the 1D approximation is im-
proved because of the approximation (15) has the root at
α = 0.294 (cf. to exact value of 0.303 and to the value of
0.468 provided by two-term approximation used in Ref.
[18]). The accuracy of binding energy demonstrates the
applicability of 1D approximation to oﬀ-shell T -matrix,
which is important for applications to many-body prob-
lems (see also discussion in Ref. [25]). The only criteria

of applicability are a < 1 and Eb ≪

in agreement with Ref.

They are independent of the Feshbach resonance pa-
rameters. Therefore,
[1], a
conﬁnement-induced resonance can be interpreted as a
two-state Feshbach resonance even for non-resonant 3D
scattering. It is a consequence of the approximation (15).
It should be noted that the closed channel involves in this
case a superposition of all transverse excitations. How-
ever, in this case the detuning D1D substantially exceeds
the transverse frequency ω⊥ and the energy-dependence
is very weak in the quasi-1D regime, whenever the energy
is less then ω⊥.

III. BOUND STATE COMPOSITION

The bound states of two atoms in atomic waveguides
are superpositions of the closed and open channels of the
Feshbach resonance. The open-channel component is a
superposition of all transverse modes. The size of the
closed-channel component is negligibly small compared
to a⊥, this component is not aﬀected by the waveguide,
and does not need an expansion in terms of the transverse
modes.

For a bound state with energy E < ω⊥ all momenta
pn, deﬁned by Eq. (8), are imaginary and the solution of
Eq. (6) has the form

˜ψn (q) =

resonances with higher or lower values of the product
ad can be called, respectively, as open-channel or closed-
channel dominated resonances, as in a case of the free
space (see Refs. [12, 13]).

Equations (37), as well as the Hamiltonian, do not
contain terms describing collisions between the closed-
channel molecule and the third atom. This assumption is
justiﬁed since the atoms in the closed and open channels
have diﬀerent hyperﬁne states and allows a simple elim-
ination of the atom-molecule channel. Following deriva-

bound states contain mostly the contributions of the open
channel. The closed channel contribution becomes domi-

diﬀerences of three-atom molecule properties from ones
in the Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model.

We propose a method for controlling a class of low temperature chemical reactions. Speciﬁcally,
we show the hydrogen abstraction channel in the reaction of formaldehyde (H2CO) and the hydroxyl
radical (OH) can be controlled through either the molecular state or an external electric ﬁeld. We
also outline experiments for investigating and demonstrating control over this important reaction.
To this end, we report the ﬁrst Stark deceleration of the H2CO molecule. We have decelerated a
molecular beam of H2CO essentially to rest, producing cold molecule packets at a temperature of
100 mK with a few million molecules in the packet at a density of ∼106 cm−3.

Recent exciting developments in ultracold matter re-
search include the creation of ultracold molecules by
magneto-association [1],
leading to molecular Bose-
Einstein condensation [2]. Despite the rich physics
demonstrated in these systems, all are characterized by
spherically symmetric interactions whose eﬀect is in-
cluded through one parameter, namely the s-wave scat-
tering length. By contrast, the permanent electric dipole
moment possessed by polar molecules permits long-range
and anisotropic interactions and enables new methods
for external control in an ultra-cold environment [3].
The electric dipole-dipole interaction (and control over
it) gives rise to unique physics and chemistry including
novel collision and chemical reaction dynamics. Lack
of spherical symmetry in the interaction causes collid-
ing molecules to be attracted or repelled depending on
their relative orientation. Thus, an external electric ﬁeld,
which orients the molecules, will have a profound eﬀect
on the molecular interactions [4]. Furthermore, because
the transition states of a chemical reaction often involve
speciﬁc orientations of the molecular dipoles, an exter-
nal electric ﬁeld may shift the energy barrier to reaction,
making a particular reaction pathway more or less favor-
able. A Stark decelerator [5, 6, 7] producing cold polar
molecules with tunable and well-deﬁned translational en-
ergy is thus an ideal tool for the study of low (or negative)
barrier chemical reactions. We note other experiments
utilizing photo-association [8, 9, 10] have succeeded in
producing ultra-cold heteronuclear alkali dimers.

In this letter, we present a study of the collision and
reaction properties of OH with H2CO at low tempera-
tures, followed by a detailed description of experiments
required and carried out so far to probe these novel dy-
namics. The calculations suggest for the ﬁrst time that
chemical reactions, as well as collision cross sections, can
be altered orders of magnitude by varying either the
molecular state, or external electric ﬁeld strength. We
speciﬁcally consider the H-abstraction channel in the re-

action of H2CO and OH: H2CO + OH → CHO + H2O.
This reaction not only represents a key component in the
combustion of hydrocarbons, but also plays an important
role in atmospheric chemistry where it is the primary pro-
cess responsible for the removal of the pollutant, H2CO
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Near room temperature the
rate of this reaction is weakly dependent on temperature,
suggesting the barrier to the process (if any) is very low
[13]. Measurements of the thermal activation energy, Ea,
are inconclusive [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18], ranging from
Ea/R = 750 K to -931 K, with the most recent mea-
surement giving a value of -135 K [18]. Here R is the
universal gas constant. The most accurate calculations
[19] predict the energy of the transition state for the ab-
straction to lie between -700 K and +60 K relative to the
reactants.

Experimentally, both OH [6, 7, 20] and H2CO (this
work) molecules have been produced at low temperatures
via Stark deceleration. In the case of spontaneous reac-
tion (Ea < 0) [11, 13, 15, 16], by magnetically trapping
OH in the presence of a tunable bias electric ﬁeld and
“bombarding” the trap with decelerated H2CO packets
the OH - H2CO total scattering and reaction rates can be
mapped as a function of collision energy and applied elec-
tric ﬁeld. Thus Ea can be measured. If Ea > 0, as some
measurements and theory suggest [12, 14, 17, 19], the
collision energy tuning aﬀorded by the Stark decelerator
provides a direct way to measure the energy barrier to
reaction. Unlike thermal kinetics studies, which rely on
ﬁtting the Arrhenius formula to reaction rates, the Stark
decelerator can be used to tune the collision energy above
and below the threshold energy.

As shown in Fig. 1(a), H2CO is a near-symmetric
prolate top molecule, with nearly degenerate rotations
about the b- and c- axes. The dipole moment, µa, along
the a-axis causes these nearly degenerate, opposite parity
states to experience a large Stark shift with an applied
electric ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 1(b-d). Here, the states

are labeled by their zero-ﬁeld identity in the |Jτ mJ >
basis, where τ = Ka − Kc (Ki is the projection of J
along the ith axis) [21]. Of particular interest to this
work is the |111 > state (Fig. 1(c)), which is the upper
component of the lowest J level of ortho-formaldehyde
and is hence well populated in our supersonic expansion.
This state experiences a large Stark shift (1.32 cm−1 at
125 kV/cm), making it excellent for Stark deceleration.
There are other states accessible via, for example, stim-
ulated Raman adiabatic passage that oﬀer an improved
Stark deceleration eﬃciency (|222 >) or a good candidate
for implementing an AC Stark trap (|000 >) [22].

OH-H2CO Theory. The Hamiltonian, H, used in

the scattering calculations takes the following form:

H = T + HOH + HH2CO + HStark + Hdd + Hsr + Hchem.
(1)
Here T is the kinetic energy, HOH and HH2CO are the
Hamiltonians of the separated molecules, and HStark de-
scribes the action of the electric ﬁeld on the individual
molecules. Hdd represents the long-range dipole-dipole
interaction between the molecules, which depends on the
orientations of the molecules relative to the ﬁeld axis, as
well as the distance R between them. This will be ex-
pressed in a basis of molecular eigenstates (including the
eﬀect of the ﬁeld), as was done in Ref. [4]. In addition, to
prevent the dipole-dipole interaction from overwhelming
the short-range interaction, we replace its 1/R3 varia-
tion with 1/(R3 + cdd) for an appropriate constant cdd
[23]. The chemical reaction dynamics are modeled in a
schematic way by the terms Hsr and Hchem. The goal of
Hsr is to mimic an anisotropic interaction with a barrier,
not necessarily to characterize the OH-H2CO system.
This approximation is justiﬁed for the low reaction bar-
rier where the dipole-dipole interaction dominates over
internal molecular dynamics. Thus, we construct a po-

sion cross sections as a function of external electric ﬁeld at 1
mK. (b) Chemical reaction cross sections from the schematic

tential as an expansion into Legendre functions,

Hsr = Vo(R) − 2V2(R)C20(θ, φ).

(2)

Here (θ, φ) represent the spherical angles of the relative
coordinate between the molecules, referred to the electric
ﬁeld axis, and C20 is a reduced spherical harmonic [24].
The isotropic part of this potential carries the barrier at
a radius R ≈ Rb ,

Vo(R) =

C12
R12 −

R6 + DB exp(

).

(3)

The height of the barrier depending on DB is fully ad-
justable with wb characterizing the range. In the follow-
ing, we set the barrier height equal to the threshold en-
ergy of the incoming molecule. The radial dependence of
V2 is chosen to have a magnitude comparable to Vo, but
to change sign as R crosses Rb. Thus the polar molecules
attract in a head-to-tail conﬁguration for R > Rb, but
attract in a tail-to-tail conﬁguration upon crossing the
barrier. Finally, chemical reactivity (Hchem) is modeled
by coupling to a purely repulsive artiﬁcial channel. The
coupling to this channel is represented by a decaying ex-
ponential in R, which is of negligible size for R > Rb. To
complete a chemical reaction, the molecules must cross
over the barrier, reverse their relative orientation, and
ﬁnd the artiﬁcial channel.

Collision cross sections for OH-H2CO scattering in this
model are shown in Fig. 2(a). Here both molecules
are assumed to be in spin-stretched, weak-ﬁeld-seeking
states:
|F mF , parity >= |22, f > for OH, and |111 >
for H2CO. The cross section for elastic (spin-changing)
collisions is shown as a solid (dashed) line. The cross sec-
tions are large and comparable, and exhibit strong mod-
ulations as a function of an applied electric ﬁeld. This
has been explained for OH-OH scattering on the basis of
purely long-range scattering by the dipole-dipole interac-
tion [4]. Thus, these results are robust and independent
of the detailed form of the short-range interaction.

The sensitive dependence of cold molecules on inter-
nal state and electric ﬁeld engenders new prospects for
probing and controlling the chemical reaction itself. To

illustrate this, we show in Fig. 2(b) the chemical re-
action cross section versus electric ﬁeld. The collision
energy is assumed to be 1 mK. (Note that, because the
reaction mechanism is schematic in our model we report
only relative values for the cross sections.) The solid line
is for collisions in which both OH and H2CO molecules
are in their strong-ﬁeld-seeking states. At this energy
the ﬁeld has a profound inﬂuence on the reaction cross
section, mostly by accessing a very large number of reso-
nant states. Considering that each resonant state spans a
diﬀerent region of conﬁguration space, mapping out res-
onances such as these would serve as an extremely sensi-
tive probe to transition states. The dashed trace in Fig.
2(b) shows the reaction rate for weak-ﬁeld-seeking states
of the reactants. In addition to probing many resonances,
this cross section rises by nearly four orders of magnitude
as the ﬁeld increases. This rise is also a direct conse-
quence of the dipole-dipole interaction. In Refs. [4, 25] it
was shown that for polar molecules in weak-ﬁeld-seeking
states, the dipole-dipole interaction can “shield” these
molecules from getting close enough together to react
chemically. Thus the cross section is strongly suppressed
relative to that for strong-ﬁeld-seekers. However, as the
ﬁeld is increased, the inner turning point of the relevant
potential curve moves to smaller R, making the shielding
less eﬀective, and hence, the reaction more likely.

While the above discussion is relevant for future studies
in a low temperature trap environment, another impor-
tant capability for current experiments is the direct con-
trol of the H-abstraction reaction barrier height through
the application of an external electric ﬁeld. The basic
[14],
H-abstraction reaction mechanism, following Ref.
is shown in Fig. 3. We note that Ref.
[26] presents a
slightly diﬀerent H-abstraction conﬁguration, but with
the same end-to-end dipole coupling scheme. During the
H-abstraction process, the energy required to rotate one
dipole moment (OH) versus the other (H2CO) enables
our proposed control of reaction dynamics using an ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld. Hence, the two abstraction conﬁgu-
rations present no diﬀerence other than the magnitude of
the shift we can create in the reaction barrier. The impor-
tant characteristic to note is that the hydrogen-bonded
complex (HBC) in the second panel (Fig. 3) forms along
an attractive direction of the two electric dipoles, but
in the transition state (TS) the OH dipole has essentially
ﬂipped its orientation relative to the H2CO dipole. While
an external electric ﬁeld, which orients the molecules
would allow (and perhaps even encourage) the forma-
tion of the HBC; it would add an energy barrier to the
formation of the TS, and thus the H-abstraction chan-
nel through the OH dipole-ﬁeld interaction. Based on
the bond geometries shown in Ref. [14], the addition to
the energy barrier in going from the HBC to the TS is
−→
≈ 1.8µOH|
E |, where µOH is the expectation value of the
dipole for the OH molecule. For a high, yet attainable,
electric ﬁeld of 250 kV/cm, the additional barrier energy

abstraction channel following Ref [14].

would be 10 K. Thus, assuming a reaction barrier at a
H2CO collision speed of 223 m/s (60 K [19]) the applied
electric ﬁeld would shift the required collision velocity to
234 m/s, well within the Stark decelerator resolution.

Experiment. The decelerator used for H2CO is sim-
ilar to the apparatus in our previously described OH ex-
periments [6, 7, 27]. Molecules in a skimmed, pulsed su-
personic beam are focused by an electrostatic hexapole
ﬁeld to provide transverse coupling into the Stark decel-
erator. The Stark decelerator is constructed of 143 slow-
ing stages spaced 5.461 mm apart with each stage com-
prised of two cylindrical electrodes of diameter 3.175 mm
separated axially by 5.175 mm and oppositely biased at
high voltage (± 12.5 kV). Successive stages are oriented
at 90o to each other to provide transverse guiding of the
molecular beam. The geometry of the slowing stages pro-
vides an electric ﬁeld maximum between the electrodes
with the ﬁeld decreasing away from the electrode cen-
ter. Switching the electric ﬁeld when the molecules are
directly between two adjacent stages (no net decelera-
tion) is denoted by a synchronous phase angle of φo = 0o
(often referred to as bunching), while switching the elec-
tric ﬁeld when the molecules are between the electrodes
(maximum deceleration) is denoted by φo = 90o.

The H2CO molecules are produced from the cracking
of the formaldehyde polymer to produce the monomer,
which is passed through a double u-tube apparatus [28].
Xenon at 2 bar pressure is ﬂowed over the collected
H2CO, held at 196 K where H2CO has ∼2.7 kPa (20
Torr) vapor pressure. This Xe/H2CO mixture is ex-
panded through a solenoid type supersonic valve produc-
ing a beam with a mean speed of 350 m/s with approxi-
mately a 10% velocity spread.

H2CO is detected using laser-induced ﬂuorescence.
The molecules are excited from the |111 > ground state
by photons at 353 nm generated from a frequency-
doubled, pulsed-dye laser pumped by Nd:YAG laser to
e
A1A2 electronically excited state with one quan-
the
tum in the ν4 out-of-plane bending vibrational mode.

FIG. 4: Stark deceleration of H2CO molecules, showing (a)
bunching (φo = 0o) and Stark deceleration at φo = 30o (oﬀset
down for clarity).
(b) Stark decelerated packets of H2CO
molecules at the output of the decelerator.

Approximately 40% of the excited H2CO decays non-
radiatively [29], while the remaining molecules emit dis-
tributed ﬂuorescence from 353 nm to 610 nm [30].

Shown in Fig. 4 are time-of-ﬂight (ToF) measurements
taken at the exit of the decelerator, which is ∼0.9 m
down-stream from the valve.
In these ﬁgures the time
axis is relative to the beginning of deceleration. In Fig.
4(a) where the decelerator is operated at φo = 0o, a large
peak in the ToF curve denotes the arrival (marked by an
arrow) of the phase stable packet whose density is ∼106
cm−3 and contains a few million molecules. It is impor-
tant to note that even though the speed of this packet
is 340 m/s, 10 m/s lower than the pulse mean speed, no
deceleration has occurred. Instead the molecules in the
pulse whose speed was in the range from 340 m/s ± 25
m/s were loaded into the packet as detailed in our earlier
work [27]. Also shown in Fig. 4(a), but oﬀset for clarity
is the ToF curve for deceleration at φo = 30o. Here the
arrow denotes the arrival of a slowed H2CO packet with
a mean velocity of 204 m/s. Displayed in Fig. 4(b) are
ToF curves for the slowed molecular packets as a function
of φo. The minimum speed shown is 26 m/s for φo = 50o,
resulting in a temperature of ∼100 mK.

To observe the OH-H2CO collision and reaction dy-
namics requires monitoring both the OH population and
the production of the formyl radical (CHO). We have
developed sensitive ﬂuorescence imaging techniques for
OH [7], and because CHO has a low ionization poten-
tial (8.1 eV), high signal-to-noise ratio photo-ionization
detection of the reaction can be implemented. Neverthe-
less, given the current available densities of the reactants
the observation of the dynamics proposed here will be
daunting. However, further improvements such as multi-
ple trap loading and secondary cooling of the molecular
samples should make these observations possible.

In summary, we have detailed new methods to study
interspecies molecular collision and reaction dynamics,
and have shown how control of these processes may be
achieved. We have also demonstrated preparation of both
cold polar molecules required for these studies. Exper-
iments are currently poised to begin exploring the rich

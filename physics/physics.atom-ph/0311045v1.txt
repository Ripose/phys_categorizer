We subject a falling cloud of cold cesium atoms to periodic kicks from a sinusoidal potential created by a
vertical standing wave of oﬀ-resonant laser light. Controllably accelerating the potential to vary the eﬀective
gravity experienced by the atoms, we show quantum accelerator mode dynamics to be highly sensitive to the
gravitational acceleration when this is close to speciﬁc, resonant values. The high sensitivity of the quantum
dynamics to variations in a control parameter is reminiscent of that associated with classical chaos.

The identiﬁcation and observation of signatures of chaos in
quantum dynamics is the goal of considerable current eﬀort.
Much of this work centers on the theoretical deﬁnition and
characterization of certain quantities, such as the Loschmidt
echo [1] and ﬁdelity [2], or energy spectra [3], which could
be observed experimentally but require some interpretation
to highlight the way in which their nature betokens stabil-
ity or chaos. An attractive complement to these investiga-
tions would be the observation of diﬀerent motional regimes,
to which one could immediately attribute a chaotic or stable
character. This is more in sympathy with the techniques and
philosophy used to identify classical chaos.

A promising solution to the apparent dichotomy between
the quantum and classical dynamics of chaotic systems is that
sensitivity to small variations in a system’s Hamiltonian be
used as a deﬁnition of quantum instability [1, 2, 4].
It has
previously been envisaged that this sensitivity be probed by
interferometric techniques [5, 6], but dynamical observations
could also permit such investigation. In this Letter we report
the observation of extreme sensitivity to small variations in
a control parameter, the eﬀective value of gravity, of the δ-
kicked accelerator [7]. This system, which is an extension of
the paradigmatic δ-kicked rotor [8], gives rise to the recently
observed quantum accelerator modes [6, 7, 9, 10, 11]. These
prompted novel theoretical analyses by Fishman, Guarneri
and Rebuzzini (FGR) of quantum chaotic dynamics in near-
resonant regimes [12]. The interpretation of the observations
reported in this letter stems from this novel theoretical un-
derstanding. The sensitivity in the dynamics we observe also
promises the capability of precise measurement of gravity.

The Hamiltonian of the δ-kicked accelerator, realized using
a magneto-optic trap (MOT) of laser-cooled atoms that are
then released and subjected to pulses from a standing wave of
oﬀ-resonant light, is

ˆH =

+ mgˆz − ~φd[1 + cos(Gˆz)]

δ(t − nT ),

(1)

ˆp2

Xn=−∞

where ˆz is the position, ˆp the momentum, m the particle mass,
t the time, T the pulse period, ~φd quantiﬁes the strength of the
kicking potential, G = 2π/λspat, and λspat is the spatial period
of the standing wave applied to the atoms. The quantity g is
normally the gravitational acceleration. However, by ‘acceler-
ating’ the standing wave, it is possible to eﬀectively modify g.

We have previously used this technique to counteract gravity
and regain kicked rotor dynamics [7, 13].

Transforming to dimensionless position and momentum
variables χ = Gz and ρ = GT p/m, one deduces δ-kicked
accelerator dynamics to be characterized by the stochasticity
parameter κ = ~φdGT/m, a rescaled gravitational acceleration
γ = gGT 2, and an eﬀective Planck constant k = ~G2T/m,
deﬁned through k = −i[ ˆχ, ˆρ]. The very successful FGR pseu-
doclassical model [12] relates quantum accelerator modes to
the stable periodic orbits of the map for a (ﬁctitious) classical
point particle:

˜ρn+1 = ˜ρn − ˜k sin(χn) − sgn(ǫ)γ,
χn+1 = χn + sgn(ǫ) ˜ρn+1,

(2a)
(2b)

where ˜ρ = ρǫ/k, χ is now an angle variable deﬁned on (−π, π]
(the phase space is also 2π-periodic in ˜ρ), ˜k = |ǫ|φd, and ǫ is
a smallness parameter quantifying the proximity of the sys-
tem’s driving period to that yielding a low-order quantum res-
onance in the δ-kicked rotor (for which k = 2πℓ, where ℓ is
an integer). Speciﬁcally, ǫ = (k − 2πℓ), and the validity of
this classical mapping description relies on the closeness of k
to integer multiples of 2π. Experimentally this translates to
the closeness of T to integer multiples of the half-Talbot time
T1/2 = 2πm/~G2, so that ǫ = 2π(T/T1/2 − ℓ).

The stable periodic orbits yielded by Eq. (2) (and hence
quantum accelerator modes) are classiﬁed by their order p and
jumping index j, which is the number of momentum units,
in terms of the size of the phase-space cell, traversed after p
iterations. The sign of j is determined by whether this occurs
in the positive or negative momentum direction. A necessary
condition for the existence of a periodic orbit is [12]:

Note that φd and γ/k2 = gm2/~2G3 are independent of T .
Experimentally, we scan through T , making Eq. (4) a con-

venient form to use. It is clear that as ǫ → 0, the accelera-
tor modes that occur must be characterized by j and p such
that j/p → −sgn(ǫ)2πℓ2γ/k2. As 2πℓ2γ/k2 is in general an
irrational value, one usually observes a succession of increas-
ingly high-order accelerator modes as T approaches integer
multiples of T1/2 [9].

If, however, we tune the eﬀective gravitational accelera-
tion so that 2πℓ2γ/k2 = r/s, where r and s are integers, then
j/p + sgn(ǫ)2πℓ2γ/k2 is exactly zero for j/p = −sgn(ǫ)r/s.
Once the (p, j) accelerator mode satisfying this condition ap-
pears, shifting T closer to ℓT1/2 will not produce any higher-
order accelerator modes, making for a substantially simpler
accelerator mode spectrum. In Fig. 1 we plot Poincar´e sec-
tions produced by Eq. (2) for γ = k2/2π = (2π + ǫ)2/2π
(i.e., r/s = 1) and ˜k = |ǫ|φd equal to the approximate ex-
perimental mean value of |ǫ|0.8π [7]. The islands around the
(p, j) = (1, ±1) periodic orbits remain large over a wide range
of ǫ, and in Fig. 2(a) we observe the corresponding quantum
accelerator modes to be similarly robust.

In a frame accelerating with (eﬀective) gravity, the momen-
tum, in grating recoils ~G [10], after N kicks for an initial
condition near a (p, j) stable periodic orbit is [12]

where q0 is the initial momentum. This equation is exact for

possible to consider simultaneously the momentum of the or-
bits speciﬁed by j/p = r/s (for negative ǫ) and j/p = −r/s
(for positive ǫ), as a single function of N and ǫ. As we are in-
terested in situations where γ/k2 approaches special resonant
values, we let 2πℓ2γ/k2 = r/s + wℓ2 and ﬁnd [14]

Scanning through ǫ (i.e., varying the pulse period T from just
below to just above an integer multiple of T1/2), one does not
commonly observe two accelerator modes, corresponding to
stable periodic orbits in Eq. (2), of the same p and magnitude
of j (with positive sign for negative ǫ, and negative sign for
positive ǫ) [9, 15]. In the gravity-resonant cases we consider,
however, when 2πℓ2γ/k2 is close to r/s, we always observe
ﬁrst an r/s and then a −r/s accelerator mode as we scan ǫ
from negative to positive values. This makes Eq. (6) very con-
venient, and we see that for a given N, q is a linear function
of ǫ whenever w = 0. Any nonzero value of w changes this
to a hyperbolic function of ǫ, where the arms of the hyperbola
point in opposite directions for oppositely signed w. The de-
viation from straight line behaviour in a mode accelerated to a
given momentum will tend to be larger for a gravity-resonant
mode corresponding to a smaller value of j/p = r/s. This is
because the acceleration of the mode is proportional to j/p, but
the deviation is proportional to N. We consider only acceler-
ator modes where j = r = 1, so high-order modes exhibit, for
a given momentum transfer, greater sensitivity to variations in
the eﬀective gravity than low-order modes.

FIG. 1: Phase space plots produced by Eq. (2), when γ/k2 = 1/2π ⇒
γ = (2π+ǫ)2/2π, and ˜k = |ǫ|0.8π for (a) ǫ = −1.57, (b) ǫ = −0.88, (c)
ǫ = −0.02, (d) ǫ = 0.03, (e) ǫ = 0.6, and (f) ǫ = 1.35. Experimentally
this corresponds to T = 50 µs, 57.4 µs, 66.5 µs, 67 µs, 73 µs, and
81 µs, respectively. For (a), (b), and (c) the stable island corresponds
to a (p, j) = (1, 1) accelerator mode, and for (d), (e), and (f) to a
(p, j) = (1, −1) accelerator mode. In (a) and (f) (where |ǫ| is large)
there are unpopulated areas of phase space around coexisting stable
periodic orbits, not considered in this Letter.

In our realization of the quantum δ-kicked accelerator,
about 107 cesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a MOT to
a temperature of 5µK, yielding a Gaussian momentum dis-
tribution with FWHM 6~G. The atoms are then released and
exposed to a sequence of equally spaced pulses from a stand-
ing wave of higher intensity light 15 GHz red-detuned from
the 62S 1/2 → 62P1/2, (F = 4 → F′ = 3) D1 transition. Hence
the spatial period of the standing wave is λspat = 447 nm and
T1/2 = 66.7µs. The peak intensity in the standing wave is
≃ 5 × 104 mW/cm2, and the pulse duration is tp = 500 ns.
This is suﬃciently short that the atoms are in the Raman-Nath
regime and hence each application of the potential is a good
approximation to a δ-function kick. The potential depth is
quantiﬁed by φd = Ω2tp/8δL, where Ω is the Rabi frequency,
and δL the detuning from the D1 transition. For further details
see Refs. [7, 10]

r/s = 1/1 (after 15 kicks), (b) r/s = 1/2 (30 kicks), (c) r/s = 1/3 (45 kicks), and (d) r/s = 1/4 (60 kicks), as T is varied in the vicinity of
the half Talbot time T1/2 = 66.7 µs, from 60.5 µs to 74.5 µs in steps of 0.128 µs. In each case the accelerator mode corresponds to j/p = r/s;
subplot (i) corresponds to w ≃ −8.5 × 10−4 (deviation from resonant value of gravity ∼ −8.6 × 10−2 ms−2), subplot (ii) to w ≃ 0, and subplot
(iii) to w ≃ 8.5 × 10−4 (deviation from resonant value of gravity ∼ 8.6 × 10−2 ms−2). The overlaid lines indicate the accelerator mode momenta
predicted by Eq. (6), and are labelled (p, j). Population arbitrarily normalized to maximum value = 1, and momentum deﬁned in a frame falling
with the eﬀective gravity. Note the signiﬁcantly greater population at high momentum (up to 50~G) near T1/2 in (d.i) and (d.iii), compared to
(a.i) and (a.iii).

During the pulse sequence, a voltage-controlled crystal
phase modulator is used to stroboscopically accelerate the
standing wave proﬁle at a rate which may be the same or dif-
ferent from that of the freely-falling atoms. The atoms can
therefore eﬀectively experience a zero or non-standard, and
controllable, value of gravity. After the pulsing sequence,
the atoms fall through a sheet of laser light resonant with the
62S 1/2 → 62P3/2, (F = 4 → F′′ = 5) D2 transition. This is
located 0.5 m below the MOT, and by monitoring the absorp-
tion the atoms’ momentum distribution is then measured by a
time-of-ﬂight method with a resolution of ~G.

In Fig. 2 we show the measured momentum distributions
for experiments in which the value of T was scanned around
the half-Talbot time T1/2 (ℓ = 1) from 60.5µs to 74.5µs us-
ing diﬀerent values of γ/k2. The value of 2πγ/k2 was varied
in the vicinity of (a) 2πγ/k2 = r/s = 1/1, (b) r/s = 1/2,
(c) r/s = 1/3, and (d) r/s = 1/4. To keep the total ideal
(w = 0) momentum transfer the same in each case, the num-
ber of kicks applied was 15, 30, 45 and 60, respectively, ﬁx-
ing Nr/s. For each of Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) the data
displayed are: in subplot (ii), from experiments in which the
condition 2πγ/k2 = r/s is fulﬁlled as exactly as experimen-

tally feasible, yielding linear variation of the accelerator mode
momentum as a function of T ; and in subplots (i) and (iii), for
equal positive and negative deviations, respectively, from this
near-ideal situation, yielding hyperbolic variation of the ac-
celerator mode momentum.

For each of Figs. 2(a.ii), 2(b.ii), 2(c.ii), and 2(d.ii), the value
of the quantum accelerator mode momentum predicted by Eq.
(6), shown as an overlaid line, is identical. The expected linear
dependence on T appears to be well conﬁrmed by the experi-
mental data, although the separation of the quantum accelera-
tor modes from the main cloud, centered at momentum zero,
is clearer for smaller r = j (there is less momentum diﬀu-
sion due to the smaller number of kicks). The eﬀect of imper-
fectly resonant gravity, shown in subplots (i) and (iii) of each
of Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d), is much more dramatic for
larger r = j, for which more kicks are applied. In Fig. 2(a),
subplots (i) and (iii) are barely distinguishable from subplot
(ii), whereas in Fig. 2(d), the momentum distributions in sub-
plots (i) and (iii) are highly asymmetric when compared with
subplot (ii), with, close to T1/2, noticeable population at up
to 50~G. The asymmetry clearly inverts as one changes from
below [subplot (i)] to above [subplot (iii)] the resonant value
of gravity. We therefore observe a clear qualitative change in
the quantum accelerator mode dynamics that is highly sensi-
tive to a control parameter. The displayed predictions of Eq.
(6) show that deviations from linear behavior only occur when
very close to T1/2 in Figs. 2(a.i) and 2(a.iii), but are much more
signiﬁcant in Figs. 2(d.i) and 2(d.iii). This is due to the larger
number of kicks necessary for large r = j to achieve the same
ideal accelerator mode momentum.

The procedure of determining the ‘standing wave accelera-
tion’ at which straight-line behavior of a given (p, j) accelera-
tor mode’s momentum is observed as a function of T could in
principle be used as a sensitive measure of the local gravita-
tional acceleration. This would be determined by noting when
the total acceleration (sinusoidal potential plus gravitational)
hits particular known resonant values, and then subtracting the
known acceleration of the sinusoidal potential. In our particu-
lar setup, where the sinusoidal potential is ‘accelerated’ by us-
ing a crystal phase modulator to phase-shift the retroreﬂected
laser beam [7, 10], the value of the phase shift corresponding
to a particular applied voltage is diﬃcult to calibrate more pre-
cisely than ∼ 1 %. Consequently, our apparatus is not optimal
for taking advantage of the dynamics’ sensitivity to determine
gravity; accurate prediction of the accelerator mode momenta
for imperfectly resonant values of the eﬀective gravity, as dis-
played in Fig. 2, is also hampered. This could be improved
by a conﬁguration in which a moving sinusoidal potential is
formed by two counterpropagating beams with a controllable
frequency diﬀerence [16]. The acceleration of the sinusoidal
potential could be set with very high precision, yielding a cor-

4

responding increase in the precision of the local gravity mea-
surement.

In conclusion, we have observed qualitative changes in the
motional quantum dynamics of cold cesium atoms which are
highly sensitive to the precise value of an externally adjustable
parameter, the eﬀective gravity. This is related to propos-
als that consider slightly diﬀering Hamiltonians to study the
Loschmidt echo or ﬁdelity, and demonstrates an attractive link
to the concepts of highly sensitive dynamics in classically
chaotic systems. Furthermore, we have described a feasible
experimental scheme taking advantage of this sensitivity to
determine the local gravitational acceleration.

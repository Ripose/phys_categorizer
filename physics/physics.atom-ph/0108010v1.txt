I. INTRODUCTION

A very intriguing feature of above-threshold ionization
or high-order harmonic generation concerns the depen-
dence of these phenomena on the intensity of the driv-
ing ﬁeld. The photo-electron or high-order harmonic
peaks, as functions of the driving-ﬁeld intensity, present
resonance-like enhancements, such that a variation of a
few percent in the external-ﬁeld strength may drive up
the spectral intensity by an order of magnitude. These
enhancements have been observed experimentally by sev-
eral groups for above-threshold ionization (ATI) [1,2],
and, recently, for high-order harmonic generation (HHG)
[3]. A concomitant eﬀect in ATI is a variation of the con-
trast of the spectrum [4].

Early numerical observations that enhancements of
ATI go hand in hand with enhancements of HHG were re-
ported in Ref. [5]. The existence of enhancements for both
phenomena is not surprising, and is related to their com-
mon physical origin. Indeed, HHG and ATI present very
similar spectral features, which are explained by similar
physical pictures. These features are a wide energy range
with approximately equally strong harmonics or photo-
electron peaks, known as “the plateau”, followed by a
sharp decrease in the harmonic or photo-electron signal,
known as “the cutoﬀ”. HHG is described by the so-
called “three-step model”, in which an electron is ionized
through tunneling or multiphoton ionization, is acceler-

ated by the ﬁeld and driven back to its parent ion, where
it recombines to the ground state, emitting its energy as
one harmonic photon [6,7]. A similar process is respon-
sible for the plateau in above-threshold ionization, with
the main diﬀerence that, instead of recombining with the
parent ion, the electron is elastically rescattered oﬀ it [8].
In either case, the precise shape of the atomic potential
is not very important, and it can be approximated, for
instance, by a zero-range potential. This approximation
describes very well the spectral features near the high-
energy end of the plateau.

The resonance-like enhancements, however, primarily
occur in the ﬁrst half of the plateau, for which both the
external driving ﬁeld and the atomic potential are ex-
pected to inﬂuence the harmonic or photo-electron emis-
sion [9]. In fact, very diﬀerent arguments have been put
forward to explain these enhancements. Several studies
attribute these features to Rydberg states that, for an
appropriate ponderomotive upshift, become multiphoton
resonant with the ground state. Namely, a free electron
in a laser ﬁeld acquires a ﬁeld-dependent energy shift
by the ponderomotive potential Up = e2
t /2m,
where A(t) is the vector potential of the laser ﬁeld and
h...it denotes the average over a ﬁeld cycle. Highly ex-
cited Rydberg states tend to undergo about the same
shift as free electrons [10]. The result of such a multi-
photon resonance is either an increase in ionization, or
the electronic wave packet is trapped near its parent ion
for relatively long times, originating resonance-like struc-
tures in the spectra [11]. The mechanism is quite similar
to the Freeman resonances [12], which dominate the low-
energy ATI spectrum where rescattering plays no role.
According to this physical picture, the presence of high-
lying Rydberg states is essential for the existence of the
enhancements.

An – at least at ﬁrst glance – completely diﬀerent view
relates these enhancements to channel closings that, by
the same ponderomotive-upshift mechanism, may move
into multiphoton resonance with the ground state.
If,
due to this shift, N photons are no longer suﬃcient for
the electron to reach the continuum, one refers to the
N -photon channel as having closed. At an intensity cor-
responding to a channel closing, the electron is released
in the continuum with a vanishing drift momentum. In
consequence, in the course of its oscillatory motion in
the laser ﬁeld, it will return many times to its parent ion
and upon each revisit have the opportunity to rescat-
ter. Quantum mechanically, the corresponding probabil-
ity amplitudes interfere, and a constructive interference

manifests itself as an enhancement [2]. Such an eﬀect
does not require the existence of excited states or Ryd-
berg states so that the atom can be modeled by a binding
potential of zero range, which neither supports excited
bound states nor resonances in the continuum [2,13,14].
The zero-range potential aﬀords the concept of “quan-
tum orbits” which allows for an almost analytical ap-
proach to intense-laser–atom phenomena [15]. However,
one has to keep in mind that real atoms do have long-
range-potential tails, so that channel closings are diﬀuse
owing to the presence of the Rydberg series. In addition,
they support various bound states, whose inﬂuence on
the enhancements is not entirely clear.

In this paper, we perform a systematic study of the
inﬂuence of both the laser ﬁeld and the atomic potential
on these enhancements, for high-order harmonic genera-
tion, by means of simpliﬁed atomic models. We address
the question of which one of the existing physical inter-
pretations is ultimately correct or whether both pictures
are complementary aspects of a more complete descrip-
tion. In particular, we investigate the importance of the
highly excited states in the process, and whether or not
they are crucial for the feature in question.

for a one-dimensional model atom [16] initially in the
ground state of a binding potential V (x) and subject to
a laser pulse with the ﬁeld E(t) = −dA(t)/dt. Atomic
units are used throughout. We consider a monochromatic
laser ﬁeld

E(t) = E0 sin ωt,

and the harmonic spectra are calculated from the dipole
acceleration ¨x = hψ(t)| − dV (x)/dx + E(t) |ψ(t)i [17]. We
take the smoothly truncated soft-core potential

so that V (x) = 0 for |x| > L. We choose a0 of the order
of a few atomic units, and L of the order of the electron
excursion amplitude, so that L = rα = rE0/ω2 with the
parameter r of order unity. Setting f (x) = 1 in (3) gives

the untruncated soft-core potential. By an appropriate
choice of the parameters L and a0, it is possible to alter
the highly excited bound states leaving the ground state
and the low excited states practically unaﬀected.

Let us assume that an atom, initially in the ground
state with energy ε0, is ionized by N photons of frequency
ω, such that the electron reaches the continuum with the
lowest energy possible, that is, with a drift momentum
(outside the range of the binding potential) of zero. The
energy of the N photons must account for the binding
energy and the kinetic energy of the oscillatory motion
(the ponderomotive energy Up), so that

|ε0| + Up = N ω.

(5)

For intensities slightly larger than speciﬁed by the condi-
tion (5), at least N + 1 photons will be necessary for ion-
ization, such that Eq. (5) deﬁnes the N -photon channel-
closing intensity. The intensities that solve the channel-
closing condition (5) form a comb whose teeth as a func-
tion of η = Up/ω are separated by unity. If there is an
excited bound state with the (ﬁeld-free) energy εn and
if this state undergoes the same ponderomotive upshift
as the continuum [10], then multiphoton resonance with
the ground state occurs for intensities such that Eq. (5)
is satisﬁed with ε0 replaced by ε0 − εn,

|ε0 − εn| + Up = N ω.

(6)

For a long-range potential [such as, in one dimension,
our untruncated potential (3)] the true continuum is pre-
ceded by the Rydberg series so that one may question
the signiﬁcance of the channel-closing condition (5) for
any physical phenomenon. For a ﬁnite-range potential
[such as the truncated potential (3)] the Rydberg series
is replaced by a ﬁnite sequence of bound states whose
number decreases with decreasing L.

Below, we will seek to answer the following questions:
Is the very existence of an enhancement contingent on
the shape of the binding potential? If an enhancement
exists, does it occur at a channel-closing intensity (5) for
some N , or is related to a multiphoton resonance (6) with
a certain excited state |ni, or is it unrelated to either?
For a truncated potential, do enhancements occur both
at the channel-closing intensities and at intensities where
an excited state becomes multiphoton resonant? To what
extent does the harmonic spectrum depend on the shape
of the potential?

For all examples presented in this paper, we choose
β = 2.1 and σ = 0.2 in the soft-core potential (3). In
this case, the ﬁeld-free energies of the ground state and
the ﬁrst four excited states are listed in Table I for the
untruncated potential as well as for various truncations.
The Table shows that the ground-state energy is virtu-
ally unaltered by the truncations we consider while the
excited states are more and more aﬀected. For the un-
truncated potential, the ﬁrst excited states are followed
by the Rydberg series. For all truncations considered,
the states listed are the only ones that survived. By and

a.u., and several values of η = Up/ω, for the untruncated (a)
and truncated (b) soft-core potential, with L ≃ 31.78 a.u.
and a0 = 3 a.u. The parameter L was chosen as twice as the
electron excursion amplitude α for η = 4.8. The harmonic
intensities are connected by lines to guide the eye. The thick
lines correspond to the ﬁeld intensity for which the enhance-
ment is maximal.

Figure 1 displays two harmonic spectra, computed for
the untruncated (a) and a truncated (b) soft-core poten-
tial. Both spectra are very similar, with pronounced en-
hancements near the 13th harmonic. For the untruncated
and truncated cases, we observe maximal enhancements
at η = 4.3 and η = 4.1, respectively. These values do
not coincide with the channel-closing intensity η = 4.04
(modulo any integer) predicted by Eq. (5). This shows
a clear inﬂuence of the binding potential on the abso-
lute intensity for which these features occur. However,
comparing parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 we notice a very
remarkable fact: the spectra of the untruncated (a) and
the truncated (b) potential are almost identical provided
we compare a spectrum at the intensity η for the former
with a spectrum at the intensity η − 0.2 for the latter.
This holds for all intensities considered. Table I shows
that the truncated potential no longer supports the Ry-
dberg series and its excited state |3i is very close to the
continuum. We conclude that the Rydberg series has
no visible impact on the shape of the harmonic spec-
trum. Checking again Table I we further conclude that
the intensities where the enhancements are maximal are
compatible with Eq. (6) with n = 3.

Further support for these conclusions comes from Fig.
2, where the yield of the 13th harmonic is plotted as a
function of the scaled intensity η = Up/ω.
In this ﬁg-
ure, we also investigate the eﬀect of the truncation in
more detail, for a wider range of intensities and trun-
cating parameters. The most striking feature is that the
main eﬀect of the various truncations is a rigid horizontal
shift of the yield-versus-intensity curve. Remarkably, this
statement includes the pronounced dips which are due to
quantum interference between diﬀerent quantum orbits
[7,15]. While this may be plausible for the large values of
the truncation parameter (L = 2α) where the truncation
mostly aﬀects the potential outside of the classical elec-
tronic excursion, it is quite surprising for the small value
L = 0.3α. A similar shift pattern is observed for all low
plateau harmonics (not shown).

large, for the parameter range used, the truncation elimi-
nates the Rydberg series, changes the energy of the third
excited state, and leaves the more deeply bound states
unchanged. The shape of the eﬀective potential barrier
Veﬀ = V (x)−xE(t) also remains very similar for all cases.

III. RESULTS

As a ﬁrst step, we investigate a harmonic spectrum
as a function of the laser intensity with regard to the
existence of enhancements for particular intensities. The
frequency of the laser ﬁeld is taken as ω = 0.07600 a.u.,
such that Eq. (5) predicts channel-closing intensities for
near-integer values of η = Up/ω. The other intensities
that correspond to resonances with excited states are also
listed in Table I. For the frequency and the intensity
range considered in this paper, the Keldysh parameter
|ε0|/2Up lies within the interval 1.66 < γ < 0.86,
γ =
which is mostly within the multiphoton regime.

onance in the spectrum while a multiphoton resonance
with other excited states does not? We can answer this
question by inspecting the wave functions hx|ni of the ex-
cited states. Please, notice that our calculations are still
within the multiphoton regime of ionization. In this case,
one expects that multiphoton resonance with an excited
bound state is particularly relevant if the wave function
of the latter is concentrated near the turning points of
the wiggling motion of a classical electron with a drift
momentum of zero, i.e., when |hx|ni|2 has its maxima
near |x| ≈ α = E0/ω2. Figure 3 shows that indeed this
is well satisﬁed by the state |3i.

of the parameter L, L = 31.78 a.u. and L = 4.77 a.u.,
correspond to 2α(η = 4.8) and 0.3α(η = 4.8), respectively.
The binding energies for the various truncated potentials are
given in table I. Part (b): Enlargement of part (a), for
3.4 < η < 5.4. The values of this parameter, for which the
enhancements are maximal, are marked by arrows.

Next, we investigate the quantitative amount of the
afore-mentioned shift. Comparison with Table I shows
that all of the enhancement peaks present in Fig. 2 are
compatible with the intensities predicted by Eq. (6) for
n = 3. As long as the state |3i exists as a bound state,
we conclude that the enhancement is due to a multipho-
ton resonance with this state, upshifted by the whole
amount of the ponderomotive energy. However, the en-
hancement still exists (near integer η), though quanti-
tatively smaller, in the case where the truncation (for
L = 0.3α) has eliminated the third excited state. Here
we have encountered a case of a pure channel-closing en-
hancement which is due to a multiphoton resonance with
the ponderomotively upshifted continuum threshold.

Why does a multiphoton resonance with the third ex-

η/ω that
is covered in Fig. 2 (for 2.3 < η < 6.3) is shaded. Truncation
has a minor eﬀect for n = 1 and 2. For n = 3 this eﬀect is
becoming noticeable, and for n = 4 it is strong. All higher
excited states are eliminated by the truncations considered.

It is not surprising that ionization is aﬀected by the
resonances in a similar fashion as HHG. In Fig. 4 we plot
the normalization of the time-dependent wave function
at the end of the pulse, as a function of η for the trun-
cation parameters used in Fig. 2. This normalization is
smaller than unity, since part of the wave function is ab-
sorbed by a mask function, used in our computations to
eliminate spurious reﬂection eﬀects.
It is a good mea-
sure of irreversible ionization, since the mask function is
located at about ten times the electron excursion ampli-
tude. In the ﬁgure, there are clear dips slightly preceding
the intensities, for which the channel closings occur. The
particular case, for which |3i is absent, agrees with the
results in [14] for a zero-range potential.

There are still features in the enhancements, such as
their strength and harmonic range, which depend on the
atomic binding potential and are not yet completely un-
derstood.
In fact, studies performed by us for short-
and long-range potentials of various shapes indicate that,
even though the enhancements are a generic feature be-
ing present for all cases, their strength, regularity and
harmonic range depend on the potential in question. An
interesting feature is the fact that the enhancements are
weaker for short-range potentials. Since the tail of the
potential plays no role in this respect, the eﬀective po-
tential barrier may inﬂuence these features.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The picture that emerges from these calculations is
this: high-order harmonic generation can be strongly en-
hanced by a multiphoton resonance with a ponderomo-
tively upshifted excited bound state close to the contin-
uum threshold.
In the cases that we investigated the
relevant (ﬁeld-free) bound state |ni was the state where
|xn,max| ≈ α ≡ E0/ω2 with xn,max the value of x that
renders |hx|ni|2 maximal. Bound states higher than this
do not lead to noticeable enhancements, nor do the exis-
tence or nonexistence of a Rydberg series have an eﬀect,
neither on the enhancements nor on the entire harmonic
spectrum.
In all cases considered, the relevant bound
state was |n = 3i. When this state was eliminated by
suﬃcient truncation of the potential, the role of the reso-
nant bound state was taken over by the ponderomotively
upshifted continuum threshold. Hence, in all cases, the
resonant intensities are well described by Eq. (5), pro-
vided we employ an eﬀective continuum threshold that

is given by ˜ε ≡ ε0 − ε˜n where ε˜n is the energy of the cru-
cial bound state if such a state exists and zero otherwise.
Remarkably, if the value of ε˜n changes owing to a change
of the potential, the eﬀect on the harmonic spectrum
is largely a horizontal shift of the yield-versus-intensity
curve of the various harmonics.

This picture allows one, for the purposes of HHG, to
model the atom by a short-range or zero-range potential
using a binding energy that is adapted to the energy dif-
ference between the ground state and the relevant excited
state of the real atom that is supposed to be modeled.
In this case, excited states need not be considered and
the enhancement can be attributed to a multiphoton res-
onance with the continuum threshold and the generation
– in the three-step model – of an electron with a vanishing
drift momentum. The picture of an eﬀective continuum
threshold is also intuitively appealing:
in the presence
of a strong laser pulse, the highly excited states acquire
ﬁnite widths owing to ionization and the ﬁnite pulse du-
ration, so that the electron moves in a quasi-continuum.
In the case that we investigated (a0 = 3, L = 0.3α),
cf. Fig. 2, the enhancement as well as the general har-
monic yield were markedly reduced compared with the
untruncated potential. This is not so for a comparison
of a realistic single-active-electron binding potential to a
(regularized) zero-range potential in three spatial dimen-
sions, neither for HHG nor for ATI [18].

In conclusion, we have conﬁrmed the signiﬁcance of
resonant enhancements for high-order harmonic genera-
tion. The resonances occur, when an appropriate highly
excited state or, in the absence of such a state, the con-
tinuum threshold are ponderomotively upshifted so that
they become multiphoton resonant with the ground state.
The mechanism is similar to high-order above-threshold
ionization. In the latter case, remarkably, the multipho-
ton resonance continues to be signiﬁcant while the ion-
ization process is already deeply in the tunneling regime
[19]. For high-order harmonic generation, this remains
to be investigated.

TABLE I. Energies εn of the ﬁeld-free ground state and the ﬁrst four excited states for the untruncated potential (3) as well
as several truncated versions thereof, as considered in Fig. 2. No entry means that the state is no longer bound. Multiphoton
resonances with the respective state occur for intensities ηn = integer + ∆ηn.

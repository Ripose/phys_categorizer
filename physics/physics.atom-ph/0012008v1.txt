Abstract

We discuss the transport of matter waves in low-dimensional waveg-
uides. Due to scattering from uncontrollable noise ﬁelds, the spatial co-
herence gets reduced and eventually lost. We develop a description of this
decoherence process in terms of transport equations for the atomic Wigner
function. We outline its derivation and discuss the special case of white
noise where an analytical solution can be found.

Introduction

We discuss in this contribution the transport of atomic matter waves in a low-
dimensional waveguide. Such structures may be created close to solid substrates
using electro-magnetic ﬁelds: the magnetic ﬁeld of a current-carrying wire com-
bined with a homogeneous bias ﬁeld, e.g., gives rise to a linear waveguide [1, 2, 3].
Planar waveguides may be constructed with repulsive magnetic [4] or optical [5]
ﬁelds that ‘coat’ the substrate surface. The atomic motion is characterised by
bound vibrations in the ‘transverse’ direction(s) and an essentially free motion
in the ‘longitudinal’ direction(s) along the waveguide axis (plane), respectively.
Although direct contact with the substrate is avoided by the shielding potential,
the atoms feel its presence through enhanced electromagnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
that ‘leak’ out of the thermal solid, typically held at room temperature. We have
shown elsewhere that these thermal near ﬁelds are characterised by a ﬂuctua-
tion spectrum exceeding by orders of magnitude the usual blackbody radiation
[6, 7, 8, 9]. The scattering of the atoms oﬀ the near ﬁeld ﬂuctuations occurs at a
rate that may be calculated using Fermi’s Golden Rule. The consequences of mul-
tiple scattering is conveniently described by a transport equation that combines
in a self-consistent way both ballistic motion and scattering.

The purpose of this contribution is to outline a derivation of this transport
equation. The status of this equation is similar to that of the quantum-optical

1

master equations allowing to describe the evolution of the reduced density matrix
of an atomic system, on a time scale large compared to the correlation time of the
reservoir the system is coupled to, typically the vacuum radiation ﬁeld. In the
case of transport in waveguides, we face both temporal and spatial dynamics and
therefore restrict our attention to scales large compared to the correlation time
and length of a ﬂuctuating noise potential. Our analysis uses a multiple scale
expansion adapted from [10]. Similar to the quantum-optical case, we make an
expansion in the perturbing potential to second order. In the resulting transport
equation, the noise is thus characterised by its second-order correlation functions
or, equivalently, its spectral density.
In the case of white noise, the transport
equation can be explicitly solved. We have shown elsewhere [8] that this approxi-
mation holds quite well for thermal near ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. For technical noise, it
also holds when the noise spectrum is ﬂat on a frequency scale roughly set by the
‘longitudinal’ temperature of the atoms in the waveguide. The explicit solution
yields an estimate for the spatial coherence of the guided matter waves as a func-
tion of time. The paper concludes with some remarks on the limits of validity of
the present transport theory. It cannot describe, e.g., Anderson localisation in
one dimension [11] because on the coarser spatial scale of the transport equation,
the scattering from the noise ﬁeld is assumed to take place locally; interferences
between diﬀerent scattering sequences are not taken into account. Decoherence
in ‘curved’ or ‘split’ waveguides also needs a reﬁned theory because of the cross-
coupling between the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom, the former
being ‘frozen out’ in our framework.

1 Statistical matter wave optics

The simplest model for atom transport in a low-dimensional waveguide is based
on the Schr¨odinger equation

i¯h∂tψ(x, t) =

2ψ + V (x, t)ψ

¯h2
2m ∇

−

The coordinate x describes the motion in the free waveguide directions. The
transverse motion if ‘frozen out’ by assuming that the atom is cooled to the
transverse ground state. Atom-atom interactions are neglected, too. V (x, t) is
the noise potential: for a magnetic waveguide, e.g., it is given by

V (x, t) =

is the trapped internal state of the atom (we neglect spin-changing

where the average is taken over the realisations of the noise potential. We assume
a statistically homogeneous noise, the correlation function being independent of x
and t. As a function of the separation s, thermal magnetic ﬁelds are correlated on
a length scale lc given approximately by the distance d between the waveguide axis
and the solid substrate [8]. This estimate is valid as long as the wavelength 2πc/ω
corresponding to the noise frequency ω is large compared to d: for micrometre-
sized waveguide structures, this means frequencies below the optical range. The
relevant frequencies of the noise will be identiﬁed below and turn out to be much
smaller than this.

The coherence properties of the guided matter waves are characterised by the
noise-averaged coherence function (the time dependence is suppressed for clarity)

ρ(x; s) =

ψ∗(x

−
In complete analogy to quantum-optical master equations, this coherence function
may be regarded as the reduced density matrix of the atomic ensemble, when the
degrees of freedom of the noise are traced over. The Wigner function gives a
convenient representation of the coherence function:

i

W (x, p) =

dDs
(2π¯h)D e−ip·s/¯hρ(x; s),

Z

where D is the waveguide dimension. This representation allows to make a link
to classical kinetic theory: W (x, p) may be viewed as a quasi-probability in phase
space. For example, the spatial density n(x) and the current density j(x) of the
atoms are given by

We also obtain information about the spatial coherence: the spatially averaged
coherence function Γ(s, t), for example, is related to the Wigner function by

n(x) =

function in terms of the noise correlation function.

pendix A. We quote here only the main assumptions underlying the theory.

(i) The noise potential is supposed to be weak so that a perturbative analysis
is possible. As in quantum-optical master equations, a closed equation is
found when the expansion is pushed to second order in the perturbation.

(ii) The scale lc over which the noise is spatially correlated is assumed to be
small compared to the characteristic scale of variation of the Wigner func-
tion. This implies a separation of the dynamics on short and large spatial
scales, the dynamics on the large scale being ‘enslaved’ by certain averages
over the short scale. Similarly, we assume that the potential ﬂuctuates
rapidly on the time scale for the evolution of the Wigner function. These
assumptions correspond to the Markov approximation of quantum optics,
where the master equation is valid on a coarse-grained time scale.

The derivation of the master equation is based on a multiple scale expansion.

Functions f (x) of the spatial coordinate are thus written in the form

where X gives the ‘slow’ variation and the dimensionless variable ξ = x/lc gives
the ‘rapid’ variation on the scale of the noise correlation length lc. Spatial gradi-
ents are thus expanded using

f (x) = f (X, ξ)

x =

∇

∇

By construction, the ﬁrst term is much smaller than the second one. Finally, the
Wigner function is expanded as

where η
1 is the ratio between the correlation length lc and a ‘macroscopic’
scale on which the coordinate X varies. The expansion allows to prove self-
consistently that the zeroth order approximation W0 does not depend on the
short scale ξ, and to ﬁx the exponent 1/2 for the ﬁrst order correction.

The resulting transport equation speciﬁes the evolution of the Wigner function

to δ(∆E), and energy is conserved. If we are interested in the scattering between
guided momentum states, then the initial and ﬁnal energies Ep, Ep′ are typically
of the order of the (longitudinal) temperature kT of the ensemble. The relevant
frequencies in the noise spectral density are thus comparable to kT /¯h.

3 Results

3.1 White noise

White noise is characterised by a constant spectral density, i.e., the noise spec-
trum SV (q, ∆E) is independent of ∆E. Equivalently, the noise correlation is
δ-correlated in time:

CV (s, τ ) = BV (s) δ(τ ).
(15)
The integration over the momentum q′ in (13) is now not restricted by energy con-
servation, and the right hand side of the transport equation becomes a convolu-
tion. One therefore obtains a simple solution using Fourier transforms. Denoting
k (dimension: wavevector) and s (dim.: length) the Fourier variables conjugate
to x and p, we ﬁnd the equation

) = BV (0)/¯h2 for distances s

We can thus give a physical meaning to the quantity γ(s): it is the rate at which
two points in the matter wave ﬁeld, that are separated by a distance s, lose their
mutual coherence. This rate saturates to γ = γ(
≫
lc large compared to the correlation length of the noise ﬁeld (the correlation BV (s)
then vanishes). This saturation has been discussed, e.g., in [12]. As shown in [8],
the rate γ is equal to the total scattering rate from the noise potential, as obtained
from Fermi’s Golden Rule. For distances smaller than lc, the decoherence rate
γ(s) decreases since the two points of the matter wave ﬁeld ‘see’ essentially the
same noise potential. The exact solution (19) thus implies that after a time of
the order of the scattering time 1/γ, the spatial coherence of the atomic ensemble
has been reduced to the correlation length lc. The estimates given in [8] imply a
time scale of the order of a fraction of a second for waveguides at a micrometre
distance from a (bulk) metallic substrate. Signiﬁcant improvements can be made
using thin metallic layers or wires, nonconducting materials or by mounting the
waveguide at a larger distance from the substrate [8].

At timescales longer than the scattering time 1/γ, the spatial coherence length
of the atoms decreases more slowly, approximately as lc/√γt [8]. This is due to
a diﬀusive increase of the width of the atomic momentum distribution, with a
diﬀusion constant of the order of D = ¯h2γ/l2
c . This constant is in agreement with
for each scattering time 1/γ, the atoms
a random walk in momentum space:
absorb a momentum qc = ¯h/lc from the noise potential. The momentum step qc
follows from the fact that the noise potential is smooth on scales smaller than lc,
its Fourier transform therefore contains momenta up to ¯h/lc.

3.2 Fokker-Planck equation

The momentum diﬀusion estimate given above can also be retrieved from the
transport equation, making an expansion of the Wigner distribution as a function
of momentum. We assume that the typical momentum transfer qc absorbed from
the noise is small compared to the scale of variation of the Wigner distribution,
and expand the latter to second order. This manipulation casts the transport
equation into a Fokker-Planck form

where the drift force and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient are given by

In the special case of white noise, the p-dependence of these quantities drops out.
Also the drift force is then zero because the noise correlation function is real and
the spectrum SV (q) even in q. Since qc gives the width of the spectrum, the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient turns out to be of order q2

c γ, as estimated before.

Casting the transport equation into Fokker-Planck form, one can easily take
into account the scattering from the noise ﬁeld in (classical) Monte Carlo sim-
ulations of the atomic motion: one simply has to add a random force whose
correlation is given by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

We note, however, that the Fokker-Planck equation cannot capture the initial
stage of the decoherence process, starting from a wave ﬁeld that is coherent
over distances larger than the correlation length lc.
Indeed, it may be shown
(neglecting the p
x term and the drift force, assuming an isotropic diﬀusion
tensor for simplicity) that (20) yields a spatially averaged coherence function

This result implies a decoherence rate proportional to s2 without saturation. It
is hence valid only at large times (compared to the scattering time 1/γ) where
the exponentials in both solutions (19, 23) are essentially zero for s

lc.

4 Concluding remarks

We have given an outline of a transport theory for dilute atomic gases trapped
in low-dimensional waveguides. This theory allows to follow the evolution of
the atomic phase-space distribution (more precisely, the atomic, noise-averaged
Wigner function) when the atoms are subject to a noise potential with ﬂuctua-
tions in space and time. The spatial coherence of the gas can be tracked over
temporal and spatial scales larger than the correlation scale of the noise, in a man-
ner similar to the master equations of quantum optics. We have given explicit
results in the case of white noise, highlighting spatial decoherence and momentum
diﬀusion.

The transport equation has to be taken with care for strong noise poten-
tials because its derivation is based on second-order perturbation theory. It is
¯v/γ (¯v is a typical velocity of
certainly not valid when the ‘mean free path’
the gas) is smaller than the noise correlation length lc because then the Wigner
distribution changes signiﬁcantly over a small spatial scale. (In technical terms,
the approximation of a local scattering kernel in (13) is no longer appropriate.)
Also, the theory cannot describe Anderson localisation in 1D waveguides with
static noise [11]. This can be seen by working out the scattering kernel with
SV (q, ∆E) = SV (q) δ(∆E):

We ﬁnd a divergence of the scattering rate at p
0 since the spectrum SV (2p)
is ﬁnite in this limit. The one-dimensional, static case therefore merits further
investigation. We also mention that is has been found recently that Anderson
localisation is destroyed when time-dependent ﬂuctuations are superimposed on
the static disorder [13, 14].
In this context, transport (or master) equations
similar to our approach have been used.

This may be justiﬁed heuristically as follows: it seems reasonable that the statis-

average over the small-scale ﬂuctuations of the medium. This is precisely the pic-
ture behind transport theory: the individual scattering events are not resolved
but only the behaviour of the matter wave on larger scales. The lowest order
Wigner function W0 may be taken out of the coarse grain average because it does
not depend on the short scale ξ by construction.

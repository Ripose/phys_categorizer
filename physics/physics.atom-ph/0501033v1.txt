1. Introduction

Abstract. We have experimentally observed re-equilibration of a magnetically
trapped cloud of metastable neon atoms after it was put in a non-equilibrium state.
Using numerical simulations we show that anharmonic mixing, equilibration due to
the collisionless dynamics of atoms in a magnetic trap, is the dominant process in this
equilibration. We determine the dependence of its time on trap parameters and atom
temperature. Furthermore we observe in the simulations a resonant energy exchange
between the radial and axial trap dimensions at a ratio of trap frequencies ωr/ωz = 3/2.
This resonance is explained by a simple oscillator model.

Magnetic traps have become a standard and inexpensive tool in cold atom physics in
recent years [1]. Together with the application of cooling techniques such as evaporative
cooling and sympathetic cooling, they have enabled the formation of Bose-Einstein
condensates [2] and, more recently, degenerate Fermi gases [3]. The most commonly
used species for cold atom experiments (Rb, Cs, Na) are easily cooled to the micro-
Kelvin regime, where the atomic dynamics in a magnetic trap is usually well described
by regular harmonic motion. For other species such as the noble gases [4, 5] and the
group II elements [6, 7] however, the lowest attainable temperatures can be in the milli-
Kelvin regime. In this regime the atomic dynamics is more complicated, with coupling
between the diﬀerent dimensions of the trap becoming important.

Anharmonic mixing is a process that couples the motion of atoms in diﬀerent
dimensions of a magnetic trap. This coupling enables redistribution of energy over
the coupled dimensions. Therefore, anharmonic mixing has to be considered when
applying techniques that rely on the motion of atoms in a trap, such as evaporative
cooling [8], Doppler cooling in a magnetic trap [9] and rethermalization experiments
aimed at measuring a scattering length [10]. In order to investigate on what timescale

anharmonic mixing plays a role, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation of a cloud of
atoms in a Ioﬀe-Quadrupole magnetic trap. We determine the dependence of this
timescale on trap parameters and on atom temperature. Surkov et. al. [11] have
investigated anharmonic mixing in the limit of low temperature where it can be treated
as a perturbation of regular harmonic motion, but to the best of our knowledge this is the
ﬁrst paper discussing anharmonic mixing at higher temperatures. We will also present
here an experiment showing that anharmonic mixing does play an important role in the
atomic dynamics, and can even be the dominant mechanism of energy redistribution
under certain conditions. To conclude we will look at possible applications of anharmonic
mixing.

A Ioﬀe-Quadrupole magnetic trap (MT) is one of the most common magnetic traps. Its
potential is given by

U(x, y, z) = µ[B2

0 + (α2 − B0β)(x2 + y2) + 2B0βz2

+

β2(x2 + y2)2 + β2z4 + 2αβ(x2 − y2)z]1/2 − µB0,

(1)

where x and y are the radial trap dimensions, z is the axial trap dimension, µ is the
magnetic moment of the atom, α the gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld, β the curvature of
the magnetic ﬁeld and B0 the magnetic bias ﬁeld. In this expression for the trap potential
terms of order higher than four have been neglected. The MT has trap frequencies ωr
and ωz in the limit 3kBT ≪ µB0, where the trap shape is harmonic:
r r2 + ω2

U(r, z) =

z z2).

(ω2

(2)

m(α2/B0−β)]1/2
Here m is the atomic mass, r = (x2+y2)1/2 the radial coordinate, ωr = [ µ
the radial trap frequency, and ωz = (µβ/m)1/2 the axial trap frequency. The higher
order terms in (1) are in this limit negligible compared to the harmonic terms, the term
2αβ(x2 − y2)z that couples the motion in the axial and radial directions is therefore
absent from (2).

The starting point of a simulation is an atom cloud in equilibrium in a harmonic
trap. The initial positions and velocities of the atoms are determined by a Monte Carlo
method. For the properties of the atom we use the values for metastable neon in the
3P2 state, as this is the atom we use in our experiment. Two kinds of clouds have been
used, namely thermal clouds and clouds in which all the atoms have the same energy.
The former is used to compare the results of the simulations with experiments while
the latter is used to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of atoms at a certain
energy. During the simulation the position and velocity of each atom is determined as a
function of time by integrating the equations of motion. At the start of the simulation
the magnetic bias ﬁeld B0 is adiabatically ramped down, thereby increasing the energy
of the atoms in the radial direction and changing the eﬀective shape of the potential
from harmonic to almost linear. The ramping is adiabatic if the condition 1

is fulﬁlled [11]. The simulation yields the kinetic and potential energies of the cloud in
every direction as a function of time. From the kinetic energies in diﬀerent directions the
transfer of energy from one direction to the other can be determined, and a comparison
with the experiment can be made.

We choose the trap parameters at the start of the simulation as α = 1 · 104 G/m,
β = 47.5 · 104 G/m2 and B0 = 99.6 G. The bias ﬁeld is then ramped down to 1.5 G.
These parameters are chosen because they are easily accessible in our experiment. A
typical calculated result of the temperature evolution, or the average kinetic energy, in
the radial direction of a thermal cloud of 1 mK after ramping the bias ﬁeld is shown in
Figure 1. The ﬁrst few tens of milliseconds show a linear decrease of temperature, after
that the decrease is approximately exponential with a mixing time of 112 ms for this
particular cloud with a temperature of 1 mK and a relative change in temperature of
8%. The linear decrease of temperature in the ﬁrst tens of ms is caused by high-energy
atoms that mix on a timescale of 1
z = 11 ms. This is the average time an atom needs
to reach a singular point in the potential [11], where almost instantaneous mixing can
occur.

2ω−1

The dependence of the behavior of a thermal cloud on initial trap parameters and
cloud temperature is relatively weak. When α is varied over the range 0.9−1.2·104 G/m
and B0,end over the range 1.5 − 20 G, the mixing time stays within the range 100 − 130
ms. Only when β is decreased, a signiﬁcant change in mixing time occurs: τmix ≈ 400
ms when β = 37.5 · 104 G/m2. The reason for this weak dependence on trap parameters
is that a signiﬁcant part of the energy of the cloud is carried by atoms that are in a
regime where mixing does not occur or where it occurs on a timescale of 1

2ω−1
z .

To show that indeed the timescale of energy transfer between dimensions of an
atom depends strongly on the energy of that atom, we now take clouds of atoms that
all have the same energy Eatom in order to determine the mixing timescale as a function

of energy. This gives us the average behavior of an atom with a certain energy. The
result is shown in Figure 2. Below Eatom/3kB = 375 µK no mixing occurs on the longest
timescale we considered, i.e. the lifetime of the metastable state Ne∗(3P2) of 14.7 s [12].
For temperatures above 1.5 mK the mixing time is determined by 1
and becomes
independent of energy.

Next, we investigate the dependence of τmix on the trap parameters α and β
while keeping the energy constant at Eatom/3kB = 700 µK. Figure 3 shows that τmix
increases with α and decreases with β. This behavior can be understood qualitatively
by comparing the strength of the harmonic (∼ α2 − β) and coupling (∼ αβ) terms in
(1).

Furthermore we determined the mixing time as a function of the value of the bias
ﬁeld at the end of the ramp. When the ﬁnal value of the bias ﬁeld is higher, less energy
is added to the atoms and the ﬁnal temperature of the cloud is lower. Therefore we
expect that the mixing time becomes larger for higher ﬁnal values of the bias ﬁeld. As
can be seen from the result in Figure 4 however, there is a broad resonance (meaning
small mixing time) in the mixing time around 14 G. This occurs exactly at a ratio of
radial and axial trap frequencies of ωr/ωz = 3/2. The resonance is so broad because
the radial trap frequency changes only very slowly with bias ﬁeld. The reason for this
slow change is that at higher bias ﬁeld the ﬁnal energy of the cloud is lower, resulting
in a higher oscillation frequency in the MT because the trap is not harmonic, but at the
same time the trap is less tightly conﬁning, resulting in a lower oscillation frequency.
These two eﬀects almost completely cancel.

3. Resonance model

In order to explain this resonance the dynamics of an atom in the MT is now described
as two coupled one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, whose energies represent the radial

in Figure 5. Now we examine the forces Fz and Fx that the two oscillators exert on one

eigenfrequency, Fi ∼ cos(ωit). From (3) it can be seen that this happens if ωz = 2ωx.
In general, a coupling term xazb yields a resonance at aωx = bωz. When potential (1)
is linearized a term x2z3 appears, explaining the resonance in Figure 4. A more formal
treatment explaining the resonance is possible by transforming the Hamiltonian of an
atom in the potential to Birkhoﬀ-Gustavson normal form [13, 14], but that is beyond
the scope of this paper.

4. Experiment

To check our simulation results, we now compare with experiment. The only diﬀerence
between simulation and experiment is that in the experiment the atoms can also collide,
which we did not include in the simulation. Therefore it is necessary to consider both
anharmonic mixing and collisional equilibration of energy. Our setup has been described
previously in [5, 15]. Brieﬂy, a discharge source is used to create metastable 3P2 neon
atoms, and after passing through several laser-cooling sections the atomic beam ﬂux is
6 · 1010 s−1 [5]. From this atomic beam about 109 atoms are loaded into a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) at a temperature of 1 mK. These atoms can be transferred to
a Ioﬀe-Quadrupole magnetic trap with almost unity eﬃciency. To match the size
and temperature of our MOT the trap parameters are chosen as α = 1 · 104 G/m,
β = 47.5 · 104 G/m2 and B0 = 99.6 G. The MT has trap frequencies of ωr = (2π)376
Hz and ωz = (2π)44.7 Hz.

For this experiment the MOT was operated at a detuning of −2Γ and at an intensity
of 0.5 mW/cm2 for the three MOT beams together. After turning oﬀ the MOT, a 50
µs long σ+ spin polarization pulse of 2 mW/cm2 was given to put all the atoms in
the |mJ = +2 > state, and then the MT was turned on. The atom cloud now has a
temperature of approximately 1 mK and contains approximately 1 · 109 atoms. After
turning on the MT the atoms are held there long enough to allow the atom cloud to
reach its equilibrium state. Then the bias ﬁeld is ramped from 99.6 G to 1.5 G, adding

energy to the atoms in the radial direction and compressing them spatially. The cloud
radius in the radial direction as a function of time after the ramping is determined by
absorption imaging. The radius is directly proportional to the potential energy and
therefore the temperature because the trap shape is linear. A typical result of a series
of measurements is shown in Figure 6.

The exponential ﬁt gives a characteristic equilibration time of 130 ± 25 ms and
a relative change in width of 5 ± 3%. This result agrees with the timescale of the
simulation as found from the data in Figure 1. If the equilibration would be due solely
to collisions, this would give a collisional cross-section of σ = 8π·(200a0)2, with a0 the
Bohr radius. However, the cross-section at 1 mK can not be larger than the unitary
limit σ = 8π(λdB/2π)2 = 8π·(80a0)2. Here λdB is the thermal de Broglie wavelength
of the atom. Also, we did not observe a dependence of the equilibration time on the
atomic density, indicating that anharmonic mixing is the dominant mechanism here.

5. Applications

An interesting application for anharmonic mixing is to use it to enhance the eﬃciency of
Doppler cooling in a magnetic trap. This cooling technique is one-dimensional because
only along the axial direction of an MT all atoms are polarized the same way. Cooling
in the radial directions can be achieved by reabsorption of scattered photons [16] if the
cloud is optically dense. If that is not the case anharmonic mixing can cool the radial
directions, as shown in an early experiment by Helmerson et. al. [9]. By making the
mixing time as short as possible the cooling can be fast and the atom losses as a result
of the cooling can be limited.

Another technique that could beneﬁt from anharmonic mixing is evaporative
cooling. One of the problems that can occur when an atom cloud is cooled evaporatively

Anharmonic mixing in a magnetic trap

is gravitational sag, in which gravity shifts the equipotential surfaces of atoms in a
trap in such a way that they do not coincide with the surfaces of constant magnetic
ﬁeld. This causes the cooling process to become one or two-dimensional, reducing its
eﬃciency [17].
If the dimensions are coupled by anharmonic mixing the evaporation
remains three-dimensional even when gravity plays a role.

A situation where anharmonic mixing is undesirable and needs to be suppressed
is in rethermalization experiments to measure the scattering length [10, 18]. The
scattering length is one of the properties of an atom that determine the feasibility of
evaporative cooling and reaching the transition point of Bose-Einstein condensation
for a given number of atoms at a certain density and temperature [8].
It can be
measured by observing collisional equilibration after ramping the bias ﬁeld as we did
in our simulations and experiment. We can conclude that this method will only yield
reliable results if the timescale on which anharmonic mixing occurs is long compared to
the collision time.

6. Conclusion

We determined the timescale on which anharmonic mixing occurs and the dependence
of that timescale on trap parameters and atom temperature. We observed a resonance
in the mixing time as a function of the end bias ﬁeld, and explained this with a simple
oscillator model. We veriﬁed experimentally that anharmonic mixing does indeed occur,
and that its timescale can be short compared to the timescale needed for collisional
equilibration. The application of anharmonic mixing to improve Doppler cooling and
lower-dimensional evaporative cooling is possible.

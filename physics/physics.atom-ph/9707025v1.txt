With radiofrequency ﬁelds one can control ultracold atoms
in magnetic traps. These ﬁelds couple the atomic spin states,
and are used in evaporative cooling which can lead to Bose-
Einstein condensation in the atom cloud. Also, they can be
used in controlled release of the condensate from the trap,
thus providing output couplers for atom lasers.
In this pa-
per we show that the time-dependent multistate models for
these processes have exact solutions which are polynomials of
the solutions of the corresponding two-state models. This
allows simple,
in many cases analytic descriptions for the
time-dependent control of the magnetically trapped ultracold
atoms.

Neutral atoms possessing hyperﬁne structure can be
trapped in spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds, if
they are in the appropriate spin state. As the magnetic
ﬁeld imposes spin-dependent Zeeman shifts on the atomic
energy levels, a spatially changing magnetic ﬁeld maps
into an external potential felt by the atom (see Fig. 1).
The magnetic traps are, however, very shallow, so only
ultracold atoms can be trapped. For alkali atoms the
proper temperatures have been obtained via precooling
with laser light. Once the atoms are trapped, one can
decrease the trap depth, which allows the hot atoms to
escape, and those left behind thermalize via collisions
into a lower temperature—this is called evaporative cool-
ing [1]. By combining magnetic traps with evaporative
cooling one can now reach the densities and temperatures
where Bose-Einstein condensation takes place [2]. Then
the atoms form a coherent superposition, which can be
released from the trap [3]. As the escaping atoms main-
tain their coherence [4], the experiment is a prototype for
an atom laser, i.e., production of coherent, propagating
packets of matter waves.

Evaporative cooling requires eﬀective and precise con-
trol of the trap depth. This can be achieved by cou-
pling the spin states (labeled with the magnetic quantum
number m) with a radiofrequency (rf) ﬁeld [1,5,6]. The
coupling introduces transitions between the neighbouring
spin states (∆m =
1). As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the
frequency ωrf of the ﬁeld controls the depth of the trap. If
we want to estimate the eﬃciency of evaporative cooling,
we can transform the rf resonances into curve crossings,
and describe the dynamics of the atoms at the edge of the
trap with an appropriate time-dependent curve crossing

how the radiofrequency ﬁeld (frequency ωrf ) can be used

model [1], see Fig. 2. Typically one compares the trap os-
cillation period times the spin-change probability at the
resonance point to the other time scales of the trapping
and cooling process, including collisional loss rates [1].

However, as one usually operates in the region where
Zeeman shifts are linear, the rf ﬁeld couples sequentially
all spin states, instead of just selecting a certain pair of
states. In case of only two spin states we can use the stan-
dard Landau-Zener model in estimates of the eﬃciency of
evaporative cooling. In practice, however, one has 2f + 1
states, where f is the hyperﬁne quantum number of the
atomic state used for trapping. So far condensates have
been realised for f = 1 and f = 2, but experiments
e.g. with cesium involve states with f = 3 and f = 4, so
in order to achieve eﬃcient evaporative cooling one needs
several sequential rf-induced transitions. Clearly the use
of the two-state Landau-Zener model can be questioned
in these multistate cases.

Once

the Bose-Einstein condensation has been

1

achieved one can release the condensate just by switch-
ing the magnetic ﬁeld oﬀ. This technique, however, does
not allow much control over the release. Moreover, it al-
ways involves all the atoms. With rf ﬁelds one can trans-
form parts of the condensate into untrapped states, in
which they are typically accelerated away—this has been
demonstrated experimentally [3], as well as the fact that
the released atoms are in a coherent superposition [4],
thus justifying the term “atom laser”. This output cou-
pling process can be achieved either by using rf pulses
which are resonant at the trap center, or by using chirped
rf ﬁelds. Both correspond to a multistate Hamiltonian,
where either the diagonal terms (chirping) or the oﬀ-
diagonal terms (rf pulses) have explicit time dependence.
In Ref. [3] the output coupling process was demonstrated
experimentally for the sodium f = 1 situation, and the
transition probabilities were in good agreement with the
predictions of time-dependent three-state models.

Both evaporative cooling and output coupling demon-
strate the need to have analytic solutions for the time-
dependent multistate models of the rf-induced dynamics.
Although these models can be easily solved numerically,
they are often used only as a part of a bigger theoret-
ical description, in which the dependence of the solu-
tions on the parameters such as the frequency and in-
tensity of the rf ﬁeld, or chirp parameters and shapes
of pulse envelopes are required. Instead of looking into
the known eﬀects of rf ﬁelds, we can consider the ef-
fects ﬁrst, and then look how we need to tailor the rf
ﬁeld in order to achieve what we want—in this approach
the analytic models show clearly their supremacy. Fur-
thermore, as we show in this Letter, the description of
the rf-induced multistate processes is closely connected
to the two-state processes, which means that the wealth
of knowledge on two-state models that has been accumu-
lated in the past [7,8] can be applied—and tested—with
Bose-Einstein condensates.

µ

First we need to derive the Hamiltonian describing
the rf-induced processes. The ﬁeld B = B0 cos(ωrf t)erf
couples to the atomic magnetic moment µ, i.e., Hint =
B. The matrix elements of this coupling between
−
the magnetic states of the same hyperﬁne manifold are
nonzero only if ∆m =
1. Furthermore, using the angu-
lar momentum algebra we see that the couplings between
neighbouring states have the form [1,9]

Here we have applied the rotating wave approximation
and eliminated the ﬁeld terms oscillating with frequency
ωrf . This leads to the curve crossing picture of the atomic
potentials [8].

In the regime of the linear Zeeman eﬀect the energy

FIG. 2. The curve crossing description of trap dynamics.
The potentials are obtained by shifting the atomic states by
multiples of rf photon energies. The region near the resonance
point can be modelled with a bowtie crossing as shown in
the enlargement of the grey area. Assuming that an atom
traverses the crossing with some constant velocity vc, we can
map the position-dependent crossing into a time-dependent
one, which in the special case of two states corresponds to
the widely used and well-known Landau-Zener model. In the
optimal, i.e., adiabatic case the hot atoms follow the route
marked by arrows out of the trap.

By substituting ˙a1 and ˙a2, found from the ﬁrst and third
equation, into the second we conclude that the latter will
be satisﬁed identically if λ2

is readily seen that if we take λ1 = λ3 = 1, λ2 = √2,
the ﬁrst and third equations for a1 and a2 reduce ex-
actly to Eqs. (6). Thus the solution to the three-state
equations (7) is indeed expressed in terms of the solu-
tion (a1, a2) of the two-state equations (6): c1 = a2

In estimating the spin-change probabilities for evapo-

Thus our model provides the exact result for the transi-
tion probabilities in the generalized multistate Landau-
Zener model, which can be used in estimating the ef-
ﬁciency of the evaporative cooling [1]. As an example
we show the f = 2 situation in Fig. 3, where the ﬁnal
populations are plotted as a function of the adiabaticity
parameter Ω2
0/a. As expected, in the multistate case one
needs larger values of Ω2
0/a to achieve population inver-
sion, than in the two-state case.

The Landau-Zener model can also describe the chirped
output coupling. Then the atoms are assumed to be sta-
tionary, so the time-dependence in ∆ arises from the
time-dependent change in ωrf (chirp), which is typically
linear in time. In Ref. [3] the three-state version of the
result (16) was successfully used in describing the corre-
sponding experiment in sodium f = 1 system. However,
there the model was introduced only intuitively, and jus-
tiﬁed merely by a comparison with numerical solutions
to Eq. (3). Here we have provided the proof that the
f = 1 solution is exact, and furthermore, derived the ex-
act solution for any f . The special case of the three-state
Landau-Zener model is also studied in Ref. [12].

Instead of a chirped ﬁeld one can use resonant pulsed
output coupling, which was also demonstrated in Ref. [3].
For any resonant pulse we have ∆ = 0 and thus the two-
state system follows the area theorem [7,8]:

p = sin2(A/2),

A = 2

where A is deﬁned as the pulse area, typically A

(here Ω0 is the pulse peak amplitude and T is the pulse

duration).
In the MIT experiment [3] the number of
atoms left in the trap oscillated as a function of the area
of a resonant square pulse, exactly as Eqs. 16 and (19)
predict. However, our model is not limited to resonant
pulses only. For oﬀ-resonant pulses (∆ = const
= 0) in
two-state systems there are several known analytic solu-
tions, which are reviewed e.g. in Refs. [7,8].

The purely time-dependent output coupler models de-
scribed above are valid only if the time scales for the rf-
induced interaction and the spatial dynamics of the con-
densate are very diﬀerent. In molecular systems one ex-
pects interesting eﬀects when the excitation process and
internal dynamics of the molecule couple [8]. It might be
possible to realize some of the predicted molecular wave
packet phenomena using condensates.

In this Letter we have shown that any time-dependent
multistate model describing the rf-induced coupling be-
tween the diﬀerent atomic spins states within the same
hyperﬁne manifold can always be solved in terms of the
solution of the corresponding two-state model. The fact
that these models play a crucial role in time-dependent
control of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms adds sig-
niﬁcantly to the importance of this result, which is also
in general quite fascinating.

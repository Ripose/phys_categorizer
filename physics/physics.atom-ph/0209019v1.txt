Abstract

We demonstrate a new technique for measuring the absolute frequencies of
atomic transitions. The technique uses a ring-cavity resonator whose length is
calibrated using a reference laser locked to the D2 line in 87Rb. The frequency
of this line is known to be 384 230 484.468(10) MHz. Using a second laser
locked to the D1 line of Rb, we measure the frequencies of various hyperﬁne
transitions in the D1 and D2 lines with a precision of 30 kHz. We obtain
the following values: 120.687(17) MHz and 406.520(25) MHz for the 5P1/2
hyperﬁne constant A in 85Rb and 87Rb; 377 107 385.623(50) MHz and 377 107
463.209(50) MHz for the D1 line in 85Rb and 87Rb; and 384 230 406.528(50)
MHz for the D2 line in 85Rb. This yields the ﬁne-structure interval and
the isotope shifts. The precision obtained is a signiﬁcant improvement over
previous measurements.

Precise measurements of atomic energy levels continue to play an important role in
the development of physics. The energy levels of alkali atoms are particularly important
because of their widespread use in laser-cooling experiments, ultra-cold collision studies,
photoassociation spectroscopy, atomic tests of parity violation, and more recently in Bose-
Einstein condensation. For example, measurement of the D1 line in Cs can lead to an
improved value for the ﬁne-structure constant α [1].
In addition, knowledge of the ﬁne-
structure interval in the D line of alkali atoms is important for several reasons, e.g. in the
study of atomic collisions, astrophysical processes, and relativistic calculations of atomic
energy levels.

In this Letter, we demonstrate a new technique for precisely measuring the energy levels
of atoms. The technique combines the advantages of using diode lasers to access atomic
transitions with the fact that the absolute frequency of the D2 line in 87Rb has been measured
with an accuracy of a few kHz [2]. A stabilized diode laser locked to the D2 line of 87Rb is
used as a frequency reference along with a ring-cavity resonator whose length is measured
with the reference laser. For a given cavity length, an unknown laser locked to an atomic
transition has a small frequency oﬀset from the nearest cavity resonance. This oﬀset acts as
a vernier scale and is combined with the cavity mode number to obtain a precise value for the
frequency of the unknown laser. We have used this method to make precise measurements
of energy levels in the D lines of Rb. This yields the hyperﬁne structure in the 5P1/2 state
and the D1 − D2 ﬁne-structure interval. We demonstrate a precision of 30 kHz, which is
two to three orders of magnitude better than the typical accuracy of energy-level tables [3].
While we have measured energy levels only in Rb, the technique is more general and should
prove useful in other alkali atoms (such as Li, K, and Na), alkali-like ions, and indeed any
system where the transitions are accessible with tunable lasers.

Similar measurements have been done previously using a stabilized HeNe laser as the
frequency reference and a linear Fabry-Perot resonator [4]. Our use of a Rb-stabilized diode
laser as the reference has the primary advantage that there are several hyperﬁne transitions
that can be used for locking the laser. This enables us to check diﬀerent sources of systematic
errors. Our use of a ring-cavity resonator also has several advantages. The main problem
with a linear resonator is that it can cause unwanted feedback into the diode laser and
destabilize it. By contrast, the ring-cavity resonator has a traveling wave inside the cavity
and there is no possibility of feedback into the laser. The other advantages of the ring cavity
are: i) The cavity provides three output beams that can be used to measure the cavity signal.
ii) The mode structure inside the cavity is elliptical which makes it easier to mode-match
the elliptical output of the diode laser into the cavity.
iii) For a given cavity length, the
design is more compact and the cavity is easily temperature stabilized to increase its passive
stability.

The schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. The experiment uses two diode lasers
that are both locked to hyperﬁne transitions in Rb using Doppler-free saturated-absorption
spectroscopy. Laser 1 is on the D1 line (whose frequency has to be measured) and Laser
2 is on the D2 line (which acts as the frequency reference). The output of the two lasers
is fed into the ring-cavity resonator. In general, the length of the cavity is such that the
cavity is not in resonance with either laser. The cavity length is adjusted using a piezo-
mounted mirror to bring it into resonance with the wavelength of Laser 1. The cavity is
then locked to this length in a feedback loop. However, Laser 2 will still be oﬀset from the

2

cavity resonance. This oﬀset is accounted for by shifting the frequency of the laser using an
acousto-optic modulator (AOM) before it enters the cavity. The error signal between the
shifted frequency of Laser 2 and the cavity resonance is fed back to the AOM driver which
locks the frequency of the AOM at the correct oﬀset. The frequency of the AOM is read using
a frequency counter and thus the exact oﬀset between the two lasers is determined. The
absolute frequency of Laser 2 is known with 10 kHz accuracy [2], therefore, once the cavity
length (or mode number) is known, the frequency of Laser 1 is determined very precisely.

The relevant low-lying energy levels for the two isotopes of Rb are shown in Fig. 2.
The various hyperﬁne levels in the ground and excited states are given along with their
energy shifts from the unperturbed state. Knowledge of the shift is important in obtaining
the hyperﬁne-free transition frequency. The ground-state shifts are known with sub-kHz
accuracy [5]. The shifts in the 5P3/2 state have been measured with an accuracy of 50 kHz
for 85Rb [6] and with an accuracy of 10 kHz for 87Rb [2]. However, for the 5P1/2 state, the
values have large error bars of order 1 MHz [5]. In this work, we have improved these values
by one to two orders of magnitude.

The diode lasers are standard external-cavity lasers stabilized using optical feedback from
a piezo-mounted grating [7]. Large scans of the laser frequency are possible by changing the
angle of the grating. The current through the diodes is dithered at a frequency of 10–50 kHz
to produce the error signal needed for locking. The ring cavity consists of two plane mirrors
and two concave mirrors in a bow-tie arrangement. One of the plane mirrors is partially
reﬂecting (97%) and is used to couple light into the cavity. The other plane mirror is
mounted on a piezoelectric transducer and is used to adjust the cavity length electronically.
The two concave mirrors have radius of curvature of 25 mm. They are placed 26.5 mm
apart, while the optical path length between them through the plane mirrors is 200 mm.
The angle of incidence on all mirrors is 15◦. The mirrors are mounted on a copper plate that
is temperature controlled to ±0.01◦C using a thermoelectric cooler. The primary mode of
the cavity has two beam waists, both of which are elliptical because of the non-zero angle
of incidence on the curved mirrors. The large waist between the plane mirrors is used for
eﬃcient mode matching. The elliptic beams from the diode lasers are mode matched into
the cavity using a convex lens.

The signal from a scan of Laser 2 is shown in Fig. 3. The upper trace is the power
transmitted through the cavity, while the lower trace is the signal from the saturated-
absorption spectrometer. The cavity length was ﬁxed by locking it to Laser 1. It is seen
from the ﬁgure that the hyperﬁne peaks are slightly shifted from the nearest cavity resonance.
This is the shift that is accounted for by the AOM. The laser is locked to one of the peaks
in the saturated-absorption spectrum using third-harmonic locking. This eliminates any
systematic shift in the lock point due to the underlying Doppler proﬁle in the spectrum.
Note that the spectrum shown in the ﬁgure has the Doppler proﬁle subtracted. Laser 1
is similarly locked to the saturated-absorption spectrum of the D1 line using the third-
derivative signal. However, locking to the cavity is to the standard ﬁrst-derivative signal
since this signal appears on a ﬂat background.

The measurements rely on the fact that the cavity mode number for each laser is known
exactly. For Laser 2, we determine it in the following manner. We ﬁrst ﬁx the cavity length
by locking it to Laser 1. We then ﬁnd the frequency oﬀsets for two hyperﬁne transitions of
Laser 2: F = 1 → F ′ = (1, 2) and F = 2 → F ′ = (2, 3). From Fig. 2, the frequency diﬀerence

3

between these two transitions is exactly 6622.887(10) MHz. Since the cavity free-spectral
range is about 1324 MHz, this corresponds to an increase in mode number by 5. Therefore,
the two measured oﬀsets are combined with the known shift to give a precise measurement
of the cavity free spectral range. This determines the mode number uniquely. Once the
mode number for Laser 2 is known, it is easy to ﬁnd the mode number for Laser 1 as long as
we know its frequency with an accuracy of about 50 MHz. This coarse measurement is done
using a home-built wavemeter [7]. Note that the cavity length on resonance is an integer
multiple of the laser wavelength, therefore, we have to account for the refractive index of air
[8] when converting from frequency to wavelength.

The measurements of various hyperﬁne transitions are listed in Table I. Each value is
an average over 50 individual measurements and the error given is the statistical error in
the average. Systematic errors in the data can arise if there is any shift in the lock point
of the lasers from the peak and optical-pumping eﬀects from stray magnetic ﬁelds that
change the lineshape of the spectrum. To check for such errors, we have repeated the
same measurement using diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions for locking the reference laser. For
example, measurements 1 and 2 in Table I are measurements of the same transition with the
reference laser on the F = 1 → F ′ = 1 and F = 2 → F ′ = (1, 3) transitions, respectively.
If there is any systematic shift in the lock point of the reference laser, this would appear
as a diﬀerence in the two values. Similarly, 3 and 4 are independent measurements of the
same transition. Finally, 7 and 8 are measurements of the D2 line in 85Rb. For these two
measurements, the role of the lasers is reversed since the unknown laser is on the D2 line
and Laser 1 acts as the reference laser. We use our measured values for the D1 line to
obtain these values. These two measurements act as another check on the propagation of
systematic errors since the diﬀerence between these values should be 31.705(50) MHz from
Fig. 2. These checks on systematic errors enable us to estimate the size of the error in
the individual frequencies to be no larger than 30 kHz. In what follows, the errors quoted
include 30 kHz of systematic error.

We ﬁrst analyze our results in terms of the hyperﬁne structure of the D1 line. Using
the measured interval between the two hyperﬁne levels in the 5P1/2 state, we extract the
value of the hyperﬁne constant A in each isotope. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The
values we obtain are 120.687(17) MHz for 85Rb and 406.520(25) MHz for 87Rb. Also shown
in the ﬁgure is the comparison to earlier values: the recommended values of Arimondo et al.
obtained from ﬁtting to all the available data [5], and the more recent results of Barwood
et al. using a HeNe-stabilized Fabry-Perot interferometer [4]. Our results are consistent
with the values of Arimondo et al. but have 2 to 3 orders of magnitude better accuracy.
However, our values diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those reported by Barwood et al. even though
their claimed error bars are slightly smaller. Note that their values also appear inconsistent
with the recommended values.

We have also obtained the frequencies of the hyperﬁne-free D lines and the ﬁne-structure
interval in Rb using the data from Table I. The results of this analysis are shown in Table II.
The isotope shift is 77.586(70) MHz in the D1 line and is 77.940(50) MHz in the D2 line. The
ﬁne-structure interval is 7 123 020.905(70) MHz in 85Rb and 7 123 021.259(50) MHz in 87Rb,
yielding a value of 0.354(90) MHz for the isotope shift in the interval. The accuracy of these
values is signiﬁcantly better than what has been reported earlier. The D-line frequencies
in the published atomic energy tables have an accuracy of 300 MHz [3]. Barwood et al. [4]

4

have reported a value of 377 106 271.6 MHz for the D1 line of 85Rb (F = 3 → F ′ = 3) with
an error of 0.4 MHz. Our values for the same transition (measurements 1 and 2 in Table
I) are consistent but the accuracy is an order of magnitude better. For the ﬁne-structure
interval, we have earlier reported a value of 7 123 069(18) MHz using a scanning Michelson
interferometer [9], which overlaps with the current result at the 2.5σ level. To the best of
our knowledge, there are no other measurements of the ﬁne-structure interval.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique for measuring the absolute frequen-
cies of atomic transitions using a Rb-stabilized ring-cavity resonator. We have measured the
frequencies of the D lines in the two isotopes of Rb and signiﬁcantly improved the preci-
sion of the ﬁne-structure interval. We have also obtained improved values for the hyperﬁne
structure in the 5P1/2 state. The main advantage of using a Rb-stabilized diode laser as
the frequency reference is that it has several hyperﬁne transitions available for locking the
laser, and the frequency shifts of these hyperﬁne levels are known very precisely. This is
useful in measuring the mode number of the cavity. It also allows us to make several checks
on systematic errors by making independent measurements of the same transition with dif-
ferent lock-points of the reference laser. We believe that this technique has the potential
to improve the accuracy of atomic energy-level tables by several orders of magnitude. To
demonstrate this, we plan to measure transitions in other atoms such as K and Yb.

ring-cavity resonator. Laser 1 is the unknown laser locked to an atomic transition on the D1
line. The cavity is locked to Laser 1. Laser 2 is the reference laser on the D2 line. Its output is
frequency shifted using the AOM before being fed into the cavity. The error signal between the

Abstract

∼

Collision cross sections and rate constants between two ground- state oxygen
molecules are investigated theoretically at translational energies below
1K
and in zero magnetic ﬁeld. We present calculations for elastic and spin- chang-
ing inelastic collision rates for diﬀerent isotopic combinations of oxygen atoms
as a prelude to understanding their collisional stability in ultracold magnetic
traps. A numerical analysis has been made in the framework of a rigid- rotor
model that accounts fully for the singlet, triplet, and quintet potential energy
surfaces in this system. The results oﬀer insights into the eﬀectiveness of evap-
orative cooling and the properties of molecular Bose- Einstein condensates, as
well as estimates of collisional lifetimes in magnetic traps. Speciﬁcally, 17O2
looks like a good candidate for ultracold studies, while 16O2 is unlikely to
survive evaporative cooling. Since 17O2 is representative of a wide class of
molecules that are paramagnetic in their ground state we conclude that many
molecules can be successfully magnetically trapped at ultralow temperatures.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Background

Following the enormous successes of lowering the temperature of atoms to the sub-mK
regime, experimental attention is now turning to producing ultracold molecular samples.
The “ﬁrst generation” of cold molecule experiments has now demonstrated the eﬃcient
production of cold samples by a variety of techniques, including photoassociation of ultracold
atoms [1], counter-rotating supersonic jets [2], Stark slowing [3], and buﬀer-gas cooling [4].
The latter two have yielded trapped samples that are cold in rotational, vibrational and
translational degrees of freedom, although translational temperatures are still in the 0.1-1
K range.

The next generation of experiments will seek colder, denser samples. One novel option for
cooling molecules further is the optical cooling strategy described in Ref. [5]. Alternatively,
we consider in this paper the evaporative cooling of paramagnetic molecules in a static
magnetic trap, following the strategies that have been employed to produce ultracold atoms.
The central issue to the success of this method is that the rate of elastic, rethermalizing
collisions far exceeds the rate of lossy inelastic collisions that produce untrapped, strong-
ﬁeld-seeking states. In terms of scattering rate coeﬃcients, this criterion is usually written
Kel > 102Kloss. A large ratio of Kel/Kloss is also vital for the stability of the trapped gas
once it is cold. A main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that molecules with nonzero
spin in their lowest energy state will be quite stable at ultralow temperatures.

We may reasonably assert that the elastic rate constants for neutral molecules have
10−10 cm3/sec at
roughly the same magnitudes as those for neutral atoms, Kel ∼
low energies, barring unfortunately placed zeros in their s-wave scattering cross sections.
Indeed, our calculations yield elastic rates of this magnitude. The spin- state- changing
rate constants are, however, completely unknown for molecules at ultralow temperatures.
To rectify this situation the present paper presents pilot calculations for cold collisions of
molecular oxygen. This work is a logical next step following Refs. [6,7], which considered
the interaction of molecular oxygen a the helium buﬀer gas.

Spin- state- changing cold collisions of O2 molecules are driven by at least three distinct
physical processes, two of which are already familiar from ultracold atom physics: i) Spin-
exchange collisions, which typically lead to unacceptably large loss rates for both atoms and
molecules; ii) Spin-spin magnetic dipolar interactions, which are typically small in either
case; and iii) Spin-rotation interactions, unique to molecules, wherein electronic spins are
inﬂuenced by their coupling to rotational motion, which is in turn dependent on torques
exerted by the anisotropic potential energy surface(PES) between the molecules.

Spin-exchange collisions can be avoided in cold molecule collisions, as in cold atom col-
lisions, by preparing the molecules in their “stretched” states, with mechanical rotation,
electronic spin, and nuclear spin (if any) all aligned along a common laboratory-ﬁxed axis.
We will therefore conﬁne ourselves to this circumstance. By far the leading contribution
to the rate constant for state- changing, lossy collisions (Kloss) is then the spin-rotation
coupling, as shown below in detailed calculations. Indeed, when an exothermic exit channel
is available, this coupling can yield loss rates comparable in magnitude to spin-exchange
rates, i.e., comparable to elastic collision rates. This is the case for the 16O2 molecule. The

2

spin- changing rate is, however, strongly suppressed when the only allowed exit channels are
degenerate in energy with the incident channel and when the collision energy lies below a
characteristic energy E0. In the stretched state of 17O2 this is indeed the case, since chang-
ing the molecular spin at low energy requires boosting the partial- wave angular momentum
from l = 0 to l = 2. These collisions are therefore suppressed by the Wigner threshold law
when E < E0, where E0 is the height of the l = 2 centrifugal barrier. For 17O2 the barrier is
0.013 K, not far below the temperature that buﬀer-gas cooling can take these
roughly E0 ∼
molecules.

The potential for disaster in molecule cold collisions is far greater than in atom cold col-
lisions. For example, hyperﬁne interactions are more complex, and include rotation-nuclear
spin couplings that can invert spins. These are, however, expected to have minimal impact
on the stretched-state molecules. Also of potential signiﬁcance are spin-vibration couplings,
which we disregard in O2 owing to the extremely large vibrational excitation energy of
ground state O2 molecules compared to the energy available to excite them. The vibrational
degrees of freedom remain to be fully explored at ultralow temperatures, but it is expected
that vibrational quenching (also an exothermic process) can occur with appreciable rates [8].
Finally, polar molecules are susceptible to particularly strong long-range anisotropies. While
this is not of direct relevance to molecular oxygen, it can be devastating to the electrostatic
trapping of polar molecules [9], and potentially dangerous for magnetically trapped molecules
when the electric and molecular dipole moments are coupled.

B. Oxygen molecules- General considerations

The importance of molecular oxygen as a potential candidate for cooling and trapping
experiments has been emphasized elsewhere [6,10]. We will here consider O2 molecules
that have been cooled to temperatures below 1K. We will furthermore assume that these
molecules have relaxed to their electronic 3Σ−
g ground state, and v = 0 vibrational ground
state. What remain are the rotational and spin degrees of freedom that inﬂuence evaporative
cooling. In a typical magnetostatic trap the molecules can be conﬁned provided that they
are in a weak-ﬁeld-seeking state, i.e., a state whose energy rises with magnetic ﬁeld.

The Zeeman diagram of O2 is reproduced in Figure 1. Nuclear exchange symmetry
declares that homonuclear oxygen isotopomers can have only even or only odd values of the
nuclear rotation quantum number N [12]. For 16O2 (or 18O2), which has identical spin-zero
nuclei, only odd values of N are allowed. For the isotopomer 17O2, where each nucleus has
spin IN = 5/2, the allowed N levels depend on the total nuclear spin ~I = ~IN A + ~IN B. The
molecules must have even values of N for odd values of I, and vice-versa. Thus the lowest
for 16O2 or 18O2, and
energy weak-ﬁeld seeking states are
N, JMJ i
Figure 1 illustrates the essential diﬀerence between the even-N and odd-N manifolds in
O2, from the standpoint of inelastic collisions. Namely, the trapped states with J = 2 in the
N = 1 manifold can decay exothermically to the untrapped J = 0 states. By contrast, the
N = 0 trapped state at low energy and low magnetic ﬁeld can only change its spin projection
MJ to other states that are nearly degenerate in energy. This diﬀerence proves crucial in
strongly suppressing spin-rotation collisions in 17O2 relative to 16O2. This has already been
discussed for cold collisions of O2 with helium atoms [6,7]; the situation is similar when

for 17O2. These states are indicated by heavy lines in the ﬁgure.

the molecules collide with each other. As in Refs. [6,7], we carry out calculations in zero
magnetic ﬁeld.

In this paper we ignore the role of nuclear spin, hence of hyperﬁne structure, in the 17O2
isotopomer. This is justiﬁed by considering the molecules to be in their stretched states of
N = 0, with MJ = J = 1 and MI = I = 5. The nuclear spin degrees of freedom are then
frozen out. In principle the weak nuclear spin-rotation coupling would inﬂuence the nuclear
spins, resulting in F = 6
F = 5, 4 transitions, but these couplings are an order- of-
magnitude smaller than the spin- rotation couplings we are already considering. Moreover,
measurements of the 17O2 microwave spectrum [11] reveal that its hyperﬁne structure is
inverted in its N = 0 state, requiring that 3.7mK of kinetic energy be supplied to change F .
Thus at ultralow temperatures hyperﬁne- state- changing collisions are rigorously forbidden.

II. MODEL

A. Hamiltonian

Our investigation of molecular collisions follows the model of diatom-diatom scattering
originally due to [13,14], but modiﬁed to incorporate the electronic spin of oxygen molecules.
The O2(3Σ−
g ) dimer has a spin-dependent intermolecular potential, namely three
g )
potential surfaces exist corresponding to singlet(S = 0), triplet(S = 1), and quintet (S = 2)
states of total electronic spin S [15]. The complete Hamiltonian for the collision process can
be written

O2(3Σ−

−

H = TA + TB + Vs + Vlr + Vdd + Hrf s,

(1)

where Ti is the translational kinetic energy of molecule i; Vs is the short-range exchange
interaction; Vlr is the long-range potential consisting of dispersion and electric quadrupole-
quadrupole interactions; Vdd is the electronic spin-spin dipolar interaction; and Hrf s is the
Hamiltonian for the rotational ﬁne structure of the two separate oxygen molecules. The
hyperﬁne interaction will be disregarded for now, as was discussed above. The short-range
potential can be written as a mean interaction plus exchange corrections, following Ref. [16]:

The connection between our coeﬃcients dLA,LB,MA,MB and coeﬃcients from [17] is in Ap-
pendix A. Figure 2 shows a slice through the potential energy surface for the singlet states
of the [O2(3Σ−
g )]2 dimer for the “H”-geometry of the two molecules, which passes through
the global minimum of the PES. Also shown are contributions to this potential from various
components with diﬀerent (L, LA, LB). We can see that this potential has a very strong
anisotropy. Notice that the isotropic contribution, with LA = LB = L = 0 accounts for less
than half of the total well depth.

As in the case of ultracold atoms, details of ultracold molecular collisions depend ex-
tremely sensitively on details of PES. Thus eventually the PES must be ﬁne- tuned using
key experimental data to provide complete quantitative results [18,19]. Nevertheless, the
order-of- magnitude of the rate constants, and their general trends, already emerge clearly
in the present model.

where R

to be a fairly weak contribution to spin-changing collisions, a conclusion that we ﬁnd holds
for molecules as well. Finally, in our model we take into account the molecular ﬁne structure,
which arises from the molecular rotation and spin-rotation coupling and is diagonal in our
total-spin basis at large R. For 16O2 we use the ﬁne- structure constants determined in [20],
and for 17O2 we employ those determined in [21].

We express the Hamiltonian in a basis of total angular momentum,

Figure 3 shows a partial set of adiabatic potential curves for 16O2 in the case of

= 0.
To generate this ﬁgure we include rotational channels N = 1, 3, 5 and even partial waves
l = 0
6, which already imply 100 channels in this case. The strong anisotropy in the PES
is here manifested mainly in a set of strongly avoided crossings near R = 8 a.u. For R > 8
a.u. the PES strongly favors a collinear conﬁguration of the pair of molecules, while for
R < 8 a.u. it strongly favors a parallel, “H”-shaped conﬁguration. This ﬁgure stresses the
importance of higher-lying rotational states in determining the details of scattering even at
ultracold energies. However, for 16O2 we have chosen to compute cross sections just for the
case l = 0

rates. Higher-lying channels will inﬂuence the details, but are unlikely to suppress losses.

This paper considers the scattering problem for the homonuclear species 16O2 and 17O2.

while it is probably impossible for 16O2.

partial waves that contribute to the cross section in the energy region up to 1K and how

waves are coupled together by the very anisotropic potential, but higher partial waves are

of the highest partial wave included. This Figure shows that it is enough to include just
l=0-4 partial waves for the qualitative description of the cross section in the region up to
1K. For
≈
all our calculations for 17O2 we considered just the two lowest rotational levels N = 0, 2.
Including only the N = 0 rotational level allows the molecules to explore only the isotropic
part of their PES. Thus N = 2 states must be included at least. The inﬂuence of higher
rotational levels are found to be small in test calculations, although they impact details of
the resonance structure. The calculations thus include 836 channels.

≈

Particularly striking in Figure 4 is the strong diﬀerence in the cross sections when lmax = 2
as opposed to lmax = 4, 6, 8, 10. This is caused by the strong anisotropy of the potential [15]
and mathematically this means that for the case lmax = 2 we take into account only a small
number of expansion functions (L, LA, LB) in (3). Although, these few functions represent
”most” of the potential, even small changes in potential can change the behavior of the
cross section dramatically near zero energy [19]. Figure 5 shows the elastic cross sections

the partial waves l = 8 and l = 10 contribute signiﬁcantly only above

0.5K.

Figure 5 also exhibits dozens of resonances for molecular- molecular collisions below 1K,
arising from the enormous number of internal molecular states [7]. Although we do not
assign quantum numbers to the resonant states here, we expect them to be of two basic
types, as discussed in [7]:
i) coupled- channel shape resonances; ii) ”rotational Feshbach”
resonances that change the value of N of one or more molecules. This last type of resonance
can be extremely long- lived, owing to the diﬃculty of both molecules returning to their

We have included the dipole- dipole interaction in these calculations. However the role
of this interaction is very small in general, inﬂuencing the cross section at the 1% level and
shifting resonance positions slightly. Likewise, this interaction is only a small perturbation
to inelastic scattering.

For the

0011, 11 > state of interest to trapping experiments,
Ni and Ji are conserved at low energy, since the next energetically available state (with
N = 2) is 11.18K higher in energy (Fig.1). Thus the only possible ﬁnal states are those
which diﬀer from the initial one in their projections MJ1 and MJ2. To accomplish such
a transition therefore requires that the angular momentum be carried away in the orbital
angular momentum l. Furthermore, the collisions that originate in s- wave channels will be
suppressed at energies below the centrifugal barrier of the d- wave exit channel. Using an
eﬀective C6 coeﬃcient, C ef f
from [17] this energy for a partial wave l can be approximated
as

The main aim of this paper, as previously discussed, is to compare the elastic and loss
rate constants. Figure 6a shows these rates calculated according to Eqn.(25). Away from
0.013K the loss rate constant is indeed strongly
resonances, in the energy range up to E0 ≈
suppressed. A detailed examination of the ﬁnal states contributing to this loss reveals general
17 O2 scattering. Namely, elastic scattering,
features which are the similar to those for He
which does not change either MJ1 or MJ2, is the most probable result of a collision. The
next most likely processes are those for which the ﬁnal MJ diﬀers from the initial one by 1
or 2 and the rates for these processes are smaller than the elastic rate by one -two orders
of magnitude. The processes for which the ﬁnal MJ diﬀers from the initial one by 3 or 4
have rates smaller than for elastic scattering by 2-4 order of magnitude. For energies above
0.013K inelastic processes become more probable, with rates only about 7- 10 times

−

≈
smaller than elastic rates.

The thermally averaged elastic and loss rates are relevant to the experimental situation.
If we assume the velocity distribution is Maxwellian characterized by a kinetic temperature
T we can calculate the thermally- averaged rate constant as:

To do this averaging we extrapolate the cross sections to energies > 1K using their values
at E = 1K.

Figure 6b shows these thermally averaged elastic and loss rates. For the cooling to
be eﬃcient the rate of elastic collisions Kel must exceed the rate of spin- changing, lossy
collisions Kloss by at least two orders of magnitude [25]. For 17O2, below T

condition is fullﬁlled. However, there is a ”relatively dangerous temperature range” above

It is a diﬀerent situation for 16O2 molecules from the point of view of comparing elastic
and inelastic cross sections. The general behavior of the elastic cross section for diﬀerent
channels is similar to that of 17O2 and has the same order of magnitude except in the energy
region near zero which is very sensitive to the details of the potential and the reduced mass.
With the present PES the 16O2 scattering length is 28a.u.

sections for the stretched states of 16O2 molecules that we are interested in have a smooth
structure in the energy region up to 1K, implying either a lack of resonances in this region or
their large widths. From Figure 7 we can see just one sharp Feshbach- type resonance near
0.8K belonging to an l = 10 bound state. Although there may be other weak resonances,

IV. CONCLUSION

|

In this article we theoretically investigated ground state diatom- diatom collisions in the
energy range up to 1K taking diﬀerent isotopomers of oxygen molecules as a prototype.
The main point of our investigation was to estimate the ratio of elastic and inelastic rate
constants. The inﬂuence of the rotational degrees of freedom is crucial in determining
In the case of the odd N- manifold, it is probably impossible to satisfy the
this ratio.
criterion Kel > 102Kloss for stretched states in any energy region, because of both the strong
anisotropy of the PES and the existence of the superelastic channels. In the case of the even
N- manifold, namely N = 0, this criterion can be fullﬁlled because for the stretched state
0011, 11 > there are no superelastic channels.

Even though the required ratio of Kel/Kloss is not quite met at buﬀer gas temperatures,
it is worth remembering that the buﬀer-gas procedure typically produces a far larger sample
of trapped molecules than do the laser cooling experiments on which evaporative cooling
is usually applied. Thus it is possible that a larger loss rate could be sustained without
harming the overall yield of molecules at ultralow temperatures. Detailed rate-equation
simulations of the cooling process are therefore required, an item to which we will turn our
attention in the future.

Equally importantly, once the molecules have in fact been cooled to µK temperatures,
out results imply that the lossy collision rates have diminished into insigniﬁcance, falling to
levels well below 10−14 cm3/sec. This in turn implies that ultracold spin-polarized 17O2 gases,
like their atomic counterparts, are experimentally stable and should allow the production of
novel Bose-Einstein condensates.

Beyond the immediate results for our particular model of 17O2, the present results have
broad implications for many paramagnetic molecular species. Namely, the characteristic
suppression of loss rates below the d-wave centrifugal barrier should be a generic feature for
molecules where no superelastic ﬁne-structure-changing processes exist. It is also important
to assess in detail the inﬂuence of the anisotropy of the PES. For this purpose further
investigations are necessary.

A long-standing problem to account for the electron-positron annihilation in positron Hydrogen scattering
above the Positronium formation threshold has been resolved by the use of the three-body Faddeev formalism.
The multichannel three-body theory for scattering states in presence of a complex absorbing potential is devel-
− annihilation amplitude, the amplitude of Positronium formation and
oped in order to compute the direct e+e
− direct annihilation cross sections and Positronium formation cross
respective cross sections. A number of e+e
sections in the energy gap between Ps(1s) and H(n = 2) thresholds are reported for both the positron-Hydrogen
incoming channel as well as the proton-Positronium incoming channel.

PACS numbers: 36.10.Dr, 34.90.+q

When colliding with the Hydrogen atom in the energy re-
gion between Positronium Ps(1s) and Hydrogen H(n = 2)
thresholds, the positron can annihilate in two possible chan-
nels either in the elastic e+−H one or in the rearrangement
p−Ps one. During rearrangement the positron captures the
electron from H and forms Positronium in the Ps(1s) state
and then the positron-electron pair annihilates from this state.
The lifetime of Ps(1s) is known to depend on the total spin
[1]. This well known annihilation mechanism is of the two-
body nature, i.e., once Positronium is formed the third par-
ticle does not affect the annihilation process. The annihila-
tion mechanism in the elastic e+−H channel is more compli-
cated and needs three-body footing. There was a number of
attempts for the uniﬁed three-body treatment of the positron
annihilation phenomenon and the Positronium formation, es-
pecially in the vicinity of the Positronium formation threshold
[2], [3], [4]. Nevertheless as to the best of our knowledge,
the self-consistent multichannel theory for the annihilation in
positron-atom collisions when the rearrangement channel is
open does not exist to date. It is the aim with this paper to ﬁll
out this gap by combining the three-body multichannel scat-
tering approach basing on modiﬁed Faddeev equations (MFE)
[5], [6] with the concept of a complex absorbing potential
[2] which allows to treat the annihilation in the framework of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In the paper we restrict
ourselves within the Ore gap energy region. The extension
onto the case when more than one Hydrogen (and Positron-
ium) state are participating is straightforward.

Let us recapitulate those portions of the one channel ap-
proach to the description of the annihilation phenomenon in
positron Hydrogen scattering below the rearrangement thresh-
old which are essential for a multichannel extension. The well
known QED formula [7], [8]

σa = πr2

0(c/v)Zeff

(1)

expresses the spin averaged annihilation cross section σa =
1/4 1σa + 3/4 3σa in terms of the effective number of elec-
trons Zeff contributing to the annihilation. The respective
number 2S+1Zeff for a spin state S is given by the integral

2S+1Zeff =

Z

dr1dr3 |2S+1Ψ0(r1, r3)|2δ(r1 − r3).

(2)

Throughout the paper we use bold letters for vectors, e.g.,
r, not bold ones for their magnitudes, e.g., r = |r|, and we
choose units such that ~ = 1. In formulae (1) and (2) the in-
gredients has the following meaning, r0 is the classical elec-
tron radius, c is the velocity of light, v is the incident veloc-
ity of positron, 2S+1Ψ0 is the e+−H scattering wave func-
tion when only Coulomb interaction is taken into account,
and r1 and r3 are position vectors of positron and electron
in the coordinate frame associated with proton. The presence
of the delta-function in (2) manifests the fact that e+ and e−
annihilate when they occupy the same position. The non-
relativistic quantum mechanical description consistent with
the above formulation can be based on the concept of a com-
plex absorbing potential [2], [3]. The use of this potential in
the Schr¨odinger equation leads to the particle loss. The cross
section associated with this loss is actually the annihilation
cross section. The absorbing potential is deﬁned by [3]
igW (r1 − r3) ≡ −i(e2/a0)(2S+1c)αS+3δ(r1 − r3),

(3)

where e is the electron charge, a0 is the Bohr radius, α is the
ﬁne structure constant, and spin dependent constants 2S+1c
are deﬁned as 1c = 2π and 3c = 8(π2 − 9)/9.

The Schr¨odinger equation for the positron Hydrogen wave

function with outgoing asymptotic boundary conditions

(E − H 0)Ψ+

p1 = igW Ψ+
p1,

where H 0 is the three-body Coulomb Hamiltonian and p1 is
the momentum of incident positron, can be rewritten as

In (5), ψ(r3) is the Hydrogen ground state wave function. The
elastic scattering amplitude Fe is entirely due to the Ψ0+
p1 con-
tribution, and the annihilation amplitude Fa is due to the ab-
sorbing potential. This amplitude is given by

Fa(p′

1, p1) =

where m is the electron mass. In principle, the annihilation
cross section σa can be computed from the total cross section
σt as

σa = σt −

dΩ |Fe|2, σt =

dΩ |Fe − igFa|2,

(7)

Z

but in the one channel case there is an alternative way which
is based on the optical theorem

σt =

ℑm[Fe(p1, p1) − igFa(p1, p1)],

from which the annihilation cross section appears as

σa = g

ℑm[−iFa(p1, p1)].

(8)

4π
p1

Now, the annihilation cross section (1) and the formula (2) for
the effective number Zeff follow immediately from (6) and (8)
with replacing Ψ+
p1 which, considering (4) per-
turbatively in view of |g| ≪ 1, is the ﬁrst order approximation
for Ψ+

p1 in (6) by Ψ0+

p1, i.e., Ψ+

p1 = Ψ0+

p1 + O(g).

Let us now turn to the case when the Positronium forma-
tion channel is open and thus the e+−H collision becomes
truly multi arrangemental. In this case the integral deﬁned by
(2) diverges and the cross section deﬁned by formula (1) is
inﬁnite. On the contrary, the exact amplitudes Fe and Fa de-
ﬁned by (5), (6) are ﬁnite (as long as the exact solution to ( 4)
is assumed) due to the effect of the absorbing potential which
makes the Positronium binding energy complex. Although the
exact amplitudes are well deﬁned, the matrix element (6) can-
not remedy the problem with the annihilation cross section.
Indeed, the contribution of elastic and rearrangement chan-
nels to the optical theorem for the three body system [9] is
additive

4π
p1

ℑm[Fe(p1, p1) − igFa(p1, p1)] = σ11 + σ21.

(9)

Here σ11 is the total (elastic plus annihilation) cross section
in the e+−H channel and σ21 is the total Positronium for-
mation (and annihilation after Positronium formation) cross
section. Since the contribution of the annihilation in the left
hand side of (9) is proportional to the matrix element (6) it is
apparent that with this quantity the direct annihilation process
and the process of the annihilation after Positronium forma-
tion are inseparable. We believe that a variant of this effect of
inseparability was observed in the numerical study of positron
Hydrogen scattering in [3], [10].

So, it is clear that the shortcoming of the outlined formalism
is due to an inadequate treatment of multichannel scattering.

2

The approach which is proven to deﬁne correctly the transi-
tion amplitudes between all open channels in the three-body
case is the Faddeev equation formalism [5] and its modiﬁca-
tion MFE for long-range interactions [6].
In this approach
the wave function is split into the sum of components each
of them corresponding to the given asymptotic arrangement.
The solution of the set of equations for components (Fad-
deev equations) satisﬁes the following requirements:
i) the
sum of components obeys the Schr¨odinger equation; ii) the
asymptotics of the component associated with a given asymp-
totic arrangement includes contributions from all open chan-
nels in this arrangement and coincides with the restriction of
the wave function on this arrangement [6]. This last property
guaranties that the amplitudes computed from components are
exact physical scattering amplitudes.

The three-body relative Jacobi coordinates xi and yi are
used to describe the conﬁguration of the three-body system in
the c.m. frame. So it is not required for proton to be inﬁnitely
heavy. The index i runs over all three arrangements of the sys-
tem and corresponds to the spectator particle i. The positron
Hydrogen Hamiltonian reads

H = T +

e2e3
x1

+

e3e1
x2

+

e1e2
x3

+ igW2(x2).

(10)

Here T is the c.m. kinetic energy, the index 1 corresponds
to the positron, whereas 2 and 3 do to proton and electron,
respectively, thus e1 = e2 = e, e3 = −e. The last term igW2
is the absorbing potential (3). For long-range potentials the
modiﬁcation [6] is needed, which consists in splitting of the
Coulomb potentials into long-range V l
i and short-range V s
i
pieces such that

i (xi, yi) + V s
V l

i (xi, yi) = V C

i (xi) ≡

(11)

ejek
xi

.

This splitting is made in the three-body conﬁguration space
by a smooth splitting function ζi(xi, yi) constructed in such
a way that ζi(xi, yi) = 1 if xi/x0 < (1 + yi/y0)ν and
ζi(xi, yi) = 0 if xi/x0 > (1+yi/y0)ν for some x0 > 0, y0 >
0 and 0 < ν < 1/2. With such a ζi the short- and long-range
parts of the Coulomb potentials are deﬁned as

i (xi, yi) = ζi(xi, yi)V C
V s

i (xi); V l

i = V C

The Hamiltonian (10) is transformed then into

H = H l + V s

1 + V s

2 + igW2; H l = T + V l

1 + V l

2 + V C

Faddeev components of the wave function Ψ+ are deﬁned by

The important feature of equations (12), with regard to de-
scription of the annihilation, is the fact that the two-body an-
nihilation potential igW2 is incorporated into equations in two
manners, i.e., in the diagonal part on the left hand side of the
equation (12) being responsible in the channel 2 for annihi-
lation of Positronium after its formation, and in the coupling
term on the right hand side supporting the annihilation process
in the positron Hydrogen channel 1 through the coupling.

The set of MFE (12) treats the multichannel nature of
the problem above the Positronium formation threshold cor-
rectly. Namely, in the asymptotic part of the channel 1 where
|y1| → ∞ and x1 is conﬁned within the Hydrogen atom vol-
ume, the only nonvanishing potentials are V l
1 in the
1 = V C
combination V l
1 and the ﬁrst MFE takes the form

1 and V s

1 + V s

(E − T − V C

1 )Ψ+

1 = 0.

So, it is obvious that asymptotically

Ψ+

1 (x1, y1) ∼ φ1(x1)eip1·y1,

where φ1(x1) is the Hydrogen wave function with the energy
ǫ1, so that E = p2
1/2ν1+ǫ1, and ν1 is the e+-H reduced mass.
In the asymptotic part of the channel 2, where |y2| → ∞
and x2 is conﬁned in the volume of the Positronium atom the
nonvanishing potential is V C
2 + igW2 and the second MFE is
reduced to

(E − T − V C

2 − igW2)Ψ+

2 = 0.

Hence, the asymptotics of the component Ψ+
as

2 can be written

Ψ+

2 (x2, y2) ∼ φ2(x2)eip2·y2, E = p2

2/2ν2 + ǫ2

where ν2 is the p-Ps reduced mass, φ2(x2) is the Positronium
wave function in presence of the absorbing potential, i.e., the
solution to the equation

The above arguments can be formalized rigorously with the
use of integral equations. To this end it is convenient to intro-
duce matrix notations

Thus, the MFE set takes the form

2 )T . The equation (14) can be rewritten

where Ψ = (Ψ+
as

Ψ = Ψ0 + ig[E+I − H(g) − V]

−1WΨ.

(15)

Here Ψ0 is the solution to the homogeneous equation

[EI − H(g) − V]Ψ0 = 0

(16)

which can be transformed to the integral form

Ψ0 = Φ + [E+I − H(g)]

−1VΨ0.

(17)

The driving term Φ obeys the homogeneous equation

[EI − H(g)]Φ = 0

and its components Φ = (Φ1, Φ2)T are given in terms of
channel functions φi(xi) by formulae

Φi(xi, yi) = φi(xi)eipi·yiδik

which deﬁne through the index k = 1, 2 of the Kronecker-
delta the initial state of the e+−H system.

From the analysis made in [5], [6] it follows that matrix in-
tegral equations (15) and (17) are well deﬁned and possess the
property that the driving term deﬁnes the solution uniquely.
So that, the asymptotics of the solutions of (15) and (17) is
entirely due to the asymptotics of the resolvent operators in-
corporated in the kernels of these equations. The latter asymp-
totics can be evaluated with the help of techniques developed
in [5], [6], [11] which leads to the following result for the so-
lution to (15) as yi → ∞

The ﬁrst term F 0
ik is entirely due to the contribution of Ψ0 in
(15) and if i = k then F 0
kk is the elastic scattering amplitude
whereas F 0
ik is the rearrangement amplitude if i 6= k. The
second term is due to the absorbing potential. The direct an-
nihilation amplitude in the e+−H channel F 1

formula

ergy should be taken on the lower rim to provide incoming
boundary conditions, so that E+ should be replaced by E− =
E − i0, and the inhomogeneous term is set as Φi(xi, yi) =
φi(xi)eipi·yiδi1. The amplitude F 1
2k has the structure similar
to that of (18). It plays the role of the correction term either
for the Positronium formation amplitude (k = 1) or for the
elastic amplitude of Positronium-proton scattering (k = 2).

Once amplitudes of all processes are determined, the cross

sections of interests are deﬁned by integrals

where σa
1k is the annihilation cross section. Formulae (19),
(20) were used for calculations of the direct annihilation cross
section σa
11 and the Positronium formation cross section σ21
for the e+−H incoming channel, and the direct annihilation
cross section σa
12 and the Hydrogen formation cross section
σ12 when p−Ps is the incoming channel. During the calcu-
lation we systematically used the smallness of the coupling
constant g of the absorbing potential to simplify amplitudes,
namely, from (15) it follows that Ψ = Ψ0 + O(g) and from
(17) it is immediately seen that Ψ0 = Ψ00 + O(g), where
Ψ00 is the solution to (17) when g = 0. Hence, the ampli-
tudes and cross sections in the leading order can be calculated
with the solution of MFE for the pure three-body Coulomb
problem.

11, σa

In tables below we list results of our calculations for σ12,
σ21 and σa
12 cross sections for total angular momenta
L = 0, L = 1 and L = 2 for ﬁve values of the energy of
the spectator in the Ore gap. All calculations were performed
on the base of a quintic spline algorithm for the solution of
differential MFE equations from [12]. The numerical error
for cross sections was estimated as not exceeding 5% for σa
11
and 10 % for σa

12.

As a concluding remark we want to emphasis that the MFE
formalism presented here is exact above the Positronium for-
mation threshold, at the same time it is equivalent to the stan-
dard one below the Positronium formation threshold [13] and
it is also exact for the Positronium ion Ps− [14].

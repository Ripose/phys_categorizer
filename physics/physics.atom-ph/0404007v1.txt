(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The Roothaan and Pople-Nesbet approaches for real atoms are adapted to quantum dots in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Single-particle Gaussian basis sets are constructed, for each dot
radius, under the condition of maximum overlap with the exact functions. The chemical potential,
the charging energy and the total spin expected values have been calculated, and we have veriﬁed
the validity of the quantum dot energy shell structure as well as the Hund rule for electronic
occupation at zero magnetic ﬁeld. For ﬁnite ﬁeld, we have observed the violation of Hund’s rule
and studied the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld on the closed and open energy shell conﬁgurations.
We have also compared the present results with those obtained with LS-coupling scheme for low
electronic occupation numbers. We focus only on ground state properties and consider quantum
dots populated up to 40 electrons, constructed by GaAs or InSb semiconductors.

INTRODUCTION

The inﬂuence of the spatial conﬁnement on the physical properties, such as electronic spectra of nanostructured
systems, is a topic of growing interest. Among the several kinds of conﬁned systems one can detach low dimensional
electronic gases and impurity atoms in metallic or semiconductor mesoscopic structures,1 as also atoms, ions and
molecules trapped in microscopic cavities,1,2,3,4,5 where the eﬀects of the conﬁnement become important when the
typical quantum sizes - such as Fermi wavelength - reach the same order of magnitude as the sizes of the cavities.
However, the energy spectrum of such systems is not only determined by the spatial conﬁnement and the geometric
shape, but also by environmental factors such as electric and magnetic ﬁelds. It is also deﬁned by many-body eﬀects
as electron-electron interaction, which may even become more important than the conﬁnement itself. In all cases, a
correct description of the physical properties of the problem requires the system wavefunction to reﬂect, in an appro-
priated way, the presence of both conﬁnement, internal and external interactions, and the corresponding boundary
conditions. We should also mention the existence of other conﬁned systems, for example, the ones constituted by
phonons,6 plasmons7 or conﬁned bosonic gases.8

Low dimensional electronic gases are deﬁned in semiconductor structures when the bulk translation symmetry is
broken in one or more spatial dimensions, giving origin to 2D (quantum wells), 1D (quantum wires) or 0D (quantum
dots) systems. In such structures, the charged carriers loose, for some interval of energy, the characteristic of being
delocalized in both three spatial dimensions and become conﬁned in regions of mesoscopic sizes inside the crystal.
This fact transforms the continua energy bands into broken subbands and energy-gaps, or even into fully discrete
energy states as for example in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which are the main type of conﬁned system to
be addressed in this work.

An important point to have in mind is that the usual charging model,9,10,11,12 which reduces the electron-electron
interaction inside the dot to a constant proportional to its electronic occupation, is able to reasonably reproduce the
experimental ﬁndings for metallic dots. However, in order to obtain a more realistic description of many-particle semi-
conductor dots, their relatively lower electronic density makes imperative to consider the electron-electron interaction
under a microscopic point of view. In strong conﬁnement regimes, it may even be included in a perturbative scheme.
Various are the approaches that have been used to deal with many-particle QDs. Among them, one can cite charging
model, correlated electron model,13 Green functions,14 Lanczos algorithm,15 Monte Carlo method,16 Hartree-Fock
calculations17,18,19,20 and density functional theory.21 It is useful to emphasize that not only the many-body eﬀects
but also the spatial symmetry (geometric conﬁnement) become indispensable ingredients for a precise determination
of quantum eﬀects in the electronic structure of semiconductor QDs.

Among the several kinds of geometries conﬁning a QD, maybe the most common be a two-dimensional one deﬁned
by a parabolic potential.22,23,24,25,26 Here we will consider a three-dimensional QD deﬁned by an inﬁnite spherical
potential. The former describes QDs lithographically deﬁned in the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas, while the
latter describes QDs grown inside glass matrices. Some of the commonly studied topics in 3D QDs are the formation
of energy shells in their spectra,27 the control of electronic correlations,28 the formation of Wigner molecules in the
system,29 and the inﬂuence of the Coulomb interaction in their spectra.30,31 In such spherically deﬁned 3D QD, both
spin and orbital angular momenta are good quantum numbers, and the many-particle eigenstates can be labelled

2

according to the usual LS-coupling scheme,32 where the exact analytic many-particle eigenstates are given as a sum
over appropriated Slater determinants. However, in order to deal with QDs having higher occupation, the LS-
coupling is no longer appropriated. Therefore, we have chosen to use in this paper the Roothaan and Pople-Nesbet
matrix formulations33 of the single determinant self-consistent Hartree-Fock formalism, respectively appropriated for
handling closed and open shell conﬁgurations. With them, we also calculate the QD addition spectrum and show how
a magnetic ﬁeld is able to violate the Hund rule. Here we consider a QD populated with up to N = 40 electrons under
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, and expand our basis in a set of properly optimized Gaussian functions. As a note
one could, in principle, also include spin-orbit coupling in the model, where L and S would then no longer be good
quantum numbers, but for an inﬁnite spherical potential such coupling yields no contribution to the total energy of
the system.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, for completeness and in order to introduce our notation, both
restricted and unrestricted formalisms are resumed. In section III we show the Hamiltonian model and discuss how
both QD chemical potential and charging energy are calculated; also, we present details on how the inclusion of a
magnetic ﬁeld changes the previous formalisms, as well as how the Gaussian basis set is constructed. Finally, in
section IV we show our results and we use section V to line up our conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

The Hartree-Fock (HF) approach assumes that the N -electron ground state of an interacting system is given by the

with m (ε) being the eﬀective electron mass (material dielectric constant), and ∇2 = r−2(∂/∂r(r2∂/∂r) − L2) being
the Laplacian. The symbol d4x is used in the integrals because the orbitals {χa} involve both spatial and spin parts.
The minimization of Eq. (1) yields the self-consistent integro-diﬀerential HF equation, whose procedure in order to
obtain the optimized spin orbitals can be found elsewhere;33 it is given by f |χai = εa |χai, where the Fock operator
is

f = ha +

[Jb − Kb] .

Xb
It can be straightly veriﬁed that the application of f on |χai can be obtained from Eq. (2). The ground state energy
E0 is calculated in each iteration of our code until a convergence of 10−9 eV be reached.

The above expressions are general in the sense that no supposition was taken on the spin orbitals {χa}. Furthermore,
the conﬁnement potential V (r) should be added to H, however, since we have chosen to work with an inﬁnite spherical
potential barrier, we have excluded it from our expressions.

A. Roothaan approach

The ﬁrst supposition, which is the core of the Restricted Hartree-Fock approach (RHF), consists in assuming that
both α (up) and β (down) spin functions are restricted to have the same spatial function or, more speciﬁcally, χi(x) =
ψj(r)α(ω), ψj(r)β(ω)
,
where a spatial function with (without) upper bar labels the spin-down (spin-up) state. Therefore, within the RHF

. In such way, the ground state of the system becomes

approach, the spatial orbitals {ψa|a = 1...N/2} are doubly occupied and
having total angular momenta J = L = S = 0. After integration over the spin degree of freedom,33 the HF equation
in the restricted formalism becomes f |ψai = εa |ψai, where the Fock operator is given by

Here, haa = hψa| ha |ψai, Jab = hψa| Jb |ψai, and Kab = hψa| Kb |ψai; so, the integrations in Eq. (2) involve only
spatial functions in the RHF approach.

The Roothaan formalism consists in translating the RHF equations into a matrix formulation. This is achieved by

expanding the set {ψi|i = 1...k} to be minimized, in a set of known basis functions {φν|ν = 1...k},

ν

where the spatial orbitals having k > N/2 are empty. Within this procedure, the coeﬃcients Cνi become the
parameters to be iterated. When Eq.

multiplied from the left by φ

µ(r), one obtains the Roothaan characteristic k x k matrix expression,

(6) is inserted in the closed shell HF equation (f given in Eq.

where S is the positive deﬁned overlap matrix between the basis functions, whose elements are

C is the matrix of the expansion coeﬃcients Cνi, whose columns describe each spatial orbital ψi, ε is the diagonal
matrix of the orbital energies εi, and F is the matrix of the Fock operator f , whose elements are

In order to explicitly write the Fock matrix, it is convenient to introduce the charge density of the system. For a
closed shell conﬁguration, described by a single determinant where each spatial orbital is doubly occupied, it can be

The self-consistency of this method appears as the dependence of F on P that, in turns, depends on C, which are the
parameters to be determined.

Therefore, the procedure for the solution of Eq. (7) must follow the steps: i) Given a conﬁnement potential for the

this one-electron matrix no longer changes, since it does not depend on P or C) to form F; v) F is diagonalized in
order to get C and ε, and the solution is used to form a new matrix P from Eq. (10); vi) This iteration is performed
until the desired convergence be found. The criterion for convergence may also be set in the change of the ground
state energy that is calculated in each iteration; in the Roothaan formalism it can be written as

The second supposition is based on the relaxation of Roothaan’s restriction by letting the α and β spin functions

but it has to satisfy the condition N = N α + N β, the sum of spin-up and spin-down electrons.

In analogy with the RHF case, the spin can be integrated in the UHF formalism.33 The main diﬀerence here is

The Pople-Nesbet formalism has analogy to the Roothaan one. The diﬀerence is that, instead of Eq. (6), there are
two distinct expansions for the spatial orbitals ψα and ψβ in terms of the known basis functions {φν|ν = 1...k}, given
by

By following the same procedure as in the Roothaan matrix expressions, one obtains the two characteristic k x k
coupled equations for the Pople-Nesbet approach,

Here the overlap matrix S is deﬁned in Eq. (8), and the meanings of Cα/β, εα/β, and Fα/β become understood from
the discussion following that equation. The respective Fock matrices are given by

It is also convenient in this UHF formalism for open shell systems to introduce the charge density of the up and down
ν P α/β

spin electrons, ρα/β(r) =

From these expressions one can deﬁne two new quantities. One is the total charge density, ρT (r) = ρα(r)+ρβ(r), which
yields the total number of carriers, N , after integrated over all space; the other is the spin density, ρS(r) = ρα(r)−ρβ(r),
whose integral over all space yields 2MS. The latter shows that unrestricted wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of SZ,
but not necessarily of S2. Consequently, one can deﬁne the total, PT , and spin, PS, density matrices for the system
as

Furthermore, the elements of the two Fock matrices can be obtained by inserting Eq. (14) into Eq. (18), and using
µν , where the kinetic matrix Tµν is deﬁned

µν = Tµν + Gα/β

Eqs. (16), (19) and (20). After some algebra, one ﬁnds F α/β
in Eq. (11), and the two Coulomb matrices Gα/β

Notice that the self-consistency again lies in the fact that both F matrices depend on the P matrices which, in turns,
depend on C matrices. Finally, the coupling between up and down spin equations appears on the property that Fα
(Fβ) depends on Pβ (Pα) through PT .

The procedure for the solution of Eq. (17) is the same used for Eq. (7), having in mind that now a simultaneous
solution must be found for the two distinct spatial orbital sets. If the criterion for convergence in the Pople-Nesbet

As an application of both RHF and UHF formalisms, we consider a QD with radius R0 conﬁned by an inﬁnite
spherical potential in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld B = B0(0, 0, 1) that can be populated up to 40 electrons. The
single-particle Hamiltonian has the form

all the angular part of the problem can be solved analytically and, after inserted into our numerical code, we are left
to solve only the radial degree of freedom.

Without magnetic ﬁeld, we take into account in Eqs. (6) and (16) the spatial orbitals that deﬁne the six lowest
energy shells (1s, 1p, 1d, 2s, 1f , 2p) under this symmetry.34 Therefore, the index ν ≡ n, l, ml can assume up to 40 (20
spin-up and 20 spin-down) possible values for the states within those shells. Certainly, the inclusion of a magnetic ﬁeld
lifts both spin and orbital degeneracies of those states. In our application, we shall consider two possible materials
forming the QD, namely GaAs (wide-gap material) and InSb (narrow-gap material), whose deﬁning parameters are
m = 0.065, g = 0.45 and ε = 12.65 for GaAs, and

m = 0.013, g = −53.1 and ε = 16.5 for InSb.

conﬁguration, thus yielding no contribution. However, all terms proportional to B0 have to be considered in the Pople-
Nesbet formalism, since we will be dealing with an open shell conﬁguration. Both linear (∼ B0LZ) and quadratic
(diamagnetic) terms can be straightly added to the deﬁnitions of haa (Eq. (2)) and Tµν (Eq. (11)). Moreover, the
inclusion of the spin-dependent linear term (∼ B0SZ) in haa will impose the kinetic matrix Tµν be decomposed in its
µν , as it occurs with Gα/β
components T α/β
in Eq. (21). Thus, under a magnetic ﬁeld, we must make in the ground

The last important detail in our approach refers to the orbital basis {φν|ν = 1...k} used in our calculations. Instead
of the spherical Bessel functions of Eq. (27), the radial part of each orbital is decomposed in a sum involving ﬁve
Gaussians conﬁned to a sphere of radius R0, while the angular part is maintained as deﬁned by its symmetry. So, we
change the basis in Eq. (27) by

and the polynomial in x makes the functions having l > 0 be zero at the origin x = 0; also, the product in (
makes the function be zero at the zeros
αil of the respective spherical Bessel function transposed to the interval
0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and the last sum involves an expansion in ﬁve Gaussians. For N ≤ 40, higher number of Gaussians in
the expansion does not show any improvement on our results. The coeﬃcients Vk as well as the exponents Dk are
determined for each value of R0, and are obtained by using the condition of maximizing the superposition between
Eq. (30) and the respective spherical Bessel function. Once Vk and Dk are determined and the basis is found, we run
our RHF (UHF) code for given values of R0 and N , and ﬁnd the parameters Cνi (Cα/β
) that better describe Eq. (6)
(Eq. (16)) and give the minimal energy in Eq. (13) (Eq. (22)).

Finally, we would like to calculate two closely related quantities that give interesting information on the charging
processes of a conﬁned system. The ﬁrst one is the QD chemical potential, µdot(N ), which yields the energy diﬀerence
between two successive ground states, and can be calculated as

µdot(N ) = E0(N ) − E0(N − 1).

The second one is the QD charging energy, Echar(N ), which yields the energy cost for the addition of an extra electron
to the system,

Echar(N ) = I(N ) − A(N ) = E0(N + 1) − 2E0(N ) + E0(N − 1).

Here, I(N ) = E0(N − 1) − E0(N ) is the ionization potential, while A(N ) = E0(N ) − E0(N + 1) is the electronic
aﬃnity. It becomes clear, from these two equations, that Echar(N ) = µdot(N + 1) − µdot(N ).

IV. RESULTS

Figure 1 shows a comparison between the exact orbitals described by the spherical Bessel functions of Eq. (27)
and the expansions involving the Gaussians of Eq. (30) used in our calculations for a GaAs QD having N = 2 and
R0 = 100 ˚A. The right panel shows the radial wavefunctions while the left one shows the radial probability densities.
Although one can observe a diﬀerence in the s-wavefunctions, near x = 0, their probability densities are reasonable
in that region. For any other occupation and radius, as also for InSb QDs, this same feature regarding s-orbitals is
observed. Table I shows the optimized coeﬃcients and exponents for the ﬁve Gaussians related to the six orbitals
taken into account. The factor 10−4 in all exponents cancels the term R2
0 in Eq. (30). Besides, all exponents related
to any orbital having n = 2 are negative since there are regions where those wavefunctions possess negative values.

In ﬁgure 2 we show results of a RHF-Roothaan calculation. In the left panel we present the ground state energy
as function of the radius for a GaAs QD populated with 2, 8 and 18 electrons, while the right one shows the same,
but for a InSb QD populated with 2, 34 and 40 electrons. These ﬁve distinct values, plus N = 20, are the successive
magic numbers for the closed shell conﬁgurations at this symmetry. In both QDs, it is noticed that the kinetic energy
is much higher and totally dominates the Coulomb one at smaller radii. Thus, the energies related to diﬀerent N
values are more distant from each other. At larger radii, or smaller electronic density, the electron-electron interaction
becomes more important and the energy separation decreases. In the insets, which show a zoom at larger radii, we
analyze the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the system shell conﬁguration. For both occupations N , the curves
for increasing energy ordering refer to ﬁelds of 0, 2, 5, 8 and 10 T, even though we have only labeled the cases with
N = 18 and N = 40. For N = 2 the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld is imperceptible at those inset scales. As also
expected, due to its large g-factor, the Zeeman splitting is much higher for the InSb QD (observe the diﬀerent energy
scales in the insets). Most interesting is the fact that even for a closed shell conﬁguration, where L = S = 0, the
inﬂuence of the quadratic ﬁeld (diamagnetic term) of Eq. (26, which is the only non-zero contribution in the restricted
case, becomes important mainly for higher occupation numbers and ﬁelds, as well as at larger radii (notice that there
are almost no diﬀerence between 0 and 2 T for any N ).

In order to study spectra for any occupation we show, in ﬁgure 3, the results of a UHF-Pople-Nesbet calculation for
a GaAs QD having R0 = 100 ˚A and without magnetic ﬁeld. In the left upper panel it is made a comparison between
the UHF results and the non-interacting electron case, where the energy shell structure is clear for N = 2, 8, 18, 20,
34 and 40. Notice that the electron-electron interaction makes the energy of a QD, whose occupation corresponds
to a shell less (more) than half-ﬁlled, be decreased (increased) with respect to the non-interacting case. When such
occupation corresponds exactly to half-ﬁlled cases (N = 5, 13, 27 and 37), the interacting energy is approximately
equal to the non-interacting one.

In the left bottom panel of ﬁgure 3 we show both QD chemical potential (left scale, Eq. (31)) and charging energy
(right scale, Eq. (32)), where the respective values of E0 are obtained from the unrestricted calculation presented in
the left upper panel. Notice that µdot increases linearly as the occupation gets higher inside a given shell. When such
shell is totally ﬁlled, there is an abrupt change in µdot indicating that the following shell starts its occupation; observe
that the higher the occupation, the larger is the changing. An anomalous behavior seems to occur for the 2s shell,
whose µdot value is larger than the one for the 1f shell (that has higher energy). The charging energy is another way
to verify not only the presence of shell structure for the spectrum, but also the validity of Hund’s rule for the ﬁlling of
such shells. In principle, Echar must present larger (smaller) peaks when the total (half) occupation of a given shell
is achieved; the ﬁrst fact is due to the higher diﬃculty to the addition of an extra electron to a QD when a ﬁlled shell
state is reached. The second one refers to Hund’s rule, which establishes that electrons must be added to the system
with their spins being parallel, until all possible orbitals inside a given shell be occupied; this makes the total energy
of the system smaller since this procedure maximizes the negative exchange contribution. However, some violations

FIG. 2: Restricted ground state energies for a GaAs (left panel) and InSb (right panel) QD populated with N = 2, 8 and
18 (N = 2, 34 and 40) electrons. The Coulomb contribution is more important at larger radii. In the insets we analyze the
inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld in the system, where one can see that even in a closed shell conﬁguration having L = S = 0, the
presence of the ﬁeld is visible due to the diamagnetic term.

of this rule can be veriﬁed in Echar: the smaller peak of N = 27 occurs here at N = 26, and the larger peak of N = 20
has a negative value.

The bottom and upper right panels of ﬁgure 3 show respectively the evolution of the total spin S and its projection
MS as a function of QD population, calculated from Eqs. (23) and (24) for the unrestricted energies. Notice that,
without magnetic ﬁeld, the Hund rule seems to be followed for all states with up to 40 electrons. The MS expected
value oscillates from 0 in a ﬁlled shell to its maximum in a half-ﬁlled shell, when it starts to decrease again on the
way to the closing of the shell; the maxima are MS = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 and 7/2 for s, p, d and f shells, respectively.
The S expected value yielded by the unrestricted formalism is also very reasonable; discrepancies are only observed
at N = 24, where S > 2, and at N = 21, where S > 1/2. We believe that both discrepancies related to the 2s shell
or to its surroundings - µdot larger than the one of 1f shell, negative peak for N = 20 in Echar, and almost doubled
S expected value for N = 21 - are caused by the non-reasonable Gaussian reproduction of this orbital, as visible in
ﬁgure 1. These same qualitative results are observed for an InSb QD without magnetic ﬁeld.

By focusing on the 1p shell we show in ﬁgure 4, for the same QD of the previous ﬁgure, how a ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld
is able to violate Hund’s rule in the system. Panels from left to right and from up to bottom show the successive
ground state energies from N = 3 to N = 8 as this shell is ﬁlled, always considering that the 1s shell remain fully
occupied by two electrons, one spin-up and one spin-down; the distinct possible spin conﬁgurations for each N are
indicated by + (spin-up) and − (spin-down). In addition to the small Zeeman eﬀect present in all occupations, there
is a change of ground state spins at N = 4, 5 and 6 as the ﬁeld is increased. Notice that at zero ﬁeld the spin sequence
is 1/2 − 1 − 3/2 − 1 − 1/2 − 0; in a ﬁeld above 3 T it becomes 1/2 − 0 − 1/2 − 0 − 1/2 − 0, meaning that quartets
and triplets are suppressed by the magnetic ﬁeld, and the ground state of the system starts to oscillate only between
singlets and doublets at high ﬁelds as N increases. When this 1p shell is half-ﬁlled (N = 5), the ground state goes

FIG. 3: Unrestricted ground state energies for a R0 = 100 ˚A GaAs QD without magnetic ﬁeld. In the upper left panel we
compare the unrestricted and the non-interacting energies, where the QD energy shell structure is visible. The bottom left
panel shows QD chemical potential (left scale) and charging energy (right scale); the former displays abrupt change always that
a new shell starts to be populated, while the latter presents larger (smaller) peaks when a shell is ﬁlled (half-ﬁlled), a direct
consequence of the Hund rule. The bottom and upper right panels show, respectively, the N -evolution of the expected values
of total spin S and its projection MS.

from a quartet to a doublet at B0 ≃ 2 T; when it has one electron more (N = 6) or less (N = 4) than that, it goes
from a triplet to a singlet at B0 ≃ 3 T.

At last, we have compared the results from both RHF and UHF self-consistent matrix formulations with the ones
obtained from the LS-coupling scheme used in Ref. [35], where a GaAs QD having R0 = 90 ˚A was considered, and
the quadratic term in B0 was neglected since only small magnetic ﬁelds were considered. Also, only N = 2 and N = 3
occupations were calculated, since the states were constructed analytically (not only a single Slater determinant), and
the electron-electron interaction was included by using perturbation theory, that is justiﬁed at such radius. At zero
ﬁeld the energies for N = 2 are 16.5 meV (LS) and 16.1 meV (RHF), while for N = 3 they are 34.8 meV (LS) and
33.9 meV (UHF). Therefore, both Roothaan and Pople-Nesbet formalisms indeed give smaller ground state energies
than the LS perturbative scheme. We have also checked the validity of neglecting the diamagnetic term (quadratic in
B0) for ﬁelds smaller than 2 T. We may emphasize here that a disadvantage of the UHF approach is, in principle, that
one is never sure to get trustable information about the expected values for L and S in a given QD state. On the other
hand, the applicability of the LS scheme is cumbersome and becomes very complicated to be handled analytically as
the QD occupation increases.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown how the mean-ﬁeld Roothaan and Pople-Nesbet formalisms applied to a spherical quantum dot
conﬁned system under applied magnetic ﬁeld yield a fairly good description of its energy shell structure. For a
maximum population of 40 electrons considered, the appropriated Gaussian basis set for each radius has been found.
We have seen how a magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuences the total energy of ground states even in closed shell conﬁgurations. We
have also shown how both chemical potential and charging energy reproduce the closing and half-closing structures
of the quantum dot energy shells. With the calculation of the total spin expected value for each occupation, in a

FIG. 4: Violation of Hund’s rule induced by magnetic ﬁeld in the R0 = 100 ˚A GaAs QD of the previous ﬁgure. The panels
show the successive occupation (indicated in the upper right corner of each panel) of the 1p shell, assuming that the 1s shell
remains populated by one spin-up and one spin-down electron. The possible spin conﬁgurations for given N are indicated by
+ (spin-up) and − (spin-down). For B0 = 0 the spin sequence is 1/2 − 1 − 3/2 − 1 − 1/2 − 0, while at ﬁelds higher than 3 T it
changes to 1/2 − 0 − 1/2 − 0 − 1/2 − 0. It is interesting to observe that a magnetic ﬁeld is able to suppress the energy triplets
and quartets of p-shells from the QD spectrum.

given radius, we have observed that Hund’s rule is satisﬁed at zero ﬁeld. However, under ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld, we
have shown that its applicability is violated and, at given values of the ﬁeld, which depend on quantum dot radius
and material parameters, there are transitions that change a given ground state symmetry.

We have measured the index of refraction for sodium de Broglie waves in gases of Ar, Kr, Xe,
and N2 over a wide range of sodium velocities. We observe glory oscillations—a velocity-dependent
oscillation in the forward scattering amplitude. An atom interferometer was used to observe glory
oscillations in the phase shift caused by the collision, which are larger than glory oscillations observed
in the cross section. The glory oscillations depend sensitively on the shape of the interatomic
potential, allowing us to discriminate among various predictions for these potentials, none of which
completely agrees with our measurements.

A singularity in the classical diﬀerential scattering
db |−1 arises when θ(bglory) = 0 or
cross section dσ
π at ﬁnite non-zero impact parameter, bglory. This was
named glory scattering by B. Cellini who observed the re-
sulting circle of back-scattered light around the shadow
of his head on the dewy grass. An even brighter glory can
be observed surrounding the shadow of one’s airplane on
the clouds of spherical water droplets below [1].

Glory scattering is not just an optical phenomenon. In-
teratomic potentials are attractive at long range but have
repulsive cores. Hence there is an impact parameter just
beyond the potential minimum for which θ(bglory) = 0.
Quantum mechanics demands that atom-atom scatter-
ing be treated as a wave phenomenon, but when the
de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the poten-
tial, the semiclassical approximation can be used [2] in
which the incident wave is viewed as traveling along clas-
sical paths. There are then two possible paths to scatter
into the forward direction—a long range diﬀractive com-
ponent from large b, and the aforementioned path near
the potential minimum. Waves from these paths con-
tribute to the scattering amplitude in the forward direc-
tion, f (k, θ = 0), for which the partial wave treatment
reads:

f (k, 0) =

where the sums are both real.

The behaviors of the real and imaginary parts of f (k, 0)
are diﬀerent. Imf (the second sum in Eq. 1) has a large
value owing to the fact that sin2 δ averages to 1
2 where
the scattering is strong (δ ≫ π). The contributions from
large l and lglory add on top of this large value, making
Imf less sensitive to the shape of the potential. On the
other hand, the strong scattering region contributes zero
on average to Ref , and the long range and glory contri-
butions can either add or subtract, making it easier to
discern eﬀects from each region as well as their relative
phase.

The ratio,

ρ(k) ≡

Ref (k, 0)
Imf (k, 0)

,

(2)

has been shown to give information about the rate of
increase of the interatomic potential V (r) for large r in-
dependently of the strength of V (r) [3]. Also, oscilla-
tions in ρ depend sensitively on the potential near the
well bottom. This sensitivity has motivated several the-
oretical predictions for ρ based on possible interatomic
potentials [4, 5, 6, 7].

We have measured ρ(k) in an atom interferometer us-
ing a technique that parallels out previous measurement
at ﬁxed k [3, 8]. ρ is found by measuring Ref , which
is related to the phase shift caused by the collision, as
well as Imf , which is related via the optical theorem
to the absorption cross section [9]. An atom interfer-
ometer determines the phase shift and attenuation of
the de Broglie wave in one arm of the interferometer
that passes through a “target gas” by interfering with
the other arm which does not. Speciﬁcally, propagation
through a gas of length L modiﬁes the wavefunction by
a factor exp[i(n − 1)klabL] where n is the complex index
of refraction, n = 1 + 2πndf (k, 0)/klabk, with nd the tar-
get gas density and k and klab the Na wavevectors in the
center-of-mass and lab frames.

The interferometer is composed of three nanofabri-
cated diﬀraction gratings forming a Mach-Zehnder ge-
ometry [10]. A gas cell exposes one path of the interfer-
ometer to a gas while leaving the other path undisturbed
(Fig. 1). A beam velocity of 0.7–3.0 km/s (with ∼5% rms
spread) is chosen by changing the carrier gas mixture in
the supersonic oven. The velocity is measured to ±30
m/s from the atom diﬀraction pattern of a grating.

Several apparatus improvements were necessary in or-
der to study the velocity-dependent index of refrac-
tion. New 100 nm period gratings [11] double the path
separation—and hence the maximum usable velocity in
the interferometer—compared to the old 200 nm grat-
ings [12]. These gratings, developed by Tim Savas and

Schematic of the atom interferometer and the gas

Hank Smith, have already lead to a number of advances
in atomic and molecular physics [13].

A thinner gas cell wall [14] also allows the atom paths
to be closer together and hence allows higher velocities.
The wall of the gas cell is a 10 µm thick Si wafer which
is anodically bonded to a glass substrate. Channels cut
into the glass create the volume of the cell and allow the
beam to enter and exit (Fig. 1).

The gas cell can be ﬁlled and emptied with a time
constant of 1–2 sec (∼10 times faster than before) us-
ing computer-controlled valves and wider supply lines.
Faster cycle times reduce errors due to phase drift caused
by thermal and mechanical motion of the gratings. This
drift has been further reduced by mounting the inter-
ferometer on a rigid optical breadboard suspended by a
vibration isolation system inside of the vacuum chamber.
ρ is measured by comparing the interference pattern
with and without gas in the cell. In the absence of gas,
we observe an interference pattern in the detected signal
I0 that depends on the position x of one of the gratings,

I0(x) = N0 + A0 cos(φ0 + kgx),

(3)

where N0 is the average detected ﬂux of atoms (ranging
from 5–100 kHz depending on beam velocity), A0 is the
amplitude of the interference pattern (typically 5–20% of
N0), and kg is the grating wavevector. φ0, the phase of
the interference pattern in the absence of gas, is found by
a ﬁt to I0(x) which also determines N0 and A0. When the
cell is ﬁlled with gas, the interference pattern becomes

Igas(x) = Ngas + Agas cos(φgas + kgx)

(4)

from which ρ can be determined [8]:

ρ =

φgas − φ0
ln Agas − ln A0

(5)

A feature of this experimental method is that the
measurements of attenuation and phase shift are rela-
tive measurements, eliminating problems due to intensity

2

ﬂuctuations and phase drift. Furthermore, measuring the
ratio of attenuation vs phase eliminates the dependence
on the target gas pressure (which may ﬂuctuate), and
obviates the need to know it absolutely. It also cancels
out the v−2/5 dependence of cross section and phase shift
that can obscure the glory oscillations in f .

In Fig. 2, ρ(v) is plotted as a function of Na beam ve-
locity v for target gases of Ar, Kr, Xe, and N2. Each data
point represents an average of 1–3 hours of data taken at
one to three diﬀerent pressures at a single beam velocity
on a single night. Our previous index of refraction mea-
surement [8] taken at a beam velocity of 1 km/s is shown
for comparison.

The improvements to the experimental apparatus men-
tioned above have allowed us to acquire the large range
of data in Fig. 2 with smaller statistical error than our
previous measurements. We have also been more care-
ful to consider possible systematic errors, correcting for
these eﬀects where feasible.

The biggest source of systematic uncertainty is inter-
ference from unwanted paths that reach the detector—
for instance, the two paths that form the mirror image of
the interferometer shown in Fig. 1, or from paths of Na2
molecules composing 25% of the intensity of the beam
[22]. To avoid molecule interference, we deliberately mis-
align the gas cell wall at low velocities so that it appears
wider than the Na2 path separation. The 50 µm-wide
detector is positioned to avoid the other orders, but be-
cause of beam alignment error and thermal drift, there
is occasionally some detection of the wrong interference
pattern, contributing as much as 5% to the interfering
amplitude, A0, except at higher velocities where it can
be 50%. The resulting error in ρ is typically +3/−0%
but as much as +20/−0% at the highest velocities of
both the 100 and 200 nm data. This accounts for the
asymmetrical systematic error bars in Fig 2.

Another systematic eﬀect is the attenuation of the path
outside the gas cell due to gas leaking from the ends of the
cell. The integrated density of gas along the path inside
the cell relative to the path outside is 120 ± 20 which
results in a +1.7(0.3)% correction to the measured ρ.

Another source of error arises from measuring the in-
terference pattern while the gas cell pressure hasn’t fully
equilibrated after ﬁlling or evacuating. We do this to
reduce the cycle time to ∼20 sec leaving only 3 sec of
dead time for ﬁlling or emptying. The resulting error in
ﬁtting to the time-averaged interference pattern, up to
0.5% uncertainty in ρ, is included in the systematic error
bars.

Contaminants in the target gas must also be avoided.
One such contaminant caused a 3% uncertainty in ρ for
the 200 nm Ar data before it was ﬁxed.

Error bars on the new data points in Fig. 2 include
the sum of statistical and systematic errors. Because the
only non-negligible systematic comes from beam align-
ment and drift, we have an independent check of this

error by examining the repeatability of data taken on
diﬀerent nights. We expect that the error in alignment
or drift may exceed our estimates on some nights, but
this can be recognized: ρ will be artiﬁcially low com-
pared to other nights, we will see this deviation in all the
gases measured, and the measurement will have larger
statistical error bars as the ratio changes due to drift.
An example of these features can be seen in the severely
outlying data points measured at 1450 m/s for Kr, Xe,
and N2.

Another check of systematics can be made by compar-
ing the 100 and 200 nm data where they overlap. At this
velocity, unwanted interference is seven times larger for
the 200 nm data than for the 100 nm data, yet the agree-
ment between the two is well within the error estimates.
The data are also consistent with older measurements
taken at v = 1 km/s [8], with the exception of Xe, which
disagrees dramatically. However, no care was taken in
that experiment to consider systematic errors, which we
estimate were +30/−10% in ρ due to the unwanted in-
terference of Na2 molecules and could have been worse
for this particular measurement if thermal drift was ex-
cessive.

To compare our measurements with a prediction for
V (r), the sum in Eq. (1) must be computed. The Na
wavelength is much smaller than the range of the in-
teratomic potentials we are considering, so hundreds of
partial waves contribute to the sum and we are justiﬁed
in replacing it with an integral:

Ref (k) = k

b sin 2δ(b) db

(6a)

Imf (k) = k

2b sin2 δ(b) db

(6b)

where b ≡ (l + 1

2 )/k is the classical impact parameter.

Because the kinetic energy is much greater than the
well depth of the interatomic potential, we can ﬁnd δ(b)
using the Eikonal approximation—that δ is the accumu-
lated phase shift of the atom traveling at constant speed
along a straight-line path with impact parameter b:

where µ is the reduced mass. Predictions using this ap-
proach are valid to 6% in ρ for the Na-Ar system and 3%
for the Na-Kr and Na-Xe systems in comparison to an ex-
act quantum treatment [23]. Predictions for ρ must also
average over the room-temperature distribution of target
gas velocities in our experiment, which damps the glory
oscillations somewhat at lower beam velocities [6, 7].

Fig. 2 also shows calculations of ρ(v) based on pre-
dictions of V (r) for Na-Ar [7, 15, 16, 17, 18], Na-Kr
[15, 19], and Na-Xe [19, 20, 21] derived from spectro-
scopic measurements and beam scattering experiments.

The oscillations in these curves are glory oscillations, and
are evident in the data. Even after allowing for statisti-
cal and systematic errors, our data disagree with these
predictions. We believe this is because our measurements
are very sensitive to the shape of the potential near the
minimum (see examples in [24]), where the transition
from the repulsive core to the Van der Waals potential is
poorly understood, even though the well depth and loca-
tion of the minimum are fairly well known. The N2 data
are remarkable as well for showing a large variation in ρ
without any evidence of an oscillation, unfortunately, the
potential is not understood in enough detail to explain
this behavior [25, 26].

Because there is good agreement on the location and
depth of the potential minima, we can use this knowledge
to scale our measurements of ρ in a way that is sensitive
to the shapes of all three Na-rare-gas potentials, inde-
pendent of the well location and depth. We can write
any potential as V (r) = Deg(r/re) where De and re are
the depth and location of the minimum and g(x) is a
dimensionless function with a minimum g(1) ≡ −1. In
the Eikonal approximation ρ depends only on g(x) and
the dimensionless parameter α ≡ Dere/~v. α is approxi-
mately the phase shift in radians accumulated along the
glory path. Changing the well depth or location of a po-
tential without changing its shape g(x) is equivalent to
changing the velocity scaling of ρ(v).

In Fig. 3 we have plotted measurements of ρ for Ar,
Kr, and Xe verses the dimensionless parameter α, using
values of De and re taken from [6]. Because of thermal
averaging, the values of ρ we measure also depend weakly
on the ratio of v to the mean speed of the scatterer, but
diﬀerences in ρ(α) due to thermal averaging would be at
most of 5%. Also included are data for Ne, with new sys-
tematic error estimates, which were taken with the older
apparatus [5, 8]. Plotted in this manner, the combined
data clearly show a full glory oscillation, as well as a hint
of a second. For comparison we show ρ as derived from
the Lennard-Jones potential, g(x) = x−12 − 2x−6, and
the Morse potential g(x) = e−2β(x−1) − 2e−β(x−1) using
β = 4.7 which is appropriate for the Na-Ar system [7].
The continuity of the data plotted together in this fash-
ion demonstrates the similarity of Na-rare-gas potentials
for these four systems and shows that Lennard-Jones and
Morse potentials are too simplistic to accurately model
the data here.

In conclusion, we have measured ρ to a typical accu-
racy of 9% at various Na velocities in gases of Ar, Kr, Xe,
and N2. The consistency of our scaled data for diﬀerent
gases suggests that the shape g(x) of diﬀerent Na-rare-
gas potentials is similar. However, discrepancies in the
comparison to predictions of ρ suggest that the shape of
the potential is not well understood theoretically. Unfor-
tunately, the diﬃculty of the inverse scattering problem
[27, 28] prevents us from deriving the potential based on
knowledge of f (k). However, our explorations of modiﬁ-

cations to suggested interatomic potentials do indicate
that they would agree better with our measurements
if V (r) were modiﬁed such that V (r0) = 0 occurs at
smaller r0 and the well were made less deep in the range
re < r < 2re [24]. Our measurements should be useful in
evaluating future reﬁnements of the relevant interatomic
potentials.

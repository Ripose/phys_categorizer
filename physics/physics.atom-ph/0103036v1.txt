Abstract

We present a convergent variational basis-set calculational scheme for elas-

tic scattering of positronium atom by hydrogen atom in S wave. Highly cor-

related trial functions with appropriate symmetry are needed for achieving

convergence. We report convergent results for scattering lengths in atomic

units for both singlet (= 3.49

0.20) and triplet (= 2.46

0.10) states.

Lately, there has been interest in the experimental [1] and theoretical [2–8] studies of

ortho positronium (Ps) atom scattering by diﬀerent neutral atomic and molecular targets.

The Ps-H system is theoretically the most simple and fundamental and a complete under-

standing of this system is necessary before a venture to more complex targets [7–9]. There

have been R-matrix [3], close-coupling (CC) [4,10] and model-potential [5,11] calculations

for Ps-H scattering. Here we present a convergent variational basis-set calculational scheme

for low-energy Ps-H scattering in S wave below the lowest Ps-excitation threshold at 5.1 eV.

Using this method we report numerical results for scattering length of electronic singlet and

triplet states.

A recent study based on a regularized nonlocal electron-exchange model potential [6]

yielded low-energy (total) cross sections in agreement with experiment for Ps scattering

by He [6], Ne [7], Ar [7] and H2 [8]. For the Ps-H system the model-potential results for

S-wave singlet binding and resonance energies are in agreement with accurate variational

estimates [12]. It would be interesting to see if the model-potential result for the Ps-H singlet

scattering length agrees with the present convergent calculation.

Because of the existence of two identical fermions (electrons) in the Ps-H system, one

needs to antisymmetrize the full wave function before attempting a solution of the scattering

problem. The position vectors of the electrons

r1 (Ps) and r2 (H)

and positron (x) with

The full Ps-H Hamiltonian H can be broken in two convenient forms as follows H =

(8) and (9) are also valid for the K matrix and in partial-wave form where the momentum-

space integration over the Green’s function G1 should be performed with the principal-value

prescription.

In the calculation, the basis functions are taken in the following form

fm(r2, ρ1, s1) = ϕ(r2)η(ρ1)e−δmr2−αmρ1−βms1−γm(ρ2+r12)−µm(x+r1) sin(ks1)

wave functions, respectively. For elastic scattering the direct Born amplitude is zero and the

exchange correlation dominates scattering. To be consistent with this, the direct terms in the

form factors

are zero with the above choice of correlations in

the basis functions via γm and µm. This property follows as the above function is invariant

w.r.t. the interchange of x and r1 whereas the remaining part of the integrand in the direct

terms changes sign under this transformation. A proper choice of the correlation parameters

γm and µm is crucial for obtaining good convergence.

In the following we specialize to the K-matrix formulation in S wave at zero energy, when

sin(ks1)/(ks1) = 1 in (10). The useful matrix elements of the present approach are explicitly

We tested the convergence of the integrals by varying the number of integration points in

the x, s1 and s2 integrals in (21), (23) and (24) and the t integral in (22). The evaluation of

(21), (23) and (24) essentially involves four-dimensional integration, which is performed with

caution. The x integration was relatively easy and 20 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points

appropriately distributed between 0 and 16 were enough for convergence. In the evaluation

of integrals of type (22) 40 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points were suﬃcient for adequate

convergence. The convergence in the numerical integration over s1 and s2 was achieved

with 300 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points between 0 and 12. The maximum value of l

6

in the sum in (21), (23) and (24), L, is taken to be 6 which is suﬃcient for obtaining the

convergence with the partial-wave expansions (16)

(20).

In a numerical calculation a judicial choice of the parameters in (10) is needed

for rapid convergence. As the variational method does not provide a bound on the

result, the method could converge to a wrong scattering length if an inappropriate

(incomplete) basis set is choosen. After some experimentation we ﬁnd that to ob-

tain proper convergence the parameters δn and αn should be taken to have both

positive and negative values, γn and µn should include values close to unity and

βn should have progressively increasing values till about 1.5. The results reported

in this work are obtained with the following parameters for the functions fn, n =

In table 1 we show the convergence pattern of the present calculation w.r.t. the number

of partial waves L and basis functions N used in the calculation. The convergence is smooth

with increasing L. However, as the present calculation does not produce a bound on the

7

result, the convergence is not monotonic with increasing N. The lack of an upper bound in

this calculation is clearly revealed in table 1 where the results do not decrease monotonically

as the number of terms in the trial wave function is increased. The unbounded nature of

the results is consistent with the noted oscillation of the scattering lengths as N increases.

The oscillation is larger in the singlet state where it is more diﬃcult to obtain convergence.

Although, the ﬁnal result for the largest N and L is supposed to be the most accurate, it

is not known whether this result is larger or smaller than the exact one. Also, an estimate

of error of this result is not known.

It is diﬃcult to provide a quantitative measure of

convergence. However, from the noted ﬂuctuation of the results for large N for L = 6

we believe the error in the triplet scattering length to be less than 0.10 and in the singlet

scattering length to be less than 0.20. The ﬁnal results of the present calculation are those for

N = 13 and L = 6 with the above estimate of error: as = 3.49

0.20 au and at = 2.46

au.

The maximum number of functions (N = 13) used in this calculation is also pretty

small, compared to those used in diﬀerent Kohn-type variational calculations for electron-

hydrogen (N = 56) [16] and positron-hydrogen (N

286) [17] scattering. Because of the

≤

explicit appearance of the Green’s function, the present basis-set approach is similar to the

Schwinger variational method. Using the Schwinger method, convergent results for electron-

hydrogen [18] and positron-hydrogen [19] scattering have been obtained with a relatively

small basis set (N

10). These suggest a more rapid convergence in these problems with a

Schwinger-type method.

∼

Now we compare the present results with those of other calculations. While a static-

exchange calculation by Hara and Fraser [10] yielded as = 7.28 au and at = 2.48 au a

model potential calculation by Drachman and Houston [11] produced as = 5.33 au and

at = 2.36 au. A 22-state R-matrix calculation by Campbell et al. [3] and a six-state CC

calculation by Sinha et al. [4] yielded as = 5.20 au, at = 2.45 au and as = 5.90 au, at = 2.32

au, respectively. These triplet scattering lengths are in qualitative agreement with the

present result: at = 2.46

0.10. However, the singlet scattering lengths of these calculations

±

have not yet converged. The disagreement in the singlet channel shows that it is more

diﬃcult to get the converged result in the attractive singlet channel than in the repulsive

8

triplet channel. This is consistent with the common wisdom that a scattering model at low

energies is more sensitive to the detail of an eﬀective attractive interaction than to that of a

repulsive interaction. The nonconvergence of these results for the singlet scattering length

was conjectured before [5]. Using a correlation between the S-wave scattering length and

binding energy for the Ps-H system, the value as = 3.5 au was predicted in that study [5]

in excellent agreement with the present result: as = 3.49

0.20.

±

To summarize, we have formulated a convergent basis-set calculational scheme for S-wave

Ps-H elastic scattering below the lowest inelastic threshold using a variational expression for

the transition matrix. We illustrate the method numerically by calculating the singlet and

triplet scattering lengths: as = 3.49

0.20 au and at = 2.46

0.10 au.

Abstract

Calculations of various corrections to the g factor of Li-like ions are presented, which result in a sig-

niﬁcant improvement of the theoretical accuracy in the region Z = 6 – 92. The conﬁguration-interaction

Dirac-Fock method is employed for the evaluation of the interelectronic-interaction correction of order

1/Z 2 and higher. This correction is combined with the 1/Z interelectronic-interaction term derived within

a rigorous QED approach. The one-electron QED corrections of ﬁrst in α are calculated to all orders in

the parameter αZ. The screening of QED corrections is taken into account to the leading orders in αZ and

1/Z.

INTRODUCTION

Recent high-precision measurements of g factors of H-like carbon [1, 2] and oxygen [3] have

provided a possibility for studying binding QED effects in an external magnetic ﬁeld in these

systems. The experiments were performed on single H-like ions conﬁned in a Penning ion trap at

low temperatures. A relative accuracy of 5 × 10−10 was obtained in Ref. [2] for the ratio of the

electronic Larmor precession frequency ωL and the ion cyclotron frequency ωc, which is connected

with the g-factor value by

ωL

(1)

where e is the elementary charge unit, q is the charge of the ion, mion is the ion mass, and m

is the electron mass. The experimental results are shown to be sensitive to one- and two-loop

binding QED effects and to the nuclear-recoil corrections. Further progress is anticipated from

the experimental side, as well as an extension of measurements to the ions with more than one

electron.

New perspectives for testing QED effects in g factors of highly charged ions motivated numer-

ous theoretical investigations on this subject during the last years. We mention here numerical

calculations of the one-loop self-energy correction to all orders in αZ [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], numerical

[5, 6] and analytical [9, 10, 11] evaluations of the one-loop vacuum-polarization contribution, an-

alytical results for the nuclear-size correction [9, 12], and calculations of the nuclear-recoil effects

[13, 14, 15, 16] and two-loop binding QED corrections [17, 18, 19]. As a result of these studies,

the present theoretical accuracy of the g-factor values is several times better than that of the exper-

imental results. An important consequence of the investigations of the g factor is the possibility

to determine the electron mass from Eq. (1) by combining the theoretical g-factor value and the

experimental result for ωL/ωc. We note that the 1998 CODATA value for the electron mass [20]

has an error of 2 × 10−9, which is 4 times larger than the experimental uncertainty of the result

for carbon [2] and 3 times larger than the one for oxygen [3]. A new determination of the electron

mass presented in Refs. [3, 7, 14, 21] provided an improvement of the accuracy of the electron

mass by a factor of 4. As a result, the 2002 CODATA value for the electron mass [22] is derived

mainly from the g factor of H-like ions. It is expected that in the future an extension of experi-

mental investigations towards higher-Z ions could lead also to an independent determination of

the ﬁne structure constant α [18, 23].

The accuracy of theoretical values for the g factor of high-Z H-like ions is presently limited by

2

nuclear effects [15, 24]. The uncertainty introduced by them in the high-Z region is comparable

with the binding QED correction of second order in α. Since the nuclear effects do not allow an

accurate theoretical description at present, this puts a serious obstacle on the way to improvement

of theoretical predictions and to an identiﬁcation of two-loop QED corrections in future experi-

ments. However, it was recently shown [25, 26] that the uncertainty due to the nuclear effects can

be signiﬁcantly reduced in a speciﬁc combination of the g factors of H- and Li-like ions with the

same nucleus,

g′ = g(1s)2 2s − ξ g1s ,

(2)

where g1s and g(1s)2 2s are the g factors of H- and Li-like ions, respectively, and the parameter ξ is

calculated numerically, as explained in Ref. [25]. Numerical calculations show that the inﬂuence

of the nuclear effects on the difference g′ is by two orders of magnitude smaller than that on the

g-factor values g1s and g(1s)2 2s separately. Therefore, the speciﬁc difference g′ can be in principle

studied up to much higher accuracy than the g factor of an H-like or Li-like ion. In order to realize

this project, one need to perform theoretical and experimental investigations of the g factor of

Li-like ions with an accuracy comparable to that for H-like ions.

Extending theoretical description from an H-like to a Li-like ion, one encounters a serious

complication due to the presence of additional electrons. Moreover, all contributions to the g − 2

value for an ns state are of pure relativistic and QED origin, which makes the treatment of the

electron correlation much more intricate than, e.g., in calculating the binding energies. A number

of relativistic calculations of the g factor of Li-like ions were carried out previously [27, 28, 29,

30, 31, 32]. However, in order to reach the accuracy comparable to the one for H-like ions, a

systematic treatment of the QED corrections is required. In our previous publications [25, 26], we

presented theoretical values for the g factor of Li-like ions including all presently known QED,

nuclear, and interelectronic-interaction corrections for a wide range of the nuclear-charge number

Z. The goal of the present investigation is to improve these theoretical predictions by calculating

several corrections that provide the leading uncertainty to the theoretical values.

For low-Z ions, the uncertainty of the g-factor values [25, 26] was mainly determined by the

error due to the interelectronic-interaction correction. A part of this correction that is of ﬁrst order

in 1/Z was evaluated in Ref. [25] within a rigorous QED approach, whereas the remainder (of

order 1/Z 2 and higher) was extracted from the variational calculations by Yan [30, 31] in case of

low-Z ions and from the many-body perturbation theory calculations by Lindroth and Ynnerman

[29] for high-Z ions. In the present work, we evaluate the interelectronic-interaction correction of

3

order 1/Z 2 and higher by a large-scale conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock method.

For middle- and high-Z ions, the main error of the theoretical values of Ref. [25] originated

from the binding QED correction.

In that work, it was evaluated to the leading order in αZ

[namely, (αZ)2] and to the zeroth order in 1/Z. In the present investigation, we employ the recent

calculation of the self-energy term of the one-electron QED correction to all orders in αZ [8]

and calculate the vacuum-polarization term. We also evaluate the screened QED correction to its

in the paper.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

The g factor of an atom with a spinless nucleus is deﬁned as

g =

1
µ0J
where H is the Hamiltonian of the atom in magnetic ﬁeld H, H = |H| and the z axis is directed
along H, E(H) is the energy of the state with the maximal (MJ = J) projection of the angular

momentum on the z axis, and µ0 = |e|/(2m) is the Bohr magneton. If the perturbation theory of

ﬁrst order in H is used to obtain the energy shift ∆E(H), Eq. (3) can be written as

g =

1
µ0J

∆E(H)
H

.

(4)

(5)

In what follows, we will use both deﬁnitions.

In the case of a high-Z Li-like ion, in the zeroth-order approximation one can neglect the

interaction of the 2s electron with the closed (1s)2 shell. We thus use the one-electron Dirac

equation as the starting point in our evaluation of the g factor. The corresponding Hamiltonian is

h = α · p + βm + V + V magn ,

where V = −αZ/r is the Coulomb potential induced by the nucleus and V magn = −eα · A

represents the interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld. For the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld the vector
potential is A = 1/2[H × r] and thus V magn = −(e/2)H · [r × α].

Evaluating the energy shift as the expectation value of V magn with the Dirac wave functions,

we obtain the lowest-order g-factor value for the 2s state,

gD =

where γ =

1 − (αZ)2. Various corrections to gD arise due to the interelectronic interaction

(∆gint), one-electron QED effects (∆gQED), the screened QED effects (∆gSQED), and nuclear

p

effects (∆gnuc). We thus write the total theoretical value for the g factor as

g = gD + ∆gint + ∆gQED + ∆gSQED + ∆gnuc ,

(7)

with the corrections ∆gint, ∆gQED, ∆gSQED, and ∆gnuc evaluated in Sections III, IV, V, and VI,

respectively.

INTERELECTRONIC INTERACTION

To evaluate the interelectronic-interaction effects, we start with the relativistic Hamiltonian in

the no-pair approximation,

H = Λ+

h(j) + H int

j
(cid:16)X

Λ+, H int = H C + H B ,
(cid:17)

where h is the one-particle Dirac Hamiltonian (5), the index j = 1 . . . N numerates the electrons,

H C is the Coulomb interaction, H B is the Breit interaction, and Λ+ is the projector on the positive-

energy states, which is the product of the one-electron projectors λ+(i),

Here,

Λ+ = λ+(1) · · · λ+(N) .

λ+(i) =

| un(i)ihun(i) | ,

n
X

where un(i) are the positive-energy eigenstates of an effective one-particle Hamiltonian hu. Two

different Hamiltonians h and hHFD were considered as the operator hu, where h is the one-electron

Dirac Hamiltonian (5) and hHFD is the Hartree-Fock-Dirac operator without the Breit interaction

but including the interaction with the external ﬁeld [33, 34]. However, since hHFD corresponds to

a better zero approximation and, therefore, provides much faster convergence, all the ﬁnal results

were obtained with this Hamiltonian. In both cases the functions un and hence the projector Λ+

depend on the external magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, the derivative with respect to H in Eq. (3) con-

tains not only the derivative of the one-electron part of the Hamiltonian (8), but also the derivative

of the projector Λ+. The derivative of Λ+ can be obtained explicitly and one can show that its

contribution to the g factor is equivalent to the contribution of the negative-energy states.

(8)

(9)

(10)

5

In our computational approach, we obtain the g-factor value by using Eq. (3) in the ﬁnite-

difference approximation,

g =

1
µ0J

E(δH) − E(−δH)
2 δH

+ O[(δH)3] ,

(11)

since the Hellman-Feynman theorem is not exactly fulﬁlled for the approximate wave functions.

The optimal choice of the ﬁnite difference δH was found to be 0.001 (a.u./µ0). We checked that

scaling this value by a factor of 2 does not inﬂuence our results for the g factor.

In order to determine the space of one-electron functions {ϕj}M

j=1, we employed the combined
Dirac-Fock (DF) (j = 1, . . . , m) and the Dirac-Fock-Sturm (DFS) (j = m + 1, . . . , M) basis

set. The index j here enumerates different occupied and vacant one-electron states. The external

magnetic ﬁeld and the Breit interaction were not included in the DF and DFS operators, when

the basis set was generated. For the occupied atomic shells, the orbitals ϕj were obtained by

the restricted DF method, based on a numerical solution of the radial DF equations. The vacant

orbitals ϕj (j = m + 1, . . . , M) were obtained by solving the Dirac-Fock-Sturm equations

hDF − εj0

˜ϕj = λjW (r) ˜ϕj ,

j = m + 1, . . . , M,

(12)

where hDF is the Dirac-Fock operator, εj0 is the one-electron energy of the occupied DF orbital

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

ϕj0, and W (r) is a constant-sign weight function. The parameter λj in Eq. (12) can be considered

as an eigenvalue of the Sturmian operator. If W (r) → 0 at r → ∞, all Sturmian functions ϕj

have the same asymptotics at r → ∞. It is clear that for λj = 0 the Sturmian function coincides

with the reference DF orbital ϕj0. The widely used choice of the weight function is W (r) = 1/r,

which leads to the well-known “charge quantization”. In the relativistic case this choice is not very

successful. In our calculations we used the following weight function

W (r) =

1 − exp[−(αr)2]
(αr)2

,

(13)

which, unlike 1/r, is regular at the origin. It is well known that the Sturmian operator is Hermitian

and, contrary to the Fock operator, does not have the continuum spectra. Therefore, the set of

the Sturmian eigenfunctions including the negative-energy states forms the discrete and complete

basis set in the space of one-electron wave functions. This basis set is orthogonal with the weight

function W (r).

joined DF and DFS basis,

To generate the one-electron wave functions ψn, we used the unrestricted DF method in the

ψn =

Cjnϕj .

(14)

j
X

6

The coefﬁcients Cjn were obtained by solving HFD matrix equations

ˆF Cn = εn ˆSCn,

(15)

where ˆF is the Dirac-Fock matrix in the joined basis of DF and DFS orbitals of a free ion. The
external magnetic ﬁeld was included in the ˆF matrix, whereas the Breit interaction was not. The
matrix ˆS in Eq. (15) is nonorthogonal, since the DFS orbitals are not orthogonal in the usual

sense. The negative-energy DFS functions were included in the total basis set. Eq. (15) was used

to generate the whole set of orthogonal one-electron wave functions ψn(n = 1, . . . M), including

all vacant states.

It should be noted that even if the external magnetic ﬁeld H is equal to zero, the set of one-

electron functions ψn differs from the set of basis functions ϕj. For the occupied states, the unre-

stricted DF method accounts for the core-polarization effects (the spin polarization in our case), in

contrast to the restricted DF method. For the vacant states the difference is more signiﬁcant, since

the DF and DFS operators are essentially different.

The large-scale conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock (CI-DF) method was used to solve the

Dirac-Coulomb-Breit equation in the external magnetic ﬁeld

HΨ(γMJ ) = E(γMJ ) Ψ(γMJ )

(16)

where H is the non-pair Hamiltonian (8). The many-electron wave function Ψ(γMJ ) with quan-

tum numbers γ and MJ was expanded in terms of a large number of the Slater determinants (SD)

with the same projection MJ of the total angular momentum J

Ψ(γMJ ) =

cα(γMJ ) detα(MJ ).

(17)

The conﬁguration state functions (CSFs) with angular momentum J were not used in our calcu-

lations, since the Hamiltonian H contains the interaction with the external magnetic ﬁeld and,

therefore, does not commute with the operator J 2. The Slater determinants are constructed from

the one-electron wave functions ψn (14). The same orbitals were used in Eq. (10) in order to

construct the projector Λ+. The basis of one-electron functions used in our calculations was

12s 11p 10d 6f 4g 2h 1i. The set of the SD in expansion (17) was generated including all single,

double, and triple excitations. The total number of SD was 552359. The results of the calculation

are presented in Table I. The interelectronic-interaction correction ∆gCI−DF

is the difference of

The result for the ∆gCI−DF

int

correction obtained by the CI-DF method can be improved by em-

ploying a rigorous QED treatment of the part of this correction that is of order 1/Z, which was

presented in Ref. [25]. In order to combine two different treatments, we isolate the contribution
of order 1/Z 2 and higher from the ∆gCI−DF
calculated in the Breit approximation. The resulting “higher-order” correction (∆g(2+)

correction by subtracting the value of the 1/Z term

) is listed

To compare our results with the corresponding Yan’s calculations [30, 31], which account for

the lowest-order (∼ α2) relativistic effects, we have isolated the α2 contribution in our CI-DF

calculation. It was done by four times increase of the velocity of light (in atomic units) and by

an extrapolation of the obtained results (with the α2 factor isolated) to the c = ∞ limit. Table II,

which presents the related comparison for g − 2 values, shows that for Z > 5 the contribution of

the higher-order relativistic effects is much larger than the difference between our α2 results and

those of Yan.

IV. ONE-ELECTRON QED CORRECTIONS

To zeroth order in 1/Z, the QED correction for the ground state of a Li-like ion is given by the

one-electron QED contribution evaluated for the 2s Dirac state. This correction is represented by

a perturbation expansion in the ﬁne-structure constant α,

∆gQED = ∆g(1)

QED + ∆g(2)

QED + . . . ,

(18)

where the superscript indicates the order in α.

The ﬁrst-order QED correction is given by the sum of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization

contributions, ∆g(1)

VP. The self-energy correction for the 2s state was recently
calculated to all orders in αZ in Ref. [8]. The corresponding results are listed in the second column

QED = ∆g(1)

SE + ∆g(1)

of Table III. The vacuum-polarization correction consists of two parts that can be thought to orig-

inate from the ﬁrst-order vacuum-polarization diagram with the magnetic interaction inserted into

8

the external electron line (the electric-loop contribution ∆ge

VP), and into the vacuum-polarization
VP). The electric-loop contribution is calculated in the
present work by utilizing the known expression for the Uehling potential and approximate for-

loop (the magnetic-loop contribution ∆gm

mulas for the Wichmann-Kroll potential taken from Ref. [35]. The results of the calculation are

presented in the third and fourth columns of Table III. The remaining magnetic-loop correction

is known to vanish in the Uehling approximation, and its contribution is small as compared to the

electric-loop part. This correction was calculated to all orders in αZ only for the 1s state [5, 6].

Because of this, we employ the analytical result of Ref. [11] for its leading contribution in αZ,

which reads (for an ns state),

∆gm

VP =

7
216

α(αZ)5
n3

.

The corresponding results are listed in the ﬁfth column of Table III. The uncertainty of the

magnetic-loop contribution is estimated by comparison of the all-order numerical results of

Ref. [6] for the 1s state with the lowest-order analytical result (19).

QED corrections of higher orders in α have not been calculated to all orders in αZ up to now.

Two ﬁrst terms of their αZ expansion can be represented by the free-electron g−2 factor multiplied

by a relativistic kinematical factor [17, 18, 25, 36]. The result yields (for an ns state)

a(2)
40 (2s) = −19.781 820 939 (1). This expression accounts for the complete logarithmic depen-
dence in this order and the dominant part of the constant term. We observe, however, that in the

(24)

(25)

one-loop case, inclusion of the term of the order (αZ)4 is meaningful for sufﬁciently small values

of Z only. In the high-Z region, addition of this term makes the αZ-expansion results deviate

more from the “exact” numerical values. We thus include the contribution (25) for Z ≤ 30 only.

The relative uncertainty of the two-loop binding QED correction for Z ≤ 30 was estimated as the

ratio of the part of the one-loop QED correction that is of order (αZ)5 and higher to the part that

is within the (αZ)4 approximation [19], multiplied by a factor of 4. For Z > 30, we estimate the

relative uncertainty by the ratio of the part of the one-loop QED correction that is of order (αZ)4

and higher to the part that is within the (αZ)2 approximation, multiplied by a factor of 2.

V. SCREENED QED CORRECTIONS

In this section we investigate the inﬂuence of the interelectronic interaction on the QED effects,

known also as the “screening” of QED corrections. To derive the screened QED correction of ﬁrst

order in 1/Z, we apply an approximate method, which yields the complete result to the order

(αZ)2. Following Hegstrom [39], we adopt the Hamiltonian

H =

h(j) +

hrad(j) + H int,

(26)

j

where h is deﬁned by Eq. (5), H int incorporates the interelectronic interaction within the Breit

The matrices αj, βj, Σj here act on the spinor variables of the jth electron. To ﬁrst order in

1/Z, the screened QED correction to the g factor can be now derived by the standard Rayleigh-

Schr¨odinger perturbation theory, separating corrections linear in the magnetic ﬁeld H, which are

of ﬁrst order in the parameter 1/Z. The contributions of interest can be conventionally represented

by the following combinations:

∆E1 ∼ H rad

1 × H int + (permutations) ,

∆E2 ∼ H rad

2 × V magn × H int + (permutations) ,

∆E3 ∼ H rad

3 × V magn + (permutations) .

After angular integration, the summation over the complete Dirac-Coulomb spectrum was per-

formed by the ﬁnite basis set method with basis functions constructed from B splines [40, 41].
The numerical results for the screened QED correction of ﬁrst order in 1/Z, ∆g(1)

SQED, are pre-

sented in Table IV in terms of the function R(αZ), deﬁned as

∆g(1)

SQED = (gfree − 2)

R(αZ) .

The terms Ri(αZ) with i = 1, 2, and 3 are induced by Eqs. (34)-(36), respectively.

The screened QED correction of higher orders in 1/Z should be accounted for when consider-

ing low-Z ions. We extract this correction from the recent evaluations by Yan [30, 31], which were

where R(0) = −274/2187. The functions R, Q, . . . here do not have any dependence on Z since

Yan’s calculations are based on the nonrelativistic form of the Hamiltonian (26). We obtain the

numerical value of Q(0) by ﬁtting Yan’s results for Z = 3–12 to the form (38), which yields

Q(0) = 0.071(1). With this value of Q(0), formula (38) was used to estimate the higher-order

screened QED correction for Z > 12.

VI. NUCLEAR EFFECTS

In this section we brieﬂy summarize the known results for the nuclear effects on the g factor

of Li-like ions. The correction to the Dirac g-factor value due to the extended nuclear size is

relatively simple. For high-Z ions, it is evaluated numerically by employing the Fermi model

for the nuclear-charge distribution. The uncertainty is estimated by taking the difference of the

results obtained for the Fermi and sphere nuclear models. For low-Z ions, to a good accuracy, this

correction can be evaluated by a simple analytical formula obtained in Ref. [12],

Here C = 0.5772156649 . . . is the Euler constant and the expectation value has to be evaluated

with the proper nuclear-charge density.

Systematic QED theory for the nuclear-recoil effect on the atomic g factor to the ﬁrst order

in m/M and to all orders in αZ was developed in Ref. [13]. The one-electron recoil correction

derived in that work is expressed as the sum of the lower-order and the higher-order term. The ﬁrst

for the 1s state only. These numerical results showed the (αZ)5 behaviour of this term at low Z.

We estimate the relative uncertainty of the result (40) due to neglecting the higher-order term as

the ratio ∆grec,H/∆grec,L for the 1s state, multiplied by a factor of 1.5.

The contribution of the two-electron recoil effect can be extracted from the results of Yan

[30, 31]. For Z = 3 − 12, it was evaluated as the difference of Yan’s result of order α2m/M and

the nonrelativistic limit of Eq. (40). Fitting this difference to the form

VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Table VI, we present the individual contributions to the g factor of the ground state of Li-

like ions. The Dirac point-nucleus value is obtained by Eq. (6). The ﬁnite nuclear size correction

to this value is evaluated by Eq. (39) for low-Z ions and by a direct numerical solution of the

Dirac equation for high-Z ions. The interelectronic-interaction correction ∆gint is the sum of the
part of ﬁrst order in 1/Z, ∆g(1)
∆g(2+)
int

int , obtained in framework of QED and of the higher-order part,
, evaluated by the CI-DF method, as described in Section III. The QED correction of

order α is the sum of the one-electron self-energy and vacuum-polarization terms presented in

Table III. The QED correction of order α2 and higher incorporates the known terms of the αZ

expansion, as explained in Section IV. The screened QED correction is discussed in Section V,

the corresponding results are taken from Table V. The nuclear recoil correction is obtained as

explained in Section VI. For lead and uranium, we include also the nuclear-polarization correction

calculated in Ref. [24].

Table VI demonstrates a signiﬁcant improvement achieved comparing to our previous evalu-

ations [25, 26]. The uncertainty of the presented theoretical values for carbon and oxygen is 2

and 3 times better than those of Ref. [26], respectively; whereas for uranium the accuracy is im-

proved by two orders of magnitude. Progress in the high-Z region is mainly due to the evaluation

of the one-loop QED corrections to all order in αZ, while for low-Z ions it is largely due to the

interelectronic-interaction correction and the screened QED correction.

The accuracy of the theoretical values in Table VI is several parts in 10−8 for low-Z ions and a

few parts in 10−7 for middle-Z ions. It decreases further with Z increasing and reaches 5×10−6 for

uranium. So, despite the achieved improvement, the accuracy for Li-like ions is still signiﬁcantly

lower than that for H-like ions [7, 15] and also than the precision that can be presently addressed

in experiments [1, 2, 3]. In particular, the nearest aim of experimental investigations of the Mainz-

GSI collaboration is the g factor of Li-like calcium. The anticipated experimental accuracy is at

the ppb level, which can be compared with the relative theoretical error of 10−7 from Table VI.

The uncertainty of the present theoretical values is mainly deﬁned by the interelectronic-

interaction correction and by the screened QED correction. An improvement in the theoretical

description of the interelectronic-interaction effects can be achieved by a rigorous QED treatment

of the part of order 1/Z 2 and by calculating the remainder within the Breit approximation. Such

a program has been carried out for the Lamb shift in Li-like ions [42, 43, 44, 45]. However, a

similar calculation for the g factor is going to be signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult due to the presence of

the external magnetic interaction and requires a further development of methods of calculational

QED. As to the screened QED correction, in the present work it was calculated to its leading order

in αZ only. As a ﬁrst step beyond this approximation, which can improve the results for this cor-

rection in the high-Z region, one may consider an evaluation of the one-loop QED corrections in

an effective potential that partly accounts for the interelectronic-interaction effects [46, 47]. These

two topics will be the subjects of our subsequent investigations.

In summary, we have presented calculations of the interelectronic-interaction, one-electron

QED, and screened QED corrections to the g factor of the ground state of Li-like ions. This re-

sulted in a signiﬁcant improvement of theoretical predictions in a wide range of the nuclear-charge

values Z. We have analyzed also perspectives for further progress in the theoretical description of

these systems and for probing the QED effects in future experiments.

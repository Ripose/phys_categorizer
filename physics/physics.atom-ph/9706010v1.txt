Abstract

≤

≤

The hyperﬁne structure of 5snd 1D2 states in 87Sr was
studied for principal quantum numbers 11
25
by Doppler-free two-photon excitation combined with
thermionic detection. Based on the more accurate
data, compared to previous results, the hyperﬁne
structure was analysed by second order perturbation
theory using MQDT wavefunctions. As a result we
ﬁnd that the surprisingly large B-factors obtained by
ﬁtting the data with the Casimir formula do not re-
ﬂect a quadrupolar interaction but rather consist pre-
dominantly of second order magnetic dipole contri-
butions. Further, inconsistencies in the King plot of
odd-even isotope shifts were removed by this type of
analysis. The result demonstrates the importance of
higher order eﬀects in hyperﬁne splittings of excited
states in atoms with two valence electrons, even when
the ﬁne structure splitting is large compared to the
hyperﬁne splitting.

Introduction

Many problems in atomic physics can be treated
using perturbation theory. Normally for low lying
states with large energy distances to neighbouring
levels the application of perturbation theory in ﬁrst
order gives satisfying results. However, the level spac-

ing of high lying states (Rydberg states) is consider-
ably smaller and higher order perturbation theory is
required for correct treatment.

The electron conﬁguration of excited states of the
alkaline earth elements is determined by the two elec-
trons outside a core of closed electron shells. The
existence of low lying bound doubly excited states
causes conﬁguration mixing and inﬂuences the cou-
pling of the two valence electrons (singlet-triplet
mixing). The multichannel quantum defect theory
(MQDT) has proved to be an eﬃcient tool [1] for the
description of such perturbed Rydberg states with
only a small set of parameters.

Particularly the atomic hyperﬁne structure (hfs) is
sensitive to admixtures in the wave function of Ryd-
berg states [2] and is therefore a most sensitive quan-
tity for investigating such phenomena.

For the evaluation of the hfs it is in most cases suf-
ﬁcient to consider only the magnetic dipole and the
electric quadrupole interaction. Then it is possible to
parameterize the hfs – splitting in ﬁrst order pertur-
bation theory by the hyperﬁne constants A and B, us-
ing the Casimir formula. The hyperﬁne constants A
and B measure the magnitude of the magnetic dipole
and the electric quadrupole interaction, respectively.
This kind of evaluation and separation of the interac-
tions assumes that contributions of higher order per-
turbation theory are negligible. If that is not the case
the hyperﬁne constants lose their physical meaning.
Previously, the eﬀects of higher order contributions
to the hfs in Rydberg states due to neighbouring
ﬁne structure levels have been observed in Hg [3–5],

1

3He [6], Ca [7], Sr [2, 7–10], Ba [2, 7, 11–15], Sm [16],
Yb [18], and Pb [17]. For very high Rydberg states
the energy spacing of states with diﬀerent principal
quantum number n is small enough to cause hyper-
ﬁne induced mixing [19–21].

In the present work we report on high resolu-
tion laser spectroscopic measurements of the hfs of
5snd 1D2 states in 87Sr and of transition isotope
shifts of the stable isotopes 84,86,88Sr for principal
quantum numbers 11
25. These measure-
n
ments were done with enhanced accuracy compared
to previous results [22, 23], in order to obtain suﬃ-
ciently precise data for accurate comparison of the
hfs with the results derived from second order per-
turbation theory. The hfs was calculated by means of
MQDT-wavefunctions in ﬁrst and second order per-
turbation theory. We found that second order contri-
butions need to be considered in the analysis of the
hfs in order to explain the unexpected large hyperﬁne
constant B and the shift of the hyperﬁne multiplet,
which is responsible for large deviations from the lin-
ear dependence in a King Plot analysis.

2 Experiment

The experimental set-up used in the present work
has been described in detail in an earlier paper [24].
Brieﬂy, it consisted of a cw narrow bandwidth ring
dye laser (Spectra Physics Model 380D) pumped by
an argon ion laser (Spectra Physics Model 2045).
Typical operating conditions were uv pump powers
of 2.5–3.0 W, resulting with a stilben 3 dye in 200–
400 mW single-mode power. The dye laser is tunable
between 410 and 470 nm. With these wavelengths
Sr I Rydberg levels above n = 8 can be excited from
the 5s2 1S0 ground state by Doppler-free two-photon
excitation. A Michelson-type wave meter (Burleigh
WA 20) with 300 MHz accuracy was used for iden-
tifying Rydberg levels up to n = 200. For measur-
ing the hfs – splittings the laser frequency was sta-
bilized to an external confocal cavity. This, in turn,
was controlled by an active molecular frequency stan-
dard with an accuracy of better than 100 kHz, using
several precisely known I2 levels combined with the
frequency-oﬀset-locking technique [25]. A computer

(HP 21 MX-E) was employed for real-time data ac-
quisition and for scanning and controlling the laser
frequency.

The Sr-atoms were excited and,

following colli-
sional ionization, detected with high eﬃciency in a
thermionic ring diode [26]. In order to improve the
signal to noise ratio, the retroreﬂected laser beam was
chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz for lock-in detection
(EG&G PAR Model 5210).

A typical spectrum of the 5s12d 1D2 state is shown
in Fig. 1. To determine the line positions, Lorentzian
line proﬁles were ﬁtted to the experimental data.
The accuracy of the line distances was enhanced by
recording and evaluating several spectra (up to 40)
for each state. The mean values of the transition fre-
quency diﬀerences with regard to 88Sr are listed in
Table 3.

3 Theory of hyperﬁne struc-

ture

The hyperﬁne interaction describes the interaction
between the electrons and the magnetic and electric
multipole moments of the nucleus, where the even
magnetic and the odd electric multipole moments
vanish. In most cases it is suﬃcient to take into ac-
count only the interaction with the nuclear magnetic
dipole moment µI = gI I and the electric quadrupole
moment Q. According to Sobel’man [27], the Hamil-
tonian can than be expressed as

and ℓ(1) and s(1) are the single electron angular mo-

Here I and J are the angular momenta of the nu-

The hfs constants A and B describe the magnitudes
of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole inter-
actions, respectively. Due to the diﬀerent dependence
on F of the two terms in Eq. (5), it is possible to ﬁt
the Casimir formula to experimentally determined hfs
– splittings, and to separate the contributions of the
magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole interac-
tion.

The measurement of the isotope shift (IS) is also
possible since for ﬁrst order perturbation theory the
center of gravity of a hyperﬁne multiplet remains un-
shifted (

F (2F + 1) = 0).

Hence when second order eﬀects are not negligible,
i.e. when neighbouring ﬁne structure levels with equal
quantum number F are lying close together, the en-
ergy splitting can no longer be approximated by the
Casimir formula. Then it is not possible to sepa-
rate magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contri-
butions from the experimental hfs – splittings, be-
cause the second order contribution of the magnetic
dipole interaction has a similar dependence on F as
the ﬁrst order contribution of the electric quadrupole
interaction. This is especially important when the
hfs is dominated by the magnetic dipole interaction.
The second order energy splitting goes together
with a shift of the center of gravity, since the con-
tribution of each ﬁne structure level has a diﬀerent F
dependence (only states with equal F are connected).
This has the consequence that the IS of a perturbed
hyperﬁne multiplet can only be extracted using sec-
ond order perturbation theory.

To study the inﬂuence of the second order contribu-
tions, one can calculate the hfs in ﬁrst and second or-
der perturbation theory if the ﬁne structure splitting
is known. For a two electron atom like Strontium the
magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interaction
can be written in terms of the one electron matrix
elements
. This has been worked out
by Lurio et al. [29] for a sℓ-conﬁguration. Explicit

4 Calculation of the hyperﬁne
splitting with MQDT wave-
functions

As shown in reference [1], the MQDT is a powerful
tool to describe perturbed Rydberg series of alkaline-
earth atoms.

The empirical MQDT study by Esherick [30]
showed that the J = 2 bound-state spectrum of
Strontium can be described by a ﬁve channel MQDT
model which includes the recoupling of 1D2 and 3D2
channels and the perturbation of the 5snd 1D2 and
3D2 series by the 4dn′s 1D2, 4dn′s 3D2 and 5pn′′p 1D2
channels. Here, n′ and n′′ are the principal quantum
numbers of the Rydberg series converging to the 4d
and 5p ionization limits. Within the accuracy of that
analysis it was found that it is not necessary to in-
clude the 4dn′′′d 1D2 channel.

Since there are only a few doubly-excited states
below the ﬁrst ionization limit, the empirical MQDT
study cannot give the exact admixture of each dou-
bly excited channel to the levels although the total
amount of the doubly-excited channels can be well
distinguished from the singly-excited ones. In partic-
ular Esherick’s analysis can not be used to distinguish
between the 5pn′′p 1D2 and 4dn′′′d 1D2 channels. On
the other hand, MCHF calculations performed by As-
pect et al. [31] and ab initio MQDT calculations of
Aymar et al. [32] indicate that the 4dn′′′d component
is twice as large as the 5pn′′p one. Thus the wave-
function of the even J = 2 bound states of Sr can be
written as an expansion of pure LS states with the
following terms

where the zi are the mixing coeﬃcients obtained by
using Esherick’s [30] MQDT parameter. The mixing
coeﬃcients for the 5snd 1D2 and 5snd 3D2 states are
drawn in Figs. 2 and 3 for principal quantum numbers
11
25. The data show a strong singlet-triplet
mixing in the 5snd conﬁguration around n = 16. The
main contribution of the doubly excited channels in
this region of principal quantum numbers comes from
the 4dn′s conﬁguration, where also a singlet-triplet
mixing occurs.

≤

≤

As studied earlier [22], the hfs of the 5snd 1D2 and

4

6
3D2 states is dominated by the Fermi-contact term
of the magnetic dipole interaction of the 5s electron
and depends strongly on the mixing coeﬃcients z1
and z2. The nℓ Rydberg electron has only a weak
interaction with the nucleus. For pure 5snd 1D2 Ry-
dberg states the hfs – splitting should almost vanish
and for pure 5snd 3D2 the dipole constant A should
be nearly a5s/12. Only a weak quadrupole interac-
tion due to the small admixtures of doubly excited
channels is expected.

In the calculation of the hyperﬁne splitting of the
5snd 1D2 states in second order pertubation theory
states of diﬀerent J and equal F enter the matrix
elements (cf. Eq. 7). These are the ﬁne structure
levels 5snd 3D1, 3D2, and 3D3 whereas the 5snd 1D2
and 3D2 states are described by Eq. 14, the expansion
of the 5snd 3D1 and 5snd 3D3 states are taken from
the two channel MQDT analysis given in Ref. [34] in
which the mixing of the 5snd and 4dn′s conﬁguration
have been considered. Thus the wavefunctions of the
J = 1 and J = 3 states can be written as:

i

= α1|
= β1|

γJ = 1

γJ = 3
|

4dn′s 3D1iLS (14)
5snd 3D1iLS + α2|
4dn′s 3D3iLS (15)
5snd 3D3iLS + β2|
The mixing coeﬃcients αi and βi can be calculated
with the MQDT parameters given in Ref. [34].

i

The evaluation of the matrix elements is done here
without considering matrix elements between diﬀer-
ent conﬁgurations ℓ1ℓ2. This is a reliable procedure
because these matrix elements vanish in most cases,
especially for the Fermi-contact term, or are very
small due to the diﬀerent eﬀective quantum numbers.
However, in special situations [33] the oﬀ-diagonal
conﬁguration matrix elements can be quit large.

the

Further

energy diﬀerences between the
5snd 1D2 states and the other ﬁne structure terms are
needed for the calculations. These are listed in Table
1 and illustrated in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the
energy diﬀerences of the three ﬁne structure terms
change their sign at diﬀerent principal quantum num-
bers. As studied earlier [10], the small diﬀerence be-
tween the 5snd 1D2 and 5snd 3D3 series at n = 19
results in a large shift of the respective hyperﬁne mul-
tiplets.

n′′p or n′′′d electron in a state can be approximately
obtained by subtracting the energy of the inner orbit
(eg. 5s) from the energy of the state
. The ener-
i
gies of the 5s, 5p and 4d orbits in Sr+ were taken from
Ref. [38], where the mean values of the ﬁne structure
components were used for the 5p and 4d orbits. For
the quadrupole moment of 87Sr, we used the value of

moment µI = gII =
1.089299(1)µN reported in
Ref. [41]. The matrix elements in Eqs. (16) to (18)
were then introduced into the expressions listed in
the Appendix to yield the energy splittings.

The results of the calculations are shown in Fig.
5. The second order contributions of the electric
quadrupole interaction are less than 1 kHz and will
be neglected here. It should be emphasized here that
the ﬁrst order electric quadrupole contributions are
approximately one hundred times smaller than the
second order magnetic dipole contributions. The sec-
ond order contribution of the magnetic dipole inter-
action in the 5s19d 1D2 state is not shown here be-
cause of the small energy separation to the 5s19d 3D3
state (
2 GHz). In that particular case the contri-
butions to the hfs are large in any higher order, which
means that perturbation theory is not longer appli-
cable. This is discussed in detail in Ref. [10].

5s electron, the calculated total hfs – splittings for

these states depend almost entirely on the mixing
coeﬃcients z1 and z2 and on the experimental value
of the a5s-factor.

5 Comparison with the experi-

mental data

5.1 Hyperﬁne Splitting

In Fig. 6 the calculated hfs – splittings are compared
with the experimental data. The isotope shifts of the
experimental data are taken into account by shifting
the centers of gravity of the calculated hyperﬁne mul-
tiplets to overlap with the experimental ones. Good
agreement between experimental and theoretical data
is achieved. The small deviations of the individual
components can be explained by the fact, that the
hfs is much more sensitive to the mixing parame-
ters in the expansion of Eq. (14), especially to z1
and z2, than to the energies of the states which are
used in the empirical MQDT analysis (see Ref. [42]).
To emphasize this point we have done a least square
ﬁt of the theoretical line positions for each state by
varying the center of gravity of the multiplet and
the mixing coeﬃcients z1 and z2 under the condition
1 + z2
z2
2 = constant. With only small changes of the
mixing coeﬃcients, which cause large eﬀects on the
hfs splitting, one can obtain a perfect agreement be-
tween experimental and theoretical line positions, as
is shown in Fig. 7. The optimized mixing coeﬃcients
diﬀer very little from the MQDT mixing coeﬃcients
except near n = 15, as can be seen in Fig. 8 and
Table 2. Therefore, in the following discussion it is
suﬃcient to use the MQDT mixing coeﬃcients for the
description of the main features of the hfs splitting.
The need for considering second order eﬀects for
the hfs becomes evident, when one tries to separate
the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contribu-
tions by ﬁtting the Casimir formula (which contains
only ﬁrst order eﬀects) to the measured and calcu-
lated hfs – splittings. This is shown in Fig. 9(a) and
9(b) and is listed in Table 4. At the ﬁrst glance an ex-
cellent agreement between experiment and theory is
obtained. However, the large constant B in Fig. 9(b)
does not describe the electric quadrupole interaction,

mental ones.

and reﬂects mainly the second order contribution of
the magnetic dipole interaction. The contribution of
the quadrupole interaction is very small indeed, and
is determined by the admixture of the 4dn′s conﬁg-
uration. This is shown in Fig. 9(c), where the elec-
tric quadrupole interaction is considered to ﬁrst order
only.

5.2 Isotope Shift

The inﬂuence of the second order eﬀects on the IS can
be seen in a King-plot analysis in Fig. 10. The King-
plot procedure (see Ref. [43]) can be used for testing
the consistency of the IS measurement in two tran-
sitions. It allows the separation of the speciﬁc mass
and the ﬁeld shift of a transition, provided the spe-
ciﬁc mass and the ﬁeld shift are known for a reference
transition. In a King-plot, the modiﬁed IS ξA,A
of a
transition i between two isotopes with mass numbers
A and A′ (where A′ > A) is plotted against the modi-
ﬁed IS ξA,A
of the reference transition. The modiﬁed
IS is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the experimen-
tal IS δνA,A
and the normal mass shift multiplied by
mA), where mA and mA′
the factor mAmA′/(mA′
are the masses of the isotopes :

Here me is the electron mass and νi the transition
energy. In a King-plot the points for diﬀerent isotope
pairs should lie on a straight line.
For the transitions 5s2 1S0 →

5snd 1D2 in Sr I
this is true only for the even isotope pairs. As an
example, Fig. 10 shows a King-plot for the transi-
tion Sr I 5s2 1S0 →
5s17d 1D2. The transition Sr II
5p 2P1/2 from Ref. [39] was taken as ref-
5s 2S1/2 →
erence transition. Obviously the points involving the
odd isotope 87Sr (which are calculated using the cen-
ter of gravity of the experimental hfs – splitting listed
in Table 4) are far oﬀ the linear dependence of the
even isotope pairs. This eﬀect was also noticed in
Ref. [18] for Ytterbium, where the deviation from a
straight line was taken to determine the magnitude
of the second order contributions. If one corrects the
experimental IS of the 87Sr for the second order con-
tribution to the shift, represented by the center of

Higher order contributions to the hfs and to the IS
have been studied for 87Sr 5snd 1D2 states in the
range 11
25. An enhanced accuracy, com-
pared to previous experiments, made it possible to
identify second order magnetic dipole contributions
to the hyperﬁne splitting and shift.

n

In parallel the hfs was calculated in second order
pertubation theory using MQDT wavefunctions. We
demonstrate that the knowledgement of second or-
der contributions is important for the determination
of the quadrupole splitting and the IS, even when
the ﬁne structure separation is large compared to the
hfs – splitting. Neglecting the second order contri-
butions in the hfs analysis of the experimental data
leads to unrealistically large quadrupole factors in the
Casimir formula as well as to erroneous positions of
the centers of gravity which do not give the correct
IS.

In the investigated region of n of the 5snd 1D2
states,
it was shown that the second order mag-
netic dipole contribution to the hfs – splitting is near
n = 15 up to one hundred times larger than the ﬁrst
order electric quadrupole contribution which is deter-
mined by small admixtures of doubly excited states.
Because of the dominance of the second order mag-
netic dipole contributions it was not possible to make
any reliable predictions, based on experimental data,
about the admixtures of doubly excited channels into
the wavefunction of the 5snd 1D2 states that could
signiﬁcantly improve the results of a MQDT-analysis.
Evaluating the IS from the 87Sr spectrum, corrected
for the second order contributions of the hfs to the
shift, leads to a value consistent with a King-plot
analysis.

volving 87Sr are corrected by an amount given by the
center of gravity of the theoretical hyperﬁne splitting
listed in Table 4.

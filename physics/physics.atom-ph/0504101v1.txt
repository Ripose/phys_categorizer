Abstract
We describe experiments with an optical frequency standard based on
a laser cooled 171Yb+ ion conﬁned in a radiofrequency Paul trap. The
electric-quadrupole transition from the 2S1/2(F = 0) ground state to the
2D3/2(F = 2) state at the wavelength of 436 nm is used as the reference tran-
sition. In order to compare two 171Yb+ standards, separate frequency servo
systems are employed to stabilize two probe laser frequencies to the reference
transition line centers of two independently stored ions. The experimental
results indicate a relative instability (Allan standard deviation) of the optical
frequency diﬀerence between the two systems of σy(1000 s) = 5 · 10−16 only,
so that shifts in the sub-hertz range can be resolved. Shifts of several hertz
are observed if a stationary electric ﬁeld gradient is superimposed on the ra-
diofrequency trap ﬁeld. The absolute optical transition frequency of Yb+ at
688 THz was measured with a cesium atomic clock at two times separated by
2.8 years. A temporal variation of this frequency can be excluded within a
1σ relative uncertainty of 4.4 · 10−15 yr−1. Combined with recently published
values for the constancy of other transition frequencies this measurement
provides a limit on the present variability of the ﬁne structure constant α at
the level of 2.0 · 10−15 yr−1.

1 Introduction

Time and frequency are presently by far the most precisely measurable physi-
cal quantities and optical atomic frequency standards hold great potential for
further improvements in stability and accuracy. A single trapped and laser
cooled ion can be used as a reference that oﬀers excellent control over possible
systematic eﬀects. Presently, a number of groups is pursuing research along
these lines with diﬀerent ions (see [1, 2] for recent reviews). High-resolution
spectroscopy and precise frequency measurements using femtosecond laser
frequency comb generators [3] have been performed with reference transi-
tions in Sr+ [4, 5], In+ [6, 7], Yb+ [8, 9, 10, 11] and Hg+ [12, 13].

In this paper we review two recent experiments at PTB with an optical
frequency standard based on the 171Yb+ ion: (i) frequency comparisons be-
tween two ions in separate traps are used to investigate the stability and to
evaluate systematic frequency shifts [14], (ii) a sequence of absolute optical
frequency measurements has been made using a cesium fountain clock in or-
der to test the reproducibility of the standard and to obtain a stringent limit
on a possible temporal variation of the ﬁne structure constant [15].

2 171Yb+ optical frequency standard

The 171Yb+ ion is attractive for an optical frequency standard because ref-
erence transitions with vanishing low-ﬁeld linear Zeeman frequency shift
are available in a level system with relatively simple hyperﬁne and mag-
netic sublevel structure (cf. Fig. 1a). The electric quadrupole transition
(2S1/2, F = 0) → (2D3/2, F = 2) at 436 nm wavelength can serve as the
reference transition, with a natural linewidth of 3.1 Hz. A single ytter-
bium ion is trapped in a miniature Paul trap and is laser-cooled to a sub-
millikelvin temperature by exciting the low-frequency wing of the quasi-cyclic
(F = 1) → (F = 0) component of the 2S1/2 → 2P1/2 resonance transition at
370 nm. A static magnetic ﬁeld of approximately 0.3 mT is applied in order
to prevent optical pumping to a nonabsorbing superposition of the magnetic
sublevels of the F = 1 ground state. The natural linewidth of this transition
is 21 MHz, which implies a one-dimensional kinetic temperature of 0.6 mK at
the Doppler cooling limit. A weak sideband of the cooling radiation provides
hyperﬁne repumping from the F = 0 ground state to the 2P1/2(F = 1) level.
At the end of each cooling phase, the hyperﬁne repumping is switched oﬀ in
order to prepare the ion in the F = 0 ground state. The rapid spontaneous
decay from the 2P1/2 state to the (F = 2) sublevel of the metastable 2D3/2
state that occurs during laser cooling is compensated for by coupling this
level with an additional laser at 935 nm wavelength to the [3/2]1/2(F = 1)
state, from where the ion readily returns to the ground state. The (F = 2)
sublevel of the 2D3/2 state is not rapidly populated or depleted by the laser

cooling excitation.
Individual quantum jumps to this state due to excita-
tion of the reference transition can therefore be detected using the electron
shelving scheme.

trum of the 2S1/2(F = 0, mF = 0) → 2D3/2(F = 2, mF = 0) transition,
obtained with 20 probe cycles for each value of the detuning. The linewidth
of 10 Hz is approximately at the Fourier limit for the employed probe pulses
of 90 ms duration.

The S − D electric quadrupole reference transition is probed by the fre-
quency doubled radiation from a diode laser emitting at 871 nm. The short
term frequency stability of this laser is derived from a temperature-stabilized
and seismically isolated high-ﬁnesse reference cavity. Figure 1b shows a high-
resolution excitation spectrum obtained with 90 ms long laser pulses, leading
to an approximately Fourier-limited linewidth in the range of 10 Hz, or a reso-
lution ∆ν/ν of 1.4·10−14. Since the duration of the probe pulse is longer than
the lifetime of the excited state (51 ms), the observed maximum excitation
probability is limited by spontaneous decay. In order to operate the system
as a frequency standard, both wings of the resonance are probed alternately,
and the probe light frequency is stabilized to the line center according to the
diﬀerence of the measured excitation probabilities.

3 Frequency comparisons between two trapped

ions

To enable a quantitative study of systematic frequency shifts on the sub-hertz
scale, we compare the line center frequencies of two 171Yb+ ions stored in sep-
arate traps. The scheme of the frequency comparison experiment is shown in
Fig. 2. Both traps use the same cooling laser setup and synchronous timing
schemes for cooling, state preparation, and state detection. The beam from

the probe laser is split and two separate frequency shift and servo systems are
employed to stabilize the probe frequencies to the reference transition line
centers of the two ions. The atomic resonance signal is probed in typically
eight excitation cycles until an error signal is calculated and the detunings
between the probe laser frequency and the probe light beams incident on the
traps are corrected. The servo time constants are in the range of 10 s. In
order to minimize servo errors due to the drift of the probe laser frequency,
a second-order integrating servo algorithm is used. The diﬀerences of the
detunings imparted on the probe beams are averaged over time intervals of
1 s and recorded. As a measure of the instability, the Allan deviation of a
typical data set is shown in Fig. 3. The result indicates a relative instability
of the frequency diﬀerence between the two systems of σy(1000 s) = 5 · 10−16.
The atomic resonance signals were resolved with Fourier-limited linewidths
of approximately 30 Hz in both traps. For averaging times that are longer
than the time constants of the servo systems, the so-called quantum projec-
tion noise [16] limits the instability. This contribution to the instability is
dominant because the state measurement is done on a single atom only. We
have performed a numerical calculation which simulates the eﬀect of quan-
tum projection noise for the realized experimental conditions and include the
result as the solid line in Fig. 3, showing good agreement with the measured
data.

The mean frequency diﬀerence between the two traps was generally in the
hertz or sub-hertz range for nominally unperturbed conditions [14]. The
dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the 171Yb+ optical frequency
standard is the so-called quadrupole shift of the atomic transition frequency.
It is due to the interaction of the electric quadrupole moment of the D3/2
state with the gradient of the static electric ﬁeld in the trap. In order to
experimentally determine the 171Yb+ quadrupole moment, a static ﬁeld gra-
dient was generated in one of the traps by superimposing a constant voltage

projection noise.

on the radiofrequency trap drive voltage. The orientation of this ﬁeld gra-
dient is determined by the symmetry axis of the trap. The other trap was
operated with a pure rf voltage and served as a reference. From this exper-
iment, we infer a quadrupole moment of Q = (3.9 ± 1.9)ea2
0 for the 2D3/2
level with e being the elementary charge and a0 the Bohr radius. The un-
certainty is mainly determined by the uncertainty of the measurement of the
angle between the magnetic ﬁeld and the trap axis. Depending on the orien-
tation, a ﬁeld gradient of 1 V/mm2 may produce a frequency shift of up to
6 Hz. Averaging the frequency over three orthogonal quantization axes – i.e.
axes of the magnetic ﬁeld – allows to determine the unperturbed transition
frequency [17].

4 Absolute frequency measurements

The absolute frequency of the 171Yb+ standard at 688 THz was measured
relative to a cesium fountain clock [18], using the setup shown schematically
in Fig. 4a. A hydrogen maser is referenced to the cesium clock and delivers a
signal at 100 MHz with a relative instability below 2 · 10−15 in 1000 s of aver-
aging. The link between the optical and microwave frequencies is established
with a femtosecond-laser frequency comb generator. The 171Yb+ frequency
was measured ﬁrst in December 2000 and January 2001. The result was
688 358 979 309 312 Hz with a total 1σ measurement uncertainty of 6 Hz [8].

ments of the 171Yb+ standard versus the date of the measurement (MJD:
Modiﬁed Julian Date).

In November 2003, the frequency was remeasured after improvements in the
resolution of the ionic resonance and in the frequency comb generator setup.
The new value has a total 1σ uncertainty of 6.2 Hz and is insigniﬁcantly lower
by 2.3 Hz. The dominant source of systematic uncertainty is the quadrupole
shift that may be produced by patch charges on the trap electrodes. The
static quadrupole potential associated with these charges will also alter the
oscillation frequencies of the ion in the trap. Measurements of the oscillation
frequencies allow to estimate the uncertainty due to the quadrupole shift as
3 Hz under the conditions of the experiment. The total uncertainty of 6.2 Hz
(corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 9 · 10−15) contains also a system-
atic contribution of 2.2 Hz from the microwave reference and frequency comb
generator and a total statistical contribution of 4.8 Hz.

From the sequence of absolute frequency measurements (cf. Fig. 4b) we
deduce a value for the fractional temporal variation of the frequency ratio
fYb/fCs of (−1.2 ± 4.4) · 10−15 yr−1, consistent with zero. This result can
be used to obtain a limit on the temporal variation of the ﬁne structure

constant.

5 Variations of fundamental constants

Discussions about a possible temporal variability of fundamental constants
of nature date back until the 1930s, with Dirac’s large number hypothesis
[19] being a prominent example. Meanwhile, strong motivation to search for
such an eﬀect has developed because theories that attempt to unify the fun-
damental interactions allow or even imply temporal variations of the coupling
constants (see e.g. [20]). Variations of the constants have been searched for in
various systems [21, 22]. Sommerfeld’s ﬁne-structure constant α = e2/4πǫ0¯hc
(composed of the elementary charge e, Planck’s constant ¯h, the speed of light
c, and the electric constant of vacuum ǫ0) is presently the most important
test case because it is the fundamental coupling constant of the electro-
magnetic interaction. As a dimensionless quantity α ≈ 1/137.036 can be
determined without reference to a speciﬁc system of units. This point is im-
portant because the realization of the units themselves may also be aﬀected
by variations of the constants.

An indication for a possible variation of α comes from a shift of wavelengths
of speciﬁc absorption lines produced by interstellar clouds in the light from
distant quasars [23]. These observations seem to suggest that about 1·1010 yr
ago the value of α was smaller than today by ∆α/α = (−0.543±0.116)·10−5,
representing 4.7σ evidence for a varying α [24]. Assuming a linear increase in
α with time, this would correspond to a drift rate ∂ ln α/∂t = (6.40 ± 1.35) ·
10−16 yr−1 [24]. Recent evaluations of new data on quasar absorption lines
are consistent with ∆α = 0 for all look-back times [25].

To perform a laboratory tests for the variability of α in the present epoch
one can compare diﬀerent electronic transition frequencies in the optical
range [26, 27]. For the analysis, we express the electronic transition fre-
quency as

f = Ry · C · F (α)
(1)
where Ry = mee4/(8ǫ0h3) ≃ 3.2898 · 1015 Hz is the Rydberg constant in
SI units of frequency, appearing here as the common atomic scaling factor.
C is a numerical constant which depends only on the quantum numbers
characterising the atomic state and which is independent of time. F (α)
is a dimensionless function of α that takes into account level shifts due to
relativistic eﬀects [28]. In many-electron atoms these eﬀects lead to diﬀerent
sensitivities of the transition frequencies to a change of α, with the general
trend to ﬁnd a stronger dependence in heavier atoms [29]. The relative
temporal derivative of the frequency f can be written as:

∂ ln f
∂t

=

∂ ln Ry
∂t

+ A · ∂ ln α
∂t

with A ≡ ∂ ln F
∂ ln α

.

(2)

7

The ﬁrst term ∂ ln Ry/∂t represents a variation that would be common to all
measurements of electronic transition frequencies: a change of the numerical
value of the Rydberg constant in SI units, i.e. with respect to the 133Cs hy-
perﬁne splitting. We distinguish here between the numerical value of Ry and
the physical parameter mee4/h2 which determines the atomic energy scale.
A change of the latter would not be detectable in this type of measurement
because the 133Cs hyperﬁne splitting also scales with this quantity. Conse-
quently, the detection of a non-zero value of ∂ ln Ry/∂t would have to be
interpreted as being related to a change of the nuclear magnetic moment of
133Cs. The second term in Eq. 2 is speciﬁc to the atomic transition under
study. The sensitivity factor A for small changes of α has been calculated
for a number of cases of interest by Dzuba, Flambaum et al. [28]. Assuming
that all possible drifts are linear in time over the duration of the frequency
comparisons, the fractional drift rate ∂ ln α/∂t can be obtained from at least
two measured drift rates of transition frequencies ∂ ln f /∂t if these have been
measured against a common reference, and if the sensitivity factors A for the
two transitions are diﬀerent.

To derive the limit on ∂ ln α/∂t we combine the data from 171Yb+ with
a published limit on the drift rate of a transition frequency in 199Hg+ [13],
obtained at NIST (Boulder, USA). In Hg+ the transition 5d106s 2S1/2 →
5d96s2 2D5/2 at 282 nm (1065 THz) with a natural linewidth of 1.9 Hz serves
as the reference. A ﬁrst absolute frequency measurement of this transition
with respect to a cesium clock was published in 2001 with an uncertainty of
9 · 10−15 [30]. A sequence of measurements over the period from August 2000
to November 2002 has resulted in a constraint for the fractional variation of
fHg/fCs at the level of 7 · 10−15 yr−1 (1σ) [13]. The sensitivities of the ytter-
bium and mercury transition frequencies to changes of α are quite diﬀerent:
AYb = 0.88 and AHg = −3.19 [28].

A further precision test for the constancy of an optical transition frequency
was presented by Fischer et al. who measured the 1S → 2S transition
frequency in atomic hydrogen in two periods in July 1999 and in February
2003, using a transportable cesium fountain frequency standard [31]. The
limit on the fractional drift rate for the hydrogen frequency that is deduced
from these experiments is (−3.2 ± 6.3) · 10−15 yr−1 [31] with the sensitivity
factor AH being zero.

Plotting the three limits on the frequency drift rates as a function of A
(Fig. 5a) and performing a weighted linear regression we obtain from the
slope of the ﬁt:

for the present value of the temporal derivative of the ﬁne structure constant
at the conﬁdence level of 1σ. This limit is based on a model-independent
analysis, not using assumptions on correlations between drift rates of diﬀerent

a non-zero time derivative of the ﬁne structure constant α. b) Constraints

quantities and not postulating the drift rate of any quantity to be zero. To
our knowledge, this is so far the most stringent limit on ∂α/∂t obtained from
atomic clock comparisons [15]. Another related analysis based on the data
from hydrogen and mercury is presented in [31].

The intercept of the straight line representing the dependence of the optical
frequency drift rate on A with the line A = 0 in Fig. 5a can be used to
determine the drift rate of the numerical value of the Rydberg frequency.
This quantity is of great metrological importance. A non-zero value would
imply among other consequences that a time scale generated with a cesium
clock would not be uniform with respect to other atomic oscillations. The
result that we obtain here is consistent with zero:

∂ ln Ry
∂t

= (−1.6 ± 3.2) · 10−15 yr−1.

Fig. 5b shows how the measurements of the three transition frequencies
contribute to the constraints on the temporal derivatives of α and Ry. The
central hatched area is bounded by the standard uncertainty ellipse (see Ref.
[15] for details).

With these results we reach a sensitivity for ∆α/∆t with ∆t ≈ 3 yr that
approaches that of the quasar observations [24, 25] to within about a factor
of three if a linear change of α is assumed on a cosmological time scale.
Further improvements in the data from clock comparisons can be expected
since trapped ions have the potential to reach relative uncertainties in the
range of 10−18 for the comparison of optical transition frequencies [1]. The
kind of analysis that we have applied here to the frequencies of the S → D
quadrupole transitions in 171Yb+ and 199Hg+ and of the 1S → 2S transition
in H may be extended to other atomic systems as soon as precision data on
frequency drift rates become available.

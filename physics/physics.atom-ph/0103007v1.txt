Abstract

Based upon our previous works ( Eur.Phys.J.D 6, 319(1999); Chin.Phys.Lett.

18, 236(2001)), we develop a classical approach to calculate the high-order

harmonic generation of the laser driven atoms and molecules. The Coulomb

singularities in the system have been removed by a regularization procedure.

Action-angle variables have been used to generate the initial microcanonical

distribution which satisﬁes the inversion symmetry of the system. The nu-

merical simulation show, within a proper laser intensity, a harmonic plateau

with only odd harmonics appears. At higher intensities, the spectra become

noisier because of the existence of chaos. With further increase in laser in-

tensity, ionization takes place, and the high-order harmonics disappear. Thus

chaos introduces noise in the spectra, and ionization suppresses the harmonic

I. INTRODUCTION

The development of the high-power femtosecond laser has stimulated the investigation of

the multi-photon processes of atoms and molecules interacting with intense laser ﬁelds [1-9].

Recently, there are many theoretical and experimental references about these multiphoton

process. Within a proper intensity region, lots of odd harmonics of laser are generated by

atomic and molecular gases [1-5,14]. The harmonic structure distributes as a plateau which is

cut oﬀ at a special high-order harmonic. When the intensity increases, the ionization channel

is opened and the high-order harmonics disappear. The above threshold ionization (ATI)

occurs when the laser intensity is suﬃcient power (above 1013W/cm2). Various structures

(plateau, angular distribution, etc.) in ATI spectra have been detailed in Ref.[6-8]. The

above threshold dissociation (ATD) and dissociation-ionization of molecular systems are

also reported [9-10]. Studying the laser-matter interaction deeply, not only can obtain new

knowledge of the interacting mechanism, but also can provide widely application in the

generation of high-order coherent harmonics, X-rays laser and γ-rays laser.

The classical dynamics of most laser-driven systems is generally chaotic, due to the ex-

istence of nonlinearity. Chaos usually manifests itself as some control parameters (initial

energy, laser intensity, laser frequency, etc.) are varied. The microscopic systems, in partic-

ular those involving atoms and molecules, are governed by a Hamiltonian. To study these

systems are of great importance in the context of quantum-classical correspondence. At the

investigated high power laser intensity (1013˜1015W/cm2), the electric ﬁeld of the laser is

equal in strength to the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nuclei [8], and the laser ﬁeld can not be looked

as a perturbation to the ﬁeld-free system, for the states themselves are no longer indepen-

dent of the laser. Generally, the microscopic systems (atoms or molecules) are intrinsically

quantum mechanical systems, thus they must be described by quantum mechanics. How-

ever, due to the presence of intense laser, the exact calculation even numerical simulation

based upon quantum mechanics tend to be very diﬃcult to perform. Fortunately, classical

approach to these similar problems is useful for providing physical insight into dynamics

3

processes [10-13]. Classical chaos associating with the microwave ionization of atomic hy-

drogen reveals that the detailed mechanism of atomic ionization in terms of transport in

phase space [11-12]. Classical prediction for scaled frequencies has been veriﬁed by quan-

tum calculations [12-13], and, in turn, has conﬁrmed the dynamical signiﬁcance of classical

chaos. The harmonic generation (HG) of laser driven hydrogen atoms is simulated with

classical Monte-Carlo method [14], the numerical results are qualitatively consistent with

the quantum mechanic results and the experimental observation. For the molecular systems,

the classical calculation is a good ﬁrst step, since length and energy scales are often large

enough for classical mechanics to be at least approximately valid. Using softened potential

model, the classical dynamics of the one-dimensional hydrogen molecular ion H +

2 interacting

with an intense laser pulse are detailed [15-16].

There are two important and realistic examples of laser driven systems, where nonlinear

dynamics has played a major role, which have been traditionally studied. One is the laser

driven hydrogen atom that is the fundamental system in atomic physics, the other is the laser

driven hydrogen molecular ion H +

2 , which is the fundamental diatomic molecular system in

molecular physics. Bellow, we shall show our classical calculation of the high-order harmonic

generation of these two fundamental systems. The outline of this paper is as follows. The

regularized model and the corresponding initial microcanonical distribution are presented in

the next section. In section III, we show the numerical results in details. A brieﬂy summary

and discussion is given out in the last section.

II. MODEL AND INITIAL MICROCANONICAL DISTRIBUTION

A. Regularized model of laser driven hydrogen atom

In this article, we consider a classical hydrogen atom, with an inﬁnite mass nucleus ﬁxed

at the origin of coordinates, interacting with a high intense laser ﬁeld which is linearly po-

larized along the z

axis, and with the electric ﬁeld component ε(t). Thus the Hamiltonian

x = uv cos φ, y = uv sin φ, z = (v2

−

and a new ﬁctive time scale τ

dt/dτ = G(u, v) = v2 + u2.

In order to implement regularization, following the notation of Szebenhely [17], regarding the

motion time t and the negative total energy

E as generalized coordinate and generalized

momentum respectively, then the Hamiltonian function in extended space becomes into

H ∗ = H

to the Coulomb attraction of both protons and the interaction of the laser. Let rA be its

where, ε(t) is the electric ﬁeld of the laser pulse, Hi is the interacting Hamiltonian. Ap-

parently, the above Hamiltonian has singularities at points rA = 0 and rB = 0, which

corresponds to electron-proton collision. To overcome this barrier, regularization has to be

performed. Deﬁne the new coordinates (u, v, φ) as

This means θ is the mean anomaly of the free orbits. The eccentric anomaly u can be

Generally, a single trajectory lacks the inversion symmetry of the real physical sys-

tems. So the spectrum obtained from a single trajectory exhibits unphysical even har-

monics. A natural way to remedy the unphysical even harmonics is to consider an en-

semble of trajectories, evolving from an initial microcanonical distribution with inver-

sion symmetry. For a chaotic system, the initial distribution can be generated with

Monte-Carlo method. However, for an integrable system, the distribution generated by

Monte-Carlo method does not possess of ergodicity. We ﬁnd that the points on the

same equienergy surface generated by action-angle variables with regular steps possess

of good ergodicity. To reconstruct the inversion symmetry, there must exist pairs of

(x0, y0, z0; px0, py0, pz0) and (

2 , it

corresponds to pairs of (u0, v0, φ0; pu0, pv0, pφ0) and (u0 + π, v0, φ0; pu0, pv0, pφ0).

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

The numerical computational procedure is based upon the classical trajectory Monte

Carlo (CTMC) method [20-21]. CTMC simulation procedure involves three stages, (i) choice

of initial conditions, (ii) numerical integration of equation of motion, and (iii) categorization

10

of each trajectory as excitation, charge transfer or ionization. In the process of numerical

integrating, numerical accuracy and computing time are two primary aspects that must be

considered. We use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with variable steps to perform

the numerical calculation. Note also that computer can not deal with singularity, which

corresponds to electron-nucleus collision, to overcome this diﬃculty, we have implemented

regularization. With complete regularization, numerical simulation can be established with

required precision before, at, and, after collision successfully.

To obtain the harmonic spectra, our procedure also calculate the averaged dipole moment

of the excited trajectories with pairs of inversion symmetric initial conditions in the same

distribution. Having determined the actual trajectories of the electron, one can easily obtain

the component of the averaged dipole moment, which along the laser polarization direction.

Then the harmonic spectra of the driven dipole is straightforwardly obtained from it’s power

and ωL is the angular frequency, and period TL is equal to 2π/ωL.

The time-dependent dipole moment µz(t) of a single trajectory along the laser polariza-

tion direction sensitively depends on the laser intensity. Fig.1 shows the time evolution of

the dipole of the hydrogen molecular ion with initial energy E0 =

1.1034 hatree, inter-

And some dipoles of the hydrogen atom and their power spectra are presented in Fig.2,

intensity. With the increasing of the laser intensity, the oscillations of the dipole moments

are modulated gradually, and it follows a regular pattern with both high and low frequency

components. Such patterns are independent of initial conditions. When the laser intensity is

large enough, ionization takes place, which strongly modiﬁes the subsequent time evolution

of the dipole moment.

The power spectra obtained from a single trajectory of the laser driven hydrogen molecu-

lar ion, which with initial energy E0 =

1.1034 hatree, internuclear distance R = 2.00 bohr,

−

laser wavelength λ = 600 nm and diﬀerent laser intensity, are presented in Fig.3. The ﬁrst

one corresponds to the ﬁeld-free case. For the hydrogen atom, it possesses of only regularly

decreasing peaks locating at multiples (harmonics) of Kepler’s frequency, that is, ωn = nω0,

for n = 1, 2, 3

, which manifests that the free motion is periodic. While for the hydrogen

· ··

molecular ion, the free motion is quasi-periodic, it appears regularly decreasing peaks locat-

ing at two diﬀerent characteristic frequencies and their combinations, i.e., at nω01 + mω02,

for n = 0, 1, 2, 3

, m = 0, 1, 2, 3

and n + m > 0. For the laser driven systems, the peaks

· ··

· ··

of harmonic spectra depend strongly on the laser intensity. In addition to the origin peaks,

a dominant line at the laser frequency ωL appears, which is the Rayleigh component in the

light scattered by the atoms and molecular ions. High-order harmonics, which consist of

both odd and even components, do appear in the spectra, and their orders and strengths

increase with the increasing of the laser intensity. For a low laser intensity, i.e., in the

perturbative regime, the characteristic peaks dominate the power spectrum. For a proper

laser intensity, the plateau structure containing both odd and even harmonics appears. For

a larger laser intensity, because of the presence of chaos, the spectra become noisier even

the motion is bound. For a strong enough laser intensity, the motion becomes unbound and

the corresponding spectrum is dominated by a very noise background, which is generated

by the ionized electrons, the only line surviving being the one at the laser frequency, which

corresponds to the light scattered by the asymptotically free electron Thomson scattering.

To eliminate the unphysical even harmonics, averaging an ensemble of trajectories evolv-

ing from an inversion symmetric distribution is necessary. The time evolution of the averaged

dipole, which evolve from a microcanonical ensemble of 5000 trajectories, are presented in

ﬁnd that the oscillation of the averaged dipole is smooth and it globally follows the laser

oscillation.

The spectra obtained from an ensemble of trajectories are showed in Fig.5 and Fig.6.

Fig.5 is the harmonic spectra of the ground-state hydrogen atoms interacting with the laser

pulses with λ = 532 nm and diﬀerent laser intensity. Fig.6 is harmonic spectra of the

R = 2.00 bohr, laser wavelength λ = 600 nm and diﬀerent laser intensity. As a consequence

of averaging process, the unphysical even harmonics are remedied really. Within a proper

laser intensity range, the plateau structure that only possesses of odd harmonics appears. As

pointed out previously, at a higher intensity, the spectra become noisier even the ionization

does not happen because of the eﬀects of chaos. This indicates that the chaos cause the

noise of the harmonic spectra. When the laser intensity is high enough, the ionization takes

place, thus the noise background conceals the high-order harmonics. This means that the

onset of ionization follows the onset of chaos and the ionization suppresses the harmonic

generation.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In summary, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and using the classical trajec-

tory method,we have calculated the high-order harmonic generation spectra of the hydrogen

atom and the hydrogen molecular ion interacting with ultrashort intense laser pulses. The

other multi-photon phenomena, such as multi-photon ionization and above threshold disso-

13

ciation, can also be simulated. In our subsequent calculations, the dynamics of the electron

is investigated by numerical integrating the equations of motion using regularized coordi-

nates. To eliminate the unphysical even harmonics of a single trajectory, averaging over an

ensemble of trajectories evolving from an initial microcanonical distribution with inversion

symmetry is necessary. Such distribution is constructed using action-angle variables. A

plateau structure in the spectra with only odd harmonics is observed within a proper laser

intensity range of about 1014 W/cm2. From our numerical results, we observe that the high

order harmonics are cut oﬀ at a special order harmonic. At higher laser intensities, chaos

introduces noise into the spectra even though the motion is still bound. Finally as the

intensity is further increased, ionization takes place, and the harmonics disappear.

These results are qualitatively consistent with recent quantum calculations [16] and ex-

perimental observations [1-5], but the cutoﬀ order Nm of the plateau structure is not precisely

consistent with formula Nm = (Ip + 3.17Up)/¯hωL[27], here, Ip is the ionization potential and

Up = e2E2

M /4meω2

L denotes the quiver energy or the ponderomotive energy of an electron.

As an example, when the laser intensity I = 1014 W/cm2 and wavelength λ = 600 nm,

the ionization potential Ip of the ground-state hydrogen molecular ion is 1.1034 hatree

(29.77eV = 14.50 ¯hωL), the quiver energy Up = 3.36eV (= 1.63 ¯hωL), then Nm = 19, and

when I = 7.5

1013 W/cm2, Nm = 18; however, from our simulation, the harmonic plateau

×

are both cut oﬀ at 17, and for very large intensity (above 1015 W/cm2) the high-order har-

monics are concealed by the noises. To obtain quantitative results, we have to integrate the

time-dependent Schr

..
odinger equation, this can be realized with the split-operator method

[22]. For the hydrogen molecular ion, within BOA, a proper internuclear distance R will

enhance the high-order harmonic generation[16], and it will be interesting to go beyond the

Born-Oppenheimer approximation to investigate what further interesting insights can be

obtained when the nuclear motion is taken into account [23-24].

In our model, we only consider the non-relativistic case with dipole approximation. When

the laser is suﬃciently intense, photoelectrons of relativistic energies can be produced, ne-

cessitating a fully relativistic treatment [25]. The dipole approximation is no longer valid,

14

and the magnetic ﬁeld is not only present, but acquires an importance similar to that of the

electric ﬁeld. And even before the appearance of the relativistic photoelectrons, the eﬀects

of the magnetic ﬁeld may be very important too [26]. Due to the wiggly motion and the

acceleration of the electron near the outermost turning points induced by the magnetic ﬁeld,

the cut-oﬀ order of the harmonic plateau maybe higher.

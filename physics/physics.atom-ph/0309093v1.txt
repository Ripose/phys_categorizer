Complete spectrum of exact interdimensional degeneracies for a quan-

tum N -body system in D-dimensions is presented by the method of gen-

eralized spherical harmonic polynomials. In an N -body system all the

states with angular momentum [µ + n] in (D − 2n) dimensions are degen-

erate where [µ] and D are given and n is an arbitrary integer if the repre-

sentation [µ + n] exists for the SO(D − 2n) group and D − 2n ≥ N . There

is an exceptional interdimensional degeneracy for an N -body system be-

tween the state with zero angular momentum in D = N − 1 dimensions

and the state with zero angular momentum in D = N + 1 dimensions.

For a quantum few-body system in D dimensions, one of the characteristic features

is the presence of exact interdimensional degeneracies. Perhaps ﬁrst noticed by Van

Vleck [1], an isomorphism exists between angular momentum l and dimension D such

that each unit increment in l is equivalent to two-unit increment in D for any central

force problem in D dimensions. For a two-body system (e.g. one-electron atom) states

related by the dimensional link D, l ↔ (D − 2), (l + 1) are exactly degenerate [2,3].

For three-body system (e.g.

two-electron atom) Herrick and Stillinger found exact

interdimensional degeneracies between the states 1,3P e and 1,3Do in D = 3 and the

states 3,1Se and 3,1P o in D = 5, respectively [3]. For a four-body system (e.g. three-

electron atom) Herrick [2] found an exceptional interdimensional degeneracy that the

triply excited 2p3 4S fermion state of the lithium atom is exactly degenerate with the

spinless boson 1s3 ground state for D = 5 (D = 5 was misprinted as D = 3 in Ref.

[2]). In 1961 Schwartz [4] proved by the recursion relation that for a three-body system

in three-dimensional space, any angular momentum state can be expanded in a com-

plete set of the independent bases whose number is ﬁnite. Recently, by the method of

the generalized Schwartz expansion [5,6], Dunn and Watson showed some exact inter-

dimensional degeneracies of two-electron system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space

[7,8]. To our knowledge, no theoretical method has yet dealt with interdimensional

degeneracies when N > 3.

Recently, we proved the Schwartz expansion again by the method of generalized

spherical harmonic polynomials, and presented a new development for separating com-

pletely the global rotational degrees of freedom from the internal ones for the N-body

Schr¨odinger equation in three-dimensional space [9] as well as in D dimensions [10,11].

We found a complete set of base functions for angular momentum in the system. Any

wave function with a given angular momentum can be expanded with respect to them

where the coeﬃcients, called the generalized radial functions, depend only upon the

internal variables. The generalized radial equations satisﬁed by the generalized radial

functions are derived from the Schr¨odinger equation without any approximation [9].

The exact interdimensional degeneracies in a three-body system [12] were obtained di-

rectly from the generalized radial equations. In this Letter we study interdimensional

degeneracies for an N-body system in D-dimensional space.

For a quantum N-body system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space, we denote the

position vectors and the masses of N particles by rk and by mk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N,

respectively. M =

k mk is the total mass. The Schr¨odinger equation for the N-body

system with a spherically symmetric potential V is

where R0 describes the position of the center of mass, R1 describes the mass-weighted

separation from the second particle to the ﬁrst particle, R2 describes the mass-weighted

separation from the third particle to the center of mass of the ﬁrst two particles, and

so on. In the center-of-mass frame, R0 = 0, the N-body Schr¨odinger equation reduces

to a diﬀerential equation with respect to (N − 1) Jacobi coordinate vectors Rj:

where [µ] stands for the angular momentum as discussed later.

In a D-dimensional space it needs (D − 1) vectors to determine the body-ﬁxed

frame. When D ≥ N, all Jacobi coordinate vectors are used to determine the body-

ﬁxed frame, and all internal variables can be chosen as

ξjk = Rj · Rk,

1 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ N − 1.

(4)

We call the set of internal variables (4) the ﬁrst set. The numbers of the rotational

variables and the internal variables are (N −1)(2D−N)/2 and N(N −1)/2, respectively.

When D < N, only (D − 1) Jacobi coordinate vectors are involved to determine the

body-ﬁxed frame, and the ﬁrst set of internal variables is not complete because it could

not distinguish two conﬁgurations with diﬀerent directions of, say RD reﬂecting to the

superplane spanned by the ﬁrst (D − 1) Jacobi coordinate vectors. In this case we need

to use the second set of internal variables:

The numbers of the rotational variables and the internal variables are D(D − 1)/2 and

D(2N − D − 1)/2, respectively.

For an N-body system in D-dimensions, the angular momentum is described by an

irreducible representation of SO(D). When D ≥ N the irreducible representation is

denoted by an (N − 1)-row Young pattern [µ] ≡ [µ1, µ2, . . . , µN −1], µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥

µN −1. Due to the traceless condition, the representation [µ] of SO(D) exists only if the

sum of boxes of the ﬁrst two columns on the left of the Young pattern [µ] is not larger

than D. Some selfdual representations, antiselfdual ones, and the equivalent ones may

occur when N ≤ D ≤ 2(N − 1). They only change the explicit forms of the base

functions. The reader is suggested to refer our previous paper for detail [11].

Due to the rotational symmetry, one only needs to discuss the eigenfunctions of

angular momentum with the highest weight. The independent base function for the
angular momentum [µ] with the highest weight is Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) where (q) contains
(N −1)(N −2)/2 parameters qjk, 1 ≤ k ≤ j ≤ N −2, and determines a standard Young

tableau. A Young tableau is obtained by ﬁlling the digits 1, 2, . . ., N − 1 arbitrarily

into a given (N − 1)-row Young pattern [µ]. A Young tableau is called standard if

the digit in every column of the tableau increases downwards and the digit in every

row does not decrease from left to right. The parameter qjk denotes the number of the

digit ”j” in the kth row of the standard Young tableau. qjk should satisfy the following

constraints:

(6)

The number of the independent base functions Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) is equal to the di-
mension d[µ][SU(N − 1)] of the irreducible representation [µ] of the SU(N − 1) group.

The explicit form of Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) for the given standard Young tableau (q) is
very easy to write. In the Young tableau, in correspondence to each column with the
length t, ﬁlled by digits j1 < j2 < . . . < jt, Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) contains a determinant
as a factor. The rth row and sth column in the determinant is Rjr(2s−1) +iRjr(2s), where
Rja is the ath component of Rj, if D > 2(N − 1). Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) also contains a
numerical coeﬃcient for convenience. When N ≤ D ≤ 2(N − 1), the explicit form of

4

Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) is a little bit changed [11], but it will not aﬀect the generalized radial
equations as well as the interdimensional degeneracies. When D < N, only the ﬁrst
(D −1) Jacobi coordinate vectors are involved in the base functions Q[µ]
which are the same as those for smaller N = D. Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RD−1),
(q)(R1, . . . RN −1) is a homogeneous

and Q[µ+n]

There is a one-to-one correspondence between base functions Q[µ]

(q)(R1, . . . RN −1)
(q′) (R1, . . . RN −1), where [µ] ≡ [µ1, . . . , µN −1], [µ + n] ≡ [µ1 + n, . . . , µN −1 + n],
jk = qjk + nδjk. As a matter of fact, each standard Young tableau for [µ + n] can

and q′

be obtained from a corresponding standard Young tableau for [µ] by adhering from

its left n columns with N − 1 rows where the boxes in the jth row are ﬁlled with j,

1 ≤ j ≤ N − 1. From viewpoint of group theory, two representation [µ] and [µ + n]

of SU(N − 1) are equivalent to each other and their dimensions d[µ+n][SU(N − 1)] =

d[µ][SU(N − 1)].

When D ≥ N, any wave function Ψ[µ]

M(R1, . . . , RN −1) with the given angular mo-

mentum [µ] can be expanded with respect to the complete and independent base func-

into the N-body Schr¨odinger equation (3), one is able to obtain the generalized radial

From the above proof we come to the conclusion for the complete spectrum of the

exact interdimensional degeneracies for an arbitrary N-body system with a spherically

symmetric potential that all the states in the system with the angular momentum

[µ + n] in (D − 2n) dimensions are degenerate where [µ] and D are given and n is

an arbitrary integer if the representation [µ + n] exists for the SO(D − 2n) group and

D − 2n ≥ N, because those states are described by the wave functions with the same

number of the generalized radial functions depending upon the same set of internal

variables and satisfying the same generalized radial equations.

Now, we turn to discuss the case of D < N. The base functions and the internal

variables for D < N depend upon D and are very diﬀerent to those for D ≥ N [9,11]

so that, generally speaking, there is no interdimensional degeneracy when D < N but

(q)(R1, . . . , RN −1) as Q0. Note that Q0 corresponds to a standard
Young pattern of one column with D rows describing the identity representation of

SO(D). Due to the traceless condition the Young pattern for Q0 is the only Young

pattern with D rows for SO(D).

ζ 2
D can be expressed by the ﬁrst set of internal

variables. If a wave function with zero angular momentum for an N-body system in

D = N − 1 dimensions can be expressed as a product of ζD and a function f (ξjk, ζ 2

D),

we can rewrite it as a product of a base function Q0 and a generalized radial function

depending upon the ﬁrst set of internal variables. Thus, we compare this state with

the state of zero angular momentum in D = N + 1 dimensions, the number of the gen-

eralized radial function (one), the internal variables (the ﬁrst set), and the generalized

radial equation (see the proof for the cases of D ≥ N) are all the same, respectively.

Therefore, we obtain an exceptional interdimensional degeneracy between these two

states.

In this Letter we have provided a systematic procedure for analysis of observed

degeneracies among diﬀerent states in diﬀerent dimensions and yielded considerable

insight into the energy spectra of an N-body system. Since the generalized radial

equations for a quantum N-body system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space with

a spherically symmetric potential V are derived without any approximation [11], the

interdimensional degeneracies given here are exact and general.

Abstract

The current theoretical status of the Lamb shift in He+ is discussed. Recent calculations of two-
loop binding corrections to the Lamb shift signiﬁcantly shift the theoretical value of the “classic”
Lamb shift in He+, i.e. of the 2S1/2–2P1/2-interval. In this brief research note, we present a new
(theoretical) value for this interval which reads 14041.474(42) Mhz. The theoretical uncertainty
is reduced as well as the discrepancy between theory and experiment. Planned measurements
should be of help in further elucidating the situation.

1

Introduction

One of the intriguing questions which remain to be answered in bound-state quantum electrodynamics
is related to the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values for the Lamb shift in
ionized helium, or He+, which is a hydrogenlike atomic system with a nuclear charge number Z = 2.
The latest measurement of the “classical” Lamb shift in He+, using the anisotropy method, has led
to the result [1]

νexp(2S1/2 − 2P1/2) = 14041.13(17) MHz .

The theoretical value given in [2] is diﬀerent:

νth,old(2S1/2 − 2P1/2) = 14041.57(8) MHz ,

where the uncertainty has been assigned according to an estimate of the magnitude of higher-order
contributions which had been unknown. If these higher unknown terms had turned out to increase
rather than decrease the value of the Lamb shift, then a 3.0 σ discrepancy between theory and experi-
ment could have arisen. In the current paper, we review a shift in the theoretical value due to recently
calculated higher-order two-loop self-energy corrections, and a further shift due to radiative-recoil
corrections where a certain discrepancy between conﬂicting results has recently been eliminated.

Bound-state quantum electrodynamic (QED) energy shifts may be expressed as combined perturbation
series in the parameter α, which is the ﬁne-structure constant, and in Zα, which is a measure of the
electron-nucleus interaction. Although Lamb-shift measurements in atomic hydrogen (Z = 1) have
a long history, it is necessary to perform at least one measurement for a diﬀerent value of Z in
order to test the Z-dependence of the corrections, which are generated by bound-state eﬀects and are
fundamentally diﬀerent from the QED of free electrons. In He+, we have Z = 2, and the series in Zα
converge much slower than for Z = 1 (atomic hydrogen).
A more accurate measurement of the Lamb shift in He+ is currently being pursued by Hinds and
Boshier [3]. It is perhaps worthwhile to note that He+, as it constitutes an ionic system, should also

be an attractive candidate for high-precision laser-spectroscopic measurements in traps, where the
small Doppler shifts associated with the slow movement of the trapped ion could provide a basis for
a further signiﬁcant reduction in the experimental uncertainty.

2 Evaluation of Higher-Order Corrections

A detailed summary of radiative corrections which contribute to the Lamb shift of n = 2 states in
He+ has been given in Table I of[1]. Recently, the understanding of two-loop binding corrections to
the Lamb shift of S states has been signiﬁcantly enhanced [2]. Terms of order

have been evaluated. [Here, me is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, and the energy shift can
be converted to frequencies via division by the natural unit of action, which is Planck’s constant h. In
the following, we use a system of units in which ~ = ǫ0 = c = 1. We will also use the notations m and
me for the electron mass interchangeably [1], and by M , we denote the mass of the α particle.] These
coeﬃcients involve contributions originating from two-loop self-energy, combined self-energy vacuum-
polarization, and two-loop vacuum-polarization diagrams. The ﬁnal results [2] read as follows,

The quantity N (nS) results from a correction to the Bethe logarithm induced by a local potential,
and has been given for excited states in [4].
In particular, we have N (2S) = 12.032 209(1) and
B61(2S) = 42.447 669(1). This is a 15 % deviation from the corresponding result for 1S [2] which
is indicated here in equation (7a). The B61-correction, for 2S, therefore does not quite enhance the
2S1/2-2P1/2 interval as much as might be expected from the corresponding result for the 1S state
[equation (7a)].

n for S states. On the abscissa, we have the principal quantum number n,
and the ordinate axis represents the numerical values of B62(nS) as given in
equation (4). The smooth curve results from a three-parameter ﬁt with a model
of the form a + b/n + c/n2 (the quantities a, b, and c are ﬁt parameters). A
model of this form has been shown to lead to a satisfactory representation of
the n-dependence of quantum electrodynamic radiative corrections in many
cases (see [4] and references therein). The coeﬃcient B62 changes sign between
n = 1 and n = 2.

Additionally, we note that the recently available [5] nonlogarithmic two-loop terms of order

result in a negative energy shift for S states and that the B60-coeﬃcients are surprisingly large,

Here, the uncertainty is mainly due to an unknown high-energy contribution to this coeﬃcient.

Recent progress has also been reported with regard to recoil corrections of ﬁrst order in the mass
ratio me/M , where M is the mass of the atomic nucleus. For hydrogenic systems, a nonperturbative
evaluation to all orders in Zα has been performed in [6], and the results are in agreement with the
known terms of the Zα-expansion of this eﬀect. These are as follows: in the order (Zα)5 (me/M ) me c2,
we have the Salpeter correction. In relative order (Zα), we have a correction obtained by Pachucki and
Grotch [7]. Finally, in relative order (Zα)2 ln2[(Zα)−2], we have a further correction recently obtained
by Pachucki and Karshenboim, and Melnikov and Yelkhovsky [8, 9]. The sum of these corrections,
evaluated for Z = 2, leads to a satisfactory agreement with the numerical data published in [6] for the
entire range 1 < Z ≤ 100. The nonperturbative (in Zα) remainder can conservatively be estimated
as 3 kHz, which is three times the magnitude of the term of order (Zα)2 ln2[(Zα)−2] (see [8, 9]). This
term is not the main source of the theoretical uncertainty.
A discrepancy in the analysis of radiative-recoil corrections of order α (Zα)5 (me/M ) me c2 has re-
cently been resolved. According to the fully analytic calculation [10], the coeﬃcient multiplying this
term has the value −1.324 028/n3 for S states (here, n is the principal quantum number). In [7], a
slightly diﬀerent coeﬃcient of −1.374/n3 had been obtained, whereas in [11, 12, 13], a coeﬃcient of
−1.988(4) has been given. Assuming the correctness of the most recent evaluation [10], the result
for radiative-recoil corrections of order α (Zα)5 (me/M ) me c2 should be taken as −0.014 MHz rather

3

than −0.035 MHz. This concerns the entry termed “α (Zα)5 m/M ” in Table I of [1] which, in units
of α me c2, is of relative order (Zα)5 me/M .
Finally, we note that the uncertainty due to the nonperturbative (in Zα) one-loop self-energy re-
mainder GSE(Zα) has recently been eliminated [14]: the numerical result reads GSE(2S1/2, 2α) =
−30.644 66(5). For the 2S state of He+, the following energy shifts result from the results reported in
equations (4)–(9):

B62(2S) → +0.037 MHz

B61(2S) → +0.289 MHz

(entry termed α (Zα)6 ln2(Zα)−2 in Table I of [1]) ,

(entry termed α (Zα)6 ln(Zα)−2 in Table I of [1]) ,

B60(2S) → (−0.043 ± 0.006) MHz

(entry termed α (Zα)6 in Table I of

[1]) ,

radiative recoil → −0.014 MHz

GSE(2S1/2, 2α) → −10.624 MHz

[1]) ,

(entry termed (Zα)6 GSE(Zα) in Table I of [1]) ,

For completeness, we should also note slight inconsistencies in the notation of the corrections in [1].
First, in Table I of [1], all corrections are given in units of α me c2. The Salpeter correction has inad-
vertently been termed “(Zα)5 m/M ” whereas in units of α me c2, it should be termed “Z (Zα)4 m/M .”
Correspondingly, the correction denoted “(Zα)6 me c2” should actually be termed “Z (Zα)5 m/M ”,
and the correction denoted as “(Zα)7 ln(Zα) m/M ” is of course a correction of (relative) order
“Z (Zα)6 ln(Zα) m/M .”

We now discuss the main source of the theoretical uncertainty. There exists an essentially unknown
three-loop binding correction of order

(cid:16)

n3

α
π (cid:17)
where we note that the C50-coeﬃcient,
in analogy to the two-loop binding correction B50 ≈
−21.5562(31), might be numerically large. With the estimate |C50| ≈ 30 for the unknown term,
the corresponding additional uncertainty for the 2S state is 0.008 MHz. The nuclear-size contribution
to the uncertainty is 0.010 MHz [15, 1] (this is assuming a nuclear radius of 1.673(1) fm). There is
an additional 0.015 MHz uncertainty due to unknown higher-order two-loop corrections for 2P states.
We obtain the following theoretical error budget for the theoretical value of the Lamb shift in He+:

C50(nS) ,

(11)

• unknown high-energy part of B60: 6 kHz.

• unknown higher-order two-loop eﬀects for P states: 15 kHz.

• unknown three-loop binding correction C50: 8 kHz.

• nonperturbative remainder of nuclear recoil: 3 kHz.

• uncertainty in the nuclear charge radius: 10 kHz.

The α particle charge radius has been determined to high accuracy in [15], using spectroscopic ex-
perimental data from the system µ−–He2+. However, the accuracy of the resulting charge radius
of 1.673(1) fm has been questioned (see e.g. [16, 17]). The result obtained in combining scattering
experiments is 1.674(12) fm [18] and has a considerably larger error. The above entry in the error

4

budget should therefore rather be interpreted as a lower limit of this problematic contribution. Be-
cause theoretical errors cannot be expected to follow a normal distribution like experimental errors,
there exists no universally adopted procedure for the determination of a total theoretical error in a
situation where several unknown terms contribute to an error budget. In the current work, we choose
to (conservatively) add the above errors in order to obtain a total theoretical uncertainty of 42 kHz. To
complete the discussion, we mention that (i) under the assumption of normally distributed theoretical
errors, the total theoretical uncertainty would be reduced to 20 kHz, and (ii) under the assumption
of a 0.012 fm uncertainty in the nuclear radius [18], the theoretical error due to the α particle charge
radius alone would be 126 kHz.

3 Conclusions

We have re-evaluated theoretical predictions for the 2S–2P1/2 Lamb shift in He+. Taking into account
recently evaluated corrections to the entries in Table I of [1] (see equation (10)), we obtain the new
theoretical value of

νth(2S1/2 − 2P1/2) = 14041.474(42)(126) MHz ,

(12a)

where the ﬁrst error is due to the error budget as discussed above, and the second error results due to
the nuclear size alone, if we assign a larger nuclear charge radius uncertainty of 0.012 fm [18] instead
of 0.001 fm [15]. For the 2P3/2–2S1/2-interval, the new theoretical prediction is

νth(2P3/2 − 2S1/2) = 161542.029(42)(126) MHz ,

(12b)

with the same error budgets as for 2S1/2 − 2P1/2.
There remains a small discrepancy between the “new” theoretical value of 14041.474(42) MHz (equa-
tion (12a)) and the experimental result of 14041.13(17) MHz given in equation (1). However, this
discrepancy is less severe than the diﬀerence of the experimental value (1) and the “old” theoretical
value of 14041.57(8) MHz (see equation (2)).

The sum of the experimental (= 0.17 MHz) and the theoretical uncertainty (= 0.04 MHz) is σ =
0.21 MHz. This should be compared to the diﬀerence δ = 0.34 MHz between the theoretical and
experimental “expectation values” (12a) and (1). The diﬀerence δ corresponds to 1.6 σ. If we assign
the larger error of 0.012 fm to the nuclear radius, then the discrepancy shrinks to 1.2 σ.

Even though a diﬀerence of 1.2 σ to 1.6 σ between theory and experiment remains somewhat unsettling,
it is not large enough to be regarded as statistically signiﬁcant. Even at this level, it still represents
a better test of the unexpectedly large B50 two-loop binding correction to the Lamb shift (–1.339
MHz) than that provided by the corresponding measurement in hydrogen. In addition, the anisotropy
method provides a completely independent method of measuring the Lamb shift that is not limited
by the large level width of the 2P state(s), and it is the only method that is capable of comparing two
diﬀerent atomic or ionic species (H and He+, c.f. Ref. [19]) within the same apparatus.

It may also be beneﬁcial, in the near future, to re-analyze the results of the most recent measurement [1]

absolute frequency of the 2S–2P transitions. Further clariﬁcation of this and related questions will
certainly beneﬁt from a reduction of the experimental uncertainty of the Lamb-shift measurement to
±100 kHz or better, as is currently being pursued by Hinds and Boshier [3]. Finally, we stress that
all theoretical predictions for transitions in He+ rely on the single available accurate determination of
the charge radius of the α-particle as described in [15]. There is still a lack of accurate independent
veriﬁcations of this determination of the charge radius. In the end, the answer to a number of questions
related to Lamb-shift measurements in atomic hydrogen and He+ might be as easy as a slight deviation
of the proton and α particle charge radii from their currently accepted values. However, other, more
subtle explanations cannot be ruled out at present, either.

Abstract

Benzene, with its sea of delocalized π-electrons in the valence orbitals, is
identiﬁed as an example of a class of molecules that enable establishment of
the correspondence between intense ion-induced and laser-light-induced ﬁelds
in experiments that probe ionization dynamics in temporal regimes spanning
the attosecond and picosecond ranges.

Matter is inherently unstable when exposed to electric ﬁelds whose magnitudes approxi-
mate interatomic Coulombic ﬁelds. Studies of the response of matter to very intense ﬂuxes
of such ﬁelds address fundamental issues concerning the physics of systems driven strongly
away from equilibrium. There are two approaches that enable terrestrial access to such
ﬁelds, and their use in probing the ionization (and dissociation) dynamics of atoms (and
molecules): use of fast, highly-charged beams of heavy ions on the one hand, and focused,
intense laser light on the other. The equivalence of the two approaches has only been ex-
plored in somewhat desultory fashion. The interaction of atoms and molecules with intense
ﬁelds is clearly a complex nonperturbative, dynamical problem and prospects of rigorous
theoretical treatment remain remote. Experimental information, albeit of a morphologial
nature, is, therefore, of considerable importance and interest. Speciﬁcally, it is necessary
to identify a class of target species whose properties make them suitable for studies aimed
at disentangling the important time-dependent aspects of the ﬁeld-target interaction from
those that are ’static’ or structure-dependent, so that the prospects of gaining qualitative
insights are improved. The time-dependent aspect of the ﬁeld-target interaction is especially
of relevance in the case of molecules. Contemporary laser technology makes available intense
light ﬁelds in pulses of picosecond (ps) and femtosecond (f s) duration. For molecules, these
time scales are of signiﬁcance in relation to typical rotational and vibrational time periods
(tens of ps and tens of f s, respectively). In the case of ion-induced ﬁelds, however, a beam
of highly-charged ions traverses a distance of a few ˚A in only a few tens of attoseconds as,
thereby opening prospects of studies of molecular dynamics on times scales in which even
vibrational motions can be regarded as “frozen”. Moreover, these ultrashort times imply
enormous uncertainties in energies, thereby opening new avenues of molecular dynamics
studies that fall well outside the ambit of conventional molecular quantum mechanics. We
report in this Letter results of a study that suggests that benzene, with its sea of delocalized
π-electrons in the valence orbitals, constitutes a molecule that enables establishment of the
correspondence between intense ion-induced and laser-light-induced ﬁelds in experimental
probes of the ionization dynamics in temporal regimes that span the as and ps ranges.

The correspondence between ion-induced and light-induced ﬁelds can most usefully be
established by considering three temporal regimes.
In the case of relativistic ion beams
(whose energy∼GeV/nucleon, β=v/c ∼1) colliding with atoms or molecules, the Weizs¨acker-
Williams equivalent photon model [1] transforms the Coulombic ﬁeld in the projectile’s rest
frame to the target’s rest frame, and equates the eﬀect of the ﬁeld to two, orthogonally-
directed photon pulses. Application of such equivalent-photon pulses to atomic ionization
have recently attracted attention [2]. At the opposite temporal extreme, purely electrostatic
considerations use Coulomb’s law; for instance, in the case of Si3+ projectiles, a target atom
experiences a ﬁeld of magnitude ∼5 V ˚A
(∼0.1 a.u.) at a distance of 3 ˚A. In the inter-
mediate regime, one that is experimentally most accessible using highly-charged ion beams
of MeV energy, the eﬀective ion-induced electric ﬁeld experienced by a target may be de-
| ~E(t) × ~B(t)|. Following the pioneering work of
duced from the Poynting vector: Ief f (t) = 1
µ0
Rhodes and coworkers in this regime [3], recent work has focused on observing similarities
and diﬀerences between ion-induced and laser-induced ionization patterns in molecules like
water and chloromethanes of diﬀerent symmetries [4]. For H2O, the morphology of the dis-
sociative ionization pattern was found to be grossly diﬀerent in the two cases. Diﬀerences in
the case of the chloromethanes were much less, but were still signiﬁcant. These diﬀerences

−1

may be rationalized either by noting that the directional properties of the applied ﬁeld are
diﬀerent in the two cases, or by invoking the diﬀerent temporal proﬁles of the applied ﬁelds.
Although the magnitudes of the ion-induced and light-induced ﬁelds were almost identical
in these experiments, the directional properties of the two types of ﬁeld were diﬀerent in
the following sense: the laser light was linearly-polarized and so, the direction of the light-
induced ﬁeld was constant in the course of the interaction, unlike the time-dependence that
is intrinsic to the direction of the ion-induced ﬁeld. There is some evidence that, in the case
of laser-molecule interactions, the directional properties of the applied ﬁeld can inﬂuence
molecular dissociation pathways [5]. Other factors, such as indirect ionization events (in-
volving intermediate electron capture and loss) in the case of the ion-impact experiments,
can be discounted by judicious choice of collision energy (and, as indicated below, by sup-
plementary measurements made, under identical operating conditions, on well-understood
collision systems involving rare-gas targets).

Before presenting results that demonstrate the good correspondence between ion-induced
and light-induced ionization patterns of C6H6, it is important to address other facets of the
equivalence we explore, namely the peak ﬁeld intensity and the temporal/spatial features for
the two types of ﬁelds. Our ion-impact experiments used fast beams of mass-selected, highly-
charged ions (Siq+, q=3,8 at an energy of 50-100 MeV) that were obtained from a tandem
accelerator. Slow recoil ions resulting from large impact-parameter interactions between the
projectile ions and C6H6 vapor were extracted, with unit collection eﬃciency, into a linear
time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer located in a direction that was orthogonal to the incident
ion beam. The methodology has been described previously [4]. Experiments were also
performed with F7+ projectiles at an energy of 110 MeV, and in these the ion analysis and
detection was with quadrupole mass ﬁlter (all other experimental features being similar). In
the laser-based experiments, light pulses (of 35 ps and 100 fs duration), from high-intensity
Nd:YAG and Ti:sapphire lasers, were focused by a biconvex lens of 10 cm focal length such
that peak intensities within the focal volume were in the range 1012-1016 W cm−2.
Ions
produced in the focal volume were extracted, again at 90◦ to the incident laser beam, and
analyzed by a 2-ﬁeld TOF set-up.

One important facet of the comparison of ion-induced and light-induced ionization dy-
namics is the quantiﬁcation of the peak magnitude of the applied ﬁeld. A limiting value
of the impact parameter, b, has to be deduced for each ion-collision system. However, for
molecular targets, b remains a somewhat elusive parameter. The range of b-values that come
into play manifests itself in the mean recoil energy (Er) that is imparted to each molecular
ion that is created in the interaction. This, in turn, is reﬂected in the temporal width of
molecualar ion peaks in the measured TOF spectrum. In the case of C6H +
6 ions formed in
our experiments with Siq+ (q=3,8) projectiles, we measured Er to lie in the range 30-40 meV.
There is an established method [6], based on classical trajectory Monte-Carlo techniques [7],
that enables deductions to be made of the impact parameter dependence of multiple ioniza-
tion probabilities in fast-ion collisions. A value of 3 ˚A was deduced as the lower limit for
b in our experiments. Collisions that occur at smaller b-values give rise to recoil energies
far in excess of Er, and these are discriminated against by the angular resolution of the
spectrometers used by us. We conﬁrmed the veracity of our deductions of b by determining
total cross sections for formation of low-energy Arq+ recoils (q=1-10) in the same apparatus.
Deduction of b can also be complicated by electron capture and loss processes that might

3

inﬂuence the formation of recoils in charge state q >1. However, it was conﬁrmed that for a
range of ions (namely, Siq+, q=3-12), direct ionization dominated the overall dynamics. By
way of example, we cite the measured the total cross section for Ar4+ formation in Si10+-Ar
collisions to be 8×10−17 cm2; corresponding cross sections for Ar4+ formation accompanied
by 1-electron capture and loss were 3×10−18 cm2 and 7×10−19 cm2, respectively. For C6H6-
ion collisions at 50-110 MeV, the domination of direct ionization processes is likely to be
even more pronounced.

For the light-ﬁeld experiments, determination of the peak ﬁeld value is somewhat less
diﬃcult, but note the following facet that has hitherto not been widely acknowledged. Just
as the ion-C6H6 interaction accesses a range of b-values (b >3 ˚A), and, hence, exposes the
molecules in the interaction zone to a corresponding range of applied ﬁelds, so in the laser
case there is a spatial distribution of intensities that gives rise to a corresponding distribution
of ﬁelds. Such spatial distribution of the laser-induced ﬁeld, and the ion distribution that
results from it, was measured using a method that has recently been described in detail [8].
The spatial ﬁeld distributions obtained in both the ion-impact and laser-based experiments
are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. For convenience of comparison, we express the ﬁeld
magnitude obtained in the ion-impact experiments in terms of an eﬀective intensity that
can be directly compared with an easily-determined parameter in the laser experiments,
namely the light intensity. Judicious choice of operating conditions enable the spatial ﬁeld
distributions to be very similar in the two sets of experiments. The examples shown are for
a 100-MeV beam of Si8+ ions, readily accessed in tandem accelerators, and for a 100-fs long
laser pulse of peak intensity 2×1015 W cm−2, accessed by focusing a 1 mJ beam of 806 nm
wavelength from a Ti:sapphire laser to a spot size of ∼25 µm.

Fig. 3 shows typical ionic fragmentation patterns obtained when C6H6 is irradiated by
100-MeV Si3+ ions and 35-ps-long laser pulses of 532 nm wavelength. The peak intensity
in the latter case was ∼8×1013 W cm−2 and, by using a small (2 mm) aperture at the
entrance of our TOF spectrometer, the lower part of the intensity range that we accessed
was ∼5×1012 W cm−2. In the case of the ion impact data, the peak value of eﬀective intensity
at an impact parameter of 3 ˚A was ∼5×1014 W cm−2. We also conducted experiments with
Si8+ and F7+ ions, and with 100-fs duration laser pulses (of 806 nm wavelength), with peak
intensities in the range 1013-5×1016 W cm−2. The gross features of the measured ionic
fragmentation patterns remained essentially unaltered under all these conditions, although
the highest laser intensities gave rise to a larger degree of multiple ionization (that could also
be directly correlated with ion beam data). Illustrative data are shown in Fig. 4, for 110
MeV Si8+ impact and irradiation by 100fs laser pulses of intensity 5×1015 W cm−2. Here,
a larger (15 mm) aperture was used at the entrance of our TOF spectrometer in our laser
experiments, thereby giving access to the entire intensity range shown in Fig. 2. Recent
work [8] has shown that the lower-intensity portions of this range dominate the overall
dynamics because a very much larger proportion of the focal volume that is accessed by the
spectrometer samples the lowest intensities. Under these circumstances, the contribution of
the parent C6H +
ion to the mas spectrum is very much enhanced (not shown in the ﬁgure).
The central portion of the focal volume samples the peak intensity region and, consequently,
multiple ionization events are also more in evidence in the spectrum shown in Fig. 4. A
noteworthy feature is the somewhat unexpected preponderence of H+ and H +
fragments,
indicating that extremely energetic proceeses occur in this intensity regime that overcomes

6

the intrinsic strength of the aromatic ring structure and causes extensive fragmentation,
opening dissociation channels that are seldom accessed in electron impact experiments. In
order to preclude the possiblity of diverting from the main focus of attention in this Letter,
we refrain from discussing the details of the ionic fragmentation patterns (such discussion
can be found in the context of ns and ps laser-induced fragmentation of C6H6 in ref. [9]).
We focus on the fact that the data presented here clearly does show a surprising degree of
similarlity in the morphology of the ion-induced and light-induced fragmentation patterns.
So, what lessons are to be drawn from our attempts to study the correspondence between
ion-induced and light-induced strong ﬁelds and their eﬀect on molecular dynamics? Clearly,
the ﬁrst lesson is that the observed similarities in the mass spectra show that this correspon-
dence is worthy of further pursuit, notwithstanding the “obvious” diﬀerences in the nature
of the ﬁelds generated by non-relativistic charged particle beams and pure electromagnetic
radiation. The second lesson originates in the practical consideration that irradiation of
matter by either type of ﬁeld entails exposure to a range of ﬁeld intensities; single-valued
ﬁelds are unlikely to be encountered, either in nature or in the laboratory. The spatial vari-
ation of ﬁeld intensity gives rise to “focal volume eﬀects” amd makes it mandatory to ensure
that equivalent intensity ranges are accessed in studies of ﬁeld-matter interactions in order
to make meaningful comparisons about the eﬀects on the overall dynamics of the time du-
ration of each type of ﬁeld. We believe that we have succeeded in achieving this equivalence
in our experiments. The somewhat surprising result to emerge is that, at least for C6H6,
whether the intense ﬁeld is of picosecond or attosecond duration is of little consequence as
far as the overall ionic fragmentation pattern is concerned. Thirdly, the other major diﬀer-
ence between the two types of ﬁelds concerns their directional properties: the laser-induced
ﬁeld has a well-deﬁned direction as it originate in light that is linearly-polarized. But, the
direction of the ion-induced ﬁeld changes in the course of the collision process. Our data
indicate that these properties seem unimportant to the overall dynamics. It may be argued
that for ion-induced ﬁelds the change of direction is too fast to be of consequence.

Can our results be interpreted within the framework of molecular quantum mechanics?
One attempt has been made to study intense laser-induced ionic fragmentation within the
framework of molecular orbital energies [10], but application of ﬁelds that last only for,
say 30 as, implies an energy uncertainty of ∼22 eV. This makes quantal treatments of the
ionization dynamics with conventional molecular states irrelevant.

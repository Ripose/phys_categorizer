We present time-resolved spectroscopic measurements of Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an
ultracold gas, revealing the pair dynamics induced by long-range van der Waals interactions between
the atoms. By detuning the excitation laser, a speciﬁc pair distribution is prepared. Penning
ionization on a microsecond timescale serves as a probe for the pair dynamics under the inﬂuence
of the attractive long-range forces. Comparison with a Monte Carlo model not only explains all
spectroscopic features but also gives quantitative information about the interaction potentials. The
results imply that the interaction-induced ionization rate can be inﬂuenced by the excitation laser.
Surprisingly, interaction-induced ionization is also observed for Rydberg states with purely repulsive
interactions.

Long-range dipolar interactions ubiquitously appear
in nature as the cause for binding forces ranging from
atomic and molecular gases [1] all the way to large biolog-
ical systems [2]. Rydberg atoms have attracted much in-
terest in this context, as they represent an ideal system to
study quantum dynamics under the inﬂuence of dipolar
interactions. As a prominent example from cavity quan-
tum electrodynamics, attractive forces between Rydberg
atoms and conducting surfaces have been observed as
level shifts in atomic beam experiments [3]. Rydberg-
Rydberg interactions leading to resonant energy trans-
fer have been studied in thermal beam experiments [4]
and later in ultracold Rydberg gases [5, 6, 7]. The long-
range dipolar interactions can be used to block multiple
Rydberg excitation [8, 9] and to create many-particle en-
tangled states, which may be employed for quantum in-
formation processing [10, 11]. So far, investigations of
Rydberg-Rydberg interactions have mainly focused on
the electronic degrees of freedom neglecting the center-of-
mass motion (“frozen Rydberg gas” [7]). In this Letter,
we present real-time measurements of the motion of in-
teracting pairs of Rydberg atoms revealing the character
and strength of the long-range interparticle interactions.

In most molecular and atomic systems the relevant
timescales of interparticle dynamics are in the sub-ns
regime calling for very fast probes. Ultracold atoms
bridge to the ns regime as the thermal energy (T <1 mK)
is negligible which allows one to study systems with much
weaker interactions or large interatomic distances. Due
to the negligible kinetic energy, the dynamics of the gas
is fully determined by the interatomic interactions. In-
teractions in a cold atomic sample have been studied
time-resolved in the case of ground state atoms using
a pump-probe scheme [12] allowing for coherent control
of the collision process [13]. Evidence for interaction-
induced motion in cold Rydberg gases was recently found
spectroscopically as the cause for Penning ionization [14].

FIG. 1: Excitation and interaction-induced ionization of a
pair of atoms on an attractive vdW potential. The atoms are
initially excited to state |ri at a distance R0 by a slightly red-
detuned laser. After excitation they are accelerated towards
each other and collide, leading to ionization of one of the
atoms. The region where this Penning ionization can occur
is indicated in gray. The number of pairs excited at speciﬁc
distances is shown in the lower graph for diﬀerent detunings.

ments, we quantitatively examine the van der Waals
(vdW) interactions between two Rydberg atoms. Our
measurements can be directly compared to calculations
of induced-dipole interaction potentials for two Rydberg
atoms, which have so far only been performed neglect-
ing spin-orbit coupling [15]. These interaction potentials
may even bear bound states resulting in the formation of
exotic ultralong-range molecules [16].

The idea of the experiment is schematically illustrated
in Fig. 1. The vdW interaction between two Rydberg
atoms leads to an energy shift of the pair excitation which
depends on the pair distance. A red-detuned laser will
therefore preferably excite atoms on an attractive poten-
tial in a certain range of distances around an already
excited atom. In this way one can use the laser detuning

to create a sample with a speciﬁc distribution of pair dis-
tances. Two examples for +6 MHz (blue) and −6 MHz
(red) detuning as derived from our model are also plot-
ted in Fig. 1. Once a pair of Rydberg atoms is excited
on an attractive potential, the atoms will be accelerated
towards each other and collide after a certain time de-
pending on their initial distance R0. These collisions can
lead to Penning ionization. By measuring the number of
ions produced after a variable time ∆t one can follow the
dynamics of the system in real time. The ionization is
thus used as a monitor signal for pair dynamics giving
quantitative information about the interaction strength.
In our setup we trap 87Rb atoms at temperatures be-
low 100 µK and a peak density on the order of 1010cm−3
in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The atoms are then
excited to Rydberg states using a two-photon excitation
scheme. The two atomic transitions 5S1/2 → 5P3/2 and
5P3/2 → nℓ are realized with two cw laser systems at
780 nm and 480 nm, respectively. The frequency of the
480-nm excitation laser is actively stabilized using an
ultra-stable reference cavity. The 480-nm laser is focused
to a waist of ∼ 37 µm at the center of the MOT with
a power of 10 mW. Two metal grids are used to apply
electric ﬁelds for stray ﬁeld compensation and for ﬁeld
ionization of the Rydberg states. Ions are detected on
a microchannel plate detector. Ref.
[17] describes the
setup in more detail.

The experimental cycle, repeated every 70 ms, is as fol-
lows: The excitation laser is switched on for 100 ns at a
given detuning. This time has been chosen suﬃciently
short so that the movement of the atoms is negligible
and no ionization takes place during the excitation. The
gas can then evolve freely for a variable time ∆t. Af-
ter that, an electric ﬁeld ramp is applied to ﬁeld ionize
the Rydberg atoms and accelerate the ions towards the
Ions produced by collisions will be drawn to
detector.
the detector at the very beginning of the ramp (i.e. at
low accelerating ﬁelds), while Rydberg states ionize at
a ﬁnite electric ﬁeld, generating a delayed detector sig-
nal. Using two boxcar integrators, the two signals are
recorded simultaneously.

Fig. 2 shows the Rydberg and ion signals at the 60D5/2
resonance as a function of the excitation laser frequency.
The frequency axis is centered at the atomic resonance.
In Fig. 2a the Rydberg signal measured directly after
excitation is displayed. The width of the excitation line
is given by the width of the intermediate 5P level (6 MHz
FWHM), the laser linewidths (2-5 MHz FWHM), the ﬁ-
nite excitation time (resulting in a 4.2 MHz FWHM of
the Fourier transform), and a ∼2 MHz broadening due
to residual electric ﬁelds. The line shape should thus be
a Voigt proﬁle, but it is still described reasonably well by
a Lorentz ﬁt (also shown in the graph) yielding a FWHM
of 12.5 MHz as expected from the above numbers. In the
graphs in Fig. 2b the development of the ion signal af-
ter diﬀerent interaction times ∆t is shown. All data are

FIG. 2: (a) 60D5/2 Rydberg excitation line (solid), with ﬁtted
Lorentzian (dotted), (b) development of the ion signal for
diﬀerent interaction times (solid) compared to Monte-Carlo
simulation (dotted). The laser frequency is given relative to
the atomic resonance.

compared to the results of the simulation (dotted lines)
described below. Within several µs the number of ions in-
creases steadily. The ion signal peaks at the red-detuned
side of the atomic resonance and exhibits a pronounced
red wing. As the interaction time increases, most ions
appear nearer to the atomic resonance, which can be ob-
served as a shift of the ionization line towards zero de-
tuning. These spectral features can easily be understood
in the picture of colliding pairs: After a short interac-
tion time only very close pairs will have had the time to
collide, and these pairs are preferably excited at large de-
tuning. For very long times, the line shape resembles the
initial Rydberg excitation line, as almost all atoms are
ionized. From these results it is obvious that by slight
detuning of the excitation laser the initial ionization rate
can be controlled. This can be of importance for appli-
cations like quantum computation with Rydberg atoms,
where the presence of ions acts as a decoherence process,
and for the investigation of ultracold plasma formation.
While a simple analytical description of pair excita-
tions as in Ref. [18] can qualitatively explain the behav-
ior, it turns out to be insuﬃcient to describe the complex
excitation process and thus does not provide quantita-
tive information about the interaction potentials. Instead

of considering only the excitation of individual pairs far
away from each other our model accounts for the interac-
tion between all atoms and allows for clustering of Ryd-
berg excitation around already excited atoms in order to
describe the system more realistically and to reproduce
the measured line shapes. We have therefore performed
a Monte Carlo simulation. 100 000 atoms are randomly
placed in a box with a Gaussian distribution along the ex-
citation laser axis to represent the MOT with a peak den-
sity of 1×1010 cm−3. Excitation of the gas is described by
an iterative procedure: In each iteration step, each of the
atoms can be excited with a certain probability. For atom
i it is given by Pi ∝ L(δ − V (Ri)) exp(−2(x2
i )/w2).
L is the line proﬁle representing the 12.5 MHz linewidth
of the Rydberg excitation as described above. L is evalu-
ated at a detuning consisting of the laser detuning δ and
the interaction energy V (Ri) with the nearest Rydberg
neighbor to atom i. The Gaussian intensity distribution
of the excitation laser with waist w = 37 µm is accounted
for by the last factor. After each Rydberg excitation, the
table of nearest Rydberg neighbors is recalculated for all
atoms. This excitation process is iterated to yield the
actual excitation fraction of a few percent at the center
of the MOT.

i + y2

The excited atoms are then combined to disjoint pairs
by successively choosing the two atoms closest to each
other. From the resulting list of distances, shown as
a histogram in the lower graph in Fig. 1, the number
of pairs colliding until a certain time ∆t can be deter-
mined. We assume an attractive potential of the form
V (R) = −C6/R6. The time it takes a pair of atoms with
initial distance R0 and an initial velocity of zero to collide
can then be approximated by the time to reach a distance
0 (2 C6/mRb)−1/2 [18]. To deter-
of zero, τcoll ≈ 0.2156 R4
mine the number of ions produced until a time ∆t, we
count the pairs that collide within this time. The whole
simulation is performed for diﬀerent laser detunings to
obtain the line shape of the ion signal.

The resulting traces shown in Fig. 2 are averaged over
ten random realizations as described above. The best
agreement of the Monte Carlo simulation with the exper-
imental results is found for C6 = 2 × 1020 au, while values
below 1020 and above 1021 are not compatible with the
measured spectra. This is in agreement with calculations
[15]. Note that in the actual experiment
following Ref.
an eﬀective potential is observed, which averages over all
possible molecular symmetries. The measured ionization
signals (Fig. 2b) are well reproduced by the simulation.
While this spectroscopic view shows how the line shape
is reproduced by the simulation, one can gain some more
insight in the system by comparing the time develop-
ment of the measured signal and the model at speciﬁc
detunings, as displayed in Fig. 3. The model predicts a
threshold for the ion production at around 3-4 µs, which
is also observed in the experiment. Furthermore, when
comparing the ionization rates at diﬀerent detunings rel-

FIG. 3: Signal growth at diﬀerent detunings: 0 MHz (solid),
+6 MHz (dotted), −6 MHz (dashed). Upper graph: measured
data (data points averaged over 3 MHz), lower graph: model.
The scale of the measurement data contains a systematic error
of a factor of two.

ative to each other, we ﬁnd very similar behavior of model
and experiment: At −6 MHz the rate is comparable to
the one at zero detuning, while at +6 MHz the rate is
signiﬁcantly lower. The error bars at the measured data
points display the standard deviation of ﬂuctuations in
the signal, while the scale is subject to a systematic error
of a factor of two.

So far we have considered the interaction potential to
be of pure vdW type. However, as pointed out in Ref.
[14], nearby dipole-coupled pair states introduce a −1/R3
behavior of the interaction potential for small distances.
To estimate the inﬂuence of this eﬀect we have used a
simple interaction Hamiltonian H considering only the
strongest couplings. From our Monte Carlo model we
infer that the distance between pairs of atoms is always
above 3 µm (see Fig. 1). These distances are above the
vdW radius (the distance at which the −1/R3 behavior
becomes apparent), i.e. the eigenenergies of H do not
diﬀer signiﬁcantly from a pure −C6/R6 potential with
C6 = 5.4 × 1020 au. Even when comparing the collision
times of pairs derived from these potentials we ﬁnd only
slight diﬀerences for typical initial distances. We thus ex-
pect a description in terms of a vdW potential to be ap-
propriate. In contrast, when re-running the Monte Carlo
calculations considering only the −1/R3 component of
the potential, the ion signal line shape could not be re-
produced at all.

This description will only be applicable as long as cold
Rydberg-Rydberg collisions are the main cause of ion-
ization. As soon as the ion density becomes suﬃciently
large to trap electrons, electron-Rydberg collisions will
determine the dynamics of the system, causing ioniza-
tion as well as ℓ and n mixing [19]. Redistribution of
atoms to other Rydberg states by Penning ionization or
by black-body radiation (estimated rates below 5600 s−1
[20]) as well as direct black-body ionization will also af-

ionized atoms after 25µs interaction time (lower graph). The

Excitation time is 300 ns, and excitation laser power 22 mW.

fect the dynamics of the system, but should not have
signiﬁcant inﬂuence during the ﬁrst few µs. For long
interaction times, however, we expect our model to be-
come increasingly inaccurate and the measured signal to
exceed the simulated one. This is indeed what we observe
for ∆t > 11 µs (see Fig. 3).

According to the above analysis one would not expect
to see ionization due to inelastic processes when the in-
teraction is repulsive. We have also performed similar
measurements for the 60S state, which exhibits repulsive
vdW interaction [15]. Surprisingly, we still observe ion-
ization, yet only on much longer timescales. Most ions
are produced on the blue-detuned side of the resonance,
which implies that the ionization rate is in conjuction
with the repulsive potential. A possible explanation is
the redistribution of states due to black-body radiation
leading to attractive dipole-dipole potentials. Atoms ini-
tially excited at small distance (i.e. at blue detuning)
could then be the ﬁrst to collide [21]. This process is
more diﬃcult to model for a cloud of atoms and a simple
approach of including black-body redistribution and sub-
sequent 1/R3 attraction in our Monte Carlo model could
not explain the observed line shapes. There may also ex-
ist attractive pair potentials of other states crossing the
repulsive vdW potentials. Atoms initially repelled from
each other may reach a crossing and return on the at-
tractive path. We will further investigate this process in
future experiments.

In conclusion, the time-resolved spectroscopic mea-
surements reveal the motion of Rydberg atoms under
the inﬂuence of van der Waals interactions as the cause of
Penning ionization. The temporal evolution of the ioniza-
tion signal allows one to distinguish van der Waals from
resonant dipole interactions. The measured strength of

4

the interaction is in good quantitative agreement with
theoretical predictions. The accuracy of determining the
interaction strength could be increased by using two ex-
citation laser pulses at diﬀerent frequencies: The ﬁrst
one to excite a dilute Rydberg gas on the atomic res-
onance, the second one detuned from resonance to cre-
ate well-deﬁned pair distributions over a larger range of
accessible detunings. F¨orster resonances may be used
to switch the character of the interaction from van der
Waals to resonant dipole interaction.
In this way our
experimental method will allow for a more precise deter-
mination of long-range potentials and challenge reﬁned
models of many-body dynamics under the inﬂuence of
dipolar forces.

We report the results of our calculations of the atomic electric dipole moments of cesium and thallium
arising from the electron-nucleus scalar-pseudoscalar interaction. The calculations are based on the
all order relativistic coupled-cluster theory. Electron correlation eﬀects, particularly in the case of
thallium are of crucial importance. We obtain a new limit for the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction
by combining the result of our thallium calculation and the measured value of the electric dipole
moment of that atom.

It is now widely recognized that atomic electric dipole
moments (EDMs) arising from the violations of parity
(P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries can provide im-
portant information about new physics beyond the Stan-
dard Model (SM) [1]. T violation implies CP violation
via the CPT theorem [2]. The dominant sources of the
EDM of a paramagnetic atom are the EDM of an elec-
tron and the scalar-pseudoscalar (S-PS) interaction be-
tween the electron and the nucleus which violates P as
well as T symmetries [3]. While the former has been dealt
with extensively [4], the latter has received relatively lit-
tle attention. Barr has shown that in two Higgs doublet
models [5], the contribution of the S-PS interaction to
an atomic EDM can exceed that due to the EDM of an
electron for certain values of the model parameters. The
S-PS electron-nucleus interaction which originates from
the S-PS electron-quark interactions could therefore shed
light on new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In this Letter we calculate the ratios of the atomic
EDMs to the S-PS coupling constants for cesium (Cs) and
thallium (Tl) using relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC)
theory. Combining the result of our Tl calculation with
experimental data we obtain a new limit for the S-PS cou-
pling constant (CS). Following the EDM measurement
of atomic Cs by Murthy et al.
[6], a series of experi-
ments were carried out by Commins and co-workers on
atomic Tl [7, 8, 9]. Currently the most accurate data on
the measurement of the EDM of any paramagnetic atom
comes from the experiment on Tl by Regan et al.
[9].

New experiments on the EDM of atomic Cs using the
techniques of laser cooling and trapping are in progress
in three diﬀerent laboratories [10, 11, 12, 13]. They could
improve the existing limit of the atomic EDM by about
two orders of magnitude.

In the above expression GF is the Fermi constant, CS is
the dimensionless S-PS constant which is given by CS =
(ZCS,p + N CS,n)/A, where Z, N and A are the atomic,
neutron and atomic mass numbers respectively. It is a
weighted average of the electron-neutron and electron-
proton coupling constants, CS,n and CS,p with CS,n ≈
CS,p. ρN (re) is the nuclear density function and γ5(=
iγ0γ1γ2γ3), which is a pseudo-scalar, is the product of
the four Dirac matrices.

EDM is responsible for mixing states of opposite pari-
ties but with the same angular momentum. The strength
of this interaction Hamiltonian is suﬃciently weak for it
to be considered as a ﬁrst-order perturbation. It is there-
fore possible to write the atomic wave function as

We have presented in table I properties related to the
EDM in the ground states of atomic Cs and Tl. The
square root of the products of the relevant hyperﬁne con-
stants (A) provide an estimate of accuracy of the EDM
matrix elements. The results of the various properties of
Cs and Tl are in most cases in very good agreement with
the measured values.

We have considered α0 as 0.00525 and β as 2.73 for all
the symmetries for both the systems. To obtain Dirac-
Fock (DF) wave function, we have undertaken 36s1/2,
34p1/2, 34p3/2, 32d3/2, 32d5/2, 30f5/2, 30f7/2, 20g7/2

36d3/2, 36d5/2, 30f5/2, 30f7/2, 25g7/2 and 25g9/2 GTOs
for thallium respectively. All core (occupied) electrons
are excited for both the systems. All orbitals are gener-
ated on a grid [18] using Fermi nuclear distribution [19].

We have calculated the ratio of DA/CS for Cs and Tl.
Important Goldstone diagrams considered in these calcu-
lations are shown in FIG. 1 and the contributions from
signiﬁcant RCC terms are given in table II. The lead-
ing contributions for both Cs and Tl come from DS(1)

(diagrams 1((c)+(d))). These diagrams represent the
DF, important pair correlation and a sub class of core-
polarization eﬀects. The DF contributions are -0.578 and

(diagrams 1((a)+(b)))
and DS(1)
(diagrams 1((e)+(f)+(g)+(h))) make very

large contributions but with opposite signs in the case of
Tl. This is primarily due to the strong Coulomb and S-PS
interactions between the 6p1/2 valence and the 6s1/2 core
electron. However, these interactions are much weaker in
the case of the 6s1/2 valence and the core electrons for
Cs. The corresponding core-polarization contribution is
therefore much smaller in size for Cs. It is of interest to
note that the contributions of two other correlation ef-
fects represented by the terms S(0)†

are non-negligible.

The results of various calculations of DA/CS are pre-
sented in table III. We have estimated the error by taking
the diﬀerence between our RCC calculations with single,
double and the leading triple excitations and just single
and double excitations. Bouchiat’s calculation is based
on an one electron potential and relativistic corrections
are added to the wave functions [26]. Venugopal’s result
for Cs is obtained using a hybrid method which combines
certain important features of many-body perturbation

theory and the multi-conﬁgurational Dirac-Fock method
[27]. M˚artensson-Pendrill and Lindroth have computed
the Dirac-Fock and various types of core-polarization
eﬀects [28]. However, they have not considered pair-
correlation eﬀects which are included to all orders of the
Coulomb interaction and one order in S-PS interaction
in our work.

measured value of DA for that atom [9]; the ﬁrst uncer-

rent limit CS = (2
to improve this limit even further if the new generation
of EDM experiments using cold cesium atoms reach their
expected levels of accuracies [10, 11, 13]. The results of
these experiments could then be combined with our cal-
culation of DA/CS for cesium (0.5% accuracy) to yield
this new limit.

In summary, we have calculated DA/CS for Cs and Tl
using RCC theory with accuracies of 0.5% and 3.3% re-
spectively. Many-body eﬀects were found to be of crucial
importance, particularly for Tl. Our calculated value of
DA/CS for Tl in combination with the experimental re-
sult of DA for the same atom gives the most accurate
limit for the S-PS coupling constant to date.

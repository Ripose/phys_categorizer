Abstract

We show that the spectrum and eigenstates of open-shell multicharged
atomic ions near the ionization threshold are chaotic, as a result of extremely
high level densities of multiply excited electron states (103 eV−1 in Au24+) and
a strong conﬁguration mixing. This complexity enables one to use statistical
methods to analyze the system. The orbital occupation numbers obey the
Fermi-Dirac distribution, and temperature can be introduced. We show that
radiative capture of electrons through the multielectron resonant states is
strongly enhanced compared to the direct radiative recombination.

In this paper we investigate the spectrum and eigenstates of a multicharged positive ion
at energies close to its ionization threshold I. Using Au24+ (I = 750 eV) as an example,
we show that this spectrum is dominated by multiple electron excitations into a few low-
1 meV
lying unoccupied orbitals. As a result, it is extremely dense, with level spacings
between the states of a given total angular momentum and parity J π. The electron Coulomb
interaction induces a strong mixing of the multiply-excited conﬁgurations, which leads to
a statistical equilibrium in the system. The latter is similar to a thermal equilibrium, and
variables such as temperature can be introduced to describe it. This enables one to use
statistical methods in the situation where a full dynamical quantum calculation is simply
impossible because of the enormous size of the Hilbert space (>
∼

We apply this approach to the problem of radiative capture of low-energy electrons
by multicharged positive ions, and show that the contribution of resonant multielectronic
recombination, which proceeds via electron capture into the multiply-excited compound
states, is much greater than that of the direct radiative recombination. Our calculation gives
a quantitative explanation of huge enhancements of the recombination rates, and removes
the “enormous discrepancies between theoretical and experimental rate coeﬃcients” [1]. The
situation here turns out to be similar to the radiative neutron capture by complex nuclei
[(n, γ) reaction] where the resonance mechanism involving the compound nucleus states is
also much stronger than the direct capture [2].

So far the enhanced recombination at low electron energies <
∼

1 eV has been observed
for a number of ions [3]. Its magnitude ranges from a factor of about ten for Ar13+, Au50+,
Pb53+, and U28+ [4], to over a hundred for Au25+ [1]. This enhancement is sensitive to the
electronic structure of the target, e.g., the recombination rates of Au49+ and Au51+ are much
smaller than that of Au50+ [4]. For few-electron ions, e.g., C4+, Ne7+ and Ar15+ [5–7], the
observed rates are described well by the sum of the direct and dielectronic recombination
rates. In more complicated cases, like U28+ or Au25+, the questions of what are the particular
resonances just above the threshold and how they contribute to the recombination “remain
a mystery” [8].

Let us consider the problem of electron recombination on Au25+. Due to electron cor-
relations the electron can be captured into an excited state of the compound Au24+ ion.
Au24+ has 55 electrons. Its ground state belongs to the 1s2 . . . 4f 9 conﬁguration. Figure 1
shows the energies of its relativistic orbitals nlj from a self-consistent Dirac-Fock calcula-
tion. The energy of the highest orbital occupied in the ground state is ε4f7/2 =
29.7 a.u.
Our relativistic conﬁguration-interaction (CI) calculation of the ground states of Au24+4f 9
and Au24+4f 8 shows that they are characterized by J = 15
2 and 6, and their total energies
18764.80 a.u., respectively. Thus, the ionization threshold of Au24+ is
18792.36 and
are
I = 27.56 a.u.= 750 eV.

The excited states of the ion are generated by transferring electrons from the ground state
into the unoccupied orbitals above the Fermi level, or into the partially ﬁlled 4f orbital. We
are interested in the excitation spectrum of Au24+ near its ionization threshold. This energy
(27.5 a.u.) is suﬃcient to push up a few of the 4f electrons, and even excite one or two
electrons from the 4d orbital [9]. Thus, we consider Au24+ as a system of n = 19 electrons
above the inactive Kr-like 1s2 . . . 4p6 core.

The number of multielectron states obtained by distributing 19 electrons over 31 rela-
tivistic orbitals, 4d3/2 through to 7g9/2, is enormous, even if we are only interested in the

2

excitation energies below 27.5 a.u. It is impossible to perform any CI calculation for them.
However, there is another simpler way to analyze the spectrum. The scale of the conﬁgu-
ration interaction strength is determined by the two-body Coulomb matrix elements. Their
typical size in Au24+ is about 1 a.u., i.e., much smaller than I. Conﬁguration mixing aside,
the CI does not shift the mean energies of the conﬁgurations. Therefore, we can construct
the excitation spectrum of Au24+ by calculating the mean energies Ei of the conﬁgurations,

1. For most abundant J π states ρJ π (E) is given by Eq. (3) with AJ π

At ﬁrst sight the huge level density makes the Au24+ problem very complicated.
In
reality this complexity enables one to use statistical methods to describe the system. The
interaction between multiply-excited conﬁguration states mixes them completely, and they
loose their individual features.
In this regime the spectral statistics are close to those
of a random matrix ensemble, the eigenstates cannot be characterized by any quantum
numbers except the exact ones (energy and J π), and the orbital occupation numbers deviate
prominently from integers. This regime can be described as many-body quantum chaos. We
have extensively studied it in direct numerical calculations for the rare-earth atom of Ce –
a system with four valence electrons [11–13].

A Breit-Wigner ﬁt of the mean-squared components yields N = 975 and Γspr = 0.50 a.u.

The spreading of the basis states due to conﬁguration interaction introduces a natural
statistical averaging in the system. Based on this averaging, a statistical theory of ﬁnite
Fermi systems of interacting particles can be developed [14].
It enables one to calculate
various properties of the system without diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, as sums over the
basis states, e.g., the mean occupations numbers, na(E) =
is the
occupation number of the orbital a in the basis state k. Using a simple Gaussian model
spreading we calculate mean orbital occupation numbers at diﬀerent excitation energies.

In summary, the resonant radiative capture mechanism fully explains the strongly en-
hanced recombination rates observed for eV electrons on multicharged ions. Its origin is in
the high level densities of chaotic multiply-excited electron states in multicharged ions. The
size of the enhancement is sensitive to the electron structure of the ion, which determines
the level density. We have shown that a statistical approach can be applied to the analysis
of this complex system. One can also use a statistical theory to calculate mean-squared ma-
trix elements between multiply excited chaotic states in terms of single-particle amplitudes,
occupation numbers, Γspr and D [11,12,17], and obtain accurate quantitative information
about the processes involving chaotic states and resonances. At higher electron energies the
resonant capture proceeds via so-called doorway states [10] – simple dielectronic autoionizing
states, which are then “fragmented” into the dense spectrum of multiply-excited resonances
(see [8] and [12] and Refs. therein).

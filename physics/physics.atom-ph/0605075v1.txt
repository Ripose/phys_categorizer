State-dependent quantum electrodynamic corrections are evaluated for the hyperﬁne splitting of nS states
for arbitrary principal quantum number n. The calculations comprise both the self-energy and the vacuum-
polarization correction of order α (Z α)2 EF and the recoil correction of order (Z α)2 (m/M ) EF . Higher-
order corrections are summarized and partly reevaluated as well. Accurate predictions for hydrogen hyperﬁne
splitting intervals of nS states with n = 2, . . . , 8 are presented. The results obtained are important due to steady
progress in hydrogen spectroscopy for transitions involving highly excited S states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Investigations of the hyperﬁne structure in light hydrogen-
like atomic systems are interesting for two main reasons.
First, accurate measurements of the hyperﬁne splitting (hfs),
combined with high-precision ab initio calculations, can yield
fundamental tests of bound-state QED theory. Second, the
accurate knowledge of the hfs also constitutes a necessary in-
gredient in the determination of fundamental constants from
hydrogen and deuterium spectroscopy. The hyperﬁne com-
ponents of transitions in hydrogen can be accurately resolved
at the current level of spectroscopic accuracy, and the knowl-
edge of the hfs of excited states is therefore necessary for the
interpretation of the experimental data.

The ground-state hfs in hydrogen is known with an out-
standing accuracy (a part in 1012) for over of 3 decades, and
the value of

∆E1S = 1 420 405 751.768(1) Hz

(1)

has been obtained in Ref. [1] as a conservative average of var-
ious experimental investigations of comparable accuracy, the
ﬁrst of which was reported in Ref. [2]. Unfortunately, our the-
oretical understanding of the ground-state hfs is limited by the
insufﬁcient knowledge of the nuclear charge and magnetiza-
tion distributions, whose contribution of about
50 kHz (30
ppm) cannot be accurately calculated at present.

−

One of the possibilities to overcome this difﬁculty [3] is to
study the normalized difference of the nS and 1S hfs inter-
vals,

∆n = n3 ∆EnS −

∆E1S .

(2)

In this combination of energy intervals, the hfs energy shifts
due to the nuclear charge and magnetization distributions are
largely eliminated. Indeed, the lowest-order nuclear correc-
tions to ∆E1S and ∆EnS scale with the nonrelativistic elec-
2 which
tron density at the position of the nucleus
φn(r = 0)
|
|
is strictly proportional to n−3. The nuclear effects thus do
not contribute to the difference ∆n to leading order. Theoret-

ical investigations show that the speciﬁc difference ∆n pro-
vides an opportunity to test the QED theory of bound states
on a level of about two orders of magnitude better than for the
ground-state hyperﬁne interval ∆E1S alone [1]. According to
widely accepted terminology, the corrections that depend on
2 only are called “state independent”.
n through
φn(r = 0)
|
|
Thus, only state dependent correction should be considered in
theoretical investigations of the difference ∆n.

Accurate experimental results for the difference ∆2 are
presently available for the hydrogen, deuterium, and the 3He
ion. Notably, recent progress has been achieved for hydrogen
[4] and deuterium [5] via optical spectroscopy, by comparing
the 1S and 2S hyperﬁne splittings via a phase-coherent opti-
cal measurements of the 1S(F = 0)
2S (F = 0) vs. the
2S (F = 1) transition. The best absolute ac-
1S(F = 1)
curacy for the difference ∆2 is, however, still obtained for
the 3He ion in a combination of two relatively old measure-
ments [6, 7],

⇔

⇔

∆2(3He+) = 1 189.979 (71) kHz .

(3)

While the speciﬁc difference of the 2S and 1S hfs inter-
vals has been a subject of experimental and theoretical [3, 8]
investigations for a long time, the difference ∆n for n > 2
has attracted much less attention up to now. The case n > 2
is, however, becoming of signiﬁcant interest nowadays, due
to steady progress in hydrogen spectroscopy for transitions
involving highly excited S states. Two ongoing experiments
could be mentioned in this connection, which concern the hy-
drogen 1S
3S transition [9, 10] and are expected to reach a
sub-kHz level of accuracy.

−

In the present work, we perform a calculation of the lead-
ing state-dependent self-energy and vacuum-polarization cor-
rections for an arbitrary nS state. For the case n = 2, we
reproduce the well-known results by Zwanziger [8]. We also
generalize the derivation of the leading state-dependent recoil
correction given by Sternheim [3] for n = 2 to general n.
Next, we summarize and partly reevaluate the state-dependent
higher-order correction and present numerical results for the
difference ∆n with n = 2, . . . , 8 for hydrogen.

This paper is organized as follows: Basic quantities are
introduced in Sec. II. Third-order state-dependent correc-
tions are analyzed and summarized in Sec. III. Among these,
self-energy corrections are treated in Sec. III A, vacuum-
polarization corrections in Sec. III B, and recoil corrections in
Sec. III C. The current status of higher-order state-dependent
corrections is discussed in Sec. IV. Finally, the total theoret-
ical predictions for the normalized difference of the hfs inter-
vals ∆n in hydrogen are presented in Sec. V for n = 2, . . . , 8.

Here, δ∆SE
n is the contribution to the normalized difference
∆n due to self-energy effects, where ∆n is deﬁned according
to Eq. (2). In general, we will denote various contributions
to ∆n by the symbol δ∆n with appropriate superscripts. The
coefﬁcients aSE
ij (n, 1) are understood as originating from the
difference aSE
ij (1S), with aSE
aSE
ij (n, 1) = aSE
ij (nS)
ij (nS)
being the corresponding coefﬁcient for the nS state. As usual,
the ﬁrst index of aSE
ij counts the power of Zα, and the second
one indicates the power of the logarithm ln[(Zα)−2].

The self-energy correction (13) consists of two parts in-
duced by the low-energy and the high-energy virtual pho-
tons [11]. The low-energy part can be immediately obtained
by generalizing formulas given in Refs. [11, 12, 13]. The

We now turn to the contribution due to high-energy vir-
tual photons. Up to relative order α(Z α)2, we can use the

φ, Eq. (17) simply gives the leading term α/(2π). The
ψ
numerator of Eq. (17) diverges in relative order (Z α)2 when
evaluated on an nS state. A ﬁnite result is obtained, however,
when the weighted (or normalized) difference of matrix ele-

This result can be immediately obtained according to the im-

scribed in Ref. [13], which contains a correction to the Bethe
logarithm induced by a Dirac-delta local potential (see also
the entries in the forth column of Table II of Ref. [17]).

one given by a matrix element of the radiatively corrected ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld and the other by a matrix element of
the vacuum-polarization operator between the wave functions
corrected by the presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld.

We start with the ﬁrst part. To the leading order, the radia-
tively corrected magnetic interaction (magnetic loop) is well-
known to be

D. Summary of the theory up to third order

To the leading order in the parameters α, Z α, and m/M ,
the normalized difference of the hyperﬁne-structure nS inter-
vals ∆n is given by the sum of the relativistic (Breit), self-
energy, vacuum-polarization, and recoil corrections:

with the nuclear magnetic moment µ = g µN I. Notice that
this expression follows from Eq. (12) after restoring the cor-
rect reduced-mass dependence.

For the particular (and the most important) case n = 2,
the coefﬁcients in Eq. (48) were obtained long ago [3, 8, 19].
The full n dependence of the coefﬁcients aSE
20 was
reported in Ref. [16]. In the present investigation, we have
derived the results for all coefﬁcients in Eq. (48) for general
n. The self-energy, vacuum-polarization, and recoil correc-
tion are given by Eqs. (27), (41), and (47), respectively. The
remaining second-order Breit contribution to ∆n is given by

21 and aVP

According to Ref. [16], analogous considerations are valid

also for the radiative-recoil correction, and hence

We now turn our attention to the state-dependent recoil cor-
rection to order (m/M ) (Z α)3 EF , which we evaluate in the
logarithmic approximation. We have identiﬁed two such con-
tributions. The ﬁrst one can be obtained as a second-order
perturbation correction induced by two effective local poten-
tials, the ﬁrst one being HS [Eq.(10b)] and the second one
corresponding to the logarithmic recoil correction to the Lamb
shift to order (Z α)5 m2/M . The result is

Higher-order QED and nuclear corrections to the difference
∆2 were extensively investigated during the last years [16,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. The general n dependence of the
difference ∆n received signiﬁcantly less attention up to now.
In this section, we would like to summarize the results for
higher-order corrections and reevaluate some of them.

The higher-order relativistic (Breit) corrections are imme-

diately obtained by expanding the general formula (8):

where the sixth-order contribution is included for complete-
ness.

The state-dependent two-loop correction to order α2 (Z α)2
was found in Ref. [16] in the logarithmic approximation. This
result can be easily derived if we observe that the leading one-
loop a10 correction for the ground-state hfs is generated by
an effective magnetic form-factor correction [Eq. (23a)] to the
Hamiltonian (10b). We thus employ (10b) as an input for a
Dirac-delta correction to the Bethe logarithm and obtain the
result

This expression generalizes the result for the difference ∆2
reported in Ref. [23]. The second contribution (absent in
Ref. [23]) is obtained as a second-order perturbation induced
by the operator HS and by the operator responsible for the
nonlogarithmic recoil correction to the Lamb shift to order
(Z α)5 m2/M . The logarithm of Z α then arises from the
second term of the Z α expansion of the electron propagator
after an integration over the logarithmic region [26]. The re-
sult reads

We note that this contribution, unlike Eq. (54), is ﬁnite for
single nS states. For 1S state, the constant in Eq. (55) turns
into (124/9 + 28/3 ln 2), which coincides with a part of the
complete 1S result obtained by Kinoshita [27] (2 CS in his
notation). Our result for the logarithmic part of the fourth-
order recoil correction is the sum of Eqs. (54) and (55),

We do not have a proof that this result is complete.

Some incomplete results for the fourth-order one-loop self-
energy and vacuum-polarization corrections were obtained in
Ref. [16]. With misprints being corrected in [22], these cor-

rections read, respectively,

It should be noted that the one-loop self-energy correction
yields the largest contribution among all fourth-order correc-
tions mentioned so far and the incompleteness of the result
(57a) provides the dominant theoretical uncertainty for ∆n.
For the particular case n = 2, this correction was evalu-
ated numerically to all orders in Z α in Refs. [21, 25]. The
deviation of the contribution (57a) from the all-order result
was found to be on the level of 20%. The evaluation of the
complete result for the fourth-order vacuum-polarization cor-
rection is a much simpler task than for the self-energy.
It
can be solved either analytically, as was done for n = 2 in
Ref. [22, 28], or (which is much easier) numerically, as was
done for n = 2 in Ref. [25]. However, in view of the absence
of complete results for the self-energy correction, we do not
pursue the matter any further in the current investigation.

V. THEORETICAL RESULTS FOR ∆n

In this section, we collect all theoretical contributions avail-
able to the normalized difference of nS states ∆n [Eq. (2)].
Numerical results for individual contributions and the total
theoretical values of ∆n in hydrogen are listed in Table III
for principal quantum numbers n = 1, . . . , 8. The second-
and third-order corrections summarized by Eq. (48) are given
in the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of this Table. Forth-order QED correc-
tions discussed in Sec. IV are tabulated in the next seven rows,
and the nuclear-structure correction completes the analysis.
Parameters of the proton used for calculating numerical data
in Table III agree with those from Table 8 of Ref. [1]. The

and δ∆HVP

nuclear-structure correction for the ground-state hfs that en-
ters Eq. (58) was taken from Ref. [22], where it was obtained
by subtracting all known QED corrections from the experi-
mental result for the ground-state hfs (1). Its numerical value
is

−
We already mentioned above that in the particular case
n = 2, there are complete all-order results available for the
δ∆HSE
corrections. We thus employ the numer-
n
ical values for the self-energy and vacuum-polarization re-
mainder functions for the difference ∆2 as given in Ref. [25],
as well as the uncertainty estimates given in the cited refer-
ence. The corresponding entries in the table are marked with
the asterisk. For n > 2, we use the formulas (57a) and (57b)
and ascribe the 50% uncertainty to them. The error estimates
for the other forth-order corrections are as follows: for the
two-loop and the radiative recoil corrections, we assume the
uncertainty to be a half the numerical value of the logarith-
mic terms, while for the recoil correction we use 100% of the
correction given by Eq. (56).

The two last rows of Table III are reserved for the total the-
oretical predictions for the normalized difference ∆n and for
the complete values of the hfs frequency of excited hydrogenic
nS states. The latter are obtained by combining the highly ac-
curate experimental value of the ground-state hfs interval (1)
and the theoretical prediction for ∆n given in the previous row
of the table.

For the case n = 2, our evaluation differs from the previ-
ous investigation of the difference ∆2 presented in Ref. [22]
in two ways: (i) we employ the latest numerical results for
the self-energy remainder from Ref. [25] and the error esti-
mate from this reference and (ii) we also have found an ad-
ditional (numerically small) higher-order logarithmic recoil
contribution (55). Despite the small change of the theoret-
ical prediction, our ﬁnal result for the hfs frequency of the
2S state still deviates by 1.4 σ from the experimental result
E2S = 177 566 860(16) Hz [4]. We mention also a similar
(1.8 σ) deviation of the theoretical value of ∆2 for the 3He
ion from the experimental result (3) observed in Ref. [25].

VI. CONCLUSION

The normalized difference of the hfs intervals ∆2 =
∆E1S has been a subject for both theoretical and
8 ∆E2S −
experimental investigations since a long time. In this paper,
we have presented calculations that generalize the previous
studies of ∆n = n3 ∆EnS −
∆E1S to general n. Our re-
sults are complete through third order in the parameters α,
Z α, and m/M ; an estimation of the fourth-order corrections
is also supplied.

The dominant source of the present theoretical uncertainty
for the difference ∆n comes from the higher-order one-loop
self-energy correction. Further improvement of the theory can
be achieved by a numerical all-order (in Z α) evaluation of
this correction. Such a calculation has been carried out for the
difference ∆2 in Refs. [21, 25] based on a method developed
by a number of authors [29, 30, 31] and seems feasible for
higher values of n as well. It should be noted that the results

for hydrogen reported in Refs. [21, 25] involved an extrapola-
tion of numerical data obtained for Z
5 towards Z = 1. It
would clearly be preferable to perform a direct numerical cal-
culation of the higher-order self-energy correction for Z = 1,
as it was done for the Lamb shift in Refs. [32, 33]. This project
is underway.

[15] For the ﬁrst time, the coefﬁcient aSE

20 (2, 1) was evaluated by
Zwanziger [8] to be aSE
20 (2, 1) = −5.37(6). A more accurate
value for this coefﬁcient was later obtained by P. J. Mohr by
recalculating the integrals listed in Eq. (B.5) of Ref. [8] (pri-
vate communication). According to P. J. Mohr, the expression
(1 − s)2 in Eq. (B.5) of the cited reference should be replaced
by (1 − s). After the elimination of this typographical error,
the formulas of Ref. [8] may be used for an accurate evaluation
of the difference aSE
20 (2, 1). The private communication by P. J.
Mohr is also quoted as reference number [18] of Ref. [7], and
the value of −5.5515 given in Eq. (37) of Ref. [7] is the sum of
20 (2, 1) + aVP
aSE
20 (2, 1), which implies a value of −5.2212 for
aSE
20 (2, 1). According to S. G. Karshenboim (private commu-
nication), the value of −5.221 233(3) for aSE
20 (2, 1) has been
obtained independently by J. R. Sapirstein and S. G. Karshen-
boim in an unpublished investigation, as cited in Ref. [16].

The eﬃcient photoionization of a Bose-Einstein condensate requires the creation of ions with the
smallest possible transfer of atoms from the condensate into the thermal phase. The spontaneous
decay from excited states into atomic states with momentum diﬀerent from the initial one should
be reduced. We investigate theoretically the two-photon ionization of a rubidium condensate using
near resonant excitation to the 6P state and second photon at 421 nm or 1002 nm into the contin-
uum. Diﬀerent ionization schemes with coherent control of the ﬁrst excitation and reduction of the
spontaneous decay are presented.

INTRODUCTION

The realization of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of alkali atom vapors has attracted much interest into new
aspects of photon-matter interaction arising from the quantum nature of the atomic sample. Recently attention has
been paid to the photoionization of a BEC by monochromatic laser light [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The products of the pho-
toionization process (electrons and ions) obey to Fermi-Dirac statistics. Due to the quantum nature of the initial
atomic target and the narrow spectral width of the laser ionization source, the occupation number of the electron/ion
ﬁnal states may become close to unity, especially for a laser excitation close to threshold. If this regime is reached
the ionization rate could be slowed down by the Pauli blockade, with the occupation of ionized states determined by
the balance between the laser ionization of the condensate and the rate of escape of the ionization products from the
condensed system. Moreover, the electrostatic interaction between the ions and neutral atoms in the condensate is
expected to originate localized deformations in the condensate density distribution. Either an increase or a decrease
in the neutral atom spatial density, depending on the sign of the atom-ion phase shift, could be originated in small
regions surrounding the ions [6].

The experimental study of these processes requires the production of a large ionic concentration within a conden-
sate on time shorter than the timescale on which the ions escape from the system, of the order of hundred ns for
typical condensate samples, without simultaneously destroying the condensate. Instead, in the two-photon ionization
experiments reported in refs. [2, 3, 4, 5] the photoionization laser produced a signiﬁcant transfer of atoms from the
condensate into the thermal cloud. Those experimental investigations demonstrated that the rubidium two-photon
ionization was not performed in eﬃcient way, i.e. without producing a large depletion of the condensate atoms with
their transformation into thermal atoms. Indeed, in typical two-photon ionization experiments the ionization is in-
creased only at the expenses of a large production of thermal atoms.

The present work reports a theoretical investigation of the eﬃciency realized in the ionization of atomic rubidium.
This work addresses a target which is diﬀerent from those associated with the typical investigations of multiphoton
processes. Our aim is not to increase the multiphoton ionization probability per se. In contrast, the production of
ions is compared to optical pumping rate, produced by the spontaneous emission, transferring condensate atoms into
the thermal cloud. The ionization eﬃciency will be determined by the decrease in the loss towards atomic states
initially not occupied, i.e. a decrease of optical pumping into sink thermal states, and by the increase in the number
of ions.

Our condensate ionization scheme takes place in a three-level cascade scheme, the ﬁnal one being the atomic contin-
uum. The condensate losses are produced by spontaneous emission from the intermediate excited state. An eﬃcient
ionization is realized for an atomic transfer into the continuum with a reduced real excitation of the intermediate
level, whence a reduced role of spontaneous emission processes from that intermediate level. The task of reducing the
transfer towards sink levels is usually reached applying the STIRAP technique for the coherent transfer between the
initial and ﬁnal levels of a three level scheme, as analyzed in [7, 8], and for transfers to and from a continuum as in
[9, 10, 11]. An eﬃcient STIRAP transfer, which relies on the coherent coupling of the initial and the ﬁnal state, can
be realized only using very short laser pulses, i. e. shorter than the characteristic decoherence time of the system.

In the case of photoionization, the use of laser pulses shorter than the typical electron-ion decoherence times would
prevent from creating the narrow kinetic energy distribution for the electrons and ions required for the Pauli blockade.
Instead we will analyze here the two-photon ionization produced by narrow band cw radiation.

For long interaction times the photoionization and optical pumping processes can be described through a simple
rate equation approach. At shorter interaction times, comparable to or smaller than the spontaneous emission life-
time from the ﬁrst excited state, the determination of the photoionization eﬃciency requires the solution of density
matrix equations. Our solution of the density matrix equations searching for a regime of eﬃcient ionization has strong
connections with the investigations of refs. [12, 13] for the lineshapes of atomic excitation and ionization in a cascade
three-level system under two-color excitation as a function of the time delay in the application of the two lasers.

Section II describes the characteristics of our three-level scheme. Section III analyzes the case of simultaneous
application of the excitation and photoionization lasers for long interaction times on the basis of the rate equation
solution. In Section IV we analyze the ionization eﬃciency for diﬀerent temporal shapes of the excitation and ioniza-
tion laser pulses using the density matrix approach. The lengths of the laser pulses and their time delay represent the
experimental parameters controlling the ionization eﬃciency. Section V analyzes ionization based on a rapid adiabatic
transfer.

intermediate |ei state. The thermal sink state |si is occupied by the spontaneous emission decay from the |ei state.

II. ATOMIC LEVEL AND HAMILTONIAN

We investigate the rubidium two-photon ionization scheme from the 5S1/2 ground state to the continuum with
intermediate resonant state the 6P3/2 state at 2.94 eV above the 5S1/2 ground state as in the experiment of ref. [4].
The two-photon ionization was produced either by two photons a 421 nm or by a two color process, one photon at 421
nm and a second one at 1002 nm. The photoionization cross sections for absorption of one 421 nm or one 1002 nm
photon from the 6P state have a small diﬀerence, not playing an important role for the present investigation of the
photoionization eﬃciency. Instead a larger intensity was available at the 1002 nm wavelength, and the contribution
to ionization of the two color process was much larger than the contribution of the one-color photoionization by two
421 nm photons.

The level scheme of Fig. 1 schematizes the two-photon ionization process from the ground state |gi of the condensate
to the condensate ionic state |ii with a near resonant excitation of the intermediate level |ei. The population of the
intermediate state |ei may decay back into the ground state through emission of spontaneous emission photons. For
a sample composed by a Bose-Einstein condensate with atoms having a momentum p = 0, the spontaneous emission
produces ground state atoms with an atomic momentum p diﬀerent from zero. These atoms in the p 6= 0 ground
state constitute a thermal component separate from the condensate, to be described through a sink state |si whose
atomic properties are equivalent to those of the |gi state. The |si state is ﬁlled by the spontaneous emission with rate
Γ from the |ei state. The interaction of the |si state with the photoionization radiation is the same one of the |gi
state. However the photoionization from the |si state produces ions having an initial momentum p 6= 0 and weakly
interacting with the condensate. Therefore that photoionization process is not relevant for our target of electrons/ions
with a small kinetic energy[3] and it will not be considered into our analysis.

A laser with angular frequency ω1, Rabi frequency Ω1 and detuning δ = ω1 − ωeg acts on the |gi → |ei transition,
while a laser with angular frequency ω2 and intensity I2 acts on the |ei → |ii transition. The intensity of the ﬁrst

laser is I1 = ¯hωeg
1. The ionization from the excited state |ei is described by the σi ionization cross section for the
laser with intensity Ii. For rubidium the atomic parameters are Γ = 8.9 × 106 s−1, σ1 = 4.7 × 10−24 m−2 for the 421
nm radiation and σ2 = 16.4 × 10−24 m−2 for the 1002 nm radiation[5].

The evolution of the atomic system interacting with the laser radiation is given by the Optical Bloch Equations for

the atomic density matrix[14, 15, 16] on the Hilbert space spanned by the four atomic states introduced above

with the additional condition ρgg + ρee + ρii + ρss = 1, where ˜ρeg denotes the interaction representation of ρeg. We
have not included into the density matrix equations the excitation and ionization of the sink state |si by the two
lasers, because those processes do not modify the number of atoms lost or ionized from the condensate phase. The
numerical results reported in the following are valid not only for the simple three-level scheme of Fig. 1, but also for
the real rubidium level scheme, with the excited state occupation spontaneously decaying to other intermediate states
before reaching the ﬁnal sink state[5]. Both the ions and the losses into the sink states deriving from the condensate
component are equivalent in the two cases.

The eﬃciency of the ionization will be measured through the ratio r between the atomic population in the sink

state and the atomic population in the ionic state, after the end of the laser interaction

where the time
τ is longer than the laser pulse length τ in order to include also the spontaneous emission losses

corresponds to a low (high) ionization eﬃciency.

For any temporal shape of the applied laser pulses, a key parameter for the photoionization eﬃciency is the laser
detuning δ from the |gi → |ei transition. For decreasing detunings the two-photoionization process becomes more
eﬃcient owing to the large excitation of the intermediate |ei state; at the same time, however, also the spontaneous
emission becomes more eﬃcient. As a consequence, for decreasing detunings the loss rate towards the |si state
usually increases faster than the ionization rate, resulting in the decrease of eﬃciency for the condensate atoms
photoionization.

III. LONG LASER PULSES

During the simultaneous application of the two lasers, the atomic population decays from the excited state |ei and
is lost from the system with total rate equal to ΓL = Γ+ σ1I1 + σ2I2. Therefore, at every time t the total population in
the |gi and in the |ei states decays with a time dependent loss rate equal to ΓLρee(t). In the case in which Γ, σiIi ≪ Ω1
the ionized fraction of population and the fraction lost by spontaneous emission can be estimated by treating the
losses as a perturbation of the steady state solution for the Eqs.(1-5) restricted to the [|gi, |ei] two-level system. This
perturbative solution is

IV. PULSED EXCITATION

As demonstrated in refs [12, 13], under the interaction with coherent pulsed radiation the atomic excitation presents
diﬀerent properties than in measurements performed under the cw excitation regime. In the regime of pulsed exci-
tation, the time evolution of populations and coherences becomes very important. For calculating the ionization
eﬃciency it is necessary to perform the numerical solution of the density matrix equations (1-5). In fact, it should
be taken into account that the actual occupation ρee of the excited state is characterized by Rabi oscillations with
eﬀective Rabi frequency Ωeﬀ
1 + δ2. Because the ionization depends on the occupation of that state, the atomic
ionized fraction increases in time with oscillations at the same frequency.

1 =

Ω2

p

Fig. 2 compares the exact solution of the density matrix equations and the perturbation solution given by Eqs.(8).
The average ionized and the lost fraction are well described by the perturbative solution. However, due to the oscilla-
tory evolution of the excited state population, the numerical solution of Eqs. (1-5) is required in order to obtain the
correct value of the ionization eﬃciency parameter r.

Whenever τ ≤ τL, while no more ionization occurs after the duration τ of the pulse and the total ionized fraction
remains equal to ρii(τ ), a ﬁnite fraction of population ρee(τ ) remains in the excited state at the end of the atom-laser
interaction and decays by spontaneous emission into the sink state. Therefore for a pulse of duration τ the ionization
eﬃciency ratio of Eq. 6 is given by

In general r > f and the maximum eﬃciency of the ionization process corresponds to the minimum value r∞ = f .

The oscillating behavior of the ionization process appears also measuring the ionization as function of the detuning
δ. Such a behavior is shown by the results of Fig. 3 where the ionized fraction ρii and the eﬃciency ratio r are plotted
as a function of the laser detuning δ from the |ei excited state, at ﬁxed interaction time τ . Owing to the choice
τ = 2π/Ω1, ρee(τ ) = 0, so that r has a minimum (and the eﬃciency has a maximum) at zero detuning. At larger
values of the detunings ρii decreases with oscillations, and ρee(τ ) assumes values dependent on the eﬀective frequency
of the Rabi oscillations. The role of the Rabi oscillations is more clear on the plot of Fig. 3(b) for the eﬃciency ratio
r.

For ﬁxed pulse duration the oscillating time dependence of the excited state population with detuning-dependent
eﬀective Rabi frequency Ωeﬀ
1 produces an oscillating dependence of the ionized and of the lost fractions, and thus also
of the ionization eﬃciency, as a function of the detuning δ/2π. In particular, the large oscillation of the ionization
eﬃciency is determined by the oscillating amount of population remaining in the excited state |ei at the end of the
laser pulse and decaying totally by spontaneous emission into the sink state |si. As a consequece, r assumes oscillating
values which are always larger than the f value of Eq. (11), and can be equal to that value only for isolated detunings
where the eﬀective Rabi frequency Ωeﬀ

1 produces a 2π pulse for the applied duration of the atom-laser interaction.

The occupation of the excited state at the end of the laser pulse can be annulled in the regime deﬁned as coherent
population return[12, 13]. For the coherent excitation of two-level atomic systems subjected to light pulses of duration
τ and detuning δ from resonance, the dynamics of the atomic population is adiabatic if the detuning is signiﬁcantly
larger than the Fourier width of the pulse, i.e., if δ ≫ 1/τ . In this case the dressed state occupied at the end of the
excitation is the same one as before the excitation. For a smooth pulse at constant detuning, that state coincides
with the atomic ground state, so that even if the excited state is populated during the application of the pulse, all
the population is adiabatically brought back to the ground state at the end of the process. Therefore no population
fraction remains in the excited state, ρee(τ ) = 0. This regime of coherent population return does not produces any loss
into the sink state at the laser pulse end. Results showing the advantages of this regime in the two-photon ionization
are reported in Fig. 4.

We considered several durations of pulses all of them with the shape shown in Fig. 4(a). For each duration of the IR
square pulse, the blue intensity had a Gaussian proﬁle such that the intensity decreased to 1/e3 of the peak value in
correspondence of the IR pulse start and end. In Fig. 4 (b) and (c) the ionized fraction ρii and the parameter r of the
the ratio between the atomic fraction in the sink state and the ionized fraction are shown, respectively, as a function
of the laser detuning δ, for several durations of the laser pulse and at a given blue Rabi frequency. In all cases, the
eﬀects of adiabatic excitation are visible, because for each pulse duration there is a minimum detuning necessary to
obtain the optimal ratio r. The value of the minimum detuning is only slightly sensitive to the Rabi frequency of the
transition, because, as pointed out in [12], no power broadening occurs in a scheme of coherent population return. The
limiting value of r reached at large detunings corresponds to the minimum value f calculated at the laser intensities

V. RAPID ADIABATIC PASSAGE

Another excitation scheme allowing an eﬃcient and robust transfer of the population from the ground to the excited
state is the rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) technique[17, 18]. This technique takes advantage of the population
adiabatic evolution in order to transfer almost the whole population from the ground state to the excited state,
blocking completely the population return. RAP is produced by a time dependence of the laser detuning, and for an
eﬃcient transfer the laser detuning changes from a very large and negative value to a very large and positive value,
or vice versa, during the application of the light. The laser frequency experiences a chirp, and the chirp duration
should be shorter than the excited state lifetime. Under these circumstances, the lowest energy adiabatic state of the
system coincides with the ground state before the application of the light and with the excited state at the end of the
process. When this scheme is applied to the lower atomic transition of the rubidium two-photon ionization, it allows
to transfer the ground state population to the |6P i state, from where a pulse of IR light, with the time sequence shown
in Fig. 5(left-hand side), produces the ionization shown in Fig. 5(right-hand side). Because the IR pulse ionizes the
excited state atoms and also modiﬁes the energy of the excited state, for any temporal shape of the two laser pulses
the largest two-photon ionization is obtained for a particular delay of the IR pulse with respect to the blue laser pulse.
For the pulse shapes of Fig. 5 the maximum ionization was obtained when the center of the IR pulse was delayed by
0.02 µs with respect to the center of the blue pulse. A linear chirp of the blue detuning was examined, but the chirp
exact shape had a minor inﬂuence on the ionization eﬃciency, provided that the detuning diﬀerence between initial
and ﬁnal value was larger than ∼100 MHz. Suppressing the oscillatory behavior of the excited population, the RAP
led to an excited state occupation and an ionized fraction larger than those obtained by pulses of the same shape
but at constant blue detuning. For the blue laser scanning of Fig. 5 the ionization fraction was larger by a factor 2
than produced at constant blue detuning (0.0057 against 0.0027). The RAP technique is thus suitable for producing
the maximum possible fraction of ionized population within a laser pulse sequence of short duration, during which
the ratio between the atomic population in the sink state and the atomic population in the ionic state corresponds to

the optimal value f . Due to the suppression of the coherent population return, on the other hand, a large fraction of
population typically remains in the excited state at the end of the laser pulse and decays into the sink state thereafter.
As a consequence, in RAP at long interaction times the eﬃciency parameter r, calculated according to Eq. 6, reaches
values larger than those associated to the adiabatic regime. For the parameters considered above the eﬃciency ratio
r was 165 against the minimum value f = 53.8.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have examined a problem to be classiﬁed as a quantum control one: reach a speciﬁc target, the ionization of
the condensate, minimizing the losses into a diﬀerent output channel, the production of thermal atoms. We have
explored diﬀerent two-photon ionization schemes, producing diﬀerent quantum controls for the atomic excited state.
However the quantum control reached for the two-photon ionization is very poor. In eﬀect the ionization process
transferring atoms from the excited state to the ionization state is governed by rate equations, whence a classical
response instead of a quantum one. Our ﬁnal result is that the maximum ionization eﬃciency to be reached through
the quantum control on the ﬁrst excitation, depends on the probabilities of two processes, the spontaneous decay rate
and the ionization rate. These rate are not modiﬁed within the quantum control of our analysis.

While the qualitative behavior of the ionized fraction depends only on the properties of the laser pulse exciting
the ﬁrst step of the ionization sequence, the absolute value of the ionized fraction depends only on the intensity
of the IR light coupling the excited state to the continuum. An analogous statement applies also to the eﬃciency
ratio between the thermal fraction and the ionized fraction. The criteria we have derived for the optimization of the
two-photon ionization have a general validity, whereas the absolute numbers we have discussed correspond to the
intensities available in the analyzed experiment. The fraction of ionized atoms in these conditions is much smaller
than the number of photons scattered by each atom. The application of the optimization criteria we have derived,
however, together with IR intensities larger than those we have considered, will allow to reach experimental conditions
leading to an eﬃcient large photoionization of Bose-Einstein condensates.

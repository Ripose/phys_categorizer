We present extensive and accurate calculations for the excited state spectrum of spin-polarized
neutral helium in a range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths up to 1012 G. Of considerable interest to
models of magnetic white dwarf stellar atmospheres, we also present results for the dipole strengths
of the low lying transitions among these states. Our methods rely on a systematically saturated
basis set approach to solving the Hartree–Fock self-consistent ﬁeld equations, combined with an
“exact” stochastic method to estimate the residual basis set truncation error and electron correlation
eﬀects. We also discuss the applicability of the adiabatic approximation to strongly magnetized
multi-electron atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electronic structure of simple atomic systems in strong external ﬁelds remains poorly understood, despite
considerable theoretical eﬀort. These systems are of critical importance in certain stellar environments, in which very
large magnetic ﬁelds have been inferred [1]. A detailed knowledge of the spectra of light atoms (presumed to dominate
the atmospheres of compact stellar remnants) subjected to intense magnetic ﬁelds would enable both observers and
theorists to better reﬁne their understanding of these astrophysical objects. Unfortunately, only the spectrum of
hydrogen has been adequately treated thus far, by Rosner et al.
in 1984 [2]. This detailed work on hydrogen has
been successfully applied to the observed spectra [3] from many magnetic white dwarf stars, but several stars remain
in which the spectra can not be accounted for by hydrogen [4], and in which the determination of the strength and
conﬁguration of the stellar magnetic ﬁeld would be greatly aided by precise calculations of the spectrum of the next
lightest element, neutral helium.

The diﬃculty in theoretically treating atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds lies in the fact that magnetic and Coulomb
forces are of nearly equal importance; neither can be treated as a perturbation of the other. In the uniform magnetic
ﬁelds that we consider in this work (assumed to lie in the z-direction), this diﬃculty translates into a competition
between the cylindrical symmetry of the applied magnetic ﬁeld, and the spherical symmetry of the Coulomb interac-
tions. An often applied approximation is the adiabatic approximation [5], in which the electronic orbital is assumed to
be a product of a Landau level [3] for the direction transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld (in ρ2 = x2 + y2) and a longitudinal
function (in z) basically determined by the Coulomb interactions.

Several studies have recently addressed the electronic structure of helium atoms subjected to strong magnetic
ﬁelds. Most works have examined only the lowest electronic states using Hartree–Fock (HF) [6–8] and variational
[9,19] methods. To be predictive of observed stellar spectra, however, many excited states are required, not only the
lowest atomic state for a given symmetry. These excited states must also be determined with suﬃciently high accuracy
to distinguish the dominant absorption features found in observed stellar spectra. Several recent attempts have been
made to solve the HF self- consistent ﬁeld (SCF) equations for the spectrum of magnetized helium. Thurner et al.
[11] used numerical quadrature of the HF SCF equations to obtain results for several excited states of helium atoms
and helium-like ions over a range of magnetic ﬁelds up to 1012 G. The errors in this method, however, were best
illustrated by later calculations of Jones et al. [12] who applied a basis set of Slater-type orbitals (STO) in solving
the same equations, and were able to obtain lower energies for two excited states over many symmetries, but only
up to magnetic ﬁeld strengths of 1010 G. Later quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations [13], using these same
STO wave-functions as a starting point, found that the residual basis set truncation errors were still signiﬁcant over
much of the range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths studied, and emphasized the need for more accurate HF wave-functions.
The helium spectrum in strong magnetic ﬁelds is the primary focus of this work. To more accurately determine the

spectrum of neutral helium, we elected to stay within the basis set HF approach and utilize a much more ﬂexible set
of basis functions.

In this paper we use a basis set introduced by Aldrich and Greene [14] in combination with a systematic method
for saturating the basis set [15] to study the lowest energy electronic states of neutral helium. This basis set consists
of functions of the form

where a and b are variational parameters. This basis set has the advantage that it can be used to accurately represent
states in which the charge density is highly anisotropic, where the values of the constants a and b diﬀer. Combined
with our previous method [12] for obtaining excited state solutions to the HF equations, we obtain three excitations
for each of the symmetries studied, with a precision that we estimate to be approximately 0.001 atomic energy
units (hartree). We estimate the remaining basis set truncation error using our released– phase QMC method [13]
which, in principle, is able to obtain the exact energies, including electron correlation. We also provide tables of
dipole strengths calculated for the lowest three excitations of each symmetry, a necessity for accurate modeling of the
absorptive behavior present in the atmospheres of strongly magnetized stars. In the ﬁrst section we brieﬂy review the
methods employed in this study. The second section then presents our results, beginning with the HF energies and
dipole matrix elements, and we consider the implications of our results for the adiabatic approximation. We also use
stochastic methods to determine the correlation energy and estimate the remaining basis set truncation error in the
HF energies. We conclude with some remarks about the applicability of our results to models of the atmospheres of
magnetized compact stellar remnants.

II. METHOD

Our method, apart from the introduction of a diﬀerent basis set, is essentially the same as that of our previous
paper [12]. Here we recapitulate only the essential formulae. The magnetic ﬁeld strength is parameterized by the
constant βZ = β/Z 2 = B/B0Z 2, where B0 = 4.701
109 G = 4701 MG. The Hamiltonian in atomic units for an atom
with N electrons and atomic number Z in constant magnetic ﬁeld (along the z-direction) is given by

where Lz =
respectively, and lengths are in units of the Bohr radius a0. Here we neglect contributions arising from the ﬁnite

nuclear mass. We have chosen the magnetic ﬁeld to be parallel to the z-axis, and the symmetric gauge, which has
vector potential A = B(
y, x, 0)/2. In the absence of external ﬁelds the eigenvalues of L2, Lz, S2, Sz, and parity, Π,
are good quantum numbers. When the magnetic ﬁeld is turned on, the rotational invariance is broken and the only
conserved quantum numbers are the eigenvalues of Lz, S2, Sz, and Π (alternatively, we will use the z-parity, Πz). We
will use both the zero ﬁeld notation, and also the triplet of proper quantum numbers M (the eigenvalue of Lz), πz
and Sz in the form (M, πz, Sz). Taking our wave-function Ψ to be a single Slater determinant and minimizing the
φa(r), where α(s)
energy of the above Hamiltonian with respect to the electronic spin orbitals,
is a spin function, φa(r) a spatial orbital, and x = (s, r)], we obtain the usual Hartree-Fock equations,

,

where mµ denotes the angular momentum quantum number of operator lz, and pµ = 0 for positive z-parity states,
and pµ = 1 for negative z-parity states. The parameters aµ and bµ allow for diﬀerent treatment of the transverse and
longitudinal distance dependence, a crucial consideration when the applied magnetic ﬁeld gets strong enough that the
atom tries to minimize the diamagnetic contribution to the total energy. Analytic expressions can be worked out for
most of the matrix elements, while the nuclear repulsion [14] and electron-electron matrix elements can be reduced to
one dimensional integrals that are performed numerically. Our expressions for the electron–electron matrix elements
can be found in the Appendix.

Our present calculations restrict the orbitals to have a common spatial dependence for two electrons in the same
state but of opposite spin. In other words we use the restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) approach. Details of how we
achieve the solution in this method can be found in Ref. [12].

A. Even-Tempered Gaussians

An important concern in Eq. 6 is whether or not the basis set is suﬃciently well converged for a desired level of
accuracy in the atomic total energy. Previous calculations [12] have been plagued by an inadequate basis set - even
the largest basis sets used have not been well converged in a systematic way. In this work we have used even-tempered
Gaussian (ETG) sequences [15] to systematically saturate the basis set for each electronic orbital. Essentially this
means that a sequence of Ns a and b parameters are generated in such a way that they ﬁll the possible range of values
as each sequence is made longer (Ns increases). In zero ﬁeld calculations only one sequence of spheroidal Gaussians
is needed for each angular momentum type (for Gaussian type orbitals, a = b, and the Gaussian is multiplied by a
spherical harmonic). These sequences of basis elements are given by

bi = b1

δi−1
b

,

·

i = 1, . . . , Ns,

where b1 and δb are the variational parameters for the entire sequence that must be optimized with respect to the HF
total energy. As Ns gets longer, the basis set saturates, or becomes more and more complete. These sequences have
been successfully used for well saturated zero ﬁeld atomic calculations [15], a case in which the parameters a and b
are equal. It should be emphasized that these ETG sequences are simply a reliable way in which the basis set can be
saturated. In practice, we fully optimize the values of the basis set parameters for each value of Ns, the length of the
sequences, with respect to the total energy. One can then also ﬁt the resulting optimal parameters in order to obtain
a scheme for extrapolating to even larger basis set sizes (sequence lengths) [15]. However, we have not done this
extrapolation procedure, as the optimal sequences are suﬃciently well converged in energy to meet our requirements
for the accuracy of the total energy.

The main complication in the present application is that our basis set (Eq. 7) is designed to break spherical
symmetry (a
= b), such that we have two parameters in each Gaussian basis function, separately describing the
longitudinal and transverse directions. To compensate for this separation, we use a series of such ETG sequences,
with the longitudinal parameters given by Eq. 8, and the matching transverse parameters given by

where f is a constant factor. We have typically selected f such that we use a series of 2
5 even-tempered sequences
for each orbital, with f = 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . . Note that the total number of basis functions is Ns multiplied by the number
of diﬀerent sequences. Additionally we have included a sequence such that a is ﬁxed, a = aB, where aB = Z 2βZ/2 is
the exponential parameter for the ﬁrst Landau level of an electron in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. As the magnetic ﬁeld
gets larger, this Landau level sequence becomes more and more important in the basis set expansion of the electronic
orbitals. The adiabatic approximation corresponds to using only sequences in which a is ﬁxed to aB. We will explore
this issue further below.

Our desired accuracy for the HF total energies is 0.001 hartree, such that we can resolve transitions in the optical
regime with a precision of δλ . 100˚A, where λ = hc/
is the wavelength of allowed transitions between initial
Ef |
and ﬁnal states. Our RHF calculations reported here used a minimum of 2 ETG sequences for each orbital, with some
calculations using up to 5 sequences. The convergence of the total energy as a function of the number of sequences
was carefully checked at several diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths (typically βZ = 1, 10, 100), and was converged to
within 0.0005 hartree. It was necessary to include the Landau level sequence (ai = aB) for the 1s orbital for βZ & 1,
while it was always necessary (apart from βZ = 0) to include the Landau level sequence for the second electronic
orbital, due to the much greater impact of the applied ﬁeld on the outermost electron. We began calculations with
each sequence having a length of four (Ns = 4 in Eq. 8) and fully optimized the parameters for each sequence (two
parameters for each sequence). This process was repeated until the energy converged within 0.0001 hartree, which

typically required a length of Ns = 6
third (inset) states of symmetry (M, πz, Sz) = (0, +,
1). The total energy in this example is amply converged by
Ns = 7. Note that we have chosen more stringent cut-oﬀs for the convergence of the total energy with respect to the
number and length of ETG sequences; thus the desired accuracy of 0.001 hartree is a conservative estimate of the
remaining basis set truncation error.

possess a nonzero derivative at the origin. The ETG basis elements are much better, however, at reproducing the
highly anisotropic behavior at high magnetic ﬁelds. This improved accuracy is reﬂected in the fact that the higher
excited states are much superior to those published previously [12].

The spectrum of the energy states computed thus far is shown in Figure 2. We note that the most tightly bound
states (the ﬁrst states of (
1) symmetry) lie lowest in energy, by a considerable margin,
with a gap to higher excitations that increases monotonically with applied ﬁeld strength. The remaining states form a
broad band of excitations whose width is slowly increasing as a function of magnetic ﬁeld strength. It should be noted
that many additional tightly bound states lie between the band of excitations and the lowest tightly bound (

truncation error, which is not unexpected, as the HF-SCF wave-functions are optimized according to energy, leaving
other expectation values more sensitive to the basis set error.

C. Validity of the Adiabatic Approximation

In the often used adiabatic approximation [5], the only basis functions used are those corresponding to the lowest
Landau level, while the functional dependence in the longitudinal direction is allowed to vary. We assess the validity
of such an approximation by measuring the relative average transverse “widths” of the electron orbitals, namely

(cid:12)
where φ1 corresponds to the ﬁrst (1s) orbital, and φ2 the second, excited state, orbital. If the adiabatic approximation
(cid:12)
is valid, this ratio of the widths of the second electron compared to the ﬁrst should approach a constant (see Eq. 14).
We show examples of this width for the 1s2p−1, 1s3p−1 and 1s4p−1 states in Fig. 4. The lower panel shows the width
for all values of the applied magnetic ﬁeld, while the upper panel focuses on the region where βZ & 1. We note that
the ratio only approaches a constant for the very largest ﬁeld strengths, βZ & 80
100, and is still slowly varying
even in this super-strong ﬁeld regime. The ratio is also only slightly dependent on the degree of excitation.

We see that, in the adiabatic limit, the expectation value of ρ2 for each electronic orbital should be a simple constant
divided by the magnetic ﬁeld strength. Figures 5 and 6 plot this expectation value as a function of 1/βZ for the
same example states that we considered above, the 1s2p−1, 1s3p−1 and 1s4p−1 states. Figure 5 plots
for the ﬁrst
electronic orbital of helium (the 1s state at zero magnetic ﬁeld), while Figure 6 shows the same result for the second
orbital. We see in Figure 5 that the approach to the adiabatic limit (indicated by the dashed line, whose slope is 1/4
by Eq. 14) is really not valid until βZ & 50, a very large ﬁeld indeed (about 1012 G). We also note that the limit is
reached at approximately the same value of ﬁeld strength for all three states, a reasonable result, as the innermost
electron should not be greatly diﬀerent from one excited state to the next. The second orbital, however, reaches the
adiabatic limit much more quickly, as we see from Figure 6. The more spatially extended states feel a much larger
eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld (due to the diamagnetic term in the Hamiltonian); thus the tightly bound 2p−1 state (given
by the triangles) reaches the adiabatic limit (indicated by the dashed line of slope 1/2) more slowly (βZ ≃
5) than
0.2. The implications of these
the next two excited states, which are very near the adiabatic regime at βZ ≃
results for multi-electron atoms is that the adiabatic approximation is not good for the innermost electrons, except at
extremely large ﬁeld strengths, due to the importance of the Coulomb repulsion from the nucleus. Thus we conclude
that the adiabatic approximation for multi-electron atoms is seldom very accurate, even for the large magnetic ﬁelds
found in magnetized white dwarfs and neutron stars, which is generally less than 1012 G.

D. Basis Set Truncation Error and Correlation Energy

To provide an estimation of the size of our basis set truncation error, we have used two quantum Monte Carlo
methods. The ﬁxed–phase method [17] (FPQMC) is a variational method that projects out the ground state of a
particular symmetry using stochastic random walks. If the state were bosonic, FPQMC would yield an exact result
(albeit with statistical error bars) for the total energy. Since we have fermions, the FPQMC energies are an upper
bound to the exact total energy (often a very good upper bound) for the ground state of a given symmetry, whose
quality is constrained by the ﬁxed–phase approximation. The released–phase method [13] (RPQMC) is an “exact”
method that can simultaneously determine the ground and excited states by using correlation functions in imaginary
time. If suﬃciently well converged in imaginary time, this RPQMC method obtains the exact energies, but always
provides at least an upper bound to the exact excited state energies. Both of these methods, along with an earlier
application to low-lying excited states of helium (for smaller and somewhat inferior STO basis sets), are reviewed in
Ref. [18]. It is diﬃcult, of course, to separate out the basis set truncation errors from the correlation energy,

EC = EHF −

EQMC .

(15)

Our ETG basis set should be equally valid at all ﬁeld strengths, hence we can look for basis set error by examining the
behavior of the correlation energy as a function of ﬁeld strength. Errors arising from truncation of the basis set should
show up as (small) perturbations on the otherwise smooth correlation energy curve. The behavior of the correlation
energy for the lowest state of each of the eight symmetries studied is shown in Fig. 7. From the small oscillations in
the correlation energy curves we estimate, for the range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths 0
1, that the truncation
error is generally less than 0.001 hartree. For larger ﬁelds the truncation error increases. We note that EC increases
slowly with applied ﬁeld strength, except for the most tightly bound states, which have zero ﬁeld quantum numbers
1s2p−1, 1s3d−2, and 1s4f−3, which increase rather dramatically as the ﬁeld strength grows larger.

βZ ≤

Table IX compares our current RPQMC results for a selected set of magnetic ﬁeld strengths and all eight symmetries
studied with our previous RPQMC results [13]. We note that the previous results suﬀered from poor wave-function
quality, as the present results (the method, when insuﬃciently converged in imaginary time, remains variational) are
greatly improved, especially for the higher excitations. We also note that the correlation energy is quite small for the
highest excitations, regardless of the symmetry state. This reduction in correlation energy for the highest excitations
is most likely due to the large physical separation between the innermost and outermost electrons.

≤

E. Comparison with Other Calculations

For our HF-ETG results we have already noted a favorable comparison with the best HF excited state calculations
in the literature [12]. For our fully correlated RPQMC results we compare, in Table X, with the recent work of
Scrinzi [19], who applied a variational calculation with a correlated basis to the ﬁrst three excitations of M = 0
1, and Becken et al. [20], who performed a very large conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculation for the
and M =
M = 0 symmetries, with up to six excited states. We note that our results compare favorably with the calculations
of Becken et al., at least for the symmetries that they have computed thus far, while there are large discrepancies
with the results of Scrinzi. Some of Scrinzi’s values for the total energy are considerably lower in energy than both
our RPQMC results and the CI values. The agreement between the distinctly diﬀerent CI and RPQMC methods is
reassuring, and it seems most likely that these anomalously low energies of Scrinzi reﬂect numerical errors.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have applied a systematic method of basis-set saturation within the Hartree–Fock formalism for the case of
neutral helium in strong magnetic ﬁelds, obtaining an accuracy of approximately 0.001 hartree atomic units over a
wide range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths. The resulting accuracy in determining wavelengths for transitions among these
states is thus δλ/λ . 0.0021/∆EHF , for βZ . 1. For optical transitions, this accuracy is . 2%. Unfortunately, the
dipole matrix elements also have truncation errors, which are much more diﬃcult to estimate.

Using our accurate HF-ETG wave-functions, we have used quantum Monte Carlo methods to determine the cor-
relation energy (the diﬀerence between Hartree–Fock and the exact total energy) and estimate the residual basis set
truncation energies. We have also evaluated the validity of the adiabatic approximation, and found that it is poor for
the lowest lying states and magnetic ﬁeld strengths. For example, the ground state of neutral helium does not enter
the adiabatic regime until βZ & 50.

APPENDIX: ELECTRON–ELECTRON MATRIX ELEMENT

The strategy that we have used for the electron–electron matrix elements reduces the six dimensional integral to
a one dimensional one that can be rapidly evaluated using standard numerical quadrature methods. The matrix
elements between basis functions of the form Eq. 7,

I ee
µνλσ =

χµ(r1)χλ(r2)

χν(r1)χσ(r2)

,

(cid:28)

can be expanded using the identity

We now expand the three dimensional integral over k in cylindrical coordinates kρ, kz and kϕ,

FIG. 4. The ratio of the expectation value of ρ2 for the second electronic orbital relative to the ﬁrst for the ﬁrst three excited
states of (M, πz, Sz) = (−1, +, −1) symmetry. The upper panel is a close-up of the data for larger ﬁeld strengths. The ratio
should approach 2.0 in the adiabatic limit. Lines are provided only as a guide to the eye.

FIG. 5. The expectation value of ρ2 for the ﬁrst HF electronic orbital φ1 as a function of magnetic ﬁeld strength, which
should become linear in the limit when the adiabatic approximation is valid. Three orbitals are shown, corresponding to the
ﬁrst three excitations of (M, πz, Sz) = (−1, +, −1) symmetry. The inset shows a close-up of the super-strong ﬁeld regime near
the origin. The dashed line indicates the adiabatic limit. Solid lines are provided only as a guide to the eye.

TABLE IX. Comparison of Released–Phase QMC results, ERP , with the current ETG Hartree–Fock energies, EET G

HF , and
the best previous RP results from Ref. 18. Blanks are left for the entries for which no previous RP calculations were done.
Fixed–Phase QMC results, EF P , are also shown for the lowest excited state of each symmetry. We note that the previous
RP results, Ref. 18, are considerably improved for the higher excitations, which reﬂect the higher quality of the present HF
wave-functions.

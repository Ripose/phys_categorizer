Abstract

Detection of high-redshift absorption in the optical spectra of quasars have
provided a powerful tool to measure spatial and temporal variations of physi-
cal “constants” in the Universe. It is demonstrated that high sensitivity to the
variation of the ﬁne structure constant α can be obtained from a comparison
of the spectra of heavy and light atoms (or molecules). We have performed
calculations for the pair FeII and MgII for which accurate quasar and labora-
tory spectra are available. A possibility of 105 times enhanced eﬀects of the
fundamental constants variation suitable for laboratory measurements is also
discussed.

The ﬁrst ideas about possible variation of the fundamental physical constants in the
expanding Universe were suggested by Dirac [1]. Now this subject is of particular current
interest because of the new possibilities opened up by the structure of uniﬁed theories, like
the string theory and M-theory, which lead us to expect that additional compact dimensions
of space may exist. The “constants” seen in the three-dimensional subspace of the theory
will vary at the same rate as any change occurring in the extra compact dimensions (see,
e.g. [2–4]).

Quasar absorption systems present ideal laboratories where to search for any temporal
or spatial variation of fundamental constants by comparing atomic spectra from the distant
objects with the laboratory spectra (see, e.g. [5] and references therein).

The energy scale of the atomic spectra is given by the atomic unit me4
¯h

2 . In the absence
of any corrections, all atomic spectra are proportional to this constant and no change of
the fundamental constants can be detected. Indeed, any change in the atomic unit will be
absorbed in the determination of the red shift parameter 1 + z = ω
ω′ which is also found from
the comparison between the cosmic and laboratory atomic spectra (ω′ is the red-shifted
frequency of the atomic transition and ω is this frequency in the laboratory). However,
any change of the fundamental constants can be found by measuring the relative size of
relativistic corrections, which are proportional to α2, where α = e2/¯hc is the ﬁne structure
constant [6].

It would seem natural to ﬁnd this change from measurements of the spin-orbit splitting
within a ﬁne-structure multiplet. However, this way is not the most eﬃcient, and it may
even give incorrect results, since other relativistic eﬀects are ignored. The aim of this letter
is to demonstrate that the change in α produces an order of magnitude larger eﬀect in
the diﬀerence between transition frequencies in heavy and light atoms (or molecules). We
have calculated the dependence of the transition frequencies on α for FeII (see eq.(8)) and
MgII (see eq.(6)) where accurate data exist both for laboratory and quasar spectra. Other
possibilities include comparisons of diﬀerent optical transitions, for example s − p and p − d,
in the same atom or molecule, or comparisons of microwave transitions in molecules which
contain rotational and hyperﬁne intervals.

We also propose another interesting possibility: to use transitions between “accidentally”
degenerate levels in the same atom or molecule. This degeneracy would disappear after a
minor change in α. For example, in the Dy atom there are two degenerate opposite-parity
levels [7,8]. The frequency of the E1-transition between them is smaller then the hyperﬁne
splitting of each level. As a result, the relative eﬀect of the change in α is enhanced by ﬁve
orders of magnitude (the ratio of the size of the relativistic eﬀect to the transition frequency).
This case seems to be more suitable for laboratory experiments. Similar experiments with
“accidentally” degenerate molecular levels belonging to diﬀerent electron terms are also
sensitive to the smallest changes in the ratio of the nucleon to electron masses since in this
case the diﬀerence in electron energies is compensated by the diﬀerence in the vibrational
and rotational energies of the nuclei. As is known, the nuclear mass is a function of the
strong interaction constants and vacuum condensates.

A competitive possibility is an accurate measurement of a very small diﬀerence between
the frequencies of two transitions in diﬀerent atoms or molecules (like in the comparison with
the frequency standard). This small diﬀerence can be measured with a very high absolute
accuracy, up to few Hz, and one can have the same enhanced eﬀects of the change in α or

2

the nucleon mass.

Let us start our calculations from simple analytical estimates of the relativistic eﬀects
in transition frequencies. Consider ﬁrst the relativistic corrections to the frequency of an
atomic transition in a hydrogen-like atom. The relativistic correction to the energy level is
given by (see, e.g. [9])

where Z is the nuclear charge, n is the principal quantum number and j is the total electron
angular momentum. This value of the relativistic correction can be obtained as an expecta-
tion value hV i of the relativistic perturbation V , which is large in the vicinity of the nucleus
only. Therefore, the relativistic correction ∆ is proportional to the electron density near the
nucleus |Ψ(r < a
Z is the size of the hydrogen-like ion). For
an external electron in a many-electron atom or ion the electron density near the nucleus is
given by the formula (see, e.g. [10]) obtained in the semiclassical approximation (n ≫ 1)

number, deﬁned by En = − me4
ν2 , where En is the energy of the electron. For hydrogen-

like ions ν = n, Za = Z. Thus, to ﬁnd the single-particle relativistic correction, we should

multiply ∆ in Eq. (1) by the ratio of |Ψ(r < a

The second term in the square brackets is presented to provide a continuous transition from
the hydrogen-like ion Eq.
In multi-electron ions
(1) to the multi-electron ion Eq.
(Z ≫ Za) this term is, in fact, a rough estimate based on the direct calculation of hV i. We
should neglect this small term since there are more important many-body corrections (the
accurate many-body calculations discussed below give approximately constant correction
term in square brackets with the value about −0.6).

(2).

We see that the relativistic correction is largest for the s1/2 and p1/2 states, where j = 1/2.

The ﬁne structure splitting is given by

∆ls = E(p3/2) − E(p1/2) ≃ −∆(p1/2)/2 ≃ −∆(p3/2).

(3)

In the quasar absorption spectra transitions from the ground state have been observed.
Therefore, it is important to understand how the frequencies of these transitions are aﬀected
by the relativistic eﬀects. The ﬁne splitting in excited states is smaller then the relativistic
correction in the ground state, since the density of the excited electron near the nucleus is
smaller. As a result, the ﬁne splitting of the E1-transition from the ground state (e.g., s − p)
is substantially smaller than the absolute shift of the frequency of the s − p transition. The
mean energy of the p-electron is deﬁned as

where En is the non-relativistic energy. Therefore, the relativistic shift of the mean s − p
transition frequency is given by

∆(p − s) ≃ −

3
The relative size of the relativistic corrections is proportional to Z 2, so they are small in
light atoms. Therefore, we can ﬁnd the change of α by comparing transition frequencies in
heavy and light atoms. We stress that the most accurate and eﬀective procedure to search
for the change of α must include all relativistic corrections and the analysis of all available
lines (rather then the ﬁne splitting within one multiplet only).

∆ls − ∆(s1/2).

Let us consider an example of the s − p transitions from the ground state in MgII (Z=12)
and FeII (Z=26) ions where accurate data exist for both laboratory and quasar spectra (see
detailed analysis in [11–13]). MgII is a simple system with one external electron above closed
shells. The frequency of the transition can be presented in the following form

E(3p1/2) − E(3s1/2) = El(3p1/2) − El(3s1/2) + K1[( α
αl
E(3p3/2) − E(3s1/2) = El(3p3/2) − El(3s1/2) + K2[( α
αl

)2 − 1]
)2 − 1]

K1 ≃ −2∆ls − ∆(3s1/2) ,
K2 ≃ −∆ls − ∆(3s1/2).

Here αl and El are the laboratory values of ﬁne structure constant and energy, α and E are
the values at the distant object. The formulae (2)-(3) for the spin-orbit splitting ∆ls and
relativistic shift ∆(3s1/2) have been obtained in the single-particle approximation. There are
large corrections to these formulae due to partial electron screening of the nuclear potential,
which appears in the equation for the relativistic correction hV i, and due to a change of
the total atomic potential acting on external electron when we change α. Indeed, the wave
functions of all inner electrons change due to the relativistic corrections (Ψ → Ψ + δΨ),
which in turn produces a change in the mean-ﬁeld atomic potential (V → V + δV ).
In
part these eﬀects can be taken into account by using the experimental value of ∆ls = 91.6
cm−1 and the semiempirical formula for ∆(3s) = −2∆ls( ν3p
)3 = −3.37∆ls = −309 cm−1
ν3s
obtained from Eqs. (2)-(3). This yields K1 = 126 cm−1 and K2 = 217.6 cm−1. To obtain
more accurate values of K1 and K2 we performed calculations of the MgII spectra using
many-body perturbation theory. We have used the complete set of the relativistic Hartree-
Fock energies and wave functions as a zero approximation and then calculated all second-
order correlation corrections in the residual electron-electron interaction (this technique is
described in [14]). This ab initio calculation reproduces the experimental energy levels of
the external electron with 0.2% accuracy (the single-electron energy levels in the many-
body problem are deﬁned as the ionization energies with a minus sign). To ﬁnd the value
of relativistic corrections we performed calculations for the two values of α : α = αl and
α = αl/2. The calculated relativistic corrections to the energy levels of the external electron
are :∆(3s) = −189.4, ∆(3p1/2) = −72.1, ∆(3p3/2) = 24.4, ∆ls = 96.5cm−1. Note that the
many-body corrections change the sign of ∆(3p3/2). The ﬁnal results are the following:

(6)

We changed slightly the values of the calculated coeﬃcients K1 and K2 to reproduce exactly
the experimental value of the ﬁne splitting ∆ls = 91.6cm−1. The laboratory frequency of
the 3s1/2 − 3p3/2 transition in the main isotope 24Mg (abundance 79 %) has been taken from
[12]. The increase of the frequencies (isotope shifts) for the transition in 25Mg (abundance
10 %) and 26Mg (abundance 11 %) are equal to 0.053 and 0.102 cm−1, respectively [12]. The
laboratory frequency of the 3s1/2 − 3p1/2 transition has been taken from [11].

6F and

6D9/2 to the members of the multiplets 3d64p 6D,

Now consider FeII. We are interested in the E1-transition from the ground state
3d64s
6P . Due to the
selection rule ∆J ≤ 1 the transitions from the ground state J = 9/2 can involve only few
components of the excited multiplets. The splitting between the nearby components of the
same multiplet (e.g. J = 9/2 and J = 7/2) are about 100 - 200 cm−1. On the other hand,
the total relativistic correction to the mean frequency of the 4s − 4p transition is about 1800
cm−1, i.e. ∼ 10 times larger! Unfortunately, we can not measure the eﬀect of this large
correction by measuring the frequency of 4s − 4p transitions in one element (FeII) since it
will be hidden in the deﬁnition of the red shift parameter 1 + z. Therefore, to make use of
this large eﬀect we need to consider two elements with diﬀerent relativistic shifts, e.g. MgII
and FeII, or diﬀerent transitions in the same element, e.g. s − p and d − p.

We can also consider s − p transitions to the diﬀerent multiplets. However, the relativis-
tic eﬀects in the diﬀerences between the central energy points E0 of diﬀerent multiplets (
D, F and P ) are substantially smaller ( ∼ 100 - 200 cm−1) than the relativistic shift of the
s − p transition frequency, since these diﬀerences are due to the dependence of the Coulomb
interaction Q between external electrons on the relativistic correction to their wave func-
tions (∆ω ∼ QZ 2α2 where Q is the non-diagonal matrix element of the Coulomb interaction
producing conﬁguration mixing). There are also small relativistic corrections to the inter-
val between the diﬀerent multiplets due to the second order in the spin-orbit interaction.
However, the relativistic eﬀect in the diﬀerence of the frequencies of particular components
of diﬀerent multiplets can be larger. The maximal relativistic shift in the diﬀerences of the
FeII frequencies (for the transitions which have been observed in the quasar spectra) is 387
cm−1 in the diﬀerence between 6F9/2 and 6P7/2 (see below).

In principle, approximate calculations of the average relativistic frequency shift of the
4s − 4p transition and the dependence of the ﬁne structure intervals on α could be done
using semiempirical formulae (2) - (5) which give average the shift 1550 cm−1, and laboratory
experimental data. However, to calculate accurately the relativistic shift for each transition
we performed relativistic many-body calculations for energy levels of FeII.

1. We used averaged relativistic Hartree-Fock potential of the FeIII d6 state to generate

a complete set of the zeroth approximation wave functions and energies.

2. Correlations of the second-order in the residual Coulomb interaction between the va-
lence and core electrons were included by means of the correlation potential (self -
energy operator) method [14].

3. Most of the valence correlations were included by means of a conﬁguration interaction
method. Excited conﬁgurations were constructed from the s, p and d single-electron

5

Hartree-Fock states with n ≤ 6 (17 single-electron orbitals). Only those conﬁgurations
were included that can be obtained by a single or double-electron excitation from the
main conﬁguration. Thus, the total number of conﬁgurations was few hundred. This
is a rather small-scale conﬁguration interaction and full convergence was not achieved.
However, good agreement with experimental data for the energy levels shows that a
greater part of the valence correlations were included.

4. To imitate the eﬀect of higher-order many-body corrections we introduced two ﬁtting
parameters. The ab initio correlation potentials for the s and p electrons were mul-
tiplied by the factors fs = 0.94 and fp = 0.9, respectively. These factors imitated
the eﬀect of screening of the Coulomb interaction between the core and valence elec-
trons which reduces the correlations between these electrons (accurate calculation of
this screening has been done in [14]). The values of fs and fp were chosen to ﬁt the
ionization energies of the 3d64s and 3d64p states.

To ﬁnd the dependence of frequencies on α we use the following formula for the energy levels
within one ﬁne-structure multiplet:

E = E0 + Q1((

Here L is the total orbital angular momentum and S is the total electron spin. We introduce
an (LS)2 term to describe deviations from the Lande interval rule. There are two sources of
the (LS)2 term: the second order in the spin-orbit interaction (∼ (Zα)4 = 1.3 × 10−3) and
the ﬁrst order in the spin-spin interaction (∼ α2 = 5.3 × 10−5). In FeII the second-order
spin-orbit interaction is larger. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁtted the experimental ﬁne structure
intervals to ﬁnd K1 and K2 (numerical calculations give close values of K1 and K2). Then
we used numerical calculations for α = αl and α = αl/2 to ﬁnd the dependence of the
conﬁguration centers E0 on α (coeﬃcient Q1). The coeﬃcients Q1, K1 and K2 are presented
in table I. Very accurate values of the laboratory frequencies (α = αl) can be found in [13].
The errors are about 0.003 cm−1. The Fe atom has one dominating isotope 56Fe (92 %) and
small isotope shifts. Now we can use Eq. (7) and table I to calculate the frequencies of the
E1 transitions from the ground state (in cm−1) as functions of α:

6D J = 9/2 ω = 38458.9871 + 1394x + 38y,
J = 7/2 ω = 38660.0494 + 1632x + 0y,
6F J = 11/2 ω = 41968.0642 + 1622x + 3y,
J = 9/2 ω = 42114.8329 + 1772x + 0y,
J = 7/2 ω = 42237.0500 + 1894x + 0y,
6P J = 7/2 ω = 42658.2404 + 1398x − 13y,

)4 − 1. One can use Eqs. (6) and (8) to ﬁt FeII and MgII lines
where x = ( α

in the quasar spectra and ﬁnd the variation of α. Note that besides FeII one can use s − p
transitions from the ground state of GeII, ZnII, NiI, FeI, MnII, CaI and CaII, where the
relativistic corrections have the same order of magnitude, and any light atom besides MgII.
One more interesting possibility more suitable for a laboratory experiment is to use tran-
sitions between “accidentally” degenerate levels in the same atom. Such meta-stable levels
exist, for example, in the Dy atom: two J = 10 opposite parity levels 4f 105d6s and 4f 95d26s

6

lying 19797.96 cm−1 above ground state.( This pair of levels was used to study parity non-
conservation in Refs. [7,8]). There are other examples of “accidentally” degenerate levels
in the rare-earth and actinide atoms and many close levels in other heavy atoms and ions
(in the absence of degeneracy one should look for s − d or s − p transitions where the rel-
ativistic eﬀects are larger). In the case of “accidental” degeneracy the contributions of the
relativistic corrections to the frequency of the E1 transition in a heavy atom (∼ 1000cm−1)
is compensated by the diﬀerence in the Coulomb interaction energies of the two conﬁgura-
tions. However, if α varies with time, this compensation will eventually disappear. Thus,
we have a correction ∼ 1000 cm−1(( α
)2 − 1) to the very small ( ¡ 0.01 cm−1) frequency
αl
of the transition. One can measure, for example, the time dependence of the ratio of fre-
quencies for transitions between the hyperﬁne components of these two states. In the case
of “accidentally” degenerate levels belonging to diﬀerent electron terms in a molecule one
can have enhanced eﬀects of the change of both α and the nucleon mass. In the latter case
the enhancement factor is the ratio of the vibration energy to the small frequency of the
transition.

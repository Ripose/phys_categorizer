Abstract

We report the use of photoassociative spectroscopy to determine the ground state s-wave scatter-

ing lengths for the main bosonic isotopes of strontium, 86Sr and 88Sr. Photoassociative transitions

are driven with a laser red-detuned by up to 1400 GHz from the 1S0 - 1P1 atomic resonance at

461 nm. A minimum in the transition amplitude for 86Sr at

494

5 GHz allows us to determine the

scattering lengths 610 a0 < a86 < 2300 a0 for 86Sr and a much smaller value of

1 a0 < a88 < 13 a0

Photoassociative spectroscopy (PAS) of ultracold gases, in which a laser ﬁeld resonantly

excites colliding atoms to ro-vibrational states of excited molecular potentials, is a powerful

probe of atomic cold collisions [1]. Transition frequencies have been used to obtain dispersion

coeﬃcients of molecular potentials, which yield the most accurate value of the atomic excited-

state lifetime[2, 3, 4]. Transition amplitudes are related to the wave-function for colliding

ground state atoms [5, 6], and can be used to determine the ground state s-wave scattering

length [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

The s-wave scattering length is a crucial parameter for determining the eﬃciency of

evaporative cooling and the stability of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). It also sets the

scale for collisional frequency shifts, which can limit the accuracy and stability of atomic

frequency standards.

The cold collision properties of alkaline-earth atoms like strontium, calcium, and magne-

sium, and atoms with similar electronic structure such as ytterbium, are currently the focus

of intense study. These atoms posses narrow optical resonances that have great potential

for optical frequency standards [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Laser-cooling on narrow transitions is

an eﬃcient route to high phase-space density [18, 19], and a BEC was recently produced

with ytterbium [20]. Fundamental interest in alkaline-earth atoms is also high because their

simple molecular potentials allow accurate tests of cold collision theory [21, 22, 23].

PAS of calcium [11] and ytterbium [12] was recently used to determine s-wave scattering

lengths of these atoms. This paper reports the use of PAS to determine the ground state

s-wave scattering lengths for the main bosonic isotopes of strontium, 86Sr and 88Sr, which

have relative abundances of 10% and 83% respectively. We ﬁnd a huge scattering length for

86Sr of 610 a0 < a86 < 2300 a0. Appreciable uncertainty comes from the value of C6 for the
ground state potential. In contrast, for 88Sr we ﬁnd

1 a0 < a88 < 13 a0. From the data, we

also make an improved measurement [4] of the 5s5p 1P1 atomic lifetime (τ = 5.25

For PAS of strontium, atoms are initially trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) oper-

ating on the 461 nm 1S0 - 1P1 transition, as described in [4, 25]. We are able to produce pure

samples of each isotope from the same atomic beam due to the intrinsic isotope selectivity

of a MOT. For 86Sr and 88Sr respectively, about 7

107 and 2.5

108 atoms are trapped

and cooled to 2 mK.

After this stage, the 461 nm laser-cooling light is extinguished, the ﬁeld gradient is reduced

to 0.1 G/cm, and 689 nm light for the 1S0 - 3P1 intercombination-line MOT [26] is switched

on. This MOT consists of three retro-reﬂected beams, each with a diameter of 2 cm and

intensity of 400

800 µW/cm2. Initially, the frequency of the laser-cooling light is detuned

from atomic resonance by about -1.3 MHz, and spectrally broadened with a

1.0 MHz sine-

wave modulation.

During a 50 ms transfer and equilibration period, the ﬁeld gradient and spectral modu-

lation are linearly ramped to 0.8 G/cm and

0.7 MHz. The detuning is ramped to about

-0.9 MHz. This yields about 4

3. The intercombination-line MOT parameters are then held constant during

2

×

an adjustable hold time. In the absence of PAS, the lifetime of atoms in the trap is about

500 ms, limited by background gas collisions.

The size of the atom cloud, the number of atoms, and thus the peak density are pri-

marily determined with absorption imaging using the 1S0 - 1P1 transition. We image along
the direction of gravity, and transverse 1/√e density radii are σ = 250 µm for 86Sr and

σ = 400 µm for 88Sr. To obtain information on the cloud dimension along gravity [27],

an additional camera monitors ﬂuorescence perpendicular to this direction. The cloud is

smaller by approximately a factor of two in this axis.

To excite photoassociative resonances, a PAS laser, tuned to the red of the atomic 1S0 -

1P1 transition at 461 nm, is applied to the atoms during hold times of 200

800 ms. When the

−

PAS laser is tuned to a molecular resonance, photoassociation provides a loss mechanism for

the MOT, decreasing the number of atoms. The PAS laser has negligible eﬀect on the atom

cloud size or temperature. When the PAS light is tuned far from a molecular resonance, it

has no eﬀect on the rate of loss from the trap.

PAS light is generated from an extended cavity diode laser at 922 nm using second-

harmonic generation in a linear enhancement cavity [28]. The laser linewidth is 80 MHz in

the blue on a millisecond time scale, which contributes signiﬁcantly to the observed PAS

resonance linewidths. The laser frequency is measured with a wavemeter that is regularly

calibrated with the cooling laser whose frequency is locked to the atomic 1S0 - 1P1 transition.

The resulting 1-sigma statistical uncertainty for frequency measurements of the PAS laser

is 200 MHz. There is also a comparable systematic uncertainty due to the sensitivity of the

Detuning [GHz]

FIG. 1: Selected region of the 86Sr PAS spectrum. The detuning is of the PAS laser with respect

to the atomic 1S0 - 1P1 transition frequency. The vertical axis is the fraction of atoms remaining

at the end of the hold time in comparison to the number in the absence of photoassociation. PAS

laser intensity is 800 mW/cm2, and hold times range from 350 to 450 ms. The minimum of the

transition amplitude occurs when the Condon radius corresponds to a zero of the ground state

wave function. The insets show the quality of the data and the ﬁts to Eqs. 1 and 2.

wavementer to the alignment of the laser into the device.

The available PAS laser power is as high as 20 mW. Several beam geometries are used,

but typically the PAS beam is retroreﬂected, with a 1/e2 intensity radius of about w = 1

mm, yielding a maximum intensity of 3 W/cm2 on the atoms. Lower intensities are obtained

using an AOM. For some data, a quarter-wave plate is inserted in the beam path after the

ﬁrst pass through the atoms to prevent the formation of a standing wave. This variation

has no noticeable aﬀect on the PAS intensity and frequency measurements.

The observed PAS spectrum is relatively simple because the bosonic isotopes of strontium

lack hyperﬁne structure. In addition, at the low temperatures of the intercombination-line

MOT, only s-wave collisions occur so only J = 1 levels are excited. Ground state 1S0 atoms

overlap. We approximate the density distribution as a Gaussian. The one-body loss rate

(Γ) and n0 are ﬁxed at values determined from independent measurements. Fit values of N0

agree well with independent measurements and are a check of the method.

where fv is the center frequency for the transition. The experimental linewidth, γ

≈
150 MHz, approximately equals the sum of the natural radiative linewidth for the tran-

sition, γv = 61 MHz [4], and the measured laser linewidth.
Including the factor γv/γ in
Eq. 2 accounts for broadening beyond γv[29, 30]. Ipk is in units of mW/cm2, and Kv is
the collision rate constant, on resonance, for 1 mW/cm2 intensity from an ideal laser with

negligible linewidth. Diﬃculty in accurately determining the spatial dimensions of the atom

cloud and in aligning the PAS laser beam on the atoms leads to systematic uncertainties of

about a factor of two in measurements of Kv (Figs. 2 and 3). Except for the most intense

PAS transitions close to atomic resonance for 86Sr, the linear variation with intensity used

in Eq. 2 is a good approximation and Kv is a constant for each transition.

From the observed transition frequencies we can obtain an accurate value of the atomic

5s5p 1P1 lifetime, τ . For the region of the molecular potentials probed by PAS, the transition

energies can be described with the semiclassical approximation [31]

vD is a non-integer quantum number corresponding to a hypothetical level at the dissociation

limit. Relativistic retardation, rotational energy, higher order dispersion terms, ground state

potential curvature, thermal shifts, and all light-induced shifts are negligible at our level of

accuracy. A ﬁt to the 86Sr data yields τ = 5.25

0.01 ns. The 88Sr data is not extensive

enough to contribute to the determination.

While all the data in Figs. 2 and 3 are valuable, the detunings of the laser corresponding to

minima of the PAS rate are particularly important. At these detunings, the Condon radius

to saying the overlap integral between the ground- and excited-state wavefunctions van-

ishes. Minima positions provide precise enough information about ground-state potentials

and wavefunctions to determine s-wave scattering lengths to high accuracy. The minima

positions are also independent of atom density and laser intensity calibrations, and for the

ultracold gases used here, they are independent of T , the temperature of the atoms.

For our analysis, the inner part (R < 19 a0) of ground- and excited-state potentials are

formed by an experimental RKR potential [33] and ab initio potential [34] respectively.

These are smoothly connected to the multipolar van der Waals expansion in Cn/Rn at large

internuclear separation. For the excited-state potential, only the C3 term contributes, and

we use the value determined above. For the ground-state potential, C6, C8 and C10 terms are

included [35, 36, 37]. Relativistic retardation eﬀects in the asymptotic part of the excited-

state potential are treated as described in [4]. Wave functions are calculated using a full

quantum calculation. For the bound vibrational levels, the Mapped Fourier Grid Method

[38] has been used whereas the ground-state continuum wave function was calculated using

a Numerov algorithm.

Large transition moments for 86Sr allow us to experimentally characterize about 80 tran-

sitions for this isotope, extending to detunings as large as -1400 GHz (Fig. 2). This allows us

to clearly identify minima in the transition moment at

494

sponding to Condon radii of 62.6

0.2 a0 and 43 a0 respectively. To precisely determine the

position of the minimum at

494 GHz, we calculated a set of potential curves with diﬀerent

±

node positions by varying the position of the repulsive inner-wall. Using these curves we

performed a least-squares ﬁt to the data shown in the inset of Fig. 2. Quoted uncertainties

are one standard deviation. An overall amplitude factor was also varied but the best values

were always well within the experimental uncertainties discussed above. The determined

position of the node was independent of the value of the ground state C6 coeﬃcient used.

It also did not change signiﬁcantly if only data from -600 to -400 GHz was ﬁt.

The Sr ground state potential determined from the node position and the ground state

C6 coeﬃcient accurately describe the collisional properties of the system. This allows us

to determine the s-wave scattering length a86 from the calculated zero-energy continuum

wave function. However, we must carefully address the uncertainty in a86 arising from

uncertainty in C6. The best values in the literature are a semiempirical method yielding

C6 = 3250 a.u.
although a reevaluation of [35] inputting a more recent value of the 5s5p 1P1 lifetime [24]

[36], and a relativistic many-body calculation of C6 = 3170 a.u.

[35],

predicts C6 = 3103(7) a.u.

[37]. If we take the latter value, and a minimum at

370 a0. (a86 would diverge for a minimum position of

482 GHz.)

−

This large scattering length indicates a bound level in the ground state potential very near

threshold, which implies that a86 is also very sensitive to C6. For C6 = 3170 a.u. and
C6 = 3240 a.u. we calculate a86 = 940+279

90 a0 respectively. The spread

170 a0 and a86 = 700+140

−

−

in C6 values makes it diﬃcult to quote a rigorous statistical best value and uncertainty

for a86. Taking the extremes of the values found above, including spread in C6 and one-

standard-deviation variation in node position, we ﬁnd 610 a0 < a86 < 2300 a0.

PAS transitions in 88Sr are signiﬁcantly weaker than in 86Sr, and only 50 transitions were

characterized, extending to binding energies of -174 GHz (Fig. 3). We lack the sensitivity

required to observe transitions to the red of the ﬁrst minimum in the transition amplitude

and thus cannot independently determine its position with high accuracy. However, the

potential found using 86Sr should also determine the wavefunctions for 88Sr. Because of the

heavy mass of strontium, eﬀects due to the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approx-

imation should be negligible as is the case for rubidium [39]. Predicted photoassociation

rates agree with measurements within experimental uncertainties (Fig. 3), and we calculate

a88 = 10

3 a0 and a wave-function node at 76

0.4 a0 for C6 = 3103 a.u. For C6 = 3240

a.u., a88 = 2

3 a0. This yields

1 a0 < a88 < 13 a0.

In conclusion, we determined the scattering lengths of 86Sr and 88Sr from PAS spectra.

Our analysis uses full quantum calculations and is not based on semi-classical arguments

[24, 40] that can be invalid if the scattering length becomes divergent (as in 86Sr), small (as

in 88Sr), or negative. The large positive value for 86Sr is very promising for the realization

of a BEC through evaporative cooling in an optical trap. Such a condensate would have

the advantage that losses due to inelastic processes would be minimal since there is no

hyperﬁne interaction and spin-exhange collisions would not take place. The lifetime of a

86Sr condensate would be inﬂuenced mostly by three-body recombination. BEC of 88Sr will

be a signiﬁcant challenge [18] because of the small scattering length, but it may allow studies

of a very weakly interacting quantum gas with behavior similar to a hydrogen condensate

[41].

Exponential Basis in Two-Sided Variational Estimates of
Energy for Three-Body Systems

A.G.Donchev, N.N.Kolesnikov, V.I.Tarasov

Abstract

By the use of the variational method with exponential trial functions the upper and
lower bounds of energy are calculated for a number of non-relativistic three-body Coulomb
and nuclear systems. The formulas for calculation of upper and lower bounds for expo-
nential basis are given, the lower bounds for great part of systems were calculated for
the ﬁrst time. By comparison of calculations for diﬀerent bases the eﬃciency of exponen-
tial trial functions and their universality in respect to masses of particles and interaction
are demonstrated. The advantage of exponential basis manifests mostly evident for the
systems with comparable masses, though its use in one-center and two-center problems
is justiﬁed too. For eﬀective solution of two-center problem a carcass modiﬁcation of
the trial function is proposed. The stability of various three-particle Coulomb systems is
analyzed.

1 Introduction

Among existing methods of calculation of non-relativistic bounded systems the variational
method seems to be the most universal one as it is applied equally well for the solution of
atomic and nuclear problems.
It is essential that the variational method allows to ﬁnd not
only the upper (EU ) but also the lower (EL) estimates of the energy. As to potentiality of the
method, there are many examples of highly accurate calculations of three- and more-particle
systems [1]-[21]. For instance in the three-body Coulomb problem the precision is amounted up
to a score of decimal places. Of course in real physical systems the relativistic and other eﬀects
lead to corrections in the energy already in 5–7-th decimal place and therefore, in practical use
a variational procedure which ensures a reasonable accuracy with least computational eﬀorts
may be acceptable.

Historically the ﬁrst variational expansion in a three-particle problem was suggested by
Hylleraas in perimetrical coordinates in the form of exponent function multiplied by a poly-
nomial with integer nonnegative powers. Later negative and fractional powers were added [1],
[2], besides Frankowski and Pekeris [3] introduced logarithmic terms. In the next this basis is
referred as ’polynomial’ one.

Another possibility is to use a purely exponential basis.

It ensures a good ﬂexibility of
the variational expansion due to the presence of many scale nonlinear parameters. Whereas
the Hylleraas basis is practically oriented on solution of uni-center Coulomb problems the
exponential basis is good for systems with any masses of particles and types of their interaction
[4]. Besides, the calculations with exponential basis are more simple and uniform whereas
for polynomial basis they became more and more complicated as number of terms increases,
especially if the logarithmic terms are included.

Instead of exponents another non-polynomial functions, gaussians, can be used. They are
not less than exponents ﬁtted for the systems with any masses of particles, moreover they are
applicable to systems with arbitrary number of particles. For this basis all the formulas needed
for calculation of both the upper and lower bounds are given in paper [5], and diﬀerent 3-, 4-,
and 5-particle systems were calculated there. For the upper bound a generalization is given in
article [6] for arbitrary orbital moments. Nevertheless, our analysis have shown that at least
for three-body variational calculations with not very high number of parameters the precision
for gaussian basis is lower than for exponential one.

Our principal goal was not the striving for improvement of existing super-high precision
calculations but the analysis of eﬃciency of exponential and partly gaussian trial functions
for evaluation of the upper and lower variational bounds. For this purpose the Coulomb and
nuclear systems of particles with diﬀerent masses and types of interaction are considered and
the results of calculations are compared with those published in literature.

To facilitate such a comparison we will characterize the accuracy of calculations of EU and

EL by the values:

which determine the number of correct decimal places of EU and EL respectively, E0 being the
exact value of the energy.

The universality of exponential basis in respect to masses of particles allows us to analyze

the problem of stability of diﬀerent Coulomb three-particle systems.

2 Method of calculation

In three-particle problem it is convenient to use interparticle distances as coordinates together
with the Euler angles describing the orientation of the triangle formed by the particles.
In
the case of central interaction the wave function of the ground state (and exited state with
zero orbital momentum) depends only on interparticle distances, therefore the function can be
written as:

A calculation of matrix elements for the potential energy reduces to calculation of the

A calculation of lower variational estimate requires additional evaluations of matrix elements

Evidently, the diﬃculties arise mostly at optimization of the non-linear parameters. The
possibilities of the deterministic procedures are soon exhausted as the number of terms in
expansion (3) increases. Therefore, a specially designed procedure of global stochastic searching
was used. Brieﬂy it is the following: at each Monte-Carlo probe a random point is chosen in
3N-dimensional space of non-linear parameters according to previously accepted distribution
function. Then the coordinatewise optimization is carried on, at ﬁrst the stochastic one and
then the deterministic one. At this stage the best points are selected for subsequent detailed
optimization. Mentioned above distribution function is found by a procedure similar to that
described in [7].

3 Eﬃciency of calculations for various systems

To understand better what are the possibilities of exponential basis and described above opti-
mization procedure in calculations of systems with diﬀerent masses of particles and interactions
a number of Coulomb and nuclear systems were considered. Among them: He atom, hydrogen
ion H−, positronium ion Ps− (e+e−e−), meso-systems αµ−e−, pµ+e−, ppµ−, µ+µ+e−, µ+e−e−,
two-center Coulomb systems ppe−, dde−, tte−, as well as nuclei 3H and 3

ΛH.

The composition of the majority of considered Coulomb systems with the particles of unit
charge can be presented as X ±Y ∓Y ∓, the identical particles being denoted as Y . The binding
energies decrease together with the values of masses but the accuracy of calculation depends
only on the ratio of masses. For these systems the upper and lower bounds were calculated with
N = 30 in expansion (3), corresponding values δU and δL were plotted in Fig. 1 as the functions
of mass ratio, ξY X = mY /mX. In calculations of the lower bound the non-linear parameters
were accepted to be equal to these found for the upper bound.

As expected, the increase of ratio ξY X leads to the decrease of values δU and δL due to arising
diﬃculties in description of motion of heavy particles. Nevertheless even at the approach to
the two-center limit (ξY X ≫
1) the accuracy of calculations remains still satisfactory. For
comparison, in Fig.1 the results of most detailed calculations with polynomial basis [8] are
presented too. It is seen that the accuracy of calculations with polynomial basis [8] becomes
bad for ξY X > 0.1 in spite of large values of N. This comparison shows that the exponential
basis is applicable for a wider range of values of ξY X than the polynomial basis.

Note that in the case of Gaussian basis δU and δL decrease even more slowly than for

exponential basis (see Fig.1) though the latter provides generally higher precision.

The exponential basis can be used as well in the case of nuclear systems, even inconvenient
for calculation (weakly bounded systems, short-range attractive potentials with strong repulsion
at small distances between particles, that can be identical or not identical). As a particularly
’inconvenient’ system hypertritium, 3
ΛH (consisting of npΛ), was chosen. For comparison a
more ’convenient’ three-nucleon system, 3H, was considered. In these calculations two types
of model nuclear NN-potentials were used, (i) purely attractive potential NN
1 and (ii)
attractive potential with a soft core NN

The convergence of the upper and lower estimates for exponential basis is illustrated in
Table 1 and in Fig. 2 for various Coulomb and nuclear systems. As seen from Fig. 2 the
dependence of δU and δL on the lg N is close to the linear one.
In accordance with Fig. 1
the accuracy decreases as the system approaches to the adiabatic limit, and in parallel the
convergence of variational estimates deteriorates (it is characterized by the slope of curves in
Fig. 2). Note that the precision of calculations for considered nuclear systems is generally
similar or even better than for Coulomb systems.

Besides, in Fig. 2 some results of calculations with the Gaussian basis are shown (dotted

4 Comparison of results for diﬀerent bases

Comparison of eﬃciency of diﬀerent variational expansions is convenient to carry out on stan-
dard systems calculated by many authors. Such systems are ∞He and ∞H− considered in
[1]-[3],[5],[7]-[16]. In Fig. 3 the values of δU and δL, are plotted for these papers where the most
detailed calculations of atom ∞He were carried out, the results of our calculations are presented
there too. Similarly, in Fig. 4 δU and δL are presented for hydrogen ion ∞H−.

It is necessary to emphasize that both cases are examples of one-center systems. Therefore,
this is a reason to expect that the expansions especially designed for one-center problems
will gain the advantage. This is generally conﬁrmed by our analysis. Up to present the most
accurate many-parameters calculations of ∞He were carried out using polynomial or polynomial-
logarithmic bases. As it is seen from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 the convergence of the variational
expansions for these bases is generally better than for exponential or gaussian bases.

On the other hand, up to δU ≈

12 the use of exponential basis is justiﬁed as it assures the
same precision at lower number of terms (see Fig.3 and 4). Note that the over-high precision
in non-relativistic calculations without taking into account relativistic and other corrections
(that appears far before δ
12) have no physical meaning, though they are interesting from
≈
computational point of view.

−

As to the lower bound calculations they are rare in literature and we estimate the number
of N up to which the calculations of EL with exponential basis are justiﬁed (in the same sense
as for EU ) as 100

200.

Another limiting case is the adiabatic one (i.e. a two-center system with two heavy particles).
In this case the use of polynomial basis leads to unsatisfactory results, and the exponential
basis is evidently preferable (see Fig. 1). Moreover, the use of complex scale parameters in
exponential basis increases signiﬁcantly the accuracy of calculations [22]. The most accurate
calculations of two-center systems were carried out in the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer
approach [23] or its modiﬁcations [24], [25]. In particular, in paper [25] the energy of the system

calculation of [22] with exponential functions (note by the way that the number of basis terms
in [22] was less than in [25]).

For functions (6) all the integrals needed for calculations of the upper variational bound are
expressed in the closed form in terms of conventional functions. For instance, the basic integral

The calculations of the ground state of the system ppe− with this modiﬁed basis lead to
signiﬁcantly better results than with purely exponential or gaussian bases. In particular, in our

5

calculations it has been shown that even a single function (6) provides a better precision than
50 exponents or gaussians. Moreover, the basis (6) is more ﬂexible than the exponential basis
with complex parameters used in [22]. For instance, the result of calculations with N = 20
for ppe− turns out to be better than that of paper [22] with 200 complex exponents (1400
variational parameters) and better than calculations with 300 functions for systems µ+µ+e−,
dde− and tte−.

In addition to the preceding discussion of two limiting cases (one- and two-center problem)
it is necessary to indicate that there exists a large region of values of ξY X between 10−2 and
102 where the exponential basis is beyond compare. Note that this is the region where the
great part of known three-particle Coulomb systems is located. Thus, apart from gaussians,
the exponential basis seems to be the most universal one in comparison with other approaches,
applicable equally well to Coulomb and nuclear three-particle systems.

5 Stability of Coulomb Systems

All considered above Coulomb systems except two (αe−e− and αµ−e−) had summary charge
1 and consisted of three single-charged particles from which two are identical. All systems of
±
such type are stable in respect to separation of one of the particles. However this is not the
case for other type of three particle Coulomb systems. For analysis of stability of Coulomb
systems and for calculation of their energy it is natural to use the variational procedure with
exponential basis as it is most universal in respect to masses of particles (see also [27]).

±

In general case the structure of a Coulomb system of three single-charged particles with total
mZ. The stability of the system
charge
depends on two ratios of masses, ξY X = mY /mX and ξZX = mZ/mX. A boundary delimiting
the regions of stable and unstable systems is determined from the condition of coincidence
of the energy of the three-particle system with that of the two-particle system X ±Z ∓. The
corresponding equation determining the interdependence between ξY X and ξZX can be written
as:

f (ξY X, ξZX)

E(X ±Y ∓Z ∓)

≡

E(X ±Z ∓) −

1 = 0

(8)

The solution of this equation is presented in Fig. 5 by the curve A. It is seen that not only
systems with two identical particles are stable but also two-center systems (two heavy particles
with identical charges plus light particle with opposite charge). In contrast, a system containing
two heavy particles of opposite charges are unstable. An exception can occur if all three particles
have nearly equal masses. This takes place for instance for exotic systems p+p−Σ± (ξY X = 1,
ξZX = 1.2749), µ+µ−π± (ξY Z = 1, ξZX = 1.3213) and π+π−µ± (ξY X = 0.7568, ξZX = 1) for
which f = 0.008745, 0.006069 and 0.002354, respectively. Of course, a three-particle system
which is stable with respect to emission of one of the constituent particles can be unstable
in the excited state. This problem was considered in [4] for symmetric (XY Y ) systems with
mY /mX ≪
For the case of systems of the type X +mY +mZ −m containing multiple-charged particles the
situation is quit similar to the case of single-charged particles considered above. Among three-
body systems containing single and double charged particles the systems of the type X ++Y −Z +
and X ++Y −Z ++ are unstable at any ratio of their masses, whereas the systems X ++Y −Z − are
always stable. As to the systems of the type X ++Y −−Z + they can be stable only for restricted
values of ratios of their masses. The corresponding boundary is shown in the same Fig. 5,
curve B.

B Model Nuclear potentials

Parameters of used nuclear model potentials (4) and (5) are given in Table 4.

In calculations of hypertritium NN-potentials NN-1 and NN-2 were used. The radial
parameter of purely attractive potential NN-1 was chosen corresponding to one-pion exchange
whereas for NN-2 potential the values of Rr and Ra were adopted from paper [28]. The
depth parameters for potentials NN-1 and NN-2 were matched to correct deuteron energy,
additional experimental data in ﬁtting of parameters for NN-2 potential were deuteron radius
and phases of S-wave triplet np-scattering up to energy 300 MeV. In calculations of tritium 3H
the potential NN-3 was used with the same radial parameter as for potential NN-1, whereas
depth parameters was chosen to describe the correct tritium binding energy in calculations with
N = 100 in expansion (3).

The radius of ΛN-potential was adopted from paper [29] while the depth parameter provided

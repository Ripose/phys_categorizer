We report on cooling of an atomic cesium gas closely above an evanescent-wave atom mirror. Our
ﬁrst evaporation experiments show a temperature reduction from 10 µK down to 300 nK along with
a gain in phase-space density of almost two orders of magnitude. In a series of measurements of
heating and spin depolarization an incoherent background of resonant photons in the evanescent-
wave diode laser light was found to be the limiting factor at this stage.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Optical dipole traps based on far-detuned laser light
have become very popular as versatile tools for experi-
ments on ultracold atomic gases in an almost dissipation-
free environment [1].
In our experiments, we use the
gravito-optical surface trap (GOST) [2] to produce an
ultracold sample of cesium atoms on an evanescent-
wave atom mirror with the prospect to study a two-
dimensional atomic gas at high phase-space densities.

Atomic cesium is a candidate of particular interest be-
cause of its resonant scattering properties. In the lowest
Zeeman-substate, a low-ﬁeld Feshbach resonance [3] fa-
cilitates convenient magnetic tuning of the s-wave scat-
tering length from zero to very large positive or negative
values. For low-dimensional atomic systems, a scatter-
ing length exceeding the extension of the ground-state
wavefunction in one or more dimensions constitutes an
intriguing system [4, 5].

Here, after summarizing the basic properties of the
trap (Sec.II), we report our ﬁrst experiments demonstrat-
ing evaporative cooling of atoms in the GOST (Sec.III).
This important step to attain a two-dimensional gas at
high phase-space densities is achieved by ramping down
the optical trapping potentials. The current limita-
tions imposed by heating in the GOST are investigated
(Sec.IV), and the prospects of future experiments are dis-
cussed (Sec.V).

II. GRAVITO-OPTICAL SURFACE TRAP

A schematic overview of the geometry of the trap is
given in ﬁgure 1. The GOST is an “optical mug”, whose
bottom consists of an evanescent-wave (EW) atom mirror
generated by total internal reﬂection of a blue-detuned
laser beam from the surface of a prism, while the walls
are formed by an intense hollow beam (HB) which passes
vertically through the prism surface.

The steep exponential decay of the EW intensity along
the vertical direction and the sharp focussing of the hol-
low beam lead to large intensity gradients and thus in
combination with the blue detuning of both light ﬁelds
to a strong repulsive dipole force. We exploit this fact

to eﬃciently keep the atoms in the dark inner region of
the trap where the unwanted eﬀect of heating through
scattering of trapping light photons is suppressed. In ad-
dition to that, the concept also features a large trapping
volume which allows for a transfer of a large number of
atoms into the GOST. Due to the accurate focussing of
the hollow laser beam into a ring-shaped intensity pro-
ﬁle [7], the shape of the potential is box-like along the
horizontal directions whereas the combination of gravity
and the repulsive wall of the EW leads to a wedge-shaped
potential vertically.

The experimental constituents of the GOST are the
EW diode laser (SDL-5712-H1, distributed Bragg reﬂec-
tor), a titanium:sapphire laser to create the hollow beam
and an additional diode laser to provide the light for the
repumping beam. The EW laser is reﬂected from the
prism surface at an angle of θ = 45.6◦ (2◦ above the
critical angle), has a power of 45 mW, a 1/e2-radius of
540 µm and initially a detuning of δew/2π = 3 GHz with
respect to the D2-line. This leads to a 1/e2-decay length
500 nm and a repulsive optical potential barrier
of Λ
with a height of
1 mK. This is further reduced to about
half of this value by the attractive van-der-Waals inter-
action between the atoms and the dielectric surface [6].

The hollow beam is generated using an axicon optics
[7] to create a ring-shaped focus of an inner and outer
1/e-radius of rHB = 260 µm and rHB + ∆rHB = 290 µm,
respectively. It has a power of 350 mW and its detuning
is in the range between
2 nm. The HB
provides a potential barrier on the order of 100 µK height.
The weak repumping beam needed for the optical Sisy-
F ′ = 4
phus cooling [8] is resonant with the F = 4
hyperﬁne transition of the D2-line and has an intensity
on the order of 1 µW/cm2. It is shone on the trapping
region from above.

III. EVAPORATIVE COOLING

The GOST oﬀers favorable conditions to implement
forced evaporative cooling.
In contrast to red-detuned
dipole traps used for evaporation experiments [12, 13],
the spatial compression of the cold sample essentially
results from gravity and is thus not aﬀected when the
optical potentials are ramped down. Moreover, many
more atoms are initially loaded into the GOST as com-
pared to typical red-detuned traps. Here we describe our
ﬁrst experiments demonstrating the feasibility of eﬃcient
evaporation in the GOST.

−

The trap is operated at a HB detuning of

1 nm. With
an EW detuning intitially set to a few GHz, Sisyphus
cooling provides N = 107 atoms at a temperature of
1011 cm−3
T = 10 µK, and a peak density of n0 = 6
[9]. For the unpolarized sample in the seven-fold degen-
erate F = 3 ground state this corresponds to a peak
10−5 where
phase-space density of D = n0λ3
λdB = h/√2πmkBT is the thermal de-Broglie wave-
length. Elastic collisions take place at a rate on the or-
der of 50 s−1 and, considering the resonant scattering of
cesium [10, 11], lead to a thermalization time of about
200 ms.

To implement forced evaporation we lower the EW po-
tential by ramping up the EW detuning. This simultane-
ously reduces heating due to photon scattering and sup-
presses loss through inelastic collisions in the presence of
blue-detuned light [9]. Within 4.5 seconds the EW de-
tuning is increased exponentially from initially 7 GHz up
to 250 GHz. This is accomplished by rapid mode-hop free
temperature tuning of the EW diode laser. In the last
2.5 seconds of the evaporation ramp the intensity of the
hollow beam is reduced from 350 mW to 11 mW in order
to reduce possible heating by residual light in the dark
center of the hollow beam. The contribution of the HB
potential ramp to the evaporation remains very small.

The experimental results are shown in ﬁgure 2. About
1 s after starting the exponential ramp, the temperature
begins to drop [ﬁlled squares in (a)]. At the end of the

An obvious problem in this evaporation scheme is that,
for the applied exponential ramp, it takes about one sec-
ond until the EW potential barrier becomes low enough
to start the evaporation. Up to this point already about
50% of the particles are lost, presumably by the colli-
sional mechanism investigated in reference [9]. After the
corresponding initial loss of phase-space density the later

evaporation then leads to a gain of almost two orders
of magnitude. This already shows that the potential of
evaporative cooling in the GOST is much larger than we
could demonstrate in these ﬁrst experiments.

IV. HEATING

In order to understand the limitations of the evapo-
ration, we have investigated heating in the GOST. To
get quantitative results a measurement scheme has to be
applied in which the average energy per atom is much
smaller than the potential barriers of the trap. That way
one can exclude any eﬀects of evaporation which oth-
erwise would inﬂuence the measurement. Lowering its
power by a factor of eight to 40 mW during the ﬁrst four
seconds after the transfer leads to a strong horizontal
energy selection in the sample and thus cooled the re-
105 atoms down to about 3 µK. To measure
maining 5
heating without any signiﬁcant energy selection the HB
power is then switched back to its original value satisfy-
10kBT .
ing the condition Uhb ≥
To determine the heating rate, temperature measure-
ments are performed at various times after the HB power
is restored. During this stage the EW detuning is con-
stantly kept at δew/2π = 20 GHz as a compromise to
prevent any signiﬁcant optical cooling eﬀects while still
keeping the EW potential high enough for evaporation
not to occur. Figure 3 shows a typical temperature evo-
lution measurement and the linear ﬁt curve which yields
a heating rate of

700 nK/s.

ear ﬁt yields heating rates of 680±50 nK/s and 240±50 nK/s.

To calculate the expected heating rate, the mean pho-
ton scattering rate of an atom bouncing on an EW mirror
has to be multiplied with the temperature increase asso-
ciated with one scattering event. For a two-level atom
the mean scattering rate is given by [1]

1.2 s−1 under our experimental conditions. In
yielding
the geometry of the GOST one scattered photon leads to
2
80 nK [1]. In combi-
a heating of (2/5)¯h
nation with the above scattering rate this would lead to
a heating rate of about 100 nK/s. However, in the case
of cesium atoms with their hyperﬁne splitting and the
repumping laser applied to keep the atoms in the F = 3
state, heating by photon scattering is about twice this
value, so that we can expect a heating rate of
200 nK/s.
This falls short of the experimental result by about a fac-
tor of three.

∼

In order to investigate the possibility that a back-
ground of resonant photons in the EW light causes this
discrepancy between calculation and measurement, we
have used a cesium vapor cell heated to 50 ◦C to ﬁlter
resonant light out of the EW beam. The open circles
in ﬁgure 3 indicate the resulting temperature evolution
with a slope of 240 nK/s, which is now indeed consistent
with the expected heating rate. This strongly supports
our assumption that the problem of heating is mainly
due to an incoherent background of resonant photons.
In contrast to the case without a ﬁltering cell, we now
also ﬁnd the residual heating rate to strongly depend on
HB and EW detunings. By tuning the evanescent wave
to 40 GHz and the hollow beam to 1 nm heating rates as
low as 130 nK/s were observed.

To further investigate the consequences of photon scat-
tering, we removed the ﬁltering cesium cell and measured
the depolarization of the ground-state hyperﬁne popula-
tion as a function of time. As long as the repumping
beam of the GOST is switched on essentially all atoms
remain in the F = 3 ground state. Without the repump-
ing beam the sample gradually depolarizes and atoms
are transferred into the F = 4 state due to spontaneous
Raman scattering.

To get information on the time constant of the depolar-
ization we use the same procedure as before to prepare
the sample at a temperature of 3 µK and then switch
oﬀ the repumping beam. After various time intervals a
F ′ = 5
30 ms lasting light pulse of resonant F = 4
light illuminates the sample and pushes all atoms in the
F = 4 state out of the trap. Measuring the number of
remaining atoms then yields the population of the F = 3
ground state. Figure 4 shows the ground state popula-
tion normalized to the case without a resonant pulse as
a function of time.

→

A photon scattering rate of

5 s−1 can be deduced
from the depolarization rate of the ground-state hyper-
ﬁne population. With the repumper present this cor-
responds to a heating of about 800 nK/s. This again
supports our assumption that the observed heating can
essentially be attributed to photon scattering from a
very small, but detrimental fraction of resonant photons
present in the EW light.

∼

To investigate the origin of the resonant photons, we
measured the steady-state ground state population after
three seconds of depolarization time as a function of the
EW detuning δew. Figure 5 shows the striking result of

this experiment. The F = 3 state population exhibits a
resonance-like behavior and takes a value close to 100%
at an EW detuning of δew/2π = 27 GHz and vanishes
at δew/2π
36 GHz. We interpret this as the eﬀect
of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission of photons into non-
lasing side modes of the diode laser cavity (mode spacing
36 GHz). As the side mode is tuned in resonance with

the optical transition from the upper state this leads to
an eﬃcient repumping into the F = 3 ground state and
thus to a relative population of almost one whereas in the
opposite case of a resonance with the optical transition
from the F = 3 state is depleted by the resonant photons.

over 250 GHz, this leads to several successive coincidences
between side modes and the atomic transition and thus
repeatedly to strong heating. This behavior easily ex-
plains the limited eﬃciency of evaporation as reported in
the preceding section.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Our experiments demonstrate evaporative cooling in
the gravito-optical surface trap. A gain in phase-space
density of almost a factor of 100 was achieved by ramping
up the evanescent-wave detuning. The maximum phase-
space density obtained in these experiments was
10−4 at a temperature of about 300 nK.

As the limiting factor we have identiﬁed heating by
scattering of resonant photons contained in the diode-
laser light used for the evanescent wave. Even though
the lasing mode of the diode laser is detuned far enough,
ampliﬁed spontaneous emission in non-lasing side modes
lead to signiﬁcant heating. An easy remedy to this prob-
lem is the use of a cesium absorption cell to ﬁlter out
these photons. First experiments have indeed shown a
substantial reduction of heating with such a cell.

In other experiments not reported here we have also
found strong indications that at low EW potentials the
lifetime of the trapped sample is severely limited by sur-
face defects of our prism. The performance of the GOST
then strongly depends on the exact position on the prism
surface. Therefore we are now preparing an new set-up
featuring a superpolished high-quality fused-silica prism.
At the lowest temperatures that we have obtained the
atoms bounce on the prism surface with a mean height as
low as
2 µm. In this case, the mean quantum number
of the vertical motion is already quite small (about ﬁve
to ten). Thus the cold surface gas is not far from con-
ditions under which the vertical motion will freeze out
and the system will acquire two-dimensional character.
With optimized evaporative cooling, the above improve-
ments, and the further option to enhance the anisotropic
character of the trap by using a second evanescent wave
[14], a two-dimensional quantum gas in the GOST with
tunable interactions seems to be in experimental reach.

a severe problem for evaporation by ramping up the EW

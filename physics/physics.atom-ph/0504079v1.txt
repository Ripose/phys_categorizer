We have realized a high-resolution time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer combined with a magneto-
optical trap. The spectrometer enables excellent optical access to the trapped atomic cloud using
properly devised acceleration and deﬂection electrodes. The ions are extracted along a laser axis and
deﬂected onto an oﬀ axis detector. The setup is applied to detect atoms and molecules photoassoci-
ated from ultracold atoms. The detection is based on resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization.
The versatile setup can easily be implemented in more complex experiments with ultracold atomic
and molecular gases. Mass resolution up to m/∆mrms = 1000 at the mass of 133Cs is achieved.

I.

INTRODUCTION

[2]

Applying ultracold atoms as targets for collision exper-
iments with electrons, atoms, ions or photons requires
sensitive ion detectors which ideally also exhibit good
mass resolution [1]. As an important example, in the
study of ultracold ground state molecules formed from
ultracold atoms an eﬃcient and state-selective molecule
detection scheme is based on resonance-enhanced multi-
in combination with
photon ionization (REMPI)
time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometers
employed to date in experiments with ultracold gases
used simple electric ﬁeld geometries for the extraction
and detection of the ions. They oﬀer good optical access
at the expense of poor mass resolution (m/∆m ≃ 10),
which nevertheless is suﬃcient for separating homonu-
clear dimers [2, 3, 4] and in some cases also heteronuclear
dimers from their atomic constituents [5, 6, 7]. For pho-
toassociation experiments involving light atoms, e.g. Li,
or for the separation of isotopomers, better mass resolu-
tion is required.

Here we present an advanced time-of-ﬂight mass spec-
trometer with high resolution and good optical access
for the detection of ions formed by ionization of trapped,
ultracold atoms. High mass resolution is achieved by
time focussing of the ions following a Wiley-McLaren
scheme [8]. The ﬁeld plates for accelerating the ions and
the detector allow for optimal optical access to the region
of the magneto-optical trap (MOT) as described in more
detail below. This spectrometer opens possibilities for a
whole variety of new experiments with ultracold atoms
and molecules. It even becomes possible to discriminate
between diﬀerent isotopes e.g., in a charge-transfer exper-
iment, or to distinguish between isotopomers of bialkali
dimers in a photoassociation experiment, e.g., 39K85Rb

and 39K87Rb. This article is organized as follows.
In
Sec. II the design of the time-of-ﬂight spectrometer is pre-
sented. The experimental characterization is described in
Sec. III. A discussion is given in Sec. IV.

II. DESIGN OF THE MASS SPECTROMETER

A time-of-ﬂight (TOF) mass spectrometer oﬀers sev-
eral advantages in experiments with cold atoms and
molecules. With this kind of spectrometer it is possible
to record the whole mass spectrum at once, which is not
the case for quadrupole or magnetic mass ﬁlters. This al-
lows to monitor the development of the ratio of atoms to
molecules, which can be helpful in optimizing production
mechanisms for molecules. In addition it is insensitive to
magnetic ﬁelds, which are needed to operate magneto-
optical traps or magnetic traps. As demonstrated by
Wiley and McLaren [8] and employed in numerous ex-
periments, e.g., with gas cells or molecular beams, the
resolution of a time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer can be
signiﬁcantly improved by using a two step acceleration
of the ions in electric ﬁelds of diﬀerent strength created
between three parallel ﬁeld plates. By adjusting the ra-
tio between the two ﬁeld strengths it is possible to time
focus an ion cloud onto an ion detector.

As shown in Fig. 1 the spectrometer consists of two
parts: an acceleration and a detection region. The ac-
celeration is done by three horizontal ﬁeld plates built
around the magneto-optical trap from which the ions are
produced. The stainless steel ﬁeld plates are 2 mm thick,
have a diameter of 80 mm, with a central hole of 30 mm
diameter. No grids are mounted across the holes. The
lower and the middle plate are separated by 40 mm and
centered vertically around the MOT. The upper electrode
is separated from the middle one by 20 mm. A voltage
UL = 300 V is applied to the lower plate and typically
UM = 200 V to the middle plate. The upper plate is
grounded. This accelerates the ions upwards through the

Time of flight [µs](cid:13)

FIG. 1: Drawing of the mass spectrometer (not to scale).
The ions are produced from a magneto-optical trap between
the lower two plates and accelerated upwards. After drifting
through a ﬁeld free region of 30 cm they are deﬂected onto a
microchannel plate detector. The setup allows optical access
in the whole horizontal plane and along the vertical axis.

holes into the drift region.

After passing the ﬁeld free drift region of 30 cm length,
the ions arrive at the detection part of the spectrometer.
This part is composed of three deﬂection electrodes and a
microchannel plate (MCP) detector attached on a single
CF63 ﬂange. The detector is mounted oﬀ the vertical axis
to allow for optical access along this axis. This design
leaves full optical access in the entire horizontal plane, in
planes tilted up to 30◦ from the horizontal and along the
vertical axis.

In order to obtain a good mass resolution it is essential
to apply homogenous deﬂection ﬁelds perpendicular to
the ﬂight direction of the ions. This is achieved using
grounded electrodes opposite and around the deﬂector
as shown in Fig. 1. The voltage applied to the deﬂector
is typically -1.2 kV. A grounded grid is placed in front of
the MCP to avoid background gas ions being pulled onto
the detector.

Simulations with SimIon [9] show that the inﬂuence
of the deﬂection on the resolution is negligible for ions
produced in a MOT, i.e., with negligible transverse mo-
menta.

As ion detector we use a matched pair of MCP plates
(Burle Industries) [10]. The front of the ﬁrst plate is held
at a potential of -2.1 kV, the back of the second plate at
-100 V. The produced electrons hit an anode plate behind
the MCP connected to ground through a 100 kΩ resistor.
AC signals from the anode are coupled out through a
capacitance of 1 nF and referenced with 50 Ω to ground.
A single ion arriving at the MCP produces a pulse of
about 7 ns width at an amplitude of about 3 mV. The
deﬂection electrode is mounted electrically isolated from
the grounded plates using PEEK, which is a high quality

plastic and sustains bakeout temperatures over 200◦C
without mechanical distortion and outgassing.

III. CHARACTERIZATION

For the characterization of the mass spectrometer we
produced Cs+ ions from atoms in a MOT by photoion-
ization with a pulsed dye laser (Radiant Dyes, Narrows-
can, 7 ns pulse, 20 mJ/pulse, 20 Hz, operated at 716 nm).
The MOT is loaded from a Zeemann-slowed atomic beam
from a Cs oven. For these measurements, typically 107 Cs
atoms are trapped at a particle density of 1010 cm−3.
In addition Cs2 molecules are formed via photoassocia-
tion of the atoms using a cw Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent
MBR 110) and ionized through REMPI using the pulsed
dye laser [2]. Fig. 2 shows a typical measured time-of-
ﬂight spectrum for Cs+ and Cs+
2 . The atomic ions arrive
21.2 µs after the ionization laser pulse, the ﬂight time of
the molecular ions is about 1.4 times longer, as expected
from the square root of the mass ratio.

To optimize the time focussing of the ions on the de-
tector, we vary the ratio of the electric ﬁeld strengths by
applying a ﬁxed voltage of UL = +300 V on the lowest
ﬁeld plate, keeping the upper one on ground and vary-
ing the voltage UM applied to the middle plate. This
measurement was done with only very few ions produced
per pulse (< 15), to avoid interaction among the ions
through Coulomb repulsion and saturation eﬀects of the
MCP. Fig. 3 shows the rms peak width of the atomic
ion signal for the atomic ions as a function of UM . The
width is extracted from an average of 128 single TOF
traces. The signal depends strongly on the voltage UM
with a minimal rms peak width of about 10 ns at UM =
202 V. The peak width corresponds to a mass resolution
of
∆mrms = 1000. This is in good agreement with the
width of 15 ns obtained from the SimIon simulations. Fig.

FIG. 3: Time focusing of the ions on the detector by varying

to be controlled on the one percent level for having opti-
mal resolution.

Broadening of the signal due to Coulomb repulsion
among the ions on their way to the detector is negligible
for small ion numbers. However, it becomes the dom-
inant broadening process for larger ion numbers. The
inﬂuence of the Coulomb repulsion is investigated in two
distinct ways. First, the number of ions produced in the
extraction ﬁeld is varied in a controlled way, second, a
constant number of ions is produced in a ﬁeld free en-
vironment and a variable delay between production and
extraction of these ions is applied.

The number of ions, which is estimated from the peak
area of the MCP signal, is varied by changing the power
of the dye laser. The peak width increases with increasing
ion number as shown in Fig. 4, hence the mass resolution
decreases. The larger the ion number, the larger is the
space charge density which leads to a stronger repulsion
in the ionic cloud. Therefore the peak width on the de-
tector grows with the number of produced ions. Since the
ion number is varied by two orders of magnitude, special
care must be taken to prevent saturation of the MCP for
large ion numbers. Hence, we lowered the voltage ap-
plied to the MCP for larger ion intensities and used a
relative calibration in order to compare the MCP signals
at diﬀerent MCP voltages.

In a second measurement at a constant ion number, a
variable delay is inserted between the time of production
of the ions (time of dye laser pulse) and the begin of their
acceleration towards the detector. The voltages on the
lower and middle ﬁeld plates are switched with fast HV-
switches (Behlke Electronic) and delays of 0-100 µs are
generated with a delay generator (Berkeley Nucleonics
Corporation, Model 555 Pulse/Delay Generator). This
gives the ion cloud more time to expand under the inﬂu-
ence of the Coulomb force and leads to a broader tem-

bers.

poral distribution of the ions on the detector. Since the
temperature of the ions is only a few hundred µK ther-
mal energy can be neglected and the expansion is due
to the Coulomb interaction only. For small ion numbers
almost no eﬀect is visible for small delay times (upper
graph in Fig. 5). For delay times beyond 40 µs the sig-
nal becomes broader starting from less than 25 ns up to
almost 250 ns after 95 µs delay. One would expect the
peak area to be constant for a constant ion number. The
slight increase is due to a saturation of the MCP. For
large delays the ions hit a bigger area of the MCP and
hence saturation is reduced. For large ion numbers (lower
graph in Fig. 5 (b)) the peak width at zero delay is much
larger than for the small ion numbers because the ions
repel each other signiﬁcantly on their way to the detec-
tor. The insertion of a delay has only little inﬂuence on
the peak width, however, the total number of detected
ions decreases rapidly. Under these conditions the strong
Coulomb repulsion enlarges the cloud too much to map
all ions onto the detector any longer and some of them
hit the electrodes or the chamber walls.

IV. DISCUSSION

With the good resolution of m

∆m = 1000 it is possible
to distinguish between atomic Cs+ and molecular LiCs+
ions produced from a two-species MOT setup via pho-
toassociation. For large ion numbers, however, the mass
resolution is decreased due to Coulomb repulsion between
the ions during their ﬂight time. Therefore, one has to
adjust the ion intensity to optimize signal strength versus
mass resolution and suppress unwanted ions (e.g., atomic
cesium). In our case, this can either be done by push-
ing away the atoms with a resonant laser before ionizing
the molecules or by switching on the deﬂection electrode
after the atomic ions have passed through the deﬂector
region.

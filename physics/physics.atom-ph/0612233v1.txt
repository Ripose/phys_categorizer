The ac Stark eﬀect was used to induce resonant energy transfer between translationally cold
Rydberg atoms. The 85Rb Rydberg atoms were obtained by laser excitation of cold atoms from a
magneto-optical trap. Using two-photon microwave spectroscopy of the 49s1/2 − 50s1/2 transition,
the ﬁeld strength of a 28.5 GHz dressing ﬁeld was calibrated. When this dressing ﬁeld was set
at speciﬁc ﬁeld strengths, the two-atom dipole-dipole process 43d5/2 + 43d5/2 → 45p3/2 + 41f
was dramatically enhanced, due to induced degeneracy of the initial and ﬁnal states. A series
of observed resonant ﬁeld strengths correspond to diﬀerent magnetic sublevel possibilities for the
initial and ﬁnal states. These agree well with calculated resonance ﬁelds based on a perturbative
ac Stark shift formula. This method for enhancing interactions is complementary to dc electric-
ﬁeld-induced resonant energy transfer, but has more ﬂexibility due to the possibility of varying the
applied frequency.

The large transition dipole moments of Rydberg atoms
make them much more sensitive to electric ﬁelds than
less excited atoms. For example, the dc polarizabilities
of low-angular momentum Rydberg states scale like n7,
where n is the principal quantum number [1]. This high
sensitivity can be exploited for various means. For in-
stance, energy transfer between Rydberg atoms may of-
ten be tuned into resonance using dc electric ﬁelds [2].

Rydberg atoms are also sensitive to small oscillating
electric ﬁelds. For example, microwave dressing ﬁelds
may be used to modify the dc polarizabilities of Rydberg
states [3]. This could be used to reduce the inﬂuence
of electric ﬁeld inhomogeneities on the dephasing of a
Rydberg atom qubit.

The present work demonstrates the use of weak mi-
crowave dressing ﬁelds to tune electric dipole-dipole in-
teractions between Rydberg atoms into resonance, in a
case where this cannot be accomplished by dc ﬁelds. We
exploit the latitude to change both the amplitude and
frequency of the dressing ﬁelds to create interatomic in-
teractions which are much stronger than could otherwise
be achieved.

Our results may be understood in terms of the ac Stark
shifts of the relevant states. The ac Stark shift of a state
|φ>, in an electric ﬁeld oscillating at angular frequency
ω, with amplitude εz in the z direction, is given by (see,
for example, Ref. [4]):

∆Eφ =

ε2
z X
m6=φ

(Eφ − Em)|<φ|µz|m>|2
(Eφ − Em)2 − (~ω)2

(1)

where Em refers to the energy of state |m > and µz is
the electric dipole moment in the z direction. The mod-
iﬁcation of resonant energy transfer between Rydberg
atoms by microwave ﬁelds has been previously studied
in a strong ﬁeld regime, where the Floquet description
was more suitable [5, 6].

The ac Stark shifts of Rydberg states can be probed
using microwave spectroscopy. For our purposes, this

provides a useful check on the validity of Eq. 1, and
allows us to calibrate the applied ﬁeld strengths when
studying interatomic interactions. Our apparatus has
been described previously [7, 8]. A standard vapor cell
magneto-optical trap (MOT) acts as a source of cold
85Rb atoms. These are excited to 49s1/2 Rydberg states
using a 1 µs pulse of laser light. Before excitation, the
magnetic and electric ﬁelds are reduced to less than 0.02G
and 0.05 V/cm respectively. Approximately 3 µs after ex-
citation, a 28.5 GHz ac dressing ﬁeld is turned on. While
the dressing ﬁeld is on, a ≈ 33 GHz probe drives the
49s1/2 − 50s1/2 two-photon transition. The probe pulse
lasts 6 µs. The dressing ﬁeld is then switched oﬀ and
a selective ﬁeld ionization pulse [1] is applied to mea-
sure the 49s1/2 and 50s1/2 populations. By scanning the
probe frequency between laser shots and collecting the
resulting spectra, we can measure the diﬀerence in the
ac Stark shifts of the two states involved in the transi-
tion (see Fig. 1). As Eq. 1 indicates, the shifts should
scale linearly with applied dressing ﬁeld power. This is
veriﬁed in Fig. 1b.

As shown in Fig. 1, the linewidth of the transitions in-
crease as they shift. By varying the Rydberg density and
probe power, we have determined that this is not due to
interatomic interactions or power broadening. The ob-
served broadening is very sensitive to the alignment of
the horn that launches the dressing microwaves towards
the atoms. By varying the position of this horn, the
broadening can be made signiﬁcantly worse than shown
in Fig. 1. Thus, we believe that the broadening with
increasing power is due to spatial inhomogeneity of the
dressing ﬁelds over the cold atom sample (this is compli-
cated, due to the presence of reﬂections and low-Q res-
onances within the vacuum chamber). Minimizing this
inhomogeneity is a major technical challenge in using
dressing ﬁelds.

By evaluating the matrix elements in Eq. 1 using the
techniques of Zimmermann et al. [9], we can compute the

FIG. 1: (a) Observation of the two-photon 49s1/2 − 50s1/2
microwave transition for diﬀerent powers of a 28.5 GHz dress-
ing ﬁeld. The probe frequency shown on the horizontal

frequency dependence of the ac Stark shift. In particular,
as the denominator of Eq. 1 suggests, the shift direction
may be reversed by changing ω. Spectroscopy probes the
diﬀerential shift between the two levels involved, and this
may also be reversed. For example, we have observed
that the 49s1/2 − 50s1/2 transition is shifted to higher
frequency with a dressing ﬁeld of 37.45 GHz, and that
this shift is also proportional to dressing power. This
ability to change the direction of diﬀerential energy shifts
with the applied frequency is essential to what follows.

It is well-known that dc Stark shifts may be used to en-
hance the interactions between Rydberg atoms [1, 2]. For
example, consider the following resonant energy transfer
process in Rb, which may be driven by the dipole-dipole
interaction:

nd5/2 + nd5/2 → (n + 2)p3/2 + (n − 2)f5/2,7/2.

For n = 44 the energy of the ﬁnal state is approximately
60 MHz higher than that of the initial state (calculated
using the spectrosopic data of Ref.’s [10, 11]). How-
ever, as an electric ﬁeld is applied, the 42f states exhibit
strong, quadratic Stark shifts to lower energies. This

FIG. 2: DC electric-ﬁeld-induced resonant energy trans-
fer spectra, with atoms initially in the a) 44d5/2 and b)
43d5/2 states. Also shown are the calculated total energy
of several two atoms states, relative to the zero ﬁeld en-
ergy of nd5/2 + nd5/2, where n = 44 and 43. For the ini-
tial states nd5/2 + nd5/2 (dashed lines), we plot all mag-
netic sublevel possibilities for each of the two atoms involved
(mj = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2).
In the case of the ﬁnal states, we
consider the diﬀerent possibilities for the two atom ener-
gies depending on the magnetic sublevel of the (n + 2)p3/2
states (mj = 1/2, 3/2), and the (n − 2)f and (n − 2)k states
(mj = 1/2, ..., 7/2). The calculations follow the procedures of
Ref. [9] and use the spectroscopic data of Ref.’s [10] and [11].

tunes the process into resonance, as shown in Fig. 2a.
In particular, atoms are excited to nd5/2 Rydberg states
and allowed to interact in the presence of a weak dc ﬁeld.
By varying the dc electric ﬁeld between laser shots, and
detecting the (n+2)p population by selective ﬁeld ioniza-
tion, resonant energy transfer spectra may be obtained
(see Ref. [12] for more details). As Fig. 2 illustrates, at
n = 44 the resonance condition is turned on by a weak
electric ﬁeld, but for n = 43 it is tuned further out of res-
onance. In this case the initial state is higher in energy
than the ﬁnal state by ≈ 10 MHz.

Since dc ﬁelds cannot tune 43d5/2 + 43d5/2 → 45p3/2 +
41f5/2,7/2 into resonance, we consider using ac ﬁelds. In
particular, we expect that the ﬂexibility in the choice of
ω, which allows shift directions to be reversed, could be

FIG. 3: Calculated diﬀerence in the ac Stark shifts of the ﬁnal
and initial states of the process 43d5/2 + 43d5/2 → 45p3/2 +
41f5/2 (all in mj = 1/2) as a function of microwave frequency.
With no microwave ﬁeld, the ﬁnal state is lower in energy than
the initial state by 6.0MHz and 8.3MHz (for 41f5/2 and 41f7/2
respectively) [10, 11]. Therefore, frequencies where the shift
is positive in this ﬁgure (ie. 28.5 GHz) will push this process
closer to resonance.

beneﬁcial. To illustrate this, the diﬀerence in ac Stark
shifts between the ﬁnal and initial states have been com-
puted as a function of frequency using Eq 1. Figure 3
illustrates that over certain frequency ranges the ac ﬁeld
would shift the initial and ﬁnal states closer into reso-
nance – which could not be achieved with a dc electric
ﬁeld (see Fig. 2b).

To experimentally test this idea, we have looked for
the resonant energy transfer process: 43d5/2 + 43d5/2 →
45p3/2 + 41f5/2,7/2, in the presence of a 28.5 GHz mi-
crowave ﬁeld. The atoms are excited to 43d5/2 Ryd-
berg states (as discussed above), and the dressing ﬁeld is
turned on 3 µs after excitation. This ﬁeld is held on for
20 µs until shortly before selective ﬁeld ionization. This
is repeated, scanning the applied microwave power be-
tween shots. No deliberate dc electric ﬁeld is applied.
As Fig. 4 indicates, a signiﬁcant population transfer to
the 45p state is observed with the microwave ﬁeld ap-
plied. As with the dc case, a series of resonances are
observed. This is expected, due to the diﬀerent mag-
netic sublevel possibilities for the ﬁnal and initial states
(see below). When the microwave ﬁeld strength is ﬁxed
at a resonance position and the overall Rydberg density
of the sample is varied (by changing the excitation laser
power), the fraction transferred decreases with reduced
density. This conﬁrms that the observed resonances are
due to an interatomic process. The transferred fraction
grows linearly with density (for small transfer fractions,
where depletion of the initial states is not signiﬁcant).
The widths of the resonances also increase with density.
To calibrate the applied ﬁelds in Fig. 4, we observe
the single-photon transition 43d5/2 − 45p3/2 with a series
of dressing ﬁeld strengths. As with the 49s1/2 − 50s1/2
case, the shifts are observed to be linear in applied mi-
crowave power. However, this case is slightly more com-
plicated, due to the diﬀerent magnetic sublevels involved.

FIG. 4: Observed 45p signal as a fraction of total Ryd-
berg signal following a 23 µs waiting period after excitation
of 43d5/2 Rydberg atoms, with a 28.5 GHz ﬁeld of variable
strength present. The ﬁeld amplitude calibration is discussed
in the text. The vertical lines indicate calculated resonance
ﬁeld strengths for the diﬀerent magnetic sublevel possibil-
ities for the initial and ﬁnal states of 43d5/2 + 43d5/2 →
45p3/2 + 41f5/2,7/2 (see text for details).

By equating the experimentally observed shift of these
transitions with those based on the prediction of Eq. 1,
we can determine the factor relating ε2
z to the applied mi-
crowave power. This calibration can be compared with
the ﬁeld calibration obtained from the 49s1/2 − 50s1/2
line discussed at the beginning of this paper. It is essen-
tial that these calibrations are done at the same dressing
ﬁeld frequency, due to frequency dependent losses, reﬂec-
tions and low-Q resonances within the vacuum chamber.
These calibrations agree to within 20 %. Discrepencies
may be due to the distribution of the probe ﬁeld, which
will have a slightly diﬀerent spatial distribution over the
trapped atom cloud at these two diﬀerent frequencies.

Although the experiment is done with no deliberately
applied dc electric ﬁelds, they are diﬃcult to avoid, since
they vary from day to day. Therefore, the frequencies
of each of the 43d5/2 − 45p3/2 and 43d5/2 − 41f5/2,7/2
transitions are measured, with no dressing ﬁeld present.
These give the experimental diﬀerence in energies be-
tween the ﬁnal and initial states of Eq. 2 for the ﬁeld
conditions of the experiment. We ﬁnd that this “energy
defect”, δE ≈ −7.4 ± 0.1 MHz for the 41f5/2 case and
≈ −9.6 ± 0.1 MHz for the 41f7/2 case. These diﬀer from
the values of −6.0(5) MHz and −8.3(4) MHz obtained
from the constants of Ref.’s [10] and [11]. Although a
small electric ﬁeld explains some of this discrepency, the
shifts of the 43d5/2 − 45p3/2 and 43d5/2 − 41f5/2,7/2 lines
are not consistent with the same ﬁeld. In addition, the
ﬁeld required to explain the shift of the 43d5/2 − 45p3/2
line exceeds the uncertainty in the electric ﬁeld zero
(±0.05 V/cm), suggesting that a slight adjustment of the
spectroscopic constants may be necessary.

From the experimentally observed energy defects we
can calculate the resonance ﬁeld strengths for the diﬀer-
ent magnetic sublevel possibilities. The ac Stark shifts

for a state |φ> may be written as ∆Eφ = kφε2
z, where
kφ is computed using Eq. 1. For a process like Eq. 2
(|a> +|b> → |c> +|d>) the resonance ﬁelds may be com-
puted by rearrangement of: δE +[kc +kd −ka −kb]ε2
z = 0.

indicate all calculated resonance ﬁelds consistent with
∆mj = 0, ±1 for each atom. Although many of the res-
onances are unresolved, the general agreement is good,
and the highest ﬁeld resonances are in clear agreement
with the calculation.

Some caution is required in applying Eq. 1 to the
41f5/2,7/2 states, due to the small energy separation of
the two ﬁne structure components (2.3 MHz). The ﬁne
structure splittings of the other relevant states, 45p3/2,1/2
and 43d3/2,5/2, are signiﬁcantly larger. When the Stark
shifts become comparable to the splitting of the two ﬁne
structure components, Eq. 1 is not valid. This is en-
tirely analogous with the perturbative calculation of po-
larizabilities in the dc case. To examine this issue, a
Floquet calculation has been implemented (see, for ex-
ample, Ref. [13]). This calculation shows that for the
ﬁeld strengths at the resonance locations, the perturba-
tive calculation is accurate on the scale of Fig. 4.

The modiﬁcation of resonant energy transfer between
Rydberg atoms due to strong microwave ﬁelds has been
reported [5, 6].
In this case, the primary observation
was that an integer number of microwave photons can
either be given up or gained in resonant energy transfer to
account for the energy defect between the initial and ﬁnal
states. Thus, the exact frequency of the ac ﬁeld plays an
important role. The microwave power determines the
number of “sidebands” present (the number of photons
lost or gained in the collision). This can be accurately
described using Floquet theory [6] (although the ac Stark
eﬀect does play a minor, observable role). In the present

4

work – where the energy level shifts are perturbative – the
important tuning parameter is the microwave power. The
frequency is not as important – it should be set within a
range to give the desired shift the correct sign. However,
it should not be too close to any resonance, as this will
prevent the microwave ﬁelds from being turned on and
oﬀ adiabatically.

Rydberg atom interactions have recently received con-
siderable attention in the context of quantum information
processing with neutral atoms. For example, the dipole-
dipole interaction between Rydberg atoms has been pro-
posed as means of allowing clouds of cold atoms to store
qubits, using a process known as dipole blockade [14].
Lukin et al. [14] considered using long-range resonant
electric dipole interactions. However, initial experiments
in Rb have focused on non-resonant van der Waals in-
teractions [15, 16, 17]. Recently, local blockade has been
observed in Cs using resonant dipole-dipole interactions
between Rydberg atoms [18]. In Rb, several groups have
identiﬁed Eq. 2 as a strong resonant process [19, 20, 21].
As the experimental results of the present work indicate,
this process may be shifted into resonance by either dc
or ac electric ﬁelds (Fig.’s 2 and 4). This would enhance
the blockade eﬀect. Possible advantages of ac ﬁelds over
dc ﬁelds include the capacity to turn interactions on and
oﬀ very quickly (due to the modulation capabilities of
the source), and the ability to induce interactions at ar-
bitrary dc ﬁelds.

In summary, perturbative ac ﬁelds have been demon-
strated to enhance the interactions between Rydberg
atoms by making them resonant. The frequency depen-
dence of the ac Stark shift allows this to be accomplished
with more versatility than the dc Stark shift.

Optical Feshbach resonances of Alkaline-Earth atoms in a 1D or 2D optical lattice

(Dated: 21st February 2014)

Motivated by a recent experiment by Zelevinsky et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 203201], we present the theory
for photoassociation and optical Feshbach resonances of atoms conﬁned in a tight one-dimensional (1D) or
two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice. In the case of an alkaline-earth intercombination resonance, the narrow
natural width of the line makes it possible to observe clear manifestations of the dimensionality, as well as
some sensitivity to the scattering length of the atoms. Among possible applications, a 2D lattice may be used to
increase the spectroscopic resolution by about one order of magnitude. Furthermore, a 1D lattice induces a shift
which provides a new way of determining the strength of a resonance by spectroscopic measurements.

I.

INTRODUCTION

III, we apply the theory to the case of alkaline-earth species.
In section IV, we conclude on the possible effects and uses
of alkaline-earth photoassociation in optical lattices.

There is a growing experimental effort to study the proper-
ties of ultracold alkaline-earth vapours. One of the reasons is
that the narrow intercombination resonance of alkaline-earth
species (weakly coupling 1S0 and 3P1 states) can be used
to build optical atomic clocks which could be more accu-
rate that the current atomic standard of time [1, 2, 3]. The
Bose-condensation of Ytterbium [4], whose atomic structure
is close to alkaline-earth species, has also raised the hope
of condensing these species. To reach these goals, a good
knowledge, and possibly control, of alkaline-earth atomic in-
teractions are needed. Photoassociation, the process of asso-
ciating pairs of colliding atoms into excited bound states by
making them absorb a resonant photon, appears as the best
tool to characterize and control these interactions. Indeed,
photoassociation can be used as a spectroscopic tool to mea-
sure energy levels in excited molecular states [5, 6, 7] and
characterize ground-state atomic interactions [8]. It can also
be regarded as an optical Feshbach resonance [9], analogous
to magnetic Feshbach resonances in alkali systems, making
it possible to alter these interactions [10]. This is particularly
useful for alkaline-earth systems with no hyperﬁne structure,
where magnetic Feshbach resonance is not possible.

Photoassociation near the intercombination resonance is
characterized by narrow lines which are sensitive to effects
like recoil shifts (due to the momentum of the absorbed pho-
ton) and Doppler broadening. These effects can be elim-
inated by strongly conﬁning the atoms in the direction of
propagation of the photoassociation light. This has been
demonstrated by trapping the atoms in tight optical lattices
[3, 11, 12, 13]. The wave length of the lattice can be ad-
justed to its “magic” value [11], so that atoms in the ground
state and the excited state feel the same trapping potential.

In turn, it is known that strong conﬁnement may affect the
collisional properties of the atoms [14, 15]. We can there-
fore expect photoassociation to be different in an optical lat-
tice than it is in free space. The purpose of this paper is
to investigate how photoassociation spectroscopy and optical
Feshbach resonances are affected by a one-dimensional (1D)
or two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice.
In Section II, we
present the general theory of resonant collisions in a 1D and
2D optical lattice, building upon the works of D. S. Petrov
and G. V. Shlyapnikov [15] and M. Olshanii [14]. In section

II. OPTICAL RESONANCES IN A 1D OR 2D LATTICE

An optical lattice is obtained using a standing wave laser
which creates a sinusoidal periodic trap. Each well of this
trap conﬁnes the atoms in either a pancake-shaped cloud (for
1D lattices) or cigar-shaped cloud (for 2D lattices). For this
reason, we will refer to 1D lattices as a 2D (pancake) ge-
ometry, and to 2D lattices as 1D (cigar) geometry. We will
assume that there is little transfer between clouds in differ-
ent wells, so that we can treat each one independently. The
atoms in each cloud will be assumed free to move in the di-
rections which are not conﬁned by the lattice, ie, the trans-
verse directions x, y for a 1D lattice, and the axial direction
z for a 2D lattice. We will also describe the conﬁnement
induced by the lattice near the bottom of each well by a har-
monic potential, which is valid if the lattice is tight or strong
enough.

To describe optical resonances under such conﬁnement,
we use the theories of collisions in 1D or 2D geometries of
Refs. [14, 15]. We express these theories in paragraph II A in
terms of an energy-dependent scattering length a(k), which
is essentially the K-matrix for 3D collisions. The origi-
nal theories were formulated in terms of the usual (energy-
independent) scattering length, but taking into account the
energy-dependence extends the range of validity of the theo-
ries [16], and is necessary in the case of resonant collisions.
We then give the expression for a(k) in the case of resonant
collision in paragraph II B. Using this expression, we de-
duce the collision and photoassociation rates in 1D and 2D
geometries.

Similar methods have been used to treat speciﬁc cases: a
K-matrix approach was used in Ref. [17] to describe bosonic
resonant collisions in a 2D geometry, a multi-channel K-
matrix approach was used in Ref. [18] to describe collisions
of spin-polarized fermions in a 1D geometry, and a renor-
malization approach was used in Refs. [19, 20] to describe
resonant collisions of bosons in a 1D geometry. All these
works relate the effective 1D or 2D scattering properties to
the free-space properties. Also closely related are the con-

structions of pseudo-potentials which can treat conﬁned sys-
tems [21, 22, 23] and pseudo-potentials in low-dimensional
systems [22, 24].

A. Collisions in a 1D or 2D conﬁned geometry

Let us brieﬂy review here the method of Refs. [14, 15].
The stationary states ψ(r) for the relative motion of two
atoms conﬁned by a harmonic potential V (r) are given by
the Schrödinger equation

is their interaction potential, E is their relative motion en-
ergy. In a 2D geometry the trapping potential is:

where Ω is the frequency of the trap. In a 1D geometry, it is:

which deﬁnes the wave numbers p and q for the incoming

tive 2D (1D) scattering amplitude f E

long as kr0 . 1, there is a region [16] where the the wave
function is proportional to the usual 3D s-wave scattering
wave function

generally, it is related to the 3D elastic scattering matrix ele-
ment S(k) by:

At separation r larger than the range r0 of the interaction
potential U , the stationary states can be written as a linear
combination of products of a harmonic oscillator eigenstate
in the conﬁned direction and a free wave in the weak direc-
tion. We choose the conventional basis where each station-
ary state in the weak direction is asymptotically the sum of
an incident plane wave and a scattered wave (which is as-
sumed isotropic for low energies). In 2D and 1D, we have
respectively:

harmonic oscillator wave function of vibration index ν (prin-
cipal number n and angular momentum number m), p is the
wave number of the incoming 1D wave, and ~q is the wave
vector of the incoming 2D plane wave with wave number q.
For each state, the total energy E is composed of the oscil-
lator energy in the conﬁned direction, and the free particle
energy in the weak direction:

By matching (3) or (2) with (6), one ﬁnds the relation be-
tween the effective 1D or 2D scattering amplitude and the
scattering length [15, 27]:

Usual photoassociation in free space can be modelled
In the case of a

photoassociation resonance with an isolated molecular state,
one ﬁnds simple expressions for the scattering properties of
atoms under the inﬂuence of the laser light. For instance, the
s-wave elastic scattering matrix element reads:

Here, Sbg(k) is the s-wave elastic scattering matrix ele-
ment in the absence of light, E = ~2
k
2µ is the collision en-
ergy, E0 is the position of the resonance (with respect to the
ground-state threshold), Γ(k) is the stimulated width of the
resonance, and γ is the natural width of the resonant molec-
ular state. The stimulated width Γ(k) is due to the coupling
by the laser between the incoming scattering state and the
resonant molecular state, and is proportional to the intensity
of the laser light. The natural width γ is due to the decay of
the resonant molecular state by spontaneous emission. Be-
cause of this natural width, the scattering matrix element is
2 < 1), meaning that the collision
no longer unitary (
S(k)
|
|
is no longer elastic. This accounts for the fact that some
photoassociated pairs of atoms can deexcite by spontaneous
emission, and do not return to their initial state.
In most
cases, these pairs of atoms gain enough energy to leave the
trap where the system is conﬁned, or form bound molecules
[30], so that photoassociation is observed as a loss from the
initial atomic cloud. The observed loss serves as a basis for
photoassociative spectroscopy.

A magnetic Feshbach resonance is described by a formally
similar theory, where spontaneous emission is generally neg-
ligible (γ = 0).The following theory is therefore applicable
to a magnetic Feshbach resonance by setting γ
0 and
κ, where κ is the strength of the magnetic resonance.

scattering length from photoassociation spectra [8, 32].

The comparison of 2D or 1D rates with the more familiar
3D rates is not direct. It is more easily achieved at thermal
equilibrium. First, we can evaluate these rates assuming a

volved: the states of relative motion in the conﬁned direction
form a quasi-continuum as in free space. Thus, we expect to
retrieve the free-space results. Indeed, both in the 2D and 1D
theory, the effective 3D rates simplify to:

One can check that these expression are exactly the same as
the usual 3D rates (19). In particular, if the Wigner’s thresh-

In this regime, very few incoming states in the conﬁned

Both in 1D and 2D geometries, it is interesting to note that
the photoassociation rate now depends directly on the back-

As explained in Ref. [15], the logarithmic term leads to
a “conﬁned-induced” resonance when it cancels the term
a0/a(k0), which can be interpreted as the appearance of a
2D bound state at threshold. Since we assumed that a(k) al-
ready has a resonant character - Eq. (13), we may reinterpret
the logarithmic term as a shift in the position of this reso-
nance. Note that Eq. (37) was already considered in Ref. [17]
to describe a magnetic Feshbach resonance in a quasi-two-
dimensional gas.

At very low temperature in the 1D geometry, the zeta term

becomes close to ζ( 1

As explained in Ref. [14], the term ζ( 1
2 ) leads to a “conﬁned-
(cid:12)
induced” resonance when it cancels the term a0/a(√2/a0).
This again can be interpreted as a shift in the position of the
optical resonance.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Note that in a quasi-2D geometry, the resonance is increas-
ingly shifted by the logarithmic term when the temperature
is decreased, and it is broadened by a constant term i√π. In
contrast, in a quasi-1D geometry, the resonance is shifted by
a constant term ζ( 1
2 ), but is increasingly broadened as the
temperature is decreased.

G. Position of the resonance

In a typical experiment, the collision or photoassociation
rates are measured as a function of the laser frequency. In
a lattice, the frequency for which the laser is resonant (ie
which gives a peak in the rate) may be shifted from the ex-
pected free space resonant frequency. The lattice eliminates
the recoil shift but also introduces new shifts. In our equa-
tions, the free-space resonance is obtained for E0 = 0, there-
fore we deﬁne the lattice shift ∆E as the value of E0 which
maximizes (23) or (27).

There are several contributions to the shift. The ﬁrst one
is the zero-point energy, which can be easily understood as
follows. The relative motion of the ground-state atoms is
inﬂuenced by the conﬁnement, and therefore has the zero-
point energy, even for T = 0. On the other hand, the relative
motion in the excited molecular bound state is not affected
by the conﬁnement (only the centre-of-mass is). As a result,
the transition is shifted by the zero-point energy.

7

(43)

(44)

The thermal average in (23) and (27) also shifts the line
by a quantity of order kBT . Due to the dimensionality of
the integral involved in the averaging, this thermal shift will
differ from the usual 3D thermal shift.

In the 2D conﬁnement-dominated regime, we ﬁnd the fol-

qualitative insight by considering the on-resonance rate in
the conﬁnement-dominated regime, disregarding the thermal
average.

In most cases, species have a small scattering length
a0. In this limit, the on-resonance rates are essen-

We mentioned that the background scattering length abg
affects the photoassociation rate in a lattice, and in particular
it may shift the line if it is large enough (note that this is an
intrinsic molecular shift, not a density-dependent shift due to
interaction with other atoms [2]), however we ﬁnd this shift
to be very small in most cases.

Finally, at high intensity and low temperature, the line may
be shifted by the logarithmic term in a 2D geometry, or by
the zeta term in a 1D geometry. The 2D logarithmic shift
is potentially the most easily observable experimentally, be-
cause the line is not as broadened as in the 1D case. We ﬁnd
that the following formula gives a good approximation of the
shift in the quasi-2D regime at high intensity:

Interestingly, the “logarithmic shift” is proportional to the
optical length lopt. In free space, the optical length is usually
determined by measuring the rate (30) which is proportional
to it. However the rate can typically have a factor of 2 un-
certainty as its determination relies on the knowledge of the
density of atoms [8, 13]. Here we propose a determination of
lopt which does not require the knowledge of the density and
is is simply based on a spectroscopic measurement: by mea-
suring the position of the line for different intensities, one
should observe a shift linear with the intensity I, and deduce
the strength of the resonance lopt/I. The major constraint of
this method is to be able to reach and measure sufﬁciently
~Ω. One should also take into account
low temperatures
any possible light shift [33] (also proportional to the inten-
sity) by measuring it at higher temperatures.

≪

H. Line shape and strength

The shape and apparent strength of the line are also mod-
iﬁed by the lattice. In the conﬁnement-dominated regime,
we saw that the dimensionality of the thermal distribution
is reduced. As a result, the corresponding density of states
1/2 in 1D) gives more weight to
(
∼
small energies - compare Eqs. (35) and (36) with Eq. (30).
The line is therefore expected to be narrower, especially in
the 1D case. The precise strength of the line depends on
the density and the thermal averaging, but we can get some

One can see that the power broadening term klopt
in
Eq. (30) is now enhanced because the momentum is now
~/a0,
bounded from below by the zero-point momentum
and even much larger at small temperature in the quasi-1D
regime. It is therefore easier in a lattice to saturate the line
with lower laser intensities, even at very small temperature.
On the other hand, certain species may have a large scat-
tering length abg
a0. In this case, the rate explicitly de-
pends on the scattering length. For small laser intenstites
(lopt

abg, a0), the on-resonance rates are essentially:

We give an illustration of this dependence on abg in the

next Section in the case of Strontium 86.

In principle, this new dependence on the background scat-
tering length could be used as a way to improve its deter-
mination when it is large. This would bring complementary
information to the usual node method [8] which proves to be
difﬁcult for large scattering lengths as it requires a very pre-
cise knowledge of the long-range part of the potential. How-
ever, the typical uncertainties associated to measured rates in
current experiments may limit the interest of this idea.

III. ALKALINE-EARTH PHOTOASSOCIATION IN A 1D
OR 2D LATTICE

We illustrate the previous theory by considering alkaline-
earth intercombination photoassociation in a tight optical lat-
tice. An important feature of the intercombination line is the
low spontaneous emission from the photoassociated state.
While the natural width for allowed transitions is typically
tens of MHz, the width of the intercombination lines is typ-
ically tens of kHz. This is on the same order of magnitude
as the typical trapping frequency at the centre of each lat-
tice cell. As a result, we expect a clear manifestation of the
effects described in the previous section for alkaline-earth
intercombination transitions. On the other hand, they should
hardly be observable with allowed transitions, as they would
be hidden by the large natural width.

kHz. Black curves are the free-space 3D prediction - Eq. (29). Red curves are the effective 3D rate in a 2D geometry - Eq. (23). Green

the approximate line shapes calculated from Eqs. (32-34) (considering only the trap ground-state contribution) are represented by dashed
curves.

Figure 1 shows the effective photoassociation rate at dif-
ferent temperatures for a typical intercombination line of
Strontium 88 in free space, 1D lattice, and 2D lattice. The
scattering length of Strontium is taken to be 10 Bohr [8] (1
0.0529177 nm) and the spontaneous emission term
Bohr
γ = 15 kHz [13]. The trapping frequency Ω is 2π
50 kHz,
and the optical length is set to 1 Bohr. The temperatures
correspond to the three regimes discussed in Section II F:
free space (T = 100 µK and T = 20 µK), conﬁnement-
dominated (T = 4 µK ), and 2D regime (T = 0.1 µK ).

×

≈

For T = 100 µK and T = 20 µK (Fig. 1a and 1b), one
might expect the line shape to be very close to the free-space
theory prediction. This is indeed the case in a 2D geome-
try. However, higher temperatures are needed to reach the
free-space regime in a 1D geometry. For the temperatures
considered here, we observe a lot of distinct spikes in the 1D
photoassociation line. These spikes correspond to contribu-
tions from different trap states and are therefore separated by
the frequency Ω of the trap. There are similar contributions
in the 2D case, but they tend to overlap, due to their width.
In contrast, the spikes are very narrow in the 1D case, be-

cause the one-dimensional density of states scales like 1/√E
(see, for instance, Eq.(36)), which enhances low-energy col-
lisions. As a result each spike has a width close to the natural
width of the resonance and is well separated from the oth-
ers, even at relatively high temperatures (tens of µK) which
are more than one order of magnitude larger than the natural
width. This feature could be exploited to measure the posi-
tion of the line at nearly the natural width precision, while
operating at temperatures much larger than this width.

In the conﬁnement-dominated regime (Fig. 1c), the line
shape is dominated by the ﬁrst spike (contribution from the
trap ground state) and the line is clearly shifted due to the
zero-point energy. In the 2D case, the density of states leads
to a line which is more symmetric and narrower than in 3D,
resulting in an increase of the photoassociation rate on reso-
nance with respect to the free-space rate. This situation cor-
responds roughly to the experimental conditions of Ref. [13].
However, the experimental conditions were such that the 2D
and 3D theory happened to predict very similar rates, and
extra broadening mechanisms made it difﬁcult to observe an
unambiguous 2D line shape as in Fig. 1c. In the 1D case,

which is constant. The orange diamonds correspond to a tempera-
ture T = 0.4 µK, and the blue dots corresponds to a temperature
T = 0.1 µK. These points are obtained by calculating the line shape
using Eq. (38) and ﬁnding the shift numerically. For each point, we
represented a vertical line whose length corresponds to one tenth
of the photoassociation line width; this gives an indication of how
accurately the shift can be determined experimentally. The dashed
lines are obtained using the approximate formula Eq. (42).

the thermal distribution leads to an even narrower line and
higher rate, as small collision energies are enhanced by the
density of states.

kHz, lopt = 10 Bohr ≈ 0.0529 nm, T = 1 µK; conditions similar
to the experiment of Ref. [13]). Black curves are the free-space 3D
rate prediction, red and green curves are the effective 3D rate from
the 2D and 1D theories, using the effective scattering length (13)
; the dashed curves are obtained using the more usual expression
(17) for the scattering length. Panel (a): assuming abg = 600 Bohr
≈ 31.75 nm. Panel (b): assuming abg = 2000 Bohr ≈ 105.8 nm.
Note that the free-space rate does not depend on the background
scattering length abg.

In Fig. 2, we consider a higher optical length (lopt = 500
Bohr), which can be reasonably attained using the intercom-
bination lines close to thresold, or by increasing the photoas-
sociation laser intensity. The line is now power-broadened,
as predicted by Eq. (43), while the free-space line is not. In
the quasi-2D regime, the line is also shifted by the logarith-
mic term, according to Eq. (42). As suggested in Section
II G, this shift could be used as a way to measure the optical
length. However, the line is progressively power-broadened
as it is shifted. In Fig. 3, we plot the shift and width as a
function of the optical length. Although the experiment may
not be easy, this graph suggests that the shift should be ob-
servable.

In the quasi-2D or quasi-1D regime (Fig. 1d), the line is
almost unbroadened by temperature and recovers its natural
Lorentzian shape in all theories. The temperature is so low
that there is almost one collision energy in the system: 0

We now illustrate the theory with the intercombination
lines in Strontium 86. The background scattering length of
this species has been found to be quite large, between 610
and 2300 Bohr [8]. As a result, the photoassociation line in

10

the lattice is notably modiﬁed by the scattering length. In
Fig. 4, we plotted the photoassociation rate for abg = 600
Bohr and abg = 2000 Bohr. The effect of the scattering
length is clearly noticeable, as predicted qualitatively by
Eq. (45). As noted previousy, measurements of the rate for
different lattice wave lengths might be able to give a better
constraint on the scattering length.

We also plotted on Fig. 4 the effective rate obtained if
one replaces the effective scattering length (13) by the more
usual resonant scattering length (17). The latter appears to
be insufﬁcient to predict the correct rate for large scattering
length, showing that in this particular case, one cannot sim-
ply extrapolate the original work of Ref. [15] by replacing
the scattering length by the resonant scattering length (17).

effects are expected to be observable in the case of narrow
resonances, like the intercombination lines found in alkaline-
earth species. The main effects of conﬁnement are: shift of
the resonance (most importantly by the zero-point energy of
the lattice), narrower lines, increase of power-broadening at
low temperature, and direct sensitivity to a large value of the
scattering length of the atoms. More speciﬁcally, a 2D con-
ﬁnement could signiﬁcantly increase the spectroscopic reso-
lution, making it possible to observe the natural line width at
relatively high temperatures. At low temperature, a 1D con-
ﬁnement induces a shift of the line which is proportional to
the intensity of the photoassociation laser. This shift could
be used to determine the strength of a resonance, without
having to measure the density of the system.

IV. CONCLUSION

We investigated how photoassociation is affected by the
conﬁnement of a 1D or 2D optical lattice. We showed that

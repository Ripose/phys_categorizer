INTRODUCTION

Energies and transition rates for some radiative processes in atoms initially bearing two K-

shell holes (two-electron one-photon and one-electron one-photon transitions) were evaluated

in this work. This kind of atom, in which an entire inner shell is empty while the outer

shells are occupied, was ﬁrst named hollow by Briand et al. [1]. Hollow atoms are of great

importance for studies of ultrafast dynamics in atoms far from equilibrium and have possible

wide-ranging applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science [2].

A mono-ionized atom with a K-shell vacancy can decay through an L → K electron

transition with the emission of x-ray radiation called, in the Siegbahn notation, the Kα

diagram line. A one-electron transition line for which the initial state has two vacancies in

the same shell is called a hypersatellite line. This is the case when a double ionized K-shell
state decays through the transition of one L-shell electron (Fig. 1-a), K−2 → K−1L−1, which
is denoted by Kαh. A competing, less probable, process of radiative de-excitation from this
state is the simultaneous transition of two correlated electrons from higher shells, the K−2 →
L−2 transitions, accompanied by the emission of a single photon carrying the total energy,

called Kαα (Fig. 1-b). Predictions of this decaying process can be found in early papers at

the beginning of the twentieth century by Heisenberg [3] and Condon [4], but it has only

been observed since 1975 [5, 6].

For comparison with theory, we should distinguish between experiments in which the

initial atomic excitation uses electrons as projectiles

[7, 8, 9], photoionization or nuclear

decay [10], and experiments using heavy ions [5, 6, 11]. In the latter case, the probability

of multiple ionization is usually very high, leading to unreliable determination of energy

values. One of the reasons for the scarcity of accurate experimental data stems from the

very low intrinsic probability of creating a state with just two K-shell holes.

Theoretical calculations so far have mainly used perturbation theory and were performed

in a non-relativistic approach [12, 13] with the exception of Chen et al. work [14], in

which a Dirac-Hartree-Slater approach was used. Indeed, for medium-Z atoms the K-shell

electrons are already signiﬁcantly relativistic, thus calling for relativistic methods in atomic

data calculations. In this work we used the Dirac-Fock model to compute transition energies

for two-electron one-photon transitions arising from the de-excitation of double 1s hole states

leading to ﬁnal states with two L-shell holes in atoms with 12 ≤ Z ≤ 30. This is the region

2

of atomic numbers where the transition from the LS to the intermediate coupling scheme

occurs. This transition is reﬂected directly in the Kαh lines relative intensities. We also

computed the energies of the competing hypersatellite transitions. The results are compared

to experiment and other theoretical calculations.

II. CALCULATION OF ATOMIC WAVE FUNCTIONS AND ENERGIES

Bound state wave functions and radiative transition probabilities were calculated using

the multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock program of J. P. Desclaux and P. Indelicato [15, 16].

The program was used in single-conﬁguration mode because correlation was found to be

unimportant. The wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal states were computed independently,

that is, atomic orbitals were fully relaxed in the calculation of the wave function for each

state, and non-orthogonality was taken in account in transition probabilities calculations.

In order to obtain a correct relationship between many-body methods and quantum

electrodynamics (QED) [17, 18, 19, 20], one should start from the no-pair Hamiltonian

Hno pair =

HD(ri) +

V(|ri − rj|),

where HD is the one electron Dirac operator and V is an operator representing the electron-

The expression of Vij in the Coulomb gauge and in atomic units is

where rij = |ri − rj| is the inter-electronic distance, ωij is the energy of the photon exchanged
between the two electrons, αi are the Dirac matrices and c = 1/α is the speed of light, α

being the ﬁne structure constant. We use the Coulomb gauge as it has been demonstrated

that it provides energies free from spurious contributions at the ladder approximation level

and must be used in many-body atomic structure calculations [21, 22].

The term (3a) represents the Coulomb interaction, the term (3b) is the Gaunt (magnetic)

interaction, and the last two terms (3c) stand for the retardation operator. In this expression
the ∇ operators act only on rij and not on the following wave functions.

By a series expansion of the operators in expressions (3b) and (3c) in powers of ωijrij/c ≪

1 one obtains the Breit interaction, which includes the leading retardation contribution of

order 1/c2. The Breit interaction is, then, the sum of the Gaunt interaction (3b) and the

Breit retardation

(4)

In the many-body part of the calculation the electron-electron interaction is described by

the sum of the Coulomb and the Breit interactions. Higher orders in 1/c, deriving from the

diﬀerence between Eqs. (3c) and (4) are treated here only as a ﬁrst order perturbation.

All calculations are done for ﬁnite nuclei using uniformly charged spheres.

Finally, from a full QED treatment, one also obtains the radiative corrections (important

for the innermost shells) to the electron-nucleus interaction (self-energy and vacuum polar-

ization). The one-electron self-energy is evaluated using the one-electron values of Mohr

and coworkers

[23, 24, 25]. The self-energy screening is treated with the Welton method

developed in Refs. [26, 27, 28, 29]. This method yields results in close agreement (better

than 5%) with ab initio methods based on QED [30, 31, 32], without the huge amount of

eﬀort involved. The vacuum polarization is evaluated as described in Ref. [33]. The Uelhing

contribution is evaluated to all orders by being included in the self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF).

The Wichmann and Kroll and K¨all´en and Sabry contributions are included perturbatively.

All three contributions are evaluated using the numerical procedure from Refs. [34, 35].

Breit and QED contributions to the energy of some levels are shown in Table I for Mg,

Ca and Zn.

III. RESULTS

We calculated the energies of the Kαh hypersatellite transitions and the Kαα two-electron

one-photon transitions for atoms with 12 ≤ Z ≤ 30.

Depending on the conﬁgurations of the initial and ﬁnal states, for the diﬀerent values of

Z, the number of transitions that must be dealt with may range from only two, when the

initial state has only closed shells, to several hundred, when unﬁlled shells exist.

For Mg, Ar, Ca and Zn the 1s−2 ground conﬁguration corresponds to only one level, the

1S0 level, and each of the Kαα or Kαh lines is identiﬁed by a precise level transition,

Kα2α3:

1s−2 1S0 → 1s−12p−1 1P1
1s−2 1S0 → 1s−12p−1 3P1

To be able to compare our theoretical transition energy values with experiment and non-

relativistic calculations by other authors, we must deﬁne the statistical average energy of a

line. The energy of all individual i → f transitions in the X line, from an initial level i, Eif ,

weighted by the corresponding transition probability, Wif , yields the average energy of the

X line coming from level i, EX (i):

EX (i) =

Eif Wif

Pf (X)

Wif

Pf (X)

(5)

(6)

In Eq. (5), f (X) runs over all possible ﬁnal levels in the radiative de-excitation leading to

the X line, from a speciﬁc initial level i. Assuming that all states of a γ conﬁguration are

equally populated, the resulting EX (i) energies were then weighted by the statistical weight

of level i, g (i), leading to the statistical average energy ESA

X for the X line:

1

ESA

X =

g (γ) X

i

g (i) EX (i) .

Here, g (γ) is the statistical weight of the γ conﬁguration. We estimate the uncertainty of

transition energy values has being of the order of 1 eV.

In Table II, we tabulate the results obtained in this work for the two-electron one-photon

radiative transition energies and probabilities from a double K-hole state in aluminium. In

this table, the transitions in the Kαα lines were ordered by energy: two groups of transitions

well separated in energy are clearly identiﬁed, which we interpret as being the Kα2α3 and

Kα1α3 lines, respectively. Further details can be found in [36]. Afterwards, the transitions

were grouped, within each of these two groups of transitions, by their initial level, either

5

2P1/2 or 2P3/2. Transition probabilities for all Kαα two-electron one-photon transitions in

aluminium are shown in Fig. 2.

As can be seen in Table II, for aluminium the values of the average energy EX for

transitions starting from diﬀerent initial levels are very similar. This is also evident in

Table III, where the average energy values of the x-ray lines for diﬀerent initial levels of

titanium are presented. It is worth mentioning that 401 transition energies were computed

to obtain the results corresponding to the Kαα lines of the latter case.

To avoid time-consuming calculations, some authors have calculated just the 2s22p6 →

1s22s2p5 transition energy for all values of Z, thus neglecting the interaction with the outer

electrons. To check the magnitude of the error arising from this simpliﬁcation, we calculated

the transition energies for the atoms with Z = 12, 13, 18, 20, 21, 22, 28, 30, ﬁrst taking in

account all electrons and, in a separate calculation, including in the initial conﬁguration

only electrons in the L-shell.

For example, in the case of aluminium Kαα lines, we calculated the transition energy

for both the 2s22p63s23p →1s22s 2p53s23p and the 2s22p6 →1s22s 2p5 transitions. In the

particular case of Kα2α3, we found a 6.8 eV energy diﬀerence between the two energy values,

out of the 3056.54 eV transition energy (a diﬀerence of 0.2 %). Table IV gives the energy

values of the Kα2α3 line for the 8 elements considered, obtained through the two approaches

described. The energy diﬀerences, ∆Eth, thus obtained were then ﬁtted to a straight line

as a function of Z (Fig. 3). We found that the ﬁt is quite good, presenting a correlation

coeﬃcient of 0.998. Using the results of this ﬁtting process, and calculations where only the

2s22p6 electrons were included in the initial states, we obtained Kα2α3 transition energies

for the atoms with the remaining Z values.

Similar behaviour is also observed from the other lines obtained in the decay of a double

K-hole state (Kα1α3, Kαh

2, Kαh

1). Thus, using the same method, we were able to obtain

the transition energy values for other atoms, with values of Z between 12 and 30, for which

complete calculations would involve time-consuming work. For example, for iron (Z = 26)

it would be necessary to calculate around ﬁve thousand transition energy values to obtain

the energy of the Kαh

2 and Kαh

1 hypersatellite or Kα2α3 and Kα1α3 lines.

The results, for all elements with 12 ≤ Z ≤ 30, are presented in Table V and Table VI,

where they are compared with other theoretical calculations and experimental values. A

comparison between the results of this work for Kαh

2 line energies and other available results

6

is presented in Fig. 4.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we computed the energy of Kαh

1, Kα2α3 and Kα1α3 lines in the
framework of the Dirac-Fock approximation for elements with atomic number 12 ≤ Z ≤ 30.
For selected elements we performed two diﬀerent calculations: ﬁrst we took 1s−2 as the initial
conﬁguration, then we repeated the calculation, considering the 2s22p6 conﬁguration as the

2, Kαh

initial one. We ﬁtted the diﬀerences between the values obtained in the two calculations, as

a function of Z, to a straight line. We used this result to make a correction to the energies

of the remaining elements calculated using the 2s22p6 conﬁguration as the initial one.

These results can be compared with experimental work in which K-holes were obtained

using electron bombardment, photo ionization or radioactive decay. Other methods of pro-

ducing K shell holes, like ion bombardment, will inevitably produce extra holes in the atom,

leading to shifts in the measured value of the transition energy, unless the resolution obtained

with the detection process is high enough to allow for separation of the peaks resulting from

multiple vacancies.

The values obtained in this work for the Kαh

2 and Kαh

1 line energies are in excellent

agreement with the experimental results (see Fig. 4 for Kαh

emphasize the agreement with the measured Kαh

2 energies). We particularly
2 energy value of Mikkola et al. [37], for

Z = 12, Keski-Rahkonen et al. [38] for Z = 13, , and Diamant et al. [39], for Z = 29, due

to the reported high experimental precision. These authors resolved the x-ray lines using

crystal spectrometers.

In Table V we present a comparison between our calculated values and the available

experimental and theoretical data, in particular those obtained by Chen et al. [14] in the

framework of the Dirac-Hartree-Slater (DHS) method for Z = 18, 20, 25 and 30. The diﬀer-

ences between the present calculations and the DHS calculations are probably due mainly to

the diﬀerences in wave functions (ours were obtained with the optimized level (OL) method

and the DHS ones with the conﬁguration-average level method). Additionally, we used an

electron-electron operator that avoids coupling between positive and negative states, and we

included higher orders in 1/c of the Breit interaction.

Our results are closer to experiment than other theoretical results for the Kα2α3 line;

7

no previous calculation has been reported, to our knowledge, for the Kα1α3 line. A more

detailed comparison with the available experimental results reveals that, for 24 ≤ Z ≤ 29,

our values lie systematically higher (between 0.2% and 0.4%) than the experimental values,

outside the reported experimental uncertainty in all cases [9, 10]. Regarding the value of

Auerhammer et al. [7] for the Al (Z = 13) Kα2α3 line, some comments are in order. These
authors report the K−2 → L−2 two-electron one-photon lines as well as the K−2L−n →
L−(2+n) satellite lines, with n = 1, . . . , 4. They used the calculated values of Tannis et

al. [40] to propose the identiﬁcation of most of their measured transition lines. The line

with energy diﬀerence ∆E = E (Kαα) − 2E (Kα1) = 103.4 eV was labelled by them as the

Kα2α3 line. We suggest that this label should be attributed instead to their unidentiﬁed line

with energy ∆E = 84.8 eV, in much closer agreement with our calculated value ∆E = 82.2

eV.

stand for: a-Ref. [37], b-Ref. [38], c-Ref. [41], d-Ref. [9], e-Ref. [42, 43], f-Ref. [39, 44] and g-Ref. [45].

Since the Kαh

1,2 theoretical values obtained by Chen et al. [14] were presented in the form of energy
shifts from the corresponding diagram lines, we used the Kα1,2 energy values calculated by the
1 and the Kαh

same authors [46] in order to obtain the Kαh

2 transition energies. An asterisk indicates

that the authors presented experimental results asenergy shifts from the corresponding diagram

line. In these cases we took the diagram line energy values from [47].

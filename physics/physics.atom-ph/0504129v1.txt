We discuss a parity nonconserving asymmetry in the cross section of KLL dielectronic recombina-
tion of polarized electrons on the hydrogen-like ions with Z <
∼ 60. This eﬀect is strongly enhanced
because of the near-degeneracy of doubly-excited 2l2l′ states of opposite parity in He-like ions. For
ions with Z ∼ 30 the asymmetry is of the order of 10−9. For Z ≈ 48 a level crossing takes place,
leading to the PNC asymmetry of −1.3 × 10−8, which is 108 times greater than the basic strength
of the weak interaction in atoms.

INTRODUCTION

Parity nonconservation (PNC) is caused by the weak
interaction. According to the standard model this in-
teraction is described in terms of charged and neutral
currents. The charged currents play a dominant role in
nuclei, e.g. in β-decay. The neutral currents lead to the
PNC electron-nuclear interaction and can be observed in
atomic experiments [1].
In this paper we propose that
enhanced PNC eﬀects can be seen in electron recombi-
nation of multiply charged ions (MCI).

The ﬁrst suggestions and estimates of PNC eﬀects in
MCI were made in 1974 by Gorshkov and Labzowskii
[2]. A successful observation of PNC eﬀects in optical
experiments with heavy neutral atoms (see the recent
review [3] for references) has renewed the interest in PNC
eﬀects in MCI [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The obvious advantage
of MCI is the Z 5 scaling of the PNC matrix elements with
the nuclear charge Z, as opposed to Z 3 scaling in neutral
atoms [1].

However, this advantage is usually compensated by
larger energy diﬀerences between the levels of opposite
parity. Indeed, PNC eﬀects in atoms and ions appear be-
cause of the mixing of the levels of opposite parity. This
mixing leads, for example, to an admixture of a negative-
parity state ψ− to a positive-parity state ψ+ due to the
parity nonconserving weak interaction H PNC, ψ+ +iηψ−,

E± are proportional to Z 2 and a typical PNC mixing η
again scales as Z 3.

In some special cases the levels of opposite parity in
MCI can be anomalously close. For example, levels of the
conﬁgurations 1s2s and 1s2p in He-like ions cross several
times as Z varies [2]. Their proximity leads to a strong
enhancement of the PNC eﬀects. At the crossing point
(E− = E+) the maximal size of the mixing parameter is
limited by the level widths and can be estimated as:

According to Ref. [2], a crossing of the 1s2p 3P1 and
1s2s 1S0 levels takes place at Z
32. Because of the dif-
ference in the total electronic angular momentum, these
levels can only be mixed by the nuclear-spin-dependent
(NSD) part of the PNC interaction [9]. Two opposite-
parity levels with the total angular momentum J = 0,
1s2s 1S0 and 1s2p 3P0, cross twice at larger Z, around
65 and 90 [11]. For such ions one can expect enhanced

cases the detection schemes involve radiative transitions.
In this paper we propose to study PNC mixing in He-
like ions by looking at the parity-violating asymmetry in
KLL dielectronic recombination (DR) of electrons with
H-like ions. Here the PNC interaction manifests itself as
a diﬀerence between the recombination cross sections for
electrons with positive and negative helicities. The ob-
servation of such diﬀerence means a correlation between
the spin and momentum of the incident electron of the
p, which does violate parity, since p is a vector
form σ
and σ is a pseudovector (p
σ under
spatial inversion).

The PNC interaction in DR mixes the intermediate
doubly excited 2s2 and 2s2p states of the He-like ion,
which decay by the emission of a photon. In this respect
PNC eﬀects in DR are similar to those in neutron scat-
tering from heavy nuclei. PNC asymmetries of up to 10%
have been observed in nuclei by tuning the neutron en-
ergy to the p-wave compound nuclear resonances. This
enhancement over the typical size of the nuclear weak
interaction (10−7) is caused by the proximity of s- and

p-wave resonances, and by the large ratio of the s- to p-
wave neutron capture amplitudes (see, e.g., review [12]
and references therein).

KLL dielectronic recombination can be observed in ex-
periments with Electron Beam Ion Traps (EBITs) or ion
storage rings (see, e.g., [13]). However, these device do
not have a polarized ion target or electron beam, as is re-
quired. Furthermore, the present generation of devices do
not achieve the sensitivity required to observe the PNC
eﬀect. Criteria for the sensitivity requirements are out-
lined in section VI from which the feasibility can be es-
tablished for any future experimental devices.

The doubly excited 2l2l′ conﬁgurations contain a larger
number of closely spaced levels than the singly excited
1s2l conﬁgurations. In Sec. II we calculate the energies
of the doubly excited 2l2l′ states for 10
60 and
identify crossings between levels of opposite parity with
∆J = 0 and 1. We then estimate the widths of the close
levels of opposite parity and the PNC mixing coeﬃcients
η. In Sec. IV we evaluate the DR cross section and PNC
asymmetries. The paper concludes with a short feasibil-
ity analysis of PNC measurements in recombination of
MCI.

II. ENERGY LEVELS FOR THE 2l2l′ SHELL

The energies of the 2l2l′ states are determined by diag-
onalization of the eﬀective Hamiltonian in the n = 2 sub-
space. The eigenstates are obtained as
,
i
where lj and l′j′ deﬁne the hydrogen-like orbitals with
n = 2. The single-electron part of this Hamiltonian in-
cludes hydrogenic Dirac orbital energies and the Lamb
shift. The two-electron part of the Hamiltonian matrix
for the conﬁgurations 2s2, 2p2, and 2s2p is taken from
Ref.
[14]. This work presents it as a double expansion
in parameters 1/Z and αZ and we use three terms of
this expansion of order Z, Z(αZ)2, and Z 0 (atomic units
are used throughout the paper and α
1/137 is the ﬁne
structure constant).

P

≈

The Lamb shift appears in the higher order, Z(αZ)3,
but it is known to be essential for the level crossings
within the 1s2l′ manifold [2]. Below we show that this is
also true for the 2l2l′ states. By factoring out the main
dependence on Z and the principal quantum number n,
the Lamb shift for the hydrogenic orbital nlj is written
as

can see two crossings of the levels of opposite parity: a
pair of levels with ∆J = 1 cross at Z
17 and another
48. The latter crossing
pair with ∆J = 0 cross at Z
between (2s2)0 and (2s2p)0 levels is entirely due to the
Lamb shift. This crossing disappears if the Lamb shift
is neglected. Instead, another crossing with ∆J = 1 ap-
pears near Z = 42 between the levels (2p2)a
2 and (2s2p)b
1.
As seen in Fig. 2, their energies are very close for Z > 40.

≈

≈

≈

Of course, the exact position of the level crossings may
depend on the higher terms of the αZ expansion, which
17 is rather
are neglected here. The ﬁrst crossing at Z
sharp and takes place at relatively small Z, where radia-
tive corrections are still small. Therefore, this crossing is
known rather accurately. The crossing between the levels
(2s2)0 and (2s2p)0 is more sensitive. However, it should
not disappear when higher-order terms are included be-
cause of the Z 4 scaling of the Lamb shift (3). Finally,
the relative position of the (2p2)a
1 levels is
most sensitive to the higher order terms and they may
still cross at high Z.

2 and (2s2p)b

≈

The crossing at Z

17 leads to enhanced NSD PNC
eﬀects. The crossing at Z
48 is favorable for the ob-
≈
servation of the NSI part of the PNC interaction. Here
much larger PNC eﬀects can be expected due to their
scaling with Z. In addition, NSI interaction is roughly Z
times stronger than NSD interaction, see Sec. III A. Be-
cause of that we focus on the eﬀects due to PNC mixing
of the (2s2)0 and (2s2p)0 levels.

According to Eq. (2) the PNC mixing near the crossing
points depends on the line widths. For autoinizing states
the total width is the sum of the radiative and autoion-
izing widths, Γ = Γ(r) + Γ(a). In the non-relativistic hy-
drogenic approximation the radiative widths of the states

showed that κa ∼
of nucleons, and for heavy nuclei dominates over the con-
stant κeN [17]. One more contribution to the constant
κ was calculated by Flambaum and Khriplovich [17] and
by Bouchiat and Piketty [18]. Except for the very heavy
nuclei, this contribution is signiﬁcantly smaller than that
of the anapole moment.

Weak charges of the nuclei 203Tl and 133Cs were mea-
sured with high accuracy by Vetter et al. [19] and by
Wood et al. [20]. These measurements played an im-
portant role in low-energy tests of the standard model
(see review [21]). Up to now the only measurement of
the NSD PNC amplitude was made for 133Cs [20]. A
detailed discussion of this matter and a complete list of
references can be found in the recent review [3].

Because of the short-range nature of the interaction
in Hamiltonian (7) it eﬀectively mixes only one-electron
states with j = 1/2, i.e. ns1/2 and ˜np1/2. For a point-
like nucleus the corresponding matrix element turns to
inﬁnity because of the singular behaviour of the Dirac
orbitals at the origin. For a ﬁnite nucleus of the radius
Rnuc this matrix element can be approximately given by
the following expression [1, 22]:

The accuracy of these expressions is a few percent,

can easily be done using Dirac orbitals for the ﬁnite nu-
cleus. At 1% level of accuracy the details of the nu-
clear structure and radiative corrections become impor-
tant (see [10, 23, 24, 25] and references therein).

which decay by emission of a photon ω to the ﬁnal state n.

B. PNC mixings for He-like ions

Let us examine the enhancement of the PNC mixing
due to the proximity of the levels of opposite parity in
He-like ions. The mixing parameter η is estimated with
the help of Eqs. (1) and (9). The NSI part of the PNC
Hamiltonian mixes only states with ∆J = 0. Figure 2
shows that there is only one pair of close levels of opposite
parity which meets this requirement, namely (2s2)0 and
(2s2p)0. The ﬁrst of these states has admixtures of the
conﬁgurations 2p2
3/2 [see Eq. (6)]. For example,
for Z = 32 the weights of these conﬁgurations are 0.19
and 0.02, respectively. Thus, the interaction between
conﬁgurations 2s2 and 2p2 should be taken into account.
Using Eqs. (6) and (9), we obtain:

Results of the calculation of the PNC mixing for dif-
ferent Z are presented in Table I. The resonant enhance-
ment at the level crossing is not very pronounced. Firstly,
the level crossing is not sharp. Secondly, for Z > 30
the radiative width, which grows as Z 4, becomes greater
than the autoionizing width and for Z > 40 it exceeds
the level spacing. As a result, the absolute value of the
PNC mixing grows steadily with Z. However, the en-
hancement at the level crossing is clearly seen when we
consider the mixing strength divided by the Z 3R PNC
scaling parameter. The real part of the mixing changes
sign at the resonance, where η is equal to:

IV. PNC EFFECT IN DIELECTRONIC
RECOMBINATION

in DR is similar to that developed for PNC eﬀects in
neutron scattering (see, e.g., review by Flambaum and

Eq. (31) is valid for the polarized as well as unpolarized

in the second case Eq. (27) applies. For the unpolarized
electron beam σPNC must be averaged over the helicity
and Eq. (31) gives zero for the unpolarized target. How-
ever, for the polarized target σPNC is not zero, because
σPC in Eq. (20) selects the helicity through the branch-

V. RESULTS

Now we apply the formalism developed in the previ-
ous sections to calculate the PNC eﬀect in the DR cross
, 0) resonances in the
section at the energies near the (

±

He-like ions.
In the diagrams in Fig. 3 and in corre-
sponding equations (27) and (31) the states 1 and 2
can be either (2s2)0 and (2s2p)0, or vice versa. These
two contributions lead to the ﬁnal states n with diﬀer-
ent parities and we sum the corresponding cross sections,
σPC = σPC

1 + σPC

.

Equations (A3), (A5), and (A6) show that the phase
factor η1,2 in (31) is equal to 1. The incident electron
energy scales as Z 2 and the Coulomb phase shifts in
the non-relativistic approximation are independent of Z,
0.953. Taking this into account and using
δsp ≡

where the real and imaginary parts of η are close, the
second term in brackets in (32) becomes important. As
a result, the asymmetry changes sign through the reso-
nance. Finally, for Z = 48 and Z = 60 the imaginary
part of η is larger and the asymmetry is mostly nega-
tive. Note, that after the level crossing, the two terms
in (32) add constructively between the resonances. This
leads to a single negative peak for the PNC asymmetry
for Z = 60.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

It is useful to estimate the feasibility of measuring the
PNC asymmetry in KLL recombination calculated above
and from this estimate derive the sensitivity requirements
for an experimental apparatus capable of observing the
PNC using the scheme proposed. The number of counts
in an experiment with a fully polarized electron beam
with positive helicity is given by:

N+ = jeNitǫσ+

Iσ+,

≡

(34)

where je is the electron ﬂux, Ni is the number of tar-
get ions, t is the acquisition time, and ǫ is the detection
eﬃciency. The number of counts for negative helicity is
N− = Iσ−.

For a beam or target with polarization P , to detect
the PNC asymmetry, the diﬀerence between the counts,
should be greater than statistical error,

(35)

where σb is the magnitude of any background occurring
through direct radiative recombination or as an experi-
mental artifact (e.g. detector dark counts). We express
this as a cross section for convenience although for exper-
imental artifact background signal, this is the eﬀective
cross section to which the apparatus background would
correspond. For the rest of this analysis we consider the
ideal limit, P = 1, σb = 0.

Equation (35) is valid for a mono-energetic electron
beam. If the electron energy spread in the beam is greater
than the resonance spacing and widths, then the ﬂux je

sections are in barns (10−24 cm2) and energy in eV. As
expected, measurements become more feasible at large Z,
where the PNC asymmetry is greater. We also see that
the averaged PNC eﬀect is strongly suppressed for ions
with 38
40 and then steadily grows with Z (Fav
decreases). This suppression is caused by the change of
the sign of the asymmetry through the resonances (see
Fig. 4) and it is absent for the mono-energetic electron
beam. In the latter case the strongest eﬀect can be seen
for Z = 50, i.e. near the level crossing.

to the level crossing.

It is worth noting that F −1 and F −1

av have the same
dimensions as a cross section and a resonance strength
respectively. Indeed, these quantities are useful for esti-
mating the feasibility of any future experiment designed
to observe the PNC eﬀect in KLL dielectronic recombina-
tion resonances. For an experiment to be able to observe
the eﬀect predicted, it would have to be able to detect a
cross section as small as F −1 or a resonance strength as
small as F −1
av , i.e. about 10−11 bn or 10−11 bn eV, in the
absence of background. Of course, this is extremely de-
manding, but it is worth remarking that the level crossing
considered here, gives rise to an enhancement of eight or-
ders of magnitude compared to the basic strength of the
weak interaction in atoms.

Let us compare the present scheme with other propos-
als for measuring PNC in ions. Pindzola [6] suggested

However, that estimate neglected the radiative widths of

It is demonstrated that Breit and negative-energy state
contributions reduce the 2.5σ deviation [S.C. Bennett and
C.E. Wieman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 2484 (1999)] in the value
of the weak charge of 133Cs from the Standard Model predic-
tion to 1.7σ. The corrections are obtained in the relativis-
tic many-body perturbation theory by combining all-order
Coulomb and second-order Breit contributions. The correc-
tions to parity-nonconserving amplitudes amount to 0.6% in
133Cs and 1.1% in 223Fr. The relevant magnetic-dipole hy-
perﬁne structure constants are modiﬁed at the level of 0.3%
in Cs, and 0.6% in Fr. Electric-dipole matrix elements are
aﬀected at 0.1% level in Cs and a few 0.1% in Fr.

Atomic parity-nonconserving (PNC) experiments com-
bined with accurate atomic structure calculations pro-
vide constrains on “new physics” beyond the Standard
Model of elementary-particle physics. Compared to high-
energy experiments or low-energy ep scattering exper-
iments, atomic single-isotope PNC measurements are
uniquely sensitive to new isovector heavy physics [1].
Presently, the PNC eﬀect in atoms was most precisely
measured by Boulder group in 133Cs [2]. They de-
termined ratio of PNC amplitude EPNC to the tensor
transition polarizability β for 7S1/2 − 6S1/2 transition
with a precision of 0.35%.
In 1999, Bennett and Wie-
man [3] accurately measured tensor transition polariz-
ability β, and by combining the previous theoretical de-
terminations of the EPNC [4,5] with their measurements,
they have found a value of the weak charge for 133Cs
QW = −72.06(28)expt(34)theor which diﬀered from the
prediction [6] of the Standard Model QW = −73.20(13)
by 2.5 standard deviations. They also reevaluated the
precision of the early 1990s atomic structure calcula-
tions [4,5], and argued that the uncertainty of the pre-
dicted EPNC is 0.4%, rather than previously estimated
1%. This conclusion has been based on a much bet-
ter agreement of calculated and recently accurately mea-
sured electric-dipole amplitudes for the resonant transi-
tions in alkali-metal atoms.

In view of the reduced uncertainty, the purpose of this
Letter is to evaluate contributions from negative-energy
states (NES) and Breit interaction.
It will be demon-
strated that these contributions correct theoretical EPNC
and the resultant value of the weak charge by 0.6% in
Cs. It is worth noting, that due to the smallness of these

contributions at what had been believed to be a 1% the-
oretical error in Cs, the previous calculations have either
omitted [5], or estimated the contributions from Breit
interaction only partially [4]. The main focus of the pre-
vious ab initio calculations has been correlation contribu-
tion from the residual Coulomb interaction (i.e. beyond
Dirac-Hartree-Fock level).
In both calculations impor-
tant chains of many-body diagrams have been summed
to all orders of perturbation theory.

This Letter also reports correction due to NES and
Breit interaction for EPNC in francium. The interest in
Fr stems from the fact that analogous PNC amplitude is
18 times larger in heavier 223Fr compared to Cs [7]. The
measurement of atomic PNC in Fr is pursued by Stony
Brook group [8].

The quality of theoretical atomic wave-functions at
small radii is usually judged by comparing calculated and
experimental hyperﬁne-structure magnetic-dipole con-
stants A, and in the intermediate region by comparing
electric-dipole matrix elements. It will be demonstrated
that the corresponding corrections to all-order Coulomb
values are at the level of a few 0.1%.

The PNC amplitude of nS1/2 → n′S1/2 transition can
be represented as a sum over intermediate states mP1/2

The overwhelming contribution from parity-violating in-
teractions arises from the Hamiltonian

HW =

GF√8

QWρnuc(r)γ5 ,

(2)

where GF is the Fermi constant,γ5 is the Dirac ma-
trix, and ρnuc(r) is the nuclear distribution. To be
consistent with the previous calculations the ρnuc(r) is
taken to be a Fermi distribution with the “skin depth”
a = 2.3/(4 ln 3) fm and the cutoﬀ radius c = 5.6743
fm for 133Cs as in Ref. [4], and c = 6.671 fm for 223Fr
as in Ref. [7]. The PNC amplitude is customarily ex-
pressed in the units of 10−11i(−QW/N ), where N is
the number of neutrons in the nucleus (N = 78 for
133Cs and N = 136 for 223Fr ). Atomic units are
used throughout the Letter. The results of the calcu-
lations for 133Cs are EPNC = −0.905× 10−11i(−QW/N ),

. (4)

Ref. [4] and EPNC = −0.908× 10−11i(−QW/N ), Ref. [5].
The former value includes a partial Breit contribution
+0.002×10−11i(−QW/N ), and the latter does not. Both
calculations are in a very close agreement if the Breit con-
tribution is added to the value of Novosibirsk group. The
reference many-body Coulomb value

EC
PNC = −0.9075 × 10−11i(−QW/N )

(3)

is determined as an average of the two, with Breit con-
tribution removed from the value of Notre Dame group.
For 223Fr EPNC = 15.9 × 10−11i(−QW/N ), Ref. [7], this
value does not include Breit interaction.
Ab initio relativistic many-body calculations of wave-
functions, like coupled-cluster type calculations of [4,9],
to avoid the “continuum dissolution problem” [10], start
from the no-pair Hamiltonian derived from QED [11].
The no-pair Hamiltonian excludes virtual electron-
positron pairs
from the resulting correlated wave-
function. If the no-pair wave-functions are further used
to obtain many-body matrix elements, the negative-
energy state (NES) contribution is missing already in
the second order. Recently,
it has been shown that
the magnetic-dipole transition amplitude both in He-like
ions [12] and alkali-metal atoms [13] can be strongly af-
fected by the NES correction. The enhancement mecha-
nism is due to vanishingly small lowest-order values and
also due to mixing of large and small components of a
Dirac wavefunction by magnetic-dipole operator. For the
NES (E < −mc2) the meaning of large and small com-
ponents is reversed, i.e., small component is much larger
than large component. The mixing of large positive-
energy component with small component of NES results
in much larger one-particle matrix elements, than in the
no-pair case. The 2mc2 energy denominators lessen the
eﬀect, but, for example, the Rb 5S1/2 − 6S1/2 magnetic-
dipole rate is reduced by a factor of 8 from the no-pair
value by the inclusion of NES [13]. The inclusion of
Breit interaction also becomes important and the size
of the correction is comparable to the Coulomb contribu-
tion. Just as in the case of magnetic-dipole operator, the
Dirac matrix γ5 in the weak Hamiltonian Eq. (2) mixes
large and small components of wavefunctions. Similar
mixing occurs in the matrix element describing interac-
tion of an electron with nuclear magnetic moment (hy-
perﬁne structure constant A). As demonstrated below,
the relative eﬀect for these operators is not as strong
as in the magnetic-dipole transition case, since the low-
est order matrix elements are nonzero in the nonrela-
tivistic limit, but is still important. It is worth noting
that the problem of NES does not appear explicitly in
the Green’s function [5] or mixed-parity [4] approaches;
however the correction due to Breit interaction still has
to be addressed. The NES Coulomb corrections have to
be taken into account explicitly in the “sum-over-states”
method [4], employing all-order many-body values ob-
tained with the no-pair Hamiltonian.

The analysis is based on the VN −1 Dirac-Hartree-Fock

potential wave-functions, with the valence and virtual or-
bitals m calculated in the “frozen” potential of core or-
bitals a. The second-order correction to a matrix element
of one-particle operator Z between two valence states w
and v is represented as

This expression takes into account the residual (two-

interaction is used in this work. The tilde denotes an-
tisymmetric combination ˜bijkl = bijkl − bijlk. Subscript
i ranges over both core and excited states. Note that
summation over states i and m includes negative-energy
states. The NES correction to PNC amplitudes arises in
two circumstances, directly from the sum in Eq. (1) and
in the values of electric-dipole and weak interaction ma-
trix elements. If the length-gauge of the electric-dipole
operator is used, the direct contribution of NES in the
amplitude Eq. (1) is a factor of 10−13 smaller than the
total amplitude, and will be disregarded in the following.
The numerical summations are done using 100 positive-
and 100 negative-energy wavefunctions in a B-spline rep-
resentation [14] obtained in a cavity with a radius of 75
a.u.

The breakdown of second-order corrections to matrix
elements of weak interaction for Cs is given in Table I.
The all-order values from Ref. [4] are also listed in the ta-
ble to ﬁx the relative phase of the contributions. The ma-
trix elements are each modiﬁed at 0.6-0.7% level. Most
of the correction arises from positive-energy Breit con-
tribution, negative-energy states contribute at a smaller
but comparable level. The contributions from NES due
to one-body and two-body Breit interaction are almost
equal ( B(1)
+ . The
same relations hold also in francium. The corrections to
the relevant length-form matrix elements are overwhelm-
ingly due to the one-body Breit interaction, and are at
0.1% level. For example, the all-order reduced matrix
element h6S1/2||D||6P1/2i = 4.478 Ref. [9] is increased
by 0.005, bringing the total 4.483 into an excellent agree-
ment with experimental value [15] 4.4890(65). Generally,
the corrections reduce absolute values of the weak inter-
action matrix elements, and increase absolute values of
the dipole matrix elements, therefore, their net contribu-
tions to EPNC have an opposite sign. Matrix elements
of weak interaction are aﬀected more strongly, because
of the sampling of wave-function in the nucleus, where
relativity is important.

+ ≈ 2B(2)

As demonstrated in Ref. [4], the four lowest-energy va-
lence mP1/2 states contribute 98% of the sum in Eq. (1),
and for the purposes of this work, limiting the sums to
only these states is suﬃcient. The corrections to EPNC

2

are calculated ﬁrst by replacing the weak interaction ma-
trix elements with the relevant second-order contribu-
tions and at the same time using all-order dipole matrix
elements, and second by taking all-order HW matrix ele-
ments, and replacing D with the appropriate correction.
In both cases the experimental energies are used in the
denominators. The needed all-order matrix elements for
Cs are tabulated in Ref. [4]. The summary of corrections
to EPNC is presented in Table II. The modiﬁcations in
the weak interaction matrix element provide a dominant
correction. The contribution due to NES in the Coulomb
part is insigniﬁcant, and is already eﬀectively included in
the reference many-body Coulomb value EC
PNC, Eq. (3).
The reference value EC
PNC is modiﬁed by the Breit con-
tributions by 0.6%, almost two times larger than the un-
certainty in the Boulder experiment [2]. The modiﬁed
value is

EC+B
PNC (133Cs) = −0.902(36) × 10−11i(−QW/N ) .

A 0.4% uncertainty had been assigned to the above re-
sult following analysis of Bennett and Wieman [3]. When
EC+B
PNC is combined with the experimental values of tran-
sition polarizability β [3] and EPNC/β [2], one obtains
for the weak charge

QW(133Cs) = −72.42(28)expt(34)theor .

This value diﬀers from the prediction of the Standard
Model QW = −73.20(13) by 1.7σ, versus 2.5σ discussed
in Ref. [3], where σ is calculated by taking uncertainties
in quadrature.

The only previous calculation of Breit contribution to
PNC amplitude in Cs has been performed by the Notre
Dame group [4], using mixed-parity Dirac-Hartree-Fock
formalism. The one-body Breit interaction has been in-
cluded on equal footing with the DHF potential, but the
linearized modiﬁcation to one-body Breit potential due
to HW (VPNC−HFB in notation of Ref. [4]) has been omit-
ted.
It is straightforward to demonstrate that because
of this omission, the comparable contribution from two-
body part of the Breit interaction has been disregarded.
In units of 10−11i(−QW/N ), the result of the present
calculation for one-body Breit contribution is 0.003 ver-
sus 0.002 in Ref. [4]. Such disagreement is most prob-
ably caused by diﬀerent types of correlation contribu-
tion included in the two approaches. Treating one-body
Breit together with the DHF potential eﬀectively sums
the many-body contributions from one-body Breit inter-
action to all orders, and presents the advantage of the
scheme employed in Ref. [4]. However, the dipole matrix
elements and energies in the sum Eq. (1) are eﬀectively
included at the DHF level in the formulation of Ref. [4],
in contrast to high-precision all-order values employed in
the present work. The diﬀerence between the two val-
ues can be considered as a theoretical uncertainty in the
value of the Breit correction. Clearly more work needs
to be done to resolve the discrepancy. The accuracy of
the present analysis can be improved if the one-body Breit

interaction is embodied in DHF equations, and the many-
body formulation starts from the resulting basis. How-
ever, to improve present second-order treatment of the
two-body part of the Breit interaction, higher orders of
perturbation theory have to be considered. Apparently
the most important contribution would arise from terms
linearized in the Breit interaction, i.e. diagrams contain-
ing one matrix elements of the Breit interaction and the
rest of the residual Coulomb interaction.

± = −0.131, two-body Breit B(2)

The Breit and NES corrections to PNC amplitude
in heavier Fr are more pronounced. The 223Fr PNC
amplitude 15.9 ×10−11i(−QW/N ) from Ref. [7] is re-
duced by 1.1%. Using all-order dipole matrix elements
from Ref. [9], the following corrections due to modiﬁca-
tions in the hW are found (in units of 10−11i(−QW/N )):
one-body Breit B(1)
± =
−0.053, and the C− correction, implicitly included in
Ref. [7], is −0.003. As in the case of Cs, the all-order
no-pair Coulomb result [9] for reduced matrix element
h7P1/2||D||7S1/2i = 4.256 is increased by inclusion of the
Breit interaction and NES by 0.0011, a 0.3% modiﬁca-
tion, leading to a much better agreement with experi-
mental value 4.277(8) [16]. The modiﬁcation of the EPNC
due to corrections in the dipole matrix elements is much
smaller than in the case of hW. At present there is no
tabulation of accurate matrix elements of weak interac-
tion for Fr, and the inﬂuence on EPNC due to the Breit
contribution in dipole matrix elements is estimated from
average of the modiﬁcation of individual dipole matrix
elements 0.2%. The net
result decreases the reference
Coulomb value for 223Fr [7] by 0.18 ×10−11i(−QW/N ),
and the corrected value is

EC+B
PNC (223Fr) = 15.7 × 10−11i(−QW/N ) .

Finally, it is worth discussing Breit and NES contribu-
tions to hyperﬁne-structure magnetic-dipole constants A
for the states involved into PNC calculations. The all-
order no-pair Coulomb values in the recent work [9] have
been corrected using a similar second-order formulation;
no details of the calculation have been given. The ex-
plicit contributions listed in Table III will be useful for
correcting ab initio many-body Coulomb values. The ta-
ble presents the contributions for two lowest valence S1/2
and P1/2 states. The calculations are performed using a
model of uniformly magnetized nucleus with a magneti-
zation radius Rm given in the table. One ﬁnds that the
additional terms reduce values calculated in the no-pair
Coulomb-correlated approach. For Cs the corrections are
of order 0.2% for 6S1/2, 0.1% for 7S1/2, and 0.3% for
6P1/2 and 7P1/2. The relative contributions to hyperﬁne
constants in heavier Fr are larger, accounting for 0.5% of
the total value for 7S1/2, 0.4% for 8S1/2, and 0.6% for
7P1/2 and 8P1/2.

This work demonstrates that the Breit and NES con-
tributions are comparable to the remainder of Coulomb
correlation corrections unaccounted for in modern rela-
tivistic all-order many-body calculations and hence have

to be systematically taken into account.
In particu-
lar, the Breit interaction contributes 0.6% to parity-
nonconserving amplitudes in Cs and 1.1% in Fr. The
correction for Cs is almost twice the experimental un-
certainty and reduces the recently determined [3] 2.5 σ
deviation in the value of weak charge from the Stan-
dard Model prediction to 1.7σ. Both hyperﬁne constants
and electric-dipole matrix elements are aﬀected at a few
0.1%. By including NES and Breit correction, the no-pair
Coulomb all-order dipole matrix elements [9] for resonant
transitions are brought into an excellent agreement with
the accurate experimental values.

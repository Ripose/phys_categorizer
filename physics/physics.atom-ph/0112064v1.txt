Abstract

A generalized formalism of the so-called non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics is presented,

which applies for atomic many-body systems in external laser ﬁelds. The theory treats the nu-

clear dynamics and electronic transitions simultaneously in a mixed classical-quantum approach.

Exact, self-consistent equations of motion are derived from the action principle by combining

time-dependent density functional theory in basis expansion with classical molecular dynamics.

Structure and properties of the resulting equations of motion as well as the energy and momentum

balance equations are discussed in detail. Future applications of the formalism are brieﬂy outlined.

INTRODUCTION

chemistry.

The non-adiabatic dynamics of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in atomic many-

body systems represents one of the fundamental processes in diﬀerent areas of physics and

Experimentally, exceptional large progress has been made during the last decade in

studying non-adiabatic processes, in particular in molecules and atomic clusters. So, ex-

periments with intense femto-second laser pulses interacting with molecules [1] or atomic

clusters [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] have revealed a variety of fascinating new, typical non-adiabatic

phenomena like the production of keV electrons [2], MeV ions [3] and intense x-rays [4]; the

Coulomb explosion [5] connected even with nuclear fusion [6]; the multiple plasmon exci-

tation and relaxation in metallic clusters [7], or the unexpected enhanced ionization with

decreasing laser intensity [8]. Moreover, pump-probe experiments allow now to investigate

the time-resolved non-adiabatic dynamics, e.g. of photoinduced isomerization processes (for

a review see [9]). Finally, reﬁned scattering experiments involving metal clusters [10] and

fullerenes [11] revealed detailed insight into electronic and vibronic excitation mechanisms,

as well as their coupling and related fragmentation processes in those complex systems.

Theoretically, the non-adiabatic coupling of electronic and nuclear dynamics is one of the

most challenging problems of atomic many-body theory and, in principle, requires the solu-

tion of the full time-dependent electron-nuclear Schr¨odinger equation. At present, however,

a full-scale numerical solution is barely feasible for the smallest possible molecular system,
the H+

2 molecule [12]. Thus, for larger systems like atomic clusters, phenomenological models,

based on classical mechanics and/or hydrodynamics [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] have been devel-

oped to investigate the mechanism of the intense laser-cluster interaction. More microscopic

approaches are based on electronic time-dependent Thomas-Fermi theory [19, 20, 21] or

related semiclassical (meanﬁeld) approximations [22, 23] coupled with molecular dynamics

(MD) for the nuclear motion. The most advanced microscopic theory to study the coupled

electronic and ionic dynamics in intense laser-cluster interaction developed so far, is based

on time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (DFT) in local density approximation

(LDA) for the treatment of the electronic system coupled with classical MD for the nuclear

(ionic) dynamics [24, 25]. In this approach, the TD-Kohn-Sham equations are numerically

solved on a grid with the consequence that full 3D calculations [24] are still on the edge

2

of available computational facilities. Therefore, the upper most applications of this theory

have been obtained within an eﬀective two-dimensional approximation [25] (see [26] for a

review).

An alternative fully microscopic approach to the nonadiabatic dynamics in atomic many-

body systems is the so-called nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NA-QMD), devel-

oped recently [27]. In this method, electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom are treated

simultaneously and self-consistently by combining classical MD with TD-DFT in a ﬁnite-

basis-set expansion of the Kohn-Sham-orbitals. The formalism [27] has been worked out

for conservative systems, in particular to investigate adiabatic and non-adiabatic collisions

involving molecules and atomic clusters. So the NA-QMD theory has been successfully

applied so far for the description and interpretation of fragment correlations in collision-

induced dissociation [28], charge transfer cross sections [29, 30, 31], as well as the excitation

and fragmentation processes [32, 33] in collisions of atoms (ions) with small sodium clusters

and systems as large as fullerenes.

In this work, we present a generalization of the NA-QMD formalism [27] (hereafter refered

to as I), suitable to describe also the interaction of large, but still ﬁnite atomic many-body

systems with external laser ﬁelds. We derive and discuss the exact equations of motion in

a systematic way, starting from a general mixed classical-quantum treatment. Energy and

momentum balance equations are derived as well. Necessary approximations and possible

simpliﬁcations to the exact equations of motion as well as future applications of the formalism

are brieﬂy summarized.

II. THEORY

A. General mixed classical-quantum treatment

We consider ﬁrst the general case of a mixed classical-quantum system consisting of

interacting particles. The Ni classical particles are described by their trajectories R ≡

{R1(t), . . . , RNi(t)}. They are determined by an explicit time-dependent potential U(R, t)

as well as the interaction with a system of Ne quantummechanical particles, described by

their many-body wave function Ψ = Ψ(r1, . . . , rNe, t) (We omit the spin index). This is
determined by an explicit time-dependent Hamiltonian ˆH(R, t) which on his part depends

3

parametrically on R. The action of such a system consists of a classical and a quantum part

Equations (4) and (5) have to be solved simultaneously. They represent the general equations

of motion of the mixed classical-quantum system deﬁned above. They are much more

universal than those derived in I from energy conservation. Here they are obtained from a

general action principle where both, the potential U (deﬁning the classical system) and the
Hamiltonian ˆH (deﬁning the quantum system as well as the coupling to the classical one)

may explicitely depend on time. There is no energy or momentum conservation, nevertheless

classical motion R(t) and quantum dynamics |Ψ(t)i are coupled self-consistently owing to

the action principle.

In the next subsection, the potential U and the Hamiltonian ˆH will be speciﬁed for an

atomic many body system, we are interested in.

B. Atomic many body system

Considering now Ni ions (nuclei) with charge ZA (A = 1, . . . , Ni) and Ne electrons exposed

to an external laser potential (usually, but not necessarily, described in dipole approximation

The ﬁrst term in (8) is time dependent via R(t) and the second one explicitely depends on

time. Using the deﬁnition of the single particle density

ρ(r, t) = Ne ·

d3r2 . . . d3rNiΨ∗(r, r2, . . . , rNe, t) · Ψ(r, r2, . . . , rNe, t)

(10)

Thus, the electronic forces acting on the nuclei are determined by the single particle density

ρ(r, t) alone, which is the key quantity in DFT. So, in the next subsection we will reformulate

the whole problem using TD-DFT to describe the electronic system.

C. TD-DFT coupled with MD

According to the basic theorems of TD-DFT [34] any observable of a many body system

can be expressed as functional of the single particle density (9) and this density can be

is a functional of the density ρ(r, t) and contains the exchange-correlation contribution Axc.

In concrete applications of TD-DFT, the latter is subject of adequate approximations, like

the time dependent local density approximation (TD-LDA) or the time dependent optimized

potential method [35]. In this paper we will not specify Axc and, thus, are dealing with exact

equations of motion.

In this sense, variation of (12), (13) with respect to the KS-orbitals leads to

In (15), the interaction potential Vint(r, R), as part of V (r, R, t), is deﬁned according to (8).

The resulting equations of motion (14), (15) are completely equivalent to (4), (5) and

accordingly to (10). So, with the help of (11) one immediately realizes that (15) is identi-

cal to (10). The many body Schr¨odinger equation (4), however, is now replaced by a set

of Ne coupled integro-diﬀerential single particle KS-equations (14).

In the present form,

these equations have to be solved numerically on a grid, which still is very demanding (if

not impossible, at present, for large systems in intense laser ﬁelds; see also discussion in

the next section.). A drastic simpliﬁcation can be achieved, if the (3+1)-dimensional KS-

orbitals Ψj(r, t) are represented in a ﬁnite basis set. This, however, complicates the classical

equations of motion (15) considerably as will be discussed in the next section.

D. TD-DFT in basis expansion coupled with MD

In this section, we derive the ﬁnal equations of motion of the general NA-QMD formal-

ism and discuss their properties, in particular the resulting energy and momentum balance

The central starting point is to expand the time dependent KS-orbitals Ψj(r, t) in a local

with the expansion coeﬃcients aj

α(t) and the symbol Aα denotes the atom to which the

atomic orbital φα is attached.

Although technical details are not the topic of this paper, we note in passing, that the

use of the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO-ansatz (17)) has clear advantages as

compared to a direct numerical solution of the Kohn-Sham equations (14). First of all (and

obviously), the (3+1)-dimensional problem(14)) will be reduced to a one-dimensional one

for the determination of the coeﬃcients aj

α(t). Second (and especially important, if intense

laser ﬁelds are considered), electrons with basically diﬀerent spatial extensions (strongly

bound core electrons, binding valence electrons as well as practically free electrons in the

continuum) can be naturally included in the dynamical treatment, provided appropriate

basis functions φα are taken into account [36].

Equations (32) and (34) represent the central result in the derivation of the generalized

formalism of the NA-QMD. The Kohn-Sham equations (32) are formally very similar to that

derived in I, but now also contain the laser ﬁeld which couples to the electronic system (see

9

deﬁnition Hαβ (21), Veﬀ (16), V (8) ). The classical equations (34) include the laser ﬁeld as

well, which here acts on the nuclei (see deﬁnition of U(R, t) (6) ). Moreover, the quantum

part of the forces in (34) diﬀers appreciable from that derived in I obtained from energy

conservation. In particular, the last term in (35) results from the variational principle. It

represents an important contribution if the momentum balance is considered in the present

basis set formalism (see below). Obviously, this term vanishes if the basis is complete, i.e. if

holds. It will be shown below, that in this case also the remaining terms of the electronic

contribution to the forces in (34), (35) are drastically simpliﬁed. In any practical applications

of the formalism, however, the completeness relation (36) can never be fulﬁlled, and thus,

the full equations of motion (34) have to be considered.

At ﬁrst glance, the complicated structure of the forces in (34), (35) makes it diﬃcult to

give a transparent interpretation of the correction term resulting from the basis. From the

theoretical point of view it is therefore very useful to present (34), (35) in an alternative

(operator) form and rederive the KS-equations (32) from a basis constrained single particle

hamiltonian deﬁned as

ˆh′ = ˆt + Veﬀ + ˆX

with ˆh = ˆt + Veﬀ the usual KS-hamiltonian from (14), (16) and the additional operator

ˆX := ˆP ˆh ˆP − ˆh + i(1 − ˆP ) ˆB − i ˆB+(1 − ˆP )

and, therefore, ﬁnally to (32) because the basis {φα} must be linearly independent.

The implicit equations of motion (42) and (43) are thus completely equivalent to the

explicit expressions (32), (34), used in practical calculations. They allow however a more

transparent interpretation of the present theory:

The use of a ﬁnite basis expansion has the same eﬀect as the introduction of an additional

operator in the hamiltonian. This is similar to the introduction of constraining forces in

classical mechanics, if the dynamics is investigated under boundary conditions. Further, one

can now explicitely see that the “coupled channel” equations (32) and the “constrained”

forces (34), (35) reduce to the standard KS-equations (14) and Newton-equations (15),

respectively (10), if the basis is complete.

E. Energy and momentum balance

As expected, this quantity is conserved for vanishing or time-independent external ﬁelds.

A more transparent expression for the energy balance can be obtained in dipole approx-

From this expression it is clearly seen, that in a homonuclear system (ZA = Z =const.) the

ions will not be excited by the laser, because in the center of mass system the nuclear dipole

moment vanishes, i.e.

In order to obtain more insight into the electronic excitation (deexcitation) process, it is

convenient to consider the total energy change

together with the Fourier-transformed dipole moment

One now immediately realizes that in a continuous wave ﬁeld

In the linear response region this is the case only if ωL coincides with the excitation energy

In the other extreme case of very short laser pulses

For ﬁnite laser pulses, the total electronic energy change can be obtained by solving (57)

numerically, together with the the full equations of motion (32), (34) to calculate the dipole

moment de(t).

We note also, that the present formalism can be favourably used to calculate optically

excited states (i.e. Born-Oppenheimer surfaces) as well as optical excitation spectra in the

and ”numerically short” δ-pulses (61). Details of this procedure will be discussed elsewhere

[37].

In order to investigate the momentum balance we start with the total momentum

Besides the expected dependence on the laser ﬁeld, this balance contains a term that depends

on the exchange-correlation potential Vxc ≡ δAxc/δρ(r, t). This one vanishes for the exact

Vxc, which is a general property of TD-DFT [38]. Without this term one also immediately

realizes, that in dipole approximation the total momentum balance vanishes for neutral

systems, i.e.

which is due to the classical, not quantized treatment of the laser ﬁeld.

We note ﬁnally that the momentum balance (68) can be derived also (and much simpler)

without basis expansion. The derivation, carried out here, therefore proofs nicely the validity

and stresses the importance of the ﬁnite basis correction terms in the forces (34), (35)

following from the variational principle.

III. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have derived in a systematic way a generalized formalism of the NA-QMD which

applies for ﬁnite atomic many-body systems in external ﬁelds.

It is based on a mixed

classical-quantum approach where the electronic system is described by TD-DFT in local

basis expansion and the nuclear degrees of freedom are treated classically by molecular

dynamics. Self-consistent equations of motion are derived from a general action principle.

We have presented here the exact equations of motion. They can be solved without

further approximations for one electron systems, like H+
2

or HD+ [36] where the exact

exchange-correlation term cancels the Hartree-term in the eﬀective potential (16). For many-

electron systems, approximate equations of motion, as derived e.g. in I on a tight-binding

level, can be obtained from the general formalism as well. We intend however, to realize

the numerical implementation of the whole formalism also on the ab-initio level using the

time-dependent optimized potential method [35] for the exchange correlation part in the

action (13). Preliminary results obtained within this method for organic molecules, like

ethylene C2H4, show excellent agreement with CI-calculations [39] concerning the ground-

state properties (i.e. bonding lengths, angles etc.) as well as optical excitation spectra [40].

As a ﬁrst application of the whole time-dependent formalism we intend to investigate the

cis-trans isomerization process of C2H4 in short laser pulses [40].

Another very interesting and fascinating ﬁeld of application concerns the excita-

tion,

ionization and fragmentation mechanism of atomic clusters in intense laser ﬁelds

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Here an all electron treatment together with an appropriate descrip-

tion of the continuum in the ansatz (17) is required which, as discussed in the text, can be

incorporated in the present formalism [37].

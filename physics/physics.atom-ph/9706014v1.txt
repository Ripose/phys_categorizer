Abstract

Recent calculations of the order (Zα)4 m

M Ry pure recoil correction to hydrogen
energy levels are critically revised. The origins of errors made in the previous
works are elucidated. In the framework of a successive approach, we obtain the
new result for the correction to S levels. It amounts to
16.4 kHz in the ground
state and

1.9 kHz in the 2S state.

1 Introduction

The correction to S levels of hydrogen atom, that is ﬁrst-order in m/M and fourth-
order in Zα, has become recently a point of controversy. Initially, this correction was
calculated in Ref.[1]. Then, a diﬀerent result for the same correction was obtained
in Ref.[2]. While in both papers it was employed the same (exact in Zα) starting
expression for the pure recoil correction, the methods of calculation, and in particular
the regularization schemes used were rather diﬀerent. To resolve the discrepancy between
two results, in Ref.[3] an attempt was undertaken to prove the correctness of the earlier
result of Ref.[1] applying the method of calculation used by the present author in Ref.[2].
An extra contribution due to the peculiarities of the regularization procedure was found
by the authors of Ref.[3], which exactly compensated the diﬀerence of the Ref.[2] result
from that of Ref.[1]. This ﬁnding has led the authors of Ref.[3] to conclusion ”that
discrepancies between the diﬀerent results for the correction of order (Zα)6(m/M) to
the energy levels of the hydrogenlike ions are resolved and the correction of this order is
now ﬁrmly established”.

Taking criticism of the Ref.[3] as completely valid, we nevertheless cannot agree with
the conclusion cited above. The point is that the authors of Ref.[3] emphasizing an
importance of an explicit regularization of divergent expressions, pay no attention to an
accurate matching of regularized contributions.

In fact, one usually starts from an exact expression which can be easily checked
to have a ﬁnite value. Then one has to use diﬀerent approximations to handle this
expression at diﬀerent scales. In this way some auxiliary parameter(s) are introduced
which enable one to separate applicability domains for diﬀerent approximations. Finally,
a necessary condition for the sum of thus calculated contributions to be correct is its
independence from any scale separating parameter.

In the present paper we successively pursue this line of reasoning for a recalculation
of the order (Zα)6m2/M correction to hydrogen energy levels. We discuss only S levels
since for higher angular momenta levels the result is actually ﬁrmly established [4, 2].
As far as the controversy mentioned above concerns details of a regularization at the
subatomic scale, the result’s dependence on a principal quantum number n is also known.
That’s why we perform all the calculations for the ground state and then restore the n
dependence in the ﬁnal result.

To make the presentation self-contained we rederive some known results, using some-
times new approaches. In Sec.2 the general outline of the problem is given. Sections 3,
4 and 5 are devoted to the Coulomb, magnetic, and seagull contributions, respectively.
The correspondence between various results is discussed in Conclusion. In Appendixes,
we address a couple of minor computational issues.

Throughout the paper the Coulomb gauge of electromagnetic potentials and rela-
tivistic units ¯h = c = 1 are used. Leaving aside the radiative corrections we set Z = 1

in what follows.

Coulomb ﬁeld is an average value of the non-local operator, [5, 6, 7, 1, 8]

As far as we are going to calculate the correction (1) perturbatively, i.e. as a power

series in α, it proves convenient to decompose (1) into three parts,

sub-contours, thus splitting the Coulomb contribution into two terms,

former term in (6) results from the integration along the upper half of the inﬁnite
circumference and its value is determined by the atomic scale p
mα. Being the
average of the local operator, this term can be easily calculated exactly. The latter term
, 0) in the
in (6) arises as an integral along the contour C−, wrapping the half-axis (
counterclockwise direction. To the order we discuss, this term is completely saturated
by momenta from the relativistic scale p
m. That’s why it can be calculated without
any regularization [1, 2]:

In (25), the order α4 term is just the lowest-order contribution to (10), the order α5
terms are in accord with the result of Salpeter [12], while the order α6 term coincides
with the retardation correction, found in [2],Eq.(14) by the diﬀerent method.

It can be easily seen that the order α6 contribution to the positive-energy part of
(12) is exhausted by the sum of those to (10) and (25). Actually, relativistic corrections
are at least of the α2 relative order. The eﬀect of retardation reveals itself starting from
the α5 order (25). Hence the relativistic corrections to the retardation are at least of
the α7 order.

cally (leading linear divergency vanishes due to the numerator which at k
becomes
transverse to itself, and hence rises only like k, not k2). To treat this divergency we
use the following formal trick [2]: subtract from (27) the same expression with k′2 + λ2
substituted in place of k′2. For λ
mα, the subtracted term is completely determined
by a scale much less than the atomic one, so that we will ﬁnd that term below using a
relativistic approach.

4.2 Short Distances

r
Since in the nonrelativistic approximation the subtracted term,
−, is ultraviolet di-
vergent, we have to calculate it beyond this approximation, i. e. using a relativistic
approach. It proves more convenient in this approach to postpone the integration over
ω to the last stage of calculation. As we will see below, the reversed order of integration

M

6

(ﬁrst over space variables, then over frequency) makes the calculations quite simple. The
fee for the technical advantage is that a regulator contribution is calculated not only for
the negative-, but for the positive-energy part of
also. Surely, the instantaneous
contribution can be left aside, so that only two ﬁrst terms from the r.h.s. of (8) are
considered below.

M

For the subtracted term, we have the new expansion parameter, mα/λ, and hence the
Coulomb interaction during the single magnetic exchange can be treated perturbatively.
The order mα6/M contributions arise due to only two ﬁrst terms of the Green’s function
expansion in the Coulomb interaction, G(0) and G(1). Let us begin with the second
contribution:

We see that as expected the logarithmic in ε term cancels the corresponding one in (31).
The more singular in ε terms can only be the result of the regularization procedure
applied to the positive-energy contribution (25). As far as the latter is non-singular at
short distances, this procedure is actually unnecessary, i. e. it can produce only positive
powers of mα/λ. An explicit calculation can be found in Appendix A.

5 Seagull Contribution

5.1 Long Distances

Again, the best suited way to analyze the atomic scale contribution is to begin from
taking the integral with respect to ω.
It proves that in the order of interest, only
positive-energy intermediate states are to be considered [2]:

A simple power counting shows that only bilinear in ~k and ~k′ term gives rise to the
ultraviolet divergency. To regularize this divergency, we subtract from the divergent
term the regulator contribution, which at large distances equals to

Here 1 appears due to the non-singular operator ~pr−2~p. The ﬁrst term in the curly
brackets represents the regulator contribution to the previous order. In Appendix B, an
appearance of this term as a short-distance contribution to the mα5/M order is shown
explicitly.
In what follows we calculate the subtracted term, whose non-relativistic
version (44) is ultraviolet divergent, in the framework of a relativistic approach.

5.2 Short Distances

Just like in case of the single magnetic exchange, only two ﬁrst terms of the Green’s
function expansion in the Coulomb interaction contribute to the m2α6/M order. For
the G(1)’s contribution we have,

5.3 Total Seagull Contribution

As can be seen from (46), (48), (51), (54), and (59), the total seagull contribution to

6 Conclusions

In complete accord with the result of Ref.[13], the total correction of the m2α6/M order
does not contain ln α. It consists of two terms,

The former term is completely determined by the atomic scale and depends non-trivially
on a principal quantum number n,

As for the latter one, our calculations show that it has its origin at the scale of the order
of m.

The correction (61) shifts the hydrogen ground state by

16.4 kHz and 2S state by
1.9 kHz. These ﬁgures are well comparable with the uncertainties of the recent Lamb

−

−
shift measurements [14].

The result (61) diﬀers from those obtained in Ref.[1, 3] and in Ref.[2]. Let us ﬁrst
discuss the origin of the diﬀerence in the latter case. In [2], it was erroneously assumed
that the cancellation of singular operators at the atomic scale does not leave a non-
vanishing remainder. The present calculation shows that due to a diﬀerence in details
of a cut-oﬀ procedure used to regularize the average values of singular operators, some
ﬁnite contributions do survive the cancellation process.

Unfortunately, the same error was repeated in Ref.[3]. The long-distance contribution
was found there in the framework of some particular regularization scheme. Then it was

11

(60)

(61)

(62)

added to the short-distance contribution calculated in Refs.[1, 2] by completely diﬀerent
regularization procedures. The regularization dependence of the results obtained in [3]
can be seen, for example, in Eq.(29) of Ref.[3], where the integration over k′ being limited
above by a parameter σ′ gives rise to a ﬁnite (depending on σ′/σ) contribution to the
result.

The error made in Ref.[1] is a computational one. It is caused by inaccurate treatment
of the frequency dependence in the integral (42) of Ref.[1] (ironically, by an evident
2)−1 are skipped in
k2
typographical error, just the important factors (ω2
Eq.(42) of Ref.[1]). In what follows we rederive the result of the present work employing
the regularization scheme used by the authors of Ref.[1].

First of all, the result for the long-distance contribution (46) of Ref.[1] (”the third

term”) is in accord with the result of the present work ( 1 in (46)).

∼

As for the remaining contributions, let us begin with one general note.

In their
analysis of the integral (42), the authors of Ref.[1] use the symmetrization in ω, since,
as they wrote, ”generally there are three regions of photon energy ω
α,
and ω
1 that give a contribution and this middle region is almost eliminated by the
symmetrization”. In order not to discuss here whether the middle region is eliminated
or not, we would like to recalculate the contributions of the ﬁrst and the second terms in
(43) of Ref.[1] without the symmetrization in ω. As far as the symmetrization procedure
is no more than a technical trick, a result of calculation should not depend on whether
this procedure is applied or not.

α2, ω

∼

∼

ω

To get the high energy part of the ﬁrst and second term contribution, we put ε′ =
< mǫ from the contour C−. Then the
ε = 0 in (49) and cut oﬀ the low energy end
result for the short-distance (high energy) contribution to the integral (42) of Ref.[1] can
be obtained:

m2α6
M
The sum of the order m2α6/M contributions to Eqs.(51), (54) and (57) of Ref.[1] is two
times smaller. An extra factor one half emerges there due to the symmetrization in ω,
since the contribution of the contour C+, wrapping the half-axis (mǫ,

), vanishes.

Turn now to the low energies. Only the second term of Eq.(43), Ref.[1], contributes
there. According to (42) and (43) of Ref.[1], this contribution (with typos corrected) is,

Here the contour CL goes from

axis. Recall now that the high energy contribution (63) is calculated on the assumption

Extra terms in (41) should be canceled by the regulator counterpart of (13) which
diﬀers from (13) by √k2 + λ2 placed instead of k. Just like in the main text we approx-
imate the sum over positive-energy intermediate states by the nonrelativistic Green’s
function and the matrix element of ~α by ~p/m. Within this approximation, the regulator
contribution is

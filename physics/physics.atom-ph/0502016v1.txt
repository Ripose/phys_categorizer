Abstract

We outline a formalism and develop a computational procedure to treat the process of multi-

photon ionization (MPI) of atomic targets in strong laser ﬁelds. We treat the MPI process nonper-

turbatively as a decay phenomenon by solving a coupled set of the integral Lippmann-Schwinger

equations. As basic building blocks of the theory we use a complete set of ﬁeld-free atomic states,

discrete and continuous. This approach should enable us to provide both the total and diﬀerential

cross-sections of MPI of atoms with one or two electrons. As an illustration, we apply the proposed

procedure to a simple model of MPI from a square well potential and to the hydrogen atom.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the process of multiphoton ionization (MPI) of atomic and molecular

species has been a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies (see reviews

by Protopapas et al. [1], Lambropoulos et al. [2], Chu and Telnov [3] and Posthumus [4]

and references therein). Rapid progress in this ﬁeld has been largely driven by advance-

ment in high-power short-pulse laser techniques. The laser intensities which may go beyond

1013 Wcm−2 make it possible to observe many striking phenomena such as MPI and above-

threshold ionization.

Accurate theoretical description of ionization processes occurring in laser ﬁelds of such

intensities should necessarily go beyond a simple perturbative picture. The ﬁrst nonpertur-

bative theory of MPI was proposed by Keldysh [5], Faisal [6] and Reiss [7]. Their theory

(known as KFR) treated the process of MPI as a transition of an electron from an initial

bound state into a ﬁnal state described by the classical Volkov wave function. The KFR

approach provided simple analytical formulas for the MPI rate which were found in a qual-

itative agreement with experiment. Various modiﬁcations of the KFR theory were made, in

particular those accounting for the rescattering process [8, 9].

The KFR theory treated the laser ﬁeld purely classically. The MPI problem can also

be formulated in an entirely quantum form. The properties of the scattering matrix in

this formulation of the MPI process have been studied starting from the works of Mower

[10, 11], Gontier et al.

[12, 13], Faisal and Moloney [14], Jackson and Swain [15]. More

recently, Guo and Aberg [16] and Guo, Aberg and Crasemann [17] put forward an MPI theory

(referred hereafter as GAC) which treats the photoionization process as a QED scattering

phenomenon. The emphasis in this theory was placed on a proper QED description of an

electron interacting with the laser ﬁeld (the quantum version of the Volkov states). Further

development of the QED picture of the MPI phenomenon was made by Gao et al. [18] and

Chen et al. [19] who reﬁned the original GAC theory by including the non-laser modes of

the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

This fully QED approach, although solving the problem in principle, was found to be

rather diﬃcult to implement in practice even for simplest atomic targets such as one- or two-

2

electron atoms. For instance, Chen et al. [19] had to make further drastic approximations

in order to carry out their calculation of MPI on atomic hydrogen.

One possible solution to this problem is to use some suitable square-integrable basis to

represent the Green functions occuring in the theory. Such approach, using ideas of the

complex rotation method, has been proposed by Maquet et al. [20]. Another solution is to

use the ﬁeld-free atomic states as building blocks of the theory. Such a choice is particularly

advantageous when theory is applied to complex atomic systems with more than one target

electron. Such approach within the context of the complex rotation method has been used

by Mercouris and Nicolaides [21] and Nicolaides and Mercouris [22]. Description of the

quantum mechanical evolution of an atom coupled to a laser ﬁeld is also possible in the

framework of this method [23].

In the present paper, we outline a quantum formalism for MPI which we intend to use

for practical computations on complex atomic systems. The formalism is not entirely new

and is based on the ideas expressed earlier in the literature. The main emphasis of this

work is on the pracical implementation of the formlism and turning it into an eﬃcient

computational procedure. In this development we are inspired by a series of works by Burke

and collaborators who combined the Floquet description of the laser ﬁeld with the R-matrix

scattering theory. Following the seminal work [24], this approach has been successfully

implemented for calculating the total MPI rate and the level shift in atomic hydrogen [25],

helium [26], the negative hydrogen ion [27] and molecular hydrogen [28]. Most recently the

R-matrix Floquet theory was combined with the basis spline technique to describe the two-

electron MPI from the helium atom in the ground [29] and excited states [30]. In addition to

the total MPI rate, some diﬀerential cross-sections can be also calculated within the Floquet

formalism as was demonstrated for atomic hydrogen by Potvliege and Shakeshaft [31] and

Potvliege [32] . It is the most detailed fully diﬀerential cross-sections that are of particular

interest to experimentalists and that we intend to evaluate in our approach.

In the present paper we employ the operator formalism due to Goldberger and Watson

[33]. In this formalism, the MPI process is treated as a decay phenomenon. The partial

decay rates and the energy level shifts are evaluated via the matrix elements of the transition

3

operator which are found by solving a coupled set of the integral Lippmann-Schwinger

equations. In this approach the matrix elements of the transition operator should be taken

between the ﬁeld-free atomic states accompanied by an integer number of the laser photons.

For one-electron targets, evaluation of the ﬁeld-free states is trivial. For two-electron

targets, an accurate set of target states, both discrete and continuous, can be generated by

the so-called convergent close coupling (CCC) method. This method has been extensively

tested for processes with two electrons in the continuum such as electron scattering on atomic

hydrogen [34] and low-ﬁeld double ionization of helium [35, 36]. We intend to use the same

set of target states for MPI of He in the non-perturbative strong-ﬁeld regime.

In our approach we ignore all the processes of spontaneous emission of photons, which is

justiﬁed as we are interested in processes induced by strong ﬁelds. Since the work of Shirley

[37], it is known that if one neglects spontaneous processes in the quantum description of

the interaction of laser light and atom, then the quantum picture and the Floquet method

of solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation become equiavalent. Therefore, the

present approach and the ones based on the Floquet anzats (such as [24], for example) are

completely equivalent. However, recasting the MPI description in the form presented below

may have some practical advantages, especially if we have good means of representing the

ﬁeld-free atomic states for complex atomic systems. This includes, of course, the states

belonging to the continious spectrum. Such means do exist. As mentioned above, the CCC

method turned out to be very eﬃcient at representing ﬁeld-free states of atomic systems.

It was the desire to exploit fully the possibilities provided by CCC technique that largely

motivated us to give a formulation of the MPI process presented below.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we give a formulation of the

MPI theory in terms of the ﬁeld-free atomic states. In Section II A we consider a model

square-well problem, and in Section II B the MPI of hydrogen. We conclude in Section III

by outlining a set of problems we intend to consider in the immediate future.

II. NONPERTURBATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

MPI PROCESS.

Let us consider a system which consists of a number of photons with a given frequency

ω and momentum vector k corresponding to an incident plane-wave, and a target (atom or

ion). We shall describe the ﬁeld fully quantum-mechanically and write the Hamiltonian of

the system as

ˆH = ˆHatom + ˆHﬁeld + ˆHint .

Here ˆHatom and ˆHﬁeld have the usual meaning of the Hamiltonians of the atom and the ﬁeld:

ˆHﬁeld = ˆN ω

The atomic Hamiltonian is taken in a non-relativistic form. The number operator ˆN refers

to the laser photons only..

The corresponding states of the system consisting of the non-interacting atom and the

ﬁeld are denoted as

, where a set of quantum numbers a deﬁnes a state of

the atom and n is the number of the laser photons. The following notations will be kept

throughout the paper: Greek letters will be used to designate the states of a whole system

“the atom plus external ﬁeld”, while the Latin letters will be used for the atomic states.

The atomic system of units is in use with e = m = ¯h = 1.

The part of the Hamiltonian ˆHint which describes the interaction of the atom and the

linearly polarized laser ﬁeld characterized by angular frequency ω, wave-vector k and polar-

ization vector e can be written as (see e.g. Sobelman [38])


where ˆp is the momentum operator and ˆA is a quantized vector potential normalized to the

unit volume:

Here ˆa+ and ˆa have the usual meaning of the operators creating and annihilating a photon.

As mentioned above, we are interested in suﬃciently strong ﬁeld intencities, when all pro-

cesses of spontaneous emission of photons can be neglected. For this reason, only one mode

corresponding to the wavevector of the incident laser ﬁled is kept in Eq. (4). Therefore, here

and below, ˆA describes the laser photons only. We also restrict ourselves with the dipole

approximation in which the operator ˆA does not act on the atomic coordinates.

The matrix elements of the vector potential operator taken between the noninteracting

states of the system “atom plus laser photons” are given by the well-known formulas (see

e.g. Sobelman [38]):

We shall treat the MPI process as a decay phenomenon within the framework of the quantum

|

energy shift ∆Eα of the ﬁnal state is related to the diagonal matrix element of the transition

operator via implicit equation [33]

∆Eα = ReT αα(E)

(10)

The form of the latter equation suggests a possiblity of an iterative scheme for the determi-

nation of the level shift. Equations (8)-(10) provide the basis of our calculation scheme for

evaluating the rates of various multiphoton processes.

In the alternative formalism [31], when the MPI process is treated as a scattering phe-

nomenon, the expression for the T -operator must be corrected for the virtual transitions

between various photodetachment channels. This correction comes from a careful exami-

nation of the boundary conditions which must be imposed on a scattering wave function

in the Floquet representation. In its simplest form, this can be achieved by dividing the

conventional expression for the matrix element of the T -operator by a Bessel function J0

[31]. The problem outlined by Eqs. (8) -(10) is a decay, or an initial state, problem. As

such, it requires an accurate evaluation of the initial state which subsequently decays into

various open channels. Indeed, Eq. (8) is a result of evaluation of the quantum mechani-

cal amplitude

where Ψ(t) evolves from the state

at t = 0 [33]. Therefore no

additional correction to the transition amplitudes (9) is needed.

By introducing in Eq. (9) a complete set of states of ˆH0, this equation can be rewritten

in the form of a spectral representation:

Eα + ∆Eα −

Eγ + iǫ

(11)

Here the sign of iǫ gives the rule of bypassing the pole when performing the integration over

the continuum spectrum.

The shift of the energy of the initial state is explicitely included into the set of Eqs.(11).

This circumstance may be especially important for the atomic systems with more that one

electron. When the escaping electron leaves the atomic system, the remaining ion still

interacts with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the energy shift in the Eqs.(11) takes into account

eﬀects of this interaction.

In Fig. 1 we give a graphical representation of Eq. (11). Here a straight line with an

arrow to the right represents a target atom and the dashed lines are used to depict the

photons. A vertex with two electron lines and one photon line represents a dipole matrix

element (7) which incorporates many-electron correlation in the target. For simplicity we

do not show the quadrupole and monopole matrix elements (11) which are parametrically

small for not very strong ﬁelds F < 1. A rectangular block stands for the T -matrix (11). In

the low-ﬁeld regime the integral term in the right-hand side of (11) can be ignored and the

atomic ionization is described by the bare matrix element

eﬀects are incorporated in the integral term and include multiple absorption and emission

of the laser photons.

The sum over the spectrum of ˆH0 in (11) includes summation over various number of

photons as well as summation over bound atomic states and integration over the continuous

spectrum of the atom. Computation of the integral in (11) can be greatly simpliﬁed by

introducing a discrete set of target pseudostates which provides an adequate quadrature

rule. As the result of such a discretization the set of equations (11) becomes a linear system

on the unknown elements of the T -matrix. Once this linear system is solved, all information

about the integral and diﬀerential features of the MPI process can be obtained from the

matrix elements of the T -operator taken at the energy corresponding to the shifted energy

of the ﬁnal state as in Eq. (8) (the so-called on-shell matrix elements). We note that in the

weak ﬁeld limit summation in (11) can be restricted to the atomic variables and we arrive

to the expression for the dipole matrix element given by Eq. (12) of Kheifets and Bray [35].

A. Square well model

To illustrate feasibility of our approach we ﬁrst apply it to a model problem of an MPI

process from a one-dimensional square well. It is this model system that was considered

by Burke et al. [24] in their seminal paper which gave rise to the spectacular success of

the R-matrix Floquet theory. We consider here an electron bound initially in a square well

potential V =

2.5 a.u. for 0 < x < 1 and V = 0 for x > 1, with the boundary condition

−

−

R(0) = 0 imposed on the wave functions. This potential supports only one bound state a

with an energy E =

0.4657 a.u. We consider an MPI process when the electric ﬁeld with

the frequency ω = 0.2 is applied such that at least three photons are needed to ionize the

system. To solve this problem we follow the steps outlined in Sec. II. The set of equations

(11) is converted into a linear system on the T -matrix elements by choosing a suitable

discretization procedure for the continuous spectrum integration. The summation over a set

of intermediate states γ in the Eq. (11) is a sum over various numbers of photons nγ and

summation and integration over the set of variables specifying the ﬁeld-free electron states.

For the square well model the latter are determined by a single quantum number (momentum

of the states belonging to the continuous spectrum or energy of the discrete spectrum). For a

9

given number of photons in the set of intermediate states γ we ﬁrst determine if there is a pole

in the integral over the continuous spectrum. Similarly to electron scattering calculations

of Bray [34], we divide the momentum integration interval (0,

) into ﬁve subintervals.

∞

If the pole is present in the integral, the ﬁrst two subintervals are chosen to be (0, kpole)

and (kpole, 2kpole) with a typical number of 60 momentum points in each interval. Then the

delta-function singularity is isolated and the remaining principle value integral is evaluated

by a modiﬁed Simpson’s rule [34]. The remaining part of the momentum integral is divided as

follows: (2kpole, 4) (50 integration points), (4, 10) (40 points) and (10, 350) (40 points). These

intervals are pole-free and the integration is performed by using a conventional Simpson’s

rule. If there is no pole in a given channel the integration procedure remains essentially the

same except for the boundary of the ﬁrst and second intervals which is chosen at one atomic

unit of momentum. In this case the conventional Simpson’s rule is used throughout.

We retained various numbers of photons in the intermediate state of Eq. (11). For

simplicity, we count this number from the baseline of three photons in the initial state

which we denote as α =

a, 3

.

In the intermediate and ﬁnal states we can then have

|

i

negative numbers of photons. For example, n =

1 in the ﬁnal state

would mean that

−

γ

|

i

four photons have been absorbed. Using this convention, the calculations we performed can

be denoted as (nmin, nmax) meaning that the number of photons in the intermediate and ﬁnal

states ranges from nmin to nmax.

The problem which arises immediately when one tries to apply Eqs.(11) for the square-

well model is the singularity of the matrix elements ˆH βα

int when both states α, β lie in the

continuum. This is, of course, a consequence of the choice of the gauge of the vector potential

in formulas (3). Fortunately, as we shall show in the section, this problem can be avoided for

real atomic systems by choosing the interaction Hamiltonian in the Kramers-Hennerberger

(acceleration) form. For the square-well potential such choice of the interaction Hamiltonian

is not possible due to the singular character of the potential. We shall have, therefore, to

devise a suitable procedure of the regularization of the matrix elements of operator (3) when

both states belong to continious spectrum. There is vast amount of literature devoted to

the study of such matrix elements for various potentials (e.g.[39, 40, 41]. We dealt with this

10

problem along the lines described in the paper by Mercouris et al. [23]. One can show that

for any potential for which the asymptotic behavior of the continuous wave function is given

by Rk ∝

sin (kr + δ), the following result holds:

P

kf

Here V (ki, kf ) is a regular function and symbol P has a usual meaning of the principal

value integral. Note that this divergence is present only when the velocity form (as in the

present paper) or the length form are used for the electromagnetic interaction operator, it is

absent if the acceleration form is used. Presence of the singularity in the matrix elements in

the velocity and length gauges is a consequence of the use of the spectral representation for

the Green function in (11) and should disappear from the ﬁnal result after the summation

over the whole spectrum is carried out. A convenient way to deal with such integrals is

to introduce a suitable regularization procedure. Diﬀerent procedures of this sort can be

devised. We shall illustrate the use of the two simplest methods.

The ﬁrst regularization scheme consists in computing all the divergent integrals over some

ﬁnite interval (0, D), hoping that ﬁnal results depend only very weakly upon D if its value

is suitably chosen. That this is indeed so can be seen from the results for the level shift

presented in (I). According to Eq. (10), this quantity is related to the real part of the

diagonal matrix element of the T -operator.

To determine the shift we devised a simple iterative procedure, based on the Eq. (10). The

linear system (11) was solved with a trial value ∆Eα = 0, than the value given by the r.h.s

of the Eq. (10) was adopted as a new trial value for ∆Eα, the procedure was repeated untill

convergence was achieved. Typically, three iterations were suﬃcient to achieve convergence

on the level of a fraction of a percent.

The results of a (-4,4) calculation using this strategy are shown in the Table I. The

calculation was performed for diﬀerent values of the cutoﬀ parameter D. As one can see, the

values for the level shift are fairly stable with respect to the variations of the regularization

parameter D. The stability of the results with D becomes somewhat worse for very strong

ﬁelds (F = 0.2 a.u.

in the Table I). This, however, is to be expected as for such strong

ﬁelds the (-4,4) calculation is probably too small and a larger number of photons should

11

be included to obtain more accurate results. Results in the Table I should be compared

with the plot illustrating the level shift as a function of the electric ﬁeld strength from

the time-dependent R-matrix calculation of Burke and Burke [42]. Although the numerical

values are not reported in this paper, a visual comparison of our data with the the plot quite

Another regularization scheme, which we found to give somewhat more stable results for

the ionization rates is based on the regularization formula for a principal value integral:

Again, one can hope that if the regularization is properly implemented, the ﬁnal results do

not depend upon the regularization parameter ǫ. We analyze these results in the form of

the partial ionization rates computed according to Eq. (8). The momentum kf of the ﬁnal

state is determined via the energy of the initial state α, number of photons in the ﬁnal state

nf , and the energy shift ∆E, given by Eq. (10):

The total ionization rate is the sum of the partial rates over all the open channels.

As one can see, the partial rates corresponding to processes with large number of photons

absorbed (four and ﬁve) show certain stability with respect to the number of photons in-

13

cluded in the calculation, which gives us conﬁdence in the results obtained for these partial

rates. One may note, in particular, that for F = 0.1 a.u. the partial rate Γ5 becomes larger

than the rate Γ4.

FIG. 2: Branching ratios of the partial ionization rate to the total rate for various open channels

in the square well model.

The partial contribution of various open channels to the total ionization rate can be

judged from the data presented in the Fig. 2 where we plot the branching ratios for the

channels with various numbers of photons in the ﬁnal state. Again, one can see that for not

very large ﬁeld strengths ( F < 0.05 a.u.) the contributions of the channels with more than

three photons absorbed (labeled n = 4 and n = 5 in the Figure) can be neglected, though

for larger ﬁelds their eﬀect is becoming increasingly important.

Incidentally, one may note, that even (0,3) calculation would not correspond exactly to

the third order perturbation theory. Indeed, solution of the coupled set of equations (11)

amounts eﬀectively to summation of an inﬁnite subset of the perturbation theory terms as

is illustrated in the Fig. 1.

The situation becomes somewhat more complicated for stronger ﬁelds (F > 0.1 a.u.)

where the level shift is so large that the channel closing may occur. A look at the data for

the shift presented in the Table I shows that when F

0.14 a.u. the energy of the initial

≈

bound state α is: E

0.6 a.u. and absorption of the three photons is no longer suﬃcient

≈ −

14

to ionize the system. A more precise value of the ﬁeld for which the channel corresponding

to absorption of the three photons closes is F

0.1435 a.u. as shown by Burke and Burke

≈

[42]. Rich variety of phenomena may occur when ﬁeld approaches this critical value (and

larger ones, corresponding to closing of other channels), in particular ionization rates as

functions of electric ﬁeld intensity may have discontinuities [42].

In the Fig. 3, we plot the total ionization rate as a function of the ﬁeld strength from

the (-4,3) calculation. The same data for the total ionization rate are presented in the Table

IV. In the ﬁgure we make a comparison with the time-dependent R-matrix calculation by

[42] which was found to be almost identical to the earlier Floquet R-matrix results by Burke

et al. [24].

FIG. 3: Total ionization rate as a function of the ﬁeld strength. The solid line shows the present

(-4,3) calculation. Results of the time-dependent R-matrix calculation of Burke and Burke [42] are

shown as points.

Our data show certain trend to deviate from those obtained in Burke and Burke [42]

and Burke et al. [24] for smaller ﬁeld intensities, around F = 0.02 a.u. This deviation

could probably be attributed to diﬃculties of numerical character which are due to the

necessity to manipulate the divergent integrals. These are most diﬃcult to cope with for

smaller ﬁelds when rates are small. This diﬃculties may easily be avoided for ’real world’

problems. For any realistic atomic system, writing the electromagnetic interaction operator

15

in the acceleration form would make all the integrals well-deﬁned and convergent.

We turn now to a more realistic system – the hydrogen atom in the presence of a

monochromatic linearly-polarized laser ﬁeld. As we mentioned above, this system is in some

sense simpler than the model square-well problem, as we can use the Kramers-Hennebeger

form of the interaction Hamiltonian [43, 44], which, as we shall see, allows to avoid all the

problems of divergence of the matrix elements.

If electromagnetic ﬁeld is treated classically, the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian can
be obtained from the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian ˆHmin given by Eqs. (2-3) by means of
a canonical transformation ˆHKH = ei ˆT ˆHmine−i ˆT generated by the operator [44]:

where A is the vector potential and p is the momentum operator.

In the present approach, when electromagnetic ﬁeld is described quantum-mechanically,

we need a quantum analog of the transformation (15). Such transformation is known as

the Pauli-Fierz canonical transformation [45]. For the case of a suﬃciently intense linearly

polarized monochromatic light, when all the processes of spontaneous radiation are neglected

and the quantized vector potential is given by the Eq.(4), with only the laser mode photons

preserved in the expansion, this transformation assumes the form [46]:

In Eqs.(16),(17) primed quantities refer to original (laboratory) frame, and non-primed

Certain amount of care should be taken when physically relevant information is to be
extracted from the transformed Hamiltonian ˆHKH, in particular, when our aim is to study

time-evolution of a quantum system prepared at the moment t = 0 in a given eigenstate

of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian. The Kramers-Henneberger transformation consists, basically,

in transforming the Schrodinger equation into a non-inertial frame moving with electron

oscillating in the ﬁeld (in the quantum version of this transformation this can be seen

from the ﬁrst of Eqs.(16), the quantity on the r.h.s of this equation being essentially an

electric ﬁeld operator). Both the initial and ﬁnal state vectors must then be transformed

17

accordingly [47, 48]. This circumstance may introduce additional complexity in the problem.

Below, we report results on the total ionization rate for multiphoton ionization of hydrogen

atom. One can present the following argument showing that if we are interested in integral

characteristics, such as total ionization rate, one need not transform initial and ﬁnal states.

Indeed, solution of the set of equations (11) with the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian
ˆHKH)−1

(18),(19) is essentially a study of the singular points of the resolvent operator (E

−

(we will be looking, of course, for the points lying on the unphysical sheets of the Riehmann

surface). Total ionization rate from the ground state of hydrogen obtained below from
such a study of the Hamiltonian ˆHKH is in fact related to an imaginary part of one such

Hamiltonian is a singular point of the resolvent operator (E

singular point. On the other hand, total ionization rate obtained using the minimal-coupling
ˆHmin)−1 which is connected
−
ˆHKH)−1 by means of the canonical transformation (16). The

to the resolvent operator (E

−

latter transformation does not change position of singular points, hence, study of singular

points HKH alone (by means of solving set of Eqs.(11)) should give us correct value for the

total ionization rate.

To apply the strategy based on Eqs.(11) to the system described by the Kramers-

Hennebeger Hamiltonian, one should be able to compute the matrix elements of the operator

(19). The procedure which we devised for this purpose is described below.

1. Calculation of matrix elements of ˆHint.

We shall need the following formula for the matrix elements of the operator of the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld, which can be obtained analogously to the Eqs.(5):

In Eq. (20) F is the classical vector of electric ﬁeld strength, a is an arbitrary vector operator

not acting on the photon variables. The correction term to the non-zero matrix element in
Eq. (20) is of the order of n− 1

2 and is negligible in the limit of large intensities which is of

interest to us in the present paper.

2. Numerical Results

We ﬁrst illustrate our procedure of the calculation of the matrix elements of the interaction

Hamiltonian. With the help of the formulas (28) and(29) we calculated the integrals

and angular momenta. We computed integrals for suﬃciently dense grid of energies. As

. In the case of hydrogen atom the atomic states

|

for the range of momenta and a number of photons retained in the calculation, their upper

limits depend on the value of the electric ﬁeld strength. For moderately high ﬁeld strengths

(F

0.1 a.u.) it was suﬃcient to compute integrals with l < lmax = 3 and p < pmax = 7.

≈

The integrals were computed and stored on a disk.

As one can see from the Eq. (28), in the weak ﬁeld limit p = 1 and the interaction Hamil-

tonian in the Kramers-Hennerberger form reduces to the operator

ˆF r
r3ω2 which is commonly
used in the ﬁrst order calculations performed in the acceleration gauge. The parameter

which measures the departure of the matrix element of operator (28) from the ﬁrst order

20

result is the ratio F/ω2. This departure can be quite signiﬁcant. To give an illustration

of the relative role of the higher order corrections in Eq. (28) we present in Table V few

values of the matrix elements

signiﬁcant.

To facilitate comparison with the literature, we performed a series of calculations for the

same set of laser ﬁeld strengths and frequencies as reported by Dorr et al. [27] who used a

combination of the Floquet ansatz and the R-matrix methods. Our results for the level shift

and total ionization rate together with the literature values are summarized in the Table VI.

When presenting their data for the level shifts, Dorr et al. [27] who performed their

calculation in the length gauge subtracted the ponderomotive energy EP = F 2/4ω2 from

the total shift. Since the level shifts in the acceleration and the length gauge are related as

∆EA = ∆EL

−

EP [24] the two sets of data are directly comparable.

We consider ﬁrst the case of the laser ﬁeld with ω = 0.65 a.u. and F = 0.0534 a.u.

As noted by Dorr et al. [27], this is still a perturbative regime. In Eqs.(11) we need not,

therefore, retain very large set of intermediate states γ to achieve convergence.

In the sum over the intermediate states we included the hydrogen atom states with

orbital momentum l = 0, 1 and a set of photonic states with numbers of photons ranging

from nmin =

2 to nmax = 3. Counting the photons we use here the same convention we

−

used in the previous section, when dealing with the square well potential model. We count

the total number of photons in the system from the minimal number of photons needed to

ionize the initial state. Thus, for the angular frequency ω = 0.65 and the ground state of

the hydrogen atom, we have one photon in the initial state. The state with n =

1 will

−

then correspond to the state in which two photons have been absorbed.

As one can see from the Table VI, we achieve quite a good agreement with the data of

Dorr et al. [27], both for the total rate and level shift. For much larger ﬁeld and the same

frequency ω = 0.65 a.u. we need a larger set of intermediate states to be included Eq. (11).

Convergence was achieved when we included the hydrogen atom states with l < lmax = 4

and photonic states with numbers of photons ranging from nmin =

2 to nmax = 3.

−

For the process of genuine multiphoton ionization (ω = 0.184) we also have reasonably

good agreement with the results of the Floquet R-matrix calculation [27]. For the ﬁeld

strength F = 0.0169 we used atomic states with angular momenta l < 4 and photonic states

with nmin =

1 and nmax = 5. This ﬁeld value is still in the perturbative regime.

Truly nonperturbative eﬀects appear for larger ﬁeld strengths. To obtain the values of

the shift and total rate for F = 0.0534 we used atomic states with l < 4 and photonic states

−

−

with nmin =

2 and nmax = 5.

III. CONCLUSION

We developed a non-perturbative formalism which describes the MPI process by a set of

coupled integral equations of the Lippmann-Schwinger type. In contrast to the scattering

22

formalism given in the literature [9, 16, 17, 19], we do not rely on the ﬁeld modiﬁed Volkov

states. Instead, we employ a more convenient set of the ﬁeld-free atomic states which is

particularly advantageous for complex atomic systems with more than one target electron.

This approach, however, can only be realized if one is able to generate a complete set of

discrete target pseudostates providing an accurate quadrature rule. In this respect we rely

on the CCC method which demonstrated its ability to build an eﬃcient pseudostate basis

for one and two electron targets. This gives us conﬁdence that we can implement our

computational scheme for nonperturbative description of MPI in complex atomic systems

such as the helium atom. Thus we should be able to extend a very successful application of

the CCC method to the weak-ﬁled double photoionization to the strong ﬁeld domain.

We demonstrated utility of our approach for a model problem of a square well potential

and a hydrogen atom. Also, we demonstrated that the partial ionization rates, computation

of which is usually the most diﬃcult part of the problem, remain stable with respect to the

number of photons retained in the calculation.

Correlated many-body treatment of Breit interaction with application to cesium
atomic properties and parity violation

Andrei Derevianko

Department of Physics, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada 89557
(Dated: October 30, 2013)

Corrections from Breit interaction to basic properties of atomic 133Cs are determined in the
framework of third-order relativistic many-body perturbation theory. The corrections to energies,
hyperﬁne-structure constants, oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne 6S − 7S amplitude, and electric-dipole matrix
elements are tabulated. It is demonstrated that the Breit corrections to correlations are comparable
to the Breit corrections at the Dirac-Hartree-Fock level. Modiﬁcation of the parity-nonconserving
(PNC) 6S − 7S amplitude due to Breit interaction is also evaluated; the resulting weak charge
of 133Cs shows no signiﬁcant deviation from the prediction of the standard model of elementary
particles. The neutron skin correction to the PNC amplitude is also estimated to be -0.2% with
an error bound of 30% based on the analysis of recent experiments with antiprotonic atoms. The
present work supplements publication [A. Derevianko, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1618 (2000)] with a
discussion of the formalism and provides additional numerical results and updated discussion of
parity violation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The most accurate to date measurement of parity-nonconservation (PNC) [1, 2] in atoms has been carried out
by Wieman and co-workers using 133Cs [3, 4]. The observed weak charge of the nucleus, QW, is determined as a
7S1/2 transition and a theoretical atomic-
combination of the experimental PNC amplitude EPNC of the 6S1/2 −
structure parameter EPNC/QW. Such determined QW provides powerful constraints on possible extensions to the
standard model (SM) of elementary particles. The achieved precision in experiments [3, 4] is 0.35%; however the
required atomic structure parameter has been calculated only with an accuracy of about 1% [5, 6], limiting the
accuracy of determination of the weak charge. Presently it is understood [7, 8, 9] that a detailed account of the Breit
corrections to basic atomic properties is required to reach the next level of precision in ab initio relativistic calculation
7S1/2 PNC amplitude in 133Cs accounts for a
of PNC amplitudes. In particular, the Breit correction to the 6S1/2 −
dominant part of the deviation [4] of determined weak charge from the prediction of the standard model [7, 8, 9].

The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed discussion of the formalism employed in Ref. [7, 10] and to
tabulate additional numerical results. Since the publication of Ref. [7, 10] several calculations of the Breit correction
to properties of cesium atom have been carried out [8, 9, 11] and a comparison between diﬀerent approaches is also
presented here. We also calculate a value for the neutron “skin” correction to the PNC amplitude based on the
analysis of experiments with antiprotonic atoms [12].

The major diﬀerence between the present analysis and earlier works on the Breit interaction in multi-electron
atoms [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] is the systematic treatment of correlation eﬀects, i.e. contributions beyond self-
consistent Breit-Coulomb-Hartree-Fock (BCHF) formulation [14, 17, 18]. These correlation eﬀects are estimated here
in the framework of relativistic many-body perturbation theory. It is demonstrated that these additional contributions
are comparable to the lowest-order BCHF corrections for almost all considered atomic properties.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we describe the employed many-body formalism. Numerical
results are tabulated and discussed in Section III. We consider Breit corrections to energies, hyperﬁne-structure
constants, oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne 6S
7S amplitude, and electric-dipole matrix elements. The Breit correction to
parity non-conserving 6S

7S amplitude is also evaluated in Section IV.

II. METHOD

The Breit interaction [20, 21, 22] is a two-particle interaction caused by an exchange of transverse photons between
atomic electrons. Qualitatively, it describes a magnetic interaction between electrons (so-called Gaunt interaction)

and retardation eﬀect. Its low-frequency form in the Coulomb gauge, employed here, is given by1

where α are Dirac matrices and rij is a distance between electrons. The omitted frequency dependence constitutes
as little as 1-2% of the total Breit correction to the energies for the atomic ground states[17]. The present goal of
ab initio relativistic calculations in Cs is to reach an overall accuracy of 0.1%. Since the Breit corrections to basic
properties of Cs are below 1%, we ignore the frequency dependence in the present analysis. It is worth noting that
a consistent inclusion of the frequency dependence in the Breit interaction would require simultaneous treatment of
QED self-energy correction[18].

Zero–body contribution to the total Hamiltonian H has been discarded since it does not aﬀect the properties of
valence states. It is worth emphasizing that the Breit and Coulomb interactions are of course two-particle operators;
reference to zero-, one-, and two-body parts arises due to the separation into the normal forms of operator products
and is just a matter of convenience.

In the case at hand, the two-particle interaction

T = C + B

is a sum of the instantaneous Coulomb interaction C =
and the Breit interaction B, Eq. (1). Corresponding
i<j
two-particle matrix elements are designated as cijkl and bijkl. The Coulomb interaction dominates and we distinguish
two possibilities in deﬁning the eﬀective potential U in Eq. (5): traditional Coulomb-Hartree-Fock (CHF) potential
U CHF and Breit-Coulomb-Hartree-Fock (BCHF) potential U BCHF, where the Breit and Coulomb interactions are
treated on the same footing. To diﬀerentiate between the two resulting eigensystems of Eq. (5) we will add bar to the
quantities pertaining to the BCHF case, e.g. ¯εi, ¯ai, ¯a†

electron i with core electrons. A set of CHF equations is solved self-consistently for core orbitals; valence wavefunctions
and energies are determined subsequently by “freezing” the core orbitals. The Breit-Coulomb-Hartree-Fock (BCHF)
approximation constitutes introduction of the Breit interaction simultaneously with the Coulomb interaction into the

FIG. 2: Representative second-order contribution to an energy of valence electron.

Of course, ﬁnding a solution of the Shr¨odinger equation even with the traditional many-body Coulomb Hamiltonian,
Eq. (10), is a nontrivial problem. Many-body perturbation theory [26] has proven to be very successful in treating
contributions beyond the Hartree-Fock level. In particular, ab initio relativistic many-body calculations for alkali-
metal atoms have been performed by Notre Dame and Novosibirsk (Sydney) groups. These and other calculations
have been reviewed recently in Ref. [27]. An accurate description of the correlations (i.e. contributions beyond
Hartree-Fock value) plays a crucial role in high-precision calculations. One of the most striking examples of the
importance of correlations in 133Cs is the magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne-structure (HFS) constant A of 5D5/2 level. Here
the Coulomb-Hartree-Fock value, +7.47 MHz, has a sign opposite to that of experimental value -21.24(5) MHz from
Ref. [28]. The dominant correlation corrections to matrix elements arise because of core-shielding of externally
applied ﬁelds (e.g. nuclear ﬁelds for HFS constants) and an additional attraction of a valence electron by an induced
dipole moment of the core [29]. The former eﬀect is described by contributions beginning at second order (random-
phase approximation (RPA)) and the latter in third order (Brueckner corrections) of many-body perturbation theory.
Representative many-body diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. Qualitatively, the Breit correction to a certain Coulomb
diagram is proportional to the value of the Coulomb diagram. Therefore, in addition to lowest-order corrections we
consider the Breit contributions to the dominant RPA and Brueckner diagrams. It will be demonstrated that these
correlated Breit corrections in many cases are comparable to the lowest-order ones. In the BCHF basis the correlated
Breit correction to valence energies appears in the second-order; a sample diagram is drawn in Fig. 2. The corrections
to this class of diagrams is comparable to the modiﬁcation at the Hartree-Fock level.

In the present work we employ many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Explicit expressions for contributions to
matrix elements up to the third order were tabulated by Blundell et al. [30]. These authors provide formulas for
a general perturbing potential with one– and two–body parts. In the second and third orders there are 31 distinct
diagrams involving one-body part of the perturbation and 28 diagrams containing only two-body part. Certainly
calculations of the Breit corrections are less complicated in the Breit-Coulomb-Hartree-Fock basis, where the one-
body perturbation is absent. Another advantage of the BCHF basis is an automatic inclusion of important relaxation
eﬀect discussed below. An adequate account for the relaxation eﬀect correction in the CHF basis would have required
ﬁfth-order calculations for matrix elements.

The generalization of MBPT expressions to a simultaneous treatment of Coulomb and Breit interactions is straight-
forward: Coulomb interaction lines are replaced by a sum of Coulomb and Breit interactions and particle (hole) lines
by Breit-Coulomb-Hartree-Fock states (see Figs. 1 and 2.) Together with the corrections linear in the Breit interaction
such approach introduces terms nonlinear in the Breit interaction. Strictly speaking these nonlinear terms have no
meaningful theoretical basis and therefore have to be omitted. However, the Breit contribution to atomic properties
is relatively small and the much smaller terms nonlinear in the Breit interactions can be neglected at the present level
of accuracy.

In Fig. 3 we present a comparison of the lowest-order one-body Breit corrections to valence energies, hyperﬁne-

order, Eq. (13), and Hartree-Fock corrections, Eq. (14), respectively. There is a striking discrepancy between the two
corrections for all these quantities. For example, the ﬁrst-order correction to the 6s HFS constant is -0.4%, while at
the Hartree-Fock level the Breit correction almost vanishes.

These large discrepancies are explained by a “relaxation” eﬀect, i.e. modiﬁcation of the Hartree-Fock potential

through adjustment of core orbitals [18]. To illustrate this eﬀect we rewrite the BCHF equation, Eq. (9), as

Here the ﬁrst term is an explicit Breit contribution, while in the second and the third terms the Breit interaction
enters implicitly through corrections to core orbitals. Only the ﬁrst term (and its exchange form) are included in the
ﬁrst-order correction, Eq. (13). As demonstrated by Lindroth et al. [18] for Breit corrections to the energy levels of
Hg, the residual “relaxation” terms are large and substantially modify the ﬁrst-order corrections. Similar observation
has been made by Johnson et al. [31] in calculations of Breit corrections to energies of sodium-like ions. Independent
to the present analysis ( partially published in Ref. [7]) the relaxation eﬀect in Cs has been recently discussed by
Kozlov et al. [32].

At this point it is clear that the inclusion of Breit interaction in the Coulomb-Hartree-Fock equations (i) greatly
simpliﬁes many-body perturbation expansions, and (ii) automatically accounts for the signiﬁcant relaxation eﬀects.
In other words, compared to the traditional Coulomb-Hartree-Fock formulation, the transformation to the Breit-CHF
basis sums many-body diagrams involving the eﬀective one-body Breit interaction to all orders of perturbation theory.

C. Construction of Breit-Coulomb Hartree-Fock basis

Several methods can be devised for constructing the Breit-CHF single-particle basis. For example, one can determine
the Breit corrections to wavefunctions by substituting Eq. (17) into Eq. (16). It is convenient to express the resulting
equations in terms of expansion coeﬃcients ξij =

Here ˜tijkl is an anti-symmetrized two-particle matrix element ˜tijkl = tijkl −
tijlk. Once the equations (18) are solved
′
the “Breit-dressed basis” can be determined as ¯φj = φj +
i ξij φi. The derived equations are essentially equivalent
to the random-phase approximation or the self-consistent-ﬁeld method, with an eﬀective one-body Breit interaction
serving as an external perturbation. The many-body diagrams for the amplitudes ξij are shown in Fig. 4. By iterating
these equations one sums a certain class of many-body diagrams to all orders in the Coulomb interaction.

P

The resulting equations (18) are linear in the Breit interaction.

It is worth noting that the Breit interaction,
Eq. (1), is an approximation and terms nonlinear in the Breit interaction have no meaningful theoretical basis.
Therefore linearized equations (18) are conceptually more attractive than the self-consistent BCHF method based
on an integration of Eq. (9). However, the Breit contribution to atomic properties is relatively small and the much
smaller terms nonlinear in the Breit interactions can be safely neglected at the present level of accuracy.

An alternative approach to generating the BCHF basis set has proven to be more numerically robust and was

body diagrams are presented in Fig. 2 and 1. Contributions of negative-energy states, discussed for example in Ref. [24],
were also included and found to be relatively small [10]. Two series of third-order calculations were performed, ﬁrst
with the Breit and Coulomb interactions fully included using the Breit-CHF basis set, and second in the CHF basis set
without the Breit interaction and negative-energy states. The obtained diﬀerences are the Breit corrections analyzed
in the following sections.

Numerical calculations were performed using B-spline basis sets generated in a cavity of radius 75 a.u. This cavity
size has been chosen for numerical consistency with the previous determination of parity-nonconserving amplitudes
by Blundell et al. [5]. The numerical quasi-spectrum was represented by 100 negative- and 100 positive-energy states
for each angular quantum number κ. The intermediate-state summations were performed over 75 lowest-energy
positive-energy states and 75 highest-energy negative-energy states for each partial wave s1/2 −

h11/2.

III. ATOMIC PROPERTIES

A. Energies of valence states.

At the Hartree-Fock level, the Breit interaction contributes less than 0.1% to all the energy levels considered in
Fig. 3. Numerical values for Breit correction at the Hartree-Fock level are given in Table I; these were obtained as
εv. As in the traditional
diﬀerences between one-particle energies in Breit-CHF and CHF approximations, i.e. ¯εv −
CHF calculations, the ﬁrst-order many-body contributions to valence energies vanish identically in the BCHF basis. In
the second order the corrections arise due to self-energy diagrams. For each valence state we perform two calculations
with and without the Breit interaction and take a diﬀerence between the two values. Further, we distinguish between
two classes of Breit modiﬁcations, one-body and two-body corrections, as illustrated for a diagram in Fig. 5. The one-
body contribution arises from a transformation of the one-particle basis from Coulomb-Hartree-Fock to Breit-CHF.
The calculated values and breakdown on various contributions are presented in Table I. Apparently the Breit
correction to the correlation part of the energy, δEBO, is equally important as the modiﬁcation in the lowest order,
δEHF. The interplay of Breit corrections to various many-body diagrams for the energy of the 7S1/2 state is remarkable.
Here the two terms δEHF and δEBO, B(1) are almost equal and have opposite signs, the resulting modiﬁcation being
determined by relatively smaller two-body Breit correction δEBO, B(2). From Table I we see that generally the two-
body Breit contributions are smaller than the one-body corrections; the B(2) corrections become important when the
cancellations are involved.

The ﬁrst study of correlated Breit corrections to the energies of Cs and other alkali-metal atoms has been performed
in Ref. [33, 34]. Based on formalism developed in Ref. [35], the corrections have been determined as an expectation

eﬀective two-body interaction B(2) has been neglected.

Comparison of our results with the CCSD values and results of Ref. [9] is presented in Table II. The best agreement is
for P1/2 states where there is no cancellation between corrections δEHF and δEBO, B(1). The values diﬀer signiﬁcantly
for S1/2 states where strong cancellations, emphasizing higher orders of MBPT, are present. One should keep in mind
that these discrepancies arise only when the Breit corrections, due to cancellation eﬀects, are small and do not have an
enhanced eﬀect on evaluation of parity non-conserving amplitudes, discussed in Section IV. Calculations [9] are less
consistent with the present and CCSD results, with discrepancies caused by approximation of full Breit interaction
by Gaunt term and neglect of two-body part of the Breit interaction.

B. Magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne structure constants

To reiterate discussion in Section II, we performed two series of computations: (i) traditional Coulomb and (ii) fully
including Breit interaction. The diﬀerence between resulting values deﬁnes the Breit correction. From parametrical
argument it is assumed that the leading Breit corrections arise from induced modiﬁcations of the dominant traditional
Coulomb diagrams. Therefore the calculations were limited to the random-phase-approximation (RPA) and Brueckner
diagrams (see Fig. 1). Further the RPA sequence was truncated at the third order.

In calculations of Breit corrections to 133Cs hyperﬁne-structure magnetic-dipole (HFS) constants A nucleus was
modelled by a uniformly magnetized ball of radius Rm = 5.6748 fm. The gyromagnetic ratio for 133Cs nucleus is
gI = 0.73789 [36].

The breakdown of Breit corrections to various classes of many-body diagrams is given in Table III. Clearly the

There is a cancellation of various contributions to the HFS constants of P1/2 and P3/2 states. For these states the
contribution of higher-order diagrams not included in the present third-order analysis can become enhanced. At the
same the total Breit corrections to A6S and A7S are expected to be insensitive to higher-order contributions.

A comparison of our results, partially published in Ref. [7], with other calculations is presented in Table IV. The
correction to hyperﬁne constants is very sensitive to correlations: e.g., Ref. [37] found a numerically insigniﬁcant
modiﬁcation for A6S, while Ref. [10, 33] determined the modiﬁcation to be large (-4.64 MHz), and the approach
reported here yields +4.87 MHz.
In the calculation of Ref. [37] the correction was determined as a diﬀerence of
the Breit-CHF and CHF values, however such approach misses two-body Breit corrections of comparable size. In
Ref. [10, 33] a second order perturbation analysis was used for the Breit interaction, but the important relaxation
eﬀect discussed earlier was omitted. The present calculation incorporates all mentioned diagrams and is also extended
to third order. Motivated by strong dependence of results [7, 33, 37] on many-body corrections, Sushkov [11] derived
an analytical expression for Breit correction to HFS constants of S states. His results for 6S and 7S states are in
an excellent agreement with the present calculations. Kozlov et al. [9] used an approach similar to Ref. [7]. There
is a cancellation of various contributions for the P states; both higher-order diagrams and an approximation of the
full Breit interaction by the Gaunt term in Ref. [9] are the sources of discrepancies between our results for 6P1/2 and
7P1/2 states.

Hyperﬁne structure constants sample atomic wavefunctions close to the nucleus and provide a unique way of testing
atomic-structure calculations of parity-nonconserving amplitudes. In Table V we combine the Breit corrections with
the results of ab initio all-order Coulomb-correlated calculations [37] and compare the results with experimental
values. It is clear that the Breit corrections uniformly improve the agreement. In particular, the theoretical HFS
constants are improved to 0.1% for 6S1/2, 7S1/2, and 7P1/2 states except for 6P1/2 where the discrepancy becomes
0.5%. While the achieved agreement in Table V is encouraging, one should keep in mind omitted QED corrections and
higher-order contributions in Coulomb interaction. For example, an estimate [38, 39] for hydrogen-like Cs ion results
in a QED correction to HFS constant A of S-states at a few 0.1%. Due to electron-electron interaction in atomic Cs
QED corrections can be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed. Correlated calculations of QED corrections would be beneﬁcial for
reaching 0.1% level of accuracy needed for interpretation of parity-nonconservation and also for understanding the
role of high-order Coulomb diagrams at 0.1% precision.

C. Oﬀ-diagonal 6S − 7S hyperﬁne-structure matrix element

Experiments [3] on parity-nonconservation (PNC) in 133Cs determine the ratio of 6S

7S PNC amplitude EPNC to
vector transition polarizability β. The value of β is diﬃcult to calculate reliably since it vanishes in the nonrelativistic
limit. Following suggestion [40], Bennett and Wieman [4] determined a supporting ratio of β to oﬀ-diagonal magnetic-
dipole matrix element Mhf with a precision of 0.16%. Such an approach eliminates β from the analysis, but requires
an accurate value for Mhf .

−

The quantity Mhf can be expressed in terms of the oﬀ-diagonal magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne structure constant A6S−7S.

This constant can be well approximated by a semiempirical geometric-mean formula [41]

As.e.
6S−7S ≈ p

A6SA7S ,

where A6S and A7S are precise experimental hyperﬁne structure constants. The accuracy of this expression was
investigated in Ref. [42, 43, 44]. Most recently, Dzuba and Flambaum [44] employed several many-body techniques
of increasing accuracy in the Coulomb interaction between electrons and found that this geometric-mean formula is
accurate to a fraction of 10−3. Here we extend their analysis and rigorously consider the additional eﬀect of the
correlated Breit interaction. The Breit correction to hyperﬁne-structure constants A6S and A7S is in the order of
0.2% and it can aﬀect the sub-0.1% accuracy of the Coulomb analysis [44].

Breit corrections are relatively small. If Eq. (21) holds, the following relation between the Breit corrections (δA)

has to be satisﬁed

As a result of the correlated Breit calculations we ﬁnd δA6S−7S = 2.4 MHz. With A6S−7S = 1120.1 MHz, the ratio

10−3. Using the Breit corrections to HFS constants A6S and A7S from Table III, the semiempirical

10−3. Clearly the accuracy of the geometric-mean formula (21) is not aﬀected
r.h.s. of the above equation is also 2.1
by the Breit correction. Qualitatively this can be explained by a close proportionality of 6S and 7S wavefunctions in
the vicinity of the nucleus, where the main contribution to the HFS constants of S states is accumulated.

D. Electric-dipole transition amplitudes

Calculated Breit corrections to reduced electric-dipole matrix elements of various transitions in Cs are presented
in Table VI. We note that the Breit corrections to the random-phase approximation diagrams are small compared to
the lowest-order and Brueckner-orbital corrections. Generally the total corrections are rather small (
0.1%), with an
7P1/2 electric-dipole matrix element. Using the ab initio all-order Coulomb-correlated value by

is determined as an average, with the partial Breit contribution removed from the value of Ref. [5]. The major

where GF is the Fermi constant, γ5 is the Dirac matrix, and ρnuc(r) is the neutron density distribution. To be
consistent with the previous calculations the ρnuc(r) is taken to be a proton Fermi distribution employed in Ref. [5].
The slight diﬀerence between the neutron and proton distributions will be addressed in the conclusion of this section.
The dominant contribution to the PNC-amplitude, Eq. (23), comes from intermediate states 6P1/2 and 7P1/2. In
Table VII we present calculated third-order Breit corrections to the relevant matrix elements of weak interaction.
Apparently, the dominant part of the Breit correction arises from modiﬁcations at the Hartree-Fock level and in
random-phase approximation (PRA). All the corrections add coherently, and we do not expect that omitted higher-
order diagrams to be important. In fact, third-order RPA corrections are a few times smaller than those in the second
order, hinting at a good convergence of the present technique.

The Breit correction to the PNC amplitude is determined by combining induced modiﬁcations in matrix elements
and energy denominators. The required corrections are summarized in Table VIII. The tabulated dipole amplitudes
are related to the reduced matrix elements in Table VI as

Before proceeding to the correlated calculations, it is worth examining the Breit contribution to the PNC amplitude
at the Hartree-Fock level. Most of the Breit contribution to the PNC amplitude can be determined by limiting the
summation over intermediate states in Eq. (23) to the two lowest valence P1/2 states: 6P1/2 and 7P1/2.
In the
CHF approximation one then ﬁnds EPNC =
0.6888 (90% of the total value). The lowest-order corrections to
matrix elements and energy denominators calculated as diﬀerences between Breit-CHF and CHF values are listed in
Table VIII. The resultant BCHF corrections to EPNC are:

Here the percentage values in parentheses are taken with respect to the DHF value of PNC amplitude. The sum
of these three terms leads to δEPNC = 0.0023. Inclusion of intermediate states beyond 6P1/2 and 7P1/2 leads to a
small additional modiﬁcation to δEPNC of -0.00004. The obtained lowest-order result is in agreement with the 0.002
correction found by Blundell et al. [5]. In addition to the lowest-order the Breit correction in Ref. [5] also contained
small random-phase-approximation diagrams in the Coulomb interaction for matrix elements of the weak interaction.
The two-body Breit interaction has been disregarded in Ref. [5]. In the following discussion we will include these
omitted eﬀects. Note that if experimental energies (which eﬀectively include the Breit interaction) are used in the
energy denominators of Eq. (23), then the EPNC(δE) term must be excluded and the total correction becomes twice
as large: δEPNC = 0.0042.

With further examination of the modiﬁcations of individual uncorrelated matrix elements summarized in Table VIII,

one notices the following.
(i) Weak interaction matrix elements are each reduced in absolute value by 0.3%, which is directly reﬂected in a 0.3%
correction to the PNC amplitude.
(ii) Modiﬁcation of dipole amplitudes is strongly nonuniform. There are substantial corrections only to the

It is well known that correlations caused by residual Coulomb interactions not included in the Hartree-Fock
equations can lead to substantial modiﬁcations of the lowest-order values. For example, the weak matrix element

is increased by a factor of 1.8 by correlations due to residual Coulomb interactions. As demonstrated
6S1/2|
h
in the previous sections, correlations are also important for a proper description of the Breit corrections. Examination
of the third-order corrections listed in Table VIII reveals that the corrections to weak interaction matrix elements
become three times larger than those in the lowest order. Using third-order matrix elements and second-order energies
the following ab initio corrections are determined:

EPNC(δHW) = 0.0043 ,
EPNC(δD) = 0.0035 ,
EPNC(δE) =

0.0028 .

−

Thus the lowest-order corrections given in Eq. (28) are ampliﬁed in higher orders. The calculated Breit corrections
to the PNC amplitude is expected to be insensitive to the omitted higher-order diagrams. Such uncertainty can
arise if the calculated Breit corrections to leading classes of many-body diagrams cancel. Indeed, the calculated Breit
corrections always add coherently for matrix elements of weak interaction. There are also no strong cancellations
between various Breit corrections to the relevant dipole amplitudes
(see Table VI). Corrections
to energy denominators are also stable with respect to the omitted higher-order contributions. For example, in
Section III A we found that the Breit correction to the energy of 7S1/2 valence state due to cancellations of calculated
contributions is small (-0.26 cm−1) enhancing possible eﬀect of smaller higher-order corrections. However, in the
calculation of the term EPNC(δE) this (unstable) correction substantially appears only in a combination with a 25
times larger and stable Breit correction (7.1 cm−1) to the energy of 6P1/2 state.

We further improve the accuracy of the calculation by combining all-order Coulomb-correlated matrix elements and
experimental energy denominators tabulated in Ref. [5] with the present third-order Breit corrections. The results
are:

most likely due to the omission of the retarded part of the Breit interaction in the calculations [9].

−

If the experimental energies (which incorporate Breit corrections by deﬁnition) are used in the energy denominators
the term EPNC(δE) should be excluded and the semiempirical Breit correction becomes δEB,s.e.
PNC = 0.0084. A minor
diﬀerence of our treatment [7] of the Breit correction to EPNC and Ref. [8, 9] is the interpretation of results of previous
Coulomb-correlated calculations [5, 6]. Authors [8, 9] assert that the ab initio 0.6% correction ( 0.4% in Ref. [9] )
should be used to augment EC
PNC, Eq. 24. Our approach is to exclude term EPNC(δE). The diﬀerence in the two
interpretations arises due to the diﬃculty of accounting for higher order Coulomb diagrams. Some semiempirical
“ﬁtting” or “scaling” procedure is used in practice to mimic the eﬀect of the omitted contributions. Since only
energies are known with a very high precision from experiments, experimental energies play a central role in such
analysis. For example, the experimental energies were employed in eight out of ten test cases in the scatter analysis
in the Table IV of Ref. [5] (Phys. Rev. D) based on Eq. (23).

The above discussion demonstrates some arbitrariness encountered in the analysis of theoretical values and assign-
ment of theoretical uncertainty when a semiempirical adjustment of ab initio values is attempted. We notice that
authors of Ref. [8, 9] argue that the theoretical uncertainty of the PNC amplitude is in the order of 1%, therefore a
0.3% diﬀerence between the two diﬀerent interpretations of the Breit correction is irrelevant at this level. We believe
that the most convincing error estimate would be a repetition of the scatter analysis originally performed in Ref. [5]
but with a Breit correction to the involved quantities included. Such calculation is beyond the scope of the present
work. However, we expect that the resulting uncertainty would be better than the original 1% assigned to the re-
sults [5, 6] because of the better theory-experiment agreement for dipole amplitudes (see [4]) and hyperﬁne-structure
constants (see Table V). Additional QED and especially neutron skin eﬀects can further modify the value of EPNC
in a way that cannot be mimicked by the suggested analysis.

The parity violation in atoms is dominated by the Z-boson exchange between atomic electrons and neutrons.
However the reference value EC
PNC, Eq. (24), is based on the empirically deduced proton distribution. The diﬀerence
between the proton and neutron distributions is visualized as the neutron “skin” or “halo”. Here we update our
previous treatment of the neutron skin correction with the most recent data from the literature. This correction was
estimated in Ref. [5] but was not included in the ﬁnal value for the PNC amplitude. It can be shown that the neutron
skin correction δEn.s.

PNC does not depend on the electronic structure, therefore it can be parameterized as

Here Rp is the root-mean-square (rms) radius of proton distribution and ∆Rnp is the diﬀerence between rms radii
of neutron and proton distributions. This expression can be easily derived from analysis by Fortson et al. [48].
From nonrelativistic nuclear-structure calculations Pollock and Welliver [49] concluded ∆Rnp/Rp = 0.016 or 0.022
depending on the model of nuclear forces. The calculations [50, 51] of nuclear distributions were relativistic and
the corrections as twice as large ∆Rnp/Rp = 0.043
0.053 were found. Therefore nonrelativistic calculations led
to δEn.s.
PNC/EPNC of -0.1% and relativistic determinations to -0.3 – -0.4%. The latter values are comparable to the
experimental error bar of the PNC amplitude [3, 4] and unfortunately it is diﬃcult to assess the accuracy of the
nuclear-structure calculations.

Here we propose an alternative analysis of the neutron skin correction allowing to estimate the error bar. Indeed
Trzcinska et al. [12] very recently deduced neutron density distributions from experiments with antiprotonic atoms
and concluded that

Here N and A are the neutron and the mass numbers. Although experimental data for 133Cs do not enter the
analysis[12], a wide range of stable nuclei was investigated. Assuming that this relation holds for 133Cs we ﬁnd
∆Rnp = 0.13(4) fm. For 133Cs Rp = 4.807 fm [52] leading to

δEn.s.

Therefore the neutron skin corrects the PNC amplitude by -0.2% with an error bar of 30%. This uncertainty con-
tributes only 0.06% to an error budget of the observed weak charge, i.e. the proposed determination of the neutron
skin correction will be adequate until the 0.1% level of overall accuracy is reached.

Combining the calculated semiempirical 0.9% Breit correction with the reference Coulomb-correlated value, Eq.(24),

and the neutron skin correction, Eq.(32), one obtains the parity-nonconserving amplitude

In section III C we concluded that the result for the oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne structure matrix element Mhf by Dzuba

uncertainty to the theoretical PNC amplitude, Eq. (33). The deviation stands at 1.3σ if 0.4% theoretical uncertainty
is assumed as discussed by Bennett and Wieman [4]. Following Ref. [7], similar conclusion has been reached in
Ref. [8, 9].

V. CONCLUSION

15

In this work we presented a relativistic many-body formalism for treating correction from the Breit interaction.
Numerical evaluation of the Breit corrections to a number of properties of cesium atom were carried out. In particular
we considered energies, hyperﬁne-structure constants, electric-dipole transition amplitudes and 6S
7S parity violating
amplitude. We demonstrated that the Breit corrections to correlations are as important as the modiﬁcations at the
lowest-order Dirac-Hartree-Fock level. This work supplements Ref. [7] with additional numerical results. The present
treatment has been based on third-order relativistic many-body perturbation theory.
In a few cases we observed
intricate cancellations between the lowest-order and higher-order corrections. These are the counterintuitive cases
where the most advanced methods of many-body perturbation theory originally developed for residual Coulomb
interaction will have to be employed to obtain an adequate description of a small Breit correction.

Is it possible to test the accuracy of the theoretical treatment of the Breit contribution for alkali-metal structure?
n′S1/2. A second-order
One could consider the nonrelativistically forbidden magnetic-dipole transitions nS1/2 −
analysis [24] demonstrated exceptionally large contributions from the Breit interaction and negative-energy states for
such transitions; more accurate all-order calculations would be desirable. At the same time an accurate experimental
value for the 7S

6S transition in Cs is available [4].

We determined Breit correction to parity non-conserving (PNC) amplitude of the 6S

7S transition. The calculated
correction resolves most of the discrepancy [4] between the standard model prediction and atomic PNC determination
of the 133Cs weak charge.

−

−

Breit correction to the PNC amplitude is one of the smaller contributions which needed to be addressed in order
to reach the next level of accuracy in ab initio calculations required for reﬁned interpretation of parity violation.
In this work we also evaluated and constrained the neutron “skin” correction. As discussed in Ref. [8, 9, 11], the
remaining corrections which can contribute at a few 0.1% are due to higher-order many-body diagrams in the Coulomb
interaction and QED corrections.

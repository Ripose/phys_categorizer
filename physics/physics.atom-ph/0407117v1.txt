This work presents a ﬁrst time accurate calculation of the magnetic dipole hyperﬁne structure
constants for the ground state and some low-lying excited states of Pb+. By comparing diﬀerent
levels of approximation with experimental results, we demonstrate the importance of correlation
eﬀects which reach beyond lower order relativistic many body perturbation theory. Employing
relativistic coupled-cluster theory we obtain a quantitative understanding of the core-polarization
and correlation eﬀects inherent in this system and observe completely diﬀerent trends compared to
Ba+.

Coupled-cluster
theory has been used to study a
wide range of many-body systems[1]. Although the
non-relativistic version of this theory has been very
light atoms and
successfully applied to a variety of
molecules[2],
its extension to the relativistic regime
is rather recent[3, 4]. There have been relatively few
theoretical studies of properties of heavy atomic systems
based on the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory.
Pb+(Z=82) is the heaviest atomic ion that has been
trapped and cooled so far[5, 6]. The magnetic dipole
hyperﬁne constants have been measured for the 6p2P1/2
and 6p2P3/2 states of this ion[7] and these data can
be compared with calculations of the corresponding
quantities using RCC theory. Such comparisons would
indeed constitute an important test of this theory. The
non-linear RCC in the singles and doubles approxima-
tion with partial triples added in some cases has yielded
results to an accuracy of about one percent for atoms
and ions with a single s valence electron [8, 9, 10].
However, the correlation eﬀects in Pb+ are expected to
be much stronger as it has a 6p valence electron and two
6s electrons in its outermost core orbital.

The hyperﬁne structure constant (A)for the atomic state
|JM i can be expressed in terms of a reduced expectation
value

with µN being the nuclear magnetic moment and [ µI
I ]
the Lande’s nuclear g-factor (gI ). T (1) can be written as

T (1) = X

j αj · Y(q)

10

(0.2)

where rj is the radial position of the jth electron, αj is
the Dirac matrix and Y(q)
10 is a vector spherical harmonic.

We have used the RCC theory in to obtain the atomic
wavefunctions. As pointed out in our earlier work [12]
coupled-cluster theory is equivalent to all order many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT). In the open-shell
coupled-cluster theory [13, 14] the many-body wavefunc-
tion for a system with single valence electron can be writ-
ten as

|Ψvi = eT {1 + Sv}a†

v|Φ0i ,

(0.3)

where a†
v is the creation operator corresponding to a
valence orbital ’v’ and |Φ0i is a closed-shell determinan-
tal state built from occupied Dirac-Fock (DF) orbitals.
T- and Sv- are the closed and open shell excitation
operators respectively.
In this work both T- and Sv-
operators are truncated beyond double excitations and
triple excitations are added on the leading order MBPT
level.

The above expression was applied to compute the

The orbitals used in the present work were constructed
as linear combinations of Gaussian type orbitals(GTOs)

ticle states for closed-shell P b++. The virtual V N −1 or-
bitals [17, 18] were constructed from the closed-shell po-
tential of P b++ using the same Fock operator. All or-
bitals were generated on a grid using a two-parameter
Fermi nuclear distribution approximation given by

It is interesting to note that the DF values for these
two states deviate from their respective experimental
values in opposite directions, so that the sign of the
correlation contributions are opposite for the two cases.
This is further supported by the results based on
second order relativistic many-body perturbation theory
(RMBPT(2)) which are given in table III. Here the

FIG. 2: The ratios of pair-correlation and core-polarization
eﬀects w.r.t. the DF values

dominant contributions to RMBPT(2) as shown in Fig.
are given explicitly. While electron correlation at this
level is substantial for all the states, it is dramatic in
the case of 6p3/2 state because of the unusually large
and negative core-polarization. In table IV we give the
signiﬁcant contributions to the core polarization which
arises from the interaction of the outermost core 6s and
the valence 6p3/2 electrons (third column). The sum of
these individual contributions is -971.5 MHz and after
taking into account the polarization of all the other core
electrons, a net contribution of -814.6 MHz is obtained.
The tremendous size of this second-order correction
suggests that an all order method like coupled-cluster
theory is necessary for a correct quantitative description
of the correlation eﬀects in P b+. This is indeed reﬂected
in the results given in table V. Again, the ’bare’ operator
O represents the DF approximation, i.e. excluding any
correlation eﬀects. Several important correlation con-
tributions for our RCC calculations are also presented
in table V. ¯O = eT †
OeT denotes the ’dressed’ operator
containing the contributions of the closed-shell cluster
amplitudes in Eq. (0.6). Although core-polarization
(OS2v) and pair correlation (OS1v) are the dominant
correlation eﬀects, core correlation eﬀects ( ¯O − O) are by
no means negligible; they amount to about 9% for the 7s
state. Summing up all the contributions given in table
V leads to signiﬁcant improvements in our calculated
values of the hyperﬁne constants of the 6p1/2 and 6p3/2
states. The sub one percent (0.7%) agreement between
the former and experiment is indeed spectacular. A
similar agreement cannot be expected for the latter state
which is characterised by extremely peculiar correlation
eﬀects. Even so, the hyperﬁne constant for this state
diﬀers from experiment (3.6% error bar) by a little less
than 7%. This is certainly remarkable considering that
the corresponding discrepancy at the level of RMBPT(2)
is 48%.
It is interesting to note from table IV (fourth
column) that the core-polarization contributions in RCC

4

theory follow the same trend as in RMBPT(2).

The plot in ﬁg. 2 highlights the relative importance
of the core-polarization and pair correlation for the
diﬀerent states. It is instructive to point out that, unlike
the hyperﬁne constant in the ground state of Ba+ [9],
core-polarization eﬀects are larger than pair-correlation
for the ground and ﬁrst excited state, i.e. 6p1/2 and
6p3/2 states of P b+. This is the result of the much
stronger valence-core interactions in P b+ compared to
Ba+.

In summary, the strength of RCC theory has been
exploited to obtain for the ﬁrst time a quantitative
understanding of
relativistic and
correlation eﬀects in the magnetic dipole hyperﬁne
constants for Pb+.
It has been demonstrated that
the results of the DF and RMBPT(2) approximations
diﬀer substantially from the measured values of the

interplay of

the

hyperﬁne constants. However, the inclusion of single,
double and a subset of triple excitations to all orders
in the framework of RCC theory leads to a dramatic
improvement in the results. The relevance of the present
work extends beyond hyperﬁne interactions in Pb+.
Our results highlight the fact that a judicious use of
RCC theory can yield accurate results for properties
that are sensitive to the nuclear region. Indeed, this has
important implications for Tl, which like Pb+ is a heavy
atomic system with strongly interacing conﬁgurations
and is one of the leading candidates for the study of
parity nonconservation due to neutral weak currents
[4, 19, 20].

sions and suggestion for this calculation. It was possible

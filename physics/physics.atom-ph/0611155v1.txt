Abstract. We present progress towards a new measurement of the electron electric dipole moment
using a cold supersonic beam of YbF molecules. Data are currently being taken with a sensitivity

The most precise electric dipole moment (EDM) measurement [1] on the electron gives
28 e.cm, a result consistent with zero. A non-zero result at this
de = (6.9
level would necessarily mean the violation of time reversal symmetry (T) symmetry
and the existence of new particle physics, beyond the Standard Model [2]. Although
the Standard Model does exhibit T violation through the CKM mechanism, the electron
EDM produced by this mechanism is roughly ten orders of magnitude below the present
experimental sensitivity and is for all practical purposes zero. By contrast, many modern
extensions of particle theory lead quite naturally to a value in the current range of
27 e.cm or a little below [3]. Since our experiment using cold YbF molecules aims to
10−
be more sensitive than this, it is a search for new physics. Assuming the validity of CPT,
27 e.cm level would also imply a new type of CP violation.
an electron EDM at the 10−
This would be of great interest for cosmology as it seems to be a necessary ingredient in
understanding the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe [4].

Controlling the stray magnetic ﬁeld at that level seems close to impossible, especially
when applying the electric ﬁeld. Heavy atoms such as Cs and Tl alleviate this problem by
their large enhancement factors. In particular, a (E) =
585 for the thallium atom [6],
which relaxes the necessary ﬁeld control to the challenging, but achievable fT level. Two
magnetic effects are most troublesome. (i) Stray magnetic ﬁelds vary both in space and
time. (ii) Atoms moving through the large electric ﬁeld experience a motional magnetic
v/c2. In both cases the unwanted ﬁeld components are typically many
ﬁeld [7] E
orders of magnitude larger than 1 fT and heroic efforts were needed to reach the current
precision [1].

Heavy polar molecules offer substantial relief from these difﬁculties [8]. First, the
enhancement factors are generically much larger [9] because the electron EDM interacts
with the polarisation of the charge cloud close to the heavy nucleus. In an atom this
polarisation follows from the mixing of higher electronic states by the applied electric
ﬁeld. In a polar molecule, these electronic states are already strongly mixed by the
chemical bond and it is only rotational states that have to be mixed by the applied ﬁeld.
Since these are typically a thousand times closer in energy, the molecular enhancement
factor is correspondingly larger. For the YbF molecule used in our experiment, the
enhancement factor [10] is a
106 at our operating ﬁeld of 13 kV/cm, which relaxes
the requirement on ﬁeld control to the pT level. Figure 1 shows the enhancement
(expressed as an effective electric ﬁeld) as a function of the laboratory ﬁeld. Note that
the polarisation, due to rotational state mixing, saturates at relatively modest ﬁelds.

There is a second advantage to YbF1. Being polar, this molecule has a strong tensor
, the total angular momentum compo-
Stark splitting between sublevels of different
nent along the electric ﬁeld direction. This strongly suppresses the Zeeman shift due
v/c2. For our typical
to perpendicular magnetic ﬁelds, including the motional ﬁeld E
operating parameters, the motion-induced false EDM is reduced by this mechanism to a
level below 10−

33 e.cm [11], which is negligible.

The beam splitter is an rf magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to E and along the beam
direction. When a pulse of molecules arrives at the centre of the rf loop it is subject to a
short pulse of resonant 170 MHz radiation, which induces hyperﬁne population transfer.
It is important that the molecules move as little as possible during this transition because
unwanted phase shifts can occur if the ﬁelds E(t) or B(t) rotate during the splitting
(or recombining) transition. When combined with other imperfections of the apparatus,
such a phase can produce a false EDM and is therefore undesirable. Figure 2(b) shows
the lineshape measured using a 50 m s-long rf pulse, together with a ﬁt to the standard
Rabi formula[13] showing good agreement. With high power ampliﬁers, we are now
able work with pulses 10 m s long, corresponding to a beam movement below 6 mm. The
peak transition probability in Figure 2(b), taken using the ﬁrst loop, is approximately
0.8. This is due to the beam velocity spread, which gives the gas pulse a length of 5 cm
at the ﬁrst loop and 10 cm at the second. Since the rf ﬁeld strength varies along the beam
line, this spatial spread produces a small distribution of Rabi frequencies, which could

be improved by having a more monoenergetic beam.

The arrival of each YbF pulse at our detector is recorded with 1m s resolution. This
time-resolved data gives us a spatial resolution of
5 mm at the second rf loop. This is
the basis of a useful diagnostic technique: varying the timing of the rf pulse allows us
to map out the ﬁeld distribution in the apparatus. This works very well for electric ﬁelds
because the Stark shift of the hyperﬁne transition is large. It can also be used to probe
magnetic ﬁelds, albeit with slightly lower spatial resolution.

∼

NOISE AND SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS

With the YbF interferometer working as described above, the electron EDM measure-
ment is straightforward in principle. A small magnetic ﬁeld is applied to bias the inter-
ferometer phase to the point of highest slope. The applied electric ﬁeld is then reversed
and the change in the interferometer output constitutes the EDM signal. In practice, we
also reverse the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and modulate its amplitude. The EDM is
correlated with the relative direction of E and B while the signals demodulated on the
individual switching channels yield valuable information about the drift of the interfer-
ometer setup and some systematic effects. Additional modulations can be applied: the
relative phase between the splitter and recombiner rf ﬁelds, the laser frequency, the rf
amplitudes and the rf frequencies.

With four switching channels (e.g. E reversal, B reversal, relative rf phase and a
small step D B) there are sixteen possible states of the machine. We cycle through all
of them 256 times to form a “block” of data consisting of 4096 individual points. The
repetition rate is determined by the 25Hz ablation laser which forms the YbF beam, thus
each block of data requires about 3 minutes of real time to record. Slow drifts in the
signal are cancelled by choosing appropriate modulation waveforms for the switching
channels [16]. Figure 3(a) shows the power spectrum of the noise in our molecular beam
signal, as measured by the photomultiplier recording laser-induced ﬂuorescence from

the F = 1 state. Above about 10Hz the spectrum is largely ﬂat, as one would expect
for shot noise due to the statistics of the photon arrivals, but at lower frequencies 1/ f
noise dominates. For this reason, the noise we observe in our EDM measurement usually
exceeds the shot noise level. When the ablation target is moved to expose a fresh spot to
the YAG laser the excess is typically a factor of 1.5, increasing to 2 over the course of
an hour or so, at which point we reset the target.

This non-statistical contribution to the noise in the EDM measurement generates
excess noise in the wings of the normalized distribution shown in ﬁgure 3(b). Although
it is a small effect, this must be taken into account if we are to assign reliable conﬁdence
limits to our EDM measurement. We use a novel bootstrap method. The basic idea is
that the experiment itself provides the best available estimate of the true underlying
probability distribution [17]. Each block of data provides a measurement of the EDM.
By randomly choosing values of the EDM from this experimental data set, we create an
ensemble of additional synthetic EDM data sets having the same distribution. Note that
chosen points are not removed from the pool. Statistical averages are then performed
using these empirical data sets. This method works without needing any analytic model
for the probability distribution; in particular, we avoid making the usual assumption of
a normal distribution. Figure 4 shows the bootstrapped sampling distribution for our
13kV/cm data set and the corresponding cumulative distribution. One sees that the
bootstrap method is putting excess probability into the wings of the distribution, as
expected. The integral of this probability distribution tells us that the true conﬁdence
limits are about 20% larger than one would derive from applying normal Gaussian
statistics to the data set.

The ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld in the laboratory is a possible source of additional noise
in the measured EDM (or worse, a systematic error if changes in the laboratory ﬁeld are
correlated with the switching of the electric ﬁeld). The YbF beam is protected from
external ﬁelds by two layers of magnetic shielding; a ﬂux gate magnetometer between
the shields monitors the residual ﬁeld during data collection. Figure 5(a) shows the
correlation between the ﬁeld measured by the molecular beam and by the magnetometer,
both multiplied by m B/(a E) to express them in units of EDM. The slope of the line
shows that the shielding factor of the inner shield is approximately 100. As there is no

correlation between the external B ﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld reversal, we are conﬁdent
that this magnetic ﬁeld noise does not generate a false EDM at the present level of
sensitivity.

We employ a veto which discards data when the external ﬁeld noise exceeds a certain
threshold. This improves the uncertainty in the EDM measurement, as illustrated in
ﬁgure 5(b) for a subset of our data. This plots the 67% conﬁdence limit on the EDM
vs. the magnetic ﬁeld veto level. The optimal cutoff level is approximately where the
external magnetic ﬁeld induces ﬂuctuations comparable to the EDM measurement error
bar. A veto at this level typically rejects about 15% of our data.

During EDM data acquisition runs, we periodically reverse the electric and magnetic
connections to the apparatus manually. This guards against a false EDM generated by
the external apparatus (for example magnetic ﬁelds from the high voltage relays) or
the data acquisition electronics. Because the experiment has been carefully designed to
minimize such effects, we do not ﬁnd any signal correlated with these manual reversals.
The saturation of the enhancement shown in ﬁgure 1 is another powerful discriminant
against systematics. The interferometer phase induced by a true EDM would have to
vary in this way, whereas a systematic error would be unlikely to do so. For example, the
phase shift due to the magnetic ﬁeld of a relay is constant, whilst the effect of leakage
currents or electrical breakdown grows linearly or faster with the applied voltage. We
have recorded data at the ﬁeld values indicated in the ﬁgure. From the data taken so
far, we can already see that we do not have any strong disagreement with the result
of reference [1], however we have discovered a new systematic effect that needs to be
addressed before we can conﬁdently give a new result at a higher level of accuracy.

As noted previously, the tensor Stark splitting causes the Zeeman shift to depend only
on the magnetic ﬁeld component Bz along the electric ﬁeld direction. As a result, false
E motional ﬁeld and to geometric phases induced by rotating mag-
EDMs due to the v
netic ﬁelds are utterly negligible for the current beam experiment. This strong coupling
of the molecular axis to the external electric ﬁeld is a major blessing, however, it does
also bring with it a potential problem. If the direction of the electric ﬁeld does not reverse
exactly when the voltages are switched, this change of z-axis can produce a change of Bz
and hence a Zeeman shift that mimics an EDM. In our apparatus, the electric ﬁeld plates

are split into three regions so that the splitter and recombiner transitions can take place at
a lower ﬁeld than the central ﬁeld region of the interferometer. In the gaps between these
regions, the ﬁeld lines are curved, causing off-axis molecules to experience a rotation
of the local z-axis as they ﬂy through. If the electric ﬁeld were to reverse perfectly this
would not cause a problem since the rotation angle would be the same for both electric
polarities, but of course no reversal can be perfect. Consequently, a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld
roughly perpendicular to the rotating electric ﬁeld can induce a false EDM. We have
demonstrated this by applying a strong perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld and deliberately in-
troducing a very large asymmetry when the electric ﬁeld reverses. Figure 6 shows a large
false EDM induced in this way. Under our normal operating conditions, we estimate that
this effect should not be larger than

molecules will experience the same magnitude and direction of electric ﬁeld throughout
the entire interferometer. In the new high-ﬁeld splitter and recombiner regions, the ﬁeld
must be homogeneous across the beam to within 0.1% in order to avoid excessive Stark
broadening of the rf transition. This places severe limits on the parallelism of the plates
but the required precision has been achieved with specialist machining techniques and
the new plates are being installed at time of writing.

OUTLOOK

28e.cm range as
At present we anticipate making a measurement with accuracy in the 10−
soon as the new plates are working, which will improve on the result of ref. [1]. Over the
28e.cm without additional major
next few years we expect to reach an accuracy of 1
modiﬁcations. In order to be sure of systematics at this level, it may also be necessary to
perform a control experiment using CaF molecules. These are similar to YbF structurally
and magnetically, but have
40 times less sensitivity to the electron EDM according to
the expected Z3 scaling [8]. We have already made a cold supersonic CaF beam in our
apparatus and have seen the transitions that are needed.

It seems possible to go signiﬁcantly further in measurement accuracy by decelerating
the YbF molecules to increase the time that they spend in the interferometer. With this

in mind, we have demonstrated that our YbF beam can be decelerated [18] and we have
made substantial progress in understanding how to bring heavy polar molecules close to
rest using an alternating gradient decelerator [19]. With the use of an intense, slow YbF
29e.cm. Such
beam, there is no obvious obstacle to a measurement at the level of 1
high precision would provide a probe of new CP-violating elementary particle physics
up to mass scales in the range of many TeV, testing some models far beyond the reach
of current accelerators including the LHC at CERN.

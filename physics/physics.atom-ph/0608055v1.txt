Abstract. We present a thorough analysis of the electronic detection of charged
particles, conﬁned in a Penning trap, via image charges induced in the trap electrodes.
Trapping of charged particles in an electrode structure leads to frequency shifts, which
are due to image charge and space charge eﬀects. These eﬀects are of importance for
Penning trap experiments which involve high charge densities or require high precision
in the motional frequencies. Our analysis of image charges shows that only (higher
order) odd powers of the particle displacement lead to induced charge diﬀerences, giving
rise to a signal. This implies that, besides the centre-of-mass frequency of a trapped
particle cloud, also higher order individual particle frequencies induce a signal, which
can be picked up by an electronic detection circuit attached to the trap electrodes.
We also derive analytic expressions for the image charge and space charge induced
frequency shifts and perform simulations of space charge eﬀects. In relation to this,
we discuss the consequences of the shifted particle frequencies for resistive cooling of
the particle motion.

Electronic detection of charged particle eﬀects in a Penning trap

1. Introduction

Penning traps have proven to be versatile tools for extended investigations of localised
particles under well deﬁned conditions, thus allowing for high-precision experiments.
Such experiments often rely on precise particle manipulation and require knowledge
of the motional frequencies and other dynamic properties of the trapped particles.
However, the presence of charged particles in a Penning trap is accompanied by image
charge and space charge eﬀects, which change the eﬀective trapping potential and
Image charge eﬀects are caused by
therefore lead to oscillation frequency changes.
particle-induced image charges in the trap electrodes and in most cases lead to only
small frequency shifts. However, in precision experiments they still need to be considered
[1, 2]. Space charge eﬀects are caused by the charge density of trapped particles and
lead to considerable frequency shifts and broadening [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

In the following we discuss ideal particle motions in a Penning trap. We present a
thorough analysis of the formation of image charges and determine image charge and
space charge induced frequency shifts of the particle motions. Electronic detection of
the axial particle frequency (section 5) will be discussed, followed by a section on the
implications for resistive cooling of the (shifted) axial frequency (section 6). The aim
of this study is to give a consistent quantitative treatment of these eﬀects. Similar
eﬀects also occur in other types of traps, such as Paul or radio-frequency traps, but
their analysis is beyond the scope of this study.

2. Single particle motion in a Penning trap

In a Penning trap, axial (z) conﬁnement of a single particle is assured by an electrode
structure, typically one ring electrode and two endcaps, that creates a static electric
quadrupole ﬁeld at the centre of the trap. Radial (xy) conﬁnement is obtained by a static
magnetic ﬁeld B along the trap axis (z). Once trapped, a charged particle oscillates
between the two endcaps with ‘axial frequency’ ωz. In the radial plane there are two
motions with distinct frequencies: a fast motion with ‘modiﬁed cyclotron frequency’ ω+,
and a slow motion with ‘magnetron frequency’ ω−. The latter represents a slow drift
about the centre of the trap. The sum of these two frequencies equals the ‘cyclotron
frequency’ ωc = qB/m, where q is the charge of the single particle and m its mass.

The electric ﬁeld inside the Penning trap is described by the quadrupole potential

U, which is given by

where U0 is the trapping potential. The constant R2
0 takes the geometry of
the electrodes into account, where z0 and r0 are the distances from the trap centre to
the endcap and the ring, respectively. A convenient choice for the trap dimensions is
0 = 2z2

0, so that the trap depth is U0/2 [7].

3. Image charge eﬀects

The above description only holds true for the idealised case where there are no
interactions between the particle and its environment. Therefore we need to consider
the interaction between a single charged particle and the ‘image charges’ induced in
the trap electrodes (this section and [10]). When there are more particles in the trap,
also particle-particle interactions or ‘space charge eﬀects’ have to be considered (section
4). In order to understand the formation of image charges we will study two diﬀerent
geometries: a charge between two parallel conducting plates, and a charge between
two hollow conducting spheres. It is worth pointing out that electronic detection and
resistive cooling are based on the detection of image charges via a resonant RLC-circuit
attached to the trap electrodes (sections 5 and 6).

3.1. Charge between two parallel conducting plates

The interaction between a charged particle and a single conducting plate can be
described via the ‘method of images’ [11, 12]. A particle with real charge q, positioned
at a distance z in front of the surface of an inﬁnite conducting plate, induces a surface
charge density σ(r, z) which can be calculated by Gauss’ law and is given by

σ(r, z) =

A charged particle located between two parallel conducting plates induces a series
of images. This is schematically shown in ﬁgure 1 by the curved arrows. Upon a

displacement z, the real charge q induces an image charge qL
1 .
in the right plate at zR
This, in turn, induces an image qR
2 , and so on. A second

sequence of images also appears, starting with qR
1 induced in the right plate. For a
positively charged particle (q > 0), positive (even) images are located at even multiples
of the plate separation d, i.e. the distances
4d, . . .. Negative (odd) images are
2d,
located at odd multiples of d, i.e. the distances
3d, . . .. The top dashed lines

indicate the positions of the image charges for z = 0, the lower ones (and the small
black arrows) for z > 0.

From equation (7) it is clear that the image charge depends on the radius R of
the plates, which implies that for ﬁnite R the image qi is ‘imperfect’. For an image

R of an inﬁnite plate. When R is small compared to d, the images are imperfect and
the series terminates rapidly. The induced charge diﬀerence ∆q between the two plates

is deﬁned as ∆q = qL
qR, where qL and qR are the sums of the charges induced in
the left and in the right plate, respectively. When the particle is located close to the
right plate, ∆q is positive, and vice versa. For a ﬁnite plate radius R < d, it suﬃces to
consider only 3 images induced in both plates, as shown in ﬁgure 1, to obtain a good
description of ∆q. For such a simple case, it can be shown that ∆q is given by a power
series with only odd powers of z, i.e.

γ1z + γ3z3 + γ5z5 + . . .

∆q

(9)

The expressions for γi show that mainly the odd images contribute to ∆q and that they
lead to (higher order) odd powers of z. For increasing R, the variation becomes close to
linear, which can be veriﬁed by extending the series to inﬁnity. In that case the higher
order odd terms vanish almost completely, leaving ∆q

γ1z.

In ﬁgure 2 the calculated dependence of ∆q is plotted as a function of the position
z of the real charge q = 1 between two parallel conducting plates (dashed line) with
radius R = 0.5 mm, which are separated by a distance d = 2.0 mm. Figure 2 clearly
shows that for small z, ∆q is almost linear with z, whereas for larger z, ∆q varies with
odd powers of z. For ﬁxed R, when d
R, ∆q is very non-linear at large z, due to
strong higher order terms. When d > R, ∆q is rather linear, but the induced charge
diﬀerence is small. For inﬁnitely large plates R
, the response is very linear. Below
we will show that higher order odd terms not only occur for planar electrodes, but also
for curved electrodes (solid line in ﬁgure 2).

3.2. Charge between two hollow conducting spheres

In a conventional Penning trap geometry, the endcap electrodes are better approximated
by two hollow conducting spheres, ignoring the presence of the ring electrode. The case

of a charge outside a single hollow conducting sphere can easily be solved (see e.g. [13]).
As illustrated in ﬁgure 3a), the real charge q, located outside the sphere at X, induces
an image charge Q located at r inside the sphere.

The potential at a point P on the surface of the sphere, is given by [13]

V =

where the distances

a2 = R2 + X 2 + 2XR cos(α)
b2 = R2 + r2 + 2rR cos(α)

are given by the cosine rule, and ǫ0 is the permittivity of free space. After satisfying
the boundary condition that the potential at any point P on the grounded conducting
surface is zero, the real charge and its image are related as follows

r = R2/X
q =

Now two spheres A and B with radius R and separated by 2D, as depicted in ﬁgure
3b), are considered. Upon a displacement z, the real charge q induces an image charge
1 in sphere B at zB
qB
2 in sphere A, and so on.
A second sequence of images also appears, starting with qA
1 induced in sphere A. For

conducting plates, the induced charge diﬀerence is deﬁned as ∆q = qA
qB, where qA
and qB are the sums of the charges induced in sphere A and sphere B, respectively. Also
in this case, for a ﬁnite sphere radius R, it suﬃces to consider only 3 images in both
spheres to obtain a good approximation to ∆q. Again, for such a simple case, it can be
shown that ∆q is given by a power series with only odd powers of z.

−

In ﬁgure 2 ∆q is plotted as a function of the position z of the real charge q = 1
between two hollow conducting spheres (solid line) with radius R = 0.5 mm, which are
separated by a distance 2D = 3.0 mm, giving a gap of d = 2.0 mm. The black dots
are calculated using equation (9) for the 2 spheres case, taking only 3 images in both
spheres into account. From equation (9) in ﬁgure 2 it can clearly be seen that the higher
order odd terms are non-negligible for larger values of z. This analysis shows that also
here, as in the case of 2 plates, mainly the odd images contribute to ∆q and that they
again lead to higher order odd powers of z. When D
R, ∆q is very non-linear at large
z, due to strong higher order terms, but when D > R, ∆q is rather linear.

4. Frequency shifts due to image charge and space charge eﬀects

The image charge and space charge eﬀects change the eﬀective trapping potential and
therefore lead to frequency changes. In the following, starting from the potentials at
the trap centre, we derive analytic expressions for these frequency shifts and compare
their predictions with experimental results obtained in measurements of clouds of ions
conﬁned in a Penning trap. In the case of the space charge eﬀects we have also performed
simulations, which conﬁrm and support our analysis and are in line with experimental
results.

4.1. Image charge shift

As can be seen in ﬁgure 1, the eﬀective distance between the particle and the positive
(even) images does not change as it moves between the plates. Therefore, only negative
(odd) images exert a net force on the particle. For a single conﬁned charged particle,
the total force is thus given by the sum of the force due to the quadrupole potential and
the image force. From ﬁgure 1, it can be seen that the image force is given by

where the summation is over odd images i only. Wineland et al.
[14] stated that

the image force is given by F im
displacement z is much smaller than the separation between the plates d. Our analysis

shows that equation (14) is better approximated, even for small z, by including the

In analogy with section 3, it can be shown that mainly odd images contribute to the
image force and that they lead to (higher order) odd powers of the particle displacement
z. However, since the higher order eﬀects are small for harmonic motion (small z), we
will here just consider the ﬁrst order term in equation (16). The corresponding equation
of motion in the axial direction is given by

where the higher order eﬀects have been neglected. If there are more particles between
the plates, the image force and thus the axial frequency shift scales with the number of
particles N. A result similar to equation (19) is obtained when the particle is considered
to move inside a hollow conducting sphere [3, 15]. The image force aﬀects the centre-
of-mass(c.m.) motion of a particle cloud, because it is an induced external force acting
on the cloud as a whole.

Due to its radial motions, i.e. the magnetron and modiﬁed cyclotron motions, the
charged particle also induces image charges in the ring electrode, which aﬀect the radial
frequencies.
In order to calculate this radial image force, an approximate treatment
similar to that given in section 3.2 can be applied, where the ring electrode is a small
central section of the surface of a sphere.

As can be seen from ﬁgure 3a), the force between the charges q and Q is given by

which is the radial image force on the particle due to one sphere. However, now the
real charge q is located inside the sphere and its image lies outside. As the ring is
considered as a small central section of the sphere’s surface, for this case there will also
be an image force like equation (21), albeit lower in magnitude due to the fact that
not all the ﬁeld lines originating from the charge q are directed at the section. Or, in
other words, the image charge that is formed is imperfect. A charged particle with, for
example, a magnetron radius r will thus experience a shifted magnetron frequency due
to the induced charge in the ring.

For a positively charged particle, the radial image force is directed radially outward,
following the direction of the electric quadrupole force. The corresponding shifted radial
frequencies are given by

where γ is related to the ratio of the surface areas of the ring and the sphere.

The image charge shift is only signiﬁcant for very small traps and in most cases
represents much less than 1 % of the axial frequency. Measurements of the image
charge shift dependence on the number of particles have been performed for 1H+,
2H+, 3He+, 3He2+, and 12C4+ ions [3] and frequency shifts were observed even for
small numbers of particles. The magnetron frequency was shifted upwards and the
modiﬁed cyclotron frequency was shifted downwards, as expected from equation (22).
The relative magnitudes of the observed shifts, about 20 mHz per ion per charge, are
also in fair agreement with those predicted by equation (22). For the cyclotron frequency
ωc = ω+ + ω− no shift has been observed, as expected.

4.2. Space charge shift

Similarly to the image charge eﬀect, there is a potential due to the presence of space
charge which adds to the trapping potential and thus changes the trapping frequencies.
The space charge potential U ′ is the potential seen by a particle due to the presence of
all other particles and can be derived in a manner similar to the quadrupole potential.
As a simple example, it is assumed that the particle cloud can be described by a perfect
sphere with radius R′ and homogeneous charge density ρ = Nq/V ′, where N is the
number of particles and V ′ = 4πR′3/3 the volume of the sphere. Laplace’s law in
spherical coordinates (η, θ, φ) applied to this particle cloud states that

where spherical symmetry with respect to θ and φ holds.

Outside the sphere the potential can be described by that of a point charge, i.e.

Both terms on the right-hand side of equation (26) vary linearly with z, i.e. equation

which appears in the denominator of the space charge term in equation (27), accounts
for the geometry of the particle cloud. In a more general case, when the particle cloud
is not a sphere but rather an ellipsoid, this constant changes.
If the cloud shape is
‘prolate’ the factor is smaller than 3, if the shape is ‘oblate’ it is larger [16]. To ﬁrst
order, the absolute frequency shift is given by

The space charge limit is reached for

U ′
, i.e. when the space charge potential
compensates the trapping potential. In this case there is no potential minimum and
conﬁnement is lost.

If the space charge density is not homogeneous, but has a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution, the space charge shift depends on the average distance of the particle
from the cloud centre [18]. This leads to a distribution of shifted axial frequencies.
However, the c.m.-motion of a particle cloud is not aﬀected by intra-cloud interactions
and thus remains unshifted by space charge eﬀects [14]. A similar broadening of the axial
frequency distribution occurs when the trapping potential is anharmonic. In that case,
the axial frequency depends on the amplitude of the motion such that a distribution of
particle energies automatically leads to a distribution of axial frequencies. To correct for
such anharmonicities, most Penning traps have compensation electrodes (see e.g. [19]).
The space charge potential U ′ also aﬀects the radial motions and thus the radial
frequencies of the particle. Due to the diﬀerence in signs between the z- and r-

Thus, there is a downwards shift of the modiﬁed cyclotron frequency ω+ and an upwards

Measurements of the magnetron frequency of an ion cloud in a Penning trap with
6 V and B = 1 T were performed by Dholakia et
r0 = 5 mm, z0 = 3.5 mm, U0
al. [4] through laser cooling and laser spectroscopic techniques. For a single ion they
40 kHz, while for clouds with ion number densities of
yield a magnetron frequency of
the order of 107 cm−3, the corresponding value is shifted to
60 kHz. This is in fair
accordance with the behaviour expected from equation (30).

4.3. Simulations of the space charge shift

In an eﬀort to check the validity of the results of the calculation, the inﬂuence of space
charge has been studied using SIMION, which allows for charged particle tracking in

The ion cloud is simulated by a cubic array, typically of size 5x5x5, in which a
charge of magnitude e′ is assigned to each array point. So, for a cloud of N = 125
charged particles e′ = q

particles, e′ = q
e. The particle-particle interactions are simulated by SIMION
1000
using the grouped Coulomb repulsion e′. Within this approximation, small clouds are
clearly better described than large ones. It may be speculated that a simulation where
N particles are simulated by N array points would result in the frequency shift expected
from equation (29). This, however, is not within our computational capabilities since
the computation time scales with N 2. Once a simulation produced several periods of
oscillation (for all particles), the simulation was terminated and the particle frequencies
were extracted from the data by means of Fourier analysis.

The results of our simulations are shown in ﬁgure 4, where the relative axial
frequency shift is plotted versus the number of particles in the cloud. The parameters
106
were: z0 = 15 mm, U0 = 1000 V, B = 1 T, N = 125000 (5x5x5 array) and n = 4
m−3. The simulations show a linear relationship between the relative axial frequency
shift and the number of particles. Also shown is a plot of equation (29), which behaves
linearly for small n (
N) as expected, but clearly deviates from the results of our
simulations for larger numbers of particles. This discrepancy is attributed to the limited
number of array points used in our simulations, the cubic lattice geometry (rather than
spherical), and the method used to simulate high ion densities (i.e. via e′). However,

for large N also the approximation used for the derivation of equation (29) is no longer
accurate.

The c.m.-motion of the cloud is found to be invariant under the inﬂuence of
interaction between the particles, as expected. However, as shown by the inset in
ﬁgure 4, the relative frequency shift is larger for particles that are initially positioned
close the cloud centre than for particles that are further out. This is attributed to the
fact that the amount of space charge surrounding the particle drops with increasing
distance from the cloud centre.

5. Electronic detection of the axial motion

In order to experimentally determine the axial frequency, a resonant RLC-circuit with
a high quality factor (see section 6) is connected to the endcaps. A Fourier analysis of
the induced current I in the RLC-circuit, picked up by a sensitive ampliﬁer, then yields
ωz. For the case of a charge between two parallel conducting plates, the current ﬂow at
any time is

I =

∂∆q
∂t

=

∂∆q

where ∆q is the induced charge diﬀerence between the two endcaps. For parallel plates
with large radii, ∆q varies linearly with z, i.e. ∆q = γ1z. However, in many other
cases, as we have shown above in equation (9) and ﬁgure 2, there can be higher order
odd terms as well. For example, if ∆q = γ1z + γ3z3, it can be shown that the electronic
circuit also picks up the higher order term. For simple harmonic motion, of the form
z = z0 cos(ωzt), one obtains

The cubic term therefore induces signals at ωz and 3ωz.

Consider a single particle with mass m and charge q which is moving inside a
particle cloud of mass M and charge Q. In this case only the c.m.-motion of the cloud
will normally be detected. If the particles are all identical, then q/m = Q/M. If the
position of q is z and the position of Q is Z, then Z =
qz/Q in order for
the c.m. to be stationary. This would be the case for small oscillations of the particle
about an equilibrium position, i.e. the normal modes of the system. The induced charge
diﬀerence, with q and Q moving such that the c.m. is stationary, is

mz/M =

Again the signal is induced by the cubic term, which gives rise to signals at ωz and 3ωz.
If the oscillation frequency of q in the environment Q is reduced from the single-particle
value, then this shifted frequency will be seen in the signal around ωz, so long as the
term in γ3 is present.

If the amplitudes of motion are larger than the interparticle spacing, the normal
mode description no longer applies. In this case the motion of an individual particle does
not necessarily give rise to a compensating motion of the rest of the cloud. Therefore,
the individual oscillation frequencies of all particles are observed directly in the detected
signal [22], i.e. via the non-linear term in equation (32).

6. Resistive cooling of the axial motion

For a single ion, the current I running through the resonant RLC-circuit results in an
exponential decrease of the particle’s kinetic energy, which is given by [14]

E(t) = E0exp(

t/τ )

and τ =

−

m(2z0)2
Rq2

where R is the resistance of the RLC-circuit. In resonance, the impedance of an RLC-
circuit is real and acts as an ohmic resistor with resistance R = QLωz, where Q is
the quality factor of the circuit and L the inductance. The bandwidth is given by
∆νz = νz/Q and for typical values (νz ∼
1 kHz.
The resistive cooling time constant, expressed in terms of the circuit components, is
given by

1000) the bandwidth is

1MHz, Q

The cooling process ﬁnally leads to an equilibrium between the particle’s kinetic energy
and the temperature of the heat bath. However, the noise temperature in the electronics
may exceed the physical temperature of the RLC-circuit, leading to somewhat higher
temperatures of the particles [23]. Deviations from the exponential cooling behaviour
may occur when the dissipated power is not proportional to the kinetic energy of the
particles. For example, if the trap is anharmonic, ωz depends on the particle’s kinetic
energy and may move out of resonance with the RLC-circuit [7, 17].

For coherent c.m.-motion of a particle cloud with N particles, the total induced
current is given by Itot = NI, and correspondingly this motion is strongly cooled. Apart
from the coherent c.m.-motion, there can be non-coherent motions of ions within the
cloud. As described above, these individual ion motions give rise to a resultant induced
signal in the RLC-circuit [17, 22]. Since the signals from the non-coherent motions
cancel to ﬁrst order, the corresponding cooling is weaker and therefore the cooling times
are longer [24].

As discussed in section 4.2, space charge eﬀects generally lead to a shifted and
broadened distribution of axial frequencies of trapped particles. Resistive cooling is
only eﬀective within the bandwidth of the external circuit, which may be less than the
range of frequencies expected from the space charge eﬀects. In large ion clouds the axial
frequency distribution may be considerably broadened by space charge eﬀects (see e.g.
inset ﬁgure 4). In that case, it is expected that the inter-particle collisions continuously
thermalise the cloud by redistributing energy over the cloud’s axial frequencies so
that the resistive cooling process continues, but at a reduced rate limited by the
thermalisation process. The inter-particle collision rate for a single component, trapped
q4m−1/2nT −3/2 where q is the particle’s charge,
particle cloud is characterised by k
m its mass, n the particle number density and T the intrinsic temperature of the ion
cloud [25]. Therefore, thermalisation is most eﬃcient for light, highly charged particles
in a dense, cold ion cloud.
It may be expected that, for an eﬃcient thermalisation
process, the cooling time of a particle cloud scales with the bandwidth of the RLC-
circuit. Therefore, in practical applications, a compromise has to be found between
a suﬃciently small cooling time constant τ
1/Q and a suﬃciently large bandwidth

1/Q.

7. Conclusions

We have presented a thorough analysis of the formation of image charges. Such a study
is relevant because the images formed in the trap electrodes of a Penning trap will be
picked up by an electronic detection circuit attached to the trap electrodes. Our analysis
was done for the case of two parallel conducting plates and for the case of two hollow
conducting spheres. It was found that in both systems mainly the negative (odd) images
contribute to the induced charge diﬀerence ∆q between the two electrodes. These images
lead to (higher order) odd dependences of ∆q on the particle’s position z between the
electrodes and its oscillation frequency ωz. We therefore concluded that an electronic
detection system can, in principle, pick up higher order frequencies of the particle motion
as well. Such frequencies can, for example, be induced by individual particle motions at
a frequency 3ωz, rather than exclusively at the common centre-of-mass motion at the
frequency ωz.

We have also derived analytic expressions for the shifted frequencies of trapped
particles, which are due to image charge eﬀects and space charge eﬀects. Both eﬀects
lead to a downwards shift of the axial frequency ωz and the modiﬁed cyclotron frequency

ω+, but to an upwards shift of the magnetron frequency ω−. These shifts depend strongly
on the charge density of the conﬁned particle cloud and on geometrical trap parameters.
Our simulations qualitatively conﬁrmed the downwards shift of the axial frequency. In
addition, they also showed that in cold ion clouds, with motional amplitudes smaller
than the cloud dimensions, the frequency shift depends on the particle’s average distance
from the cloud centre.

Resistive cooling of a trapped particle cloud depends also on the image charges
induced in trap electrodes, and on the energy dissipation in an external heat bath
formed by a frequency resonant RLC-circuit. Due to the limited bandwidth of such
a circuit, space charge induced shifts and broadening of the axial trapping frequency
distribution need to be taken into account. Furthermore, to ﬁrst order only the centre-
of-mass mode induces a signal in the circuit. Since the cooling is eﬀective only within
the bandwidth of the circuit, resistive cooling of large clouds, where considerable space
charge eﬀects occur, may diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the single particle case and may lead
to much longer cooling times.

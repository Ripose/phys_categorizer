We demonstrate that transitions between Zeeman-split sublevels of Rb atoms are resonantly
induced by the motion of the atoms (velocity: ∼ 100 m/s) in a periodic magnetostatic ﬁeld (period:
1 mm) when the Zeeman splitting corresponds to the frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld experienced
by the moving atoms. A circularly polarized laser beam polarizes Rb atoms with a velocity selected
using the Doppler eﬀect and detects their magnetic resonance in a thin cell, to which the periodic
ﬁeld is applied with the arrays of parallel current-carrying wires.

By applying an electromagnetic (EM) wave to an atom
at rest, one can resonantly induce transition between two
atomic energy levels whose frequency diﬀerence coincides
with the EM wave frequency. This resonance transition
is one of the most extensively studied and widely utilized
phenomena in atomic physics and also in other various
ﬁelds. Also in the reversed conﬁguration, that is, by an
atom moving in a static periodic ﬁeld, an internal transi-
tion can be made when the periodic perturbation experi-
enced by the atom has a frequency equal to the transition
frequency. The resonance transition of this kind, quite
simple in principle and applicable to any particle with
internal states, however, has been clearly demonstrated
only in the phenomenon called “resonant coherent exci-
tation” (RCE) [1] using channeled fast ion beams in pe-
riodic electric ﬁelds of crystals. RCE has attracted much
attention [2, 3] since the ﬁrst proposal by Okorokov [4].
Recent progress made by using the high-energy beams
of highly charged ions shows the possibility of high res-
olution spectroscopy of highly charged ions in an X-ray
region of keV or 1018 Hz [5]. The order of this transition
frequency is determined by an ion velocity (∼ 108 m/s)
and a lattice constant (∼ 10−10 m).

We report in this Letter on the resonance transition
that is based on the same principles as RCE but is in-
duced by a diﬀerent type of interaction in a quite dif-
ferent energy range of neV or 105 Hz: magnetic reso-
nance between the Zeeman sublevels of Rb atoms with a
z velocity component of vz ∼ 100 m/s in a static mag-
netic ﬁeld that is periodic in the z direction (period:
a = 1 mm). This resonance transition, called motion-
induced resonance in this Letter, was observed in a thin
cell containing Rb vapor, with the periodic magnetic ﬁeld
applied with the arrays of parallel current-carrying wires
sandwiching the cell. The atoms with a velocity selected
using the Doppler eﬀect were polarized by optical pump-
ing with circularly polarized laser light slightly detuned
from the D2 line. The magnetic resonance between the
ground state sublevels was optically detected with the
same laser beam. We conﬁrmed that the resonance oc-
curs when the Zeeman splitting frequency coincides with

vz/a, namely the frequency of the ﬁeld experienced by the
moving atoms. We successfully obtained the resonance
spectra very similar to those of standard RF magnetic
resonance. Our clear demonstration of motion-induced
resonance shows that experiments using slow atoms and
artiﬁcial periodic ﬁelds are useful to study the fundamen-
tal dynamics of this kind of resonance compared to RCE
experiments, which involve complicated atomic processes
in solid. We also consider that this experiment is the
ﬁrst step to extend the study to well-controlled atoms
in the ﬁelds of precise- and small-period structures with
the help of advancing surface nanofabrication technolo-
gies and progressing atom control and manipulation tech-
niques, particularly near surfaces, such as atom chips [6]
and quantum reﬂection [7]. These studies will reveal a
new aspect of motion-induced resonance, and may lead to
the development of unique techniques alternative to EM
wave methods to control the internal states and also the
associated motional states (see next paragraph) of atoms
(and any particle with internal states) near surfaces.

We ﬁrst discuss the basic properties of motion-induced
resonance from a perspective of the momentum and en-
ergy of an atom in analogy to atom–EM-wave resonance
to get a better understanding rather than the simple pic-
ture that the resonance transition occurs when the fre-
quency of the ﬁeld experienced by an atom coincides with
the transition frequency. When the internal state of an
atom is excited in an EM standing wave, the momentums
and energies of the atom before and after excitation are
related as

citation induced by one of the counterpropagating waves

can deduce from Eq. (1) the well-known resonance con-
dition E′ − E = ∆E = hν ∓ hvz/λ, where hvz/λ repre-
sents the Doppler shift. Note that although h/λ and hν
are regarded as the momentum and the energy of a pho-
ton, respectively, the momentum and energy relations in
Eq. (1) can be derived from the classical description of
ﬁeld periodicity and oscillation, repsectively [8]. There-
fore in the case of motion-induced resonance it is justiﬁed
that, in an inertial frame where the static periodic ﬁeld
is at rest, one sets ν = 0 while keeping λ = a in Eq. (1).
The corresponding relations are [9]

+ mv′2/2 = E + mv2/2.

(2)

One has to take the lower sign in the case ∆E > 0.
The resonance condition ∆E = hvz/a is then deduced.
From this discussion it can be said that the transition
is caused purely by the Doppler eﬀect, and the internal
energy is increased at the expense of the kinetic energy.
In addition, as a consequence of the ﬁeld periodicity, the
atom momentum should change by h/a in the transition
(note that this momentum change is transfered to the
periodic structure that produces the periodic ﬁeld). This
fact, although not having been veriﬁed experimentally,
may be used to control the motional state of atoms by
motion-induced resonance.

The experiment was performed with a thin quartz cell
(inner dimension: 48 × 10 × 0.2 mm), whose cross sec-
tion is depicted in Fig. 1(a). The evacuated cell con-
tains Rb vapor with a density of ∼ 109 cm−3 at room
temperature, where the Doppler broadening for the Rb
D2 transition at 780 nm is about 250 MHz (half width

2

at half maximum: HWHM). The natural linewidth of
the D2 line is 3 MHz (HWHM). An external cavity laser
diode, whose linewidth was estimated to be 1 MHz, was
frequency-stabilized to the F=3 → F′=4 transition of the
D2 line of 85Rb (see Fig. 1(b)). The uncertainty of the
laser frequency was at most a few MHz. The laser fre-
quency was then shifted (see Fig. 1(b)) with an acousto-
optic frequency shifter in the range of 123-203 MHz to
select a atom velocity in the range of vz = 96 to 158 m/s
through the F=3 → F′=4 transition. The laser beam was
ﬁnally made right-circularly polarized and irradiated the
whole volume of the narrow cell gap to polarize the F=3
ground state of atoms with a velocity component vz in the
laser direction. Note that atoms with a velocity vz + 94
or vz + 144 m/s were also polarized through the transi-
tion F=3 → F′=3 or F′=2. However, they are fewer than
atoms with a velocity vz, and also tend to become oﬀ-
resonant with the laser due to hyperﬁne pumping to the
F=2 ground state via the excited states. Therefore they
should not signiﬁcantly contribute to the signal. A peri-
odic magnetostatic ﬁeld (period: a = 1 mm) was applied
to the cell with two printed circuit boards (PCBs) (100
× 30 mm) sandwiching the cell. The current direction
and the current-carrying trace on a PCB are shown in
Fig. 1(c), (d), respectively. The details of the produced
periodic ﬁeld is described in the next paragraph. A longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld applied along the laser beam with
a set of Helmholtz coils (40 cm dia.) was slowly scanned
to cause the Zeeman splitting by 4.67 kHz per µT be-
tween the adjacent sublevels of the F=3 state. The res-
onant transitions between the sublevels occurred when
the splitting frequency coincided with the frequency of
the ﬁeld experienced by the atoms under observation.
The resonance was detected by monitoring the transmit-
ted laser intensity, which increased when the polarization
was destroyed at resonance. This increase corresponded
to typically 10−5 − 10−6 variation of the laser beam in-
tensity. For better detection sensitivity, we employed
a lock-in detection scheme by switching on and oﬀ the
periodic ﬁeld at 4 kHz, and further averaged the lock-
in signals. The cell, PCBs and coils were enclosed in a
magnetic shield (65 × 65 × 65 cm), which reduced the
Earth’s and other environmental magnetic ﬁelds to the
order of 0.1 µT. To perform a standard RF magnetic res-
onance experiment for comparison with motion-induced
resonance, the PCBs were removed and then resonance
proﬁles were recorded as a transverse oscillating mag-
netic ﬁeld was applied with another set of Helmholtz coils
(15 cm dia.).

The basic behavior of the ﬁeld produced by the PCBs
in the cell is described analytically, using the coordinate
system deﬁned in Fig. 1(c), as

Bx = B0 exp(−kd) cosh(kx) sin(kz), By = 0,
Bz = B0 exp(−kd) sinh(kx) cos(kz).

by unit PCB current. The coordinate system is deﬁned in
Fig. 1(c). The cell is located in the center of the PCBs and
the current ﬂows on the surfaces at x = ±0.65 mm. The
upper graph shows the whole picture of the produced ﬁeld at
x = y = 0 mm (cell center) as a function of z. The lower left

x = ±d; d was measured to be 0.65 mm. Figure 2 shows
the numerically calculated periodic magnetic ﬁeld pro-
duced by the actual PCB current. At the center of the
cell (x = y = 0 mm), the x component of the ﬁeld Bx be-
haves as sin(kz) with an amplitude of 65 µT/A, although
its baseline declines slightly along the z direction due to
the ﬁnite number of current wires [10] as seen in the up-
per graph in Fig. 2. Bz is equal to zero, while By has
a small value of 1 ∼ 2 µT/A, which is produced by the
current ﬂowing in the z direction on the PCB edges at
y ≃ ±15 mm. Near the cell surfaces at x = ±0.1 mm, Bx
is larger by 20% than at the center as seen in the lower-
right graph in Fig. 2, while Bz oscillates as well with an
amplitude of 43 µT/A. This longitudinal Bz ﬁeld experi-
enced by moving atoms is so rapidly oscillating, however,
that it does not aﬀect resonance proﬁles in the exper-
iment. Note that the sandwiching conﬁguration of the
PCBs reduces a strong dependence of the ﬁeld strength
on x around x = 0, contrary to an exponentially (1/e
constant: a/(2π)) decreasing ﬁeld with increasing dis-
tance from a single periodic source [11]. Finally, near
the cell edges at y = ±5 mm the produced ﬁeld is basi-
cally the same as described above. As a summary, the
produced periodic ﬁeld can essentially approximate to a
sinusoidal ﬁeld oscillating in the x direction with a con-

to obtain motion-induced resonance proﬁles similar to
RF resonance ones. We ﬁnally note that the calculated
ﬁeld strength has an uncertainty of about ±10%, which
is mainly due to an uncertainty in the position of the
PCB current (d = 0.65 ± 0.02 mm) .

quency detunings are 203 MHz, 163 MHz, and 123 MHz,
corresponding to selected velocities of 158 m/s, 127 m/s,
and 96 m/s, respectively. The two resonance peaks are
clearly observed, almost symmetric with respect to the
zero magnetic ﬁeld. One may notice the slightly larger
resonance signals in the negative longitudinal ﬁeld than
in the positive ﬁeld, noticeable also in RF resonance spec-
tra (see Fig. 4(b)). We consider that this is attributed to
a small diﬀerence in the laser absorption probability due
to the Zeeman shifts of sublevels. As the laser detuning
(and hence the selected velocity) decreases, the resonance
peaks move toward the zero magnetic ﬁeld (and hence the
zero Zeeman splitting) as seen in Fig. 3(a). We derived
with an uncertainty of a few kHz the sublevel splitting
f at which the resonance peak was centered with the
help of Lorentzian ﬁttings, and plot it as a function of
selected velocity vz in Fig. 3(b). As clearly seen, the res-
onance frequency is proportional to the atom velocity as
f = vz/a (a = 1 mm), which is the resonance condition
of motion-induced resonance.

The spectral width was found to be mainly determined
by the light intensity and the periodic ﬁeld strength from
measurements performed by changing each parameter in-

FIG. 4: (a) Motion-induced resonance spectrum obtained for
a laser detuning of 203 MHz and hence a selected velocity

dependently. Fig. 4(a) shows narrower linewidth for a
weaker laser intensity and PCB current than in Fig. 3(a).
The linewidth was still decreasing with decreasing laser
intensity and PCB current in the ranges of the intensity
and current of Fig. 4(a), although we could not reduce
them further due to the limit of detection sensitivity in
the present experimental setup. The width (HWHM)
of the spectrum in Fig. 4(a) is 56 kHz (12 µT), corre-
sponding to an eﬀective transverse spin relaxation time
of 3 µs. This relaxation time is of the same order as
the mean free time between collisions of atoms with the
cell surfaces, where the spin polarization is supposed to
be completely destroyed.
It is interesting to point out
that the spectral width should become much narrower
with decreasing laser intensity than that determined by
the mean free time, because of selective polarization and
detection of atoms that have long free ﬂight times (and
hence have long spin relaxation times) [12].

We show in Fig. 4(b) a magnetic resonance spectrum
recorded in the standard magnetic resonance experiment,
namely recorded with a transverse RF magnetic ﬁeld os-
cillating at 156 kHz, for the laser intensity and ﬁeld am-
plitude similar to the case of Fig. 4(a). The laser detun-
ing is the same as that in Fig. 4(a), although the selected
velocity dependence is negligible in RF resonance. As
seen in this ﬁgure, the shape of the spectrum is basi-
cally identical to that of the motion-induced resonance
as we have expected, while its width is somewhat smaller
(50 kHz HWHM). This small diﬀerence may probably be
attributed to additional factors that increase the reso-
nance width in motion-induced resonance in our experi-
mental setup. One factor is the ﬁnite width in selected
velocity, originating from the natural linewidth and the
laser-power broadening of the D2 absorption line. The

4

non-periodic transverse magnetic ﬁeld produced by the
PCB current is another factor, about a few µT/A in the
x and y directions. The current in the wires connect-
ing the two PCBs and the PCBs to a power supply also
produces a transverse ﬁeld of the same order.

In conclusion, we have clearly demonstrated that mag-
netic transitions are resonantly induced in an artiﬁcial
periodic magnetic structure by the motion of Rb atoms
having thermal energy at room temperature. We have
conﬁrmed that the magnetic resonance occurs when the
Zeeman splitting of the ground state of Rb atoms corre-
sponds to the atom velocity divided by the ﬁeld period.
Resonance proﬁles quite similar to those of standard RF
magnetic resonance have been obtained. We ﬁnally em-
phasize that motion-induced resonance, whose principles
have been demonstrated only in so-called resonant co-
herent excitation by using channeled fast ion beams in
crystal ﬁelds, is a general phenomenon that occurs for
various scales of ﬁeld periods and kinetic/transition en-
ergies of particles, and also for various types of particles
and interactions. Our demonstration opens the door to
a new class of experiments relevant to this resonance for
slow atoms in artiﬁcial periodic ﬁelds.

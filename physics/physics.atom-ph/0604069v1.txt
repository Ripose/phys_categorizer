Abstract

We discuss a class of quantum Abraham models in which the N -particle spinor
wave function of N electrons solves a Pauli respectively Schr¨odinger equation,
featuring regularized classical electromagnetic potentials which solve the semi-
relativistic Maxwell-Lorentz equations for regularized point charges, which
move according to some de Broglie-Bohm law of quantum motion. Thus
there is a feedback loop from the actual particle motions to the wave function.
The electrons have a bare charge and positive bare mass diﬀerent from their
empirical charge and mass due to renormalization by the self-ﬁelds. In the
classical limit the various models reduce to the Hamilton-Jacobi version of
corresponding Abraham models of classical electron theory.

Introduction

Beside GRW quantum mechanics [1], de Broglie-Bohm quantum mechanics [2, 3, 4, 5],
a.k.a. Bohmian mechanics [6], is another ontologically clear theory. Consider N not mu-
e and empirical
tually interacting nonrelativistic spin 1/2 electrons, each having charge
R3, k =
mass m. The electrons are regarded as real particles with actual positions qk(t)
R3N , move according to
1, ..., N which, when grouped together as (q1, ..., qN )(t) = ~q(t)

where the velocity ﬁeld ~v on labeled N particle conﬁguration space R3N is deﬁned by
ρ~v = ~j, where ρ = ψ†ψ is the conventional Born formula for the “probability” density1
and ~j is a probability current density vector associated to ψ by the continuity equation

~j = 0. Clearly, ~j is only determined up to an additive curl. Two possibilities
have been proposed in the literature, see [4] and [5]. Writing ~j = (j1, ..., jN ), the minimal

In all situations where non-electromagnetic eﬀects as well as electromagnetic eﬀects
due to so-called second quantization are negligible and whenever the electrons move at
speeds much less than light, this setup works well for all practical purposes as long as
the ﬁelds generated by the external sources are so strong that the contributions from the
N electrons to the total ﬁelds are negligible. The model also explains what is happening
rather than having recourse to the obscure “measurement formalism.” However, even as-
suming a purely electromagnetic world, the various “approximations” are not satisfactory
conceptually as long as it is not really clear what consistent model the above model is
approximate to! Some of the conceptual inconsistencies are:

•

the electrons react passively to electromagnetic ﬁelds but do not actively produce
ﬁelds, thus:

– the external sources evolve in some essentially arbitrarily chosen manner, in-
ﬂuencing the electrons through the ﬁelds they create without being inﬂuenced
by the electrons;

– the electrons neither inﬂuence each other nor themselves individually;

the dynamics of the ﬁelds, given the sources in one Lorentz frame, satisﬁes Lorentz-
invariant equations while the equations for the electrons, given the ﬁelds, are Galilei-
invariant;

the electrons satisfy a quantum dynamics, the ﬁelds a classical dynamics.

•

•

In this paper we will be chieﬂy concerned with the ﬁrst item in the above list, more
precisely with its second subitem. Thus, we will not attempt to create a feedback loop
from the electrons to the external sources; however, it should be clear that such a feedback
loop is easily achieved once the problem of how the N electrons interact mutually is solved
consistently — by simply abandoning the somewhat arbitrary split of the “material” world

3

into the system of N electrons and everything else (the external sources), treating the whole
as a single system. Item two, while perhaps the most important one as emphasized by
Bell [5], will not be addressed here; yet, see [8, 9, 10, 11]. We will not address item three
either.

Now, as for the question of how to obtain a consistent interacting theory of electrons
and ﬁelds, the nice thing about taking a de Broglie-Bohm perspective, besides avoiding the
measurement problem, is that an obvious candidate for such a consistent model suggests
itself: at the ﬁrst-quantized level discussed here, the electric and magnetic potentials φ and
A in (4) should not be considered as created only “externally” (not a sharp notion anyhow)
but instead as being the potentials for the total classical ﬁelds. Thus, the potentials φ
and A then solve (5), (6), (7), with total charge and current densities given by ρel(x, t) =
N
ρext
k=1 ˙qk(t)δqk(t)(x), respectively,
el (x, t)
and with particle velocities ˙qk given by the de Broglie-Bohm guiding law (1). Conceptually

We now have inherited the problems with inﬁnite self-energies and self-forces that

At this point, we will follow the classical example of Abraham [15] and replace the
point charges with extended charges. Thus we obtain a quantum Abraham model of
electrodynamics (see Appendix A.3 in [16] and [17] for modern discussions of classical
Abraham models.) The introduction of this model and the discussion of some of its
salient features will consume the main part of this paper. Yet, the main objective of this
paper is to convey some interesting lessons to be learned from contemplating this model.
I end this introduction with a dedication to GianCarlo Ghirardi, who’s quest for a
rational understanding of quantum physics has led him to develop, jointly with A. Rim-
ini and T. Weber, their spontaneous localization theory [1] which, together with the de
Broglie-Bohm theory, is the only theory of quantum mechanics ﬁled in the reasonable cat-
egory by the philosopher H. Putnam [18]. With his successful pursuit of objective realistic
foundations of physics, GianCarlo has been an inspiration to all those scientists, especially
the younger ones, who have balked at the mainstream quantum physics education which
maintains that such a pursuit is futile. R. Tumulka’s [19] recent construction of the ﬁrst
Lorentz-invariant generalization of the Galilei-invariant GRW theory, for not mutually in-
teracting particles, speaks testament to my words. It gives me great pleasure to celebrate
GianCarlo’s 70th birthday with this small contribution that grew out of my own modest
attempts to understand the foundations of physics.

2 The Quantum Abraham models

2.1 Physical setting

In order to limit the scope of this article we formulate the models only for a neutral atom,
treating the nucleus in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as an inﬁnitely massive point
charge which is ﬁxed at the origin of an inertial frame. Hence, the nucleus is treated as
an external source, of magnitude N times the electron —charge—. In addition we admit
an applied magnetic ﬁeld, implemented through ﬁeld conditions “at inﬁnity.”

2.2 The kinematical electron according to Abraham

As in the pre-relativistic classical works of Abraham [15], a (bare) charge of each electron
R3 by a compactly supported
is now distributed around its instantaneous location qk(t)
ebfe with SO(3) symmetry in all states of motion in the
smooth bare charge density
R3 fe(x)d3x = 1. The k-th electron carries this
nucleus’ inertial frame, fe satisfying
charge density along rigidly with velocity ˙qk(t); it may also rotate rigidly around qk(t)
In addition the spherical electron will have a bare mass
with angular velocity ωk(t).
mb > 0, a bare moment of inertia Ib > 0, and a bare gyromagnetic ratio gb > 0 (gb = 2
in (4)).

In classical Abraham theory one can take eb = e, but in the quantum Abraham theory
= e. Moreover, in the original Abraham model mb = 0 and Ib = 0 —

with disastrous consequences; see Appendix A.3 in [16].

2.3 The basic equations

With charge and current densities ρel and jel thus deﬁned, the Maxwell wave equations
(6), (7) in Lorenz-Lorentz gauge become semi-relativistic Maxwell-Lorentz wave equations

The above set of equations comprises several models of quantum Abraham type. To
the best of my knowledge, none of these models has been discussed in the literature.
These models open up a new perspective on de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory, for the
following reason. In the conventional completely non-relativistic de Broglie-Bohm theory
of, say, an atom in an applied magnetic ﬁeld, the interaction terms are all prescribed
and the Pauli equation for the atomic electrons is a linear equation for ψ independent
of the evolution of the actual charges. Thus, while ψ guides their motion, there is no
feedback loop from the actual motion into the dynamics of ψ (which is just ﬁne). In the
quantum Abraham models, the motion of the actual charges, which is again guided by the
spinor wave function, inﬂuences the actual electromagnetic ﬁelds whose potentials enter
the Pauli equation. Thus there is a feedback loop from the motion of the actual particles
to the evolution of the wave function.2 Hence, the Pauli equation (16) for ψ is part of
2Lest the reader gets the impression that any Bohmian quantum theory that treats the inter-
actions between particles and ﬁelds consistently, rather than putting some of them in by hand,
would have to have a feedback loop from the actual particles to ψ, we emphasize that a diﬀerent
type of consistent theory is possible in which there is once again no inﬂuence of the actual particles
on ψ [10, 11].

a nonlinear system of dynamical equations. As a consequence, issues like interference
phenomena that seem to rely crucially on having a linear evolution of ψ have to be re-
evaluated in light of this novel structure. It should therefore be clear that the question,
“which one of the quantum Abraham models, if any, reproduces the physical phenomena
correctly?” is an interesting new problem, to which we turn next.

3 The de Broglie-Bohm version of the pre-standard

model of a not too large atom

3.1 Outline of the pre-standard model

When it comes to computing spectral lines of any atom with N > 1, but N not too big,
the nucleus assumed ﬁxed, (4) with its external potential φ being the Coulomb potential
of the nucleus gives decent quantitative agreement between experiments and computations
only for N = 1. However, if the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, if necessary the Breit-
Darwin relativistic correction to it, the spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings (see [23]) are
additionally put into the linear Pauli equation (4) by hand, a vastly improved quantitative
accuracy is achieved. We call this amended Pauli equation, coupled with (1) and either
(2) or (3), the de Broglie-Bohm version of the “pre-standard model” of a not too large
atom, in analogy to its “standard model” [24] which treats the electromagnetic radiation
ﬁeld as (second) quantized and which is also known as the Pauli-Fierz model or “non-
relativistic QED;” see [17] for a good survey. Of course, in the conventional (i.e. without
de Broglie-Bohm guiding law) pre-standard and standard models, contact with physical
reality is made through the obscure “measurement formalism.” It ought to be possible
to systematically derive the pre-standard model, the measurement formalism included,
from a consistent realistic quantum theory.
In this section we inquire into whether a
quantum Abraham theory of electrons and ﬁelds reduces to the pre-standard model in
the so-called adiabatic regime of gentle accelerations (and low speeds). Note that if such
a derivation is possible, it then also follows that at least in this adiabatic regime the
nonlinear evolution of the ψ of the quantum Abraham model will be compatible with
interference eﬀects normally thought to be a consequence of the linearity of the evolution
of ψ in the conventional Schr¨odinger and Pauli equations.

3.2 The spinless quantum Abraham model

To keep matters simple, but also because I know how to do the calculations for the
model with spin only for a system with a single electron and a ﬁxed nucleus (the Born-
Oppenheimer hydrogen), the many electrons model will now be considered in the version
with σk = (I, I, I)k, and with a guiding equation (12). Since then the spin indices are
reduced to a mere bookkeeping device, we actually ignore them (factor them out), treating
; of course, ψ is antisymmetric, but
ψ as just the Schr¨odinger wave function, i.e. ψ
the following does not need this input.

Next we proceed as if (17), (19) were a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the dynamics of
classical charged particles moving under the inﬂuence of self-consistently computed elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. Of course, the term ~2
2ρ1/2 in (17), the so-called “quantum

potential” [4], with ρ satisfying (18), makes it plain that we are not dealing with classi-
cal Hamilton-Jacobi theory, but this term does not change the thrust of the argument.
Namely, taking the time derivative of (19) we obtain the following pseudo-Newtonian

most thoroughly studied simpliﬁed model of semi-relativistic Lorentz electrodynamics. In
particular, we mention the recent rigorous treatments in [25, 26, 27], where for technical

The paper [26] addresses the long time asymptotics of a spinless particle with mb > 0,
and [27] studies the adiabatic regime of gentle accelerations. For us the important point is
the evaluation of the Lorentz force in this adiabatic regime, which is valid irrespectively of
how the particles come about to move gently (and, for us, slowly). Thus, in the adiabatic

purely electromagnetic Abraham model(s) in [15, 21, 28, 29, 30]. In [31] a “more conservative
position” is taken and the spinless Abraham model with bare mass considered. There it is also
left for the reader to discover (excercise 16.4) that stability of motion requires mb > 0; however,

3.2.5 Empirical equivalence over longer times?

Because we invoked continuity qualitatively, we cannot quantify how short “suﬃciently
short” really is. However, we will argue (nonrigorously) that, while the pairwise agreement
on R3N of Ψ ∼= (Φalt, ρalt) with (Φ|
ρ, ρ) is most likely restricted to times shorter than any
characteristic atomic time scale, the actual electron motions as computed from (47), (48)
and those computed from (17), (18), (19) in the adiabatic regime should nevertheless agree
well over much longer times!

1/2 ~
∇

As for the various wave functions, the problem is that, even though we know that
2ρ1/2 computed from (17), (18) the guiding equations (19) and (43) produce
given ρ−
(essentially) the same actual electron motions in the adiabatic regime (also for longer
times), the velocity ﬁelds on R3N which supply the r.h.s.’s of (19) and (43) will generally
not agree on all of R3N at later times even if they agree initially. The reason is simply
that for the (quantum Abraham) Hamilton-Jacobi equation (17) almost all generic points
in N particle conﬁguration space represent test (i.e. passive) particles in an environ-
ment produced by the N actual particles (and some external sources and the quantum
potential (ES-QP)), while for the more conventional Hamilton-Jacobi type equation (42)
each generic conﬁguration point represents N active generic particles interacting with each
other electrostatically (and otherwise with the same ES-QP) In other words, in the setup
(42), any single generic particle experiences the inﬂuence of N
1 other typically generic
but active particles plus the ES-QP, while in the setup (17) any single generic particle

−

13

typically experiences the inﬂuence of N other particles which are the actual ones, plus
the ES-QP, the exception occurring precisely when the N generic positions coincide with
the N actual ones — in which case the test particles are “upgraded” to active particles.
This signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the velocity ﬁelds on the generic conﬁguration points means
that not long after the initial instant of time the densities ρ and ρalt will begin to diﬀer.
It follows that the velocity ﬁeld on R3N which supplies the r.h.s. of (43) will soon diﬀer
from the one supplying the r.h.s. of (46) even though they agree initially, too. Thus, at
those times the velocity ﬁeld represented by the r.h.s. of (48) will begin to diﬀer from the
ones represented by (43) and by (19). An easy rule of thumb estimate is that in a typical
generic atomic conﬁguration signiﬁcant diﬀerences will develop in a fraction of a typical
orbital time in an atom.

2ρ1/2 and

And yet the actual motions as computed from (47), (48) should nevertheless continue
to agree with those computed from (17), (18), (19) in the adiabatic regime for much
longer times. To vindicate this extraordinary claim we note ﬁrst that from (36) and
the corresponding rewriting of (48) it follows that, in order to produce the same actual
ρalt need only agree along those trajectories. The
motions, ρ−
crucial observation now is that, despite the generic diﬀerences of the velocity ﬁelds on the
generic conﬁguration space computed with the upgraded test particles theory versus the
proper (interacting) particles theory, the smooth regularization of the point charges implies
that in the immediate vicinity of an actual position point of an atomic conﬁguration, a
1 other actual particles
test particle experiences predominantly the electric ﬁeld of the N
(plus the ES-QP), i.e. the situation resembles what happens in the proper particles theory
with conﬁgurations that basically agree with the actual ones. This conclusion is true for
typical atomic conﬁgurations when the mutual interparticle distance is about a Bohr radius
(or even only a tenth of it) while the size of the regularizing fe is smaller than that by as
much as a factor α2 in the spinless model, where α is Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure constant.
Of course, there is also the contribution from ρ versus the one from ρalt. But, a bootstrap
argument now reveals that, if initially the two densities ρ and ρalt agree and so do the
velocity ﬁelds computed with (47), (48) versus those computed from (17), (18), (19) in the
adiabatic regime, then in conﬁguration space there will exist a thin tubular region around
the actual trajectory computed from (17), (18), (19) in the adiabatic regime, which should
have a cross section size which is a fraction of the diameter of the support of fe, in which
the velocity ﬁeld corresponding to (19) and the density ρ continue to agree, respectively,
with the velocity ﬁeld corresponding to (46) and the density ρalt for a considerably longer
time than away from this tubular region.

−

Hence, as to its empirial output of actual particle motions, the spinless quantum Abra-
ham model in the adiabatic regime should make the same predictions as the de Broglie-
Bohm version of the spinless pre-standard model of a not too large atom over times much
longer than an atomic period. What the de Broglie-Bohm version of the spinless pre-
standard model achieves is a “parallel processing of all possibly actual motions which can
be computed with the quantum Abraham model, launched by an ensemble of possible
initial data,” the actual motion being selected a posteriori by the actually actual initial
data, while the quantum Abraham model requires the actual particle initial data (and
ﬁeld initial data, if we are not in the adiabatic regime) a priori, producing an ensemble of

14

test particle motions but only one actual motion “at a time”.

and jel = −eRe ψ†
ψ the real electric current vector density of the electron
ﬂuid. Since in their work there are then no true particles, the electromagnetic potentials are not
convoluted with fe; strangely, BST treat them as given, although logically the model should be,
and could easily be completed by computing the potentials self-consistently from (5) and (9),
(10) with the above ρel and jel as sources. The so completed BST model would simply become
what would go under the name classical Maxwell-Pauli equations (cf., the classical Maxwell-
Dirac equations [40]). This continuum analog of the quantum Abraham equations studied in this
paper is not known to describe the physics correctly; yet “second quantizing” these “classical
Maxwell-Pauli equations” yields “non-relativistic QED” [24] — formally, for these quantum ﬁeld
equations are UV and IR divergent without cutoﬀs. Of course, the ﬂuid ontology of the classical
Maxwell-Pauli equations disappears in this heuristic process of “second quantization.”

6Yet another possibility to deﬁne ωe is through the dynamics of the Euler angles at qe = qe(t).

e(x, t). We also remark that (73)
discrepancies show up proportional to the gradient of β6
will generally be false with more complicated applied electric ﬁelds.

Coming now to the self-ﬁelds, they do vary appreciably over the support of fe and we
cannot employ the above Taylor series expansion to these ﬁelds. Instead we need to invoke
the expansion of the Li´enard-Wiechert solutions in a Taylor series of the retarded time
about the current instant t, see [17, 30]. For the Abraham model with spin that was done
in great detail in [42], and for the classical limit of the quantum Abraham model with
spin the computation can be done accordingly. In either case one can show that the ﬁrst
non-vanishing contribution comes with the second order time derivative of the retarded
time. However, the contribution is quite complicated in each setting and we refrain from
elaborating on it in any detail. We note that part of the complication is due to the semi-
relativistic setting of the models; see [16] and [17] for computing self-contributions in the
relativistic Lorentz model. In any event, the main point is that in both models there now
arises a magnetic contribution to the electron’s mass and to its moment of inertia.

Next one multiplies (75) and (77) by mb/m to get the empirical electron mass m rather
than mb to appear in the generalized quantum potential terms, and demands that the
remaining coeﬃcients all take their empirical values. Recalling that the electromagnetic
ﬁelds ε, β and potentials ϕ, a generated by the bare charges scale proportional to eb, we
now obtain the following system of renormalization equations for the bare parameters,

by demanding that the bare mass is distributed by a positive density fm = fe, in which
case Ib ∝

that the remaining bare parameters mb, eb, gb and ω can be solved for (involving fe) in

4 Closing remarks

While certainly not proven rigorously, the results presented in this paper suggest quite
strongly the empirical equivalence of the pre-standard model of not too large atoms with
some nonlinear quantum Abraham model in which there is a feedback loop from the
actual electron motions to the wave equation. This is somewhat surprising at ﬁrst, but
if proven rigorously (if that is possible) it would shed an interesting new light on the
possible meanings of wave functions. The wave function in a quantum Abraham model
governs an ensemble indexed by initial positions, not of possible actual particles as in the
(pre-)standard model, but of test particles — one and only one conﬁguration of which
coinciding with the actual particle conﬁguration. Yet in terms of the actual dynamics its
active guiding role is the same as in the conventional setting.

Another interesting lesson learned is that contrary to widespread folklore it seems
that one can picture an electron as a “charged spinning miniature billiard ball” quite well
in non-relativistic quantum theory, at least for the hydrogenic problem. The two main
reasons usually oﬀered for why this feat should be impossible are: (i) Lorentz’ classical
calculation that such an electron would have to spin with about 10 times the speed of
light at its equator to produce a magnetic moment of the size of the Bohr magneton, and
(ii) the “classically indescribable two-valuedness” of spin, see [43]. However, as to (i),
Lorentz’ calculation assumed mb = 0 and Ib = 0 at the outset, which was shown in [16]
to be inconsistent — with mb > 0 and Ib > 0 there is no superluminal rotation speed;
and as to (ii), the de Broglie-Bohm perspective teaches us that the “two-valuedness” is a
matter of the law of motion, not any intrinsic particle property.

I end with the disclaimer that I am not at all suggesting that the electron were a
spinning miniature billiard ball. In fact, I believe [10, 11] that there are very good reasons
to try to construct a theory with point electrons, among them absence of empirical evidence
to the contrary and logical simplicity. In this vein the old ideas of Abraham and Lorentz,
when combined with those of de Broglie and Bohm, go a long way teaching us what kind
In particular, aiming for a theory with point
of theoretical models are possible at all.

electrons, one might want to think of fe just as a mathematical regularizer rather than
representing a physical quality of the electron, but as such it should be removed in a
δ. However, precisely this is not possible because there is no such thing as
limit fe →
negative bare mass for a quantum Abraham model. To make a consistent theory with
point electrons and ﬁelds one has to try something else, as done in [10, 11].

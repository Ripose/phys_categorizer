Atomic two-photon J=0 ↔J’=1 transitions are forbidden
for photons of the same energy. This selection rule is related
to the fact that photons obey Bose-Einstein statistics. We
have searched for small violations of this selection rule in the
6s2 1S0 + 2γ → 5d6d 3S1 transition in atomic barium. We
set a limit on the probability v that photons are in exchange-
antisymmetric states: v < 7 · 10−8.

Several recent experimental papers have explored the
possibility of small violations of the usual relationship
between spin and statistics [1–5]. Although such vio-
lations are not possible within the framework of con-
ventional quantum ﬁeld theory [6], motivations for con-
sidering them have been discussed in, e.g., Ref. [7].
If
photons do not obey Bose-Einstein statistics, there will
be a non-zero probability that two photons are in an
exchange-antisymmetric state. Here we report the results
of a search for such states, which is based on a selection
rule [8,9], which forbids two-photon transitions between
atomic states with J = 0 and J ′ = 1 for photons of equal
energy (degenerate two-photon transitions).

Consider the excitation amplitude for a J = 0 → J ′ =
1 two-photon transition. From S-matrix theory, this am-
plitude is a scalar which must contain the polarization
vectors e1 and e2 of the photons, the polarization vector
ev describing the J ′ = 1 state, and an arbitrary power of
the photon momenta k1 and k2. For E1-E1 type transi-
tions, the amplitude must in fact be independent of the
direction of the k-vectors. In this case, only one form of
the amplitude is possible:

A ∝ [(e1 × e2) · ev],

(1)

If pho-
which requires orthogonally-polarized photons.
tons obey Bose-Einstein statistics, this amplitude must
be invariant under e1 ↔ e2. The amplitude (1) does not
satisfy this condition, and must vanish if photons behave
as normally expected. This argument can be readily gen-
eralized to include transitions with higher multipolarity
[10]. For the case of counterpropagating photons (with
k2 = −k1), all possible amplitudes are odd under ex-
change of photon indices; this is known as the Landau-
Yang theorem [11]. We conﬁne ourselves to consideration
of amplitude (1), since other types of transitions are too
weak to be observed in the present experiment.

For ordinary photons, the two-photon transition rate

on resonance is [12]:

Here indices g, f , and n indicate ground, ﬁnal, and (vir-
tual) intermediate states of the transition; e1(2) is the
light polarization;

light intensity at frequency Ω1(2); ωij are frequencies of
atomic transitions; δ is the Dirac delta function; d is
the dipole operator; and the subscripts a and b refer to
Cartesian components. Consistent with our experimen-
tal conditions, we have neglected Doppler and natural
widths compared to the laser spectral widths.

For a J = 0 → J ′ = 1 transition, only the irreducible
rank-1 component of Qab can contribute to the matrix
element [8,9]. Thus

Eqn.(4) shows explicitly that degenerate transitions
(with Ω1 = Ω2) are forbidden. It is also easily seen that
the transition amplitude e1ae2bhf |Qab|gi has the form of
the rotational invariant in Eqn. (1).

We now generalize these results to allow for violation
of Bose-Einstein statistics. Permutation symmetry for
photons is reﬂected in the plus sign between the two
terms in Eqn.
(3). We thus construct similar quanti-
ties with a minus sign between the terms to obtain the
”Bose-Violating” two-photon operator:

where v is the Bose-Einstein statistics violation param-
eter, i.e., the probability to ﬁnd two photons in an an-
tisymmetric state. Here we explicitly include the fact
that the ”normal” and the ”Bose-violating” amplitudes
cannot interfere with each other [13].

Recently, theoretical discussion of possible small vio-
lations of the spin-statistics relation has centered on the
so-called ”quon algebra,” which allows continuous trans-
formation from Bose to Fermi statistics [14]. This formal-
ism has been used previously to set limits on the devia-
tion of photons from Bose statistics. For instance, Fivel
calculated [15] that the existence of high-intensity lasers
sets a limit of v ≤ 10−12 (although this calculation has
been argued to be invalid [16]). Recently, it has been
shown that statistics deviations for photons and charged
particles are linked within the quon theory [17], so that
the very stringent limits on the deviations from Fermi
statistics for electrons [1] can be used to set a limit of
v ≤ 10−26. It has been shown that our heuristic argu-
ment above is indeed reproduced in the quon formalism:
if creation/annihilation operators for photons obey the
q-deformed commutation relations

[18]. Since q = 1 for ordinary
then in (6), v =
bosons, degenerate J = 0 → J ′ = 1 two-photon tran-
sition are allowed to the extent that photons exhibit a
deviation from Bose statistics. However, it is prudent
to point out that application of the quon formalism to
photons is questionable, since relativistic quon theories
exhibit nonlocal features [19]. The simple argument be-
hind our technique makes it possible to state limits on
v without reference to the quon theory. Using an argu-
ment similar to ours, it has been shown that a violation
of Bose statistics for photons would lead to the decay
Z → γγ [20]. However, only a modest limit v ≤ 1 can be
inferred, in part because Z has no direct coupling to pho-
tons. The result reported here represents the ﬁrst quan-
titative limit on the existence of exchange-antisymmetric
states for photons.

We look for the transition 6s2 1S0 + 2γ → 5d6d 3S1 in
atomic barium (see Fig. 1). This transition was chosen
because it has an unusually large amplitude for transi-
tions due to ”Bose-violating” photons (see below). A
schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 2.
Light from a dye laser is sent through a polarizing beam-
splitter to produce two beams with orthogonal linear po-
larizations. These beams counterpropagate through a
Ba vapor cell. The laser is tuned around λ = 549 nm,
corresponding to the required energy for the degenerate
two-photon transition. Population of the upper level is
detected by observing ﬂuorescence at λ = 436 nm, ac-
companying the decay 5d6d 3S1 → 6s6p 3P2. Excess
signal within a narrow tuning range of the laser wave-
length would indicate the presence of fermionic photons.

The sensitivity of the experiment is calibrated with the
same detection system, by using non-degenerate photons
1 = 566 nm, tunable) to drive
(λ
the same transition. As seen from Eqn. (6), the calibra-
tion requires measurement of laser intensities and spec-
tral widths, and also determination of the two-photon
operators Qab and QBV
ab at the appropriate frequencies.
The central region of the vapor cell was operated at
T ≈ 925 K, corresponding to P (Ba) ≈ 5 · 10−2 T orr.
The cell was ﬁlled with buﬀer gas (He, P ≈ 0.2 T orr).
The dye laser (with Fluorescein 548 dye) was pumped by
the second harmonic (532 nm) of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser.
Both dye and YAG lasers had pulse length ≈ 7 ns. A por-
tion of the 532 nm light was split oﬀ to excite the calibra-
tion transition. Fluorescence from the cell passed though
interference and color glass ﬁlters onto a photomultiplier,
whose output was ampliﬁed and sent to a gated photon
counter. Counts were recorded for 25 ns following the
laser pulse. The absolute dye laser frequency was de-
termined with a wavelength meter with an accuracy of
5 GHz and a reproducibility of 2.5 GHz.

Laser intensity was determined from separate measure-
ments of pulse energy and beam area. Pulse energy was
measured with both pyroelectric and thermopile detec-
tors. Linearity was veriﬁed by comparing measurements
with both detectors, and by varying beam energy with
calibrated neutral density ﬁlters. The uncertainty in rel-
ative energy measurements was ≈ 15%. For the degener-
ate transition, nearly equal energies of ≈ 1.5 mJ/pulse
were used in the counterpropagating beams. For the non-
degenerate calibration transition, the beam powers were
reduced to avoid saturation: 100 µJ/pulse at 566 nm
and 1µJ/pulse at 532 nm. Laser beam areas were de-
termined by scanning a pinhole/photodiode combination
through the beam in two orthogonal directions. The un-
certainty in each linear dimension was ≈ 25%. Beam
diameters were ≈ 2.5 mm at the vapor cell. Laser spec-
tral widths (averaged over many pulses) were determined
with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. These mea-
surements were cross-checked with atomic signals. For
the dye laser, we tuned through an allowed, degener-
ate two-photon transition in Ba. Using the known dye
laser bandwidth, we could then determine the YAG laser
bandwidth by tuning the dye laser through the calibra-
tion transition. We assign uncertainties of 20 − 30% to
the bandwidths to account for the range of values ob-
tained using the two methods. Both lasers had linewidths
of ≈ 3 GHz, large compared to the transition Doppler
widths (≈ 0.3 GHz). A typical scan through the non-
degenerate transition is shown in Fig. 3. The relatively
high laser power used for the forbidden transition can
lead to complications such as AC Stark shift and broad-
ening, higher-order nonlinear processes, etc., which are
not present at the lower powers normally used for the cal-
ibration transition. We checked for such eﬀects by study-
ing the calibration transition with varying dye laser pow-

sition is determined as follows. Atomic transition ener-
gies [22] ωgn and ωnf and dipole matrix elements [23,24]
hn|d|gi are known for all signiﬁcant intermediate states
|ni in the sums of Eqns.
(3) and (5). We measured
dipole matrix elements hf |d|ni by determining the total
decay rate and branching ratios of all decays from the
state 5d6d 3S1. The decay rate (25 ± 15 ns−1) was mea-
sured by recording the time evolution of ﬂuorescence from
this state on a digital storage oscilloscope. Branching ra-
tios were measured by observing ﬂuorescence through a
scanning monochromator. We ﬁnd that the sum over
intermediate states in Eqns. (3) and (5) is well approx-
imated by a single term, for both the degenerate and
non-degenerate transitions: the term corresponding to
the intermediate state |ni = 6s6p 1P1 has very small
energy denominators, and large dipole matrix elements
with both the initial and ﬁnal states. (In fact, this was
the reason we used this particular transition.)
In this
approximation, the matrix elements cancel in the ratio

and this quantity depends

only on accurately known atomic and photonic energies.

We estimate that the error in relative transition proba-
bilities due to this approximation is <

Data for the degenerate transition were taken in three
separate runs, shown in Fig. 4. The laser was scanned
around the nominal frequency of the degenerate transi-
tion. The signals were ﬁt with a constant background
plus a peak whose width was ﬁxed by the dye laser spec-
tral width. In all three runs, there is evidence for a sta-
tistically signiﬁcant peak above the background. The
center frequencies are consistent both with the predicted
position of the degenerate transition and with each other.
The observed resonances are consistent with those ex-
pected for purely bosonic photons, due to the ﬁnite band-
width of the dye laser. For light from a single laser
of ﬁnite spectral width (centered around ΩL = ωf g
2 ),
this transition probability does not vanish even though
Qab(Ω1, Ω2) = 0 for Ω1 = Ω2. From the known experi-
mental parameters, we can predict the size of the signal
peak due to this eﬀect. The uncertainty in the predic-
tion for each run (∼ 60%) was estimated by adding in
quadrature the various uncertainties in calibration pa-
rameters. The uncertainty in the size of the ﬁtted peaks
was 25 − 30% for each run. Averaging over all three runs
gives the result for the ratio of observed to predicted
transition probabilities:

Wgf (observed)
Wgf (predicted)

= 1.5 ± 0.6.

(8)

A violation of Bose-Einstein statistics would appear as
an excess signal above the predicted value. At the 90%
conﬁdence level (one-sided), Wgf (Bose−violating)
< 1.3.
From this and Eqn. (6), we derive a limit on the Bose-
Einstein statistics violation parameter for photons:

Wgf (predicted)

v < 7 · 10−8(90% c.l.).

(9)

We believe that this limit can be decreased by several
orders of magnitude with an improved apparatus. Such
an experiment is currently underway.

For the forbidden transition, the dye laser is tuned around
549 nm, and the ﬂip-up mirror is in place as shown, so each
of the counterpropagating beams in the vapor cell originates
from the dye laser. For the calibration transition, the dye
laser is tuned to 566 nm and the ﬂip-up mirror is removed.
The beam entering the vapor cell from the left then originates
from the dye laser (566 nm), while the beam entering from
the right originates from the Nd:YAG laser (532 nm).

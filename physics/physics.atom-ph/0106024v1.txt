Abstract

We consider a ﬁxed number of noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap.
The determination of the exact microcanonical ground state number ﬂuctua-
tion is a diﬃcult enterprise. There have been several theoretical attempts to
solve this problem approximately, especially in 1D models where analytic re-
sults were found using some asymptotic formulae from number theory. Here,
we obtain the exact number ﬂuctuation curves, and show that these exact
curves are substantially diﬀerent from the results presented in literature for
small particle number and ﬁnite temperature. Further, we show how these
approximate microcanonical results may be derived using a canonical ther-
modynamics approach.

I. INTRODUCTION

As is well known, the traditional approach of determining the ﬂuctuation of single-
particle occupation numbers fails for bosons as the temperature T
0. It predicts that the
ﬂuctuation tends to inﬁnity in this limit, rather than zero as described by a real system.
After the experimental success in producing Bose-Einstein condensation of trapped alkali-
metal atoms, there is renewed interest in calculating the number ﬂuctuation using either
canonical or microcanonical ensemble approach [1–7]. Most of these, however, use some
forms of approximation to the real microcanonical ﬂuctuation. In [4] the authors deﬁne the
so-called Maxwell’s Demon ensemble, and calculate the microcanonical ﬂuctuation for a 3D
In [7] we formulated a method of calculating the exact microcanonical
trap numerically.
ﬂuctuation using combinatorics for a perfectly isolated BEC with ﬁnite number of particles
which, to our best knowledge, has not been presented before.

→

In this report we focus on a system of bosons in an one-dimensional harmonic trap. The
number ﬂuctuation of this system was calculated by the authors in [1], using the well-known
asymptotic formulae from number theory to approximate the exact expansion coeﬃcients
of the N-particle partition function. Their method yields results which were supposed to
be microcanonical. However, we shall show in this brief report that their approximate
method yields the same results one obtains from canonical ensemble averaging, or a related
formulation by Parvan et al [11]. At low temperatures and for ﬁnite number of particles (N
≤
100), these results are very diﬀerent from the ones calculated using the exact combinatorics
method.

The layout of this paper is as follows.

In section II we establish the notations and
outline the method of calculating the exact ground state number ﬂuctuation [2,7,8]. Section
III contains the main focus of this brief report in which we derive the results of [1] using
thermodynamics, and show that they agree with the ones obtained from canonical method
as given by [11]. Finally, we compare the exact combinatorics results from section II and
the canonical results from section III.

II. MICROCANONICAL FORMALISM

We consider an isolated system with discreet energy levels consisting of N particles in the
ground state at zero temperature. Given an excitation energy E, there can be one particle
which absorbs all the energy and gets excited to an excited state, or two particles which share
the available energy...etc. The number of excited particles Nex can be somewhere between
1 and N, depending on the excitation quanta, such that the total number of particles N
remain constant. This deﬁnes the microcanonical ground state number ﬂuctuation. Denote
ω(E, Nex, N) to be the number of possible ways of distributing E among exactly Nex particles,
then the probability of exciting exactly Nex particles in a N-particle system at excitation
energy E is given by [7,8]:

P (E, Nex, N) =

ω(E, Nex, N)
N
Nex=1 ω(E, Nex, N)

Expression (1) is normalized and has the following properties:

The number of particles in the ground state N0 and the excited states Nex are related via
N = N0 + Nex. N0 and Nex are allowed to vary while N is ﬁxed so that the number
ﬂuctuation from the ground state is given by:

Expression (6) is true in general regardless of the ensemble and statistics of the particles.

Next, we specialize to a one-dimensional harmonic trap. Let us put ¯hω = 1, then the
excitation energy from the ground state is E = n. The partition function of the system is
well-known

The coeﬃcients Ω(n, N) is the number of partitions of n which have at most N summands.
For example, if n = 5 and N = 4, then Ω(5, 4) = 6 since 5 = 5, 1 + 4, 2 + 3, 1 + 1 + 3, 1 +
2 + 2, 1 + 1 + 1 + 2. In connection to our system, Ω(n, N) is interpreted as the number of
possible ways to distribute n quanta among utmost N particles. Clearly,

Ω(n, N) =

ω(E, Nex, N)

While the coeﬃcients Ω(n, N) may be found analytically by expanding ZN (β) in series,
the exact determination of the microstate ω(E, Nex, N) is a diﬃcult problem. We may
ﬁnd ω(E, Nex, N) using combinatorics as described in detail in [7], or, alternatively, use the
well-known identity [2]

ω(n, Nex, N) = Ω(n, Nex)

III. CANONICAL FORMALISM

The ground state number ﬂuctuation may in general be expressed in terms of the mo-

ments of occupation numbers as [10,11,8]:

The sum runs through all the allowed k values in the ground state deﬁned at zero tempera-
ture. For bosons, only k = 0 state applies. Canonically, the moments are given by:

We can also obtain the canonical ﬂuctuation using a thermodynamics approach [7]. Given

the N-particle partition function (8), the entropy of the system reads

Note that the canonical multiplicity Ω(β, N) by deﬁnition is given by:

Ω(β, N) = exp[SN (β)] = x−EZN (β)

Compare (16) with (9), we see that the canonical multiplicity is a one-term approximation to
the exact value of the expansion coeﬃcients of the series (9). To make a direct comparison
with the results given in [1], we approximate the sums in (15). The ﬁrst term gives the

This is identical to expression (14) given in ref. [1] which the authors claim give the mi-
crocanonical ﬂuctuation. That the canonical method given by (12), (13), and (14) and
the above method are equivalent is shown in Fig. (1) [7]. Both yield the same canonical
ﬂuctuations.

IV. MICROCANONICAL VS. CANONICAL

Fig. (2) compares the relative ﬂuctuations for N = 10, 50, 100 particles. The respective
curves of both ensembles tend to agree as N and n get large (ie. thermodynamic limit),
otherwise the results are very diﬀerent.

It is clear from the discussion above that the method employed by the authors in ref. [1]
yields canonical results. Comparison between their method and the thermodynamics method
makes it clear on why this is so: both use what essentially is a saddle point approximation to
the exact multiplicity Ω(n, N) (pN (m) in their notation) from the series (8). Only when the
multiplicity found exactly are the results microcanonical. This clearly makes it more diﬃcult
to incorporate interaction, and treat the true condensate ﬂuctuations of weakly interacting
isolated bosons microcanonically.

ABSTRACT

The hyperspherical harmonics (HH) provide a complete basis for the expansion of
atomic wave functions, but even for two particles the number of harmonics for a given
order is not trivial and, as the number of electrons increases, this degeneracy becomes
absolutely prohibitive. We modify the method by selecting a subset of the basis that,
we feel, will yield the physically most important part of the wave function, and test
the idea on simple systems.

In a previous work (with M. Haftel) of the ground and ﬁrst excited 1S0 states of
the helium atom we found that the error in the binding energy of the 1S0 ground state
was of the order of 1 part in 104 and that it decreased for the ﬁrst excited state.

We now have applied our method to the equivalent triplet 3S1 states. We report
on this work, and our results, and hope to draw attention to the interesting accuracy
that we obtain with the relatively simple wave functions of our formulation.

Introduction

The bound states of the helium atom have been studied by using several methods.
The most accurate results have been achieved by variational calculations where the
states are described by wave functions which include more than 200 parameters [1].
Other, more recent, calculations have been performed using expansions in hyperspher-
ical harmonics (HH), where the convergence was speeded up by the introduction of a
correlation factor describing the average behaviour of the wave function at short and
long ranges[2]. The residual part of the wave function was expanded in HH. This leads
to an accuracy of about nine ﬁgures in the binding energy, but with a nonuniform
convergence as the number of HH is increased.

In our approach to the many body problem, we select the HH occurring in the wave
function by following a scheme in which the basis elements are introduced according
to the degree of complexity of the correlations that they describe.

In the ﬁrst approximation, a HH of minimal degree (because of the Pauli princi-
ple) deﬁnes the state. In the next approximation, terms will appear in our equations
consisting of the product of the HH of minimal degree and the potential. The basis el-
ements that can correctly reproduce these terms form our Potential Harmonic basis[3],
which we use in this work. A further approximation would be obtained by applying
the potential to the wave function, including the correlations already obtained from
the previous order and by taking into account the new basis elements generated by this
product.

In the analysis of the ground and ﬁrst excited 1S0 state of the helium atom [4], what
was studied was the accuracy obtained by using the PH basis. The resulting expansion
of the wave function provides a simple structure where one and two body contributions
are exactly separated. It leads to a simple description of the wave function.

We found that the error in our calculation of the binding energy of the 1S0 ground

state was of the order of 10−

4 and decreased for the ﬁrst excited state.

Our purpose, then, in this paper was to study the worth of the method for triplet
3S1 states. Since the potential basis is complete in so far as describing the independent
motion of the electrons (i.e. when the interaction between the electrons is neglected),
the missing energy must come from the Coulomb interaction between the two electrons.
In the 1S0 state this interaction is maximum at short distances and is expected to be
larger in the space symmetric 1S0 states than in the space anti-symmetric 3S1 states,
where the eﬀect of this interaction damps out at small distances where the wave function
goes to zero. We were therefore very hopeful that our method would be even more
satisfactory for the triplet than for the singlet.

Formalism

In the HH expansion method the coordinates are expressed in polar form in a
D-dimensional space where D = 3N is the number of independent space degrees of
freedom. N = 2 for two electrons with position vectors ~x1 and ~x2, relative to the nucleus
with nuclear charge Z and polar coordinates (ri, ~ωi), i = 1, 2, where the ~ωi denote the
two standard angle measures for the ith electron, the hyperspherical coordinates (r, Ω)
1 + r2
r2
are chosen to be the hyperradius r =
2 and the set Ω of ﬁve angular coordinates,
~ω1, ~ω2 and z, where r1 = r cos φ, r2 = r sin φ and we replace φ by

Also, the Hamiltonian in (3) is an even function of z and therefore the wave function
can have a deﬁnite z-parity. The z-parity is associated, according to (1), with the
parity in the exchange of the two electrons, i.e. it is even for the singlet 1S0 states and
odd for the triplet 3S1 states.

When the interaction between the electrons is set to zero, equation (3) is separable
and the wave function for S-states can be written either as a product of individual
wave functions

12 is given by (16) in terms of r, z and x = cos θ. Rather than try to solve this
system of coupled two-variable second order partial diﬀerential equations to atomic
accuracy, we expand Φ(r, z, x) in hyperspherical harmonics. To then solve exactly
equations (18) requires the complete Zernike-Brinkman basis [5] HE for two particles
in S-states, i.e. a basis complete in the variable z for each value of ℓ in the expansion
(17). This would lead us to a large number of coupled equations (9) to be solved for
a given accuracy and we try to reduce the size of the basis and choose the potential
basis.

This basis consists of: (i) the basis for ℓ = 0 which is complete for an expansion
of any function of z only (in particular of the potential r−

2 ), and (ii) the basis
needed for a complete expansion of r−
12 . This implies that equation (3) can then be
solved with a harmonic expansion which includes only two orthogonal elements for each
grand orbital L = 2k, except when L = 0.

The PH approximation selects the partial waves in expansion (8) which are coupled
to the largest components, L = 0 (L = 2), of the 1S0 (3S1) ground states of the wave
function respectively. We call this the optimal subset.

In order to extract this subset, we introduce the kinematic rotation vector ~R(ϕ) =
~r1 cos ϕ + ~r2 sin ϕ, with parameter ϕ, where ~R(0) = ~r1, ~R(π/2) = ~r2, ~R(3π/4) =

Results and Analysis

The r dependence of the coupling matrix is simply 1/r (i.e. multiplying a matrix
of constant coeﬃcients). To solve the resulting coupled diﬀerential equations, we take
advantage of a method developed by V. Mandelzweig and M. Haftel[2] - and embodied
in one of their numerical programs. It was used by Haftel and us (here, Fabre and
Larsen) to obtain results for the singlet[4]. Michael kindly made available to us his
program, that we used for the triplet.

Its essence is to calculate the wavefunction and its logarithmic derivative by using
expansions - and, then, obtain the matrices of coeﬃcients (of these expansions) by
numerical recursions.

We solve the set of equations for a number of values of kmax, such as 33, 37, 41 ...
and extrapolate the result to inﬁnite order. We can compare our results to a wealth of
reliable data[1, 6].

Singlet

As noted above, the results have been published[4]. The result for the ground state is
that we obtained an extrapolated value of 2.903471 atomic units, compared to the more
accurate variational result of 2.903724. (We truncate all our numbers to 6 decimals.)
The error was thus

.01%.

For the excited state, the extrapolated value was 2.145825 compared with a varia-

∼

tional value of 2.145974. The resulting error was thus

.007%.

These were based on calculations for kmax = 24, 28, 32, 36 and noting[7] that, asymp-
totically, the diﬀerences between the energies for successively larger values of kmax de-
4
crease at least as fast as k−
max. The diﬀerences were then ﬁtted to an inverse polynomial:

∼

∆E(k) = E(k)

E(k

4) =

−

−

1
k2(A + B k + C k2)

and the extrapolated values were obtained by adding the remaining contributions that
would result from summing to inﬁnity.

Another point has, in retrospect, proved important. For the ground state, the
value for kmax = 36 is 2.903067, i.e. this ‘raw’ results is already correct to 4 digits. The
extrapolated ‘tail’ only adds a modest amount. For the excited state, the situation is
quite diﬀerent. The ‘raw’ value is 2.129457 and we see that therefore the diﬀerence
between the resulting energy and the correct value is, roughly, 1%. The contribution
of the extrapolated ‘tail’ is very important yielding several more digits in agreement.

Triplet

In Table 1, we present the numerical results (in a.u.) obtained by solving the coupled
equations. These need, again, to be extrapolated, so as to take into account the
contribution of the higher order potential harmonics, and then compared with good
variational estimates: 2.1752495 for the lowest state, 2.068685 for the excited state.
Without the r12 interaction, the exact result is 2.5 a.u.

The ﬁrst thing that we notice, then, is that, even for the much higher values of kmax
that we have used for the triplet, the diﬀerence between our results and the variational
ones is still more than 1 part in a thousand for the ground state and 1% for the higher
state. If we had limited ourselves to the orders used in the singlet, our errors would
have been 1/2% and 3%, respectively!

We were thus driven to higher values of kmax and thus to a greater number of states
in the calculations. For example, a kmax of 61 corresponds to a total number of states
of 91. Even then, we also had to work harder at the extrapolation than we did for the
singlet. The diﬀerences were ﬁtted to an inverse polynomial with more coeﬃcients:

∆E(k) =

1
A k4 + B k3 + C k2 + D k + E

with the ∆s variously deﬁned as ∆E(k) = E(k)
2)
and the extrapolated values obtained by using this ﬁt, for the diﬀerences, to obtain the
higher order contributions.

Examination of the results of the extrapolations then shows that the best strategy
consists in ﬁtting the coeﬃcients with the minimum of data points, taken at the highest
values of kmax. For the ground state, the use of ∆(k) = 4 yields the best result. For
the excited state, ∆(k) = 2, is superior.

Thus we ﬁnd that for the ground state, the use of the set of values of kmax:
(51,53,55,57,59,61) yields 2.175042, while (41,45,49,53,57,61) gives us our best result
2.175144 (both results, here, rounded to 6 decimal places). We recall that this must
be compared with 2.1752495.

For the excited case, (55,57,59,61,63,67) gives 2.068704, while (47,51,55,59,63,67)

gives 2.068757, also rounded at the same place. We compare this with 2.068685.

Since in our method we only approximate by truncating the basis, both the elements
which appear in it and the highest order that we take into account in our calculations,
our results must obey the variational principle and must yield upper bounds in the
(negative) energies of the states. We can verify that this is indeed the case for our
”raw” results, displayed in Table 1. For the extrapolated results, this is only evident
for the ground state. Our results for the excited state are slightly deeper than the
correct energy.

This is an artifact of the extrapolation. Clearly, our inverse polynomial only im-
perfectly represents the correct asymptotic behaviour of the diﬀerences. In fact taking
diﬀerent sets of points, from which to extrapolate, and trying to ‘see’ trend lines, we
think that we see oscillations and certainly instability and serious limitations in our
ability to extrapolate.

Nevertheless, we obtain energies to within 1 or 2 parts in 20, 000 for the lowest state

and 1 to a few parts in 100, 000 for the excited state.

Finally, we note an extrapolation with ∆(k) of 2, for the case where the electrons are
uncoupled. Our result is then 2.499999995, rounded to nine decimal places, compared
to the exact value of 2.5 In this case our basis is complete, aside from truncation in
the order, and we take this result as a conﬁrmation of the soundness of our numerical
approach and procedures.

Conclusion

We believe that we have demonstrated that the use of Potential Harmonics is a
sound way of obtaining reliable results, at least for 2-electron atoms, to an accuracy
of 1 part in 104 or 105. Our aim was to conﬁrm this, with our ﬁrst two calculations,
and then to proceed with higher excited states for these 2-electron atoms and, perhaps
more excitingly, with 3-electron atoms!

While this is probably feasible, and in fact the potential harmonics seem to yield
better accuracy for the excited states as 3-body and higher correlations become less
important, our experience leads us to the following caveat.

We have found many aspects of our eﬀort, such as the calculation of our matrix
elements, the necessary extrapolations, to be quite delicate! We would prefer other
methods which, using integral equations, would not require them.

Our ﬁnal and best thought, then, is to draw attention to the simplicity of the form
of the wave functions that we have used, and to the fact that, in them, the pairs are,
each, in an s-state.

The matrix elements in equations (22) and (23), after making the potential harmonics
basis substitution, take the form of integrals of products of three Gegenbauer polyno-
mials. Let us introduce a number of expressions for sums that occur from particular

The matrix elements

where k and k′ are both odd because of the anti-symmetric requirement of the triplet

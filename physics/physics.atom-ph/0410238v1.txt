Abstract

In previous publications dressed coordinates and dressed states has been intro-

duced in linear systems. Speciﬁcally, a system composed by a harmonic oscillator

interacting linearly with an inﬁnity set of other oscillators has been treated. In this

paper we show how to generalize such dressed coordinates and dressed states to a

nonlinear version of this system. Also we clarify some misunderstandings about the

concept of dressed coordinates.

Indeed now we prefer to call them renormalized

coordinates to emphasize the analogy with the renormalized ﬁelds in quantum ﬁeld

theory.

1 Introduction

In recent publications it has been introduced the concept of dressed coordinates and

dressed states[1, 2, 3, 4], in the context of a harmonic oscillator (the atom) interacting

linearly with a massless scalar ﬁeld. This allowed the construction of dressed states, with

the physically correct property of stability of the oscillator ground state in the absence of

ﬁeld quanta (the quantum vacuum). For a review see the next section. Also this formalism

allowed a nonperturbative treatment of the oscillator radiation process. When applied to

a conﬁned atom (approximated by the oscillator) in a spherical cavity of suﬃciently small

diameter the method accounts for the experimentally observed inhibition of the decaying

processes [5, 6].

In Ref.

[7] an attempt to construct dressed coordinates and dressed states for a

nonlinear system has been done. However the approach used there was more intuitive

than formal. The purpose of this paper is to develop a formal method to construct

dressed coordinates in nonlinear systems. We will do this by a perturbative expansion in

the nonlinear coupling constant. To be speciﬁc we consider the model with Hamiltonian

given by,

The sextic nonlinear interaction will be considered mainly because for some values of λr

and αr it is possible to ﬁnd the exact solution for the ground state and, as explained at the

end of section III, this fact will permit an exact construction of the dressed coordinates.

Then, this sextic model will allow us to test the validity of the strategy developed to

obtain the dressed coordinates in a general nonlinear system.

Along this paper we use natural units c = ¯h = 1.

2 Deﬁning dressed (renormalized) coordinates and

dressed states

The purpose od this section is twofold. First, to make this paper self contained we review

what was called dressed coordinates and dressed states in the Refs. [1, 2, 3]. Second, we

clarify some misunderstandings about the concept of dressed coordinates, as we explain

below. Indeed now we prefer to call them renormalized coordinates to emphasize that

these coordinates are analogous to the renormalized ﬁelds in quantum ﬁeld theory.

To understand the necessity of introducing dressed coordinates and dressed states let

us consider the following problem. Imagine that the oscillator with index zero in Eq. (1)

represents an atom and the other oscillators represent the modes of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld. If there are no interaction among them the free Hamiltonian (ck = λr = αr = 0)

has the following eigenfunctions,

=

where

The physical meaning of ψn0n1...nN (q) in this case is clear, it represents the atom in its n0-
th excited level and nk photons of frequencies ωk. Now, consider the state of no photons,
ψn00...0(q): the excited atom in the quantum vacuum. We know from experience that
any excited level of the atom is unstable, that is, the state ψn00...0(q) is unstable. The
explanation of this fact is that the atom is not isolated from interacting with the quantum

electromagnetic ﬁeld, or in other words it is rendered unstable by interacting with the

quantum vacuum. This interaction in our model is given by the linear and nonlinear

couplings of q0 with qk. Obviously, when we take into account these interactions any state
of the type ψn00...0(q) will be unstable, since these states are not eigenfunctions of the total
interacting Hamiltonian. But, there is a problem, the state ψ00...0(q), that represents the

atom in its ground state and no photons, is also unstable contradicting the experimental

fact of the stability of the ground state in the absence of photons. What is wrong in all

this? The ﬁrst thing that cames in our mind is to think that the model given by Eq. (1)

is wrong. Certainly, we know that the correct theory to describe this physical system is

quantum electrodynamics. On the other hand such a description of this system could be

extremely complicated. If we aim to maintain the model as simple as possible and still

insist in describing it by the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) what we can do in order to

take into account the stability of the ground state? The answer lies in the spirit of the

renormalization program in quantum ﬁel theory: the coordinates qµ that appear in the

Hamiltonian given by Eq. (1) are not the physical ones, they are bare coordinates. We
introduce renormalized coordinates, q′

k, respectively for the dressed atom and the
dressed photons. We deﬁne these coordinates as the physically meaningful ones. These

0 and q′

renormalized coordinates were called in prededing works as dressed coordinates [1, 2, 3],

for this reason, from now on we will take these denominations as synonymous. In terms

of these dressed coordinates we deﬁne dressed states as

ψn0n1...nN (q′)

The dressed states given by Eq. (5) are deﬁned as the physically measurable states and

describe in general, the physical atom in the n0-th excited level and nk physical photons of

frequency ωk. Obviously, in the limit in which the coupling constants ck, λr and αr vanish
the renormalized coordinates q′
µ approach the bare coordinates qµ. Now, in order to relate
the bare and dressed coordinates we have to use the physical requirement of stability of

the dressed ground state. The dressed ground state will be stable only and only if it is

deﬁned as the eigenfunction of the interacting Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1). Also the

dressed ground state must be the one of minimum energy, that is, it must be deﬁned

as being identical (or proportional) to the ground state eigenfunction of the interacting

Hamiltonian. From this deﬁnition, one can construct the dressed coordinates in terms of

the bare ones.

from Eq. (1) by setting λr = αr = 0,

Firstly we explicitly construct the dressed coordinates for the linear model obtained

Although the task of constructing dressed coordinates in linear systems has been done in

preceding works, we repeat here the calculation in order to make this paper self contained.

In the next section we will consider the nonlinear case. As is well know, the Hamilto-

nian (7) can be diagonalized by means of the introduction of normal coordinates Qr and

momenta Pr, deﬁned as

not remain stable. For example the ﬁrst excited dressed state, whose eigenfunction is

We have to remark here that the dressed coordinates here introduced are not simply

a change of variables, they are new coordinates in its own right and are introduced by

physical consistence requirement of the model. Also we have to stress that our dressed

coordinates are not the same as the ones employed in other references, as for example

in [12] and references therein, where the authors called dressed coordinates the collective

normal ones. Also our dressed states are very diﬀerent from the ones deﬁned in Refs.

[13, 14, 15, 16], where the authors called dressed states the states obtained by diagonalizing

a truncated ﬁnite matrix representation of the Hamiltonian.

3 Constructing renormalized coordinates in a non-

linear model

Now we are ready to construct dressed coordinates and dressed states in the nonlinear

model given by Eq. (1). For this purpose we have to ﬁnd, ﬁrstly, the eigenfunctions of

this Hamiltonian, in particular its ground state eigenfunction.

In order to maintain things as simple as possible and to compare with the the preceding

treatment given in Ref. [7], we consider the nonlinear quartic interaction obtained from

the model given described in Eq. (1) by setting αr = 0. Following Ref. [7] we make the

simplest choice for the coeﬃcients

(r)
µνρσ as

that is, we obtain a system of uncoupled quartic anharmonic oscillators. In Eq. (21) we
can notice that λr has dimension of [f requency]3. Then we write λr = λΩ3
r, where λ is
a dimensionless coupling constant. The eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian given by Eq.

Before leaving this section we would like to comment why we factored the term
0 (0) in Eq. (27). Notice that we deﬁne the dressed coordinates q′

of the proportionality ψ00...0(q′)
equality we have to take care in deﬁning a well behaved transformation between dressed

µ by means
φ00...0(Q; λ). To promote this proportionality into an

and collective coordinates, for example it would be undesirable any singular transforma-

tion. To see how the above undesirable situation occurs, deﬁne the dressed coordinates

through Eq. (26) without the factorization of the term 1 +

Since G(1)

0 (ξr) are not homogeneus functions of ξr [see Appendix, Eqs. (68)
(37) and (38) are singular in ξr = 0. Consequently, the dressed

coordinates deﬁned through this prescription are not well deﬁned. To understand what

r (ξr) is not homegeneus in ξr. But the eﬀect of this nonhomogeneous term on the

factorization in ψ00..0(q′) or, equivalently, in φ00..0(Q) before promoting the proportionality
into an equality. That our choice, the factorization of 1 +
0 (0) in Eq. (27), is
the correct one is supported by the fact that we obtain well behaved dressed coordinates.

To further support our choice, we consider a system in which we can solve exactly for

11

the ground state, allowing us to obtain exact dressed coordinates. Comparing these exact

dressed coordinates and the perturbative ones we get the same answer. The model in

mention is the one whose Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (1) with coupling constants deﬁned

Note that at order λ both the quartic and sextic anharmonic Hamiltonians, given respec-

panding Eq. (45) at order λ we can see that it is indeed the case. Then we conclude that

our strategy for deﬁning perturbatively the dressed coordinates is the correct one.

4 The decay process of the ﬁrst excited state

In Ref. [7] the probability of the particle oscillator to remain in the ﬁrst excited state has

been computed at ﬁrst order for the nonlinear quartic interaction. However, as we have

already mentioned, the approach used there was more intuitive than formal.

In order

to see in what extent such calculation is correct, in this section we compute the same

quantity by using the formalism presented in the last section. To maintain the reasoning

as general as possible we present the steps necessary to compute the probability amplitude

associated with the most general transition,

m0m1...mN

m0, m1, ..., mN |

n0n1...nN (t) = dh

n0, n1, ..., nN id ,
that is, we prepare our system initially at time t = 0 in the dressed state

n0, n1, ..., nN id,
then we ask what is the probability amplitude of ﬁnding, in a measurement performed at
m0, m1, ..., mN id. Introducing a complete set of eigenstates of

time t, the dressed state

5 Conclusions

In this paper, after clarifying what we understand by dressed coordinates and dressed

states, we have developed a formal method to construct perturbatively dressed coordinates

in nonlinear systems. Although we restricted our calculations to a very special quartic

interacting term, we have pointed out the necessity of factoring a term in order to avoid

15

artiﬁcial singularities which otherwise would appear if we do not make such factorization.

That this factorization is the correct one has been checked by using an exactly solvable

sextic interacting model. Then, in more general nonlinear systems, one can follow the

same procedure to construct the dressed coordinates.

At the end of section II we remarked that for nonlinear systems, in the number rep-

resentation, the dressed ground state is not equivalent to the ground state of the total

system, see Eq. (18). This fact must not be seen as in contradiction with our deﬁni-

tion of dressed coordinates, since we have deﬁned them by requiring the equivalence of

the dressed ground state in dressed coordinates representation and the ground state of

the system in normal coordinates representation. We can understand the mentioned non

equivalence, by noting that although the dressed ground state is an eigenstate of the

dressed number operators (associated with the dressed coordinates) the ground state of

the system, in general, is not an eigenstate of the collective (normal) number operators.

For example, in the quartic nonlinear case one can easily verify that the ground state

(and also, the other eigenstates) is not an eigenstate of the collective number operators,

but a linear superposition of eigenstates of these operators [see Appendix, Eq. (62)].

Finally, we considered the computation of the probability of the particle oscillator to

remain excited in its ﬁrst excited level, and showed that the result coincides with the

result obtained in Ref.

[7]. Then, one of the conclusions of Ref.

[7] remains: the eﬀect

of the nonlinear quartic terms is the enhancement of the decay of the particle oscillator

from its ﬁrst excited level to the ground state. This fact, can be easily seen from Eq.
2 (the probability to the particle oscillator remain in the ﬁrst

(56) by noticing that

f00(t)

excited state in the absence of nonlinear interactions) in free space, is a decreasing (almost

|

|

exponentially) function of time.

Appendix: The perturbed eigenfunctions and eigen-

values

It is easy to see that the eigenfunctions of the quartic anharmonic oscillator can be written

formally as those given in Eq. (23). We have to notice only that any wave function can

be expanded in the basis φn(Q) (we omit here the index r), given by the eigenvalues of
ΩQ2/2) times

the linear part of the Hamiltonian. And since φn(Q) are given by exp(

a Hermite polynomial of degree n, we see that an expression of the type given in Eq.
n (√ΩQ) by using standard
(23) follows. In what follows we compute G(1)

n (√ΩQ) and G(2)

Double ionization of diatomic molecules by short linearly polarized laser pulses is analyzed. We
consider the ﬁnal stage of the ionization process, that is the decay of a highly excited two electron
molecule, which is formed after re-scattering. The saddles of the eﬀective adiabatic potential energy
close to which simultaneous escape of electrons takes place are identiﬁed. Numerical simulations
of the ionization of molecules show that the process can be dominated by either sequential or non-
sequential events. In order to increase the ratio of non-sequential to sequential ionizations very short
laser pulses should be applied.

INTRODUCTION

High intensity ultrashort-pulse lasers allow experi-
mental studies of multi-electron eﬀects, such as a non-
sequential double ionization, high order harmonic genera-
tion or above threshold ionization [1, 2]. While the single
ionization of atoms or molecules, as well as the high order
harmonic generation can be described within a single ac-
tive electron model, such an approximation in the case of
double ionization and laser intensity below the saturation
value gives ionization rates that are much smaller than
experimentally observed, indicating that interactions be-
tween electrons are important [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this paper we
consider the double ionization of molecules within a clas-
sical model for electrons in a combined Coulomb and ex-
ternal ﬁeld applying the approach developed in [5, 6, 7, 8]
for the multiple ionization of atoms.

Multi-photon double ionization of atoms in strong laser
ﬁelds can be regarded as a three step process [1, 2]. In
the ﬁrst step one electron tunnels out through the Stark
saddle and then is returned back to the nucleus [9, 10].
Thereafter, in the second step a highly excited state of
an atom or a molecule is formed at the expense of the
energy brought back by the returning electron (up to
3.17Up, where Up is a ponderomotive energy). Finally, in
the third step such a highly excited compound state de-
cays in several ways through a single, double or multiple
ionization. The starting point in our classical analysis of
the double ionization of molecules is the excited complex,
i.e. we assume that we have an initial state of two highly
excited electrons close to the molecular core. We shall fo-
cus on double ionization events that can then appear as a
possible channels of decay. Among those events there are:
a sequential process (when the highly excited compound
state decays emitting electrons one by one) and a non-
sequential event (two electron leave the excited molecule
simultaneously).

There have been experimental research aimed on dou-
ble ionization of diatomic molecules [11, 12, 13, 14]
which showed that there are diﬀerences between molecu-
lar species. For example, nitrogen molecule, N2, clearly

exhibits a ”knee-structure” in a double-to-single ioniza-
tion yields ratio, like atoms do, while for oxygen molecule,
O2, such a structure is rather not visible [12, 13]. More-
over, in the case of N2 it seems, that electrons escape
with similar momenta along ﬁeld polarization axis more
often than in the case of O2 [14]. We consider this prob-
lem from the point of view of the classical analysis, which
starts after the formation of the highly excited compound
state, and discuss possible reasons for such diﬀerent ex-
perimental observations.

Paper is structured as follows in Sec. II we intro-
duce a theoretical model on which we based our anal-
ysis. Sec. III consists of the identiﬁcation and descrip-
tion of the saddles in the potential. Then in Sec. IV we
present results of the numerical simulations. And ﬁnally,
in Sec. V we conclude.

II. MODEL

As we mentioned above, in our starting situation (as
a result of the former re-scattering) there are two highly
excited electrons close to the molecular core in the pres-
ence of linearly polarized laser ﬁeld. The motion of the
molecular core is frozen due to the fact that for short
laser pulses molecules have not enough time to change
their orientation [14, 15]. Thus, the Hamiltonian reads
(in atomic units):

H =

+ V,

1 + p2
p2
2
2

where the potential,

V = V1 + V2 + V12 + VF ,

consists of the potential energies associated with interac-
tions of the electrons with the nuclei (the entire structure
of the molecular core is approximated by two positively
charge nuclei),

Vi = −

for (i = 1, 2), where Ri and ri indicate position of the nu-
clei and the electrons, respectively, the repulsion between
electrons,

and the term describing interaction with the ﬁeld (polar-
ized along the z axis),

V12 =

1
|r1 − r2|

,

VF = F (t)(z1 + z2).

The electric ﬁeld strength F (t) has an oscillatory com-
ponent times the envelope from the pulse, namely:

F (t) = F f (t) cos(ωt + φ),

with F , ω and φ the peak amplitude, frequency, and
initial phase of the ﬁled, respectively, and with

2
f (t) = sin

(πt/Td),

the pulse envelope of duration

Td = n

2π
ω

,

where n is number of cycles in the pulse.

For a sake of convenience, we shall place the origin of
our coordinate system in the center of mass of the nu-
clei, then two parameters appear, namely: d, distance
between nuclei, and θ, angle between molecular axis and
z axis (polarization axis). Without loss of generality we
assumed that the molecule lies in xz plane, hence poten-
tial energies for each electron is:

Vi = −

i + (zi + d

−

q(xi − d

.

(9)

As one can see, in our model the only diﬀerence be-
tween diﬀerent diatomic species lies in the distance, d,
between the nuclei.

III. LOCAL ANALYSIS

What we consider in this paper is the evolution of elec-
trons in combined Coulomb and external ﬁelds after a re-
scattering event when the highly excited compound state
is formed. For one electron in the Coulomb potential, if
the external ﬁeld is non-zero the Stark saddle is opened.
Then the electron can get away through this saddle and
ionize.
In our case we have two electrons and if there
were no interaction between the electrons they could es-
cape simultaneously through the same saddle on top of
each other. But once there is repulsion between electrons,
the Stark saddle splits into two saddles that lie on the op-
posite sides of the ﬁeld polarization axis. In the case of

2

atoms, those two saddles lie symmetrically with respect
to the polarization axis. Then the motion of the elec-
trons can be conﬁned in some symmetry subspace [5, 6].
For diatomic molecules (such as N2 or O2) that does not
generally occur since they possess their own symmetry
axis which can be oriented at any angle to the polariza-
tion axis destroying the global symmetry. Nevertheless,
saddles are formed by the external ﬁeld and following ar-
guments presented in [5, 6, 7, 8] we assume that electrons
to leave the molecule in a correlated manner have to pass
simultaneously close to them.

Before the double ionization escape both electrons pass
close to the nuclei where they interact strongly with each
other and with the nuclei. For that reason we assume
that all memory of the previous motion is lost. Then it is
correct to assume that the compound state which decays
to a doubly charged molecule may be classically simu-
lated by a statistical distribution for two electrons close
to the nuclei. Furthermore, the classical motion of the
electrons is fast compared to the ﬁeld oscillations and an
adiabatic approximation, keeping the ﬁeld ﬁxed, becomes
useful in the analysis of the ionization channels. Using
this adiabatic assumption we will identify and describe
saddle points, through which the electrons can escape.

For a molecule oriented along the ﬁeld axis the problem
possesses axial symmetry. Then switching to the cylin-
drical coordinates (ρi, ϕi, zi for i−th electron) one can
easily deﬁne a symmetry subspace of electron motion.
Restricting the electrons to a plane (i.e. ϕ1 − ϕ2 = π)
their coordinates in the C2v symmetry subspace are
ρ1 = ρ2 = R, z1 = z2 = Z and the potential energy
reduces to

V = −

2 )2

(10)

−

2
qR2 + (Z + d

2 )2

+ 2F (t)Z.

With a molecule oriented perpendicularly with respect
to the ﬁeld there are two C2v symmetry subspaces. One
subspace is deﬁned in the xz plane the other in the yz
plane.
In the former case, the electron coordinates in
the subspace are (x1 = X, y1 = 0, z1 = Z) and (x2 =
−X, y2 = 0, z2 = Z) and the potential energy reads

And for saddles which are in the yz plane, namely coor-
dinates are (x1 = 0, y1 = Y, z1 = Z) and (x2 = 0, y2 =
−Y, z2 = Z) and the potential energy is

The potential energies Eqs. (10), (11) and (12) are shown
in Fig. 1 for a set of parameters corresponding to the
nitrogen molecule (internuclear distance is d = 2.067
a.u.) and for the ﬁeld F (t) = 0.07 a.u.
(an intensity
of 1.7 × 1014 W/cm2). The saddles are clearly visible.

In a non-sequential double ionization the electrons
have to pass suﬃciently close to the saddles (exempli-
ﬁed in Fig. 1 for molecular orientation being θ = 0 and
θ = π/2). For a general orientation of a molecule there
are two possible channels for non-sequential ionization
— the electrons escape by passing saddles situated in a
plane deﬁned by the ﬁeld and molecular axes or in the
perpendicular plane. These two channels are equivalent
when a molecule is parallel to the ﬁeld and the axial sym-
metry is restored.

For a ﬁxed external ﬁeld local analysis of the saddles
reveals a few stable and unstable directions. The latter
are responsible for either simultaneous double electron
escape or single ionization (in such a process one elec-
tron leaves the molecule while the other returns to the
core). Each of unstable directions can be characterized
by a Lyapunov exponent. Knowledge of the Lyapunov
exponents allows one, similarly like in the problem of
double ionization without the external ﬁeld considered
many years ago by Wannier [16, 17, 18, 19], to derive the
dependence of the cross section on energy close to the
threshold, namely,

Y

where λr is the Lyapunov exponent of the unstable di-
rection corresponding to the non-sequential double ion-
ization and λi are all other Lyapunov exponents of a
saddle [7, 20].

We examine properties of the saddles as the internu-
clear distance, d, increases — the results are shown in
Fig. 2. Starting with d = 0 (in that case θ is meaning-
less since a molecule reduces to an atom) and increasing d
the energy VS of the saddle corresponding to the molecule
orientation θ = 0 is always the lowest and it decreases.
For the other extremal orientation, i.e. θ = π/2, the en-
ergies of the saddles (there are two saddles because of
the axial symmetry breaking) increase and their values
are the highest. Analyzing the dependence of α on the
internuclear distance we see that increasing d the cross
section exponent of one of the saddles (corresponding to
θ = π/2) goes up while the other goes down. The expo-
nent for θ = 0 slightly increases.

Now let us examine how the parameters of the saddles
change with the orientation θ in the case of N2 (d = 2.067
a.u.) and O2 (d = 2.28 a.u.) molecules, see Fig. 3. The
energy VS of all saddles increases and the exponent α of
one member of the saddle pairs increases while the other
decreases. Fig. 3 shows that the parameters for N2 and

the ﬁeld polarization axis, Z, (θ = π/2, middle and bottom
panels corresponding to Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), respectively).
F (t) = 0.07 a.u., d = 2.067 a.u.

O2 molecules are quite similar — the largest diﬀerences
between the species are of the order of few percent. Tak-
ing into account that the experimental results [14, 15]
are the statistical mixtures of diﬀerent molecule orienta-
tions we may conclude that from the point of view of our
local analysis of the non-sequential decay channels there
should be no diﬀerences between N2 and O2.

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

So far we have discussed the local analysis of the poten-
tial within the adiabatic assumption. Now we are ready
to go one step further and perform numerical simulations.
In the Coulomb potentials associated with interaction be-
tween the electrons and nuclei, Eq. (9), we introduce a
smoothing factor e [21, 22] to avoid divergence in numeri-
cal integration of equation of motions. Then the potential
terms read

Vi = −

1
2 sin θ)2 + y2
i + (zi + d

2 sin θ)2 + y2
i + (zi − d

q(xi + d

−

q(xi − d

2 cos θ)2 + e

. (15)

2 cos θ)2 + e

We choose e = 0.01 which introduces negligible changes
of the VS and α parameters presented in Figs. 2 and 3.
Assuming an initial re-scattering event took place, two
excited electrons pass close to the nuclei where they inter-
act strongly with each other and with the nuclei. There-
fore, it is reasonable to assume, as mentioned in Sec. III

that all the memory of the earlier motion is lost. Then
the initial state of the ﬁnal stage for double ionization is
a statistical distribution for two electrons close to the nu-
clei. Hence, we choose initial values of positions and mo-
menta with respect to the microcanonical distribution for
a given initial energy E (it should be in the range between
−I and −I + 3.17Up, where I is the ionization energy).
The positions are chosen microcanonically but with ad-
ditional conditions, namely zi = 0 and
i < 85
a.u. [5]. We start all simulations at the peak of the laser
pulse with the phase of the ﬁeld chosen randomly. In all
simulations an ensamble of 105 trajectories is used.

Distributions of the ﬁnal electron momenta parallel to
the ﬁeld axis for diﬀerent initial energy E and for diﬀerent
pulse durations are presented in Fig. 4 . All data in the
ﬁgure correspond to the N2 molecule oriented along the
ﬁeld axis. For very short laser pulses (n = 2 cycles) sig-
natures of simultaneous electron escape are clearly visible
— the distributions are localized along the diagonals in-
dicating that the electrons escape predominately by pass-
ing close to the saddles analyzed in Sec. III. For longer
pulses the distributions change their character. The ﬁrst

and fourth quadrants of the panels become strongly pop-
ulated implying that a number of sequential decays sig-
niﬁcantly increases. The reason for that is quite obvi-
ous. After re-scattering when a highly excited two elec-
tron complex is created, there are two dominant scenarios
within the ﬁrst half cycle of the ﬁeld: a non-sequential
double escape or a single ionization. During the next
cycles, unless the molecule is already doubly ionized, we
are left with a singly ionized molecule which may survive
to the end of the pulse or the second electron escapes
and that corresponds to a sequential double ionization.
The longer pulse duration the more sequential ionizations
which may easily overcome the number of non-sequential
events. Thus for suﬃciently long pulses, even though
the re-scattering scenario is involved in the double ion-
ization process, the momentum distributions will show
signatures of the sequential electron escape. If the ini-
tial energy E is much higher than the minimal energy
of a saddle (VS ≈ −1.2 a.u.) then probability of non-
sequential ionization is bigger and even if the pulse dura-
tion is quite long (e.g. n = 26 in panel (b) of Fig. 4) the
signatures of non-sequential process remain (contrary to
panel (d) where for E = −0.6 a.u. such signatures are
not visible). In Fig. 5 one can ﬁnd the distributions of ion
parallel momenta that correspond to the data presented
in Fig. 4. The distributions, as expected, are much nar-
rower in the case when sequential ionization dominates

than in the case when non-sequential process does.

When we change the orientation of the molecule the
distributions do not change signiﬁcantly as one can see
comparing Fig. 6 and Fig. 4. For the ﬁeld amplitude
used in the simulations (which corresponds also to the
experiment [14]) the saddles for non-sequential process
are lying quite away from the nuclei and the positions
and other parameters of the saddles change slightly only
with a change of θ — compare Fig. 3.

Finally in Fig. 7 we show data for the O2 molecule. As
expected, from the local analysis presented in Sec. III, for
the same initial energies E and pulse durations as in the
case of the N2 molecule observed momentum distribu-
tions are very similar, compare Fig. 4. In Eremina et al.,
experiment [14] the results for O2 diﬀer from the data for
N2. The latter shows signatures of simultaneous electron
escape while for N2 it seems that sequential process dom-
inates. Our analysis indicates that there is practically no
diﬀerence between N2 and O2 if similar initial conditions
for highly excited complex are chosen. It strongly sug-
gests that the diﬀerences between the observations in the
two experiments are due to diﬀerences in the early stages
of the excitation process and the nature of the compound

Our analysis also indicates that to increase the ratio of

should be used. It opens a possibility for observation of
clear signatures of simultaneous electron escape for O2

V. SUMMARY

To summarize, we have performed a purely classical
analysis of the ﬁnal stage of the non-sequential double
It is
ionization of molecules in the strong laser ﬁeld.
based on the fact that all trajectories leading to the non-
sequential escape of electrons have to pass close to the
saddles in the potential that is formed when the laser
pulse arrives [5, 6, 7, 8].

We have started with the local analysis of the potential
within the adiabatic approximation, and we have iden-
tiﬁed and described the saddles. Thereafter, we have
shown results of numerical simulations. The later allow
us to draw two conclusions: i) From the point of view of
classical analysis there is no diﬀerence between nitrogen

E = −0.3 a.u. and θ = 0. (a) n = 2 and (b) n = 26.

entation of the molecule with respect to the ﬁeld axis
does not inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the ﬁnal momentum dis-
tribution for the initial energy range considered in the
paper.

The numerical results and their interpretation suggests
strongly that shorter laser pulses should lead to an in-
crease of the ratio of non-sequential to sequential ioniza-
tions. That suggestion could be tested experimentally.
Higher relative eﬃciency of non-sequential process would
be visible in the momentum distributions as a more pro-
nounced symmetrical escape of the electrons.

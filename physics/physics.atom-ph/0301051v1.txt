We develop an analytical theory of dark resonances that accounts for the full atomic-level struc-
ture, as well as all ﬁeld-induced eﬀects such as coherence preparation, optical pumping, ac Stark
shifts, and power broadening. The analysis uses a model based on relaxation constants that as-
sumes the total collisional depolarization of the excited state. A good qualitative agreement with
experiments for Cs in Ne is obtained.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear interference eﬀects connected with the atomic ground state coherence are now well known and widely used
[1]. One of the most promising classes of these eﬀects, especially for precise measurements, is that of super-narrow dark
resonances [2, 3, 4] that appear in the medium’s response to bichromatic laser excitation, when the laser frequency
diﬀerence is close to the atomic ground-state splitting. The use of vapor cells containing a buﬀer gas in addition to an
alkali vapor has allowed the measurement of resonance linewidths less than 50 Hz [5, 6]. While such resonances have
been extensively investigated experimentally (especially in the case of Cs) [2], a detailed theoretical understanding
is not yet well developed for realistic multilevel systems, motivating the present work. Our theory was developed in
close connection with ongoing eﬀorts to construct compact atomic clocks [3, 7, 8, 9] and magnetometers [2, 4]. For
any practical application of dark resonances, the stability and accuracy are optimized with respect to parameters such
as the output signal amplitude, width, and shift. In the problem considered here, many parameters, such as laser
detunings, ﬁeld component polarizations and amplitudes, and buﬀer gas pressure, aﬀect the dark resonance itself. In
addition, various excitation schemes (for example, D2 versus D1 line excitation [10]) and diﬀerent atomic isotopes
can be used. A natural question arises: what design will optimize the performance of the clock (or magnetometer)?
Previous theories did not completely answer this question. One main obstacle was connected with the complicated
energy-level structure of the real atomic systems used in experiments.

Generally speaking, there are several types of problems in the theoretical description of dark resonances. One
problem relates to a proper treatment of the relaxation processes in the system, including velocity-changing collisions
[11] and the spatial diﬀusion of coherently prepared atoms [12, 13]. Light propagation through coherently prepared
nonlinear media, especially through optically thick media [14], can be thought of as another type of diﬃculty. This
paper addresses another important problem: that of ﬁeld-induced processes in multilevel systems such as coherence
preparation, optical pumping, ac Stark shifts, and power broadening. All existing theories can be classiﬁed into three
kinds: few-state models (basically, three-state lambda systems) [6, 15, 16], perturbation theories [17], and numerical
simulations [6, 15]. All three classes of theories have disadvantages. The ﬁrst theory neglects many details of the
actual conﬁguration of atomic levels. Perturbation theory neglects some eﬀects induced by the presence of the optical
ﬁeld (namely, optical pumping, ac Stark shifts, and power broadening). Numerical simulation theories demonstrate a
lack of genuine understanding and predictive power.

This paper presents a new analytical theory, that accounts for the level structure (both Zeeman and hyperﬁne)
of a real atom, as well as all ﬁeld-induced eﬀects. The relaxation processes are treated in the simplest way: by
neglecting velocity-changing collisions and all eﬀects connected with the spatial inhomogeneity, we reduce the model
to one described simply by relaxation constants. The crucial assumption is total collisional depolarization of the
excited state. In addition, we add the (optional) approximations of homogeneous broadening and low saturation.
With these approximations, a general analytical result is obtained for the atomic response, which result is valid
for arbitrary excitation schemes (D2 as well as D1 lines), light ﬁeld polarizations, and magnetic ﬁelds.
In the
speciﬁc case of circularly polarized light in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, where only two states participate in
the coherence preparation, analytical lineshapes (generalized Lorentzian) coincide exactly with the phenomenological
model heuristically introduced previously to ﬁt experimental data [18].
In the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld, and
when contributions of diﬀerent Zeeman sub-states are well overlapped, the resonance lineshape is also approximately

described by the generalized Lorentzian. A comparison of analytically calculated coeﬃcients of the Lorentz-Lorenz
model (with no free parameters) with coeﬃcients extracted from experimental data demonstrates a good qualitative
agreement.

II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

In this section, the general framework of the problem is described, the basic assumptions we make are stated and
the speciﬁc procedure for calculating the quantities of interest is outlined. We consider the resonant interaction of
alkali atoms in the S1/2 ground state with a two-frequency laser ﬁeld

E(z, t) = E1 exp[

i(ω1t

k1z)] + E2 exp[

where both components propagate in the positive direction (k1,2 > 0). The ﬁeld can excite atoms either to the P1/2
state (D1 line) or to the P3/2 state (D2 line). Two hyperﬁne (HF) components are present in the ground state with
1/2 (where I is the nuclear spin). The HF splitting in the
the total angular momenta F1 = I + 1/2 and F2 = I
E1 − E2)/¯h is in the range 1 to 10 GHz. The excited state has two (D1 line) or four (D2 line) HF
ground state ∆ = (
levels with the angular momenta Fe = I
Ee = ¯hωe. The HF splitting of the excited
Je, . . . , I + Je and the energies
state is typically one order of magnitude smaller than ∆. To be more speciﬁc, we assume that the frequency ω1 is close
Fe
to resonance with the F1 →
transitions. Thus, we have a Λ-type excitation scheme (Fig. 1). In the absence of an external B-ﬁeld, the HF levels
are degenerate with respect to the total angular momentum projections. For the Zeeman sub-states the following
shorthand notations will be used:

For simplicity, we consider ﬁrst an atom at rest, positioned at the origin z = 0. Each frequency component of the

to the optical shifts and optical pumping rates, as well as in temporal oscillations of the atomic density matrix. The

Since this paper is concerned with the ﬁeld-induced eﬀects in multi-level atomic systems, the relaxation processes
are modeled by several constants. The homogeneous broadening of the optical line, due mainly to collisions with a
buﬀer gas, is described by the constant γ. We assume that the excited state is completely depolarized due to collisions
during the radiative lifetime τe, i.e., the depolarization rates γκ obey the condition

γκ τe ≫
The relaxation of the ground-state density matrix to the isotropic equilibrium, both due to the diﬀusion through the
laser beam and due to collisions, is modeled by a single constant Γ.

Here we consider the steady-state regime, setting (d/dt)

σgg = 0 in (6). As a spectroscopic signal, we consider the
total excited-state population πe, which is proportional to the total light absorption in optically thin media or to
the total ﬂuorescence. The following procedure is used to ﬁnd πe. From (6), the ground-state density matrix
σgg
is expressed in terms of πe, and then πe is calculated from the normalization condition (7). The solution of this
algebraic problem can be obtained in a compact analytical form in two important special cases. The ﬁrst arises when
both ﬁeld components have the same simple (circular or linear) polarization and there is no magnetic ﬁeld. Here, for
a suitable choice of the quantization axis, the excitation matrix
R contains only diagonal elements with respect to
the magnetic quantum number, i.e., m = m′ in (9). The second case appears when a magnetic ﬁeld is applied and
just a few substates contribute to the Raman coherence for arbitrary light polarizations and arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld
directions. Both cases are considered below.

We turn now to the case of circular ﬁeld polarization when the quantization axis is directed orthogonal to the
polarization vector (or alternatively linear polarization when the quantization axis is aligned along the polarization
vector). We evaluate the total excited-state population, πe, in order to determine how the dark resonance signal
(proportional to πe) depends on parameters such as the optical detuning from resonance. Under these assumptions,
the complete set of equations (6) can be split into independent blocks for each magnetic quantum number m (m-

(m1, m2)-block [23].

V. THE RESONANCE LINESHAPE

We now consider the dark resonance lineshape in more detail. First, we analyze the particular case in which just
two sub-states
participate in the Raman coherence, i.e., we consider the magnetically insensitive
resonance (m = 0) in a magnetic ﬁeld. This (0, 0) resonance is of primary interest for possible clock applications
[2, 3, 7], because it is only sensitive to a magnetic ﬁeld in second order. Here the absorption signal, n′′

The result (18) for the resonance lineshape is quite general. In fact, it does not depend on our simpliﬁed assumptions
on the relaxation processes but is valid also in the low-saturation limit for arbitrary relaxation matrix, whenever only
two states participate in the coherence preparation and δR ≪
Turning to the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld and simple ﬁeld polarization, we proceed with the goal of determining
the resonance position, width and amplitudes of the symmetrical and asymmetrical components as above. Since all

VI. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENT

(26)

e

The analytical lineshape (18) coincides exactly with the phenomenological model heuristically introduced previously
to ﬁt experimental data [18]. In those experiments a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) was modulated at
the 9.2-GHz hyperﬁne splitting frequency of the cesium atom, so that the laser output spectrum contained modulation
sidebands at this frequency. Using the carrier and one of the sidebands the dark resonance could be prepared and
spectroscopically observed, as a function of the detuning δL of the laser frequency from optical resonance. Data was
taken for three diﬀerent power ratios of carrier and sideband, with the cesium atoms contained in a cell with 8.7 kPa
of neon as a buﬀer gas. Detection used a modulation technique that allowed to extract simultaneously the absorption
and the dispersion line shape [24]. For each detuning δL, both line shapes were simultaneously ﬁtted by the model
γ, and δ0 as free parameters. Actually, as far as the line shapes themselves are concerned,

γ describe the shape, and the rest the overall amplitude and position of the

Since these experimental data for Cs in Ne are ﬁtted by (18) quite well, we can compare analytically calculated
coeﬃcients of the generalized Lorentzian to those extracted from experimental data. The dependence of the coeﬃcients

exceeds the dephasing rate Γ in zero ﬁeld: all the parameters C1, C2, δ0, and

test is provided by the dependence of the coeﬃcients on the one-photon detuning δL, and on the intensity ratio

= 0.4 mW/cm2, optical linewidth γ = 2π 750 MHz, and ground-state
relaxation rate Γ = 2π 150 Hz. We use no free parameters, just a single trivial scaling factor for C1 and C2, and a
constant oﬀset for δ0 that accounts for the collisional shift of the dark resonance position.

We see a good qualitative agreement, especially for the resonance position δ0 and for the width

γ. There are some
noticeable discrepancies for the amplitudes C1 and C2. In particular, we can see that the theoretical curve for C1
can cross the zero level at large δL, which can be attributed to the well-known Raman absorption, but which is not
observed in the experimental data.

VII. D2 LINE EXCITATION AND CONNECTION TO PREVIOUSLY EXISTING THEORIES

In the speciﬁc case of the D2 line of Cs at high buﬀer-gas pressure, the two-photon amplitudes U and V are much
smaller than the optical pumping rates R(0)
, respectively, because the most probable optical
Fe = I +Je and F2 →
transitions F1 →
Je contribute to the one-photon transitions but not to the two-photon
Raman coupling. Note that the ratio between V and R(0)
can be arbitrary, depending on the one-photon detuning
δL. As a result, the part of the absorption signal that varies with δR is small compared to the constant one, and we
arrive, to lowest orders, at the following approximate expressions. The parameter

The amplitudes C1 and C2 are given by (21) and (22) with x = 0 and

γ from (27).

These results can be compared with those for a three-level Λ system in the low-saturation limit. Our formulas

(18)-(22) will describe this last case, as well, if we set Z = 0, i.e.,

VIII. DARK RESONANCE POSITION. THREE POSSIBLE DEFINITIONS

The center position of the dark resonance in essence determines the output frequency of the frequency reference or
the magnetic ﬁeld indicated by the magnetometer. Especially for asymmetrical resonances, it is somewhat unclear
exactly how that center position is deﬁned. The quantity δ0 above is one possible deﬁnition of the resonance position,
corresponding to the combined minimum of the absorptive part, and zero of the dispersive part, of the resonance
described by (17).

Using (18)-(22), one can easily ﬁnd another possible deﬁnition of the resonance center: the Raman detuning

corresponding to minimum absorption.

A third possible deﬁnition is the point y0, where the dispersion n′
DR associated with the absorption (18) (by the
e
e
Kramers-Kronig relations) is equal to zero. This is found to be

Each of these three quantities, δmin, y0 and δ0, could be considered the resonance center, depending on how the
resonance is measured experimentally. In the general asymmetrical case, when V
= 0 (non-zero eﬀective one-photon
detuning) and
Γ2 (unbalanced optical pumping rates), all three values are diﬀerent. Even their behavior versus
δL are qualitatively diﬀerent (Fig. 7): near the one-photon resonance (V = 0) the centroid δ0 of the Lorentzians
has a dispersion-like shape, while δmin is rather of an absorptive nature, and y0 has a more complicated shape of
mixed type. In addition, δ0 and δmin are always ﬁnite, whereas y0 goes to inﬁnity at the zeros of C1. These diﬀerent
dependences on optical detuning could, for example, alter the sensitivity of the frequency reference or magnetometer
to the optical lock point. As a result, careful consideration must be given to the resonance detection method when
designing frequency references or magnetometers based on dark resonances.

IX. CONCLUSION

Using very simple assumptions about the relaxation processes, analytical results can be obtained for the nonlinear
absorption of bichromatic radiation near a two-photon resonance. The theory fully takes into account both the HF
and the Zeeman level structures of alkali atoms as well as all light-induced eﬀects. Our results constitute a good basis
for understanding experimental works and further possible reﬁnements of theory are possible. In particular, the case

In addition, the theory allows for a simple parameterization of experimentally measured dark resonances in terms
of absorptive and dispersive components. The theory can therefore predict, for example, the detuning for which the
dispersive part of the resonance is minimized and, for a given detuning, the asymmetry in the resonance lineshape
that might be expected. The analysis of the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the resonance center position is also of interest for
practical applications based on dark resonances such as atomic frequency standards and magnetometers. It appears
likely that the additional understanding gained by the thorough theoretical analysis presented here will lead to further
reﬁnement and development of current and future applications based on dark resonances.

The structure of the collisional term
can be found in [20]. Here we simply recall that during the course of a
collision only the electronic component of the atomic polarization is depolarized. The nuclear component is involved
in the process of depolarization due to the HF coupling. For all alkali atoms, the excited-state HF splitting ∆e is
much greater than radiative decay rate 1/τe. In addition we assume that the collisional relaxation rates γκ for the
excited-state electronic multipole moments of rank κ = 1, . . . , 2Je + 1 also obey the conditions γκτe ≫
1 (for κ = 0 we
assume γ0 = 0, i.e. the collision-induced transitions between the ﬁne structure components are not considered here).

Here we shall illustrate this fact in one speciﬁc case, when the excited-state HF splitting is much larger than the
depolarization rates γκ and when all the depolarization rates (except for γ0) are the same (so-called pure electronic
γκ, 1/τe, one can neglect HF coherence in the excited state. For pure electronic
randomization model [20]). If ∆e ≫

Thus, we see that in the case of total collisional depolarization of the excited state, when the excited-state density
matrix is proportional to
Pe [as shown in (A5)], (A3) is reduced to (6). In addition, the expression for the optical
coherence matrix (A2) allows one to calculate various spectroscopic signals (as well as the total absorption), for
example, the total dispersion.

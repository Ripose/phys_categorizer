We present a cooling method that should be generally ap-
plicable to atoms with narrow optical transitions. This tech-
nique uses velocity-selective pulses to drive atoms towards a
zero-velocity dark state and then quenches the excited state
to increase the cooling rate. We demonstrate this technique
of quenched narrow-line cooling by reducing the 1-D temper-
ature of a sample of neutral 40Ca atoms. We velocity select
and cool with the 1S0(4s2)→3P1(4s4p) 657 nm intercombi-
nation line and quench with the 3P1(4s4p)→1S0(4s5s) inter-
combination line at 553 nm, which increases the cooling rate
eight-fold. Limited only by available quenching laser power,
we have transferred 18 % of the atoms from our initial 2 mK
velocity distribution and achieved temperatures as low as 4
µK, corresponding to a vrms of 2.8 cm/s or 2 recoils at 657
nm. This cooling technique, which is closely related to Raman
cooling, can be extended to three dimensions.

Following the great success of sub-Doppler laser cool-
ing techniques with alkali atoms, several groups are now
striving to achieve similar cooling results for the alkaline-
earth atoms, with applications ranging from Bose-
Einstein condensation to atomic interferometry and opti-
cal frequency standards. Unfortunately, the lack of mag-
netic and hyperﬁne sub-structure in the ground states
of the predominant alkaline-earth isotopes precludes
the usual sub-Doppler mechanisms such as polarization-
gradient cooling [1,2], velocity-selective coherent pop-
ulation trapping [3], or Raman cooling [4]. Further-
more, the broad cooling transitions for the alkaline-earth
atoms have large Doppler limits, and typically yield
magneto-optic trap (MOT) temperatures of more than
1 mK [5–7]. These complications have necessitated the
development of alternative cooling strategies to reach the
microkelvin temperatures “routinely” achieved with sev-
eral alkali species. This paper presents a new approach,
termed “quenched narrow-line laser cooling” (QNLC),
which uses a narrow optical transition to provide in-
creased velocity selectivity for laser cooling, and quench-
ing of the upper state of this transition to enhance the
cooling eﬃciency. To demonstrate the potential of this
technique, we have used repeated velocity-selective step-
wise excitation with two intercombination lines of neutral
40Ca to transfer as much as 18 % of the atoms in an initial
velocity distribution with a 2 mK temperature into a nar-
row peak. The lowest 1-D temperature observed was 4
µK with a corresponding transfer eﬃciency of 7 %. More-
over, these results can be signiﬁcantly improved simply
by increasing the quenching power, and can be readily

extended to two or three dimensions. These greatly re-
duced temperatures should signiﬁcantly reduce the un-
certainty in Ca-based optical frequency standards, for
which a recent measurement of the absolute frequency
was principally limited by residual atomic velocity [8].

Our approach to second-stage cooling takes advantage
of the two-electron structure of these atoms, which gives
rise to narrow intercombination lines. In principle, these
transitions can serve as excellent frequency or velocity
(via the ﬁrst-order Doppler shift) discriminators, which
are ideal for sub-recoil laser cooling. The spectacular
results achieved with the intercombination line of 88Sr,
for which temperatures of 700 nK have been attained,
conﬁrm the potential of these transitions [9,10]. Unfor-
tunately, for several species, such as Ca and Mg, the
intercombination line is too weak to eﬀectively cool a
distribution with an initial temperature of several mil-
likelvins. Nonetheless, Binnewies et al. [11] were able to
use the velocity selectivity of the Ca intercombination
line at 657 nm to demonstrate a new cooling mechanism,
Maxwell-demon cooling. They were able to achieve a net
transfer of 5 % of the initial distribution into a peak with
a 1-D temperature of < 10 µK. However, this technique
does not seem to lend itself to 3-D cooling, which is crit-
ical for many applications.

A more versatile approach is to increase the cooling ef-
ﬁciency by quenching the upper level of the narrow tran-
sition through excitation to another state that decays
In Fig. 1 we show
more quickly to the ground state.
how we quench the metastable 3P1 state in Ca (lifetime
= 400 µs) through excitation to the 1S0 (4s5s) level (life-
time = 30 ns) via the intercombination line at 553 nm.
The enhancement of narrow-line cooling rates through
quenching was ﬁrst demonstrated in the context of side-
band cooling of trapped ions [12,13]. When applied to
neutral atoms, quenching can increase the cooling eﬃ-
ciency not only by speeding up the rate at which one
repeats cooling cycles, but also by giving the atoms addi-
tional momentum kicks towards zero velocity. These ad-
vantages were used to increase the force on a metastable
He atomic beam by excitation of a two-photon transition
with simultaneous light ﬁelds [14].

To take advantage of the velocity selectivity of the
narrow transition, however, it is essential to excite the
atoms in a stepwise manner with time-separated pulses.
One can then implement the velocity-selective excita-
tion strategies that have been used with great success
in Raman cooling. In the ﬁrst demonstration of Raman
cooling, Kasevich and Chu used a Raman transition be-

1

tween hyperﬁne ground states to cool Na atoms to a
1-D temperature of 100 nK and a 3-D temperature of
4.3 µK [4,15]. Later Reichel et al. used square Raman-
cooling pulses to achieve a 1-D temperature of 3 nK for
Cs [16].

For quenching times short compared to excitation
times used for the narrow transition, we propose the fol-
lowing QNLC procedure and illustrate it with the Ca sys-
tem. We start by pumping a velocity slice towards zero
velocity using light whose frequency is tuned slightly red
of the 1S0→3P1 intercombination line at 657 nm (see Fig.
1). Due to the narrow linewidth of this transition (400
Hz), the spectra of our red pulses are Fourier-transform
limited, so we can easily control the width and shape of
the velocity group excited. We then quench the 3P1 pop-
ulation with a 553 nm light pulse (copropagating with
the red pump beam), which moves the population to the
1S0(4s5s) state and gives the velocity-selected atoms a
second momentum kick towards zero velocity. From this
state the atoms quickly return to the ground state via two
cascaded decays (see Fig. 1) with their associated (ran-
domly directed) recoils. Next we use a similar sequence
of red and green pulses from the opposite direction to
pump a second velocity slice, symmetrically located on
the opposite side of the distribution, towards zero. A
single cooling cycle can thus reduce atomic velocities on
both sides of the distribution by two-photon momenta
(analogous to the case of Raman cooling). We repeat this
cooling cycle many times, driving the atoms towards zero
velocity, which coincides with a zero in our sinc2 Fourier-
transform-limited excitation function. In this way, atoms
that accumulate around zero velocity have only a small
probability of being pumped away, so in principle, ex-
tremely low temperatures can be achieved. As in the case
of Raman cooling, the cooling limit is set by the cooling
time and the width of the small transition-probability
region around zero velocity, but not by the random re-
coils. Narrower sinc2 functions (i.e.
longer red pulses
in the time domain) yield colder temperatures, but they
address a smaller range of velocities, so there is a com-
promise between temperature and number, unless cooling
with a sequence of pulse widths is used [4,15,16].

In our experimental demonstration of this technique,
inadequate light power at 553 nm (limited by what could
be transferred through a 180 m ﬁber) led to quenching
times that were an order of magnitude longer than the
velocity-selective cooling pulses. Under these conditions
it was more eﬃcient to use a slightly modiﬁed version of
the procedure just described, in which we use a standing-
wave pulse of 553 nm light to quench the 3P1 state after
each pair of counter-propagating red pulse excitations.
The drawback to this approach is the randomness intro-
duced in the direction of the momentum kick from the
quenching pulse. This loss, however, is more than oﬀ-
set in our case by the increased intensity of a standing
(rather than travelling) wave that reduces the quenching

time and the number of quenching pulses (by two) used
per cooling cycle.

Our experimental realization of this cooling method
(see Fig. 2) begins with an ∼ 7 ms loading cycle, dur-
ing which we load 107 atoms from a Ca beam into a
MOT (see Ref. [17] for details of our diode-laser based
MOT) using the 423 nm 1S0↔1P1 cooling transition (see
Fig. 1). After this ﬁrst cooling stage the temperature
of the atomic sample is about 2 mK (corresponding to
a vrms of 0.6 m/s), slightly above the 0.8 mK Doppler
limit. To avoid large light shifts of the ground state that
would compromise the velocity selectivity of the red cool-
ing transition, we turn oﬀ the blue trapping light for the
duration of the second-stage cooling. We then commence
QNLC with a pair of counter-propagating red pulses (2.5
µs square-shaped π-pulses), separated by 2 µs in time.
This 657 nm light is spatially ﬁltered with an optical
ﬁber and collimated to a diameter of 4 mm (8 mW in
each beam). In order to excite the m=0→m=0 transi-
tion, the light is linearly polarized parallel to the domi-
nant B-ﬁeld direction (due to a trap imbalance, the atoms
rest at a 6 G point in our magnetic ﬁeld gradient, which
remains on during the entire measurement). We tune the
laser to a frequency ∼ 350 kHz (corresponding to a ve-
locity of 23 cm/s) red of resonance so that the ﬁrst zero
of the sinc2 frequency spectrum is within 5 kHz of reso-
nance for atoms at rest. The frequency of the red light
is stabilized to an environmentally isolated, high-ﬁnesse
Fabry-Perot cavity resonance, whose drift is cancelled to
less than 0.3 kHz/minute (typical data averaging times
were about 1 minute). After the ﬁrst pair of counter-
propagating red pulses, atoms that were transferred to
the excited state are pumped to the 1S0(4s5s) m=0 state
by a 553 nm pulse (duration of ∼ 50 µs) with an eﬃciency
of ∼ 50 %. As a result of the small transition rate (we
estimate Γ(1S0(4s5s)→3P1(4s4p)) ∼ 2440(600) s−1), we
could only attain a 1/e quenching time of 55 µs, with 17
mW of green light collimated to a standing wave diame-
ter of 3 mm [18]. The frequency-stabilized green light is
generated by a dye laser in another laboratory and sent
to us via optical ﬁber. This light intersects the atoms
at an angle of ∼ 8o relative to the red cooling beams.
From the 1S0(4s5s) state the atoms decay rapidly (< 35
ns) to the ground state by way of the 1P1 state. Then
follows a second pair of counter-propagating red pulses,
but this time in reverse order (see Fig. 2) to make the
overall cooling process more symmetric. Due to the lobes
of the sinc2 frequency spectrum there is some probability
that the second pulse of a pulse pair can transfer atoms
excited by the ﬁrst red pulse back to the ground state,
making the cooling due to the ﬁrst pulse slightly less eﬃ-
cient. After the second pair of red pulses, a second green
quenching pulse follows to complete the cooling cycle. We
then repeat the cooling cycle (consisting of two pairs of
counter-propagating pulses, each followed by a standing-
wave quenching pulse) 8 to 20 times. At the end of this

2

sequence we clean out the 3P1 state with an extra green
pulse lasting 100 to 150 µs that leaves less than 3 % of
the population in the excited state. We then measure the
velocity distribution.

Our velocity probe consists of a single 657 nm pulse (10
or 20 µs in duration, depending on our desired spectral
resolution) that excites a narrow velocity slice of atoms to
the excited state. It excites the m=0→m=0 transition,
and is collinear with the red cooling beams. While contin-
uously cycling the complete measurement sequence, we
slowly sweep the frequency of the velocity probe over the
atomic velocity range to generate our distributions. We
typically average 60 sweeps of 0.5 s duration to generate a
data set. In order to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio
for these velocity distribution measurements, we use two
423 nm probe pulses in a normalized shelving detection
scheme that we developed for our optical clock (see Fig.
2) [17].

In Figure 3 we show the eﬀect of 15 cooling cycles taken
with a red pulse length of 2.5 µs and a green pulse length
of 50 µs. We see that the QNLC process transfers most
of the atoms in the range of 30 cm/s into the narrow
peak at zero velocity, consistent with the expected mo-
mentum transfer from our cooling pulses. A Gaussian ﬁt
to the central peak yielded a vrms of 6 cm/s, or about
4 recoils at 657 nm, corresponding to a 1-D temperature
of 17 µK. The transfer eﬃciency can be estimated by
comparing the area of the peak to the area of the initial
distribution - in this case we ﬁnd 30 % transfer. How-
ever, since approximately half of the atoms have escaped
the interaction region since we ﬁrst turned oﬀ the trap-
ping beams, we have a net eﬃciency closer to 15 % (we
have seen net eﬃciencies as high as 18 %). Fast ballis-
tic expansion due to our warm initial temperature causes
the atoms to move into weaker parts of the laser beams
during the cooling and probe periods. Because of laser
power constraints, we are unable to increase the beam
sizes, thus the number of cooling cycles we can use is
severely limited.

Indeed, when more cooling cycles are used, we
see increased transfer eﬃciency and narrower distribu-
tions (as was demonstrated in Raman cooling experi-
ments [4,15,16]). However the longer cooling time re-
quired means more atoms are lost transverse to the cool-
ing direction. We experimented with using more cooling
cycles with less eﬃcient quenching and found that the
central peak was fairly insensitive over the range from 18
cycles with 30 µs quenching time to 8 cycles with 70 µs
quenching time (keeping the total cooling time approxi-
mately ﬁxed at 1.5 ms).

The 14 cm/s width of the central peak in Fig. 3 is a
result of the convolution of the velocity distribution and
the velocity probe. Data taken at higher probe resolu-
tion indicate that vrms for these conditions is less than
4 cm/s (7.5 µK). To strive for colder temperatures, we
increased the red pulse length to 5 µs to give a sharper

velocity discriminator. Figure 4 shows a velocity distri-
bution resulting from 10 cooling cycles using these longer
cooling pulses. To keep the 657 nm pulse area constant
for these measurements, we chose to double the size of the
red beams rather than reduce their power in an eﬀort to
increase their pumping eﬃciency. We also adjusted the
detuning to ∼ -173 kHz (corresponding to 11.4 cm/s) to
place the zero of the excitation function at zero veloc-
ity.
Indeed, we see narrower distributions under these
conditions (we estimate a deconvolved value of vrms <
2.8 cm/s, corresponding to temperature of 3.7 µK) and
the expected smaller fraction of atoms in the peak (7
% net eﬃciency) due to the reduced range of velocities
covered. We also see quite clearly several other nodes of
the sinc2 function that serve as additional dark velocities
where the atoms can accumulate. We fully expect that
at higher resolutions we can achieve sub-recoil temper-
atures, as was seen in the Raman cooling experiments.
Monte Carlo simulations of the cooling process (includ-
ing the recoils at 553 nm, 1.03 µm, and 423 nm) support
this expectation.

From these results, a strategy that can cool a large
fraction of the initial distribution to very cold tempera-
tures becomes evident, namely to use a series of pulses at
diﬀerent resolutions and detunings [4,15,16]. To be able
to exploit such a strategy, however, we need to acceler-
ate the cooling process. With simple scaling of the 553
nm power, we calculate that a ﬁfteen-fold increase (dye
lasers regularly supply 20x the power we currently send
to our atoms) would enable us to cool the atoms nine
times faster. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation as-
suming a 1/e pumping time of 4 µs and using multiple
red cooling pulses ranging from 2.5 to 5 µs in duration
indicate that we can expect to transfer 50 % of the atoms
into a peak with sub-recoil temperature.

Moreover, one can envision a feasible 3-D strategy in
which one cools alternately in three dimensions [15], with
each reduction in temperature eﬀectively increasing the
available cooling time. Due to the multi-recoils involved
in this experiment, it would be hard to achieve 3-D sub-
recoil temperatures due to recoil heating in transverse di-
mensions. However, with appropriate shaping of our red
pulses [15,16] a limit of several recoils seems quite fea-
sible, especially in light of the near-recoil temperatures
achieved with 3-D Raman cooling [15]. Furthermore, as
one nears the recoil limit and presumably has increased
the cooling time available, one could remove the quench-
ing and use the decay of the 3P1 state itself to reduce the
recoil eﬀect. Regardless, 3-D temperatures of a few mi-
crokelvins rather than millikelvins would greatly beneﬁt
the Ca optical frequency standard, atomic interferome-
try, and other applications.

In conclusion, we have proposed a second-stage cooling
scheme based on quenched narrow-line laser cooling. We
have used this technique to reduce the temperature of
a 40Ca atomic cloud in 1-D by a factor of 500. With

3

ample quenching power, near sub-recoil temperatures in
3-D should be possible. Moreover, this technique should
be applicable to other atoms (such as Mg) with narrow
optical transitions and available quenching transitions.

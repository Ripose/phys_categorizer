Abstract. The Trim P facility at KVI is dedicated to provide short lived radioactive isotopes
at low kinetic energies to users. It comprised different cooling schemes for a variety of energy
ranges, from GeV down to the neV scale. The isotopes are produced using beam of the AGOR
cyclotron at KVI. They are separated from the primary beam by a magnetic separator. A crucial
part of such a facility is the ability to stop and extract isotopes into a low energy beamline which
guides them to the experiment. In particular we are investigating stopping in matter and buffer
gases. After the extraction the isotopes can be stored in neutral atoms or ion traps for experiments.
Our research includes precision studies of nuclear b -decay through b -n momentum correlations as
well as searches for permanent electric dipole moments in heavy atomic systems like radium. Such
experiments offer a large potential for discovering new physics.

Short lived radioactive isotopes are interesting for several promising lines of research
and currently a number of facilities to provide the isotopes are planned or are being
set up. The research topics cover a wide range in atomic, nuclear and particle physics
[1]. At the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (KVI), Groningen, The Netherlands, we are
commissioning the TRIm P Facility (Trapped Radioactive Isotopes: m icrolaboratories for
fundamental Physics) [2], which is open to outside users.

The physics interest of the TRIm P group are tests of discrete fundamental symmetries,
i.e. charge conjugation (C), space inversion (P), and time reversal (T). In standard
theory the structure of weak interactions is V-A, which means that vector (V) and
axial vector (A) currents with opposite relative sign causing a left handed structure
and thus parity violation [3]. Other possible currents like scalar, pseudo-scalar or tensor
like are signs for new physic. They can be tested by searching for b -n correlations in
weak interactions [4]. In order to determine the neutrino momentum, the recoil to the
nucleus needs to be measured. Since the recoil energy is on the order of 100 eV, a
precision measurement of the recoil momentum can only performed when the nuclei are
suspended in a very shallow potential, which can be provided by conﬁning atoms by
light forces [5]. Particularly good candidates are 20,21Na and 18,19Ne.

Another research direction is searching for permanent electric dipole moments (edm),
which violated C and P simultaneously [6]. Any observation of an edm would be an in-
dication of physics beyond the standard model. Currently the most sensitive experiment
on a nuclear edm, was performed with 199Hg [7], which gives a limit of 2.1×10−28 ecm.
Recently Flambaum and collaborators pointed out that radium offers a large sensitivity
to edm’s due to its nuclear as well as atomic level structure [8]. Currently we are inves-

tigating the feasibility of a search for an edm using radium. Both experiments require
to produce the isotopes and to store them subsequently in a neutral atom traps. We will
describe the setup of the facility.

Isotopes of interest are produced in fragmentation or fusion-evaporation reactions
utilizing heavy ion beams from the AGOR cyclotron on ﬁxed targets, which are chosen
for optimum production rates. The production mechanism favors proton rich isotopes.
The goal is to provide a clean beam of the requested isotopes with very low background
radiations. This requires dedicated separation and isotopes selective extraction stages.
The primary heavy ion beam is separated from the reactions product in a magnetic
device, which is designed to cover a wide range from light to heavy isotopes. Through
unique magnet design we achieved a compact device. This magnetic separator has been
successfully commissioned in the fall of 2004 [9]. After the separator the reaction
products are stopped in matter, which will be discussed in below. The extraction time
from the stopping device sets the lower limit for the lifetime of the isotopes which can be
provided by the facility. We are aiming at times shorter than 1 s. After the extraction from
the stopping device the isotopes are cooled and trapped in an radio frequency buncher
cooler (RFQ-cooler). From the buncher they are transported to the experiment in an
electrostatic beamline. After neutralisation the atoms can be stored in neutral atom traps
by laser cooling and trapping methods.

A central role in the design of a facility for radioactive beams takes the cooling
from the energies of several MeV/u at the productions to the eV range. For short lived
isotopes the stopping and extraction should be minimal. Reaction products stopped in
matter will be spread over a distance given by the range straggling and initial momentum
uncertainty. There are two options.

• Stopping ions in a buffer gas, preferentially helium. The main common argument is
that the ionization potential for helium (24.5eV) is much larger than for any other
elements. Thus the neutralization of the incoming ion is energetically forbidden,
at least at low enough energies. The ionic isotope can be extracted from the buffer
gas by electrostatic guiding ﬁelds. A technical aspect is that the helium gas has to
be extremely clean. A main question is the survival of ions in a buffer gas while
they are cooled by collisions especially at high rates of incoming ions [10, 11]. This
approach is followed by groups at several accelerators because it is less dependent
on the speciﬁc element.

• Implanting in a solid which can be heated to a high temperature at which the
isotopes diffuse out of the material [12]. At high temperature the diffusion and
effusion time can be less than 1s if the stopping foils are sufﬁciently thin (≈ 1m m).
Such a thermoionizer could provide high efﬁciencies of order 1 for alkaline and
alkaline earth metals.

We have investigated the possibility of using a gas cell. While an ion traverses through
the buffer gas it changes its charge state very rapidly as it undergoes many neutralization-
reionization cycles. The neutralization has a kinematic cutoff because all isotopes have
a lower ionization potential then helium. The neutralization cross section for a singly
charged ion is maximal around an energy of about 25 keV/nucleon (Fig. 1). Below
that energy the cross section drops rapidly. The fraction of charged isotopes at thermal

energies is expected to be determined by the ratio of the ionization to neutralization
cross section. These charge exchange cross sections at low energies are important input
for the development of devices like radio frequency coolers as well as gas catcher cells
for stopping high energetic ions.

We have measured cross sections for neutralization at well as stripping cross sections
at energies below 1keV/u for different buffer gases. The survival rate strongly depends
on the composition of the buffer gas. The preferred choices for a buffer gas is highly pure
inert gases where helium stands out because of its high ionization potential of 24.5eV.

We measured the change of the charge state of multiply charged ions after passing
through a differentially pumped He gas target. Typically less than 10 collisions are
sufﬁcient to reach an equilibrium charge state distribution, while the energy loss is small
compared to the total energy. Because of the small number of collisions such a setup
is less sensitive to the purity of the gas than in a measurement where we completely
stop the ions. In Fig.2 our results for Xe on helium is plotted in addition to data at
higher energies and for different isotopes. We could extend these measurements to lower
momentum of 15×108cm u/s, respectively 80 eV/u of energy. The average charge state
is decreasing with decreasing momentum of the ions. Measurements at lower momenta
were not possible in our apparatus because of the increasing scattering angle.

For the TRIm P facility we are currently commissioning a stopping device of the
second type, since it is ideal for alkaline and alkaline earth isotopes. We plan to stopping
the ions in thin tungsten foils, which can be heated to temperatures of 2500 K were the
expected diffusion times are less than 1 s for 1m m thick foils.

After the stopping device the isotopes are extracted as ions, which allows for easy ma-
nipulation. The ions are guided by electrostatic means into a gas ﬁlled radio-frequency
buncher cooler system. It consists out of two identical segmented rfq’s of 330 mm length,
which are separated by small apertures for differential pumping purposes. The rods of
the quadrupoles are 10 mm apart and are segmented in order to apply axial ﬁeld gradient.
The segments are connected by a dc resistor chain, while the rf is capacitively coupled to

the segments. This reduces the number of electrical feedthroughs signiﬁcantly. We use
frequencies from 0.5-2 MHz and a voltage Vpp of up to 200 V, which is sufﬁcient for
the isotopes of interest. The device is housed in standard UHV double crosses (Fig. 3).
The system was commissioned using ions with energies of 10-60 eV. In the ﬁrst
section they are slowed and transversely cooled by collisions with He buffer gas of
about 3×10−2 mbar. A small drag potential of 0.5 V/cm moves the ions along the axis.
The second rfq operates at a pressure ten times lower. The axial potential has is shaped
to allow for trapping near to the exit. The potential depth is on the order of 5 V The
ions can be ejected into a pulsed drift tube accelerator by switching the last electrode by
several ten volt. Preliminary measurements indicate that we ﬁnd more than 60% of the
ions entering the device are transferred into the drift tube. The drift tube is pulsed and
the ion pulse is detected by a micro channel plate in the low energy beamline. The pulse
width is in the order of several hundredths of ns in agreement with simulations. The ion
pulse can then be transported in an electrostatic beamline to the experiments.

The ultimate cooling of the radioactive isotopes is provided in neutral atom traps.
Here, atoms are well localized at typical temperatures of the order of m K. Storage times
in a MOT depends on the particular atom and the background pressure and Na trapping
times of more than 100 s have been achieved. Recently the ﬁrst Na MOT for TRIm P
has been brought into operation. An advantage of optical trapping is that it allows to
manipulate the state of the systems. The limitation of laser cooling are that the forces
are rather small and atomic level scheme has to be suitable. Thus we are developing new
laser cooling schemes for atoms like radium, extending the list of trapable atoms.

Research with trapped rare isotopes offer unique possibilities for testing fundamental
interactions in a complementary way to high energy physics. Atomic physics techniques

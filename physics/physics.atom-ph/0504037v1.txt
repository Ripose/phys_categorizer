We provide a basis for the laser intensity dependence of the momentum distributions of electrons
and ions arising from strong-ﬁeld non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) at intensities in the range
I = 1 − 6.5 × 1014W/cm2. To do this we use a completely classical method introduced previously
[1]. Our calculated results reproduce the features of experimental observations at diﬀerent laser
intensities and depend on just two distinct categories of electon trajectories.

When atoms with two or more electrons are exposed
to an ultra-short (10-600 femtoseconds) and ultra-strong
1014W/cm2) laser pulse, two electrons can be
(1
ripped oﬀ from the nucleus. This strong-ﬁeld double ion-
ization process has been observed in all inert gas atoms
[2, 3, 4] and some molecules [5]. The remarkable aspect
of this process is its strong electron pair correlation. Un-
correlated electrons are ionized sequentially, each event
well explained by single-ionization theory [6]. This se-
quential ionization theory cannot explain a characteris-
tic knee-like structure observed in the double-ionization
yield (see Fig. 1) as a function of laser intensity, so this
process is usually known as nonsequential double ioniza-
tion (NSDI).

In addition to ion yield, experiments in the intensity
regime of the knee-like structure have examined recoil
ion momentum distributions in which the shape depends
strongly on laser intensity [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Distri-
butions for diﬀerent atomic species (helium, neon and ar-
gon) show diﬀerent shape variations as a function of laser

longitudinal direction for He2+ [13] and Ar2+ [9] at diﬀerent

mentum distributions of Ne2+ at the end of this paper.

intensity, as shown in Fig. 2: at low laser intensities there
are more low-momentum or zero-momentum ions, giving
a narrow distribution peaked at zero momentum, whereas
at higher laser intensity the high-momentum ions become
more dominant and the distribution becomes broader.

A variety of theoretical initiatives have been pursued
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] with the goal of understand-
ing NSDI eﬀects including ion yield and ﬁnal-state mo-
menta. With the exception of the calculations made by
the Taylor group that are applicable only to helium [15],
all have ad hoc elements that are not easy to justify
fully, and none have successfully dealt with the intensity-
dependence of the shapes of the experimental momentum
distributions shown in Fig. 2.

Recently we pursued a fully classical theory [1] as an
explanation for the electron correlation in NSDI and sug-
gested that the major features of NSDI arise naturally
without needing to engage quantum processes at all, not
even tunnelling as the initial step in NSDI. In such a
treatment the NSDI process is a consequence of both elec-

FIG. 3: Plots of electron energy versus time measured in laser cycles, showing four distinct stages of NSDI. We show a variety of
histories of two-electron trajectory that lead to double ionization. One can identify four universal stages, which are embedded
in these diﬀerent histories of evolution. A trajectory is labelled as NZ and Z if both electrons moving away from the nucleus

trons actively responding to the laser ﬁeld and to each
other and to the nuclear attraction, undergoing ordinary
(but complicated) Hamiltonian dynamics throughout the
duration of the laser pulse. As one consequence, double
ionization can be easily seen to occur in four universal
stages (see Fig. 3).

In this brief note we provide calculational evidence
supporting a classical
interpretation of the intensity-
dependent changes in the shape of ion recoil momentum
distributions that are shown in Fig. 2. The calculations
suggest the active presence of two distinct categories of
two-electron ejection from the atom, loosely speaking as-
sociated with back to back ejection on the one hand and
side by side ejection on the other hand. In the ﬁrst case
one can expect that little net momentum will be carried
by the pair and in the second case the net electron mo-
mentum can be substantial. For ease of description we
have labelled these as the Z and NZ categories [1, 20],
meaning “zero” and “non-zero” momentum to impart to
the ion.

Our approach will be to display the results of entirely
classical calculations of the NSDI electron trajectories as
evidence that the Z-NZ distinction exists, and then show
that it explains the origin of the laser intensity depen-
dence of the shape of the momentum distributions shown
in Fig. 2.

response of each electron is restricted to the axis of the
laser polarization, will be adequate. All of the relevant
experimental data is for linearly polarized laser light,
which is the vast majority of available data. We also
use the so-called Rochester screened Coulomb potential
1/√x2 + 1 to model the nuclear binding

potential and electron-electron repulsion potential. We
have previously shown that the character of the NSDI
process (recall Fig. 3) obtained using this 1d model does
not diﬀer much from that of 3d [1]. In addition, Haan,
et al. have shown that there are striking similarities in
the dynamical evolution of the classical ensemble calcula-
tions and the corresponding quantum 2-e wave functions
[23, 24].

Each electron pair is given a diﬀerent set of initial con-
ditions but each pair is given an initial energy of -2.24
a.u., which corresponds to the energy of the two-electron
quantum ground state. We use E(t) =
0f (t) sin ωt to

780 nm (frequency ω = 0.0584 a.u.) and a trapezoidal
envelope with 2-cycle turn-on and turn-oﬀ.

II. CLASSICAL ENSEMBLE METHOD

We use the classical ensemble method that has been
described in detail by Panﬁli, et al. [21]. The idea is to
use a large number of classical electron pairs (100,000 -
500,000 members) to model the dynamical evolution of a
two-electron system exposed to an intense laser ﬁeld.

We are interested only in the forward-backward as-
pects of the recoil ion momentum, what is measured as
the longitudinal momentum (i.e., along the axis of the
laser polarization). This means that the one-dimensional
aligned-electron approximation (AEA) [22], in which the

distributions for the Z and NZ pairs, and these distribu-
tions are found to have diﬀerent shapes, and also diﬀer-
ent behaviors as a function of intensity. The calculated
shapes are shown with their intensity dependences in Fig.
5. In both categories the shapes broaden with increasing
intensity, more so in the NZ case. More signiﬁcantly, in
both categories the peak of the distribution drops with
increasing intensity, but this eﬀect is much stronger for
the Z category. Analysis of the time evolution of Z and
NZ trajectories, and their relative ability to produce the
NSDI “jets” that have been discussed previously [23, 24],
will be reported separately.

The combined result of broadening and peak-height
decrease is a predicted substantial shift in probability in
favor of the NZ category. As shown in Fig. 6, the rel-
ative probability P(Z) - P(NZ) is predicted to change
sign as the intensity exceeds a few times 1014 watts/cm2,
ﬁrst strongly favoring the Z category at low intensity and
1014 watts/cm2 strongly favor-
then above about I
ing the NZ category. This correlates with the change in
appearance of the panels in Fig. 4 and we can see that
this Z
NZ shift is adequate to explain the shape varia-
tion with increasing intensity in the experimental curves
shown in Fig. 2. Additional quantitative comparisons
can be obtained if the Z and NZ data are combined to
make calculated total-momentum distributions.

the range in some of the experiments. Details of the dis-
tributions depend to a degree on the deﬁnition of double
ionization, as explained already in Fig. 4, but the main
characteristics are quite stable. By comparing our calcu-
lated results with those measured experimentally (recall
the data in Fig. 2), we ﬁnd the following similarities in
the laser intensity dependence of the shape of the mo-
mentum distribution:
(1) The width of the distribution increases with the
laser intensity. The helium experiment shows that the
base width of the distribution changes from 8 a.u. at
1014W/cm2, and
3.5
the argon experiment shows that the base width of the
1014W/cm2
distribution changes from 10 a.u. at 2.0
to more than 12 a.u.
Sim-
ilarly, our calculated distribution has the base width
1014W/cm2. This width is
of 6 a.u.
raised more than 50% trajectories to about 10 a.u. at
I = 6.5
(2) More low or zero momentum ions are observed at low
laser intensities, whereas more high or nonzero momen-
tum ions are observed at high laser intensities. Such a
transition is clearly illustrated both in the experiment
and our calculation,
in which the side peaks become
higher and wider as the laser intensity increases.

One can see from the calculated two-electron momen-
tum distributions that four NZ regions near one axis but
relatively far from the origin have the highest density of
NZ trajectories, and two Z regions near the origin have

ized electrons at various intensities. These are density plots
in log scale, in which regions with darker color have relatively
higher densities of two-electron trajectories. The box size in
the ﬁgures is much smaller than the computational zone and
was chosen for ease of viewing. It does not represent a bound-
ary for the electrons. Notice that there are no trajectories
close to the two axes due to our deﬁnition of double ioniza-
tion, in which an electron is considered ionized if its kinetic
energy is greater than its nuclear binding potential energy
[23]. If the deﬁnition is modiﬁed, the ﬁne details of these dis-
tributions will change but the main features will remain the
same.

III. CALCULATED MOMENTUM
DISTRIBUTIONS OF IONS AND ELECTRONS

Calculations based on the ensemble method provide a
wealth of “experimental” information at every intensity.
Fig. 4 shows the two-electron momentum plane at the
end of the laser pulse for each of six diﬀerent laser inten-
sities. The planes contains dense distributions of doubly
ionized electron-pair points. Electron pairs with oppo-
site momenta (Z category) produce points in the second
and fourth quadrants, and electron pairs moving together
(NZ category) provide the points in the ﬁrst and third
quadrants. These points yield theoretical ion momentum

calculated by ﬁrst projecting the two-electron momentum points in Fig. 4 onto the diagonal axis. The raw data projections

probabilities plotted here.

the highest density of Z trajectories. The presence of
these densely populated regions indicates that the mo-
menta of two electrons are correlated. We ﬁnd that our
classical calculations show similarities with the quantum
results of Lein, et al . [25], obtained by solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the same model with
similar parameters. The locations of the highest density
two-electron trajectories are in good agreement with the
quantum calculations. This is a further conﬁrmation that
the dynamics of two electrons in a strong laser ﬁeld has
deﬁnite classical attributes.

IV. SUMMARY

We have used a completely classical method to inves-
tigate the laser intensity dependence of the momentum
distributions of electrons and ions. Based on the ﬁnal

ferent laser intensities. Note that P(Z) and P(NZ) indicate

height and width of their distributions depend on the
laser intensity. Thus, these two types of trajectories act
as a basis to give diﬀerent shapes of the ion momentum
distributions at diﬀerent laser intensities. Our calculated
results showed that the Z trajectories are more favorable
at low laser intensities, whereas the NZ trajectories are
NZ
more favorable at high laser intensities. This Z
shift has been demonstrated in the helium and argon ex-
periments.

Currently, the available experimental ion momentum
distributions of neon show a double-peak structure, and
its width decreases with decreasing laser intensity within
the NSDI regime (see [8, 12, 13]). Since this shape and
its variation are consistent with the behavior of the NZ
distribution, we suggest that these neon data are in the
intensity regime that favors the production of NZ trajec-
tories [26]. By lowering the laser intensity further, our
analysis suggests that experiment on neon could observe
a sngle-peak momentum distribution that has dominant
Z ions.

tions of the Z and NZ trajectories are very diﬀerent, in
which the Z and NZ trajectories produce single-peak and
double-peak structures respectively. Furthermore, the

Abstract

Interference between the halves of a double-well trap containing a Bose-Einstein condensate is

studied. It is found that when the atoms in the two wells are initially in the coherent state, the

intensity exhibits collapses and revivals, but it does not for the initial Fock states. Whether the

initial states are in the coherent states or in a Fock states, the ﬁdelity time has nothing to do

with collision. We point out that interference and its ﬁdelity can be adjusted experimentally by

properly preparing the number and initial states of the system.

INTRODUCTION

Since the recent experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation in small atomic

samples [1, 2, 3, 4], there has been much theoretical interest focused on the physical prop-

erties and nature of Bose-Einstein condensed systems such as coherent tunneling, the col-

lapses and revivals in both the macroscopic wave function and the interference patterns

[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

It is hoped that the study of those experimental systems will

give new insight into the physics of BEC. Since the current understanding of BEC is largely

inﬂuenced by the concept of a macroscopic wave function, the study of this feature is of fore-

most importance. The investigation of interference phenomena should be perfectly suited for

this purpose. Another motivation for the study of interference properties is the envisioned

development of a new source of atoms, based on BEC, with high ﬂux and coherence. It is

expected to stimulate atomic interference experiments.

Recently, Javanainen et al.

[13] have theoretically studied atom number ﬂuctuations

between the halves of a double-well trap containing a Bose-Einstein condensate, in which

the two-mode approximation is used, which assumes that only two one-particle states are

involved. They have developed an analytical harmonic-oscillator-like model and veriﬁed

numerically for both stationary ﬂuctuations in the ground state of the system, and for the

ﬂuctuations resulting from splitting of a single trap by dynamically erecting a barrier in the

This paper is organized as follows. Sec.II gives the solution of model. Sec. III studies

collapses and revivals of interference intensity. Sec. IV investigates ﬁdelity of interference.

A conclusion is given in the last section.

middle.

II. MODEL

In a symmetric double-well potential, the ground state of a single particle is represented

by an even wave function ψg that belongs equally to both wells of the potential. Provided

that barrier between the halves of the potential is tall enough so that the tunneling rate

between the potential wells is small, nearby lies an excited odd state ψe that likewise belongs

to both halves of the double well. The starting point is that we take only two one-particle

states ψg and ψe to be available to the N bosons. The reason for this choice of including

2

only the two lowest lying modes for the double-well potential is that the other modes are

energetically inaccessible.

We adopt the usual two-particle contact interaction U(r1, r2) = (4π~2a/m)δ(r1 −
where a is the s-wave scattering length and m the atomic mass. Given the restricted state

assume that the wave functions ψe,g are real. To simplify the discussion, we set K12 = K11 =

which show that the ﬁdelity time is not only related to the initial state of the system, but

also to the dissipation parameters.

Furthermore, we can get the ﬁdelity loss rates:

˜L(cs) = 0, ˜L(F s) = 2nγ1 + 2mγ2,

which indicate that when the atoms in the two wells are initially in the coherent state, the
ﬁdelity loss rate of interference is zero, but for the initial Fock state, ˜L(F s) is related to the

initial particle number of the system and the dissipation parameters, but not to the collision

parameters.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied interference between the halves of a double-well trap containing a BEC.

It is found that when the atoms in the two wells are initially in the coherent state, the

intensity exhibits collapses and revivals, but it does not for the initial Fock states. The

interference intensity is aﬀected by the collision and dissipation, but for the initial Fock

state, it is only related to the dissipation. Whether the initial states are in the coherent

states or in a Fock states, the ﬁdelity time has nothing to do with collision. For the initial

coherent states, the ﬁdelity loss rate is zero, but for the initial Fock states, it is determined

by the initial particle number of the system and dissipation. This shows that interference

and its ﬁdelity can be adjusted experimentally by properly preparing the number and initial

states of the system.

It is pointed out that the recent realization of a superﬂuid-Mott-insulator phase transition

in a gas of ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice[15] is very similar to the state preparation

assumed in this paper, we hope our results obtained above will be useful to study Mott

insulator phase transition in the future.

We present here a new method based on a transfer of population by adiabatic passage that allows
to prepare cold atomic samples with a well deﬁned ratio of atomic density and atom number. This
method is used to perform a measurement of the cold collision frequency shift in a laser cooled
cesium clock at the percent level, which makes the evaluation of the cesium fountains accuracy at
−16 level realistic. With an improved set-up, the adiabatic passage would allow measurements
the 10
of atom number-dependent phase shifts at the 10−3 level in high precision experiments.

PACS numbers: 32.88.Pj, 06.30.Ft, 34.20.Cf

Collisions play an important role in high precision
atomic interferometry [1,2]. In most experiments, a pre-
cise control of the atomic density is hard to achieve,
which sets a limit to how accurately systematic eﬀects
due to collisions can be corrected for. This is particu-
larly true for clocks using laser cooled Cs atoms [3,4]. The
accuracy of the BNM SYRTE cesium fountains reaches
now ∼ 1 × 10−15. It is currently limited by a 10 to 20
% systematic and statistical uncertainty on the deter-
mination of the cold collision shift [5–7]. To reach such
an accuracy, one has to operate with a moderate num-
ber of detected atoms, typically 105, which sets a stan-
dard quantum limit to the frequency stability [8] of about
10−13τ −1/2, where τ is the averaging time in seconds.
However, when using a high number of atoms (106 −107),
a stability approaching 3 × 10−14τ −1/2 has already been
demonstrated [7,8], which would make the evaluation at
the 10−16 level practicable. Under these conditions, the
cold collision frequency shift is very large (∼ 10−14). To
actually reach such an accuracy and to take full advan-
tage of this capability, this shift has to be determined
more accurately than presently achieved.

In this letter, we present a method using adiabatic pas-
sage (AP) [9,10] that allows to prepare atomic samples
with well deﬁned density ratios. This enables the deter-
mination of the collisional frequency shift at the percent
level, or better.

The measurement of the cold collision shift is based
on a diﬀerential method [11]. One alternates sequences
of measurements with two diﬀerent, high and low eﬀec-
tive atomic densities. One then measures the frequency
diﬀerence between the two situations, as well as the dif-
ference in the number of detected atoms. Knowing the
eﬀective densities, the clock frequency can be corrected
for the collisional shift by extrapolation to zero density.
Unfortunately, the eﬀective density cannot be measured
in a fountain, one only measures the number
directly :
of detected atoms. A full numerical simulation (which
takes into account the whole geometry of the fountain

and the parameters of the atomic cloud) is then neces-
sary to estimate the eﬀective density, as in [11]. Never-
theless, extrapolating the clock frequency to zero density
is still possible if one assumes that the eﬀective density
and the number of detected atoms are proportional. Un-
der these conditions, the collisional frequency shift δν is
proportional to the number of detected atoms Ndet, say
δν = KNdet. The important point is that the coeﬃcient
K should be the same for the low and high density con-
ﬁgurations, otherwise the extrapolation to zero detected
atoms is inaccurate.

Up to now, two methods have been used to change the
density, and hence Ndet. Atoms are initially loaded in
an optical molasses, whose parameters (duration, laser
intensity) can be varied. A better technique consists in
keeping the same loading parameters but changing the
power in a selection microwave cavity, which is used
to prepare atoms in the |F = 3, mF = 0i state. One
can select all (resp. half) of the atoms initially in the
|F = 4, mF = 0i state by applying a π (resp. π/2) pulse.
However, due to the microwave ﬁeld inhomogeneities in
the cavity, the pulses cannot be perfectly π and π/2
pulses for all the atoms. Both techniques aﬀect the
atomic densities, velocity distribution and collisional en-
ergy [12], and consequently the K coeﬃcients usually dif-
fer for the low and high density cases. Numerical simu-
lations show that the K coeﬃcient may diﬀer by 10% to
15% in our set-up, depending on parameters such as mi-
crowave power, velocity and position distribution. Fluc-
tuations and imperfect determination of those parame-
ters prevent from performing an accurate evaluation of
the K coeﬃcient.

A method immune of these systematic eﬀects pre-
scribes to change the number of atoms of the sample
without changing neither its velocity distribution, nor its
size. This can be realized by an adiabatic transfer of pop-
ulation, which allows one to prepare two atomic samples,
where both the ratio of the eﬀective densities and the ra-
tio of the atom numbers are exactly 1/2. In contrast to

1

previous methods, this one is insensitive to ﬂuctuations
of experimental parameters such as the size and temper-
ature of the atomic sample, or the power coupled into
the selection cavity.

First, an adiabatic passage in the selection cavity is
used to transfer with a 100% eﬃciency all the atoms from
the |F = 4, mF = 0i state to the |F = 3, mF = 0i state
[9,10]. This requires that the microwave ﬁeld in the cavity
is swept across resonance, and that the Rabi frequency
Ω/2π has an appropriate shape and maximum intensity.
We choose to use Blackman pulses (BP), following [13],
which minimizes oﬀ-resonance excitation.
In order to
fulﬁll the adiabaticity condition, the frequency chirp δ
has to be shaped according to

δ(t) ∝

Z

Ω2(t)dt.

(1)

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the microwave ﬁeld am-
plitude together with the frequency chirp.

Second, we exploit another striking property of AP. If
we stop the AP sequence when δ = 0 (half-Blackman
pulse HBP), the atoms are left in a superposition of
the |F = 4, mF = 0i and |F = 3, mF = 0i states, with
weights rigourously equal and independent of the Rabi
frequency. After removal of the |F = 4i atoms with
a pushing laser beam, half of the atoms are in the
|F = 3, mF = 0i state, as desired.

In order to optimize this AP method and to evaluate
its sensitivity to experimental parameters, we ﬁrst per-
formed a simple numerical simulation, solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation for a two level atom in
a homogeneous microwave ﬁeld. The choice of the pulse
parameters comes from a compromise between the in-
sensitivity of the transition probabilities to ﬂuctuations
and the parasitic excitation of non-resonant transitions.
Figure 2 displays as lines the calculated transition prob-
abilities as a function of the maximum Rabi frequency
Ωmax/2π, for BP and HBP. The parameters were a dura-
tion τint = 4 ms, and δmax = 5 kHz, which were constant
over the course of the experiment. The simulation shows
that the transition probabilities deviate from 1 and 1/2
by less than 10−3 as soon as Ωmax/2π is larger than 2.4
kHz. A more realistic simulation has been performed,
taking into account the gaussian spatial distribution of
the atomic cloud (characterized by σ = 3.5 mm) in the
selection cavity, its trajectory in the microwave cavity,
as well as the microwave ﬁeld distribution of the TE011
mode for our cylindrical cavity. The simulation indicates
that the transition probability deviates from the ideal
value by less than 10−3 for both BP and HBP for all the
atoms contained within ±3.5σ of the vertical spatial dis-
tribution (more than 99.95 % of the atoms in the cloud).
In this calculation, δ = 0 when the center of the cloud
reaches the center of the cavity, which minimizes the sen-
sitivity of the transfer eﬃciency to microwave ﬁeld inho-
mogeneities and timing errors. For instance, a delay as

large as 1 ms with respect to the optimal timing induces
only a 7 × 10−5 variation on the transition probability.
The only critical parameter is the accuracy of the fre-
quency at the end of the chirp δ0, for HBP. We calculate
a linear sensitivity of the transition probability to δ0 of
7 × 10−5/Hz.

We use one of our Cs fountain to demonstrate the
AP method and the resulting ability to control the col-
lisional shift. This clock is an improved version of the
Rb fountain already described elsewhere [7,14]. We use
a laser slowed atomic beam to load about 109 atoms
within 800 ms in a lin ⊥ lin optical molasses, with 6
laser beams tuned to the red of the F = 4 → F ′ = 5
transition at 852 nm. The atoms are then launched up-
wards at ∼ 4.1 m/s within 2 ms, and cooled down to
an eﬀective temperature of ∼ 1µK. After launch, the
atoms are prepared into the |F = 3, mF = 0i state us-
ing a combination of microwave and laser pulses : they
ﬁrst enter a selection cavity (Q ∼1000) tuned to the
|F = 4, mF = 0i → |F = 3, mF = 0i transition, where
they experience either BP or HBP pulses. The atoms
left in the F = 4 state are pushed by a laser beam tuned
to the F = 4 → F ′ = 5 transition, 10 cm above the selec-
tion cavity. The amplitude of the pulses are shaped by
applying an adequate voltage sequence (500 steps) to a
microwave voltage-controlled attenuator (60 dB dynamic
range), whereas the frequency chirp is performed with a
voltage controlled oscillator. The Rabi frequency proﬁle
agrees with the expected Blackman shape within a few
percent. The frequency chirp, and more speciﬁcally its
ﬁnal frequency, was not controlled as it cannot be eas-
ily checked at the required precision level of 10 Hz for
HBP. The selected atoms then interact with a 9.2 GHz
microwave ﬁeld synthesized from a high frequency sta-
bility quartz oscillator weakly locked to the output of a
H-maser. The two π/2 Ramsey interactions are separated
by 500 ms. The number of atoms NF =3 and NF =4 are ﬁ-
nally measured by time of ﬂight ﬂuorescence, induced by
a pair of laser beams located below the molasses region.
From the transition probabilities NF =4/(NF =3 + NF =4)
measured on both sides of the central Ramsey fringe, an
error signal is computed to lock the microwave interro-
gation frequency to the atomic transition using a digital
servo loop.

The transition probabilities are ﬁrst measured as a
function of the maximum Rabi frequency Ωmax, for the
Blackman and half-Blackman pulses. The atoms are
launched and selected with the pushing beam oﬀ for
this evaluation phase only. To reject the ﬂuctuations
of the initial number of atoms, we measure the ratio of
the atoms transferred into |F = 3, mF = 0i and the to-
tal number of launched atoms, in all magnetic sub-levels.
We then rescale the transfer probability in between 0 and
1 using only one free parameter : the initial population
of the |F = 4, mF = 0i state. The results are shown in
ﬁgure 2 and reproduce very well the numerical simula-

2

tions.

As the maximum Rabi frequency during the experi-
ment was set to 7.5 kHz, the resonance frequencies for
transitions between mF 6= 0 states have to be signiﬁ-
cantly shifted away from the 0-0 transition. A magnetic
ﬁeld of ∼ 180 mG is applied during the pulses which
keeps the parasitic excitation of magnetic ﬁeld sensitive
transitions below 0.3 %. This pulse induces a quadratic
Zeeman shift on the 0-0 transition of about 14 Hz than
must be taken into account to meet the resonance condi-
tion δ = 0 for HBP.

For each sequence of the diﬀerential measurement, we
measure the mean atom number for the Blackman and
half-Blackman pulses, and compute their ratio R. We
then calculate RN , the average of R for N successive se-
quences. In ﬁgure 3, the standard deviation σR(N ) for
various N is plotted. The stability of R reaches 3 × 10−4
after a one-day integration. This reﬂects the insensitivity
of the AP to the experimental parameter ﬂuctuations.
The mean value of the ratio is R = 0.506, whereas it
was expected to be 0.5 at the 10−3 level. This devia-
tion cannot be explained by a non-linearity of the de-
tection, which could arise from absorption in the detec-
tion beams. When the absorption in the detection laser
beams is changed by a factor 2, we observe no change
in the ratio larger than 10−3. We attribute this de-
viation to the uncertainty in the ﬁnal frequency of the
sweep. In our present set-up, the sweep is generated by
an oscillator whose accuracy is limited to 50 Hz for a fre-
quency sweep from -5 to +5 kHz (this diﬃculty can be
solved by using a dedicated DDS numerical synthesizer).
We measure a linear deviation in the transition probabil-
ity of 7.5(3) × 10−5/Hz in agreement with the predicted
value. This can explain a deviation of the ratio by about
4 × 10−3. However, it is important to notice that even
when the ﬁnal frequency is detuned by 50 Hz, the spatial
variation of the transition probability across the atomic
sample is less than 10−3. All the tests performed here
demonstrate that AP is at least accurate at the 1% level.
Measurements of the collisional frequency shift are
then carried out using BP and HBP pulses with a large
number of atoms (Ndet ∼ 107) in order to amplify the
collisional shift. From a diﬀerential measurement, one
can extrapolate the frequency of the clock at zero den-
sity with respect to the H-maser. The relative resolution
of the frequency diﬀerence is 2 × 10−13τ −1/2, limited by
the phase noise of the quartz oscillator used for the foun-
tain interrogation. To check whether this extrapolation is
correct, we measure the corrected frequency for two dif-
ferent initial temperatures of the atomic cloud, 1.1 and
2.3 µK, for which the eﬀective densities, number of de-
tected atoms and K coeﬃcients are expected to be dif-
ferent. We switch every 50 cycles between four diﬀerent
conﬁgurations : 1.1 µK and BP, 1.1 µK and HBP, 2.3 µK
and BP, 2.3 µK and HBP. This rejects long term ﬂuctua-
tions in the experiment induced by frequency drift of the

H-maser used as a reference, variation of the detection
responsivity, and ﬂuctuations of other systematic eﬀects.
The results are summarized in table I. For each con-
ﬁguration, the measurement of the clock frequency and
number of atoms is averaged over a total time of about
50 hours. One can then extract the diﬀerential collisional
shifts with a relative resolution of 5 × 10−16. The K con-
stants are thus determined with an uncertainty of about
1 %. They are found to diﬀer by about 20 %. The diﬀer-
ence between the corrected frequencies can then be esti-
mated. The uncertainty on this measurement is two-fold,
a statistical uncertainty, and a systematic error which re-
ﬂects the 1 % uncertainty on the ratio R. We ﬁnd a dif-
ference between the corrected frequencies of -0.012(7)(5)
mHz, which is less than 2 % of the collisional shift at high
density, and compatible with zero within its error bars.
Table II displays the results obtained using either the
standard selection method (SSM) or AP, for a temper-
ature of 1.1µK. The K coeﬃcients are found to dif-
Indeed, when using a π/2 pulse
fer by about 10%.
with the standard selection, the density distribution is
transversally distorted : atoms along the symmetry axis
of the cavity are more eﬃciently transferred than oﬀ-axis
atoms. This increases the eﬀective density for the same
number of detected atoms with respect to AP, giving a
larger collision shift at low density. In fact, K is expected
to be lower with SSM than AP, in agreement with our
measurement. Extrapolating the frequency to zero den-
sity when using SSM then leads to an error of about
3 × 10−15 at this density.

It is also important to notice that we measure simulta-
neously the collisional frequency shift and the shift due to
cavity pulling [15], which is proportional to the number
of atoms crossing the Ramsey cavity. Both are correctly
evaluated by our method.

In conclusion, we demonstrate here a powerful method
based on an adiabatic transfer of population to prepare
atomic samples with a well-deﬁned density ratio. An im-
portant point is that the cold collisional shift is measured
precisely without any absolute calibration, nor numeri-
cal simulation. This holds even when parameters of the
atomic sample, or even of the atomic detection are ﬂuc-
tuating. This method can lead to a potential control of
the cold collision shift at the 10−3 level, or even better.
This capability could be demonstrated by using an ul-
tra stable cryogenic oscillator [8], allowing a frequency
resolution of 10−16 per day. Having now at hand a pow-
erful method to determine the collisional shift with the
required resolution, the evaluation of the Cs fountain ac-
curacy at the 10−16 level is reachable. Any other high
precision measurement using cold atoms should also ben-
eﬁt from this method to evaluate phase shifts induced by
atomic interactions.

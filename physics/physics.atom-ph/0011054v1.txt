The quenching processes of the thermalized ortho-positronium(o-Ps) on an oxygen molecule
have been studied by the positron annihilation age-momentum correlation techinique(AMOC). The
Doppler broadening spectrum of the 511 keV γ-rays from the 2γ annihilation of o-Ps in O2 has been
measured as a function of the o-Ps age. The rate of the quenching, consisting of the pickoﬀ and the
spin-conversion, is estimated from the positron lifetime spectrum. The ratio of the pickoﬀ quench-
ing rate to the spin-conversion rate is deduced from the Doppler broadening of the 511 keV γ-rays
from the annihilation of the o-Ps. The pickoﬀ parameter 1Zeﬀ , the eﬀective number of the electrons
per molecule which contribute to the pickoﬀ quenching, for O2 is determined to be 0.6 ± 0.4. The

cross-section for the elastic spin-conversion quenching is determined to be (1.16 ± 0.01) × 10

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently the annihilation of the low energy positrons
on collision with various gas molecules has been stud-
ied systematically by Surko and his collaborators [1, 2].
They have measured the annihilation rate, λ+, of the
thermalized positron and estimated the positron annihi-
lation parameter, Zeﬀ , deﬁned as

λ+ = πr2

0cnZeﬀ ,

(1)

where r0 is the classical electron radius, c is the speed
of light, and n is the number density of the molecules.
The Zeﬀ has been revealed to be very sensitive to small
changes in the molecular structure and increasing para-
metrically from 1 to 107 [2].

A parameter similar to Zeﬀ is deﬁned for the case of
the positronium(Ps) annihilation in gases. It is related
to the pickoﬀ quenching of the ortho-positronium(o-Ps)
and called 1Zeﬀ. This parameter represents the eﬀective
number of the electrons per molecule in a spin singlet
state relative to the positron in the o-Ps [3, 4, 5]. The
pickoﬀ quenching rate is expressed as

λpickoﬀ = 4πr2

0cn1Zeﬀ .

(2)

The values of 1Zeﬀ for various gases reported so far are
collected in Ref. [5]. They lie, except for O2, between 0.1
and 1.3, very small in contrast to Zeﬀ .

In a paramagnetic gas such as O2, o-Ps can be also
quenched by spin-conversion, i.e., the conversion of o-Ps
into para-positronium(p-Ps) followed by its prompt self-
annihilation [6, 7, 8]. There exists two kinds of Ps spin-
conversion processes in O2. One excites the O2 molecule
to the excited state a1∆g (or b1Σ+
g ), and thus may be

∗Electronic address: shino@rsaixsv.icepp.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp

called inelastic conversion. This process is active when
the energy of the Ps is larger than 0.977eV (or 1.62eV).
The other leaves the O2 molecule in the ground state
X 3Σ−
g and may be called elastic conversion. The latter
process has no threshold and thus active for the thermal-
ized o-Ps. These two spin-conversions have quite diﬀerent
cross-sections [7, 8]; the cross-section for the former is on
the order of 10−16cm2, and that for the latter is on the
order of 10−19cm2 [8].

In Ref. [5], the quenching rate of o-Ps in O2 including
the eﬀect of the spin-conversion is expressed in terms of
1Zeﬀ as 44 ± 3. The proper 1Zeﬀ deﬁned by Eq. (2) is not
known. In order to measure this, the pickoﬀ quenching
has to be separated from the spin-conversion.

In the present work, we obtain the 1Zeﬀ and the
spin-conversion cross-section for O2 by positron anni-
hilation age-momentum correlation technique(AMOC).
The AMOC consists in a correlated measurement of the
positron lifetime and the energy of the annihilation γ-
rays. The Doppler broadening spectrum of the 511 keV
γ-rays from the 2γ annihilation of the o-Ps in O2 has
been measured as a function of the time that the o-Ps
atoms have spent from their formation to annihilation.
The 2γ annihilation in the time range in which only
o-Ps exists results either from the pickoﬀ quenching or
from the self-annihilation of the p-Ps created through the
spin-conversion. The 1Zeﬀ and the spin-conversion cross-
section are determined by separating the pickoﬀ quench-
ing from the spin-conversion.

Preliminary results with a diﬀerent setup were re-

ported in Ref. [9].

II. EXPERIMENTAL

The experimental setup is shown schematically in
Fig. 1. A 0.5 µCi 22Na positron source was sandwiched
between two sheets of 100 µm thick plastic scintillator.

FIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the experimental setup.

The source-scintillator assembly was placed between two
pieces of 1 cm thick SiO2 aerogel, which was used as Ps
formation medium [10]. The macroscopic density and
the averaged grain diameter of the SiO2 aerogel are 0.1
g /cm3 and about 5 nm, respectively.

Most of the positrons from the source pass through the
scintillators and give scintillation lights. The lights pass
through the transparent SiO2 aerogel and are directed to
a photomultiplier tube(PMT) by a light guide. A γ-ray
emitted when a positron annihilates was detected by a
high purity Ge detector. The output of the Ge detector
was fed to a timing-ﬁlter-ampliﬁer(TFA). The time inter-
val between the anode signal of the PMT and the output
of the TFA was converted into an peak amplitude of an
output pulse by a time-to-amplitude converter(TAC) and
used for the lifetime spectroscopy. The other output of
the Ge detector was processed by a shaping ampliﬁer and
the peak hight was recorded for the energy information.
The observed energy region was limited in the neighbor-
hood of the 511 keV peak by a biased ampliﬁer. All the
data were stored in the list mode.

A 2 mm thick Pb sheet was placed in front of the Ge
detector to prevent low energy scattered γ-rays from si-
multaneously hitting the Ge detector.

The

time

resolution was 4.8 ns(FWHM), and
the energy resolution was 1.12 keV(FWHM) at 512
keV( 106Ru).

The chamber was ﬁlled with O2 of purity 99.9995%
to 1.05 atm after evacuating it with a turbo molecular
pump, and then isolated from the rest of the gas handling
system. The measurement lasted for 16 hours. During
the measurement, the room temperature was controlled

to be 25.5 ± 0.5◦C. For data analysis, a measurement
without a gas was also made for 16 hours.

FIG. 2: The time spectrum for the energy range from 500 keV
to 516 keV. The closed circles show the time interval distribu-
tion between a positron emission and the eventual annihila-
tion. The closed triangles show the ﬁttd λ as a function of the
start point of the ﬁt. The energy spectra of the 511keVγ-rays
in the time windows (a), (b), and (c) are shown in Fig. 4.

The closed circles in Fig. 2 show the positron lifetime
spectrum for the energy range from 500 keV to 516 keV.
The prompt peak is followed by the slow decay curve
and subsequently the ﬂat background. The prompt peak
arises from the positron annihilations without Ps forma-
tion as well as the self-annihilations of p-Ps. The slow
decay part originates from the o-Ps annihilations. The
total annihilation rate of the o-Ps, λoPs, is obtained from
the slow decay part. It is the sum of the self-annihilation
rate, λ3γ, and the annihilation rates for three diﬀerent
collisional quenching modes;

λoPs = λ3γ + λSiO2 + λox + λspin ,

(3)

where λSiO2 is the rate of the pickoﬀ quenching on the
grain surface, λox is that on the O2 molecule, and λspin
is the rate of the spin-conversion on the O2 molecule.

The latter two collisional quenching rates are propo-

tional to the number density of the O2 molecules, n,

λq = nσqvPs ,

(4)

where σq is the quenching cross-section and vPs is the
speed of the Ps. The speed of the o-Ps relative to the
target molecule has been replaced by vPs, neglecting the
relatively small velocity of the molecules.

The initial kinetic energy of the Ps depends on whether
it is formed inside a SiO2 grain or on a grain surface [11].
The Ps formed and thermalized inside a SiO2 grain es-
capes into the free space between the grains with the

kinetic energy of 1 eV determined by the negative work
function for the Ps. On the other hand, the Ps formed
on the surfaces of the grains is emmitted with the ki-
netic energy of 3 eV. It penetrates shallowly back into
another grain and thermalizes, and reemitted with the
kinetic energy of 1 eV.

Once the Ps energy reaches 1 eV, it does not enter
another grain any more. Then the energy loss of the Ps
becomes much slower [12, 13, 14]. This leads to the time
dependence of the collisional quenching rates, resulting
in time dependence of the total annihilation rate λoPs
and subtle and complicated shape of the o-Ps time spec-
trum. The time spectrum cannot be represented as a
simple exponential decay before the o-Ps is thermalized.
Denoting the survival probability of the o-Ps up to time
0 dt′λoPs(t′)), the time spectrum is

= N0[ǫ3γλ3γ + ǫ2γ(λSiO2 (t) + λox(t)

(5)

where ǫ3γ and ǫ2γ are the absolute detection eﬃciencies
for the γ-rays from the 3γ annihilations and the 2γ an-
nihilations, respectively, and N0 and C are constants.

In order to determine the total annihilation rate
λoPs for the themalized o-Ps, we ﬁt the lifetime spec-
trum(Fig. 2) to a function A exp(−λt) + B, where A
and B are constants, and the parameter λ is obtained as
the start time of the ﬁt t∗ is stepped out. The results are
plotted by triangles as a function of the start time of the
ﬁt in Fig.2. The ﬁtted λ gradually decreases, indicating
the o-Ps slowing down process, and then becomes ﬂat,
indicating that the o-Ps is thermalized. Once the o-Ps is
thermalized, the ﬁtted λ represents the total annihilation
rate of the o-Ps averaged over the Maxwell-Boltzmann
velocity distribution at the measuring temperature. The
λoPs for the thermalized o-Ps is determined from the
value in the region where the ﬁtted values are statisti-
cally consistent. We choose t∗ = 71ns to yield

FIG. 3: The energy spectrum of the annihilation γ-rays(closed
circles) for 1 atm of O2 with the time range from 71 ns to 150
ns. The background has been subtracted. The open circles
show the o-Ps self-annihilation component.

Figure 3 shows an example of the time-selected energy
spectrum for 1 atm of O2 measured by the AMOC. The
intensity and the shape of the background spectrum have
been estimated from the energy spectrum in the time
range from 400 ns to 700 ns and subtracted.

Figure 4 shows the Doppler broadening spectra in the
time ranges indicated. The spectra have been corrected
for the 3γ annihilation component, which is estimated
using theoretical 3γ spectrum convoluted with the energy
resolution curve, i.e., the shape of the 512 keV peak from
106Ru and normalized to the counts in the energy range
from 485 keV to 500 keV, as shown in Fig. 3.

The spectra in Fig.4 are ﬁtted to two gaussian func-
tions(solid curves). The dashed curves show the broad
component. The width of this component was ﬁxed to
that of the pickoﬀ component for SiO2 aerogel only, be-
cause the change in the width due to the presence of O2
molecules was not appreciable[8].

The spectra in Fig. 4(a) and (b) include the compo-
nents which contributes to the prompt peak; i.e., those
from the annihilations of the non-Ps positrons and p-
Ps. Hence they are not appropriate to the analysis. The
spectrum in Fig. 4(c) represents the 2γ annihilations of
the thermalized o-Ps. The pickoﬀ quenching gives the
extremely low intensity broad component representing
the momentum distribution of the electrons bound in O2
molecules and those on the SiO2 surfaces. The narrow
component results from the spin-conversion quenching
and represents the center-of-mass momentum distribu-
tion of the p-Ps at the moment of the annihilation after
the conversion from o-Ps. A log scale is used for the
vertical axis in Fig. 5 to blow up the pickoﬀ quenching
component.

the elastic spin-conversion cross-section of the thermal-

ing from the spin-conversion. The 1Zeﬀ for O2 is revealed
to be on the order of magnitude as the other gases.

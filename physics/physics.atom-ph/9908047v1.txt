Abstract

Theories unifying gravity and other interactions suggest the possibility of spa-
tial and temporal variation of physical “constants”. Accuracy achieved for
the atomic optical frequency standards (optical clocks) approaches the level
when possible time evolution of the ﬁne structure constant α can be studied
by comparisons of rates between clocks based on diﬀerent atomic transitions in
diﬀerent atoms. The sensitivity to variation of α is due to relativistic correc-
tions which are diﬀerent in diﬀerent atoms (∼ Z 2α2). We have calculated the
values of the relativistic energy shifts in In II, Tl II, Ba II and Ra II which all
can be used as atomic optical clocks. The results are to be used to translate
any change in the clock’s rate into variation of α.

Possible variations of the fundamental physical constants are suggested by uniﬁed theories,
such as string theory and M theory (see, e.g. [1–3]). A number of works have been done in last
few years in an attempt to ﬁnd an experimental evidence of any space-time variation of the
ﬁne structure constant α. The search goes mostly in two ways. One is based on the analysis of
the absorption spectra of distant quasars. Comparing the spectra of atoms or ions in distant
gas clouds which intersect the sight lines towards the quasars with the laboratory spectra
allows to put bounds on the space-time variation of α. Another way uses precise atomic
clocks in laboratory measurements. Diﬀerent atomic transitions depend diﬀerently on the ﬁne
structure constant. Comparing the rates of diﬀerent atomic clocks over long period of time
allows to put bounds on the local change of α with time. Astrophysical measurements have
a big advantage of having many-orders of magnitude enhancement factor gained by looking
into distant past. At present time the strongest bound on the possible space-time variation
of α has been obtained from the analysis of the quasar absorption spectra. There is even
an evidence that the value of α might be smaller in early epochs [4]. However, the accuracy
achieved for atomic clocks now approaches the level where the measurements with a similar
accuracy become possible. These measurements are also important because they produce
results which are independent of the cosmological model and any possible space variation of
the fundamental constants.

The strongest laboratory limit on the time variation of α was obtained by comparing
H-maser vs Hg II microwave atomic clocks over 140 days [5]. Fermi-Segre formula for the
hyperﬁne splitting was used to translate frequency drift into variation of α. This yielded an
upper limit ˙α/α ≤ 3.7 × 10−14/yr.

Another possibility is to use optical atomic frequency standards. These standards are
based on strongly forbidden E1-transitions or E2-transitions between the ground state of
an atom (ion) and its close metastable excited state. Proposed optical frequency standards
include Ca I [6], Sr II [7], Yb II [8], Hg II [9], Mg I [10], In II [11], Xe I [12], Ar I [13], etc.
In contrast with the microwave frequency standards, there is no simple analytical formula
for the dependence of optical atomic frequencies on α. This dependence can be revealed via
accurate relativistic calculations only. In our earlier paper [14] we presented such calculations
for Ca I, Sr II, Yb II and Hg II. We stress that relativistic corrections can not be reduced to
spin-orbit interaction. For example, the s-electron level has the largest relativistic correction
and no spin-orbit interaction [14].

Recently an experiment to measure possible time variation of α was proposed in Ref. [15]
by linking H and In II optical frequency standards. In present work we calculate relativistic
energy shift of the clock transition of In II and its heavier analogue Tl II. For the search
of variation of α Tl II may be preferable since it has bigger relativistic eﬀects (the relative
magnitude of the relativistic corrections increases as Z 2α2 with the nuclear charge Z). We
also include in the calculations some other metastable states of both ions. Ba II ion had
been considered as a candidate for the optical frequency standard in Ref. [16]. Therefore, we
perform the calculations for Ba II and its heavier analogue Ra II as well.

It is convenient to represent the results in the form

ω = ω0 + q1x + q2y,

αl )2 − 1, y = ( α

(1)
αl )4 − 1 and ω0 is an experimental frequency of a particular
where x = ( α
transition. To ﬁnd the value of the coeﬃcients q1 and q2 we have repeated the calculations
for α = α0, α = q7/8α0 and α = q3/4α0 and ﬁt the results by the formula (1). We started
the calculations from the relativistic Hartree-Fock method. V N −1 approximation was used to
generate a complete set of the core and valence basis states. Correlations between the core and
valence electrons have been included by means of the many-body perturbation theory. In the
case of In II and Tl II which both have two valence electrons above the closed-shell core the
correlations between the valence electrons have been included by means of the conﬁguration

interaction method. More detailed discussion of the method of calculations can be found in
our earlier work [14].

The obtained values of the coeﬃcients q1 and q2 as well as experimental frequencies of
some “clock” transitions in In II, Tl II, Ba II and Ra II are presented in Table I. Note that

˙ω |α=α0= (2q1 + 4q2)

The most recent and strongest limits on the time variation of α are

˙α/α < 3.7 × 10−14/yr Prestage et al [5],
−15/yr Damour and Dyson [17],
˙α/α < 10
˙α/α < 10−15/yr Webb at al [4],
˙α/α < 1.9 × 10−14/yr

Ivanchik et al [18].

Only ﬁrst of these results is a local present-day limit on the time variation of α. It was obtained
by comparing Hg II and H microwave atomic clocks as was mentioned before. Second result
was obtained from the analysis of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor. The Oklo event took
place in Gabon (Africa) around 1.8 × 109 years ago. Two other results came from the analysis
of the astrophysical data and correspond to even bigger time intervals. It is interesting to
see what accuracy is needed to improve the present-day limit on variation of α. Substituting
˙α/α = 10−14 and q1 and q2 from Table I into formula (2) we can get for the In II clock
transition

In II:

˙ω = 2.6 Hz/yr

( ˙α/α = 10−14yr−1).

(3)

Note, that the natural linewidth of the clock line of In II is 1.1 Hz [15]. The frequency of the
115In II clock transition is currently known to the accuracy ∼ 10−13:

ω0 = 1 267 402 452 914(42) kHz [15].

However, further two orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy is probably possible [19].
In fact , it is enough to measure variation of the ratio or diﬀerence between two frequencies.
Note, that relativistic energy shift of the 1S0−3P0 transition in Tl II is about 5 times bigger:

Tl II:

˙ω = 12 Hz/yr

( ˙α/α = 10−14yr−1).

(4)

Relativistic eﬀects are also big for upper metastable states of In II and Tl II and for the s − d
transitions in Ba II and Ra II (see Table I).
In principle, all these states can be used for
atomic clocks.

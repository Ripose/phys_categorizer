Abstract

The Faddeev equations for the atomic helium-trimer systems are solved

numerically with high accuracy both for the most sophisticated realistic po-

tentials available and for simple phenomenological potentials. An eﬃcient

numerical procedure is described. The large-distance asymptotic behavior,

crucial for weakly bound three-body systems, is described almost analyt-

ically for arbitrary potentials. The Eﬁmov eﬀect is especially considered.

The geometric structures of the bound states are quantitatively investi-

gated. The accuracy of the schematic models and previous computations

is comparable, i.e. within 20% for the spatially extended states and within

40% for the smaller 4He-trimer ground state.

1 Introduction

Weakly bound two- and three-body systems in low angular momentum states are
spatially very extended [1, 2, 3, 4]. We shall call them halos, if a substantial
fraction of the wave function is outside the range of the potentials. Each of
the constituent “particles” may be a composite system, provided it is a tightly
bound structure with a binding energy large compared to the interparticle binding
energy. Then the corresponding (intrinsic and halo) degrees of freedom decouple
and a few-body treatment is appropriate. Prominant examples are the new class
of nuclear states called nuclear halos [5, 6] and various molecular systems, in
particular the atomic helium trimer [8, 9].

Halo states are in general characterized by their large spatial extension. They
could as well appear as excited states of systems which in the ground state are of
a diﬀerent nature and spatially conﬁned. Borromean systems, where no binary
subsystem is bound, are particularly interesting three-body halo candidates [10].
They have by deﬁnition a relatively low binding energy. Many nuclear examples
are available [2, 5, 6] and until recently it was unclear whether the helium trimer
was of Borromean nature [8]. The halo concept is general and of interest in
diﬀerent subﬁelds of physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In the simplest case
of two-body halo systems universal relations between size and binding energy were
discussed [1, 13]. Also the general properties of three-body halos are intensively
discussed [2, 3, 4, 5, 14]

The halo structure is almost entirely determined by the tail properties of
the eﬀective interactions between the particles. If the ﬁnite-size particles have a
substantially overlap, the halo degrees of freedom do not decouple and the few-
body approximations are inaccurate [2, 14]. The eﬀective two-body interactions
should then reproduce low-energy scattering properties, i.e. phase shifts or it may
be suﬃcient with the correct scattering length and eﬀective range [2, 14, 15]. For
molecular systems it is possible to compute the two-body eﬀective potentials
directly from the electromagnetic interaction [8, 16].

The halo structure is technically diﬃcult to compute accurately, since precise
knowledge of the behavior of the eﬀective radial (three-body) potential at large-
distance is indispensable and at the same time the small distances, responsible
for the actual size of the binding energy, must also be properly included. Fortu-
nately, a method treating the large distances analytically and the short distances
numerically has recently become available [15, 17, 18, 19]. The method is very
powerful as demonstrated by the succesful investigation of the patological Eﬁ-
mov eﬀect [9, 17, 20]. Within the method the Faddeev equations are solved in
coordinate space in two steps. First the angular part is solved for each hyperra-
dius, thereby providing the adiabatic basis. This is usually the most diﬃcult part,
where semianalytic large-distance asymptotic solutions are employed. Afterwards
the coupled set of radial equations for the expansion coeﬃcients is solved.

Another somewhat similar method was recently used to study the helium

2

trimer [8]. This method exploit the fact that the interaction (in addition to two
distance-coordinates) only depends on one angle, since the three Euler angles
describe rotations of the system as a whole. In principle the same adiabatic basis
is then obtained. However, the computations only include the lowest angular
basis state which already seems to involve extensive calculations.

The 4He-dimer and trimer systems have recently been experimentally estab-
lished as weakly bound systems although without direct measurement of the
binding energies [21]. However, the size of the 4He-dimer was found to be exceed-
ingly large compared to the range of the two-body potential. In the conceptually
simple experiment transmission was measured through a screen consisting of holes
with radii comparable to the dimer size [22]. The binding energy of the dimer
must consequently be exceedingly small. However, this does not constrain the
binding energy of the three-body system which, due to the Thomas-eﬀect [23],
still can be much larger than the binding energy of the two-body system. On the
other hand, results from solving the Schr¨odinger equation as well as momentum
space Faddeev calculations strongly suggest that the trimer binding energy in-
deed is very small [8, 24]. Both computations conclude that the trimer has two
bound states of which the excited state has the characteristica of an Eﬁmov state:
When the attraction is increased it disappears into the continuum away from the
discrete three-body spectrum.

Interesting systems can be formed by substituting one or more of the 4He-
atoms by 3He-atoms. The electron structure is identical and the eﬀective two-
body interaction is then unchanged. Due to the smaller masses the three-body
states move up in energy and calculations predict that 4He3He2 and the 3He-
trimer both are unbound [8]. There is no simple relation between the size and
the binding energy of these systems and detailed calculations of the three-body
wave functions are needed.

The purpose of the present paper is three-fold. First, we shall repete the in-
vestigation of Esry et al. [8] and extent it to include suﬃciently many adiabatic
basis states to obtain precise solutions. We shall keep an eye on the possible
occurrence of Eﬁmov states. Second, we shall deﬁne simple two-body potentials
reproducing the low-energy scattering behavior of the realistic potentials. We
shall assess the accuracy of such approximation schemes, which reduce the nec-
essary computational eﬀorts by orders of magnitude. Third, we shall describe an
improved method able to deal eﬃciently with large repulsive cores as traditionally
used in the parametrization of the two-body molecular interaction.

After the introduction we describe ﬁrst brieﬂy in section 2 the general method
of solving the Faddeev equations using hyperspherical coordinates. The angular
equations and the eﬀective radial potential at large distances are then analyzed in
sections 3 and 4. The rather delicate numerical procedure and the corresponding
results are discussed in sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally section 7 contains
the summary and the conclusions.

2 Theoretical method

We shall consider an angular momentum zero system of three interacting inert
“particles”, where the k’th particle has mass mk and coordinate rk. Their intrinsic
degrees of freedom are frozen and only the three-body degrees of freedom shall
be treated here. The two-body interactions between the particles i and j are Vij.
We shall use the three sets of Jacobi coordinates xi and yi and the corresponding
three sets of hyperspherical coordinates (ρ, Ωi)=(ρ, αi, Ωxi, Ωyi) deﬁned by [2, 10]

3 Large-distance angular solution

The angular functions Φ(i)
n (ρ, Ωi) are expanded in products of the three-body
spherical harmonics Yℓxmx(Ωxi) and Yℓymy (Ωyi) where the orbital angular mo-
menta and their projections associated with x and y are (ℓx, mx) and (ℓy, my).
The total angular momentum is zero and we get

the non-zero ℓ -contributions of the two other Faddeev components. A detailed
analysis shows that R(i)
ℓ (αi) is proportional to sinℓ+1 αi.

ℓ

When ρ is large the potential is zero everywhere except for small αi. Thus
for ℓ > 0 the eﬀect of the potential on the left hand side of the equation have to
been seen through a centrifugal barrier proportional to ℓ(ℓ + 1) and the eﬀect of
the potential on the right hand side is quenched by a factor of α1+ℓ

.

i

Thus for non-zero ℓ all terms containing the potential can be put to zero
for large enough ρ. Thus the free equation appear. So if any of the Faddeev
components have a ﬁnite contribution with ℓ > 0 for ρ
we obtain the free

solution for that component with the free eigenvalue ν2
n = (K + 2)2 where K is
an even integer equal or greater than 2ℓ. Again a detailed analyses shows that

The eigenvalue solutions ν2
n to eqs.(17), (20) and (24) converge towards the hyper-
spherical spectrum as ρ increases. Due to the coupling the asymptotic values are
now approached over a distance deﬁned by the scattering lengths, which might
be very much larger than the ranges of the interactions.

The potentials ρ2vi(ρ sin αi) vanish for large ρ for all αi except in a narrow
region around zero. The conditions for the eﬀective range approximation therefore

7

become better and better fulﬁlled as ρ increases and any potential with the same
scattering length and eﬀective range would lead to the same results. Let us then
S(i)
in the region of large ρ use square well potentials Vjk(r) =
0 Θ(r < Ri), or
s(i)
equivalently expressed by the reduced quantities vi(x) =
0 Θ(x < Xi = Riµjk),
where the parameters are adjusted to reproduce the two-body scattering lengths
and eﬀective ranges of the initial potential. The corresponding solutions are then
accurate approximations to our original problem at distances comparable to the
range of the potentials [19].

−

−

Using square well potentials we can now easily deﬁne the constants α(i)
0 =
arcsin(Xi/ρ) such that the potentials vi(ρ sin αi) for large ρ are zero in region II
where αi > α(i)
0 and ﬁnite and constant in region I where αi < α(i)
1. The
square well solutions are then given in eqs.(19), (21) and (23). We can also solve
the approximate equation in eq.(24) for both region I and II. We obtain again
the same solutions, where ν2(ρ) is neglected compared to ρ2vi(0) and sin(ναi) in
the last term of eq.(21) should be replaced by ναi. Matching these solutions at
the boundary αi = α(i)
0 provides the quantization condition and determines the
eigenvalue ν.

0 ≪

Also the decoupled equations in eq.(16) for non-zero ℓ-values can be solved
for square well potentials. In region I and II the solutions are proportional to the
spherical Bessel functions and the hyperspherical polynomials, respectively.

All these square well solutions coincide at large distances with the solutions
for any general potential with the same scattering length and eﬀective range.
However, when the two-body potentials are strongly repulsive at small distances it
is an advantage to use eq.(20) with the correct potential instead of both the square
well solution and the additional approximation in eq.(24). A faster convergence
(for smaller ρ) towards the large-distance asymptotics is then obtained.

The method described here is useful when the large-distance behavior is im-
portant. In extreme cases as for example for Eﬁmov states and halo systems the
large distances are necessary and otherwise diﬃcult or impossible to compute
suﬃciently accurate. For large distances, where the approximations become in-
creasingly better, it is in any case much easier to obtain accurate solutions from
the asymptotic equations than from the original integro-diﬀerential equations in
eq.(17). Thus we have formulated a convenient numerical procedure.

4 The eﬀective potential and the Eﬁmov states

The most important ingredient in the radial equation is the angular eigenvalue
λ = ν2
4. We can extract the essential properties by analytical analysis of a
schematic model. For simplicity we consider three identical bosons. We ﬁrst ﬁnd
S0Θ(r < R0) with the same scattering length as and
the square well potential

ρ larger than 2R0. The large-distance behavior is essentially determined by the
s-waves. The resulting eigenvalue equation, derived from eqs.(19), (21) and (23),
is a simple transcendental equation [19]

The eﬀective radial potential is in this way obtained analytically for the square
well potential for various distance intervals when the scattering length is large
compared to the interaction range. However, as indicated above these results
are more general, since they can be expressed in terms of scattering length and
eﬀective range, which are universal quantities characterizing low-energy two-body
scattering properties of short-range potentials. For distances smaller than R0 the
details of the original two-body potentials are essential and the square well results
are not applicable. This part of the potential is decisive for the actual (small)
binding energy of the three-body system.

Clearly inﬁnitely large as then gives inﬁnitely many bound Eﬁmov states. They
are extremly weakly bound and extremely spatially extended.

Eﬁmov states may also be present in non-identical bosonic three-body sys-
tems. The condition is that at least two of the binary subsystems have bound
s-states at zero energy or equivalently inﬁnitely large scattering lengths. The
third binary subsystem must be without bound states. A ﬁnite number of states
with similar properties appear when the conditions are approximately fulﬁlled.
The appearance is determined by the large-distance behavior of the zero angular
momentum states.

5 Numerical procedure

It should be straightforward to solve the equations of motion numerically. How-
ever, two major diﬃculties must be tackled. The ﬁrst is related to the large
short-range repulsive core where the wave function must be extremely small.
The potential has an attractive pocket at short distances where the wave func-
tion also is small. These inner regions are where the potential is relatively large,
are decisive for the energy of the bound states and the corresponding wave func-
tion must therefore be calculated with high accuracy. The second problem is that
the weakly bound states are located far outside the range of the potential and
the appropriate long-range part of both the potential and the wave function are
therefore also decisive. A marginal numerical inaccuracy could be crucial for the
number of loosely bound states.

5.1 Method

Our ﬁrst overall computing strategy is to use the Faddeev decomposition of the
Schr¨odinger equation. The proper boundary conditions and the more subtle
correlations are then much easier to account for in actual computations. The
second computing strategy is to expand on a suitable angular basis for short
distances and solve the large-distance asymptotic angular equations directly at
In an overlapping region these solutions are then combined.
large distances.
Finally the coupled set of radial equations is solved.

For short distances each Faddeev component is then expanded on the hyper-
spherical basis [12, 10, 2]. This amounts for each ρ to an expansion in eq.(15)
of the functions φ(i) in Jacobi polynomials. The remaining expansion coeﬃcients
are functions of ρ. The total angular basis then consists of a carefully selected set
of hyperspherical harmonics with the total angular momentum zero. The basis
is characterized by the Faddeev components i = 1, 2, 3, the quantum numbers
ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3... and the hyperspherical quantum number K = 0, 2, 4, 6....

Only basis functions with the correct symmetry properties are included, i.e.
symmetric or antisymmetric for bosons or fermions. When ρ2vi is small for small
ρ the angular eigenvalue equation eq.(8) only includes the kinetic energy operator
with the corresponding hyperspherical harmonics as solutions. In this case a few
of the lowest ℓ and K quantum numbers are suﬃcient in the basis.

For a repulsive core, where ρ2vi diverges (or simply is very large), larger ℓ-
values are needed in the basis to produce a vanishing wave function at small
distances. The angular matrix elements of the potentials become large for small
ρ even for high ℓ, where the contribution usually vanishes due to the centrifugal
barrier. A faster convergence in ℓ is achieved by subtracting a constant V0 from
each of the two-body potentials and subsequently correcting the energy eigenvalue
by 3V0. This is simply a shift of the energy scale by 3V0. If the inﬁnite basis is

11

used the choice of constant makes no diﬀerence. A minimal basis size is obtained
when V0 approximately equals the lowest angular eigenvalue.

Increasing ρ normally decreases the required maximum ℓ-value since the cen-
trifugal barrier then increases. On the other hand larger hyperspherical quantum
numbers (or polynomial orders) are needed, because for short-range interactions
the potentials in α-space become increasingly conﬁned to a narrow region of phase
space around αi = 0. Accurate wave functions in this decreasing region around
αi = 0 require high-order Jacoby polynomials (high K) to reproduce the rapid
change caused by the corresponding behavior of the potential.

In the limit of very large ρ the hyperspherical spectrum is also approached for
short-range potentials. Therefore in this extreme limit only small ℓ and small K
are needed to obtain the angular eigenvalue spectrum. However, in the sometimes
very extended transition region of intermediate ρ-values the eigenvalues are re-
quired with high precision. Thus, increasing ρ demands an increasing basis for an
accurate description. It is crucial that this basis only needs to include high-order
polynomials, but still only small angular momenta. The necessary basis can then
be substantially reduced from the full hyperspherical basis with all K and ℓ due
to the use of the Faddeev equations instead of the Schr¨odinger equation.

We shall treat large ρ by considering s-waves, ℓ = 0, without the further
expansion on the Jacobi-polynomia, i.e. we shall solve the large-distance equa-
tions (20) directly. Moving towards smaller ρ we must then ﬁnd an overlap
region where the large- and small-distance solutions coincide. To optimize com-
putational speed and accuracy the basis must therefore be carefully selected to
provide suﬃcient accuracy in the overlap region.
When the asymptotic states correspond to ℓ

= 0 the convergence is expected
to be much faster and essentially reached already at small distance. We extrap-
2 where c is a constant
olate the λ-values by using the form K(K + 4) + cρ−
obtained by matching and K is the asymptotic hyperspherical quantum number
of this eigenvalue.

The direct way of calculating the coupling terms Pnn′ and Qnn′ is to perform
a numerical derivation, but this numerical double derivative is inaccurate in re-
gions where the wave functions change rapidly, i.e.
for repulsive cores at small
distances. Instead we used the explicit expressions in eq.(12) for small distances.
For large distances we used numerical derivation for the Pnn′ and Qnn and a
smooth extrapolation of the small distance functions for the non-diagonal Qnn′.

5.2 Parameters

In the actual cases of the He-trimer systems we choose the mass unit m in eq.(5)
in the deﬁnition of the Jacobian coordinates [2, 10, 12] to be one nuclear mass
unit m = 1822.887 a.u. (atomic mass unit). The masses of the He-atoms are
then m(4He) = 4.002603250m and m(3He) = 3.016026m.

The two-body interaction is the LM2M2 potential from [26]. The three-body
interaction V3 is very small [31] and assumed to be zero in the present computa-
tion. For the 4He-trimer the eﬀective range of the potential is Ref f = 13.843 a.u.
(1 atomic length units = 0.529177 ˚A) and the binding energy is estimated to be
6 atomic
of the order of 1mK [8, 22] (1 Kelvin = 0.0861735 meV = 3.16679
energy units). This extremely low binding energy is equivalent to a two-body
189.054 a.u., which is much larger than the eﬀective
scattering length of as =

For the 4He-trimer we used a basis set of 150, 40 Jacobi polynomials for each
Faddeev component for ℓ = 0, 2, respectively and 30 for ℓ = 4, 6, 8. This amounts
to 840 basis states in total, but after projecting on the states with correct
symmetry the basis size was reduced to 235. For the 3He4He2 and 4He3He2-
molecules we used a basis set of 150, 60, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25 Jacobi polynomials
for each Faddeev component for ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively and 20 for
ℓ = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The components related to two identical 4He or 3He-
atoms only needs even ℓ due to the symmetry requirement. For the asymmetric
trimers this amounts to a total basis of 1500 which reduced to 638 after symme-
try restoration. In all cases this corresponds to an overlap region between small
and large distances around ρ = 100 a.u. The converged results from the basis
diagonalization and the asymptotic solutions are then used below and above 100
a.u., respectively.

The convergence and the accuracy of the numerical results were tested thor-
oughly by varying the number of Jacobi polynomials in each component as well
as the number of partial waves. The results are also independent of relatively
small variations of the position of the matching point between the small and large
distance solutions. Thus we expect reliable numerical results.

6 Numerical results

The numerical procedure and the input parameters are now speciﬁed. The results
are obtained by expansion on the adiabatic basis and we shall therefore ﬁrst
compute the corresponding angular eigenvalues. Then we shall show energies and
wave functions for both the LM2M2 and the simple schematic potentials. Finally
we discuss the various intrinsic geometric structures with special emphasis on the
possible appearence of Eﬁmov states.

6.1 Angular eigenvalues

The decisive quantities are the adiabatic potentials where the main components
are the angular eigenvalues. The lowest of these are computed and shown in ﬁg. 1
s functions of ρ for the 4He-trimer. Both the general small-distance numerical
solutions and the asymptotic large-distance s-wave solutions are shown. They
diverge for small ρ due to the strongly repulsive core in the interaction between
two He-atoms. The lowest of these eigenvalues has an attractive pocket at small
for large ρ. The pocket is re-
distance and diverges parabolically towards
sponsible for the three-body bound states and the divergence reﬂects the bound
state in the two-body subsystem. Due to the very small two-body binding en-
ergy the lowest level remains almost constant up to about 1000 a.u. where the
divergence sets in. The overlap region above which the asymptotic solutions can
be used is seen to be around 100 a.u.

−∞

The higher lying eigenvalues asymptotically approach the hyperspherical spec-
trum deﬁned by K(K + 4) where K is a non-negative integer. In the present case
K must furthermore be an even number because the total orbital angular mo-
mentum is zero. The requirement of totally symmetric wave functions removes
a number of otherwise possible degenerate states. This eliminates completely all
K = 2 states whereas the asymptotic states corresponding to K = 0, 4, 6, 8, 10 all
are non-degenerate and with the angular quantum number ℓ = 0. For K = 12 the
s-wave solution is accompanied by a higher angular momentum solution, which
has converged to the asymptotic value 12(12+4)=192 already at about ρ = 100
a.u. This level and that of K = 10 avoided crossing at about ρ = 80 a.u. The
even higher lying levels are also degenerate corresponding to more than one to-
tally symmetric state.

The angular eigenvalue spectrum changes when the asymmetric 3He4He2-
molecule is considered, see ﬁg. 2. The interactions are the same as for the
symmetric case but the masses are diﬀerent. The number of levels is roughly
increased by a factor of two due to the less restrictive symmetry requirement.
The divergence for ρ = 0, the parabolic divergence at large ρ due to the two-
body bound state and the convergence to the hyperspherical spectrum at large
distances are still the dominating features. Compared to the 4He-system we now
ﬁnd a number of additional levels. They correspond to nearly antisymmetric so-
lutions in the exchange of 3He and 4He whereas the “original” levels also present
for the 4He-trimer must be of symmetric character.

Considering the 4He3He2-molecule obtained by substituting another 4He by a
3He-atom again decreases all the binding energies. We show the angular eigen-
value spectrum in ﬁg. 3, where the usual features are seen. However, now the
lowest eigenvalue converges to zero for large ρ, since none of the two-body sub-
systems form bound states. The asymptotic spectrum is now reached much faster
than for the two previous cases. This rate of convergence is roughly proportional
to the sum of the three scattering lengths or more precisely 16

6.2 Energies and wave functions

For halo states the decisive properties of the potentials are related to the low-
energy scattering behavior or equivalently to the large distance behavior. This
is formally expressed in the eﬀective range theory where disparate potentials

The lowest and decisive eigenvalue for these potentials is plotted in ﬁg. 4 as
function of ρ. The eigenvalues for all the three simple potentials coincide for
ρ > 40 a.u. whereas that of LM2M2 lies slightly below and slowly approaching
the others as ρ increases. The deviations are enhanced due to the focus on
one λ-value and the restriction to distances less than 200 a.u. The diﬀerences
can only be interpreted as eﬀects of terms of higher order than in the eﬀective
range expansion. They are not completely negligible in this region because of
the large repulsive core of the LM2M2-potential. At smaller distances the simple
potentials produce eigenvalues approaching zero for ρ = 0. This behavior is then
compensated by less attraction in the pocket region.

The binding energies are obtained by solving the coupled set of radial equa-
tions. The lower and upper limits can be found by using only the lowest adiabatic
potential with and without the diagonal term Q11, see [30]. These limits were
computed in [8]. We repete this computation using our method and we further-
more increase the number of adiabatic potentials until the results have converged.
For the 4He-trimer we also ﬁnd one excited state in agreement with the discussion
in connection with eq.(35). One additional oscillation would extend beyond 10
times the scattering length and a third excited state is therefore not possible even

We compare in table 2 binding energies for the LM2M2 and the simple inter-
actions for both the ground state and the excited state of the 4He-trimer. We
conﬁrm the limits computed in [8]. The lowest 7 to 8 adiabatic potentials are
needed to obtain the accurate energies deviating from the upper limit by about
20% and 7% for the ground and excited states, respectively. This relatively slow
convergence for the LM2M2 potential is due to the large repulsive core. Less adi-
abatic potentials are needed for convergence for the simple two-body interactions,
where the lower and upper limits in any case are very close and a larger basis
therefore also for this reason is less needed. The binding energies for the gaussian
potential are about 20% and 10% higher than for the LM2M2 interaction for the
ground state and the excited state, respectively. The corresponding numbers for
the exponential potential are 40% and 20%.

The large-distance tails of gaussian and exponential two-body potentials are
very diﬀerent and the variations established here therefore measure the uncer-
tainties inherent in such estimates. These results strongly indicate that such
weakly bound states can be studied by simple but carefully chosen potentials
provided an accuracy of less than about 40% and 20% are required for states lo-
cated respectively at the edge and far outside the short-range potential. Further
accuracy can be obtained with an appropriate choice of radial shape of the simple
two-body potential. The computations simplify due to the lack of repulsion at
small distances and the smaller basis required.

Substituting one of the 4He-atoms in the 4He-trimer by a 3He-atom decreases
the binding energies and only the ground state remains bound. We compare in
table 3 the results for diﬀerent potentials. Unlike the symmetric case we now
obtain slightly less binding energy than in [8]. The diﬀerence is less than 0.1%
compared to the strengths of the potentials but about 5% compared to the binding
energy itself. Our convergence was thoroughly tested again, but we were not able
to ﬁnd the origin of the discrepancy. As for the symmetric system an accurate
binding energy requires 5 to 6 adiabatic potentials for the LM2M2 interaction
and again about 40% is gained compared to the upper limit obtained by using
only the lowest adiabatic potential. The simple potentials are now oﬀ by factors
1.4 and 1.8 for gaussian and exponential radial shapes, respectively.

The radial wave function has a distribution of components corresponding to
the diﬀerent adiabatic potentials, see eq.(7). The lowest is by far carrying the
largest probability as seen in tables 4 and 5 for the two He-trimer systems. The
exceedingly small occupation probability for the higher lying angular eigenvalues

seems oﬀ hand to contradict the relatively large contribution to the binding en-
ergies. The rather instructive explanation for weakly bound systems is that the
variation in binding energy might appear to be large when compared to the bind-
ing energy itself, but insigniﬁcant compared to the strength of the interactions
responsible for the binding, see ﬁg. 4 where the potential depths are around 2
K compared to the binding energies of mK. Thus the lowest adiabatic potentials
give a good approximation for the wave functions although the corresponding
binding energies only are obtained with less relative accuracy.

The dominating components of the radial wave functions for the ground state
and excited state of the 4He-trimer are shown in ﬁg. 5 along with the diﬀerent
eﬀective radial potentials. The repulsive core pushes the ground state towards
larger distances, whereas the simple potentials allow ﬁnite probability also at
small distances. The excited state is already at a large distance and therefore less
aﬀected by the changing potentials. The wave functions related to the diﬀerent
potentials are quite similar. The length of the ﬁrst oscillation is about the 350
a.u. as predicted from eq.(34) with Ref f = 18 a.u. The next would extend 20
times as far, i.e. about 7000 a.u.

6.3 Geometric structure

The wave functions in ﬁg. 5 are clearly not revealing directly the geometric struc-
ture of these three-body systems. This is not only because the angular part of the

wave function is missing, but also because the plotted total wave function fully
includes all the appropriate symmetries, i.e. symmetric in exchanges of identical
bosons and rotational symmetry averaging over all directions. To get a visual
picture of the structure we want to consider the plane through the three particles
at points ri. The center of mass is at the origin. Let us take the y-axis as the
principle axis with the lowest moment of inertia. We furthermore assume that
one particle is in the ﬁrst and two particles are in the third and fourth quadrants.
This leaves us with the intrinsic geometry of the trimer.

The resulting contour plots are shown in ﬁg. 6. Note that the distance scales
on the individual ﬁgures are quite diﬀerent. The triangular shape for the 4He-
trimer ground state (left) is quite apparent. The excited state in the middle show
that two of the particles prefer to be close while the third particle is further away.
The Eﬁmov conditions are almost fulﬁlled, i.e. very large scattering lengths for at
least two of the binary subsystems. As we shall discuss later this ﬁgure illustrates
the structure of an Eﬁmov state. Any higher-lying Eﬁmov state could simply be
found by a scaling of the axes, see eq.(31).

The contour diagram at the right side of ﬁg. 6 also show the preference for
two relatively close-lying particles. However, only one scattering length is now
large and the Eﬁmov conditions are not fulﬁlled. It is instructive to imagine that
the 3He-4He scattering length is increased and the subsequent appearence of the

.

Eﬁmov states. The lowest eigenvalue in ﬁg. 2 would still bend over and diverge
due to the bound state. The second eigenvalue would approach a negative con-
stant above the lowest eigenvalue. The corresponding adiabatic potential would
isolated provide the Eﬁmov states. However, these states would appear in the
continuum as excited states above the ground state shown in the ﬁgure. Thus the
ground state of the asymmetric system cannot be an approximate Eﬁmov state.
The superﬁcial resemblance of the middle and right ﬁgures therefore illustrates
how deceiving the density distribution can be. Additional information is needed
to come up with the correct interpretation.

For the asymmetric system we can also compute the individual particle den-
sity as shown in ﬁg. 7. The left ﬁgure can be obtained from the right ﬁgure if
a small component with an elongated distribution is added. The 4He-trimer ap-
pears in a completely symmetric state while the asymmetric system in addition
also has a relatively small asymmetric component of the 3He-4He relative wave
function. The large symmetric component resembles the 4He-trimer and the small
asymmetric conﬁguration, which becomes dominating at larger distances where
the structure of the 4He-dimer is approached.

The triangular structure at the left side of ﬁg. 6 is apart from the scale similar
to the three-body cluster approximation of the ground state of 12C, whereas the

26

two other trimer states are very diﬀerent from the almost linear conﬁguration of
the astrophysically interesting ﬁrst excited 0+-state of 12C, which therefore is far
from being an Eﬁmov state, see [27].

The geometry of the He-trimers can be studied quantitatively by computation
of various expectation values related to the distances between the particles. We
ﬁrst consider the sizes shown in table 6 where two measures are used, i.e. the
root mean square radius and the (ﬁrst order) distance from the center of mass.
The dimer has an average distance between the particles of about 100 a.u., which
20 a.u. [22]. The
is at the lower end of the experimentally allowed range of 120
three-body ground state is much smaller than the 4He-dimer [8, 22]. However,
the size of about 100 a.u. of the excited state is around 50% larger than for the
dimer both when measured by the ﬁrst and the second moment. This radius is
larger than the range of the eﬀective two-body interaction but smaller than the
size (189 a.u.) of the scattering length. The spatial extension of the probability

the range of the eﬀective radial three-body potential (ρ−

state.

The ratio between the three-body radii of excited and ground state is 9.5 which
only is two times smaller than the asymptotic prediction from eq.(34). In com-
parison the ratio of the binding energies is 52 which is about 7 times smaller than
predicted in eq.(36) for two Eﬁmov states. These observations simply conﬁrm
that the ground state does not have the characteristics of an Eﬁmov state. An
additional (second) excited state (which is impossible for this scattering length)
would have obeyed these scaling laws for radii and energies for Eﬁmov states.

The asymmetric system 3He4He2 has only one bound state with both binding
energy and size in between the corresponding values for the ground state and the
excited state of the symmetric system, see tables 2, 3 and 6. For Eﬁmov states
the product of the energy and the square of the radius should be a constant, see
eqs.(34) and (36). This product is four times larger for the excited symmetric
state than for the asymmetric state. The radius should then be about twice as
large if the state should resemble an Eﬁmov state. However, this seems to be
unlikely, since the radius is of the same order as the two-body eﬀective ranges. In
any case the interpretation as an approximate Eﬁmov state was already excluded
in the discussion above. Thus a pronounced halo structure is therefore a more
appropriate description.

The distance between the two 4He-particles computed as

is 28 a.u.
and the distance between 3He and one speciﬁc of the 4He-particles is 38 a.u. The
distances between both the 3He-4He and the two 4He particles are then two to
three times smaller in this asymmetric bound state than in the bound 4He dimer.
As necessary both distances are in between the minimum and maximum of 20 and
46 a.u. Again this demonstrates that the bound dimer-state is not a dominating
conﬁguration in the three-body systems.

Another interesting quantity in table 6 is the expectation value of the ratio
between the smallest and the largest interparticle distance. First the minimum
and maximum average distances themselves diﬀer by a factor of two for the
ground states and a factor of three for the excited Eﬁmov-like state. The ratio
is nearly 0.5 for both ground states and 0.34 for the excited state. If the angular
part (including the α coordinate) of the wave function was constant this number
would be 0.52.
In the case of an Eﬁmov state this number was computed to
be 0.38. Thus the excited state does also in this respect resemble an Eﬁmov
state. That the ratio is less than the value for an Eﬁmov state indicates non-
negligible contributions corresponding to two particles in a bound state and the
third particle further away. This is consistent with the observation that the
excited stated is larger than the dimer.

In all cases the simple potentials produce sizes deviating about 10% and 20%
for gaussian and exponential potentials from those of the LM2M2 interaction.
Thus if only this accuracy is required the corresponding simpler computations
are suﬃcient.

7 Summary and conclusions

Spatially extended three-body halo states are apparently present in some of the
atomic helium-trimer systems. The 4He-dimer is experimentally established as
exceedingly large and as a consequence it must also be very loosely bound. The
large distances are then essential in any accurate description. The possibility of
ﬁnding Eﬁmov states is adding interest in obtaining a quantitative understanding,
but unfortunately at the same time emphasizing the practical diﬃculties. The
necessary large-distance correlations must be treated very accurately without
loosing the precision at smaller distances where the binding energy originates.
This three-body problem is of quantum mechanical nature since the probability
almost entirely is found in the classically forbidden region.

We incorporate the correlations by solving the coordinate space Faddeev equa-
tions. We expand the wave function in a complete set of angular eigenfunctions
obtained by solving the angular part of the Faddeev equations for a given hy-
perradius. This adiabatic basis is related to a set of eﬀective radial potentials.
The corresponding radial wave functions are solutions to the coupled set of radial
diﬀerential equations. We ﬁrst formulate this prescription in general and then
the crucial large distances are speciﬁcally considered. Only s-waves couple at
large distances and this fact is exploited to derive simple equations with almost
analytic solutions. A suitable numerical procedure follows from this formulation.
For exploratory calculations we furthermore suggest a simplifying approximation
where the “correct” potential is substituted by almost schematic potentials with
relatively little loss of accuracy for the spatially extended states.

29

The lowest eﬀective radial potential is decisive and we describe a series of its
large-distance analytic properties for a symmetric system. When the two-body
scattering length is suﬃciently large the Eﬁmov states appear as solutions. We
repete the occurrence conditions and a few of the analytic properties of these
exotic states.

The strongly repulsive core is necessary in a correct description of the two-
body potential. The numerical procedure is somewhat delicate and a sizable basis
is necessary. Each of the Faddeev components is expanded on the hyperspherical
basis. We need relative angular momentum quantum numbers up to about 10,
Jacobi polynomials for s-waves up to order 150 and signiﬁcantly fewer for the
higher partial waves. This numerical procedure produces the solutions at small
distances up to about 100 a.u. and from then on we use the solutions obtained
directly from the decoupled large-distance set of equations.

The schematic two-body potentials are parametrized to reproduce the scatter-
ing length and eﬀective range of the original complicated potential. We use radial
shapes of gaussian, exponential and square well form. The solutions are much
easier to compute due to the lack of hard core repulsion. Still these simple at-
tractive potentials reproduce the results of the “correct” calculations within 40%
and signiﬁcantly better for the spatially extended states. More suited shapes
could certainly reduce this uncertainty, which in fact is remarkable for several
reasons. First this demonstrates the importance of the large-distance behavior of
the eﬀective radial potential. Second the error in binding energy by using such
simple potentials is roughly the same as the results obtained by using only the
lowest adiabatic potential, which carries more than 99% of the probability in a
fully converged calculation. Thus simple potentials could be exploited to gain
even semi quantitative insight.

We have essentially conﬁrmed the calculations of [8] using the lowest adia-
batic potential. In our full calculations we ﬁnd additional binding of 7% to 40%
measured relative to the binding energy, which is several orders of magnitude
smaller than the strength of the attraction. Indeed these states are very weakly
bound. We investigated the geometry of the bound He-trimer states. The ground
state of 4He3 is an equal sided triangle. The excited state of 4He3 and the ground
state of the asymmetric 3He4He2 system are both also triangular but with sides
diﬀering by a factor of two to three.

The excited state of 4He3 has all the characteristics of an Eﬁmov state whereas
the somewhat similar density distribution of the asymmetric state rather should
be characterized as a pronounced halo state. More Eﬁmov states would only
appear in the symmetric system when the scattering length is increased by about
one order of magnitude. Smaller changes would be needed to promote the halo
state to the giant halo state called an Eﬁmov state.

In conclusion, we have described a method to compute spatially extended
three-body structures. The essential large-distance behavior is specially treated.
We apply the method to the atomic helium trimers. The binding energies are

30

accurately determined and the geometric structures are found to be triangular
conﬁgurations. The ground state of 4He3 has a triangular shape and the excited
state is an Eﬁmov state whereas the 3He4He2 bound state is a halo state.

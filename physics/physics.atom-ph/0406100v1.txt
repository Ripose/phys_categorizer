The translational motion of molecular ions can be eﬀectively cooled sympathetically to trans-
lational temperatures below 100 mK in ion traps through Coulomb interactions with laser-cooled
atomic ions. The ro-vibrational degrees of freedom, however, are expected to be largely unaﬀected
during translational cooling. We have previously proposed schemes for cooling of the internal de-
grees of freedom of such translationally cold but internally hot heteronuclear diatomic ions in the
simplest case of 1Σ electronic ground state molecules. Here we present a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation
of these schemes and make a generalization to the most frequently encountered electronic ground
states of heteronuclear molecular ions: 1Σ , 2Σ , 3Σ and 2Π . The schemes are relying on one or
two laser driven transitions with the possible inclusion of a tailored incoherent far infrared radiation
ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The cooling and manipulation of neutral molecules has
become the subject of intense studies in recent years
and impressive advances have been made. Experiments
include the successful production of molecular Bose-
Einstein condensates [1, 2, 3], the deceleration and trap-
ping of polar molecules in inhomogeneous ﬁelds [4, 5, 6, 7]
and loading a trap with paramagnetic molecules cooled
by a He buﬀer gas [8, 9]. For the NH radical the
presence of an unusually large Franck-Condon factor of-
fers prospects for direct Doppler cooling of a trapped
molecule [10].

Molecular ions constitute another class of molecules
that are very interesting to cool and manipulate. Di-
atomic molecular ions are, e.g., important constituents
of interstellar media [11, 12], comets and cool stellar at-
mospheres including that of the sun [12, 13], and there
have recently been proposals to utilize cold molecules to
implement a quantum computer [14, 15].

The cooling of molecules is in general more complicated
than that of atoms since the ro-vibrational substructure
of the electronic molecular energy levels normally makes
it impossible to ﬁnd a closed optical pumping scheme to
be used for conventional laser cooling. Molecular ions,
however, may be very eﬀectively cooled sympathetically
by loading them into a trap with laser cooled atomic ions
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The Coulomb interaction between the
charged particles provides eﬃcient momentum transfer
from the initially hot molecular ions to the cooled atomic
ions. Dissipative cooling of the translational motion is
hence obtained for both species although only the atomic
ions are subject to laser cooling.

One might expect that the ro-vibrational degrees of
freedom of a diatomic molecule placed in the vicinity of a
cooled atomic ion would couple to the translational mo-
tion of the atomic ion, resulting in strong sympathetic

cooling of these degrees of freedom. In a typical ion trap,
however, the excitation energy of the translational atomic
motion in the trap (vibrations in the harmonic trap po-
tential) is of the order of 1 MHz, which is much smaller
than typical energies of ro-vibrational excitations (of the
order 1011 − 1014 Hz). The large diﬀerence between these
numbers prohibits that the internal ro-vibrational states
couple eﬀectively to the external motion of the ions in
the trap. In the following we therefore assume that the
internal degrees of freedom relax to equilibrium with the
black-body radiation (BBR) present in the trap. This
will happen on a timescale of tens of seconds, which is
signiﬁcantly faster than the inelastic collision time in the
trap which, from Langevin theory, is estimated to be hun-
dreds of seconds [21].

In Refs. [21, 22] we proposed schemes for cooling of
the rotational degree of freedom of such molecular ions in
the case of heteronuclear molecules with a 1Σ electronic
ground state. The schemes are based on two direct in-
frared (IR) transitions between the lowest vibrational
states in the molecule or two Raman transitions cou-
pling the vibrational levels via a near-resonant excited
electronic state.
In addition to the pumping by the
external light sources the cooling schemes are assisted
by rotational redistribution mediated by the BBR. The
timescale of the cooling schemes are on the order of ∼ 60
s which is shorter than the estimated inelastic collision
rate with background gas.

Though most molecules appearing in nature have
a 1Σ electronic ground state it is necessary to con-
sider other electronic states for molecules produced in
the laboratory, including molecular ions. The by far
most frequently encountered electronic ground states of
such molecules and molecular ions are, apart from the
1Σ state, the 2Π , 2Σ and 3Σ states. This includes the
lighter diatomic hydrides, e.g., FH+ (2Π ), BH+ (2Σ )
and OH+ (3Σ ). Such ionized hydrides are attractive can-

didates for our cooling schemes as they have low reduced
masses and hence high rotational transition frequencies
leading to fast rotational relaxation rates which is beneﬁ-
cial for the timescale of the cooling scheme. By extending
the schemes to 2Π , 2Σ and 3Σ states we have then cov-
ered all the lighter ionic hydrides and the vast majority
of other molecules amenable for cooling. We show that
it is possible to cool such electronic states, though at the
cost of introducing more laser frequencies in some cases.
For most molecules, however, the present cooling schemes
rely on only a single IR laser, possibly assisted by broad-
band radiation from a far-infrared (FIR) emitter which
is ﬁltered to optimize the cooling eﬃciency.

The present paper is organized as follows.

cooling schemes and present numerical simulations for

plicable to the 2Σ , 3Σ and 2Π electronic ground states

ing schemes. A summary of the results is given in Sec. V.
In Appendix A, we have collected the Einstein coeﬃ-
cients for the considered molecules and transitions, and
in Appendix B, we describe the H¨onl-London factors of
interest.

II. COOLING SCHEMES FOR 1Σ STATES

The suggested schemes for 1Σ states are sketched in
Fig. 1. The driven transitions are either Raman transi-
tions via an excited electronic state or transitions directly
between vibrational levels. Fig. 1(a) represents the cool-
ing scheme of Ref. [21] in which two Raman transitions
make a closed cycle through pumping of population from
the “pump states”, (ν = 0, N = 1) and (ν = 0, N = 2),
to the excited states, (ν = 1, N = 1) and (ν = 1, N = 0),
respectively, followed by subsequent spontaneous emis-
sion bringing the populations back to the “pump states”
or to the ro-vibrational ground state. Here ν and N
denotes the vibrational and rotational level respectively.
Population initially in higher-lying states is fed to the
pump states through BBR–induced rotational transitions
within the vibrational ground state.

It would be advantageous for practical implementa-
tion to use only a single Raman (Fig. 1(b)) or a sin-
gle direct (Fig. 1(c)) transition, at the expense of not
emptying the (ν = 0, N = 1) state. Without apply-
ing other means to limit the pile-up of population in the
(ν = 0, N = 1) state the cooling eﬃciency, measured as
the percentage of population in the ground state, will de-
crease. One can, however, take advantage of the higher
frequency of the (ν = 0, N = 1) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 2)
rotational transition compared to the undesired (ν =
0, N = 0) → (ν = 0, N = 1) heating transition in-
evitably driven by the BBR, and apply an incoherent
source and a high-frequency pass ﬁlter to reduce the ra-
diation resonant with the heating transition while still

2

addressing the (ν = 0, N = 1) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 2)
transition. Thereby one can obtain the desired deple-
tion of the (ν = 0, N = 1)-population by means of
incoherent radiation only. As the rate of depletion us-
ing realistic incoherent sources will be slower than if the
state was addressed by a laser, it is necessary to design
the cooling scheme such that spontaneous decays to the
(ν = 0, N = 1) state from states which are participat-
ing in the pumping cycle are avoided. This can be done
by addressing the (ν = 0, N = 2) ↔ (ν = 2, N = 0)
transition with a resonant, dipole allowed (∆N = 0, ±2)
Raman pulse as depicted in Fig. 1(b). The pumping to
the (ν = 2, N = 0) state is then followed by spontaneous
decays through (ν = 1, N = 1) to (ν = 0, N = 0) and
(ν = 0, N = 2) in accordance with the dipole selection
rules ((∆N, ∆ν) = ±1) for single photon decays.

It is shown in Ref. [21] that the Raman-transitions
in the MgH+ test case [16] are saturated by a ∼ 100
kW/cm2, 10 ns pulse, which is a modest intensity for
present day laser systems.

One of our schemes using only a single direct laser-
induced transition subject to the dipole selection rule is
shown in Fig. 1(c) [22]. The laser pumps the (ν = 0, N =
2) ↔ (ν = 1, N = 1) transition while subsequent spon-
taneous decay brings the population back to the pump
state or to the ro-vibrational ground state. A ﬁltered in-
coherent source is applied in order to bring population
from the (ν = 0, N = 1) state to the ”pump state”. The
advantage of this direct scheme is that it does not depend
on the existence of an excited electronic state that can be
addressed with laser light and also that it requires only a
single laser frequency. ArH+ is an example of a molecule
without excited electronic states [21, 23].

From a practical point of view, a pulsed laser system
is desirable for the direct scheme of Fig. 1(c). The IR
light could, for example, be generated by diﬀerence fre-
quency mixing of the primary beam of a frequency dou-
bled Nd:YAG laser and a dye laser pumped with the
In the MgH+ case, the wavelength of the
same beam.
(ν = 0, N = 2) ↔ (ν = 1, N = 1) pumping transition
is ≃ 5.9 µm [24] and the Einstein A-coeﬃcient is ≃ 20
s−1. To ensure saturation of the laser driven transition
we require that the population in the states involved un-
dergoes at least 10 Bloch oscillation during a laser pulse
and that the amplitude of each oscillation exceeds 0.9. If
we assume a detuning of 1 GHz and a pulse duration 10
ns we ﬁnd that an intensity of ∼ 500 W/mm2 is needed
to fulﬁll both requirements. This corresponds to a pulse
energy of 5 µJ. Typical nonlinear crystals should be able
to deliver an energy of ∼ 10 µJ per laser pulse at the
wavelength required.

The added incoherent ﬁeld from a lamp will increase
the rate of rotational transitions needed for cooling,
but at the expense of heating the population distribu-
tion. The spectral distribution of the incoherent ﬁeld can
therefore be shaped to maximize the cooling eﬃciency as
described in Ref. [22].

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS FOR
1Σ STATES

B. Calculation of molecular properties

In this section, we present our model of the cooling
scheme, show the results of numerical simulations and
discuss the optimal radiation distribution of the incoher-
ent ﬁeld.

A. Rate equations for the population dynamics

The population dynamics is well-described by rate
equations giving the change in population of a given state
via Einstein coeﬃcients and frequency-speciﬁc radiation
intensities. The equation of motion for the molecular
population Pi in state i takes the form

sen so the population in higher-lying rotational states
is negligible during the cooling process. Aij and Bij
are the Einstein coeﬃcients describing spontaneous and
stimulated transitions from energy level i to j. W (ωij)
is the cycle averaged radiative energy density present in
the trap at the resonant transition frequency ω = ωij,
between level i and j. In Eq. (1), the ﬁrst term corre-
sponds to spontaneous decay from state i to states with
lower energy, while the second term describes sponta-
neous decay from levels with higher energy into state i.
Stimulated emission from the ith state and stimulated
absorption from lower-lying states is then described by
the third and fourth term, and ﬁnally, the last two terms
represent transitions due to absorption of radiation from
the ith state and stimulated emission from higher-lying
states into the ith state.

The system of Eqs. (1) is conveniently expressed by

As seen from Eq. (1), it is necessary to know the Ein-
stein coeﬃcients to simulate the population dynamics.
For many molecules, the Einstein coeﬃcients are avail-
able in the literature. If not, they are evaluated numer-
ically as follows. We use the well-known quantum me-
chanical expressions for the Einstein coeﬃcients between
an upper state Ψn and a lower state Ψm that are both
non-degenerate [25]

The H¨onl-London factors, SJm,Jn , are tabulated in the
literature [24, 26, 27, 28] and may be evaluated by the ex-
pressions given in Appendix B. Both the potential energy
curve for the molecule and the electronic dipole moment
(R) is evaluated with Gaussian [29]. From
function Dmol
the potential energy curve the ro-vibrational eigenfunc-
tions, fνn, are readily found using the Numerov method,
and the one-dimensional integral of Eq. (8) can be evalu-
ated. We use the Level 7.5 program [30] to perform these
tasks and to evaluate Eq. (7), leaving us with the desired
Einstein coeﬃcients.

1. Einstein coeﬃcients for MgH+

Since translational cold samples of MgH+ have been
produced in a trap loaded with laser cooled Mg+ atomic
ions [16], this molecular ion is the ﬁrst choice for an im-
plementation of the presented cooling schemes. To our
knowledge only a few Einstein coeﬃcients for transitions
within the electronic ground state have been published
[21]. We have re-calculated the coeﬃcients using the ap-
proach of the previous section. The potential curves ob-
tained from Gaussian [29] using various theoretical ap-
proaches on a 6-311++G basis set [31] is given in Fig. 2
together with the corresponding dipole moment functions
in the molecular center of mass system. The potential
curves show convincing convergence and our derived vi-
brational transition frequencies and equilibrium distance
agree with published data within 1.5% [24]. To compute
the accurate electronic dipole moment function is more
challenging, since this requires accurate electronic wave
functions. Generally the Mller-Plesset fourth-order per-
turbation theory [35] and the coupled-cluster theories [36]
are reliable for the task. The dipole moment functions
converge against a unique function as the level of approx-
imation is reﬁned as shown in Fig. 2 indicating that the
highest order CCSDT function is a good approximation
to the physical dipole moment function. Furthermore,
we have performed equivalent calculations on the isoelec-
tronic molecules NaH and BeH+ [37, 38, 39] to compare
our results with other published calculations. The re-
sults were in agreement within 5%, a level which is not
critical for the simulations of the cooling schemes. The
calculated Einstein coeﬃcients are given in appendix A.
We have now set up the model and acquired the pa-
rameters entering the coupling matrix K in Eq. (3) and
the solution can now be found numerically using stan-
dard methods as described below.

C. Solving the population dynamics

We model the dynamics of the cooling on the test case
of MgH+ by solving Eq. (3) [40]. In the population vec-
tor, P , of Eq. (2) we use Nmax = 20 since the popu-
lation of this and higher-lying levels is eﬀectively zero
during the cooling process.
In addition, we omit the
(ν = 2, N ) states in the cooling schemes if the second
excited vibrational state is not coupled by laser ﬁelds.
The radiation density W (ω) at resonance between lev-
els not addressed by lasers has been calculated from a
Boltzmann distribution at 300 K plus incoherent ﬁelds
from lamps as described below. The pulsed lasers are in-
cluded by saturating the pumped transitions, described
in Sec. II, at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. In the simula-
tion this is done by redistributing the population in the
involved ro-vibrational levels at the given repetition rate
according to the degeneracy of the levels. All simulations
are made with populations which are initially Boltzmann
distributed at a temperature of 300K. The shape of the

4

incoherent ﬁeld is chosen so it maximizes the ﬁnal popu-
lation in the rovibrational ground state.

All simulations are made with the most abundant iso-

topes, in this case 24Mg1H+ (79%).

D. Eﬃciency of 1Σ cooling schemes

In Ref. [22] we found that the optimized radiation den-
sity at intermediate timescales induces transitions up to
and including the peak of the population distribution in
BBR alone at 300K. Speciﬁcally, for MgH+ the optimized
spectral distribution of the incoherent source used in the
schemes of Fig. 1(b) and 1(c) is found to be a square dis-
tribution with the maximal density allowed on the rota-
tional transitions from (ν = 0, N = 1) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 2)
to (ν = 0, N = 3) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 4). Furthermore, we
showed that the spectral radiation density reaching the
molecular ions from a realistic lamp is approximately 5
times the spectral radiation energy density of BBR at
300K. This has been included as a constraint in the op-
timization of the incoherent ﬁeld.

While the cooling eﬃciency at a given time depends
critically on the ability to ﬁlter out radiation addressing
the heating transition in the low-frequency end of the
distribution, it is only weakly depending on the sharp-
ness of the ﬁlter in the high-frequency end. This is il-
lustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 by the inclusion of a sim-
ulation using a square incoherent ﬁeld addressing the
transitions (ν = 0, N = 1) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 2) to
(ν = 0, N = 7) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 8) roughly correspond-
ing to the cutoﬀ frequency of a crystalline quartz win-
dow [41]. This distribution will be referred to as the
”quartz-ﬁltered” distribution below. Simulations of the
evolution of ro-vibrational ground state population of
MgH+ during cooling with the direct and Raman scheme
using these two incoherent ﬁelds are presented in Fig. 3
together with the results obtained without the inclusion
of an incoherent source and those obtained by applying
the scheme of Ref. [21] (Fig. 1(a)).

For very short cooling times no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the schemes is seen as the relatively slow rota-
tional transitions have not yet set in. On intermediate
time-scales the eﬀect of the added incoherent ﬁeld is ev-
ident and the optimized scheme has an advantage to the
scheme of Ref. [21] at times less than ∼ 100 s. At long
times the slower depletion of the (ν = 0, N = 1) state us-
ing the incoherent ﬁeld rather than a laser, as well as the
heating eﬀect of the added radiation makes the scheme
of Ref. [21] more eﬀective than the other schemes.

The schemes presented here has the advantage of
reaching signiﬁcant cooling after ∼ 30 s which, com-
bined with the modest demands to coherent light sources,
makes them experimentally attractive. Anticipated per-
formance of traps for neutrals give storage times ex-
ceeding 10 s, comparable to the timescale of the cooling
schemes applied on MgH+ [5] and in the same regime as
ArH+ , which is a faster candidate [21]. Hence the appli-

cation of the schemes may be considered to create rota-
tionally cold neutral molecules in the presence of BBR.

The population distribution after 60 s of cooling is
compared with the initial Boltzmann distribution in Fig.
4. The depletion of the rotational levels above the N = 2
“pump state” is evident. The diﬀerence between using
the optimized and quartz-ﬁltered spectral distribution of
incoherent light can be seen in the ﬁgures, but the eﬀect
is very limited.

The ﬁnal population in the ro-vibrational ground state
of just below 80%, c.f. Fig. 4, corresponds to the ground
state population of a thermal ensemble of MgH+ at ∼7
K.

IV. COOLING SCHEME FOR MOLECULES
WITH ROTATIONAL SUB-STRUCTURE

In the previous sections, we discussed cooling schemes
applicable to molecular ions with their ro-vibrational en-
ergy levels determined by molecular rotation and vibra-
tion only. This will be the case if the relevant electronic
state has vanishing total spin and if the projection of the
orbital angular momentum of the electronic state along
the internuclear axis is zero, i.e., in 1Σ states. We now
turn to the other electronic ground states found in lighter
diatomic hydride ions: 2Σ , 3Σ and 2Π

A range of quantum numbers will be needed to describe
the rotational sub-states of the molecules to be discussed.
We follow the notation of Herzberg [24] designating the
quantum numbers as indicated in Table I. The meaning
of the coupled angular momenta is explained below.

We now treat Hunds coupling case (a) and (b) sepa-

rately and study cooling schemes for both cases.

5

A.

(2S+1)Π-states; Hunds case (a)

An interaction term of the form H so = AL · S will
appear in the Hamiltonian if the projection on the in-
ternuclear axis of both electronic spin, S, and electronic
orbital angular momenta, L, are nonzero. For moderate
rotational excitations this will normally dominate over
terms from the rotational Hamiltonian, H rot = B · N 2.
It is therefore convenient to choose the Hunds case (a)
n, S2J 2MJ ΛΣΩ
basis set, consisting of basis functions
where n is collecting the quantum numbers deﬁning the
(cid:11)
molecular state but not mentioned in Table I.
In this
basis set, the unperturbed Hamiltonian, H0 is diagonal
and the main perturbation term H so is nearly diago-
nal with the oﬀ-diagonal terms satisfying ∆Ω = 0. The
n, S2J 2MJ ΛΣΩ
basis states are therefore a good ap-
proximation to eigenfunctions with good quantum num-
(cid:12)
bers if |A| ≫ B · J.
In the following section, we re-
(cid:12)
strict the calculation to the pure Hunds case (a) limit
where this condition is fulﬁlled. 2Π states are often close
to this limit at low rotational excitations and they form
the most interesting example of Hunds case (a) coupling
for our purpose, as they are found as ground states of
a number of molecules interesting for cooling, including
NH+ and FH+ .

1. Energy levels and selection rules

The ﬁrst order eﬀect of H so is to split the electronic
ground state into states according to the value of Ω. For
each of these states there will be a set of ro-vibrational
sub-states arising from H rot.

In Hunds case (a), the molecule is well-described as a
rotating symmetric top, for which the rotational energies
are expressed by [24]

Fν (J) = Bν(J(J + 1) − Ω2).

(9)

Here J must take values greater than |Ω−N | and the low-
est rotational state will therefore, in general, have J 6= 0.
The overall structure of the molecular energy levels can
be seen from the sketch of the modiﬁed cooling scheme
in Fig. 5 for S = 1
2 .

The case (a) basis state in the laboratory frame can be
written as a Wigner rotation of the corresponding wave
function in the molecular rest frame [42]

(12)

which can also be combined to ∆Ω = 0.

2. Cooling schemes

For 2Π molecules we propose the cooling scheme de-
picted in Fig. 5, where we distinguish between the pos-
sible values of Ω = 1
2 and Ω = 3
2 . Since only transi-
tions with ∆J = 0, ±1 are allowed, we can pump pop-
ulation from the ﬁrst excited rotational state in the vi-
brational ground state to the rotational ground state of
the ﬁrst excited vibrational level. The former is denoted
the ”pump state” in analogy with the nomenclature in
Sec. II. From the (ν = 1, J = Ω) state spontaneous emis-
sion brings population either back to the pump state or
down to the ro-vibrational ground state. The cooling
scheme must be applied for each populated Ω state indi-
vidually. In Fig. 5 we have assumed population of both
Ω = 1
2 . In the absence of incoherent radi-
ation this forms a pumping cycle where population ini-
tially in the (ν, J) = (0, Ω + 1) state is transferred to
the ro-vibrational ground state. As in the singlet case,
the presence of BBR and possibly additional incoherent
radiation from a lamp, will induce rotational transitions
and thereby feed the pump state with population from
higher-lying states. The entire population is therefore
cooled.

2 and Ω = 3

Cooling schemes for other Hunds case (a) molecules
may be derived from straightforward generalization of
the 2Π scheme.

3. Numerical simulations

The simulation is done using the approach described in
Sec. III C but with the dipole transition matrix elements
calculated using the H¨onl-London factors of Eq. (11).
We have chosen the molecule FH+ as an example of a
2Π ground state molecule.

Since the spin-orbit coupling parameter A = −292
cm−1 is much larger in magnitude than the rotational
constant B = 17 cm−1 FH+ is best described in the
Hunds case (a) scheme [44]. The appropriate cooling
scheme is depicted in Fig. 5, although it should be noted
that, for FH+ , Ω = 3
2 is the lower state. To model the

6

cooling scheme we use the dipole moment functions in
Ref. [45] and the accurate spectroscopic data of Ref. [44].
In the cooling scheme of Fig. 5 the pumping is done
from the ﬁrst excited rotational level. This fact, com-
bined with a large permanent dipole moment and hence
rotational transition rate of FH+ (2.57 Debye), makes the
eﬀect of the broadband incoherent radiation marginal.
We have therefore performed the simulations without the
inclusion of an incoherent source. The results of simula-
tions are given for both the 2Π 1/2 and 2Π 3/2 states in
Figs. 6 and 7.

2

Further splitting of the levels indicated in Fig. 5 will
appear due to Λ doubling. The eﬀect is largest in the
2Π 1
state where it has a magnitude on the order of 10
GHz, which is more than one can expect to cover with the
bandwidth of a single pulsed laser. Therefore the laser
transitions indicated for the 2Π 1
2 scheme needs to be
divided into two. The splitting of the lowest 2Π 3
2 state
is an order of magnitude smaller, so it is not necessary to
split that laser transition if a pulsed laser system is used.
This leaves us with three laser frequencies to use for the
cooling scheme if we assume that both Ω = 1
2 and Ω = 3
are populated.

2

Complications arise if we are not in the pure Hunds
case (a) scheme. This occurs if the rotational part of the
Hamiltonian cannot be neglected compared to the spin-
orbit part. Treated in the case (a) basis, the rotational
part will produce non diagonal perturbations [46]. This
would allow a coupling from (ν = 1, J = Ω) → (ν =
0, J = Ω + 2) (the introduction of quadrupole couplings
would have a similar eﬀect). We do not expect this eﬀect
to be signiﬁcant given the diﬀerence between |A| and B.
We did, however, check the stability of the scheme when
introducing such couplings and found that due to the fast
rotational redistribution rates, the population that was
coupled out of the cooling cycle by ∆J = 2 transitions
would rapidly be taken back. The negative eﬀect of such
couplings is small (less than 10% decrease in cooling ef-
ﬁciency) if the ∆J = ±2 couplings are less than 20% of
the ∆J = 0 coupling strength.

It should be noted that since the coupling between the
Ω states is also absent in the pure case (a) coupling, it
would be possible to prepare the sample so that only the
Ω = 3
2 sub-state is populated, due to its signiﬁcantly
lower energy. This would make the lasers addressing the
other level superﬂuous. In that case only a single laser
frequency is needed to cool the molecules.

in the laboratory frame as

1. Energy levels of doublet states

The sub-states of a rotational level in a molecule in a
2Σ state are split due to the interaction of the spin of the
unpaired electron and the molecular rotational angular
momentum. This is due to the spin-rotation Hamilto-
nian, H sr = γN · S, with γ denoting the spin-rotation
coupling constant. The resulting energies of the doublet
are given by [24]

F1(N ) = BN (N + 1) +

F2(N ) = BN (N + 1) −

and the sub-states are denoted F1 and F2 for J = N + 1

and J = N − 1

2 respectively.

2. Energy levels of triplet states

Molecular ions in 3Σ electronic states will, apart from
the spin-rotation splitting discussed above, have an ad-
ditional splitting from the coupling of the electronic spin
of the two unpaired electrons. Such states are relatively
rare, as pairing of the electronic spins is usually favored.
Nevertheless, the ionic hydrides in the 16th group of the
periodic table, including OH+ and SH+ , have such elec-
tronic ground states and we therefore consider the appli-
cability of the cooling schemes to such states here. The
energies of the three spin sub-states are given by [24]

F1(N ) = BN (N + 1) +

+ γ(N + 1),(15)

F2(N ) = BN (N + 1),

the sub-states with J = N + 1, J = N and J = N − 1,
respectively. In the expression γ is the spin-rotation cou-
pling constant and λ is the spin-spin–splitting constant.
The latter is normally an order of magnitude or more
larger than γ and, consequently, the multiplet splitting
of triplet states at moderate rotational excitations are
much greater than the corresponding splittings of a dou-
blet electronic states.

cooling scheme

The cooling scheme proposed for Hunds case (b)
molecules closely resembles the singlet cooling scheme.
It is depicted in Fig. 8 for 2Σ molecules and in Fig. 9
for 3Σ molecules. The optical pumping is done from the
(ν = 0, N = 2, J) set of states to (ν = 1, N = 1, J ′).
Then dipole allowed spontaneous decay will result in
transitions back to the ”pump states” or to the non-
degenerate ro-vibrational ground state. The only change
to the scheme when compared to the singlet case is to as-
sure the addressing of all sub-states in the N multiplet.
This is possible because the ∆N = ±1 selection rule for
Σ states from Eq. (20) is the same as in the singlet case.
The role of BBR and additional incoherent radiation is
the same as in the previous schemes.

The number of transitions to be pumped is three for
the 3Σ states and two for the 2Σ states. The splitting of
the levels in the former is expected to be much larger than
for the 2Σ case, since the spin-spin coupling parameter
λ is much greater than the spin-rotation parameter γ as
mentioned in Sec. IV B.

3. Selection rules

In Hunds case (b) the good quantum numbers are
N, S, J, MJ and Λ. We therefore write the eigenfunctions

Here we treat BH+ as an example of a 2Σ ground state
molecule and discuss the molecule speciﬁc parameters
and their implications on the cooling schemes.

5. Numerical simulations; BH+ (2Σ )

The numerical simulation is done for 11B1H+ which is
the dominant isotope (80%). We use the potential en-
ergy and dipole moment functions of Ref. [47]. With
those functions, we use the approach of Sec. IV B 3 to
calculate the matrix of Einstein coeﬃcients between ro-
tational and vibrational states. Finally, we make the sim-
ulation as described in Sec. III C but with the modiﬁed
energy level structure. If one neglects ﬁne-structure, the
laser wavelength for the two, then identical, pump tran-
sitions depicted in Fig. 8, is Ω0 = 4.17µm. The real
resonant transition frequencies are shifted from this cen-
tral frequency through Eq. (13) where γ = −0.014 cm−1
[24]. This gives a splitting of laser frequencies, including
ﬁne structure, of ±0.007 cm−1 ≃ ±210 MHz. This diﬀer-
ence is comfortably smaller than the typical bandwidth
of a pulsed laser system. The hyperﬁne coupling coeﬃ-
cient has, to our knowledge, not been calculated. Typi-
cal values are, however, on the order tens to hundreds of
MHz, allowing us to address all hyperﬁne substates with
the same pulsed laser system. Hence, it is reasonable to
expect that for practical implementations only a single,
pulsed laser frequency is needed.

The results of a numerical simulation are given in
Figs. 10 and 11. We note that the convergence is quite
slow compared to what we saw from MgH+ and FH+ .
Optimal cooling is not obtained until after ∼ 2 min-
utes. This is not too critical as 60 % of the popu-
lation is in the ground state after 20 s. As expected
from the discussion in Ref. [22] we ﬁnd, that the op-
timized distribution of the incoherent source addresses
the transitions (ν = 0, N = 1) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 2) and
(ν = 0, N = 2) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 3). Similarly it is con-
ﬁrmed, that the cooling eﬃciency has little sensitivity
towards the high frequency cutoﬀ of the incoherent ﬁeld.

6. Numerical simulations; OH+ (3Σ )

As an example of a molecule with the 3Σ ground state
we have chosen OH+ . This molecule plays an important
role in the chemistry in comet tails [13], the upper earth
atmosphere and interstellar clouds [49]. The electronic
ground state of OH+ is 3Σ−. The eﬀect of hyperﬁne split-
tings is expected to be much smaller than the bandwidth
of a typical pulsed laser system due to the nuclear spins
I = 0 and I = 1
2 of O and H respectively. Hence the
molecule is well-described by the level scheme of Fig. 9.
The frequencies of the three laser beams required are
found from Eq. (15) and the constants γ = −0.0147 cm−1
and λ = 2.13 cm−1 [24]. The wavelength of the un-split
transition is 3.3 µm with the three sub-transitions shifted
-3.2 GHz, 0 and -12 GHz with respect to it. This splitting
is to large to be covered by a single broad laser unless one
ﬁnds a way to generate shorter and thereby broader and
more intense pulses in this wavelength regime. This is an
obvious experimental complication that will often arise in
the case of 3Σ states due to the generally large value of
the spin-spin splitting constant λ. It should, however, be

8

noted that the 3 GHz may be covered by a single pulsed
laser, leaving only two laser frequencies in the cooling
scheme. We have calculated the dipole moment func-
tions of OH+ and compared our results to Ref. [48] in
Fig. 12. In the simulations we use the function obtained
in the CCSDT (aug-cc-pVTZ) calculation.

The ﬁnal population distribution in the numerical sim-
ulation is given in Fig. 13. The scheme is both faster and
more eﬀective than what was found for MgH+ . This
can be understood from comparison of the Figs. 2 and
12. A larger gradient of the dipole moment function of
OH+ results in a higher eﬀective pump rate from N = 2
to N = 0. As with MgH+ we see a signiﬁcant increase
in the cooling eﬃciency when introducing broadband ra-
diation from an incoherent source to deplete the N = 1
population.

The simulation shows the eﬃciency of the rotational re-
distribution in the 3Σ state. Considering the nonzero line
strengths for transitions between the Fi, FJ , (i 6= j) se-
ries of states, provided ∆N = ±1, one could be tempted
to omit one or more laser frequencies expecting rota-
tional redistribution to empty the remaining substates
by rotational transitions through neighboring N -levels.
Unfortunately such redistribution rates, requiring two
or more rotational transitions through speciﬁc substates,
are much too slow to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the cool-
ing scheme. Therefore each of the three laser frequencies
are needed to make the cooling scheme eﬀective. In ac-
cordance with the previous results we ﬁnd that the op-
timized distribution of incoherent radiation from a lamp
addresses only the (ν = 0, N = 1) ↔ (ν = 0, N = 2)
transition.

Finally, it should be noted that 2S+1Σ-states are al-
ways cases of pure case (b) coupling due to the vanishing
orbital angular momentum and the selection rule in N is
close to exact. This stands in contrast to 2S+1Π states
which often have eﬀects of intermediate coupling which
will complicate the suggested case (a) cooling scheme fur-
ther.

V. SUMMARY

We have presented cooling schemes for rotational cool-
ing of translational cold molecular ions in the 1Σ , 2Σ ,
3Σ and 2Π electronic ground states. For all but the rela-
tively rare 3Σ electronic state the schemes can be realized
by optical pumping with a single pulsed laser beam, pos-
sibly combined with the inclusion of a broad-band inco-
herent source. They are therefore experimentally attrac-
tive, and preliminary experiments are presently under
way with MgH+ .

Possible applications

include high-precision spec-
troscopy and measurements of absolute reaction rates
with molecular ions in a single, well deﬁned quantum
state. This could for example be used to study disso-
ciative recombination with unprecedented resolution or
molecular reactions in interstellar media or comet tails

[11, 12]. Ultimately, the access to cold molecular ions
could be used in implementations of quantum logics.

similar notation is used for the transition frequencies. The pure rotational transition rates (ﬁrst column) indicate the rotational
redistribution speed while the vibrational transition rates give the spontaneous decay rate from the excited vibrational state
in the pumping schemes. The data largely explains the qualitative diﬀerence in cooling eﬃciency for the molecular ions. Large
rotational redistribution rates indicate a fast scheme, while fast spontaneous decays from the excited vibrational state indicate
high eﬀective pump rate, i.e. high cooling eﬃciency. The data for BH+ is found using the data from Ref. [47] and the computer
programme of Ref. [30] from which the H¨onl-London factors were corrected to conform with the multiplet expressions of Sec. IV.
Data for OH+ was found using the same approach and data from Fig. 12. Finally the data on FH+ was obtained using the data
of Refs. [44, 45].

The molecular states are degenerate so it is necessary
to sum over all sub-states to obtain the transition dipole
moment deﬁned in Eq. (B1). In the case of 1Σ molecules
this corresponds to summing over all projections MJ of
the molecular angular momentum J. In carrying out the
summation over the sub-states in Eq. (B1) the selection
rule ∆MJ = 0, ±1 makes it possible to rewrite the expres-
sion as a single sum over µ = MJ which can be related to
the total transition dipole moment. Since the transition

ods give an accurate description of the problem. Bottom:
Corresponding dipole moment functions, Dmol

Gaussian. The MPn and coupled cluster theories largely agree
around the equilibrium distance, although not as well as for
the potential curve due to the dependence on electronic wave
functions rather than eigenenergies. The classical turning
points for the vibrational ground state are marked on the
common abscissa at 1.5 and 1.8 ˚A. The result of the MP2
calculation cannot be discriminated from the MP4 result at
the internuclear distances of interest.

with the inclusion of the ﬁeld from an incoherent source ad-

(solid line). We see that a signiﬁcant improvement is obtain-
able using the incoherent source. In line with our experience
from MgH+ there is only a couple of percent loss of cooling
eﬃciency when using a softer low-frequency pass ﬁlter, for ex-
ample, letting the broadband incoherent radiation extend to
include transitions up to and including N = 4 → N = 5.

small. The substructure of the rotational levels is included in

FIG. 12: Top: Born-Oppenheimer potential curves for X3Σ
OH+ calculated by Gaussian with various theoretical models
compared to the calculation of Ref. [48]. All our calculations
are done in a 6-311++G basis set except the solid black line
which is made in the generally more accurate aug-cc-pVTZ
basis [31]. The curves agree close to the equilibrium, 1.03˚A,
for the MP4 (Fourth order Møller-Plesset perturbation the-
ory) and Coupled Cluster approaches (CCD, CCSDT) indi-
cating an accurate level of theory. The diﬀerent methods are
described in Refs.
[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Bottom: Dipole mo-
ment function calculated with Gaussian using similar levels
of theory and basis sets. The agreement between the calcula-
tions is reasonable and the eﬀect of using the larger basis set
for the CCSDT theory is not visible on the given scale, but
our results show some discrepancy with the results of Ref. [48].
This small discrepancy, however, has very little eﬀect on the
cooling scheme. The classical turning points for the vibra-
tional ground state are marked on the common abscissa at
0.95 and 1.15 ˚A. The dipole moment functions are given in
center of mass coordinates.

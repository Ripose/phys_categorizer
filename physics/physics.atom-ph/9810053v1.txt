The convergent close-coupling method is applied to the
calculation of fully diﬀerential cross sections for ionization of
atomic hydrogen by 15.6 eV electrons. We ﬁnd that even at
this low energy the method is able to yield predictive results
with small uncertainty. The reason for the success of the
method is investigated and explained.

34.80.Bm, 34.80.Dp

At the base of all electron-atom scattering and ioniza-
tion problems is the fundamental, yet unsolved, three-
body problem of an electron interacting with atomic hy-
drogen. This problem occupies a special place in the
set of unsolved problems of interest to physicists due to
its fundamental nature in the realm of atomic physics. It
represents a class of Coulomb three-body problems which
includes electron interaction with the single positive ion
of helium, and hence the problem of helium double pho-
toionization. For these reasons one of the Centennial
Symposia of the 1999 meeting of the American Physical
Society is devoted to the study of such problems.

For heavier atoms the complexity of the Coulomb
three-body problem may be masked by the collective be-
havior of the many target electrons. Similarly, for high
incident electron energies the complicated role played by
the long-ranged Coulomb interaction is also somewhat
hidden. The problem exhibits all of its complexities at
energies a little above the ionization threshold. Here we
have the possibility of exciting a countably inﬁnite num-
ber of the hydrogen discrete states as well as the three-
body continuum of two very slow strongly interacting
electrons. In this Letter we consider the e-H problem at
the incident electron energy of 15.6 eV, i.e. only 2 eV
above the ionization threshold.

To solve the e-H problem means to correctly predict
all of the possible scattering amplitudes for both the dis-
crete f S
n (k) and continuum f S(kA, kB) transitions for a
total spin S. For the discrete transitions close-coupling
methods have proved to be the most successful, particu-
larly at low energies. These rely on expanding the total
wave function in a set of orthonormal states. From the
landmark work of Yamani and Reinhardt [1], followed
by Broad [2], Stelbovics [3] and others, it became clear

that the set of orthonormal states obtained by diagonal-
ising the target Hamiltonian in a Laguerre basis formed
an unusual equivalent-quadrature rule. Thus-obtained
states provide a ﬁnite N quadrature rule that incorpo-
rates both the inﬁnite set of true target discrete states
and the target continuum. This is an immensely pow-
erful result and forms the basis of the convergent close-
coupling (CCC) method for the calculation of electron-
atom scattering [4,5,6]. The idea relies on simply increas-
ing N until convergence in the parameter of interest is
obtained to an acceptable accuracy, just like with stan-
dard numerical quadrature. This approach has proved
very successful for the disrete transitions at all energies.
In the rare case of substantial discrepancy with experi-
ment [4] subsequent new measurements were found to be
in agreement with the CCC theory [7].

Obtaining reliable scattering amplitudes f S

n (k) for the
discrete transitions is a good start, but what about ion-
ization? The expansion-states φn have both negative and
positive energies ǫn. By summing the cross sections, ob-
tained upon solution of the close-coupling equations, for
just the positive energy states yields excellent agreement
with the measurements of the e-H total ionization cross
section [8,9,10]. Though this is the least detailed ioniza-
tion process it is an encouraging ﬁrst step. The question
is: do the scattering amplitudes f S
n (k) for ǫn > 0 contain
all of the detailed ionization information?

The work of Bray and Fursa [11] attempted to pro-
vide a correct interpretation of the already calculated
positive-energy-state scattering amplitudes, with some
confronting and controversial results. It was shown that
the ionization amplitudes may be deﬁned from the f S
n (k)
by

(kA, kB) = hk(−)

(1)

B/2 + k2

B/2 = ǫB, and where k2

where k(−)
B is a Coulomb wave (in the case of H target)
of energy k2
A/2 = E, the
total (excess) energy. This deﬁnition is in fact a simpliﬁ-
cation of the pioneering work of Curran and Walters [12].
The overlap has the eﬀect of changing the unity normal-
ization of φB to that of the true continuum, as well as
introducing a one-electron Coulomb phase. The contro-
versy [13] arises not from the above deﬁnition, but from
the subsequent use of (1) to deﬁne the triply diﬀerential
cross section (TDCS) by

d3σS(kA, kB)
dΩAdΩBdEA

= |f S(kA, kB)|2 + |f S(kB, kA)|2.

(2)

The second term above looks like an exchange term, but
it is not. The close-coupling equations are solved sepa-
rately for each total spin S. Thus, the amplitudes f S
n (k),
and hence f S(kA, kB) are already a coherent combina-
tion of their own direct and exchange amplitudes as de-
termined by S. The two terms have very diﬀerent origin,
see (1). The amplitude f S
B(kA) arises from the excita-
tion of the state φn with ǫn = ǫB, with the boundary
condition that the “kA” electron exits as a plane wave
totally shielded from the ion by the other electron in
(bound) state φB. If ǫB < k2
A/2 then this is the physi-
cally sound shielding approximation, but then the bound-
ary conditions for the amplitude f S
A(kB) are unphysical
(low-energy outgoing plane wave shielded by a higher en-
ergy bound state). Yet, these two theoretically distin-
guishable amplitudes correspond to the same ionization
process since E = ǫA + ǫB. For E′ = ǫA + ǫB + ∆E these
amplitudes still arise, but would correspond to diﬀerent
ionization processes.

From (2) we see that close-coupling yields twice as
many amplitudes as we may expect from formal ioniza-
tion theory. A careful numerical study of the problem
led to the suggestion that with increasing N the second
term in (2) converges to zero [14]. This brings about
consistency with formal ionization theory. However, for
ﬁnite N a consistent interpretation of the close-coupling
approach to ionization requires the use of both terms.
A further consequence of the numerical study [14] is
that the close-coupling method is unable to obtain con-
vergence in the singly diﬀerential cross section (SDCS)
whenever the true SDCS at equal energy sharing is sub-
stantial. Nevertheless, it was argued, that if the true
SDCS was known then accurate ionization cross sections
could still be predicted.

The concept of convergence with increasing N =
l≤lmax Nl involves both the increase of lmax and Nl.
We will denote the CCC calculations by CCC(N0, lmax)
P
with Nl = N0 − l. To examine the rate of convergence
we perform two vastly diﬀerent calculations CCC(20,5)
and CCC(13,4), which require approximately 2Gb and
500Mb of computer core memory, respectively. In both
cases the Laguerre exponential fall-oﬀ paramater was set
λl ≈ 0.6 with the variation performed to ensure that for
each l there was a state φnl with energy ǫnl=1 eV.

The ﬁrst test of the calculations is the comparison of
the total ionization cross sections (TICS) and its spin
asymmetry AI with the highly accurate measurement
[15] of TICS 1.08 (10−17cm2) and the AI ≈ 0.5 measure-
ments [16,17]. The CCC(20,5) and CCC(13,4) results for
the TICS, AI are 1.18, 0.50 and 0.91, 0.51, respectively.
Thus, we see that both calculations attribute approxi-
mately the correct amount of electron ﬂux to the two
spin ionization channels.

Next, in Fig. 1, we consider the energy distribution

within the ionization channels, i.e. the SDCS

FIG. 1. The singly diﬀerential cross sections arising in the
CCC(N0, lmax) (see text) calculations. The step function la-
beled by CCC(∞, 5) is an integral preserving estimate.

The spin-averaged SDCS is presented. We see that
there is no convergence in the CCC(20,5) and CCC(13,4)
SDCS, though the integral of both is much the same.
The step function CCC(∞, 5) is an estimate of what the
CCC-calculated SDCS would converge to for N0 = ∞
(there are no problems in obtaining convergence with in-
creasing lmax). In other words, we assume that at this
low energy the true SDCS is approximately ﬂat. The
SDCS symmetrically on either side of 1 eV correspond to
the same ionization process and is why we have the two
terms in (2). For the asymmetric energy-sharing only one
term contributes signiﬁcantly, but both are signiﬁcant at
equal energy sharing. Before looking at the angular dis-
tributions determined by (2) it is clear from Fig. 1 that
their magnitude will be wrong. In order that integration
of (2) over the angular variables yielded the estimated
SDCS of 1.08 (10−17cm2/eV) we will multiply the CCC
EA = EB = 1 eV TDCS by 1.08/(0.2 × 2) = 2.7.

In Figs. 2, 3, and 4 we present the TDCS calculated by
the two CCC models and compare these with experiment
and the previously overall best agreement yielding the-
ory, the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) of
Jones, Madison, and Srivastava [18]. The relative mea-
surements were initially presented by Brauner et al. [19],
but were remeasured and put on the absolute scale, with
estimated 35% uncertainty, by R¨oder et al. [20]. The
DWBA calculations [18] work relatively well at this low
energy since they utilise the eﬀective charge formalism of
Rudge [21] in the distorting potentials. For an example of
a more common DWBA approach and the 3C theory see
Rouet, Tweed, and Langlois [22] and Brauner et al. [19],
respectively.

In the TDCS ﬁgures we use the convenient, for the
coplanar geometry, convention that the negative scatter-
ing angles are on the opposite side of the incident beam
(z-axis). For best visual comparison with the rescaled

CCC calculations we have multiplied all of the exper-
imental values by the single constant of 0.45. Having
done so, we see excellent agreement between the two
CCC calculations and experiment, which is of consid-
erable improvement on the comparison with the DWBA
calculation. The quality of the agreement gives us conﬁ-
dence that the rescaling of the experiment has brought it
into consistency with the estimated SDCS value of 1.08
(10−17cm2/eV). Should the true SDCS prove to be a lit-
tle convex then the experimental rescaling should be done
by a factor a little greater than 0.45. Perhaps the exper-
imentally determined normalization is an indication that
this may indeed be so.

tally accessible.
In fact, smaller θAB geometries yield
even greater diﬀerences. Such geometries, ﬁrst suggested
by Whelan, Allan, and Walters [23], are an excellent test

of the CCC theory because the cross sections fall rapidly
with decreasing θAB. We see that the bigger calcula-
tion yields the smaller cross section. This is an impor-
tant indication of how well the CCC theory is working.
For the other presented cases the fact that the shapes
of the two calculations are much the same, even though
one requires four times as much computational resources
as the other, suggests rapid shape convergence for the
largest cross sections. On the other hand, almost iden-
tical overall magnitude suggests that convergence to the
true correct SDCS is extremely slow.

Coulomb three-body problem, but curiously, has pushed
the uncertainty to just that of determining the shape of
the SDCS.

So how is it that the CCC theory yields such good
TDCS angular distributions? To help answer this ques-
tion let us have a look in more detail at Fig. 4. Given
the good agreement between CCC(13,4) and CCC(20,5)
TDCS one would imagine that one may readily inter-
change the partial wave amplitudes of (1) hkl||φnlif S
nl in
the two calculations. The curve labeled by CCC(mix)
was generated by taking the 1 eV l = 1 partial wave am-
plitude of the CCC(20,5) calculation and using it with
the remaining CCC(13,4) amplitudes. Whereas one may
reasonably expect the CCC(mix) calculated TDCS to be
between the other two, it diﬀers substantially when the
two electrons emerge close together. This is an indication
of the importance of treating all partial waves in a consis-
tent manner. The Laguerre basis choice Nl = N0 − l with
similar λl results in much the same integration rule over
the true continuum for each l. In other words, the num-
ber of positive energy states and their separation is simi-
lar for each l. We also use the same set of states for each
partial wave of total orbital angular momentum J. Thus,
for each J, the error in the energy distribution is also very
similar for each l, and this is why the CCC(N0, lmax) cal-
culations yield good TDCS angular distributions whose
magnitude is in error by a single constant.

Concluding, it seems that the CCC theory is able to
yield accurate TDCS angular distributions for all kine-
matical conditions, with the error in the magnitudes
being determined simply from the error in the CCC-

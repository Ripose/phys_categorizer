I present a microscopic description of Hawking radiation in sonic black holes. A one-dimensional
Fermi-degenerate liquid squeezed by a smooth barrier forms a transonic ﬂow, a sonic analogue of
a black hole. The quantum treatment of the non-interacting case establishes a close relationship
between the Hawking radiation and quantum tunnelling through the barrier. Quasi-particle exci-
tations appear at the barrier and are then radiated with a thermal distribution in exact agreement
with Hawking’s formula. The signature of the radiation can be found in the dynamic structure fac-
tor, which can be measured in a scattering experiment. The possibility for experimental veriﬁcation
of this new transport phenomenon for ultra-cold atoms is discussed.

Introduction. — One of the most fascinating eﬀects in
astrophysics is Hawking’s prediction of black hole radia-
tion [1]. Hawking realized that particles such as neutri-
nos and photons could be created spontaneously from any
black hole and emitted at just the rate that one would
expect if the black hole is a body with a temperature
~κ/2πkB proportional to its surface gravity κ. Although
Hawking’s prediction combines gravitation and quantum
mechanics to produce thermodynamics, it was rapidly
appreciated that the radiation predicted by Hawking is
more primitive and fundamental. A beautiful example
of this was pointed out by Unruh [2]: The propagation
of sound in a ﬂuid/gas turning supersonic, such as in
the nozzle of a rocket engine, is similar to the propaga-
tion of a scalar ﬁeld close to a black hole. By adapting
Hawking’s derivation, Unruh predicted the analogue of
Hawking radiation for sound waves in a moving ﬂuid.
This sonic analogue could provide a way to experimen-
tally test Hawking’s eﬀect.

Although Unruh’s prediction is not restricted a pri-
ori to a speciﬁc ﬂuid, superﬂuids immediately were con-
sidered as the natural candidates. Superﬂuid helium II
has been the ﬁrst system to be proposed for the inves-
tigation of the Hawking eﬀect [3]. More recently atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates have been considered, as they
may oﬀer a better chance of testing Hawking radiation
[4, 5, 6]. Transonic ﬂows could be also realized in one-
dimensional (1D) systems [5, 7] and available 1D quan-
tum systems, including ultra-cold atoms in optical po-
tentials and wave-guides [10], could be adapted to model
a sonic black hole analogue and to investigate the elusive
Hawking eﬀect.

The Hawking eﬀect has not been considered so far in
systems of non-interacting fermions.
It is the aim of
this Letter to show that indeed a 1D Fermi-degenerate
non-interacting gas that scatters against a very smooth

potential barrier provides a clear and straightforward
quantum mechanical microscopic description of Hawk-
ing radiation. Sonic Hawking radiation is formed due
to quantum tunnelling through the top of the potential
barrier. Particle-hole excitations are created at the bar-
rier and are then radiated with a momentum distribution
characterized by a temperature in exact agreement with
Hawking-Unruh’s formula [1, 2, 4]. Although the evolu-
tion of the ﬂuid’s ﬂow is unitary, when the momentum
distribution is measured locally, for instance through the
measurement of the dynamic structure factor, it is not
distinguishable from a thermal (and incoherent) distri-
bution. The general case of 1D quantum ﬂuids as well as
the possible relevance for experiments is also discussed.
Part I. Microscopic description. — Consider a Fermi-
degenerate gas of particles moving in a suﬃciently nar-
row and smooth constriction such that their motion can
be considered 1D. Their stationary single-particle wave-
functions can be written in the adiabatic approxima-
tion [11] as Ψ(x, y, z) = ψ(x)ξ0;x(y, z) where ξ0;x(y, z) is
the transverse ground-state wave-function with eigenen-
ergy ǫ0(x). ψ(x) satisﬁes a 1D Schr¨odinger equation
x + Vext(x)]ψ(x) = ǫψ(x) where Vext is an ef-
[
−
fective potential that includes also the zero point energy
ǫ0(x) [12].
I assume Vext very smooth and essentially
non-zero only near its maximum Vmax located at x = 0.
Consider a ﬂow of particles coming from the left and
colliding against the potential Vext. Their particle’s wave-
functions are given by scattering wave functions asymp-
totically deﬁned by ψǫ ∝
x) +
t(ǫ)eikxΘ(x), where ǫ = ~2k2/2m is the energy eigenvalue
and r(ǫ) and t(ǫ) are the reﬂection and transmission am-
plitudes, respectively. The evolution of the particle ﬂow
is unitary and the many-body wave function of the ﬂow
of particles is represented in a second quantization by

a ﬂuid turning supersonic (see below) where the micro-

a ﬁrst approximation the sharp Fermi-degenerate char-
acter of the local momentum (or velocity) distribution,
which represents the “Vacuum” of the black hole sonic
analogue. This allows us to describe the ﬂuid dynamic
with the standard hydrodynamic equations. The veloci-
ties of the particles in the ﬂuid are uniformly distributed
within an interval (vL, vR). Figure 1 shows an example
of velocity distribution. The right Fermi velocity vR =
2Vext(x)/m is the velocity of a particle mov-
ing from the left to the right with initial velocity higher
p
than the classical threshold velocity to go over the bar-
rier vesc =
2Vmax/m. The left Fermi velocity vL is the
velocity of a particle starting from the top of the barrier
(located at x = 0), i.e. vL = sgn(x)
2Vext(x)/m.
The sgn(x) function accounts for the two possible diﬀer-
ent signs of the velocity that the particle can have falling
either to the right or left of the barrier.

FIG. 1: Semi classical velocity distribution as function of
the coordinate x. Velocities are uniformly distributed in the
area limited by vR (top solid line) and vL (bottom solid
line). Thinner solid lines correspond to diﬀerent classical
orbits of the particles of the ﬂuid. Here ǫmax = 2.5 and
Vext = exp(−x2) in dimensionless units. The inset shows
the Mach number v/c as function of position x.

The ﬂow velocity v = (vL + vR)/2 is the velocity of
a local reference frame from where the ﬂuid appears
in equilibrium.
Introducing the Fermi velocity vF =
(
vL + vR)/2 as the Fermi velocity in the co-moving
−
frame, the density is given by n = mvF /π~. With these
deﬁnitions the current Ω = nv = mvvF /π~ is conserved
[13]. The Bernoulli equation v2/2 + h + Vext/m = cost
where h(n) = π2~2n2/2m2 is the enthalpy (the Fermi en-
ergy divided by the particle mass) is satisﬁed with cost =

is consistently given by the Fermi velocity c = vF . It is
easy to verify that the above deﬁned particles ﬂow is a
transonic ﬂow, namely subsonic on the left of the barrier
and supersonic on the right. The inset of Figure 1 shows
the behaviour of the Mach number v/c in the 1D channel.
Even if the potential barrier is very smooth, its ﬁnite
thickness near its top smears the semi classical Fermi
distributions at vL(x). This is due to those particles col-
liding against the barrier with energies comparable with
Vmax. The reﬂection probability is given by (see also [14])

of S(q, ω) in the subsonic (left) and supersonic (right) re-

The experimental observation of the widths of these
peaks would provide a measure of Hawking tempera-
ture. Degenerate Fermi atoms have been only recently
obtained [8]. Lithium can have a degeneracy tempera-
ture as high as 8 µK, which ﬁxes the scale of ǫmax. A
reservoir of degenerate Lithium could be connected to
non trapped states with a 1D channel realized by optical
potentials or wave-guides [9]. The barrier potential could
be created by a far-blue-detuned laser sheet propagating
in a direction orthogonal to that of the ﬂow propagation
and tightly focused with a waist (1/e2) of twice the laser
wavelength (760 nm). Hawking temperature would be of
200 nK and the characteristic wavelength
order of TH ∼
of Hawking radiation λc of order of 40 µm.

The dynamic structure factor S(q, ω) in the subsonic
region is equivalent to that of a 1D channel connecting
two reservoirs at temperatures T = 0 on the left and
T = TH on the right. This is the analogue of Hawking
radiation from a black hole into the surrounding zero-
temperature space. To distinguish between this pure
quantum state and a mixed thermal state it would re-
quire the measurement of correlations such as for instance
those between opposite sides of the barrier. Correlated
pairs of quasi-particles (particle-hole), the “real” parti-
cles in an eﬀective low-energy description, are created at
the barrier and evolve in opposite directions.

The interpretation of the Hawking radiation as related
to a tunnel eﬀect is in agreement with a recent derivation
of the Hawking radiation as a tunnelling process of parti-
cles in a dynamical geometry due to Parikh and Wilczek
[17]. A relationship with a generalized form of diﬀraction
has been pointed out by Sanchez [19]. Moreover electric
pair production in a strong static electric ﬁeld is related
to a similar tunnelling through an inverted harmonic os-
cillator [18]. As quantum tunnelling is very sensitive to
the details of the potential barrier, the distribution of ra-
diated quasi-particles, related to the reﬂection coeﬃcient
of the barrier, can be diﬀerent from (2).
In particular
this suggest the possibility that some information on the
supersonic part of the ﬂuid (the analogue of the classi-
cal forbidden region of a black hole) is carried by the
radiation.

Part II. 1D quantum ﬂuids. — Hawking’s predic-
tion is,
in principle, valid also for strongly correlated
1D systems, such as the Tonks and Lieb-Liniger gases
[20], which are currently subject of intense interest [10]
and electrons in clean short quantum wires [11, 22]. Us-
ing standard hydrodynamics of 1D ﬂow, it is possible to

4

rewrite Hawking temperature (3) in a more general form
[21] as TH = η ~ωx/2πkB where η is deﬁned by

In general η is only weakly dependent on the form of the
function enthalpy h(n) and Hawking temperature is ba-
sically proportional to a quantity that is related to the
propagation of a single particle of the ﬂuid in the vicinity
of the horizon. In the case of a non-interacting degener-
ate 1D Fermi gas considered here, η is equal to 1 since the
enthalpy is proportional to the square of the density. In
the case of a 1D Bose gas, η is equal to
3/4 in the mean-
ﬁeld regime [7] since the enthalpy is linear in the density
and is equal to 1 in the Tonks-Girardeau limit [20] since
the enthalpy is identical to that of a Fermi-degenerate
gas in that limit. Beside the importance of testing some
aspects of black hole evaporation, sonic Hawking radia-
tion would be a remarkable transport phenomena in these
strongly correlated quantum ﬂuids and could be used to
investigate their properties.

p

A quite diﬀerent 1D system where one may consider
to experimentally realize a sonic black hole and to test
Hawking radiation would be a system of charge parti-
cles, like electrons in quantum wires or ions in elongated
traps. The long-range part of the Coulomb interaction
could substantially renormalize the Hawking tempera-
ture in long wires in a way similar to how it does for
the scattering from an impurity [22].

Conclusion — A Fermi-degenerate ﬂow of particles
propagating in a 1D channel in the presence of a smooth
eﬀective barrier provides an exact solvable quantum me-
chanical model for the sonic analogue of Hawking radi-
ation. The agreement with Hawking’s calculation is ob-
tained in the limit of a very smooth barrier, which is the
equivalent in Hawking’s derivation to a slowly evolving
event horizon. The thermal and incoherent characteristic
of Hawking radiation is discussed in terms of a measur-
able quantity such as the dynamic structure factor.

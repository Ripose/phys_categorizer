Light scalar ﬁelds very naturally appear in modern cosmological models, aﬀecting such parameters
of Standard Model as electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant α, dimensionless ratios of electron or
quark mass to the QCD scale , me,q/ΛQCD. Cosmological variations of these scalar ﬁelds should
occur because of drastic changes of matter composition in Universe: the latest such event is rather
recent (redshift z ∼ 0.5), from matter to dark energy domination. In a two-brane model (we use as
a pedagogical example) these modiﬁcations are due to changing distance to “the second brane”, a
massive companion of “our brane”. Back from extra dimensions, massive bodies (stars or galaxies)
can also aﬀect physical constants. They have large scalar charge Qd proportional to number of
particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar ﬁeld φ = Qd/r. This leads to a variation of the
fundamental constants proportional to the gravitational potential, e.g. δα/α = kαδ(GM/rc2). We

compare diﬀerent manifestations of this eﬀect. The strongest limits kα + 0.17ke = (−3.5 ± 6) ∗ 10
are obtained from the measurements of dependence of atomic frequencies on the distance from Sun
(the distance varies due to the ellipticity of the Earth’s orbit).

INTRODUCTION

Changing parameters of the standard model are usu-
ally associated with the eﬀect of massless (strictly speak-
ing, very light) scalar ﬁelds. One candidate, much dis-
cussed in literature, is the so called dilaton: a very spe-
cial scalar which appears in string models together with
a graviton, in a massless multiplet of closed string exci-
tations. Other scalars naturally appear in string-theory-
inspired cosmological models, in which our Universe is
a “brane” ﬂoating in a space of larger dimensions. The
scalars are simply brane coordinates in extra dimensions.
At the other hand, available observational limits on
physical constant variations at present time are quite
strict, allowing only scalar coupling tiny in comparison
with gravity. The only relevant scalar ﬁeld recently dis-
covered – the cosmological dark energy – also so far does
not show visible variations. So one may wander why
should one discuss time or space-depending physics at
all?

One motivation was provided by Damour et al [1, 2]
who pointed out that cosmological evolution of scalars
naturally leads to their self-decoupling. Damour and
Polyakov have further suggested that variations should
happen when the scalars get excited by some physical
change in the Universe, such as the phase transitions or
other drastic change in the Equation of State (EoS) of
the Universe. They considered few of them, but since
the time of their paper a new fascinating EoS transition
has been discovered: from matter dominated (decelerat-
ing) era to dark energy dominated (accelerating) era. It
is relatively recent event, corresponding to cosmological
redshift z

0.5.

The time dependence of the disturbance related to it

can be calculated, and it turned out [4, 5] that the self-
decoupling process is eﬀective enough to explain why af-
ter this transition the variation of constants is as small as
observed in laboratory experiments at the present time,
2 billion years ago or z = 0.14) and
as well as at Oklo (
isotopes ratios in meteorites ( 4.6 billion years to now,
z = 0.45

with possible observations [7, 8] of the variations of the
electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant at z

In this paper we discuss why and how such excitation
works in some modern cosmological models at the same
cosmological time of this transition. Another vast area
we will address here is similar variations of constants in
space, near massive bodies such as stars (Sun), pulsars,
Galaxy. We will compare possible sensitivities related
with diﬀerent possible objects, point out limitations fol-
lowing from some recent experiments with atomic clocks
and suggest new measurements.

Although both authors are neither cosmologists nor
string theorists, we selected two-brane model as our main
example, for pedagogical reasons. Variations of physical
constants with distance to Sun and in cosmological time
have a similar nature: in both cases it is the interaction
with a massive body (Sun or heavy “second brane”, re-
spectively) via scalar ﬁelds. We hope it will be helpful to
get the message across for a non-specialized reader.

II. WHICH SCALARS?

A. The dilaton and its coupling functions

Large distance interactions in Universe are dominated
by gravity, which cannot be screened and get cumula-

tive eﬀects from large bodies. Einstein’s description –
general relativity – uses spin-2 metric tensor gµν cou-
pled to energy-momentum tensor T µν
δSm/δgµν of all
matter. Thinking about large distance modiﬁcation of
gravity, people for a long time asked why not also add
a massless (or very light) spin-0 scalar ﬁeld in a similar
way.

∼

The question is what is their nature and how are they
are coupled to matter. One choice (originating from lit-
erature on general relativity tests) is to work in the so
called “Einstein frame” and keep gravitational part of
the action in the usual form, while adding a scalar ﬁeld
in all other terms via a “coupling function” A(φ) in the
metric

˜gµν = A2(φ)gE
µν

where gE is the usual “Einsteinian” metric.

containing the trace of total matter energy-momentum
tensor T = T µ
µ . This operator T has a special meaning
in physics, being a generator of the so called dilatational
transformation – a change of units of all ﬁelds. That is
why a ﬁeld coupled to it is called a dilaton ﬁeld.

it
Thus this ﬁeld can be seen as a scale parameter:
plays the same role as e.g. a rotation angles ~n for the
rotation operator exp(i~n ~J) (where ~J is angular momen-
tum operator), or coordinate ~x in displacement operator
exp(i~x ~P ) (where ~P is momentum). So, if φ(x)
= φ(y)
at two points x, y it means that clocks and meters made
of matter ﬁelds (such as atoms or nuclei) are rescaled
diﬀerently there. Note that this statement makes sense
only because the purely geometrical Einsteinian metric
gE of space-time itself was ﬁxed independently of φ(x),
and gravitational meters - e.g. the Schwarzschield radius
of a black hole – are not changed.

−

This ﬁeld φ described so far is interacting with the
3P of matter (here P is the pressure).
total T = ρ
Note that it is enough to violate the equivalence principle:
it is say coupled to “dust” P = 0 in the same way as
gravity, to the mass, but not to a bag ﬁlled by black-body
radiation ρ = 3P . Furthermore, the energy-momentum
tensor trace can be expressed in terms of fundamental
gauge and fermionic ﬁelds

weak and strong interactions (i = 1, 2, 3 in the ﬁrst sum)

stant, with βi ≈ −

proton or nuclei include say the electromagnetic part pro-
portional to ~E2 + ~B2 while the operator above contains
scalar combination ~E2

However, even the string-theory dilaton is only sim-
ple at high string scale, where supersymmetries hold to-
gether massless supermultiplet which includes both the
spin-2 graviton and spin-0 dilaton, together with a bunch
of other spin 3/2,1,1/2,0 ﬁelds. By the time one goes
down to the scale at which we discuss Standard Model
of particle physics these symmetries should be broken by
complicated dynamical phenomena nobody understands.
This may lead to a dilaton mass, and renormalize its in-
teraction with diﬀerent kind of matter diﬀerently.

In desperation, one may thus start from the opposite
extreme: assume diﬀerent coupling functions Ai(φ).

one can still get rid of some of them by rescaling all the
matter ﬁeld (we already discussed removing scalar from

because we have already ﬁxed Aµ at the previous step.
The lesson is this: φ dependent “coupling functions” can
be delegated into the gauge ﬁeld coupling constants, as
Bekenstein [3] did for QED (and extensively used in dis-
cussions of the variations such as [4, 5]).

A number of authors [14] (see also review[15]) sug-
gested variations of em,weak and strong couplings should
be related provided the variation comes from the high
energy (right in Fig.1) end. The strong (i=3), and
electroweak (i=1,2) inverse coupling constants have the

Fig.1 shows two popular scenarios of Grand Uniﬁca-
tion: with the standard model as well as for its minimal
supersymmetric extension (MSSM). In the latter case one
can see that 3 curves cross at one point, believed to be a
“root” of the three branches (electromagnetic, weak and
strong). One may select the uniﬁcation point for µ0, and
for example, µ = mZ is the Z-boson mass.

( String theories lead to more complicated “trees”,
which however also have a singly “root”, at a string scale
Λs and bare string coupling gs.)

(SU (5) normalized, as the dashed line), α2 (dotted line) and

close to the top quark mass.

So, what happens when one subject the theory to a
nonzero value of the scalar ﬁeld (dilaton)? A number of
authors [14] (see also review[15]) suggested variations of
em,weak and strong couplings should be related provided
the variation comes from the high energy end. There
is quite extended discussion of what may happen, but
basically there are two possibilities.

as the whole MSSM “tree” (Fig.1) moves up or down.
If so, the variation of the strong interaction constant
α3(mz) is much larger than the variation of the em con-
stant α, δα3/α3 = (α3/α1)δα1/α1.

Another option is the variation of the GUT scale (µ/µ0
in eqn (6).
If so the whole “tree” at Fig.1 moves left-
right and quite diﬀerent relations between variations of
the three coupling follows

δα

2 /b2 = δα

−1
3 /b3

(8)

Note that now variations have diﬀerent sign since the one
loop coeﬃcients bi have diﬀerent sign for 1 and 2,3.

However, it is hard to see how this relation appears
dynamically, at least in cosmological models on the mar-
ket. One would rather think the inﬂuence of the “cou-
pling functions” depending on scalars in the matter terms
of the Lagrangian would actually mean “curving” of the
lines of the “tree” at Fig.1. Another unclear issue is the

modiﬁcation of lepton/quark masses, which are propor-
tional to Higgs VEV and thus depend on the mechanism
of electroweak symmetry breaking.

B.

Introducing cosmological two-brane model

It would be premature at this moment to subscribe to
any model, of course. However we still ﬁnd some of them
more dynamically natural and possibly useful, at least
pedagogically, to explain our intuitive ideas in relating
distinct physics together. Field and string theory provide
examples of topological objects of diﬀerent dimensions –
branes – on which eﬀective fermionic, gauge and scalar
ﬁelds live. One of them may be our 4-d Universe with our
Standard model ﬁelds, ﬂoating in a larger-dimensional
space[30].

It inspired many speciﬁc cosmological models provid-
ing some dynamical realizations of Brane World Cosmol-
ogy (see e.g. [12, 13] for reviews). More speciﬁcally, our
pedagogical point is best served by the two-brane models,
in which our 3-d brane (coordinates ~x) is complemented
by another 3-d brane, parallel to it but shifted in the 5-th
dimension (we will call y). The Big Bang in this model is
thus supplemented not only by the inﬂuence of the “bulk
ﬁelds” living on and in between branes (gravitons and
dilatons among them) but also by the second brane.

Without matter, symmetries of the model naturally
balance all forces between the branes – gravity and
scalar attraction is balanced by Coulomb-like vector
repulsion[31].
It means that in this approximation the
positions of two branes y1, y2 are irrelevant: branes can
“levitate” in presence of each other, anywhere they chose.
With extra matter added to branes this symmetry is bro-
ken and branes start their motion (making yi a function
of time t).
If matter is not homogeneous, as shown in
Fig.2 for the left brane, the brane bends, making it a
function of 3-space point yi(~x). In general, there appear
4-d scalar ﬁeld yi(~x, t), describing the shape of the mov-
ing brane.

Unlike models mentioned above, nothing unusual hap-
pens with physics at high energy (right) part of Fig.1:
all changes are restricted to low energy (left) end. Since
gauge bosons are generated dynamically – by open strings
with both ends on our brane – one can calculate how
much this aﬀect their eﬀective Lagrangian and in princi-
ple predict how they are aﬀected by the relative dilaton
ﬁeld, or y1, y2 scalars.

These two branes were originally introduced by Ran-
dall and Sundrum [6] to explain why gravity can be
strong in general but exponentially weak at our brane[32]
due to warping of the space-time by gravity of the com-
panion brane.

(Another fascinating aspect of the two-brane model
which we will not discuss at all is a possibility to explain
the dark matter phenomenon by ascribing it to the other
brane.)

which can be seen as an oscillator with exciting force
(r.h.s) and the damping (the second term in the l.h.s.)
If its evolution can be
containing the EoS ratio P/ρ.
put in as a function of time τ , this can be treated as an
independent eqn.

For radiation-dominated Universe the r.h.s. (“excita-
tion force”) is zero (ρ = 3P ), while l.h.s. corresponds
to damped oscillator which rapidly relaxes to rest. For
other single-component eras the r.h.s. is not zero, but is
dominated by a single value of P/ρ (e.g. zero for matter-
dominated one) and a single function A(φ): the evolu-
tion is a relaxation toward the minimum of this function,
which say happens at some φ = φm. At the minimum A′
is zero and all interaction of the small-amplitude dilaton
with matter vanishes.

The only time when this argument does not work is
when EoS of the Universe is changing. In a simplest case,
there are two comparable contributions of two types of
matter. In particular, let us focus directly at the latest
cosmological event of this change in which components
of the energy-momentum tensor have comparable con-
tributions of matter (luminous and dark) and the dark
energy (cosmological constant). A single equation for φ
(12) is no longer valid and one should solve all coupled
equations (given above) together. One may ﬁnd explicit
solutions e.g.
in [4, 5], but it is easy to guess what is
happening without numerical solutions: a damped oscil-
lator slides from one equilibrium position (the minimum
of coupling function to matter at φ = φm) to a new min-
imum of another coupling function to the dark energy at
φ = φd. This slide is dominated by strong damping of
cosmic oscillator, which is universal. As a result, one is
able to predict the time dependence of the cosmological
scalar ﬁeld (if not the magnitude itself.). In summary:
the mechanism leads to a ladder-type evolution pattern
of the scalar ﬁeld.

As shown in [4, 5], the last slide is such that there is ac-
tually no contradiction between limits from Oklo and me-
teorite isotope compositions with nonzero claim in quasar
spectra [7, 8].

There is another version of scalar motion, in which
people want it to slide not toward a constant value now
(usually taken to be zero) but to inﬁnity, reproducing
the so called “tracking” solutions. In other words, these
authors want to hit two birds with one stone and to solve
the “dark energy” puzzle by the same scalar. If so, the
rolling ﬁeld cannot do it suﬃciently quickly, and in this
case the meteorite-based limits and quasar data cannot
be reconciled [18].

As we will discuss in the next section, however, there
is no shortage of scalar ﬁelds in modern models, and it
is quite natural that diﬀerent ﬁelds would be responsible
for these two phenomena.

FIG. 2: Schematic picture of 2-brane construction. The co-
ordinates inside two parallel branes are called ~x and the one
normal to them y. A massive body (shaded circle) on a brane
can cause its deformation, as shown, due to extra attraction
to the second brane.

in the r.h.s.). It is also useful to introduce “logarithmic

tive over it by a prime[34]. The following single eqn for

B. Cosmic evolution of scalars in two-brane
cosmology

The three scalars of the model are the bulk dilaton and
2 brane shapes y1(~x, t), y2(~x, t) as shown in Fig. 2 : their
combinations are two scalars to appear in the Lagrangian.
The supersymmetric potential ensures “levitation” and
deﬁnes the basic low energy Lagrangian. The parame-
ters of the model include tensions (masses per area) of
two branes and bulk cosmological constant, to be tuned
as explained in [6] for static construction. To make it
dynamically moving, there is additional model potential
expressing the brane tension as a function of bulk dila-
ton scalar which is arbitrarily selected to be exponen-
exp(αdφ). As it turns out, the parameter αd
tial U
is restricted from above by cosmological limitations on
the variations of the gravitational constant and electro-
magnetic ﬁne structure constant [11]. In simple terms,
it means that the two branes should be suﬃciently far
apart, not to cause too much disturbance in our world.

∼

As it stands, the factors depending on scalars appear
in the action in front of the Einstein-Hilbert R term.
In the language of relativity practitioners it would be

called “Jordan frame”, which is deposited by a conformal
transformation of the metric to the so called “Einstein
frame” in which there are no scalars in front of the R
term any more, with the cost of getting them in matter
Lagrangian instead. The corresponding total low energy
eﬀective action of this model becomes of the form

and in the model with exponential potential they have a
particular form, depending on the parameter αd of the
model. These functions describe mutual attraction of the
two branes, and thus the distance between them.

In Fig.3(a) one ﬁnds cosmic evolution of matter com-
position of this model, which is tuned to reproduce du-
rations of radiation, matter and scalar-dominated eras.
Fig.3(b) shows the corresponding motion of the two
branes. As one should expect from discussion in the
preceding section, one ﬁnds some sliding behavior, from
equilibrium at radiation dominated era to a gentle slide
during matter era to another change recently (related to
scalar dominance and accelerated Universe, as now ob-
served.

The main lesson from this is that the two-brane model
leads to nearly the same cosmological eqns as people were
discussing on more general grounds for ad hoc scalars.
Therefore, the ideas about cosmological attractor lead-
ing to self decoupling of the scalars work. In particular,
in radiation-dominated era there is no “force” term in the
r.h.s. as ρ = 3P and rolling to the minimum kills evolu-
tion fast. Matter dominated period start changes in the
scalars again, as well as recent transition from matter to
cosmological constant dominance.

An ideal model would (i) produce the potential at the
current minimum equal to the observed cosmological con-
stant; (ii) make relaxation to it so good that all current
and recent (Oklo, meteorites) strong limits on any modiﬁ-
cations of the constants be naturally satisﬁed; and maybe
(iii) produce interesting modiﬁcations at redshift z
1
where the matter composition at our brane had changed
the last time.

∼

A particular potentials studied in [10] numerically have
not achieved these goals (and in fact the authors found
some unexpected theoretical problems on the way). But
the game is too recent to give up on it, and the settings
itself is clearly suﬃciently ﬂexible to try many variants.

IV. CHANGING PHYSICS NEAR MASSIVE
BODIES

The reason gravity is so important at large scales is
that its eﬀect is additive. The same should be true for
massless (or very light) scalars: its eﬀect near large body
is proportional to the number of particles in it.

Unlike in the brane models, in which one can only hope
to feel motion of the second brane via constant variations,
we do see the Sun. But suppose we cannot (e.g. there are
always clouds) and the temperature is also unchanged.
Can one still feel that the Sun gets closer or further, in
a periodic fashion? By an oscillating physical constants,
perhaps.

A. Scalars coupled to gravity in static case

For static star (or Galaxy) the eqn for the dilaton is

′
∆φ = 4πGA

(φ)T

(21)

to be of course complimented by Einstein’s eqn to which
it is coupled

Rµν = 2∂µφ∂ν φ + 8πG(Tµν −

(T /2)gµν)

(22)

It is a nonlinear eqn inside the body, which as usual for
stars should be solved starting from r=0 outward. But
what one should expect to ﬁnd for dilaton outside the
body?

If there is no matter there, T = 0 at r > R, then the
only possibility is simply a combination of a Coulomb-like
ﬁeld and constant

φ = Qd/r + φ0

(23)

Constant part is the cosmological dilaton expectation
value we discussed above: the Coulomb-like ﬁeld 1/r is
the subject of this section.

But before we discuss it, let us think what would hap-
pen at constant density, say if one wish to include some
matter such as interstellar gas or cosmological constant,
which produces small but nonzero T everywhere? If one
writes A′(φ) = βφ the r.h.s.
is then a mass term with
the dilaton mass

m2

d = 4πGβT

(24)

If T is given by the cosmological constant this mass be-
d = 6βΩcH 2 where Ωc = 0.7 is its current bal-
comes m2
ance in total density and H is current Hubble constant.
Ignoring factors of the order one one ﬁnds that this mass
is only important for sizes as large as the visible Universe
itself. Thus, the ﬁrst lesson thing we learned from this
is that the sign of β should be such that there is no in-
stability present in the Universe: we have to be near the
minimum, not maximum of the potential.

The other lesson is that for any body the eﬀective dila-
ton mass can only gets important if its size is close to
its own relativistic radius. It is indeed precisely in this
case, for which Damour and Esposito-Farese [21] argued
that large dilaton-induced eﬀect is possible inside neu-
tron stars, provided the coupling β happen to be spe-
cially tuned to the star parameters making it into a kind
or resonator amplifying small cosmological dilaton ﬁeld
outside.

In fact we know for sure that outside neutron stars
the dilaton ﬁeld is small. It was shown in multiple works
(see refs e.g. in [21]) that the absence of scalar-induced
corrections for binary pulsar motion can get signiﬁcant
limits on that, although they are still somewhat weaker
than the limit A′ < 10−3 following from solar system
experiments related to post-Newtonian gravity eﬀects.

However impressive is the accuracy of the available
data on motion of some binary pulsars, we think that

potentially spectroscopic studies of scalar-induced modi-
ﬁcation of physics constants is a more promising way to
go for future studies, as accuracy of spectral line frequen-
cies is still much higher.

For not-too-relativistic objects, like the usual stars or
planets, both their total mass M and the total dilaton
charge Q are simply proportional to the number of nu-
cleons in them, and thus the dilaton ﬁeld is simply pro-
portional to the gravitational potential

φ0 = κ(GM/rc2)

φ

(25)

and thus we expect that the fundamental constants would
also depend on the position via the gravitational poten-
tial at the the measurement point.

B. Comparison between potential and real
experiments

Naively, one may think that the larger is the dimen-
sionless gravity potential (GM/rc2) of the object con-
sidered, the better. However, diﬀerent objects allow for
quite diﬀerent accuracy.

Let us mention few possibilities, using as a comparison
parameter the product of gravity potential divided by the
tentative relative accuracy

P = (GM/rc2)/(accuracy)

Accuracy of the atomic clocks is so high because they
use extremely narrow lines. At this stage, therefore, star
spectroscopy seem not to be competitive: the situation
may change if narrow lines be identiﬁed.

Now let us see what is the best limit available today.
As an example we consider recent work [19] who obtained
the following value for the half-year variation of the fre-
quency ratio of two atomic clocks: (i) optical transitions
in mercury ions 199Hg+ and (ii) hyperﬁne splitting in
133Cs (the frequency standard). The limit obtained is

[30] Note the similarity with expanding the view from the 2-
d Earth surface, our natural habitat, to 4d Einsteinian
Universe. The diﬀerence is: we can see stars and galaxies,
but we dont know anything deﬁnite about these extra
dimensions yet.

[31] There are also some other stability conditions we dont

mention, see [6, 13].

[32] our brane one may call “the brane Earth” and the
other “the brane Sun”, to enhance analogy to Coper-
nicus/Kepler system of the world. It also explains which
one has the dominant mass.

[33] Note that simple additivity of contributions to energy-
momentum tensor is ambiguous for non-gravitationally
interacting species, but we dont expect it to be a problem
for the case we aimed at, in which one component is
baryonic/dark matter and the other the dark energy.

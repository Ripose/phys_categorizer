Abstract

Radiative corrections to the 2E1 decay width of the 2s1/2-state in
the low-Z hydrogen-like system are examined within logarithmic ap-
proximation. The correction is found to be 2.025(1) α(Zα)2 /π log(Zα)2
in units of the non-relativistic rate.

A leading radiative correction to the E1 one-photon decay
width of the hydrogenic levels was analyzed recently by the au-
thors in Refs. [1, 2]. The correction has order of α(Zα)2 log(Zα)
in relative units. This work is devoted to the leading radiative
correction to the 2E1 two-photon decay of the metastable 2s1/2
state in hydrogen-like atoms, which has the same relative order
of the magnitude.

The rate of the 2s metastable state decay in the hydrogen
atom was ﬁrst examined in Ref. [3] and the investigations were
developed in a number of works (see Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7] etc). The
decay of the level in the atom with one Schr¨odinger electron and
the inﬁnite nuclear mass was determined with a high precision
in Ref. [5]. Calculations on the atom with one Dirac electron
were performed in Ref. [6]. The nuclear mass corrections were
carried out in Ref. [7], where the results of Ref. [8] for the E1 de-
cays were adjusted for the two-photon 2E1 transition. However,
any radiative corrections have not yet been discussed previously.
In this work a calculation is made of the leading radiative cor-
rections of the relative order of α(Zα)2 to the 2E1 two-photon
decay rates in the low-Z hydrogen-like systems within the loga-
rithmic approximation.

The evaluation of the α(Zα)2 log(Zα) correction can be es-
sentially simpliﬁed by using the Yennie gauge [9] for virtual pho-
tons, in which their propagator in the momentum space has the
form

DY

µν(k) =

gµν + 2

.

In this gauge it is enough to take into account only the loga-
rithmic corrections to the energy and the wave functions. Both

As it is well known (see e. g. Ref.

leading to zero result for all, but s states (see for details [10, 1]).
[11]) the two-photons
decay rate of the 2s-state in the non-relativistic approximation
is of the form

where the contributions labeled by the superscripts C, f and d
associate with the corrections to the constant C (eq. (3)), the
function fq(y) (eq. (5)) and the reduced dipole matrix elements
of eq. (4). The results for two ﬁrst terms presented in Table are
easy to compute in the same techniques as the leading contri-
bution of eq. (2).

The calculation of the third term can be carried out with
using analytic expressions for the radiative corrections to dipole
matrix elements in the Coulomb ﬁeld. For the discrete p-state

One can perform the analytic continuation of the corrections
δd1n and δd2n as functions on n to the continuous p-states. The
sum done over all intermediate p-states of the discrete and con-
tinuous parts of the spectrum is evaluated numerically and the
result is summarized in Table.

The inﬂuence of negative-energy states (NES) on forbid-
den magnetic-dipole ns1/2 − (n + 1)s1/2 transitions in alkali-
metal atoms is investigated. We ﬁnd that the NES contri-
butions are signiﬁcant in almost all cases and for rubidium
reduce the transition rate by a factor of 8. We tabulate
magnetic-dipole (M1) transition amplitudes for the alkalis.
Our M1 value for cesium, where accurate measurements are
available, diﬀers from experiment by 16%. We brieﬂy discuss
the feasibility of an experimental test of NES eﬀects.

It is well known (see,

for example, the discussion
in Ref. [1]) that the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian has
no bound state eigenfunctions in the presence of the
electron-electron interaction. The no-pair Hamiltonian
Hn.p. derived from quantum electrodynamics has been
proposed by Brown and Ravenhall [2] for use in relativis-
tic atomic calculations. Although Hn.p. leads to very ac-
curate energies, the omitted eﬀects of electron-positron
pairs can be signiﬁcant for the forbidden magnetic-dipole
(M1) transition amplitudes. The ﬁrst discussion of pair
corrections to the M1 decay rate for the 2 3S1 state
in
in helium was given by Feinberg and Sucher [3]
1971. Later, when new lifetime measurements of the
2 3S1 metastable state of heliumlike ions became avail-
able, more accurate calculations of M1 were performed
by several theoretical groups. Lindroth and Solomon-
son [4] numerically demonstrated the detailed cancella-
tion of one-pair diagrams in the case of heliumlike ar-
gon. The decay rates of the same transitions for heli-
umlike ions with Z = 2
100 were calculated within
relativistic conﬁguration-interaction approach by John-
son, Plante, and Sapirstein [5]. They treated contribu-
tions of NES using second-order many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT). Indelicato [6] considered the eﬀects of
NES for 2 3S1 M1 decay in the multiconﬁguration Dirac-
Fock (MCDF) approach. Recently we studied NES con-
tributions to transition amplitudes in more detail
[7].
In the Pauli approximation, we derived an eﬀective one-
pair operator that explicitly reveals cancellation between
Coulomb and Breit two-body diagrams and, by using it,
found a transition without such cancellation: the neu-
33S1 transition has a very large NES
tral helium 23S1 −
contribution which reduces the M1 rate by a factor of
2.9.

−

There have been no other calculations treating NES
contributions to M1 transitions systematically in multi-

electron systems, except for He- and Be-like transi-
tions [8]. In this letter, we report second-order MBPT
(n + 1)s1/2 tran-
calculations of magnetic-dipole ns1/2 −
sitions in the alkalis including the analysis of one-pair
eﬀects. We have discovered an unusually large NES con-
tribution, which reduces the transition rate by a factor of
8 in Rb, and propose measurements to test NES eﬀects.
The results of our calculations for Cs are compared to a
previous theoretical determination [9] and to experimen-
tal values [10,11]. For the other alkalis, no measurements
exist.

We can argue that forbidden magnetic-dipole ampli-
tudes are the most sensitive among electro-magnetic
transition amplitudes to the accuracy of the relativis-
tic description of an atomic system. As we will demon-
strate, several factors contribute to the result: correlation
eﬀects, spin-orbit interaction, Breit interaction, retarda-
tion eﬀects, and, ﬁnally, the negative-energy contribu-
tions. The relativistic retarded magnetic-dipole matrix
element can be represented as [5] (atomic units are used

We start our consideration by utilizing second-order
MBPT built on the ”frozen-core” Dirac-Hartree-Fock
(DHF) potential. This approximation includes both lead-
ing correlation and NES eﬀects. We consider matrix el-
ements of the magnetic-dipole operator z between two
valence states v and w. For the purposes of this pa-
per, the valence state v represents the ground state or-
bital ns1/2 and the state w represents the ﬁrst excited s

state (n + 1)s1/2. The ﬁrst order value is given by the
matrix element taken between DHF orbitals zwv. The
second-order correction including both Coulomb (gijkl)

pressions, index a runs over core orbitals and n extends
over virtual orbitals. It is important to note that virtual
states include both excited positive and negative-energy
orbitals. Corresponding Feynman diagrams are given in
Fig. 1. We emphasize that in the no-pair approximation
the summation over virtual states would be limited only
to the positive-energy states, i.e.
include only the dia-
grams in the upper panel of Fig. 1. The inclusion of the
Breit interaction in our analysis is crucial, because its
contribution to the matrix element is of the same order
as for the Coulomb interaction. We use a static limit of
the Breit interaction, since the energy of the transverse
photon is determined by the energy diﬀerence of the real
electrons, not by that of the virtual electron. The nu-
merical calculations were performed with a relativistic
B-spline basis set representation [12] obtained in a cavity
of radius 40 atomic units and included 40 positive- and
40 negative-energy wavefunctions for each partial wave.
The results of our calculations are presented in Table I.
Note that the ﬁrst-order Dirac-Hartree values dominate
for lighter atoms and become less signiﬁcant for cesium
and francium. This is due to larger second-order no-pair
contributions. The values of NES contributions (in the
third row) appear to be roughly proportional to Z. In
the case of cesium they constitute only a small fraction
4% which is even smaller for francium 0.6% due to large
no-pair second-order contributions. However, the NES
fraction reaches 19% in potassium. The rubidium case
is the most surprising: there is cancellation of the two
no-pair terms and consequently a strong dependence of
the total value on the negative-energy corrections. Al-
though such cancellation in second order may be coinci-
dental, and more accurate calculations may be necessary,
we conclude that a measurement of the M1 transition in
rubidium could provide an excellent test of the NES con-
tributions.

The large relative contribution of NES for forbidden
magnetic-dipole transitions is caused by several factors.
First, due to unique properties of the M1 operator (2),
the no-pair amplitude is severely suppressed (by a fac-
tor of α2 in the lowest order). Second, the magnetic-
dipole operator (M1)ij in Eq. (1) contains an integral
of large and small components of Dirac wavefunctions.
For positive-energy states the small component is signif-

icantly weaker than the large component (by a factor of
αZ for hydrogen-like ions). For NES, the situation is
In
reversed, and the small component is much larger.
addition, the Pauli approximation expression (2) with
its particular δ-function-like properties is no longer valid
and one obtains much larger values for M1 matrix el-
ements between negative and positive states, than from
positive-positive matrix elements. Finally, the energy de-
nominators of order 2mc2 bring the NES contributions
to the same level as the contribution from the “regular”
positive-energy states. As seen from Table II, NES con-
tributions from the Breit interaction are comparable to
those from the Coulomb diagrams because the Breit op-
erator mixes large and small components.

We note that for Rb, Cs and Fr, correlation eﬀects
are very important leading to contributions larger than
the lowest-order DHF values. The mechanism has been
discussed by Dzuba et al. [9]. In the Pauli approxima-
tion, the M1 matrix element is proportional to the inte-
gral of the product of the large components between the
states involved. In the ﬁrst-order forbidden transitions
(n+1)s1/2 between states with diﬀerent principal
ns1/2 −
quantum numbers, the radial wavefunctions are orthog-
onal and the M1 rate is zero. Although it is not zero
beyond Pauli approximation, it is strongly suppressed.
The situation is quite diﬀerent for p1/2 and p3/2 matrix
elements which are non-zero due to overlapping radial
wavefunctions caused by the spin-orbit interaction. As
a result, the second order contributions dominate due to
such matrix elements connecting core and exciting states.
This correlation eﬀect becomes overwhelming for heavier
elements where spin-orbit coupling is important.

In Table III, we compare our cesium results for the
magnetic-dipole reduced matrix element with calcula-
tions of Dzuba et al. [9] and with measurements from
several experimental groups. The transition amplitude
used in [9] is related to the reduced matrix element ex-
pressed in atomic units as

The result of our work, despite approximate treatment
of correlation eﬀects, is in reasonable agreement (16%)
with the experimental results. Since the negative-energy
eﬀects are marginally smaller than these deviations, it is
not possible to draw deﬁnitive conclusions about NES ef-
fects from available experiments in cesium. The second-
order expression (3) is a leading term of the random-
phase approximation (RPA). The calculations of Dzuba
et al. [9] implicitly included the eﬀect of negative-energy
states due to the reduction of RPA-like diagrams to the
form of a diﬀerential equation. However, their analysis
did not take into account the Breit interaction. Such an

approach misses an important negative-energy contribu-
tion. Indeed, we demonstrate in Table II that the NES
contribution from the Breit interaction is much larger
than that arising from the Coulomb interaction.

The theoretical calculations of the M1 transition am-
plitudes in the alkalis clearly demonstrate the important
role of negative-energy states. We now discuss experi-
mental possibilities to test these contributions. We com-
pare the NES fractional contributions, deﬁned as the ra-
tio of NES to no-pair contributions, in diﬀerent alkali-
metal atoms in Fig. 2. In the light alkalis (Li, Na, K) the
eﬀect is proportional to Z and is maximal for K (19%).
For heavy atoms such as Cs and Fr, it is small because
of large no-pair contributions. Rubidium, in the mid-
dle, has a very large relative eﬀect (65%) and is the most
promising. If measurements in the other alkalis reach the
precision achieved in Cs, then all alkalis except Fr will be
good candidates for testing NES contributions. The ac-
curacy of the calculations, on the other hand, can impose
even more severe restrictions than experiment. The ac-
curacy of our calculations, as seen in the deviation from
the experiment for Cs, is about 16%; it is expected to be
better for lighter elements. More accurate (1%) no-pair
calculations are possible, for example, in the relativistic
single-double approximation [13]. For Li, precise no-pair
conﬁguration-interaction calculations [14] are also possi-
ble with an accuracy much better than 1%.

In conclusion, we have presented the results of the
second-order MBPT calculations for the forbidden M1
transitions in the alkalis. Comparisons with experimen-
tal and theoretical data for cesium have been made. We
have found very large negative-energy state contributions
to the M1 transition amplitudes in the alkalis. The NES
amplitude is dominant in the case of rubidium, which
could provide the best experimental test of negative-
energy contributions in atomic structure.

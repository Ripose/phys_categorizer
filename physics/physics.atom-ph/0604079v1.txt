We report the successful buffer-gas cooling and magnetic trapping of chromium atoms with densities exceed-
ing 1012 atoms per cm3 at a temperature of 350 mK for the trapped sample. The possibilities to extend the
method to buffer gas cool and magnetically trap molecules are discussed. To minimize the most important loss
mechanism in magnetic trapping, molecules with a small spin-spin interaction and a large rotational constant are
preferred. Both the CrH (6Σ+ ground state) and MnH (7Σ+) radicals appear to be suitable systems for future
experiments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The buffer-gas cooling and magnetic trapping of CaH in
1998 constituted the ﬁrst experiment where large samples of
cold neutral molecules were conﬁned by externally applied
electromagnetic ﬁelds [1]. Since then, a number of alterna-
tive methods has been developed to produce and capture cold
molecules, such as Stark deceleration of polar molecules in
a molecular beam and subsequent electric trapping [2], pho-
toassociation of laser-cooled atoms in a magneto-optical trap
[3], and molecule formation by tuning through magnetic Fes-
hbach resonances in an optical dipole trap [4]. Among these
approaches, the thermalization with a cold buffer gas is the
most general cooling method, as it is applicable to virtually
all atomic and molecular species.
It also offers the beneﬁt
of producing very large samples at sub-Kelvin temperatures,
which form a good starting point for further cooling by other
techniques, such as evaporative cooling.

Doyle and co-workers have successfully applied the buffer
gas method [5] to trap atomic chromium and europium [6, 7]
as well as several other atoms [8]. Apart from the above men-
tioned experiments on CaH, they also demonstrated buffer-gas
cooling of VO and PbO [9, 10] molecules. Although highly
successful, buffer gas cooling in combination with magnetic
trapping of neutral species up to now had only been imple-
mented by this one group.

Here we report on our buffer-gas loading experiment,
aiming at the production of large samples of trapped cold
molecules. We have validated the performance of the new sys-
tem by buffer-gas cooling and trapping of atomic chromium
(Cr). Cr was chosen as it has a large magnetic moment of 6
µB and strong, well-characterized electronic transitions suit-
able for detection using absorption spectroscopy. Moreover,
the most abundant isotope 52Cr (86 %) has zero nuclear spin,
which considerably simpliﬁes the spectrum. As mentioned
above, Cr was also one of the ﬁrst atoms to be magnetically
trapped using buffer-gas cooling by Doyle and co-workers,
and it has been shown that evaporative cooling to quantum de-

generacy is feasible [11]. In our current experiments we trap
Cr atoms and observe holding times exceeding one minute.

In the second part of the paper we describe the criteria we
have used to select the molecules to be studied with this new
experimental setup. We discuss the technological constraints
as well as the relevant intrinsic properties of molecules that
determine the chances of success of buffer-gas cooling exper-
iments in conjunction with magnetic trapping.

II. METHOD AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Buffer-gas cooling of atoms and molecules is done by ther-
malizing them with a cold background gas. Collisions with
the background gas particles take out small quantities of en-
ergy of the particles to be cooled, and after many collisions the
particles are thermalized with the background gas. The choice
of background gas is restricted to those species that have at the
(low) temperature of interest a large enough density to facil-
itate a large number of collisions while not reacting with the
collision partner to form new species. Also, if buffer gas cool-
ing is combined with trapping using external ﬁelds, the buffer
gas should be insensitive to these ﬁelds. In practice, the only
gas that fulﬁlls these conditions is helium.

At the start of experiments, a dense helium vapor is created
in an experimental cell. The buffer gas density is chosen such,
that hot particles injected into it are cooled sufﬁciently to be
trapped by an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld before they can
diffuse to the cell wall and adsorb to it. On the other hand, the
density must be low enough to allow for the particles to reach
the trap center. Optimal buffer gas densities are typically in
the range of 1016-1017 atoms per cm3, which corresponds to
the vapor pressure of 4He at ∼ 700 mK, or 3He at ∼ 300 mK.
After the creation of the required buffer gas density, the
species to be cooled is injected into the cell. This can be
done through capillary injection, or by ablation from a solid
state precursor material placed within that cell.
In another
current project, efforts are made to use a molecular beam to
inject molecules into the buffer-gas [12]. Upon injection into
the cell, the particles collide with the helium atoms in the va-
por. By thermalizing with the helium vapor, species in low-
ﬁeld seeking (LFS) states are drawn into the local magnetic

2

the cryostat and from the four lateral sides there are apertures
for 25 mm diameter windows. To be able to use the four side
windows, there are 10 mm diameter clearances through the
magnet support structure at the height of the trap center.

The experimental cell, made of oxygen-free high conduc-
tivity copper (OFHC), is attached to the mixing chamber of
the dilution refrigerator and positioned in the center of the
magnet bore. The cell is linked to the cryostat by a 10 cm
long copper rod of 15 mm diameter forming a well-deﬁned
thermal impedance. Optical access into the cell is provided
by a 50 mm diameter window sealing the bottom of the cell.
A buffer gas ﬁll line is implemented using a CuNi capillary.
Finally, the cell is equipped with RuO thermistors and a resis-
tive heater for temperature monitoring and control.

In the current experiment, the buffer gas density is created
by bringing the entire cell to the temperature of choice. The
density is limited by the pre-deﬁned amount of helium let into
the cell. Cr atoms are injected via laser-ablation from a solid
chip of Cr, positioned at the top of the cell, using a ∼ 10 ns
duration frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser pulse at 532 nm
with a typical pulse energy of ∼ 15 mJ. We detect Cr atoms
in their mJ = +3 sublevel of the ground state by monitoring
absorption of light resonant with the a7S3(mJ = +3) ←
z7P4(mJ = +4) transition around 425 nm. This is a nearly
closed transition where almost all excited Cr atoms decay into
the initial state (leakage ∼ 10−6). The light is generated by
frequency doubling the output of a grating-stabilized diode
laser (Toptica DL100) at 850 nm in a KNbO3 crystal within
an external bow-tie cavity. The cavity is actively locked to the
diode laser using a Pound-Drever-Hall scheme [14]. On long
timescales the cavity length is adjusted piezo-electrically to
match the laser frequency; on short time scales, the frequency
of the diode laser is adjusted to match the cavity length by
modulating the diode current. It must be stressed that the laser
is not frequency-locked to an external reference, so that long-
term frequency drifts can occur. The frequency-doubled light
is amplitude stabilized by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM),
spatially ﬁltered, expanded and (optionally) sent through an
aperture deﬁning a beam diameter of a few mm.

This beam is then sent into the cell using a beam splitter and
retroreﬂected by a mirror mounted at the top of the cell. To
minimize optical etalon effects, all windows are wedged by ∼
1o and anti-reﬂection (AR) coated for the wavelengths used in
the experiment. For the current experiments only the bottom
windows are implemented. Light exiting the cell is directed
onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT, Electron Tubes 9813QB).
A fraction of the light that is not entering the cryostat is di-
rected onto a second PMT (Electron Tubes 9814QB) for nor-
malization and correction of residual intensity ﬂuctuations.
Typical light powers used are less than 1 µW, to avoid both
heating of the cell and loss of atoms due to optical pumping
effects. The measured transmission is thus obtained by nor-
malizing the detection signal on the reference signal. When
the detection laser is scanned in frequency, the signal is cor-
rected for etalon effects by recording a background transmis-
sion signal on which the signal is normalized. In an alterna-
tive detection scheme, the transmitted beam is directly steered
onto the light-sensitive chip of a CCD camera (PCO Imaging,

perimental cell within the custom-made cryostat, positioned within

ﬁeld minimum; those in high-ﬁeld seeking (HFS) states are
repelled and lost at the cell wall. To fully isolate the trapped
sample, it is necessary to remove the helium, as it forms a
thermal link to the cell wall. This can be done by cooling the
cell down, thereby effectively cryopumping the helium out.

For the cooled species to be magnetically conﬁned, a
(strong) magnetic ﬁeld around the experimental cell, with a
ﬁeld minimum coinciding with the cell center, must be ap-
plied. This can be done using a magnetic quadrupole trap con-
sisting of two parallel coils where counter-propagating cur-
rents create a zero magnetic ﬁeld in the center between the
coils. Typically, the trap depths required for buffer gas cool-
ing should be on the order of a few Kelvin. As the trap depth
E (in units of temperature) is given by E = µH/kb, where µ
is the magnetic moment of the species H the magnetic ﬁeld
magnitude, and kb the Boltzmann constant, this leads to typi-
cal required ﬁeld strengths of ∼ 2 T. These ﬁelds can be gener-
ated by coils of superconducting material, for which a cooling
to liquid helium temperatures is required.

The refrigerator for cooling the experimental cell and the
liquid helium bath that holds the magnet are implemented in a
custom-made cryostat which is schematically depicted in Fig-
ure 1. The cryostat is built around a commercial 3He-4He
dilution refrigerator system (Leiden Cryogenics Minikelvin
126-700), with a speciﬁed cooling power of 500 µW at 120
mK. The magnet consists of two coils of NbTi/Cu wire spun
onto a titanium bobbin that is designed to withstand the repul-
sive forces of the two coils. The magnet design is similar to
the Mark-3 design of Doyle and co-workers [13], but allows
for three axes along which the cell can be optically interro-
gated: one vertical and two horizontal. From the bottom of
the cryostat, three apertures at the different temperature stages
of the cryostat (room temperature, 77 K and 4 K) allow for the
implementation of 75 mm diameter windows. From the top of

in detail below.

The repeated scanning of the laser over the resonance al-
lows the extraction of temperature and density information,
that is contained in the spectral proﬁle, as a function of time.
It can be seen from the inset in Figure 2a that the spectral
shape is broadened in an inhomogeneous fashion. As at tem-
peratures below 1K the expected Doppler broadening is less
than 100 MHz, this shape is predominantly caused by Zee-
man broadening due to the inhomogeneous magnetic trapping
ﬁeld.

To extract information about the density and temperature
of the trapped atom ensemble, we model the system to ob-
tain simulated spectra which can be compared to the recorded
ones. For the modeling, it is assumed that the cloud of atoms
can be characterized by a Boltzmann temperature distribution.
For any given point in the trapping ﬁeld, the Zeeman shifted
transition frequency and a (relative) population density are
calculated. By doing this over a grid spanning the volume that
is deﬁned by the probe beam and integrating over these points
while taking the probe beam intensity proﬁle into account, an
optical density is calculated. This optical density is subse-
quently transformed into a transmission spectrum. The only
free parameters used in this simulation are the particle density
at the trap center and the Boltzmann temperature. From the
inset in Figure 2a it can be seen that the simulated spectrum
is in excellent agreement with the recorded data. A possible
error in the temperatures obtained this way arises from the as-
sumption that the Cr temperature is that of a pure Boltzmann
distribution; however, this truncated Boltzmann approach is
widely used and should not result in large errors [15]. A sec-
ond source of error within the simulation arises from the as-
sumption of a thermal equilibrium. This is certainly not the
case for times shortly after the ablation pulse. Finally, long-
term drifts in the central frequency and of the scan range of
the laser amount to an error of about 4%. We estimate a max-
imum error of ∼ 10%, both for the number density and the
temperature.

The densities and temperatures of the sample as obtained
from the spectral simulations are depicted in the lower two
graphs in Figure 2. In both these graphs, the dynamics men-
tioned above is observed. It can roughly be divided into three
periods which are indicated by I, II and III in Figure 2b.

During period I, the temperature falls rapidly from ∼ 1.5 K
at t=2 s to some 500 mK after 5 s. During the same period,
a strong decay in the Cr atom density near the trap center can
be discerned. These observations are attributed to so-called
spilling effects, where during trap loading the warmest parti-
cles are lost over the trap edge. As a result the overall temper-
ature drops.

The recurrence in the transmission spectrum after 5 s is also
observed in both the temperature and density evolution, and
marks the start of period II. The increase in the density is in-
terpreted in the following way: after the initial large loss due
to ’spillage’, there is now a net diffusion of cold atoms into
the trap center. Still, it can be observed that there is a drop
in the temperature of the trapped sample. As the buffer gas is
still present, it transfers the heat stored in the trapped sample
to the cell wall, which continues to be cooled by the refrigera-

Figure 2a depicts a typical recorded transmission trace
spanning a time period of 1 minute. In this experiment, start-
ing at t=-3.5 s, the cell is heated for a period of 3 s. Then,
at t=0 s, the ablation laser is ﬁred to inject Cr atoms into the
helium vapor. The trace is recorded by repeatedly scanning
the probe laser frequency over a range of ∼ 10 GHz to ob-
tain a magnetic-ﬁeld broadened absorption line while mini-
mizing the effect of long term frequency drifts of the laser
wavelength. In the scanned signal, some interesting dynam-
ics can be observed. In the initial few seconds after ablation,
the strong absorption signal ﬁrst decreases, then shortly grows
again and ﬁnally decays slowly. Additionally, a rapid narrow-
ing of the line proﬁle can be seen during the ﬁrst 5 seconds
following ablation. These different regimes will be discussed

4

speciﬁc ’shells’ within the trapping volume. The results of
these measurements are depicted in Figure 3 for three probe
laser frequencies and three different times at the maximum
trap depth of 6.8 Kelvin. The images shown (1 second gate
time) are obtained as the ratio of an image recorded with Cr
in the trap and one where no Cr is in the system. The size of
the images is 8.6 mm (horizontal axis) by 6.9 mm (vertical).
Since the beam is collimated, the spatial extent of the absorp-
tion signal on the CCD element has a 1:1 correspondence to
the trapped cloud size.

The ﬁrst set of images is recorded at the frequency of
the ﬁeld-free atomic transition. A strong absorption signal
is clearly visible at the trap center. One can immediately
see that the absorption is anisotropic, which is attributed to
the use of linearly polarized probe light. When the probe
laser is tuned towards higher frequencies, a ring structure
becomes apparent in the images. At a frequency-offset of
+1.1 GHz, the strongest absorption is observed in a ring with
a radius of ∼ 1.5 mm. The reason for such a pronounced
ring is that the probe beam line-of-sight here coincides with
a ’shell’ of Cr atoms trapped at the same ﬁeld magnitude.
Again, the asymmetry attributed to the laser polarization is
clearly visible. The ring structure allows for a consistency
check of our trapping ﬁeld calculations.
If we assume that
the probe beam is collimated well, this implies that at a ra-
dius of 1.5 mm the magnetic ﬁeld calculated from the Zee-
man shift ∆ν = HµB(gf mJ,f − gimJ,i)/h is 76 mT. This is
indeed consistent with our trapping ﬁeld calculations, used in
the spectral simulations described earlier.

Apart from this strong outer ring of absorption, some
weaker but still pronounced rings are also visible. The ori-
gin of these rings is unknown to us. It is unlikely that they are
due to population in lower mJ states, as they persist for tens of
seconds and it is expected that population in lower mJ states
is lost more quickly than in the mJ = +3 state due to spin-
exchange collisions. It can be speculated that they are caused
by diffraction of the beam by the dense atomic cloud in the
trap center. It is, however, unfortunately not straightforward
to simulate this diffraction pattern due to our probe geometry
where the probe beam passes the trapped cloud twice.

To investigate the potential of this system for future exper-
iments on the buffer gas cooling and trapping of molecular
species, it is of interest to evaluate the trapping efﬁciencies
at lower trap depths. Such a measurement is performed by
lowering the current through the two anti-Helmholtz coils.
The results of these tests are depicted in Figure 4 where the
observed number densities and temperatures of a trapped Cr
cloud, evaluated at three different times, are shown as a func-
tion of trap depth. Each value is obtained by averaging over
several measurements. The trends that can be seen from these
graphs are clear: a lower trap depth leads to a substantial drop
in the number of captured atoms. The atoms that are suc-
cessfully captured at lower trap depths have a lower temper-
ature. Both trends are qualitatively understood: A shallower
trap captures less particles; at the same time, the hotter parti-
cles are less effectively trapped, and the evaporative cooling
equilibrates at a lower temperature. It is obvious from this
Figure that if a molecule were to be trapped, it should possess

tor. After ∼ 20 s, the temperature of the cell wall (not shown)
has dropped to below 300 mK. The helium that is in the gas
phase within the cell is now cryopumped to the cell wall and
as a consequence the sample is now thermally isolated. Nev-
ertheless, it is seen that the temperature of the trapped cloud is
decreasing further. The only mechanism that can be responsi-
ble for this is evaporative cooling.

After approximately 30 s, the temperature stabilizes to ∼
350 mK. At this time, an equilibrium exists where the loss of
hot atoms no longer lowers the temperature of the remaining
sample. This implies that elastic scattering is now no longer
a source of trap loss. Still, a clear loss of Cr is observed.
This trap loss can have several causes: spin-exchange colli-
sions and dipolar relaxation are collision processes involving
two Cr atoms, whereas molecule formation due to Cr-Cr col-
lisions requires a third partner to carry off excess energy. Of
course, losses due to collisions with background gas are also
possible, although we expect no serious inﬂuence of that due
to our cryogenic vacuum at T < 200 mK. The dominant loss
mechanism may be found by ﬁtting functional forms to the
number density evolution. In a set of data recorded over 180 s
(not shown here) a clear signature of two-body loss processes
is found. We infer from this that the dominant loss mecha-
nism is that of dipolar relaxation, consistent with observations
made in earlier magnetic trapping experiments on Cr [16].

In the measurements presented above, the probe laser diam-
eter is limited to ∼ 3 mm and is aligned through the trap cen-
ter. This way not the whole trapping volume is addressed. In
an alternative experimental conﬁguration, the full waist of the
collimated probe beam is sent through the trap center, retrore-
ﬂected and steered directly onto the light-sensitive element of
a CCD camera. For these imaging experiments the laser fre-
quency is kept at a ﬁxed value. Since the atomic resonance
frequency is determined by the ﬁeld-dependent Zeeman shift,
a ﬁxed frequency experiment selectively probes for atoms in

5

evaporative cooling process to further lower the temperature
and increase the phase-space density of molecular samples.

Theoretical studies on the mechanisms for inelastic col-
lisions with helium atoms in external ﬁelds are few, and
have been limited to molecules in 2Σ and 3Σ ground states
[18, 19, 20, 21, 22], although a study on collisions be-
tween He and the OH radical (in a 2Π state) is forthcoming
[23]. For 2Σ molecules the Zeeman relaxation occurs through
spin-rotational coupling between the rotational ground state
and rotationally excited states.
[24]. Calculations for CaF
and CaH molecules have shown that Zeeman relaxation rates
are strongly dependent on the spin-rotation interaction con-
stant γsr and decrease with the energy difference between
rotational states. The experimental data available for these
molecules conﬁrm this [1, 25].

For higher-spin states, no experimental data is available. It
is, however, predicted that the Zeeman relaxation rates are

is the dominating factor and again a larger energy difference
between the rotational states decreases the couplings between
LFS and HFS states. As a consequence, the spin-spin inter-
action parameter λss should be relatively small and the rota-
tional constant large to successfully trap molecules [24]. For
the NH (3Σ−) radical, the calculated ratio of elastic to inelas-
tic collisions has been shown to be favorable for trapping ex-
periments [22].

About the collisional properties of molecules in ground
states other than 2Σ or 3Σ little is known. An unsuccessful
attempt was made to buffer gas cool and trap VO molecules
(4Σ− ground state), but it is unclear whether Zeeman relax-
ation was a problem [9]. Theoretical calculations that pre-
dict collisional properties of such high-spin molecules are un-
known to us. Based on the lack of such data, we here propose
to buffer gas cool molecules with a high-spin ground state to
investigate their suitability for magnetic trapping and possible
evaporative cooling experiments. By extrapolating the cases
built for 2Σ and 3Σ molecules, we assume that the candidate
molecule should possess a large rotational constant B and a
small spin-spin interaction constant γss to minimize spin-spin
couplings. As diatomics containing hydrogen atoms are those
with the largest rotational constants, metal hydrides form a
natural choice.

Apart from such general criteria more practical considera-
tions also play a role. As is observed above, the trap depth
plays a crucial role in the possibility to conﬁne species over
longer time periods. In the present experiment, trap depths of
5.3 K and above have been employed with success. A useful
quantity to describe trapping is the capture efﬁciency parame-
ter η, deﬁned as the ratio of trap depth to sample temperature;
η = µHmax/kbTmol, where µ is the molecular magnetic mo-
ment, Hmax the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the trap edge and
Tmol the Boltzmann temperature of the molecular sample. In
the current experiment the trap edge is formed by the cell wall,
where the highest achievable magnetic ﬁeld is 1.7 T. Thus, at
the observed initial temperatures of 1.4 K (evaluated at t=2
s), η should be larger than 3.8 for a successful (initial) con-
ﬁnement of a substantial sample of molecules. This yields a
minimum magnetic moment of about 4.5 µB.

a large enough magnetic moment to allow for a trap depth of
at least 5 K. Molecules that could fulﬁll this condition are dis-
cussed in Section IV.

IV. SEARCH FOR A MOLECULAR CANDIDATE FOR
BUFFER GAS COOLING

As He atoms are highly nonreactive and do not easily form
new species, we can consider the helium buffer gas cooling an
universal cooling method. As such, it has already been shown
that one can use this technique as a source of cold molecules
[17]. However, if the cooling is to be combined with mag-
netic trapping of the (paramagnetic) species, the universality
is severely limited due to several constraints. At the heart of
these constraints lie inelastic collisions, in which molecules
in a low-ﬁeld seeking (LFS) state undergo a transition into
a high-ﬁeld seeking (HFS) state, a process often referred to
as Zeeman relaxation. The HFS molecules are then rapidly
ejected from the trapping region. The ratio of inelastic to elas-
tic collisions is thus crucial for the efﬁcient transfer of energy
while maintaining the molecules in a trappable state. The col-
lision partners can be a molecule and a helium atom, but also
two molecules. The former case is crucial for the feasibil-
ity of buffer-gas loading, while the latter governs a possible

Based on the above mentioned criteria, we have performed
an extensive literature search to ﬁnd an interesting and suitable
molecular candidate for buffer gas cooling and magnetic trap-
ping. The results are gathered in Table I. To compile this ta-
ble, only molecules have been listed that possess an electronic
ground state with at least a fourfold multiplicity. For compari-
son, the molecules studied so far using buffer-gas cooling have
been included: CaH, NH, CaF as well as the oxygen molecule
(16O18O), a long time prime candidate. As a further restric-
tion, only molecules that have been observed in experimen-
tal work and for which a rotational constant is experimentally
obtained are included. A column is added with the ratio of
the spin-spin interaction and rotational constants, |λss/B|, to
guide the selection process in minimizing the expected effects
of Zeeman relaxation.

An inspection of this table indicates that there are three
molecules that clearly stand out in terms of expected stabil-
ity against Zeeman relaxation: CrH in its 6Σ+ ground state,
MnH (7Σ+) and MnF (7Σ+). All three molecules possess a
large magnetic moment, which is nominally 5 and 6 µB, re-
spectively. We disqualify the MnF molecule, as it has a sub-
stantially smaller rotational constant, which would result in
level crossings between different rotational manifolds at ﬁelds
lower than 0.25 T [52]. One could point out that the TiH
molecule also possesses a large magnetic moment and rota-
tional constant that should avoid these level crossings; how-
ever, it is believed that non-Σ state molecules are highly sus-
ceptible to Zeeman relaxation, as direct couplings between

6

Zeeman states tend to become large [23]. Since in addition
no value of the spin-spin interaction constant could be found
for TiH, it is left out of consideration.

Both CrH and MnH fulﬁll the requirements of a large rota-
tional constant, a small spin-spin interaction constant while at
the same time having a high-spin ground state which should
be amenable for magnetic trapping. Both CrH and MnH were
ﬁrst observed in the 1930‘s by Gaydon and Pearse [41, 42].
CrH has by far attracted the most experimental attention as a
prototype for high-spin diatomic molecules, especially since
it was discovered in the emission spectra of L-type brown
dwarfs [43]; for an overview, see [44] and references therein.
Because of its high-spin ground state, CrH is employed as
a probe for magnetic ﬁeld strengths in sunspots [45]. The
magnetic parameters of CrH are well-established in the X6Σ+
electronic ground state by FIR laser-magnetic resonance spec-
troscopy [30]. Recently, we also measured the Zeeman spec-
trum of the A6Σ+ ←X6Σ+ (1-0) transition around 767 nm,
thereby determining the spectroscopic parameters of the ex-
cited state that are needed to simulate spectra recorded in
an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [46]. For MnH, the ex-
perimental studies are more sparse, which is likely due to
the highly complex structure of the spectroscopic transitions
which are split into numerous hyperﬁne components. The
A7Π+ ←X7Σ+ (0-0) and (1-0) transitions near 624 and
568 nm, respectively, are well characterized [47, 48, 49] and
the ground state has been studied using ESR spectroscopy
[50, 51].

Based on the extensive experimental information available,
it seems that the CrH radical is currently the most promising
high-spin candidate for studying the mechanisms involved in
buffer gas cooling, although it can not be ruled out that the
signiﬁcantly lower spin-spin interaction of MnH will favour
this molecule in the end.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated the buffer-gas loading of paramag-
netic species into a magnetic trap. In ﬁrst experiments we con-
ﬁned Cr atoms with storage times of more than one minute.
The use of an absorption based detection scheme combined
with a simulation of the absorption properties of the cloud in
the presence of the inhomogeneous magnetic trapping ﬁeld al-
lows us to extract relevant parameters. Given storage times of
more than one minute, thermal contact between the trapped
cloud and the walls of the experimental cell is reliably broken
after a period of 30 s and equilibrium temperatures reach ∼
350 mK after spontaneous evaporative cooling. Observed ini-
tial number densities exceed 1013 per cm3. We have also suc-
ceeded in implementing continuous non-destructive absorp-
tion imaging of the trapped cloud, which can provide comple-
mentary information on temperature and internal state distri-
bution over the whole trapping volume.

Progressing towards the preparation of cold molecules, we
have outlined the criteria for selecting a molecular candidate
to study in buffer gas cooling experiments. Such a molecule
should have, apart from a high magnetic moment, a low cross-

section for spin-changing collisions which would result in trap
loss. Due to their large rotational constants and small spin-
spin interaction coefﬁcients, the MnH and CrH molecules
have been identiﬁed as potentially suitable species. We will
thus proceed by experimentally investigating the relevant col-
lisional properties of these molecules. Measurements on the
effect of trap depth on the capture efﬁciency show that, if the
spin-changing collision rates are sufﬁciently low, the current
experimental setup should allow for trapping and thermally
isolating CrH and MnH.

We present a semi-relativistic model for the description of the ionization process of atomic hy-
drogen by electron impact in the ﬁrst Born approximation by using the Darwin wave function to
describe the bound state of atomic hydrogen and the Sommerfeld-Maue wave function to describe
the ejected electron. This model, accurate to ﬁrst order in Z/c in the relativistic correction, shows
that, even at low kinetic energies of the incident electron, spin eﬀects are small but not negligible.
These eﬀects become noticeable with increasing incident electron energies. All analytical calcula-
tions are exact and our semi-relativistic results are compared with the results obtained in the non
relativistic Coulomb Born Approximation both for the coplanar asymmetric and the binary coplanar
geometries.

INTRODUCTION

Relativistic (e, 2e) processes have been reviewed both
from the experimental and theoretical point of view
[1]. As one deals with atomic hydrogen, the value of
the parameter Zα is very lower than one, where Z is
the atomic charge number and α is the ﬁne structure
constant. Therefore, it is convenient and suﬃcient to
use approximate wave functions of a mathematically
simpler structure than the exact analytical wave func-
tions needed to describe relativistic (e, 2e) processes.
A numerical approach to an exact description of the
relativistic ionization of atomic hydrogen by electron
impact could be carried out but we will focus instead on
an alternative approach that will give nearly the same
1
results as the exact description if the condition Zα
is satisﬁed.
In (e, 2e) processes, relativistic eﬀects are
important and all electrons (the incident, scattered
and ejected) can have very high velocities. One has to
consider many interactions (to name some, retardation
interaction, magnetic interaction and spin-dependent
interaction). For atomic hydrogen, many experimental
and theoretical contributions have been made [2-3].
Some were successful but the theoretical situation for
all set-ups and kinematics is far from resolved, at least
analytically. Many calculations have resorted to various
approximations.
For example, plane wave models
[4-7] are successful in the coplanar binary geometries
[4] and for fast scattered and ejected electrons. The
ﬁrst Born approximation (FBA) has been used to
describe asymmetric geometries at non relativistic
In this approximation, the incident
energies [8-9].

and scattered electrons are described by plane waves
whereas the ejected electron is treated as a Coulomb
wave. Many authors extended this approximation to
the relativistic domain. Das et al
[10-11] employed
a semi-relativistic Sommerfeld-Maue wave functions
to describe the ejected electron. Jakubaßa-Amundsen
evaluated the ﬁrst-order transition matrix element Sf i
using semi-relativistic Coulomb wave functions times
a free spinor i.e neglecting the relativistic contraction
of the bound state and approximating the continuum
Coulomb state by a relativistic Coulomb wave times a
free spinor. This model did well in predicting integrated
cross-sections [12] but yielded a value for the absolute
triple diﬀerential cross section (TDCS) too large. For
the Coulomb approximation,
Jakubaßa-Amundsen
argued that one could not neglect the Coulomb potential
in the treatment of
ionization of high-Z
inner-shell
atoms. Agreement with experiment was encouraging for
intermediate values of Z. The merits and shortcomings
of this theory have been analyzed in [14]. Thereafter, a
fully relativistic version was produced [15] which showed
that the original physical insight was essentially correct.

In this contribution, we present a theoretical semi-
relativistic model, the semi-relativistic Coulomb Born
Approximation (SRCBA) in a closed and exact form
for the description of the ionization of atomic hydrogen
by electron impact that is valid for all geometries.
Indeed, in the non relativistic Coulomb Born Approx-
imation (NRCBA), a well known integral occurs [16]
and is usually denoted by I(λ).
In this article, we
show that the main contribution to the unpolarized
triple diﬀerential cross section (TDCS) in the SRCBA
corresponding to the ionization of atomic hydrogen in
its ground state by electron impact comes from this
term added to relativistic corrections valid to ﬁrst order
in Z/c. These relativistic corrections contain a new

integral we have denoted J(λ) and in the Appendix,
we give the formal derivation of this integral. To our
it is the ﬁrst time that such an integral
knowledge,
is written down analytically. Needless to say that all
numerical appropriate tests to check the validity of the
analytical result we have found have been carried out
with a very good degree of accuracy. It turns out that
spin eﬀects can be accounted for even at low kinetic
energies of the incident electron in the case of the
Ehrhardt coplanar asymmetric geometry [17] where, for
a given kinetic energy Ti of the fast incident electron,
a fast (”scattered ”) electron of kinetic energy Tf is
detected in coincidence with a slow (”ejected”) electron
of kinetic energy TB. These spin eﬀects as well as the
relativistic eﬀects become noticeable with increasing
incident electron kinetic energy.

The organization of this paper is as follows : in section
II, we present the semi relativistic formalism of (e, 2e)
reaction and give a detailed account of the various terms
that contribute to the unpolarized TDCS, in section III,
we discuss the results we have obtained and we end by a
brief conclusion in section IV. The formal derivation of
the integral J(λ) is given in the Appendix. Throughout
this work, atomic units (a.u) are used (~ = me = e = 1)
where me is the electron rest mass.

II. THE UNPOLARIZED TRIPLE
DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION

In this section, we calculate the exact analytical ex-
pression of the semi relativistic unpolarized TDCS in the
SRCBA corresponding to the ionization of atomic hydro-
gen by electron impact. The transition matrix element
for the direct channel (exchange eﬀects are neglected) is
given by

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Coplanar asymmetric geometries

  TDCS(SRCBA)/TDCS(NRCBA)

We begin our discussion by considering well known re-
sults in the non relativistic domain, namely the results
of Byron and Joachain [17] and those of Berakdar [21].
All these results are obtained in the coplanar asymmetric

geometry. Let us consider the process whereby an inci-
dent electron with a kinetic energy Ei = 250 eV scatters
with a hydrogen atom. The ejected electron is observed
to have a kinetic energy EB = 5 eV and the scattered
electron is observed having an angle θf = 3.
In this
particular case, the CBA is not as accurate as the results
obtained within the framework of the Eikonal Born series
[17] which contains higher order corrections.

Nevertheless, as it can be seen in Fig. 1, the agreement
between the non relativistic and semi-relativistic results
is good since we obtain two identical curves. However,
even in this non relativistic regime, small eﬀects due to

FIG. 2: The ratio T DCS(SRCBA)/T DCS(N RCBA) as
function of the angle θB with θf = 3◦. The incident elec-
tron kinetic energy is Ti = 250
eV and the ejected electron
kinetic energy is TB = 5 eV

.

the semi-relativistic treatment of the wave functions we
have used, show that there are indeed small eﬀects that
can only be tracked back to the spin. Indeed, if we plot
the ratio of the semi-relativistic TDCS and the non rela-
tivistic TDCS, it emerges that however small, these spin
eﬀects can reach 0, 45% for some speciﬁc angles. We re-
call that the TDCS has extrema, in particular when the
direction of pB coincides with that of the vectors ∆ and

−

∆ and this can be seen in Fig. 2.
In the former case, the extremum is always a maximum
and in the latter case the extremum is a local maximum.
The two TDCSs exhibit in this geometry a forward or
binary peak with a maximum in the direction of ∆ and
∆.

The locations of such extrema are θB ≈ −
52◦ with a ratio equal
ratio equal to 1.00234 and θB ≈
to 1.00185. These mechanisms for the emergence of the
binary-recoil peak structure are also present even when
one uses the simplest description in which plane waves
for incoming and outgoing particles are assumed [22].

Now, if we compare our result with the result obtained
by Berakdar [21], we also obtain a good agreement. But
before beginning the discussion proper, let us recall the

formed within a model where the three-body ﬁnal state is
described by a product of three symmetrical, Coulomb-
type functions. Each of these functions describes the mo-
tion of a particular two-body subsystem in the presence
of a third charged particle. Thereafter, he made a com-
prehensive comparison with available experimental data
and with other theoretical models. He ended his study by
concluding that generally, good agreement is found with
the absolute measurements but that however, in some
cases discrepancies between various theoretical predic-
tions and experimental ﬁndings are obvious, which high-
lights the need for a theoretical and experimental bench-
mark study of these reactions. In Fig. 3, we compare

our results with those obtained by Berakdar for an inci-
dent electron kinetic energy Ei = 250 eV for the case of
a coplanar asymmetric geometric where θf = θB = 90◦.
The ejected electron kinetic energy is EB = 5 eV and
φf = 357◦. What is remarkable is the agreement be-
tween our results and his bearing in mind that he used
the DS3C formalism (DS3C stands for dynamical screen-
ing theory with three Coulomb-type functions). Another
atypical result related to our calculations is the behavior
of the ratio of the T DCS(SRCBA)/T DCS(N RCBA)
where now the maxima of this ratio correspond nearly to
the local minima of the TDCS when plotted as a function
of the angle φB. This is shown in Fig 4. However, there
is no rule that can be inferred from the behavior of this
ratio since when performing various simulations even in
the coplanar asymmetric geometry but with increasing
values of the incident electron kinetic energy, there are
many regions not close to the binary or secondary peaks
that present maxima or minima.

to an incident electron kinetic energy of Ei = 2700 eV .
Because there is no experimental data available for this
regime, we simply compare our results with those we have

previously found when we introduced the RPWBA [23]
(relativistic plane wave Born approximation)to study the
ionization of atomic hydrogen by electron impact in the
binary geometry. In Fig. 5, it is clearly visible that the
three models (NRCBA, SRCBA and RPWBA) give the
same results which was to be expected since in this geom-
etry, the use of a Coulomb wave function is not necessary.

In Fig. 6, there is a shift of the maximum of the TDCS
in the SRCBA towards smaller values than θB = 45◦ and
this remains the case for increasing values of the kinetic
energy of the incident electron. The origin of this shift
stems from the fact that the main contribution to the
TDCS comes from the term H1(q) given by Eq. (16).
This term contains a dominant integral I1. When plot-
ting the behavior of I1 as function of the angle θB, and
with increasing values of Ei, one observes the shift we
have mentioned as well as the fact that in the relativis-
tic regime, the TDCS(SRCBA) is always lower than the
TDCS(NRCBA).

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have developed an exact semi-
relativistic model in the ﬁrst Born approximation that is
valid for a wide range of geometries, simple in its mathe-
matical structure and that allows to ﬁnd previous results
using sophisticated non-relativistic models. This model
gives good results if the condition Zα

1 is fulﬁlled.

APPENDIX A: ANALYTICAL CALCULATION
OF THE INTEGRAL J(λ)

Before turning to the analytical calculation of the inte-
gral J(λ) proper, let us recall how the integral I(λ) [16]
can be obtained. This is explained without any detail
in [20]. Using parabolic coordinates, one has to evaluate
the following integral

I(λ) =

We have tested this analytical result by performing the
integral using two gaussian quadratures because we have
assumed without loss of generality both q and pB to be
parrallel to the Oz axis. The ﬁrst one, a Laguerre gaus-
sian quadrature (32 points) to integrate over the radial
variable r and the second one, using a Legendre gaussian
quadrature (32 points) to integrate over the angular vari-
able θ. The agreement between the analytical result and
the numerical result is excellent. To illustrate this point,
we give as an exemple the results obtained by the two

methods for the following random values of the relevant

Abstract

Today, the ’hydrogen atom model’ is known to play its role not only in teaching
the basic elements of quantum mechanics but also for building up eﬀective theories in
atomic and molecular physics, quantum optics, plasma physics, or even in the design of
semiconductor devices. Therefore, the analytical as well as numerical solutions of the
hydrogen–like ions are frequently required both, for analyzing experimental data and for
carrying out quite advanced theoretical studies. In order to support a fast and consistent
access to these (Coulomb–ﬁeld) solutions, here we present the Dirac program which has
been developed originally for studying the properties and dynamical behaviour of the
(hydrogen–like) ions. In the present version, a set of Maple procedures is provided for
the Coulomb wave and Green’s functions by applying the (wave) equations from both, the
nonrelativistic and relativistic theory. Apart from the interactive access to these functions,
moreover, a number of radial integrals are also implemented in the Dirac program which
may help the user to construct transition amplitudes and cross sections as they occur
frequently in the theory of ion–atom and ion–photon collisions.

Keywords: Analytical solution, Coulomb–Green’s function, Coulomb problem, Dirac equation,
energy level, expectation value, hydrogen–like ion, hydrogenic wavefunction, matrix element,
radial integral, special functions.

Nature of the physical problem:
Analytical solutions of the hydrogen atom are widely used in very diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics
[2,3]. Despite of the rather simple structure of the hydrogen–like ions, however, the underlying
’mathematics’ is not always that easy to deal with. Apart from the well–known level structure
of these ions as obtained from either the Schr¨odinger or Dirac equation, namely, a great
deal of other properties are often needed. These properties are related to the interaction of
bound electron(s) with external particles and ﬁelds and, hence, require to evaluate transition
amplitudes, including wavefunctions and (transition) operators of quite diﬀerent complexity.
Although various special functions, such as the Laguerre polynomials, spherical harmonics,
Whittaker functions, or the hypergeometric functions of various kinds can be used in most
cases in order to express these amplitudes in a concise form, their derivation is time consuming
and prone for making errors. In addition to their complexity, moreover, there exist a large
number of mathematical relations among these functions which are diﬃcult to remember in
detail and which have often hampered quantitative studies in the past.

Method of solution:
A set of Maple procedures is developed which provides both the nonrelativistic and rela-
tivistic (analytical) solutions of the ‘hydrogen atom model‘ and which facilitates the symbolic
evaluation of various transition amplitudes.

Restrictions onto the complexity of the problem:
Over the past decades, a large number of representations have been worked out for the hydro-
genic wave and Green’s functions, using diﬀerent variables and coordinates [2]. From these,
the position–space representation in spherical coordinates is certainly of most practical inter-
est and has been used as the basis of the present implementation. No attempt has been made
by us so far to provide the wave and Green’s functions also in momentum space, for which
the relativistic momentum functions would have to be constructed numerically.
Although the Dirac program supports both symbolic and numerical computations, the latter
one are based on Maple’s standard software ﬂoating–point algorithms and on the (attempted)
precision as deﬁned by the global Digits variable. Although the default number, Digits =
10, appears suﬃcient for many computations, it often leads to a rather dramatic loss in the
accuracy of the relativistic wave functions and integrals, mainly owing to Maple’s imprecise
internal evaluation of the corresponding special functions. Therefore, in order to avoid such
computational diﬃculties, the Digits variable is set to 20 whenever the Dirac program is
(re–)loaded.

Unusual features of the program:
The Dirac program has been designed for interactive work which, apart from the standard
solutions and integrals of the hydrogen atom, also support the use of (approximate) semirela-
tivistic wave functions for both, the bound– and continuum states of the electron. To provide
a fast and accurate access to a number of radial integrals which arise frequently in applica-
tions, the analytical expressions for these integrals have been implemented for the one–particle
operators rk, e−
σr, dm/drm, jL(kr) as well as for the (so–called) two–particle Slater integrals
which are needed to describe the Coulomb repulsion among the electrons. Further procedures
of the Dirac program concern, for instance, the conversion of the physical results between
diﬀerent unit systems or for diﬀerent sets of quantum numbers. A brief description of all pro-
cedures as available in the present version of the Dirac program is given in the user manual
Dirac-commands.pdf which is distributed together with the code.

Typical running time: Although the program replies promptly on most requests, the running
time also depends on the particular task.

Introduction

Since the beginning of quantum mechanics, the hydrogen atom has been one of the best
studied models in physics [1, 2]. In a large number of textbooks and monographs, therefore,
its (well–known) solutions from either the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation or Dirac’s
(relativistic) wave equation have served as standard examples in introducing atomic theory.
But apart from the educational insight as obtained from the hydrogen atom model, the theory
of the one–electron atoms and ions has found its way also into quite diﬀerent ﬁelds of modern
physics including molecular and plasma physics, quantum optics, or the theory of quantum
information. When combined with the atomic shell model, i.e. the successive ﬁlling of shells
as established for instance by the periodic table of elements, the (analytical) solutions of the
‘hydrogen atom‘ help understand many atomic processes in Nature, at least qualitatively.
During the last decades, moreover, Dirac’s theory of the hydrogen–like ions has been applied
successfully for describing energetic collisions of high–Z ions with atomic targets [3] or for
testing quantum–electrodynamical (QED) eﬀects [4], if Furry’s picture and ﬁeld–theoretical
concepts are taken into account.

As seen from this wide–spread use of the hydrogen atom model, therefore, a fast and interactive
access to the solutions and properties of the one–electron ions is highly desirable. In the past,
several program have been developed and implemented into the cpc program library for
calculating the hydrogenic wave and Green’s functions, both within the nonrelativistic [5, 6]
and relativistic [7, 8] framework. Beside of providing these functions explicitly, they have been
implemented also — at least to a certain extent — in a large number of further codes including
those for studying the two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions [8], their interaction with
lasers [9] and electrons [10], the excitation and ionization of such ions by Coulomb ﬁelds [11],
their bound–bound transitions in the presence of external magnetic ﬁelds [12], and at many
places elsewhere. But although these programs have certainly found useful for understanding
the properties and behaviour of one–electron atoms and ions, they have two drawbacks in
common which restrict their further application: Since these programs are designed for a very
particular task, they often (i) cannot be extended so easily to other problems. Moreover, by
using standard languages such as Fortran or C, these programs do (ii) not support any
algebraic (symbolic) access to the wave functions and matrix element as required by more
advanced studies. The lack of symbolic techniques, in particular, and together with the low
ﬂexibility in dealing with the input and output of the programs from above have hampered
their use for a much wider range of applications.

Today, a new and promising alternative for having an algebraic access to complex (symbolic)
expressions is oﬀered by computer algebra including the general purpose systems such as
Mathematica or Maple. In the last decade, they have been increasingly utilized to provide
a fast and reliable gateway to a large set of complex expressions and computations. With the
development of the Dirac program, we here provide a set of Maple procedures for studying
the properties and the dynamical behaviour of the hydrogen–like ions. In the past two years,
this program has been used to support not only the interpretation of experiments but also

4

for a detailed analysis of the polarization and correlation properties of the x–ray radiation as
emitted by relativistic collisions [13, 14]. Owing to its interactive design, moreover, the Dirac
program may help the user not only in his or her daily research work but also in teaching the
physics of (hydrogen–like) atoms and ions.

Obviously, however, a program about the hydrogen atom model can neither be implemented
comprehensively nor explained within a single step. Therefore, the Dirac package will be
presented in several steps, each of them dedicated to a well deﬁned part of the theory. To
provide access to the very basic elements of the theory, here we ﬁrst describe a set of proce-
dures for the symbolic (as well as numerical) computation of the wave and Green’s functions.
These functions are provided for both, the bound– and continuum–state solutions of the non-
relativistic as well as relativistic theory. Having once a simple access to these functions, of
course, they can be rather easily applied to construct the transitions amplitudes and matrix
elements for a large number of other properties. For several — frequently required — matrix
elements, an algebraic evaluation of the radial integrals has been implemented also explicitly.

Although the main purpose of this work is to describe the design and the use of the Dirac
package, in the next section we ﬁrst compile the basic equations and expressions from the
theory of the hydrogen atom with emphasis on those which have been implemented in the code.
In Section 3, we later describe the organization of the program and how it is distributed. This
sections also lists all the user–accessible commands together with a short description, while a
detailed explanation of the parameters, optional arguments and some additional information
for each procedure is given in an additional user manual and is appended to the code. This is
followed in Section 4 by a number of selected examples to illustrate the interactive use of the
Dirac program within its Maple environment. A short outlook onto future developments
and extensions of the program is ﬁnally given in Section 5.

2 Theoretical background

Since the quantum–mechanical theory of the one–electron atoms has been worked out long
time ago, both within the nonrelativistic and relativistic framework, we may refer for most
details to the literature. Helpful introductions into this topic can be found, for instance, in
the texts by Bethe and Salpeter [1], Messiah [15], Bransden and Joachain [2], Eichler and
Meyerhof [3], and by many others. In the present work, therefore, we will restrict ourselves
to rather a short compilation of the basic expressions, just enough in order to introduce the
notations and formulas as implemented within the Dirac program.
In the following two
subsections 2.1 and 2.2, in particular, we brieﬂy recall the (analytically well known) radial–
angular representation of the hydrogen wave and Green’s functions which are later applied in
subsection 2.3 for evaluating a number of radial integrals. Emphasis has ﬁrst been paid to
those integrals which are of frequent use in the computation of the structural and dynamical
properties of the hydrogen–like ions. In this paper (and also in most parts of the underlying
implementation of the Dirac code), atomic Hartree units ~ = me = e2/4πǫ0 = 1, where ǫ0
is the permittivity of free space, are used throughout unless speciﬁed otherwise.

As seen from this ansatz (2), the electronic wavefunction ψ(r)
ψ(r, θ, φ) is therefore given
as a product of a radial function R(r) or P (r)/r, respectively, and a spherical harmonic
Ylm(ϑ, ϕ) which describes the angular structure and which depends on the orbital angular
momentum l and its projection onto the quantization axis as denoted by the magnetic quantum
number m. However, not much need to be said here about the properties and treatment of
the spherical harmonics as one of the standard tasks from the theory of angular momentum
[16] for which meanwhile also a number of symbolic tools are available [17, 18]. The (radial)

can be used to describe the relativistic motion of a spin–1/2 electron in the ﬁeld of a nucleus
with charge Z which, apart from the kinetic and potential energy of the electron, now also
contains its rest energy as well as contributions due to the electron spin [2, 3]. Analogue to
the nonrelativistic case, the solution ψ(r) of Eq. (9) can be separated again into a radial and
angular part

deﬁnition of κ =
2, ..., this quantum number carries information about both, the total
angular momentum j and the parity (–1)l of the wavefunction. As usual, the Dirac spin–

As seen from ansatz (10), moreover, the radial part of the wavefunctions is now given by the
two functions P (r) and Q(r) which are called the large and small components, respectively.
Similar to the nonrelativistic case, an analytic representation of these two components is
known and is diﬀerent for an electron in a bound or continuum state where, apart from
the continuum with positive energies E > 0 an additional continuous branch (of solutions)
2c2 exists. As known from Dirac’s theory, these solutions with
with negative energies E
negative energies require special care and can be re–interpreted, for instance, in terms of
positron states. For the bound states of hydrogen–like ions, the (discrete eigen–) energies of

example, in the text by Eichler and Meyerhof [3]. However, these continuum states are also
implemented in the Dirac package and can be accessed as well by means of the procedures
Dirac spinor() and Dirac radial component().

2.1.3 Semirelativistic framework

The two radial functions (13) and (14) represent, together with Eq. (10), an exact solution
of the Dirac equation for a pure Coulomb potential. In practice, however, the use of these
radial components often leads to rather lengthy and complicated computations. Instead of the
exact form, therefore, the approximate Darwin wavefunctions [19] have been widely used in
applications such as the theoretical description of the Coulomb ionization [20] or the electron–
positron pair creation [21]. For a Coulomb potential,

are expressed in terms of the nonrelativistic solutions (2–5) of the Schr¨odinger equation
from subsection 2.1.1, where u(+) = (1, 0, 0, 0)+ and u(
) = (0, 1, 0, 0)+ are the two four–
component spinors for a particle at rest with either spin–up or spin–down, respectively. Ob-
viously, the Darwin functions (19) have a much simpler structure when compared with the
exact bound–state solutions (13) and (14) from above; they are accurate to ﬁrst–order in αZ
in the expansion of the Dirac equation and are normalized to the same order.

−

Apart from the bound states (19), approximate continuum wavefunctions can be derived
which are accurate to αZ in the relativistic motion of the electron and which are known
as Sommerfeld–Maue wavefunctions [22] from the literature. Again, these functions can be
expressed in terms of the nonrelativistic functions and have been widely used in applications
[21, 23]. Although the explicit form of these functions is slightly more complicated than in the
bound case, their derivation follows very similar lines. Here, we will not display these functions
in detail but simply refer to the procedures Dirac Darwin() and Dirac Sommerfeld Maue() of
the Dirac code which facilitate the access to both, the Darwin and the Sommerfeld–Maue
semirelativistic approximations.

2.2 Green’s function

Apart from the wavefunctions, which describe the electron in some particular quantum state,
one often needs the summation over all the (unoccupied) states, especially if parts of the atomic
interaction are treated as a perturbation. Such a summation over the complete spectrum is
required, for example, for describing the two– (and multi–) photon processes in hydrogen–like
ions [24] or for the computation of hyperpolarizabilities. Although, in principle, it appears
straightforward to carry out such a summation explicitly by using the function from above,
the large number of terms and the need for integrating over the electron continuum may
hamper such an approach. Instead, the use of the Green’s function

G(r, r′; E) =

is usually much more favorable since it provides a simple access to the perturbative treatment
of various types of interactions in the computation of atomic properties.

As easily shown, the Green’s function (20) can be obtained generally as solution of the inho-

where ˆH denotes the Hamiltonian operator of the system. Similar to the case of the wave-

function depends of course on the framework in which the system is described. For the
Schr¨odinger operator ˆH =
V (r) (the nonrelativistic case), for example, the solu-
tions of Eq. (21) can be separated – again – into radial and angular functions by means of

2.3 Integrals with hydrogenic wavefunctions

The Coulomb wave and Green’s functions from the previous subsections can be applied for
studying the properties and dynamics of hydrogen–like ions. Usually, they are the basic
ingredients in deﬁning the transition amplitudes and cross sections and, by using their radial–
integral decompositions in Eqs. (2), (10), and (22) immediately lead to a number of radial
integrals including various types of (transition) operators. While, of course, these integrals
can always be determined numerically, an analytic (pre–) evaluation of these integrals is in
many cases possible and results in a considerable gain in the computation of the transition
amplitudes. Often, moreover, the analytic evaluation of the radial integrals is faster and more
accurate when compared with a (straightforward) numerical integration. For several integrals,
which frequently arise in applications, therefore, the analytic formulas have been implemented
explicitly into the Dirac code. Below, we ﬁrst discuss the matrix elements containing the
σr, dm/drm, the integrals for studying the light–matter interaction or for
operators rk, e−
collisions with external particles, but turn later also to the (well–known) Slater integrals for
treating the interaction among the electrons.

2.3.1 Radial integrals of r–dependent operators

Nonrelativistic framework: For calculating the structure of the hydrogen–like ions and their
cross sections in collisions with atoms and electrons, one often needs the matrix elements
for the operators rk, dm/drm, e−
σr, or various combinations of these operators. Within
the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger theory, the analytic calculation of such r–dependent matrix
elements have been analyzed and discussed especially by S´anchez and L´opez Pin˜eiro [25] who
applied the hypervirial theorem along with a second quantization formalism. They showed
that these matrix elements can be typically reduced to radial integrals of the form

which can then be utilized also (if necessary) in order to compute the matrix elements including
some derivatives dm/drm Pnl(r) of the wave functions. For the sake of brevity, however,
we will not display these recursion formulas but only mention that, for all the operators
from above, the corresponding radial integrals can be evaluated by means of the procedure
Dirac r matrix element() of the Dirac program. In this procedure, an analytic evaluation of
the integrals is carried out whenever possible.

Relativistic framework: Of course, an analytical expression of the matrix elements with oper-
ators rk e−
σr can be found also for the relativistic Dirac wavefunctions. However, in order to
derive such expressions it is more convenient not to start from the standard representation of
the hydrogenic functions (13–14) but ﬁrst to re–write them in terms of a series expansion in r
as it was suggested originally by Rose [26]. By using such r–series representation, the rk e−
σr
matrix elements can be written, similar to (24), in term of Γ– functions as

In contrast to the radial integral (25), no analytic expressions for the matrix elements con-

in Dirac program. For all such matrix elements, however, the (straightforward) numerical
integration is applied by making use of the standard Maple command int().

2.3.2 Grant’s integrals

Relativistic framework: As known from relativistic collision theory [3, 27], the interaction of
(atomic) electrons with the radiation ﬁeld or with other atoms and ions can usually be traced
back to the computation of the following three radial integrals

dr jL(qr) (Pa(r)Qb(r)

Qa(r)Pb(r))

I 0
L (q; a, b) =

where jL(qr) denotes a spherical Bessel function of order L and, as before, P (r) and Q(r) are
the radial components of the one–electron wavefunctions (10). Because of the oscillations in
the Bessel as well as the radial wavefunctions, however, an accurate value of these integrals is
not always easy to obtain numerically. In the Dirac program, we therefore implemented the
analytic formulas for these integrals in terms of a ﬁnite series over the conﬂuent hypergeometric
functions as known for the bound–bound and bound–free transitions [28, 29]. While this
typically results in a much faster (and more accurate) computation of the integrals, it requires
however that at least one set of radial components — either Pa(r), Qa(r) or Pb(r), Qb(r) —
has to represent some bound–state electron.

Nonrelativistic framework: Since, in the limit c
, the small component Q(r) becomes neg-
ligible, only contributions from the last integral (29) survives in the nonrelativistic description
of interaction processes with the radiation ﬁeld and gives rise to the integral

JL(q; a, b) =

An analytic evaluation of this integral with nonrelativistic radial orbital functions is supported
by the procedure Dirac IJ radial() of the Dirac program for both, bound–bound and bound–free
electronic transitions.

2.3.3 Slater integrals

Although the main emphasis in developing the Dirac program has been placed on studying
the properties and behaviors of the hydrogen–like ions, the wave functions from above can be
used also to estimate the eﬀects of the electron–electron interaction for few–electron atoms
and ions. For such systems, one often needs to compute the (two–electron) matrix elements
for the Coulomb repulsion operator 1/r12 which, after some algebra, leads to the so–called
Slater integrals

hypergeometric functions has been implemented in the Dirac package for the nonrelativistic

framework. For reasons of eﬃciency, however, no attempt has been made to incorporate
also the ’relativistic version’ of the Slater integrals which would raise much larger demands
regarding the accurate computation of these values.

3 Program organization

3.1 Overview about the DIRAC package

The Dirac package has been developed as an interactive tool within the framework of Maple
(version 8).
It is designed in order to provide a simple and consistent access to the wave
functions, the excitation and decay properties as well as the dynamical behaviour of the
hydrogen–like ions. To allow for a rather large ﬂexibility in the use of the program, most
of the functions and quantities from the hydrogen atom model are supported both, within
the nonrelativistic as well as the relativistic theory. With the present version of Dirac, we
start with compiling diﬀerent (analytical) representations of the Coulomb wave and Green’s
functions using polar coordinates. In addition, both the analytical and numerical evaluation
of the – most frequently – required integrals are supported and now facilitate their accurate
computation for a large number of properties.

Following Maple’s philosophy, the Dirac program is organized in a hierarchical order. In
the current version, there are about 50 procedures at quite diﬀerent level of complexity from
which most however are kept hidden to the user. As in Maple’s own design, these procedures
mainly serve as language elements in order to build up commands at some higher level of the
hierarchy. Therefore, only about 15 procedures at top level need to be known by the user
and are brieﬂy summarized in Table 1. More detailed information about the use of these
procedures, their optional arguments, or the output can be obtained from the user manual
Dirac-commands.pdf which is distributed together with code.
In this manual, we mainly
follow the style of the help pages of Maple and The Maple Handbook by Redfern [30] from
earlier years. To illustrate some of the basic features of the program, moreover, a few selected
examples are displayed below.

As known from Maple’s recent up–grades, most of its internal commands make use of rather
short names and often of some abbreviations for the various quantities and methods. Although
such a name convention might be favorable for the frequent use of the commands, these names
are usually not easy to remember and to recognize in their output if implemented in a code. In
the Dirac program, therefore, we follow a slightly diﬀerent concept by making use of rather
long names to better explain the purpose of the procedures. In the long run, hopefully, this
will simplify the readability and the maintenance of the program. Moreover, all the commands
of the Dirac package begin with the additional preﬁx Dirac in order to distinguish them
from Maple’s internal functionality.

3.2 Getting started with DIRAC

The Dirac package is distributed as a compressed tar–ﬁle dirac.tar from which the dirac
root directory is obtained by the command tar -xvf dirac.tar. This root contains the
source code library (for Maple 8), a Read.me for the installation of the package as well as

13

Table 1: Main commands of the Dirac package. A more detailed description of these and a few less
important procedures is given in the user manual Dirac-commands.pdf and is distributed together
with the code.

the program manual dirac-commands.pdf. This latter document explains all the user rele-
vant commands along with the output format, their optional arguments and some additional
information which might be of interest for the application of the procedures. The dirac root
directory also contains an example of a .mapleinit ﬁle which can be easily modiﬁed and
incorporated into the user’s home. Making use of such a .mapleinit ﬁle, the module dirac
should then be available like any other module of Maple simply by typing

> with(dirac);

Welcome to Dirac

Dirac_save_nuclear_charge := Z
Dirac_save_framework := nonrelativistic
Dirac_save_units := atomic

As seen from the printout above, the settings of the Dirac program are speciﬁed by the
three global variables which must not be overwritten interactively. The (global) variable
Dirac save framework, for instance, speciﬁes the theoretical framework in which the var-
it may take the two values relativistic and
ious commands will respond to the user;
nonrelativistic and determines of how the input and output of the procedures is to be
treated internally.
In practice, of course, the input/output data of the procedures depend
not only on the framework but often also on the present choice of the units as speciﬁed by
the variable Dirac save units. In the Dirac program, we presently support atomic Hartree
(~=me=e2/4πǫ0 = 1), natural (me=c=e=1), SI, and Gaussian units which are recognized by
setting Dirac save units to one of its allowed values: atomic, natural, SI, or cgs, respec-
tively. Moreover, most of the solutions and output of interest will depend on the nuclear charge
Z as internally speciﬁed by the global variable Dirac save nuclear charge. To change these
particular speciﬁcations of the Dirac program, the command Dirac settings() can be used; if
instead of ’atomic’ units, the user wishes to employ ’natural’ units for the input and output
of the procedures, the initial speciﬁcation can be modiﬁed by entering

> Dirac settings(units, natural);

Units are changed to natural

Therefore, by specifying the global variables properly due to the demands of the user, the
procedures of the Dirac program can be adapted to the particular task. A proper choice of
these global deﬁnitions makes the program appropriate for a wide range of applications.

Interactive work with the DIRAC program

To illustrate the use of the Dirac program and to provide some test cases, below we will
display and explain a few examples concerning the ﬁne–structure of the hydrogen–like ions
as well as the (algebraic) access to their wave functions. A more advanced example later
shows the computation of matrix elements within the relativistic framework as they arise
frequently in the study of light–matter interactions. For all these examples, we assume the
Dirac program to be loaded into the current Maple session as explained in the previous
section 3.2.

4.1 Fine structure of hydrogen–like ions

In the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger theory, the level energies (4) only depend on the principal
quantum number n and, hence, are degenerate with respect to the orbital quantum number l
and the magnetic quantum number m. This 2 n2 degeneracy (the factor 2 arises from the spin
of the electrons), however, is partially removed if Dirac’s theory is applied. In the relativistic
case (12), namely, the nonrelativistic levels with energy En split into n diﬀerent sublevels
according to the total angular momentum j = 1/2, 3/2, ... n
1/2 of the state. This splitting,
which is known as the ﬁne–structure of the hydrogen–like ions, can be easily illustrated below
by means of the Dirac program.

−

To obtain insight into this splitting as a function of the nuclear charge Z, let us ﬁrst compare
the relativistic and nonrelativistic level energies for n = 2. Since the nonrelativistic framework
is predeﬁned whenever the Dirac program is (re–) loaded, we start with the Schr¨odinger
energy (4) which is returned for an arbitrary nuclear charge Z = Z0 by entering

> Dirac settings(charge, Z0);

> E 2(Z0) := Dirac energy(2);

Nuclear charge is changed to Z0

E_2(Z0) := - ---

0 /8 is returned,
Of course, the well–known nonrelativistic energy expression E n=2 =
given in atomic units as the default setting. Analogue, we may obtain the n = 2 energy
levels as predicted by the Dirac theory. To this end, we ﬁrst need to change to the relativistic
framework for all subsequent calls of the Dirac procedures

−

Framework is changed to relativistic

and, again, make use of the same command Dirac energy(). In the relativistic framework,
this procedure now expects the two arguments n and κ to return the level energy Enκ from
Eq. (12). To get the energy of a 2s1/2 electron with quantum numbers n=2 and κ = -1, we
type

which returns this energy in the most general form, including the nuclear charge Z0 and the
(unevaluated) ﬁne structure constant α as yet given by the global variable
Dirac Constant alpha. At the ﬁrst glance, such a general form may look quite complicated
but it helps of course in treating the expressions algebraically. For our discussion of the
ﬁne–structure behaviour as a function of Z, we may ﬁrst assume the αZ parameter small
when compared with unity and apply the standard Maple command series() to expand
this expression for the 2s1/2 energy in powers of Z

> series(E 2s(Z0), Z0):
> E 2s exp(Z0) := convert(%, polynom);

we ﬁnd the so–called relativistic Pauli correction ∆E nκ to the (nonrelativistic) level energy
[1, 2] which, as seen from the printout, scales like α2 Z 4
0 and, thus, will strongly increase for
high–Z ions.

The result above for the Pauli correction ∆Enκ displays the analytic behaviour of the ﬁne–
structure splitting; to get a better impression on the size of this splitting, we may evaluate
this expression for n = 2 also numerically. To substitute the value α = 1/137.036 of the ﬁne–
structure constant for Dirac Constant alpha, we may use the command Dirac evalf() in
the Dirac program and obtain

> E 2s(Z0) := Dirac evalf(E 2s(Z0));

4.2 Relativistic contraction of the s–orbitals

In section 2, we have displayed the radial components for a bound–state electron for both,
the nonrelativistic (5) and relativistic theory (13–14). The spatial behaviour of these one–
electron solutions for diﬀerent nuclear charges Z has been discussed in detail at a number of
places [1, 3] to illustrate the ’relativistic eﬀects’ for high–Z ions. While, for small charges Z,
the radial Schr¨odinger function (5) and the large component (13) from the Dirac theory are
practically the same, a comparison of these functions for high–Z ions shows a clear contraction
of the large component towards the nucleus. This eﬀects, which is known as the relativistic
contraction of the wavefunctions, inﬂuences not only the structure of heavy (hydrogen–like)
ions but, for instance, also their ionization behaviour [31] or the chemical binding in materials
containing heavy elements.

To illustrate the contraction of the 3s wavefunction for a hydrogen–like uranium ion U 91+
by means of the Dirac program, we shall extract and compare the radial function (5) with
the large component (13) from Dirac’s theory. The algebraic expression for the P n=3, l=0 (r)
nonrelativistic function can be obtained by

where, in the ﬁrst two lines of printout, we set the nonrelativistic framework and deﬁne the
nuclear charge to be Z = 92.

Returning to the relativistic framework as before, the large component of a 3s1/2 electron is
generated in the Dirac program by calling

> P 3s r(r) := Dirac radial component(large, 3, -1, r):

for which, we suppress here the printout to screen (using the colon at the end of the line)
as this would result in quite a lengthy expression in terms of the hypergeometric function
and various physical constants [cf. Eq. (13)]. For the present purpose, instead, we ﬁrst better
’evaluate’ all the physical constants to their numerical values by calling

> P 3s r(r) := Dirac evalf(P rel(r));

P_3s_r(r) := 69.235282776899202095 r

plot them by using the standard Maple procedures plot(). Physically more important than
the wave function, however, is the ’contraction’ in the charge distribution as given by the

As expected, a clear contraction of the relativistic function (solid line) is found when compared

4.3 Evaluation of the relativistic radial integrals

Until now, we have demonstrated the use of the Dirac program by simple ’textbook examples’
such as the computation of the level energies or the hydrogenic wave functions. The Dirac
procedures, however, are able to help the user with much advanced studies concerning the
excitation and decay properties or the dynamical behaviour of the hydrogen–like ions. For such
investigations, we need to compute transition matrix elements including the wavefunctions
from above and the corresponding (transition) operators. The exact relativistic treatment of
the photoionization of hydrogen–like ions, for instance, can be traced back to the computation
of the bound–free transition amplitude [3]

where ψ nbκbµb(r) and ψ Ef κf mf (r) are the (relativistic) wavefunctions for the initially bound

The simpliﬁcation of the transition amplitude (32) requires elements from the algebra of
angular momentum and has been discussed elsewhere [3, 14]. In particular, it was shown that
this amplitude can be factorized into radial and angular parts where the latter ones evaluate
j symbols and a constant factor, while the radial part is reduced
to Wigner 3
to the integrals (27–29). Below, we therefore discuss how the Dirac package can be utilized
to compute these radial integrals. We start with the straightforward numerical integration of
the radial integral I 0
L=1(q; a, b) , which arises if a 1s1/2 electron (nb = 1, κb = –1) is ionized
by a photon with energy Eγ = 70 eV into a s1/2 continuum state (partial s
wave; κf = –1).
For this particular choice of the parameters and quantum numbers, we may simply enter

where the keyword free in the procedure Dirac radial component() is used to generate the small
component of a continuum state with (kinetic) energy Ef = 2.072432345 (au) and where most
of the intermediate printout has been suppressed by using a colon to terminate the ﬁrst 5 lines.
Both the energy Ef and the momentum transfer q = 0.01877198124 (au) are easily derived
from the conservation of energy, assuming I = 0.5 (au) as the ionization potential for the 1s
electron of atomic hydrogen. In the last input line, moreover, the procedure Dirac spherical j()
is used to returns the spherical Bessel function jL(qr).

The (direct) numerical computation of the integrals (27–29) is typically reliable but also very
time consuming. For the integral above, for instance, Maple requires about 145 seconds at
a 1 GHz processor. An alternative and (much) faster computation is achieved by using the
analytical expressions for the radial integrals (27–29) in terms of the special hypergeomet-
ric functions [28]. Within the Dirac program, such a (analytical) integration algorithm is
supported by means of the procedure Dirac IJ radial() which can be invoked with the same
parameters as above to determine the I 0

L=1(q; a, b) integral

> Dirac IJ radial(IL0, 0.01877198124, 1, 1, -1, 2.072432345, -1, free):

-0.23633058961153083452 10

-5

Although, of course, the integral is the same for using both, the numerical or analytical
integration scheme (at least up to the 16–th decimal digit), the procedure Dirac IJ radial() is
faster by almost two orders of magnitude when compared to Maple’s numerical integration.
It is also more accurate as found by increasing the number of digits to Digits := 30.

5 Summary and outlook

The Dirac program has been presented to facilitate a fast and consistent access to the basic
elements and properties of the hydrogen–like ions. In its present form, this program consists
out of a set of Maple procedures for the numerical and analytical evaluation of the Coulomb
wave and Green’s functions, both within the nonrelativistic and relativistic framework. Apart
from these functions, moreover, the computation of radial integrals (as they frequently arise
in the evaluation of transition amplitudes for various types operators) is supported by means
of the Dirac program by implementing the analytic formulas.

Of course, the procedures above can be seen also as the technical basis for more advanced
studies concerning the behaviour of the hydrogen–like ions or, more generally, applications of
the atomic shell model. In the future, therefore, several lines are possible (and desirable) for
the further development of the Dirac program. In a ﬁrst step, we want to extent the present
set of procedures towards the interaction of hydrogen–like ions with the radiation ﬁled as it

occurs in the ionization or capture of electrons by high-Z ions or in laser ﬁelds. Examples of
very desirable procedures refer to a simple access to the decay rates, angular distributions, or
to the polarization of the emitted radiation. Having collaborations with the atomic physics
community at GSI and elsewhere for many years, we know that these developments will make
the Dirac package attractive to both, experimental and theoretical investigations on energetic
ion–atom and ion–electron collisions.

We gratefully acknowledge Thorsten Inghoﬀ for valuable suggestions and help with the de-
velopment of the code. This work has been supported by the BMBF in the framework of the
’Verbundforschung im Bereich der Hadronen– und Kernphysik’.

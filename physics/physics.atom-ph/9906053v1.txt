Abstract

Fully quantum treatment explicitly presents the high harmonic generation
as a three-step process: (i) above threshold ionization (ATI) is followed by
(ii) electron propagation in a laser-dressed continuum. Subsequently (iii)
stimulated (or laser assisted) recombination brings the electron back into the
initial state with emission of a high-energy photon. Contributions of all ATI
channels add up coherently. All three stages of the process are described by
simple, mostly analytical expressions that allow a detailed physical interpre-
tation. A very good quantitative agreement with the previous calculations
on the harmonic generation by H− ion is demonstrated, thus supplementing
the conceptual signiﬁcance of the theory with its practical eﬃciency. The
virtue of the present scheme is further supported by a good accord between
the calculations in length and velocity gauges for the high-energy photon.

I. INTRODUCTION

Under the inﬂuence of an intensive electromagnetic ﬁeld an atom can emit electrons and
photons. The number of photons absorbed from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst process generally can
exceed the minimum necessary for ionization resulting in distribution of the photoelectrons
over the above threshold ionization (ATI) channels. The photon production manifests itself
as the harmonics generation (HG) for the incident monochromatic laser radiation. Both ATI
and HG are capable of populating the channels with remarkably high energy, as has recently
been registered in experiments (see, e.g., Ref. [1–5]) and tackled by the theory [6–23] (the
list of references is unavoidably incomplete, for more bibliography see the reviews [24,25]).
An idea that the two processes referred above are interrelated was articulated long ago.
Since in the HG process an active electron ends up in the initial bound state, it is appealing
to represent it as ionization followed by recombination. This mechanism presumes a strong
interaction between the emitted electron and the core that is omitted in the standard Keldysh
[26] model of multiphoton ionization. The importance of this interaction was ﬁrst pointed
out by Kuchiev [28], who predicted several phenomena for which the electron-core interaction
plays a crucial role. The related mechanism was named “atomic antenna”.

Speciﬁcally for HG, the simple relation between this process and ATI was suggested
by Eberly et al [6] but proved to be non-realistic, see below. The hybrid classical-quantum
model due to Corkum [8] (see also the paper by Kulander et al [10]) casts HG as a three-step
process: tunneling ionization and subsequent propagation in the continuum is completed by
recombination. This intuitive model has inﬂuenced many research in experiment and theory.
The simplicity of the model is due to some drastic presumptions. Usually it is emphasized
that the intermediate electron propagation in the laser ﬁeld is described by the Corkum [8]
model classically. Probably less attention is paid to the fact that neither the tunneling ion-
ization through the time-dependent barrier, nor the laser-stimulated recombination receive
a genuine quantum treatment as well. Being successfully applied to the comparison with
some experimental data, the model resorts to such a loosely deﬁned free parameter as the
’transverse spread of the electron wave function’. From the conceptual side the Corkum [8]
model does not appeal to ATI process just because the discrete ATI channels do not appear
within the classical framework. The subsequent theoretical developments were based on
more sophisticated approaches and led to important advancements [11–13,15], but appar-
ently abandoned a perspective to establish a quantitative relation between ATI and HG.
The ATI characteristics merely do not emerge in the papers devoted to HG theory, with
few exceptions [14,16]. For instance, Ref. [20] establishes what the authors think to be ’the
most general formal relation between ionization and high harmonic generation’ that contains
functional derivative of ’the ground state persistence amplitude’ Z but not ATI amplitude.
As the authors recognize, this relation is ’of limited practical use’ since it requires knowledge
of Z for arbitrary electric ﬁeld F(t).

Theoretically HG is governed by the Fourier components in the ﬁeld-dresses wave func-
tion. The proper description of the high-order components is a challenging task for the
theory. Although some important features could be understood in classical calculations,
the signiﬁcance of fully quantum quantitative theory could not be overestimated. The
computer-intensive numerical studies achieved substantial progress [7,9], but the available
computer facilities often limit them to the one-dimensional models [6,21,22]. They could

2

be favorably complemented by analytical studies capable of providing an important physi-
cal insight. However, with the two diﬀerent analytic quantum approaches being developed
recently [12,15], the problem could not yet be considered as closed. For instance, as far
as we know, these two approaches have never been applied to the same system in order to
provide quantitative comparison of their results, albeit the diﬀerences in the formulation
were indicated by Becker et al [15]. The only exception known to us is provided by Ref. [20]
where in Fig. 6 some comparison is presented, albeit not for such a basic characteristics as
HG rates, but for harmonic ellipticity and oﬀset angle that reﬂect rather subtle peculiar-
ities of HG process. For the oﬀset angle a severe disagreement between the two theories
is demonstrated. The lack of comparison looks quite typical to the current state of theory
when the attention is mostly directed towards the qualitative aspects of the problem such
as description of the pattern of emitted harmonic spectrum.

The principal objective of the present study is to derive a fully quantum formulation for
the HG amplitude in terms of the ATI amplitude and the amplitude of electron laser assisted
recombination (LAR) in the laser ﬁeld. Importantly, all the amplitudes are physical, i.e.
no oﬀ-energy-shell entities appear. This circumstance adds to the conceptual appeal of the
present theory its signiﬁcance as a true working tool. In our approach, brieﬂy described in
the Letter to Editor [27], we base on the ideas outlined [28] and later developed in more
detail [29,30] by Kuchiev. We successfully test its eﬃciency by comparison with the bench-
mark calculations by Becker et al [15] for HG by H− ion. It should be emphasized that
we test and achieve quantitative agreement for absolute values of HG rates, in contrast to
many theoretical works which concentrate mostly on the qualitative issues. The quantita-
tive character of our development is further illustrated by comparative calculations within
the dipole-length and dipole-velocity gauges for the emitted high-energy photons: the good
agreement testiﬁes in favor of the method. In the broader perspective it should be empha-
sized that our theoretical technique is directly applicable to other processes of current key
interest, such as multiple ionization by laser radiation or enhanced population of high ATI
channels due to the photoelectron rescattering on the atomic core.

We start (Sec.II) with exposure of the general relations and outline our basic approxima-
tions. In Section III we cast the harmonic generation amplitude as a sum over contributions
coming from diﬀerent ATI channels. The form and interpretation of this representation
becomes particularly transparent when we resort to the adiabatic approximation (Sec.IV).
The general theory is illustrated by the quantitative results in Section V that is followed by
the concluding discussion (Sec.VI).

We consider harmonic generation when the atomic system ends up in the initial state.
Other ﬁnal states are also feasible, but till now this possibility have not been explored neither
in the experiment, nor in the theory. In this case the ﬁnal state tends to Φ(t)a for t

This formula could be compared with Eq. (2.15) in Ref. [20] obtained under presumption
Ψi. Although the general structure is similar, the important diﬀerence lies in the
Ψf ≡
range of temporal integration. In formula (2.8) the ﬁrst term in the right hand side turns
zero for the inversion-invariant (for instance, spherically symmetric) potentials. Physically
the second term describes the process when the high harmonic photon is emitted after the
t′, whereas the third term describes the ’time-reversed’
interaction with the laser ﬁeld, t
event in which the radiation precedes the absorption of laser quanta. We denote the second
and the third terms respectively as d+(t) and d−(t),

The last term in (2.8) includes the eﬀect usually referred to as continuum-continuum tran-
sitions [11,12,20]. In the present outlook it corresponds to the “mixed” picture when a part
of laser photons is absorbed prior to emission of the harmonic followed by absorption of
missing low-energy quanta.

In this paper the continuum-continuum transitions are omitted as a rather standard
approach, apparently assumed originally in Refs. [11,12], albeit never scrutinized. There
exists a simple physical reason why this term should not be important. The absorption of
large number of low-frequency quanta happens when the active electron is well separated
from an atom, see discussion of the role of large distances in [35,36]. In contrast, one should
anticipate that emission of the high-energy quantum occurs when the electron is localized
close to the atom. A transition of the electron from the outer region to the vicinity of
the atom inevitably produces a suppression factor that describes the electron propagation.
Later on it will be considered in detail, see the factor 1/R in (4.14). For a natural sequence
of events, when electron ﬁrst absorbs N laser quanta and then emits the high-harmonic this
suppression factor appears only once. For continuum-continuum transitions the electron has
to go from the outer region into the vicinity of the atom thrice, that induces appearance of
three suppression factors, thus substantially reducing the amplitude. Technically the explicit
calculation of the continuum-continuum contribution means substantially higher level of
diﬃculty, since it contains two Green functions; it is not pursued in the present study. An
alternative, albeit indirect justiﬁcation for omission of continuum-continuum contribution
could be seen in the fact that our calculations of HG rates within this approximation are
in a good quantitative agreement (Sec.V) with the results obtained by Becker et al who
apparently do not rely on it. One more argument in favor of this approximation stems from
the fact that it provides a very good agreement between the results in length and velocity
gauges, as detailed in Sec. V.

Further we presume that the monochromatic laser ﬁeld

is switched on adiabatically at some remote time (F is the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld
strength in the laser wave). In this case one can easily check that d−(t) = d+(
t). After drop-
ping in the right hand side of (2.8) the last term, that describes the continuum-continuum
transitions, we arrive to the formula

−

One should remember that in our calculations according to (2.3) and (2.7) we employed
diﬀerent wave functions Ψi and Ψf . Unfortunately, there is a strong trend in the literature
Ψf that leads to
[6,11,12,15,18,31–34] (to cite only part of references) to presume that Ψi ≡

and, consequently, to the real-valued dipole momentum d(t).

Contrary to this almost universal delusion the expression (2.12) is incorrect for descrip-
tion of harmonic emission by a single atom and the dipole momentum d(t) is not real-
valued, both in the exact formulation (2.8) and within the approximation neglecting the
continuum-continuum transitions (2.11). The recent paper on the uniﬁed theory of har-
monic generation by Becker et al [20] describes two diﬀerent approaches. The calculations
Ψi and lead to the real-valued d(t) [see
of the dipole-moment expectation presume Ψf ≡
Eqs. (2.15) and (2.16) in [20]], whereas the S-matrix approach accounts for the distinction
between Ψf and Ψi and provides a similar formula (2.30) but with a diﬀerent range of tem-
poral integration [cf. our discussion below Eq. (2.8)]. The mentioned formula (2.30) gives
complex-valued results. We agree with the authors comment that the S-matrix approach
is to be employed when the harmonic emission of a single atom is considered; namely this
process is the subject of our present study. However, Ref. [20] as well as Refs. [13,14] carry
out all calculations for the dipole moment expectation presuming that just this quantity is
required as a source term for the integration of the Maxwell equations when the emission
by the medium is considered. We believe that the theory of collective emission should be
ultimately based on the proper description of a single atom process, but further discussion
of this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper.

For the high harmonic generation the ’time-reversed’ process described by d−(t) =
d+(
t), i.e. emission of high harmonics followed by absorption of a large number of the
laser quanta, is strongly suppressed as compared with the “natural” sequence of events rep-
resented by d+(t), i.e. when at ﬁrst a large number of laser quanta is gained and subsequently
one high-frequency photon is emitted. Therefore the further approximation of Eq.(2.11)

−

d(t) = d+(t)

should work well. Below (Sec.V) we demonstrate by explicit calculation of the Fourier
components that indeed the term d−(t) gives negligible contribution.

For monochromatic laser ﬁled (2.10) d(t) is a periodic function of time with the period

T = 2π/ω where ω is the laser frequency. Introducing the Fourier transform

we see that

This stationary picture does not account for the depletion of the initial state by the laser-

states with complex-valued quasienergies; however we do not resort to this complication
below (another method to account for the depletion eﬀects was suggested by Lewenstein et
al [12]).

Thus the problem under consideration is reduced to calculation of the ﬁnite Fourier

transform dN (2.14). One readily notices that

B. Keldysh-type approximation

Our basic approximation is to neglect the eﬀect of the atomic core potential Va in the
time-propagator G(t, t′). A similar assumption underlies the Keldysh [26] model, whose
recent adiabatic modiﬁcation [35–37] gives very reliable quantitative results for photode-
tachment. A useful extension of the Keldysh model accounts for the Coulomb electron-core
interaction [39,40]. The Green function within this approximation is straightforwardly rep-
resented via the standard Volkov wave functions Φp(r, t) [θ(x) = 1, (x > 0); θ(x) = 0,
(x < 0)]:

III. GREEN FUNCTION REPRESENTATION

A. Factorization technique

In the present section we use the theoretical technique elaborated by Kuchiev [29,30]. It
allows us to transform the right hand side of (2.25) to the form convenient for the analysis.
This transformation amounts to some special representation of the time-dependent Green
function, since (2.25) can be considered as its generalized matrix element.

Generally speaking the correct description of the high Fourier components dN represents
a formidable theoretical task. Its numerical implementation via solving the non-stationary
Schr¨odinger equation requires both a supercomputer and exceptional eﬀort. In representa-
tion (2.25) the diﬃculty lies in the strong variation of the integrand as a function of the
time variables t, t′. The application of the asymptotic technique is hindered by the fact
that in expression (2.25) the integration variables are not independent: namely, the limit
of t′-integration depends on t. The crucial simpliﬁcation gained by using the factorization
technique [29] allows us to disentangle the integration variables at a price of introducing an
extra summation. Very importantly, this summation is physically meaningful as it corre-
sponds to the contributions of diﬀerent ATI channels. The integration over the intermediate
momenta q [coming from (2.19)] is carried out in closed form. It should be emphasized that
we do not use the so called pole approximation [43] applied recently by Faisal and Becker
in their model of non-sequential double ionization by laser ﬁeld [41,42].

In order to implement this program we transform the integral over t′ using the identity

The next step is to carry out the integration over q. To this end we note that the wave

Eq.(3.8) is convenient for evaluating the parameters governing the process. First of
all note that integration over the variables r, r′ is localized in the vicinity of the atom.
The characteristic atomic dimensions should be compared with the amplitude F/ω2 of the

An interpretation of formula (3.18) is based on the fact that the integrand is a product
of physically meaningful factors. In order to recognize the ﬁrst of them one should recall

Generally, the number m of photons absorbed is larger than a minimum necessary for the
electron detachment, therefore the process corresponds to the Above Threshold Ionization
(ATI). In the right hand side of (3.19) the index m is implicit. It enters via the absolute value
of the ﬁnal electron momentum p which is subject to the energy conservation constraint

electron quiver energy in the laser ﬁeld. Comparing (3.20) with (3.6) we conﬁrm that Km
is exactly the physical translational electron momentum in the m-th ATI channel.

The second relevant process is that of laser assisted recombination (LAR) when the con-
tinuum electron with the momentum p collides with an atom in the laser ﬁeld. The electron
absorbs some extra laser quanta and goes to the bound state Φa emitting single photon of
frequency Ω. In the Keldysh-type approximation this LAR process has the amplitude

with integer m.

One readily notices that the integrand in (3.18) bears a striking resemblance to the
product of the integrands in (3.19) and (3.21). This allows us to interpret the amplitude
(3.18) as describing the two-step transition: at ﬁrst the electron goes to the laser-ﬁeld
dressed continuum (Volkov) state ΦKm after absorption of m photons; at the second step it
returns to the initial state emitting single photon with the frequency Ω = Nω. Note that
the intermediate momentum p = Km is restricted not only in magnitude (3.6) but also in
direction: according to Eq.(3.16) the vector Km is parallel or anti-parallel to the electric
vector F in the laser wave. The physical implications of this circumstance are discussed in
the next section.

There is an extra factor 1/R(t, t′) in the integrand of (3.18) which prevents complete
separation of integrations in t and t′. In fact its presence is physically well understandable.
Indeed, the deﬁnition of R(t, t′) (3.7) shows that classically it is the distance between the
electron positions at the moments t and t′ with account for the electron wiggling in the laser
ﬁeld. 1/R could be named an expansion factor since in the absence of the laser ﬁeld (F
0)
it describes conventional decrease of the amplitude in a spherical wave as it expands in 3D

). When the laser ﬁeld is operative, the form of the expansion factor
space (
is drastically modiﬁed according to the approximation (3.14). Hence the interpretation of
the expression (3.18) is that the electron ﬁrst is transferred to the m-th ATI channel, then
propagates in space under the inﬂuence of the laser wave and ﬁnally recombines to the initial
state emitting the photon with the frequency Ω. The contribution of each path is labeled
by the number of virtually absorbed photons m. These contributions add up coherently as
shown by Eq.(3.2). For the actual ATI process the momentum Km should be real. The
summation in (3.2) includes also the virtual processes with the imaginary values of Km, but
their contribution is anticipated to be small.

It is worthwhile now to outline equivalent but more convenient representation of ATI and
LAR amplitudes. Bearing in mind the character of r-dependence of Volkov states (2.20)-
(2.21) it is easy to see that the space integration in the formulae (3.19) or (3.21) essentially
reduces to the Fourier transformation. For instance, as shown in much detail by Gribakin
and Kuchiev [35], the ATI amplitude (3.19) is exactly presented as

Before concluding this section it is worthwhile to make an important observation. It is
well known that the Keldysh approximation in the theory of multiphoton ionization is not
gauge invariant. The detailed discussion of this issue can be found in Ref. [44]. Basing on
physical grounds we use the dipole-length form (2.10) for the interaction of the electron with
the laser ﬁeld. As thoroughly discussed earlier [35,36], this gauge stresses large separations
of the active electron from the core where one-electron approximation is better justiﬁed and
one can employ the asymptotic form for the initial-state wave function:

At the present stage of our development the interpretation of (3.18) outlined above should
be considered only as qualitative, since the two time integrations in Eq.(3.18) are not com-
pletely separated due to the factor 1/R0(t, t′). The complete factorization is possible under
additional approximation which actually is not restrictive possessing a broad applicability
range.

IV. ADIABATIC ANALYSIS

A. Adiabatic approach to Above Threshold Ionization

We start with reiterating the basics of the adiabatic approximation in multiphoton de-
tachment theory [35,36] that allows one to carry out analytically integration in expression
(3.19) or (3.23) for the amplitude. It is presumed that the laser frequency ω is small, i.e.
that the number of absorbed photons m is large (the practical applicability of this approach
proves to be very broad, since it gives reasonable results even for m = 2, see, for instance,
Ref. [37]). Then the integrand in (3.19) or (3.23) contains large phase factor exp [iS(t)] and
the integral may be evaluated using the saddle point method [35–38]. The positions of the
saddle points in the complex t plane is deﬁned by equation

or, more explicitly,

Eqs.(4.1) or (4.2) are to be considered together with the energy conservation constraint
Eq.(3.20). Note that according to formula (3.29) the position of the saddle point coincides
with the singularity of the bound-state wave function in the momentum space thus stressing
the importance to describe correctly the long-range behavior of coordinate-space wave func-
tion. The latter could be ensured much more easily than the proper description of the wave
function inside the core region. Therefore the use of the adiabatic approximation and char-
acterization of the bound wave function solely by its asymptotic behavior (3.28) constitutes
a self-consistent approach.

The result of calculations of the amplitude (3.19) in the stationary phase approximation

could be written as a modiﬁcation of formula (25) in Ref. [35]:

B. Adiabatic approach to Harmonic Generation

Although in the harmonic generation matrix element (3.18) the time integration variables
t and t′ are not fully separated, as indicated above, the large phase factor exp [iS(t′)] in t′
integration is the same as in the multiphoton detachment case (3.19). Therefore we can apply
the saddle point approximation to carry out integration over t′. The integration contour is
again shifted upwards in the complex t′ plane; this is the contour
in the formulae (3.17)
and (3.18). The saddle points are deﬁned from the same Eq.(4.2). By solving it we ﬁnd for
the m-dependent saddle points t′

As noted above Eq.(3.18), the summation over σ =

1 indicates that in order
to satisfy the convergence condition (3.4) one has to choose a sign in R0(t, t′) =
cos ωt′) that makes R0(t, t′) > 0. By considering the phase factor in
±
(3.17), we see that the upper sign corresponds to Km parallel to F whereas the lower sign
leads to Km antiparallel to F (without changing
). This looks natural since there is no
reason to prefer one of these directions.

The right hand side of formula (4.6) contains also summation over the saddle points
t′
m µ (for the monochromatic laser ﬁeld two such points are operative being labeled by the
index µ =
1). However, as argued by Kuchiev [29], actually only one saddle point (i.e.
for Km parallel to
one value of the label µ) contributes for each choice of σ =
F and for Km antiparallel to F (as discussed below, this has a simple and clear physical
interpretation). Consequently the double summation over σ and µ is eﬀectively replaced
by a single summation. Moreover, in the latter sum both terms are equal. To see this one
should remember that the preexponential factor 1/R0(t, t′) changes sign depending on the
value of σ =
1. Hence the remaining single summation is equivalently replaced by the
factor of 2. This allows us to ﬁnally rewrite (3.2) using (4.6) as

The adiabatic approximation could be further applied to carry out integration over t in
BN mµ (4.11) or in CN m (3.26) by the saddle point method. However below we do not pursue
this objective and evaluate these integrals numerically.

Eq.(4.12) and its simpliﬁed version (4.14) present the main result of this paper. These
formulae implement the very simple picture of the HG process as consisting of three suc-
cessive steps. First, the electron absorbs m laser photons. The amplitude of this event is
Am µ. In order to contribute to HG the photoelectron has to return to the parent atomic

15

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

core where LAR is solely possible. The amplitude of return is described by the expansion
factor 1/R. It appears explicitly in (4.14), while in (4.12) it is incorporated in the deﬁnition
of the amplitude BN mµ0. The propagation of the electron describes the second phase of the
m photons from
event. At the third step the electron collides with the core absorbing N
the laser ﬁeld and emitting the single high-frequency quantum Ω = Nω as it recombines to
the bound state. This LAR process has the amplitude CN m (3.21). The summation over
m in the total amplitude dN (4.12) takes into account interference of the transitions via
diﬀerent intermediate ATI channels.

−

This appealing physical picture is supplemented by the very simple way to evaluate
numerically all the quantities in (4.12). The amplitude of photoionization A(sp)
m µ0 is calculated
via plain analytical formulae with the validity well testiﬁed before. The LAR process did
not attract much attention in the literature and certainly deserves more study that we hope
to present elsewhere. Here we emphasize only that since CN mµ0 as well as closely related
amplitude BN mµ0 are very similar in structure to the amplitude A(sp)
m µ0, one can hope that
similar methods of evaluation also produce reliable results.

The nontrivial point in the presented picture is the probability for the ATI electron
to return to the core. Intuitively, one could anticipate that such a process is suppressed,
because the most natural behavior for the electron would be simply to leave the atom. The
proper description of the suppression plays substantial role in the theory. According to the
physical image of the ATI process worked out in the adiabatic approach [35], after tunneling
through the time-dependent barrier the ATI electron emerges from under the barrier at
some point which is well separated from the core. As a result this point becomes the source
of an expanding spherical wave. This occurs twice per each cycle of the laser ﬁeld, at the
two moments of time t′
mµ when the source-points lie up and down the ﬁeld F from the core.
The interference of the two spherical waves originating from the two diﬀerent source-points
results in non-trivial patterns in the angular ATI photoelectron distributions obtained from
(4.3)-(4.4) [35] [36] in agreement with the available theoretical and experimental data. The
probability for the ATI electron to return to the core from the source-point is governed by the
expansion factor 1/R and by the direction of propagation. At each of the moments t′
mµ only
one of the two possible directions of Km, labeled in (3.18) by σ =
1, results in the electron
eventually approaching the core. For the opposite direction of Km the electron recedes from
the core and does not come back to recombine. In other words, for each direction of Km only
one of the two saddle points t′
mµ contributes to HG. Since both values of σ give identical
contributions, summation over σ simply gives an extra factor of 2 in (4.12).

C. Choice of the gauge

Calculation of dN according to the formulae (2.2), (2.14), with exact wave function Ψ
might be equivalently carried out in various forms which correspond to diﬀerent choice of
gauge. As soon as the approximations are employed, the theory looses gauge invariance.
Although the length gauge is known to be superior for the description of ATI within the
adiabatic approximation [35], the situation is not that straightforward for the high-energy

binding energy of H− (κ = 0.2354), but replace the true value Aa = 0.75 [46] by √2κ = 0.686
since this corresponds to the zero-range potential model used by Becker et al [15]. Our rates
were multiplied by the extra factor N 2

γ
from the multiphoton regime (γ
1) is covered. Our
major results are shown by open circles in Fig. 1. They are obtained using the expression
(4.12) for dN with the time-integration in BN mµ0 (4.11) carried out numerically. Based on
physical arguments, we extend the summation in (4.12) only over open ATI channels with
the real values of Km. Generally the HG spectrum is known to consist of the initial rapid
decrease, the plateau domain and the rapid fall-oﬀ region. The present theory is designed to
describe the high HG but not the initial decrease, which in the case considered is noticeable
only for one or two lowest harmonics. In the fall-of region, i.e. on the large-N side, our rates
perfectly coincide with those obtained by Becker et al [15] (closed circles in Fig. 1). The
slight diﬀerence that could be hardly distinguished in the plot scale lies within uncertainty
in retrieving data from the small-size plot published in Ref. [15]. Of course, our comparison
is carried out in absolute scale without any ﬁtting or normalization.

The deviations increase as N decreases, but within entire plateau region the agreement
of rates averaged over structures remains good. Remarkably, the positions of numerous dips
and peaks that exist in the plateau region are well reproduced by our calculations, although
there exist some, generally not strong, discrepancies in their magnitudes. The structures
has not yet received a universally accepted physical interpretation in the current literature
with two tentative explanations being available. Becker et al [14] relate these structures
to ATI channel closing whereas Lewenstein et al [49] suggest that it stems from quantum
interferences between the contribution of diﬀerent electron trajectories. Within the present
framework we can say that the origin of these structures lies in the interplay of interfering
contributions of various ATI paths, but their precise description would require an additional
detailed analysis.

Approximation (4.14) with numerical calculation of the integral in CN m (3.26) (open
squares in Fig. 1) somewhat overestimates HG rate, but still retains the structure, though
smoothed.
It is worthwhile to emphasize two circumstances. First, to the best of our
knowledge, we present here almost unique quantitative comparison of HG rates calculated
within diﬀerent theoretical methods, namely, by the present approach and by that developed
by Becker et al. We are aware of only two cases when the quantitative comparison was carried
out previously, one refers to some parameters of HG by elliptically polarized light in Ref. [20]
(see also discussion in the Introduction), the other is comparison between the approach of
Ref. [12] and results of direct numerical integration of the three-dimensional time-dependent
Schr¨odinger approximation [51]. Second, the comparison is presented in the log-scale, as are
the results reported by Becker et al, because it is appropriate both for the physics of the
problem and for the current state of experiment.

In the summation (4.12) over ATI channels (i.e. over m) the coherence is very important,
since large number of terms is comparable in modulus, but have rapidly varying phases.
Many ATI channels contribute to HG for each N. This is in variance with the tentative
conclusion by Eberly et al [6]). The low ATI channels give appreciable contribution even
for quite high harmonics. Only for the highest harmonics considered the contribution of low
ATI channels becomes negligible.

Although the length gauge is known to be superior for the description of ATI within the
adiabatic approximation [35], the situation is not that straightforward for the high-energy
photon. Therefore our calculations for the rates were carried out using both the length and
velocity gauges. For large N the results obtained are very close, see Fig. 2; the dipole-velocity
gauge producing the rates about 10% larger. For smaller N the diﬀerence increases and
manifests rather irregular N-dependence. However, even in the most unfavorable situation
the ratio of the length-form to velocity-form results deviates from 1 not more than by 50%,
which is rather reasonable, bearing in mind the multiphoton nature of the process.

phase ΦN with the intensity I: as I increases by an order of magnitude the phase changes by
about 10π (for N = 9) or 15π (for N = 11). The dependence of phase on I looks most simple

HG rate manifests spikes (see Fig. 3a, where the spikes are slightly smoothed due to ﬁnite
step over I used in plotting) at the intensities Im that correspond to the threshold of m-th
ATI channels, that is closed for I > Im due to ponderomotive potential F 2/(4ω2)).

whereas for d−

we show in Fig. 4 the ratio

of intense laser ﬁeld.

VI. CONCLUSION

The major result of this paper is a quantum mechanical description of the high-harmonic
generation problem as a three-step process. In the ﬁrst step the atomic electron absorbs
several laser quanta and populates some ATI channel. Secondly, the electron propagates in
the laser ﬁeld back to the atomic core. The third step is the laser-induced recombination
when the high harmonic photon is emitted. This mechanism is nothing more but interpre-
tation of our principal formulae (4.12), (4.14) derived quantum mechanically with minimal
approximations and without resort to any classical or intuitive arguments. The distinctive
feature of our formulae (4.12), (4.14) is that they include only genuine amplitudes of the
three constituent processes, i.e. each amplitude describes true physical fully accomplished
process, as HG, ATI or LAR. Here lies a crucial diﬀerence between our results and those of
previous authors [12] (see also Introduction) who discussed mathematical structure of the
matrix elements or integrals considered in their approach in terms of three-step mechanism
but failed to present HG amplitude via amplitudes of physically observable accomplished
ATI and LAR processes. Even in a more broad context this is a rare and remarkable situa-
tion when a complicated process is reduced essentially exactly to the sum over all possible
paths with every path described as a sequence of real, fully accomplished physical processes.
This conceptual simplicity arises due to multiphoton, adiabatic nature of HG process.

With all three constituent amplitudes available from analytical formulae or simple nu-
merical calculations our theory promises to be an eﬃcient practical tool. This hope is
supported by good agreement of our quantitative results for HG by H− ion with the previ-
ous calculations by Becker et al [15] in a wide range of laser intensities and frequencies of
the emitted quantum. As the simplest example of possible future extensions we note only
that our approach can be straightforwardly applied to negative ions with the outer electron
having non-zero orbital momentum, such as halogen ions. These species could be easier
accessible for the experimental studies.

The structure of the formulae (4.12), (4.14) is so simple that it is tempting to suggest
that they will work well if one substitutes in them ATI or LAR amplitudes obtained in
some approximations other than those used in the derivation above. For instance, if ATI
amplitude more accurate than that given by the Keldysh approximation is available from

19

some theory, one can employ it for HG calculations via (4.12), (4.14). This gives a hope to
relatively simply improve account for the electron rescattering eﬀects in the HG theory.

The distinctive feature of the present theory of HG is the use of the representation based
on the discrete set of ATI channels. To the best of our knowledge this simple and apparently
straightforward idea has not been exploited before. It would be underestimate to consider it
merely as a detail of theoretical technique. Indeed, if one pursues the objective of the most
direct and far-reaching quantum implementation of the three-step mechanism of HG, then
the use of ATI channel representation becomes an unavoidable and crucial point. Otherwise,
if the amplitudes of ATI do not appear in the theoretical scheme, HG cannot be properly
described as a three-step process.

In this paper we do not discuss qualitative features of HG spectra, such as extension of
plateau domain etc. Detailed discussion of these issues could be found in other publications
[8,11,12], in particular in the paper by Becker et al [15] whose results for HG by H− ion
we reproduce closely within our theory. This implies that the analysis of the numerical
[15] is fully applicable in our case. Concerning the
results carried out by Becker et al
mechanisms and physical interpretation of HG spectra, the present theory, hopefully, can
add more to our understanding. However, the related analysis requires further theoretical
developments which would overburden the present, already quite a long paper. We hope
to present these subsequent developments elsewhere.
In a broader perspective, one can
expect that modiﬁcations of our approach could be applied to a variety of processes such as
population of high ATI channels and multiple ionization of atoms.

As a summary, the three-step mechanism of the harmonic generation is ultimately justi-
ﬁed. The theory is quantitatively reliable and easy to apply. It gives an important physical
insight being a particular realization of the general atomic antenna mechanism.

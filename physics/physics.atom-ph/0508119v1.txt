Mass Dependence of Ultracold Three-Body Collision Rates

We show that many aspects of ultracold three-body collisions can be controlled by choosing the
mass ratio between the collision partners. In the ultracold regime, the scattering length dependence
of the three-body rates can be substantially modiﬁed from the equal mass results. We demonstrate
that the only non-trivial mass dependence is due solely to Eﬁmov physics. We have determined
the mass dependence of the three-body collision rates for all heteronuclear systems relevant for
two-component atomic gases with resonant s-wave interspecies interactions, which includes only
three-body systems with two identical bosons or two identical fermions.

The achievement of quantum degeneracy in ultracold
gases with diﬀerent atomic species [1] has driven exper-
imental studies of several novel phenomena. The ob-
servation of interspecies Feshbach resonances in boson-
fermion mixtures [2] allows considerable ﬂexibility for ex-
ploring new regimes by controlling the interspecies inter-
actions. Boson-mediated Cooper pairing [3], for instance,
can substantially increase the critical temperature for a
phase transition to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS)
regime. The collapse of the fermionic component as
well as the phase separation of both components can
be studied [4] along with the creation of ultracold po-
lar molecules [5]. It is worth noting that heteronuclear
boson-fermion molecules are composite fermions which
allows a new type of crossover between an atomic Bose-
Einstein condensate and a molecular Fermi-type super-
ﬂuidity [6]. Heteronuclear boson-boson and fermion-
fermion mixtures have also been studied [7], but no Fesh-
bach resonances have yet been reported.

The magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of the hyperﬁne states
is the key to controlling the interatomic interactions in
ultracold gases. By applying an external magnetic ﬁeld
near a diatomic Feshbach resonance, the s-wave scatter-
ing length a, which characterizes the low-energy inter-
atomic interactions, can take any value from the weakly
(a → 0) to the strongly (|a| → ∞) interacting limits.
Even though two-body loss processes can usually be min-
imized by using resonances in the lowest hyperﬁne states,
three-body loss processes can still be substantial. Fortu-
nately, near the resonance, when |a| ≫ r0 (with r0 being
the characteristic range of the interatomic interactions)
processes such as vibrational relaxation, X+X ∗
2 → X+X2,
three-body recombination, X + X + X → X + X ∗
2 , and
collision-induced dissociation, X + X ∗
2 → X + X + X, no
longer depend on the details of the interactions and uni-
versal predictions can be made.

Recent experiments have underscored the importance
of knowing the a dependence of three-body rates in or-
der to determine the atomic and molecular lifetimes. In
fact, three-body losses have been used to locate Fesh-
bach resonances [2] and to create ultracold molecules
[8]. While general results for threshold [9] and scattering

length scaling laws of three-body equal mass systems [10]
have been obtained, however, there are no similarly gen-
eral scaling laws for heteronuclear systems. The speciﬁc
case of recombination in a two-component Fermi gas has
been investigated, though, and found to scale as a6 for
a > 0, and minima were predicted as a function of the
mass ratio between the collision partners [11].

In this Letter we demonstrate that the mass ratio has
a large impact on ultracold three-body collisional losses,
allowing a certain degree of control. Using the simple
physical picture developed in Ref. [10], extended to in-
clude heteronuclear systems, we have determined that
the scattering length scaling laws can diﬀer substantially
from the equal mass results [10]. For instance, in a system
with two identical fermions that are much heavier than
the third atom, relaxation of weakly bound heteronu-
clear molecules scales approximately as a−7 — an even
stronger suppression than the a−3.33 scaling found when
all three atoms have equal mass [10, 12]. This scaling was
derived in Ref. [12] to explain the long molecular lifetimes
observed experimentally for molecules formed of fermions
in diﬀerent spin states. It was their long lifetimes that
made further experiments with these molecules feasible
[8, 13]. The stronger suppression found here might open
other experimental avenues.

In our picture, the mass dependence enters via the
three-body eﬀective potentials and is associated with Eﬁ-
mov physics [14]. In fact, we demonstrate here that the
only non-trivial mass dependence is due solely to Eﬁmov
physics. We determine the mass dependence of the col-
lision rates for three-body systems relevant to all two-
component atomic gases with resonant interspecies s-
wave interactions, which includes systems with two iden-
tical bosons or two identical fermions.

For short-range two-body interactions, the ultracold
behavior of three-body systems can be derived from
three-body eﬀective potentials and couplings [10] which,
in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, are deter-
mined from the adiabatic equation [15],

Had(R, Ω)Φν (R; Ω) = Uν(R)Φν(R; Ω).

(1)

This equation is obtained from the full Schr¨odinger equa-

tion by ﬁxing the hyperradius R, leaving only dynam-
ics in the hyperangles Ω through Had. By expanding
the total wave function on the adiabatic basis Φν, the
Schr¨odinger equation (in atomic units) is reduced to:

2µ

dR2 + Wν (cid:21)

(cid:20)

Fν +

Vνν′ Fν′ = EFν ,

(2)

Xν′6=ν

where E is the total energy, Fν is the hyperradial wave
function, and ν is a collective index that represents
all quantum numbers necessary to label each channel.
In the present case, the three-body reduced mass is
µ=m/
δ(δ + 2) where m is the mass of the distinguish-
able particle and δ is the ratio of the diﬀerent atom mass
to the identical atom mass. This equation describes the
collective radial motion under the inﬂuence of the eﬀec-
tive potential Wν as well as any inelastic transitions con-
trolled by the nonadiabatic couplings Vνν′ .

p

In the limit |a| ≫ r0 the eﬀective potentials Wν depend
crucially on Eﬁmov physics [10, 14]. In Ref. [10], we de-
scribed a scheme that uses this fact to classify all equal-
mass three-body systems with resonant s-wave pairwise
interactions. In this scheme, each system falls into one
of two categories: those with an attractive dipole (R−2)
potential in the range r0 ≪ R ≪ |a| and those only with
repulsive dipole potentials. Which category a particu-
lar system falls into depends on its symmetry J π (total
angular momentum J and parity π) and the identical
particle permutational symmetry, i.e., whether they are
bosons or fermions. For heteronuclear systems, this ba-
sic classiﬁcation scheme still holds, and the extension of
the analysis of the three-body rates requires only slight
modiﬁcations which, in turn, come almost entirely from
the δ dependence of the dipole potential strengths.

For each category, there are three distinct regions in R
that characterize the eﬀective potentials (for a schematic
picture, see Fig. 1 in Ref. [10]): R . r0, r0≪R≪|aδ|,
δ(δ + 2)/(δ + 1)]1/2a. Replac-
and R≫|aδ| where aδ=[
ing a by aδ in these deﬁnitions is the ﬁrst mass-dependent
modiﬁcation of our previous analysis. In the asymptotic
region, R≫|aδ|, the potentials can be derived analyti-
cally [16]. They are associated with molecular chan-
nels, which represent atom-molecule scattering, and with
three-body continuum channels, which represent colli-
sions of three free atoms, and are given respectively by

continuum channels [Eq. (3)] are modiﬁed due to Eﬁmov

ﬁrst category, an attractive dipole potential occurs in the
highest vibrationally excited s-wave molecular channel
for a > 0 and in the lowest continuum channel for a < 0.
The potentials for all higher-lying channels are repulsive.
These potentials are conveniently parametrized by the
coeﬃcients s0 and sν:

Wν (R) = −

and Wν (R) =

(4)

In the second category, the potentials for the weakly
bound molecular channel and the continuum channels are
repulsive and parametrized by coeﬃcients p0 and pν:

Wν(R) =

and Wν(R) =

(5)

In both categories, however, deeply bound molecular
channels are essentially independent of a. In the above
equations, the coeﬃcients s0, sν, p0, and pν depend on
the number of resonant pairs, the number of identical
particles, and the mass ratio δ between collision partners
[14]. For R . r0, the potentials depend on the details
of the interatomic interactions and can lead to resonance
eﬀects due to three-body shape or Feshbach resonances.
In the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, inelas-
tic transitions at ultracold temperatures proceed via
tunneling in the initial collision channel to where the
coupling Vνν′ peaks — the coupling, of course, drives
the transition. We have previously shown that a sim-
ple WKB approximation to the tunneling probability
through the potentials given by Eqs. (3)-(5) is suﬃcient
to determine both the threshold and the scattering length
scaling laws for equal mass three-body collisions [10]. For
heteronuclear systems, aδ, s0, sν, p0, and pν generate the
only non-trivial mass dependence in the three-body rates
and follow directly from Eﬁmov’s analysis.

The mass dependence of s0 and p0 can substantially
modify the a dependence of the three-body rates. The
coeﬃcients sν and pν , however, do not aﬀect the scaling
laws. Figure 1 shows s0 and p0 for systems with two
identical bosons (BBX, δ=mX/mB) and with two iden-
tical fermions (F F X, δ=mX /mF ). These coeﬃcients are
determined analytically following Ref. [14] after proper
symmetrization. It is important to notice that for J > 0
the eﬀective potentials can change from attractive to re-
pulsive and vice-versa, changing the category in which
the system is classiﬁed, and thus modifying its collisional
properties. It happens, for instance, for 2+ BBX sys-
tems at δc ≈ 0.0259 [Fig. 1(a)] and for 1− F F X systems
at δc ≈ 0.0735 [Fig. 1(b)].

FIG. 1: Mass dependence of s0 and p0, for (a) two identical
boson and (b) two identical fermion systems.

For bosonic systems BBX, the dominant contribution
for relaxation and recombination is J π = 0+ with l = 0
and λ = 0, and is described by Eqs. (6)-(7) due to the
presence of an attractive dipole potential. In this case,
the variations of s0 with δ [Fig. 1(a)] changes the number
of Eﬁmov states. These variations manifest themselves
in the three-body rates through the locations of the min-
ima and peaks in Eqs. (6)-(7). We note that the mass
dependence in this case does not modify the scaling laws.
In contrast, for fermionic systems F F X, the power law
behavior does change with mass for the dominant contri-
butions to relaxation (J π = 0+ with l = 0) and recombi-
nation (J π = 1− with λ = 1). These changes follow from
the mass dependence of the repulsive dipole potential due
to p0 [Fig. 1(b)] combined with Eqs. (8)-(9). It follows
that relaxation for F X + F collisions scales as a1−2p0 for

3

a > 0 and is suppressed for all δ since 2≤p0≤4 [Fig. 1(b)],
approaching its greatest suppression, a−7, as δ → 0 and
its least, a−3, as δ → ∞. Suppression of F X + F colli-
sions can thus be much stronger than a−3.33, found for
δ = 1 F F ′ + F collisions of fermionic atoms in diﬀer-
ent spin states [10, 12]. Extremely long-lived heteronu-
clear molecules in ultracold boson-fermion and fermion-
fermion mixtures might thus be possible. The modiﬁca-
tions to the recombination scaling law occurs for a < 0
and δ ≥ 0.0735 where it scales as a6−2p0 with 0 ≤ p0 ≤ 2
[Fig. 1(b)], otherwise it scales as a6, leading to an asym-
metry between a > 0 and a < 0. The strongest asym-
metry is obtained when δ → ∞, where recombination
scales as a6 and |a|2, respectively, so that greater colli-
sional stability against recombination might be expected
for a < 0.

As mentioned above, recombination for F F X systems
with δ ≥ 0.0735 was studied in Ref. [11] and found to
scale as a6 for a > 0 which agrees with our prediction. It
was also predicted that the recombination rate oscillates
as a function of δ with zeros at δ = 0.0735, 0.1160, and
as δ → ∞ (note that the mass ratio in [11] is 1/δ). These
zeros were ascribed to a decoupling of the three-body
continuum and bound channels [11], leading to elastic
scattering only, and have also been interpreted as inter-
ference eﬀects [17]. In our formulation, however, no such
zeros are predicted. In fact, in this range of δ, the poten-
tials for both continuum and bound channels, Eq. (5), are
repulsive and interference eﬀects are expected to be sup-
pressed by tunneling. Further, we have noticed through
representative numerical calculations that the continuum
and bound channels never decouple and that the nona-
diabatic coupling peaks at R ≈ r0 and R ≈ a, in accord
with our model [10]. While we have observed minima in
our calculations, they do not correspond to the minima
discussed in Ref. [11]. They are most likely a consequence
of using a two-body potential with ﬁnite a, and we expect
them to disappear in the limit a → ∞ considered in [11].
Preliminary numerical results support this expectation.
Table I summarizes the threshold and scattering length
scaling laws for the three-body rates, including dissoci-
ation D3. The three dominant partial waves (as deter-
mined by their energy dependence) are shown for each
process. The table thus indicates the terms expected to
be important for ﬁnite energies or |a| → ∞. For BBX
systems, these contributions are not expected to be im-
portant for relaxation with a > 0 or recombination with
a < 0. For F F X systems, however, the higher partial
waves are comparatively more important.

In two-component ultracold atomic gases with reso-
nant interspecies interactions, the important three-body
processes are those that involve both atomic species, as-
suming that intraspecies interactions are not resonant.
In this case, there are only two relevant systems and the
competition between the collision rates for each system as
well as the density of each species determines the atomic

fects the features due to Eﬁmov physics but leaves the
dominant scattering length scaling laws unchanged. In
fermionic systems, however, the mass dependence modi-
ﬁes the scattering length scaling laws substantially from
the equal mass results. The stronger suppression found
for relaxation of weakly bound heteronuclear molecules in
boson-fermion mixtures, suggests the possibility of long-
lived heteronuclear fermionic molecules.

and molecular lifetimes. In boson-fermion mixtures, for
instance, relaxation for BF + F collisions decreases with
a while for BF + B it increases. In this case, if all bosons
are bound in BF molecules, the molecules are expected
to be long-lived. Otherwise, the molecules will be rapidly
quenched by collisions with the bosonic atoms.

Vibrational relaxation, as we have shown, can be con-
trolled by choosing the atomic species according to their
mass and consequently the molecular lifetime can be sub-
stantially modiﬁed. We show in Table II the suppression
predicted for BF + F collisions of commonly used alkali
atoms. The table includes systems used in recent ex-
periments: 23Na-6Li and 87Rb-40K [2], as well as 7Li-6Li
[6]. We have included H due to the prospects for using
it for sympathetic cooling [18]. Molecule-molecule colli-
sions also contribute to the molecular lifetime [12], but
in boson-fermion mixtures the molecules are composite
fermions so that only p-wave molecule-molecule collisions
occur. In this case, molecule-molecule collisions are sup-
pressed for ultracold temperatures, and atom-molecule
collisions are expected to be dominant.

Abstract. We calculate energies and hyperﬁne structure constants A and B for
low-lying levels of 173Yb. The latter is treated as a two-electron atom. To account
for valence-valence correlations the conﬁguration interaction method is used.
Valence-core correlations are accounted for within the many-body perturbation
theory which is used to construct eﬀective two-electron operators in the valence
space.

1. Introduction

Two years ago a method for calculation of the low-lying energy levels of many-
electron atoms was proposed [1]. Calculations for Tl [1], Ca, Sr, Ba and Yb [2]
and Ba [3] conﬁrmed its eﬀectiveness. Later this method was generalized for other
observables, such as hyperﬁne structure (HFS) constants [4] and polarizabilities [5].
Within this method valence-valence correlations are treated non-perturbatively, while
core-valence and core-core correlations are treated within the many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT).

Here we report calculations for the HFS constants of the low-lying levels of
ytterbium. Our interest to this atom is caused in part by an extremely large parity
nonconserving (PNC) amplitude for the 1S0 (6s2) → 3D1 (5d6s) transition.
It was
ﬁrst suggested by DeMille [6] and later conﬁrmed in [7, 8], that this amplitude is
approximately 100 times larger than PNC amplitude for the 6s → 7s transition in Cs
and 10 times larger than that for the 6p → 7p transition in Tl. This makes Yb a very
promising candidate for the future PNC experiment. Therefore, an accurate atomic
calculations for Yb are needed. Moreover, it is important to have a reliable estimate
of the accuracy of such calculations. PNC amplitude is very sensitive to the behavior
of the wave function in the vicinity of the nucleus. Of course, the same applies to HFS
constants. That makes HFS calculations very important for the future analysis of the
theoretical accuracy for the PNC amplitude.

We also have a more general interest in ytterbium as an atom with the relatively
shallow 4f core shell. For such an atom it is not obvious at all, that core-valence
correlations can be treated by means of the MBPT. In the earlier paper [2] we have

shown that the method works for the low-lying energy levels and here we extend our
analysis to the HFS constants. We also show here, that with some caution it is possible
to calculate HFS constants of the levels, which lie above the core excitation threshold.
In the next section of the paper we deﬁne eﬀective operators for the valence
electrons and brieﬂy describe how MBPT can be used to calculate these operators
(for more details see [1, 4]).
In section 3 we give some details of the calculations
followed by the discussion of the results in section 4.

2. Eﬀective operators for valence electrons

At present there are several methods of calculations for many-electron atoms.
For atoms with one electron above a closed core a conventional MBPT is quite
eﬀective (see, for example, [9]). For atoms with several valence electrons the multi
conﬁgurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method is often used [10]. Lately the coupled-
claster method became very popular [11, 12, 13]. All these methods were used to
calculate HFS constants of diﬀerent atoms (see, for example, [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]).
The most complicated problem in precise atomic calculations is associated
with the necessity to treat valence-valence correlations, core-valence, and core-core
correlations. The former are usually too strong to be treated perturbatively, while
other types of correlations can not be eﬀectively treated within non-perturbative
techniques, such as MCHF or CI method.

Therefore, it is natural to try to combine MBPT with one of the non-perturbative
methods.
In [1] it was suggested to use MBPT in order to construct an eﬀective
Hamiltonian for valence electrons. After that, Schr¨odinger equation for valence
electrons is solved within CI approach. That allows to ﬁnd the low-lying energy levels.
In order to calculate other atomic observables, one need to construct corresponding
eﬀective operators for valence electrons [4]. The latter eﬀectively account for the core-
valence and core-core correlation, which are of particular importance for such singular
operators as HFS ones.

Suppose, that we are interested in atomic levels with energies Ei − E0 < ε, where
E0 is the ground state energy. In the ﬁrst approximation we can assume that inner
electrons with the Hartree-Fock energies |εn| ≫ ε form the core, which is described
by the wave function

Ψcore = (Nc!)
hDFφn = εnφn,

−1/2det(φ1, φ2, . . . φNc ),

where hDF is the Dirac-Fock operator, and Nc is the number of core electrons. Note,
that this operator can include the ﬁeld of some valence electrons as well. For example,
it is natural to consider Yb as a two-electron atom with the core [1s2 . . . 4f 14],
and operator hDF can be calculated for conﬁguration 1s2 . . . 4f 146s2 (so called, V N -
approximation, N is the number of electrons in the atom).

Let us say that many-electron wave function Ψ belongs to the valence subspace if
core electrons are in the state (1). We will denote projector operator on this subspace
by P . Then, operator Q = 1 − P will project on the subspace for which at least one
of the core electrons is excited to one of the states φn with n > Nc.

One can show [1], that Schr¨odinger equation

HΨ = EΨ

(1)
(2)

(3)

Calculation of hyperﬁne structure constants for ytterbium

is equivalent to the following equation in the P -subspace for the function Φ = P Ψ:

(P HP + Σ(E)) Φ = EΦ,

P,
Σ(E) = P V

(4)
(5)
where V ′ is the operator of the residual Coulomb interaction and RQ(E) is the Green’s
function in Q-subspace:

Operator H0 is deﬁned in terms of one-electron operator (2):

H0 =

The constant W in the right hand side of this equation is introduced to compensate
the double counting of the two-electron interaction in the sum. It can be ﬁxed, for
example, by the requirement:

which implies, that

hΨcore|H0|Ψcorei = hΨcore|H|Ψcorei,

W = W0 ≡

εi − hΨcore|H|Ψcorei.

It is also possible to use W as a free parameter to match the energy spectrum. This
subject is discussed in more details elsewhere [20].

Equations (3) — (7) yield:

Ψ = (P + RQ(E)V

P ) Φ,

′

The orthonormality condition hΨi|Ψki = δi,k is approximately equivalent to the
following condition for Φ:

hΦi|1 − ∂EΣ( ¯E)|Φki ≈ δi,k,

(12)
where ¯E ≈ (Ei + Ek)/2. Note, that only the last of equations (4) — (12) is
approximate.

The operator in the left hand side of equation (4) plays the role of an
eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ . Equations (4) — (7) allow to construct it with the
help of conventional diagrammatic technique [1, 2], which is based on the following
representation of the Green’s function:

E − QH0Q

RQ(E) = R0

Q(E) = Q

In particular, if we restrict ourselves to the second order MBPT, we have to replace
RQ(E) in the right hand side of (5) by R0

Q(E).
Suppose now, that we know solutions of Equation (4) and we want to use them

to calculate an observable a, which is associated with one-electron operator A:

Let us deﬁne eﬀective operator Aeﬀ so, that

a = hΨ|A|Ψi.

a = hΦ|Aeﬀ |Φi.

Note, that only the ﬁrst order MBPT corrections are completely included in (17).
Some second order corrections, the, so-called, structural radiation, as well as many
higher-order corrections, are omitted. Nevertheless, this approximation accounts for
several most important MBPT corrections to all orders. Diagrammatic representation
of Equation (17) can be found in [4].

3. Hyperﬁne structure calculations

We use basis representation for diagrams for eﬀective Hamiltonian and for eﬀective
HFS operators. That implies that all sums over intermediate states run over some
ﬁnite set of one-electron states. The latter should eﬀectively account for both discrete
and continuous part of the spectrum of Dirac-Fock operator (2).

In this calculation basis set included 167 four-component orbitals: 1−23s, 2−22p,
3 − 22d, 4 − 15f , 5 − 15g and 6 − 13h. Core orbitals as well as valence orbitals
6s, 7s, 6p, 7p, and 5d, 6d were obtained by solving Dirac-Fock equations for appropriate
conﬁgurations, while higher virtual orbitals were formed, as described in [21, 22, 1, 4].
After that operator (2) was diagonalized in order to have quasi-Dirack-Fock basis set.
This basis set was used to solve RPA equations for HFS operators and to calculate
diagrams for eﬀective Hamiltonian and eﬀective HFS operators. After that, the
solution of Equation (4) was found in the CI approximation. On this stage it was
possible to truncate our basis set to 7 − 15s, 6 − 15p, 5 − 14d, 5 − 10f and 5 − 7g
orbitals. We made complete CI on this shorter basis set.

We calculated eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ in the second order of MBPT. That
means, that zero order approximation (14) for the Green’s function was used in
(5). The choice of the constant W suggested by Equation (10) resulted in some
underestimation of the binding energy for levels of the conﬁguration 5d6s and for 1P o
1
level of the conﬁguration 6s6p. For these levels W = W0 + 0.4 au was used. Our
ﬁnal results for the ground state are given in table 1 and for several low-lying levels
in table 2.

On the next stage we used corresponding wave functions to calculate HFS
constants. These calculations are similar to those of the papers [4] and [5]. Results are
given in tables 3 and 4. In analysis of the theoretical accuracy, which is done in the next
section, it is very important to know the scale of diﬀerent contributions to the ﬁnal
answer. Therefore, in tables 3 and 4 we give results of the Dirac-Fock calculation, of
the conventional two-electron CI and of the two-electron CI with eﬀective Hamiltonian.
Final values include eﬀective operator corrections (17) and normalization correction
(12). The latter usually decreases the answer by 1%–2%.

4. Discussion

We have pointed out above, that the eﬀective Hamiltonian can be safely used only
for the energy levels below the core excitation threshold. For Yb this threshold lies
at 23189 cm−1 above the ground state and many of the levels from the table 2 lie
higher. Nevertheless, theoretical spectrum is quite good up to the level 1Po
1(6s7p),
which appears 1634 cm−1 below its experimental position. This huge discrepancy can

Calculation of hyperﬁne structure constants for ytterbium

be attributed to interaction with the J = 1 level at 38422 cm−1, which is supposed to
belong to the conﬁguration 4f 135d26s [23]. This level can also interact with 3Po
1(6s7p),
what makes calculations for this level less reliable. For other levels from the table 2
there are no close levels with the same J and the same parity, which correspond to
the excitations from the 4f -shell.

The perturber levels, discussed above, correspond to the poles of the Green’s
function RQ(E) and, thus, to the poles of the operator Σ(E). As long as we use
approximate Green’s function (14) instead of the exact one, the poles of Σ(E) are
shifted from the physical poles.
In order to use eﬀective Hamiltonian, we have to
keep far enough from the poles of the exact Green’s function and from the poles of
the approximate Green’s function. As we go further up above the core excitation
threshold, both sets of poles become denser. For this reason, it is hardly possible to
use eﬀective operator technique there.

Let us now proceed to the calculations of HFS constants presented in the tables 3
and 4.
In these tables the ﬁrst two rows correspond to the non-perturbative part
of the calculation, while two lower rows include MPBT corrections associated with
the eﬀective Hamiltonian and the eﬀective HFS operators. One can see, that average
MBPT contribution is about 30% for magnetic constant A and about 40% for electric
quadrupole constant B. Thus, theoretical accuracy for the constant A is normally
higher. Indeed, we have neglected higher order corrections to the eﬀective Hamiltonian
and to the eﬀective HFS operators, that can be justiﬁed only if MBPT corrections are
small.

For 6 levels (3D2 (5d6s), 3D3 (5d6s), 3S1 (6s7s), 3D1 (6s6d), 3D3 (6s6d), and
3Po
2 (6s7p)) MBPT corrections to the constant A are less than 25%. For all these
levels the diﬀerence between the theory and experiment is within 3%. For the constant
B the smallest MBPT corrections (about 35%) correspond to levels 3D1 (6s6d) and
3Po
1 (6s6p), where we have agreement with the experiment within 2%. Constant B for
3S1 (6s7s)- state diﬀers from zero only because of the conﬁguration interaction.

On the other hand, when MBPT corrections are 40% or more, the accuracy of
the theory becomes uncertain. The most striking discrepancy with the experiment
takes place for levels 1D2 (5d6s), 3D2 (6s6d) and 1Po
1 (6s6p). For all of them MBPT
corrections appear to be 40%–50%.

The only exception of this rule is the level 3Po

1 (6s7p), where MBPT corrections
for both constants are about 30%, but even the sign of the constant B diﬀers from
the experiment. As we pointed out above, this level can interact with the perturber
level 4f 135d26s(J = 1), which is located at 38422 cm−1. Constant B for this level is
relatively small and even small admixture of the perturber can result in the change of
its sign, while the larger constant A should be less aﬀected by such a mixing.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we have checked applicability of the CI+MBPT method for ytterbium.
The ﬁrst core excitation here lies only 23189 cm−1 above the ground state, which
seems to restrict us to only few lowest levels. Actually, the method works quite well
up to 38930 cm−1, where the ﬁrst signiﬁcantly perturbed level arise.

When the method is used for calculations of HFS constants, the accuracy of
calculations depends on the scale of MBPT corrections. When total MBPT correction
contributes less than 25% to the value of the constant, the accuracy appears to be
better than 3%. On the contrary, when MBPT corrections account for more than

Calculation of hyperﬁne structure constants for ytterbium

40% of the theoretical value, the accuracy becomes uncertain. In this case one can
use MBPT correction only as a rough estimate of the theoretical error. We expect,
that similar relation holds for other one-electron operators as well.

For the studied levels of Yb the average MBPT correction is approximately 30%
for the constant A and 40% for the constant B. Therefore, precision calculations of
the constant A are possible for the majority of levels, while precision calculations of
the constant B are possible only as exception.

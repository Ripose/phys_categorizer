Abstract

The ﬁrst Born diﬀerential cross section for Mott scattering of a Dirac-Volkov elec-
tron is reviewed. The expression (26) derived by Szymanowski et al. [Physical Review
A 56, 3846 (1997)] is corrected. In particular, we disagree with the expression of
they obtained and we give the exact coeﬃcients multiplying the various Bessel functions
(cid:17)
appearing in the scattering diﬀerential cross section. Comparison of our numerical calcu-
lations with those of Szymanowski et al. shows qualitative and quantitative diﬀerences
when the incoming total electron energy and the electric ﬁeld strength are increased
particularly in the direction of the laser propagation.

1 Introduction

In a pioneering paper, Szymanowski et al.

[1] have studied the Mott scattering process in a

strong laser ﬁeld. The main purpose was to show that the modiﬁcations of the Mott scattering

diﬀerential cross section for the scattering of an electron by the Coulomb potential of a nu-

cleus in the presence of a strong laser ﬁeld, can yield interesting physical insights concerning

the importance and the signatures of the relativistic eﬀects. Their spin dependent relativistic

description of Mott scattering permits to distinguish between kinematics and spin-orbit cou-

pling eﬀects. They have compared the results of a calculation of the ﬁrst Born diﬀerential

cross section for the Coulomb scattering of the Dirac-Volkov electrons dressed by a circularly

polarized laser ﬁeld to the ﬁrst Born cross section for the Coulomb scattering of spinless Klein-

Gordon particles and also to the non relativistic Schr¨odinger-Volkov treatment. The aim of

this comment is to provide the correct expression for the ﬁrst-Born diﬀerential cross sections

corresponding to the Coulomb scattering of the Dirac-Volkov electrons. On the one hand,

we show that the terms proportional to sin(2φ0) are missing in [1], where φ0 is the phase
stemming from the expression of the circularly polarized electromagnetic ﬁeld. The claim of

[1] that they vanish is not true. These terms do not depend on the chosen description of the

circular polarization in cartesian components. On the other hand, we perform the calculations

with some details and throughout this work, we use atomic units (¯h = e = m = 1) where m

denotes the electron mass. The abbreviation DCS stands for the diﬀerential cross section.

The organization of this paper is as follows : in Section 2, we establish the expression of the

S-matrix transition amplitude as well as the formal expression of scattering DCS. In Section

3, we give a detailed account on the various trace calculations and show that indeed there is

a missing term proportional to sin(2φ0) that is not equal to zero. This term as well as a term
and multiply the product Js+1(z)Js−1(z), where
proportional to cos(2φ0) contribute to
Js(z) is an ordinary Bessel function of argument z and index s. The argument z appearing
in the above mentioned product will be deﬁned later. Then, we carry out the derivation of

dσ
dΩ

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

the correct expression of the scattering DCS associated to the exchange of a given number

of laser photons.

In section 4, we give some estimates of the numerical signiﬁcance of our

corrections. In particular, we compare numerically the Dirac-Volkov DCS we have obtained

with the corresponding DCS of [1]. We end by a brief conclusion in Section 5.

2 The S-matrix element and the scattering diﬀerential

cross section

Exact solutions of relativistic wave equations [2] are very diﬃcult to obtain. However, in a

seminal paper, Volkov [3] obtained the formal solution of the Dirac equation for the relativis-
tic electron with 4-momentum pµ inside a classical monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ.
These solutions are called the relativistic Volkov states. The plane wave electromagnetic ﬁeld
Aµ of 4-momentum kµ (kµkµ = k2 = 0) depends only on the argument φ = k.x = kµxµ and
therefore Aµ is such that

Aµ = Aµ(k.x) = Aµ(φ).

The 4-vector Aµ satisﬁes the Lorentz gauge condition ∂µAµ = 0 or equivalently kµAµ = 0.
The Dirac-Volkov equation for an electron in an external ﬁeld Aµ is

average is zero Aµ = 0, then using the Gordon identity, the averaged 4-current is easily

So, the ﬁrst controversy is settled and there is indeed a term containing sin(2φ0) in the
expression of the scattering cross section. We have written a Reduce program that calculates

analytically the traces in Eq.(37). Before writing our Reduce program, we have extensively

studied the textbook by A. G. Grozin [5] which is full of worked examples in various ﬁelds of

physics particularly in QED. We give the ﬁnal result for the unpolarized DCS for the Mott

3.1 Comparison of the coeﬃcients.

The argument about the missing term proportional to sin(2φ0) having been given a convincing
explanation, we now turn to other remarks along the same lines since there are indeed other

diﬀerences between our result and the result of [1]. We discuss now the diﬀerence occurring

11

in our expression of the coeﬃcient A and the corresponding one of [1]. In their expression
c6(k.q)(k.q′) should come with a coeﬃcient 1
multiplying the product 2J 2
2.
We have written a second Reduce program that allows the comparison between the coeﬃcient

n(ξ), the single term (a2)2w2

A of [1] and the coeﬃcient A of this work. There are so many diﬀerences between our result

and the result they found for the coeﬃcient B that we refer the reader to our main Reduce

program [8]. The coeﬃcient C has already been discussed. As for the coeﬃcient D, we

have found an expression that is linear in the electromagnetic potential. In a third Reduce

program, it is shown explicitly that if we ignore the ﬁrst term in the coeﬃcient multiplying

Js(Js−1 + Js+1) given in [1], one easily gets the result we have obtained. This term does not
come from the passage from the variables (p, ˜p) to the variable (q, ˜q). The introduction of such

4-vector ˜q is not useful, makes the calculations rather lengthy and gives rise to complicated

expressions. As a supplementary consistency check of our procedure used in writing the main

Reduce program, we have reproduced the result of the DCS corresponding to the Compton

scattering in an intense electromagnetic ﬁeld given by Berestetzkii, Lifshitz and Pitaevskii [6].

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Kinematics of the collision

For the description of the scattering geometry, we work in a coordinate system in which k

This means that the direction of the laser propagation is along the Oz axis. To avoid any

||

confusion, we will compare the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) of [1] with the corresponding DCS (34)

we have obtained in the same coordinate system. The spinless DCS will also be discussed

system, the vector pi is such that pi||
ex, meaning that the undressed angular coordinate of
the incoming electron are θi = 90◦, φi = 0◦. For the scattered electron, the vector pf is such
180◦ and φf = 90◦. With this choice, we have been
pf ∈
able to reproduce qualitatively the results and all the ﬁgures of [1]. The reason underlying
this choice of the coordinates is the following. The angles (θi, φi) of pi (the same holds for
pf ) are the intrinsic angular coordinates of the incoming electron. As the vector qi is deﬁned
through pi via the relation

we cannot deﬁne intrinsic angular coordinates using qi. When the electron is subjected to the
radiation ﬁeld, it acquires new angular coordinates that can easily be determined. The key

quantity that gives an idea of the dependence of qi(and qf ) on the spatial orientation of the
electron momentum due to (k.pi)(and (k.pf )) is the cosine of the angle between qi and qf .

From these relations, one deduce that in the limit of low incoming electron energies and

third term of the RHS of Eq.(60) can be safely neglected. For high incoming electron energies

moderate ﬁeld strength, cos(

qi, qf ) and cos(

d

and intense ﬁeld strength, the diﬀerence between the two cosines increases and these terms

cannot be neglected. We shall give for the sake of illustration, tables that compare these

two cosines for the three regimes we shall investigate, namely the non relativistic-moderate

ﬁeld strength regime, the relativistic-strong ﬁeld strength regime and ﬁnally the relativistic-

intense ﬁeld strength regime. We choose the same value as [1] for the laser angular frequency

w = 0.0430 a.u for all the numerical calculations. This typical near infra-red angular frequency

is that of a neodymium laser. The other parameters are the electric ﬁeld strength ε and the
relativistic parameter γ = 1/√1
v2/c2. This parameter ﬁxes the incoming
1
q
electron total energy Ei via the relation Ei = c2γ from which one deduces the corresponding
incoming electron kinetic Ti by subtracting the rest energy (c2 in a.u) Ti = Ei −
1).
Before beginning our discussion, we would like to make general comments on the ﬁgures

c2 = c2(γ

β2 = 1/

−

−

−

obtained in [1] starting with Figure 3. This ﬁgure does not represent the envelope of the

controversial generalized equation (26) of that work. Indeed, we shall see that it represents

the envelope of the non relativistic DCS given by Eq.(34) in [1]. We give the correct envelope

for the relativistic calculations obtained by using either Eq.(34) of our work or Eq.(26) of [1].

In Figure (6) of [1], there is a diﬀerence between the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) and the spinless

particle DCS (30) though the overall behaviour is smoothly oscillatory. The results we have

13

obtained show the same oscillatory behaviour. The curves for the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) of [1]

and the Dirac-Volkov DCS (34) of our work are almost identical while the diﬀerence between

two relativistic DCSs and the spinless particle DCS given by Eq.(30) of [1] is less important

than in Figure 6 of [1]. Figure 7 of [1] is the only ﬁgure we agree with. In Figure 8 of [1], we

disagree with the behaviour of the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) of [1] particularly for small angles
around θf = 0◦. When programing Eq.(26) of [1], we obtained a value for the Dirac-Volkov
DCS at θf = 0◦ of nearly 3.2 10−14 a.u instead of the 2.2 10−14 a.u indicated in Figure 8 of [1].
Moreover, the electric ﬁeld strength ε being a key parameter (as well as the incoming electron

total energy), we have compared our Dirac-Volkov DCS and the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) of [1]

and we have come to the following important conclusions. First, for the non relativistic and low

and low-intensity ﬁeld strength regime (γ = 1.0053 a.u, ε = 0.05 a.u) and for the relativistic

regime and increasing ﬁeld strength (γ = 2.00 a.u, ε = 1.00 a.u) the diﬀerences between our

results and the results found in [1] are small but approach one percent. Second, we have a

diﬀerent picture for the relativistic-high intensity regime (γ = 2.00 a.u, ε = 5.89 a.u) where

the missing terms in [1] lead to values of the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) of [1] that over-estimate

the corresponding DCS (34)of our work. Even in the non relativistic regime (γ = 1.0053 a.u)

but for increasing ﬁeld strength, the diﬀerence between our results and the results of [1] begins

to appear clearly.

We turn now to a qualitative and quantitative discussion of the physical process. We shall

comment and analyze the results obtained in [1] in the light of those we have obtained bearing

in mind that we can hardly escape rephrasing the physical insights and explanations contained

in [1]. Our disagreement is quantitative since we have shown in the ﬁrst part of this work that

the expression (26) of [1] contains errors and a missing term proportional to sin(2φ0). So, our
primary task is to assess the importance of this errors and missing term and to what extent

they modify the quantitative and qualitative contents of [1].

4.2 The non relativistic-low electric ﬁeld strength regime

In this regime, we choose as in [1] γ = 1.0053 a.u for the relativistic parameter and ε = 0.05 a.u

for the electric ﬁeld strength. This relativistic parameter corresponds to an incoming electron

kinetic energy Ti = 100 a.u = 2.700 kev. With our choice of the angular parameters, we
compare in Table. 1 some values of cos(

pi, pf ) and cos(

qi, qf ).

Table 1:

The diﬀerence is small so in this regime and the coordinates of the undressed electron are

nearly the same as that of the dressed electron. We plot in the upper part (a) of Figure 1

the non relativistic DCS given by Eq.(34) of [1] and in the lower part (b) of the same ﬁgure,

the generalized Dirac-Volkov DCS given either by Eq.(26) of [1] or Eq.(34) of our work as

a function of the ﬁnal electron energy scaled to the photon energy. The scattering angle is

large enough so that an important number of photons can be exchanged in the course of the

collision. In this low-intensity regime, the envelope of the non relativistic DCS is qualitatively

diﬀerent from the envelope for the Dirac-Volkov and Klein-Gordon DCSs.

the argument that appears in the ordinary Bessel functions is the same for both DCSs. So

the comments made in [1] concerning the interpretation of the envelope obtained do not apply

for the Dirac-Volkov and Klein-Gordon cases. While the spectrum of Figure (1.a) of our work

(which is identical to that of Figure (1.a) of [1]) exhibits an overall asymmetric envelope with

peaks of negative energy transfer higher than peaks of positive energy transfer, this asymmetry

is less pronounced in the case of the Dirac-Volkov and spinless particle DCSs. This emphasized

asymmetry in the non relativistic case can easily be traced back by a close look at Eq.(34) of
[1]. Indeed, the non relativistic DCS depends on J 2
s (z) (z depends only weakly on s) so the
asymmetry can only come from the dependence of the modulus of the ﬁnal momentum qf on
the number of the transferred photons s according to Eq.(25) of [1]. We explicitly write this

relativistic DCS, the numerical cutoﬀ occurs (again up to machine precision) for s =

and s = 685. The visual cutoﬀ occurs for s =

500 and s = 590. The diﬀerence ∆s = 20

between our results and that of [1] is just a matter of convention. We now analyze the angular

distributions. We have summed as in [1]

100 peaks around the elastic one in order to draw

the angular dependence of the DCS. In Figure 6. of [1], the accumulated DCS is shown for

an electric ﬁeld strength ε = 0.05 a.u. The computer code we have written calculates the

Dirac-Volkov DCS (34) of our work, the Dirac-Volkov DCS (26) of [1], the spinless particle

DCS and the non relativistic DCS. At least, in the non relativistic regime, our results and

that of [1] agree very well and are both close to the results for a spinless particle. We give in

Figure 3 the angular distribution of the various DCSs.

So, this adds to the controversy. Even if we use the expression for the Dirac-Volkov DCS

given by Eq.(26) of [1], we have a diﬀerent ﬁgure for the non relativistic regime. If we now

increase the electric ﬁeld strength from ε = 0.05 a.u to ε = 1.00 a.u, the agreement remains
good between the three relativistic calculations. There is still a maximum at θf = 0◦ while the

varying from 22.5% to 30% with some peaks giving an over estimation of up to 45% for the

DCS (26) of [1] compared to the corresponding DCS (34) of this work. All these peaks are

4.3 Relativistic-strong electric ﬁeld strength regime

an incoming electron total energy Ei = 2c2 or a Ti = 0.5116 MeV . The electric ﬁeld strength

5 Conclusion

In this comment, we derived the correct expression of the ﬁrst Born diﬀerential cross section for

the scattering of the Dirac-Volkov electron by a Coulomb potential of a nucleus in the presence

of a strong laser ﬁeld. We have given the correct relativistic generalization of the Bunkin and

Fedorov treatment [7] that is valid for an arbitrary geometry. We are adamant that the core
of the whole controversy stems from the fact that in [1], the vector ηµ introduced in Eq.(43)
of our work has not been properly dealt with while it is the common method to use when

21

a trace contains a γ0 matrix. Any standard QED textbook introduces this very elementary
[1]
method. Comparison of our numerical calculations [9] with those of Szymanowski et al.

shows qualitative and quantitative diﬀerences when the incoming total electron energy and

the electric ﬁeld strength are increased particularly in the direction of the laser propagation.

The diﬀerence between our results and those of [1]can only be traced back to the mistakes

and omitted term in Eq.(26) of [1].

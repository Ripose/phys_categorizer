Abstract

Complete vacuum polarization calculations incorporating ﬁnite nuclear size are presented for

hydrogenic ions with principal quantum numbers n = 1

like ions are also treated starting with Kohn-Sham potentials, and including ﬁrst-order screening

corrections. In both cases dominant Uehling terms are calculated with high accuracy, and smaller

Wichmann-Kroll terms are obtained using numerical electron Green’s functions.

INTRODUCTION

The most important radiative correction to the spectra of highly charged ions is the Lamb

shift, which at the one-loop level consists of two contributions, the self-energy and vacuum

polarization. The eﬀect of the latter is dominated by the Uehling term [1], which was in-

troduced even before the development of the modern form of Quantum Electrodynamics

(QED). However, while relatively small, extra eﬀects known as Wichmann-Kroll terms [2]

need to be considered when theory is confronted by experimental data on highly-charged

ions of ever-increasing accuracy. An important advance in the ﬁeld was made by Gyu-

lassy [3], who pointed out that by arranging the calculation so that electron propagator

terms with positive and negative values of the angular momentum quantum number κ are

taken together, a single subtraction of the Uehling term leads to a ﬁnite expression for the

Wichmann-Kroll term free of the spurious constants that can arise when formally inﬁnite

integrals are manipulated. He presented values only for

= 1, but Soﬀ and Mohr [4] then

κ

|

treated higher κ values and showed that the partial wave series converges very rapidly.

The results of Soﬀ and Mohr covered n = 1 and n = 2 states, and included ﬁnite nuclear

size through a shell model, which allowed the use of analytic Green’s functions. However,

many-electron ions are best described with non-Coulomb potentials that incorporate electron

screening, and in this case one is forced to use numerical Green’s functions. We have used

these functions extensively in treating the self-energy [5], and one purpose of this paper is

to extend their use to the evaluation of the Wichmann-Kroll terms in a variety of atomic

systems.

Other work in the ﬁeld includes a basis set based approach by Persson et al. [6] that can

also be applied to non-Coulomb potentials. Ref. [6] in particular calculates the Wichmann-

Kroll eﬀect for lithiumlike uranium, which will also be treated here. We note the work

of Beier et al. [7] for hydrogenic ions, which is of particularly high accuracy. Finally, a

calculation of vacuum polarization eﬀects on lithiumlike ions, very similar in its treatment

of screening to what will be presented here, can be found in Ref. [8].

In the next section, we brieﬂy describe our treatment of the dominant Uehling term.

In the following section, formulas for the Wichmann-Kroll term are given, along with a

discussion of numerical issues. Screening terms are then deﬁned, and results are given in a

set of tables. A brief discussion of the accuracy of our results for lithiumlike, sodiumlike,

2

and copperlike uranium completes the paper.

modeled here with a Fermi distribution. However, when describing many-electron atoms

and ions in a QED framework, it is often convenient to incorporate some screening through

the use of non-Coulomb potentials. Here we work with three eﬀective charges, designed to

incorporate screening eﬀects in lithiumlike, sodiumlike, and copperlike ions. They represent

Kohn-Sham potentials, deﬁned through

A. Uehling Term

When the above expansion of the propagator is used in Eq. (4), the ﬁrst term on the right

hand side makes no contribution because of Furry’s theorem [10], which states that there is

an exact cancellation between loop diagrams with an odd number of external photons when

the momentum in the loop is reversed, which follows from a charge conjugation argument.

When we set up the numerical calculation of the Wichmann-Kroll terms below using a partial

wave expansion of the electron propagator, we will again discuss the vanishing of this term.

The Uehling approximation to vacuum polarization comes from replacing the last bound

propagator SF in Eq. (8) with a free propagator S0, which leads to the ultraviolet divergent

energy shift

presenting results for the contribution of the Uehling terms to vacuum polarization, we turn

to a description of the calculation of Wichmann-Kroll terms.

While this combination is ultraviolet ﬁnite by power counting, a spurious, non-gauge in-

variant ﬁnite term can show up if suﬃcient care is not taken. As was shown by Gyulassy

[3], this problem can be avoided when the propagators are represented with a partial wave

expansion by an appropriate grouping of that expansion. The calculation is carried out as
follows. We ﬁrst make a Wick rotation k0 →

Before continuing to the subtraction of the Uehling term, we discuss the subtraction of

the free propagator term, which vanishes by Furry’s theorem [10]. In terms of the partial

wave expansion of the free propagator term, which is given by the same expression as above

but with the bound radial Green’s functions g0,

∞κ

and f 0,

∞κ

replaced by the corresponding

free-electron functions, the manifestation of this cancellation is particularly simple, as each

positive value of κ gives a contribution canceled by the corresponding negative value. This

was shown analytically by Gyulassy [3], but here, since we treat both the bound and free

propagators with the same numerical methods, we use it as a check on the accuracy of our

Green’s functions. In Table I, we present partial wave results of the free-propagator term

EVP(S0) for low values of κ for the ﬁnite nuclear size 1s ground state of hydrogenlike mercury

(Z = 80). The cancellation of this term between the positive and negative κ partial waves is

obvious. Only six digits past the decimal point are shown, but the actual cancellation is even

ﬁner, which is one of the numerical tests used in this work. Also shown in the same table

are values of the bound propagator term EVP which can be seen to scale roughly with

,

κ
|

|

which is how a quadratic ultraviolet divergence is manifested in a partial wave expansion.

We next turn to the unrenormalized Uehling term, which must be evaluated with high

accuracy, as it cancels out many digits of the unrenormalized vacuum polarization. While it

7

can be formed analytically, we have found that numerical methods actually work somewhat

better, and continue to use them. A short calculation gives the Uehling term as

To carry out the evaluation of the partial wave expansion form of the Uehling term with

suﬃcient accuracy requires a great deal of care. Matters are facilitated by using an extremely

ﬁne radial grid of up to 50,000 points. This is particularly helpful in controlling the accuracy

of the ω integration where the virtual inﬁnity of the calculation can exceed 1

106 mc2 and

×

numerical instabilities at the highest ω values can lead to unphysical oscillations in the

renormalized eﬀective charge density at very small and very large radial points. These same

problems play a much smaller role in self-energy calculations, where the bound state wave

function provides suppression at these regions: here, however, the wave function does not

provide any suppression.

The second test of the numerics of our approach has to do with the integral over the

eﬀective charge density ρ(r), deﬁned through

where

(29)

Without the screening potential φ(r) from the bound electron v, the eﬀective charge density

ρ(r) should integrate to zero, as there should not be any change in the net charge. Con-

tributions to this integral from the unrenormalized vacuum polarization and Uehling terms

cancel to a level that is typically of order 10−

8 or better.

If this cancellation is not this

precise, we have found that our answers become unstable and go into disagreement with

previous calculations.

Partial wave results of the unrenormalized Uehling term for the 1s state of Hg79+ are

shown also in Table I. It can be seen that they are independent of the sign of κ and show the

same rate of increase with

as the bound propagator term EVP. The quadratic ultraviolet

κ
|

|

divergence in these term cancels, however, and their sum gives the ﬁnite Wichmann-Kroll

term which can be seen to converge very rapidly with

We now present results for the hydrogenic vacuum polarization including ﬁnite nuclear

size for states of principal quantum number n = 1

5, excluding d and higher angular

−

momentum states which have very small contributions. We model the nuclear charge distri-

bution with the Fermi distributions described in Ref. [14], with the exception of the cases

Z = 90 and Z = 92, where we use c = 7.0589 and c = 7.13753, respectively, which were

derived from Ref. [19, 20].

It is convenient to pull out the overall Z and n behavior by

working in terms of the function Fn(Zα) deﬁned through

Results for ns, np1/2 and np3/2 states are given in Tables II – IV. Where comparison is

possible, we ﬁnd our results to be in good agreement with previous calculations cited in the

introduction.

C. Screening Corrections

We now turn to the evaluation of vacuum polarization in many-electron ions with an

alkalilike electronic conﬁguration. Formulas for the Uehling and Wichmann-Kroll terms

given above are valid for any eﬀective charge Zeﬀ(r), so while it would be possible to always

start with a Coulomb potential and calculate screening eﬀects starting from that point, we

choose here to incorporate the dominant eﬀect of screening for the lithium, sodium, and

copper isoelectronic sequences by using the Kohn-Sham potentials deﬁned in Eq. (2). While

this is adequate for the Wichmann-Kroll terms, we account for screening more fully for the

Uehling terms in this section. The theory for lithiumlike ions was set out in some detail in

[13], so we simply brieﬂy generalize it here to the sodiumlike and copperlike sequences.

There are four sources of screening for the Uehling term: valence perturbed orbital terms,

core perturbed orbital terms, insertions of the Uehling term in one-photon exchange, and

derivative terms. Representative Feynman diagrams for the ﬁrst three sources are shown in

Figs. 1a – 1c, though the derivative terms do not have a standard diagrammatic represen-

tation. Beginning with the insertion of the Uehling term in one-photon exchange, we note

that the ﬁrst-order energy of an alkalilike ion is given by

We have precise agreement with the Coulomb potential results for lithiumlike uranium pre-

sented in Ref. [8], where this contribution is denoted by Eb.

In Tables V – VII, we present vacuum polarization results for the three alkalilike isoelec-

tronic sequences mentioned above. We choose to use atomic units in this case, and results

of the screening calculations just described are presented, along with those of the Uehling

and Wichmann-Kroll terms. It is interesting to note that while the higher-order screening

corrections are typically smaller in size than the lowest-order Uehling energies, such is not

the case for the np3/2 states, where the screening corrections are consistently larger than, or

at least comparable to, the corresponding Uehling energies.

III. CONCLUSIONS

The calculations presented here are intended to play a role in precision spectroscopy of

highly charged ions, so it is important to be quantitative about the accuracy. We choose to

do this in the context of ions of uranium, which are of interest because these ions have the

highest nuclear charge that has precision spectroscopy available, and relativistic and QED

eﬀects are highly enhanced at high Z. The earliest precise measurement, on lithiumlike
uranium [15], had a precision of 0.1 eV. This experiment measured the 2s1/2−
and subsequently the 2s1/2 −
Ref. [21]. More recently, the 3s

2p3/2 transition was measured with an accuracy of 0.27 eV in

3p3/2 transition in sodiumlike uranium has been measured

2p1/2 transition,

−

[16], and the experimental precision has reached 0.02 eV. Finally, the 4s

4p3/2 transition

−

in copperlike uranium has been measured to the remarkable precision of 0.0019 eV [17].

These high precision measurements pose a considerable challenge to the theory of many-

electron ions. While correlation calculations based on Dirac-Fock or model potentials con-

verge quite rapidly at this high Z and are presently suﬃciently accurate, the proper in-

corporation of negative-energy state and retardation eﬀects is best done in a ﬁeld-theoretic

context, with the relativistic many-body treatment of correlation replaced with the evalua-

tion of Feynman diagrams involving the exchange of two photons between electrons. This

procedure has been carried out for lithiumlike ions [8, 18]. After this has been done, one

needs to carry out radiative correction calculations in the many-electron environment, which

requires both precise one-loop calculations and associated screening corrections. One pur-

pose of the present paper has been to carry out the vacuum polarization part of this program

11

with accuracy at least at the level of the experimental uncertainties, and we now discuss to

what extent we have succeeded in this attempt.

We begin by discussing lithiumlike uranium, where the overall contribution of vacuum

polarization to the 2s1/2 energy is -14.742 eV. While the numerical determination of the

Uehling contribution to this of -15.831 eV is extremely accurate, care must be taken with

nuclear size dependence. Varying the c parameter used here, 7.13753 fm, by one percent

leads to changes of 0.008 eV, and because the uncertainty quoted by Zumbro et al. [20] for

the c parameter is 0.0012 fm (0.02 %), this part of the calculation needs no improvement.

If experiment continues to improve, however, a more detailed study of the eﬀect of diﬀerent

distributions of charge and higher multipoles may be necessary.

Turning to the Wichmann-Kroll calculation, which contributes 0.789 eV, the main un-

certainty here is the cutting oﬀ of the partial wave series at κ = 5. For the case of the n = 2

states of lithiumlike uranium, we extended the sum to κ = 10, and found a change of only

0.001 eV. In view of the rapid convergence of the partial wave series for this term, stopping

the calculation at κ = 5 should be quite adequate.

Finally, a more delicate issue involves screening. Here we made one approximation that

can be important, namely, treating the vacuum polarization contribution to exchange pho-

tons in Uehling approximation. Ref. [8] explicitly calculated the residual Wichmann-Kroll

term using a Coulomb potential, and found a 0.0005 eV contribution to the 2s energy, so

our approximation is valid. However, higher-order screening graphs have not been treated

here, and we therefore estimate the size of their contributions by comparing the results of

diﬀerent model potentials. We use a core-Hartree potential, deﬁned with an eﬀective charge

Zeﬀ(r) = Znuc(r)

ρc(r′),

−

r>

(38)

where ρc(r) =

a (2ja + 1)[g2

a(r) + f 2

a (r)] is the total charge density of the core electrons. In

Table VIII, we compare Kohn-Sham (KS) and core-Hartree (CH) results for all three states.

P

Considering the 2s state, we see that while a 0.096 eV change is present in the Uehling

potential, inclusion of screening reduces this to a 0.016 eV diﬀerence, far smaller than the

experimental error. The 2p states are seen to be under even better control. We consider that

our results for vacuum polarization are accurate to under 0.02 eV for lithiumlike uranium.

While the experimental accuracy of sodiumlike uranium is higher than lithiumlike ura-

nium, the higher principal quantum number reduces the size of vacuum polarization, so

12

that it need be known with less precision. Arguments similar to those given for lithiumlike

uranium can be used to show that the Uehling and Wichmann-Kroll terms are suﬃciently

well determined. A comparison of the KS and CH results is given again in Table VIII. It can

be seen that the 3s Uehling energy changes by 0.054 eV, but inclusion of screening reduces

this to 0.001 eV. We estimate the accuracy of our result here to be 0.003 eV, which is due

mainly to the potential dependence of the Wichmann-Kroll term and is again well under

the experimental error.

Finally, copperlike uranium presents the greatest challenge to theory, both because of the

complexity of the ion and the very high experimental precision that has been reached. We

again compare KS and CH results in Table VIII, and see that 4s Uehling energy changes

by 0.031 eV, an order of magnitude larger than the experimental error. Inclusion of ﬁrst-

order screening reduces this to 0.002 eV, same as the experimental error. We note that

4p1/2 transition energy is much less than the experimental error, but the shift of the

the 4p1/2 energy shifts by about the same amount, so the potential dependence of the
4s1/2 −
4p3/2 level is smaller, though it still reduces the potential dependence of the 4s1/2 −
transition energy. The shift of the Wichmann-Kroll terms is seen to be signiﬁcant on the

4p3/2

scale of the experimental error, but cancels when transitions are considered. Were we to

include screening corrections to the Wichmann-Kroll term, we expect the results of the two

potentials would give closer answers for the individual states. Thus for copperlike uranium,

the vacuum polarization results presented here should be regarded as having an accuracy

comparable to experiment for transitions, but further work is needed for ionization energies.

While the vacuum polarization calculations presented here are adequate at present, fur-

ther reduction of experimental error will require a more accurate treatment of screening. The

treatment given here is equivalent to ﬁrst-order many body perturbation theory (MBPT),

though it is done in a ﬁeld theoretic manner. Further accuracy should be obtainable by

inclusion of second-order MBPT, which is a straightforward though lengthy procedure.

The next step is to treat the self-energy diagram including screening corrections. This has

been carried out for lithiumlike ions [8, 18], and the theoretical interest for this isoelectronic

sequence has shifted to the proper inclusion of the two-loop Lamb shift, which has recently

been calculated for the ground state of hydrogenic ions [22]. While considerable work remains

to extend these calculations to the sodium and copper isoelectronic sequences, the prospect

of treating these truly many-electron systems in a purely QED manner is quite promising.

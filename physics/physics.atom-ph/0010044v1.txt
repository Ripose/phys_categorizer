Abstract

The self-energy screening correction is evaluated in a model in which the

eﬀect of the screening electron is represented as a ﬁrst-order perturbation of

the self energy by an eﬀective potential. The eﬀective potential is the Coulomb

potential of the spherically averaged charge density of the screening electron.

We evaluate the energy shift due to a 1s1/2, 2s1/2, 2p1/2, or 2p3/2 electron

screening a 1s1/2, 2s1/2, 2p1/2, or 2p3/2 electron, for nuclear charge Z in the

range 5 ≤ Z ≤ 92. A detailed comparison with other calculations is made.

I. INTRODUCTION

The self-energy correction to the electron-electron interaction is one of the many con-

tributions of order α2 to an atomic binding energy. These corrections, shown as Feynman

diagrams in Fig. 1, are often called self-energy screening corrections, and for inner shells they

are the largest of all fourth-order radiative corrections. They give rise to three terms, which

are represented in Fig. 2, when one distinguishes between the reducible and irreducible part

of the diagram in Fig. 1 (A).

A ﬁrst attempt to evaluate the contribution of such diagrams from bound state quantum

electrodynamics (BSQED) was made in 1991 [1] in an approximation in which the electrons

not associated with the self-energy loop were represented as a perturbing potential (Fig. 3).

The potential was obtained by taking a spherical average of the electron wave function,

and calculating the potential associated with the resulting charge density. More recently,

direct evaluations of the diagrams of Fig. 1 for the ground state of two-electron ions have

been made [2–7], and the method of [1] was used to provide the self-energy correction to

several interactions [8]. In this paper we report on a complete calculation of the self-energy

screening in the approximation of [1], for all combinations of pairs of the states 1s1/2, 2s1/2,

2p1/2, or 2p3/2 in the range 5 ≤ Z ≤ 92.

Terms corresponding to the diagram in Fig. 3(A) are obtained by varying the self-energy

expression with respect to the external potential of the bound-state wave function, leading

to the introduction of the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function in the potential δV .

Terms corresponding to the diagram in Fig. 3(B) are obtained by varying the expression

for the self-energy with respect to the external potential of the Green’s function and while

those in Fig. 3(A′) correspond to variation with respect to the energy of the bound state.

The expression for the self energy in a large class of potentials V(x) can be written as
the sum ESE = EL + EH of a low-energy part EL and a high-energy part EH given (in units in
which ¯h = c = me = 1) by [9]

where b = −i [(En − z)2 + iδ]1/2 , Re(b) > 0, and x21 = x2− x1. In these expressions, ϕn and
En are the eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the Dirac equation for the bound state n, and G
is the Green’s function for the Dirac equation corresponding to the operator G = (H− z)−1,
where H = α· p+V +β is the Dirac Hamiltonian. The indices l and m are summed from 1 to
3, and the index µ is summed from 0 to 3. The contour CH extends from −i∞ to 0− iǫ and
from 0 + iǫ to +i∞, with the appropriate branch of b chosen in each case. For the present
calculation, we assume that the potential V(x) is close to a pure Coulomb potential, except
for a small correction δV (x), which is not necessarily spherically symmetric. Indeed some

applications of this method have been made with non-spherically-symmetric perturbations

[8]. We obtain the screening correction to the self-energy by making the replacements

V(x) → V (x) + δV (x) ,
ϕn(x) → φn(x) + δφn(x) ,

G(x2, x1, z) → G(x2, x1, z) + δG(x2, x1, z)

En → En + δEn

(3d)

in Eqs. (1) and (2) and retaining only the ﬁrst-order correction terms. In the Eqs. (1) and

(2), and (3a) to (3d) above, we use the symbols G, En, ϕn for the exact quantities in the
potential V(x), while the symbols G, En, φn represent the corresponding exact quantities in
a pure Coulomb potential V (x). The same conventions are employed throughout the paper.

We denote the operations on the unperturbed self energy that lead to these three corrections

by δφ, δG, and δE, respectively. In particular, we employ the notation

δφ = δφn

δG = δG

in which the partial diﬀerentiation symbol denotes formal diﬀerentiation with respect to the

indicated variable, with the result evaluated with the unperturbed functions.

In Sec. II we write expressions for the ﬁrst-order perturbation corrections to the energy,

the wave function and the Green’s function. In Secs. III, IV, and V we derive the expressions

for the various contributions to the screened self-energy corresponding to the three diagrams

of Fig. 3. In a series of three earlier papers [10–12], we have derived and tested a method

of analytically isolating divergent contributions to the self-energy diagram in coordinate

space. In Secs. IV and V we derive from this earlier work the generalizations of the analytic

subtraction terms which are necessary to make all contributions to the self-energy screening

ﬁnite. The numerical results are presented in Sec. VI, and Sec. VII is the conclusion.

II. PERTURBATION EXPANSION

Replacing the potential V(x) by V (x) + δV (x), where δV (x) is spherically symmetric,
changes the wave functions, the energy, and the Green’s function, which appear in Eqs. (1)

and (2). From standard perturbation theory the ﬁrst-order energy correction is

and where χµ

κ(ˆx) is the Dirac angular momentum eigenfunction.

The ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function is given with the aid of the reduced

Green’s function GR(x2, x1, En), deﬁned by (see for example [13])

where the summation over κ runs over all nonzero integers, and where ¯ı = 3−i and ¯ = 3−j.
We are concerned with the ﬁrst-order perturbation in this expression that arises from

variation of the external potential. The self energy depends on the potential through three

quantities that appear in Eq. (17) and (18), the wave function Fn,i(x), the energy eigenvalue
En, and the Green’s function Gij
κ (x2, x1, z). The three corrections are denoted by δφ EL, δE EL,
and δG EL, respectively, with the total

δEL = δφ EL + δE EL + δG EL .

The expression (1) contains spurious parts of lower order in Zα than the complete result.

tial is of interest. A corresponding function δFL(Zα) is deﬁned by

has been taken into account.

B. Low-order matrix elements

(21)

(22)

The lower-order expectation values involving the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave func-

tion δφn can be evaluated by direct numerical integration. However, to get an independent

check of the precision of the calculation, particularly when strong cancellation occurs, we

derive a number of useful expressions in which δφn does not occur. The energy perturbation

is given by the conventional expression

δEn = hφn|δV |φni

(25)

Since we are considering here the case where the unperturbed potential is the Coulomb po-

tential with known wave functions, we can simplify the calculation of these matrix elements.

In particular, we interpret the expressions in Eqs. (24) and (25) as perturbations of the wave

function on the left-hand side to give

and

hφn|β|δφni = hδβφn|δV |φni

hφn|V |δφni = hδV φn|δV |φni ,

(26)

(27)

where δβφn and δV φn are ﬁrst-order corrections to the wave function due to perturbations β

and V , respectively. These are simply calculated as the coeﬃcients of δ in the power series

expansions in δ of the wave functions for the appropriately modiﬁed Hamiltonians

and

Hβ = α · p + (1 + δ)β + V
= α · p + (1 + δ)βm + V

HV = α · p + β + (1 + δ)V .

(28)

(29)

In (28) the second line restores the mass dependence of the Hamiltonian in order to exhibit

the dependence of the modiﬁed Coulomb wave functions on δ.

8

The wave function correction δβφn is obtained by replacing m by (1 + δ)m in φn and

calculating the coeﬃcient of the term linear in δ, which is equivalent to writing

and leads to

δβφn = m

where the derivative acts only on the wave function. A further simpliﬁcation is possible

based on the mass dependence of the wave function in (31). If x is replaced by x/m in the

second line of (28), then the mass factors out of the Hamiltonian, and the wave function is

independent of m. As a result, we have

The derivative of the potential in (32) is calculated analytically, and the derivatives in (35)

are calculated numerically by evaluating the wave function with 32 ﬁgure precision and using

a symmetric derivative formula with δ(Zα) = 10−12.

The matrix elements listed above are evaluated by Gaussian quadrature, and the code was

tested in the Coulomb case and compared to the analytic results, as described in Appendix

Our strategy for dealing with poles in the low-energy part is to calculate the line integral

over z of the diﬀerence between the complete integrand and the pole terms, and add the pole

terms integrated analytically. In the unperturbed self-energy calculation, the singularities

along the real axis in the interval (0, 1) are poles, and the appropriate prescription for

integration over z yields the principal value integral in Eq. (17). In the present context,

there are double poles as well, so it is necessary to reexamine the original derivation to

obtain the correct prescription. It follows from the discussion in Ref. [9] that the integration

over z can be written as

ReZC+

dz U(z),

(57)

where C+ is a contour that extends from z = 0 to z = En above the real axis in the complex z

plane. Here we use a method based on an analytic evaluation of the pole terms, as described

in Ref. [14]. With the notation Up for the pole terms of U, we have

dz [U(z) − Up(z) + Up(z)] ,
dz"U(z) − Up(z) +

(58)

The pole at z = En, the endpoint of the integral over z, does not cause any problem, as

follows from the discussion in Sec. III C [see Eqs. (37) to (40)]. The relevant integrals for

the analytic evaluation of the pole terms are

E. Numerical evaluation of the ﬁrst-order correction to the Green’s function for the

low-energy part

Numerical evaluation of the Coulomb Green’s functions in this paper is based on the

explicit formulas given, for example, in Eqs. (A.16) and (A.17) of Ref. [9], together with

the numerical algorithms described in Ref. [15]. The ﬁrst-order correction to the Green’s

function in Eq. (16), for the range of arguments relevant to the low-energy part, is evaluated

by numerical integration over x3, where the interval of integration is divided into four subin-

tervals: (0, y1), (y1, y2), (y2, y3), and (y3,∞). Deﬁning p = 2√1 − z2, y0 = 3, and assuming
x2 ≤ x1, we choose y1 = min(y0, px2), y2 = min(max(y0, px2), px1), and y3 = max(y0, px1).
In the ﬁrst interval we make the substitution x3 = ξ3, and integrate over ξ by Gauss-Legendre

quadrature with 12 to 26 integration points. In the second and third interval we also do

Gauss-Legendre integration, with 17 to 33 and 11 to 21 points, respectively. We use 6 to

18 point Gauss-Laguerre integration for the remaining interval. The integrations over the

15

second and fourth intervals are the least accurate. For a 2s electron at Z = 20 the integral

over (y1, y2) has an error of a few parts in 106 in the worst case.

F. Reduced Green’s Function

In the preliminary version of this calculation [10], a purely numerical method of evalu-

ating the reduced Green’s function was employed. However, while that method is adequate

at high Z, it gives unsatisfactory results for the 2s state when Z ≤ 20, so a new method
was developed that yields better precision. As a check of the coding of the later method,

the results of the two methods were compared and are in agreement within a relative diﬀer-

ence of 10−6 over a wide range of the variables. Both methods are brieﬂy described in the

following subsections.

1. Evaluation of the Reduced Green’s Function by numerical pole removal

Eq. (48) can be written as

Gij
κ (x2, x1, En + ǫ) = −

fn,i(x2)fn,j(x1)

ǫ

+GR,ij

κ

(x2, x1, En) + O(ǫ) .

As an immediate consequence of this relation, we have

1
2

[Gij

κ (x2, x1, En + ǫ) + Gij

κ (x2, x1, En − ǫ)]
(x2, x1, En) + O(ǫ2) ,

= GR,ij

κ

(65)

(66)

so the reduced Green’s function can be easily obtained from the full Green’s function by

symmetric interpolation of the energy variable. We form a linear combination of two such

interpolations in order to obtain a result with an error of order ǫ4 rather than ǫ2.

In

particular, we have

q

κ (x2, x1, En + ǫ) + Gij

κ (x2, x1, En − ǫ)]

+C4hq ǫ4 + (1 − q) ǫ′4i + O(ǫ6) + O(ǫ′6) ,

where the choice

provides

ǫ′ =   q

q − 1!

1
2

ǫ;

q > 1

q ǫ2 + (1 − q) ǫ′2 = 0

(67)

(68)

(69)

with the parameter q free to vary in the range (1,∞). The choice q = 4
3 gives the Lagrange
interpolation formula with equally spaced evaluation points: ǫ′ = 2ǫ. With the choice in

Eq. (68), the fourth-order term is proportional to

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
q ǫ4 + (1 − q) ǫ′4(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

=

q
q − 1

ǫ4 .

(70)

The coeﬃcient of ǫ4 is 4 for equally spaced points and approaches 1 as q → ∞. As a
compromise between a large coeﬃcient for q near 1 and the minimum coeﬃcient as q → ∞,
with a correspondingly larger roundoﬀ error, we employ the value q = 10. The interpolation

interval is taken to be ǫ = 0.02 (En+1 − En) where En and En+1 are the Dirac eigenvalues
for principal quantum number n and n + 1 for the same κ. This interval avoids overlap with

the nearest pole of the Green’s function.

2. Direct evaluation of the Reduced Green’s Function

The method developed for the present work is similar to that of Hylton [13,16], but

diﬀers in the details of its implementation. From Eq. (65), it is evident that we obtain the

reduced Green’s function by expanding the various components in the explicit expression for

the radial Green’s function in powers of ǫ = z − En and keeping only the ﬁnal combinations
of terms that are of order 1. To implement this, at each step in the numerical evaluation

17

of the reduced Green’s function we calculate only the coeﬃcients of the leading two terms

in the power series in ǫ and discard the higher-order terms. In certain cases, it is necessary

to begin with three terms in the expansions, because the leading term either vanishes or

cancels an equal leading term in forming a diﬀerence. As suggested by the form of the

following equations, many of the coeﬃcients follow from combinations of coeﬃcients that

appear earlier in the calculation.

The code for the numerical calculation was written by modifying the existing code for the

radial Green’s function described in Refs. [15] and [17], so only a few details that illustrate

the approach are given here. We deﬁne the radial quantum number nr = n−|κ|. Expansions
are needed for z:

z = z0 + z1ǫ + z2ǫ2 + · · ·

z0 = En; z1 = 1; z2 = 0 ,

for c = √1 − z2:

nr + λ

c0 =

c = c0 + c1ǫ + c2ǫ2 + · · ·

where γ = Zα and λ = √κ2 − γ2, for w = γ/c:
w = w0 + w1ǫ + w2ǫ2 + · · ·

w0 =

(73)

and for ν = γz/c:

ν = ν0 + ν1ǫ + ν2ǫ2 + · · ·

ν0 = z0w0; ν1 = z0w1 + z1w0;

ν2 = z0w2 + z1w1 .

(74)

Expressions that appear in the deﬁnitions of the radial Green’s functions include λ − ν:

18

λ − ν = −nr − ν1ǫ − ν2ǫ2 + · · ·

where γE = 0.577 . . . is Euler’s constant. The recursion relations used to calculate the power

series for the Whittaker functions are treated in a similar manner. For example, for the

power series evaluation of Mν+(1/2),λ(2cx) by means of the recursion relations in Eq. (D.2)

of [15], we write

T (m) = T0(m) + T1(m)ǫ + · · ·
T0(0) = 1; T1(0) = 0

T0(m + 1) =

(m − nr)2c0x

(m + 2λ + 1)(m + 1)

T0(m)

T1(m + 1) =

(m − nr)2c0x

(m + 2λ + 1)(m + 1)
[(m − nr)c1 − ν1c0]2x
(m + 2λ + 1)(m + 1)

+

T0(m)

(77)

The termination of the power series for the leading term in Eq. (77) at m = nr corresponds

to fact that the leading term in Eq. (65) is proportional to the bound-state wave function.

The calculation of the reduced Green’s function in this work is based on the application

of two-term expansions in ǫ, as described above, to the numerical evaluation of the complete

Green’s function (see Appendix D of Ref. [15]). The numerical value of the reduced Green’s

function is just the collection of terms with combined order 1 in ǫ.

19

G. Numerical evaluation of the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function

The ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function, given by Eq. (12), is evaluated with the

aid of the reduced Green’s function as described in Sec. III F. The numerical integration in

Eq. (12) is divided into 3 segments:

δfn,i(x) =

(78)

where pn = 2q1 − E2

n is the coeﬃcient of the argument in the exponent that governs the

behavior of the integrand for large values of the argument, x1 = min (xp, 3), and x2 =

max (xp, 3). The ﬁrst and second integrals are evaluated by means of 30 point Gauss-

Legendre quadrature and the third is evaluated with 15 point Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.

The accuracy of the perturbed wave function calculated according to Eq. (78) has been tested

in the Coulomb case by comparison to the result obtained by numerical diﬀerentiation of

the Coulomb wave function.

For values of the argument of the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function near the

origin, we found that greater numerical accuracy and speed could be obtained with a nu-

merical evaluation based on the expansion in powers of x. This expansion is described in

Appendix B.

IV. HIGH ENERGY PART

The high-energy part, given by the integral in Eq. (2), must be regularized, since it is

formally inﬁnite. We employ the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme, following the method of

Refs. [10,12] to isolate and remove the divergent contributions. In Ref. [12] we demonstrated

that suitable numerical convergence can be achieved through the use of a term-by-term

20

subtraction method. This particular method has the advantage that it does not require a

mix of coordinate-space and momentum-space calculations as do earlier methods, but works

entirely within coordinate space. In this method, the high-energy part EH, given by Eq. (2),
is separated into two parts: EHA and EHB. The divergences are all contained in EHA and can
be calculated completely analytically, while EHB is ﬁnite and is treated numerically. In this
section we describe the method used to evaluate δEHB, while the method to compute δEHA

is discussed in Sec. V; the total is

δEH = δEHA + δEHB .

(79)

.

The high-energy remainder with term-by-term subtraction, from Eq. (32) in [12], is

Refs. [9,12,14,18], Fn,i(x) are radial components of the bound-state wave function as before,
and κn is the spin-angular momentum quantum number of the bound state n. The ex-

pressions for the free Green’s function radial components F ij

κ (x2, x1, z) and their derivatives

can be found in [12] and those of the Coulomb Green’s function can be found in [9]. The

methods we used for summation over angular momentum κ and for numerical integrations

are identical to those described in [12] and will not be repeated here. We also found that

the convergence of the numerical integration was much better than in the case of the un-

perturbed self-energy. We thus did not use the extra subtraction term K (0,2)

D (x2, x1, z) that

was necessary in [12] to obtain good convergence at low Z. The high-energy remainder

for the self-energy screening is obtained from Eq. (80) as described in Sec. II as the sum

δφEHB + δGEHB + δEEHB. In the three following subsections we derive the expressions that
are used to obtain δφEHB, δGEHB, and δEEHB from Eqs. (80) to (84).

A. Wave function correction

To obtain the expression for the high-energy remainder for the wave function correction,

we need the functional derivatives of Eqs. (81) to (84) with respect to the radial wave

functions Fn,i(x). For the full expression (81) we have

Kφ,κ(x2, x1, z) =

In order to evaluate the expression in (87), we need the derivative of the bound-state

Dirac wave function and the derivative of its ﬁrst-order correction in the potential δV . The

We do the corresponding calculation for the high-energy term to account for variation of

the Coulomb Green’s function under a change of the potential. Since the Coulomb Green’s

function has no poles on the high energy integration contour (which lies on the imaginary

axis), we may directly apply Eq. (16) to obtain

C. Numerical evaluation of the ﬁrst-order correction to the Green’s function for the

high-energy part

The evaluation of the the Green’s function correction to the high-energy part is the

most diﬃcult and time consuming part of the present calculation because of the additional

non-trivial integration over x3 and the necessity of evaluating integrals over a product of

two Coulomb Green’s functions in Eq. (92). The calculation is facilitated somewhat by

subtracting and adding an additional term that closely approximates the term in Eq. (92).

D. Energy correction

We evaluate δEEHB, given by

δEEHB = δEn

∂

∂EnEHB ,

(100)

by numerical diﬀerentiation of EHB. We employ an eﬀective inﬁnitesimal displacement of
the energy variable obtained by making the replacement of En(Zα) by En[(Z ± ǫ)α], with
ǫ = 0.002. The symmetric derivative formula with this displacement has an uncertainty of

a few parts in 106. One expects that numerical integration errors, as discussed in [12], are

slowly varying functions of Z and largely cancel in forming the derivative, leading to an

accurate result for the derivative. Evidently, however, the error in terminating the sum over

κ does not cancel as strongly, which may lead to signiﬁcant uncertainties for some Z and nℓ.

We have thus found it preferable to diﬀerentiate directly the running term in the sum over

angular momenta in Eq. (80). To study this eﬀect, we compare numerically ∂

26

cutoﬀ value. Although the two methods of calculation converge to the same value for a very

small cutoﬀ (10−10), the results with a larger cutoﬀ can disagree by a few parts in 10−4.

Since very small cutoﬀ values would lead to other problems when r is close to 1, we evaluate

the energy derivative by the term-by-term method. Other illustrations of this problem are

discussed in Sec. VI A.

V. ANALYTIC TERMS

In this section we evaluate analytically the terms that are subtracted in the numerical

calculation described in Sec. IV for each of the three contributions to the screened self-energy.

In Refs. [10,12], with this application in mind, we were careful not to obscure the origins

of V and En through the use of the Dirac equation. The individual terms corresponding to

the three diagrams of Fig. 3 are thus obtained by direct diﬀerentiation.

A. Wave-function correction

The analytic portion of the wave-function correction follows from Refs. [10,12]. In each

of the terms E(i,j)

H , we calculate the variation with respect to a change in the wave function

based on the explicit dependence on the wave function, and obtain

correction is separately ﬁnite.

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Coulomb tests

(114)

(115)

(116)

In order to check the accuracy of the numerical calculation, the equations derived in

the previous sections, and the parallelized code, we compare the calculations obtained by

numerical diﬀerentiation of the one-electron self-energy function F (Zα) to the results of

29

the method presented in this paper using δV (r) = −ǫ α/r as a perturbing potential. This
method, proposed in Ref. [1], is very eﬃcient, as each individual contribution to the screened

self-energy can be checked independently. The overall agreement between the results of these

two methods of calculation is good, although diﬀerences between some contributions can be

several times the combined uncertainties based only on the apparent convergence of the

numerical integration. These additional errors come from the numerical problems described

in Sec. IV D. An illustrative example is the wave function correction. One can compare the

term-by term derivative with respect to Z in the wave function to the derivative obtained

from two converged sums, as is done in Eqs. (101) and (102). There is also an independent

calculation based on the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function from Eq.

(9). The

evolution of this sum for smaller and smaller values of the cutoﬀ error are displayed in

Fig. 4. One can see that although the two calculations converge to the same limit when the

cutoﬀ is as small as 10−15, the results follow very diﬀerent paths. Only the term-by-term

diﬀerentiation method follows the result obtained from evaluation of the ﬁrst-order correction

to the wave function independently of the cutoﬀ. This constitutes a very demanding test of

our numerical evaluation of the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function. The diﬀerence
between the two calculations is never smaller than 8× 108, which is the error from numerical
uncertainties of the full Green’s function and the error in the numerical derivative.

To improve the numerical precision, we have employed a subdivision of the integration

over r into regions with 0 < r < 0.4 and with 0.4 < r < 1, as described in Ref. [12]. This

division provides an accurate evaluation that does not require functional evaluations with

values of r too close to 1. In this way we where able to obtain an accurate comparison of

all contributions in the high-energy part.

A few such problems remain in the test calculations in the low-energy part at low Z. We

did not attempt to improve the accuracy, because we have enough accurate cases to check

the code and numerical procedures. From the tests we have performed, it is clear that the

calculation based on numerical diﬀerentiation is the less accurate. However since numerical

diﬀerentiation is used in the ﬁnal result to obtain the reducible correction we have increased

30

the total uncertainty of both the pure Coulomb test and spherically-averaged potential of

the next section accordingly.

B. Results with spherically-averaged one-electron potential

The calculations of interest for physical applications are based on realistic potentials

obtained from the spherically-averaged potential of Eq. (C2) of Appendix C. All results

presented here are given in terms of the scaled function deﬁned by

Enℓj,n′ℓ′j ′ =

α2(Zα)3

πn3 Fnℓj,n′ℓ′j ′(Zα) mc2

(117)

All 16 possible total scaled functions F (Zα) for the self-energy screening of nℓ electron
by a n′ℓ′ electron, 1 ≤ n, n′ ≤ 2, 0 ≤ ℓ, ℓ′ ≤ 1 are given in Table II and in Figs. 5 to 8. It can
be seen that the uncertainty at low Z can be as high as 30% for the screening of 2p electrons

at Z = 10, or as low as 10−6. These functions can be used to evaluate the self-energy

screening correction to any atom with two to ten electrons, in a shell n ≤ 2. As an example
we treat the case of lithiumlike uranium. With the results presented here we can compute

the self-energy screening correction for all three states 1s22s, 1s22p1/2 and 1s22p3/2. A ﬁrst

approximation is obtained for transition energies by neglecting the core relaxation. The

self-energy screening correction to 2pj → 2s transition energy is evaluated using Eq. (117)
as ∆Ej = 2E2pj,1s − 2E2s,1s, where the factor of two accounts for the fact that there are two
1s electrons screening n = 2 electron. A better approximation, which takes into account the

relaxation of the core electrons, and provides a value for the total binding energy is given

by E1s22s = 2(E2s,1s + E1s,2s + E1s,1s) and E1s22pj = 2(E2pj,1s + E1s,2pj + E1s,1s). The results of
these calculations are presented in Table IV together with all other calculations known to

date.

It should be noted that the present method is equivalent to the Coulomb approximation

in certain cases. If one considers only the Coulomb contribution in the interaction between

the two electrons in Fig. 2, the present method provides the equivalent contribution to the

31

ground state of two-electron ions. This follows from the fact that between s states, only the

monopole part of the 1/r12 operator contributes. This radial contribution of the monopole

part is exactly given by the potential in Eq. (B10). Moreover the retarded part of the

Coulomb interaction vanishes in this case. Finally, the exchange correction only involves the

spin of the two electrons and corresponds to a multiplication of the function F1s,1s(Zα) by

two.

The above arguments can be extended for all cases where an electron of arbitrary quan-

tum number interacts with a s electron. The s electron couples only to the monopole term

in the angular expansion of the Coulomb interaction.

If, however, the electrons are not

identical, then there is an exchange term with additional multipole terms.

In this case,

the retardation contribution to the Coulomb interaction is also non-zero. Obviously in the

relativistic case the magnetic part of the electron-electron interaction should be considered.

Because of these considerations we can compare our results to the Coulomb part of

the calculation done by the G¨oteborg Group. In Fig. 5 we plot also the function F (Zα)

from Refs. [3,19]. The diﬀerence between the two calculations is displayed on Fig. 9. The

agreement is very good for medium-Z, while the diﬀerence between the two calculations

increases with increasing Z, which is due to the inclusion of ﬁnite nuclear size in Refs. [3,19],

while the present results are for a point nucleus. This comparison thus provides the ﬁnite

nuclear size eﬀect on the two-electron self-energy. The diﬀerence at low Z (5 and 10) are

due to numerical inaccuracies. Since no uncertainties are given in Ref. [19], which contains

more accurate values than Ref. [3], we assume an uncertainty of 1 in the last digit (note

that F (Zα) in Ref. [19] is two times ours.)

The low-Z behavior of the self-energy correction for to the Coulomb interaction to

F1s,1s(Zα) is known from the work of Araki [22] and Sucher [23], and 1/Z expansions from

Drake [25] to be

(118)

while the magnetic part is

1s,1s(Zα) =

8

(119)

We cannot directly compare our value for F1s,1s(Zα) with those of Yerokhin et al. [2,4],

because their results also include the magnetic and retardation contribution to the self

energy and our model does not. This correction contributes even at very low Z since it

contains the free-electron anomalous magnetic moment from the vertex correction. The

diﬀerence between the total contribution (for point nucleus) from Ref. [4] and the present

work is plotted on Fig. 10 for 20 ≥ Z. Evidently, the magnetic interaction contribution to
the two-electron self-energy is much larger than the contribution of the ﬁnite nuclear size. A

simple ﬁt of the diﬀerence between the present result and the one in Ref. [4] with a second-

order polynomial yields 0.124 for the contribution of the anomalous magnetic moment, in

good agreement with the value in Eq. (119). From the ﬁgure, it is evident that for Z as

low as 5 the higher-order terms still make a signiﬁcant contribution. On the same ﬁgure

we also plot the Breit contribution from Ref. [19], which is in agreement with the diﬀerence

between Yerokhin et al. and the present work for Z ≥ 20, and matches reasonably well the
extrapolated values even down to Z = 1.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we describe a method of approximately evaluating two-electron radiative

corrections that can easily be generalized to the direct evaluation of the correction repre-

sented by the diagrams in Fig. 2. Accuracy and correctness of the method and programs

is assessed by extensive comparisons with numerical derivatives of well-known one-electron

self-energy results for a Coulomb perturbation. It is demonstrated that the method can work

down to Z = 5 in some cases with reasonable accuracy. With the use of a more accurate

Green’s function evaluation and convergence acceleration techniques, following Refs. [20,21],

it is likely that calculation can be performed for He. The results presented in the present

33

paper also provides approximate self-energy screening corrections in any ion with less than

10 electrons, thus providing a valuable, QED-based replacement for methods based on the

Welton approximation [26,27] or other, less eﬃcient, screening schemes as used in atomic

structure codes. It is also equivalent to the direct Coulomb contribution for some states of

helium-like ions.

This method could also be used with numerical Dirac-Fock potentials and wave functions

from one of the codes in Refs. [28,29]. Preliminary tests show that good numerical accu-

racy can be achieved. Such an approach would provide more accurate self-energy screening

corrections for the outer shells of very heavy transuranic elements or for inner hole binding

energies [30].

The numerical calculations presented here have been made possible by a generous com-

puter time allocation on the IBM SP2 at the Centre National Universitaire Sud de Calcul

(Montpellier, France). Some of the calculations and computer program development were

done on the NIST SP2.

APPENDIX A: NUMERICAL TEST

As a consistency check on the computer code, we carry out a test calculation in which

the correction terms are generated by numerical diﬀerentiation of the unperturbed Coulomb

self energy with respect to the nuclear charge Z. This should give the same result as the

screening calculation where both the unperturbed potential and the perturbing potential

are the Coulomb potential, with an appropriate normalization factor.

In other words, we consider the potential

V (x) = −

(Z + ∆Z)α

x

(A1)

and let

34

where

V (x) = V0(x) + δV (x)

V0(x) = −
δV (x) = −

Zα

(A2)

(A3)

If the level shift E(Z) is known as a function of Z for the Coulomb potential, then the exact

correction due to δV (x) is E(Z + ∆Z) − E(Z) and the ﬁrst-order correction in ∆Z is

δE(Z) = ∆Z lim
δZ→0
∂
∂Z

= ∆Z

E(Z + δZ) − E(Z)

δZ

E(Z) ≡ ∆ZE′(Z)

(A4)

Thus the ﬁrst-order perturbation due to the potential δV (x), with unit charge shift ∆Z = 1

should be exactly equal to the derivative with respect to Z of the Coulomb level shift E′(Z).

APPENDIX B: ORIGIN EXPANSION OF THE FIRST-ORDER CORRECTION

TO THE WAVE FUNCTION

This origin expansion is made with the use of the diﬀerential equation for the ﬁrst-order

correction to the wave function in Eq. (91). However this expansion has a diﬀerent form

depending on whether one uses a Coulomb perturbing potential or a potential created by

an other electron.

1. Coulomb perturbation potential

In the case of a Coulomb perturbing potential, the correction to the wave function must

have a logarithmic contribution, so as to cancel the α/x term in the lowest order of the

development. We write

which behaves as ω near the origin. We then extract coeﬃcients of xj log(x) and of xj and

solve for the ζ (j)

and λ(j)

coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcient of the log(x)/x term for an unperturbed

All ζ coeﬃcients can thus be expressed as a function of ζ (2)

0 . These coeﬃcients must be

determined from the normalization condition of the perturbed wave function. This obliges

to explicitly write ζ (i)

n , n > 0, as a function of ζ (2)

0

rather than keeping them as function of

ζ (i)
n−1. The latter expressions are simpler, but the former are very large. We use Mathematica

to build the equations obeyed by the ζ (i)

n an λ(i)
n , extracting the part which depends on ζ (i)

of ζ (i)

n coeﬃcients, evaluate the explicit expressions

0 and the one which doesn’t, and generating

FORTRAN code. The code can have hundreds of lines for each piece of ζ (i)

expression of df can ﬁnally be recast as

A comparison for a small value of x of the expansion and of the value obtained by the use of




the reduced Green’s function as described in Sec. III G yield two values of ζ (2)

0 , one for each

component of the wave function. A comparison of the two values provide a good check of the

algebra. We compute ζ (j)

i

and λ(j)

i

coeﬃcients up to j = 3. The value of ζ (2)
0

obtained from

each component of the wave function at x = 0.0005 agree with an accuracy of 13 signiﬁcant

ﬁgures, for n = 1 and n = 2, κn = −1, 1, −2.

2. Electron screening potential

The screening potential described in Eq. (C2) leads to an origin expansion rather diﬀerent

than the one described in the preceding section. In order to evaluate the origin expansion of

37

the ﬁrst-order wave function correction we ﬁrst evaluate the screening potential expansion.

Using the origin expansion of the wave function and Eq. (C2), one can easily show that

δV (j)(x) = δV (j)(0) + x2λ(j)   ∞

where λ(j) = qκ2

δV (j)(0) = αZ ∞

The asymptotic expansion is obtained by substituting Eq. (B10) in the Poisson equation

obeyed by the potential

d

dx2 (xδV (j)(x)) + αxhf 2

1 (x) + f 2

2 (x)i = 0

(B12)

and expanding the two radial component of the wave function in powers of x.

With such an expansion the shape of the origin expansion of the ﬁrst order correction to

the wave function is

APPENDIX C: MODEL POTENTIALS

One of the models considered here for a screening potential is the spherically averaged

potential that arises from the charge distribution of another electron in state j in the atom:

aid of the identity

x(cid:29) = −

∂En
∂Z

(C4)

where En is the energy eigenvalue of the screening wave function.

The crossover point is taken to be x0 = 2/q1 − E2

n. The integral in (C2) is evaluated by

20 point Gauss Legendre quadrature with a new integration variable t over the range (0, 1)

deﬁned by x1 = x2t4, and the integral in (C3) is evaluated by 25 Gauss Laguerre quadrature

with a new integration variable s over the range (0,∞) where x1 = x2 + s/(2q1 − E2
n). This
prescription gives a precision of better than one part in 1012 for the range 1 ≤ Z ≤ 100, as
determined by comparing results of the two methods of integration in (C2) and (C3) .

FIG. 10. Comparison between calculation for point nucleus (including Coulomb and magnetic

part of the electron-electron interaction) from Ref. [4] and the Coulomb value from this work. The

solid line represents a second-order polynomial ﬁt to the diﬀerence and extrapolates to −0.124 for
Z = 0, as expected from Eq. (119). Also plotted are the Breit values from Ref. [19], which are in

reasonable agreement with the extrapolation.

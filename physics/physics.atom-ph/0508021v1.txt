Multi-eletron giant dipole resonanes of atoms in rossed eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds are investi-

gated. Stationary on(cid:28)gurations orresponding to a highly symmetri arrangement of the eletrons

on a deentered irle are derived, and a normal-mode and stability analysis are performed. A

lassi(cid:28)ation of the various modes, whih are dominated by the magneti (cid:28)eld or the Coulomb in-

terations, is provided. Based on the mtdh approah, we arry out a six-dimensional wave-paket

dynamial study for the two-eletron resonanes, yielding in partiular lifetimes of more than 0.1µs

for strong eletri (cid:28)elds.

INTRODUCTION

Interations of atoms with strong eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds, in partiular rossed (cid:28)elds,

have long been the foal point of various researh e(cid:27)orts [? ? ? ? ? ? ? ℄. The

on(cid:29)iting symmetries inherent in the eletroni motion in atomi and external (cid:28)elds make

for a rih variety of phenomena. In this light they are not only interesting from a theoretial

standpoint, suh as the hydrogen atom, whih onstitutes a paradigm for a haoti system

[? ? ? ? ? ℄: Their study also had a ma jor impat on a number of other (cid:28)elds, ranging

from semiondutor physis to astrophysis.

However, for a long time theoretial investigations did not go beyond the stage of treating

the nuleus as `frozen', the so-alled in(cid:28)nite-mass approximation. The model underlying this

piture is the onept that the atomi motion ould be separated into that of the enter of

mass and the one relative to it. While this is perfetly justi(cid:28)ed for translationally invariant

systems(cid:22)going along with the onservation of the total momentum(cid:22)it eases to be true

in the presene of magneti (cid:28)elds. Nonetheless, a weaker version of this proedure an be

established in the ase of (neutral) atoms in homogeneous (cid:28)elds [? ? ? ? ℄. In this pseudo-

separation, a onserved quantity termed pseudo-momentum(cid:22)the total momentum plus a

(cid:28)eld-dependent ompensation(cid:22)allows to obtain a Hamiltonian that depends on the relative

oordinates only. However, that relative motion strongly depends on the enter of mass via

the pseudo-momentum. This oupling gives rise to some new and interesting e(cid:27)ets, suh

as haoti di(cid:27)usion of the enter of mass [? ? ℄, or dynamial self-ionization [? ? ℄ for the

ase of ions.

Yet one of the most prominent among these (cid:28)nite-mass e(cid:27)ets is the existene of giant

dipole states, where the eletrons an be deentered from the nuleus by many 10, 000 atomi

units [? ? ℄. The systemati base for this was the gauge-independent generalized potential

(cid:28)rst derived for hydrogen by Dippel et al.

[? ℄ and extended to arbitrary atoms by

Shmelher [? ℄. It has been applied extensively to study giant dipole states in the two-

body ase; e.g., hydrogen [? ℄ and positronium [? ? ℄, where the large inter-partile

distane prevents annihilation for up to several years. By ontrast, the extension to the

multi-eletron ase has attrated only limited attention. There have been indiations for

two-eletron quasistable giant-dipole states based on a loal semilassial analysis [? ℄.

The aim of this paper is to both provide a loal analysis of general N -eletron system and

2

investigate the stability of the ful l quantum-mehanial system. In order to (cid:28)rst analyze

the N -eletrons ase analytially, we look for stationary points of the so-alled generalized

potential of the e(cid:27)etive relative motion (the `giant-dipole on(cid:28)guration') so as to arry

out a normal-mode analysis about these points. Equipped with this insight into the loal

behavior, we study the exat system N = 2 numerially using wave-paket propagation.

Here we resort to the mtdh method (Multi-Con(cid:28)guration Time-Dependent Hartree) [? ?

? ℄.

This artile is organized as follows. In Se. II, the theoretial framework of the pseudo-

separation is reviewed and applied to derive the generalized potential of the relative motion.

Se. III then deals with the stationary points of the generalized potential as a base for the

analysis of giant dipole resonanes.

In the subsequent setion, the normal-mode analysis

for N eletrons is arried out. To this end, the loal equations of motion are derived

(IV A), whose eigenmodes and -vetors are omputed numerially (IV B) as the solutions of

a quadrati eigenvalue problem. Se. V ontains a wave-paket dynamial study of the two-

eletron system based on the mtdh method. Results on the stability, spetral properties

and lower bounds for the lifetimes of the resonanes are presented.

II. THE N -ELECTRON ATOM IN CROSSED ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC

FIELDS

The Hamiltonian of an atom, onsisting of N eletrons (of mass m) and a nuleus (mass

M0 ) interating via the Coulomb potential V , reads in the laboratory frame:

H =

Here an eletron (index i

N ) has the eletri harge e =

the vetor potential A(r), whose gauge is not (cid:28)xed here.

In the (cid:28)eld-free ase, the translation invariane of the system(cid:22)going along with the

onservation of the total momentum(cid:22)guarantees a omplete separation of the enter-of-

mass and the relative motion. The vetor potential now breaks that symmetry. For the

speial ase of homogeneous (cid:28)elds, though, it was shown that a so-alled pseudo-separation

3

of the enter-of-mass motion is possible . The key is that even though the total momentum

is not onserved, the total pseudo-momentum K :=

motion. This is ruial in performing a gauge-independent pseudo-separation of the CM

motion [? ? ℄, whih onsists of the following steps:

1. Transformation to CM and oordinates relative to the nuleus, {

RCM , ri}, yielding

HCM and KCM .

2. Choose the total wave funtion to be a simultaneous eigenstate of the pseudomomen-

tum with eigenvalue K: (KCM −

K)ΨK = 0. The result is of the form

ΨK(RCM ,

It has to be emphasized that gauge independene is an essential quality of the pseudo-

separation sheme outlined here. A ma jor drawbak inherent in any (cid:28)xed-gauge approah is

T represents the (gauge-dependent) kineti energy of the relative motion; it depends
on the gauge via f . As opposed to that, the generalized potential V is manifestly gauge-

independent and is therefore identi(cid:28)ed as an e(cid:27)etive potential for the eletroni motion at

a given value of the total pseudo-momentum. Beyond the usual Coulomb potential and the

Stark terms due to the external eletri (cid:28)eld, we have an expression orresponding to the

CM-kineti energy,

The (cid:28)rst term, the analogue of the (cid:28)eld-free CM energy, is merely a onstant. The seond

For rossed (cid:28)elds, it is therefore inviting to ombine the Stark terms arising from both

the external and the motional eletri (cid:28)eld and aount for them by de(cid:28)ning the e(cid:27)etive

We have thus redued our problem of rossed (cid:28)elds to a purely magneti one.

In what

follows, we will always deal with H

(K′, 0) for simpliity.

The generalized potential derived above gives rise to many e(cid:27)ets, among the most promi-

nent ones being the existene of giant dipole states (GDS). The onern of the following two

setions is to derive stationary points of that potential whih aomodate these states, and

to lassify their normal modes.

III. STATIONARY CONFIGURATIONS OF THE GENERALIZED POTENTIAL

With the gauge-independent generalized potential at hand, we an now start our searh

for deentered stationary points, whih we will identify as andidates for giant dipole reso-

nanes. To failitate the searh for stationarities, we will (cid:28)rst hoose onvenient oordinates

(Subsetion III A) whih present a suitable extension of the ase N = 2 [? ℄. We will then

derive and solve the stationarity onditions by an eduated guess in III B.

A. The eletroni enter of mass frame

As we know from the studies on the one-eletron ase [? ? ? ℄, it is the CM-kineti energy

(5) that is responsible for the deentered states. It was pointed out in Eq. (4) already that

this term depends on the ombination R = 1
N

N
j=1 rj, whih we refer to as the eletroni

enter of mass (ECM ). It is thus natural to introdue the ECM as a new oordinate. In

addition, we will hoose N

1 vetors relative to the ECM, i.e. to deompose ri = R + si ,

−

where the {

si} only aount for all but one (say, the N th) eletron's relative position:

B. Existene of stationary points

Given the advantageous form of the Hamiltonian (6-7), we are now ready to look for

stationary points of the potential. If we de(cid:28)ne Q = (R, s1, . . . , sN

By (1.), if there is a solution, then the eletroni enter of mass will be aligned along the

ξ axis, that is the deentering takes plae anti-parallel to the eletri (cid:28)eld. Based on this,

Figure 1: The extremal omponent X1/2 as a funtion of K/Kcr for di(cid:27)erent (cid:28)eld strengths B/a.u.

The ritial point X(Kcr) orresponds to the vertex where X1 (lower graph) and X2 (upper graph)

meet.

The underlying idea is to prepare an atom with low K (requiring a slow CM motion), and

use the eletri (cid:28)eld E to ontrol the ritial parameter. This way an initially prepared

Coulomb-Rydberg state is transformed into a deentered state loalized in the extremum.

To gain a better understanding of the two solutions, their behavior is illustrated in Figure

1. For (cid:28)xed B , both lines meet at the vertex Xc ≡
Kcr/NB . From
there on, the lower branh X1(K) tends to −∞ monotonially (whih we identify with a
proper deentering), whereas the upper urve X2(K) goes to zero (i.e., the deentering gets

X1(Kcr) = X2(Kcr) =

−

lost). For stronger magneti (cid:28)elds, in turn, the `deentering region' around Xc shrinks. We

remark that the deentering is virtually insensitive to the number of eletrons, N .

Let us now wrap up our results. Every stationary eletroni vetor possesses the orthog-

onal deomposition

ri = Xξ + s(0, cos φi, sin φi)T .

This means that all eletrons have a ommon position along ξ(cid:22)whih we refer to as the

deentering(cid:22)while they are on(cid:28)ned to a highly symmetri irular on(cid:28)guration perpen-

diular to ξ . This irular on(cid:28)guration in turn is determined only up to an overall rotation

∆. A generi setup is shown in Figure 2.

The extremal solution exists only if the e(cid:27)etive pseudomomentum K ′ (ontrolled via

IV. NORMAL-MODE ANALYSIS OF N -ELECTRON GIANT DIPOLE STATES

As argued in the previous setion, we expet the stationary on(cid:28)gurations to be andi-

dates for giant dipole resonanes with ertain lifetimes. Preeding a numerial study, we

(cid:28)rst seek to obtain some insight into the loal stability of the system, i.e., their behavior in

the viinity of the extrema. To that end, we will arry out a normal-mode analysis about

these points. More spei(cid:28)ally, we shall onsider the harmoni system

N , one an see a distintion between the modes regarding their behavior as a funtion of K

The ylotron modes roughly pertain to gyrations perpendiular to B, while the Coulomb

motion is predominantly parallel to B. The CM mode is primarily a gyrational mode(cid:22)

re(cid:29)eting the nuleus motion(cid:22), but it also exhibits Coulomb-type ontributions. The zero

mode(cid:22)to be analyzed in more detail below(cid:22)orresponds to the rotation along the stationary

irle identi(cid:28)able in Fig. 5. Lastly, the `deay modes' reveal no striking underlying struture.

16

There are a few subtleties that go beyond the ategorization suggested above. A loser

look at, for instane, the ase of N = 10 eletrons reveals ertain interations among the

di(cid:27)erent modes. Their prinipal auses are rossings between the enter-of-mass mode and

the deay modes (resulting in some striking deformations of the usual line pattern), and

equally avoided rossings of the CM mode with at least some of the Coulomb modes. This

may be taken as a hint at the di(cid:27)erent symmetry relations among the Coulombi and the

deay modes.

The spetra of both the Coulombi Hessian (∂2V )0 and the magneti ontributions (inlud-

ing ω ) are separately invariant under these rotations. Still, their on(cid:29)iting symmetries

guarantee that the dynamis will vary with ∆.

In order to see this dependeny, a semi-log plot of the modes {
interval [0, 2π) is reorded for di(cid:27)erent N (Fig. 6). As before, B = 10−

γρ(∆)

(cid:28)xed. The plots display an obvious symmetry, as rotating by ΦN = 2π/N gives an indis-

tinguishable setup. The ylotroni modes as well as the a(cid:30)liated CM mode are essentially

∆-independent. By ontrast, the Coulomb modes and the deay modes show a pronouned

periodi hange. In addition, one an see avoided rossings in some ases between the CM

mode and the lowest Coulomb mode.

For the ase N = 2 (Figure 6a), whih was found to be loally stable in the vertial

on(cid:28)guration ([? ℄, see also IV B), there is some exeptional behavior whenever ∆ is lose to

this respet, the loal stability we found for N = 2 is appliable only outside the singular

While the ase of three eletrons (N = 3: Fig. 6b) reveals no striking e(cid:27)ets, the spetrum

beomes muh riher when we add another eletron (N = 4: Fig. 7). The four Coulomb

modes as well as two more deay modes reveal an intriguing behavior. There is an avoided

rossing between the CM mode and the lowest Coulomb mode, whih turns into an unstable

real mode in an intermediary region. Also, one an get a sense of the interplay between the

two deay modes.

V. WAVE-PACKET DYNAMICAL STUDY OF THE TWO-ELECTRON CASE

The extensive analysis of the normal modes of N -eletron giant dipole states in the

preeding setion provided evidene that the two-eletron ase is loally stable, apart from

the singular horizontal on(cid:28)guration. We now turn to a numerial study of that system.

It annot be over-emphasized that a six-dimensional resonane study is at the frontier

of what is urrently possible and requires a areful hoie of the omputational approah.

19

This applies espeially in view of the fat that the system is governed by dramatially dif-

ferent time sales. Therefore we adopted the Multi-Con(cid:28)guration Time-Dependent Hartree

(mtdh) method [? ? ? ? ℄, whih is known for its outstanding e(cid:30)ieny in high-

dimensional appliations. To be self-ontained, a onise introdution to this tool is pre-

sented in Subsetion V A. Its basi idea is to solve the time-dependent Shrödinger equation

in a small but time-dependent basis related to Hartree produts. It has to be stressed that

this method is designed for distinguishable partiles. Applying it to a fermioni system like

ours (cid:28)nds its sole justi(cid:28)ation in the fat that the spatial separation between the eletrons

is so large that they are virtually distinguishable.

After some remarks on the sales of the system in Subse. V B, the method will be applied

in Subse. V C. The fous is on stability aspets, i.e., the propagation of wave pakets, but

we also investigate the spetra as well as the in(cid:29)uene of the rotational invariane disussed

in the previous setion.

A. Computational method: mtdh

The prinipal goal of mtdh is to solve the time-dependent Shrödinger equation as an

initial-value problem:

i ˙Ψ = HΨ

.

Ψ(Q, 0) = Ψ0(Q)






(24)

The standard method (see [? ℄ and referenes therein) now approahes the problem by ex-

panding the solution in terms of time-independent primitive basis funtions. Unfortunately,

it exhibits a drasti exponential saling with respet to the number of degrees of freedom f .

Rather than using a large time-independent basis, the Multi-Con(cid:28)guration Time-Dependent

Hartree method (mtdh) employs a time-dependent set, whih is more (cid:29)exible and thus

smal ler. The ansatz for the wave funtion now reads

using a onvenient multi-index notation for the on(cid:28)gurations, J = (j1 . . . jf ), where f
denotes the number of degrees of freedom. The (unknown) single-partile funtions ϕ(κ)

are in turn represented in a primitive basis. Note that both the oe(cid:30)ients AJ and the

enforing that the numerial Hamiltonian be written as a sum of produts of one-

partile operators (separable form). The non-separable part of the Hamiltonian thus

has to be (cid:28)tted to produt form ahead of a omputation.

• Mode ombination : in pratie, one ombines several (say d = 2, 3) degrees of freedom
to a d-partile rather than a one -partile funtion. This approah alleviates the bad

numerial saling for high-dimensional systems.

• Relaxation [? ℄: mtdh provides a way to not only propagate a wave paket, but

also to obtain the lowest eigenstates of the (disretized) system. The underlying idea

is to propagate some wave funtion by the non-unitary time-evolution operator e−

Hτ

(propagation in imaginary time.) In pratie, one relies on a more sophistiated sheme

termed improved relaxation. Here h
i is minimized with respet to both the
oe(cid:30)ients AJ and the on(cid:28)gurations ΦJ . The equations of motion thus obtained are
HΦKi
with (cid:28)xed ΦJ ) and then propagating ΦJ in imaginary time over a short period. The

B. Appliation of mtdh

Let us point out how the omputational method an be applied to our problem. There are

essentially two highly on(cid:29)iting types of motion and orresponding sales: perpendiular

to the magneti (cid:28)eld, we have the magneti length

RB =

1

√µωB ≃

1
√2B

,

employing atomi units. To be spei(cid:28), for a laboratory (cid:28)eld strength B = 10−

4

, the length

sale will be on the order of 102

a.u. As for the paral lel (Coulomb) motion(cid:22)expeted to

take plae roughly in a harmoni potential(cid:22)we an use the usual harmoni-osillator lengths

Z0 = 1/√µωZ , for some `typial' frequeny ωZ . These are roughly on the order of 103

a.u.

(Note that the higher K(cid:22)or E(cid:22) beomes, the smaller will be the Coulomb frequenies,

hene the wave paket will be spread far more over the grid.)

Analogously, the antiipated time sales are

TB =

2π
ωB

B=10−4
≃

1.5 ps

for the ylotroni motion. By ontrast, the harateristi times parallel to B are strongly

K -dependent, and they vary between about 1, 500ps
that the assoiate time sale for the CM mode is asymptotially TCM ≃

−

5, 000 ps.

15, 000ps. For omparison, we mention

For strong (cid:28)elds, the relevant motion will thus ertainly be determined by the magneti

(cid:28)eld(cid:22)at least near the stationary points we are interested in. This would suggest to in-

trodue ylindrial oordinates about the extremum, arrying out our study in the basis

set for the Landau orbitals [? ℄ Rnm(ρ)eimϕ

perpendiular to B, and harmoni-osillator

funtions φnz (z) parallel to the (cid:28)eld. Sine the former set was not available in the mtdh

pakage, we resorted to Cartesian oordinates for the displaements from the extremum Q0

Both T and the `CM-kineti energy' are already in produt form (25), whereas the Coulomb

C. Results and disussion

In our alulations, we were hie(cid:29)y interested in two questions: the stability of the giant

dipole states, and their spetral properties. The (cid:28)rst aspet was studied using propagation

of wave pakets initially loalized at the extremum. Emphasis was plaed on initial states

lose to the assumed `ground states'. Moreover, following the evolution of wave pakets

with an initial displaement from the extremum, we tested the robustness of the resonanes.

For omparison, the eigenvetors of the Hamiltonian will be onsidered using the relaxation

method.

The parameter set was restrited to the following values. B = 10−

4

was (cid:28)xed, beause

hanging the magneti (cid:28)eld strength essentially only a(cid:27)ets the overall sales via the ritial

pseudomomentum and is not expeted to make for ompletely new behavior. The pseudo-

momenta are K/Kcr ∈ {

1.1, 2.0, 10.0

} (we will drop the prime from now on), whih aount

for the ases of a very shallow outer wel l, the medium range and the very deep outer well

(the high-K regime).

For simpliity, the in(cid:29)uene of the rotational invariane will be srutinized a posteriori,

using the harateristi values φ0 = π

2 , 3π

periods of the Coulomb modes and several 10, 000 periods of the rapid ylotron motion.

1. Stability analysis

The approah used in this subsetion is to study the propagation of a 6D harmoni-

osillator wave paket entered within the well. The osillator parameters are adapted so as

to math the borderline ground states, i.e., the ylotron frequenies ωR, ωs for XY (xy), and

a typial Coulomb frequeny ωZ, ωz parallel to the magneti (cid:28)eld. To test the robustness

total deentering.) Also, relaxations (starting from the original, undisplaed wave pakets

above) are arried out to see how the lowest-energy on(cid:28)guration found with this algorithm

di(cid:27)ers from our initial guess. The analysis mostly fouses on the redued densities ρκ (1D or

displays an instability in some degrees of freedom.

Both X and Y revealed weak osillations of two types. As these are generi, they shall be

inspeted in more detail on the example of the X degree of freedom. Three representative

snapshots (Figure 8a) were taken to illustrate this e(cid:27)et. The nature of the osillations

an be explored more easily in Figure 8(b). To begin with, the enter arries out a tiny

osillation about X

20 a.u. with a period of about 6, 400 ps (a snapshot was taken at

≃ −

its (cid:28)rst turning point at 3, 200 ps). This very slow osillation superimposes what we will all

the shape osil lations, materializing in the (cid:29)utuation of the width ∆X(t). That osillation

is about twie as fast, and it reahes its maximum width for the (cid:28)rst time at 1, 600 ps

(Fig. 8a). The relative stability in these two diretions is readily explained in terms of

the generalized potential. Apart from a stabilization by the B (cid:28)eld, they experiene an

additional on(cid:28)nement via the `CM-kineti energy' (5). However, it is evident that the

paket broadens over time, thus slowly deloalizing (Fig. 8b).

Even though the relative motion perpendiular to B, s

(x, y), is also gyrationally

⊥ ≡

stabilized, there is no on(cid:28)ning term for it in the generalized potential as for the ECM. In

fat, a look at the generalized potential (Figure 9b) reveals that Q0 is a saddle point. The y

diretion is the zero mode, while the ut through the x diretion refers to a maximum. In this

light, we annot expet the system to be arbitrarily stable in these two degrees of freedom.

This is a general fat, but for K = 1.1Kcr it is very pronouned. The reason being, near the

extremum, the Coulomb interation (the soure of these instabilities) beomes negligible for

higher K . A line of reasoning losely onneted uses the time sale at whih the instability

will have an impat. As the Coulomb modes Ω(K) inrease dramatially as K

harateristi time T (K) = 2π/Ω(K) beomes muh shorter (f. Table I).

As opposed to the previous paragraph K/Kcr = 1.1, the relative motion in x onveys a

fairly stable if errati impression. Still, the wave paket in y spreads as it did before (Fig.

14). But keep in mind that it ours at a muh greater time sale than in Fig. 11(b): for

example, after 5,000 ps the broadening has only just begun to beome signi(cid:28)ant.

A loser look at the response of the system upon displaing Z and z by 2, 000 a.u. unveils

that for the exited degrees themselves, Z and z , the wave paket is simply re(cid:29)eted between

e(cid:27)et on the (xy) modes. In fat, x is rendered slightly unstable by the exitation of the

parallel motion. The snapshots taken at 20,000 ps and 50,000 ps, respetively, doument

how the wave paket slowly but inevitably starts leaking, Fig. 15(-d). The lifetime of the

y mode is not drastially hanged altogether.

We also investigated the supposed ground state obtained via improved relaxation.

It

is understood that at best the exat system displays a resonane state, so the quest for

eigenstates is meaningful only insomuh as those of the disretized Hamiltonian may be

interpreted as loalized states whih really orrespond to resonanes. Our results turned out

to be very sensitive to both the primitive and the single-partile basis sizes. Nonetheless, for

a high if manageable auray, the pattern that emerged was the following. Apart from some

smaller deviations from the initial state (Landau-orbital / harmoni-osillator produt), a

drasti alteration takes plae in s

(x, y) (Fig. 16). The wave paket is split into two

⊥ ≡

humps that seem to be driven outwards until the basis size is exhausted, while smeared out

along the zero mode y .

This behavior raises the question how that squares with the potential piture, given that

the loal instability haraterized by ω2

wxx/m is muh weaker in magnitude than ω2

B . In

order to larify these issues, we onstruted a 2D model Hamiltonian via the natural inlusion

R=0; z=0 . The study of this toy model, whih is numerially far more amenable,

revealed that it is apable of reovering many of the key features of the full system.

term ωBℓz . To begin with, the instability of the generalized potential in x tempts the paket

to split up and be driven `downhill'. However, if there were no paramagneti term or if

the same instability ourred isotropially, this would have no disernible e(cid:27)et. However,

owing to the anisotropy of V , ℓ is no longer onserved:

It is energetially favorable for the partile to go to ever lower h

Figure 16: A generi relaxation state (K = 2Kcr , see text) (cid:21) plotted is the 2D-redued density for

the plane perpendiular to B : the wave paket is driven away from the x axis with inreasing basis

size.

Note that this e(cid:27)et essentially amounts to the fat that the giant-dipole resonane state is

far from the energetially lowest on(cid:28)guration. That does not pose an immediate onstraint

on the system's lifetime under propagation, sine our initial Landau/harmoni-osillator

state has a virtually zero overlap with the above `relaxation state'. Hene in a propagation,

this `bimodal' relaxation state is not aessible, whih explains why the system is so muh

more stable than its relaxation suggests. Physially speaking, the ylotron gyration (cid:28)eld

stabilizes the motion near the stationary on(cid:28)guration for (cid:28)xed energy and thus inhibits

a deloalized state at a lower energy. (cid:21) This is approved by a 2D numerially exat time

evolution (Fig. 17), whih reveals no breakup for many nanoseonds, until the wave paket

is slightly rotated in the xy plane and split up roughly in the y diretion(cid:22)and not in x as

in the relaxation ase! Note that it aquires a small but non-zero value of h

ontrast to h
after way more than 100 ns that the paket hits the grid's boundary. These outomes seem

gation is on the order of 250 a.u., and the width varies by a fator of two, all at a period

of about Tz . In ontrast with x and any other degree, the width in the y diretion shows a

steady if minute broadening (Fig. 18b). This might be taken for a sign that eventually, the

system is bound to deay. Then again, this takes 300, 000 ps to move by one atomi unit

and is beyond the time sale regarded here.

After having ome a long way to (cid:28)nd the system pratially stable for high enough values

of the pseudo-momentum, we now explore the robustness with respet to displaements.

Skipping the detailed behavior, we (cid:28)nd that the overall stability was not a(cid:27)eted. Due to

both of the paket's enter and its width on the perpendiular degrees of freedom.

Lastly, applying a relaxation revealed similar phenomena as in the previous paragraph.

Regardless of the spei(cid:28) shape of the relaxation state, it an be reasoned that the insta-

bilities of ourse still underlie the system, but that the lifetimes for su(cid:30)iently large K are

too large to be observed in our propagation.

2.

In(cid:29)uene of the rotational freedom

To omplete the disussion, let us now investigate the giant dipole states for di(cid:27)erent

settings of the extremal angle φ0 of the relative oordinate s0 on the irle. So far, the fous

was on φ0 = π/2 only (or, equivalently, ∆ =

π
2 ), whih we referred to as the `vertial

−

on(cid:28)guration'. In the normal-mode analysis, however, we found an interesting frequeny

pattern as we varied this extremal angle.

It was argued that eah φ0 orresponds to a

di(cid:27)erent extremal point, i.e., for eah value of (B, K) there is really a one-parameter lass

of extremal points Q(φ0) with di(cid:27)erent stability and spetral properties.

As examples, we thus investigate both the supposedly unstable `horizontal on(cid:28)guration'

φ0 = π (∆ = 0) and a `diagonal on(cid:28)guration' φ0 = 3

π/4), as visualized in Figure

4π (∆ =

−

19. This was done for the speial ases of K/Kcr = 2, 10.

Figure 20: The horizontal on(cid:28)guration φ0 = π (K/Kcr = 10). The wave paket swithes between

two positions (snapshots of redued density for 11,500 ps and 20,000 ps).

To sum up our (cid:28)ndings, the horizontal on(cid:28)guration indeed adds an instability, whih

is disernible even for very high K , if less distint. The diagonal on(cid:28)guration was partly

unstable on a timesale omparable to that of the vertial ase, T

104 ps. A rotation of

∼

the extremum obviously rotates the zero mode, too, whih is why the detailed dynamis is

a di(cid:27)erent one for the relative degrees of freedom. For instane, in ase that φ0 = π , the

zero mode points along the z diretion, whih would otherwise live in a harmoni potential.

As a onsequene, even for K/Kcr = 10 the z -paket (prepared with a non-zero frequeny

ωz = 10−

8a.u.) smoothly osillates between its initial and a muh more smeared-out state

aording to Fig. 20.

3. Spetrum

We (cid:28)nally look into some spetral properties of the GDS for the di(cid:27)erent values of K/Kcr .

The spetrum alulated from a propagation for K/Kcr = 1.1 (Fig. 21) looks somewhat

fuzzy, but the main peak is still distint enough to vaguely resemble a resonane. The

situation is less ambiguous in the ase K/Kcr = 2 , as the `deay' ours on a muh greater

time sale. The spetrum in Fig. 22 illustrates the resonane harater of the system. Our

initial wave paket gives a peak at E

0.281 meV, whereas the `displaed state' with
i0 = 2, 000 a.u. produes a rather interesting exitation spetrum (same (cid:28)gure),

i0 =

revealing overlaps with many eigenstates. The equidistant spaing of the peaks might be

interpreted as a signature of harmoniity in both exitations (Z, z). Finally, in the most

that K/Kcr = 10 is quasi-stable.

VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have studied the internal motion of N -eletron atoms in rossed magneti and eletri

(cid:28)elds utilizing the generalized potential. For eletri (cid:28)elds above a ritial value, a strongly

deentered potential well forms. It supports giant dipole states where the eletrons' enter of

mass is aligned along the eletri (cid:28)eld, with all eletrons in a symmetri irular on(cid:28)guration

35

in the orthogonal plane. These states have been investigated for an arbitrary number of

eletrons in a normal-mode analysis, and numerially for the ase of two-eletron giant

dipole states employing wave-paket propagation.

The normal-mode analysis of the N -eletron atoms leads to a quadrati eigenvalue prob-

lem. Its eigenmodes (as well as the eigenvetors) have been studied depending on the (cid:28)eld

strengths B, E as well as the eletron number N . A subsequent lassi(cid:28)ation aording to

their harateristis indiated that the 3N modes were grouped into N ylotron modes and

N Coulomb modes, orresponding mostly to the motion indued by the magneti (cid:28)eld and

the Coulomb potential, respetively. Moreover, we found a CM mode re(cid:29)eting the enter-of-

mass gyration in the magneti (cid:28)eld, as well as a zero mode referring to a rotational invariane

of the extremal on(cid:28)guration, also studied in detail. The residual modes were termed deay

modes on aount of their peuliar behavior suggesting instability for atoms with three or

more eletrons. Their absene for the system N = 2 provided a strong indiation of loal

stability, with the single exeption of the so-alled horizontal on(cid:28)guration.

In the seond part of the present work, an ab-initio simulation of the six-dimensional

two-eletron system was performed. Sine this type of investigation an be viewed as the

state of the art of what is numerially feasible, we resorted to the Multi-Con(cid:28)guration

Time-Dependent Hartree (mtdh) method, a wave-paket dynamis tool known for its

unique e(cid:30)ieny in higher dimensions. Both the stability of the six degrees of freedom and

some spetral properties have been examined. To establish the link to the normal-mode

analysis, the in(cid:29)uene of the rotational freedom of the irular on(cid:28)guration has also been

investigated. We (cid:28)nd that the stability of the system strongly inreases for larger eletri

(cid:28)elds. For a (cid:28)eld strength twie the ritial value, some modes experiene a deay on the

time sale of 104

105 ps; for the tenfold ritial value, there is no instablity on the sale we

onsidered, i.e., 105 ps. These states proved rather robust against perturbations, simulated

−

by displaements parallel to the magneti (cid:28)eld, where the motion is not gyrationally

stabilized. As antiipated, the stability of the giant dipole states turned out to apply only

outside the singular `horizontal on(cid:28)guration' of the extremum.

While the investigation into the loal aspets of stability an be regarded as somewhat

ompleted, a rigorous numerial analysis is to date limited with an eye toward time and

omputational e(cid:27)ort. First and foremost, the mtdh alulations set up so far ould in

36

priniple be modi(cid:28)ed to the ase of N

3 eletrons. However, this appears to be a massive

≥

numerial hallenge, sine the mtdh method is slowed down signi(cid:28)antly the more degrees

of freedom are involved. One approah to irumvent this would be an adiabati separation

similar to [? ℄, amounting to an average over the rapid ylotron motion. This would allow

for a signi(cid:28)antly faster integration. For future investigations, it may also be bene(cid:28)ial

for short-time propagations to implement a disrete-variable representation of the Landau

orbitals in mtdh.

Apart from these questions, onerned with a wider range of appliation and e(cid:30)ieny,

the task arises to make the analysis more quantitative. A systemati resonane alulation

yielding both the energy levels and deay widths of the giant-dipole states is desirable, but

has so far proven to be a severe hallenge omputationally due to the type of instability. It

might also yield a deeper understanding of the resonane wave funtions. Ultimately, one

ould even go so far as to simulate the preparation of giant dipole states, migrating from the

Coulomb well to the deentered extremum. In analogy to the sheme suggested for single

eletrons [? ℄, this may serve as a bridge to the experimental veri(cid:28)ation of giant dipole

resonanes.

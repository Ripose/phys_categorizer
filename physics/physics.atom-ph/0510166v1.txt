Abstract

We show that a low ﬁnesse cavity can be eﬃcient for detecting neutral atoms. The low ﬁnesse can

be compensated for by decreasing the mode waist of the cavity. We have used a near concentric

resonator with a beam waist of 12µm and a ﬁnesse of only 1100 to detect magnetically guided

Rb atoms with a detection sensitivity of 0.1 atom in the mode volume. For future experiments on

single atom detection and cavity QED applications, it should be very beneﬁcial to use miniaturized

optical resonator integrated on atom chips.

It is highly desirable to detect atoms with high eﬃciency and good spatial resolution

both for fundamental physical experiments[1] and for applications in quantum information

processing[2]. This task is usually accomplished by using high ﬁnesse cavities, where the

photons interact strongly with the atoms.
In such experiments it has been possible to
monitor the motion of single atoms inside a high ﬁnesse (F > 2 × 105) cavity[3]. By

performing feedback to the optical beam passing through the resonator it has been possible

to control the atomic motion inside the cavity to form bound atom-photon states. This also
requires a high ﬁnesse (F > 4 × 105) resonator[4].

In this article we wish to explore the possibilities to perform atom detection using optical

cavities with moderate ﬁnesse[5]. The main result is that the ﬁnesse F is not the most

important aspect of cavity assisted detection schemes, equally important is the ratio between
the atomic absorption cross section σatom = 3λ2/2π and the beam cross section inside the
cavity A = π

4 w2
0.

For each round trip the photon is absorbed with a probability σatom/A. A ﬁgure of merit

for absorption inside the cavity is therefore

C1 =

F
2π

σatom
A

.

(1)

where F
2π is the number of round trips for a photon. This quantity is identical to the
cooperativity parameter C1 = g2
2κγ , which relates the time scales of the coherent dynamics
of the coupled system g−1
to the time scales of incoherent decays of cavity ﬁeld κ−1 and
0
atomic excitation γ−1. This is also related to the Purcell factor η = 2C1 that determines

0

the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate into the cavity mode over the free space

value[1, 6]. Looking at Eqn. (1) one clearly sees that a reduced cavity mode waist can

compensate for a small cavity ﬁnesse.

In this spirit it has been proposed by Horak et al. that a single atom detection in low

ﬁnesse can be achieved by strongly focussing the cavity mode[5]. When the cooperativity

parameter is smaller than one and the atomic saturation is low the signal-to-noise ratio for

a single atom detection becomes

where jin is the incident photon ﬂux, τ the measurement interval, κT the mirror transmission

rate, and κ the overall cavity decay rate[5]. For a ﬁxed measurement time an increased signal-

to-noise ratio can be obtained by increasing the cooperativity parameter. This can be done

by increasing the cavity ﬁnesse, or by decreasing the beam waist. Here we explore the latter

case, when the beam cross section is reduced.

To achieve this we use a nearly concentric cavity geometry. Our cavity was formed by

two identical mirrors with radius of curvature R separated by a distance L. The beam waist
w0 in the cavity center is given by w2

L(2R − L). The concentric geometry occurs

p
when the mirror separation L approaches the value 2R. The waist size w0 becomes small
but the beam size on the cavity mirrors w2 = Rλ

2R−L becomes large as one approaches

L

0 = λ
2π

π q

the concentric limit.

A large mirror spot size requires very uniform mirrors as deviations from a spherical

mirror shape will lower the optical ﬁnesse drastically. Furthermore, as the concentric point

is approached, the cavity also becomes extremely sensitive to misalignments and vibrations.

For more details on this cavity we refer to Siegman[7].

Table I summarizes parameters for nearly concentric cavities and shows that it is not

stringently necessary to have C1 > 1 to detect the presence of a single atom within the

cavity mode.

These considerations all concern the coupling of a single atom to a cavity. This can be

generalized to the many atom case by introducing a many-atom cooperativity parameter

C = NeﬀC1, where Neﬀ is an eﬀective number of atoms in the cavity mode[8], which takes

into account the spatial dependency of the coupling constant g(~r) = g0ψ(~r), given by the

cavity mode function ψ(~r), and the atomic density distribution ρ(~r). The fraction of the

total atom number N which is maximally coupled to the cavity mode is given by the overlap

integral of both functions

Neﬀ = N

Z

d3r ρ(~r)|ψ(~r)|2.

(2)

The absorptive and dispersive eﬀect of the atoms on the cavity amplitude[5] scale linearly

with this eﬀective atom number as long as the atomic saturation is low.

To explore atom detection with low ﬁnesse cavities experimentally, we built a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) for 85Rb atoms approximately 20mm above the cavity center (see Fig.
1). It contained ∼ 107 atoms at a temperature of 35µK. From the MOT we proceeded in

two diﬀerent ways. Either we switched oﬀ the trap completely and monitored the atomic

cloud as it fell freely through the cavity, or we transfered the atoms to a magnetic wire

guide that channeled the atoms through the cavity[9]. The magnetic guide was formed by

a current-carrying wire, attached to the cavity mounting in vertical direction (see Fig. 1b)

3

and a homogeneous magnetic bias ﬁeld in the direction of the optical axis of the cavity. In

this conﬁguration a two dimensional quadrupole guide was formed. The depth, conﬁnement,

and position was controlled by varying the wire current and the magnetic bias ﬁeld[9, 10].

To keep the cavity aligned, we mounted one of the mirrors on a piezoelectric tripod that

allowed us to adjust the optical axis of the cavity. This mirror was aligned to keep the

TEM00 mode centered on the cavity axis. The second mirror was mounted on a translating

piezoelectric stage for wavelength tuning. Feedback to this piezo actuator was generated

using the Pound-Drever-Hall technique[11] to lock the cavity on the laser beam passing

through the cavity. Figure 2 illustrates how the cavity ﬁnesse was reduced as the concentric

point was approached for our cavity. We used two mirrors with R = 10mm and transmission
T = 10−3. For a mirror separation far less than the concentric limit these mirrors yielded

a ﬁnesse of 3000. This ﬁnesse dropped to 1100 when the separation was 70µm from the

concentric point as discussed in the introduction. The cavity mode waist was 12.1µm for

this separation.

We monitored the light intensity transmitted through with an ampliﬁed photodiode for

high light intensities or with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) for low light intensities. The

PMT provided a near shot-noise limited detection. The low-noise electronic ampliﬁcation

limited the detection bandwidth to 20kHz. The main source of technical noise in our setup

was due to mechanical vibrations of the vacuum chamber that held the cavity.

The drop in the cavity transmission signal from freely falling atoms is plotted in Fig. 3a).

Diﬀerent curves manifest diﬀerent pump powers corresponding to empty cavity transmissions
between 1pW and 60pW. The atom number in the MOT is 1.5 × 107, the signal drops by

90% as long as the atomic transition is not saturated (Fig. 3b). Fitting this data with

the theoretical model[8], one obtains an eﬀective atom number Neﬀ = 2.5 ± 0.5. This was

consistent with an independent atom number measurement based on ﬂorescence imaging.

To explore the sensitivity limit of the cavity detector, the atom number in the MOT was

successively reduced until the signal drop due to the atoms was overshadowed by the noise.
When the MOT contained 3.5 × 105 atoms this produced a signal drop of approximately

10%. We consider this to be the resolution limit. A theoretical ﬁt results in an eﬀective

atom number of Neﬀ = 0.1 ± 0.05.

As a next step, atoms were magnetically guided to the cavity center using the wire guide

(see Fig. 1). By changing the current in the guiding wire the overlap between the atoms and

4

the cavity mode could be adjusted. In Fig. 4 we plot the cavity transmission as the position

of the magnetic guide is varied across the cavity mode. As the atomic overlap with the

cavity mode was increased, we observed a increased drop in cavity transmission. From the

duration of the transmission drop the temperature of the guided atoms could be determined

to be 25µK.

The density distribution for the atoms was much larger than the Rayleigh volume of

the cavity, consequently it was not possible to distinguish individual atoms in the guide

using our low ﬁnesse cavity. This cavity would however show a detectable change in the

transmission signal if a single atom would cross the region of maximum coupling as Neﬀ

can be as small as 0.1. The precision in the positioning can be improved using magnetic

microtraps, e.g. produced by atom chip surface traps[12]. On the atom chip one can also

build small integrated cavities[13] with mode waists as small as 2µm. This relaxes the

requirements on the ﬁnesse even further[5]. To achieve the same detection sensitivity with

a beam waist of 2µm a ﬁnesse of 40 is enough.

To conclude, we have illustrated that it is possible to detect magnetically guided atoms

using a low ﬁnesse cavity with small mode waist. The small waist allowed us to detect atoms

with high sensitivity, as illustrated in Fig. 3. We also show that high spatial resolution can

be achieved. We demonstrate this by detecting magnetically guided atoms, as illustrated in

Fig. 4. A natural development would be to miniaturize the cavity even further and integrate

it on an atom chip[5, 13, 14, 15, 16].

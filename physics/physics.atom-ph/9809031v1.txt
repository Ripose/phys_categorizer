Experiments with dielectric scatterers in a parallel-plate waveguide have veriﬁed for the ﬁrst time
the existence of proximity resonances in two dimensions. A numerical solution to the scattering
problem supports the analysis of the experimental data.

It has recently been shown that two resonant s-wave scatterers placed close together produce two resonances in the
spectrum of the combined system [1]. The ﬁrst, which remains s-wave in character, is shifted down in energy and
broadened with respect to the original single scatterer resonance. The second resonance, which is p-wave in character,
is shifted up an equal amount in energy and can have a very narrow width. In fact, the width of the p-wave resonance
vanishes as the scatterers approach each other. This second resonance has been dubbed the proximity resonance.

Proximity resonances are important in a number of physical contexts, including scattering of sound from small
identical bubbles in liquids [2,3], and scattering and emission of light from nearby dipole scatterers [4,5] where a
proximity resonance eﬀect has long been known under the name of Dicke super-radiance and sub-radiance. In Ref.
[1], the eﬀect was discussed for particle scattering from two identical atoms (or other identical scatterers) for the ﬁrst
time. Here we discuss yet another context, the classical scattering of electromagnetic waves from dielectric discs. At
the same time (however see the caveat below) the system we describe mimics quantum scattering from two adjacent
potential wells in two dimensions [6,7].

For the purposes of modeling the experiment, we developed a method of solving the scattering problem involving
cylindrical basis functions centered on each disc. It turned out that the point scatterer model [8,9], which was used
in the original discussion of proximity resonances [1], was not suﬃcient to accurately model the experiment. In order
for the point scatterer model to be applicable, at least two conditions must be met: r
d, where r is the
physical radius of each scatterer, λ the wavelength, and d the distance between the scatterers. In our experiments,
the ﬁrst condition was always met, but the second was not.

Other work [10] indicates that there may be a similar eﬀect present in the bound state spectrum of two nearby
dielectric discs in a parallel-plate waveguide. Szmytkowski et al. [11] have found theoretically a similar resonance with
ﬁxed scattering length point interactions.

The picture to keep in mind when thinking about the proximity resonance is the following: imagine two nearby
point sources of unit amplitude, situated much closer together than a wavelength. When these sources are in phase,
amplitude will add up nearly in phase everywhere in space, and the amplitude far from the sources will be appreciable.
The far ﬁeld intensity clearly will be s-wave in character. When the sources are out of phase, amplitude will interfere
destructively everywhere, and the far ﬁeld intensity will be much reduced compared to the in-phase case. Now, for
a scattering resonance, the width of the resonance is proportional to the rate at which amplitude escapes from the
2, where ψfar is the far ﬁeld
neighborhood of the scattering system. This rate is proportional to the ratio
amplitude and ψnear is the amplitude in the near ﬁeld. This ratio will remain ﬁnite for the in-phase pair of scatterers,
and vanish for the out of phase pair, as their separation goes to zero. This narrows the proximity resonance as the
scatterers are brought closer together.

The waveguide, shown in Fig. 1, consisted of two parallel copper plates, 1 m square, separated by a 1 cm gap. To
minimize the eﬀect of waves reﬂected oﬀ the edges of the waveguide, the perimeter was lined with a 11.5 cm thick layer
of microwave absorber (C-RAM LF-79, Cuming Microwave Corp.), designed to provide 20 dB of attenuation in the
reﬂected wave intensity at frequencies above 600 MHz. Without the absorber, there would be substantial reﬂections
of both the incident and scattered wave oﬀ the edges of the waveguide, which would produce strong cavity modes and
unnecessarily complicate the analysis. The important eﬀect of the absorber was to allow the waveguide to behave as
if it were inﬁnite in extent in the directions parallel to the plates, and thus support oscillations at all frequencies.

The scatterers were cylindrical in shape (radius: 2 mm, height: 1 cm) and had a measured dielectric constant of
ǫ = 77
1. Each disc had an individual s-wave scattering resonance at 2.3 GHz with a 1.1 GHz width. They were
illuminated with microwaves from a point source located 25 cm away from the midpoint of the two scatterers. The
ﬁeld in the waveguide could be measured at eight points located on a circle of 25 cm radius centered at the midpoint
between the scatterers.

±

Antennae were inserted perpendicular to the plates to launch the incident wave and measure the ﬁeld. Such
antennae couple to an electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the plates. For a plate separation of 1 cm and frequencies below

1

15 GHz (the experiment operated between 1-3 GHz), only the TEM (transverse electromagnetic) mode propagates
in the waveguide, and all others are evanescent. The classiﬁcation TEM means that, for this mode, both ~E and ~H
are transverse to the direction of propogation. In particular, ~E is everywhere perpendicular to the plates, and ~H is
(ω/c)2, for the mode
everywhere parallel to the plates. As an example, we calculate the decay constant, κ =
3 cm−1. This
with one oscillation transverse to the plates at 3 GHz. With kz = π/L and L = 1 cm, we ﬁnd κ
means that this mode has decayed by a factor e−75 over a distance of 25 cm, the distance between the source and the
scatterers. Thus we may safely ignore all modes but the TEM mode for the purpose of this work.

As mentioned above, for the TEM mode both ~E and ~H are transverse to the direction of propagation, just as for
a plane wave in free space. In fact, a useful visualization of this mode in the waveguide is just a section of an inﬁnite
plane wave, ~E0ei~k·~r, with wave vector ~k parallel, and electric ﬁeld ~E0 normal to the plates. Furthermore, the TEM
mode has no variation of the ﬁelds in the direction perpendicular to the plates and is thus truly two dimensional
[12]. In fact, the entire ﬁeld structure
can be derived from knowledge of Ez(x, y) alone [13], where
z is understood to be the direction perpendicular to the plates. Furthermore, for the TEM mode, the boundary
conditions on Ez at the dielectric surface are identical to those of a quantum mechanical square well: Ez and its
normal derivative, ∂nEz, must be continuous across the interface. Thus the component Ez in the waveguide plays the
role of ψ in a two dimensional quantum mechanical system. Henceforth we will refer to Ez as ψ.

However, there remains one important diﬀerence between dielectrics and quantum mechanical square wells.

In

quantum mechanics, the ratio of wavenumbers inside and outside the well is

where V is the well depth and E is the energy. Note that this ratio depends on E, and diverges at low energy. In the
electromagnetic case, this ratio is a constant, and equal to the index of refraction:

This means that a system of quantum square wells can only be compared with an equivalent system of dielectric discs
at a particular energy. If the energy is changed, ǫ must also be changed to retain correspondence.

The measured signal was compared to the source signal in both amplitude and phase with a HP 8714C network
analyzer. Because both amplitude and phase could be measured, it was possible to extract the (complex) scattered
wave, ψs from the full signal, ψ = ψ0 + ψs, where ψ0 is the incident wave. This was done by removing the scatterers
from the waveguide and repeating the measurement, yielding ψ0. This result was then subtracted from the full wave
to yield the scattered wave signal.

The full solution to the scattering problem of a single dielectric disc in a parallel plate waveguide can be found
analytically [14]. The two disc problem, however, becomes diﬃcult because of the lack of cylindrical symmetry. We
address this diﬃculty by using a basis which reﬂects the broken symmetry of the problem: two sets of Bessel functions,
each centered on one of the discs. This method is similar in spirit to that of Goell [15]. Referring to Fig. 2, we have
in regions I, II, and III, respectively,

ψI =

where Jl(x) and H (1)
(x) are Bessel functions and Hankel functions of the ﬁrst kind, ψ0 is a TEM incident wave,
κ = √ǫ k, and lmax determines the size of the basis set. Note that the variable z does not appear in the above
equations, because for the TEM mode there is no z dependence of the ﬁelds. An exact solution would require that

be determined by matching ψ and its normal derivative ∂nψ along the perimeter of each disc.

. However, we ﬁnd very good solutions for lmax as small as 5. The complex constants Al, Bl, Cl, Dl are to

The exact solution would require matching

at all points along the boundary of each disc. In practice,
one can only match at a ﬁnite number of points. From each matching point, one obtains two equations relating
the constants Al, Bl, Cl, Dl. The entire collection of matching equations can be expressed in matrix form, M x = b,
where the number of rows and columns of M is determined by the number of matching points and basis functions,
respectively. The vector x is built up of the coeﬃcients Al, Bl, Cl, Dl, and b is determined by the incident wave
ψ0. In general, one chooses more matching points than basis functions, so that the solution x minimizes the length
r =
. This minimization is eﬃciently carried out by ﬁnding the singular value decomposition of the matrix

M [16]. The residual r provides an indication of the accuracy of the solution. For this work, typical values or r were
10−10 per matching point. This is to be compared with values of
of order unity on the perimeters of
the discs.

In Fig. 3 we plot the scattered amplitude

measured at position 7 (see Fig. 1). The theoretical
ψ0|
result agrees very well, apart from a weak 0.3 GHz modulation of the experimental signal due to reﬂections oﬀ the
absorbing walls of the waveguide. The numerical data was generated using lmax = 5 and matching at 10 equally
spaced locations around each disc. The broad feature centered around 2.0 GHz is the s-wave (in phase) resonance. A
strong proximity resonance is apparent at around 2.8 GHz. The width of this peak is smaller by a factor of 7 than the
single scatterer s-wave resonance width. We also checked that this peak was indeed p-wave in character by measuring
the angular dependence of the scattered wave in the vicinity of 2.8 GHz. Notably, the peak was absent when the
measuring antenna was placed on the line equidistant from each disc, which deﬁnes a nodal line of the scattered wave
for a p-wave resonance.

In Figs. 4, 5 we plot the peak position and width, respectively, of the proximity resonance as a function of disc
separation. Again the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the data. For comparison, we also include
the predictions of the cruder point scatterer model, using as input parameters a single scatterer resonance frequency
f0 = 2.3 GHz and width of Γ0 = 1.1 GHz. It can be shown that within this model, the proximity resonance peak
position f and width Γ obey the following formulae,

f = f0 −

Γ0

Y0(k0d) , Γ = Γ0 (1

J0(k0d)) ,

where J0 is a zeroth order Bessel function, Y0 is a zeroth order Neumann function, k0 is the on-resonance wave
number of a single scatterer, and d is the distance between the scatterers. The point scatterer model does a good job
of tracking the peak positions, but the resonance widths are not described well by the model.

In summary, we have, for the ﬁrst time, observed proximity resonances in a two dimensional system. The analysis
of the experimental data seems to be well supported by a numerical solution to the scattering problem. Immediate
extensions of the ideas presented here include increasing the number of scatterers to look for even narrower resonances,
which would be associated with higher angular momentum scattered waves (d-waves, for example). The spectrum of
a dense (compared to a wavelength), ordered array of s-wave resonant scatterers is also an interesting system as it
relates to band structure formation.

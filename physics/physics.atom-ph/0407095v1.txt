Construction of accurate Kohn-Sham potentials for the lowest states of
the helium atom: Accurate test of the ionization-potential theorem

Accurate local Kohn-Sham potentials have been constructed for the ground 1s2 1S state and, in
particular, for the lowest triplet 1s2s 3S state of the helium atom, using electron densities from
many-body calculations and the procedure of van Leeuwen and Baerends (Phys. Rev. A49, 2138
(1994)). The resulting Kohn-Sham orbitals reproduce the many-body densities very accurately, and
furthermore we have demonstrated that the negative of the energy eigenvalue of the outermost elec-
tron orbital agrees with the corresponding ionization energy with extreme accuracy. The procedure
is also applied to the Hartree-Fock density of the 1s2s 3S state, and the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue of
the 2s orbital is found to agree very well with the corresponding Hartree-Fock eigenvalue, which is
the negative of the ionization energy in this model due to Koopmans’ theorem. The results for the
1s2s 3S state clearly demonstrate that there is no conﬂict between the locality of the Kohn-Sham
potential and the exclusion principle, as claimed by Nesbet (Phys. Rev. A58, R12 (1998)).

According to the Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem [1, 2, 3], the energy of any electronic system

can be expressed as a functional of the electron density, ρ(r),

where v(r) is the external potential and FHK[ρ] is the universal HK functional, which in the
constrained-search formulation is [4, 5]

Here, ˆT is the kinetic-energy and ˆW the electron-electron-interaction operators of the system (in
atomic units),

The wave function, Ψ, is normalized and belongs to the Sobolev space H 1(R3N ) [5, 6], and the
corresponding functional is deﬁned for all N -representable densities [3]. The ground-state energy
of the system is obtained by minimizing the energy functional over these densities [3],

This leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation

E0 = minρ→N E[ρ] = E[ρ0].

In the Kohn-Sham (KS) model the interacting system is replaced by a system of noninteracting

is the electron density. The kinetic-energy functional is

where Φ = det{φi} is a single Slater-determinantal wave function. Minimizing this functional leads
to the Euler-Lagrange equation

Comparing with Eq. (5), leads – apart from an additive constant – to the relation

The Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham model was originally proven for the ground state but it was demon-
strated by Gunnarsson and Lundqvist [8] that it is valid also for the lowest state of a given
symmetry. Later it has been shown to hold also for more general excited states [9, 10].

Although the form of the KS potential is generally not known, it can be constructed with
arbitrary accuracy in cases where the electron density is known from other sources, e.g., from
experiments or from ab initio calculations. Essentially two schemes have been developed for this
purpose, by Zhao and Parr [11, 12, 13] and by van Leeuwen and Baerends [14], respectively.

The KS orbitals were originally assumed to have no other physical signiﬁcance than generating
the exact electron density, but it was later found by Perdew et al. [15, 16, 17] and independently
by Almbladh and Pendroza [18] that the eigenvalue of the outermost electron (with opposite sign)
equals the ionization energy of the system. Perdew et al. have shown that considering densities
that integrate to non-integrals,

M =

Z

dr ρ(r),

(12)

the theorem holds in the range N − 1 < M < N and hence when this number approaches N from
below. This condition is known as the ionization-potential theorem [17].

The validity of the ionization-potential theorem has been challenged by Kleinman [19] with
counterarguments supplied by Perdew and Levy [17]. A number of numerical veriﬁcations of the
theorem have been performed in the past [14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], generally with low
or moderate accuracy due to problems in representing the density accurately using an analytical
basis set [13, 23]. In the present work we use a numerical basis set, which has made it possible to
demonstrate the validity of the theorem with much higher accuracy than in any previous calculation
known to us [45].

The construction of the KS potential from the electron density has so far mainly been performed
for atomic and molecular ground states. Recently, however, Harbola [27] has constructed the
potential for the ﬁrst excited singlet state, 1s2s 1S, of the helium atom.

Our primary goal for the present work has been to construct the KS potential for an excited
triplet state, which, as far as we know, has not been done before. It has been rigorously shown
that the KS potential is under general conditions strictly local [5, 6, 28, 29], and this has also
been demonstrated in some of our previous works [30, 31, 32]. Nevertheless, this fact has been
disputed in several papers by Nesbet [33, 34, 35], who claims that the locality condition is in conﬂict
with the exclusion principle. In the helium triplet state the two electrons can have the same spin
orientation, and therefore our result represents a ﬁnal rebuttal of the objection of Nesbet.

II. CONSTRUCTION OF THE KOHN-SHAM POTENTIAL FROM ELECTRON
DENSITY

In the present work we apply the scheme of van Leeuwen and Baerends to construct accurate
KS potentials for the lowest states of the helium atom. Following van Leeuwen and Baerends, we
i (r) and summing over the N
obtain after multiplying the KS equations (6) from the left by φ∗

III. MANY-BODY THEORY

The many-body electron density needed for this procedure has been evaluated by means of many-
body perturbation technique [36], using the nonrelativistic pair-correlation program developed by
Salomonson and ¨Oster [37]. We shall brieﬂy indicate this procedure here.

We want to solve the Schr¨odinger equation

and partition the Hamiltonian into a zeroth-order hamiltonian and a perturbation

We start from a zeroth-order or model function Ψ0, which is an eigenfunction of H0,

H Ψ = E Ψ

H = H0 + H ′.

H0 Ψ0 = E0 Ψ0.

contain only a single model state, Ψ0. Only so-called linked diagrams will contribute according to
the linked-diagram theorem [36].

Using second quantization, the wave operator can be separated into normal-ordered one-, two-,..

For heliumlike systems, starting from hydrogenlike orbitals, the wave operator can be expressed

where the energy shift, ∆E, is in this case given by

∆E = hΨ0|H ′Ω|Ψ0i = hΨ0|W2|Ψ0i

and represented graphically by all ’closed’ two-body diagrams, as indicated at the bottom part of
Fig. 1. Since the ﬁnal state of the ionization process is in our cases the ground state of the He+
ion, with the exact nonrelativistic energy of -2 H, the binding energy of the outermost electron
becomes (in atomic units)

BE = −2 − E.

In the present work the pair equation (26) has been solved, using the numerical procedure devel-
oped by Salomonson and ¨Oster [37], and densities for the 1s2 1S ground state and the lowest triplet
state, 1s2s 3S, of the helium atom have been evaluated. These densities are then used to construct
the corresponding KS potentials, as discussed above. The wave functions obtained in this way are
virtually exact, apart from relativistic, mass-polarization and quantum-electrodynamical eﬀects.
In a similar fashion we have also used the Hartree-Fock density to construct the corresponding KS
potential.

It can be argued that the procedure used here corresponds to approaching the electron-density
integral (12) to the electron number from below, M → N −0 [17], and hence the ionization-potential
theorem can be tested.

In order to achieve good accuracy, particularly for the eigenvalue of the outermost electron
orbital, it is important to have the exact density in an accurate form and to have this density well
reproduced by the Kohn-Sham orbitals. In the present work we have generated the many-body
density using a large numerical grid, and the convergence criteria are set so that the Kohn-Sham
density should not deviate from the many-body density by more than one part in 109 at any point.
The convergence rate was usually quite slow, and several thousands of iterations were often needed
to reach this level of accuracy. To improve the convergence rate and avoid ’oscillations’, it was
sometimes helpful to take some average of the last two iterations as the input for the next one.
It is also important to keep the electronic part, vel, of the KS-potential positive at all points by
adjusting the constant in Eq. (15). After the iteration procedure was completed, the constant is
determined so that the potential approaches zero as r → ∞.

discrete linear lattice with equally spaced points with x typically ranging from xmin = −11 to
about xmax = 4. For the triplet state at least four diﬀerent grids were used, and the results
extrapolated in the standard way. Also the end point of the grid, xmax, is varied, as it was
found that the Kohn-Sham results were quite sensitive to that value (See Fig. 6), most likely due
to the fact that our pair functions are forced to be zero at the end point. This has very little

eﬀect on standard many-body calculations, but the KS eigenvalue depends strongly upon the tail
of the density distribution and therefore more aﬀected by the boundary condition. Hence, an
extrapolation of xmax is required in the KS case. It is likely that the results could be improved by
more sophisticated boundary conditions.

In the evaluation of the many-body electron density a partial-wave expansion is used [37], nor-
mally up to lmax = 10, and an extrapolation performed in the standard way. In our procedure,
however, the Kohn-Sham potential is evaluated for successive truncations of the partial-wave ex-
pansion, and the above-mentioned ionization-potential theorem could be tested for each truncation
separately, as well as after the lmax extrapolation.

A. The many-body density of the helium ground state

As a preliminary test of our procedure, we have applied this to the ground state of the helium
atom, where the Kohn-Sham potential has previously been constructed [23, 27]. The electron
density obtained from the KS orbitals is shown in Fig. 2 (dots) superimposed on the many-body
density (dots). In this ﬁgure, the two densities are indistinguishable. The resulting KS potential
is shown in Fig. 3.

These calculations have been performed for a single grid with 201 points, with xmax = 3.6
and lmax = 10 without any extrapolations. The results obtained is then -0.903 7041 H for the
KS 1s eigenvalue and 0.903 7052 H for the many-body ionization energy, which veriﬁes the above-
mentioned ionization-potential theorem to 5-6 digits. By careful extrapolations the pair-correlation
approach yields the value 0.903 724 39 H [37], which agrees well with the very accurate value
obtained by Frankowski and Pekeris [38] and by Freund et al. [39] of 0.903 724 377 H (uncorrected
for relativity, mass-polarization and QED eﬀects).

In the corresponding calculation by Harbola [27], an electron density taken from the litera-
ture [40] was used. Two diﬀerent conﬁgurations, 1s2 1S and 1s2s 1S, respectively, were used, and
the energy eigenvalue of the highest occupied orbital was in both cases found to be 0.899 H.

B. The many-body density of the lowest triplet state of helium

As mentioned, our primary goal of the present work has been to construct the Kohn-Sham
potential from the many-body density for the lowest triplet state, 1s2s 3S, of the helium atom,

and in this case we have performed extensive extrapolations, as we shall demonstrate below.

The ﬁnal KS-density for the 1s2s3S system is shown in Fig. 4 (dots), together with the many-
body density (solid line). The corresponding KS-potential is shown in Fig. 5. It is interesting to
note that the potential has a ’bump’ close to the node of the outermost (valence) electron. This is
typical of this kind of potential and is an eﬀect of the electron self interaction (SIC) [41, 42, 43].

This depends approximately on ρ
val , where ρval is the density of the valence electron, and hence
varies strongly near the node of the valence orbital.

In Table I we show the KS 2s eigenvalue and the corresponding many-body ionization energy
after grid extrapolation with the partial-wave expansion truncated at lmax = 10 and diﬀerent values
of the grid end point, xmax. This extrapolation is illustrated graphically for two values of lmax in
Fig. 6. It is found that the KS eigenvalue is – in contrast to the many-body ionization energy –

quite sensitive to the end point. After the xmax extrapolation, the values are found to agree to
nine digits for each partial wave truncation.

In order to ﬁnd the ”true” values of these quantities, it is necessary also to extrapolate the
partial-wave expansion, with the result shown in Table II. This is illustrated in Fig. 7. These ﬁnal
values represents the nonrelativistic ionization energy, as before uncorrected for mass polarization
as well as for relativistic and QED eﬀects. These values agree to eight digits with the corresponding
value 0,175 229 3782 H, obtained by Pekeris [44].

C. The Hartree-Fock density of the lowest triplet state of helium

As an additional test of the procedure described here, we have applied this also to the Hartree-
Fock density of lowest triplet state of the helium atom. This density is generated by solving the
standard HF equations and then inserted into the generating formula (16) in place of the many-
body density. The resulting densities are quite similar to those given above, as is the resulting KS
potential, since HF is quite a good approximation for this system.

In the HF approximation the orbital eigenvalues correspond exactly to the corresponding ion-
ization energies (with opposite sign), and therefore a comparison of the Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham
(HFKS) 2s eigenvalue with the corresponding HF value would constitute a further test of the
above-mentioned ionization-potential theorem. Here, we found that the agreement is extremely
good without any xmax extrapolation. As an illustration we give the values obtained after grid
extrapolation for xmax = 4, where the HFKS 2s eigenvalue is -0.174 256 072 542 H and the HF
value -0.174 256 072 544 H – an agreement to 11 digits! After complete extrapolations the result
is -0.174 256 0724 H, which is expected to be accurate to 8-9 digits.

V. SUMMARY AND COMMENTS

We have demonstrated that it is possible to construct a local Kohn-Sham potential for the lowest
triplet state of the helium atom with extreme accuracy. The agreement between the absolute values
of the ionization potential and highest-lying KS orbital energy eigenvalue is veriﬁed to nine digits,
which – as far as we know – represents by far the most accurate numerical test of the ionization-
potential theorem performed to date. This result also clearly demonstrates that there is no conﬂict

between the locality theorem and the exclusion principle, as claimed by Nesbet [33, 34, 35].

Ultracold Collisions of Fermionic OD Radicals

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We discuss consequences of Fermi exchange symmetry on collisions of polar molecules at low
temperatures (below 1 K), considering the OD radical as a prototype. At low ﬁelds and low tem-
peratures, Fermi statistics can stabilize a gas of OD molecules against state-changing collisions. We
ﬁnd, however, that this stability does not extend to temperatures high enough to assist with evap-
orative cooling. In addition, we establish that a novel “ﬁeld-linked” resonance state of OD dimers
exists, in analogy with the similar states predicted for bosonic OH.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Cooling and trapping molecules in their ro-vibrational
ground states has proven to be a daunting experimental
task, yet now it has been achieved [1, 2, 3]. Currently, the
samples produced by Stark slowing are limited to tem-
peratures around 1 mK, which is cold enough to trap,
but not yet cold enough for interesting applications to
novel dilute quantum gases of fermions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
or bosons [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. To produce colder,
denser samples for these applications, an attractive ap-
proach may be to use sympathetic cooling with an eas-
ily cooled species (such as Rb) [15], or else evaporative
cooling. Knowledge of collision cross sections is there-
fore essential in understanding prospects for the success
of either approach.

We have previously considered electrostatic trapping of
polar Π-state molecules from the point of view of stability
with respect to collisions [16]. The main bottleneck here
is that electrostatic trapping requires the molecules to be
in a weak-ﬁeld-seeking state, in which case the molecules
of necessity have an even lower-energy strong-ﬁeld seek-
ing state. Collisions involving the strong and anisotropic
dipole-dipole interaction between molecules appear more
than adequate to drive the molecules into these unfa-
vorable states, leading to unacceptably high trap loss
and heating. For this reason, it may be necessary to
seek alternative methods that can conﬁne the strong-
ﬁeld-seeking, absolute lowest-energy ground state of the
molecule using time-varying electric ﬁelds [17, 18, 19, 20].
A recent proposal for an electrodynamic trap is based on
the microwave analogue of the familiar far-oﬀ-resonant
optical dipole trap – only the microwave version doesn’t
have to be far oﬀ-resonance, making the trap very deep
[20].

Polar fermions may have an important advantage for
electrostatic trapping, namely, low inelastic rates at cold
temperatures. Kajita has discussed state-changing colli-
sions of dipolar fermionic molecules [21], based on the
well-known Wigner threshold laws for dipolar interac-
tions. Namely, elastic scattering cross sections are essen-
tially independent of collision energy E at low energies,
but state-changing cross sections scale as E1/2. There-
fore, at “suﬃciently low” temperatures, elastic scatter-
ing always wins, and evaporative cooling should be pos-

sible. Using the Born approximation, Kajita concludes
that this is the case for the molecules OCS and CH3Cl, at
reasonable experimental temperatures [21]. This analysis
may yet prove too optimistic, since the results include re-
gions where the Born approximation may not be strictly
applicable [22]. Still, the idea is a sound one that deserves
further exploration.

A complete

theoretical description of molecule-
molecule scattering is complicated by the complexity of
the short-range interaction between molecules. Indeed,
for open shell molecules the potential energy surface is
diﬃcult to compute by ab intio methods, and remains
inadequately known. It is therefore worthwhile to seek
situations in which the inﬂuence of short-range physics
is minimal. It appears that for weak- ﬁeld seeking states
the inﬂuence of the short-range potential is weak, owing
to avoided crossings in the long-range interaction [16].
For collisions of identical fermionic molecules, the inﬂu-
ence of short-range physics may be even smaller, since
only partial waves with l ≥ 1 are present, and there is
centrifugal repulsion in all scattering channels.

A main aim of the present paper is thus to explore
the suppression of inelastic collisions in fermionic Π-state
molecules, using the OD radical as an example. This is
an illustrative choice of molecule, since we have stud-
ied its bosonic counterpart, OH, extensively in the past
[16, 23, 24]. It is also a species at the center of current
experimental interest [3, 25]. To this end we employ full
close-coupling calculations to a model of the OD-OD in-
teraction that includes only the dipolar part. We ﬁnd, as
we must, that the fermionic threshold laws ultimately fa-
vor elastic over inelastic scattering at low temperatures.
For OD, however, we ﬁnd that the energy scales for this
to happen remain quite low, on the order of microKelvins
or below, so that the usefulness of this result to evapora-
tive cooling remain questionable.

On the bright side, the suppression of inelastic colli-
sions does mean that a gas that is already cold will be sta-
ble under collisions, even in an electrostatic trap. This is
a similar conclusion to one we have drawn in the past for
magnetostatic trapping of spin-polarized paramagnetic
(nonpolar) species [26, 27]. This is useful for cold colli-
sions studies, since it is believed that collisions of weak-
electric-ﬁeld seekers are dominated by, and can be under-
stood in terms of, purely long-range dipolar forces [23].
In particular, such collisions are predicted for bosons to

have long-range resonant states, termed ﬁeld-linked res-
onances, that may be useful in understanding cold colli-
sions. A second goal of this paper is to verify that the
fermionic OD molecules also possess these resonances.

.

For energies E considerably less than Eb, scattering only
occurs from outside the barrier (barring resonances [9]),
thus setting an energy scale for the utility of the Born
approximation. To make an estimate of this energy scale,
consider the strong-ﬁeld limit, where polarized molecules
have C3 ∼ d2, the square of the dipole moment. For OD,
this sets the relevant p-wave centrifugal barrier height at
∼ 10 nK. At higher energies, the incoming wave spills
over the barrier, samples smaller-R interactions, and is
no longer well-described as a plane wave.

Assuming that the Born approximation holds, we pro-
ceed as follows. The partial scattering cross section for
a collision process entering on channel i and exiting on
channel f is given in terms of the transition matrix T by

σif =

|hi|T |f i|2,

where the channel indices i and f include partial wave
contributions li and lf , which need not be the same. In
the ﬁrst Born approximation, the T matrix elements are
given by the matrix elements of the potential (Chap. 7
of Ref. [42], where we have re-inserted the dimensionful
factors)

Here C3(lilf ) represents the appropriate oﬀ-diagonal cou-
pling matrix element, which, again, depends on ﬁeld.

For elastic scattering, where the initial and ﬁnal wave
numbers are equal, kf = ki, we can rewrite Eqn. (5) in
terms of the dimensionless variable x = kiR,

The integral in Eqn. (6) converges whenever li + lf > 0,
and is moreover independent of ki. Therefore, for any
elastic scattering process by dipolar forces that changes
l by at most 2 units, T ∼ ki at low energies, and by
Eqn. (4), the associated cross section is independent of
collision energy. In particular, the elastic scattering cross
section of identical fermions does not vanish, if they in-
teract via dipolar forces.

For completeness, we give the value of the inte-
gral. This is found by substituting ordinary Bessel
functions for the spherical Bessel functions, jn(x) =

II. THRESHOLD LAWS IN THE BORN
APPROXIMATION

Threshold laws for various power-law long-range po-
tentials have been written about extensively in the past
[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. In
this section we summarize the main results relevant to
the energy dependence of cross sections, using the ﬁrst
Born approximation to make the math transparent. Sim-
ilar arguments are presented in Refs. [9, 21].

A ﬁrst point to be considered is why the Born approxi-
mation should be of any use at all, since it is ordinarily as-
sociated with collisions of “fast” particles. Strictly speak-
ing, however, the Born approximation is valid when the
potential responsible for scattering is suitably “weak,”
meaning that the true scattering wave function is well-
approximated by the unperturbed wave function. For
dipolar scattering, the argument is as follows. Consider
elastic scattering in a single-channel whose long-range
potential varies as 1/Rs. Then, in partial wave l, the
elastic scattering phase shift will vary with wave number
k as [40]

δl ∼ αk2l+1 + βk(s−1),

(1)

where α and β are constants depending on details of the
potential.

Thus for a dipolar potential with s = 3, the second
term in Eqn. (1) is the dominant contribution to the
phase shift for any partial wave l ≥ 1, yielding δl ∼ k.
(Moreover, the l = 0 contribution to a realistic dipole-
dipole interaction rigorously vanishes by symmetry.) It
can be shown (for example, using the JWKB approxima-
tion [40]) that the second contribution in Eqn. (1) arises
from purely long-range physics, i.e., for intermolecular
separations outside the centrifugal barrier imposed by the
partial wave. As the collision energy approaches thresh-
old, this distance gets ever larger, and the inﬂuence of
the 1/R3 perturbing potential gets ever weaker. Thus,
near threshold, the wave function is well-approximated
by unperturbed spherical Bessel functions in each partial
wave, and the Born approximation can be used.

We adopt this view in the multichannel case. Because
the dipole-dipole interaction is anisotropic, diﬀerent par-
tial waves are coupled together. Nevertheless, the diag-
onal pieces of the Hamiltonian matrix have the general
form

the threshold limit.

III. COLLISION CROSS SECTIONS FOR OD

The OD radical diﬀers from OH in two signiﬁcant ways,
for our present purposes: ﬁrst, its lambda-doubling con-
stant is somewhat smaller [44] . Second, its hyperﬁne
structure depends on the nuclear spin of deuterium be-
ing 1 instead of 1/2 for hydrogen, meaning that total spin
states f = 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 are possible in the 2Π3/2
electronic ground state of OD (as in our OH work, we
consider exclusively in the electronic ground state, and
neglect excited vibrational and rotational levels). Figure
1 presents the Stark eﬀect for OD, which can be com-
pared to the similar ﬁgure for OH, Fig. (1) of Ref.[16].
Note that, due to the smaller lambda-doublet in OD, this
radical enters the linear Stark regime at applied electric
ﬁelds of ∼ 200 V/cm, as opposed to ∼ 1000 V/cm in OH.

We consider collisions of the highest-energy weak-
ﬁeld seeking state in Fig.1, with quantum numbers
|f, mf , parityi = |5/2, 5/2, f i. The details of our scatter-
ing theory have been presented elsewhere, for OH [16].
The main diﬀerence in handling OD is to incorporate
Fermi exchange symmetry, which amounts to changing
plus signs to minus signs in Eqn. (17) of Ref. [16]. Oth-
erwise, we treat the scattering in the same way, by includ-
ing only the Stark and dipole-dipole interactions, along
with the hyperﬁne structure.

cross sections versus collision energy at diﬀerent electric
ﬁelds. Three diﬀerent applied electric ﬁelds are indicated
by color coding: E = 0 (black), E = 100 V/cm (red),
and E = 1000 V/cm (blue). In each case, the solid line

denotes elastic scattering, while the dashed line repre-
sents total inelastic scattering to channels where one or
both molecules loses internal energy. In zero ﬁeld, the
molecules are completely unpolarized, and the dipole-
dipole interaction vanishes. Thus the cross sections obey
the familiar Wigner threshold laws for short-ranged in-
teractions between fermions:
the elastic cross section
σel ∝ E2, whereas the (exothermic) inelastic cross section
σinel ∝ E1/2 [40]. Thus in zero ﬁeld elastic scattering is
actually less likely than inelastic scattering at lower en-
ergies (below about 10µK in this example). Above this
energy elastic scattering appears somewhat more favor-
able than inelastic scattering, at least until several mK,
where both cross sections start to hit the unitarity limit.
Turning on the electric ﬁeld partially polarizes the
molecules, so that the dipole-dipole interaction is “acti-
vated.” Then the dipole-dipole threshold laws take eﬀect:
σel ∝ const., whereas we still have σinel ∝ E1/2. Fig.2
illustrates where this threshold behavior kicks in for dif-
ferent electric ﬁeld values. Notice that the higher the
electric ﬁeld, the lower is the energy where the thresh-
old behavior is attained. This is because the eﬀective
C3 coeﬃcient that determines the barrier height Eb is
an increasing function of electric ﬁeld, at least until it
saturates [16].

On the other hand, a Fermi gas of molecules that is
already cold will enjoy the beneﬁts of Wigner-law sup-
pression of inelastic collisions. Suppose a quantum de-
generate gas of OD could be produced at nK tempera-
tures, as is the case for current experiments in 40K and
6Li. Then Fig. 2 suggests that a small bias ﬁeld of ∼ 100
V/cm reduces inelastic cross sections to an acceptable
level of ∼ 2 × 10−14 cm2, corresponding to a rate con-

stant ∼ 10−16 cm3/sec.

To emphasize the diﬀerence between bosons and
fermions, we reproduce the E = 100 V/cm cross sec-
tions in Fig. 3 (red) along with the corresponding cross
sections for OH in the same ﬁeld (black). It is clear that
in both cases elastic scattering (solid lines) is quite simi-
lar, whereas the behavior of inelastic scattering is utterly
diﬀerent at low energies for the two species. Equally im-
portantly, at collision energies above about 1 mK, all the
cross sections have the same general behavior. This is a
manifestation of the strength of the dipolar interactions,
and the fact that in this energy range all processes are
essentially unitarity-limited.

IV. ON THE QUESTION OF FIELD-LINKED
RESONANCES

Finally, we comment on the occurrence of ﬁeld-linked
(FL) resonance states in this system. Fig. 4a shows the
elastic and inelastic cross sections versus electric ﬁeld, at
a ﬁxed collision energy of 1 µK. This ﬁgure exhibits the
characteristic peaks indicative of ﬁeld-linked resonances;
compare Fig.(2) of Ref.
[16]. To converge these results
at higher ﬁeld demands an increasing number of par-
tial waves. Fig. 4b illustrates the convergence of the
resonant scattering cross section for various numbers of
partial waves included. For partial waves L = 1, 3, 5, 7,
the cross section is well-converged up to several hundred
V/cm. This is suﬃcient to compute the ﬁrst two reso-
nance states, which are the only well-resolved ones any-
way.

[24], the FL resonances live in adiabatic potential energy
surfaces generated by avoided crossings in the long-range
dipole-dipole interaction. The surfaces have a somewhat
diﬀerent character for fermions than for bosons, however.
Fig. 5 shows a set of adiabatic curves for a single partial
wave L = 1; this is the analogue of Fig. (1) in Ref. [23].
For identical bosons, the long-range attractive part of
the relevant curve is predominantly s-wave in character,
hence has a 1/R4 behavior in an electric ﬁeld. This re-
ﬂects the fact that the direct dipolar interaction vanishes

for s-waves, and makes an eﬀect only at second order
[16]. For fermions in identical spin states, however, the

attractive part involves the p-wave interaction, where the
dipole is already nonzero, so that the long-range inter-
action scales as 1/R3. The net eﬀect is that the inner
turning point of the s-wave FL states approaches smaller
R as the ﬁeld is increased for bosons, but that this inner
turning point is relatively ﬁxed for fermions. (The outer
turning point is set by the energy of the resonant state
relative to the threshold, and is thus arbitrarily large.)

These resonant states, if suﬃciently stable, may form
a novel kind of pair of fermions, which may ultimately
lead to an exotic Fermi superﬂuid state. Unfortunately,
as seen in Fig. 4, these resonances are quite readily sus-
ceptible to predissociation, indicated by the large inelas-
tic cross sections near resonance. In this they resemble
their bosonic counterparts. However, stabilization of cold
dipolar gases using magnetic ﬁelds has been recently dis-
cussed [45]. It is yet conceivable that these resonances
could be tamed long enough to put them to use.

In summary, we have computed scattering cross sec-
tions for cold collisions of the fermionic free radical OD,
as functions of both collision energy and electric ﬁeld.
We ﬁnd that, similar to the case of bosonic OH, these
molecules are unlikely to be stable against collisions in
traps warmer than about 10 µK. Unlike OH, however,
they will be collisionally stable at lower temperatures,
owing to the unique Wigner threshold laws for fermionic
polar particles. in such a gas.

Abstract
We consider long-range interactions between two alkali-metal atoms in their respective ground
states. We extend the previous relativistic many-body calculations of C6 dispersion coeﬃcients
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 3589 (1999)] to higher-multipole coeﬃcients C8 and C10. A special attention
is paid to usually omitted contribution of core-excited states. We calculate this contribution within
relativistic random-phase approximation and demonstrate that for heavy atoms core excitations
contribute as much as 10% to the dispersion coeﬃcients. We tabulate results for both homonuclear
and heteronuclear dimers and estimate theoretical uncertainties. The estimated uncertainties for
C8 coeﬃcients range from 0.5% for Li2 to 4% for Cs2.

INTRODUCTION

We carry out accurate relativistic many-body atomic-structure calculations of van der
Waals interactions [1] between alkali-metal atoms in their respective ground states. These
long-range interactions may be parameterized using dispersion (van der Waals) coeﬃcients

where R is the internuclear separation. A renewed interest in high-accuracy interatomic
potentials has been stimulated by advances in studies of ultracold collisions [2]. At low
energies, collision properties are typically very sensitive to details of the potentials. Thus
accurate potentials are essential for reliable ab initio description of ultracold collision prop-
erties and, conversely, a wealth of information about the potentials may be inferred from
photoassociation and Feshbach-resonance spectroscopy with ultracold atomic samples. In
particular, only recently interpretation of experiments with ultracold atoms allowed several
groups to reduce uncertainties in the C6 coeﬃcients to a fraction of a per cent [3, 4, 5]. These
inferred coeﬃcients are in an excellent agreement with our values predicted using many-body
perturbation theory [6]. Even more reﬁned understanding of details of ultracold collisions
led very recently to constraints on higher-multipole coeﬃcient C8 for Rb [7, 8] and Cs [9].
This latest progress and discrepancies between previous determinations [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
of C8 and C10 coeﬃcients motivate us to calculate these coeﬃcients using accurate relativis-
tic many-body techniques of atomic structure. In particular, we demonstrate that usually
omitted contribution of core-excited states increases Cn for heavy atoms by as much as 10%.
The main result of the paper — compilation of van der Waals coeﬃcients C8 and C10 for
homonuclear and heteronuclear Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs dimers is presented in Tables VI–
IX. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present the formalism.
Numerical evaluation is discussed in Section III. A detailed analysis of underlying multipole
dynamic and static polarizabilities is presented in Section IV. Finally, in Section V we
compile dispersion coeﬃcients and estimate theoretical uncertainties. Atomic units (|e| =
me = ¯h ≡ 1) are used throughout the paper.

Previously many-body calculations of dispersion coeﬃcients C6 were carried out in
Refs. [6, 17], and here we focus on dispersion coeﬃcients C8 and C10. As follows from
an examination of Eq. (3), we need to compute dipole α1, quadrupole α2, and octupole α3
dynamic polarizabilities. In this work we employ dynamic dipole polarizabilities calculated
previously in Ref. [6] and determine higher-multipole polarizabilities α2 and α3.

Following [6] we separate all intermediate states in the sum Eq. (4) into valence and

core-excited states

αl(iω) = αv

l (iω) + αc

l (iω) + αcv

l (iω) ,

Here αv
l (iω) is a traditional term encapsulating excitations of the valence electron. Con-
tributions of electric-multipole excitations of core electrons are denoted by αc
l (iω). Finally,
a small counter term αcv
l (iω) is related to excitations of core electrons to occupied valence
state. We include these exclusion-principle-forbidden excitations in the calculations of core
polarizabilities and thus we have to introduce the counter term (see Ref. [18] for more de-
tails). We will discuss calculations of the αv
l (iω) terms later on. Here we just
brieﬂy comment on the counter term αcv
3 (iω) term sim-
ply vanishes in independent-particle approximation since E3 selection rules would require an
excitation from f shell to valence s-state and none of the alkalis considered here (Li through
Cs) has ﬁlled f-shells. Since we employ dipole polarizabilities from Ref. [6], the counter
term, calculated in Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) approximation is included in α1(iω). Finally
we disregard this correction for quadrupole polarizabilities, it gives a negligible contribution
due to required excitation of deeply bound d electrons from the core.

High-accuracy calculations of the dipole dynamic polarizabilities were carried out ear-
lier in Ref. [6] and we employ these dipole polarizabilities in the present work.
In those
calculations a combination of several relativistic many-body techniques was employed. A
dominant contribution to αv
1 has been calculated with all-order linearized coupled-cluster
method truncated at single and double excitations. High-accuracy experimental values for
energies and electric-dipole matrix elements for principle transitions has been employed to
reﬁne the dipole polarizabilities. In the following we focus on the quadrupole and octupole
polarizabilities.

To ﬁnd the quadrupole αv

3 valence contributions we applied a relativistic
many-body method initially suggested in Refs. [19, 20] and subsequently developed in [21,
22, 23, 24].
In this method one determines wave functions from solution of the eﬀective
many-body Shr¨odinger equation

with the eﬀective Hamiltonian deﬁned as

Heﬀ(E) = HFC + Σ(E) .

(8)

Here HFC is the frozen-core Dirac-Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian and self-energy operator Σ
is the energy-dependent correction, involving core excitations. Qualitatively Σ operator
corresponds to core polarization term in model potentials employed in Refs. [13, 14].
In
the present calculation the self-energy operator recovers second order of perturbation theory
in residual Coulomb interaction and additionally accounts for certain classes of many-body
diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory.

The concept of eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ may be extended to other operators. We
introduce eﬀective (or dressed) electric-multipole operators T l
eﬀ acting in the model space
of valence electrons. These operators were obtained within the relativistic random-phase
approximation (RRPA) [21, 25, 26]. Qualitatively, the RRPA describes a shielding of the
externally applied electric-multipole ﬁeld by the core electrons. The RRPA sequence of
diagrams was summed to all orders of the perturbation theory.

Once the ground-state wavefunctions are obtained from Eq. (7), the dynamic valence po-
larizabilities αv
l (iω) are computed with the Sternheimer [27] or Dalgarno-Lewis [28] method
implemented in the DHF+Σ+RRPA framework. (In the following we denote Σ+RRPA cor-
rections as the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) corrections.) Given ground-state
wave-function Ψ0 and energy E0, we ﬁnd an intermediate-state wave function Ψf from an
inhomogeneous equation

where subscript v emphasized that only excitations of the valence electron to higher virtual

Eq. (9). As to additional contribution αc
l of core-excited states, we employ the relativistic
random-phase approximation method described in Refs. [25, 26].

III. DETAILS OF NUMERICAL CALCULATION

At the ﬁrst stage of calculations we determined core orbitals and valence orbitals for
several low-lying states from the frozen-core Dirac-Hartree-Fock equations [29]. The virtual
orbitals were determined with the help of a recurrent procedure [30]. One-electron basis sets
of the following sizes were used on the stage DHF+Σ calculations:

Li :

1 − 17s, 2 − 17p, 3 − 16d, 4 − 16f, 5 − 10g;

Using these basis sets we solved the multi-particle Shr¨odinger equation (7) and found
the wave functions of low-lying states. As discussed in [31] and demonstrated in [30, 32] a
proper approximation for the eﬀective Hamiltonian can substantially improve an agreement
between calculated and experimental spectra of multielectron atom. One can introduce an
energy shift δ and replace Σ(E) → Σ(E − δ) in the eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (8). We have
determined δ from a ﬁt of theoretical energy levels to experimental spectrum. Using only one
ﬁtting parameter δ we reproduced the experimental energies for 12 low-lying states for Li
and for 10 low-lying states for Na and K with accuracy 0.1–0.2%. To reproduce the low-lying
energy levels with the same 0.1-0.2% accuracy for heavier Rb and Cs we used three ﬁtting
parameters (diﬀerent shifts δ for diﬀerent partial waves). An illustrative comparison for the
heaviest atom Cs (55 electrons) is presented in Table I. It is worth noting that an empirical
introduction of shifts δ mimics higher-order many-body corrections in perturbation theory.
We will estimate theoretical uncertainty based on sensitivity of our results to variation in
these shifts.

IV. QUADRUPOLE AND OCTUPOLE POLARIZABILITIES

To reiterate major steps of the formalism described in Section II, we determined ground
state wave functions from the eﬀective many-body Shr¨odinger equation (7), calculated
dressed electric multipole operators Teﬀ, solved inhomogeneous equation (9) and computed
valence parts αv

Calculation of dynamic polarizabilities with ω = 0 gives us the static polarizabilities. We
provide these data in Tables II and III and compare them with other results. To estimate
uncertainties we present in the Tables results of pure DHF calculations and compare them
with DHF+MBPT ones. The uncertainties of calculations are associated with higher orders

of the MBPT which are taken into account only partially. The heavier the atom, the larger
MBPT contribution is and we expect theoretical accuracy to become worse. For instance,
the MBPT correction to the static quadrupole polarizability αv
2 for Li is only 4%, while for
Cs it attains 38%. For static octupole polarizabilities αv
3 the MBPT corrections are larger
and range from 5% for Li to 48% for Cs.

Let us turn to estimates of theoretical uncertainty of quadrupole polarizabilities. Es-
sentially it is based on sensitivity of our results to semiemprically introduced shifts δ. As
mentioned in Section III an introduction of these shifts mimics omitted higher-orders of per-
turbation theory. We estimate the theoretical error bar as a half of the diﬀerence between
ab initio (δ = 0) value and result with semiempirically chosen δ. Further an overwhelm-
ing contribution to static 2l-pole polarizabilities Eq.(4) comes from the lowest-lying valence
state of proper angular symmetry. Since we recover experimental energies almost exactly
(see Table I), the theoretical uncertainty is determined by an accuracy of calculation for
electric-multipole operators of principal transitions. We write

,

where ns denotes the ground state and n′d stands for lowest-lying valence d-states. For
example, following this procedure we obtain an error bar of 0.3% for Li. Our result of
1424(4) for Li is in excellent agreement with the value 1423.266(5) from benchmark high-
accuracy variational non-relativistic calculations by Yan et al. [34]. We estimate theoretical
uncertainties for octupole polarizabilities to be at 10% level for heavy atoms. Our results
for static polarizabilities are listed in Tables II and III. In these Tables we also compare our
results with the predictions by other authors. We ﬁnd that for light atoms there is a good
agreement between diﬀerent results except the values obtained by Maeder and Kutzelnigg
[10] are consistently smaller. As the number of atomic electrons increases, the correlation
eﬀects become more pronounced and discrepancies between results from diﬀerent groups
grow larger. Marinescu et al. [13] used a model potential with ﬁve adjustment parameters
obtained by ﬁtting to experimental energy levels. Core-polarization was included in the

pseudo-potential and they also included eﬀects of shielding (or ﬁeld dressing) in the multipole
operators. Patil and Tang [14] also used eﬀective potential in their calculations to obtain
the wave functions of excited states, but they used one-parametric potential and did not
shielding in the multipole operators. Generally, our results are in a good agreement with
all results except for values by Maeder and Kutzelnigg [10]. One of possible reasons for this
discrepancy is that these authors used very small number of basis functions (e.g. only 5 basis
orbitals for p, d, and f partial waves) while α2 and α3 polarizabilities are very sensitive to
details of construction and saturation of basis sets.

Also shown in Tables II and III are the corrections αc

l due to core-excited states. These
quantities are essentially polarizabilities of singly-charged ions of alkali-metal atoms. Only
disregarding distortion of the core by the valence electrons, one may identify corrections
αc
l as core polarizabilities. For static quadrupole polarizabilities their relative contribution
to the total polarizabilities ranges from 0.01% for Li to 0.8% for Cs. The core corrections
to static octupole polarizabilities are even smaller (just 0.25% for Cs). Relative smallness
of αc
l terms for static polarizabilities may lead one to a wrong assumption that the core
excitations may be disregarded in calculations of van der Waals coeﬃcients Cn. In fact the
expression (3) for Cn contains integration over an inﬁnite range of frequencies ω. While the
region around ω = 0 does provide the dominant contribution to Cn, the high-frequency tail
of the polarizability is still important. As ω → ∞ the core polarizability overpowers valence
contribution. In fact, one of the points of the paper [6] was to explicitly demonstrate that
for heavy atoms the core polarizability may contribute as much as 15% to C6 dispersion
coeﬃcient. Here using RRPA calculations of αc
l (iω) core polarizability we will arrive at a
similar conclusion for higher-multipole coeﬃcients C8 and C10.

We calculated the core polarizabilities in the framework of relativistic random-phase ap-
proximation method (RRPA). Essentially we extended approach of Johnson et al. [26] and
incorporated frequency dependence into the calculations. Compared to Ref. [26] we also em-
ployed a diﬀerent numerical technique using B-spline basis sets. With our newly developed
code we recover the previous results [26] for static dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities. We
found that unusually large basis sets of 100 B-splines were required to achieve a numerical

comparison of the computed RRPA static quadrupole and octupole core polarizabilities with
other works in Tables IV and V. Patil [37, 38] has inferred these polarizabilities analyzing
Rydberg spectra of alkalis. His results are in a uniform agreement with our ab initio values.

Calculations of dynamic polarizabilities were discussed in the previous section and here we
proceed to evaluation of the dispersion coeﬃcients.

The computed C8 and C10 coeﬃcients for homonuclear and heteronuclear species are
presented in Tables VI– IX. The dispersion coeﬃcients C6 were tabulated previously in

8

Refs. [6, 17]. This completes the ﬁrst application of relativistic many-body methods of
atomic structure to calculations of leading long-range interactions between ground-state
alkali-metal atoms.

To estimate uncertainties in our values we notice that the main value of the quadratures,
Eqs. (12)–(15) is accumulated in the low-frequency region ω ≈ 0. Therefore the error may
be expressed via uncertainties in the static multipole polarizabilities

for Li2 to 4% for Cs dimer. We anticipate uncertainty in C10 coeﬃcients to be better than
10%.

It is instructive to consider the eﬀect of core excitation contribution αc

l (iω) to dynamic po-
larizabilities and thus to Cn coeﬃcients. Such corrections are omitted in the model potential
calculations such as Ref. [13, 14]. To illuminate the relative contributions of core-excitations
we computed Cn coeﬃcients by keeping only the valence contributions to the total dynamic
polarizabilities

αl(iω) → αv

l (iω).

Such calculated dispersion coeﬃcients are marked as C v
10 in Tables VI–IX, while
values marked “ﬁnal” were obtained with an additional inclusion of core excitations. Com-
paring these values, we observe that relative contribution of αc
l (iω) term grows rapidly as
the number of atomic electrons increases. For example, examining Table VI we see that core
correction to C8 for Li is only 0.2%, while for Cs it is 10%. For C10 coeﬃcients the core
contributions for all atoms are slightly smaller. Still for Cs core excitations contribute 8%
to the C10 coeﬃcient.

8 and C v

A comparison with results by other authors is presented in Tables VI–IX. There is good
agreement for light Li and Na atoms. For heavier atoms, in particular for Cs, there is
discrepancy at the level of 10% for C8 and 20% for C10 coeﬃcients. Such tendency may be
attributed to two factors. First, correlations become enhanced for heavier atoms. Another
cause is that model-potential calculations such as Ref. [13, 14] disregard contribution of core-
excited states. This corresponds to the valence term denoted as C v
n in Tables VI–IX. As
mentioned above the core-excited states contribute at the level of 10% for Cs. If we disregard
this contribution, we see that the model-potential results are in a reasonable agreement with
our C v

n values.

Only very recently interpretation of experiments with ultracold atoms allowed several
groups to reduce uncertainties in the C6 coeﬃcients to a fraction of a per cent [3, 4, 5].
These inferred coeﬃcients are in an excellent agreement with our values predicted using
many-body perturbation theory [6]. Even more reﬁned understanding of details of ultracold
collisions led very recently to constraints on higher-multipole coeﬃcient C8 for Rb2 [7, 8]
and Cs dimer [9]. In Table VI we present a comparision with these inferred values. Our
computed value for Rb2 5.77(8) agrees well with C8 = 5.79(49) by van Kempen et al. [7] and

C8 = 5.73 by Marte et al. [8]. However, we disagree with 1%-accurate result [7] of 6.09(7)
by four standard deviations. This 1%-accurate result was obtained in Ref. [7] by setting
additional constraints on the singlet potential of Rb dimer while including higher-multipole
van der Waals coeﬃcients C11 and C12 in the ﬁt. For Cs2 the inferred value by Leo et al.
[9] is C8 = 8.4(4), it disagrees with our prediction, 10.2(4) by more than four standard
deviations. It is worth noting that while for Rb the inferred value lies above our result, for
Cs the situation is reversed and our value is larger.

To conclude, we calculated static and dynamic quadrupole and octupole polarizabilities
for ground states of Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs atoms. The calculations were carried out
using accurate relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure. With the computed
polarizabilities we evaluated C8 and C10 van der Waals coeﬃcients for homonuclear and
heteronuclear dimers and estimated theoretical uncertainties. The estimated uncertainties
for C8 coeﬃcients range from 0.5% for Li2 to 4% for Cs2. We have highlighted the role of
usually omitted core excitations in calculation of C8, and C10 coeﬃcients and found that
their contribution is important for heavy atoms K, Rb, and Cs.

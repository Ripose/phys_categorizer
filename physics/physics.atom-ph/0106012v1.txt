Three-dimensional numerical simulations of 1 GeV/Nucleon U92+ impact against
atomic hydrogen

The impact of 1 GeV/Nucleon U92+ projectiles against atomic hydrogen is studied by direct
numerical resolution of the time-dependent non-relativistic wave-equation for the atomic electron
on a three-dimensional Cartesian lattice. We employ the fully relativistic expressions to describe
the electromagnetic ﬁelds created by the incident ion. The wave-equation for the atom interacting
with the projectile is carefully derived from the time-dependent Dirac equation in order to retain
all the relevant terms.

I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic ionization by an electromagnetic wave, either incoherent or coherent, has been widely studied since the old
times of Quantum Mechanics in many diﬀerent situations. It is also obvious, but much less common in this context,
to study ionization by the electromagnetic ﬁelds generated by a fast charged projectile passing nearby. In the case of
a laser ﬁeld, or any other electromagnetic wave, the ﬁeld is a radiation ﬁeld far from the sources, in other words, it is
made of real photons [1]. However in case of a rapidly passing projectile, the ﬁeld has diﬀerent properties and it is
just made of virtual photons.

That those virtual photons can ionize the atom is completely clear, but the ionization dynamics should be quite
diﬀerent from the laser ﬁeld case. Recently, considerable interest has been devoted to this subject [2], both for single
and multiple ionization of atoms with fast ions. However, very few experiments have been reported with relativistic
incident ions. At the GSI in Darmstadt [3], experiments with relativistic incident ions have been performed. The
GSI experiment studied the single and double ionization of helium by 1 GeV/Nucleon U92+ impact. As these authors
state, the relativistic ion generates a sub-attosecond super-intense electromagnetic pulse.

Due to the geometry of the system (incident projectile and nucleus), there are no symmetries present except for a
mirror symmetry along the plane deﬁned by the projectile trajectory and the initial position of the nucleus. Therefore
three-dimensional studies are needed and this is extremely diﬃcult to be done ab initio for a two electron system.
In the present paper we present a very realistic description of the (relativistic) ion-atom interaction but just for one-
electron atoms. We compute the electron wave-function in a Cartesian three-dimensional lattice, taking into account
the relativistic dynamics of the projectile.

Calculations in three-dimensional Cartesian grids have been shown to be a very good description for the p + H
collisions [4], with non-relativistic incident protons. The agreement with experimental results is remarkably good
for the range of parameters considered. Collisions with antiprotons have been also investigated with these ab initio
simulations [5,6]. However these calculations are done in a context that is not able to describe the peculiar features
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds (electric and magnetic ﬁelds) generated by the relativistically moving projectile. To our
knowledge no previous studies have been done based on the numerical direct resolution of the wave-equation, in cases
where the incident ion is relativistic.

A remarkable side consequence has been found. We need to describe a Lorentz transformed Coulomb ﬁeld instead
of the typical radiation ﬁelds studied in photo-ionization. For the correct quantum description of such interaction, it
is necessary to include one extra term in the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. This term is missing in most of
the studies on laser photo-ionization, that start from a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation conceptually wrong.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the electromagnetic ﬁelds created by a relativistically mov-
ing ion. In our calculations, we neglect both the recoil of the hydrogen nucleus so as the change in the trajectory of the
ion: these approximations are justiﬁed in terms of classical simulations (Monte Carlo) in Sec. III. The derivation and
discussion of the time-dependent wave-equation for the atomic system is described in Sec. IV. A detailed description
of the integration algorithms and numerical techniques is also given. In Sec. V we establish the parameters of the
calculations and we present the obtained numerical results. The ﬁnal Section is devoted to conclusions.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

As our particular choice of the coordinates, to simplify the notation without loss of generality, we consider that
the heavy ion projectile is moving in the plane z = 0 in parallel direction to the x-axis. The hydrogen nucleus is
initially at the origin and the projectile trajectory is xion(t) = x0 + vt = x0 + βct, yion(t) = b and zion(t) = 0. b is the
impact parameter (minimum distance to the nucleus in the trajectory of the ion). The notation β = v/c is standard
in relativity. The projectile is so heavy (Mion = 238mN , being mN the nucleon mass) and so energetic that we can
perfectly assume that its trajectory is not aﬀected by the atom. This point is discussed in Sec. III in terms of classical
simulations.

It is not diﬃcult to show [7] that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds created by such a relativistic projectile at an

arbitrary point (x, y, z) of space are,

III. CLASSICAL SIMULATION

The velocity vector has only one component, v = (v, 0, 0). Therefore, A(r, t) = Ax (r, t) ex and Ay = Az = 0.

Although we give, in this paper, a quantum description of the dynamics of the atomic electron interacting with the
ion, it is worth to start with a classical simulation of the three-body problem studied. For the considered parameters
of the incident ion, it is almost trivial to perform classical Monte Carlo simulations for the motion of the projectile
ion, the proton and the electron. The goal of such simulations is just to introduce the right approximations for the
subsequent quantum description.

A few conclusions appear from the classical simulations for heavy projectiles (U92+) that move relativistically (1
GeV/Nucleon, or more). First, the projectile trajectory is not changed at the space scale and with the precision
that we are interested in. Second, the hydrogen nucleus is accelerated after the collision with the projectile but the
momentum transfer is negligible unless we consider impact parameters smaller than 0.1 a.u. We are not interested in
head-on collisions, that could be relevant for nuclear physics.

In Fig. 1 we represent the motion of the hydrogen nucleus for diﬀerent values of the impact parameter (b). The
horizontal axis shows the motion in the longitudinal direction (x coordinate), and the vertical axis shows the motion
in the transversal direction (y coordinate), where the impact parameter has been added for better observing all the
curves. Both scales are in atomic units. The trajectories has been plotted since the incident projectile is placed at
x(t) = −10 a.u. (marked with big circles) until it reaches x(t) = 10 a.u.

A result is clear: for the study of the ionization up to the level of accuracy we are interested in, it is fairly exact to
consider that the projectile ion follows its trajectory unaltered. It is also reasonable, due to the short interaction time,
to consider that the hydrogen nucleus remains unaltered at its initial position. Therefore only the electron motion
needs to be described in detail. On the other side, the classical simulations indicate that the electron’s motion is
essentially non-relativistic, except for extremely small impact parameters.

IV. TIME-DEPENDENT WAVE-EQUATION

Because the electron is interacting with such time and space dependent scalar and vector potentials, it is worth
to carefully describe the structure of the wave-equation. It is well known that the Dirac equation for an electron
interacting with an arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld E(r, t) and B(r, t) described with the scalar potential, η (r, t), and
the vector potential, A (r, t), can be written as a second-oder diﬀerential equation [8]

(5)

where ΦD is the standard Dirac four-spinor, and σ′ and α are 4 × 4 matrices. The space and time dependence on
the ﬁelds, potentials and wave-function has been removed for simplicity in the expressions. To describe the Coulomb
potential of the hydrogen atom we have also included the eV term.

To move to the non-relativistic domain we start by neglecting the −ie~c α · E ΦD term, as it mixes particle and
antiparticle states. We also neglect the coupling between spin and magnetic ﬁeld, σ′ ·B, because the degree of freedom
of spin is not expected to play an important role in the dynamics of the electron, in the cases that we are considering.
Now we can just consider a one-component wave-function Φ

so that we have eliminated the fast oscillation due to the mass term. The next step towards the non-relativistic
wave-equation consists of neglecting the ∂2Ψ/∂2t term, because the fast oscillations due to the mass term have
been explicitly accounted for. Moreover it is consistent with the non-relativistic limit we are looking for to assume,
m c2 >> e(η + V ). Thus the wave-equation is simpliﬁed to,

The ie~∂η/∂t term should not be eliminated because even when the modulus is very small compared with the electron’s

It is worth to write this wave-equation in the form of a Hamiltonian system. This Hamiltonian has an extra term
i∂η/∂t, that needs to be included in the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. This term is, however, fundamental for
the validity of this non-relativistic equation for any scalar and vector potentials with arbitrary space-time dependences.

Observe that this equation is diﬀerent from the standard time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, that considers
2
the term (cp + eA)
it includes the divergence of the vector potential but it does not include the very important
i∂η/∂t term. Such equation is not general and can not be safely employed to describe the interaction with arbitrary
electromagnetic ﬁelds. Only transversal electromagnetic ﬁelds can be accurately described. We have introduced this
derivation prior to start computing the dynamics of the electron in order to clarify this point, that could become a
source of error in the description of the system.

One ﬁnal remark on the above equation. The ﬁelds that we describe with A and η, Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), are invariant
under Lorentz transformations. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is invariant under Galilean transformations
due to its non-relativistic nature. However, Eq. (14) shows neither one nor the other kind of invariance. This formal
inconsistency in our model is not important if the dynamics of the electron is non-relativistic (like in the cases that we
are considering), and thus Lorentz transformations reduces to Galilean transformations (in the low velocity regime).

they already verify the Lorentz condition because they come from the Lorentz transform of a Coulomb potential.

We numerically solve Eq. (15) on a three-dimensional Cartesian lattice with a uniform grid spacing ∆x = ∆y =
∆z = 0.3 a.u. The lattice is taken in such a way that avoids the singularity in the origin by considering grid points
at half integer times the grid spacing.

Our numerical technique is based on a symmetric splitting of the time-evolution operator so that the wave-function

at a given time t + ∆t is calculated from the wave-function in the previous time step t:

We have deﬁned the hamiltonian operators as follows:

The exponentials are thus expressed in the Cayley unitary form [9], that preserves the norm of the wave-function,
and a Crank-Nicholson scheme is employed to evaluate the space derivatives. Similar methods have been successfully
employed to integrate the non dipole Schr¨odinger equation for the interaction of atoms with very intense laser ﬁelds
[10].

The initial state for our calculations (the ground state φ1s(r) of atomic hydrogen) is computed in a 100 × 100 × 100

lattice with the imaginary time propagation method. The computed energy for this state is EB = −0.490 a.u.

impact parameter (b):

280 × 280 × 280 for b ≥ 10 a.u.

Absorbers (a mask function) were employed at the integration boundaries in order to avoid reﬂections of the ionized
population. The mask function has the form sin1/8 and it is applied over 40 points along the edge of the grid. However,
the interaction time is short enough to avoid a very large amount of population reaching the boundaries (absorbed
population is always smaller that 1 percent).

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In our calculations, the hydrogen nucleus is placed at the origin of the Cartesian coordinates. For the selected
energy of the incident ion (1 GeV/Nucleon) the relativistic parameters are β = 0.3696 and γ = 1.076. The U92+
nucleus is initially at x(0) = x0 = −200 a.u., y(0) = b and z(0) = 0 a.u. That choice of the initial value of x(0) is
a good compromise between accuracy -due to the long range of the Coulomb potential- and a reasonable computer
time. The electronic wave-function is propagated in time until the ion reaches x(τ ) = 600 a.u. (τ = 15.8 a.u. is the
ﬁnal time). 2667 time iterations are employed, so that the ion covers a distance equal to the grid spacing (0.3 a.u.)
each time step (∆t = ∆x/v = 0.00592 a.u.). In order to avoid problems with the singularity of the Coulomb potential
of the ion, the projectile moves equidistantly to the nearest points of the lattice.

We investigate the eﬀect of the impact parameter in the dynamics of the atomic electron by varying b (non-
uniformly) from 1 a.u. to 150 a.u. We avoid smaller impact parameters because they contribute negligibly to electron
ionization cross sections and they turn out to be relevant for ion-proton scattering (a physical situation out of the
scope of the present paper).

We evaluate, during the time propagation, the projection of the wave function over the ground state φ1s(r) to
compute the total excitation probability (probability of ﬁnding population both in free states as in bound excited
states), for each value of the impact parameter:

V is the volume of the integration box.

In Fig. 2 it is represented the computed values of Pexc for diﬀerent impact parameters b, at the ﬁnal time t = τ .
In fact, due to the fast motion of the ion, very few iterations after the ion has passed at the minimum distance to the
nucleus (b), the excitation probability remains approximately unchanged. From these values it is possible to estimate
the total excitation cross section at the ﬁnal time, deﬁned as

Pexc(b, t) = 1 −

We interpolate the excitation probability at the intermediate points with cubic-spline standard methods. The obtained
value is σexc(τ ) ≃ 8.4 × 10−15 cm2.

To gain insight into the dynamics of the electrons, we compute the population that remains, at any time of the
interaction, at a distance R to the nucleus greater than 15 a.u.
[PR>20(t)], that
can be regarded as ionized electrons. At the ﬁnal time τ , both values of the population have been plotted in Fig. 3
in terms of the impact parameter b. Dashed lines and diamonds corresponds to PR>15(τ ) while solid lines and circles
correspond to PR>20(τ ). Both curves sharply decreases from b = 1 to b = 5 a.u., so that very few electrons can be
measured for larger impact parameters.

[PR>15(t)] or greater than 20 a.u.

In Fig. 4 we plot the time evolution of the population PR>15(t), for diﬀerent values of the impact parameter. The
horizontal axis contain the interaction time in atomic units and the vertical axis the population PR>15(t). We may
approximately know the velocity distribution of the ejected electrons, by simply assuming that ionization process
occurs at the time when the ion is placed at the minimum distance to the nucleus [xion(ti) = 0, yion(ti) = b and
zion(ti) = 0]. In fact this is a good approximation due to the very high velocity of the projectile. The time ti at
which the ion is placed at this minimum distance is marked with a vertical arrow. Vertical dashed lines indicate the
minimum necessary velocity of the ejected electrons, vm, to reach the distance R = 15: vm(t) ≃ (t − ti)/15 a.u. (for
t > ti). Observe that no electrons are ejected with velocities greater that 5 a.u. (v = 0.037c). Thus, to employ the
non-relativistic wave-equation is justiﬁed to describe the electron dynamics.

5

At the ﬁnal time τ , we have also computed the angular distribution of the electrons. To do so we consider electrons
placed between two spheres, i.e. electrons placed at a distance R from the nucleus such that R1 < R < R2 with R1 = 15
a.u. and R2 = 30a.u. These values of the radii mean that we are considering electrons ejected with approximated
velocities in the range 1.3 < vm < 2.6 a.u.
In Fig. 5 this angular distribution has been plotted for the impact
parameter b = 1 a.u. (plots at the top) and b = 3 a.u. (plots at the bottom). The angular distribution per volume
unit is deﬁned by:

where we have deﬁned:

p(θ, φ) =

|Ψ(r, θ, φ)|2r2 sin θdrdθdφ

Ω(R1 < R < R2, θ, φ) =

r2 sin θdrdθdφ .

(21)

(22)

The spherical coordinates are deﬁned in the standard form, x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ and z = r cos θ. The
angular step is ∆θ = ∆φ = π/18 rad. Plots on the left are contour plots with dark regions representing the maximum
population. Contour lines are in linear scale. Plots on the right are surface plots, also in linear scale.

Observe the clear diﬀerence between both pairs of plots. For the impact parameter b = 1 a.u., the peak of the
ejected electrons is placed along the positive part of the y-axis (θ = π/2 and φ = π/2) but also appears a second
peak along the negative part of the y-axis (θ = π/2 and φ = 3π/4). This second peak is a consequence of the fact
that the ion crosses well over the electronic cloud. The minimum density of electrons are found along the x-axis, the
longitudinal direction, (θ = π/2, φ = 0 and θ = π/2, φ = π). However for the impact parameter b = 3 a.u. only the
ﬁrst peak can be observed: in this case the ion does not cross over the electronic cloud.

Finally, in Fig. 6 we plot the probability density at diﬀerent times of the interaction with the ion, at the planes
z = 0 (plots at the top), y = 0 (plots in the middle) and x = 0 (plots at the bottom). The impact parameter is
b = 3 a.u. The column on the left corresponds to the time at which the ion is placed at the minimum distance to
the nucleus [xion(t) = 0]. The column in the middle is for xion(t) = 400 a.u. (t = 11.8 a.u.) and the column on the
right for xion(t) = 600 a.u. (t = τ = 15.8 a.u.). The contour lines are in logarithmic scale. In the frame z = 0 in the
ﬁrst column, the eﬀect of the incident ion can be observed as a distortion of the wave-packet. Once the projectile has
passed, ionized population moves mainly along the transverse direction (y axis). The slight trembling in the lower
contour lines that can be appreciated in a few frames, is due to spatial discretization eﬀects and the non continuous
evaluation of the trajectory of the ion.

The same arrangement of the plots is used in Fig. 7, but now for the impact parameter b = 10 a.u. The distortion
of the wave packet is similar to that shown in Fig. 6. However, ejected electrons are even slower and at the ﬁnal time
the spreading of the wave-function is not so marked.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented very realistic three-dimensional numerical simulations to describe the collision of relativistic
heavy ions against hydrogenic atoms. Our simulations are based on the ab initio integration of the time-dependent
wave-equation derived from the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation, that is valid for arbitrary electrogmanetic
potentials. This equation diﬀers from the standard time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in a term that includes
the time derivative of the scalar potential: neglecting this term leads to a conceptually wrong formulation. The
recoil of the ion and the motion of the atomic nucleus have been neglected in our simulations. We have employed a
three-dimensional Cartesian grid to integrate the wave-equation. As results, we should point out that the probability
of excitation of the atom sharply increases for impact parameters b < 15 a.u. However, the ejection of fast electrons
is only relevant for even smaller values of the impact parameter (b < 5 a.u.). The space distribution of such electrons
is centered along the transversal direction. It is composed of one maximum (in the positive direction of the y axis)
even for short impact parameters (b > 3 a.u.). Only in collisions where the ion crosses over the electronic cloud a
more complex structure appears.

FIG. 6. Probability density at diﬀerent times of the interaction with the ion, at the planes z = 0 (plots at the top), y = 0
(plots in the middle) and x = 0 (plots at the bottom). The impact parameter is b = 3 a.u. The column on the left corresponds
to the time at which the ion is placed at the minimum distance to the nucleus [xion(t) = 0]. The column in the middle is for
xion(t) = 400 a.u. (t = 11.8 a.u.) and the column on the right for xion(t) = 600 a.u. (t = τ = 15.8 a.u.). The contour lines are
in logarithmic scale. Atomic units are used.

Systems involving N -identical interacting particles under quantum conﬁnement appear in many
areas of physics, including chemical, condensed matter, and atomic physics. We discuss a beyond-
mean-ﬁeld perturbation method that is applicable to weakly, intermediate and strongly-interacting
systems. Group theory is used to derive an analytic beyond-mean-ﬁeld correlated wave function at
zeroth order for a system under spherical conﬁnement. We derive the corresponding zeroth-order
analytic density proﬁle and apply it to the example of a Bose-Einstein condensate.

INTRODUCTION

During the last two decades, novel N -body quantum
systems have been created using techniques to conﬁne
and manipulate atoms, ions, and electrons. These sys-
tems, of both fundamental and technological interest, in-
clude condensed atomic Bose gases, atoms conﬁned in op-
tical lattices, quantum dots, and ultracold fermion gases.
Tuning the external ﬁelds of these environments provides
unique opportunities to study many-body eﬀects over a
range of interaction strengths.
Mean-ﬁeld treatments,

the Hartree-Fock
method in atomic physics and the Gross-Pitaevskii
method in condensed matter, do not include correlation
eﬀects and fail to describe systems with tight conﬁne-
ment or strong interaction. These systems, which have
hundreds to millions of particles, present serious chal-
lenges for existing N -body methods, many of which were
developed with small systems in mind.

such as

The methodology described below uses dimensional
perturbation theory (DPT)[1], which has been previously
applied to mostly small-N systems in the form of high-
order, largely numeric calculations.
In this letter, we
use group theoretic techniques to develop an analytic ap-
proach which fully exploits the symmetry of the zeroth-
order problem. This method avoids heavy numerical
computation, and N enters into the theory as a param-
eter. This crucial simpliﬁcation allows results for any N
to be obtained in a single calculation. This method also
directly accounts for each two-body interaction, rather
than using an average interaction. Even lowest-order re-
sults include beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀects. Thus, in contrast
to the low-density expansion methods pioneered by Lee,
Huang and Yang in the 1950s[2], this method is appropri-
ate for the study of both weakly and strongly interacting
systems and the transition between them. This general
formalism oﬀers a systematic approach to the study of
correlation in atomic and molecular, condensed-matter,
chemical, and nuclear systems.

Nearly all past work using DPT has focused on en-
In

ergies with little attention given to wave functions.

this paper we derive an analytic, correlated lowest-order
S-wave wave function for N identical particles in a spher-
ical conﬁning potential. The lowest-order wave function
yields important information such as the nature of ex-
citations and expectation values of physical observables.
This result can be systematically improved by going to
higher order.

TOOLBOX

The tools used to describe large-N correlated wave
functions are carefully chosen to maximize the use of
symmetry and minimize the dependence on numerical
computation. We handle the massive number of inter-
N 2/2 two-body interactions) by
actions for N large (
∼
bringing together three theoretical methods.

The ﬁrst, DPT[1],

is chosen because its zeroth-
order equation, which is obtained for large D, yields a
maximally-symmetric conﬁguration for N identical par-
ticles. Higher orders yield insight into fundamental mo-
tions as well as a framework for successive approxima-
tions. The second method is the F G method of Wil-
son, Decius, and Cross[3]. This seminal method has long
been used in quantum chemistry to study vibrations of
polyatomic molecules.
It directly relates the structure
of the Schr¨odinger equation to the coordinate set which
describes the normal modes of the system. The third
method, the use of group theoretic techniques[3, 4], takes
full advantage of the symmetry at zeroth-order.

Dimensional Perturbation Theory

For N -body systems in large dimensions, the DPT
wave function is localized about a symmetric structure in
which each particle is equidistant and equiangular from
every other particle. The Jacobian-weighted[5] DPT
wave function is harmonic and corresponds to oscillations
about this structure. Notwithstanding its relatively sim-
ple form, the large-dimension, zeroth-order wave function

includes beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀects.

The expansion parameter is δ = 1/D, and κ(D)
is quadratic in D with the particular form chosen to
simplify the resulting equations[7]. The quantities ¯r∞
and γ∞ deﬁne the symmetric large-dimension structure,
which depends on the nature and strength of the interpar-
ticle interaction and conﬁning potential. The matrices G
and F are constants derived from the Hamiltonian.

The F G Method

The FG method[3] is used to obtain normal-mode co-
ordinates and frequencies from the eigenvalue problem
in Eq. (1). The bth normal-mode coordinate q′
b may be
written as

[q′]b = bT ¯y′ , where F G b = λb b ,
bT G b = 1 , λb = ¯ω2
b ,

(3)

and ¯ωb is the normal-mode frequency. Equation (3) still
represents a formidable eigenvalue problem unless N is
quite small, since there are P = N (N + 1)/2 normal
coordinates and up to P distinct frequencies.

Group Theory: the SN Symmetry

The full S-wave Hamiltonian is invariant under parti-
cle interchange. This fact deﬁnes an SN symmetry un-
der which the system is invariant. As deﬁned in Eq. (2),
the large-dimension structure is a completely symmet-
ric conﬁguration so Eq. (1) is also invariant under the
group SN . This SN symmetry[4] brings about a remark-
able reduction from P possible distinct frequencies to ﬁve
actual distinct frequencies and greatly simpliﬁes the de-
termination of the normal coordinates through the use of
symmetry coordinates.[3]

1, 1] respectively[6]. The γ′

As a prelude to the above, we note that the SN invari-
ance of Eq. (1) means that the F, G and FG matrices of
Eq. (3) are invariant under SN , which implies that the
eigenvectors b and normal modes transform under irre-
ducible representations (irreps.) of SN . Using the theory
of group characters[4], the coordinates ¯r′
i are reduced to
1)-dimensional irrep.,
one 1-dimensional and one (N
ij are
labelled [N ] and [N
reducible to one 1-dimensional, one (N
1)-dimensional,
3)/2-dimensional irrep., labelled [N ],
and one N (N
2, 2] respectively. Since the normal
[N
modes transform under irreps. of SN and are composed
of linear combinations of elements of vectors ¯r′ and γ′ ,
1)-dimensional,
there will be two 1-dimensional, two (N
3)/2-dimensional irreps.
and one entirely angular N (N
labelled by the partitions [N ], [N
2, 2]
respectively. All normal modes that transform together
under the same irrep. have the same frequency, so rather
than P distinct frequencies there are only ﬁve!

NORMAL MODES – THE PROGRAM

We determine the normal coordinates and distinct fre-

quencies in a three-step process[6]:

−

First, we deﬁne sets of primitive irreducible coordi-
nates that have the simplest possible functional form sub-
ject to the requirement that they transform under par-
ticular non-orthogonal irreps. of SN . We deﬁne two sets
of linear combinations of elements of the ¯r′ vector which
transform under non-orthogonal [N ] and [N
1, 1] irreps.
of SN . We then derive two sets of linear combinations of
elements of the γ′ vector which transform under exactly
these same two irreps. of SN . Finally we deﬁne a set
of linear combinations of elements of γ′ which transform
2, 2] irrep. of SN .
under a particular non-orthogonal [N
Second, we use linear combinations within each set of
primitive irreducible coordinates to determine symmetry
coordinates that are deﬁned to transform under orthog-
onal irreps. of SN . Care is taken to ensure that this
transformation to the symmetry coordinates preserves
the identity of equivalent representations in the ¯r′ and
γ′ sectors. We choose one of the symmetry coordinates
to be a single primitive irreducible coordinate, the sim-
plest functional form possible that transforms irreducibly
under SN . The next symmetry coordinate is chosen to be
composed of two primitive irreducible coordinates, and so
on. Thus the complexity of the symmetry coordinates is
minimized, building up slowly as symmetry coordinates
are added.

Third, the FG matrix, which was originally expressed
in the ¯r′ and γ′ basis, is now expressed in symmetry co-
ordinates. This results in a stunning simpliﬁcation. The

An Example: the BEC Density Proﬁle

We perform a proof-of-concept test on our zeroth-order
density proﬁle by considering a T = 0K BEC in an
isotropic, harmonic trap. We take the interatomic po-
tential to be a hard sphere of radius a = 0.0433aho (ten
times the natural scattering length of 87Rb) and N = 100
(a ten-fold increase in N beyond existing benchmark dif-
fusion Monte Carlo (DMC) density results[8]). At this N
and a the modiﬁed Gross-Pitaevskii method (MGP)[9] is
still valid for comparison. To implement the perturbation
theory with κ(D) = D2aho, we allow this hard-sphere
potential to soften away from D = 3 by deﬁning the in-
teratomic potential

where ¯a = D2a, and the parameters ¯V0 and ¯c0 specify the
height and width. We exploit this freedom in the shape
and position of the interatomic potential at large D to
ensure that the lowest-orders energy and wave function,
Φ0(¯y′), are as accurate as possible. The parameters ¯V0
and ¯c0 are determined by a least-squares ﬁt to benchmark
DMC energies (N = 5
100) and densities (N = 3 and
10)[8]. In Figure 1 our analytic density proﬁle compares
well to the MGP result.

This letter discusses an analytic approach to the study
of quantum-conﬁned N -body systems. Unlike mean-ﬁeld
methods, this approach directly accounts for each inter-
particle interaction, even at lowest-order, and so is appli-
cable to high-density, strongly-interacting systems. By
taking advantage of three powerful methods, DPT, the
FG method and the group theory of the SN group, we
avoid heavy numerical computation and oﬀer a system-
atic approach to correlation that is not limited to small-N
systems. While most prior work with DPT has focused
on energies, this letter derives the lowest-order, analytic,
correlated wave function for a spherically-conﬁned, N -
particle system and the corresponding analytic density
proﬁle.

We apply direct frequency-comb spectroscopy, in combination with precision cw spectroscopy, to
measure the 4s4p 3P1 → 4s5s 3S1 transition frequency in cold calcium atoms. A 657 nm ultra-
stable cw laser was used to excite atoms on the narrow (γ ∼ 400 Hz) 4s2 1S0 → 4s4p 3P1 clock
transition, and the direct output of the frequency comb was used to excite those atoms from the
4s4p 3P1 state to the 4s5s 3S1 state. The resonance of this second stage was detected by observing
a decrease in population of the ground state as a result of atoms being optically pumped to the
metastable 4s4p 3P0,2 states. The 4s4p 3P1 → 4s5s 3S1 transition frequency is measured to be
ν = 489 544 285 713(56) kHz; which is an improvement by almost four orders of magnitude over
the previously measured value. In addition, we demonstrate spectroscopy on magnetically trapped
atoms in the 4s4p 3P2 state.

By providing a clockwork to divide optical frequencies
down to countable rf frequencies, stabilized femtosecond
frequency combs have made possible absolute frequency
metrology of cw lasers used to probe atomic transitions
at unprecedented levels of accuracy [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
In
addition, direct frequency-comb spectroscopy has been
performed in a variety of systems including two-photon
and single photon transitions [6, 7, 8, 9]. Here we extend
the techniques developed using direct frequency comb
spectroscopy to the study of transitions between excited
states by performing step-wise spectroscopy in combina-
tion with a cw laser. Signiﬁcantly, we exploit the fre-
quency comb’s wavelength versatility to directly excite
transitions between excited states of cold calcium (Ca)
atoms at 612 nm and 616 nm, eliminating the need for
lasers operating at these wavelengths. By utilizing these
techniques in conjunction with cold atoms we are able to
surmount the low power limitations and have achieved
an uncertainty of 56 kHz, despite having only ≈ 75 nW
of power in the resonant mode.

The frequency comb is generated by an octave-
spanning femtosecond mode-locked laser based on
Ti:sapphire with a repetition rate of ≈ 1 GHz and is
described in detail in Ref. [10]. The frequency comb pro-
vides ≈ 105 optical modes that are related to two rf fre-
quencies by

νn = f0 + n fRep,

(1)

where n is the mode number, f0 is the carrier-envelope
oﬀset frequency and fRep is the repetition rate of the
laser. The carrier-envelope oﬀset frequency is stabilized
by use of the self-referencing method with a f -to-2f in-
terferometer [11]. The repetition rate is phase locked
to a synthesizer referenced to a hydrogen maser. The
stabilization of the comb in this manner results in the
stabilization of all of the optical frequencies of the comb
with fractional uncertainties below the 10−12 level in one

second.

The comb provides ≈ 200 nW of power per optical
mode at 612 nm. Because light in the wings of the op-
tical spectrum results from continuum generation within
the Ti:S laser crystal the resulting spatial mode is not
Gaussian [10]. Consequent diﬃculties in coupling this
light into single mode ﬁber led us to to produce 612 nm
light via broadening in highly nonlinear ﬁber that pro-
duced a comparable level of light at 612 nm but with a
clean Gaussian mode. The light was then ﬁltered using
a 612 nm bandpass interference ﬁlter with a passband of
3 nm and sent through ∼ 20 m of optical ﬁber to the Ca
atoms. Due to losses in the ﬁber coupling and in the op-
tics used to deliver the light to the atoms, approximately
70 µW of light over a 3 nm bandwidth was delivered to
the atoms. Using an optical spectrum analyzer we esti-
mate there was approximately 75 nW per optical mode
at the resonant wavelength.

An overview of the experiment is shown in Fig. 2. The
experiment utilized an apparatus built for an optical fre-
quency standard based on the 4s2 1S0 → 4s4p 3P1 M = 0
clock transition in 40Ca that is described in detail in

Ref.[12]. The atoms were laser cooled and trapped on
the 4s2 1S0 → 4s4p 1P1 transition at 423 nm (Fig. 1)
for 2.5 ms. The resulting sample consisted of ≈ 6 × 107
atoms at a temperature of 2 mK. The cold ground-state
atoms were excited on the 4s2 1S0 → 4s4p 3P1 M = 0
transition, which has a natural linewidth of 374 Hz [13],
using linearly polarized resonant light at 657 nm consist-
ing of a π pulse with a duration of 2.5 µs. This excitation
selects atoms near zero velocity. Approximately 15 %
of the atoms were excited to the 3P1 state. After a de-
lay of 40 µs the number of atoms in the ground state
was probed with a 50 µs pulse of 423 nm light resonant
with the 4s2 1S0 → 4s4p 1P1 transition, and the subse-
quent ﬂuorescence was detected with a photomultiplier
tube. The entire cooling-trapping-excitation-probe cycle
was repeated every 2.6 ms.

The repetition rate of the frequency comb was scanned
over a range of 250 Hz, corresponding to a change of 125
MHz in the optical frequency of the mode used to excite
the 3P1 →3 S1 transition. When the comb light is res-
onant with the transition, atoms are excited to the 3S1
state, from which they decay to the 3PJ states with an
approximate branching ratio of 5 : 3 : 1 for the J = 2, 1, 0
states, respectively. Consequently, roughly 2/3 of the
atoms decay to the long lived metastable 3P0 and 3P2
states. The decay to these states provides a loss mecha-
nism for the trapped atom number. While atoms in the
3P1 state can decay back to the ground state and be re-
captured in the next loading sequence, the atoms that
decay to the meatstable J = 0, 2 states are do not decay
to the ground state. In steady state, this leads to a de-
crease in the number of atoms detected with the probe
pulse. The 612 nm light from the comb was modulated
with a optical chopper wheel operating with a 50 % duty
cycle at a frequency of 10 Hz. The modulation frequency
was chosen to be slow enough so that the 612 nm light
leak mechanism would yield a suﬃcient depletion of the

respond to transitions to the M = ±1 states of the 3S1 state.

number of atoms, while still providing suﬃcient suppres-
sion of low-frequency noise. The population transfer was
then measured by looking for changes in the probe ﬂuo-
rescence via lock-in detection.

A typical signal is shown in Fig. 3. The two peaks
correspond to the MJ = ±1 components of the 4s5s 3S1
state, which are split due to the residual ﬁeld of the
magneto-optical trap. The MJ = 0 component is not
excited because of the selection rule forbidding MJ =
0 → MJ ′ = 0 transitions for states where J ′ = J. The
612 nm light is roughly linearly polarized perpendicular
to the 657 nm light. We attribute the diﬀerence in am-
plitudes of the two peaks to imperfect polarization of the
612 nm light.

The data were ﬁt to two Voigt proﬁles with the same
widths. This lineshape was empirically seen to correctly
describe the data. The actual lineshape is complicated
by broadening due to the magnetic ﬁeld gradient in the
center of the trap. The average between the center po-
sitions of the two peaks was used to extract the value of
the ﬁeld-free resonance frequency.

In order to determine the optical frequency, the optical
mode number of the frequency comb resonant with the
transition must be known. This can be accomplished by
varying the mode number, n, by a known amount ∆n
such that

δfRep
fRep

≪ ∆n
n2 ,

(2)

where δfRep
is the fractional uncertainty in the repeti-
fRep
tion rate of the resonance as determined from the ﬁt.
We identiﬁed the optical mode number by adjusting the
repetition rate of the comb so as to shift the resonant
mode number by exactly 200 modes, corresponding to a
change in the repetition rate of the laser of ≈ 2 MHz.
Data were taken at four diﬀerent optical modes spanning
200 modes. Based on the consistency of the data we were
able to unambiguously identify the mode numbers.

The extracted central frequencies of 15 data sets are
shown in Fig. 4. Each data set is the average of two
scans of the repetition rate over the resonance; one with
increasing frequency and one with decreasing frequency.
A diﬀerence between the scans taken with increasing fre-
quency and those taken with decreasing frequency was
observed. The average diﬀerence was 40(26) kHz. We
attribute this diﬀerence to slow changes in the alignment
of the microstructure ﬁber, leading to changes in the opti-
cal power as the laser was scanned over the resonance. As
the power changes during the scan, there is an eﬀective
shift in the center position of the resonances. The ampli-
tudes of the four peaks (two Zeeman states for both the
increasing and decreasing frequency scans) can be used
to determine the linear and quadratic drift in the power.
This was done for a data set exhibiting a large change
in the power during the course of the scan. The coeﬃ-
cients thus determined were used to ascertain the eﬀect
of the power changes on the measurement of the peak
centers. A shift of 100 kHz was observed as a result of
the power drift. However, the eﬀect of the drift canceled
in the average of the increasing frequency and decreasing
frequency scans at a level of 15 kHz. We therefore assign
an uncertainty of 15 kHz due to power variations in the
612 nm light in the extracted frequency.

There is also a systematic uncertainty resulting from
the frequency of the 657 nm cw light. The 657 nm light
was stabilized to a highly stable optical cavity that has a
drift rate of ≈ 5 Hz/s, corresponding to a drift of ≈ 2 kHz
over the course of the scan. This drift results in a drift of
the central velocity of the atoms excited by the 657 nm
light and therefore a drift in the Doppler eﬀect of the 612
nm transition. The result of the linear drift on the ex-
traction of the transition frequency is much less than that
due to the power ﬂuctuations described above and is fur-
ther suppressed by the combination of the spectra taken
with increasing and decreasing repetition rates. Prior to
a scan of the 612 nm light, the central frequency of 657
nm light was centered on the zero-velocity class by use of
Doppler-free spectroscopy to within ≈ 50 kHz. Because
the center frequency of the 657 nm light was recentered
before each scan, we expect random variations in this er-
ror. We increased the statistical errors determined from
the ﬁts by 50 kHz to account for this additional eﬀect.
After including this eﬀect, the spread of the data remains
larger than the uncertainties on the individual scans. We
attribute this to a possible motion of the trap during the
scan, leading to shifts in the average magnetic ﬁeld to
which the atoms are exposed. We inﬂate the errors by a
factor of 2.7 to get an appropriate chi squared and take
this scatter into account. This gives an error on the mean
of 54 kHz.

We also considered the eﬀect of ac Stark shifts due
to the trapping light. Since the transition of interest
is between two excited states, the trapping light is far
oﬀ resonance with both states. Considering the possible
states that could couple to the 4s4p 3P1 state via a 423
nm photon, we estimate the ac Stark shift of this state to

be less than 20 Hz. A 423 nm photon brings the 4s5s 3S1
state above the ionization limit, and the ac Stark shift
for the state is consequently negligible. The small optical
power per mode and the 1 GHz separation of the optical
modes make ac Stark shifts from the non-resonant comb
modes negligible. Other systematic uncertainties that
were considered are presented in Table I.

We arrive at a ﬁnal value for the transition frequency

of

ν(cid:0)3P1 →3 S1(cid:1) = 489 544 285 713(56) kHz.

(3)

This value is an improvement by almost four orders of
magnitude over the previously measured value as tabu-
lated in Ref. [14]: ν(cid:0)3P1 →3 S1(cid:1) = 489544032(450) MHz.
In addition to the measurement of the 3P1 →3 S1 tran-
sition, we were able to observe the 4s4p 3P2 → 4s5s 3S1
transition at 616 nm. This experiment was performed
without directly exciting atoms to the 4s4p 3P2 state.
Instead, the atoms were populated to the 3P2 state dur-
ing the cooling and trapping process. Atoms excited to
the 1P1 state have a ≈ 10−5 probability to decay to the
4s3d 1D2 state. These atoms decay predominantly to
the 3P states. Atoms that decay to the 3P2 state can be
magnetically trapped in the magnetic ﬁeld gradient due

to the MOT trapping coils. By exciting these atoms on
the 4s4p 3P2 → 4s5s 3S1 transition at 616 nm we were
able to create a repumping mechanism that increases the
number of atoms in the ground state, as some of the
atoms decay from the 3S1 state to the 3P1 state and then
back to the ground state. The experiment is identical to
that used for the measurement of the 3P1 →3 S1 tran-
sition frequency, except that there is no 657 nm π pulse
needed. The probe signal as the repetition rate of the
comb is scanned across the resonance is shown in Fig. 5.

observed on the 612 nm transition described above, which
gives a residual ﬁeld of 6.3(3) × 10−4 T. We estimate
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient to be 60(12) × 10−4 T/cm
in the strong direction. Using these values, and assum-
ing a Gaussian spatial and velocity distribution of atoms
over the magnetic ﬁeld region, gives an estimate for the
shift of the diﬀerent transitions. We ﬁnd the transition
frequencies shift by −13 MHz, −9 MHz, and 4 MHz
for the M = 1 → M = 0, M = 2 → M = 1, and
M = 1 → M = 1 transitions, respectively.
If equal
weights for the three transitions are assumed and the
diﬀerent broadening of the transitions is included, the
eﬀective shift of the resonance is −4 MHz. Due to uncer-
tainties in the relative excitation rates for the diﬀerent
transitions, along with uncertainties in the alignment of
polarization with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld gradients,
we assign a 9 MHz uncertainty, along with a +4 MHz
correction, to the measured frequency. Given this large
uncertainty, we arrive at a value of

FIG. 5: Fluorescence signal from the 423 nm probe as the
repetition rate of the frequency comb is scanned over the
4s4p 3P2 → 4s5s 3S1 transition. A decrease in the voltage
corresponds to an increase in the ground-state population.

Only states with M = +1 or M = +2 are magneti-
cally trapped. There are three possible transitions from
these states to the M = 0 and M = +1 Zeeman sub-
levels of the 3S1 state. Because of the broadening due
to the spatial distribution of the atoms in the magnetic-
ﬁeld gradient, we were unable to resolve these transitions.
Consequently, we are unable to determine the Zeeman
shift of the transition and cannot calibrate the spatial
distribution of the atoms within the magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient. While the atoms are distributed over a large vol-
ume within the magnetic trap, the 616 nm laser beam
intersects only a small region, about 1 mm diameter, of
the trap, which is overlapped with the MOT. In order to
estimate the magnetic ﬁeld over the region of the probe
beam, we use the measurement of the Zeeman splitting

This value is an improvement by a factor of 50 over
the current value listed in Ref. [14] of ν(3P2 →3 S1) =
486 369 853(450) MHz.

We have performed a measurement of the 4s4p 3P1 →
4s5s 3S1 transition in calcium using the direct output of
a femtosecond frequency comb. This experiment demon-
strates the versatility of direct frequency-comb spec-
troscopy by combining it with precision cw laser spec-
troscopy to achieve high-precision absolute frequency
measurements of transitions between excited states at
wavelengths that are otherwise diﬃcult to produce.

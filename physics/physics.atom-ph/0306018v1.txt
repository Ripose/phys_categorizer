In this paper we consider spin-1 Bosons, such as 23Na, trapped in an optical lattice, in the regime
of one particle per site. We argue that the ground state is expected to be the dimer phase in one,
two, or three dimensions, thus realizing a state that has so far been studied only theoretically.

PACS numbers: 03.75.-b, 03.75.Lm, 03.75.Mn

Tremendous progress has been made recently on trapping and cooling atoms. Greiner et al [1] has succeeded in
observing the Bosonic Mott-Hubbard transition. In the experiment, the Bosons involved are 87Rb atoms and the
lattice potential is provided by the standing waves of three orthogonal laser beams. For weak lattice potentials, the
system remains a superﬂuid (Bose-Einstein condensate). When the lattice potential is increased beyond a critical
strength, the tunneling rate for atoms between the diﬀerent wells becomes weak compared with the repulsion for two
atoms residing in the same well, the system enters into the Mott regime. In this case the number of atoms in each
well is essentially ﬁxed at an integer value (here, one). Phase coherence and hence superﬂuidity is lost. [2,3]

The 87Rb atoms in the experiment of Greiner et al [1] were hyperﬁne-spin-polarized. In this paper, we discuss the
interesting physics that can be realized if 23Na atoms are employed instead of 87Rb and if the atoms are not polarized.
Bose-Einstein condensation of unpolarized 23Na has already been achieved by the MIT group [4]. The 23Na atoms
have hyperﬁne spin (hereafter simply as ”spin”) 1 in their lower energy manifold, and the interaction among them
is antiferromagnetic [5,4] (in contrast to 87Rb, where it is ferromagnetic). We shall conﬁne ourselves to the Mott
regime where there is essentially one atom per cell, and discuss the arrangement of the hyperﬁne spin states (or, more
precisely, the projections) for the atoms in this lattice. We shall argue that the ground state is expected to be the
dimer phase in one, two, or three dimensions. This is in contrast with spin-1 electronic systems where the eﬀective
Hamiltonian is the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. There in one dimension, the system would be in the Haldane
phase, whereas long range Ne´el order is expected to be present in two and three dimensions. [6]

≡

Consider then a (cubic) lattice formed by three orthogonal laser beams, with eﬀective potential for the 23Na atoms of
the form V (x, y, z) = Vxsin2(kx)+ Vysin2(ky)+ Vzsin2(kz) where k
2π
λ is the wave-vector of the lasers. The strength
Vx,y,z of the sinusoidal potentials are proportional to the intensities of the laser beams and can be adjusted separately.
As in Ref [3] we assume that only one orbital state is involved for each well. The eﬀective Hamiltonian for our system
can be written in a Bose-Hubbard form [3] (generalized to Bosons with spin). The hopping matrix elements, tx,y,z
1/2
are dependent on the directions of hopping. The order of magnitude of tx is given by
¯h2k2/2m and m is the mass of the atoms. Though we are considering one particle per well, the system
where ER ≡
can exist in excited states where the wells are multiplely occupied. We shall conﬁne ourselves to the regime where
these energies are large compared with the hopping energies
. Thus we need only consider those excited states
with at most two particles per well. The extra energy is described by the Hubbard repulsion US which depends on
(ERVxVyVz)1/4kaS where aS is the scattering length in total spin
the total spin S of the two particles involved. US ∼
S = 0, 2 channel. Excited states with S = 1 are not allowed due to the identity of the Bosons with one orbital state
per well.

We next construct, in the standard manner, the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the spins in the subspace of exactly one
(ERVx,y,z)1/2 of higher orbital states in the wells:
particle per well, assuming
this latter inequality is typically satisﬁed since aS << λ [3]). Let us ﬁrst consider two sites, labelled by 1 and 2. For
t
0 the energy is independent of the spin conﬁgurations. For ﬁnite but small t, we can perform perturbation in t.
It is convenient to classify the states according to the total spin Stot of the two sites. To second order in t, the energy

1, 1 for Stot = 0, 1, 2 respectively, we ﬁnd that the eﬀective
Hamiltonian can be written as

Thus the Hamiltonian (1) diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the Heisenberg one [9] familiar in ionic crystals. There, although
the total spin of an ion can be larger than 1/2 and hence (S1 ·
S2)2 are independent operators, the
Hamiltonian can, to a good approximation (ignoring spin-orbit interactions etc), be written simply as ˆHHei = J(S1 ·

Another peculiar fact about Hamiltonian (1) is also apparant. If the spins were classical vectors, K < J < 0 would
require that the two spin vectors be parrallel in the lowest energy state. However, since U2 > U0 > 0, ES=0 < ES=2
and hence the spins on the two sites actually prefer to be anti-ferromagnetically correlated. The strong quantum
mechanical nature of the spins will be of signiﬁcance below.

Let us now begin with the case where Vx << Vy,z, so that one can ignore couplings along y and z directions. We
thus have a collection of one-dimensional spin-1 chains. Ignoring the ǫ term in eq (1) not of relevance below, our
eﬀective Hamiltonian is thus (for one chain)

[or any other state obtained by applying the lowering operator Stot,− arbitary (limited only by twice the number of
sites) number of times], with energy per site Ef erro = cosγ + sinγ, becomes more stable than the nematic phase. Thus
the nematic phase has no regime of stability for the Hamiltonian in eq (3).

The ansatz wavefunction (7) does not have deﬁnite total spin Stot unless ζ = 1. Moreover, the wavefunction should
be improved by including spin-wave ﬂuctuations. However, we expect that the projection onto deﬁnite Stot [16] and
correcting the states with correlations between pairs will not change qualitatively the picture given above.

Consider now ﬁnite Vy but still Vz → ∞

. We thus now have a collection of two dimensional spin-1 lattices. In
general the tunneling matrix elements along the x and y directions, hence the strength of the eﬀective spin interactions,
can be unequal. The eﬀective spin Hamiltonian for our lattice is of the same form as eq (2), except that we need
two labels (lx, ly) for each the lattice point, and the interactions can be between nearest neighbor pairs along both
the x and y directions, with interaction constants Jx,y, Kx,y. With ty = δ1/2
tx, we have Jy = δyJx and Ky = δyKx.
Without loss in generality we can take 0 < δy < 1. Since the excitations of the dimer phase are gapped [10,12], we
expect that the dimer phase is stable at least for small δy. It is straight-forward to generalize our ansatz (5) (7)
above to the two dimensional case, with schematic wavefunction as shown in Fig 1 (b). For each site, there is one
”strong” bond along x-direction with energy as in eq (8), one ”weak” bond also along x with energy as in eq (9), and
two ”weak” bonds along y direction with total energy given by 2δy times eq (9). From this total energy, we can see
that our discussions for one dimension is basically unaﬀected. In particular since eq (9) does not contribute any term
linear in η = ζ−1, the discussions below eq. (12) is qualitatively unchanged. Within our ansatz, the nematic phase is

Under the above variational ansatz, the states are degenerate with respect to the spatial arrangements of the pairs.
In particular, the ansatz wavefunctions corresponding to Fig 1 (b) and (c), with the pairs forming a rectangular
and triangular lattice respectively, are completely degenerate in energy. However, this degeneracy will be lifted once
spin-wave ﬂuctuations are taken into account. For ζ = 1 the spin wave spectrum can be found as in ref [12]. There are

small δy, we ﬁnd that the rectangular lattice has lower energy. Assuming that the lattice type applies for the entire
region of γ of interest here, we conclude that the ground state for two dimensions should be as shown in Fig 1 (b).
Similar considerations suggest that, for three dimensions, the lattice for ground state should be tetragonal.

The distinguishing property of the dimer state is the doubling of the unit cell, while the spins do not have long
range order. Thus the periodicity of the excitations with period ∆q = π/a = k = 2π/λ for a certain direction (x
above) would be the signature of the dimer state. These excitations can in principle be detected by scattering.

In conclusion, we have pointed out that the trapped Bosonic atoms provide the opportunity to realize a quantum
mechanical state predicted in theory of quantum magnetism so far not tested experimentally. Obtaining this state in
the laboratory would further widen our the play-ground for quantum many-body systems

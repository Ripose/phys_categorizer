Abstract

Imidogen (NH) radicals are magnetically trapped and their Zeeman relaxation and energy trans-

port collision cross sections with helium are measured. Continuous buﬀer-gas loading of the trap is

direct from a room-temperature molecular beam. The Zeeman relaxation (inelastic) cross section

of magnetically trapped electronic, vibrational and rotational ground state imidogen in collisions
10−19 cm2 at 710 mK. The NH-He energy transport cross

with 3He is measured to be 3.8

Driven by the promise of new physics and applications, the ﬁeld of cold molecular physics

has undergone tremendous growth in the past decade [2, 3]. In particular, polar molecules

have been proposed [4, 5] as qubits for quantum information processing and for studies

of highly correlated condensed matter systems [6]. Cold molecules are also very promis-

ing candidates for fundamental physics measurements, such as the search for the electric

dipole moment of the electron [7] and time variation of the electron-proton mass ratio [8].

Chemistry with cold molecules may be possible to observe in a new quantum regime where

the large deBroglie wavelength and long interaction times of reactants can reopen chemical

reaction pathways through tunneling [9, 10]. A key to realizing these new phenomena is the

production of cold, trapped, high-density samples of polar molecules.

The complexity inherent in molecules, compared to atoms, makes working with them

diﬃcult; the rich internal structure of molecules opens decay modes that, for example, could

make evaporative cooling diﬃcult to achieve [11]. Preparation of cold, dense samples of

trapped molecules should provide a pathway to measure cold molecule collisions, critical

to elucidating the suitability of molecules for evaporative [12, 13] and sympathetic cooling

[14]. So far, several methods have been used to create (ultra-)cold molecules. Production

of ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms has been realized through photo and Feshbach

association [15, 16]. Direct cooling of initially hot polar molecules has also been demon-

strated using Stark deceleration [3, 17], optical slowing [18], billiard-like collisions [19], and

buﬀer-gas cooling [20]. Buﬀer gas cooling uses cryogenic helium gas to cool hot molecules (or

atoms). When done in the presence of a magnetic trapping ﬁeld this can cause the molecules

to fall into the conservative trap potential. The ﬁrst successful trapping of polar molecules

was accomplished in our group with buﬀer-gas loading of CaH, and we know of several other

laboratories using buﬀer-gas loading of magnetic traps [21, 22, 23]. Other molecules (VO

[24], CaF [25] and CrH [26]) have also been studied with buﬀer-gas loading but in all those

cases there were loss mechanisms that prevented trapping for extended periods of time.

Despite great progress in the ﬁeld of cold molecules, no technique has yet realized trapped

densities suﬃciently high to observe polar molecule-molecule collisions. However, the buﬀer

gas method allowed studies of cold atom-polar molecule spin relaxation of trapped molecules

(He-CaH and CaF [20, 25]). These measurements in combination with theory began to un-

cover the fundamental processes of cold molecule collisions in traps. CaH has a 2Σ ground

state, perhaps the simplest type of magnetically trappable molecule. Although this provided

2

important information on the nature of cold molecule collisions, it was incomplete as there

are a variety of molecules. For example, 3Σ molecules carry with them new internal dynam-

ics, such as the spin-spin interaction, which allows for direct coupling of the rotation during

a collision (unlike the 2Σ case) [27]. The current vigorous pursuit of high density samples of

cold molecules has led several groups to the imidogen (NH) radical. Cold, trapped imido-

gen is being studied theoretically [1, 13, 14] and pursued experimentally [28, 29, 30], and a

scheme for continuous loading of imidogen into a magnetic trap has been proposed for Stark

deceleration [31].

In this Letter, we demonstrate magnetic trapping of ground state (X 3Σ−) imidogen
radicals and make a direct measurement of the spin relaxation rate in collisions with 3He.

Imidogen is continuously loaded directly from a room-temperature molecular beam into a

magnetic trap via buﬀer-gas cooling. More than 108 molecules are loaded into the trap and

are observed for longer than 1 s, with 1/e lifetimes exceeding 200 ms. The energy transport

collision rate is also measured, allowing the determination of the ratio of the diﬀusive to

inelastic cross sections in this system, found to be γ = σd/σin = 7

104.

×

We chose to study imidogen (NH) due to its internal structure, predicted collisional
properties, and for technical reasons. The X 3Σ− ground state has a 2µB magnetic moment

ammonia discharge [32] and detected in absorption or ﬂuorescence on the A3Π

and 1.38 Debye electric dipole moment. The imidogen radicals can be produced in an
X 3Σ−
transition (336 nm, 1/A = 400 ns). It has been predicted [1] that 3Σ molecules with relatively

↔

large rotational splitting and weak spin-spin interaction (such as the imidogen radical) will

be less likely to undergo collision induced Zeeman transitions. Another important feature

of the NH system is that imidogen can be produced in a high ﬂux beam with a room

temperature discharge source [29]. This provides a new challenge - the introduction of this

beam into our very low temperature trapping region. This was a key experimental challenge

that was met with success and can be applied to numerous other species.

Our apparatus is centered around a cold cell made from copper [36] and is thermally

disconnected from the 4 K magnet surrounding it (see Fig. 1). The maximum trap depth

available is 3.9 Tesla. Windows at the magnet midplane allow optical access for laser beams

and a ﬂuorescence collection lens. The cell is thermally connected to a 3He refrigerator,

giving the cell a base temperature of 450 mK.

Buﬀer gas enters the cell through a ﬁll line and exits out a 3 mm diameter opening in

3

the side of the cell that faces the discharge source (the “molecular beam input aperture”

shown in Fig. 1). Helium is continuously supplied to the cell in order to maintain a constant

helium atom density in the trapping region.

The constant ﬂow of helium buﬀer gas out of the cell aperture poses a signiﬁcant technical

problem. The helium gas can scatter imidogen radicals out of the incident NH beam before

they enter the trapping cell. In order to maintain suﬃcient vacuum just outside the cell, a

charcoal coated copper tube (“charcoal tube”) is used to pump away the escaping helium.

The charcoal tube is held at 4 K so as to act as a low-proﬁle high-speed vacuum pump. This

eliminates any signiﬁcant scattering of imidogen radicals.

The helium buﬀer gas density in the cell is determined by the rate at which we ﬂow

helium into the cell and the conductance out of the molecular beam input aperture. The

conductance of the molecular beam input aperture was measured using a fast ion gauge,

agreeing with our calculated theoretical value. This system allows both experimental control

and absolute knowledge of the buﬀer-gas density to better than 20%.

The imidogen radicals in the trapping region are detected using laser induced ﬂuorescence

(LIF) excited on the

A3Π2, v′ = 0, N ′ = 1

X 3Σ−, v′′ = 0, N ′′ = 0

transition. The light

|

i ← |

i

source is a CW dye laser frequency doubled in BBO in an external buildup cavity. The

excitation laser beam enters the cell and passes through the trap center along a diameter

before exiting. Fluorescence from A

X is collected by a midplane lens perpendicular to

→

both the laser and molecular beam axes and imaged to the face of a photomultiplier tube

(PMT). In this way, time-resolved narrow-band spectra of trapped imidogen radicals are

gathered. As the spherical quadrupole ﬁeld of the trap magnet is strongly inhomogeneous

and the LIF line frequency is ﬁeld-dependent, laser frequency maps directly to distance from

the trap center.

Figure 2 shows a series of time proﬁles of the number of trapped imidogen molecules for

several diﬀerent loading times. This signal is simply the PMT count rate versus time using

an LIF excitation frequency set to the peak of the trapped imidogen spectral feature. As

this is a ﬂuorescence experiment, the absolute number of molecules is diﬃcult to determine

accurately. By calculating the eﬃciency of our detection system, excitation probability, and

detected molecule fraction we can, however, put a lower bound on our initial number of

trapped imidogen radicals of > 108. The data shown in Fig. 2 was taken with 4He, so the

temperature of the buﬀer-gas cell was elevated to 730 mK (in order to maintain suﬃcient

4

4He density) at a trap depth of 3.3 Tesla. Each trace corresponds to a diﬀerent duration

of loading from the molecular beam source - the tail ends of all four traces ﬁt well to a

single-exponential decay with time constant of 90

10 ms. For loading times less than the

±

molecular trap lifetime, the number of trapped molecules increases nearly in proportion with

with loading time (see curves (a), (b) and (c)). This demonstrates one of the key features of

the continuous molecular beam loading technique: as the lifetime of molecules in the trap

increases, the loading time can be increased resulting in more trapped molecules. Ablation

sources for buﬀer-gas loading experiments have to this point shown insigniﬁcant increases

in numbers trapped from multiple loading pulses, likely due to the violent nature of the

ablation plume in the trapping region. Fig. 2(c,d) shows that as the loading time exceeds

the trap lifetime the signal height saturates and there is no longer any signiﬁcant increase

in the number of trapped molecules, as expected.

Trapping is spectroscopically veriﬁed by tuning the LIF laser to be resonant with high-

ﬁeld-seeking (HFS) molecules and comparing time proﬁles to low-ﬁeld seekers (LFS). The

HFS molecules quickly leave the trap and are undetectable after 10 ms while the lifetimes of

the LFS molecules are enhanced to more than 200 ms at our lowest loading temperature. The

spatial sensitivity of our ﬂuorescence collection precludes ﬁtting the spectra for temperature,

but we have previously demonstrated rotational and translational thermalization of imidogen

to the buﬀer gas temperature [29]. Finally, as described below, only trapped molecules

produce the lifetimes vs. trap depths that we observe.

In the absence of collisional losses, the trap lifetime will increase signiﬁcantly as trap

depth increases and the magnetic trapping ﬁeld holds molecules in the center of the cell.

With background buﬀer gas present, there is an additional lifetime lengthening factor as

collisions with helium atoms slow motion of trapped molecules to the walls, essentially

enforcing diﬀusive motion. Fig. 3(a) (inset) shows the measured trap lifetime as a function

of η

µBmax/kBT , where µBmax is the trap depth. The lifetime is plotted in units of the

calculated by Krems et al. in Ref. [1].

Figure 3(b) shows the measured trap lifetime for diﬀerent buﬀer-gas densities. The peak

lifetime in this study is somewhat low since cell was heated to 710 mK in order to maintain

a constant temperature throughout the full buﬀer-gas density range (a technical artifact of

the helium gas supply system). Trapped imidogen lifetimes for the base temperature of the

cell exceed 200 ms. As the density of the 3He buﬀer gas is increased from 1014 to around 1015
cm−3 the lifetime of the trapped molecules increases due to the diﬀusion eﬀect mentioned
above. However, as the 3He density is increased past 1015 cm−3 it is seen that the lifetime

decreases. This decrease is due to collision-induced Zeeman relaxation of the imidogen

radicals as they collide with 3He. The time proﬁles still show good single-exponential decay

behavior for these higher buﬀer-gas densities.

To extract a rate constant for these inelastic collisions, we ﬁt a model curve to the data

in Fig. 3. After being loaded, the time proﬁle of the molecule number in the trap can be
modeled as N(t) = Noe−tA/ne−tnkin where n is the buﬀer gas density, No is the initial number

of imidogen radicals after loading, and A and kin are ﬁtting parameters corresponding to

diﬀusion enhancement of the lifetime and inelastic collision loss, respectively. This can be

rewritten as a single exponential with a time constant given by 1/τeﬀ = A/n + nkin, which

induced Zeeman relaxation rate at 710 mK and is found to be kin = 3.0

gives the form for the curve ﬁtted to the data in Fig. 3. The constant kin is the collision
10−15 cm3s−1,
×
10−19 cm2 and therefore a ratio
104. The uncertainties are systematic and

are dominated by uncertainty in the absolute buﬀer-gas density. This inelastic collision rate
10−16 cm3s−1 for 100 Gauss

is an order of magnitude higher than the 500 mK value of 4.20

×

given by Krems et al. [1] and may be larger due to the strong temperature dependence of the

predicted shape resonance. Furthermore, the rate we measure is averaged over the magnetic

×

6

ﬁeld range of our trap, and inelastic collision cross sections are predicted to become strongly

ﬁeld-dependent just below this collision energy [1].

In summary, we have demonstrated magnetic trapping of ground state imidogen molecules

using buﬀer gas loading from a molecular beam. The energy transport (diﬀusion) and

inelastic collision rate constants for NH-3He have been measured

resulting in a ratio of elastic to inelastic collision rates of 7

104, which indicates that

×

imidogen radicals should be amenable to the pumping out of the buﬀer gas and thermal

isolation. It is particularly interesting to note that we are able to trap imidogen near the

peak of the narrow shape resonance predicted by Krems et al.

in Ref.

[1]. A factor of

two decrease (or increase) in collision energy would decrease the inelastic rate by more than

a factor of ten, resulting in a increase in γ to nearly 106. This bodes very well for both

increasing the number of trapped molecules and perhaps for sympathetic cooling of large

numbers of imidogen radicals and other hydrides to the ultracold regime.

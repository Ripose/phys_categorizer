The a(1) state of PbO can be used to measure the electric dipole moment of the electron de. We
discuss a semiempirical model for this state, which yields an estimate of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld
on the valence electrons in PbO. Our ﬁnal result is an upper limit on the measurable energy shift,
Wd
which is signiﬁcantly larger than was anticipated earlier: 2

In his pioneering work, Sandars pointed out that the
eﬀective electric ﬁeld on a valence electron in a heavy
α2Z 3 relative to the ap-
atom is enhanced by a factor
plied laboratory ﬁeld [1]. That started a long search for
the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron de in
atomic experiments ([2]). The most stringent limit on de
follows from an experiment on atomic Tl (Z=81) [3].

∼

Even larger enhancement is present in heavy polar di-
atomic molecules [2, 4, 5]. The heavy atom there is sub-
109 V/cm,
jected to an internal E-ﬁeld of
which is further enhanced by the relativistic factor α2Z 3.
This eﬀective ﬁeld is many orders of magnitude larger
than available laboratory ﬁelds; this makes diatomic
molecules very attractive systems to look for de.

Since de is linked to the electron spin, one must work
either with radicals, which have an unpaired electron
in the ground state, or with excited states of “normal”
molecules. Diatomic radicals with the ground state Σ1/2
have large enhancement factors which can be relatively
easily calculated [6, 7]. The ﬁrst results of an EDM mea-
surement in such a molecule (YbF) were recently pub-
lished [8, 9]. The molecule PbO is a favorable candidate
for a search for de in the excited state a(1) [4, 10], and the
group at Yale has begun EDM experiments on PbO [11].
It is therefore timely to estimate the eﬀective internal
ﬁeld for the state a(1) of PbO.

The interaction of de with an electric ﬁeld E can be

written in four-component Dirac notation as [12]:

Hd = 2de (cid:18)

0
0
0 σE (cid:19)

.

After averaging over the electronic wavefunction this in-
teraction can be expressed in terms of an eﬀective spin-
rotational Hamiltonian [5, 6]:

n),

H ef f
d = Wd de (Je ·
where Je is the electronic angular momentum and n is
the unit vector along the molecular axis. In this paper
we estimate Wd for the molecular state a(1):

where we used that
Ω[a(1)] = 1. The
a(1)
|
h
Ω-doubling for states with Ω = 1 is very small and even
in a weak external electric ﬁeld the energy eigenstates
correspond to deﬁnite Ω rather than deﬁnite parity. The
energy of the molecule can be then written as:

where B is the rotational constant, E0 is the external
electric ﬁeld, and D is the molecular dipole moment. The
EDM contribution can be determined from the diﬀerence:

W (J, M, Ω)

W (J,

M,

Ω) = 2Wd de.

In order to estimate the matrix element in Eq. (3) we
construct here a semiempirical wavefunction of the state
a(1). We use the MO LCAO approach, where each molec-
ular orbital is expressed as a linear combination of atomic
orbitals, and all molecular matrix elements are reduced
to the sums of atomic matrix elements. The HFS or SO
interactions as well as the EDM enhancement factor grow
very rapidly with nuclear charge Z. Therefore, we are in-
terested only in the Pb part of the MO LCAO expansion.
Analysis of the molecular observables requires knowl-
edge of several atomic matrix elements for Pb. We cal-
culate these in the Dirac-Fock approximation both for
neutral Pb and for Pb+. Results are given in Table I for
the orbitals 6s and 6pj. For the HFS operator we calcu-
late the parameters hk,k′ as deﬁned in [5] (we use atomic
units unless the opposite is stated explicitly):

The last row of Table I gives the ratio of the radial

ratios are similar for all relevant integrals, and a simple
relation between wsp and HFS constants holds for both
cases:

This relation is critical for semiempirical models of the
EDM enhancement: it implies that the value of the EDM
enhancement does not depend on what set of radial inte-
grals (i.e. atomic or ionic) is used. Similarly (9) holds for
other principal quantum numbers n, e.g. for 7s and 7pj.
The particular choice of the radial integrals becomes im-
portant for the normalization of the wavefunction. The
Pb atom in PbO is positively charged; therefore, below
we use the ionic set of integrals from Table I.

In order to develop a semi-empirical model for the state
a(1), we have found it necessary to also consider the
wavefunctions of several low-lying states of PbO. Pre-
vious work has shown that these states correspond to
the conﬁgurations and nominal Λ, Σ-coupling terms as
follows [13, 14]:

0 ] : σ2

In the naive ionic model of PbO, the two 6p electrons
from Pb move to O and close its 2p-shell. This suggests
that the orbitals σ1,2 and π1 are centered on O, and that
σ3 is predominantly of the Pb 6s-type. However, below
we do not impose any constraints on the MO LCAO coef-
ﬁcients for these molecular orbitals, based on this expec-
tation. Note that only the orbitals σ3 and π1,2 contribute

2

to the spin-density of the molecular states under consid-
eration. Thus, we do not need to know the orbitals σ1,2,
and below we omit the index for the orbital σ3.

Now we specify coeﬃcients of the MO LCAO expan-

sion for the three valence orbitals of interest:

λ: λ = 0(1) for σ(π) orbitals. In order to calculate Wd
we must determine the 4 parameters in Eqs. (13). Below
we try to constrain these parameters using experimental
information about states (11) and (12). To simplify the
notation, we deﬁne the ground state of the molecule as
vacuum. Then each of the excited states in Eqs. (11)
and (12) is a two-particle state with one hole and one
electron. We do not use any special notation for the hole
states; instead we simply write the hole orbital in front
of the electron one. We construct wavefunctions of these
states from the orbitals (13), using at the ﬁrst stage the
Λ, Σ-coupling scheme classiﬁcation:

where we applied the time-reversal operation T . Thus the
ﬁnal sign depends on the time-reversal symmetry of ˆP ,
with the minus sign corresponding to a T -even electronic
operator. For example, the HFS interaction is given by
the product of the T -odd electronic vector ˆAJe and the
nuclear spin I. Thus, for the HFS interaction the plus

sign in Eq. (15) is correct. A similar argument shows
that the SO constant ξ for a hole has the opposite sign
as for an electron.

From Eqs. (14), the ﬁrst-order SO splitting ∆AB be-

tween states A(0+) and B(1) is:

The signs of the parameters s1,2 should be chosen so that
the contribution of atomic orbital 6p1/2 to the molecular
orbital σ is increased: in this case relativistic corrections
to the binding energy of the σ orbital are positive.

We see that the orbital π2 has a large contribution from
the Pb orbital 6p. The data on energy levels [15] shows
then that for all levels with one electron in the π2 or-
bital, the SO interaction is comparable to the splittings
between these levels. Therefore, there must be signiﬁcant
SO mixing between such states.

(Note that the formulae of Ref. [5] are strictly applicable
only for orbitals and states with ω = Ω = 1/2. Eq. (28)
takes into account simple modiﬁcations of these formulae
for the present situation.)

We now have ﬁve equations, namely: (17), (19), (23),
(26), and (28) on seven parameters of the wavefunction
(24). That leaves us with two independent parameters
of the model. We introduce two additional constraints,
which account for normalization and the Pauli principle:

We choose N0 = 1.2 here in order to account for inac-
curacy of the Hartree-Fock approximation used to deter-
mine the atomic parameters in Table I.

The parameters α and P2 are unambiguously ﬁxed by
Eqs. (17) and (19). We choose s1 and P1 as free param-
eters and solve Eqs. (23), (26), and (28) for parameters
s2, Sp and Ss. After that we reject solutions which do
not meet the constraints (29). A typical solution is:

P2 = 0.714;
α = 0.3;
s1 = 0.107; P1 = 0.503;
s2 = 0.449; Sp = 0.349; Ss = 0.812.

The parameter P1 appears to be restricted only by the
normalization condition (29).

It may be possible to add some restrictions to reduce
the ranges of variation in Eq. (31). For example, the
relatively large value of s2 should require a large value
of Sp. However, such additional restrictions would add
arbitrariness to the model and may aﬀect its reliability.
We use only the minimal set of constraints to determine
the range of possible values of Wd.

For the wavefunction (24), there are two contributions
to the EDM parameter Wd from each of the one-electron
orbitals with

We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst term in (32b) always dominates
the sum. The second term is not negligible, but the ﬁnal
two terms contribute <
10%. It is important that the
∼
leading contribution to Wd is similar to the ﬁrst term in
Eq. (28), which dominates the HFS. This implies that the
parameter Wd is well-constrained even though some of
the parameters of the wavefunction are not. We obtain:

Wd|

= 16.6

3.0 a.u.,

(33)

where the uncertainty reﬂects the range of values found
within the model just described.

It is also important to check how Wd depends on the
“ﬁxed” parameters α and P2, as well as on the input data
for Ak and Gk, since our model relating the MO LCAO
coeﬃcients to these parameters is rather crude. In Ta-
ble II we solve the model equations for values of these
quantities varying from the best values by
20%. We
ﬁnd that this variation of the input parameters widens
5.4 a.u.), but still
the range for Wd substantially (to
does not allow dramatically smaller values of Wd.

±

±

It is known from previous calculations of Wd for other
diatomic molecules, that correlation corrections tend to

4

decrease the result by 10–20% from the Hartree-Fock
level. Therefore, we state our ﬁnal result as a conser-
vative lower limit on Wd:

Wd| ≥

(34)

This lower bound is several times larger than earlier,
naive estimates which did not consider the eﬀect of SO
mixing on the (nominally) π-type orbitals of the a(1)
state [5]. Our model shows signiﬁcant similarity between
the orbital ˜π2,1/2 in PbO and the single valence orbital in
the ground state of the free radical PbF. It is thus nat-
ural that our bound is close to the value calculated for
PbF [21]. (Coincidentally, our bound is also similar to
the calculated value for YbF [17, 18, 19, 20].) However,
we stress that this ﬁrst semiempirical estimate of the ef-
fective ﬁeld in PbO has very limited accuracy. Thus,
more elaborate calculations of the a(1) state are highly
desirable.

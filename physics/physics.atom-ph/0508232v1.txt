We investigate quantum electrodynamic effects under the inﬂuence of an external, time-dependent electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, which mediates dynamic modiﬁcations of the radiative corrections. Speciﬁcally, we consider
the quantum electrodynamic vacuum-polarization tensor under the inﬂuence of two external background ﬁelds:
a strong laser ﬁeld and a nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld. We calculate the charge and current densities induced by a
nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld in the presence of a laser ﬁeld. We ﬁnd the corresponding induced scalar and vector po-
tentials. The induced potential, in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, leads to a correction to atomic energy levels.
The external laser ﬁeld breaks the rotational symmetry of the system. Consequently, the induced charge density
is not spherically symmetric, and the energy correction therefore leads to a “polarized Lamb shift.” In partic-
ular, the laser generates an additional potential with a quadrupole moment. The corresponding laser-dressed
vacuum-polarization potential behaves like 1/r3 at large distances, unlike the Uehling potential that vanishes
exponentially for large r. The energy corrections are of the same order-of-magnitude for hydrogenic levels, ir-
respective of the angular momentum quantum number. The induced current leads to a transition dipole moment
which oscillates at the second harmonic of the laser frequency and is mediated by second-order harmonic gen-
eration in the vacuum-polarization loop. In the far ﬁeld, at distances r ≫ 1/ω from the nucleus (ω is the laser
frequency), the laser induces mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which give rise to an energy
ﬂux that corresponds to photon fusion leading to the generation of real photons, again at the second harmonic
of the laser. Our investigation might be useful for other situations where quantum ﬁeld theoretic phenomena are
subjected to external ﬁelds of a rather involved structure.

INTRODUCTION

This article is concerned with the calculation of the
vacuum-polarization tensor in the presence of two nontrivial
background ﬁelds: a nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld and a (possibly
strong) laser ﬁeld. Particular emphasis is laid on the induced
charge density and potential, as well as the induced current
and the vector potential, and the resulting induced electromag-
netic ﬁelds. As an application, we consider the energy shifts
of atomic states in hydrogenlike systems, and induced transi-
tion probabilities, under the inﬂuence of the laser-dressed vac-
uum polarization. However, we would like to emphasize that
the two latter aspects constitute merely example applications
of the more general expressions derived in this article.

×

Before we indulge into this endeavour, let us brieﬂy re-
call a few very well known facts about vacuum polarization.
It is well known that the Coulomb law becomes invalid at
distances comparable to the electron Compton wavelength
10−11 cm. This phenomenon is due to the excita-
λe = 3.8
tion of virtual electron-positron pairs from the vacuum, which
polarize the vacuum in a way approximately equivalent to a
dielectric medium. Indeed, at large distance, we see only a
“screened” charge, which is less than the “bare” charge visible
to an observer who approaches the particle in question, in our
case mostly an atomic nucleus, to a very close distance. The
total charge density induced in the vacuum has to be zero, and
this also deﬁnes the renormalization condition for the charge
which can be deﬁned via the low-energy limit of the Thom-
son scattering cross section (see [1], Chap. 7), as it affects two
distant charge particles. However, as we enter the cloud of the

electron-positron pairs that surround the charged nucleus, the
effective charge becomes larger, because one has to add to the
“renormalized”, physical charge of the nucleus (seen at large
distance), a contribution due to the electron-positron pairs that
surround the nucleus at short distance.

So,

the virtual excitations of the electron-positron (or
muon-antimuon) pairs naturally generate a “ﬁfth-force” like
Yukawa potential contribution to the Coulomb law, which
is however exponentially suppressed at distances larger than
the Compton wavelength, and by a quantum electrodynamic
(QED) perturbation theory parameter α.

What happens to the vacuum-polarization effects in a laser
ﬁeld? Evidently, the laser ﬁeld, which is composed of many
photons, will modify the electron-positron loop as the laser
photons interact with the virtual quanta during their short life-
10−21 s. We ﬁnd
time that is only of the order of λe/c = 1.3
that in a remarkably strong laser ﬁeld, the modiﬁcation of the
vacuum-polarization contribution to the Coulomb law can be
signiﬁcant. In particular, the laser induces a rotational symme-
try breaking in the correction to the Coulomb law, which leads
to a polarized Lamb shift whereby states with different mag-
netic quantum numbers receive different energy shifts. The
induced charge density, in a laser ﬁeld, has a monopole and a
quadrupole component. The quadrupole part of the potential
is not exponentially suppressed at large distances, but tails off
like a “normal” quadrupole potential, i.e. as 1/r3.

×

In part, our investigation follows ideas outlined previously
in the context of the analysis of the vacuum-polarization ten-
sor in a laser ﬁeld [2, 3]. Here, our focus is on applications
including a (possibly strong) binding Coulomb ﬁeld in addi-

tion to the laser ﬁeld. Another fundamental QED process, the
self-energy under the inﬂuence of an external laser ﬁeld, for a
free particle, has previously been studied in [4, 5], and for a
strongly driven transition between bound states, in [6, 7, 8, 9].
A more general context of our study might be deﬁned as
“quantum ﬁeld theory under the inﬂuence of external ﬁelds.”
From a naive point of view, one might expect that in a
strong laser ﬁeld, the charge density induced by the vacuum
polarization loses the rotational symmetry, and that an align-
ment along the laser propagation and polarization axes oc-
curs. However, the exact functional form of the induced laser-
dressed contribution to the charge density [see Eq. (26) be-
low] is not accessible by symmetry arguments. It is therefore
indispensable to use a fully laser-dressed formalism, where
the quantum electrodynamic effects are incorporated into the
propagators right from the start of the calculation. As will be
discussed below, the result of a fully laser-dressed calculation
conﬁrms the intuitive picture, according to which rotational
invariance is broken in both linear as well as circularly polar-
ized laser ﬁelds, and a few unexpected asymptotic structures
are found for the laser-induced ﬁelds.

This article is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we analyze
the additional charge density induced by the external laser
ﬁeld (this potential is an addition to the “normal” Uehling
potential). The way from the charge density to the induced
potential is detailed in Sec. II A. The asymptotics of the in-
duced potential, in various regions from the atomic nucleus,
are derived in Sec. II B. As an application, the energy shift of
hydrogenic bound states is considered in Sec. II C.

Here, the four-vectors k1 and k2 characterize the incoming

the laser-dressed loop. The polarization vectors of the pho-
tons are εµ
2 . The quantity Tµ ν(k2, k1) is canonically
identiﬁed as the vacuum-polarization tensor. The calculation
of the tensor Tµ ν(k2, k1) is a rather involved calculation, but
complete results, valid for arbitrary laser-ﬁeld conﬁgurations,
were found with the use of operator techniques in Ref. [2].
Independently, by means of another method, the vacuum-
polarization tensor was obtained in Ref. [3]. Both results are
in agreement with each other. Of course, the scattering, which
is beyond Maxwell’s classical electrodynamics, appears due
to the polarization of the electron-positron vacuum in the pres-
ence of a laser ﬁeld.

In this article, we use rationalized Gaussian units with ~ =
c = 1, and ǫ0 = (4π)−1, which implies e2 = α where e is
the electron charge and α is the ﬁne-structure constant. We
represent the vector potential of the laser ﬁeld in the form

Aµ(φ) = e1µψ1(φ) + e2µψ2(φ) .

same as in Fig. 2: the z-axis is the laser propagation direction, and
the x-axis is the polarization axis (laser electric ﬁeld). The picture
provides a ray-traced impression of the charge density, represented as
an absorptive medium. Red color is used for positive induced charge
(areas located along the x and y axes), blue color is used for negative
charge (areas located along the z axis). The plots are as seen by an
observer looking at the atomic nucleus from the speciﬁed directions.
This is in contrast to Fig. 2, where the isosurface corresponding to
a given, constant charge density is plotted. In the above graphical
representations, the fall-off of the induced charge density for large
radial arguments can be distinguished clearly.

the Wichmann–Kroll parts (for a review see e.g. [10]). The result for
δρR

space result given in Eq. (18) below, into coordinate space. Along the
vertical axis, we have the propagation direction of the laser, which we
assume to be linearly polarized (ξ2
2 = 0). The polarization
direction (laser electric ﬁeld) is along the x-axis. We plot a charac-
teristic surface given by a constant induced charge density, namely
the surface deﬁned by the relation δρ0(~r) = 2α

aligned mainly along the y axis, K = +1.204) and a negative one
are distinguished (the latter is in blue color and located along the
propagation axis, K = −1.204). As emphasized in the text, the total
induced charge is zero.

Thus, we may say that the parameters ξ1,2 measure the laser
ﬁeld strength. The parameter λ, by contrast, measures the mo-
mentum scales relevant to the vacuum-polarization loop (in-
coming momenta and the four-momentum of the laser wave)
against the electron mass scale.

As is well known, the presence of an external ﬁeld leads
to the existence of an induced current J µ due to the vacuum
polarization.
If the external ﬁeld is a pure Coulomb ﬁeld,
then for the induced current we have ~J = 0, and ρ = J 0
is well known in this case (see, e.g., [11]). Here, we consider
the situation where the external ﬁeld is a Coulomb ﬁeld, but
there is, in addition, the laser ﬁeld, which dresses the vacuum-
polarization loop.

Our incoming photon is the Coulomb quantum with k1 =
q = (0, ~q) and εµ
0 . Then, J µ = T µ 0(k2, k1). We
calculate J µ in the leading approximation in the parameter

In the derivation of Eq. (12), we have neglected higher-order
terms in the expansion in powers of ω/m. The Fourier trans-
form of the correction to the induced charge density due to the
laser ﬁeld, δρ(~q, t), is essentially given by the Fourier trans-
form of T 0 0(k2, q). It is a sum of time-dependent and time-
independent parts:

δρ(~q, t) = δρ0(~q) + δρ1(~q, t) ,

(14)

which typically gives rise to the main corrections to the en-
ergy in bound systems (a0 is the Bohr radius). For a laser
whose frequency is of the order of atomic transitions, we have

Although the expression for the vacuum polarization tensor
in Eqs. (2.5), (2.31) and (2.32) of Ref. [2] is in principle al-
ready renormalized, it is still necessary to carry out an addi-
tional ﬁnite subtraction, namely, to subtract the asymptotics
of the induced charge at
0. This is akin to the ad-
~q
| →
|
ditional subtractions that have to be carried out in the calcu-
lation of the Wichmann–Kroll correction. The renormaliza-
tion condition in the on-mass-shell scheme, for the Coulomb
ﬁeld is that two distant observers should observe exactly the
Thomson scattering cross section, which implies that the total
induced charge has to be equal to zero (an eludicating discus-
sion surrounds Eq. (7.18) of Ref. [1]). In addition, our sub-

5

traction provides a ﬁnite quadrupole moment, corresponding
to the induced charge distribution. Because δρ1(~q, t)
0
0 [see Eq.(15)], it is only the time-independent part
at
δρ0(~q) which receives an additional, ﬁnite renormalization.

In principle, the expressions (23) gives the complete answer
for the induced potential, which is necessary for the calcula-
tion of the energy shift. We reemphasize that the only addi-
tional approximation employed was λ
1, which is easily
fulﬁlled for current and planned high-intensity laser facilities.
Note that in the particular case of the circular polarized laser
ﬁeld (ξ1 =
ξ2 = ξ), the expression for the induced potential
becomes essentially simpler.

B. Asymptotics of the induced potential

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (26), proportional

The second term on the right-hand side of (26), proportional
to 1/r, reﬂects the existence of radiation in the system, but
cannot be used for a valid description of the radiation. The
reason is that the derivation of the asymptotics (26) was car-
ried out at distances 1/m
1/ω. This is insufﬁcient for
r
the consideration of radiation, which by deﬁnition is only a

well-deﬁned process at distances much larger than the wave-
length of the emitted light. For the calculation of the radiation,
1/ω (see Sec. III D)
it is necessary to consider distances r

As was already pointed out, for the purpose of calculating
the energy shift, it is necessary to know the time-independent

part of the potential (for the oscillatory terms,
the time-
averaging is applied over a full period of the driving laser).
The time-averaged part of the quadrupole moment has the

Let us consider the correction δE =

Eq.(23). For n s1/2-states, only the spherically symmetric part
of this potential gives a nonzero contribution. It is propor-
tional to the function F1(mr). Because the function F1(mr)
decreases exponentially at mr

In rewriting the result in terms of the total rather than orbital

interesting that the magnitude of the correction for l
= 0 is
of the same order as that for l = 0. This is in sharp con-
trast to the “normal” vacuum polarization in a Coulomb ﬁeld,
where the dominant effect is given by a potential of the form
(1/15) α Zα m2 δ(~r), which has a nonvanishing expecta-

−
tion value only for S states.

III.

INDUCED CURRENT AND VECTOR POTENTIAL

A. From the current to the vector potential

In a pure Coulomb ﬁeld acting as an external “condition”,
or source, it is well known that the spatial components of
the induced current vanish completely. The situation changes
drastically for an additional laser ﬁeld. Then, the spatial com-
ponents of the induced current no longer vanish, and that
constitutes an additional effect supplementing the vacuum-
induced laser-dressed charge density δρ, which exists in both
cases. We discuss the Fourier transform of the induced non-
vanishing current density ~J(~q, t). We employ analogous steps
as in the derivation of Eq. (11).

We deﬁne the following vector to represent the mixed
spatial-temporal components of the vacuum-polarization ten-
sor,

In passing, we note that ~H0(~r) of course has the transforma-
tion properties of a pseudovector, which is consistent with the

necessary introduction of the factor ~ν

(~e1 ×

·

~e2) in Eq. (51).

Also note that at all distances, ~H0(~r) is an odd function of the
vector ~n. Therefore, due to the parity conservation, for any
hydrogenic atomic state, the energy shift related to the mag-
netic ﬁeld vanishes in ﬁrst order of perturbation theory.

C. Application: transition probability in atoms

As shown in previous sections of this article, the laser-
dressed vacuum polarization induces additional electric and
magnetic ﬁelds which modify the atomic transition probabili-
ties. We perform the calculation to the ﬁrst order of pertur-
bation theory with respect to these ﬁelds. The most inter-
esting situation occurs when the laser frequency ω is closed
to ∆E/2, where ∆E is the energy interval between levels,
because the second-harmonic generation from the vacuum in
this case leads to the generation of resonance photons. For
simplicity, we restrict ourselves by the case of circular po-
larization and transition 1s
2p (which corresponds to the
→
electric dipole transition for spontaneous radiation). We direct
the quantization axis along the vector ~ν. Due to the conserva-
tion of angular momentum, the matrix element is nonzero if
2 only. The sign in this selection rule depends on the
∆jz =
helicity of the laser wave.

±

Taking into account the selection rule, let us consider, for
instance, the case of a right helicity of the laser wave and the
transition from the state 1s1/2 with jz =
1/2 to the state
2p3/2 with jz = 3/2. Because the induced potential Φ1(~r, t)
is an even function of the vector ~n, see Eq. (23), this poten-
tial does not contribute to the matrix element to the ﬁrst order
of perturbation theory, and the leading nonzero contribution
comes from the perturbation Hamiltonian

for the ratio of the vacuum-induced to the second-order in-
duced transition probability. The ratio r is very small for
Z = 1, and it is still only of order 10−8 for a medium-Z range
(Z
20). While it is not negligibly small for heavy ions, the
transition frequencies increase with increasing Z, and pow-
erful coherent lasers in this range of frequencies are still un-
available.

≈

In order to observe the phenomenon of inﬂuence of second-

order harmonic generation due to laser-dressed vacuum polar-
ization on the transition probability, it could be useful explore
whether transitions exist where the ratio r is more favourable
with regard to a possible experimental investigation. In this
case, a very careful estimate of the background would be re-
quired. For instance, the linewidth of even narrow lasers can
induce very small, but important transition probabilities far off
resonance, and these would also have to be taken into account
in such an analysis.

D. Application: photon fusion

Due to the vacuum polarization in the Coulomb ﬁeld, non-
linear QED processes such as Delbr¨uck scattering (coherent
photon scattering in the atomic electric ﬁeld) and photon split-
ting (transition of initial photon into two ﬁnal photons) appear.
These processes are investigated both theoretically and exper-
imentally, see Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15]. Another closely related

process is the photon fusion in an atomic ﬁeld. In this pro-
cess, two initial photons with the energy ω1 and ω2 transfer
to the one ﬁnal photon with the energy ω3 = ω1 + ω2. This
process has not been observed experimentally because of its
small probability.

The existence of the radiation phenomenon has been sug-
gested by the asymptotic structure of the time-dependent com-
ponents of the induced scalar potential in Eq. (26) and the in-
duced vector potential in Eq. (49b). Photon fusion takes place
when two laser photons with the energy ω become a single
photon of frequency 2ω, and this process is otherwise known
as second-order harmonic generation from the vacuum in the
presence of a Coulomb ﬁeld.

The probability of this process can be calculated as follows.
First, it is necessary to calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld at
distances r
1/ω, characteristic of radiation. A straight-
forward calculation leads to the following asymptotics for the
potential Φ(~r, t) and the vector potential ~A(~r, t):

intense laser sources. Note that the result (60) can be also
obtained with the help of the Heisenberg-Euler effective La-
grangian (see, e.g., Ref. [11]). We have checked by explicit
calculation that our result (60) agrees with the alternative
derivation using the Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated, in detail, the properties of the (one-
loop) vacuum-polarization tensor in the presence of two non-
trivial background ﬁelds: (i) the atomic, nuclear Coulomb
ﬁeld, and (ii) a possibly intense laser ﬁeld. The potential in-
duced by the laser-dressed vacuum polarization in a Coulomb
ﬁeld is derived in Sec. II. The approximations employed in
the calculation concern the frequency of the driving laser ω,
which we assume to be small as compared to m c2/~, where
m is the mass of the electron [see Eq. (9)]. This condition is
fulﬁlled by optical wavelengths and for x-rays. Another as-
: our calculation
sumption concerns the laser ﬁeld strength
is valid provided that
E0 is
the critical Schwinger electric ﬁeld, but they remain approx-
imately applicable to situations where, say,
1/10.
Consequently, our calculations remain valid for very intense
laser ﬁelds, but they have to be modiﬁed when the amplitude
of the oscillatory electric ﬁeld is equal or even exceeds the
Schwinger critical electric ﬁeld.

After a derivation of the induced charge density in Sec. II A,
the asymptotics of the laser-induced potential are analyzed in
Sec. II B, both in a region close to the nucleus (r
1/m)
and in a region which includes the Bohr radius (1/m
≪
1/ω). The additional laser-induced potential induces en-
r
ergy shifts to atomic levels which are analyzed in Sec. II C.
We ﬁnd that in addition to a familiar S-state energy shift
[see Eq. (32)], which is present even without a laser ﬁeld,
there is an additional term which is relevant for P states and
states with higher angular momenta, which is generated by
a quadrupole-type contribution to the laser-induced vacuum-
polarization potential [see Eq. (35)]. The latter contribution
generates a “polarized Lamb shift” which is akin to similar
effects predicted in a noncommutative space-time [16].

The analysis of the charge density and the potential in-
duced by the laser-dressed vacuum-polarization is only a part
of the solution of the problem (see Sec. III). The laser ﬁeld
breaks the rotational symmetry of the pure Coulomb potential
and induces, in addition, a nonvanishing current density and
a vector potential (see Sec. III A), which gives rise to addi-
tional ﬁelds, which have both time-independent and oscilla-
tory components. The time-dependent electric and magnetic
components oscillate at the second harmonic of the incident
laser frequency and are analyzed in a region which includes
the Bohr radius of a hydrogenlike system (see Sec. III B). The
time-dependent electric and magnetic components can lead to
electric-dipole transitions via second-order harmonic gener-
ation from the vacuum (see Sec. III C). In the far-ﬁeld, the
induced electric and magnetic ﬁelds correspond to the radia-
tion of real photons, at the second harmonic of the laser (see
E0)4
Sec. III D). This process is suppressed by a factor (

E

and therefore requires excessively large laser ﬁeld strengths
to be experimentally signiﬁcant.

/

Two points are worth mentioning here: (i) all effects de-
rived in the current investigation are suppressed at least by
E0)2. This suppression is
the square of the parameter (
E
directly related to the fact that the virtual particles in the
vacuum-polarization loop are effectively “detached” from the
atomic physics energy scale on which the dominant laser-
dressed radiative effects are commonly expected [6, 7, 8, 9].
This suppression leads to the conclusion that the effects will
be difﬁcult to observe, experimentally, even at the current
high-intensity laser facilities. However, with the advent of
ever more powerful laser facilities which can generate in-
tense pulses, the effects might become within the reach of ex-
perimentalists in the not too distant future. On the basis of
the Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian, the suppression could have
been expected, since the additional terms which supplement
the Maxwell Lagrangian are also suppressed by this factor.
The Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian is intimately related to the
problem studied here (this has been pointed out in Sec. III D).
One point in particular seems worth a note: The “polar-
ized Lamb shift” [16] which is expected in a noncommuta-
tive space-time, ﬁnds a natural counterpart in terms of a laser-
induced effect which is always present when high-precision
spectroscopy experiments are performed [see Eq. (35)]. This
observation puts a severe restraint on the observability of non-
commutative space-time effects in atomic spectroscopy.

In our calculation, we encounter additional ﬁnite renormal-
izations which have to be carried out although the vacuum-
polarization tensor, which forms the starting point of our cal-
culation is in principle already renormalized on mass shell
[see Eqs. (18) and (42)]. The reason is that the additional
external Coulomb ﬁeld induces spurious effects, which have
to be eliminated based on the conservation conditions for the
electric charge and the nonexistence of a magnetic monopole.
The necessity of carrying out additional ﬁnite subtractions is
akin to the additional subtractions that have to be carried out in
the calculation of the Wichmann–Kroll higher-order one-loop
vacuum-polarization corrections in atoms, where, indeed, ad-
ditional subtractions have to be carried out in each order of the
Z α expansion.

Our investigation has been carried out in the more general
context of quantum ﬁeld theory under the inﬂuence of external
(“unusual”) conditions. We have analyzed the vacuum polar-
ization tensor in the presence of a laser ﬁeld and a Coulomb
ﬁeld, which mediate quantum electrodynamic effects under
the inﬂuence of dynamically changing external conditions. A
few curious phenomena are encountered: ﬁnite renormaliza-
tions that apply to the induced charge and current density [see
Eqs. (18) and (42)], induced charge distributions with an un-
usual asymptotic behaviour [see Eqs. (26), (49a) and (49b)],
and the rotational symmetry breaking of the quantum electro-
dynamic effects [see Eq. (35)]. The techniques outlined here
might be useful in other situations where our understanding
In particular, we have shown that general
is more limited.
wisdom regarding the asymptotic structures of the quantum
electrodynamic effects has to be modiﬁed quite drastically in
the presence of further external conditions, like a laser ﬁeld.

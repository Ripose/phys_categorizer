Non-divergent pseudo-potential treatment of spin-polarized fermions under 1D and 3D harmonic
conﬁnement

Atom-atom scattering of bosonic one-dimensional (1D) atoms has been modeled successfully using a zero-
range delta-function potential, while that of bosonic 3D atoms has been modeled successfully using Fermi-
Huang’s regularized s-wave pseudo-potential. Here, we derive the eigenenergies of two spin-polarized 1D
fermions under external harmonic conﬁnement interacting through a zero-range potential, which only acts on
odd-parity wave functions, analytically. We also present a divergent-free zero-range potential treatment of two
spin-polarized 3D fermions under harmonic conﬁnement. Our pseudo-potential treatments are veriﬁed through
numerical calculations for short-range model potentials.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, atom-atom scattering has received renewed in-
terest since the properties of ultracold atomic (bosonic or
fermionic) gases depend predominantly on a single atom-
atom scattering parameter [1]. This is the s-wave scattering
length as for a three-dimensional (3D) Bose gas [2] (or for a
3D Fermi gas consisting of atoms with “spin-up” and “spin-
down”), and the p-wave scattering volume Vp [3, 4] for a 3D
spin-polarized Fermi gas. For a 1D or quasi-1D gas, it is
the 1D scattering length a1D [5, 6], which characterizes the
even-parity and odd-parity spatial wave function applicable to
bosons and to spin-polarized fermions, respectively. In many
instances, atom-atom scattering processes can be conveniently
modeled through a shape-independent pseudo-potential [7, 8],
whose coupling strength is chosen such that it reproduces the
scattering properties of the full shape-dependent 3D or 1D
atom-atom potential.

Fermi-Huang’s regularized pseudo-potential [9, 10, 11]
supports a single bound state for positive as and no bound
state for negative as. It has been used frequently to describe
3D s-wave scattering between two bosons or two fermions
with different generalized spin. Busch et al. [12], e.g., de-
rive the eigenenergies for two atoms under harmonic con-
ﬁnement interacting through Fermi Huang’s pseudo-potential
analytically. Using an energy-dependent scattering length
as(E), their results can be applied successfully to situations
where as is large and positive, i.e., near a Feshbach reso-
nance [13, 14, 15]. Building on these results, Borca et al. [16]
use a simple two-atom model to explain many aspects of
an experiment that produces molecules from a sea of cold
atoms using magnetic ﬁeld ramps [17]. In addition to these
two-body applications, Fermi-Huang’s 3D s-wave pseudo-
potential plays a key role in developing (effective) many-body
theories.

This paper determines the eigenspectrum of two spin-
polarized 3D fermions interacting through a regularized p-
wave zero-range potential, parameterized through a single pa-
rameter, i.e., the p-wave scattering volume Vp, under har-
monic conﬁnement analytically. Since wave functions with
relative angular momentum l greater than zero have vanishing
amplitude at r = 0 (where r denotes the distance between the

two atoms), our zero-range p-wave potential contains deriva-
tive operators. Furthermore, it contains, following ideas sug-
gested by Huang and Yang in 1957 [11], a so-called regular-
ization operator, which eliminates divergencies at r = 0 that
would arise otherwise. We show that our pseudo-potential
imposes a boundary condition on the wave function at r = 0
(see also Ref. [18]); this boundary condition serves as an al-
ternative representation of the p-wave pseudo-potential. Ear-
lier studies, in contrast, impose a boundary condition at ﬁnite
r, corresponding to a ﬁnite-range pseudo-potential with two
parameters [19, 20]. The validity of our pseudo-potential is
demonstrated by comparing the eigenenergies determined an-
alytically for two particles under harmonic conﬁnement with
those determined numerically for shape-dependent atom-atom
potentials.

Due to signiﬁcant advancements in trapping and cool-
ing, to date cold atomic gases cannot only be trapped in
3D geometries but also in quasi-2D and quasi-1D geome-
tries [21, 22, 23]. In the quasi-1D regime, the transverse mo-
tion is “frozen out” so that the behaviors of atomic gases are
dominated by the longitudinal motion. Quasi-1D gases can
hence often be treated within a 1D model, where the atoms
are restricted to a line. To model 1D atom-atom interac-
tions, for which the spatial wave function has even parity,
delta-function contact interactions have been used success-
fully. In contrast to the 3D s-wave delta-function potential,
which requires a regularization, the 1D delta-function pseudo-
potential is non-divergent [24]. To treat spin-polarized 1D
fermions, a pseudo-potential that acts on spatial wave func-
tions with odd parity is needed. Here, we use such a pseudo-
potential to determine the eigenenergies of two spin-polarized
1D fermions under harmonic conﬁnement analytically. Com-
parison with eigenenergies determined numerically for shape-
dependent 1D atom-atom potentials illustrates the applicabil-
ity of our 1D pseudo-potential. Our results conﬁrm the Fermi-
Bose duality [25, 26, 27, 28, 29] in 1D for two atoms under
harmonic conﬁnement.

B. Analytical pseudo-potential treatment: Odd parity

Following the derivation of the even-parity eigenenergies
by Busch et al. [12], we now derive an analogous expres-
sion for the odd-parity eigenenergies E −1D using the zero-range
pseudo-potential V −pseudo(z),

with continuous derivatives at z = 0. We show that the loga-
rithmic derivative of y −1D(z) is well-behaved for z
0+. In
Eq. (10), the ﬁrst derivative acts to the left and the second to

Since V −pseudo(z) acts only on wave functions with odd par-
ity (and not on those with even parity), we refer to V −pseudo(z)
as odd-parity pseudo-potential; however, V −pseudo(z) itself has
even parity. Similar pseudo-potentials have recently also been
used by others [28, 29, 30].

To start with, we expand the discontinuous odd-parity

C. Comparison with shape-dependent 1D atom-atom potential

To benchmark the applicability of the odd-parity pseudo-

ﬁnement, we solve the 1D Schrödinger equation, Eq. (2), for
the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (3) numerically for the shape-

parameters roughly approximate the 3D Rb2 triplet poten-
tial [32]. The angular trapping frequency w
z is ﬁxed at
z), and the atom mass m at that of the 87Rb
10−
atom, implying an oscillator length az of 112.5a.u., and hence
a fairly tightly trapped atom pair. To investigate potentials
with different 1D scattering properties, we choose depth pa-
rameters d for which the 1D Morse potential supports between
zero and two 1D odd-parity bound states. Solid lines in Fig. 2
show the resulting 1D odd-parity eigenenergies E −1D obtained
numerically as a function of d. The corresponding eigenstates
have “gas-like character”, that is, these states would corre-
spond to continuum states if the conﬁning potential was ab-
sent.

To compare the odd-parity eigenenergies obtained numer-
ically for the Morse potential Vmorse(z) with those obtained
for the odd-parity pseudo-potential V −pseudo(z), we follow
Refs. [14, 15]. We ﬁrst perform scattering calculations for
the 1D Morse potential (no conﬁnement) as a function of the
relative scattering energy Esc for various depths d, which pro-
vide, for a given d, the energy-dependent 1D scattering length
tan(d −1D(k))/k. Using the rela-
a−1D(Esc), where a−1D(Esc) =
−
tion between the 1D scattering length a−1D and the 1D coupling
strength g−1D, Eq. (27), we then solve the transcendental equa-
tion (25) self-consistently for E −1D.

Diamonds in Fig. 2 show the resulting odd-parity eigenen-
ergies E −1D for two 1D particles under harmonic conﬁnement
interacting through the odd-parity energy-dependent pseudo-
potential V −pseudo(z) with g−1D = g−1D(Esc). Excellent agree-
ment between these eigenenergies and those obtained for the
Morse potential (solid lines) is visible for all well depths d.
We emphasize that this agreement depends crucially on the
usage of energy-dependent 1D coupling constants. In sum-
mary, Fig. 2 illustrates that the odd-parity pseudo-potential
V −pseudo(z) provides a good description of the eigenstates of
two spin-polarized 1D fermions under harmonic conﬁnement
for all interaction strengths, including g−1D → ±

Since only s-wave wave functions have a non-vanishing
amplitude at r = 0, Fermi-Huang’s regularized pseudo-
potential leads exclusively to s-wave scattering (no other par-
tial waves are scattered). Equation (38) hence applies to two
ultracold bosons under external conﬁnement, for which higher
even partial waves, such as d- or g-waves, are negligible.

Pseudo-potentials of the form g1←(cid:209) ~rd (3)(~r)(cid:209) ~r→ have been
used by a number of researchers before [34, 35, 36, 37]; dis-
crepancies regarding the proper value of the coefﬁcient g1,
however, exist (see, e.g., Ref. [36]). Here, we introduce the
regularization operator 1
¶ r2 r2 [Eq. (41)], which eliminates

divergencies that would arise otherwise from the irregular p-
2). A similar regular-
wave solution (which diverges as r−
ization operator has been proposed by Huang and Yang in
1957 [11]; they, however, use it in conjunction with a cou-
pling parameter g1 different from that given by Eq. (42).
By comparing with numerical results for a shape-dependent
model potential, we show that the pseudo-potential V l=1
pseudo(~r)
describes the scattering behaviors of two spin-aligned 3D
fermions properly (see Sec. III C).

cellent agreement between these eigenenergies and those ob-
tained for the Morse potential (solid lines) is visible for all

crucially on the usage of energy-dependent 3D scattering vol-
umes. Figure 4 illustrates that the p-wave pseudo-potential

IV. SUMMARY

We determined the eigenspectrum for two 1D particles un-
der harmonic conﬁnement interacting through a momentum-
dependent zero-range potential. This pseudo-potential acts
only on states with odd-parity, and is hence applicable to
the scattering between two spin-polarized 1D fermions. We
showed that a basis set expansion in continuous functions
can be used to determine the eigenenergies and discontinu-
ous eigenfunctions of two 1D particles under harmonic con-
ﬁnement interacting through the odd-parity pseudo-potential
V −pseudo(z). Our divergence-free treatment conﬁrms the Fermi-
Bose duality in 1D for two particles.

We also determined an implicit expression for the eigenen-
ergies E3D, Eq. (65), and eigenfunctions y 3D(~r), Eq. (67),
of two spin-polarized 3D fermions under harmonic conﬁne-
ment interacting through a momentum-dependent zero-range

C. Comparison with shape-dependent 3D atom-atom potential

To benchmark our p-wave pseudo-potential treatment of
two spin-polarized 3D fermions under harmonic conﬁnement,
we solve the 3D Schrödinger equation, Eq. (35), for the
Hamiltonian given by Eq. (33) numerically for the shape-
dependent Morse potential Vmorse(r), Eq. (31) with z replaced
by r and z0 replaced by r0. As in Sec. II C, our numerical
calculations are performed for r0 = 11.65a.u., a = 0.35a.u.,
ho = w ho), and m = m(87Rb). The well
w ho = 10−
depth d is chosen such that the 3D Morse potential supports
between zero and two l = 1 bound states. Solid lines in Fig. 4
show the resulting 3D eigenenergies E3D with l = 1 obtained
numerically as a function of the depth d.

9a.u. (2p

To compare the l = 1 eigenenergies obtained numerically
for the Morse potential Vmorse(r) with those obtained for the
p-wave pseudo-potential V l=1
pseudo(~r), we follow the procedure
outlined in Sec. II C, that is, we ﬁrst determine the energy-

¥
¥
n
potential. Similar to studies of two atoms with l = 0 [13, 14,
15, 16], our analytical expressions might be useful in under-
standing the behavior of two conﬁned spin-aligned fermions,
including physics near Feshbach resonances. The p-wave
pseudo-potential used in our study contains derivative oper-
ators as well as a regularization operator; the former is needed
to construct a true zero-range potential (since l = 1 solutions
go to zero as r approaches zero, see above) while the latter is
needed to eliminate divergencies of the irregular p-wave solu-
2). We showed that our zero-range
tion (which diverges as r−
potential V l=1
pseudo(~r) imposes a boundary condition at r = 0,
Eq. (68), which depends on a single atomic physics parame-
ter, that is, the scattering volume Vp. This boundary condition
is an alternative representation of V l=1

pseudo(~r).

Similarly to Fermi-Huang’s regularized s-wave pseudo-
potential, the p-wave pseudo-potential used here might ﬁnd

9

applications in developing effective many-body theories for
ultracold spin-polarized Fermi gases. Such theories will have
to carefully investigate how to implement renormalization
procedures needed in numerical calculations.

Note added: After submission of this paper we became
aware of a related study by Stock et al., see quant-ph/0405153,
which derives Eq. (65) starting with a pseudo-potential ex-
pressed as the limit of a d -shell.

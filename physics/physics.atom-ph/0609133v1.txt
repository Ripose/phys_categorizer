This review describes the production of atomic strontium samples at ultra-low tem-
perature and at high phase-space density, and their possible use for physical studies and
applications. We describe the process of loading a magneto-optical trap from an atomic
beam and preparing the sample for high precision measurements. Particular emphasis
is given to the applications of ultracold Sr samples, spanning from optical frequency
metrology to force sensing at micrometer scale.

1. Introduction

Recently, laser-cooled atomic strontium has been the subject of active research
in several ﬁelds spanning from all-optical cooling towards quantum degeneracy
for bosonic,1,2 and fermionic3 isotopes, cooling physics,4,5 continuous atom laser,6
detection of ultra-narrow transitions,7,8,9,10 multiple scattering,11 and collisional
theory12.

Much of that interest relies on the features of the electronic level structure
of alkali-earth atoms, that make them ideal systems for laser manipulation and
for the realization of quantum devices. Among the alkali-earth metals, strontium
summarizes most of the useful properties both for the preparation of ultracold
samples and for applications.

The ground-state Sr atom presents a strong and quasi-closed optical transition
well suited for eﬃcient trapping in magneto-optical traps (MOT’s) from thermal
samples,13,14 and a multiplet of weak intercombination transitions with large inter-
est in laser cooling and optical metrology. All of these transitions are easily accessi-
ble with compact solid-state laser sources, as described in Appendix A. Second-stage
cooling on the narrow 1S0-3P1 intercombination line was proven to be an eﬃcient
method to reduce the sample temperature down to the photon recoil limit.1

The absence of a nuclear spin in all of the bosonic isotopes greatly simpliﬁes the
electronic energy spectrum with respect to the already simple structure of alkali
atoms, and allows a direct veriﬁcation of theories in the ﬁeld of light scattering15
and laser cooling.5 Moreover, the lack of nuclear spin results in minimum sensi-
tivity to stray magnetic ﬁelds: this has important consequences on high-precision
measurements, as discussed in sections 6 and 7.

Interatomic collisions may represent an important source of perturbations in
atomic quantum devices. In this respect, the 88Sr atom exhibits excellent features
due to its remarkably small collisional cross-section, resulting in the longest coher-
ence time for Bloch oscillations observed so far.16

As a consequence of their zero magnetic moment, ground-state bosonic Sr iso-
topes cannot be magnetically trapped. However, optical dipole trapping with far-oﬀ
resonant laser ﬁelds provides an eﬀective method for trapping in conservative poten-
tials. By properly choosing the wavelength of the trapping laser ﬁeld, it is possible
to design optical potentials that shift equally levels belonging to the singlet and
triplet manifolds, hence avoiding perturbations to a given intercombination line.17
This feature is the basis of laser cooling in dipole traps and allows one to reach a
temperature close to the recoil limit with a phase-space density close to quantum
degeneracy both with bosonic and fermionic isotopes.18,3,2

Several groups are presently working on laser cooled strontium. The Tokyo group
ﬁrst demonstrated the double-stage optical cooling down to sub-µK temperatures;1
they also proposed and realized a Sr “optical lattice clock”,19 and made pioneering
studies on electric microtraps for strontium.20 The JILA group has made interest-
ing studies on cooling physics,4,5 and on metrological applications.10 Our group
is concerned both with ultracold physics studies,2 and with applications to opti-
cal metrology9 and quantum devices.16 The BNM-SYRTE group is mainly con-
cerned with metrological applications,8,21,22 the Houston group with ultracold Sr
physics,23,24 while the Nice group has studied multiple scattering of light from cold
Sr samples,15 and analyzed several details of the Sr cooling mechanisms.25

From the experimental point of view, some of the techniques and solutions
involved in atomic strontium cooling are speciﬁc to this atom and to some extent
uncommon in the ﬁeld of atomic physics and laser cooling. In this paper we give a
detailed description of how to prepare an ultra-cold strontium sample which is well
suited for high-precision spectroscopy, the study of quantum degenerate gases and
quantum sensors. The presentation has the following structure:

section 2 summarizes the properties of the strontium atom,
section 3 describes the process of laser cooling of strontium starting from
the slowing of a thermal beam, to the cooling down to the photon recoil
limit and trapping in a conservative potential,

bosonic Sr isotopes,

in section 6 we present the use of ultracold Sr atoms as force sensors at
micrometric scale,
in section 7 we review the recent frequency measurements on the Sr inter-
combination transitions with application to optical metrology,
in Appendix A we give a detailed description of the experimental setup
employed in laser cooling of strontium, namely the vacuum apparatus and
the laser sources.

2. Properties of the strontium atom

The main properties of atomic strontium are common to almost all alkaline-earth
metals. At ambient temperature it appears as a metal. Its vapor pressure is quite
low, and it reaches 1 mTorr at 1000 Kelvin. The Sr atom is rather reactive: it forms
compounds with oxygen, nitrogen, water and silicates, while it is inert against sap-
phire. Thus in working with Sr vapors it is common to employ sapphire windows.26
Strontium has four natural isotopes, whose properties are listed in tab. 1. The
bosonic (even) isotopes have zero nuclear spin, thus they are perfect scalar particles
in the J = 0 states. This has important consequences for applications to optical
metrology and quantum sensors (see sections 6 and 7).

Concerning the electronic level structure, due to the presence of two electrons
in the outer shell the atomic states can be grouped into two separate classes: sin-
glets and triplets. Since the spin-orbit interaction breaks the spin symmetry, inter-
combination transitions between singlet and triplet states are weakly allowed.27 A
simpliﬁed scheme of relevant Sr levels and transitions is shown in ﬁgure 1.

The strong 1S0-1P1 transition at 461 nm has a natural width of 32 MHz, and it is
used for laser cooling and trapping.13,14 Such transition is not perfectly closed, due
10−5). The direct
to a small leakage towards the 4d 1D2 state (branching ratio
1D2-1S0 decay channel is forbidden in dipole approximation, and atoms from the
1D2 basically decay towards the 5p 3P2 (branching ratio 33 %) and 5p 3P1 (branch-
ing ratio 67 %) states.

∼

The line strength of the three 5s2 1S-5s5p 3P intercombination transitions range
from the relatively high value (7.6 kHz) of the 689 nm 1S0-3P1 line to the virtually
zero value of the 1S0-1P0 line for the even isotopes in the absence of external ﬁelds.
In 87Sr the 0-0 line has a natural linewidth of

1 mHz due to hyperﬁne mixing.

and optical manipulation are indicated as well as their linewidths.

3. Laser cooling and trapping

A magneto-optical trap operated on the 1S0-1P1 line requires the use of a blue laser
source, that can be realized through second-harmonic generation from a semicon-
ductor laser, as described in section A.2.

The ﬁnal temperature in such a “blue MOT” is limited to few mK by the
linewidth of the 1S0-1P1 transition: the ground state of alkaline-earth even iso-
topes has no hyperﬁne or Zeeman structure, and this prevents the application of
sub-Doppler cooling techniques. However, the presence of narrow intercombination
transitions allows eﬃcient second-stage Doppler cooling down to sub-recoil temper-
atures, as described in 3.4. In 87Sr, the ground-state hyperﬁne structure oﬀers the
chance for sub-Doppler cooling on the 1S0-1P1 transition, as demonstrated by the
JILA group.4 Alternatively, it is possible to apply sub-Doppler cooling techniques
to atoms trapped in the metastable 3P2 level, as already demonstrated on Ca.28

In this section we illustrate the Sr cooling and trapping in detail, as performed
in our laboratory. We start by preparing a mK sample in the blue MOT from
a Zeeman-slowed atomic beam, using optical pumping to recycle atoms from the
metastable 3P2 level. Then we transfer the atoms to a “red MOT” operated on the
1S0-3P1 intercombination line, where we cool them down to µK temperatures. Our
apparatus allows us to trap diﬀerent Sr isotopes simultaneously, as described in 3.5.
The ﬁnal step consists in loading an optical dipole trap.

3.1. Zeeman slowing and atomic beam collimation

The sequence for cooling and trapping on the 461 nm resonance line follows standard
techniques, as already reported by other groups.1,4,14,29 We slow the thermal atomic
beam to few tens of m/s in a 30-cm long Zeeman-slower30 based on a two-stages

tapered coil with a zero crossing magnetic ﬁeld, and a counter-propagating laser
beam frequency shifted by 480 MHz to the red of the 1S0-1P1 transition. The beam,
with typical power of 40 mW, has a 7 mm 1/e2 radius at the MOT and it is focused
on the capillaries (see appendix A.1). The distance between the capillaries and the
MOT region is 100 cm.

The atomic beam brightness can be increased with a 2-D transverse cooling
stage before the Zeeman slower.31,32 This improves the MOT loading both by in-
creasing the atomic ﬂux coupled into the diﬀerential pumping tube (see A.1), and
by eﬀectively reducing the ﬁnal diameter of the atomic beam after the Zeeman
slower.

We implement a 2D optical molasses with two 461 nm beams sent perpendic-
ularly to the atomic beam, in multipass geometry on two orthogonal planes. The
beams are red detuned by 20 MHz with respect to the 1S0-1P1 resonance. At given
optical power, the multi-pass geometry improves the transverse cooling eﬃciency by
increasing the length of the interaction region. In the present setup we use beams
with 1/e2 diameter of 2.5 mm2 bouncing about 12 times to cover an interaction
length of 4 cm. The interaction starts 15 cm after the capillaries (see A.1). In that
region the beam diameter has already reached about 11 mm.

Without beam collimation we can couple into the diﬀerential pumping tube
(placed 24 cm far from collimation region) about 10 % of the total atomic ﬂux. With
the 2D molasses we increase the coupling by a factor of 4 in optimal conditions (laser
detuning
20 mW). This simple scheme can also be used
to deﬂect the atomic beam.

3.2. Blue MOT

The slowed atoms are then cooled and trapped in a MOT operated on the 1S0-
1P1 transition 40 MHz to the red with respect to resonance. Three retro-reﬂected
beams with a 5 mm 1/e2 radius cross in the MOT region with almost mutually
orthogonal directions. The vertical beam is collinear with the magnetic quadrupole
axis of an anti-Helmholz pair of coils. The ﬁeld gradient at the quadrupole cen-
ter is 50 Gauss/cm. Taking into account the coupling eﬃciency of the blue laser
source into the ﬁber (70 %) and the eﬃciency of the AOMs (75
80 %), the re-
maining 120 mW are split into the three channels: typical power values are respec-
tively 60 mW for MOT beams, 40 mW for Zeeman slower and 20 mW for transverse
cooling beams. The total 461 nm light incident on the MOT region amounts to

∼

90 mW/cm2.
We have a rough estimate of the number of trapped atoms by collecting the
461 nm ﬂuorescence on a calibrated photodiode. By changing the blue laser detuning
we are able to separately trap the four natural Sr isotopes, as shown in ﬁgure 2. For
a more accurate measure of the atom number we perform absorption imaging on
a CCD with a resonant 461 nm horizontally propagating probe beam. We measure
the sample temperature with standard time-of-ﬂight technique.

the diﬀerent isotopes are visible.

The lowest temperatures measured in the blue MOT are typically higher than
the Doppler limit by at least a factor two. The Nice group has shown that the
extra-heating mechanisms causing such discrepancy can be explained in terms of
intensity ﬂuctuations in the MOT laser beams.25

3.3. Optical repumping from metastable states

The 1S0-1P1 transition used in the ﬁrst stages of cooling and trapping is not per-
fectly closed due to the decay channel of the 5s5p 1P1 towards the 5s4d 1D2 state,
10−5. Atoms in the latter state may decay back to
that has a branching ratio of 2
the ground state trough the 5s5p 3P1 within less than 1 ms, or may decay to the
metastable 5s5p 3P2 and be lost (see ﬁgure 1). Under typical MOT conditions this
process limits the MOT lifetime to few tens of milliseconds.

×

Some groups already circumvented this limitation by optical pumping atoms
from the metastable 5s5p 3P2 to the ground state via the 5s6s 3S1 state with 707 nm
light.33 Since the 5s6s 3S1 state is also coupled to the metastable 5s5p 3P0 an ad-
ditional laser at 679 nm is necessary in this scheme. To reduce the number of
repumping lasers we use a diﬀerent approach which involves the 5s5d 3D2 state and
requires one single laser at 497 nm. Concerning the optical pumping, the 3D2 state
is coupled basically to the 3P2 and 3P1 states, then eﬃcient pumping is insured
within few absorption cycles. To this purpose during the loading we illuminate the
blue MOT with light at 497 nm, produced by the source described in section A.2,
which is kept on resonance with the repumping transition. Figure 3 shows the eﬀect
of the repumping ﬁeld on the 88Sr MOT loading in diﬀerent conditions. Without
the repumper the MOT loading time (1/e) is 10.2 ms regardless to the presence of
the atomic beam transverse cooling, and correspondingly to the ﬂux of atoms cap-
tured. In presence of the repumper we observe a 0.24 s lifetime when few atoms are

This reduction in lifetime is explained in terms of light assisted collision.33

Due to the diﬀerence in the natural isotope abundance (see section 2), the
loading ﬂux into the MOT varies correspondingly. In typical conditions, i.e. when
operating with the transverse cooling and optical repumping from the metastable
state, and with the Sr oven kept at
700 K, the steady-state blue MOT population
amounts to

3.4. Red MOT

The Tokyo group ﬁrst realized a strontium MOT operated on the 1S0-3P1 line.1
Such system has been exhaustively studied by the JILA group, both theoretically
and experimentally.5 The dynamics of laser cooling on narrow transitions presents
several interesting features. Unlike in the case of ordinary magneto-optical traps,
for the 1S0-3P1 transition in alkaline-earth atoms the natural linewidth Γ is of
the order of the recoil frequency shift ΓR. In such conditions both mechanical and
thermodynamical MOT properties cannot be explained by the ordinary semiclassi-
cal Doppler theory of laser cooling. In particular, the role of gravity becomes non

Isat , the atoms interact with the MOT laser beams only on a

and the minimal attainable temperature is TR
2 .5 Figure 4 shows the dependence of
the MOT temperature on the 689 nm laser intensity, as measured in our laboratory.
The JILA group also studied the case of positive laser detuning, revealing the
appearance of novel striking phenomena such as momentum-space crystals. They
showed that driving the atomic system with 689 nm light blue detuned from the 1S0-
3P1 resonance may result in a periodic pattern in the atomic velocity distribution.5
Second-stage cooling of the odd Sr isotope is more complex, due to the hyperﬁne
structure of both ground and excited states. The Tokyo group has shown that
using two lasers at 689 nm it is possible to cool and trap 87Sr atoms at phase-space
densities close to the Fermi degeneracy.34

We here illustrate the red MOT for bosonic Sr isotopes as realized in our labo-
ratory. The 689 nm light for the MOT beam (14 mW) is provided by a slave laser
injection-locked with light coming from the stable master laser described in A.3.
The beam spot is then enlarged to the same radius as the 461 nm MOT beams and
overlapped to the blue beams with a dichroic mirror. After that mirror, the two
wavelengths share the same broad-band optics: polarizing beam splitters, mirrors
and waveplates.

The linewidth of the intercombination transition is not suﬃcient to cover
the Doppler broadening corresponding to the velocity distribution of the sample
trapped in the blue MOT. An eﬃcient solution consists in broadening the spectrum
of the 689 nm laser ﬁeld.1 On the contrary, groups working on other alkaline-earth
atoms (i.e. Ca and Mg) employ a resonant coupling to some higher level to quench
the 3P1 lifetime,35 thus increasing the eﬀective strength of the intercombination
transition, as the maximum radiation force would be otherwise lower than gravity.
We add a frequency modulation at 50 kHz in the ﬁrst 200 ms. The total frequency
span is 2 MHz, corresponding to 40 sidebands, with an intensity of 120 µW/cm2 per
sideband (the saturation intensity is Isat = 3 µW/cm2). The central frequency is
red detuned by 1 MHz with respect to resonance. At the end of the FM recapture,
we normally obtain a cloud at a temperature of about 20 µK. After that we remove
the frequency modulation, set a ﬁxed red detuning from 1S0-3P1 transition and
reduce the beam intensity in the last 60 ms of cooling. Working at 350 kHz below
resonance and reducing the total light intensity on the MOT to 70 µW/cm2, we
can then transfer about 10 % of the atoms from the blue MOT to the red MOT at
temperatures below 1 µK.

3.5. Cooling and trapping isotopic mixtures

Among the experiments on ultracold atoms, much work is being concentrated on the
study of mixtures of diﬀerent atomic species36,37,38 or diﬀerent isotopes of the same
species.39,40,41,42 Mixtures oﬀer a way to exploit collisional physics not applicable
in single species samples.43 They also oﬀer additional degrees of freedom, such as
sympathetic cooling, in order to achieve the degenerate quantum regime with atoms
for which evaporative cooling is not eﬃcient.44

For simultaneous trapping of diﬀerent isotopes previous experiments employed
laser sources delivering the necessary frequency components for each isotope
involved.45,39 In the case of the strontium blue MOT, this approach may be diﬃ-
cult to apply because of the complexity of the laser sources and the limited laser
power. An alterative solution is presented by the use of the magnetically trapped
3P2 state as a dark atom reservoir.46,47,48 During the blue MOT phase without the
repumper, the small loss channel of the excited 1P1 state towards the metastable
3P2 state provides a continuous loading of atoms into the potential given by the
MOT’s magnetic quadrupole. Figure 5 reports our lifetime measurements on the
magnetically trapped metastable isotopes. By using the same blue laser source, one
can sequentially load diﬀerent isotopes into the magnetic potential by just stepping
the laser frequency to the diﬀerent resonances.

We typically start by collecting one isotope (say 86Sr) for a few seconds, then we
tune the blue laser on resonance to the other isotope (say 88Sr). Once the isotopic
mixture is prepared in the 3P2 state, the blue light is switched oﬀ, and the FM
red MOT is switched on as well as the repumping beam. The isotopic shift on the

repumping transition is smaller than the resonance width of the 3P2-3D2 transition
observed on the blue MOT ﬂuorescence, which results in eﬃcient, simultaneous
optical pumping of 88Sr and 86Sr on a time scale short with respect to the red
MOT capture time. The loading of a single isotope into the magnetic potential was
already described by Nagel et al.,47 and we did not observe signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the behavior when loading two isotopes. Figure 5 shows the measurement of the
lifetime for each isotope, both when individually trapped and in the presence of the
blue MOT working on the other isotope. The measured lifetime values are all of
the order of 5 s, close to the background pressure limited lifetime of 7 s.

The laser source for the operation of the two-isotope red MOT is composed of
two slave lasers injected from the same frequency stabilized master with a frequency
oﬀset corresponding to the isotopic shift of 163 817.3 kHz.9 Subsequently, the fre-
quency and intensity of the two beams are controlled by double pass AOMs driven
by the same RF, the beams are superimposed on a polarizing beam splitter, and
then they are overlapped to the blue MOT beams as described previously. Com-
paring the two-isotope red MOT with the single isotope one, with the same atom
numbers we do not observe any eﬀect in the transfer eﬃciency and ﬁnal tempera-
ture due to the presence of the second isotope. In this way, we obtain samples with
up to 107 (106) atoms of 88Sr (86Sr) at a temperature 2 µK (1 µK). We attribute
the diﬀerence in the loading to the natural abundances and to minor diﬀerences in
the red MOT parameters. By varying the order of loading and the loading times of
the two isotopes we can vary almost arbitrarily the ﬁnal ratio of populations.

The atom number and temperature are measured independently on the two

contribution of the non-resonant isotope is taken into account.

3.6. Optical dipole trap

In magneto-optical traps the atomic temperature and lifetime are fundamentally
limited by resonant photon scattering and light-assisted collisions. In all exper-
iments requiring long storage times or ultra-low temperatures, it is convenient
to transfer the atoms into a conservative trap. The ground-state even isotopes of
alkaline-earth atoms cannot be magnetically trapped, due to the absence of Zee-
man structure. Though the Tokyo group has recently demostrated a clever scheme
for Sr trapping with AC elecric ﬁelds,20 in most cases the best choice consists in
optical dipole traps. Moreover on two-electrons atoms it is possible to apply light-
shift cancellation techniques to the intercombination transitions,17 opening the way
to optical spectroscopy with ultimate accuracy. However, the optical dipole trap
is widely employed with magnetic atoms as well,49 since it generally produces a
stronger conﬁnement than magnetic traps, up to the Lamb-Dicke regime in optical
lattices,50 and permits trapping in all the magnetic sub-levels.

In an optical dipole trap the conﬁning force originates from the energy level
gradient produced by the intensity-dependent light shift. The energy level shift ∆E
of an atom in an optical ﬁeld is proportional to the light intensity I and, in the
rotating-wave approximation, inversely proportional to the frequency detuning δ
from resonance:

where Γ and Isat are the linewidth and the saturation intensity of the resonance
transition, respectively, while the photon scattering rate RS scales as the light
intensity and the inverse square of the laser detuning:

∆E =

~Γ2I
8δIsat

,

RS =

Γ3I
4δ2Isat

.

(2)

(3)

Thus, at a given trap potential depth, it is possible to reduce the heating due to
photon scattering by increasing δ and I proportionally. In far-oﬀ resonant optical
dipole traps (FORT) the eﬀect of photon scattering is negligible for most practical
purposes.

The trapping radiation couples singlet and triplet states independently. This
results in a diﬀerent dependence on the trapping wavelength for the light shift of the
1S0 and 3P1 levels, so that the diﬀerential shift vanishes at a “magic wavelength”.
This enables optical cooling into the dipole trap, since the detuning of the cooling
radiation is not position-dependent.

For our optical dipole trap we employ the apparatus described in appendix A.4.
In most cases we use the horizontally propagating beam alone. This single-beam
FORT has a trap depth of 90 µK. The computed radial and axial trap frequencies

The transfer eﬃciency from the red MOT to the FORT results from a balance
between loading ﬂux and density dependent losses due to light assisted collisions.17
Figure 6 shows typical loading curves, together with an in-situ image of the trapped
atoms.

The AC Stark shift of the intercombination line depends on the direction of the
FORT ﬁeld with respect to the bias magnetic ﬁeld ~B. We use the MOT quadrupole
ﬁeld to resolve the Zeeman structure of the 1S0-3P1 line, and we keep the polariza-
tion of the FORT beam linear and orthogonal to ~B. In such conditions the resulting
light shift is not critical for laser cooling in the FORT. The wavelength used for
the dipole trap is only 7 nm away from the “magic wavelength” for the intercombi-
nation 1S0-3P1 transition.51 When the polarization of the dipole trapping light is
orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld the Stark shift for the 1S0-3P1 transition is lower
than 10 kHz. Thus, it is possible to cool the atoms while loading the dipole trap.18

4. Collisional studies on ground-state even Sr isotopes

The study of atomic collisions at low temperature has undergone a rapid devel-
opment in recent years following the advent of a number of cooling techniques for
diluite atomic gases. The measurement of collisional parameters gives insight into
an interesting and promising physics, allowing tests of theoretical models for inter-
atomic potentials and molecular wavefunctions.33,52 Moreover, a precise knowledge

of collisional properties is essential for experiments aiming to explore regimes of
quantum degeneracy in atomic gases.53,54

Here we describe a systematic analysis on the ground-state collisional properties
of the two most abundant bosonic Sr isotopes (88Sr and 86Sr) performed with our
apparatus. More speciﬁcally, we evaluated the elastic cross-sections σi−j (i, j =
86, 88) for both intra and inter-species collisions, and the three-body recombination
coeﬃcients Ki (i = 86, 88) in the FORT. The elastic cross-sections were deduced
by driving the system out of thermal equilibrium and measuring the thermalization
rate together with the sample density. For the inelastic collisions, we measured
the density dependence of the trap loss rate. The key point of our experimental
procedure is a precise knowledge of the atomic density. This in turn requires a
proper control of the trap frequencies. We assumed the equilibrium phase-space
distribution in an ideal harmonic trap to infer the atomic density from the measured
number of atoms N and temperature T . Our assumption is supported by the fact
that the ratio η = U
kB T of trap depth and sample temperature was larger than 5 in
all of our measurements. The equilibrium peak atomic density in a harmonic trap
is

where ¯ν is the average trap frequency, m is the atomic mass and kB is the Boltzmann
constant. Our results show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the collisional properties of the
two isotopes. Both the elastic cross-section and the three-body collision coeﬃcient
were found to be several orders of magnitude larger in 86Sr than in 88Sr, and the
inter-species cross-section σ86−88 is much larger than the intra-species cross-section
σ88−88.

We adopted the standard technique of observing the cross-thermalization be-
tween orthogonal degrees of freedom.55,56,57,58 The single-beam FORT geometry
is not well suited for this experiment, as the temperature in the horizontal modes
cannot be univocally determined with our apparatus, and because with 86Sr in
our experimental conditions the system turned out to be in hydrodinamic regime
along the axial direction.59,60 Given these constraints, we chose the crossed-beams
geometry for the thermalization measurements.

In order to drive the system out of thermal equilibrium we performed a selective
optical cooling along the vertical direction with resonant 689 nm light. For this
purpose we took advantage of the fact that the FORT is located at the center of
the red MOT, where atoms are not resonant with the horizontal MOT beams.5
We chose the optical intensity and cooling time in such way to create a detectable
thermal anisotropy without introducing dramatic losses.

We measured the intra-species thermalization rate τth by separately loading one
isotope (either 88Sr or 86Sr) and observing the temporal evolution towards thermal
equilibrium (see ﬁgure 7). In both cases the total trap loss rate was much lower
than the thermalization rate, so the atom number was constant within shot-to-shot

We repeated our measurements for diﬀerent values of the atom density, in order

or ergodic mixing between diﬀerent degrees of freedom. The resulting values are

σ88−88 = 3(1)

both density and temperature instabilities. Such results might be compared with
the zero-temperature cross sections deduced from scattering length values through
the relation σ = 8πλ2, where λ is the s-wave scattering length. Scattering length
values were obtained from photoassociation spectra by the Tokyo group for 88Sr,62
and by the Houston group for both isotopes.24 As concerning σ88−88, our value is
consistent with the Tokyo work, while the Houston group predicts an even smaller
cross-section. On the contrary, there is a fair agreement between our σ86−86 value
and the Houston work. All of these results are summarized in tab. 2

We studied the inelastic collisions by loading a single isotope in the single-
beam FORT (either 88Sr or 86Sr) and looking at the evolution of the number and
temperature of trapped atoms in the FORT after the MOT operation was ﬁnished.
We found no evidence for non-exponential decay with 88Sr. The measured lifetime
of 7 s is consistent with the residual background gas pressure of 10−8 torr. With the

initial atom density at trap center of 3

5. Towards a BEC of strontium

Laser cooling is a very eﬀective technique to reach phase-space densities within
few orders of magnitude from quantum degeneracy. The limits in cooling at high
density are set by the optical depth of the sample, i.e. reabsorption of scattered light,
and light-assisted atom-atom collisions. Forced evaporative cooling represents the

common way to circumvent these limits.68 However, this procedure is not eﬀective
with all atoms. In particular, among the atoms cooled with optical methods, none of
the alkali-earth atoms reached quantum degeneracy so far, except ytterbium which
10−1 was
has an alkali-earth-like electronic structure.69 A phase-space density of
reported for Sr but BEC could not be reached.18

≃

On this respect, the results of the collisional measurements reported in 4 sug-
gest that evaporative cooling on pure samples of either 86Sr or 88Sr cannot be very
eﬃcient in our experimental conditions. 86Sr presents an extremely large elastic
cross-section, a good point to establish a fast thermalization, but the 3-body re-
combination rate introduces a loss channel that is fatal with the typical geometries
accessible through optical dipole trapping. An optical trap with a much larger trap-
ping volume would partially suppress this loss channel.70 88Sr instead turns out to
be stable against 3-body decay, but the small elastic cross-section results in a long
thermalization time compared to typical trap lifetime.

On the other hand, our results suggest a novel all-optical sympathetic cool-
ing scheme.2 In the isotope mixture the relatively large inter-species cross-section
results in thermalization times typically of the order of few milliseconds. This ther-
malization is fast even on the time scale of laser cooling on the intercombination
1S0-3P1 transition. Moreover, due to the 164 MHz 86Sr-88Sr isotopic shift and the
natural linewidth of 7.6 kHz for the 1S0-3P1 transition, laser cooling on one isotope
has negligible eﬀect on the other one. It is then possible to cool sympathetically a
dense and optically thick cloud of one isotope (for instance 88Sr) via optical cool-
ing of a small sample of the other isotope (86Sr). Continuous laser cooling of 86Sr
provides heat dissipation in the sample, while the small optical depth on 86Sr does
not limit the achievable minimum temperature. Sympathetic cooling with neutral
atoms normally requires a thermal bath with heat capacity large with respect to
that of the sample to be cooled. This is due to the fact that when the thermal bath
is cooled by evaporative cooling, each lost atom carries an energy of the order of
few times the temperature of the sample. In the case of optical-sympathetic cooling,
each laser-cooled atom can subtract an energy of the order of the optical recoil in
a time corresponding to a few lifetimes of the excited state, without being lost.

We implemented the optical-sympathetic cooling scheme by extending the tem-
poral overlap between the FORT and the 86Sr red MOT after switching oﬀ the
88Sr MOT. Figure 10 reports the dynamics of optical-sympathetic cooling, starting
from an initial temperature of 15-20 µK, limited by density dependent heating.48,70
It can be observed that the cooling process does not induce losses on 88Sr while
the number of 86Sr atoms exponentially decays with a 80 ms lifetime. About 100 ms
after switching oﬀ the 88Sr red MOT, we observe that the mixture attains thermal
equilibrium.

Under optimized conditions (overall optical intensity 100Isat) the temperature
decays from the initial value with a 150 ms time constant. The minimum attainable
temperature depends both on the intensity of the 86Sr cooling beam, and the 88Sr

pensate for the reduction in thermalization rate during evaporation.71

6. Ultracold Sr atoms as quantum sensors

Ultracold atomic strontium is particularly suited for applications in the ﬁeld of
quantum sensors. Atom interferometry has already been used with alkali-metals
for precision inertial sensing,72,73 for measuring fundamental constants,74,75,76 and
testing relativity.77 The extremely small size of ultracold atomic samples enables
precision measurements of forces at micrometer scale. This is a challenge in physics
for studies of surfaces, Casimir eﬀect,78 and searches for deviations from Newtonian
gravity predicted by theories beyond the standard model.79,80,81

An interesting class of quantum devices is represented by ultracold atoms con-
ﬁned in an optical lattice, that is a dipole trap created by a laser standing wave.82
In particular, Bloch oscillations were predicted for electrons in a periodic crystal
potential in presence of a static electric ﬁeld83 but could not be observed in natu-
ral crystals because of the scattering of electrons by the lattice defects. They were
directly observed using atoms in an optical lattice.84

The combination of the periodic optical potential and a linear potential pro-
duced by a constant force F along the lattice wave-vector gives rise to Bloch os-
cillations at frequency νB given by νB = F λL
2h , where λL is the wavelength of the
light producing the lattice, and h is Plancks constant. Since λL is well known, the
force along the lattice axis can be accurately determined by measuring the Bloch
frequency νB. In order to perform a sensitive force measurement, a long coherence
time with respect to the measurement duration is required. The most common
eﬀects limiting the coherence time for ultracold atoms are perturbations due to
electromagnetic ﬁelds and atom-atom interactions. 88Sr is in this respect an ideal
choice because in the ground state it has zero orbital, spin and nuclear angular

tion, as shown in section 4 88Sr has remarkably small atom-atom interactions. Such
properties make Sr in optical lattices a unique sensor for small-scale forces with
better performances and reduced complexity compared to proposed schemes using
degenerate Bose or Fermi gases.85,86 This enables new experiments on gravity in
unexplored regions.

We tested such idea by measuring the gravitational acceleration in our labora-

tory with a 88Sr sample in a vertical optical lattice. To this end, we cool
atoms in the red MOT down to the recoil temperature (see section 3.4), so that the
vertical momentum distribution is narrower than the width of the ﬁrst Brillouin

7. Frequency measurements on the Sr intercombination lines

The advent of laser cooling techniques had important consequences on time-
frequency metrology, by reducing the uncertainty on the frequency of atomic clocks
caused by atom motion.

The recent progresses in two related ﬁelds, namely high-resolution laser spec-
troscopy and direct optical-frequency comb generation, opened the way to a new
generation of frequency standards based on transitions in the optical domain. The
use of frequency combs based on self-mode-locked femtosecond lasers has made
possible, for the ﬁrst time, relatively simple optical-frequency measurements.87,88
On the other hand, the realization of lasers with ultra-narrow emission band now
enables spectroscopy on forbidden optical transitions with quality factor Q = ν
∆ν
in excess of 1015.

Because of their higher frequency, optical transitions have the potential for
greatly improved accuracy and stability compared to conventional atomic clocks
based on microwave frequency transitions.89 Diﬀerent transitions are now consid-

ered as optical-frequency standards, involving single ions and neutral atoms.90,91
While single ions oﬀer an excellent control on systematic eﬀects, clouds of laser
cooled atoms have the potential for extremely high precision, as the large number
of atoms reduces the quantum projection noise. Perhaps the use of optical lattices
at the magic wavelength to conﬁne neutral atoms in the Lamb-Dicke regime, as
proposed for the ﬁrst time on strontium,17,92 summarizes the best of both worlds;
that is, a large number of quantum absorbers with negligible shift of the optical
clock transition due to external ﬁelds, Doppler eﬀect and collisions.

Among the neutral atoms, Sr has long been considered as one of the most
interesting candidates.93 Several features, some of which are speciﬁc to this atom,
allow diﬀerent possibilities for the realization of a high precision optical clock. The
visible intercombination 51S-53P lines from the ground state are easily accessible
with semiconductor lasers. Depending on the speciﬁc ﬁne-structure component and
on the isotope, a wide choice of transitions with diﬀerent natural linewidths is
possible (see section 2).

The ﬁrst phase-coherent absolute frequency measurement of a Sr intercombina-
tion line was performed by our group on the 51S0-53P1 transition, using a ther-
mal atomic beam.9 This represented an improvement by several orders of magni-
tude with respect to previous data.94 Our result is in agreement with subsequent
phase-coherent measurements performed by the BNM-SYRTE group on a thermal
sample,8 and by the JILA group on a free-falling ultracold sample using a red
MOT.10 The JILA measurement provided a further improvement in the accuracy
by more than two orders of magnitude.

However, the 1S0-3P1 transition is not best suited as a ﬁnal frequency reference,
due to its natural linewidth of 7.6 kHz. Some groups recently began working on
the 698 nm 1S0-3P0 line, that is strictly forbidden in the even isotopes since it is
J = 0 transition. In 87Sr the hyperﬁne mixing enables direct 1S0-
a J = 0
3P0 excitation with a transition probability of
1 mHz. The BNM-SYRTE group

lattice on this transition,19 followed by the JILA and BNM-SYRTE groups.95,22

In spite of its large quality factor, the 1S0-3P0 transition in odd Sr and Yb
isotopes suﬀers from residual sensitivity to stray magnetic ﬁelds and optical lattice
polarization, besides a complex line structure due to the presence of many magnetic
sublevels. Several groups are now looking at the even Sr or Yb isotopes as the best
candidates to represent optical frequency standards based on neutral atoms. Some
groups have proposed diﬀerent methods to directly excite the clock transition on the
even Sr or Yb isotopes, by properly engineering the atomic level structure to create

a ﬁnite and controllable 1S0-3P0 transition probability. These methods basically
consist in coupling the metastable 3P0 level to other electronic states by using either
multiple near-resonant laser ﬁelds,97,98 or simply a small static magnetic ﬁeld.99
The latter scheme has been experimentally demonstrated on 174Yb at NIST.100
The possible instability due to site-to-site tunneling in optical lattice clocks has
been addressed by the BNM-SYRTE group.21 For accuracy goals at the 10−18 level
they propose the use of vertical optical lattices, in order to lift the degeneracy
between adjacent potential wells.

7.1. Frequency measurement on the 1S0-3P1 transition with a

thermal beam

In this section we discuss our precision frequency measurements on the intercombi-
nation 51S0-53P1 transition.9 Using a femtosecond laser comb, we determined the
absolute frequency of the transition for 88Sr and 86Sr and an accurate value for the
isotope shift.

The frequency measurements have been performed through saturation spec-
troscopy on a thermal beam with the apparatus described in appendix A.3. As
frequency-comb generator we employed a commercial system based on a Kerr-lens
mode-locked Ti:Sa laser with a repetition rate of 1 GHz.101 Its repetition rate and
carrier envelope oﬀset frequency were locked to a GPS stabilized quartz oscillator.
The strontium atomic beam is obtained from the metal heated to 830 K. Residual
atomic beam divergency is 25 mrad and the typical atomic density in the detec-
tion region is 108 cm−3. We derive a Doppler-free signal using a retro-reﬂected
laser beam perpendicular to the atomic beam. The ﬂuorescence light from the laser
excited atoms is collected on a photomultiplier tube.

We estimate the indetermination on the reﬂection angle of the laser beam to be
less than 10 µrad. The peak beam intensity of 60 µW/cm2 (to be compared to the
saturation intensity of 3 µW/cm2) was chosen to obtain suﬃcient signal-to-noise
for the RC lock onto the atomic resonance. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld of 10 G (see
ﬁgure 18) deﬁnes the quantization axis in the interrogation region such that the
light is π polarized. The double pass AOM next to the atomic detection (AOM3) is
frequency modulated at 10 kHz to derive the locking signal of the cavity onto the
atomic line.

Figure 14 shows the Doppler broadened resonances of 88Sr, 86Sr, and the hy-
perﬁne structure of 87Sr. The residual atomic beam divergency produces a residual
Doppler broadening of 60 MHz FWHM. In the inset, the sub-Doppler signal for
88Sr is shown. Two independent measurements of the sub-Doppler resonance show
a FWHM of about 50 kHz, which is in agreement with the expected value consid-
ering the saturation and transit time broadening, and the recoil splitting.

Figure 15 shows the result of the measurement of the 88Sr transition frequency
taken over a period of several days. Each data point corresponds to the averaging
of the values resulting from consecutive measurements taken with a 1 s integration

88Sr transition frequency, including the corrections discussed previously, is 434 829

7.2. 86Sr - 88Sr isotopic shift measurement

With a minor change in the apparatus, we locked simultaneously the frequency of
two laser beams to the sub-Doppler signals of 86Sr and 88Sr. This system allowed
us to measure the isotopic shift of the 1S0-3P1 transition by counting the beat
note between the two interrogating beams. For this purpose, the reference cavity is
locked to the 88Sr resonance as described previously and the light for 86Sr is derived
from the same laser beam and brought to resonance through AOMs. The two beams
are overlapped in a single mode optical ﬁber and sent to the interrogation region.
By frequency modulating the beams at diﬀerent rates and using phase sensitive
detection we get the lock signal for both the isotopes from the same photomultiplier.
In this isotope-shift measurement most of the noise sources are basically common
mode and rejected. The measured 88Sr-86Sr isotope shift for the 1S0-3P1 transition
is 163 817.4 (0.2) kHz. This value represented an improvement in accuracy of more
than three orders of magnitude with respect to previously available data.102 The
86Sr optical frequency then amounts to 434 828 957 494 (10) kHz.

8. Conclusions

The strontium atom is an attractive candidate both for physical studies and for
applications. We have shown how the properties of atomic strontium are suited
for laser cooling and trapping, for the study of ultracold atomic physics, and for
applications to optical frequency metrology or to micrometric force sensors.

Future work on ultracold strontium oﬀers intriguing perspectives, including the
possible realization of a nearly non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate, the real-
ization of an optical clock with ultimate stability, or direct experimental tests of
theories beyond the standard model.

Appendix A. Experimental setup

The typical experimental setup for Sr laser cooling and trapping basically includes
a vacuum system, a blue laser source for the atom collection and ﬁrst cooling stage,
a red laser for second stage cooling and precision spectroscopy, and an infrared laser
source for the optical dipole trap. In the following we illustrate these main parts as
they are realized in our laboratory.

A.1. Vacuum system

The apparatus consists in three major parts: the oven, the Zeeman slower, and the
MOT chamber. The oven generates an atomic strontium vapor by sublimation from

metallic strontium kept at
800 Kelvin. The vapor is collimated into an atomic
beam passing through a nozzle ﬁlled with about 200 stainless steel capillaries 8 mm
long which insure a ballistic divergence of the atomic beam of 20 mRad.103 Keeping
the capillaries at a higher temperature prevents internal vapor condensation and
clogging.

∼

Following the atomic trajectory (see the sketch in ﬁgure 16), the atoms pass
through a region with radial optical access for 2D transverse cooling,31,32 they
are decelerated through the Zeeman slower,30 and ﬁnally stopped in the cell that
hosts the MOT. The optical access for for 2D transverse cooling is provided by
a CF35 cube aligned on the atomic beam. On the two free direction two pairs of
windows, AR coated for 461 and 689 nm, are sealed with modiﬁed copper gaskets.104
A diﬀerential pumping stage between the transverse cooling region and the Zeeman
slower insures decoupled background pressure between the oven and MOT region.
The oven is pumped by a 20 l/s ion pump while the MOT is pumped by a 20 l/s ion
pump and a titanium sublimation pump. With this setup, in operation condition,
we achieve a pressure of 10−7 Torr in the transverse cooling region, and a pressure
of 10−9 Torr on the MOT cell. A BK7 window on the atomic beam axis provides
access for the Zeeman slower decelerating beam. To prevent chemical reaction of
strontium and darkening, the anti-reﬂection is only present on the outer side of
the window , and the window is heated to
450 Kelvin. Paying attention to block
the Sr beam when unnecessary, the window presents a dim shadow after two years
of operation. In the future we plan to exchange the window with a sapphire one,

A.2. Blue laser sources

The light at 461 nm (see ﬁgure 1) used for the atomic beam deceleration and cap-
ture in the MOT is produced by second-harmonic generation (SHG) of a 922 nm
semiconductor laser (see ﬁgure 17). We generate the 922 nm radiation with a mas-
ter oscillator-parametric ampliﬁer system (MOPA). An anti-reﬂection coated laser
diode mounted in an extended cavity in Littrow conﬁguration (ECDL)105 delivers
50 mW at 922 nm, that is ampliﬁed to 1.2 W in a tapered ampliﬁer (TA). Opti-
cal isolators are placed between the ECDL and the TA, and between the TA and
the frequency doubler cavity, in order to prevent optical feedback into the master
laser, and optical damages on the ampliﬁer. The frequency doubler is composed of
a 20 mm long periodically-poled KTP crystal, placed in an optical build up cavity.
The crystal facets are anti-reﬂection coated both at 922 and 461 nm (R < 0.2 %)
and the poling period is chosen to fulﬁll quasi-phase matching of our wavelength
at room temperature. The resonator has an input coupling mirror with 11 % trans-
mission and it is held in resonance with the input light feeding the error signal from
a H¨ansch-Couillaud detector106 to a PZT controlled folding mirror. Under optimal
conditions we obtain 300 mW in the blue and routinely we work with 200 mW. We
frequency stabilize this blue source to the 1S0-1P1 line of 88Sr by means of conven-
tional saturated spectroscopy in a strontium heatpipe. The servo loop acts on the
piezo of the ECDL.

The light used for atomic manipulation and detection is brought to the vacuum
system through single-mode polarization-maintaining optical ﬁbers to improve the
long-term beam pointing stability.

As we discussed in section 3.3, we employ a turquoise laser at 497 nm to increase
the MOT lifetime and number of atoms loaded. As in the case of 461 nm source,
there are no laser diodes available at 497 nm and the simplest method to produce
this light is frequency doubling an IR laser at 994 nm. In this application 1 mW
of light is suﬃcient to saturate the process, then we do not need any ampliﬁca-
tion of the IR light before frequency doubling. The source at 497 nm diﬀers from
that at 461 nm in few parts. The master laser is an anti-reﬂection coated diode in
ECDL Littrow conﬁguration. After the beam shaping optics, the IR light is cou-
pled into a bow-tie cavity that contains a 17 mm long, b-cut potassium niobate
crystal which is kept at 328 K in order to satisfy non-critical phase matching for
SHG. The crystal facets are AR coated both for the fundamental and the blue light
and, like the 461 nm source, the cavity is kept resonant to the 994 nm laser with
a H¨ansch-Couillaud locking. Since this laser operates among Sr excited states it is
not possible to lock the laser to the atomic line on a simple heatpipe. Possible fre-
quency stabilization methods include locking to a reference cavity or spectroscopy
on an atomic sample with a suitable fraction of excited atoms, such as a hollow
cathode lamp, or an heatpipe with gas discharge, or simply the MOT. We chose
the latter system, in spite of the fact that the blue MOT ﬂuorescence signal is not
continuously available during our measurement cycles. In fact the short-term laser
frequency stability is suﬃcient to keep it in resonance with the 3P2-3D2 transition
for some tens of seconds. Thus we leave the laser free running, and we manually
adjust its frequency at the beginning of the measurement cycle by acting on the
piezo of the ECDL to maximize the MOT ﬂuorescence.

A.3. Red laser source

The 689 nm source is composed of a laser diode frequency-locked to an optical
cavity whose modes are stabilized to keep the laser on resonance with the atomic
line. A scheme of the experimental setup is given in ﬁgure 18. An extended cav-
ity laser-diode mounted in the Littrow conﬁguration delivers 15 mW at 689 nm.
Optical feedback into the ECDL is prevented by a 40 dB optical isolator and a
single pass acusto-optic modulator in cascade. The laser linewidth is reduced by
locking the laser to an optical reference cavity (RC) with standard Pound-Drever-
Hall technique;107 the phase modulation is produced by an electro-optic modulator
(EOM) driven at 11 MHz and leaves 85 % of the power in the carrier. The reference
cavity has a free spectral range (FSR) of 1.5 GHz and a ﬁnesse of
7000. On one
side of the quartz spacer we glued a concave mirror (R= 50 cm) while on the other
side a PZT is glued between the spacer and a ﬂat mirror in order to steer the modes
of the cavity by more than one FSR.

ECDL (1 kHz bandwidth), and a high frequency channel acting on the laser-diode
current supply (
3 MHz bandwidth). Under lock condition more than 55 % of the
incident light is transmitted through the cavity. From the frequency noise spectrum
obtained by comparison with an independent cavity we can infer a laser linewidth
lower than 20 Hz, and more than 90 % of the optical power in the carrier.108,109 The
RC is acoustically isolated, though we do not keep it under vacuum.110 The optical
table is actively isolated from seismic noise with pneumatic legs. The frequency
drifts of the cavity are compensated by the servo to the atomic signal which acts
on the PZT of the high ﬁnesse cavity with a 20 Hz bandwidth. In the frequency
measurement experiment described in section 15 the Doppler free saturated ﬂuo-
rescence on a thermal strontium beam provides the signal for cavity stabilization
on the atomic line. The thermal beam source has a similar design as described in
A.1 and it is pumped by a 20 l/s ion pump. However, when using the stable 689 nm
laser for second stage cooling and trapping, as described in section 3.4, we employ
an heat-pipe kept at
750 K instead of the thermal beam, thus obtaining a larger
signal and a more robust lock.

A.4. Infrared laser sources for dipole trapping

After the production of an ultracold sample in double stage magneto-optical trap-
ping, we transfer the atoms in an optical dipole trap made of two infrared laser
beams crossing each other near the waist. The two beams, respectively aligned
along the horizontal and vertical direction, are produced with two independent TA
injected with light coming from the same infrared source used for producing the
blue light (see ﬁgure 19), that is close enough to the “magic wavelength” for the

pled into a ﬁber and sent to the two ampliﬁers. The injection of the two TAs it is
regulated by two AOMs which are used to shift the frequency of the two beams
(avoiding interference at the center of the dipole trap) and to apply a fast control to
the output TA optical power. For mode cleaning and delivering the output beams
from the TAs to the atoms, we use two independent single mode ﬁbers. Typically
we obtain about 650 mW and 440 mW at the ﬁber output for the horizontal and
vertical beams, respectively. We ﬁnally focus the beams at the MOT center, with
1/e2 radii of 15 µm and 35 µm respectively.

Abstract
We consider three-loop radiative corrections to the Lamb shift and hyperﬁne splitting. Correc-
tions of order α3(Zα)5m are the largest still unknown contributions to the Lamb shift in hydrogen.
We calculated radiative corrections to the Lamb shift and hyperﬁne splitting generated by the
diagrams with insertions of one radiative photon and electron polarization loops in the graphs
with two external photons. We also obtained corrections generated by the gauge invariant sets
of diagrams with two reducible radiative photon insertions in the electron line and polarization
operator insertion in one of the radiative photons, and diagrams with two reducible radiative pho-
ton insertions in the electron line and polarization operator insertion in one the external photons.
Corrections to the Lamb shift and hyperﬁne splitting generated by the diagrams with insertions
of the three-loop one-particle reducible diagrams with radiative photons in the electron line are
calculated in the Yennie gauge.

INTRODUCTION

The largest still unknown contributions to the Lamb shift in hydrogen are corrections of
order α3(Zα)5m. The magnitude of these corrections can be easily estimated multiplying
the corrections of order α2(Zα)5m (see, e.g., [1,2]) by an extra factor α/π. The contributions
of order α3(Zα)5m turn out be as large as 1 kHz for the 1S state in hydrogen. Below we
present our recent results for three-loop radiative corrections to the Lamb shift and hyperﬁne
splitting.

Nonrecoil corrections of order α3(Zα)5m to the Lamb shift and corrections of order
α3(Zα)EF to hyperﬁne splitting are generated by three-loop radiative insertions in the
skeleton diagram in Fig. 1. Respective corrections of lower orders in α generated by one-
and two-loop radiative insertions are already well known (see, e.g., review [3]). The crucial
observation, which greatly facilitates further calculations, is that the scattering approxima-
tion is adequate for calculation of all corrections of order αn(Zα)5m and αn(Zα)EF (see,
e.g., a detailed proof in [4]). One may easily understand the physical reasons which lead to
this conclusion. Consider the matrix elements of the skeleton diagram in Fig. 1 with the on
shell external electron lines calculated between the free electron spinors, and multiplied by
the square of the Schr¨odinger-Coulomb wave function at the origin. They are described by
the infrared divergent integral

in the case of the Lamb shift, and by the infrared divergent integral1

in the case of hyperﬁne splitting. In these integrals k is the dimensionless momentum of the
exchanged photons measured in the units of the electron mass.

(cid:1)

FIG. 1: Skeleton two-photon diagram

Let us consider radiative insertions in the skeleton two-photon diagram in Fig. 1. Account of
these corrections eﬀectively leads to insertion of an additional factor L(k) in the divergent
integrals above, and while this factor has at most a logarithmic asymptotic behavior at

anomalous magnetic moment, and Z is the nucleus charge in terms of the electron charge (Z = 1 for

large momenta and does not spoil the ultraviolet convergence of the integrals, in the low-
momentum region it behaves as L(k) ∼ k2 (again up to logarithmic factors), and improves
the low-frequency behavior of the integrand. However, the integral for the Lamb shift
is sometimes still divergent after inclusion of the radiative corrections because the two-
photon-exchange diagram, even with radiative corrections, contains a contribution of the
previous order in Zα. This spurious contribution should be removed by subtracting the
leading low-momentum term from L(k)/k4. The result of such subtraction is a convergent
integral, where the low integration momenta (of atomic order mZα) in the exchange loops
are suppressed, and the eﬀective loop integration momenta are of order m. Then it is clear
that small virtuality of the external electron lines would lead to an additional suppression
of the matrix element under consideration, and it is suﬃcient to consider the diagrams only
with on-mass-shell external momenta for calculation of the contributions to the energy shifts.
As an additional bonus of this approach one does not need to worry about the ultraviolet
divergence of the one-loop radiative corrections. The subtraction automatically eliminates
any ultraviolet divergent terms and the result is both ultraviolet and infrared ﬁnite.

IV. DIAGRAMS WITH THREE-LOOP ELECTRON VACUUM POLARIZATION

A. Lamb Shift

For calculation of the correction generated by the diagrams in Fig. 4 we need the three-
loop vacuum polarization operator (α/π)3k2I3e. Seven leading terms both in the low- and
high-momentum asymptotic expansions of I3e over the powers of the momentum were calcu-
lated analytically in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. We adjusted these results for the case of the momentum
renormalization scheme used in QED, and constructed an interpolation which approximates
the three-loop polarization operator for all Euclidean momenta.

The skeleton integral in eq.(1) remains infrared divergent even after insertion of the three-
loop vacuum polarization since I3e(0) 6= 0. This linear infrared divergence is eﬀectively cut
oﬀ at the characteristic atomic scale mZα if we restore ﬁnite virtualities of the external
electron lines. As mentioned in the Introduction, such infrared divergence lowers the power
of the factor Zα, and respective would be divergent contribution turns out to be of order

4

α3(Zα)4. We carry out the subtraction of the leading low-frequency asymptote of the polar-
ization operator insertion, which corresponds to the subtraction of the leading low-frequency
asymtote in the integrand for the contribution to the energy shift ˜I3e(k) ≡ I3e(k) − I3e(0),
and insert the subtracted expression in the formula for the Lamb shift in eq.(1). Then the
contribution to the energy shift has the form [5]

V. DIAGRAMS WITH ONE-LOOP ELECTRON FACTOR AND TWO ONE-
LOOP ELECTRON VACUUM POLARIZATIONS

A. Lamb Shift

To calculate the correction of order α3(Zα)5 generated by the gauge invariant set of
diagrams in Fig. 5 we need a new element, namely, the gauge invariant electron factor LL(k)
in Fig. 6 which describes all possible insertions of the radiative photon in the electron line
with two external photons. An explicit expression for this electron factor was obtained in
diﬀerent forms in [11, 12, 13, 14]. Inserting in the skeleton integral in eq.(1) the electron
factor (α/π)k2LL(k), one-loop polarization operator squared and the multiplicity factor 3
we obtain the radiative correction in the form

XII. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

We calculated three-loop radiative corrections to the Lamb shift of order α3(Zα)5m and
three-loop radiative corrections to hyperﬁne splitting of order α3(Zα)EF generated by the
gauge invariant sets of diagrams in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 15. Collecting all
contributions above we obtain

Numerically for the 1S level in hydrogen this contribution is δEL = 0.252 kHz.

For hyperﬁne splitting we obtain

Numerically for the ground state in muonium the contribution is δEHF S = −0.001 7 kHz.

We also calculated corrections of order α3(Zα)5m to the Lamb shift and corrections of
order α3(Zα)EF to hyperﬁne splitting generated by the diagrams in Fig. 16. These factorized
contributions are not gauge invariant and calculations we made in the Yennie gauge. We
obtained [17]

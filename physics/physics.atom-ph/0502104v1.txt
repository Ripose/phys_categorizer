Calculation of the energy levels of Ge, Sn, Pb and their ions in the V N −4
approximation

(Dated: November 24, 2013)

Energy levels of germanium, tin and lead together with their single, double and triple ionized
positive ions have been calculated using the V N−M approximation suggested in the previous work
(Dzuba, physics/0501032) (M = 4 - number of valence electrons). Initial Hartree-Fock calculations
are done for the quadruply ionized ions with all valence electrons removed. The core-valence cor-
relations are included beyond the second-order of the many-body perturbation theory. Interaction
between valence electrons is treated by means of the conﬁguration interaction technique. It is demon-
strated that accurate treatment of the core-valence correlations lead to systematic improvement of
the accuracy of calculations for all ions and neutral atoms.

INTRODUCTION

This work further develops the V N −M approximation
suggested in Ref. [1]. It also presents the details of the
calculations of the energy levels of Ge II, Sn II and Pb II
[2] which were needed to study their dependence on the
ﬁne structure constant α (α = e2/¯hc). Some lines of
Ge II, Sn II and Pb II have been observed in quasar ab-
sorption spectra and the information on the dependence
of corresponding frequencies on α is needed to study
possible variation of the ﬁne structure constant at early
epoch.

In the vicinity of the physical value of α the frequency

of an atomic transition can be presented in a form

ω = ω0 + qx,
where x = (α/α0)2 − 1 and α0 and ω0 are the present-
day laboratory values of the ﬁne structure constant and
transition frequency.

(1)

The values of the q-coeﬃcients can only be found from
atomic calculations by, e.g., varying the value of α in
computer codes based on relativistic equations. In many
cases calculated values of the q-coeﬃcients are more sta-
ble than the energies. This is because they are not sensi-
tive to incompleteness of the basis set with respect to the
principal quantum number n. Indeed, relativistic correc-
tions are proportional to 1/ν3 [3] (ν is the eﬀective prin-
cipal quantum number) while energies are proportional
to 1/ν2. If we include more states of high ν this would
have greater eﬀect on the energies than on relativistic
corrections presented by q-coeﬃcients.

However, in the case of strong conﬁguration mixing
and level pseudo-crossing calculation of q-coeﬃcients may
become very unstable [4]. In the vicinity of level pseudo-
crossing the values of q-coeﬃcients change very rapidly
with α and small error in determining the position of the
level crossing may lead to large error in the values of q.

Level pseudo-crossing always means strong conﬁgura-
tion mixing between the states. However, strong conﬁg-
uration mixing may also take place without level pseudo-
crossing. This can also cause instability in calculated
values of q-coeﬃcients. Indeed, relativistic correction to
the energy of a single electron state |njlmi strongly de-
pends on the total momentum j of this state (see, e.g.
formula (7) in Ref. [3]). Therefore conﬁgurations com-
posed from states of diﬀerent j may have very diﬀerent
values of q and small error in the the conﬁguration mix-
ing coeﬃcients would lead to large error in the resulting
q value for the mixed state [5].

Strong conﬁguration mixing and level pseudo-crossing
take place for Ge II, Sn II and Pb II ions [2] as well as for
many other atoms and ions [4]. This means that calcu-
lations need to be done to very high accuracy to ensure
stable values of the q-coeﬃcients. The criterion is that
deviation of the calculated energies from the experimen-
tal values must be much smaller than the experimental
energy interval between mixed states.

There are many other areas of research where accurate
atomic calculations are needed. These include parity and
time invariance violation in atoms (see, e.g. [6]), atomic
clocks [7], interaction of positrons with atoms [8], etc.

A way to do accurate calculations for atoms with sev-
eral s and/or p valence electrons has been suggested in
Ref. [1]. It is called “the V N −M approximation”, where
V is the Hartree-Fock potential created by N − M elec-
trons of the closed shell ion, N is total number of elec-
trons in neutral atom and M is the number of valence
electrons. Initial Hartree-Fock calculations are done for
a closed-shell positive ion with all valence electrons re-
moved.
It has been demonstrated in Ref. [1] that the
Hartree-Fock potential of the closed-shell positive ion is
often a good starting approximation for a neutral atom.
This is the case when valence electrons are localized on
distances larger than the size of the core. Then they
can aﬀect only energies of core states but not their wave
functions. Since the potential created by core electrons
depends on the electron charge density and does not de-
pend on electron energies it doesn’t matter which core

states are used to calculate the potential - states of the
neutral atom or states of the closed-shell positive ion.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian for valence electrons is con-
structed using the conﬁguration interaction (CI) tech-
nique. Core-valence correlations are included by adding
the electron correlation operator ˆΣ to the CI Hamilto-
nian. Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) is used to
calculate ˆΣ. The main advantage of the V N −M approxi-
mation is that MBPT is relatively simple (no subtraction
diagrams) and the ˆΣ operator can be calculated beyond
the second-order of the MBPT. It has been demonstrated
in Ref. [1] that inclusion of the higher-order core valence
correlations lead to further signiﬁcant improvement of
the accuracy of calculations.

In the previous work [1] the V N −M approximation was
used for Kr and Ba while higher-order core-valence cor-
relations were included for Ba and Ba+ only.
In the
present work we study twelve complicated many-electron
systems including germanium, tin, lead and their positive
ions. We demonstrate that using the V N −4 approxima-
tion (M = 4 for the case of Ge, Sn and Pb) and accurate
treatment of the core-valence correlations lead to high
accuracy of calculations for all twelve systems. This in-
dicates that the V N −M approximation is a good approx-
imation for a wide range of atoms and ions.

ˆΣ1 is the correlation potential operator which is exactly
the same in the V N −M approximation as for the single-
valence electron atoms (see, e.g. [9]). It can be calculated
in the second-order of the MBPT. Selected chains of the
higher-order diagrams can be included into ˆΣ1 in all or-
ders using technique developed for single-valence electron
atoms (see, e.g. [10]).

ˆh2 is the two-electron part of the Hamiltonian

ˆh2 =

ˆΣ2 is the two-electron part of core-valence correlations.
It represents screening of Coulomb interaction between
valence electrons by core electrons. We calculate ˆΣ2 in
the second order of MBPT. Inclusion of the higher-order
correlations into ˆΣ2 will be a subject of further study.

However, the calculations show that in most cases accu-
rate treatment of ˆΣ1 is more important than for ˆΣ2. The
details of the calculation of ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 can be found else-
where [9, 10, 11, 12]. Note however that in contrast to the
previous works [11, 12] we have no so called subtraction
diagrams.

Number of electrons M is the only parameter in the ef-
fective Hamiltonian (2) which changes when we move be-
tween diﬀerent ions of the same atom. The terms V N −4,
ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 remain exactly the same.

The form of the eﬀective Hamiltonian is also the same
for all ions if some other potential V is used to gener-
ate the core states. However, the ˆΣ operator would have
terms proportional to V N −4 − V (subtraction diagrams
[11]). In the V N −M approximation V ≡ V n−4 and sub-
traction diagrams disappear. The MBPT becomes rel-
atively simple which makes it easier to include higher-
order core-valence correlations.

A. Electron shell structure of lead.

To understand how the V N −M approximation works
it is very instructive to look at electron shells of a many-
electron atom. We chose lead because it is the heaviest
of the considered atoms. It probably has the richest pos-
sible electron shell structure. Neutral lead has eighty
two electrons occupying six shells. Angular momentum
l ranges from 0 (s-electrons) to 3 (f -electrons). Figs. 1
and 2 present electron densities of Pb I (solid line) and
Pb V (dotted line) separately for s, p, d and f electrons.
The density is the sum over principal quantum number
n, total momentum j and its projection m while angular

momentum l is ﬁxed:

ρ(r)l = X
njm

|ψ(r)njlm|2r2.

The values of ρ(r)l in the maximum are very diﬀerent for
diﬀerent l. Therefore, we present normalized functions
ρ(r)l/ρmax to be able to ﬁt all graphs into one diagram.
Electron shell structure can be clearly seen on Fig. 1.
Each density has a local peak at n − l = 1, 2, etc. The
position of the peak depends mostly on n and is about
the same for all l. This means that all electrons with
the same n are localized at about the same distances
regardless of their angular momentum l, thus making a
shell.

The diﬀerence between Pb I and Pb V cannot be seen
on Fig. 1. Fig. 2 presents details of the right bottom
corner of the Fig. 1. Dotted lines which correspond to
electron densities of the Pb V ion show no peak at n =
6 because of absence of the 6s and 6p electrons. The
removal of four valence electrons has some eﬀect on the
density of d-electrons at about the same distances where
the 6s and 6p electrons are localized and practically no
eﬀect on the densities of all electrons on shorter distances.
This is because valence electrons are localized on large
distances and they can only create constant potential in
the core which can change the energies of the core states
but cannot change their wave functions.

One can see from Fig. 2 that there is an overlap be-
tween the wave functions of valence electrons of Pb I (6s
and 6p electrons) and the wave function of the core out-
ermost state 5d. We have presented for comparison on
Fig. 3 the electron densities of Ba I and Ba III on large
distances. It is easy to see that the overlap between core
and valence electrons in barium is much smaller than the
overlap between core and valence electrons in lead. As
a consequence, outermost core state of barium (5p) is
much less aﬀected by removal of two 6s electrons than
compared to the eﬀect of removal of two 6s and two
6p electrons on the 5d state of lead. This means that
the V N −2 approximation for Ba should work much bet-
ter than the V N −4 approximation for Pb. The situation
is exactly the same as for the V N −1 approximation for
atoms with one external electron. It is very well known
that the V N −1 approximation works extremely well for
alkali atoms and not so well for atoms like Ga, In, Tl, etc.
The reason is the same in both cases. Valence electrons
must not overlap with the core for the V N −M to be good
starting approximation regardless of whether M = 1 or
M > 1.

Similar to the fact that the V N −1 approximation is a
good approximation for thallium, although not as good
as for alkali atoms, the V N −M approximation is a good
approximation for Pb, Sn and Ge, although not as good
as for Ba.

Below we present speciﬁcs of calculations for germa-

nium, tin and lead.

B. Calculations for germanium

Germanium is the lightest of three atoms (Z=32) and
the easiest from computational point of view. Its ground
state conﬁguration is 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p2. The
core-valence correlations are relatively small due to small
number of electrons in the core.

We calculate ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 for the eﬀective Hamiltonian
(2) in the second order of the MBPT. Inclusion of ˆΣ1
brings single-electron energies of Ge IV to agreement with
the experiment on the level of 0.1%. No higher-order

core-valence correlations need to be included.

In fact, inclusion of the higher-order correlations using
technique developed in Ref. [10] doesn’t lead to better
results for germanium. This is because the technique
was developed for heavy atoms in which higher order
correlations are dominated by screening of the Coulomb
interaction between core and valence electrons by other
core electrons. In light atoms like germanium this eﬀect
does not dominate due to small number of electrons in
the core. Therefore, inclusion of screening, while other
higher-order eﬀects are not included, does not improve
the accuracy.

The results of calculations are presented in Table I.
The ground-state energies are given as energies to re-
move all valence electrons from an atom or ion (in atomic
units). Corresponding experimental energies are sums
of the ionization potentials of all relevant ions. For the
convenience of comparison with Moore’s tables [14] we
present energies of excited states relative to the ground
state in cm−1. Column marked CI presents the results of
the standard conﬁguration interaction method without
ˆΣ. Column ˆΣ(2) presents the results of calculations with
the eﬀective Hamiltonian (2) in which ˆΣ is calculated in
the second order of MBPT.

The results presented in Table I show that inclusion of
the core-valence correlations leads to systematic signiﬁ-
cant improvement of the accuracy of calculations for all
states of all ions and for neutral germanium.

C. Calculations for tin.

Tin atom (Z = 50) is very similar to the germanium
atom. Its ground state conﬁguration is . . . 5s25p2. How-
ever, correlations and relativistic corrections are larger.
It has some implication on the calculation scheme.
It
turns out that inclusion of the higher-order core-valence
correlations does lead to signiﬁcant improvement of the
results for all tin ions and for the neutral atom. We in-
clude screening of Coulomb interaction and hole-particle
interaction in all orders of the MBPT in the calculation
of ˆΣ1. It is done exactly the same way as in our calcu-
lations for single-valence-electron atoms (see, e.g.
[10]).
The ˆΣ2 operator is still calculated in the second order of
the MBPT.

The results are presented in Table II. There is one
more column in the table compared to Table I.
It is
marked ˆΣ(∞) and presents the results of calculations with
all-order ˆΣ1. Again, it easy to see that moving from
less sophisticated to more sophisticated approximations
(with no ˆΣ; with ˆΣ(2); with ˆΣ(∞)) leads to systematic
signiﬁcant improvement of the accuracy of the results.

D. Calculations for lead

The case of lead (Z = 82) is the most diﬃcult of the
calculations. Correlations are strong and relativistic ef-

fects are large too. Strong L − S interaction leads to
intersection of the ﬁne-structure multiplets. Also, states
of the same total momentum J are strongly mixed re-
gardless of the values of L and S assigned to them. The
breaking of the L − S scheme can be easily seen e.g.
by comparing experimental values of the Land´e g-factors
with the non-relativistic values.

We have done one more step for lead to further im-
prove the accuracy of calculations as compared to the
scheme used for tin. We have introduced the scaling fac-

tors before ˆΣ1 to ﬁt the energies of Pb IV. These energies
are found by solving Hartree-Fock-like equations for the
states of external electron of Pb IV in the V N −4 potential
of the atomic core

( ˆH0 + ˆΣ1 − ǫn)ψn = 0.

(5)

Here ˆH0 is the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. ˆΣ1 is the
all-order correlation potential operator similar to what is
used for tin. Inclusion of ˆΣ1 takes into account the eﬀect
of the core-valence correlations on both the energies (ǫn)
and the wave functions (ψn) of the valence states pro-
ducing the so-called Brueckner orbitals. The diﬀerence
between Brueckner and experimental energies of the 4s,
4p and 4d states of Pb IV are on the level of 0.2 - 0.4%
(for removal energies). To further improve the energies
we replace ˆΣ1 by f ˆΣ1 with rescaling factor f chosen to
ﬁt the energies exactly. Then the same rescaled operator
f ˆΣ1 is used for the Pb III and Pb II ions and for the
Pb I. It turns out that only small rescaling is needed.
Maximum deviation of the rescaling factor from unity
is 10%: f (4s) = 0.935, f (4p1/2) = 1.084, f (4p3/2) =
1.1, f (4d3/2) = 1.07, f (4d5/2) = 1.07.

The results of the calculations are presented in Ta-
ble III. Again, inclusion of core-valence correlations lead
to signiﬁcant improvement of the accuracy of the results
in all cases. However, comparison between diﬀerent ways
of treating core-valence correlations reveal a more com-
plicated picture compared to what we have for tin. When
we move from the second-order correlation operator ˆΣ(2)
to the all-order ˆΣ(∞) and then to the rescaled f ˆΣ(∞)
the improvement in accuracy is apparent for the removal
energies.
It is again systematic and signiﬁcant, bring-
ing results for all states of all ions and neutral lead to
better agreement with experiment. This is not always
the case for the energy intervals. When a more accurate
treatment of core-valence correlation is introduced two
energy levels way move cowards experimental values at
slightly diﬀerent rate so that the interval between them
does not improve. In Table III we present removal ener-
gies only for the ground states of Pb IV, Pb III, Pb II
and Pb I. Energies of excited states are given with re-
spect to the ground state. It is easy to see that energy
intervals between ground and excited states calculated
with second-order ˆΣ are often in better agreement with
experiment than the results with the all-order ˆΣ. In gen-
eral, the results are not as good as for tin. The reason
for this is larger overlap between valence and core states.
Relativistic eﬀects cause stronger binding of the 6s and
6p electrons of Pb compared to binding of the 5s and 5p
electrons of Sn. This means that overlap between valence
and core states is also larger for lead than for tin leading
to larger eﬀect of removal of valence electrons on atomic
core.

It is instructive to compare our results with the re-
sults of recent calculations by Safronova et al [15] (see
Table III). Energy levels of Pb II were calculated by
Safronova et al with the use of the coupled-cluster (CC)

approach and the third-order MBPT. The Pb II ion was
treated as an ion with one external electron above closed
shells. Therefore only energies of states in which the 6s
subshell remained closed were calculated. The agreement
with experiment for these states is slightly better than
for our results with ˆΣ(∞). The reason for this is better
treatment of the interaction between core and valence
electrons. The 6s electrons were included in the initial
Hartree-Fock procedure. Also, interaction between the
6p electron and the core is included in the CC approach
in all-orders of the MBPT.

This doesn’t mean that the V N −4 approximation is
not good for lead. First, as can be seen from Table III,
inclusion of core-valence correlation does lead to system-
atic signiﬁcant improvement of the accuracy and ﬁnal
results are very close to the experiment. Second, the
fact that inclusion of the higher order core-valence cor-
relations doesn’t always lead to improvement of energy
intervals doesn’t mean that the V N −4 approximation is
not good. It rather means that not all dominating higher-
order diagrams are included into ˆΣ(∞). The situation
is very similar to what takes place for single-valence-
electron atoms. The technique developed by us for alkali
atoms [10] doesn’t work very well for atoms like thallium
where interaction between valence electron and the core
is important. Here CC+MBPT approach gives better re-
sults [15] which may mean that the combination of the
CC approach with the CI method is a better option for
atoms like lead. This approach was recently considered
by Kozlov [16] and Johnson [17]. However, no calcula-
tions for real atoms have been done so far.

III. CONCLUSION

6

It has been demonstrated that the V N −4 approxima-
tion works very well for the four-valence-electrons atoms
like germanium, tin and lead as well as for their single,
double and triple ionized ions. The use of the V N −4 ap-
proximation makes it easy to include core-valence correla-
tions beyond the second order of the MBPT. Inclusion of
the core-valence correlations leads to signiﬁcant improve-
ment of the results in all cases. In general, the V N −M
approximation (M is the number of valence electrons) is
a good approximation if the overlap between core and va-
lence states is small. The best case is the alkaline-earth
atoms where the V N −2 approximation must produce ex-
cellent results. In contrast, the V N −M approximation is
not applicable at all to atoms with open d or/and f shells
unless uppermost core s and p states are also treated as
valence states. It should work more or less well for most
of the atoms/ions with s and/or p valence electrons. In
cases of relatively large overlap between core and valence
states good results can still be achieved if accurate treat-
ment of the interaction between core and valence elec-
trons is included perturbatively into the calculation of
the core-valence correlations.

[5] Strictly speaking, diﬀerent values of q for diﬀerent conﬁg-
urations would unavoidably lead to level crossing because
q is a slope of the E(α2) graph. When we say “there is
no level crossing” we mean that level crossing takes place
far away from α = α0.

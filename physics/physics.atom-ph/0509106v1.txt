Abstract

A new method for the detection of the electron edm using a solid is described. The method

involves the measurement of a voltage induced across the solid by the alignment of the samples

magnetic dipoles in an applied magnetic ﬁeld, H. A ﬁrst application of the method to GdIG
has resulted in a limit on the electron edm of 5 × 10−24 e-cm, which is a factor of 40 below the

limit obtained from the only previous solid-state edm experiment. The result is limited by the

imperfect discrimination of an unexpectedly large voltage that is even upon the reversal of the

sample magnetization.

Precision measurement of the electron edm provides one of the most important low en-

ergy tests of time-reversal symmetry (T) and of particle physics beyond the standard model

(SM) [1]. T violation in the SM is insuﬃcient to explain the observed baryon asymmetry

in the universe, suggesting new T-violating physics beyond the SM [2]. The present upper
bound on the electron edm, de < 1.6 × 10−27 e-cm, already seriously constrains supersymme-

try and many other SM extensions [3]. Several new experimental approaches are now being

pursued that hope to achieve sensitivities to the electron edm beyond those established by

the traditional heavy atom experiments in beams and cells [4, 5]. Cold trapped atoms [6, 7],

diatomic molecules [8, 9], trapped molecular ions [10], and solid state systems [11] are all

being investigated.

The idea to search for the electron edm in a solid was ﬁrst suggested by Shapiro [12].

All proposed solid-state methods rely on the fact that the electron edm must be collinear

with its magnetic moment, thus producing a linear magneto-electric (M-E) eﬀect. The only

previous solid-state edm experiment, done using nickel-zinc ferrite, yielded a limit on the
electron edm of de < 2 × 10−22 e-cm [13]. In this experiment SQUIDs were used to search for

a change in the sample magnetization with the reversal of an applied electric ﬁeld. Presently,

a reﬁnement of this approach using gadolinium-gallium garnet (GdGG) is being pursued at

Los Alamos. Our approach is the compliment of this method. We look for a change in the

voltage across a solid state sample when the magnetization of the sample is reversed.

We perform our search in gadolinium-iron-garnet (Gd3+

3 O12). The sensitivity of
GdIG to the electron edm comes through the Gd3+ ions. These ions have a high electronic

2 Fe3+

3 Fe3+

spin (7/2), no orbital angular momentum, and a favorable heavy-ion enhancement factor [14].

In the absence of T violation, the crystal symmetry of the GdIG forbids terms in the free
energy that go like HE (the linear M-E eﬀect) as well as terms of the form H 2E, where

H and E are the magnetic and electric ﬁelds [15]. The iron-garnets have high electrical

resistivity that limits the migration of free charges that might otherwise cancel the edm

induced dipole in the sample. The presence of the ferromagnetic iron lattices allows the

sample to be magnetized at relatively modest applied ﬁelds and temperatures. Calculations

have been undertaken that suggest that the existence of an electron edm with a magnitude

of the present upper bound would produce 1.1 nV across a pure GdIG sample 10 cm in

length and at 0 K [16]. A well designed detector would permit the measurement of such a

voltage in a few hundred seconds, suggesting that with realistic integration times one might

achieve a statistical limit on the electron edm one to two orders of magnitude better than

the present bound.

GdIG is ferrimagnetic and three diﬀerent lattices contribute to its magnetization

(Fig. 1) [17]. At 0 K, two iron lattices produce a magnetization per unit cell that sums
to 5 µB while the Gd3+ ions produce a magnetization of 21 µB in the opposite direction.
While the magnetization of the paramagnetic Gd3+ ions falls dramatically as the sample

temperature is increased to room temperature, the iron magnetization falls oﬀ only slowly

producing a compensation temperature (TC) at 290 K. At this temperature the sample has

no net magnetization while above (below) the magnetization is dominated by the iron (Gd)
lattice. The contribution to the magnetization made by the Gd3+ ions can be reduced by

replacing some of them with non magnetic yttrium (Y). The resulting compensation tem-
perature can then be adjusted according to the formula: TC = (290 − 115(3 − x)) K, where
x represents the average number of Gd and 3 − x represents the average number of Y per

unit cell [18].

We take advantage of this interesting temperature and Gd concentration dependence to

produce a distinctive temperature signature for the edm signal. Our sample is a 2” high

toroid (4” od and 2” id) with rectangular cross section. The toroidal geometry minimizes the

role of demagnetizing ﬁelds, permitting the magnetization of the sample at modest applied

ﬁelds. The geometry also allows the placement of the detector in a nearly ﬁeld free region.

FIG. 2: Observed magnetization of the two “C”s with an applied ﬁeld of 40 Oe. Squares (diamonds)

correspond to the “C” with 1.35 (1.8) Gd per unit formula cell.

The toroid is assembled from two “C”s that are geometrically identical. The electrodes are

formed by bonding two 0.001” thick copper foils between the “C”s using conductive epoxy.

“C1” has x = 1.35 and an observed compensation temperature of TC1 = 103 K while “C2”

has x = 1.8 and an observed TC2 = 154 K. At the signal temperature, TS = 127 K, the

magnetizations (M) of the two “C”s are identical (Fig. 2). However, TC1 < TS and hence the
net magnetization of C1 is antiparallel to the magnetization of its Gd3+ ions while TC2 > TS
and the net magnetization of C2 is parallel to the magnetization of its Gd3+ ions. Hence,
when a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld H is applied to the sample, the Gd3+ ions are all oriented

towards the same electrode (Fig. 3) and the resulting edm signals from the two halves
add constructively. By contrast, at temperatures below 103 K (above 154 K), the Gd3+

magnetization will be parallel (anti-parallel) to M on both sides of the toroid, resulting in

a strong cancellation of the edm voltage between the two electrodes. This dramatic change

in the edm voltage with toroid temperature allows one to distinguish the edm voltage from

voltage sources that might otherwise mimic the edm signal.

The sample is mounted in a toroid shaped copper Faraday cage (5.5” high, 6” od,

1.25” id). Heating elements attached directly to the outside of the copper cage enable

temperature regulation. A 336 turn coil of #17 magnet wire is wound on the outside of the

Faraday cage to produce H. Wires attached to the two electrodes at the outer radius of the

sample ascend vertically through two thin-walled stainless steel tubes to the preampliﬁers.

The preampliﬁer for each electrode consists of a Cascode pair of BF 245 JFETs and has

an input impedance of 1013 Ω and an input capacitance of about 4 pF. The preampliﬁers

are mounted in a copper and brass chamber with independent temperature monitoring and

control. The preampliﬁer, Faraday cage and sample are all contained within a vacuum

system that can be immersed in liquid nitrogen. The signals from the preampliﬁer are AC

coupled (time constant of 5 s) out of the vacuum chamber and further ampliﬁed before being

recorded on a digital oscilloscope.

Data collection consists of averaging (typically between 128 and 512 traces) and recording

the ampliﬁed electrode voltages as the direction of the sample magnetization is reversed

(0.9 Hz – 2.3 Hz). We collect data in two diﬀerent modes. In the “square wave” mode, H is

simply ﬂipped from one orientation and back again. H remains on during data acquisition.

In this mode we are usually limited by heating to applied ﬁelds of about 53 Oe, though for

short periods of time we have operated with up to 124 Oe.

In the “pulsed” mode, H is applied in a short pulse (typically between 7 and 50 ms)

with amplitudes of up to 425 Oe. Following a pulse, demagnetizing ﬁelds quickly result in

the decay of the magnetization of the more magnetized half of the sample to the remnant

magnetization of the less magnetized half. With matched magnetizations the toroid has only

an anapole moment and the remnant magnetization stabilizes and persists for many hours

after the magnetizing pulse. In this mode, the applied ﬁeld is not present during data acqui-

sition. Normally, we collect edm data at three operating temperatures with approximately

equal remnant magnetizations (Fig. 2): 88 K, 127 K, and 178 K. In the pulsed mode, these
operating temperatures have relative sensitivities to the electron edm of −0.4, 1, and −0.3

respectively, producing an easily discriminated temperature signature.

Induction pulses can be seen on the electrodes during the application and removal of H.

These induction voltages reverse with the polarity of H. However, unlike the edm, these

5

voltage reversals are symmetric between the two electrodes. Memory of these induction

voltages through the charging of capacitors in the detector produces oﬀset voltages that can

obscure the edm voltage. The voltage oﬀset produced by this memory goes as the temporal

area of the pulse (V-s) divided by the relevant RC time (s). The oﬀset is eﬀectively reduced

in the AC coupling of the ampliﬁer by increasing R during the induction pulses. A similar

eﬀect on the JFET input is reduced to an acceptable level by keeping the detector input
impedance high (1013 Ω).

We construct a voltage “asymmetry” by taking the diﬀerence between the observed volt-

ages for opposing circulations of the applied H. We construct “asymmetries” for each
electrode (A and B) and for the diﬀerence (D = A − B). The edm voltage should manifest

as an asymmetry in D. A plot of the diﬀerence asymmetry as a function of temperature is

shown in ﬁgure 4. These data are acquired in “square wave” mode with applied ﬁelds of

53 Oe. Also shown is the expected edm signal based on the anticipated orientation of the

Gd ions at various temperatures. A large eﬀect is seen which mimics the edm signature at

low temperatures. However, unlike the expected edm signal, this asymmetry remains large

at temperatures above 180 K. We believe that this asymmetry is produced by the imperfect

reversal of a much larger quadratic magnetic ﬁeld eﬀect.

To investigate this, we monitor the electrode voltages and the sample magnetization as

a function of the applied ﬁeld H, which is varied using a triangular wave. We construct the

symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of these signals by adding or subtracting the signals that

are one half of a period out of phase. Transient induction pulses due to dB/dt appear clearly

in the anti-symmetric parts of all of the signals. The anti-symmetric part of the voltages

on the electrodes are well correlated in time and magnitude with the current induced in a

pick-up coil wrapped around the sample on the outside of the Faraday cage. The symmetric

parts of the electrode signals are shown in ﬁgure 5. The symmetric voltage changes are

large. They rise rapidly with the reversal of the sample magnetization and then fall oﬀ
roughly as H −1 at higher ﬁelds. We refer to this eﬀect as the “M even” eﬀect. Unlike the

anti-symmetric parts of the signals, this curve is not appreciably modiﬁed by changing the

frequency of the triangle wave, further indicating that the symmetric part of the voltage is

not induced by dB/dt.

As a function of temperature, the diﬀerence asymmetries are signiﬁcantly correlated with

the amplitudes of the M even voltages. This suggests that the diﬀerence asymmetries may

of one of the “C”s to be reliable. In these regions the magnetic moment of one of the “C”s is too

small and domain creep follows the reversal of the applied ﬁeld.

be due to imperfect reversal (perhaps due to local pinning of magnetic domains) of the much

larger M even eﬀect. Higher ﬁelds suppress the size of the M even voltage (Fig. 5) and may

also result in an improved reversal of the eﬀect due to suppression of domain pinning. To

achieve higher ﬁelds without excessive heating we switch to the “pulsed” mode of data

acquisition. The observed diﬀerence asymmetry appears to decrease to some asymptotic

value as the ﬁeld strength increases.

We use the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to ﬁt the high ﬁeld pulsed diﬀerence asym-

metries to the asymptotic functional form V = b/H + V0, where b and V0 are constants.

Only values of H larger than 125 Oe are included in the ﬁt. This high-ﬁeld asymptotic

form is suggested by studies of the approach to saturation of the magnetic domains in poly-

crystalline YIG [19] and selected because of the high quality of the resulting ﬁt. Several
data scans are taken at each temperature. The values of b vary between about −1.3 and
−1.9 mV-Oe, depending on the temperature. The averaged oﬀsets (V0) obtained from the
ﬁts are V 88K

of our electrodes corresponds to a charge of about 8 electrons. Application of the theory of

Ref. 16 to our sample allows us to infer from Vedm a measurement of the electron edm of
(2 ± 3) × 10−24 e-cm.

Systematic eﬀects associated with capacitive pickup, external magnetic ﬁelds, circuit

memory of the induction pulses, and domain creep have all been considered and are found

to be negligible at our present level of sensitivity. The result is limited by our ability to

reliably extract the asymptotic values of V0. The large size of the M even eﬀect and the

sensitivity of V0 to the experimental conﬁguration and chosen asymptotic form make this

particularly diﬃcult. Nonetheless, our result does establish an upper bound on the electron
edm, de < 5 × 10−24 e-cm, a factor of forty lower than the previous best value obtained from

a solid-state system. However, this bound remains more than 3 orders of magnitude larger

than the best atomic limit.

Further improvement upon this limit in a solid will require dramatic suppression of the

M even eﬀect. We are presently engaged in an investigation of the source of this eﬀect.

While a voltage with this symmetry can be produced by diﬀerential magnetostriction, the

8

observed eﬀect is more than an order of magnitude larger than theoretical upper bounds

on its size [20]. In addition, unlike magnetostriction, the observed eﬀect does not have an

extremum at zero magnetization, but appears to peak during the rotation mode (mode III)

of the magnetization process (Ref. 15). This suggests that the source of the voltage may be

related to the relative angle between the net magnetization and the easy axis of the various

crystallites. The functional dependence of the M even eﬀect is consistent with a voltage
proportional to M(Msat −M), where the voltage is referenced to zero at Msat, the saturation
magnetization. Indeed, in the high ﬁeld limit this expression approaches M 2
sata/H, where
a is the magnetic hardness of the sample (Ref. 19). This H −1 dependence matches our

observed high ﬁeld behavior. We are presently investigating the dependence of the M even

eﬀect on the polycrystalline nature of the sample, the toroidal geometry, and the relative

proportions of Gd to Y. Depending on the outcome of these investigations a single crystal

sample, a change in geometry or doping, or an entirely diﬀerent crystal (e.g. LiGdF4) may

be necessary to adequately suppress this eﬀect.

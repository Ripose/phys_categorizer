We combine a limited number of accurately measured transition frequencies in hydrogen and deuterium,
recent quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations, and, as an essential additional ingredient, a generalized
least-squares analysis, to obtain precise and optimal predictions for hydrogen and deuterium transition frequen-
cies. Some of the predicted transition frequencies have relative uncertainties more than an order of magnitude
smaller than that of the g-factor of the electron, which was previously the most accurate prediction of QED.

PACS numbers: 12.20.Ds, 31.30.Jv, 06.20.Jr, 31.15.-p

In the past decade there have been signiﬁcant advances in
both the measurement and theory of transition frequencies in
hydrogen and deuterium. With the advent of frequency-comb
metrology, the progress in measurements has accelerated to
the extent that the uncertainty in the experimental value of the
1S–2S frequency in hydrogen has decreased by three orders
of magnitude in about ten years [1]. Many other precision
measurements of transitions in hydrogen and deuterium with
principal quantum number n up to 12 have been made and are
listed in Table I, together with the 1S–2S frequency [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In addition, precise measurements have
been made involving states of hydrogen with n = 27 to 30
[11]. Further advances may be anticipated from a number of
groups currently working to improve measurement accuracy
[12, 13, 14, 15].

On the theoretical side, there has been progress in the accu-
racy of quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations which
has led to a signiﬁcant reduction of the uncertainty of both the
one-photon [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] and two-photon [21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26] contributions. In addition to this progress, the ap-
plication of the least-squares method described here makes it
possible in some cases to predict transition frequencies with
a relative uncertainty that is more than an order of magnitude
smaller than the relative uncertainty in the Rydberg constant,
which is 6.6 × 10−12.

It is of interest to have accurate calculations of hydrogen
and deuterium transition frequencies for comparison to exist-
ing and new experimental values, for both frequency standards
applications, and as tests of QED. Also, with sufﬁciently ac-
curate theory available, it would be possible to consider re-
deﬁning the SI second in terms of an assigned value of the
Rydberg constant. Although this would entail about three or-
ders of magnitude improvement in the theory, the recent rate
of progress suggests that it may be within reach.

In this letter, we give theoretical values for a number of
transition frequencies that are meant to be best values consis-
tent with currently available experimental and theoretical in-
formation. Such calculated values for the transitions in Table I
follow from the results of the 2002 CODATA least-squares ad-

justment of the fundamental constants [27, 28, 29], and are
listed in that table. Of course, the calculated value of the
1S–2S transition in hydrogen should not be viewed as a theo-
retical prediction, because the least-squares adjustment deter-
mines values of the adjusted constants (variables or unknowns
of the adjustment) so that the calculated frequency is essen-
tially equal to the very precise measured value. The number
in parentheses with each value is the standard uncertainty (es-
timated standard deviation) in the last two ﬁgures. Hyperﬁne
structure effects are not included in the quoted numbers.

For hydrogen or deuterium transition frequencies not in-
cluded in the 2002 adjustment, we proceed as follows. The
energy level Ei of state i can be written as a function of
the fundamental constants and an additional adjusted con-
stant δi which takes into account the uncertainty in the theory
[27, 30, 31]. For example, for the case in which i is a state of
hydrogen, we have

Ei = Hi

R∞, α, Ar(e), Ar(p), Rp

+ δi,

(1)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

where the constants that appear as arguments of the function
Hi are listed in Table II. Because the values of the constants in
Eq. (1), including δi, result from a least-squares adjustment,
they are correlated, particularly those for R∞ and Rp, which
have a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.996. The uncertainty of
the calculated value for the 1S–2S frequency in hydrogen is
increased by a factor of about 500 if such correlations are ne-
glected. The function Hi also depends implicitly on c and the
Planck constant h. However, these constants are not displayed
as variables, because c is a ﬁxed number, and the frequencies
(Ei − Ei′ )/h are essentially independent of h. Levels in deu-
terium are given as similar functions with p replaced by d.

The theory included in the function Hi in Eq. (1) is de-
scribed in detail in Appendix A of Ref. [27], which provides
a review of the relevant calculations. Much of that informa-
tion is in the form of equations that are valid for any state,
with the exception of tables of data that only have entries for
the levels included in the 2002 CODATA adjustment. En-
larged versions of those tables with data for all states with
n ≤ 200 are available on the NIST Physics Laboratory Web

site at physics.nist.gov/hdel. Estimates of the theoretical un-
certainties of the function Hi, represented by the constant δi
in Eq. (1), are also given in Appendix A of Ref. [27]. The a
priori estimated value of δi is δi(th) = 0, because the the-
oretical expression for the levels includes all known contri-
butions. However, the estimated uncertainty u[δi(th)] is not
zero, and there are signiﬁcant covariances between the vari-
ous δs that take into account the expected patterns in the un-
certainties. For example, for S states there are components
of uncertainty with the functional form C/n3, where C is a
common unknown constant, and there are components of un-
certainty common to hydrogen and deuterium levels with the
same quantum numbers. The theoretical uncertainties and co-
variances are included in the least-squares adjustment as input

A generalized least-squares adjustment is formulated here
along the lines described in Refs. [29] and [28]. Symbols that
refer to data used in the 2002 CODATA adjustment of the con-
stants are also deﬁned in Ref. [28]. New energy levels El to
be determined are added to the adjustment, along with the cor-
responding theoretical expressions of the form in Eq. (1), and
for each added level not among those in Table I, a new ad-
justed variable δl is added. The updated column vector of
input data Qu, matrix of their covariances Vu, and column
vector of variables Zu are written in block form as

Qu = 

where Q, V , and Z are the corresponding sets of quantities
used in the 2002 least-squares adjustment, Qδ is the set of
theoretical data δl(th) = 0 for the new variables δl, Zδ is the
new set of adjusted variables δl, and QE is input data for the
new energy levels El. In Vu, where Vuik = cov(Qui, Quk),
S and T are the sets of theoretical covariances involving the
new δs, and VE is the set of covariances of the new levels
El. Since the input data for the new levels are unknown, we
simply assume that the uncertainties are very large and that
there are no correlations among them or with the rest of the
input data. This yields the blocks of zeros in Vu and results in

VE being diagonal.

of observational equations given by

where the dot over the equal sign indicates that the equa-
tion represents the ideal relations between the input data and
the adjusted constants which are not simultaneously satisﬁed,
since the set of equations is overdetermined. In Eq. (3), F is
the set of functions in the observational equations of the 2002
adjustment, and E is the set of expressions for the new energy
levels of the form in Eq. (1). The observational equations are
linearized by writing the Taylor series

and neglecting higher-order terms. In Eq. (5), A is the ma-
trix of derivatives from the 2002 adjustment, I is the identity
matrix, and B and C are derivatives of the new energy levels
with respect to the old and new variables, respectively. The
truncated expression in Eq. (4) corresponds to

Eqs. (12) and (16) show that both the values and uncertain-
ties of the new levels being calculated are inﬂuenced by their
covariances with the levels in the 2002 least-squares adjust-
ment, while the values and uncertainties of the variables from
that adjustment are not changed at all. Also, since the only
adjusted variables that change in the update appear linearly in
Eq. (3), no iteration of the update is needed to reach the ﬁnal
result.

Examples of calculated transition frequencies in hydrogen
and deuterium based on this update, starting from the results
of the 2002 least-squares adjustment, are given in Tables III
and IV. Data from that adjustment needed for such a calcu-
lation are available on the Web at physics.nist.gov/constants.
The frequencies in Tables III and IV all have relative uncer-
tainties that are smaller than the relative uncertainty of the
Rydberg constant, mainly as a result of the correlations be-
tween R∞, Rp, and Rd. In some cases, these values are nearly
ﬁve orders of magnitude more accurate than the correspond-
ing best previous values [34]. A database that gives the fre-
quency of any transition between levels with n ≤ 200 based
on the calculations described here is maintained on the Web
at physics.nist.gov/hdel.

Helpful conversations with G. W. Stewart are acknowl-

edged by one of the authors (PJM).

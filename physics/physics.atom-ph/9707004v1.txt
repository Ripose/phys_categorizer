Abstract

We treat the interaction of a trapped ion with a standing-wave light ﬁeld relax-
ing the previous condition of the trapping ion being on the node of the standing

wave. In addition we work to second order in the Lamb-Dicke parameter η, the
extension to higher orders in η is also indicated. Only a simple transformation
to the “dressed basis” [subject to the constraint of Pauli algebra] is required

in order to show that the ion interacting with a standing light-wave may be
described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian.

Field theories in particle physics of spin one-half fermions [matter ﬁelds] interacting

with spin-one vector bosons [force ﬁelds] subject to the principle of local gauge invariance

have been very successful in fundamental processes. The familiar examples are quantum

electrodynamics [QED], quantum chromodynamics [QCD] and quantum ﬂavorodynamics

[QFD]. QED the theory of electrically charged spin one-half fermions interacting with mass-

less spin one photons is remarkably precise in predicting physical quantities up to 15 decimal

places. The quantum corrections up to several loop orders in QED precisely and beautifully

ﬁt the experimental data.

In the context of quantum optics the Jaynes-Cummings model is a favorite among the-

orists and experimentalists. As is well-known when we consider a quantum two-level system

interacting with a single mode of quantized ﬁeld one is led to the familiar Jaynes-Cummings

Hamiltonian [JCH] [1] provided one is interested only in the diﬀerence of the population of

the two levels. The JCH has been extensively used as a model Hamiltonian in ﬁelds such as

quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance, and quantum electronics. It is well-known that

a two-level system interacting with a single mode of radiation is mathematically equivalent

to spin one-half system interacting with the a single mode of radiation. It appears that of

authors Yang et al., [2] seem to overlook the fact that this similarity between JC model and

one describing a spin- 1

2 particle in a magnetic ﬁeld is well-known, to quote them [2] “We now

establish the similarity between JC model and one describing a spin- 1

2 particle in a magnetic

ﬁeld.” A compact method/notation to solve various nonlinear extensions of the JCH will be

reported elsewhere [3].

An interesting study of the JCH is the periodic spontaneous collapse and revival due

to quantum granularity of the ﬁeld [4]. In the rotating wave approximation [RWA], the JCH

becomes solvable and it has been broadly used in the last years [5–10]. There are many other

interesting works on the JCH.

2

A question that naturally arises is, why is the JCH so successful and rich in predictions?

An answer could be that it is the simplest Hamiltonian one can write for spin-half system

interacting with a single mode of quantized ﬁeld and thus covers a whole spectrum of natural

phenomena, since as already mentioned it seems that we can formulate a large class of

successful quantum theories based on the interaction of spin one-half ﬁelds interacting with

spin one ﬁelds. Exploiting the general structure of spin one-half system interacting with

radiation ﬁeld by using well-known results a compact method/notation has been developed

to solve various nonlinear extensions of the JCH [3]. For example in the present note by

demanding that the transformed dressed matrices obey the Pauli algebra we are able to

demonstrate the correspondence of trapped ion dynamics interacting with a standing-wave

light ﬁeld to the JCH.

One can also attempt to solve Hamiltonians using the mathematics of Supersymmetry

[SUSY]. Although SUSY still awaits experimental veriﬁcation in the context of particle

physics nevertheless one is free to use SUSY as a mathematical tool to solve various physical

problems. In particular SUSY quantum mechanics has proved quite useful in the solution of

various problems, see [11] for a review. One example of SUSY quantum mechanics at work

is the exact supersymmetry in nonrelativistic hydrogen atom considered by Tangerman and

Tjon [11], there are many others. Solutions of the JCH and its extensions using SUSY will

be reported elsewhere [12].

The Hamiltonian of the trapped ion interacting with a standing wave where the trap-

ping ion is on the node of the standing wave to ﬁrst order in the Lamb-Dicke parameter η was

given by Cirac et al.,. [13]. It was shown in [13] that the dynamics of the laser cooled two-

level trapped ion is described by the JCH. The analogy established in [13] between trapped

ion dynamics and cavity QED is an important one and has resulted in many proposals/ideas

for example quantum non-demolition measurement of ﬁnal temperature [14,15], experimen-

3

tal study of collapse and revivals [16] and theoretical studies of the same [17,13,18]. One

intuitively expects that the dynamics of the ion away from the node will also be described by

JCH. The main purpose of this note is to extend the result of [13] by allowing the trapped

ion to be anywhere [not just the node] on the standing-wave light ﬁeld. Recently Wu and

Yang [19] [see Note added] have also attempted to extend the work of [13]. In their analysis

[19] they introduce the interaction picture which is not necessary as is clear from our work.

More precisely the use of interaction picture in our approach is not needed in the context

of establishing a correspondence between trapped two-level ion interacting with a standing-

wave light ﬁeld and JCH. One simply needs to use the transformation to the dressed basis

to establish the correspondence between the trapped ion interacting with the standing-wave

light ﬁeld and JCH. The particular form of the transformation is determined by imposing

the condition that algebra of Pauli matrices be maintained. Moreover we go beyond the ﬁrst

order in η and point out that by keeping second and higher order terms in η we are lead to

the multi-photon or m-photon JCH [20–23]. The master equation of a single two-level ion

trapped in a harmonic potential and located at the node of standing-wave light ﬁeld is [13],

where ∆ is the detuning of the two-level transition from the laser frequency, ν is the trap

frequency, Ω0 is the laser Rabi frequency, and η = πa0/λ is the Lamb-Dicke parameter with

a0 the amplitude of the ground state of the trap and λ the optical wavelength. a† and a are

the creation and destruction operators for phonons respectively. The σi’s i = x, y, z are usual

Pauli matrices [4] with σ± = 1

2 (σx ± iσy), the raising and lowering operators for the two-level

system. We note the familiar relations governing σ’s i.e. {σi, σj} = δij, [σi, σj] = 2iǫijkσk,

i, j = x, y, z. ˜ρ does not concern us here and is deﬁned in [13]. As mentioned in [13] it

accounts for the momentum transfer associated with spontaneous emission of a photon.

The Hamiltonian for the single two-level ion trapped in a harmonic potential and

located at the node of a standing-wave light ﬁeld is easily read from Eq. 1, one has

H = ¯hνa†a + ¯h

σz − ¯h

(σ+ + σ−) sin[η(a + a†)].

We note that the population occupation operators are deﬁned in the usual manner σ22−σ11 =

σz and σ22 + σ11 = 1 or alternatively σ22 = 1

2 (1 + σz), and σ11 = 1

2(1 − σz).

It is straightforward to extend Eq. 2 to the case when the ion is not necessarily on

the node by letting − sin[η(a + a†)] → − sin[π/2] sin[η(a + a†)] → cos[η(a + a†) + π/2] →

cos[η(a + a†) + χ]. We thus obtain the Hamiltonian for the trapped ion in a harmonic

potential and located anywhere on a standing-wave light ﬁeld,

H = ¯hνa†a + ¯h

σz + ¯h

(σ+ + σ−) cos[η(a + a†) + χ],

We can write cos[η(a + a†) + χ] = cos[η(a + a†)] cos χ − sin[η(a + a†)] sin χ and expand Eq. 4

in powers of the Dicke parameter η to obtain,

H = ¯hνa†a + ¯h

For the moment ignoring the term of order η2 and using the deﬁnition/relation of σ+ + σ− =

where in the last line we have gone to the usual RWA. We have gone to the RWA since we

want to compare our Hamiltonian to the JCH which is usually written using RWA. In order

5

to cast Eq. 5 into the JC form we can combine the second and third terms in Eq. 5 into a

single term by deﬁning the transformation

We note that Σ2

z = 1. Using 6 in Eq. 5 we can write the latter as

In order to have a consistent Pauli algebra between the Σ matrices we must supplement Σz

in 6 by Σx and Σy where

which are/[can be] found/determined after some simple algebra. For example a simple way

to determine Σx is to assume that its is some arbitrary linear combination of σx and σz

and then determine the coeﬃcients appearing in the linear combination by using the fact

that {Σz, Σx} = 0. It is easily checked that Σ2

x = 1, Σ2

y = 1, {Σx, Σy} = 0, {Σy, Σz} = 0

{Σz, Σx} = 0, [Σx, Σy] = 2iΣz, [Σy, Σz] = 2iΣx, and [Σz, Σx] = 2iΣy. These relations can

be summarized or put into the usual compact notation namely {Σi, Σj} = δij, [Σi, Σj] =

2iǫijkΣk, i, j = x, y, z, we thus have a consistent Pauli algebra.

Using Eq. 8 we may rewrite Eq. 7 completely in terms of Σ’s, viz

we see a direct correspondence. In particular by making the identiﬁcations ν ↔ ωf , Ω ↔ ω0,

and g ↔ η Ω0

∆
Ω sin χ we immediately see that there is a direct correspondence between the

two-level trapped ion interacting with a standing-wave light ﬁeld and the familiar JCH. The

eﬀective coupling η Ω0

∆
Ω sin χ is dependent on the Rabi frequency and can be adjusted in

experiments. It is clear that Eq. 9 reduces in the special case of the ion at the node [i.e.

setting χ = π/2] to the previous result [13].

Going back to Eq. 4 we see that the second-order term in η corresponds in the RWA

approximation to the two-photon term in the m-photon JCH [20,21,23]. The higher-order

terms in η will similarly correspond to the multi-photon terms in the m-photon JCH.

One can see that the ﬂuorescence spectrum without including the decay rate will consist

of three peaks as noted in [13], in our case the three peaks will be centered at ν = 0, ±Ω

with Ω given in 6, we note that our Ω0 corresponds to Ω in [13]. If the decay rate is included

Ω will be changed to something like Ω =

∆2 + Ω2

0 cos2 χ + c Γ2, where c is a constant. It

q

is claimed that c = 5 in [19], however we have not checked this.

In conclusion:

• We have treated the interaction of a trapped ion with standing-wave light ﬁeld relaxing

the previous condition that the trapping ion remain on the node of the standing-wave

[13]. It has been shown here that the two-level trapped ion dynamics both oﬀ and on

the node is described by JCH .

• Our analysis relies on a transformation to the dressed basis, the transformation in

turn is determined by demanding that the Pauli algebra should hold between the

transformed matrices.

7

• We have also shown/indicated that by going to higher orders i.e. beyond ﬁrst order in

Lamb-Dicke parameter η we are lead to the m-photon JCH.

One could use the well-established ﬁeld of ion trapping as a testing ground for strongly

coupled QED because for a trapped ion the coupling parameters can be varied by laser ﬁeld

strength. The ability to control/vary the coupling is an attractive feature of the trapped ion

system.

Note added: We recently noticed the work by Wu and Yang [19] which also deals with the

extension of [13]. However during the course of their analysis they go to the interaction

picture and in the end drop the time-dependences.

In contrast our approach is based on

maintaining the algebra of Pauli matrices after the transformation to the “dressed basis”.

And hence the use of interaction picture in our approach is not needed in the context of

establishing a correspondence between trapped two-level ion interacting with a standing-

wave light ﬁeld and JCH.

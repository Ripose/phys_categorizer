Abstract

A new method for measuring a possible time dependence of the ﬁne-structure

constant (α) is proposed. The method is based on the level-crossing in two-

electron highly-charged ions facilitating resonance laser measurements of the

distance between the levels at the point of crossing. This provides an en-

hancement factor of about 103 in Helium-like Europium and thus reduces the

requirements for the relative accuracy of resonance laser measurements at

about 10−12.

Questions about the constancy of fundamental coupling and mass parameters in physics,

ﬁrst addressed by Dirac [1], now become of particular interest in connection with new

developments towards uniﬁed ﬁeld theories, such as string theories, D-brane models, etc.

These theories, in principle, allow for a space and time dependence of fundamental con-

stants (see Ref. [2] for a comprehensive review on the subject). Presently, the situation

regarding this problem appears to be very stringent, since spectroscopical studies of the

spectra of quasars indicated a deviation of the ﬁne-structure constant from its standard

value of about ∆α/α = (

Within this paper we propose a new type of atomic experiments for the search for varia-

tions of the ﬁne-structure constant employing the crossings of atomic levels as a function of

the nuclear charge number Z in two-electron highly-charged ions (HCI). These energy levels

including QED corrections were recently evaluated with high accuracy in [7]. The eﬀect of

the possible time-variation of α becomes strongly enhanced when it is investigated close to

such crossing points.

We consider the energy diﬀerence ∆E between two energy levels in Helium-like HCI as

a function of the two parameters α and Z, respectively. Accurate calculation of the energy

levels within the framework of QED should account for a number of energy corrections

2

corresponding to various eﬀects.

In terms of these corrections the function ∆E can be

represented as the sum

∆E(α, Z) = ∆ENS(Z) + ∆E1ph(α, Z) + ∆ESE+VP(α, Z) + ∆E2ph(α, Z) + ∆EScr(SE+VP)(α, Z) , (1)

where the nuclear-size correction is of order α0.

In the following, we shall focus on the

two-electron levels (1s, 2s) and (1s, 2p), respectively. In case of a point nucleus the Dirac

energies of 2s- and 2p-states are equal, correspondingly, ﬁnite-nuclear size induces a shift

∆ENS which is supposed to be independent on α. The contributions ∆E1ph and ∆E2ph refer

to one- and two-photon exchange corrections, respectively. The term ∆ESE+VP represents

the sum of the ﬁrst-order (one-electron) self-energy (SE) and vacuum-polarization (VP)

corrections. Finally, the term ∆EScr(SE+VP) denotes the corresponding screening corrections.

Each individual energy shift can be decomposed into a power series with respect to α and

Z with coeﬃcients C correction

powers of α,Z. Accordingly, the one-photon exchange correction is taken

into account up to terms

∆E1ph(α, Z) = C 1ph

0,1 Z + C 1ph

2,3 α2Z 3 + C 1ph

4,5 α4Z 5 .

The one-loop radiative eﬀects are proportional to Z(αZ)3

∆ESE+VP(α, Z) = C SE+VP

α3Z 4 .

3,4

In comparison with ∆E1ph the two-photon exchange correction ∆E2ph is smaller by one

factor of Z. Accordingly, it can be expanded up to terms O(α5Z 5)

∆E2ph(α, Z) = C 2ph

0,0 + C 2ph

2,2 α2Z 2 + C 2ph

4,4 α4Z 4 .

The last term in Eq. (1) is a two-photon correction which accounts for the eﬀect of screening

of SE and VP

∆EScr(SE+VP)(α, Z) = C Scr(SE+VP)

α3Z 3 .

3,3

While the terms proportional to C 1ph

0,1 and C 2ph

0,0 correspond to the pure Coulomb in-

teraction between the two electrons, the terms with coeﬃcients C 1ph

An estimate for the logarithmic derivative ˙α/α, measured in the units of yr−1, follows

from the measurement of the quantity on the left-hand side of Eq. (7). Recent atomic

measurements can provide bounds at the level of accuracy 10−15yr−1, as stated above.

In view of Eq. (7) and assuming that the value ∆E(α, Z) almost tends to zero at some

value of Z (crossing-point), we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcient

plays the role of an enhancement factor when extracting the value for ˙α/α provided the

left-hand side of Eq. (7) is known. Indeed, diﬀerentiating ∆E(α, Z) we ﬁnd

η = (∆E)−1α

where Z0 (in general, a real number) would correspond to the exact crossing point.

Note, that for ions the equality (9) holds only approximately, since the nuclear charge

number Z takes integer values, only. Nevertheless, the cancellation of diﬀerent terms in the

expression for ∆E(α, Z0) can reduce its value by several orders of magnitude, while such a

cancellation does not occur in Eq. (10). For Z = 66 the energy diﬀerence ∆E21S0−23P0(α, Z)

4

6
in two-electron ions reduces to 0.016eV, while the individual terms in Eq. (1) contributing

to Eq. (10) are of the order 102eV. Thus, we can expect a value for the enhancement factor

η of the order 103 (see [7]).

It should be emphasized, that in order to make use of this almost level crossing, one

has to be able to measure directly the energy diﬀerence ∆E(α, Z), otherwise the gain of

the enhancement factor 103 will be lost by the requirement to measure the positions of

each of the crossing levels with an accuracy better by 3 order of magnitude. Fortunately,

such direct measurements are feasible when applying laser techniques for the spectroscopy

of HCI. Energy diﬀerences of the order of 1eV

0.1eV correspond to the optical or infrared

−

frequency intervals. A number of experiments with lasers has already been performed for

measurements of hyperﬁne-structure intervals in HCI, which lay in the optical region [8,9].

To become sensitive to temporal variations of

˙α/α at the level of 10−15yr−1 in laser

experiments with HCI performed during a time interval δt about 1yr, it will require a

relative accuracy in the measurement of the energy diﬀerence of the order 10−12. Here we

have taken into account the enhancement factor 103. In principle, this accuracy could be

achieved in laser resonant measurements. In particular, the two-photon transition for 1s-2s

states in hydrogen has been measured with a relative accuracy of about 10−14 [10]. Such

a level of precision has not yet been reached in experiments with HCI. Nevertheless, as a

precondition of any experiments theory should provide most accurate values for ∆E(α, Z)

although the goal to achieve an experimental accuracy of 10−12 is still far beyond present

abilities. In laser resonance measurements in neutral atoms the theoretical accuracy is much

poorer than the experimental one. This is a usual situation, which should not be considered

as a hindrance for the search of a temporal variation of α in HCI.

Let us consider in more detail the crossing of the levels 21S0 and 23P0 in two-electron ion

with nuclear charge number Z = 66. Since the one-photon 0

0 transition is forbidden, one

−

should either investigate transitions between the hyperﬁne sublevels in the isotopes with the

nonzero nuclear spin or look for the two photon E1M1 resonance. The E1M1 transitions
23P0 −

11S0 in two-electron HCI were studied in Ref. [11–13]. We should stress that the

For each of the corrections Eqs. (2-5) the corresponding values for the coeﬃcients

The relatively large values for the coeﬃcients C 2ph indicate the poor convergence of the

series expansion (4). This does not mean, however, the inaccuracy in the result. One has

to remember that the coeﬃcients in (11) are obtained from the numerical all-order in αZ

calculation and the poor convergence of αZ expansion for any correction in the left-hand

side of Eq. (11) does not inﬂuence our conclusions. The ﬁt of the exact numerical function

by the few αZ expansion terms for the ﬁxed value of Z (in our case Z = 66) can be done

as accurate as necessary and only the large values of the coeﬃcients for C 2ph correction

compared to expansion coeﬃcients to other corrections are puzzling. The minimum value

for the total energy shift at Z = 66 turns out to be ∆E(α, Z) =

The feasibility of the proposed experiment depends crucially on whether tunable lasers

within the frequency range of about 0.01

120µm are available.

In particular, the Free Electron Lasers (FELs) satisfy these

conditions, though they do not provide the required relative accuracy 10−12. In particular,

the Forschungzentrum Rossendorf (Dresden) provides ELBE FELs [15] with wavelengths λ =

3

25µm and it is supposed to reach the region λ = 20

150µm. Alternative methods may

E.g. CO2 lasers have typical wavelengths in the region of about 10.6µm. Consider an ion

with relativistic factor γ = 1/√1

β2 colliding head-on with a photon of frequency ωlab in
the laboratory frame. In the ions rest frame the frequency ω is given by ω = γ(1 + β)ωlab.
The recent GSI ESR facility provides γ = 1.048 and up to γ = 23 at the new projected

GSI storage ring [16]. Manipulating between these two values one can cover the range of

λ

wavelengths 10.6µm

488µm. The same concerns tunable semiconductor-diode laser

of exciting the levels under consideration via absorption of n photons of frequency ω such

−

that ∆E = nω (multiphoton resonance) [17,18]. Finally, we mention that the optical mixing

techniques [19] can also help to achieve radiation sources with wavelengths within the range

1

100µm.

−

The most severe problem which arises when performing the proposed experiment is how

to achieve the required accuracy 10−12 in case of the broad resonances. As mentioned

above the width of the 21S0 -23P0 resonance in a He-like ion with Z = 66 is about 1012s−1.

Accordingly, the problem consists in the observation of time-dependence derivation of natural

line proﬁle. The latter is characterized by the maximum frequency ωmax and the width Γ.

Although the value ωmax may not coincide with ∆E [20] it exhibits the same enhancement

behaviour due temporal variation of α. Thus, one has to concentrate on the measurement of

ωmax, which, in principle, appears as a question of statistics. Suppose that the measurement

occurs in the vicinity of ωmax within the laser bandwidth that is assumed to be much smaller

than Γ. Then each photon absorption can be considered as statistical “event”, or elementary

7

act of measurement. An accuracy r = 10−12 implies to register r−2 = 1024 “events”.

The required intensity of the laser beam may be estimated according to the formula
r−2 = T NionσIph. Here T denotes the time duration of the laser experiment (e.g. even
107s may be still realistic), Iph is the photon ﬂux (in units photons/s) and Nion is
T = 3
the number of ions, meeting the laser beam per second. The latter value may be estimated

×

according to Nion = NtotNrev, where Ntot = 108/0.01 cm2 is the total number of the ions
in the storage ring (assuming a beam diameter of about 0.1cm) and Nrev is the number

of revolutions per second. A rough estimate for the photon-absorption cross-section σ is

provided by σ

(a0)2/Z 2, where a0 is the Bohr radius. For Z = 66 this yields about

10−20cm2. Taking all together one obtains the necessary laser beam intensity of the

order Iph ≃
mind ﬁrst, that the future GSI facilities will provide an ion beam being more intensive by

1020photon/s. Although this is a very huge number one should keep in

×

3

several orders of magnitude and second, that the progress in laser techniques has been very

fast during the last years.

Very stringent, in principle, is also the problem with Doppler broadening. The latter

is deﬁned by the expression ΓD = γβ(∆v/v)ωlab. While the natural broadening is time-
translational invariant the Doppler broadening depends on the beam temperature, which

can also vary during the time period T . Fortunately, the Doppler broadening appears to be
smaller than the natural one in case of 21S0 −
velocity spread in the beam is given by ∆v/v

23P0 transition. According to [21] the relative
10−4ωlab,
i.e. much smaller than Γ. Once the problem with the natural broadening will be solved, the

Doppler broadening problem will be solved as well.

It should be mentioned, that similar atomic experiments utilizing levels crossing with

both HCI and neutral atoms in the presence of an external magnetic or electric ﬁeld can

also be proposed. However, the reliability of such experiments will strongly depend on the

constancy of the strength of the external ﬁelds during the time interval δt

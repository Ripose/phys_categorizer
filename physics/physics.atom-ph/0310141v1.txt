A ﬁnite-ﬁeld scaling method is applied to evaluate the Lennard-Jones interaction constant C3 for
alkali-metal atoms. The calculations are based on the relativistic single-double (SD) approximation
in which single and double excitations of Dirac-Hartree-Fock wave functions are included to all
orders in perturbation theory.

INTRODUCTION

The long-range interaction between an atom and a per-
fectly conducting wall is governed by the Lennard-Jones
[1] static image potential

V (z) = −

e2C3
z3

,

(1)

where z is the distance between the atom and the wall.
The coeﬃcient C3 in Eq. (1) is the expectation value of
the operator

16 Xi,j

(xixj + yiyj + 2zizj) ,

in the atomic ground state. Here, ri = (xi, yi, zi) is
the coordinate of the i-th atomic electron with respect
to the nucleus. For an atom with a spherically symmet-
ric ground state, one can replace C3 by the equivalent
expression

C3 =

i ri. The Lennard-Jones interaction con-
where R =
stant is important in models accounting for the ﬁnite con-
ductivity of the wall material by Bardeen [2] and Mavroy-
annis [3]. Additionally, the wall-atom-wall interaction
constant for small wall separation distances is propor-
tional to C3 [4, 5].

Precise values of C3 for lithium were obtained by Yan
and Drake [6] from an elaborate conﬁguration interaction

(CI) calculation and conﬁrmed by an independent calcu-
lation by Yan et al. [4]. The CI value of C3 for lithium
is in close agreement with the value inferred from a vari-
ational calculation by King [7]. These accurate values
of C3 for lithium are about 2% smaller than the value
obtained from a Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation.

An accurate semi-empirical value of C3 for sodium was
also obtained by Kharchenko et al. [5] from an analysis
of the S−1 sum rule:

S−1 =

hR2i =

2
3

fn
E0 − En

,

Xn

where fn is the oscillator strength of the transition from
the ground state to an excited state n. The quantities
E0 and En are energies of the ground state and excited
state, respectively. This value diﬀers from the HF value
of C3 by about 10%. The more elaborate calculations
by Per J¨onsson et al. [8] improve the agreement between
theoretical and semi-empirical values for sodium some-
what.

Third-order many-body perturbation theory calcula-
tions of C3 for all alkali-metal atoms and all-order singles-
doubles calculations of C3 for Li, Na, and K were given
by Derevianko et al. [9]. The all-order calculations for Li
and Na were in close agreement with with other precise
values. More recently, Derevianko et al. [10] deduced ac-
curate theoretical and semi-empirical values of C3 for all
alkali-metal atoms from oscillator-strength sum rules.

R2

In the present work, we use ﬁnite-ﬁeld many-body
methods to obtain values of
and make compar-
isons with previous work. One advantage of the ﬁnite
ﬁeld-method is that all-order random-phase approxima-
tion (RPA) corrections are included from the start. A
second advantage is that n-th order corrections to the en-
ergy give many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) cor-
rections to matrix elements of R2 normally associated
with order (n+1). A third advantage is that matrix ele-
ments of one- and two-particle operators are essentially
trivial to obtain, in contrast to the lengthy calculations

ordinarily required.

is known as the “ﬁnite-ﬁeld” method and widely used in
quantum chemistry. We evaluate the ground-state expec-
tation value of the operator by adding the scalar operator
λR2 to the many-electron Hamiltonian and calculating
the resulting energy E(λ). The desired expectation value
is then given by

We consider an atom with one electron beyond closed
shells. The core and valence energies are given at the HF
level of approximation by

where the summation index a ranges over closed shells,
and where ǫv is the eigenvalue of the valence “frozen core”
(Dirac)-Hartree-Fock equation.

In setting up the HF equations, we add λ r2 to the
nuclear potential and add 2λ ri· rj to the two-particle in-
teraction that deﬁnes the HF potential. The modiﬁed
electron-electron interaction becomes

PL(cos θ) + 2λ r1r2 P1(cos θ).

It follows that only the L = 1 term in the HF potential
is modiﬁed and this term becomes

+ 2λ r

Z

where Pa(r) and Qa(r) are large and small component
radial Dirac wave functions, respectively. As a practical
matter, we choose λ ≪ 1 for neutral atoms to main-
tain some resemblance to the usual HF picture. The HF
energy includes ﬁrst-order MBPT corrections, together
with all second- and higher-order RPA corrections.
In
columns 2 and 3 of Table I, we list HF valence energies
E(HF)
(λ) and the HF core energies E(HF)
(λ) as functions

of λ for the alkali-metal atoms from Li to Fr.

include those corrections to the matrix element of R2
usually associated with third-order MBPT – one interac-
tion with R2 and two Coulomb interactions. In columns

E(λn) by E[n]. The k-th approximation to the derivative
(dE/dλ)(k) has an error proportional to hk. The ﬁrst two
of these formulas are given in Abramowitz and Stegun
[11, Chap. 25].

In Table II, we show results of applying the diﬀeren-
tiation formulas to the data in Table I. The resulting
values of
are numerically stable to about 4 digits
for the cases considered. These values are compared with
values from third-order MBPT and other accurate values
in Table III.

state removal energies of Cs and Tl in [13]. In the present
applications, these formulas are used to evaluate, eﬀec-
tively, fourth-order corrections to matrix elements of R2.
Although we do not expect the third-order calculations
presented in this section to be as accurate as the singles-
doubles (SD) calculations given in the following section,
it is in any case necessary to carry out third-order energy
calculations to determine E(3)
extra, the correction to the SD
energies that accounts approximately for omitted triple
excitations in the SD equations.

E. All-Order Singles-Doubles

The singles-doubles (SD) equations, also referred to
as all-order pair equations [14, Chap. 15], provide a

4

method of including important correlation corrections to
the atomic wave function to all-orders in perturbation
theory. One solves a set of coupled equations for single
excitation coeﬃcients ρma, ρmv and double excitation co-
eﬃcients ρmnab, ρmnva of the HF ground state [see 15,
for example]. Once these expansion coeﬃcients have been
determined, the correlation correction to the core energy
∆Ec is given by

∆Ec =

vabmn ˜ρmnab.

The core energy is exact through third order in MBPT
and contains important fourth- and higher-order correc-
tions. The valence energy also includes important fourth-
and higher-order corrections but is missing small third-
order corrections [written out explicitly in 15] referred
to as E(3)
extra. These missing terms have their origin in
omitted triple excitations (single-valence – double-core
excitations) of the HF ground state. Numerical values of
E(3)
extra for the alkali-metal atoms are given at the end of
Section III D.

a. Lithium: Calculations for Li include all partial
waves with l ≤ 6. To estimate higher l contributions we
use Aitken’s δ2 method. Table IV shows contributions
to
evaluated with lmax ranging from 2 to 5. The
R2
ﬁnal extrapolated value
= 18.213 from Table IV
diﬀers from the “exact” nonrelativistic value (18.216004)
for lithium given by Yan and Drake [6], but is in precise
agreement with an earlier SD result by Derevianko et al.
[9]. The small diﬀerence with the exact nonrelativistic
value is dominated by the contribution from E(3)
extra, eval-
uated in the previous subsection, which has the value
dE(3)
extra/dλ = 0.0025. When this correction is added to
the SD result 18.2130 for lithium, we obtain the value
18.2155, diﬀering from the exact nonrelativistic result by
only -0.0005. The residual diﬀerence has the sign and
order of magnitude expected for a relativistic correction
to R2.

b. Other alkalis

In Table V, we show the derivatives
of valence and core energies of alkali atoms from Li to
Fr calculated in the SD approximation with lmax = 6
as the order of the diﬀerentiation is increased. We also
include the contribution from the missing third-order en-
ergy E(3)

extra evaluated in the previous section.

The SD result for sodium

= 22.6425(3) agrees
well with the earlier SD result 22.6293 from Derevianko
et al. [9] and with the semi-empirical value 22.65 from
Kharchenko et al. [5]. Note however, that present results
for all alkali atoms other than lithium are substantially

Conclusion

In this paper we present the most complete fully ab ini-
tio all-order calculations of the Lennard-Jones interaction
constant C3 for alkali-metal atoms. Incorporating of the
rescaled R2 operator into original Hartree-Fock Hamilto-
nian allows us to stay within standard SD technique while

also including important subclasses of higher-order con-
tributions. Results for Li agree precisely with the “exact”
CI results of Yan and Drake [6], while results for other
alkali atoms are probably the most accurate available to
date.

Cold inelastic collisions between conﬁned cesium (Cs) atoms and Cs2 molecules are investigated
inside a CO2 laser dipole trap. Inelastic atom-molecule collisions can be observed and measured
with a rate coeﬃcient of ∼ 2.5 × 10−11 cm3 s−1, mainly independent of the molecular ro-vibrational
state populated. Lifetimes of purely atomic and molecular samples are essentially limited by rest gas
collisions. The pure molecular trap lifetime ranges 0,3-1 s, four times smaller than the atomic one,
as is also observed in a pure magnetic trap. We give an estimation of the inelastic molecule-molecule
collision rate to be ∼ 10−11 cm3 s−1.

Cold molecular gases have established a novel ﬁeld of
research in the past few years. After demonstrations of
several methods to prepare cold samples of molecules,
spectacular advances have been achieved, one of them be-
ing the formation of molecular condensates from atomic
Fermi gases [1, 2].
Increasing inter-disciplinary eﬀorts
are motivated by a wide range of new phenomena and
applications [3]. E. g., cold polar molecules are candidate
systems for precision measurements [4] and for quantum
information schemes [5].

Understanding and controlling the collisional prop-
erties of mixed atomic and molecular gases is crucial
to achieve the regime of quantum degenerate molecular
gases. Up to now, very few experimental data are avail-
able, and systematic studies of stored atoms, molecules
or mixture of both, have just started [6, 7, 8]. As a re-
cent highlight, the formation of ultracold Cs4 molecules
by Feshbach collisions of Cs2 molecules has been ob-
served [9].

Although a large variety of techniques for the produc-
tion of cold molecular samples is currently being devel-
oped [3], sub-mK temperatures are only reached by pho-
toassociation (PA) out of an initially ultracold atomic
sample [10], and by molecule association through mag-
netic Feshbach resonances [11]. The two techniques are
complementary with respect to the nature of the formed
molecules: While Feshbach-association leads to loosely
bound molecules occupying the most weakly bound ro-
vibrational levels, PA allows to populate deeper bound
ro-vibrational states.

Cold molecular samples can be stored using magnetic
trapping as demonstrated with Cs2 [12] and KRb [13]
in their triplet state. Trapping molecules in any state
is possible in an optical trap as demonstrated by using
a CO2 laser (quasi-electrostatic trap, QUEST) with Cs2

molecules present in a MOT [14] or formed through a
Feshbach resonance [9] and with Rb2 molecules formed
via PA [15].

In this letter, we report the realization of a CO2 laser
based QUEST for mixed samples of Cs atoms and Cs2
molecules. The Cs2 molecules are formed in the elec-
tronic ground state or in the lowest triplet state via PA
of cold trapped atoms and are also eﬃciently trapped in-
side the QUEST. Lifetime measurements are performed
for both atomic and molecular samples. We character-
ize the inelastic collisions between cold atoms, between
cold atoms and cold molecules, and even between cold
molecules inside the QUEST. Quantitative data analysis
gives us access to the collision rate coeﬃcients.

The basic experimental setup has been previously de-
scribed (see e. g. [12]). The main change here is the im-
plementation of a CO2 laser to realize the QUEST. The
cold atoms are provided by a Cs vapor-loaded magneto-
optical trap (MOT) with a residual gas pressure in the
range of 10−7−10−8 Pa. The shape of the atomic cloud is
approximatively spherical, with a radius of 300 µm. The
number of atoms in the MOT is 107, leading to a peak
density of 2 × 1010 cm−3 by assuming a gaussian density
distribution. A cw CO2 laser (Synrad Firestar f100) is
focused into the MOT zone with a waist of ∼ 80 µm at
an available power of ∼ 110 W. The CO2 laser is ﬁrst
roughly aligned with the cold atomic cloud through two
ZnSe windows of the vacuum chamber by using a counter-
propagating beam, provided by a diode laser beam tuned
on the atomic transition 6s1/2, f = 4 −→ 6p3/2, f ′ = 5.
For more accurate alignment, we use the decrease of
MOT ﬂuorescence due to the light shift induced by the
CO2 laser.

The temporal sequence for the loading of the QUEST
from the MOT is the following. The CO2 laser is per-
manently on. First we cool the atoms with an opti-
cal molasses phase of 15 ms by switching oﬀ the mag-
netic ﬁeld gradient and by red-detuning the cooling laser
from 2.5 Γ to 27 Γ relatively to the atomic transition
6s1/2, f = 4 −→ 6p3/2, f ′ = 5 ; here Γ ≈ 2π × 5.2 MHz
corresponds to the decay rate of the 6p3/2 state. The
eﬃciency of the transfer of atoms from the MOT to the

FIG. 2: (Color online) PA spectrum of the 0−
g (6s + 6p3/2)
(v = 6, J) lines in the MOT (grey line) and in the optical
trap (dark line (orange online)). A ﬁt of the latter is also
represented (dotted line) (see text).

FIG. 1: (Color online) Temporal evolution of the atomic and
molecular population in the QUEST. The evolution of the
number of trapped atoms prepared in the hyperﬁne states f =
3 (open squares line) and f = 4 (ﬁlled squares line) is plotted.
The decay of atoms in f = 3 is ﬁtted by an exponentially
decreasing function (dot line) with a time constant τ = 2.7 s,
whereas, for atoms in f = 4, a ﬁt function accounting for two-
body collisions (ﬁlled stars) is necessary. The ﬁlled circles
curve shows the evolution of the number of molecules in a
mixed atomic and molecular trap. In the inset, we plot the
decay constant associated with the molecular trap for diﬀerent
numbers of atoms left in the QUEST. We also represent the
evolution of a pure molecular sample (open circles line), ﬁtted
by an exponential decay function (dotted line) with a time
constant τ = 640 ms.
In these experiments, molecules are
formed via PA of the state 0−
g (6s + 6p3/2) (v = 6, J = 2).

QUEST is typically around three percent. The detection
of the atoms is performed by a resonant three-photon
ionization process via the level 10s, using a pulsed dye
laser (λ = 706.7 nm) pumped by the second harmonic of
a Nd:YAG laser. To prepare the atoms in the hyperﬁne
level f = 3 (resp. f = 4), we switch oﬀ the repumping
beam 3 ms before (resp. after) the end of the molasses
phase.

Fig. 1 shows the temporal evolution of the number of
atoms in the QUEST, NCs(t). For the hyperﬁne ground
state level f = 3, we observe an exponential drop with a
lifetime of 2.7 ± 0.2 s, limited by the background vacuum
pressure. However for f = 4 hyperﬁne level, inelastic
two-body collisions lead to a clearly non-exponential de-
cay at short times. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of
the atoms and considering the binary collision parameter
GCs = 1.1×10−11 cm3s−1 [16], we were able to determine
an average density nCs(0) ≈ 3 × 1011 cm−3 after loading
the trap. The corresponding initial number of atoms is
NCs(0) ≈ 3.5 × 105.

The cold trapped atoms are photoassociated in a cho-
u,g , converging

sen rovibrationnal level (v, J), of state Ω+,−

We have considered diﬀerent states, 0−
g , 1u(6s + 6p3/2)
and 0+
u (6s + 6p1/2), leading, for u symmetry (resp. g
symetry), to the formation of cold molecules in the
ground state, X 1Σ+
in the lowest triplet state,
a3Σ+
u ) [17]. The PA laser is provided by a Ti:Sapphire
laser (Coherent 899 ring laser) pumped by an Argon-ion
laser. The laser beam is focused to a ≃ 300 µm spot with
an available intensity of 300 W cm−2. The maximum
number of formed molecules in the QUEST is obtained
by applying the PA laser during 30 ms. For longer times,
the number of molecules decreases due to the excitation
of the molecules by the PA laser. In order to detect the
translationaly cold Cs2 molecules, we photoionize them
into Cs+
2 ions (REMPI process), and selectively detected
them with a pair of microchannel plates through a time-
of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. Molecular photoionization
is provided by the same pulsed dye laser as the one used
for atomic detection, but using a slightly diﬀerent wave-
length, around 712 nm. We detect an initial number of
molecules NCs2 (0) ≈ 4000, corresponding to an average
molecular density nCs2 (0) ≈ 1010 cm−3.

Fig. 2 shows typical PA spectra obtained in a MOT and
in a QUEST, corresponding to the 0−
g (6s + 6p3/2)(v =
6, J) excitation. For the MOT spectrum the rotational
levels J = 0 to 3 are shown, and for the QUEST only
J = 2 level was recorded in this ﬁgure. We observe
a 42 MHz shift of the resonance between the two spec-
tra because of the dynamical Stark eﬀect due to the
CO2 laser. The expected value of this shift is given by
∆ν = (cid:0)α6s − α6p3/2 (cid:1) P/(πhε0cw2
0), where α6s and α6p3/2
are the electrostatic polarizabilities of atoms in 6s and
6p3/2 states [18], P is the power of the laser beam and
w0 its waist. Considering an available power of 110 W, we
ﬁnd w0 = 84±4 µm, leading to an atomic potential depth
of 0.9 mK and a molecular one of 1.5 mK, calculated with
the Cs2 static polarizability given in [19]. Considering
similar atomic QUEST experiments [16], we assume an
atomic trap temperature T ≈ 40+10
−10 µK. We will also
consider the molecular temperature to be roughly iden-

tical to the atomic one since the PA process does not
induce any additional heating [10].
We want to mention here that the analysis of the PA line
shape (see ﬁt in Fig. 2) allows us to observe the magnetic
sub levels structure of the J = 2 state whose degeneracy
is lifted by the CO2 laser electric ﬁeld [20, 21]. This leads
to a PA line broadening of ≈ 5 MHz in addition to the
natural linewidth of ≈ 10 MHz. The full analysis of the
PA lineshape is here in agreement with a temperature of
≈ 40 µK.

Fig. 1 shows the temporal evolution of the number of
atoms and molecules in the trap. The lower curve of this
ﬁgure (ﬁlled circles) shows a lifetime of 110 ms for the
molecular cloud in presence of cold atoms, which is quite
short compared to the 2.7 s lifetime of the atomic cloud.
This molecular trap lifetime does not depend on whether
the atoms left in the trap are in f = 3 or f = 4 hyperﬁne
state. Similar lifetime measurements are obtained after
PA of atoms in any of those two hyperﬁne states. We
interpret this lifetime as the result of inelastic collisions
between cold atoms and cold molecules. By pushing the
atoms outside the QUEST, using a resonant laser beam
on the transition 6s1/2, f = 4 −→ 6p3/2, f ′ = 5 (the re-
pumping beam is on again during this phase), we observe
an increase of this lifetime up to 640 ms. The inset of
Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the molecular sample life-
time versus the number of atoms left in the QUEST. We
can see that this lifetime is quite sensitive even to a small
number of atoms in the trap. The dynamics of the molec-
ular population for the mixed trap is given by the rate
equation

is the background loss rate, KCs2Cs and
where ΓCs2
GCs2 are the atom-molecule and molecule-molecule col-
lision rate coeﬃcient, respectively. Neglecting at early
times GCs2 , we extract from our data the parameter
KCs2Cs = 2.5+2
−0.5 × 10−11 cm3 s−1. This large incertainty
on the value of KCs2Cs comes mostly from the incertainty
on the atomic temperature.

As already mentioned, PA in the potentials 0−

g , 1u(6s+
6p3/2) and 0+
u (6s + 6p1/2) was also performed, as shown
in Fig. 3a. We have also considered a particular scheme
for the formation of molecules (see Fig. 3b), where atoms
are photoassociated into one level (v = 103) of the outer
well of the 0−
g (6s+ 6p3/2) potential, coupled by tunneling
eﬀect with those of the inner one and predicted to form
deeper bound molecules in the triplet ground state [22].
Cold atom-molecule collision rate and molecule collision
rate with background gas does not seem to depend on
the photoassociated state.

All observed lifetimes of a pure molecular trap are
about four times smaller than those observed for the

atomic cloud (f = 3) in the same conditions of vac-
uum background. To explain this diﬀerence, we have
ﬁrst tested the role of the CO2 laser intensity on both
trap lifetimes. We have considered two diﬀerent waists
(84 and 100 µm) for the QUEST leading to two diﬀer-
ent laser intensities. We have not observed any diﬀer-
ence for the atomic and molecular trap lifetime for both
waists. It does not seem that the CO2 laser induces sig-
niﬁcant transitions between ro-vibrational levels which
are electric-dipole allowed due to the contribution of the
second-order spin-orbit interaction [23].
It seems that
the explanation for this factor 4 comes from the fact that
the cross-section for collisions between hot atom and cold
molecules is larger by the same factor compared to the
hot atom-cold atom cross-section. This result is not so
surprising if we consider that the formed and detected
molecules are in a bunch of ro-vibrationnal levels close in
energy to the dissociation limit 6s + 6s. These molecules
have large maximum elongations leading to large impact
parameters. To conﬁrm this assertion, we have measured
the atomic and molecular trap lifetimes in the case of a
pure magnetic conﬁnement with a setup similar to the
one of [23]. Here the atomic and molecular densities are
two orders of magnitude lower, and the inelastic colli-
sions between cold species can be ignored. We have seen
that both lifetimes are limited by the background gas
collisions and are mostly identical to those observed in
the QUEST, with the same factor 4 between atomic and

molecular case.

The role of molecule-molecule collisions is not dom-
inant in our experiment compared to the one of back-
ground gas collisions. Fig. 4 gives the evolution of a
pure molecular sample with optimized initial number of
molecules and background gas pressure. A simple expo-
nential decay function does not ﬁt very well the data.
Nevertheless, with a two-body ﬁt function, the data are
better ajusted and we estimate GCs2 = 1.0(5)×10−11 cm3
s−1, in agreement with results given in reference [9].

To conclude, we have reported the realization and
the characterization of an atomic and molecular QUEST
which constitutes a quite exciting tool to trap homonu-
clear molecules. Depending on the initial experimen-
tal conditions, we obtained cold molecule clouds with a
number of molecules up to 12000 (nCs2 (0) ≈ 3 × 1010
cm−3) and trap lifetimes up to 1 s. A systematic colli-
sional study inside the QUEST allowed us to determine
the atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collision rates.
Both rates are close to the unitarity limit (≈ 1.5 × 10−11
cm3 s−1 for atom-molecule collisions and ≈ 8×10−12 cm3
s−1 for molecule-molecule collisions) and are not compat-
ible with the formation of a stable Bose-Einstein conden-
sate of molecules formed initially from bosonic atoms.
The theoretical reference [24] predicts an atom-molecule
collisional rate quite sensitive to the vibrational level of

seen any evidence of such dependence, but further ex-
periments with selected ro-vibrationnal levels are nec-
essary to deﬁnitely conclude. Concerning the lifetime
of a pure molecular trap, molecule collisions with back-
ground gas is the limiting process; the collision cross-
section beeing about a factor 4 higher than the one for
the atoms. To go further, it can be interesting to increase

4

the trap lifetime by decreasing the vacuum background
pressure, which should permit us to measure the life-
time of the metastable molecular triplet state a3Σ+
u , to
study more precisely molecule-molecule collisions and to
observe molecular transitions induced by the CO2 laser.
Up to now, the molecules are preferentially formed in
high vibrational levels. An interesting challenge is to pre-
pare the molecules in low vibrational levels of the singlet
state which may exhibit diﬀerent behavior against colli-
sional processes. Two-photon PA [25, 26] toward highly
excited states can oﬀer good conﬁguration. Another
challenge is to prepare the molecules in a well deﬁned
ro-vibrationnal level using Raman PA [25, 26], chirped
pulse PA [27] or microwave PA. At term a dense and
cold molecular sample could be prepared in the lowest
rovibrational level (v = 0, J = 0) of the ground state
where Bose-Einstein condensation of such a gas would
not be impeded by inelastic collisions.

spectroscopy measurements. Cold atoms are captured in a dark region of space
inside a blue-detuned hollow laser beam formed by an axicon. We analyze the light

A single hollow beam optical trap for cold atoms

1. Introduction

Precision spectroscopy and experiments to test discrete fundamental symmetries in
atomic systems, such as Parity or Time, beneﬁt from long coherence times and
perturbation-free environments. Blue-detuned optical dipole traps, in which atoms are
conﬁned to minima of the light ﬁeld, may meet both of these requirements: Trapping
insures long interrogation times of the atoms, while the low light level, or sometimes
the absence of light in the trapping region reduces perturbations from the trap itself.

There are several realizations of such blue-detuned optical traps in the literature,
and the geometrical and optical arrangements vary considerably. The ﬁrst traps of
this kind used multiple laser beams to provide a closed trapping volume for the atoms.
Sodium atoms were captured in between sheets of laser light [1], cesium atoms were
stored in a trap that uses gravity and a combination of an evanescent wave and a hollow
beam [2], and rubidium atoms were trapped inside a doughnut beam closed by additional
laser beams along the direction of propagation [3]. More recently, three far oﬀ resonant
traps for cold atoms that use a single laser beam were demonstrated experimentally. In
one case the dark trapping region was achieved by use of a phase plate that introduces
a phase diﬀerence of π between the central and outer part of the laser beam [4]. In
the other two experiments a rotating focused Gaussian beam produced the conﬁning
potential that enclosed a light-free volume [5, 6].

We present in this article a new single beam optical dipole trap [7], which we
have developed for possible use in a measurement of parity non-conservation (PNC)
in francium [8]. The cold atoms are trapped inside a hollow beam which is obtained
by placing an axicon or conical lens into the path of the laser light that forms the
“axicon trap”. Because in PNC experiments the signals are generally rather small, we
are interested in a large trapping volume. In the case of the axicon trap the dark volume
can be as large as 80 mm3 and we have trapped up to one million atoms in it.

This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the formation of the region
of darkness using ray optics (section II). Predictions are compared to measurements of
the intensity at diﬀerent positions along the optical axis. In section III we present the
experimental implementation of the axicon trap using a sample of precooled metastable
xenon atoms. Finally, we comment on conditions and usage of the axicon trap for PNC
experiments in francium.

2. Ray optics of the axicon trap

In a far-oﬀ-resonance blue-detuned optical dipole trap the atoms experience a conﬁning
potential and may spend most of their time in the dark, provided the trap is designed
appropriately. The simplest implementation of such a trap uses a single hollow laser
beam. The atoms are captured in a region of darkness that is completely surrounded by
light. We realize this conﬁning “black-box” by means of an axicon. The use of axicons
in atom manipulation is well established [2, 9, 10], as they are a way to produce hollow

beams of light.

Axicon

Axicons, originally proposed by McLeod [11], have also been studied for imaging
systems, and to produce Bessel beams [12, 13, 14, 15]. In contrast to an ordinary lens
which has a spherical surface, the axicon has a conical surface. For an apex angle of
π − 2α and an index of refraction n, all incident rays are deviated by the same angle
ξ = α(n − 1). Fig. 1 illustrates the path of a diverging light beam through an axicon
lens. The incident beam is split into two beams of opposite inclinations.

z1 before and z2 behind the axicon. We denote r the radius of the light beam that
enters the setup at lens L1. When a parallel light beam enters the setup a region of

darkness forms beyond the second lens. A simple ray optics diagram (Fig. 3) illustrates
the formation of this region in which no rays cross. The conical lens focuses incident
diverging light into a circle, rather than a spot as would be the case for a spherical lens.

The distance D from the second lens at which the circle of foci forms, in the paraxial
and thin lens approximation is given by:

D = f2

z1 + z2 − f1
z1 + z2 − (f1 + f2)

.

The position of the focal plane of the setup, at D, is independent of the presence of the
axicon.

Ray tracing allows us to determine which rays cross in order to form the cusps that
appear at the closer (z = znear) and distant (z = zfar) boundaries of the dark region.
Rays originating from the outer edge of the incident parallel beam cross at znear, whereas
incident rays very close to the optical axis (when r → 0) form the cusp at zfar. With
this in mind, we ﬁnd the positions of the cusps (measured from the lens L2, provided
that z1 > f1, z2 > f2):

znear =

r(cid:16)1 − z1

.

In order to calculate the total volume of the dark region we need to determine the
radius of the circle of foci. Again, using only geometric optics we ﬁnd that the largest
transverse size of the dark region (at z = D ) is given by:

rlargest =

ξf2(z1 − f1)
z1 + z2 − (f1 + f2)

.

This equation shows that the size of the circle of foci depends directly on the deﬂection
angle ξ and thus the angle α of the axicon.

The ray optics calculations can predict the shape and the location of the dark region
in space, but cannot give any information about the size of the beam at the focal plane,
or more precisely, the width of the ring of foci wring. We can, however, determine the
divergence angle of the beam at the circle of foci. It equals half the divergence angle of
the beam that would be focused at z = D in absence of the axicon lens. In the large
distance limit of Gaussian optics the waist at the focus is inversely proportional to the
divergence angle. Therefore wring = 2wspot, where wspot designates the waist of the beam
formed without the axicon. This result agrees with calculations of Refs. [13, 14, 15].

We measured the intensity proﬁle of the laser beam shaped by the optical setup
of Fig. 2 by using a charged coupled device (CCD) camera with 16 bit resolution. The
parameters used in the experiment are: f1 = 50.8 mm, f2 = 405 mm, z1 = 163 mm,
z2 = 799 mm. In an independent measurement we determined α = 18.2 ± 0.4 mrad,
which leads to ξ = 8.2 ± 0.2 mrad. The trap region is an elongated diamond of
revolution with a diameter of roughly 1.5 mm and 150 mm of length. The measured
intensity distributions in the radial direction, at the location of the circle of foci
(z = D), and along the optical axis are shown in ﬁgures 4 and 5, respectively.
The recorded intensities are normalized to I0, the intensity at lens L1. The location

mm are indicated. Because in the vicinity of these points the intensity does not
increase sharply, it is diﬃcult to clearly identify znear and zfar in the measured intensity
distribution. Diﬀraction smoothes the onset of the intensity maxima and imperfections
of the axicon lens can further deteriorate the dark region. Because the axicon is not
a perfect cone, and in particular when it has a slightly ﬂattened apex, light may pass
directly on axis. By approximating the trapping volume with two cones that share a
base we infer a volume of ∼ 80 mm3 in which atoms may be captured.

The optical potential U(r) seen by the trapped atoms is directly proportional to the
light intensity I(r) [17], for large detuning from the optical transition. Figure 6 shows
a three dimensional rendition of the axial and radial intensities in the neighborhood of
the dark region. We calculate the intensities by ﬁnding the number of rays that cross
in any given area. The potential of the axicon trap is similar to the potential produced
when using a phase plate [4, 16] or a hologram [18]. In all setups, the height of the
potential well forming the trap is non-uniform. The depth of the trap is determined
by the location with the smallest potential barrier which occurs slightly oﬀ axis in all

have an intensity of 0.20 I0, where I0 is the intensity at lens L1. These points form
a ring of escape avenues for atoms from the trap. The point of highest intensity is
located at znear, where almost all intensity is concentrated and not at z = D, where the
intensity is distributed in a ring of diameter 2rlargest and width wring. These features
render the axicon trap very attractive when combined with gravity, i.e. when the laser
beam propagates upwards. However, in this work for technical reasons related to the

geometry of the vacuum chamber, the trap is formed using a light beam that propagates
horizontally.

3. Experimental implementation

In the laboratory we realized the axicon trap using laser-cooled metastable xenon atoms.
The choice of the atom was arbitrary, simply that xenon was available for this work.
In xenon the optical dipole transition at 882 nm from the metastable 6s[3/2]2 state to
the 6p[5/2]3 state is used for laser cooling. The lifetime of the lower state is 43 s, and is
much longer than the typical time scale of about 2 s for each individual experiment. The
apparatus, as well as the slowing and trapping sequence have been described in detail in
Ref. [19]. The infrared laser light for all cooling and trapping is provided by Ti:sapphire
lasers. Brieﬂy, we collect a few million atoms in the magneto-optical trap which has an
rms radius of σ ≃ 200 µm. Cooling by optical molasses further reduces the temperature
of the atoms to about 10 µK. We record the number of atoms and their arrival times
onto a microchannel plate detector located about 15 cm below the interaction region.
In all experiments the time origin is established by extinction of the light forming the

A single hollow beam optical trap for cold atoms

optical molasses. The atoms reach the detector after about 175 ms of free ﬂight. The
spread in arrival times reﬂects the spread in velocities of the atoms and can be related
to their temperature.

We load cold atoms from the magneto-optical trap into the co-located axicon trap
to test it. Light for this trap comes from a second Ti:sapphire laser and is detuned above
resonance by about ≃ 2 × 103 Γ from the cooling transition, where Γ/2π = 5.2 MHz is
the natural linewidth of the upper level. The optical power in the beam is typically
between 25 − 75 mW and the size of the beam at lens L1 is approximately 8 mm in
diameter. In the time sequence of the experiment we switch oﬀ the near resonant laser
light of the optical molasses and simultaneously turn on the far detuned light of the
axicon trap. The results for diﬀerent durations during which the axicon beam is turned
on are shown in Fig. 7. The ﬁrst time of ﬂight signal shown is a reference signal (a):
all atoms are released from the optical molasses without being loaded into the axicon
trap. All other signals correspond to situations in which the axicon trap was kept on
for variable trapping durations τ . A second peak, displaced in arrival time by τ from
the reference peak, appears in the signal and represents atoms held in the axicon trap.
Atoms that were lost in the transfer form a peak centered around 175 ms, the ballistic
time of ﬂight.

To ensure an eﬃcient loading of the axicon trap, care is taken to spatially overlap
the dark region in the laser beam forming the axicon trap with the magneto-optical
trap. We achieved transfers of up to ≈ 50% of the atoms from the magneto-optical

captured by the axicon trap. When τ ≤ 10 ms the two peaks in the time of ﬂight signal
partly overlap, whereas at larger values of τ loss of atoms from the axicon trap starts
to become important.

We vary the duration of time τ during which atoms are held in the axicon trap to
determine the lifetime of the trap. The result of a series of such measurements is shown
in Fig. 8. After about 30 ms half of the initially trapped atoms are still in the trap. This
characteristic time strongly depends on the detuning δ and the total intensity I of the
laser forming the trap. In order to study how the lifetime of the trap is aﬀected by the
detuning we performed a measurement in which we vary the spontaneous scattering rate
(∝ I/δ2), but keep the height of the potential barrier experienced by the atoms(∝ I/δ)
constant. The lifetime of the trap increases with the detuning, consistent with heating
due to spontaneous emission.

We have estimated the number of spontaneous emission events as an atom with an
energy corresponding to 10 µK climbs the potential barrier in various locations inside
the trap. The recoil energy for a Xe* atom per scatter is 0.186 µK. For atoms at
10µK, the eﬀect of gravity on the energy of the atoms cannot be neglected. The ramp
which gravity superimposes onto the light potential has a slope of 3.2 mK/cm. An atom
released on axis at z=D falls 0.74 mm hitting the focal ring in 12.3 ms with a maximum
horizontal excursion of 0.3 mm while gaining 230 µK in kinetic energy. During the fall
the atom remains primarily in the dark region of the trap and scatters about 160 photons

per second (70 mW power, 11.7 GHz detuning). The atom, which now has a kinetic
energy of somewhat below 240 µK, is repelled by a potential wall of nearly 325 µK.
Atoms released within an interval of 12 mm, roughly centered at z = D are repelled
by a potential wall of at least 240 µK. Outside this range, the atoms can gain enough
kinetic energy as they fall down to jump the potential wall. This conﬁning region is
24% of the total trapping volume. This emphasizes the importance of a careful overlap
between the region in space where the magneto-optical trap is formed and the location
of the bright ring of the axicon trap.

At this point we can say that our results are consistent with losses due to gravity
and the eﬀect of heating due to spontaneous scattering [17] and we can not exclude losses
due to light assisted collisions [20]. The eﬀective volume of the trapping region may be
increased by overlapping the conﬁning regions of two such axicon traps (orthogonal
optical axes) or by directing the optical axis of a single trap vertically.

4. Conclusions

We have demonstrated a new optical arrangement to generate regions of darkness that
we have used to trap laser cooled xenon atoms. We created this dark volume by placing
an axicon lens in the path of a single laser beam tuned below the atomic resonance.
Geometric optics allows quantitative understanding of the shape and size of the trapping
potential. The dark volume can be as large as 80 mm3 and we have trapped up to one

million atoms in it.

Due to its simplicity the axicon trap may be an attractive tool for precision
experiments. We would like to use this blue-detuned optical trap for francium atoms
on which we perform parity nonconservation (PNC) measurements. We can extract
the PNC information from precision measurements of electromagnetically forbidden
transitions that are investigated in an environment of well deﬁned handedness. A far
detuned blue optical dipole trap has the advantage that the externally applied DC
electric and magnetic ﬁelds, as well as the ~k of the laser excitation ﬁeld are decoupled
from the light ﬁeld that provides the trap. We have demonstrated trapping of 1000 210Fr
atoms in a magneto-optical trap [22], a number that we have increased by a factor of
ten [23]. We are currently working on improving the number of trapped atoms by using
a double MOT system and thus having a much longer trap life-time. Radioactive 210Fr
has a lifetime of approximately 3 min which, when contained in a trap, is long enough
to perform the sequence of measurements necessary for determining the parity violation
signal [21]. With respect to other precision spectroscopy to test discrete symmetries,
Romalis and Fortson [24] have shown that to perform a more sensitive test of time
invariance with trapped atoms in a dipole trap than presently done, it is necessary to
have about 108 trapped atoms interrogated for about 10 s.

Francium is the heaviest alkali atom, and thus the ﬁne structure of the D line is
signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by relativistic eﬀects. The ﬁne splitting between the D1 (817 nm)
and the D2 (718 nm) lines of Fr is 100 nm. For all PNC measurements the atoms have to
be prepared in one magnetic substate and this is generally done with optical pumping.
In the sequence of PNC determination, the m-state will be ﬂipped from mF = 13/2 to
mF = −13/2. Therefore it is important that the light shifts in the dipole trap be the
same for all Zeeman sublevels. In order to minimize the sensitivity to polarization eﬀects
due to the trapping light, the detuning has to be larger than the ﬁne structure splitting
of the D line [25]. This requires 32 W of laser power at 532 nm in order to produce an
axicon trap a ﬁfth of the size of the one discussed in this work, i.e. a trap with a ring
diameter of 300 µm and ring width of 30 µm. In such a trap francium atoms cooled to
the Doppler limit (≈ 180 µK) can be trapped in the dark. In the above considerations
linearly polarized light was employed. When using circularly polarized light, the laser
can be tuned between the D1 and D2 line and the required intensity is much lower.
However, in such a trap, which was demonstrated experimentally for rubidium atoms
[26], atoms are trapped in the region of highest intensity, and therefore it is not an
appropriate trap for precision measurements.

We are currently also investigating a new conﬁguration of far detuned trap, formed
by two counter-propagating “axicon beams” which permit a much tighter and more
symmetric trapping potential. However, the simplicity of the single beam axicon trap
may remain preferable.

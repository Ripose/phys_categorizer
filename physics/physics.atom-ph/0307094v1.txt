We demonstrate a technique for frequency measurements of atomic transitions

with a precision of 30 kHz. The frequency is measured using a ring-cavity

resonator whose length is calibrated against a reference laser locked to the D2

line of 87Rb, the frequency of which is known to 10 kHz. We have used this to

measure the hyperﬁne structure in the 5P3/2 state of 85Rb. We obtain precise

values for the hyperﬁne constants A = 25.041(6) MHz and B = 26.013(25)

MHz, and a value of 77.992(20) MHz for the isotope shift in the D2 line.

Precise measurements of atomic energy levels continue to play an important role

in the development of physics. The energy levels of alkali atoms are particularly

important because of their widespread use in laser-cooling experiments, ultra-cold

collision studies, photoassociation spectroscopy, atomic tests of parity violation, and

more recently in Bose-Einstein condensation. For example, precise measurement of

1

the D1 line in Cs1 combined with an atom-interferometric measurement of the photon

recoil shift2 could lead to a more precise determination of the ﬁne-structure constant

α. In addition, hyperﬁne-structure and isotope-shift measurements in atomic lines

can yield valuable information about the atomic wavefunction and the contribution

from nuclear interactions. This is important when comparing theoretical calculations

with experimental data in atomic tests of parity violation.3

In this Letter, we demonstrate a new technique for precisely measuring the fre-

quencies of atomic transitions. The technique combines the advantages of using tun-

able diode lasers to access atomic transitions with the fact that the absolute frequency

of the D2 line in 87Rb has been measured with an accuracy of 10 kHz.4 A stabilized

diode laser locked to this line is used as a frequency reference along with a ring-cavity

resonator whose length is locked to the reference laser. For a given cavity length,

an unknown laser locked to an atomic transition has a small frequency oﬀset from

the nearest cavity resonance. This oﬀset is combined with the cavity mode number

to obtain a precise value for the frequency of the unknown laser. We have used this

method to make precise measurements of various hyperﬁne transitions in the D2 line

of 85Rb. This yields the hyperﬁne structure in the 5P3/2 state of 85Rb and the isotope

shift in the D2 line. We demonstrate a precision of 30 kHz, which is more than an

order of magnitude improvement over the typical accuracy of other techniques such

as level-crossing or optical double-resonance.5 The only other technique with similar

precision is the frequency-comb method using mode-locked lasers.1 We believe our

technique is uniquely suited for measuring hyperﬁne intervals and isotope shifts since

the leading source of systematic errors cancels in such measurements.

2

Similar measurements have been done previously using a stabilized HeNe laser

as the frequency reference and a linear Fabry-Perot resonator.6 Our use of a Rb-

stabilized diode laser as the reference has the primary advantage that there are several

known hyperﬁne transitions that can be used for locking the laser. This enables us to

check systematic errors using diﬀerent reference frequencies. The use of a ring-cavity

resonator also has advantages over a linear resonator because the linear design can

cause feedback into the diode laser and destabilize it. By contrast, the ring cavity

has a traveling wave inside and there is no possibility of feedback destabilization.

Furthermore, the mode structure inside the cavity is elliptical, which makes it easier

to mode match the elliptical output of the diode laser.

The schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. The experiment uses two

frequency-stabilized diode lasers that are locked to atomic transitions using Doppler-

free saturated-absorption spectroscopy. Laser 1 is the reference laser locked on the D2

line of 87Rb. Laser 2 is the unknown laser, which in our case is locked on the D2 line

of 85Rb. The output of the two lasers is fed into the ring-cavity resonator. The cavity

length is adjusted using a piezo-mounted mirror to bring it into resonance with the

wavelength of Laser 1. The cavity is then locked to this length in a feedback loop.

However, Laser 2 will generally be oﬀset from the cavity resonance. This oﬀset is

accounted for by shifting the frequency of the laser using an acousto-optic modulator

(AOM) before it enters the cavity. The error signal between the shifted frequency

of Laser 2 and the cavity resonance is fed back to the AOM driver which locks the

frequency of the AOM at the correct oﬀset. The frequency is read using a frequency

counter. The absolute frequency of Laser 1 is known with 10 kHz accuracy,4 there-

3

fore, once the cavity length (or mode number) is known, the frequency of Laser 2 is

determined very precisely.

The diode lasers are standard external-cavity lasers stabilized using optical feed-

back from a piezo-mounted grating.7 They are locked by modulating the injection

current and using third-harmonic detection. The ring cavity consists of two plane

mirrors and two concave mirrors (f = 12.5 cm) in a bow-tie arrangement. The mir-

rors are mounted on a copper plate that is temperature controlled to ±0.01◦C using a

thermoelectric cooler. The cavity Q is 35 and the free-spectral range (fsr) is 1.3 GHz

(corresponding to a cavity length of 226.5 mm). Thus the cavity modes (shown in

Fig. 2) have a linewidth of about 37 MHz, which is similar to the linewidth of atomic

transitions used in laser stabilization. The low Q ensures robust locking that is quite

insensitive to perturbations over a wide dynamic range.

The most important aspect of the measurement is to ﬁx the mode number of the

cavity uniquely. This is done in two steps: we ﬁrst measure the cavity fsr and then

we use a known frequency for Laser 2. The fsr measurement proceeds as follows. We

lock the cavity with the reference laser on the F = 2 → F ′ = (2, 3) transition, as

shown in Fig. 2a, and measure the AOM oﬀset for a given transition of the unknown

laser. We then shift the reference laser to the F = 1 → F ′ = (1, 2) transition, which is

exactly 6622.887 MHz higher.5, 4 This shift causes the cavity mode number to increase

by almost exactly 5, as shown in Fig. 2b. The cavity is locked to the new frequency

and the AOM oﬀset for the same transition of the unknown laser is measured. The

diﬀerence in the two AOM oﬀsets along with the change in the reference frequency

gives exactly 5 times the cavity fsr. Using this method, the fsr is determined with a

4

precision of 20 kHz. To determine the mode number, we use a diode laser stabilized on

the Rb D1 line as Laser 2 and determine its AOM oﬀset. The frequency of this laser

is already known to an accuracy of 0.4 MHz.6 Thus, there is a unique mode number

that matches the resonance condition and the measured fsr. For example, the next

nearest mode satisfying the resonance has an fsr diﬀering by 350 kHz, or 17 times the

error in the determination of the fsr. Similarly, if the mode number is changed by 1,

the inferred frequency of Laser 2 changes by 30 MHz, which is 75 times larger than

the error with which the frequency is known.

We have used the technique to measure hyperﬁne structure in Rb. To test the

reliability of the measurement and our error budget, we ﬁrst measured hyperﬁne tran-

sitions in the D2 line of 87Rb where the frequencies are already known to an accuracy

of 10 kHz. For example, for the F = 2 → F ′ = (1, 3) transition, we measure a fre-

quency of 384 227 903.438(30) MHz while the value from Ref. 4 is 384 227 903.407(10)

MHz. With these checks, we have measured hyperﬁne transitions in 85Rb. The results

are listed in Table 1. Each value is an average over 50 individual measurements. The 5

measurements listed are not all independent because there are only 4 hyperﬁne levels

in the 5P3/2 state. Measurements 2 and 4 couple to the same excited level from diﬀer-

ent ground levels, therefore their diﬀerence should be the ground hyperﬁne splitting

of 3035.732 MHz.5 The measured diﬀerence of 3035.682(45) MHz is a further check on

our error budget. We have also repeated these measurements with the reference laser

on the F = 1 → F ′ = (1, 2) transition, and veriﬁed that the results are consistent

within the quoted errors. Finally, the measurements were repeated over a period of

several weeks to check for any long-term variation.

5

The several internal consistency checks discussed above check one class of system-

atic errors, namely those that are wavelength independent. They could arise because

of shifts in the lock point of the lasers, peak pulling from residual Doppler proﬁle,

optical pumping eﬀects, etc. In addition, we have veriﬁed that systematic errors due

to stray magnetic ﬁelds or collisional shifts in the Rb vapor cell are negligible. The

magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the cell is less than 0.1 mT, and we have repeated

the measurement with the vapor cell at diﬀerent locations to check that the shift is

negligible. Collisional shifts in the vapor cells are estimated to be less than 10 kHz,

and we have used diﬀerent vapor cells to verify that these shifts are also negligible.

There is another class of systematic errors that is wavelength dependent. Since

our cavity is comparing the wavelengths of the two lasers, we have to convert these

to frequencies using the refractive index of air.8, 9 Any error in the refractive index

would reﬂect as a systematic shift in the measured frequency. The ratio of refractive

indices at two wavelengths from Ref. 8 is expected to be correct only at the 10−9

level, therefore, in future, we plan to use an evacuated cavity to eliminate dispersion

eﬀects. Such errors can also arise from wavelength-dependent phase shifts in the cavity

mirrors. The dielectric coatings have extremely ﬂat response over ∼200 nm and we

do not expect this to aﬀect measurements at the 30 kHz level over a range of 100 nm.

It is important to note that this class of wavelength-dependent systematic errors

does not aﬀect the determination of frequency diﬀerences of the unknown laser, up to

several 10s of GHz. This is the order of magnitude of frequency diﬀerences that arise

when determining hyperﬁne structure or isotope shifts. Thus, in the present case, we

are conﬁdent that such systematic errors are negligible in the determination of the

6

hyperﬁne intervals in 85Rb. Indeed, the absolute frequencies of the various transitions

in Table 1 are also correct because both lasers are at the same wavelength of 780 nm

and there is no need to correct for the dispersion of air.

We have used the data in Table 1 to obtain the hyperﬁne coupling constants

in the 5P3/2 state of 85Rb. The measured intervals are ﬁtted to the magnetic-dipole

coupling constant A and the electric-quadrupole coupling constant B, to yield values

of A = 25.041(6) MHz and B = 26.013(25) MHz. In Fig. 3a, we show the good

agreement between the measured intervals and the intervals calculated from the ﬁtted

constants. The A and B values are compared to the earlier values of Arimondo et al.5

and Barwood et al.6 in Fig. 3b. Our value of A is consistent with the previous values

but has much smaller error. However, the three values of B are quite discrepant and

have non-overlapping error bars, though our value overlaps with the recommended

value of Arimondo et al. at the 2σ level. Finally, the calculated hyperﬁne shifts can

be used to obtain the hyperﬁne-free D2 frequency, which in turn yields the isotope

shift in this line to be 77.992(20) MHz.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique for precisely measuring the

frequency of atomic transitions. We have used this technique to measure hyperﬁne

transitions in the D2 line of 85Rb with a precision of 30 kHz. Since the reference and

unknown lasers are diode lasers locked to atomic transitions using similar techniques,

the accuracy and stability of our measurements are both determined by how well

we can lock the lasers to the line-center. In future, we plan to use an evacuated

cavity where the leading source of systematic error due to dispersion of air will be

overcome. This will enable us to measure transitions in other alkali atoms (such as Li,

7

K, and Cs) where the transitions are similarly accessible using diode lasers, but the

diﬀerence from the reference frequency is much larger. Another improvement is to mix

both beams in an optical ﬁber for better mode-matching into the cavity. We believe

the technique can also be extended to UV atomic lines by using a frequency-doubled

IR laser. By measuring the IR frequency instead of the UV frequency, we can get

similar accuracy for UV lines without the concomitant sources of systematic error.

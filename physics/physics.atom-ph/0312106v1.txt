Accurate QED calculations of the interelectron interaction corrections for the (1s2p)2 1P1,
(1s2p)2 3P1 two-electron conﬁgurations for ions with nuclear charge numbers 10 ≤ Z ≤ 92 are
performed within the line proﬁle approach. Total energies of these conﬁgurations are evaluated.
Employing the fully relativistic treatment based on the j–j coupling scheme these energy levels
become quasi-degenerate in the region Z ≤ 40. To treat such states within the framework of QED
we utilize the line proﬁle approach. The calculations are performed within the Coulomb gauge.

I. INTRODUCTION

To provide accurate quantum-electrodynamical (QED) evaluations of energy levels for two- and three-electron
conﬁgurations of highly charged ions (HCI) become now an urgent problem in atomic physics. This can be explained
by the growing number of experimental data and the necessity to use the energy levels for the evaluation of important
characteristics of HCI, such as e.g. transition probabilities and recombination cross sections.

In the past an approximate relativistic approach based on variational non-relativistic wave functions has been used
for evaluating energy levels [1]. Numerous theoretical results for few-electron ions have been obtained within the
framework of fully relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) and relativistic all-order many-body theory
(AO) [2]. However, rigorous QED results, which allow for a consequent order-by-order improvement of the accuracy
of the calculations become more and more desirable.

The approximation of non-interacting electrons is commonly employed as a zeroth-order approximation in QED
perturbation theory for HCI in the absence of a quasi-degeneracy of levels. Accordingly, within the zeroth-order the
energy of the few-electron conﬁguration appears as the sum of the Dirac eigenvalues for the occupied one-electron
states. One-electron corrections (termed here as generalized Lamb shift) include QED radiative corrections, such as
the electron self energy (SE) and vacuum polarization (VP) as well as nuclear corrections, i.e., nuclear size (NS),
nuclear recoil (NR) and nuclear polarization (NP), respectively. Few years ago a status report of one-electron energy
corrections has been presented in detail in [3]. Since then considerable progress concerning the evaluation of higher-
order self-energy corrections has been made [4].

The dominant two-electron contribution is due to the interelectron interaction. Ab initio QED results for the
ﬁrst-order interelectron interaction in two-electron ions are known from Ref. [5] (see also [6]). The higher-order
corrections are much more intricate. Complete QED calculations of the second-order interelectron interaction have
been accomplished for the ground state and for non-degenerate low-lying excited states of He-like and Li-like ions
[7–13].

The other important two-electron corrections are the screened self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections,

which have been evaluated in [14–17] for non-degenerate two- and three-electron conﬁgurations in HCI.

Various general bound-state QED approaches have been employed for the derivation of the energy corrections
in HCI. The one most commonly used is the adiabatic S-matrix approach, developed by Gell-Mann and Low [18],
generalized by Sucher [19] and ﬁrst applied to bound-state QED corrections in Ref. [20] (see also [5]). The other one is
the Green’s function approach, ﬁrst developed in [21] and now applied frequently in a more sophisticated form of the
two-time Green’s function method [22–24]. Finally, the line proﬁle approach (LPA) is utilized for the same purpose
[25,26]. In our previous studies on the QED theory of interelectron interaction in HCI [11,13] this approach has been
applied.

In this paper we generalize the line proﬁle approach to the case of quasi-degenerate electronic states in two-
electron HCI. This problem arises, when a complete QED treatment including the relativistic j–j coupling scheme is
applied to the ﬁne-structure multiplets of systems with intermediate nuclear charge numbers Z. Some components
of the multiplet with equal relativistic quantum numbers turn out to be close enough to each other (the (1s2p)2 1P1,
(1s2p)2 3P1 levels are the standard example).

1

Up to now the QED theory of the quasi-degenerate levels was considered only within the two-time Green’s function
method for the self-energy screening corrections (without any numerical applications) [27], for vacuum-polarization
screening corrections [15] and within the covariant evolution-operator procedure [28] for the second-order interelectron
interaction. Numerical calculations for two-electron ions with Z = 10, 18 [28] are so far the only example where
bound-state QED has been applied to the evaluation of the energy of quasi-degenerate levels taking into account the
interelectron interaction up to second order.

In this work we present an extension of the line proﬁle approach, which is suitable for the evaluation of energies
of any number of the non-degenerate or quasi-degenerate levels. The interelectron interaction corrections up to ﬁrst-
and second-order of QED perturbation theory are evaluated for the (1s2p)2 1P1 and (1s2p)2 3P1 levels in a wide range
of Z values.

II. LINE PROFILE APPROACH

The problem of the natural line proﬁle in atomic physics was considered ﬁrst in terms of quantum mechanics by
Weisskopf and Wigner [29]. In terms of modern QED it was ﬁrst formulated for one-electron atoms by Low [30]. In
[30] the appearance of the Lorentz proﬁle in the resonance approximation within the framework of QED was described
and nonresonant corrections were estimated. Later the line proﬁle QED theory was modiﬁed also for two-electron
atoms [31] (see also [6,32]) and applied to the theory of overlapping resonances in two-electron HCI [33,34]. Another
application was devoted to the theory of nonresonant corrections [35,36].

It was found in [25], that the LPA provides a convenient tool for calculating energy corrections. Moreover, it clearly
determines the limit up to which the concept of the energy of the excited states has a physical meaning – that is the
resonance approximation. The exact theoretical values for the energy of the excited states deﬁned, by the poles in
the Green’s function, can be directly compared with measurable quantities only within the resonance approximation,
where the line proﬁle is described by the two parameters: energy E and width Γ. Beyond this approximation the
evaluation of E and Γ should be replaced by the evaluation of the line proﬁle for the particular process. Moreover,
in the case of two-electron atoms the line proﬁle approach was found to be very eﬃcient for the evaluation of the
reference state correction (reducible part of Feynman graphs) for two-electron atoms [37].

A. Line proﬁle approach for one-electron ions

Consider the simplest process of photon scattering on a one-electron ion which is assumed to be in its ground state
A (Fig. 1). Using the standard Feynman rules for bound-electron QED [6] yields the expression for the S-matrix
element

where ψA(x) = ψA(r)e−i εA t is the wave function of the electron in the ground state, γµ is the Dirac matrix together

The function ΦA(r) can be considered as a vertex function, which describes the absorption of a photon by an electron
in its ground state. Below, we will formulate the resonance approximation, where we can deﬁne the energy and width
of the level which have the general meaning independent of the features of the considered scattering process. Hence,
the energy and the width will not depend on the function ΦA(r) and thus we may consider the function ΦA(r) as
arbitrary. In particular, it can account for the interaction with the free electromagnetic ﬁeld (radiative corrections).

Let us introduce in Eq. (4) the matrix

and integrate over the frequency ωn. Employing the deﬁnition of the transition amplitude U via

we derive the expression for the amplitude

We will consider the resonance case, when the frequency ω is close to the value ωres = εa −
εA + O(α), where a labels
one of the exited states of an ion. In the resonance approximation we have to retain in Eq. (7) only the dominant
term with n = a in the sum over n, i.e.,

Formula (16) deﬁnes the line proﬁle of the process of scattering. Within the resonance approximation the line proﬁle
can be described by a Lorentz contour which is characterized by two parameters: the position of the resonance and
the width. We deﬁne the energy shift for the state a as the shift of the resonance. The energy of the state a is

and the width of the level as the width of the corresponding Lorentz contour at the position of the resonance

We note that the energy E of the level and its width Γ deﬁned in the framework of the resonance approximation do
not depend upon the function T (or ΦA) and, therefore, they do not depend upon the type of the scattering process.
For example, we are free to consider not only the scattering of a photon but of some other particle as well, which
couples to electrons. Going beyond the resonance approximation the line proﬁle can no longer be described by a
Lorentz contour and, consequently, the energy level can not be characterized only by two parameters E and Γ. In
this case the evaluation of the energy levels should be replaced by the evaluation of the particular line proﬁles which,
in general, depend upon the features of scattering process under consideration.

that arises from the Feynman graph in Fig. 3 after application of the adiabatic S-matrix method [38]. The other
second-order electron self-energy (SESE) corrections are irreducible [38].

B. Line proﬁle approach for many-electron ions (non-degenerate energy level)

As in the one-electron case we will consider the process of photon scattering on an ion which is assumed to be in its
lowest (ground) state. Investigating a non-degenerate energy level associated with a conﬁguration containing at least
one 1s-electron (such as (1s2s)21S0, (1s2p1/2)23P0, (1s2s)23S1, (1s)22s1/2, (1s)22p1/2, etc) we can represent the wave
function of the ground state via a proper combination of one-electron Dirac wave functions. A procedure based on
this approach has been accomplished in [11,13]. However, for the investigation of quasi-degenerate levels or a doubly
excited level the interelectron interaction corrections have to be taken into account in the wave function of the ground
state. Here we restrict ourselves to two-electron ions. The generalization to N-electron ions will be presented at the
end of this section.

In the one-electron case we introduced the function ΦA describing the process of scattering under consideration. To
introduce such a function for the two-electron system we may consider ﬁrst the simplest process of photon scattering
on a two-electron ion disregarding the interelectron interaction corrections to the initial (ground) state. This process
is depicted in Fig. 5, where the ground state is represented by two non-interacting electrons one of which absorbs (or
emits) the photon. Accordingly, the ground-state wave function is given by

where ψ1s(x1) = ψ1s(r1)e−i ε1s t1 , ψ1s(x2) are the Dirac one-electron functions with diﬀerent projections of the total
angular momentum. The bar over the one-electron functions indicates the Dirac conjugation.

In order to employ the functions ΨA, ¯ΨA we introduced additional

is absorbed (emitted) by the ﬁrst or by the second electron, respectively. Since the functions ΨA(x1, x2), ¯ΨA(x1, x2)
are antisymmetric it would be suﬃcient to consider one of these terms only.

As in the one-electron case we will look for the position of the resonance and employ the resonance approximation.
It implies the neglect of the non-singular terms (evaluated at the resonance) in comparison with singular ones. The
terms in the sum over n1, n2 in Eq. (28) may contain a singularity at the position of the resonance only if they
correspond to the positive-energy part of the Dirac spectrum. Accordingly, in Eq. (28) we can restrict to the terms
with εn1 > 0, εn2 > 0.

In view of the orthogonality of the Dirac functions and the asymmetry of the functions ΨA and ¯ΨA the ﬁrst term of
Eq. (32) yields exactly Eq. (28). For εn1 > 0 the second term of (32) does not contribute when inserted in Eq. (31).

and can be disregarded.

become more complicated, in particular, the function ΦA(r1, r2) will depend on ωn1, ωn2. Nevertheless, the form of
the expression (34) would remain unchanged.

Below we will employ the resonance approximation deﬁning the energy and width of the level such that they will not
depend upon the features of the particular process of scattering. Since the function ΦA(r1, r2) carries all information
about the process of scattering we can assume it to be arbitrary.

Accordingly, it is convenient to introduce a graphical designation: a rectangle with a letter A inside (see Fig. 6).

Lower and upper rectangles represent the functions ΦA(x1, x2) and ¯ΦA(x1, x2), respectively, which are deﬁned as

ΦA(x1, x2) = ΦA(r1, r2)e−it1(EA +ω)δ(t1 −

Here ΦA(r1, r2) denotes a complicated vertex function describing the scattering process under consideration, EA is
the energy of the ground state, ω, ω′ are the frequencies of the absorbed and emitted photons.

We will look for the position of a resonance near ωres = E(0)

EA + O(α), where E(0) = εa + εb is the energy of two
non-interacting electrons. Applying the identity (32) to Eq. (34) one can see that the delta-function term is singular
close to the resonance, while the other term remains regular (here we assume the function ΦA(r1, r2) to be arbitrary).
The resonance approximation implies the neglect of the non-singular (at the resonance) terms in comparison with
singular ones. Accordingly, within the framework of the resonance approximation the expression for the S-matrix
becomes

into Eq. (54), one can verify that the term with the delta-function coincides with the second element of the geometric
progression for the graph in Fig. 7. Hence, while generating the geometric progression this term will refer to the
second element of the progression.

In order to evaluate rigorously the position of the resonance up to second order in α we have to consider all
corrections of ﬁrst and second order simultaneously. Up to ﬁrst-order of perturbation theory we have to account for
self-energy (SE) and vacuum-polarization (VP) corrections as well as for the exchange of one Coulomb or one Breit
photon. In second order we have to account for all one- and two-electron Feynman graphs of second order including

radiative corrections, screening of the self energy and vacuum polarization and two-photon exchange graphs. However,
the evaluation of the radiative corrections is not the goal of the present work. Below we will present the derivation
of a formula for the one-photon exchange contribution in Fig. 7, the two-photon exchange “box” graph on Fig. 9 (a)
and the three-photon exchange “box” graph Fig. 11.

The scattering amplitude can be written as

Again the summations over g, g′ run over scalar (Coulomb) and transverse (Breit) photons, respectively. The second
term in Eq. (58) represents the remainder after subtracting oﬀ the reference state singularity. This subtraction was
done at the stage of generating the geometric progression with the one-photon exchange insertion. In particular, the
identity (55) was employed for deriving the expression for the reference state contribution (the reducible part) of
the “box” graph, where the delta-function term coincides with the second element of geometric progression for the
one-photon exchange graph.

In the case of one-electron ions the reference state term (see Eq. (22)) appeared only via the derivative term in
Eq. (25). Considering photon exchange in two-electron ions the situation is diﬀerent. In this case a reference state
contribution appears directly in V (2)(ω) (see Eq. (58)) while a derivative term does not arise since V (1) does not
are equivalent, the term corresponding to the reference states
depend on ω. Nevertheless, if the sets

can be expressed as a derivative. At the point of the resonance we can set ω =

Let us now turn to the three-photon exchange correction neglecting retardation eﬀects, crossed-photon graphs and

does not depend on the frequency Ω, which yields

It is important to emphasize that Eq. (64) has the meaning of the correction to the width of the level only if the
full set of Feynman graphs of a given order is under consideration. Indeed, the contribution of the graph in Fig. 7
cancels completely with a part of the contribution of the self-energy correction, while the vacuum polarization gives
zero contribution to the width. Such a cancellation is an immediate consequence of the Pauli principle according to
which transitions of electrons into occupied states are prohibited [39].

We note that the two-electron graphs to the ﬁrst order in V (1) does not depend on ω. Hence, the solution of Eq. (62)

contribution of the reference states occurring in these graphs. The third-order term V (3)(εa −
εA) contributes to the
three-photon exchange graphs in Fig. 11. It does not contain the contribution of the reference states because we
disregard the retardation eﬀects considering it within the framework of relativistic many-body perturbation theory
(RMBPT). The derivative term in Eq. (65) as well as that term in Eq. (25) does not correspond to a certain Feynman
graph. Similar to Eq. (25) it can be related to the contribution of the reducible part (reference states) of the graph
in Fig. 11.

Let us mention that if we would take into account in addition the radiative corrections and as well as screening
eﬀects, we would obtain a corresponding correction V (1)(ω) containing the contribution of the electron self energy
(13), the one-photon exchange (57) and the vacuum polarization. For V (2)(ω) we would similarly obtain the sum of
Eqs. (22), (58) and in addition all the missing radiative eﬀects of second order together with the screened self-energy
and vacuum-polarization corrections. Accordingly, instead of Eq. (65) we would have been left with

C. Line proﬁle approach for many-electron ions (quasi-degenerate energy levels)

We now turn to the application of the line proﬁle approach to quasi-degenerate levels. Without loss of generality, we
can restrict ourselves to two mixing conﬁgurations. We will search for the positions of the resonances corresponding
to these conﬁgurations and will construct basic wave functions Ψ1 and Ψ2 within the j–j coupling scheme. The
energies corresponding to these wave functions are denoted by E
and they are supposed to be close to the
exact energies of the electron conﬁgurations under consideration. Employing the line proﬁle approach we will consider
a scattering of a photon on a two-electron ion in its ground state A. The positions of resonances may be found near
the values ωres
EA + O(α), respectively. Within the resonance approximation
we will have to retain two terms in the sum (42) corresponding to the basic functions Ψ1 and Ψ2. The scattering
amplitude may be written as

Note, that employing the resonance approximation in case of non-degenerate level we have to retain in a correspond-
ing sum (42) certain many-electron functions composed within the j–j coupling scheme. Indeed, after diagonalization
of the matrix V all other combinations of one-electron functions will yield zero in view of the antisymmetry of the
wave function of the ground state and the symmetry of the matrix V . Hence, having constructed a many-electron
function in the j–j coupling scheme, Eq. (56) becomes a scalar one.

The line proﬁle approach outlined above can be easily employed for an arbitrary number of degenerate levels. The

generalization of the method to N -electron ions was described at the end of the previous section.

III. EVALUATION OF THE ENERGY LEVELS OF QUASI-DEGENERATE TWO-ELECTRON
CONFIGURATIONS

We will evaluate the interelectron interaction correction for the two-electron conﬁgurations (1s2p)21P1 and
(1s2p)23P1. Employing the relativistic j–j coupling scheme these energy levels become quasi-degenerate in the region
Z
40. To treat such states within the framework of QED we will apply the line proﬁle approach. Within the j–j
coupling scheme the wave function of a two-electron conﬁguration can be represented as

where the normalization constant is N = 1/2 for equivalent electrons and N = 1/√2 for non-equivalent electrons,
respectively. Cj1j2
JM (m1m2) is a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient. The one-electron Dirac functions ψjlm(r) are characterized
by the standard set of one-electron quantum numbers: total angular momentum j, its projection m and the orbital
angular momentum l, that ﬁxes the parity of the state. For the two-electron wave function the relevant quantum
numbers are the total angular momentum J and its projection M .

Following the procedure described in Section II C we will construct the matrix V (73) on the functions (81)

As it has been elaborated in Section II the operator V , in general, depends on ω. The position of the resonance
EA + ε1s + ε2p1/2 and
EA + ε1s + ε2p3/2 (see Eq. (65)). For the practical calculations it is convenient to expand some matrix elements
keeping only terms O(α2) in both expansions. The resulting
ε2p3/2

can be derived via Taylor expansion at the approximate positions of the resonances ωres
ωres
of V at the point ωres
inaccuracy can be referred to corrections O(α3) [24], because at low Z values the energy diﬀerence ε2p1/2 −
becomes small, while at large-Z values the degeneracy of the levels 21P1, 23P1 is nearly negligible.

The interelectron interaction correction is represented by the set of graphs (Figs. 7 and 9) which is symmetric under
interchange of the upper and the lower indices and relabeling of the electrons in the graphs. Accordingly, the operator
V is given by a symmetric (and in general complex) matrix. However, as a consequence of performing the Taylor
expansion of the matrix elements of V and neglecting third- and higher-orders terms it can lead to a non-symmetrical
matrix. To prevent this asymmetry arising due to purely technical reasons one may symmetrize the matrix V by
hand.

Hence, the matrix elements of the frequency-dependent operator V evaluated at the resonances can be written as

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND THEIR ANALYSIS

The results of the numerical calculations are presented in Tables I, II. To account for nuclear size corrections we
solved the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential generated by a nuclear charge density described by a Fermi
distribution. The parameters of the Fermi distribution are taken from Ref. [13].

In Table I we present a detailed analysis of our results obtained for the photon-exchange contribution. The value
V (0) is the binding energy of the 2p state according to Eq. (89), the value V (1) corresponds to the one-photon exchange
contribution Eq. (90) and V (2) represents the two-photon exchange contributions given by Eqs. (91–94). We note,
that, in general, the matrix V has complex elements and both their real and imaginary parts contribute to the energy
eigenvalues, i.e., the real part of the diagonalized matrix V . In our calculation the imaginary part of V (1) is taken into
account, while the imaginary part of the two-photon exchange contribution (V (2)) is neglected. The values Ex(21P1)
and Ex(23P1) denote the photon-exchange contribution to the energies of the corresponding electron conﬁgurations
(neglecting the radiative corrections). For Z = 10, 18 we present also the values for the diﬀerence between the energies
of the levels under consideration reported in Ref. [28].

In order to analyse the inﬂuence of the quasi-degeneracy on QED eﬀects in more detail we compile the corresponding
energy shifts of the levels due to the photon-exchange contribution calculated within various approximations. The

15

diﬀerences between the energies of the levels calculated without the approximations and the energies calculated within
the framework of the approximations are presented in Table I [∆Ex(21,3P1): Appr. 1-5].

Approximation 1: We omit the non-diagonal elements of the matrix V = V (0) + V (1) + V (2). Consequently, eﬀects

of the quasi-degeneracy are totally neglected.

Approximation 2: We omit the non-diagonal elements only in the matrix V (2). As stated above the expression for
the one-photon exchange correction (90) does not depend on ω and coincides with the one for the non-degenerate case.
Accordingly, the ﬁrst-order contribution is taken into account just as the solution of the secular equation, i.e. following
usual techniques developed in quantum mechanics for treating degenerate levels. The inﬂuence of quasi-degeneracy
due to the second-order matrix element V (2) is neglected.

Approximation 3: We calculate the matrix elements of V within the framework of RMBPT. Compared with the
full ab initio QED calculation the following contributions are missing: 1) negative-energy intermediate states, 2)
crossed-photon interaction, 3) rigorous treatment of retardation eﬀects. As mentioned above within the framework
of RMBPT no contribution due to reference states (for two-photon exchange) arises. Accordingly, the energies of the
levels just follow as solutions of the secular equation.

Approximation 4: Only the matrix elements of V (2) are evaluated within the framework of RMBPT. According to

the comment made on approximation 2, this also follows the quantum mechanical treatment for quasi-degeneracy.

Approximation 5: We neglect the imaginary part of the elements of the matrix V . The matrix V deﬁned in Eq. (73)
is a complex one. Although the energy of the level is deﬁned as the real part of the diagonalized matrix V (ω) at the
point of the resonance (ω = ωres), the imaginary part of the elements of the matrix V (non-diagonal) contributes to
the energy.

The results in Table I demonstrate that for the 21P1, 23P1 levels a complete ab initio QED theory for describing
the quasi-degeneracy has to be employed only when going beyond the level of second-order corrections. For Z < 30
approximation 3 provides an accuracy of about 1% at the level of second-order perturbation theory. Accordingly, the
inaccuracy can be referred to corrections of third order. For Z < 60
70 approximation 4 leads to an inaccuracy
∼
70 the eﬀect of quasi-degeneracy decreases
comparable in magnitude with the corrections of third order. For Z > 60
deﬁnitely to the level of third-order corrections. Consequently, approximation 2 can be employed for high-Z systems.
For Z > 80 the quasi-degeneracy becomes completely negligible, i.e., it will be suﬃcient to employ approximation
1. The contribution of imaginary parts of the matrix elements V to the energy levels appears as an eﬀect of quasi-
degeneracy, which originates completely from QED. It is perceptible only for high Z > 70, which also reveals that the
neglect of the imaginary part of V (2) has been legitimate.

∼

In Table II we present the data for the total energies of the 21P1 and 23P1 two-electron conﬁgurations, respectively.
The numbers present the ionization energy of the 2p-electron with the opposite sign. These data are compared with
the results obtained by Plante et al. [2] and Drake [1]. Two diﬀerent approximate methods have been employed in
these works: the “relativistic all-order theory” (AO) [2] and “the uniﬁed theory” [1]. The latter methods account
approximately for QED eﬀects, such as retardation, crossed-photon graphs and negative-energy intermediate states,
while taking into account partially higher-orders of the perturbation theory. In the present work the photon exchange
is taken into account up to the second order. The self-energy (SE) and vacuum-polarization (VP) corrections are
included only in ﬁrst order. Quantitative results for SE and VP corrections are taken from Refs. [40–42,3]. The SE
and VP screening corrections, the radiative corrections of the second order and all the corrections of the third and
higher orders are omitted. We note, that the VP screening corrections for the states considered have been evaluated
by Artemyev et al. [15], while results for the SE screening corrections are not yet available. Since the SE and VP
screening corrections partially cancel each other, we do not include the results of [15] in Table II. In Table III we
21P1 transition energies. We conclude that the discrepancy
present various theoretical and experimental data for 23P1 −
between our data and those from other results arising for small values of Z is caused by third- and higher-orders of
the perturbation theory which have not been accounted for in the present paper. For high Z the major inaccuracy is
due to missing self-energy, vacuum-polarization screening corrections and one-electron radiative corrections of second
order.

TABLE I. Matrix elements of the operator V for the two-electron conﬁgurations 21P1 and 23P1 (eV). The individual contribu-
tions for the Dirac-binding energies of 2p-electron states (V (0)), the one-photon exchange contribution (V (1)) and the two-photon
contribution (V (2)) are compiled, respectively. Ex(21P1), Ex(23P1) are the energies of the corresponding conﬁgurations, where
only the photon-exchange contributions are taken into account (neglecting radiative corrections).

TABLE II. Data for the energies (in eV) of the conﬁgurations 21P1 and 23P1. Photon-exchange corrections are taken into
account up to second order in α. Self-energy (SE) and vacuum-polarization (VP) corrections are taken into account only in
ﬁrst order. The one-electron radiative corrections of order α2 , the SE and VP screening corrections and all the corrections of
the third and higher orders are omitted. The data are compared with the results of Plante et al. [2] and Drake [1].

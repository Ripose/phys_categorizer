(Dated: January 17, 2014)

The relation between the jump length probability distribution function and the spec-

tral line proﬁle in resonance atomic radiation trapping is considered for Partial Frequency

Redistribution (PFR) between absorbed and reemitted radiation. The single line Opacity

Distribution Function [M.N. Berberan-Santos et.al. J. Chem. Phys. 125, 174308, 2006] is

generalized for PFR and used to discuss several possible redistribution mechanisms (pure

Doppler broadening, combined natural and Doppler broadening and combined Doppler, nat-

ural and collisional broadening).

It is shown that there are two coexisting scales with a

diﬀerent behavior: the small scale is controlled by the intricate PFR details while the large

scale is essentially given by the atom rest frame redistribution asymptotic. The pure Doppler

and combined natural, Doppler and collisional broadening are characterized by both small

and large scale superdiﬀusive L´evy ﬂight behaviors while the combined natural and Doppler

case has an anomalous small scale behavior but a diﬀusive large scale asymptotic. The com-

mon practice of assuming complete redistribution in core radiation and frequency coherence

in the wings of the spectral distribution is incompatible with the breakdown of superdiﬀusion

in combined natural and Doppler broadening conditions.

INTRODUCTION

The study of transport phenomena [1] and in particular of diﬀusion processes [2] has

developed considerably in the course of the last decades. One of the foundations of this

area is the well-known diﬀusion equation, consequence of the central limit theorem [3], that

describes the random motion of a particle in an isotropic homogeneous three-dimensional

space. The Probability Density Function (PDF) of the diﬀusing species being at a certain

position r at time t, after a suﬃciently high number of jumps and for an initial location

at r = 0, is given by the propagator [4, 5]

W (r, t) ∝

with the root mean square displacement,

r2 (t)
(cid:11)
(cid:10)

= 6Dt,

where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the diﬀusing species.

By the end of the last century it was recognized that the simple behavior in Eqs. (1)

and (2) was not completely general. The two most widely known deviations from the standard

diﬀusive behavior are L´evy ﬂights [6, 7], coined and popularized by Benoit Maldelbrot, and

Richardson’s law of turbulent diﬀusion [8]. Recently, anomalous diﬀusion equations were

also found to apply to in the econometric modeling and/or prediction [9], in laser cooling

of atoms [10], in the foraging behavior of some animals [11], and to the the scaling laws

ruling human travel activities (critically connected to the geographical spreading of infectious

diseases) [12].

Situations deviating from the classical diﬀusion case can heuristically be described by a

modiﬁed power law giving the scaling of the mean squared displacement as

(cid:11)
Anomalous diﬀusion results in the departure of the γ factor from unity in the last equation,

(cid:10)

r2 (t)

∝ tγ.

(3)

owing to the non applicability of the classical central limit theorem, as a result of the presence

2

of broad distributions or long-range correlations and non-local eﬀects [5, 13]. Broad spatial

jump or waiting time distributions lead to a non-Gaussian and possibly a non-Markovian

time and spatial evolution of the system [4, 5], giving rise to anomalous behaviors that can

be collectively described as strange kinetics [14].

Equation (3) encompasses both the linear dependence of the mean squared displacement

with time (γ = 1) characteristic of the standard Brownian motion as well as nonlinear de-

pendencies, slower (γ < 1) and faster (γ > 1) than the classical case. The below Browian

motion regime is usually named sub-diﬀusion or dispersive motion while the above range is

known as hyper or superdiﬀusion. In order to generalize the classical treatment to consider

anomalous diﬀusion, the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model is often considered.

The random trajectory is viewed as the result of pairwise stochastically independent spatial

and temporal increment events. When both the variance of the spatial steps and the expecta-

tion value of the temporal increments are ﬁnite, CTRW is equivalent to Brownian motion on

large spatio-temporal scales [5] and yields ordinary diﬀusion. Nevertheless, for the anomalous

diﬀusion, a bifractional diﬀusion equation can be derived for the dynamics of W (r, t). This

can be solved using the methods of fractional calculus to give

W (r, t) ∼

(cid:16)

where Lµ is a one-sided L´evy stable law of index µ [13]. This equation implies that the

mean squared displacement scales as

p (r) ∼

(1+µ).

The particle’s motion can be classiﬁed either as a L´evy ﬂight, in the case that the time-

of-ﬂight of each jump in the trajectory is negligible, or as a L´evy walk, if the ﬁnite time to

complete each jump must be taken into account [5, 14].

In this work we are interested in the stochastic theory of atomic resonance radiation mi-

gration under which the trajectories are of the supperdiﬀusive type. The radiation transport

is usually described in terms of a master equation, which has an integro-diﬀerential form

taking into account non-local eﬀects [15]. This is usually known as the Holstein-Biberman

3

(4)

(5)

equation, named after seminal contributions in the 1940s [16, 17, 18]. It was shown, ﬁrst using

ad hoc arguments [19] and later demonstrated, that the motion of photons is superdiﬀusive.

This was initially demonstrated for Doppler and Lorentz spectral line shapes and recently

generalized for any line shape [15]. The work was done in the limit of Complete Frequency

Redistribution (CFR), a situation in which the collision rate is suﬃciently high when com-

pared to the lifetime of the excited state to destroy any correlation between photon absorption

and (re)emission events. This contribution aims to extend the previous work and discuss the

inﬂuence of Partial Frequency Redistribution (PFR) eﬀects in the stochastic description of

the resonance radiation trajectories. We will show that the overall asymptotic behavior of the

trajectories is dictated by the redistribution in the rest frame of the atom, even if in the lab

rest frame memory eﬀects persist in a ﬁner scale. Speciﬁcally, we will show that the Doppler

or Lorentz CFR superdiﬀusive asymptotics are recovered for PFR if there is only Doppler or

Doppler plus natural redistribution in the atom frame. On the contrary, we show for the ﬁrst

time, that the complete coherence in the atom’s rest frame will manifest itself as a breakdown

of the superdiﬀusive behavior in all cases and not only for the wing frequencies events.

In Sec. II the Partial Frequency Redistribution (PFR) eﬀects are introduced along with

the notation to be used.

In Sec. III the single line Opacity Distribution Function (ODF)

under PFR is deﬁned. This is subsequently used to derive the the large scale asymptotics of the

jump length distribution in Sec. IV and of the opacity distribution in Sec. V. Section VI makes

a connection between the superdiﬀusive character and the low opacity asymptotic behavior

of the ODF. In Sec. VII numerical results are presented for the ODFs and the conditional

jump length probability distribution functions, and the inﬂuence of frequency redistribution

in both a small scale (controlled by PFR eﬀects) as well as in a large scale (corresponding

to either a CFR superdiﬀusive or, in alternative, a diﬀusive) asymptotic are discussed. The

main conclusions are summarized at the end (Sec. VIII).

II. PARTIAL FREQUENCY REDISTRIBUTION

Resonance radiation trapping can be envisaged as a random ﬂight with a jump size distri-

bution dependent upon the spectral line shape. If all the scattering (absorption followed by

reemission) events are coherent in frequency, the radiation transport is described by a diﬀu-

4

sion equation with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient dependent on the mean free path of the radiation.

However, reabsorption-reemission events are inelastic, and a photon frequency redistribution

in the lab reference frame exists preventing the notion of a mean free path. Therefore, the

topology of the excitation random trajectory has to be related with the frequency redistribu-

tion of the emitted photons, since the jump length Probability Distribution Function (PDF)

must consider all possible optical emission frequencies. This can be done as [19]

malized by dividing by the corresponding width parameter (given for the Doppler and Lorentz

c and WLor = Γ/4π, respectively, with vmp the most probable
thermal velocity and Γ the radiative rate constant), Θ (x) is the emission spectrum lineshape,

p (r|x) the photon exponential (Beer-Lambert) jump distribution, and Φ (x) is the normalized

absorption lineshape of the resonance line( so that

Φ (x) dx). The dimensionless distance

r = k0

Φ(0) deﬁnes an opacity or optical density scale from the center-of-line optical depth k0
and the center-of-line absorption coeﬃcient Φ (0). For a suﬃciently high number of collisions

+

∞
−∞

R

during the lifetime of excited atoms, the emitted photon has a frequency completely uncor-

related with the absorption frequency and so the radiation is completely redistributed over

the entire spectral line. This corresponds to the Complete Frequency Redistribution (CFR)

case, for which the emission and absorption line shapes coincide and the jump length PDF is

independent of the past history. For strong resonance lines with short lifetimes the frequency

redistribution is partial since only a few collisions occur before emission, and consequently

the stochastic nature of the distribution must be considered. Partial Frequency Redistribu-

tion (PFR) eﬀects are important in an astrophysical context, as is the case of the scattering

of Lyα radiation in optically thick nebulae [20] and the Ca I resonance line in the solar

spectrum [21], as well as in lab scale atomic vapors, notably the 185 nm mercury line in

low-pressure lighting discharges (which can account for as many as 10% of the overall ﬂux

in a typical T12 ﬂuorescence lamp) [22] and the 147 and 129 nm Xe VUV radiation used

in Plasma Display Pannels (PDPs) applications [23, 24]. For both mercury and xenon, the

5

natural lifetimes of the corresponding excited states are less than about 3 ns and therefore

only at very high densities is the collision rate high enough to approach CFR conditions.

For a two-level model in the CFR limit, both absorption and emission spectra lineshapes

can be described by Doppler – ΦDop (x) = 1
Voigt – ΦV oigt (x) = a

1+x2 –, or

characteristic width, a ratio of the Lorentz to the Doppler widths deﬁned previously. The

study of PFR was pioneered in the 1940s in an astrophysical context and we will use the

notation introduced by Hummer in the early 1960s [25]. PFR is described by a redistribution

R function which is the joint probability of absorption of a x′ photon and reemission of a

x frequency photon. This redistribution function is derived for a thermal vapor, assuming a

Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for ground state atoms and further imposing that

the atoms velocity is unchanged upon excitation (assumption not valid for ultracold vapors).

We will further consider unpolarized radiation (scalar redistribution function), use the an-

gle averaged redistribution for an isotropic angular distribution reemission and discuss the

three most important cases for a ground state absorbing state: (i) pure Doppler broaden-

ing (RI ), (ii) combined natural and Doppler broadening (RII ) and (iii) combined Doppler,

natural and collisional broadening (RIII ) [16, 20, 26, 27] . For the RI case, both levels are

inﬁnitely sharp and there is pure coherent scattering in the Atom’s Rest Frame (ARF). This

is unrealistic because both the lower and upper levels of the optical transition are broadened

to some extent by radiation damping and/or collisions. It is nevertheless useful since it allows

the separation of the Doppler shift from the other broadening mechanisms. The physical

picture for RII is a line with an inﬁnitely sharp lower level and an upper level broadened only

by radiation damping. In the ARF the absorption is Lorentzian and scattering is completely

(frequency) coherent. This type of scattering is important for resonance lines in low density

media where the collisions do not perturb the excited levels. RIII applies whenever the up-

per state is broadened by radiation and collision damping in the limit where collisions are

frequent enough to cause complete frequency redistribution in the ARF. Both absorption and

reemission proﬁles are Lorentzian in the atom’s frame with a total width equal to the sum

of the radiative plus collisional (uncorrelated) characteristic widths. It is well known that

complete redistribution in the ARF does not imply the same quantitative behavior in the lab

6

frame used to describe radiation transport. Under the previously mentioned assumptions, the

lab frame joint redistribution functions are given by [26, 28]

where a is the total width, erfc is the complementary error function, and x and x stand

In Eq. (6) we need to use the (re)emission PDF. For radiation transport in thermal va-

pors we can assume a CFR absorption proﬁle which corresponds to the ensemble average

over the Maxwellian velocity distribution. The reemission distribution comes from the joint

redistribution probability and, according to Bayes rule, is given by

and it is this conditional (re)emission PDF that should be used. Φ (x′) is the absorp-

tion spectrum PDF which should be either the pure Doppler distribution (RI ) or the Voigt

proﬁle (RII and RIII).

Figures 1 to 3 show the spectral distributions calculated from the previous equations. Both

RI and RIII distributions are symmetric, while RII is asymmetric. In all cases, a complete

redistribution in the ARF does not imply CFR in the lab frame, the degree of redistribution

in the lab frame being always bigger for core radiation and for the RI and RIII cases. The

complete coherence in the atom’s rest frame for the RII model is not complete in the lab frame.

However, the coherence degree is more retained for wing photons and higher a values (bigger

importance of natural coherent broadening compared to Doppler). On the other hand, for the

RIII distribution, the increase of the a value implies higher redistribution in the core (bigger

importance of collisional redistributed broadening). We will discuss now the inﬂuence of the

redistribution between absorption and reemission in the asymptotic superdiﬀusive character

of photon migration under PFR conditions. For this purpose we extend the concept of a single

line opacity distribution function for incomplete redistribution.

III. LINE OPACITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION UNDER PARTIAL

REDISTRIBUTION

To study the superdiﬀusive behavior of resonance radiation trapping it is convenient to dis-

cuss the inﬂuence of the line shape in the Opacity (probability) Distribution Function (ODF).

For that we will use a line opacity scale, deﬁned from the normalized absorption line shape

as k ≡ Φ (x). This line opacity scale will thus have no reference to the actual system size

or number density and will be useful only for inﬁnite media. This is the one chosen to

discuss the ODF. The monochromatic line opacity along a given pathlength l, for homoge-

neously distributed particles, is k (x) = nσ0lΦ (x) /Φ (0) = k0Φ (x) /Φ (0) = Φ (x) r and is

therefore proportional to the number density n (or the pressure) and to the center-of-line

opacity k0 = nσ0l. σ0 is the center-of-line absorption cross section as usual. The discus-

We will now generalize the basic procedure used previously [15] for the complete frequency

distribution to cover the partial frequency distribution (PFR) case. We will start with the

jump length PDF by rewriting Eq. (6) making explicit the conditional dependence in the

the inverse Laplace transform of p (r|x′). The inversion is analytical and can be performed

using the real inversion form of the Laplace transform (with the parameter c = 0) [29],

This is the general workhorse that will be used in the following sections to discuss the

inﬂuence of PFR in resonance radiation reabsorption and compare it with the CFR case [15].

We will show how the redistribution of the emission into the wings of the absorption spectrum

implies a superdiﬀusive behavior characterized by a very broad (inﬁnite mean) jump size

distribution. In addition, we are able to demonstrate that, if redistribution into the tails of

the absorption is prevented due to PFR memory eﬀects, the superdiﬀusive character breaks

down, and this can be seen in a cut-oﬀ in the PDF of the opacity at small line opacity values

that is translated into a corresponding cut-oﬀ of the higher jump lengths.

Two of the PFR cases deﬁned before (RI and RIII ) have symmetric reemission PDFs (see

For PFR conditions, we have to consider both the absorption as well as the conditional

We can obtain the same conclusions from the spectral and from the ODF PDFs asymp-

totics. Indeed, the small opacity scaling law can be easily obtained from the previous equa-

tions. From Eqs. (22) and (23), one obtains

Using the reemission asymptotic of Eq. (26), the ODF small opacity limit is

The cases of CFR Doppler and Lorentz resonance line radiation transfer give analytical

ODF expressions and were considered in previous works [15, 19]. For the Doppler case, one

has µ ≃ 1 and thus Eq. (22) is only approximately valid and the dependence of the ODF

over the opacity values is extremely weak. However, for Lorentz, the asymptotic in Eq. (22)

is exact with p = 2. The ODF is given by [15]

VI. SUPERDIFFUSIVE BEHAVIOR FOR RESONANCE LINE TRAPPING

Although the superdiﬀusive behavior is well established from the asymptotics derived in

the previous two sections, a simpler more informative, alternative approach is possible. Equa-

tion (12) can be written in Laplace space as

ˆp

and since the moments of the jump size distribution can be recast from the mth derivatives

u=0 = (−1)m hrmi, one obtains
of this Laplace transform as ˆp(m) (u|x′)

The integration only goes up to the upper limit of the center-of-line opacity. The ﬁrst

inﬁnite mean jump size is obtained.

the mean jump size is inﬁnite irrespective of the actual value of the p parameter.

VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Figures 4 to 6 give the conditional ODFs for the three PFR redistribution mechanisms

considered in this work alongside with the corresponding CFR Doppler and Lorentz limiting

cases. The results were computed from Eqs. (16) and (17). The CFR ODFs allow one

to quantify very easily the cause of the superdiﬀusive behavior for resonance line radiation

trapping; for very small opacities, the ODF either decreases very slowly (Doppler) or even

16

increases in importance (Lorentz) with a decrease in opacity values. It does not vanish in

the limit of k → 0 and therefore superdiﬀusion sets in (see previous section). From Eq. (12),

one can see that the slower the decrease in the ODF for smaller opacity values, the more

important the higher jump sizes. For Doppler, Lorentz (and Voigt) CFR trapping, the ODF

variation for small k values is either increasing or so slowly decreasing as to render even the

ﬁrst moment of the jump size distribution inﬁnite [15, 19]. The CFR Voigt case is a self-aﬃne

multifractal with two diﬀerent characteristic L´evy ﬂight µ’s parameters, a µ ≃ 1 corresponding

to the Doppler-like core radiation and a µ = 1/2 for Lorentz-like wing photons. The overall

excitation random walk topology is controlled by the bigger Lorentz scale (if not truncated

by the vapor conﬁning boundaries) [19]. Therefore, in the present case of PFR eﬀects in an

inﬁnite medium, and even for the Voigt Maxwellian absorption proﬁle, we need only concern

ourselves with the PFR deviation from the most extreme Lorentz CFR asymptotic.

Figure 4 shows that the superdiﬀusive character of RI partial redistribuion is similar to the

one for the corresponding Doppler CFR case. There is a transition between two regimes: (i) the

central core constant redistribution (compare Fig. 1), characterized by a faster than Lorentz

increase of opacity PDF for small opacity values, and (ii) the wings Doppler-like redistribution,

with a Doppler-like (albeit with a slower convergence) asymptotic. The transition between the

two regimes depends upon the actual value of the previous absorption frequency x′ (for x′ = 4

and 5, the transition still occurs but at opacity values smaller than the ones represented in

Fig. 4).

The RI case is useful because it allows one to single out the pure Doppler eﬀect on the

redistribution functions. The more realistic cases are described by the RII or RIII distri-

butions. Figure 5 show the conditional ODFs for the RIII redistribution for representative

values of the a parameter found in experimental conditions. The PFR random walk has a su-

perdiﬀusive character with the same asymptotic of the CFR Lorentz. For the RIII combined

Doppler, natural and collisional broadening, there is complete (Lorentzian) redistribution in

the atom’s rest frame, but not in the lab frame. One can distinguish mainly two regimes, one

for very small line opacities and the other for opacities approaching the center-of-line value,

the exact transition between the two depending upon the a parameter. For very small line

opacities, the actual superdiﬀusive regime corresponds to the CFR Lorentz case. For higher

line opacities, the redistribution is similar to RI ; an initial step increase in ODF PDF with

decreasing opacity, followed by a Doppler-like asymptotic (which eventually merges into the

Lorentz higher scale asymptotic [15]). The a parameter quantiﬁes the relative importance

of Lorentz (natural plus collisional in this case) over Doppler; the higher the a value the

more important the Lorentz complete redistribution in the atom’s rest frame and therefore

the smaller the deviations from CFR and the onset of the CFR Lorentz asymptotic occurs

earlier (ie., for higher opacity values).

The conditional ODFs for the RII redistribution are shown in Fig. 6. The most remarkable

diﬀerence from the previous cases resides in the low line opacity asymptotic. There is a very

abrupt cut-oﬀ of the ODF PDF values for small opacities which scales approximately as a.

This case corresponds to excited levels not perturbed by collisions during their lifetime and

coherent reemission in the Atom’s Rest Frame (ARF). This coherent reemission in the ARF

does not give automatically coherence in the Lab Rest Frame (LRF) due to the Maxwell

velocity distribution. However, after several Doppler widths (depending on a), the ARF

coherency appears in the cut-oﬀ of the ODF. As for the previous RIII case, two regimes

can be distinguished, with a transition between them that depends on a. For line opacities

approaching the center-of-line value, Φ0, the redistribution is similar to the pure Doppler

RI case; an initial very steep (faster than Lorentzian and persisting to smaller line opacities

the more oﬀ-center is the previous photon absorption) increase with decreasing opacity value

followed by a CFR Doppler redistribution until the small opacities approaching the cut-oﬀ

values (compare the CFR asymptotic with the ODF curves for the x′ = 0, 1 and 2 cases).

The cut-oﬀ of the ODF PDF for the smaller line opacities is very important since it shows

the breakdown of the superdiﬀusion character for this RII model.

From the above results some general conclusions can be extracted: (i) the ARF frequency

coherence does not immediately give rise to LRF coherence due to the ensemble Maxwellian

velocity distribution averaging and (ii) the ARF redistribution (or non redistribution) char-

acter will eventually show up as a corresponding LRF asymptotic for suﬃciently small line

opacities (that is to say, for optically thick enough vapors). The CFR in the ARF for the RIII

will give rise to a Lorentz CFR (superdiﬀusive) asymptotic in inﬁnite media even under par-

tial redistribution while the complete coherence in the ARF for RII will reveal itself in the

LRF as a breakdown of the superdiﬀusive charater. The breakdown of the superdiﬀusion for

thick vapors under RII conditions is particularly important due to the widespread practice

of reducing the actual complex behavior of the RII redistribution into a linear superposition

of complete frequency redistribution in the line core plus a complete coherence in the line

wings. This practice is essentially motivated by the mathematical simpliﬁcation that it allows

and it can be traced back to the work of Jeﬀeries and White [30] (and it is therefore known

as the JW-approximation). Although the several implementations of the JW-approximation

diﬀerentiate the photons from the core from those from the wings, all ignore the possibility

that even the most extreme wing photons can be redistributed in frequency, thus neglecting

the so-called “difusion” in frequency. Moreover, the full redistribution function is skewed

towards the line center and this is not taken into account. Figure 6 clearly shows another

physical limitation of the JW-approximations which is generally not pointed out. For high

opacity samples, the CFR assumption in core radiation is a severe approximation since CFR

implies that radiation well into the wings can be emitted in a single scattering event, which

can not occur (an upper limit exists) due to the breakdown of the Doppler asymptotic. This

contributes to show that the JW-type approximations are only acceptable for small Voigt

parameters and for overall center-of-line opacities roughly smaller than 100 − 500 [16, 24, 31].

FIG. 6: Conditional Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) for Partial Redistribution function RII for
several previous absorption frequencies x′ and Voigt width parameters a. The Complete Redistribution

limiting Doppler and Lorentz cases are also shown.

The asymptotic analysis of resonance radiation trapping started probably with Holstein

seminal work [18] and received afterwards a relevant contribution from van Trigt’s inﬁnite

opacity expansion analysis in the 1970s [32]. Asymptotic analysis is a very useful tool to

calculate the large-scale behavior, which, from the derived scaling laws, can provide physical

insight into more complex and realistic conditions. This is particularly true for partial redis-

tribution in the LRF. We clearly show that the large scale behavior is of the CFR Lorentz

superdiﬀusive type for complete redistribution in the ARF but of the diﬀusive character if

the excited atom is intrinsically coherent (even if the small scale resembles the pure Doppler

superdiﬀusive character). So, one can use a generalized diﬀusive transport equation [5] for line

radiation in this case, even if the eﬀective mean transport coeﬃcients will hide the details of

the small scale partial redistribution eﬀects. The present work is in this respect complemen-

tary of the asymptotic analysis of the integral equation of line radiation transfer carried out

by Frisch [20, 33]. The work presented here is much simpler and straightforward than Frisch’s

approach. Furthermore, we clearly identify the CFR in the line core JW-type approximation

for RII as incompatible with the large scale diﬀusive behavior.

Figures 7 to 9 give the jump size PDFs computed numerically from Eq. (11). These give

essentially the same information as the ODF PDFs, although in terms of the overall opacity

length which is directly related to physical distances (for an additional note on the relation of

opacity scales and physical distances, see ref. [15]). The superdiﬀusive behavior of RI and RIII

is evident, while the breakdown of superdiﬀusion is manifested by the abrupt cut-oﬀ for RII at

higher jump lengths. Smaller details can also be pointed out. For RI, there is an initial higher

than superdiﬀusive Lorentz jump PDF which changes into the large scale Doppler asymptotic

at high distances (transition not shown but conﬁrmed for the last two cases of x′ = 4 and 5

in Fig. 7). For the RIII redistribution, all cases converge into the same Lorentzian CFR. And

ﬁnally, for the RII case there are three characteristic jump length ranges; a ﬁrst in which

the jump PDF increases faster for decreasing opacities than CFR Lorentz, an intermediate

with a CFR Doppler character (and these two distance ranges roughly correspond to the pure

Doppler RI case) and a third one corresponding to the diﬀusive onset due to a step cut-oﬀ

for higher distances.

The jump size PDFs deﬁne the overall opacity scale in which partial frequency redistri-

bution eﬀects are important as well as the transition from superdiﬀusion-like into standard

diﬀusion for the RII case. From Fig. 8 one expects that the onset of CFR Lorentz asymptotic

for high opacities should roughly scale with the width a parameter; PFR eﬀects should man-

ifest themselves at distances up to 105, 104 and 103 for a = 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1, respectively,

when measured in a dimensionless overall opacity scale. On the other hand, in the case of RII

redistribution, Fig. 9 shows that the standard diﬀusion should become noticeable only at very

high opacities; roughly 106, 105 and 104 for a = 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. At smaller

scales, and notably for ﬁnite systems with the biggest dimension not exceeding these opacity

values, the faster than standard diﬀusion behavior is dominant.

VIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The line Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) approach was used to discuss the su-

perdiﬀusive character of resonance line radiation transfer under Partial Frequency Redistri-

butions (PFR) eﬀects, as well as the conditions for its breakdown. These eﬀects are the result

of the ensemble average from the atom’s rest frame (ARF) redistribution function into the

lab frame (used to describe radiation transport). We discuss PFR eﬀects for three frequency

redistribution functions between absorption and reemission: RI (pure Doppler broadening),

RII (Doppler plus natural) and RIII (combined Doppler, natural and collisional broadening).

The Doppler ARF of RI will give rise to the Complete Frequency Redistribution (CFR) su-

perdiﬀusive Doppler asymptotic for suﬃciently small line opacities, while the Lorentz ARF

intrinsics of RIII give also small line opacity large scale Lorentzian CFR superdiﬀusive asymp-

totics. However, the ARF frequency coherence of RII gives rise to a diﬀerent behavior, be-

cause the abrupt cut-oﬀ in the jump size distribution for higher distances means that there is

a breakdown of the superdiﬀusive behavior. This is not recognized in both the astrophysical

spectral line formation as well as in the lab scale atomic vapors studies. This breakdown

means that the popular JW-type approximations of PFR under RII conditions are a severe

approximation, since they assume that core radiation CFR allows a single scattering to pho-

tons well into the absorption wings. Under experimental conditions rendering RII realistic, a

generalized diﬀusion equation should be valid even for core line radiation. This has a classical

analog found in physical kinetics, where the macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior is derived

from a microscopic description through a Chapman-Enskog expansion [1].

The RII and RIII redistribution functions assume either a complete frequency coherence or

a complete redistribution in the ARF, respectively. These situations should correspond to two

limiting cases for which the collisions during the excited state lifetime are almost nonexistent

or very frequent. For resonance lines, the general form of the redistribution function should

be [31, 33, 34]

where the branching ratio Pc = Γc

is deﬁned as the probability that an elastic collision

will destroy the correlation between the absorbed and the reemitted frequencies in the ARF

and should go to one in the limit of high densities and to zero in the low density limit. This

equation reﬂects the competition between complete redistribution in the ARF on the one

hand and almost complete coherence on the other hand, depending on the elastic collisional

rate. Presumably, below some critical value for Pc, RII -type redistribution will dictate a large

scale diﬀusive behavior while after that critical value, RIII will take control of the large scale

behavior giving rise to superdiﬀusion. The transition condensed in Eq. (40) is important since

26

the classical landmark work of Post in the 1980s for trapping under PFR with 185 nm Hg

radiation [31] corresponds to a range of Pc values roughly from 1% to 30%.

Figs. 4 to 9 display the conditional ODFs and jump size distributions for a given previ-

ous absorption optical frequency. The radiation migration in physical space is not a Markov

process whenever PFR is meaningful since the whole hierarchy of the process cannot be

constructed from the spatial distribution of the excitation in a given initial time plus the

single (spatial) transition probability (contrary to the CFR case where the spatial transition

probability is independent of past history). However, the spatial evolution of excitation can

be embedded in a Markov process deﬁned as the excitation migration in both spatial and

frequency space [4]. This extended Markov process will consider explicitly the joint redistri-

bution between absorption and reemission frequencies, information that otherwise would be

contained implicitly in the past values of the absorption frequencies. In principle, it would

even be possible to deﬁne two diﬀerent Markov processes for the all the Rs redistribution

mechanisms, depending on the coarsening level of the description [4]. On a ﬁne level descrip-

tion, one should have a complete stochastic formulation of the radiation trapping problem

encompassing both the small scale (controlled by PFR) as well as the large scale (asymptotic)

behaviors. But one could also devise a coarser level description retaining only the large scale

asymptotic and blurring the small scale PFR details into a transition probability valid only

for large distances. For the RI and RIII cases, the large scale transition probability would

be given by the corresponding Doppler or Lorentz CFR superdiﬀusive asymptotic while for

the RII a simpler diﬀusion-type behavior should apply.

Finally we discuss the applicability of the Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) formalism

to astrophysical applications.

In astrophysics, we have to deal with a very large number

of spectral lines that overlap. Typically, consideration of all the lines (plus continua) in

reaction-hydrodynamic modelling is prohibitive, but this can be circumvented by the use of

an ODF. Detailed studies of this approach have shown that ODFs reproduce satisfactorily

both emergent ﬂuxes and the physical stellar atmospheric structure [26].

In astrophysical

radiative transfer problems, each individual opacity will be the result of grouping several

lines. Recently, Wehrse and coworkers have used a Poisson distributed point process for

the statistical description of the number of lines [35]. However, they did not attempt a

comprehensive investigation of the dependencies of the ODFs on the detailed line proﬁles.

27

The present work is a contribution towards the improvement of this approach by including

the eﬀect of the absorption and reemission proﬁles in a similar way used by us to study the

anomalous diﬀusion resulting from the redistribution along a single line proﬁle.

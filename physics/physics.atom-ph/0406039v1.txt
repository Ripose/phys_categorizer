We discuss how a three level system can be used to change the frequency dependent magnetic
permeability of an atomic gas to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from one. We derive the conditions for
such a scheme to be successful and brieﬂy discuss the resulting macroscopic electrodynamics. We
ﬁnd that it may be possible to obtain left handed electrodynamics for an atomic gas using three
atomic levels.

INTRODUCTION

Changing the propagation properties of light by de-
signing a novel material is of interest both from a ba-
sic science point of view, and for technological applica-
tions. Recent advances such as slowing down[1] or stop-
ping light[2], or left handed metamaterials [3] promise
advances in ﬁelds ranging from optics [4] to quantum
computation[5]. It is desirable to ﬁnd new materials in
which electromagnetic waves exhibit novel behavior, and
there is a ﬂurry of activity both theoretically and exper-
imentally in this direction.

The macroscopic electromagnetic (EM) properties of
a medium are characterized by the frequency dependent
dielectric constant[6]

and the magnetic permeability

~D = ε(ω) ~E

~B = µ(ω) ~H.

v =

c

µ(ω)ε(ω)

Speed of an EM wave of frequency ω in this medium

is given by

(1)

(2)

(3)

p

where c is the speed of light in vacuum. The index of
refraction is then n =

p
µ(ω)ε(ω).
The dielectric constant of the medium shows large vari-
ations near a resonance, i.e. when the frequency of the
external ﬁeld is near an internal state transition. This
makes it easy to change the refractive index of a medium
by properly tuning the frequency of the EM wave to just
above or below a transition. Recently this fact was em-
ployed combined with quantum coherent eﬀects to get
very high refractive indices in atomic gases [1, 7].

Although ε(ω) can change appreciably for a gas of
atoms at optical frequencies, the magnetic permeability
µ(ω) is always very close to its free space value. One
can give arguments in classical electrodynamics to ex-
plain this [8], or understand it in terms of atomic tran-
sitions as follows. Magnetic ﬁeld component of an EM
wave couples to the atom much weaker than the electric
ﬁeld component. The magnetic coupling to an atom is
proportional to the Bohr magneton µB = e¯h
2mec = αea0,
while the electric coupling is ea0. The ﬁne structure con-
stant α
1/137 also shows itself in the induced magnetic
dipole moment. Overall the eﬀect of an EM wave on mag-
netic permeability is α2 weaker than its eﬀect on the elec-
tric susceptibility. Another important fact is that mag-
netic dipole transitions are allowed only between states
which have the same radial wavefunction, and generally
two such states are not separated by optical frequencies
in energy.

Now that it is hard to get µ(ω) to be diﬀerent than
one, we need to question why it is important to have
another value for it. After all it seems from Eq.(3)
that all the optical properties of the medium depend
on the product µ(ω)ε(ω). The answer to this question
is that the refractive index alone does not completely
represent the medium [9]. One can imagine two media,
ǫ1(ω),
one with ε1(ω) > 0, µ1(ω) > 0 and ǫ2(ω) =
µ2(ω) =
µ1(ω). They would have the same refrac-
tion index, however, quite diﬀerent optical properties.
Materials with both ε < 0 and µ < 0, are called left
handed materials, named for parity of the coordinate
frame formed by
. Optical properties of left
}
handed and right handed materials diﬀer mainly because,
the Poynting vector points opposite to ~k in left handed
materials. Most remarkable change happens at the inter-
face between a left handed material and a right handed
material, where the usual Snell’s refraction law gets a
sign change. In addition to the inverse Snell’s law, the
reverse Cerenkov radiation and the reverse Doppler shift
would also be possible in such materials[9].

Left handed artiﬁcial materials in the microwave re-
gion have recently been built[10] by assembling a com-
posite lattice of metallic split ring resonators and metallic

wires[11], with periodicity much smaller than the wave-
length of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, or using anomalous
propagation properties of light in a photonic crystal,
with periodicity is in the order of the wavelength of the
electromagnetic radiation[12]. All such systems (called
metamaterials), require delicate manufacturing of spa-
tially periodic structures. In the microwave region, im-
provements of focusing, ﬁltering and steering properties
of microwaves would be useful for many practical appli-
cations. Similar improvements would also be valuable for
applications operating at optical frequencies. In this pa-
per we examine the case of an atomic gas without any
spatial periodicity that could exhibit behavior similar to
metamaterials at optical frequencies.

We have remarked that the magnetic dipole response
to an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld is smaller by a factor of α2
compared to the electric dipole response to an oscillating
magnetic ﬁeld. In an EM wave ~E and ~B ﬁelds are always
perpendicular to each other and are always in phase. If
one can get the atom to respond to an electric ﬁeld ~E
with a magnetic moment ~µ perpendicular to it, and in
phase with it, one can eﬀectively think that the magnetic
dipole moment is induced by the magnetic ﬁeld of the
EM wave. Thus, it is possible get a magnetic response
which is only α times smaller than the electric response.
Such response enables one to achieve a regime where the
propagation properties of light are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
The aim of this paper is to explore the feasibility of this
idea to modify the magnetic permeability of an atomic
gas electromagnetically. To this end, we introduce a
model system in the next section and ﬁnd the neces-
sary conditions for the applicability of our scheme.
In
section III we present the results of our calculations for
two diﬀerent parameter regimes, a dilute gas and a dense
gas. We then go on to discuss the consequences of our
results for experiments. Finally, we give a summary of
our results and conclusions in section IV.

II. MODEL SYSTEM

In this section, we construct a model system for which
the magnetic permeability can be optically modiﬁed. We
also describe the scheme for modiﬁcation in detail, and
discuss its limitations.

One can readily conclude by parity arguments that it
is not possible to get a magnetic response to an electric
ﬁeld if only two states are involved. An electric ﬁeld
causes transitions to states which are of opposite parity
to ground state, and such states do not have a magnetic
dipole matrix element with the ground state. To over-
come this diﬃculty, we use a three level scheme, similar to
the one used in electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) [7, 13] where an optically thick substance is made
transparent and exhibits large dispersive response to the
external ﬁeld close to atomic resonance.

persive and exhibiting resonance phenomena. EIT ma-
terials do not suﬀer from linear absorption at resonance.
They exhibit small transmission losses even at high densi-
ties. As a consequence of the resonance, the EIT medium
stores large amount of energy over the cycles of interac-
tion, leading to strong material response.
In order to
have a negative electric and magnetic material response,
we need both the macroscopic polarization and magneti-
zation of the material become simultaneously so strong
that they would be immune even the sign changes of the
applied ﬁelds. For the weak probe beam, EIT cannot
achieve this feat single-handedly. By considering a dense
medium, with many particles within a cubic resonance
wavelength, we let the local ﬁelds in the substance help
to enhance the material responses. Indeed, we see that,
circularly polarized probe electric ﬁeld, under EIT condi-
tions, together with the help of the Lorentz-Lorenz local
ﬁeld contribution, could maintain strong local currents
that could give rise to large enough magnetization, in-
sensitive to sign changes of the probe magnetic ﬁeld. At
the same time, the electric response also becomes neg-
ative. The remainder of the section presents the math-
ematics behind these ideas as well as the conditions of
their applicability.

We require the three states to have the following non-

zero matrix elements :

where the ﬁrst two terms are the magnetic moments due
to the electronic orbital angular momentum L and spin
angular momentum S, while the last term is the contri-
bution of nuclear spin angular momentum I. The co-
eﬃcients are gL = 1 and gS = 2 (within a small 0.1%
correction found by quantum electrodynamical calcula-
tions). Nucleon magneton is about 1800 times smaller
than the Bohr magneton. Typical nuclear magnetic mo-
ments are about 1000 times smaller than their electronic
counterparts and hence usually negligible. If the Hamil-
tonian is parity invariant, we can choose all the states to
be eigenstates of the parity operator

we will take into account Lorentz-Lorenz correction after
determining the dilute material response as usual[15].

Setting aside the static ﬁeld solution we consider the case
of ν2 = 2ν1. The other possibility ν2 = 0 would be the
case of a static electric ﬁeld as the coupling ﬁeld. This
should be separately discussed as it is necessary to ex-
amine Stark shifts of the levels and modify the present
theory accordingly. The driving ﬁeld is taken to be res-
onant with the ω32 when the probe is resonant with the

ω31 so that δ = 2∆ which puts a constraint on the three
level system as ω32 = 2ω31.

This constraint is, however, a major obstacle in realiz-
ing the predicted eﬀects here at a realistic experimental
setting as it is not straightforward to ﬁnd a system with
two states, which have a matrix element of ~µ between
them and at the same time have energy diﬀerence in the
optical range. This is mainly due to the fact that µ is an
angular operator and the two states involved should have
the same radial wavefunctions to give a non zero matrix
element. One can imagine, some external magnetic ﬁeld
adjusting the separations to give the necessary energy
conditions. However, for an atomic system to get split-
tings in the optical regime, the external ﬁeld would be
impractically large. One can try to investigate systems
in which ~µ is not an angular operator, such as molecular
gases, and try to ﬁnd optically separated states which
have a magnetic dipole matrix element between them.

As far as atomic gases are concerned, the best option
seems to be to take two states which have the same L
value but which are split due to L-S coupling to be the
states
and try to get a third level of opposite
parity to fulﬁll the energy condition. Another direction
to proceed would be to consider all our discussion for an
atomic system under high electric ﬁeld. In that case, it
will not be too hard to get to ﬁelds which give shifts on
the order of optical frequencies, however one must care-
fully do the preceding analysis again taking into account
the eﬀect of static electric ﬁeld on all three states.

We assume this condition is fulﬁlled with our hypo-
thetical model atom and proceed by writing the prod-
uct Ω1~µ12 explicitly, so that we can examine the direc-
tional character of the magnetic response of the atom to
the probe ﬁeld. Electric dipole of the probe transition
and the magnetic dipole of the lower levels are combined
through a tensor product relation such that

With this deﬁnition of γ(ω) we can extend our result
to macroscopic electromagnetics of a gas with concentra-

We shall see that combined eﬀect of electric and magnetic
ﬁeld components of the optical ﬁelds, as well as local
ﬁeld eﬀects lead to novel light propagation regimes in
particular on the EIT resonance frequency.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We consider a gas of 23Na atoms with N = 1024m−3
to examine the case of dense media where the Lorentz-
Lorenz local ﬁeld corrections play signiﬁcant role and
N = 1012m−3, for the case of a dilute gas where the
local ﬁeld eﬀects are weak. Our results are presented in
Fig.2 for the dense media and in Fig.3 for the dilute gas.
We see that both the relative dielectric permittivity
ǫr = ǫ/ǫ0 and the relative magnetic permeability µr =
µ/µ0 can become negative over a band of frequency
∼
0.001γ. This allows the propagation of light through oth-
erwise opaque medium at high densities where the elec-
tromagnetically induced transparency would not work.

At resonance we ﬁnd µr(0) =
1.86 + i0.12. It is natural to have transmission losses
−
in our model, similar to other left-handed structures, as
they are unavoidable due to the Kramers-Kronig rela-
tions ensuring the causality in the system. On the other
hand, theoretically it is not a trivial task to estimate the
amount of losses[16, 17, 18] and to rigorously prove the
causality in left-handed materials[19, 20]. We can give
a simple and rough estimate by simply taking into ac-
count the imaginary part of the refractive index which
gives that after several microns the optical ﬁeld will be
damped by
33% due to linear absorption. At such
length scales, our atomic system with the given densities

may be found in Bose-Einstein condensed state due to
the interatomic interactions. Multiple scattering of pho-
tons as well as higher order many body correlations may
contribute in addition to the local ﬁeld correction. Such
eﬀects are argued to be about the same order with the
local ﬁeld correction [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. It is an
intriguing possibility that the present result of induced
left-handedness could improve and beneﬁt from contri-
butions arising from the quantum correlations in a dense
Bose-Einstein condensate or in a dense degenerate Fermi
gas. In this paper, we will be content with limiting our-
selves to classical gaseous media and hope to discuss the
case of quantum gases elsewhere in detail.

In the dilute gas limit, we recover the usual behavior
of the electric susceptibility under electromagnetically in-
duced transparency conditions. The transparency region
is in the valley between the twin peaks in the imaginary
part of the electric susceptibility where the peaks cor-
respond to the two dressed absorption lines, the Autler-
Townes doublet[28]. The magnetic susceptibility exhibits
steep variation over a narrow band of frequencies in the
vicinity of the resonance while in magnitude the rela-
tive permeability remains close to unity for all ∆. When
1020, similar results to those shown in Fig.3 are

found where now µr varies between 1.002 and 0.9985 over

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we suggested a method for optical mod-
iﬁcation of magnetic permeability using a three level
scheme and derived the necessary conditions for its ap-
plicability. We found that it is in principle possible
to electromagnetically induce left-handedness to a spa-
tially homogeneous media. The major challenge we face
is to have two levels separated at optical frequencies
while having a non-vanishing magnetic dipole matrix el-
ement. Such level splittings require large external mag-
netic ﬁelds or should be engineered by other means such
as external electric ﬁelds or spin-orbital couplings. One
may also consider molecular gases, or try to utilize ex-
citonic energy levels in solid state heterostructures to
engineer three level system fulﬁlling the energy condi-
tion. The predicted eﬀect is fundamentally based upon
the Lorentz-Lorenz local ﬁeld contribution in an elec-
tromagnetically induced transparency medium of three
level atoms with a non-vanishing dipole moment between
lower levels. In dense medium limit, in which the medium
becomes opaque normally with a negative dielectric con-

7

stant, the presence of magnetic dipole gives rise to a nega-
tive magnetic permeability so that the probe beam would
still propagate within the otherwise optically thick dense
medium for several microns before it is ﬁnally absorbed.
It should be emphasized that the presented method
is applicable to spatially homogeneous media and does
not need any spatial periodicity which is unavoidable in
metamaterials.
In the dilute medium limit, the value
of permeability do not change from unity appreciably,
however, in this case we observed that it demonstrates
steep changes over a small band of frequency. Such large
gradient of permeability may aﬀect the character of light
propagation such as its group velocity and may serve an
additional method to slow down or speed up the light.

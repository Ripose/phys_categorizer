We discuss the design and performance of a laser-pumped cesium vapor magnetometer in the
Mx-conﬁguration. The device will be implemented for the control and stabilization of ﬂuctuating
magnetic ﬁelds and gradients in a new experiment searching for a permanent electric dipole moment
of the neutron. We have determined the intrinsic sensitivity of the device to be 21 fT with a 1 s
integration time, limited by low frequency noise of the laser power.
In the shot noise limit the
magnetometer can reach a sensitivity of 7 fT with a 1 s integration time. We have used the device
to study the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in a three layer mu-metal shield for integration times in the
range of 2-100 seconds. The lowest values of the ﬂuctuations are traced back to the stability of the
power supply used to generate the ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In many areas of fundamental and applied science the
sensitive detection of weak magnetic ﬁelds and small ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations is of great importance. In the applied sec-
tor this concerns, for instance, non-destructive testing of
materials [1], geomagnetic and archaeological prospect-
ing [2], and the expanding ﬁeld of biomagnetism [3]. In
the realm of fundamental physics, strong demands on
magnetometric sensitivity are placed by modern experi-
ments looking for small violations of discrete symmetries
in atoms and elementary particles. For instance, many
experiments searching for time-reversal or parity viola-
tion rely on the precise monitoring and control of mag-
netic ﬁelds, with the sensitivity of the overall experiment
directly related to the ultimate sensitivity and stability of
the magnetic ﬁeld detection. Picotesla or even femtotesla
sensitivity requirements for averaging times of seconds to
minutes are common in that ﬁeld.

Our particular interest in this respect lies in the search
for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the
neutron. Such a moment violates both time reversal in-
variance and parity conservation. A ﬁnite sized EDM
would seriously restrict theoretical models that extend
beyond the standard model of particle physics [4]. Re-
cently our team has joined a collaboration aiming at a
new measurement of the permanent EDM of ultra-cold
neutrons (UCN) to be produced from the UCN source
under construction at Paul-Scherrer-Institute in Switzer-
land [5]. A neutron EDM spectrometer will be used,
in which the neutron spin-ﬂip frequency will be mea-
sured by a Ramsey resonance method in UCN storage
chambers exposed to a homogenous magnetic ﬁeld. Each
neutron chamber has two compartments in which the
neutrons are exposed to a static electric ﬁeld oriented
parallel/antiparallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. The signa-
ture of a ﬁnite EDM will be a change of the neutron

Larmor frequency that is synchronous with the reversal
of the relative orientations of the magnetic and electric
ﬁelds. Magnetic ﬁeld instabilities and inhomogeneities
may mimic the existence of a ﬁnite neutron EDM. The
control of such systematic eﬀects is therefore a crucial fea-
ture of the EDM experiment. It is planned to use a set of
optically pumped cesium vapor magnetometers (OPM),
operated in the Mx conﬁguration [6, 7] to perform that
control.

Although OPMs pumped by spectral discharge lamps
are suited for the task, we have opted for a system of laser
pumped OPMs (LsOPM). It was shown previously that
the replacement of the lamp in an OPM by a resonant
laser can lead to an appreciable gain in magnetometric
sensitivity [7, 8]. Laser pumping further oﬀers the ad-
vantage that a single light source can be used for the
simultaneous operation of several dozens of magnetome-
ter heads.
In that spirit we have designed and tested
a LsOPM with a geometry compatible with the neu-
tron EDM experiment.
In this report we present the
design and the performance of the Cs-LsOPM operated
in a phase-stabilized mode and discuss a systematic eﬀect
speciﬁcally related to laser pumping.

II. THE OPTICALLY-PUMPED Mx
MAGNETOMETER

Optically pumped magnetometers can reach extreme
sensitivities of a few fT/√Hz [7], comparable to stan-
dard SQUID (superconducting quantum interference de-
vice) detectors. Recently a low ﬁeld OPM with a sub-fT
resolution was demonstrated [9]. The use of OPMs for
the detection of biomagnetic signals was recently demon-
strated by our group [10, 11].

As a general rule the optimum choice of the OPM
depends on the speciﬁc demands (sensitivity, accuracy,
stability, bandwidth, spatial resolution, dynamic range,
etc.) of the magnetometric problem under considera-
tion. In our particular case the main requirements are
a highest possible sensitivity and stability for averaging

times ranging from seconds up to 1000 seconds in a 2 µT
ﬁeld together with geometrical constraints imposed by
the neutron EDM experiment.

tude X, the quadrature amplitude Y and the phase φ of
the photocurrent with respect to the oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld are given by

Optically pumped alkali vapor magnetometers rely on
an optical-radio frequency (r.f.) resonance technique and
are described, e.g., in [6]. When an alkali vapor is irra-
diated with circularly polarized light resonant with the
D1 absorption line (transition from the nS1/2 ground
state to the ﬁrst nP1/2 excited state), the sample is opti-
cally pumped and becomes spin polarized (magnetized)
along the direction of the pumping light. While lamp
pumped OPM pump simultaneously all hyperﬁne tran-
sitions of the D1 line, the use of a monomode laser in
a LsOPM allows one to resolve the individual hyperﬁne
transitions provided that their Doppler width does not
exceed the hyperﬁne splitting in both the excited and
ground states. This is, for example, the case for the D1
transition of the alkali isotopes 133Cs and 87Rb. In that
case it is advantageous to set the laser frequency to the
1/2 transition, which allows
F = I + 1/2
one to optically pump the atoms into the two (non ab-
using σ+
sorbing) dark states
polarized radiation. A magnetic ﬁeld B1(t) oscillating
at the frequency ωrf , which is resonant with the Zeeman
splitting of the states, drives population out of the dark
states into absorbing states, so that the magnetic reso-
nance transition can be detected via a change of the op-
tical transmission of the vapor. That is the very essence
of optically detected magnetic resonance.

In the so-called Mx or 45◦ conﬁguration the static mag-
netic ﬁeld B0 to be measured is oriented at 45◦ with re-
spect to the laser beam, while the oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld B1(t) is at right angles with respect to B0 (Fig. 1).
In classical terms, the Larmor precession of the magne-
tization around B0 (at the frequency ωL) is driven by
the co-rotating component of the B1(t)-ﬁeld, which im-
poses a phase on the precessing spins. The projection of
the precessing polarization onto the propagation direc-
tion of the light beam then leads to an oscillating mag-
netization component along that axis, and therefore to
a periodic modulation of the optical absorption coeﬃ-
cient. The system behaves like a classical oscillator, in
which the amplitude and the phase of the response (cur-
rent from a photodiode detecting the transmitted laser
intensity) depend in a resonant way on the frequency of
the B1 ﬁeld. From the resonance condition ωL = ωrf the
Larmor frequency and hence the magnetic ﬁeld can be
inferred.

When the AC component of the detected optical signal
is transmitted to the coils producing the B1(t) ﬁeld with
a 90◦ phase shift and an appropriate gain, the system will
spontaneously oscillate at the resonance frequency.
In
that self-oscillating conﬁguration the OPM can in princi-
ple follow changes of the magnetic ﬁeld instantaneously
with a bandwidth limited by the Larmor frequency only
[6].

Here we have used an alternative mode of operation,
the so-called phase-stabilized mode. The in-phase ampli-

where x = (νL −
ized to the (light-power dependent) half width at half
maximum ∆νHWHM of the resonance. S is a saturation
parameter which describes the r.f. power broadening of
the line. It is interesting to note that the width of the
phase dependence, which is determined by the ratio of
the X(x) and Y (x) signals, is independent of S, and
hence immune to r.f. power broadening. The phase φ(x)

has a linear dependence on the detuning νL −
detected by a phase sensitive ampliﬁer (lock-in detector)
whose phase output drives a voltage-controlled oscillator
(VCO) which feeds the r.f. coils. The VCO signal, phase
shifted by 90◦, serves as a reference to the phase detector.
This feedback loop thus actively locks the r.f. frequency
to the Larmor frequency and the magnetometer tracks
magnetic ﬁeld changes in a phase coherent manner. That
mode of operation is a modiﬁcation of the self-oscillating
magnetometer in the sense that the lock-in ampliﬁer, the
loop ﬁlter (PID), and the VCO are the components of
a tracking ﬁlter which shifts the detected signal by 90◦
and applies the ﬁltered signal to the r.f. coils. The dif-
ferences to the self-oscillating scheme are the following:
the bandwidth of the phase-stabilized magnetometer is
determined by the feedback loop transmission function,
and the phase shift is always 90◦ independent of the Lar-
mor frequency, while in the self-oscillating scheme the
phase-shifter has a frequency dependence and is 90◦ only
for a single Larmor frequency. Note that the tracking
ﬁlter in a strict sense is not a phase-locked loop (PLL),
since there is only one detectable frequency in the sys-
tem, i.e., νrf . A detuning between the r.f.
frequency
and the Larmor frequency produces a static phase shift,
while in a real PLL the detuning between the reference
frequency and the frequency which is locked produces a
time dependent phase shift.

III. MAGNETOMETER HARDWARE

The LsOPM for the n-EDM experiment consists of two
parts: a sensor head containing no metallic parts except
the r.f. coils, and a base station mounted in a portable
19” rack drawer, which contains the frequency stabilized
laser and the photodetector. The laser light is carried
from the base station to the sensor head by a 10 m long
multimode ﬁber with a core diameter of 800 µm. The

light transmitted through the cell is carried back to the
detection unit by a similar ﬁber. The sensor head is de-
signed to ﬁt into a tube of 104 mm diameter, coaxial with
the 2 µT ﬁeld, and has a total length of 242 mm. The
main component of the sensor is an evacuated glass cell
with a diameter of 7 cm containing a droplet of cesium
in a sidearm connected to the main volume. A constric-
tion in the sidearm minimizes the collision rate of vapor
atoms with the cesium metal. The probability of spin
depolarization due to wall collisions with the inner sur-
face of the glass cell is strongly reduced by a thin layer
of paraﬃn coating the cell walls [12]. A pair of circular
coils (70 mm diameter separated by 52 mm) encloses the
cell and produces the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld B1(t).

The light driving the magnetometer is produced by
a tunable extended-cavity diode laser in Littman con-
ﬁguration (Sacher Lasertechnik GmbH, model TEC500).
The laser frequency is actively locked to the 4-3 hyper-
ﬁne component of the Cs D1 transition (λ = 894 nm) in
an auxiliary cesium vapor cell by means of the dichroic
atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) technique [13]. The
stabilization to a Doppler-broadened resonance provides
a continuous stable operation over several weeks and
makes the setup rather insensitive to mechanical shocks.
At the sensor head the light from the ﬁber is colli-
mated by a f = 15 mm lens and its polarization is made
circular by a polarizing beamsplitter and a quarter-wave
plate placed before the cesium cell. The light transmitted
through the cell is focused into the return ﬁber, which
guides it to a photodiode. The photocurrent is ampli-
ﬁed by a low-noise transimpedance ampliﬁer. Placing
the laser, the electronics, and the photodiode far away

from the sensor head eliminates magnetic interference
generated by those components on the magnetometer (a
photocurrent of 10 µA, e.g., produces a magnetic ﬁeld of
200 pT at a distance of 1 cm). In the present setup the
oscillating-ﬁeld coil is fed via a twisted-pair conductor,
which represents an eﬀective antenna by which electro-
magnetic signals can be coupled into the magnetic shield.
In a future stage of development it is planned to replace
this electric lead by an opto-coupled system.

All studies reported below were performed inside a
cylindrical three-layer mu-metal shield (size of the inner-
most shield: length 600 mm, diameter 300 mm) that re-
duces the inﬂuence of ambient magnetic ﬁeld variations.
The longitudinal bias ﬁeld of 2 µT, corresponding to a
Cs Larmor frequency of 7 kHz, is produced by a solenoid
(length 600 mm, diameter 110 mm) inside the shield and
the 8 mA current is provided by a specially designed sta-
ble current supply.

A. Resonance linewidth

The lineshapes of the magnetic resonance line are mea-
sured with the magnetometer operating in the open-loop
mode (Fig. 1, mode B). A sinusoidally oscillating current
of frequency ωrf is supplied to the r.f. coils by a function
generator, whose frequency is ramped across the Larmor
frequency, and the output of the photodiode is demodu-
lated by a lock-in ampliﬁer. Magnetic resonance lines
were recorded for diﬀerent B1 amplitudes and diﬀerent
values of the pump light power. Typical resonance lines
are shown in Fig. 2. The lineshapes were ﬁtted by the
function (3) to the experimental φ(νrf ) curves, which al-
lows one to infer the linewidth ∆νHWHM. We recall that
the linewidth is not aﬀected by r.f. power broadening,
but that it is subject to broadening by the optical pump-
ing process. The dependence of ∆νHWHM on the laser
intensity (Fig. 3) shows that the optical broadening has
a non-linear dependence on the light intensity. The min-
imum or intrinsic linewidth is determined by extrapolat-
ing ∆νHWHM to zero light intensity.

For a J = 1/2 two-level system theory predicts a lin-
ear dependence of the linewidth on the pumping light
intensity, as long as stimulated emission processes from
the excited state can be neglected. However, the mag-
netic resonance spectrum in the F = 4 manifold of the
Cs ground state is a superposition of eight degenerate
resonances corresponding to all allowed ∆M =
1 tran-
sitions between adjacent Zeeman levels. The coupling of
the σ+ polarized light to the diﬀerent sublevels depends
on their magnetic quantum number MF and is given by
the corresponding electric dipole transition matrix ele-
ments. As a consequence each of the eight resonances
broadens at a diﬀerent rate. The observed linewidth
results from the superposition of those individual lines
weighted by the population diﬀerences of the levels cou-
pled by the r.f. transition and the corresponding mag-
netic dipole transition rates. The observed nonlinear de-

±

The intrinsic linewidth, i.e., the linewidth for vanish-
ing optical and r.f. power, is determined by relaxation
due to spin exchange Cs-Cs collisions, Cs-wall collisions,
and collisions of the atoms with the Cs droplet in the
reservoir sidearm. The latter contribution depends on
the ratio of the cross section of the constriction in the
sidearm and the inner surface of the spherical cell. With
an inner sidearm diameter of 0.5 mm that contribution to
the HWHM linewidth can be estimated to be on the or-
der of ∆ν = 1 Hz. The contribution from spin exchange
processes at room temperature to the linewidth can be
estimated using the cross-section reported in [14] to be
on the order of 3 Hz, which is larger than the measured
width. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the
adsorption of Cs atoms in the paraﬃn coating [12], which
may lead to an eﬀective vapor pressure in the cell below
its thermal equilibrium value.

pendence of the width on the light intensity follows from
the nonlinear way in which those population diﬀerences
and hence the relative weights are changed by the optical
pumping process.

magnetic ﬁelds were taken into account in the rotating
wave approximation. We further assumed an isotropic
relaxation of the spin coherence at a rate given by the
experimentally determined intrinsic linewidth of Fig. 3.
The solid curve in that ﬁgure represents the linewidths
inferred from the calculated lineshapes. The calculations
used as a variable an optical pumping rate (proportional
to the light power intensity) and the only parameter used
to ﬁt the calculation to the experimental data was the
proportionality constant between the laser intensity and
that pump rate.

The actual magnetometry is performed in the phase-
stabilized mode (Fig. 1, mode A) as described above. The
photodiode signal is demodulated by a lock-in ampliﬁer
(Stanford Research Systems, model SR830) locked to the
driving r.f. frequency, produced by a voltage-controlled
oscillator (VCO). The time constant of the lock-in am-
pliﬁer was set to τ = 30 µs, which corresponds to a band-
width of 2.6 kHz with a
24 dB/octave ﬁlter roll-oﬀ. Ei-
ther the phase (adjusted to be 0◦ on resonance) or the
dispersive in-phase signal of the lock-in ampliﬁer can be
used to control the VCO, and hence to lock its frequency
to the center of the magnetic resonance. Compared to the

lying curve is the contribution from laser power noise and Nint
its contribution at the Larmor frequency (inset). The straight
line indicates the shot noise limit NSN. The signal-to-noise
ratio S/Nint is approximately 33000. The sidebands are due
to imperfectly shielded magnetic ﬁeld components oscillating
at the 50-Hz. The signal-to-noise ratio S/Next due to external
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations is approximately 2600. All measurements
were done in a 1 Hz bandwidth.

in-phase signal the phase signal of the lock-in ampliﬁer
has the advantage that the resonance linewidth is not af-
fected by r.f. power broadening. However, the bandwidth
of the phase output of the digital lock-in ampliﬁer used
was limited to 200 Hz by its relatively slow update rate.
For the neutron EDM experiment the magnetometer has
to be operated with the highest possible bandwidth. We
therefore chose the in-phase signal for the following stud-
ies. That signal drives the VCO via a feedback ampliﬁer
(integrating and diﬀerentiating), which closes the feed-
back loop locking the radio frequency to the Larmor fre-
quency.

IV. PERFORMANCE OF THE
MAGNETOMETER

A. Magnetometric sensitivity

We characterize the sensitivity of the magnetometer
in terms of the noise equivalent magnetic ﬂux density
(NEM), which is the ﬂux density change δB equivalent
to the total noise of the detector signal

δB2 = δB2

with both internal and external contributions: δBint de-
scribes limitations due to noise sources inherent to the
magnetometer proper, while δBext represents magnetic
noise due to external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The larger of
the two contributions determines the smallest ﬂux den-
sity change that the magnetometer can detect. In general

the internal NEM δBint may have several contributions,
which may be expressed as

where τ is the integration time used for calculating the
Allan standard deviation introduced below. Figure 4
shows a typical Fourier spectrum of the OPM signal.
The prominent central feature corresponds to the Lar-
mor oscillation of the photocurrent at 7 kHz during the
phase-stabilized operation of the OPM. It is the signal-to-
noise ratio at the Larmor frequency, which determines the
NEM of the magnetometer. The Larmor peak (carrier)
is superposed on a 20 Hz broad pedestal, which itself lies
above a constant noise ﬂoor. The two discrete sidebands
originate from magnetic ﬁelds oscillating at the 50 Hz
line frequency. The pedestal results mainly from imper-
fectly shielded low-frequency ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The con-
tinuous spectrum of such ﬂuctuations is mixed with the
Larmor frequency and therefore appears as a symmetric
background underlying the carrier. We have ﬁtted the
pedestal with a Lorentzian lineshape, from which we in-
fer a signal-to-noise ratio S/Next = 2600 at the Larmor

frequency, in which Next corresponds to magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations δBext of 370 fT in a 1 Hz bandwidth.

A major contribution to the internal noise Nint comes
from laser power ﬂuctuations, whose spectrum produces
AM noise on the photocurrent. The mixing of that noise
with the Larmor frequency produces a symmetric back-
ground under the Larmor peak, which also contributes
to the pedestal discussed above. In order to distinguish
it from the δBext contributions we have measured the low
frequency noise spectrum of the laser power. It shows a
1/f -like behavior for small frequencies, which levels oﬀ
at the shot noise value. After mixing with the Larmor
frequency its contribution to the magnetometer noise is
shown as the lowest lying curve in Fig. 4. The central
portion of this spectrum is shown on an expanded scale
in the inset. The sidebands are probably due to mechani-
cal vibrations, while the central feature extends
1.5 Hz.
Nint represents the contribution of that power noise to
the magnetometer noise at the Larmor frequency. The
direct contribution to δB from light power noise is thus
negligible compared to the contributions from ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations and conﬁrms the assumption made above that
the latter dominate the pedestal. The signal-to-noise ra-
tio S/Nint is 33000 and yields a NEM δBint = 29 fT in a
1 Hz bandwidth determined by laser power ﬂuctuations.
Far away from the Larmor frequency the measured
constant noise ﬂoor exceeds the calculated shot noise
level (NSN) by a factor of 1.5. This may originate from
additional noise sources related, e.g., to the laser fre-
quency stabilization. The fundamental limit of the mag-
netometric sensitivity is determined by the white shot
noise NSN =
2eIpcfbw of the photocurrent Ipc, which
deﬁnes the ultimate shot noise limited NEM δBSN. Un-
der optimized conditions the photocurrent is 5 µA, which
yields a shot noise limited NEM of δBSN = 10 fT in a
bandwidth of 1 Hz.

Light shift ﬂuctuations are an additional source of
noise. Any ﬂuctuations of the parameters causing a light
shift (laser power and/or laser frequency detuning) will
produce magnetic ﬁeld equivalent noise. We will show
later that for a 1 Hz detection bandwidth this eﬀect gives
a negligible contribution to the Fourier spectrum.

As the internal noise level δBint is much smaller than
the external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations δBext the magnetometer is
well suited to measure the characteristics of such ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations (cf. Sec. IV C) and/or to compensate them
using an active feedback loop. The accuracy of such mea-
surements or the performance of such a stabilization is
ultimately limited by the internal noise of the magne-
tometer, which under ideal conditions can reach the shot
noise limit.

the signal-to-noise ratio. For given properties of the sen-
sor medium (cesium vapor pressure and cell size) these
two properties depend on the two main system param-
eters, viz., the laser intensity IL (or power PL) and the
amplitude B1 of the r.f. ﬁeld. For the application in
the neutron EDM experiment the sensor size and va-
por pressure are dictated by the experimental constraints
(ﬁxed geometry and operation at room temperature), so
that the experimental optimization of the magnetomet-
ric sensitivity is performed in the (IL, B1) space by an
iterative procedure. Fig. 5 shows examples of signal-
to-noise ratio recordings during such an iteration. The
optimum operating point was found for a laser inten-
sity IL of 9 µW/mm2 and a r.f. ﬁeld amplitude B1 of
2.7 nT. The resonance linewidth under optimal condi-
tions is ∆νHWHM = 3.4(1) Hz, which exceeds the intrinsic
linewidth by a factor of 2.4.

In order to investigate the dependence of the NEM
on the two optimization parameters we have calculated
that dependence using the density matrix formalism by

The bandwidth of the magnetometer, i.e., its temporal
response to ﬁeld changes was measured in the following
way: a sinusoidal modulation of the static magnetic ﬁeld
with an amplitude of 5 nT was applied by an additional
single wire loop (110 mm diameter) wound around the Cs
cell. The response of the magnetometer to that perturba-

C. Application: Field ﬂuctuations in a magnetic
shield

External ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are the dominant contribu-
tion to the noise of the LsOPM when it is operated in the
Fribourg 3-layer magnetic shield. We have used the mag-
netometer to study the temporal characteristics of the
residual ﬁeld variations. The Allan standard deviation
[15] is the most convenient measure for that characteri-
zation. With respect to the experimental speciﬁcations
of the neutron EDM experiment our particular interest
is the ﬁeld stability for integration times in the range of
100 to 1000 s. For that purpose we recorded the Larmor
frequency in multiple time series of several hours with
a sampling rate of 0.1 s by feeding the photodiode sig-
nal, ﬁltered by a resonant ampliﬁer (band-pass of 200 Hz
width centered at 7 kHz), to a frequency counter (Stan-
ford Research Systems, model SR620). From each time
series the Allan standard deviation of the ﬂux density in-
side the shield was calculated. A typical result is shown in
Fig. 8 with both absolute and relative scales. For integra-
tion times up to seconds the observed ﬂuctuations (curve
a) decrease as τ −1/2, indicating the presence of white

density of 413 fT/√Hz. Although the Allan standard de-
viation represents a diﬀerent property than the Fourier
noise spectrum it is worthwhile to note that the latter
value is comparable with the NEM δBext = 370 fT of the
pedestal in Fig. 4 discussed above. The ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
reach a minimal value of approximately 200 fT for an in-
tegration time of 4 s.

The central region of the Allan plot (Fig. 8. a) shows
a plateau for integration times of 2-100 seconds.
It is
probably due to ﬂuctuations of the 8 mA current produc-
ing the 2 µT bias ﬁeld. A magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation of
200 fT corresponds to a relative current stability of 10−7,
i.e., to current ﬂuctuations of 800 pA. In an auxiliary ex-
periment we measured the current ﬂuctuations ∆I by
recording voltage ﬂuctuations over a series resistor for
several hours. We found relative ﬂuctuations of ∆I/I in
the corresponding Allan plot of the same order of mag-
nitude as the ∆B/B ﬂuctuations. It is thus reasonable
to assume that the origin of the plateau in Fig. 8a is due
to current ﬂuctuations of the power supply.

The Allan standard deviations for integration times
exceeding 100 s are due to slow drifts of the laboratory
ﬁelds, which are not completely suppressed by the longi-
tudinal shielding factor of 103 of the three-layer shield.

D. Frequency noise due to light power ﬂuctuations

It is well-known that a near-resonant circularly polar-
ized light ﬁeld shifts the Zeeman levels in the same way
as a static magnetic ﬁeld oriented along the light beam.
The light shift has contributions from the AC Stark shift
and coherence shift due to virtual and real transitions
[16]. The AC Stark shift, and hence the equivalent mag-
netic ﬁeld BLS is proportional to the light intensity IL
and has a dispersive (Lorentzian) dependence on the de-
tuning of the laser frequency from the center of the op-
tical absorption line. It is therefore expected to vanish
at the (optical) line center. In our experiment the laser
frequency is locked to the center of a Doppler-broadened
hyperﬁne component. However, that frequency does not
coincide with the frequency for which the light shift van-
ishes, because of ﬁnite light shift contributions from the
adjacent hyperﬁne component. While the two hyperﬁne
components are well separated in the optical absorption
spectra, their corresponding light shift spectra overlap
because of the broad wings of their dispersive lineshapes.
In order to measure the light shift eﬀect we period-
ically changed the light power between P + ∆P/2 and
∆P/2 and recorded the corresponding Larmor fre-
P
quencies. False eﬀects from drifts of the external mag-
netic ﬁeld were suppressed by recording data over several
modulation periods. For each modulation amplitude ∆P
the Larmor frequency was measured with both σ+ and
σ− polarizations by rotating the quarter-wave plate by
means of a mechanical remote control from outside the
shield.

both polarizations are shown in Fig. 9. As anticipated,
the shift of the Larmor frequency is proportional to the
modulation amplitude of the light power and changes sign
upon reversing the light helicity. However, it can be seen
that the slope of the light shift depends on the helicity.
This asymmetry is the result of contributions from three
distinct eﬀects, which we discuss only qualitatively here.

(1) The light shift due to virtual transitions (AC Stark
shift), which is proportional to the helicity of the light
and thus leads to a symmetric contribution to the curves
of Fig. 9 (equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign); (2)
the light shift due to real transitions (coherence shift)[16],
whose origin is a change of the eﬀective g-factor of the
Cs atom due to the fact that with increasing laser power
the atom spends an increasing fraction of its time in the
excited state with a 3 times smaller gF -factor of opposite
sign than that of the ground state; (3) a possible power
dependent change of the capacity of the photodiode and
a subsequent power dependent phase shift of the pho-
tocurrent. The latter two eﬀects yield shifts which have
the same sign for both light polarizations, so that the
combined contribution of the three eﬀects may explain
the diﬀerent magnitudes of the slopes. A quantitative
study of those eﬀects is underway.

Using curve (a) as a worst-case estimate for the ﬂuctu-
ations of the Larmor frequency due to light power ﬂuc-
tuations we estimated, based on measured power ﬂuc-
tuations, the resulting magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The
results are shown as triangles in Fig. 8. Light shift ﬂuc-
tuations of the magnetometer readings are thus one to
two orders of magnitude smaller than residual ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations in the present shield. The light shift noise can
of course be further suppressed by adjusting the laser
frequency to the zero light shift frequency point or bet-
ter by actively stabilizing it to that point or by actively
stabilizing the laser power.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have described the design and performance of a
phase-stabilized cesium vapor magnetometer. The mag-
netometer has an intrinsic NEM of 21 fT, deﬁned as the
Allan standard deviation for an integration time of 1 sec-
ond. If the 1/f noise of the laser power can be lowered,
e.g., by an active power stabilization and the excess white
noise ﬂoor can be reduced to the shot noise level the
LsOPM should reach a NEM of 7 fT for a 1 s integration
time. The bandwidth of the phase-stabilized LsOPM is
1 kHz. We have used the LsOPM to measure ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations in a three-layer magnetic shield for integration
times between 0.1 and 1000 seconds, whose lowest val-
ues were found to be on the order of 200-300 fT. Light
shift ﬂuctuations, against which no particular precau-
tions were taken, are one to two orders of magnitude
smaller than the residual ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in the shield.

The LsOPM described here compares very favorably
with state-of-the-art lamp-pumped magnetometers. De-
tails on that comparison will be published elsewhere. It
will be a valuable tool for fundamental physics experi-
ments. The LsOPM presented above meets the require-
ments of the neutron-EDM experiment on the relevant
time scales in the range of 100 to 1000 seconds.

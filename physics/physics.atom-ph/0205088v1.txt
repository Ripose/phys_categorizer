Abstract

The photoion spectrum of atomic potassium was measured over the 3s → np
excitation region with the photoion time-of-ﬂight method and monochromatized
synchrotron radiation. An unusual spectrum with paired windows structure was
found instead of a simple regular Rydberg series. Such subsidiary windows have
not been observed in the 3s → np resonances of Ar, which has a closed outer
shell. Based on Dirac-Fock calculations, the dual window structure at 36.7 eV and
at 37.4 eV was assigned to the 3s−13p64s4p resonance. The line shape can be
ﬁtted by Fano’s formula and the Fano parameters were obtained.

1 Introduction

Autoionizing resonances of atoms, involving conﬁguration mixing of discrete excited states with
direct ionization continua, have been studied intensely1–21 since the ﬁrst measurement of the
double photoexcitation resonances of helium with synchrotron radiation. In particular, the sub-
valence s-shell photoexcitation in rare gas atoms 5–15 and closely related species 18–21 have been
noted for the window type resonances, appearing as dips in the continuum background of the

photo-absorption spectrum. Window resonances are extreme cases of the Beutler-Fano proﬁle
with proﬁle index q close to zero. Such window type resonance can be of particular interest
for resonances with very small oscillator-strengths since they may nevertheless appear conspicu-
ously in the spectrum through strong interactions with the continua; and, furthermore, the spec-
tral window depth are affected strongly by the phases of channel wavefunctions.

In the present work, we performed charge-state resolved photoion yield spectrscopy mea-
surements of the potassium 3s → np resonances with monochromatized synchrotron radiation
and photoion time of ﬂight (TOF) spectroscopy technique. Subsequently, multi-conﬁguration
Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations22 were performed in order to understand the structure of the
spectrum. It was found that the 3s13p64snp series appeared prominently as window resonances
in the direct 3p ionization continua.

2 Experiment and Results

The photoion yield spectra were measured at the 2.5 GeV electron storage ring of the Photon
Factory, KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. The BL-3B bending magnet beamline with a 24m spherical
grating monochromator (24-m SGM23, 24) was employed. A 200 l/mm laminar type grating was
used for this experiment with 100 µm symmetric slit setting which resulted in 50 meV resolu-
tion. Monochromatized synchrotron radiation of 35 - 45 eV irradiated atomic potassium which
were created by a resistive heating metal vapor oven and led into the collision chamber from
the bottom. The background pressure in the experimental chamber was kept below 1.0×10−7
Torr. The photoions were detected by a time of ﬂight (TOF) mass spectrometer25 mounted per-
pendicular to both the atomic and photon beams, operating in a pulsed extraction mode. The
charge-state resolved photoion yield spectra of K+ and K2+ were measured by gated collection
of the photoion TOF data obtained in each step of the photon energy scan. The photoion counts
were normalized by the photon ﬂux of the synchrotron radiation monitored with the drain current
from the post-focusing mirror. The photon energy calibration was accomplished by measuring
the spectra of some rare gases.10, 12

The relevant part of the charge-state resolved photoion yield spectrum is shown in Fig.1.
The singly charged K+ yield spectrum appears very similar to the total absorption spectrum
since the K2+ yield is very small in the photon energy region of interest. Some window type
features attributed to K 3s → np excitations are found in the K+ yield spectrum. However, their
appearance is in contrast to the Ar 3s → np spectrum, which shows a very sharp and regular
Rydberg series11 up to high n. The potassium resonances are broader with a less clear Rydberg
series structure, disappearing at lower n. This is true not only for neutral potassium atoms but
also for potassium ions as observed previously.18–21 Since K+ is isoelectronic to Ar, it can be
inferred that the presence of a valence 4s electron does not play a decisive role in this difference.
However, the most striking feature of the K+ yield spectrum is a paired windows structure, with
the deepest and lowest feature at 36.7 eV and a smaller one right next to it at 37.4 eV, clearly too
close to be the next member of the Rydberg series. Since neither the K+ nor the Ar 3s → 4p
resonances exhibit any subsidiary dip next to the main window resonance, this can be interpreted
as due to the presence of the 4s electron.

The resonances in the K+ yield spectrum were ﬁtted with a Fano proﬁle for an isolated
discrete state interacting with a single continuum,1, 2 convoluted with the 50 meV bandpass of
the monochromator. The results are shown in Table 1. The photoion yield, σ(E), is given by

σa is the depth of the minimum associated with the resonance, and represents the portion of the
continua that interacts with the discrete state. σb is the portion of the continua that does not
interact with the discrete state. The proﬁle index q gives the shape of the resonance. When q is
smaller than 1, the resonances form a dip like structure, i.e. a window resonance.

3 Calculations and Results

A series of MCDF calculations were performed by the programs GRASP9222 and RATIP.26 We
used also an older version of GRASP code (GRASP2) for the non-relativistic symmetry indices
such as the total spin S and the total orbital angular momentum L, which are useful to refer the
conﬁguration state functions expressed in terms of non-relativistic scheme of conventions. The
total electronic energies of the K ground state, two series of 3s → np excited states that could
be assigned as either quartet P or doublet P in the non-relativistic sense were calculated. And
the potassium ionic states with a 3s or 3p hole were also calculated. Differences in the energy
of the ground state and the excited state energies correspond to the resonance energies. Also, the
oscillator strengths of 3s → np excitations as well as the Auger rate of 3s → np excited states
were obtained. Relevant results of the calculations are shown in Table 2; we found two series
of photo-excitations that are comparable with the present experiment. Although the total spin

The term purity in LS-coupling for these states is approximately 93 % based on the our
calculation results; i. e., the major contributions are from the quartet for the lower series in Table
2 and from the doublet for the higher series in Table 2. And further on, this means that 7 % of
the conﬁguration state component is of doublet in the lower series, and, consequently, that, in
this series, the photo-excitation from the ground states is realized though this minor component.
We would call, in the Table 2, the lower series as quartet and the higher series as doublet, here
after, for the sake of convenience. The calculated oscillator strengths are quite small in both
doublet and quartet 3s → 4p resonances; we obtained 2.1 × 10−2 for 2P1/2 and 2.5 × 10−5 for
4P1/2 (see also Table 2). Due to these very small oscillator strengths, the 4P and 2P resonances
in the photoionization spectra may appear as windows with the reduction of photoabsorption
over the resonance positions. However, the window depths are not of the direct concern to the
values of the oscillator strengths; the depths are inﬂuenced strongly by the phases of ionization
channels. Nevertheless, the larger q value for the 2P than for the 4P may reﬂect the small yet
greater oscillator strength of the doublet.

Signiﬁcant 3s23p43d14snp conﬁguration mixing with the 3s-hole states 3s13p64snp were
found. The magnitude of mixing reaches almost 25 % of the total occupation, causing the total
state-energy to decrease by almost 6.47 eV. Also, a signiﬁcant contribution from the 3d 2 con-
ﬁgurations were obtained by incorporating the d-orbitals up to 4d in the MCDF wave function
expansions. The 3p or 4s ionization energies can be used as benchmarks to assess the accuracy

of the present calculation scheme. We have calculated the total energies of K+ 3s23p54s 3,1P o,
K+ 3s23p6, and K2+ 3s23p5 from which the ionization threshold energies with regard to the K
ground state are obtained. As seen from Table 3, the results are in good agreement with previous
data27, 28 and support the reliability of the present calculation.

4 Discussion

Based on our calculated photon energy positions, the deeper window can be assigned as due to
the 3s13p64s4p and most of the series of windows above the lowest dual windows structure can
be attributed to 3s13p64snp resonances. The ﬁrst excitation state cause the lowest dual window.
Comparing the observations with the calculations, the dual window may be attributed to the
resonances 3s → 4p 4P and 2P . The energy difference of 0.7 eV for the neighbored windows is
important for this assignment. Furthermore, the resonance width calculated by RATIP is close
to the observation (See Table1). The calculation predicted another 3s13p64s4p doublet state
by 2.38 eV above the deepest window, which was invisible in the present experimental spectra.
This doublet P state and another doublet P state which corresponds to the ﬁrst entry of the
”higher series” form a pair of doublet states with the same conﬁguration 3s13p64s4p. The
energy difference of these doublet P states 2 eV is considered as mainly from the term splitting
between 4s4p singlet and triplet energies.

The main decay channel from the 3s → np excited states is the following:

3s13p64snp −→ 3s23p54s + e−
in this photon energy region according to our Auger rate calculations using RATIP.26 On the
other hand, for the continuum contributions, the predominant channel is the 3p direct ionization:
3s23p64s + hν −→ 3s23p54s + e−
Since the ﬁnal state in the predominant decay channel and the predominant direct ionization
channel have the same conﬁguration, they may interfere and mix strongly if their symmetries
match. Therefore both the quartet and doublet terms in the intermediate K 3s13p64snp state
conﬁgurations require components in the continua that satisfy the symmetry condition, in order
to form autoionizing resonances. Since the ﬁnal ionic states have open shells and have two
possible j for a 3p electron, j = 1/2 and 3/2, the LS term of ﬁnal state cannot be decided
uniquely.

Two thresholds of 3s direct ionization are clearly observed in the K2+ yield spectrum at
40.28 eV (3s13p64s 3S) and at 40.67 eV (3s13p64s 1S). The energy positions are in good
agreement with the calculations (See Table2). These correspond to the series limit 3s → np,
3s13p64snp 4P and 3s13p64snp 2P . The limits did not appear in the K+ spectrum. There is no
clear feature at the double ionization threshold 35.971 eV27, 28 in the K2+ spectrum. Below the 3s
direct ionization threshold, a peak-like Rydberg series was found. This series may be attributed
to the doublet term of 3s → np (n ≥ 5) excitation. Even though direct double photoionization

5

is energetically possible above 35.971 eV,27, 28 it is very weak compared to the single ionization
process in this energy region. Hence, the 2P series, with a much larger oscillator strength, appear
as a peak like Rydberg series in the K2+ yield spectrum.

5 Summary

In summary, the 3s → np photoexcitation resonances of atomic potassium were observed be-
tween 35.5 eV and 40 eV incident photon energy through charge state resolved photoion spec-
troscopy. New paired windows and series of windows were observed for the ﬁrst time and they
were assigned as 3s13p64snp. The assignments have been made based on the results of our
MCDF calculations. The valence 4s electron of K induces the term energy splitting by electron
correlation, and hence, the two states could be resolved. This new dual window feature could
be attributed to 3s13p64s4p 4P and 2P . Since the 4P assignment would mean an LS forbidden
transition, it requires further scrutiny, although the good agreement between the calculated and
observed energy positions is very suggestive. More thorough investigations both theoretically
and experimentally are needed for an unambiguous interpretation of this process.

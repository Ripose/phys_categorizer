Abstract

We examine the properties of cold ions conﬁned by a Paul trap in a linear crystal con-
ﬁguration, a system of considerable current interest due to its application to practical
quantum computation. Using a combination of theoretical and numerical calculation,
a semi-empirical formula for the positions of the ions is derived.

Cold ions conﬁned in electromagnetic traps are rapidly becoming a very impor-
tant system both for the study of fundamental physical systems, such as cold charged
plasmas or quantum chaos, and for technological applications such as optical frequency
standards. Recently a chain of cold ions in a linear trap has been proposed as a pos-
sible means to realize a quantum computer [1]. This idea was conﬁrmed in principal
soon after when an elementary quantum logic gate was realized experimentally using
a trapped Beryllium ion [2], and larger scale devices are currently being pursued by
several experimental groups (see, for example, [3]). Understanding the properties of
collections of conﬁned ions is of great importance to these endeavors.

As is well known [4], it is impossible to conﬁne charged particles by electrostatic
forces alone. To overcome this problem, the radio-frequency Paul trap was developed:
such devices use a electromagnetic ﬁeld varying at radio frequencies (∼ 100 MHz say)
to produce an eﬀective binding potential in three dimensions [5]. When two or more
ions are conﬁned in such a trap, they will repel each other due to the Coulomb force. As
a result, such conﬁned charged plasmas will have very low densities. When suﬃciently
cold, the plasma will condense into a crystalline state. In the highly anisotropic traps
used for some atomic clocks [6] and for quantum computing, this crystalline state is,
for small enough numbers of ions, a simple chain of ions lying in a straight line. As
the degree of anisotropy is decreased, or number of ions is increased, phase changes
to other conﬁgurations will occur: ﬁrstly the ions adopt a zig-zag conﬁguration, and
then a helical conﬁguration. These phase changes have been studies numerically [7]
and analytically [8].

In this letter we present results of new numerical studies of the positions of ions
conﬁned in highly anisotropic traps. This information is of course of considerable
importance in designing trapped ion quantum computers. Using a simple theoretical
argument we then develop a relatively compact expression for the position of each ion,
which depends on the total number of ions conﬁned in the chain. Our results are
compared with both our numerical data, and with results obtained previously by other
authors, and good agreement is obtained.

Consider a chain of N ions conﬁned in a linear trap (ﬁg.1). The position of
the nth ion, where the ions are numbered from left to right, will be denoted by the
position vector relative to the trap center (i.e. the minimum of the binding potential)
Rn(t) = (Xn(t), Yn(t), Zn(t)). The motion of each ion will be inﬂuenced by an overall
harmonic potential due to the trap electrodes, and by the Coulomb force exerted by
all of the other ions. Thus the potential energy of the ions in the ion chain is given by

where M is the mass of each ion, e is the electron charge (the ions are assumed to
be singly ionized), ǫ0 is the permittivity of free space and ωx is the angular frequency
characterizing the strength of the trapping potential in the x direction (and similarly
ωy and ωz for the y and z directions).

The equilibrium positions of the ions, R(0)

where i = (1, 2, 3) denote the X, Y and Z components, respectively.

Let us assume that the trap potentials are suﬃciently strong in the Y and Z
directions and suﬃciently weak in the X direction that in equilibrium the ions lie in a
straight line along the X-axis. Mathematically this assumption is expressed by

R(0)

where ℓ is a scale length given by (e2/4πǫ0Mω2

where sgn(x) = 1 if x > 0 and −1 if x < 0. For N = 2 and N = 3 these equations may
be solved analytically[9]:

u2 = (1/2)2/3,

u2 = 0,

u3 = (5/4)1/3.

For N > 2 it is necessary to solve for the values of um numerically. For small numbers
of ions (N ≤ 100 say) a Newton-Raphson method can be employed to ﬁnd um; however
this becomes ineﬃcient as N gets large. Therefore we used another method, based on
the following set of equations of motion

¨vm(τ ) = − ˙vm(τ ) − vm(τ ) +

(m = 1, 2, . . . N),

(8)

where the single and double dots denote single and double diﬀerentiation with respect
to the dimensionless time variable τ = ωxt. These equations represent a hypothetical
damped oscillation of the ions in the trap, including their mutual Coulomb interaction.
The solutions of these equations have the property that

lim
τ →∞

vm(τ ) = um,

(9)

where um are the desired solutions of eq(5). The integration of eq(8) was carried
out numerically using the standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta method[10]. Because
eq(9) is valid regardless of the initial conditions, the simplest possible initial conditions
were used, i.e. all of the ions being equally spaced. The Runge-Kutta algorithm was
applied repeatedly until the values of um between adjacent iterations were identical to
the seventh decimal place. This was done for up to 1000 ions (although not for all
numbers). The values there by obtained are in agreement with those obtained (for
N ≤ 100) by Newton-Raphson[9]. This dynamic technique can be adapted quite easily
to study classical wave motion in the ion chain; this will be the subject of a forthcoming
paper.

In order to make some sense of the large amount of data generated 2, we will now
derive a analytic formula which approximates the numerical results quite closely. Our
analysis is based on the very elegant idea due to Garg [11]. Let us consider the force
acting on an ion at position X. The Coulomb force due to the two nearest neighbor
ions is

where S− is the distance from the ion to the nearest neighbor on the left, S+ is the
distance to the nearest neighbor on the right and S(X) is the separation of ions at
position X, treated as a continuous function. This is a reasonable approximation
to make for large numbers of ions. The next nearest neighbors are approximately
twice as far away as the nearest neighbors, and so the force they exert on the ion is
approximately Fnn/4; the next pair of ions are three times as far away as the nearest
neighbors, and so the force they exert is approximately Fnn/9, and so on. Thus the
total Coulomb force on the ion will approximately be given by the following expression:

k=1 1/k2 = π2/6 and we have approximated the
where we have used the fact that
ﬁnite sum over all ions as an inﬁnite sum. This approximation should be valid near the
center of the ion chain, but will not yield very good results at the ends of the chain.

The Coulomb force acting on the ion at position X will be balanced by the har-
monic restoring force due to the trap electrodes. Thus we can write the following
identity:

If we introduce the dimensionless ion separation σ(u) = S(X)/ℓ and dimensionless
x)1/3, we
distance from the trap center u = X/ℓ, where, as before ℓ = (e2/4πǫ0Mω2
obtain the following diﬀerential equation for the separation:

This can be solved quite easily, yielding the formula [11]:

where C is a constant, which could be determined from the value of the separation of
ions at the trap center (u = 0).

Let n(u) be the total number of ions which are within a scaled distance u of the

trap center. Clearly n(u) is given by the following diﬀerential equation

On substitution from eq(14), and performing the integration, we obtain the following
formula for n(u):

n(u) = Au − Bu3,

(16)

where we have set n(0) = 0. The constants A and B can be related to the constant
C introduced above. However, instead of attempting to carry this analysis too far,
it is better at this stage to obtain empirical formulas for the the constants A and B
based on our numerical results. This was done by performing a least squares ﬁt of
the numerical data to a cubic formula of the type given by eq(16). The values of A
and B were found for a variety of diﬀerent total numbers of ions. When this data was
compiled, we found that A and B were approximately given by the following power
laws:

A(N) ≈ 0.436N 0.596
B(N) ≈ 0.0375N −0.178,

(17)

(18)

where N is the total number of ions in the chain.

To obtain an expression for the position of the n-th ion in the trap, it is necessary
to invert eq(16). This can be done using the standard formulas for the roots of a cubic
equation [12]. We therefore obtain, taking care to select the correct root based on the
value of n at u = 0, the following formula for the the scaled equilibrium positions of
the n-th ion:

Equation (19) is the main result of this note. As an example we have plotted in
Figure 2 the numerically calculated ion positions together with the positions calculated
using this formula, for a total of 41 ions in the trap. Also we have included experimental
ion position data gleaned from Fig.5 of reference [6]. As can be seen from the ﬁgure,
there is good agreement between the numerical data and the empirical formula. The
diﬀerences between the experimental data and that calculated numerically, may well
be due to the departure of the trapping potential from the harmonic form we have
assumed. The percentage r.m.s. error between the ion positions calculated numerically
and those calculated using eq(18) is shown in Figure 3. The error is only of the order
of a few percent when N > 25, but as expected, errors increase for small numbers of
ions.

For small arguments one can make the approximation sin(sin−1(x)/3) ≈ x/3, and
so, near the trap center [where (n − N + 1/2) is a small number] the scaled ion positions
are given by:

un ≈ 2.29 (n − N + 1/2) N −0.596.

Hence the minimum separation between ions, which is of considerable importance in
quantum computer design [13], is given by

(20)

(21)

umin(N) ≈ 2.29N −0.596.

This result is in good agreement with the empirical formulas previously calculated for
the minimum separation of ions are the trap center [13], [14]. This formula is plotted
in ﬁgure 4, along with the numerical data, and the following formula for the minimum
ion spacing due to Dubin [8] (see also [11]), based on a ﬂuid model for the ion cloud:

umin(N) ≈ 1.92N −2/3 ln(aN)1/3,

(22)

where a = 6eγ−13/5 ≈ 0.794, γ being Euler’s constant. As can been seen from ﬁgure
4, both the empirical formula derived here and the analytic formula due to Dubin
approximate the numerical data quite closely.

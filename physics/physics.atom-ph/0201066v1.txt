Abstract

In the Hartree-Fock approximation the Pauli exclusion principle leads to a Schr¨odinger Eq. of

an integro-diﬀerential form. We describe a new spectral noniterative method (S-IEM), previously

developed for solving the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation with local potentials, which has

now been extended so as to include the exchange nonlocality. We apply it to the restricted case

of electron-Hydrogen scattering in which the bound electron remains in the ground state and the

incident electron has zero angular momentum, and we compare the acuracy and economy of the new

method to three other methods. One is a non-iterative solution (NIEM) of the integral equation

as described by Sams and Kouri in 1969. Another is an iterative method introduced by Kim and

Udagawa in 1990 for nuclear physics applications, which makes an expansion of the solution into

an especially favorable basis obtained by a method of moments. The third one is based on the

Singular Value Decomposition of the exchange term followed by iterations over the remainder. The

S-IEM method turns out to be more accurate by many orders of magnitude than any of the other

three methods described above for the same number of mesh points.

A new very eﬃcient and stable method for solving the Schr¨odinger equation has recently

been developed [1]. This method (S-IEM) solves the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation

rather than the diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation because the numerical errors for the solution

of the former are inherently smaller than for the latter, and by making a spectral expansion of

the solution into Chebyshev polynomials it acquires additional excellent accuracy properties.

This method also avoids the usual drawback of numerical solutions of integral equations,

namely, the need to invert large non-sparse matrices which represent the discretized form

of the equation. It achieves this by dividing the integration interval into partitions and by

making use of the semi-separable nature of the Green’s function in conﬁguration space. The

accuracy of the S-IEM has been tested by comparing it to the solution of the diﬀerential

Schr¨odinger equation for various cases, such as the scattering of cold atoms [2], and for

3

tunneling through a barrier [3], but not by comparing it to existing solutions of the integral

Lippman-Schwinger equation. The purpose of the present paper is two-fold: a) to extend the

S-IEM to the case that there are non-local exchange terms present. This is possible [4], [5]

without losing the original accuracy and stability features since the kernel of the exchange

integral is semi-separable (see below). And b), to compare the accuracy of the extended

S-IEM to conventional methods of solving an integral equation in conﬁguration space.

The scattering of an electron from a hydrogen atom oﬀers a good opportunity for per-

forming such a test, because, integral equation methods have been developed in the past in

order to include the integral exchange terms required by the Pauli exclusion principle, as

is described further below. The present test calculation is physically not realistic since it

does not allow for the polarization of the bound electron cloud by the incident electron, or

the ionization of the atom. But it is still suﬃciently close to realistic so as to serve as an

adequate test for the comparison of diﬀerent algorithms. Realistic calculations which allow

for the polarization of the electron cloud involve coupling between many channels [6], or

else the solution of a two-dimensional diﬀerential equation [7], which is much beyond the

scope of the present work, and is not necessary in order to demonstrate the power of our

new method.

The three methods for solving the non-local Schr¨odinger equation in the presence of the

exchange terms we compare our S-IEM with are as follows. One of these methods [8] solves

an integral equation which is very similar to the one we solve, with the main diﬀerence that

it uses a trapezium type method for numerically expressing the integrals, rather than the

spectral Chebyshev method used in the S-IEM. Another is an iterative method introduced

by Kim and Udagawa in 1990 [9] for nuclear physics applications, which makes an expansion

of the solution into an especially favorable basis obtained by a method of moments. The

third is a variation of a conventional iterative method for including the exchange term. It

consists in expanding the exchange kernel into a small number of separable terms by means

of the Singular Value Decomposition and then iterating over the remainder [10]. Since there

is a rich literature on methods developed for taking the exchange terms into account, a

review of some of the methods most relevant to the S-IEM will be described below.

The scattering of electrons from atoms or molecules has been the subject of investigation

ever since quantum mechanics was introduced, and the research continues unabated, mainly

concerning the scattering of polarized electrons [11] or of high energy photons [12] from

4

atoms or molecules, or charge transfer in ion-molecule scattering [13]. The latter can also be

calculated by using advanced three-body formalisms [14]. One of the features which gives

computational diﬃculties in solving the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation is the Pauli

exclusion principle which requires that the wave function of the incident electron be anti-

symmetric with the wave functions of the electrons in the target atom or molecule. In the

Hartreee-Fock formulation this requirement leads to the presence of non local terms in the

(coupled) diﬀerential equations of the form

∞

Z

0

K(r, r′) u(r′) dr′,

(1)

where u(r) is the required solution and K is the integration kernel due to exchange.

In

the early investigations [15] the exchange terms were taken into account iteratively, by

using Green’s functions deﬁned by the local part of the potential. However, under certain

conditions these iterations do not converge [15], [16]. Methods to accelerate the convergence

have been introduced, but such methods tend to be cumbersome and unpredictable. An

improved iteration procedure can be obtained by means of a separable representation of the

integral kernel[10], as is described further below, but this method has its limitations as well.

An interesting method to include the exchange terms non-iteratively by approximating them

in terms of a separable representations has been developed by Schneider and Collins [17].

Methods to solve the non-local Schr¨odinger equation non iteratively and rigorously have

also been developed [18]. One of the oldest ones originated with I. Percival and R. Marriott

[19]. It consists in constructing auxiliary functions which are solutions of the diﬀerential

equation in the presence of several types of inhomogeneous terms and then constructing

the exact solution (which take into account the integral exchange terms) by means of linear

combinations of the auxiliary functions. A variation of this method was developed by Lamkin

and Temkin [16] for their Polarized Orbitals procedure. In this method the semi-separable

nature of the exchange kernel K

K(r, r′) = A(r) B(r′) f or r′ < r

K(r, r′) = A(r′) B(r) f or r′ > r

(2)

is exploited. The integral of Eq. (1) then becomes

∞

Z
0

K(r, r′) u(r′) dr′ = A(r)

B(r′) u(r′) dr′ + B(r)

A(r′) u(r′) dr′

Again auxiliary functions can be obtained by solving the diﬀerential integral equation with

the constant C set equal to zero or unity. The true solution u(r) is obtained by means of a
0 A(r′) u(r′) dr′ as well
R
as the coeﬃcients of the linear combination can be obtained via the solution of an algebraic

linear combination of the auxiliary functions, and the constant C =

∞

equation. The advantage of this method [16] is that, when the integral over the kernel goes

from 0 to r, as is the case in Eq. (4), the solution of the integro-diﬀerential equation can

be performed easily by starting at the origin and increasing the upper limit gradually from

one meshpoint to the next. With a step size of 0.05 the authors obtain accuracies to about

three signiﬁcant ﬁgures with this method.

A method which yields ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures with the same step size of 0.05 is obtained by

Kouri and co-workers [8]. The main diﬀerence from Temkin’s method [16] is that the authors

ﬁrst transform the integro-diﬀerential equation into a Lippman-Schwinger integral equation,

because integral equations have greater numerical stability than diﬀerential equations. They

again transform the integrals, which originally extend from 0 to

into integrals from

∞

0 to r, plus inhomogeneous terms, thus obtaining Volterra integral equations of the second

kind. They then easily obtain auxiliary solutions to auxiliary Volterra equations by stepping

progressively from the origin to increasing values of r, similarly to what is done in the method

of Temkin .The exact solution, and the respective constants, can then be determined in a

algebraic way similar to what is done in Ref [16]. Smith and Henry [18] have also developed

methods to solve the Volterra type integral equations non iteratively. These methods are

generally called NIEM, where the “N” stands for “Non-iterative”. Collins and Schneider

also have examined the NIEM form of the non-local Schr¨odinger equation, [20] but without

transforming it into a Volterra type. By discretizing the integral via the trapezoidal rule,

they obtain a linear algebraic equation for the wave functions at the mesh points, and for

this reason the method is called (LA). The formulation of the initial equation to be solved

by our new method is very similar to that of [20]. The main diﬀerences, to be discussed

below, arise from the numerical techniques used in the solution of these equations (NIEM).

For the case of the exchange terms which are due to the Coulomb interaction, as is the case

for most atomic physics calsulations, the exchange terms can also be replaced by coupling

6

to a set of ”pseudo-states, a technique which is made use of in the work of Weatherford,

Onda and Temkin [21], and is also illustrated in the present work.

Other methods have been developed to solve the electron-atom scattering equations. One

consist in introducing a set of basis functions such as Laguerre polynomials, and expanding

both the solution and the target states into this basis [22]. Another such expansion basis

utilizes sturmian functions[23]. In these procedures the exchange integrals can be carried

out, since they contain the known basis wave functions. Finite element representations have

also been applied [24]. The R-matrix approach is also well developed [25] .

As already brieﬂy mentioned above, our new “spectral integral equation method”, S-

IEM, transforms the diﬀerential equation into an equivalent Lippmann-Schwinger integral

equation through the use of Green’s functions, similar to what is done in the older approaches

described above. It diﬀers from the older methods in that it uses the Fredholm form of the

integral equation (whose range of integration is from 0 to rmax ), as done in Ref.

[20],

and does not transform it into a Volterra type (whose range of integration is from 0 to the

variable radial distance r). It thus it avoids the need to evaluate the constants C which occur

in theVolterra method, but instead it has to solve for a larger number of other constants.

The latter arise by dividing the radial integration interval [0 rmax] into partitions, and by

expanding the solution in each partition into two independent functions which in turn are

obtained by solving a local integral equation through the spectral expansion into Chebyshev

Polynomials. There are twice as many such coeﬃcients as there are partitions, and hence the

matrix from which the coeﬃcients are calculated is large, say 600

600. However, this matrix

×

is sparse, and hence soluble economically. As is shown here, the semi-separable structure

of the exchange nonlocality allows us to preserve the sparseness in the present case as well.

If, however, the nonlocal potential is not of the semi-separable form our integral equation

method still gives stable and accurate solutions, but then the biggest matrix involved is

no longer sparse [26]. From the numerical point of view, the main diﬀerence of our S-IEM

from other integral equation methods described above is that the radial mesh-points in the

S-IEM are not equidistant, while those for the latter are. The numerical errors of the latter

are of the ﬁnite diﬀerence type, and are given by a ﬁxed power of the distance between

mesh points, while in the S-IEM the errors become smaller than any power of the distance

between mesh points. Or, more precisely, in the S-IEM the errors become smaller than any

inverse power of the number of Chebyshev support points in each partition, a property which

7

expresses the spectral nature of the S-IEM. This property permits the S-IEM to have far

fewer mesh points than the more conventional discretization formulations of diﬀerential or

integral equations for a given envisaged accuracy, as will be demonstrated in Fig. 4 below.

The ﬁrst of our three comparison methods [10] consists in replacing the exchange kernel by

a small number of fully separable terms, and carrying out iterations only over the remainder.

This is possible because, as is well known, the Green’s function for a Schr¨odinger equation

with both local and non local but fully separable potentials can be obtained without much

diﬃculty by adding terms to the Green’s function distorted only by the local potential. Our

second method [9] is a modiﬁed integral equation method, denoted as M-IEM. It uses a set of

basis functions which are obtained by applying successively higher powers of the hamiltonian

operator with local potentials on an initial scattering wave function. This method has been

very successful in applications to nuclear physics problems. The third method [1], the S-

IEM, uses the Lippmann-Schwinger integral form of the Schr¨odinger equation.

It diﬀers

from a previously introduced non-iterative solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral

equation, denoted as NIEM [18], in that it uses non-equidistant mesh points, divides the

radial interval into partitions of adjustable size, and uses a very accurate spectral integration

technique involving Chebyshev polynomials. Because of its inherent stability the S-IEM is

likely the method of choice [2] for situations requiring solutions out to large distances. The

generalization of this method so as to include the exchange potential [4], [5] is described

further below.

In section 2 the basic equation to be solved will be described; in sections 3, 4 and 5

the S-IEM, the SVD-improved iterative method, and the method of moments, respectively,

will be reviewed; in section 6 the numerical comparison between the four methods will be

described; section 7 contains the summary and conclusion; and Appendix 1 contains further

details of the extension of the S-IEM to the presence of exchange.

The reason that it is possible here to replace a nonlocality by an equivalent added channel

is that the Green’s function which corresponds to the operator d2/dx2 is given by the product

f (x<)g(x>) , with f (x) = x and g(x) = 1. This equivalence is due to the fact that [21] the

Coulomb interaction 1/r12, which appears in the ﬁrst nonlocal term in

, is closely related to

the Laplacian d2/dx2. For angular momenta L other than zero it is suﬃcient to add the term

ℑ

L(L + 1)/x2 into the square bracket of the second equation above. Whether the addition of

extra channels is feasible for exchange interactions diﬀerent from the Coulomb interaction

remains to be investigated.

The above equations (19) are a set of inhomogeneous coupled equations which can be

solved by conventional numerical means. However for more general semi-separable non-

localities, which cannot be reduced to a set of equivalent coupled equations, the methods

of solving Eq. (11) presented in the next sections can be used. The question of whether

an exchange nonlocality gives eﬀects which are similar to a nonlocality due to coupling to

inelastic channels has been examined by many authors. For certain nuclear scattering cases

the two nonlocalities gave quite diﬀerent results[28]. It is easy to understand the diﬀerence

from Eqs. (19) above, since in the exchange case the second channel contains no energy,

and a inhomogeneous term is present, while both features are absent in the inelastic coupled

channel case.

III. THE INTEGRAL EQUATION METHOD (S-IEM)

In this section we describe how the previously developed spectral integral equation

method for local potentials [1] can be extended so as to include the exchange terms. We

drop the channel subscripts, since the equation being discussed contains only one channel,

and for ease of notation we replace the function R0(x) in equation (11) by ϕ(x). In the

integral equation method S-IEM [1], the diﬀerential equation (11) is transformed into the

equivalent integral equation

ϕ(x) = sin(kx) +

(x, x′)V (x′)ϕ(x′)dx′ +

(x, x′′)ϕ(x′′)dx′′.

although not sparse, have a structure such that they can still be evaluated economically

[26]. However, if the nonlocality

is semi-separable, as is the case when it results from

exchange terms, then it can be shown [4], [5], that the kernel

, Eq. (23) also is semi-

separable and is of rank 2. Even though the resulting expression for

is not as simple as

the rank 1 expression (22) for

, the conventional IEM method for local potentials can be

extended to this case, as will be shown below. The advantage of this technique is that the

”big” matrix, which occurs in the process of piecing together the local solutions obtained for

each partition, is a sparse band limited matrix, and hence the complexity of the calculation

remains proportional to the number of partitions m, rather than being of power m3, as would

be the case with general non-sparse matrices. However, the complexity of the calculation

also contains a factor which increases like the cube of the number of bands, which, in the

F

hence the complexity of the calculation increases by an overall factor of eight.

It can be written in concise form as

The radial distance x is contained in the range 0

chosen suﬃciently large so that beyond rmax the integrands can be neglected. We start by

dividing the interval [0, rmax] into m partitions [b0, b1],

[b1, b2], . . . , [bi−1, bi], . . . [bm−1, bm],

where the points bi are not necessarily equispaced, similarly to what was done in [1]. Next

we show that in each interval i the global solution φ can be found as a linear combination of

four local solutions of equation (36) restricted to each of the subintervals of partition. Let

Ki denote the operator K restricted to act only in the subinterval [bi−1, bi]. For example, Ki

operating on the function η is given by

(Kiη)(x) =

Then, in terms of Ki, equation (36) can be rewritten as

where use has been made of the fact that p1(x) = sin(kx). This result can be obtained

(see Ref.

[1]) by decomposing the integrals in equation (36) into three domains:

[0, bi−1],

[bi−1, bi], and [bi, rmax].The second domain gives rise to the operator Ki. Accordingly the

In view of the fact that the operator Ki is linear, the solution φ(x) of equation (37) in each

This result allows one to relate the constants A, B, C, D in subinterval i with those in other

subintervals j, by inserting (46) into equations (38)-(41). The resulting equations, described

in Appendix 1, can be transformed into a block tridiagonal-system, similarly to what was

done in our previous work, [1],

It is noteworthy that the structure of the matrix in Eq.(47) is very similar to the structure

points per partition, 16, is larger than p = 7, it is clear that the overall cost will be dominated

by the cost of solving Eqs. (42) in all partitions, which is of order 163m

IV. THE SVD-IMPROVED ITERATIVE METHOD.

The ﬁrst of our three comparison methods consists in replacing the exchange kernel by a

small number of fully separable terms, and carrying out iterations only over the remainder,

as will be described in this section, and as is given with more detail in Ref.

[10]. As is

well known, the Green’s function for a Schr¨odinger equation with both local and non local

but fully separable potentials can be obtained without much diﬃculty by adding terms to

16

the Green’s function distorted only by the local potential. By contrast, the older iterative

method of taking the nonlocal kernel into account perturbatively consists in writing Eq.

(11) in the form

V (x1) + k2

R0(x1) =

(53)

(54)

as is well known. The functions f and g are normalized such that their Wronskian is equal

to k. The iteration is started by using the solution in the absence of the exchange terms for
the ﬁrst (n = 0) guess R(0)

0 = f (x2).

The rate of convergence of the iterations depends on the norm of

(x′, x′′) dx′.

This norm in turn depends on the norm of

GV . The latter becomes
ℑ
large at small incident energies k2, in view of the presence of the factor 1/k in Eq. (53), and

, and on the norm of

hence the iteration will diverge for a suﬃciently small value of k. The rate of convergence

also depends on the

sign in front of the exchange integrals, as was found in the numerical

±

examples described below. This eﬀect does not occur in the other methods described in this

paper because the latter do not make use of the iteration on

∓FV .

In what follows in this section, we describe a method, to be denoted as SVD, which

reduces the norm of the nonlocal kernel

by decomposing it into a sum of a fully separable

ℑ

17

kernel of low rank plus a remainder. The separable terms are placed in the left hand side of

Eq. (50), the Green’s function in the presence of both the local distorting potential V and

the separable nonlocal pieces of the kernel is obtained, and hence iterations of the form of

Eq. (51) can be carried out, where

is now the residual kernel. This way the ”k”-divergence

ℑ

can be shifted to smaller values of k, but it cannot be avoided.

A. The separable content of the nonlocal kernel.

The singular value decomposition method (SVD) [30] is used to decompose the kernel

(x1, x2) into a number of fully separable terms plus a remainder. The method is as fol-

ℑ
lows. First a numerical integration algorithm is chosen which divides the range of integration

[0, Rmax] into a set of N discrete points. Correspondingly the kernel

(x1, x2) is transformed

into a N

N matrix K(i, j), with i, j = 1, 2, ..N. We next perform a singular value decom-

position on K. The SVD method is based on a theorem of linear algebra according to which

any M

N matrix K can be written as the product of an M

M orthogonal matrix U,

ℑ

×

an M

N diagonal matrix Σ with positive or zero elements, and the transpose of an N

N orthogonal matrix V . ( A matrix U is orthogonal if UU T = U T U = I, which means

×
that its columns are normalized and orthogonal to each other, and so are the rows.) For our

×

×

×

purpose it is suﬃcient to consider the case N = M. In this case we can rigorously write

K = U Σ V T =

σsusvT
s

N

Xs=1

where the columns of U and V are the column vectors us, and vs, respectively, and Σ is a

diagonal matrix of the non-negative quantities σs, s = 1, 2, ...N, ordered by decreasing size

(the largest ones ﬁrst). The latter are the ”singular values”. As a result of the above, a fully

separable piece of rank n can be separated out of the matrix K, leaving a residual matrix

K R,

by carrying the sum in Eq.(55) to a upper limit n which includes only the largest values σs.

B. Greens function for a separable potential.

In order to obtain the Green’s function

potential V and the fully separable Kernel K S, we rewrite Eq. (51) symbolically in the form

ψ(x) = f (x) +

where the integration over the variables is implicitly assumed. For simplicity, let us assume

that only two terms in K S are responsible for the divergence of the iterative Green’s function

V. THE MODIFIED INTEGRAL EQUATION METHOD (M-IEM)

In this section we describe the method proposed by Kim and Udagawa[9], which we call

the modiﬁed integral equation method (M-IEM). The method is well documented in the

literature, and hence only a brief description is given here.

It starts from the following

equation obtained by rewriting Eq.(11);

We then transform the equation into the integral form as

where ϕ(0)(x) and

′(x, x′) satisfy

The equation we solve is (68). Since both ϕ(0)(x) and

′(x, x′′) are deﬁned in terms of the

G

local potential V (x), they can be calculated without any problem. This means that once

the solution λ(x) of Eq.(68) is obtained, then ϕ(x) can be calculated from Eq. (65).

In solving Eq.(68), use is made of the Lanczos method [31]. It is worth noting that the

application of the Lanczos method for solving Eq.(68) is possible, since λ(x) is a bounded

function, as can be seen from the fact that it is essentially given in terms of the bounded
(x, x′). This makes it possible to expand λ(x) in terms of an

nonlocal potential function

ℑ

orthonormal set of functions, as is done in Eq.(74) below. This is not the case for ϕ(x) in

Eq.(65), since ϕ(x) is not bounded.

We ﬁrst expand λ(x) in terms of the orthonormal set of functions Di(x) with i =

0, 1, 2, ....., Ni which are generated as follows:

λ(0)(x),

The normalization constant di in Eqs.(70) and (71) is determined from the condition

FIG. 1: Dependence of the singlet (+) and triplet (-) L = 0 phase shifts on the incident wave

number, displayed in the form k/ tan(δ). Where these curves pass through zero, tan(δ) goes

through inﬁnity, as is shown in the next two ﬁgures. Neither the M-IEM or the S-IEM had any

diﬃculty evaluating these quantities either for the small values of k or in the vicinity of the zeros.

The values of Cj are then determined by solving Eq.(75). Note that Eq.(75) can be solved

rather easily, because αj i = 0 for j > i + 1 (see Eq.(72)). In addition, the value of Ni can be

chosen as a small number. This helps greatly in making the actual numerical calculations

very fast.

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The bench-test calculation performed by the three methods described above consists in

obtaining the L = 0 phase shift for the scattering of an electron from the ground-state of an

Hydrogen atom, in the presence of exchange terms, both for the singlet and the triplet states,
δ(+) and δ(−) , respectively. The methods are the S-IEM, the SVD, and the M-IEM. The

older integral equation method is denoted as NIEM (the ”N” stands for non-iterative), and

a representative result is taken from the paper by Sams and Kouri [8], since these authors

describe their accuracy for exactly the same test case as ours. The SVD, M-IEM and the

NIEM methods use equi-spaced mesh points, since their auxiliary functions are the solutions

of local diﬀerential equations using ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, while the S-IEM, as mentioned

above, uses non-equispaced mesh points, which are the zeros of a Chebyshev polynomial of

a certain order (16 in this case), in each of the partitions into which the radial interval is

decomposed.

The k dependence of the phase shifts is shown in Fig. 1, by plotting the ratio k/ tan(δ).

When either of the two curves crosses the 0 line, the corresponding value of tan(δ) becomes

inﬁnite,as is shown in Figs. (2) and (3), and the respective phases shift have the value π/2,

modulus π. Both the M-IEM and the S-IEM methods had no diﬃculty in reproducing the

singularity in tan(δ), and both were able to reach arbitrarily small values of the momentum
k. By contrast, the SVD method could not obtain results for k < 1.0(a0)−1.

Since well documented accuracy studies exist for the NIEM [8] we examined the rate of

convergence of the phase shift as a function of number the mesh points for a case which

is treated in Ref.

[8]. The case chosen is the singlet phase shift with exchange, δ(+). The

higher accuracy with a smaller number of points than the other methods shown. With 160

mesh points (the corresponding number of partitions is 10) the value obtained for δ(+) =

1.87015788462442 rad. is the same , to within the quoted number of 15 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,

as the result for 224 mesh points. This is close to machine accuracy, and shows that the

accumulation of round-oﬀ errors is small in the S-IEM method, conﬁrming previous studies.

(See Fig. 1 in the 1997 paper quoted in Ref. [1]). The discrepancy in the seventh signiﬁcant

ﬁgure between the S-IEM and the M-IEM could be due to the fact that only ﬁve basis

functions were used for the latter. This point has not been investigated further.

The scattering length a and eﬀective range re for this one state electron-hydrogen scat-

tering calculation have also been examined. The procedure is similar to the one used for a

previous atom-atom scattering bench-mark calculation [2]. It is based on the low momentum

expansion of the scattering phase shift

k cot δ0 =

+ rek2 + O(k3).

(76)

The left hand side of the above expression is calculated for two very small values of the

wave number k , diﬀering by a factor of two, and the values of a and re are solved for. The

procedure is repeated for decreasing values of k and increasing values of the maximum radial

distance rmax and of the number of mesh-points until stability in the results is found to a

given number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For the values of a and re listed in the tables below for

the S-IEM method, values of k

50 and approximately 1000 mesh points

10−5 , rmax ≈

≈

were found to be adequate. However, contrary to what was done in Ref.

[2], the value of

rmax was not extrapolated to

via a perturbative method. For the M-IEM case, the values

∞

of a and re in Table IV are extracted from Eq. 76 by calculating k cot δ0 for the two values

of k = 0.00001 and 0.01, and for T = 20. Excellent agreement with the S-IEM values is

obtained.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.

In this paper four methods were compared to solve the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger

equation in the presence of the exchange nonlocality for the case of electron scattering from

a hydrogen atom, with only the lowest energy state of the bound electron being included.

The oldest method in the literature proceeds by ﬁrst solving the equation in the presence

26

of only the local potential, and then including the nonlocal part through Green’s function

iteration. The iterations converge only for a limited range of parameters, and one of the

methods described here improves upon the convergence by separating out of the nonlocal

kernel a fully separable part by means of the Singular Value Decomposition method (SVD).

By this means the region of convergence could be extended to a larger domain, but for our
example convergence still fails at small values of the momentum, k < 0.1(a0)−1 and the

maximum accuracy achieved was ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Another method was developed

in the literature, in which the diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation is ﬁrst transformed into

an Lippman-Schwinger integral equation, and is then solved non-iteratively (NIEM). In

our example, taken from the literature [8], this method achieved six signiﬁcant ﬁgures of

accuracy, but appears not to work for small values of the incident momentum. Improved

accuracy and the viability for all values of k was achieved in the present study by extending

a previously developed spectral solution of a Lippman-Schwinger integral equation with

local potentials [1], [2], to the case with an exchange-type nonlocality. This extension was

possible because the exchange nonlocality is of a semi-separable character. The resulting

method (S-IEM) gives substantially higher accuracy (15 signiﬁcant ﬁgures) than the NIEM,

and converges much faster with the number of mesh-point in the integration interval than

the NIEM, as is illustrated in Fig. 4. A fourth method, (M-IEM) developed previously

for nonlocalities occurring in nuclear physics [9] achieves seven ﬁgures of accuracy, and has

no diﬃculty in coping with small values of k. The rate of convergence of this method was

comparable to that of the NIEM. The reason is due to the fact that the auxiliary functions

needed for both methods, as well as the integration algorithms, are based on a ﬁnite diﬀerence

algorithm, whose error usually decreases inversely with the number of mesh points according

to a well deﬁned power. From inspection of Fig. 4, this power has the relatively low value of

2.5. Both the M-IEM and the SVD methods have the advantage that they can be used for

non-localities which are more general than the semi-separable exchange ones. The S-IEM

also can be applied to these cases, but, at its present stage of development, the large matrix

in Eq. 47 is then no longer sparse [26].

In summary, four methods of calculating the scattering phase shift in electron atom

collision were compared for a numerical test case, and the advantages and disadvantages of

each were discussed.

Using elementary row operations on equation (77) and then changing the order of the vari-

ables, the coeﬃcient matrix of equation (77) can be transformed into the block tridiagonal

system (47) to (49), given in the text. Further details can be found in Ref. [1].

Exact Dirac equation calculation of ionization induced by

ultrarelativistic heavy ions

Abstract

The time-dependent Dirac equation can be solved exactly for ionization in-

duced by ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.

Ionization calculations are

carried out in such a framework for a number of representative ion-ion pairs.

For each ion-ion pair, the computed cross section consists of two terms, a con-

stant energy independent term and a term whose coeﬃcient is ln γ. Scaled

values of both terms are found to decrease with increasing Z of the nucleus

that is ionized.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent work [1] an exact semiclassical Dirac equation calculation of ionization prob-

abilities was presented. The case considered was colliding Pb + Pb at ultrarelativistic

energies. A single electron was taken to be bound to one nucleus with the other nucleus

completely stripped. The probability that the electron would be ionized in the collision was

calculated as a function of impact parameter, but no cross sections were presented. In this

paper the approach of Ref. [1] is extended in order to calculate ionization cross sections

for a number of representative cases of collisions involving Pb, Zr, Ca, Ne and H ions. In

Section II the exact semiclassical method is reviewed and calculations of impact parameter

1

dependent ionization probabilities are presented. In Section III the results of the probability

calculations are used to construct cross sections for various ion-ion collision combinations in

the form

σ = A ln γ + B

(1)

where A and B are constants for a given ion-ion pair and γ (= 1/√1

v2) is the relativistic

−

factor one of the ions seen from the rest frame of the other. Comparisons are made with

previous ionization calculations. In Section IV the example of Pb + Pb at the AGS, CERN

SPS, and RHIC is worked out and the CERN SPS case is compared with data.

II. IMPACT PARAMETER DEPENDENT PROBABILITIES

If one works in the appropriate gauge [2], then the Coulomb potential produced by an

ultrarelativistic particle (such as a heavy ion) in uniform motion can be expressed in the

following form [3]

V (ρ, z, t) =

δ(z

t)αZP (1

αz) ln

−

−

−

(b

ρ)2

.

−
b2

(2)

b is the impact parameter, perpendicular to the z–axis along which the ion travels, ρ, z, and

t are the coordinates of the potential relative to a ﬁxed target (or ion), αz is the Dirac matrix,

α is the ﬁne structure constant, with ZP and v the charge and velocity of the moving ion.

This is the physically relevant ultrarelativistic potential since it was obtained by ignoring

terms in (b

ρ)/γ2 [3] [2]. As will be shown in Section II, when b becomes large enough

−

that the expression Eq.(2) is inaccurate, we match onto a Weizsacker-Williams expression

which is valid for large b. Note that the b2 in the denominator of the logarithm in Eq.(2) is

removable by a gauge transformation, and we retain the option of keeping or removing it as

convenient.

It was shown in Ref. [1] that the δ function allows the Dirac equation to be solved exactly

at the point of interaction, z = t. Exact amplitudes then take the form

where j is the initial state and f the ﬁnal state. This ampltude is in the same form as the

perturbation theory amplitude, but with an eﬀective potential to represent all the higher

order eﬀects exactly,

in place of the potential of Eq.(2).

Since an exact solution must be unitary, the ionization probability (the sum of probabil-

ities of excitation from the single bound electron to particular continuum states) is equal to

the deﬁcit of the ﬁnal bound state electron population

P (b) = 1

P (b)

The sum of bound state probabilities includes the probability that the electron remains in

the ground state plus the sum of probabilities that it ends up in an excited bound state.

From Eq.(3) one may obtain in simple form the exact survival probability of an initial state

In principle the ionization probability can be calculated without reference to ﬁnal continuum

states. In practice ionization will be calculated both as a sum of continuum probabilities as

well as the deﬁcit of bound state probabilities.

Table I shows the results of ionization calculations for an ultrarelativistic Pb + Pb

collision. One of the Pb ions has an electron initially in the ground state. The other is

completely ionized. Final state probabilities for the electron are calculated as a function of

impact parameter b. Calculations have been carried out with a logarithmic spacing in values

of b, with the range of b chosen to go from constant probabiity of ionization at the low end

to 1/b2 behavior at the high end. The last column which is the sum of ﬁnal bound state

3

(column 3) and ﬁnal continuum state (column 4) population exhibits a small deﬁcit from

unity, presumably mostly from the truncation of the energy sum over excited continuum

states or secondarily from the truncation of the bound state sum in the calculations.

Tables II and III show corresponding calculations for Ca + Ca, and Ne + Ne.

III. CROSS SECTIONS

The actual cross section comes from the impact parameter integral

σion = 2π

P (b) b db.

Z

(7)

As was exempliﬁed in Tables I-III, for each ion-ion case calculation of probabilities was

performed at ten impact parameters, in a scheme of sequential doubling. The points ran

from an impact parameter small enough that the probabilities were approximately constant

with b, to an impact parameter large enough that the probabilities had started to fall oﬀ as

1/b2. The part of the integral, Eq.(7), over this region from the ﬁrst to the tenth impact

parameter takes the form of sum of nine integrals on a logarithmic scale

σ1−10 = π ln 2

i+1).

Xi=1,9

Since the probability goes to a constant at the lowest impact parameter, b1, the contri-

bution to Eq. (7) from zero up to b1 is given simply by

We now need the contribution from the last point computed, b10, out to where P (b) cuts

oﬀ. We match a Weizsacker-Williams type calculation to the exact calculation at this b10

σ0−1 = πP (b1)b2

in order to determine the normalization for the calculation of probabilities at larger impact

parameters and to make the high end cutoﬀ in b. How the calculation in the delta function

gauge and the calculation in the Weizsacker-Williams formulation are equivalent at this

matching impact parameter b10 is presented in Appendix A.

The A ln γ term is entirely from the non-perturbative, large impact parameter region

and gives the beam energy dependence arising from the impact parameter cutoﬀ at b

(see Eqns. (15) and (16)). Despite the form of Eq.(20) A does not really depend on the

matching impact parameter b10 since b10 is in the region where P (b)

1/b2. The B term

∼

is independent of beam energy and contains non-perturbative components from the smaller

impact parameters.

Table IV shows the results of calculations of the ionization cross section components A

and B for symmetric ion-ion pairs. There is good agreement between the cross sections

calculated by subtracting the bound state probabilities from unity (ﬁrst rows) or calculated

by summing continuum electron ﬁnal states (second rows). The agreement with the Anholt

and Becker calculations [4] in the literature is good for the lighter species for both A and

B. However with increasing mass of the ions the perturbative energy dependent term A

decreases in the present calculations whereas it increases in the Anholt and Becker calcula-

tions. The greatest discrepancy is for Pb + Pb, with Anholt and Becker being about 60%

6

higher. Perhaps this discrepancy is due to the fact that Anholt and Becker use approximate

relativistic bound state wave functions and the present calculations utilize exact Dirac wave

functions for the bound states. Surprisingly, it is the term B (which has the non-perturbative

component) where agreement is relatively good between Anholt and Becker and the present

calculations of Table IV.

Table V shows results of the calculation of B (multiplied by Z 2

2 /Z 2

1 ) for a number of

representative non-symmetric ion-ion pairs.

(Since A is perturbative, scaling as Z 2

1 , its

value can be taken from Table IV for the various pairs here.) Note that if one goes to the

perturbative limit for a Pb target to be ionized (H + Pb or Ne +Pb) then the scaled B values

(17,090, 17,030) are some 30% higher than the necessarily perturbative Anholt and Becker

value of 13,000. The good agreement of Anholt and Becker with the present calculations for

Pb + Pb B seen in Table IV is thus somewhat fortuitous.

IV. AN EXAMPLE

Table VI presents calculated ionization cross sections for Pb + Pb at the AGS, the CERN

SPS, and RHIC. CERN SPS data of Pb with a single electron impinging on a Au target has

recently been published by Krause et al. [5]. Their measured cross section of 42,000 barns

is signiﬁcantly smaller than the Anholt and Becker calculation (which includes screening in

the target Au) of about 63,600 barns. The result of the present Pb + Pb calculation (55,800

to 58,200 barns) does not include screening and should be compared with the corresponding

no-screening calculation of Anholt and Becker (83,700 barns). What was essentially the

present Pb + Pb result was privately communicated to Krause et al., and they seem to have

then assumed that if screening were to be included, then the present calculation should be

scaled by the ratio of the Anholt and Becker screened to unscreened results. They comment

in their paper, “With screening included [4] and scaled to a Au target, the Baltz value agrees

with the σi measured in the ionization experiment (4.2

104 b).”

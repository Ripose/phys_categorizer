Abstract

Wave packet propagation in the basis of interpolating scaling functions (ISF) is stud-
ied. The ISF are well known in the multiresolution analysis based on spline biorthog-
onal wavelets. The ISF form a cardinal basis set corresponding to an equidistantly
spaced grid. They have compact support of the size determined by the order of the
underlying interpolating polynomial that is used to generate ISF. In this basis the po-
tential energy matrix is diagonal and the kinetic energy matrix is sparse and, in the 1D
case, has a band-diagonal structure. An important feature of the basis is that matrix
elements of a Hamiltonian are exactly computed by means of simple algebraic trans-
formations eﬃciently implemented numerically. Therefore the number of grid points
and the order of the underlying interpolating polynomial can easily be varied allowing
one to approach the accuracy of pseudospectral methods in a regular manner, simi-
lar to high order ﬁnite diﬀerence methods. The results of numerical simulation of a
H+H2 collinear collision show that the ISF provide one with an accurate and eﬃcient
representation for use in the wave packet propagation method.

1 Introduction

A direct on-the-grid solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) has be-
come a common tool in quantum chemistry. In a dynamical context, it provides with quan-
titative predictions on the eﬃciency of diﬀerent pathways of chemical reactions and deepens
our understanding of their details [1, 2, 3]. Approaches based on the TDSE in connec-
tion with the ﬁlter diagonalization technique [4] are also used in the static context in order
to compute states of complex molecules [5, 6]. To simulate the time evolution of a wave
packet, repeated computations of the action of the system Hamiltonian H, or its exponen-
tial exp(−i∆tH), on the wave function Ψ are required. Here ∆t is a time step. Therefore a
lot of eﬀort has been devoted to developing accurate and eﬃcient methods to reduce com-
putational costs of computing HΨ. The numerical techniques used can be classiﬁed into
several categories: (i) ﬁnite diﬀerences (FD), (ii) ﬁnite elements (FE), (iii) pseudospectral
global grid representation approaches such as the discrete variable representation (DVR)
and Fourier grid Hamiltonian method (FGH) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Finite diﬀerences and ﬁnite
elements lead to a sparse Hamiltonian matrix but exhibit a slow algebraic convergence with
the number of grid points. The pseudospectral approaches result in dense Hamiltonian ma-
trices, which, a priori, increases the number of operations needed to compute HΨ. At the
same time, the exponential convergence with the number of grid points counterbalances the
aforementioned drawback. This is why pseudospectral methods are so widely used in time-
dependent molecular dynamics [1, 2, 3, 12], as well as in stationary S-matrix [13, 14, 15]
and eigenvalue [6] calculations. In particular, the FGH method based on the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) algorithm is very advantageous since for a mesh of N points the action of
the kinetic energy operator is computed by N log2 N elementary multiplications and is easily
implemented numerically [16].

When discussing the slow algebraic convergence of ﬁnite diﬀerences and ﬁnite elements,
one usually refers to the convergence with the number of grid points while the order of
ﬁnite diﬀerences or the order of the polynomial for ﬁnite elements is kept ﬁxed. In fact, an
exponential (spectral) convergence can be achieved if not only the number of grid points, but
also the order of the underlying polynomial is increased [7, 17]. Exploiting this property, as
well as the sparsity of the Hamiltonian matrix and the possibility to distribute mesh points
only along the reaction path, thus reducing the size of calculation, makes the high order FD
and FE a competitive alternative to pseudospectral methods. Much work has recently been
devoted to developing these techniques [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].

In this paper we present a treatment of reactive scattering based on the wave function
representation in the basis of interpolating scaling functions corresponding to interpolating
(spline) wavelets [28]. Basis functions are generated from a single function, called the scaling
function, by appropriate scalings and shifts of its argument. The scaling function is a solution
of a functional equation which is found iteratively by using interpolating polynomials of a
speciﬁc order. By construction, the basis functions have compact support with the width
determined by the order of the interpolating polynomial and the resolution level (the mesh

2

step). The basis is biorthogonal and cardinal, which leads to a simple representation of the
wave function. The resulting Hamiltonian matrix is sparse. The potential energy matrix
appears to be diagonal, while, in the one dimensional case, the kinetic energy matrix is band
diagonal with the band width determined by the size of support of the scaling function.
Matrix elements of the kinetic energy operator can be evaluated exactly via simple algebraic
operations so that the order of the underlying interpolating polynomial and the step of the
mesh can easily be varied allowing one to achieve a fast convergence. Thus our algorithm
oﬀers ﬂexibility similar to that achieved in the case of ﬁnite diﬀerences of an arbitrary
order with the Fornberg algorithm [7, 26]. In fact, the proposed approach can be seen as
an alternative to high-order ﬁnite diﬀerence techniques. Applications of the method are
illustrated with the example of a collinear H+H2 collision.

2 Theory

2.1 Biorthogonal spline bases

Here we summarize some necessary facts about interpolating biorthogonal bases of scaling
functions in the space of square integrable functions and describe the algorithm to construct
such bases. Biorthonormal bases of scaling functions are used in the multiresolution analysis
associated with interpolating wavelets. A more detailed description of such bases can be
found in the mathematical literature, e.g., [27, 28, 29].

In general, a biorthogonal basis consists of two sets of elements φa(x) and ˜φa(x) where
the index a labels the basis elements. Any function Ψ(x) can be decomposed into a linear
combination of the basis functions φa(x),

where the decomposition coeﬃcients are determined by the dual basis functions

The basis is (bi)orthogonal in the sense that

Consider a special class of biorthogonal bases that provide a multiresolution analysis. A
biorthogonal basis with a multiresolution analysis is generated by a scaling function φ(x)
and its dual ˜φ(x) which satisfy accordingly the equations (the scaling relations)

where the real coeﬃcients hk (˜hk) are called a (dual) ﬁlter. The scaling function and its dual
are required to be orthogonal in the sense that

dx ˜φ(x)φ(x − j) = δ0j

Z

for all integers j. The orthogonality relation imposes a condition on the ﬁlters which is
readily deduced from (6) by substituting the scaling relations (4) and (5) are rescaling the
integraion variable.

Consider two sets of functions, labeled by two integers n and j,

φn,j(x) = 2n/2φ(2nx − j) ,

˜φn,j(x) = 2n/2 ˜φ(2nx − j) .

Subspaces Vn of the space of square integrable functions spanned by φn,j with a ﬁxed value
of n form a ladder structure

It is straightforward to convince oneself that φn,j form a biorthogonal basis in Vn:

· · · ⊆ Vn ⊆ Vn+1 ⊆ · · · .

dx ˜φn,j(x)φn,j′(x) = δjj′ .

Z

Any function Ψ can be projected on a subspace Vn,

Pn : Ψ(x) → Ψn(x) =

sn,jφn,j(x) ,

sn,j =

dx ˜φn,j(x)Ψ(x) .

(10)

Xj

Z

Taking successively larger values of n allows one to reproduce a successively ﬁner structure
of Ψ. Thus, the index n speciﬁes a resolution level. If the ﬁlters are ﬁnite, then the scaling
function φ has ﬁnite support and so do the basis functions φn,j. The index j is then naturally
associated with the position of support of φn,j.

A special class of biorthogonal bases is obtained when ﬁlters are ﬁnite and of a special

form

hk =
˜hk = δk0 ,

φ(k/2) ,

k = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., ±m ,

˜φ(x) = δ(x) .

The expansion coeﬃcients are simply values of the function at dyadic lattice sites

sn,j = 2−n/2Ψ(2−nj) .

Larger values of the resolution level n correspond to ﬁner grids. In what follows m is chosen
to be odd for convenience.

To ﬁnd the ﬁlter hk and an explicit form of the scaling function φ(x), Eq. (4) is solved
iteratively for φ(x). First, one observes that the equation is satisﬁed at the integer valued

argument by φ(l) = δ0l with h0 = 1
2. Thus, the scaling function vanishes at integral x except
for x = 0 where φ(0) = 1 as is required by the orthogonality condition (6) with our choice of
the ﬁlters (11) and (12). To compute φ(x) at half-integer values of the argument, φ(j + 1/2)
(j is a ﬁxed integer), one uses the polynomial (spline) interpolation with polynomials P (j)
m of
order m passing through M = (m + 1)/2 integer points neighboring to x = j + 1/2 to the left
and M integer points to the right: x = j − M + 1, j − M + 2, ..., j + M. Having found such
a polynomial, we set φ(j + 1/2) = P (j)
m (j + 1/2). Note that for diﬀerent points x = j + 1/2,
polynomials P (j)
m are diﬀerent. To ﬁnd φ(j ±1/4), the same procedure is applied, but now the
values of φ at M half-integer points neighboring to x = j ±1/4 to the left and M half-integer
points to the right are used to construct the corresponding interpolating polynomial. For
example, for x = j + 1/4 the sequence will be: x = j − (M − 1)/2, j − (M − 2)/2, ..., j +
M/2. In other words, any x can be squeezed into successively smaller intervals of length
1/2, 1/4, ..., 1/2N , N → ∞. The limiting procedure allows one to compute φ(x) at any x,
in principle.

An important property of φ(x) is that it has compact support, an interval of width
D = 2m, that is, φ(x) = 0 for all |x| ≥ m as can be inferred from the construction procedure
described above.

In Fig. 1 we show an example of the scaling function φ(x) ≡ φ0,0(x) where φ0,0(x) is
the basis function centered at position x = 0 and corresponding to the zero resolution level
(the mesh mesh equals 1). The length of the ﬁlter is m = 15 so that support of the scaling
function is the interval −15 ≤ x ≤ 15.

2.2 Hamiltonian matrix

Consider ﬁrst a simple 1D example. Let H be a Hamiltonian of a system in the coordinate
representation. A solution of the Schr¨odinger equation i∂/∂t Ψ(x, t) = HΨ(x, t) for a given
initial wave packet Ψ(x, t = 0) is approximated by its projection into a ﬁnite dimensional
subspace spanned by φn,j where j enumerates basis functions whose support lies in a box, x ∈
[0, L], that is, Ψ(x, t) =
j sn,j(t)φn,t(x). Each basis function φn,j has support of the length
Dn = 2m/2n. Therefore the number of the basis functions N is given by: N = 2nL/2m.
Our choice of the basis implies also zero boundary conditions for the wave function. The
initial wave packet Ψ(x, t = 0) is projected into the corresponding subspace of Vn according
to (10) to determine sn,j(0). The Hamiltonian is projected by the rule H → PnHPn and
becomes a ﬁnite matrix with elements

P

H (n)

kj =

dx ˜φn,k(x)Hφn,j(x) .

Z

(14)

The Hamiltonian matrix acts in a vector space of the expansion coeﬃcient sn,j(t). Solving
the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation thus implies computing sn(t) = exp(−itH (n))sn(0),
where sn is regarded as a vector with components sn,j and H (n) as a matrix with elements
given in (14).

A typical Hamiltonian is a sum of kinetic and potential energies. For matrix elements of

the potential energy V we have

V (n)
kj =

dx ˜φn,j(x)V (x)φn,j(x) = V (2−nj)δkj .

(15)

Z

This is a great advantage of the basis under consideration: The potential energy matrix is
diagonal. To compute the kinetic energy matrix we apply a general procedure to compute
derivative operators dl/dx l in a basis of compactly supported (spline) wavelets [30]. By
rescaling the integration variable, and using Eqs. (7) and (12) one can ﬁnd

D(n,l)

k,j =

dx ˜φn,k(x)(d/dx )lφn,j(x) = 2nl

A(l)

ij = 2l+1h2i−j = 2lφ(i − j/2) .

Thus, D(l) is an eigenvector of the matrix A(l) corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.

Finally, we need a normalization of the vector D(l). Note that, since the value of φ at
any x is given by a polynomial of order m, the monomial xl, l ≤ m, should be a linear
j s0,jφ0,j(x) with s0,j = jl. Diﬀerentiating
combination of φ0,j(x) = φ(x − j), that is, xl =
this relation l times, multiplying by ˜φ(x) and integrating over x we obtain the normalization
relation

P

Xj

kj = (−1)lD(n,l)

The matrix D(n,l) satisﬁes the symmetry relation D(n,l)
, which follows from
(16) after changing the integration variable x → −x and making use of φ(x) = φ(−x) (the
same for the dual). In particular, D(n,2) is a symmetric matrix. Since support of φ(x) lies
within |x| ≤ m, the D(n,l) matrix is band diagonal: D(n,l)
k,j = 0, if |k − j| > m as follows from
Eq. (16). Therefore the action of the Hamiltonian of the system H (n) = − 1
2 D(n,2) + V (n) on
the wave function sn requires N ×2m elementary multiplications. The above approach allows
easy and fast evaluation of the Hamiltonian matrix for any desirable resolution level n (any
number of the basis functions) and any length of the ﬁlter m (any interpolating polynomial
order).

jk

A multidimensional generalization is obtained by taking the direct product of φn,j for
every independent variable xi. The resolution level ni may be chosen independently for
every variable xi. For example, in the two dimensional case, the basis consists of func-
tions φn1,j1(x1)φn2,j2(x2). The spline order m may also be chosen independently for every
coordinate. In other words, the scaling functions for each xi may be diﬀerent.

3 Numerical results

3.1 Harmonic oscillator example

d2
dx2 + x2

In Fig. 2 we show the results of a test calculation of 30 ﬁrst eigenvalues of a 1D harmonic
oscillator, H = − 1
2 . We use a mesh in the interval −L ≤ x ≤ L with L = 10 a0 where
2
a0 is the Bohr radius. The Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of interpolating scaling functions
φn,j(x) has been calculated according to the procedure described in the previous section
and diagonalized yielding the eigenstate energies. The results of the present approach are
compared with those obtained by the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) approach. In the FGH
method, the convergence is reached with 80 points of the grid and the error of the eigenvalue
calculation is basically determined by the precision of the diagonalization procedure. In the
ISF basis and low order m, convergence with the number of basis functions N (N = 2n × 2L,
where n is the resolution level) is slow. At the same time the convergence can dramatically
be improved by increasing the order m of the interpolating polynomial, i.e. by increasing the
band width of the band-diagonal kinetic energy matrix. This observation is in line with the
results reported by several authors for ﬁnite diﬀerences and ﬁnite elements where it has been
shown that the pseudospectral convergence can be reached by increasing the order of ﬁnite
diﬀerences or the order of an underlying polynomial in ﬁnite elements [1, 17, 18, 19, 25].
Thanks to the biorthogonality of the basis in our case, increasing the order m and the
resolution level n is a quite simple procedure given by Eqs.
(15)–(19) which is easy to
implement numerically.

In the case of the harmonic oscillator the FGH method outperforms the ISF method. The
latter, as well as ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, might compete with pseudospectral approaches
for calculations involving complex reaction paths. Indeed, the FGH method, for example,
generally uses hypercubic grid domains.
In the present approach the calculation volume
can suﬃciently be reduced by the choice of the basis functions φn,j whose support lies in the
vicinity of the reaction path, which is again a simple procedure because of the biorthogonality
of the basis. We now turn to one such example.

3.2 H+H2(v = 0) collinear collision

Here we present a wave packet propagation treatment of an H+H2 collision in collinear
geometry with the energy of the collisional Hydrogen atom between 0.2 eV and 1.1 eV . The
system is described by Jacobi coordinates r1,2 with r1 being the distance between the two
Hydrogen atoms in the molecule and r2 being the distance of the collisional Hydrogen atom
from the molecular center of mass. We use the Lanczos method [31, 32] to solve the time
dependent Schr¨odinger equation (atomic units are used)

where mH is the mass of the Hydrogen atom. The interaction potential V (r1, r2) is taken
from [33]. A typical size of the mesh is 32 × 32 a0. An absorbing potential [34, 35] is
introduced at the grid boundaries for large r1 and r2 to avoid interference of the simulated
wave packet with its reﬂection from the grid boundary. The initial state corresponds to the
H2 molecule in the v = 0 vibrational state and an impinging Gaussian wave packet in the
reaction channel (r2).

In the FGH method, convergent results are obtained with 192 points in the r1 coordinate
and 256 points in the r2 coordinate. Two types of calculation have been performed by
the ISF method. The ﬁrst one corresponds to a rectangular grid where the basis functions
are chosen as Φn,j1j2 = φn,j1(r1)φn,j2(r2). The resolution level n = 4 has been used, which
corresponds to the mesh step 1/24 = 0.0625 a0 so that in total there are 360 × 512 basis
functions. The order of the underlying interpolating polynomial (size of the ﬁlter) has been
set to m = 21. In the second simulation the ISF basis has been chosen in such a way that
the basis functions have support in the potential energy valley inside the 4.6 eV potential
energy level curve as shown in Fig. 3. In this case only 48600 basis functions are needed.
As a result, the computational time has been reduced by 3.8 times, which brings it to the
level comparable to the FGH treatment. Results are presented in Fig. 4. We ﬁnd that with
our choice of the basis both simulations based on the interpolating scaling functions yield
the total reaction probability R which nicely agrees with the FGH method. The absolute
diﬀerence

is better than 0.1%.

4 Conclusions

We have shown that the wave function representation in bases of interpolating scaling func-
tions can eﬃciently be used in wave packet propagation studies of molecular dynamics. The
ISF originate from a multiresolution analysis associated with interpolating (spline) wavelets
[27, 28, 29]. The ISF have a ﬁnite support whose width is determined by the order of the
underlying interpolating polynomial and the resolution level (the mesh step). The basis is
cardinal, which leads to a simple representation of the wave function. The resulting Hamil-
In particular, the potential energy matrix is diagonal, while for
tonian matrix is sparse.
the kinetic energy matrix there is an eﬃcient and simple algebraic procedure for its exact
computation so that the order of the underlying interpolating polynomial and the mesh step
can easily be varied to achieve fast convergence. Thus, our algorithm provides one with
ﬂexibility similar to that achieved in the case of ﬁnite diﬀerences of an arbitrary order by,
e.g., the Fornberg algorithm [7, 26]. In the 1D case the kinetic energy matrix has a band
diagonal structure with the width of the band of oﬀ-diagonal elements given by the size of
support of the scaling function. In our example of a collinear H+H2 collision, a considerable
reduction of computational costs has been reached when the basis functions are chosen in
such a way that their support is localized only in the vicinity of the reaction path. The very
possibility of the latter procedure and the simplicity of its numerical implementation, thanks

8

to the biorthogonality of the basis, is a general feature of the method proposed which can be
used in simulations of systems with more complex reaction paths to reduce computational
costs.

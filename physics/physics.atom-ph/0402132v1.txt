(Dated: February 20, 2014)

The comparison of diﬀerent atomic transition frequencies over time can be used to determine the
present value of the temporal derivative of the ﬁne structure constant α in a model-independent
way without assumptions on constancy or variability of other parameters. We have measured
an optical transition frequency at 688 THz in 171Yb+ with a cesium atomic clock at two times
separated by 2.8 years and ﬁnd a value for the fractional variation of the frequency ratio fYb/fCs
−1, consistent with zero. Combined with recently published values for
of (−1.2 ± 4.4) · 10
the constancy of other transition frequencies this measurement sets an upper limit on the present
−1, corresponding so far to the most stringent limit from
variability of α at the level of 2.0 · 10
laboratory experiments.

Motivation to search for a time- or space-dependence of
fundamental ‘constants’ has developed because theories
attempting to unify the fundamental interactions allow
or even imply variations of the coupling constants [1].
According to the inﬂationary model, dramatic changes
of particle properties took place in the early evolution of
the universe and it is conceivable that remnants of these
changes are still observable in later epochs. Variations of
the constants have been searched for in various contexts
[2, 3]. Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure constant α is presently
the most important test case. As a dimensionless quan-
tity, α ≃ 1/137 can be determined without reference to
a speciﬁc system of units. This point is important be-
cause the realization of the units themselves may also be
aﬀected by variations of the constants.

The only indication for a possible variation of a con-
stant so far comes from a shift of wavelengths of speciﬁc
absorption lines produced by interstellar clouds in the
light from distant quasars [4]. These observations seem
to suggest that about 1010 yr ago the value of α was
smaller than today by ∆α/α = (−0.54 ± 0.12) · 10−5 [5],
representing 4.7σ evidence for a varying α. Assuming a
linear increase in α with time, this would correspond to
a drift rate ∂ ln α/∂t = (6.4 ± 1.4) · 10−16 yr−1 [5]. More
recent measurements of quasar absorption lines are con-
sistent with ∆α = 0 [6]. A stringent limit on the order of
|∂ ln α/∂t| < 1 · 10−17 yr−1 for the temporal variability of
α has been deduced from the analysis of a natural nuclear
reactor that was active 2·109 years ago in the Oklo region
in West Africa [2, 7]. Since this analysis is based on the
energy of a neutron capture resonance, it is not possible
to separate the inﬂuence of a variable ﬁne structure con-
stant from possible variations of the coupling constants of
the strong interaction and of nuclear masses. In uniﬁed
theories the drift rates of these parameters are correlated

and it has been predicted that nuclear masses and mo-
ments may show signiﬁcantly higher relative drift rates
than α [8, 9, 10]. In this sense the limit on ∂ ln α/∂t from
the Oklo reactor has to be regarded as model-dependent
[11].

In this letter we report a model-independent limit for
the present temporal variation of α from comparisons of
atomic frequency standards that is only a factor of three
less stringent than the nonzero value observed by Webb
et al. [5] on a cosmological timescale, assuming a linear
time dependence. The short time intervals involved in
laboratory searches for temporal variations make these
less sensitive to long-term changes than the astrophysi-
cal or geophysical observations, but possible systematic
errors can be identiﬁed more easily. Precise frequency
comparisons have recently been performed in order to
constrain temporal derivatives of fundamental constants
[12, 13]. Since these measurements involve hyperﬁne fre-
quencies, they are sensitive not only to a variation of α,
but also to a variation of the nuclear magnetic moment.
In this case a limit on the variability of α could only be
obtained under the assumption that the nuclear proper-
ties stay constant, which is diﬃcult to justify.

To avoid the inﬂuence of nuclear structure and to ob-
tain a direct measure of the drift rate of α one can com-
pare optical electronic transition frequencies of diﬀerent
atoms. So far, suﬃciently accurate atomic optical fre-
quency standards have not been operated continuously
over extended periods of time, but a number of precise
frequency measurements have been performed with ref-
erence to cesium clocks. For the analysis, we assume that
the electronic transition frequency can be expressed as

f = Ry · C · F (α)

(1)
where Ry = mee4/(8ǫ2
0h3) ≃ 3.2898 · 1015 Hz is the Ry-
dberg constant in SI units of frequency, appearing here

as the common atomic scaling factor (me: electron mass;
e: elementary charge; ǫ0: electric constant; h: Planck’s
constant). C is a numerical constant which depends only
on the quantum numbers characterizing the atomic state
and is assumed not to vary in time. F (α) is a dimension-
less function of α that takes into account level shifts due
In many-electron atoms
to relativistic eﬀects [14, 15].
these eﬀects lead to diﬀerent sensitivities of the transi-
tion frequencies to a change of α, with the general trend
to ﬁnd a stronger dependence in heavier atoms, as was
ﬁrst pointed out in [16]. The relative temporal derivative
of the frequency f can be written as

∂ ln f
∂t

=

∂ ln Ry
∂t

+ A ·

∂ ln α
∂t

with A ≡

. (2)

∂ ln F
∂ ln α

The ﬁrst term ∂ ln Ry/∂t represents a variation that
would be common to all measurements of electronic tran-
sition frequencies: a change of the numerical value of the
Rydberg constant in SI units, i.e. with respect to the
133Cs hyperﬁne splitting. We distinguish here between
the numerical value of Ry and the physical parameter
which determines the atomic energy scale. A change of
the latter would not be detectable in this type of measure-
ment because the 133Cs hyperﬁne splitting is also propor-
tional to this quantity. Consequently, the detection of a
nonzero value of ∂ ln Ry/∂t would have to be interpreted
as being due to a change of the cesium hyperﬁne interval,
and in particular of the 133Cs nuclear magnetic moment.
The second term in Eq. 1 is speciﬁc to the atomic tran-
sition under study. The value of the sensitivity factor A
for small changes of α has been calculated for a number
[14, 15]. Assuming that pos-
of cases by Dzuba et al.
sible drifts of the atomic frequencies are linear in time
over the period of interest, the drift rate ∂ ln α/∂t can be
obtained from at least two measured drift rates of tran-
sition frequencies ∂ ln f /∂t if the sensitivity factors A for
the two transitions are diﬀerent. A plot of ∂ ln f /∂t as a
function of A should yield a straight line where the slope
is determined by ∂ ln α/∂t and a drift of Ry would show
up in the intercept [10].

Optical transition frequencies can be measured very
precisely in single trapped and laser-cooled ions [17] be-
cause here perturbations that may lead to systematic fre-
quency shifts can be controlled very eﬀectively. These
experiments are well suited for a laboratory search for
a variation of α because transitions in heavy ions like
Yb+ or Hg+ cover a wide range of A values [14, 15].
At PTB an optical frequency standard based on 171Yb+
is investigated [18, 19]. A single ytterbium ion is
trapped in a miniature Paul trap and is laser-cooled to a
sub-millikelvin temperature by exciting the 2S1/2(F =
1) → 2P1/2(F = 0) resonance transition at 370 nm.
Two additional lasers at wavelengths of 935 nm and
639 nm are used to repump the ion from the metastable
2D3/2(F = 1) and 2F7/2 levels that may be populated
during the cooling phase. The electric quadrupole tran-

transition, obtained with probe pulses of 90 ms duration and

sition 6s 2S1/2(F = 0) → 5d 2D3/2(F = 2) at 436 nm
wavelength (688 THz) with a natural linewidth of 3.1 Hz
serves as the reference transition. The isotope 171Yb
has a nuclear spin quantum number of 1/2 so that a
(F = 0, mF = 0) → (F = 2, mF = 0) component of the
reference transition with vanishing linear Zeeman shift is
available (Fig. 1a). The reference transition is probed
by the frequency-doubled radiation from a diode laser
emitting at 871 nm. The short-term frequency stability
of this laser is derived from a high-ﬁnesse, temperature-
stabilized and seismically isolated reference cavity. The
trapped ion is interrogated using the electron shelving
scheme [17] with alternating cooling and probe laser
pulses. A Fourier-limited linewidth of 10 Hz at 688 THz
and a resonant excitation probability of about 50% is ob-
tained (Fig. 1b). The probe laser frequency is stabilized
to the atomic reference frequency in a servo system with
a time constant of ≈ 10 s. We have observed a fractional
instability well below 1 · 10−15 for an averaging time of
1000 s. In order to minimise servo errors due to the drift
of the probe laser frequency (in the range of 0.2 Hz/s), a
second-order integrating algorithm is used.

The frequency of the 688 THz 171Yb+ standard was
measured relative to PTB’s primary cesium fountain
clock [20]. A hydrogen maser is referenced to the cesium
clock and delivers a signal at 100 MHz with an instability
below 2 · 10−15 in 1000 s of averaging. The link between
the maser signal and the optical frequency is established
with a femtosecond-laser frequency comb generator [21].
The result of a ﬁrst series of measurements starting in
December 2000 was 688 358 979 309 312 Hz with a total
1σ measurement uncertainty of 6 Hz, comprising 3.2 Hz
uncertainty due to systematic eﬀects of the Yb+ standard
[22].

The frequency was remeasured in November 2003. The
new value has the same total uncertainty (see below) and
is insigniﬁcantly lower by 2 Hz (see Fig. 2). From these

measurements we deduce a value for the fractional vari-
ation of fYb/fCs of (−1.2 ± 4.4) · 10−15 yr−1.

FIG. 2: Results of absolute frequency measurements of the
171Yb+ standard versus the date of the measurement (MJD:
Modiﬁed Julian Date).

The dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the
171Yb+ 688 THz optical frequency standard is the so-
called quadrupole shift, i.e., the shift of the atomic tran-
sition frequency due to the interaction of the electric
quadrupole moment of the D3/2 state with the gradient
of the static electric ﬁeld at the trap center. Such a ﬁeld
gradient may be produced by patch charges on the trap
electrodes. The quadrupole moment of the 2D3/2 state
0 in atomic units [19] and a gradient of 1 V/mm2
is 4ea2
may lead to a shift of up to 6 Hz.
It may be noted
that a ﬁeld gradient of this magnitude would lead to
easily detectable modiﬁcations of the oscillation frequen-
cies of the ion in the trap potential. Other systematic
frequency shifts are well below 1 Hz and their contri-
bution to the uncertainty is negligible at present: The
static magnetic ﬁeld in the trap is typically 0.1 mT dur-
ing the cooling phase and 1 µT during the interrogation
of the 2S1/2(F = 0) → 2D3/2(F = 2) reference transi-
tion, leading to a quadratic Zeeman shift of 0.06 Hz. The
quadratic Stark shift due to blackbody radiation emitted
from the trap electrodes at room temperature is calcu-
lated as −0.4 Hz. In the absence of a full evaluation, we
use an estimate of 3.2 Hz for the systematic uncertainty
of the 171Yb+ frequency standard. We believe that this
does not signiﬁcantly underestimate the uncertainty be-
cause frequency comparisons between two Yb+ ions in
two separate traps showed agreement at the sub-Hertz
level [19].

To obtain the limit on ∂ ln α/∂t we combine the data
from 171Yb+ with a published limit on the drift rate
of a transition frequency in 199Hg+ [13]. The mercury
ion is investigated as an optical frequency standard at
NIST (Boulder, USA). The transition 5d106s 2S1/2 →
5d96s2 2D5/2 at 282 nm (1065 THz) serves as the ref-
erence. A ﬁrst frequency measurement of this transi-
tion was published in 2001 with a relative uncertainty of

3

9 · 10−15 [23]. A sequence of measurements over a period
of two years has resulted in a constraint on the fractional
variation of fHg/fCs at the level of 7 · 10−15 yr−1 [13].

The sensitivities of the ytterbium and mercury transi-
tion frequencies to changes of α are quite diﬀerent [24]:
AYb = 0.88 [15] and AHg = −3.19 [14]. Since the un-
certainties of these numbers are not given explicitly, we
treat them as being exact, noting that changes within
10% would modify our results only marginally. Combin-
ing the two measurements in a search for a temporal vari-
ability of α is well justiﬁed: The time spans covered by
the frequency measurements have a signiﬁcant temporal
overlap. The cesium fountains of both laboratories have
been compared repeatedly during the relevant period and
found to be in agreement to within their evaluated un-
certainties of 1.0 · 10−15 [20].

A further precision test for the constancy of an optical
transition frequency was recently presented by Fischer
et al. who measured the 1S → 2S transition frequency
in atomic hydrogen in two periods around MJD 51360
and MJD 52680, using a transportable cesium fountain
frequency standard [25]. The limit on the fractional drift
rate for the hydrogen frequency that is deduced from
these experiments is (−3.2 ± 6.4) · 10−15 yr−1 [25] with
AH being zero.

The three limits on the frequency drift rates are con-
sistent with a linear dependence on A, as assumed in Eq.
2 (see Fig. 3a). From a weighted linear regression we
obtain from the slope of the ﬁt:

∂ ln α
∂t

= (−0.3 ± 2.0) · 10

−15 yr

−1

(3)

for the present value of the temporal derivative of the
ﬁne structure constant at the conﬁdence level of 1σ.
Since the publication [25] may be regarded as prelimi-
nary, we also determined the slope based only on the two
data points from the single-ion experiments with Hg+
and Yb+ and ﬁnd only a marginal change of the result:
∂ ln α/∂t = (−0.2 ± 2.0) · 10−15 yr−1. This limit is the
result of a model-independent analysis that is not based
on assumptions about correlations between drift rates of
diﬀerent quantities and does not postulate the drift rate
of any quantity to be zero. To our knowledge, this is so
far the most stringent limit on ∂ ln α/∂t obtained from
laboratory experiments. Another recent related analysis
based on the data from hydrogen and mercury is pre-
sented in [25].

The intercept of the ﬁtted straight line with the line
A = 0 in Fig. 3a can be used to determine the drift rate
of the numerical value of the Rydberg frequency Ry. This
quantity is of great metrological importance. A nonzero
value would imply among other consequences that a time
scale generated with a cesium clock would not be uniform
with respect to other atomic oscillations. The result that

4

improvements can be expected since trapped ions have
the potential to reach relative uncertainties in the range
of 10−18 for the comparison of optical transition frequen-
cies.

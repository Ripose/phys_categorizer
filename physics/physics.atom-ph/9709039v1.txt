The Hilbert-Schmidt Theorem Formulation of the R-Matrix
Theory

Abstract

Using the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem, we reformulate the R-matrix theory
in terms of a uniformly and absolutely convergent expansion. Term by term
diﬀerentiation is possible with this expansion in the neighborhood of the
surface. Methods for improving the convergence are discussed when the R-
function series is truncated for practical applications.

I. Introduction

Since 1947, boundary condition methods (BCM) have played an impor-
tant role for many quantum mechanical problems [1-37]. In the BCM formu-
lation, conﬁguration space is divided into two parts:
internal and external
regions. In the external region, the interaction is usually known and in many
cases the eﬀective two-body equation is exactly solvable. A boundary con-
dition matrix is deﬁned in terms of the independent external wave functions
and their derivates at a boundary. From this information (boundary con-
dition matrix) and the known solution in the external region, the S-matrix
and the cross-section can be calculated. There are two boundary condition
matrices: R matrix and P matrix. The R-matrix, which is the inverse of the
logarithmic derivative of the external channel wave function at the surface,
was ﬁrst introduced by Wigner and Eisenbud in 1947 [1]. A detailed account
of the R-matrix theory of nuclear reactions is given in [3]. The P-matrix is the
inverse of the R-matrix. The P-matrix formulation of nuclear reactions has
not been used extensively except for the nucleon-nucleon scattering problem
[5-10].

The R-matrix theory is extensively employed for describing energy de-
pendence of the cross-section for various binary nuclear processes including
both elementary and composite nuclear particles [3, 11-17] and is often used
to extrapolate experimental data for the cross-section which are dominated
by the contributions from a few resonance or bound states.

In atomic physics, the exchange interaction, which is the most diﬃcult
part of the problem to calculate accurately, is only in the internal region,
and interactions in the external region reduce to long range local poten-
tials [18]. The R-matrix code is a very powerful computation code [19, 20]
for calculating electron-atom collisions and photoabsorption processes. For
example, the inner-shell photoionization cross-sections calculated by the R-
matrix code [21, 22] are in excellent agreement with the recent experimental
measurements [38].

The R-matrix method for studying low-energy electron-molecule collisions
was developed in [23-25].
It has been used to describe elastic scattering,
electronic excitation, vibrational excitation [27] and dissociative attachment
[29].

The R-matrix method is based upon expanding the total wave function
Ψ for any energy in the internal region in terms of the complete set of eigen-
function Xλ of that region,

Xλ
where Xλ are deﬁned by the equation

Ψ =

AλXλ,

HXλ = EλXλ,

(1)

(2)

and satisfy certain R-matrix boundary conditions on the surface [3]. It is
known that there is a formal problem with the wave function expansion used
in the conventional approach for the R-matrix theory. Either the expansion
given by Eq.
(1) is not uniformly convergent in the neighborhood of the
surface, or term-by-term diﬀerentiation of the expansion is not admissible
[3,18]. To avoid these diﬃculties variational formalisms [30-36] were proposed
with basis functions which do not satisfy the R-matrix boundary conditions.

The R-matrix theory is rigorous and therefore, there remains, from the
formal point of view, a problem of how to formulate the R-matrix method in
terms of a uniformly and absolutely convergent expansion.

In this paper we present solutions of this formal problem and discuss
various approximations of the R-function. In Section II, we describe in some
detail the conventional formulation of R-function in terms of the expansion
given by Eq. (1) and (2). In Section III, we reformulate the R-matrix theory
based on the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem to obtain the R-function in terms of

2

a series which is uniformly and absolutely convergent.
In Section IV, we
discuss methods of improving the convergence of the R-function series when
it is truncated for practical applications. A summary and conclusions are
given in Section V.

II. R-function

In order to describe the formal procedure employed in the R-matrix the-
ory, we consider the simplest case of potential scattering for spinless particles
with only the elastic scattering channel being open.

The radial wave function uℓ(r) in the interior region 0 ≤ r ≤ a satisﬁes

the Schr¨odinger equation

(3)

where µ is the reduced mass, V (r) is the interaction potential in the internal
region 0 ≤ r ≤ a, and k2 = 2µE/¯h2.

In the conventional theory [3, 18, 37], uℓ(r) in the internal region (0 ≤
λ(r) given within the

r ≤ a) is expanded in terms of complete set of states uℓ
region 0 ≤ r ≤ a. These states are the solutions of the equation

As we show below, either (i) the expansion (7) does not converge uni-
formly, or (ii) term-by-term diﬀerentiation is not admissible [3, 18], or both
(i) and (ii) may be applicable. From Green’s theorem [3, 18] and the bound-
ary conditions (5), we ﬁnd

Gℓ(r, r′). This bilinear series, Eq. (14a), converges in L2(0 < r < a).

(15)

We note that the completeness of the states uℓ

λ does not guarantee validity
of Eq. (12). To demonstrate this statement, let us ﬁrst consider a special
case of boundary conditions B = ∞, or

In this case, we can ﬁnd from Eq. (9) that

and substitution of Eq. (17) into Eq. (7) gives

If one tries to obtain this value of lim

= 1 from the right side of Eq.

(18) taking the limit term by term, one obtains a null result, because of Eq.
(16).

Once again we obtain a null result for η(a) = 1 by diﬀerentiating term by
term and taking the limit term by term of the sum in Eq. (19) and using Eq.
(5). The explanation for these paradoxes is that either (i) the expansion (7)

and

or (ii) its derivative series, obtained by diﬀerentiating the individual terms
of the expansion (7), is not uniformly convergent in the neighborhood of the
surface. Or they may be due to both (i) and (ii). This diﬃculty associated
with the expansion (7) has been known for many years [3,18].

III. The Hilbert-Schmidt theorem formulation of the R-matrix the-
ory.

Let us rewrite Eq. (3) in an integral form

Kℓ(r, r′) = −

following equation

constant satisfying a condition

The integral equation (21), which is not the Lippmann-Schwinger type equa-
tion, was ﬁrst introduced in [9] for the κ2 = 0, B = ∞ case. Eq. (21) has a
unique solution, since

i.e. Kℓ(r, r′) is completely continuous and self-adjoint kernel [39]. Let γλ(λ =

(27a)

(27b)

As it is well known, the eigenvalues γλ are real, and the functions uℓ(r) and
uℓ
λ(r) are continuous. Due to the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem [39], the following
expansion

converges uniformly and absolutely over 0 ≤ r ≤ a, and, if k2 6= k2
λ, the
unique solution uℓ(r) of the integral equation (21) appears in the following
form of a series which is uniformly and absolutely convergent over 0 ≤ r ≤ a
(by Schmidt’s formula):

where

˜Xℓ(a)

R(B)(κ2) =

we ﬁnd that R(B)(k2) relates the amplitudes uℓ to its derivative on the bound-
ary by the relation (13). Because the series (29) converges uniformly and
absolutely, the following equation

(32)

is valid [40], and hence the expansion (29) is free of diﬃculties encountered in
the expansions given by Eqs. (7) and (10). Series (30) can be also obtained
from the dispersion formula (11) by separating the energy independent term
R(B)(κ2) in the R-function, Eq. (11), with κ2 satisfying condition (25). Our
derivation has shown that the dispersion expansion (30) converges absolutely,
and exhibits the general energy-dependence of the R-function. The expansion
given by Eq. (29) is a main result of this paper. The proof of the absolute
convergence of the series (30) in case κ2 = 0 was given by M. Schiﬀer and V.
Bargmann. Their proof is reproduced in [41].

IV. Improving the Convergence

In general, the R-function has an inﬁnite number of pole terms. According
to Courant’s minimax considerations, if V (r) is bounded, no k2
λ diﬀers from
λ, (k(0)
the corresponding value of k2
λ )2, for noninteracting case (V (r) = 0) by
more than the bound [3]. Consequently, the general term of the series (11)
for ﬁxed k2 behaves as 1/λ2 since (k(0)
λ )2 ∝ λ2, while the general term of the
series (30) behaves as 1/λ4 as λ → ∞. For the case of the dispersion formula
(11), truncation of the R-function by a ﬁnite number (N) of terms gives

While for the case of the dispersion formula (30), we have

(35)

where

The general method of improving the convergence is to separate and sum
the slowly converging parts of the series [42]. It is obvious that there are many
possibilities to obtain a rapid convergence. For example, the expansion (30)
can be represented in the form

R(B)(k2) = R(B)(κ2) +

(R(B)(k2

0) − R(B)(κ2))

where k2

Expansion (36) converges much faster than (30) (general term behaves as
1/λ6), and truncation of Eq. (36) by a ﬁnite number of terms gives

However, for the case of Eq. (37), we have introduced an additional param-
eter R(N )
(37) on this

parameter R(N )

, and we do not expect a weak dependence of Eq.

.

1

To obtain a faster convergence, we introduce a trial potential ˜V (r) and

remove the corresponding R-function ˜R(B)(k2) obtained with ˜V (r):

˜R(B)(k2) = ˜R(B)(κ2) +

For the case of the dispersion formula (11), this method has been used in

many papers [11, 15, 18]. For the case of Eq. (30), we have

(41)
It can be shown (see Appendix) that the general term of Eq. (41) behaves
as 1/λ6 for any bound ˜V (r), and hence we expect a weak ˜V (r) dependence
for the following approximation

λ(r) are solutions of Eq. (4) with the trial potential ˜V (r). Note that

of the R-matrix with the approximation (42) for an incident nucleon, it is
possible to use a simple squared-well potential

˜V (r) = −V0θ(a − r),

where V0 = ¯h2K 2

V. Summary and Conclusions

Using the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem and the integral equation, Eq. (21),
we have reformulated the R-function theory in terms of the expansion given
by Eq. (29) which is uniformly and absolutely convergent for all values of
0 ≤ r ≤ a. This expansion, Eq. (29), can be diﬀerentiated term by term
in the neighborhood of the surface. Our reformulation solves the existing
formal problem of how to formulate the R-matrix theory without the use

10

of expansions which are not uniformly convergent. A possible method for
improving the convergence of the R-function series is given when the series
is truncated for practical applications.

(A.5)

converges uniformly and absolutely over 0 ≤ r ≤ a [39], where ˜K p is a
product of the operators ˜K and the function ˜K(r, r′) is the kernel of the
linear integral operator ˜K.

lim

λ(a) = φℓ

(A.6)

and hence the general term of Eq. (41) behaves as 1/λ6 for any bound and
continuous V (r) and ˜V (r).

We note an important fact that we do not need “smallness” of V(r) for the
convergence of the Neumann series, Eq. (A.5), in contrast to the conventional
perturbation expansion.

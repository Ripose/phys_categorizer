The complete gauge-invariant set of the one-loop QED corrections to the parity-nonconserving 6s-7s ampli-
tude in 133Cs is evaluated to all orders in αZ using a local version of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock potential. The
calculations are peformed in both length and velocity gauges for the absorbed photon. The total binding QED
correction is found to be -0.27(3)%, which differs from previous evaluations of this effect. The weak charge of
133Cs, derived using two most accurate values of the vector transition polarizability β, is QW = −72.57(46)
B and QW = −73.09(54) for β = 27.15(11)a3
for β = 26.957(51)a3
B. The ﬁrst value deviates by 1.1σ from
the prediction of the Standard Model, while the second one is in perfect agreement with it.

Investigations of parity noncoservation (PNC) effects in
atomic systems play a prominent role in tests of the Stan-
dard Model (SM) and impose constraints on physics beyond it
[1, 2]. The 6s-7s PNC amplitude in 133Cs [3] remains one of
the most attractive subject for such investigations. The mea-
surement of this amplitude to a 0.3% accuracy [4, 5] has stim-
ulated a reanalysis of related theoretical contributions. First,
it was found [6, 7, 8, 9] that the role of the Breit interaction
had been underestimated in previous evaluations of this effect
[10, 11]. Then, it was pointed out [12] that the QED cor-
rections may be comparable with the Breit corrections. The
numerical evaluation of the vacuum-polarization (VP) correc-
tion [13] led to a 0.4% increase of the 6s-7s PNC amplitude in
133Cs, which resulted in a 2.2σ deviation of the weak charge
of 133Cs from the SM prediction. This has triggered a great
interest to calculations of the one-loop QED corrections to the
PNC amplitude.

While the VP contribution can easily be evaluated to a high
accuracy within the Uehling approximation, the calculation of
the self-energy (SE) contribution is a much more demanding
problem (here and below we imply that the SE term embraces
all one-loop vertex diagrams as well). To zeroth order in αZ,
it was derived in Refs. [14, 15]. This correction, whose rel-
α/(2π), is commonly included in the
ative value equals to
deﬁnition of the nuclear weak charge. The αZ-dependent part
of the SE correction to the PNC matrix element between s
and p states was evaluated in Refs. [16, 17]. These calcula-
tions, which are exact to ﬁrst order in αZ and partially include
higher-order binding effects, yield the correction of -0.9(1)%
[16, 18] and -0.85% [17]. This restored the agreement with
SM.

−

Despite of the close agreement of the results obtained in
Refs. [17, 18], the status of the QED correction to PNC in
133Cs cannot be considered as resolved until a complete αZ-
dependence calculation of the SE correction to the 6s-7s tran-
sition amplitude is accomplished. The reasons for that are the
following. First, in case of cesium (Z = 55) the parameter
0.4 is not small and, therefore, the higher-order cor-
αZ
rections can be signiﬁcant. Second, because the calculations
[16, 17, 18] are performed for the PNC matrix element only,

≈

they do not include other SE diagrams which contribute to the
6s-7s transition amplitude. For instance, these calculations do
not account for diagrams in which the virtual photon embraces
both the weak interaction and the absorbed photon. Our calcu-
lations, however, show that the contributions of all diagrams
are of the same order of magnitude (in both length and ve-
locity gauges, see below), and the ﬁnal result arises through a
delicate cancellation of individual terms, none of which can be
neglected. Third, strictly speaking, the PNC matrix element
between the states of different energies is not gauge invariant.
Despite the gauge-dependent part is suppressed by the small
energy difference [17], estimates of the uncertainty in the def-
inition of the PNC diagrams may fail due to unphysical origin
of the gauge-dependent terms.

The ﬁrst step towards a complete αZ-dependence calcula-
tion was done in Ref. [19], where the SE correction to the 2s-
2p1/2 PNC transition in H-like ions was evaluated. This tran-
sition was chosen to deal with the simpliﬁed gauge-invariant
amplitude. The results of that work agree with those of Refs.
[16, 17, 18]. However, as was stressed there, no claims can be
made about the applicability of these results to the 6s-7s PNC
transition in neutral cesium. In this Letter we calculate the
whole gauge-invariant set of the one-loop QED corrections to
the 6s-7s PNC transition amplitude in 133Cs and compare the
obtained result with the previous treatments.

A systematic derivation of the QED corrections in a fully
relativistic approach requires the use of perturbation theory
starting with a one-electron approximation in an effective lo-
cal potential V (r). In neutral atoms, it is natural to assume
that V (r) includes not only the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus
but also a part of the electron-electron interaction. The in-
teraction of the electrons with the quantized electromagnetic
ﬁeld and the correlation effects are accounted for by perturba-
tion theory. In this way we obtain quantum electrodynamics
in the Furry picture.

To derive formal expressions for the transition amplitude
we employ the method developed in Ref. [20] and described
in detail in Ref. [21]. Since the wave length of the absorbed
photon is much larger than the atomic size, one can use the
dipole approximation. Within this approximation, calcula-

tions in the velocity gauge are performed using formulas given
in Ref. [21] with the replacement exp (ik
1 in the pho-
ton wave function. The corresponding formulas in the length
gauge are easily obtained by replacing α with r in all vertices
corresponding to the photon absorbtion and by multiplying the
Ea), where Ea and Eb are
amplitude with the factor i(Eb −
the total energies of the atom in the initial (6s) and ﬁnal (7s)
states, respectively. This simple rule can be derived using Eq.
(205) of Ref. [21] and the equal-time commutation relations.

which results from the expansion of the factor 1/(Eb −
Formulas (2)-(15) contain ultraviolet and infrared diver-
gences. To cancel the ultraviolet divergences, we expand
contributions (2)-(7) into zero-, one-, and many-potential
terms and contributions (8)-(11) into zero- and many-potential
terms. The ultraviolet divergencies are present only in the
zero- and one-potential terms. They are removed analytically
by calculating these terms in the momentum space (for details,
we refer to Refs. [22, 23, 24]). The many-potential terms are
evaluated in conﬁguration space. The infrared divergences,
which occur in contributions (2)-(5) and (12)-(13), are regu-
larized by introducing a nonzero photon mass and cancelled
analytically.

Since the levels 6s, 6p1/2, 7s, and 7p1/2 are very close to
each other, to get reliable results for the transition amplitude
under consideration, one needs to use a local potential V (r)
that reproduces energies and wave functions of these states to
a sufﬁcient accuracy. We construct such a potential by invert-
ing the radial Dirac equation with the radial wave function
obtained by solving the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) equation
with the code of Ref. [25]. Details of this procedure will be
published elsewhere. In Table 1, we compare the energies ob-
tained with the local potential V (r), that was derived using
mainly the DHF wave function of the 6s state, with the DHF
energies and with the experimental ones.

Numerical evaluation of expressions (1)-(15) was per-
formed by employing the dual-kinetic-balance ﬁnite basis set
method [26] with basis functions construced from B-splines.
The calculation of the zeroth-order contribution, with V (r)
constructed as indicated above, yields EPNC =-1.002, in units

PNC contains also the free term,

that includes the correlation effects, -0.908 [10]. The results
for the SE corrections are presented in Table 2. Since there is a
signiﬁcant cancellation between terms containing the infrared
singularities, the terms corresponding to n = a in Σ′(εa)
and n = b in Σ′(εa) are subtracted from contributions (2)-
(5) and added to contributions (12)-(13). The total SE cor-
rection δEtot

mentioned above. Since this term is usually included into the
weak charge QW , one has to consider the binding SE correc-
tion deﬁned as δEbind
PNC + α/(2π)EPNC. Accord-
ing to Table 2, the binding SE correction amounts to -0.67%.
To estimate the uncertainty of this value due to correlation
effects, we have also performed the calculations with V (r)
constructed employng the DHF wave function of the 7s state.
While this leads to a 2% decrease of the transition amplitude,
the relative shift of the SE correction is ﬁve times smaller.
Since the correlation effects contribute to the transition am-
plitude on the 20% level, we assume a 4% uncertainty for the
total SE correction. Therefore, our value for the binding SE
correction is -0.67(3)%. This value differs from the previous
evaluations of the SE effect, -0.9(1)% [18] and -0.85% [17].

PNC = δEtot

We have also calculated the VP correction. Our value for
the Uehling part amounts to 0.410%, which agrees well with
the previous calculations of this effect. We have found that
including the screening into the Uehling potential does not
affect this value. As to the Wichmann-Kroll (WK) correction,
our calculation employing approximate formulas for the WK
potential from Ref. [27] yields -0.004% (cf. [9]). This leads
to the 0.406% result for the total VP correction. Therefore,
the total binding QED correction amounts to -0.27(3)%.

±

To get the total 6s-7s PNC transition amplitude in 133Cs,
we combine the value that includes the correlation effects
[7, 9, 10, 11], -0.908(1)
0.5%, with the -0.61% Breit correc-
tion [9], the -0.27(3)% binding QED correction, the -0.19(6)%
neutron skin correction [28], the -0.08% correction due to the
renormalization of QW from the atomic momentum transfer
30 MeV down to q = 0 [17], and the 0.04% contribution
q
from the electron-electron weak interaction [17]. Using the
experimental value for the EPNC/β [4], where β is the vec-
tor transition polarizabilty, we obtain for the weak charge of
133Cs:

value deviates from the SM prediction of -73.09(3) [31] by

In summary, we have calculated the QED correction to the
6s-7s PNC transition amplitude in 133Cs and derived the weak
charge using two most accurate values of the vector transi-
tion polarizability. Further improvement of atomic tests of
the Standard Model can be achieved, from theoretical side, by
more accurate calculations of the electron-correlation effects

of the PNC amplitude in cesium or other atomic systems. Par-
ticularly interesting is the francium atom, where PNC effects
are greatly enhanced by strong electric ﬁeld of the nucleus.
Precise measurements of the PNC amplitude in Fr are becom-
ing feasible due to recent advances in producing, storing, and
cooling of short-lived radioactive isotopes.

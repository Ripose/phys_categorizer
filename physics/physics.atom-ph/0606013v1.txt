Abstract

Universal low-energy properties are studied for three identical bosons conﬁned in two dimensions.

The short-range pair-wise interaction in the low-energy limit is described by means of the boundary

condition model. The wave function is expanded in a set of eigenfunctions on the hypersphere and

the system of hyper-radial equations is used to obtain analytical and numerical results. Within

the framework of this method, exact analytical expressions are derived for the eigenpotentials

and the coupling terms of hyper-radial equations. The derivation of the coupling terms is generally

applicable to a variety of three-body problems provided the interaction is described by the boundary

condition model. The asymptotic form of the total wave function at a small and a large hyper-radius

ρ is studied and the universal logarithmic dependence

point is derived. Precise three-body binding energies and the 2 + 1 scattering length are calculated.

INTRODUCTION

Dynamics of few particles conﬁned in two dimensions (2D) is of interest in connection

with numerous investigations ranging from ultra-cold gases [1, 2, 3, 4] to atoms absorbed

on a surface [5, 6, 7]. An additional motivation is roused by speciﬁc features of quantum

systems in 2D [8, 9, 10]. The experiments with ultra-cold gases in the 2D and quasi-2D

traps have been recently realized [1, 2].

The description of elementary processes in ultra-cold gases has been attracting great

interest in the last years and many aspects of the low-energy few-body dynamics in three

dimensions (3D) have been thoroughly investigated. As a particular important example, one

could mention the studies of the three-body recombination for spinless bosons [11, 12, 13, 14],

two-component fermions [15], and particles with internal degrees of freedom in the presence

of a Feshbach resonance [16, 17]. Low-energy few-body dynamics in low dimensions is

less investigated despite the extensive studies. Besides, new phenomena and additional

complications arise in quasi-low-dimensional geometry if the eﬀect of motion in the transverse

directions is taken into account (see, e. g., [3, 18, 19, 20, 21]). Among diﬀerent aspects of

2D systems, one should mention treatment of the three-body energy spectra [22, 23, 24],

low-energy scattering of an atom oﬀ a dimer molecule [25], and low-energy three-to-three

scattering [26, 27]. The precise binding energy of four bosons was calculated in [28] and the

universal law for the N-boson ground-state energy was discussed in [29].

Concerning other 2D and quasi-2D problems, considerable eﬀorts have long been devoted

to investigation of atoms adsorbed on a surface, including helium atoms on graphite [30] and

hydrogen atoms on a helium ﬁlm [5, 6, 7]. In this respect, one should mention observation

of a quasi-condensate [6], measurement of the three-body recombination rate [7] and a vast

number of theoretical papers, e. g., [10, 31, 32].

In the low-energy limit, which is of interest both for practical applications and from

the general point of view, the description of the few-body system becomes universal, i. e.,

essentially independent of the details of the two-body interactions. Among diﬀerent results

of this sort, notice the recent analytical derivation of the universal constants for the zero-

energy three-boson scattering in 3D [14, 33]. The description becomes parameterless if only

the parameter describing the two-body interactions, e. g., the two-body scattering length a,

is chosen as a scale [34, 35, 36]. In comparison with the universal description in 3D, it is

2

of importance that the solutions of the three-body problem in 2D , contrary to the 3D one,

remain regular near the triple-collision point even in the zero-range-interaction limit. This

regularity implies, inter alia, absence of the Thomas and Eﬁmov eﬀect, which was noticed

in [8, 9]. Thus, there is no additional regularization parameter, which was introduced in 3D,

and the three-body properties in 2D are completely determined by the two-body input that

provides a completely universal and parameterless description in the low-energy limit. In

particular, the trimer binding energies and the 2 + 1 scattering length become the universal

constants, which must be determined with a good accuracy.

The universal limit corresponds to the limit of the vanishing interaction range r0 so that

r0 must be much smaller than any length scale in the system, i. e., the binding energies do

not exceed the characteristic energy

. Practically, the universal limit can be realized by

¯h2
mr2
0

adjusting the parameters of interaction to diminish the two-body binding energy, e. g., by

tuning the position of the Feshbach resonance. To approach the universal limit, one could

use the dependence on the particle mass, e. g., an interesting way is to study the isotopic

eﬀect for 2D helium atoms [22]. Generally, the universal limit in 2D appears for a very

weak potential with a non-positive average as it is known that in this case the two-body

binding energy in 2D becomes exponentially small with decreasing potential strength [37].

It is worthwhile to mention a qualitative diﬀerence of the universal properties in 2D and 3D,

namely, one expects that the both three-body bound states arise simultaneously with the

two-body bound state, i. e., at the inﬁnite two-body scattering length. This conjecture is

supported by the calculations [22, 38], which considered the dependence of the three-body

binding energy on the particle mass and potential strength in the limit of the vanishing

two-body binding energy. Recall that in 3D an inﬁnite number of three-body bound states

arise with increasing potential strength at ﬁnite values of the scattering length before the

two-body bound state arises.

In the present paper, universal properties of three identical 2D bosons are studied within

the framework of the method which makes use of the boundary condition model (BCM) [9,

39] for the s-wave inter-particle interactions. The wave function is expanded in a set of

eigenfunctions on the hypersphere and a resulting system of hyper-radial equations (HREs)

is used to conveniently treat both the boundary and scattering problem. One of the principal

advantages is that for the two-body interaction given by the BCM the eigenpotentials of

HREs are solutions of a simple eigenvalue equation. In addition, the aim of the present paper

3

is to derive all the terms of HREs in the analytical form, thus determining the coupling terms

via the eigenpotentials and their derivatives over the hyper-radius. Both the derivation and

the expressions found are generally applicable to a variety of problems; as a matter of fact,

one can obtain the coupling terms in the analytical form for three particles of arbitrary

permutation symmetry, with arbitrary masses and scattering lengths, and independently

of the conﬁguration-space dimension. In particular, analytical expressions for the coupling

terms of the same form as in the present paper were derived for three identical bosons in

three dimensions [35]. The exact expressions are used to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of

the coeﬃcients of HREs, their solutions, and the total wave function both for large and small

inter-particle separation. As an important example, the universal dependence of the total

wave function in the vicinity of the triple-collision point is found. In addition, the explicitly

known dependence on the channel number is helpful to study the role of the channel coupling

and to estimate convergence of the results with increasing number of HREs.

Until now, the numerical calculations of the universal constants have included the early

calculation [8] of the binding energies of three 2D bosons by solving the momentum-space

integral equations. Much better precision was obtained by solution of the hyper-radial

equations [23, 40], which results were not in complete agreement with those of [8]. Up to

date, in the universal limit of zero-range interactions the most precise binding energies have

been found by solving the momentum-space integral equations [29]. Among scarce studies

of the low-energy three-body scattering in 2D, the only available calculation in Ref. [25]

demonstrated smooth dependence of the 2 + 1 scattering length on the interaction range. In

the present paper, the precise universal values of the three-body binding energies and the

scattering length for a particle collision oﬀ a bound pair are calculated.

It has been known for a long time (see, e. g., [41, 42]) that the one-dimensional problem

of N identical particles with the zero-range interactions (in this case, Dirac’s δ-function) is

exactly soluble. On the other hand, the method of the present paper, including the derivation

of the exact expressions for the coeﬃcients of HREs, is equally applicable to the three-body

problem in 1D. Note that the approach based on solution of HREs was used in Ref. [43] to

discuss low-energy 2 + 1 scattering in 1D. The calculation of the 1D three-body problem

provides a good opportunity to test the approach, to check the numerical procedure, and

to compare the 1D and 2D calculations. For these reasons, the main discussion of the 2D

three-body problem is complemented by a brief treatment of the corresponding 1D problem.

4

The paper is organized in the following manner. The next section contains the informa-

tion on the low-energy two-body scattering in 2D, introduces the boundary condition model,

and describes the expansion of the wave function in a set of eigenfunctions on the hyper-

sphere. Analytical results are collected in Section III, starting with the eigenvalue equation

which determines the eigenpotentials for HREs. Furthermore, analytical expressions for the

coupling terms in HREs are derived. On the ground of these results, the asymptotic form

of the eigenpotentials and coupling terms is obtained and applied to derive implications on

the asymptotic behaviour of the solution of HREs. The numerical procedure and the results

of the numerical calculations are described in Section IV, and the last section contains a

summary and a ﬁnal conclusion. The results for three identical bosons in 1D are brieﬂy

discussed in Appendix.

II. METHOD

The present study is aimed at the description of the low-energy properties of three iden-

tical 2D bosons with the short-range pair-wise interaction in the limit of the zero interaction

range. The description turns out to be universal, i. e., essentially independent of the details

of the two-body interaction. In the low-energy limit under consideration, only the zero total

angular momentum L = 0 should be considered and only the s-wave two-body interaction

should be taken into account. The two-body input for the three-body problem is set as

the universal low-energy description of the two-body interaction by a single parameter, for

which the two-body scattering length a can be suitably chosen. The scattering length in 2D

is deﬁned by the asymptotic form of the zero-energy wave function at large inter-particle

separation r beyond the interaction range, Ψ

a [9, 10]. This is in analogy with the
deﬁnition of the scattering length in 3D as the distance at which the asymptotic expres-

A. Boundary condition model

In the low-energy limit under consideration, a convenient one-parameter description of

the two-body interactions is obtained within the framework of the BCM if the interaction

range is allowed to shrink to zero. The two-body interaction introduced in this way is

known as the zero-range potential [46] and the Fermi pseudo-potential [39]. The equivalent

approach is also used in the momentum-space representation [29, 36]. Within the framework

of the BCM corresponding to the vanishing interaction range, the exact scattering amplitude

f0(k) is determined by the low-energy expression (1)for an arbitrary k and the two-body

binding energy equals

2γ, which corresponds to the pure imaginary pole of f0(k) at
γ. Explicitly, the s-wave boundary condition which provides the above-discussed

The total interaction of three particles is a sum of two-body potentials, which are replaced

in the BCM by the two-body boundary condition of the form (2) for each pair of particles.

As the only parameter describing the two-body interactions is the scattering length a, the

units ¯h = m = a = 1 will be used throughout the paper, thereby the three-body problem

becomes parameterless. The total wave function Ψ satisﬁes the boundary conditions and

the Helmholtz equation,

B. Hyper-radial expansion

Solution of a system of HREs provides an eﬃcient approach to treat both the eigenvalue

and scattering problem for the three-body system [23, 35]. This approach is particularly

advantageous due to the use of the BCM since all the terms of HREs are expressed in

the analytical form, which allows one to obtain the exact asymptotic form of the wave

function and to improve the accuracy of the numerical calculations. The system of HREs is

obtained by expanding the total wave function in a set of eigenfunctions on the hypersphere

Although two inﬁnite systems of HREs (9) and (10) are equivalent, the truncated ones give

rise to diﬀerent results, which allows one to estimate convergence with increasing number

of HREs N in practical calculations. Notice that N HREs of the form (9) reduce to the

of HREs (10), at least in the one-channel approximation, gives the lower bound for the

ground-state energy [47]. Solution of the system (9) generally provides faster convergence

with increasing number of equations, while solution of the system (10) does not require

elaborate calculation of Pnm(R). Notice that the scattering length can be calculated by
solving only the truncated system (9) because the ﬁrst-channel eﬀective potential U ef f

A. Eigenvalue problem on the hypersphere

It is convenient to take account of the permutation symmetry and to satisfy the boundary

condition (7) by means of the Faddeev-like decomposition,

Φ(α, θ, R) =

χ(αi, R) ,

(15)

Xi=1
provided the function χ(αi, R) is symmetrical under the permutation of the particles j and

k and satisﬁes the same equation on a hypersphere (6) as the eigenfunction Φ(α, θ, R).

The representation (15) is advantageous due to a simple structure of the function χ(α, R),

which is singular only at one point α = 0 and does not depend on θ because of the s-wave

boundary condition. Following Eq. (7), the boundary condition for the function χ(αi, R)

takes the form,

notation, was derived in Ref. [40] in the limit of the zero interaction range.

Considering the solution of Eq. (18), it is worthwhile to note that the left-hand side is

an even function of ξ, i.e., R is a function of ξ2. Similar to the corresponding eigenvalue

equation in 3D [34, 35], the transcendental equation (18) determines the inﬁnitely multi-

valued function ξ2(R) for an arbitrary complex-valued variable R. In particular, diﬀerent

B. Derivation of the coupling terms

An important advantage of the BCM is the analytical expression (18) for the eigenpoten-

tials ξ2

n(R) in HREs that allows one to study the asymptotic properties of the solution and

to simplify the numerical calculation thus improving its accuracy. Evidently, the analytical

expressions are strongly desirable for the coupling terms Qnm(R) and Pnm(R). Whereas

the direct evaluation of Qnm(R) and Pnm(R) by means of the deﬁnitions (12), (13) is quite

involved, fortunately, one can circumvent this obstacle by using the explicit dependence on

the parameter R in the eigenvalue problem (6), (7). Thus, within the framework of the

BCM one derives the analytical expression for Q(ρ) and P (ρ) via eigenpotentials ξ2

n(R) and

their derivatives over R.

The derivation of all the terms in HREs is accomplished with the exact expressions (29),

One should emphasize generality of the derived analytical expressions (29), (31), and (35).

The derivation is based essentially on the BCM used to describe the pair-wise interaction.

Within the framework of the BCM the described procedure is applicable to derivation of the

three two-species fermions in 3D [50].

C. Asymptotic expansions and boundary conditions for HREs

Asymptotic expansions for all the terms of HREs are of interest for qualitative study of

the described three-body system. In addition, the explicit asymptotic form allows one to for-

mulate the boundary conditions and to improve the accuracy of the numerical calculations.

The analytical expressions derived in the preceding sections provide a straightforward deter-

mination of the eigenpotentials and the coupling terms in the asymptotic region

R

.

The expansion of eigenpotentials ξ2

follows from the expansion of the

eigenvalue equation (18) at the singular points, i. e., near the odd integer ξ (except ξ = 3)

and at inﬁnite ξ. In particular, the expansion at ξ

thus being applicable for both large R and n. The expansion is constructed by using the

requirement that both the ξn(R) and their derivatives over R for n > 2 coincide with the

The asymptotic expansion of the solution (52) at R

IV. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

The eigenpotentials ξ2

n(R) and the coupling terms Pnm(R) and Qnm(R) in HREs were

calculated by solving the transcendental eigenvalue equation (18) and by using Eqs. (29), (31)

and (35). The derivatives with respect to R (ξ′n, ξ′′n and ξ′′′n ) were replaced by the derivatives
of the inverse function (dR/dξ, d2R/dξ2, and d3R/dξ3) which are easily calculable from the

eigenvalue equation (18). The most involved numerical problem is to calculate the Legendre

function and its derivatives with respect to the index entering into Eqs. (18), (29), (31)

and (35). This is done for both real and imaginary ξ by using the Mehler-Dirichlet integral

representation [49],

these terms to the ﬁnal values. The sum rule (14) for the coupling terms was numerically

Following the described procedure, the truncated system of N HREs in two forms (9)

R

and (10) was numerically solved on the ﬁnite interval [Rmin, Rmax]. At the ﬁrst step,

Eq. (55) was integrated and the matrix T = (1

B)−

1(1 + B) was determined at the

−

mesh points on [Rmin, Rmax]. An arbitrary antisymmetric matrix B0 serves as the initial

condition for the matrix equation (55) imposed at Rmin. The consistency of the numerical

procedure was additionally shown by checking the stability of the calculated values for

diﬀerent choices of the initial matrix T(Rmin). Given the calculated transformation matrix

T(R), two eigenenergies and the scattering length were calculated by solving the eigenvalue

problem and the scattering problem at the threshold energy E =

4e−

2γ for the transformed

HREs. The zero boundary conditions are imposed in the upper channels, i. e., fn(Rmin) =

fn(Rmax) = 0 for n

2, whereas the left-end boundary condition in the ﬁrst channel

was determined from the asymptotic form of the f1(R) at R

(47). At the right

boundary, one uses f1(Rmax) = 0 for the eigenvalue problem and the asymptotic form (52)

for the scattering problem. In the latter case, the scattering length is determined via the

coeﬃcients C1,2 calculated at Rmax , viz., ln A =

which is routinely used in the variational calculations.

In the present calculations, it is

reasonable to ﬁt separately each of three families, i. e., to take into account the periodic

dependence on N for N = 3m, 3m + 1, 3m + 2. The calculated binding energies are fairly

system (10) provides slower convergence with increasing number of channels N than those

a set of binding energies converging as N −

convergence rate of

The calculated binding energies coincide within the declared accuracy with the solution of

the momentum-space integral equations [29], which underlines equivalence of quite diﬀerent

approaches. The binding energies of a limited accuracy obtained by solving the system

of HREs Ref. [40] are in agreement with the one-channel calculation of the present paper.

The older results of [8] obtained by solving the integral equations are of low accuracy; in

addition, the ground-state energy of [8] is above the upper bound found in the present paper.

The calculations of the 2 + 1 scattering length are rarely available in the literature. The

present calculation of the 2 + 1 scattering length in the universal limit could be compared

with the results of Ref. [25] by analyzing the dependence of ¯a3 on ¯a2 shown in Fig. 1 of that

paper. The three-boson scattering length ¯a3 is related to the scattering length A deﬁned in
the present paper as ¯a3 = (2/π) ln(2A/√3), whereas the two-body scattering length ¯a2 is
deﬁned in [25] so that the universal limit corresponds to ¯a2 →

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Universal description of three identical spinless bosons in 2D at low energy is expected

by analogy with low-energy properties of two particles, which are universal (irrespective of

a particular shape of the short-range potential) and parameterless if the only signiﬁcant

parameter, e. g., the two-body scattering length a, is chosen as a scale. The two-body input

completely determines the solution near the triple-collision point in the limit of the zero-

range interactions, therefore, contrary to the corresponding problem in 3D, an additional

24

regularization parameter is not necessary and there are neither Thomas nor Eﬁmov eﬀect

in 2D. For this reason, a completely universal parameterless description exists in the low-

energy limit and both three-body binding energies and the 2 + 1 scattering length are the

universal constants to be determined.

The BCM is used to describe the pair-wise short-range interaction in the zero-range limit.

The total wave function is expanded in a set of eigenfunctions on the hypersphere, which

leads to a system of coupled HREs. The important point is that the analytical expressions

are derived for all the terms of HREs, which allows one to study the asymptotic behaviour

and to improve the accuracy of the numerical calculations. One should emphasize that the

derivation is essentially based on application of the BCM and the Hellmann-Feynman-type

relations, the latter are known to be useful in the calculation of the coupling terms [52].

Moreover, the derivation is generally applicable to a variety of three-body problems in ar-

bitrary dimensions, in particular, the analytical expressions of the same form are obtained

for three identical bosons [35] and for three two-component fermions [50] in 3D. All the

considerations and the approach used are equally applicable to description of three identical

1D bosons, for which the exact solution is known. For these reasons, a brief discussion and

numerical calculations for the 1D case are presented in the Appendix to make comparison

with 2D results and to check the numerical procedure.

The analytic expressions are used to analyze all the terms of HREs in the asymptotic

region, thus obtaining the asymptotic form of the total wave function both for large and

small inter-particle separation. In this respect, the universal dependence (49) is obtained

for the total wave function in the vicinity of the triple-collision point with the leading
ln3ρ and the inter-particle correlations given by ln x1x2x3. The large-R asymptotic

term

expansions are not uniform in channel number n, therefore, the explicit dependence on n is

deduced, which reveals convergence of the eigenpotentials and coupling terms to the limiting

functions of R

ln n = ln(ρ/n) at large n. The convergence is rather slow and the next-order

term (

n−

1/2) in the large-n expansion is periodic in n with period 3; this is displayed by

−

observing three families of eigenpotentials and coupling terms, namely, for diﬀerent n mod

∼

∼

3. The asymptotic dependence on n is used to study the eﬀect of the channel coupling and

to shed light on the convergence of the results with increasing number of HREs. One of the

reasons for slow convergence is the long-range polarization tail

2R

e−

ρ−

4 of the ﬁrst-

∼

∼

channel eﬀective potential and the same order long-range term which arises due to coupling

25

with the upper channels. As a result, one needs to take into account a large number of

HREs to study the long-range behaviour of the wave function and the next-to-leading terms

of the low-energy eﬀective-range expansion for 2 + 1 scattering.

The universal constants, viz., the ground-state and excited-state three-body binding en-

ergies and the 2 + 1 scattering length, are calculated with high precision by the numerical

solution of HREs. The binding energies are in excellent agreement (within the declared

accuracy) with those obtained in the momentum-space calculations [29], which underlines

equivalence of two essentially distinct models. The low-energy scattering of the dimer oﬀ

the third particle is completely described by the precise 2 + 1 scattering length.

In summary, universal low-energy properties of three identical two-dimensional bosons

are considered within the framework of the BCM used to describe two-body interactions.

The approach used is based on the solution of a system of HREs, all the terms of which

are derived in the analytical form. The derivation is quite general and can be applied to

a number of problems, especially if the interaction is described within the framework of

the BCM. The asymptotic form of the solutions of HREs is obtained, which allows one to

describe the wave function both at large and small inter-particle separations. The binding

energies and the 2 + 1 scattering length of high precision are numerically calculated.

APPENDIX A: THREE ONE-DIMENSIONAL PARTICLES

In this appendix, the three-body problem in 1D is considered to demonstrate general

applicability of the approach used, to check the numerical accuracy, and to compare conver-

gence of the 1D and 2D calculations. The choice is based on well-known exact solubility of

the one-dimensional N-body problem with the zero-range interactions [41, 42]). As usual, the

problem becomes parameterless by introducing the natural units ¯h = m = 1 and by choosing

the potential strength to ﬁx at unit values both the two-body binding energy, ǫ2 = 1, and

the two-body scattering length, a = 1. The exact result for the binding energy of n identical
particles in 1D [41, 42] is ǫn = 1

1). One should also mention that the ground-state

6n(n2

wave function of three identical particles is of a simple form Ψgs = C exp(

the scaled Jacobi coordinates xi and yi are introduced similar to the above-discussed 2D

Thereafter, the approach described in the paper is applied to calculate the three-body

binding energy ǫ3 and the 2 + 1 scattering length A of three identical particles in 1D. The

wave function satisﬁes either the equation

Eigenpotentials in these systems are deﬁned by the solution of the eigenvalue problem on a

circle and the coupling terms are deﬁned by the analytical expressions of the same form (29),

(31), and (35) as in 2D, provided the derivatives are taken over ρ. Recall that the derivation

Similar to the 2D case, the numerical solution of the HREs in the form (9), (10) with

zero boundary conditions gives the three-body binding energy, whereas the solution at the

the second type of truncation of the HREs provides energies converging to the exact values

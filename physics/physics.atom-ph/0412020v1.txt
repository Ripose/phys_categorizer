Small clusters of fermions

Several theoretical studies [1] indicate that there is no any reasonable chance for 3n and
4n to be bound. GANIL experiment [2] suggesting tetraneutron has not been conﬁrmed
but these no-result had however the merit of pushing theoreticians at work to clarify
the possible existence of small n-clusters.
If the situation seems clear for A=3 and 4,
it is less well established for a larger number of neutrons. The search of multi-neutron
resonances raises also some interest and a recent experiment scanning the 4n continuum
in the d(8He,6 Li)4n reaction reports a 2-3 MeV width structure [3].

In this issue it is enlightening to make a parallel with a similar, better-known, fermionic
system: the 3He atomic clusters. Since small 3He droplets can exist [4], should we expect
some stability islands (see ﬁgure below) in the continuum neutron states going from N=2
to N=

. If yes, where? If not, why?

The two-body interactions of these systems look at ﬁrst glance quite similar. We have
compared in Fig. 1 the n-n AV18 [5] and the 3He-3He Aziz [6] S-wave potentials. They
have been rescaled by the corresponding masses M
¯h2 and the resulting length units, as well
as the inter-particle distance d are f m and ˚A respectively. Corresponding low energy
parameters are given in Table 1. In the n-n case we have also considered Reid93 [7] and
MT13 [8] potentials, the latter being adjusted to reproduce the experimental scattering
length. None of these system supports a bound dimer (a < 0) but 3He seems less favorable

to make clusters. This can be seen by calculating the critical values of the scaling factor
ηc introduced in the potential V (η)(r) = ηVnn(r), which bounds a dimer. For n-n, this
value is around ηc = 1.08 whereas for He-He is sensibly greater ηc = 1.30 (see Table 1).

When examining larger systems we ﬁrst consider the bosonic case. Despite the absence
of dimers, ”bosonic” neutron trimers and tetramers do exist with binding energies Bn3 ≈
10 MeV. This is however not the case for atomic 3He, suggesting
1 MeV and Bn4 ≈
once more that neutron clusters should be favored with respect to atomic 3He. They
all disappear when the Pauli principle is imposed, but can reappear – as in 3He – if the
number of interacting particles is increased. The existence of small clusters results thus
from a compromise between an attractive pairwise interaction and the eﬀective Pauli
repulsion.

In order to study such a balance, we have investigated in several directions [9]: (i)
scaling factor in Vnn, (ii) three-neutron interactions (TnI), (iii) inﬂuence of n-n P- waves
(iv) conﬁning the system in an harmonic oscillator (HO) trap and (iv) ”dimer”-”dimer”
scattering.
It is always possible to bind 3- and 4-n states by modifying the usual n-n
and/or TnI models but the violation has to be very strong, producing serious anomalies.
Thus, in case (i) one needs a large scaling factor ηc ∼
3. Using ad-hoc TnI, one gets a
very compact object in which NN force becomes even repulsive. Keeping the usual S-wave
n-n potential, the enhancement of n-n P-waves required to bound a 3- or 4-n system is
such that they become themselves resonant!

can be properly separated. In absence of n-n forces the ”internal” energies are known
analytically but can be obtained as well by solving the N-body ”internal” problem, with

4 (ii) one has always B4 > 2B2, suggesting an eﬀective attraction between
N=2
dineutrons (iii) the binding energy per particle increases when going from N=2 to N=4
(iv) the ratio BN
EHO tends to a constant value independent of b. The preceding results tend
to indicate that there is a beneﬁt when going from 2 to 4. The main diﬀerence in respect
to 3He has been found in the role of P-waves. Their inﬂuence in n case is attractive
but very small whereas they signiﬁcantly contribute to the 3He binding energy (
40%).
The reason for such a diﬀerent behaviour is the hard core radius of the corresponding
potentials, which diﬀer by a factor 3 (see Fig. 1). The centrifugal barrier is one order of
magnitude smaller in 3He and the eﬀective potential is, contrary to n case, still attractive
in regions where it can play a role. This diﬀerence can be dramatic in binding larger
fermion systems.

∼

Despite the negative results quoted in [1], the question of larger neutron clusters merits
some attention. At present, the strongest argument against their existence are the mean-
ﬁeld results, all concluding to an unbounded inﬁnite nuclear matter but it should be
possible to reach the same conclusion ”from below”, i.e. from a systematic study of few-
neutron systems. This can be performed by studying the N-dependence of the critical
scaling factor ηc, calculated simultaneously for n and 3He. Our technology allow us to
reach only N=4 with the results displayed on Fig. 2. The value η(n)
c makes a large jump
when passing from N=2 to N=3 but starts to decreases when going from N=3 to N=4. Is
that a pure numerical accident or, as in 3He, an indication of a descent towards the η = 1
axis?. More powerful methods could go far beyond N=4 and draw a deﬁnite conclusion
on this problem.

standard

Black-body radiation (BBR) shift is an important systematic correction for the atomic frequency
standards realizing the SI unit of time. Presently, there is a controversy over the value of the BBR
shift for the primary 133Cs standard. At room temperatures the values from various groups diﬀer at
3 × 10−15 level, while the modern clocks are aiming at 10−16 accuracies. We carry out high-precision
relativistic many-body calculations of the BBR shift. For the BBR coeﬃcient β at T = 300K we

obtain β = −(1.708±0.006)×10
the most accurate measurement, our 0.35%-accurate value is in a substantial, 10%, disagreement
with recent semi-empirical calculations. We identify an oversight in those calculations.

Since 1967, the SI unit of time, the second, is deﬁned
as a duration of a certain number of periods of radiation
corresponding to the transition between two hyperﬁne
levels (F = 4 and F = 3) of the ground state of the
133Cs atom. In 1997, this deﬁnition has been amended,
to specify that the above statement refers to the atom
at a temperature of 0 K (and at rest) [1]. The atomic
clocks are usually operated at room temperatures and
the speciﬁc reference to T = 0 K implies that a proper
correction for the action of the thermal bath of photons
on the atomic energy levels is explicitly introduced. For
133Cs clocks, it is an important systematic correction [2],
as the resulting fractional correction to atomic frequency
due to black-body radiation (BBR) at T = 300 is in the
order of 10−14. Moreover, presently, there is a contro-
versy over the value of the BBR shift for the primary
133Cs standard. At T = 300 K the values from various
10−15 level, while modern
groups [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] diﬀer at 3
Cs clocks aim at 10−16 accuracies [8].

×

The persistent discrepancies in the BBR shift have
prompted the eﬀorts at the US National Institute for
Standards and Technology (NIST) on removing the sensi-
tivity to BBR by operating the primary standard at cryo-
genic temperatures [9] (BBR shift scales as T 4). How-
ever, because of the weight limitations, this direct ap-
proach would be hardy feasible if next-generation atomic
clock were to be operated at the International Space
Station [8]. This ongoing controversy and implications
for atomic time-keeping serve as motivations for our pa-
per. Here we compute the 133Cs BBR shift using high-
accuracy relativistic many-body techniques of atomic
structure. Our evaluated error in the BBR shift implies
10−17 fractional uncertainty in the clock frequency
6
with the value of the BBR shift consistent with the most
accurate (0.2%-accurate) measurement [3]. However, our
0.35%-accurate value is in a substantial 10% disagree-
ment with recent semi-empirical calculations [6, 7]. We
show that this discrepancy is due to contributions of the
intermediate continuum states omitted in those calcula-
tions.

×

First, let us review underlying theory of the Cs BBR

shift. BBR causes a weak oscillating perturbation of
atomic energy levels. Conventionally, the leading term
in the BBR contribution is parameterized as the frac-
tional correction to the unperturbed clock frequency,
ν0 = 9 192 631 770 Hz,

δνBBR/ν0 = β

(T /T0)4 ,

×

where T0 = 300 K. Evaluation of the coeﬃcient β is
the goal of this work. This coeﬃcient can be related
to the scalar diﬀerential polarizability for the hyperﬁne
manifold of the 6s1/2 Cs ground state. Indeed, the char-
acteristic thermal photon energy at room temperatures
is much smaller then the atomic energies, so that the
perturbation can be well described in the static limit.
Moreover, contributions of electro-magnetic BBR multi-
poles beyond electric dipoles, as well as retardation cor-
rections, are highly suppressed [10]. Then the BBR shift
of the energy level is given by (atomic units are used
throughout, α is the ﬁne-structure constant)

where αF (0) is the static scalar electric-dipole polariz-
ability of the hyperﬁne level F . The vector and tensor
parts of the polarizability average out due to the isotropic
nature of the BBR.

The relation of the BBR shift to polarizability has
been exploited in the most accurate measurement of
the diﬀerential Stark shift [3]. However, recent di-
rect temperature-dependent measurement [5] of the BBR
shift turned out to be diﬀering by about two standard
deviations from the indirect measurement. Namely this
diﬀerence has stimulated the recent interest in the Cs
BBR shift.

The overall BBR shift of the clock frequency is the
diﬀerence of the individual shifts for the two hyperﬁne
states (F = 4 and F = 3) involved in the transition.
While taking the diﬀerence, the traditional lowest-order
polarizability of the 6s1/2 level cancels out and one needs
to evaluate the third-order F -dependent polarizability

The summation indexes m and n range over valence

single-particle core orbitals. With this convention, the
above expressions subsume contributions from intermedi-

account so-called core-valence counter-terms [13]. Selec-

Numerical evaluation of the diagrams T ,C, and R can
be carried out either using the Dalgarno-Lewis method or
by directly summing over individual intermediate states.
Here we use the direct summation approach. This treat-
ment is similar to the one used in high-accuracy cal-
culations of atomic parity violation in 133Cs [14]. The
main advantage of this method is that one could explic-
itly exploit high-accuracy experimental data for energies,
dipole-matrix elements, and hyperﬁne constants. When
the accurate values are unknown, we use ab initio data
of proper accuracy. In addition, this approach facilitates
comparison with recent calculations [6, 7], which also use
the direct summation approach.

The central technical issue arising in direct summation
over a complete set of states is representation of the in-
numerable spectrum of atomic states. For example, even
without the continuum, the bound spectrum contains an
inﬁnite number of states. A powerful numerical method
for reducing the inﬁnite summations/integrations to a ﬁ-
nite number of contributions is the basis set technique.
In particular, we employ the B-spline technique [15]. In
this approach an atom is placed in a large spherical cav-
ity and the single-particle Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) or-
bitals are expanded in terms of a ﬁnite set of B-splines.
The expansion coeﬃcients are obtained by invoking vari-
ational Galerkin principle. The resulting set of the single-
particle orbitals is numerically complete and ﬁnite. The
technique has a high numerical accuracy and we refer
the reader to a review [16] on numerous applications of
B-splines for details.

We use B-spline set with 70 splines of order 7 for each
partial wave and constrain the orbitals to a cavity of
radius Rcav = 220 a.u. This particular choice of Rcav
ensures that the lowest-energy atomic orbitals are not
perturbed by the cavity. In particular, all core and va-
lence DHF orbitals with radial quantum numbers 1
12
from the basis set produce energies and matrix elements
in a close numerical agreement with the data from tra-
ditional ﬁnite-diﬀerence DHF code. These low-energy
orbitals will produce true many-body states for a cavity-
unconstrained atom.

To understand the relative role of various contribu-
tions, we start by computing the Stark shift at the DHF
level. We obtain:

the top and residual terms dominate over the center di-

not as rapid, but still the dominant contributions come
from the lowest-energy excitations: limiting the summa-
tions to the ﬁrst four excited states recovers only 68%
of the total value for the top diagram. In addition, we
ﬁnd that core-excited states contribute only 0.04% to the
ﬁnal value.

The above observations determine our strategy for
more accurate calculations. We group the entire set
of atomic states into the “main” low-lying-energy states
(principal quantum numbers n <= 12) and remaining
“tail” states. We will account for the contribution from
the “main” states using high-accuracy experimental and
ab initio values. The contribution from the “tail” will be
obtained using either DHF or mixed approach.

First, we describe the high-accuracy data used in
our calculations. We need dipole and hyperﬁne ma-
trix elements and energies. Experimental values for
the dipole matrix elements for the following six transi-
tions were taken from the literature (see compilations in

correlations become less important, so the dominant cor-
relation correction comes from the 6s1/2 state. Using
the described mixed approach allows us to account for
this dominant correlation. The geometric-mean formula
holds only for the s states. For the oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements between various combinations of 6p1/2,3/2 and
np1/2,3/2 (n = 6
9) states we employed a modiﬁca-
tion of the LCCSD method augmented by perturbative
treatment of the valence triple excitations (LCCSDpvT
method) [18]. The accuracy of these matrix elements is
a few %. As these matrix elements enter the relatively
small center term, the eﬀect on the overall theoretical
error is negligible.

Finally, we used experimental energy values from the
NIST tabulation [23], for states with principle quantum

The values of the individual diagrams are 2T
kS = 0.449,
C
kS =
kS = 0.553. When comparing with
the DHF values, the most substantial modiﬁcation due
to correlations is in the center term, which changes the
sign. Fortunately, this term is relatively small, and this
extreme change does not substantially aﬀect the ﬁnal re-
sult.

The overall uncertainty of these results was determined
from the uncertainties of the individual matrix elements
and energy values used in their computation. Standard
uncertainty analysis was done throughout all mathemat-
ical operations. For energy values taken from NIST, the
uncertainty is assumed negligible. For all other experi-
mental values, the reported uncertainty is used. For ab
initio matrix elements (DHF, LCCSD, or LCCSDpvT)
we assigned an assumed uncertainty. These assumed un-
certainties were based on comparison between calculated
and high-accuracy experimental values. This resulted in
a relative uncertainty for both the scalar Stark coeﬃcient
and the BBR shift of 0.35%. We have performed several
consistency checks, e.g., replacing experimental matrix
elements and energies by ab initio LCCSD values or by
27 with
replacing the DHF values for states with n = 13
the LCCSD values. The ﬁnal result was stable to such
modiﬁcations within the stated uncertainty in Eq.(3).
These tests provide us with additional conﬁdence with
respect to our standard error analysis based on errors of
used experimental values. It is also worth noting that the
present calculation does not include radiative corrections
which may contribute at the level of a few 0.1% (some
radiative corrections, e.g., vacuum polarization, are ab-

hyperﬁne constants).

A comparison with recent theoretical and experimen-
tal work is presented in Table I. While agreeing with
the most accurate measurement by Simon et al. [3], our
results are in substantial disagreement with the recent
calculations [6, 7]. The principal diﬀerences between the
present work and these calculations are: (i) more sophis-
ticated treatment of correlations, and (ii) rigorous sum-
mation over the complete set of intermediate states in
perturbative expressions. As discussed above, we used
the numerically complete basis-set approach which ap-
proximates Rydberg states and continuum with quasi-
spectrum. By contrast, in Ref. [6], the summations were
truncated at n = 9, and in Ref. [7] at n = 18; neither
work includes continuum. To illuminate the importance
of the omitted contributions we truncate our summations

at n = 12. The resulting value deviates from our ﬁnal ks
10−10 Hz/(V/m)2. This large 10% “con-
result by 0.29
tinuum correction” brings the values from Refs. [6, 7]
into essential agreement with our result. The fact that
continuum needs to be included is hardly surprising, as,
for example, about 20% of the textbook polarizability of
the ground state of the hydrogen atom comes from the
continuum states.

To conclude, here we have reported results of rela-
tivistic many-body calculations of the BBR shift, one
of the leading systematic correction in 133Cs frequency
standard and a subject of the recent controversy. Our
0.35%-accurate result re-validates high-precision Stark
shift measurements [3]. Our work also clariﬁes the origin
of the reported discrepancy between that measurement
and recent calculations [6, 7].

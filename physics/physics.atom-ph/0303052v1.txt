Recent experiments have demonstrated the spontaneous evolution of a gas of ultracold Rydberg
atoms into an expanding ultracold plasma, as well as the reverse process of plasma recombination
into highly excited atomic states. Treating the evolution of the plasma on the basis of kinetic
equations, while ionization/excitation and recombination are incorporated using rate equations, we
have investigated theoretically the Rydberg-to-plasma transition. Including the inﬂuence of spatial
correlations on the plasma dynamics in an approximate way we ﬁnd that ionic correlations change
the results only quantitatively but not qualitatively.

Advances in cooling and trapping of neutral gases have
opened up a new branch of atomic physics, namely dy-
namics in ultracold (T ≪ 1 K) systems. One interesting
topic is the physics of ultracold Rydberg gases and ultra-
In recent experiments, ultracold
cold neutral plasmas.
neutral plasmas have been produced from a small cloud
of laser-cooled atoms conﬁned in a magneto-optical trap
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
In the experiments performed at NIST
[1, 2, 3], a plasma was produced by photoionizing laser-
cooled Xe atoms with an initial ion temperature of about
10 µK. By tuning the frequency of the ionizing laser, the
initial electron energy Ee was varied corresponding to
a temperature range 1 K < Ee/kB < 1000 K, and the
subsequent expansion of the plasma into the surround-
ing vacuum was studied systematically. Remarkably, a
signiﬁcant amount of recombination was observed as the
plasma expands, leading to the formation of Rydberg
atoms from the plasma.
In a complementary type of
experiment [4, 5], ultracold atoms were laser-excited into
high Rydberg states rather than directly ionized. In these
experiments, also the reverse process has been observed,
namely the spontaneous evolution of the Rydberg gas
into a plasma.

An issue in the theoretical considerations [6, 7, 8, 9]
stimulated by the experiments has been the question
whether the evolving plasma is strongly coupled or not.
Due to the very low initial temperature, the electron
Coulomb coupling parameter Γe(t = 0) is found to be
signiﬁcantly larger than one (Γe = e2/(akBTe), where
a is the Wigner-Seitz radius). On the other hand, it
has been pointed out in [6] that, for the initial condi-
tions of the NIST experiments [1, 2, 3], the develop-
ment of equilibrium electron-electron correlations leads
to a rapid heating of the electron gas, which brings Γe
down to order unity on a very short timescale.
In [6],
this was demonstrated by a molecular-dynamics simu-
lation of the electron and ion motion. The calculation
was limited to a short time interval (≈ 100 nanoseconds)
in the initial stage of the plasma evolution due to the
large numerical eﬀort required. For the ﬁrst quantita-
tive comparison with experiment the plasma dynamics

has been modeled within a kinetic approach, while ion-
ization, excitation and recombination has been treated
by a separate set of rate equations [7]. The electron
dynamics was described in an adiabatic approximation
with the atom and ion temperatures set to zero. Since
this model does only account for the mean-ﬁeld poten-
tial created by the charges, possible correlation heating
could not be described. Nevertheless, due to heating by
three-body recombination events, Γe does not exceed a
value of ≈ 0.2 during the plasma expansion. Hence, the
inﬂuence of electronic correlations on the plasma dynam-
ics could be neglected. With zero ionic temperature the
ionic Coulomb coupling parameter, however, is inﬁnite
in the framework of this model. Consequently, the role
of ion-ion correlations could not be estimated.

Our description is similar to that of [7] with small
diﬀerences, e.g., inclusion of black-body radiation as a
source for photoionization. This is necessary to describe
the initial ionization of the Rydberg gas in the experi-
ments [4, 5] since the ionization rate through cold atom-
atom collisions is much lower at these densities. More
importantly, in addition to [7] we allow for possible spa-
tial correlation eﬀects. Brieﬂy, we use a set of kinetic
equations for the plasma expansion, combined with rate
equations for the description of ionization/excitation and
recombination. The kinetic equations are derived from
the ﬁrst equation of the BBGKY hierarchy, which yields
the standard Vlasov equation for the evolution of a colli-
sionless plasma, augmented by additional terms account-
ing for spatial correlations. Since the electronic Coulomb
coupling parameter is well below unity under all exper-
imental conditions realized so far (as we have convinced
ourselves including electronic correlations on the basis of
two-component Debye-H¨uckel theory; see also [7]) we ne-
glect them and treat the ions as a one-component plasma
embedded in a neutralizing background.

Assuming that the correlation function vanishes at dis-
tances larger than the correlation length ac and that the
spatial density varies slowly over a distance ac, we ﬁnd
that the force induced by ionic correlations can be ex-
pressed in terms of the local correlation energy per par-

analytical formulae have been given for a wide range of
Γ. We use

The timescale for relaxation towards the individual
equilibrium of electrons and ions, respectively, is deter-
mined by the corresponding inverse plasma frequency
ω−1
m/4πρe2 [12]. Under typical conditions of the
p =
experiments [1, 2, 3, 4], it is of the order of 10−9s for elec-
trons, while equilibration of the ions takes between 10−7s
and 10−5s depending on ρ. These timescales for equili-
bration have to be seen relative to the expansion time of
the plasma, which is of the order of several 10−6s. Hence,
an adiabatic approximation for the electron distribution
function can be safely applied, such that the kinetic equa-
tion for the electronic component of the plasma yields a
relation allowing one to express the mean-ﬁeld potential
in terms of the density ρe, which can be inserted into the
corresponding equation for the ions.

The much slower equilibration of the ions renders
an adiabatic approximation a priori diﬃcult. However,
even in situations where static parameters, e.g., relevant
masses, periods or rates, speak against an adiabatic treat-
ment it is sometimes made possible through dynamical
adiabaticity (see, e.g., [13]). Of course, this can only
be veriﬁed a posteriori by more elaborate calculations
without adiabatic approximation. For now, we simply
assume an adiabatic time evolution of the plasma, i.e. we
estimate the ionic correlation energy from its equilibrium
value eq. (2) and use a homogeneous ion temperature at
all times. This is the opposite limit to a zero ionic tem-
perature which would never lead to equilibration. Hence,
our results are expected to clarify whether (and to what
extent) correlation eﬀects can have any inﬂuence on the
dynamics at all.

The large diﬀerence in timescales between ionic and
electronic motion justiﬁes the quasineutral approxima-
tion ρe = ρi = ρ [14] applicable under the experimental
conditions in [1, 2, 3, 4]. Under these circumstances a
closed equation for the ion distribution function is ob-
tained and the resulting equation without the correlation
term permits selfsimilar analytical solutions [14]. One of
them is the gaussian proﬁle describing the initial state in

2

the experiments under consideration. Exact selfsimilar
solutions exist even in the case of an additional linear
force [15]. This condition is satisﬁed by the correlation
force to a good approximation save for the outer periph-
ery of the plasma [16]. Hence, we can write

i.e. the sum of the kinetic energy and the correlation en-
druiiρ. The set of equations (4) reduces to
ergy Uc =
the one used in [7] if the correlation term is dropped and
Ti ≡ 0. More recently, it has been shown by compari-
son with more sophisticated calculations that this simple
ansatz provides a good description of the plasma dynam-
ics even if some of the assumptions, such as the quasineu-
trality of the plasma and the gaussian distribution of the
densities, only hold approximately [17] .

The low-temperature enhancement of the expansion
velocity of the ultracold plasma produced in [2] can be
well described by combining a hydrodynamic descrip-
tion of the expansion dynamics with conventional rate
equations accounting for inelastic collisions between the
plasma particles and Rydberg atoms [7]. As a result, the
total kinetic energy becomes a function of time since the
Rydberg atoms act as energy sinks and sources. In our
calculations, we include bound-bound transitions by elec-
tron impact excitation and deexcitation, and bound-free
transitions by three-body recombination, electron impact
ionization, and black-body radiation. We use the col-
lision rate coeﬃcients derived by Mansbach and Keck
[18] and black-body photoionization is described by ﬁrst-
order perturbation theory [19], using an asymptotic ex-
pression for the atomic oscillator strengths [20].

Finally, the question of the expansion velocity of the
Rydberg atoms has to be addressed, since they are not
driven by the Coulomb drag of the expanding electrons.
Under typical experimental conditions (ρe = 109cm−3,
Te = 20 K), the timescale for electron-atom-collisions is
of the order of 10−8s. Therefore, in the course of the ex-
pansion of the plasma (10−5s) any given atom with bind-
ing energy of the order of several kBT will recombine and

FIG. 1: Time evolution of the degree of ionization for the
following initial conditions: density of atoms ρ = 8 · 109 cm−3,

and initial principal quantum number of the Rydberg atoms
n0 = 70. Results are shown with ionic correlations (solid) and
without (dashed).

re-ionize many times, changing its character between ion
and Rydberg atom. In addition, collisions between ions
and atoms signiﬁcantly equilibrate the hydrodynamical
velocities even for lower Rydberg states [21]. Following
this reasoning we assume equal hydrodynamical veloci-
ties and density proﬁles for the ions and atoms. This
implies that the expansion of the neutral Rydberg atoms
can be simply taken into account by changing the mass
of the ions to an eﬀective mass M in Eq. (4) which is the
total mass of the total system (plasma + atoms).

We have simulated the expansion of an initially fully
ionized plasma as reported in [2, 3]. In accordance with
previous calculations [7], we ﬁnd quantitative agreement
for the electron energy dependence of the asymptotic ex-
pansion velocity. Furthermore, the calculations qualita-
tively reproduce the nonmonotonic time dependence of
the number of detected atoms observed in [3]. We note
that the ionic correlations do not signiﬁcantly change the
plasma dynamics for these experiments.

The results of our calculations for the experiments
[4, 5] are summarized in ﬁgures 1 to 3. Figure 1 shows the
degree of ionization of the Rydberg gas, i.e. the plasma
fraction of the system, as a function of time during the
expansion of the system. For comparison, the result with-
out correlation (Uc = Ti ≡ 0 in eqs. (4) and (5)) is also
shown. As has been observed experimentally, it takes of
the order of two to three microseconds before signiﬁcant
plasma formation occurs which sets in with an ionization
avalanche. Note that the early time development includ-
ing the ionization avalanche is obviously not inﬂuenced
by the ionic correlations. Their development requires a
signiﬁcant amount of charged plasma particles which are
only available after the ionization avalanche. The pro-
duction of initial “seed charges” by black-body radiation
does not depend on ionic correlations. The ionization
avalanche appears somewhat (≈ 1µs) earlier than in the
experiment since in reality the ﬁrst electrons produced

by the black-body radiation will leave the atom cloud
until a suﬃciently strong positive space charge builds up
to trap the electrons. With the increasing number of free
charges, the plasma forms quickly, followed by a partial
back evolution into a Rydberg gas. Fig. 1 shows that
this part of the gas dynamics may indeed be aﬀected by
ion-ion correlation, which leads to a more eﬃcient recom-
bination in the ﬁnal stage of the plasma evolution. The
reason for this behavior can be understood from eqs. (4)
and (5). Together, Wc and Uc lead to an additional ac-
celeration (2/9 Uc if Eq. (2) is used for u) in addition
to the ideal thermal electron pressure kBTe. Hence, the
adiabatic electron cooling during the expansion is faster
than without correlations. In turn recombination is ac-
celerated, since the corresponding rate strongly increases
with decreasing temperature. We note that correspond-
ing eﬀects of the same order of magnitude are also found
for the experiments [2, 3]. The reason that they do not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the expansion dynamics of the plasma
part lies in the fact that the correlations mainly inﬂuence
the recombination into high-lying states at later stages of
the evolution. Since these are very weakly bound, they
hardly inﬂuence the kinetic energy of the system which
determines the expansion velocity. Hence, good agree-
ment is found between calculations with and without in-
clusion of correlation eﬀects as long as quantities related
to the plasma expansion are compared.

Figure 2 illustrates the dependence of the plasma evo-
lution on the initial conditions. For ﬁxed initial width
of the Rydberg atom cloud (Fig. 2a), the plasma for-
mation occurs earlier with increasing density, due to the
fact that ionization is faster and more eﬃcient at higher
densities. The later stages of the evolution, on the other
hand, depend only weakly on the density. This may be
attributed to the fact that in the evolution equation (4),

ρ enters only in the form N/M , i.e. essentially as the
degree of ionization. For ﬁxed initial density ρ, the ion-
ization avalanche occurs at the same time, in accordance
with the argument made previously (Fig. 2b). However,
for smaller width, the plasma expands faster, leading ul-
timately to lower electron temperatures and increased re-
combination. Finally, if the number of atoms Na is kept
ﬁxed the density changes when the size of the atom cloud
is varied. Hence, Fig. 2c can be interpreted as the com-
bined eﬀect seen in Figs. 2a,b: The ionization avalanche
occurs at diﬀerent times for each curve (due to diﬀerent
atomic densities) and the relaxation leads to diﬀerent ﬁ-
nal degrees of ionization (due to the diﬀerent size of the
atomic cloud).

Figure 3 shows the non-ionized part of the gas, more
precisely the population of Rydberg levels in the initial
and ﬁnal stage of the expansion, as well as at the time
of the maximum degree of ionization. Initially, all atoms
are prepared with a principal quantum number n0 = 70.
At later times, the interplay between ionization, recom-
bination and exciting and deexciting collisions leads to
a decrease of the average excitation. This decrease in
excitation is the main source of energy that triggers the
ionization and the plasma expansion, energy absorbed
from the black-body radiation ﬁeld is negligible in com-
parison. Finally, recombination repopulates higher levels
(which “freeze out” due to the rapid decrease of elec-
tron temperature), but the peak of the distribution is
still found at relatively low excitations. It would be very
interesting to measure the ﬁnal distribution of Rydberg
atoms, which should provide a stringent test for theoret-
ical models.

In summary, we have described the formation of a cold
plasma from a highly excited Rydberg gas, using a sim-
ple model based on kinetic equations for the plasma evo-

lution. Microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations are
limited to much shorter timescales due to the large nu-
merical eﬀort required. We have estimated the maximum
eﬀect of ionic correlations by including them into the
model assuming instant equilibration of the ions. In this
respect the calculations without equilibration (no corre-
lation, ionic temperature zero) and with instant equili-
bration should bracket the actual ionization yield of the
Rydberg gas. Given the diﬀerence in the ionization yields
with and without ionic correlation in ﬁg. 1, more elabo-
rate calculations are worthwhile although at present it is
unclear whether the plasma evolution including correla-
tion can be followed over suﬃcently long times, e.g., with
P3M-codes.

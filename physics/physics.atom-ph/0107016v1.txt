Many-body calculation of nuclear spin-dependent parity-nonconserving amplitude for 7s, F =
4 → 7s, F = 5 transition between hyperﬁne sublevels of the ground state of 211Fr is carried out.
The ﬁnal result is h7s, F = 5||dPNC||7s, F = 4i = −0.49 × 10−10 i κ a.u., where κ is the dimensionless
coupling constant. This is approximately an order of magnitude larger than similar amplitude in
Cs. The dominant contribution to κ is associated with the anapole moment of the nucleus.

Introduction.

In this work we calculated nuclear
spin-dependent parity-nonconserving (PNC) amplitude
for 7s, F = 4
7s, F = 5 transition between hyper-
ﬁne structure components of the ground state of the odd
isotope of francium 211Fr. Three eﬀects contribute to this
amplitude [1]: the interaction of an electron with the nu-
clear anapole moment (AM), the electron-nuclear neutral
current interaction, and the combined action of the nu-
clear spin-independent electron-nucleus weak interaction
and the hyperﬁne interaction.

∼

The AM a was introduced by Zel’dovich [2] just after
the discovery of parity violation. A ﬁrst realistic model
for the AM of the nucleus was suggested in Refs. [3, 4].
A2/3, where
There it was shown that for heavy nuclei a
A is the number of nucleons. AMs of the nuclei with un-
paired proton are expected to be few times larger than
for the case of unpaired neutron. Because of that for
atoms with large and odd Z the AM contribution to
the spin-dependent part of the PNC amplitudes domi-
nates over that of the electron-nucleon neutral currents.
A2/3, but is numerically
The third contribution is also
smaller [5, 6] (see Eq. (3) below). Note that the neu-
tral current and hyperﬁne contributions to the nuclear
spin-dependent PNC amplitude are well known from the
standard model. Therefore, any measurement of the re-
spective coupling constant κ will give unambiguous in-
formation about AM of the nucleus.

∼

For the optical transitions in heavy atoms the spin-
independent PNC amplitudes are approximately two or-
ders of magnitude larger than the spin-dependent ones.
Because of that the AM was measured experimentally
only for cesium [7]. This measurement provided a valu-
able probe of the relatively poorly understood parity non-
conservation in nuclei [8, 9]. Further experimental and
theoretical investigations of AM are very important both
for nuclear physics and for physics of the fundamental
interactions.

An alternative possibility to observe

spin-
dependent PNC amplitudes was suggested in [10]:
in
the rf transitions between the hyperﬁne components of

the

∗Electronic address: porsev@thd.pnpi.spb.ru

the ground state of an atom the spin-independent am-
plitudes are negligible and the dominant PNC eﬀect is
caused by the AM. Using the rf resonator one can have
an additional enhancement of the PNC eﬀect by placing
the gas cell in the node of the magnetic and the antin-
ode of the electric rf ﬁelds [11]. The PNC eﬀect can be
also enhanced in the strong dc magnetic ﬁeld [12]. The
new cooling and trapping techniques allow to increase
the intensity of the rf transitions making these experi-
mental schemes much more realistic. At present there is
an ongoing project of measuring PNC eﬀects in francium
[13, 14] and the observation of the AM in the hyperﬁne
transition can be a valuable addition to this project.

Semi-empirical calculations of nuclear spin-dependent
amplitudes for transitions between hyperﬁne sublevels of
the ground state were already carried out for Cs and Tl
[10] and for K and Cs [11]. Fr is the heaviest of alkali-
metal atoms. Since spin-dependent amplitude grows with
nuclear charge Z faster than Z 2, one can expect that
for Fr this amplitude will be signiﬁcantly larger than for
other alkali-metal atoms. Besides that, a large number of
odd isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin makes it possi-
ble (at least in principle) to study dependence of nuclear
spin-dependent amplitude on the nuclear structure.

b. Theory.

It is known that parity-nonconserving
electron-nuclear interaction can be divided into two
parts: nuclear spin-independent part and nuclear spin-
dependent one. The respective PNC Hamiltonian can be
written as follows (atomic units are used throughout the
paper):

HPNC = HSI + HSD =

γ5 +

αI

ρ(r), (1)

GF
√2 (cid:16)−

QW

κ
I

(cid:17)

14 a.u.

×

10−

where GF = 2.2225
is the Fermi constant
of the weak interaction, QW is the nuclear weak charge,
κ is the dimensionless coupling constant, α = γ0γ, γi
are the Dirac matrices, I is the nuclear spin (I = 9
2
for the isotope 211Fr), and ρ(r) is the nuclear density
distribution.

As we mentioned above, there are three main contri-
butions to the coupling constant κ in the spin-dependent

part of the PNC interaction (1):

κ = (

1)I+ 1

2 −

−

l I + 1
2
I + 1

κa + κ2 + κQW ,

(2)

where the anapole contribution is given by the constant
κa [3] (l is the orbital angular momentum of the un-
paired nucleon), the constant κ2 corresponds to the spin-
dependent weak neutral currents and the term κQW is
induced by the interference of the spin-independent PNC
interaction with the hyperﬁne interaction. For heavy nu-
clei constants κa and κQW are proportional to A2/3 [5, 6],
and their ratio depends on the dimensionless constant of
the weak interaction of the unpaired nucleon with the
nuclear core g [8]:

κQW
κa ≈

where µN and µ are magnetic moments of the nucleus
and the valence nucleon, correspondingly. The numerical
factor q is within the limits 1 < q < 3 (see, e. g., [8]). For
7, while for neutron gn ≈ −
the unpaired proton gp ≈
2
[8] (see also [9]). This estimate shows that for the odd
isotopes of Fr the anapole contribution dominates in (2).
We assume that the nucleus is a uniformly charged

sphere:

ρ(r) =

Θ(rn −

The root-mean-square charge radius for 211Fr was mea-
sured to be rrms = 5.566 fm [15]. Using the relation

Eq. (9) was used in the semiempirical calculations [10,
11], but here we use the more accurate expression (8).

c. Method of calculations and results. The Dirac-
Fock-Breit equations were solved self-consistently on a ra-
dial grid for the core electrons [1s,...,6p 3
2 ]. Then, the va-
1
lence orbitals 7s, 7p, 8s, 8p, 9p were constructed in VN
−
approximation. The basis set used in calculations in-
cluded also virtual orbitals up to 25s, 25p, 24d, 15f , and
15g formed with the help of the method described in
Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19].

To ﬁnd the nuclear spin-dependent PNC amplitude de-
ﬁned by Eq. (8), one needs to sum over intermediate
states or solve the corresponding inhomogeneous equa-
tions (Sternheimer [20] or Dalgarno-Lewis [21] method).
Here we apply the Sternheimer-Dalgarno-Lewis method
to the valence part of the problem as described in [18, 22].
Solving inhomogeneous equation we ﬁnd the answer in
the Dirac-Fock approximation:

It is known that core-valence correlations usually play
an important role for the PNC amplitudes. We ﬁrst
solved the random-phase approximation (RPA) equa-
tions, summing a certain sequence of many-body dia-
grams to all orders for both operators in the right hand
side of Eq. (4). Note that after the RPA equations are
solved for the operator HSD, the MEs
2 i
are no longer equal to zero. As a result, the interme-
diate np 3
states also contribute to the spin-dependent
PNC amplitude. We found that their contribution to
7s, F = 5
is about 10%. That contri-

bution is neglected in the approximation (9). The RPA
correction changes the PNC amplitude to:

The core polarization was taken into account by many-
body perturbation theory. We completely accounted for
the second order of perturbation theory and partly for
the higher orders. In particular, we calculated the struc-
tural radiation and normalization corrections to the PNC
amplitude.

Finally, taking into account that the initial and ﬁnal
states are the many-electron states one needs to account

3

for the excitations from the npj shells (n=2–6). Respec-
tive “core” contribution to the spin-dependent amplitude
was estimated to be

It is interesting to compare this amplitude to similar
amplitudes in K and Cs. The amplitude (8) strongly
depends on the nuclear spin I, which is diﬀerent for all
alkalis. Therefore, it is convenient to rewrite it in terms
of the matrix element of the electron operator σ = 2s,
as it was done in Ref. [11]:

where we took into account the diﬀerences in deﬁnition
of the coupling constant κ [25].

One can see that the constant D for Fr is almost an
order of magnitude larger, than for Cs. According to
the Refs. [23, 24], the ratio of the spin-independent PNC
amplitudes for optical transitions ns
(n + 1)s for Fr
(n = 7) and Cs (n = 6) is close to 20. That factor
also accounts for the 1.6 times diﬀerence of the weak
charges QW in the PNC operator (1) for the two nuclei.
Because the interaction of the electron with the nuclear
AM gives the main contribution to the spin-dependent
PNC amplitude, one can expect that the constant κ also
grows as A2/3 [3]. That can account for the extra factor
1.4 for the amplitude (13) in Fr when compared to

that in Cs.

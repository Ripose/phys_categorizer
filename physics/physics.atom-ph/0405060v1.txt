Abstract

Transformation matrices of the weights of the atomic wave functions in jj coupling to the

relevant weights of LS coupling are considered for a shell of equivalent electrons. Their use
allows one to preserve main part of relativistic eﬀects but to classify the energy levels of an

atom or an ion considered with the help of a set of quantum numbers of LS coupling scheme.

Having in mind that the numerical values of the abovementioned transformation matrix (LS–jj)
may be generally obtained in a very time consuming recurrent way, the analytical expressions

of these matrices for a number of special cases of electronic conﬁgurations are presented.

Introduction

It is impossible to predict, the spectroscopic data on which chemical element (neutral atom or its

arbitrary ionization degree) will become one day urgently need. Therefore, the theoretical methods

of the studies of the structure and properties of many-electron atoms and ions must be fairly

accurate and universal.

When identifying and classifying the energy levels of atom or ion, one has to ﬁnd and use the optimal

coupling scheme of angular momenta in each open electronic shell of equivalent electrons as well as

between them. The special diﬃculties arise in the relativistic treatment of electronic conﬁgurations

when the non-relativistic shell of equivalent electrons splits into a number of subshells.

Oﬀen it is important to preserve a main part of relativistic eﬀects, but to classify the energy levels

with the help of a set of quantum numbers of LS coupling. This may be achieved making use of the

transfomation matrices of the weights of the atomic functions in jj coupling, obtained in relativistic

approximation, to the relevant weights of LS coupling. The eﬃcient method, implementing such a

procedure, is described in [1, 2]. A number of practical applications is discussed in [3].

Having in mind that numerical values of the transformation matrices from jj to LS coupling

needed may be obtained generally in very time consuming recurrent way, the possibilities to ﬁnd

the analytical expressions of such matrices for a number of special cases of electronic conﬁgurations

are discussed in this paper.

2 General consideration of the LS–jj transformation matrices for

a shell of equivalent electrons lN

The relativistic analogue of the non-relativistic wave function of a shell of lN equivalent electrons
(LS coupling)

where α denotes the additional quantum numbers necessary for the one-to-one classiﬁcation of the

energy levels of that shell, in the jj coupling splits into so-called subshells. It will look as follows:

where j1 = l

It may be used to transform the weights of the relativistic wave function in jj coupling to the rele-

vant weights of LS coupling. However, in such a case this equality becomes not completely accurate

bacause of the changes of the character of the wave functions and the Hamiltonian (non-relativistic

and relativistic). Actually a part of the relativistic eﬀects is lost after this transformation. Further
on we shall discuss the transformation matrix (φk|

The phase system of the wave functions is usually chosen in such a way that the coeﬃcients of

fractional parentage (CFP) are real numbers. Then the LS–jj transformation matrices will be

real too. In the case of orthonormal wave functions the transformation matrices will also obey the

As noticed in [6] the LS–jj transformation matrices calculated using CFP’s which satisfy the

conditions (11) and (12) are related by the following simple symmetry property:

Therefore it is usually enough to calculate using Eq. (8) only the matrix elements of partially ﬁlled

In [2] there are presented algebraic expressions for a fairly large number of particular cases of CFP.

Making use of them we could ﬁnd similar algebraic formulas for the transformation matrices under
consideration. Let us discuss the case of l3 as the example. Further on we will investigate the cases
when in one of jj subshells there is 1 electron and in other 2 electrons (we will denote this case

as N1 = 1, N2 = 2 or N1 = 2, N2 = 1) and the case when all three electrons are in one subshell
(N1 = 3 or N2 = 3).

Let us assume that j1 = l

Formulas like Eq. (16) and (20) are simplier for calculations compared to general recurrent relation

(8). We can even more simplify such formulas with the use of known algebraic expressions for

CFP’s in LS and jj couplings. Such expressions and the relevant computer code may be useful

as an independent check of more general programs for LS–jj matrix elements calculation. Similar

expressions may be found for a number of other special cases of electronic conﬁgurations, but they

are rather complicated and, therefore, of a little use.

4 Conclusion

Numerical values of the transformation matrices from jj to LS coupling scheme in general may

be found making use of the recurrent formulae of the kind (8). The relevant calculation procedure

is very time consuming, therefore the alternative ways, even if they are suitable only for some

particular cases, are of interest.

The use of analytical expressions for the coeﬃcients of fractional parentage, both in LS and jj

couplings, allowed us to obtain the comparatively simple algebraic formulas for the abovementioned

transformation matrices in the case of particular electronic conﬁgurations.

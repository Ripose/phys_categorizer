We analyse the ground state of a particle in a double-well potential, with a cylindrical symmetry,
and in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that the azimuthal quantum number m takes the
values m = 0, 1, 2 . . . when we increase the magnetic ﬁeld. At critical values of the magnetic ﬁeld,
the ground state is twice degenerate. The magnetisation shows an oscillatory behaviour and jumps
at critical values of the magnetic ﬁeld. This phase transition could be seen in the condensate of a
dilute gas of charged bosons conﬁned by a double-well potential.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is a well-known fact1 that in the absence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld the ground state of bosons is non degener-
ate, and therefore has the symmetry of the hamiltonian.
Mathematically this result from the fact that the kernel
of the operator e−tH is positive. This last property no
more holds in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld so that de-
generacy of the ground state may be expected, as well as
symmetry breaking in it. One-body systems already may
Indeed Lavine and O’Carrol2
show this phenomenon.
proved the existence of spherically symmetric potentials
for which, in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the ground
state has a non-vanishing value for the z component of
angular momentum, so that the rotational symmetry is
broken.

Further examples were provided by Avron, Herbst and
Simon3,4. On the opposite side, these last authors were
able to prove that for the hydrogen atom the symmetry
is not broken, as well as in the case where the poten-
tial is monotonically increasing with the distance. These
authors, however, mainly concerned with problems of
atomic physics, did not discuss the degeneracy and the
physical signiﬁcance of it.

On the other hand, two of us analysing the problem of
a particle conﬁned to a disc or an annulus in the pres-
ence of a magnetic ﬁeld found that the ground state was
degenerate in the case of an annulus and for a disc with
Neumann boundary conditions (with Dirichtlet boundary
conditions in the disc case the degeneracy disappears.)
The degeneracy appears each time the magnetic ﬁeld
reaches a critical value and the magnetisation jumps at
these critical values, which form a discrete set5.

Motivated by these results we consider in this arti-
cle a class of systems for which similar phenomena oc-
cur. Namely we analyse the ground state of a particle
in three dimensions moving in a double-well type poten-
tial, cylindrically symmetric, and submitted to a constant
magnetic ﬁeld in the z direction.

We ﬁnd that the ground state has an azimuthal mo-
mentum ¯hm taking increasing values m = 0, 1, 2, ... when
we increase the magnetic ﬁeld B. At critical values of B
(Bm) the ground state is twice degenerate between the m
and the m + 1 state. Moreover the magnetisation jumps
at these critical values and shows in general an oscilla-
tory behaviour reminiscent of the well known de Haas
von Halphen oscillations in solid state physics.

We show that this phenomenon can be understood by
an analysis of the minima of the potential energy, ﬁxing
however the angular momentum to its quantised value
¯hm. In the two-dimensional case we can use the WKB
method and obtain bounds on the energy in order to
estimate the critical ﬁelds. But in general, we had to
compute numerically the energies and compare them to
estimates based on trial wave functions. The agreement
is quite good in general.

Concerning possible experimental veriﬁcations of these
eﬀects, which require basically to have a potential which
has a minimum suﬃciently far from the origin, we could
think of two cases. The ﬁrst one would be in some
molecules where proton dynamics could be described
by such an eﬀective potential. The second one, more
thrilling, would be the case of charged bosons undertak-
ing a Bose-Einstein condensation. Our results suggest
that in this case, the bosons would undertake a phase
transition in their condensate, when we apply an in-
creasing magnetic ﬁeld. This phase transition would
manifest itself by appearance of oscillations in the mag-
netisation, which would jump at certain critical values
of the magnetic ﬁeld.

II. THE MODEL

We will consider the case of a particle of mass µ, charge
q, in a potential V with a cylindrical symmetry, submit-

ted to a magnetic ﬁeld eB in the z direction. We do not

consider the eﬀect of the spin of the particle. We choose

1

for a unit of energy V0, and length r0, both being charac-
teristic of the potential. The dimensionless hamiltonian

reads if r =px2 + y2

(i ǫ ~∇ − ~A)2 + V (r, z)

where

ǫ =

r0√2µV0

measures the importance of the quantum eﬀects and the
vector potential in the symmetric gauge is given by

~A = (cid:0)−By

B =

r0√2µV0 eB being the dimensionless magnetic ﬁeld.

Thanks to the cylindrical symmetry, we can replace
the z component of the angular momentum Lz by its
eigenvalue ǫm so that the reduced hamiltonian reads

(4)

The ground state energy of this hamiltonian and the cor-
responding eigenfunction will be denoted Em and ψm.

It remains to specify V . We will basically consider a

double-well potential of the form:

V (r, z) = r4 + z4 − 2(r2 + z2) + v r2z2

(5)

with v satisfying v ≥ −2, so that V is bounded from
below. If v is equal to 0 we can decouple the motion in
the z direction form the one in the plane perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is what we will call the two-
dimensional case. If v = 2, we have in three dimensions
a potential with spherical symmetry.

We have chosen this double-well form because if we had
taken the simple well V = r4 + z4 + 2(r2 + z2) + v r2z2
with v ≥ 0 it follows from3 that the ground state is not
degenerate and corresponds to m = 0.

the ground state energy of Hm given in (4), so that the
real ground state energy is given by

E = inf

(10)

since obviously negative m give a larger energy.

Finally we will use the following useful scaling property

of the energy em

is the parameter multiplying r2 in the potential. Equa-
tion (11) follows simply from the scaling transformation
: r2 → sr2 and z2 → sz2. This relation shows that we
have eﬀectively a two parameter dependence of the en-
ergy em in general and a one parameter dependence in
the two dimensional case.

The choice s = |λ| or s = m

3 (m ≥ 1) shows that
large magnetic ﬁeld or large angular momenta correspond
to the semi-classical limit. In fact we shall see that in
the classical limit ǫ → 0 ground state with m 6= 0 are
favoured inducing ground state degeneracies at some val-
ues of the magnetic ﬁeld. It thus appears that the ten-
dency to have a ground state with the same symmetry as
the hamiltonian and therefore non degenerate is an eﬀect
due to quantum mechanics.

III. THE CLASSICAL LIMIT

One can gain some qualitative understanding of the
problem by looking at the classical limit of it. This means
that we neglect the quantum kinetic energy and deﬁne
the ground state energy as

E = inf
m≥0

inf
(r,z)

[Vm(r, z) − ǫmB]

(13)

where

Vm =

(ǫm)2
r2 + r4 + z4 +

B2
4

r2 − 2r2 + v r2z2

(14)

and consider that m is an integer.

Two cases need to be considered separately:

|v| < 2
and v ≥ 2. If |v| < 2 we denote by xm and tm respectively
the values of r2 and z2 which minimise the potential Vm,
and we ﬁnd

v xm

(cid:18)2 −

(15)

Once again this general behaviour is reproduced by
the numerical results in the quantum case and the spac-
ing between the values of the critical ﬁeld is rather well
represented by formula (20) when m ≥ 1. In the two-
dimensional case, i.e. v = 0 and neglecting the trivial
z dependence, we can proceed further and look at a re-
ally semi-classical approximation namely WKB, for the
ground state energy

Z r+

r−

drpem − Vm(r) =

ǫ π
2

(24)

where

B2

(ǫm)2

Vm(r) =

r2 + r4 +(cid:0) − 2 +

4 (cid:1)r2
and the ground state energy is Em = em − ǫmB.
In fact this WKB approximation will give the best an-
alytical results, apart from the variational estimates for
the energy, which give unfortunately only exact upper
bounds on the energy.

(25)

When the potential has spherical symmetry v = 2,
quantum eﬀects are much more important and the clas-
sical analysis gives only that the ground state has m = 0
if B < 2ǫ, is degenerate between m = 0 and m = 1 when
2ǫ ≤ B < 4ǫ, has possibly m = 0, 1, 2 for 4ǫ ≤ B < 6ǫ
and so on. This only suggests that we have again the
increasing sequence of m, when we increase the magnetic
ﬁeld and that critical values appear near 2ǫm.

When v > 2, we ﬁnd that m = 0 is the ground
state except when B = 2ǫm, where it is degenerate be-
tween m and 0. We may note however that the classical
ground state correspond to points (r = 0, z = ±1) in
conﬁguration space for m = 0, whereas it corresponds
to two circles (r = ǫ
2B ) for m = 1 and
2ǫ < B < 4ǫ, so that the wave function can be more
spread in the m = 1 state than the in the m = 0 state,
and that the kinetic energy of the m = 1 state is lower,
favouring the m = 1 state. Hence we should expect, at
least when ǫ is small, a ground state with m = 0 for small
ﬁelds and a ground state with m = 1, when 2ǫ < B < 4ǫ.
A similar argument can be given for the higher values of
m.

2B , z = ±p1 − ǫ

Finally, it is worth noticing that if we had taken a

simple well type potential

]

(22)

V (r, z) = r4 + z4 + 2(r2 + z2) + v r2z2

(26)

the classical analysis gives a ground state with m = 0, at
least when v ≥ −1. This is a correct result when v ≥ 0
at the quantum level.

On the other hand, considering for a while m as a con-
tinuous variable, the absolute minimum of Vm − ǫmB is
given by

ǫ ˆm =

B
2

x ˆm

(16)

From (15) this gives an absolute minimum of Vm − ǫmB
given by

and therefore

x ˆm = t ˆm =

1

1 + v
2

ǫ ˆm =

B
2

1

1 + v
2

(17)

(18)

In considering the variable m as a continuous one we
have treated the problem purely classically and the cor-
responding ”ground state” energy is

Ecl = −

2

1 + v
2

(19)

We know that m is a discrete variable but for consistency
we must consider ǫ as a small number. Then if m des-
ignates the integer part of ˆm, we have ˆm = m + θ and
if 0 ≤ θ < 1
2 , the ground state has the quantum number
m, whereas if 1

2 < θ ≤ 1 it has m + 1.

From this analysis we conclude that if Bm−1 < B <

Bm where

Bm = ǫ(1 +

v
2

)(2m + 1)

(20)

the ground state has the quantum number m. Hence we
see that by increasing the magnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd in in-
creasing order the values of m = 0, 1, 2, ... and an inﬁnite
set of critical values of the magnetic ﬁeld exist, Bm
for which the ground state is twice degenerate, being
both m and m + 1.
This picture is entirely conﬁrmed by the numerical re-
sults in the quantum case. It is also quite interesting to
look at the magnetisation. In the state whose quantum
number is m, we have

Mm = ǫm −

This shows that the magnetisation has an ”oscillatory”
type of behaviour reminiscent of the familiar de Haas von
Halphen one in solid state physics and that the magneti-
sation jumps at the critical values of the magnetic
ﬁeld, the jump being given by

∆Mm = ǫ

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND VARIATIONAL

BOUNDS

It is quite useful to undertake a numerical analysis of
this problem. We have used a ﬁnite element method,
choosing for the basis a product of two triangles func-
tions. We discuss separately the two-dimensional prob-
lem and the three dimensional ones.

A. Two dimensions

We ﬁrst give pictures of the ground state energy for
two typical values of ǫ, a small (ǫ = 0.03) and a large one
(ǫ = 0.5) as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld B. (ﬁgure
1). The cusps at the critical values of B indicate a jump
of the corresponding magnetisation.

We can also note that when B becomes large the mag-
netisation tends to −ǫ, its value in the Landau regime.
The results clearly indicate that we go progressively
from the states with m = 0, 1, 2 . . . by increasing the
magnetic ﬁeld and that the magnetisation jumps at the
critical values. The eﬀect is more pronounced in the clas-
sical regime. All these results are in qualitative argument
with the classical picture presented before and the agree-
ment is even quantitative when ǫ = 0.03 for example.

The jumps of the magnetisation given by formula (22)
are reproduced (ﬁgure 2) with a precision of less than
1 percent when ǫ = 0.03, and the spacing between the
critical values of the magnetic ﬁeld

(27)

is given by ∆m ≤ 0.04 if m ≥ 1 and ǫ = 0.1. ∆m de-
creases when m increases in agreement with the scaling
relation Bm = (2m + 1)ǫ, so that the simple classical for-
mula reproduces rather well the results. By contrast, the
jump between the m = 0 and the m = 1 state is largely of
quantum mechanical origin, as well as the precise values
of the critical ﬁelds.

It is also interesting to look at the eigenfunctions when
the magnetic ﬁeld reaches its critical value. In ﬁgure 4
we give pictures of them at the critical value between the
state m = 0 and m = 1 when ǫ = 0.2. We see that
their maxima are located very near the minimum of the
potential.

Finally we compare the results with two theoretical
estimates: ﬁrst of all the WKB one, and a variational
one. This last estimate is based on the following two
parameters trial wave function

ψm = rm e−αr2−β(r−1)2

(28)

The variational upper bound on the energy can be ex-
pressed in terms of Weber cylindrical functions, but we
directly computed the corresponding integrals.

FIG. 5. Energie and magnetisation dependence of B for

ǫ = 0.03 and ǫ = 0.5

Once again we see that the values of m in the ground
state increases with B, and that the magnetisation jumps
at critical values Bm of the magnetic ﬁeld, where the
ground state is doubly degenerate. These results are in
qualitative agreement with the classical analysis. Figure
6 summaries the results in the ǫ - B plane. Notice that

Obviously there is a very good agreement, since the
largest error for Bm is less than 2% and for Em less than
0.7%. Table VI gives the same but for ǫ = 0.5. Again
we see a good agreement (error less than 5%). When
ǫ increases we found that α increases and β decreases
as well as ζ and our trial wave function becomes less
accurate, because the double-well nature of the potential
is less important compared to the kinetic energy.

V. BOUNDS ON THE CRITICAL FIELD IN THE

TWO DIMENSIONAL CASE

One might desire to get rigorous upper and lower
bounds on the critical ﬁelds. One possible approach
would consist in getting upper and lower bounds on the
ground state energies Em. Whereas we have seen that
one can obtain very good variational upper bounds, it is
rather diﬃcult to get good lower ones. In order to test
these results, we analysed only the two-dimensional case.
First we want to obtain conditions under which m = 0

is the ground state. Using the inequality

FIG. 7. M values of the ground state depending on B and

Figure 7 describes the situation in the v - B plane for
m = 0, 1, . . . , 10 and diﬀerent values of ǫ. We notice that
when v is less than 2 and ǫ is not too large (ǫ ≤ 0.2),
the situation is similar to the one already discussed, but
that there is an abrupt change at v = 2 when ǫ is small
in agreement with the classical analysis. However when
ǫ > 0.2 the ground state m = 0 is deﬁnitely favoured as
v increases.

Figure 8 shows the energies for the ﬁrst ﬁve m values
computed with three diﬀerent v: two-dimensional (v =
0), spherical potential (v = 2), and v = 3. We can see a
new crossing between the m = 0 and the other m levels
when v becomes larger than 2, although this does not
concern the ground state.

In the estimate for δ we can use our best variational
upper bound. Inequality (37) will be satisﬁed if B is less
than some value B0, so that in this range m = 0 is the
ground state. In order to see when m 6= 0 is a ground
state, we use the following trial wave function ψ(r) for a
state with angular momentum m′.

ψ(r) = rm′−m ψm(r)

m′ ≥ m

(38)

where ψm(r) is the exact ground state wave function for
the state with angular momentum m. An integration by

which is satisfactory when B is not too large, but which
becomes negative for large B. We can repair this by
using the fact3 that if f is an increasing function of r,
its expectation value in the ground state is lowered by
adding to the potential a new increasing potential. We
can ﬁnd a useful comparison potential

W = a1r2 + a2r4 + a3r6 ≥ V

which has a ground state wave function of the form

ψ = eb1r2−b2r4

b2 > 0

(47)

(48)

so that hr2iW can be computed explicitly for this poten-
tial and we can take c = hr2iW in equation (45), which
gives a more satisfactory result for large B.

In any case we see that the state m = 1 if favoured over
the state m = 0 if B is larger than some value, and by
continuity there must exist a ﬁeld for which both states
have equal energy. But in order to prove that the ground
state is m = 1 when B is in some range requires to show
that Em > E1 ∀m ≥ 2. For this purpose let us consider
m as a continuous parameter. Then

Noting that equation (51) implies that

(54) that Em ≥ E1 for all m ≥ 2 if

They show that whereas the range of values of B for
which E0 < E1 and E1 < E0 is reasonably estimated
for ǫ <
∼ 0.1, there is no range of values of B for which
our bounds show that m = 1 is the ground state except
when ǫ is very small (0.01) But in this range WKB works
perfectly well. Obviously we have too poorly estimated
the eﬀect of the kinetic energy and that of the centrifugal
barrier. Numerical computations for example show that
the replacement of h 1
is not appropriate when
ǫ or B are too large.

In conclusion, even in two dimensions improved rigor-
ous bounds on the critical values of the magnetic ﬁeld
are needed, and the WKB method for which we have no
estimate of the error gives the best analytic results.

VI. CONCLUSION

It could be of course quite interesting to see an ex-
perimental veriﬁcation of these surprising eﬀects of the
magnetic ﬁeld. Even though we have found them in the
case of a double-well, we think that the details of the
potential do not matter too much. What is needed is a
potential whose minimum is taken suﬃciently far from
the origin.

We have thought of two possible ﬁelds where one could
observe such eﬀects. The ﬁrst one is molecular physics
where often the dynamics of electrons or protons is mod-
elled by the motion of a quantum particle in a double-well
(although admittedly often a one-dimensional one.) If we
consider the case of the electron in the rotationally sym-
metric double-well, the smallest value of the critical ﬁeld
where the m = 1 and m = 0 states are degenerate is
about 15 Tesla if we take for the depth of the potential
1 eV and for the distance to the origin of the minimum
2 ˚A. For protons the situation is more favourable since a
ﬁeld of 5 Tesla can create a degeneracy when the depth
is kept to 1 eV and the minimum is at a distance of 1.5
˚A. Obviously a more detailed investigation is needed if
one wants to see these unusual eﬀects (like a change from
diamagnietism to paramagnetism) in molecules.

The other ﬁeld is that of Bose-Einstein condensates
of very cold atoms, which recently has made spectac-

magnetic ﬁeld and in a potential V ( r
) one can show
r0
that there is a Bose-Einstein condensation in the ground
state in three dimensions, in the limit r0 going to inﬁnity,
for all potentials which have a quadratic dependence of
r near the origin. Our result supports therefore that free
charged bosons in their condensate would show a phase
transition when one varies the magnetic ﬁeld. This tran-
sition would manifest itself by jumps of the magnetisa-
tion at some critical values of the magnetic ﬁeld. The
phenomenon would probably persist in a dilute gas of
charged bosons in a neutralising background. It is how-
ever probably quite diﬃcult to create such a jellium in
the laboratory and this remains a challenging task.

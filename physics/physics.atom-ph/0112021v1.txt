We develop a versatile theoretical approach to the study of ultracold atom diﬀractive scattering
from light-ﬁeld gratings by combining calculations of the optical near ﬁeld generated by evanescent
waves close to the surface of periodic nanostructured arrays together with advanced atom wavepacket
propagation techniques. Nanometric 1-D and 2-D arrays with subwavelength periodicity deposited
on a transparent surface and optically coupled to an evanescent wave source exhibit intensity and
polarisation gradients on the length scale of the object and can produce strong near-ﬁeld periodic
modulation in the optical potential above the structure. As a speciﬁc and experimentally practical
example we calculate the diﬀraction of cold Cs atoms dropped onto a periodic optical potential
crafted from a 2-D nanostructure array. For an ”out of plane” conﬁguration we calculate a wide
diﬀraction angle(≃ 2 degrees) and about 60% of the initial atom ﬂux in diﬀraction orders ±1, an
encouraging result for future experiments.

INTRODUCTION

The prospect of manipulating neutral atoms and
molecules by light forces acting at nanometer scale
fascinating but experimentally chal-
lengths oﬀers
lenging possibilities in many areas of atomic physics.
Atom optics [1], atom nanolithography [2, 3], and atom
interferometry [1] are prime examples.
The use of
high-refractive-index dielectric or metallic nanometric
objects to produce subwavelength localized light ﬁeld
distributions [4, 5, 6] raises the possibility of ”inte-
grated atom optics” in which atoms or molecules can
be conﬁned, guided or diﬀracted above nanostruc-
tured surfaces fabricated to a designed shape [7, 8, 9].
for atom control, and
Tailoring optical potentials
possibly Bose-Einstein condensates,
is analogous to
the use of micromagnetic ﬁelds for a similar pur-
pose [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Atom diﬀraction
from a transmission optical grating provided one of the
early examples of
light-ﬁeld atom manipulation [19].
A proposal for [20] and realization of [21] a reﬂection
light-ﬁeld grating quickly followed. These early de-
velopments stimulated many subsequent experimental
and theoretical studies, and a pertinent review has
recently appeared [22]. Until now reﬂection gratings for
matter waves have been implemented by the formation

of one dimensional evanescent standing waves produced
by counterpropagating laser beams undergoing total
internal reﬂection through a glass prism.

The approach we present here contrasts markedly
with this earlier work on standing waves of sinusoidal
form. We study diﬀractive scattering of cold atoms
from an evanescent ﬁeld, spatially modulated by an
array of nanometric objects with high index of re-
fraction and subwavelength periodicity deposited on
a glass surface [23, 24]. These evanescent ﬁelds and
their interaction with atoms will exhibit several novel
features. First, rather than a pure sinusoidal evanescent
standing wave, nanostructured periodic corrugation
generates ﬁelds containing higher-order harmonics and
an intricate polarization distribution. Second, spatial
gradients of ﬁeld intensity and polarization at length
scales well below the diﬀraction limit interact with the
external and internal atomic degrees of freedom in ways
that strongly depend on the geometry and material of
the nanostructures employed. Third, the intensity and
polarization map above the nanostructure array also
depends strongly on the intensity and polarization of
the exciting light source.

Since the cold-atom de Broglie wavelength is not much

The periodic optical near-ﬁeld above the nanostructured array

of high-refractive-index material with subwavelength dimen-
sions and periodicity (see text for model details). Note that
the incident plane of the light PL is along the diagonal of the
cubes while the incident plane of the atoms PA is shifted 45
degrees and parallel to the cube edges. Note also that the
diﬀracted orders k±1 are ”out-of-plane” with respect to the
plane of incidence of the light.

smaller than the characteristic scale length of the optical
ﬁeld, an accurate description of atomic motion calls for
a quantum treatment of external as well as internal
degrees of freedom. In order to analyze the dynamics of
cold atoms scattering oﬀ periodic optical potentials we
need to marry two well-developed numerical techniques:
calculation of the optical near-ﬁeld and atom wave
packet propagation. The situation we consider is shown
in Fig. 1. First, we calculate the three-dimensional elec-
tric ﬁeld and polarization distribution in the near ﬁeld
surrounding the nanostructures. At frequency detunings
far from resonance, where absorption is negligible,
this information is used to construct a conservative
potential for a full three-dimensional treatment of the
center-of-mass motion of the atom,
including ground
internal states. Using the light ﬁeld information above
the nanostructures, we calculate the three-dimensional
atom-ﬁeld interaction potential [22, 29, 30]. Since the
ﬁeld polarization will vary signiﬁcantly over the length
scale of the nanostructures [28], and since various ﬁeld
polarizations may lead to population transfer among
atomic internal states [22], we include the internal
Zeeman states of a 2S1/2 atomic ground level in the
calculation of the atom-optical ﬁeld scattering. Second,
we apply a time-dependent wave packet method to
describe the scattering problem of cold atoms diﬀracting

2

from an optical grating with subwavelength periodicity.
Inclusion of the ground-level internal states leads to a
three-dimensional, coupled channel problem that we
solve with wave packet propagation techniques already
successfully applied to atom or molecule surface scatter-
ing and quantum molecular dynamics in several degrees
of freedom [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41].
After the wave packet representing the atom reﬂects and
diﬀracts from the optical potential, it is projected onto
ﬁnal scattering states to yield the desired diﬀraction
probabilities [38].

In this paper we emphasize general principles and
seek to establish a methodology without restriction to
any speciﬁc experimental set-up. In fact the numerical
solution of Maxwell’s equations in the near ﬁeld and
Schroedinger’s equation for the atomic motion can
easily be adapted to explore atom manipulation in
sub-wavelength optical light ﬁelds of arbitrary geometry.
However to illustrate this methodology we present
calculations obtained with realistic parameters corre-
sponding to an experiment using a ﬂux of cold 2S1/2
atoms incident at about 40 degrees from the normal and
scattering oﬀ a two-dimensional optical grating with
subwavelength period. The results of our calculation
yields out-of-plane diﬀraction into a few orders, with
markedly large diﬀraction angles.
The results are
encouraging for planned experiments.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
II gives details of the calculation of the scattering prob-
abilities. The sub-wavelength light ﬁeld calculations are
reported elsewhere [28], so only the essential steps are
summarized here. In Section III we present a model con-
ﬁguration and in Section IV we show the numerical re-
sults for illustration.

II. THEORY

A. The optical near ﬁeld

The evanescent wave ﬁeld created by the totally inter-
nally reﬂected laser beam is strongly modiﬁed by the pe-
riodic nanostructures on the glass substrate surface. The
calculation of this intricate electric vector ﬁeld above the
nanostructures can be carried out using several methods
that solve Maxwell’s equations in these nontrivial geome-
tries. These methods are well established in the ﬁeld
of scanning near-ﬁeld optical microscopy (SNOM) [4, 6].
Among the most widely used are the ﬁnite-diﬀerences
scheme [44], the diﬀerential theory of gratings (DTG)
([25, 26, 27]) and the Green’s function method[4]. This
latter approach is well–adapted to study single, ﬁnite–
size nano–objects, and has been used extensively to study
a wide range of nanostructures [45, 46]. However, in the
case of periodic surface structures, it becomes ineﬃcient,
since it does not explicitly take the periodicity into ac-

count. In such cases, the DTG method is more appropri-
ate, because it solves Maxwell’s equations by means of a
Fourier expansion of each ﬁeld component.

To be more speciﬁc, we deﬁne r = (x, y, z) with z taken
as the direction perpendicular to the surface. For conve-
nience, we deﬁne a vector l = (x, y) in the plane of the
substrate surface. We will denote the electric ﬁeld by 1
in the glass half-space and by 2 in the vacuum half-space,
n1 being the glass index and n2 the vacuum index. The
two-dimensional periodicity of the nanostructures deﬁnes
a unit cell of length Lx and Ly along the x and y direc-
tions, respectively. The direction of the incoming laser is
L, ky
given by (kx
L), with kL = n12π/λo, λ0 being the
laser wavelength in vacuum.

In the DTG method, an index-modulated zone, la-
belled 3 and characterized by n3(r), the high index ma-
terial, is introduced at the vacuum/glass substrate in-
terface. We have then to solve in all space Helmoltz’s

for which we have two solutions, corresponding to “ris-
ing” and “descending” waves. The rising zero order in
the glass substrate corresponds to the incident laser ﬁeld.
Then, if we know the Fourier components Emn and Bmn
of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld in a plane just above
the nano–objects, the ﬁeld distribution anywhere above
the structures are determined by Eqs. 1,2. From Eq. 3,
it may be seen that the coeﬃcient γmn is either real or
purely imaginary. The real values of γmn correspond
to radiative harmonics while imaginary values introduce
evanescent components.

The six components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
E(l)(r), B(l)(r) are then deduced from two indepen-
dent parameters, usually named the principal compo-
nents, which in the present case are chosen to be the
y–components E(l)y(r) and B(l)y(r).
In order to cal-
culate the Fourier components of the electric ﬁeld just
above the nanostructures, we have to solve a system of
linear diﬀerential equations for E(l)y(r) and B(l)y(r) in
the region of space where the index is modulated by the
nanostructures. This system mixes all the Fourier orders
of the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld through the product
3 E(3)y(r) in Helmholtz’s equation. Then, for numeri-
n 2
cal applications the Fourier expansion converges at some
suﬃciently large value N , i.e. the order n and m will
both vary from −N to +N . We solve this system using
standard bounding conditions for this problem, i.e. we
assume there is no ﬁeld arriving from inﬁnity in the vac-
uum, and the only Fourier components of the incident
ﬁeld in the glass substrate are those of zero-order. Fi-
nally, we can express the Fourier components E(2)y
mn and
B(2)y
mn in a horizontal plane just above the nano-objects as
a linear combination of the y-components of the incident
ﬁelds, Ei,Bi, which deﬁne the polarization state of the
incoming laser :

These transmission coeﬃcients, T EE

frequency and the angle of incidence of the illuminating

Fig. 2. A more detailed description of this calculation
can be found in Refs.[25, 27]. With the optical ﬁeld
mapping in hand we turn our attention to atom scatter-
ing in the presence of these ﬁelds.

B. Calculation of atom-surface scattering

In the limit of low saturation and a blue detuning δ
which is large compared to the Doppler shift and natu-
ral linewidth, the atom-ﬁeld interaction can be treated
within the framework of coherent atomic motion where
spontaneous emission is neglected [22, 29, 30]. We will
consider an atom transition dipole, typical of the ﬁrst
alkali 2S1/2 → P transition, neglecting ﬁne and hyper-
ﬁne structure in the excited state, but including the two-
component angular momentum degeneracy of the ground
state. The excited level can be eliminated adiabatically,
which results in atomic motion that is described by a two-
component, three-dimensional wavepacket that evolves

on the ground-state manifold of the Zeeman sublevels
[22, 29, 30]:

In this expression the terms in parenthesis are Clebsch-
Gordan coeﬃcients with jg and je being the total an-
gular momentum of the ground and excited state re-
spectively. The reduced dipole moment is denoted by
d and the ﬁeld enters through its spherical components
Eq(r),
q = 0, ±1. This expression forms the basis
of numerous studies of atomic diﬀraction from stand-
ing evanescent waves as has been used by many authors
[8, 22, 29, 30, 43]. In general the polarization state of
the electric ﬁeld above the nanostructured objects is a
very complicated function of space. Hence, according to
Eqs. 6, 8, transitions between the diﬀerent Zeeman sub-
levels can occur during the interaction of the atom with
the light ﬁelds. As a consequence, we performed the col-
lision on the coupled ground state levels.

One way of proceeding is to expand the wavefunction
into plane waves parallel to the surface which results in a
set of coupled diﬀraction channels for the direction per-
pendicular to the surface [22]. Diﬀraction then occurs as
transitions between these diﬀractive states, the probabil-
ities of which can be calculated by a semi-classical treat-
ment within the Landau-Zener theory,[22] or by numer-
ical wave packet propagation [43]. This treatment cor-
responds to the well-known CCWP (close-coupling wave
packet) method used in standard atom or molecule sur-
face scattering [42]. However, with increasing diﬀraction
orders one may need to take a large number of diﬀrac-
tive states into account, together with all the coupling
matrix elements among them. In fact it is only recently
that modern and very eﬃcient numerical wave packet
propagation techniques have permitted the calculation
of diﬀractive scattering by solving Eq. 6 directly on grids
in real space [31, 39, 40]. Brieﬂy, one simulates the col-
lisional process by a wave packet propagation from the
initial state to the ﬁnal interaction–free zone, where it is

projected onto any desired observable, which in our case
is the total population in the diﬀerent diﬀraction chan-
nels. To achieve a good energy resolution, one needs to
construct an initial wave packet that is suﬃciently large
such that its energy width is negligible. From a numer-
ical point of view, this is very disadvantageous, since it
requires a large grid in the direction perpendicular to
the surface. Therefore, we used a method proposed by
Mowrey and Kouri [42], who started with a spatially nar-
row wave packet that comprised a wide range of energies,
and extracted energetically resolved results by projecting
onto asymptotic states of well-deﬁned energy, E.

The initial state of the atom is taken to to be a speciﬁc

This form of symmetric splitting is correct through
second order; it is unitary by construction and thus en-
sures numerical stability [48, 49]. The operator acts on
the two-component wavefunction to perform a short-time
propagation from time t to t + ∆t. The action of the ki-
netic operator is calculated in Fourier space, where it is
a simple multiplication with a phase factor, and so ev-
ery time step the two components of the wavefunctions

need to be Fourier transformed which can be done very
eﬃciently with three-dimensional FFT algorithms. With
this technique, the initial wavepacket Eq.(9) is propa-
gated until it is entirely in the asymptotic region. From
which distance the wavepacket can be considered to be ef-
fectively free has to be checked carefully since it depends
on many parameters. This is especially important in the
ﬁeld of cold collisions where low energies are considered.

Even though not applied in the current approach, we
note that the numerical eﬀort can still be reduced by an
adiabatic correction of the initial state [39, 40, 50], an-
alyzing the ﬂux out of the scattering region instead of
projecting onto ﬁnal diﬀractive states [50, 51] or using a
ﬁlter-diagonalization scheme [52].

III. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

A. Model Conﬁguration

We model a typical experimental setup with a regular
square lattice of TiO2 cubes (100 nm on a side, index
of refraction n = 2.1) deposited onto a ﬂat silica surface
(index of refraction n = 1.5) at a center-to-center dis-
tance of 250 nm (Figs. 1,3,4). These structures are illu-
minated by an evanescent light ﬁeld created by an incom-
ing laser with a vacuum wavelength of 850 nm, intensity
of 80 W/cm2, and subject to total internal reﬂection.
The plane of incidence of the laser beam (denoted kk
00
in Figs. 1,3)is chosen to be diagonal with respect to the
rectangular nanostructured pattern, and its polarization
is taken to be within the plane of incidence (TM polariza-
tion). The angle of incidence with respect to the surface
normal was chosen to be 60 degrees. Under these condi-
tions, the ﬂat surface without the nanostructures would
give rise to an evanescent wave with a decay length γ00 of
about 170 nm, and the atoms would not approach closer
than about 200 nm to the surface. Hence the inﬂuence
of the attractive van der Waals atom-surface potential
can be neglected. For diﬀerent parameters however, it
might become important [47], and can easily be included
in Eqs. 6,8. The Fourier decomposition Eq. 1 required
N = 10 terms for convergence.

B. Diﬀractive scattering

We have chosen a model atom with ground state 2S1/2,
the mass of atomic Cs, and transition dipole moment cor-
responding to the 6 2S1/2 → 6 2P3/2 atomic Cs transition.
The initial internal state was taken to be mj = −1/2
and the initial Gaussian distribution of the perpendicu-
z = 0.87 nm−1 with a
lar motion was centered around ki
width parameter ξ = 5.00 nm. The inital transverse mo-
mentum is taken to be ki
y = 0.0. This
corresponds approximately to cold Cs atoms produced in
a MOT after a free fall of about 1.5 cm before colliding
with the nanostructured surface inclined at an angle of
about 40 degrees between the vertical axis and the sur-
face normal. Under these conditions, the incoming and
specular direction are in the y = 0 plane, as indicated in
Fig. 1. We found converged results for a cut-oﬀ distance
of about 600 nm. The asymptotic wavefunction is then
analysed to yield the diﬀraction probabilities Pmn(E) as
outlined in the previous section. In all calculations, grids

IV. RESULTS

A. Sub-wavelength optical near-ﬁeld

In Fig. 3 we show the geometry of the TiO2 cubes (a)
together with the intensity distribution (b) at a distance
of 125 nm above the surface. The arrow indicating the
plane of incidence of the laser beam is denoted by kk
00 and
plane of incidence of the atoms by ki. One can clearly
see that the light ﬁelds bear the periodicity of the nanos-
tructures. We found that illuminating the nanostruc-
tures with the plane of laser incidence aligned along the
cube diagonals rather than along the sides yields peri-
odic potentials with steeper gradients (more pronounced
localization) even at distances far above the surface. At
the illustrated distance of 125 nm above the surface,
we still ﬁnd pronounced periodic ﬁeld intensity modu-
lation. This strong localization of light intensity above
high-refractive-index structures is a well-known charac-
teristic of the TM illumination mode. It has been the-
oretically modelled and experimentally veriﬁed by the
SNOM technique for a number of nanostructured ob-

the contrast diminishes with distance, the periodicity re-
mains the same; and that even if the atoms are diﬀracted
at large distances from the surface, the diﬀraction angle
will still be controlled by the ratio of the atom de Broglie
wavelength to the optical grating period. In order to rig-
orously establish the optical potential that governs the
atomic motion, we need the full information of the ﬁeld
above the surface, i.e. the three spherical components of
the electric ﬁeld E+, E− and E0, as can be seen from Eq.
8. The quantization axis was chosen to be perpendicu-
lar to the plane of laser incidence. From Fig. 5 one can
see that the diﬀerent components of the light ﬁelds are a
complicated function of space that will interact with the
multi-level internal structure of the colliding atom. Note
that the E0 component is one order of magnitude smaller
than E+ or E−.

B. Diﬀraction probabilities including ground state
degeneracy

In this section, we show the results for diﬀractive scat-
tering, using the light ﬁeld parameters as detailed in
the previous section. We stress that these probabilities
are calculated using the Cs 6 2S1/2 → 6 2P3/2 transition
dipole and atomic mass, but that no other speciﬁc atomic
parameters were used. This particle is still a model atom,
however, since we have ignored hyperﬁne structure in the
ground and excited states. The center-of-mass motion is
treated entirely quantum mechanically, and the polar-
ization state of the electric ﬁeld with its spatial varia-
tion rigorously included in the calculations. Since we are
considering a 2-D potential surface, the diﬀraction takes
place in two spatial directions labelled Gmn, which are
the reciprocal lattice vectors corresponding to the x− and
y− directions, respectively. The probability P (m, n) to
diﬀract into a given order (m, n) as a function of energy
is given by Eq. 12. Figure 6 plots these diﬀraction prob-
abilities P (m, 0) (top panel) and P (0, n) (bottom panel)
as a function of total energy. The symmetrical results for
negative values of m, n are not shown for clarity. With
the deﬁnitions employed (m, 0) corresponds to diﬀraction
within the plane of incidence of the atoms while (0, n)
corresponds to diﬀraction perpendicular to this plane.
These two cases will be called ’in- plane’ and ’out-of-
plane’ diﬀraction, respectively. Comparing the top and
bottom panels of Fig. 6, we see that probabilities for in-
plane and out-of-plane diﬀraction diﬀer dramatically.

The top panel of Fig. 6 shows the in-plane diﬀraction
probability as a function of energy for ﬁxed initial trans-
i = 0.73 nm−1. For low energies,
verse momentum of kx
we ﬁnd negligible diﬀraction. Most of the ﬁnal popu-
lation is in the (0,0) channel which represents specular
reﬂection. As the energy E increases, P (0, 0) decreases
and falls oﬀ to almost zero for energies greater than 2.5
mK (E = kBT ). The higher orders of in-plane diﬀraction
P (m, 0), m = ±1, ±2, ±3,.. are not signiﬁcantly popu-
lated either. The bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows where
the scattering ﬂux has gone. Almost the entire popula-
tion is found in the out-of-plane diﬀraction orders (0, n),
n = ±1, ±2, ±3. The fact that we calculate a rapidly
decreasing in-plane diﬀraction corresponds to the well-
known averaging of the transverse scattering amplitude
of the atomic motion parallel the diﬀracting structures
[22]. With our parameters, we ﬁnd an interaction time
of about 3 µsec, which together with the initial trans-
i = 0.73 nm−1 implies that the
verse momentum of kx
atoms ”sample” the modulated potential over a trans-
verse distance of about 800 nm, greater than the peri-
odicity of the potential by more than a factor of three.
For the out-of-plane scattering there is no such averag-
ing and the situation is analogous to in-plane diﬀraction
It is worthwhile noting that this

out-of-plane diﬀraction at grazing incidence (in a quite
diﬀerent experimental arrangement than the one envis-
aged here) has been observed experimentally [53].

collision energy (mK)

FIG. 6: Upper panel: In-plane diﬀraction probability P (m, 0)
(the plane containing ki), Lower panel: Out-of-plane diﬀrac-
tion probability P (0, n) (perpendicular to the plane contain-
ing ki), as a function of total collision energy(E = kBT ). The
arrows indicate the cases discussed in the text.

Using the results shown in Fig. 6, one can now sim-
ply read oﬀ the probability for speciﬁc collision ener-
gies. At an energy of 2.35 mK, which corresponds to
an angle of incidence of about 40 degrees (indicated by
the left arrows in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 6),
we have almost the entire population equally distributed
in the three diﬀraction orders (0,0) and (±1,0). Fig-
ure 7 shows the complete set of diﬀraction probabilities
P(m, n) for this case. One sees clearly that the only sig-
niﬁcant diﬀraction is out-of-plane, and the three domi-
nating diﬀraction channels have almost equal probability
of 30 percent each. The diﬀraction angle, given roughly
by the ratio of deBroglie wavelength to grating periodic-
ity, is quite large–about 2.6 degrees. This geometry could
thus be a very attractive for the realization of an atomic
beam splitter or for atomic interferometry.

As a second example, we have shown in Fig. 8 the
situation at slightly higher collision energy of 2.52
mK. With the chosen initial transverse momentum
this corresponds to an angle of incidence of about 38
degrees. The maximum of the ﬁnal state population is
now concentrated in the orders (0,±1) while the specular
direction is suppressed to about 10 percent. At this
slightly higher energy, we ﬁnd also the diﬀraction peaks
(0,±2) to be populated. Still, the ratio between P(0, 0)
(or P(0, ±2)) and P(0, ±1) is about 3, and the angle

FIG. 7: Diﬀraction probabilities P(m, n) for Cs atoms with a
total energy of 2.35 mK corresponding to a drop height of 15
mm (left arrows in Fig. 3) and an angle of incidence (between
the vertical axis and the surface normal) of 40 degrees. The
diﬀraction angle between the orders (0, ±1) is ≃ 2.6 degrees

spanned by the two main diﬀraction peaks P(0, 1) and
P(0, −1) is about 2 degrees.

C. Diﬀraction probabilities neglecting ground state
degeneracy

In the previous section, we have calculated the diﬀrac-
tion probability including the ground state degeneracy.
As can be seen from Eq. 8, the intricate spatial distribu-
tions of polarization in general do not allow treatment
of the problem as a one-surface scattering event, but re-
quire the solution of multiple internal states coupled to
the optical potential. However, as one sees from Fig. 3,
the electric ﬁeld is dominated by the E+ and E− compo-
nents, with the E0 one order of magnitude smaller (the
axis for the polarization state is chosen to be orthogonal
to the plane of incidence of the laser beam). One sees
from Eq. 8 that the coupling between the ground state
sublevels in the present case of an S1/2 → P3/2 transi-
tion is due to the E0 component. Hence if the component

tational burden, can yield satisfactory results. Thus in
this particular case a one-surface calculation gives very
good agreement with the full results, even for the weakly
populated diﬀraction orders. In general, however, with
atoms having higher ground-state multiplicity and with
diﬀerent optical materials and excitation geometries, a
full coupled-surface calculation will be necessary.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have investigated the diﬀraction of
cold atoms by highly structured subwavelength optical
potentials generated from evanescent ﬁelds. Our ap-
proach includes a three dimensional quantum treatment
of the atomic center of mass motion. We take into ac-
count the spatial distribution of rapidly varying polar-
ization states of the nanostructured optical ﬁelds and in-
clude the eﬀect of these polarization changes on the atom
ground internal state populations.

As an illustration, we have chosen a model system that
corresponds to cold cesium atoms (without nuclear spin)
diﬀracting from a nanostructured surface illuminated un-
der conditions of total internal reﬂection. The interaction
of cold atoms with these light ﬁelds is calculated in the
limit of large detuning and negligible absorption. For ex-
perimentally realistic initial conditions, we ﬁnd diﬀrac-
tion angles on the order of 2 degrees with about two
thirds of the initial atomic ﬂux concentrated in the ﬁrst
two diﬀraction orders. These structures may therefore
prove useful in wide-angle atomic interferometers.

VI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

FIG. 8: Same as Fig. 7, but for a total energy of 2.56 mK,
corresponding to a drop height of 16 mm,(right arrows in
Fig. 6) and an angle of incidence of 38 degrees. The diﬀraction
angle between the orders (0, ±)is ≃ 2.0 degrees.

E0 is suﬃciently small, the system of Eqs. 6,8 decouples
and we have the situation of an eﬀective single-surface
collision. Consistent with this observation, we ﬁnd that,
starting from a well-deﬁned initial mj level, less than
0.1 percent of the population is transferred to the other
one. As a consequence, one can assume that a treatment

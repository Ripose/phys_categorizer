We introduce a semiclassical model for moving highly excited atomic ions in a magnetic ﬁeld
which allows us to describe the mixing of the Landau orbitals of the center of mass in terms of the
electronic excitation and magnetic ﬁeld. The extent of quantum energy ﬂow in the ion is investigated
and a crossover from localization to delocalization with increasing center of mass energy is detected.
It turns out that our model of the moving ion in a magnetic ﬁeld is closely connected to models for
transport in disordered ﬁnite-size wires.

Interacting particle systems in strong magnetic ﬁelds show a rich variety of complex phenomena. The source
of this complexity is competition between the magnetic and Coulomb interactions which are of inherently diﬀerent
character. With changing strength of the external ﬁeld the corresponding systems undergo a metamorphosis involving
qualitatively diﬀerent states. In atomic physics attention focused for more than a decade on the hydrogen atom in a
magnetic ﬁeld (see ref. [1] and references therein) on which detailed experimental and theoretical investigations yielded
many beautiful insights into semiclassical and quantum aspects of nonintegrable systems and signiﬁcantly enhanced
our understanding of the new features arising due to the presence of the external ﬁeld. With increasing degree of
excitation and/or increasing ﬁeld strength the electronic motion of the classical atom shows a transition from regular
to irregular, i.e. chaotic, behavior and intermittency. More recently it has become evident that the non-separability
of the collective, i.e., center of mass (CM), and electronic motion of atoms in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld leads
to a variety of two-body phenomena. The corresponding coupling of the CM and electronic motion is fundamentally
diﬀerent for neutral and charged systems. Examples of two-body eﬀects in neutral systems are the classical chaotic
diﬀusion of the CM [2] or the existence of weakly bound giant dipole states [3]. For atomic ions the interaction of the
CM and electronic degrees of freedom is more intricate and manifests itself in a continuous, classical ﬂow of energy
from the collective to the internal motion and vice versa. Detailed studies of the classical dynamics of rapidly moving
highly excited He+-ions in a magnetic ﬁeld showed that this energy exchange leads to the self-ionization process [4] of
the ion. Very little, however, is known about the quantum properties and behavior of moving highly excited atomic
ions.

Using Landau orbitals for the CM motion in zeroth-order and ﬁxed nucleus zero-ﬁeld wave functions for the
electronic motion to estimate their coupling matrix elements, it was demonstrated [5] that there exist a number of
diﬀerent physical situations for which the interaction between the collective and electronic motion becomes strong.
The latter induces a strong mixing of the CM and electronic motion and is a potential source of interesting quantum
properties of the ion, in particular when the dynamics of the corresponding classical ion is chaotic. A detailed
investigation of the coupled CM and electronic motion of the highly-excited quantum mechanical ion in this regime,
which is the subject of interest of the present paper, is however a highly nontrivial task: we are dealing with ﬁve
nonseparable and strongly mixing degrees of freedom in a regime of very high level density which depends on a number
of parameters (ﬁeld strength, total energy, etc.). The ab initio description of the quantum dynamics in the above
regime goes even beyond modern computational possibilities and we thus seek a model approach that captures the
essential physics of the problem. Here we propose and analyze a semiclassical model of the excited ion, and explore
the consequences of coupling between its CM and electronic degrees of freedom.

Since we deal with the interaction of the CM and electronic motion in atomic ions we ﬁrst have to introduce
collective (CM) and relative variables in the Hamiltonian describing the atom. The total pseudomomentum K [6] is
a conserved quantity associated with the CM motion which, in spite of the fact that its components perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld are not independent, i.e. do not commute, can be used to transform the Hamiltonian to a
particularly simple and physically appealing form [5] which for the He+-ion reads

chaotic electronic motion we have made Poincar´e surfaces of section (PSOS) of the classical dynamics of
(cid:17)
for a dense grid of values of the scaled energy and angular momentum. Starting with a completely chaotic phase
space for ˆLz = 0 we ﬁnd that with increasing values of the angular momentum the fraction of chaotic phase space
volume decreases rapidly. In contrast, the regime of negative ˆLz that yields predominantly chaotic phase space is
much larger. If we take a typical scaled energy of ˆE =
0.1, for example, and require more than 90% of phase space to
be occupied by chaotic trajectories we obtain the regime ˆLz = [

2.71, 0.136] which corresponds to Lz = [
for B = 10−5 (we use atomic units throughout, i.e. the ﬁeld strength B = 1 a.u. corresponds to 2.35
105 Tesla). The
mixing of electronic eigenfunctions belonging to negative values of the angular momentum Lz represents therefore an
important ’open channel’ with respect to the coupling of the chaotic electronic motion to the CM motion. In this
region of Lz the CM motion of the classical ion is strongly aﬀected by coupling to the chaotic electron. Indeed, studies
of the classical dynamics of the ion close to the ionization threshold demonstrated [4] that large negative values of the
angular momentum are an inherent feature of intermittent dynamics as well as a prerequisite for the self-ionization
process, whereby energy transfer from the CM to the electron results in ionization. We therefore turn our attention
to this subspace and investigate the quantum mechanical properties of this channel.

The spectrum belonging to the chaotic Hamiltonian

3 will be represented by a random matrix ensemble, which
is the appropriate semiclassical description [9,10]. Since the Hamiltonian
3 possesses a generalized time reversal
invariance [8], which consists of a rotation by π around the x-axis and a subsequent conventional time reversal
operation, the proper ensemble is the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). While the GOE provides the ﬂuctuations
of the chaotic levels, we still need to specify the mean level density (MLD) as a function of the energy, ﬁeld strength
and in particular the angular momentum Lz. Our approach to the MLD is via the semiclassical Thomas-Fermi
formula. Performing the appropriate scale transformations, ﬁxing ˆLz, transforming to cylindrical coordinates and
subsequently performing the integrations over φ, pz, pρ, z we arrive at the following result for the semiclassical MLD

with Lz = 0 a general feature of the MLD is its rapid decrease with increasing Lz whereas for negative values of
Lz its decay is much weaker. Not only the fraction of chaotic phase space but also the absolute phase space volume

through classical trajectory calculations is by no means trivial and is done by introducing a suitable ensemble average

via the periodogram approximation [12]. Fig. 1 shows χ

rules N increases (decreases) by 1 as m decreases (increases) by 1. As seen in the ﬁgure, the largest values of χ lie

H2 is given by eq.(3). The model thus has a one-dimensional
structure, where sites labeled by N , m and µ are comprised of levels taken to be from a GOE whose density is given
by eq.(2). The ion model so deﬁned resembles the semiclassical pump model of Arnold diﬀusion [13]. The classical
stochastic pump model describes Arnold diﬀusion in terms of pumping of otherwise regular trajectories via weak,
irregular motion within the Hamiltonian system [14]. Similarly, the classical CM motion of the ion is coupled to the
chaotic motion of the electron due to the magnetic ﬁeld. The semiclassical pump model of Arnold diﬀusion was found
to be equivalent to models of single-particle transport in disordered wires, which predict localization [15–17]. The
localization length of the semiclassical pump model was expressed in terms of corresponding classical parameters.
Likewise, we should be able to predict any localization of the quantum ion in terms of the corresponding classical
system.

of which are shown in Fig. 1. Though χ clearly ﬂuctuates over the sites of the model, we could nevertheless estimate
the localization length for this model in terms of an average, ¯χ, over χ. As seen in Fig. 1, the range in m over which
energy transfer can most appreciably occur is m
200], though the model also encompasses a wider range of
−
m, where classically the ion is still predominately chaotic. In terms of the average ¯χ, the localization length, ξ∞, of
the model assuming an inﬁnite number of sites, is ξ∞ = 4π2 ¯χ2 [13,16]. Because the ion model has a ﬁnite length of
about 200 sites, the localization length can be estimated using ﬁnite-size scaling arguments for band random matrices,
1 [18], where L is the length, or number of sites of the model. The

These arguments, while using well known predictions for equivalent random matrix models, nevertheless depend on
our being able to use an average of χ over the length of the model to estimate ξ. As a check, we have studied numerically
the ion model to compare predictions of ξ using the actual χ which varies as determined by the semiclassical results

number, it is all we could include computationally while incorporating also the largest possible number of sites. We
average over 6 realizations of each set of parameters and calculate the localization length of the eigenvectors. Results
are shown in Fig. 2, where we see that both models, the ion and the simpler version with ¯χ, give the same results for
ξ, and are close to the line ξ = 0.72ξ∞, where ξ∞ = 4π2 ¯χ2, and the factor 0.72 is purely an artifact of using only 12
levels per site, which is seen upon comparing with numerical results where more levels per site were used [13].

The occurence of the crossover from localized to delocalized CM motion that we ﬁnd for the ion at a CM energy
10−6 a.u. with the above parameters will of course vary with the strength of the ﬁeld and the internal
of about 6
energy of the ion, as well as its mass, since we have here considered only He+. This crossover should be observable
spectroscopically since the regime of very weak and strong mixing show inherently diﬀerent level spacings and absorb-
tion features. Finally, we mention that the above-investigated quantum mixing of collective and electronic motion for
atomic ions is certainly of interest also for charged molecular systems in a magnetic ﬁeld. Here the heavy vibrational
and rotational degrees of freedom couple, for heteronuclear systems, to the collective motion of the molecular ion
providing a potential source of new rotational and vibrational structures.

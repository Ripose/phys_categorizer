Abstract

Excited state angular momentum alignment – orientation conversion for

atoms with hyperﬁne structure in presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld is

investigated. Transversal orientation in these conditions is reported for the

ﬁrst time. This phenomenon occurs under Paschen Back conditions at in-

termediate magnetic ﬁeld strength. Weak radiation from a linearly polarized

diode laser is used to excite Rb atoms in a cell. The laser beam is polarized at

an angle of π/4 with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld direction. Ground

state hyperﬁne levels of the 5S1/2 state are resolved using laser-induced ﬂuo-

rescence spectroscopy under conditions for which all excited 5P3/2 state hyper-

ﬁne components are excited simultaneously. Circularly polarized ﬂuorescence

is observed to be emitted in the direction perpendicular to both to the direc-

tion of the magnetic ﬁeld B and direction of the light polarization E. The

obtained circularity is shown to be in quantitative agreement with theoretical

predictions.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the absence of external forces an ensemble of unpolarized atoms can only be aligned [1]

by linearly polarized light. The fact that the atoms are only aligned implies that, although

the magnetic sublevels of diﬀerent |mJ | are populated unequally, magnetic sublevels of +mJ

and −mJ are equally populated. For this reason, atoms excited by linearly polarized laser

radiation are not expected to produce circularly polarized ﬂuorescence. In the presence of

external forces, however, excitation by linear polarized light can produce an orientated pop-

ulation of atoms (with diﬀerent +mJ and −mJ populations.) This eﬀect, called alignment

– orientation conversion, was predicted and experimentally observed in the late sixties in

the anisotropic collisions of initially aligned atoms [2–5]. Later an electric ﬁeld was also

shown to induce alignment – orientation conversion [6]. Electric-ﬁeld-induced alignment –

2

orientation conversion has since been studied in great detail [7].

Contrary to the case of an electric ﬁeld, linear perturbation by a magnetic ﬁeld is not

able to orient an initially aligned angular momentum distribution. This inability to induce

alignment – orientation conversion is a result of the reﬂection symmetry of axial vector

ﬁelds. This symmetry can be broken if, in addition to the linear Zeeman eﬀect, there

exists nonlinear dependencies of the magnetic sublevel energies on the ﬁeld intensity and

the magnetic quantum numbers mJ . Such nonlinear perturbations can have a variety of

causes including predissociation [8–11] and hyperﬁne interaction. Alignment – orientation

conversion as a result of hyperﬁne interaction in a magnetic ﬁeld in context of nuclear spin

I = 1/2 was studied by J. Lehmann for the case of optically pumped cadmium in a magnetic

ﬁeld [12,13]. W. Baylis described the same eﬀect in sodium [14]. The ﬁrst experiment to

detect directly a net circular polarization of ﬂuorescence from an initially aligned excited

state in an external magnetic ﬁeld was reported by M. Krainska – Miszczak [15].

In this

work the optical pumping of 85Rb by a π-polarized D2 line was studied. This eﬀect was also

examined by X. Han and G. Schinn in sodium atoms [16]. They describe this alignment

- orientation conversion process as resulting from hyperﬁne-F -level mixing in an external

magnetic ﬁeld and the interference of diﬀerent excitation – decay pathways in such mixed

levels.

In all above cases, a joint action of the magnetic ﬁeld and hyperﬁne interaction creates

diﬀerent population of magnetic sublevels +mF and −mF of hyperﬁne levels F . This means

that longitudinal orientation of atoms along the direction of an external magnetic ﬁeld is cre-

ated. Recently it was predicted that joint action of a magnetic ﬁeld and hyperﬁne interaction

from an initially aligned ensemble would create transverse orientation of angular momentum

of atoms or molecules [17]. Transverse orientation implies orientation in a direction perpen-

dicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld B. In this particular case magnetic sublevels +mF

and −mF are equally populated, but orientation is a result of coherence between pairs of

wave functions of magnetic sublevels mF with ∆mF = 1. Creation of transverse orientation

is achieved if the excitation light polarization vector is neither parallel nor perpendicular

3

to the external magnetic ﬁeld direction with the largest eﬀect occurring for the case of a

light polarization – magnetic ﬁeld angle of π/4.

In a previous paper [17], parameters of

the NaK molecule were used for numerical simulations of orientation and ﬂuorescence cir-

cularity signals. We found that transverse orientation only occurred when the rotational

angular momentum J is small enough to be comparable with the nuclear spin I. For levels

with larger angular momentum quantum number, the magnitude of created orientation was

found to decrease rapidly.

Previously transverse alignment – orientation conversion was studied in detail for the

case of an external electric ﬁeld [7].

In this case the conversion occurs with or without

hyperﬁne interaction.

In this paper we report the ﬁrst experimental observation to our

knowledge of alignment – orientation conversion that creates net transverse orientation of

atoms with hyperﬁne structure in an external magnetic ﬁeld. As we will show, this eﬀect is

interesting not only as a new way to create orientated atoms, but also can be used to increase

the accuracy with which constants related to the hyperﬁne interaction can be determined.

II. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION

The general scheme how transverse orientation of angular momentum is created from an

aligned ensemble of atoms is the following: Initial alignment, for example by absorption of a

linearly polarized light, is created at some non-zero acute angle with respect to the direction

of an external-ﬁeld (in this case a B-ﬁeld.) The optimum angle is π/4, but the eﬀect will

take place at any angle that diﬀers form 0 and π/2. The perturbing ﬁeld together with

the hyperﬁne interaction causes unequally spaced magnetic sublevel splittings. Under these

conditions, angular momenta orientation at the direction perpendicular to the direction of

the external ﬁeld is created [22]. A semiclassical interpretation of this eﬀect in terms of

angular momentum precession in an external ﬁeld can be found in a previous publication

[7].

In this vectorial model, alignment – orientation conversion is the result of a diﬀerent

precession rate for diﬀerent orientations of angular momentum with respect to the external

4

ﬁeld.

In what follows we explain this transverse-orientation in terms of a accurate quantum

mechanical model.

In the present study we exploit laser excitation of pure isotopes of Rb atoms from their

ground state 5S1/2 to the ﬁrst excited state 5P3/2 (resonance D2 line) (see inset Figure 5.)

The two most common naturally occurring isotopes of Rubidium are 85Rb(72.15 %, nuclear

spin I = 5/2) and 87Rb(27.85%, nuclear spin I = 3/2.) As a result of hyperﬁne interac-

tions, the ground-state level of 85Rb is split into components with total angular momentum

quantum numbers Fi = 2 and Fi = 3 and the ground-state level of 87Rb is split into compo-

nents with total angular momentum quantum numbers Fi = 1 and 2. The ground-state-level

splittings for 85Rb and 87Rb are approximately 3 GHz and 6 GHz respectively. In contrast,

the four excited state hyperﬁne components are separated by only several hundred MHz (see

Figures 1 and 3).

Excited-state-hyperﬁne structure in absorption is not resolved due to Doppler broadening

and laser-frequency jittering. To make an accurate signal modeling assuming broad line

excitation, laser frequency is modulated by a few hundred MHz superimposing a 10 kHz

sine wave on laser current. This allows accurate modeling to be done assuming that the

excitation radiation is broad enough to excite all hyperﬁne components of the excited state

without frequency selection, yet narrow enough to completely resolve the two ground-state

components.

Magnetic ﬁeld caused mixing takes place between sublevels with diﬀerent total angular

momentum Fe, but with identical magnetic quantum numbers mF . Only levels of identi-

cal mF mix because, as far as the magnetic ﬁeld possesses axial symmetry, the magnetic

quantum number mF remains a good quantum number. However, levels of diﬀerent Fe mix

because an intermediate strength magnetic ﬁeld partially decouples the electronic angular

momentum Je and nuclear spin I. As a consequence Fe ceases to be a good quantum num-

ber. The fact the mF remains a good quantum number whereas Fe does not is important

to the interpretation of the data.

A convenient way to describe excited state atoms is by means of a quantum density

5

matrix klfmm′ [18]. Upper indices characterize atomic states in a magnetic ﬁeld. In the

weak ﬁeld limit these states correspond to hyperﬁne levels Fe. Lower indices characterize

magnetic quantum numbers. We consider an atom possessing the hyperﬁne structure which

is placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld. We further assume that this atom absorbs laser light

polarized in the direction characterized by light electric ﬁeld vector Eexc. In this situation

the density matrix that characterizes coherence between magnetic sublevels with quantum

numbers m and m′ is given as [21]

Γp is a reduced absorption rate, Γ is the excited state relaxation rate and kl∆ωmm′ =

(γk Em −γl Em′)/~ is the energy splitting of magnetic sublevels m and m′ belonging to the

excited state levels k and l. Magnetic quantum numbers of the ground state level ηj are
denoted by µ and magnetic quantum numbers of the excited state level γk by m and m′.

In an external magnetic ﬁeld, ground- and excited- state levels ηj and γk are not charac-

terized by a total angular momentum quantum numbers Fi and Fe, but are instead mixtures

of these states:

The wave-function-expansion coeﬃcients C (e)

kFe, C (i)

represent the mixing of ﬁeld free hy-

perﬁne state wave functions by the magnetic ﬁeld. These expansion coeﬃcients along with

the magnetic sublevel energy splittings kl∆ωmm′ can be obtained by a standard procedure

of diagonalization of a Hamilton matrix that contains both the diagonal hyperﬁne elements

and the oﬀ-diagonal magnetic ﬁeld interaction elements (see for example [17].)

There are several methods how to tell whether or not a particular atomic state described

by a density matrix (1) possesses orientation. One possibility is to expand this matrix

over the irreducible tensorial operators. Then those expansion coeﬃcients can directly be

attributed to the alignment and orientation of the atomic ensemble [18–20]. Alternatively,

6

one may calculate directly the ﬂuorescence circularity rate in spontaneous transitions from

a particular excited state of an atom:

C =

I(Eright) − I(Elef t)
I(Eright) + I(Elef t)

(3)

Observed circularity of the ﬂuorescence in a speciﬁc direction can diﬀer from zero only for the

case that the ensemble of atoms possesses overall orientation in this direction [18]. I(Eright)

and I(Elef t) are intensities of two ﬂuorescence components with opposite circularity. We

choose to calculate this expected circularity rate because it is the experimental measure used

to register the appearance of orientation in an ensemble of atoms (see for example [22]).

We consider the case that spontaneous emission is detected without hyperﬁne-state reso-

lution. The intensity of the ﬂuorescence with deﬁnite polarization characterized by a vector

Ef in a spontaneous transition from an excited state Je characterized by a set γk of levels in

an external ﬁeld to the ground state Jf characterized by a set ηj of levels can be calculated

according to a previous work [21] as

To ﬁnd the circularity rate C, one needs to not only determine the matrix elements appearing

in (1) and (4), but also the hyperﬁne level splitting and magnetic sublevel mixing coeﬃcients.

In Figure 1 the hyperﬁne energy level splitting of the ﬁrst excited state 5P3/2 for 85Rb is

presented. In these calculations the following published [23] hyperﬁne splitting constants

and magnetic moment for the rubidium atom in its ﬁrst excited state are used: a = 25.009

MHz, b = 25.83 MHz, gJ = −1.3362, gI = 0.000293.

In Figure 1 level crossing positions for magnetic sublevels with ∆mFe = 2 are indicated

by circles and crossings with ∆mFe = 1 by squares. At values of magnetic ﬁeld strength

for which coherently excited magnetic sublevels undergo a level crossing, kl∆ωmm′ = 0

the prefactor appearing in Equation (1) becomes large. This leads to resonance behavior

of the observed signal. For case of excitation with linearly polarized light, the intensity

of the resonance depends upon the angle between polarization direction of the laser light

7

and external magnetic ﬁeld direction. If the angle between these directions is 0, diﬀerent

magnetic sublevels are diﬀerently populated but no coherence is created in the ensemble. If

the angle is π/2 coherence is created between magnetic sublevels with ∆mFe = 2.

If the

angle diﬀers form 0 and π/2 then magnetic sublevels with ∆mFe = 1 and 2 [22] are excited

coherently. This ∆mFe = 1 coherence is required for transverse orientation.

We now consider the ﬂuorescence circularity enhancement due to ∆mFe = 1 level crossing

for the case that the linear polarization and external ﬁeld meet at an angle of π/4 (inset

Figure 2.) The circularity C is calculated assuming an excited state relaxation rate [24]

Γ = 3.8 × 107 s−1 and observation along an axis normal to the plain containing the external

ﬁeld B and the polarization vector Eexc. The smooth lines of Figure 2 give the expected

signals for both resolved absorption lines. Both signals are maximum at an approximate

magnetic ﬁeld strength of 10 G. For both absorption lines we calculate a total ﬂuorescence

circularity with unresolved hyperﬁne components in a transition back to the ground state

5S1/2. The resonance peak is more pronounced for the Fi = 2 −→ Fe absorption transition

than for the Fi = 3 −→ Fe transition.

Because a 10 G ﬁeld is weak enough not to cause substantial hyperﬁne level mixing

(i.e., the magnetic sublevel splitting in the magnetic ﬁeld still is small in comparison with

hyperﬁne splitting,) the increase in orientation for Fi = 2 absorption can be understood

using the relative transition probability WFi−→Fe given by Sobelman [20]:

WFi−→Fe = (2Fi + 1)(2Fe + 1)(2Ji + 1)(2Je + 1)

Here Ji, Je and Li, Le are quantum numbers of total and orbital electronic angular mo-

mentum of the initial and ﬁnal atomic state and S is the electronic spin of the atomic

state. Quantities in curled brackets are 6 − j symbols. This expression predicts that the

Fi = 2 −→ Fe = 2 absorption contributes 39% of the total allowed ( ∆F = 0, ±1) absorption

from Fi = 2.

In contrast, the Fi = 3 −→ Fe = 2 absorption contributes only 8% of the

total allowed (∆F = 0, ±1) absorption from Fi = 3. At the same time the Fe = 2 state is

8

the state for which the magnetic sublevels undergo a level crossing in the vicinity of a 10

G magnetic ﬁeld. Thus the absorption from the Fi = 2 state leads to a greater degree of

transverse orientation.

Similar level splitting diagrams (Figure 3) and expected circularity signals (Figure 4) are

calculated also for rubidium isotope 87Rb. In this case the following atomic constants are

used: I = 3/2, a = 84.845 MHz, b = 12.52 MHz, gJ = −1.3362, gI = −0.000995 [23].

III. EXPERIMENTAL

In our experiment we use isotopically enriched rubidium (99 % of 85Rb) contained in a

glass cell at room temperature to keep atomic vapor concentration low and avoid reabsorp-

tion. The 5s 2S1/2 to 5p 2P3/2 transition at 780.2 nm is excited using a temperature- and

current- stabilized single-mode diode laser (Sony SLD114VS). Absorption signal is mea-

sured using a photodiode. As the laser frequency is swept using a ramped current drive,

two absorption peaks with half-width of about 600 MHz separated by ∼ 3 GHz appear due

to the 85Rb ground state hyperﬁne structure. The excited-state hyperﬁne structure is not

resolved under the Doppler proﬁle and introduced laser-frequency jittering. The laser line

width without jittering is about 60 MHz. To avoid optical pumping and other nonlinear

eﬀects, neutral density ﬁlters are used to reduce the laser intensity until absorption lines at

60 G broaden by less than 10%.

During the level crossing and circularity measurements, the laser wavelength is stabilized

on one of the two absorption peaks. Fluorescence is monitored on an axis normal to the

electric vector Eexc and external magnetic ﬁeld B. A two-lens system is used to image the

ﬂuorescence on a photodetector containing a 3 × 3 mm photodiode (Hamamatsu S1223-

01) and a transimpedance ampliﬁer. A rotating (f = 240 Hz) sheet polarizer is inserted

between the lenses. The photodetector signal is fed to a lock-in ampliﬁer (Femto LIA-MV-

150) that measures the intensity diﬀerence of two orthogonal linearly polarized ﬂuorescence

components. A magnetic ﬁeld of up to 65 G is produced by passing current through a pair

9

of Helmholz coils 20 cm in diameter. The uncertainty of the magnetic ﬁeld is estimated to

±0.3 G. The sweep time is 5 s and 256 sweeps are averaged on an IBM compatible computer

with a National Instruments data acquisition card. A lock-in time constant of 10 ms is used.

Several adjustments are made to record symmetrical level crossing signals while sweeping

the magnetic ﬁeld in opposite directions. First, a linear polarizer is placed in a laser beam

before the rubidium cell to ﬁne adjust the laser polarization. Second, the lock-in phase is

adjusted and, third, the Earth magnetic ﬁeld components are compensated with additional

Helmholz coils.

To detect circularly polarized light the gain electronics are ﬁrst adjusted so that the linear

polarization signals are symmetrical in opposite magnetic ﬁeld directions. A λ/4 wave plate

is then placed before the polarizer so that right- and left- handed circularly polarized light

components are converted to opposite polarizations.

It is checked that circularity signal at

B = 0 is zero. During the circularity measurements the magnetic ﬁeld is swept alternatively

in one and another direction and both traces are averaged. The experimentally recorded

signal actually is I(Eright) − I(Elef t) and not the ratio (I(Eright) − I(Elef t))/(I(Eright) +

I(Elef t)). Numerical simulations reveal that these two signals have almost the same shapes,

the relative diﬀerence is less than 3%. Experimentally recorded signals are scaled vertically

to ﬁt the calculated ones.

Figures 2 and 4 compare experimentally obtained circularity to the theoretical ones.

After the scaling factor to the experimental signal is applied (no other adjustable parameters

are used) an excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental signals

can be observed. For both isotopes circularity signals with amplitude of several percents are

measured.

In case of the measurements with 87Rb another cell was used, that contained isotopically

enriched 87Rb (99%). For this isotope the signal starting from Fi = 1 exhibits stronger

resonance circularity than the one starting from the Fi = 2 ground state. The reason for

this is the same as already discussed in a Section II for the 85Rb isotope. Only in this case

the excited state hyperﬁne component Fe = 1 undergoes level crossings with ∆mFe = ±1.

10

This resonance intensity ratio for two measured signals reﬂects the general situation that

transitions with ∆F = 0 are more intense than transitions with ∆F = ±1.

IV. COMPARISON OF CIRCULARITY MEASUREMENTS TO OTHER

LEVEL-CROSSING MEASUREMENTS

In previous studies, atoms are excited by a linearly polarized light with Eexc vector

perpendicular to an external magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬂuorescence emitted along the magnetic

ﬁeld is then detected. Fluorescence linear polarization as a function of magnetic ﬁeld is

measured. Here we repeat this experiment for the case of 85Rb (see inset of Figure 5.) Two

signals are numerically simulated and experimentally recorded, the ﬁrst one when absorption

occurs on the transitions (Fi = 2 → Fe) and a second one for a (Fi = 3 → Fe) absorption

transition. In both cases the conditions are maintained so that the excited state hyperﬁne

levels are not resolved. For the ﬁrst absorption transition in the absence of the magnetic

ﬁeld electric dipole transitions are allowed only to the levels Fe = 1, 2, and 3. For the second

absorption transition in absence of the external ﬁeld hyperﬁne components with Fe = 2, 3,

and 4 can be excited.

In presence of the magnetic ﬁeld selection rules change substantially. As it was mentioned

before, Fe is no longer a good quantum number. Each hyperﬁne level in the presence of

external ﬁeld is mixed together with others. As far as mFe remains a good quantum number

in the presence of the external ﬁeld, only components with the same mFe are mixed. This

implies that for the present example of 85Rb, magnetic sublevels with mFe = 4 and −4

at any ﬁeld value are unmixed because only Fe = 4 contains such sublevels and there is

no counterpart for these states to be mixed with.

In case of mFe = 3 and −3 only two

magnetic sublevels originating from Fe = 3 and 4 are mixed together, etc. This means

that magnetic sublevels mFe = 0, ±1 in external ﬁeld are composed from Fe = 1, 2, 3, 4

components, mFe = ±2, from Fe = 2, 3, 4 components mFe = ±3, from Fe = 3, 4 components

but mFe = ±4, contain only one component Fe = 4.

11

In Figure 1 we can see several ∆mFe = 2 magnetic sublevel crossings. The ﬁrst crossing

takes place at zero magnetic ﬁeld when all magnetic sublevels belonging to the same hyperﬁne

level have the same energy. This crossing is the zero ﬁeld level crossing. Because all

magnetic sublevels belonging to the same hyperﬁne state cross at zero ﬁeld, the zero ﬁeld

level crossing leads to the largest resonance amplitude. Then subsequent crossings take

place at approximately 2.4, 4.2, 8.2, 24, 44, 52 and 74 G magnetic ﬁeld strength. A resonant

peak occurs on both linear polarization signals for almost every one of these level crossings,

although with diﬀering amplitudes (see Figure 5.) There is one exception. The strong

resonance peak at 52 G that is present in Fi = 3 → Fe signal is missing in Fi = 2 → Fe

signal. This seeming inconsistency can be easily explained. This resonance appears when the

magnetic sublevels mFe=4 = −4 and mFe=3 = −2 are crossing. But as it was mentioned due

to dipole transition selection rules the mFe=4 = −4 level can not be excited from Fi = 2 and

this restriction can not be removed by external ﬁeld because mFe=4 = −4 remains unmixed

at any ﬁeld strength.

In the same Figure 5 along with the theoretically simulated signal the experimentally

registered signal is depicted as well. The only adjustable parameter in this comparison is a

scaling factor for the overall intensity of the experimentally detected signal. The observed

signals agrees very well with level crossing signal registered by several groups before us

[24,25]. However, in these previous studies the ﬁrst derivative from the intensity was mea-

sured and so we were able to compare only the exact positions of resonances. These coincide

perfectly. In our case we are able to calculate not only the positions of resonances, but also

the shape, width and relative amplitudes of the resonance peaks.

In this study we report for the ﬁrst time the appearance of transverse orientation in

atoms with hyperﬁne structure after excitation by linearly polarized light in the presence of

an external magnetic ﬁeld. We have also presented a theory that is in quantitative agreement

V. CONCLUSIONS

12

with our data. The use of transverse alignment-orientation as a probe of level crossings is

compared to previous measurements The case of measured circularity has an advantage

over the more conventional measurement of the degree of linear polarization: For the case

of alignment – orientation conversion, there is no signal in the absence of the external ﬁeld.

This implies that we do not have the ﬁrst trivial resonance position at zero ﬁeld value which

is always present in traditional geometry (Hanle eﬀect [26].) This allows measurements of

ﬁrst level crossing positions that are very close to the zero ﬁeld resonance. In traditional

methods these resonances are hidden under the zero ﬁeld peak. For example, from the inset

of Figure 1 we can see that there must exist several resonances of ∆mFe = 2 crossings around

3 and 6 G. However these resonances are hidden in a traditional level crossing signal and

can not be observed (see Figure 5.) At the same time ∆mFe = 1 crossings that appear even

at smaller ﬁeld values 2, 4 and 8 G in alignment – orientation conversion signals, although

not fully resolved are clearly visible. The possibility to detect these resonances can improve

the precision of atomic hyperﬁne splitting constants.

We report direct observation of a rainbow caustic in the
velocity distribution of 87Rb atoms, bouncing inelastically on
an evanescent-wave atom mirror.
In contrast to known ex-
amples, this caustic is caused by a stochastic process, namely
a spontaneous Raman transition during the bounce. The re-
sults are in good agreement with a classical calculation. We
observed that although energy is extracted from the atoms,
the phase-space density is in most cases not increased.

Caustics are ubiquitous phenomena in nature. Exam-
ples are the cusp-shaped patterns of light reﬂection on the
inside of a coﬀee-cup and the patterns of bright lines ob-
served on the bottom of a swimming pool [1]. The prime
example of a caustic is the common rainbow, which can
be understood in a ray-optics picture by considering how
the scattering angle of a light ray depends on its impact
parameter on a water droplet [2] . Whereas the incident
rays have smoothly distributed impact parameters, the
outgoing rays pile up where the scattering angle has a
local extremum. Such a divergence of the ray density,
the caustic, appears at the rainbow angle. In atomic [3]
and nuclear [4] scattering experiments analogous rainbow
phenomena have also been observed.

The examples of caustics that have been known so far
have in common that the outgoing parameter (scattering
angle) is a deterministic function of the incoming param-
eter (impact parameter). In this Letter we report on our
observation of a new type of rainbow caustic existing by
virtue of a stochastic process, which distributes a single-
valued “impact parameter” over a range of “scattering
angles”. To our knowledge, this type of caustic has not
been observed before.

We have observed this caustic in the velocity distri-
bution of cold atoms, after bouncing inelastically oﬀ an
evanescent-wave mirror [5–7]. The incident atoms are
monochromatic, i.e. they all have the same velocity. Dur-
ing the bounce the atoms are optically pumped to a dif-
ferent hyperﬁne ground-state, by a spontaneous Raman
transition. They leave the surface with less kinetic en-
ergy, due to the diﬀerence in optical potential. Our mea-
surements and analysis show that the resulting velocity
distribution is highly asymmetric, containing a caustic at
the minimum velocity. This divergence demonstrates the
strong preference for making the Raman transition in the

1

turning point.

We brieﬂy discuss the divergence in the velocity dis-
tribution in the context of evanescent-wave cooling [5,7].
Calculations show that although energy is extracted from
the atoms, a single inelastic bounce generally leads to a
decrease of phase space density.

The experiment is performed in a rubidium vapor cell.
We trap about 107 atoms of 87Rb in a magneto-optical
trap (MOT) and subsequently cool them in optical mo-
lasses to 15 µK. The MOT has a 1/e2 radius of 0.6 mm
and is centered 5.8 mm above the horizontal surface of
a right-angle BK7 prism. At this surface, we create an
evanescent wave (EW) by a Gaussian shaped laser beam
of 0.8 mm 1/e2 radius, which undergoes total internal
reﬂection.

When blue detuned, the EW induces a repulsive op-
tical dipole potential UF (z) = UF (0) exp(
2κz), where
the subscript F = 1, 2 denotes the hyperﬁne ground
state, κ = k0p
1, with k0 = 2π/λ the free
space wave vector of the light, n = 1.51 the refractive
index and θ the angle of incidence [8–10]. The maxi-
mum potential UF (0)
I0/δF , where I0 is the incident
intensity at the glass surface, and δF is the detuning.
Here we deﬁne the detuning δ1,2 relative to the transi-
5P3/2(F ′ = F + 1) of the D2 line
tion 5S1/2(F = 1, 2)
(780 nm), see Fig.1.

scattering can transfer the atom to the higher hyperﬁne
ground state (F = 2). When transferred into this state,
the potential acting on the atom is U2(z), which is weaker
due to the increase of the detuning by approximately the
δ1 + δhfs (Fig.1). The ratio of the
hyperﬁne splitting δ2
two potentials, β
U2(0)/U1(0), quantiﬁes the reduction
in potential energy. As a result the atoms will bounce in-
elastically, i.e. to a lower height than their initial release
position.

Experimental data of bouncing atoms are taken by ab-
sorption imaging. After a variable time delay the atomic
cloud is exposed to 20 µs of probe light, resonant with
5P3/2(F ′ = 3) transition. Thus only
the 5S1/2(F = 2)
atoms which have been transferred to F = 2 contribute
to the signal. The atomic cloud is imaged on a digital
frame-transfer CCD camera. The presented images show
4.5 mm2 with a pixel resolution of 15 µm
an area of 2.2
(Fig.2) . The initial position of the MOT is outside the
ﬁeld of view. The horizontal line at the bottom shows

A typical series with 2 ms time increments is shown in
Fig.2. Each density proﬁle has been converted in a hori-
zontal line sum. The solid curve is the result of a calcula-
tion described below. The amplitude of the experimental
curves is rescaled such that the maximum optical density
of the experimental curve coincides with the theoretical
maximum value. This is the only ﬁt parameter.

As expected, the atoms bounce up less high than
their initial height. Furthermore, the spatial distribution
shows another striking feature:
it displays a high den-
sity peak at low z, and a long low-density tail extending
upward. Note also that there is a time-focus: the den-
sity peak is sharpest when the slowest atoms reach their
upper turning point. This density peak is an immedi-
ate consequence of a caustic appearing at the minimum
possible velocity.

The caustic can be understood by considering the
atoms as point particles moving in the EW potential.
This corresponds to the ray-optics limit for the optical
rainbow. We consider an atom arriving at the surface in
its F = 1 hyperﬁne ground state, with an initial down-
ward velocity vi < 0. Its trajectory through phase space
is determined by energy conservation: U1(0) exp(
2κz)+
1
2 mv2 = 1
i , and is depicted in Fig.4 by the thick line.
While it is slowed down by the EW it may scatter a pho-
ton at a velocity vp, and be transferred to the F = 2 state.
The atom continuous on a new trajectory determined by
U2(z). To illustrate the formation of the caustic, possible
trajectories starting at various positions in phase space
are depicted as thin black (vp < 0) and gray (vp > 0)
curves. For asymptotically large z the density of curves
represents the outgoing velocity distribution, showing the
caustic where the trajectories pile up. This distribution
is similar to a rainbow. The density of outgoing tra-
jectories diverges at the ”rainbow velocity”. Below this
velocity the intensity is zero, similar to Alexander’s dark
band in the optical rainbow. Above the rainbow velocity
the intensity distribution decreases smoothly.

Despite the similarities, there is a crucial diﬀerence
between a rainbow created by sunlight refracted by wa-
terdroplets and our ’velocity caustic’. The appearance of
a rainbow is usually a deterministic process, where the
scattering angle is uniquely determined by the impact
parameter. In our experiment the incoming velocity vi
is single-valued, and is distributed over a range of out-
going velocities by the stochastic process of spontaneous
Raman scattering.

The position of our caustic is independent of κ, like in
the optical rainbow, where the rainbow angle does not de-
pend on the droplet size. To check this, we measured for
three diﬀerent values of the decay length κ−1 the atomic
density proﬁle at the upper turning point (Fig.3c). This
is deﬁned as the highest position reached by the peak
density. The shape of the cloud did not change, but the
number of atoms decreased with decreasing κ since the
total number of scattered photons is lower.

By varying the detuning, β is changed, resulting in a

change of the rainbow velocity. Note that this amounts
to varying the “degree of dissipation.” This is analogous
to the dependence of the rainbow angle on the refractive
index. For various values of the detuning we measured
the upper turning point, as a fraction of the initial MOT
height (Fig.4a,b).

velocity caustic originates from atoms which are pumped
near the turning point. There are two reasons for scat-
tering preferentially at this position. An atom spends a
relatively long time in the turning point since its velocity
is lowest there. In addition, the intensity of the EW, and
thus the photon scattering rate is highest in the turn-
ing point. The divergence is an artefact of the ray-optics
description.
It disappears due to diﬀraction when the
atoms are treated as matter waves.

To compare the experimentally obtained spatial dis-

dimensional phase-space density ρ(z, v). The spatial
distribution is obtained by projecting ρ on the z-axis.
Initially the MOT is described by a normalized gaus-

sian, ρ(z, v)
z0 = 5.8 mm, σz = 0.3 mm and σv = 3.8 cm/s. This dis-
tribution falls due to gravity and expands due to thermal
motion. When it arrives at the EW it is reﬂected, and
the velocity distribution is changed in the way described
above. We measure the spatial distribution of inelasti-
cally bounced atoms after a time of ﬂight t. To illustrate
the agreement with the experimental data, the result for
a time t = 7 ms is drawn as the thick line in Fig. 2.

Considering the divergence in the distribution of out-
going velocities, it is interesting to calculate the max-
imum phase space density ρmax,
in the context of
evanescent-wave cooling. Due to the broad outgoing ve-
locity distribution, an unexpected result followed: al-
though energy is removed from the atoms, the pump-
ing process leads to a decrease of the maximum value
of the phase-space distribution. After the bounce, ρmax
is roughly ﬁve times lower than the initial 105 sm−2
per atom of the MOT for our experimental conditions.
Note that this is a one-dimensional calculation; trans-

When we compare ρmax of the bounced atoms with
ρMOT , we ﬁnd that the con-
that of MOT: ρmax = α
dition for α > 1 is mainly determined by β and vc (both
depending on the detuning), and the falling height h.
Note that the increase of ρmax does not violate Liou-
ville’s theorem. This is possible due to the spontaneous
character of the Raman transition. In Fig. 5, α is plotted
as a function of δ1 and h. For a ﬁxed falling height, α
reaches a maximum for a detuning δ1 such that 2vc =
.

This condition corresponds to a maximum pumping rate,
η(0)Γ′ in the turning point. In the limit of low vc, the
scattering rate at the turning point is low. When vc is too
high the F = 1 state is too quickly depleted which also
results in a low scattering rate. Decreasing the fall height
also yields a higher α since this determines the velocity
of the atoms arriving at the EW, hence the duration of
the bounce. This means that in EW-cooling experiments,
the ﬁrst bounces reduce the falling height but lead to a
decrease of ρmax. Only during later bounces can ρmax
increase, i.e. can the cloud be cooled. It should be noted
that this calculation is only valid for a single inelastic
bounce with an initial narrow distribution. After many
bounces the distribution will become barometric [11].

A very intriguing aspect of our experiment is the pos-
sibility to observe supernumeraries:
interference of two
trajectories with the same outgoing velocity, but with
diﬀerent pumping velocity vp. In the velocity distribu-
tion after the inelastic bounce, the high velocity tail is
the sum of two contributions:
from atoms which move
towards and atoms moving away from the surface when
they are pumped to F = 2. Interference between these
two paths should result in oscillations in the velocity dis-
tribution. This is a nontrivial eﬀect because it involves
the spontaneous emission of a photon.

Given our experimental parameters, we expect a typi-
cal oscillation period of 1 cm/s. This spacing depends on
κ, just as in a rainbow the supernumeraries depend on
the droplet size. These oscillations are not yet resolved in
our measurements, because in the EW-ﬁeld the magnetic
substates are not degenerate, each producing a diﬀerent
velocity distribution.

In conclusion, we observed a new type of caustic due
to the stochastic distribution of a monochromatic input.
This distribution is similar to the common rainbow. The
caustic appears in the velocity distribution of inelastically
bouncing rubidium atoms on an optical evanescent-wave
atom mirror. Calculations describing the phase space
evolution of the atomic cloud show that an increase as
well as a decrease of the phase-space density is possible.

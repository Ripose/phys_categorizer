Over a two-year duration, we have compared the frequency of the 199Hg+ 5d106s 2S1/2(F =
0) ←→ 5d96s2 2D5/2(F = 2) electric-quadrupole transition at 282 nm with the frequency of the
ground-state hyperﬁne splitting in neutral 133Cs. These measurements show that any fractional
time variation of the ratio νCs/νHg between the two frequencies is smaller than ±7 × 10−15yr−1
(1σ uncertainty). According to recent atomic structure calculations, this sets an upper limit to a
possible fractional time variation of gCs(me/mp)α6.0 at the same level.

The development of string theory models aiming at
a uniﬁed description of gravity and quantum mechanics
has renewed interest for improved experimental tests of
Einstein’s Equivalence Principle (EEP). Indeed, a com-
mon feature of these models is that they allow for, or
even predict, violations of EEP [1]. These include vi-
olation of the universality of free-fall as well as varia-
tion of fundamental constants with time and space. In-
terestingly, a recent analysis of the spectrum of quasars
[2] suggests that the ﬁne-structure constant α may have
changed over the cosmological timescale (1010 yr). The
Oklo reactor analysis [3, 4] on the other hand puts a
stringent limit to possible variation of α on the geolog-
ical timescale (109 yr). Owing to their high accuracy,
comparisons between atomic frequency standards based
on diﬀerent atomic species and/or types of transitions
provide one of the best ways to perform laboratory tests
of the stability of fundamental constants. Present and
future eﬀorts to improve atomic frequency standards, in
both the optical and the microwave domains, will im-
prove these tests, leading to signiﬁcant constraints on
theoretical work aimed at a uniﬁed theory.

In this letter we describe frequency comparisons con-
ducted over a two-year period between a 199Hg+ single-
ion optical clock and a 133Cs fountain atomic clock that
set a new stringent limit to a possible variation of funda-
mental constants. The theoretical background for such a
test is given ﬁrst. We then describe the experiment and
conclude with the results of the test.

In the experiment, the frequency νHg of the 199Hg+
5d106s 2S1/2(F = 0) ←→ 5d96s2 2D5/2(F = 2, mF = 0)
electric-quadrupole transition at λ = 282 nm is compared
to the frequency νCs of the ground-state hyperﬁne tran-
sition 6S1/2(F = 3, mF = 0) ←→ 6S1/2(F = 4, mF = 0)
in neutral 133Cs. Including relativistic and many-body
eﬀects, νHg can be expressed as νHg ≃ Ry FHg(α), where
Ry = R∞c is the Rydberg constant expressed as a fre-
quency, and FHg(α) is a dimensionless function of the

ﬁne-structure constant α = e2/4πε0~c. Similarly, the
hyperﬁne frequency of cesium can be approximated by
νCs ≃ gCs(me/mp)α2Ry FCs(α), where gCs is the gyro-
magnetic ratio of the 133Cs nucleus and me/mp the
electron-to-proton mass ratio. FHg(α) and FCs(α) are
calculated in [5, 6]. With numerical values from [6], we
ﬁnd

Therefore, sequential measurements of the ratio νCs/νHg
actually test the stability of the product of fundamental
constants gCs(me/mp)α6.0. Note that the sensitivity to
variation of the individual constants needs to be known
to only 1-10 % in order to adequately describe how this
comparison constrains possible variations of these funda-
mental constants. It is therefore justiﬁed to omit higher-
order terms in the expression of the hyperﬁne splitting
of 133Cs, such as ﬁnite nuclear size. The high sensitiv-
ity of the Hg+ vs Cs frequency comparison to a change
of α arises from the large relativistic eﬀects encountered
in heavy atoms combined with the negative sign of the
relativistic eﬀects in 199Hg+. These factors make the
199Hg+ 2S1/2 ←→ 2D5/2 optical transition one of the
best choices for a search of a variation of α [6].

The 199Hg+ single-ion optical frequency standard has
been described previously [7, 8] and only the main fea-
tures are outlined here. A single 199Hg+ ion is stored
in a radio-frequency (rf) spherical Paul trap held at a
cryogenic temperature (4.2 K). It is laser-cooled to near
the 1.7 mK Doppler limit using the strongly allowed
2S1/2(F = 1) ←→ 2P1/2(F = 0) transition at 194 nm,
as shown in Fig. 1. After a cooling and state prepara-
tion phase (∼ 16 ms), the ion is left in the 2S1/2(F = 0)
lower state of the clock transition. The cooling laser is
then switched oﬀ and the probe laser light at 282 nm is
directed onto the ion for a typical duration of T = 50 ms.

level scheme of 199Hg+. The 194 nm
FIG. 1: Partial
2S1/2(F = 1) ←→ 2P1/2(F = 0) transition is used
for Doppler cooling, state preparation and detection. The
282 nm electric-quadrupole transition from the ground state
2S1/2(F = 0) to the metastable 2D5/2(F = 2, mF = 0) state
provides the reference for the optical clock frequency.

The cooling laser is turned on again to determine the
ion’s internal state using the technique of electron shelv-
ing [9, 10]. The 194 nm ﬂuorescence photons emitted by
the ion are counted for 15 ms. The absence of scattered
photons indicates that the ion has been excited to the
2D5/2(F = 2) state by the 282 nm probe laser. Simi-
larly, a typical count rate of ∼ 6000 s−1 from the ion
indicates that it has remained in the 2S1/2(F = 0) state
after the probe period. When the ion is detected in the
2D5/2 excited state, the 194 nm is left on until scattered
photons are detected again, indicating that the ion has
spontaneously decayed to the 2S1/2 state. A new inter-
rogation cycle is then started.

The 282 nm radiation used to probe the clock transi-
tion is obtained by frequency-doubling 563 nm light from
a dye laser in a deuterated ammonium dihydrogen phos-
phate (AD⋆P) crystal, as shown in Fig. 2. The light
from the dye laser is stabilized to a resonance of a sta-
ble high-ﬁnesse (F ∼ 200 000) Fabry-P´erot cavity. Two
acousto-optic modulators (AOM1,AOM2) driven by pre-
cision rf sources shift and ﬁne-tune the frequency of the
563 nm radiation so as to match the frequency of the
282 nm radiation to the S − D resonance frequency. By
compensating the predictable linear drift of the stable
reference cavity (∼ 500 mHz s−1) using AOM1, we real-
ize an interrogation oscillator with a fractional frequency
instability of 3 × 10−16 between 1 s and 10 s, corre-
sponding to a linewidth of 640 mHz at 282 nm [7]. For
a typical probe time T = 50 ms, which is shorter than
the 90 ms spontaneous decay time of the 2D5/2 state,
the observed linewidth is Fourier-transform limited with
a full width at half maximum of ∼ 16 Hz, much larger
than the frequency ﬂuctuations of the probe laser during
the probe pulse time. Under these conditions, the ﬂuctu-
ations of the measured transition probability, and hence
the frequency stability of the Hg+ frequency standard,
are limited mainly by atomic quantum projection noise

2

[11].

In our trap, the radial and axial secular frequencies are
1.1 MHz and 2.2 MHz respectively. Both frequencies are
much higher than the recoil frequency ν = h/2mλ2 ≈
12.6 kHz, where m is the ion mass and h is the Planck
constant. The observed spectrum therefore consists of
a central feature at the 2S1/2(F = 0) ←→ 2D5/2(F =
2, mF = 0) transition resonance frequency, which is free
of the recoil frequency shift, together with vibrational
sidebands at integer multiples of the trap secular fre-
quencies [10]. The spectrum also exhibits features corre-
sponding to the carrier and vibrational sidebands of the
2S1/2(F = 0) ←→ 2D5/2(F = 2, mF = ±1, ±2) “Zee-
man components.” Typically, the frequency diﬀerence
between the clock transition and the ﬁrst Zeeman com-
ponents is ∼ 6 MHz, which corresponds to a quantization
magnetic ﬁeld B ≈ 0.3 mT.

In order to lock the frequency of the probe laser to
the atomic resonance, a square-wave frequency modula-
tion is applied to the 563 nm beam using AOM2 so as
to probe the carrier of the clock transition alternately
on each side of the resonance. Typically, 24 measure-
ments are averaged on each side of the resonance to ﬁnd
the transition probability. The diﬀerence between these
two transition probabilities reveals the detuning between
the center frequency of the probe laser and the center
of the atomic resonance. This error signal is used in a
digital servo loop that steers the average frequency of
the probe laser to the center of the atomic resonance,
applying frequency corrections to the synthesizer driv-
ing AOM1. The time constant of this servo loop is on
the order of τloop ∼ 15 s. The analysis of the frequency

corrections indicates that for τ > τloop, the fractional
frequency instability of the probe light stabilized to the
atomic resonance is 5 − 7 × 10−15 τ −1/2, in good agree-
ment with the quantum-limited instability expected for
our experimental conditions (trap secular frequencies, ion
temperature and measurement cycle time).

In order to compare the Hg+ optical frequency stan-
dard to other frequency standards, some fraction of the
563 nm light at the output of AOM1 is launched into
a 180 m long optical ﬁber and delivered into a separate
room where it is frequency shifted by AOM3. AOM3 is
used to actively cancel the optical path length ﬂuctua-
tions of the ﬁber in order to preserve the high degree of
coherence of the light [12, 13].

The frequency of the 563 nm light is measured with
an optical frequency comb generated by a mode-locked
Ti:Sapphire laser whose femtosecond pulses are spec-
trally broadened in a microstructure ﬁber [14, 15, 16, 17].
The optical spectrum at the output of the ﬁber consists
of equally spaced, phase-coherent modes with frequen-
cies fn = nfr + f0, where fr is the repetition rate of
the mode-locked laser, n is an integer and f0 is a fre-
quency oﬀset caused by the diﬀerence between the phase
In our setup,
and group velocities in the laser cavity.
the repetition rate is typically fr ∼ 1 GHz and the spec-
trum spans more than one octave from ∼ 520 nm to
1170 nm. The repetition rate is detected directly with a
fast photodiode. The oﬀset frequency f0 is detected by
the self-referencing method, where the frequency-doubled
red part of the comb 2fn = 2nfr + 2f0 is heterodyned
with the blue part of the comb f2n = 2nfr + f0. We
also detect the beatnote fb between the 563 nm light
from the Hg+ optical frequency standard and the closest
mode of the optical frequency comb fm = mfr + f0 (m
is known from previous coarse measurements of the Hg+
S − D transition frequency). In practice, f0 and fb are
phase-locked to precision rf sources by acting on the cav-
ity length and the pump power of the femtosecond laser,
respectively. Finally, fr is measured by counting the low-
frequency beatnote between fr and a third rf synthesizer.
In order to perform absolute optical frequency mea-
surements in terms of the SI second, all synthesizers and
frequency counters are referenced to the 5 MHz output
of a hydrogen maser with a typical frequency instability
∼ 2 × 10−13 at 1 s. The maser itself is part of an ensem-
ble of 5 masers and 3 commercial cesium clocks used to
realize the local NIST atomic time scale, which is in turn
periodically calibrated using the NIST-F1 cesium foun-
tain primary standard [18], as well as international ce-
sium standards. The frequency of the reference hydrogen
maser is known within 1.8 parts in 1015 with respect to
the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting of 133Cs. As shown
in recent investigations [19, 20], the additional noise and
inaccuracy from the optical frequency comb itself is neg-
ligible at this level. Using this setup, it is thus possible
to perform absolute measurements of the frequency of

3

the Hg+ optical standard (together with the frequency
of each component of the optical comb) with a fractional
frequency uncertainty of 1.8×10−15. Typically, measure-
ments are performed for 2 hours, leading to a statistical
(type A) fractional frequency uncertainty of 2.4 parts in
1015, which corresponds to a 2.5 Hz uncertainty on the
frequency of the 282 nm stabilized light.

Z B2, K (2)

The full evaluation of all systematic eﬀects of the Hg+
optical standard is still under way. At the present time,
10 Hz is a conservative upper bound for the total sys-
tematic (type B) uncertainty, as shown by the following
preliminary analysis of systematic shifts. The second-
order Zeeman frequency shift of the clock transition is
given by δνZ = K (2)
Z = −18.925(28) kHz mT−2
[21]. The typical ﬁeld B ≈ 0.3 mT corresponds to a
second-order Zeeman frequency shift δνZ ∼ −1.7 kHz.
Therefore, the 1.5 × 10−3 fractional uncertainty on co-
eﬃcient K (2)
Z leads to a 2.6 Hz uncertainty on the clock
frequency. For the same value of the bias magnetic ﬁeld,
the sensitivity of the clock frequency to ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
is 11 Hz µT−1. In our unshielded environment, B-ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations up to ±0.2 µT have been observed, leading
to a 2.2 Hz uncertainty. The most troublesome frequency
shift is the electric-quadrupole shift δνQ due to the cou-
pling between the atomic electric-quadrupole moment in
the upper 2D5/2(F = 2, mF = 0) clock state with electric
ﬁeld gradients due, for example, to stray charges on the
trap electrodes. From our trap geometry and the bias
voltages applied to compensate for stray electric ﬁelds, it
is possible to calculate an upper bound for an electric ﬁeld
gradient at the location of the ion and to estimate that
δνQ < 1 Hz [21].
In addition, two successive versions
of the trap electrodes (gold and molybdenum surfaces)
have been used, leading to no detectable change of the
clock frequency. Similarly, the background pressure of
helium (the only species remaining with signiﬁcant pres-
sure at 4.2 K) has been changed by more than one or-
der of magnitude (estimated by measuring the ion heat-
ing rate due to background collisions) without producing
any detectable frequency shift. Empirically, this implies
that the He background pressure shift is smaller than
1 Hz. At a temperature of 300 K, the black-body radia-
tion shift is −0.08 Hz, and it is considerably lower in the
4.2 K cryogenic environment [21]. At the Doppler cool-
ing limit of 1.7 mK, the second-order Doppler shift due to
thermal motion is −0.003 Hz. Finally, by suitably com-
pensating the stray static electric ﬁeld, systematic shifts
related to the trapping oscillating electric ﬁeld (second-
order Doppler shift due to micromotion, AC Stark shift)
are made smaller than 0.1 Hz [22].

Over a period of two years, we have performed 20
measurements of the 199Hg+ S − D transition frequency
with respect to the 133Cs ground state hyperﬁne split-
ting. Figure 3 shows these measurements, corrected for
the second-order Zeeman frequency shift, with their sta-

tistical (type A) error bars. The absolute frequency of
the Hg+ optical standard is given by the weighted av-
erage of these data: νHg = 1 064 721 609 899 143.4 Hz.
The total statistical uncertainty is only 1.0 Hz. Measure-
ments in Fig. 3 clearly show a reproducibility better than
10 Hz at 1.06×1015 Hz, the most stringent comparison of
optical and microwave frequencies to date. The total un-
certainty of the measurement is dominated by the 10 Hz
systematic uncertainty of the Hg+ clock. With a 10−14
fractional uncertainty and a measurement period of two
years, our measurement constrains a possible fractional
variation of νCs/νHg at the level of ±7 × 10−15 yr−1 (1σ
uncertainty).

This result can be interpreted as constraining a pos-
sible fractional variation of gCs(me/mp)α6.0 at the same
level: ±7 × 10−15 yr−1. Assuming that any change in
this quantity is due to the α6.0 factor, we derive an upper
bound for a possible linear variation of the ﬁne-structure
| ˙α/α| < 1.2 × 10−15 yr−1, a factor of 30 im-
constant:
provement over [5]. However, there may be a signiﬁ-
cant change of gCs or me/mp due to possible variation of
the strength of the strong and electroweak interactions.
In fact, recent theoretical work argues that within the
framework of a grand uniﬁed theory a fractional varia-
tion of α is necessarily accompanied by a fractional vari-
ation of me/mp that is ∼ 38 times larger [23]. Fortu-
nately, comparisons between two optical clocks will test
the stability of α alone [6]. One interesting possibility is
to compare the 199Hg+ S − D transition to the 657 nm
1S0(m = 0) ←→ 3P1(m = 0) transition in neutral 40Ca
[14, 24]. With an independent constraint to the stability
of α, comparisons involving hyperﬁne transitions, such

4

as the present νHg (optical) vs νCs comparison or the
νRb (microwave) vs νCs comparison [25, 26], will test the
stability of the strong and electroweak interactions. Ref-
erence [27] investigates in more detail possible laboratory
tests of the stability of fundamental constants.

Reevaluation of the role of nuclear uncertainties in experiments on atomic parity
violation with isotopic chains

(Dated: July 14, 2011)

In light of new data on neutron distributions from experiments with antiprotonic atoms [ Trzcinska
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 082501 (2001)], we reexamine the role of nuclear-structure uncertainties
in the interpretation of measurements of parity violation in atoms using chains of isotopes of the
same element. With these new nuclear data, we ﬁnd an improvement in the sensitivity of isotopic
chain measurements to “new physics” beyond the standard model. We compare possible constraints
on “new physics” with the most accurate to date single-isotope probe of parity violation in the Cs
atom. We conclude that presently isotopic chain experiments employing atoms with nuclear charges
Z <

∼ 50 may result in more accurate tests of the weak interaction.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic parity non-conservation [1, 2] (PNC) provides powerful constraints on extensions to the standard model of
elementary particles in the low-energy electroweak sector. For example, a deviation in the observed weak charge of
an atomic nucleus, QW , from the prediction of the standard model may hint at the existence of extra neutral-gauge
Z-boson. Other possible “new physics” scenarios are discussed, e.g., in Ref. [3].

The most accurate to date measurement of atomic PNC has been carried out by Wieman and co-workers [4, 5]
using a single isotope of atomic cesium, 133Cs. In such measurements one determines a parity-violating signal EPNC,
related to the weak charge as EPNC = kPNC QW . The parameter kPNC is supplied from sophisticated atomic-structure
calculations. Even for the relatively well-understood univalent Cs atom, the accuracy of the calculation of kPNC
remains the limiting factor in the determination of the weak charge.

There is an ongoing discussion in the literature [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] about whether the 133Cs weak charge
deviates from the prediction of the standard model. This possible deviation may be interpreted as an indication for
an extra neutral-gauge boson Z ′ [13, 14]; there were numerous discussions in the literature about implications of the
possible deviation. It is clear that independent tests of parity violation in atoms are required at least at the level of
the present 1% accuracy for Cs. It is worth mentioning that PNC measurements were also carried out in Tl [15, 16],
Pb [17], and Bi (see, e. g., [18]). Among these, the simplest atom is Tl, but even for Tl the theoretical uncertainty
for kPNC is a factor of a few larger than that for Cs [19, 20].

An alternative approach allowing one to circumvent the diﬃculties of atomic-structure calculations was proposed
by Dzuba et al. [21]. The main idea was to form a ratio
of PNC amplitudes for two isotopes of the same element,
R
thus cancelling out associated uncertainties of the atomic theory. However, Fortson et al. [22] pointed out a conceptual
limitation of this method – an enhanced sensitivity of possible constraints on “new physics” to uncertainties in the
neutron distributions. As an example, the diﬀerences between neutron and proton root-mean-square radii for 133Cs
diﬀer by a factor of four in relativistic and non-relativistic nuclear-structure calculations and depend on nuclear
models. Unfortunately, at the present level of theoretical understanding of neutron distributions, such large nuclear-
structure uncertainties would preclude an extraction of useful information on weak interactions from isotopic ratios
measured for heavy atoms.

Given the inadequate accuracy of nuclear-structure calculations for the analysis of PNC measurements based on
isotopic ratios, here we investigate the role of uncertainties in neutron distributions using empirical data. Recently,
Trzcinska et al. [23] deduced diﬀerences between root-mean-square radii Rn and Rp of neutron and proton distributions
from experiments with antiprotonic atoms. A wide range of stable nuclei were investigated and the diﬀerences were

Here ∆Rnp = Rn −
to estimate the nuclear-structure uncertainty for parity-violating amplitude in Cs [10]. In light of the new nuclear
data we reexamine the suitability of isotopic chain measurements for studies of parity violation in atoms. We ﬁnd
that the nuclear-structure uncertainty in possible probes of “new physics” with isotopic chains is reduced by the new
antiprotonic-atom data. We compare constraints on the direct “new physics” with what is currently the most accurate
single-isotope probe of parity violation in 133Cs. We conclude that presently isotopic chain experiments with atoms
having Z <
∼

50 may be competitive with this single-isotope determination.

More sophisticated expressions may be found in Ref. [26], but the accuracy of the above formula is suﬃcient for the
goals of the present work. We omitted radiative corrections in the deﬁnition of the weak charge, Eq. (4). These
contributions are important in the studies of “oblique” corrections, discussed, e.g., in Ref. [25, 27]. Here, motivated
by possible deviation of the Cs weak charge from the prediction of standard model, we analyze constraints on direct
tree-level “new physics”. The term ∆Qnew in Eq. (4) characterizes “new physics”. Following Ramsey-Musolf [28], we
represent it as a combination of couplings to up (u) and down (d) quarks, i.e.

where hp = 2hu + hd and hn = 2hd + hu are couplings to protons and neutrons. Various elementary-particle scenarios
for these interactions were reviewed in Ref. [28]. Finally,

As an outcome of the analysis of PNC experiments one would like to set bounds on “new physics” couplings hp, hn

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We assume below that in Eq. (13) the experimental errors δ

may be neglected in comparison to nuclear-structure
uncertainty. By contrast to the previous discussions [22, 25, 28] of atomic parity-violation in isotope chains we employ
the empirical Eq. (1) to estimate radii of neutron distributions; this relation was deduced from experiments with
antiprotonic atoms [23]. To estimate the error bar in the diﬀerences ∆Rnp −

pairs from the original 21 point data set of Ref. [23] and obtained with the least-square method ∆R′

obtained (statistical) error bars are very small. However, given insuﬃcient information on systematic errors in [23],
in our subsequent analysis we retained more conservative uncertainties from Eq. (1). Based on error bars in Eq. (1)

compiled in Table I, it is clear that the present nuclear-structure uncertainty still may cloud a competitive extraction
of “new physics” from isotopic chain experiments for these atoms. Compared to single-isotope 133Cs determination,
measurements with isotopes of Ba and Sm would be two times less sensitive to extra neutral-gauge Z-bosons and
would have a comparable sensitivity to new isoscalar physics (see Eq. (16).) Possible constraints from heavier Yb and

is in the order of 0.3% for Ba and Sm, 0.2% for Yb, and

So far the most accurate measurement of parity-violating amplitude was carried out in Cs [4]; the achieved accuracy
was 0.35%. As ﬁrst noted by Bouchiat and Bouchiat [36], the matrix elements of the weak interaction scale as Z 3;
the parity-violating amplitude may be weaker for atoms with nuclear charges Z <
50 which are lighter than Cs
∼
(Z = 55). However, the required experimental error in ratios of PNC amplitudes, Eq. (17), is less demanding for
lighter atoms. Also an enhancement of PNC amplitude may arise due to an admixture to the initial/ﬁnal atomic state
of an energetically close intermediate state of an opposite parity by the weak interaction. For example, calculations
[37, 38] demonstrated that the PNC amplitude for the 6s2 1S0
5d 6s 3D1 transition in Yb is approximately 100
times larger than in Cs.

We conclude that at the present level of understanding of neutron distributions, atoms with nuclear charges Z <
50
∼
may be suitable for competitive tests of parity violation with isotopic ratios. If parity-violating enhancement scenarios
would be realized for such atoms, the experiments may become feasible. It is worth carrying out a systematic search
for enhanced PNC amplitudes for atoms and ions with Z <
50. Such an atomic-structure search is certainly a
∼
nontrivial task, requiring in most of the cases an accurate account of correlations. For example, Xiaxing et al. [39]
5d7s 3D1 transition in Ba is an order of magnitude larger than in
argued that the PNC amplitude for the 6s2 1S0
→
Cs. Their semi-empirical calculation was based on assumption that an intermediate state 6s7p 1P o
1 , which is only 258
cm−1 deeper than 5d7s 3D1 state, provides the main contribution to the PNC amplitude. To verify their conclusion,
we have carried out the accurate calculation of this amplitude with combined method of conﬁguration interaction and
many-body perturbation theory [40]. Our determination resulted in the PNC amplitude 30 times smaller than the
prediction [39]. The main reason for the discrepancy is the strong interaction of the conﬁgurations forming 5d7s 3D1
and 6s7p 1P o
1 states which was not accounted for in Ref. [39]. This conﬁguration interaction leads to signiﬁcant
cancellations of diﬀerent contributions to the matrix element
and decreases the contribution
to the PNC amplitude by an order of magnitude.

To reiterate, with the new data from experiments with antiprotonic atoms [23] we reevaluated the role of nuclear-
structure uncertainties in the interpretation of atomic parity violation with chains of isotopes of the same element.
We ﬁnd that the nuclear-structure uncertainty is reduced by these new data. We compared possible constraints on the
direct “new physics” with the most accurate to date single-isotope probe of parity violation in Cs atom. We conclude
that presently isotopic chain experiments with atoms having Z <
50 may be competitive with this single-isotope
∼
determination. As the neutron distribution measurements become more reﬁned (see, e.g., Ref. [41]) we expect that
competitive probes of parity violation with isotopic ratios of the same element may become feasible for heavier atoms.

Atomic Clocks and the Search for Variation of the Fine Structure Constant

Evidence that the ﬁne structure constant, α = e2/¯hc, was diﬀerent in an early epoch has recently
been found in quasar (QSO) absorption spectra. An accurate laboratory measurement of α variation
could help to distinguish between space and time variation of α and possibly conﬁrm the QSO results.
We have performed calculations of the relativistic energy shifts that a variation of α would cause in
a wide range of atomic spectra. A laboratory measurement of how these transition frequencies vary
over time is vital in determining whether α is varying today.

INTRODUCTION

Currently there is a lot of debate about whether the
ﬁne structure constant, α, is varying. Several theories
including Kaluza-Klein theories and string theories allow
or even require α variation. These theories are higher-
dimensional theories, our four dimensional constants de-
pend upon the value of some scalar ﬁelds and on the
structure and sizes of the extra dimensions. Any evolu-
tion of the size of the higher dimensions with time could
lead to a spacetime variation of our four dimensional con-
stants. An excellent review by Uzan [1] describes the the-
ories that predict spacetime variation of constants as well
as current limits on variation of these constants. There is
evidence that other constants are also varying, for exam-
ple it has been found that the deuteron binding energy
has changed since the big bang [2]. Conﬁrmation of α
variation would be exciting since it would indicate new
physics beyond the standard model.

Various methods have been applied to obtain a limit
on α variation. Diﬀerent methods span diﬀerent time
periods and so a comparison of the diﬀerent constraints
will lead to a picture of when and if α has varied. One of
these methods involves the Okolo uranium mine, which
is situated in Gabon in west Africa. It contained a nat-
ural ﬁssion reactor that was active 1.8 million years ago.
The present isotopic abundances allow the reaction rates,
while the ﬁssion reactor was active, to be extracted.
This in turn allows a bound on changes in α to be ex-
tracted. The most recent limit obtained in this way is
∆α/α ≥ 4.5 × 10−8 (6σ conﬁdence)[3], where ∆α is the
change in α since the ﬁssion reactor was active, this cor-
responds to a redshift, z ∼ 0.14. One of the problems
with a limit on α variation obtained in this way is that
there are a number of assumptions made in deriving the
value.

Another method is to analyse QSO spectra to see
whether α was diﬀerent in the past. The big advantage
of using QSOs is that they are situated at relatively large
redshifts, z ∼ 0.5 − 3.5 and so studying them allows us
to peer into the ancient history of the universe. This is
a big advantage since if α was varying steadily through
time we would expect to see the largest change in the
oldest spectral lines. Alternatively, if α varied suddenly,

then since this data spans a larger percentage of the uni-
verse’s history, the time at which α varied is more likely
to be contained within this data. Several groups are cur-
rently working on obtaining limits on α variation from
QSO spectra. There is some discrepancy among the re-
sults obtained by the diﬀerent groups. The current limits
on α obtained in this manner are shown in the Table I.
Several atomic clock type experiments have placed lim-
its on present day α variation. These experiments do not
yet match the precision of the QSO limits. The most
precise limit obtained to date is | ˙α/α| < 1.2 × 10−15/yr.
This was obtained by Bize et al.
[7] using a frequency
comb with a Hg+ optical clock and a Cs microwave clock.
It has been suggested by Nguyen et al.
[8] that a sen-
sitivity of | ˙α/α| < 1.2 × 10−18/yr could be reached by
using the accidentally degenerate levels in Dysprosium,
as suggested in [9]. More laboratory experiments are vi-
tal in order to place stringent limits on present day α
variation. Laboratory experiments are very sensitive to
oscillatory variation of α, this may be missed using other
methods that involve comparing the values of α over a
longer time period.

II. THEORY

The basic concept behind using atomic clocks to mea-
sure a variation in α is that diﬀerent atomic transitions
depend diﬀerently upon α. Comparing the rates of dif-
ferent atomic clocks over long periods of time allows one
to put bounds on the local change of α with time.
In
deciding which atomic transitions to use several factors
need to be taken into account; these factors include the
lifetime of the level (and hence the width of the level),
and the size of the relativistic eﬀects in the level. An
ideal situation would be to have two atomic clocks, each
with a very narrow transition width, with very diﬀerent
relativistic eﬀects.
If α was varying these levels would
then drift either apart or towards each other and this
drift should be measurable over a long enough period of
time.

We have performed calculations to determine how fast
atomic levels will move apart in the presence of α vari-
ation. To do this accurate relativistic calculations are

where x = (α/α0)2 − 1, ω0 is the initial value of ω and α0
is the initial value of α, q is a coeﬃcient that determines
the frequency dependence on α variation. The value of
the q coeﬃcients for many transitions of interest for an
atomic clock style experiment are presented in Table II.
Ideally one would use two levels with very diﬀerent q
coeﬃcients. If the q coeﬃcients have opposite sign the
levels will drift in opposite directions. Alternatively if
you choose a level with a small q coeﬃcient this could
act as an anchor against which the movement of another
level could be measured.

To ﬁnd the value of the q coeﬃcients we have repeated
calculations of the energy levels for diﬀerent values of α.
We start the calculations from the relativistic Hartree-
Fock (also known as Dirac-Hartree-Fock) method. We
then use the combination of the conﬁguration interac-
tion (CI) method with the many-body perturbation the-
ory (MBPT) [10, 11]. Interactions between valence elec-
trons are treated using the CI method while correlations
between the valence electrons and the core electrons are

III. CONCLUSION

Obtaining limits on the variation of fundamental con-
stants is a very active and exciting topic of research since
it can indicate new physics beyond the standard model.
Experiments need to be conducted to place limits on the
variation of constants. To measure the variation of α in
a laboratory the relative movement of two atomic energy
levels with diﬀerent q coeﬃcients needs to be precisely
measured over a period of time. Note that if one mea-
sures absolute frequency variation using the Cs hyper-
ﬁne frequency standard then the dependence of the Cs
frequency on α, calculated in [10], and on (mq/ΛQCD)
where mq is the quark mass and ΛQCD is the strong in-
teraction (QCD) scale, calculated in [15] must be taken
into account.

Radiative charge transfer lifetime
of the excited state of (NaCa)+

New experiments were proposed recently to investigate the regime of cold atomic and molecular
ion-atom collision processes in a special hybrid neutral-atom–ion trap under high vacuum conditions.
The collisional cooling of laser pre-cooled Ca+ ions by ultracold Na atoms is being studied. Modeling
this process requires knowledge of the radiative lifetime of the excited singlet A1Σ+ state of the
(NaCa)+ molecular system. We calculate the rate coeﬃcient for radiative charge transfer using
a semiclassical approach. The dipole radial matrix elements between the ground and the excited
states, and the potential curves were calculated using Complete Active Space Self-Consistent ﬁeld
and M¨oller-Plesset second order perturbation theory (CASSCF/MP2) with an extended Gaussian
basis, 6-311+G(3df). The semiclassical charge transfer rate coeﬃcient was averaged over a thermal
Maxwellian distribution. In addition we also present elastic collision cross sections and the spin-
−16 cm3/sec,
exchange cross section. The rate coeﬃcient for charge transfer was found to be 2.3 × 10
while those for the elastic and spin-exchange cross sections were found to be several orders of
magnitude higher. This conﬁrms our assumption that the milli-Kelvin regime of collisional cooling
of calcium ions by sodium atoms is favorable with the respect to low loss of calcium ions due to the
charge transfer.

Recently, we proposed experiments on simultaneously
cooling and trapping ions and atoms in the same conﬁned
space [1]. The proposed experiments will investigate the
regime of cold atomic and molecular ion-atom collision
processes in a special hybrid neutral-atom–ion trap un-
der high vacuum collisions. The idea is to use the tech-
niques of laser cooling, trapping and manipulation of cold
neutral atoms to make a refrigerator for the sympathetic
cooling of an overlapping sample of atomic or molecu-
lar ions to very low temperatures. We intend to probe
fundamental collision processes and cooling kinetics in as
low a temperature range as possible.

The hybrid trap we are building consists of a conven-
tional magneto-optic neutral atom trap (MOT) combined
with a linear Paul radiofrequency quadruple trap. The
linear Paul trap, with longitudinal electrostatic conﬁne-
ment, is chosen so as to suppress most of the micromotion
and r.f. heating associated with conventional Paul traps
[2].

To calculate the cross sections and rate coeﬃcients for
the charge transfer and the elastic and spin-exchange col-
lisions we have performed ab initio calculations of the
adiabatic potential curves for (NaCa)+ molecular sys-
tem in the X1Σ+, a3Σ+ and A1Σ+ states, which go
asymptotically to the ground (Na++Ca) and excited
(Ca++Na(3s)) states of the ion-atom quasimolecular sys-
tem. The method used was second order M¨oller-Plesset
perturbation theory (MP2) using a Gaussian triple
zeta+diﬀuse+polarization basis set, 6-311+G(3df). This
basis set included three sets of d-polarization functions

∗Electronic address: Oleg.Makarov@UConn.edu

and one set of f -polarization functions in addition to
a diﬀuse function on each atomic center. The ﬁrst ex-
cited A1Σ+ state was optimized for the second root of a
CASSCF (Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field)
using eight orbitals in the active space. This was followed
with an MP2 (M¨oller-Plesset second order perturbation
theory) correction to the optimized CASSCF energy.

Figure 1 shows the potential curves of the ground and
excited states of (NaCa)+ molecular system in atomic
units (a.u.). The curves were obtained by performing
a cubic spline ﬁt to the calculated points. At small in-
ternuclear separations R, the potential curves were ap-
proximated with the short-range potential of the form

require the exact knowledge of the dipole radial matrix
elements at smaller distances. At small distances there
is little overlap between the wavefunctions of the ground
and excited states for the energies of the approaching
sodium atoms considered here. At milli-Kelvin energies
of the sodium atoms, the classical turning point R0 was
found to be always to the right of R = 8 a0.

The rate coeﬃcient for radiative charge transfer may
be expressed as an integral of the transition probability
over the collision path, averaged over the initial velocities
and the impact parameters [4]. The semiclassical cross
section may be expressed as [5]

Ref. [3]. The cross sections are approximated by power
law functions of energy for the temperature range down
to µK. Figures 3 - 5 show the calculated collision cross
sections together with the power law ﬁts. The ﬁgures
show that the power law ﬁts are valid at temperatures
1–10 µK and higher, which validates the semiclassical
approach to calculating the rate coeﬃcients for elastic
and spin-exchange collisions.

The elastic collision cross sections ﬁt the expression
σ(E) = CelE−1/3, where Cel = 5310 and 5070 for
the singlet A1Σ+ and triplet a3Σ+ states, respectively,
and the spin-exchange cross section ﬁts the expression
σ(E) = CseE−1/2, where Cse = 44. The coeﬃcients were
obtained by performing a linear ﬁt of the cross sections
plotted on a log-log scale in the energy range above 1 µK.
All quantities are expressed in atomic units. Again, as in
the case of radiative charge transfer rate coeﬃcient, the

In conclusion, we have shown that the semiclassical
approach to evaluating the rate coeﬃcients is a good
approximation because many partial waves are involved
1 mK. The excited singlet state of the col-
even at
liding molecular system (NaCa)+ is metastable against
radiative charge transfer with the lifetime of the order
of many hours. At the same time, the rates for elastic
collisions and also for spin exchange are much greater,
which provides an eﬃcient mechanism for sympathetic
collisional cooling of calcium ions by sodium atoms in
the meV regime and below. We are setting up an exper-
iment to measure collisional cooling by this mechanism.

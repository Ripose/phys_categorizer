The diﬀerential polarizability, due to near-infrared light at 1126 nm, of the 27Al+ 1S0 → 3P0
transition is measured to be ∆α = 4πǫ0 × (1.6 ± 0.5) × 10−31m3, where ∆α = αP − αS is the
diﬀerence between the excited and ground state polarizabilities. This measurement is combined
with experimental oscillator strengths to extrapolate the diﬀerential static polarizability of the clock
transition as ∆α(0) = 4πǫ0 ×(1.5±0.5)×10−31m3. The resulting room temperature blackbody shift
of ∆ν/ν = −8(3) × 10−18 is the lowest known shift of all atomic transitions under consideration for
optical frequency standards. A method is presented to estimate the diﬀerential static polarizability
of an optical transition, from a diﬀerential light shift measurement.

The blackbody radiation shift [1] is a signiﬁcant
shift in all room temperature atomic frequency stan-
dards, as can be seen in Table I.
It ranges from
|∆ν/ν| ≈ 2 × 10−14 for 133Cs to |∆ν/ν| ≈ 8 × 10−18
for 27Al+, as reported here. In order to reach a sys-
tematic uncertainty of |∆ν/ν| < 10−18, the transi-
tions with a large room temperature blackbody shift
may require a cryogenic operating environment, while
27Al+ merely requires knowledge of the room temper-
ature background with 5 K uncertainty.

We begin with a brief explanation of the blackbody
shift, followed by an estimate of the shift in 27Al+

TABLE I: Room temperature blackbody shifts and uncer-
tainties of various species in use, or under consideration,
as atomic frequency standards. Where no uncertainty is
given, it is unknown. The 199Hg+ optical transition is not
listed, because this standard operates at 4.2 K, where the
blackbody shift is reduced by 107 from the room temper-
ature value.

based only on published oscillator strengths. The un-
certainty in this estimate motivated us to measure the
diﬀerential polarizability of the clock transition due to
near-infrared light. This measurement allows a deter-
mination of the blackbody shift with reduced uncer-
tainty.

A. Blackbody shift

The blackbody shift results from oﬀ-resonant cou-
pling of thermal blackbody radiation to the two states
comprising the clock transition. The scalar polariz-
ability αa of an atomic state a driven by an electric
ﬁeld at frequency ω is

αa(ω) =

me Xi

(1)

with summation over all transitions connecting to
state a with resonant frequency ωi, and oscillator
strength fi. For monochromatic radiation E0 cos ωt,
this polarizability results in a dynamic Stark shift of
∆Ea = − 1

where we integrate over the power spectral density of
the blackbody electric ﬁeld, and ∆α(ω) = αP (ω) −
αS(ω) is the diﬀerence between excited and ground
state polarizabilities. Here we ﬁrst estimate the diﬀer-
ential static polarizability ∆α(0). This result is used
to estimate the diﬀerential polarizability at blackbody
frequencies ∆α(ω) for ω ≈ 2πc/(10 µm).

B. The case of 27Al+

The transitions from the 1S0 and 3P0 states that
have been included in our estimate are listed in Ta-
ble II. Oscillator strengths are taken from the NIST

Atomic Spectra Database [11] where available, and
from the Opacity Project [12] otherwise. From this we
calculate for the 3P0 state αP (0) = 4πǫ0 × 3.65(73) ×
10−30 m3. For the 1S0 state αS(0) = 4πǫ0 ×3.68(78)×
10−30 m3. Thus, ∆α(0) = 4πǫ0 ×(−0.03±1.0)×10−30
m3. The room temperature blackbody spectrum
(Erms = 830 V/m) is centered at 10 µm wavelength.
This corresponds to a frequency ω in Eq. (1), which is
50 times lower than the lowest transition frequency ωi.
We may use the static polarizability without loss of ac-
curacy, and ﬁnd ∆ν = − 1
rms = (0.00±0.06)
Hz, or fractionally ∆ν/ν = (0 ± 6) × 10−17, since
ν ≈ 1.1 × 1015 Hz.
In order to operate Al+ as a
frequency standard with fractional frequency uncer-
tainty below 6 × 10−17, the blackbody shift must be
calibrated experimentally.

C. Near-infrared Stark shift measurement

Ideally, we would measure the shift of the clock
transition due to a known intensity of 10 µm radi-
ation, since the room temperature blackbody ﬁeld is
centered at this wavelength. However, the windows
of our experimental apparatus are opaque to wave-
lengths longer than 3 µm. Instead, we measure the
Stark shift due to near-infrared radiation, and use this
measurement to estimate the blackbody shift.

The output of a ﬁber laser (600 mW with ±200 mW
ﬂuctuations) at 1126 nm was focussed onto an Al+ ion,
and switched on and oﬀ at regular intervals. A stable
ULE reference cavity was simultaneously locked to the
1S0 → 3P0 transition, via an acousto-optic frequency
shifter, and the frequency shift due to the Stark shift-
ing beam was tracked and recorded. These measure-
ments were repeated for various lateral (x,y) displace-
ments of the Stark shifting beam, as shown in Figure
1, in order to estimate the beam waist (w0 = 100 ± 10
µm).

D. Extrapolation to zero frequency

The following relates this measurement to the dif-
ferential polarizability at 0 Hz, by expanding Eq. (1)
in small parameters. Two facts speciﬁc to Al+ are
used.

1. All strong transitions connecting to either clock

state are in the deep UV (λ < 186 nm).

2. The strongest transitions contributing to the
sum in Eq. (1) are near each other (λ ≈ 170
nm).

FIG. 1: Clock transition Stark shift vs. beam position.
A Gaussian beam proﬁle ﬁt yields w0 = 100 µm for the
beam waist, with a peak shift of -190 Hz.

Let δi ≡ (ω/ωi)2. For the 1S0 and 3P0 states in
Al+, δi < 0.03, when ω = 2πc/(1126 nm). Expanding
Eq. (1) in powers of δi yields

α(ω) = α(0) +

(δi + δ2

i + ...).

Thus, the diﬀerential polarizability between the 1S0

and 3P0 states is

where we sum over all transitions connecting to the
1S0 and 3P0 states. Positive oscillator strengths are
used for the transitions connecting to 3P0, and neg-
ative oscillator strengths are used for the 1S0 transi-
tions.

Now let δ0 ≡ (ω/ω0)2, where ω0 = 2πc/(171 nm),
and let ǫi ≡ δi − δ0. This value of δ0 is chosen because
the strong transitions all lie near 171 nm. Then

All of the terms after the summation sign are small,
as can be seen in Table II. For the strongest transi-
tions ǫi is small, because all strong transitions are near
171 nm. For the weaker transitions fi/ω2
i is small. To
test the merits of this estimate, we propagate the un-
certainties σfi (see Table II) in the various fi via Eq.
(5), which results in an uncertainty in ∆α(0) of

Note that our choice of δ0 minimizes the uncertainty
σ∆α(0). Numerically we ﬁnd σ∆α(0) = 4πǫ0 × 1.7 ×
10−33 m3 ≈ 0.01 × ∆α(2πc/(1126 nm)). Thus, ∆α(0)
can be deduced from our measurement of ∆α(ω) at
1126 nm with an additional uncertainty of 1 %. Eq.
(5) yields ∆α(0) = 4πǫ0 × (1.5 ± 0.5) × 10−31 m3.

E. Estimate of blackbody shift

Since the frequency of blackbody radiation (cen-
tered at 10 µm wavelength) is closer to 0 Hz than
the frequency of the applied 1126 nm radiation, we
expect to relate ∆α(0) to ∆α(2πc/(10 µm)) with
even less uncertainty than our estimate of ∆α(0) from
∆α(2πc/(1126 nm)). As before, we can propagate the
errors σfi through the result. The calculation follows
from Section D and Eq. (2), and we simply write the
room temperature result as

∆ν = −

(∆α(0) × 1.00024),

(7)

or numerically, ∆ν = −0.008(3) Hz.

F. Conclusion

We have measured the diﬀerential polarizability of
the 27Al+ 1S0 → 3P0 clock transition at 1126 nm. We
have also found expressions relating the diﬀerential
polarizabilities at various drive frequencies, in which
the eﬀect of uncertainties in the oscillator strengths
is minimized.
In particular, ∆α(0) is found from
∆α(2πc/(1126 nm)) with 1 % added fractional un-
certainty, while allowing conservative uncertainties of
20 % or larger in the oscillator strengths. From ∆α(0)
we calculate the blackbody shift with negligible added
uncertainty. The fractional room temperature black-
body shift ∆ν/ν = (−8 ± 3) × 10−18 is substantially
lower for the 27Al+ 1S0 → 3P0 transition than for
other atomic frequency standards currently under de-
velopment (see Table I). The uncertainty in this value
could be lowered by improving the power stability of
the 1126 nm Stark shifting laser.

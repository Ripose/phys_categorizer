Feshbach resonances in the presence of inelastic scattering:
threshold behavior and suppression of poles in scattering lengths

Jeremy M. Hutson

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

In the absence of inelastic scattering, Feshbach resonances produce poles in scattering lengths and
very large peaks in elastic cross sections. However, inelastic scattering removes the poles. Even for
quite weak inelastic scattering the peaks in cross sections are dramatically suppressed. A resonant
scattering length is deﬁned to characterize the strength of the resonance, and is shown to be small for
most collisions of ultracold molecules. The results suggest that cross sections for ultracold molecular
inelastic collisions are much less sensitive to details of the potential than has been believed.

A Feshbach resonance [1] occurs when a bound state
of a 2-particle system lies above a dissociation thresh-
old and is coupled to the continuum. Collision proper-
ties show sharp features (peaks and troughs) near the
energy of the resonance. In recent years, Feshbach reso-
nances have come into prominence in the study of ul-
tracold atomic gases.
In these systems the positions
of resonances can often be adjusted using applied mag-
netic ﬁelds, and it is possible to control the interactions
between atoms by tuning resonances to near-zero colli-
sion energy [2, 3, 4]. Magnetic tuning through Feshbach
resonances has been used to produce molecules in both
bosonic and fermionic quantum gases. Long-lived molec-
ular Bose-Einstein condensates of fermion dimers have
been produced, and the ﬁrst signatures of ultracold tri-
atomic and tetraatomic molecules have been observed.
The new capabilities in atomic physics have had impor-
tant applications in other areas:
for example, the tun-
ability of atomic interactions has been used to explore
the crossover between Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) behavior in dilute
gases. There is now great interest in extending the ca-
pabilities from ultracold atomic to molecular systems, to
explore the properties of dipolar quantum gases and de-
velop new forms of quantum control.

Most interpretations of Feshbach resonances have used
concepts from the two-channel model [4], in which the
bound state and the continuum are each represented by
one scattering channel. This captures much of the cru-
cial resonant behavior observed in ultracold atom-atom
scattering. In particular, it predicts that the scattering
length passes through a pole and the elastic scattering
cross section exhibits a very large peak at a zero-energy
resonance. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate
that introducing additional, inelastic, channels has ma-
jor qualitative eﬀects on the collision properties. Even
when coupling to the inelastic channels is quite weak,
the peaks in cross sections are dramatically suppressed.
Analogous eﬀects are known in the theory of photoasso-
ciation [5, 6, 7], but their consequences have not been
appreciated in other contexts. They are particularly im-

portant for the prospect of controlling molecular colli-
sions.

When there is only a single open channel with orbital
angular momentum l, the long-range wavefunction may
be written

ψopen(r) = N k

−1/2r

−1 sin(kr − lπ/2 + δ)

(1)

where δ is the phase shift and the wave vector k is deﬁned
in terms of the kinetic energy Ekin and reduced mass
µ by Ekin = ¯h2k2/2µ.
In the ultracold regime, cross
sections are dominated by s-wave scattering, with l = 0.
The most important parameter is the s-wave scattering
length, given by

The scattering length becomes constant at limitingly low
energy and the elastic cross section is then

For collisions of identical bosons, the factor of 4 is re-
placed by 8. However, the present work will omit such
extra factors of 2.

If there is only one open channel, the behavior of the
phase shift δ is suﬃcient to characterize a resonance. It
follows a Breit-Wigner form as a function of energy,

δ(E) = δbg + tan

−1

ΓE
2(E0 − E) (cid:21)

,

(cid:20)

(4)

where δbg is a slowly varying background term, E0 is
the resonance position and ΓE is its width (in energy
space). The phase shift thus increases sharply by π across
the width of the resonance. The corresponding S matrix
element S = exp(2iδ) describes a circle of radius 1 in the
complex plane. In general the parameters δbg, E0 and
ΓE are weak functions of energy, but this is neglected in
the present work apart from threshold behavior.

As a function of magnetic ﬁeld at constant Ekin, the

phase shift follows a form similar to Eq. 4,

δ(B) = δbg + tan

−1

ΓB
2(B0 − B) (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(5)

The width ΓB is a signed quantity given by ΓB = ΓE/µ0,
where the magnetic moment µ0 is the rate at which the
energy Ethresh of the open-channel threshold tunes with
respect to the resonance energy,

µ0 =

dEthresh

−

dE0

.

ΓB is thus negative if the bound state tunes upwards
through the energy of interest and positive if it tunes
downwards.

In the ultracold regime, the background phase shift
δbg goes to zero as k → 0 according to Eq. 2 (with ﬁnite
abg), but the resonant term still exists. The scattering

The elastic cross section given by Eq. 3 thus shows a
sharp peak of height 4π/k2 at resonance.

The two widths ΓB and ∆B are numerically quite dif-

ferent measures of the resonance width, related by

ΓB = −2abgk∆B.

(8)

At limitingly low energy, ΓB is proportional to k [2] while
∆B is constant.

In the presence of inelastic collisions, the scattering
matrix has elements Sii′ . The diagonal S-matrix element
in the incoming channel 0 may be written in terms of a
complex phase shift δ0 with a positive imaginary part [9],

S00 = exp(2iδ0).

(9)

This can be expressed in terms of a complex scattering
length, a = α − iβ [5, 10], deﬁned by Eq. 2 except that
δ0 is now complex.

The scattering length again becomes constant at limit-
ingly low energy and the elastic and total inelastic cross
sections are then

where k0 is the wave vector in the incoming channel.

When there are several open channels, the quantity
that follows the Breit-Wigner form (4) or (5) is the S-
matrix eigenphase sum [11, 12], which is the sum of

2

phases of the eigenvalues of the S matrix. The eigen-
phase sum is real, unlike the individual phases δi, be-
cause the S matrix is unitary, so that all its eigenvalues
have modulus 1.

Across a resonance, the individual S matrix elements

describe circles in the complex plane [13],

Sii′ (E) = Sbg,ii′ −

igEigEi′
E − E0 + iΓE/2

,

(12)

where gEi is complex. The radius of the circle in Sii′ is
|gEigEi′ |/ΓE and the partial width for channel i is ΓEi =
|gEi|2. As a function of magnetic ﬁeld at constant Ekin,

where gBi = gEi/µ1/2

energy space or magnetic ﬁeld space,

or

ΓB =

where ΓBi = ΓEi/µ0.

(7)

The partial widths for elastic channels (degenerate
with the incoming channel) are proportional to k0 at low
energy. We may deﬁne a reduced partial width γE0 or
γB0 for the incoming channel by

ΓE0 = 2k0γE0

or

ΓB0 = 2k0γB0,

(15)

and the reduced widths are independent of k0 at low en-
ergy. By contrast, the partial widths for inelastic chan-
nels depend on open-channel wavefunctions with large
wave vectors ki and are eﬀectively independent of k0 in
the ultracold regime. If the inelastic partial widths ΓEi
(or ΓBi) are non-zero, they eventually dominate ΓE0 (or
ΓB0) as k0 decreases. The radius of the circle (13) de-
scribed by S00 thus drops linearly to zero as k0 decreases.
This is qualitatively diﬀerent from the behavior in the ab-
sence of inelastic channels.

As a function of magnetic ﬁeld, the scattering length
passes through a pole only if δ0 passes through
π,
corresponding to S00 = −1. If there is any inelastic scat-
tering, ΓB0 < ΓB and this does not occur. Indeed, as
will be seen below, in the presence of inelastic channels
the resonant oscillation in the real part of the scattering
length may be of quite small amplitude.

Such values of |a| occur only when

and thus when ΓB is strongly dominated by ΓB0. Since
ΓB0 is proportional to k0 and the inelastic contributions
ΓBi are independent of k0, there is a lower bound on the
value of k0 at which this occurs. Denoting the sum of

If the background scattering is elastic (abg is real), the

width of the resonance, the real part α of the scattering
length a oscillates about abg by ±ares/2 and the imag-
inary part peaks at β = ares. This is analogous to the
behavior observed when lasers are used to tune scattering
lengths [5, 6, 7]. The general form is

A remarkable feature of Eq. 21 is that the height of the
peak in the inelastic cross section is proportional to ares,
which is inversely proportional to Γinel
B through Eq. 18.
The stronger the inelastic coupling, the smaller the peak
in σtot
inel.

(cid:3)

The results (19) to (21) are valid when k0ares ≪ 1 and
the imaginary part of the background scattering length
is small, βbg ≪ ares. Even if βbg 6≪ ares, the size of the
circle in the S matrix and thus the contribution of the
resonance is governed by ares. Whenever k0ares 6≫ 1, Eq.
7 fails at values of |a| small enough to aﬀect the results
of Eq. 10. Conversely, when k0ares ≫ 1, S00 describes
a circle of radius close to 1 in the complex plane; the
behavior of the scattering length is then well described
by a 2-channel model and the peak in the elastic cross
section is of height ∼ 4π/k2
0.

The present results are particularly important for
molecular collisions, which are generally much more
strongly inelastic than atomic collisions. For molecules
the criterion k0ares ≪ 1 is almost always satisﬁed if in-

work, we will describe numerical tests of the equations
derived here for He + NH(3Σ−) scattering in a magnetic
ﬁeld [14]. Fig. 1 shows the real and imaginary parts of the
scattering length for magnetic tuning across an inelastic
scattering Feshbach resonance in He + NH. Even for this
system, where the inelasticity much weaker than in most
other molecular systems, ares ≈ 9 ˚A and k0ares ≪ 1. The

For atomic collisions, inelastic eﬀects are sometimes
weak enough that a 2-channel model remains accurate.
For example, Donley et al. [15] and Thompson et al. [16]
have produced 85Rb2 molecules by magnetic tuning in
the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance between (f, mf ) =
(2, −2) states of 85Rb near 155 G. The (2, −2) state is not
the lowest in a magnetic ﬁeld, and the molecules can de-
cay by spontaneous spin relaxation to atomic levels with
f = 2 and mf > −2. K¨ohler et al. [17] have used coupled
channel calculations including spin relaxation to charac-
terized the resonance using coupled-channel calculations
and obtained abg = −484.1 a0 and ∆B = 10.65 G. Their
lifetime τ = 32 µs for the bare resonance state corre-
sponds to Γinel
B = ¯h/τ µ0 = 0.090 G. With these param-
eters, ares = 1.14 × 105 a0. The temperature in the ex-
periments of Thompson et al. [16] is 30 nK, correspond-
−1
ing to k0 = 4.3 × 10−4 a
0 . In this system, therefore,
k0ares ≈ 50 and the resonant behavior of the scattering
length and the elastic cross section is well approximated
by a 2-channel model. However, in systems with stronger
coupling, the temperature below which the two-channel
approach fails will be higher because of the requirement
(17). Below this temperature, the resonant peaks will be
washed out. Such eﬀects have been observed, for exam-
ple, in collisions of Sr (2P2) atoms [18].

The considerations described here explain previously
puzzling results obtained in low-energy reactive scatter-
ing. Qu´em´ener et al. [19] and Cvitaˇs et al. [20] have in-
vestigated tuning reactive scattering resonances in Na +
Na2 and Li + Li2 through zero energy by scaling parame-
ters of the potential energy surface, while Bodo et al. [21]
have carried out analogous studies for F + H2 by scal-
ing the reduced mass. Qu´em´ener et al. [19] and Cvitaˇs
et al. [20] found that elastic and inelastic cross sections

oscillate as resonances cross threshold, but that the am-
plitudes of the oscillations decrease substantially with in-
creasing vibrational excitation of the colliding molecules
(as more inelastic channels become accessible) and are
almost smooth for v = 3.

Eqs. (19) to (21) can be adapted to apply to any
parameter λ that tunes scattering resonances across a
threshold. The ratio Γλ0/Γinel
is the same for any such
parameter (and is equal to ΓE0/Γinel
In terms of re-
duced widths γλ0 = Γλ0/2k0 or γE0 = ΓE0/2k0 that are
constant for small k0, the resonant scattering length is

and has the same value for any parameter λ. ares is
thus a universal measure of the strength of a low-energy
resonance, independent of the parameter used to tune it
through a threshold.

In the presence of even moderate anisotropy in the
potential energy surface, the widths ΓE of rotational
Feshbach resonances are typically in the range 10−2 to
10 cm−1 (300 MHz to 300 GHz) [11, 22, 23], although
resonances due to near-dissociation states have smaller
widths [11]. Such inelastic partial widths are essentially
independent of k0. However, the partial width ΓE0 for
the incoming channel is proportional to k0 at low ener-
it is comparable to the inelastic partial widths at
gies:
high kinetic energies but decreases to zero as k0 → 0.
The radius of the circle described by S00 for small k0 is
again 2k0ares. The S matrix element for elastic scatter-
ing, S00, thus describes small circles in the complex plane
as resonances cross threshold, with correspondingly small
oscillations in elastic cross sections.

If the background scattering is strongly inelastic, βbg >

The considerations of the present paper lead to a re-
markable conclusion.
It has been commonly believed
that collision cross sections in the ultracold regime are
extremely sensitive to details of the potential energy sur-
face, and that for molecules these dependences would be
even more limiting than for atoms. The present paper
has shown that this is true only when inelastic processes

are extremely weak. There are some atom-atom systems
where inelastic processes are weak enough for scatter-
ing lengths to reach near-inﬁnite values at zero-energy
resonances. However, for molecular systems it is likely
that inelastic processes will almost always suppress this
behavior, unless they are rigorously forbidden by consid-
erations of energy or symmetry.

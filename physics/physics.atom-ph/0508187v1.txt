Nuclear Structure corrections for Parity Non-conservation in Atomic Ba+ and Ra+

We calculate the binding energy, charge radii in 126Ba–140Ba and 214Ra–228Ra using the relativistic
mean ﬁeld theory which includes scalar and vector mesons. We then evaluate the nuclear structure
corrections to the weak charges for a series of isotopes of these atoms using diﬀerent parameters
and estimate their uncertainty in the framework of this model. Our results will have important
implication for the ongoing and planned parity non-conservation experiments and atomic structure
calculations on Ba+ and Ra+.

×

Parity non-conservation (PNC) in heavy atoms have
provided an important conﬁrmation [1, 2, 3] of the
SU(2)
U(1) electro-weak sector of the Standard Model
(SM). By combining the results of precision measure-
ments and calculations using sophisticated many-body
methods [4, 5, 6], it is possible to extract the nuclear
weak charge and compare with its corresponding value in
the SM. A discrepancy between these two values could
reveal the possible existence of new physics beyond the
SM [7].

As ﬁrst pointed out by Bouchiat and Bouchiat [1], the
matrix element of the PNC Hamiltonian scales as Z 3.
It is primarily because of this reason that heavy atoms
are considered to be the best candidates for PNC exper-
iments. A high precision measurement of PNC in atomic
cesium [3] has reduced signiﬁcantly the uncertainty (<
1%) in the determination of the nuclear weak charge,
QW , of the Cs nucleus and the deviation from the SM is
about 1σ [8]. It would also be desirable to consider other
systems that have the potential to yield accurate values
of the nuclear weak charge. Ba+ and Ra+ deserve spe-
cial mention in this context. The transition of interest
6d2D3/2
are 6s2S1/2 →
for Ra+. An experiment is underway for Ba+ using the
techniques of ion trapping and laser cooling and another
has been proposed for Ra+ [9, 10]. Relativistic many-
body calculations [11, 12] have also been carried out on
these two ions.

5d2D3/2 for Ba+ and 7s2S1/2 →

The experimental result needs input from atomic struc-
ture calculations involving the interplay of electromag-
netic and weak interactions. However, the small but
non-negligible eﬀects of nuclear size must be addressed
before an interpretation of PNC data in terms of the
fundamental electro-weak couplings is possible. Thus nu-
clear structure could become a crucial factor in the in-
terpretation of PNC experiments of increasing accuracy
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. An extensive discussion on the sen-
sitivity of atomic PNC and electric dipole moments to
possible new physics has been recently reported in Ref.
[18].

There have been earlier studies to determine nuclear
structure eﬀects in PNC in atomic cesium using non-
relativistic potentials [15, 16] as well as relativistic mod-
els [17]. In this letter we present a relativistic calculation
of these eﬀects for the Ba and Ra isotopes using the rela-
tivistic mean ﬁeld theory (RMF). It is motivated by the

current eﬀorts to observe PNC in Ba+ and Ra+.

The RMF theory ﬁrst proposed by Teller and co-
workers [19, 20, 21] and later by Walecka [22] and de-
veloped by others has been fairly successfully applied to
both nuclear matter and ﬁnite nuclei. The method gives
good description for binding energies, root mean square
(rms) radii, quadruple and hexadecapole deformations
and other nuclear properties not only for the spherical,
but also for the deformed nuclei. The same parameter set
of the model also describes well the properties of nuclear
matter. One of the major attractive features of the RMF
approach is the incorporation of the spin-orbit interaction
due to to the presence of the one body Dirac Hamilto-
nian and the nuclear shell structure automatically arises
from the nucleon-nucleon interaction via the scalor and
vector mesons. We can therefore expect the RMF calcu-
lation to provide useful information on nuclear structure
corrections to atomic PNC.

In the Standard Model, the electron-nucleon interac-
tion is mediated by both the photon and the intermediate
boson Z 0. The energy involved in the atomic PNC exper-
iments are usually only a fraction of an eV, while the mass
of the Z 0 is
92 GeV, and so the parity non-conserving
interaction may be written as a contact interaction. We

The proton (charge) nuclear form factors needed for qp
are generally well known from the measurements
and
of the charge distribution of nuclei close to the stable
valley and many unstable nuclei as well. The neutron
nuclear form factor needed for qn is not well determined
experimentally and is model dependent. To estimate the
importance of PNC in nuclear structure, the form factor
can be approximated to the order of (Zα)2 for a sharp
nuclear surface, and neglecting the electron mass in com-
parison with the nuclear Coulomb potential [14],

The ﬁeld for the σ-meson is denoted by σ, that of the ω-
meson by ωµ and of the isovector ρ-meson by ~Rµ. Aµ de-
notes the electromagnetic ﬁeld. ψi are the Dirac spinors
for the nucleons, whose third component of isospin is de-
noted by τ3i. Here gs, gω, gρ and e2/4π = 1/137 are
the coupling constants for σ, ω, ρ mesons and photon re-
spectively. M is the mass of the nucleon and mσ, mω and
mρ are the masses of the σ, ω and ρ-mesons respectively.
Ωµν, ~Bµν and F µν are the ﬁeld tensors for the ωµ, ~ρµ
and the photon ﬁelds respectively. The ﬁeld equations for
mesons and nucleons are obtained from the Lagrangian
of equation (15) and can be found in Ref [24]. These are
nonlinear, coupled partial diﬀerential equations, which
are solved self-consistently. These equations are solved
by expanding the upper and lower components of the
Dirac spinors ψi and the boson ﬁelds wave functions in
terms of a deformed harmonic oscillator potential basis.

The total binding energy of the system is

Etot = Epart + Eσ + Eω + Eρ + EC + Epair + Ecm (16)

son energies, and EC and Epair are the coulomb and

We use the parameter set TM1, NL3 and NL-SH [26]
for our calculations. We note that in TM1 parameter set
has the non-negative value of the quartic self-coupling
coeﬃcient g3 for the omega mesons. In most of the suc-
cessful parameter sets the quartic self-coupling term for
sigma meson is negative, so that the energy spectrum is
unbounded below. Although in normal cases the solu-
tions are obtained in local minimum. However, all these
parameter sets give a good account of various proper-
ties such as binding energy, compressibility, asymmetric
energy for nuclear matter.

p,n and δr4

We have calculated the binding energies, charge radius
and shift δr2
p,n for the barium and radium iso-
topes with diﬀerent parameter sets. The binding energies
agree in all the cases with the experimental values with
maximum deviation of 5 to 6 MeV out of a total binding
energy of 1000 MeV for barium isotopes and similarly
for radium isotopes the deviation for binding energies
are around 8 MeV [27]. The charge radii rch agree quite
well with the ﬁtted values [28] for the barium isotopes to
within 1%. The diﬀerence between the root mean squre
radius of neutrons and protons grows almost linearly with
the neutron number for both the barium and radium iso-
topes. This diﬀerence also depends signiﬁcantly on the
theoretical model used. The lack of unambiguous pre-
cise experimental information on the neutron distribution
means that one must extrapolate to the desired neutron
properties. We note that there is essentially no model in-
dependent experimental information on neutron density
distributions. We next use these radii to estimate the
nuclear structure eﬀects in PNC.

The nuclear structure corrections and the weak charge
for diﬀerent isotopes of barium and radium evaluated for
S = T = 0 for diﬀerent parameter sets. Here one can
see that the qp are constant when the neutron number
increases. However qn varies slowly as one increases the
neutron number. Our RMF calculation gives the nuclear
structure correction for 134Ba, Qnuc
W = 3.444 for TM1,
3.453 for NL3 and 3.436 for NL-SH forces. Similarly the
nuclear structure correction for 226Ra are Qnuc
W = 15.240
for TM1, 15.288 for NL3 and 15.215 for NL-SH parame-
ters. In Fig I, we have plotted the nuclear structure cor-
rections versus diﬀerent isotopes of barium (left panel),
radium (right panel) for the parameter sets used in our
calculations. It is seen that the Nl3 parameter gives a
higher Qnuc
W compared to other parameters for radium
isotopes.

We next discuss explicitly the correction to the weak
charge arising from the diﬀerence between the neutron

these atoms have been suggested for possible measure-
ments of PNC. Our RMF calculation yields ∆Qn−p

of 0.35% for 134Ba and 1% for 226Ra. These results will
have an important bearing on high precision studies of
PNC in a single isotope or a chain of isotopes of Ba+ and
Ra+.

We have developed a matter wave interferometer based on the diﬀraction of atoms from eﬀective
absorption gratings of light. In a setup with cold rubidium atoms in an atomic fountain the in-
terferometer has been used to carry out tests of the equivalence principle on an atomic basis. The
gravitational acceleration of the two isotopes 85Rb and 87Rb was compared, yielding a diﬀerence
∆g/g = (1.2 ± 1.7) · 10−7. We also perform a diﬀerential free fall measurement of atoms in two
diﬀerent hyperﬁne states, and obtained a result of ∆g/g = (0.4 ± 1.2) · 10−7.

Optical ﬁelds can be used to coherently split and re-
combine atomic de Broglie waves [1]. To date, atomic
interferometry has allowed for impressive precision mea-
surements of the earth’s gravitation [2]. Einsteins weak

their internal composition, are aﬀected by gravity in an

universal way, i. e.
with the same acceleration. For macroscopic (i.e. classi-
cal) objects, tests of the equivalence principle have been
performed since the early days of modern physics [3].
Investigations of the equivalence principle on an atomic
basis have been proposed [4], motivated by the quest to
provide new tests of theories which merge quantum me-
chanics and relativity.

Here we report of an experiment demonstrating a test
of the equivalence principle with quantum probe par-
ticles based on atom interferometry. Our experiment
uses the two stable isotopes of the rubidium atom with
nearby optical transition wavelength. For our measure-
ments, we have developed a light pulse atom interfer-
ometer based on the diﬀraction of atoms from standing
optical waves acting as eﬀective absorption gratings. By
comparing the free fall of the two distinct isotopes 85Rb
and 87Rb, we have measured their diﬀerential accelera-
tion in the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld to a relative accu-
racy of 1.7·10−7. Further, we have tested for a variation
of the measured free fall acceleration as a function of
relative orientation of nuclear to electron spin to a dif-
ferential accuracy of 1.2·10−7 by comparing interference
patterns measured with 85Rb atoms prepared in two dif-
ferent hyperﬁne ground states. Within the quoted un-
certainties, the results in both of our measurements are
consistent with an isotope and internal state independent
gravitational acceleration. We expect that technical im-
provements will in future allow for very critical tests of
the equivalence principle on an atomic basis.

shift. For a comparison of diﬀerent tests of the equiva-
lence principle see [5]. To date, this tiny shift (of order
∆hg/c2) has been veriﬁed to an accuracy of 10−4 [6]. We
also wish to point out that theoretical work has discussed
the possibility of a spin-gravitational coupling [7]. Such
theories have so far only been tested with macroscopic
matter [8].

When comparing the free fall of diﬀerent atomic
species or atoms in diﬀerent internal states, it seems ad-
vantageous to use techniques which are only weakly de-
pendent on a speciﬁc internal atomic structure. In the to
date most absolute atomic interferometric measurement
of gravitation [2], beamsplitters based on oﬀ-resonant Ra-
man transitions were used which change both the internal
and external degrees of freedom. Another class of atom
interferometers only involve interference of the external
degrees of freedom, as have e.g. been realized with oﬀ-
resonant standing waves acting as phase gratings [9].

Our scheme for atomic interferometry is shown in Fig.
1. The atomic beam splitters are realized with pulsed
standing waves tuned resonantly to an open transition
from a ground state |gDi to a spontaneously decaying
excited state |ei. After the pulses only atoms in state
|gDi are detected. For an incident atom distribution,
the standing wave ﬁelds will lead to a spatially depen-
dent pumping, and atoms passing near the antinodes will
preferentially be ”removed” into states |gN D,ii, which are
not detected, while atoms near the nodes will remain in
state |gDi. The transient standing wave thus acts as an
eﬀective absorption grating of spatial periodicity λ/2, on
which an incident plane atom wave |gD, ~pi with internal
state |gDi and momentum ~p is diﬀracted into a series of
components ..., |gD, ~p − 2~~ki, |gD, ~pi, |gD, ~p + 2~~ki, ... .
For an increased pulse energy, the open fraction of the
eﬀective grating lessens, which results in a larger number
of generated paths.

Before proceeding, we note that the ﬁrst atom based
tests of general relativity are the famous Pound-Rebka
experiments, which are sensitive to the gravitational red-

Since only resonant light is used, we do not expect
phase shifts between adjacent paths due to the ac Stark
eﬀect. While diﬀraction from a single eﬀective optical ab-

sorption grating has been demonstrated [10], the exten-
sion to an atomic interferometer is not obvious since the
spontaneous emission occurring during the beam split-
ting process may a priori aﬀect the coherence, which
would destroy the observed interference contrast. The
operation of our atom interferometer demonstrates that
this is not the case, which intuitively can be seen by not-
ing that the use of an open optical transition ensures
that, assuming a favourable branching ratio, which-path
information is only present for atoms that have under-
gone an optical pumping event. Our experiment relies
on a rubidium atomic fountain, in which a temporal se-
quence of three resonant optical standing wave pulses is
applied to coherently split and redirect the wavepackets,
and ﬁnally readout the atomic interference pattern. The
diameter of the pulsed optical beams is suﬃciently large
that each pulse aﬀects the whole atomic cloud.

In our experiment, the ground state |gDi was chosen
to be a magnetic ﬁeld insensitive (mF = 0) Zeeman sub-
level of a rubidium ground state hyperﬁne component
(i.e. F=2 or F=3 for 85Rb, or F=1 for 87Rb). The stand-
ing wave is σ+−polarized and tuned resonantly to a hy-
perﬁne components of the rubidium D1-line. An atom
interferometer is realized with a sequence of three such
optical pulses. The ﬁrst standing wave pulse at t=0 splits
an atomic wavepacket into several distinct paths. At a
time t=T second pulse is applied, which again leads to
a diﬀraction and coherently splits up the paths. At time
t=2T, several paths spatially overlap in a series of fam-
ilies of wavepackets. We expect, that the wave nature
leads to a spatial atomic interference structure. To read
out this periodic fringe pattern, we again apply a res-
onant optical pulse tuned to the open transition. The
periodic pattern could now be read out by scanning the
position of this third grating and monitoring the number
of transmitted atoms in state |gDi. For technical reasons,
we actually leave the position of the optical grating con-
stant and instead vary the pulse spacing T, which due
to the earth’s gravitational acceleration also allows us to
observe the fringe pattern.

We shall now outline the calculation of the interfer-
ence pattern. The Hamiltonian of the system is assumed
to be H = ~p2/2m + (~ωeg − i~Γ/2)|eihe| − e~r · ~E where
~ωge denotes the atomic energy spacing between level
|gDi and |ei. The relaxation of the excited state is ac-
counted for by introducing a non-Hermitian decay term
- i~Γ
2 . This neglects the decay into the levels |gDi. In the
case of negligible branching ratio of the decay into |gDi
the above Hamiltonian would allow for an exact descrip-
tion of the observed fringe pattern. Otherwise, we ex-
pect an additional incoherent background to the fringes.
The standing wave electric ﬁeld is assumed to be ~E =
~E0 cos(~k~r − ωt) + ~E0 cos(−~k~r − ωt).

We shall ﬁrst consider the atomic response to a sin-
gle pulse of the standing wave ﬁeld. Assume that the
pulse length τ is so short that we can neglect the phase
evolution due to the kinetic energy term (Raman-Nath
regime [1]). A plane atomic wave with initial internal and
external states |gDi is then diﬀracted into the coherent
superposition of paths

where Ω = e ~E0hg|~r|ei~ denotes the Rabi frequency and
In(x) the modiﬁed Bessel function. Unlike the ”usual”
Bessel functions Jn(x) , which describe diﬀraction by an
oﬀ-resonant standing wave, the functions In(x) do not
oscillate with x. Because of this property optical ab-
sorption gratings are promising tools for future multiple
beam atom interferometers with large number of paths
[11, 12]. The approximate atom loss equals the ”open
ratio” of the eﬀective absorption grating, and is of order
1/N for an N-path beam splitter.

Using the above Hamiltonian one can calculate the mo-
mentum picture wavefunction directly before the third
(readout) pulse. We are interested in the atomic re-
sponse for a broad velocity distribution, for which the
velocity width along ~k is large compared to 1/(k·T ). In

While the expected density modulation is near sinusoidal

sharpens to a Airy-function like multiple-beam pattern
for larger pulse energies [13].

FIG. 2: Typical interference signals as a function of pulse
spacing T varied in narrow regions near T=40 ms. The signals
were recorded for (a) 85Rb atoms with the optical ﬁeld tuned
to the F=2→F’=3 component and for (b) 87Rb atoms using
F=1→F’=2 component of the rubidium D1-line respectively.
In the presence of the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld an observation
of the interference pattern is possible by a variation of the
interrogation times. Each data point corresponds to the signal
recorded in a single fountain launch. The solid lines are ﬁts
to sinusoidal functions.

Our experimental setup is based on a ultrahigh vacuum
chamber, in which 2 · 109 atoms (85Rb or 87Rb respec-
tively) are initially captured in a magnetooptical trap
and accelerated by an upwards traveling optical molasses.
The temperature of the atoms at this point is 6 µK. Af-
ter the launch, a homogeneous 50 mG magnetic bias ﬁeld
oriented parallel to the optical interferometer beams is
activated. While the atoms travels on a fountain-type
ballistic trajectory, a series of beam splitting pulses is
applied from the optical interferometer beams. Before
and after the interferometric pulses we select the mF = 0
component of the corresponding hyperﬁne state by an ap-
propriate sequence of microwave π-pulses and a resonant
optical pulse removing residual population. The atomic
signal is then measured with a FM-ﬂuorescence detection
method, for which the atoms were irradiated with a res-
onant modulated optical beam. The cold atoms convert
the frequency modulation into an amplitude modulated
ﬂuorescence, which is phase-sensitively detected. This
method was developed to selectively detect the signal of
cold atoms in the presence of a thermal rubidium back-
ground vapour. Further improvements on the signal to
noise ratio would be possible with a diﬀerentially pumped
vacuum chamber.

The optical interferometer pulse sequence is generated
by an injection locked master-slave diode laser system
operating near 795 nm and a passage through two acous-
tooptic modulators. The light is coupled into a single
mode optical ﬁber, expanded to a 3 cm Gaussian beam
diameter and coupled into the vacuum chamber. After
the transmitting the chamber, the beam is retroreﬂected
with a mirror. The generated (pulsed) optical stand-
ing wave irradiating the cold atoms is oriented vertically,
and has an intensity of 3 mW/cm2 per direction. The
retroreﬂection mirror is passively vibration isolated by
suspending the mirror on a 2.5 m long ribbon string.

FIG. 3: Total atom phase between adjacent paths of the 85Rb
interferometer as a function of interrogation time T. The solid
line represents a parabolic ﬁt. The used atomic levels were as
in Fig. 2a.

The atom interferometer as shown in Fig. 1 is realized
applying a temporal sequence of three resonant standing
wave pulses to the cold atoms. The length of an opti-
cal beam splitting pulse is 200 ns. We observe fringe
patterns with good signal to noise up to interrogation
times near T=40 ms. Fig. 2 shows typical atomic sig-
nals as a function of pulse spacing T between the optical
beam splitting pulses. The observed fringe contrast is 20
per cent for small interrogation times T and reduces to
some 9 per cent for the shown fringe patterns with high
gravitational sensitivity recorded near T=40 ms. This
loss of fringe contrast for longer coherence times is at-
tributed to residual mechanical vibrations of the interfer-
ometer beams retroreﬂecting mirror. The widths of the
observed principal maxima is between 0.4·2π and 0.5·2π.
The former value was reached when using longer optical
pulse lengths, which however lessened the signal ampli-
tude. We attribute this mainly to residual reﬂection of
the optical vacuum windows, which cause an intensity
imbalance between forward and backward running wave
of some 2 per cent. The imperfect window transmission
of our present apparatus is attributed to contamination
with adsorbed rubidium from the background vapour.
Applying a white light desorption method [14] lowers the
disturbing reﬂection from 6 to the above quoted value
of 2 per cent. We were however not able to completely
It is anticipated, that the
remove the contamination.
residual intensity imbalance also reduces the fringe con-
trast from an theoretical value near 100 per cent for the
used transition to the experimentally observed value at
small drift times T.

To determine the total phase shift between the inter-
fering paths induced by the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, we
have analyzed fringe patterns recorded for diﬀerent pulse
spacings T, which avoids any phase ambiguity caused by
the periodic character of the pattern. Figure 3 shows typ-
ical recorded data (dots) along with a ﬁt to the expected
parabolic curve (solid), while the gravitational acceler-
ation g was left as a free parameter. From the fringe
patterns recorded at T = 40 ms interrogation time, we
at present can determine the earth’s gravitational accel-
eration to a statistical accuracy of 8·10−8 in 6 hours of
data acquisition. It is anticipated that the implementa-

tion of an active vibration isolation stage, as used in ref.
[2], would allow for longer interrogation times and yield a
comparable statistical accuracy for measurements of the
gravitational phase.

2. Fig.

We have compared the gravitational acceleration ex-
perienced by 85Rb atoms in the F = 2, mF = 0 hy-
perﬁne ground state with that of 87Rb atoms in F =
1, mF = 0. For this atom based test of the equiva-
lence principle, we recorded series of fringe patterns with
T≃ 40 ms for the two diﬀerent isotopes. The data were
recorded in three measurement sessions, each correspond-
ing to the data recorded during one day. Fringe pat-
terns have for both measurements already been shown
in Fig.
4a shows the measured averaged
values of (g85Rb − g87Rb)/g85Rb in the three measure-
ment sessions along with a vertical
line representing
the total average. This ﬁnal value for the diﬀerence is
(g85Rb − g87Rb)/g85Rb = (1.2 ± 1.7) · 10−7. The quoted
statistical error here equals the (estimated) total uncer-
tainty. In our diﬀerential measurement, systematic errors
due to misalignment of the beams, wave front curvature,
and Coriolis forces largely cancel, and at the present level
of accuracy clearly can be neglected. Moreover, as all
paths of our atom interferometer are in the same internal
state, systematic eﬀects due to the second order Zeeman
shift only occur in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient. The estimated systematic uncertainty due to ﬁeld
inhomogenities (8 mG/cm) is for our present apparatus
estimated to be 5 · 10−11, which is also clearly negligi-
ble. Within the quoted uncertainties, our above given
value agrees well with the expected result of an identical
gravitational acceleration of the two rubidium isotopes.
We have furthermore compared the gravitational ac-
celeration experienced by atoms (85Rb) in the two dif-
ferent hyperﬁne ground states F = 2, mF = 0 and
F = 3, mF = 0. For the latter measurement, the opti-
cal interferometer beams were tuned to the F=3→F’=3
hyperﬁne component of the D1 line. Our experimental
results for the measured relative diﬀerential gravitational
acceleration is summarized in Fig. 4b. Our averaged, ﬁ-
nal result here is (gF =3 −gF =2)/gF =2 = (0.4±1.2)·10−7.
Within the quoted uncertainty, we do not observe a dif-
ference in the earth’s gravitational acceleration for atoms
in the two hyperﬁne states. Our atom interferometer in a
very natural way allows for a comparison of results that
are based on diﬀerent atomic states. An important ques-
tion for future theoretical work is to investigate to what
extend such a measurement of gravitational acceleration
of atoms in two diﬀerent internal states is complimentary
to atomic clock experiments of the Pound-Rebka type.

To conclude, we have demonstrated an atom interfer-
ometer based on pulsed, eﬀective absorption gratings of
light. We have applied the interferometer to demonstrate
novel atom based test of the equivalence principle.

For the future, improvements in wavefront quality and
a better vibrational isolation can yield longer coherence

ence signals with sharp principal maxima where in con-
trast to earlier schemes the path number is not limited
by the internal atomic structure [11, 12]. Furthermore,
we anticipate that atom interferometry will allow for very
critical test of the equivalence principle on an atomic ba-
sis.

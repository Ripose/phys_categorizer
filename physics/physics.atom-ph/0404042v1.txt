We perform accurate calculations of the dependence of transition frequencies in two valence elec-
tron atoms and ions on a variation of the ﬁne structure constant, α = e2/¯hc. The relativistic
Hartree-Fock method is used with many-body perturbation theory and conﬁguration interaction
methods to calculate transition frequencies. The results are to be used in atomic-clock-type labora-
tory experiments designed to test whether α varies in time.

INTRODUCTION

Theories unifying gravity with other interactions allow
for the possible variation of physical constants (see, e.g.
[1, 2, 3]). Recent analysis of quasar absorption spectra
suggests that the ﬁne structure constant α might vary
in space-time [4, 5, 6]. There is an intensive search for
alternative ways to test whether α is varying. One of
the very promising methods to study local present-day
variation of fundamental constants in time involves the
use of atomic clocks. In particular, optical atomic clock
transitions are suitable to study the possible variation
of the ﬁne structure constant. This is because the ratio
of the frequencies of the optical transitions depend on α
alone, while the frequencies of the hyperﬁne transitions
also depend on the nuclear magnetic moments and the
electron-proton mass ratio.

Laboratory measurements involve measuring how the
diﬀerence between two frequencies changes with time. To
relate a measurement of the change between two frequen-
cies to a change in α, the relativistic energy shifts are
needed. The relativistic energy shift describes how a level
moves as α varies. Two transition frequencies with very
diﬀerent relativistic energy shifts are the most desirable
candidates for precision experiments as they will have the
largest relative frequency shift between them.

The best limit on local present day variation of the
ﬁne structure constant published to date was obtained by
comparing cesium and rubidium atomic fountain clocks
[7]. Experiments have also been carried out compar-
ing cesium and magnesium [8] and a H-maser compared
with a Hg II clock [9]. There are many proposals for
the search of variation of α in atomic optical transitions,
some of which were analyzed previously in [10, 11, 12].
In the present work we perform relativistic many-body
calculations to ﬁnd the relativistic energy shift for many
two valence electron atoms and ions. Two valence elec-
tron atoms and ions were chosen since many new optical

clocks experiments, some of which are currently under
construction and some still under consideration, utilize
these atoms and ions (e.g.. Al II [13], Ca I [14], Sr I
[15, 16, 17], In II [18, 19, 20], Yb I, Hg I [21, 22]).

II. THEORY

In the present work we perform calculations for closed
shell atoms and ions which can also be considered
as atoms/ions with two valence electrons above closed
shells. We start our calculations from the relativistic
Hartree-Fock (RHF) (also known as Dirac-Hartree-Fock)
method in the V N approximation. This means that RHF
calculations are done for the ground state of the corre-
sponding atom/ion with all electrons included in the self-
consistent ﬁeld. The use of the V N RHF approximation
ensures good convergence of the consequent conﬁgura-
tion interaction (CI) calculations for the ground state.
Good accuracy for excited states is achieved by using a
large set of single-electron states. Note that there is an
alternative approach which uses the V N −2 starting ap-
proximation (with two valence electrons removed from
the RHF calculations). This approach has some advan-
tages, it is simpler, and ground and excited states are
treated equally. However, the convergence with respect
to the size of the basis is not as good and the ﬁnal results
are better in the V N approximation. We use the V N −2
approximation as a test of the accuracy of calculations of
the relativistic energy shifts, while presenting all results
in the V N approximation.

We use a form of the single-electron wave function that

explicitly includes a dependence on α:

ψ(r)njlm =

1
r (cid:16)

f (r)nΩ(r/r)jlm
iαg(r)n ˜Ω(r/r)jlm (cid:17).

(1)

This leads to the following form of the RHF equations
(in atomic units):

′

f

n(r) +

fn(r) − [2 + α2(ǫn − ˆVHF )]gn(r) = 0,

gn(r) + (ǫn − ˆVHF )fn(r) = 0,

(2)

κn
r
n(r) +

g

′

r

where κ = (−1)l+j+1/2(j + 1/2), n is the principle quan-
tum number and ˆVHF is the Hartree-Fock potential. The
non-relativistic limit corresponds to setting α = 0.

We then use the combination of the conﬁguration in-
teraction (CI) method with the many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT)[23, 24].
Interactions between valence
electrons are treated using the CI method while correla-
tions between the valence electrons and the core electrons
are included by means of the MBPT. We can write the
eﬀective CI Hamiltonian for two valence electrons as:

ˆH CI = ˆh1 + ˆh2 + ˆh12

(3)

here ˆhi (i = 1 or 2) is an eﬀective single-electron Hamil-
tonian given by

ˆhi = cα × p + (β − 1)mc2 −

+ ˆVcore + ˆΣ1,

(4)

Ze2
ri

ˆVcore is the Hartree-Fock potential created by the core
electrons, it diﬀers from ˆVHF in Eq. (2) by the contribu-
tion of the valence electrons. ˆΣ1 is the one-electron op-
erator that describes the correlation interaction between
a valence electron and the core. The third term in Eq.
(3) describes the interaction of the valence electrons with
each other and can be written as

ˆh12 =

+ ˆΣ2

e2
r12

(5)

where ˆΣ2 is a two-particle operator that describes the ef-
fects of screening of the Coulomb interaction between the
valence electrons by the core electrons. The operators ˆΣ1
and ˆΣ2 are calculated using the second order of MBPT.
We use the same set of single-electron basis states to
construct two-electron wave functions for the CI calcula-
tions and to calculate ˆΣ. The set is based on the B-spline
technique developed by Johnson et al [25, 26, 27]. We
use 40 B-splines in a cavity of radius R = 40aB (aB is
Bohr radius). The single-electron basis functions are lin-
ear combinations of 40 B-splines and are also eigenstates
of the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian (in the V N potential).
Therefore, we have 40 basis functions in each partial wave
including the B-spline approximations to the atomic core
states. We use a diﬀerent number of basis states for the
CI wave functions and for the calculations of ˆΣ. Satura-
tion comes much faster for the CI calculations. In these
calculations we use 14 states above the core in each par-
tial wave up to lmax = 3. Inclusion of states of higher
principal quantum number or angular momentum does
not change the result. To calculate ˆΣ we use 30 out of
40 states in each partial wave up to lmax = 4.

The results for the energies are presented in Table I.
We present the energies of the nsnp conﬁguration of two
electron atoms/ions with respect to their ground state
1S0 ns2. The states considered for atomic clock experi-
ments are 3P0 and 3P1. However, we present the result
for other states as well for completeness, these also make
it easier to analyze the accuracy of the calculations. Also,

transitions associated with some of these states are ob-
served in quasar absorption spectra (e.g., the 1S0 −1 P1
transition in Ca).

To demonstrate the importance of the core-valence cor-
relations we include results of pure CI calculations (with
no ˆΣ) as well as the results in which only ˆΣ1 is included
but ˆΣ2 is not. One can see that the accuracy of pure CI
calculations is about 10% while inclusion of core-valence
correlations improves it signiﬁcantly to the level of about
1%. The deviation from experiment of the ﬁnal theoreti-
cal energies for the triplet states of all atoms except Yb is
not more than 1%. For Yb it is 2%. The accuracy of the
singlet states is about 1% for the ions, 3-4% for CaI, SrI
and HgI and 6% for YbI. The accuracy of the ﬁne struc-
ture intervals ranges from 2 to 7%. The accuracy of cal-
culations for Yb is not as good as for other atoms because
the two electron approximation is a poor approximation
for this atom. Electrons from the 4f subshell, which are
kept frozen in present calculations, are relatively easy to
excite and corresponding conﬁgurations give substantial
contribution to the energy. Note that we do include these
excitations perturbatively, into the ˆΣ operator. However,
due to their large contribution, second-order treatment

of the excitations from the 4f subshell is not very accu-
rate. On the other hand, the CI+MBPT results for Yb
are still much better than pure CI values.

Note also that the CI+MBPT results presented in Ta-
ble I are in good agreement with similar calculations in
Refs. [28, 29].

values of x need to be calculated. The relativistic energy
shift q is then calculated using the formulae

q =

ω(∆x) − ω(−∆x)

and

In the vicinity of the α0, the present day value of α,

the frequency of a transition, ω, can be written as:

ω = ω0 + qx,

(6)

α0 )2 − 1, ω0 is the present day experimental
where x = ( α
value of the frequency and the q coeﬃcient is the rela-
tivistic energy shift that determines the frequency depen-
dence on α. It is clear from the above expression that q
coeﬃcients can be described by

q =

|x=0.

dω
dx

Thus, in order to calculate q coeﬃcients the atomic en-
ergy levels of the atoms and ions of interest at diﬀerent

q =

16(ω(∆x) − ω(−∆x)) − 2(ω(2∆x) − ω(−2∆x))
24∆x

.

(8)
The second formula is needed to check for non-linear con-
tributions to dω/dx. We use ∆x = 0.1 and ∆x = 0.125.
The results are presented in Table II.

As for the energies, we use three diﬀerent approxima-
tions to calculate relativistic energy shifts: (1) pure CI
approximation for two valence electrons, (2) CI with ˆΣ1
and (3) CI+MBPT approximation with both ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2
included.
Inclusion of core-valence correlations lead to
increased values of the q-coeﬃcients. This is because
the correlation interaction of a valence electron with the
core introduces an additional attraction which increase
the density of the valence electron in the vicinity of the
nucleus and thus emphasize the importance of the rela-
tivistic eﬀects.

Note that ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 are of the same order and need
to be included simultaneously to obtain reliable results.
ˆΣ1 is much easier to calculate and inclusion of ˆΣ1 alone
often leads to signiﬁcant improvements of the results for
the energies (see Table I). However, the results for the
q-coeﬃcients show that neglecting ˆΣ2 may lead to sig-
niﬁcant loss in accuracy. Indeed, the results for q’s with
ˆΣ1 alone are often smaller than those obtained in pure
CI and CI+MBPT approximations and diﬀer from ﬁnal
values by up to 50%. Since neglecting ˆΣ2 cannot be jus-
tiﬁed, we present results without ˆΣ2 for illustration pur-
pose only.

The accuracy of the calculation of the q-coeﬃcients can
be estimated by comparing the CI and CI+MBPT results
calculated in the V N and V N −2 approximations and also
by comparing the ﬁnal results for the energies (including
ﬁne structure intervals) with experimental values. As
one can see from Table II inclusion of the core-valence
correlations can change the values of the q-coeﬃcients
by more than 15%. However, the accuracy of the ener-
gies improves signiﬁcantly when core-valence correlations
are included. It is natural to expect that the ﬁnal accu-

4

racy for the q-coeﬃcients is also higher when core-valence
correlations are included. Comparison with our previ-
ous results also shows some deviation on approximately
the same level (the largest relative discrepancy is for Ca
where relativistic eﬀects are small and high accuracy is
not needed). Most of this discrepancy can be attributed
to the inaccuracy of our old, less complete calculations.
Comparison between the energies calculated in the V N
and V N −2 approximations and the experimental values
suggest that 10% is a reasonable estimate of the accuracy
of the present calculations of the relativistic energy shifts
for Al II, Ca I and Sr I, 15% for In II, 25% for Yb I and
20% for Hg I and Tl II.

In Table III we present ﬁnal values of the relativistic

energy shifts together with the experimental energies.

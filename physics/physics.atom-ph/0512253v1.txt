The measurements of the metrological characteristics (amplitude, width, and shift in the magnetic ﬁeld)
[quant-ph/0506167] as the reference
of the dark pseudoresonance, which was proposed by Kazakov et al.
resonance for an atomic frequency standard, are reported. It has been shown that the characteristics of the
pseudoresonance are worse than those of the unsplit electromagnetically induced transparency resonance for
the excitation scheme with the lin||lin polarization on the D1 line of the 87Rb atom.

Since the 1970s, two-photon resonances free of
Doppler broadening have been successfully used as a
reference for quantum frequency standards [1, 2].
In
1993, the eﬀect of coherent population trapping was
proposed to be used to create a microwave frequency
standard based exclusively on optical elements without
a microwave cavity [3]. In recent years, the possibility of
creating an atomic clock based on this eﬀect is actively
analyzed [4, 5, 6, 7]. Two copropagating laser ﬁelds act-
ing on the allowed electric dipole transitions in the Λ-
conﬁguration create a long-lived superposition of states
in hyperﬁne sublevels of the ground states of the alkali-
metal atoms. When the diﬀerence between the frequen-
cies varies near the hyperﬁne splitting frequency ∆hf s
, the transmission resonance is observed (named as co-
herent population trapping resonance or Λ- resonance).
The resonance width in the limit of low intensities is de-
termined by the coherence lifetime in the ground state.
10−13 ( τ = 2000
To date, a frequency stability of 6.4
s) is reached in such a microwave standard [6]. More-
over, the possibility of a radical decrease in the volume
of quantum discriminators of the coherent population
trapping clock on Cs and Rb (to about 10 mm3 ) was
demonstrated [8, 9]. Investigations in this direction are
actively continued.

It is known that the stability of quantum frequency
standards increases with increasing the amplitude A of

where σ(τ ) is the Allan parameter, ∆hf s is the stan-

radiation that is not absorbed by the medium. For this
reason, the search for schemes for the excitation of the
coherent population trapping resonance with high con-
trast (>5%), minimum width, and light shift is of cur-
rent interest for an increase in the stability of the clock.
A pushpull pumping scheme that allows the pro-
duction of a pure coherent state was proposed in [9].
Atoms in such a state do not interact with the ﬁeld;

position of the wave functions of the Zeeman sublevels
of the ground state. In that work, a contrast of about
30% was experimentally achieved. The pure dark state
prepared by means of a standing wave was also demon-
strated in [10]. In [11], it is shown that, when the red de-
tuning of the frequency of the pump ﬁeld is equal to the
hyperﬁne splitting ∆hf s of the ground state, a contrast
of about 20% is reached with almost zero shifts. We note
that, although this work does not involve the coherent
population trapping eﬀect, it is close to the subject un-
der discussion in its aim: the use of the bichromatic
ﬁeld, and the Λ-conﬁguration of the involved processes.

the coherent population trapping resonance, the pulse
scheme of detecting the resonance was studied by the
Ramsey method [12]. A unique possibility was pointed
out in [13] for forming the pure coherent population
trapping resonance (free of trap states) due to the in-
teraction between the bichromatic ﬁeld with lin
lin po-
larized components and the 5P1/2 state of 87Rb atoms.
In that case, a pure dark state appeared under the ac-
tion of the linearly polarized bichromatic ﬁeld under
the condition of the spectral resolution of the hyperﬁne
structure of the excited state (Fig.1). The achievement
of a contrast of about 50% was reported in that work.
It was pointed out that the magnetic ﬁeld sensitiv-
ity (quadratic Zeeman shift) of the proposed resonance
should be 1/1.33 of the shift of the resonance formed
due to excitation by the circularly polarized bichromatic
ﬁeld (σ+-σ+ scheme). In that work, it was also noted
that the resonance was split into two resonances in high

magnetic ﬁelds. This splitting arises because the g fac-
tors of two hyperﬁne sublevels of the ground state are
slightly diﬀerent due to the nuclear-spin contribution.

In [14], it was proposed to use a dip arising due
to a splitting of the resonance as the reference for the
microwave standard (see Fig.1). The authors of [14]
referred to the dip as pseudoresonance, because it ap-
peared due to the splitting of the coherent population
trapping resonance in the magnetic ﬁeld. The estimates
made in that work showed the possibility of reaching a
frequency stability of 10−14/√τ . Such a high stability
would enable one to consider the pseudoresonance as
a high-priority and promising tool for creating atomic
frequency standards based on the coherent population
trapping eﬀect. For this reason, theoretical and experi-
mental investigation of the pseudoresonance, as well as
comparison with the unsplit coherent population trap-
ping resonance, seems to be of interest.

In this paper, the experimental results on certain
metrological characteristics of the pseudoresonance are
reported. It is shown that they are worse than those of
the initial (unsplit) coherent population trapping reso-
nance.

Figure 2 shows the layout of the experimental setup
that consists of a laser system, a cell ﬁlled with 87Rb va-
por, and a detection system. The experiment was con-
ducted with a Pyrex cylindrical cell (40 mm in length
and 25 mm in diameter) containing Ne at a pressure of
4 Torr and isotopically pure 87Rb. The cell was placed
inside a solenoid, which provided variation in the lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. To screen the external labo-
ratory ﬁeld, the cell was placed inside three cylindrical
magnetic screens. The heating of the cell was performed
by means of a biﬁlar nichrome wire coiled around the
inner magnetic screen. The cell temperature was equal

to 500C. The bichromatic resonance ﬁeld was produced
by modulating the current of a “slave” laser whose fre-
quency was matched by the frequency of a single-mode
external-cavity injection laser (ECLD, “master”). To
this end, the radiation of the latter laser was injected
through a isolator into the active region of the driven
laser (DL). In this case, the modulation did not disturb
the regime of the maser laser (ECLD). The injection
current of the driven laser (DL) was modulated at a fre-
quency of ∆hf s/2 = 3.417 GHz by means of an Agilent
E8257D-502 microwave generator, which was connected
to the “slave” laser through a Minicircuits ZFBT-6G T
bias. Such a procedure ensured the generation of res-
onant optical ﬁelds with a high correlation degree of
phase noises. The ratio of the intensities of these ﬁelds
could be changed by slightly varying the current of the
driven laser. The resonant ﬁelds carried approximately
50% of the total power of the radiation (2 mW). The
ratio of the intensities of the resonant ﬁelds was equal
to 1.4, and the amplitude of the coherent population
trapping resonance was maximal. The remaining power
was contained in the carrier and higher order side fre-
quencies. The laser beam in the cell had a diameter
of 4 mm. The coherent population trapping resonance
was excited by the linearly polarized ﬁrst-order compo-
nents, which were tuned to the Fg = 1
Fe = 1 and
Fe = 1 transitions. The intensity of the radi-
Fg = 2
ation passed through the cell was measured by a photo-
diode. In order to study the pseudoresonance, the mod-
ulation frequency ∆hf s/2 was linearly scanned in a nar-
150kHz) for various magnetic ﬁelds. The
row range (
amplitude and width (Fig.3) of the resonance, as well
as its amplitude-to-width ratio and its position (Fig.4),
were studied as functions of the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld, the amplitude
of the coherent population trapping resonance is one
order of magnitude less than the amplitudes of the res-
onances observed in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld.
In the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld, this resonance is
split into three resonances: the magnetically indepen-
dent central resonance at the transition frequency ∆hf s
and two magnetically dependent resonances. The cen-
tral resonance is formed by two Λ transitions:

reaches 40%. The amplitude of the magnetically depen-
dent resonances also increases to 12%. The resonances
grow upon the appearance of the magnetic ﬁeld, be-
cause the removal of degeneration destroys dark trap
states on the Zeeman sublevels that belong to the same
hyperﬁne level and on which atoms are hidden. To de-
stroy these traps, a magnetic ﬁeld whose magnitude is
higher than the width of the resonance is necessary. In
not too strong ﬁelds, the width of the resonance is de-
termined by the optical pumping rate for the ground
state [15]. A further increase in the magnetic ﬁeld (to
0.5 G, see Fig.5) results in a new splitting of the central
resonance. In this way, the pseudoresonance appears.
The amplitude of the pseudoresonance is saturated at
a magnetic ﬁeld exceeding 7.0 G but does not reach
the amplitude of the initial coherent population trap-
ping resonance, see Fig.3(upper panel). The width of

the pseudoresonance becomes less than the width of the
initial resonance at a magnetic ﬁeld of less than 4.0 G,
for which the amplitude of the pseudoresonance is very
small.

It is seen in Fig.4 that the maximum A/W ratio
is reached at a magnetic ﬁeld of about 3.4G. For this
ﬁeld both the width and amplitude of the pseudoreso-
nance are less than the respective values of the initial
resonance. The ratio A/W for the pseudoresonance is
worse at any magnetic ﬁeld. It is worth noting that, for
locking of the quartz-oscillator frequency in the atomic
clock, resonances with a sharp peak (with a larger slope
of the ﬁrst derivative) are preferable over those with a
smooth peak, as in the case of the pseudoresonance.

We point to one more feature of the behavior of the
split resonance. Figure 5 shows the shift of two true
coherent population trapping resonances (lines a and
c) and the pseudoresonance (line b) as the longitudinal
ﬁeld varies. This dependence for the coherent popula-
tion trapping resonances has the form (see, e.g., [14])

where µB is the Bohr magneton, µN is the nuclear

Lande factors, respectively.
It is seen that the shift
of the coherent population trapping resonances are the
sum of the linear and quadratic contributions from both
transitions mF =

linear law. However, as the ﬁeld increases, the left res-
onance changes the direction of its shift and begins to
move in the same direction as the right resonance, be-
cause the quadratic term begins to dominate in Eq. (2).

is found with a coeﬃcient of about 0.43
As was predicted in [13], this coeﬃcient is less than the
corresponding coeﬃcient for the standard atomic clock
by a factor of 1.33 [16].

±

In this work, certain metrological characteristics of
the dark pseudoresonance have been experimentally
studied. The results provide the conclusion that these
characteristics are noticeably worse than the respective
characteristics of the initial (unsplit) coherent popu-
lation trapping resonance from which the pseudoreso-
nance appears. Thus, we think that the use of the pseu-
doresonance as the reference for the atomic clock is not
an optimum solution when using the lin
lin excitation
scheme on the D1 line of the 87Rb atom. At least more
detailed theoretical investigation is required for deter-
mining the experimental conditions (cell sizes, buﬀer gas
pressure, etc.) under which the pseudoresonance could
be preferable over the unsplit coherent population trap-
ping resonance

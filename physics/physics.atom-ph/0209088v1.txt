Abstract

The nuclear-polarization (NP) energies for hydrogenlike heavy ions are calcu-

lated using the same collective model employed in [1, 2]. The transverse, as well

as the Coulomb contributions, are considered in both the Feynman and Coulomb

gauges. A considerable gauge violation is found when the ladder and cross dia-

grams only are taken into account. A schematic nuclear model with a separable

interaction between nucleons gives the same transition densities of charge as those

of the collective model employed. Using this equivalence, NP energy shifts with

the collective model are gauge invariantly evaluated for the 1s1/2 states in 208
and 238

1 Introduction

High-precision Lamb-shift measurement on high-Z hydrogenlike atoms [3] spurred a re-

newed interest in the quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculation of electronic atoms.

Comparison of theoretical results with corresponding experimental data allows sensitive

tests of QED in strong electromagnetic ﬁelds [4, 5].

In this context, the study of the

nuclear-polarization (NP) eﬀect becomes important because the NP eﬀect, as a non-

QED eﬀect which depends on the model used to describe the nuclear dynamics, sets a

limit to any high-precision test of QED.

A relativistic ﬁeld-theoretical treatment of NP calculation was presented by Plunien

et al. [6, 7] utilizing the concept of eﬀective photon propagators with nuclear-polarization

insertions. In these studies, only the Coulomb interaction was considered based on the
argument that the relative magnitude of transverse interaction is of the order of (v/c)2

and the velocity v associated with nuclear dynamics is mainly nonrelativistic.

Using the same collective model used in [1, 6, 7] for nuclear excitations, the eﬀect of

the transverse nuclear polarization for heavy electronic atoms was studied in the Feynman

gauge by Yamanaka et al. [2]. They found that the transverse contribution is several times

larger than the Coulomb contribution in heavy electronic atoms before the contributions

of the positive and negative energy states cancel. However, due to the nearly complete

cancellation between them, the transverse eﬀects become small and the net eﬀect is
92U91+. As
destructive to the Coulomb contribution in both 1s1/2 states of 208
a result, the total NP energy almost vanishes in 208

82Pb81+ and 238

82Pb81+.
Recently, the NP eﬀects for hydrogenlike and muonic 208

82Pb81+ were calculated in both

the Feynman and Coulomb gauges, using a nonrelativistic random phase approximation

(RPA) to describe nuclear excitations [8, 9]. It was found that, in the hydrogenlike atom,

the NP eﬀects due to the ladder and cross diagrams have serious gauge dependence and

inclusion of the seagull diagram is indispensable to restore the gauge invariance [8]. In

contrast, the magnitude of the seagull collection is a few percent eﬀect in the muonic

atom, although it improves the gauge invariance [9].

In the present paper, we report that the nuclear collective model employed for hy-

drogenlike ions in [1, 2, 6, 7] also leads to a large violation of gauge invariance as far

as the ladder and cross diagrams only are considered. Then it is shown, based on the

equivalence of the transition density of the collective model and a microscopic nuclear

model with a schematic interaction between nucleons, that the seagull corrections should

2

also be calculated with the collective model in order to obtain gauge invariant NP results.
The resulting gauge invariant NP energy shifts are given for the 1s1/2 states in 208

The lowest vibrational modes are expected to have density variations with no radial

nodes, which may be referred to as shape oscillations. The corresponding charge density

The liquid drop model of Bohr (BM)[10] is a simple model of such a shape oscillation

obtained by considering deformation of the nuclear radius parameter while leaving the

surface diﬀuseness independent of angle:

There is in no way a unique prescription to describe the shape oscillation. If we assume

that under distortion, an element of mass moves from r0 to r without alteration of the

volume it occupies, i.e., the nucleus is composed of an inhomogeneous incompressible

This version will be hereafter referred to as the Tassie Model (TM) [11]. In Eqs.(4) and

(6), ̺0(r) is usually taken to be equal to the ground-state charge distribution.

In either case, the motion of nuclear matter is assumed to be incompressible and

irrotational, hence the velocity ﬁeld v(r) is given by a velocity potential of incompressible
and irrotational ﬂow as v(t, r) = ∇Φ(t, r). This implies the nuclear current deﬁned by

The surface oscillation usually applies to the case of the multipolarity L ≥ 2. However,

it should be mentioned that for L = 1, the transition densities given by (14) and (15) have

the same forms given by the Goldhaber-Teller model of giant dipole resonances describing

the relative motion of neutrons and protons [12]. For the monopole vibration, it is also

possible to construct corresponding charge and current densities [2, 6].

3 Transition densities to sum-rule saturated levels

The NP calculations with the collective model assume that a single giant resonance with

spin multipolarity L saturates the energy-weighted B(EL) strength for each isospin. In

this respect, let us ﬁrst recall the fact that the transition densities of charge to the sum-

rule saturated levels are given in terms of the ground-state charge density [13]. This

can be seen as follows. The energy-weighted sum rule can be generalized to a pair of

single-particle operators g(r) = g(r)YLM (Ω) and f (r) = f (r)YLM (Ω), and is given in a

form [14] :

where ̺0(r) is the charge distribution of the ground state normalized as

In general, the residual interaction is attractive for iso-scalar excitations and repulsive

respectively. When the particle-hole excitation energies are degenerate and equal to ǫ, it

is well known that a collective state |LMi with an excitation energy ∆EL exists, which

exhausts the energy-weighted transition strength of the single particle operator rLYLM :

∆EL |hLM|rLYLM |0i|2 = ǫ

|hm|rLYLM |ii|2.

(22)

For example, if the ground state is assumed to be a ﬁlled major shell of the harmonic

oscillator potential:

(17)

(18)

(20)

(21)

(23)

the particle-hole excitation energy ǫ is taken to be 1¯hω for 1− and 2¯hω for 0+ and 2+.

The corresponding collective states exhaust the energy-weighted sum rules, because the

transition strengths vanish outside these p-h excitation spaces. Therefore, the transition

densities of charge to the collective states of this ﬁctitious nucleus are given by (17).

When the ground-state charge density is approximated by a uniform charge density,

which is a reasonable approximation for a heavy nucleus, the transition density of charge

becomes identical with that of the collective model employed in NP calculations for

hydrogenlike atoms. However, the electromagnetic interaction of this model is simply

given by the minimal substitution pi → pi − eiA to the Hamiltonian H = HHO + VS.

Although JLL+1(r) current density appears in this model, JLL−1(r) dominates in the

transverse interaction of hydrogenlike ions. The NP calculation with this model requires

the seagull contribution in order to be gauge invariant.

It should be noted that the

seagull contribution is given in terms of the ground-state charge distribution and does

not depend on the details of the model for nuclear excitations.

These arguments indicate that the NP calculation with the collective model without

seagull diagrams also leads to a violation of the gauge invariance, and that the gauge

invariance of the collective model will be restored by including the seagull contribution.

In the next section, we show by numerical calculation that this is indeed the case.

4 Numerical results

The lowest-order contributions to NP are given by three Feynman diagrams in Fig. 1,

where two photons are exchanged between a bound electron and a nucleus. The nuclear

vertices are understood to have no diagonal matrix elements for the ladder and cross

diagrams, and no nuclear intermediate states for the seagull diagram. For the formulas

to calculate the NP energy shifts due to these diagrams, we refer to [8].

In the present NP calculations of the 1s1/2 states in hydrogenlike 208

82Pb and 238

92U,

the parameters of the collective model are the same as those given in Refs.

[1, 2]. The

same low-lying states and giant resonances are taken into account.

In addition, the

contributions from the 4− and 5− giant resonances are also calculated in order to see

the eﬀects of higher multipoles neglected previously. The B(EL) values are adjusted

to the observed values for low-lying states and the B(EL) are estimated through the

energy-weighted sum rule for giant resonances.

7

Tables I and II show the results for the 1s1/2 states in 208

82Pb81+ and 238

92U91+, where

the sum of the contributions from the three diagrams of Fig.1 is given for each multipole.

The second and the third columns are the results including the transverse eﬀects in

the Feynman and Coulomb gauges, respectively. The values in the parentheses are the

contributions from the seagull diagram. The NP energy shifts due to the ladder and

crossed diagrams only are obtained by subtraction of the seagull contributions given in

the parentheses. The fourth column gives the results of the present Coulomb nuclear

polarization (CNP). The last two columns are the results of the previous calculations.

The results with the collective model, as with the microscopic RPA model [8], also lead

to large violations of gauge invariance if ladder and crossed diagram contributions only

are considered. The seagull corrections are considerable in the 1− contributions for both
92U91+. Note that, in the limit of point nucleus, which is not unrealistic
of 208

82Pb81+ and 238

even for heavy hydrogenlike ions, the seagull collection occurs only in the dipole mode

which involves the J10(r) current.

In 208

82Pb81+, the contributions from low-lying states are about 10% of the total results

and the NP energy shift is mainly determined by the giant resonance contributions.

The most dominant contribution comes from the giant dipole resonance, where a large

violation of gauge invariance occurs if the seagull contributions in the parentheses are

neglected: −22 meV becomes +20 meV and −14 meV in Feynman and Coulomb gauges,

respectively. The column 5 gives the previous results in the Feynman gauge without

seagull contributions. The diﬀerences between the two results in the Feynman gauge

come from the accuracy of numerical integration over the continuum threshold region

of electron intermediate states and from the diﬀerences of the electron wave functions:

here we have used wave functions in a ﬁnite charge distribution, while [2] employs point

Coulomb solutions.

In 238

92U91+, the dominant contribution comes from the lowest excited states 2+ with

a large B(E2) value. Since the transition density of current in the present model given

by (15) is proportional to the excitation energy, the transverse contribution of the lowest
2+ is negligible due to its exceptionally small excitation energy ∆E2 = 44.9 keV. Apart

from this large Coulomb contribution, the contributions from the other states show similar

8

tendencies as in 208

82Pb81+. Namely, the contributions from other low-lying states are small

compared with the giant resonance contributions, and a large gauge violation occurs in

the giant dipole resonance when the seagull contribution is omitted.

5 Summary

Using the equivalence of the transition densities, the gauge invariant predictions of the

transverse eﬀects with the collective model are obtained by inclusion of the seagull con-
tribution. The gauge invariance is restored to a few percent levels in both 208
82Pb81+ and
92U91+ for each of the multipoles separately. Without the seagull correction, the Feyn-
238

man gauge in particular does not give reliable predictions of NP, although numerical

calculation in this gauge is easier than in the Coulomb gauge.
The NP energy shifts are −35.0(−35.4) meV in 208

82Pb81+ and −205(−203) meV in
92U91+ for Coulomb (Feynman) gauge. The net transverse eﬀect is about 14 ∼ 15%
238
82Pb81+. This is similar to the result
of the Coulomb energy shift of −30.7 meV in 208

of the microscopic model [8], and should be compared with the transverse eﬀect of the
1s1/2 state in muonic 208
82Pb, which is about 6 % of the Coulomb contribution [9]. The
92U91+ is reduced to about 6% of
percentage of the transverse eﬀect in the total shifts in 238
the Coulomb eﬀect due to the dominant Coulomb contribution from the lowest 2+ state.

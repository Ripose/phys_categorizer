(Dated: November 20, 2013)
Energies of (3s23p63d94l4l′), (3s23p53d104l4l′), and (3s3p63d104l4l′) states for Cu-like ions with
Z = 30 -100 are evaluated to second order in relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT)
starting from a Ni-like Dirac-Fock potential. Second-order Coulomb and Breit-Coulomb interactions
are included. Correction for the frequency-dependence of the Breit interaction is taken into account
in lowest order. The Lamb shift correction to energies is also included in lowest order. Intrinsic
particle-particle-hole contributions to energies are found to be 20-30% of the sum of one- and two-
body contributions. Transition rates and line strengths are calculated for the 3l − 4l′ electric-dipole
(E1) transitions in Cu-like ions with nuclear charge Z = 30 - 100. RMBPT including the Breit
interaction is used to evaluate retarded E1 matrix elements in length and velocity forms. First-order
RMBPT is used to obtain intermediate coupling coeﬃcients and second-order RMBPT is used to
calculate transition matrix elements. A detailed discussion of the various contributions to the dipole
matrix elements and energy levels is given for copperlike tungsten (Z = 74). The transition energies
used in the calculation of oscillator strengths and transition rates are from second-order RMBPT.
Trends of the transition rates as functions of Z are illustrated graphically for selected transitions.
Comparisons are made with available experimental data. These atomic data are important in
modeling of M-shell radiation spectra of heavy ions generated in electron beam ion trap experiments
and in M-shell diagnostics of plasmas.

INTRODUCTION

This work further develops the application of the rela-
tivistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) to the
studies of atomic characteristics of particle-particle-hole
excitations of closed-shell ions. Recently, RMBPT calcu-
lations of energies [1] and transition rates [2] in Na-like
ions have been performed. The present paper focuses on
the RMBPT calculations of energies and transition rates
in Cu-like ions. These transitions form satellite lines to
the brightest Ni-like ions and are of a great importance
for M-shell diagnostics of heavy ions.

The second-order RMBPT calculations for Cu-like ions
start from a 1s22s22p63s23p63d10 [Ni] Dirac-Fock poten-
tial. All possible 3l holes and 4l4l′ particles leading to
563 odd-parity and 571 even-parity 3l−14l′4l”(J) states
are considered. The energies of the 1134 states and tran-
sition probabilities of the 2294 electric-dipole lines are
calculated for Cu-like ions with Z = 30-100. Transi-
tions from the (3s23p63d94l4l′), (3s23p53d104l4l′), and
(3s3p63d104l4l′) states to the ground (3s23p63d104s) or
singly excited (3s23p63d104l) states (with l = p, d, f )
form satellite lines to the bright electric-dipole (E1) lines
in Ni-like ions. These core-excited states (or often called
doubly-excited states) in copperlike ions have been stud-
ied extensively both experimentally and theoretically in
the past 15-20 years.

Experimentally, these conﬁgurations have been stud-
ied by photon and electron emission spectroscopy. To

our knowledge, the ﬁrst measurements of 3d − 4p tran-
sitions in Cu-like W and Tm were done by Klapisch
et al. [3] by classiﬁcation of x-ray spectra from laser
produced plasmas in the range 6 - 9 ˚A. It was shown
that most of the Cu-like 3d − 4p line radiation came
from (3s23p63d104s − 3s23p63d94s4p), (3s23p63d104p −
3s23p63d94p2),
(3s23p63d104d − 3s23p63d94p4d), and
(3s23p63d104f − 3s23p63d94p4f ) transitions. Wave-
lengths and transition probabilities were calculated in [3]
by the relativistic parametric potential method [4]. The
same method was extended by Mandelbaum et al. [5]
to study x-ray spectra from laser produced plasmas of
atoms from Tm (Z = 69) up to Pt (Z = 78). An ex-
tended analysis of x-ray spectra of laser produced gold
plasmas has been performed by Busquet et al. [6] in-
cluding 3d − 4f , 3d − 4p, and 3p − 4s transitions in Ni-,
Co-, Cu-, Zn-, and Ga-like Au. The Ni-, Co-, Cu-, Zn-,
Ga-, Ge-, and As-like isoelectronic sequences have been
considered in Ref. [7] to investigate the x-ray spectra of
laser-irradiated elements from tantalum (Z = 73) to lead
(Z = 82). In addition to the above mentioned isoelec-
tronic sequences, the Fe- and Mn-like states have been
included by Zigler et al. [8] to analyze x-ray spectra em-
mited by laser-produced plasmas of lanthanum (Z = 57)
and praseodymium (Z = 59). The wavelengths and tran-
sition probabilities have been calculated in [6, 7, 8] by
the relativistic parametric potential method [4]. Inves-
tigation of the x-ray spectrum emitted by laser produced
barium plasmas has been recently described by Doron
et al. [9, 10]. The RELAC relativistic atomic code [4]

has been used to identify 3d − nl (n = 4 to 8), 3p − 4s,
and 3p − 4d transitions of Ni-like Ba28+ and correspond-
ing satellite transitions in neighboring ionization states:
Fe-, Co-, Cu-, Zn-, Ga-, and Ge-like ions. The X-ray
spectrum emitted by a laser produced cerium plasma in
the range 7.5 - 12 ˚A has been recently investigated in
detail by Doron et al. [11, 12]. The RELAC computer
code [4] has been used to study x-ray spectra from highly
charged tungsten ions in tokamak plasmas in the range
7 - 10 ˚A [13].

In the present paper, RMBPT is implemented to de-
termine energies of (3s23p63d94l4l′), (3s23p53d104l4l′),
and (3s3p63d104l4l′) states for Cu-like ions with nuclear
charges in the range of Z = 30 –100. The calculations are
carried out to second order in perturbation theory and in-
clude second-order Coulomb and Breit interactions. Cor-
rections for the frequency-dependent Breit interaction are
taken into account in the lowest order. Screened self-
energy and vacuum polarization data given by Kim et al.
[14] are used to determine the QED correction.

RMBPT is used to evaluate matrix elements,

line
strengths, and transition rates for 2294 allowed and for-
bidden electric-dipole transitions between the 1332 even-
parity core-excited states [Ni](3d−1 + 3s−1)(4s2 + 4s4d +
4p2 +4d2 +4p4f +4f 2) + [Ni](3p−1)(4s4p+4s4f +4p4d+
4d4f ), and the singly excited [Ni](4p + 4f ) states and the
962 odd-parity core-excited states [Ni](3p−1)(4s2+4s4d+
4p2 +4d2 +4p4f +4f 2) + [Ni](3d−1 +3s−1)(4s4p+4s4f +
4p4d + 4d4f ) and the ground state [Ni](4s) together with
the singly excited [Ni](4d) states in Cu-like ions with nu-
clear charges ranging from Z = 30 to 100. Retarded E1
matrix elements are evaluated in both length and veloc-
ity forms. These calculations start from a [Ni] Dirac-
Fock potential. First-order perturbation theory is used
to obtain intermediate coupling coeﬃcients and second-
order RMBPT is used to determine transition matrix el-
ements. The transition energies employed in the calcu-
lations of line strengths and transition rates are derived
from second-order RMBPT.

II. METHOD

Details of the RMBPT method were presented in
Ref. [1] for calculation of energies of particle-particle-hole
states and in Ref. [2] for calculation of radiative transi-
tion rates from particle-particle-hole state to one-particle
state. Diﬀerences between calculations for Na-like and
Cu-like ions are due to the increased size of the model
space (4l′4l′′3l−1 instead of 3l′3l′′2l−1) and diﬀerences
in the Dirac-Fock potential (1s22s22p63s23p63d10 instead
of 1s22s22p6), leading to 1134 states instead of 106 and
more laborious numerical calculations.

As a ﬁrst step, we determine and store the single-
particle contributions to the energies for ﬁve n=3 hole
states (3s, 3p1/2, 3p3/2, 3d3/2, and 3d5/2) and the
seven n=4 valence states (4s, 4p1/2, 4p3/2, 4d3/2,
4d5/2, 4f5/2, and 4f7/2) in lowest, ﬁrst, and second or-

2

ders. Next, we evaluate and store the 664 two-particle
h4l4l′J|H eﬀ |4l′′4l′′′Ji matrix elements and the 1127 hole-
particle h3l4l′ J|H eﬀ|3l′′4l′′′ Ji matrix elements of the ef-
fective Hamiltonian in ﬁrst and second orders. It should
be noted that these one-particle, two-particle, and hole-
particle matrix elements were used previously to evaluate
energies of the 4l4l′ levels in Zn-like ions [15] and energies
of the 3l−14l′ levels in Ni-like ions [16]. Finally, second-
order particle-particle-hole matrix elements are evaluated
[1]. Combining these data using the method described
below, we calculate one-, two-, and three-body contribu-
tions to the energies of Cu-like ions.

The calculations are carried out using sets of basis
Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) orbitals. The orbitals used
in the present calculation are obtained as linear combi-
nations of B-splines. These B-spline basis orbitals are de-
termined using the method described in Ref. [17]. Forty
B-splines of order of eight for each single-particle angu-
lar momentum state are used and all orbitals with orbital
angular momentum l ≤ 7 are included in the basis set.

A. Model space

The model space for core-excited 4l4l′3l−1 states of
copperlike ions includes 563 odd-parity states consisting
of 78 J=1/2 states, 131 J=3/2 states, 143 J=5/2 states,
125 J=7/2 states, and 86 J=9/2 states. Additionally,
there are 571 even-parity states consisting of 78 J=1/2
states, 131 J=3/2 states, 148 J=5/2 states, 125 J=7/2
states, and 89 J=9/2 states. The distribution of some
of the 1134 states in the model space is summarized in
Table I of the accompanying EPAPS document [18].

B. Energy-matrix elements

The evaluation of the second-order energies for the
4l4l′(J1)3l′′ (J) states in Cu-like ions follows the pat-
tern of the corresponding calculation for Zn-like and Ni-
In particular, we use
like ions given in Refs. [15, 16].
the second-order one- and two-particle matrix elements
for Zn-like ions calculated in [15] and hole-particle ma-
trix elements for Ni-like ions calculated in [16], but re-
coupled as described below, to obtain the one- and two-
particle contributions for Cu-like ions. We will discuss
how these matrix elements are combined to obtain the
one- and two-particle contributions to energies of Cu-like
ions. We refer the reader to Ref. [15, 16] for a discussion
of the how the basic one- and two-particle matrix ele-
ments were evaluated. An intrinsic particle-particle-hole
diagram also contributes to the second-order energy for
Cu-like ions. It should be noted that the angular part
of the expression for the particle-particle-hole diagram
diﬀers from the corresponding expression for the three-
particle matrix elements given in Ref. [19]. A detailed
discussion of this diﬀerence is given in Ref. [1].

Table I (see also Table II of [18]) provides an illustra-
tion of various contributions to the second-order energies
for the special case of Cu-like tungsten, Z = 74. In this
table, we show the one-body, two-body and three-body
second-order Coulomb contributions to the energy matrix
labelled as E(2)
, i = 1, 2, 3, The one-body second-order
i
energy, E(2)
is obtained as the sum of the two valence and
one hole E(2)
energies. The values of E(2)
are non-zero
only for diagonal matrix elements. Even for odd-parity
states with J=1/2 there are 78 diagonal and 6006 non-
diagonal matrix elements for 4l4l′(J1)3l′′ (J) core-excited
states. We list data only for the ﬁrst ten diagonal matrix
elements of odd-parity states with J=1/2 in Table I (a
more complete set of data is given in Table II of [18]). It
can be seen from the table that two-body and three-body
second-order contributions are positive, when the one-
body contributions are negative. The three-body contri-
butions give about 20% in the total second-order contri-
butions. The values of the E(2)
non-diagonal
contributions are smaller than values of diagonal contri-
butions by factor of 3-5.

and E(2)

After evaluating the energy matrices, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors are calculated for states with given values
of J and parity. There are two possible methods to
carry out the diagonalization: (a) diagonalize the sum
of zeroth- and ﬁrst-order matrices, then calculate the

second-order contributions using the resulting eigenvec-
tors; or (b) diagonalize the sum of the zeroth-, ﬁrst- and
second-order matrices together. Following Ref. [19], we
choose the second method here.

Table II lists the energies of ten excited states of W45+
from Table I including the total energies Etot. The latter
is the sum of the following contributions: E(0+1) = E(0)
+E(1)+B(1), the second-order Coulomb and Breit energy
E(2), and the QED correction ELAMB. The QED correc-
tion is approximated as the sum of the one-electron self
energy and the ﬁrst-order vacuum-polarization energy.
The screened self-energy and vacuum polarization data
given by Kim et al. [14] are used to determine the QED
correction ELAMB (see, for detail Ref. [1]). As can be
seen, the second order correction contributes to the total
energy from 0.4 % for lowest levels up to 8 % for high-
excited levels. The levels in this table (see also Table
III of [18]) could be divided into groups corresponding to
excited 4l4l′ states and 3l hole states.

C. Dipole matrix element

We designate the ﬁrst-order dipole matrix element by
Z (1), the Coulomb-correction to the second-order matrix
element Z (2), and the second-order Breit correction B(2).

follows the pattern of the corresponding calculation for
Na-like ions in Ref. [2]. These matrix elements are cal-
culated in both length and velocity gauges.

Table III lists values of uncoupled ﬁrst-and second-
order dipole matrix elements Z (1), Z (2), B(2), together
with derivative terms P (derv) for Cu-like tungsten, Z =
74. For simplicity, only the values for the selected dipole
transitions between odd-parity states with J = 1/2 and
the ground 4s and excited 4d3/2 states are presented.
The more comprehensive set of data is given in Table IV
of [18]). The derivative terms shown in Table III arise
because transition amplitudes depend on energy, and the
transition energy changes order-by-order in RMBPT cal-
culations. Both length (L) and velocity (V ) forms are
given for the matrix elements. We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst-
order matrix elements Z (1)

FIG. 1: Weighted transition rates between core-excited odd-
parity states with J = 1/2 and 4s 2S1/2 states as function of
Z in Cu-like ions.

L - V diﬀerences between second-order matrix elements
are much larger for some transitions. The term P (derv)
in length form almost equals Z (1) in length form but in
velocity form is smaller than Z (1) in length form by three
to four orders of magnitude.

Values of line strengths calculated as a square of cou-
pled reduced matrix element [2] in length and velocity
forms are given in Table IV for the selected dipole tran-
sitions between odd-parity states with J = 1/2 and the
ground 4s and excited 4d3/2 states. A more complete
set of data is given Table V of [18]. Although we use
an intermediate-coupling scheme, it is nevertheless con-
venient to label the physical states using the jj scheme.
We see that L and V forms of the coupled matrix ele-
ments in Table IV diﬀer only in the third or fourth dig-

its. These L–V diﬀerences arise because our RMBPT
calculations start with a non-local Dirac-Fock (DF) po-
tential. If we were to replace the DF potential by a lo-
cal potential, the diﬀerences would disappear completely.
The ﬁrst two columns in Table IV show L and V values

of line strengths calculated in the ﬁrst-order approxima-
tion which diﬀer by factor of 10. Thr last two columns
indicate that including of the second-order contribution
almost removes the L − V diﬀerences.

III. RESULTS AND COMPARISONS WITH
OTHER THEORY AND EXPERIMENT

We calculate energies of core-excited even-parity
4lj4l′j′(J1)3l′′j′′ as well as the singly excited 4lj states
in Cu-like ions with Z = 30 -100. Reduced matrix ele-
ments, line strengths, oscillator strengths, and transition
rates are also determined for electric dipole transitions
between the above mentioned core-excited and singly ex-
cited states in Cu-like ions for the same range of Z.

Table V lists theoretical data for selected transitions
from core-excited levels to the ground 4s and a singly ex-
cited 4p1/2 levels with largest values of transition rates in
W45+. Also, the comparison of theoretical data produced
by the diﬀerent methods and codes is inlcuded. Specif-
ically, three values for wavelengths: λMCDF, λRMBPT,
and λcowan are compared. The ﬁrst values, λMCDF, were
obtained as the ﬁrst-order RMBPT values.
It can be
seen from Table V that the results obtained by cowan
code [20], λcowan, better agree with the MCDF results,
λMCDF than with the RMBPT results, λRMBPT.

cowan code [20] gives results which are generally in
good agreement with experimental energies by scaling
the electrostatic Slater parameters to include the corre-
lation eﬀects (Refs. [21]) and here the scaling factor of

4lj states in Cu-like Ce, W, and Au ions. Comparison of

imental measurements (λexpt) from Ref. [12] (a), Ref. [5] (b),

0.85 was used. Also, in cowan code the LS coupling
scheme is implemented and corresponding LS designa-
tions were added to jj designations in all tables which
include comparisons with theoretical data produced by
cowan code.

A comprehensive set of theoretical data and compar-
isons for transitions with largest values of transition rates
in W45+ similar to presented in Table V is given in Ta-
ble VI of the accompanying EPAPS document [18].
It
includes transitions from core-excited levels not only to
the ground 4s and to one singly excited level 4p1/2 as in

6

Table V but to all singly excited 4lj levels.

The similar comprehensive set of theoretical data and
comparisons for transitions between core-excited states
4lj4l′j′(J1)3l′′ J to the ground 4s and singly excited 4lj
states is presented for Ce29+ ion in Table VII of Ref. [18]
and for Au50+ ion in Table VIII of Ref. [18]. Comparisons
with theoretical data obtained by using RMBPT, MCDF,
and cowan codes show that the diﬀerence in results can
be explained by the second-order corrections to energy
and dipole matrix elements included in RMBPT.

The trends of the Z-dependence of transition rates for
the transitions from core-excited odd-parity states with J
= 1/2 to the ground state 4s 2S1/2 states are presented in
Fig. 1 . The trends for the transitions from core-excited
even-parity states with J = 1/2 to the singly excited state
4p 2P3/2 are shown in Fig. 2. More transition rate ﬁgures
are given in [18].

We see from the graphs that transitions with smooth
Z-dependence are rarer than transitions with sharp fea-
tures. Smooth Z-dependence occurs for transitions from
doublet and quartet core-excited states. Usually, singu-
larities happen in the intermediate interval of Z = 40 -
60 when neither LS nor jj coupling schemes describe the
states of these ions properly. One general conclusion that
can be derived from these graphs is that the smooth Z-
dependence occurs more frequently for transitions from
low-lying core-excited states.

Singularities in the transition-rate curves have two
distinct origins: avoided level crossings and zeros in
dipole matrix elements. Avoided level crossings result
in changes of the dominant conﬁguration of a state at a
particular value of Z and lead to abrupt changes in the
transition rate curves when the partial rates associated
with the dominant conﬁgurations below and above the
crossing point are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Zeros in tran-
sition matrix elements lead to cusp-like minima in the
transition rate curves. Examples of each of these two
singularity types can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, as well as
in Figs. 1 - 10 presented in EPAPS document [18].

In Table VI, wavelengths and electric-dipole transition
rates along with comparison with experimental data are
presented for transitions in Cu-like Ce, W, and Au. The
table is limited to identiﬁcation of experimentally mea-
sured transitions given in Refs. [5, 6, 12]. A more com-
prehensive set of theoretical data assigned to each ex-
perimental transition is presented in Table IX of EPAPS
document [18]. We mentioned previously that all possi-
ble 4l1j14l2j2(J1)3l3j3(J) - 4lj transitions produce 2294
spectrum lines. These lines in Ce29+, W45+, and Au50+
cover the spectral regions from 6.8 – 21.9 ˚A , 3.5 – 9.8
˚A , and 2.9 – 8.7 ˚A , respectively. A number of spectral
lines becomes smaller by a factor of ten when we con-
sider transitions with largest values of transition rates,
gAr. The number of transitions with gAr > 1013 s−1 is
about 200 for Ce29+, and a number of transitions with
gAr > 1014 s−1 is about 130 for W45+ and about 190 for
Au50+. Those transitions with the largest values of gAr
cover the spectral regions smaller by factor of 3-4 than

that mentioned for all lines. We can see that the number
of predicted spectral lines even with the largest values
of gAr still much larger than a number of experimental
lines shown in Table VI. Also, the interval between these
lines is about 0.01 ˚A or less which is comparable with the
accuracy of experimental measurements. In this case, it
could be reasonable to assign not a single transition as in
Table VI but 3-5 transitions to identify the experimen-
tal peak, as it is demonstrated in Table IX of EPAPS
document [18].

These atomic data are important in modeling of M-
shell radiation spectra of heavy ions generated in elec-
tron beam ion trap experiments and in M-shell diagnos-
tics of plasmas. For example, x-ray M-shell spectra of
W ions collected at the diﬀerent energies of the electron
beam at LLNL electron beam ion trap indicate the ex-
istence of strong Cu-like spectral features [22]. Also,the
distinct features of x-ray M-shell spectra of W ions in
a spectral region from 5 to 6 ˚A produced by labora-
tory plasmas are the brightest Ni-like lines and Co- and
Cu-like spectral features. In particular, Cu-like satellite
lines constitute most of the Cu-like spectral features, and
Cu-like autoionization levels make an important contri-
bution in ionization balance calculations [23]. Synthetic
x-ray spectra of Cu-like W computed with diﬀerent res-
olution of 0.02 ˚A and 0.002 ˚A are presented in Fig. 3
and 4, respectively. It was assumed that spectral lines
have the intensities proportional to the weighted transi-
tion probabilities and are ﬁtted with the Gaussian proﬁle.
Speciﬁcally, the spectrum in Fig. 3 includes 3l − 4l′ tran-
sitions and covers the spectral region from 4 ˚A to 6.4 ˚A.
The most intense peaks at about 5.72 ˚A and 5.9 ˚A are
formed by 3d − 4f transitions and are shown with better
resolution in Fig. 4.

IV. CONCLUSION

the

energies

and transition rates

In summary, a systematic second-order RMBPT
study of
for
[4l1j14l2j2(J1)3l3j3 (J) - 4lj] electric-dipole transitions
in Cu-like ions with the nuclear charges Z ranging from
30 to 100 has been presented. The retarded E1 matrix
elements included correlation corrections from Coulomb
and Breit interactions. Both length and velocity forms
of the matrix elements were evaluated and small diﬀer-
ences (0.4 - 1 %), caused by the non locality of the start-
ing DF potential, were found between the two forms.
Second-order RMBPT transition energies were used in
the evaluation of transition rates. These calculations
were compared with other calculations and with avail-
able experimental data. For Z ≥ 40, we believe that the
present theoretical data are more accurate than other
theoretical or experimental data for transitions between
the 4l1j14l2j2(J1)3l3j3 (J) core-excited states and the 4lj
singly excited states in Cu-like ions. The results could
be further improved by including third-order correlation
corrections.These calculations are presented as a theo-
retical benchmark for comparison with experiment and
theory. In addition, the application of generated atomic
data to modeling and interpreting of x-ray M-shell spec-
tra of heavy ions is discussed.

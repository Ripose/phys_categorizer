We show why a dynamically varying ﬁne structure constant does not impact on the Webb group’s
analysis as suggested by Bekenstein. We also provide a limit on the size of a possible correction to
the Dirac Hamiltonian caused by a perturbation due to a dynamically varying α in hydrogen.

INTRODUCTION

The possible variation of the ﬁne structure constant,
α, is currently a very popular research topic. Webb et al.
[1] have found evidence of α variation by analyzing ab-
sorption lines in QSO spectra. However, recently Beken-
stein [2] has questioned the validity of the Webb group’s
analysis. Bekenstein shows that within the framework of
dynamical α variability the form of the Dirac Hamilto-
nian relevant for an electron in an atom departs from the
standard form. Unfortunately no self consistent quantum
electrodynamic theory was derived.
Instead the Dirac
Hamiltonian, ˆH, was presented for an electron bound by
a Coulomb ﬁeld:

ˆH = ˆH0 + δ ˆH
ˆH0 = (−ı¯hcα · ∇ + mc2β + eΦI)
2
δ ˆH = (I − β) tan

χ · VC

where VC = −Zα/r. The last term is related to an eﬀec-
tive correction to the Coulomb ﬁeld due to the dynamical
nature of α, and tan2 χ is a small parameter. In other
words, a dynamically varying ﬁne structure constant can
be accounted for as a perturbation of the Dirac Hamil-
tonian. This perturbative term, δ ˆH, vanishes in a non-
relativistic approximation but it produces some relativis-
tic corrections which can be studied both in astrophysical
spectra and laboratory conditions.

In the following sections we will show how this pertur-
bation shifts atomic energy levels. In particular we pay
attention to heavy atoms which provide us with astro-
physical data and are the most sensitive to a possible α
variation. We also consider atomic hydrogen, since it is
the best understood atomic system for laboratory exper-
iments.

HEAVY ATOMS

Heavy atoms are of interest to us since they are the
most sensitive to a varying α. We performed a calcula-

tion to show how the modiﬁed form of the Dirac Hamilto-
nian eﬀects the energy of an external electron in a heavy
atom. We averaged δ ˆH, presented in Eq. (3), over the
relativistic wave function for electrons near the nucleus
[3] at zero energy. The use of the wave function for the
electrons at zero energy is justiﬁed by noting that the
main contribution to the electron’s energy comes from
distances close to the nucleus, r ∼ a/Z [4]. At a distance
of one Bohr radius, r ∼ a, the potential is screened by
the other electrons and the potential energy is given by
VC ∼ mα2. This is of the same order of magnitude as
the binding energy of the electron, E ∼ mα2. However,
inside the Bohr radius at r ∼ a/Z, screening is negligible
and VC ∼ Z 2mα2. Inside this region VC ≫ E and so the
binding energy of the electron can be safely ignored.

The non-relativistic limit of δE was taken. This gave:

amc2α2/(2ν2) is the energy of the elec-
tron, and Za is the charge “seen” by the electron - it is
1 for atoms, 2 for singly charged ions etc.

It is interesting to note that this correction to the en-
ergy of the electron has exactly the same form as the
relativistic correction, ∆, to the energy of an external
electron:

This makes the eﬀect of the modiﬁed form of the Dirac
Hamiltonian indistinguishable from a small change in α2
in Eq. (5). Since Eq. (4) and (5) are directly propor-
tional, and tan2 χ is necessarily small, there is no need for
any modiﬁcation to the Webb group’s analysis in heavy
atoms since tan2 χ is accommodated into the change of
α.

In this derivation we assumed that we could consider
the unscreened Coulomb ﬁeld, this is clearly not the case
for a valence electron in a many electron atom. We justify
this assumption by once again noting that the main con-
tribution to the energy is given by distances close to the

nucleus, of the order of the Bohr radius over Z, r ∼ a/Z.
At this distance the only screening comes from the 1s
electrons and we can use Slater’s rules to give the more
correct version of Eq. (4) and (5):

This describes non hydrogen-like or helium-like ions or
atoms. This does not eﬀect the proportionality of the
two terms and makes very little diﬀerence to the energies
in heavy atoms. Consideration of many-body corrections
has shown that this does not change the proportionality
relationship either.

The case is somewhat simpliﬁed for the hydrogen atom
and other hydrogen-like ions as there are no inter-electron
interactions. There are also very accurate experimental
measurements of transition frequencies in hydrogen.

We conﬁrm Bekenstein’s result [2] that applying the

The most accurate measurements in hydrogen atoms
are related to 1s−2s, 2s−ns and 2s−nd transitions with
n = 8, 10, 12. However, the data cannot be used directly
to ﬁnd δE, the diﬀerence between the experimental and
theoretical energy of a level, since it is necessary to deter-
mine a value of the Rydberg constant and the 1s Lamb
shift. The latter can be calculated theoretically with a
relatively large uncertainty due to the proton radius [5]
and the uncertainty of a direct experimental determina-
tion is also quite high. If one intends to extract a value
of tan2 χ, data of at least three accurate measurements
should be used to obtain a self consistent answer. How-
ever, in addition to the 1s − 2s transition, only data of
the 2s − ns/d transitions are available with a compara-
ble accuracy (see the compilation [8]), and they are only
very weakly sensitive to the value of n, due to the 1/n4
scaling, and thus the sensitivity of such a test is quite
low.

Fortunately there is another approach which needs nei-
ther a value of the Rydberg constant nor the 1s Lamb

shift. It is based on a comparison of theoretical and ex-
perimental data for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 splitting. The ex-
perimental value

f2p3/2→2p1/2 (exp) = 10 969 045(15) kHz

(10)

is derived from two experimental results,

f2s1/2→2p3/2 (exp) = 911 200(12) kHz
f2s1/2→2p1/2 (exp) = 1 057 845(9) kHz

(11)

(12)

presented in [6] and [7] respectively. It has to be com-
pared with a theoretical value which we take from a com-
pilation [8] (see also review [9])

f2p3/2→2p1/2(theory) = 10 969 041.2(1.5) kHz .

the

f2p3/2→2p1/2 (exp) = f2p3/2→2p1/2 (theory)(1 + 2 tan2 χ)
(15)
Using the values above, this tells us that tan2 χ = 2(7) ×
10−7. This is consistent with an α that is not varying
dynamically within this framework.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, using the modiﬁed form of the Dirac
Hamiltonian does not eﬀect the Webb group’s analysis.
The Webb group’s results can not distinguish between
the α variability from phase transitions and dynamical
α variability. The most stringent limit we can place on
Bekenstein’s [2] tan2 χ parameter is tan2 χ = 2(7)×10−7.
This is consistent with no dynamical α variability accord-
ing to the framework laid out in Bekenstein’s paper [2].
We should also mention that such a weak limita-
tion was obtained only because we had to apply an ef-
fective operator δ ˆH which vanishes in a leading non-
relativistic approximation. A self consistent quantum
electrodynamic theory with a dynamically varying α
should meet some even stronger constraints due to a
comparison of the value of the ﬁne structure constant
from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
(α−1 = 137.035 998 80(52) [10]) which should have a cor-
rection of fractional order of tan2 χ and other values of α
which are mostly derived via a complicated chain of re-
lations with α eventually coming from the Rydberg con-
stant and thus quite weakly aﬀected by δ ˆH (the fractional
value of the correction is to be of order of α2 tan2 χ) and
hence allowing one to extract δα/α ∼ tan2 χ. Such a

comparison will likely lead to a limitation on tan2 χ at
a level of a few parts in 10−8. E.g. the most accurate
result obtained this way is α−1 = 137.036 000 3(10) [11]
and thus δα/α = 11(8) × 10−9. Another set of questions
due to a modiﬁed version of QED should target its gauge
invariance, renormalizability and Ward identities, which
supports the same charge for electrons and protons. The
current QED construction is quite fragile and it is not
absolutely clear if it can be successfully extended. All
these questions need to be answered clearly before any
modiﬁcation of QED is considered seriously.

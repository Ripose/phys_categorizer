Abstract

A pump-probe atomic parity violation (APV) experiment performed in a longitu-
dinal electric ﬁeld ~El, has the advantage of providing a signal which breaks mirror
symmetry but preserves cylindrical symmetry of the set-up, i.e. this signal remains
invariant when the pump and probe linear polarizations are simultaneously rotated
about their common direction of propagation. The excited vapor acts on the probe
beam as a linear dichroic ampliﬁer, imprinting a very speciﬁc signature on the detected
signal. Our diﬀerential polarimeter is oriented to yield a null result unless a chiral-
ity of some kind is acting on the excited atoms. Ideally, only the APV ( ~El-odd) and
the calibration ( ~El-even) signals should participate in such a chiral atomic response, a
situation highly favourable to sensitive detection of a tiny eﬀect. In the present work
we give a thorough analysis of possible undesirable defects such as spurious transverse
ﬁelds or misalignments, which may spoil the ideal conﬁguration and generate a chiral
response leading to possible systematics. We study a possible way to get rid of such
defects by performing global rotations of the experiment by incremental angular steps
φ, leaving both stray ﬁelds and misalignments unaltered. Our analysis shows that
at least two defects are necessary for the ~El-odd polarimeter output to be aﬀected;
a cos (2φ) modulation in the global rotations reveals the transverse nature of the de-
fects. The harmful systematic eﬀects are those which subsist after we average over
four conﬁgurations obtained by successive rotations of 45◦. They require the presence
of a stray transverse electric ﬁeld. By doing auxiliary atomic measurements made in
known, applied, magnetic ﬁelds which amplify the systematic eﬀect, it is possible to
measure the transverse E-ﬁeld and to minimize it. Transverse magnetic ﬁelds must
also be carefully compensated following a similar procedure. We discuss the feasibility
of reducing the systematic uncertainty below the one percent level. We also propose
statistical correlation tests as diagnoses of the aforementioned systematic eﬀects.

Introduction

Im Epv

Atomic Parity violation (APV) experiments have been motivated by their ability to probe
neutral current weak interactions in conditions very diﬀerent from particle physics experi-
ments of all kinds and hence to yield valuable complementary information [1]. They probe
the electron-quark electroweak interaction at distance scales very diﬀerent from those ex-
plored in high energy measurements. Moreover, in atoms all the quarks contribute coherently
while at high energies the nuclei and even the nucleons are broken and the quarks act in-
dependently. In atoms the issue at stake is the detection of a tiny electric dipole transition
amplitude, strictly forbidden by the laws of electromagnetism, but allowed by the weak
interaction which breaks mirror-symmetry. APV can “show up” in several ways: optical
rotation in allowed M1 transitions [2, 3, 4], or electroweak interference eﬀects in the tran-
sition probability of an E-ﬁeld-assisted forbidden atomic transition [5], which aﬀects either
the population [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] or the orientation in the upper state [5]. In the latter case, the
detection always relies on some ﬂuorescence light monitoring with or without polarization
analysis. Since the interference term involves the product of the parity violating ampli-
tude Epv
1 and the E-ﬁeld induced amplitude, βE, while the transition rate is proportional
2, the left-right asymmetry,
1 /βE, decreases as 1/E. More recently, our
βE

group has demonstrated a novel kind of pump-probe experiment [11]. Here the 6S-7S highly
forbidden transition is excited in a longitudinal electric ﬁeld ~El by an intense pulse of reso-
nant light which lasts for a time shorter than the 7S lifetime. It is immediately followed by
the light pulse of a second beam, the probe, resonant with the 7S-6P3/2 allowed transition
and colinear with the excitation beam. For short pulse durations, the population inversion
produced by the pump is suﬃcient to produce transient ampliﬁcation of the probe beam.
APV shows up because the probe ampliﬁcation depends on the relative orientation of the
linear polarization of the excitation laser ˆǫex and the probe laser ˆǫpr. Speciﬁcally, there
is a chiral contribution to the optical gain of the vapor characterized by the pseudoscalar
~El) which takes opposite values for two mirror-image conﬁgurations, as
(ˆǫex ·
for instance those observed in the two channels of our polarimeter monitoring ˆǫpr (
3). A
§
9% accurate measurement [11], being currently improved, has validated the method. One of
its advantages is to provide an independent method of APV measurement. It is well known
that one of the main diﬃculties in measuring the very small APV eﬀects lies in the dis-
crimination against systematic eﬀects. These have diﬀerent origins depending on the chosen
conﬁguration, hence the importance of a new conﬁguration. In addition, this stimulated
emission detection scheme beneﬁts from several attractive features: dark-ﬁeld detection of
the left-right asymmetry, reliable, line shape independent calibration procedure, ampliﬁ-
cation of the asymmetry itself. For instance, the right-left asymmetry instead of being a
decreasing function of the applied ~El-ﬁeld beneﬁts from an ampliﬁcation mechanism via
propagation of the probe beam through the optically thick excited vapor [12].

ˆǫpr)(ˆǫex ∧

ˆǫpr ·

Moreover, the cylindrical symmetry of the experiment, another original feature, plays an
important role: the ampliﬁcation asymmetry is expected to remain invariant under simulta-
neous rotations of the polarizations ˆǫex and ˆǫpr around their axis of propagation [13]. In the
present paper, we explain how this property can be exploited to discriminate against parity
conserving (PC) signals generated by imperfections, because of their variation under these
rotations. Although some of these signals simulate the PV eﬀect in a given polarization
conﬁguration, their signatures are signals which break cylindrical symmetry. A schematic
of the ideal experiment represented on Fig. 1 shows the two orthogonal symmetry planes
deﬁned by the electric ﬁeld ~El and the linear excitation polarization ˆǫex. APV gives rise
to a tilt of the optical axes of the excited vapor out of those planes. The incoming probe
polarization chosen either parallel or perpendicular to that of the excitation beam provides a

analyzed simultaneously by our polarimeter (ˆǫX

the probe polarization at + and
in a balanced mode, the probe ampliﬁcation diﬀerence, i.e.
the right-left asymmetry, is
directly extracted for each excitation laser pulse from the optical signals S1, S2, recorded
for the two channels. The PV left-right asymmetry is expected to remain invariant under
a global rotation of the experiment, performed by rotating the polarimeter and beam polar-
izations altogether around the common beam axis. This important test can reveal defects
such as transverse ~E or ~B ﬁelds which remain ﬁxed in the laboratory frame while the po-
larizations are rotated. We discuss how this can be used to minimize the systematic errors
below a known level. This is even more important given that we are currently improving
our experiment with the aim of reducing the statistical error down to the one percent level.

In this paper we ﬁrst explain the origin of the chiral optical gain in terms of a parity
violating contribution to the atomic alignment in the 7S state induced by linearly polarized
2). Next, we introduce a general formalism necessary for a rigorous
6S-7S excitation (
§
treatment of experimental defects (
. 3). The basic principle of our polarimetry measure-
§
ments is presented and used to obtain the relation between the PV atomic alignment in the
. 3). This relation is useful
excited state and the “atomic” imbalance of the polarimeter (
§
to predict the variations of the signals generated by defects under simultaneous rotations
R(ˆk, φ) of the input polarizations ˆǫpr and ˆǫex about the common beam direction ˆk by an
angle φ, which leave invariant the APV and the calibration signals. As an example we treat
the perturbation induced by the simultaneous presence of transverse electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, ~Et and ~Bt. We show that this leads to a parity conserving, magnetoelectric opti-
cal eﬀect, which, depending on the property of ~Et and ~Bt under the ~El-ﬁeld reversal, may
simulate the PV signal in a ﬁxed ˆǫex, ˆǫpr conﬁguration, but which exhibits characteristic

3

. 4). In this particular case, it is easy
modulations under rotations of the polarizations (
§
to arrive at a judicious choice of the rotation angle φ. We show that only four diﬀerent
ˆǫex, ˆǫpr conﬁgurations are necessary to extract maximal information about the systematic
eﬀect generated by the stray ﬁelds: namely those generated from an initial conﬁguration
by three steps of successive 45◦ rotations of both ˆǫex and ˆǫpr. This result can be extended
to systematics arising from two transverse magnetic ﬁelds, one odd, and the other even in
~El-reversal (
. 5). This property is further extended and can be associated to the most gen-
§
eral structure of the atomic density matrix for the 7S state. We show that a misalignment
of the excitation and probe beams can have the same eﬀect as a transverse magnetic ﬁeld.
Finally, taking into account the possible magnitude of the residual defects on our set-up,
we discuss at what level we might reasonably expect to reduce the systematic uncertainty
(
6.). In addition, we present a quite independent diagnosis based on a statistical test to
§
be performed on the PV data which could reveal the presence of a harmful systematic eﬀect
of magnetoelectric origin.

2 APV manifestation via a chiral optical gain

2.1 APV contribution to the angular anisotropy in the excited state

When an atomic vapor is excited with a linearly polarized laser beam, resonant at the
frequency of an E1 allowed transition, it is easily veriﬁed that the excited state posseses an
alignment with a privileged direction determined by the polarization of the excitation beam.

This equation has a simple physical interpretation: the eﬀect of the PV transition amplitude
is equivalent to a rotation of the linear polarization ˆǫex about ~El by the small angle θpv,

1.7 kV/cm. The sense of this rotation changes when the
direction of ~El is reversed. The angle θpv is the important parameter to be determined
since it yields the ratio between the PV and the Stark amplitudes. Provided the El-ﬁeld
magnitude is known, one can use a value of θpv to obtain the weak charge QW of the Cs

2.2 Alignment tensor of the excited state.

The Stark-induced transition creates an excited state 7S, F ′ endowed with an alignment.
For the sake of completeness we summarize here some basic deﬁnitions. First we introduce
the second-rank tensor operator ˆT (2) constructed from the total angular momentum ~F . In
order to avoid unnecessary algebraic complications we shall use a cartesian basis set:

2.2.1 General expression

For the Stark-induced transition induced by the vector polarizability, in contrast to allowed
electric dipole ones, the preferred direction of the excitation process is not ˆǫex but rather the
orthogonal direction ˆEl ∧
ˆǫex. If we ignore the PV contribution, the alignment created in the
excited state can be represented by an ellipsoid of revolution symmetry about a direction
parallel to ˆk
ˆǫex which preserves the planes of symmetry of the experiment deﬁned by the
common direction of ~El and ˆk and by ˆǫex (see Fig. 1). The eﬀect of the PV contribution
is to tilt this ellipsoid about ~El by the small angle θpv. As a result, the alignment no
longer preserves the symmetry planes of the experiment: this is the manifestation of parity
violation in the pump-probe experiment discussed presently.

We are going to present a formalism which can be applied to more general situations
7S transition and which will allow us to incorporate the Epv

cylindrical symmetry of the ideal experiment. The eﬀective transition operator Tef f is then

2.2.4 Absence of alignment induced by the Stark-M1 interference.
The M1 contribution to the vector ~b appearing in Eq.(5) is given by ~bM1 = M1ˆk

vanishes since (bSt)i (bM1 )∗
j is clearly imaginary. In conclusion, the Stark-M1
interference term does not contribute to the alignment tensor within the hypotheses leading to
Eq.(12) . A crucial one of these concerns the 6S, F density matrix which is assumed to be a
thermal distribution: ρg ∝
PF . This property does not hold in presence of a static magnetic
ﬁeld ~B, if the excitation beam intensity varies signiﬁcantly within a frequency interval of the
order of the Zeeman splittings. We will show later on, that if ~E has a component transverse
to ~k, then the Stark-M1 interference leads to a non-zero alignment contribution.

It is worth stressing the importance of the result obtained in this section. The M1-
Stark interference is a potential source of systematics which has required special care in all
experiments performed on highly forbidden transitions in the transverse ﬁeld conﬁguration so
far [5, 10]. Thus the absence of M1-Stark interference in the longitudinal ﬁeld conﬁguration
examined here is a signiﬁcant advantage. In this conﬁguration, it is clear that the π/2 phase
diﬀerence between the M1 and the Stark amplitudes prevents there being any interference

whatever the excitation polarization, and this even if the atomic system is perturbed by a
magnetic ﬁeld.

It is only in presence of a stray transverse electric ﬁeld that we shall have to consider

the possibility of systematic eﬀects associated with the magnetic dipole amplitude.

2.3 Optical anisotropy resulting from the APV alignment

−

While the population inversion causes an ampliﬁcation of the probe beam, its polarization
is altered by the angular anisotropy created in the excited state. We obtain the atomic
anisotropies in the excited state by detecting the optical anisotropies that they induce on
the ampliﬁed probe beam. Here the vapor is endowed with an atomic alignment. Associated
with the alignment ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of refractive index for light resonant with one
6P3/2 transition. The relative magnitude of the axes
hyperﬁne component of the 7S
depends on the hyperﬁne component. The eigenaxes are those of the ellipse resulting from
the intersection of the alignment ellipsoid by a plane orthogonal to the wave vector ˆk of
the probe beam. The imaginary part of the refractive index is responsible for the gain
which takes two diﬀerent values depending on whether the linear polarization ˆǫpr is aligned
along one or the other eigenaxis, an eﬀect generally dubbed linear dichroism, while the real
part is responsible for birefringence of the vapor. For the probe beam which propagates
along ˆz, the Stark and the PV alignments both induce a linear dichroism, but the former
with axes along ˆǫex and ˆEl ∧
It is this latter
contribution, the optical anisotropy resulting from the APV alignment, which gives rise to
the APV signal in the pump-probe experiment. As a consequence the global gain matrix
of the excited vapor has its axes tilted with respect to ˆǫex by the tiny angle θpv. The
tilt is opposite for two mirror-image conﬁgurations associated with opposite signs of the
~El). Hence the notion of a chiral optical gain.
pseudoscalar
The probe polarization aligned along ˆǫex at the cell entrance actually does not lie along an
eigenaxis. Consequently its direction is modiﬁed during the propagation of the probe beam
through the vapor. This modiﬁcation is measured using polarimetry methods which allow
us to obtain an absolute determination of θpv, as explained in the next section.

The APV contribution can be seen as resulting from the dominant PC contribution via an
inﬁnitesimal rotation of angle θpv about ˆEl. By performing small rotations of the excita-
tion polarization by a known angle θcal, while keeping ˆǫpr unchanged at the input, we can
induce an optical anisotropy for the probe exactly similar to the APV one, eventhough it
is P-conserving. The ratio of these two eﬀects, measured under identical conditions and
distinguished by their opposite dependence on θcal and El reversals, yields directly θpv/θcal.
By measuring the ratio, it is possible to eliminate diﬀerent eﬀects aﬀecting the magnitude
of each signal individually which would otherwise be diﬃcult to predict quantitatively (see

3.2).

Balanced-mode polarimetry measurements on the

ampliﬁed probe beam

3.1 Operating conditions providing polarimeter imbalances insen-

sitive to the PC alignment

Since we want to measure a small PV anisotropy in presence of a large PC one, we orient
the polarimeter so that it is insensitive to the latter, and fully sensitive to the former. We
have chosen a polarization beam splitter cube having its axes ˆX and ˆY oriented at
45◦ to
the excitation and probe polarizations. The input probe polarization is a superposition of
the two eigenpolarizations, ˆǫX and ˆǫY of the polarimeter:

±

ˆǫpr = (ˆǫX + ˆǫY )/√2.

(16)

In absence of the excitation beam, the electronic gains of the two channels are adjusted
to ensure equality of the probe signals detected in both channels, SX = SY . However,
due to possible drifts in the electronic or optical components, one has to isolate the true
atomic contribution to the imbalance. For each excitation laser pulse, the imbalance for
the ampliﬁed probe pulse, Damp = (SX −SY )
(SX +SY ) is compared with a reference value Dref ,
measured when all the 7S excited atoms have decayed. Thus the doubly diﬀerential signal,
Damp
Dref , selects at the laser repetition rate a true atomic eﬀect, Dat, free of the
polarization defects present on the probe beam path.

3.2 Relation between atomic alignment and polarimeter imbalance

Since the probe polarization is adjusted at cell entrance to be parallel to ˆǫex = ˆy which
(without APV) deﬁnes the eigenaxes of the vapor gain, it should remain parallel to one eigen
axis of the gain during propagation through the vapor. An atomic imbalance is expected to
arise speciﬁcally from a diﬀerence of light ampliﬁcation for a probe beam polarized along ˆX
or ˆY .

In a previous publication (see [20] Eq. 20 or

5.2) we have calculated the intensity and
polarization modiﬁcation of a linearly polarized probe beam resonant for a single hyperﬁne
6P3/2. Following a similar approach, we shall

All of this means that the imbalance Dat = (SX −

for the tiny PV eﬀect using dark ﬁeld detection. In a general way such an atom-induced
imbalance should vanish unless some chirality is present in the experiment.

In Eq.(19), τ is the instant of detection which diﬀers from the instant of excitation taken
for origin of time. This means that in presence of a magnetic ﬁeld we have to take into
account the evolution of the excited state over the time interval which separates the instants
of excitation and stimulated emission.
We can write the general relation:

Dat = K

Di j · Aij (τ ) .

(23)

Several eﬀects are embodied in the evaluation of the proportionality coeﬃcient K: not only
transition probabilities depending on the hyperﬁne quantum numbers of the hyperﬁne states
connected by the probe transition [20], but also the probe pulse time and duration, the opti-
cal thickness of the vapor at the probe laser wavelength as well as saturation eﬀects induced
by the probe beam [21]. The calculation of Dat involves the problem of the ampliﬁcation
of the probe while it propagates through the vapor. This has been considered previously
both theoretically [21] and experimentally [12]. We refer the reader to previous work for the
evaluation of the ampliﬁcation factor common to both SX and SY as well as the asymmetry
SY and thereby the atomic imbalance
ampliﬁcation which aﬀects directly the diﬀerence SX −
Dat. The crucial point here is that our measurement method includes a calibration proce-
dure allowing us to eliminate K by performing ratios between atomic imbalances of diﬀerent
physical origin but similar optical properties. To do this we apply a small rotation of ˆǫex of
angle θcal around ˆz before entrance in the cell, the sense of this rotation being independent
of the direction of ˆEl . The calculation of the corresponding correction to the alignment
tensor mathematically is identical to that of ∆pvAi j(0) except for the trivial replacement

rotations of the experiment, discussed in the present paper. This eﬀect discussed previously
[23] is quoted here just for completeness.

odd) magnetic ﬁeld

A magnetic ﬁeld Bz causes Larmor precession of the angular momentum ~F about the ˆz
axis for the average duration τ which separates the time of stimulated emission from the time
of excitation. Consequently, after evolution of the density matrix in the excited state, the
Ai j(τ ) no longer lie in the symmetry planes. They deviate by an
axes of the Stark alignment
angle γBzτ (with γBz = ωF ′ being the angular precession frequency). This eﬀect is exactly
similar to the calibration eﬀect provided the angle θcal be replaced by γBzτ . A problem arises
only if the Bz ﬁeld is odd under ~El reversal, in which case there arises a signal simulating
exactly the PV eﬀect. To account for it, we measure the magnitude of the Bz-odd ﬁeld seen

by the atoms. This is performed by measuring the optical rotation (see
Bz-odd on a probe transition which is particularly sensitive 7S, F = 4
6P3/2, F = 5 [24].
In our past measurements [11] it has vanished part of the time and never exceeded 50 µG
for the rest of the time. Then, we can correct for its eﬀect on the PV signal.

In the polarimeter conﬁguration chosen here, the imbalance is not only sensitive to linear
dichroism relative to the ˆX, ˆY axes but also to an optical rotation [22]. Consequently,
a contribution to the atomic imbalance may arise from an atomic orientation in the 7S
. Strictly speaking it corresponds to an additional term in
state,
Eq.(23) (see [20]) which we have omitted here for two reasons:
i) it vanishes in the ideal
APV conﬁguration; in real conditions, only combination of imperfections can lead to a non-
zero signal; ii) instead of a linear dichroism eﬀect, this corresponds to an optical rotation
of the linear probe polarization, i.e. an optical eﬀect which our method of measurement
allows us to discriminate unambiguously against linear dichroism. The latter causes the
probe polarization to rotate towards the axis of larger gain, while the sense of the rotation
imposed by an optical activity is the same whatever the direction of the input polarization.
Therefore, in order to distinguish between both eﬀects, we use their opposite behavior when
the direction of the probe polarization is switched in the vapor cell, with a half wave plate
(λ/2)pr, from
ˆǫex, conﬁgurations respectively dubbed para and ortho. By rotating
the probe polarization through 90◦ at cell entrance and by leaving the polarimeter and
the excitation polarization unaltered, we switch the probe polarization from one bisector of
the polarimeter eigenaxes to the other. Hence, the polarimeter still operates in balanced
mode and the imbalance associated with the linear dichroism eﬀect, once calibrated, remains
identical in magnitude and sign. The eﬀect of optical rotation on the other hand changes
sign and can be rejected [22].

⊥

k

With this method, the probe polarization is rotated by 90◦ with respect to the po-
larimeter axes. Another possibility consists in applying a second 90◦ rotation to the probe
polarization outgoing from the cell. Without tilts induced by the vapor, the probe polar-
ization analyzed by the polarimeter in the ortho conﬁguration recovers the same direction
as that it has in the para one. This method a priori equivalent to the former one, has
the advantage to make easy the use of a polarization magniﬁer, a dichroic component [25]
which would otherwise come into conﬂict with measurements involving probe polarization
rotations.

3.5 Global rotation of the experiment about the beam axis

As explained previously, the balanced-mode operation of the polarimeter, favoured for op-
timal detection of small asymmetries, requires that at the cell entrance we choose either a
para or an ortho conﬁguration. When we rotate ˆǫex by 45◦ increments, we simultaneously
rotate ˆǫpr by the same angle. We do this for both the para and the ortho conﬁgurations.
Thus, eight diﬀerent pump-probe conﬁgurations (four para and four ortho) are used for the
measurements. In principle, when we rotate ˆǫex we should rotate the polarimeter in order
45◦ angle from ˆǫex, the axes of the main Stark
to ensure that its eigenaxes remain at
alignment to which we want to remain insensitive. But this operation is hardly compatible
with excellent mechanical stability. We have found that it can be advantageously replaced
by a second 45◦ rotation of ˆǫpr at the cell exit, opposite to that performed at the entrance.
All polarization rotations are performed by insertion and removal of half-wave plates placed
on each input beam and before the polarimeter on the probe emerging from the cell. The
output plates are oriented and controlled in a way which allows the analyzed probe polar-
ization, in absence of tilts induced by the vapor, always to lie along the same bisector of the
polarimeter eigen-axes, whatever the input conﬁguration of the ˆǫex, ˆǫpr polarizations.

±

We can verify that this operation, where the cell is sandwiched between two half wave
plates having their axes parallel, is physically equivalent to rotating the input polarization

12

in =

and the polarimeter by the same angle as that carried out by one half wave plate. Let
us introduce the transformation T produced by the vapor cell whose eﬀect on ˆǫprwe want
to measure and the transformation applied by insertion of a half wave plate
Sδ, which is
a symmetry with respect to the plate axes of direction δ. With the plates absent, the
polarizations at the input and output of the cell are: ˆǫout = T ˆǫin; with the input and
output plates inserted, ˆǫ′

we had applied the same transformation to the polarimeter and to the input polarization.
To simplify the following discussion we suppose hereafter that the polarimeter is rotated
in the same way as the probe polarization and that the axes ˆx, ˆy, ˆX and ˆY are linked to
the input polarizations and to the polarimeter in their global rotation about the beam axis.
During the rotations, the two components of the probe polarization along the eigen-axes of
45◦ to the input probe polarization, both in para and
the polarimeter, ˆǫX , ˆǫY , remain at
ortho conﬁgurations.

To be complete, let us mention that we insert one more half-wave plate, (λ/2)det, just
in front of the polarimeter which performs a symmetry of the outgoing probe polarization
with respect to the symmetry plane of the polarimeter, for discrimination between true
polarization tilts and instrumental imbalances [22]. Then, using the four reversals σcal =

half-wave plates (λ/2)pr and (λ/2)det respectively, the PV quantity θpv is reconstructed as

The experiment [11, 13] consists in recording successively the four values of Gy, Gx, GY , GX
of G for the four conﬁgurations ˆy, ˆx, ˆY , ˆX of ˆǫex.
In the next sections of this paper, we
show that the cylindrical symmetry can help in identifying and rejecting contributions to G
(Eq.(26)) due to transverse ~E and ~B ﬁelds, or misalignments.

3.6 Defect invariance under global rotations of the experiment

We cannot take for granted that during global rotations of the experiment about the common
beam axis all transverse ﬁelds remain invariant.
In this section we want to discuss this
assumption and present arguments which give it some support. There is no problem of
course concerning the laboratory magnetic ﬁeld imperfectly compensated, nor a possible
transverse electric ﬁeld which results from an ˆEl/ˆk misalignment and reverses with the
voltage applied to the cell. But one may be concerned by the behavior of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds arising from the space charge developped inside the cesium cell. The space
charge results from photoionization taking place on the cell windows at each excitation
pulse [23]. Therefore, the question at issue here is that of a possible correlation between
the direction of the excitation polarization and the electron distribution responsible for
transverse ~Et and ~Bt ﬁelds. Would such a correlation exist, our assumption would fail.
Thus, we are concerned by the angular distribution of the electrons emitted by the surface
of a sapphire crystal normal to the trigonal symmetry axis via the photoionization process.
The linearly polarized photons, with λ = 540 nm, propagate along the symmetry axis. In
practice, the sapphire surface, at a temperature around 500 K, constitutes the internal side of
the windows of the cylindrical cell containing cesium vapor. (This latter is at saturated vapor

13

∼

pressure of a reservoir kept at 410 K). Those windows have been annealed at a temperature
of
1400 K before being mounted on the cylindrical tube. After annealing the surface is
reconstructed: we have found by AFM imaging and laser beam diﬀraction [28] the presence
of regularly spaced vicinal steps, several hundreds of nanometers apart. This situation is
known to be favorable for reducing the adsorption probability, except for edge sites which
favor chemisorption [29] but concern only a tiny fraction of the surface.

According to the ﬁndings of references [26] and [27], we shall assume that the surface
states can be constructed mainly from the Al 3p orbitals. We shall take for the density
matrix describing the surface states the following expression:

ρS =

The summation i runs over the surface aluminum atoms endowed with dangling 3p bonds due
to the presence of cesium adatoms. Under the experimental working conditions, T=500K,
the surface coverage is small. It is then reasonable to assume that the dangling Al 3p bonds
are randomly distributed on the surface so that the phase factor between the orbitals (i)
~k) is also randomly distributed. This explains why we have not

Since the incident photons belong to the optical range it is legitimate to use the dipole ap-
proximation for describing the photoionization process. Centrifugal barrier eﬀects imply that

(pe, r) the wave functions associated respectively with the 3px, 3py orbitals and the
s

Remembering that the photon momentum is along the z axis, we can write ~r
ˆǫex =
x cos(φ) + y sin(φ), where φ gives the direction of the polarization vector ~ǫex in the x, y
plane. Performing the space integral in equation (28) one sees that the ﬁrst term in the
right hand side is proportional to cos(φ)2 and the second to sin(φ)2 times the square of the
same radial integral
(pe, r). In more physical terms , it means that the
distribution of the photo-electrons has no dependence on the direction of the photon linear
polarization ~ǫex in the x, y plane. Such a result hinges on the assumption that the surface
states near the edges of the conduction band are produced mainly by Al 3px,y orbitals,
according to the authors of reference [26], section IV.A. It should be kept in mind that
to the surface density matrix ρS would indroduce a
adding a contribution
cos(φ)2 dependence in the angular distribution of the photo-electrons 1, like for instance in
the photelectric eﬀect in atomic hydrogen. No evidence for a cos(φ)2 term has been found in
the measured radial electric ﬁeld produced by the beam of surface photo-electrons acceler-
ated by an applied electric static ﬁeld normal to the surface [23]. This gives some empirical
support for the basic assumptions leading to formula (27), in particular, for the absence of
Al 3s orbital contributions.

4 Cylindrical symmetry breaking generated by trans-

verse ~Et, ~Bt ﬁelds or misalignment.

In this section, we consider the modiﬁcation of the the two-channel polarimeter imbalance
Dat resulting from the simultaneous presence of stray transverse ~Et, ~Bt ﬁelds. The important
feature of the present mechanism is that it can generate a PV-like signal which, although a
physical scalar, shares the properties of the true PV signal and in particular the cylindrical
symmetry. Fortunately, this potential source of systematic eﬀect is accompanied by another
imbalance contribution which breaks the cylindrical symmetry. In the present deviation from
the ideal conﬁguration, the imbalance signal anisotropy indicates the presence of possible
systematic eﬀect and can yield an upper bound for its magnitude.

excited state with typical values for short pump-probe delay between 5 and 15 ns, depending
mainly on the saturation. Note that the sign of the Larmor precession about ~Bt, given here

Like the PV one (Eq.(25)), this ratio is odd under ~El reversal, if the quantity ~Et ·
is even. Therefore, we have shown the possible existence of a magnetoelectric optical eﬀect
which, in a given (ˆǫex, ˆǫpr) conﬁguration, can contribute to the APV quantity, the El-odd,
calibrated linear dichroism G, deﬁned by Eq. (26).

4.2 Properties of the isotropic and anisotropic contributions

The signal corresponding to expression (31) has the symmetry properties expected for a
signal of electromagnetic origin. It is invariant under space reﬂexion. The isotropic contri-
bution only diﬀers from the APV signal by the pseudoscalar factor ~Et ·
~Bt which cancels
out only if the two transverse ﬁelds are orthogonal. It is also invariant under time reversal
since the precession angle ωτ and ~Bt are both T-odd quantities. This isotropic contribution
mimics the APV signal only if its behaviour in El-ﬁeld reversal, like that of the APV signal
is odd, that is to say if ( ~Et ·
~Bt) is itself even under this reversal: i.e. both ﬁelds are even or
both odd. Hence there are two diﬀerent contributions. When we perform successive simulta-
neous rotations of ˆǫex and ˆǫpr by increments of 45◦, ˆǫex = ˆy, ˆX, ˆx, ˆY (φ = 0◦, 45◦, 90◦, 135◦),
the transverse ﬁelds remain ﬁxed. Measuring the four calibrated linear dichroism signals
Gy, GY , Gx, GX , actually provides us with two independent evaluations of the isotropic
part:

Sxy =

(Gx + Gy) = θpv + G( ~Et, ~Bt) ,

In order to obtain G( ~Et, ~Bt) we need additional information we can actually extract from

somewhat complicated by the presence of symmetry breaking eﬀects of another kind which
lead to purely anisotropic contributions.

be predicted that this would lead to a diﬀerence between Sxy and SXY , which is not observed in our

4.3 Comment on the ~Et ·

~Bt induced magnetoelectric dichroism

We have just demonstrated theoretically the existence in our atomic system of a linear
dichroism generated by two parallel, transverse ﬁelds ~Et and ~Bt. Its magnitude is propor-
tional to ~Et ·
45◦ to the ﬁeld direction. Our observations
conﬁrm the expected magnitude (see
. 6 for a more detailed discussion). We have actually
exploited it thoroughly for controlling the stray Et-ﬁelds generated in Cs ﬁlled alumina cells
by electric charges produced by photoionization [23].

~Bt and its axes are oriented at

±

§

Such an eﬀect supported by symmetry arguments was predicted long ago by Jones [30].
Despite searches in molecular liquids, it remained unobserved until recently [31], when the
samples were placed under extreme experimental conditions: a Bt ﬁeld of 15 T and an Et
ﬁeld of 1.75 kV/cm. Therefore it is worth underlining the diﬀerences between our present
experimental conditions and those which correspond to the molecular liquid samples used for
this kind of observation: number densities about 106 times lower, magnetic ﬁelds 104 to 107
times smaller, and a transverse ~Et ﬁeld about one hundredth of the size of the longitudinal ~El
ﬁeld of comparable magnitude which provides the vapor with axial symmetry. Above all one
should bear in mind that in the present case we have a dilute atomic sample in a particularly
simple atomic state. Consequently, the eﬀect of the magnetoelectric dichroism observed on
the probe beam can be given a simple, intuitive and quantitative interpretation: the Larmor
precession of the atomic alignment generated in the excited state by interference between
the Stark-induced dipoles involving both the longitudinal and transverse components of
the electric ﬁeld. But this mechanism is not unique. For other illustrations which lend
themselves to detailed calculations also in the context of atomic vapors excited via a highly
forbidden transition, see for instance the forthcoming section 4.5 and reference [32].

4.4 Combined eﬀect of an ~Et ﬁeld and a pump-probe misalignment
We have shown in subsection 4.1 that the alignment associated with a small transverse
electric ﬁeld ~Et leads to an atomic imbalance in presence of a transverse magnetic ﬁeld ~Bt.
(The case of an El-odd ~Et ﬁeld accounts for a misalignment between the applied ~El ﬁeld
and the excitation beam direction ˆkex). We now want to show that a misalignement of the
probe beam with respect to the excitation beam leads to the same eﬀect. This deviation
from the ideal conﬁguration can be described by applying to the polarized probe beam an
inﬁnitesimal rotation by a small angle δα about a unit vector ˆn normal to the excitation
photon momentum ~kex such that δα ˆn = ˆkex ∧

It is actually not surprising that the Larmor precession and a small rotation of the probe
polarized beam lead to similar eﬀects. Both eﬀects arise from the same correction to the
i,j, via either a small rotation of this tensor itself about ˆBt in the
second-rank tensor ∆
former case, or a small rotation of the detection tensor about ˆn in the latter case. The above
exact correspondance, and in particular the change of sign, can be understood from rather
simple rotational invariance considerations 4.

4.5 Other mechanisms involving the M1 amplitude
As already noted in
2.2.4, for there to be a systematic eﬀect involving the M1 amplitude
there must also be a a transverse electric ﬁeld. We also stressed that such a ﬁeld alone
is not enough. We now show how combining both electric and magnetic transverse ﬁelds
can generate a systematic eﬀect. Since the typical value of
in our experiments
10−2, it looks like we could consider an M1-Stark-induced contribution as a third
is
order eﬀect. In reality, because the presence of a ~Bt ﬁeld makes slight mixing of the diﬀer-
ent hyperﬁne states, the M1-Stark interference eﬀect is enhanced. In fact, given that the
hyperﬁne substates are no longer pure F states, the scalar Stark amplitude α ~El ·
ˆǫex can
connect S-states having diﬀerent hyperﬁne quantum numbers. As a result, the size of the
perturbation is reinforced by a factor
10. This is why we now want to focus our

The matrix element of the scalar Stark-induced amplitude between the 6S, F and the
7S, F ′ states with F ′
= F is calculated using ﬁrst order perturbation theory 5. It is conve-
nient to write the result in terms of a correction contribution to the eﬀective dipole ~def f (see
4Let us ﬁrst illustrate this point for a simpler conﬁguration: ~a and ~b are assumed to be two physical
3-dimensional vectors and R(ˆn, φ) a rotation acting only upon the vector ~b. Let us assume further that the
scalar product ~a · (R(ˆn, φ)~b) is associated with some physical observable; it is invariant under any global
rotation R′ acting on the two vectors ~a and ~b. By choosing R′ to be the inverse of R: R′ = R−1(ˆn, φ) =
R(ˆn, −φ), we get immediately the identity:

~a · (R(ˆn, φ)~b) = R′~a · (R′ R(ˆn, φ)~b) = (R−1

(ˆn, φ)~a) · ~b .

The physical content of the above equation can be stated as follows: For a physical measurement involving
the scalar product of two vectors, the eﬀect of a rotation R acting upon the vector on the r.h.s. is identical
to that of the inverse rotation R−1 acting upon the vector on the l.h.s..

What is involved here is actually the same idendity, but applied to the contraction of two second-order
tensors, Ai j · Bi j . It is not diﬃcult to generalize. We can begin by considering the case of two factorized
tensors: Ai j = ai bj and Bi j = ci dj . The contraction of them reads: Ai j · Bi j = (~a · ~c) (~b · ~d). Let us
i j = (~a · R ~c)(~b · R ~d) =
rotate the r.h.s tensor: Bi j → BR
(R−1~a · ~c)(R−1~b · ~d) = AR
· Bi j . Then, the property can be extended to the general case by noting that
i j
an arbitrary second-order tensor Ai j can always be written as a linear combination of the nine factorized
tensors constructed from three independent vectors: ~a1, ~a2, ~a3.

i j = (R ~c)i (R ~d)j . We get immediately: Ai j · BR

5We deliberately omit here the magnetic perturbation of the 6S, F state which has a larger hyperﬁne

The last factor in the r.h.s of the above equation has been split into its isotropic and its

~Bt eﬀect, Eq. (32): the only diﬀerence lies in a reversal of the relative sign of these two
~Et ·
contributions. To satisfy the ~El−
odd behavior, here, in contrast to the previous case, the
scalar product ~Et·

it has appeared in a natural way via the contribution of the M1 amplitude and,

combined with the factor ( ~Bt ·

by contrast to the Larmor precession dependent contribution (Eq. (31)), the time no longer
appears explicitly.

One may note also the presence of the additional factor (ˆk

·

Although we are not going to present here the details of the corresponding calculation, we
would like to mention that the atomic imbalance associated to the vector Stark amplitude,
instead of the scalar one, involves this time the same angular dependence as that given by
Eq. (32). Note that this contribution is suppressed by a factor

5 Symmetry breaking by two transverse magnetic ﬁelds,

~El-odd and ~El-even

Let us suppose that two transverse magnetic ﬁelds, ~B+
t , one even and the other odd
under ~El-reversal are now the source of cylindrical symmetry breaking. Since the dominant
Stark alignment is ~El-even, those two ﬁelds having opposite behavior under ~El-reversal
can introduce an ~El-odd character in the eﬀect arising from perturbation to second order.
Diﬀerent possible mechanisms can enter into play, so we shall ﬁrst consider one of them in
detail. Afterwards, we shall present a generalization of the main features of the results.

alignment (Eq. (14)) precessing in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld acquires a detectable compo-
nent of second-order in the inﬁnitesimal precession angle ωF ′ τ = γτ Bt. The variation of ~bSt

The treatment given above can be applied without any diﬃculty to the second-order

that the magnitude and the structure of the result is valid for any kind of second-order

As mentioned previously, it is possible to generate a ~El-odd polarimeter imbalance by com-
bining a magnetic perturbation and a pump-probe misalignment. This can be viewed as re-

5.4 Absence of isotropic contribution. Anisotropy properties

For all the eﬀects considered in this section 5, the most important property already men-
tioned, is the absence of an isotropic contribution. In the quantities Sxy = 1
2 (Gx + Gy) and
SXY = 1
t eﬀect cancels out. Therefore, combining results
obtained in two diﬀerent input ˆǫex polarization conﬁgurations is suﬃcient to eliminate it as
a source of systematics. However, some inconvenience remains as a result of the associated
anisotropy.

Symmetry breaking eﬀects and ways to reduce them

We have listed in Table 1 the various candidates to systematic eﬀects arising from cylindrical
symmetry breaking defects. There are two main classes of such eﬀects. Both have their mag-
nitude characterized by a 2φ-frequency modulation when the experiment is globally rotated.
This implies that measurements in only four conﬁgurations obtained by successive rotations
of 45◦ are necessary to obtain full information. Eﬀects of the ﬁrst class are dangerous since

the amplitudes involved in the excitation process (1st column), the experimental defects
involved (2nd column) and the angular dependence under global rotation of the experiment
(3rd column). The symmetry-breaking defects are represented by a pair of dimensionless
vector ﬁelds of small magnitude. From the product of the quantities appearing in columns
2 and 3 of each line, we obtain the atomic imbalance of the polarimeter (normalized by
the calibration imbalance) which has to be compared with θpv to obtain the fractional
importance of the systematic eﬀect.

an isotropic contribution remains after our averaging the linear dichroism signal over those
four conﬁgurations and represents a systematic eﬀect superimposed on the APV signal.
However, it is accompanied by an anisotropic contribution of the same order of magnitude
which can indicate its presence. In order to reduce its magnitude one may proceed by reduc-
ing the spurious ~Et and ~Bt ﬁelds as well as the pump-probe beam misalignment. Eﬀects of
the second class provide contributions which cancel out when averaged over the four input
polarization conﬁgurations. They look harmless but in fact complicate the interpretation of
the anisotropy, when present. This is why a correlation test is particularly welcome based
on statistical data analysis which may establish absence of any signiﬁcant link between the
anisotropic and isotropic contributions (see

6.2).
We can also conclude from this discussion how important it is to obtain as much infor-
mation as possible about the stray ﬁelds and, even more so, to minimize them. We can
determine the average value of the stray ﬁelds seen by the atoms simply by exploiting the
2 G), controlled magnetic
physical eﬀects analyzed in this work. By applying “large” (

§

∼

24

ﬁelds whose direction can be chosen and reversed at will, we can isolate the magnetoelectric
dichroism described in section 4.1. From its magnitude, proportional to the stray ~Et ﬁeld
and to the applied ~Bt ﬁeld, we deduce the averaged magnitude and direction of the stray
transverse electric ﬁeld seen by the atoms inside the interaction region. We have found that
the ~El-even contribution is created by a density of electrons circulating inside the cell [23].
The ﬁeld is radially distributed around the axis of the cylindrical cell. Since it cancels for
optimal centring of the interaction region, we can reduce it. In addition, we can correct the
~El-odd contribution by making tiny tilts (a few
10−3 rad) of the cell axis with respect to
∼
the common direction of the beams. In a similar way we learn about the transverse stray
magnetic ﬁelds by deliberately amplifying the ˆB+
5.2), using an
t
applied ﬁeld ~Bt of controlled direction. In order to disentangle the eﬀects of classes 1 and 2
induced by the applied ~Bt ﬁeld, we exploit their diﬀerent behavior under global rotations of
the experiment in addition to their diﬀerent relative size when a diﬀerent detection probe
transition is used.

We note ﬁnally that optical rotation data are aﬀected by the same stray ﬁelds which
alter linear dichroism. We use this to obtain complementary information to monitor and
reduce them.

6.2 Statistical analysis of the data

A complete set of data is obtained after cycling over four orientations of the input polar-
izations and provides us with one set of values of the four quantities Gy, GY , Gx, GX , from
which we extract Sxy, SXY, the isotropic contributions and Dxy , DXY , the signal diﬀerences
which may reveal anisotropic contributions (see Eqs.(35) - (37)). According to the previous
considerations we can write:

Sxy = θpv + S

−

+

xy + S

xy ,

where we recognize, besides the expected PV contribution, two eﬀects of class 1 correspond-
ing to ~Et, ~Bt ﬁelds of odd or even behaviour in ~El reversal (superscript + or - respectively).
A similar equation holds also for SXY. On another hand, the diﬀerence signal

The experimental data are to some extent noisy (mainly because of photon noise) and
they constitute random variables. When a set of data is analyzed there are two questions
to be answered: i) is the anisotropy statistically signiﬁcant? ii) if so, is it possible to say
whether there is an associated isotropic contribution?

i) First, in a cartesian coordinate system (Dxy , DXY ) we plot one point per data set.
Figure 2 illustrates a cloud of 760 points. We look for any possible deviation of their gravity
center with respect to the origin. For the data points of Fig. 2 this deviation is too small
to be signiﬁcant, it does not exceed one standard deviation. We conclude that this data set
shows no signiﬁcant anisotropy.

the four diﬀerent orientations of the input ˆǫex , ˆǫpr polarizations: for each individual set one signal diﬀerence,
DXY = GX − GY , is plotted versus the other one Dxy = Gx − Gy. On the cloud of points thus obtained,
one looks for a distorsion with respect to a circular distribution centred on the origin. For the data presented
here the center of gravity is indicated. Within the error bars, σD = 1.8 × 10−7 rad, its coordinates merge
into the origin.

ii) Second we evaluate the correlation coeﬃcient r, between Sxy and Dxy (and similarly

between SXY and DXY ).

where < Sxy > and < Dxy > are the average values and sS and sD the standard deviations
of Sxy and Dxy taken over the sample population. Thus, we can test the hypothesis that the
population correlation is 0 against the alternative that it is not, with a chosen conﬁdence
level. According to Eq. (53), the existence of a linear relation between Dxy and Sxy indicates
that, unless the class 2 eﬀects are largely dominant or the class 1 eﬀects absent, we should
ﬁnd a correlation between those two variables. According to a classical method of statistical
analysis, see for instance [34], if the correlation turns out to be signiﬁcant, we can obtain
from the value of r an estimation of the slope of the line of regression of Dxy on Sxy , :
b =

sS
In conclusion, the absence of correlation between the variables Dxy and Sxy (and between
DXY and SXY) is an important test. It enables us to conclude whether a non-zero average
anisotropy is accompanied by an isotropic contribution which might alter the PV signal we
want to detect. More precisely, the fraction of Dxy which is correlated to Sxy, i.e. b Sxy,
yields an estimate of the systematic uncertainty which aﬀects < Sxy >.

6.3 Order of magnitude of the residual systematic eﬀect

From the discussion presented in
5. it appears that the most worrying symmetry
breaking eﬀects come from the isotropic contribution of two stray ﬁelds ~Et, ~Bt or of a pump-
probe misalignment δα combined with an ~E+
t ﬁeld. An estimate of the resulting systematic
eﬀect is directly derived from Eq. (34)

We record and average the harmful defects throughout the whole data acquisition by

period, one achieves < Et/El >

θpv, and it would make sense to go for one
18 µrad, we arrive at < GEB >
×
per cent statistically accurate measurements. Although keeping the defects reduced at this
level is diﬃcult to achieve, it does not look unfeasible. As to the geometrical pump-probe
alignment, it is achieved using a reference four-quadrant photo-cell sensitive to both the
pump and the probe beams (with respective radius 1.0 and 0.6 mm); this cell is placed
alternatively at the input and at the output of the oven, 30 cm apart. To ensure δα
≤
10−6 rad requires a centering quality of 6 µm on each quadrant cell. This seems
18
achievable, since once achieved, the initial alignment is preserved during data averaging
using servo-loops stabilizing both the pump and the probe beam positions on the initial
reference, making use of auxiliary four-quadrant cells on pick up beams.

≤

×

Finally, we mention a possible source of systematics which can be generated by the
reﬂection of the pump beam on the output window of the cell: the reﬂected beam then goes
back through the interaction region with a wave vector badly aligned with the probe wave
vector. If a stray transverse, ~El-even electric ﬁeld is also present, this favors the systematic
eﬀect GEδα. This has prompted us to extinguish the reﬂexion on our cell windows by using
temperature tuning of interferences taking place between the beams reﬂected by the inner
and outer surfaces of each window [35].

7 Conclusion

To exploit the recent progress made using a new scheme for APV detection in cesium [11],
we must suppress the systematic eﬀects in order to match the statistical noise reduction
expected in the next stage of our experiment aiming at a one percent precision.
In the
present paper, we have given a detailed discussion of a large class of systematic eﬀects which
all break the cylindrical symmetry of the ideal experimental conﬁguration involved in the
excitation and detection processes. A perfect experimental set-up would be invariant under
both symmetries. The ﬁrst is the mirror reﬂexion with respect to the plane deﬁned by the
linear polarization of the excitation beam and the electric ﬁeld ~El, colinear to this beam;
a breaking of this is evidence for APV. The second is the cylindrical symmetry around the
common direction of the pump and probe beams. In an ideal design, the PV signal would
be invariant under any global rotation of the experiment around this direction.

27

Experimental defects which break mirror symmetry do not necessarily break the cylin-
drical invariance: this is the case with a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, which happens to be
odd under ~El reversal. The eﬀect of such a ﬁeld has been considered previously [23] and we
merely recall here that an auxiliary Faraday eﬀect measured on a diﬀerent probe line allows
us to correct for it.

In the present work, our aim was to ﬁnd solutions to the broader problem arising from
the experimental defects, namely stray ﬁelds and misalignments which break both mirror
and cylindrical symmetry properties. We began by a short review of the properties of the
chiral optical gain, which gives rise to the PV signal in our experiment. This originates
from a mirror symmetry breaking contribution to the excited state atomic alignment, which
reﬂects the presence of a PV transition amplitude in the excitation process, resulting from
the weak PV electron-nucleus interaction.

On this occasion, we have found it convenient to introduce a tensor formalism for cal-
culating the atomic alignment in the excited state and the detection signal . This allows us
to incorporate in a systematic way the contributions arising from all the 6S-7S transition
amplitudes, in presence of transverse ~Et and ~Bt ﬁelds breaking the cylindrical symmetry of
the experiment. Our two-channel polarimetry measurements performed in balanced mode
provide us with a diﬀerential, pseudoscalar signal which makes possible dark ﬁeld detection
of the PV eﬀect in the ideal conﬁguration. We have derived a general expression for the
diﬀerential polarimeter imbalance, this results from the contraction of two second-rank ten-
sors, the alignment tensor and a detection tensor constructed from the eigenpolarizations of
the polarimeter.

It is remarkable that both the APV and the calibration signals are invariant under
simultaneous rotations of the input pump and probe polarizations around the direction
common to both beams. During such rotations, stray transverse ﬁelds and misalignment
remain ﬁxed so that their relative direction with respect to the beam polarizations are
modiﬁed. As a result they generate new contributions to the atomic polarimeter imbalance.
We have endeavored to answer two crucial questions:

are these contributions distinguishable from the true PV signal?

•

•

can we extract enough information from their variations observed during the rotation
of the experiment to separate the true PV signal from systematic eﬀects?

Our analysis shows that associated with each defect there is either a new contribution to the
atomic alignment tensor in the excited state or a tiny rotation of this tensor or (else) of the
detection tensor. The tensor formalism introduced at the outset of the paper is well adapted
to derive all the corrections to the imbalance to second order in the defects. In order for
there to be an ~El-odd imbalance which simulates the PV signal at least two defects must
conspire. The possible pairs can be arranged into two classes. Both have their magnitude
characterized by a cos (2φ) modulation as the rotations are performed through 180◦. After
we average the results over four conﬁgurations obtained by successive rotations of 45◦, a
systematic eﬀect may only result from the eﬀects belonging to the ﬁrst class, which involves
the presence of a transverse electric ﬁeld. To reduce the average transverse ~Et ﬁeld seen by
the atoms, we perform auxiliary sequences of measurements with a known applied magnetic
ﬁeld. We must also compensate carefully the transverse magnetic ﬁelds, using the atomic
signals described in this work.

After optimization, there is the possibility of a left-over anisotropic contribution which
could be associated both with class 1 and class 2 processes. We have found a way to get
information about the harmful class 1 isotropic contribution by showing that its ﬂuctuations
are correlated with those of the class 1 anisotropy contribution. ( No such correlation of

28

course can exist for the APV purely isotropic term). A statistical treatment of the data
yields an estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with the class 1 processes.

As an aside remark, we would like to point out that, during the course of this work, we
have established a connection between the most worrying sources of systematics, generated
by parallel components of transverse electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and the magnetoelectric
Jones dichroism [30] requiring extreme conditions for being observed in liquid samples [31].
This highlights the extreme sensitivity of highly forbidden transtions, such as the cesium
6S
7S, to the symmetry of the experimental set-up and illustrates the great variety of new
processes which can be studied both theoretically and experimentally.

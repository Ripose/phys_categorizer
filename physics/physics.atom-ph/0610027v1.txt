Abstract. We propose the novel combination of a laser guide and magnetic
lens to transport a cold atomic cloud. We have modelled the loading and guiding
of a launched cloud of cold atoms with the optical dipole force. We discuss
the optimum strategy for loading typically 30 % of the atoms from a MOT and
guiding them vertically through 22 cm. However, although the atoms are tightly
conﬁned transversely, thermal expansion in the propagation direction still results
in a density loss of two orders of magnitude. By combining the laser guide with a
single impulse from a magnetic lens we show one can actually increase the density
of the guided atoms by a factor of 10.

1. Introduction

Many cold atom experiments employ a double-chamber vacuum setup that is
diﬀerentially pumped. The ﬁrst collection chamber generally employs a high pressure
10−9 Torr) magneto-optical trap (MOT) to collect a large number of cold atoms.
(
∼
These atoms are then transported to a lower pressure ‘science’ chamber to allow for
longer trap lifetimes. The act of moving the atoms between the two regions results
in an undesired density decrease unless steps are taken to counteract the atomic
cloud’s ballistic expansion. One approach is to catch atoms launched into the science
chamber in a second MOT. However, an undesirable feature is the restriction placed
on subsequent experiments by the laser beams and magnetic-ﬁeld coils required to
realise the second MOT. An alternative approach is to focus or guide the launched
atoms such that they can be collected in a conservative trap. Eﬀorts to conﬁne the
ballistic atomic motion in the transfer process can be broadly classiﬁed as either using
the optical dipole force or the Stern-Gerlach force.

The optical dipole force arises from the gradient of the light-shift of the atomic
ground state. To minimise light-induced heating, blue detuned laser light (where the
atoms seek areas of low light intensity) or far-oﬀ resonance red-detuned light is used.

Laser guiding between chambers has been achieved both in free space [1, 2, 3] and also
within optical ﬁbers [4]. Bose-Einstein condensates have also been transported from
one chamber to another with an optical tweezer [5]. Further details of optical guiding
experiments can be found in the reviews [6].

The Stern-Gerlach force can be utilized to manipulate paramagnetic cold atoms
[7]. A variety of atomic mirrors for both cold [8] and Bose condensed atoms [9] have
been realised. Pulsed magnetic lenses for cold atoms have also been demonstrated
experimentally [10, 11, 12] and in recent work we theoretically studied and optimised
the designs of such lenses [13, 14].

It is also possible to load atoms into a magnetic trap in the ﬁrst chamber,
and transport the atoms whilst they are still trapped into the second chamber.
Greiner et al.’s scheme [15] involves an array of static coils, with the motion of the
trapped atoms facilitated by time-dependent currents in neighboring coils in the chain.
Another scheme uses coils mounted on a motorised stage, so that they can be easily
moved, thereby transporting the magnetically trapped atoms [16]. These experiments
used a three dimensional quadrupole trap, which has a magnetic zero at its centre. For
certain applications a trap with a ﬁnite minimum is required, and recently transport
of atom packets in a train of Ioﬀe-Pritchard traps was demonstrated [17].

Laser guiding eﬀectively conﬁnes atoms in the radial direction and can have the
added beneﬁt of further cooling [2]. However, in most applications atoms remain
largely unperturbed in the axial direction. In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique
that combines radial conﬁnement, via far-oﬀ resonance laser guiding, with an axially
focusing magnetic lens to transport the atomic cloud, see Figure 1. We investigate
the optimum guiding strategy both with and without magnetic lenses.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes how to optimise
laser guiding; Section 3 summarises the theory of pulsed magnetic focusing; Section 4
combines laser guiding with magnetic focusing; Section 5 contains a discussion and
conclusions about the results.

2. Laser guiding

2.1. Modelling

In this paper a speciﬁc experimental setup is modelled, however the analysis can be
easily applied to other setups. The experimental parameters below have been chosen
to be consistent with previous work at Durham University [1, 12, 13, 14].

(with corresponding velocity standard deviation σV =
and with an isotropic Gaussian spatial distribution in each Cartesian direction, with
standard deviation of σR = 0.20 mm. The atoms are launched vertically upwards
as a fountain using the moving molasses technique [18]. The initial launch velocity
is chosen so that the centre of mass parabolic trajectory will have an apex at a
height of h = 22.0 cm above the MOT centre. This requires a launch velocity of
vzi = √2gh = 2.08 m s−1. The MOT to apex ﬂight time is T =
2h/g = 212 ms.
At 18.0 cm above the MOT there is a 0.5 mm radius aperture to allow the atoms to
pass into a lower pressure ‘science’ chamber (typically 2 orders of magnitude lower
pressure). The time to reach the aperture is 121 ms for unperturbed motion.

dipole force. The dipole trap depth is proportional to the laser power. Therefore
a far-detuned guiding experiment (with negligible scattering) will always become
more eﬃcient by increasing the laser power. We have chosen to model a Nd:YAG
(λT = 1, 064 nm, subscript T used to denote the trap wavelength) guide laser that has
a maximum power of 19 W. The beam waist and focal point are chosen to optimise
the guiding eﬃciency, and this optimisation process is contained in the ﬁrst half of
the paper.

acceleration is comparable with g and 3 orders of magnitude larger than the axial case.
It is suﬃciently large to provide an adequate guide for the cold atoms. On the contrary
one wouldn’t expect to see much evidence of perturbation from the ballistic motion
in the axial direction. The length scales over which the radial and axial accelerations
change are characterised by the beam waist and the Rayleigh range respectively. The

is used in the calculation. The radial acceleration is ∼ 103 times larger than the
axial case. The dashed vertical lines in (a) and (b) are ±w0 and ±zR respectively.

2.3. Loading the guide

Calculating the guiding eﬃciency can be broken down into two separate problems:
loading atoms from the MOT into the guide and subsequent transport losses. The
fraction of atoms initially captured by the laser beam can be calculated analytically
based on the work of Pruvost et al.[2] and extended by Wolschrijn et al.[20]. An atom
will be radially bound if its total energy E is less than zero:

E =

+ U (r, z) < 0,

p 2
2m

where p =
is the radial momentum and m is the atomic mass. The
initial atom distribution can therefore be divided into two groups: energetically bound

(E < 0) and unbound (E > 0). The normalised initial position and momentum
distribution of the atomic cloud for a given temperature

is given by:

Φ(r, p) =

The loading eﬃciency, χ, is calculated by integrating Φ(r, p) and imposing the bound

loading eﬃciency is plotted against beam waist and focal point in Figure 3 (a). The
optimum 1/e2 radius for loading the modelled experiment is 252 µm, and that produces
a load eﬃciency of 28.9%. The maximum exhibits a large plateau (χ > 25% when the
1/e2 radius is between 175 µm and 360 µm) which results in ﬂexibility in choosing
initial parameters. Due to this ﬂexibility we have chosen to study laser guiding when
the beam focus coincides with the MOT centre (z0 = 0 cm). The reason for this is that
an expanding beam will cool the cloud in the radial direction during the ﬂight [2]; this
is a consequence of Liouville’s theorem. Unless otherwise stated, the results presented
will use a laser that is focused on the MOT centre (z0 = 0), see Figure 3 (b). Alongside
the analytical result a Monte Carlo simulation of atomic trajectories was performed
by solving the equations of motion that include gravity and the dipole force. The
data points on the plot show the fraction of atoms from the MOT that are initially
energetically bound and therefore satisfy equation (5).

The loading eﬃciency can be increased by using a more powerful laser, a lower
temperature atomic cloud or a smaller cloud size. The ﬁrst two are intuitively
obvious, however the reduction in cloud size is misleading because atom number is
the important experimental quantity we wish to maximise. For a MOT with constant
atom density, the atom number increases proportional to the cube of the cloud radius.
Although for large clouds a smaller cloud fraction is loaded, there is a greater number
of atoms present and therefore the overall load increases with cloud radius.

2.4. Transport losses

Having considered the initial loading of the MOT into the laser beam, attention is
now turned to the guiding properties and losses from the beam. Apart from heating
and collisions (which are assumed to be negligible) there are two loss mechanisms:
aperture truncation and diﬀraction.

2.4.1. Truncation losses Without laser guiding the transmission from a ballistically
expanded cloud passing through a 0.5 mm radius aperture at a height of 18 cm is
0.4%. With guiding this transmission can be increased by 75 times. This is shown
in Figure 4 (a) where the transmission through the aperture is plotted against height
above the MOT. The black line represents the transmission of an unguided atomic
cloud. The aperture height of 18.0 cm was chosen to minimise ballistic transmission
but still allow suﬃcient distance between the aperture and trajectory apex at 22 cm.
The red and blue lines demonstrate laser guiding for 100 µm and 250 µm beam waists
respectively. Again there is the initial decay due to the unguided atoms passing
through the aperture. However unlike the unguided case, a fraction of the atoms have
been bound in the laser guide which signiﬁcantly increases the aperture transmission.
This corresponds to the tight core evident in Figure 1 (b). There is also atom loss
from the guide due to diﬀraction. This is more obvious in the tightly focused 100 µm
beam (red line), although all expanding laser beams will suﬀer losses. This diﬀraction
loss is examined in Section 2.4.2.

laser present, the red line is with a laser of waist 100 µm and the blue line is with
a 250 µm waist. Plot (b): The transmission fraction is plotted against aperture
radius for an aperture at a height of 18.0 cm above the MOT. The distribution
consists of a tightly guided core due to a laser of waist 250 µm and the ballistically
expanded cloud (σr = 5.4 mm). The simulation follows the trajectories of 5,000
atoms to obtain the aperture transmission.

Transport of launched cold atoms with a laser guide and pulsed magnetic ﬁelds

In Figure 4 (b) there is a plot of transmission versus aperture radius at 18.0 cm
above the MOT centre. The sharp spike in the distribution is due to the guided
atoms and the broader distribution is due to the ballistically expanded atomic cloud.
The aperture size should be large enough to allow the guided atoms to pass through
unhindered. The highest achievable loading eﬃciency for the setup modelled has a
beam radius of w(z) = 349 µm at the aperture. The 1/e2 radius is twice the radial
standard deviation: w(z) = 2σr. With this deﬁnition the beam radius is σr = 175 µm
and therefore the 0.5 mm aperture has a radius of 2.86 σr, corresponding to a 99.6%
transmission through the aperture. A much larger beam radius could result in high
losses when passing through the small aperture.

2.4.2. Diﬀraction losses Away from the focus, diﬀraction causes the guiding potential
to relax. For some bound atoms this can mean their kinetic energy becomes larger
than the depth of the conﬁning potential - the atoms are therefore lost from the
guide.
Ideally a transportation scheme requires a laser proﬁle that doesn’t change
size on the scale of the guiding distance. The Rayleigh length is a good measure of
this, and therefore for eﬃcient guiding one must ensure that the transport distance
is on the order or less than the Rayleigh length. A Monte Carlo simulation of 5,000
atoms being transported within the laser guide was run to investigate the loss due
In Figure 5 (a) the red data points are the ratio of the number of

energetically bound atoms at the aperture to the number of initially bound atoms.
For small beam waists the Rayleigh length is much smaller than the transport length
and the increased diﬀraction reduces the transport eﬃciency.

Figure 5. Plot (a): The ratio of the number of energetically bound atoms at the

Values less than one represent losses due to diﬀraction. Plot (b): The fraction of
atoms passing through the aperture is plotted against beam waist. The quantity
represents the overall transport eﬃciency. The solid line in both plots is the
loading eﬃciency χ given by equation (8).

The overall transport eﬃciency is shown in Figure 5 (b). In this plot the fraction
of atoms passing through the aperture is plotted against beam waist. In addition to
the fraction of bound atoms passing through the aperture (obtained by multiplying
the two curves in Figure 5 (a)), there is an extra contribution from nearly bound
atoms that have been ‘funneled’ through the aperture. Those nearly bound were
either just outside the bound criteria of equation (5) at the initial MOT loading, or
have been lost from the guide due to diﬀraction. Their trajectories loosely follow
the laser guide, and therefore there is an increased probability of passing through

the aperture. Simulations show that the distribution of unbound atoms that are
transmitted through the aperture peaks at 6%, which accounts for the extra 4%
contribution to the transport eﬃciency curve in Figure 5 (b). The peak in the unbound
atom distribution is centred at a smaller beam waist, due to the unbound atoms having
a hotter temperature than their bound counterparts. This explains why the transport
eﬃciency curve has its peak shifted to 225 µm.

It is instructive to look at phase-space plots to get an understanding of the initial
capture and subsequent loss due to diﬀraction, see Figure 6. The left (right) column
simulates a laser with a 100 µm (250 µm) beam waist. The diﬀraction of the laser
beam can be seen by studying the evolution of the dashed E = 0 contour. The 250 µm
beam provides a better guide as it both captures more atoms initially and suﬀers from
less diﬀraction loss. In both plots the nearly bound atoms can be seen just outside
the E = 0 line. It takes a ﬁnite time for them to be ejected from the guide. It is these
atoms that are the extra contribution in Figure 5 (b).

3. Magnetic focusing theory

Laser guiding is an ideal method to deliver cold atoms with a tight radial distribution,
however it does not address the problem of the expanding axial distribution.
In
previous work we studied and optimised the focusing properties of pulsed magnetic
lenses made from current-carrying coils [13, 14].
In this paper we investigate four
diﬀerent lens designs that can focus the cloud in the axial direction whilst radial
conﬁnement is provided by the laser guide. This section provides a summary of the key
results needed to understand pulsed magnetic focusing, a comprehensive explanation
can be found in the publications referenced above.

3.1. The Stern-Gerlach force

−

An atom in a magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude B experiences a magnetic dipole interaction
energy of U =
µζB, where µζ is the projection of the atom’s magnetic moment onto
the ﬁeld direction. Provided that Majorana spin-ﬂip transitions [21] occurring in ﬁeld
zeros are avoided and the rate of change of direction of the ﬁeld is less than the Larmor
frequency the magnetic moment adiabatically follows the ﬁeld.

The Stern-Gerlach force is ~FSG =

(µζ B). The ensemble (of alkali metal
atoms) can be optically pumped into either a strong-ﬁeld-seeking (SFS) state with
µζ = µB (where µB is the Bohr magneton), or into a weak-ﬁeld-seeking (WFS) state
µB. In low ﬁeld, where the quantum numbers F and mF are good, these
with µζ =
states are the stretched states
. Atoms in these states have a
i
magnetic moment which is independent of ﬁeld, consequently the Stern-Gerlach force
takes the simpler form ~FSG =
B — i.e. the focusing of the atoms is governed
by the gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude only. The choice of whether atoms in
SFS or WFS states are launched depends on the particular application. It should be
noted that the guiding properties within the laser beam are independent of the atom’s
mF state at such large detunings.

3.2. Magnetic ﬁelds from current-carrying coils

A purely harmonic magnetic ﬁeld magnitude will result in an aberration-free lens.
Such a ﬁeld can be closely approximated with the use of current-carrying circular
coils. The ﬁelds are constrained by Maxwell’s equations, which, in conjunction with
symmetry arguments, allow the spatial dependence of the ﬁelds to be parameterised
with a small number of terms. A cylindrically symmetric magnetic coil conﬁguration
has second-order magnitude:

3.3. Pulse timing

For a given lens of strength ω2, the calculation of the pulse start time, t1, and duration,
τ , required to bring the atomic cloud to a focus at a time T is not trivial. The ﬁnite
pulse time means the atom’s position and velocity will be modiﬁed during the pulse
and therefore the simple focusing formulae of ‘thin lens’ optics cannot be used. A
mathematical transformation can be made from the lab frame of ‘thick lenses’ to ‘thin

4. Laser guiding and magnetic focusing

This section will investigate the axial focusing of atomic clouds being guided within a
laser beam with a beam waist of 250 µm. The choice of lens radius is a compromise
between a strong lens with short pulse durations (small radius) and a weak lens with
low aberrations (large radius). A 5 cm radius lens has suﬃciently low aberrations
and short enough pulse durations so as to avoid coil heating, therefore results for a
5 cm radius lens will be presented in this paper. The lens properties are tabulated
in Table 1 for the four diﬀerent lens designs studied. An experimental limit on the
maximum current ﬂowing in the coils was set at N I = 10, 000 Amps. It is interesting
to contrast the radial angular frequency of the lens with that of the laser guide. ¿From
equation (4) and the laser parameters above, the initial radial angular frequency in
the w = 250 µm laser guide is ωrL = 435 rad s−1. Therefore in the radial direction
the laser will dominate over the magnetic ﬁeld’s inﬂuence.

Table 1. The focusing properties are tabulated for the 5 cm magnetic lenses
studied in this paper. The pulse duration has been calculated for a pulse occuring
at λ = 0.5. The accelerating and decelerating axial-only lenses from Section 3.2.1
are shown in rows 1 and 2. The SFS and WFS lenses from Section 3.2.2 are shown
in rows 3 and 4. A complex angular frequency corresponds to negative curvature
and hence defocusing.

4.1. Axial only focusing

The use of a lens that does not perturb the radial motion would seem an ideal candidate
for combining with a laser guide.
In Figure 7 (a) the combined laser and the full
magnetic ﬁeld potential using elliptic integrals has been plotted. The constant B1
term has been subtracted to emphasise the axial curvature and lack of radial curvature.
For realistic lens parameters the constant acceleration’s magnitude is on the order of
100 m s−2. Typically the acceleration changes the cloud’s vertical velocity by about
1 m/s. Depending on the lens’ orientation this can either slow or accelerate the atomic
cloud’s ﬂight, see Figure 7 (b). The initial launch velocity has to be modiﬁed to take
this change into account so that the cloud apex remains at the required height. As
an aside, it should be noted that the ability to accelerate or decelerate a cloud could
have uses in a horizontal transport scheme as a means to modify the centre of mass
motion.

properties of the lens. Plot (b): The atomic cloud centre of mass’ vertical position
is plotted against time for a decelerating (red line) and an accelerating (black
line) axial-only lens. The magnetic pulse occurs at λ = 0.5. The decelerating
(accelerating) lens requires a faster (slower) launch velocity and the ﬂight time is
shorter (longer).

p

As expected when a0 = 0 these return to the free-ﬂight launch velocity vzi = √2gh
and apex time T =
2h/g. Ensuring that the focus occurs at the same time as the
cloud’s apex is non-trivial. The pulse length is calculated based upon knowledge of the
required focus time, see equation (15). But the focus time depends upon the location,
duration and strength of the magnetic pulse. Solving the problem requires iteration.
A further complication arises in the case of a decelerating lens due to the fact that
the vertical launch velocity, vzi, can become complex for some t1 and τ values. The
physical situation that corresponds to this case is where the desired apex height has
been reached before the pulse has ﬁnished. One ﬁnds that this limits the maximum
λ that can be used. The situation is worse for larger radius lenses as these require
longer pulse durations to achieve focusing. The accelerating lens does not suﬀer from
this kind of upper bound on λ.

With the radial conﬁnement being provided by the laser ﬁeld, focusing is only
required in the axial direction, hence the investigation becomes 1-dimensional. The
quality of the focus was investigated, and Figure 8 plots the change in axial standard
deviation, σz/σzi, against time for diﬀerent values of λ. There is no λ = 0.7 line
for the decelerating lens for the reason explained in the previous paragraph. Neither
lens causes magnetic pulse losses from the laser guide. For both decelerating and
accelerating 5 cm lenses the minimum cloud size is achieved for λ = 0.5, resulting
in a change in axial standard deviation of 1.18 and 1.64 respectively. If the lenses
were free of aberrations, one would expect to see no change in axial size at the focus
(i.e. σz/σzi = 1). An unfocused cloud’s axial size would have increased by a factor
of 34 and 59 respectively. The aberrations of the axial-only lens inhibit achieving a
compressed image.

0.7 (blue). The radial conﬁnement was provided by a 19 W laser guide with a
beam waist of 250 µm. The vertical lines indicate the predicted focus times - the
colours matching the corresponding line.

4.2. Axial focusing/radial defocusing lenses

The eﬀect of signiﬁcant aberrations and the complication of the constant acceleration
for axial-only lenses are undesired. These can be avoided by allowing the radial
direction to be perturbed with either the SFS or WFS lenses described in Section 3.2.2.
The combined potential resulting from the magnetic and laser ﬁelds is shown in
Figure 9 (a). At the centre, the optical dipole potential dominates and there is
positive curvature causing focusing in all three spatial directions. However, away
from the z-axis the magnetic potential becomes signiﬁcant and the radial curvature
turns negative. This turn over is shown more clearly in the z = 0 cross section in
Figure 9 (b). The trap depth has been reduced, which means some atoms will have
become energetically unbound during the lens pulse, see equation (5).

In Figure 10 the trajectories of 25 atoms are plotted in the centre of mass frame
for (a) the radial direction and (b) the axial direction. In this example a 5 cm WFS
lens was positioned at λ = 0.5 and was pulsed on for 5.5 ms to bring the cloud to a
focus at the fountain apex. In this simulation two atoms were lost as a result of the
magnetic lens pulse. Before investigating the quality of the focused cloud, attention
is turned to characterising these pulse losses.

Figure 10. The trajectories of 25 atoms are simulated passing through the laser
guide and being focused by a 5 cm radius WFS lens. The pulse occurs at λ = 0.5
and has a duration of 5.5 ms. Plot (a) shows the x-axis position and plot (b) the
z-axis position relative to the cloud’s centre of mass.

If an atom’s velocity was not modiﬁed, the ‘window of opportunity’ to escape only
lasts as long as the pulse time, which is usually of the order of a few milliseconds. This
escape time is short compared to the radial oscillation period within the laser guide.
The period is obtained from equation (4): Tosc = 2π/ωrL. For a 19 W laser with 1/e2
radius of 250 µm this corresponds to a period of 14 ms. Therefore an individual atom
1/10 th of an oscillation and is unlikely to escape. One would
will only perform
expect the loss due to this mechanism to scale with the pulse duration τ . However,
the magnetic pulse modiﬁes the velocity of the atoms. For some atoms this can result
in them becoming energetically unbound both during and after the pulse. Over time
these unbound atoms will escape from the guide. The loss due to the magnetic pulse
was measured to be
2%, and is tiny compared with the loss associated in the initial
loading of the laser guide.

∼

We now address the focusing properties of the SFS and WFS magnetic lenses.
For small radius lenses, aberrations tend to dominate resulting in a poor focus and
unpredictable focus time. When the lens radius is increased above 5 cm for a WFS
lens (S = 2.63) and above 7 cm for a SFS lens (S = 0.58), no further improvements are
observed. The S = 0.58 lens suﬀers from worse aberrations as the atoms experience
more of the anharmonic B-ﬁeld due to their closer proximity to the coils.

In Figure 11 the change in axial standard deviation, σz/σzi , for a 5 cm WFS lens
is plotted against time for diﬀerent values of λ. The eﬀect of aberrations is signiﬁcantly
less for this design compared with an axial-only lens. The minima are only slightly
worse than values achievable with an aberration-free lens. For the case of λ = 0.7 the
cloud is compressed along the axial direction to half of its initial size. Unlike previous
work where aberrations dominate a similar plot at high λ (see Figure 6 in ref. [13]), we
ﬁnd that for laser guided atoms this is not the case. This is due to the strong radial

4.3. Transported cloud properties

Numerical simulations were performed to compare diﬀerent transportation schemes.
The position and velocity standard deviations of the atomic cloud were computed after
tracing the trajectories of individual atoms. The results are presented in Table 2. For
, corresponding to a given velocity
ease of comparison the equivalent temperature,
and the cloud aspect ratio, ξ = σz/σr, are also tabulated. It should be noted that
when the cloud is trapped in the upper chamber, the temperature will rethermalise
via collisions. The trap geometry will determine the rethermalised temperature.

5. Discussion and conclusion

5.1. Lens comparison

The performances of the diﬀerent lenses are encapsulated in Table 2. The ﬁrst column
shows the properties of the initial MOT. The second gives the properties of that atoms
loaded into the guide. As expected these have a smaller radial extent, and as only
the least energetic are loaded, a lower radial temperature. For the launched atoms
with only laser guiding (third column) there is a slight increase in the radial size as
a consequence of the laser beam diﬀracting, and the axial size grows by more than
an order of magnitude. The cloud has a very elongated sausage shape (ξ >> 1).
Focusing the laser guided cloud with either a decelerating or an accelerating axial-
only lens (columns four and ﬁve respectively) produces a radial extent similar to an
unfocused laser guided cloud, however the axial extent is signiﬁcantly smaller than
with no magnetic lens, but not as compact as the original launched cloud. This is a
consequence of the aberrations associated with this lens design. The last two columns
characterise the performance of optimised SFS and WFS lenses. Although there is a

Table 2.
The table records the change in the atomic cloud’s properties
(position standard deviation σ, aspect ratio ξ, velocity standard deviation σv
and temperature T ) for diﬀerent transportation schemes. The columns are as
follows: the initial cloud properties generated in the MOT; the cloud loaded from
the MOT into a 250 µm beam waist laser guide; a cloud that has been transported
within the laser guide to the 22 cm apex; a guided cloud that has been focused
by a decelerating axial-only lens; a guided cloud that has been focused by an
accelerating axial-only lens;a guided cloud that has been axially focused by a SFS
lens; a guided cloud that has been axially focused by a WFS lens. Each lens has
a radius of 5 cm, a maximum current of N I = 10, 000 Amps and is pulsed on at
λ = 0.5, see Table 1.

slight atom loss during the impulse associated with the negative radial curvature, the
performance of these lenses is far superior, yielding moderately larger radial clouds,
and one-to-one axial imaging. In all cases the slight increase of the radial extent is
accompanied by a concomitant reduction of the radial temperature, a manifestation
of Liouville’s theorem.

Whilst initially it appears as if axial-only lenses would complement the radial
laser guiding, the results of the simulations shows that the best strategy would be
to use optimised harmonic WFS or SFS lenses. The axial-only lens is harder to
realise experimentally, and, as a consequence of the broken axial symmetry, has more
signiﬁcant aberrations. However, it can be used without further atom loss during
the magnetic impulse. By contrast the optimised harmonic SFS and WFS lenses do
suﬀer a slight atom loss during the pulse. However this is insigniﬁcant compared to
the initial loading loss. The axial-focusing of these two lenses is superior, and the
simulations show that for realistic experimental parameters better than one-to-one
axial focusing could be achieved when λ > 0.5.

There is a slight broadening of the cloud radially, arising from the laser beam’s

that the centre of mass of the atom cloud is always conﬁned by the tightest focus of
the beam. This would keep the initial cloud conﬁned to the same ﬁnal radial width.
However this would be at the expense of signiﬁcant experimental complexity.

5.2. The ‘ultimate’ density

An important feature of any new technique is to determine how much of an
improvement can be achieved. We now compare the maximum density increase that
can be achieved using either a dipole guide alone or a combination of a magnetic lens
and an identical dipole guide. The maximum density increase during guiding will be
approximately the fraction of atoms guided times the decrease in cloud volume (i.e.
the square of the radial decrease in cloud size times the axial decrease in cloud size).

Transport of launched cold atoms with a laser guide and pulsed magnetic ﬁelds

17

To maximise the guided atom fraction we need to choose the dipole waist at the
MOT (z = 0 cm) near the range w = 175
360 µm (from Sec. 2.3). To maximise the
−
radial compression of the MOT we try to minimise the waist at the apex (z = 22 cm)
compared to the waist at the MOT (z = 0 cm). Two sensible strategies are: (a) the
guide beam waist w0 = 193 µm at z0 = 11 cm a Rayleigh range from both the apex
and MOT (w = √2w0 = 273 µm at z = 0, 22 cm); (b) the beam waist w0 = 273 µm
at the apex z0 = 22 cm, a Rayleigh range from the MOT (w = √2w0 = 386 µm at
z = 0 cm). There is only a 10% diﬀerence in ﬁnal density between the methods and
we chose the option with higher ﬁnal density (b) as the larger radial compression
outweighs the higher loading loss.

We have chosen a SFS lens with S =

0.595, instead of S = 0.58,
as guided atoms have only a small amount of radial expansion and one can therefore
concentrate on minimising the axial anharmonicities in the lens potential [13]. The
maximum value of λ and hence the smallest axial focus that can be achieved using
a pulse of duration τ from a lens with angular frequency ω during the total atomic
guiding time T is the solution of the nonlinear expression: ω(τmax −
T ) = tan ωτmax
[13]. For S = 0.595 using the coil radius 5 cm and current 10, 000 A from Table 1,
we have ω = 97.5 rad s−1 and τmax = 16.6 ms which leads to an eﬀective focal time
λ = 0.950 and thus an axial magniﬁcation of

1/19.5 for a purely harmonic lens.

We have made movies to compare the phase space dynamics of a dipole guide alone
(left images in movies) and a dipole guide combined with an S = 0.595 maximum
duration (t = T
t = T ) magnetic lens (right images in movies). Phase-
space movies in rvr, rz, zvz and vrvz are available. The rvr movie shows how the
magnetic lens almost exclusively removes the funnelled atoms with E > 0. A dramatic
diﬀerence in ﬁnal atomic density at the apex of the atomic motion is seen in the rz
movie. The aberrations in the magnetic lens are illustrated by the ‘Z’ shaped zvz focus
(the horizontal bars of the ‘Z’ are the high axial velocity atoms which experience the
anharmonic regions of the magnetic lens). The concomitant increase in axial velocity
with an increase in axial density [14] is illustrated in the zvz and vrvz movies.

5.3. Conclusions

In summary, we have analysed the loading and guiding of a fountain of vertically
launched atoms by a far detuned laser beam. Although the optical dipole force

provides strong radial conﬁnement, the axial width of the cloud grows by more than
a order of magnitude. A hybrid approach using the optical dipole force for radial
conﬁnement and the Stern-Gerlach force for pulsed axial focusing was analysed, and
found to yield total density increases of an order of magnitude - almost three orders
of magnitude greater than by a dipole guide alone.

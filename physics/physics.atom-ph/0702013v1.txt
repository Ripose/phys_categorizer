We study the performance and limitations of a coherent interface between collective atomic states
and single photons. A quantized spin-wave excitation of an atomic sample inside an optical resonator
is prepared probabilistically, stored, and adiabatically converted on demand into a sub-Poissonian
photonic excitation of the resonator mode. The measured peak single-quantum conversion eﬃciency
of χ=0.84(11) and its dependence on various parameters are well described by a simple model of
the mode geometry and multilevel atomic structure, pointing the way towards implementing high-
performance stationary single-photon sources.

A quantum-coherent interface between light and a ma-
terial structure that can store quantum states is a pivotal
part of a system for processing quantum information [1].
In particular, a quantum memory that can be mapped
onto photon number states in a single spatio-temporal
mode could pave the way towards extended quantum
networks [2, 3] and all-optical quantum computing [4].
While light with sub-Poissonian ﬂuctuations can be gen-
erated by a variety of single-quantum systems [5, 6, 7],
a point emitter in free space is only weakly, and thus
irreversibly, coupled to an electromagnetic continuum.

To achieve reversible coupling, the strength of the
emitter-light interaction can be enhanced by means of
an optical resonator, as demonstrated for quantum dots
in the weak- [8, 9], trapped ions in the intermediate- [10],
and neutral atoms in the strong-coupling regime [11, 12].
By controlling the position of a single atom trapped in-
side a very-high-ﬁnesse resonator, McKeever et al. have
realized a high-quality deterministic single-photon source
[12]. This source operates in principle in the reversible-
coupling regime, although ﬁnite mirror losses presently
make it diﬃcult to obtain full reversibility in practice.

Alternatively, superradiant states of an atomic ensem-
ble [13] exhibit enhanced coupling to a single electromag-
netic mode. For three-level atoms with two stable ground
states these collective states can be viewed as quantized
spin waves, where a spin-wave quantum (magnon) can be
converted into a photon by the application of a phase-
matched laser beam [3]. Such systems have been used
to generate [14, 16], store and retrieve single photons
[18, 19], to generate simultaneous-photon pairs [17, 25],
and to increase the single-photon production rate by feed-
back [21, 22, 23]. The strong-coupling regime between
magnons and photons can be reached if the sample’s op-
tical depth OD exceeds unity. However, since the failure
rate for magnon-photon conversion in these free-space
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] or moderate-ﬁnesse-
cavity [24, 25] systems has been around 50% or higher,
which can be realized with OD ≤ 1, none of the ensemble
systems so far has reached the strong, reversible-coupling
regime.

tons using a sample of laser-cooled Cs atoms inside an optical
resonator.
(b) Level scheme for the system with hyperﬁne
and magnetic sublevels |F, mF i. The atomic sample is ini-
tially prepared in |gi by optical pumping.

In this Letter, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the
strong-coupling regime between collective spin-wave ex-
citations and a single electromagnetic mode. This is
evidenced by heralded single-photon generation with a
single-quantum conversion eﬃciency of χ = 0.84(11), at a
seven-fold suppression of two-photon events. The atomic
memory exhibits two Doppler lifetimes, τs = 230 ns
and τl=23 µs, that are associated with diﬀerent magnon
wavelengths λs=0.4 µm and λl=23 µm written into the
sample.

Our apparatus consists of a 6.6 cm long, standing-
wave optical resonator with a TEM00 waist wc=110µm,
ﬁnesse F =93(2), linewidth κ/(2π)=24.4(5) MHz , and
free spectral range ∆ν=2.27 GHz. The mirror trans-
missions M1, M2 and round-trip loss L near the cesium
D2 line wavelength λ=2π/k=852 nm are M1=1.18(2)%,
M2=0.039(2)%, and L=5.5(1)%, respectively, such that a
photon escapes from the resonator in the preferred direc-
tion with a probability of T =0.175(4). The light exiting
from the cavity is polarization-analyzed, and delivered
via a single-mode optical ﬁber to a photon counting mod-
ule. The overall detection probability for a photon pre-
pared inside the resonator is q=T q1q2q3=2.7(3)%, which

includes photodiode quantum eﬃciency q1=0.40(4), in-
terference ﬁlter transmission q2=0.609(2), and ﬁber cou-
pling and other optical losses q3=0.65(4). The large cav-
ity losses in our system arise from Cs deposition. For
the conditional autocorrelation measurement described
at the end of the paper, we cleaned the mirrors. This
decreased our losses to L=0.30(15)%, increased the cav-
ity ﬁnesse to F =420(40) and the escape probability to
T =0.78(8), and improved our overall detection probabil-
ity to q=20(3)%.

An ensemble containing between 103 and 106 laser-
cooled 133Cs atoms is prepared along the cavity axis,
corresponding to an adjustable optical depth between
N η=0.1 and N η=200. Here η = η0 |cr|2 is the single-
atom optical depth (cooperativity parameter) for the
read transition with reduced dipole matrix element
cr=3/4 (see Fig. 1b), η0 = 24F/(πk2w2
c ) is the opti-
cal depth for an atom located at a cavity antinode on a
transition with unity matrix element, and N is the ef-
fective number of atoms at this location that produces
the same optical depth as the extended sample. The
single-atom, single-photon Rabi frequency 2g is given by
η = 4g2/(κΓ), where Γ=2π × 5.2 MHz and κ are the
atomic and cavity full linewidths, respectively.

Starting with a magneto-optical trap (MOT), we turn
oﬀ the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld, apply a 1.8 G bias
ﬁeld perpendicular to the resonator, and optically pump
the atoms into a single hyperﬁne and magnetic sublevel
|gi with two laser beams propagating along the magnetic
ﬁeld direction. The relevant atomic levels are the elec-
6S1/2; F = 3, mF = 3(cid:11), |f i =
tronic ground states |gi = (cid:12)

beams, derived from independent, frequency-stabilized
lasers, have a waist size wp=300 µm, enclose a small an-
gle θ ≈ 2◦ with the cavity axis, and are linearly polar-
ized along the bias ﬁeld (Fig. 1a). The write pump is
applied for 60 ns with a detuning of ∆w/(2π) = −40MHz
from the |gi → |ei transition at a typical intensity of 70
mW/cm2. With some small probability a “write” photon
is generated inside the resonator by spontaneous Raman
scattering on the |gi → |ei → |f i transition to which a
resonator TEM00 mode is tuned [3, 24]. At some later
time, the quantized spin wave generated in the write pro-
cess is strongly (superradiantly) coupled to the cavity
if the Raman emission |f i → |di → |gi from a phase-
matched read pump beam restores the sample’s initial
momentum distribution [3, 13, 24]. The read pump is
ramped on in 100 ns, with a peak intensity of up to 7
W/cm2. It is detuned by ∆r/(2π)=60 MHz relative to
the |f i → |di transition, such that the “read” photon is
emitted into another TEM00 resonator mode. The write-
read process is repeated for 2 ms (up to 800 times) per
MOT cycle of 100 ms.

As the conversion eﬃciency χ of a single stored magnon
into a photon in the cavity approaches unity, small frac-
tional uncertainties in χ result in large uncertainties in
the failure rate 1 − χ. However, the interesting physics

of entangled atomic states coupling to photons that rules
the matter-light interface hinges on understanding the
failure rate. Thus, we explore how to accurately esti-
mate χ by studying the directly measurable conditional
retrieval eﬃciency Rc = (hnwnri − hnwihnri)/hnwi, and
unconditional retrieval eﬃciency Ru = hnri/hnwi. Here
nw and nr are the write and read photon numbers in a
given time interval, respectively, referenced to within the
resonator. Note that neither measure Rc, Ru is a priori
an accurate estimator of the single-quantum conversion
eﬃciency χ. The conditional quantity Rc is insensitive
to read backgrounds, but requires accurate calibration
of detection eﬃciency, and systematically diﬀers from χ
both at low and high hnwi [20]. Ru can be measured at
larger hnwi and provides better statistics since it does not
rely on correlated events, but is sensitive to read back-
grounds which must be independently measured, e.g., by
breaking the phase-matching condition [24].

Fig. 2 shows the conditional and unconditional re-
trieval eﬃciencies Rc, Ru versus average write photon
number hnwi inside the lower-ﬁnesse resonator at ﬁxed
optical depth N η=10. A carefully calibrated 17(4)%
correction due to detector afterpulsing has been applied
to Rc. The rise in Ru at small hnwi is due to read
backgrounds, while the drop in Rc is due to write back-
grounds, that are not accompanied by a spin wave. The
increase of Rc with hnwi is due to double excitations.
An accurate value for the single-quantum conversion ef-
ﬁciency χ can be extracted from the measured data by
means of a model that includes uncorrelated constant
write and read backgrounds, independently measured to
be bw = 0.0028(4) and br = 0.0074(9) when referenced to

FIG. 3: Magnon-photon conversion eﬃciency χ versus read
optical depth N η, at a write-read delay of 120 ns. The op-
tical depth is extracted from the write scattering rate and
known intensities and detunings. The dashed line shows the
predicted conversion χ0 for a three-level system, the solid line
is the prediction from a model including dephasing from ad-
ditional excited states.

FIG. 4: Conditional single-photon conversion eﬃciency χ ver-
sus the delay time between write and read pulses τ . The two
time scales, as apparent in the inset, are due to the super-
position of a short- and a long-wavelength magnon in the

the cavity. This model predicts hnwiRu = χ(hnwi−bw)+
br and hnwiRc = χ(hnwi − bw)[1 + (gww − 1)(hnwi − bw)].
The measured write second-order autocorrelation func-
tion gmeas
ww = 2.4(2) diﬀers from the expected value
gww = 2, likely due to observed ﬂuctuations in write
pulse intensity. A ﬁt of Rc, Ru to the model, with the
conversion χ as the only ﬁtting parameter, yields a good
match between data and model, and good agreement be-
tween the value χc = 0.84(11) extracted from the con-
ditional and the value χu = 0.85(2) extracted from the
unconditional retrieval eﬃciency. χu, being independent
of detection eﬃciency, is more precise. Since bw, br ≪ 1,
the magnon-photon conversion χ can also be estimated as
the y intercept of the linear ﬁt Rc = χ(1+(gww −1)hnwi).
The inset to Fig. 2 shows the write-read cross correlation
gwr = hnwnri/(hnwihnri) versus hnwi, as well as the pre-
dicted dependence with no free parameters. In the region
hnwi > 0.05, where gwr approaches its fundamental limit
gwr ≤ 1/hnwi, backgrounds are negligible, and the un-
conditional recovery Ru is also a good estimate of χ. In
the ﬁgures which follow, we estimate χ as Rc/(1 + hnwi),
and use it to examine the physical limitations on the
magnon-photon interface.

The most fundamental limit on the conversion process
χ0 = N η/(N η + 1) arises from the competition between
the sample’s collective coupling to the cavity mode, and
single-atom emission into free space. In the oﬀ-resonant
(collective-scattering) regime this limit originates from
the collective enhancement of the read rate by a factor
N η relative to the single-atom free-space scattering rate
[24].
In the on-resonance (dark-state rotation) regime
[3, 11, 12] the limit χ0 is due to the stronger suppression
of free-space scattering (by a factor (N η)−2) compared
to the suppression of cavity emission (factor (N η)−1). In
either case, large optical depth is key to a good interface.

To the extent that the atomic system is not a simple
three-level system, additional sources of magnon decoher-
ence, such as non-resonant scattering from other excited
states, reduce the conversion eﬃciency. More relevant in
the present case are spatially inhomogeneous light shifts
due to other excited states that decrease linearly, rather
than quadratically, with the excited-state energy split-
tings. Such light shifts dephase the spin grating, and re-
duce the magnon-photon conversion by χls = (1 − 2s4φ2
r)
to lowest order in the ratio s = wc/wp ≪ 1. Here φr is
the average light-shift-induced phase accumulated by an
atom on the pump beam axis during the read process,
and wc (wp) is the cavity (read pump) waist. Note that
χls depends upon read pump size wp, but not the read
pump intensity Ir, since both light shift and read rate
are proportional to Ir. As such, as the pump waist is in-
creased at ﬁxed read intensity, the resulting failure rate
should decrease as the inverse square of the pump power.
Fig. 3 shows that this dephasing eﬀect dramatically
changes the dependence of the conversion eﬃciency on
optical depth N η. While the conversion eﬃciency χ0
for a three-level-atom approaches unity for large opti-
cal depth N η (dashed line), the increase in read-photon
emission time in the dark-state rotation regime (by a fac-
tor N η) for atoms with multiple excited states increases
the dephasing χls, and reduces the conversion. The pre-
dicted conversion χ0χls including all atomic excited hy-
perﬁne states produces the correct functional form, as
well as the position and peak value of the recovery eﬃ-
ciency, at a waist ratio of s−1=wp/wc=3, in good agree-
ment with the measured value of 3.0(4).

The prediction in Fig. 3 also includes a small con-
version reduction due to the decoherence of the magnon
caused by the atoms’ thermal motion during the 120
ns storage time. For the small angle θ ≈ 2◦ between
running-wave pump beams and cavity standing wave, the
write photon emission process creates a superposition of

4

two spin waves of very diﬀerent wavelengths. Backward
emission corresponds to a short wavelength λs ≈ λ/2 =
0.4 µm, and is highly Doppler-sensitive, while forward
emission with λl = λ/(2 sin(θ/2)) = 23 µm is nearly
Doppler free. The recovery versus storage time τ at
N η = 10 (Fig. 4) shows the two corresponding Gaus-
sian time constants τs = 240 ns and τl = 23 µs.

The long-time conversion is limited to 25%, because
each individual spin-wave component alone can only be
recovered with 50% probability due to the mismatch be-
tween the standing wave cavity mode and the running-
wave magnon. The highest observed conversion eﬃciency
in Fig.
4 of χ=0.95(13) is higher than for the inset
or Fig. 2. The data for Fig. 4 was taken after care-
fully realigning the bias magnetic ﬁeld along the quan-
tization axis deﬁned by the pump beam polarizations,
while the inset and Fig. 2 were taken before realign-
ment. This suggests that spin precession due to imperfect
magnetic ﬁeld alignment could also reduce the conversion
eﬃciency. The result χ=0.95 was obtained for a single
write-photon value hnwi=0.27(3), so we conservatively
quote χ=0.84 obtained from the ﬁt to the data versus
nw with un-optimized ﬁelds in Fig. 2.

Using the lower loss (F =420) cavity with clean mirrors
to minimize sensitivity to detector afterpulsing and im-
prove the data collection rate, we measure the read auto-
correlation function grr|w conditioned on having detected
a write photon. Due to the seven times higher detection
eﬃciency, the detector dark count rate does not appre-
ciably lower the recovery down to nw = 0.005 in this

conﬁguration. For hnwi=0.007 we obtain grr|w=0.15(8)
at an optical depth N η=10, clearly demonstrating the
sub-Poissonian nature of the source.

In summary, we have realized an interface between
spin-wave quanta and narrowband single photons with
a performance near 90%, representing the ﬁrst experi-
mental demonstration of strong coupling between collec-
tive spin-wave excitations and photons. Several proposed
mechanisms appear to adequately explain the remaining
failure rate of the magnon-photon interface, and indi-
cate the path to future improvements. If the conditional
single-photon source described here were operated as a
single-trial source by applying the read beam only when
a write photon was detected, it already would have al-
most comparable performance to recently demonstrated
feedback-enhanced sources [21, 22, 23]: at nw = 0.007
our source would unconditionally deliver photons with
probability 0.6% at grr = 0.15, to be compared to 5.4%
at grr = 0.41 for 150 trials [21], or 2.5% at grr = 0.3 [23]
for 12 trials. It should be straightforward to implement
feedback as demonstrated in Refs.
[21, 22, 23] into our
setup. If the Doppler eﬀect can be eliminated by conﬁn-
ing the atoms in a far-detuned optical lattice, the result-
ing substantial increase in magnon storage time would
allow the 150 trials necessary to implement an uncondi-
tional source with near-unity single-photon probability.

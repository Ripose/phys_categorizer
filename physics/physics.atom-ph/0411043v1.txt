Abstract

This work is aimed at the multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock calculations of the 6s ioniza-
tion energies of lanthanides with conﬁgurations [Xe]4f N 6s2. Authors have used the ATSP
MCHF version in which there are new codes for calculation of spin-angular parts of matrix
elements of the operators of intraatomic interactions written on the basis of the method-
ology Gaigalas, Rudzikas and Froese Fischer, based on the second quantization in coupled
tensorial form, the angular momentum theory in 3 spaces (orbital, spin and quasispin),
graphical technique of spin-angular integrations and reduced coeﬃcients (subcoeﬃcients)
of fractional parentage. This methodology allows us to study the conﬁgurations with open
f –shells without any restrictions, thus providing the possibility to investigate heavy atoms
and ions as well as to obtain reasonably accurate values of spectroscopic data for such
complex many-electron systems.

Introduction

There is a considerable interest in understanding the physics and chemistry of heavy atoms
and ions. The main problem in the investigation of such systems is their complexity, caused
by a large number of electrons and the importance of both the correlation and relativistic
eﬀects. Therefore an accurate description of heavy atoms and ions requires generaly the correct
treatment of the correlation as well as the relativistic eﬀects. There are a number of approaches
developed for this purpose: conﬁguration interaction (CI) [1] and multi-conﬁguration methods
such as multi-conﬁguration Hartree–Fock (MCHF) [2], Dirac–Fock (MCDF) methods, many
body perturbation theory (MBPT) [3], etc. However the domains of their applicability are very
diﬀerent. Some of these methods so far may be applied only for atoms and ions having closed
electronic shells or one electron above closed shells.

Relativistic nature of motion implies the use of relativistic wave functions and relativistic
Hamiltonian [1]. However a complete and rigorous treatment of the correlation eﬀects together
with the relativistic nature of the motion for heavy atoms and ions is, unfortunately, practically
outside of today’s computation possibilities.

Fortunately, there exists a fairly large variety of atoms and their ionisation degrees, for which
the relativistic eﬀects are small compared to the non-spherical part of Coulomb interactions
and, therefore, may be accurately taken into account as corrections of the order α2 (α is the ﬁne
structure constant) in the Pauli approximation, considered in details in [1]. This is particulary
true for the spectroscopic properties and processes connected with the outer electronic shells
of an atom or ion. Also there are some spectroscopic quantities which are described as the
diﬀerence of two large numbers. The ionization energies belong to such category of quantities.
Relativistic eﬀects are most important for the electrons in inner shells. Latters practically
do not ”feel” the loss of the outer electron in the process of the ionization, therefore the
main relativistic eﬀects cancel each other while calculating ionization energies. This supports
the use of the approach described in this paper. Moreover, analysis of the energy spectra
of atoms considered clearly shows that the ﬁne structure of the terms is really ”ﬁne”, there
are even no traces of splitting of a shell f N into relativistic subshells f N1
+ , typical for
relativistic approach. All this gives us the conﬁdence that the main attention, while studying
the ionization energies, must be paid to eﬃcient accounting for correlation eﬀects.

Thus, this paper is supposed to show that some properties (such as ionization energies of
valence electrons) of heavy atoms can be quite accurately determined using the nonrelativistic
wave functions, accounting for correlation eﬀects by the MCHF method and for relativistic
eﬀects as corrections of the order α2.
In addition in the paper we discribe the method of
selection of the basis for the accurate accounting of the correlation eﬀects important for the
property under consideration, namely, the determination of the 6s ionization energies (IE) of
the lanthanides.

The authors were able to ﬁnd only one consistent and rigorous study of lanthanides ionization
energies [5], including the correlation eﬀects, performed using ab initio methods. In the study
[5] the CI method with Gaussian-type functions was used. This approach is typically used in
molecular physics. The authors suppose that it is relevant to study the ionization energies of
lanthanides using the accurate methods common in atomic physics.

The problem in both CI and MCHF methods is to ﬁnd the bases of atomic functions satisfying

3

two conditions: one is to obtain accurate data and the other is to be manageable by today’s
computation possibilities. The right choice of the basis would allow us not only to reproduce
the ionization energies and other atomic data by ab initio methods, but it would also lead us
to a better understanding of the importance and structure of the correlation and relativistic
eﬀects.

For this purpose we perform MCHF calculations using the multi–conﬁguartion Hartree–Fock
code from the atomic–structure package (ATSP MCHF) [2, 6] in which there are new codes
for calculation of spin-angular parts of matrix elements of the operators of intraatomic inter-
actions written on the basis of the methodology Gaigalas, Rudzikas and Froese Fischer [7, 8],
based on the second quantization in coupled tensorial form, the angular momentum theory in
three spaces (orbital, spin and quasispin), graphical technique of spin-angular integrations and
reduced coeﬃcients (subcoeﬃcients) of fractional parentage. The tables of such coeﬃcients
are presented in [8]. They allow us the study of conﬁgurations with open f -shells without any
restrictions. The basic concepts of our approach are presented in Section 2.

We assume that in case of lanthanides with conﬁgurations [Xe]4f N 6s2 the relativistic and
correlation eﬀects between the electrons of ”inner shells” (core-core correlations) are the same
for the neutral atom and ion and then these eﬀects (corresponding energies) cancel each other
in calculation of ionization energy (EI ). Mean distance to the nucleus of ”outer” electrons
(calculated for example by single-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (HF) method [9, 10] ) is much
larger than that of ”inner” electrons. Therefore we expect that the correlations between ”inner”
and ”outer” electrons (core-valence correlations) will be negligible. For the same reason we
expect relativistic eﬀects for ”outer shells” to be not so much important as for ”inner shells”
(mean value of electron velocity is proportional to the -1 power of mean distance to the
nucleus) and they can be treated rather accurately by adding relativistic corrections to the
non-relativistic Hamiltonian. Then it may be possible to get quite accurate values of the
ionization energies by MCHF approach and accounting for relativistic eﬀects as corrections.

Section 3 is aimed at checking this assumption.
In Section 4 we present our ﬁnal results.
The results are compared with the previous theoretical investigations [5] and with values of IE
compiled from experimental data [11, 12, 13, 14]. The details of the experimental investigation
of the ionization energies of lanthanides can be found in [15, 16, 17]. Section 5 serves for
conclusions.

2 Approach

We deﬁne the ionization energy as EI = Eion − Eg, where Eg and Eion are the ground state
energies of neutral and singly ionized atoms correspondingly. The ground state of a neutral
lanthanide atom is

1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p64d105s25p64f N 6s2 ≡ [Xe]4f N 6s2

and that of singly ionized one

1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p64d105s25p64f N 6s1 ≡ [Xe]4f N 6s1.

Here N corresponds to 3, ..., 7 for P r, ..., Eu and to 9, ..., 14 for T b, ..., Y b.

The expressions (4-7) are presented in atomic units.

We expect the operator (3) to enable us to take into account the main relativistic corrections
to ionization energy.

For the calculation of ionization energy we used MCHF method. In this approach, the atomic
state function Ψ(γLS) is expressed as a linear combination of conﬁguration state functions
(CSFs) Φ(γiLS), i.e.

Ψ(γLS) =

ciΦ(γiLS).

A set of orbitals, or an active set (AS), determines the set of all possible CSFs or the complete
active space (CAS) for MCHF calculation. The size of the latter grows rapidly with a number
of electrons and also with the size of the orbital AS. Most MCHF expansions are therefore
limited to a restricted active space (RAS) [2]. The RAS is spanned by all CSFs that can be
generated from a given active set, of orbitals, with some constrains. The constrains are derived
from the notions of diﬀerent types of correlations discussed below. No ”relaxation” eﬀects were
included.

For complex atoms and ions, a considerable part of the eﬀort must be devoted to integrations
over spin–angular variables, occurring in the matrix elements of the operators under consid-
eration. In the papers [1, 7, 18], an eﬃcient approach for ﬁnding matrix elements of any one–

extensive exploitation of the symmetry properties of the quantities of the theory of complex
atomic spectra, presented in the secondly quantized form, in orbital, spin and quasispin spaces.
It is free of shortcomings of previous approaches. This approach allows one to generate fairly
accurate databases of atomic parameters [19, 20] and will be used in our paper.

According to the approach by [7, 18], a general expression of submatrix element for any scalar
two–particle operator between functions with u open shells, valid for both non–relativistic and
relativistic wave functions, can be written down as follows:

The abovementioned method of the deﬁnition of spin–angular parts becomes especially im-
portant in the investigation of the complex systems in both relativistic and nonrelativistic
approaches.

The usage of MCHF as well as MCDF methods gives accurate results only when the RAS is
formed properly. Therefore the next chapter is dedicated to the analysis of this problem.

3 RAS construction

Large scale systematic MCHF calculations (except for Er [10] and Gd [9]) of EI of lanthanides
have not been done yet. Therefore, following the methodology of [2], it is important to in-
vestigate the structure of ground conﬁgurations, to impose the core and valence shells and to
evaluate valence–valence (VV), core–valence (CV) and core–core (CC) correlations.

It is always a question when we can assume that a shell is a part of the core, and when it should
be treated as a valence shell. The answer is not trivial even for boron like ions, and in our case
it is even more complicated because of the complexity of conﬁgurations under consideration.
Our purpose is to take care of the correlation eﬀects that do not cancel each other between
ion and atom.

In this chapter we will discuss some practical possibilities of RAS construction using an example
of Er [10].

3.1 Single-conﬁguration HF calculations

We can get the ﬁrst insight into the structure of Er and Er+ ground states from the single-
conﬁguration HF calculations. The resultant ground state energies and mean values of various
operators of nl radial functions are presented in Table I. Resultant energies are practically the
same as those presented in [21, 22].

The fact that the mean values of < r >, < r2 > operators are much higher and at the same
time the mean value of < 1/r > is much smaller for 6s function than those for 5s, 5p and 4f
functions shows that the 6s function is much more remote from the nucleus than the others.

Similar analysis shows that the open 4f shell is closer to the nucleus than 5s and 5p.

The same situation remains for the Er+ ion (corresponding values presented in brackets).
Therefore, we have a diﬃculty in treatment of ”outer” electrons: usually as outer (valence)
shells the open ones are considered, but sometimes the closed shells (6s2 in our case) are
included too [2]. For the light atoms these shells are spatially ”outer”.

The same qualitative picture is valid for other lanthanides considered.

It is interesting to notice that 2p and 3p, 3d electrons are spatially closer to the nucleous
than respectively 2s and 3s. This fact may be explained by the increasing role of relativistic
eﬀects for inner electrons in heavy atoms, which may need already proper account for so called
indirect relativistic eﬀects.

3.2 Core I

In this case we use the core

7

I. [Xe] 1S
and we treat 4f , 6s as valence shells. We treat 4f shell as a valence shell because it is open
and 6s - because the corresponding radial function is much more remote from the nucleus than
others. This approach is close to the advices given in [2].

The basis for the MCHF expansion was formed using the CSFs of the conﬁgurations made of
single and double (S, D) excitations from the valence shells to some destination set. There
were two types of destination sets used:

a = {5d, 5f, 5g, 6p, 6d} ,

b = a + {6f, 6g, 6h, 7s, 7p, 7d} .

(10)

(11)

Further on we denote the basis as a core with subscript of destination set. For example, Ia
denotes the basis, consisting of CSFs of the conﬁgurations, made by S, D excitations from
4f 126s2 for Er and 4f 126s1 for Er+ to the destination set ”a” and cores [Xe]. The numbers
of CSFs in the bases (NCSF) are presented in Table II.

The weight for the main CSF was found to be 0.977 for Ia (and similar for Ib). This value is
close to that (0.949) found by CI method [5]. The mean distances of radial functions from the
nucleus are found to be up to 2 % smaller than those for single-conﬁguration HF calculations.
For example, < r >4f = 0.752 a.u. for Ia (0.748 a.u. for Ib) and < r >6s = 4.550 a.u. for Ia
(4.534 a.u. for Ib).

3.3 Cores II, III

In this case, only 6s is treated as a valence shell, because of its spatial location. We expect
this strategy to be more eﬃcient for the calculations of 6s ionization energy because as we can
see from single-conﬁguration HF calculations the mean distance of 4f radial functions is not
much diﬀerent for Er and Er+. As the cores we use
II. [Xe]4f 12 with not ﬁxed term
and
III. [Xe]4f 12 with ﬁxed term 3H.
There were ﬁve types of destination sets used with these cores, namely,
(10) and (11) as for core I and three more

c = b + {7f, 7g, 7h, 7i, 8s, 8p, 8d} ,

d = c + {8f, 8g, 8h, 8i, 8k, 9s, 9p, 9d} ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

e = d + {9f, 9g, 9h, 9i, 9k, 9l, 10s, 10p, 10d} .

The results of MCHF calculations (Er and Er+ ground state energies and ionization energies)
are also presented in Table II. The weights of the main CSFs in MCHF expansions are between
0.960 – 0.980 for all bases with cores II, III. The mean distance from the nucleus for 6s radial
function is greater than the one obtained from single-conﬁguration HF calculations but smaller

8

than that obtained using the bases with core I. For example, < r >6s = 4.560 a.u. for IIIa,
4.564 a.u. for IIIb,d,e.

Here we would like to draw an attention to the fact that in order to accurately account for the
correlation eﬀects of some type (e.g. core-core or core-valence) the destination set should be
big enough. In the calculation of the ionization energy it is especially important to properly
accout for the correlation eﬀects of the same nature for an atom and ion. For example, the
destination sets a for the cores II and III are too small and therefore lead to the far from
true values in the ionization energy because the number of CFSs in the ions MCHF expansion
is too small. It becames particularly obvious in the case of IIIa for Ho for which the value
of ionization energy EI = 19.189 (see Table II) is far from the real one. But the increase
of the destination set up to the b already gives balanced inclusion of the correlation eﬀects
for an atom and ion and reasonable values of IE. The further increse of destination set gives
the convergence of the IE to the value deﬁned by the choice of the core, and the approach
(Hamiltonian).

3.4 Strategy of RAS formation

As we can see from Table II, the basis formed with the same destination sets is the biggest for
core I, the medium for core II and the smallest for core III. Correspondingly the energies
are the lowest for core I, the medium for core II and the highest for core II. This means
that the bases of core I account for more correlation eﬀects, than the ones of cores II and III.
Nevertheless the ionization energies obtained using cores II and III are practically the same,
and the ones obtained using core I are much worse. This is due to the fact that the basis
formed using the destination set ”b” for core I is not enough to account for the correlation
eﬀects of 4f electrons, which, represented in full, cancel between Er and Er+.

So, the most eﬃcient strategy is to use the MCHF expansions with a frozen core of the type
[Xe]4f N 2S+1L and single, double excitations from 6s. This strategy was used when forming
the bases for EI calculations of other lanthanides. Corresponding sizes of the bases are simillar
to the ones for Er. For example, the bases of the type similar to IIIe consisted of 3018 CSFs
for Pr, Nd, Dy, Ho, of 2938 CSFs for Pm, Tb and of 2240 CSFs for Sm, Tm.

6s ionization energy

4.1 Nonrelativistic

The nonrelativistic 6s ionization energies of atoms considered are presented in Table III. There
EI stands for a value of ionization energy calculated by MCHF method, Exp - experimental
results [14, 17]. For comparison we also present single-conﬁguration HF and CI [5] results.
We were not able to obtain the relevant result for Europium due to the problems with the
convergence of MCHF equations.

Fig. 1 shows Z dependence of ionization energies calculated by single-conﬁguration HF, CI,
MCHF methods and the experimental one.

The diﬀerences between the MCHF energies of the ground states and the ones obtained by
single-conﬁguration HF method (∆E) for all Z vary from 0.626 eV to 0.707 eV. Their absolute
value is smaller than that predicted in [5]. So, in general we encounter less correlation eﬀects

9

for the ground states. For example, for Er in [5] there is ∆E=-15.339 eV and our value is
∆E=-0.669 eV.

Nevertheless our computed values of ionization energies are closer to the experimental ones
than CI [5] (see the root-mean-square deviations σ of calculated results from experimental
measurements in Table III). For example, for Er in [5] there is 5.077 eV and our value is
5.792 eV whereas the experimental value is 6.108 eV [14, 17]. So, though we account for less
correlation eﬀects in general, however we get better value of ionization energy because we
account for more correlation eﬀects that do not cancel between the atom and the ion.

For the smaller Z the results of CI and MCHF calculations are quite close. For example, for
Pr (Z=59) the diﬀerence between CI and MCHF values is only 0.019 eV (i.e. less than 1%).
Meanwhile the MCHF results grow faster with the increasing Z and for large Z they are much
more closer to the experimental ones. For example, for Tm (Z=69) the diﬀerence between CI
and MCHF values of EI grows up to 0.982 eV (i.e. 16%).

Fig. 2 shows the Z dependence of the inﬂuence of correlation eﬀects ∆E on the EI calculated
by CI method with Davidson Q correction (CI+Q) [5] and by MCHF method. Davidson Q
correction is supposed to aproximately account for the higher order correlation eﬀects. We
deﬁne the inﬂuence as ∆EI = EI − EIHF , where EIHF stands for the value of ionization
energy calculated by single-conﬁguration HF method.

As we see in Fig. 2, the values of ∆EI calculated by MCHF and by CI+Q methods show
diﬀerent Z-behaviour. While CI+Q results tend to decrease with Z the MCHF ones increase.
We expect the increase of inﬂuence of correlation eﬀects with Z to be a real one because of
two reasons: the MCHF results are closer to the experimental ones and it is more realistic to
expect that with increasing number of electrons the inﬂuence of their correlation eﬀects grows
too.

4.2 With relativistic corrections

The 6s ionization energies calculated with various relativistic corrections are presented in
Table IV. There Ei
I stands for a value of ionization energy calculated by MCHF method
using nonrelativistic Hamiltonian with relativistic corrections Hi. Here i = 1, 2, 3 and H1 =
H1 + H3 + H′

5, H2 = H1 + Hmp, H3 = H2 + H2.

For comparison we also present ionization energies calculated using the Relativistic Hartree-
Fock method (RHF), the ones of CI with Davidson Q correction and estimated relativistic
corrections (CIEst) [5] (these values practically cannot be considered as ab initio) as well as
the experimental results [14, 17] (Exp).
3 and H′
Two–electron relativistic corrections H2, H′′
5 are generally of the same order of mag-
nitude, but their contribution may have diﬀerent signs, therefore they all must be taken into
account simultaneously. Therefore the results E3
I in Table IV must be considered as the most
correct, in spite of the fact that the data of the columns E1
I seem to be slightly closer
to the experimental ones. The point is that one–electron operators H1 and H′
3 have large
contributions but of opposite signs therefore are very sensitive to the accuracy of the wave
functions used.

The results of Table IV also suggest that accounting for relativistic eﬀects as relativistic cor-
rections of the order α2 usually improves the ionization energies of rare earths (compare with

10

EI column of Table III), but there may occur cases (for example Ho, Tm) where such an im-
provement worsens the ﬁnal result. Therefore taking into consideration the relativistic eﬀects
for heavy atoms having open f –shells requires further studies.

The results presented in the subsections 4.1 and 4.2 show that our values of ionization energies
are the closest to the experimental ones with respect to other ones obtained by pure ab initio
methods and in most cases are even better than the ones obtained by using semiempirical
corrections in spite of the fact that the RAS is formed in such a way that the coresponding
bases are relatively small. The results obtained allow to evaluate more precisely the inﬂuence
of correletion eﬀects to the ionization energies of the 6s electrons.

The results of 4.2 subsection show that the relativistic eﬀects accounted in the form of (3) in
MCHF approach are not appropriate for the elements Ho, Tm. The values of their ionization
energies with the corresponding corrections are bigger than experimental ones.

The strategy of RAS formation presented in subsection 3.4 gives a hint for the formation
of corresponding bases in relativistic approach too. The bases (IIIa – IIIe) presented in the
subsection 3.4 contain the minimum number of CSFs but the correlation eﬀects are adequately
accounted for an atom and ion. So such bases (but with the relativistic splitting of subshells)
should be used for the corresponding study by relativistic MCHF method as well.

5 Conclusion

The results obtained show that if the correlation eﬀects of inner shells cancel each other between
atom and ion, then it is possible to get quite accurate data on ionization energies by MCHF
method accounting for the correlation eﬀects of the outer electrons only. This assumption
takes place in the case of ionization energy of lanthanides with conﬁgurations [Xe]4f N 6s2.

Our results on 6s ionization energy of lanthanides with conﬁgurations [Xe]4f N 6s2 are more
accurate than the data found using the CI method [5].

The inﬂuence of the correlation efects on the ionization energy of lanthanides with conﬁgura-
tions [Xe]4f N 6s2 is higher than it has been found before [5] and this inﬂuence grows with Z
(with N). However, the convergency of the value studied to true one with the increase of the
basis is often not smooth. This statement is illustrated very well by the intermediate value of
EI for Ho 19.189 eV (basis IIIa in Table II).

The results presented demonstrate the ability of the approach by Gaigalas et al.
[1, 7, 8]
based on the second quantization in coupled tensorial form, the graphical technique of spin–
angular integration, quasispin formalism and reduced coeﬃcients (subcoeﬃcients) of fractional
parentage to obtain reasonably accurate data on the ionization energies of heavy atoms and
ions, having open f -shells.

Acounting for the relativistic eﬀects as the corrections of order α2 improves in general the
ionization energies. However, some inhomogeneities in their behaviour with respect to Z or N
indicate that it is necessary to reﬁne the value of 6s functions at nucleus, to accurately account
for the ﬁnite size of the nucleus or simply to use the relativistic wave functions.

In conclusion, the accurate studies of the structure and spectral properties of rare earth ele-
ments require further improvement of the accounting for both the correlation and relativistic

11

eﬀects, but some properties deﬁned by valence electrons may be successfully studied by non-
relativistic approach (MCHF method) accounting for relativistic eﬀects as corrections of order
α2, even for heavy atoms (such as lanthanides).

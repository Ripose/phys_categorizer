Abstract. We have studied atomic diﬀraction at normal
incidence from an
evanescent standing wave with a high resolution using velocity selective Raman
transitions. We have observed up to 3 resolved orders of diﬀraction, which are well
accounted for by a scalar diﬀraction theory. In our experiment the transverse coherence
length of the source is greater than the period of the diﬀraction grating.

Resolved diﬀraction patterns from a reﬂection grating for atoms

2

Diﬀraction of atoms by periodic potentials has been a subject of study ever since
the beginning of the ﬁeld of atom optics. The most extensive work has been done in
a transmission geometry [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], but reﬂection gratings have
been demonstrated as well. Using evanescent wave mirrors, reﬂection gratings have been
produced by retroreﬂecting the laser beam creating the evanescent wave [12, 13, 14, 15]
or by temporally modulating the intensity of the evanescent wave [16]. Magnetic mirrors
have also been rendered periodic by adding an appropriate external magnetic ﬁeld [17].
Many early experiments on atomic reﬂection gratings were done at grazing
incidence, but this problem proved considerably more subtle than was ﬁrst imagined
(for a review see [18]). It turned out that atomic diﬀraction at grazing incidence cannot
be analogous to the diﬀraction of light (or X rays) on a reﬂection grating, because the
reﬂection is not on a hard wall, but on a soft barrier, so that the atom averages out
the grating modulation during the bounce. Alternatively, one can show that scalar
(i.e. without internal state change) atomic diﬀraction at grazing incidence on a soft
reﬂection grating would not allow energy and momentum conservation. This is why
grazing incidence atomic diﬀraction must be a process with an internal state change.
The change in internal energy allows the process to conserve energy. “Straightforward”,
scalar diﬀraction which is due only to a periodic modulation of the atomic wave front,
can only be achieved at normal incidence, as implemented in reference [13].

This experiment suﬀered however from a resolution which was not quite high enough
to separate the individual diﬀraction peaks. Although it was possible to deconvolve the
experimental resolution, and make a quantitative comparison with a scalar diﬀraction
theory, it was disappointing not to be able to directly see the diﬀraction peaks. Here we
discuss an improved version of this experiment in which we use velocity selective Raman
transitions to select and analyze a velocity class much narrower than what was possible
in the experiments of reference [13]. We are thus able to resolve the diﬀraction peaks.
Our results are also signiﬁcant from the point of view of measurements of the
roughness of atomic mirrors. These measurements have been performed for both
magnetic and evanescent wave mirrors [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Some of the interpretation
of these measurements relies on theoretical treatments developed in close analogy with
the theory of atom diﬀraction [24], and it is clearly useful to make additional tests of
the theory when possible.

Our velocity selection scheme is shown in ﬁgure 1. Two counterpropagating, phase-
locked lasers induce transitions between the two hyperﬁne levels of 85Rb. They are
detuned from resonance by about 600 MHz (∆ in ﬁgure 1). The detuning δ for this two
photon transition depends on the Doppler shift δ = kL(v
vR) [25], where kL is the
magnitude of the laser wavevector and vR the photon recoil velocity. Thus only atoms
with a given velocity v such that δ = 0 are resonant. The width of the velocity selection
is proportional to 1/τ , where τ is the duration of the pulse. This width can be much
smaller than the photon recoil velocity. Figure 1 shows the various laser frequencies
used for the Raman transitions and for the evanescent wave atomic mirror.

Our experiment follows closely the procedures of reference [23]. It consists of two

distinct sequences, each using two Raman pulses. First, to measure the atomic velocity
distribution after reﬂection, the following sequence is used. A sample of 85Rb atoms
are optically pumped into F=2 after preparation in a magneto-optical trap and optical
molasses, and released at time t = 0. A constant magnetic ﬁeld of 750 mG is turned on,
to deﬁne the axis of quantization and split the mF levels. A Raman π-pulse is applied
at t = 8 ms with detuning δS (selection). This transfers atoms from
vR
i
. At t = 47 ms, the Ti:Sa laser that forms the evanescent wave
into
is turned on. Its detuning is chosen so that it reﬂects atoms in F=3 (blue detuning),
while being attractive for the state F=2 (red detuning). This eliminates unselected
atoms left in F=2. The Ti:Sa laser is turned oﬀ at t = 67 ms. At t = 120 ms, a second
π-pulse is applied, with detuning δA (analysis), returning atoms in
3, 0, δA/kL + vR
i
. At t = 124 ms we switch on a pushing beam for 2 ms, resonant
to
for F=3, which accelerates F=3 atoms away from the detection region. Finally, the
measured signal is the ﬂuorescence of the remaining atoms in F=2, illuminated by a
resonant probe beam with repumper and measured with a photomultiplier tube. To
measure the number of atoms at the end of the sequence, we evaluate the area of a
Gaussian ﬁt of the ﬂuorescence signal.

This ﬁrst sequence is repeated ﬁxing δS and scanning δA. In this way, we build
up the velocity distribution of the reﬂected atoms. The frequencies δA are selected in a
random order, and after each shot, a second shot is taken with δS = δB (background)
suﬃciently detuned so that it does not transfer any atoms. Since we detect all atoms
in F=2, there is a small background of atoms that have not been selected, but instead
scattered a photon, thereby ﬁnishing in the same state as the atoms that have been
selected. This can occur during the analysis pulse, and during interaction with the
Ti:Sa laser. We estimate that around 10% of atoms undergo such processes in the

evanescent wave, and 1% during each π pulse. Most of these atoms are accounted for by
the background shot. The background shot is subtracted from the signal shot, and the
diﬀerence is the data point. We average each data point 5 times, so that a diﬀraction
pattern takes around 20 minutes to acquire.

To complete the experiment, we need to know the velocity distribution of the atoms
selected by the ﬁrst pulse. To measure this we employ a second sequence, essentially the
same as the ﬁrst, but without the mirror. Atoms are prepared in F = 3 at the end of the
optical molasses. At t = 8 ms the ﬁrst Raman pulse transfers resonant atoms to F = 2,
other atoms are removed with the pushing beam. At t = 22 ms the second Raman
pulse transfers atoms back in F = 3 and we ﬁnally detect only atoms in F = 3. By
scanning the detuning of the second Raman pulse we can measure the velocity width of
the atoms selected by the ﬁrst pulse. The observed velocity distribution is well ﬁtted by
a Gaussian function with a width given by 2 kL σv
2π/τ . Because of the convolution of
the selection and analysis pulses, the observed velocity distribution is approximately √2
times larger than that due to the selection pulse alone. For a pulse length of τ = 120 µs,
7.7 kHz or σv = 0.50 vR = 3.0 mm.s−1. We
the measured rms width is 2 kL σv = 2π
will use this Gaussian function as our resolution function S(δ). Any diﬀerences between
the two measured velocity distributions are attributed to the action of the diﬀraction
grating.

The reﬂection grating for atoms is made by retroreﬂecting a small proportion of
light that makes the evanescent wave: a standing wave is created on the mirror and the
potential seen by the atoms can be written (neglecting the van der Waals interaction
for the moment)

U(x, z) = U0e−2 κ z(1 + ǫ cos(2 kx x)),

where ǫ is the contrast of the interference pattern, 1/κ is the decay length of the electric
ﬁeld, and kx is the propagation wave vector of the evanescent wave. The contrast ǫ can
be written:

where R = IR/I0 is the intensity fraction of the laser beam that is retroreﬂected. To a
good approximation, the grating behaves as a thin phase grating, producing a modulated
de Broglie wave whose predicted phase modulation index is:

where λdB is the de Broglie wavelength of the atomic cloud incident on the mirror. The
van der Waals force introduces a multiplicative correction that here increases the phase
modulation index ϕ [13] by 12% .

In our experiments, κ = 1.14 kL. When the contrast of the grating ǫ is of order
1 rad, and the diﬀraction is eﬃcient. Here, λdB = 7 nm and

λdB/λL, we have ϕ

Figure 2. Experimental geometry. The Ti:Sa strikes the prism from below, with an
angle of incidence θ = 53◦. The system of polarizers and wave plates allows us to
reﬂect a small controlled amount of the Ti:Sa beam.

The nth diﬀraction order acquires a transverse momentum of 2 n ~ kx and has an
intensity of J 2
n(ϕ), where Jn is the Bessel function of order n. Here, kx = 1.5 kL, so to
distinguish two successive diﬀraction orders, we must have a velocity selection in the x
direction better than 1.5 vR.

Figure 2 shows the experimental geometry. The mirror is 20.7 mm below the
magneto-optical trap. It is a prism with an index of refraction of n = 1.869 and the
angle of incidence of the Ti:Sa laser θ = 53◦. The prism is superpolished and has a
roughness of about 0.07 nm deduced from measurements made with an atomic force
microscope and a Zygo optical heterodyne proﬁler. To remove the degeneracy of the
Zeeman sublevels, a magnetic bias ﬁeld of 750 mG is applied along the direction of
propagation of the Raman beams. After the ﬁrst π pulse, the direction of the magnetic
bias ﬁeld is rotated by 45◦ so that it lies along the y-direction, corresponding to the
quantization axis of the evanescent wave. The change is carried out over 10 ms, so that
the atoms adiabatically follow the ﬁeld. The direction of the ﬁeld is turned back after
the bounce for the second π pulse.

Also shown in ﬁgure 2 is the setup for measuring and controlling the retroreﬂected
power R. The two wave plates control the power, the half wave plate is used as a coarse
and the quarter wave plate as a ﬁne adjustment. A cat’s eye arrangement is used to
control the spatial superposition and size of the return beam. The experimental setup
for the Raman beams has been described elsewhere [23].

To measure R, ﬁrst the incident power is found from Pa and the (known)
transmission T of the ﬁrst mirror in ﬁgure 2. Then the quarter wave plate is turned to
the position that maximizes the power Pb. Next, the position of the half wave plate is
ﬁxed so that Pb/(Pa/T ) is the maximum value of R desired. Finally, the quarter wave
plate is adjusted to vary the R over the desired range. The fraction of power reﬂected

Each diﬀraction order has a weight given by the value of the Bessel function J 2
n(φ) and
is convolved by the resolution function S(δ), plus the function M(δ) that accounts for
a background of atoms whose velocity distribution is imposed by the spatial extent of
the mirror. The resolution function is a gaussian proﬁle with rms width 7.7 kHz. This
entire function is then multiplied by the function R(δ) which takes account of the spatial
variation of the Raman beams.

The widths of the functions R, S and M are calculated from measured values,
so that there are only four adjustable parameters for the ﬁtting procedure: an oﬀset
a, the amplitude of the curve b, the phase modulation index φ, and the background
term c. Figure 4 shows the ﬁtted and predicted phase modulation indices. The two

uncertainty in the superposition of the return beam.

To conclude, the fact that the peak heights can be accounted for by a series of Bessel
functions depending on a single parameter, the modulation index, is quite remarkable
and constitutes the central result of this work. It shows that one can reach a regime
in which the atomic diﬀraction on a corrugated mirror can be described simply as a
reﬂection of a scalar matter wave, with a phase modulation of the reﬂected wavefront
calculated within the straightforward thin phase grating approximation [26].
In this
regime, one thus have a close analogy to light diﬀraction oﬀ a reﬂection grating.

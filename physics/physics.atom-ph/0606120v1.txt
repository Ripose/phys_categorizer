Hydrogen molecule H2 is among the most important chemical objects which appear in Na-

ture. Since early days of quantum mechanics after pioneering paper by James and Coolidge

[1] many studies of H2 are carried out (see [2] and references therein). A goal of this brief

note is to present a simple and compact trial function which leads to the best ground state

BO energy among few-parametric trial functions.

The Hamiltonian which describes the hydrogen molecule under the assumption that the

protons are inﬁnitely massive (the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of zero order) can be

written as follows

where ˆpℓ = −i∇ℓ is the 3-vector of the momentum of the ℓth electron, the index κ runs

over protons A and B, rℓ,κ is the distance between ℓth electron and κ proton, r12 is the

interelectron distance, R is the interproton distance.

It is the established fact that the ground state is 1Σ+

g , the spin-singlet state, symmetric

under permutations of electron positions as well as proton positions.

As a method to explore the problem the variational procedure is used. The recipe of choice

of trial functions is based on a physical relevance arguments (see e.g.

[3]). In practice, it

implies that the perturbation theory where the variational energy is the sum of the ﬁrst

two terms should be convergent.
In order to study convergence and its rate we can ﬁnd
a potential for which our trial function ψ(trial) is the exact eigenfunction, Vtrial = ∆ψ(trial)
ψ(trial) .
One of the criteria of convergence is a requirement that the ratio | Vtrial
| should not grow if

V

r tends to inﬁnity or to positions of the Coulomb singularities. Hence, this ratio should be

bounded from above. In fact, a value of this bound controls the rate of convergence and

should be made as small as possible [4]. This procedure was successfully applied to a study

of one-electron molecular systems in a magnetic ﬁeld [5]. Eventually, the trial function for

the ground state was chosen in a form

ψ(trial) = A1ψ1 + A2ψ2 + A3ψ3

where

ψ1 = (1 + P12)(1 + PAB)e−α1r1A−α2r1B −α3r2A−α4r2B +γ1r12 ,

(2)

(3)

(4)

ψ2 = (1 + P12)e−α5(r1A+r2B )−α6(r1B +r2A)+γ2r12 ,

2

ψ3 = (1 + P12)e−α7(r1A+r1B )−α8(r2A+r2B )+γ3r12 ,

(5)

The P12 is the operator which interchanges electrons (1 ↔ 2) and PAB is the operator which

interchanges the two nuclei A ↔ B. The parameters α1−8, γ1−3 characterize (anti)screening

of the Coulomb charges and together with A1−3 are variational parameters. If the internu-

clear distance R is taken into account the trial function (2) depends on 14 parameters [9].

In a certain way, the function (4) models the interaction of two hydrogen atoms H + H,

while the function (5) models the interaction H +

2 + e. The function (3) is a non-linear in-
terpolation between (4) and (5). It looks analogous to Hund-Mulliken, Heitler-London and

Guillemin-Zener functions, respectively.

Calculations were performed using the minimization package MINUIT from CERN-LIB.

Multidimensional integration was carried out numerically using a dynamical partitioning

procedure: a domain of integration was divided into subdomains following an integrand

proﬁle and then each subdomain was integrated separately (for details see e.g. [5]). During

minimization process a partitioning was permanently adjusted. Numerical integration was

done with a relative accuracy of ∼ 10−6 − 10−7 by use of the adaptive D01FCF routine from

NAG-LIB. Computations were performed on a dual DELL PC with two Xeon processors

of 2.8 GHz each. Minimization process took about 1000 hours of CPU time but when a

minimum was found it takes several minutes to compute a variational energy.

Present results for the ground state of the H2 molecule and their comparison with results

of previous studies are presented in Table I. Our result for the total energy is more accurate

among those obtained with trial functions with ≤ 14 parameters. A reasonable agreement

for expectation values is also observed, except for < 3z2

1 > related to the quadrupole
moment. It seems evident that this expectation value should be studied separately (see [6]).

1 − r2

Variational parameters of the trial function (2) are shown in Table II. Concluding it is worth

noting that the trial function (2) can be easily modiﬁed for a study of spin-triplet states and

the states of the lowest energy with non-vanishing magnetic quantum numbers.

The authors express their gratitude to J.C. L´opez Vieyra for the interest to the work and

useful discussions.

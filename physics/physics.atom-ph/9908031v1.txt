Laser-cooled neutral atoms from a low-velocity atomic source are guided via a magnetic ﬁeld

generated between two parallel wires on a glass substrate. The atoms bend around three curves,

each with a 15-cm radius of curvature, while traveling along a 10-cm-long track. A maximum ﬂux of

2 · 106atoms/sec is achieved with a current density of 3 · 104A/cm2 in the 100 × 100-µm-cross-section

wires. The kinetic energy of the guided atoms in one transverse dimension is measured to be 42 µK.

Just as optical waveguides play a central role in many aspects of modern optics, from communications to integrated

optics, atom waveguides are likely to be an enabling technology for future atom-optics-based science. In particular,

well-characterized atom waveguides may make possible inertial and rotation measurements of exquisite sensitivity via

large-enclosed-area atom interferometers [1]. One of the ﬁrst guides for atoms was based on optical forces, where

hollow glass ﬁbers guide light, and the light in turn guides atoms [2,3].

Atom guiding using magnetic forces from current-carrying wires has been demonstrated more recently [4,5]. From

the point-of-view of using atom-guides to pursue precision metrology goals [6] much beneﬁt can be derived from

patterning the waveguides on a rigid substrate. First, beamsplitters can be precisely and reproducibly fabricated.

Second, the enclosed area of an interferometer can be precisely controlled. Third, the use of well-established litho-

graphic techniques means that progress on individual optical elements (a beamsplitter, or a monochromator, for

instance) can be rapidly extended to multi-component experiments. Mirrors based on micro-patterned wires have

already been introduced [7]. We report magnetic guiding by a pair of parallel wires produced on a glass substrate by

photolithography and subsequent electro-plating. Intricate two-dimensional guiding structures are easily produced by

this manufacturing technique; in the present case, it allows us to demonstrate guiding around curves in a 10 cm long

guide [8].

We guide weak-ﬁeld-seeking atoms along a one-dimensional magnetic-ﬁeld minimum. Our magnetic ﬁeld is produced

by two parallel wires with equal currents in the same direction. The track consists of two 100 × 100 µm wires spaced

200 microns from center to center, providing a 100 µm space between the wires. The resulting magnetic ﬁeld is zero

at the center between the wires and increases linearly outward. A small longitudinal ﬁeld is applied to prevent the

ﬁeld magnitude from vanishing at the track center. The maximum transverse guiding potential increases linearly with

applied current. The transverse magnetic-ﬁeld gradient around the center is proportional to the track current and

inversely proportional to the spacing between the wires. The wire spacing, applied wire current, and the longitudinal

velocity of the guided atoms determine the minimum radius of curvature around which the atoms can be bent.

Our experimental apparatus consists of two chambers connected by a 2-inch-diameter steel tube that holds the

substrate of the wire guide as shown in ﬁgure 1. The chambers are evacuated by separate ion pumps that maintain

the pressure in each chamber typically at 10−9 Torr. The source chamber provides a beam of laser-cooled atoms, and

the detection chamber houses a hot wire and channeltron electron multiplier to measure the atom ﬂux.

A modiﬁed magneto-optical trap (MOT) in the source chamber produces the beam of laser-cooled atoms [9]. A

diode laser in a master-oscillator power-ampliﬁer conﬁguration (MOPA) [10] provides 350 mW of single-frequency

light tuned near the 5S1/2(F = 2) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 3) transition in rubidium for trapping and cooling in the MOT. This

light is divided into three beams, which are directed into the chamber along orthogonal axes, and retro-reﬂected to

supply cooling along all directions. A 30-mW external-cavity diode laser [11] supplies light tuned to the 5S1/2(F =

1) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 2) transition to repump atoms that fall into the F = 1 ground state back into the cycling transition.

A 500-µm hole is drilled in the center of one of the retro-reﬂecting mirrors, and this mirror is placed inside the

vacuum chamber. Thus, one of the six conﬁning laser beams has a dark region in the center of its cross-section. The

radiation-pressure imbalance for atoms in the MOT that enter into the shadow of the hole accelerates those atoms

toward and then through the hole in the mirror. The resulting atomic beam is referred to as a low-velocity intense

source (LVIS) [12]. Our observations show that 90% of the LVIS ﬂux atoms are optically pumped into the F = 1

ground state by the MOT light. We observe that roughly 50% are in the mF = 0 state and the rest of the atoms are

roughly equally divided between the two mF = ±1 sublevels. Therefore, only 25% of LVIS atoms are in the correct

state to be guided. Typically, we measure an overall LVIS ﬂux of ∼ 5 · 108 atoms/sec and a beam brightness of

∼ 5 · 1012atoms/sr · sec. We estimate the transverse-velocity distribution entering our guide to be about vt = 5.0 ± 2.0

2

cm/sec [12]. A time-of-ﬂight measurement found the longitudinal velocity of LVIS to be vl = 10.1 ± 2.0 m/sec .

Our tracks were manufactured by Metrigraphics [13] using photolithography and electro-plating techniques. A layer

of photoresist is applied on top of a 3-µm-thick layer of copper deposited onto a 10 × 10 cm glass substrate (Fig. 2).

This photoresist is then exposed through a mask and removed where the tracks will be grown. Using an electro-plating

technique, the tracks are grown through the gaps in the photoresist to a height of 100 microns. The excess photoresist

and 3-µm copper layer are removed, leaving behind a track structure. The ﬁnal track structure extends 10 cm. We

solder current-feeding wires to connection pads on the glass substrate.

The tracks are aligned with the mirror hole before the vacuum chambers are assembled. We deﬁne the track axis

as the line joining the beginning and the end of the track (Fig. 2). The beginning of the track sits 1 mm behind

the mirror hole and its axis is aligned parallel to the mirror axis (Fig. 1). The magnetic guide starts with a 1.2 cm

straight region followed by a 1.9-cm-long curve to the right with a 15 cm radius of curvature (Fig. 2). The curvature

is then reversed for a 3.8-cm-long left curve. This region is followed by a 1.9-cm-long right curve, completing the

three alternating curves and leading back to the track axis. The three curves lead atoms around a bend, diverting

their trajectory by 2 mm transverse to the track axis. After the bend, the guide conﬁnes atoms for another 1.2 cm

to a straight trajectory before they exit the magnetic guide and travel 7 cm through free space to the detector hot

wire. We place a glass barrier halfway along the track axis (Fig. 2) to block out direct LVIS ﬂux. Guided atoms

are led around this barrier by the magnetic guide and can be detected downstream. For our guiding experiment we

run 35-msec-long current pulses of up to 4.5 A through the two wires. We choose short current pulses to prevent the

substrate from overheating, allowing us to run larger guiding currents than continuous currents would allow.

After exiting the guide, atoms are ionized by the hot wire and the subsequent ions are then detected by the

channeltron. The 70-µm-diameter hot wire placed ∼ 7 cm from the output of the magnetic guide intercepts a small

fraction of the diverging atomic beam. We determine the total ﬂux from our guide by integrating over the atom-beam

proﬁle. At a current of 3.0 A, we guide up to 2 · 106 atoms/sec.

Figure 3 shows the atom-ﬂux dependence on the track wire current. For low currents (<0.7 A), the guiding potential

should be suﬃcient to conﬁne the initial transverse-velocity distribution, but it does not provide suﬃcient force to

bend the atoms around the curve; hence no ﬂux is observed at the detector (Fig. 3). Above the estimated centripetal

track current threshold of 0.7 A, atoms with low longitudinal velocity are guided. At currents above 2.3 A, the ﬂux

saturates as we have suﬃcient magnetic gradient to guide all longitudinal velocities around the bend.

In our design, the magnetic-ﬁeld minimum is 50 µm above the substrate. By lowering the position of the magnetic-

ﬁeld minimum, and thus the guiding center of the track, to near or below the substrate, we should be able to guide

the atoms into the glass. We do this by applying a bias ﬁeld transverse to the track and parallel to the substrate

with a pair of Helmholtz coils. Depending on the polarity of our Helmholtz coils, the minimum is either raised or

lowered. This variable bias ﬁeld is set up at the ﬁnal 1-2 cm stretch of our guide, after the atoms have negotiated the

bend. We observe that for one polarity of the coils the guided ﬂux changes by ∼ 10%, but as the bias ﬁeld polarity

is reversed, the ﬂux is completely eliminated (Fig. 4). In the ﬁrst case, the bias ﬁeld lifts the ﬁeld minimum out of

the tracks, but atoms still make it to the hot wire, although they are shifted vertically. In the second case, we lower

the ﬁeld minimum and atoms are guided into the substrate surface. Once atoms touch the substrate, they stick and

can no longer be guided. As expected, larger track currents require larger bias ﬁelds to push atoms into the substrate

(Fig. 4). The bias ﬁeld required to entirely squelch the guided-atom ﬂux is directly determined by the track current.

The three track currents of 1.25, 2.0 and 3.0 A should correspond to squelching bias ﬁelds of 21, 33, and 49 Gauss,

respectively. Our bias-ﬁeld measurement shows that for the above track currents 21, 34, and 43 Gauss are necessary

to cut oﬀ the ﬂux, which is in good agreement with the estimates .

We measure the guided atoms’ transverse velocity proﬁle by translating the hot wire to map out the spatial extent

of the atom beam as it diverges from the exit of the track (Fig. 5). We calculate that the atoms’ emergence from the

conﬁning ﬁelds of the tracks is almost completely non-adiabatic—the transverse kinetic energy of the emerging beam

should thus be a faithful reﬂection of the transverse kinetic energy in the guide. The virial theorem tells that the

mean potential energy in the linear conﬁning ﬁeld should be twice the mean kinetic energy. The total mean energy

per transverse dimension of the atoms in the guide should thus be three times the observed kinetic energy of the

emerging atoms. At a track current of 2 A, we can determine that the guided atoms have 3 × 42µK = 126µK total

mean energy per transverse dimension (Fig. 5). This is smaller than the lowest point on the rim of the conﬁning

potential, which is 1.1 mK.

In the discussion above we apply a bias ﬁeld parallel to the substrate and perpendicular to the track. Similarly, we

can apply a transverse bias ﬁeld in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the substrate. In this conﬁguration the

guided atom beam is moved close to one of the wires and the highest-energy component of the beam is ”skimmed

oﬀ”. Figure 5 shows a case in which the mean energy in the corresponding direction has been reduced by a factor of

3.1 using a 43 Gauss bias ﬁeld.

Due to the non-adiabatic loading into our tracks, atoms entering the center portion of the guide are more likely to

be guided. The eﬀective aperture through which atoms can enter the guide is consequently smaller than the physical

wire separation. Comparing the estimated source ﬂux to the number of atoms detected after the guide, we estimate

that ∼ 25% of the mF = −1 atoms that hit the 100 × 100 µm opening are detected.

In summary, we have guided a beam of laser-cooled atoms between two 100 × 100 µm wires. We are able to bend the

atoms’ trajectory around 15-cm-radius curves. The guiding-current threshold agrees with our theoretical prediction

to within our uncertainty from the atoms’ longitudinal velocity. We demonstrate that moderate current densities give

guiding potentials of several milli Kelvin. No external cooling for the wires was necessary. Our magnetic guide design

has great promise for applications in atom interferometers due to its versatility and simplicity. We tested the tracks

with current pulses up to 8 A before substrate heating became a problem. This test indicates that we can reduce

the radius of curvature by a factor of 4 to achieve a 3-4 cm track radius. In future experiments with larger currents,

we hope to guide the atoms around a full 360 degree bend, which is an important step for a possible future Sagnac

interferometer using magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁnement. Photolithographic technology will provide a reproducible method

for producing an atom beamsplitter in future atom-interferometer applications.

Magnetic Guide Current (A)

FIG. 3. Flux versus current. As we increase the current in the guiding wires the magnetic ﬁeld and its gradient between the

wires increases and atoms are guided. For low currents (< 0.7 A), the longitudinal velocity of the atoms is too large to be bent

around the curve. We increase the current, and the guiding ﬂux increases until saturating (> 2.3 A), when all atoms between

the wires are guided. Each data point represents the average of 50 current pulses; the statistical errors are typically smaller

than the plotted symbols.

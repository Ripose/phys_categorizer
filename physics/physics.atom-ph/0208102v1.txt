Abstract

The spectrum of the (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) four-body system was calculated in an adiabatic approach.

The two-electron energies were approximated by a sum of two single-electron eﬀective charge two-

center energies as suggested in [6]. While the structure of the spectrum does not exclude the

existence of long-lived states, their experimental observability is still to be clariﬁed.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most impressive success-stories of the last decade in few-body physics are

the high-precision experimental and theoretical studies of long-lived states in antiprotonic

helium [1, 2, 3, 4]. In view of this fact it is natural to pose the question, whether such long-

lived antiprotonic states can exist in other systems, too. There were some experimental

attempts to observe delayed components in annihilation products after stopping of slow

antiprotons in diﬀerent media [5], however, except for helium, no evidence of long-lived

states was found. Theoretical predictions concerning the possible existence of such states

could largely increase the willingness of experimentalists to go on with their attempts.

There are two possible directions in which further candidates for long-lived antiprotonic

states could be searched for. First, one could consider atoms with electron structure similar

to helium, that is, noble gases with closed outermost electron shells. This possibility was

examined in some detail in [6] with an essentially negative answer concerning the possibility

of formation of long-lived states after antiproton capture in noble gases.

The second possibility is to consider the next simplest atom, the lithium, which has three

electrons, one of which could be replaced by the antiproton. In order to get an idea of the

possibility of the occurrence of long-lived states in this four-body system, we have performed

a semi-quantitative calculation of its level structure.

II. CALCULATION METHOD

The Hamiltonian of the (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) four-body system can be written as

ˆH = −

∆R −

+ ˆh(2)(r1, r2; R),

R

with the two-electron Hamiltonian

ˆh(2)(r1, r2; R) = ˆh(1)(r1; R) + ˆh(1)(r2; R) +

1
|r1 − r2|

The single-electron two-center Hamiltonian ˆh(1) corresponds to the electron motion in the

ﬁeld of Li3+ and ¯p ﬁxed at a distance R:

In eqs.(1-3) R is the vector pointing from Li3+ to ¯p, while the ri are the electron coordinates

measured from the Li3+ − ¯p center of mass. 1 M is the reduced mass of Li3+ and ¯p:

while α is deﬁned as

m¯p
mLi3+ + m¯p
To calculate the spectrum of this four-body system or, at least, a part of it, we have used

α =

a Born-Oppenheimer-like (BO) approximation, in which the solution of the Schr¨odinger-

equation

( ˆH − EJ

n )ΨJ

n(r1, r2, R) = 0

is attempted in two successive steps. First, the equation

(ˆh(2)(r1, r2; R) − ε(2)

nµ(R))Φnµ(r1, r2; R) = 0,

describing the motion of two electrons in the ﬁeld of Li3+ and ¯p separated by a ﬁxed vector

R, has to be solved. The solutions Φnµ are characterized by the conserved quantum number

µ – the sum of the electron angular momentum projections on the R direction. Next, the

total wave function ΨJ

n(r1, r2, R) is approximated as a single product:

ΨJ

n(r1, r2, R) =

angular variables (φ, Θ) of R. In deriving Eq.(7), according to the adiabatic approximation,

substituting

Eq.(4),

Eq.(6)

into

arising from the diﬀerence are very small and the accuracy of our calculation does not necessitate their
consideration

terms containing the derivatives of Φnµ(r1, r2; R) with respect to R are neglected. In BO

type calculations usually the lowermost electron conﬁgurations are used, for which µ = 0

(so called σ-term) in which case the D-function in Eq.(6) reduces to a spherical harmonics

YJMJ .

For a one-electron problem Eq.(5) is replaced by

(ˆh(1)(ri; R) − ε(1)

nµ(R))ϕnµ(ri; R) = 0

(8)

and it can be solved exactly by separation of variables in spheroidal coordinates ϕnµ(ri; R)

being the well-known two-center wave functions. In our case, however, the problem of two

interacting electrons in the ﬁeld of two ﬁxed Coulomb-centers is not solvable exactly and the

determination of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions necessitates a highly non-trivial calculation.

One could think of a variational approach of the type [7]; another possibility could be the

diagonalization of the electron-electron interaction on the basis of two-center functions. In

both cases the calculations are quite cumbersome and slowly converging when the size of the

basis is increased. Since we believe, that the question of possible existence of metastability

in antiprotonic lithium can be studied by a semi-qualitative exploration of its spectrum, we

have chosen a simpler, elegant and eﬃcient method of calculation for ε(2)

nµ(R) proposed in [6].

The main idea of the method is to represent the two-electron energy eigenvalue as a sum

of two single-electron energies:

ε(2)(R) = ε(1)

Z1,Z2(R) + ε(1)

z1,z2(R), 3

(9)

where ε(1)

Z1,Z2(R) and ε(1)

z1,z2(R) are energy eigenvalues of two-center equations of the type
(8) with eﬀective charges (Z1, Z2) and (z1, z2) instead of the physical charges (3, −1). The
eﬀective charges (z1, z2) are chosen in such a way, that ε(1)

z1,z2(R = ∞)
should reproduce the experimental values of the ﬁrst ionization potentials of He atom and

z1,z2(R = 0) and ε(1)

Li+ ion, respectively. Thus we get z1 = 2.3578 and z2 = −1.0135. As for (Z1, Z2), the

corresponding two-center eigenvalues in the R = 0 and R = ∞ limits should reproduce the

second ionization potentials of He and Li+, and the second electron is in this case the last

one, therefore the physical values Z1 = 3 and Z2 = −1 were taken. The electron-electron

repulsion is taken into account in this method by the deviation of the eﬀective charges (z1, z2)

from their physical (integer) values. In this way the approximate ε(2)(R) of Eq.(9) reproduces

the experimental two-electron binding for the two limiting cases R = 0 and R = ∞, while

for intermediate R-values the solution of the corresponding (eﬀective) two-center problems

seems to provide a reasonable interpolation prescription. This approach has been checked

in the case of (He2+ + ¯p + 2e) and (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) systems; its results were compared with

those of a detailed variational calculation of [7]. Results of the calculations are presented

in Fig.(1). The agreement of ε(2)(R) obtained from Eq. (9) with the variational values is

amazingly good in a wide range of R. The same procedure was applied to calculate the

energy of the ﬁrst excited electron conﬁguration, where the limiting cases were adjusted to

reproduce the energies of the ﬁrst excited (1s2s) states of He and Li+.

among the states with the same J-value.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The resulting spectrum of the (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) system is shown in Fig.(3). Apart from

the energy levels of the initial system (full black circles) we have shown also the energies of

daughter states which can be formed after Auger-emission of one or two electrons. The open

circles correspond to the energies of the (Li3+ + ¯p + e) three-particle system, while the open

squares are the hydrogen-like two-particle energies of the (Li3+ + ¯p) system. Comparing the

spectra of Fig.(3) with the well-known spectra of the He atomcules (see e.g.

[8]), we can

ﬁnd some apparent similarities and diﬀerences. The basic similarity can be formulated as

follows: there are many states in the spectrum, from which Auger-emission is possible only

with large electron orbital momentum and therefore is strongly suppressed. This could be

one reason for metastability of these states; of course, this is only a necessary condition and

The basic diﬀerence, on the other hand, is the much higher density of states in the

expected capture region (around the Li atom ground state energy) which is due to the

essential diﬀerence in the electron structure of He and Li: the last electron is strongly

bound in He, while very loosely in Li.

It can be noted, that the spectrum of the (Li3+ + ¯p + e) system (open circles) strongly

resembles the He atomcule spectrum, therefore long-lived states in an isolated (Li3+ + ¯p + e)

system could be certainly expected. However, in contrast to the He case, this system is

charged and thus its interaction with atoms of the surrounding medium might be more

violent, leading to a faster collisional de-excitation of these states.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the spectra of (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) and (Li3+ + ¯p + e) four- and three-body

systems. Although the structure of the obtained spectra allows the existence of long-lived

states, our calculations do not put us in a position to make deﬁnite statements about their

experimental observability. This latter depends on several further factors, as well. One is

the formation mechanism: for the time being we have no information about the population

rate of the huge amount of states in the vicinity of expected antiproton capture energy. The

physics of formation of the (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) system in the reaction

(Li3+ + 3e) + ¯p −→ (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) + e

is quite diﬀerent from the analogous process in He due to the large diﬀerence in the binding

energies of the outermost electron.

In the Li atom the ﬁrst ionization potential is only

0.198 a.u., which means that even adiabatic ionization is possible: when the distance between

the antiproton and Li atom becomes less than 5 a.u., the binding energy of the last electron

in their common ﬁeld becomes zero and the electron is ”pushed” into a continuum state.

Another unknown factor is the way, how the eventually formed (Li3+ + ¯p + 2e) systems

interact with the media atoms and what is the role of collisional de-excitation in their

life-time. In any case, in order to reduce the undesired eﬀect of this factor, probably, the

experiments looking for long-lived states should be performed in dilute vapors of Li.

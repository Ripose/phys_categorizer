We have observed thermalization by elastic collisions of magnetically trapped metastable helium
atoms. Our method directly samples the reconstruction of a thermal energy distribution after the
application of an RF knife. The relaxation time of our sample towards equilibrium gives an elastic
collision rate constant of α ∼ 5 × 10−9cm3/s at a temperature of 1 mK. This value is close to the
unitarity limit.

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of dilute atomic va-
pors has been observed in Rb [1], Na [2], Li [3] and H [4].
Atoms in these gases are in their electronic ground state.
Metastable helium in the 2 3S1 state (He∗), which has
long been of interest to the laser cooling community, is
by contrast in a state 20 eV above the ground state. This
situation presents new possibilities for the study of cold
dilute atomic gases. First, the large internal energy per-
mits eﬃcient detection by ionization of other atoms and
surfaces: it is possible to study very small samples. Sec-
ond, Penning ionization by both the background gas and
between trapped atoms oﬀers a high time resolution mon-
itor of the number and density of trapped atoms. Third,
the possibility of using the large internal energy of He*
for atomic lithography has already been demonstrated
[5], and this application as well as atom holography [6]
may beneﬁt from highly coherent sources. Finally, much
theoretical work has already been devoted to estimation
of the elastic collision cross sections on the one hand and
Penning ionizing rates on the other [7, 8]. Experiments
such as the one reported here can test this work.

BEC is achieved in dilute gases by evaporative cool-
ing of a magnetically trapped sample [9]. In He∗, it is
hampered by the fact that in a magneto-optical trap, the
typical starting point of magnetic trapping, the achiev-
able atomic density is limited by a large light-assisted
Penning ionization rate [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. On the
other hand, the scattering length for low energy elastic
collisions is predicted to be quite large, and the Penning
ionization rate highly suppressed in a spin polarized sam-
ple [7, 8]. He* in a magnetic trap necessarily constitutes
a spin polarized sample and experiments have already
demonstrated a suppression of more than one order of
magnitude [16, 17, 18]. If the theoretical estimates are
right, eﬃcient evaporative cooling may still be possible in
spite of the low initial trap density. We report here the
observation of the thermalization of He∗ due to elastic
collisions which appears to roughly bear out the predic-
tions.

To perform a thermalization experiment, a trapped
cloud is deliberately placed out of equilibrium and its
relaxation due to the elastic collisions between trapped
particles is observed. Usually the observations are made
by imaging the spatial distribution as a function of time

[19, 20, 21]. In our experiment the relaxation is observed
in the energy distribution of the atoms in the magnetic
trap. First this distribution is truncated above ERF = hν
by a radio-frequency pulse (or RF knife) of frequency ν.
The cloud rethermalizes by elastic collisions and the pop-
ulation of the states of energy higher than ERF increases
from zero; for large times compared to the thermalization
time τth the distribution reaches a thermal distribution
[22]. With the help of an analytical model and numerical
simulations, we deduce τth from the time dependence of
the number of atoms with energy above ERF. We mea-
sure this time dependence by applying a second RF knife
after a delay time t, and with a frequency slightly above
that of the ﬁrst one. Our model also allows us to relate
τth to the elastic collision rate per atom in the trap.

Much of our setup has been described previously [14,
17]. Brieﬂy, we use a LN2 cooled DC discharge source
to produce a beam of metastable He atoms. The beam
is slowed down to ∼ 100 m/s using Zeeman slowing and
loads a magneto-optical trap. Typically, 3×108 atoms are
trapped at a peak density of 3 × 109 at/cm3, limited by
light-induced Penning ionization. The temperature of the
cloud is about 1 mK and the cloud is roughly spherical
with an RMS size of 2.5 mm. We then apply a 5 ms
Doppler molasses to cool the atoms down to 300 µK. This
is achieved by switching oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld, decreasing
the detuning close to resonance and lowering the intensity
to 10 % of its value in the MOT. An optical pumping
step allows us to trap up to 1.5 × 108 atoms in a Ioﬀe-
Pritchard trap. We use a ”cloverleaf” conﬁguration [23]
with B′ = 85 G/cm, B′′ = 25 G/cm2 and a bias ﬁeld
B0 = 200 G. The two sets of coils are outside the vacuum,
separated by 4 cm. After lowering the bias ﬁeld to 4 G,
the temperature of the compressed atomic sample reaches
1 mK. The lifetime of the trap is 60 s.

We use a 2 stage microchannel plate (MCP) to detect
the atoms. The MCP is placed 5 cm below the trap-
ping region and has an active area of 1.4 cm diameter.
Two grids above the MCP allow us to repel all charged
particles and detect only the He*. After turning oﬀ the
magnetic trap, the MCP signal corresponds to a time of
ﬂight spectrum (TOF) which gives the temperature of
the atoms. The area of this spectrum is proportional to
the number of atoms in the trap at the time it was turned

oﬀ. The collection and detection eﬃciency of the MCP
varies by roughly a factor of two depending on the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration we use, and so one must take
care to only use data corresponding to the same mag-
netic ﬁeld when making comparisons. We also use the
MCP to monitor the atoms falling out of the trap while
applying an RF knife. The area of the MCP signal in this
case measures the number of atoms with an energy above
that of the RF knife. Finally, when we bias the grids so
as to attract positive ions, the MCP signal can be used
to observe the products of Penning ionization with the
background gas while the trap is on. This signal is pro-
portional to the number of trapped atoms. We observe
an exponential decay, indicating that two body loss (He*
+ He*) is negligible.

Two parallel coils in the vacuum system produce an RF
magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the bias ﬁeld and consti-
tutes the RF knife. To understand the eﬀect of the RF
knife on the trapped cloud and to assure that our sam-
ple is at thermal equilibrium, we ﬁrst performed an RF
spectroscopy measurement of the energy of the atoms in
the trap [24]. We apply an RF pulse at a frequency hν
which changes the Zeeman sublevel of the atoms from the
trapped M = +1 state to M = 0. The duration of the
knife is 3 s, which is necessary to expel all the atoms with
energy above hν over the entire range which we explore.
We then turn oﬀ the magnetic trap to measure the num-
ber of remaining atoms. Observation of the atoms falling
onto the MCP during the RF knife shows that the ﬂux of
atoms expelled is negligible at the end of the pulse. An
example of the RF spectrum is shown in Fig. 1a). The
derivative of the data gives the energy distribution. In
Fig. 1b) we compare this distribution with a thermal one
at 1.1 mK, the temperature measured by an independent
TOF measurement. We conclude that our atomic sample
is close to thermal equilibrium.

We begin the thermalization experiment with a 2 s

RF knife of frequency ν1 = 135 MHz (corresponding to
η = (hν − 2µBB0)/kBT ∼ 6). Next we measure the
number of atoms falling onto the MCP during a second
RF knife at a slightly higher frequency (ν2 = 138 MHz)
and delayed by a time t. Assuming that the angular dis-
tribution of the atoms expelled by the second RF knife
is constant during the thermalization process, the MCP
signal is proportional to the number of expelled atoms.
Plots of the number of expelled atoms as a function of t
are shown in Fig. 2 for samples having diﬀerent numbers
of atoms but the same temperature to within 10%. Fig. 2
shows that the number of atoms above the RF knife in-
creases rapidly and then falls again with a time constant
close to the trap lifetime as atoms are lost. If the ini-
tial increase is indeed due to thermalizing collisions, the
initial slope of each curve should be proportional to the
square of the number of atoms. Our data roughly conﬁrm
this dependence.

To be more quantitative, and to determine the ther-
malization time τth, we use a model based on the Boltz-
mann equation under the suﬃcient ergodicity hypothesis
and inspired by [25]. We divide the sample into two en-
and E+, with energies below and above
ergy regions, E
ηkBT respectively and denote by N
and N+ the num-
ber of atoms belonging to the two regions. We assume
that η ≫ 1. Immediately after truncation, N+ = 0, and
we seek a diﬀerential equation governing the time depen-
dence of N+. Since η ≫ 1, we only take into account
collisions of the type (E
) + (E+), and
) + (E
neglect all collisions involving two atoms in E+ in either
the ﬁnal or initial state. The corresponding ﬂux ˙N+ is
thus of the form

the Zeeman slowing laser. The lifetime of the trap is 38 ± 4 s,
and the temperature is 0.9 ± 0.1 mK.

If we make the further approximations that the atoms
in E
and E+ have thermal distributions [26], neglect
variations of the temperature during thermalization and
assume that the collision cross section σ is independent
of velocity, ∆1 and ∆2 are analytic functions of the trap
parameters, atomic mass m, σ, η and µBB0/kBT . This
latter parameter appears because our trap cannot be
approximated by an harmonic trap; we use the semi-
linear form [25].
It is straightforward to take into ac-
count the ﬁnite lifetime τ of the atomic sample since
(0) exp (−t/τ ). The solution of the

The elastic collision rate is γel = nσv with n deﬁned at
the center of the trap and v = 4pkBT /πm. The quan-
tities Vev, Ve and q are deﬁned as in [25, 27]; they are
analytic functions of η and µBB0/kBT . The quantity q
is the ratio of the number of atoms below the RF knife to
the total for a thermal distribution (about 0.9 under our
conditions), and Nth is the asymptotic value of N+ for
inﬁnite trap lifetime. Numerical simulations of the en-
ergy form of Boltzmann equation are in good agreement
with our model for η > 10; for η = 6 the quantity γelτth
is 1.8 times larger meaning that our assumption about
the distribution function fails for small η [27]. We take
this factor into account in calculating γel.

To ﬁt the data of Fig. 2 with eq. (2), we ﬁx the lifetime
τ at its measured value and use τth and Nth as adjustable
parameters. The uncertainty in τth is estimated by vary-
ing the lifetime of the trap within its uncertainty range
and looking at the resulting dispersion in τth. The uncer-

responding TOF spectrum (proportional to the number of
trapped atoms). The solid line shows a linear ﬁt constrained
to pass through the origin.

tainty in the number of trapped atoms is estimated from
the dispersion of the TOF area measurements before and
after taking a curve as in Fig. 2. The exact value of q
has little inﬂuence on the ﬁt.

We have made several tests to check the consistency of
our results. First, we have checked that the ﬁtted value of
Nth corresponds to the expected fraction of atoms above
the knife for our temperature. Second, Fig. 3 shows that
th is proportional to the number of trapped atoms, as
τ −
it must be if the process of reﬁlling of the upper energy
class is due to two body collisions. We can exclude any
eﬀect independent of the number of atoms. The line pass-
ing through the origin uses the slope as a ﬁt parameter
and has χ2 = 5 for 8 degrees of freedom. Third we have
done an additional experiment that conﬁrms the presence
of elastic collisions: in a trap decay rate experiment, in
the presence of the RF knife, the ion signal exhibits a
clear non-exponential behaviour at short times. This ef-
fect can be satisfactorily interpreted as elastic collisions
bringing atoms above the RF knife and hence allows a
measurement of the evaporation rate. This rate is con-
sistent with the results obtained in our thermalization
experiment. Fourth we have checked that heating can-
not explain the repopulation of the upper energy classes.
With the trap undisturbed, we can place an upper limit
on the heating rate of 25 µK in 60 s. This limit is two or-
ders of magnitude too low to explain our data. Lastly, we
have performed the thermalization experiment for diﬀer-
ent lifetimes of the magnetic trap (20, 40 and 60 s) and
found consistent results.

From our data in Fig. 3, we can deduce an accurate
measurement of the thermalization time; the ﬁt gives
τth = 3.0 ± 0.3 s for the densest sample. Using the mea-
sured temperature and bias ﬁeld, this value of τth leads
1; this result depends on the accuracy
to γel = 6 ± 1 s−
of our thermalization model. To ﬁnd the rate constant
α = γel/n, we must estimate the density. Since the data

show that our sample is close to thermal equilibrium, we
can calculate the volume of the trap knowing the trap
parameters. The absolute measurement of the number
of atoms is performed by measuring the total power ab-
sorbed from a saturating laser beam, similar to [15]. A
TOF area of 75 mV.s corresponds to 108 atoms in the
magnetic trap with an uncertainty of a factor of 2. This
9 cm3/s to within a factor 3 at
leads to α = 5 × 10−
T = 1 ± 0.1 mK. The ENS-Paris group has obtained a
similar result with a diﬀerent measurement [28]. The uni-
8 cm3/s. This
tarity limit at that temperature is α ∼ 10−
means that it is probably not valid to use a constant elas-
tic cross section in our model and some deviation might
appear in the quantity γelτth. We are currently investi-
gating reﬁnements to our thermalization model.

The results shown here are very encouraging for

evaporative cooling of He* in search of BEC.

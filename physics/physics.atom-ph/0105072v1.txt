Dynamics of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate beyond mean ﬁeld theory

(February 2, 2008)

We study the dynamics of a two-mode Bose-Einstein con-
densate in the vicinity of a mean-ﬁeld dynamical instability.
Convergence to mean-ﬁeld theory (MFT), with increasing to-
tal number of particles N , is shown to be logarithmically slow.
Using a density matrix formalism rather than the conven-
tional wavefunction methods, we derive an improved set of
equations of motion for the mean-ﬁeld plus the ﬂuctuations,
which goes beyond MFT and provides accurate predictions for
the leading quantum corrections and the quantum break time.
We show that the leading quantum corrections appear as de-
coherence of the reduced single-particle quantum state; we
also compare this phenomenon to the eﬀects of thermal noise.
Using the rapid dephasing near an instability, we propose a
method for the direct measurement of scattering lengths.

(This Hamiltonian is an eﬀective low-energy ap-
in the sense that short wavelength de-

grees of freedom have been eliminated:
in the regime of ultracold scattering, where short dis-
tance modes are only populated virtually, during brief
two-body collisions.) At very low temperatures, Bose-
Einstein condensation occurs, so that a large fraction of
the particles occupy the same single-particle state, char-
acterized by the single particle wave function Ψ(r, t). In
this regime one can formulate a perturbative expansion
in the small quantity N −1/2, where N is the number of
particles in the condensate, whose result at leading order
is the Gross-Pitaevskii nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
(GPE) governing the condensate wave function:

The Gross-Pitaevskii mean ﬁeld theory (MFT) pro-
vides a classical ﬁeld equation for nonlinear matter waves,
which is generally considered as ‘the classical limit’ of
the Heisenberg equation of motion for the ﬁeld opera-
tor ˆψ (which is of precisely the same form). We can
make precise the sense in which it is a classical limit,
by reformulating the system governed by (7) in the path
integral representation. We will not actually use this
formulation in this paper; we merely note the GPE is the
saddlepoint equation that appears in a steepest descents
approximation to the path integral. This is precisely
the standard semi-classical approximation, with the ex-
ception that 1/N is playing the role usually played by
¯h.
Hence despite the resemblance of the GPE to a
Schr¨odinger equation, complete with ﬁnite ¯h, we can in-
deed identify MFT as the classical limit, in essentially
0, of the quantum ﬁeld
the same sense as in the case ¯h
theory. Because N in current trapped dilute alkali gas
BEC experiments is characteristically large (typically of
the order 105
108 atoms), qualitatively signiﬁcant quan-
tum corrections to MFT are hard to observe, and the GP
theory is highly successful in predicting experimental re-
sults.

The entire ﬁeld of quantum chaos is founded upon one
property of the classical limit, however, which is that
convergence to classicality as ¯h

slow if classical trajectories diverge exponentially. This
implies that we must expect strong quantum corrections

that after the quantum break time, a condensate will
become signiﬁcantly depleted, as exponential production
of quasi-particles transfers particles to orthogonal modes
[1]. Depletion of the condensate means, by deﬁnition,
that the single particle reduced density matrix (SPDM)
becomes quantum mechanically less pure. Hence for a
condensate, just as the classical limit of the quantum
ﬁeld theory resembles the quantum mechanics of a single
particle, so quantum corrections at the ﬁeld theory level
appear as quantum decoherence in the single-particle pic-
ture. Since decoherence is most often considered as en-
forcing classicality, there is something like irony in this
situation. And it suggests that studying the corrections
to MFT for Bose-Einstein condensates may give us some
new insights into decoherence; and that some aspects of

(2)

decoherence may be useful in understanding condensates
beyond MFT. This is the motivation for the work we
now report.

In this paper we provide the details of a previously pub-
lished study [2] of the correspondence between mean-ﬁeld
and exact quantum dynamics of a two-mode BEC. The
model system contains an isolated dynamical instabil-
ity for certain regions of parameter space. We show that
quantum corrections in the vicinity of this unstable state,
do indeed become signiﬁcant on a short log(N ) time
scale, whereas quantum eﬀects in other regions of phase
space remain small 1/√N corrections. We present a sim-
ple theory that goes beyond MFT and provides accurate
predictions of the leading quantum corrections, by taking
one further step in the so called Bogoliubov-Born-Green-
Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy. In accordance with
our view of quantum corrections as decoherence, we use
a density-matrix Bloch picture to depict the dephasing
process. The density-matrix formalism has the addi-
tional advantage of allowing for initial conditions that
are not covered by the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Gaus-
sian ansatz, and which better correspond to the physical
state of the system.

II. THE TWO-MODE CONDENSATE

We consider a BEC in which particles can only ef-
fectively populate either one of two second-quantized
modes. Two possible experimental realizations of this
model are illustrated in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst (Fig 1a) is
a condensate conﬁned in a double-well trap [3–8] which
may be formed by splitting a harmonic trap with a far
oﬀ resonance intense laser sheet [9]. In this case single-
particle tunneling provides a linear coupling between the
local mode solutions of the individual wells, which can
in principle be tuned over a wide range of strengths by
adjusting the laser sheet intensity. The two-mode regime
is reached when the self-interaction energy gn is small
compared to the spacing between the trap modes ¯hωtrap:

gn =

4π¯h2a

ml2 = ¯hωtrap ,

where l is the characteristic trap size. Thus the two-mode
condition is,

The two-mode condition (4) may be met by double-well
traps with characteristic frequencies of the order of 100
Hz, containing several hundred particles. When con-
structed, larger traps will maintain the two-mode limit
at higher N .

(4)

The second experimental realization of a two-mode
BEC is the eﬀectively two-component spinor condensate
[10,11] depicted in Fig. 1b. In this case the linear cou-
pling between the modes is provided by a near resonant
radiation ﬁeld [12,13].

which the spatial state is ﬁxed and essentially indepen-

for available alkali gases all aij diﬀer only by a few per-
cent, ξ− << ξ+, and hence the two-mode regime can be
reached with N < 104 atoms in weak, nearly spherical
100 Hz). Less isotropic traps obviously
traps (ωtrap ≤
reach the two-mode regime only at smaller N . To ex-
tend the internal state two mode regime to larger N we
must make the trap weaker; for ﬁxed N , ξ− scales with
sample size L as L3/2. Hence to ensure L/ξ− < 1 for
ﬁxed N requires a suﬃciently large (weak) trap. For
Rb and Na experiments, whose lifetimes are limited by
three-body collisions, the slowing down of the two-mode
dynamics at reduced total density should be more than
compensated for by the extended condensate lifespan.

In both realizations, the many-body Hamiltonian re-
duces in the two-mode limit (and in the spinor realization
also in the rotating-wave approximation) to the form,

We will take g and ω to be positive, since the relative

ˆH is insigniﬁcant.

III. TWO-MODE MEAN-FIELD THEORY IN THE
BLOCH REPRESENTATION

The conventional wavefunction formalisms consider
the evolution of ˆaj and its expectation value in a
symmetry-breaking ansatz (where the symmetry being
broken is that associated with conservation of N ).
In-
stead, we will examine the evolution of the directly ob-
servable quantities ˆa†
i ˆaj, whose expectation values de-
ﬁne the reduced single particle density matrix (SPDM)
/N . Writing the Hamiltonian of Eq. (7) in

(c)κ = 2Ω, and (d)κ = 20Ω.

In Fig. 2 we plot mean-ﬁeld trajectories at four diﬀer-
ent κ/Ω ratios. The nonlinear Bloch equations (14) de-
pict a competition between linear Rabi oscillations in the
sysz-plane and nonlinear oscillations in the sxsy-plane.
For a noninteracting condensate (Fig. 2a) the trajecto-
ries on the Bloch sphere depict harmonic Rabi oscillations
about the sx axis. As κ increases the oscillations become
increasingly anharmonic. As long as κ < Ω the nonlinear-
ities may be treated as perturbation. However, above the
critical value κ = ω (Fig. 2b), there are certain regions
in phase-space which are dominated by the nonlinear
term. The stationary point ~s = (
1, 0, 0), correspond-
ing to the Josephson π-state (equal populations and a π
phase-diﬀerence), becomes dynamically unstable and the
two trajectories passing asymptotically close to it form
a “ﬁgure-eight”. The region outside these limiting tra-
jectories is dominated by the linear oscillations whereas
inside the nonlinear term prevails. Starting at the criti-
cal value of κ = 2Ω (Fig. 2c) population prepared in one
of the modes remains trapped in the half-sphere it origi-
nated from, conducting oscillations with a non-vanishing
time averaged population imbalance

nomenon was termed “macroscopic self-trapping” [6]. Fi-

Equations (19) are solved numerically, using a Runge-
Kutta algorithm. In ﬁg. 3 we plot exact quantum trajec-
tories starting with all particles in one mode, for increas-
ingly large N (κ being ﬁxed) versus the corresponding
mean-ﬁeld trajectory. While MFT assumes a persistently
pure single particle state, quantum corrections to MFT
appear in the single-particle picture, as decoherence of
the SPDM. When the mean-ﬁeld trajectory stays away
from the instability (Fig. 3a) the quantum trajectories
indeed enter the interior of the unit Bloch sphere at a rate
that vanishes as 1/√N . However, when the mean-ﬁeld
trajectory includes the unstable state (Fig. 3b), we ob-
serve a sharp break of the quantum dynamics from the
mean-ﬁeld trajectory at a time that only grows slowly
with N .

In accordance with our picture of quantum corrections
as decoherence, and in order to obtain a more quantita-
tive view of the entanglement-induced dephasing process,
we plot the von Neumann entropy

of the exact reduced single-particle density operator, as
a function of the rescaled time Ωt for the same initial
conditions as in Fig. 3. The results are shown in Fig.
4. Since the entropy of mean-ﬁeld trajectories is identi-
cally zero, S may serve as a measure of the deviation from
MFT. When the mean-ﬁeld trajectory is stable (Fig. 4a),
the single particle entropy grows at a steady rate which
vanishes as N is increased. The variations in the en-
tropy growth curve are a function of the distance from
the instability. Near the instability (Fig. 4b) quantum
corrections grow rapidly at a rate which is independent of
N, and the time at which this divergence takes place (the
quantum break time) evidently grows only as log(N ).

ticles in one mode, with N = 50 (—–), 100 (− − −), 200 (· · ·)
and 400 (− · −) particles vs. the corresponding mean-ﬁeld
trajectory (—–) for (a) κ = Ω and (b) κ = 2Ω.

Since MFT can thus easily fail near dynamical insta-
bilities, it is highly desirable to obtain an improved the-
ory in which Bloch-space trajectories would be allowed to
penetrate into the unit sphere without having to simulate
the entire N -body dynamics. In fact, such an improved
non-unitary theory is easily derived using the next level
of the BBGKY hierarchy (11). This hierarchy trunca-
tion approach is in fact a systematic perturbative ap-
proximation; but it is state-dependent. That is, it pro-
vides a perturbative approximation, not to the general
evolution, but to the evolution of a special class of ini-
tial states, within which the perturbative parameter is
small. In the case of ultracold bosons, the phenomenon of
Bose-Einstein condensation ensures that there is a com-
monly realisable class of states in which the system is a
mildly fragmented condensate. In our two mode model,
this means that the two eigenvalues of R are f and 1-f
for f
1; and so from such initial states we can approx-
imate the evolution perturbatively using f as our small
parameter.

Equations (23) will be referred to as the “Bogoliubov
backreaction equations” (BBR), because they demon-
strate how the mean-ﬁeld Bloch vector ~s drives the ﬂuc-
tuations ∆ij – which is the physics described by the
Bogoliubov theory of linearized quantum corrections to
MFT; but they also make the Bloch vector subject in
turn to backreaction from the ﬂuctuations, via the cou-
κ∆yz/2 and κ∆xz/2. This back-reaction
pling terms
has the eﬀect of breaking the unitarity of the mean-ﬁeld
dynamics. Consequently, the BBR trajectories are no
longer conﬁned to the surface of the Bloch sphere, but
penetrate to the interior (representing mixed-state Rij,
with two non-zero eigenvalues). (Obviously, if the trajec-
tories penetrate the sphere too deeply, so that the smaller
eigenvalue f ceases to be small, the entire approach of
perturbing in f will break down.)

In order to demonstrate how the BBR equations (23)
improve on MFT, we compare trajectories obtained by
these two formalisms to the exact 50-particle trajectories

of Fig. 3. Both the κ = Ω stable mean-ﬁeld trajectory
and the κ = 2Ω unstable mean-ﬁeld trajectory cases are
plotted in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, respectively. The initial
conditions for the BBR equations are determined by the

The approximation of Eq. (22) ignores terms smaller
(f 3/2). It is therefore better than the mean-ﬁeld
than
approximation (12) by a factor of f 1/2. Consequently, as
is clearly evident from Fig. 5a, the BBR equations (23)
are far more successful than the mean-ﬁeld equations (14)

6

in tracing the full quantum dynamics. However, for any
realistic number of particles, the improvement is hardly
necessary, as MFT would be accurate for very long times.
On the other hand, when the mean-ﬁeld trajectory ap-
proaches the instability (Fig. 5b), the BBR theory pro-
vides an accurate prediction of the leading quantum cor-
rections. Of course, since the BBR equations account for
only six moments unobserved by MFT, the period of the
still quasiperiodic BBR motion is shorter than that of
the exact evolution and the BBR trajectory eventually
deviates from the quantum trajectory. Nevertheless, the
BBR formalism provides a simple and eﬃcient method to
predict the quantum break time in large (> 1000 parti-
cles) condensates, for which full N -body simulations are
restricted by available computation power.

The BBR equations (23) are in fact identical to the
equations of motion one would obtain,
for the same
quantities, using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Gaussian
ansatz, in which second-order moments ∆ij are initially
factorized as ∆ij = δiδj (i, j = x, y, z). Using this ansatz,
the factorization persists and the time evolution of δx, δy,
and δz is equivalent to that of perturbations of the mean-
ﬁeld equations (14):

for example, cause phase diﬀusion [16] at a rate Γ pro-
portional to the thermal cloud temperature. For internal
states not entangled with the condensate spatial state, Γ
may be as low as 10−5 Hz under the coldest experimen-
tal conditions, whereas for a double well the rate may
reach 10−1 Hz. Further sources of decoherence may be
described phenomenologically with a larger Γ.

We account eﬀect of thermal noise on the two-mode
dynamics by using the quantum kinetic master equation

Once again, we solve for ~s(t) using either one of three

methods:
(a) MFT - The decoherence term in Eq. (26) introduces
an exact T2 = 1/Γ transversal relaxation term into the
mean-ﬁeld equations of motion:

(b) BBR - Evolving the ﬁrst- and second-order oper-
ators according to Eq.
(26), taking their expectation
values and truncating the hierarchy at the next level, we
obtain the modiﬁed BBR equations,

Thus our equations for ∆ij are in a sense equivalent to the
usual Bogoliubov equations. The quantitative advantage
of our approach therefore lies entirely in the wider range
of initial conditions that it admits, which may more accu-
rately represent the exact initial conditions. For instance,
a Gaussian approximation will have ∆xx =
(1) in the
O
(N −1). This leads to
ground state, where in fact ∆xx =
an error of order N −1/2 in the Josephson frequency com-
puted by linearizing (23) around the ground state, even
though the Gaussian backreaction result should naively
be accurate at this order. Our SPDM approach does not
have this ﬂaw, which is presumably the two-mode version
of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov spectral gap [14].

V. DEPHASING DUE TO THERMAL NOISE

Decoherence is generally considered as suppressing
quantum eﬀects [15].
Ironically, in our case the lead-
ing quantum corrections to the eﬀectively classical MFT,
are themselves decoherence of the single-particle state of
the condensate. Therefore, it is interesting to study the
eﬀect of a realistic decoherence process, originating in the
coupling to a bath of unobserved degrees of freedom, on
the interparticle entanglement process, described in the
previous section.

The main source of decoherence in BEC’s is the ther-
mal cloud of particles surrounding the condensate. Ther-
mal particles scattering oﬀ the condensate mean ﬁeld will

propagating the full N -particle density matrix under Eq.
(26).

In Fig. 6 we compare the Von-Neumann entropy of
the exact N -body density operator as a function of time
for exponentially increasing N , to the mean-ﬁeld entropy.
Due to the thermal noise, mean-ﬁeld trajectories are no
longer conﬁned to the zero-entropy sphere. However,
whereas the quantum break time in the absence of ther-
mal noise has grown as log(N ) (see Fig. 4b), it is clear
from Fig. 6 that in the presence of this dephasing mech-
anism it saturates to a ﬁnite value. Thus, while we may

have naively expected decoherence to reduce quantum
corrections and thereby improve MFT, in fact the ad-
dition of thermal dephasing has signiﬁcantly damaged
classical-quantum correspondence.

and 640 (. . .) particles. Bold solid curve corresponds to the
mean ﬁeld entropy. Initial conditions are the same as in Fig.
3.

In Fig. 7, we summarize the results of numerous dy-
namical calculations conducted for various values of the
particle number N and of the thermal noise Γ, by plotting
the time at which the entropy reaches a given value. The
curves are obtained using the modiﬁed BBR equations
(28) whereas the circles and squares depict exact quan-
103
tum results (limited by computation power to N
particles) for two limiting values of Γ. The BBR equa-
tions provide accurate predictions of the initial decoher-
ence rate and the quantum break time even within this
limited range of N (and the agreement between the exact
quantum results and the BBR predictions would become
still better for higher numbers of particles). Once more,
we observe the logarithmic growth of the quantum break
time with N in the zero temperature (Γ = 0) limit. How-
ever, when the temperature is ﬁnite, there is a saturation
of the quantum break time to values which are well be-
low the mean-ﬁeld thermal dephasing times, in agreement
with Fig. 6.

∼

Instead of observing the quantum break time as a func-
tion of the number of particles for a given degree of ther-
mal noise, we can monitor the thermal decoherence time
as a function of temperature, for any given number of
particles. Viewing Fig. 7 this way, it is evident that
in the mean-ﬁeld limit (1/√N
0) the purely thermal
dephasing time also grows only logarithmically with the
temperature, Comparing this result to the log(N ) growth

of the quantum break time in the zero-temperature limit,
we can see that thermal noise and quantum noise have es-
sentially similar eﬀects on the system. And Figs. 6 and
7 together are in complete agreement with the prediction
that the entropy of a dynamically unstable quantum sys-
tem coupled to a reservoir [17], or of a stable system
coupled to a dynamically unstable reservoir, will grow
linearly with time, at a rate independent of the system-
reservoir coupling, after an onset time proportional to the
logarithm of the coupling [18,19]. Thus, one can really
consider the Bogoliubov ﬂuctuations as a reservoir [20],
coupled to the mean ﬁeld with a strength proportional to
1/N . The N
1/T analogy is even further extended by
the saturation for any ﬁnite N , of the thermal dephas-
ing time at low T , in the same way that the quantum
break time for a ﬁnite T saturates at high N . Due to
this quantum saturation, quantum corrections can be ex-
perimentally distinguished from ordinary thermal eﬀects
which do not saturate the dephasing rate at low temper-
ature.

VI. SCATTERING-LENGTH MEASUREMENTS

After indicating how condensate decoherence at dy-
namical instabilities can connect principles established
in diﬀerent areas of physics, we brieﬂy note that it can
also have practical applications. Rapid decoherence in
the vicinity of the unstable π-state of the two-mode con-
densate may serve for the direct measurement of scatter-
ing lengths. As demonstrated in Fig. 8, the mean-ﬁeld

quantum break time. By applying to condensate physics
some insights from studies of decoherence, we have found
evidence that MFT dynamical instabilities cause linear
growth of the single-particle entropy at a rate indepen-
dent of N. And from condensate physics we have learned
something about decoherence: we have identiﬁed a form
of decoherence which degrades quantum-classical corre-
spondence, instead of improving it.

trajectory of a condensate which is prepared initially in
one of the modes, would only pass through the rapidly
dephasing unstable point when κ = 2Ω. Thus, the self-
interactions energy κ can be determined by measuring
the entropy at a ﬁxed time as a function of the coupling
frequency Ω, resulting in a sharp line about Ω = κ/2, as
depicted in Fig. 9.

Experimentally, the single-particle entropy is measur-
able, in the internal state realization of our model, by
applying a fast Rabi pulse and measuring the amplitude
of the ensuing Rabi oscillations, which is proportional to

the dependence on the angle of ~s). In a double well real-
ization, one could determine the single-particle entropy
by lowering the potential barrier, at a moment when the
populations on each side were predicted to be equal, to
let the two parts of the condensate interfere. The fringe
visibility would then be proportional to

VII. CONCLUSIONS

To conclude, we have shown that signiﬁcant quantum
corrections to the Gross-Pitaevskii MFT, in the vicin-
ity of its dynamical instabilities, can be measured in a
two-mode BEC under currently achievable experimental
conditions. We have derived a simple theory that accu-
rately predicts the leading quantum corrections and the

Our picture of quantum backreaction in BECs as de-
coherence suggests new lines of investigation for both
experiment and theory: measurements of single-particle
entropy in condensates, descriptions of condensates with
mixed single particle states (instead of the usual macro-
scopic wave functions), and general questions of deco-
herence under nonlinear evolution. Exploring these pos-
sibilities, beyond the two-mode model considered here,
provides many goals for further research.

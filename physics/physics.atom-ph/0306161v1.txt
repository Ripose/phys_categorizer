Abstract. Chiral Perturbation Theory predicts the lifetime of pionium, a hydrogen-
like π+π− atom, to better than 3% precision. The goal of the DIRAC experiment at
CERN is to obtain and check this value experimentally by measuring the break-up
probability of pionium in a target. In order to accurately measure the lifetime one
needs to know the relationship between the break-up probability and lifetime to a
1% accuracy. We have obtained this dependence by modeling the evolution of pionic
atoms in the target using Monte Carlo methods. The model relies on the computation
of the pionium–target atom interaction cross sections. Three diﬀerent sets of pionium–
target cross sections with varying degrees of complexity were used: from the simplest
ﬁrst order Born approximation involving only the electrostatic interaction to a more
advanced approach taking into account multi-photon exchanges and relativistic eﬀects.
We conclude that in order to obtain the pionium lifetime to 1% accuracy from the
break-up probability, the pionium–target cross sections must be known with the same
accuracy for the low excited bound states of the pionic atom. This result has been
achieved, for low Z targets, with the two most precise cross section sets. For large Z
targets only the set accounting for multiphoton exchange satisﬁes the condition.

1. Introduction

Pionium is the hydrogen-like electromagnetic bound state of a π+π− pair. Its lifetime
is determined by the strong π+π− → π0π0 annihilation in the low relative momentum
regime where Chiral Perturbation Theory applies. The theory predicts the pionium
lifetime value of (2.9 ± 0.1) × 10−15 s [1]. Experimentally, this value is being measured
in a model-independent way by the DIRAC experiment at CERN [2].

Under the experimental conditions of DIRAC the pionic atoms are created in the
inelastic scattering between 24 GeV/c protons, supplied by the PS at CERN, and the
nuclei of the target [3, 4], a chemically pure material of well-determined thickness.

A pionic atom propagating at relativistic speed inside the target interacts mainly
electromagnetically with the target atoms. The electromagnetic cross section is on the
order of a megabarn. These interactions can lead either to a transition between two
bound states of pionium or to a dissociation (break-up). The scattering with the target
atoms competes with the process of annihilation since a shorter pionium lifetime leads
to a smaller break-up probability.

The main thrust of DIRAC’s experimental technique is the detection of π+π− pairs
with very low relative momentum. From the low-momentum part of the spectrum, the
break-up probability of pionium is then determined.

The goal of this study is to establish the theoretical dependence of the break-up
probability on the lifetime with a very high accuracy. We modeled the dynamics of
pionium in diﬀerent targets taking into account a large number of atomic shells that
become populated as the pionic atom evolves in the target.

We have performed the calculations by using three sets of pionium target interaction
cross sections. The original studies by Afanasyev and Tarasov [5] made use of the Born
approximation and pure electrostatic interaction.
In our work we have applied new
corrected cross sections that take into account relativistic eﬀects [6] and the multiphoton
exchanges [7]. In addition, these cross section sets include a more accurate description
of the target atomic form factor. As an error in the break-up probability translates
directly to an error in lifetime, we have checked whether the results obtained in the new
calculations signiﬁcantly deviate from the previous ones. We conclude that the magnetic
and relativistic corrections together with the target form factor choice are non-negligible
mainly for the small Z targets, whereas the multiphoton exchange should be considered
for the large Z ones.

2. Monte Carlo Simulation of Pionium in the Target

As we have noted in the introduction, to determine the pionium lifetime, the experiment
DIRAC needs a precise theoretical calculation of the break-up probability Pbr of pionium
due to the electromagnetic interaction with target atoms. This calculation can be done
by means of a Monte Carlo transport code that simulates the evolution of pionium
from its creation to either its annihilation or its break-up under the given experimental

conditions.

2.1. Pionium Production

The pionic atoms are formed as a consequence of the Coulomb ﬁnal state interaction
of two oppositely charged pions. These pions are created in an inelastic collision of
a 24 GeV/c proton and one of the target nuclei. The pionic atom is described by six
quantities, accounting for the six degrees of freedom of a two body system. A particularly
convenient choice of these quantities is given by the laboratory momentum of the center
of mass of the atom ~P and the quantum numbers of the created bound state n, l, and
m in the spherical coordinate representation ‡.

The probability of pionium being created is given by [3]

The two terms on the right-hand side of the equation illustrate the ﬁnal state interaction
mechanism. The rightmost factor is the doubly inclusive cross section of π+ and π− pairs
at equal momenta (~p = ~q) without considering the ﬁnal state interaction, as indicated by
the superscript 0. The subscript s means that only pions created from direct hadronic
processes and decays of resonances with a very short lifetime are considered, because
the Coulomb interaction of pions from long-lived sources (e.g. η, K 0
S and Λ) is negligible
and hence they do not contribute to pionic atoms production. The eﬀect of the ﬁnal
state Coulomb interaction is to create a bound state with quantum numbers n, l, and
m; it is given by the squared wave function at the origin.

The doubly inclusive cross section can be obtained from the direct measurements

of time correlated π+π− pairs in DIRAC, according to the following reasoning:

• The ﬁnal state Coulomb interaction for short-lived sources is given, as in the case of
the creation of a bound state, by a multiplicative factor depending only on Q, the
magnitude of the relative momentum between the two pions. This is the so-called
Coulomb or Gamow factor [9]

• The contribution to the doubly inclusive cross section of pairs containing at least
one pion from a long-lived source, ωl( ~P ), can be calculated with a hadron physics
Monte Carlo simulation. In our case we have used FRITIOF6 [10]. This function
has been shown to depend only on P [11], the magnitude of the total momentum

The initial quantum number distribution depends on the value of the wave function
at the origin. It has been shown [12] that the eﬀect of the strong interaction between
the two pions of the atom signiﬁcantly modiﬁes |ψnlm(0)| in comparison to the pure
Coulomb wave function. However, the ratio between the production rate in diﬀerent
states has been demonstrated to be kept as for the Coulomb wave functions [13]. Then,
considering that the Coulomb functions obey

Another quantity to be speciﬁed is the position where the proton–target interaction
took place ( ~R). This is also the position where the atom was created. Since the
target thickness is chosen much smaller than the nuclear interaction length of the target
material, the π+π− atoms are supposed to be uniformly generated all across the target
thickness. The position in the transverse coordinates is unimportant, but it can be
generated according to the beam proﬁle characteristics, too.

We have now gathered all the information needed to simulate the creation of
pionium atoms with a center of mass momentum ~P according to the experimentally
measured momentum and angular distributions, at a position ~R uniformly distributed
through the target, and in an initial S-wave state with the principal quantum number
n distributed according to a 1/n3 distribution.

2.2. Pionium Annihilation

Once an atom has been created in its initial state, speciﬁed by ~P , n, l, and m, its
dynamics are those of a free system that can either be annihilated, mainly via the
π+π− → π0π0 channel, or be electromagnetically scattered by one of the target atoms.

Note, however, that due to (5) pionium may only decay from S states. Moreover, the
lifetime of any S state is related to the lifetime of the ground state, by

τn00 = n3τ.

For the purpose of simulating pionium in the target, we shall from now on refer to τ as
the pionium lifetime.

2.3. Electromagnetic Interaction of Pionium with the Target

Finally, the total cross section gives the probability of an atom to undergo an

electromagnetic interaction and of course fulﬁlls

The total probability for a pionic atom to suﬀer an electromagnetic collision per unit
length is then given by

where λem
nlm is the mean free path before an electromagnetic interaction takes place.
Exploiting the completeness of the eigenstates of the Coulomb Hamiltonian the total
electromagnetic cross sections can be calculated directly [15, 16] and not just via (12) §.
The electromagnetic cross sections have been obtained with diﬀerent approaches
in [5, 6, 7]. We will devote section 5 to discussing the diﬀerent break-up probabilities
they lead to.

To get an insight into the magnitude of these interaction probabilities we show
in ﬁgure 2 the average values of the annihilation, ionization, excitation and de-excitation
probabilities per unit length. The average is taken over the even z-parity states (i.e.,
l − m even) for ﬁxed n. The atoms are created in even z-parity states (l = m = 0)
and the transitions to odd z-parity ones are strongly suppressed. The ﬁgure shows the
probabilities using the coherent (interaction with the atom as a whole) contribution of
the Born2 set of cross sections. This cross section set will be described in section 4.
Any other choice among the cross section sets described in section 4 would lead to very
similar results. The averages are deﬁned as

2.4. Pionium Evolution in the Target

To simulate the evolution of a pionic atom we use the following algorithm:
(i) We generate a laboratory momentum ~P , an initial set of quantum numbers and an

initial position ~R for the atom as described in subsection 2.1.

(ii) We generate a free path according to:

(iv) We determine whether the atom has been annihilated, excited (or de-excited) in a
discrete collision, or broken up. The relative weights of the respective branches of
the evolution are given by the probabilities of equations (9), (10), and (11).

(v) If the atom has been scattered and suﬀered a discrete transition we return to step
(ii) using the new quantum numbers n′, l′ and m′ and the new position ~R′ as the
initial values.

More details on this model may be found in [17].

3. Break-up Probability Calculation

In principle, the break-up probability calculation of pionium should be straightforward
once we have established the Monte Carlo model. The rest would be a matter of

m
A Monte Carlo Calculation of the Pionium Break-up Probability

generating an atom sample and computing how many of them break up in the target.
However, two main diﬃculties arise when trying to implement the algorithm.

The ﬁrst diﬃculty is due to the presence of an inﬁnite number of atomic bound
states in the calculations. Clearly, only a ﬁnite number of states can be taken into
account in the simulation of the evolution of pionium.
In our calculations we have
imposed a cut on the states with n ≤ nmax. This would not pose a serious problem
if the atoms, being created mainly in very low n states, could not get highly excited.
Unfortunately, excitation to ever higher lying bound states constitutes a major branch
in the evolution of pionium. As a consequence we cannot directly calculate the break-up
probability as outlined in the previous paragraph.

The other diﬃculty lies in the fact that for some of the cross section sets to be
studied in section 4, the break-up cross sections have not been calculated. In this case
it is imperative to ﬁnd an indirect way to compute the break-up probability.

We have discussed in the previous section that pionium terminates its evolution in
the target by being either annihilated or broken up. However, the atom can also leave
the target in a bound state. This would happen if one of the generated free paths in
the Monte Carlo procedure carries it to a position outside the target. The break-up
probability (Pbr), the annihilation probability (Panh), and the probability to leave the
target in a discrete state (Pdsc) are related by:

1 = Pbr + Panh + Pdsc .

(20)

This equation allows us to compute the break-up probability indirectly.

3.1. Computation Diﬃculties Due to Physical Characteristics of the Problem

The probability to generate an atom in a speciﬁc shell decreases as 1/n3. This means
that the number of atoms created with n ≥ 4 is very small. If the atoms could not
get excited to states with large n, we could safely solve the evolution system by setting
nmax > 4. However, as we saw in ﬁgure 2, the atoms have a tendency to be excited, as
n increases, rather than being annihilated or ionized.

Hence we expect a signiﬁcant fraction of atoms excited into n > nmax shells even
for large values of nmax. The probability of an atom in a nlm state to be excited into a
state beyond the cut, i.e. with n > nmax, is given by

pn′>nmax

nlm

= pem

nlm − pbr

nlm −

pn′l′m′

nlm

(21)

Xn′≤nmax, l′m′
where we have used (10), (11) and (13). However, once the atom jumps into one of
these states we loose control over it and we have to stop its evolution.

To analyze the change of the Monte Carlo results with nmax we have modeled the
evolution of a sample of atoms by changing nmax from 7 to 9. We observed three main
eﬀects:

• The fraction of annihilated atoms (Panh(n ≤ nmax)) does not change signiﬁcantly.

A Monte Carlo Calculation of the Pionium Break-up Probability

9

• The portion of atoms leaving the target in discrete states (Pdsc(n ≤ nmax)) changes

only slightly.

• The fraction of dissociated atoms (Pbr(n ≤ nmax)) changes signiﬁcantly.

This eﬀect can be understood by checking the dependence of the annihilation, the
discrete and the break-up probabilities on n, the principal quantum number of the
state from which the atom was annihilated, broken-up, or in which it left the target.
In ﬁgure 3 we show the result of the Monte-Carlo simulation with nmax = 8 for a sample
of one million atoms using the Born2 cross section set that also includes cross sections for
the ionization (refer to section 4). For the annihilated atoms we can see that Panh(n) is
negligible for values of n & 4. The Pdsc(n) dependence also shows a fast, but less drastic,
decrease with n. Only the solution for the states with n = nmax − 1 or n = nmax − 2
is unstable under variation of nmax. For nmax = 8 this is a small contribution to the
total Pdsc value. Finally, Pbr(n) decreases very slowly with n, showing that there is a
signiﬁcant fraction of atoms broken up from states with n > nmax. The probability of
an atom to be excited into such a state with n > nmax is also shown as a function of the
principal quantum number of the last state before the excitation. Obviously, this eﬀect
is non-negligible.

For the cross section sets without break-up cross sections, we can calculate directly
only the total probability for all electromagnetic processes and the probabilities for
discrete transitions to states with n′ < nmax.
In these cases we can therefore not
distinguish whether an atom has been broken up or excited into a state with n′ > nmax,
that is, we can only determine the combination of probabilities
nlm = pem

pn′>nmax

pn′l′m′
nlm .

+ pbr

nlm

This is, of course, equivalent to (21), but in this case pbr
nlm is unknown. Thus, for these
cross section sets not even the break-up probability for low n states could be directly
calculated and we are forced to use the procedure described below.

Xn′≤nmax, l′m′

3.2. Calculation Procedure

Based on the fast decrease of Panh and Pdsc as a function of n we can assume that
almost every atom excited to a state n > nmax will be eventually broken up. This will
be true even though the excitation probability per unit length of a given bound state
is signiﬁcantly larger than the break-up probability per unit length. We can explain it
as follows. The mean free path of the excited atoms strongly decreases with increasing
n. For n ∼ 8 the mean free path is . 0.1 µm. An excited atom will thus interact
many times within a very short distance. In every scattering the atom will have some
small probability to break up, thereby terminating its evolution. In summary, the most
probable evolution of an atom that has been excited to any state with n & 4 is a
sequence of excitations (and less frequent de-excitations) terminated by break-up.

excited into a non-controlled state with n > 8. The results are for pionium in a
95 µm Ni target and the lifetime is assumed to be 3 · 10−15 s.

However, while we are neglecting the atomic annihilation from states with n > 8
and thus setting Panh = Panh(n ≤ 8), we can estimate Pdsc(n > 8) by means of a ﬁt to
the Pdsc(n) histogram as recommended in [5]

Pdsc(n > 8) =

a

n5 .

Hence, taking into account (20) we obtain

Pbr = 1 − Pdsc − Panh,

where Pdsc consists of two parts,

Pdsc = Pdsc(n ≤ 8) + Pdsc(n > 8),

(23)

(24)

(25)

of which Pdsc(n ≤ 8) is computed directly and Pdsc(n > 8) is calculated from (23). In
this manner we can calculate the break-up probability even without ionization cross
sections as input.

In table 1 and in ﬁgure 4 (top left) we show a few results for the probability for
diﬀerent lifetime values in a 95 µm Ni target. The target choice coincides with that of
the DIRAC experiment. We observe that the result of Pdsc(n > 8) adds only a small
correction. In ﬁgure 4 we also show the ionization and annihilation distributions as a

managed to emerge from the target in a bound state. As emphasized in subsection 3.1,
with increasing n only the atoms very near the target end will be able to leave the target
in a discrete state.

4. Cross Sections Sets

In our calculations of the break-up probability we employed three diﬀerent sets of cross
sections. The ﬁrst two have been calculated in the framework of the Born approximation.
We assign the labels Born1 to the calculations made in reference [5] and Born2 to those
of [6]. The two sets diﬀer in four main points:

• The Born1 set neglects the contribution of incoherent scattering (collisions leading
to an excitation of the target atom), thus considering the coherent interaction only
(collisions with the target atom as a whole), i.e. the leading term. By contrast the
Born2 set accounts for target excitations.

• The Born1 set uses Moli`ere’s parameterization [18] for the Thomas-Fermi equation
solution as the target atom form factor of the pure electric interaction, whereas the
Born2 set takes electron orbitals determined numerically within the Hartree-Fock
framework for the same purpose. The Thomas-Fermi-Moli`ere parameterization of
the atomic form factor is accurate for low momentum exchange, but gives a small
excess for harder scattering.

• The Born1 set considers the sudden approximation (no recoil energy for the target
and the pionic atom) and neglects the energy diﬀerence between the initial and the
ﬁnal state, while the Born2 set accounts for these two eﬀects.

• Finally, Born2 set also considers the eﬀect of magnetic and relativistic terms.

In principle it has been concluded [6] that accounting for second order eﬀects
like the magnetic terms of the Hamiltonian, the recoil energy of the atoms, or the
relativistic terms generally leads to an overall decrease of the sudden approximation pure

electrostatic coherent cross section value due to destructive interference with the leading
orders. Moreover, employing atomic orbitals obtained in the Hartree-Fock approach for
the form factor used to compute these cross sections leads to lower values than those of
the Born1 set since the Moli`ere parameterization of the solution to the Thomas-Fermi
equation is excessive for mean and large values of the photon momentum transfer. This
last issue leads to discrepancies that increase for large n states and decrease for large
Z target atoms. The diﬀerence appears to be balanced by neglecting the incoherent
contribution to the cross section in the Born1. This results in a systematically smaller
ground state cross section of Born1 set whereas for larger n Born1 cross sections are
larger (up to ∼ 10% discrepancy) or compatible with Born2 results. We can observe the
comparison for three target materials in ﬁgure 5 and we shall analyze the disagreement
in the break-up probability resulting from this eﬀect.

Figure 5.
In the left column we compare the Born1 and Born2 cross section sets.
The middle column shows a comparison of the Born1 and Glauber sets and ﬁnally
on the right we compare the Born2 and Glauber sets. The comparison is made for
Titanium (Z = 22), Nickel (Z = 28) and Platinum (Z = 78). The plots refer to total
electromagnetic cross sections averaged over m for even z-parity states.

Finally we have also used a set of cross sections where the Glauber formalism has
been applied to calculate the coherent contribution to the cross section value. The details
are given in [7]. This calculation technique accounts for multi-photon exchange in the
pionium–target atom collision. Contrary to what one would expect the consideration
of more than one photon being exchanged diminishes the values of the cross sections
due to a destructive interference of the n-photon exchange contributions (this happened
also when accounting for magnetic terms in the Born2 set). The leading order of the
Glauber result matches the sudden approximation of the Born cross sections (since both

neglect the diﬀerence between the initial and the ﬁnal state energies). However, this
cross section set uses a parameterization for the target atom form factors similar to the
ones used in Born2. This explains the disagreement with respect to the Born1 and the
agreement with Born2 set for low Z targets, as can be seen in ﬁgure 5. The corrections
due to multiphoton exchange are important for large Z targets [7] and this explains the
large discrepancies obtained for Platinum.

5. Results and Conclusions

After the discussions of the previous sections, we ﬁnally present the results of the break-
up probability calculation. The DIRAC experiment has the possibility of choosing
between several targets. The design of these diﬀerent targets has been made to achieve
the maximum break-up probability resolution in diﬀerent lifetime ranges. Large Z
targets with larger interaction cross sections are better suited for small lifetime values
whereas lower Z materials are more sensitive to larger lifetime values. Three of these
targets are the Pt 28 µm target, suitable for lifetime ranges τ < 1 · 10−15 s, the Ni
95 µm target for τ ∼ 3 · 10−15 s and the Ti 251 µm target for τ ∼ 4 · 10−15 s. The
target thickness was chosen so as to have the same radiation length and hence equivalent
multiple scattering eﬀects for all three targets. The Nickel target constitutes DIRAC’s
main target with which 90% of the data have been collected, as it is optimal for the
theoretically predicted lifetime value.

In ﬁgure 6 the break-up probability curves are shown for these three targets. The
calculation has been carried out for samples of ten million events, with a statistical error
less than 0.08%.

One can clearly see that for the Ti and Ni targets the Glauber and Born2 sets
lead to similar results whereas the Born1 set shows a ∼ 8% disagreement. For the
large Z target (Pt) both Born1 and Born2 are biased toward large values. In this case,

the multi-photon contributions to the total cross sections are not negligible.
case the discrepancies between the break-up probability results are at the level of the
discrepancies between ground state cross sections and much smaller than the diﬀerences
between cross sections sets for medium or highly excited states. We can understand this
based on the fact that the probability for the atoms to leave the target in a discrete
state other than the ground state and maybe the ﬁrst excited shell Pdsc(n & 2) is of
the order of, or smaller than, 5%. Hence, even large uncertainties in this magnitude
(up to 10 − 15%) lead to very small changes in the break-up probability result. Only
discrepancies in the ground state population and maybe the ﬁrst excited shell, where
most of the atoms are created, would lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the break-up
probability results of the diﬀerent sets.

Graphically we can view the atom as a balloon being inﬂated in every collision with
the target. The diﬀerent sets will lead to similar results of the size increase rate as long
as the atom remains in a low excited state. However, as the atom grows (inﬂates) it
will no longer be able to advance as easily in the target due to its large size and will

ﬁnally break-up (explode). Large discrepancies in the excitation and break-up rate of
the excited atom will not be important given that the mean free paths for the excited
states are very small compared to the target dimensions.

In summary, we recall that the high precision measurement attempted by the
DIRAC collaboration also requires an accuracy to better than 1% in our theoretical
break-up probability calculations. We note that the seemingly large discrepancies
among our diﬀerent cross section sets particularly for pionium transitions starting from
highly excited states do not lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the theoretical break-
up probabilities. The discrepancies between break-up probabilities are coming almost
entirely from diﬀerences in the cross sections for the lowest lying states, where both
the atomic structure of the target and the multi-photon transitions need to be treated
as accurately as possible. This challenge, however, has already been mastered in our
previous works [6, 16] where we showed that the required 1% accuracy can be achieved
with our calculations, albeit only with the Born2 and the Glauber sets for low Z and
with the Glauber set for large Z targets. The important conclusion of the present
investigation is the ﬁnding that the (inﬁnitely many!) highly excited states of pionium
do not limit the validity of our approach even though we can include explicitly only a
moderate number of these states in our simulations.

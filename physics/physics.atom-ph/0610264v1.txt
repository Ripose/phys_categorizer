Abstract

Radiation from the highly-charged ions contained in the plasma of Electron-
Cyclotron Resonance Ion Sources constitutes a very bright source of X-rays. Because
the ions have a relatively low kinetic energy (≈ 1 eV) transitions can be very nar-
row, containing only a small Doppler broadening. We describe preliminary accurate
measurements of two and three-electron ions with Z = 16–18. We show how these
measurement can test sensitively many-body relativistic calculations or can be used
as X-ray standards for precise measurements of X-ray transitions in exotic atoms.

Key words: X-ray spectroscopy, Exotic atoms, ECR ion source, highly charged ions.

and advanced atomic calculations
[1]. Yet all this considerable work
does not allow for precise-enough
tests of QED and relativistic eﬀects
in high ﬁelds, when the speed of the
electron Zαc and the strength of the
coupling with the nuclear charge Zα
start to get large (α is the ﬁne struc-
ture constant, c is the speed of light
and Z the atomic number). Lamb
shift values have been extracted
from experimental Kα line energies
up to Z = 100 [2], but neither the
theoretical accuracy nor the experi-
mental one allows such data to make
very good tests of QED in high-ﬁeld.
Moreover, because of the complex
nature of inner-shell transitions in
normal atoms, particularly when em-
bedded in a solid matrix, their X-rays
are not as suited as one would like
as X-ray standards. In particular the
lines are broad because of the Auger
eﬀect, deformed because of the outer
shell structure and multivacancies,
and can be shifted because of chemi-
cal shifts and of their dependence on
the excitation energy.

In the last few years, the need of
better X-ray standards has shown
up in a series of experiments, per-
formed at the Paul Scherrer Institute
in Switzerland. The aim of these
experiments was to make accurate
measurements of the charged pion
mass using pionic atoms, and of the
strong interaction shift and broaden-
ing of the 1s level of pionic hydrogen.
Pionic atoms are a speciﬁc example
of exotic atoms, in which a stable
particle (by this we mean a particle
that can live long enough to form
an atom) is bound to a nucleus. For
light elements at least, the cascade

following the capture of the particle,
which is always much heavier than
the electron, leads to a two body sys-
tem, all the electrons being ejected
by Auger eﬀect.

The goal of these experiments was in
one hand to provide a pion mass ac-
curate to ≈ 2 ppm, and in the other
hand to measure the strong interac-
tion broadening of the ground state
level of pionic hydrogen of about 1 eV
to an accuracy of less than 10 meV,
an order of magnitude better than
previous experiments [3]. Such an ac-
curacy is required to obtain a mean-
ingful test of Chiral Perturbation
theory (ChPT) calculations [4, 5],
an eﬀective ﬁeld theory designed to
perform Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD) calculation at low energy, a
regime in which quark conﬁnement
precludes the use of perturbation
theory in term of the QCD coupling
constant. More recently the interest
of doing similar measurements on
pionic deuterium was pointed out [6]
and the experiment was performed
in the summer of 2006.

The previous measurements of the
charged pion mass were performed by
stopping a pion beam into a solid Mg
target[7] and measuring the energy
of a transition between two circu-
lar, high principal quantum number
levels to avoid inﬂuence from strong
interaction. The pionic magnesium
thus formed was able to recapture
electrons from the solid, leading to
a diﬃcult analysis and to doubts on
the reliability of the results[8, 9, 10].
A ﬁrst experiment using a device
called the Cyclotron Trap [11], de-
signed to slow down beams of exotic

2

particles and stop them in a nitro-
gen gas target, was then performed
by our collaboration to remove this
ambiguity[12]. The Kα spectrum of
copper, in the fourth order of diﬀrac-
tion was used as a X-ray standard.
This contributed noticeably to the ﬁ-
nal error budget. It was then decided
to improve on this experiment by
doing a direct comparison bewteen
the 5g → 4f transitions in muonic
oxygen and pionic nitrogen, which
are very close in energy. A new cy-
clotron trap (Cyclotron Trap II) was
designed to optimize the capture of
muons, which comes from the disin-
tegration of the pions in the trap. A
demonstration of the use of exotic
atom, and a proposal to use highly-
charge ions as X-ray standards was
done in Ref. [13].

The strong interaction shift (≈ 7 eV)
and broadening (≈ 1 eV) in pionic
hydrogen are obtained by measuring
the energy and line shape of X-ray
transitions feeding the atomic 1s
state [14]. The energies of the X-
rays in question are 2.436, 2.886 and
3.043 keV for the 2p→1s, 3p→1s and
4p→1s transitions, respectively. In
order to attain the desired accuracy,
a characterization of the spectrome-
ter was in order, using several lines
of energy close to those three pionic
lines, and of width negligible com-
pared to the best Bragg crystals en-
ergy resolution. It was found that the
so called relativistic M1 transition
1s2s 3S1 → 1s2 1S0 (it has exactly
0 probability in a non-relativistic
model) of sulfur, chlorine and argon
had the exact energy required. More-
over their natural width of a few neV
was completely negligible. It was also

found that the magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration of the improved cyclotron
trap was perfect to turn it into a high-
performance Electron Cyclotron
Resonance ion source (ECRIS). A
single observation of X-ray transi-
tions in helium-like argon had been
performed at that time [15], and it
was clear from the formation mech-
anism of the diﬀerent charge states
that the M1 transition X-ray emis-
sion should be very bright in a high-
performance source [16]. A speciﬁc
set of polar pieces and a permanent-
magnet hexapole were constructed
to enable to turn the cyclotron trap
II into an electron-cyclotron reso-
nance ion trap (ECRIT) [17]. This
device has a very high magnetic ﬁeld
mirror ratio along its axis to improve
the electron conﬁnement,
leading
to very high-performances with a
relatively modest frequency for the
microwave (6.4 GHz) driving the
electron-cyclotron resonance. The
name ECRIT rather than ECRIS
stems from the fact that our aim
was to improve X-ray emission from
the plasma inside the source, not to
extract intense ion beams.

Here we provide a preliminary ac-
count of a new measurement of the
1s2s2p 2PJ → 1s22s 2S1/2 transitions
in lithium-like sulfur, chlorine and
argon, as an example of the accuracy
that can be reached when combining
the ECRIT with a high-performance
spectrometer.

2 Experimental set-up

The experiment uses a Bragg spec-
trometer in Johann mounting [18]
and was equipped with spherically
bent silicon or quartz crystals having
a diameter of 100 mm and a thickness
of 0.3 mm or 0.2 mm, respectively.
They were mounted by optical con-
tact on glass lenses of ultimate qual-
ity. The curvature radius RC of the
bent crystals is RC ≈ 2982 mm and
varies between individual crystals.
These radii have been recently in-
dividually measured to the required
accuracy. For these parameters, bent
crystal theory predicts a negligible
inﬂuence of the bending process on
the crystal’s rocking curve [19].

The experiment (Fig. 1) is composed
of three parts:

• The Electron Cyclotron Reso-
nance Ion Trap (ECRIT) consists
out of a superconducting split
coil magnet, which together with
special iron inserts, provides the
mirror ﬁeld conﬁguration, an Ad-
vanced ECR source - Updated ver-
sion (AECRU-U) style permanent
hexapole magnet and a 6.4 GHz
power regulated microwave emit-
ter [20]. The mirror ﬁeld param-
eters provide one of the highest
mirror ratios for ECR sources with
a value of 4.3 over the length of
the plasma chamber. The plasma
chamber is formed by a 0.4 mm
thick stainless steel tube of inner
diameter of 85 mm and a length
of 265 mm axially limited by cop-
per inserts. At the position of the
hexapole gap the stainless steel

tube is perforated by a series of 2.5
mm diameter holes allowing for
radial pumping in addition to ax-
ial pumping. The microwave high
frequency power is introduced di-
rectly to the plasma chamber with
waveguides exhibiting a small an-
gle to the axis. In this way the
path of the X-rays was at no point
cut by any obstacle which could
distort the shape of the response
function. An extraction voltage of
2 kV had been routinely applied
at the side opposite to the crystal
spectrometer. The total ion cur-
rent was measured as a control for
a stable operation. More details
on the ECRIT can be found in
[17, 21].

A reference pressure (without
plasma) of 1.7 10−7 mbar was
achieved. Gas ﬁlling was supplied
radially by UHV precision leak
valves through the gaps in the
open structure hexapole. The gas
composition was
routinely sur-
veyed with a quadrupole mass
spectrometer. For an optimised
plasma source a drastic increase of
the number of energetic electrons
was discovered which required the
use of a cleaning magnet installed
at a distance of one meter in front
of the crystal.

• A silicon(111) as well as a quartz(10¯1)
crystal were investigated, which
had been recently applied for mea-
suring pionic hydrogen transitions
[22]. The Bragg angles ΘB, corre-
sponding to the M1 transition of
helium-like argon with an energy
of 3.104 keV, are ΘB= 36.68◦ for
the quartz and ΘB=39.57◦ for the
silicon crystal. The crystals were
installed at a distance of 2330 mm

Fig. 1. Set up of the PSI ECRIT together with the Bragg crystal spectrometer

from the centre of the ECRIT re-
sulting in a position of the plasma
about 500 mm outside the Row-
land circle.

• A Charged Coupled Device (CCD)
pixel detector with a pixel size of
40 µm×40 µm and an energy res-
olution of 140 eV at 3 keV was
used to detect the X-rays [23]. The
detector consisted out of six chips
with 600×600 pixels each result-
ing in a total height of 72 mm and
a width of 48 mm. The distance of
the CCD detector from the crystal
could be changed remotely over a
length of 86 mm without breaking
the vacuum.

The CCD detector and the as-
sociated electronics were protected
against light as well as the high fre-

quency stray ﬁeld by a 30 µm thick
beryllium window installed in the
vacuum tube in front of the CCD
cryostat.

3 Results and discussion

With the ECR source a number of
20000 events was reached for the
narrow M1 transition of helium-like
Argon in about 30 minutes time to
be compared with a number of 5000
counts reached after 40 hours with
X-rays from pionic carbon formed
when using methane gas. A total of
about 10 hours was needed, however,
to determine the spectrometer’s re-
sponse function in suﬃcient detail

5

including changes of the distance
CCD detector-crystal (focal scans)
and changing apertures in front of
the crystals. A complete survey of all
Kα transitions for ions from helium-
like to 1+ was performed [24]. In the
present paper, we will foccus on a
preliminary measurement of the en-
ergy diﬀerence between the lithium-
like 1s2s2p 2PJ → 1s22s 2S1/2 and
the helium-like M1 transition, used
as a reference. Preliminary results
for He-like lines have been presented
elsewhere [24, 25]. For the energy
value of this line, we take recent re-
sults from Ref. [26], which includes
all QED corrections known to date.
A complete Monte-Carlo simulation
of the spectrometer is performed,
in order to provide the line proﬁles
to be ﬁtted [21, 25]. An example of
spectra, together with the ﬁt, is pre-
sented on Fig. 2.

In order to interpret the results,
which are of much better accuracy
than all previous measurements, we
have performed Multi-Conﬁguration
Dirac-Fock calculations. In this vari-
ational method the wave-function is
represented as a linear combination
of Slater determinants (conﬁgura-
tions). We use the program of De-
sclaux and Indelicato [27, 28] that
contains ﬁrst and second order QED
self-energy
including
corrections,
screening. This code was used in an
earlier calculation of all argon lines
[16, 29] needed to interpret spectra
from an ECRIS [15]. Here we have
expanded on this previous work, by
adding all the conﬁgurations that
can be generated from all single and
double excitations up to the n = 3
shell. In one case we performed a

calculation including all correlation
up to the n = 4 shell. From that, we
can deduce that our calculation is
accurate to within 40 meV. The self-
energy screening has been evaluated
by two diﬀerent methods, one based
on the Welton approximation, and
the other one based on the direct
evaluation of the QED diagrams[30].
This show that we can expect an un-
certainty around 40 meV from QED.
The results of the calculation for one
transition in Ar, and a comparison
with the experimental value are pre-
sented on Table 1.

On Fig. 3 we present the diﬀerence of
the preliminary experimental tran-
sition energies and the theoretical
ones, together with statistical ﬁtting

uncertainties. One can see that, even
though diﬀerent crystals have been
used, and 3 diﬀerent elements have
been measured, this diﬀerences are
very close. This show that our re-
sults are already rather reliable and
our analysis essentially correct. The
average diﬀerence of 0.072 eV can
be explained by missing correlation
contribution, due to the limited ba-
sis set used, by the limitation of the
QED corrections. One should also
remember that the Li-like transi-
tions that we are studying start from
auto-ionizing levels. There should
then be an Auger broadening, much
smaller indeed than for the neutral
case, because of the very small num-
ber of allowed decay channels. But

there must be an Auger shift, of
the same order of magnitude. The
1s2s2p 2P3/2 → 1s22s 2S1/2 has a
radiative width of 66 meV and an
Auger width of 6 meV, while for the
1s2s2p 2P1/2 → 1s22s 2S1/2 these val-
ues are 57 meV and 65 meV, respec-
tively [29]. To our knowledge Auger
shifts have been calculated only for
neutral atoms with a K, L or M hole
[1, 2].

transition from He-like ion as a ref-
erence. We get very accurate results,
that compare quite well with theory.
These measurements demonstrate
the potential of the newly-developed
ECRIT at PSI for studies of highly
charged ions. They provide very
interesting testing ground for rela-
tivistic many-body theory and QED,
that cannot be matched by even the
most accurate X-ray measurements
on neutral atoms in solid targets.

It has been proposed that the radio-frequency electric-dipole (E1) transition between two nearly
degenerate opposite-parity states in atomic dysprosium should be highly sensitive to possible tem-
poral variation of the ﬁne structure constant (α) [V. A. Dzuba, V. V. Flambaum, and J. K. Webb,
Phys. Rev. A 59, 230 (1999)]. We discuss here an experimental realization of the proposed search,
which involves monitoring the E1 transition frequency over a period of time using direct frequency
counting techniques. We estimate that a statistical sensitivity of | ˙α/α| ∼ 10−18/yr may be achieved
and discuss possible systematic eﬀects in such a measurement.

INTRODUCTION

Temporal variation of the fundamental constants of
nature would signify new physics beyond the Standard
Model, as discussed in a recent review [1]. Various the-
ories constructed to unify gravity with the other forces
allow or necessitate such a variation [2, 3, 4, 5]. Of re-
cent interest is the astrophysical evidence for a variation
of the ﬁne structure constant α. From an analysis of
quasar absorption spectra [6] over the redshift range .5 <
10−5
z < 3.5, a 4σ deviation of ∆α/α = (
from zero was reported. Assuming a linear shift over
1010 years, this corresponds to a temporal variation
∼
10−16/yr. This value seems
of

It has been suggested [13, 14] that the electric-dipole
(E1) transition between two nearly degenerate opposite-
parity states in atomic dysprosium (Dy; Z=66) should be
highly sensitive to variations in α. Indeed, a recent cal-
culation [15] supports this conclusion. An experimental
search utilizing these states is currently underway and is
discussed here. We provide an analysis of possible sys-
tematic eﬀects and show that this search could ultimately
reach a sensitivity of

10−18/yr.

II. VARIATION OF ALPHA IN DYSPROSIUM

Tests of variation of α in atomic systems rely upon the
fact that relativistic corrections depend diﬀerently on α
for diﬀerent energy levels. The total energy of a level can
be written as

E = E0 + q(α2/α2

1) +

(α3),

0 −

O

(1)

where E0 is the present-day energy, α0 is the present-day
value of the ﬁne structure constant, and q is a coeﬃcient
which determines the sensitivity to variations of α. This
coeﬃcient mainly depends upon the electronic conﬁgura-
tion of the level. A recent calculation [15], utilizing rela-
tivistic Hartree-Fock and conﬁguration interaction meth-
ods, found values of q for two nearly degenerate opposite-
parity states in atomic dysprosium that are both large
and of opposite sign. For the even-parity state (desig-
nated as A), qA/hc = 6008 cm−1 while, for the odd-
23708 cm−1.
parity state (designated as B), qB/hc =

In other words,

The statistical uncertainty of determining the central
γ/√N ,
frequency from a resonance lineshape is δν
where N is the number of counts and γ is the transition
width. In the dysprosium system, γ = 20 kHz is deter-
mined mainly from the lifetime of state A, τA = 7.9 µs
(τB > 200 µs) [16]. A reasonable counting rate of
109 s−1, corresponds to a statistical sensitivity to ν0 of
0.6 τ −1/2 Hz√s where τ is the integration time in sec-
2 mHz,

It should be noted that unlike experiments involving
optical frequencies, the sensitivity to a variation in α is
not proportional to δν/ν. The reason is that if ν is small
enough, the uncertainty in its determination is no longer
limited by the relative uncertainty of the reference clock
frequency (νclock), but rather by other experimental un-
certainties. For example, a modest Cs clock provides an
absolute accuracy of 10−12. In the Dy transitions con-
sidered here, typical frequencies are
1 GHz or smaller.
Thus the clock uncertainty will only become an issue
when other uncertainties can be reduced to the level of

and even then can be overcome in a straightforward way
by using a better reference clock.

III. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE

A. Overview

The experimental search for a variation of the E1 tran-
sition frequency between the two opposite-parity states
will proceed as follows. As shown in Fig. 1, atoms are
populated [17] to the longer-lived odd-parity state B
(τB > 200 µs [16]) via three transitions. The ﬁrst two
transitions require light at 833 nm and 669 nm, respec-

tively. The third transition involves spontaneous decay
with a branching ratio of 30% and the emission of 1397-
nm light. Once in state B, atoms are transferred to state
A with an rf electric ﬁeld, whose frequency is referenced
to a commercial Cs frequency standard. A resonance
lineshape is attained by scanning the rf frequency and
monitoring 564-nm light from the second step of ﬂuores-
cence from state A.

rf transitions

)

Because the energy separation between the nearly de-
generate levels is on the order of hyperﬁne splittings and
isotope shift energies (Fig. 2), and because dysprosium
has seven stable isotopes, there are many choices of rf
frequencies. Table I shows a table of rf frequencies be-
low 2 GHz calculated from measured hyperﬁne constants
and isotope shifts [16]. The smallest transition frequency
(3.1 MHz) occurs for the F = 10.5 components of 163Dy
(the same transition is used in a search for parity noncon-
servation (PNC) [18]). The lowest transition frequency
that oﬀers a high counting rate is the 235 MHz transition
in 162Dy. This is because of a large isotopic abundance
and the fact that there are no hyperﬁne levels to dilute
the atomic population. As discussed below, the choice of
rf transition is also important in regard to sensitivity to
systematic eﬀects.

C. Apparatus

We have studied states A and B extensively as a sys-
tem to measure atomic PNC eﬀects [18]. Although our
current apparatus is optimized for a PNC experiment, it
is suitable for a measurement of ˙α with only minor mod-
iﬁcations. We describe this system here in order to make
a realistic evaluation of a possible experiment.

An atomic beam is produced by an eﬀusive oven op-
erating at 1500 K . The atoms pass through collimators
and approach the interaction region (Fig. 3) where the
desired electric and magnetic ﬁelds are produced.
In-
side the interaction region, the atoms encounter the laser
beams used in the population scheme. The rf electric
ﬁeld is formed between two wire grids, which are used
in order to minimize surface area and thus stray charge
accumulation. Typical electric ﬁeld amplitudes are
5
∼
V/cm. If necessary, a magnetic ﬁeld of up to
4 G can
be applied. It is produced by eight turns of gold-plated

∼

copper wire surrounding the interaction region. The en-
tire interaction region is placed inside a magnetic shield.
As atoms decay from state A, 564-nm light from the sec-
ond step of ﬂuorescence (Fig. 1) is collected by a light
pipe and detected by a photomultiplier tube. The ex-
tent of the light pipe area is shown by the dashed box in
Fig. 3.

Resonance lineshapes (Fig. 4) have recently been at-
tained with this apparatus. Here, a magnetic ﬁeld is
scanned in the presence of a dc electric ﬁeld revealing
Zeeman-level-crossing resonances for 163Dy. For the mea-
surement of
˙α, the signal-to-noise will be much greater
as individual Zeeman resonances will not be resolved.

The interaction region can be improved by making it
shorter, as most atoms decay within twice the lifetime
of state A (τA = 7.9 µs). Given a mean atomic velocity
of 5
8 mm.
Furthermore, a shorter interaction region will allow for
improved light collection eﬃciency, better suppression of

104 cm/s, an appropriate length will be

For an asymmetrical resonance, knowledge of the line-
shape is only necessary if the asymmetry changes over
time, i.e. there will be an apparent shift of the central
frequency between measurements. In the following sec-
tion, we discuss mechanisms leading to possible lineshape
asymmetry and estimate the corresponding shifts.

IV. SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS

High statistical sensitivity implies that our technique
will likely be limited by how well we can control sys-
tematic eﬀects. Below we analyze possible systematics
and give estimates of how well various parameters of the
experiment need to be controlled in order to achieve a
sensitivity of

10−18/yr.

sensitivity to systematics related to stray electric ﬁelds.
In an earlier PNC search, we reported stray dc E-ﬁelds

So long as the resonance is symmetrical, its exact shape
is not important in the determination of the central fre-
quency. The natural lineshape is a Lorentzian with a
width (γ
20 kHz) determined mainly by the lifetime
of state A (τA = 7.9 µs). To a ﬁrst approximation,
both transit-time and Doppler broadening change the
lineshape in a symmetrical fashion. For an interaction

where ν is the applied rf frequency, d is the dipole ma-

so-called Bloch-Siegert term contributes to an actual shift
of the central frequency of the resonance lineshape. For
a saturated transition, we have d2E2/γ2

If the Zeeman sublevels are equally popu-
lated but still unresolved, then this ﬁeld does not shift
the central frequency of a resonance lineshape but rather
only broadens the lineshape with a corresponding width
1 Hz. However, an imbalance
of
of sublevel populations can lead to asymmetric broaden-

D. Millman eﬀect in electric resonance

−

Misalignments of the atomic beam and the geometry
of the electrodes can cause the direction of the rf E-
ﬁeld to rotate, as seen by a moving atom. This may
lead to frequency shifts [21] analogous to the Millman
eﬀect encountered in magnetic resonance [22]. Let Ω be
the frequency of this apparent E-ﬁeld rotation. Because
an oscillating ﬁeld can be decomposed into two counter-
rotating components: one component is shifted by +Ω
and the other by

Ω.

Using the measured homogeneity of our electric ﬁeld,
we estimate Ω <
50 Hz. However, for a resonance line-
∼
shape with unresolved sublevels, the central frequency
remains largely unaﬀected. This is not true in the case
of magnetic resonance (where transitions occur between
magnetically split sublevels of the same level) and can be
explained as follows: In the basis in which the quantiza-
tion axis is perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, there are
only σ+ and σ− transitions. The Millman eﬀect causes
shifts in the frequencies of these transitions as illustrated
in Fig. 5 for a ∆J = 0 transition on resonance (where we
have assumed that the apparent electric ﬁeld rotation is
in the same sense as the σ+ component). If the sublevels
of the initial state are equally populated and Ω
γ, then
these shifts only lead to a broadening of the lineshape.
However, if there is an imbalance of sublevel populations
the broadening is asymmetric, which can cause an ap-
ξΩ,
parent shift in the central frequency by an amount
where ξ is the degree of atomic orientation. As men-
tioned earlier, residual circular polarization in the lin-
early polarized light, used in the ﬁrst and second step of

∼
achieved with standard UHV equipment. The pressure
stability and composition of the residual gas will be moni-
tored with a residual gas analyzer. However, we may ﬁnd
that collisional shifts are much smaller because the A-B
transition is nominally between f and d inner-shell elec-
trons [24]. In addition, quenching cross-sections, which
eﬀectively remove atoms from the beam, are expected to
be large and so will reduce the eﬀect of collisional shifts.
Another concern is collisional shifts due to Dy atoms
themselves. In the absence of collisional quenching, the
worst-case estimate is that the present Dy density (
∼
1010 atoms/cm3) gives a shift of
2 Hz. This eﬀect will
be investigated and, if needed, the Dy beam intensity can
be monitored and stabilized.

∼

G. Doppler Shift

The eﬀect of the ﬁrst-order Doppler shift is estimated
to be small. To see this, we model the electric ﬁeld
(Fig. 3) as a standing wave constructed from two travel-
ing waves propagating along the direction of the atomic
beam. Due to ohmic losses within each electric-ﬁeld
plate, the amplitude of each wave gets attenuated. A
diﬀerence in the power in these waves leads to asym-
metric Doppler broadening of the lineshape, and thus an
apparent shift. We estimate this diﬀerence by ﬁrst con-
sidering the B-ﬁeld induced by the time-varying E-ﬁeld.
This B-ﬁeld persists inside the plates to within a skin-
depth, inducing currents from which the power loss into
the plates can be readily calculated [25]. We estimate
the fractional power diﬀerence and, thus, the asymmetry
to be <
10−4 for a transition frequency of 1 GHz. Since

symmetric fashion. Thus, this shift is only required to
be stable to

E. Black-body radiation

Black-body radiation (BBR) can cause ac Stark
shifts [23]. The rms value of the black-body radiation

A shift in the transition frequency arises from the diﬀer-
ence in the ac Stark shifts experienced by levels A and B.
We can give a rough estimate of this Stark shift (δνBB)
for one of these levels using Eq. (6):

where ∆ is a characteristic atomic energy scale, νBB is a
characteristic frequency of room-temperature BBR, and
d = 1 ea0 is a typical optical transition dipole moment.
Due to cancellations of contributions from nearby energy
levels above and below the A and B levels, we assume that
the net shift comes mainly from levels with large energy

simultaneously measure the transition frequency between
hyperﬁne levels of a given parity state. The reason is
that, because the levels involved have the same relativis-
tic corrections, this frequency is insensitive to variations
of α. One possible scheme is to excite an M1 transition,
e. g., as shown in Fig. 6, whose frequency can be mon-
itored by looking for disappearance in the ﬂuorescence
from level A for a ﬁxed E1 transition frequency. Alter-
natively, we can utilize another E1 transition as shown
in Fig. 7. In this scenario, α variation is twice as large
in the sum of the two frequencies, while the diﬀerence is
insensitive to α variations.

Furthermore, one can compare E1 transitions for the
two abundant isotopes with zero nuclear spin (162Dy and
164Dy). The counting rate is signiﬁcantly higher and the
level structure is much simpler without hyperﬁne inter-
actions.

V. DISCUSSION

In summary, rf E1 transitions in Dy provide an at-
tractive system in which to test the temporal variation
of α. The frequencies of these transitions can be di-
rectly counted. For a limit of ˙α/α < 10−15/yr, the shift
was calculated to be
2 Hz/yr. At present, a statis-
tical sensitivity of 0.6 Hz in one second of integration
time is achievable. Knowledge of systematic eﬀects are
critical to this experiment. Preliminary analysis shows
that they can be controlled to a level corresponding to
10−18/yr, a level of sensitivity that would rival
˙α/α

that of the most stringent observational limit set by the
Oklo natural reactor.

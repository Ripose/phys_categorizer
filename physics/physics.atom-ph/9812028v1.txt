Abstract

The van der Waals coeﬃcients for the alkali-metal atoms from Na to Fr
interacting in their ground states, are calculated using relativistic ab initio
methods. The accuracy of the calculations is estimated by also evaluating
atomic static electric dipole polarizabilities and coeﬃcients for the interaction
of the atoms with a perfectly conducting wall. The results are in excellent
agreement with the latest data from ultra-cold collisions and from studies of
magnetic ﬁeld induced Feshbach resonances in Na and Rb. For Cs we provide
critically needed data for ultra-cold collision studies.

The van der Waals interaction plays an important role in characterizing ultra-cold col-
lisions between two ground state alkali-metal atoms. While the calculation of interaction
coeﬃcients has been a subject of great interest in atomic, molecular and chemical physics for
a very long time, it is only very recently that novel cold collision experiments, photoassocia-
tion spectroscopy, and analyses of magnetic ﬁeld induced Feshbach resonances have yielded
strict constraints on magnitudes of the coeﬃcients. Moreover, due to the extreme sensitivity
of elastic collisions to the long-range part of the potentials, knowledge of the van der Waals
coeﬃcients inﬂuences predictions of signs and magnitudes of scattering lengths. Although
many theoretical methods have been developed over the years to calculate van der Waals
coeﬃcients, persistent discrepancies remain.

In this paper, various relativistic ab initio methods are applied to determine the van der
Waals coeﬃcients for the alkali-metal dimers of Na to Fr [1]. As a check on our calculations,
we also evaluate the atom-wall interaction constants, which have recently been calculated
by other methods, and use them as a sensitive test of the quality of our wave functions.
Furthermore, we calculate atomic polarizabilities and compare them to experimental data,
where available.

Using the latter relation, we have previously [2] determined the values of C3 coeﬃcients for
alkali-metal atoms using many-body methods.

The dipole operator R, being a one-particle operator, can have non-vanishing matrix
elements for intermediate states represented by two types of Slater determinant. Firstly,
the valence electron v can be promoted to some other valence state w. Secondly, one of the
core orbitals a can be excited to a virtual state m, leaving the valence state v unchanged.
In the language of second-quantization, the ﬁrst type of states is represented by a†
w|0ci and
the second type by a†
v|0ci, where |0ci describes the core. These states will be referred
to as “valence” and “autoionizing” states, respectively.

In accordance with such a classiﬁcation, we break the total polarizability α into three
parts: the polarizability due to valence states αv, the core polarizability αc, and the valence-
core coupling term αcv, with

α = αv + αc + αcv.

The last two terms arise from the summation over autoionizing states. In evaluating the
core polarizability we permit excitations into all possible states outside the core. The term
αcv is a counter term accounting for the consequent violation of the Pauli principle.

Various states contribute at drastically diﬀerent levels to the dynamic polarizability.
For example, 96% of the static polarizability of Cs is determined by the two intermediate
valence states 6P1/2 and 6P3/2, other valence states contribute less than 1%. The core
polarizability accounts for approximately 4% of the total value and the contribution of the
core-valence coupling term is about −0.1%. The relative sizes of contributions to the static
polarizabilities for the other alkali-metal atoms are similar. The dynamic polarizability
α(iω), given in Eq. (1), behaves as

α(iω) ∼

fvk/ω2 = N/ω2 ,

Xk

at large value of ω, where we have used the nonrelativistic oscillator strength sum rule
S (0) =
fvk = N. Because the ratio αc/αv nonrelativistically is close to N − 1 we
expect the core polarizability to give the major contribution at large ω. Therefore, the core
polarizability becomes increasingly important for heavier atoms.

P

Based on the above argument, we use several many-body techniques of varying accuracy
to calculate the diﬀerent contributions to the total polarizability. In particular, we employed
the relativistic single-double (SD) all-order method to obtain the leading contribution from
valence states [3]. The core polarizability is obtained from the relativistic random-phase
approximation (RRPA) [4]. The core-valence coupling term and the non-leading contribu-
tion from valence states is estimated in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock approximation by a direct
summation over basis set functions [5].

The relativistic single-double (SD) all-order method has been previously used to obtain
high-precision atomic properties for the ﬁrst few excited states in alkali-atom systems [3].
The results of theoretical SD matrix elements and comparison with experimental data are
presented elsewhere [6]. Generally, the electric-dipole matrix elements for principal transi-
tions agree with precise experimental data to better than 0.5% for all alkali-metal atoms;
the calculations being more accurate for lighter elements. In the present work, for Na, K,
Rb, and Cs, we have used SD matrix elements for the ﬁrst six lowest P1/2 and P3/2 levels.
For Fr, we have used SD matrix elements for a principal transition and matrix elements cal-
culated with the third-order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), described in [7], for
four other lowest P1/2 and P3/2 states. Unless noted otherwise, we have used experimental
values of energy levels from Ref. [8] and from the compilation of Dzuba et al. [9] for Fr.

The relativistic random-phase approximation (RRPA) was used previously to obtain
static core polarizabilities for all alkali-metal atoms except Fr in Ref. [4]. In the present
calculations we reformulated the original diﬀerential equation method used in [4] in terms
of basis sets [5], in a manner similar to [10]. We reproduce the results of Ref. [4] and, in
addition, obtain a value of 20.41 a.u. for the static dipole polarizability of the Fr+ ion. Zhou

3

and Norcross [11] ﬁnd αc(0) = 15.644(5) for the polarizability of Cs+, by ﬁtting Rydberg
states energies to a model potential for Cs, while the present RRPA calculations yield the
value αc(0)=15.81. Based on this comparison, we expect the RRPA method to give at least
a few per cent accuracy in the calculation of αc(iw).

To demonstrate the sensitivity of our results to errors in the core polarizability, we present
the ratios of values calculated omitting αc to the total values of α(0), C3, and C6 in Table I.
We see that while α(0) is aﬀected at the level of a few per cent, the core contribution to
C6 becomes increasingly important for heavier systems. αc(iw) contributes 2% to C6 for
Na and 23% for Fr. The atom-wall interaction constant C3, obtained with Eq. (3), is the
most sensitive to the core contribution. Indeed, while αc contributes 16% of C3 for Na, it
accounts for the half of the total value of C3 for Fr.

The tabulation of our results for static dipole polarizabilities, atom-wall interaction con-
stants C3, and C6 dispersion coeﬃcients is presented in Tables II–IV. In Method I we use
high-precision experimental values [12] for dipole matrix elements of the principal transi-
tion. We used a weighted average of experimental data if there were several measurements
for a particular transition. In Method II we use the theoretical SD matrix elements for the
principal transition. We recommend using the values obtained with Method I for α(0) and
C6, since the accuracy of experimental data for the principal transitions is better than that
of SD predictions.

In Table II we compare our calculations with experimental data for static polarizabilities.
We ﬁnd perfect agreement with a high-precision value for Na obtained in recent atom-
interferometry experiments [13]. The experimental data for static polarizabilities of K, Rb,
and Cs are known with the accuracy of about 2% [14,15]. While we agree with those
experimental values, we believe that our theoretical approach gives more accurate results,
mainly due to the overwhelming contribution of the principal transition to the sum over
intermediate states. The electric-dipole matrix elements for principal transitions are known
typically at the level 0.1% accuracy for all alkalis. The theoretical error is estimated from
the experimental accuracy of matrix elements [12], from an estimated 5% error for the core
polarizabilities, and 10% error for the remaining contributions to α(0).

A sensitive test of the quality of the present dynamic polarizability functions is obtained
by calculating C3 coeﬃcients in two diﬀerent ways: i ) by direct integration of α(iω) using
Eq. (3) and ii ) by calculating the diagonal expectation value of R2 in Eq. (4).
In the
present work we extend calculations of the expectation value of R2 [2] in the SD formalism
to obtain C3 values for Rb, Cs, and Fr. In the Table III, we compare the SD values for
C3 with those obtained in [2] using MBPT. The diﬀerence of 7% for Cs and 10% for Fr
between SD and MBPT values is not surprising, since the MBPT [7] underestimates the
line-strength of principal transitions by a few per cent for Cs and Fr. To make a consistent
comparison between the C3 values obtained by integrating α(iω) and by calculating the
expectation value, we have used SD energies and matrix elements in Method II calculations
in Table III. These C3 values agree to about 0.6% for Na, 1% for K and Rb, 2.5% for Cs,
and 3.4% for Fr. At present, it appears no experimental data are available for comparison.
We assume that most of the error is due to the RRPA method used to calculate the core
polarizability. Therefore, the error estimates in C6 are based on the accuracy of experimental
matrix elements for the principal transition [12], and by scaling the error of core contribution
from C3 to C6, using Table I.

The comparison of C6 coeﬃcients with other calculations is presented in the Table IV.
For Na the results are in good agreement with a semi-empirical determination [16]. The inte-
gration over α(iω) as in Eq. (2) has been most recently used by Marinescu, Sadeghpour, and
Dalgarno [17] and by Patil and Tang [18]. In contrast to the present ab initio calculations,
both works employed model potentials. In addition, Ref. [17] used corrections to multipole
operators to account for core polarization eﬀects with parameters chosen to reproduce the
experimental values of static polarizabilities, which for K, Rb, and Cs atoms are known from
experimental measurements with an accuracy of approximately 2%. The major contribution
in the integration of Eq. (2) arises from the region of ω = 0 and the integrand is quadratic
in α(iω). Therefore, until more accurate experimental values for static polarizabilities are
available, the predictions [17] of C6 for K, Rb, and Cs have an inherent (experimental) ac-
curacy of about 4%. Theoretical uncertainty of the method used in Ref. [17] is determined,
among other factors, by the omitted contribution from core polarizability as discussed in
Refs. [17,19]. Patil and Tang [18] used model-potential calculations with analytical repre-
sentations of wave functions and with experimental energies. They used a direct summation
method in Eq. (1). The contribution from the core polarizability was not included as can
be seen from Eq. (3.4) of Ref. [18]. In fact, this formula in the limit of large ω results in
α(iω) → 1/ω2 instead of the correct limit α(iω) → N/ω2, which follows from the oscillator
strength sum rule. Therefore, the model-potential calculations generally underestimate the
C6 coeﬃcients. Indeed, from the comparison in Table IV, one can see that the C6 values
from Ref. [17] and Ref. [18] are systematically lower than our values.

Maeder and Kutzellnigg [20] used a method alternative to the integral Eq. (2) to calcu-
late dispersion coeﬃcients by minimizing a Hylleraas functional providing a lower bound.
However, their prediction depended on the quality of the solution of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for the ground state. For alkali-metal atoms, model potentials were used to account for
correlations. The predicted static polarizabilities are several per cent higher than experi-
mental values, and are not within the experimental error limits. However, for C6 coeﬃcients
we generally ﬁnd good agreement with the values of Maeder and Kutzellnigg [20].

Recently Marinescu et al. [21] presented calculations of dispersion coeﬃcients of diﬀerent
molecular symmetries for Fr, using a model potential method similar to Ref. [17]. As shown
in Table IV our result for Fr is signiﬁcantly larger than the result of Ref. [21]. We believe
this may be because the method of Ref. [21] does not completely take into account the
contribution of the core polarizability, which accounts for 23% of C6 for Fr.

Elastic scattering experiments and photoassociation spectroscopy have sensitively con-
strained the possible values of C6 for Na and Rb. Van Abeelen and VerHaar [22] re-
viewed spectroscopic and cold-collision data for Na, including data from recent observa-
tions of magnetic ﬁeld induced Feshbach resonances [23]. They considered values for Na of
1539 < C6 < 1583 and concluded that C6 = 1539 gave the best consistency between data
sets. Our result for Na using Method I is in particularly good agreement with this value.
Photoassociation experiments [24] for Rb limits the C6 coeﬃcient to a range 4400-4900 a.u.
and even more recently [25] a study of a Feshbach resonance in elastic collisions of 85Rb
concluded C6 = 4700(50). Our value C6 = 4691(23) is in excellent agreement with this
experiment. For Cs, knowledge of the value of C6 is critical for predictions of the sign of the
elastic scattering length [26], though it has been demonstrated the resulting cross sections
are not particularly sensitive to the value of C6 [27]. For Fr, the paucity of other dimer data

constrains quantitative theoretical collisional studies for the near future. As photoassocia-
tion experiments move beyond the alkali-metal atoms to other atoms with many electrons
such as Sr [28] and Cr [29], it will be important to have reliable ab initio methods for cal-
culation of atomic properties. The approaches presented here could, in principle, be applied
to Sr and perhaps with some signiﬁcant eﬀort to Cr.

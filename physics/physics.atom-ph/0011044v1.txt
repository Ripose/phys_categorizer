Abstract

Higher order (α/π)2 (Z α)6 logarithmic corrections to the hydrogen Lamb
shift are calculated. The results obtained show the two-loop contribution has
a very peculiar behavior, and signiﬁcantly alter the theoretical predictions for
low lying S-states.

The calculation of the two-loop contribution to the Lamb shift in hydrogen is one of
the most challenging projects in bound state QED [1,2]. Since direct numerical calculations
with the use of Dirac-Coulomb propagators have not yet been completed, one has to rely on
the Z α expansion:

∆E = m

B40 + (Z α) B50

(cid:21)

The leading order correction B40 can be obtained from the slope of the electron form-factor
F1 and F2 at q2 = 0. It is known analytically and its numerical value is quite small (for
S-states includic vacuum polarization)

The calculation of the next order correction B50 was completed only a few years ago inde-
pendently by two groups in [3] and [4]. The value was surprisingly large

B40 = 0.538941 .

B50 =

21.5561(31) .

Moreover, this correction led to strong disagreement in He+ Lamb shift with the most
precise experimental value in [5], while for hydrogen Lamb shift, led to agreement with
the Mainz value for the proton charge radius [6]. This large value of B50 compared to B40
indicates a very slow convergence or even might suggest an nonperturbative behavior of
the two-loop contribution.
Indeed, the direct numerical calculations of one diagram, the
loop-by-loop electron self–energy by Mallampali and Sapirstein in [7], shows that the value
of this correction at Z = 1 is of diﬀerent sign and magnitude, that the one based on ﬁrst
two terms of analytic expansion. Moreover, this numerical calculation was in disagreement
with the analytical value of B63 in [8], while it was argued in [8], that this correction
comes only from this one diagram in the covariant gauge. A year later another group [9]
calculated numerically this one diagram and found agreement with the analytic expansion
including ln3(Z α)−2 term. While this may suggest that the ﬁrst numerical calculations
were incorrect, a very recent, third numerical result by Yerokhin in [10] conﬁrmed the ﬁrst
one [7]. So, this situation with the two-loop contribution is very unclear. Moreover, the
analytic value ln3(Z α)−2 term corresponding to all diagrams, was conﬁrmed independently
by several groups, so this situation is even more confusing.
It was argued, by Yerokhin
in [10], that the ln3(Z α)−2 term for this one loop-by-loop diagram is diﬀerent from the
total value of B63, and in fact found an additional contribution. However, the value for
this term, coming from all diagrams might be correct, because other diagrams may contain
compensating terms. The goal of this work is to shed some light into higher order two-loop
corrections and calculate all logarithmic terms: B63, B62, and B61. We ﬁnd that indeed the
two-loop contribution has a very peculiar behavior, as the higher order term B61 dominates
and reverses the sign for the overall logarithmic contribution. In next sections we present
some details of this calculation. First, a simple example is worked out to demonstrate the
method, then we pass to the most diﬃcult two-photon-loop diagrams and complete with
remaining diagrams containing an electron loop. Conclusions with prospects of calculation
of B60 summarize this work.

around large ω for ground state of the hydrogen atom. More precisely, we concentrate on
the ω−3 term. For simplicity, we put here m = 1, α = 1. From one side P (ω) is known
analytically [11]

so one could get this coeﬃcient from here. However, our ﬁnal goal is to calculate the two-
loop contribution, for which no analytic formula has been derived so far. Therefore, we use
a diﬀerent approach, based on the eﬀective Hamiltonian. First, we regularize the Coulomb
interaction by the following replacement:

V (r) =

With the regularized potential (P

There is an implicit subtraction at p′ = 0 for removal of small p′ divergence. It corresponds
to subtraction of lower order contributions. Additionally, only the ω−3 term is selected. The
sum

is independent of λ in the limit of large λ and agrees with that from the expansion of analytic
formula in Eq. (5). The advantage of this method is the direct application to the two-loop
Lamb shift.

II. TWO-LOOP LAMB SHIFT

The calculations of two-loop Lamb shift in the order of α2(Z α)6 is more complicated due
to the presence of powers of ln(Z α). It reﬂects the fact that several energy and momentum
regions contribute. For these calculations we introduce a number of cutoﬀ parameters to

2. Additionally
λ ’splits’ the integration over electron momenta. The splitting itself, does not help too
much. The key trick is the assumption that after expansion in Z α one goes to the limits
0, ǫ1 →
ǫ2 →
, in the order as written. The two-loop contribution
is split accordingly

and calculated separately, each term in the most convenient gauge. In the following sec-
tions we calculate all logs. The constant term B60 is left unevaluated, however we lay the
groundwork for its calculation.

III. CONTRIBUTION EL

Diagrams in the Coulomb gauge in NRQED are presented on Fig. 2. We calculate them
ﬁrst, for photon energies inside a rectangular box 0 < ω1 < ǫ1, 0 < ω2 < ǫ2, ǫ2 << ǫ1,
and after combine to the region EL as shown in Fig. 1. The expression derived from
nonrelativistic QED for all these diagrams is:

It is a two-loop analog of Bethe logs. We have not found a way to calculate its matrix
elements analytically in a compact form, therefore we proceed in a diﬀerent way. One ﬁnds,

First of all the result for B61 is surprisingly large, and reverses the sign of the overall
logarithmic contribution. B63 agrees with the result obtained ﬁrst in [8]. However, as it was
pointed out by Yerokhin [10], the loop-by-loop diagram is the source of additional terms,
which were not accounted for in the calculation in [8]. An additional result of this work
is the state dependence of B coeﬃcients which is obtained from n-dependence of matrix
elements in Eqs. (20,26,27)

n-dependence of B62 agrees with the former result in [14] (apart from the misprint in the
overall sign there). B61 depends on N-coeﬃcient, the Dirac delta correction to Bethe logs,

9

which has not been calculated yet for other states than 1S, therefore its complete state de-
pendence is unknown. However, one may expect to a good approximation N is independent
of n, as it is for Bethe logs.

Because of the large value of B61 theoretical predictions for hydrogen Lamb shift are going
to be changed. The total logarithmic contribution is 16.9 kHz for the 1S state, compared
to the previous one, based only on B63 -28.4 kHz. Theoretical predictions for Lamb shift in
hydrogen with proton radius rp = 0.862(12) fm from [15], using recent updates: analytical
calculations of the three-loop contribution by Melnikov and Ritbergen in [16] and direct
numerical calculation of one-loop self-energy by Jentschura et al. in [17] are (see details in
the appendix)

EL(1S)th = 8 172 816(10)(32) kHz,
2P1/2)th = 1 057 842(1)(4) kHz,

EL(2S

−
100, which gives the ﬁrst uncertainty. For P -states we neglect
where we assumed for B60 = 0
B-terms completely. The second uncertainty comes from the proton charge radius. Since
it dominates the theoretical error, we emphasize the importance of the muonic-hydrogen
measurement, from which rp could be precisely obtained. Current theoretical predictions
agrees well with the most precise experimental values:

±

EL(1S)exp = 8 172 837(22) kHz [18, 19],

−
−

2P1/2)exp = 1 057 845(9) kHz [20],
2P1/2)exp = 1 057 842(12) kHz [21].

Due to large uncertainty and ambiguities with the proton charge radius, one may regard the
Lamb measurement as a determination of rp. In this way, from 1S Lamb shift, one obtains:

rp = 0.869(12) fm .

Logarithmic two-loop corrections signiﬁcantly alter theoretical predictions for the Lamb shift
in the single ionized helium as well. The current theoretical value is

EL(2S

2P1/2)th = 14 041.57(8) MHz .

−

It does not agree with both: the experimental value from [22] and the recent update in [23]
respectively:

EL(2S
EL(2S

−
−

2P1/2)exp = 14 042.52(16) MHz ,
2P1/2)exp = 14 041.13(17) MHz .

One may wonder about B60 and further higher order terms, keeping in mind the large value
of B61. There are two possible and complementary undergoing projects: direct calculation
of this term or numerical calculation of complete two-loop diagrams with Dirac-Coulomb
propagators. While the second would be the best way, the numerical accuracy might be
limited at small Z, such as Z = 1. In the direct calculation of B60 one has to consider three
points: two-loop Bethe logs with ǫ cut-oﬀs, two-loop scattering amplitude with the photon
mass µ, and the transition terms between ǫ and µ. This project seems to be achievable using
the methods developed for B50, positronium decay rate and the one applied here.

APPENDIX A: FORMULAS FOR CALCULATIONS OF LAMB SHIFT

In the calculation of hydrogen and helium Lamb shift we use the following physical constants:

R = 10973731.568516(84) m−1 ,
c = 299792458 m s−1 ,
α−1 = 137.03599958(50) ,
mp

me

= 1836.1526675(39) ,

= 7294.299508(16) ,

rp = 0.862(12) fm ,
rα = 1.673(1) fm .

In general, Lamb shift in light hydrogen like systems is a sum of nonrecoil, recoil and the
proton structure contributions. In the nonrecoil limit, known terms are:

where µ is a reduced mass, m = me, and L = ln[m/(µ (Z α)2)]. Most of these coeﬃcients
could be ﬁnd in any review, such as [1] or [2]. The recent result is the direct numerical
calculations of one-loop self-energy, what give for hydrogen (Z = 1)

and for He+ (Z = 2)

where the second term is the vacuum polarization [24]. Another recent result is analytical
calculation of three-loop contribution in [16]. Together with the previously known vacuum
polarization and anomalous magnetic moment it amounts

C40 = 0.417508 .

(A5)

In this work we calculate all logarithmic two-loop corrections for S-states. However, for
P-state only B62 is known. For this reason in the theoretical predictions for hydrogen and
helium we totally neglect higher order two loop corrections, but B40 for P states. We neglect
also dependence of N in Eq. (20) on principal quantum number n, since N has not yet been
calculated for n
= 1. Recoil corrections, not included in Eq. (A2) sum to

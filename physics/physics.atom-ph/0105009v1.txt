We demonstrate a novel optical dipole trap which is based on the enhancement of the optical power
density of a Nd:YAG laser beam in a resonator. The trap is particularly suited for experiments with
ultracold gases, as it combines a potential depth of order 1 mK with storage times of several tens of
seconds. We study the interactions in a gas of fermionic lithium atoms in our trap and observe the
inﬂuence of spin-changing collisions and oﬀ-resonant photon scattering. A key element in reaching
long storage times is an ultra-low noise laser. The dependence of the storage time on laser noise is
investigated.

Far-detuned optical dipole traps are rapidly becoming
standard tools for atomic physics at ultralow tempera-
tures [1]. They allow trapping of practically any atomic
species, and even molecules. In the ﬁeld of quantum gases
they allow trapping of mixed-state and mixed-species en-
sembles. The coupling of the atoms to the light ﬁeld,
which is small for far detuned traps, can be strongly
enhanced by means of an optical resonator.
Indeed,
in cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments, single
atoms have been trapped by a light ﬁeld that corre-
sponds to a single photon [2]. Optical resonators have
also been used to sensitively detect optical ﬁelds in a
quantum non-demolition way using cold atoms [3], and
even open up new possibilities for optical cooling of atoms
and molecules [4].

the trap volume and potential depth are large to transfer
many atoms into the trap. We expect the high opti-
cal power density reached in the REDT will be useful
in many contexts, for instance for trapping earth-alkali
atoms, buﬀer-gas cooled atoms or cold molecules.

Our primary interest is in spin mixtures of fermionic
6Li, as a promising candidate system for the formation of
Cooper pairs in an atomic gas [5]. In particular, we aim
to study Feshbach scattering resonances which have been
predicted at experimentally accessible magnetic ﬁelds,
which may provide a binding mechanism for the Cooper
pairs [6].

To suﬃciently suppress photon scattering, the trap
light must be detuned from the 670-nm D lines of Li
by few hundred nm. In addition, to capture atoms from
a magneto-optical trap (MOT), the optical trap must
have a depth of the order of the temperature of Li in a
MOT (∼ 1 mK), and a similar spatial extension. The
optical power required to create such a trap without res-
onant enhancement exceeds 100 W. Our REDT only re-
quires a 1.2 W Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064nm), the power
density of which is resonantly enhanced 130-fold in a
15 cm near-confocal resonator (See Fig. 1). The res-
onator mirrors are placed outside the vacuum, which fa-
cilitates adjustment of the resonator and at the same
time avoids many of the problems associated with op-
tics in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). The MOT overlaps
with approximately 1000 antinodes of the standing wave,
which act as separate microtraps, with an axial separa-
tion of λ/2 = 532nm and a radial extension given by the
beam waist, w0 = 160µm. The resonator length is in-
creased by ∼ 3 mm from the confocal condition to lift
the degeneracy of the higher order modes. The optical
losses at the vacuum windows are minimized by using a
high purity fused-silica UHV cell and by traversing all
intracavity glass surfaces at Brewster’s angle. The small
residual round trip loss L permits a maximal resonant
enhancement A = 1/L, where the resonant enhancement
factor A is deﬁned as the increase of the intracavity in-
tensity compared to a retroﬂected beam standing wave

FIG. 1. Setup of the resonator trap. The atoms are trapped

in ∼ 1000 antinodes of the standing wave.

In this letter we demonstrate a resonator-enhanced
dipole trap (REDT) for experiments with ultracold gases.
We take advantage of the resonant enhancement of the
optical power density and the corresponding trap depth.
To suppress photon scattering and reach storage times
of several tens of seconds, the detuning of the trap light
from the atomic resonances is large. At the same time

to the number of atoms in an optically thin MOT, with
an uncertainty of 50% in the calibration.

The number of atoms transferred into the REDT can
be estimated for a shallow trap (trap depth smaller than
MOT temperature) as the phase-space density provided
by the MOT multiplied by the number of quantum states
in the shallow trap. The latter increases with the trap
depth to the power 3/2. We observe this behavior ex-
perimentally up to the maximum available power, even
though the condition of a shallow trap is not strictly ful-
ﬁlled.

The storage time of atoms in an optical trap is usually
limited by rest-gas collisions, interatomic processes, oﬀ-
resonant photon scattering or heating due to laser noise.
In our apparatus, at a pressure of 3 × 10−11 mbar, the
decay rate due to rest-gas collisions has been measured
using magnetically trapped Li atoms, it is 8 × 10−3 s−1,
which poses an upper limit to the storage time of 125 s.
Interatomic collisions in 6Li strongly depend on the
composition of the trapped gas. By choosing the order
in which we turn oﬀ the MOT light ﬁelds we can inﬂu-
ence this composition: turning oﬀ the repumper several
milliseconds before the cooler we obtain atoms in the
F = 1/2 state, by leaving the repumper on longer we ob-
tain atoms in the F = 3/2 state. Atoms in the F = 3/2
state are lost from the trap due to spin changing colli-
sions with a second order decay rate ˙N /N 2 = 2 × 10−5
s−1 (see curve in Fig. 2). Since the initial density of the
trapped atoms is of order 109 cm−3 this implies a rate
constant of order 10−9 cm3/s in agreement with theoret-
ical predictions [6].

trap. To obtain the maximum enhancement, the reﬂec-
tivity R of the input coupler must match L. For our UHV
cell we measured L = ′.′′△(∈) in a test resonator, and
correspondingly we chose R = 0.9940(2). This theoreti-
cally would allow a resonant enhancement factor of 240,
at a calculated ﬁnesse F = 600. We typically measure
A = 130 ± 15, at F = 650 ± 60, where the loss is due to
incomplete mode matching.

A rigid resonator body, which is acoustically decou-
pled from mechanical vacuum pumps by ﬂexible bellows,
provides passive stability. In addition a piezomechanical
actuator compensates for changes in the cavity length
caused e.g. by thermal drifts and acoustical noise. This
servo loop, with a servo bandwidth of 8 kHz, uses the
H¨ansch-Couillaud method to derive an error signal [7],
where the Brewster windows act as the intracavity po-
larizer. No high-bandwidth stabilization proved to be
necessary. The drive laser for the resonator trap is a com-
mercially available ultra-low-noise 1.2 W diode pumped
solid state Nd:YAG laser (Innolight “Mephisto”). Two
Faraday rotators provide a 70 dB reduction of feedback
of the resonator to the laser, and an acousto-optical mod-
ulator provides control over the laser power admitted to
the cavity. Approximately 20% of the laser power is lost
in these elements.

The energy density inside the cavity is the same as in
a retroﬂected 130 W beam, which leads to a calculated
∗. The corresponding photon
trap depth of 0.8 mK ×kB
scattering rate in the intensity maximum is calculated to
be ∼ 1 s−1. In the harmonic approximation of the poten-
tial near the trap center we calculate the axial and radial
trap frequencies ωax/2π = 1.4 MHz and ωrad/2π = 2.0
kHz, respectively. The trap, however, is very anharmonic
and atoms in higher vibrational states oscillate at lower
frequencies.

Our source of cold atoms is a MOT based on diode
lasers [8], which consists of a “cooler” beam, detuned −20
MHz from the 22S1/2 F = 3/2 → 22P3/2 F = 5/2 transi-
tion and a “repumper” at ∼ −20 MHz from 22S1/2 F =
1/2 → 22P3/2 F = 3/2. In the MOT we collect approxi-
mately 2×107 atoms in 10 seconds from a Zeeman slowed
beam. The atoms then are cooled and compressed by re-
ducing the detunings, to a density ∼ 1011 cm−3 at a
temperature <∼ 1 mK. The MOT light beams and mag-
netic ﬁelds are turned oﬀ after 20 ms of compression. The
REDT is kept permanently on during the MOT phase as
it does not inﬂuence the loading of the MOT. Approxi-
mately 0.5% of the atoms remain in the REDT after the
MOT is turned oﬀ, the remainder being lost in the ﬁrst
60 ms. Atoms remaining in the REDT are detected by
turning on the MOT ﬁelds again and subsequently mea-

tain long storage times. An estimate of the relevant loss
rate can be found from a harmonic oscillator model [11]:
Γ = π2ν2Sk(2ν), where ν is the relevant oscillation fre-
quency and Sk is the one-sided power spectrum of relative
intensity noise (RIN) as deﬁned in [11].

In preliminary experiments with a diﬀerent single-
frequency diode pumped Nd:YAG laser, with a RIN of
Sk(2ωax) = 10−9Hz
, we were able to trap atoms, but
storage times were less than one second. The “Mephisto”
laser, which has Sk(2ωax) ≤ 10−14Hz
, is much more
suitable as drive laser and enables the long storage time
shown in Fig. 2. To study the strong dependence of the
storage time on laser noise we modulated the laser output
power with white noise (bandwidth 5 MHz). The result-
ing intracavity RIN was measured on an InGaAs photo-
diode behind the resonator end mirror. Figure 3 shows
that the storage time is inversely proportional to the in-
tensity noise level, τ −1 = (5.1×1010s−1)×Sk(2ωax)×Hz.
The loss rate due to laser noise becomes of the same or-
der as the rest-gas and photon scattering terms at a RIN
−1
level of Sk = 0.5 × 10−12Hz

.
The harmonic oscillator model of Ref. [11] predicts a
loss rate which is approximately two orders of magni-
tude larger than our measured data. However, this sim-
ple model does not take into account the strong anhar-
monicity and anisotropy of optical traps, which cause
many atoms to vibrate at much lower frequencies.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a resonator-
enhanced dipole trap that traps approximately 105
fermionic lithium atoms. Although this type of trap is
sensitive to laser noise, a storage time of several tens of
seconds can be reached by using an ultra-low noise laser.
On this time scale atoms are lost due to photon scattering
and rest-gas collisions.

The storage time in our present system greatly ex-
ceeds the expected collision times in the Li gas at ﬁelds
∼ 0.08T, which are of order one second [6]. Since the
thermal energy of the trapped gas is comparable to the
trap depth, these collisions will then lead to evaporative
cooling of the gas, which can be observed through loss
of atoms. Additionally, by lowering the trap potential in
a controlled way we can measure the energy distribution
of atoms in the trap. Thermalization and loss measure-
ments taken together will characterize the interactions in
the vicinity of the Feshbach resonance.

FIG. 3. Inﬂuence of laser intensity noise on the storage
time. The dashed horizontal line indicates the storage time
with active stabilization of the laser output power. The inten-
sity noise is measured on the photodiode behind the resonator.
Solid line: linear ﬁt through the data. Inset: Noise spectrum

laser noise level.

The atoms in the F = 1/2 hyperﬁne ground state are
non-interacting to a very good approximation, since the
s-wave scattering length between the two Zeeman sub-
levels is very small in low magnetic ﬁeld [6,9], and p-
wave scattering is expected to be strongly suppressed at
the relevant energies. The data show an initial fast decay
on the order of 10 s, followed by a long storage time, the
latter being well described by an exponential decay with
a time constant of ∼ 50 s. The initial decay can be ex-
plained as follows: Since the density of trapped states in
our potential is strongly peaked just below the trap edge,
a large fraction of atoms occupy states which are only
very weakly bound. A single photon recoil momentum
then suﬃces to transfer such an atom into an untrapped
state, therefore the number of weakly bound atoms de-
cays strongly in the ﬁrst few photon scattering times. We
numerically modeled the eﬀect of photon scattering and
rest-gas collisions on the distribution of the atoms, start-
ing from a distribution that matches the density of states
in the trap. Details of this model will be published else-
where. The model curve (Dashed line in Fig. 2), which
has no adjustable parameters except for the initial num-
ber of atoms, fully agrees with our measurements.

Laser intensity noise, especially at twice the axial trap
frequency, causes heating of the atomic gas since ﬂuc-
tuations of the trap potential at this frequency exert
resonant work on the gas [10]. The resonator has a
the modes have a spatially well
mode-cleaning eﬀect:
deﬁned proﬁle and pointing- and shape ﬂuctuations of
the laser beam do not aﬀecting the shape of the trap po-
tential. However, these ﬂuctuations are converted to in-
tensity ﬂuctuations. Great care must therefore be taken
in choosing the drive laser: the absence of laser noise
especially at frequencies around 2ωax is crucial to ob-

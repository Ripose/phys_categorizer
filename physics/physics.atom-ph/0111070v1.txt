We numerically study the spatial diﬀusion of an atomic
cloud experiencing Sisyphus cooling in a three-dimensional
lin⊥lin optical lattice in a broad range of lattice parameters.
In particular, we investigate the dependence on the size of the
lattice sites which changes with the angle between the laser
beams. We show that the steady-state temperature is largely
independent of the lattice angle, but that the spatial diﬀusion
changes signiﬁcantly. It is shown that the numerical results
fulﬁl the Einstein relations of Brownian motion in the jumping
regime as well as in the oscillating regime. We ﬁnally derive an
eﬀective Brownian motion model from ﬁrst principles which
gives good agreement with the simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

internal state, the friction force has been shown to be
velocity-dependent [2,14],

Laser cooling and trapping was one of the major ad-
vances of the last part of the 20th century.
In 1997,
the Nobel prize in physics was awarded to Steven Chu,
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D. Phillips for
their works in this domain [1], in particular, for their
discovery of the Sisyphus cooling eﬀect [2] which permits
to achieve sub-Doppler temperatures and is widely used
in various diﬀerent laser cooling schemes [3]. The Sisy-
phus eﬀect in optical lattices [4] was studied in a large
variety of systems and of ﬁeld conﬁgurations. A large
number of results were obtained on temperature, local-
ization and spatial order [5] and an excellent agreement
between the experimental observations and the theoret-
ical predictions was found. Much less work has been
done to study the spatial diﬀusion in optical lattices, but
also for this problem a reasonable agreement was found
between the models [6–8] and the experiments [6,9–11].
However, no detailed study of the dependence of spa-
tial diﬀusion on, for example, the diﬀerent directions of
an anisotropic lattice or on the size and shape of lattice
sites has been performed so far. Very recently, optical
lattices and atomic transport therein has attracted new
attention with the study of quantum chaos [12] and the
achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation by purely op-
tical means [13].

Spatial diﬀusion in one-dimensional (1D) Sisyphus
cooling schemes is fairly well understood. In the so-called
jumping regime, where an atom undergoes several opti-
cal pumping cycles while moving over one optical wave-
length, the atomic motion can be understood by a simple

where vc denotes the capture velocity of Sisyphus cool-
ing.
In this situation, an analytical derivation of the
spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient has still be found [6], but an
interpretation in terms of a simple Brownian motion no
longer works. In particular, it is found in Ref. [6] that
the behavior of the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient as a func-
tion of the atom-light interaction parameters (laser light
intensity and detuning) is dramatically diﬀerent in the
oscillating regime compared to the jumping regime.

In higher dimensional setups, such a diﬀerence of the
spatial diﬀusion behaviors in the jumping and the oscil-
lating regimes is expected, too. Moreover, the important
diﬀerence of the mean free path of a diﬀusing atom in
these regimes may induce diﬀerent behaviors of the spa-
tial diﬀusion coeﬃcients as a function of the lattice peri-
ods. These are the main issues considered in the present
paper.

In this work we perform a detailed study of spatial dif-
lin lattice [15]. Using semi-
fusion in the so-called 3D-lin
⊥
classical Monte-Carlo simulations we ﬁnd that equalities
of the form of Eqs. (1) and (2) still hold in the oscillating
regime. This suggests that an interpretation by a Brow-
nian motion should still be possible. We derive such a
model from basic principles assuming a thermal spatial
distribution and taking into account some speciﬁc prop-
erties of our optical lattice and ﬁnd a good quantitative
agreement with the numerical results. In particular, we
calculate an eﬀective friction coeﬃcient α in a range of
parameters containing both the jumping and the oscil-
lating regimes. We ﬁnd that in the oscillating regime, α
increases with the lattice beam intensity and decreases
increases, in strong opposition to the friction

coeﬃcient α0 calculated in the jumping regime.

Our work is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we de-
scribe the speciﬁc laser and atom conﬁguration for the
3D optical lattice that we consider here and discuss sev-
eral important features of the optical potential surfaces.
In Sec. III, we present a physical picture of spatial diﬀu-
sion in periodic optical lattices and we particularly fore-
cast a dramatic change of the behavior of the spatial
diﬀusion coeﬃcients not only versus the atom-light in-
teraction parameters but also versus the geometrical pa-
rameters (spatial lattice periods) when going from the

jumping to the oscillating regime. In Sec. IV we derive
an eﬀective Brownian motion model which we compare
in the following sections with the numerical results on
the steady-state temperature (Sec. V) and on the spatial
diﬀusion (Sec. VI). Numerical results on the friction co-
eﬃcient are then discussed in Sec. VII and the validity of
the Einstein relations is shown. Finally, we summarize
our results in Sec. VIII.

crossed linear polarizations induce polarization and light shift
gradients in the three directions of space.

As in most theoretical work, we will consider atoms
with a ground state of angular momentum 1/2 and an
excited state of angular momentum 3/2. Experiments
usually fall into the low saturation regime deﬁned by

The Sisyphus eﬀect cools a cloud of multi-level atoms
when a laser ﬁeld induces spatially modulated optical po-
tentials and pumping rates in such a way that a moving
atom on average climbs up potential hills before it is op-
tically pumped into a lower lying potential surface [2]. In
this case kinetic energy is converted into potential energy
which is subsequently carried away by a spontaneously
emitted photon, thereby reducing the total atomic en-
ergy.

In this paper we study the so-called 3D-lin

lin conﬁg-
uration [15]. It is obtained from the standard 1D-lin
lin
conﬁguration [2] by symmetrically splitting each of the
two laser beams into two parts at an angle θx and θy,
respectively, with the (Oz) axis in the (Oxz) and (Oyz)
planes respectively. The resulting conﬁguration consists
of two pairs of laser beams in the (Oxz) plane and in the
(Oyz) plane, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1, with or-
thogonal linear polarizations. An important property of
this conﬁguration in contrast to 3D setups built of more
than four laser beams is that the interference pattern
and thus the topography of the lattice does not change
because of ﬂuctuations of the relative phase between the
various laser beams. Instead, such ﬂuctuations only in-
duce displacements of the lattice.

where s0 is the saturation parameter for an atomic tran-
sition with a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient of one, Ω0 is
the Rabi frequency for one laser beam, ∆ the detuning
of the laser beams from the atomic resonance frequency,
and Γ the natural width of the atomic excited state. This
domain is known to lead to the lowest temperatures. In
this situation we may adiabatically eliminate the Zeeman
sublevels of the excited state, leading to a theory which
only involves the ground state sublevels

then periodic in the three directions of space with periods
λi = 2π/ki. Equation (5) shows that U±(x, y, z) has the
same functional dependence on kxx and on kyy but a
diﬀerent one on kzz. We will therefore in the remainder
of the paper concentrate on a two-dimensional subsystem
only depending on x and z while ﬁxing y = 0. Previous
comparisons between 1D and 2D models have shown that
the general behavior of the dynamic variables is the same
in diﬀerent dimensions but that scaling factors appear
[6]. We thus expect that the results of our work give
physical interpretations to full 3D laser cooling schemes
but exact numerical values will be changed. Moreover, we
will assume a single lattice angle θ = θx = θy since this
gives rise to a vanishing mean radiation pressure force in
all directions. The general shape of the optical potential
is plotted in Fig. 2.

classical variables. This is obtained from the Wigner

The asymmetry between the x and z directions can

These have diﬀerent shapes and particularly the crossing
between both potential curves is higher in the transverse
direction (x) than it is in the longitudinal one (z). As we
will see later, this induces signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
cooling and diﬀusion properties.

A numerical solution of the FPE can be obtained by
averaging over many realizations of the corresponding
Lan-gevin equations [20]. Such a realization consists in
following the trajectory of a single atom which jumps
between the two optical potential surfaces corresponding
to the two internal states with the appropriate probabil-
ities. Between subsequent jumps the atom experiences

potential and radiation pressure forces as well as random
momentum kicks which mimic the momentum diﬀusion
according to the coeﬃcients of the FPE. We have per-
formed a large number of such semiclassical Monte-Carlo
simulations in order to investigate the dependence of the
steady-state temperature, the friction coeﬃcient, and in
particular the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient on the various
lattice parameters such as detuning ∆, light shift ∆′
0, and
lattice angle θ. We will discuss these numerical results
later in Secs. V, VI, and VII.

III. PHYSICAL PICTURE OF SPATIAL
DIFFUSION

⊥

As a result of the Sisyphus eﬀect, the atoms are cooled
and trapped in the potential wells and optical lattices are
usually described as atoms well conﬁned in regularly ar-
ranged sites (note that in the lin
lin lattice, the spatial
periods of these sites are λi/2, the trapping sites cor-
responding alternatively to U+ and U− potential wells).
However, in bright optical lattices the atom conﬁnement
is not perfect because of the strong interaction with the
laser light. Two diﬀerent processes then produce atomic
displacements between diﬀerent trapping sites, inducing
spatial diﬀusion (see Fig. 4). For the sake of simplicity,
we describe these processes in one dimension but they
occur analogously in higher dimensional setups.

On the one hand (see Fig. 4 left), a trapped atom still
undergoes ﬂuorescence cycles and thus takes random re-
coils due to photon absorption and re-emission. Hence,
the oscillating motion of the atom gets perturbed. Par-
ticularly, the atom can explore regions where its poten-
tial energy (U± if the atomic internal state is
) is not
minimum (U± > U∓). In such regions, optical pumping
cycles preferentially transfer the atom into the lower po-
tential curve and the atom is cooled and trapped in the
neighboring potential well (elementary Sisyphus cooling
process). This process induces atomic transfers from a
site to a neighboring one in another potential curve.

|±i

On the other hand (see Fig 4 right), when a trapped
atom oscillates in a potential well, it has a small but non
zero probability of being optically pumped into the up-
per potential curve. In the jumping regime the atom is
immediately pumped back into its initial trapping po-
tential well. This eﬀect thus induces heating and noisy
oscillating trajectory of the atom leading indirectly to
spatial diﬀusion via transfers between neighbouring po-
tential wells. On the contrary, in the oscillating regime
the atom is not immediately re-pumped and travels over
several potential wells before undergoing an elementary
Sisyphus cooling process again which traps it into an-
other potential well.

FIG. 4. Processes of spatial diﬀusion in an optical lattice.
Left: process due to the heating. Right: process due to optical
pumping.

The diﬀusion process linked to optical pumping is
much more eﬃcient than the one due to recoils except
for very small laser detunings [14]. We will thus focus on
the second process to describe spatial diﬀusion in peri-
odic multi-dimensional optical lattices. We will see that
the diﬀerences of this process in the jumping and the
oscillating regimes induce a dramatic diﬀerence in the
behavior of the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients.

In a simple model, we can describe the diﬀusive behav-
ior of the atomic cloud as random walks of atoms between
periodic trapping sites [21]. Let us assume that an atom
is trapped in one speciﬁc potential well and jumps after
a time τ to another well. The spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient

In the jumping regime, as discussed above, an atom

but our simple model does not provide its determina-
tion. Nevertheless, in the case of a strong anisotropy

to make certain assumptions on the stationary atomic
distribution.

We want to emphasize that these discussions are only
valid for lattice parameters far away from the domain
of d´ecrochage for spatial diﬀusion. For small potential
depths, rare long ﬂights dominate the diﬀusion which
therefore becomes anomalous [7].

IV. BROWNIAN MOTION MODEL

Before turning to a detailed discussion of the numeri-
cal results, we will now derive a simple analytical model
which will help to understand the main features of the
cooling scheme.

The basic idea of this model is to consider the atomic
dynamics as a Brownian motion, as it has been success-
fully applied to Doppler cooling [14] and 1D Sisyphus
cooling in the jumping regime [2,14], but taking some
properties of localization into account [23,24]. The fun-
damental ingredients are therefore the derivation of an
average friction force and an average momentum diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient.

Let us consider an atom at position r = xex + zez
moving with a constant velocity v = vxex + vzez. In this
case the FPE (11) reduces to

In 1D laser cooling one usually assumes a ﬂat spatial
distribution of the atoms in the lattice. However, as we
have seen in Sec. II, the shape of the 3D optical po-
tential diﬀers signiﬁcantly in the diﬀerent directions. In
particular the potential barrier between neighboring po-
tential wells is much higher in the transverse than in the
longitudinal direction. From Eq. (5) and Fig. 3 we see
that in the x direction the potential depth is of the order
∆′
of 16¯h
/3 whereas we will see later that the steady-

state temperature is of the order of 2¯h

we expect strong localization in that direction. On the
contrary, in the z direction the potential depth is of the
order of 8¯h
/3 and the atoms will be less localized.
Instead of a ﬂat spatial distribution of the atoms we will
thus assume a thermal distribution

perature T . Let us emphasize that assuming a thermal
distribution is not a priori justiﬁed for laser cooled sam-
ples but show signiﬁcant quantitative deviations from
such a simple behavior [25,26].
In fact, our numerical
simulations give actual spatial distributions in qualitative
agreement with Eq. 21 but show signiﬁcant quantitative
deviations from such a simple behavior. However, we
only use this approximation here to obtain a qualitative
understanding of the exact results obtained numerically
and we will see later that our results derived here are in
good quantitative agreement with the simulations.

Because of the symmetry of P (r), only terms contain-

The right hand side is obtained from Eqs. (24) and

Finally, we want to derive an approximate expression
for the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients. To this end, we
must again take the atomic localization into account.
While Eq. (1) for the relation between temperature, mo-
mentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient and friction coeﬃcient ap-
proximately holds for trapped and untrapped atoms,
the corresponding equation (2) for the spatial diﬀusion
only holds for free atoms. Indeed a cloud of completely
trapped atoms achieves a stationary spatial distribution
and hence shows no spatial diﬀusion. Using Eq. (29)
and the assumption of a thermal momentum and spatial
distribution, we calculate numerically that a fraction of

V. STEADY-STATE KINETIC TEMPERATURE

We performed a systematic study of the temperature
and the spatial diﬀusion as a function of the lattice pa-
rameters, exploring a large domain containing both the
jumping and the oscillating regime. More precisely, we
performed numerical semi-classical Monte-Carlo simula-
tions with the following parameters:

In this and the following sections we present the results
of the simulations and compare them with the analyti-
cal model discussed above. All of our discussions and
conclusions rely on the complete set of data, even if the
ﬁgures only contain a few sample curves for the sake of
clarity.

We ﬁrst study the atomic cloud steady-state tempera-
ture resulting from the competition between slowing and
heating processes. We calculate the average square ve-
locity over the whole atomic cloud at each time step of
the simulations. The temperature in direction i is then
given by

A second method to obtain the temperature numerically
is to ﬁt a Gaussian to the simulated momentum distribu-
tion. We have checked that the widths of these Gaussians
indeed give the same temperatures as those obtained
from Eq. (33). For a broad initial velocity distribution,

Let us ﬁrst concentrate on the oscillating regime,
Γ. In Fig. 6 we plot the temperature versus the
∆

lattice spatial period for various laser detunings and light
shifts in this domain. We ﬁnd that the temperature is
nearly independent of the lattice angle, i.e., of the spa-
tial periods. The temperature is thus strictly linear in
the potential depth and independent of any other lattice
parameter as predicted by Eq. (29). Such a property has
been observed experimentally [28] but we emphasize that
our result here holds for a broader range of parameters in
the oscillating regime as well as in the jumping regime.
A linear ﬁt to the numerical results gives

undergo eﬃcient Sisyphus cooling. Such an increase of
the cooling time is also observed in the longitudinal di-

does not reach very large values.

of Sisyphus cooling [2,14], cooling ends once an atom is
trapped in a single potential well and hence the steady-
state temperature is proportional to the potential depth.

As already discussed in Sec. IV this is about twice as
large in the transverse direction as in the longitudinal.
Hence, the transverse temperature would be expected to
be about twice as large as the longitudinal. However, cor-
relations between these two directions tend to equilibrate
the temperatures and in the simulations we therefore ﬁnd
Tx to be only about 1.4 times larger than Tz.

We now turn to the jumping regime,

< 10Γ. We
ﬁnd a completely diﬀerent behavior of the temperature.
This is a consequence of the increasing contribution of
absorption and spontaneous emission to the force ﬂuctu-
ations [28]. Physically, an atom experiences many pho-
ton recoils during one elementary cooling process and is
thus more likely to escape from the trapping potential.
Hence, the atom can reach a steady state temperature
larger than the potential well depth.

In Fig. 7 we plot the increase of the temperature com-
pared to the oscillating regime as a function of the lattice
periods λi. In excellent agreement with Eq. (34) we ﬁnd
that Ti is proportional to ∆′

The coeﬃcients of this ﬁt are in good quantitative agree-
ment with the analytical result (32). The main diﬀerence
is the factor of 1.39 which amounts to the diﬀerence be-
tween the longitudinal and the transverse temperatures
as found in Sec. V. Figure 8 shows that Eq. (37) yields
an excellent ﬁt to the numerical data. From Eq. (10) and
Eqs. (32), (37) we observe that the two domains where
DS behaves diﬀerently correspond to the jumping and
the oscillating regimes.

in good qualitative agreement with our physical discus-

tional to λ2

optical pumping rate Γ′
0. The diﬀerent values of the nu-
merical coeﬃcients indicate that the trapping is stronger
in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal, in
agreement with our discussion in Sec. IV.

In this regime, DS is proportional to ∆ as expected
from Eq. (14) and the angular dependence is qualita-
tively given by Eq. (32).
In Fig. 10 we show this an-
gular dependence in the oscillating regime. Here, the

10

transverse and longitudinal directions are not indepen-
dent because the potential wells signiﬁcantly deﬂect the
trajectories of atoms travelling over many optical poten-
tial wells. The dependence of DSi on θ thus contains
both λx and λz. This is dramatically diﬀerent to the
situation in the jumping regime where atoms only jump
between adjacent wells. Equation (39) also conﬁrms that
for λi
λj, DSi does not depend on λi as predicted in
≪
Sec. III.

simulations and the lines correspond to Eq. (39) (oscillating

VII. FRICTION FORCE

The theoretical model of Sec. IV was based on the de-
scription of the atomic dynamics by a Brownian motion
model. Let us now further investigate the validity of
such a description by testing in the numerical simula-
tions some characteristics of Brownian motion. We par-
ticularly perform a direct numerical measurement of the
friction coeﬃcients and test the validity of the Einstein
relation (2).

In order to probe the atomic dynamics we submit the
atoms to a constant, space and velocity independent force
in addition to the forces due to the atom-light interaction.
In an experiment this could be provided simply by gravity
or, for example, by the radiation pressure force of an
additional weak laser beam. In a Brownian motion model
such a constant force F(c) = F (c)

.

(40)

Because of the linearity of the Brownian equations of
motion the kinetic temperature and the spatial diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are not changed.

Adding such a constant force in the numerical simula-
tions along the i-direction, we observed in fact that the
atomic cloud experiences a drift in this direction at a
constant velocity. In the ideal case of a pure Brownian

motion any amplitude of F(c) can be used, but in the
case of Sisyphus cooling the friction coeﬃcient is veloc-
ity dependent. In order to get vi proportional to F (c)
,
it is thus essential to use a small enough force which in-
duces a global drift much smaller than the width of the
velocity distribution. Under this condition the tempera-
ture and the spatial diﬀusion do not depend on F(c) and
Eq. (40) can be used to numerically ﬁnd unique friction
coeﬃcients αi.

i

We can then compare these numerical results with
the friction coeﬃcient obtained via the Einstein relation
(2) using the numerically found values of the tempera-
ture (see Sec. V) and of the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient
(Sec. VI). In Fig. 11 we plot the ratio of these two friction
coeﬃcients and ﬁnd deviations of about 15%. Hence, the
dynamics of an atomic cloud in an optical lattice is in
reasonable agreement with a two-dimensional Brownian
motion model. Note that the eigen-directions of the mo-
tion are the x and z directions in good agreement with
the theoretical model.

FIG. 11. Ratio of the friction coeﬃcients calculated with
′
0|/ωr = 150,

Eq. (40) and with Eq. (2) for various ∆ and for |∆
300, 450.

In order to better understand this result let us brieﬂy
return to the model developed in Sec. IV. As has been
shown in the previous section, the numerically obtained
diﬀusion coeﬃcient agrees well with the analytical result
(32).
In the derivation of the latter we have assumed
that the cloud of atoms can be split into a trapped frac-
tion and into a free fraction. Only the free atoms were
taken into account for the spatial diﬀusion. Similar argu-
ments must also be considered for the friction coeﬃcient.

11

i

v
h

Adding a small constant force will leave a trapped par-
ticle in its initial potential well, and therefore the frac-
tion of trapped atoms does not contribute to the mean
velocity
of the cloud. Thus, the measured friction
coeﬃcient using Eq. (40) should be given by the ana-
lytical result (24) divided by the fraction of free atoms.
Hence, for the measured values of the spatial diﬀusion
and of the friction both sides of Eq. (2) are corrected
by the same factor.
In other words, the Einstein rela-
tion holds because the measured quantities only involve
the freely travelling atoms for which a Brownian motion
model works well.

Therefore, we obtain an analytic ﬁt to the measured
friction coeﬃcient by inserting Eqs. (35) and (37) into
Eq. (2). We ﬁnd

These approximate expressions are compared with the
numerically obtained values of the friction coeﬃcient in
Fig. 12. We see that there is excellent agreement both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

and the oscillating regime. In the jumping regime, αi is

However, Fig. 12 exhibit a small dependence of αi versus
∆′

the model. In fact, the kinetic temperature is not pro-
portional but linear in ∆′
0 and this induce a dependence
of the spatial distribution P in ∆′
0. Coeﬃcients Ci are
thus ∆′
0-dependent and this can explain the discrepancy.
In the oscillating regime, αi is proportional to Γ′

ering the free atoms which contribute to spatial diﬀusion

fulﬁlled. This supports a description of the dynamics in
terms of Brownian motion. The friction coeﬃcient αi is
proportional to ∆ and 1/λ2
i in the jumping regime. In
the oscillating regime, αi is proportional to ∆′
0 and 1/∆,
and the dependence on the lattice geometry involves both
1/λx and 1/λz.

The numerical results have been found to be in good
agreement with a simple theoretical model based on a
semi-classical approach. We derive the steady-state tem-
perature, the friction force, and the spatial diﬀusion from
a model of Brownian motion taking into account atomic
localization in the optical potential wells. To explain
the measured friction and spatial diﬀusion, the atomic
cloud must be split into a trapped part and a free part.
While in general both parts contribute to the internal
and external dynamics, only the free fraction of atoms is
responsible for the observed expansion of the cloud and
for the drift of the center of mass under the inﬂuence of
a weak constant force.

The spatial diﬀusion of atomic clouds in optical lat-
tices is usually studied in pump-probe spectroscopy ex-
periments, using the properties of the Rayleigh line [30].
However, the validity of this method has never been
proven. We expect that the models discussed here will
serve to this veriﬁcation by providing a systematic the-
oretical study of the directly measured spatial diﬀusion
coeﬃcients.
Finally,

it should be noted that our restriction to
θx = θy has been guided by experimental restrictions
but is not necessary. Indeed, when this condition is not
fulﬁlled, the unbalanced radiation pressure induces a fast
escape of the atomic cloud from the optical lattice which
makes experimental investigations diﬃcult. Neverthe-
less, this situation could be of great interest because it
oﬀers the opportunity of studying optical lattices with
diﬀerent spatial periods along the x and y axes and in-
teresting anisotropic eﬀects could be found.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we performed a systematic study of the
behavior of an atomic cloud in a lin
lin optical lattice
with the help of semi-classical Monte-Carlo simulations.
We explored a broad range of lattice parameters includ-
ing the jumping and the oscillating regime.

⊥

The temperature was found to be linear in the poten-
tial depth and independent of the laser detuning and of
the lattice angle in a broad range of parameters. We have
shown that the temperature is anisotropic, the transverse
one being larger than the longitudinal one by a factor of
1.4. All these results are well explained with the help of
the physical picture of Sisyphus cooling and are in good
agreement with experimental results.

lattice spatial periods is also diﬀerent in both regimes:
whereas DSi is proportional to λ2

it is a function of λx as well as λz in the oscillating regime.
This reveals correlations between the transverse and lon-

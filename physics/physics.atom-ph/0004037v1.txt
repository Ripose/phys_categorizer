Abstract

Small parts of the electronic wavepacket of a multiple charged ion may still

tunnel through the high Coulomb barrier for a suﬃciently intense laser ﬁeld of

1015W/cm2 and higher. Solving numerically the corresponding Schr¨odinger

equation we ﬁnd that the periodic recollisions of such a wavepacket in the

oscillating high power laser ﬁeld will give rise to coherent X-ray radiation in

the multiple keV regime, i.e. substantially higher than predicted or observed

before.

Since the invention of the laser, scientists have tried to generate coherent light also far

below the optical wavelength [1]. The striking advantages in high resolution measurements

and imaging are doubtless. All X-ray lasers up to date however still lack the eﬃciency,

size, price and in particular coherence properties of optical laser schemes.

In one of the

most promising mechanisms for coherent high frequency generation, high power near optical

laser ﬁelds were imposed on atomic systems. Parts of the electron wavepackets are then

oscillating through the ionic core and due to the nonlinear interaction with the nucleus give

rise to multiples of the applied laser frequency, i.e. harmonics [2]. In the so called tunneling

regime only very small parts of the wavepackets tunnel through the laser modiﬁed Coulomb

barrier but when returning the so far highest orders of harmonics were observed [3,4]. The

highest possible achievable photon energy has been determined theoretically to give the so

called cut-oﬀ law [5–7]

nmax¯hω = Ip + 3.2Up

(1)

with the ionisation potential Ip, the ponderomotive energy Up = E2/4ω2, ¯h the Planck

constant, nmax the maximal order of harmonics and E and ω being the maximal amplitude

and angular frequency of the applied laser ﬁeld.

The above simple formular was then explained in a simple three step model [8]: (i) parts

from the bound electron wavepacket tunnel through the Coulomb barrier at the time when

the laser ﬁeld is close to its maximum and is suﬃciently narrow for a substantial tunnel

rate (ii) the born wavepackets oscillates freely and classically in the laser ﬁeld and when

returning has picked up the kinetic or ponderomotive energy 3.2 Up and (iii) at the return

with the nucleus may at best drop back to the ground state of energy −Ip and release in
form of radiation the ionisation energy Ip and all the gained kinetic energy 3.2 Up. If this

process is repeated several times, interference among those processes leads to coherence of

the generated light [9].

Many attempts have been made to enhance the above cut-oﬀ rule for the beneﬁt of even

higher coherent high frequency generation. By preparing the atomic ensemble appropriately

2

prior the interaction with the laser ﬁeld or turning to more complex systems as molecules,

the factor 3.2 could be enhanced to at best the order of 10 [9]. In principle the Up could be

strongly increased by several orders of magnitude with present laser technology by increasing

the driving laser ﬁeld strength up to the relativistic regime [10]. However, the Coulomb

barrier of neutral atoms is then modiﬁed so strongly that the above described three step

model does not apply anymore and instead often only Bremsstrahlung harmonics arise.

A large experimental enhancement was recently achieved independently by the groups

of Krausz [11] and by that of Murnane and Kapteyn [12] where ultra short pulses were

employed. With at about 500 eV they have generated the shorted coherent wavelength so

far and have entered the so called water window where optical imaging of living species in

water is possible. The break through was possible essentially because of the use of very

short pulses which allowed to move quickly to the highest intensity of the laser pulse before

too much of the ground state wavepacket was lost. In spite of this dramatic improvement

a draw back of the short pulses is that only few recollisions of born wavepackets with the

atomic core are possible and thus the coherence properties of the generated light are limited.

In this Letter we present a way to enhance high harmonic generation towards the hard

X-ray regime, maintaining still high coherence properties. For this purpose we propose to

use multiply charged ions [13,14] rather than atoms because they possess a considerably

larger ionization potential Ip and according to the cut-oﬀ rule Eq.(1) promise a far larger

maximal harmonic order. Since relativistic corrections turned out negligible for the low ion

charges of interest here, we solve numerically the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation. For

each eﬀective ion charge we evaluate the appropriate laser electric ﬁeld strength to allow

for tunneling and recollision harmonic generation. For a charge of Z = 3 of the ionic core

as sensed by the active electron, harmonics up to the order 2500 arise, i.e. with a photon

energy of more than 4 keV.

The parameter that has been employed so far to estimate if the laser and atomic param-

eters are such that the three step tunnel mechanism takes place is the Keldysh parameter

the ionization potential for hydrogen. If this parameter is well below unity, one is

in the tunneling regime. To have signiﬁcant tunneling and thus harmonic intensity, we need

a small γ. However to avoid substantial ionization this parameter should not be too small.

Following ref. [16] tunneling decreases exponentially with Z 3 and a Up increasing with Z 6

is necessary to compensate for this. As this is only an estimation for our model potential

we have considered and optimized the tunneling dynamics also via numerical studies prior

calculating the spectrum. We show in fact that we have to decrease the γ parameter with

increasing charge of the ion strongly to ensure a suﬃciently large tunneling rate and thus

high harmonic output.

The laser ﬁeld strength employed do not exceed the order of 2 · 1016W/cm2 so that due
the laser ﬁeld we do not enter the relativistic regime. Concerning the interaction of the

electronic wavepacket with the ionic core we employ a net charge of up to Z = 3. This

can also be assumed as non relativistic; a corresponding calculation via the Dirac equation

will thus give essentially equal results. For more highly charged ions the velocities close to

the nucleus can be signiﬁcant as compared to the speed of light c so that the laser Lorentz

force term can be nonnegligible as compared to the laser electric ﬁeld [15]. This term would

then give rise to complex modiﬁcations to the recollision dynamics and thus to the harmonic

spectrum but is not of interest to the nonrelativistic regime of interest here [17].

With those assumptions in mind we consider the following dynamical equation for the

electronic wavefunction Ψ(x, t) as a function of the spatial coordinate x in the direction of

the linearly polarized laser light and the time t:

i∂tΨ(x, t) = HSΨ(x, t)

where HS stands for the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian with:

HS =

2  p −

A(t)

c !2

+ V (x, Z)

(3)

(4)

where the vector potential of the laser pulse is deﬁned via A(t) = E · h(t) · sin(ωt). The
electric ﬁeld E·h(t) involves a pulse shape h(t) with turn-on phase and a phase with constant
amplitude during which we evaluate the radiation spectrum.

We use the regularized nuclear potential,

V (x, Z) = −

k

√x2 + s

(5)

where s = 2 is a smoothing parameter of the nucleus to compensate for the neglect of the

second and third dimension [18]. k is a direct function of the net charge Z of the ion and

can be adjusted to recover the experimental values for the binding energies.

In our numerical analysis for hydrogen (H) and hydrogen like ions (He+, Li2+) interacting

with short intense laser pulses, we employed a laser wave length of λ = 800nm (TiSapphire),
− 1016W/cm2 and pulse lengths between
an electric ﬁeld amplitude with intensity I ∼ 1014
20 and 200 cycles with a turn-on phase of 5 to 20 cycles. In ﬁg. 1 we displayed the eﬀective

potentials for H, He+ and Li2+ in the laser pulse at the time of maximal electric ﬁeld and as

a horizontal line the corresponding ground state energy. For the case of hydrogen we have

chosen the laser parameters (γK = 0.89) such that we are well in the tunneling regime but

simultaneously such that ionization is still small. When moving to He+ we ﬁrst increased

the electric ﬁeld strength by a factor of two only to obtain the same Keldysh parameter

and note from the corresponding dashed line for the eﬀective potential in Fig. 1 that the

tunneling barrier is then very large and that we appear to be in the intermediate regime to

the multiphoton regime. While the ionization potential scales with Z 2, the tunneling rate

reduces expotenially with Z 3/E [16]. In the solid line for He+ we have further increased the

electric ﬁeld strength such that we have similar ionization as for H above, however though

with a smaller γK.

Before addressing Li2+, we discuss Fig. 2 where we have displayed the radiation spectrum

corresponding to the situations in H (a) and the two cases for He+ displayed in Fig. 1.

For H we are in the tunneling regime and thus ﬁnd as well known a plateau and cut-

oﬀ following Eq. (1).

In Fig 2(b) for increasing Ip and Up by a factor of two we ﬁnd a

5

spectrum with the expected cut-oﬀ enhanced by a factor of Z 2 = 4. However, even though

γK is unchanged we have clearly moved towards the multi photon regime. The harmonic

structure has detoriated and we ﬁnd even resonance structures in the low frequency part of

the spectrum. The enhancement of about the 12th harmonic corresponds to the transition

from the ﬁrst excited to the ground state. Also we note a beginning of a tilting of the

spectrum in the plateau area. To reenter the tunneling regime, we have increased the E ﬁeld

further, such that the ionization rate becomes comparable to that for H in Fig. 1 a) and

found an up-conversion of the cut-oﬀ frequency by a factor of 10.

We continue the procedure for Li2+ as depicted in the lowest entry of Fig. 1. We have

increased the electric ﬁeld with respect to H not only by a factor 3 but substantially more

to secure suﬃcient tunneling. However, for such high harmonics as expected here and the

corresponding low eﬃciency we chose a long pulse for a clear resolution of the very high

harmonics. This requires us to maintain a suﬃciently wide ionization barrier somewhat

larger than in the two previous cases and thus accept a spectrum with a less pronounced

cut-oﬀ frequency. Still we achieve at about 2500 harmonics as visible in Fig. 3, i.e. hard

X-ray harmonics with an energy of at about 4 keV. We note that sometimes in the literature

those energies are still counted to the upper end of soft X-rays. However, proceeding to

higher charged ions, even higher harmonics are achievable, though with an increasingly small

eﬃciency. Given the available parameters we note a scaling law of at about Z 3 for the energy

of the cut-oﬀ harmonics as a function of the ion charge and the correspondingly chosen laser

ﬁeld intensity. We note that for practical reasons we have increased the intensity with rising

charge Z rather than modifying the frequency which is less controllable experimentally. A

constant wavelength of the applied laser ﬁeld may however be problematic, since relative

to the modiﬁed characteristic length of the ionic core due to the variable Z, one may need

adapt the time available for tunneling.

Moving towards the relativistic regime [10] with higher laser intensities and ionic charges,

higher harmonics are possible. However, the harmonic spectrum deviates further from the

traditional structure in the tunneling regime including a horizontal plateau and a well pro-

6

nounced cut-oﬀ. The magnetic component of the laser ﬁeld induces a signiﬁcant momentum

transfer in the propagation direction of the laser ﬁeld. This makes recollisions more diﬃ-

cult, especially involving long return times after many free oscillations in the laser ﬁeld. As

a consequence we ﬁnd a reduction of harmonics between the perturbative and the cut-oﬀ

regime. This goes beyond the scope of this letter and will be discussed in detail in future

work [17].

In conclusion multiply charged ions still allow for tunneling and recollisions of electron

wave packets with the parent ionic core with laser ﬁeld intensities well above those employed

before for high harmonic generation with atoms. Consequently coherent X-rays become

feasible in the multiple keV regime. The eﬃciency is below that for coherent high harmonic

generation via laser driven atoms.

Astrophysically important electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) transition am-

plitudes for the low-lying states of quadruply ionized vanadium are presented very accurately.

Most of these results are reported for the ﬁrst time in the literature. Relativistic coupled-

cluster theory with single, double and leading triple excitations approximation has been

employed for these calculations. Behaviors of diﬀerent correlation eﬀects arising through the

above theory have been highlighted by studying core and valence electrons excitations to the

excited states. We also observe long lifetime for the ﬁrst excited D- state.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Electromagnetic forbidden transitions, especially for lighter systems and their iso-electronic

companions, are of immense important in atomic experiments due to precise use of metastable

states [1]. Some of these transitions correspond to relatively longer wavelengths compared to

normal allowed transitions of same system providing the thermal Doppler eﬀects in many physical

systems [2]. They also provide important astronomical features in infrared and radio regions. Many

of these forbidden transitions of quadruply ionized vanadium (V4+) have been related to dominant

features in the optical spectra of planetary nebulae and the aurora [3]. Similar transitions have been

identiﬁed with the so called coronal lines emitted by the Sun [4]. Under certain circumstances,

which prevail in astrophysics and low density laboratory tokamak plasmas, electric quadrupole

(E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) transition lines gain intensity and can be used to infer information

about plasma temperature and their dynamics. The intensities of these transitions allow us to

measure the concentration of impurity ions in tokamak which originate in the high temperature

interior of the discharge [5]. From many-body points of view, the importance of these results lies

2

in the estimation of the accuracy of the electronic wave function through out the radial extent of

the atomic systems by comparing the results with experimental measurements, wherever available,

and estimated results, where experiments are diﬃcult.

The electric dipole transitions of V4+ are equivalently important in astronomy and we had

performed accurate calculations on those transitions among bound states in our previous work [6]

(Here after we refer it as Paper-I) for the ﬁrst time in the literature. Here, we present calculated

wavelengths and transition amplitudes of V4+ involving E2 and M1 radiative transition amplitudes

which are important in astronomy (as mentioned above), plasma research and can be used in many

experiments in atomic and solid state physics [7, 8, 12]. The forbidden transitions between the ﬁne

structure states of the low-lying D-states play important role in the study of impurity in Al2O3

crystal which is used to study high-frequency acoustic phonon in crystal [9].

It is also a good

candidate to study electron spin resonance [10] and electron paramagnetic resonance [11] in quartz

material. The detail knowledge of the resonant core relaxation process of V+4 [13] need accurate

results of energy levels of this ion and transition amplitudes among them.

One of the most successful many-body approaches, the relativistic coupled cluster method with

singles, doubles and partially triples (RCCSD(T)) which is non-perturbative in nature, has been

employed to estimate the important properties of V4+ like forbidden transition amplitudes and

lifetimes of most of the low-lying states of the system. We also investigate the core-core and

core-valence correlation contributions obtained from the RCCSD(T) method to the M1 and E2

transitions among these low-lying states.

coupled-cluster (CC) approach as

For the one-valence (v) open shell system, the exact wave function can be expressed using

where the curly brackets represent the normal order form and the reference state is deﬁned by

|Ψvi = eT {eSv }|Φvi = eT {1 + Sv}|Φvi,

|Φvi = a†

v|ΦDF i

(1.1)

(1.2)

for the closed-shell Dirac-Fock (DF) state, |ΦDF i, of V+5.

In the above equation, the T and Sv operators are the CC excitation operators associate with the

closed and open shell hole-particle excitations, respectively [14, 15]. The computationally intensive

part in this approach is to consider non-linear terms which involves maximum four powers of

single (T1) and two powers of double (T2) normal ordered core-excitation operators and products

with valence-virtual single excitation operators, S1v, and core-valence-virtual double excitation

operators, S2v, [16]. Leading order triple excitations [16, 17] are obtained in combination with

the above mentioned T and Sv operators. For computational simplicity, the T amplitudes are

calculated ﬁrst for the closed-shell V 5+ then the corresponding valence orbitals are attached to

calculate the open-shell wave functions [18].

The DF orbitals are generated from the universal Gaussian type orbital (GTO) basis functions

[30] using α0 = 0.00825 and β = 2.91. Number of DF orbitals for diﬀerent symmetries used in the

CC calculations are based on convergent criteria of core correlation energy for which it satisﬁes

numerical completeness. There are only 12, 10, 10, 9 and 8 active orbitals including all core

electrons are considered in the RCCSD(T) calculations for l = 0,1,2,3,4 symmetries, respectively,

and other higher energy orbitals are not considered due to negligible correlation contribution.

The matrix element of any operator D can be expressed using the CC method as

Df i =

hΨf |D|Ψii
hΨf |Ψii

=

hΦf |{1 + Sf
hΦf |{1 + Sf

†}eT †DeT {1 + Si}|Φii

where [jf ] = 2jf + 1 is the degeneracy of the f -state, S is the square of the transition amplitudes
of the transition operator D, and λ (in(˚A)) are the corresponding transition wavelength.

The lifetime (in sec) of a particular state is the reciprocal of total transition probabilities arising

from all possible electromagnetic spontaneous transitions to the lower energy levels. In Paper-I,

we have found excellent agreement between the experimental and computed ionization energies

using the RCCSD(T) approach. The good agreement between length and velocity gauged electric

dipole transition matrix elements in the above paper demonstrates the accuracy of our numerical

approach. Here we are reporting the forbidden transition amplitudes among low-lying bound states

and lifetimes of some of the above mentioned important excited states. These forbidden transition

amplitudes reported in this paper and allowed (from Paper-I) transition probabilities obtained from

the same RCCSD(T) calculation as Paper-I. From the calculated lifetimes presented in table I, we

see that the 3d5/2 state has long lifetime and can be used as a potential metastable states required

for many atomic experiments. Ali and Kim [20] had calculated M1 and E2 transition probabilities

between 3d and 4s states using Dirac-Fock single-conﬁguration (DFSC) approximation. We have

compared our results with these results in Table II. The diﬀerence between the results are due to

the inclusion of electron correlation eﬀects through the RCCSD(T) method. It is clear from this

table that the magnetic dipole matrix element between 3d3/2 and 4s was highly underestimated in

the DFSC calculation.

The eﬀect of the unbound orbitals in the correlation of the excitation wavelengths (other way to

say, excitation energies) and the E2 and M1 transition probabilities in the framework of the RCC

approach is studied quantitatively in Tables III and IV respectively, which is reported ﬁrst time

in the literature to our knowledge. We have considered transitions involving few excited states

close to and few comparatively away from the ground state. As expected, the eﬀect is more on the

higher excited states compared to the excited states those are closed to the ground state, and in

some cases it changes by order of magnitudes, like transition between the ﬁne structure states of

6p.

Tables V and VI give the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transition amplitudes, re-

spectively, for most of the low-lying states. They are all relevant astrophysically. The important

transitions among these are forbidden transitions from ﬁne-structure states of 3d and 4p. Former

one falls in the infrared region, which has many applications in plasma research and infrared laser

spectroscopy [21] and latter one falls in the optical region, has immense prospect in diﬀerent atomic

physics experiments. We have not made wavelength comparison for most of other ﬁne structure

transitions between the NIST [23] and our calculated values which fall far beyond the infrared

region. The relatively large diﬀerence in wavelengths between some of the transitions from 4f

states call for further experimental and theoretical investigations on this state.

Contributions from diﬀerent correlation terms for few low-lying M1 and E2 transitions from

tables V and VI are presented in tables VII, VIII and IX. From these comparison of transition

amplitudes obtained from the DF and the RCC calculations, we see the importance of correlation

contributions to diﬀerent transitions. These tables show that core-polarization eﬀects (DS2i coming

from the initial state for all the transitions are negligible. Wheras the combined eﬀects of S2

operators of both initial and ﬁnal states contributing signiﬁcantly for both M1 and E2 transitions

amplitudes.

II. CONCLUSION

Lifetimes of the low-lying bound states of V+4 have been calculated using highly correlated

relativistic coupled-cluster approach. Long lifetimes have been observed for the ﬁrst excited D-

states. Magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transition amplitudes among bound states of the

system those are important for astronomical observations and plasma researches are estimated for

the ﬁrst time in the literature for most of the cases. Especially, forbidden transitions between

the ﬁne structure 4p states may be considered for diﬀerent atomic experiments due to its optical

transition line. We have also highlighted diﬀerent correlation eﬀects arising through the RCCSD(T)

method.

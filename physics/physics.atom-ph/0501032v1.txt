On the use of the V N −M approximation in atomic calculations.

V. A. Dzuba∗

(Dated: February 2, 2008)
We demonstrate that V N−M approximation is a good starting point for the conﬁguration interac-
tion calculations for many-electron atoms and ions. N is the total number of electrons in the neutral
atom, M is the number of valence electrons. V N−M is the self-consistent Hartree Fock potential for a
closed-shell ion with all valence electrons removed. Using of the V N−M approximation considerably
simpliﬁes the many-body perturbation theory for the core-valence correlations. It makes it easier to
include higher-order correlations which often signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of the calculations.
Calculations for krypton and barium and their positive ions are presented for illustration.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic physics is a valuable tool to study many fun-
damental problems. It is used to study parity and time
invariance violating interactions (see, e.g.
[1]), possible
variation of the fundamental constants in quasar absorp-
tion spectra [2] and in present-day experiments by com-
paring the rates of diﬀerent atomic clocks [3], etc. How-
ever, interpretation of the atomic measurements is often
limited by accuracy of atomic calculations. For example,
the accuracy of the most precise measurements of atomic
parity non-conserving eﬀects (PNC) in atoms which has
been achieved for cesium is 0.35% [4]. The accuracy of
the best calculations is from 0.5% to 1% [5, 6, 7, 8].
Situation is even worse for thallium. Experimental ac-
curacy of the PNC measurements is 1% [9] while best
theoretical accuracy is from 2.5% [10] to 3% [11]. On
this level of accuracy there is perfect agreement of the
PNC measurements with the standard model and any
further progress would need signiﬁcant improvement in
atomic theory. There are many other examples where
accurate atomic calculations are needed. These include
atomic clocks, quantum computations, plasma physics,
etc. Therefore, it is worth to study the ways of improv-
ing the methods of calculations.

It is well known that the perturbation theory in resid-
ual Coulomb interaction converge very poorly for many
electron atoms and some all-order technique is needed
to achieve good accuracy of calculations. For atoms with
one external electron above closed shells there are at least
two all-order methods which lead to a fraction of percent
accuracy in calculation of the energies as compared to
experimental data. One is an all-order correlation poten-
tial method (also called perturbation theory in screened
Coulomb interaction) [12]. Another is linearized coupled
cluster approach (CC)[13]. For atoms with more than one
external electron good accuracy can be achieved when
diﬀerent methods are combined to include correlations
between valence electrons together with the core-valence

correlations. This can be done by combining conﬁgu-
ration interaction method with the many-body pertur-
bation theory (CI+MBPT) [14] or CC method with the
MBPT [15] or with the CI method [16].

The key question in developing of all these methods is
where to start or what potential to chose to generate a
complete set of single-electron states. It is well accepted
now that the Hartree Fock potential is the best choice for
the perturbation theory expansion. This is because self-
consistency condition leads to exact cancellation between
Coulomb and potential terms in the residual interaction
so that potential terms are completely eliminated from
the perturbation theory expansion. The natural choice
for atoms with one external electron is the V N −1 Hartree

approximation the self-consistency procedure is initially
done for a closed-shell positive ion. States of external
electron are then calculated in the ﬁeld of frozen core.
There is exact cancellation between direct and exchange
self-action terms in the Hartree Fock potential for closed
shell systems. Therefore, by including self-action, we can
easily see that states in the core and states above core
are calculated in the same potential. Other words, V N −1
potential generates a complete set of orthogonal single-
electron states which are convenient for use in the pertur-
bation theory expansion. Using this set in an appropriate
all-oder method leads to very good results for a neutral
atom in spite of the fact that the core of the atom is
actually the core of a positive ion.

The V N −1 approximation can also be used for atoms
with more than one external electron. However, in this
case the system of N − 1 electrons is most likely to be
an open-shell system and some averaging procedure is
needed to deﬁne the V N −1 potential. Another compli-
cation arise when core-valence correlation are to be in-
cluded by means of MBPT. There is no exact cancellation
between potential terms any more. The potential in the
eﬀective Hamiltonian is now V N −M potential, where M
is number of valence electrons and M > 1. Perturba-
tion theory expansion would have terms proportional to
V N −M − V N −1. These terms are called subtraction dia-
grams [14] or ∆-terms [18]. The number of these terms
is larger than number of pure Coulomb terms and this

represents signiﬁcant complication of the MBPT. These
terms can be totally avoided if calculations from the very
beginning are done in the V N −M potential. However, it
is widely believed that doing calculations for a neutral
atom by starting from a highly charged ion would lead
to poor convergence of the perturbation expansion and
poor end results. Indeed, after the initial Hartree Fock
procedure is done the core is kept frozen in all conse-
quent calculations. No further perturbation expansion
can change anything in the core, leaving it to be the core
of the highly charged ion.

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the
core of the highly charged ion is often not very much
diﬀerent from the core of neutral atom and V N −M ap-
proximation can be a good approximation for atoms with
several valence electrons. The main gain is total elimi-
nation of subtraction diagrams. This signiﬁcantly sim-

higher-order core-valence correlations in the V N −M ap-
proximation.
Inclusion of higher-oder correlations can
signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of the calculations.

We consider CI+MBPT calculations for neutral kryp-
ton and barium and their positive ions to illustrate the
advantage of the V N −M approximation.

II. CALCULATIONS

A. Krypton.

Let’s start our consideration from an extreme case - an
atom with eight valence electrons. The purpose of this
example is to illustrate that even removal of as many as
eight electrons do not lead to any dramatic changes in the
atomic core and V N −8 approximation is still reasonably
good approximation for the neutral atom as well as for
the all chain of positive ions starting from number of
valence electrons M = 1 and up to M = 8.

Table I compares core states of Kr I and Kr IX. Calcu-
lations are done in V N and V N −8 potentials respectively.
We present singe-electron energies, overage radius (hri),
square root of overage square radius (hr2i1/2), position of
the maximum of the wave function (r(fmax)), the value
in the maximum (fmax) as well as the range of distances
where 80% of the electron density is located (from r1 to
r2). It is easy to see that changing from V N to V N −8 po-
tential has large eﬀect on the energies of core states but

states change almost two times while overage radius (or
square root of overage square radius) changes by about
2-3% only, position of the maximum does not change at
all and the value of the wave function in the maximum
changes by about 1% only.

To understand this behavior one should look at the
distances where electrons are localized. As can be seen
from Table I valence electrons (4s and 4p) are localized at
signiﬁcantly larger distances than core electrons. There

is almost no overlap between densities of core and valence
electrons. Indeed, 90% of the density of the 4s and 4p
electrons are at distances r > aB (0.95ab for the 4s state
and 1.1aB for the 4p state) while 90% of the density of
the uppermost core state 3d is at r < 0.907aB. This
means that valence states can only create constant ﬁeld
inside the core. For example

Correction to the energy of a core state is given by diag-
onal matrix element

This matrix element is large.

In contrast, correction to wave function is given by
oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements. These matrix elements are
small due to orthogonality of wave functions:

ψn(r)†ψm(r)Y0(r)dr ≈ Const

ψn(r)†ψm(r)dr = 0.

We see that the removal of eight valence electrons from

change in energy denominators. But what is more im-
portant is the absence of the subtraction diagrams which
makes the MBPT to be much more simple. Excitation
energies are larger in Kr IX than in Kr I which means
that MBPT terms are smaller and convergence is likely
to be better. Therefore, it is natural to assume that the
V N −8 approximation is a good initial approximation for
all krypton ions starting from Kr IX and up to neutral
Kr I, with number of valence electrons ranges from none
to eight. We have performed the calculations to check
this.

Hartree Fock energy of the 3d5/2 state of Kr IX (8.645
a.u., see Table I) agrees within 2% with the experimental
ionization energy of Kr IX (8.488 a.u., [19]). The diﬀer-
ence should be mostly attributed to the correlations.

We can do much better calculations for Kr VIII. It has
one valence electron above closed shells. We calculate
its states in the ﬁeld of frozen core (V N −8 potential) in
Hartree Fock and Brueckner approximations. The lat-
ter means that we modify the HF equations for valence
electron by including correlation potential ˆΣ (see [20] for
details). We calculate ˆΣ in second order of MBPT. The
results are presented in Table II. As can be seen Hartree
Fock energies diﬀer from experiment by about 1% while
inclusion of correlations improves them signiﬁcantly brin-
ing the agreement to better than 0.1%.

We use the combined CI+MBPT method for ions with
more than one valence electron [14]. Like in standard
CI method the Schr¨odinger equation is written for the
many-electron wave function of valence electrons

ˆΣ2 is the two-electron part of core-valence correlations.
It represents screening of Coulomb interaction between
valence electrons by core electrons. We also calculate ˆΣ2
in the second order of MBPT. The details of the calcula-
tion of ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 can be found elsewhere [14, 21]. Note
however that in contrast to the cited works we now have
no subtraction diagrams.

Only number of electrons changes in the eﬀective
Hamiltonian (3) when we move from Kr VII (M = 2)
to Kr I (M = 8) while terms V N −8, ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2 remain
exactly the same.

The results for ground state energy of removal all
valence electrons are compared with experiment in Ta-
ble III. Accuracy of calculations for all ions and neutral
atom are similar and always better than 2%.

To compare the V N and V N −8 approximations we have
also performed calculations of the ground state energy of
Kr I in V N potential with the same size of the basis set
and with core-valence correlations included in the second
order of MBPT (including subtraction diagrams). The
result is -18.377 a.u. which diﬀers by only 0.5% from the
result obtained in V N −8 potential and by 1.5% from the
experiment.

this section we demonstrate that inclusion of the higher
than second-order core-valence correlations can lead to
further signiﬁcant improvements in accuracy of atomic
calculations. It is much easier to include higher-order cor-
relations in the V N −2 approximation than in any other
potential.

culations from Ba II. Table IV presents HF and Brueck-

ues. Brueckner energies are calculated with the second-
order correlation potential ˆΣ(2) and with the all-order
correlation potential ˆΣ(∞). The all-order ˆΣ(∞) includes
screening of Coulomb interaction and hole-particle inter-
action (see, e.g. [12]). Similar to what happens for alkali
atoms, inclusion of higher-order correlation corrections
for Ba II reduces the diﬀerence between theoretical and
experimental energies from 1 - 2% to 0.2 - 0.7%.

Now we are going to use the same correlation potential
ˆΣ1 for the neutral barium. The eﬀective Hamiltonian has
the form similar to (3)

ˆH eﬀ = ˆh1(r1) + h1(r2) + ˆh2(r1, r2).

(6)

One-electron part ˆh1 is given by Eq. (4), two-electron
part ˆh2 is given by Eq. (5). For the operator ˆΣ1 in (4) we
use second-order correlation potential ˆΣ(2) and all-order
correlation potential ˆΣ(∞), the same as for the Ba II ion.
We don’t include higher-order correlations in ˆΣ2 in
present work. Formally, perturbation expansion for both
ˆΣ-s goes over the same orders of MBPT. However, cal-
culations show that accurate treatment of ˆΣ1 is usually
more important. Since the aim of present work is to
demonstrate the advantages of the V N −M approximation
rather than presenting best possible calculations, neglect-
ing higher-order correlations in ˆΣ2, which has small eﬀect
on ﬁnal results, is justiﬁed.

Table V shows the results of calculations for few low
states of Ba I in the V N −2 approximation with ˆΣ(2) and
ˆΣ(∞) together with the experimental data. One can see
that inclusion of the higher-order core-valence correla-
tions do indeed improve signiﬁcantly the agreement be-
tween theoretical and experimental data.

It is interesting to note that there is strong correlation
between results for Ba I and Ba II. In both cases the least
accurate results are for states involving d-electrons. In-
clusion of higher-order core-valence correlations leads to
very similar improvement of results for Ba II and Ba I.
Also, if ˆΣ1 is rescaled to ﬁt the experimental energies
of Ba II, the agreement between theory and experiment
for Ba I would also be almost perfect. This feature can
be used to get very accurate results for negative ions.
Experimental results for negative ions are poor and ac-
curate calculations are diﬃcult. However, if we start cal-
culations from the V N −M approximation, include ˆΣ for
core-valence correlations, rescale ˆΣ1 to ﬁt known ener-
gies of a positive ion or neutral atom, the results for a

C. Atoms with more than two valence electrons.

We have demonstrated that V N −M approximation
work very well for atoms with two and eight valence elec-
trons. In is natural to expect that there are many similar
cases in between.

However, there is no reason to believe that this ap-
proximation works well for all atoms. There are many
cases were it doesn’t work at all. It depends mostly on
the distances where valence electrons are located rather
than on thier number. To check whether the V N −M ap-

5

proximation is a good approximation for a neutral atom
it is usually suﬃcient to perform Hartree Fock calcula-
tions for this atom and check that valence electrons are
localized on larger distances than core electrons. This is
usually the case if valence electrons are in s or p states.
In contrast, d and f valence electrons are localized on dis-
tances shorter than the distances of the uppermost core s
and p electrons. Their removal would lead to signiﬁcant
change in the atomic core which means that the V N −M
approximation is not good for these atoms.

Roughly speaking, the V N −M approximation should
work more or less well for about half of the periodic table.

III. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that the V N −M approximation
in which initial Hartree Fock procedure is done for and
ion with all valence electrons removed, is a good starting
point for accurate calculations for many-electron atoms
with s and/or p valence electrons. The main advantage
is relatively simple MBPT for core-valence correlations
which makes it easier to include higher-order core va-
lence correlations and thus improve the accuracy of the
calculations.

Considering examples of Kr and Ba we have demon-
strated that removal of as many as eight electrons from
initial HF potential does not compromise the accuracy of
the calculations for a neutral atom and that inclusion of
the higher-order core-valence correlations do really lead
to signiﬁcant improvements of the accuracy of the calcu-
lations.

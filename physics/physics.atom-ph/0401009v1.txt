Abstract

We consider a classical hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized electric ﬁeld of slow changing

frequency. When the system passes through a resonance between the driving frequency and the

Keplerian frequency of the electron’s motion, a capture into the resonance can occur. We study

this phenomenon in the case of 2:1 resonance and show that the capture results in growth of

the eccentricity of the electron’s orbit. The capture probability for various initial values of the

eccentricity is deﬁned and calculated.

INTRODUCTION

Dynamics of highly excited (Rydberg) atoms in microwave ﬁelds has been a subject of

extensive research during the last thirty years. After experiments of Bayﬁeld and Koch

[1] and theoretical work of Leopold and Percival [2], it was realised that certain essential

properties of the dynamics of Rydberg hydrogen atoms can be described in the frames of

classical approach.

One of the classical ideas in this area is to control the Keplerian motion of the electron

using its resonant interaction with a wave of slowly changing frequency. Dynamical problems

of this kind were studied in [3] for a 1-D model and [4] for a 3-D model. In particular, in

the latter work an hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized electric ﬁeld of slowly decreasing

frequency was considered. It was shown that at a passage through 2:1 resonance (i.e., when

the driving frequency is twice as large as the Keplerian frequency) the system with initially

zero eccentricity of the electron’s orbit is captured into the resonance.

In the captured

state, the electron’s Keplerian frequency varies in such a way that the resonant condition is

approximately satisﬁed. In this motion the orbit’s eccentricity grows, which may result in

ionization of the atom.

In the present work we also consider a 3-D hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized elec-

trostatic ﬁeld of slowly changing frequency. We study behaviour of the system near 2:1

resonance using methods of the theory of resonant phenomena, developed in [5] - [8] (see

also [9]). These methods were previously used in studies of various physical problems includ-

ing surfatron acceleration of charged particles in magnetic ﬁeld and electromagnetic wave

[10], slowly perturbed billiards [11], [12], and classical dynamics in a molecular hydrogen

ion [13]. In the present paper, we show that capture into the resonance necessarily occurs

not only in the case of zero initial eccentricity but also if the initial eccentricity is not zero

but small enough. Moreover, at larger values of the initial eccentricity the capture is also

possible. Following the general approach, capture into the resonance in this case can be

considered as a probabilistic phenomenon. We deﬁne and evaluate its probability. The ob-

tained results can be used to broaden the applicability of the resonant control methods for

Rydberg atoms.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we use standard techniques of classical

celestial mechanics and the theory of resonant phenomena to reduce the equations of motion

2

near the resonance to the standard form. We consider two diﬀerent cases: one of small

eccentricity and the other of eccentricity of order 1. In Section 3, we study the case of small

eccentricity. We apply relevant results of [5] and ﬁnd the region of so called ”automatic

capture” into the resonance at small eccentricities and calculate probability of capture at

larger values of initial eccentricity. Section 4 is devoted to the capture phenomenon at values

of eccentricity of order 1. We calculate the capture probability in this case too. In the both

cases, the capture signiﬁcantly changes the eccentricity of the electron’s orbit and may lead

to ionization. In Conclusions, we summarize the results.

EQUATIONS OF MOTION NEAR THE 2:1 RESONANCE

We study dynamics of a classical electron in a hydrogen atom perturbed by a harmonically

oscillating electric ﬁeld of small amplitude µ, linearly polarized along the Z-axis. This system

is described with Hamiltonian

H0 + Zµ cos Ψ.
H0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian of motion in the Coulomb ﬁeld and Ψ is the

Here

ω = ω(εt), 0 < ε

1, i.e. that this frequency slowly changes with time. For brevity, we

put the electron mass and charge to 1, and use dimensionless variables.

The unperturbed trajectory of the electron is an ellipse with eccentricity e, semimajor

axis a, and inclination i. It is a well-known fact from celestial mechanics that the so-called

Delaunay elements L, G, H, l, g, h provide a set of canonical variables for the system under

consideration (see, e.g. [14]). The Delaunay elements can be deﬁned as

l is the mean anomaly, g is the argument of the periapsis, and h is the longitude of the

In order to avoid possible singularities at e = 0, we make a canonical transformation of

As the perturbation frequency slowly varies with time, the system passes through res-
onances with the unperturbed Keplerian frequency ˙l. Near a resonance, certain terms in
H1 are changing very slowly. Consider a passage through the 2:1 reso-
nance. In this case, after averaging over fast oscillating terms, we obtain the Hamiltonian

Dynamics in the system with Hamiltonian function (18) was studied in details in [5]. In

this section we put forward the results of [5] relevant to our study.

of order ε−1.

This result is due to the fact that the area of G12 monotonously grows with time, and

conservation of the adiabatic invariant makes a phase point go deeper and deeper into this

region. A point captured in G12 rotates around point A= (xA, 0), where xA is the smallest

root of equation (22). As time grows,

also grows and point A on the portrait slowly

xA|

|

moves along x-axis in the negative direction. Therefore, the motion is a composition of

two components: fast rotation along a banana-shaped curve surrounding A and slow drift

along x-axis. The area surrounded by each banana-shaped turn is approximately the same

and equals the area

(λ∗) surrounded by the trajectory passing through (x(0), y(0)) at

S

λ = λ∗. Hence, the average distance between the phase point and the origin slowly grows,

corresponding to the eccentricity growth in the original problem.

In [4], it was shown that a point having zero initial eccentricity necessarily undergoes the

eccentricity growth. The formulated result implies that this is also valid for all the points

initially [i.e., at λ = λ∗] inside l1, except, maybe for a narrow strip close to l1. A typical

9

linear size of this domain is of order ˜µ1/3. In [15] this phenomenon was described and called

”automatic entry into libration”.

Consider now the case when the point (x(0), y(0)) is outside l1: ˜

F0 > 0. With time the
area inside l1 grows, and at a certain moment the phase trajectory crosses l1. In the adiabatic

approximation the area surrounded by the phase trajectory is constant:

(λ) =

(λ∗).

(λ∗). Here

Hence, in this approximation the time moment of crossing l1 can be found from equation
S1(λ) is the area inside l1 as a function of λ and Λ is a value of the
S1(Λ) =
parameter at this moment. After crossing, there are two possibilities: (i) the phase point
can continue its motion in G12 during a time interval of order at least ε−1 [this corresponds

S

to capture into the resonance and growth of the eccentricity]; (ii) without making a full turn

inside G12 the phase point can cross l2 and continue its motion in G2 [this corresponds to

passage through the resonance without capture]. The area of G2 also monotonously grows

with time, hence such a point can not cross l2 once more and return to G12

It is shown in [5] that the scenario of motion after crossing l1 strongly depends on ini-

tial conditions (x(0), y(0)): a small, of order ε, variation of initial conditions can result in

qualitatively diﬀerent evolution. If the initial conditions are deﬁned with a ﬁnal accuracy

δ, ε

δ

1, it is impossible to predict a priori the scenario of evolution. Therefore,

it is reasonable to consider capture into G12 or G2 as random events and introduce their

≪

probabilities.

Following [16], consider a circle of small radius δ with the centre at the initial point M0.

Then the probability of capture into G12 is deﬁned as

where Sδ

mation. The following formula for probability P is valid:

Geometrically, formula (24) can be interpreted as follows. In a Hamiltonian system, phase

volume is invariant. As parameter λ changes by ∆λ, a phase volume ∆V12 enters the region

G12. At the same time, a volume ∆V2 leaves this region and enters G2. The relative measure
of points captured in G12 is (∆V12 −
phase volume across l1, and I2 is the ﬂow across l2. Therefore,

∆V2)/∆V2. The integral I1 in (24) is the ﬂow of the

P

of points captured into G12.

Note that, rigorously speaking, there also exists a set of initial conditions that should

be excluded from consideration. Phase trajectories with initial conditions in this set pass

very close to saddle point C, and the asymptotic results of [5] cannot be applied to them.

However, this exclusive set is small: it is shown in [5] that its relative measure is a value of

order √ε.

In Figure 4a, capture into the resonance is shown. First, the phase point rotates around

the origin in region G1, then it crosses l1, enters region G12 and continues its motion in this

region. In the course of this motion, the average distance from the origin grows, correspond-

ing to the growth of the eccentricity. In Figure 4b, all the parameter values are the same

as in Figure 4a, but initial conditions are slightly diﬀerent. In this case, after crossing l1,

the phase point crosses l2 and gets into region G2. This is a passage through the resonance

without capture.

Summarizing the results of this section, we can say the following. (i) Capture into the

resonance in the considered case results in growth of the eccentricity of the electron’s orbit.

(ii) On the phase plane around the origin [e = 0], there exists a region of size of order ˜µ1/3

such that all phase trajectories with initial conditions [i.e. at λ = λ∗] in this region undergo

a capture into the resonance with necessity [”automatic capture”]. (iii) If initial eccentricity

is larger, and the initial point on the phase plane is out of the region mentioned above, there

is a ﬁnite probability that the phase trajectory will be captured into the resonance. This

probability is given by (24).

IV. CAPTURE INTO THE RESONANCE AT ECCENTRICITY OF ORDER 1.

If initial eccentricity is a value of order one, dynamics in a √µ-neighbourhood of the reso-

nance is described by Hamiltonian (19). In this Hamiltonian, Pr = Pr(τ ) is a monotonously

oscillation, and reverse rotation. The area S of the oscillatory domain is proportional to

P 2

r √µB; it can be shown that it is a monotonically growing function of Pr.

Now take into consideration the slow growth of Pr with time. This growth produces

slow motion of the phase portrait upwards on the phase cylinder. At the same time the

area between the separatrices slowly grows. As a result, phase point initially above the

upper separatrix, i.e.

in the domain of direct rotation, can cross the separatrix and be

either captured into the oscillatory domain (this is a capture into the resonance), or pass

through to the domain of reverse rotation. The ﬁnal mode of motion strongly depends on

initial conditions: a small, of order ε, variation in them can result in qualitatively diﬀerent

ﬁnal mode of motion. Thus, like in the situation described in Section 3, capture into the

12

oscillatory domain in this problem can be considered as a probabilistic phenomenon. The

probability of capture can be found as follows. As parameter Pr changes by a small value

For a captured phase point value of P remains at a distance of order √µ from Pr on

and at J < 0 it is always larger than √3/2. Note, however, that in the original system,

strictly speaking, the asymptotic methods used in this section are not applicable in the limit

point crosses the upper separatrix of the pendulum (19), and enters the oscillatory domain.

Since this moment, the phase trajectory does not encircle the phase cylinder and the average

value of P grows. The eccentricity also grows. Figure 5b shows a passage through the

resonance without capture. The phase point does not stay in the oscillatory domain, but

crosses the bottom separatrix and enters the domain of reverse rotation and continues its

only a small variation.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that if the frequency of the driving ﬁeld slowly decreases, there always ex-

ists a certain probability of capture into the resonance. A capture results in strong variation

of the electron orbit’s eccentricity, and may lead to ionisation of the atom. The resonant

capture mechanism is a good tool for control of behaviour of Rydberg atoms. Note, that even

if the capture probability is small (as in the case considered in Section 4), the phenomenon

is still important. Consider, for example, an ensemble of Rydberg atoms with various initial

eccentricities in the case when the driving frequency changes slowly periodically. Then, after

large enough number of these periods, a relative number of order one of the atoms undergo
the capture. If the capture probability is a value of order √µ, it will happen after Ø(µ−1/2)
periods, which needs time of order ε−1µ−1/2.

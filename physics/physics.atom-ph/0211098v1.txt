We report heteronuclear photoassociation spectroscopy in a mixture of magneto-optically trapped
6Li and 7Li. The laser-induced decrease in the 7Li steady-state particle number, only appearing
in the presence of 6Li, gives clear evidence of photoassociation to form 6Li7Li. Hyperﬁne resolved
spectra of the vibrational level v = 83 of the singlet state A1Σ+
u have been taken up to intensities of
1000 W/cm2. The absolute resonance frequencies and the rotational constant have been measured.
Saturation of the photoassociation rate has been observed for two hyperﬁne transitions, which can be
shown to be due to saturation of the rate coeﬃcient near the unitarity limit. Saturation intensities
on the order of 40 W/cm2 can be determined.

Photoassociation of cold atoms has been established as
a versatile tool for the formation of cold molecules. Start-
ing with atoms either from a magneto-optical trap or a
Bose-Einstein condensate this technique has been shown
to allow for eﬃcient production of various cold alkali
dimers [1, 2, 3, 4]. In single-photon photoassociation a
pair of free atoms is optically excited into a rovibrational
level of the electronically excited molecule. By sponta-
neous decay, either a pair of free atoms is formed, or,
with small fractional probability, a translationally cold
ground state molecule. In extension to this intrinsically
incoherent process, also coherent processes, such as two-
photon Raman-type transitions [4, 5, 6, 7], have been
investigated.
In the degenerate regime, such methods
should allow for coherent coupling between free atom-
pair states and speciﬁc molecular ground states, similar
to the recently observed atom-molecule coupling due to
a Feshbach resonance [8]. It is expected that quantum
statistics will aﬀect the initial atomic states as well as
the molecular product, leading to what may be phrased
as ‘superchemistry’ [9]. In this context, mixtures between
bosonic and fermionic gases are particularly interesting,
as they oﬀer not only the possibility of molecular Bose
gases, but also of molecular Fermi gases.

A promising candidate for such experiments is lithium.
It provides a stable fermionic and bosonic isotope,
it
can be routinely cooled to quantum degeneracy, and
mixtures between Bose- and Fermi-gases have already
been observed and studied [10, 11]. There is also ex-
tensive experience with photoassociation of homonuclear
lithium dimers in the nondegenerate and in the de-
generate regime [12, 13]. However, the formation of
fermionic molecules requires two atomic species with dif-

ferent quantum statistics.
clear photoassociation bears intrinsic diﬃculties [14] and,
although being very desirable as a universal tool [15],
it has not yet been implemented successfully in binary

mixtures. For studying heteronuclear photoassociation,
lithium is again exceptionally suitable. The isotopic shift
of only 10 GHz allows for resonant dipole-dipole interac-
tion in the excited molecular state already at large in-
ternuclear separations, which is a crucial prerequisite for
eﬃcient photoassociation [16].

Even though the theory of photoassociation at high
laser intensities is not yet fully understood [17, 18], it is
clear that for coherent coupling, optical excitation rates
are required that are fast as compared to the other rel-
evant time scales of the system (i.e. collision time and
decoherence time due to spontaneous decay of the in-
volved excited states). One indication for entering the
regime of suﬃciently strong excitation rates is the occur-
rence of saturation in the single-photon photoassociation
signal. Saturation studies have been reported for several
one-species experiments [19, 20]. However, a clear satu-
ration of the photoassociation rate has not been observed
yet.

In this paper we report on heteronuclear photoasso-
ciation in a mixture of magneto-optically trapped 6Li
and 7Li. We investigate photoassociation of 6Li7Li by
monitoring the 6Li-induced decrease in the 7Li steady-
state particle number as a function of the photoassoci-
ation laser frequency and intensity. The number of 6Li
atoms exceeds that of 7Li by a factor of 10 such that
the photoassociation losses are signiﬁcant only for 7Li
while the number of 6Li atoms remains almost unaﬀected.
This setup is possible only for heteronuclear photoassoci-
ation and substantially facilitates the quantitative anal-
ysis. Strong saturation of the photoassociation rate is
observed for two of four studied hyperﬁne lines of the
chosen singlet transition v = 83. We derive values for the
saturation intensities on the order of 40 W/cm2 which are
suﬃciently low to encourage future experiments aiming
at coherent control in the degenerate regime.

Our experimental setup has been described in detail
in [16]. The combined magneto-optical trap (MOT) is
operated with two independent diode-laser systems and

loaded from a single Zeeman-slowed atomic beam. The
particle numbers are monitored by two absorption lasers,
tuned into resonance of the respective cooling transition,
by means of a lock-in technique. The photoassociation
light is provided by a tunable dye laser, which is fo-
cused to a 1/e2 diameter of 300 µm, resulting in peak
intensities up to 1000 W/cm2. Its frequency is measured
with a combination of a commercial wavemeter, a Fabry-
Perot etalon and a doppler-free iodine ﬂuorescence spec-
troscopy [21]. If the laser light is resonant with a molecu-
lar transition, losses in the two-species MOT are induced
due to spontaneous decay of the excited molecule into a
pair of free atoms or a ground state molecule. To simplify
the quantitative analysis, we operate the MOTs such that
the particle number of the 6Li MOT is large compared to
that of the 7Li MOT. Therefore, losses in the 6Li particle
number due to heteronuclear photoassociation are small
and the 6Li MOT acts as a temporally constant back-
ground gas for the 7Li MOT. Moreover, quadratic losses
in the 7Li particle number are negligible. In that special
case the complicated solution of the coupled rate equa-
tions for a two-species system is reduced to the following
simple form for the 7Li steady-state particle number N 7:

N 7 =

L7
α7 + βPA

.

(1)

Here, L7 is the 7Li MOT loading rate, and α7 is the loss
rate mainly due to collisions with hot atoms from the
beam source. The photoassociation rate βPA = Kn6wr,
with the photoassociation rate coeﬃcient K, the 6Li peak
density n6, the factor w considering the relative atomic
hyperﬁne ground-state populations, and the factor r
accounting for the spatial overlap between the atomic
clouds and the laser beam. Spectra are taken by moni-
toring the 7Li steady-state atom number as a function of
the photoassociation laser frequency. With 1.25 MHz/s,
the scan rate was chosen slow as compared to the load-
ing time of the MOTs. The positions of the heteronu-
clear resonances can be predicted theoretically within
1 GHz, by applying the method of mass-reduced quan-
tum numbers [22] to the well-known data for homonu-
clear lithium [12]. To identify heteronuclear resonances
we have recorded the 7Li particle number with and with-
out the other isotope present. The additional resonances
give clear evidence of 6Li7Li photoassociation.

We have concentrated on the transition into the vi-
brational level v = 83 of the singlet series A1Σ+
u near a
detuning of 177 GHz to the red of the D1 line of 6Li. Its
outer turning point is placed at an internuclear separa-
tion of about 74 a0. At this detuning, the singlet series
of 6Li7Li is suﬃciently separated from the heteronuclear
triplet resonances as well as from the homonuclear 6Li6Li
and 7Li7Li transitions, while at the same time the pho-
toassociation rates are still large. A high-resolution pho-
toassociation spectrum for an intensity of 420 W/cm2 is
shown in Fig. 1. The four strongest lines ((a)-(d)) can be

assigned to transitions from the quartet of hyperﬁne en-
trance channels into the rotational level N = 1 of the ex-
cited state. This hyperﬁne structure reﬂects the diﬀerent
combinations of atomic hyperﬁne ground states (hyper-
ﬁne splitting: 228 MHz for 6Li and 804 MHz for 7Li) and
is a further clear indication of the heteronuclear struc-
ture of the molecule. The absolute transition frequency,
adjusted to the hyperﬁne center of gravity, amounts to
14897.4015(7) cm−1. Several lines to the excited-state
levels N = 0 (resonances (a’)-(d’)) and N = 2 (resonance
(a”)) are also visible. From more sensitive spectra taken
with a less focused laser beam (1.0 mm diameter), the ro-
tational constant B/h can be determined as 301(2) MHz.
The transitions into the N = 1 level can be assigned to s-
wave collisions and the transitions into the levels N = 0, 2
to p-wave collisions. The contributing partial waves are
determined in their parity by the selection rule on the
change of angular momentum and in their number by
the corresponding centrifugal barriers. For d-wave col-
lisions the barrier amounts to 38 mK at an internuclear
separation of 54 a0, which strongly suppresses contribu-
tions from d-waves and above, even as shape resonances.

In the following we discuss the intensity dependence
of the photoassociation rate. We took several series of
spectra up to intensities of 1000 W/cm2 and ﬁnd, that
the signal saturates. For all hyperﬁne transitions, we ob-
serve a remaining fraction of 7Li atoms, that cannot be
depleted, even in the limit of high laser intensities. Thus,
particle losses due to photoassociation must be limited at
high intensities. This limitation is to be explained by the
intensity dependence of the photoassociation rate. Inter-
nal MOT processes, such as optical pumping, thermal-
ization or diﬀusion, can be excluded as the origin of the

observed behaviour by a simple time scale argument. In
order to lead to a limited depletion, the losses due to pho-
toassociation must occur on the same time scale as the
loading time of the MOT, which is about 10 s. Internal
MOT processes happen on a much faster time scale and
therefore cannot limit the losses.

For a quantitative analysis, one has to take into ac-
count that the experimentally observed steady-state par-
ticle number N7 depends on the photoassociation rate in
a nonlinear way (see Eq. 1). We assume a Lorentzian fre-
quency dependence of the photoassociation rate βPA =
a/((f − fres)2 + γ2/4), with the central frequency fres,
the linewidth γ and a proportionality factor a. Inserting
this expression in equation 1 yields:

N 7 =

N7,0(1 − cf )
1 + a/(α7((f − fres)2 + γ2/4))

.

(2)

We account for slow drifts in the loading rate during
the frequency scan and for partial overlap of the dif-
ferent lines by assuming a linear frequency dependence
∝ (1 − cf ) of the steady-state particle number without
photoassociation laser present N7,0. For the atomic-beam
limited loss rate α7 we use the measured value of 0.11 s−1.
Up to intensities of 450 W/cm2 for transitions (a) and (b)
and of 600 W/cm2 for transitions (c) and (d) the diﬀerent
hyperﬁne lines do not show any signiﬁcant asymmetries
and partial overlap of the diﬀerent lines remains small,
so that the resulting quasi-Lorentzian function represents
the data suﬃciently well. This is exemplarily shown in
Fig. 2 for transition (a) at two intensities. Obviously,
asymmetries due to thermal averaging over the diﬀer-
ent collision energies [23] are negligible, since the natural
linewidth of the excited level (12 MHz, [24, 25]) plus the
unresolved hyperﬁne-structure of the excited state [26] is
larger than the thermal broadening of about 10 MHz for
the MOT temperature of 0.5 mK [27].

FIG. 3: Photoassociation rate as a function of the laser peak
intensity for the four diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions. The open
circles represent the uncorrected data.

For the determination of the photoassociation rate one
has to realize that the shape of the resonances can be
inﬂuenced by various systematic eﬀects. Due to the fo-
cussing of the photoassociation laser and due to inho-
mogenities in the beam proﬁle, the light shift [18] varies
spatially, which leads to inhomogeneous broadening. The
diﬀerent light shifts for the diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels of
the excited state contribute similarily. These broadening
mechanisms lead to asymmetries at very high intensities
and ﬂatten the approximately Lorentzian lines at moder-
ate laser intensities. However, the area of the frequency-
integrated photoassociation rate is preserved, which has
been checked numerically. Therefore, we correct the max-
imum photoassociation rate 4a/γ2, which we get from
the ﬁt, by multiplying with the ratio of the broadened
linewidth γ and the linewidth in the limit for zero in-
tensity, γI=0, which gives βPA,0 = 4a/γγI=0 [28]. This
corrected photoassociation rate βPA,0 is proportional to
the area of the rate and corresponds to the maximum rate
in absence of any broadening mechanisms, both broaden-
ing due to systematic eﬀects and power broadening due
to saturation. Extrapolation of the broadened linewidths
towards zero intensity leads to values for γI=0 of 51, 45,
33, 40 MHz for resonances (a)-(d) respectively. They in-
clude the natural linewidth, the unresolved structure of
the diﬀerent involved excited hyperﬁne states and ther-
mal broadening. In Fig. 3 the photoassociation rate for
the four diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions is presented as a
function of the laser intensity. The data points are mean

values of up to 4 spectra. The error bars indicate the
statistical error. While the rates for the transitions (c)
and (d) do not saturate in the given intensity range (the
uncorrected rates 4a/γ2, which seem to saturate are also
indicated), strong saturation is observed for the transi-
tions (a) and (b). As the 6Li density is nearly unaﬀected
by the photoassociation, this saturation must be due to
saturation of the rate coeﬃcient K.

For the interpretation we use a simpliﬁed model ac-
cording to the close-coupled theory of Bohn and Juli-
It yields an analytic expression for the rate
enne [18].
coeﬃcient for a two-level system and a speciﬁc scatter-
ing energy. To compare with the experimental corrected
photoassociation rate, we have to adapt the theoretical
expression by multiplying with the ratio of the power-
broadened linewidth and the natural linewidth. For s-
wave collisions this leads to the following intensity depen-
dence for the corrected photoassociation rate coeﬃcient:

K0 =

πv
k2

4
1 + Isat/I

(3)

where v is the velocity and k is the wave number of the
relative motion. Isat is the energy-dependent saturation
intensity, for which the natural linewidth equals the in-
duced linewidth. This intensity dependence also applies
for the thermally-averaged corrected rate coeﬃcient with
approximately the same saturation intensity, as checked
by simulations. A full theoretical analysis would include
a population-weighted summation over the diﬀerent tran-
sitions from the magnetic ground-state sublevels to the
various excited hyperﬁne states and has not been carried
out yet. We thus assume the validity of the expression
(Eq. 3) also for the full problem, and use it for a ﬁt to the
data of the saturating transitions. For the saturation in-
tensities we obtain values of 28 W/cm2 for transition (a)
and of 54 W/cm2 for transition (b). This is about 104
times the atomic saturation intensity and in good agree-
ment with an estimation for a two-level system, which
gives 33 W/cm2 for an energy of E/kB = 0.5 mK [29].
For the corrected photoassociation rates, we receive max-
imum values of 0.06 s−1 for resonance (a) and 0.14 s−1
for resonance (b). Taking into account an estimated 6Li
peak intensity of 1010 cm−3, the overlap factor r = 0.22,
the population factor w (0.42 and 0.21 for the transitions
(a) and (b) respectively, statistical distribution assumed),
and the correction factor of 4 (see Eq. 3), the saturated
photoassociation rate coeﬃcient K can be estimated to
be (2·10−11 − 8·10−11) cm3s−1. This value is close to the
unitarity limit, where the scattering probability |S|2 →
1. In this limit the rate coeﬃcient is simply given by the
product of the scattering cross-section π/k2 and the ve-
locity v, resulting in 5·10−10 cm3s−1 for the temperature
considered. For a more sophisticated analysis, knowl-
edge of the diﬀerent ground-state sublevel populations,
of the various Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients and of laser-
polarization eﬀects would be required.

In summary, we have observed heteronuclear photoas-
sociation in 6Li7Li. Studying the intensity dependence
of the hyperﬁne resolved singlet spectrum, we have ob-
served saturation of the rate coeﬃcients for two of the
four hyperﬁne lines and determined the corresponding
saturation intensities. The observation of the unitarity
limit has been possible, as it is orders of magnitude lower
at MOT temperatures than at temperatures in the de-
generate regime [20]. Reaching the unitarity limit is an-
other proof that already at MOT temperatures quantum
mechanical properties become apparent.

We demonstrate how to separate the rotational degrees of freedom in

a quantum N -body problem completely from the internal ones. It is shown

that any common eigenfunction of the total orbital angular momentum (ℓ)

and the parity in the system can be expanded with respect to (2ℓ + 1)

base-functions, where the coeﬃcients are the functions of the internal vari-

ables. We establish explicitly the equations for those functions, called the

generalized radial equations, which are (2ℓ + 1) coupled partial diﬀerential

equations containing only (3N − 6) internal variables.

Symmetry is an important property of a physical system. The symmetry of a quantum

system can simplify its Schr¨odinger equation and remove some variables in the equation.

The simplest example is the hydrogen atom problem, where, due to the spherical sym-

metry, the wavefunction is expressed as a product of a radial function and a spherical

harmonic function,

Ψℓ

m(r) = φ(r)Y ℓ

m(θ, ϕ),

(1)

and the Schr¨odinger equation reduces to a radial equation with only one radial variable.

For a quantum N-body problem with a pair potential, the Schr¨odinger equation is in-

variant under the spatial translation, rotation, and inversion. From those symmetries,

one should be able to separate the motion of center-of-mass and the global rotation of

the system from the internal motions so as to reduce the Schr¨odinger equation to the

generalized ”radial” equation that contains only internal variables. However, this prob-

lem has not been solved. In this letter we will solve this problem completely. Using the

appropriately chosen (3N − 6) internal variables and the (2ℓ + 1) base-functions for the

total orbital angular momentum ℓ, we establish explicitly the generalized radial equations

without any approximation. Only (3N − 6) internal variables are involved in both the

generalized radial functions and the equations.

Denote by rj the position vectors of N-particles with masses mj in the laboratory

frame (LF), respectively. The Schr¨odinger equation for the N-body problem is

(2)

where V is assumed to be a pair potential, depending on the distances of each pair of

particles. Therefore, the potential V is a function of only the internal variables. It is well

known that, due to the translation symmetry of the system, the motion of center-of-mass

can be separated completely from others by making use of the Jacobi coordinate vectors

in the center-of-mass frame (CF) [1-3],

(4)

The Laplace operator obviously has the symmetry of O(3N − 3) group with respect to

(3N − 3) variables. The O(3N − 3) group contains a subgroup SO(3) × O(N − 1), where

SO(3) is the usual rotational group. The space inversion and the diﬀerent deﬁnitions

for the Jacobi vectors in the so-called ”Jacobi tree” [4] can be obtained by O(N − 1)

transformations. For the system of identical particles, the permutation group among

particles is also a subgroup of O(N − 1) group.

Because of the spherical symmetry, the angular momentum is conserved. The hydrogen

atom problem is a typical quantum two-body problem, where there is only one Jacobi

coordinate vector, usually called the relative position vector r. For a quantum N-body

problem, equation (1) should be generalized in three aspects. The ﬁrst is how to deﬁne

the internal variables, which describe the internal motions completely. The second is

2

how to ﬁnd the complete set of the independent base-functions with the given angular

momentum. The total wavefunction is expanded with respect to the base-functions, where

the coeﬃcients are the generalized radial functions which only depend on the internal

variables. The last is how to derive the generalized radial equations that only contain

(3N − 6) internal variables. As a matter of fact, these three aspects are connected. The

parity should also be considered in the generalization. Due to the spherical symmetry, one

only needs to study the eigenfunctions of angular momentum with the largest eigenvalue

of L3 (m = ℓ), which are simply called the wavefunctions with the angular momentum

ℓ in this letter for simplicity. Their partners with the smaller eigenvalues of L3 can be

calculated from them by the lowering operator L−.

Denote by R = R(α, β, γ) a spatial rotation, transforming CF to the body-ﬁxed frame

(BF), and by ξ all the internal variables in a quantum N-body problem for simplicity.

Although Wigner did not separate the motion of center-of-mass by the Jacobi vectors, he

proved from the group theory that any wavefunction with the angular momentum ℓ in

the system can be expressed as follows (see Eq. (19.6) in [5]):

Ψℓ

ℓ(α, β, γ, ξ) =

ℓ

Xq=−ℓ

Dℓ

ℓq(α, β, γ)∗ψq(ξ),

(5)

where we adopt the commonly used form of the D-function [6]. In Eq. (5) Dℓ

ℓq(α, β, γ)∗

plays the role of the base-function with the angular momentum ℓ, and ψq(ξ) is the gener-

alized radial function. What Wigner proved is that there are only (2ℓ + 1) independent

base-functions with the angular momentum ℓ. Unfortunately, due to the singularity of

the Euler angles, the generalized radial equations are very diﬃcult to derive based on

Eq. (5). Wigner did not discuss the generalized radial equations, and to our knowledge,

those equations have not yet been established in the literature.

It is obvious that the

generalized radial equations are very easy to obtain for the S wave [7]. However, it seems

quite diﬃcult to obtain even for P wave in a three-body problem [8,9].

Recently, a coupled angular momentum basis was used to prediagonalize the kinetic

energy operator [10], where some oﬀ-diagonal elements remain non-vanishing. In their

calculation, the function with a given angular momentum was combined from the partial

angular momentum states by the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients. Since the partial angular

momenta are not conserved, one has to deal with, in principle, an inﬁnite number of

3

the partial angular momentum states. This problem also occurs in the hyperspherical

harmonic function method and its improved ones [2,4,11,12]. However, as Wigner proved,

only (2ℓ + 1) partial angular momentum states are involved in constructing the base-

functions with the angular momentum ℓ.

Arbitrarily choose two Jacobi coordinate vectors, say R1 and R2. Let R1 be parallel

with the Z-axis of BF, and R2 be located in the XZ plane with a non-negative X-

component in BF. The rotational degrees of freedom of the system are described by a

rotation R(α, β, γ), transforming CF to BF. Deﬁne (3N − 6) internal variables, which

should be invariant in the global rotation R(α, β, γ):

ξj = Rj · R1,

ηj = Rj · R2,

ζj = Rj · (R1 ∧ R2) ,

1 ≤ j ≤ (N − 1),

(6)

where η1 = ξ2 and ζ1 = ζ2 = 0. It is worth mentioning that ξj and ηj have even parity,

but ζj has odd parity. From them we have

Ωj = (R1 ∧ Rj) · (R1 ∧ R2) = ξ1ηj − ξ2ξj,

ωj = (R2 ∧ Rj) · (R1 ∧ R2) = ξ2ηj − η2ξj,

Rj · Rk = Ω−1

2 (Ωjηk − ωjξk + ζjζk) ,

(7)

where Ω1 = ω2 = 0, and Ω2 = −ω1 = (R1 ∧ R2)2.

Recall that two Jacobi vectors R1 and R2 completely determine BF and three Euler

angles. The base-functions with the angular momentum ℓ should be combined from the

products of two spherical harmonic functions Y q

m(R1) and Y p

m′(R2) by the Clebsch-Gordan

coeﬃcients hq, m, p, m′|ℓ, (m + m′)i. Deﬁne [3,11]

Theorem. Any function Ψℓλ

ℓ (R1, · · · , RN −1) with the angular momentum ℓ and the parity

(−1)ℓ+λ in a quantum N-body problem can be expanded with respect to Qℓτ

q (R1, R2) with

the coeﬃcients ψℓλ

where the parity of ψℓλ

qτ (ξ, η, ζ) is (−1)λ−τ .

Equation (5) coincides with Eq. (10), because either of the set of Dℓ

ℓq(α, β, γ)∗ and the

set of Qℓτ

q (R1, R2) is a complete set of base-functions of the angular momentum. However,

equation (10) has three important characteristics, which make it possible to derive the

generalized radial equations. The ﬁrst is that the Euler angles do not appear explicitly

in the base-functions Qℓτ

q (R1, R2). The second is the well chosen internal variables (6).

The third is that the internal variables ζj have odd parity.

It is due to the existence

of ζj that the base-functions Qℓ0

q (R1, R2) and Qℓ1

q (R1, R2) appear together in one total

wavefunction. By comparison, all the internal variables in a quantum three-body problem

have even parity (ζj = 0) so that in a total wavefunction with a given parity, only the

base-functions with the same parity appear [5,12].

Now, substituting Eq. (10) into the Schr¨odinger equation (2) with the Laplace operator

(4), we obtain the generalized radial equations by a straightforward calculation:

Due to the limited size of a letter, we have to leave the proof of the theorem and the

detailed calculation elsewhere. When establishing BF we arbitrarily choose two Jacobi

coordinate vectors R1 and R2. Those two vectors may be replaced with any other two

Jacobi vectors. One may change the choice according to the characteristics of the physical

problem under study, such as some or all particles in the quantum N-body problem are

the identical particles.

In deriving the generalized radial equations, the key is to discover the base-functions

Qℓτ

q (R1, R2) of the angular momentum and to choose the right internal variables, some

of which have odd parity. From Eq. (9) we see that only ﬁnite number of partial angular

momentum states are involved in constructing the base-functions Qℓτ

q (R1, R2). Namely,

the contributions from the remaining partial angular momentum states have been incor-

porated into those from the generalized radial functions.

The two features in this method, that the numbers of both functions ψℓλ

qτ (ξ, η, ζ) and

equations are ﬁnite, and they depend only on (3N −6) internal variables, are important for

calculating the energy levels and wavefunctions in a quantum N-body problem. In fact,

in the numerical experiment for the quantum three-body problem by the series expansion,

much fewer terms have to be taken to achieve the same precision of energy than with other

methods. The calculation error will be less in comparison with the method to truncate

the series on the partial angular momentum states. As the number of the particles in the

6

system increases, we believe, to remove three independent variables will greatly decrease

the calculation capacity requirement.

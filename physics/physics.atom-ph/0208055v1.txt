Relativistic many-body calculations of transition rates from core-excited states in
sodiumlike ions

Rates and line strengths are calculated for the 2s22p53l3l′ - 2s22p63l′′ and 2s2p63l3l′ - 2s22p63l′′
electric-dipole (E1) transitions in Na-like ions with nuclear charges ranging from Z = 14 to 100.
Relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT), including the Breit interaction, is used to
evaluate retarded E1 matrix elements in length and velocity forms. The calculations start from
a 1s22s22p6 Dirac-Fock potential. First-order RMBPT is used to obtain intermediate coupling
coeﬃcients and second-order RMBPT is used to calculate transition matrix elements. A detailed
discussion of the various contributions to dipole matrix elements is given for sodiumlike copper (Z =
29). Transition energies used in the calculation of transition rates are from second-order RMBPT.
Trends of transition rates as functions of Z are shown graphically for selected transitions.

INTRODUCTION

Transitions from 2s22p53l3l′ and 2s2p63l3l′ states to
the ground (2s22p63s) or singly-excited (2s22p63p and
2s22p63d) states form satellite lines to the bright electric-
dipole (E1) lines created by transitions from 2s22p53l
and 2s2p63l states to the ground state (2s22p6) in Ne-
like ions. These core-excited 2s22p53l3l′ and 2s2p63l3l′
states (often called doubly-excited states) in sodiumlike
ions have been studied extensively both experimentally
and theoretically over the past 20-30 years.

Transition rates and oscillator strengths for Na-like
ions have been calculated using multi-conﬁguration
Dirac-Fock (MCDF)
[1, 2] and multi-conﬁguration
Hartree-Fock (MCHF) [3, 4, 5] methods. Recently, R-
matrix calculations of electron-impact collision strengths
for excitations from the inner L-shell into doubly excited
states of Fe15+ was presented by Bautista [6]. Energies
of 2s22p63l and 2s22p53l3l′ states were calculated in that
paper using the SUPERSTRUCTURE code [7]. It was
shown in [6] that disagreement between calculated data
and data recommended by Sugar and Corliss [8] and Shi-
rai et al. [9] ranges from 0.5% to 5%.

Experimentally,

core-excited 2s22p53l3l′ and
2s2p63l3l′ states were studied by the beam-foil technique
[10, 11], photo-emission [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21], and Auger spectroscopy [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Strong

like ions together with satellite lines of Na-like ions were
observed from laser-produced plasmas [12, 13, 14, 15, 16],
X-pinch, [17], tokamaks [18, 19], EBIT [20], and solar
ﬂares [21]. The identiﬁcation of measured spectral lines
was based on theoretical calculations carried out primar-
ily using the MCDF method with Cowan’s code [27].

In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of cal-
culations for 2s22p53l3l′ - 2s22p63l′′ and 2s2p63l3l′ -
2s22p63l′′ transitions to compare with previous calcula-
tions and experiments. Our aim is to provide benchmark
values for the entire Na isoelectronic sequence. The large
number of possible transitions have made experimental
identiﬁcation diﬃcult. Experimental veriﬁcations should
become simpler and more reliable using this more accu-
rate set of calculations.

is used here to determine matrix ele-
(RMBPT)
ments and transition rates for allowed and forbidden
electric-dipole transitions between the odd-parity core-
excited states (2s22p53s2 + 2s22p53p2 + 2s22p53d2 +
2s22p53s3d + 2s2p63s3p + 2s2p63p3d) and the ground
state (2s22p63s) together with the two singly-excited
states (2s22p63d) and the even-parity core-excited states
(2s22p53s3p + 2s22p53p3d + 2s2p63s2 + 2s2p63p2 +
2s2p63d2 + 2s2p63s3d) and the two singly-excited states
(2s22p63p) in Na-like ions with nuclear charges ranging
from Z = 14 to 100. Retarded E1 matrix elements are
evaluated in both length and velocity forms. These
calculations start from a Ne-like core Dirac-Fock (DF)
potential. First-order perturbation theory is used to ob-
tain intermediate coupling coeﬃcients and second-order
RMBPT is used to determine transition matrix elements.
The energies used in the calculation of transition rates
are obtained from second-order RMBPT.

II. METHOD

In this section, we discuss relativistic RMBPT for ﬁrst-
and second-order transition matrix elements for atomic
systems with two valence electrons and one hole. Details
of the RMBPT method for calculation of radiative tran-
sition rates for systems with one valence electron and
one hole were presented for Ne-like and Ni-like ions in
[28, 29]. Here, we follow the pattern of the correspond-
ing calculation in Refs. [28, 29] but limit our discussion to
the model space and the ﬁrst- and second-order particle-
particle-hole diagram contributions in Na-like ions.

The uncoupled reduced matrix elements are calculated
in both length and velocity gauges. Diﬀerences between
length and velocity forms are illustrated for the uncou-
pled [3s3d5/2[2]2p3/2 (1/2) - 3s] matrix element in panels
(a) and (b) of Fig. 1. In the high-Z limit, Z (1) is propor-
tional to 1/Z, Z (2) is proportional to 1/Z 2, and B(2) is
independent of Z (see [31]). Taking into account this Z-
dependence, we plot Z (1)
104 in
the ﬁgure. The contribution of the second-order matrix
elements Z (2) is seen to be much larger in length form.
Diﬀerences between results in length and velocity forms
shown in Fig. 1 are precisely compensated by “derivative
terms” P (derv), as shown later.

For Na-like ions with two electrons above the Ne-like

model space is formed from particle-particle-hole states

Indices v and w designate valence electrons and
a designates a core electron. For our study of low-lying
3l3l′2l−1 states of Na-like ions, the index a ranges over
2s, 2p1/2, and 2p3/2, while v and w range over 3s, 3p1/2,
3p3/2, 3d3/2, and 3d5/2. To obtain orthonormal model
states, we consider the coupled states (vwa) deﬁned by

B. Dipole matrix element

C. Dipole matrix elements in Cu18+

In Table I, we list values of uncoupled ﬁrst- and second-
order dipole matrix elements Z (1), Z (2), B(2), together
with derivative terms P (derv) for Na-like copper, Z = 29.
For simplicity, we only list values for selected dipole tran-
sitions between odd-parity states with J = 1/2 and the
ground 3s and excited 3d3/2 states. Uncoupled matrix
elements for other transitions in Na-like copper are given
in Table II of the accompanying EPAPS document [30].
The derivative terms shown in Table I arise because tran-
sition amplitudes depend on energy, and the transition
energy changes order-by-order in RMBPT calculations.
Both length (L) and velocity (V ) forms are given for the
matrix elements. We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst-order matrix ele-
ments Z (1)
V diﬀer by 10%; the L - V diﬀerences
between second-order matrix elements are much larger
for some transitions. The term P (derv) in length form
almost equals Z (1) in length form but P (derv) in velocity
form is smaller than Z (1) in velocity form by three to four
orders of magnitude.

L and Z (1)

Although we use an intermediate-coupling scheme, it
is nevertheless convenient to label the physical states us-
ing the LS scheme. Length and velocity forms of cou-
pled matrix elements diﬀer only in the fourth or ﬁfth
digits. These L - V diﬀerences arise because we start
our RMBPT calculations using a non-local Dirac-Fock
potential. If we were to replace the DF potential by a lo-
cal potential, the diﬀerences would disappear completely.
Removing the second-order contribution increases L - V
diﬀerences by a factor of 10. Values of coupled reduced
matrix elements in length and velocity forms are given
in Table III of the accompanying EPAPS document [30].
Theoretical wavelengths λ and transition probabilities Ar
for selected transitions in Na-like from Z = 26 up to Z
= 30 are given in Table IV of [30].

The ﬁrst- and second-order reduced E1 matrix ele-
ments Z (1), and Z (2), and the second-order Breit correc-
tion to the reduced E1 matrix element B(2) for a tran-
sition between the uncoupled particle-particle-hole state
Ψ(QJM ) of Eq. (1) and the one-particle state a†

1/2 to two possible singly-excited odd-parity states are
presented in Fig. 2. Figures for transitions from other
states are found in the accompanying EPAPS document
[30].

We ﬁnd that transitions with smooth Z-dependence
are rarer than transitions with sharp features. Smooth
Z-dependence occurs for transitions from doublet and
quartet core-excited states. Usually, singularities occur
in the intermediate interval of Z = 25 - 50 when neither
LS nor jj coupling schemes describe the states of these
ions properly. One general conclusion that can be derived
from the ﬁgures is that the smooth Z-dependence oc-
curs more frequently for transitions from low-lying core-
excited states.

Singularities in the transition-rate curves have two
distinct origins: avoided level crossings and zeros in
dipole matrix elements. Avoided level crossings result
in changes of the dominant conﬁguration of a state at a
particular value of Z and lead to abrupt changes in the
transition rate curves when the partial rates associated
with the dominant conﬁgurations below and above the

5

crossing point are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Zeros in tran-
sition matrix elements lead to cusp-like minima in the
transition rate curves. Examples of each of these two
singularity types can be seen in Fig. 2.

In Table II, we present data for transitions from odd-
parity states with J = 1/2 in Fe+15 and Xe+43. We
compare the present RMBPT values with those given
by Nilsen [2]. More complete comparisons are given in
the accompanying EPAPS document [30]. The calcula-
tions of [2] were based on a multiconﬁgurational rela-
tivistic bound-state and distorted-wave continuum code
(YODA). Since jj labeling was used in [2], we keep that
labeling in Table II. We ﬁnd that the Ar-values from
RMBPT and YODA diﬀer by 10% in most cases. The
diﬀerences are explained by the second-order corrections
to dipole matrix elements included in RMBPT.

In Tables III - V, wavelengths and electric-dipole tran-
sition rates are presented for transitions in Na-like Fe,
Co, Ni, Cu and Zn. We limit the tables to transitions
given in Refs. [12, 14, 20]. Measurements for Fe15+ are
presented in Tables III and IV since two diﬀerent ranges
of spectra were investigated in Ref. [12] (16.8 - 17.8 ˚A)
and Ref. [14] (15.1 - 15.5 ˚A). Three lines for Fe15+ were
identiﬁed in region (15.1 - 15.26 ˚A) by Brown et al.
in
Ref. [20]. All possible 3l1j13l2j2[J1]2l3j3(J) - 3lj transi-
tions produce 393 spectrum lines. These lines in Fe15+
are covered by four spectral regions; 12.5 - 14.2 ˚A (114
lines), 15.1 - 15.9 ˚A (174 lines), 16.8 - 17.9 ˚A (102 lines),
and 19.3 - 19.7 ˚A (3 lines). The ﬁrst 114 lines are from
3dj13dj2[J1]2s(J) - 3lj and 3pj13dj2[J1]2s1/2(J) - 3lj
transitions and the last three lines are from 3s3s[0]2pj(J)
- 3dj transitions. Our RMBPT data together with exper-
imental measurements for Fe15+ in the region of 16.8 -
17.8 ˚A and 15.1 - 15.5 ˚A are presented in Tables III and
IV, respectively. The agreement between our RMBPT
wavelengths and the experimental values is 0.02 - 0.04%
for both regions of the spectrum.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have presented a systematic second-order relativis-
tic MBPT study of reduced matrix elements and transi-
tion rates for [3l1j13l2j2[J1]2l3j3 (J) - 3lj] electric-dipole
transitions in sodiumlike ions with the nuclear charges
Z ranging from 14 to 100. Our retarded E1 matrix ele-
ments include correlation corrections from Coulomb and
Breit interactions. Both length and velocity forms of
the matrix elements were evaluated and small diﬀerences
(0.4% - 1%), caused by the non locality of the start-
ing DF potential, were found between the two forms.
Second-order RMBPT transition energies were used in
our evaluation of transition rates. These calculations
were compared with other calculations and with avail-
20, we believe that the
able experimental data. For Z
present theoretical data are more accurate than other
theoretical or experimental data for transitions between
the 3l1j13l2j2[J1]2l3j3 (J) core-excited states and the 3lj

In the above equations, the index b designates core states, index n designates excited states, and index i denotes
an arbitrary core or excited state. In the sums over i in Eqs. (A3,A4), all terms with vanishing denominators are
excluded. The deﬁnitions of Xk(abcd) and Zk(abcd) are given by Eq.(2.12) and Eq.(2.15) in Ref. [32] and ∆ij is
deﬁned at the end of section II in [32]; ǫ(w) is a one-electron DF energy.

The derivative term is just the derivative of the the ﬁrst-order matrix element with respect to the transition energy.
It is introduced to account for the ﬁrst-order change in transition energy. An auxiliary quantity P (derv) is deﬁned by

P (derv)(v0w0 [J12] aJ, xJ ′) =

Here, ǫ(vwa) = ǫ(v) + ǫ(w)

ǫ(a), Z (1+2) = Z (1) + Z (RPA) + Z (corr). (Note that Z (HF) vanishes since we start from
a Hartree-Fock basis.) The sum over vwa, J ′
12 is understood as sum over the complex of states with the same J and
parity. In Eq. (A6), we let B(2) = B(RPA) + B(HF) +B(corr) to represent second-order corrections arising from the
Breit interaction. The quantities CF
12]a(J)] are eigenvectors (or mixing coeﬃcients) for particle-particle-hole
state F . The initial state I is a single, one-valence state. Using the above formulas and the results for uncoupled
reduced matrix elements, we carry out the transformation from uncoupled reduced matrix elements to intermediate
coupled matrix elements between physical states.

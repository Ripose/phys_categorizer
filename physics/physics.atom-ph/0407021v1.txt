Narrow line laser cooling is advancing the frontier for experiments ranging from studies of fun-
damental atomic physics to high precision optical frequency standards. In this paper, we present
an extensive description of the systems and techniques necessary to realize 689 nm 1S0 - 3P1 nar-
row line cooling of atomic 88Sr. Narrow line cooling and trapping dynamics are also studied in
detail. By controlling the relative size of the power broadened transition linewidth and the single-
photon recoil frequency shift, we show that it is possible to continuously bridge the gap between
semiclassical and quantum mechanical cooling. Novel semiclassical cooling process, some of which
are intimately linked to gravity, are also explored. Moreover, for laser frequencies tuned above the
atomic resonance, we demonstrate momentum-space crystals containing up to 26 well deﬁned lattice
points. Gravitationally assisted cooling is also achieved with blue-detuned light. Theoretically, we
ﬁnd the blue detuned dynamics are universal to Doppler limited systems. This paper oﬀers the most
comprehensive study of narrow line laser cooling to date.

INTRODUCTION

Narrow line magneto-optical traps (MOTs) are rapidly
becoming powerful tools in a diverse array of experimen-
tal studies. These unique and versatile systems have,
for example, already been used as integral components
in obtaining fully maximized MOT phase-space densi-
ties [1], nuclear-spin based sub-Doppler cooling [2, 3],
all-optical quantum degenerate gases [4], and recoil-free
spectroscopy of both dipole allowed [5] and doubly-
forbidden [6] optical transitions. In the future, narrow
line MOTs promise to revolutionize the next generation
of high precision optical frequency standards [7, 8, 9].
Narrow line cooling, via the relative size of the transi-
tion natural width Γ and the single-photon recoil fre-
quency shift ωR, also displays a unique set of thermal-
mechanical laser cooling dynamics. In a previous paper
[10], we explored these behaviors by cooling 88Sr on the
1S0 - 3P1 intercombination transition.
In the present
work, we signiﬁcantly expand upon this discussion and
provide a comprehensive description of the experimental
techniques used to realize and study 1S0 - 3P1 cooling
and trapping.

Fully understanding narrow line laser cooling requires
ﬁrst clarifying the diﬀerence between broad and narrow
Doppler cooling lines. Broad lines, historically used for
nearly every laser cooling experiment [11], are deﬁned by
Γ/ωR >> 1. The 461 nm 88Sr 1S0 - 1P1 transition shown
in Fig. 1(a), which typiﬁes a broad line, has, for exam-
103. In this case, Γ, or more generally
ple, Γ/ωR
the power-broadened linewidth ΓE, is the natural energy
scale. Here, ΓE = Γ√1 + s is deﬁned by the saturation
parameter s = I/IS where I (IS) is the single-beam peak
intensity (transition saturation intensity). Semiclassical
physics thus governs the cooling process and the photon
recoil, although essential to quantitatively understanding
energy dissipation [13], serves more as a useful conceptual
tool than a dominant player in system dynamics. More-
over, gravity is essentially negligible since the ratio of the
maximum radiative force to the gravitational force, R =

~kΓ/2mg, is typically on the order of 105, where 2π~, k,
m, and g are Plank’s constant, the light ﬁeld wavevec-
tor, the atomic mass, and the gravitational acceleration,
respectively.

In contrast, narrow Doppler cooling lines are character-
1. The 689 nm 88Sr 1S0 - 3P1 transition
ized by Γ/ωR
used in this work, for example, has Γ/ωR = 1.6 where
Γ/2π (ωR/2π = ~k2/4πm) is 7.5 kHz (4.7 kHz). In this
case, the relevant thermal-mechanical energy scale and
thus the underlying semiclassical or quantum mechani-
cal nature of the cooling depends on s. Details of a given
cooling process are then set by the laser detuning 2πδ =
∆ = ωL
ωA where ωL (ωA) is the laser (atomic reso-
nance) frequency. In particular, δ < 0 1S0 - 3P1 MOT
dynamics can be divided into three qualitatively distinct
regimes, hereafter labeled (I - III), deﬁned by the relative
size of
ωR, and ΓE. In regime (III), correspond-

ing to trapping beam intensities on the order of IS =
3µW/cm2 or s
1, ωR is the natural energy scale. Here,
single photon recoils and consequently, quantum physics,
govern trap dynamics. This situation enables limiting
temperatures of roughly half the photon recoil limit (TR
= 2~ωR/kB = 460 nK, where kB is Boltzmann’s con-
stant) despite the incoherent excitation provided by the
trapping beams [11, 14].

∼

≫

Conversely, for s

1 the system evolves toward semi-
classical physics where ΓE
ωR and hence ΓE is the
≫
dominant energy scale. In this case, cooling and motional
dynamics are determined by the relative size of ΓE and
∆. In regime (II), the ∆ < ΓE radiative force produces
damped harmonic motion and, in analogy to standard
Doppler cooling, MOT thermodynamics set entirely by
the velocity dependence of the force [12, 15]. For these
conditions, the expected δ- and s-dependent tempera-
ture minima are observed, although with values globally
smaller than standard Doppler theory predictions. Al-
ternatively, in regime (I) where ∆ > ΓE, the atom-light
interaction is dominated by single-beam photon scatter-
ing and trap thermodynamics become intimately linked
to both the velocity and the spatial dependence of the

force. Here, gravity plays an essential role as the ra-
tio R for the 1S0 - 3P1 transition is only
16. Con-
sequently, the atoms sag to vertical positions where the
Zeeman shift balances δ, leading to δ-independent equi-
librium temperatures.

∼

Narrow line cooling also displays a unique set of δ >
0 thermal and mechanical dynamics. For these experi-
ments, the atomic gas is ﬁrst cooled to µK temperatures
and then δ is suddenly switched from δ < 0 to δ > 0. Sub-
sequently, the sample evolves from a thermal distribution
to a discrete set of momentum-space packets whose align-
ment matches lattice points on a three-dimensional (3D)
face-centered-cubic crystal [16]. Up to 26 independent
packets are created with δ- and s-dependent lattice point
ﬁlling factors. Note this surprising behavior occurs in
the setting of incoherent excitation of a non-degenerate
thermal cloud. To obtain qualitative insight into the ba-
sic physics, we begin with an analytic solution to the
one-dimensional (1D) semiclassical radiative force equa-
tion. Here, we show that δ > 0 excitation enables ”pos-
itive feedback” acceleration that eﬃciently bunches the
atoms into discrete sets of δ- and s-dependent velocity
space groups. A simple generalization of the 1D model
is then used to motivate the experimentally observed 3D
lattice structure. This intuitive picture is then conﬁrmed
with numerical calculations of the ﬁnal atomic velocity
and spatial distributions. Using the numerical calcula-
tions, we also show that δ > 0 momentum-space crystals
are a universal feature of standard Doppler cooling and
that observations should be possible, although increas-
ingly impractical, with broad line molasses.

Finally, we demonstrate that R directly inﬂuences δ
> 0 thermodynamics, enabling cooling around a δ- and
s-dependent velocity v0 where gravity balances the radia-
tive force. Observed values for v0 agree well with numeri-
cal predictions while cooling is evident in distinctly asym-
metric cloud spatial distributions that appear in both
numerical calculations of the cooling process and the ex-
periment. As with momentum crystal formation, gravi-
tationally assisted δ > 0 cooling is universal to Doppler
105,
limited systems. In the more typical case where R
however, equilibrium temperatures (v0) are on the order
of hundreds of milli-Kelvin (100 m/s) rather than the
more useful micro-Kelvin (
10 cm/s) values achieved
with narrow lines.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II gives an overview of the 461 nm 1S0 - 1P1
MOT used to pre-cool 88Sr to
2.5 mK. 3P2 metastable
excited-state magnetic traps that are continuously loaded
by the 1S0 - 1P1 cooling cycle are also described. Section
III details the highly stabilized 689 nm light source and
the process used to transfer 88Sr from the 1S0 - 1P1 MOT
to the 1S0 - 3P1 MOT. Descriptions of the techniques
used to control and study 1S0 - 3P1 laser cooling are
also provided. Sections IV and V then focus on δ < 0
mechanical and thermal dynamics, respectively. Finally,
section VI explores δ > 0 cooling and momentum-space
crystals. Conclusions are given in section VII.

1S0 - 1P1 MOT PRE-COOLING

Pre-cooling 88Sr to milli-Kelvin temperatures is an es-
sential requirement for observing 1S0 - 3P1 cooling and
trapping dynamics [1]. For this purpose, as shown by
Fig. 1(b), we use a standard six-beam 461 nm 1S0 - 1P1
MOT that is loaded by a Zeeman slowed and transversely
cooled atomic beam. The atomic beam is generated by
an eﬀusion oven (2 mm nozzle diameter) whose output is
angularly ﬁltered by a 3.6 mm diameter aperture located
19.4 cm from the oven nozzle. Separate heaters maintain
the oven body (nozzle) at 525 oC (725 oC), resulting in a
1011 atoms/s
measured ﬂux (divergence half-angle) of 3
(19 mrad). The atomic beam is then transversely cooled
by 2-dimensional 461 nm optical molasses. The elliptical
cross-section molasses laser beams have a 1/e2 diameter
of
4 mm) along (normal to) the atomic beam
propagation axis, contain 10 - 20 mW of power, and are
detuned from the 1S0 - 1P1 resonance by -15 MHz. Stray

magnetic ﬁelds in the transverse cooling region are less
than 1 G. Subsequently, the atomic beam passes through
a 6.4 mm diameter electro-mechanical shutter and a gate
valve that allows the oven to be isolated from the rest of
the vacuum system.

∼

After exiting the transverse cooling region, the atomic
beam enters a water cooled 20 cm long constant deceler-
ation σ− Zeeman slower [18] with a peak magnetic ﬁeld
of
600 G, corresponding to a capture velocity of
∼
500 m/s. The 461 nm Zeeman slower cooling laser is
detuned from the 1S0 - 1P1 resonance by -1030 MHz,
contains 60 mW of power, and is focused to approxi-
mately match the atomic beam divergence. The window
opposite the atomic beam is a z-cut Sapphire optical ﬂat
that is vacuum sealed via the Kasevich technique [17],
broadband anti-reﬂection coated on the side opposite the
chamber, and heated to 200 oC to prevent the formation
of Sr coatings. The alternating current window heater,
which produces a small stray magnetic ﬁeld, is only op-
erated during the 1S0 - 1P1 MOT pre-cooling phase. A
separate compensation coil reduces the slower magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude (gradient) to < 100 mG (< 8 mG/cm) at
the trapping region, located 15 cm from the slower exit.
Stray magnetic ﬁelds at the trap are further nulled by
three sets of orthogonally oriented Helmholtz pairs.

The trapping chamber is a cylindrical octagon with
six 2 3/4” (two 6”) ports in the horizontal x-y plane
(along gravity z-axis). All windows are broadband anti-
reﬂection coated. The MOT anti-Helmholtz coils, ori-
ented such that the axial magnetic ﬁeld gradient dBz
lies along gravity, are mounted on a computer controlled
precision linear track that allows the coil center to be
1
translated from the trapping chamber to a 1 cm
cm
4 cm rectangular glass cell. The coils are con-
structed to provide window-limited optical access to the
geometric center of the trapping chamber and produce
axial gradients of 0.819 G/(cm-A). The gradient is linear
3 cm in both the axial and
over a spatial range of
transverse directions. Current in the coils is regulated by
a computer controlled servo and monitored with a Hall
probe. For the 1S0 - 1P1 MOT, the axial magnetic ﬁeld
gradient dBz/dz = dBz = 50 G/cm.

The trapping chamber is evacuated by a 40 l/s Ion
pump and a Titanium sublimation pump while the oven
chamber uses a 40 l/s Ion pump. The two chambers are
45 mm cylindrical diﬀerential
separated by a 6.4 mm

shutter and the gate valve. Typical vacuum levels in the

trapping laser beams are controlled with acousto-optic
modulators (AOMs) which are also used as shutters. Ad-
ditional extinction of 461 nm light is provided by electro-
mechanical shutters. The intensity stabilized trapping
beams have 1/e2 diameters of
3 cm, are detuned from
the 1S0 - 1P1 resonance by -40 MHz, and typically have
a total power of 30 mW. For these settings, we ﬁnd the
1S0 - 1P1 MOT population is maximized. Further in-
creases in, for example, the trapping beam power simply
increases the cloud temperature. 1S0 - 1P1 MOTs are
monitored with a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera
and a calibrated photodiode. Typical trap lifetimes, pop-

As shown by Fig. 1(a), operation of the 1S0 - 1P1 MOT
eﬃciently populates the ground-state-like 3P2 metastable
500 s radiative lifetime [20]) via 1P1
excited-state (
3P2 radiative decay. Consequently, 1S0 -

1P1 MOT lifetimes are typically limited to 10 - 50 ms
[21, 22, 23]. To overcome this loss process, 3P2 popula-
tion is re-pumped to the 1S0 ground-state via the 3P2
→
3S1
1S0 channel by driving the 707 nm 3P2 -
3S1 and 679 nm 3P0 - 3S1 transitions with two external
cavity diode lasers (ECDLs). Each laser is locked to a ref-
erence cavity that is simultaneously locked to a frequency
stabilized helium neon laser. Double-passed AOMs are
then used to tune the absolute laser frequencies. After
passing through a single-mode polarization-maintaining
optical ﬁber, the co-propagating 707 nm and 679 nm laser
beams are expanded to a 1/e2 diameter of
1 cm and
delivered to the 1S0 - 1P1 MOT. An AOM located before
the beam expansion optics allows for rapidly turning the
beams either on or oﬀ (< 1 µs transition time). At the
trap, the 707 nm (679 nm) beam contains 1.5 mW (2.5
mW) of power, resulting in an optical re-pumping time
of < 100 µs. With both lasers operating, the 1S0 - 1P1
MOT population and lifetime are typically enhanced by
10

by atomic beam induced trap loss.

1S0 - 3P1 MOT LOADING AND DETECTION

Exploring 689 nm 1S0 - 3P1 narrow line cooling dynam-
ics requires a laser system whose short-term linewidth is
small compared to the 7.5 kHz transition natural width.
In addition, the absolute laser frequency must be refer-
enced, with similar stability, to the 1S0 - 3P1 transition
and be tunable over a range of
10 MHz. Figure 3 shows
the 689 nm laser stabilization and control system consist-
ing of a master-slave ECDL, a temperature stabilized and
vibration isolated passive optical reference cavity, and a
Sr saturated absorption spectrometer.

∼

∼

The linewidth of the master ECDL is ﬁrst narrowed by
locking the laser to a stable optical reference cavity via
the Pound-Drever-Hall technique [35]. The cavity con-
sists of high reﬂectivity Zerodour substrate mirrors that
are optically contacted to a Zerodour spacer. The mea-
sured cavity ﬁnesse (free spectral range) at 689 nm is
3800 (488.9 MHz), giving a linewidth for the TEM00
∼
mode of
130 kHz. To isolate the cavity from environ-
mental perturbations, the cavity is suspended by two thin
wires inside a temperature stabilized can that is evacu-
ated to < 10−6 Torr and mounted on vibration damp-
ing material. The absolute cavity frequency is tuned
by double-passing the 689 nm light sent to the cavity
through a 1 GHz AOM. The electronic feedback, with an
overall bandwidth of
2 MHz is divided into a slow loop
that adjusts the piezo-electric mounted ECDL grating
and a fast loop that couples to the diode laser current.
With the cavity lock engaged, in-loop analysis shows that
jitter in the cavity-laser lock is < 1 Hz.

∼

To further evaluate the performance of the 689 nm
laser system, the short-term laser linewidth is deter-
mined by beating the cavity-locked 689 nm light against
a femto-second comb that is locked to a second optical
cavity [36]. Here, we ﬁnd a short-term linewidth of < 300
Hz, where the measurement is limited by the optical ﬁber
connecting the 689 nm light to the femto-second comb.
Next, the absolute stability of the 689 nm laser is eval-
uated by beating the cavity locked 689 nm light against
a femto-second comb that is locked to a Hydrogen maser
via a ﬁber optical link to NIST [37]. From these measure-
ments, the laser-cavity system drifts
400 mHz/s and
10−13 (i.e., < 180 Hz) with the
has a 1 s stability of < 4

trap formed by the 1S0 - 1P1 MOT quadrupole mag-
netic ﬁeld [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
Importantly, these
samples are expected to display a wealth of binary col-
lision resonances that arise due to an interplay between
anisotropic quadrupole interactions and the local mag-
netic ﬁeld [29, 30, 31]. Qualitatively similar processes
and hence, collision resonances, are predicted for polar
molecules immersed in electrostatic ﬁelds [32]. Studies of
metastable Sr collision dynamics will thus likely impact
the understanding of a diverse range of physical systems.
To pursue these studies, we plan to ﬁrst load 3P2 state
atoms into the quadrupole magnetic trap and then me-
chanically translate [33] the sample to the glass cell cham-
ber. Subsequently, a tight Ioﬀe-Pritchard magnetic trap
will be used to perform a variety of collision experiments.
As a ﬁrst step in this direction we have loaded > 108
3P2(m=1,2) state atoms into the quadrupole magnetic
trap and achieved trap lifetimes > 1 s. For these mea-
surements, the 3P2 trap is ﬁrst loaded by operating the
1S0 - 1P1 MOT for a variable ﬁll time. The 461 nm cool-
ing and trapping lasers and the atomic beam are then
switched oﬀ. Following a variable hold time, the 461 nm
trapping beams and the 707 nm and 679 nm re-pumping
beams are switched on, enabling the 3P2 magnetic trap
population NM to be determined from 461 nm ﬂuores-
cence [25]. Figure 2(a) shows NM versus hold time for
a ﬁll time of 2 s while Fig. 2(b) gives NM versus ﬁll
time at a ﬁxed hold time of 400 ms. For both, dBz = 50
G/cm, giving a magnetic trap depth of
30 mK. The
1S0 - 1P1 MOT lifetime (steady-state population) is 16
107). The observed 1.23(4) s exponential decay
ms (2.8
time agrees well with the expected
1.3 s vacuum limited
value extracted from measurements reported in Ref. [27]
at higher pressures. In contrast, the signiﬁcantly shorter

beams are pulsed on for 10 - 50 µs immediately after
the atoms are released from the trap while for TOF im-
ages, the atoms are allowed to ﬁrst freely expand for a
variable amount of time. We have veriﬁed that in-situ
images recorded with 461 nm pulses are identical to di-
rect images of the in-trap 689 nm ﬂuorescence aside from
an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typical TOF ﬂight
times are 20 - 35 ms. To determine cloud temperatures,
gaussian ﬁts are performed to both the in-situ and TOF

beam shutter are switched oﬀ, dBz is rapidly lowered to
3 G/cm, and red-detuned, broadband frequency modu-
lated 689 nm trapping beams are turned on. 10 ms later
and for the following 50 ms, the cloud is compressed by
linearly increasing dBz to 10 G/cm. Frequency modula-
tion parameters for the 689 nm trapping beams are set
to provide complete spectral coverage of the 1S0 - 1P1
MOT Doppler proﬁle and, as shown below, manipulate
the cloud size at the end of the magnetic ﬁeld ramp.
Subsequently, at t = 60 ms, the frequency modulation is
turned oﬀ and the atoms are held in a single-frequency
MOT. Overall, as shown by the images at the top of Fig.
4, this process reduces the sample temperature by more
than three orders of magnitude while only reducing the
cloud population by a typical factor of 3 - 4, giving ﬁnal

limited by the eﬀective maser noise ﬂoor. To eliminate
the slow 689 nm cavity induced drift, the master ECDL
is next locked to the 1S0 - 3P1 resonance via saturated
absorption feedback to the 1 GHz AOM. For added sta-
bility, a DC magnetic ﬁeld is applied to the Sr vapor cell
and the spectrometer is set to perform frequency mod-
ulation spectroscopy on the 1S0 - 3P1(m=0) transition.
With the system fully locked, the 1 s stability (drift rate)
is then

A portion of the 689 nm master ECDL output is next
used to injection lock a 689 nm slave diode laser. The
slave laser output, after double-passing through an AOM
used for frequency shifting and intensity chopping, is then
coupled into a single-mode polarization-maintaining op-
tical ﬁber. Upon exiting the ﬁber, the 689 nm light,
containing up to 6 mW of power, is expanded to a 1/e2
diameter of 5.2 mm and divided into three equal intensity
trapping beams. Dichroic beamsplitters are then used to
co-align the 689 nm and 461 nm trapping beams. The
trapping beam waveplates are 3λ/4 at 461 nm and λ/4
at 689 nm.

1S0 - 3P1 cooling and trapping dynamics are monitored
either by in-situ or time-of-ﬂight (TOF) ﬂuorescence im-
ages collected with an intensiﬁed CCD camera. The cam-
era is set to view the cloud in either the horizontal x-
y plane or nearly along gravity. The x-y plane (along
gravity) images have a spatial resolution of 21 µm/pixel
(37 µm/pixel). For in-situ images, the 461 nm trapping

g-factor (Bohr magneton). s′ > s accounts, along a sin-
gle axis, for saturation induced by the remaining four
trapping beams. Figure 5(a) shows the 1S0 - 3P1 radia-
tive force at s = s′ = 248 for a range of δ values while
Fig. 6(a) shows the force at δ = -520 kHz for a range
of s = s′ values. As described in section I, the quali-
tative nature of the force and hence the resulting trap
mechanical dynamics depends on the relative size of ∆
and ΓE. For regime (I), corresponding to
> 120 kHz
in Fig. 5(a) or s < 248 in Fig. 6(a), ∆ > ΓE and the
3D radiative force acts only along a thin shell volume
marking the outer trap boundary. Here, the trap bound-
ary roughly corresponds to positions where the radiative
force is peaked. This situation, as shown by Figs. 5(b)
and 6(b), produces a box potential with a gravitation-
ally induced z-axis tilt. Hence, in the x-y plane, motion
consists of free-ﬂight between hard wall boundaries while
along the z-axis, mechanical dynamics are set by the rel-
ative size of the radiative force “kicks,” gravity, and the
cloud thermal energy. As shown in section V, the thermal
energy is small compared to the gravitational potential
energy. Moreover, the ratio of the maximum radiative
force to the gravitational force, R
16. Thus, the atoms
sink to the bottom of the trap where they interact, along
the z-axis, with only the upward propagating trapping
beam.

∼

As δ decreases in Fig. 5(a) or s increases in Fig. 6(a),
the trap mechanically evolves to regime (II) where ∆ <
ΓE produces a linear restoring force and hence, damped
harmonic motion [12, 15]. Consequently the trap po-
tential energy assumes the U-shaped form familiar from
standard broad line Doppler cooling. As the trap moves

more fully into regime (II), perturbations to the poten-
tial energy due to gravity become less pronounced. One
expects, therefore, that the cloud aspect ratio will evolve
toward the 2:1 value set by the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld.
The intuitive descriptions developed above are directly
conﬁrmed by Figs. 5(c) and 6(c) which show in-situ im-
ages of the 1S0 - 3P1 MOT along with overlaid maxi-
mum force contours calculated from Eq. 1. For excita-
tion conditions corresponding to regime (II), the cloud
approaches the 2:1 quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld aspect ra-
tio.
In contrast, for regime (I) the cloud x-y width is
determined largely by the separation between x-y force
maxima or alternatively, by the wall separation for the
x-y potential energy box. In the vertical direction, the
atoms sink to the bottom of the trap where the lower
cloud boundary z0 is deﬁned by the location of the z-axis
potential energy minima which is, in turn, proportional
to the position where the Zeeman shift matches the laser
detuning. As δ increases, z0 shifts vertically downward,
an eﬀect predicted in Fig. 5(b) and clearly revealed in
Fig. 5(c). To quantify this relationship, Fig. 7 shows

dz0/dδ = 2π/(µdBz) = 0.509(4) µm/kHz, in agreement
at the 5% level with the expected linear slope of 0.478(2)
µm/kHz.

Unique 1S0 - 3P1 MOT mechanical dynamics are also
manifest in the transfer between the broadband and
single-frequency cooling stages. Here, it is important to
note that following broadband cooling, the cloud verti-
cal and horizontal 1/e2 radii (rz and rh, respectively) are
set by the ﬁnal value for dBz and the spectral separa-
tion between the blue edge of the modulation spectrum
and the 1S0 - 3P1 resonance. Figure 8(a) shows three
typical modulation spectra while Fig. 8(b) shows in-situ
images of the corresponding broadband cooled clouds at
the end of the magnetic ﬁeld ramp. For each, the mea-
sured temperature is 8.5(0.8) µK. Overlaid dashed lines
give the maximum force contour for the subsequent δ =
-520 kHz, s = 75 single-frequency MOT shown in the
bottom frame. Here, dynamics similar to Fig. 5 are
observed: as the broadband modulation moves closer to
resonance, the cloud density distribution becomes more
symmetric and the aspect ratio evolves toward 2:1. Fig-
ure 8(c) shows the broadband to single-frequency MOT
transfer eﬃciency TE versus broadband spectra number.
Clearly, TE increases as the overlap between the broad-
band cooled cloud and the single-frequency MOT force
contour increases, indicating that TE can be optimized
by “mode-matching” rz and rh to the single-frequency
MOT box. This idea is supported by open circles in Fig.

8(c) which give predicted TE values based on the relative
volume of the broadband cooled cloud and the single-
frequency radiative force curve. Overall, the prediction
reproduces observed TE values with a discrepancy for
spectra 1 and 2 that likely arises from the broadband
MOT density distribution.

Further evidence for broadband to single-frequency
mode-matching is provided by the single-frequency MOT
population N versus δ shown in Fig. 9. Here, solid cir-
cles give N versus δ when rz = 0.79 mm and rh = 1.56
mm. According to the Fig. 5 model, the single-frequency
MOT acquires these dimensions at δ = -1637 kHz, which
lies within 2% of the δ value where N is peaked. Hence,
we again ﬁnd that optimal transfer occurs when rz and rh
are matched to the single-frequency radiative force con-
tour. Additional conﬁrmation for this eﬀect is provided
by open circles in the ﬁgure which give N when rz and
rh are optimized at each δ. To understand the trend in
this case toward smaller N as δ decreases, note the non-
zero slope for the blue edge of the modulation spectrum
sets the minimum eﬀective detuning δm that can be used
during the broadband cooling phase. In analogy to Fig.
5, δm sets minimum values for rz and rh. Thus mode-
matching becomes progressively more diﬃcult as δ de-
creases and the single-frequency radiative force contour
shrinks, leading to the observed decrease in N.

δ < 0 THERMODYNAMICS

δ < 0 1S0 - 3P1 MOTs display a rich variety of ther-
modynamic behaviors that are directly linked to the me-
chanical dynamics explored in section IV. Figure 10(a)
shows the MOT equilibrium temperature TM versus δ for
saturation parameters ranging from s = 7.5 to s = 1800.
For large δ and s, corresponding to regime (I), ∆ > ΓE
Γ, TM is basically δ-independent. Insight into this be-

havior is provided by Fig. 11(a), which details the unique
regime (I) connection between trap thermodynamics, the
spatial dependence of the radiative force, and the relative
size of the radiative force and gravity. Recall that for ∆

> ΓE, the cloud sags to the bottom of the trap where in-
teractions occur, along the vertical z-axis, with only the
upward propagating trapping beam. Moreover, due to
polarization considerations and the free-ﬂight motion ex-
ecuted by atoms in the horizontal plane, horizontal beam
absorption rates are more than 4
smaller than the verti-
cal rate. Trap thermodynamics, therefore, are dominated
by a balance between gravity and the radiative force due
to the upward propagating beam. Here, it is important
to realize that as δ changes, the z-axis atomic position z0
self adjusts such that the eﬀective detuning, ∆ - µdBzz0,
remains constant. Consequently the trap damping and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients, and thus the equilibrium tempera-
ture, remain constant.

δ > 0 COOLING AND MOMENTUM-SPACE

CRYSTALS

Tuning to δ > 0 during the single-frequency cooling
stage reveals two fundamental and unique physical pro-
cesses: (1) the creation of well-deﬁned momentum pack-
ets whose velocity space alignment mimics lattice points
on a face-centered cubic crystal and (2) laser cooling
around a velocity v0 where the radiative force balances
gravity. In the following, we explore these two eﬀects in
detail.

Basic insight into δ > 0 momentum packet formation
can be obtained by considering the elementary problem
of 1D atomic motion in the presence of two counter-
propagating δ > 0 light ﬁelds. For simplicity, we assume
~dB = 0. According to Eq. 1, an atom with initial veloc-
ity ~vi will preferentially interact with the ﬁeld for which
~k
~vi > 0. Hence, the absorption process preferentially
accelerates rather than decelerates the atom, further de-
creasing the probability for absorption events that slow
the atomic motion and enabling ”positive feedback” in
velocity space. This process terminates for ﬁnal veloci-
ties vf satisfying

where T0, realized at ∆ = ΓE/2, is a generalized version
1 Doppler limit. As shown by the solid lines
of the s

shape of the data. As shown by Fig. 10(c), however,
matching the absolute data values requires multiplying
1) whose
Eq. 7 by a s-dependent global scaling factor (
value decreases with s, leading to temperatures well be-
low the standard Doppler limit T0. In contrast to ordi-
nary Doppler cooling, the cloud thermal energy in regime
(II) is thus not limited by half the eﬀective energy width
of the cooling transition. Notably, we ﬁnd this surprising
result cannot be explained either by analytic treatments
of Eq. 1 or semiclassical Monte-Carlo simulations of the
cooling process. The Monte-Carlo simulations, in fact,
simply reproduce standard Doppler theory. Finally, as s
approaches unity in Fig. 10(b), the trap enters regime
kBT/~ and thus the cooling be-
(III) where Γ
comes fully quantum mechanical. Here, we obtain a min-
imum temperature of 250(20) nK, in good agreement
with the quantum mechanically predicted value of half
the photon recoil temperature TR/2 = ~ωR/kB = 230
nK [14].

The approach to thermal equilibrium also displays sig-
natures of regimes (I) - (III). Figure 12(a) gives the cloud
temperature versus time for a δ = -520 kHz, s = 248
single-frequency MOT. As shown by the ﬁgure inset, the
data is well ﬁt by a single exponential aside from the
rapid decrease for times < 5 ms that arises from atoms
falling outside the trap capture velocity [8, 9]. Recall
from Fig. 10 that scanning s at this detuning provides
access to all three cooling regimes, each of which is char-

Figures 13(a) and 13(b) show plots of Eq. 12 at δ = 80
kHz and δ = 200 kHz, respectively. For both, s = 30 or
s = 300. The chosen vi values of 0.1 cm/s, 5 cm/s, and
10 cm/s span the velocity distribution for a 12 µK cloud.
Assuming an interaction time of 25 ms, Fig. 13(a) clearly
shows that due to laser induced acceleration, the entire
range of initial velocities is rapidly bunched to a signif-
icantly reduced range of ﬁnal velocities. Considering a
fully 1D situation, this result implies the cloud is divided
into two well deﬁned and oppositely moving packets. As

= 300 the transition to two groups does not occur until
δ
400 kHz. Accounting again for the full 1D symme-
try, the s = 30 case corresponds to dividing the t = 0
cloud into three groups, two that move in opposite direc-
tions with relatively large ﬁnal velocities and one that,
in comparison, is nearly stationary. Overall, Eq. 11 thus
predicts that for δ > 0 the atomic cloud evolves into a
discrete set of momentum-space packets. As s decreases
at ﬁxed δ, the number of packets increases while, as pre-
dicted by Eq. 10, the mean velocity for a given packet
scales with both δ and s.

Generalizing this analysis to the full 3D molasses beam
geometry leads to the structure shown in Fig. 13(c): a
3D array of momentum-space groups whose alignment
mimics the lattice points on a face-centered-cubic crys-
tal. From symmetry considerations, cube corners corre-
spond to three beam interactions in which the cloud is
divided into two pieces along each coordinate axis. From
Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), these points have a δ- and s-
dependent mean velocity and appear at relatively small
detunings. For larger δ values, two-beam interactions ﬁll
points along the Fig. 13(c) corner connecting lines. In
analogy to s = 30 in Fig. 13(b), atoms in these points
have vi
0 along a single axis and thus remain nearly sta-
tionary. Along the remaining two axes, however, vi > 0,
enabling acceleration to larger vf . The 3-beam to 2-beam
transition, as shown in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), occurs at
progressively larger δ values as s increases. Together, the
two processes form a total of 20 divided groups with 8, 4,
and 8 packets in the top, middle, and bottom layers of the
cube, respectively. Finally, as δ increases further, atoms
0 along two axes experience acceleration only
with vi
along a single axis, producing the 1-beam lattice points
shown as 6 open circles in the Fig. 13(c) cube face cen-
ters.

Figure 14 shows an array of top view (slightly oﬀ ver-

interaction time is ﬁxed at tH = 25 ms (tV = 25 ms) in
the horizontal x-y plane (along z-axis) molasses beams.
The initial tH = tV = 0 cloud temperature is 11.5(2)
µK. Here, the observed cloud evolution agrees well with
the qualitative predictions developed from the Fig. 13
model. As δ increases at ﬁxed s, sets of n-beam lattice
points sequentially ﬁll with n = 3 ﬁlling ﬁrst followed by
n = 2,1. Moreover, as s increases, transitions between
the n-beam processes occur at progressively larger δ val-
ues. Finally, for ﬁxed δ, the mean lattice point velocity,
proportional to the resulting lattice point spacing in the
Fig. 14 images, scales with s as expected from both Eq.
10 and Fig. 13. Note that qualitatively similar dynam-
ics are observed for
= 0. The detailed changes to
the cloud evolution that result from this situation are
described below.

The intuitive understanding of δ > 0 dynamics devel-
oped above is conﬁrmed by Fig. 15. Here, we show nu-
merical calculations based on Eq. 1 of the ﬁnal horizontal
velocity and spatial distributions for the s = 30 column
and δ = 120 kHz row in Fig. 14. For the calculations,
~dB
= 0, tH = 25 ms, and the initial cloud temperature
|
is 11.5 µK. The Figs. 15(c) and 15(d) spatial distribu-
tions should be compared to cube lines in the x-y plane
along the Fig. 14 x-y molasses beam propagation direc-
tions. Importantly, this fully 1D model reproduces both
the Fig. 14 observations and the Fig. 13 predictions for
the δ- and s-dependent lattice point ﬁlling factors and
mean lattice point velocity. As expected, the temper-
ature of each packet in its moving frame is lower than
the tH = tV = 0 ms atomic cloud, a result arising from
the previously described velocity bunching eﬀects and di-
rectly connected to cloud shape asymmetries observed in
both the experiment (note the sharp outer cloud edges)
and the Fig. 15 theory. Notably, however, only two ver-
tical layers are observed in Fig. 14 while the Fig. 13
model predicts three. As explained below, this appar-

tails of the crystal formation process will make exper-
imental observations diﬃcult. From Eq. 10, vf for a
given packet is proportional to Γ. Hence, broad line
packet velocities are orders of magnitude larger than
those achieved in the narrow line case. In Fig. 16, for
example, vf
60 m/s. Visualizing the entire structure
then requires imaging light with an optical bandwidth of
260 MHz or an equivalently broad optical transition.
∼
This situation should be compared to the experiments
performed here where vf < 1 m/s, and hence suﬃcient
imaging bandwidth is obtained with the Γ/2π = 32 MHz
1S0 - 1P1 transition. In addition, Γ sets the lattice point
spacing, or alternatively the molasses beam diameter, re-
quired to achieve a given contrast between individual lat-
tice points. For the contrast shown in Figs. 14 and 15,
for example, the required broad line molasses beam diam-
eters grow to tens of centimeters, making experimental
observations impractical.

Figure 17(a) shows in-situ images of the 689 nm δ > 0
molasses when the cloud is viewed in the horizontal x-y
plane at 45o to the x-y axes. For the images,
= 0, s
= 30, δ = 140 kHz, tH = 25 ms, and tV is varied from tV
= 0 ms to tV = 25 ms. Here, the apparent contradiction
between Fig. 14 and the Fig. 13(c) prediction for the
number of vertical layers is shown to occur due to gravity
induced dynamics.
Increasing tV from tV = 0 ms to
tV = 6 ms, for example, creates three vertical layers,
as predicted by Fig. 13(c). For tV > 6 ms, however,
the lower two layers slowly merge together, becoming a
single cloud along the vertical direction for tV > 21 ms.
To understand this process, recall that the central layer
in the Fig. 13(c) cube corresponds to atoms with near
zero z-axis velocities. For the chosen δ and in the absence
of gravity, therefore, these atoms would remain near vz =
0. As shown by the numerical calculations in Figs. 17(b)
and 17(c), however, gravity accelerates the central layer
into resonance with the downward propagating molasses
beam, causing the two downward propagating layers to
merge. For the tV = 25 ms time used in Fig. 14, this
process is complete. Hence, only two layers are observed
with the more (less) intense packets in the Fig. 14 images
corresponding to the lower two (uppermost) cube layers.

At this point, it is important to realize that Eq. 1
is semiclassical and thus does not account for dynam-
ics that depend on the relative size of Γ and ωR. The
δ > 0 momentum crystals observed here, therefore, are
a universal feature of Doppler limited systems. Similar
processes should then occur with broad lines such as the
461 nm 1S0 - 1P1 transition. To test this possibility, Fig.
16 shows numerically simulated ﬁnal horizontal velocity
and spatial distributions for a 2.5 mK 88Sr cloud excited
by 461 nm δ > 0 optical molasses. For the calculation,
~dB
= 0, tH = 500 µs, and s = 2. As clearly indicated by
|
the ﬁgure, structures very similar to those shown in Fig.
14 can be generated over length scales consistent with 461
nm cooling beam diameters and typical 1S0 - 1P1 MOT
temperatures. Moreover, we ﬁnd that by increasing ei-
ther s or tH , structures with contrast identical to those
shown in Figs. 14 and 15 can be created. Note the model
does not account for spontaneous emission induced ran-
dom walk heating, a process the would tend to smear the
contrast between individual momentum packets. This
omission, however, should not signiﬁcantly aﬀect Fig. 16
since random walk heating scales as √Γ [12] while, from
Eq. 1, the directional acceleration scales as Γ. Thus, as Γ
increases from the narrow to the broad line case, random
walk heating becomes progressively less important.

Although the physics underlying δ > 0 momentum-
space crystals is thus fully operative for broad lines, de-

tributions with Figs. 14 and 17(a) reveals that theoreti-
cally predicted
larger
than observed. This result occurs due to stray magnetic
ﬁelds. Here, an independently measured
100 mG/cm
permanent chamber magnetization spatially shifts the ef-
fective detuning as the atoms move outward, causing an
apparent deceleration and thus reduced lattice spacing.
This eﬀect can be seen most clearly by measuring the ver-
tical position of the upward moving cube layer zT versus
tV . For the upward moving layer, Eq. 1 predicts that the
atoms are accelerated to a velocity v0 where the radiative
force balances gravity. The cloud then moves upward at
v0 and hence, experiences an eﬀective acceleration ge =
0. To test for a magnetic ﬁeld induced non-zero ge, Fig.
18 shows zT versus tV for s = 30 and δ = 140 kHz. The
solid line in the ﬁgure is a ﬁt to the simple kinematic
equation zT = z0 + v0tV - (get2
V )/2. Here, v0 is treated
as an initial velocity since for s = 30 and δ = 140 kHz,
the atoms are accelerated to v0 in < 2 ms. From the
ﬁt, we ﬁnd ge = -0.98(16) m/s2, consistent with a stray
gradient dBz = 100 mG/cm. Once this gradient is in-
cluded in numerical calculations of Eq. 1, the measured
and calculated lattice point spacings agree.

Finally, the exceptionally sharp velocity and thus spa-
tial distributions for the upward propagating layer in Fig.
17 imply velocity compression beyond the bunching ef-
fects described earlier. In fact, as shown by Fig. 19(a)
which depicts the composite gravitational and radiative
force for the upward moving atoms, stable cooling occurs
around v0 where the composite force is zero. From Eq.
2, v0 is given by

which depends linearly on ∆ and scales approximately as
ΓE. Fig. 19(b) shows measured values for v0 versus δ at
s = 10 and s = 75, clearly demonstrating the expected
linear δ-dependence. To obtain quantitative comparisons
with theory, we next perform linear ﬁts to the data and
then obtain predicted values for v0 from numerical cal-
culations that include the 100 mG/cm ﬁeld gradient dis-
cussed above. From the experiment, we ﬁnd (∂v0/∂δ) =
644(17) µm/(kHz-s) at s = 10 and 634(19) µm/(kHz-s)
at s = 75. These slopes agree at the 10% level with the
predicted values of (∂v0/∂δ) = 572(5) µm/(kHz-s) at s =
10 and 638(20) µm/(kHz-s) at s = 75. Moreover, exper-
imentally observed absolute values for v0 are reproduced
by the calculations at the level of 20%, in good agreement
with the expected Eq. 13 intensity dependence.

The equilibrium temperature of the upward moving
layer can be calculated by following the same procedure
used to derive Eq. 6. Here, however, we set µdBzz = 0
in Eq. 2 and perform the Taylor expansion about vz =
v0. The δ-independent eﬀective detuning is then

which leads to damping and diﬀusion coeﬃcients iden-
tical to Eq. 4 and 5, respectively. Hence, the expected
equilibrium temperature is given by Eq. 6. Thus, grav-
ity, via the ratio R, again plays an important role in
narrow line thermodynamics, in this case enabling δ >
0 cooling. Unfortunately, this prediction cannot be ac-
curately veriﬁed due to spatial overlap among the hor-
izontal plane packets in the upward moving cube layer.
The observed and theoretically predicted sharp vertical
spatial distributions in Figs. 17(a) and 17(c), however,
strongly suggest that δ > 0 cooling is operative in the
experiment. Finally, note that although this same cool-
ing mechanism should occur for broad lines where R

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, narrow line laser cooling exhibits a wealth
of behaviors ranging from novel semiclassical dynamics
wherein gravity can play an essential role to quantum me-
chanically dominated sub-photon recoil cooling. In the
δ < 0 semiclassical case, trap dynamics are set by either
hard wall boundaries or a linear restoring force. Qualita-
tive diﬀerences between these two situations are reﬂected
in both the atomic motion and the equilibrium thermo-
dynamics. Here, mechanical dynamics range from free-
ﬂight in a box potential to damped harmonic oscillation.
Accordingly, equilibrium temperatures range from detun-
ing independent values scaled by the power-broadened
transition linewidth to detuning dependent minima well
below the standard Doppler limit. As the saturation pa-
rameter approaches unity, the trap enters a quantum me-
chanical regime where temperatures fall below the pho-
ton recoil limit despite the incoherent trapping beam ex-

citation. For δ > 0, the cloud divides into momentum-
space crystals containing up to 26 well deﬁned lattice
points and the system exhibits δ > 0 gravitationally as-
sisted cooling. These surprising δ > 0 behaviors, which
again occur due to an incoherent process, are theoreti-
cally universal features of Doppler limited systems. Ob-
servations should therefore be possible, although diﬃcult,
with broad line optical molasses. Perhaps a similar δ >

0 mechanical evolution also occurs for atoms, such as the
more typically employed Alkali metals, that support both
Doppler and sub-Doppler cooling.

Imaginary- and real-time versions of an equation for the condensate density are presented which
describe dynamics and decay of any spherical Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) within the mean
ﬁeld approach. We obtain quantized energies of collective, ﬁnite amplitude radial oscillations and
exact numerical instanton solutions which describe quantum tunneling from both the metastable
and radially excited states of the BEC of 7Li atoms. The mass parameter for the radial motion is
found diﬀerent from the gaussian value assumed hitherto, but the eﬀect of this diﬀerence on decay
exponents is small. The collective breathing states form slightly compressed harmonic spectrum,
n=4 state lying lower than the second Bogoliubov (small amplitude) mode. The decay of these
states, if excited, may simulate a shorter than true lifetime of the metastable state. By scaling
arguments, results extend to other attractive BECs.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a series of experiments [1–4], a nonuniform Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 7Li atoms was formed and proved
1300, in agreement with theoretical predictions [5–7]. Due to
metastable for atom numbers N < Nc with Nc ≈
attraction between atoms, such condensate is bound to collapse when N > Nc, but it may collapse also for N < Nc
via quantum or thermal tunneling. Within the mean-ﬁeld appraoch, BEC is described by one wave function. Our
aim in this work was to ﬁnd the exact mean-ﬁeld description of the quantum tunneling in this simplest conceivable
many-body system. Our additional motivation is the recently demonstarted ability to control the interaction of 85Rb
atoms in BEC [8], which opens a new perspective to systematic experimental checks on quantum tunneling.

Up to now, studies of the quantum tunneling of BEC relied on assuming gaussian wave functions [6], at least in
assigning the mass parameter [7]. Strictly speaking, once the mean ﬁeld equation is speciﬁed, there is no place for such
an assumption: This equation, taking a form of the nonlinear ﬁeld equation, by itself determines the dynamics. To
ﬁnd solutions which correspond to quantum decay we use the method of instantons, i.e. ﬁelds evolving in imaginary
time [9], carried over to mean-ﬁeld theories of many-body systems [10,11]. It gives the decay rate Γ = Ae−S, with
the exponent S being the action for the optimal mean-ﬁeld instanton, called bounce. We ﬁnd the exact instantons for
spherical BEC by ﬁrst transforming the original imaginary-time mean-ﬁeld equation to an equation for the condensate
density, and then solving it numerically. Having done that wa can check the gaussian ansatz.

The real-time version of the obtained equation encompasses ﬁnite amplitude collective radial oscillations of BEC.
Applying quantization rule we ﬁnd energies of radial eigenmodes. By using imaginary-time dynamics we also ﬁnd
periodic instantons determining decay exponents of these breathing modes. In this way, the collective dynamics of an
attractive spherical condensate close to instability is obtained from the mean ﬁeld equation.

We assume that the dynamics of BEC is governed by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [12]

In the present work we consider a harmonic, spherically symmetric trap Vtrap = 1

Quantum tunneling of BEC is described by a speciﬁc solution to the equation

obtained from (2) by a transition to imaginary time, t
as φ(r, t)∗ is replaced by φ(r,
iτ . This makes Eq.(3) nonlocal in time. Bounce has to satisfy the
boundary conditions of 1) periodicity, φ(r, τp/2) = φ(r,
τp/2) = φ0(r) = rψ0(r), with ψ0(r) the amplitude of the

metastable state, and 2) barrier penetration, i.e. φ(r, τ = 0) has to be some state of BEC at the other side of the
potential barrier. Eq. (3) preserves both the normalization 4π

Since Eq.(3) is real and the boundary value φ0(r) may be taken real, we assume real φ(r, τ ) in the following.

Now the point is to transform the nonlocal in time instanton equation (3) into an evolution equation for the
condensate density. A transformation of the real-time GPE (2) to a ﬂuid-dynamic form provides an analogy, but is
conceptually simpler.

The bounce equation (3), with the boundary conditions speciﬁed above, splits into two time-local equations for the

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have solved Eq.(8) using the variable Q rather than τ . An initial sequence of densities ρs(r, Qi), with 30-50 Qi
points covering the barrier region, was constructed by minimizing V [ρ] (10) under the constraint Q = Qi. These
constrained stationary densities were then improved upon iteratively. The details of ρ1/2/r, the counterpart of ψ of
Eq. (1), are obtained more precisely when the r2 behaviour near r = 0 and the harmonic oscillator asymptotics at
inﬁnity are factored out in Eq.(8). In numerical work, we use a function α(r, τ ) such that ρ(r, τ ) = r2e−r
e2α(r,τ ),
and properly express the term ∂2
τ f

∂r((∂τ f )2/ρ) - see Appendix.

We also performed the minimization of the functional (9) treating ρ(rj, Qi) as independent variables. It turns out

−

that ρ(r, τ ) thus obtained do not fulﬁl Eq.(8) accurately, but the accuracy in S is better than 0.1%.

The numerical results have been obtained with physical data on 7Li adopted after the most accurate treatment
N , and we obtain the critical value Kc between –7.2249 and

10−3

5.74

up to date [7]. These values give K =

–7.2255 ( Nc between 1258.7 and 1258.8).

The potential energy V (Q) from the bounce solutions (Fig.1), nearly identical with V [ρs(Q)] for constrained sta-
tionary ρs(r, Qi), is very ﬂat between Q(0) and Q(τp/2) for N
Nc. For smaller N , it becomes quite peaked around
≈
the summit, and its fall on the side of small Q becomes very steep. All the obtained bounce solutions result from
N (and increasing ˙Q2 and ¨Q terms, cf Eq.(A4)) this
the small adjustment of the initial densities. For larger Nc −
adjustment becomes gradually more diﬃcult. We could not obtain the exact solution of Eq.(8) (or even a constrained
stationary ρs(r, Qi) for small Qi) for N

1200.

The mass parameters B(Q) from various instanton solutions (Fig.2) are nearly identical which shows that there
exists a universal inertia for the radial collective motion of BEC close to instability. This may be understood as a
consequence of a nearly static character of solutions f (r, Q) in the limited range of N (K) values of interest: f depends
weakly on N close to critical Nc.

For a gaussian density with a variable width b(τ ), ρ(r, τ ) = π−3/2b−3r2exp(

r2/b2), the current j = ˙b(r/b)ρ
−
0 r2ρdr = 3/2 (cf [6,14]). Hence, as for the gaussian density
(Eq.(6)), and the mass parameter B(b) = 4π/b2
Q = 3b2/2, one has 4QB(Q) = B(√Q) = 1, as used in Ref. [7]. As seen in Fig.2, this is a fair assumption near
R
the metastable minima, much worse though for smaller Q around the barrier’s summit. The error in S due to the
gaussian value of B amounts to 3-4% in the cases studied.

The bounce ”amplitude”, √ρ/r (Fig.3), diﬀers from the constrained stationary values √ρs/r mostly near r = 0 and
for small Q, by up to 1%. Decay exponents calculated with the initial densities ρs(r, Qi) are only up to 0.3% larger
than the exact ones.

Next we turn to collective radial oscillations of BEC and their decay rates. Quantum tunneling from the excited
state with energy ¯hωn may be treated by solving Eq.(8) as before, except that now the period τp must be ﬁnite and
N

+ ¯hωn. One has to ﬁx the boundary values ρ(r, τp/2) and the energies ¯hωn.

E
The energies ¯hωn of the excited quantum states follow from the quantization condition S = 2nπ [15], where
S = 2N
V (Q)), cf Eq.(9), with the period tp depending on ¯hωn. Essentially, the imaginary-
time boundary value ρ(r, τp/2) should match the real-time oscillatory solution ρ(r, tp/2) at the turning point Q at
which V (Q) =

We could not solve the real-time version of Eq.(8) as accurately as for instantons. However, since the action S is
insensitive to the details of solution, the lowest quantized ¯hωn are quite accurate. Their comparison to frequencies of
the small amplitude oscillations, obtained from the GPE linearized around ψ0 (so called Bogolyubov spectrum, see
[16]), is interesting. The ﬁrst radial excitation, ¯hω1, is nearly equal, but little smaller than, the lowest Bogolyubov
mode corresponding to the small amplitude limit, except that it may not exist for a too shallow V (Q), like for
N = 1255. The higher modes, ¯hωn, n = 2, 3, ..., come out roughly at the multiples of ¯hω1 (Table 1), and thus

represent nearly harmonic spectrum of collective radial oscillations. Its n = 2, 3, 4 states are lower than the second
Bogolyubov mode, lying slightly above 4¯hω0.

Using the quantized oscillation energies we have found periodic instantons and calculated decay exponents for some
low collective radial excitations. Such instanton with a period τp is quite similar to the so-called ”thermon” which
describes thermal decay from the metastable ground state at the temperature kT = ¯h/τp [17]. This similarity is easily
understood: Thermal decay goes via thermal excitation of quantum states above the metastable ground state and
successive tunneling from them through the smaller barrier. At higher temperatures, details of the excitation spectrum
and tunneling become irrelevant and the thermal tunneling rate exp(
Eb the barrier
energy, replaces a thermal mixture of rates exp(
Sn) from a few lowest excited states at small temperature. The
critical temperature Tc at which this happens is usually determined as the one at which Γthermal(Tc) = Γthermon(Tc).
Numerical results are collected in Table 1. Those in columns 2-4 depend only on K and relate to all BEC-s with
attractive interaction. Decay rates Γ from the metastable 7Li BEC were calculated for ω0 = 908.41 s−1 [2], assuming
prefactor (Γ/ω0)eS = (ω1/ω0)(15S/2π)1/2 [6], with ω1 from the small amplitude limit. The exact prefactor is diﬃcult
to calculate, but it must be of the same order as in Table 1. Obtained values of Γ are very close to those of Ref. [7],
where the eﬀect of too small B-s is fortuitously reduced by half by the interpolation overestimating V (Q).

The decrease of the decay exponents Sn with the mode number n and their comparison to exponents S for the
ground state are seen in Table 1, col. 5. For example, quantum decay of the n = 2 radial mode in BEC with
N = 1245 is nearly as quick as for the ground state of the N = 1255 BEC. The crossover temperature Tc at
which the thermal decay begins to dominate over the quantum tunneling is approximated, neglecting prefactors, as

In summary, the equations for the condensate density, describing both the real- and imaginary-time dynamics of
spherical BEC, were formulated and the exact instanton solutions were found numerically, also for collective radial
excitations. The determined mass parameter (Fig. 2) deviates from the gaussian ansatz, but the calculated decay
exponents for the metastable states agree well with Ref. [7].
It follows from Fig.2 that the exact mass parametr
may be more relevant to the behind-the-barrier collapse phase, i.e for smaller Q. The quantized energies of collective

ﬁnite amplitude radial vibrations form nearly harmonic (slightly compressed) spectrum with ωn ≈
slightly lower than the lowest Bogolyubov mode. The n = 2, 3, 4 collective oscillation states lie lower than the second
Bogolyubov mode. Any excitation (thermal or otherwise, e.g. by modulation of the trapping oscillator frequancy) of
these collective vibrations must lead to a faster decay of the condensate, as the Table 1 shows.

If quantum tunneling is not to be overshadowed by thermal decay, the experiments should proceed at low T and/or
large ω0. Since theoretical results are more certain away from Nc, where the exponent S dominates decay, one should
probe a range of moderate S, giving observable, but not too large Γ (perhaps, by discarding prompt collapses). The
corresponding range of Nc −

Fi we solve (A4) as the ordinary diﬀerential equation in s to obtain new α(s, Qi). The method, as for the stationary
case, is to adjust the asympotic form (A2) to the proper regularity condition at s = 0. The new and old Fi-s are
combined to provide initial Fi-s for the next iteration. With a careful modiﬁcation of Fi-s this iteration leads to the
self-consistency, i.e. Fi(old) = Fi(new). The initial densities ρs(s, Qi) are obtained using the constrained imaginary-
time step Hartree procedure. We use the Runge-Kutta-Merson procedure for integration of Eqs.(A4). Energies are
calculated using a mesh of 128 equidistant points, r/d0 = 0
4.5, and the cubic spline interpolation for derivatives.
We have checked that doubling the mesh density does not change results in any appreciable manner.

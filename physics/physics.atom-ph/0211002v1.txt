Three-body loss of trapped ultracold 87Rb atoms due to a Feshbach resonance

The loss of ultracold trapped atoms in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance is treated as a two-
stage reaction, using the Breit-Wigner theory. The ﬁrst stage is the formation of a resonant diatomic
molecule, and the second one is its deactivation by inelastic collisions with other atoms. This model
−11
is applied to the analysis of recent experiments on 87Rb, leading to an estimated value of 6 × 10
cm3/s for the deactivation rate coeﬃcient.

The phenomenon of Feshbach resonance has received
recently an increased attention due to its application to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) (see Ref. [1] and ref-
erences therein). Its most outstanding eﬀect is a drastic
change of the elastic scattering length as the collision en-
ergy of an atomic pair approaches the energy of a bound
level belonging to another electronic or hyperﬁne state.
The resonance can be tuned by applying an external
magnetic ﬁeld, as has been proposed in Ref. [2] in order
to control BEC properties. Applications include a con-
trolled BEC collapse [3] and bright solitons in BEC [4, 5],
as well as a formation of molecular BEC [1, 6, 7, 8, 9],
an atom-molecule coherent superposition [10, 11], and an
entangled atomic gas [9].

Another eﬀect of the resonance is the abrupt increase
in atom loss due to inelastic collisions of the resonant
molecules [1, 6, 8, 12], and to the formation of non-
condensate atoms [7, 8, 13]. Determination of the loss
parameters is important for an appreciation of the out-
come of applications of Feshbach resonances. We present
here an estimate of the rate coeﬃcient for the deactiva-
tion of vibrationally excited resonant 87Rb2 molecules by
collisions with other Rb atoms, based on the results of
recent experiments [14].

The theory presented in Refs. [1, 6, 8, 12], based on
coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for atomic and molec-
ular condensates, cannot be applied to the analysis of
these experiments involving a non-condensed, thermal
gas. The approach used here is based on the Breit-
Wigner theory of resonant multichannel collisions (see
e.g. Ref. [15]), as has been proposed for the system un-
der consideration by Ref. [7]. The channels of the reac-
tion involving the excited resonant molecule Rb2 (m) are
its formation from the colliding atoms (and the reverse
decay into two atoms),

Rb + Rb ⇄ Rb2 (m) ,

and exoergic collisions with a third atom,

Rb2 (m) + Rb → Rb2 (d) + Rb,

(1)

(2)

bringing the molecule down to one of the lower-lying rovi-
brational levels of the same spin state or to levels belong-
ing to another spin state.

Let us consider all atoms, for the time being, as dis-
tinguishable particles. According to standard theory (see

Ref. [15]), the natural resonance width Γe associated with
channel (1) is two times smaller than the corresponding
width for the case of indistinguishable atoms derived in
Ref. [7].
It exhibits a Wigner threshold dependence of
the form

Γe =

|aa|µ∆

(5)

where aa is the non-resonant (background) elastic scat-
tering length, µ is the diﬀerence between the magnetic
momenta of the atomic pair and the Rb2 (m) molecule, ∆
is the phenomenological resonance strength (see Ref. [1]),
and p is the relative momentum of the colliding atoms.
These parameters also describe the variation of the elastic
scattering length ares as a function of an external mag-
netic ﬁeld B in the vicinity of the resonance at B = B0
as

The total width Γd associated with the deactivation chan-
nels (2) can be expressed in terms of a corresponding
two-body rate coeﬃcient kd as

Γd = kdn,

proportional to the atomic density n. The rate coeﬃ-
cient kd includes the contributions of all the deactivation
channels (d) of Eq. (2).

The Breit-Wigner theory leads to the following expres-
sion for the cross section of resonance-enhanced three-
body recombination (see Ref. [7]),

This expression does not take into account the indistin-
guishability of the three participating atoms. According
to standard theory (see Ref. [15]) the cross section for
the case of three indistinguishable atoms is σind = 3!σ.

Under the conditions of the experiments [14] (aa ≈
98.96 atomic units, µ ≈ 2.8 Bohr magnetons, ∆ ≈ 0.17
G for the strongest resonance at 1007.34 G in 87Rb, and
a collision energy of p2/m ≈ 2µK), the width calculated
with Eq. (3) is Γe ≈ 7µK, which is less than the trap

2

depth of ≈ 20µK. Therefore a spontaneous dissociation
of the resonant molecule (1) cannot lead to the loss of
trapped atoms (as opposed to the case of a BEC – see
Refs. [7, 8]). Each deactivating event (2) leads to the si-
multaneous loss of three atoms. Therefore, neglecting ef-
fects of atom transport, a kinetic equation for the atomic
density n (r, t) can be written in the form

˙n (r, t) = −3

is the three-body loss rate coeﬃcient. Here the partial
inelastic width Γd is neglected in the denominator in com-
parison to Γe. Even very close to the resonance, as long
as |B − B0| > 0.1 G, the width Γe may well be neglected
too, leading to an expression similar to Eq. (9) of Ref.
[12] for the loss in BEC. However, the rate coeﬃcient
given by Eq. (8) is six times larger than the correspond-
ing rate for BEC. This diﬀerence, due to the eﬀects of
quantum statistics, has been predicted for non-resonant
three-body recombination in Ref. [16], and observed in
experiments [17].

FIG. 1: Number of remaining atoms as a function of the

rate coeﬃcient kd = 0.6×10−10 cm3/s (solid line), 1.4×10−10

Equation (12), in combination with Eqs. (3), (8), and
(11), allows us to estimate the value of kd by a ﬁt to
the number of remaining atoms as measured in Ref. [14],
given N0 = 4.6 × 106, T = 2µK, t = 50 ms, ωr = 930
2πHz, and ωa = 11 2πHz. The ﬁt produces an optimal
value of kd ≈ 1.4 × 10−10 cm3/s. The calculated re-
sults are compared with the experimental results of Ref.
[14] in Fig. 1. As one can see, the present model does
not reproduce the asymmetric shape of the atom loss
observed in the experiments, especially the sudden jump
below the resonance. The ﬁt to the experimental data ei-
ther below or above resonance produce the optimal values
kd ≈ 2×10−10 cm3/s and kd ≈ 0.6×10−10 cm3/s, respec-
tively. The latter value of kd is in good agreement with
the experimental data along the full range of B values –
except at the plateau observed below the resonance, fol-
lowing the sudden jump around 1004.5 G. We therefore
propose the value of kd ≈ 0.6 × 10−10 cm3/s as a best
estimate of the rate coeﬃcient for deactivating collisions.
This value is smaller than the corresponding value for Na
(1.6 × 10−10 cm3/s, see Ref. [8]). The observed plateau
is still unaccounted for, remaining (as noted in [14]) the
subject of future investigations.

The authors are most grateful to Dr. Stephan D¨urr for
providing a preprint of Ref. [14] and clarifying details of
the experiments.

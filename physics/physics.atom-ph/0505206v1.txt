Abstract

We introduce an ad-hoc electrodynamics with advanced and retarded Li´enard-Wiechert interac-

tions plus the dissipative Lorentz-Dirac self-interaction force. We study the covariant dynamical

system of the electromagnetic two-body problem, i.e., the hydrogen atom. We perform the linear

stability analysis of circular orbits for oscillations perpendicular to the orbital plane. In particular

we study the normal modes of the linearized dynamics that have an arbitrarily large imaginary

eigenvalue. These large eigenvalues are fast frequencies that introduce a fast (stiﬀ) timescale into

the dynamics. As an application, we study the phenomenon of resonant dissipation, i.e., a motion

where both particles recoil together in a drifting circular orbit (a bound state), while the atom

dissipates center-of-mass energy only. This balancing of the stiﬀ dynamics is established by the ex-

istence of a quartic resonant constant that locks the dynamics to the neighborhood of the recoiling

circular orbit. The resonance condition quantizes the angular momenta in reasonable agreement

with the Bohr atom. The principal result is that the emission lines of quantum electrodynamics

(QED) agree with the prediction of our resonance condition within one percent average deviation.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we experiment with the stability analysis of the circular orbits of the electro-

magnetic two-body problem. The main motivation is to understand the complex dynamics

described by the electromagnetic equations of motion, that involve delay and third deriva-

tives. We give a method to derive the linearized equations of motion in the neighborhood

of the circular orbits of this implicitly-deﬁned dynamical system with delay. We introduce

an ad-hoc electromagnetic-like setting that uses advanced and retarded Li´enard-Wiechert

interactions plus the dissipative Lorentz-Dirac self-interaction force [1], henceforth called

the dissipative Fokker setting (DFS). We study in detail a speciﬁc feature of the tangent

dynamics of the circular orbits of the two-body problem; The stiﬀ normal modes of the

linearized dynamics, that have an arbitrarily large imaginary eigenvalue. Last, we discuss

an application for the hydrogen atom and the surprising predictions of stability analysis

within the DFS; We predict several features of the Bohr atom [2] with high precision and

qualitative detail. A subset of the emission lines predicted by the DFS agrees with the lines

of quantum electrodynamics (QED) within one percent average deviation. There is also a

surprising body of qualitative agreement with QED; (i) the emitted frequency is diﬀerent

from the orbital frequency, (ii) the stable orbits of the DFS have angular momenta that are

multiples of a basic angular momentum. This basic angular momentum of the DFS agrees

well with Planck’s constant and depends only logarithmically on the mass of the heavier

particle.

Dirac’s 1938 fundamental work [1] on the electrodynamics of point charges gave complex

and stiﬀ delay equations that were seldom studied. Among the few models studied within

Dirac’s theory, the system of Eliezer’s theorem [3–6] revealed a surprising dynamics; An

electron moving in a Coulomb ﬁeld with inclusion of self-interaction can never fall into the

center of force by radiating energy. The result was generalized to motions in arbitrary attrac-

tive potentials [4], as well as to tridimensional motions with self-interaction in a Coulomb

ﬁeld [5, 6], ﬁnding that only scattering states are possible. Since our model has Eliezer’s

problem as the inﬁnite-mass limit, a ﬁnite mass for the proton is essential for a physically

meaningful dynamics; If the proton has a ﬁnite mass, there is no inertial frame where it

rests at all times, and this in turn causes delay because of the ﬁnite speed of light. It is

widely known that QED gives a satisfactory and precise description of atomic physics, but

2

the same is not popularly thought about atomic models based on classical electrodynamics.

Since dynamical studies are still missing, clearly this complex dynamics needs to be investi-

gated beyond our preliminary ﬁndings. Even though we are not trying to replace QED, our

understanding of this two-body dynamics might prove useful for atomic physics and perhaps

we can understand QED as the eﬀective theory of this complex stiﬀ dynamics with delay.

We shall describe the two-body motion in terms of the familiar center-of-mass coordinates

and coordinates of relative separation, deﬁned as the familiar coordinate-transformation that

maps the two-body Kepler problem into the one-body problem with a reduced mass. We

stress that in the present relativistic motion the Cartesian center-of-mass vector is not ig-

norable, and it represents three extra coupled degrees-of-freedom. We introduce the concept

of resonant dissipation to exploit this coupling and the many solutions that a delay equation

can have. Resonant dissipation is the condition that both particles decelerate together, i.e.,

the center-of-mass vector decelerates, while the coordinates of relative separation perform an

almost-circular orbit, despite of the energy losses of the metastable center-of-mass dynamics.

Historically N¨ordstrom [7, 8] suggested the use of advanced and retarded potentials in

atomic physics already in 1920, but the self-interaction theory was problematic in 1920 and

the idea disappeared. The theory of nonlinear dynamics was not out yet in 1938 when

Dirac’s theory for the electrodynamics of point charges appeared [1], neither in the Glorious

days of the twentieth century physics [9], such that the our present experiment is a new

application of modern nonlinear dynamics. Advanced interactions appeared again in 1945,

when Wheeler and Feynman [10, 11] gave an electrodynamics based on the postulate that

every ﬁeld is produced by charges located somewhere [12]. The theory was called action-

at-a-distance electrodynamics [10, 11], a theory where the isolated two-body problem is

deﬁned by Fokker’s action

with xi , si, mi and ei representing the four-position, the proper time, the mass and the

charge of particles i = 1, 2 respectively. In Eq. (1) the dot indicates the Minkowski scalar

product of four-vectors and double bars stand for the four-vector modulus [10, 11]. Due

to the similarities with the equations of motion of the DFS, the dynamical studies of the

action-at-a-distance theory are relevant for the present work. For example, in the collision

of two electrons with equations of motion determined by Eq. (1), the solution is determined

3

by initial position and velocity only, as proved in Ref [13] (a Banach-to-Banach contraction

mapping proof for nonrunaway orbits). This suggests that we are dealing with a perfectly

causal and well-posed dynamical system dressed in unusual form [14]. Driver’s result [13]

suggests that a dynamics with advance and delay is well-posed in the same way. The DFS

presents exactly the same neutral-delay mathematical problem of any electromagnetic-like

model, as for example the problem with retarded-only ﬁelds of Refs.[15, 16]. Fokker’s action

of Eq. (1) is used here to derive the sector of the DFS equations of motion determined

by the semi-sum of Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds. Last, advanced interactions appeared again in

another work of Eliezer; a generalization of Dirac’s covariant subtraction of electromagnetic

inﬁnities[17]. The resulting generalized electromagnetic settings include the advanced inter-

actions naturally, and provide a testbed for future studies in electrodynamics [17]. Here we

shall keep to the DFS as a generic electromagnetic-like example.

The road map for this paper is as follows; In Section IV we give the main technical

part of the paper; We outline an economical method to derive the tangent dynamics of the

circular orbit based on a quadratic expansion of the implicit light-cone condition. In this

Section we also take the stiﬀ limit of the linear modes of the tangent dynamics. In Section

V we give an application to atomic physics, by discussing a necessary condition for the

state of resonant dissipation; This condition is heuristically expressed by a simple resonance

condition that predicts the correct atomic scales. The earlier sections are a prelude to

Section IV. In Appendix A we discuss how the DFS can be ﬁt into Dirac’s electrodynamics

of point charges. Section II is a review of the circular orbit solution, to be used in Section

IV and in Section V. In Section III we build familiarity with Fokker’s action of the action-

at-a-distance electrodynamics as a prelude to the quadratic expansions needed for the linear

stability analysis of Section IV. Last, in Appendix B we discuss the soft normal modes of

the tangent dynamics and in Section VI we put the conclusions and discussion.

II. THE CIRCULAR ORBIT SOLUTION

In this Section we review the circular-orbit solution of the isolated electromagnetic two-

body problem of the action-at-a-distance electrodynamics [18, 19], to be used as the un-

perturbed orbit. For the isolated electromagnetic two-body problem, the tangent dynamics

4

studied in the next section is straight Lyapunov stability analysis. In the DFS there is also a

very small force along the orbital plane of the circular orbit, such that a non-drifting circular

orbit is not a solution of the equations of motion. In the DFS the tangent dynamics is the

starting point of a perturbation scheme to impose that the resulting dynamics is a drifting

circular orbit (the state of resonant dissipation).

We use the index i = 1 for the electron and i = 2 for the proton, with masses m1 and

m2 respectively, as of Eq. (1). We henceforth use units where the speed of light is c = 1

and e1 =

e2 ≡ −
−

1 (the electronic charge). The circular orbit is illustrated in Fig. 1; A

motion of the two particles in concentric circles with the same constant angular speed and

along a diameter. This dynamics satisﬁes the time-symmetric problem of Fokker’s action

(1) because the symmetric contributions from future and past generate a resulting force

normal to the velocity of each particle [18, 19]. The details of

this relativistic orbit will

be given now; The constant angular velocity is indicated by Ω, the distance between the

particles in light-cone is rb and θ

Ωrb is the angle that one particle turns while the light

≡

emanating from the other particle reaches it (the light-cone time lag). The angle θ is the

natural independent parameter of this relativistic problem. Each particle travels a circular

orbit with radius and scalar velocity deﬁned by

and

for the electron and for the proton, respectively. The condition that the other particle turns

an angle θ during the light-cone time lag is [18]

1 + b2
b2

2 + 2b1b2 cos(θ) = 1,

and is henceforth called the unperturbed light-cone condition. In Appendix B we calculate

b1 and b2 in a power series of θ up to the fourth order. Last, because of the rotational

invariance of Fokker’s action, there is a conserved angular momentum perpendicular to the

(5)

where the units of lz are e2/c, just that we are using a unit system where e2 = c = 1

[18]. Equation (4) restricts b1 and b2 to be less than one such that for small values of θ

It is

of angular momentum times the orbital frequency is reminiscent of the formal maneuvers of

quantum mechanics.

III.

FOKKER’S ACTION

We use Fokker’s action in this work as a means to derive the sector of the DFS equations of

motion determined by the semi-sum of the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials. In the following we

discuss the Lagrangian formalism of Fokker’s action (1) as an introduction to our economical

method to obtain the tangent dynamics by expanding this action to quadratic order. The

delta-function of Fokker’s action (1) contains the retarded and the advanced light-cone

contributions, and it is convenient to separate those two parts by factoring the argument of

the delta function as

(t1 −

t2)2

r2
12 = [t1 −

−

t2 −

r12][t1 −

t2 + r12],

where r12 stands for the Cartesian distance between particle 1 at time t1 and particle 2 at

time t2 and each factor on the right-hand side of Eq. (6) is related to the advanced and the

retarded light-cones of particle 1 respectively. The delta-function of a product argument

is a sum of two delta-functions each multiplied by the respective Jacobian, such that the

interaction term of Fokker’s action (1) can be written as

forth stands for the Cartesian velocity of particle 2 at time t2. We henceforth use the dot to

indicate the scalar product of two Cartesian vectors, as already used in Eq. (7). Integration

of each term of Eq. (7) over t2 brings out another Jacobian factor and yields

respectively, and v2a and v2b stand for the velocity of particle 2 at the advanced and retarded

time t2 respectively. Equation (8) is the most useful form of Fokker’s interaction for our

purposes. Notice that each term of Eq. (8) can be cast in the form

where V and A are the Li´enard-Wiechert scalar potential and the Li´enard-Wiechert vector

potential respectively. We have introduced the quantity c =

±
(9) such that c = 1 represents the advanced interaction while c =

1 in the denominator of Eq.

1 represents the retarded

interaction. The quantities of particle 2 in Eq. (9) are to be evaluated at a time t2 deﬁned

implicitly by

±

t2 = t1 +

r12
c

,

where c =

1 describes the advanced and retarded light cones, respectively. Because of this

decomposition of Fokker’s interaction into V and A parts, we henceforth call Eq. (9) the

VA interaction. A derivation of the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials from Fokker’s action and

details such as the Darwin approximation are found in Ref.[20].

The stiﬀ limit is determined by the largest-order derivative appearing in the linearized

equations of motion of Appendix A. In this approximation, the contribution of the self-

interaction force to the linearized dynamics about a circular orbit is simply given by the

Abraham-Lorentz -Dirac force

In this Section we study the linear stability analysis of the circular orbits for displacements

perpendicular to the orbital plane, henceforth called the z-direction. We give an economical

method to obtain these equations of tangent dynamics by expanding the implicit light-cone

condition up to quadratic order. We start from the equations of motion of the isolated

system, which are derived from Fokker’s action (1) and yield the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds in

the half-retarded plus half-advanced combination. This linearized z dynamics is uncoupled

from the planar dynamics, and the linearized equations can de derived without the use of a

symbolic software, as we explain in the following. The Cartesian coordinates of a transversely

perturbed circular orbit are deﬁned by

b2 are deﬁned from the two real parameters of Eq. (2) and Ω is the

and

We henceforth introduce a scaled time τ

Ωt. The linear stability analysis involves

expanding the equations of motion to linear order in Zk , which in turn is determined

by the quadratic expansion of Fokker’s action in Zk. The main tool for expanding this

quadratic action is the perturbed light-cone condition, Eq. (10), about the circular orbit

(where r12 = rb is the constant circular lag). We introduce a function ϕ of the Z1 and Z2

perturbations by expanding the light-cone time t2 as

In the following we calculate this homogeneous functional ϕ of Z1 and Z2 up to quadratic

order. The distance r12 entering Eq. (10) is to be evaluated from the position of particle 1

at time t1, to the position of particle 2 at the time t2 deﬁned implicitly by Eq. (15). The

where c = 1 for the advanced time t2 and c =

1 for the retarded time t2. Notice that Eq.

−

(16) deﬁnes the coordinates implicitly, because ϕ is a function of the deviations Z1 and Z2.

Even though θ is small in applications of atomic physics, we stress that one should never

expand in powers of θ; the correct inﬁnitesimal quantity of the linear stability analysis is the

size of the deviations from circularity and their homogeneous functions such as ϕ (expanding

in θ produces the Darwin approximation [20]). This non-analyticity will become clear after

we show that the logarithm of θ appears. We therefore expand the advanced/retarded

position Z2c of particle 2 at the scaled time τ 1 + cθ + ϕ in a Taylor series in ϕ about the

advanced/retarded position τ 1 + cθ. It turns out that only the zeroth-order term appears

in the action up to quadratic order. Because of this, the linearized equations involve only a

constant shift, a considerable simpliﬁcation. Substituting t2 of Eq. (15) together with the

position (16) of particle 2 into Eq. (10) and using Pythagoras theorem for the distance r12

from particle 1 at time t1 to particle 2 at time t2 yields

Notice that the Z variations decouple from the planar variations because there is no mixed

linear term of Z times a linear perturbation of the planar coordinate in Eq. (17); These are

naturally separated by Pythagoras theorem. The planar perturbations enter in Eq. (17) as

an added quadratic form, as given in the next section. It is convenient to deﬁne another

function Φ by ϕ

where the equivalence sign

henceforth means equivalent up to a Gauge term of second

quadratic order it would still produce a Gauge and therefore it can be dropped directly from

the denominator. One should be careful not to do this with linear Gauges, which appear

only in the planar stability analysis to be considered elsewhere. In this way, the expansion

up to second order of the VA interaction of Eq. (9) is simply

V. THE STIFF STABILITY OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM

We are interested in ﬁnding motions where the particles recoil together while staying in

the neighborhood of a drifting circular orbit, i.e., the state of resonant dissipation. The

need for a resonance becomes obvious in the following perturbative scheme; (i) We take

the circular orbit as the unperturbed state.

(ii) We substitute the circular orbit plus a

perturbation into the equations of motion of the DFS and take the linearized equations of

motion. The circular orbit is not an exact solution of the DFS equations of motion, because

of the small forcing coming from the third derivatives. This perturbative scheme yields linear

delay equations with a small forcing term along the orbital plane. It is then possible to show

by averaging [26] that a weakly-accelerated drifting circular orbit is never a solution to these

linear equations. Therefore, a bifurcation of the circular orbit must happen and a nonlinear

12

term must be important to balance the small dissipative forcing, if the state of resonant

dissipation is to be attained. In the following we postulate that this resonance happens at

a quartic order. By inspection, one ﬁnds that only resonance conditions involving the stiﬀ

modes can be satisﬁed in the atomic magnitude. In the following we study the consequences

that along some special circular orbits such balancing mechanism is established by the

existence of a quartic resonant constant of motion. To discuss this stability by resonance

we need some results of the tangent dynamics along the orbital plane. This more elaborate

tangent dynamics is derived in a way analogous to Section V and shall be given elsewhere,

here we give only the main results. The stiﬀ-limit for the equal-mass two-body problem

with retarded and advanced ﬁelds is studied in Ref. [23], and in the following we give the

generalization of these results for the case of arbitrary masses.

Up to linear order, the tangent dynamics along the orbital plane is decoupled from the

z-dynamics of Section V. To study this planar tangent dynamics, it is convenient to describe

the orbit along the z = 0 plane using gyroscopic coordinates

where ηk and ξk are complex numbers deﬁning the perturbation of the circularity and the

dk are deﬁned below Eq. (12). Because xk and yk are real, we should have ηk = ξ

∗
k but a

convenient way to minimize the quadratic functional of Fokker’s action is to treat ηk and ξk

as independent functions. To ﬁx ideas we start from the stability of the isolated two-body

system, and again we deﬁne the normal-mode eigenvalue by λΩ/θ, i.e., every coordinate

perturbation oscillates in time as exp(λΩt/θ) ( λ is an arbitrary complex number). The

limiting form of the planar characteristic equation for the isolated diﬀerent-mass case is

where µ is the reduced mass and M

Eq. (37) reduces to Eq. (15) of Ref.

m1 + m2 (for the equal-mass case, our general

[23] ). Along circular orbits both the planar and

the perpendicular linearized equations share the same limiting characteristic Eq. (37), as

can be checked with Eq. (34). For hydrogen (µ/M) is a small factor of about (1/1824).

It is important to understand the structure of the roots of Eq.

(37) in the complex λ

plane, specially for θ of the order of the ﬁne structure constant. The very small parameter

where q is an arbitrary integer. The plus or minus sign of Eq.

(38) is related to the

time-reversibility of the isolated two-body system, a symmetry that is broken by radiation.

This same exact phenomenon happens for the z direction. Next we include the dissipation

of the DFS, i.e., the Lorentz-Dirac self-interaction, a calculation performed by adding the

self-interaction force to the equations of motion of the isolated system. Here we give only
the characteristic planar equation up to O(1/λ4)

It is remarkable that Eqs. (39) and (34) diﬀer only at the terms of O(1/λ) and at the terms
of type θ4λ2, which describe small corrections for σ in the atomic range. The linear term on

the right-hand side of Eqs. (34) and (39) with the 2/3 coeﬃcient is due to the self-interaction

force. This dissipative term breaks the time-reversal symmetry of Eq. (37), and the roots

of Eqs. (34) and (39) no longer come in plus or minus pairs. Let λxy be a root of Eq. (39)

with positive real part and λz be a root of Eq. (34) with a negative real part. In the stiﬀ

limit these are both near one of the limiting roots (38) and can be expressed as

λxy ≡
λz ≡ −

(σ + πqi + iǫ1),

(σ + πqi + iǫ2),

(40)

where the small perturbations ǫ1 and ǫ2 are so far two arbitrary complex numbers. The

second order balancing process studied here involves the interaction of a z mode with a

planar mode, in the same way used in Refs.

[15, 16]. This is because if the atom is to

recoil like a rigid body, one expects the fast dynamics to encircle the circular orbit with fast

spinning motions of balanced amplitude.

We henceforth assume heuristically that the state of resonant dissipation is formed in a

bifurcation involving perturbations along two special linear modes of the tangent dynamics.

We take a perpendicular normal mode of Eq. (34) and a planar normal mode of Eq. (39),

14

with eigenvalues λz and λxy respectively. The coordinate of the planar normal mode is

a linear combination of the four ηξ gyroscopic coordinates: u

a1kηk + b1kξk, while the

≡

b1z1 + b2z2. Using the normal mode
coordinate of the perpendicular z normal mode is Z
conditions θ ˙u = Ωλxyu and θ ˙Z = ΩλzZ one can show that the quadratic form uZ is a

complex amplitude that oscillates harmonically with the beat frequency (λxy + λz)Ω/θ =
i(ǫ1 −

ǫ2)Ω/θ. Our resonance condition is to choose these two eigenvalues such that

Re(λxy + λz) = 0.

(41)

Condition (41) avoids that the modulus of the amplitude uZ has an exponential growth. We

shall see that condition (41) is satisﬁed only for special discrete values of θ. Since condition

(41) must be satisﬁed, we henceforth assume that ǫ1 and ǫ2 are real numbers, as any excess

real part in Eq. (40) can be absorbed in the deﬁnition of σ. Condition (41) is also the

necessary condition to construct a resonant constant in the neighborhood of the circular

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In the limit where the proton has an inﬁnite mass, the concept of resonant dissipation

loses meaning because the center-of-mass coordinate no longer plays a dynamical role. In this

singular limit, there is a Lorentz frame where the proton rests at the origin at all times, and

the ﬁeld at the electron reduces to a simple Coulomb ﬁeld in the DFS. The two-body dynam-

ics in the DFS reduces then to the dynamical system of Eliezer’s theorem; self-interaction

plus a Coulomb ﬁeld acting on the electron [3, 4]. We repeat this correct dynamics because

it is very unpopular [3–6]; With inclusion of self-interaction, it is impossible for the electron

to ”spiral into the proton”. Neither bound states nor dives are possible, only scattering

states exist. This result is in surprising agreement with our formula (46) for the quantized

18

angular momenta; If the mass of the proton is set inﬁnite in Eq. (46), the quantized angu-

lar momenta become inﬁnite logarithmically, θ goes to zero, and the particles are unbound

at an inﬁnite distance! One accomplishment of the present work is to recognize that only

the two-body problem can produce a physically sensible electromagnetic-like model. Even

though there is a dependence on the mass in Eq. (46), the logarithm of the mass ratio times
θ4 makes the theory very insensitive to this mass ratio, such that the deuterium and the

muonium have essentially the same quantized angular momenta, in reasonable agreement

with QED. Qualitative disagreement would need an exponentially massive charged particle.

Fortunately to our present theory, such particle does not exist in nature.

Another qualitative dynamical picture is suggested by Eliezer’s result [3, 4]; The dynam-

ical phenomenon that the electron always turns away from the proton along unidimensional

orbits suggests that colinear orbits are the natural attractors of the dissipative dynam-

ics (a ground state with zero angular momentum!). Along such orbits, the heavy particle

(the proton) moves in a non-Coulombian way and the self-interaction provides the repul-

sive mechanism that avoids the collision at the origin. This is again in agreement with

the Schroedinger theory, where the ground state has a zero angular momentum. Again,

the inﬁnite-mass case produces unphysical dynamics; the electron turns away but then it

runs away [4].

It remains to be researched if the two-body case has a physical orbit for

zero-angular momentum orbits.

The theory of normal forms for delay equations is studied in Ref.

[27]. An analogous

mathematical phenomenon is the ﬁnite-dimensional center-manifold for equations with ad-

vance and delay studied in connection with discrete shocks in the conservation laws of Refs.

[28, 29]. These conservation laws are similar to Dirac’s relativistic Schroedinger’s equation,

and this would be a natural bridge to QED. Detailed construction of the resonant normal

form is also needed to discuss the width of the emission lines. In the dynamical process of

resonant exchange, the sharp line is emitted while the dynamics is locked to the neighbor-

hood of the resonant orbit, which according to QED is a life-time of about 106 turns in the
hydrogen atom (10−9 seconds). We conjecture that when the metastable orbit breaks down,

the dynamics falls into the next metastable attracting orbit; another circular orbit, or into

the ground state [26].

The stiﬀ modes of Eq. (40) introduce a fast (stiﬀ) time-scale with a frequency of the

order of σ/θ

1400 times the orbital frequency, such that the time for a stiﬀ jump of the

≃

19

1

dynamics is

1400 times the orbital period, or 10−18 seconds! After this fast timescale the
resonance essentially locks the dynamics to the neighborhood of the metastable resonant

orbit. The fact that the equations of electrodynamics describe stiﬀ jumps in the phase

space is largely unexplored in the light of modern applied mathematics; mainly due to the

complexity involved. The dynamics starting from an asymptotic resonant orbit to another of

a neighboring q is certainly described by a stiﬀ jump, as expected generically from any stiﬀ

equation. In Ref [25], the much simpler Van der Pol oscillator is worked out in detail as an

example of an equation of Lienard type that exhibits stiﬀ jumps. In quantum mechanics one

seems to need the problematic concept of an ”instantaneous quantum jump”, to describe the

stiﬀ passage from one quantum state to another. It appears that classical electrodynamics

prescribes exactly this qualitative phenomenon; a quasi-instantaneous fast dynamics.

The dynamics in the DFS solves several conundrums of the classical hydrogen atom and

is similar to QED in many ways; (i) the radiated frequency is not equal to the orbital

frequency ( it is lesser than the orbital frequency, see Table 1). (ii) the resonant orbits are

naturally quantized by integers and the radiated frequencies agree with the Bohr circular

lines within one percent average deviation. (iii) The ratio of the emitted frequency to the

orbital frequency is in reasonable agreement with QED. (iv) the angular momenta of the

resonant orbits are naturally quantized with the correct Planck’s constant. (v) the stability

analysis uses a linear dynamical system with delay, a dynamical system that needs an initial

function as the initial condition, just like Schroedinger’s equation. The emitted frequencies

are then given by a diﬀerence of two eigenvalues of this linear operator, like the Rydberg-

Ritz combinatorial principle of quantum physics. (vi) The eigenvalues of our linear operator

have a large magnitude that does not appear in the frequency. This large magnitude is given

by a logarithm, just like in the divergent perturbation theory for the Lamb-shift of QED.

Recognizing the correct qualitative dynamics with the concept of resonant dissipation has

taken us very far; the stability analysis indicated the need for resonances, and these turned

out to be satisﬁed only for the stiﬀ modes and precisely in the atomic magnitude! The stiﬀ

modes also provide a natural integer to label the resonant orbits. We selected the values

of q among the larger set predicted by the necessary condition (41), showing that Eq. (41)

is not in disagreement with QED. A suﬃcient condition should be part of the extra work

to understand the unfolding of the bifurcation leading to the state of resonant dissipation.

The large body of qualitative and quantitative agreement suggests that an extensive study

20

of electromagnetic-like models [17], of which the DFS is only a generic example, could oﬀer

an explanation of QED in terms of a stiﬀ dynamical system with third derivatives and delay.

VIII. APPENDIX A: PHYSICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE DFS

In Dirac’s theory [1] the self-interaction is given by the sourceless combination of half of

the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert self-potential minus half of the advanced Li´enard-Wiechert

self-potential, i.e., the semi-diﬀerence [1]. This gives the following concise description of

the DFS; Charges interact with themselves via the semi-diﬀerence of Li´enard-Wiechert self-

potentials and with other charges via the semi-sum of Li´enard-Wiechert potentials. In the

following we try to ﬁt our ad-hoc DFS into Dirac’s theory as an eﬀect of the physical

boundaries on the ﬁelds. Dirac’s electrodynamics of point charges [1] uses the retarded

potential F ν

µk,ret produced by each particle k and an incident free ﬁeld F ν

µ,in.

In Dirac’s

theory the electron and the proton of a hydrogen atom have the following equations of

where the ﬁeld of each particle is to be evaluated along the trajectory of the other particle, as

indicated by the parenthesis after each ﬁeld. Since both the advanced and the retarded ﬁelds

satisfy Maxwell’s equations, the semi-diﬀerence is a free ﬁeld, as assumed. The incident wave

can be generated by the boundary conditions on the ﬁelds. For example, the reﬂections of the

radiation by other atoms of a diluted gas could play the role of such a boundary condition.

The semi-diﬀerence evaluated at the particle itself is the familiar self-interaction of the

Dirac theory [1], and Eqs. (52) and (53) have instead the semi-diﬀerence evaluated at the

position of the other particle. Using the Page expansion of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds, we

ﬁnd that the electric ﬁeld of this semi-diﬀerence is approximated by the third derivative of

the other particle’s coordinate, as discussed in Refs.

[15, 16]. In this approximation with

the Page series [15, 16], the incident electric ﬁeld evaluated at the proton, Eq.(53), is

E(x2(t))

...
x 1.

(54)

Along the unperturbed orbit of Fig.1, Eq. (54) is an electromagnetic ﬁeld rotating at the

orbital frequency. For orbits in the atomic magnitude the electric ﬁeld of Eq. (54) has an

intensity that turns out to be of the order of the polarized vacuum of QED, as discussed in

Ref.[31]. This shows that our needed homogeneous ﬁeld has the correct physical magnitude

of the QED vacuum polarized by the hydrogen atom. We see that the ad-hoc DFS demands

a free ﬁeld produced by the boundaries that is calculated to have a physically sensible order

of magnitude. This approach to justify the DFS with a free ﬁeld produced by the boundaries

is similar to that of the stochastic electrodynamics of Refs. [32, 33].

Finally, we mention a more radical alternative to justify our ad-hoc DFS, by generalizing

Dirac’s theory such that the DFS would be derived from principle. This approach was taken

by Eliezer and this generalization, henceforth called the Eliezer’s setting (ES), is discussed

in the excellent review of Ref.

[17]. The ES involves the advanced interactions naturally,

exactly in the same form of the DFS! Better still; the ES [17] contains an arbitrary parameter,

and it would be highly desirable to experiment with stability analysis and the concept of

resonant dissipation in the ES [17]. Even though the ES involves delay, advance and third

derivatives exactly like the DFS, the coeﬃcients in the ES are never equal to those of the

DFS. Our preliminary ﬁndings with the DFS suggest a future for this enterprise in the

qualitative behavior of electromagnetic-like dynamics, one that could describe QED by a

IX. APPENDIX B: DARWIN AND THE SOFT COULOMBIAN MODES

In this appendix we calculate b1 and b2 of Eq. (2) as a function of m1, m2 and θ. The

radial component of the electron’s equation of motion along the circular orbit is [18]

where C and S are deﬁned in Eqs. (13) and (14) respectively. Our Eq. (55) is Eq. (3.2) of

The radial equation for the proton is obtained by exchanging the subindices 1 and 2 in Eq.

(55). There are three equations involving b1, b2 , θ and rb; (i) Eq. (55), (ii) the equation

for the proton, obtained by exchanging indices 1 and 2 in Eq. (55), and (iii) the light-cone

condition, Eq. (4)

For small values of θ (atomic physics), we can solve Eqs. (57) in a power series of θ with a

symbolic manipulation software, yielding

b1 =

(1 +

It is easy to continue this power series, but for the stiﬀ limit in the atomic magnitude, even
the θ2 correction already gives a very small correction. The orbital frequency is determined

the ﬁrst term is Kepler’s third law if we use θ = Ωrb, and the next term is the Darwin

correction. More information about the isolated two-body problem can be found in Refs.

[21, 23].

As an application of the above expansion, we calculate the soft Coulombian modes of Eq.

(31) at a ﬁnite p by expanding up to O(θ3) :

det Z =

p2(1 + p2)[1

The soft roots of det Z = 0 for Eq.

(61) are the Galilean translation mode p = 0 (a

double root) and the oscillatory solutions p

that have a real part describing the

i
≃ ±

radiative damping of the DFS, a familiar feature. We had partial success describing the

atomic dynamics of helium with the Darwin approximation [30], and the tools of stability

analysis used here were already used in Refs. [15, 16]. The concept of resonant dissipation

is new, and it is a generalization of the concept of a non-ionizing dynamics of Ref.[30].

Unfortunately, the theory of Refs. [15, 16, 30] fails to describe discrete states for hydrogen

because the soft Darwin modes are neutrally stable. As we have seen here, it is the stiﬀ

modes that equilibrate the dynamics, and those are beyond the Darwin approximation.

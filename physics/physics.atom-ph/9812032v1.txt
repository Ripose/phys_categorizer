1 Introduction

In stationary perturbation theory as well as in the time-dependent one, the
method of using the Coulomb Green function has found wide application in
obtaining analytical solutions of the Schr¨odinger or Dirac equations. The
main advantage of this method is the possibility of obtaining the ﬁnal results
in closed analytical form or reducing results to the summation of rapidly
convergent series. Therefore, by using the above-mentioned method one can
avoid a lot of complex numerical integrations (see, for example, Makhan¨ek
and Korol’kov 1982, Zapryagaev et al 1985 and references cited therein). On
the basis of the application of the connection between the problem of the
four-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator and that of a hydrogen-like
atom in eletromagnetic ﬁelds (see Kustaanheimo and Stiefel 1965), it has
been proposed to establish a new representation of the Coulomb Green func-
tion in the form of a product of annihilation and creation operators (this
is called by us an operator representation). Operator representation of the
Coulomb Green function is very eﬃcient in application for the non-relativistic
case (Le Van Hoang et al 1989) as well as for the relativistic one (Le Anh
Thu et al 1994). The main elements of the algebraic method used (with
the aid of the operator representation of the Coulomb Green functions) in
Le Van Hoang et al (1989) and in Le Anh Thu et al (1994) are as follows.
By using the above-mentioned connection, all operators of the algebra of
the dynamical symmetry group SO(4, 2) can be found in the quadratic form
of the annihilation and creation operators (see, for example, Kleinert 1968,
Komarov and Romanova 1982). Therefore, the calculation method, based
on the use of the algebra of SO(4, 2), leads only to the use of the simple
communtaion relations between the latter operators. The use of this method
together with the operator representation of the Coulomb Green function
essentially reduces the calculation process and provides for reducing rather
complicated calculations of matrix elements with the Coulomb wavefunc-
tions to a purely algebraic procedure of transforming the product of the
annihilation and creation operators to the normal form. The advantage of
the proposed algebraic method are found not only in the simplicity of the
calculation process but also in the possibility of obtaining the ﬁnal results
in the summation of rapidly convergent series. In fact, some clever results
are obtained in Le Anh Thu et al (1994) for the problem of calculation of
the relativistic polarizability of hydrogen-like atoms. In this present paper,

2

we consider the problem of calculating the relativistic dynamical polarizabil-
ity of the ground state of hydrogen-like atoms on the basis of application
of the operator representation of the Dirac Coulomb Green function estab-
lished in Le Anh Thu et al 1994. These calculations, besides their purely
theoretical signiﬁcance, are of great practical interest connected with recent
developments in experimental investigations of multiply charged ions (see,
for example, Zapryagaev et al 1985, Paratzacos and Mork 1979). However,
the majority of accurate calculations has been done only for the static po-
larizability of relativistic hydrogen-like atoms (see also Drake and Goldman
1981, 1988, Johnson et al 1988). In our calculations the radiation corrections
are neglected, taking into account the fact that this eﬀect is small compared
with the external ﬁeld eﬀect. Our results are directly generalized from the
non-relativistic calculations (Zapryagaev et al 1985) and coincide with the
results in the static limit (Le Anh Thu et al 1994).

We will solve equation (1) by using the method of perturbation theory
assuming the external electric ﬁeld to be small. Its solution can be found in
the form

Ψ(0)(r) e−iε0t + θu(r) e−it(ε0−ν) + θv(r) e−it(ε0+ν),

After expanding the functions

of operators ˆL2 and ˆκ, the operator ˆκ appearing in (12) and (13) becomes
a c-number and, therefore, in order to solve equations (12) and (13) we can
employ the Green function method established in Le Anh Thu et al (1994).
In the next section we will show an example by calculating the dynamical
polarizability of hydrogen-like atoms in the ground state.

ground state of hydrogen-like atoms

Solution of equation (5) can be easily obtained by purely algebraic calcu-
lations.
In particular, we can ﬁnd for the ground state the solution (see

As mentioned above (see (2)), all operators in (20), (21) (though formally
written for brevity via the usual coordinates xλ (λ = 1, 2, 3)) are understood
in the sence of the formal changes (2). These changes are equivalent to the
transformation from r-space to ξ-space (Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transforma-
tion, see Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (1965)):

So we can rewrite the operators used in (20), (21) via the annihilation and
creation operators as follows

Here, we note that the Green function operator (23) acts on the basis of
states with frequency ω. However, the wavefunctions in the zero-order ap-
proximation (15) have the frequency ω0 = Ze2. Therefore, in order to use
the algebraic calculation we have to transform the wavefunctions (15) from
the frequency ω0 to ω using the unitary transformation (see Komarov and

Direct calculations show that all power series appearing in the term H κ
nm
are rapidly convergent. The high convergency of these power series is di-
rectly related to the expansion (23) of the Dirac Coulomb Green function
which, in fact, is established on the basis of harmonic oscillator wavefunc-
tions. Moreover, the expression (28) for the polarizability contains only H κ
nm
with n, m = 0, 1, the calculation of which needs only some ﬁrst terms in the
summation over p. For example, for frequency ν less than the fourth reso-
nance frequency (relative to the transition from ground state to 3P3/2 state)
the contribution of the terms with p = 0, 1 in H κ
nm (n, m = 0, 1) is about
98 %–99 % for all Z
137.

In ﬁgures 1(a)and 1(b) the dependence of relativistic polarizability on the
external ﬁeld frequency is given for hydrogen-like atoms with Z = 50. The
dotted lines correspond to the non-relativistic limit case. Figure 2 give the
same for Z = 100.

Let us now consider the non-relativistic limit, i.e. take into account only
the ﬁrst term in the expansion in the power series of Ze2. For this case, we
can eﬀect summation over the variables t, q, s in the expression of H κ
nm and
then have H κ
nm in the form of hypergeometric functions. Consequently, we
have

By putting ν = 0 into (28), (30) and (31) we thus ﬁnd the formula for the
relativistic polarizability. It is easy to see that for ω = ω0 the formula (28)
contains only the term H κ

4 Conclusion

In conclusion we would like to note that the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects, as a rule,
should be taken into account for a detailed investigation of the behavior of
a relativistic atom in the ﬁeld of linearly polarized light. These eﬀects can
be neglected only in the non-relativistic limit. The above method proposed
with the use of the operator representation of the Coulomb Green function
can also be employed, for example, in calculating magnetic polarizability.
Consideration of magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects leads only to an enormous number
of calculations, which are more complicated in comparison with the above
calculations but could be done analogously by analytical methods. Moreover,
we hope that our algebraic method would be helpful when considering the
problem of an atom in a quantum ﬁeld, in particular in calculating the Lamb
shift of multiply charged ions, which is of great interest and has been widely
investigated recently (see, for example, Snyderman 1991).

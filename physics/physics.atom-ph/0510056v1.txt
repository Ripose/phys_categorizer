Abstract

Formulas for the corrections to the energy levels and wave functions of a spin-zero particle

bound in a strong ﬁeld are derived. General case of the sum of a Lorentz-scalar potential and zero

component of a Lorentz-vector potential is considered. The forms of the corrections diﬀer essentially

from those for spin-1/2 particles. As an example of application of our results, we evaluated the

electric polarizability of a ground state of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

As known, in many cases the perturbation theory (PT) is a very fruitful method to obtain

analytic results for various corrections. The formulas of PT for the Dirac equation are

similar to that for the Schr¨odinger equation and have simple forms (see, e.g. [1]). However,

it is essentially more complicated to derive the formulas of PT for the Klein-Gordon-Fock

equation, because this equation contains second derivative over time. In the present paper,

we derive the ﬁrst and the second order corrections to the energy levels, and the ﬁrst order

correction to the wave function of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong ﬁeld. We consider

a general case of a sum of the Lorentz-scalar and the Lorentz-vector potentials. This may

be useful at the consideration of the eﬀects of the strong interaction in pionic atoms. Using

our formula for the correction to the energy level, we evaluate the electric polarizability of

a ground state of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld.

Then we represent the potentials in the form V (r) = V0(r)+δV (r), and U(r) = U0(r)+δU(r).

Let φn(r) be the solution of the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation in the potentials V0(r), U0(r)

with the corresponding energy εn. Let us write

Φn(r) = φn(r) + δφn(r)

III. ELECTRIC POLARIZABILITY

As an application of our results, let us consider the electric polarizability α1s of a ground

state of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld. For spin-1/2 particle the

polarizability was obtained in Ref.[3, 4].

For the perturbation δU(r) =

nuclear size. Besides, in a pionic atom it is necessary to account for the eﬀects of the

strong interaction that become dominant for the ground state at large Z . It is interesting

to compare the polarizabilities of a ground state, calculated for spin-0 particle and spin-
1/2 particle. It turns out that the functions f (Z) = Z 4α1s obey the relation f (Z)S=0 ≈
f (2Z)S=1/2 with accuracy of a few percent.

In summary, we have derived the formulas for the corrections to the energy levels and

wave functions of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong ﬁeld. These formulas may be useful

at the consideration of various eﬀects in pionic atoms. As an example, we evaluated the

electric polarizability of a ground state of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong Coulomb

ﬁeld.

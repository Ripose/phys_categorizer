Abstract. An analytical microscopic theory for the resonant multiple scattering
of light by cold atoms with arbitrary internal degeneracy is presented.
It

photon states of the full transverse electromagnetic ﬁeld in a dilute medium

the ladder and maximally crossed diagrams, giving the average intensity in the
Boltzmann approximation and the interference corrections responsible for weak
localization and coherent backscattering. The exact decomposition into ﬁeld
modes shows that the atomic internal degeneracy contributes to the depolarization
of the average intensity and suppresses the interference corrections. Static as
well as dynamic quantities like the transport velocity, diﬀusion constants and
relaxation times for all ﬁeld modes and all atomic transitions are derived.

1. Introduction

Wave propagation in disordered media has been an active ﬁeld of research for more
than a century. The ﬁrst descriptions of electronic conduction in weakly disordered
metals by Drude [1] and of light propagation in interstellar clouds by Schuster [2] were
based on Boltzmann-type transport equations. Despite their successful predictions
(e.g. Ohm’s law), these theories overlooked the subtle role of interference. P. Anderson
ﬁrst showed that suﬃciently strong disorder can induce a metal-insulator transition
for quantum-mechanical wave functions on a random lattice, a phenomenon baptized
Anderson localization [3]. Furthermore, it was realized that interference inﬂuences
transport even far from the localization transition and that also other waves are
concerned. For example, the constructive interference of counter-propagating light
amplitudes in the backward direction, as ﬁrst pointed out by Watson [4], survives
an average over disorder, giving rise to the coherent backscattering (CBS) peak
[5, 6, 7]. In the past 20 years, the ﬁeld of mesoscopic physics has developed, with
beautiful experimental and theoretical results pertaining to the weak localization
regime [8, 9, 10].

Atoms, as natural realizations of highly resonant identical point scatterers, have
been proposed as an ideal sample for multiple light scattering and even localization
[11, 12]. However, as ﬁrst discovered in experiments on CBS by rubidium atoms [13, 14]

Multiple scattering of light by atoms with internal degeneracy

and recently conﬁrmed on strontium atoms [15], the quantum internal structure of
atomic scatterers has a strong impact on light transport properties. The Zeeman
degeneracy of the probed dipole transition reduces the interference contrast of coherent
backscattering [16] dramatically. The single and double scattering contribution to the
CBS peak for atoms with arbitrary internal degeneracy have been calculated in [17].
In the present contribution, we develop an analytical theory of multiple resonant
one-photon elastic scattering in an inﬁnite medium consisting of a dilute gas of
cold atoms at ﬁxed classical positions, but with arbitrary internal degeneracy. Our
results are a ﬁrst step towards a microscopic generalization of the existing theories
for the scattering of transverse vector waves by Rayleigh point scatterers [18, 19]
on the one hand and of scalar waves by anisotropic scatterers [20, 21] on the other.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we deﬁne the Hamiltonian for the
coupled system light and atoms. In section 3, we calculate the average propagator
of a one-photon Fock state inside the scattering medium with the aid of the Dyson
equation and the photon self-energy.
In section 4, we deﬁne the average intensity
for the full vector ﬁeld in terms of photo-detection probability. The corresponding
Bethe-Salpeter equation is then solved by evaluating the so-called irreducible vertex
in the Boltzmann approximation. Technically, this is achieved by a systematic
analysis in terms of irreducible tensor operators. In section 5, we sum the so-called
ladder series in the static limit by applying the same method of irreducible tensors
to the intensity propagator of transverse ﬁeld modes. The interference correction
described by the maximally crossed diagrams is then easily obtained by applying
substitution rules. In section 6, we generalize our results to the dynamic case and
derive analytical expressions for transport velocities, diﬀusion constants, extinction
lengths and relaxation times for the diﬀerent ﬁeld modes and all atomic transitions.
We conclude by possible extensions of the work.

2. Description of the system

2.1. Hamiltonian

In order to analyze the role of the atomic quantum internal structure, we must treat the
atomic internal degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. For reasons of symmetry,
the light ﬁeld is treated quantum mechanically as well. Using natural units such that
~ = c = 1, the global system “matter + light” is then described by the Hamiltonian
H = H0 + V where

H0 = Hem + Hat =

Hem is the Hamiltonian of the free electromagnetic ﬁeld. The annihilation and
creation operators for the ﬁeld modes (wave vector k, transverse polarization ε, free
dispersion relation ωk = k) obey the usual bosonic commutation relation [akε, a†
k′ε′ ] =
δε,ε′ δk,k′ . For brevity, a one-photon Fock state will be noted

2.2. Length scales hierarchy

The detailed description of wave propagation in a large sample of scatterers at
quenched random positions is such a formidable task that one rather resorts to a
statistical description, catching the generic features through conﬁguration averaged
quantities (average amplitude, average intensity, etc) [23, 24, 25]. In the following,
we will consider the limit of a disordered inﬁnite medium where resonant point
scatterers are distributed with constant spatial density n. The absence of boundaries
greatly simpliﬁes the theory since translational symmetry is restored on average. The
importance of interference depends essentially on the hierarchy between the physically
relevant length scales in the system, here the wave length λ and the mean inter-particle
distance n−1/3. We will concentrate on the low density regime where λ
n−1/3. This
inequality, alternatively rewritten as nλ3
1, justiﬁes a semi-classical description of

propagation along rays between consecutive scatterers that deﬁne scattering paths

and their associated amplitudes.
It also implies that scattering paths involving
diﬀerent scatterers are uncorrelated : since their phase diﬀerence greatly exceeds 2π,
the associated interference term can be expected to average to zero. Also, recurrent
scattering sequences (visiting a given scatterer more than once) can be neglected:
this is the independent scattering approximation (ISA) [23].
In this dilute regime,
the elastic mean free path (mean distance traveled between two successive scattering
events) is given by ℓ = 1/nσ where σ is the total cross-section for elastic scattering.

The right hand side features the contributions of free evolution, single scattering,

(not shown), this average contains second- and higher-order moments of one-atom
scattering operators, arising from recurrent scattering by the same scatterer. As usual
in diagrammatic expansions [24], one introduces an operator representing the sum of
irreducible contributions, the self-energy.

The Dyson equation actually deﬁnes the self-energy Σ(z) whose exact calculation
remains impossible in most cases. Nevertheless, introducing the self-energy has two
major advantages: First, any approximate expression for the self-energy will yield an
approximate, but non-perturbative result for the average propagator (16). Second,
the perturbative expansion of the self-energy in a power series and its truncation
are controlled by the small parameter nλ3. The self-energy contains precisely all
irreducible diagrams, i.e. those that cannot be separated into independent diagrams

exponentially damped on average with a scattering mean free path ℓ = τ (remember

initially empty ﬁeld states. At low densities, and by virtue of the optical theorem, the

In all of the above expressions, only a modest dependence on J and Je arises through
the multiplicity ratio MJ . Obviously, the quantum internal structure has almost no
impact on the average amplitude: under an average over the scalar density matrix (9),
only the scalar part or trace of the t-matrix (8) can survive. We are left with a scalar
theory for the average amplitude, describable in terms of the polarizability alone. But
one should not conclude prematurely that the internal structure has no impact on the
average intensity which, of course, must be carefully distinguished from the square of
the average amplitude.

4. Average light intensity

In order to determine the average population of initially empty ﬁeld modes, we now
turn to the average intensity, deﬁned in terms of photo-detection probability.

4.1. Intensity propagation kernel

Since the total Hamiltonian H = H0 + V is time-independent, the density matrix ρ
of the coupled system “atoms + ﬁeld” evolves according to ρ(t) = U (t)ρ U †(t) where

In general, this equation cannot be solved exactly, and the irreducible vertex U (ω, Ω)

that of Σ(ω) since, physically speaking, the depletion of in initial state is caused by
scattering into initially empty ﬁeld modes. Mathematically, this consistency is assured
order by order in perturbation theory by a Ward identity [30].

This is the so-called Boltzmann approximation (or ﬁrst-order smoothing approxima-

for the self-energy since the corresponding Ward identity reduces to the optical theo-
rem (22) for Ω = 0 [23]. The Bethe-Salpeter equation (32) then acquires by iteration

4.4. Weak localization corrections

Finding among all possible diagrams the dominant interference corrections to the
Boltzmann approximation proves to be a delicate subject [31]. Langer and Neal
[32] introduced the so-called maximally crossed diagrams yielding an interference
correction to the ladder terms independently of the density of scatterers:

These diagrams describe amplitudes that propagate along the same scattering paths
but in opposite directions. Their interference is responsible for the weak localization
corrections to the conductivity of electrons in weakly disordered mesoscopic systems
U (1)(ω, Ω) + C(ω, Ω)
[8] and can be implemented self-consistently through U (ω, Ω)
[30]. This interference also gives rise to the coherent backscattering peak scattered

≈

Multiple scattering of light by atoms with internal degeneracy

from a bounded medium [6]. There, the interference correction is calculated using the
heuristic prescription R(ω, Ω)
L(ω, Ω) + C(ω, Ω). In sections 5 and 6, the full ladder
and crossed contributions will be calculated, preparing the ground for the calculation
of the CBS peak and weak localization corrections.

≈

The survival of an interference term despite an average over random realizations
may seem miraculous at ﬁrst glance. Closer analysis reveals that it is really due to
the fundamental symmetry of time reversal invariance. Let us brieﬂy recall the exact
relation between ladder and crossed diagrams. Take the ﬁrst non-trivial term of the

The ﬁrst substitution rule (46a), well known in the case of scalar wave scattering,
implies that the crossed and ladder terms are equal for scattering of plane waves
(k1 = k4 = k, k2 = k3 = k′ such that q = 0) in the backwards direction k′ =
k
since then also qC = k + k′ = 0. The second substitution rule (46b), known for
vector waves, restricts the equality to the channels of preserved helicity or parallel
linear polarization where ¯ε′ = ε. If these two conditions in the case of isotropic point
scatterers are satisﬁed, then the reciprocity theorem, stemming from time-reversal
invariance, indeed justiﬁes the equality of ladder and crossed series. Symbolically,
the crossed diagram can be disentangled by turning around its lower line and becomes
topologically a ladder diagram [34]. The third substitution rule (46c) is new and arises
because of the scatterers’ internal structure: by turning around the lower amplitude
according to the two previous rules, the atomic internal vertices (39) are twisted.

calculate diagrams of arbitrary scattering order using the above prescriptions. A
diﬀusive transport for the intensity, however, only emerges in the limit where all
ladder diagrams are summed up.

5. Summation of ladder and crossed series

Waves can be either scalar or vectorial, and point scatterers can be either isotropic
or anisotropic. This distinction deﬁnes four classes of multiple scattering theories
with growing complexity. The ﬁrst case of scalar waves and isotropic point scatterers
can be considered well understood [25, 27]. The case of scalar waves and anisotropic
point scatterers has been solved in the framework of the radiative transfer theory [20].
The multiple scattering of electromagnetic vector waves by point dipole scatterers,
from the ﬁrst approaches based on the diﬀusion approximation [6, 35, 36] up to
the exact solution of the radiative transfer equation by the Wiener-Hopf method
[18, 19], has kept a somewhat discouraging appearance.
Indeed, for a vector wave
like light, polarization and direction are linked by transversality. In order to describe
the evolution of the light intensity in three dimensions, one needs to manipulate tensors
of rank four or 9
9 transfer matrices. The strategy employed in the literature consists
in applying the scalar methods to this transfer matrix, which needs to be diagonalized
in an appropriate way. The published results demonstrate the diﬃculty of the problem
and the complexity of its solution.

×

A solution for the most diﬃcult case of vector waves and arbitrary scatterers is
still lacking to our knowledge. But the scattering of light by atoms with a quantum
internal structure falls precisely into this last class of diﬃculties since the internal
structure couples to the polarization and the isotropic dipole approximation J = 0
is forbidden by deﬁnition. In a previous work [17], we have been able to obtain the
) for arbitrary internal degeneracy J > 0 by a systematic
atomic intensity vertex
analysis in terms of irreducible operators with respect to the rotation group.
It is
therefore natural to apply the same powerful tool in order to simplify the summation
of the multiple scattering series as much as possible. In this section, we will consider
the static case Ω = 0, postponing the discussion of dynamic eﬀects to section 6.

5.1. Strategy of summation

Let us ﬁrst recall the solution for the case of scalar waves. This case can be viewed
as a limit of the full vector case by averaging over the incident polarization ε, and

6

summing over all ﬁnal directions k′ and polarizations ε′. The irreducible vertex (40)
then becomes the scalar factor u0 = πnσ/L3ω2, and the ladder series (34) sums up to

We see that the eigenvalues λK ∈
[0, 1] determine how faithfully the irreducible
component [ε1 ¯ε4](K) of incident ﬁeld polarizations is mapped on average to [¯ε2ε3](K).
An eigenvalue λK = 1 means perfect mapping, an eigenvalue λK = 0 means total
extinction. Note that the scalar eigenvalue is identically λ0 = 1 for all J, Je. The
scalar ﬁeld mode being the intensity, this sum rule reﬂects the conservation of energy.
The explicit dependence of eigenvalues on the ground-state angular momentum J is
given in table 2 on page 15 and displayed in ﬁgure 2 on page 17. In the case of the
isotropic point scatterer (J = 0, Je = 1) all eigenvalues saturate, λK = 1, as expected
for the identity operator (59). For J > 0, the non-scalar eigenvalues lie below unity,
λ1,2 < 1. This is consistent with the physical intuition that an initially well-polarized
light beam will be depolarized by so-called degenerate Raman transitions between
diﬀerent Zeeman-sublevels

ladder and crossed eigenvalues coincide trivially λK = χK = 1. But contrary to the
ladder case, the crossed scalar eigenvalue χ0 is not ﬁxed by any conservation law. It
indeed deviates from unity, χ0 < 1, as soon as J > 0, signifying a loss of contrast
for interference corrections to the Boltzmann intensity. In the limit Je = J

crossed and ladder eigenvalues take pairwise equal limits, signifying a perfect contrast
of interference, but non-negligeable depolarization as from a classical, anisotropic
scatterer (think of a small oriented antenna). A negative crossed eigenvalue, e.g.

From a conceptual point of view, the expressions (65) and (68) of the atomic vertex
eigenvalues in terms of 3nj-symbols are fully satisfying since we have reached their
most concise, truely irreducible formulation.



The direct product of two polarization vectors has nine independent components.
The atomic scattering vertices therefore can be represented by 9
9 transfer matrices
whose eigenvalues are λK and χK. Since the atomic scattering vertices are averages
over a scalar density matrix and therefore invariant under rotations, these eigenvalues
are (2K + 1)-times degenerate (corresponding to the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition
of the direct product of representations of dimension 3
3 = 1 + 3 + 5). Introducing
the irreducible components greatly simpliﬁes a problem that at ﬁrst glance deﬁed
an analytical treatment. It is thus natural to apply this strategy to the problem of
transverse propagation as well.

The (2K + 1)-degenerate eigenvalues at the origin, gKα(0), have been used by
Akkermans et al. [6] in a qualitative evaluation of polarization eﬀects on the coherent
backscattering peak, based on the diﬀusion approximation for scalar waves. The
expressions at order p2 (with a small error for the coeﬃcient of g20) have been found
by Stephen and Cwilich [35, (7.4)–(4.9)] and MacKintosh and John [36, (4.16)]. The
gKα(p), are identical to those found by Ozrin [18,
above functions, noted λi(p) = 1
(3.16)]. In a slightly modiﬁed form, they appear also in the radiative transfer theory
solved exactly by Amic, Luc and Nieuwenhuizen [19, (3.8),(3.15)]. But these last
approaches do not make use of an explicit analysis in terms of irreducible components,

The message of this expression is clear: in order to generalize the multiple scattering
of light to atoms, it suﬃces to multiply the vector eigenfunctions gKα(p) by the
corresponding atomic eigenvalue λK (J, Je) — a rather trivial prescription once the
meaning of the word “corresponding” has been clariﬁed (which constitutes the main
achievement of the present theory).

6. Transport velocity, diﬀusion constant and relaxation times

Let us now turn to the discussion of dynamic quantities like the transport velocity and
the diﬀusion constant for the diﬀerent ﬁeld modes. In the dynamic setting Ω
= 0, the
atomic ladder and crossed vertices (61) and (66) remain unchanged. Indeed, the only
dependence on frequency had been factorized in the prefactor u(ω, Ω) = t(ω+)¯t(ω−)
and included in the transverse ladder kernel (71),

(0) = 1. Obviously, the tensor structure and q-dependence in (94) are
such that
identical to the static case (71), so that the Fourier-Laplace transforms yield the same
results, now featuring the complex mean free path ℓ(Ω). The eigenfunctions of the
transverse propagator become

gKα(q, Ω) =

(Ω)gKα(p(Ω)),

B

(97)

where the static eigenfunctions gKα(p), given in (74), are evaluated at the dynamic
reduced moment p(Ω) = qℓ(Ω). Since the atomic eigenvalues λK and χK are not
aﬀected, the ladder and crossed sums are still given by (87) and (92), with the dynamic
eigenfunctions (97). Please note that these expressions are exact in Ω and q.

6.1. Transport velocity

In order to determine the long-time and long-distance behaviour of transport, one
habitually develops the propagator to lowest orders in Ω and q. Since the atomic
internal structure has completely factorized from the frequency dependence, we
exactly recover results that are well-known from the case of resonant scattering of
scalar waves by point particles [23, 25]. Let us brieﬂy show how the main results
are obtained very easily in our framework. The small frequency behavior of (96),
(Ω) = 1 + iΩτtr + O(Ω2), deﬁnes a common transport time scale for all ﬁeld modes,

where φ(ω) is the phase of the scattering t-matrix t(ω) = Σ(ω)/N MJ . The second
term is the propagation time ℓ/vg between consecutive scatterering events with the

group velocity inside the eﬀective medium, vg = dω/dk = (1
Re Σ(ω)). The
c = 1 and the real part of the dispersion relation, k(ω) = ω
group velocity by itself looses its physical meaning in the vicinity of a scattering
resonance where extinction cannot be neglected. The transport velocity vtr = ℓ/τtr =
g +τW)−1, however, stays causal, vtr ≤
(v−1
1, at all frequencies ω, and may decrease by
orders of magnitude at resonance for a high enough density of scatterers [39, 23]. In the
present case of resonant point scatterers, the above expressions simplify remarkably
since

up to terms of order (δ/ω)2, (Γ/ω)2. The transport velocity then takes the simple form
vtr = (1 + (Γℓ)−1)−1, which corresponds to an inverted Lorentzian of width Γ because
(δ2 + Γ2/4). The sum
of the resonant character of the scattering mean free path ℓ−1
) scattering of
(100) has been called “dwell time” (in the case of non-resonant (Γ
electrons, the dwell time vanishes due to a Ward identity that is invalid for scattering
by frequency-dependent potentials [39]). The total time of transport (98) can be
written as the sum of the free propagation time ℓ between consecutive scatterers and
the dwell time 1/Γ. At resonance, for example, the Wigner time delay is τW = 2/Γ, but

(100)

24

the group velocity correction is negative since Re Σ′(ω0)/2Im Σ(ω0) =
1/Γ. Whereas
the Wigner time delay accounts for the (possibly large time) spent “inside” a resonant
scattering object, the total dwell time includes the self-consistent dressing of scatterers
by the surrounding eﬀective medium which must not be neglected.

transverse ladder modes behave like

that is responsible for an exponential decay of the mode K, α in real-space (in ﬁeld
theory, this corresponds to a ﬁnite particle mass m = ℓ−1
Kα). We notice immediately
that the intensity or scalar mode K = 0 has a diverging extinction length since
b0 = 1 and λ0 = 1 for arbitrary internal degeneracy. This true diﬀusion pole (or
massless Goldstone mode) survives thanks to a fundamental conservation law, the
conservation of energy. All other ﬁeld modes have ﬁnite, and in fact rather short
extinction lengths ℓKα(J) . ℓ, implying that the transversality of propagation mixes
well-deﬁned polarization modes. The smaller bK and λK , the shorter the extinction
length. Thus, the atomic internal degeneracy, responsible for λ1,2 < 1 as soon as J > 0,
leads to even smaller extinction lengths for non-scalar ﬁeld modes. This observation
conﬁrms the intuitive picture that degenerate Raman transitions between diﬀerent
Zeeman sublevels

contribute to scramble the ﬁeld polarization.

The scalar eigenvalue χ0 is not constrained by energy conservation and can become
very small for J > 0 (cf. ﬁgure 2). The atomic internal degeneracy breaks the
time-reversal symmetry between ladder and crossed propagators, and leads to a rapid
exponential damping of the interference modes.

Extinctions lengths of the order of or smaller than the scattering mean free path
ℓ imply that the evolution can no longer be considered diﬀusive. Amic et al. [19]
have stressed that the exact extinction length, deﬁned as the inverse of the pole of
the propagator with smallest imaginary real part, can diﬀer from the above diﬀusive
expression by as much as 50%. This diﬀerence is bound to become even worse as the
atomic eigenvalues decreases. Clearly, a quantitative prediction for the propagation
of the full vector ﬁeld must go beyond the diﬀusion approximation. This is especially
true if one is interested in coherent backscattering from a ﬁnite scattering medium,
where short paths or non-scalar ﬁeld modes can become dominant.

and independent of the atomic eigenvalues. Furthermore, a relaxation time has been
deﬁned,

The physical meaning of this relaxation time is equivalent to that of the extinction
lengths ℓKα deﬁned above since ℓ2
Kα = 3DKαtK. For the scalar mode of ﬁeld
intensity, t−1
0 = 0 implies a truly diﬀusive transport as required by local energy
conservation. For the non-scalar ﬁeld modes, the ﬁnite relaxation times t1,2 become
of the order of the transport time τtr indicating that light transport can no longer
be described accurately in the diﬀusion approximation, a tendency aggravated by the
internal atomic degeneracy leading to λ1,2 < 1. For the crossed propagator, analogous
conclusions hold. The quantum internal structure introduces dephasing times as will
be discussed elsewhere [40].

6.4. Conclusion and things to be done

In summary, we develop a consistent theory for the multiple scattering of photons
by a dilute gas of cold atoms. The external degrees of freedom of the atomic point
scatterers are supposed to be classical Poissonian variables. Particular attention is
paid to the internal degrees of freedom: a resonant dipole transition of arbitrary
degeneracy is treated analytically by a systematic use of irreducible tensor operators.
We sum the ladder diagrams of the full transverse vector ﬁeld, and calculate the
correction of multiply crossed diagrams. The internal degeneracy has no impact on
the properties of the average amplitude (such as the scattering mean free path) since
the average over a scalar internal density matrix projects onto the scalar component
of the transition matrix. Furthermore, the internal degeneracy is only coupled to the
(static) polarization vectors and completely factorized from the (dynamic) frequency
dependence. Therefore, the transport velocity and the diﬀusion constant remain
unaﬀected. However, the interference properties are strongly modiﬁed. Indeed, the
non-scalar parts of the scattering t-matrix survive in the average intensity and are
responsible for a decrease of contrast as soon as J > 0. In the diﬀusion approximation,
we give expressions for extinction lengths or relaxation times that depend in very
simple manner on J. Atoms thus appear as an important class of anisotropic scatterers
with intriguing interference properties that allow a complete analytical description of
light scattering.

The present contribution deals with transport inside an inﬁnite scattering
medium, taking full advantage of the statistical invariance under translations which
makes all operators diagonal in momentum representation. The inﬂuence of boundary
conditions, relevant for coherent backscattering or transmission experiments, may be
evaluated in the framework of the exact Wiener-Hopf method or of the approximate
method of images. Both approaches deserve a detailed discussion which is beyond

Multiple scattering of light by atoms with internal degeneracy

the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere [41]. Another important
issue is the inﬂuence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. Perhaps the systematic use of
irreducible tensors can help to simplify the theoretical description of light transport
in magneto-active media [42]. In addition, the impact of a splitting of the internal
Zeeman degeneracy remains to be studied, experimentally as well as theoretically.

The transversality of the propagating light ﬁeld imposes a change of polarization
in the course of multiple scattering. In this respect, the present theory provides a
microscopic analogue of spin-orbit coupling studied extensively in electronic disordered
systems [8]. But contrary to the electron case of spin 1
2 , no weak anti-localization for
the spin 1 photon can be expected, however strong the spin-orbit coupling. The
scattering of photons by atoms with internal degeneracy appears as an analogue of
spin-ﬂip scattering of electrons by magnetic impurities [8]. Interestingly, we can derive
exact expressions for characteristic extinction lengths and relaxation times, and further
experimental as well as theoretical studies can be envisaged. The links between optics
and atomic physics on the one hand and condensed matter physics on the other thus
promise to continue to be an important source of inspiration to both ﬁelds.

The three functions ˆs0(p) (deﬁned in (A.7)), ˆs1(p) and ˆs2(p) are not independent.
Indeed, the contraction of indices in the quadratic term (A.12) must reproduce the
scalar integral (A.7), so that ˆs0(p) = 2ˆs1(p) + ˆs2(p).

The purely antisymmetric component of the transverse propagator (A.3) contains

only scalar and quadratic terms, so that the previous results permit to write

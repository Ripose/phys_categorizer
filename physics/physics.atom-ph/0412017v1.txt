(Dated: Draft March 3, 2008)

We exploit the process of asymmetry ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission which provides an
original method for parity violation (PV) measurements in a highly forbidden atomic transition.
The method involves measurements of a chiral, transient, optical gain of a cesium vapor on the
7S − 6P3/2 transition, probed after it is excited by an intense, linearly polarized, collinear laser,
tuned to resonance for one hyperﬁne line of the forbidden 6S-7S transition in a longitudinal electric
ﬁeld. We report here a 3.5 fold increase, of the one-second-measurement sensitivity, and subsequent
reduction by a factor of 3.5 of the statistical accuracy compared with our previous result [J. Gu´ena
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 143001 (2003)]. Decisive improvements to the set-up include an
increased repetition rate, better extinction of the probe beam at the end of the probe pulse and,
for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, the following: a polarization-tilt magniﬁer, quasi-suppression
of beam reﬂections at the cell windows, and a Cs cell with electrically conductive windows. We
also present real-time tests of systematic eﬀects, consistency checks on the data, as well as a 1%
accurate measurement of the electric ﬁeld seen by the atoms, from atomic signals. PV measurements
performed in seven diﬀerent vapor cells agree within the statistical error. Our present result is
compatible with the more precise Boulder result within our present relative statistical accuracy of
−13 atomic-unit uncertainty in Epv
2.7%, corresponding to a 2 × 10
1 . Theoretical motivations for
further measurements are emphasized and we give a brief overview of a recent proposal that would
allow the uncertainty to be reduced to the 0.1% level by creating conditions where asymmetry
ampliﬁcation is much greater.

INTRODUCTION: GOAL OF THE EXPERIMENT

Parity Violation (PV) in stable atoms is a manifestation of the weak interaction involving the exchange of a neutral
vector boson Z 0 between the electron and the nucleus.
It shows up in high precision measurements testing the
symmetry properties of the process of optical absorption, hence in conditions very diﬀerent from those of high energy
experiments [1, 2]. However, the eﬀects in stable atoms are so small that their detection requires the choice of very
i.e. the use of a heavy atom because of the Z 3 enhancement factor, and a highly forbidden
peculiar conditions:
transition to avoid the electromagnetic interaction completely overwhelming the weak interaction. This explains why
we ﬁrst selected the highly forbidden 6S
7S transition of atomic cesium [3] at 539 nm. In the s-orbitals the valence
electron penetrating close to the nucleus, just where the short-range weak interaction can be felt, is accelerated in the
Coulomb potential associated with the nuclear charge Ze, with a strength reinforced by relativistic eﬀects. Therefore,
electron-nucleus momentum transfers of 1 MeV/c can occur, even though the atoms are irradiated by photons of only
3.8 eV.

In absence of any applied electric ﬁeld, the 6S-7S transition electric-dipole amplitude is strictly forbidden by the
laws of electromagnetism. We measure the contribution which arises from the weak interaction, Epv
1 . Its order of
magnitude is 0.8
1 for usual allowed transitions in atoms. We compare it
∼
with the 6S-7S transition electric-dipole amplitude induced by an applied electric ﬁeld, βE. These measurements can
be used to extract the weak charge Qexp
W of the cesium nucleus via an atomic physics calculation, for comparison with
the theoretical prediction Qth
W of the Standard Model (SM) of electroweak uniﬁcation theory. Thanks to the relative
simplicity of the atomic structure of cesium having a single valence electron, this calculation is reliable, its accuracy
having now reached 0.5% [4]. Moreover, if the measurements are performed on two diﬀerent hyperﬁne components,
the results can provide a determination of the nuclear anapole moment [1, 4].

The ﬁrst measurements of Epv
1

in cesium were performed by our own group [5]. They were followed by calibrated
[6], more precise ones (0.5%), achieved by the Boulder group [7, 8]. Today, the latter imply no signiﬁcant deviation of
Qexp
W with respect to the SM prediction [4]. By contrast, the reported value of the nuclear anapole moment presents
serious discrepancies compared with other manifestations of parity violating nuclear forces [4, 9]. Our goal is to
achieve an independent measurement, as precise as possible, by a diﬀerent method in order to cross-check the Boulder
result. Our new approach is based on a pump-probe experiment using two collinear laser beams which operate in
pulsed mode, for detection of the forbidden transition by stimulated emission. Except for the choice of the transition
and the use of an applied electric ﬁeld, this very diﬀerent method has nothing in common with the previous PV

measurements using ﬂuorescence detection [5, 7]. We validated this new approach with a 9% precision measurement
in 2002. This was published in [10] where we suggested further improvements of the signal over noise ratio (SNR)
by using higher quality cell windows allowing better cancellation of the reﬂected beams [11] as well as a polarization
magniﬁer [12]. These and additional modiﬁcations of the set-up together with a tighter control of the systematic
eﬀects, have resulted in a much better SNR. This paper reports on their implementation and on the subsequent
measurement of Epv
that has now reached a precision of 2.7%. It is organized as follows. In Sect. II, we describe the
1
principles and implementation of the experiment. The recent decisive improvements of the experimental set-up, and
their eﬀect on the SNR are presented in Sect. III. Thereafter we describe the control and estimation of the systematic
eﬀects (Sect. IV). After a summary of the PV data acquisition and processing, we indicate how we have improved
the measurement of the electric ﬁeld seen by the atoms in situ and we present our current PV result together with
consistency tests on the data (Sect. V). Finally, the implications of this kind of measurement are discussed and we
conclude by considering short and longer term prospects (Sect. VI).

II. EXPERIMENT: PRINCIPLES AND IMPLEMENTATION

A. Detection of a chiral optical gain by stimulated emission

An intense laser pulse, tuned to resonance for one hyperﬁne component of the 6S1/2 −

7S1/2 transition creates, in a
time interval short compared with the 7S lifetime (48 ns), a large population diﬀerence between the 7S and the 6P3/2
states, which is immediately detected by a probe laser pulse tuned to resonance with one hyperﬁne component of the
6P3/2 transition. This pulse is ampliﬁed by stimulated emission and compared with a reference pulse sent
7S1/2 −
through the vapor once no more atoms remain in the 7S and 6P states. Figure 1 shows the timing of the experiment.
In this way it is possible to extract the atomic contribution to the ampliﬁed probe intensity transmitted through the
vapor. It is the polarization modiﬁcation of the ampliﬁed probe beam which can exhibit Parity Violation.

1

An electric ﬁeld ~El is applied collinear with the excitation beam. This induces an electric-dipole, “Stark” transition
= βEl, large enough for the ﬁeld to control conveniently the transition rate. The direction of ~El
amplitude EStark
and the linear excitation polarization ˆǫex deﬁne two planes of symmetry of the experiment. Without any PV eﬀect,
the eigenaxes of the excited vapor would lie inside those planes of symmetry. PV actually shows up as an angular
tilt of the eigenaxes outside of those planes. The tilt angle, θpv equal to the ratio ImEpv
, odd under reversal
of the electric ﬁeld, is the relevant physical quantity to be measured. From the tilt of the optical axes, it results
that the two mirror-image conﬁgurations of Fig. 2, deﬁned by ~El, ˆǫex and the linear probe polarization ˆǫpr oriented
45◦, are not physically equivalent: they lead to diﬀerent ampliﬁcation factors, i.e. to a linear dichroism on the
at
~El), i.e. chiral,
probe transition . This PV linear dichroism is associated with the pseudoscalar (ˆǫex ·
contribution to the gain of the excited vapor [13].

When the excitation pulse is switched on with ˆǫex parallel (or orthogonal) to ˆǫpr, we expect the PV eﬀect to give rise to

probe intensity in either one of the two mirror conﬁgurations of Fig. 2. For each excitation pulse, the diﬀerence

(see Sect V D and [16]), it describes well all the observed features of the ampliﬁcation process. Moreover, the factor
K is eliminated in the calibration procedure allowing us to convert the imbalance into an absolute θpv angle. We
achieve this by performing with a Faraday rotator an angular tilt of the excitation polarization with respect to ˆǫpr,
of a precisely known magnitude θcal, and by measuring the resulting imbalance: Kθcal.

B.

Important diﬀerences with respect to the Boulder experiment

Conceptually the present experiment [10, 15, 17] is very diﬀerent from that of the Boulder group [7, 18]. This is

illustrated by a set of features summarized below:

•

•

•

•

•

•

We have a direct measurement of a left-right (LR) asymmetry, ALR, instead of a transition rate superimposed
on a background of 25%.

As shown by Eq. 1 we beneﬁt from an ampliﬁcation of the (LR) asymmetry with the optical density for the
probe
(see Eq. 1 and[16]). As a result the parameter we measure ALR is an increasing function of El instead
of one falling as 1/El.

A

We employ a longitudinal ~El-ﬁeld conﬁguration instead of a transverse ~E and ~B-ﬁeld conﬁguration. The absence
of Stark-M1 interference in this conﬁguration suppresses a potential source of systematic eﬀect troublesome in
a transverse E-ﬁeld.

Our experiment is not limited to the two ∆F =

1 hyperﬁne components but can be extended to all of them.

±

Our experiment is absent from line-shape distorsion and line-overlap problems.

Our line-shape independent calibration is performed continuously: the PV signal (PV alignment) is calibrated
in real time by a signal of the same nature (Stark alignment [19]), as opposed to the calibration of the Boulder
experiment, made diﬃcult by incomplete line-resolution, saturation and background eﬀects [18].

Direct detection of an angular anisotropy in the 7S state, which ensures speciﬁcity of the signal, is obtained to the
1 in 10 s
detriment of the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR); the latter is deﬁnitely lower than that achieved in Boulder,
[7]. However, with the SNR improvement reported in this paper, the sensitivity of our pump-probe method already
appears adequate for APV measurements at the 1% level and we mention (Sect. VI) an extension of the method
expected to improve considerably the quantum, shot-noise limit.

Table 1 summarizes all the parameter reversals which allow us to identify the PV signal owing to its well deﬁned
signature. They fall into three categories: i) the two most rapid ones, 1 and 2, allow us to isolate the LR asymmetry
Dref ; ii) the next ones, 3 to 5, select the El-odd, polarimeter imbalance
of purely atomic origin, ALR ≡
45◦ of the probe polarization; iii) then, 6 and 7,
behaving like a linear dichroism of the atomic vapor with axes at
exploit the invariance of the PV eﬀect under simultaneous rotation of the excitation and probe polarizations about
the common beam direction [19]. Thus, the measurements are performed in eight diﬀerent conﬁgurations of ˆǫex , ˆǫpr
represented in Table 1 lower box. An additional fast reversal, not acting on the PV signal, is the ˆǫex tilt by an angle
θcal, required for calibrating the polarimeter imbalances. When the laser repetition rate is adjusted to 150 Hz, total
completion of all these reversals takes 5 minutes and provides two “isotropic” determinations of θpv. Finally, after
data acquisition for a period of typically 90 min, we reverse the slight tilt (
3 mrad) of the cell axis with respect to
that of the laser beams (see Sect. II D below ). Hence our experimental procedure provides an 8-fold signature for
the PV signal. More details on data acquisition and processing are given in Sect. V.

Figure 3 shows a general schematic view of the experiment. A detailed description of the various elements was
presented in 1998 [17]. Since then, the important modiﬁcations we have made mainly concern the cesium vapor cells
and the electric ﬁeld generator. In particular, previously the cells were made of glass, with 9 electrical feedthroughs
and internal electrodes. They are now made of a simple alumina or sapphire tube (length: 83 mm, internal diameter
10 mm) with a sapphire window glued at each end [20] and a side arm containing Cs metal. Surface conductivity of
the cesiated walls is considerably lower than with cesiated glass [21], which allows us to use external electrodes [22].

external-electrode set-up, together with the production of the ﬂat-top reversible high voltage pulses [24], are shown

However, the ﬁrst signals in the sapphire cells showed the presence of unacceptable stray ﬁelds resulting from

rings on the internal surface of the wall: these prevented charge multiplication of the longitudinally accelerated
photoelectrons striking the wall at grazing incidence. After this decisive step [25], signiﬁcant PV measurements could
start and a preliminary 9% accurate measurement validating our detection method [10] was achieved.

We, now present the further decisive improvements brought to the set-up since these initial measurements.

III. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRESS SINCE THE VALIDATION OF THE METHOD

A.

Improvement of the excitation laser source

1. Long term frequency stabilization on a 127I2 molecular line

Since our calibration procedure eliminates any dependence of the signals on the line shape, slow drifts of the
excitation and probe frequencies are not a source of systematic error. However, it is important that the lasers stay
at resonance to preserve the optimum of the SNR, particularly in a PV experiment where the data acquisition lasts
over long periods of time.

The probe beam frequency is stabilized on a hyperﬁne component of the 7S

6P3/2 transition, using polarization
spectroscopy in an auxiliary Cs cell in which a discharge continuously populates the 6P3/2 level. A similar, method

(case of the 6SF =3 →
then control it at regular time intervals. Although the vessel containing the reference Fabry-Perot cavity is evacuated
and temperature stabilized, the excitation laser frequency drifts by typically a few megahertz per minute. Although
we ﬁrst used a correction procedure assuming a linear drift, the slope was not constant enough for the approach to
be reliable. To do better we stabilized the reference cavity on an iodine molecular line.

By observing the ﬂuorescence of Iodine in the region of interest and by using the theoretical spectrum of 127I2 given

increase the absorption signal and saturation eﬀects are enhanced by focusing the laser beams into the cell with 30 cm
focal lenses.

this beam, i.e. the pump, is passed twice through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM1), shifting the frequency by
200 MHz. The small fraction of it, (the probe) is passed through a second acousto-optic modulator, AOM2,
∆ν1 =
200 MHz and superposed with the pump in the I2 vapor along a counterpropagating
shifted in frequency by ∆ν2 ∼ −
path. The saturation spectroscopy signal appears when the sum of the laser frequency νlaser and 1
2 (∆ν1 + ∆ν2)
is resonant with the iodine vapor. To achieve enough sensitivity, a frequency modulation (amplitude 2.0 MHz,
modulation frequency 19 kHz) is superimposed on ∆ν1. Then, by lock-in detection of the transmitted probe intensity
at the pump modulation frequency, we can observe the derivative of the absorption signal. The centre of this symmetric
dispersion shaped signal (Fig.5) is used to stabilize the external Fabry-Perot reference cavity. Then, by adjusting
7SF =4 Cs transition with a 1 MHz reproductibility.
∆ν2, we can tune νlaser to the center of the hyperﬁne 6SF =3 →
Note that the use of two AOMs is very helpful, since it ensures excellent rejection of any Doppler background and
absence of stray light modulated at the signal frequency without requiring the use of a reference beam.

−

At the beginning of a PV data acquisition, the shift ∆ν2 is adjusted so as to maximize the probe ampliﬁcation in
the cesium cell or, for higher sensitivity, to cancel out the relevant dispersion shaped signal. Because of the a.c. Stark
shift ∆ν(iex) induced by the excitation laser, the value of the adjusted shift ∆ν2 depends on the excitation energy iex:
∆ν2(iex) =
2∆ν(iex), since ∆ν1 is kept ﬁxed. The a.c. Stark shift is shown in Fig. 6. Since the excitation and the
probe pulses overlap, the intense excitation pulse shifts both the excitation and the probe transition frequencies, by
∆νex and ∆νpr respectively. In our operating conditions, ∆ν2 is thus a linear combination of both shifts. Whatever
the value of iex, the probe laser frequency remains locked to the atomic transition observed in a reference cesium cell
where the excitation beam is absent. Consequently, in presence of the excitation beam, the probe beam is no longer
resonant for the atomic zero-velocity class, but becomes resonant for atoms of velocity c∆νpr(iex)/νpr. The maximum
of ampliﬁcation occurs when the excitation beam is resonant with that same velocity class. The laser shift required
to be at resonance is then ∆νlaser(iex) = ∆νex(iex)
∆νpr(iex). Hence, the shift of ∆ν2 accompanying the iex
variations is interpreted as:

(2)

Since νex/νpr = 2.72, we note the large sensitivity of ∆ν2(iex) to the a.c. Stark shift of the probe transition.

At ﬁrst sight the large Stark-shift diﬀerence between the two hyperﬁne lines shown on Fig. 6 might look surprising.
We have shown that it arises from the additional a.c. Stark shift, of opposite sign, induced by the probe beam when
it is ampliﬁed during propagation through the vapor, the proportionality to iex resulting from the ampliﬁcation. This
eﬀect is, like the ampliﬁcation, greater for the 3-4-5 system than for the 3-4-4 one.

Physik FL 2003) with three cuvettes through which circulates a dye solution (Coumarin 153 in Methanol) pumped
by a XeCl excimer laser (18 ns long pulses, 100 mJ at 308 nm) at a maximum repetition rate of 200 Hz. With
transverse pumping, it is not straightforward to obtain the desired ideal circular spatial proﬁle of the beam. Following
the constructor’s advice, we have tried to improve the situation by replacing the parallelepipedic cuvette used in the
last ampliﬁer by a Bethune cell which ensures pumping with cylindrical symmetry. Actually, a nice circular shape
was obtained, but only at repetition rates below 30 Hz. At higher rates an unacceptable jitter of the beam position
appeared which was attributed to the turbulence of the liquid ﬂowing through the cell. Therefore we had to abandon
the Bethune cell.

However, having gained experience with the Bethune cell, more thorough and more eﬃcient realignments were
made with the rectangular cell. A more powerful dye circulation system, with an adjustable ﬂow rate, was installed
[27]. Finally, a stable circular proﬁle could be obtained reproducibly at repetition rates up to 180 Hz, with only little
dependence on the day-to-day realignments and on the aging of the dye-solution. Figure 7 illustrates such a typical
proﬁle.

Increasing the probe beam extinction ratio

1. Motivations

The optical switch which produces 20 ns long optical pulses from the continuous probe laser source at 1.47 µm, is
a key-component of the set-up. It turns out that the noise performances of our detection method depends crucially
1 ns) and
on its extinction ratio. This integrated device [28] driven by low voltages, has rapid rise- and fall-times (
its extinction ratio is usually as low as 10−3. But, probably due to humidity changes, occasionally it rises to several
times 10−3, rendering reliable measurements impossible.
Indeed, the leakage photons going through the “closed”
optical switch continue to probe the Cs vapor. They participate in the detected signal for the time characteristic of
the photocurrent integration operated by the dual detection chain at each probe pulse [29]. Since the 6P3/2 state,
of the 5 µs eﬀective lifetime due to resonance radiation trapping, is progressively populated in the early stages of
deexcitation of the vapor [30], the time-integrated probe intensity undergoes a prohibitively large absorption. The
baseline of the charge integrated pulse (20 ns rise time followed by a 50 µs exponential decay) becomes distorted

and ﬂuctuates. This causes noise that is not completely ﬁltered out by the gaussian pulse shaper (adjusted with
τi = τd = τ = 1 µs for optimal noise rejection [29]). To prevent noise blasts due to the unpredictable behaviour of
the optical switch, we installed a Pockels cell in series with it.

2. Operating conditions of the Pockels cell and the optical switch

We placed the Pockels cell (PC) right at the input of the optical switch (OS). This provides the advantage of reducing
considerably the periods of illumination of the OS, probably a wise protection against possible photo-creation of color
centers in the integrated waveguides. The transmission is 91 % and the extinction ratio 0.4%. The PC is driven by a
fast pulse generator (fall and rise time of about 20 ns, minimum pulse duration 100 ns [31]). As shown in the inset of
80 ns before the OS opens but it is interrupted shortly after the OS closes. Figure
Fig. 8, the beam is let through
8 also illustrates the eﬀect of the PC on the absorption measurements. We plot the measured absorption with or
without the PC versus the extinction ratio of the OS, varied at will by changing the driving voltage. When the PC
is operated, the probe absorption is considerably reduced and the initial dependences on both the extinction ratio of
the OS and the time constant of the shaper disappear.

3. Trigger system for synchronized operation of the cell and the switch

The synchronisation of the whole system presented a technical diﬃculty because the ﬁrst probe pulse ampliﬁed by
the vapor is followed by four reference probe pulses separated in time by about 1 ms, for making negligible the photon
shot noise on the reference measurements. It is important that the shape of the reference pulses be identical to that of
the ﬁrst probe pulse. This requires excellent synchronization between the pulses which drive the Pockels cell and the

pulse so as to avoid a temporal pump-probe jitter (

The triggering system implemented is sketched in Fig. 9. It has two diﬀerent operating modes, one requiring operation
of the excimer system, the other, which does not, being used for preliminary procedures (probe beam alignment and
polarimeter adjustment).

C. A birefringence-free polarization-tilt magniﬁer

1. Principle of polarization-tilt magniﬁcation

In an earlier work [12], we suggested using a dichroic component to amplify the tilt angle acquired by the probe
beam after its passage through the excited vapor. The idea is simply to transmit diﬀerently the polarizations along two
orthogonal directions, the direction of the incoming beam and the orthogonal direction. In this way we can attenuate
the polarization parallel to the incoming probe polarization, whilst letting through the orthogonal polarization which
carries the important information, i.e. the tiny component resulting from the tilt induced by the vapor.

Let us suppose that ˆx is the incoming probe polarization and that the transmission coeﬃcients of our dichroic
1 in the two eigen-directions ˆx and ˆy. It is seen easily that
device for the amplitude of the ﬁeld are tx = 0.5 and ty ≃
after passage through this device, the angle between the light polarization and the ˆx direction is multiplied by 2. The
light intensity reaching each detector is divided by 4. Such a “polarization magniﬁer” does not automatically lead to
an increase of the SNR. In the shot noise limit, we cannot expect any SNR improvement, except if we increase the
intensity of the probe beam at the input of the cell provided that the asymmetry ampliﬁcation is not damped under
the eﬀect of saturation by the probe beam intensity [32]. Actually with the 1.5 mW power available in the Cs cell
(100 mW at the output of the color center laser), there are, as expected [32], no troublesome saturation eﬀects for
the probe transition the best suited to PV measurements, 7SF =4 −
We note that the magniﬁer plays the same role as the “uncrossed polarizer” in the quasi-extinction method of
polarimetry. Thereby, this dichroic element allows us to combine the advantages of two well-known operating modes
of polarimetry: quasi-extinction mode and balanced-mode. In the former, intensity noise is reduced by optimizing
the uncrossing angle, while the latter allows one to suppress all common-mode noise.

6PF =4.

2. Realization

Initially, we considered the possibility of using a single plate with a dichroic multilayer coating [12, 33], but this
solution suﬀered from problems linked with the large, incidence-dependent, birefringence of the coating. We ﬁnally
turned to a stack of 4 or 6 silica plates at Brewster incidence. This arrangement yields the required dichroic factor (
∼
2 or 3) and birefringence is acceptably small provided that interference between multiple reﬂections are suppressed
by using wedged, tilted plates, so that no two surfaces are parallel [34].

As explained previously, the polarization of the incoming probe beam at cell entrance determines the polarization
direction that has to be attenuated before reaching the polarimeter. For practical reasons, the device operates in a
ﬁxed position, with the incidence plane vertical. Nevertheless, we can use it in any of the four possible directions of
the probe polarization, thanks to two additional half-wave plates which restore the polarization direction before the
magniﬁer.

[exp (η

We have found that the device with either four or six plates, operates satisfactorily with very stable characteristics.
Without the magniﬁer, the calibration left-right asymmetry for a tilt θcal of ˆǫex with respect to ˆǫpr is compatible with
1)] (Eq. 1). With the magniﬁer in position, the measured left-right asymmetry
the expected value 2θcal ×
is ampliﬁed with respect to that value by the expected factor ty/tx, for the eight pump-probe conﬁgurations. As to
the gain in SNR, we estimate it to be about 1.5 to 2 with the 4-plate device. The 6-plate device improves this result
i) since we could not increase the input intensity suﬃciently
slightly, by at most 20%. This is not so surprising:
to compensate for the twice higher attenuation factor(t2
1/8 instead of 1/4), the small intensity independent
y ≈
contribution of noise increased accordingly and ii) at the highest available intensity atomic saturation started to show
up on the asymmetry ampliﬁcation.

Finally, we mention improvements on the probe beam part of the experiment. Residual etalon eﬀects inside the
polarimeter have been cancelled out. The short-term stability of the servo loop used to stabilize the probe laser
frequency has been improved. Since the detected probe ﬂux is lower when the magniﬁer is in use, (even though the
incoming probe intensity is higher), we have increased the gain of the charge-integrating preampliﬁers, by changing
the input capacitor from 7 to 4 nF, so as to use the whole dynamic range of the detection chain.

D. Control of the beam reﬂection at the cell windows

Due to the high refraction index of sapphire (n=1.77), reﬂection of the input laser power at each window is about
15% and can be a source of losses on the 7S excited atom density (reﬂection at the entrance window) or of uncontrolled
contributions (reﬂection at the output window). One might also worry about interferences taking place between the
two windows which are precisely mounted, normal to the cell axis (tilt less than 1 mrad).

1.

Interferences inside and between the windows: source of noise

Important progress has been achieved with the realization of the extinction of the excitation beam reﬂected by
the windows. Depending on its parallelism, any cell window behaves more or less as a temperature-tunable Fabry
Perot etalon [11]. In the very ﬁrst cell used for measurements, imperfect parallelism prevented us from obtaining a
10−2. An interference pattern was distinguishable in the reﬂected beam proﬁle,
reﬂection coeﬃcient lower than
×
with a contrast and intensity varying with the position of the beam impact and with the incidence. We also observed
that tuning the window temperature at a reﬂection maximum (Rmax ≃
20%) caused an increase of noise. All the
subsequent cells were fabricated [20] with windows made by Meller Optics [35] with both an excellent parallelism
(better than 10 µrad over the 6 mm diameter central region) and very good [0001] crystal axis orientation (defect on
10−3 for a 0.5 mm thick window). As expected, we clearly observed
C-axis orientation
a reduction of the noise. The reﬂection could be reduced to a few times 10−3 per window thanks to temperature
stabilization (to 0.1◦ C) achieved independently for each window.

Given the window thickness, we obtain successive reﬂection minima at 540 nm by shifting the temperature by
successive intervals of 14◦ C while the FSR corresponds to 40◦ C at the probe wavelength. Hence, we cannot expect
to obtain reﬂection extinction of comparable quality simultaneously at both wavelengths. However, by varying the
operating point by increments of 14◦ C over a wide acceptable temperature range (210 - 270◦ C) one can choose
an operating temperature which provides the best probe transmission with excellent reﬂection extinction for the
excitation beam. In a majority of cells we could obtain a
95% probe transmission leading to a further improvement
≈
of the observed SNR. This is likely to result from the quasi-suppression of the interference between the probe beams
reﬂected at the input and output windows. No systematic eﬀect is expected from this interference, due to the way
we process and calibrate the PV data. As a result of drifts in the interference order, however, we do expect noise
associated with temperature drifts of the cell-body, even though cell-windows are accurately stabilized. The smaller
the amplitude of this interference, the smaller the associated noise.

2.

The tilt-odd eﬀect: interpretation and suppression

When the probe beam is at normal incidence to one of the windows, we observe an excess of noise in the polarimeter
signals making precise measurements impossible. Although the ideal conﬁguration requires perfect alignment of both
laser beams along the cell axis, we have to concede a small tilt of the cell axis with respect to the beams (ψ
3 mrad).
Since such a tilt breaks the symmetry, we reverse its sign after about 90 minutes of data acquisition, and we average the
results obtained with both tilts, aﬀected in practice by similar statistical noise. The reversal ψ
ψ is performed by
tilting the oven containing the cell while keeping the position of the beams unchanged. We now justify this procedure
which suppresses a possible systematic eﬀect. (An overview of the systematics is given in Section IV).

enough, using a four-quadrant cell, to avoid any really signiﬁcant contribution. However, a problem can arise from
the portion of the excitation beam back-reﬂected by the output window, which is misaligned with the probe beam.
Let us denote by ˆk′

where R is the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the output window. It simulates the PV eﬀect, except that it is odd under the
ψ
ψ reversal. We have neglected the loss of detection eﬃciency due to the incomplete overlap of the probe beam
and reﬂected excitation beam since for ψ = 3 mrad, the beam separation is only 0.5 mm at the entrance of the cell,
which is less than the probe beam radius of 0.7 mm.

With R = 0.10, a typical value for standard sapphire (n=1.77) windows, taking ψ= 3 mrad and E+

10−3,
using Eq. 4 we predict < θsyst >ˆǫex= 0.9 µrad. This reduces to 0.02 µrad for good windows with R=0.002. For
larger tilts, the overlap of the probe and reﬂected excitation beams is partial and the ψ-odd contribution (Eq. 4) is
not expected to grow linearly, but actually to saturate. Indeed, this corresponds to our observations when the tilt is
increased up to ψ

t /El = 3

5mrad.

×

In conclusion, the tilt-odd eﬀect could correspond to a source of systematic eﬀect if there were no means to suppress
it. Actually, we have two ways to reduce this eﬀect eﬃciently i) by reducing the reﬂection coeﬃcient to the 10−3 level,
and ii) by reversing the sign of ψ. The most convenient way to perform the tilt reversal of the cell axis with respect
to the unchanged common beam direction, is to rotate the cell around a vertical axis passing through its center. The
displacement of the beam impact on each window is only 240 µm. On such a small scale, the value of E+
is not

expected to change, which is in fact conﬁrmed by our control of the transverse ﬁelds. This is important for eﬃcient
suppression of this eﬀect.

We want to mention a second source of tilt-odd eﬀect.

In [19] we analyzed the systematic eﬀect generated by
the combined action of the transverse electric and magnetic ﬁeld components E−

of the longitudinal ﬁeld. By tilting the cell, together with the HV electrodes assembly [22], we produce an electric

E. A cesium cell with electrical continuity between inner and outer sides of conductive windows

The last improvement consisted in our using sapphire windows covered with a niobium, 2 µm thick, coating deposited
over a thin layer of titanium, except for the 6 mm central region left uncovered for the laser beams. This type of
coating allows one to control better the electric ﬁeld near the windows, since the HV potential can be applied inside
the cesium cell by direct contact with the outer part of the metal coating. By comparison with what happens when the
window potential is ﬂoating, the electric charges left at the windows as a result of photoionization are more eﬃciently
compensated by those supplied by the generator maintaining the potential ﬁxed.

The vacuum-tight gluing of such coated windows to the alumina tube, under vacuum to prevent the coating from

oxidation, was implemented by David Sarkisyan and co-workers [36].

In this last cell we have obtained the best SNR, corresponding to a further
A measurement method relying on atomic signals (described in Sec. V D) has allowed us to determine precisely the
electric ﬁeld experienced by the atoms inside the cell. It is interesting to compare the measured value Eexp
l with the
magnitude Enom expected from the numerical simulation taking into account the geometry of the electrode assembly
and the potential distribution (for details see [22]). The results exhibit a marked diﬀerence between the cell having
electrically conductive windows, where we ﬁnd Eexp

0.01, and a cell with uncoated windows, leading to
Eexp
0.01. The simulation does not take into account the distribution of electric charges inside the cell
l
resulting from the photoionization at the windows. Accounting for this process, the observed variation of Eexp
/Enom
from one type of cell to the other is not surprising: photo-emission leaves a positive surface charge at the cathode
window, and the accelerated electrons accumulate at the anode window, giving rise to a negative surface charge.
Applying the potential, via the coatings, at the inside surface of the windows contributes to screening the eﬀect of
the surface charges in the vapor. In addition, the photoelectrons that reach the anode window at the periphery are
evacuated through the coating. The applied electric ﬁeld is then expected to be closer to the calculated electrode
ﬁeld.

IV. CONTROL, REDUCTION AND ESTIMATION OF THE SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS

In this section, we present an overview of the origins of the systematic eﬀects and the means we adopted to reduce
and estimate them, (to the exception of the tilt-odd eﬀects considered previously in Sect. III D) . The order chosen
in this presentation corresponds to decreasing order of importance played by each eﬀect.

A. The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld odd under reversal of ~El

We have observed a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld odd under reversal of ~El, dubbed the B−

z ﬁeld. Its likely origin
is the motion of electric charges following the photoionization process which may have a small helicity around the
propagation axis. The B−
z ﬁeld gives rise to an El-odd Larmor precession of the axes of the parity-conserving linear
dichroism, thus simulating the PV tilt angle. Even in a ﬁeld as small as B−
z = 50 µG, the precession is of the same
order of magnitude as θpv.

We measure this ﬁeld by observing the optical rotation, odd under ~El reversal, that it generates by a simple Faraday
eﬀect [39]. This control is performed by selecting a hyperﬁne component of the probe transition particularly sensitive
6P3/2,F =5 line is 10 times larger than the linear dichroism
to a magnetic ﬁeld. The Faraday eﬀect on the 7SF =4 →
resulting from the Larmor precession of the excited state alignment which might simulate APV. In order not to rely
on the temporal stability of the value of B−
z during long acquisition times, the measurement is made before and after
the PV data taking. At regular intervals the calibration factor for the Faraday eﬀect is obtained by applying a “large”,
6P3/2,F =4 probe transition for the calibration factor of the
known, magnetic ﬁeld. This is also done on the 7SF =4 →
dichroism precession. Thus the measured value of θpv can be corrected for reliably and accurately. Both the sign and
magnitude of B−
z ﬁeld varied from one cell to another. In the best cases, the correction remained at the level of a
few percent of the PV eﬀect, while it was of the same order in two cells (cells #5 and 6). The time devoted to B−
z
measurements varied from 30 to 60% of the total data acquisition time. It was chosen so that the error associated
with the resulting correction on θpv remained small compared to the statistical accuracy of the PV measurement.

B. Eﬀects resulting from a breaking of the cylindrical symmetry

Particular attention has been given to the defects that break the cylindrical symmetry of the set-up, such as
transverse ~E and ~B ﬁelds and misalignment of the two beams. Our study [19] has shown that for the polarimeter
imbalance to be altered in a way which simulates θpv, two defects are necessary. Some of the systematics (“class
2”-systematics in [19]) average to zero when the two polarizations ˆǫex, ˆǫpr are rotated together by 45◦ increments

this operation. They all require the presence of a transverse electric ﬁeld.

These class 1 eﬀects have two diﬀerent origins:
1. Pump-probe misalignment by an angle δα ˆn = ˆkex ∧

ˆkpr.

This misalignment gives rise to a systematic eﬀect on the measurement of θpv by its coupling to an E+
ﬁeld, even under El reversal. Our method to minimize this eﬀect is:

i) to superpose the pump and probe beams, on the same centering device, at the input and output of

the cell, (see Sect. 3.3 in ref [17]);

ii) to measure the transverse E+

of well-deﬁned signature allows us to extract the components of the transverse magnetic ﬁelds (see Sect. 5 in

with the residual ~Bt ﬁeld values extracted on the 7S1/2,F =4 →
6P3/2,F =5 transition (for the same tilt of the cell), to
yield the systematics aﬀecting the PV data. On a day-to-day basis, the size of these eﬀects is a few percent of the
PV eﬀect. They are aﬀected by a statistical uncertainty small compared to the statistical error on θpv. It could be
corrected for when signiﬁcantly non-zero. But, on the average for a given cell, this uncertainty was kept below the
percent level, with the exception of one cell (cell #4) for which a correction of
10% was applied to one third of the
data. Besides the estimation of the eﬀects that break the cylindrical symmetry, a test of isotropy on the PV data
themselves provides a diagnosis of their presence. It is presented in Sect. V C.

C. Possible instrumental defect aﬀecting the orientation of ˆǫex

We have considered the possible existence of a tilt θ−

0 , odd under ~El reversal, aﬀecting the excitation polarization
at the entrance of the Cs cell. Since the direction of ˆǫex determines the direction of the P-conserving gain axes, such
an instrumental defect would exactly simulate the PV tilt θpv.
It is therefore crucial to check that the direction
of ˆǫex is unaﬀected by the ﬁeld reversal. During PV data acquisition, a second polarimeter is used to analyze the
excitation polarization using a fraction of the main beam, picked oﬀ at the cell entrance (see Fig 3). Throughout
the measurements, θ−
0.020 µrad, is
compatible with zero. This kind of eﬀect might have arisen from electromagnetic interferences resulting from pulsed
~El monitoring.

D. Misreversal of ~El combined with polarization defects

A misreversal of ~El cannot contribute by itself, but only through a combined eﬀect also involving polarization
defects (e.g. imperfect parallelism of ˆǫex and ˆǫpr). In fact our reconstitution method protects us eﬃciently against
such an eﬀect since we perform the imbalance calibration for both signs of the ~El ﬁeld. As one can check from Eq.
(8) below, this method eliminates any ﬁeld misreversal from the outset. Nevertheless, the defects are kept below the
10−4 by preliminary
noise level: ﬁeld misreversal
manual corrections based on atomic signals [15] and real-time monitoring. The defects are stable owing to the good
optical quality, homogeneity, small birefringence..., of the optical components and cell windows, as well as good
reproducibility of the insertion of the λ/2 plates.

V. DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING. CALIBRATIONS. RESULTS

A. Reconstruction of the PV signal and data acquisition sequences.

On an excitation pulse basis, our dual channel polarimeter provides the imbalance, (S1 −

S2)/(S1 + S2), and the
probe intensity I = S1 + S2 for both the ampliﬁed and reference pulses respectively. From these signals, two main
quantities are formed: the asymmetry

and the optical density for the probe,

In Eq. 6,
A0 is a small background absorption due to a 6P population of known collisional origin [30]. It is measured
once at the beginning of data taking, with the excitation beam detuned a few gigahertz away from the forbidden
transition. It typically amounts to

This ratio just provides the tilt angle θ of the eigenaxes (Eq. 1) within a normalization factor close to 1 (or close to
the magniﬁcation factor when the polarization magniﬁer is used), eliminated in the calibration procedure measuring
the same quantity for the known θcal angle. Then over the 30 consecutive laser shots corresponding to a given state of
the experiment, the program estimates both the means and standard deviations of ϑ and ALR and stores them for the
purpose of later analysis. This sequence is repeated for all the states depicted in Table 1. For each reversal, the sign
1 is chosen at random. The complete signature of the APV signal involves

A second determination < Gi >θ is obtained by replacing in the above expression ALR by ϑ (Eq. 7). Both methods
give identical results. Note that an imperfect ~El reversal alone leading to an ~El-odd contribution to

either quantity, thus ensuring suppression of systematics due to ~El-misreversal. However, it can be shown that a

this particular example, we see that it is instructive to compare the results obtained with both methods. From the

III. This constitutes a so-called run #k, providing us with an ensemble of Nk = 2Niso PV data. From this ensemble,
we deduce an average value mk and the standard error σk. The average mk represents the calibrated tilt angle of
the gain axes having the complete PV signature deﬁned in Table 1, i.e. θpv
exp. We accumulated typically 30 such runs
using a given cell. The run results are merged with weights 1/σ2
k to give a single result per cell. Alternatively, the Nk
individual PV data of all runs of all cells are merged into a single ensemble, the same weight being attributed to any
individual datum. The results are presented and compared in Sect. V D.

Besides the PV quantities, several other quantities bearing non-PV signatures are constructed from the polarimeter
signals, providing us on a short time-scale with a wealth of information making possible real-time corrections for
defects or drifts during lengthy data acquisition. The most important of these are:

B. Noise peak rejection and test of PV data rejection

The aim of noise peak rejection aims is to discard accidental outlying data without truncating the noise distribution.
If the standard deviation of the atomic imbalance σDat , estimated in one state of the experiment (i.e. over 30 laser
shots), happens to exceed three times its typical value, the corresponding measurement is ignored and immediately
repeated before the next parameter reversal is performed. Under normal conditions, such an event occurs with a
probability of only a fraction of a percent.
In a few cases, this precaution proved useful to eliminate noise not
continuously present, but possibly associated with the electric ﬁeld shots.

In diﬀered analysis, we eliminate outlying PV data by self consistent truncation at three standard deviations on the
1%,
distribution of the PV data accumulated in a given tilt of the cell. The number of rejected data is negligible (
10−3). This test was also performed
barely larger than what is expected for a standard gaussian distribution, 2.6
over the distributions of PV data at the various stages of the analysis, i.e. over the runs in a given cell and over all
data merged together.

C. Test of Isotropy

The two values of the isotropic part of the El-odd linear dichroism, Sxy and Suv, that we extract in each four-
polarization cycle are found compatible within the noise level, as one expects from considerations of the symmetry of
the Stark dipole of the excitation transition [19]. This is observed on individual runs but it is also conﬁrmed by the

for both “class1” and “class 2” systematics is expected to show up as non-zero diﬀerences Dxy = 1
Gy) and
Duv = 1
Gv). The isotropy test consists in plotting one point of coordinates (Dxy, Duv) per data set in a
cartesian coordinate system. In conditions of perfect isotropy, the center of gravity of the cloud of points should
merge into the origin within the error bars. In [19] we presented a set of data presenting no signiﬁcant isotropy. Here,
we present (Fig. 10) another set (1126 data points obtained in cell #4) analyzed separately for the two opposite
signs of the tilt. The anisotropy is clearly apparent in each tilt, with Dxy signals of opposite signs. It is reduced over
the whole data set. By contrast, the isotropic contributions in both tilts are statistically compatible. In other words
Dxy appears much more sensitive than Sxy or Suv to the anisotropy induced by the tilt. Referring to [19], we expect
the tilt of the cell to give rise to eﬀects of both “class 1” and “class 2”, but for a tilt ψx (ı.e. a rotation around ˆy),
“class 1” eﬀects would contribute to both Dxy and the isotropic parts, Sxy and Suv, with comparable magnitudes (see
Eqs. 35, 37, 39 40 in [19]). On the other hand, tilt-dependent “class 2” eﬀects cancel out in Sxy and Suv, but can
contribute to both Dxy and Duv. On this particular data set, we interpret the value of Duv remaining after averaging
over the two tilts (Fig. 10, right graph) by the presence of a tilt ψy, exceptionally present and unmodiﬁed during
the ψx/
ψx reversal. Therefore, this signal is a useful warning but not the sign of a systematic eﬀect. Moreover,
when the isotropy test is performed on the whole data set, from one cell to another residual anisotropies tend to
compensate. This means that their principal origin is not in the optical components of the set-up but rather arises
from slight residual imperfections occuring either during the mounting of each cell inside the electrode assembly or
during the fabrication of each individual cell. However, as shown by the ﬁnal results and the discussion presented,
hereafter there is at present no hint of any signiﬁcant residual systematic eﬀect varying from one cell to the next.

D. Measurement of ~El and θcal for calibrating θpv

1. A precise in situ measurement of ~El

To take advantage of the substantial reduction achieved in the statistical uncertainty (see Sect. IV F), we were
obliged to reduce also the uncertainty on the magnitude El of the ﬁeld inside the cell, this value being required for
a comparison of experiment with theory. For this purpose we changed our calibration method [10]. It can now be
conducted in the exact conditions of PV data acquisition: same hyperﬁne probe transition, excitation energy and
applied potentials. It provides us with reliable results to within a one percent accuracy.

The basic idea relies on the comparison of two optical densities of the vapor at the probe wavelength, the ﬁrst
without any applied electric ﬁeld and the second in the longitudinal ﬁeld of magnitude El to be measured. They are
both proportional to the number of atoms excited in the 7S state, hence to the excitation probability, respectively

asymmetry ALR that is associated with the 7S atomic alignment arising from a tilt θ of ˆǫex with respect to ˆǫpr, (i.e.
similar to the calibration signal used for data acquisition). The relation connecting the optical density to ALR can be
established precisely by relying on theory [16].

from a numerical solution of the exact equations derived in [16] (see Appendix B), using eﬃcient subroutines provided
by Mathematica [42].

did previously [10], corresponds to a real improvement. In addition, for the linear dichroism signal detected on the
6P3/2,F =4 transition, our experimental results conﬁrm that saturation eﬀects are especially weak,

For practical reasons, for the zero-ﬁeld measurements (weak optical density), we adjust ˆǫex at 45◦ from ˆǫpr to detect
the maximum value of the asymmetry, ALR = η⊥A⊥, while in the El ﬁeld measurement ˆǫex deviates from ~El ∧

by a small known angle, θ = 12.41
ratio to be measured is of order 70, even though the optial densities diﬀer by a factor of
2000. In this way, we
completely avoid possible non-linearity problems in the detection chain. To eliminate saturation eﬀects, measurements
are performed at diﬀerent levels of the probe beam intensity to allow for an extrapolation to zero intensity, both with
and without the applied electric ﬁeld since saturation eﬀects depend on the ampliﬁcation level. The ﬁeld magnitude
is then determined using:

Here ǫ is the small quantity expressing the deviation of the exact result with respect to the simple one assuming an
A⊥(El) depending on the value taken by the parameter γdtp. For
exponential-type ampliﬁcation; it is a function of
A⊥(El) = 0.68, we obtain ǫ = 0.100. The precision in ǫ is limited by
example for the realistic values γdtp = 1.49, and
the uncertainty on γd, itself a linear function of the cesium atomic density [43]. Allowing for 5% uncertainty on this
latter, hence 3% one on γd, the resulting uncertainty on Eexp
is 0.3%. In practical conditions, the precision in El is
l
that of the measurements, presently better than 1%. The determination of El by this method has been performed in
the two types of Cs cells leading to the results discussed in Sect. III E. In both cases the uncertainty on El is small
in comparison with the statistical uncertainty on θpv

exp.

2. Calibration of the tilt angles provided by the Faraday rotator

Our measurements of θpv as well as those of the electric ﬁeld suppose a precise knowledge of the tilt angles realized
by the Faraday rotator in terms of the applied current. Therefore, the calibration of the modulation angle versus
the applied Faraday current was repeated several times during the course of our PV measurements. It is done by
measuring the mechanical rotation of a Glan prism assembled on a precisely graduated mount which compensates the
Faraday rotation. The precision of this calibration, 0.5 %, could be improved if need be.

weight. Since all the measurements were not performed at the same applied potential diﬀerence but most of them at
a voltage 5% lower, we have made the appropriate correction for renormalizing all results at the same nominal value
of El, that of ref [10], 1619 V/cm. The SNR improvement from the ﬁrst to the last cell is made conspicuous in Fig. 12

indicates that possible defects, associated with the preparation of the cells (their geometry and surface properties
[44], the ﬁlling procedure, etc...) have no detectable eﬀect on our results. Indeed, all the cells were not made of
exactly the same material, sapphire/alumina, nor was the machining process identical. All cells had their windows
3 mrad towards the
precisely mounted, normal to the tube except cell # 2 whose windows were tilted at + 3 and
horizontal. This allowed us to align ~El precisely along the beam direction (see Sect. III D 2) though this did not
provide convincing advantages. Possible presence of foreign gas was tested by looking for a broadening of the saturated
absorption spectrum of the D2 resonance line on an auxiliary set-up. Only in cell # 3 could it be observed. This
might explain the presence of an unusual short-term noise in this cell, which was rapidly discarded. Note, however,
that the value of θpv

VI. RELEVANCE OF ATOMIC PARITY VIOLATION. CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS

A. Goals for further APV measurements

The main goal of atomic parity violation (APV) is to provide a determination of the weak nuclear charge QW ,
from the measurement of Epv
via an atomic physics calculation which now aims at 0.1% precision [45]. In view of
1
present and forthcoming results from high energy experiments, an important issue concerns the relevance of further
improving diﬃcult experiments such as APV measurements. We would like to present arguments in favor of small
scale APV experiments.

•

First we wish to reiterate that APV experiments explore the electroweak (EW) electron-hadron interaction
within a range of low momentum transfers qat of 1 MeV or thereabouts in Cesium, which compares with the
huge ones explored in collider experiments: 100 GeV at LEP I and LEP II and 1 TeV at LHC [46]. At low
energies, the electroweak amplitude is of the order of e2q2
W . In order to compensate for this exceeding small

measurement of a radiative atomic transition LR asymmetry.

broken into their fundamental constituants: the quarks act then incoherently. This is what happens in deep
inelastic electron-nucleon scattering, such as the SLAC experiment [47] involving a GeV polarized electron
beam colliding against a ﬁxed deuterium target. As a consequence, diﬀerent combinations of electron-quark PV
coupling constants are involved in the LR asymmetries of the two experiments: 2

models which aﬀect EW interactions at energies higher than MZ0 c2 through the existence of gauge bosons

that ∆QW is proportional to the same factor X = π

below the 0.1 % level of precision would give constraints on Rk, competitive with those of LEP II [49, 50, 51].
Furthermore, one can consider models which predict eﬀects undetectable by LEP II results but that would be
visible in APV experiments [49, 52]. Therefore, a 0.1% accurate QW determination could allow one to impose

more precisely with a mass in the range of a few MeV. Such a drastic modiﬁcation of EW interactions appears
as an alternative explanation for the remarkably intense and narrow gamma ray line emitted from the bulge of
our galaxy, close to the energy of 511 keV which coincides with the electron mass [53, 54]. According to this
somewhat exotic model, the observed spectrum would result from the annihilation of two light dark matter
1-2 MeV) into a pair (e+, e−) via the exchange of a light gauge boson U, with a mass of about
particles (mass
10 MeV [55]. In order to reproduce the size of the eﬀects observed experimentally, one has to exclude at a large
conﬁdence level an axial coupling of the electrons to the new U boson, while such a coupling is the only possible
one for dark particles which carry no charge. This is where APV comes into play.
The most plausible conclusion to which the present value of ∆QW leads [4] is that the U boson couples to the
electron as a vector particle with no axial coupling at the 10−6 level, while its vector coupling to leptons and
quarks are of the same order of magnitude [56]. Thus, the APV measurements provide an empirical justiﬁcation
for a key hypothesis, introduced in the astrophysical model accounting for the 511 keV galactic line.

B. Conclusion and Prospects

Our experiment has provided yet another method to measure atomic parity violation in a highly forbidden transition.
In the ﬁrst Cs experiment [5], the signal detected was the circularly polarized ﬂuorescence intensity emitted on the
6P1/2 transition. In an early version of their experiment [57], the Boulder group detected the total ﬂuorescence
7S1/2 −
intensity emitted in the second step of the 7S
6S cascade. In their ﬁnal measurements [7], they operated
with an atomic beam optically pumped in one hyperﬁne state. They detected, by scattering of resonance photons,
the population of the second hyperﬁne ground state resulting from excitation of the forbidden transition followed by
cascade deexcitation. However, this signal was superimposed on a background (
25%) arising from stray resonant
light. In all cases, the LR asymmetry was ﬁnally observed via ﬂuorescence photons and directly given by the ratio

Our new method exploits the ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of a resonant probe beam passing through the
vapor along the path of the excitation beam for the short time during which the 7S atoms have not yet decayed.
The polarization of the probe is modiﬁed during this propagation in a way which reveals the parity violating LR
asymmetry, the key-point being that during the propagation of the probe beam through the vapor the LR asymmetry
itself is ampliﬁed exponentially. Consequently, the measured asymmetry is no longer inversely proportional to the
applied electric ﬁeld, but rather an increasing function of it. Moreover, the detected, diﬀerential, signal is directly the
LR asymmetry with no background.

During the course of the work presented here, starting from the preliminary results which validated the method [10],
we have succeeded in improving the SNR by a factor of 3.5. Our present result, still in agreement with the Boulder

22

result, has now reached a relative accuracy on ImEpv
10−8. We

have described the main modiﬁcations of the apparatus that contributed to this gain in sensitivity. We have also
shown how we can maintain good control of the systematic eﬀects: by making frequent measurements of the Bz ﬁeld
odd under ~El reversal, and of the transverse ~Et and ~Bt ﬁelds and by suppressing the eﬀect of the tilt of the cell with
respect to the common beam axis. In addition, data analysis provides for conﬁdence tests of the results. Of particular
relevance is the compatibility of the results obtained in seven diﬀerent cells which gives a rather good guarantee
against systematic eﬀects arising from cell preparation, prone to variations from one cell to another.

7S forbidden transition,

To interpret our data, we measured the electric ﬁeld experienced by the atoms inside the cell. To this end, we have
performed the detection of the 7S state alignment in absence of any electric ﬁeld arising from the magnetic dipole
contribution to the 6S
1 , an eﬀect unobserved heretofore. Since the detection of an
alignment relies on the existence of hyperﬁne coupling in the two atomic states connected by the probe transition (the
alignment signal cancels out without this coupling), it is free of collisional background and molecular contribution
and still more speciﬁc to the forbidden transition than an orientation signal is. Therefore, it oﬀers a nice way for
extracting El from the alignment ratio (βEl/M1)2 observed with and without the ﬁeld to be measured. However,
caution was needed to incorporate in the signal analysis existing deviations with respect to a pure exponential-type
ampliﬁcation process.

We ﬁnd it remarkable that results of APV experiments that involve scattering photons, of only 3.8 eV, by a sample
of a few cubic centimeters of dilute atomic vapor, can stand comparison with experiments performed in colliders of
the highest energy, for providing a lower limit on the mass of a hypothetical additional neutral boson. In view of the
present need for further measurements, underlined above, there are strong incentives to pursue APV measurements
exploiting stimulated-emission detection:

•

1- Given the diﬃcult task of controlling and measuring systematic eﬀects by the Boulder group [7, 18], a cross-
check at the 1% level (i.e. 2 σ) of the 0.5% Boulder result for the 133Cs 6SF =3 →
7SF =4 line by an independent
method would constitute a valuable result. Such accuracy is now within reach with our set-up, even if no further SNR
improvement were obtained.

•

2- As shown in a recent paper [38], asymmetry ampliﬁcation can provide a considerable enhancement factor in a
transverse ﬁeld conﬁguration and a longer interaction length. A cell with special multi-electrode design could ”restore
cylindrical symmetry”, despite the application of a transverse ~E ﬁeld. Then in a quantum noise limited measurement
a 0.1% statistical precision would be achievable. Increasing further the probe optical gain would seem to be limited
by the onset of spontaneous superradiance, but triggered superradiance on the other hand would come into play as a
unique tool for even larger ampliﬁcation of the asymmetry and possibly even better precision. The motivation for this
project, which looks feasible, is encouraged by the considerable eﬀorts undertaken by atomic theoretical physicists to
arrive at 0.1% accuracy in their many-body perturbation theory calculations [45].

•

3- In a cell experiment the required cesium quantity is very small, of order a few milligrams, i.e. several orders
of magnitude smaller than the required quantity in an eﬀusive beam APV experiment [18]. This opens the possibility
of an APV measurement with 135Cs, a radioactive isotope with a long half lifetime (3 million years). A quantity of
1 mg of 135Cs corresponds to an activity of approximately 4
1 µCi), so that necessary radioprotection
measures should not preclude the feasibility of such an experiment. Measuring APV with two diﬀerent isotopes, such
as 135Cs and 133Cs would provide the very ﬁrst experimental test of the nuclear weak charge dependence on the
neutron number. Since the uncertainty resulting from the neutron distribution is expected to be less than 0.1 % in
cesium [58], the isotopic dependence would oﬀer an alternative interesting way of testing the Standard Model [59].
4- An independent measurement of the nuclear anapole moment, obtained from the diﬀerence of the Epv

1 de-
terminations on two diﬀerent hyperﬁne 6S
7S lines today looks particularly necessary in view of the apparent
inconsistency of the Boulder result [4, 9] with other data relating to parity-violating nuclear forces. There exists a
long-term project aiming at a direct measurement of the nuclear anapole moment by searching for a linear Stark shift
of alkali atoms trapped in a cristalline helium matrix of hexagonal symmetry [60]. Even so, today our experiment has
already reached a level of sensitivity such that pursuing this goal on the Cs 6S

7S transition appears achievable.

[30] There are several mechanisms for the direct excitation of a 6P population by the excitation pulse. In the present operating
conditions (reduction of the dimer density thanks to a high body temperature of the cell, short excitation-probe delay and
large excitation energy ∼ 1.8 mJ), the dominant mechanism is attributable to 6S − 6P Frank-Hertz collisional excitation
by the photoelectrons emitted by the “cathode” window and accelerated by the applied longitudinal electric ﬁeld.

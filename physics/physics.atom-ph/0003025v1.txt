ABSTRACT

Generalized oscillator strengths (GOS’s) for the Na 3s−3p transition have

been investigated using the spin-polarized technique of the random phase ap-

proximation with exchange (RPAE) and the ﬁrst Born approximation (FBA),

focussing our attention on the position of the minimum. Intershell correla-

tions are found to inﬂuence the position of the minimum signiﬁcantly, but

hardly that of the maximum. The RPAE calculation predicts for the ﬁrst

time the positions of the minimum and maximum at momentum transfer, K

values of 1.258 a.u. and 1.61 a.u., respectively. The former value is within the

range of values extracted from experimental measurements, K = 1.0 − 1.67

a.u.. We recommend careful experimental search for the minimum around

the predicted value for conﬁrmation.

1 Introduction

The generalized oscillator strength(GOS) is an important property of the

atom, since Bethe introduced it [1]. To study this property, the sodium

atom has been chosen as the subject in many experimental and theoretical

investigations because its electronic conﬁguration has an inert core and a

single valence electron which is similar to that of the hydrogen atom. The

diﬀerential cross sections (DCS’s) and GOS’s for the Na 3s − 3p transition

were measured by Shuttleworth at al [2] using a high-resolution electron

spectrometer over the angular range of 1◦-20◦ at the incident electron energies

of 54.4, 100, 150 and 250 eV. The measurement observed a GOS minimum

at the momentum transfer value of K = 0.67 a.u.

(or K 2 = 0.45 a.u.).

Buckman and Teubner [3] measured data for the same transition using a

modulated crossed-beam technique at the incident energies of 54.4 , 100 ,

150 and 217.7 eV, covering the extended angular range of 2◦ to 145◦. Their

data are in good agreement with those of Shuttleworth et al at small angles

but did not show a GOS minimum around K 2 = 0.45 a.u..

The Shuttleworth’s et al minimum was also not conﬁrmed by the ex-

periment of Srivastava and Vuskovic [4], which utilized a crossed-electron

-beam-metal-atom-beam scattering technique and performed measurements

at incident energies of 10, 20, 40, and 54.4 eV. The data of Srivastava and

Vuskovic are in poor agreement with those of Buckman and Teubner at large

1

angles. Srivastava and Vuskovic implied that the conﬂict was caused by

the inproper geometrical correction factor in Buckman and Teubner’s exper-

iment. To resolve the discrepancy Teubner et al [5] remeasured the Na 3s−3p

transition at 22.1 and 54.4 eV and found a probable source of systematic er-

ror in the measurement of Srivastava and Vuskovic. All the measurements

did not observe the GOS minimum around K = 0.67 a.u. as predicted by

Shuttleworth et al. Some recent measurements on the Na 3s − 3p transition

by Bielschowsky et al [6] at impact energy of 1 keV and Marinkovic et al [7]

at 10, 20 and 54.4 eV did not report GOS minima in the momentum transfer

regions they considered.

Theoretically, Shimamura [8] predicted GOS minima to appear between

K 2 = 0.72 and 0.93 a.u., depending on the choice of the exponent in the

Slater orbitals. Miller [9] calculated the GOS minimum in the Na 3s − 3p

transition within the FBA, employing hydrogenlike orbitals with eﬀective

nuclear charge and predicted a minimum at K 2 = 0.71 a.u.. The FBA

calculation from Bielschowsky et al showed a minimum around K 2 = 2.0

a.u.. In summary the GOS minimum for the Na 3s − 3p transition observed

in Shuttleworth’s et al experiment was not conﬁrmed by other measurements.

Also, the wide range of positions of the minimum predicted by the theoretical

calculations at K 2 = 0.71, 0.72, 0.93 and 2.0 a.u. are not observed by the

experments. Obviously, the GOS and the position of its minimum for the Na

2

3s − 3p transition is still an unresolved and interesting problem.

In this paper we have used the spin-polarized technique of the random

phase approximation with exchange(RPAE) to investigate the GOS for the

Na 3s − 3p transition. The major objective of our calculation has been the

unambiguous identiﬁcation and location of the positions of the minimum

and maximum. As a result, values of K were carefully selected. We found

for the ﬁrst time the positions of the minimum and the maximum to be

at around K = 1.258 a.u. (or K 2 = 1.582 a.u.) and K = 1.61 a.u. (or

K 2 = 2.59 a.u.), respectively. After careful analysis of the experimental data,

we found the GOS minimum at K = 1.258 a.u. is supported by some previous

measurements. The intershell correlations are found to have signiﬁcant eﬀect

to the position of the minimum.

2 THEORY

In the FBA the generalized oscillator strength, f, for dipole allowed transi-

tions in the length form can be calculated [10] as

f =

2(2l + 1)Nlw
(2li + 1)K 2 |dα|2

(1)

where Nl is the number of electrons in the excited state, li is the initial orbital

angular momentum of the excited electron, l is the total angular momentum

of the electron-hole pair, which satisﬁes triangle rule |lf + li| > l > |li − lf |,

3

w is the excitation energy (a.u.). The dipole matrix element, dα can be

calculated from

< φf |dα|φi >= q(2li + 1)(2lf + 1)


lf l li

0 0 0

Z ∞

0




Pi(r)Pf (r)jl(Kr)dr

(2)

where Pi(r), Pf (r) are the radial wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal states,

respectively, jl(Kr) is the spherical Bessel function. For the dipole allowed

transition, the calculations performed in this paper are with l = 1 and

Pi(r), Pf (r) represented by Hartree-Fock wave functions. Each channel, such

as s − p transition, includes three discrete excited states, 3p, 4p, 5p, and sev-

enteen continuum states. The radial part of the wave function for each state

was represented by 700 points.

According to the semiempirical Hund rule, the total spin of a shell in

the ground state reaches the largest value permitted by the Pauli principle.

Therefore, in the semiclosed shell all the electron spin vectors are collinear,

and their projections on to an arbitrary ﬁxed direction are equal. Therefore,

every shell can be devided into two spin subshells, each having a certain spin

direction, ↑ or ↓. Because of this the wave functions double. Electrons in the

subshell interact with other electrons in two diﬀerent ways, with or without

exchange. Since the Coulomb interaction will not change the spin direction,

only the electrons having the same spin direction can interact with exchange.

The equation for the dipole matrix element in the spin-polarized technique

of the RPAE [11] is

α represents the am-

plitude for the direct excitation of 3s↑ − 3p↑ and χα′ is the electron-vacancy

propagator. If the states of ↑ and ↓ electron are equivalent, the dipole matrix

element D↑

α in the RPAE for the 3s↑ − 3p↑ transition can be obtained from

< ǫf |D↑

α|ǫi > = < ǫf |d↑

α|ǫ3 >< ǫ3ǫf |u↑↑,↑↓, |ǫ4ǫi >

< ǫ4|D↑

w − ǫ4 + ǫ3 + iη(1 − 2n4)

)

(4)

where ǫ3 and ǫ4 represent the virtual excitation states, iη gives the direction

of tracing the pole while integrating over the energy, η → +0, F is the

Fermi energy of the atom, and n4 is the Fermi step: n4 = 1, ǫ4 ≤ F ; n4 = 0,

ǫ4 > F . The symbol P denotes summation over discrete and integration over
α of the 3s↓ − 3p↓ transition
continuous states. A similar equation for the D↓

can be obtained. It is important to remember that only the states with the

same spin direction can have exchange interaction in the sum of Eq. (4).

Finally, the GOS for Na 3s − 3p transition can be written as

f =

2(2l + 1)Nlw
(2li + 1)K 2 (D↑

Eqs. (1),(2),(4) and (5) are the basic equations used in this paper to calculate

the GOS’s in FBA and RPAE.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results of our calculation are given in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Table 1. Table

1 lists the positions of the minimum and maximum for the Na 3s − 3p tran-

sition obtained by diﬀerent authors. The results of our FBA calculation are

in excellent agreement with that of Bielschowsky et al. The data of Shuttle-

worth et al showed a GOS minimum around K = 0.67 a.u.. However, this

minimum was not observed in all other measurements. After analyzing the

experimental data obtained by Shuttleworth et al [2], Buckman and Teub-

ner [3], Srivastava and Vuskovic [4], Teubner et al [5], and Marinkovic et al

[7], we found that the GOS minima from the experimental data are around

K = 1.0 − 1.67 a.u. (or K 2 = 1.0 − 2.80 a.u.) at impact energies of 20 and

54.4 eV. These minima were not originally noticed by the experimentlists.

The circles are from Srivastava and Vuskovic, black dots are from Marinkovic

et al, and squares are from Teubner et al . The solid and dotted lines represent

our RPAE and FBA calculations, respectively. All three measurements show

the GOS minimum around K = 1.0 − 1.18 a.u. (or K 2 = 1.0 − 1.39 a.u.)

which are close to our results.

Fig. 2 is the same as Fig.1, except that the data are at 54.4 eV and

the crosses are from Buckman and Teubner and the triangles are from Shut-

9

tleworth et al. The black dots and circles show the GOS minimum around

K = 1.67 a.u. (or K 2 = 2.80 a.u.), while the crosses give a minimum at

K = 1.51 a.u. (or K 2 = 2.29 a.u.). Since the position of the GOS min-

imum for the Na 3s − 3p transition occurs at large momentum transfer,

K = 1.0 − 1.67 a.u., which corresponds to large angles in the measurements;

for example θ = 37◦ at the impact energy of 54.4 eV(K = 1.258 a.u.). There-

fore it is easy to miss the GOS minimum in the measurement by taking large

angular steps at large angles as is the usuall practice. From our calculation

it is suggested to reperform the experiment for Na 3s − 3p transition and pay

particular attention to the position of the minimum we indicated in Table 1.

We believe more experimental data will be obtained to conﬁrm our results.

It is interesting to compare the intershell correlations for the transitions

between the Na 3s − 3p and the Ar 3p − 4s. The position of the GOS mini-

mum for the later is inﬂuenced insigniﬁcantly by correlations. The diﬀerence

between positions of the minimum from the RPAE and FBA is less than

0.7%. However, in the Na 3s − 3p transition the diﬀerence is more than 11%.

This is because the Na 3p level is only 2.1 eV above the 3s ground state;

therefore Na has an enormous dipole polarizability (23.6 × 10−24cm3).

In

RPAE the many-electron correlation eﬀects are essentially due to polariza-

tion of the electron shell by the external ﬁeld. Results from RPAE will show

a signiﬁcant diﬀerence from that of FBA if the atoms have large polarizabil-

10

ity. Therefore, we can expect that Li, K and Rb atoms will yield results that

are similar to those of Na, while Ne, Kr and Xe atoms will exhibit results

similar to those of Ar if we compare the positions of GOS minimum from

RPAE and FBA.

Correlations between intershell electrons are strongly aﬀected by the

separation of the subshells. The 3s ↑ −3p ↑ excitation energy will be

0.07267(a.u.), 0.07255(a.u.), 0.07190(a.u.), and 0.07175 (a.u.)

if channels

(s↑ − p↑), (s↑ − p↑ + p↑ − s↑ + p↓ − s↓), (s↑ − p↑ + p↑ − d↑ + p↓ − d↓) and

(s↑ − p↑ + p↑ − d↑ + p↓ − d↓ + p↑ − s↑ + p↓ − s↓) are included in the RPAE

calculations. This indicates that the inﬂuence of the 3d↑↓ electrons upon the

3p ↑ electron is larger than that from the 4s↑↓ electrons.

In conclusion, the positions of the minimum and the maximum for the

Na 3s − 3p transition have been calculated and found for the ﬁrst time from

RPAE at the momentum transfer values of K = 1.258 a.u. and 1.61 a.u.,

respectively. Furthermore, the many-electron correlations are found to play

an important role in the determination of the position of the minimum. We

recommend that experiments search carefully for predicted minimum, using

the value obtain here as a guide.

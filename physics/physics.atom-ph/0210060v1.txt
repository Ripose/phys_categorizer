(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We have constructed a magneto-optical trap (MOT) for metastable triplet helium atoms utilizing
the 2 3S1 → 3 3P2 line at 389 nm as the trapping and cooling transition. The far-red-detuned MOT
−3)
(detuning ∆ = −41 MHz) typically contains few times 107 atoms at a relatively high (∼ 109 cm
density, which is a consequence of the large momentum transfer per photon at 389 nm and a small
two-body loss rate coeﬃcient (2 × 10−10 cm3/s < β < 1.0 × 10−9 cm3/s). The two-body loss rate is
more than ﬁve times smaller than in a MOT on the commonly used 2 3S1 → 2 3P2 line at 1083 nm.
Furthermore, we measure a temperature of 0.46(1) mK, a factor 2.5 lower as compared to the 1083
nm case. Decreasing the detuning to ∆ = −9 MHz results in a cloud temperature as low as 0.25(1)
mK, at small number of trapped atoms. The 389 nm MOT exhibits small losses due to two-photon
ionization, which have been investigated as well.

INTRODUCTION

A magneto-optical trap (MOT) is a standard tool in
the production of cold atomic gases, allowing investiga-
tion of cold-collision phenomena [1] as well as the re-
alization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in alkali
species [2] and, more recently, in metastable triplet he-
lium (He*) [3, 4]. He* has a high (19.8 eV) internal en-
ergy, which allows for real-time diagnostics and increased
sensitivity in BEC probing. Unfortunately, the high in-
ternal energy also introduces strong Penning ionization
losses in magneto-optically trapped atomic clouds, which
imposes limits on the maximum achievable density. The
two-body loss rate coeﬃcient related to this process is
10−9 cm3/s for a MOT on the 2 3S1
2 3P2
about 5
transition at 1083 nm [5], which is about two orders
of magnitude larger than the loss rate coeﬃcient in a
standard alkali MOT. In BEC experiments, the MOT is
used as a bright source of cold atoms to load a magnetic
trap with large numbers of atoms. Moreover, as a start-
ing point for evaporative cooling a dense magnetostati-
cally trapped cloud is desired. So ideally, the magneto-
optically trapped cloud must provide this high density. In
the present work, we explore the feasibility and possible
advantages of a MOT using the 2 3S1
3 3P2 transition

Although the 389 nm transition was used recently
in laser cooling experiments [6], it has not found wide
application yet. This mainly relates to the fact that
10% of the 3 3P2 population decays via the 3 3S1 state
(Fig. 1), making a closed laser cooling transition be-
tween magnetic substates impossible.
In addition, the
shorter 389 nm wavelength leads, in combination with
a linewidth Γ/2π = 1.5 MHz [7], to a relatively high

saturation intensity I0 = 3.31 mW/cm
(circular po-
larization in an optically pumped environment [8]). In
comparison, the 2 3S1
2 3P2 transition at 1083 nm
has almost the same linewidth but a saturation inten-
sity of only 0.17 mW/cm
. To maximize the number of
trapped atoms, dedicated metastable helium magneto-
optical traps are operated at large detuning and inten-
sity [5, 9, 10]. This implies the need for a high-power laser
setup. Nevertheless, the concept of a 389 nm magneto-
optical trap is appealing. An attractive feature of the
389 nm transition is the momentum transfer per pho-
ton, which is 2.8 times larger than for 1083 nm photons.
Since both transitions have nearly equal linewidths, the
spontaneous cooling force increases proportional to the
photon momentum. This opens the possibility to com-
press the cloud substantially in comparison to a 1083 nm
MOT at the same detuning and power. Unfortunately,
compression may lead to increased losses predominantly
due to light-assisted two-body collisions. The two-body
loss rate coeﬃcient for the 389 nm situation is, however,
unknown.
In case of a relatively low rate coeﬃcient,
the cloud may be compressed without loss of too many
metastables. Furthermore, it should be noted that the
1083 nm and 389 nm transitions are electronically alike,
which greatly facilitates the comparison between the two
MOT types. Finally, the 389 nm MOT diﬀers from the
1083 nm MOT in yet another respect: two 389 nm pho-
tons contain suﬃcient energy to ionize an atom in the
2 3S1 state. This may introduce observable additional
losses.

In this article, we report on the study of a prototype
389 nm MOT. In Sec. II we present some typical aspects
of the 389 nm MOT from general laser cooling theory.
Next, we outline our experimental setup in Sec. III. Re-
sults are given in Sec. IV. Conclusive remarks and an
outlook are presented in Sec. V.

II. QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE 389
NM MOT

A. Spring constant and damping coeﬃcient

The large Doppler cooling force modiﬁes the equilib-
rium conditions in a 389 nm MOT with respect to the
1083 nm situation. This follows from regarding the mo-
tion of an atom, trapped in a one-dimensional MOT, as
an overdamped harmonic oscillation [11, 12]. The oscil-
lation frequency ωosc and damping coeﬃcient ǫd are, for
small velocities and small deviations from trap center,
given by

with k the wavenumber of the MOT laser light, m the
atomic mass, δ = 2π∆/Γ with ∆ the laser detuning from
resonance in MHz, S = I/I0 the saturation parameter,
with I the intensity per MOT beam, and ζ representing
the spatial derivative of the location-dependent Zeeman
detuning. The harmonic oscillator frequency is related
to the spring constant κ via ω2
osc = κ/m. Two general
diﬀerences between the 389 nm and 1083 nm MOT fol-
low immediately from Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). First, bearing
1083/389, it is obvious that
in mind that k389 = k1083

×

2

for equal saturation parameter and detuning the damp-
ing coeﬃcient increases by a factor 7.8 as compared to a
1083 nm MOT. Although this does not alter the temper-
ature in the MOT, which does not depend on wavelength
and is expected to be almost equal for the two cases, the
damping time τ is shortened to 0.13τ1083 [11]. Second,
and under the same assumptions for the MOT param-
eters, the spring constant is increased by a factor 2.8.
This has implications for the size of the trapped cloud,
which is determined by the equipartition of potential and
kinetic energy. The volume V of the cloud is (following
the deﬁnition of V as given in Sec. III C 2)

V =

2πkBT

(cid:18)

κ (cid:19)

3/2

,

(3)

where for simplicity we have assumed an isotropic 3D
harmonic oscillator (kB is Boltzmann’s constant). It fol-
lows that the volume decreases by a factor 4.5, i.e. the
cloud is compressed with respect to the 1083 nm situa-
tion.

B. Loading the MOT

All magnetic substates participate in the atom-laser
interaction, since the magneto-optically trapped cloud
is contained at low magnetic ﬁeld strengths and irradi-
ated from six directions with circularly polarized light.
Therefore, the presence of the second decay channel of
the 3 3P2 state will not limit operation of the MOT, as
long as there is loading of atoms from the outer regions
of the MOT volume. Loading, however, may be frus-
trated by the nonclosed cycling transition as well as by
the relatively large Doppler shift. More speciﬁcally, the
question arises whether the slowing process of atoms en-
tering the MOT volume can be completed before a spon-
taneous emission via the 3 3S1 cascade takes the atom
to a diﬀerent, nonresonant magnetic substate.
If not,
the atom needs to be repumped to the cycling transi-
tion; otherwise it will escape from the MOT volume.
In order to answer this question, and to obtain a gen-
eral notion of the loading process and its dependence
on the MOT parameters, we employ a simple 1D model
for an atom traversing the MOT volume. We calculate
the instantaneous photon scattering rate for atoms at a
given velocity v, interacting with a counterpropagating,
red-detuned laser beam at 389 nm inducing σ+ transi-
tions. This laser beam represents the two MOT laser
beams counterpropagating the atomic beam at angles of
45◦ with respect to the atomic beam (see Sec. III A).
±
We assume the atoms to be predecelerated by a Zeeman
slower, so that we can choose any initial velocity. We
take Zeeman detuning, laser intensity, and Doppler shift
into account, the latter of which is taken to be kv/√2 to
45◦ angle between the atom and (real)
correct for the
laser beams. Furthermore, we consider all three σ+ tran-

First, we use this model to investigate the capture
of atoms, emerging from the Zeeman slower in the
2 3S1, M = +1 state with a velocity v = 75 m/s. We
35 MHz, an intensity of
choose a MOT detuning of
30I0, and a magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 20 G/cm. These
conditions are typical for a 1083 nm MOT. The model
shows that the resonance condition is never fulﬁlled in-
side the MOT volume, thus preventing any loading of
atoms. Next, we lower v to 35 m/s. We observe that the
atoms now interact strongly with the laser light within
the MOT volume (see Fig. 2b). However, the peaks in
the scattering rate of the diﬀerent σ+ transitions hardly
overlap in space, as a result of their diﬀerent Zeeman
detunings. Slowing these atoms down to zero velocity re-
quires about 190 absorption-emission cycles, whereas it
takes about 20 cycles (corresponding to a velocity reduc-
tion of only 4 m/s) for the atom to end up in one of the
nonabsorbing (M =
1 or M = 0) states. Consequently,
the capture process is interrupted. Before this M -state
atom becomes suﬃciently resonant again, such that it is
optically pumped back to the M = +1 state, it will have
travelled out of resonance with the cycling transition and
can no longer be captured by the MOT. Only for veloci-
ties v
20 m/s, an atom ending up in the wrong M state
is repumped fast enough to continue the deceleration to-
wards zero velocity (Fig. 2c). Thus we conclude that the
capture velocity of the 389 nm MOT is approximately 24
m/s. This velocity is much smaller than the
75 m/s
capture velocity of a typical 1083 nm MOT. Figure 2d
illustrates the superior loading capabilities of a 1083 nm
MOT of 15 mm radius. The smaller Doppler shift allows
for faster atoms to be captured, whereas the closed cy-
cling transition does not impose any constraints on the
magnetic ﬁeld strength. In fact, the 1083 nm MOT di-
ameter sets the maximum stopping distance, and thus
limits the capture velocity. Within the picture provided
by the model, increasing the diameter of a 389 nm MOT
will not solve the problem described above. To avoid
optical pumping to nonresonant magnetic substates in
the outer regions of the MOT, only small magnetic ﬁeld
gradients can be tolerated. Then, to maintain suﬃcient
conﬁnement of the trapped atoms, only small MOT laser
detunings are allowed, thereby limiting the capture veloc-
ity. We stress that the model is based on crude simpliﬁca-
tions and ignores important features of the MOT. For in-
stance, the orthogonal MOT laser beams, in combination
with the spatially varying, three-dimensional magnetic
ﬁeld vector induce σ as well as π transitions. Therefore,
the conditions required for repumping to the laser-cooled
state may be less stringent than predicted by our simple
model. So we conclude that a 389 nm MOT will be able
to capture suﬃciently slow metastable helium atoms.

∼

The smaller capture velocity of a 389 nm MOT is a
signiﬁcant limitation, since a helium atomic beam ex-
pands dramatically due to transverse heating during Zee-

man deceleration [13]. Calculations of the rms size of
the atomic beam along the slowing trajectory show an
increase of the rms atomic beam diameter by a factor
1.7 when tuning the end velocity from 75 m/s down to
25 m/s. This may lead to a decrease of a factor 3 in
metastable ﬂux. In conjunction with the limited MOT
volume, this inevitably will result in a reduced loading
rate.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. Atomic beam apparatus

∼

−

The ﬁrst stage in our atomic beam apparatus involves
a liquid nitrogen cooled He* DC discharge source, pro-
ducing an atomic beam that is laser collimated using
the curved-wavefront technique. The beam source is a
copy of the source described by Rooijakkers et al. [14].
The collimated beam enters a diﬀerentially pumped two-
part Zeeman slower that reduces the longitudinal veloc-
ity from 1000 m/s to
25 m/s. 1083 nm laser light
from a commercial 2W ﬁber laser (measured bandwidth
8 MHz) is used for slowing and collimation. The laser
is stabilized to the 2 3S1
2 3P2 transition using sat-
→
urated absorption spectroscopy in an rf-discharge cell.
The
250 MHz detuning for Zeeman slowing is obtained
using an acousto-optical modulator. Downstream the
Zeeman slower the MOT vacuum chamber is located,
with 20 mm diameter laser windows for the MOT beams
(see Fig.3). Two channeltron electron multipliers are
mounted inside to separately detect ions and metasta-
bles. Both channeltrons are operated with negative high
voltage at the front end; however, one of them is put
more closely to the cloud, thereby attracting all positively
charged particles and leaving only the neutral metasta-
bles to be detected by the other. Also, the detector of
metastables is hidden behind an aperture in the wall of
the vacuum chamber (Fig. 3), which provides additional
shielding of its electric ﬁeld. Two 50 A coils, wound
around the vacuum chamber and consisting of 17 turns
copper tubing each, produce a quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld
with a gradient of 43 G/cm along the symmetry axis. The
ﬁeld of the second part of the Zeeman slower inside the
MOT region is counteracted with a compensation coil,
mounted at the position of the Zeeman slower exit. The
10−9 mbar, and in-
pressure in the MOT chamber is 2
×
10−8 mbar when the He* beam is switched
creases to 1
on.

×

To minimize atomic beam expansion at the end of the
Zeeman slower, we overlap the Zeeman slower laser beam
with an additional 1083 nm beam, with identical circu-
lar polarization and similar intensity, but diﬀerent de-
tuning (∆ =
80 MHz). By choosing the same sign of
the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld gradient along the Zeeman
slower axis as that of the Zeeman slower itself, an aux-
iliary Zeeman slowing stage only centimeters upstream
of the MOT volume is established. This should allow

trapping of atoms with velocities up to 75 m/s at the
end of the Zeeman slower. A calculation of the atomic
beam diameter for this case indicates that the loading
rate may be increased by a factor 2.4 compared to the
case where the Zeeman slower decelerates atoms to a ve-
locity of 24 m/s.

B. 389 nm Laser setup

The MOT laser light is obtained by frequency doubling
the output of a Coherent 899 Titanium:sapphire (Ti:Sa)
laser (778 nm with few-hunderd kHz bandwidth) in an
enhancement cavity containing a 10 mm Brewster-cut
LBO crystal. The cavity length is locked to the funda-
mental wavelength using the H¨ansch-Couillaud scheme.
The Ti:Sa laser is pumped by 10 W at 532 nm from a
Spectra-Physics Millennia X laser. We routinely produce
700 mW of 389 nm light; peak values of over 1 W of 389
nm at 2.1 W fundamental power have been achieved. We
measured 4% short-term (
10 ms) power ﬂuctuations in
the 389 nm output [15]. The LBO crystal is ﬂushed with
oxygen, which increases the output power by about 10%.
A small portion of the UV output is used to stabilize the
wavelength to the 2 3S1
3 3P2 transition with satu-
rated absorption spectroscopy, while Zeeman-tuning the
Lamb dip allows continuous adjustment of the detuning
between 0 and
230 MHz. A combination of cylindri-
cal and spherical lenses transforms the UV beam into a
round, parallel and approximately Gaussian beam with
8 mm waist. The beam proﬁle is truncated by a 20 mm
circular aperture, followed by a series of nonpolarizing
beamsplitters that split the UV beam into four beams.
The individual beam intensities are chosen such that
two beams in the horizontal plane can be retrorefelected,

The internal energy of helium metastables can be ex-
ploited in measuring time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectra of a
MOT. Electron multipliers directly detect part of the ex-
panding cloud after the atoms in the MOT have been
released by suddenly switching oﬀ the MOT laser, the
magnetic coils, and the slower beams. In our experiment,
operating the channeltrons in current mode yields TOF
signals resembling a Maxwell-Boltzmann atomic veloc-
ity distribution, from which we can deduce the temper-
ature and number of trapped atoms in the cloud. How-
ever, this procedure requires knowledge of the channel-
tron gain which varies with the rate of detected parti-
cles and obscures the shape of the TOF spectrum to an
unknown extent. To circumvent an elaborate calibra-
tion procedure, we count the individual metastables that
hit the channeltron. This is, using a properly set am-
pliﬁer/discriminator, not dependent on the momentary
gain. The output of the ampliﬁer/discriminator is sub-
sequently integrated by a calibrated ratemeter. In this
way we obtain the total number of detected metastables
during the TOF. Knowing the solid angle covered by the
detection area, the accuracy in the number of trapped
atoms is now determined by the detection eﬃciency of a
low-velocity triplet helium atom, which is estimated to be
in the range 10
70% (see also Refs. [5, 14], and references
therein). This measuring method therefore cannot pro-
vide better than 50% accuracy in the number of trapped
atoms.

−

2. Fluorescence detection

In addition to the determination of the MOT atom
number by time-of-ﬂight measurements, we monitor the
ﬂuorescence of the cloud using a calibrated CCD camera
to independently determine the number of atoms. Here,
the cascade via the 3 3S1 state oﬀers the 706 nm wave-
length, which is far more eﬃciently detected by a camera
than ﬂuorescence from a 1083 nm MOT. Moreover, the
706 nm light does not suﬀer from reabsorption, because
of the insigniﬁcant population of the 2 3P2 level. There-
fore we can safely assume the monitored ﬂuorescence to
be proportional to the number of atoms at each point in
the cloud image, even at the highest densities obtained in
our MOT. To calibrate the camera, we use a small frac-
tion of the Ti:Sa laser output, with the laser tuned to 706
nm. In the atom number determination we use dichroic
mirrors to block all other wavelengths scattered from the
MOT, most importantly the abundant 389 nm light. To

In the above equation, S = I/I0, where I0 is the satu-
ration intensity in the case of σ+ transitions in an opti-
cally pumped environment, and I is the laser intensity
of a single MOT beam. The phenomenological factor
C incorporates the eﬀects of reduced saturation; as the
six circularly polarized MOT laser beams traverse the
cloud in diﬀerent directions and at varying angles with
the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld, all transitions between the
ground- and excited-state Zeeman levels must be consid-
ered, and the saturation intensity I0, as deﬁned above,
no longer applies. It is pointed out in Ref. [16] that C lies
somewhere halfway the average of the squared Clebsch-
Gordan coeﬃcients of all involved transitions, and 1. For
the 2 3S1
3 3P2 389 nm transition, the average of the
squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients is 0.56. There-
fore, we adopt C = 0.8
0.2, as also chosen by Browaeys
et al. [9]. This value incorporates a realistic estimate
and an uncertainty that covers the range of all physically
possible values of C.

→

±

The ﬂuorescence image of the cloud is also used to de-
termine the volume of the cloud. From a ﬁt to a Gaussian
distribution, we obtain the rms size in the radial (σρ) and
axial (σz) directions, and the volume V = (2π)3/2σ2
ρσz
(V contains 68% of the atoms). For a cloud with Gaus-
sian density distribution, this deﬁnition of V conveniently
connects the number of atoms N to the central density
n0 via N = n0V . This provides all necessary information
to deduce the density distribution n(r).

3.

Ion detection

In the MOT vacuum chamber, positive ions are pro-
duced in Penning-ionizing collisions of a He* atom with
another He* atom or with a background gas molecule.
These ions are subsequently attracted to and detected
by the second channeltron, and the resulting output cur-
rent provides a rough measure of the number of trapped
atoms. This signal is particularly useful for optimization
purposes. Moreover, the signal is used to monitor the
trap decay after the loading of the MOT has suddenly
been stopped (see Sec. IV B). This channeltron is oper-
ated at a suﬃciently low voltage, such that the output
current can safely be assumed to vary linearly with the
detection rate.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. MOT results

1. Temporal ﬂuctuations in the MOT

While observing the ﬂuorescing cloud in real time with
the CCD camera we noticed nonperiodic intensity ﬂuc-
tuations on a 50 ms timescale. Also, the cloud was ir-
regularly ’breathing’. To determine the source of these
ﬂuctuations, we ﬁrst took a series of ten pictures of the
cloud. The shutter time for each picture was 1/60 s,
and the elapsed time between two subsequent exposures
about 5 s. Fitting the cloud size for each individual pic-
ture we obtain an average MOT volume with a standard
deviation of 9%, while the temperature remained con-
stant within 2.5%. According to Eqs. 1 and 3, this may
be related to the unstable laser power. In that case the
resulting density ﬂuctuations should inﬂuence the rate at
which ions are produced in two-body Penning collsions.
To observe this, we compared the continuous ion signal
with the laser intensity as a function of time. It turns out
that the 4% laser intensity noise correlates to the ion sig-
nal noise, though it does not explain all irregularities in
the ion signal. Using Eq. (3) we ﬁnd that the measured
intensity ﬂuctuations may give rise to 6% variations in
the deduced MOT volume.

The maximum number of loaded atoms as derived
107 at a detuning ∆ =
35 MHz and gradient ∂B/∂z = 39 G/cm. The total in-
−
tensity in this case is about 100I0. It is possible to run the
MOT at intensities as low as 40I0, although the number
of trapped atoms increases with intensity. To ensure a re-
liable estimate of the cloud dimensions and ﬂuorescence
intensity we take the average of ﬁve subsequent images.
The uncertainty in the number of trapped atoms mainly
arises from the inaccuracy of the value of the phenomeno-
logical constant C (8%), as well as from an error in the

rescence measurement is set by the 4% inaccuracy in the
calibration and by the shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations between
the individual images used in the average. To ensure con-
sistency between the results of the ﬂuorescence and TOF
measurement, we have to assign a value of 15(2)% to the
detection eﬃciency of the channeltron. A Gaussian den-

volume V of the 389 nm MOT are found to be 6 to 25
times smaller [5]. Although the auxiliary laser beam at
1083 nm acts as a seventh MOT beam, its eﬀect on the
cloud volume is negligible on account of its large detuning
(80 MHz), and the relatively small photon momentum of
the 1083 nm light. Using Eq. (1) and Eq. (3), V can be
corrected for the diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld gradients, satu-
ration parameters, and temperatures for the 389 nm and
1083 nm cases. It follows that the observed compression
of the cloud, due to only the increased laser cooling force,
is approximately a factor 5, as predicted in Sec. II A. The
optimum number of atoms is achieved with a relatively
large magnetic ﬁeld gradient, about twice as large as in
a 1083 nm MOT.

With the knowledge of N and V we can determine the

central density n0 = N/V , which is 1.4(5)
the case of optimized trapped atom number. The large
error bar, indicating the spread about the mean of the
central densities obtained from each picture, is proba-
bly due to the correlation between the volume and the
389 nm laser power ﬂuctuations. A sudden increase in
power leads to a smaller volume, while the ﬂuorescence
intensity increases, resulting in an overestimate of the
trapped atom number. The aspect ratio σz/σρ of the
cloud turns out to be 0.96(2). We compared this with
the aspect ratio as predicted by Eq. (1): since at equilib-

using Eq. (5) to calculate the 389 nm molasses temper-

ns, whereas the lifetime of the 3 3P state is 95 ns due
to the presence of the extra 3 3P

nel [7]). Second, the 10% decay via the 3 3S1 cascade
slightly reduces the diﬀusion, as the recoil of the pho-
tons involved is randomly distributed. A recalculation
of the momentum diﬀusion constant for this case yields
a 3% reduction. Thus, we expect the 389 nm molasses

The low temperatures found in our MOT may indicate
that (sub-)Doppler cooling mechanisms are more eﬃcient
using the 389 nm transition. The sub-Doppler frictional
force is indeed proportional to k2. However, the sub-
Doppler temperature limit (at low saturation parameter)
is independent of k, as the diﬀusion coeﬃcient also scales
with k2. Moreover, the capture velocity for such mecha-
nisms is proportional to the wavelength of the transition
and therefore smaller in the 389 nm case. Also, the recoil
temperature associated with the absorption and emission
of single 389 nm photons (32 µK) is close to the Doppler
limit (36 µK), and therefore sub-Doppler cooling theory
is expected to fail for the temperatures observed in our

The losses are largely due to Penning-ionizing collisions,
which yield one positively charged ion per loss event.
These ions are attracted towards the ion detector, re-
sulting in an ion ﬂux φ.

The loss rate constants are determined from the trap
decay when the loading is stopped by simultaneously
blocking all 1083 nm laser beams entering the apparatus.
This disables the Zeeman slower and collimation section,
and prevents the auxiliary Zeeman slower laser beam
of contributing to the two-body collision rate via light-
assisted collisions. Switching oﬀ the collimation mini-
mizes the Penning ionization contribution of metastables
from the atomic beam and, thus, reduces the background
signal.

Here, B is a constant background signal and ǫa and ǫb
are the eﬃciencies with which ions are produced and de-
tected for losses due to background and two-body colli-
sions, respectively. Collisions that do not lead to Penning
ionization but do result in trap loss, e.g. collisions with
groundstate helium atoms, reduce ǫa. Radiative escape
may aﬀect ǫb. For the ﬁt procedure, the ratio ǫ = ǫb/ǫa
must be known. From the increase in background pres-
sure when the helium atomic beam is running, we deduce
that the background gas consists for 80% of helium when
the MOT is on. Unfortunately, our setup is not suited
for experimental determination of ǫ, as done by Bardou
et al. [20]. They experimentally found ǫ = 4
1. Since
in our case the background gas involves mainly ground-
state helium atoms, we expect ǫa to be smaller than unity.
The value of ǫb is probably close to unity: following Tol
et al. [5], one ﬁnds that for the 1083 nm case ǫb ≈
0.98.
We take the obvious underestimate ǫ = 1, which implies
that the result of the ﬁt for βn0 has to be considered
an upper limit. The result for α can also be obtained
by ﬁtting the tail of the decaying ion signal, where the
density is low enough to neglect the contribution of the
two-body losses. In this way, the signiﬁcance of ǫ in the
determination of α is strongly (but not completely) re-
duced.

±

A typical example of a decaying ion signal is depicted
in Fig. 5. The decay clearly shows nonexponential behav-
ior, indicating that two-body collisions contribute signif-
icantly to the total losses. Since laser power ﬂuctua-
tions cause density ﬂuctuations, much noise is visible in
the ion signal. Therefore an average of ten decay tran-
sients is ﬁtted, as also shown in Fig. 5. Unfortunately,
this may aﬀect the reliability of the ﬁtted parameters as
the two-body loss rate depends nonlinearly on intensity.
However, apart from intensity noise the 389 nm output
remained constant over a period suﬃciently long to per-
form the measurements.

The ﬁt procedure yields values for the exponential time
constant α and the nonexponential time constant βn0.
We typically ﬁnd α = 2 s−1 and βn0 = 3 s−1. This
gives the rate coeﬃcient β from the ﬁt parameter βn0,

and Eq. (11) that the Condon radius for 389 nm excita-
tion is 2.8 times smaller than for 1083 nm. Classically,
the cross section for the collision is determined by the
square of the Condon radius, and is therefore expected
to decrease by almost a factor 8.

To identify the role played by light-assisted collisions in
the total two-body losses, we assume that β, as deﬁned in
Eq. (7), can be decomposed in two terms: βSS and βSP .
Here βSS is the rate coeﬃcient for losses due to collisions
between 2 3S1 atoms in the absence of light, whereas βSP
takes the light-assisted collisional losses into account and
depends (for given detuning and saturation parameter)
on the cross section and, thus, on the Condon radius as
described above. We neglect collisions between excited-
state atoms, since the excited-state population in our far-
red-detuned MOT does not exceed 0.01. We can deﬁne

varies only slowly with wavelength [21]. Neglecting this
wavelength dependence, the probability of photoioniza-
tion simply becomes the product of the upper 3 3P2 state
population and the ionization probability itself. For the

2. Two-photon ionization

From the ﬁt to the ion signal decay, we extract the
linear loss rate coeﬃcient α. Unlike the situation in
1083 nm magneto-optical traps, α is not solely deter-
mined by background-gas collisions, but also by the two-
photon ionization rate. We assume that each loss event
involves only one He* atom and ignore photoionization
of the molecular complex formed during a light-assisted
collision, as this process enters Eq. (8) via β. Hence the
loss rate coeﬃcient can be written

α = αbgr + α2ph,

(13)

where αbgr denotes the background gas collisional rate,
and α2ph accounts for the two-photon ionization loss rate.
Two processes can be thought to cause the ionization:
two-photon ionization of a 2 3S1 atom, or photoioniza-
tion of an atom in either the 3 3P2 or the 3 3S1 state.
The latter state is populated only during the cascade
and has a lifetime of only 35 ns, so its contribution will
be negligible. The instantaneous two-photon ionization
probability pinst is, for not too large detuning ∆, depen-
dent on intensity S and MOT detuning ∆ according to

The photoionization probability ppi of a helium atom in

their results we ﬁnd photoionization rates of about 2 s−1.
Since the fraction of n = 3 atoms in our MOT is typically
below the 1% level, the net loss rate due to the two-step
process then would be one order of magnitude smaller
than the measured value for α2ph. This suggests that
instantaneous two-photon ionization dominates over the
two-step ionization losses.

C. Auxiliary Zeeman slower, loading rate, and
MOT capture velocity

To test the performance of the auxiliary Zeeman
slower, we ﬁrst optimized the number of atoms in the
MOT in the absence of the extra slowing laser. Then,
leaving the MOT parameters unaltered, we unblock the
auxiliary laser beam and vary the slower laser intensi-
ties and Zeeman coil current iteratively until a new op-
timum for the number of atoms is established. Indeed,
blocking the additional laser beam again interrupts the
loading, demonstrating that we have tuned the end veloc-
ity of the Zeeman decelerator above the capture velocity
of the MOT. With the auxiliary Zeeman slower on, the
number of atoms is 40% times larger as compared to the
case without the auxiliary Zeeman slower. Making use of
Eq. (6), with α, β, and n0 known from experiment, we
calculate that the auxiliary Zeeman slower enhances the
loading rate by a factor 1.6. Despite this improvement,
the loading rate remains low. By solving Eq. (6), with
the measured values for the loss rate constants and the
steady-state number of atoms as input, we ﬁnd a loading
rate slightly below 108 s−1. Tol et al. [5] state a value
109 s−1 for their 1083 nm MOT. This diﬀerence
of 5
is explained by the smaller MOT diameter, the reduced
ﬂux of slow atoms from the Zeeman slower due to atomic
beam expansion, and imperfect collimation due to the
relatively large bandwidth of the 1083 nm laser.

×

From the Zeeman slower settings it is possible to calcu-
late the end velocity of the atoms and, thus, the capture
velocity of the MOT. Therefore, the equations of motion
of an atom subject to the decelerating laser beam are
solved. We take into account the saturation parameter,
the laser beam intensity proﬁle, and the magnetic ﬁeld
(obtained from a detailed calculation). In this way we
derive a capture velocity of 35 m/s (without using the
auxiliary Zeeman slower). Apparently, the prediction of
a 24 m/s capture velocity by the model of Sec. II B is an
underestimate, and the true capture velocity lies closely
to the velocity determined by the resonance condition.
Therefore, it is likely that π and σ transitions, caused by
MOT laser beams orthogonal to the quantization axis,
occur at rates at least comparable to the 10% decay via
the 3 3S1 cascade. Apparently, the nonclosed character
of the 389 nm transition plays a minor role, even in the
case of relatively large (

40 G) magnetic ﬁelds.

We derive from the settings of the Zeeman slower that
atoms with a velocity of at most 75 m/s are further de-
celerated to a velocity of 35 m/s by the auxiliary Zeeman

∼

10

slower. This translates to an increase in loading rate by
a factor 1.7, in reasonable agreement with the result of
the test described above.

D. Comparison with 1083 nm MOT

Table I contains MOT results for the 389 nm and 1083
nm case [5]. Both MOTs have similar detuning and
saturation parameter, which optimize both density and
trapped atom number. The smaller number of atoms N
in the 389 nm MOT is explained by the small loading
rate. Despite this small number, the central density n0
is equal to that of a 1083 nm MOT containing over one
order of magnitude more atoms. This is the result of
the smaller loss rate constant β, the larger laser cooling
force, and the larger magnetic ﬁeld gradient. The lat-
ter not only contributes to the compression of the cloud,
but also reﬂects the necessity of a large Zeeman detun-
ing to compensate the larger Doppler shift of the atoms
to be captured from the Zeeman-decelerated He* beam.
Furthermore, we observe that the 0.5 s−1 contribution of
two-photon ionization to the losses in the 389 nm MOT
is small compared to the 21 s−1 two-body loss rate in a
large 1083 nm MOT.

V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have shown that it is possible to build a magneto-
optical trap using the 389 nm transition in triplet he-
lium. Our prototype MOT demonstrates that a 389
nm MOT oﬀers the advantage of a dense, cold cloud
of metastable helium atoms, as compared to a 1083 nm
MOT. The relatively large density is allowed by the re-
duced two-body loss rate coeﬃcient β, whereas the large
spontaneous force moderates substantial compression of
the cloud. Intensity noise on the 389 nm output, how-
ever, compromises the measurement accuracy. Together
with the high background pressure and the small value
of β, this has complicated an accurate determination of
its value. We conclude that β lies between the experi-
10−9 cm3/s, and
mentally determined upper limit 1.0
the two-body loss rate constant in the absence of light,
10−10 cm3/s determined in Ref. [5]. Two-photon ion-
2
ization losses, although present, do not exclude the future
possibility of a 389 nm MOT containing large numbers of
metastable helium atoms at high phase-space density. To
this end, however, the loading rate of the MOT must be
improved. A bare 389 nm MOT has limited loading ca-
pabilities since the large Doppler shift implies a reduced
capture velocity, and the required Zeeman slower settings
then give rise to a smaller ﬂux of slow metastables. The
nonclosed character of the 389 nm transition, however,
does not play an important role in the capture process,
as well as in the other physics involved in the MOT.

For the near future we plan an ultimate experiment,
in a conﬁguration with a loading rate increased by two

with a
two-body losses in the trapped cloud due to the presence
of red-detuned 1083 nm light, a
5 mm diameter hole
has to be created in the center of the 1083 nm MOT
laser beams. This conﬁguration will beneﬁt from the su-
perior loading capability of the 1083 nm MOT, as well
as from the low-loss 389 nm environment containing a
dense cloud at relatively low temperature. Furthermore,
we will test the eﬀectiveness of 389 nm molasses on a
metastable helium cloud, precooled by a 1083 nm MOT.
This seems promising not only because of the low tem-
peratures observed already in our 389 nm MOT, but also
because of the relatively high saturation intensity. This
can be seen as follows. In a 1083 nm molasses, starting
with a large, dense cloud of helium metastables, the rel-
ative absorption is rather large [10]. Within the cloud,

this results in intensity imbalances between two counter-
propagating molasses laser beams, and these imbalances
are believed to reduce the eﬀectiveness of the molasses.
The larger saturation intensity of the 389 nm transition
implies lower relative absorption and, thus, a reduced in-
tensity imbalance. Therefore, we expect to obtain lower
temperatures in a 389 nm molasses.

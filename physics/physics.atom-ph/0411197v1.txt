An optical atomic clock scheme is developed that utilizes two lasers to establish coherent coupling
between the 5s2 1S0 ground state of 88Sr and the ﬁrst excited state, 5s5p 3P0. The coupling is
mediated by the broad 5s5p 1P1 state, exploiting the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced
transparency. The eﬀective linewidth of the clock transition can be chosen at will by adjusting the
laser intensity. By trapping the 88Sr atoms in an optical lattice, long interaction times with the
two lasers are ensured; Doppler and recoil eﬀects are eliminated. Based on a careful analysis of
systematic errors, a clock accuracy of better than 2 × 10

−17 is expected.

Armed with superior resonance quality factors, optical
atomic clocks based on single trapped ions or a collection
of laser cooled neutral atoms are expected to outperform
microwave-based atomic clocks in the near future [1, 2, 3].
While a large number of quantum absorbers in a neutral
atom system provide an advantage in the enhanced short-
term frequency stability, atomic motion during the probe
phase seriously limits the attainable accuracy. A compet-
itive proposal is to localize neutral cold atoms spatially
in a Lamb-Dicke regime while the trapping potential is
designed such that its presence does not inﬂuence the
clock transition frequency [4]. This scheme can be poten-
tially realized using a far-oﬀ-resonance dipole trap oper-
ating at a wavelength where the ground and the excited
state of the clock transition experience exactly the same
AC Stark shifts. In particular, if the atoms are conﬁned
near the ground vibrational levels in an optical lattice,
frequency shifts associated with eﬀects such as Doppler,
collision, and recoil will all be reduced to negligible levels.

To realize such a scheme,

it is of essential impor-
tance that the polarizabilities of the two clock states are
matched to a high degree of accuracy at the “magic”
wavelength [5]. States with scalar polarizabilities are pre-
ferred, to avoid the problem of the complex and some-
times uncontrolled light polarization inside an optical
lattice. The fermionic strontium isotope, 87Sr, oﬀers a
nearly satisfactory solution [5, 6]. The nuclear magnetic
dipole moment of 87Sr makes the 5s2 1S0 – 5s5p 3P0 tran-
sition weakly dipole allowed, with a predicted linewidth
of about 1 mHz [5, 7, 8]. The two clock states have very
small electronic angular momenta (due to hyperﬁne mix-
ing) and their polarizabilities are nearly scalar. However,
the hyperﬁne structure can cause a clock frequency shift
(possibly as large as 10 Hz) by ﬂuctuations of the lattice
light polarization. The large nuclear spin (I = 9/2) also
brings complexity in state preparation and ﬁeld control.

In this Letter, we propose a scheme for an optical clock

that is based on states of true scalar nature, namely
5s2 1S0 – 5s5p 3P0 of 88Sr (with I = 0). A direct tran-
sition between these two states is of course completely
forbidden, and the clock scheme is based instead on three-
level quantum coherence established by two probe laser
frequencies. We note that recently a scheme has emerged
based on four levels and three probe lasers [9]. An esti-
mate of the expected accuracy for this scheme is not yet
available. A scheme similar to what is discussed here was
investigated for trapped ions [10].

FIG. 1: Three-level coherence in neutral 88Sr. 5s2 1S0 and
5s5p 3P0 are the two clock levels. By applying the probe and
the dressing laser as shown, a coherent coupling is established
between the clock levels, mediated by the 5s5p 1P1 level.

Our proposal rests on the three-level

lambda-type
scheme shown in Fig. 1. Particularly promising in this
context is strontium [4, 5, 6, 11], which we consider here
in detail. A similar scheme is conceivable for bosonic
isotopes of other alkaline-earth species (including ytter-
bium). Since the ground state (5s2 1S0)—subsequently
denoted by the state vector |1i—and the ﬁrst excited
state (5s5p 3P0)—|2i—of 88Sr are characterized by a to-
tal angular momentum of J = 0, electric and magnetic
one-photon transition matrix elements between these two
|2i decays radia-
states vanish to any multipole order.

tively via E1M1 two-photon emission after a lifetime of
a few thousand years [7]. For practical purposes, it is
therefore legitimate to set the decay width of |2i equal
to zero. The 5s5p 1P1 state, which is referred to as |3i in
our scheme, can be reached from |1i via E1 one-photon
absorption using a probe laser at a wavelength of 461 nm
(frequency ωp). One M1 photon from a dressing laser at
1354 nm (frequency ωd) is needed to resonantly couple
|2i and |3i. The latter decays primarily to |1i. The decay
width is γ = 2π × 32 MHz.

Assuming linear polarization of both the probe and the
dressing lasers, and assuming that the electric component
of the probe laser (amplitude E0) and the magnetic com-
ponent of the dressing laser (amplitude B0) are aligned
along the same axis, level 3 is characterized by m = 0
for our purposes. Let Ωp = h3| D0 |1i E0/~ denote the
Rabi frequency associated with electric-dipole coupling
between levels 1 and 3. Similarly, Ωd = h3| M0 |2i B0/~ is
the Rabi frequency referring to the dressing process. Ωp
and Ωd may be taken to be real.

We ﬁrst analyze the dressed-atom problem within the
subspace spanned by |2i and |3i in the absence of the
probe laser. The equations of motion in the interaction
picture read

where c2(t) and c3(t) represent probability amplitudes
and the rotating-wave approximation has been applied.
The dressing laser detuning is δd = ωd − (ω3 − ω2) [ωi
stands for the unperturbed frequency of |ii, i = 1, 2, 3].

Due to the action of Ωd, some |3i character is admixed
to |2i (and vice versa), so that a long-lived dressed state,
˜2
, emerges whose decay rate can be adjusted through
the dressing laser intensity. It is easily seen that to lead-

deriving primarily from |3i decays with a rate that is
virtually identical to γ.

Using the atomic structure code described in Ref. [7],
which accurately treats electron correlation and spin-
orbit eﬀects in the valence shell, we obtain for the mag-
netic coupling matrix element |h3| M0 |2i| = 0.022 µB.
Hence, if an eﬀective width ˜γ of, say, 1 mHz is desired
(similar to the 87Sr case), a dressing laser intensity of
3.9 mW/cm2 must be chosen and is used for numerical
results presented in this paper. (By decreasing the inten-
sity, the eﬀective linewidth can be made even narrower.)
Under these circumstances, the parameter b in Eqs. (3)
and (4), which describes the degree of admixture of |3i
character in the long-lived dressed state, has a magnitude
of less than 10−5. In other words, the dressed states in
this scheme are hardly distinguishable from bare atomic
states. We will exploit this fact later when estimating
level shifts caused by sources not included in the simple
three-level picture of Fig. 1.

Since there is no direct coupling between |1i and |2i,
it is apparent from Eq. (3) that the transition associated
with the long-lived dressed state can only be probed from
the ground state by tuning ωp in the vicinity of ω3 + δd −
ω1, i.e. in the vicinity of the broad absorption proﬁle of
level 3. Hence, δp = ωp − (ω3 − ω1) ∼ δd. The long-
lived and the short-lived states are excited in a coherent
fashion by the probe laser. They interfere and give rise
to a narrow dip structure in the absorption proﬁle—an
eﬀect known as electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) [12]. This dip is more than 1010 times narrower
(˜γ = 2π × 1 mHz) than the bare absorption proﬁle of
level 3. The broad background is therefore essentially
constant across the narrow structure.

This quantum interference may be treated, to a ﬁrst
approximation, within a wave function-based approach,
but it fails to take into consideration the repopulation
of |1i via spontaneous emission from |3i. More impor-
tantly, the loss of coherence between levels 1 and 2 cannot
be described. Decoherence is caused by lattice-induced
spontaneous emission, atomic tunneling between adja-
cent sites in the optical lattice and ensuing collisions be-
tween the atoms. Another factor is the loss of phase co-
herence between the probe and the dressing laser. Both
aspects must be included in a realistic description. Utiliz-
ing standard density-matrix theory [13], the absorption
rate from the ground state is found to be

Wabs =

[2∆(∆ + δd)/γ − {γc + ˜γ/2}]2 + [∆ + 2γc(∆ + δd)/γ]2 ,

where ∆ = (ωp − ωd) − (ω2 − ω1), and γc stands for the

loss rate of coherence between |1i and |2i.

If the dressing laser is oﬀ, or if γc ≫ ˜γ, the simple
Lorentzian proﬁle connected with the transition from |1i
to |3i is recovered. Otherwise, if we disregard γc for a
moment, the absorption rate vanishes at ∆ = 0. Note
that the occurrence of a zero in this absorption proﬁle is
clear from the connection of this problem to the Fano [14]
lineshape for one bound state (level 2 upshifted by the
energy of one dressing laser photon) embedded in one
“continuum” (the 32 MHz wide |3i state). A deep, nar-
row dip occurs in the absorption proﬁle [15], and the

This demonstrates that not only the position of the EIT
dip, but also its width is very insensitive with respect to
ﬂuctuations of δd. A variation of the dressing laser fre-
quency by as much as 100 kHz induces a relative change
of the EIT width of less than 10−7. The eﬀect is illus-
trated in Fig. 2(a) (γc = 0). Hence, by measuring Wabs
as a function of ωp − ωd, the clock frequency ω2 − ω1 can
be determined with high accuracy by tracking the posi-
tion of the dip. Neither ωp nor ωd must be particularly
stable, only the diﬀerence needs to be stabilized.

Also shown in Fig. 2(a) is the absorption proﬁle near
∆ = 0 for relatively large detuning (δd = 5 × γ). Over-
all, the signal amplitude is drastically reduced in this
case. There is a narrow absorption peak in the immedi-
ate vicinity of ∆ = 0, but, as can be seen in Fig. 2(b), this
peak all but disappears as soon as decoherence becomes
appreciable. (We have chosen γc = ˜γ in Fig. 2(b).) On
the other hand, for small detuning the EIT dip is still
clearly visible, even though it is not as deep as in the
absence of decoherence and it has become broader. The
position of the EIT minimum and the insensitivity of the
EIT width with respect to laser frequency (δd or δp) ﬂuc-
tuations of 100 kHz or so are essentially unaﬀected.

The discussion has so far covered only resonant cou-
plings within the span of |1i, |2i, and |3i. In order to
evaluate the potential accuracy of the proposed clock
scheme, we need to consider the AC Stark shifts due to
nonresonant electric dipole coupling of |1i, |2i, and |3i to
states inside and outside the three-level subspace. Our
calculation of these shifts employs accurate experimental
and theoretical data on excitation energies and oscillator
strengths of atomic Sr [4, 16, 17]. For a probe laser inten-
sity of 10 µW/cm2, levels 1 and 2 are AC Stark-shifted
by less than 1 mHz. The dressing laser, operating at an
intensity of 3.9 mW/cm2, causes an AC Stark shift of lev-
els 1 and 2 of -41 mHz and -20 mHz, respectively. Thus,
the clock frequency is systematically shifted by about
+19 mHz. Since the intensity of the dressing laser can
be stabilized to better than 1 %, we conclude that the
AC Stark eﬀect due to the probe and dressing lasers can
be experimentally characterized at the sub-mHz level.

FIG. 2: Absorption rate from the ground state of 88Sr in
the presence of the two laser frequencies indicated in Fig. 1.
The laser-induced width, ˜γ, is 2π × 1 mHz. a) Loss of phase
coherence between levels 1 and 2 is neglected, γc = 0. Note
that the curves for δd = 0 and δd = 0.01 × γ = 2π × 320 kHz
are virtually indistinguishable. b) Macroscopic decoherence
and laser-induced decay are comparable, γc = ˜γ.

To allow for a suﬃciently long interrogation time and
eliminate systematic frequency shifts associated with
atomic motion, the atoms will be conﬁned in a Lamb-
Dicke regime in an optical lattice at the magic wave-
length for the clock transition, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
The lattice trapping ﬁeld causes, to leading order, no net
frequency shift of the clock transition as the level shifts of
1 and 2 (150 kHz well depth in Fig. 3(a), under a lattice
laser intensity of 10 kW/cm2) are exactly matched. (The
studies in Ref. [5] suggest that higher-order AC Stark ef-
fects are negligible at this lattice laser intensity.) Level
3 in our scheme, however, is shifted relative to levels 1
and 2, and this shift depends on the local intensity an
atom experiences in the lattice. We calculate a relative
shift of -250 kHz (maximum in magnitude), at a lattice
laser intensity of 10 kW/cm2 and a magic wavelength of
813.5 nm [6]. Figure 3(a) shows the lattice-induced shift
of level 3 in comparison to γ. This shift is similar—in
eﬀect and in magnitude—to the drift of the probe and
dressing laser frequencies. It has, therefore, an equally
negligible eﬀect on the properties of the EIT dip.

To make the ﬁnal estimate of the clock accuracy, the
level shifts shown in Fig. 3(a) contain the AC Stark shifts
due to the simultaneous presence of ωp and ωd laser ﬁelds
as discussed above. The lattice ﬁeld induces a sponta-
neous emission limited linewidth of the clock transition
at ∼15 mHz. The detuning and decoherence-(laser fre-
quency variations, atomic motion inside lattice, sponta-
neous emission, etc)-related changes in the EIT linewidth
may lead to a small shift in the experimental search of
the linecenter, but the shift magnitude is estimated to
be under 10−18. The blackbody radiation induced clock
frequency shift is estimated to be -0.54 Hz at 300 K,

FIG. 3: (a) Lattice-conﬁned atoms for use in the EIT clock
scheme. The AC Stark shift due to the dressing laser on the
clock transition is shown, as are the level shifts associated
with the lattice trapping ﬁeld. The expanded view of the
1P1 state compares the lattice-induced level shift versus the
linewidth γ. Atoms are cooled to the Lamb-Dicke regime, pre-
dominantly occupying the ground vibrational level in lattice.
(b) Experimental implementation of the EIT-based optical
clock. A pre-stabilized narrow-linewidth local oscillator at
698 nm establishes a tight frequency track between the probe
and dressing lasers. This enables a probe of the narrow EIT
resonance, which in turn provides a long-term clock reference
for the 698 nm local oscillator.

with a temperature coeﬃcient of -7.5 mHz/K. Finally,
the strict scalar nature of the clock transition reduces
the light polarization and stray magnetic ﬁeld-induced
frequency shift below 10−18.
In view of the available
control accuracy of the laboratory temperature and the
dressing laser intensity, the overall accuracy limit is esti-
mated to be smaller than 8 mHz, or 2 × 10−17.

Experimental implementation of this EIT-based clock
scheme is shown in Fig. 3(b). A narrow linewidth (< 1
Hz) laser at 698 nm (ωlocal) will be developed by presta-
bilizing ωlocal to a stable, passive optical cavity. The
diﬀerence frequency, ωp − ωd, between the probe laser
and the dressing laser, generated by a nonlinear optical
crystal, will be phase locked to the 698 nm local oscilla-
tor. One of the two lasers, such as ωd, as shown in Fig.
3(b), can be used as the slave to accomplish the optical
phase lock loop. Thus, ωp − ωd = ωlocal. This is presta-

4

bilization, implemented before ωp and ωd interact with
the atoms. ωp and ωd may ﬂuctuate on the order of 100
kHz, but their diﬀerence ﬂuctuates less than 1 Hz.

The frequency of ωlocal can be precisely scanned with
reference to a stable cavity mode, which of course has an
inevitable slow frequency drift due to the material nature
of the reference. However, precise scanning of ωp − ωd
through the EIT resonance enables one to activate a slow
feedback loop to stabilize ωp − ωd to the value of ω2 − ω1,
i.e., the quantum resonance corrects the long-term drift
of the cavity resonance according to the clock transition
frequency. The feedback is applied directly on the 698
nm local oscillator (ωlocal) to ensure ∆ = 0.

The tunability of the linewidth, the exquisite insen-
sitivity with respect to light polarization in the optical
lattice, the straightforward state control, and the small,
controllable AC Stark shifts promise that our EIT-based
clock scheme using bosonic 88Sr will represent a practi-
cal and robust approach for optical atomic clocks with a
competitive performance in both stability and accuracy.

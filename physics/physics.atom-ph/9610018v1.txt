Consistent analytical approach for the
quasiclassical radial dipole matrix

Short title: Quasiclassical dipole matrix elements

Abstract. A consistent analytical approach for calculation of the
quasiclassical radial dipole matrix elements in the momentum and
coordinate representations is presented. Very simple but relatively
precise expressions for the matrix elements are derived in both rep-
resentations. All analytical expressions contain only one special
function – the Anger function and its derivative. They generalise
and increase the accuracy of some known quasiclassical expressions.
The small diﬀerence between the two forms of the expressions for
the dipole matrix elements indicates to the applicability of the sim-
ple expressions given by the consistent quasiclassical approach even
for low atomic states.

1. Introduction

Calculation of transition probabilities, oscillator strengths and dipole matrix
elements for the atomic transitions is stimulated of investigations in spec-
troscopy, plasma physics, chaotic dynamics of the nonlinear systems and
other fundamental and applied ﬁelds. The accurate calculations of these
atomic characteristics are very time consuming and in some cases involve
certain diﬃculties, especially for transitions between high states. Therefore,
recently new attention has been paid to quasiclassical calculations of the
n′l′ transi-
dipole matrix elements and oscillator strengths for atomic nl
tions (Heim et al 1989, Delone et al 1989, 1994, Kaulakys 1991, D’yachkov
and Pankratov 1991, 1994, Pankratov and Meyer-ter Vehn 1992 and Nana
et al 1995). In the review paper by Delone et al (1994) the set of analyti-
cal formulae for the dipole matrix elements between quasiclassical states is
presented. However, this review paper does not reﬂect the results of the
last ﬁve-year period by Heim et al (1989), Kaulakys (1991), D’yachkov and
Pankratov (1991, 1994) Pankratov and Meyer-ter Vehn (1992) and others
and contains some inconsistencies. As a result the main formulae of the
paper contain terms with erroneous sign and do not agree with the exact
results, e.g. when s = ν′
0 with ν
and ν′ being the eﬀective principal quantum number of the initial and ﬁnal
state, respectively.

Here we present a consistent analytical approach for the quasiclassical
dipole coupling of the electron with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, taking into
account peculiarity of the radial quasiclassical matrix elements: radial wave
functions of the initial and ﬁnal states for transition with ∆l
= 0 correspond
to the diﬀerent eﬀective Hamiltonians and, therefore, we can not use the
usual correspondence between the quasiclassical matrix elements and the
Fourier components of the appropriate classical variable (see e.g. Landau
and Lifshitz 1985). So we should start from the deﬁnition of the quantum
matrix elements using the quasiclassical radial wave functions.

·

The direct way of coupling a radiation ﬁeld to the electron Hamiltonian is
through the A
p interaction (see, e.g. Bethe and Salpeter 1957 and Landau
and Lifshitz 1985) where A is the vector potential of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and p =
is the momentum operator. When the radiation wave-
length is long compared with atomic dimension, as is the case for optical or
microwave transitions, the variation of the vector potential within the atom

i¯h

∇

−

can be neglected. In this case the electric ﬁeld is also uniform over the extent
of the atom. So that the electric dipole moment is the only atomic multipole
coupled to the ﬁeld in the multipolar approximation to the interaction oper-
ator and the interaction of the electron with the ﬁeld may also be expressed
through the E
r term, where E is the electric ﬁeld strength and r is the
electron’s coordinate. As a matter of fact, the two forms of the interaction
Hamiltonian in the dipole approximation are equivalent due to the gauge
invariance of the ﬁeld.

·

Usually one calculates the radial dipole matrix elements in the coordinate
form (see Heim et al 1989, Delone et al 1989, 1994, Kaulakys 1991, D’yachkov
and Pankratov 1991, 1994, Pankratov and Meyer-ter Vehn 1992, Nana et al
and
1995 and references therein). For the precise wave functions of the

Ea)/¯h are the electron mass and the angular
holds. Here m and ωb,a = (Eb −
frequency of the corresponding transition, respectively. However, when one
uses approximate wave functions in the evaluation of the matrix elements,
the length and velocity forms in general yield diﬀerent results and the re-
lationship (1) holds only roughly or even fails (see, e.g. Crossley 1969). If
asymptotically correct wave functions are used, the r-form of the dipole ma-
trix elements is preferable as it stresses the contributions to the integral from
the large r region. On the other hand, for the wave functions correct at small
and medium r the velocity form should be used as it puts more weight on
the integral at small and medium r. The quasiclassical wave functions in the
classically allowed region of motion are not correct asymptotically as well as
for very small r but are relatively accurate for the medium r between the two
turning points of the classical orbit. Therefore, it is likely that the velocity
form of the quasiclassical matrix elements is as much (or, maybe, even more)
accurate as the length form.

2. Radial dipole matrix elements for any spherical potential

Calculation of the angular part of the matrix elements is a simple problem
and, therefore, we restrict ourselves to the radial part. The radial dipole

Further calculations of the matrix elements (2) are similar to those by
Heim et al (1989) and Kaulakys (1991). Substituting equation (3) into equa-
tion (2) and neglecting the rapidly oscillating sine and cosine of the sum of
the phases Φnl and Φn′l′ one ﬁnally ﬁnds that

It follows from equations (6)–(8) that only for ∆l = 0 the quasiclassical
matrix elements of the module of the radius vector r coincide with the Fourier
components of the classical variable r(t) and may be expressed through the

It is of interest to note the connection between the expressions for the
dipole matrix elements (6) – (10) and the energy change of the classical
atom in a monochromatic ﬁeld (see Gontis and Kaulakys 1987 and Kaulakys
1991). The mapping equations of motion for the classical hydrogen atom
in an oscillating electric ﬁeld derived on the bases of the velocity form of
interaction are suitable for investigation of transition to chaotic behaviour
and ionisation of Rydberg atoms even in the low frequency ﬁeld when the
strength of the external ﬁeld is comparable with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the
atom (Kaulakys and Vilutis 1995).

Until now we did not use the explicit form of the potential U(r). There-
fore, equations (1)–(12) are valid for any spherical potential. Further we will
apply this theory for the non-hydrogenic atoms.

3. The non-hydrogenic atom

The potential U(r) which deﬁnes the motion of the Rydberg electron of the
non-hydrogenic atom or ion may be expressed as a sum of two terms —
Z/r of the ion core with charge Z = Zion + 1 and
the Coulomb potential
the perturbation potential ∆U(r) due to the deviation from the Coulomb
approximation, i.e.

For the non-hydrogenic atom the perturbation potential ∆U(r) is short-range
and results to the non-Coulomb scattering phase δl related with the quantum
defect µl by the relationship δl = πµl.The energy Enl of the
-state is
related to the eﬀective principal quantum number ν and the quantum defect

Signiﬁcant contribution to the integrals (6) and (8) arise from the regions
with relatively large r where the potential U (r) is well represented by the
Coulomb potential V (r) =
Z/r. The additional potential ∆U(r) results
mainly to the non-Coulomb scattering phaseshift δl (see Kaulakys 1991).
Thus, the phase (5) and the phase diﬀerence (7) in the region of the main
contribution to the dipole matrix element may be represented as

More precisely, the non-Coulomb phase shifts δl and δl′ and, consequently

To the best of our knowledge equations (20) and (21) are derived for
the ﬁrst time while equations (22) and (23) within the accuracy of fac-

coincide with the equation (16) in the paper by Kaulakys

(1991) and are close to the corresponding expressions given by D’yachkov

Nana et al 1995). Note, that for the ﬁrst time the dipole matrix elements in
the coordinate representation have been expressed through the Anger func-
tion and its derivative (however, with some erroneous signs) by Davydkin
and Zon (1981).

In the derivation of equations (22) and (23) one integrates equation (8)

Thus, the diﬀerence between the quasiclassical dipole matrix elements in the
r-and p-forms, the second term in equation (23), results from the replacement
of the electron’s motion in the eﬀective potential U(r) by the motion in the
Coulomb potential with the additional phase δl. Therefore, the quasiclassical
radial dipole matrix element in the coordinate representation (22)–(23) may
contain some additional inaccuracy. On the other hand, the diﬀerence (25)
between two forms of the dipole matrix elements may be as a criterion of the
exactness of the quasiclassical approximation. As a rule, the additional term
e) for states with low l and
(25) is small because of the small factor (1
of the small factor sin πs for states with larger l but small quantum defects
∆n close to the integer. In expansion of

this additional term makes up less than half of the third, proportional to

for the dipole matrix elements even for the low atomic states. The extensive
analysis of such approach and comparison with the numerical Hartree-Fock
calculations will be presented elsewhere. Here we will present only the lim-

in comparison with transitions, when n and l change in the same direction.

Thus, the very simple expressions (20)–(23) cover all known quasiclassi-
cal non-relativistic results for the dipole matrix elements. They generalize
and increase the accuracy of some earlier derived expressions. Extension of
the present approach to the continuum states is rather straightforward (see
Kaulakys 1991 for analysis in the r-representation).

5. Conclusions

Consistent analytical approach for calculation of the quasiclassical radial
dipole matrix elements in the momentum and coordinate representations is
presented and very simple but relatively precise expressions for the matrix
elements are derived in both representations. All analytical expressions for
the quasiclassical radial matrix elements in both representations contain only
one special function – the Anger function and its derivative. They general-
ize and increase the accuracy of some known quasiclassical expressions. The
small diﬀerence between the two forms of the expressions for the dipole ma-
trix elements indicates to the applicability of the simple expressions given by
the consistent quasiclassical approach even for low atomic states.

It is important to note that the dipole matrix elements as the analytical
functions (even for the hydrogenic atom) are expressed through the Anger but
not through the Bessel functions. It is another thing that the Anger functions
Jν (z) of the integer order ν = m coincide with the Bessel functions Jm(z), i.e.
1)mJ−m (z) = Jm(z). Expression of the dipole matrix elements
Jm (z) = (
through the Bessel function Js(es) or through the Anger function of the
positive order and positive argument Js (es) (see, e.g. Delone et al 1994)
results to the erroneous limit when s

0 and to another inaccuracies.

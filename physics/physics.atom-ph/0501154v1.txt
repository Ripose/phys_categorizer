Searches for permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) of fundamental particles
render the possibility to discover New Physics beyond present Standard Theory.
New ideas for experiments have come up recently which may allow to lower present
limits substantially or even ﬁnd unambiguous eﬀects. Such are predicted by a
variety of speculative models. The identiﬁcation of potential sources for CP and
T-violation will require to study several systems, which all have diﬀerent sensitivity
to possible mechanisms generating EDMs.

1. Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) provides a remarkable framework to describe
observations in particle physics. Despite the success of the SMa, a number
of most intriguing questions remains in modern physics. Among those are
the observation of exactly three generations of fundamental particles and
the hierarchy of the fundamental fermion masses. In addition, the electro-
weak SM has a rather large number of some 27 free parameters, which all
need to be extracted from experiments1.

In modern physics - and in particular in the SM - symmetries play an im-
portant and central role. Whereas global symmetries relate to conservation
laws, local symmetries yield forces.2 It is rather unsatisfactory that within
the SM the physical origin of the observed breaking of discrete symmetries
in weak interactions, e.g. of parity (P), of time reversal (T) and of com-

bined charge conjugation and parity (CP), remains unrevealed, although
the experimental ﬁndings can be well described.

The speculative models beyond the present standard theory include such
which involve Left-Right symmetry, fundamental fermion compositeness,
new particles, leptoquarks, supersymmetry, supergravity and many more.
Interesting candidates for an all encompassing quantum ﬁeld theory are
string or membrane (M) theories which in their low energy limit may in-
clude supersymmetry. Without secure experimental evidence to be gained
in future all of these speculative theories will remain without status in
physics, independent of their mathematical elegance and partial appeal.
Experimental searches for predicted unique features of those models - such
as breaking of symmetries - are therefore essential to steer theory towards
a better and deeper understanding of fundamental laws in nature. Such
experiments can be carried out in a complementary manner at high energy
accelerators and also at lower energies - typically in the regime of atomic
physics - in high precision measurements, such as EDMs searches.

2. Discrete Symmetries

In this article we are concerned with discrete symmetries. A permanent
electric dipole moment (EDM) of any fundamental particle or quantum
system violates both parity (P) and time reversal (T) symmetries.3

The violation of P is well established in physics4 and its accurate de-
scription has contributed signiﬁcantly to the credibility of the SM. The
observation of neutral currents together with the observation of parity non-
conservation in atoms were important to verify the validity of the SM. The
fact that physics over 10 orders in momentum transfer - from atoms to
highest energy scattering - yields the same electro-weak parameters may be
viewed as one of the biggest successes in physics to date. However, at the
level of highest precision electro-weak experiments questions arose, which
ultimately may call for a reﬁnement.

The predicted running of the weak mixing angle sin2ΘW appears not to
be in agreement with observations 5. If the value of sin2ΘW is ﬁxed at the
Z0-pole, deep inelastic electron scattering at several GeV appears to yield
a considerably higher value. A reported disagreement from atomic parity
violation in Cs has disappeared after a revision of atomic theory 6. A new
round of experiments is being started with the Qweak experiment 7 at the
Jeﬀerson Laboratory in the USA. For atomic parity violation in principle
higher experimental accuracy will be possible from experiments using Fr

neutrons and muons the region where speculative models have predicted a ﬁnite value for an EDM can be reached with presently proposed experiments
in the near future.

Note: Interesting systems such as deuterons and Ra atoms are not listed, because no experiments have been performed yet. However, higher sensitivity
to non-SM EDMs has been predicted compared to neutrons (e.g. more than one order of magnitude for certain quark chromo EDMs 17 and Hg atoms
(e.g. more than three orders of magnitude for an electron EDM18 and two orders for nuclear EDMs19) respectively.

isotopes20,21 or single Ba or Ra ions in radiofrequency traps 22. Although
the weak eﬀects are larger in these systems due to their high power de-
pendence on the nuclear charge, this can only be exploited after improved
atomic wave function calculations will be available, as the observation is
always through an interference of weak with electromagnetic eﬀects.23

The violation of the combined charge conjugation (C) and parity (P)
operations has been observed ﬁrst in the neutral Kaon decays and can be
described with a phase in the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa formalism24.
CP-Violation is particularly highly interesting through its possible rela-
tion to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. A.
Sakharov25 has suggested that the observed dominance of matter could be
explained via CP-violation in the early universe in a state of thermal non-
equilibrium and with baryon number violating processes.b CP violation as
described in the SM is insuﬃcient to satisfy the needs of this elegant model.
This strongly motivates searches for yet unknown sources of CP-Violation.

3. Searches for Permanent Electric Dipole Moments

Excellent opportunities to ﬁnd such new CP-Violation are provided through
possible EDMs. With the assumption of CPT invariance CP- and T-
violation can be considered equivalent3 and therefore an EDM also violates
CP. For all particles CP-Violation as it is known from the K and B mesons
causes EDMs to appear through higher order loops 3. These are at least
4 orders of magnitude below the present experimental limits (see Table 1).
Several speculative models foresee EDMs which could be as large as the
present experimental bounds just allow.c

EDMs have been searched for in various systems with diﬀerent sensi-
tivities (Table 1). The spectrum of activities has been frequently reviewed
in the recent past.3,28,29,30 A number of distinctively diﬀerent precision
experiments to search for am EDM in one or another system are under
way and several ideas for signiﬁcant improvements have been made public.
Still, the electron and the neutron get the largest attention of experimental
groups. In composed systems such as molecules or atoms fundamental parti-
cle dipole moments of constituents may be signiﬁcantly enhanced28. For the

bWe note here that the existence of additional sources of CP-Violation is not a necessary
condition to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. Other viable routes could lead
through CPT violation and there without the need of thermal non-equilibrium.26
cHistorically the non-observation of any EDM has ruled out more speculative models
than any other experimental approach in all of particle physics 27.

The physical systems investigated fall in ﬁve groups, i.e.

electron signiﬁcant enhancement factors are planned to be exploited such as
those associated with the large internal electric ﬁelds in polar molecules.31
(i) ’point’
particles (e, µ, τ ), (ii) nucleons (n, p), (iii) nuclei (2H, 223Fr, ...), (iv) atoms
(Hg, Xe, Tl, Cs, Rn, Ra,...) and (v) molecules (TlF, YbF, PbO, ...), where
each investigated object has its own particular advantages. Among the
methods employed are (i) Classical approaches using optical spectroscopy
of atoms and molecules in cells, as well as atomic and molecular beams or
with contained cold neutrons, (ii) Modern atomic physics techniques such
as traps, fountains and interference techniques; (iii) Innovative approaches
involving radioactive species, storage rings, particles in condensed matter,
’masers’, and more. It will remain to be seen, which of all these promising
approaches will succeed in providing new limits or even ﬁnd an EDM.d

We must note that there is no preferred system to search for an EDM.
In fact, many systems need to be examined, because depending on the
underlying processes diﬀerent systems have in general quite signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent susceptibility to acquire an EDM through a particular mechanism
(see Figure 1). An EDM may be found an ”intrinsic property” of an ele-
mentary particle as we know them, because the underlying mechanism is
not accessible at present. However, it can also arise from CP-odd forces
between the constituents under observation, e.g. between nucleons in nu-
clei or between nuclei and electrons. Such EDMs could be much higher 17
than such expected for elementary particles originating within the popular,
usually New Physics models.

4. Some New Developments in the Field of EDM Searches

This highly active ﬁeld of research beneﬁted recently from a plurality of
novel ideas. Those have led to new activities in systems not investigated so
far. Among those are in particular radioactive atoms and charged particles.

4.1. Radioactive Systems

New facilities around the world make more short-lived radioactive isotopes
available for experiments. Of particular interest is the Ra atom, which

Figure 1. A variety of theoretical speculative models exists in which an EDM could be induced through diﬀerent mechanisms or a
combination of them into fundamental particles and composed systems for which an EDM would be experimentally accessible. Up to
now very sensitive experiments were only carried out for composed neutral systems. A novel technique may allow to sensitively access
EDMs also for charged fundamental particles and ions. (Figure adapted from C.P. Liu33 )

has rather close lying states of opposite parity. This accidental almost
degeneracy of the 7s7p3P1 and 7s6d3D2 states has led to the prediction of
a signiﬁcant enhancement for an electron EDM 18 - much higher than for
any other atomic system. Further more, for many Ra isotopes their nuclei
fall are within in a region where (dynamic) octupole deformation occurs,
which also enhances the eﬀect of a nucleon EDM substantially, i.e. by some
two orders of magnitude 19. From a technical point of view the Ra atomic
levels of interest for an experiment are well accessible spectroscopically and
the isotopes can be produced in suﬃcient quantities in nuclear reactions.
The advantage of an accelerator based Ra experiment is apparent, because
nuclear EDMs are only possible nuclei with spin and all Ra isotopes with
no-vanishing nuclear spin are relatively short-lived.32

4.2. Searches for EDMs in charged Particles

A very novel idea was introduced recently for measuring an EDM of charged
particles directly. For such experiments the high motional electric ﬁeld is
exploited, which charged particles at relativistic speed experience in a mag-
netic storage ring. In such a setup the Schiﬀ theorem can be circumvented
(which had excluded charged particles from experiments due to the Lorentz
force acceleration), because of the non-trivial geometry of the problem28.
With an additional radial electric ﬁeld in the storage region the spin pre-
cession due to the magnetic moment anomaly can be compensated, if the
eﬀective magnetic anomaly aef f is small, i.e. aef f << 1.34

The method was ﬁrst considered for muons. For longitudinally polarized
muons injected into the ring an EDM would express itself as a spin rotation
out of the orbital plane. This can be observed as a time dependent (to ﬁrst
order linear in time) change of the above/below the plane of orbit counting
rate ratio. For the possible muon beams at the future J-PARC facility in
Japan a sensitivity of 10−24 e cm is expected 35,36. In such an experiment
the possible muon ﬂux is a major limitation. For models with nonlinear
mass scaling of EDM’s such an experiment would already be more sensitive
to some certain new physics models than the present limit on the electron
EDM 37. For certain Left-Right symmetric models a value of dµ up tp to
5 × 10−23 e cm would be possible. An experiment carried out at a more
intense muon source could provide a signiﬁcantly more sensitive probe to
CP violation in the second generation of particles without strangeness. e

The deuteron is the simplest known nucleus. Here an EDM could arise
not only from a proton or a neutron EDM, but also from CP-odd nuclear
forces 40. It was shown very recently 17 that the deuteron can be in certain
scenarios signiﬁcantly more sensitive than the neutron. In equation (1) this
situation is evident for the case of quark chromo-EDMs:

dD = −4.67 dc
dn = −0.01 dc

d + 5.22 dc
u ,
d + 0.49 dc
u .

(1)

It should be noted that because of its rather small magnetic anomaly the
deuteron is a particularly interesting candidate for a ring EDM experiment
and a proposal with a sensitivity of 10−27 e cm exists 41. In this case scat-
tering oﬀ a target will be used to observe a spin precession. As possible
sites of an experiment the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), the In-
diana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) and the Kernfysisch Versneller
Instituut (KVI) are considered.

5. T-violation Searches other than EDMs

Besides EDMs there exist more possibilities to ﬁnd T-Violation. Among
those certain correlation observables in β-decays oﬀer excellent opportu-
nities to ﬁnd such new sources.30,42,43 In β-neutrino correlations the ’D’-
coeﬃcient42 (for spin polarized nuclei) oﬀer a high potential to observe new
interactions in a region of potential New Physics which is less accessible by
EDM searches. However, the ’R’-coeﬃcient42 (observation of β-particle
polarization) would explore the same areas as present EDM searches or
β-decay asymmetry measurements. Such experiments are underway at a
number of laboratories worldwide43.

6. Conclusions

There is a large ﬁeld of searches for EDMs on a large number of systems.
Novel ideas have emerged in the recent past to use yet not studied sys-
tems and new experimental approaches, which have emerged in the recent

muon EDM dµ are real and imaginary part of a single complex quantity related through
µ /(3×10−9))×tan ΦCP e cm with a yet unknown CP violating phase
dµ = 3×10−22×(aNP
38,39, which cause diﬃculties for
ΦCP . The problems around the SM model value for aµ
the interpretation of the recent muon g-2 experiment in terms of limits for or indications
of New Physics, make a search for dµ attractive as an important alternative, as the SM
value is negligible for the foreseeable future.

past oﬀer excellent opportunities to complement the more traditional ex-
perimental approaches on neutron-, atom- and electron-EDMs, which have
yielded the best limits to date. Any successful search in the future will have
to be complemented by experiments on other systems in order to pin down
eventually the mechanisms leading to the observed EDMs.

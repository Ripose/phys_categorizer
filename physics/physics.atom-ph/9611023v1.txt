We show that zero ejection energy of the photoelectrons is classically impossible for hydrogen-like
ions, even when ﬁeld ionization occurs adiabatically. To prove this we transform the basic equations
to those describing two 2D anharmonic oscillators. The same method yields an alternative way to
derive the anomalous critical ﬁeld of hydrogen-like ions. The analytical results are conﬁrmed and
illustrated by numerical simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

A wealth of new phenomena in the interaction of strong, short laser pulses with matter has been found in recent
years [1,2]. Laser systems delivering pulses at irradiances up to 1019 Wcm−2µm2 are available in several laboratories.
Pulses not longer than a few tens of femtoseconds are “state of the art”. In describing their interaction with matter
usual perturbation theory fails since the electric ﬁeld of such laser pulses is of the order of the atomic ﬁeld. One
of the prominent phenomena occuring in a strong laser pulse is ﬁeld ionization. Here the electron is able to escape
over the barrier formed by the Coulomb potential and the laser ﬁeld. This process is much faster than tunneling
which is dominant in weaker ﬁelds. In other words, in intense laser ﬁelds the so-called barrier suppression ionization
(BSI) regime [3] is reached. In this regime, classical and semi-classical pictures are expected to work well and much
theoretical research has been done in that direction, both analytically [4–6] and numerically [7–11].

So-called “simple man’s theory” (SMT) [12–14] succeeded in explaining essential features of above threshold ion-
ization (ATI) (see e.g. [1,15] for an overview), such as cut-oﬀs in photoelectron energies and harmonic spectra [16].
Extensions to SMT considering rescattering eﬀects clariﬁed experimentally observed features such as plateaus in
ATI-spectra [17] and rings in the angular distributions [18].

However, no ionization dynamics enters in the SMT since the electron is regarded as being “born” in the laser
ﬁeld without perceiving any attraction by the ionic core anymore, at least until rescattering by the nucleus. Even in
Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR)-type theories [19–21] the Coulomb potential enters not directly but through the initial
energy state wave function.

For relevant applications, e.g. inverse bremsstrahlung, it is important to know the energy with which the electron
is freed (ejection energy) [22]. To calculate the latter the ionization dynamics must be described by solving the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation or by using simpler alternative concepts. In this paper a classical model is used
for this purpose.

For the sake of completeness, we brieﬂy review SMT. Suppose that a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld E(t) sets in at

t = 0, the velocity of a non-relativistic electron released at time t′ is at the instant t

The paper is organized as follows:

in Sec. II the anharmonic oscillator picture is introduced which leads to a
physically appealing interpretation of the adiabatic ionization process as discussed in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, the lower
limit for the ejection energy as well as the upper limit for the ejection radius is derived. It is further shown that no
upper limit for the ejection energy exists. In Sec. V the analytical results are conﬁrmed and illustrated by numerical
simulations. Sec. VI is devoted to a rederivation of the anomalous critical ﬁeld of hydrogen like ions [26] in the
framework of the anharmonic oscillator picture. The adiabatic deformation of the initial ground state is calculated
and compared with the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. Finally, we give our conclusion
in Sec. VII.

II. TRANSFORMING TO ANHARMONIC OSCILLATORS

The laser frequency Ω can be regarded as small compared to the orbital frequency ω of the bound electron (e.g.
Ω = 0.18 a.u. for KrF and Ω = 0.04 a.u. for Nd). Therefore, a quasi adiabatic treatment is appropriate. We will now
outline the transformation to a set of two 2D anharmonic oscillators [23].

We start with the Hamiltonian describing an electron in a Coulomb potential

which represents a set of two 2D anharmonic oscillators moving independently. There are only constraints concerning
the initial values of the system: (i) the energies must sum up to the given total “energy” Z, and (ii) the angular
momenta, which are constants of the motion, are equal.

III. PHYSICAL PICTURE

The physical interpretation of Eqs.(5) and (6) is very simple. Supposing g

motion in v, whereas the eﬀective potential in Eq.(5), Vu(u) = p2

Now, the ﬁeld g may be turned on adiabatically. Initially, when g = 0 holds, the v- and the u-motion take place in
equal potentials. While g increases, the u-potential is bent down whereas the v-potential is steepened. Therefore one
expects an adiabatic lowering of the energy A and an adiabatic raising of the level B (Fig. 1). But the frequency ω
may also change because the adiabatic invariant

yields a relation between g, A and ω only. Indeed, a change in ω is the classical dc Stark-shift, of course. The trick
is to consider the special Kepler orbit which ionizes earliest in an adiabatically ramped dc ﬁeld. Therefore, we switch
back to the “physical space” for a moment: the classical trajectory which ionizes ﬁrst is that one mostly directed
towards the potential barrier. There are two Kepler orbits lying on the z-axis in the limit eccentricity
1. One lies
in the region z
0,
0 does last. The two z-directed orbits are the extreme
the Kepler orbit z
Stark-shifted ones. The orbit which ionizes ﬁrst corresponds to the electron with smallest ejection energy. Therefore,
the ejection energy of just this electron provides a lower limit for all ejection energies which may occur. Fortunately,
this special energy can be calculated.

Now we turn back to the anharmonic oscillator picture: motion along the negative z-axis means v = pϕ = pϕ′ = 0
0. Now, when g is adiabatically ramped B
for all times. Therefore, the anharmonic oscillator Hv is frozen, i.e., B
is not adiabatically raised since the v-particle rests in the potential well and does not recognize the steepening of the
potential. It follows that B remains zero, and A
Z (Fig. 2). The adiabatic invariant (9) now provides a relation
between ω and g only, i.e., one can, in principal, calculate the classical Stark-shift ω2(g) for this particular orbit. The
Stark-shift is the key which enables us to calculate the lower limit for the ejection energy and the upper limit for the
ejection radius, as we will see in the following Section.

IV. CALCULATION OF THE EJECTION ENERGY

Since the integral in Eq.(9) can not be solved analytically some approximations must be applied. We will restrict
ourselves to the linear Stark-shift which follows from Eq.(9) when the integrand and the turning point is expanded in
powers of the ﬁeld g. The result corresponds to the quantum mechanical one in the limit of high quantum numbers,
n

0 is located at ub = ω/√g. The value of the potential at that point
is Vu(ub) = ω4/(4g). Since the kinetic energy is zero when the potential barrier meets the total energy A = Z for the
ﬁrst time (this is the case due to adiabaticity), one has

Numerically, the exact motion of an ensemble of electrons in a Coulomb potential and an electric ﬁeld can easily be
determined using the so-called “classical trajectory Monte Carlo-method” (CTMC) [25]. We have performed CTMC
runs and looked at each test electron when its Coulomb energy
E(t)z becomes positive, i.e., when the electron
would be free if the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ immediately (this is our deﬁnition of ionization).

In Fig.3 the kinetic ejection energy of each electron is indicated by a symbol over the ﬁeld strength where ionization
takes place (the ﬁeld is directly proportional to the time due to linear ramping) for Z = 1,

The anharmonic oscillator method provides also an elegant and alternative way to derive the anomalous critical ﬁeld
[26] for hydrogen-like ions. With the ansatz ψ(u, v, ϕ, ϕ′(ϕ)) = ψu(u) exp(imϕ)ψv(v) exp(im′ϕ′) the Hamiltonians (5)
and (6) lead to the following two Schr¨odinger equations

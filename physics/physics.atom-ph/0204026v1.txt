An optical microtrap is realized on a dielectric surface by crossing a tightly focused laser beam
with an horizontal evanescent-wave atom mirror. The nondissipative trap is loaded with ∼105
cesium atoms through elastic collisions from a cold reservoir provided by a large-volume optical
surface trap. With an observed 300-fold local increase of the atomic number density approaching
1014cm

−3, unprecedented conditions of cold atoms close to a surface are realized.

The trapping of cold atoms very close to material ob-
jects has attracted considerable interest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10] and opens up fascinating perspectives for a
great variety of experiments ranging from fundamental
studies of surface interactions to the realization of low-
dimensional quantum gases to applications in the ﬁeld
of quantum information processing. Material structures
that carry currents, produce electric ﬁelds, or transport
light are the key to realize novel trapping conﬁgurations
such as microtraps and integrated devices for atom op-

that connects the atomic quantum system to the environ-
ment with the prospect of gaining control and enabling
measurements on the quantum level.

For experiments in this research ﬁeld, various sur-
face trapping and guiding schemes have been devised:
Magneto-optical traps near surfaces [1, 3, 4], magnetic
surface traps and guides [4, 5, 6, 7], and optical dipole
traps and guides [1, 2] represent the three main classes.
Very recently magnetic surface traps could be combined
with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) [8, 9, 10]. While
in present magnetic surface trapping schemes the atomic
samples are still separated from the surface by typically
a few ten µm, optical schemes [1, 2, 11, 12] have already
trapped atoms much closer to the surface with distances
on the order of the optical wavelength and quasi-2D con-
ditions have been attained in low-density samples. Opti-
cal surface trapping ﬁelds thus oﬀer an intriguing poten-
tial for future nanotraps and guides based on integrated
optical waveguides [13].

In this Letter, we demonstrate a novel optical surface
trap based on an evanescent-wave (EW) atom mirror
in combination with a tightly focused red-detuned laser
beam; see Fig. 1. This optical dipole trap conﬁnes atoms
in a very small volume very close to a dielectric surface.
Eﬃcient loading through elastic collisions allows us to
trap a large number of atoms from an optically precooled
reservoir and thus to reach exceptionally high densities
even with a classical gas. This scheme also opens up
a possible new route for an all-optical production of a
Bose-Einstein condensate [14] with prospects for future
experiments on quantum-degenerate gases near the sur-
face.

tion of collisional microtrap loading, in which the horizontal
trapping potential is changed in three steps.

The starting point for our experiments with cesium
atoms is the “gravito-optical surface trap” [1, 11, 12].
This trap is realized under ultrahigh vacuum conditions
∼ 10−11 mbar) by combining the EW atom mirror
(p <
with a blue-detuned hollow beam (HB). The EW is pro-
duced with the 55-mW beam of a diode laser (SDL-5712-
H1) in a nearly round spot with a 1/e2-radius of 0.65 mm
on the surface of a fused-silica prism. The angle of in-
cidence is about 2◦ above the critical angle of total in-
ternal reﬂection and the polarization lies in the plane of
incidence. A heated cesium cell is used to ﬁlter reso-
nant background light out of this beam [11]. The HB
for horizontal conﬁnement is derived from a Ti:Sapphire
laser (Coherent 899-01/895) at a wavelength of 849 nm,
i.e. with a detuning of about ∼3 nm from the 852-nm
Cs resonance line.
It is shaped with a special axicon
optics [15] to provide a two-dimensional cylindrical box
potential. The HB has a total power of 330 mW, a di-
ameter of 820 µm, and a potential height on the order
of 100 µK. Typically 2 × 107 atoms are initially loaded

from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating a few mm
above the surface. First, the optical detuning of the EW
is set to 5 GHz to implement Sisyphus cooling by inelas-
tic reﬂections [1]. After 5 s of optical cooling the EW
detuning ∆νEW is increased in a 2-s linear ramp to a
large value in the range between 100 GHz and 200 GHz;
this frequency ramp is accomplished by rapid tempera-
ture tuning of the laser diode. In this way a conservative
trapping potential is realized with negligible photon scat-
tering and heating below 100 nK/s. The large detuning
also strongly reduces light-induced collisional loss in the
blue-detuned trap light [12].

Our surface reservoir prepared in this way contains
2 × 106 Cs atoms at a temperature of T ≈ 3 µK at
∆νEW = 160 GHz. The vertical density distribution fol-
lows the barometric equation with a 1/e-height of ∼20µm
[1] with a peak value close to the EW atom mirror of
2 × 1011cm−3. The peak phase-space density of the un-
polarized sample in the F = 3 ground state is ∼ 2 × 10−5,
where we assume that the sample at low magnetic ﬁeld
(<
∼ 5 µT) is equally distributed over the seven magnetic
substates. The elastic collision rate is of the order of
20 s−1, leading to a thermalization time of ∼0.5 s. At the
large EW detuning, the lifetime of the reservoir is limited
to typically 1.5 s. We believe that this is due to escape
through weaker regions of the EW potential barrier in
the Gaussian proﬁle and at local surface defects.

All measurements reported here are based on recaptur-
ing the atoms trapped on the EW atom mirror into the
MOT. The number of atoms is determined from the in-
tegrated ﬂuorescence detected with a carefully calibrated
CCD camera. For the absolute atom number we estimate
a calibration error below a factor of 1.5. The tempera-
ture is measured with a release-and-recapture method by
turning oﬀ the EW for a short time interval and measur-
ing the relative loss of atoms [1].

For implementing the surface microtrap we use the
beam of a Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm,
which is focused right into the center of the cesium en-
semble with a power of 330 mW and a waist of w0 =
32 µm. There it produces a Gaussian-shaped horizon-
tally attractive optical potential with a calculated depth
of a ˆU /kB = 48 µK [16].
In a harmonic approxi-
mation to the trap center the oscillation frequency is
ωr = (4 ˆU /mw2
0)1/2 = 2π × 540 Hz. After turning on
the Nd:YAG beam, this additional narrow potential well
is ﬁlled by thermalizing elastic collisions. Since the nar-
row well is deep compared with the temperature of the
reservoir ( ˆU /kBT ≈ 15) a very large increase of the lo-
cal density can be expected. After loading the Nd:YAG
beam the reservoir can be removed by shutting down the
HB. In this way, a very dense sample of atoms stored in
the surface microtrap is realized.

the reservoir (◦) and in the microtrap (•) together with ﬁts

text.

basic idea of a local gain by adiabatically changing the
potential shape was ﬁrst pointed out in [17]. Our scheme
is similar to the “dimple trap” desribed in [18] where an
optical dipole trap was combined with a magnetic trap
and a 50-fold increase in local phase-space density was
reached. We believe that this mechanisum also plays an
important role for trap loading in the all-optical BEC ex-
periment of Ref. 14, where two tightly focused CO2-laser
beams formed sort of a dimple in their crossing region.
The eﬃcient “dimple trick” may also ﬁnd very interest-
ing applications in context with degenerate Fermi gases
as suggested in [19].

In order to study the collisional loading process we
suddenly turn on the Nd:YAG beam after preparation
of the reservoir with ∆νEW = 120 GHz and T ≈ 4µK.
The measured number of atoms loaded into the mi-
crotrap with increasing time is displayed in Fig. 2 to-
gether with the number of reservoir atoms. The latter
is very well described by an exponential decay Nres =
Nres,0 exp(−t/τres) with Nres,0 = 3.5 × 106 and τres =
1.4 s. At zero loading time, a sudden transfer puts an
initial number of 4 × 104 atoms into the phase-space of
the microtrap. This transfer of ∼1% agrees very well
with a calculation of the sudden transfer ratio. Thermal-
izing elastic collisions then ﬁll the optical microtrap on
the timescale of a few 100 ms and the trapped number of
atoms reaches a maximum of ∼105 after about 500 ms.
The atomic ensemble in the microtrap then decays slower
than the reservoir, which is due to the high EW potential
barrier in the middle of the reservoir.

We can model the loading in a simple way by a dif-
ferential equation for the number N (t) of atoms in the
microtrap,

˙N = −κNres(N − aNres) − bN

2

.

This highly eﬃcient collisional loading scheme plays a
crucial role in our experiments as it leads to a drastic
local increase of number and phase-space density. The

The loading model is based on the experimental facts
that the temperature stays constant and that the micro-
trap does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the reservoir. By intro-

ducing the parameter a ≪ 1 we assume that thermaliza-
tion tends to load a certain fraction of the reservoir atoms
into the microtrap. The loading rate κNres is assumed to
be proportional to the elastic collision rate in the reser-
voir. For the loss out of the microtrap, we consider two-
body collisions as the main mechanism. The loss coeﬃ-
cient is determined independently to b = 7.2 × 10−6 s−1
by observing the decay in the absence of a reservoir
(Nres = 0). A ﬁt of N (t) to the experimental loading data
in Fig. 2 then yields κ = 3.3 × 10−7 s−1 and a = 0.08.
The resulting initial loading rate κNres,0 ≈ 1 s−1 is of
the same order as thermalization rate of the reservoir.
The parameter a ≈ 8 % indicates the thermal equilib-
rium transfer ratio into the microtrap, which exceeds the
sudden transfer by almost an order of magnitude.

The loaded atom number can be maximized by turning
on the Nd:YAG beam right after the optical cooling phase
at the begin of the 2-s EW detuning ramp. When right
after the ramp the HB is turned oﬀ and the reservoir
atoms completely disappear after 200ms, we observe up
to N = 1.5 × 105 atoms in the microtrap.

The density distribution can be calculated under the
assumption of thermal equilibrium from the potential
shape and the measured temperature. The trap shape
with its cylindrical symmetry is approximately harmonic
in the two dimensions of the horizontal x, y-plane and has
a one-dimensional wedge shape in the vertical z-direction.
In such a potential the density distribution can be de-
scribed by

n(r) = n0 exp(−ρ2/ρ2

0) exp(−z/z0)

(2)
where ρ2 = x2 + y2. The 1/e-decrease of the density is
characterized by a horizontal radius ρ0 = ω−1
r p2kBT /m
and a height z0 = kBT /mg; here m denotes the mass
of a Cs atom and g represents the gravitational accelera-
tion. With an eﬀective volume deﬁned as V0 = πρ2
0z0, the
peak number density n0 is related to the trapped atom
number and the eﬀective volume by n0 = N/V0. Note
that the mean density and the mean quadratic density
in this trapping potential are related to the peak density
by hni = n0/4 and hn2i = n2

0/9.
The eﬀective volume V0 occupied in the microtrap de-
pends on the horizontal trap frequency ωr and the tem-
perature T . Fig. 3 shows measurements of these two
quantities. In (a) the calculated value of ωr/2π = 540 Hz
is nicely conﬁrmed. In (b) the temperature measurement
shows T = 2.9 µK, obtained at ∆νEW = 160 GHz. These
measurements yield a horizontal 1/e-radius ρ0 = 6.1 µm,
a 1/e-height z0 = 19 µm and an eﬀective volume of
V0 = 2200µm3. With N = 1.5 × 105 atoms a peak den-
sity as high as 7 × 1013cm−3 is obtained. This number
is about 300 times higher as compared to our reservoir
and thus the largest gain realized by loading a “dimple”
[18]. The attained density also clearly exceeds the max-
imum values reported for Cs in previous dipole trapping
experiments [21, 22, 23]. The peak phase-space density

In both (a) and (b) the atom number is normalized to the
number measured without interruption of the trapping ﬁelds.

for a fully unpolarized sample in F = 3 is calculated
to 7 × 10−3. The very high elastic collison rate in the
dense sample exceeds 2 kHz and a posteriori justiﬁes the
assumption of a thermal equilibrium distribution.

In order to investigate trap loss at these high den-
sities we have measured the number of stored atoms
as a function of time. The corresponding experimental
data are shown in Fig. 4. Trap loss can be described
by ˙N /N = −α − βhni − K3hn2i, where α is a density-
independent loss rate and the coeﬃcients β and K3 char-
acterize two-body and three-body inelastic trap loss. For
our trap the mean density and mean quadratic density
can be written as hni = N/(4V0) and hn2i = N 2/(9V 2
0 ),
so that the loss equation yields a diﬀerential equation
for N (t). An attempt to ﬁt the observed decay with α,
β, and K3 as free parametes in addition to the initial
particle number N (t = 0) gives ambiguous results. We
therefore vary α as an external parameter in a reason-
able range (α ≤ 0.1 s−1) and obtain good ﬁt results for β
and K3 (see solid line in Fig. 4). In this way we obtain

A very interesting further prospect would then be to load
the dense gas into a two-dimensional trap formed by two
evanescent waves [25] and to study the properties of a
two-dimensional surface gas of Cs atoms with their large
and tunable interactions.

In summary, by loading an optical surface microtrap
through elastic collisions from a reservoir we have locally
increased the number and phase-space density by a factor
of up to 300. This demonstrates a very eﬃcient and
universal loading scheme for nondissipative microtraps
or future nanotrapping schemes at surfaces. Moreover it
opens up new possibilities to create a degenerate gas of Cs
atoms and to create a two-dimensional surface quantum
gas with tunable interactions.

a two-body loss coeﬃcient of ∼ 5 × 10−14cm3/s together
with an upper bound for the three-body coeﬃcient of
∼ 3 × 10−27cm6/s. According to previous experi-
K3 <
ments [12] the value for β indeed corresponds to an ex-
pected loss coeﬃcient for light-induced inelastic collisions
in the ﬁeld of the evanescent wave involving the excita-
tion of repulsive molecular states. The upper bound for
three-body loss appears to be surprisingly low regarding
the resonant scattering properties of Cs [24].

In another series of experiments, we have tried to fur-
ther increase the phase-space density by evaporative cool-
ing. For this purpose, we have lowered the intensity of
the Nd:YAG beam in an exponential ramp with variable
time constants. An optimum result, obtained with a 400-
ms ramp down to 10% of the initial intensity is shown in
Fig. 5. After 350ms of the ramp, with a potential depth
reduced to ∼7µK the temperature reaches values slightly
below 1 µK as a result of combined adiabatic and evapo-
rative cooling. With about 4 × 104 atoms remaining, the
phase-space density of the unpolarized gas in its seven
magnetic substates reaches values slightly above 10−2.
Further reduction of the intensity leads to increased loss,
but not to lower temperatures. This indicates that evap-
oration under our conditions is limited by inelastic loss,
which is being studied in more detail in ongoing experi-
ments.

A great improvement of evaporative cooling in our mi-
crotrap can be expected with polarized atoms in the low-
est internal state F = 3, mF = 3 at appropriate values
of a magnetic ﬁeld. A factor of seven will be gained
in phase-space density at the same number density and
temperature. Inelastic collisions involving changes of the
magnetic quantum numbers and the release of Zeeman
energy will be energetically suppressed. Moreover, the
scattering length can be tuned into a positive region for

tion, a further factor of about 30 in phase-space density
and the attainment of Cs-BEC in an optical surface trap
seems feasible with an appropriate evaporation strategy.

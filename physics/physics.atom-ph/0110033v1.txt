Electron trajectory in the hydrogen atom

A trajectory in the Schr¨odinger wave for an electron in an attractive Coulomb potential with
the dynamical behavior is proposed and illustrated for a scattering and a bound state. The
scattering cross section derived from the trajectories is almost exactly equal to that from the
usual wave theory. The statistical nature of the result is examined. The period of one cycle in
the bound state is exactly equal to that of the corresponding classical motion.

1 Introduction

Nowadays, we can move an atom to put on the arbitrary positions on metal. We can measure
whether one electron adhered to the capacitor. There is no uncertainty to operate one atom. We also
have ascertained that there is no indeterminacy on determining a submicron diameter by a longer
wavelength laser precisely. [1] It would be one of the urgent requisites to make a dynamical equation
of motion of an atomic scale ‘particle’ without any contradiction to the wave theory.

The trajectory of the harmonic oscillator in the wave equation has been discussed. [2] Since the
system treats only the bound state, the statistical nature, one of the important characteristics, in
quantum theory can not be seen clearly. In the present paper, by using the method of the mcf [2, 3],
a trajectory of an electron in an attractive Coulomb potential, like the hydrogen atom in a state with
a positive or negative energy, is proposed. On discussing the cross section for the scattering state, the
statistical but in principle determinate nature like classical mechanics will be seen as an illustration.
In section 2 the dynamical theory that would lead to a trajectory is described. The traveling
waves and usual stationary wave functions are discussed. In section 3 the trajectory of an electron in
the scattering state by the Coulomb potential is investigated. In sections 4 and 5 the cross section
and the ﬂux of the beam of particles are discussed. In section 6 the trajectory of an electron in the
hydrogen atom in a bound state is analyzed and illustrated. Conclusion and remarks on the wave
functions are given in section 7.

2 Dynamics and wave function

The dynamics that leads to the mode trajectory of an electron in an attractive Coulomb potential
with a charge e(> 0) is summarized. [3] The wave function Ψ describing the motion of an electron

where E, α and β are constants of separation, and E is assumed to be the energy of the system. These
constants should be called mode parameters. The wave function of the form

is sought, where functions Pj ’s and Wj ’s are real. This should be called a traveling wave. Let functions

classical region stands for the domain in which the chracteristic function holds true.

If Wj ’s are found uniquely, the sum of them

W (x1, x2, x3, E, α, β) = W1(x1, E, α) + W2(x2, α, β) + W3(x3, β)

is named the mode characteristic function (mcf) for the system.

Eqs. (7) should be called the mode trajectory.

The square integrable wave function is obtained as follows. Let the endpoints of the xj coordinate

Scattering state

The scattering state of an electron in the Coulomb potential is analyzed in the spherical polar coor-
dinate system. The wave function Ψ(r, t) is expressed in the spherical polar coordinates with mode
parameters, E, ν and µ as

Ψ(r, t) = exp (
Φ(r, E) = R(r, E, ν)Y (θ, ν, µ) exp(iµφ).

Constant E stands for the energy and ¯hν for the orbital angular momentum, and ¯hµ represents the
component of the angular momentum along the polar axis. When ν and µ are integral numbers, they
are usual azimuthal and magnetic quantum numbers as will be seen in Eqs. (15) and (21). [6]

The mcf expressed in terms of the spherical polar coordinates are obtained as follows. The function

The equations of the trajectory prescribed above are more easily seen if the approximate relation
(20) is used. It shows that coordinate φ is constant except the point of ρπ and θ = π, where it jumps
by π. This indicates that the trajectory is almost on a plane like the classical orbit.

An example of a trajectory of the electron with parameters ηs = 3.3, ν = 2.2, µ = 1.1,, projected

on a plane, is shown with the corresponding classical orbit with ηs = 3.3, l = 2.7, µ = 1.1, in Fig. 1.

The corresponding classical orbit, as is well known, is very similar to this trajectory except the

neighborhood of the origin.

According to the interpretation envisaged with Gordon’s work, the deviated beam should be
obtained through the scattering of incident particles with various impact parameters. The outgoing
ﬂux is considered to be an assemblage of particles which, in classical mechanicsl sense, should be
governed by a plausible causal dynamics.

In the present treatment, the associated wave with the motion of an electron with ηs, ν and µ = 0,

may be expressed, for r large, as

6 Bound state

An electron trajectory in a hydrogen atom in a bound state is analyzed. The solution of the form of
expressions (13) and (14) with energy E negative is sought. The mcf in the θ coordinate space, Wθ,
is the same in the preceding section, (17).

The traveling wave in the radial coordinate is obtained from Eq. (31) with replacement of iηs or

iρ by

η or ρ, respectively. By writing u(r, E, ν) = rR(r, E, ν), a traveling wave is obtained

The asymptotic forms of Wr at r = 0 or r =

The mcf for the system is given by Eq. (39) with expression (77) in place of (32). The trajectory
of an electron in a bound ‘mode’ (E, ν, µ) should be given by Eqs. (7) with the same replacement of
the variables and parameters as mentioned for the scattering state.

A computer calculation shows that these derivatives ∂Wr/∂E, and ∂Wr/∂ν, are monotonic with
respect to r. The variation of the derivative ∂Wr/∂ν between r = 0 and
cancels out that of the
derivative ∂Wθ/∂ν between θ = 0 and π. It is thus found that the electron moves between r = 0 and

, accompanying with a translation between θ = 0 and π.
The trajectory of an electron in a bound state is given as follows. By assuming the origin to

point of the trajectory, the mcf for the motion from r = 0 to r =

is the right one and the mcf could be determined uniquely for the system with the mode parameters.
A trajectory of an electron in a bound state thus determined is illustrated for the ‘mode’ with
parameters η = 3, ν = 2, µ = 1, and φ0 = 0 at t = t0 in Fig. 4.

the corresponding classical orbit resembles more to the trajectory as the mode parameters η and ν

7 Conclusion

A trajectory of the electron in an attractive Coulomb potential has been shown. The trajectory
It runs also through a
resembles well the orbit of the corresponding state in classical mechanics.
tunneling region. The trajectory has been derived from the mode characteristic function (mcf) which
is an extenstion of the Hamilton characteristic function. The period of the round trip motion of the
electron in the bound state is the same as that of the corresponding classical motion with the same
mode parameters. The accordance of the characteristics between classical and quantum mechanics
suggests the validity of the mcf and the dynamics deﬁned.

It is to be noted that all solutions of the wave equation including waves diverging at singular points
of the wave equation are necessary to derive the mcf. This suggests the role of all the solutions of the
wave equation. It has been found that if the wave equation is decomposed into a set of single-variables
r, θ and φ, the resulting diﬀerential equations of 2nd order have each mcf uniquely, which should lead
to a mode trajectory of an electron with some dynamical assumptions.

The wave function ﬁnite everywhere for any scattering or bound state is made by superposing the
traveling waves associated with the electron motion. It is not always continuous for any bound state.
The requirement that the wave function be continuous or uniqely determined at any point of the
coordinate is equivalent to that the diﬀerence between the mcf’s at endpoints be a multiple of π. It
leads to that the mode parameters are integral numbers and the eigenvalus of the physical quantities
become discrete.

The discussion on the cross section and the ﬂux suggests that the statistical nature of the wave
theory stems from the fact that the wave consists of waves associated with the particle motion with
each mode parameter which is causally determined. Not all the characteristics of statistical nature of
the wave mechanics have been examined but this may be one of the most important characteristics.
These results indicate the consistent existence of the trajectory in wave mechanics and suggest a
signiﬁcance about the relation between a particle motion and a traveling wave function as an extension
of the de Broglie postulate.

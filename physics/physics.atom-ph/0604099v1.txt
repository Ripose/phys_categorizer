Stark-induced amplitudes for the 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 transition in Tl I are calculated using the rela-
tivistic SD approximation in which single and double excitations of Dirac-Hartree-Fock levels are
summed to all orders in perturbation theory. Our SD values αS = 368 a3
0 are
in good agreement with the measurements αS=377(8) a3
0 by D. DeMille, D.
Budker, and E. D. Commins [Phys. Rev. A50, 4657 (1994)]. Calculations of the Stark shifts in the
6P1/2 − 7P1/2 and 6P1/2 − 7S1/2 transitions are also carried out. The Stark shifts predicted by our
calculations agree with the most accurate measured values within the experimental uncertainties for
both transitions.

INTRODUCTION

was ∆νS = -112(6) kHz/(kV/cm)2.

The 293 nm 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 transition in thallium
has been studied extensively both experimentally and
theoretically because of its connection to atomic par-
ity nonconservation (PNC). Although 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 is
nominally a magnetic dipole (M1) transition, there is
also an electric dipole (E1) component arising from
the weak interaction mediated by Z0 exchange be-
tween the nucleus and bound electrons. The weak
E1 component of the 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 transition is cal-
ibrated using the Stark-induced amplitude βS. Mea-
sured values of both αS = 2.01(4)×10−5µB cm/V and
βS = 1.67(4)×10−5µB cm/V for the 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 tran-
sition in thallium were reported by DeMille et al. [1]
and found to be in substantial disagreement with ear-
lier measurements αS = 1.31(6)×10−5µB cm/V and
βS = 1.09(5)×10−5µB cm/V by Tanner and Commins
[2]. It was pointed out in Ref. [3] that both the Stark
shift and the Stark-induced amplitude could be measured
in the same transition in which PNC is measured [4].

High-precision measurements of the Stark shift within
the 378 nm 6P1/2−7S1/2 E1 transition in atomic thallium
were recently reported by Doret et al. [3]. The result
∆νS = -103.23(39) kHz/(kV/cm)2 had higher accuracy
by factor of 15 than earlier measurements [1, 5]. The
earlier value for the 6P1/2 − 7S1/2 transition from Ref. [1]

In the present paper, we carry out relativistic all-order
calculations of Stark-induced amplitudes αS and βS for
the 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 transition as well as Stark shifts within
both 6P1/2−7S1/2 and 6P1/2−7P1/2 transitions in atomic
thallium. The calculations are carried out using the rel-
ativistic SD all-order method in which single and double
excitations of Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) wave functions
are summed to all orders in perturbation theory. Re-
cently, lifetimes, E1, E2, and M1 transition rates, hy-
perﬁne constants, and excitation energies of the nPJ ,
nS1/2, and nDJ states in neutral thallium were evalu-
ated by Safronova et al. [6], using both relativistic many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT) and the relativistic
SD method. The SD calculations were found to be in
excellent agreement with the best available experimental
data.

II. STARK-INDUCED AMPLITUDE OF THE
6P1/2 − 7P1/2 TRANSITION IN THALLIUM

Stark-induced scalar and vector polarizabilities αS and
βS for transitions in Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr were calcu-
lated in the SD approximation by Safronova et al. [7].
Following the procedure used in [6], we treat Tl I as a
one-valence-electron atom with a Hg-like core and eval-
uate the Stark-induced scalar and vector polarizabilities
αS and βS following the procedures used in [7] for alkali-
metal atoms.

The quantities Zwv in the above equations are electric-

elements are calculated as [6]

where zwv is the lowest-order (DHF) matrix element and
the terms Z (k), k = a · · · t are linear or quadratic func-
tion of the SD excitation coeﬃcients. The normalization
terms Nw are quadratic functions of the excitation co-
eﬃcients. The SD matrix elements include all MBPT
corrections through third order together with important
classes of forth- and higher-order corrections.

where N is the number of the ﬁnite basis set states. The
calculation of βS is conducted in the same way.

We use B-splines [8] to generate a complete set of DHF
basis orbitals for use in the evaluation of all electric-
dipole matrix elements. Here, we use here N = 50
splines (compared with 40 used in [6]) for each angu-
lar momentum. The basis orbitals are constrained to
a cavity of radius R = 90 (a.u.). The size of the cav-
ity is taken to be large enough to ﬁt all of the states
needed for the calculation of the main terms for all of
the polarizabilities calculated in this work. Furthermore,
we use the Breit-Dirac-Hartree-Fock (BDHF) approxi-
mation here instead of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF)
approximation used in Ref. [6] because we found that
the Breit contributes about 1% to the values of αS and
βS at the DHF level. The BDHF approximation includes
the the one-body part of the Breit interaction in the DHF
equation (for more detail see Refs. [9, 10]). The one-body
part of the Breit interaction is also included in the equa-
tions that generate DHF basis orbitals.
In fact, all of
the calculations in this work, including the calculations
of the tail contributions, are done with same basis set.

The sums over n in Eqs. (1, 2) converge rapidly; there-
fore, only main term contributions have to be calculated
accurately. We calculate main terms for αS and βS using
SD matrix elements and experimental energies [11]. The

contribution of the remainder, while small, is not negli-
gible for n < 20 and is calculated in the random-phase
approximation (RPA) for these states. It is essentially
zero for larger n and is evaluated in the DHF approxi-
mation for n ≥ 20 without loss of accuracy. We ﬁnd that
it is essential to use RPA approximation to evaluate the
tail contribution for αS as DHF calculation signiﬁcantly
overestimates the tail yielding −25 a3
0 while RPA calcu-
lation gives −16 a3
0. DHF approximation is expected to
signiﬁcantly overestimate the value of the tail contribu-
tion as it signiﬁcantly overestimates the value of the main
term. The autoionizing contribution is very small, 0.1%,
for αS and is negligible at the present level of accuracy
for βS. It is evaluated in the DHF approximation.

In Tables I and II, we present the details of our αS
and βS calculations for the transition between the ground
state 6P1/2 and the excited 7P1/2 state in Tl I. We sepa-
rate the contributions from the nS and nD3/2 terms given
by the Eqs. (1, 2). Furthermore, the contribution from
each n in the Eq. (5) for the main term is given sep-
arately in the corresponding (nlj) row to demonstrate
rapid convergence of the sums in Eqs. (1, 2). The tail
contributions for nS and nD3/2 sums are listed in the
rows following the corresponding main term. The total
contribution from the core-excited autoionizing states are
listed in rows labeled δαcore
of Tables I and
II, respectively.

We list the values of the reduced electric-dipole ma-

energies contribute to αS and βS, we do not repeat the
energy and matrix element values in Table II. We use
recommended values of energies from the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database [11]
when calculating all of the polarizability values in this
work. The corresponding energy diﬀerences are listed in
columns two and three of Table I. Electric-dipole ma-
trix elements evaluated using the SD all-order method
(Eq. (3)) are given in columns labeled Zwv. It should be

noted that the values of Zwv given in Table I generally
diﬀer by 0.4–1.0% from the values of Zwv presented in
Ref. [6]. These diﬀerences arise because we include the
Breit interaction here and, to the lesser extent, because
of more accurate basis set used in the present work.

We also conducted a semiempirical scaling procedure,
described for example, in Refs. [7, 12], for three transi-
tions, 7S − 7P1/2, 7S − 7P3/2, and 7P1/2 − 6D3/2. These
transitions give signiﬁcant contributions to the αS and
βS as well as Stark shifts that we discuss below. The
scaling is carried out by multiplying the values of the
corresponding single valence excitation coeﬃcients by the
ratio of the theoretical and experimental correlation en-
ergies and repeating the calculation of the matrix ele-
ments with the modiﬁed excitation coeﬃcients. Study
of the breakdown of the correlation corrections showed
that the dominant contribution to the correlation correc-
tion to the values of these matrix elements comes from
a single term that contains only single valence excitation
coeﬃcients.
It has been shown that the scaling works
eﬀectively in such cases (see, for example [13, 14]) since
it is speciﬁcally aimed at correcting the dominant con-
tribution.
In the case of the 7S − 7P transitions, the
correlation breakdown is the same as in Cs, where the
scaled values are in excellent agreement with the high-
precision experiment. The scaling can not be applied
to improve the values of the 6D3/2 − 6P1/2 matrix ele-
ment as the the corresponding correlation correction is
not dominant, leading to possibly reduced accuracy of
this transition in comparison to 7S − 7P1/2, 7S − 7P3/2,
and 7P1/2 − 6D3/2 ones.

We ﬁnd that the contribution of the 6D3/2 term from
Eqs. (1, 2) dominates the values of αS and βS. While
all valence terms contributing to αS have the same sign,
there is signiﬁcant cancellation of terms contributing to
βS.
In fact, all nS terms contribute with the sign op-
posite to that of the nD3/2 terms with the exception of
the ﬁrst ones, 7S and 6D3/2. Owing to this cancellation,
our value of βS may be somewhat less accurate than the
value of αS.

In Table III, we compare our results for the Stark-
induced scalar and vector polarizabilities for the 6P1/2 −
7P1/2 transition in Tl with experimental measurements
by DeMille et al. [1] and Tanner and Commins [2]. The
conversion factor between the units of (µB/c) (cm/V)
used in Refs. [1, 2] and atomic units used in the present
work is 10−2αEh/2ea0=1.8762×107, where Eh is Hartree

energy. Our results support the measurements of DeMille
et al. [1] and clearly disagree with the measurements re-
ported by Tanner and Commins [2]. Our value of αS is
nearly within the experimental uncertainty of the Ref. [1]
measurement and our value of βS diﬀers from the central
experimental value of Ref. [1] by 2σ. As we discussed
above, accurate calculation of βS is more diﬃcult owing
to the cancellation of the nS and nD3/2 contributions.

III. STARK SHIFT WITHIN THE 6P1/2 − 7S1/2
AND 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 TRANSITIONS IN ATOMIC
THALLIUM

We calculate the Stark shifts within the 6P1/2 − 7S1/2
and 6P1/2 − 7P1/2 transitions as a diﬀerences of scalar
dipole polarizabilities α of the 6P1/2 ground state and
the 7S1/2 or 7P1/2 excited states. The expression for α
is given by (see, for example, Refs. [5, 15]):

α(n0P1/2) =

IS(nS1/2) + IS(nD3/2)

α(n0S1/2) =

IS(nP1/2) + IS(nP3/2)

Our results for the 6P1/2, 7P1/2, and 7S1/2 polarizabili-
ties are given in Tables IV and V where we use the same
designations as in the previous section. The polarizabil-
ity αcore of the Hg-like ionic core is also evaluated using
RPA approximation. A more detailed discussion for the
αcore in Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr atomic systems is found
in Ref. [7]. We note that contributions from αcore cancel
when we evaluate the Stark shift for a transition.

Only the polarizability contributions are listed in Ta-
ble IV, since all relevant energies and electric-dipole ma-
trix elements are already listed in Table I. The calcula-
tion of the 7S1/2 polarizabilities involves the calculation
of other series of the matrix elements, 7S − nP1/2 and
7S − nP3/2. We list those values, calculated using SD
all-order method, together with the corresponding en-
ergy diﬀerences taken from [11] in Table V.

The value of the 6P1/2 polarizability has two domi-
nant (and nearly equal) contributions, from 6P1/2−6D3/2
and 6P1/2 − 7S transitions. The value of the 7P1/2
polarizability is dominated by the contribution from
7P1/2 −6D3/2 transition. The value of the 7S polarizabil-
ity is dominated entirely by the contributions from both
7S −7P transitions. As we have discussed above, we con-
ducted more accurate calculation of the 7P1/2 − 6D3/2,
7S−7P1/2, and 7S−7P3/2 electric-dipole matrix elements
by rescaling the single valence excitation coeﬃcients with
the correct value of the correlation energy leading to more
accurate evaluation of the dominant contributions to 7S

factor between the ∆νS in kHz/(kV/cm)2 units used in

h is the Plank constant. Our result for the 6P1/2 − 7S1/2
Stark shift agrees with the most accurate, 0.4%, exper-
imental value from Ref. [3] within the experimental un-
certainty. The all-order value of the Stark shift for the
6P1/2 − 7P1/2 transition also agrees with the experiment
within the experimental uncertainty. We note that this
comparison essentially tests the accuracy of the 7S and
7P1/2 polarizability calculations since the ground state
polarizability is small comparing to the excited state po-
larizabilities.

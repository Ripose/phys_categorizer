Abstract

The calculated double diﬀerential cross sections for 60eV energy, where the cross
sections are also maximum, agree with the measure results of Shyn (1992) in a much
better way compaired to other theories for such energies.

With the availability of of results of some recent calculations of Bray (2002) and
R¨oder et al (2003) and Das et al (2003 a,b) the status of theoretical studies has reached
a new epoch. Even then much remains to be done. For example, although the con-
vergent close coupling (CCC) approach (Bray, 2000) gives beautifully the total, single,
and the triple diﬀerential cross sections (for some kinematic conditions), it miserably
fails in reproducing the double diﬀerential cross sections (DDCS) for intermediate and
high energies. As regards the DDCS results the same is true for 3C theory (Berakdar
and Klar,1993). Results of external complex scaling (ECS) approach , now a famous
approach, are not available, possibly due to diﬃculties. In this letter we present DDCS
results of a calculation in hyperspherical partial wave approach (HPW) for 60eV energy,
a typical intermediate energy, for which the cross sections are known to have maximum
values.

The hyperspherical partial wave approach has been described in detail in (Das et
al,2003a) and also in greater detail in (Das,1998). In this approach the scattering state
wave function is expanded in symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics (Das,1998; Das et
al,2003a) resulting in sets of inﬁnite coupled equations in inﬁnite number of radial wave
functions in hyper radius R. After truncating these equations to some ﬁnite N L
mx numbers
keeping the same number of radial wave functions one has to solve these over the semi-
inﬁnite interval (0, ∞) . In this calculation we have chosen N L
mx =40 for L=0 and 1 and
N L
mx =80 for other L values. Here L values up to 12 has been found to be practically
suﬃcient. For convenience in solution of the equations over (0, ∞ ) we divide it into
three subintervals (0, ∆ ), (∆, R∞ ), (R∞, ∞ ). As usual we have chosen ∆ , 5.0 a.u..
The asymptotic range parameter R∞ has to be properly chosen. We have set our codes
in such a way that this parameter R∞ may be made to take values thousands of atomic
units. This is possible only for another approach, the hyperspherical R-matrix method
with semi classical outgoing waves (HRM-SOW) approach of Malegat et al(2000). Now
inclusion of a large number of L values, at the same time makes the calculation very time
consuming. So with our moderate resources we have included values of L up to 12 and
chosen R∞ about 300 a.u.. With this choice we have moderately converged results.

In our present calculation our main interest is in the DDCS results. However we have
also calculated single and total ionization cross sections to have a complete picture. The
single diﬀerential cross sections have approximately converged except at the two ends,
where energy of one of the electrons is below 2eV and where contamination with high
Rydberg states gives unacceptable very high cross section results as in ECS calculation
by Flux method (Baertschy et al 2001).

In ﬁgure 1 we have presented the calculated SDCS results, fourth order parabolic
ﬁtted cross section curves (singlet, triplet and total) have also been included. From
these ﬁtted SDCS results total cross sections (singlet, triplet and their sum) have also
been calculated, as also the asymmetry parameter A. These results have been presented
in table 1. Finally in ﬁgure 2 we have presented the DDCS results which is our main

objective, here DDCS results have been normalized in a way that the integrated single
diﬀerential cross sections agree with the parabolic ﬁtted values. The results beautifully
agree with the measured results for energies below 6eV of the ejected electron. Particu-
larly the agreement with experiment for 3eV and 4eV are remarkable (see ﬁg.2). Here the
normalization factors are also very close to unity. No earlier calculation could produce
such accurate results (see for example ﬁgures 8 and 12 of Bray (2000) and ﬁgures 5-7
of Berakdar and Klar (1993) for some other intermediate values. Unfortunately their
results for this particular energy of 60eV are not available.

In conclusion it may be said that the hyperspherical partial wave theory is successful
in reproducing the DDCS results, generally, in a far better manner compared to other
theories. If we recall its capability in describing ionization events from close to threshold
(viz. 1eV, 0.5eV and 0.3eV excess energies as in Das et al 2003b) to a few Rydberg
energy (Das 2002; Das et al 2003a) and the present one then the hyperspherical partial
wave theory may be claimed to have an edge over other theories. With the availability of
better computational facilities this claimed may be better established. More experimen-
tal results, both double and triple diﬀerential cross sections, for intermediate energies
are urgently needed for better assessment of diﬀerent sophisticated theories.

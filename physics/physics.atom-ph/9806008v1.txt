(Abstract) The ordinary Schr¨odinger equation with minimal coupling
for a nonrelativistic electron interacting with a single-mode photon ﬁeld
is not satisﬁed by the nonrelativistic limit of the exact solutions to the
corresponding Dirac equation. A Schr¨odinger-like equation valid for
arbitrary photon intensity is derived from the Dirac equation without
the weak-ﬁeld assumption. The ”eigenvalue” in the new equation is an
operator in a Cartan subalgebra. An approximation consistent with the
nonrelativistic energy level derived from its relativistic value replaces
the ”eigenvalue” operator by an ordinary number, recovering the or-
dinary Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equation used in the formal scattering
formalism. The Schr¨odinger-like equation for the multimode case is
also presented.

The exact analytical solutions for an electron interacting with a
photon ﬁeld play a very important role in theories and calculations of
multiphoton ionization (MPI) and multiphoton scattering processes [1-
8]. These theoretical results have achieved notable agreements [2,4,8]
with experiments done during late 1980s [9-11]. However, rigorously
speaking, the theoretical treatments for a nonrelativistic (NR) electron
interacting with a photon ﬁeld [3-6] had a logical loophole; the purpose
of this note is to ﬁll this loophole. A bonus of our eﬀorts is the derivation
of a Schr¨odinger-like equation for an NR electron interacting with a
photon ﬁeld that is valid for arbitrary photon intensity (within the
range consistent with the NR motion of the electron).

Before proceeding to formal considerations, let us ﬁrst point out an
important feature of the MPI phenomenon. Namely, the total energy
of the photons interacting with the electron in a strong radiation ﬁeld
can be comparable to the electron mass. For example, the photon
energy of 1064 nm is of the order 1 eV , when the laser intensity is
of the order 1013 watt/cm2, the ponderomotive number is of order of
unity. This number is the photon number in a disc volume Vp with
thickness as the electron classical radius rc and the cross section made
by the radius of the photon circular wavelength λ/2π. The interaction
volume of an atomic electron V can be regarded as a disk volume with
the thickness as the Bohr radius and the same cross section of Vp.
Thus, V = 1372Vp. At the mentioned intensity the background photon
104 eV .
number is about 2
If one increases the intensity of the light with the same wavelength to
1014 watt/cm2, the total interacting background photon energy
2.5
will be around the electron mass. So the weak-ﬁeld approximation used
in the usual quantum electrodynamics does not apply here. We are
confronting the problem to get a non-relativistic approximation with
arbitrary photon intensity. The problem addressed in this paper is
realistic and in the range of current experiments.

The previous treatments [3-8] of the MPI theory adopt a second-
quantized formulation for the laser ﬁeld. The equations of motion,
in the Heisenberg picture, for a relativistic (ﬁrst-quantized) electron
interacting with a photon ﬁeld is the well-known Dirac equation which,
say for the case of a single-mode laser, reads

(1)

where

(2)

A(kx) = g(ǫae−ikx + ǫ∗a†eikx),
with a and a†, respectively, the photon annihilation and creation op-
erator, and g = (2Vγω)−1/2, Vγ being the normalization volume of the
photon ﬁeld, and the polarization four-vector ǫ = (0, ǫ). The Dirac
equation has been solved exactly either with a single-mode photon ﬁeld
[1] or with a multimode photon ﬁeld which propagates in one direction
[7]. The NR limit of these exact solutions has been derived in ref. [2],
and one is tempted to use them in the the theory for MPI in which the
emitted electrons are nonrelativistic.

As usual, the MPI theory started with the ordinary Schr¨odinger
equation with the standard minimum coupling [12], which in the
Schr¨odinger picture was the eigenvalue equation

The angle ξ determines the degree of polarization, such that ξ = π/2
corresponds to circular polarization and ξ = 0, to linear polarization.
(The phase angle Θ/2 is introduced to characterize the initial phase
value of the photon mode in an earlier work [3]. With this phase, a
full ”squeezed light” transformation [13] can be fulﬁlled in the solution
process. In multimode cases, the relative value of this phase for each
mode will be important.)

In the following, we ﬁrst show that the Schr¨odinger eigenvalue
equation (3) with the NR Hamiltonian (4) is not satisﬁed by the NR
wavefunctions obtained from the exact solutions to the corresponding
Dirac equation (1). To see this, let us remove the coordinate dependence
of the A(

Now we note that the term (kNa)2
kNa in Eqs. (9) and (11)
does not exist in the Dirac equation (1) and its squared form, which
contain the creation and annihilation operators only up to quadratic
terms. The exact solutions to the Dirac equation and their NR limit
were obtained from the photon Fock states, i.e. the number states, by
only ”squeezed light” and ”coherent light” transformations [1]. Any
equation satisﬁed by these states can consist of operators a or a† only
up to quadratic ones. Thus, the known NR wavefunctions [16] do not
satisfy the NR Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equation (3).

To justify the use of the NR wavefunctions, one of the authors has
introduced a special ansatz [3] which allows the replacement in Eq. (11)
of the kNa terms by κk with κ a real number to be determined. The
implicit assumption behind this ansatz is that the corrections caused
by this replacement should be at most comparable to relativistic ef-
fects. With this ansatz and certain covariance requirements, the so-
lutions turned out to be just the NR wavefunctions obtained by the
NR limit from the exact solutions of the Dirac equations. Later, the
ansatz was extended to the cases of multimode photon ﬁelds with mul-
tiple propagation directions [3,4,6]. Though this procedure leads to the
correct NR wavefunctions in the single-mode case, the reasons why the
ansatz works were not explained. Moreover, the validity of using the
Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equation to describe an NR electron in a strong
photon ﬁeld and the validity of the ansatz in multimode cases have
never been rigorously justiﬁed.

Unlike the classical-ﬁeld treatment, where the light ﬁeld is treated
as an external ﬁeld, our quantum ﬁeld-theoretical approach for photons

5

(13)

(14)

requires a careful treatment to maintain relativistic invariance for the
photon ﬁeld, while only the electron is to be considered as an NR par-
ticle. The correct equation of motion should be derived from the Dirac
equation in the Schr¨odinger picture:

We emphasize that the Schr¨odinger-like equation (19) that we have
derived in the NR limit is not an ordinary eigenvalue equation, since
“eigenvalue” (19′) is an operator (rather than a real number), which
is a quadratic element in the commuting subalgebra generated by Na
in the enveloping algebra of a and a†. This subalgebra is also called a
Cartan subalgebra.

Though our Eq. (19) has the satisfying feature that the known
NR wavefunctions solve it exactly, it does not ﬁt well the formal scat-
tering formalism which requires the wave functions to satisfy a true
eigenvalue equation. We propose to resolve this problem, by numer-
izing the “eigenvalue” operator to its stationary values.
In quantum
mechanics, one can obtain the energy eigenvalues of a quantum system
by the variational method. Actually all the eigenvalues are stationary
values of the operator, not necessarily the minimum value except for

9

the ground state. Here we do not need any variational method since
the wave functions are exactly known. In the following we show that
the stationary values of the operator
(Na) do give the correct energy
levels of the NR system. By setting

which is nothing but the energy level [2] for the interacting system of
the NR electron and the photon ﬁeld without including the rest mass
of the electron. The omission of the quadratic term in Eq. (32) is a
NR limit process. We also observe that by replacing Naω in Eq. (19′)
has the same value within the tolerance
either by κω or by (n+1/2)ω,
of the NR limit, showing the stationary nature of the value (32). With
the replacement of the “eigenvalue” operator by its stationary value
(32’) in the eigenvalue-like equation (19), we get an eﬀective eigenvalue
equation, which just recovers the ordinary Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equa-
tion (3) with the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian (4). It is this eﬀective
Schr¨odinger equation together with the NR wavefunctions (24) that
were used in the previous treatments [3-8]. So the physical predictions
obtained there remain valid.

E

In this way, we are led to the following procedure for treating an
NR electron in a photon ﬁeld, which could be generalized to the cases
of multimode and multipotentials:

(3) Replace the operator ”eigenvalue” by its stationary value to
obtain an eﬀective Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equation to be used in the
formal scattering formalism.

an NR electron in a two-mode photon ﬁeld for future studies as follows

To summarize, in this paper we have addressed carefully the prob-
lem of the equations of motion for a nonrelativistic electron interacting
with a single-mode photon ﬁeld, which is valid for arbitrary photon in-
tensity. We ﬁrst showed that the usual Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equation
is not solved by the NR limit of the wavefunctions that exactly solve
the corresponding Dirac equation. Then a Schr¨odinger-like equation is

11

derived from the Dirac equation without using the weak-ﬁeld assump-
tion. Though the “eigenvalue” is an operator in a Cartan subalgebra
involving the photon number operator, the new equation has a sim-
pler structure compared to the usual eigenvalue equation. An eﬀective
Schr¨odinger equation with ordinary eigenvalues, good in the NR limit,
is achieved by replacing the “eigenvalue” operator by a number, which
then can be used in the formal scattering theory. The Schr¨odinger-like
equation for the multi-mode case is also presented.

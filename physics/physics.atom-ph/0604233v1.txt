We present a theoretical analysis of the Stark eﬀect in the hyperﬁne structure of the cesium
ground-state. We have used third order perturbation theory, including diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal
hyperﬁne interactions, and have identiﬁed terms which were not considered in earlier treatments.
A numerical evaluation using perturbing levels up to n = 18 yields new values for the tensor
polarizability α2(6S1/2) and for the Stark shift of the clock transition frequency in cesium. The
polarizabilities are in good agreement with experimental values, thereby removing a 40-year-old
discrepancy. The clock shift value is in excellent agreement with a recent measurement, but in
contradiction with the commonly accepted value used to correct the black-body shift of primary
frequency standards.

Since its discovery, the Stark eﬀect has been an im-
portant spectroscopic tool for elucidating atomic struc-
ture. Kramers’ theorem shows that a static electric
ﬁeld cannot lift the Zeeman degeneracy of the nS1/2
ground state of alkali atoms. However, the joint ef-
fect of the hyperﬁne interaction and the Stark interac-
tion leads to both F and M dependent energy shifts.
In cesium, these shifts are suppressed by approximately
5 and 7 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to
the shift due to the second order scalar polarizability
α(2)
0 = 99.78(15) kHz/(kV/cm)2 [1]. So far there has
been no satisfactory theoretical description of the ex-
perimental measurements of these F and M dependent
Stark shifts. In this Letter, we extend previous theoreti-
cal models which allows us to bridge a long standing gap
between theory and experiment.

The eﬀect of a static electric ﬁeld on the hyperﬁne
structure was treated in a comprehensive paper by Angel
and Sandars [2], who showed that the second order Stark
eﬀect of a state |γi = |nLJ , F, M i can be parametrized
in terms of a scalar polarizability, α(2)
0 (γ), and a ten-
sor polarizability, α(2)
2 (γ), where the latter has non-zero
values for states with L ≥ 1 only. As a consequence,
the spherically symmetric nS1/2 alkali-atom ground state
has only a scalar polarizability, so that its magnetic sub-
levels |F, M i all experience the same Stark shift, inde-
pendent of F and M . However, an experiment by Haun
and Zacharias in 1957 [3] showed that a static electric
ﬁeld induces a quadratic (in ﬁeld strength E) shift of
the |F = 4, M = 0i ↔ |F = 3, M = 0i hyperﬁne (clock)
transition frequency (F -dependent eﬀect). In 1964, Lip-
worth and Sandars [4] demonstrated that a static elec-
tric ﬁeld also lifts the Zeeman degeneracy within the
F = 4 sublevel manifold of the cesium ground state (M -
dependent eﬀect). An improved measurement was per-

formed later by Carrico et al. [5] and its extension to ﬁve
stable alkali isotopes was done by Gould et al. [6].

Sandars [7] has shown that the F - and M -dependence
of the Stark eﬀect can be explained when the perturba-
tion theory is extended to third order after including the
hyperﬁne interaction. The theoretical expressions for the
tensor polarizabilties α2 of [7] were evaluated numerically
in [4] and [6] under simplifying assumptions discussed
below. The comparison with the experimental polariz-
abilities showed that the absolute theoretical values were
systematically larger for all ﬁve alkalis studied in [6]. Our
recent measurements [8, 9, 10] of α2 of 133Cs conﬁrmed
the earlier experimental values [5, 6].

To help clarify this long-standing discrepancy we have
reanalyzed the third-order theoretical treatment of the
Stark eﬀect in the alkali hyperﬁne structure. We have
identiﬁed contributions which were not included in earlier
calculations and as a result we obtain theoretical values
which are in good agreement with experimental results [5,
6, 8, 9, 10]. When applied to the Stark shift of the clock
transition frequency our theoretical results yield a value
which is in good agreement with a recent experimental
measurement [11]. This result has direct consequences for
the correction of the blackbody shift of primary frequency
standards.

The third order perturbation of the energy Eα of the

sublevel |αi = |6S1/2, F, M i is given by

∆E(3)(α) =

Xβ6=α,γ6=α

hα| W |βi hβ| W |γi hγ| W |αi
(Eα − Eβ)(Eα − Eγ)

where Eβ and Eγ are the energies of unperturbed states,
and where the perturbation W = Hhf + HSt describes
the hyperﬁne and Stark interactions. Of all the terms
obtained by substituting W into Eq. (1) only those con-
taining the product of two matrix elements of HSt and one
matrix element of Hhf give nonzero contributions because

of the selection rules ∆L = ±1 for HSt and ∆L = 0 for
Hhf. The three W ’s that appear are thus to be replaced
by permutations of {HSt, HSt, Hhf}.

We address ﬁrst the second term of Eq. (1). The diag-
onal matrix element in front of the sum represents only
the hyperﬁne interaction in the ground state, i.e., the
Fermi contact interaction, while the sum is carried out
over Stark interactions only. Diagram A of Fig. 1 repre-
sents this term in graphical form. The hyperﬁne matrix
element hα| Hhf |αi is scalar, but F dependent, and the
sum is similar to the expression for the second order po-
larizability, except for the squared energy denominator.
As in the theory of the second order polarizability [2] the
sum can therefore be expressed as hα| H(k=0)
|αi.
The scalar contribution, hα| H(0)
eff |αi, depends only on the
strength of the applied electric ﬁeld, E2, while the second
rank tensor contribution H(2)
eff depends on its orientation
z − E2. The selection rules for tensor operators re-

quire that hS1/2 k H(2)
eff k S1/2i = 0. As a consequence the
second term of Eq. (1) gives a scalar contribution to the
energy which depends on F , but not on M , and which
can be parametrized by a third order scalar polarizability

This term produces the major contribution to the Stark
shift of the hyperﬁne transition frequency ∆ ν00 = ν(F =
4, M = 0) − ν(F = 3, M = 0).

We next address the ﬁrst term of Eq. (1) and consider
only diagonal matrix elements of Hhf. As before, the
Stark interaction part of the ﬁrst term has only a rank
k = 0 (scalar) contribution. The dipole-dipole and elec-
tric quadrupole parts of the hyperﬁne interaction have
the rotational symmetry of k = 0, 2 and k = 2 tensors,
respectively. Together with the scalar Stark interaction,
the ﬁrst term thus has scalar and tensor parts. The scalar
part has the same F dependence [10] as α(3)
0 (F ), and cor-
rects the latter by approximately 1%, while the second
rank tensor parts have an F and M dependence, which

where the dependence on the angle θ between the elec-

for lifting the Zeeman degeneracy in the ground state hy-
perﬁne levels, but gives also a correction to the shift of
the clock transition frequency which itself is dominated
by Eq. (2). The third order Stark eﬀect of the two hy-
perﬁne levels can then be parametrized in terms of the

where a1 is the contribution of the tensor part of the
dipole-dipole hyperﬁne interaction, and a2 the contribu-
tion of the electric quadrupole interaction. The Fermi-
contact interaction provides the dominant contribution
to a0, although it also has a small contribution from the
scalar part of the dipole-dipole interaction. Equations (5)
bear a close resemblance to the expressions obtained by
Sandars [7], except for the negative sign of the a1 term
in Eq. (5b), which is positive in Sandars work. We have
conﬁrmed the sign of our expression in a recent experi-
ment in which we have compared the Stark splittings of
the F = 3 and F = 4 sublevels of cesium [9]. That sign
error, which seems to have remained unnoticed for almost
40 years, has no consequence for the tensor polarizability
of the F = 4 state, which is the only one measured to
date. It aﬀects the Stark shift of the clock transition at
a level slightly below today’s experimental sensitivity.

Sandars’ equations were evaluated by [4] and [6] who
considered only diagonal matrix elements of Hhf for the
6S1/2 and the 6PJ states (Fig. 1). They further neglected
the ﬁne structure energy splitting in the denominators
of Eq. (1) and assumed the relation A6P1/2 = 5A6P3/2
for the hyperﬁne constants, valid for one-electron atoms,
while for Cs the corresponding ratio of experimental val-
ues is 5.8. Those assumptions yielded the value (f) in
Fig. 3, which is in disagreement with the experimental
results. We have reevaluated [10] their result by drop-
ping the simplifying assumptions mentioned above and
by using recent experimental values of the reduced matrix
elements of the electric dipole operator h6S1/2 k d k 6Pji

from [12]. As a result, the discrepancy becomes even
larger [point (f’) in Fig. 3], and does not change signif-
icantly when the perturbation sum is extended to nPJ
states with n > 6.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) is not restricted to diagonal
matrix elements of the hyperﬁne interaction. We have
therefore extended the numerical evaluation of Eq. (1) by
including oﬀ-diagonal terms. Figure 2 gives a schematic
overview of all possible conﬁgurations which include oﬀ-
diagonal hyperﬁne matrix elements and which are com-
patible with the hyperﬁne and Stark operator selection
rules. It is interesting to note that the diagrams 1 and
2 were already considered by Feichtner et al. [15] in
their calculation of the clock transition Stark shift. For
unknown reasons, the oﬀ-diagonal terms were never in-
cluded in the calculation of the tensor polarizability.

We have evaluated all the diagrams shown in Fig. 2,
and in particular the diagrams 3, 4, and 5, which, to
our knowledge, were never considered before. As noted
in the ﬁgure, all diagrams lead to F and M dependent
energy shifts, except for diagram 1, which gives an M in-
dependent shift. Thus all diagrams contribute, together
with the diagonal contributions A and B of Fig. 1, to
the Stark shift of the clock transition, while only the dia-
grams B and 2–5 contribute to the tensor polarizability.
Moreover, the relative importance with which the dia-
grams contribute to the two eﬀects of interest is quite
diﬀerent. In the case of the clock shift, we ﬁnd that 90%
(95%) of the total contribution (n=6–18) comes from the
diagrams A and 1 evaluated for n = 6, 7 (n = 6, 7, 8). In
this case the contributing (electric dipole and hyperﬁne)
matrix elements are directly or indirectly given by exper-
imentally measured quantities. The diagonal hyperﬁne
matrix elements are proportional to the measured hyper-

ﬁne splittings, while the oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne matrix el-
ements between S states of diﬀerent principal quantum
numbers n can be expressed in terms of the geometrical
averages of the hyperﬁne splittings of the coupled states.
Dzuba et al. have shown [18] that this relation holds at
a level of 10−3. This gives us a high level of conﬁdence
in our value of the clock shift rate. The oﬀ-diagonal ma-
trix elements of the diagrams 2–5 cannot be traced back
to experimental quantities. We have calculated these
matrix elements using wave functions obtained from the
Schr¨odinger equation for a Thomas-Fermi potential, with
corrections including dipolar and quadrupolar core polar-
ization as well as spin-orbit interaction with a relativistic
correction factor following [19]. We included nSJ , nPJ ,
and nDJ states up to n = 18 in the perturbation sum.
As a result we obtain

∆ν00/E2 = −2.06(1) Hz/(kV/cm)2 ,

(6)

for the shift of the clock transition frequency, and

α(3)
2 (F = I ± J) = ∓3.72(25) × 10−2 Hz/(kV/cm)2 , (7)

for the tensor polarizability. The results are shown as
dotted lines in Figs. 3 and 4 together with previous the-
oretical and experimental results. The uncertainty of
our calculated values is indicated by the shaded bands.
The relative uncertainty of the clock shift is signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of the tensor polarizability due to the
use of experimental values, with relatively small uncer-
tainties. For the contributions which we calculated ex-
plicitly from the Schr¨odinger wave functions we use the
accuracy (4%–8%) with which these wave functions re-
produce experimental dipole matrix elements and hyper-
ﬁne splittings to estimate the precision of our results.
More details will be given in a forthcoming publica-

4

tion [9]. We can claim that the present calculation of
α(3)
2 yields a good agreement with all experimental data.
The situation with the Stark shift of the clock tran-
sition frequency is less clear. While the experimental
results [3], [13], and [14] [(a), (c), and (e) in Fig. 4] are
supported by the theoretical value of [16](d), our present
result is in excellent agreement with the recent experi-
mental value of Godone et al. [11](g) and with the calcu-
lation of Micalizio et al. [17](f). The shift was also calcu-
lated by Feichtner et al. [15] in an approximation using
hydrogenic wave functions, neglecting spin-orbit interac-
tions, and considering only the diagrams A, B, 1, and 2
[point (b) in Fig. 4]. With the approximations of [15], the
scalar polarizability α0 can be factored out of their ﬁnal
result. Using a recent precision measurement of α0 [1]
we have rescaled [point (b’) in Fig. 4] the value of [15],
which then becomes consistent with the present result.

We conclude by recalling the relevance of the latter re-
sult for primary frequency standards. One of the leading
systematic shifts of the cesium clock frequency is due to
the interaction of the atoms with the blackbody radia-
tion (BBR) ﬁeld.
It was shown [20] that the dynamic
BBR shift can be parametrized in terms of the static
Stark shift investigated here. The correction factor for
the BBR shift commonly used is based on the precise ex-
perimental value of Simon et al. [14] [point (e) in Fig. 4],
whose diﬀerence with the present result is 21 (53) times
the corresponding theoretical (experimental) uncertainty.
In order to shine more light on this important issue we are
preparing an alternative new experiment for measuring
the static Stark shift of the clock transition frequency.

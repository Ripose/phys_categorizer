We consider the hyperﬁne structure, the atomic spectrum and the decay channels of the bound
µ+µ− system (dimuonium). The annihilation lifetimes of low-lying atomic states of the system
lie in the 10−12 s range. The decay rates could be measured by detection of the decay products
(high energy photons or electron-positron pairs). The hyperﬁne structure splitting of the dimuonic
system and its decay rate are inﬂuenced by electronic vacuum polarization eﬀects in the far time-
like asymptotic region. This constitutes a previously unexplored kinematic regime. We evaluate
next–to–leading order radiative corrections to the decay rate of low-lying atomic states. We also
obtain order α5 mµ corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting of the 1S and 2S levels.

I. INTRODUCTION

dimuonium + n) and by photons on nuclei (γ + Z

The bound system consisting of two muons (dimuonium) can be produced in heavy nuclei inelastic scattering at
high energies and in particle decays. The decay of the neutral η0 meson into dimuonium has been investigated
dimuonium + γ). The formation of dimuonium in pion–proton collisions
theoretically by L. Nemenov [1] (η0
dimuonium + Z) has been discussed in [2]. For the
(π− + p
direct production of dimuonium in muon–antimuon collisions, considerable experimental diﬃculties associated with
slow muon beams would have to be overcome. Another possible pathway for the production of the system, which
we do not discuss in any further detail here, is the e+e−-annihilation (near or above the µ threshold). Dimuonium,
once produced, undergoes atomic decay (into energetically lower atomic states) and annihilation decay (into electrons
and photons). Because the annihilation products are hard photons and relativistic electron–positron pairs, the decays
could be investigated experimentally by established methods of particle physics.

In this work, we devote special attention to the annihilation decay rates of low-lying atomic states. The decay rate
of the S = 1 ortho states of dimuonium has been evaluated by J. Malenfant in pioneering investigations [3,4]. The
name “dimuonium” has been proposed in [4]. This work can therefore be regarded as a continuation of the earlier
investigations on the system. We try to reﬁne the analysis of the ortho–states, and we investigate in addition the
S = 0 para states. We obtain corrections to the decay rate in next–to–leading order.

In this work, we also investigate the hyperﬁne structure in next–to–leading order. We further discuss brieﬂy the
atomic spectrum of dimuonium. The contribution of electronic vacuum polarization to the hyperﬁne structure and
to the decay rate of ortho states lies in the far time-like asymptotic region. Its observation would constitute a test
of QED in this previously unexplored kinematic regime. Due to the small length scale of the system, the hyperﬁne
structure of the dimuonic atom is inﬂuenced by the eﬀect of hadronic vacuum polarization (at the level of one part in
103). The contribution of hadronic vacuum polarization could therefore be extracted from precise measurements of
the hyperﬁne splitting and the orthodimounium decay rate.

Among the exotic atomic systems, some attention has recently been devoted to pionium (π+π−-system). The
spectrum and decay channels of pionium have been discussed extensively (see e. g. [5–7]). The production of pionium
has been observed recently [8]. The formation of bound atomic systems in particle decays has been observed earlier.

This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst study the spectrum of the system including radiative corrections (Lamb
shift, Section II). We then proceed to an investigation of the hyperﬁne structure in Section III. As the highest
accuracy can presumably be obtained in decay rate measurements, we devote special attention to the decay channels
which are investigated in detail in Sections IV and V.

II. THE ATOMIC SPECTRUM OF DIMUONIUM

The dimuonic atom is an analogue of the hydrogen, muonic hydrogen and positronium atoms. The main feature of
muonic hydrogen (µH) which diﬀers from properties of hydrogen is the order of magnitude of the Lamb shift relative
to the ﬁne structure splitting (see e. g. [11]). The fs splitting in µH and H (also in positronium and dimuonium)
is of the order of α4 mr, where mr denotes the reduced mass of the system, which is roughly equal to the mass of
the lighter particle in a system with a heavy nucleus. In hydrogen the Lamb shift of the order of α5 mr, whereas in
muonic systems, the Lamb shift is of the order of α3 mr, because of the large eﬀect of vacuum polarization. The above
considerations are parametrically true for all states, but numerical coeﬃcients turn out to be largest for S states.
Because the coeﬃcients to the Lamb shift are negative (attractive Uehling potential), S states are signiﬁcantly lowered
in energy in muonic systems. In Fig. 1 we present an overview over the spectrum of hydrogen, µH, positronium and
µ+µ−.

In both hydrogen and µH, the hyperﬁne structure is a smaller eﬀect of order α4 (m2

r/M ) (M denotes the mass
of the nucleus). This is diﬀerent in positronium. Positronium has a more complicated spectrum than the hydrogen
atom. Due to the larger magnetic moment of the “central” particle (and its smaller mass), and due to virtual pair
annihilation processes, the eﬀects which are responsible for the ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure and for the Lamb shift
have the same order of magnitude: α4 mr. For positronium as well as for hydrogen, the ﬁne structure is deﬁned as
the separation of levels with the same principal and angular orbital momentum quantum numbers.

In positronium, diﬀerent quantum numbers have to be used for the classiﬁcation of levels than in an atom with
a heavy nucleus. For a system with a heavy nucleus, the total electron moment j = l + s is conserved within the
central ﬁeld approximation. States are classiﬁed as nljF . In positronium the total spin S = s1 + s2 is an exactly
conserved quantity. States are classifyed as nlSF (denoted as n2 S+1lF ), where S = 1 for an ortho and S = 0 for para
states. In all systems considered we denote the total angular atomic moment by F . Although the atomic spectrum
of dimuonium is determined by a large Lamb shift of order α3 mr (as is the case for µH), the classiﬁcation of levels
is like in positronium (quantum numbers nlSF ).

There exists no close analogy of dimuonium with pionium, because pionium containes only spinless particles, and
the spectrum includes neither a ﬁne nor a hyperﬁne structure. Due to the strong interaction, the hadronic pionium
system lives only a very short time, and the atomic structure cannot be investigated (because the decay rate exceeds
n′S (n′ < n)
the rate of atomic transitions). By contrast, for P -states in dimuonium, the atomic transition nP
dominates over the annihilation decay rate. The lifetime of the atomic levels is considered in section III.

→

The main contribution to the Lamb shift in dimuonium is caused by the one–loop electronic vacuum polarization.
Due to the small spatial separation of the two muons in the µ+µ− system, the charge of the two particles, which is
larger than the eﬀective charge to be observed at larger distance, is less screened and causes a deviation of the energy
levels of the order α3 mr. For hydrogen, the vacuum polarization enters at the order of α5 mr, but for dimuonium,
two powers of α are compensated for by the muon-electron mass ratio (or, by employing a coordinate space picture,
by the smaller separation of the particles).

We now turn to a brief discussion of the atomic levels of dimuonium. The eﬀect of electronic vacuum polarization on
the spectrum is investigated. Any vacuum polarization insertion in the photon line can be represented as a substitution

In contrast to muonic hydrogen (µH), dimuonium is a purely leptonic system. Therefore its spectrum is not inﬂuenced
by nuclear structure eﬀects.

III. HYPERFINE STRUCTURE OF DIMUONIUM

The ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure in dimuonium and positronium in lowest order α4 m are given by the following

The hyperﬁne structure interval E(0)
hfs (nS) arises from the exchange and annihilation diagrams (see Fig. 3), which
contribute 4/7 EF and 3/7 EF to the Fermi energy EF , respectively. The triplet n3S1 states are energetically higher
than the singlet n1S0 states. For P states, the α4 corrections imply the following order of the spectrum, in decreasing
energy: n3P2, n1P1, n3P1, n3P0 (we follow here the usual spectroscopic notation n2S+1lF ).

We now turn to the evaluation of radiative corrections to the hyperﬁne structure splitting for S states of order
α/π EF (corresponding to α/π E(0)
hfs ). Some contributions are the same for positronium and dimuonium, some are
speciﬁc to the dimuonic system. The contributions which are alike for both systems are depicted in Fig. 4. These con-
tributions originate from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in the transverse photon diagram (denoted
as “(g-2)-T”), from recoil corrections (denoted by “Rec”), from the vertex correction to the annihilation diagram
(denoted by “Vert-A”), from the muonic vacuum polarization (“VP-µ-A”), and from box-diagrams corresponding to
two-photon annihilation (denoted by “2A”). In this paper, due to the multitude of corrections considered, we prefer
to denote the contributions by short abbreviations, which we hope are self–explanatory, rather then single letters,
in order to enhance the clarity of presentation. The results for the above corrections are listed in Table II (ﬁrst 5
contributions, above the separating line). The sum of corrections to the Fermi energy of order α/π EF amounts to
[12,20]

where the imaginary part is entirely due to paradimuonium. It corresponds to the two-photon decay of the para
system [18,21]

Now we turn to the evaluation of corrections speciﬁc to dimuonium (the relevant diagrams are depicted in Fig. 5).
We ﬁrst evaluate the correction due to vacuum polarization insertions in the Coulomb photon line. For the dimuonic
atom, the correction to the wave function due to electronic vacuum polarization has relative order α/π and therefore
modiﬁes the hyperﬁne splitting in α/π relative order. The order of magnitude of this correction is speciﬁc to the
dimuonic atom (small length scale of the system, see Section I. For “VPC-T” (see Fig. 5), the contribution is given

is the reduced Coulomb Green function (the pole of the reference state is excluded from the sum over all intermediate
states). Because atomic momenta are of the order of α mµ in the system under consideration, it is suﬃcient to carry
out the calculations with non–relativistic wave functions. The reduced Green function is a function of two coordinates
r1 and r2. Due to the appearance of the δ-like potential the Green function is needed only for r1 = 0. It can be
expressed in closed form [24],

The analytical calculations were partially performed with the computer algebra system Mathematica [22]. The
contribution due to the VPC-A diagram can be evaluated by considering the relative contribution of these diagrams to
ﬁrst order hfs (4/7 and 3/7, respectively). An independent evaluation is done by utilization of a spectral decomposition
of the reduced Coulomb Green function. If that representation of the Green function is chosen, then the calculation
is closely related to [23]. In order to simplify the calculation, we observe that the perturbation can be expressed as
a modiﬁcation of the wave function at r = 0. The discrete and continuous spectra give distinct contributions. The
results of the respective terms (discrete and continuous spectrum) for the 1S and 2S states are

The hadronic contribution (denoted by VP-h-A) to the vacuum polarization is found as the sum of four terms. The
main contribution results from a pionic loop. We follow here the approach in [25]. The spectral function is of the

This result agrees with the full pion form factor of (29) to about 10 %, so it is justiﬁed to consider mesonic resonances

Results for the Lamb shift and the hyperﬁne structure of low-lying levels are presented in Tables I and II. The
largest deviation from the scaling appeared in VPC-T and VPC-A contributions (16%), because the wave function
(see Eqs. (21) and (22)) is more sensitive to the behaviour of the potential about the origin.

An important point for a possible investigation of the spectrum is the lifetime of levels. As one can see from Eqs.
(13) and (27) the annihilation lifetimes of S-levels are much shorter that the lifetime of the free muon, τµ = 2.20 10−6 s.
By contrast, the annihilation decay rate for P -states includes an extra α2, and the lifetime is of the same order of
magnitude as that of the free muon.

The decay rates of excited states have to be compared with the atomic transition rates, which are also of the order

of α5 mµ (see e. g. [16]). We obtain

τ (2P

1S) = 1.54

10−11 s .

→

·

Annihilation of P states is suppressed by two orders of α compared to S states due to the behaviour of the P wave
function near the origin. Therefore, the annihilation lifetime of the 2P state can be estimated to be of the order of
10−7 s, and it is seen that the atomic transition, not the annihilation, determines the lifetime of the excited 2P state
in dimuonium.

This situation is diﬀerent for S states, where the annihilation dominates over atomic transitions. The annihilation
10−12 s, and we expect that the decay rates could be
lifetimes of of 1S and 2S states lie between 0.6
measured via detection of the decay products. Radiative corrections to the decay rates are considered in the following

IV. DECAY CHANNELS OF ORTHODIMUONIUM

The leading–order contributions to the orthodimuonium and paradimuonium decay rate can be extracted as the

imaginary parts of the energy corrections to the hyperﬁne structure,

The calculations at leading order were presented above (Eqs. (13, 27)). The above results can also be found in [3,4].
We begin the consideration of radiative corrections with orthodimuonium, and provide results for the 1S state here.
Results for the 2S state (and 1S) are summarized in Table III. The diagrams contributing in next–to–leading order
for ortho states are depicted in Fig. 7.

The VPC-A correction can be interpreted as a modiﬁcation of the wave function at the origin. The energy shift and

of the wave function. We obtain

The diagrams VP-µ-A, VP-e-A and VP-h-A have to be interpreted as modiﬁcations of the photon propagator.
Because the energy shift is proportional to the amplitude of the propagator, but the decay rate is proportional to its
square, we have to multiply the relative correction to hfs by a factor of 2 in order to obtain the relative correction to
the decay rate. Hence, the VP-µ-A, VP-e-A and VP-h-A diagrams yield a total correction of

We now consider the one-loop radiative corrections to the electron line (ReA) and emission of a photon by an
electron, i. e. bremsstrahlung (BeA). The sum of BeA+ReA can be easily obtained from the diagrams in Fig. 8

The ﬁrst term corresponds to the sum of the analytically evaluated contributions Vert-A, VP-µ-A, VP-e-A and

butions VPC-A and VP-h-A. The last term is associated to the three photon decay. The result in Eq. (50) has
to be compared with the earlier analysis of the decay rate of heavy leptonium [4]. The ﬁnal result for the ana-
lytically evaluated contributions, which is identical to the ﬁrst term in Eq.
(50), whose analytical expression is
(4/3) ln(2 mµ/me)
221/36, is found in agreement with the pioneering investigations by J. Malenfant [4]. For the
VPC-A correction, Malenfants results are in slight numerical disagreement with ours (see Eqs. (77,78) in [4]). We
presume this disagreement can be traced to the fact that Malenfant has calculated the VPC-A correction with free
Green functions, whereas the evaluation in this work is done using bound Green functions.
In this context it is
0, our result is agreement with that of Malenfant. This can be
important to note that in the limit of α mµ/2me →

which is in agreement with Eq. (80) of [4]. We can therefore conclude that in the limit of weak binding (κ
Malenfants result is in agreement with ours. However, we hold the view that bound Green functions should rather be
used for the VPC-A correction. The atomic momentum in dimuonium is of the order of α mµ/2 = κ me (κ
0.75).
This momentum is close to the mass of the loop particles (electrons and positrons) of electronic vacuum polarization.
These particles determine the radius of the Uehling potential. Therefore, some of the momentum integration for
the VPC-A correction is performed in an area about me, where the bound Coulomb Green function cannot be
approximated by the free Green function (because the eﬀect of the binding Coulomb potential, in momentum space,
is inversely proportional to the square of the momentum transfer). This consideration should explain the slight
numerical disagreement for the VPC-A correction between this work and the result in [4].

V. DECAY CHANNELS OF PARADIMUONIUM

The diagrams contributing to paradimuonium decay in next–to–leading order α6 m are presented in Fig 9, results
are summarized in Table IV. The vertex correction term (Vert-2A) is equivalent to the corresponding correction for
parapositronium [30],

Γ(0)(n1S0) .

The correction to the wave function caused by the VPC-A diagram modiﬁes the decay rate of the para system in the
same way as the ortho system (see Table IV), and introduces a deviation from the 1/n3 scaling.

For the para state, there exists another correction to the decay rate corresponding to the decay into a photon
and an electron-positron pair. The result for the A2e correction can be obtained in the following way. We consider
the one–loop vacuum polarization insertion into a 2-photon annihilation diagram (Fig. 10). Because the vacuum
polarization insertion, evaluated for a real photon, must be equal to zero (gauge invariance of vacuum polarization),
the imaginary part of the diagrams in Fig. 10 leads to the result we need. We can use Eq. (4) for the parametric
form of the vacuum polarization insertion, and we consider the s-integration as the ﬁnal one. The integrand is now
equivalent to the imaginary part of the 2A diagram for the hfs, but with one of the photons having a ﬁnite mass s
(s corresponds to the sum of the four–momenta of the emerging electron–positron pair). The vacuum polarization
insertion normally ﬁxes a gauge (the Landau gauge) for the virtual photon, because the polarization insertion is
proportional to the transverse projector. However, as it was demonstrated in [31], it is possible to substitute in Eq.
(4) any covariant gauge. For convenience, we choose the Feynman gauge. As a result we have the expression

∆ΓA2e(n1S0) =

ds ρ(s) Γ(0)(s, 0) ,

α
π

Z

where Γ(0)(s, 0) is the decay rate to one real photon and a virtual photon with mass s.
In order to obtain the
correction in relative units, we divide by the ﬁrst–order result, which is given by Γ(0)(0, 0). The correction relative to
the ﬁrst–order result Γ(0)(n1S0) is given by

An additional factor 2 appears because the insertion of a vacuum polarization operator doubles the number of non-
equivalent diagrams contributing to the imaginary part. For the logarithmic coeﬃcient we may neglect s in Γ(0)(s, 0)
and approximate Γ(0)(s, 0)

Γ(0)(0, 0), and use the asymptotic form of the spectral function (cf. Eq (2)),

An independent evaluation of the A2e-correction using the standard S-matrix formalism is used to verify the result in
Eq. (57). Treatment of the Dirac currents involved in simpliﬁed by application of a symbolic program [32] developed
for high energy physics calculations by A. Hsieh and E. Yehudai. Some care must be taken during evaluation, because
one cannot assume the electrons as massless in the ﬁnal states (the result else includes a logarithmic divergence in
the electron mass). Proper regularization of the relevant expression then leads to the result in Eq. (57).

The ﬁnal result for the next–to–leading order radiative corrections to paradimuonium decay (see Table IV) is

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We evaluate next–to–leading order corrections to the spectrum, to the hyperﬁne splitting and to the decay rate of
low-lying levels of the dimuonic system. The results for the spectrum are given in Section II. We observe that
for 2P states, the atomic decay into the 1S state dominates over annihilation processes. This would facilitate
experimental observation of the atomic transition, if dimuonium atoms can be produced in quantities suﬃcient to
carry out spectroscopic measurements. We evaluate the hyperﬁne splitting of 1S and 2S states in next–to–leading
order. The results are

Ehfs(1S) =

We estimate higher order QED corrections to enter at the 1% level of the next–to leading order corrections considered
in this work.

Lifetimes in the 10−12 s range can be measured by established methods of particle physics via detection of the decay
products (electron-positron pairs in case of orthodimuonium and two photons in the case of paradimuonium). We
stress that accurate decay rate measurements can be accomplished with fewer individual atoms than would be needed
for spectroscopic investigations.

One of the ways to investigate the hyperﬁne structure of 1S or 2S states could be based on the observation
of the interference between paradimuonium and orthodimuonium in an infrared frequency ﬁeld at resonance (the
radiofrequency ﬁeld would mix the two states and thus yield a modiﬁed decay rate of the statistical sample). We
conclude that the dimuonic system oﬀers the possibility to observe quantum electrodynamic eﬀects in a previously
unexplored kinematic region.

FIG. 1. Overview over the spectrum of n = 2 levels in hydrogen, muonic hydrogen (µH), positronium and dimuonium
(µ+µ−). The double lines denote the hyperﬁne structure splitting of the levels in hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. Dashed lines
denote S = 0-states, full lines denote S = 1-states.

FIG. 2.

(Electronic) vacuum polarization insertion in the Coulomb photon (main contribution to the Lamb shift in muonic
systems). The dashed line denotes a Coulomb photon. Bold fermionic lines denote muons, thin lines denote electrons and
positrons.

FIG. 4. Known corrections up to the order α/π EF to the hyperﬁne splitting of dileptonic systems (positronium, dimuonium).
Diagrams are explained in the text. For the dimuonic atom, the corrections depicted here contribute to hfs, but there are
additional terms speciﬁc to the dimuonic system which need to be taken into account. The subtraction of lower order (L.O.)
contributions is necessary for some of the diagrams in order to prevent double counting. The bold fermionic lines denote muons.
The direction of time in all diagrams is from left to right.

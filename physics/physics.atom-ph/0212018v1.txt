We consider corrections to the Lamb shift of p-wave atomic states due to the ﬁnite nuclear size
(FNS). In other words, these are radiative corrections to the atomic isotop shift related to FNS. It is
shown that the structure of the corrections is qualitatively diﬀerent from that for s-wave states. The
perturbation theory expansion for the relative correction for a p1/2-state starts from α ln(1/Zα)-
term, while for s1/2-states it starts from Zα2 term. Here α is the ﬁne structure constant and Z
is the nuclear charge.
In the present work we calculate the α-terms for 2p-states, the result for
2p1/2-state reads (8α/9π)[ln(1/(Zα)2) + 0.710]. Even more interesting are p3/2-states. In this case
the “correction” is by several orders of magnitude larger than the “leading” FNS shift.

Experimental and theoretical investigation of the ra-
diative shift (Lamb shift) of energy levels in heavy atoms
is an important way to test Quantum Electrodynamics
in presence of a strong external electric ﬁeld. One of
the eﬀects related to this problem is a dependence of the
Lamb shift on the ﬁnite nuclear size (FNS). One can also
look at this eﬀect from another point of view. It is well
known that there is an isotop shift of atomic levels due
to the FNS. The corrections we are talking about are the
radiative corrections to the isotop shift.

The corrections for 1s-, 2s-, and 2p-states have been
calculated numerically, exactly in Zα, in Refs.[1, 2, 3].
The self-energy and the vertex corrections to the FNS
eﬀect for any s-wave state have been calculated analyti-
cally in order α(Zα) in Refs.[4, 5]. However, the struc-
ture of the higher order Zα corrections and, in partic-
ular, their logarithmic dependence on the nuclear size
has not been understood even for s-states. Our interest
to FNS radiative corrections has been stimulated by our
work on the radiative corrections to atomic parity non-
concervation [6]. Technically the parity nonconservation
eﬀect has some common features with that of the FNS
radiative correction:
in both cases the eﬀective size of
the perturbation source is much smaller than the Comp-
ton wavelength λC . In the paper [6] we have elucidated
the structure of higher order in Zα FNS radiative cor-
rections for s-electrons, and have calculated analytically
α(Zα) and α(Zα)2 ln(λC /r0) self-energy and vertex FNS
relative radiative corrections. Here r0 is the nuclear ra-
dius.
In the present work we calculate FNS radiative
corrections for p-wave electrons. We demonstrate that
the structure of the corrections for p-wave states is very
much diﬀerent from that for the s-wave states. Physically
it happens because of diﬀerent infrared behavior.

Due to the ﬁnite nuclear size, the electric potential
V (r) of the nucleus is diﬀerent from that for a pointlike
nucleus. The deviation is

δV (r) = V (r)

FIG. 1: The leading contribution to the FNS eﬀect is given by

are given by diagrams (b-e). The double line denotes the exact
electron Green’s function in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus,
the cross denotes the nucleus, the zigzag line denotes the FNS
perturbation (1), and the dashed line denotes the photon.

Diagrams Fig.1(b) and Fig.1(c) correspond to the con-
tributions of the electron self-energy operator and the
vertex operator, respectively. The diagram Fig.1(d) de-
scribes a modiﬁcation of δV (see eq. (1)) due to the vac-
uum polarization, and the diagram Fig.1(e) corresponds

to a modiﬁcation of the electron wave function due to the
polarization of the vacuum by the Coulomb ﬁeld (Uehling
potential).

Technically the most complicated are the self-energy
and the vertex FNS (SEVFNS) corrections given by di-
agrams in Fig.1(b) and Fig.1(c). According to our pre-
vious work [6], the SEVFNS relative correction for an
s-wave state is of the form

is no contribution of larger distances into ∆s? The rea-
son is very simple. In the leading order the correction ∆s
can be expressed in terms of the forward electron-nucleus
scattering amplitude [6]. There is a rigorous QED theo-
rem that claims that there is no an infrared divergence
in the forward scattering amplitude, see e.g. Ref.
[8].

Therefore, quantum ﬂuctuations from distances r
cannot contribute to ∆s (see also Ref.[9]). Let us look
now at the p-wave SEVFNS correction ∆p. From the
point of view of the scattering problem it corresponds
to scattering at ﬁnite angle. The ﬁnite-angle scattering
amplitude is always infrared divergent. Therefore, one
must expect a contribution to ∆p from quantum ﬂuctu-
ations at distances r
λC . This is the contribution we
calculate in the present work.

(3) is much larger than the lower one. Hence, the upper
component determines the FNS shift of such a state. On
the other hand, for p1/2-state the lower component and
hence its contribution to the FNS shift is dominating. A
straightforward calculation gives the following values for
the FNS shifts of 2s and 2p states (diagram Fig.1(a))

Let us calculate now the leading in Zα one loop
SEVFNS radiative correction E(1) for p1/2- and p3/2-
states. This correction is given by diagrams in Fig.1(b)
and Fig.1(c). Since we consider the leading correction, it
is suﬃcient to use the nonrelativistic approximation for
electron wave functions (two-component wave functions).
It is suﬃcient also to use the eﬀective FNS perturbation
that reproduces FNS correction for s-wave states,

there is no real singularity at ω = 0. There is a real

The correction ∆p given by Eq. (21) is plotted in Fig.2
by the solid line. The results of computations [2] are
shown by diamonds. Agreement is very good.

Concluding, we have shown that corrections to the
Lamb shift of p-wave atomic states due to the ﬁnite nu-
clear size are qualitatively diﬀerent from that for s-wave
states. The diﬀerence is related to the infrared behavior
of quantum ﬂuctuations. As a result, the leading relative
p-wave correction is proportional to α ln(1/Zα) while the
leading s-wave correction is proportional to α(Zα). The
leading p-wave correction has been calculated analyti-
cally.

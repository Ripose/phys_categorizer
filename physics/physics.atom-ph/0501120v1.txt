Abstract

A recently formulated version of the eigenchannel method [R. Szmytkowski, Ann.
Phys. (N.Y.) 311, 503 (2004)] is applied to quantum scattering of Schr¨odinger particles
from non-local separable potentials. Eigenchannel vectors and negative cotangents of
eigenphase-shifts are introduced as eigensolutions to some weighted matrix spectral
problem, without a necessity of prior construction and diagonalization of the scattering
matrix. Explicit expressions for the scattering amplitude, the total cross section in
terms of the eigenchannel vectors and the eigenphase-shifts are derived. An illustrative
example is provided.

Introduction

Recently, Szmytkowski [1] (see also [2]), inspired by works of Garbacz [3] and Har-
rington and Mautz [4] has presented a general formulation of the eigenchannel method
for quantum scattering from Hermitian short-range potentials. This formulation, ex-
ploiting the formalism of integral equations, is alternative to that proposed in 1960’s
by Danos and Greiner [5], who based on wave equations written in diﬀerential forms.
While various theoretical aspects of the new approach to the eigenchannel method
have been considered in detail in Ref.
[1], no explicit illustrative applications of the
formalism have been provided therein. It is the purpose of the present paper to ﬁll
in this gap by applying the formalism to non-relativistic scattering from non-local
separable potentials.

Separable potentials have proved to be useful in many branches of physics such
as atomic [6], molecular [7] and solid state [8] physics. Still, the most extensive
use of the separable potentials seems to be made in nuclear physics for describing
nucleon-nucleon interactions [9]. The utility of separable potentials stems from two
facts. Firstly, the Lippman-Schwinger [10] equation with a separable potential may
be solved by employing algebraic methods. Secondly, methods are known which allow
one to construct separable approximations to arbitrary local potentials [11]. Here, the
crucial role plays method proposed by Ernst, Shakin and Thaler [12] (see also [13]).

The arrangement of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains some basic notions
of quantum theory of potential scattering. In Section 3 we focus on scattering from
separable potentials. In Section 4 we deﬁne eigenchannel vectors as eigenvectors of
some weighted spectral problem and investigate some of their properties. We introduce
also eigenphaseshifts using eigenvalues of the same spectral problem. Then, we derive

formulas for a scattering amplitude in terms of eigenchannel vectors and calculate a
total cross section and an averaged total cross section. Finally, in Section 5 we consider
an illustrative example. The paper ends with two appendices.

Consider a Schr¨odinger particle described by the monochromatic plane wave

with ~ki denoting its initial momentum, scattered elastically, i.e.

kernel V (r, r′).

It was shown by Lippmann and Schwinger [10] that such processes can be described

by the following integral equation:

As usual, during considerations concerning scattering processes we tend to ﬁnd asymp-

3 The special class of non-local separable potentials

In this section we focus on the special class of Hermitian separable potentials given
by the following kernel:

V (r, r′) =

where µ may, in general, denote an arbitrary ﬁnite set of countable indices µi, i.e.,
and asterisk stands for the complex conjugation.
µ =

Application of Eq. (3.1) to Eq. (2.2) leads us to the Lippmann–Schwinger equation

µ1, . . . , µk}

for the separable potentials:

ψ(r) = φi(r)

where the dagger denotes the matrix Hermitian conjugation. Note that from Eqs.
(3.1) and (3.6) it is evident that the matrix Ω is invertible. We keep this fact for
purposes of further considerations. In the light of Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) we may rewrite
the scattering amplitude (3.4) in the following form:

Here, we turn to the formulation of the eigenchannel method proposed by Szmytkowski

[1]. This author has shown that the eigenchannels provide a powerful mathematical
tool to the quantum theory of scattering. Moreover, in this approach we do not need
to construct the scattering matrix to obtain the formula for an averaged total cross
section.

In the ﬁrst step we rewrite the matrix Ω−1 + G as a sum of its Hermitian and

non–Hermitian parts. Hence, we have

where the matrices A and B are deﬁned by the relations:

Ω−1 + G = A + iB,

and

A =

respectively. From the deﬁnitions (4.2) and (4.3) it is evident that both matrices A
and B are Hermitian, i.e., A = A† and B = B†. Moreover, straightforward calculations
with the aid of Eqs. (2.3) and (3.9) allow us to express their elements as

Following [1] let us consider the following weighted spectral problem

Z

AXγ(E) = λγ(E)BXγ (E),

where Xγ(E) and λγ(E) are, respectively, its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Through-
out the rest of the present paper, the eigenvectors Xγ(E) will be called eigenchannel
vectors. They constitute a representation of eigenchannels, deﬁned in [1] as state vec-
tors, in subspace spanned by the potential functions vµ(r). In fact, the knowledge of
eigenvectors Xγ(E) allows us, by some elementary steps, to construct the eigenchan-
nels.

By virtue of the fact that both A and B are Hermitian with the aid of positive
γ(E) =

semideﬁniteness of the matrix B (for a proof, cf. Appendix A), we infer that λ∗

λγ(E) for all γ. Moreover, it is easy to show that eigenvectors Xγ(E) satisfy the
weighted orthogonality relation

X †

γ′(E)BXγ(E) = 0

(γ′

= γ).

Hence, it is natural to assume the following normalization:

X †

γ′(E)BXγ(E) = δγ′γ,

or, using the matrices A and Ω−1 + G:

(4.7)

(4.8)

X †

γ′(E)AXγ(E) = λγ(E)δγ′γ,

X †

γ′(E)(Ω−1 + G)Xγ(E) = [i + λγ(E)]δγ′γ.

(4.9)

Since the eigenvectors Xγ(E) are solutions of the Hermitian eigenproblem, they should
obey the following closure relations:

Xγ(E)X †

γ(E)B = I,

λ−1
γ (E)Xγ(E)X †

and

Xγ(E)X †

γ(E)(Ω−1 + G) = I.

(4.11)

Henceforth, we shall be assuming that the potential (3.1) is such that the above
relations are satisﬁed. Therefore, it is possible to express the matrix (Ω−1 + G)−1 in
terms of the eigenchannel vectors Xγ(E). Indeed, using Eq. (4.11) we have

As already mentioned the above result was obtained without prior construction of the
scattering matrix. It is also necessary to emphasize that the method used gives formula
for scattering amplitude which has very similar form to one obtained for potentials
Yγ(k) reduce to
with spherical symmetry V (r) [16]. For such potentials the functions
the spherical harmonics Ylm(ˆk). Subsequently, combining relation (4.19) with (2.8)

5 Example

To illustrate the method, let us consider scattering from a pair of identical spheres,
of radii R. The symmetry of this target allows us to locate the origin of a coordinate
system in the midpoint of the interval joining the centers of spheres. Thus, we may
̺. However, due to the assumption
choose the spheres to be centered at points r =

further simplicity the strengths of both spheres were taken to be equal and have value

Note that the results (5.17) and (5.18) may be equivalently obtained after application
of Eqs. (5.10) and (5.13), respectively, to Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21).

A Positive semideﬁniteness of the matrix B
The proof is due to R. Szmytkowski [17]. Below we show that the matrix B given by
Eq. (4.3) is such that, the inequality

is satisﬁed. Since

we may rewrite Eq. (4.5) in the form

As one can notice with the aid of Eq.
proportional to an element of the matrix B. Hence, we arrive at

(4.5), the expression in square brackets is

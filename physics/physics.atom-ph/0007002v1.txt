Using a laser that is frequency-locked to a Fabry-
P´erot ´etalon of high ﬁnesse and stability, we probe the
5d106s 2S1/2(F=0)↔5d96s2 2D5/2(F=2) ∆mF =0 electric-
quadrupole transition of a single laser-cooled 199Hg+ ion
stored in a cryogenic radio-frequency ion trap. We observe
Fourier-transform limited linewidths as narrow as 6.7 Hz at
282 nm (1.06 × 1015 Hz), yielding a line Q ≈ 1.6 × 1014.
We perform a preliminary measurement of the 5d96s2 2D5/2
electric-quadrupole shift due to interaction with the static
ﬁelds of the trap, and discuss the implications for future
trapped-ion optical frequency standards.

Precision spectroscopy has held an enduring place in
physics, particularly in the elucidation of atomic struc-
ture and the measurement of fundamental constants, in
the development of accurate clocks, and for fundamen-
tal tests of physical laws. Two ingredients of paramount
importance are high accuracy, that is, the uncertainty
in systematic frequency shifts must be small, and high
signal-to-noise ratio, since the desired measurement pre-
cision must be reached in a practical length of time. In
this paper, we report the measurement of an optical ab-
sorption line in a single laser-cooled 199Hg+ ion at a fre-
quency ν0 = 1.06 × 1015 Hz (wavelength ≈ 282 nm)
for which a linewidth ∆ν = 6.7 Hz is observed, yield-
ing the highest Q ≡ ν0/∆ν ever achieved for optical (or
lower frequency) spectroscopy. We also report a prelim-
inary measurement of the interaction of the upper state
electric-quadrupole moment with the static ﬁeld gradi-
ents of the ion trap, which is expected to contribute the
largest uncertainty for a frequency standard based on this
system.

In spectroscopy and for clocks, ﬂuctuations in fre-
quency measurement are usually expressed fraction-
ally:
σy(τ ) = ∆νmeas(τ )/ν0, where τ is the to-
tal measurement time. When the stability is limited
by quantum ﬂuctuations in state detection, σy(τ ) =
C(2πν0)−1(N τprobeτ )− 1
2 , where N is the number of
atoms, τprobe is the transition probe time (typically lim-
ited by the excited-state lifetime or the stability of the lo-
cal oscillator), and C is a constant of order unity that de-
pends on the method of interrogation. For many decades,
the highest accuracies and the greatest stabilities have
been achieved by locking a microwave oscillator to a hy-
perﬁne transition in an atomic ground state [1–5]. Since
the fractional instability σy(τ ) is inversely proportional
to the transition frequency, greater stability can be at-
tained using transitions at higher frequencies such as
those in the optical region of the electromagnetic spec-

trum. Only recently have lasers of suﬃcient spectral
purity become available to probe the narrow resonances
provided by transitions between long-lived atomic states
[6–12]. The stable laser source of Refs. [6,11] and the rel-
ative freedom from environmental perturbation aﬀorded
by ion trapping enable the high resolution reported here.
Combined with novel, highly compact, and accurate laser
frequency measurement schemes [13,14], a trapped-ion
optical frequency standard would appear to have signiﬁ-
cant advantages over present-day atomic clocks.

A partial energy-level diagram of 199Hg+ is shown
in Fig. 1. The 282 nm radiation used to drive the
2S1/2↔2D5/2 transition is produced in a non-linear crys-
tal as the second harmonic of a dye laser oscillating at
563 nm. The frequency of the dye laser radiation is elec-
tronically servoed to match a longitudinal mode of a high-
ﬁnesse Fabry-P´erot cavity that is temperature controlled
and supported on an isolation platform [6,11]. The stabi-
lized laser light is sent through an optical ﬁber to the ta-
ble holding the ion trap. Unavoidable mechanical vibra-
tion of this ﬁber broadens the laser spectrum by nearly
1 kHz. The ﬁber-induced phase-noise is sensed and re-
moved using a method [11] similar to that described in
Ref. [15]. Finally, the frequency of the 563 nm light is
referenced to the electric-quadrupole transition by ﬁrst
frequency-shifting in an acousto-optic modulator (AOM)
and then frequency-doubling in a single pass through a
deuterated ammonium dihydrogen phosphate crystal.

The design of the linear cryogenic ion trap used in these
measurements borrows heavily from our previous work
[4,16,17]. A single 199Hg atom from a thermal source is
ionized by an electron beam and trapped in the harmonic
pseudopotential formed by the rf and static potentials of
a linear quadrupole trap. The trap operates in analogy to
a quadrupole mass ﬁlter having its ends “plugged” with

@
static ﬁelds. The trap electrodes are constructed from
Au-metallized alumina tubes 530 µm in diameter. The
electrode axes are held parallel and coincident with the
vertices of a square of side 1.37 mm by an alumina struc-
ture that facilitates electrical connection and mounting
in the vacuum chamber.

One pair of diagonally opposite electrodes is segmented
by laser micro-machining prior to metallization to permit
application of the axially conﬁning static potential. The
remaining pair of electrodes is driven by a cryogenic cop-
per helical resonator coupled to a 8.6 MHz signal source.
Under typical operating conditions, a single 199Hg+ ion
exhibits secular motion at 1.45 MHz, 1.86 MHz, and
1.12 MHz in the x, y, and z (axial) directions, respec-
tively, as inferred from the vibrational sideband spec-
trum of the ion [18]. In addition, biasing electrodes are
mounted outside the trap rods to cancel any stray static
electric ﬁelds that may be present.

Previous experiments using 199Hg were performed at
room temperature and at a pressure of approximately
10−7 Pa [19]. Under those conditions, the background
gas pressure was large enough that the ion would be lost
due to chemical reaction after only a few minutes. To
circumvent this, the ion trap is housed in a liquid He
vacuum Dewar like that described in [17]. Engineering
particulars of the liquid He cryostat allow low-frequency
(< 100 Hz) vibratory motion of the trap structure rela-
tive to the optical table. Uncorrected, these vibrations
contribute 50 − 1000 Hz of Doppler broadening to the
laser line. We eliminate the majority of this broadening
using an additional stage of Doppler cancellation, where
the correction signal is derived from optical heterodyne
detection of a motion-sensing beam reﬂected from a mir-
ror rigidly aﬃxed to the trap [19]. The resulting cancel-
lation is not ideal, because the sensing beam is steered by
additional optical elements and its path deviates slightly
from overlap with the probe beam near the trap. Mea-
surements indicate that this optical path diﬀerence can
contribute as much as 2 Hz to the spectral width of the
282 nm probe laser in the reference frame of the ion.

The ion is laser-cooled to near the 1.7 mK Doppler
(F=1)↔5d106p
limit by driving the 5d106s 2S1/2
2P1/2 (F=0) cycling transition at 194 nm (Fig. 1) [18].
Because of weak oﬀ-resonant pumping to the 2S1/2 (F=0)
state, we employ a second 194 nm source phase-locked to
the ﬁrst with a 47 GHz oﬀset that returns the ion to the
ground-state F=1 hyperﬁne level. We tolerate the com-
plication of hyperﬁne structure, since only isotopes with
nonzero nuclear spin can have ﬁrst-order magnetic-ﬁeld-
insensitive transitions that provide immunity from ﬂuc-
tuations of the ambient ﬁeld. This signiﬁcantly relaxes
the requirements for control and/or shielding of environ-
mental magnetic sources.

We monitor the ion and deduce its electronic state
using light scattered from the cooling transition. Flu-
orescence at 194 nm is collected by a ﬁve-element uv-
grade fused silica f /1 objective located inside the cryo-

stat. The scattered light is imaged outside the Dewar,
spatially ﬁltered with a 75 µm aperture, and relayed with
a second lens to an imaging photomultiplier tube having
≈ 5% quantum eﬃciency at 194 nm. Transitions to the
2D5/2 state are detected using the technique of “electron
shelving,” which infers the presence of the atom in the
metastable level through the absence of scattering from
the strong laser-cooling transition [18,20]. A metastable-
state detection eﬃciency near unity can be achieved, be-
cause the absorption of a single 282 nm photon suppresses
scattering of many photons from the 194 nm transition
for a period determined by the lifetime of the 2D5/2 state.
The radiation from the 194 nm and 282 nm sources is
admitted to the trap sequentially using mechanical shut-
ters and an AOM, which prevents broadening of the
quadrupole transition by the cooling radiation. Typi-
cal count rates are 2000 Hz for a single ion cycling at
the half-power point of the cooling transition, compared
to only 20 Hz combined laser scatter and photomulti-
plier thermal background when the ion is shelved in the
metastable level.

Spectra of the recoilless “carrier” component of the
2S1/2 (F=0)↔2D5/2 (F=2) ∆mF =0 transition were ob-
tained for a range of probe times and laser intensities by
laser cooling for 30 ms, preparing the ion in the F= 0
ground state by blocking the repumping laser, and then
interrogating the quadrupole transition. The spectra are
built up from multiple bidirectional scans of the 282 nm
probe laser frequency. Since the frequency drift of the
probe laser is not precisely compensated, nor is it con-
stant, we incorporate a locking step in between pairs of
positive- and negative-going frequency sweeps about the
center of the quadrupole resonance.
In the locking se-
quence, we step the frequency of the probe laser alter-
nately to the approximate half-maximum on either side of
the quadrupole resonance, probe for a ﬁxed time τservo,
and then look for transitions to the 2D5/2 level. Typ-
ically, 48 measurements are made on each side of the
resonance during each lock cycle. The asymmetry be-
tween the number of quantum jumps detected on the
high- and low-frequency sides of the resonance is used to
correct the frequency of a synthesizer used to compen-
sate for cavity drift.
In this fashion, variations in the
frequency of the 282 nm laser for times exceeding several
seconds are reduced. Using the locking step alone with
τservo = 40 ms, the error signal from the lock indicates
a fractional frequency instability σy(τ ) = 1.5 × 10−15 for
times comparable to the length of the combined servo and
scanning cycle (15-60 s). This is worse than the quantum
projection-noise-limited stability (≈ 5×10−16) but is con-
sistent with ﬂuctuating quadratic Zeeman shifts arising
from variations in the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. The trap
was not magnetically shielded during the measurements
reported here.

Spectra are plotted in Fig. 2 for a variety of probe
times τprobe = 20 − 120 ms, with τservo = τprobe. The
linewidths of all the spectra are transform limited by the

∆f282 is the frequency of the 282 nm probe laser detuning, and
Pg is the probability of ﬁnding the atom in the ground state.
The four plots correspond to excitation with 282 nm pulses
of diﬀerent lengths: (a) 20 ms (averaged over 292 sweeps),
(b) 40 ms (158 sweeps), (c) 80 ms (158 sweeps), and (d)

ﬁnite probe time, decreasing to 6.7 Hz in the uv at
120 ms, the longest time used. The carrier transition
amplitude is a function of the initial value of the vibra-
tional quantum number n (see, for example, Eqn. 31 of
Ref. [22]). Since for our trapping parameters hni ≈ 35
at the Doppler cooling limit, it is not possible to transfer
the electron to the 2D5/2 state with unit probability. The
observed signals are in good agreement with the theoret-
ical expectation, and the signal loss for τprobe = 120 ms
(Fig. 2(d)) is consistent with applying the probe for
a time that exceeds the natural lifetime of the 2D5/2
state by 33%. This result corresponds to a fractional
frequency resolution of 6.3 × 10−15, which we believe
is the smallest reported for excitation with an opti-
cal or microwave source. The result is surpassed only
by M¨ossbauer spectroscopy in ZnO, where a fractional
linewidth of 2.5 × 10−15 was achieved using a nuclear
source of 93 keV gamma rays [21], which is not practical
for use in an atomic clock. The measurements reported
here illustrate the potential of a single-ion optical fre-
quency standard and conﬁrm the phase stability of our
probe laser system, validating the results of the hetero-
dyne comparison of the two reference cavities [6,11]. An
excellent review of the performance of similar systems
can be found in Ref. [12].

Figure 3 shows a typical power-broadened spectrum
with consequent Rabi “sidebands,” using τprobe = 10 ms

ber hni=73(9). This is twice the value of hni expected at
the Doppler cooling limit; the larger result is likely due
to saturation of the cooling transition.

In Fig. 4 we plot the central three Ramsey fringes of
a time-domain separated-oscillatory-ﬁelds interrogation
of the 2S1/2↔2D5/2 transition with 5 ms pulses sepa-
rated by a 20 ms free-precession interval. In operation
as a frequency standard, the Ramsey method oﬀers 1.6×
reduction in linewidth (and a corresponding increase in
stability) for an equivalent measurement period.

It should be possible to reduce the uncertainties of
all systematic shifts in this system including the second-
order Doppler (time-dilation) shift and static or dynamic
Zeeman and Stark shifts to values approaching 10−18.
The electric-quadrupole shift of the 2D5/2 F=2 (mF =0)
state arising from coupling with the static potentials of
the trap is expected to be the limiting systematic contri-
bution in future measurements of the absolute value of
the 2S1/2↔2D5/2 transition frequency, because of the dif-
ﬁculty in determining with certainty the magnitude and
conﬁguration of the static ﬁelds of the trap. In princi-
ple, it is possible to eliminate this shift by measuring the
quadrupole transition frequencies for each of three mu-
tually orthogonal orientations of a quantizing magnetic
ﬁeld of constant magnitude; the mean value is then the
unperturbed 2S1/2↔2D5/2 transition frequency. We fol-
low this procedure for several values of the total magnetic
induction and for all possible directions in a suitable co-
ordinate system (e.g. [1 1 1], [1 -1 -1], [-1 -1 1], where [1
1 1] is elevated 45◦ from the trap axis and 45◦ from the
vertical plane). Using the ion as a magnetometer, the
magnitude of the ﬁeld produced by three sets of coils is

Ramsey interrogation of the electric-quadrupole transition.
∆f282 is the frequency of the 282 nm probe laser detuning,
and Pg is the probability of ﬁnding the atom in the ground
state. The data are averaged over 328 frequency sweeps with
τservo = 40 ms. The solid line is the expected Ramsey signal
for 5 ms pulses separated by 20 ms of free precession; the

calibrated by the measurement of the frequency of the
F=0 → 2 (∆mF = 2) magnetic ﬁeld-dependent electric-
quadrupole transition. For an ideal linear trap with sec-
ular frequencies ωx = ωy and ωz = 2π(1 MHz), we calcu-
late a shift that varies between +7.5 Hz and −15 Hz de-
pending on ﬁeld orientation. The estimate of the atomic
quadrupole moment is based on Hartree-Fock wavefunc-
tions for the ground state of Hg+, which yield the matrix
element h5d|r2|5di = 6.61×10−21 m2 [23]. In our appara-
tus we observe shifts departing from the mean frequency
by +12(7) Hz, +9(13) Hz, and −27(7) Hz for the three
ﬁeld orientations at 282 nm,
in reasonable agreement
with the simple model. The quoted uncertainties arise
from imprecision in our ability to set the absolute magni-
tude and direction of the magnetic induction. Thus the
fractional frequency uncertainty is of order 10−14, and
we might reduce this below 10−15 in the present appara-
tus with straightforward improvements to the magnetic
shielding and control. Uncertainties approaching 10−18
should be obtainable through stringent control of mag-
netic ﬁelds in combination with a spherical rf quadrupole
trap geometry that does not rely on static potentials
for conﬁnement. Greater resolution and accuracy might
be more readily achieved using a diﬀerent type of tran-
sition, e.g., the weak hyperﬁne-induced electric-dipole
transitions like those between the low-lying 1S0 and 3P0
states of the singly-ionized species of the Group IIIA el-
ements of the periodic table [12,24,25], particularly in
cases where ﬁrst-order magnetic-ﬁeld independent tran-
sitions are available (albeit at nonzero ﬁeld) [26].

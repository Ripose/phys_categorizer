The circular polarized laser beam of the “magic” wavelength may be used for mixing the 3P1
state into the long-living metastable state 3P0, thus enabling the strictly forbidden 1S0
3P0 ”clock”
transition in even isotopes of alkaline-earth-like atoms, without change of the transition frequency.
In odd isotopes the laser beam may adjust to an optimum value the line width of the ”clock” tran-
sition, originally enabled by the hyperﬁne mixing. We present a detailed analysis of various factors
inﬂuencing resolution and uncertainty for an optical frequency standard based on atoms exposed
simultaneously to the lattice standing wave and an additional ”state-mixing” wave, including esti-
mations of the “magic” wavelengths, Rabi frequencies for the ”clock” and state-mixing transitions,
ac Stark shifts for the ground and metastable states of divalent atoms.

Extremely narrow atomic line corresponding to a
3P0 transition between ground and
strictly forbidden 1S0−
metastable states of alkaline-earth-like atoms (such as
Mg, Ca, Sr, Yb, Zn, Cd), currently considered as worth-
while candidates for an optical frequency standard, may
be observed either on free odd isotopes [1, 2, 3] or on even
isotopes in external ﬁelds [4, 5, 6, 7]. The mixing of the
3P1 and 3P0 states by the hyperﬁne interaction in the odd
isotopes and by an external ﬁeld in the even isotopes is
the basic eﬀect which removes the general selection-rule
restrictions on the 0
Intensive
investigations of even alkaline-earth-like isotopes during
the last few years were stimulated by a possibility to
design a new frequency standard based on an oscillator
with the record high quality Q-factor. In all the methods
3P0
based on interrogation of the strongly forbidden 1S0−
transition in the even isotopes embedded into an opti-
cal lattice, engineered so as to equalize the upper- and
lower-level Stark shifts, some additional radiation [4, 5]
or static [6, 7] ﬁelds were applied.

In this article, we propose to use a circularly (ellipti-
cally) polarized wave of the “magic” wavelength λmag
(corresponding to the so-called “Stark-cancellation”
regime, see e.g. [1, 8]), in addition to the optical lattice
ﬁeld, in order to mix the 3P1 state to the 3P0 state. Since
in even isotopes the nuclear momentum equals zero, both
the initial and the ﬁnal states of the frequency standard
transition (the “clock” transition) have zero total mo-

menta, without hyperﬁne structure splitting and with-
out antisymmetric and tensor increments to the ac dipole
polarizabilities and to the Stark eﬀect. This makes the
Stark shift of the upper and lower levels independent of
polarization of external ﬁelds. Meanwhile the circular
polarization of a laser wave allows for the second-order
dipole-dipole mixing of the 3P1 state to the metastable
3P0 state, which is strictly forbidden for the linear polar-
ization.

So, the role of the optical lattice ﬁeld consists in trap-
ping neutral atoms eﬀectively free from collisions and
Doppler eﬀect (Lamb-Dicke regime) as well as from the
light ﬁeld perturbations [1], whereas an additional beam
of the magic frequency, but with compulsory circular
(elliptic) polarization, will enable the strictly forbidden
radiation transitions via mixing the 3P1 state to the
metastable 3P0 state. The two waves may be generated
by one and the same laser or be completely independent,
each properly adjusted to some particular conditions. So
they may have diﬀerent intensities, polarizations, wave
vectors and even diﬀerent wavelengths, subject, however,
to the Stark-cancellation regime. In contrast with other
methods [4]–[7], in this approach the atoms are exposed
to only the magic-wavelength radiation, no additional ac
or dc ﬁeld is used and therefore no additional shift of the
clock frequency can arise.

The origin of the laser radiation-induced mixing con-
sists in the possibility of the second-order dipole transi-

tion between the 3P1 state and the metastable 3P0 state
in ac ﬁeld of a “magic” frequency ω=ωm=2πc/λmag (c
is the speed of light) with a circular (elliptical) polariza-
tion. To this end, together with the standing wave of the
optical lattice, a circularly polarized wave of the magic
frequency should be used, which we further consider as
the running wave with the electric ﬁeld vector

where Fr is a real scalar amplitude, e is a complex unit

the unit vector n which should have a non-zero com-
ponent at right angle to the optical lattice beam in or-
der that interrogation wave could travel along the lat-
tice in compliance with the Doppler-cancellation con-
ditions (for simplicity, we assume a 1D lattice here).

Actually, the amplitude (2) may be compared to the
amplitude of the hyperﬁne interaction, which mixes the
states in the odd isotopes [8, 10], or to the magnetic-
ﬁeld-induced amplitude when the atoms experience the
action of a magnetic ﬁeld, which may also be used for
3P1 state mixing [6, 7]. Numerical computations

use of the model potential method for analytical presen-
tation of the radial wave functions [9, 10], gave the nu-
merical values of the antisymmetric polarizabilities pre-
sented in Table I for Mg, Ca, Sr, Yb, Zn and Cd atoms at

As follows from the data of Table I, at the inten-
sity Ir=0.5 M W/cm2, the absolute value of the magic-
wave-induced amplitude (5) may amount to 10 MHz for
atoms of Ca, Sr and Yb, that is equivalent to the am-
plitude induced by a magnetic ﬁeld of 1 mT [6]. With
account of the data for the spin-orbit splitting of the
lowest (metastable) triplet state 3PJ (see e.g.
[14]) the
admixture of the 3P1 state in the 3P0-state wave func-
tion at these conditions does not exceed 10−5. Similar
estimates indicate that the 1P1 singlet state admixture
in (7) at these conditions is yet 4 to 5 orders smaller.

However, the 3P1-state admixture may be suﬃcient to
enable the radiation transition between the ground and
metastable states and to amplify the magnitude of the
3P0 level width by 7 to 9 orders (in comparison with a
two-photon E1-M1 or three-photon E1 spontaneous ra-
diation decay width [10]), up to several mHz, making
3P0 well detectable, on the one
the clock transition 1S0→
hand, and on the other hand, retaining the 3P0 level width
in bosonic atoms essentially smaller than in fermionic.

Together with the radiative decay rate (9), the impor-
3P0
tant characteristic of the magic-wave-induced 1S0−
dipole transition, probed by the clock-frequency radia-
tion, is the amplitude (Rabi frequency) of the clock tran-
sition which after integration in angular variables may be

the splitting ∆10 is in cm−1. According to the calculated
numerical values of β (see Table II), the Rabi frequency
in Sr and Yb atoms (10) may achieve 0.3 Hz for the
ﬁeld (1) intensity Ir=0.5 M W/cm2 and the probe ﬁeld
of Ip=10 mW/cm2.

In the Stark-cancellation regime, when the second-
order ac Stark shifts (4) of the clock levels are made equal
to one another, the clock frequency may be distorted by
the probe-ﬁeld-induced quadratic ac Stark shift (linear in
p ) and the fourth-order ac Stark shifts
intensity Ip
of the clock levels (quadratic in intensities IL
L and
r , correspondingly), induced by the lattice ﬁeld
Ir
and the mixing wave, also including the bilinear in the
intensities IL and Ir fourth-order correction. This shift
may be written as

where the constant κ(1)(ωc) is determined by the diﬀer-
ence of the upper- and lower-level polarizabilities at the

−

where polarizabilities α3P0(ωc) and α1S0(ωc) are in atomic

The coeﬃcients κ(2) are determined by the diﬀerence of
the clock-state hyperpolarizabilities at the ”magic” fre-
quency ωm (similar to polarizabilities, the hyperpolariz-
abilities for states with the total momentum J=0 include
only scalar parts, which, however, depend on the wave
polarization vector e [9, 11]),

with the antisymmetric polarizability and the radial part
of the dipole transition matrix element in atomic units,

where κ(2) is in the units of Hz/(M W/cm2)2, the hyper-
polarizabilities γ1S0(e, ωm) and γ3P0 (e, ωm) are in atomic

units. Although we assume the same ”magic” frequency
ωm for the lattice and running waves, the hyperpolar-
izabilities for the linear polarization may diﬀer essen-
tially from those for the circular polarization [9, 11], i.e.
κ(2)(eL, ωm)
= κ(2)(e, ωm) for diﬀerent polarization vec-
tors eL and e. The clock-level hyperpolarizabilities de-
termining the coeﬃcient κ(2)(eL, e, ωm) of the interfer-
ence term, bilinear in the lattice-wave and running-wave
intensities, depend on the relative orientation (and the
type – linear or circular) of polarization vectors eL and
e. That is why the fourth-order corrections from the
both waves should be taken into account together with
the mixed bilinear correction κ(2)(eL, e, ωm)ILIr.

The numerical estimates of κ(1)(ωc) and κ(2)(e, ωm) for
the circular polarization of the laser beam e are presented
in table II. The hyperpolarizabilities for the metastable
3P0 levels of the Mg, Zn and Cd atoms are complex values
with imaginary parts (determining the two-photon ion-
ization width) negligible in comparison with real parts.
In estimating real parts of the hyperpolarizabilities in
Mg, Zn and Cd, we took into account only the “resonant”
terms, which may be determined by the antisymmetric
and tensor polarizabilities of the levels [15].

The values of susceptibilities κ(1) and κ(2) of Table II
are the useful data to control the higher-order correc-
tions appearing when the probe-wave and running-wave
intensities increase. However, the strong dependencies
of κ(2) both on the polarization and on the frequency
stimulate detailed investigations of the higher-order light
shifts in the close vicinity of the magic-wave frequency
(see e.g. [16, 17]). Given the values κ(1) and κ(2), all the
combination of the probe-wave and higher-order shifts
(12) becomes controllable and may in certain conditions
be reduced to zero, using appropriate intensities IL, Ir,
Ip, and polarization eL and e of the lattice and mixing
waves.

[6],

In summary, we propose a new possibility to access
the strongly forbidden single-photon 0-0 transition of a
bosonic alkaline-earth-like atom supported by a magic-
frequency wave with circular (elliptic) polarization. This
approach may be considered as an alternative or an ad-
dition to the method of refs.
[7], where a mag-
netic ﬁeld is used.
It seems rather worthwhile for the
lattice-based optical atomic clock with the magic-wave-
supported strongly forbidden transition of even alkaline-
earth-like isotopes. In the case of a 2D or 3D lattice, the
running wave (1) may be replaced by one of the stand-
ing waves, which should be circular polarized and per-
pendicular to the probe laser beam. The circular polar-
ization of the standing wave coincides with that of the
incident wave whereas the amplitude near antinodes of
the standing wave is twice as big as the incident-wave
amplitude. In this case the space inhomogeneity of the
mixing ﬁeld should be taken into account, but if atoms
occupy the lowest vibration states of the lattice and lo-

4

cate near antinodes then the ﬁeld amplitude ”seen” by an
atom is double what it is in the incident wave, therefore
the coeﬃcients in the right-hand sides of equations (2),
(5) and (10) can be multiplied by 4. It means that the
Rabi frequencies (5) and (10) for the given laser input
intensity may become 4 times greater for the standing
wave in comparison with the running wave, in particu-
lar, in Sr and Yb atoms, W10=40 M Hz and Ω=1.2 Hz
for Ir=0.5 M W/cm2 and Ip=10 mW/cm2.

Abstract

A new approach to ﬁnite basis sets for the Dirac equation is developed. It

solves the problem of spurious states and, as a result, improves the conver-

gence properties of basis set calculations. The eﬃciency of the method is

demonstrated for ﬁnite basis sets constructed from B splines by calculating

the one-loop self-energy correction for a hydrogenlike ion.

At present, a great variety of calculations in atomic physics and quantum chemistry

are based on ﬁnite basis sets. First successful attempts to utilize ﬁnite basis sets in rel-

ativistic quantum mechanics were made many years ago [1–6]. Application of B splines

for constructing basis sets [7–9] provided new impact to this ﬁeld. Nowdays, B splines are

widely employed in computational atomic and molecular physics (see [10,11] and references

therein).

In contrast to the nonrelativistic case, the use of ﬁnite basis sets in the relativistic

theory is generally accompanied by the occurrence of spurious states (see, e.g., [4,9]). For

the attractive Coulomb potential, spurious states appear for κ > 0 as the lowest bound states

with non-physical energies (κ = (−1)j+l+1/2(j + 1/2) is the quantum number determined by

the angular momentum and the parity of the state). For the point nucleus, their energies

coincide with the physical energies of the lowest bound states with κ < 0. The wave functions

of these states oscillate rapidly and, therefore, in many cases they may be disregarded in

practical atomic calculations. However, since the presence of the spurious states disturbs the

spectrum, it worsens the convergence properties of the basis set calculations in some cases.

For this reason, despite of the early promising results [13,14], the ﬁnite basis set method

has not been extensively employed in calculations of radiative corrections. To date, most of

these calculations are performed by means of analytical or numerical representations for the

Coulomb-Green function (see, e.g., [15–18]) or by the space discretization method [19–21],

in which the spurious states are eliminated from the very beginning (see [19] for details).

The problem of spurious states is especially demanding in calculations of atoms in strong

external ﬁelds and for molecules, where, generally speaking, they can not be selected as the

lowest bound-state energies and, therefore, can not be eliminated without employing special

methods. Furthermore, even in those cases where spurious states do not play any signiﬁcant

role, their presence generates diﬃculties for providing an adequate estimate of the accuracy

of the calculations.

A number of proposals for solving the problem of spurious states were presented previ-

ously [22,9,23–25]. Our analysis of these methods indicates, however, that none of them can

2

be considered as completely satisfactory. We ﬁnd that treating the problem by a particular

choice of the boundary conditions in the B-spline method [9] does not provide any improve-

ment in calculations of radiative corrections. The other methods either require considerable

modiﬁcations of the standard numerical procedure or they are strongly limited to a speciﬁc

choice of ﬁnite basis sets. Their applicability to calculations of radiative corrections thus

remains questionable. For this reason, we suggest a new method for solving the problem of

spurious states. The eﬃciency of the method is demonstrated for ﬁnite basis sets constructed

from B splines by calculating the one-loop self-energy correction for a hydrogenlike ion.

For the case of a central ﬁeld V (r), the Dirac wave function is conveniently represented

where n = r/r. With this representation, the radial Dirac equations can be written as

by

be approximated by

φ(r) =

where the two-component functions ui(r) are assumed to be square integrable, linearly in-

dependent, and satisfying proper boundary condition at r = 0. The variational principle

reduces to the following algebraic equations

dS/dci = 0 ,

i = 1, 2, ..., 2n .

This leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem

Kikck = EBikck ,

where Kik = (hui|Hκ|uki + huk|Hκ|uii)/2, Bik = hui|uki, and the summation over repeated

indices is implied.

Let us ﬁrst demonstrate that the widely applied choice

where {πi(r)}n

i=1 are square integrable functions satisfying the boundary condition πi(0) = 0,

results in the occurrence of spurious states. In this case, equation (9) takes the form

and pi = ci, qi = ci+n for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Let us consider the nonrelativistic limit (c → ∞)

and introduce vectors P and Q with components {pi}n

i=1 and {qi}n

i=1, respectively. Then Eq.

(13) yields Q = (1/2mc)D†P . Substituting this expression into Eq. (12), we obtain

DD†P + 2m(mc2 + V − E)P = 0 .

For the pure Coulomb ﬁeld, V (r) = −λ/r (λ > 0), introducing the matrix Cik = Dik −

(mλ/κ)δik, Eq. (17) reduces to

where ǫ = [2m(E − mc2) + m2λ2/κ2] and the dependence of the C matrix on κ is explicitly

indicated. Taking into account that C−κ = −C †

κ, we ﬁnd that the corresponding equation

for κ′ = −κ can be written as

CκC †

κP = ǫP ,

C †

κCκP ′ = ǫ′P ′ .

Multiplying Eq. (18) with C †

κ, we obtain that each nonzero eigenvalue of CκC †

κ is an eigen-

value of C †

κCκ. Evidently, the inverse statement can be proven in a similar manner and the

dimension of a nonzero eigenvalue subspace is the same for CκC †

κ and C †

κCκ. Accordingly,

the spectra of CκC †

κ and C †

κCκ may diﬀer only by the dimension of the zero eigenvalue

subspace. For ﬁnite matrices, the dimension of the subspace with ǫ = 0 is the same for

CκC †

κ and C †

κCκ, since the total number of eigenvectors as well as the dimension of the

nonzero eigenvalues subspace is the same for CκC †

κ and C †

κCκ. Therefore, the ﬁnite matrices

CκC †

κ and C †

κCκ = C−κC †

−κ have an identical spectrum. Conversely, we know that the exact

analytical solution of the Dirac equation for the Coulomb potential yields diﬀerent lowest

bound-state energies for κ < 0 and κ > 0. This is due to the fact that within the exact

5

(inﬁnite dimension) treatment the subspace with ǫ = 0 may have diﬀerent dimensions for

κ < 0 and κ > 0 cases. This can easily be checked by solving the equation

(d/dr + κ/r − mλ/κ)G(r) = 0 ,

(20)

which in case of ﬁnite dimensions is equivalent to the equation C †

κP = 0. Solving equation

(20) yields G(r) = A0r−κ exp (mλ/κr). For κ < 0, this solution has the proper behaviour

at r → 0 and at r → ∞. However, this does not hold for κ > 0. Concluding, in the

approximation of ﬁnite dimensions, our proof clearly indicates the presence of spurious

states with energy E − mc2 = −mλ2/2κ2 corresponding to ǫ = 0. It can be shown that this

result remains valid for the full relativistic theory as well. It is obvious that spurious states

must occur for any other potential one is dealing with in atomic calculations.

To eliminate the spurious states, in Ref. [23] ”kinetically balanced” Slater type functions

were employed. Within this method, for κ > 0 the lower components in equation (11)

are replaced by functions ρi(r) which, in the nonrelativistic limit, are related to the upper

components πi(r) in equation (10) via

ρi(r) ≈ (1/2mc)(d/dr + κ/r)πi(r) .

(21)

This method provides a high accuracy in calculations of bound-state energies in atoms for

both sign of κ, if an extended nuclear charge distribution is introduced and proper bound-

ary conditions are implemented [23]. However, since the basis functions are ”kinetically

balanced” for positive energy states only, the application of this method to calculations of

the QED corrections might be problematic [26]. The equivalent treatment of positive and

negative energy states would provide, in particular, the well-known symmetry properties of

the Dirac spectrum under the transformations V → −V , κ → −κ, and G ↔ F . It is evident

that the ”kinetically balanced” functions do not meet with this requirement.

In the original version of the B-spline method [8–10], to achieve that the ﬁrst positive-

energy states κ > 0 correspond to physical bound states, an additional term had to be

introduced in the Hamiltonian, which formally implements the so-called MIT boundary

6

condition [12]: G(R) = F (R), where R is the cavity radius, together with the condition

G(0) = 0. However, since the presence of the additional term does not imply any practical

advantages, it is usually omitted in calculations.

Instead, the boundary conditions are

generally implemented by eliminating the ﬁrst and the last basis function which are the only

ones that do not vanish at r = 0 and r = R, respectively. This method was successfully

employed for calculations of the two-photon exchange diagrams within the rigorous QED

approach [27–31] and for relativistic calculations of the recoil eﬀect [32–34]. However, its

application to calculations of pure radiative corrections [13,14] was less successful, compared

to the other methods [15–18,20,21]. We conjecture that this would not be the case if the

spurious states were eliminated in a more natural manner than it was done in [8,9].

It is known (see, e.g., [14,10,23]) that the case of the pure Coulomb potential requires

generally a special care in implementing ﬁnite basis set methods. This is due to the singu-

larity of the Coulomb potential at r → 0. However, in practical calculations it is standard

to modify the potential to account for the ﬁnite nuclear size, which eliminates this problem.

For this reason and for simplicity, we restrict our consideration to the case of a ﬁnite nu-

clear charge distribution, bearing in mind that the limit of a point nucleus can be treated

by extrapolating a series of calculations for extended nuclei to vanishing nuclear size. For

extended nuclei we propose to employ the following basis set

(23)

where the linearly independent functions {πi(r)}n

i=1 are assumed to be square integrable and

satisfying the proper boundary condition at r = 0. We state that this basis set satisﬁes the

following requirements:

1. It is symmetric with respect to the replacement κ → −κ and the interchange of the

upper and lower components.

7

2. The functions u1, ..., un provide the correct relation between upper and lower compo-

nents for |E − mc2|, |V (r)| ≪ 2mc2, while the functions un+1, ..., u2n do the same for

|E + mc2|, |V (r)| ≪ 2mc2.

3. Calculations utilizing the standard ﬁnite basis set determined by Eqs. (10) and (11)

can be easily adopted when employing the basis (22)-(23).

4. No spurious states occur for attractive as well as for repulsive potentials.

The properties 1 - 3 follow immediately from deﬁnitions (22) and (23). The absence of

spurious states can be explained as follows. Performing similar steps as for the derivation

of Eq. (17), for |E − mc2| ≪ 2mc2 we obtain

Eq. (24) takes the form of the ordinary Schr¨odinger equation with l = |κ| + (κ/|κ| − 1)/2

in the ﬁnite basis representation. As is known, it generates no spurious states. The region

|E + mc2| ≪ 2mc2, where spurious states may exist for repulsive potentials and for κ < 0,

can be considered similarly. In this case, we obtain the equation

Eq. (26) has also the form of the ordinary Schr¨odinger equation but with l′ = |κ| − (κ/|κ| +

1)/2. It transforms into equation (24) under the replacements κ → −κ, V → −V , E → −E,

Q → P and does not generate any spurious states. This is a consequence of the equivalent

8

treatment of the positive and negative energy states. For this reason, the new basis may be

termed conventionally as dual kinetic-balance (DKB) basis.

The validity of statement 4 has also been proven by numerical calculations with πi(r) =

Bi(r), where Bi(r) are the B splines deﬁned on the interval (0, R) as in Ref. [9]. The ﬁrst

and the last spline function have been omitted. Standard test calculations (see, e.g., [9])

show that this basis satisﬁes suitable completeness criteria as n → ∞.

Finally, let us consider the calculation of the one-loop self-energy (SE) correction to

the ground-state energy of a hydrogenlike ion employing the new basis set. Generally, the

SE correction is expanded into the zero-, one-, and many-potential terms. The ultraviolet

divergences in the zero- and one-potential terms and in the counterterm cancel each other

and their evaluation can be performed according to the formulas presented in Refs. [35,36].

As to the many-potential term, although it does not contain any ultraviolet divergences, its

calculation is most diﬃcult since it involves the summation over the whole Dirac-Coulomb

spectrum.

In Table 1, we compare our results obtained for the many-potential term for

Z = 20 employing the DKB basis set (22), (23) with πi(r) = Bi(r), the old basis (10), (11)

with the same πi(r), and the results of a calculation using the analytical representation for

the Coulomb-Green function. The shell model for the nuclear charge distribution has been

used with the radius R = 3.478 fm. In the basis set calculations, the contributions with

|κ| ≥ 10 were obtained by an extrapolation. Adding the zero- and one-potential terms to the

many-potential term yields 0.06409 a.u. for the old basis, 0.06426 a.u. for the DKB basis,

and 0.06425(1) a.u. for the Coulomb-Green function calculation. This comparison clearly

demonstrates a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy, if the DKB basis is employed instead

of the old one. More extensive calculations employing the DKB basis will be presented in

forthcoming papers.

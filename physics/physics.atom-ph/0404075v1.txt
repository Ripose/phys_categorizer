We report on the observation of ultra long-range interactions in a gas of cold Rubidium Rydberg
atoms. The van-der-Waals interaction between a pair of Rydberg atoms separated as far as 100,000
Bohr radii features two important eﬀects: Spectral broadening of the resonance lines and suppression
of excitation with increasing density. The density dependence of these eﬀects is investigated in detail
for S-, P- and D-Rydberg states with main quantum numbers n ∼ 60 and n ∼ 80 excited by narrow-
band continuous-wave laser light. The spectral broadening of the P-states is compared to ab initio
interaction potentials. The density-dependent suppression of excitation can be interpreted as the
onset of an interaction-induced local blockade.

With the advances in laser cooling and trapping tech-
niques, new intriguing perspectives for the investiga-
tion of Rydberg atoms [1] have been opening. When
cooled to very low temperatures, the core motion can
be neglected for the timescales of Rydberg excitation
(“frozen Rydberg gas”). Unexpected eﬀects have been
discovered, such as the many-body diﬀusion of excitation
[2, 3], the population of high-angular-momentum states
through free charges [4], or the spontaneous formation
and recombination of ultracold plasmas [5, 6]. Other fas-
cinating features of cold, interacting Rydberg atoms have
been proposed but not been observed so far, including
the creation of ultralong-range molecules [7, 8], whereas
molecular crossover resonances have already been found
experimentally [9]. One of the most outstanding proper-
ties of Rydberg atoms is their high polarizability, caused
by the large distance between the outer electron and
the core. Rydberg atoms are thus very sensitive to
electric ﬁelds and are expected to exhibit strong long-
range dipole-dipole and van-der-Waals (vdW) interac-
tions. First indications of interaction eﬀects between
Rydberg gases at high densities have been found in an
atomic beam experiment [10] and recent collisional evi-
dence for ultralong-range interactions in a Rydberg gas
has been reported [11]. In a frozen gas these interactions
make Rydberg atoms possible candidates for quantum
information processing [12, 13]. One promising approach
is based on the concept of a dipole blockade [13], i.e. the
inhibition of multiple Rydberg excitations in a conﬁned
volume due to interaction-induced energy shifts.

In this Letter we report on experimental evidence for
ultra-long range interactions in a frozen Rydberg gas,
which are interpreted as the onset of the dipole block-
ade, and we present high-resolution spectroscopic signa-

tures of these interactions. Similar indications of sup-
pressed excitation have recently been observed in pulsed
Rydberg excitation from a cold gas [14]. In contrast to
these ﬁndings, our experiment makes use of a tunable
narrow-bandwidth continuous-wave (cw) laser for Ryd-
berg excitation and thus allows for high-resolution spec-
troscopy of the resonance lines. By varying the density
of Rydberg atoms the inﬂuence of interactions on the
strength and the shape of these lines is investigated in
detail. Interaction-induced features in both the broad-
ening of the lines and saturation of the resonance peak
height are observed.

To realize a frozen gas of Rydberg atoms we trap
about 107 87Rb atoms in a dispenser-loaded magneto-
optical trap (MOT). The MOT is located inside a vacuum
chamber (background pressure 5 × 10−11mbar) which
consists mainly of a spherical cube with good optical
access along the three main orthogonal axes and the
two diagonals. The MOT coils are located inside the
vacuum chamber. The trapping laser light is provided
by a diode laser system consisting of two diode lasers
which are simultaneously injection-locked to a frequency-
stabilized extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) at 780 nm
and added coherently [15]. The output of this laser-
addition setup is sent through a single-mode optical ﬁber
for mode-cleaning providing about 70 mW at the output.
The frequency is detuned by 1.5Γ (natural line width
Γ/2π = 6.1 MHz) to the red of the cooling and trapping
5P3/2, F=3(cid:11)). A second

onal axes of our vacuum chamber and focused to a waist
of 80(10)µm at the center of the atom cloud. The Ryd-
berg atoms are ﬁeld-ionized by applying a voltage of 40
Volts to the central ﬁeld plates consisting of nickel meshes
separated by 13.2 mm with 95% transparency through
which the MOT beams pass almost unperturbed. The
ions are accelerated onto a micro-channel plate detector
(MCP). Residual electrical ﬁelds during Rydberg excita-
tion are mainly caused by the MCP potential of -1.9 kV.
Field components perpendicular to the ﬁeld plates are
compensated by applying a small voltage, while parallel
ﬁeld components are measured to be less than 0.16 V/cm.
The excitation into Rydberg states is schematically
shown in Fig. 1(a). At the beginning of an excitation
cycle, the trapping laser is tuned into resonance. After
15 µs, the blue Rydberg excitation laser which is tuned
to the n ≃ 60 and n ≃ 80 Rydberg manifold is switched
on for 20µs. Since the lifetime of the Rydberg states
is much longer, Rydberg atoms are accumulated during
this time interval. The trapping laser is then reset to the
MOT detuning of -1.5Γ, and an electric ﬁeld of 27 V/cm
is applied to ionize the Rydberg atoms. The excitation
cycle is repeated every 20 ms while maintaining a contin-
uously loaded steady-state MOT. To take an excitation
spectrum, the frequency of the blue laser is repetitively
scanned at a rate of typically 300 MHz/s.

The density of Rydberg atoms can be varied by chang-

nitude as is measured by recording the ﬂuorescence at

780 nm with a photodiode. During this short period of
time, the size of the atom cloud remains unaltered. Due
to the two-step Rydberg excitation scheme, the variation
in the 5P3/2 density is directly transformed into a change
of the number of excited Rydberg atoms, since the ex-
citation volume deﬁned by the overlap of the blue laser
beam with the atom cloud remains ﬁxed. Absolute num-
bers of Rydberg atoms per excitation cycle are obtained
by comparing the number of atoms lost from the trap, as
deduced from the change of ﬂuorescence rate at 780 nm,
with the integrated ion signal. In the same manner, the
nonlinear response of the MCP at large ion signals can be
calibrated. Throughout this paper, the number of Ryd-
berg atoms is derived from the number of measured ions
at the MCP after calibration. Due to the uncertainty in
determination of the MOT size and density, we estimate
the systematic error for the absolute number of Rydberg
atoms to be a factor of 2 while the values for Rydberg
peak densities are uncertain within a factor of roughly 3.
A Rydberg spectrum for n ∼ 80 is depicted in Fig. 1(b).
About 2500 Rydberg atoms are detected for the strong
dipole-allowed D transitions. The resonance line width
is typically ∼ 30 MHz caused by saturation broadening
of the ﬁrst excitation step. Dipole-forbidden P states are
also excited due to the residual electrical ﬁeld. Under
our experimental conditions, the ion formation rate for
n ∼ 80 states through blackbody radiation [1] is esti-
mated from calculated lifetimes [16] to be approximately
200Hz. Ionization rates due to collisions of cold Rydberg
atoms with residual hot Rydberg atoms are of the same
order of magnitude assuming an upper limit of 108 cm−3
for the densities of hot Rydberg atoms. We therefore
do not expect signiﬁcant eﬀects of spontaneous creation
of ions and avalanche processes during the timescales of
excitation (∼ 20 µs) [5].

To study interaction eﬀects between Rydberg atoms,
spectra at diﬀerent Rydberg densities are taken. The
density is changed by either varying the power of the
excitation laser or by changing the density of atoms in
the 5P3/2 state, as described above.
In Fig. 2(a) the
resonance line for the 82S1/2 peak is shown at diﬀerent
Rydberg densities. Fig. 2(a1) and 2(a2) are taken at low
intensity of the blue excitation laser (I = 6 W/cm2) and
at 5P3/2 densities of 0.4 × 109 cm−3 and 2.5 × 109 cm−3,
In this “low excitation regime”, the line

In addition, the number of ex-
shows no broadening.
cited Rydberg atoms on resonance scales linearly with
the 5P3/2 density. The behavior changes drastically when
the intensity of the blue excitation laser is increased to
500 W/cm2. Figs. 2(a3) and (a4) show the resonance line
at 5P3/2 densities of 0.3 × 109 cm−3 and 2.0 × 109 cm−3,
respectively. In the “high excitation” regime character-
ized by Rydberg densities of the order 108 cm−3, one
observes an asymmetric broadening of the line which can
be attributed to level shifts of Rydberg states induced by
the long-range vdW interactions of Rydberg atom pairs
excited from 5P3/2 atoms at a mean distance of ∼ 10 µm.
Similar broadening eﬀects have been observed earlier in

an atomic beam experiment [10]. However, due to our
high-resolution approach in a cold gas, we detect these
eﬀects at densities four orders of magnitude lower.

The line broadening is accompanied by an excitation
suppression on resonance. At maximum excitation rate
and density, we detect only 5000 Rydberg atoms on reso-
nance, which is a factor of ∼ 4 lower than expected from
simple linear density and excitation intensity scaling. To
further clarify this point, we have plotted the number of
Rydberg atoms excited on resonance versus the scaled
5P3/2 density in Fig. 2(b). If no interaction was present
and the transition is not saturated, we expect the num-
bers of Rydberg atoms to scale as NRyd ∝ n5P I (n∗)−3,
with I being the intensity of the excitation laser and n∗
the main quantum number corrected by the correspond-
ing quantum defect [1]. Therefore we connect the low
and high intensity data by introducing an intensity-scaled
density ˜n5P = n5P I/Ihigh. As can be seen in Fig. 2(b)
both data sets can be smoothly connected by a heuris-
tic saturation function for the number of Rydberg atoms
˜n5P/nsat
of the form NRyd = N0
1+˜n5P/nsat . A ﬁt to the data
yields N0 = 6700 atoms and nsat = 0.6 × 109 cm−3. We
have carefully ruled out saturation of our MCP detector,
and thus attribute the saturation of the Rydberg exci-
tation to interatomic interactions leading to the onset of

a dipole blockade [13, 14].
In contrast to the original
proposal based on resonant dipole-dipole interaction, the
blockade is caused by vdW interaction in our case.

To further test this interpretation we have compared
the saturation for diﬀerent main quantum numbers n.
As the vdW interaction potential between two Ryd-
berg atoms scales with n11, one expects much weaker
saturation for lines with lower main quantum num-
ber, although the transition strength of these line is
much stronger. Fig. 2(c) shows a comparison of res-
onantly excited Rydberg atoms on the 82S1/2 and the
62S1/2 line. While the data for the 82S1/2 excitation
are identical to Fig. 2(b), the 5P3/2 density for the
62S1/2 excitation is scaled as previously described: ˜n5P =
n5P (I62S/I82S) (n∗
62S)3. The solid lines show a ﬁt
with the same saturation function as described above.
Within the experimental uncertainties and the ﬁtting ac-
curacy, both saturation curves yield the same slope at
small values of the scaled density ˜n5P, while the satu-
ration density of the 62S1/2 line is larger by a factor of
4 than the saturation density of the 82S1/2 line. Ac-
cordingly, the asymptotic number of Rydberg atoms for
inﬁnite density diﬀers by a factor of 3. Similar results are
obtained by comparing excitations to 80D and 60D lev-
els. Although we are currently lacking a detailed model
to describe the observed line shapes, all our ﬁndings qual-
itatively conﬁrm the interpretation of a vdW blockade as
the cause of the density dependent saturation.

82S/n∗

The density dependence of the dipole-forbidden ﬁne
structure doublet 81P1/2 (left peak) and 81P3/2 (right
peak) is depicted in Fig. 3(a). The graphs (a1) to (a3) are
taken at 5P3/2 densities of 0.3×109 cm−3, 0.7×109 cm−3,
and 1.9 × 109 cm−3, respectively. Two features are re-
markable: With increasing density the 81P3/2 peak de-
velops a wing on the red side of the resonance, while the
81P1/2 peak is hardly broadened, but grows much faster
with density. The diﬀerent broadening of the lines can be
explained by the diﬀerent vdW potentials experienced by
the two ﬁne structure components. In contrast to the S
and D lines, theoretical predictions of the pair potentials
are available [17, 18]. In Fig. 3(b) the attractive asymp-
totes of the vdW potentials are plotted versus the mean
internuclear distance of atoms in the 5P3/2 state. We
have extracted the interaction potential from the spec-
tral line broadening of the red wings by subtracting the
line width at low density from the observed widths of the
red wing. Assuming a two-photon pair excitation from a
5P3/2 + 5P3/2 pair to be responsible for the line broad-
ening [10], the resulting frequency width is multiplied by
a factor of two. The data nicely ﬁt the predicted inter-
action potentials for a maximum 5P3/2 density of about
2 × 109 cm−3 consistent with the experimental value.

5P

In contrast to the dipole-allowed S and D lines, the
dipole- forbidden 81P1/2 and 81P3/2 peaks grow much
faster than linear with 5P3/2 density, as shown in
Fig. 3(c). A ﬁt to the data of the 81P1/2 resonance yields
a scaling with n2.0(1)
. The behavior of the 81P3/2 peak
is more complicated, but shows saturation relative to the
81P1/2 peak, which may again be caused by a similar
interaction-induced blockade eﬀect as discussed above.
Whether the density dependence of the dipole forbidden
P lines may be attributed to interaction-induced S- and
D-admixtures has to be clariﬁed in the framework of a
detailed model for the cw Rydberg excitation in a cold
gas which is under development.

In conclusion, we have explored signatures of a strongly
interacting, cold Rydberg gas, revealing measurable ef-
fects over interatomic distances as large as 100,000 Bohr
radii. The interaction shows up in two distinct eﬀects:
A broadening of resonance lines by the pair-interaction

vdW potential, and a suppression of on-resonance exci-
tation. We ﬁnd good agreement between the observed
broadening with predicted interaction potentials in the
case of the 81P ﬁne-structure doublett. Theoretical cal-
culations of the S- and D-interaction potentials are un-
derway, which will allow for a more quantitative descrip-
tion of the observed line shapes. Thus the high spec-
troscopic resolution that we achieve constitutes a precise
direct determination of long-range interaction potentials.
The saturation of Rydberg excitation with increasing
density constitutes a complementary signature of the ul-
tra long-range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and marks
the onset of a vdW-induced dipole blockade.

While the spectral broadening of the resonance lines
can only be understood as an “instantaneous” excitation
of Rydberg pairs, it remains to be clariﬁed whether the
density-dependent saturation occurs in a similar way or
whether it is induced by an avalanche-like process based
on the successive creation of Rydberg atoms. The latter
hypothesis has successfully been employed in the inter-
pretation of similar saturation eﬀects recently observed
for Rydberg atoms excited through short duration, high
intensity laser pulses from a cold gas [14]. Our unique
spectroscopic resolution provides important experimental
information to further elucidate the processes underlying
the dipole blockade. Our experimental approach employ-
ing narrow-band cw Rydberg excitation can directly be
applied to the implementation of quantum information
processing with Rydberg atoms [13, 19] by further in-
creasing the density, thus proceeding from the two-body
limit to the full many-body regime of the dipole blockade.

We present an ab initio method of calculation of isotope shift in atoms with a few valence electrons,
based on the conﬁguration-interaction calculation of energy. The main motivation for developing the
method comes from the need to analyze whether diﬀerences in isotope abundance in early universe
can contribute to the observed anomalies in quasar absorption spectra. The current best explanation
for these anomalies is the assumption that the ﬁne structure constant α was smaller at early epoch.
We show that we can calculate the isotope shift in magnesium with good accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

II. METHOD

The motivation for this work comes from recent stud-
ies of quasar absorption spectra that reveal a possible
change in α since the early universe [1]. One of the pos-
sible major sources of systematic eﬀects in these studies
is that the isotopic abundance ratios in gas clouds in the
early universe could be very diﬀerent to those on Earth.
A “conspiracy” of several isotopic abundances may pro-
vide an alternative explanation for the observed variation
in spectra [2]. In order to test this possibility it is nec-
essary to have accurate values for the isotope shift (IS)
for the relevant atomic transitions. Experimental data is
available for only a very few of them; therefore, accurate
calculations are needed to make the most comprehensive
analysis possible.

Previously we have calculated isotope shift in atoms
with one valence electron [3]. This work represents a ﬁrst
step in developing a method for the calculation of isotope
shift in atoms with more than one valence electron. The
method used here is similar to our previous calculations
of the α-dependence of transition frequences for ions with
several valence electrons [4]. It includes Dirac-Fock cal-
culation of the core and conﬁguration interaction (CI) for
the valence electrons in combination with the ﬁnite-ﬁeld
method for the perturbation. Magnesium is one of the
simplest and well studied two-electron atoms. Because of
that it is often used as a test ground for diﬀerent methods
of atomic calculations. In this paper we show that we can
calculate the isotope shift of some magnesium transitions
for which experimental values are available.

The isotope shifts of atomic transition frequencies
come from two sources:
the ﬁnite size of the nu-
clear charge distribution (the “volume” or “ﬁeld” shift),
[5]).
and the ﬁnite mass of the nucleus (see, e.g.
is
The energy shift due to recoil of
(1/2M )p2
N = (1/2M )(Σpi)2. Furthermore this “mass
shift” is traditionally divided into the normal mass shift
(NMS) and the speciﬁc mass shift (SMS). The normal
mass shift is given by the operator (1/2M )Σp2
i , which
is easily calculated from the transition frequency. The
SMS operator is (1/M )Σi<j(pi · pj) which is diﬃcult to
evaluate accurately.

and hr2i is the mean square nuclear radius. The value
1823 refers to the ratio of the atomic mass unit to the
electron mass.

In this paper we develop a method for calculating the
speciﬁc mass shift kSMS for atoms with several valence
electrons. It is worth noting that in this paper we use
the convention δνA

,A = νA

− νA.

Following our previous work on single valence electron
atoms (Ref. [3]) we are looking for an “all order” method
of calculation. Again we have found that the ﬁnite-ﬁeld
scaling method is very useful in this respect. The rescaled

SMS operator is added to the many-particle Hamiltonian

Hλ = H0 + λHSMS = H0 + λ

pi · pj.

Xi<j

The eigenvalue problem for the new Hamiltonian is solved
for various λ, and then we recover the speciﬁc mass shift
constant as

kSMS = lim
λ→0

dE
dλ

.

(4)

The operator (3) has the same symmetry and structure as
the initial Hamiltonian H0 (see the Appendix, Ref. [3]).
In this work we restrict ourselves to the frozen-core
approximation. We ﬁrst solve the Dirac-Fock equations
for the core and valence electrons. Then we generate
a basis set that includes the core and valence orbitals
and a number of virtual orbitals. Finally we do the full
conﬁguration interaction calculation.

The SMS operator for the valence electrons in the
frozen core approximation can be divided into the core,
one-electron and two-electron parts:

SMS + H (2)

HSMS = H (0)

SMS + H (1)
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (5) corresponds to the change of
the core potential. It accounts for the change of the core
orbitals when the Dirac-Fock equations are solved for the
operator Hλ. The term H (1)
SMS accounts for the exchange
interaction of the valence electrons with the core:

(5)

SMS

hi|H (1)

SMS|ki =

hi, j|p1 · p2|j, ki.

(6)

Ncore

Xj=1

The last term corresponds to the speciﬁc mass shift be-
tween the two valence electrons, p1 · p2.

III. CALCULATION AND RESULTS

We are using the Dirac-Fock code [6], which was mod-
iﬁed for the Hamiltonian (3). The CI calculations are
made with the help of the modiﬁcation [7] of the code
[8]. In order to study the role of the valence correlations
we made three diﬀerent calculations:

1. The basic one-conﬁgurational calculation for the
ground state 1S0[3s2] and for the 1,3PJ [3s3p] states.
All core orbitals and orbitals 3s and 3p are formed
in the V N −2 approximation (i.e. by solving Dirac-
Fock equations for the core).

2. Full two-electron CI for the medium size basis set
[8sp5d], which includes the orbitals 1−8s1/2, 2−8pj
and 3−5dj. The 3s, 3p and 3d orbitals are solutions
of the V N −2 Dirac-Fock potential. The remaining
virtual orbitals are constructed by multiplying the
previous orbital of the same partial wave by the
simple radial function and orthogonalizing with the
other orbitals [9].

3. Full two-electron CI for the basis set [12spd9f ].
This basis set is formed by diagonalizing the Dirac-
Fock operator on the basis set of B-splines and ex-
cluding orbitals with high energy (for a description
of this method as applied in atomic physics, see e.g.
Ref. [10]).

Below we refer to these calculations as small, medium,
and large. The large calculation is already very close to
the saturation of the valence CI. Here the diﬀerence be-
tween the theoretical spectrum and experiment is mostly
caused by the neglect of the core-valence correlations.
The latter were studied, for example, in Ref. [11]. For
Mg I the typical corrections to the valence energies and
transition frequencies were found to be of the order of a
few percent.

Table I presents the resulting SMS level shift constants,
kSMS of Eq. (1), in diﬀerent approximations. The contri-
butions of individual terms in Eq. (5) are given, as well
as their sum. It is interesting to note that all of the terms
are large in comparison to the total SMS. There is a large
cancellation between contributions within levels, and also
between diﬀerent levels. This shows that very high accu-
racy is required in order to preserve the remaining SMS
in transitions.

Comparison of the diﬀerent approximations shows a
strong dependence on the size of the basis sets. We see
that it is very important to saturate the basis as com-

pletely as possible. In some cases the SMS changes dras-
tically even between the medium and the large basis sets.
In particular, the diﬀerence between large and medium
SMS calculation for the level 3D1(3s3d) is 39%. That is
mostly due to the f -wave contribution, which is absent
in the medium basis set. Note that the SMS operator
can only mix orbitals with ∆l = 1. That is why the f -
wave contribution is more important for the levels of the
conﬁguration 3s3d. On the other hand, for the same rea-
son, the contribution of the higher partial waves to the
considered levels is suppressed.

Analysis of Table I shows that valence correlations tend
to decrease the contributions of the ﬁrst two terms of
the SMS operator. The third (two-particle) term of the
SMS operator is generally not screened. On the contrary,
for some levels the two particle contribution grows with
the size of the basis set. Note that the ﬁnal value of
the two-particle contribution to the ground state SMS
is of the same order as the other contributions, as it is
for most other states, while in the one-conﬁgurational
approximation it is zero.

In Table II we compare the results of our calculation
with experiment for SMS in transitions between 26Mg
and 24Mg. Also presented for comparison are the results
of Veseth (Ref. [12]). That paper used non-relativistic
many-body perturbation theory within the algebraic ap-
proximation to calculate the isotope shift to third order
for some transitions.

We have also applied the ﬁnite-ﬁeld scaling method to
calculate the ﬁeld shift in Mg. By following the deﬁni-
tions for ﬁeld shift given in Ref. [3], and using the same
approximations for the CI calculation, we found that it
was less than 2% of the normal mass shift for all relevant
transitions. The ﬁeld shift is smaller than omissions in
the mass shift calculation, notably the core-valence cor-
relations; thus for simplicity we have neglected the ﬁeld
shift from our analysis in this paper.

Core-valence correlations have been studied for the
one-electron atoms in Ref. [3, 13] and shown to be quite
noticeable. They can explain the diﬀerence between our
calculations and the experiment in Table II. Core-valence
correlations are usually more important for the ground
state than for excited states. That may be the reason
why the largest discrepancy with the experiment is for

3

the transitions from the ground state.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have presented a method for the calculation of
the isotope-shift in many-electron atoms using the CI
for the valence electrons in combination with the ﬁnite-
ﬁeld method, and tested the method in magnesium. The
agreement was found to be quite good for all transitions.
Even for the transitions from the ground state 1S0 to the
J = 1 levels of the conﬁguration 3s3p, where the error is
largest, it constitutes about 20% of the total IS. In par-
ticular, for the purposes of resolving systematic errors in
the search for α-variation (Ref. [1, 2]), such accuracy is
high enough.

Further work on magnesium could include core-
correlations, using the extensions to CI outlined in
Ref. [7]. We have decided not to do this, however, be-
cause we wanted a general method for calculating IS in
many electron atoms. The method of including core-
valence correlations in the valence CI with the help of the
eﬀective Hamiltonian has proven to be very eﬀective for
atoms with two or three valence electrons, but becomes
less reliable for atoms with more than three valence elec-
trons. Unfortunately, most of the ions of astrophysical
interest have many electrons in the open shells. For such
ions valence correlations are the most important ones and
we plan to use this technique to calculate isotope shift for
the transitions that were used to detect variation of α.
That will provide stringent limits on the size of the sys-
tematic error due to variation in isotope abundance.

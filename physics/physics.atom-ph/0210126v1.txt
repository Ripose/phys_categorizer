Abstract

Hyperspherical partial wave theory has been applied here in a new way in the cal-
culation of the triple diﬀerential cross sections for the ionization of hydrogen atoms
by electron impact at low energies for various equal-energy-sharing kinematic con-
ditions. The agreement of the cross section results with the absolute measurements
of R¨oder et al [48] for diﬀerent kinematic conditions at 17.6 eV is very encouraging.
The other calculated results, for relatively higher energies, are also generally satis-
factory, particularly for large Θab geometries. In view of the present results, together
with the fact that it is capable of describing unequal-energy-sharing kinematics [35],
it may be said that the hyperspherical partial wave theory is quite appropriate for
the description of ionization events of electron-hydrogen type systems. It is also clear
that the present approach in the implementation of the hyperspherical partial wave
theory is very appropriate.

INTRODUCTION

In the study of electron hydrogen atom ionization collision, the simplest three-body
ionization problem in atomic physics, there are many attempts for a complete solution
but all of these face tremendous diﬃculties and have only limited success. Except for one
or two attempts all use time-independent framework. For accurate information regarding
scattering events, one may solve accurately the Schr¨odinger equation for the scattering
states Ψ(+)

Ionization amplitudes may then be obtained either from the ﬂux condition at inﬁnity

or from appropriate projections. In the literature both Ψ(+)
used. There are a large number of attempts which strives to solve for Ψ(+)
. Among these
the most successful attempts are the various close-coupling calculations [2-4]. In these
calculations Ψ(+)
are expanded in terms of basis functions and ionization information
are extracted from a solution of the unknown expansion functions. Another possibility
is to expand Ψ(+)
in terms of a complete set of functions in the angular variables. In
these regards the attempts of Kato and Watanabe [5, 6] are remarkable. They used
hyperspherical co-ordinates and expanded Ψ(+)
in terms of hyper-radius dependent an-
i
gular functions. Matching with a wave function, which satisﬁes an approximately correct
boundary condition, they obtained with remarkable success, the total ionization cross
sections down to the threshold. However, diﬀerential cross section results of this the-
ory are not known. Very recently Rescigno and associates made [7, 8] a breakthrough
calculation and reproduced for equal energy-sharing and constant angular separation
Θab of the outgoing electrons, the cross section results, at low energies, with surprising
success.
in terms of spherical harmonics in
four angular variables. Then they converted the resultant diﬀerential equations for the
radial functions, in two radial variables, into a set of diﬀerence equations over a large
network in the radial variables-plane. They used a novel technique. Using a complex
scaling procedure they converted the scattering problem as if into a bound state prob-
lem. Then they solved a huge set (several million) of linear equations using very special
techniques. Ultimately they obtained ionization amplitudes using the ﬂux condition.
Later [9] they conﬁrmed their results using projection technique. Although the ECS ap-
proach reproduced the equal-energy-sharing, constant-Θab results perfectly well, results
of this approach for unequal-energy-sharing kinematics are not known. There are also
large number of attempts of using Ψ(

Brauner, Briggs and Klar [10] and later Berakdar [11] and Berakdar et al [12, 13] made
use of this approach. They used Ψ(
f which are asymptotically correct (or nearly so)
−
but are unlikely to be correct at ﬁnite distances. As a consequence results of these
calculations are only moderately accurate. Moreover there are no systematic tractable
way of improving the results.

)

An alternative approach for determining the electron atom collision cross sections
is to solve a coupled set of integral equations for the oﬀ-shell T-matrix elements. Das
and associates [14-16] have used this approach in the study of various electron hydrogen
atom and electron helium atom scattering problems by solving the resultant equations
in a rather crude manner. However, they always obtained moderately good results.
There are also attempts [17-24] to improve the calculations. Along these lines the most
successful calculations are the convergent close coupling (CCC) calculations of Bray et
al [25-27]. In many contexts they applied the CCC method with surprising success. In
the ionization calculations it is found to have several diﬃculties also [26, 28, 29].

Another promising approach for the electron hydrogen atom ionization problem is
the hyperspherical partial wave approach [30-31]. Details of this approach are given in
[31]. In section II we also present important features of this approach. Earlier with an
additional approximation of neglecting the coupling eﬀects, some results were obtained
[32-33] which are qualitatively not very bad. Recently this approach has been used
[34-35] retaining fully the coupling eﬀects. In solving the relevant coupled set of radial
wave equations over an initial interval [0, ∆], R-matrix [36] approach had been used.
Although the results were always found to be of the correct magnitude pseudo-resonance
type behaviour gives much troubles in extracting correct cross section results. To avoid
this problem we use a new approach. This appears to be very successful and leads to
very interesting results both for equal-energy-sharing constant-Θab kinematics, equal-
energy-sharing asymmetric kinematics, and also for unequal-energy-sharing kinematics
[35]. Thus it appears that hyperspherical partial wave theory is quite appropriate for the
study of ionization problems of electron-hydrogen type systems.

Most recently two very broad-based theories have been proposed. One of these is the
time-dependent close coupling theory [37] and the other is the hyperspherical R-matrix
theory [38]. Positions of these theories are not yet very clear.

II. HYPERSPHERICAL PARTIAL WAVE THEORY

In the hyperspherical partial wave theory one uses the time-independent framework.
In the time-independent framework the T-matrix element is given by expression (2) or
alternatively by

Φf |

In these expressions Φi and Φf are the unperturbed initial and ﬁnal channel wave func-
tions, satisfying certain exact boundary condition at inﬁnity and that the Vi and Vf

are the corresponding perturbation potentials. For the case of ionization of hydrogen
atoms expression (2) is more appropriate for use, since in this case asymptotically cor-
rect Φi is easily available. Many use expression (3), including ECS [9] by projection
method, but inappropriately, since the corresponding Φf ’s they use do not satisfy the
correct boundary condition. In the hyperspherical partial wave theory Ψ(
is expanded
−
f
in terms of hyperspherical harmonics, which are functions of ﬁve angular variables. The
corresponding radial waves are functions of one radial variable, the hyper radius R only.
This proves to be advantageous in numerical computations, since then the ﬁve angular
variables range over a bounded compact domain, while only one variable R ranges over a
semi-inﬁnite domain [0,
). It may be noted here that so far nobody could take account
of the exact boundary condition in the asymptotic domain for the accurate solution of
Ψ(
. Here we aspire to take account the exact boundary condition at inﬁnity, in the

f
limit. This is the most novel feature in the hyperspherical partial wave theory. Here we

B. Solution over a ﬁnite domain

Here we consider the solution of equations (8) over a ﬁnite domain [0, R0]. Away from
the origin, solution of the equations is easy. A Taylors series expansion method suﬃces
for getting arbitrarily accurate solutions. The main diﬃculty is in starting the solution
from the origin. Near origin the equations have analytic solutions ( Fock [40] )but these
are too complicated to be useful in numerical computations. In our earlier calculations
[34-35] we used R-matrix approach for getting solutions over an initial interval [0, ∆]
(with ∆ suitably chosen). But this approach faces troubles as pseudo-resonance type
behavior appears giving much troubles in determining appropriate solutions. To avoid
such diﬃculties we consider here a new approach. For the interval [0, ∆] we consider a
boundary value problem . The solution vector f (k)
0 (R) is assumed to have a value 0 at
Nmx identity matrix at R = ∆. We divide
the origin and the k-th column of the Nmx ×
the interval [0, ∆] into m subintervals and use a ﬁve-point diﬀerence formula

The resultant linear set of equations ultimately take the form

SY(k) = b,

where S is a sparse matrix. We solve these equations by the biconjugate gradient method
[41] using routines given in [42]. With a suitable choice of a preconditioner the iterations
smoothly converge (with a few hundred iterations or even less) to ﬁve or six decimal
places for a suitable choice of error limit (say, 1 in 107 parts). In this way Nmx solution
vectors f (k)
are determined over [0, ∆]. The solutions are next continued over [∆, R0]
by Taylors expansion method with stabilisation [43] after suitable steps, giving solution
vectors f (k)

over [0, R0].

2Nmx of the 3Nmx unknown coeﬃcients are now determined by matching values (and
ﬁrst order derivatives) of the two sets of solutions at a point R0 where all the solutions
are valid. The remaining Nmx unknown coeﬃcients are then determined from the de-
mand that Ψ(
f s actually satisﬁes the appropriate boundary condition. To facilitate the

computations we ﬁrst deﬁne the K-matrix through the relation

where B is some unknown constant matrix. (The K-matrix thus deﬁned is a little diﬀerent
from the one usually deﬁned. But in any case it should be symmetric.). The K-matrix

Finally fph is completely determined once the vector c is determined. Now c is deter-

III. PRESENT CALCULATION

In our present calculation for the equal-energy-sharing constant - Θab kinematic condi-
tions,where Θab is the angular separation of the outgoing electrons, there are two impor-
tant parameters ∆ and R0 which are needed to be judiciously chosen. The parameter ∆

8

of the initial interval [0,∆], for a solution of the radial equations (8), has been chosen to
be 5 a.u. for all the energies considered here. The results do not depend on ∆ for small
variations (of a few a.u.) about this value. On the other hand the choice of the param-
eter R0 ,the asymptotic range parameter,is very crucial. Without its appropriate choice
the asymptotic series solutions (10) and (11) are unlikely to converge. Here it is found
1
that for convergent asymptotic series solutions R0 is needed to be such that R0 ∼
,
√E
where E is the energy in the ﬁnal channel. Thus for energies of 30 eV, 25 eV, 19.6 eV,
17.6 eV ,and 15.6 eV this range parameter R0 may be chosen greater than the values
60 a.u., 70 a.u., 90 a.u., 120 a.u. and 150 a.u. respectively. We have chosen R0 around
these values in our calculations. However for the computation of single diﬀerential cross
section (SDCS) it is necessary for converged results to vary R0, and extrapolate, as in
.Our limited computational resources restrict us to take
ECS calculation [8] for R0 → ∞
single R0 value for each energy.Moreover for arbitrary large R0 unwanted errors are likely
to make the results erroneous. So some optimum choice of R0 has to be made for each
energy with a few trials.
In our present computations this has been done. Next we
consider the choice of L values for inclusion in the calculations for diﬀerent energies. For
15.6 eV energy, values of L upto 5 proved suﬃcient. For 17.6 eV calculations values of
L upto 7 are found to be necessary. For the other energies ,considered here, values of L
upto 9 have been included. For ﬁxed (L, S, π) the number of channels, the number of
states with diﬀerent (l1, l2, n) triplets, which have been included, were chosen suitably
for fairly converged results. In any case for ﬁxed (l1, l2) pairs n was varied from 0 to 9.
In this way convergence with respect to n is obtained. The number of (l1, l2) pairs, which
have been included, are somewhat less for L
2 compared to those in the ECS calcu-
lation . These pairs are chosen more or less in the order as in ECS calculations (a little
diﬀerent from those of hyperspherical calculations of Kato and Watanabe [6]). However
there could be some better choice. For lower energies convergence with respect to the
increase in channel size is rather smooth. It is not so for relatively higher energies of 25
eV or 30 eV. Nevertheless we have obtained nearly converged results in the cases consid-
ered. All the results presented here are more or less based on 50 channels calculations.
Most of the calculations, reported here, were done on Pentium -III PCs. Calculations
for 15.6 eV energy could not be done on PCs. Thus the results for 15.6 eV and 17.6
eV, which are presented here, have been derived from calculations on a SUN server. It
may be further added here that for 15.6 eV the SDCS results show that for equal energy
sharing case the calculated SDCS value is about twice the expected value, although the
calculated total cross section appears correct (see table I). This is unacceptable. In any
case the various cross section results for this energy have been multiplied by a factor
0.5 before presentation in the ﬁgures. For other energies, however, we have nearly the
correct SDCS values for equal energy sharing situations. Calculation on a larger scale
with larger values of R0, and with more precise solution of the equations (17), may decide
absolutely the normalization question of the measured results of R¨oder et al[45] for 15.6

≥

9

eV energy. Cross section results for 15.6 eV energy have been included here for the sake
of completeness.

IV. RESULTS

A. Triple Diﬀerential Cross Section for Constant ΘabGeometry

The triple diﬀerential cross section results for equal-energy-sharing constant Θab ge-
ometries are presented in ﬁgures 1(a) for 15.6 eV energy, in ﬁgure 2(a) for 17.6 eV energy
and in ﬁgures 3,4 and 5 for energies of 19.6 eV, 25 eV and 30 eV. In these ﬁgures we have
presented the theoretical results of CCC calculations [26,46] and of ECS calculations
[8,47]. Here we have also included the absolute measured values of R¨oder et al[44,45] for
15.6 eV and the most recent re-measured (with necessary inter-normalization) values of
R¨oder et al[48] for 17.6 eV energy. For other energies the measured results [44] are only
relative and are normalized as in [9]. Our results are generally comparable with the ECS
results in magnitude. For 17.6 eV our present results appear most interesting. These
are even somewhat better compared to the ECS results for Θab = 1500 and 1800. For
these values of Θab, the 15.6 eV results also appear good , particularly in shapes, but
conﬁrmation by larger scale calculation is necessary. The 19.6 eV results also appear to
be very good. For other energies our results appear less satisfactory in comparison with
the ECS results, but are generally comparable with the CCC results.

B. Triple Diﬀerential Cross Sections for Fixed θa Geometry

In ﬁgures 1(b) and 2(b) we have compared our results for equal-energy-sharing asym-
metric geometries with absolute measured values of R¨oder et al[45] for 15.6 eV and R¨oder
et al[48] for 17.6 eV, in which one of the outgoing electrons is observed in a ﬁxed direc-
tion while that of the other one is varied. In these cases we again compare our results
with the calculated results of ECS and CCC theories. Here our results also appear to be
quite good, particularly for 17.6 eV in view of the most recent measurements. For θa =
30o at 15.6 eV, the peak position of our calculated curves are little shifted to the right.

−
Otherwise all the results of the present calculation appear satisfactory.

C. Triple Diﬀerential Cross Sections for Symmetric Geometry

In ﬁgures 1(c) and 2(c) we have presented TDCS results for symmetric appearance of the
two outgoing electrons relative to the incident electron direction, for 15.6 eV and 17.6
eV incident electron energies, for which their are again absolute measured results [45,48].
For 15.6 eV energy our results agree qualitatively with the experimental results. Here a
70-channel calculation has been found to be necessary. For 17.6 eV our results do not
appear very good. For 15.6 eV energy both the ECS and CCC theories underestimate

10

the cross section results considerably. For 17.6 eV energy, however, the ECS theory gives
the best overall representation.

D. Integrated Cross Sections and the Spin Asymmetry Parameter

The parabolic ﬁtted curves to our computed single diﬀerential cross sections data are
generally close to the ECS extrapolated curves but our raw data which could be calcu-
lated, as in ECS ﬂux method, only away from the two ends of the energy intervals widely
diﬀer from ECS or CCC (wherever available) curves. However, the computed total in-
tegrated cross sections, with suitable extrapolation from these are generally good. Here
in table I we have presented values of integrated cross sections σI = (σs + 3σt)/4 and
σt)/(σs + 3σt) where σs and σt are the singlet
the spin asymmetry parameter A = (σs −
and the triplet cross sections, together with values of ECS theory by ﬂux approach [8]
and those of CCC theory and the experimental values . The integrated cross sections
agree with the experimentally measured values of Shah et al[49] within about 20% . The
spin asymmetry parameter A agrees, however, excellently with the measurements [50,51].

Next we note down the shortcomings and diﬃculties associated with the present ap-
proach. The ﬁrst point to note is that it may not be possible in this approach to get
reliable cross section results for extreme asymmetry, as in ECS ﬂux approach, for one of
the outgoing electrons sharing very small energy values compared to the other. ’Contam-
ination with high Rydberg states’,as in ECS calculation [8] gives wrong results for ﬁnite
values of R0 in such cases. Extrapolation to R0 =
may only lead to reliable results
in those cases. This may require larger computational resources. Another diﬃculty to
be noted is the appearance of a few large eigen-values of the charge matrix for large-
channel calculations. In such cases computational strategies are needed to be reviewed.
In our calculations this has occurred in a few cases. In such cases we simply cut-short
in magnitude these one or two large eigen values to the neighboring ones. However a
better approach may be necessary to tackle such problems. No other diﬃculties appear
worth mentioning. For a fully converged results inclusion of more channels (about 100
or a little more) may be required with appropriate choice of (l1, l2) pairs (say, as in ECS
calculation) and with further stabilization. However these are subjects of further studies
requiring more computational resources and time.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The results of the present calculation fairly display the capability of the hyperspherical
partial wave theory in representing results for equal-energy-sharing kinematical condi-
tions at low energies. The new approach that has been used in the implementation of the
hyperspherical partial wave theory appears very appropriate. The computed cross section
results are observed to be very satisfactory. If one recalls the capability of the theory to

11

describe the ionization collisions for unequal-energy-sharing asymmetric kinematic con-
ditions (as indicated in [35]) also then the capability of the hyperspherical partial wave
theory towards a complete description of the electron - hydrogen - atom ionization prob-
lem is amply demonstrated. Considering the computational facilities used (Pentium - III
PCs and a SUN Enterpriser 450 server) success of the present calculation is appreciable.
For fully converged results better computational facilities may be required. The theory
may easily be applied in the study of ionization of hydrogen-like ions with a little change
in the deﬁnition of the wave function Φi and the interaction potential Vi. The theory may
also be extended for application to the double-ionization of helium atom or helium-like
ions or to other multi electron ionization processes.

TABLE

Table I. Total integrated ionization cross sections (a.u.) and the spin asymmetry
parameter. The experimental values of cross sections are those of Shah et al [49] (the
starred numbers are from extrapolation). ECS results are from [8] and the CCC results
are from [4]. In the experimental results of the asymmetry parameter of Crowe et al [50]
and Fletcher et al [51] presented here, the numbers with superscript + or
denote the
available result just a little above or below the energy considered (for the exact energy
values the corresponding references are to be seen). For 15.6 eV energy,ECS results of
earlier calculation [8] are not available. So for this energy we present results from [9] and
indicate it so in the table.

Abstract

We presented an alternative computational method for determining the permitted
LS spectral terms arising from lN electronic conﬁgurations. This method makes the
direct calculation of LS terms possible. Using only basic algebra, we derived our
theory from LS-coupling scheme and Pauli exclusion principle. As an application,
we have performed the most complete set of calculations to date of the spectral
terms arising from lN electronic conﬁgurations, and the representative results were
shown. 1 As another application on deducing LS-coupling rules, for two equivalent
electrons, we deduced the famous Even Rule; for three equivalent electrons, we
derived a new simple rule.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the atomic and nuclear shell model, a basic but often laborious and com-
plicated problem is to calculate the spectral terms arising from many-particle
conﬁgurations. For a N-particle occupied subshell lN , currently we often use
computational methods based on the unitary-group representation theory,

1 The table of LS terms for lN (l = 0–5) conﬁgurations is too long and over two
pages, so we only present part of the result in this article.

which have been developed by Gelfand et al. [1], M. Moshinsky et al. [2],
Biedenharn et al. [3], Judd [4], Louck et al. [5], Drake et al. [6], Harter et al. [7],
Paldus [8], Braunschweig et al. [10], Kent et al. [11] and others, extending thus
the classical works of Weyl [12], Racah [13], S. Meshkov [14], Cartan, Casimir,
Killing, and others. For eﬀorts of all these works, can we have the current cal-
culation method much more simpliﬁed and less steps needed than ever before.
However, when many electrons with higher orbital angular momentum are in-
volved in one subshell, the calculation process using this theoretical method
still is a challenging work. The current feasible methods usually take several
steps of simpliﬁcation, such as ﬁrstly using Branching Rules for reduction [10],
and then using LL-coupling scheme. Nevertheless, we still have to work hard
to calculate a big table of the LS terms corresponding to Young Patterns of
one column (the situation is similar to use Gelfand basis set [7,8,9]), and many
LL-couplings. Often this is a diﬃcult and complicated job.

In this paper, we present an alternative mathematical technique for direct
determination of spectral terms for lN conﬁgurations. The new theory consists
of a main formula [equation (1)] and four complete sub-formulas [equations (2)-
(5)], all of which are common algebra expressions. The basis of this method
does not require any knowledge of group theory or other senior mathematics.

The organization of this paper is as follows: the ﬁve basic formulas and some
notations are introduced in Section II (the derivations of those formulas are
presented in Appendix). The speciﬁc calculation procedure is shown in Sec-
tion III. In Section VI, as some applications using this alternative theory, we
presented permitted spectral terms for several lN conﬁgurations; then deduced
naturally the well-known Even Rule for two electrons; and for three electrons,
we derived a new compact rule. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.

2 THEORETICAL OUTLINE AND NOTATIONS

2.1 Notations

In the following, we denote by X(N, l, S′, L) the number of spectral terms with
total orbital angular quantum number L and total spin quantum number S′/2
arising from lN electronic conﬁgurations. (To calculate and express more con-
cisely, we doubled the total spin quantum number S and the spin magnetic
quantum number MS here, which are correspondingly denoted by S′ and M ′
S.
Hence, all discussions in the following are based on integers.) When the func-
tion X(N, l, S′, L) = 0, it means that there is no spectral terms with total
orbital angular quantum number L and spin quantum number S′/2. We de-
note by A(N, l, lb, M ′
S, ML) the number of LS terms having allowable orbital

2

magnetic quantum number ML and spin magnetic quantum number M ′
S/2,
arising from lN electronic conﬁgurations. lb is deﬁned as the largest allowable
orbital magnetic quantum number (mli)max in one class. Its initial value equals
l according to equation (1).

2.2 The Complete Basic Formulas

The main formula to calculate the number of LS terms in lN electronic con-
ﬁgurations is given below,

X(N, l, S′, L) = A(N, l, l, S′, L) − A(N, l, l, S′, L + 1)

+ A(N, l, l, S′ + 2, L + 1) − A(N, l, l, S′ + 2, L),

(1)

where the value of function A is based on the following four sub-formulas

Case 1 : M ′
A(1, l, lb, 1, ML) = 1

S = 1, |ML| ≤ l, and N = 1

Case 2 :

which is based on the following four
sub-formulas that depend on cases

Case 1: N=1, {MS'}={1}, |ML|(cid:1)l

Case 4: other cases

Equation (2)

Equation (5)

Case 3: N>1, {MS'}={N},|ML|(cid:1)f(N-1)

2 −⌊ N

2 ⌋, . . . , N

if N is larger than (2l + 1) and less than (4l + 2), it is equivalent to the case of
(4l+2−N) electrons; Else if N is not larger than 2l+1, the total spin quantum
number S could be { N
2 +1−⌊ N
2 } [equations (C.22, D.1)], and
the total orbital angular quantum number L could be {0, 1, . . . , f ( N −M ′
2 −1)+
f ( N +M ′
2 − 1)} [equation (C.17)]. The number of LS terms with total orbital
angular quantum number L and total spin quantum number S (S = S′/2) is
calculated by function X(N, l, S′, L). Based on equation (1), then the main
task is to calculate the function A(N, l, lb, M ′
S, ML). Due to the value of three
parameters N, M ′
S, and ML in function A, there are four cases. If it is in the
condition of case 2 or case 3, we can calculate the function A based on the
equation (3) or equation (4), both of which could come down to case 1 or case
3. Finally, we will get the eigenvalue of function X. If the function X vanishes,
it means that there is no corresponding LS terms.

4 EXAMPLES and APPLICATIONS

4.1 Permitted LS terms of lN subshell

Based on the ﬂow chart shown in Figure 1, we have written a computer pro-
gram in C language. For the length limit of this article, we only presented in
Table 1 the LS terms for g9 and h11 electronic conﬁgurations. (The terms for
sN , pN , dN , and f N can be found in Robert D. Cowan’s textbook [15, p. 110].)
As far as we know, LS spectral terms of gN and hN given here are reported
for the ﬁrst time in literature.

The notation of the spectral terms given below is proposed by Russell [16] and
Saunders [17] and now has been widely used.

L = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

L = 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 · · ·

R T U V W X Y Z 21 22 23 · · ·

When the orbital quantum number L is higher than 20, it is denoted by its
value. Owing to the length of the table, a compact format [18] of terms is
given here: A(Lk1L
k2 . . .), in which the superscript A indicates the multiplicity
of all terms included in the parentheses, and the subscripts k1, k2 indicate the
number of terms, for example 2G6 means that there are six 2G terms.

4.2 Derivation of the Even Rule for two equivalent electrons

If only two equivalent electrons are involved, there is an “Even Rule” [19]
which states

For two equivalent electrons the only states that are allowed are those for
which the sum (L + S) is even.

This rule can be deduced from our formulas as below. Based on equations (3)
and (2), we have

A(2, l, l, 0, ML) =

1 = 2l − ML + 1, (when 0 ≤ ML ≤ 2l).

{l, ML+l}min

XML− ={−l, ML−l}max

Based on equations (4) and (2), we have

A(2, l, lb, 2, ML) =

1

{lb, ML+l}min

ML
XMLI =⌊
2 +1⌋
ML

= lb − ⌊

(when 0 ≤ ML ≤ 2l − 1).

Hence, based on our main formula [equation (1)], we have

X(2, l, S′, L) = 


⌊ L
2 ⌋ − ⌊ L−1
⌊ L+1
2 ⌋ − ⌊ L


= ⌊
2

2 ⌋ when S′ = 0
2 ⌋ when S′ = 2
L + S − 1

⌋ − ⌊

⌋.

Therefore, only when (L + S) is even, the function X(N, l, S′, L) is not vanish,
viz. we get “Even Rule”.

4.3 Derivation of a new rule for three equivalent electrons

Based on our theory [equations (1)-(5)], we derived a new rule for three equiv-
alent electrons, which can be stated as a formula below

X(3, l, S′, L) =

L − ⌊ L

l − ⌊ L

⌊ L

X(3, l, S′, L) =

we have

A(3, l, l, 1, ML) =

S = 3,

|ML| ≤ f (2) = 3l − 3,

we have

5 CONCLUSION

Mainly based on a digital counting procedure, the alternative mathematical
technique to determine the LS spectral terms arising from lN conﬁgurations, is

11

immediately applicable for studies involving one orbital shell model. It makes
the calculation of coupled states of excited high energy electrons possible, and
oﬀered a basis for the further calculations of energy levels for laser and soft
X-ray. Though the derivation of our theory is a little complicated and thus is
presented in Appendix below. Compared to other theoretical methods reported
earlier in literature, this method is much more compact, and especially oﬀered
a direct way in calculation.

In addition, based on this alternative mathematical basis, we may also try
to calculate the statistical distribution of J-values for lN conﬁgurations [20],
and try to deduce some more powerful rules or formulas probably could be
deduced for determining the LS terms, such as equations (9) and (10). Indeed,
it may also be applicable to other coupling schemes.

A Derivation of the main formula equation (1)

Now we’ll determine the number of spectral terms having total orbital angular
quantum number L and total spin quantum number S′/2 arising from lN
electronic conﬁgurations, which is denoted by X(N, l, S′, L).

The number of spectral terms having allowed orbital magnetic quantum num-
0/2 in lN electronic conﬁgu-
ber L0 and spin magnetic quantum number S′
rations equals A(N, l, l, S′
0, L0), namely the number of spectral terms with
L ≥ L0, S ≥ S′
0/2. And these spectral terms can also be subdivided accord-
ing to their quantum numbers of L and S into four types as follows:

1(cid:13). L = L0, S = S′

0/2: the number of this type is X(N, l, S′

0, L0).

2(cid:13). L = L0, S ≥ S′

0

2 + 1: the number of this type equals

A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0) − A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0 + 1).

3(cid:13). L ≥ L0 + 1, S = S′

0/2: the number of this type equals

A(N, l, l, S′

0, L0 + 1) − A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0 + 1).

4(cid:13). L ≥ L0 + 1, S ≥ S′

0

2 + 1: the number of this type is A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0 + 1).

Hence, we have

A(N, l, l, S′

0, L0) = X(N, l, S′

0, L0) + A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0 + 1)

+ {A(N, l, l, S′
+ {A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0) − A(N, l, l, S′
0, L0 + 1) − A(N, l, l, S′

0 + 2, L0 + 1)}
0 + 2, L0 + 1)} .

(A.1)

12

Therefore

X(N, l, S′, L) = A(N, l, l, S′, L) + A(N, l, l, S′ + 2, L + 1) − A(N, l, l, S′ + 2, L)
(A.2)

− A(N, l, l, S′, L + 1).

B Derivation of equation (2)

For one-particle conﬁgurations (N = 1), there is only one spectral term. Thus
toward any allowable value of ML, we have

A(1, l, lb, 1, ML) = 1

(−l ≤ ML ≤ l).

(B.1)

C Derivation of equation (3)

In this case (N ≥ 2), there are some electrons spin-up and others spin-down.
Taking account of the Pauli principle, we sort the N electrons into two classes:
(1) Spin-down electrons class -(cid:13) consists of k− (≥ 1) electrons with msi =
−1/2 (i = 1, 2, . . . , k−); (2) Spin-up electrons class +(cid:13) consists of k+ (≥ 1)
electrons with msj = 1/2 (j = 1, 2, . . . , k+). In each class, the orbital magnetic
quantum number of each electron is diﬀerent from each other. The total spin
and orbital magnetic quantum number for class -(cid:13) are

C.1 The number of permitted states to each ML− value

When ML is ﬁxed, for each allowable value of ML−, there is a unique corre-
sponding value of ML+ = ML − ML−. We can denote by A(k−, l, l, M ′
s−, ML−)
the number of permitted states of the k− electrons in class -(cid:13) according to the
notations deﬁned in Section II. Based on any LS term having a spin magnetic
quantum number MS must also have a spin magnetic quantum number −MS,

13

we have

A(k−, l, l, M ′

s−, ML−) = A(k−, l, l, −M ′

s−, ML−) = A(k−, l, l, k−, ML−)

(C.3)

Correspondingly we denote by A(k+, l, l, M ′
s+, ML+) = A(k+, l, l, k+, ML −
ML−) for class +(cid:13). Hence, to any value of ML−, the total number of permitted
states of lN is A(k−, l, l, k−, ML−) A(k+, l, l, k+, ML − ML−).

C.2 Determination of the range of ML−

Firstly, the value of

mli is minimum, when the orbital magnetic quantum

numbers of the k− electrons in class -(cid:13) respectively are −l, −(l − 1), . . . , −(l −

Therefore, the equation (3) has been proved completely.

Now we discuss the case that all of the N electrons are spin-up, namely

M ′

S = N and MS = N/2.

Based on the Pauli exclusion principle, we can prescribe

(D.2)

I(cid:13) consists of
Now we also treat these electrons as two classes: (1) Class
the electron whose orbital magnetic quantum number is largest; (2) Class
II(cid:13) consists of the other electrons. Thus the total orbital magnetic quantum

D.1 The number of permitted states to each MLI value

In view of inequality (D.2), we have

(mli+1)max = mli − 1

(i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1).

(D.4)

Thus we can denote by A(N − 1, l, lb, N − 1, MLII ) which equals A(N −
1, l, MLI − 1, N − 1, ML − MLI ), the permitted states of class II(cid:13) consisting of
the latter (N − 1) electrons, according to the notations prescribed in Section
II. For any allowed value of MLI , there is only one state for class I(cid:13). Therefore,
to each value of MLI , the total number of permitted states of the N electrons
is A(N − 1, l, MLI − 1, N − 1, ML − MLI ).

Then in class II(cid:13), we can treat ml2 as MLI , and the latter (
Just continue our operation in this way, after (N − 1) times of operation, and
then based on equation (2), we can get the ﬁnal value of A(N, l, lb, N, ML).

In the following, we will prove

Because of the symmetrical situation between ML > 0 and ML < 0 to a
certain LS term, it is necessary only to consider the part of the case which
corresponds to ML ≥ 0.

In the case of MLI being minimum, we have

(ml2)min = MLI − 2

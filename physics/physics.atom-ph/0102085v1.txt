Abstract. The usefulness of study of hyperﬁne splitting in the hydrogen atom is
limited on a level of 10 ppm by our knowledge of the proton structure. One way to
go beyond 10 ppm is to study a speciﬁc diﬀerence of the hyperﬁne structure intervals
8∆ν2 − ∆ν1. Nuclear eﬀects for are not important this diﬀerence and it is of use to
study higher-order QED corrections.

1 Introduction

The hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state of the hydrogen atom has been for a
while one of the most precisely known physical quantities, however, its use for
tests of QED theory is limited by a lack of our knowledge of the proton structure.
The theoretical uncertainty due to that is on a level of 10 ppm. To go farther
with theory we need to eliminate the inﬂuence of the nucleus. A few ways have
been used (see e. g. [1]):

• to remove the proton from the hydrogen atom and to study a two-body
system, which is like hydrogen, but without any nuclear structure, namely:
muonium [2] or positronium [3];

• to compare the hyperﬁne structure intervals of the 1s and 2s states (this

work);

• to measure the hyperﬁne splitting in muonic hydrogen and to compare it
with the one in a normal hydrogen atom (a status report on the n = 2
muonic hydrogen project is presented in Ref. [4]; comparison of the 1s and
2s hfs and possibility to measure 1s hfs is considered in Ref. [5].

Recently there has been considerable progress in measurement and calculation
of the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state and the 2s1/2 state in the hydrogen
atom. The 2s1/2 hyperﬁne splitting in hydrogen was determined to be [6]

∆ν2(H) = 177 556.785(29) kHz ,

While less accurate than the classic determination of the ground state hyperﬁne
splitting, the combination of 1s and 2s hfs intervals

which is determined in the hydrogen atom [6] as

D21(H) = 48.528(232) kHz ,

has more implications for tests of bound state QED because there is signiﬁcantly
less dependence on the poorly understood proton structure contributions. Specif-
ically, the theoretical uncertainty for the ground state from the proton structure
is about 10 kHz, while the uncertainty for the combination is estimated to be
few Hz.

On the theoretical front, there has been considerable progress in the calcula-
tion of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting. Taken together with earlier calcula-
tions of D21 [14,15], which were possible because of cancellations of a number of
large terms, one can now give quite accurate values for ∆ν1 and ∆ν2, We collect
in Tables 1 and 2 along with the hydrogen results, the known experimental and
theoretical results for the deuterium atom and the 3He+ ion. The helium results
[7]

∆ν1(3He+) = 8665 649.867(10) kHz

and [8]

∆ν2(3He+) = 1083 354.969(30) kHz

lead to the most accurate value for the diﬀerence

D21(3He+) = 1 189.979(71) kHz .

2 Theory

We consider a hydrogen-like system with a nucleus of charge Z, mass M , spin I,
and magnetic moment µ. The basic scale of the hyperﬁne splitting is then given

Here we take the ﬁne structure constant α derived from g-2 value of electron
α−1 = 137.035 999 58(52). In addition we use a value the Rydberg constant of
Ryd = c Ry = 3.289 841 931 · 1012 kHz.

We present the hyperﬁne structure as a sum

∆νn = ∆νn(QED) + ∆νn(nuclear structure) .

2.1 Non-recoil limit

Some progress was achieved before we started our work. In particular, we

need to mention two results:

• Integrals, used for in Ref. [14], were evaluated later by P. Mohr1 with higher
accuracy and the constant was found to be -5.2212 instead of -5.37(6). The
theoretical prediction based on Eq. (19) but with a corrected value of the
contstant is Table 1 as “old theory”.

• Some nuclear-structure- and state-dependent corrections were found [23] for

arbitrary nS.

3.2 Our results

The similar diﬀerence has been under investigation also for the Lamb shift and a
number of useful auxiliary expressions have been found for calculating the state
dependent corrections to the Lamb shift [24].

Let us mention that an improvement in the accuracy and new result on higher
n hfs can be expected with progress in optical measurements and we present here
a progress also for higher n, deﬁning Dn1 = n3∆νn − ∆ν1.

• We have reproduced the logarithmic part of the self energy contribution and

found for arbitrary ns

4 Present status

To calculate the corrections presented in the previous sections, we have used
an eﬀective non-relativistic theory. In particular we have studied two kinds of
terms. One is a result of the second order perturbation theory with two δ(r)-
like potentials, evaluated in the leading non-relativistic approximation, while
the other is due to a more accurate calculation of a single delta-like poten-
tial. Both kinds contribute into the state-independent leading logarithmic cor-
rections (α2(Zα)2 ln2(Zα), α(Zα)2(m/M ) ln2(Zα), and α(Zα)3 ln(Zα)) and to
next-to-leading state-dependent terms (α2(Zα)2 ln(Zα), α(Zα)2(m/M ) ln(Zα),
and α(Zα)3). The crucial question is if we found all corrections in these orders.
Rederiving a leading term in order α(Zα)2 ln(Zα) within our technics, we can
easily incorporate the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in the cal-
culation and restore the nuclear mass dependence. Since we reproduce the well-
known result for the α(Zα)2 ln(Zα) term, we consider that as a conﬁrmation of
two other logarithmic corrections found by us. In the case of α(Zα)3 it might
be a contribution of an eﬀective operator, proportional to (∆/m)δ(r). That can
give no logarithmic corrections, but leads to a state-dependent constant. We are
now studying this possibility.

Summarizing all corrections, the ﬁnal QED result is found to be:

Numerical results (in kHz) for hydrogen and deuterium atoms and the helium-
3 ion are collected in Table 2. One can see that the new corrections essentially
shift the theoretical predictions. A comparison of the QED predictions (in kHz)
against the experiments is summarized in Table 1. We take the values of the
fundamental constants (like e. g. the ﬁne structure constant α) from the recent
adjustment (see Ref. [25]).

An important point is that the diﬀerence is sensitive to 4th order corrections
and so is competitive with the muonium hfs as a test of the QED. The diﬀerence
between the QED part of the theory and the experiment is an indication of
higher-order corrections due to the QED and the nuclear structure, which have
to be studied in detail. In particular, we have to mention that while we expect
that we have a complete result on logarithmic corrections and on the vacuum-

polarization part of the α(Zα)3 term we anticipate more contributions in the
order α(Zα)3 due to the self-energy. A complete study of this term oﬀers a
possibility to determine the magnetic radius of the proton, deuteron and helion-

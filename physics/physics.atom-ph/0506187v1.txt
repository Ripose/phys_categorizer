Nonsequential multiple ionization of atoms in intense laser ﬁelds is initiated by a recollision
between an electron, freed by tunneling, and its parent ion. Following recollision, the initial electron
shares its energy with several bound electrons. We use a classical model based on rapid electron
thermalization to interpret recent experiments. For neon, good agreement with the available data
is obtained with an upper bound of 460 attoseconds for the thermalization time.

PACS numbers:

Atoms exposed to intense laser ﬁelds ionize. The freed
electron and its ionic partner are accelerated by the laser
ﬁeld away from each other. When the ﬁeld changes sign,
it may drive the electron into a recollision with the ion.
This simple mechanism, which for high-intensity low-
frequency ﬁelds is largely classical, governs many laser-
atom processes such as high-order harmonic generation
(HHG), high-order above-threshold ionization (HATI),
and nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) and explains
the gross features of the spectra observed [1].

The period of the commonly applied titanium-sapphire
(Ti:Sa) laser is about 2.7 fs. The recollision physics un-
fold on the time scale of a small fraction of the laser pe-
riod. Therefore, the analysis of laser-induced recollision
phenomena provides access to the inner-atomic dynamics
on the attosecond time scale and, indeed, the focus of re-
cent investigations has moved into this temporal domain.
For example, it has brought molecular imaging with sub-
angstrom spatial and subfemtosecond temporal resolu-
tion within reach [2, 3]. The advent of phase-stabilized
infrared few-cycle pulses and of uv pulses of attosecond
duration allows even more control [4], but neither are
necessary for a study of the attosecond dynamics.

In this Letter, we analyze recent experiments on nonse-
quential multiple ionization (NSMI) of neon [5,6] in which
the momentum distributions of NeN + (N = 3, 4) were
measured at two intensities. We use the fact that the
time-dependent laser ﬁeld provides a clock — the ﬁeld
accelerates the ion to a ﬁnal velocity that depends on
the times at which the N electrons ionized. This “streak
camera” [7] therefore measures the range of times of ion-
ization. Comparing the measured momentum distribu-
tions to those predicted by a classical model, we infer that
the recolliding electron thermalizes with the N
1 bound
electrons in less than 500 attoseconds. To our knowledge,
no other method allows such a low upper bound for ther-
malization times within atoms to be measured.

−

Nonsequential double and multiple ionization is de-
ﬁned by the fact that it is not sequential, that is, it is
not the product of a sequence of uncorrelated single-

ionization events. NSDI and NSMI require electron-
electron correlation as a necessary precondition [5, 8].
Even for the very simplest such process – NSDI of helium
– a fully quantum-mechanical description from ﬁrst prin-
ciples, i.e. by solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation in six spatial dimensions, has not been accom-
plished yet [9], and for the heavier atoms it is clearly
out of the question. This leaves approximate quantum-
mechanical approaches, such as density-functional meth-
ods [10], S-matrix methods that try to identify the most
relevant terms of an appropriate perturbative expansion
[11, 12], or classical-trajectory methods [13, 14]. For mul-
tiple (triple and higher) ionization, which occurs under
the same conditions as NSDI if the laser intensity is high
enough, any description from ﬁrst principles appears to

three electrons and more, to identify the relevant dia-
grams in the microscopic S-matrix approach.

The model we here propose is in the spirit of the one
of Ref. [12], but essentially classical. We investigate the
scenario wherein NSMI is eﬀected by one single recolli-
sion. We assume that the pertinent electron tunnels into
the continuum with zero velocity at the ionization time t′
according to the time-dependent rate R(t′), for which we
adopt the standard quasi-static rate [15]. Thereafter, we
turn to an entirely classical description: The laser ﬁeld
may drive the electron back to its parent ion at a later
time t, which is a function t(t′) of the ionization time
and can be easily evaluated. We assume that the en-
ergy Eret(t) of the returning electron be completely ther-
malized among the ensemble of participating electrons,
that is, the returning electron and the N
1 electrons to
be freed. These N electrons then form an excited com-
plex with the total energy (with respect to the continuum
0 > 0 denotes the
threshold) Eret(t)
total ionization potential of the N
1 (up to the recol-
lision time t inactive) electrons. The distribution of en-
ergy and momentum over the N electrons is assumed to
be completely statistical and only governed by the avail-
able phase space. At the time t + ∆t, the N electrons

by the vector potential A(t) such that A(t) = 0 outside
the pulse.

The corresponding distribution of the ﬁnal electron

For comparison with the experiments [5, 6], we cal-
culate the distribution of the momentum P of the ion.
Provided the momentum of the absorbed laser photons
can be neglected, momentum conservation implies P =

where the integral extends over the ionization time t′.
The δ function expresses the fact that the total kinetic
energy of the N participating electrons at the time t+ ∆t
is ﬁxed by the ﬁrst-ionized electron at its recollision time
t. This constitutes the one and only condition on the ﬁnal
momenta pn. The only free parameter of this model is
the time delay ∆t between the recollision time and the
time when the electrons become free. It is the sum of a
thermalization time ∆tth – the time it takes to establish
the statistical ensemble – and a possible additional “dwell
time”, until the electrons become free. By comparing the
predictions of the model with the data, we will be able
to infer a value of ∆t, which in turn provides an upper
limit for the thermalization time ∆tth.

This model is an extension to NSMI of a classical
model introduced for NSDI for ∆t = 0 [16, 17]. Suf-
ﬁciently high above threshold, it produced momentum
distributions that were virtually indistinguishable from
their quantum-mechanical counterparts. Statistical mod-
els similar to the one above have been used in many areas
of physics. For example, the statistical Rice-Ramsperger-
Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory [18] describes thermal-
ization of molecular vibrational degrees of freedom, and
for high-energy collisions of elementary particles and
heavy ions statistical models have been utilized to predict
the momentum spectra of the reaction products [19]. An
excited complex as the doorway to NSMI was also con-
sidered in Ref. [20].

A convenient feature of the ansatz (1) is that integra-
tion over unobserved momentum components is easily
carried out. To this end, we exponentialize the δ func-
tion in Eq. (1) with the help of its Fourier representation

In Fig. 1 we present calculations of the ion-momentum
distributions for triple (upper panel) and quadruple
(lower panel) NSMI of neon according to Eq. (5), for
various values of ∆t between 0 and 0.2T . The parame-
ters are for the experimental data of neon presented in
Fig. 2 of Ref. [6]. The ﬁgure displays the double-hump
structure of the ion momentum in NSMI of neon. When
the time delay ∆t increases from 0, initially, the eﬀect on
the momentum distribution is small. Later, however, the
center positions of the humps start moving towards zero
momentum and the widths of the humps increase until
the two humps begin to merge. This behavior can easily
be understood from the recollision kinematics, which are
illustrated in Fig. 2. The ﬁnal electrons undergo maxi-
mal acceleration if they are released near a zero crossing
of the electric ﬁeld, which in the ﬁgure occurs at t = T .
For the example of triple ionization of neon, the earliest
recollision with Eret > E(3)
takes place at t = 0.74T .
Already with a delay of ∆t > 0.26T , all electrons will be
released after the zero crossing, which results in signiﬁ-
cantly lower ion momenta.

models of the type discussed in Refs. [12, 16, 17] and the
data. For triple ionization, the calculated momentum
distributions are wider than those of the data, in partic-
ular for the higher intensity, even though the data may
include a contribution of the partly sequential channel
Ne3+, or the contribution of a recollision-
Ne
excitation channel, both of which are, of course, not part

Figure 4 exhibits the results of our thermalization
model for N = 3 for the conditions of Ref. [5]. The dis-
tribution of two components of the ion momentum is pre-
sented, the component parallel to the laser ﬁeld and one
transverse component, which therefore provides a more
stringent test of the model. The third component is in-
tegrated over in the data, which corresponds to Eq. (6).
The intensity given in the experiment is 1.5 PWcm−2;
we obtain good agreement with the data for the lower
intensity of 1.0 PWcm−2 and ∆t = 0.17T as before [22].
The nonzero delay ∆t has little eﬀect on the transverse
width of the distribution, but it causes an elongation in
the longitudinal direction and moves the centers to lower
momenta, markedly improving the agreement with the
data.

Encouraged by the good agreement between the model
and the data, we interpret the delay for which we ob-
served optimal agreement as an upper bound of the
thermalization time ∆tth, as argued above. This yields
∆tth < ∆topt = 0.17T
460 as. A lower limit of the
thermalization time should be given by the inverse of
the plasma frequency for an electron density ρe = N in
π/N , which is of
atomic units. This produces ∆tth <
the order of the atomic unit of time.

≃

All of the above discussion has been for neon. NSDI of
argon appears to be governed by a recollision-excitation
scenario [23]. We note in passing that for (quadruple)
NSMI of argon we get good agreement of our statistical
thermalization model with the data [6] for the experi-
mental intensity and ∆t = 0.35T , twice as long as for
neon. Details will be given elsewhere.

p

To test the model further, and possibly to set a tighter
upper limit on the thermalization time, it is necessary to
restrict the time range ∆tCM of recollision (Fig. 2).
If
thermalization is more rapid than 460 as, then the width
of the ion-momentum distribution will decrease as we re-
strict ∆trec. There are a number of ways to minimize
∆trec. Within limits, all that is needed is to lower the
light intensity or to increase the laser frequency. How-
ever, the best way to minimize ∆trec and to control the
time of recollision is to use a second harmonic ﬁeld, po-
larized perpendicular to the fundamental. The combined
requirement that the electron and ion recollide in both
directions allows the time of recollision to be precisely
determined and controlled via the relative phase of the
two beams.

The limit on the thermalization time that we deter-

4

mine (as well as the much tighter bounds that seem fea-
sible in future experiments) should apply to stationary
electron-atom scattering in general. From a collision-
physics perspective, as a result of streaking, the time-
dependent laser ﬁeld reveals information that is hard to
obtain by other means. The streaking principle should
also be applicable for studying nuclear dynamics. As in
NSMI, nuclear processes also can be initiated by laser-
controlled re-collision [24] (of course, at much higher in-
tensity). Any nuclear decay process that results in a mass
or charge change of the fragments will be streaked by the
laser ﬁeld just as electrons and ions are streaked in our
case.

To summarize, by comparison of experimental data
for triple and quadruple nonsequential ionization of neon
with a simple statistical recollision model where the re-
turning electron thermalizes with a subset of the bound
electrons, we have been able to conclude that (i) for
neon such a model appears to contain the most relevant
physics, and (ii) the time for this thermalization to occur
is extremely fast, well below one femtosecond.

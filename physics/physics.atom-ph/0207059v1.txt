Using a newly developed laser-microwave-laser resonance method, we observed a pair of microwave
transitions between hyperﬁne levels of the (n, L) = (37, 35) state of antiprotonic helium. This
experiment conﬁrms the quadruplet hyperﬁne structure due to the interaction of the antiproton
orbital angular momentum, the electron spin and the antiproton spin as predicted by Bakalov and

GHz agree with recent theoretical calculations on a level of 6 × 10−5.

In this paper we report the ﬁrst observation of
microwave-induced transitions between magnetic sub-
states of antiprotonic helium and use the results to de-
termine its quadruplet hyperﬁne splitting to better than
10−5). Antiprotonic he-

lium is an exotic three-body system consisting of a helium
nucleus, an antiproton, and an electron (p
≡
pHe+). It has a series of highly excited metastable states
(lifetime
µs) with principal quantum number n and
angular momentum quantum number L in the range 33–
39, which have been extensively studied by laser spec-
troscopy (see [1, 2] and a comprehensive review [3]). In
the most recent experiments performed at the CERN
Antiproton Decelerator (AD), the wavelengths of sev-
eral laser-induced transitions of the antiproton in pHe+
10−7,
were measured with a relative accuracy of 1.3
leading to a CPT test limiting any relative diﬀerence in
the masses and charges of the proton and antiproton to
10−8 [4]. A step further in the precision spectroscopy
6
of antiprotonic helium is the investigation of its mag-
netic hyperﬁne structure, i.e., the level splitting caused
by the magnetic interaction of the p orbital angular mo-
mentum ~Lp, the electron spin ~Se, and the p spin ~Sp. To
the leading order, the electron in pHe+ is in the ground
state with a spin magnetic moment ~µe = ge µB ~Se. The p
magnetic moment, on the other hand, consists of an or-
bital part and a spin part ~µp = (gp
~Sp) µN. The
ℓ
orbital g-factor, gp
ℓ , deﬁnes the relation between the p
orbital magnetic moment and the anti-nuclear magneton
µN = Qp¯h/(2Mp). Its value is usually implicitly taken to
be one, but this assumption has never been tested exper-
imentally before, either for the proton or the antiproton.
Due to the large angular momentum of pHe+, the
dominant splitting arises from the magnetic interaction
of ~Se with ~Lp. Thus, the coupling of ~µp with ~µe cre-

ates a doublet (called here hyperﬁne (HF) splitting) with
~F = ~Lp + ~Se (F − = L
1/2 and F + = L + 1/2). The
interaction of the p spin magnetic moment with the other
magnetic moments splits each sublevel F + and F − into a
still ﬁner doublet, and if ~J = ~F + ~Sp is the total angular
momentum, these further sublevels are associated with
its components J −+ = F − +1/2 = L, J −− = F −

The theoretical

plings, yield the level order as shown in Fig. 1(a) due to
an approximate cancellation of the latter two spin-spin
coupling terms. Typical values for the HF splitting of
metastable states are νHF = 10 – 15 GHz, while the SHF
±
splitting is almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller (νSHF
= 150 – 300 MHz). In a previous experiment at LEAR
we indeed observed a doublet splitting of the unfavoured
laser transition (n, L) = (37, 35)
(38, 34) at λ = 726.1
f− =
nm, the two sub-lines being separated by ∆ = f+ −
νHF(initial)
0.05 GHz [6], in agree-
ment with the theoretical value [5]. Although the SHF
splitting is too small to be resolved with the pulsed laser
system used in our experiments, it causes a small splitting
of the hyperﬁne transition into two components, ν+
HF and

J +−, respectively, as

shown in Fig. 1(a). In order to determine the two hyper-
ﬁne frequencies of the (37, 35) state on the MHz level di-
rectly, we developed the laser-microwave-laser resonance
method described below.

FIG. 2: Side view of the cryostat holding the helium tar-

the helium chamber from left and stop inside a cylindrical
microwave cavity. Two overlapping laser beams come from

pulse therefore superposes a sharp spike onto the ADATS
(cf. Fig. 3) whose area is proportional to the population
of the metastable state at the time of the arrival of the
laser pulse.

The laser-microwave-laser resonance method utilizes
the following sequence: i) a laser pulse tuned to one of the
doublet lines (e.g. f+ in Fig. 1(a)) preferentially depop-
ulates the F + over the F − doublet. ii) The microwave
−
pulse is applied; if it is resonant with either ν+
HF,
it transfers population from the F − to the F + doublet.
iii) A second laser pulse at frequency f+ measures the
new population of F + after the microwave pulse.

The laser light of λ = 726.1 nm was produced by a com-
mercial dye laser pumped by a Nd:YAG laser which was
triggered synchronously with the arrival of the antipro-
ton pulse. The line width of the dye laser with intra-
cavity etalon was 0.6–0.8 GHz. A resonance scan (cf.
Fig. 1(b)) showed a doublet structure with a separation
0.1 GHz, in agreement with our
of ∆ = f+ −
earlier observation at LEAR [6]. The two sequential laser
pulses were obtained by dividing the output of the dye
laser and delaying one part by multiple reﬂections.
In
this way a maximum delay of 160 ns could be obtained
without seriously degrading the laser beam spot quality.
The laser power density was adjusted to achieve an op-
timum compromise between the depletion eﬃciency, i.e.,
the eﬃciency of depopulation of the F + doublet, and the
power broadening which reduces the population asym-
metry.

is the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld. From
this formula as well as from detailed numerical simula-
tions [7, 8] it follows that in order to induce an M1 tran-
sition in the 160 ns time diﬀerence between the two laser
pulses, a B1 of several gauss is needed. To apply the mi-
crowave radiation, we constructed a cylindrical cavity for
12.9 GHz (diameter 28.8 mm, length 24.6 mm)
νMW ∼
resonating in the TM110 mode. The ends of the cylin-
der were covered by metal meshes with a transparency
of 85% permitting the p and the two laser beams to en-
ter from opposite directions. The cavity was immersed
in the low-temperature helium gas, and the microwave
radiation was applied through a rectangular wave guide.
An external triple stub tuner (TST) was used to tune the
central frequency and Q-value of the cavity, thus allow-
ing the microwave frequency to be scanned over a range
1.5% of the resonance
of
200 MHz corresponding to
2700 [8]. The res-
frequency, while keeping Q-values of
onance characteristics of the cavity were measured with
a vector network analyzer (VNA) both in reﬂection and
in transmission mode. The microwave pulse to induce
the electron spin-ﬂip transition was generated by ampli-
fying the VNA output by a pulsed travelling wave tube
ampliﬁer (TWTA).

A measurement cycle consisted of

the following
computer-controlled steps. Before arrival of the antipro-
tons, the three stubs of the TST were set to obtain the
desired resonance frequency and Q-value, and the cavity
characteristics were veriﬁed using the VNA. The VNA
was then tuned to this frequency, and upon arrival of the
p beam, we ﬁred the two laser pulses and the microwave
pulse into the target. The ADATS of two ˇCerenkov
counters showing two laser spikes each (cf. Fig. 3) were
recorded.

We collected data during ﬁve 8-hour periods. At the
beginning of each period, the laser alignment and de-
pletion eﬃciency were veriﬁed. We then collected ap-
proximately 180–290 AD shots, stepping through 10–30
microwave frequencies in cycles. The microwave power
was set to the optimum value (15 W) corresponding to
an oscillating ﬁeld strength of B1 = 7 gauss inside the
cavity as obtained from computer simulations. Each cy-
cle included 1–3 points at very low microwave power for
use as “microwave-oﬀ” reference points.

For each ADATS of one data taking period, we ﬁtted a
background function (a sum of two exponentials) to the
time spectra in the range from 60 ns after the PMT was
turned on to 500 ns after the ﬁrst laser peak, excluding
the two peak regions from the ﬁt as shown in Fig. 3.
We extracted the diﬀerence between the observed spec-
trum and the ﬁt function in the two peak windows as
shown in Fig. 3. The peak areas I+(ti) are proportional
to the population of the F + doublet at time ti. In order
to reduce systematic eﬀects such as ﬂuctuations in the
overlap of laser and p beams or the p intensity, which
might aﬀect both peaks identically, we calculated the ra-
tio R++
I+(t2)/I+(t1) and plotted it against νMW.
The individual data sets each showed two peaks at the
−
theoretically predicted positions for ν+
HF. The
oﬀ-resonance value of R++ agreed with the points taken
at extremely low microwave power, but both varied from
data set to data set. This results from uncontrollable
systematic eﬀects associated mainly with laser misalign-
ments.

Each data set was ﬁtted by a sum of two Lorentzian
functions with identical width and amplitude, plus a con-
−
stant background. The results for ν+
HF as well as
the width of the Lorentzians agreed within the error bars
and did not show any dependence on the target density.

This is consistent with theoretical arguments presented
by Korenman [9] that the shift of the line centres with
density is very small, and that the collisional broadening
at our densities is of the order of MHz.

We therefore normalized the individual data sets to
the microwave-oﬀ value R++

0.7 MHz to give the ﬁnal spectrum shown in Fig. 4. The
chosen averaging interval was smaller than the line width
γobs = 1/(2π 160 ns) = 1.0 MHz corresponding to the
160-ns observation time window. The natural width of
the (37, 35) state of γ(37,35) = 0.12 MHz is smaller than
γobs, while the measured line width γexp = 5.3
0.7 MHz
was signiﬁcantly larger. This may be due to collisions, to
the inhomogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld over the stopping
distribution of p, or to the fact that the many substates
with magnetic quantum numbers m =
J . . . J each have
diﬀerent Rabi frequencies.
The ﬁnal results for ν+

HF distribute over a much
wider range (
100 ppm) than the laser transition ener-
0.1 ppm) calculated by the same groups (see com-
gies (
parison in Ref. [4]), reﬂecting a higher sensitivity of the
hyperﬁne coupling terms to the details of the wave func-
tions involved. Nevertheless, the experimental values are
in excellent agreement with the results of Korobov and
Bakalov (both their initial values BK [5] and their most
recent ones KB [10]) as well as the latest values of Kino
et al. (K [11]).

In summary, we have established a laser-microwave-
laser resonance method and succeeded in observing two

microwave transitions, ν+
HF, in antiprotonic he-
HF and ν
lium. The experiment has fully conﬁrmed the presence
of a quadruplet structure originating from the hyperﬁne
coupling of ~Lp, ~Se, and ~Sp, as predicted by Bakalov and
Korobov [5]. The agreement of the experimental values

frequencies, ν+
HF, are primarily related to the
dominant p orbital magnetic moment, which is probed
by the aid of the large electron magnetic moment. As
implied in the deﬁnition of ~µp (paragraph 1), ν+

dependence is however too weak to permit a precise de-
termination of gp

between experiment and theory can be interpreted as an
experimental measurement of the antiprotonic orbital g-

that no experimental value exists for gp

because no atoms with an orbiting proton exist in the

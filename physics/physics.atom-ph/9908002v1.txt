(submitted Phys. Rev. A)

We calculate the two-photon 1S-2S spectrum of an atomic
hydrogen Bose-Einstein condensate in the regime where the
cold collision frequency shift dominates the lineshape. WKB
and static phase approximations are made to ﬁnd the inten-
sities for transitions from the condensate to motional eigen-
states for 2S atoms. The excited state wave functions are
found using a mean ﬁeld potential which includes the eﬀects
of collisions with condensate atoms. Results agree well with
experimental data. This formalism can be used to ﬁnd con-
densate spectra for a wide range of excitation schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the recent experimental observation of Bose-
Einstein condensation (BEC) in atomic hydrogen [1], the
cold collision frequency shift in the 1S-2S photoexcita-
tion spectrum [2] signalled the presence of a condensate.
The shift arises because electronic energy levels are per-
turbed due to interactions, or collisions, with neighbor-
ing atoms.
In the cold collision regime, the tempera-
ture is low enough that the s-wave scattering length, a,
is much less than the thermal de Broglie wavelength,
h2/2πmkBT , and only s-waves are involved in
λT =
the collisions [3].
p

The cold collision frequency shift has also been stud-
ied in the hyperﬁne spectrum of hydrogen in cryogenic
masers [4], and cesium [5–7] and rubidium [8] in atomic
fountains. Theoretical explanations of these results and
other work on the hydrogen 1S-2S spectrum [9,10] have
focused on the magnitude of the shift, as opposed to a
lineshape. In this article we present a calculation of the
hydrogen BEC 1S-2S spectrum. We also describe how
the formalism can be used for other atomic systems and
experimental conditions.

A. The Experiment

The experiment is described in [1,2], and we summa-
rize the important aspects here. Hydrogen atoms in the
1S, F = 1, mF = 1 state are conﬁned in a magnetic
trap and evaporatively cooled. The hydrogen condensate
is observed in the temperature range 30-70 µK and the
condensate fraction never exceeds a few percent. Never-
theless, the peak density in the normal cloud is almost

two orders of magnitude lower than in the condensate
and in this study we will neglect the presence of the non-
condensed gas.

The two-photon transition to the metastable 2S, F =
1, mF = 1 state (τ = 122 ms) is driven by a 243 nm laser
beam which passes through the sample and is retrore-
ﬂected.
In this conﬁguration, an atom can absorb one
photon from each direction. This results in Doppler-free
excitation for which there is no momentum transferred
to the atom and no Doppler-broadening of the resonance.
An atom can also absorb two co-propagating photons and
receive a momentum kick. This is Doppler-sensitive exci-
tation, and the spectrum in this case is recoil shifted and
Doppler-broadened. The photo-excitation rate is moni-
tored by counting 122 nm ﬂuorescence photons from the
excited state. For a typical laser pulse of 500 µs, fewer
than 1 in 104 of the atoms are promoted to the 2S state.
The natural linewidth of the 1S-2S transition is 1.3 Hz,
but the experimental width, at low density and temper-
ature, is limited by the laser coherence time. The nar-
rowest observed spectra, obtained when studying a non-
condensed gas, have widths of a few kHz [11]. For the
condensate, the cold collision frequency shift is as much
as one MHz and it dominates the lineshape.

B. Origin of the Cold Collision Frequency Shift

−

A qualitative analogy with light and atom optics is in-
structive for understanding the nature of the collisions
which cause the frequency shift. In a medium with com-
plex index of refraction ˜n, the spatial propagation of a
plane wave of light obeys E(x) = E(0)exp(i˜nkx), where k
1 shifts
is the wave vector in vacuum. The real part of ˜n
the wavelength, while the imaginary part of ˜n produces
absorption or scattering. A matter wave propagates sim-
ilarly in a density n of scatterers at rest [12]. The index
of refraction is ˜n = 1 + (2π/klabkc)nf (kc, 0), where klab
and kc are the propagation wave vectors in the lab and
collisional center of mass frames respectively, and f (kc, 0)
is the forward scattering amplitude. The familiar total
scattering cross section is given by the optical theorem,
σt = (4π/kc)Im[f (kc, 0)].

In the cold collision regime, f (kc, 0)

a + ikca2 and
σt = 4πa2. Assuming particles of equal mass (kc =
klab/2), we can evaluate ˜n and transform to a frame mov-
¯hklabt/m). Collisions

We ﬁnd a density dependent shift in the time derivative
of the wave function’s phase, δω = 4π¯han/m. This would
imply a frequency shift for a resonant transition and is
the origin of the cold collision frequency shift. The ef-
fect results from forward scattering events which do not
change the momentum of the scatterers, and is analogous
to the change in wavelength for light. Both phenomena
are described by Re(˜n
1). Attenuation of the wave
function from Im(˜n) arises from momentum randomizing
collisions, which also maintain thermal equilibrium and
cause dephasing or broadening of resonant transitions.

−

c = λ2

An intuitive picture of the frequency shift results if we
deﬁne δω to be the product of the phase shift per collision
(kca) and a forward collision rate (nvlabσf ). One ﬁnds
that the “cross section” for forward scattering events is
σf = 2π/k2
deBroglie/2π. In the cold collision regime
(kca < 2π), σf is larger than σt. Atoms interact at large
distances, but each long range interaction is weak and
only produces a small phase shift of the wave function.
0, the momentum-changing elastic collision rate,
As T
nvlabσt, vanishes, but δω = kca nvlabσf = 4π¯han/m re-
mains constant because σf increases as the phase shift
per collision and vlab decrease.

C. Mean Field Description of the Spectrum

The collisional description given above is in the spirit of
theory based on the quantum Boltzmann equation [4,5,8],
which has been used to explain the frequency shifts in
maser and fountain experiments. A mean ﬁeld descrip-
tion, however, is more convenient for studying a spatially
inhomogeneous system such as a trapped Bose-Einstein
condensate. In this picture, collisions add a mean ﬁeld
energy to the atom’s potential energy. For a 2S atom
excited out of a condensate, or a 1S condensate atom,
the mean ﬁeld term is δEx(r) = 4π¯h2a1S−xn1S(r)/m,
where x is either 1S or 2S. (The fraction of excited 2S
atoms is small, so 2S-2S interactions can be neglected.)
The ground state s-wave triplet scattering length has
been calculated accurately (a1S−1S = 0.0648 nm [13]).
The 1S-2S scattering length, however, is less well known
(a1S−2S =
0.3 nm from experiment [2] and -2.3 nm
±
from theory [14]).

1.4

−

We denote the sum of the magnetic trap potential and
the mean ﬁeld energy as the eﬀective potential (Fig. 1).
For 1S condensate atoms, the eﬀective potential in the
condensate is ﬂat. Because a1S−2S < 0 and the conden-
sate density is large, 2S atoms experience a stiﬀ attrac-
tive potential in the condensate which supports many
bound 2S motional states.

The 1S-2S spectrum consists of transitions from the
condensate to 2S motional eigenstates of the eﬀective 2S
potential. For Doppler-free excitation, the ﬁnal states are
bound in the BEC well. Doppler-sensitive excitation pop-
ulates states which lie about ¯h2k2
0/2mkb = 644 µK above
the bottom of the 2S potential, where ¯hk0 is the mo-

mentum carried by two laser photons. The latter states
extend over a region much greater than the condensate.
Because the excited levels are so diﬀerent for Doppler-
free and Doppler-sensitive excitation, we must treat the
two spectra independently.

This rest of this article presents a derivation of the ef-
fective potentials and a quantum mechanical calculation
of the BEC 1S-2S spectrum.

FIG. 1. Eﬀective potentials for 1S atoms in the condensate
and excited 2S atoms. Selected single particle wave functions
are displayed at the height corresponding to their energy. The
dashed lines are the magnetic trapping potential V (r), which
is identical for 1S and 2S atoms. The thin solid lines are
the eﬀective potentials, which include the mean ﬁeld inter-
action energy. The vertical light solid lines indicate allowed
Doppler-free transitions from the condensate, which must pre-
serve mirror symmetry. The potentials and condensate wave
−3
function are for a peak condensate density of 5 × 1015 cm
(µ/kB ≈ 2 µK), and a magnetic trap oscillation frequency of 4
kHz, which are characteristic conditions for a hydrogen BEC
and a strong conﬁnement axis of the trap [1,2]. The scattering
lengths used in the calculations are a1S−1S = 0.0648 nm and
a1S−2S = −1.4 nm. The 2S levels form a near continuum of
motional states in an anisotropic three dimensional trap.

Inelastic collisions, such as collisions in which the hy-
perﬁne level of one or both of the colliding partners
changes, will contribute additional shifts which are not
included in this formalism, but these eﬀects are expected
to be small in the experiment [2].

We make the approximation that the system is at T =
0, and all atoms are initially in the condensate. T =
0 models have accurately described many condensates
properties [20], and we leave ﬁnite temperature eﬀects

Doppler-free excitation populates states which are
bound inside the BEC potential well (see Fig. 1). For a
condensate in a harmonic trap, these states are approxi-
mately eigenstates of a three dimensional harmonic oscil-
lator with trap frequencies larger than those of the mag-
netic trap alone by a factor of
6.
Because we know the wave functions, we can numerically
evaluate Eq. 20. The result of such a calculation is shown
in Fig. 2.

tuning is the unperturbed Doppler-free transition frequency.
The stick spectrum results from the sum over the transition
amplitudes expressed in Eq. 20 using the Thomas-Fermi den-
−3
sity distribution for a peak condensate density of 1016 cm
(4π¯h2(a1S−2S − a1S−1S)n(0)/m ≈ 2h × −0.95 MHz). The
trap is spherically symmetric with ωtrap = 2π × 6 kHz. The
stick heights represent the coeﬃcients of delta functions which
must be convolved with the laser spectrum. The dashed curve
(Eq. 25) follows from the integral over the BEC density dis-
tribution, Eq. 24, for the same peak condensate density. The
envelope is independent of the symmetry of the trap, but the
stick spectrum blends into a continuum in a trap with one
weak conﬁnement axis such as the MIT hydrogen trap [1,2].

At large red detuning (2h δν

transitions are to the lowest state in the BEC interac-
tion well. The spectrum does not extend to the blue of
2h δν = 0 because states outside the well have negligi-
ble overlap with the condensate and are inaccessible by
laser excitation. In the overlap integrals in Fig. 2, wave
functions for an inﬁnite harmonic trap were used for the
2S motional states. These deviate from the actual mo-
tional states near the top of the BEC interaction well,
introducing small errors in the stick spectrum nearer zero
detuning.

The envelope of the spectrum in Fig. 2 can be derived
analytically and reveals some interesting physics. The

E1S−2S. This suggests the excitation rate is proportional
to the integral of the condensate density in a shell at
the equipotential surface deﬁned by the classical turning

For a spherically symmetric trap, we can formally show
this by making WKB and static phase approximations
[27,28] - a technique which has recently been applied
to describe s-wave collision photoassociation spectra [29]
and quasiparticle excitation in a condensate [30]. One
uses a WKB expression for the 2S eigenstate. Then, be-
cause of the slow spatial variation of the condensate wave
function, the Doppler-free overlap factor only depends on
the condensate wavefunction and the 1S and 2S poten-
tials where the phase of the upper state is stationary.

Using the probabilistic interpretation of

2 (Sec.

II B), one can interpret Eq. 24 in the following way.
When a 2S excitation is detected at a given frequency, it
records the fact that a 1S atom was found at a position
which had a 1S density which brought that atom into
resonance with the laser. The rate of excitation is pro-
portional to the probability of ﬁnding a condensate atom
in a region with the correct density. This is a local den-
sity description of the spectrum, and it is justiﬁed by the
slow spatial variation of the condensate wave function.

For a Thomas-Fermi wave function in a three dimen-

sional harmonic trap, Eq. 24 reduces to

Figure 2 shows that for a spherically symmetric trap,
Eq. 25 agrees with the spectrum calculated directly with
Fermi’s Golden Rule (Eq. 20) using simple harmonic os-
cillator wave functions. For a trap which has a weak
conﬁnement axis, such as the MIT hydrogen trap [1,2],
discrete transitions in the spectrum are too closely spaced
to be resolved. The envelope given by Eq. 25, however,
shows no dependence on the trap frequencies or the sym-
metry (or lack thereof) of the harmonic trap.

Theory and experimental data are compared in Fig.
3. Although the statistical error bars for the data are
large due to the small number of counted photons, the
theoretical BEC spectrum for a condensate at T = 0
ﬁts the data reasonably well. The deviations may indi-
cate nonzero temperature eﬀects or reﬂect experimental
noise. The smoothing of the cutoﬀ at large detuning may
be due to shot to shot variation in the peak condensate
density for the 10 atom trapping cycles which contribute
to this composite spectrum. Also, at low detuning the
BEC spectrum is aﬀected by the wing of the Doppler-free
line for the noncondensed atoms.

Using this theory, from the peak shift in the spectrum,
the trap oscillation frequencies, and knowledge of a1S−1S
and a1S−2S, one can calculate the number of atoms in the
condensate. Assuming the experimental value of a1S−2S,
the result is larger than the number determined from
a model of the BEC lifetime and loss rates, which is
discussed in [31]. The uncertainties are large for these
results, but the disagreement could be due to error in
the experimental value of a1S−2S, uncertainty in the gas
temperature or trap and laser parameters, or thermody-
namic conditions in the trapped gas which are diﬀerent
than assumed by the theories. For example, we have im-
plicitly assumed local spatial coherence (g(2)(0) = 1) [32]
It has

not yet been experimentally veriﬁed that the hydrogen
condensate is coherent.

FIG. 3. Doppler-free spectrum of a condensate: compari-
son of theory and experiment (from [1]). The narrow feature
near zero detuning is the spectral contribution from the non-
condensed atoms (shown ×1/40). The broad feature is the
spectrum of the condensate. The dashed curve is Eq. 25,
which comes from the integral over the BEC density distribu-
tion (Eq. 24) assuming a Thomas-Fermi density distribution
for a harmonic trap.

E. Doppler-Sensitive 1S-2S Spectrum

≈

∼

In contrast to the Doppler-free excitation spectrum,
the Doppler-sensitive spectrum in principle reﬂects the
ﬁnite momentum spread in the condensate as well as the
mean ﬁeld eﬀects. The relevant momentum spread is
given by the uncertainty principle and is
¯h/δz where
5 mm is the length of the condensate along the
δz
laser propagation axis. However, in the hydrogen ex-
periment the cold collision frequency shift (
1 MHz)
dominates over the Doppler-broadening in the spectrum
100 Hz.) We can thus neglect Doppler-
(¯hk0/2πm δz
broadening, which is equivalent to neglecting the spatial
variation of the BEC wave function in any transition ma-
trix elements. In this regime it is possible to modify the
derivation of the WKB and static phase approximations
[27,28,30,29] to calculate the Doppler-sensitive spectrum.
We rewrite the Doppler-sensitive Rabi frequency (Eq.

where jl(k0r) is the spherical Bessel function of order l,
and Y m

the Doppler-sensitive laser Hamiltonian can excite atoms

momentum, but with m = 0.

Transitions are to levels with motional energy

The Doppler-sensitive condensate spectrum has the same
shape as the Doppler-free spectrum, but it is shifted to
the blue by photon momentum-recoil. Because ΩDS =
ΩDF /2, the Doppler-sensitive spectrum is half as intense
as the Doppler-free.

FIG. 4. Eﬀective potentials, wave functions and the laser
ﬁeld for Doppler-sensitive excitation of condensate atoms.
The spatial period of the 2S wave function, the laser wave-
length, and the vertical axes for the potentials are not to
scale. The vertical axes for the wave functions and laser ﬁeld
are arbitrary. In the overlap integral for the transition matrix
element (Eq. 29), the only nonzero contribution comes from
the region where the spatial period of the 2S wave function
matches the wavelength of the laser ﬁeld. This is indicated by
the locations of the light vertical lines. As the laser frequency
is changed, the region of wavelength match moves.

III. OTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE
FORMALISM

A. Other Atomic Systems and Excitation Schemes

We have speciﬁcally considered 1S-2S spectroscopy of
hydrogen, but the formalism is more general. For in-
stance, if the ground-excited state interaction were repul-
sive, this would simply modify the eﬀective 2S potential
(Eq. 13) and the form of the motional states excited by
the laser would change. Equations 24 and 32 would still
be accurate for two-photon excitation to a diﬀerent elec-
tronic state when the mean ﬁeld interaction dominates
the spectrum.

In the recently observed rf hyperﬁne spectrum of a
rubidium condensate [33], the lineshape is determined by
mean ﬁeld energy and the diﬀerent magnetic potentials
felt by atoms in the initial and ﬁnal states. The theory
presented here can be modiﬁed to describe this situation
as well.

For Bragg diﬀraction or spectroscopy as performed
in [34,35], atoms remain in the same internal state af-
ter excitation. Particle exchange symmetry of the wave
function modiﬁes the mean ﬁeld interaction energy of
the excited atoms with the atoms remaining in the con-
In terms of the hydrogen levels, 1S, F = 1,
densate.
mf = 1 atoms not in the condensate experience a po-
tential of 8π¯h2a1S−1Sn1S(r)/m. This is to be compared
with the mean ﬁeld potential of 4π¯h2a1S−2Sn1S(r)/m ex-
perienced by 2S particles excited out of the condensate
and 4π¯h2a1S−1Sn1S(r)/m experienced by 1S atoms in
the condensate. In appendix A, the point in the deriva-
tion where the diﬀerence arises is indicated.

B. Doppler Broadening in the Doppler-Sensitive
Spectrum

To derive the Doppler-sensitive 1S-2S spectrum, we
neglected the variation of the condensate wave function,
which is equivalent to neglecting the atomic momentum
spread. This is well justiﬁed for the hydrogen experi-
ment. The eﬀect of small but nonnegligible momentum
is discussed at the end of appendix B. Now we brieﬂy
describe the Doppler-sensitive lineshape when Doppler-
broadening is dominant. The lineshape turns out to be
similar to that which was seen with Bragg spectroscopy
of a Na condensate [35].

When the mean ﬁeld potential can be neglected, the
2S motional wave functions are approximately those of
the simple harmonic oscillator potential produced by the
magnetic trap alone. Because the spatial extent for these
motional states is large compared to δz, in the region of
the condensate the wave functions can be represented as
plane waves labeled by their momenta [36]. The spec-
trum becomes

IV. DISCUSSION

To make the problem analytically tractable, we have
only derived the BEC spectrum for the speciﬁc case of
a spherically symmetric trap. The trap shape does not
appear in the ﬁnal expressions (Eq. 24 and 32), however,
and with reasonable conﬁdence we can extend the results
to any geometry. In the experiment, the trap aspect ratio
is as large as 400 to 1, but the data agrees well with this
theory. The physical picture of the transition occurring
at the classical turning points, and the probabilistic or
local density interpretation of the spectrum also support
the generalization of Eq. 24 and 32 to

Equations 36 and 37 take 4π¯h2δa n1S(r)/m as a local
shift of the transition frequency and ascribe the excita-
tion to a small region in space where the laser is resonant.
This approach is similar to a quasistatic approximation in
standard spectral lineshape theory [28] which neglects the
atomic motion and averages over the distribution of in-
terparticle spacings to ﬁnd the spectrum. Atom pairs at
diﬀerent separations experience diﬀerent frequency shifts
due to atom-atom interactions. This broadens the line.

There are important diﬀerences between the theory
presented here and the quasistatic approximation, how-
ever. For the standard quasistatic treatment to be valid,
the lifetime of the excited state should be shorter than
a collision time [38]. For a condensate, the classical con-
cept of a collision time is inapplicable. We have shown
that Eq. 36 and 37 result from a diﬀerent approxima-
tion: neglecting the slow spatial variation of the BEC
wave function. Also, for the condensate spectrum, one
integrates over atom position in the eﬀective potential,
as opposed to integrating over the distribution of atom-
atom separations. Finally, the BEC spectral broadening
is homogeneous, which is not normally the case when
making the quasistatic approximation.

It is interesting that although the atoms in the con-
densate are delocalized over a region in which the den-
sity varies from it’s maximum value to zero, the rapid
oscillation of the excited state wave function essentially
localizes the transition (Eq. 22 and B9). In this way, the
excitation probes the condensate wave function spatially.
The description of the BEC spectrum developed here
has provided insight into the excitation process and it
is general. We have shown that the formalism of transi-
tions between bound states of the eﬀective potentials can
be used when either the mean ﬁeld or Doppler broad-
ening dominates.
It can describe a variety of excita-
tion schemes such as two-photon Doppler-free or Doppler
sensitive spectroscopy to an excited electronic state, or
Bragg diﬀraction which leaves the atom in the ground
state.

APPENDIX B: WKB AND STATIC PHASE APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE DOPPLER-SENSITIVE
BEC SPECTRUM

In this appendix we calculate the Doppler-sensitive overlap integral, Eq. 29, and simplify Eq. 28. The derivation is

similar to the treatment of [29,30].

The overlap integral we must evaluate is

Because u∆,l and jl are rapidly varying compared to √n it is useful to express u∆,l and jl in phase-amplitude form

through a WKB approximation. We deﬁne the local wave vectors for u∆,l and jl

We have used the fact that

n(r) varies slowly and have dropped rapidly oscillating terms in the integral.

We make the static phase approximation that the overlap integral will only have contributions from the point R∆

where the diﬀerence in the phase factors is stationary. This point is deﬁned by 0 = d

This is essentially identical to Eq. 22 from the calculation of the Doppler-free spectrum.

We expand the diﬀerence in the phases in a Taylor series around R∆ and write the overlap integral as

In the derivation given above, we neglected the variation of the condensate wave function, which is equivalent to
neglecting the atomic momentum spread
¯h/δr, where δr is the r extent of the condensate. When mean ﬁeld eﬀects
dominate the spectrum, but the atomic momentum is not completely negligible, the lineshape will deviate from Eq.

Using the molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation we consider the eﬀects of molecular symmetry
on the ionization of molecules by a strong, linearly polarized laser pulse. Electron angular distri-
butions and total ionization yields are calculated as a function of the relative orientation between
the molecule and the laser polarization. Our studies focus on ethylene (C2H4), benzene (C6H6),
ﬂuorobenzene (C6H5F), and ortho chloroﬂuorobenzene (1,2 C6H4ClF), the molecules representing
four diﬀerent point groups. The results are compared with experiments, when available, and with
the molecular tunneling theory appropriately extended to non-linear polyatomic molecules. Our
investigations show that the orientational dependence of ionization yields is primarily determined
by the nodal surface structure of the molecular orbitals.

INTRODUCTION

Ionization is an ubiquitous process in the interaction
between atoms and molecules and intense laser ﬁelds.
The ejected electron propagates in the combined laser
and Coulomb ﬁeld, and the laser ﬁeld may steer back the
electron and force it to recollide with the parent ion. In
this way, the release of an electron into the laser-dressed
continuum can initiate strong-ﬁeld processes, such as
above threshold ionization, multiple ionization, and high
harmonic generation (see, e.g., Ref. [1] and references
therein). Clearly, the laser ﬁeld only drives the elec-
tron in the direction of the laser polarization vector
and, consequently, rescattering dynamics is typically only
present for linearly polarized laser ﬁelds. The possibility
of rescattering depends not only on the parameters of
the laser. Also the scattering angle with which the elec-
tron leaves the parent ion plays a role. For most atomic
ground states, strong-ﬁeld ionization leads to an outgoing
electronic current in the direction of the linear polariza-
tion of the laser, and hence a recollision is possible after
the ﬁeld has changed its direction. For molecules, how-
ever, it happens, that the molecular symmetry imposes
one or more nodal planes in the ground state wave func-
tion. In such planes the ejection of photoelectrons may
be strongly suppressed [2], causing recollisionally induced
double ionization not to peak for linearly but for ellipti-
cally polarized laser light [3]. It is therefore clear that a
good understanding of the dependence of the initial ion-
ization process upon laser parameters and upon param-
eters characteristic for the system, such as symmetry, is
crucial for the further development and possible practical
utilization of strong-ﬁeld phenomena.

A large number of studies has established that the
laser parameters determining strong-ﬁeld ionization are
the wavelength, the intensity, and the polarization [1, 4,
5, 6, 7]. We note in passing that in the case of few-

cycle laser pulses, the ionization rate and the photoelec-
tron angular distribution also depends critically on the
phase of the carrier frequency with respect to the en-
velope [8]. For atoms the most important system pa-
rameter is the binding energy of the initial state.
In
fact, the simple ADK tunneling model [9], employing
only the laser intensity and the atomic binding energy
as input parameters, provides for many atomic species a
very good description of measured total ionization rates.
Also, the theory referred to as the strong-ﬁeld approx-
imation (SFA) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] has been successful
in modeling atomic ionization including the angular dis-
tribution of the ejected photoelectrons. In this theory,
the ionization takes place from a ﬁeld-free ground state
to a laser-dressed continuum ﬁnal state via the interac-
tion with the lowest-order laser-atom operator.
In the
ﬁnal state, the Coulomb interaction between the electron
and the parent ion is neglected and the electron is de-
scribed by the state of a free electron in the laser ﬁeld –
the so-called Volkov state (see Ref. [15] for a very recent
discussion).

For molecules a few recent studies have shown that
there is an additional system parameter that also strongly
inﬂuences strong-ﬁeld ionization namely the symmetry of
the initial electronic state [2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23]. Modiﬁcations of both the ADK tunneling theory [23]
and the SFA [17] have been introduced to account for the
molecular symmetry. Hereby the two models have pro-
vided results in reasonably agreement with measured ion-
ization rates of molecules. In the molecular ADK (MO-
ADK) theory [23] one expands the asymptotic molecular
ground state wave function in a one-center basis and ap-
plies the atomic tunneling theory to each partial wave.
The atomic SFA is straightforwardly generalized to the
molecular SFA (MO-SFA) by using molecular wave func-
tions. A very appealing feature of MO-SFA is that the
expansion of the molecular wave function in linear combi-

nation of atomic orbitals (LCAO), allows an interpreta-
tion of the spectrum of photoelectrons in terms of inter-
ference from the multi-center molecule; an interpretation
which in the context of single-photon ionization was of-
fered almost 40 years ago [24].

In our previous work [2] we used the molecular strong-
ﬁeld approximation (MO-SFA) in the velocity gauge for-
mulation to illustrate the strong dependence of the pho-
toelectron angular distribution and the total ionization
rates of ethylene and benzene on (i) the orientation be-
tween the molecule and the laser polarization and on (ii)
the symmetry of the electronic wave function. The pur-
pose of the present paper is to give a more thorough dis-
cussion of the inﬂuence of molecular symmetry on strong-
ﬁeld ionization.
In particular, we study four diﬀerent
molecules representing four diﬀerent classes of symmetry
(point groups). We show how a reduction of the molec-
ular symmetry lifts the degeneracy of molecular orbitals
and leads to diﬀerent ionization channels with distinct
features.

More recently, we found that the MO-SFA in the ve-
locity gauge formulation failed to explain orientational
eﬀects in ionization of N2. However, using the length-
gauge to describe the molecule-ﬁeld interaction, results in
good agreement with experiments [16] were obtained [20].
Consequently, in the present work we found it necessary
to employ both gauges and check if the results obtained
are consistent. In addition, we calculate ionization rates
by the MO-ADK tunneling model and compare with the
results from the MO-SFA.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present
a justiﬁcation for using a Hartree-Fock calculation to rep-
resent the electronic ground states of the molecules under
study. In Sec. III, we recall the theory of the MO-SFA
and the MO-ADK tunneling models. In particular, we
present the generalization of the MO-ADK theory [23] to
the case of non-linear polyatomic molecules. In Sec. IV,
we provide details of the calculations and discuss the
choice of basis functions, the choice of nuclear coordi-
nates, and the method for obtaining the ionization rates.
In Sec. V, we present the numerical results comprising a
comparison between the length and the velocity gauge.
We argue that the length gauge gives the better results
and use it together with the MO-ADK model to calculate
ionization rates for each of the four molecules. In Sec. VI,
we conclude and provide an outlook for the future.

II. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE:
HARTREE-FOCK OR BEYOND

In some molecules the inclusion of electron correlations
is necessary in order to predict even qualitatively correct
properties. For example, in N2 the ordering of the or-
bitals obtained from a simple Hartree-Fock (HF) calcu-
lation is not consistent with the observed single-photon
photoelectron spectrum: The calculated highest occu-
pied molecular orbital (HOMO) of N2 is a πu orbital

2

while the HOMO inferred from experiments is a σg or-
bital [25]. When including electron correlations in the
calculations, the correct ordering and ionization energies
are obtained [26]. Another example where the eﬀects of
electron–electron correlation are important is F2 which
is not even bound in a HF treatment.
It is therefore
not surprising that one–electron models have failed in
the attempt of explaining strong-ﬁeld ionization of F2
[17, 23, 27].

In this work, we consider ionization of ethylene and
substituted benzenes. For these systems electron cor-
relation may be safely neglected in the description of
the initial state, since photoionization spectra in the va-
lence region of these molecules consist of clearly sepa-
rated bands which are unambiguously assigned and are
in accordance with Hartree-Fock predictions [28, 29]. In
these systems, each electron occupies an orbital obtained
from a HF calculation and it is an accurate approxima-
tion to describe ionization by the removal of an electron
from an occupied orbital while leaving the ion in an un-
relaxed state. With these approximations, the many–
electron problem translates into the much simpler single–
electron problem. Only ionization from the highest or
next highest occupied molecular orbital (referred to as
HOMO–1) is considered. For ethylene and benzene the
separations between the ﬁrst and second ionization po-
tential are 2.3 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively. In Ref. [30]
it was shown that such large energy diﬀerences led to
a much lower ionization probability from the HOMO–1
than from the HOMO. The separation between the ﬁrst
and second ionization potential is, however, much lower
for the substituted benzenes, approximately 0.4 eV. Ac-
cordingly, we will consider ionization from the HOMO
only for ethylene and the degenerate HOMO of benzene
while for the substituted benzenes we will additionally
include ionization from the HOMO–1.
Ionization from
all other orbitals is neglected.

III. THEORY

In this section, we describe the theories that we apply
for the calculation of the molecular strong-ﬁeld ioniza-
tion. Throughout this work, we ﬁx the nuclei at their
equilibrium positions as determined with the HF theory.

A. Molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation

The molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation (MO-SFA)
[2, 17, 20] is a generalization of the atomic strong-ﬁeld
approximation [10, 11, 12]. For a linearly polarized elec-
tric ﬁeld F (t) = F0 sin (ωt) with associated vector po-
tential A(t) = A0 cos (ωt), A0 = F0/ω, the laser electron
interaction is represented by [atomic units (~ = me =

In either gauge, we utilize the 2π/ω = T periodicity of
the ﬁeld to express the angular diﬀerential, dW/d ˆq, and

tions [20, 31]

conservation also determines the minimum number of

(2π)−3/2 normalized Volkov wave function and Ψ(r, t)
the wave function for the electron in the combined ﬁeld of
the molecule and the laser. Introducing the strong-ﬁeld

We construct the molecular one-electron wave func-
tions as linear combinations of basis functions φij based
on each atom (LCAO-MO), located at the positions Ri.

B. Molecular tunneling theory

The molecular ADK (MO-ADK) tunneling theory
[19, 23] is a generalization of the atomic ADK theory
[9]. In previous works [19, 20, 23] the MO-ADK theory
was applied to diatomic molecules. Here the theory is
generalized to cover also nonlinear polyatomic molecules.
The tunneling theory relies on the assumption that at
any given instants of time the molecule will respond to
the external laser ﬁeld as if it were a static electric ﬁeld.
The rate of ionization in the oscillating ﬁeld may thus be
determined by the time-averaged static rates. Whether
this approach is reasonable or not depends on the value
of the Keldysh parameter γ = √2Eb
1
in the tunneling regime.

[10] with γ

The formulation of a tunneling theory in the case of
molecules is complicated compared to the atomic case by
two related features. Firstly, the presence of multiple nu-
clei within the molecule breaks the spherical symmetry

of the ﬁeld–free system and necessitates a description of
the molecular wave function in terms of a superposition
of partial waves. Secondly, the Euler angles describing
the orientation between the laboratory ﬁxed frame (with
a Z–axis determined by the linear polarization vector of
the external ﬁeld) and the molecular body ﬁxed frame
have to be speciﬁed. Note that we use (X, Y, Z) to la-
bel the laboratory ﬁxed frame of reference and (x, y, z)
to label the body–ﬁxed frame of reference. The tunnel-
ing rate of molecules can be determined once the ﬁeld–
free asymptotic wave function is known. In a body–ﬁxed
frame, labeled by superscript B, this function must follow
the asymptotic Coulomb form

where Zion is the charge of the residual ion and κ is re-
lated to the binding energy, κ = √2Eb. For the tun-
neling process in the DC case, we assume the electric
ﬁeld to point in the positive Z–direction, corresponding
to a situation where tunneling would occur in the nega-
tive Z–direction. Consequently, we need to express the
asymptotic form of the molecular wave function in that
direction. If the body–ﬁxed frame is rotated by the Euler
angles (φ, θ, χ) with respect to the laboratory ﬁxed sys-
tem, the asymptotic form in the laboratory ﬁxed system
of the ﬁeld–free molecular ground state wave function
is expressed through the rotation operator ˆD(φ, θ, χ) as
ΦL
0 (r), where we have used the su-
perscript L to denote the laboratory ﬁxed system. Equa-
tion (10) then leads to the expression

In Eq. (11) the sum over m′ and the correspond-
33].
ing Wigner functions describes the rotation between the
coordinate systems and the sum over l, m is a signature
of the breaking of the spherical symmetry by the molec-
ular system. For linear molecules the projection m of
the electronic angular momentum onto the body–ﬁxed
axis is a good quantum number and, hence, for such sys-
tems there would be no summation over m in Eqs. (10)
and (11) [23]. For later convenience, we note that φ and
χ represent rotations around the space–ﬁxed Z–axis and
the body ﬁxed z–axis, respectively, while θ represents the
angle between the Z and z axes.

From the asymptotic form of Eq. (11), the total ioniza-
tion rate in a static (DC) ﬁeld in the positive Z direction
is calculated as in the atomic case [34, 35, 36], and the
result is

and we see by comparing with Eq. (10) that this simply

corresponds to the substitution Clm →
(13). Note that parity eigenstates, corresponding to in-
version symmetric molecules, contain only even or odd l
states. When the ﬁeld direction is changed Eq. (13) will
either remain invariant or change sign and the DC rate is
thereby left invariant. Contrary, the DC rate will not be
invariant to ﬁeld inversion for states which are not parity
eigenstates. This is also to be expected since the wave
functions in the tunneling regions in the positive and neg-
ative Z direction will be diﬀerent. Under the assumption

IV. CALCULATIONS

A. Basis set

(12)

The Hartree-Fock wave functions for ethylene, ben-
zene, ﬂuorobenzene and o–chloroﬂuorobenzene are calcu-
lated using GAMESS [37] with a standard valence triple
zeta basis set [38]. This basis set contains s and p orbitals
for carbon, ﬂuorine and chlorine while the hydrogen ba-
sis consists only of s orbitals. Since the tunneling rates
and the length gauge MO-SFA rates both rely on the

asymptotic form of the wave function a precise descrip-
tion is needed in this region. This is obtained by adding
an extra diﬀuse s and p basis function. The orbitals of
the molecules considered are odd under reﬂection in their
molecular planes. Thus the LCAO expansion, Eq. (8),
can only include p orbitals orthogonal to the plane. For
example, if we deﬁne the yz plane to coincide with the
molecular plane, the relevant p orbitals are the px or-
bitals.

B. Expansion and asymptotic coeﬃcients

The calculation of the initial molecular ground state
wave function is performed at the equilibrium geome-
try predicted by Hartree–Fock theory. Bond lengths ob-
tained in this way are typically within few pm from ex-
perimental data [39]. The nuclear geometries are shown
in Fig. 1.

Note that we deﬁne the body–ﬁxed z axis to be per-
pendicular to the molecular plane for benzene while it
lies in the molecular plane for the remaining molecules.
Since we want to investigate the inﬂuence of molecu-
lar alignment on the ionization rates, we have chosen
our axes to coincide with the principal axes for each
molecule. Aligned molecules are generated as superpo-
sitions of rotational eigenstates which are most conve-
niently described in this coordinate system [40]. Our def-
initions of coordinates are in accordance with the usual
conventions except for chloroﬂuorobenzene.

The asymptotic form of the orbitals, Eq. (10), is found

by expanding in spherical harmonics

Φ0(r) =

Flm(r)Ylm(ˆr),

(17)

Xl,m

Z

leading to

Flm(r) =

dΩY ∗

lm(ˆr)Φ0(r).

(18)

These functions are then matched to the form Flm(r)
∼
ClmrZion/κ−1e−κr in the asymptotic region whereby the
coeﬃcients Clm are determined. The values of Clm for
the molecules investigated in this work are given in Ta-
ble I. All the orbitals are odd eigenstates of the σyz re-
ﬂection operation and they are additionally chosen purely
real. The projection on the spherical harmonics, Eq. (18),
will then be either purely real (m odd) or purely imagi-
nary (m even). Another consequence of the yz reﬂection
Fl,m(r). In ethylene, ben-
antisymmetry is Fl,−m(r) =
zene and ﬂuorobenzene our orbitals are additionally be
eigenstates of the σxz reﬂection operation. If the wave
function is an even (odd) eigenstate of the σxz reﬂection
operation then only the real, m odd, (imaginary, m even)
radial functions will occur.

−

Since the basis functions we use are Gaussian and the
correct asymptotic form to which we ﬁt, is exponential,
we cannot expect a precise ﬁt all the way to inﬁnity.

and HOMO–1 for ﬂuorobenzene respectively and (e) and
(f) HOMO and HOMO–1 for 1,2-chloroﬂuorobenzene respec-
tively. The origins of the coordinate systems are in the center–
of–mass. For later convenience we see that all the orbitals
contain nodal planes in the molecular plane. The HOMOs of
ﬂuorobenzene and 1,2-chloroﬂuorobenzene, (d) and (f), con-
tain nodal surfaces which are approximately parallel to the xy
plane. The HOMO–1 of ﬂuorobenzene contains a nodal plane
in the xz plane while the HOMO–1 of 1,2-chloroﬂuorobenzene
contains a nodal suface which is almost in the xz plane. The
relation between the body–ﬁxed axes shown in the ﬁgures and
the laboratory–ﬁxed axes is discussed in Sec. III B.

Accordingly, we have adjusted the range of asymptotic
ﬁtting to start well outside the nuclear positions and is
limited such that the radial functions Flm(r) of Eq. (18)

obtained accurate results by this procedure.

C. Simpliﬁcations in the length gauge

In the length gauge MO-SFA the transition amplitude,
will only depend on the asymptotic behavior of the coor-
dinate space wave function [20, 31].

When we have determined the angular coeﬃcients Clm
we may simply use the Fourier transform of Eq. (11) in
the length gauge transition amplitude of Eq. (5). The

with Qn(t) = qn +A(t). This formula is particularly use-
ful when we want to consider many diﬀerent molecular
orientations, since the integrals in Eq. (21) are indepen-
dent of molecular orientation. Firstly, we need to calcu-
late all the integrals once for each l and m′ at some lab
ﬁxed momentum qn. Then we can easily get the transi-
tion amplitude at the same lab ﬁxed momentum for all

orientations (φ, θ, χ) by multiplication with the appro-
priate Wigner functions. We have checked this method
against calculations with the fully numeric Fourier trans-
forms applied in Eq. (5) and we ﬁnd agreement within
. 20% in the ﬁnal rates.

In closing this section, we note that with the above sim-
pliﬁcations of the length gauge MO–SFA, the only non–
trivial dependency on electronic structure of the MO–
SFA LG and the MO–ADK theory is through the Clm
expansion coeﬃcients.

Ion signal

The ionization rates in Eqs. (4) and (14) depend on
the instantaneous amplitude of the ﬁeld and the molec-
ular orientation described by the Euler angles (φ, θ, χ).
We only consider linearly polarized light and hence the
results are independent of φ, the angle of rotation around
the polarization vector. For a Gaussian laser beam with a
Gaussian temporal proﬁle with FWHM τ , the amplitude

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To justify the use of the approximate theories discussed
in Sec. III, we ﬁrst calculate the intensity dependent
ion signal for ethylene and benzene and compare with
experimental data. Previous studies using the velocity
gauge MO-SFA have shown that the absence of the ﬁ-
nal state Coulomb interaction in this model will under-
estimate the ionization rates. To take this interaction
into account a correction factor C(v)
Coul = (κ3/F0)2Zion/κ
was proposed [17]. In our velocity gauge calculations, we
adopt this correction factor. A recent study on N2 [20] re-
vealed that the eﬀect of the Coulomb interaction is much
smaller with the length gauge MO-SFA. The explanation
is that the combined laser-ion interaction with the elec-
tron is already present through the factor ˜Φ0(qn + A(t))
in Eq. (5) and also in the length gauge, the ionization
occurs at large distances from the core. In this spatial re-
gion, the Coulomb interaction is already suppressed com-
pared to the electron–laser interaction. Below we demon-
strate that the length gauge MO-SFA without any extra
Coulomb correction factor reproduces experimental ion
signals of C2H4 and C6H6.

For direct comparison of results obtained by MO-SFA
and MO-ADK theories with the experimental data it is
necessary to express the total rate of ionization as the
sum of rates leading to unresolved ﬁnal states. This
means that the rates in Eqs. (3) and (4) must be multi-
plied by the number of electrons which occupy the active
orbital, i.e., 4 for the degenerate HOMO of benzene and
2 for the non–degenerate closed shell orbitals.

Figures 2 and 3 show theoretical results and experi-
mental data of the ion signal versus peak intensity for
experiments on ethylene and benzene, respectively. The
calculations are the MO-ADK, the length gauge MO-SFA
(MO-SFA LG) and the velocity gauge MO-SFA (MO-SFA
VG). Following the discussion in Sec. IV D, we normalize
the results of each calculation to match the experimental
data at high intensities. The ﬁgures show that the MO-
SFA LG predicts results in excellent agreement with both
the ethylene and the benzene experimental data. The
Coulomb corrected MO-SFA VG results ﬁt the data rea-
sonably well, while we ﬁnd a poor agreement between the
MO-ADK model and experiments. We explain this lat-
ter discrepancy by the fact that the intensities considered
here do not strictly correspond to the tunneling regime.
Typical values of the Keldysh parameter are 3.0 (2.8) for
ethylene (benzene) at I0 = 1013 Wcm−2 and 0.94 (0.88)
at I0 = 1014 Wcm−2. We note that despite both MO-
SFA models are in agreement with these total ion-yield
experiments, a recent study on orientational-dependent
ionization from N2 showed that the length gauge formu-
lation is the better choice [20].

A. Ethylene

The main conclusion from our earlier velocity gauge
work on ethylene [2] was that the angular distributions
of photoelectrons are very sensitive to the relative orien-
tation between the laser polarization and the molecule.
This could be interpreted as an eﬀect of the nodal plane
structure of the HOMO. Electron emission was found to

be impossible in the directions of the molecular plane
which led to a suppression of the total ionization rate
when the molecular plane coincided with the polariza-
tion vector.

We ﬁrst present polar plots of angular diﬀerential ion-
ization rates using the length gauge MO-SFA (Fig. 4) and
the Coulomb corrected velocity gauge MO-SFA (Fig. 5)
for diﬀerent molecular orientations, speciﬁed by the an-
gle θ between the polarization and the body–ﬁxed z axis
deﬁned in Fig. 1 (a). Our primary purpose of these cal-
culations is to check if the results in the two gauges are
compatible. From Figs. 4 and 5 we see that both models
predict an increase in the ionization rate as the polar an-
gle θ increases. When the molecular plane coincides with
the polarization, the rates are strongly suppressed and in
both models no electron emission is observed along the
polarization direction.
In the velocity gauge this phe-
nomenon was explained by the presence of a nodal plane
in the molecular plane [2]. There is a one–to–one corre-
spondence between nodal planes in coordinate space and
momentum space. Thus, the velocity gauge transition
amplitude, Eq. (6), vanishes at momenta which lie in the
nodal plane. This is indeed what we observe in Fig. 5.
In the length gauge transition amplitude, Eq. (5), the
momentum wave function is not evaluated at the actual
outgoing momentum but at a time–dependent displaced
momentum qn + A(t). This has the consequence that
even though qn lies in the nodal plane the transition am-
plitude can be nonzero. Only when qn and A(t) both lie
in the nodal plane (θ = 0◦) the transition amplitude is

Figure 5: Similar to Fig. 4 but calculated in velocity gauge.

zero. This argument is general for molecules which ion-
ize from orbitals containing nodal planes. In both gauges
the ionization rate is thus expected to be suppressed for
molecular orientations with the polarization coinciding
with a nodal plane. This leads to the qualitative agree-
ment in the two gauges. For molecules without planar
nodal surfaces no such suppressions can a priori be ex-
pected for any geometry. Based on previous work on
strong–ﬁeld ionization of N2 [20] and detachment of neg-
ative ions [31, 45] we judge that the length gauge is the
proper choice of gauge to use in the strong–ﬁeld approx-
imation. Accordingly, in the calculations below we will
only use the length gauge MO-SFA.

Currently, angle resolved photoelectron measurements
on aligned molecules have not been performed. How-
ever, the ﬁrst measurements of total ion yields on aligned
molecules have been reported [16]. In order to make pre-
diction on these types of experiments we show in Fig. 6
the total ion yield as a function of molecular orientation
using (a) the MO-SFA LG model and (b) the MO-ADK
model. The ﬁgure shows the yields which would be mea-
sured if all molecules were oriented according to the Euler
angles speciﬁed. Explicitly, we show the signals as a func-
tion of the polar angle θ for two speciﬁc χ angles with
all signals being normalized to the θ = 0◦ geometry. We
recall that θ = 0◦ for the molecular plane parallel with
the linear polarization, and θ = 90◦ for the perpendicu-
lar geometry. In experiments, utilizing linearly polarized
light pulses for the alignment, the molecular axis with
largest polarizability is aligned along the polarization di-
rection [46] (the C–C axis for ethylene). In this case the
molecule is free to rotate around its body–ﬁxed z axis
and measured signals are thus a result of an average over
the χ angle. Correspondingly, we have calculated the χ
averaged signal too.

Figure 6 (a) shows, in accordance with Fig. 4, a large
increase in the ion yield with increasing polar angle for
χ = 0◦ as well as for the χ averaged result. For χ = 90◦
the polarization vector is always directed in the molec-
ular plane and by the argument given above the yield
is generally much lower. In Fig. 6 (b) we see much the
same trend for the MO-ADK model with the χ = 90◦
geometries being suppressed compared with their χ = 0◦
counterparts. Contrary to the results from the MO-SFA
LG model, the yield is not maximized when polarization
is perpendicular to the plane for χ = 0◦ and χ aver-
aged. The theories disagree because the tunneling rate is
derived under the assumption that the electron emission
only occurs close to the space–ﬁxed Z axis determined by
the linear polarization direction of the ﬁeld. Hence, the
MO-ADK rates reﬂect only the situation in this spatial
region. For atoms, this is a reasonable assumption since
the initial spherical symmetric potential will be aﬀected
most strongly in this direction and the potential barrier
which arises from the combined ﬁeld and atomic potential
will then be minimized. For molecules, the initial poten-
tial is more complicated and the potential barrier can be
minimized in other directions. Important contributions
to the ion yield are thereby not taken into account and
this is the reason why the results of the theories do not
agree.

Since the tunneling ionization occurs close to the Z
axis by assumption, the interpretation of the MO-ADK
results can be made by analyzing the electron distribu-
tion in this direction. Previously, it was noted that the
tunneling rate is largest when the initial electronic cloud
is aligned with the ﬁeld direction [23]. In Fig. 7 (a) we
show a contour plot of the HOMO in the body ﬁxed xz
plane. When the ﬁeld vector lies in this plane the geom-
etry corresponds to χ = 0◦ and with vertical and hori-
zontal directions corresponding to θ = 0◦ and θ = 90◦,

θ = 50◦ and θ = 90◦ (Fig. 7 (b)). We clearly see that the
electron density is largest for θ = 50◦ at large distances.
The minimum around θ = 90◦ is also present in Fig. 6
(b) for the χ averaged yields.

B. Benzene

Benzene is a symmetric top molecule and hence it can
only be aligned in the molecular plane [46] while it will
be free to rotate around the body–ﬁxed z axis (see Fig. 1
(b)). Thus only χ averaged signals as shown in Fig. 8 can
be measured. We choose to present our calculated sig-
nals as a function of the angle, Θ, between the molecular
plane and the polarization. Note that this angle is related
to the usual Euler angle through the relation Θ = 90◦
θ
where θ is the polar angle between the Z–axis and the
moleular plane in the frame deﬁned in Fig. 1. This choice
of data representation is convenient since a comparison
with benzene derivatives like ﬂuorobenzene and chloroﬂu-
orobenzene can be made more directly (Secs. V C and
V D). In Fig. 8 we see that the MO–SFA LG model pre-
dicts the maximum yields at Θ = 42◦ and Θ = 138◦
while the MO–ADK model predicts maximum yields at
Θ = 33◦ and Θ = 147◦. In both models the yield is min-
imized at Θ = 0◦, 90◦ and 180◦. These ﬁndings are in

we ﬁnd a somewhat larger modulation in the orienta-

When one hydrogen atom in benzene is replaced by a
ﬂuorine atom, the six–fold rotational symmetry is broken
and consequently the degeneracy of the HOMO is lifted.
The doubly degenerate HOMO of benzene splits up in
two components with the ionization potentials 9.35 eV
and 9.75 eV. This energy diﬀerence is small compared
with the energy separations to the other occupied orbitals
and we will thus consider ionization from both orbitals.
Using the MO-SFA LG model, we present in Fig. 9 (a)–
(c) the ion yields which originate from (a) the HOMO, (b)
the second highest occupied orbital (HOMO–1) and (c)
the integral yield from both channels. The ﬁgures 9 (d)–
(f) contain equivalent results from the MO-ADK model.
We ﬁnd that the signals from both orbitals contribute
signiﬁcantly to the total signal and depending on the ge-
ometry, the contribution from either one will dominate.
The relative importance between the ionization channels
at a given geometry can be understood as a consequence
of the symmetries of the orbitals.

−

Due to the C2v symmetry of ﬂuorobenzene the orbitals
are eigenstates of the xz reﬂection operator with eigen-
values +1 (even) or
1 (odd). The reﬂection symmetry
of an orbital is indicated by the subscript 1 for the even
states and 2 for the odd states. The HOMO of ﬂuo-
robenzene is a b1 orbital, Fig. 1 (c), while the HOMO–1
is an a2 orbital, Fig. 1 (d). Both orbitals are odd with
respect to reﬂections in the molecular (yz) plane. Simi-
lar to ethylene, ionization of ﬂuorobenzene is suppressed
when χ = 90◦ compared with the χ average since the

tion from the highest occupied orbitals of ﬂuorobenzene using

tails on the laser pulse and legends.

molecular plane is a nodal plane for both active orbitals.
The b1 orbital contains a non–planar nodal surface which
is approximately parallel to the xy plane. When θ = 90◦
the polarization is accordingly nearly parallel to this sur-
face and we ﬁnd the yield from the HOMO to be mini-
mized around θ = 90◦. The a2 orbital is odd under the
xz reﬂection and thus it contains a nodal plane in the
xz plane. When the polarization is parallel to this plane
(χ = 0◦) we also ﬁnd suppression of the ionization sig-
nal. In all cases we ﬁnd qualitative agreement between
the MO-SFA LG and MO-ADK results. In order to dis-
cuss the eﬀect of the substitution of hydrogen with ﬂu-
orine we note that the angles Θ for benzene and θ with
χ = 0◦ for ﬂuorobenzene both describe the angle between
the respective molecular planes and the polarization. It
is thus relevant to compare the curve in Fig. 8 with the
dashed curve in Fig. 9. In both theories we ﬁnd that the
total yield for ﬂuorobenzene is slightly more suppressed
around θ = 90◦ than for benzene when it is compared
with the maximum yields around 45 degrees (MO-SFA
LG) and 30 degrees (MO-ADK).

Figure 10: Similar to Fig. 9 but for chloroﬂuorobenzene.

D. Chloroﬂuorobenzene

In Fig. 10 we present the series of graphs for chlo-
roﬂuorobenzene equivalent to the ﬂuorobenzene results
of Fig. 9. The ionization potentials that correspond to
the two highest occupied orbitals are 9.37 eV and 9.80 eV,
meaning that the energy diﬀerence between the HOMO
and the HOMO–1 is 0.43 eV [47].

The molecular symmetry is reduced to contain only
the reﬂection in the molecular plane as a symmetry op-
eration (Cs point group) and, consequently, planar nodal
surfaces can only lie in this plane. However, the two
active orbitals of chloroﬂuorobenzene bear some similar-
ities with their counterparts in ﬂuorobenzene and thus
our qualitative predictions will also be similar. The sim-
ilar nodal surface structures can be seen by comparison
of Figs. 1 (c)–(d) with Figs. 1 (e)–(f). The HOMO con-
tains a nodal surface approximately parallel to the xy
plane and the HOMO–1 contains a nodal surface approxi-
mately parallel to the xz plane. The similarities between
the orbitals can be further exploited by comparing the
asymptotic coeﬃcients which are given in table I.

When we compare Figs. 9 and 10 we do indeed ﬁnd
alike behaviour. For the second highest orbital the sup-
pression at χ = 0◦ is now less pronounced. We can ex-

11

plain this phenomenon by the fact that the polarization
is not parallel to a nodal plane but only approximately
parallel to a nodal surface.

The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the MO-SFA
LG and the MO-ADK model is found at χ = 90◦. Here
the molecular plane lies parallel to the polarization and
the angle θ determines how the molecule is rotated in this
plane. In the MO-SFA LG model the total yield is min-
imized when θ > 90◦ which corresponds to a geometry
where the chlorine atom is directed along the polariza-
tion vector. In the MO-ADK model the minimum yield
is found at θ < 90◦ where the ﬂuorine atom is directed
along the polarization vector. We expect that this dis-
crepancy arises from the fact that the tunneling theory
only accounts for ionization in a narrow cylinder along
the polarization direction of the ﬁeld, as it is discussed in
Sec. V A, and thus the MO-SFA LG model predicts the
more accurate results.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In the present work, we have given a detailed account
of the MO-SFA in the length gauge formulation, and we
have presented the MO-ADK tunneling theory for non-
linear polyatomic molecules. We have discussed the va-
lidity of the present eﬀective single-electron models, and
we have applied them to molecular systems where we ex-
pect the approach to be well justiﬁed. Indeed a compari-
son of our theoretical results with experimental ion-signal
data for ethylene and benzene showed very good agree-
ment, in particular in the length gauge formulation of the
molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation.

We have presented a detailed study of the characteris-
tics of orientational-dependent ionization signals for ethy-
lene, benzene, ﬂuorobenzene, and chloroﬂuorobenzene,
and thus covered systems with D2h, D6h, C2v, and Cs
point group symmetries. Our calculations of angular dif-
ferential rates for ethylene showed that the distributions
are largely determined by the nodal plane structure, and
the comparison of predictions of the MO-ADK and the
MO-SFA results for the orientational dependent ion sig-
nal for ethylene illustrated the shortcoming of the for-
mer model in accounting for situations where the ioniza-
tion is peaked in other directions than along the polar-
ization direction. The comparison of the orientational-
dependent ion signals for the four diﬀerent molecules
showed that it is in general the nodal plane surfaces that
determine the structure in the ionization yields. The
point group of the molecules, although related, plays a
less important role. An interesting feature, however, as-
sociated with the reduction in the point group symme-
try is the lift of the degeneracy in the HOMO as we go
from benzene to the substituted benzene molecules. In
ﬂuorobenzene and chloroﬂuorobenzene the energy diﬀer-
ence between the HOMO and the HOMO–1 is compa-
rably small, and one needs to consider ionization from
both orbitals. The conclusions for the HOMO–1 with

respect to the importance of nodal surfaces remain un-
changed. If one, on the other hand, speculates about pos-
sible experimental studies aiming at the separation and
unique identiﬁcation of HOMO and HOMO–1 dynamics,
respectively, we propose to turn to a study of the pho-
toelectron spectrum or above-threshold-ionization (ATI)

lead to the stronger peaks. This eﬀect is of course absent
in benzene. Beyond the ﬁxed–nuclei approximation, the
ATI peaks will broaden due to coupling with the rovibra-
tional degrees of freedom, and the diﬀerent series may be
impossible to distinguish. Whether this happens will be
a study for the future.

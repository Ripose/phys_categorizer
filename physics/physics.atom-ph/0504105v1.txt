Abstract

In sudden perturbation approximation, the probability of the shake-up process accompanying

inner-shell ionization is calculated for the isoelectronic sequences of Li-, Na- and K-like ions

in the ground and excited np and nd states. Numerical solutions of Hartree-Fock equations

and hydrogen-like radial orbitals are used. Very large diﬀerences between the results of both

approximations for all ions and strong dependences on ion charge are obtained at the beginning

of the isoelectronic sequences.

PACS: 34.80.Hd

Keywords: Auger decay and inner-shell excitation or ionization

1. Introduction

A shake process accompanies inner-shell ionization of atoms and ions.

It usually eﬀects

photoelectron [1, 2] and Auger electron [3, 4, 5] spectra.

In the case of shake-up or shake-

oﬀ process, it describes the excitation [6] or ionization [7] of the second electron, respectively.

The shake probability describes the relaxation of passive electrons and is also important for

the single electron ionization cross section.

It was obtained by Kupliauskien˙e [8, 9, 10] that

the shake probability should be taken into account even in the case of inner-shell ionization

when spectator electrons saved their initial states. Then it describes the probability of spectator

electrons to stay in their initial states.

A strong increase of the relative intensity of shake-up satellites in the inner-shell photoioniza-

tion of excited Na atoms [2] was explained by the change of the localization of valence electron

in the ﬁnal state with respect to that in the inital state [11, 8, 9]. Very strong dependence of the

calculated inner-shell ionization cross sections of alkaline atoms on the excited valence electron

state was noticed not only in the case of photoionization [8, 9, 12] but also for the ionization of

atoms by electrons [13, 14, 15]. For neutral atoms and singly charged ions of the second and third

rows, the probability of shake process accompanying inner-shell ionization was calculated in [16],

and very strong dependence on valence electron state was obtained. Enormous diﬀerences were

found for low excited ns and np states between shake probabilities that were calculated using

numerical solutions of Hartree-Fock equations (HF) and hydrogen-like (H-like) radial orbitals

[16]. A simple two-parameter interpolation function for Z-dependences of shake-up probabilities

per electron was presented by Kochur et al [17] for atoms in the ground state.

The aim of the present work is the investigation of the dependence of shake probability for

Li-, Na- and K-like ions on the ion charge and the state of valence electron because of the very

strong sensitivity of the inner-shell ionization cross sections of Li-, Na- and K-like atoms on the

valence electron state [8, 9, 12, 15]. The regularities of the shake probability passing from atoms

to highly charged ions of these isoelectronic sequences are investigated.

The calculated shake probabilities can be used for searching strong relaxation eﬀects in

processes dealing with inner-shell ionization of excited atoms and ions by photons and electrons

as well as for the Auger decay calculations in sudden perturbation approximation.

2. Description of calculations

The ionizing transition

AN +(nl4l+2n′l′

) + α → A(N +1)+(nl4l+1n′′l′

) + e−

(1)

is investigated in the present work. Here nl =1s,2p,3p for Li-, Na- and K-like ions, respectively,
n′ = n + 1 for Li- and Na-like ions, n′ = 4 for s- and p-electrons and n′ = 3, 4 for d-electrons of
K-like ions, l′ = 0, 1, 2, n′′ = n′, n′ + 1, N is the charge of an ion, and α stands for a particle or

photon.

The shake probability can be expressed as:

P (i′

→ f ) = |hi′

|f i|2

(2)

where the wave function hi′| describes the ion in the intermediate state following ionization, in

which spectator electrons remain in their initial states, with the radial orbitals of an atom, and

|f i is the wave function of an ion in the ﬁnal state.

The calculations of shake probabilities (2) have been performed by using both numerical

solutions of HF equations [18] obtained in the average-term approximation and hydrogen-like

radial orbitals with eﬀective nuclear charge Z = N + 1 and Z = N + 2 for ions in the initial and

ﬁnal states of the valence electron, respectively.

2. Results and discussion

The shake probabilities for single electron ionization (SPI) and shake-up (SPS) transition
were calculated for Li-, Na- and K-like ions in the conﬁgurations nl4l+2n′l′, l′ = 0, 1, 2, n′ = n+1
for l′ = 0, 1, and n′ = n + 2 for Li-, n′ = n + 1 for Na- and n′ = n, n + 1 for K-like isoelectronic
sequences in the case of d-electron. The ﬁnal state of the ionized ions is n′′ = n′ + 1, n′ + 2.

The values of the shake probabilities calculated by using both HF and H-like radial orbitals

are presented in Fig. 1–2 for Li- and Na-like ions, respectively, and Table 1 for K-like ions.

The values of shake probabilities for d-electrons calculated with H-like radial orbitals are not

displayed in Fig. 1–2 because they are very close to those of HF approximation for Li- and

Na-like ions.

The results of Fig. 1–2 and Table 1 demonstrate that SPI are smaller for d-electrons than

those of s- and p-electrons. They increase with the decrease of the orbital quantum number
from l′ = 2 down to l′ = 0. This tendency is independent of the charge of an ion. The values

of SPI are much smaller than those at the beginning of all sequences investigated but rapidly

increase up to one with growing ion charge N = 9, N = 8 and N = 6 for Li-, Na- and K-like

At the beginning of each sequence under investigation the values of SPS are much larger

than zero and decrease with increasing ion charge. The values of SPS become close to zero for

ion charge a little less than the values of SPI which become close to one, i.e. 8, 7, and 5 for Li-,

Na- and K-like ions, respectively. Thus, the values of SPS decrease more rapidly than those of

ions, respectively.

SPI increase.

The values both of SPI and SPS calculated by using H-like radial orbitals with eﬀective ion

charge diﬀer very much from those of HF calculation not only at the beginning of isoelectronic

sequences but also for highly charged ions. They are similar to each other only for d-electrons

in the case of Li- and Na-like ions. In the case of Li-like ions, the diﬀerences between the results

of both approximations are less in comparison with those of Na- and K-like ions. In the case of

K-like ions, the H-like calculations can not be used for the evaluations of shake probabilities even

for highly charged ions (see table 1). The results of Table 1 show that the diﬀerences between

3

the values calculated with HF and H-like orbitals reach several times or even an order for both

SPI and SPS probabilities.

Calculated values of the ratios of SPS and SPI for Li-, Na- and K-like isoelectronic sequences

are presented in Fig. 3. Here white points in black background stand for the experimental ratios

of shake-up and single electron photoionization cross sections in the case of Li [19], Na [2] and K

[1] atoms. Experimental values of the ratio are chosen for large photon energies where sudden

perturbation approximation is valid.

The results from Fig. 3 show that the agreement between calculated ratios of shake proba-

bilities and measured shake-up and single electron photoionization cross sections is good. The

values of the rations decrease with increasing ion charge. The ratios for s- and p-electrons de-

crease while the number of core electrons increases. But the ratios for d-electrons in the case

of K-like ions are larger than those of Na- and Li-like sequences. The ratios are larger at the

beginning of the sequences, however, their decrease is more rapid for Li-like ions than for K-like

ions.

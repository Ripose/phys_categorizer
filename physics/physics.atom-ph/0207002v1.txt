We present an extensive study of the static and dynamic
properties of systems of spin-polarized tritium atoms. In par-
ticular, we calculate the two-body |F, mF i = |0, 0i s-wave
scattering length and show that it can be manipulated via a
Feshbach resonance at a ﬁeld strength of about 870 G. Such
a resonance might be exploited to make and control a Bose-
Einstein condensate of tritium in the |0, 0i state. It is further
shown that the quartet tritium trimer is the only bound hy-
drogen isotope and that its single vibrational bound state is a
Borromean state. The ground state properties of larger spin-
polarized tritium clusters are also presented and compared
with those of helium clusters.

In 1976 [1], Stwalley and Nosanow suggested, based on
statistical arguments, that the system of spin-polarized
bosonic tritium atoms behaves “very much like 4He”. To
the best of our knowledge, their arguments have not yet
been tested by a microscopic quantum mechanical treat-
ment. A detailed theoretical study of spin-polarized tri-
tium systems, namely spin-polarized atomic tritium clus-
ters and optically-pumped tritium condensates, is the ob-
In this Letter, we present

results for both structural and scattering properties of
tritium dimers, trimers, and clusters.

Pioneering experimental studies of the lowest quartet
state of spin-polarized atomic trimers have been pursued
recently for sodium and potassium [2]. Study of these
trimers, which were prepared on the surface of large 4He
clusters, revealed that three-body eﬀects are surprisingly
important [3]. We are not aware, though, of any ex-
perimental or theoretical studies of larger spin-polarized
atomic cluster systems. Bosonic helium systems — i.e.
liquid bulk 4He, two-dimensional 4He ﬁlms, and ﬁnite size
4HeN clusters [4] — have, of course, been studied exten-
sively. This Letter thus presents the ﬁrst predictions for
spin-polarized atomic clusters. In particular, we charac-
terize spin-polarized tritium clusters [in the following de-
noted by (T↑)N ] with up to N = 40 tritium atoms, and
compare their energetic and structural properties with
those of bosonic 4HeN clusters. We hope that this study
will stimulate further experimental work. Of particular
interest is the lowest quartet state of the tritium trimer,
which we predict to be a Borromean or halo state, and
tritium cluster formation in the presence of an external
magnetic ﬁeld.

We also point out the possibility for creating an

optically-pumped gaseous tritium condensate. Bose-
Einstein condensates (BECs) are, to ﬁrst order, well
characterized by the two-body s-wave scattering length
between two atoms.
It will be shown below that the
triplet two-body s-wave scattering length at of two tri-
tium atoms is large and negative, implying an unstable
condensate of spin-polarized tritium atoms. We ﬁnd,
though, that there is an unusually broad Feshbach reso-
nance [5] for two high-ﬁeld-seeking, |F, mF i = |0, 0i tri-
tium atoms (F denotes the total angular momentum, and
mF the magnetic quantum number of this state).

While condensation of atomic hydrogen was realized
experimentally in 1998 [6], it was a diﬃcult experiment
— at least in part because of hydrogen’s small triplet
scattering length that limits the utility of evaporative
cooling. Nevertheless, owing to hydrogen’s simplicity,
it remains an important species to study. For instance,
properties such as the interatomic potential and spin re-
laxation rates can be obtained theoretically from ﬁrst
principles. Unfortunately, we ﬁnd no Feshbach resonance
at reasonable ﬁeld strengths for hydrogen. Thus, the res-
onance for tritium may permit faster condensation of a
hydrogen-like atom, and allow for the formation of a sta-
ble BEC of tritium atoms with controllable properties in
an optical dipole trap [7]. Formation of such a tritium
condensate should enhance the lively interplay between
theory and experiment.

The behaviour of atomic tritium clusters and conden-
sates is primarily determined by the two-body interaction
potential for two tritium atoms, which is identical to that
for two H or D atoms, except for the isotope-dependent
adiabatic correction. Since there are only two electrons,
these dimers are among the few for which highly accu-
rate ab initio potentials are available. In the following, we
concentrate on the singlet ground state (S = 0, X 1Σ+
g ),
and on the triplet ground state (S = 1, b3Σ+
u ) of the
tritium dimer.

To construct the two-body S = 0 and S = 1 Born-
Oppenheimer interaction potentials for hydrogen and its
heavier isotopes, highly accurate ab initio data for the
short range part [8] that incorporate the mass-dependent
adiabatic correction are connected smoothly with an
analytical expression describing the long-range behav-
ior [9–11]. This procedure results in six potential curves
describing H2, D2, and T2 in their S = 0 and S = 1
states, respectively, which are then used in the radial
Schr¨odinger equation describing the relative motion of a
particle with reduced mass m/2. The mass dependence

1

of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths has been dis-
cussed extensively in the literature [12,13]. Here, we esti-
mate the uncertainty of our two-body scattering observ-
ables by solving the radial Schr¨odinger equation using
both the reduced atomic mass and the reduced nuclear
mass for each two-body potential described above.

FIG. 1. Tritium dimer triplet b3Σ+

u potential (solid line)
together with the He dimer potential (dotted line) as a func-
tion of the interparticle distance r. The inset compares the
tritium dimer triplet potential (S = 1, solid line) with the
tritium dimer singlet ground state potential (S = 0, dashed
line). Note the diﬀerent vertical scales of the main ﬁgure and
the inset.

Figure 1 compares the (T↑)2 potential (solid line) with
the similarly shallow He2 ground state potential, LM2M2
from Aziz and Slaman [14] (dotted line). The T↑ dimer
and the He dimer potentials have a well depth of De =
−4.6cm−1 and −7.6cm−1, respectively. Note that on the
scale shown in Fig. 1, the H↑ and D↑ dimer potentials
would be indistinguishable from the T↑ dimer potential.
The minimum of the (T↑)2 potential lies at a signiﬁcantly
larger interparticle distance (re = 7.8a.u.) than for the
He dimer (re = 5.6a.u.). Given the lighter mass of the
tritium atom (m = 5496.9a.u.) compared to that of the
4He atom (m = 7296.3a.u.), it is not surprising that the
T↑ dimer is not bound, even though the tritium van der
is larger than that for
Waals coeﬃcient C6 = 6.499a.u.
He, C6 = 1.367a.u. (recall that the 4He dimer binding
energy is only −9.1 × 10−4cm−1 [15]). For comparison,
the inset of Fig. 1 shows the tritium triplet potential
(solid line) together with the tritium singlet potential
(dashed line). The singlet curve is almost four orders of
magnitude deeper than the triplet curve and supports 27
vibrational s-wave bound states.

In agreement with values tabulated in the litera-
ture [12], we calculate the two-body s-wave triplet scat-
tering lengths at for (H↑)2 to be at = 1.33a.u. [1.33a.u.],
and for (D↑)2 to be −6.89a.u. [−6.88a.u.], using the re-
duced atomic [reduced nuclear] mass. From symmetry
considerations, the s-wave scattering length for (D↑)2 is
not an observable, and is given here for diagnostic pur-
poses only. For tritium, we predict a positive singlet scat-
tering length, as = 34.6a.u. [35.8a.u.], and a large nega-

tive s-wave scattering length, at = −82.1a.u. [−81.9a.u.].
The T↑ dimer does not possess a bound state, but this
large negative at indicates that it is only “slightly short
of binding”.

Despite the fact that the tritium triplet scattering
length is negative — implying an unstable condensate
— it may be possible to form a stable tritium condensate
utilizing a Feshbach resonance. Coupled-channel scatter-
ing calculations that couple the singlet and triplet sub-
spaces reveal such a Feshbach resonance, i.e. a diverging
scattering length for two atoms characterized by quan-
tum numbers F and mF , as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength. The coupling arises through the atomic
hyperﬁne interaction, and has to be accounted for by
an eﬀective two-atom Hamiltonian [16]. Feshbach reso-
nances have been observed experimentally for 23Na and
85Rb [5] among others. The latter paved the way for a
series of important BEC experiments, some of which en-
ter the large interaction regime [17] while others probe
the collapse regime [18].

FIG. 2. a(00 + 00) scattering length (diamonds; using the
reduced atomic mass in the coupled-channel calculation, see
text) as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength B (dotted
lines are shown to guide the eye). The solid line describes the
behavior for the range B ∈ [400, 1300G] well using the fol-
lowing parameterization, a(00, 00) = aBG(1 − ∆/(B − BR))
with aBG = −37.9a.u., ∆ = −1238G, and BR = 870.8G;
however, the ﬁt is inaccurate at low ﬁelds. Inset: Threshold

The assignment of quantum numbers is approximate, except
for |1, 1i + |1, −1i, which is an exact eigenstate without ad-
mixtures.

We ﬁnd that collisions between two tritium atoms, each
in their |F, mF i = |0, 0i state, results in a scattering
lenth of a(00, 00) = 57a.u.
for zero magnetic
ﬁeld strength B, using the atomic [nuclear] mass. As
B increases, the scattering length a(00 + 00) rises and
eventually goes through inﬁnity across a broad Feshbach
resonance centered at B = 870G [810G] (see Fig. 2). We
also looked for, but could not ﬁnd, a similar resonance for
collisions of hydrogen atoms. Note that our predictions
are not sensitive to a replacement of the atomic mass by
the nuclear mass.

Formation of a tritium condensate in the high-ﬁeld-
seeking |0, 0i state would require some variety of non-
magnetic trap, such as the dipole CO2 laser trap that
has already produced a 87Rb condensate [7]. Since the
electric dipole polarizability of tritium is only 4.5 a.u.,
the 12 W CO2 laser setup of [7] would only produce trap
depths of the order of a few microkelvin. There appears
to be no reason why much stronger CO2 lasers could not
be utilized, however. Realistically, the formation of a
tritium condensate will probably require laser intensities
at least an order of magnitude more intense. The large
magnitude of the zero-ﬁeld scattering length would make
evaporative cooling far more eﬀective than is the case for
spin-polarized hydrogen. Another possible way to cool
the spinless substate of tritium would be to implement
a recent proposal to cool an atomic gas through mag-
netic ﬁeld ramps across a Feshbach resonance [19]. De-
spite these technical diﬃculties to be overcome, recent
improvements in trapping and cooling technology would
appear to make the creation of a tritium condensate a
viable possibility.

To determine the bound state properties of (T↑)N clus-
ters with N > 2, we ﬁrst have to investigate the impor-
tance of non-additive contributions to the many-body in-
teraction potential. Although three-body contributions,
i.e., the Axilrod-Teller term [20] and three-body exchange
terms [21], are signiﬁcant for the hydrogen trimer in its
electronic ground state, they should be less important
for the spin-polarized trimer since the classical atom-
atom equilibrium distance of the quartet trimer is more
than ﬁve times as large as that for the doublet ground
state trimer. Our calculations show that inclusion of the
damped Axilrod-Teller term [22] raises the ground state
energy of the spin-polarized tritium trimer by roughly
1.6%, and that of the larger clusters slightly more, e.g.,
by about 6 % for N = 40. To describe (T↑)N clusters,
we assume in the following a simple pairwise additive
N
i<j V (rij ), where V (r)
potential energy surface, V = P
denotes the triplet b3Σ+
u two-body potential. Conceiv-
ably, a more sophisticated many-body potential energy
surface, which includes eﬀects beyond the two-body po-
tential, could modify our quantitative results somewhat,
but we do not expect qualitative changes.

For the T↑ trimer, we use the adiabatic hyperspher-
ical representation [23].
Including only one adiabatic
channel yields a single bound state with energy −1.60 ×
10−3 cm−1. Coupling 25 adiabatic channels results in
an energy of −3.19 × 10−3 cm−1 with an uncertainty of
10−5 cm−1 and still no excited states. In the limit that an
inﬁnite number of channels are coupled, the bound state
energy becomes exact, so the uncertainty is the result of
including a ﬁnite number of channels. Upon inclusion
of the Axilrod-Teller three-body term, the ground state
energy is raised to −3.14 × 10−3 cm−1 — again with un-
certainty in the last digit. There is thus a single L = 0
bound state for quartet tritium (L is the total orbital an-
gular momentum); no L > 0 bound states are expected

since none exist for the 4He trimer [24].

Since the T↑ dimer is unbound, the T↑ trimer is a
Borromean state [25]. One may then ask: does the
T↑ trimer state have Eﬁmov character [26]? To inves-
tigate this question, we apply a simple quantitative cri-
terion [27], although others exist [28]. If the bound state
disappears when one makes the potential more attrac-
tive (here achieved by simply multiplying the two-body
potential with an overall scaling factor greater than 1),
then the state under investigation is an Eﬁmov state; if
the bound state does not disappear, it is not an Eﬁmov
state. Applying this criterion, our coupled-channel cal-
culations indicate that the bound T↑ trimer state is not
an Eﬁmov state. In short, the T↑ trimer has exactly one
L = 0 bound state, a Borromean state that is highly
diﬀuse spatially.

To calculate the energetics and structural properties of
(T↑)N clusters with up to N = 40 atoms, we employ the
diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) technique [29].
This method solves the time-independent many-body
Schr¨odinger equation essentially exactly, to within a sta-
tistical error. Here, we employ the DMC method with
importance sampling [29], using a descendant weighting
scheme [30] for the extrapolation of structural properties.
Our guiding wave functions [29], which enter the DMC
calculation, have the analytical form given in Eq. (5) of
Ref. [31], and recover between 84 and 96% of the DMC
energy when used in a variational quantum Monte Carlo
calculation. The DMC technique as implemented here
determines only the ground state of the system; accessing
excited state properties is in general not possible without
algorithmic modiﬁcations.

For comparison, we ﬁnd a DMC binding energy of
−2.9(5)×10−3cm−1 for the T↑ trimer, in agreement with
our hyperspherical calculation. The number in brackets
denotes the statistical uncertainty. Figure 3 compares the
ground state energy per particle E0/N of (T↑)N clusters
(pluses) with those of 4HeN clusters (using the LM2M2
potential [14], diamonds). This shows that (T↑)N clus-
ters are even more weakly bound than 4HeN clusters with
the same number of atoms.

The comparison between (T↑)N and 4HeN clusters can
be extended by considering their structural properties.
For example, we ﬁnd that the (T↑)5 cluster has an av-
erage interparticle distance of hrij i of 22.2a.u.; the 4He5
cluster, on the other hand, is hrij i = 13.6a.u. Even if one
takes into account that the classical equilibrium distance
larger
of the tritium triplet potential is about 2.2a.u.
than that of the He dimer potential, the diﬀerence be-
tween the expectation values of the interparticle distance
for these N = 5 clusters indicates that the spin-polarized
tritium system is even more diﬀuse than the 4He5 clus-
ter. To illustrate this aspect further, the inset of Fig. 3
compares the pair distribution of the (T↑)5 cluster (solid
line) with that of the 4He5 cluster (dotted line). Clearly,
the pair distribution of the (T↑)5 cluster is much broader
than that of the 4He5 cluster. We ﬁnd similar behavior
for clusters with more particles.

The tritium trimer is the smallest spin-polarized clus-
ter (the dimer is unbound). As discussed above, the
two-body potential for spin-polarized hydrogen is almost
identical to that of tritium. The hydrogen atom, how-
ever, is about a factor of three lighter. Consequently,
there is no bound state for the H↑ trimer. An interest-
ing question to ask is the following: how many atoms
are needed to form a bound system of spin-polarized
hydrogen atoms? Initial exploratory studies show that
more than 100 atoms are needed to form a bound spin-
polarized hydrogen cluster. The smallest spin-polarized
hydrogen cluster could then be thought of as a “super-
Borromean” cluster for which all smaller subsystems are
unbound. A detailed study will be published elsewhere.
In summary, this Letter proposes a number of intrigu-
ing possibilities for the physics of tritium systems. We
point out the possibility for forming a tritium condensate
with controllable parameters via a Feshbach resonance.
Down the road, one can imagine trapping an atomic hy-
drogen gas together with an atomic tritium gas, or pos-
sibly including deuterium to study fermion systems. We
further found that the spin-polarized trimer possesses a
Borromean, or halo, state. In addition, we mapped out
the properties of larger “exotic” spin-polarized tritium
clusters. Studies of spin-polarized clusters are interest-
ing by themselves [32], as they enter new many-body
physics regimes. For instance, unexpected physics may
emerge from manipulating the two-body interaction via
the Feshbach resonance in a cluster. In short, tritium of-
fers a wealth of interesting physics by virtue of its weak
attraction.

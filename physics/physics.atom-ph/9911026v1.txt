The stability and structure of systems comprising a nega-
tive ion and positrons are investigated by the stochastic vari-
ational method. It is shown that the H− and the Li− ions
can bind not only one but two positrons. The binding en-
,e+,e+)=0.57eV
ergies of these double positronic atoms E(H
and E(Li−,e+,e+)=0.15eV are somewhat smaller than those
of their single positronic counterparts (E(HPs)=1.06eV and
E(LiPs)=0.32 eV). We have also found that a Ps
and
a proton form a bound system.

The many-body problem is conceptually simple and
well deﬁned in atomic physics: indistinguishable fermions
(electrons) interact via the Coulomb potential in the ex-
ternal Coulomb ﬁeld of the atomic nuclei. The solution
of this many-body problem is very diﬃcult, because in
addition to the direct interaction between the electrons,
their indistinguishability brings an exchange correlation
into eﬀect. Despite the complexity enormous progress
has been made in this ﬁeld which has been rapidly de-
veloping ever since the birth of quantum mechanics. The
calculations have been mainly focused on systems (atoms
and molecules) where fast electronic motion takes place
in the ﬁeld of slowly moving heavy positive charges.

Much less is known about systems which contain posi-
tively and negatively charged particles of equal or nearly
equal masses. The simplest examples of these systems are
the Positronium ion (e+, e−, e−) (predicted by Wheeler
[1] in 1946, experimentally observed by Mills [2] in 1981),
the Ps2 molecule (e+, e+, e−, e−) (predicted by Hylleraas
and Ore [3] in 1947, not observed yet in nature), or the
HPs molecule (indirectly observed, see [4]). These sys-
tems have been extensively studied by various theoreti-
cal methods in the last few years [5]. The existence of
these small systems makes theorists curious as to whether
(similarly to molecules) larger stable systems containing
positrons can also be formed. One can ask whether a sys-
tem of m electrons n positrons (for example an (3e−, 3e+)
system) is bound or whether a positron, a positronium,
a Ps− ion or a Ps2 molecule can attach itself to an atom
or molecule.

The theoretical description of such systems (let alone
the prediction of their stability against autodissociation)
is obviously very diﬃcult. The diﬃculty can largely be
attributed to the fact that the electron-electron and the
electron-positron correlations are quite diﬀerent due to
the attraction and to absence of the Pauli-principle con-
straint in the latter case. The tiny binding energies of
these loosely bound extended systems require highly ac-

curate calculations.

Recent calculations have given the very surprising re-
sult that a positron can cling to a neutral atom [6]. The
simplest such positronic atom is the Lie+. The com-
plexity of the calculation of its small binding energy is
best illustrated by the fact that many otherwise suc-
cessful methods had failed to predict the existence of
the bound state of this system [7,8]. These calculations
show that the energy of the Lie+ is lower than that of
the Li atom but the energy was not below the Li++Ps
dissociation threshold. The ﬁrst rigorous proof show-
ing that the positron can attach itself to a Li atom was
given by Ryzhikh and Mitroy [6] by using the stochas-
tic variational method (SVM) [9,10]. This ﬁnding has
been later conﬁrmed by diﬀerent theoretical approaches
[11–13]. Other atoms (e.g. Be,Na,Mg,Cu,Zn and Ag)
has also been found to be capable of binding a positron
[14–16].

There is an other family of positronic atoms which are
formed when positronium is attached to an atom. The
possibility of the existence of such systems is more ob-
vious: removing the positron leaves behind a negatively
charged ion so one can understand how the positron be-
comes bound. The simplest example of such system is
the HPs molecule which has been the subject of numer-
ous theoretical investigations and has been experimen-
tally observed as well [4]. Another examples are the
LiPs, NaPs and KPs atoms. The LiPs has been de-
scribed by several microscopic methods [12,14], while the
other two bound systems have been predicted by a semi-
microscopic model [15,16].

In this paper we explore the possibility of the formation
of stable atoms/ions containing two or more positrons.
The simplest known example for such system is the Ps2
molecule. The study is inspired by the speculation that
if a neutral atom can bind a positron then it may even
be able to bind a positively charged Ps+=(e+,e+,e−) ion.
This motivation can also be phrased in an other way: If
positronium can bind itself to a neutral atom “A” form-
ing a neutral system “APs” then can we attach a positron
into APs?

The stochastic variational method systematically im-
proves the correlation functions between the particles
and it is especially suitable to solve Coulombic few-body
problems. The method has been tested on a number of
problems in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics and it has been
proved to be highly accurate and reliable [10,17]. The
present study is restricted to states with total orbital an-
gular momentum L=0 and the following trial function is
assumed

Ψ = A{e

− 1
2

xAx

χSMS },

(1)

where x = (x1, ...xN −1) is a set of relative coordinates,
χSMS is the spin function, and A is a matrix of nonlinear
variational parameters. The nonlinear parameters are
optimized by the stochastic variational method through
a trial and error procedure. The details can be found in
Ref. [10].

This trial function includes explicit exp(−αr2

ij ) corre-
lation factors between the particles and it gives very ac-
curate solutions provided that the nonlinear parameters
(in the exponents) are properly optimized. As the num-
ber of parameters for a typical system is at least a few
thousands a direct search for the optimal values is out
of question. The stochastic variational method sets up a
basis successively enlarging the model space by including
the optimal trial functions. This basis was systemati-
cally improved by a reﬁning procedure: The basis states
were replaced by randomly chosen states which lower the
energy. The energy found in this variational procedure
converges to the upper bound of the exact ground state
energy of the system. The Correlated Gaussians oﬀer
computational advantage:
fast analytical evaluation of
the matrix elements and good approximation to various
wave functions. They also have well-kown drawbacks
such as their slow convergence (compared to exponen-
tial functions) and the fact that they do not satisfy the
cusp condition.

The simplest (A,Ps+) is the (H,Ps+)=(p,e−,e−,e+,e+)
This ﬁve-body system can dissociate into
system.
H+Ps+, p+Ps2 or HPs+e+, the lowest dissociation
thresholds are shown in Fig. 1. To validate the method
we have calculated the energies of the Ps2 and HPs
molecules (see Table I.). The SVM signiﬁcantly improved
the theoretical values of the binding energies of these
systems. Our calculation shows that the energy of the
(H,Ps+) is below the dissociation threshold and forms
an electronically stable system. The H− ion can bind
not only one but two positrons. The binding energy of
(H,Ps+)=HPse+ (0.021 a.u) is comparable to that of HPs
(0.039 a.u.). The convergence of the energy as a function
of the basis dimension is shown in Table I.

The HPse+ system can be also viewed as a bound sys-
tem of a proton and a Ps2 molecule. The Ps2 molecule
cannot bind an extra electron or positron because of the
Pauli principle. Our calculations show that the Ps2 can
bind a charged particle if it is distinguishable from the
electron and the positron. The binding energy of a ﬁve-
body system Ps2+x+=(e+,e+,e−,e−,x+) consisting a hy-
potetical “x” particle is bound for any 0 ≤ me/mx ≤ 1
mass ratio. This has been checked by calculating the
binding energy of that system for several diﬀerent mx
masses (mx = 1050, 100, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1 in units of me). So
while the (e+,e+,e+,e−,e−) is unbound the Ps2 can bind
any charged particle, e.g. µ+ or p+, because the Pauli
principle does not restrict the motion of ﬁfth particle in
that case.

Some of the properties of these systems are shown in
Table II. It is intriguing to compare the relative dis-
tances between the particles in HPs and HPse+. The

electron-nucleus or electron-electron relative distances
are almost the same in the two systems. The average
nucleus-positron distance, however is substantially larger
in HPse+. An other interesting property is that the rel-
ative distance between positrons is about twice that be-
tween electrons. All these facts suggest that a possible
geometrical picture of the HPse+ looks as an isosceles tri-
angle formed by the two positrons and the proton and the
two electrons are moving between the positive charges.
The two positrons are placed on the vertices of the base-
line of the triangle, and this baseline is so long that the
system almost looks like as a linear chain. The HPse+
is somewhat related to H+
3 three protons and
3 .
two electrons form a very stable system, where the three
protons are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. By
changing the mass of two of the positive charges this equi-
lateral triangle is changed to an isosceles triangle, and in
the positronic limit it looks like a linear chain.

In H+

The Li atom can bind a positron or a positronium
forming an electronically stable Lie+ or LiPs [6]. The
binding energy of the Lie+ is very small and it can be
best viewed as a positronium orbiting around a Li+ core.
In our calculation we replace the positron with a Ps2

case we have six active particles, four electrons and two
positrons. This system has various diﬀerent dissociation
channels (see Fig. 2). The calculated energies of the
relevant subsystems are listed in Table III.

Our calculation shows that the Li can bind a Ps+ ion
to form an electronically stable LiPse+. The calculated
binding energy might not be very accurate due to the
complexity of the system, but it is deﬁnitely below the
lowest threshold (see Fig. 2). The convergence of the
binding energy is shown in Table I. Further increase of
the basis size would improve the ground state energy.

This system, again, can be viewed in diﬀerent ways.
One can say that a Li atom can bind a Ps+ ion, or a Li−
ion is able to bind two positrons or the Ps2 molecule can
attach itself to a Li+ ion.

The relative distances between the particles in LiPse+
are shown in Table III. The average distance between
the nucleus and the positron or between a positron and
an electron is larger than that in LiPs but smaller than
what one can ﬁnd in Lie+. This would suggest a picture
of LiPse+ as a Li+ core with an orbiting Ps2 molecule.

position in a spin singlet state (see eq.
The expectation values of the positron-electron delta
functions (δe+e− = hΨ|δ(re− − re+ )|Ψi) are 1.4 × 10−2,
1.1×10−2 and 1.1×10−2, for Lie+, LiPs and LiPse+. Due
to the possible inaccuracy of the energy and wave func-
tion of the LiPse+ system the annihilation rate should
be considered as a qualitative estimate and it is about
Γ2γ = 4.4 × 109 sec−1.

The (H−,e+,e+) is a positively charged system so one

may try to add one more electron to see if it remains
stable. The convergence of the energy is shown in Fig. 3.
The energy of the system slowly converges to the lowest
(HPs+Ps) threshold and the size of the system contin-
uously increases showing that this system is unlikely to
be bound. Surprisingly, however, by adding two elec-
trons to (H−,e+,e+) one gets a bound system as shown
in Fig. 3. This system “H−Ps2” contains a proton, two
positrons and four electrons, and can also be considered
as a three-body system of a proton a Ps− and a Ps− ion
as an analogy of the H− ion (where the electrons are re-
placed by the composite Ps− ions). The convergence of
the energy is slow and the calculation of a more accurate
binding energy would require a considerably larger basis
dimension (see Table I.)

We have shown, for the ﬁrst time, that neutral atoms
can bind not only a single positron but a more complex
positive charge, the Ps+ ion as well. Besides the two
cases (HPse+ and LiPse+) it is quite possible that other
systems can be also bound. Although the investigation of
larger systems is beyond the scope of the present method,
other approaches (like QMC [12,18] or Fixed core SVM
[15]) might be used to study the possible bound state of
Ps+ (or two positrons) with larger atoms/ions. Examples
are (1) the recent QMC study of positronic water [18] and
a new study with the Fixed core SVM which conﬁrms the
existence of the LiPse+ and shows that a larger ion (Na+)
[20] can also bind a Ps2 molecule.

The investigation of these exotic systems are very im-
portant from theoretical point of view. These systems
serve as test grounds for new methods: They provide a
special environment where not only the electron-electron
but other interleptonic correlations are also important.

While the chance of experimental observation of these
systems is even more challenging than those of the
positronic atoms [19], some of the properties of positronic
systems can be aﬀected by these bound states and the
theoretical prediction of their existence might be very
useful.

Systems, similar to (p+,e+,e+,e−,e−) might exist in
semiconductors. Both the charged exciton (system of
two electrons and a hole, akin to Ps−) and the biexciton
(two electrons and two holes, similar to Ps2) have been
experimentally observed [21,22]. Larger systems of “mul-
tiexcitons” (system of several electron-hole pairs) have
also been observed [23,24]. These systems are of course
diﬀerent from the electron-positron systems because the
electron-hole mass ratio (σ = me/mh) diﬀers from unity
and also because there is no annihilation so their obser-
vation might be easier. The stability for electrons and
positrons indicates the stability for systems with slightly
diﬀerent mass ratios. The present study might give a
hint for the existence of similar systems in semiconduc-
tors as well. In GaAs, for example, there are heavy holes
(σ = 0.196) and light holes (σ = 0.707). A system simi-
lar to (p+,e+,e+,e−,e−) would comprise two electrons, a
heavy, and two light holes.

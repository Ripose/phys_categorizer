We study the suppression of reﬂections in the numerical simulation of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for strong-ﬁeld problems on a grid using exterior complex scaling (ECS) as
absorbing boundary condition. It is shown that the ECS method can be applied in both the length
and the velocity gauge as long as appropriate restrictions are applied in the ECS transformation of
the electron-ﬁeld coupling. It is found that the ECS method improves the suppression of reﬂection
as compared to the conventional masking technique in typical simulations of atoms exposed to an
intense laser pulse. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of the ECS technique to avoid unphysical
artifacts in the evaluation of high harmonic spectra.

INTRODUCTION

With the progress in laser technology in recent years
[1, 2], the focused laser ﬁeld strengths increased rapidly
to exceed the strength of the Coulomb ﬁelds that bind
the electrons in the ground state of an atom or molecule.
Such intense light ﬁelds have led to the discovery of
novel aspects of light-matter interactions, such as multi-
photon ionization, above-threshold ionization, high har-
monic generation, multiple ionization to high charge
states, Coulomb explosion etc. The lowest-order per-
turbation theory of light-matter interaction is known to
1012
break down at light intensities above about I
W/cm2 for near optical wavelengths [3]. Several non-
perturbative theories of laser-matter interaction, such as
the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (TDSE) [4, 5, 6, 7], ab-initio methods based
on the Floquet theorem [8, 9, 10], basic set expansion
methods [11, 12, 13] or S-matrix and related theories
[14, 15, 16, 17], have been developed. Among these the
solution of the TDSE on a time-space grid is consid-
ered as a rigorous and powerful approach. For the in-
vestigation of most of the above-mentioned intense-ﬁeld
phenomena the simulation of an atom with N electrons,
which would require the solution of a set of 3
N di-
mensional partial diﬀerential equations, can be well ap-
proximated using the single-active-electron (SAE) model
[4]. In the latter only one of the electrons of the atom
is considered to become active and to interact with the
external ﬁeld, which reduces the numerical problem to
at most three dimensions. Any symmetry of the external
ﬁeld may further reduce the dimensionality.

×

Accurate solutions of time-dependent problems on the
grid require not only relatively dense grid points but,
in general, also a huge spatial extension of the grid to
account for the release and the motion of the electron
sub-wave packets in the ﬁeld. These factors result in
large memory and CPU requirements for the numerical
solution at high ﬁeld intensities. Fortunately, the im-
portant dynamics of several intense-ﬁeld processes occur
on a spatial volume close to the atom or molecule. A

few examples are the determination of ionization rates
[4] and high harmonic spectra [5] or the identiﬁcation of
dominant pathways to single [18] or nonsequential dou-
ble ionization [19] of a molecule. These studies can be
therefore performed on a relatively small grid neglecting
the exact form of the outgoing ionizing parts of the wave
function. It however requires to suppress reﬂections from
the edges of the numerical grid, which can cause artiﬁ-
cial eﬀects, e.g. in the form of spurious harmonics in high
harmonic spectra [5].

In calculations based on the numerical propagation of
wave packets in diﬀerent areas of physics and chemistry
several techniques have been proposed to compensate
for reﬂections, including masking functions (or equiva-
lently absorbing imaginary potentials) [5, 20, 21], repeti-
tive projection and Siegert state expansion methods [22],
complex coordinate rotation or exterior complex scal-
ing [23, 24] and others.
In the numerical solution of
the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation of atoms in
intense laser ﬁelds masking functions or absorbing po-
tentials are the most commonly used techniques (e.g.
[5, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]). The ECS technique is rarely
used in this context up to now [32, 33, 34], which might
be due to the fact, that its application in the electric ﬁeld
(or length) gauge has been thought to be not fruitful [33].
In this paper we re-examine the implementation of the
exterior complex scaling (ECS) method [30, 31] as ab-
sorbing boundary condition in simulations of strong-ﬁeld
problems. In particular, we focus on the application of
the ECS technique in diﬀerent gauges, namely the length
and the velocity gauge. On the basis of results of simula-
tions of 1D model atom exposed to an oscillating external
ﬁeld, we investigate appropriate restrictions of the ECS
transformation of the external-ﬁeld coupling to avoid un-
desired eﬀects in the absorbing area. Results for the
probability density and momentum distributions for the
interaction of the hydrogen atom with an intense laser
ﬁeld are then compared with those obtained using the
standard masking function technique. Finally, we con-
sider a typical strong-ﬁeld problem by using the ECS
method to calculate high harmonic spectra.

and the velocity gauges in simulations of atoms exposed
to intense laser pulses.

A.

Implementation

First, we illustrate the implementation of the ECS
technique in 1D and 2D time-dependent calculations, it
is straightforward to extend it to higher dimensions (c.f.
[24, 33]. Let us consider the non-relativistic electron dy-
namics in a time-independent (Coulomb) potential V0
and an external ﬁeld governed by the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation in cylinder coordinates as (Hartree
atomic units, me = ¯h = e = 1, are used throughout):

It is the aim of the ECS method to transform the out-
going wave into a function, which falls oﬀ exponentially
outside the interior box, while the wave-function keeps
unchanged in the region where the coordinates are real
[24, 36, 37]. In case of the present problem of an atom
exposed to an oscillating linearly polarized electromag-
netic pulse, we therefore investigate whether or not the
transformed solution of Eq. 1 shows this desired behav-
ior. To this end and without loss of generality, we restrict
our analysis to the Z direction, i.e. the direction of the
external ﬁeld. The time-dependent solution of the 1D
analogous of Eq. 1 in the complex area can be written
as:

ψ(t + ∆t)

i(H0(Z) + V (t))∆t]ψ(t).

or both coordinates are complex.

II. EXTERIOR COMPLEX SCALING (ECS) AS
ABSORBING BOUNDARY

The complex scaling method has been widely used in
physics and chemistry (for a review, see [39]), e.g.
in
the theory of potential scattering [40], calculation of res-
onances in atoms and molecules [41] or the calculation
of cross sections in scattering processes [42]. According
to this method the radial coordinate of the particles are
scaled by a complex phase factor, which distorts the spec-
trum of the Hamiltonian such that the continuous spec-
trum is rotated in the complex energy plane and the dis-
crete resonance eigenvalues are revealed. For our aim to
introduce absorbing boundaries at the edges of a numeri-
cal grid in time-dependent simulations we make use of an
extension of the complex scaling method, namely the ex-
terior complex scaling (ECS) technique [31], in which the
spatial coordinates are only scaled outside some distance
from the origin.

As discussed at the outset the ECS technique has been
used before [32, 33, 34] in time-dependent studies of
electron impact ionization as well as of the motion of
a charged particle in dc and ac electromagnetic ﬁelds.
In the latter context it has been mentioned [33] that it
appears to be not fruitful to apply ECS in the electric
ﬁeld (or length) gauge. We now revisit this question and
analyze below how ECS can be used in both the length

As discussed by McCurdy et al. [33] the exponent in the
second factor on the right hand side of Eq. (7) is always
negative if 0 < η < π/2 and provides already the desired
decay term. It is therefore important to note that the
wave-function will be basically absorbed in the complex
area due to the transformed kinetic operator term as long
as there are no counteracting eﬀects from other terms in
the Hamiltonian. In general, it is therefore required that
Im(V0)
(7) acts
0 such that the last term in Eq.
as an absorbing potential. In practice, the discontinuity
in the real and imaginary part of the potential terms
introduced by the complex scaling factor can generate
some small reﬂections. An eﬃcient way to avoid this
numerical problem appears to keep the Z-coordinate in
the potential term untransformed as a real number in the
absorption area. Please note that it is unproblematic to
abandon the additional absorption eﬀect of the imaginary
potential, since the decay of the wavefunction is already
ensured via the kinetic operator term.

the velocity gauge (upper row) and in the length gauge (lower

in the velocity gauge. In the right sides of Eqs. (8) and
(9), the second factors are oscillatory ones, and are sim-
ple scaled versions of the external-ﬁeld coupling as the
wavefunction enters the complex area. The ﬁrst factors,
however, can act both as an absorber or as an undesired
source, depending on the sign of the exponent. It is de-
termined in the length gauge by the instantaneous sign of
the oscillating electric ﬁeld, while in the velocity gauge,
it equals the sign of the product A(t)ˆpz. Next, we will
analyze the eﬀects of the oscillating ﬁeld coupling term
in numerical simulations and show that an undesired ex-
plosion of the wavefunction can be avoided by using the
standard untransformed coupling even in the absorption
region.

The respective vector potentials are derived from the
electric ﬁeld expressions in Eqs. (11) and (12). Please
note that the former ﬁeld, which is smoothly turned on
over 5 optical cycles, is similar to the ﬁeld form used by
McCurdy et al. [33]. The real part of the calculation box
is restricted in both cases by z1 =
25 a.u., with
the complex part extending over 12.5 a.u. on both sides
of the grid.

In Fig. 2 we present the temporal evolution of the

hand column). The panels in the upper and the lower
row show the numerical results obtained in the length

4

wavefunction is absorbed at the edges of the grid and no
signature of explosion is seen anymore.

We may therefore conclude that the exterior complex
scaling technique can be applied as an absorbing bound-
ary to time-dependent simulations on laser-atom simu-
lations in the length as well as in the velocity gauge as
long as the complex factors in Eqs. (8) and (9) are re-
moved. We may note that McCurdy et al. [33] reached
to a similar conclusion for the velocity gauge as they did
not transform the momentum ˆpZ to the complex plane.
Our analysis above shows that an analogous restriction
is possible in the length gauge as well. Our test calcula-
tions have shown that, in general, after omission of the
unstable factors calculations in the length gauge show
slightly better results than those in the velocity gauge.
We therefore restrict ourselves below to the length gauge
only.

Thus, the above implementation of the ECS technique
coincides with the desired absorbing boundary condition
in time-dependent strong-ﬁeld calculations. It has been
shown in the application of ECS to the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation (e.g.
[35, 38] and for review [24])
that using a sharp exterior scaling the derivative discon-
tinuity at the boundary is handled exactly, as long as
the boundary is chosen to coincide with a grid point. We
have adapted this strategy in the time-dependent calcula-
tions. In test calculations we have found that the absorp-
tion eﬀect at the boundaries is almost independent of the
scaling angle η, in the present calculations we have used
η = π/3. Finally, before proceeding with a comparison
of the ECS results with those obtained using the stan-
dard masking function technique we may note that spe-
cial care has to be taken in the representation of the ﬁrst
and second derivatives in the transformed Schr¨odinger
equation (for a detailed discussion, see [24]), which we
have approximated using Lagrange interpolating polyno-
mials [43].

C. Comparison of ECS and masking function
techniques as absorber

In order to analyze the eﬃciency of the ECS method as
absorber in time-dependent simulations as compared to
the masking function technique we present in this section
results of calculations for the interaction of the hydrogen
atom with a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld. We compare
the results obtained using the ECS method with those ob-
tained using conventional masking functions of the form:

M = cos

d

(cid:18)

(13)

where d is the length of the absorbing region, over which
M changes smoothly from 1 to 0, and xi is the boundary
point. Such a function has been applied at all boundaries
of the numerical grid (c.f. gray zones in Fig. 1).
In
the course of the calculations we have tested diﬀerent

FIG. 3: (color online) Same as Fig. 2 but using the untrans-
formed standard ﬁeld coupling on the entire grid.

and the velocity gauge, respectively. The eﬀect of the
ﬁrst factor in Eqs. (8) and (9) is most clearly seen in
the results of the low-frequency calculations, where we
observe an explosion of the wave-funtion in the second
part of the evolution after a signiﬁcant part of the wave-
function has entered the complex area. This is obviously
due to the fact that the term acts as a source over a half
cycle of the pulse. As expected above the same unphysi-
cal feature is found in the length as well as in the velocity
gauge. In the high-frequency case (left-hand column) the
results obtained in the two gauges are again similar, but
we do not observe a signiﬁcant amount of explosion. This
diﬀerence as compared to the Ti:sapphire calculations is
probably due to two factors: First, in the high-frequency
simulation the probability density, which enters the com-
plex area, is smaller than in the low-frequency calcula-
tions. Second, the rapid change of the sign of the electric
ﬁeld or the vector potential may eﬀectively prevent an
explosion, since the complex factor quickly changes be-
tween decay and source nature.

From the results presented above we may therefore in-
fer that the ECS transformation may lead to unphysical
results in both gauges due to the oscillating nature of the
external ﬁeld. The most straightforward strategy to cir-
cumvent this problem appears to simply neglect the ECS
transformation of the coordinates in the ﬁeld coupling
term. This means in other words that the untransformed
standard ﬁeld coupling (c.f. Eq. (3)) is used over the en-
tire grid including the absorbing area. Using this strategy
there is no risk to create a source term while the desired
decay of the wavefunction should be still achieved via the
kinetic operator term.

In order to test our expectations we have repeated the
simulations by dropping the term exp(iη) in Eq. (8) and
iη) in Eq. (9), the results are shown in Fig. 3. The
exp(
comparison with the respective panels of Fig. 3 show im-
mediately that the desired eﬀect is achieved. In partic-
ular in the low-frequency case (right hand column) the

III. CALCULATION OF HIGH HARMONIC
SPECTRA

Finally, we apply the ECS absorber to a typical
intense-ﬁeld phenomenon, namely the evaluation of high
harmonic spectra. High harmonic generation (HHG)
is an important process for laser frequency conversion
and the generation of attosecond pulses (for reviews, see
e.g.
[45, 46]). According to the semiclassical three-step
rescattering picture [47, 48], and conﬁrmed by quantum-
mechanical calculations [49], HHG can be understood as
the ionization of an electron by tunneling through the
barrier of the combined Coulomb and laser ﬁelds, fol-
lowed by the acceleration of the electron in the ﬁeld,
which may cause, for linear polarization of the ﬁeld, a
return of the electron to and its recombination with the
parent ion under the emission of a harmonic photon. On
the basis of this picture it is reasonable to limit the grid
size of an ab-initio calculation of high harmonic spectra
via the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, since be-
yond a certain distance from the nucleus outgoing wave
packets are expected to have no eﬀect on the high har-
monic spectra.

We have performed simulations of the 2D TDSE for
the hydrogen atom in an intense linearly polarized laser
pulse, given by the pulse form in Eq. (12) with E0 = 0.1
a.u. and ω = 0.057 a.u., and evaluated high harmonic
spectra as the Fourier transform of the time-dependent
dipole moment. Note that the dipole moment has been
determined over the interior box (i.e. without the ab-
sorbing regions). In order to analyze the eﬀect of reﬂec-
tions from the edges of the grid along the polarization

tron density distributions from the numerical solution of the
2D TDSE of the hydrogen atom exposed to an intense laser

row). Results obtained using ECS (left hand panels) are com-
pared with those obtained using the masking function (right
hand panels) as absorber. Field parameters as in Eq. (12).

masking functions, the results presented below are found
to be rather insensitive on the form of masking functions.

drogen atom,

The electric ﬁeld proﬁle is given by Eq. (12). The ﬁeld
parameters are the same as before. The grid parameters
are ∆z = 0.1 a.u., ∆ρ = 0.2 a.u. and the time step ∆t =
0.1 a.u.. The initial ground states have been obtained
via imaginary time propagation [44]. The absorber is
applied at ρ0 = 22 and z1 =
10. The width of
the absorber is chosen to be 20% of the grid size.

To demonstrate that the reduction of reﬂections is
present in the solution of the TDSE, we present in Fig.
4 probability density distributions. From the compari-
son between the results for ECS (left column) and for
the masking function (right column) at t = 165 a.u. and
in the upper and lower row, respectively,
t = 330 a.u.
the diﬀerence in the eﬃciency of the two absorbers is
clearly visible. The distributions obtained with the mask-
ing function show interference patterns due to the reﬂec-
tions at the boundaries, which are not seen in the results
for the ECS absorber. Note that at t = 165 a.u. the
wave packet has reached (and is reﬂected from) the up-
per boundary in Z-direction only, while at the end of the
pulse reﬂections in all directions have appeared.

direction on the spectra, we compare in Fig. 5 the re-
sults of three simulations, namely the full calculation as
a reference (black solid line), performed on a suﬃciently
large simulation box to prevent reﬂections at the bound-
aries, and calculations using ECS (red dashed line) and
masking function (blue dotted line) as absorbers. The
calculations with absorbers have been restricted along
the polarization axis by choosing z1 =
80 a.u.,
which exceeds the maximum excursion of the classical
electron trajectories of 63.6 a.u.. The absorbing part of
the grid has been chosen to extend over an additional 20
a.u. at both ends. In the transversal direction the grid
was chosen large enough to avoid reﬂections from this
boundary.

The results in Fig. 5a) show the typical high har-
monic spectrum with a plateau and a cut-oﬀ at N =
(Ip + 3.17Up)/ω
51, where Ip = 0.5 is the ionization
potential of the hydrogen atom and Up = I0/4ω2 = 0.77
is the ponderomotive potential. From the comparison in
Fig. 5 it is seen that the harmonics in the plateau do
not diﬀer signiﬁcantly. There are small deviations in the
minima between the harmonics obtained from the simu-
lation with the masking function but the maxima appear
to be unchanged. The eﬀects of the reﬂections become
visible at and beyond the cut-oﬀ, this region is enlarged
in Fig. 5b). While the results from the ECS calculation
almost agree with those from the full calculation over a
decrease in the signal of two orders of magnitude, the re-
sults evaluated with the masking function start to diﬀer
near the cut-oﬀ and the deviations increase up to an order
of magnitude in the signal beyond the cut-oﬀ. This “ar-
tiﬁcial” increase of the HHG signal in the cut-oﬀ region
results from those parts of the wavefunction reﬂected at
the boundary, which return to the nucleus and give rise
to harmonics without physical meaning. Note that an ac-
curate calculation of the harmonics in the cut-oﬀ regime
is e.g. important for analysis of the generation of single
attosecond pulses (e.g. [50]).

The eﬀect of the reﬂections even increases for longer
pulses, in which several wave packets reach the bound-
aries. This is seen from the results, presented in Fig. 6,
where harmonic spectra obtained for laser ﬁelds with a
constant envelope, E = E0 sin(ωt) with E0 = 0.05 and
ω = 0.057, having 3 (upper row), 6 (middle row) and
12 (bottom row) cycles are shown. Results obtained us-
ing ECS and masking function as absorber techniques
are shown in the left and right hand panels, respectively.
The absorbers were placed at z1 =
35 a.u. (here
the maximum excursion length is 30.8 a.u.), with an ad-
ditional absorbing region of 6 a.u. The grid size in ξ-
direction was big enough not to inﬂuence the results.
While the results obtained for the 3-cycle ﬁeld show the
expected cut-oﬀ at the 19th harmonic, spurious harmon-
ics due to reﬂections appear beyond the cut-oﬀ and in-
crease in signal as the number of ﬁeld cycles increases.
The comparison shows that for the ECS results the con-
trast ratio between the false and the plateau harmonics is
about 10−3 in all cases, while for the masking functions

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have investigated the implementa-
tion of the exterior complex scaling technique as an ab-
sorber in the numerical solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for strong-ﬁeld problems on a grid.
Our analysis has shown that the ECS technique can be
applied in both the length and the velocity gauge as long
as the untransformed ﬁeld coupling is used on the entire
grid including the absorbing area. It is found that the
decay due to the ECS transformation in the kinetic op-
erator term is suﬃcient to eﬃciently reduce reﬂections
at the grid boundaries. A comparative study has shown
that in this implementation a signiﬁcantly better sup-
pression of reﬂections can be achieved as using the con-
ventional masking function method. By application of
the ECS method to the evaluation of high harmonic spec-
tra diﬀerences in the suppression of artifacts, e.g. in form
of spurious harmonics, is demonstrated. The simple test
cases considered here should capture the essence of the re-
ﬂection problem, exterior complex scaling in both length
and velocity gauge can be therefore considered as an eﬃ-
cient absorption technique for numerical time-dependent
solutions in higher dimensions and/or of more complex
processes too.

Abstract.
Recently obtained recurrence formulae for relativistic
hydrogenic radial matrix elements are cast in a simpler and perhaps
more useful form. This is achieved with the help of a new relation
between the ra and the βrb terms (β is a 4 × 4 Dirac matrix and a, b are
constants) in the atomic matrix elements.

PACS number(s): 31.30.Jv, 03.65.Pm, 03.20.+i

The relation of quantum calculations with experimental results is usually made at
the level of expectation values or matrix elements of appropriate operators (Moss 1972,
Wong and Yeh 1983a,b, De Lange and Raab 1991, Quiney et al 1997). In atomic or
molecular physics this means matrix elements of powers of a radial coordinate between
hydrogenic states. This happens both because the hydrogen atom is exactly soluble
—hence very useful in approximate calculation schemes— and because a power of r
can be either a well deﬁned function of interest, like in the London or the Lennard-
Jones potentials, or as a term in the multipolar expansion of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Given such importance, we have been working in obtaining recurrence relations

between matrix elements of radial functions between hydrogenic eigenstates but in
the relativistic realm (Mart´inez-y-Romero et al 2000, 20001). Our purpose here is
to report on a new relationship we have recently found between hydrogenic matrix
elements of powers of r and of powers of βr that can simplify the task of using the
recurrence relation previously reported.

By extending to Dirac’s relativistic quantum mechanics a hypervirial method
(N´u˜nez-Y´epez et al 1995) that is known to led to the nonrelativistic Blanchard
recurrence relation (Blanchard 1974), it has been possible to obtain the relativistic
recurrence formulae (Mart´inez-y-Romero et al 2000, 20001)

Here we deﬁned E± ≡ E2 ± E1, β = diag(1, −1) is a 2 × 2 Dirac matrix, the kets
|1i and |2i stand for radial eigenstates of the relativistic hydrogen atom, solutions
of the Dirac equation Hkψk(r) = Ekψk(r), k = 1, 2, where k is a label that will
serve to distinguish the states appearing in the recurrence relations, ψk(r) is a radial
bispinor, and ∆±
21 ≡ ǫ2(2j2 + 1) ± ǫ1(2j1 + 1). The quantum number ǫ equals +1
when l = j + 1/2 and equals −1 when l = j − 1/2 where j = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, . . . is the
total angular momentum quantum number, and l is the orbital angular momentum
quantum number. It is to be noted that the relativistic states are often labeled by the
quantum number κ —as done in (Drake 1996)— instead of by ǫ; the relation between
these two numbers is κ = −ǫ(j + 1/2). The possibly complex numbers λ are the
constant exponents of the radial coordinate r. In the previous equations as in all the
paper we use atomic units (¯h = me = e = 1).

Written in full, the radial Dirac Hamiltonian Hk and the energy eigenvalues can

be written as (Drake 1996, Mart´inez-y-Romero et al 2000, 20001)

where pr = −(i/r)(1 + r d

nonzero elements, Vk(r) is a radial potential behaving as the fourth component of a
4-vector. As it must be clear from (6), the function ψk(r) is

where αF = 1/c ≃ 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant.

The recurrence relations (1) and (2) could be more useful if the matrix elements
of rλ were uncoupled from the matrix elements of βrλ. It is the purpose of this Letter
to show how to achieve such uncoupling [see also the rather cursory discussion in
(Ilarraza-Lomel´i et al 2001)].

To evaluate the relation that is needed to uncouple the recurrence relations, let us

ﬁrst evaluate H2ξ + ξH1, that is

Equation (16) is a recurrence relation that can be found useful for various tasks

but for now we just want to uncouple relations (1) and (2).

We need ﬁrst to equate rλ taken from equation (2), to rλ taken from equation (16);
in the resulting equation there is yet a term involving rλ−2 which we eliminate using
again (16). This gives us the following relation between matrix elements involving βrλ
terms only,

η0hs2|βrλ|s1i = η1hs2|βrλ−1|s1i + η2hs2|βrλ−2|s1i + η3hs2|βrλ−3|s1i, (18)

the explicit form of the coeﬃcients is given after equation (19).

To derive the recurrence relation involving matrix elements of rλ terms only, we
get the term βrλ−2 that arises from equating the term βrλ−3 taken from (1) to the
same term taken from (16). From here we also obtain also the terms βrλ and βrλ−1
that are to be substituted into (2). Doing such substitutions we ﬁnally obtain the
sought after recurrence relation

ν0hs2|rλ|s1i =ν1hs2|rλ−1|s1i + ν2hs2|rλ−2|s1i + ν3hs2|rλ−3|s1i
+ ν4hs2|rλ−4|s1i + ν5hs2|rλ−5|s1i.

The coeﬃcients in equations (18) and (19) are given by

in the case of the relativistic Pasternack-Sternheimer (1962) rule —i.e. ∆−
21 = λ = 0—
a relation which must then remain as given in our previous contributions (Mart´inez-
y-Romero et al 2000, 2001). The new uncoupled relations should be anyhow useful in
relativistic atomic or molecular physics calculations.

two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions

Abstract. The non–resonant two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions is studied
in second–order perturbation theory, based on Dirac’s equation. To carry out the
summation over the complete Coulomb spectrum, a Green’s function approach has
been applied to the computation of the ionization cross sections. Exact second–order
relativistic cross sections are compared with data as obtained from a relativistic long–
wavelength approximation as well as from the scaling of nonrelativistic results. For
high–Z ions, the relativistic wave function contraction may lower the two–photon
ionization cross sections by a factor of two or more, while retardation eﬀects appear
less pronounced but still give rise to non-negligible contributions.

The multi–photon ionization of atoms has been widely studied during the last few
decades. While, however, most previous atomic experiments focused on the multi–
photon ionization of the valence–shell electrons of the alkaline metal and group I
elements (Jaouen et al 1984, Antoine et al 1996), theoretical investigations—instead—
often dealt with the excitation and ionization of low–Z, hydrogen– and helium–like ions,
owing to their simplicity (Karule et al 1985, Maquet et al 1998). With the recent
progress in the development and set–up of coherent light sources in the EUV and x–ray
domain, such as the various free–electron lasers, it now become much more likely that
two– and multi–photon processes can be observed also for the inner–shell electrons of
medium and heavy elements in the near future (Kornberg et al 2002). Since, generally,
a relativistic theory is needed to describe such elements, a primary interest in studying
multi–photon processes may concern ﬁrst the importance of relativistic eﬀects along the
hydrogen isoelectronic sequence. In the past, similar investigations have been carried
out only for the decay of the 2s1/2 metastable level (Santos et al 2001) as well as for the
two–photon excitation from the 1s ground states of hydrogen–like ions (Szymanowski
et al 1997). To the best of our knowledge, however, no attempt has been made so far
to explore two– and multi–photon processes for medium and high–Z ions by means of
a relativistic theory.

In this paper, we consider the two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions in
second–order perturbation theory, based on Dirac’s equation. To obtain the total
ionization cross sections, a Green’s function approach is applied in section 2 to perform
the summation over the complete hydrogen spectrum appropriately. Using such an
approach, cross sections for the two–photon ionization of the 1s ground state of
hydrogen–like ions are calculated for nuclear charges in the range Z = 1, . . . , 100 in
order to explore both, the relativistic contraction of the wave functions as well as those
eﬀects which arise from the higher multipoles in the decomposition of the radiation ﬁeld,
i. e. the so–called retardation eﬀects. Section 3, later, provides a comparison of the cross
sections from the relativistic theory (as obtained in two diﬀerent approximations) as
well as from the scaling of non-relativistic results. Finally, a few conclusions are given
in section 4.

2.1. Green’s function method

Apart from the usual integration over the spatial coordinates, the evaluation of the
transition amplitude in in Eq. (1) also requires a summation over the complete spectrum
of the (hydrogen) ion. Obviously, this summation includes the sum over all discrete
states as well as an integration over continuum. In particular the second part, i. e. the
integration over the continuum, is rather diﬃcult to carry out in practice since it implies
the computation of free–free electronic transitions. An alternative to carrying out the
summation over the spectrum explicitly in the transition amplitude is given by a change

Here and in the following, we use Hartree atomic units. Since the two–photon ionization cross section

along the photon momenta k. For a proper radial–angular representation of all Coulomb
wave and Green’s functions, then, the transition amplitude can be reduced to a (ﬁnite)
sum of products of the type angular coeﬃcient
radial integral , in dependence on the
number of multipoles and on further approximations which are made for the (coupling
of the) radiation ﬁeld.
In our computations, the angular coeﬃcients were obtained
algebraically, using the Racah program (Fritzsche 1997, Fritzsche et al 2001). For the
radial integrals, in contrast, we applied the procedures from the Greens library (Koval
and Fritzsche 2003). Owing to the structure of the radial Green’s function (matrix) this

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Relativistic Z-scaling rule

Diﬀerent approximations can be applied to investigate the two–photon ionization of
hydrogen–like ions, in dependence on the photon frequency and the nuclear charge. In
nonrelativistic quantum theory, for instance, the total non–resonant cross section in the
long–wavelength approximation is known to scale down like

i. e. with the sixth power of the nuclear charge, if—at the same time—the photon energy
is scaled with Z 2 (Zernik 1964). This scaling rule for the non–resonant part of the cross

deﬁnition of ε, however, the interpretation of the scaling rule (6) becomes quite simple
as, say, a value ε = 1.05 obviously speciﬁes the photon energy so, that the total energy
of the two photons together exceeds the 1s threshold by just 5%; a deﬁnition which can
be used also in the nonrelativistic case. Thus, the net deviation between the various
approximations is shown in the scaling factor ξ(Z) which, in the nonrelativistic limit, is

for ε = 1.05, i. e. for a two–photon excess energy of 5 % which is well within the non–
resonant region. Three diﬀerent approximations are shown in this ﬁgure: Apart from the
trivial nonrelativistic factor ξ(Z) = 1, the scaling factors are given for the relativistic
long–wavelength approximation eikr = 1 (dashed–dotted line) as well as for the exact
second–order perturbation treatment of all retardation eﬀects (solid line). In practice,
only the multipole ﬁelds up to Lmax = 5 are needed in (4) in order to obtain convergence
of the corresponding cross sections at about the 1% level.

When compared with the nonrelativistic decrease of the two–photon ionization cross
sections, owing to the 1/Z 6 scaling of the cross sections in Eq. (5), a further signiﬁcant
reduction arises for multiple and highly–charged ions mainly because of the relativistic
contraction of the wave functions towards the nucleus. This contraction can lower the

cross sections easily by a factor of two or more in the high–Z domain. The incorporation
of higher multipoles beyond the E1–E1 dipole approximation, in contrast, contributes
even for large values of Z
5% for photon energies near the two–photon
threshold. Somewhat larger retardation eﬀects, however, are found for higher photon
energies. For a two–photon excess energy of, say, 40 % above the threshold [cf. Figure
2], the retarded two–photon cross sections (solid line) are now larger than the cross
sections in the long–wavelength approximation with deviation up to about 30 % at the
high–Z end of the sequence. The behaviour of the retarded cross sections with respect to
the long–wavelength approximation clearly shows the importance of higher multipoles
which, otherwise, are usually seen only in angle–diﬀerential measurements (Surzhykov
et al 2002).

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, the non–resonant two–photon ionization of hydrogen–like ions has been
studied in detail within the relativistic theory. Emphasize was placed, in particular, on
the relativistic contraction of the wave functions as well as on the retardation in the
cross sections which arise from higher multipoles of the radiation ﬁeld. However, our
computations also showed that a Green’s function approach may provide a reliable access
to second–order properties other than the total two–photon ionization cross sections.
Investigations on the angle–diﬀerential emission of electrons as well as the two–photon
decay of few–electron ions are currently under work.

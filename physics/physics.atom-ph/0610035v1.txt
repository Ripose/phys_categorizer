We present the atomic parity violation measurements made in Cs vapour using a pump-probe
scheme. After pulsed excitation of the 6S-7S forbidden transition in the presence of a longitudinal
electric ﬁeld, a laser beam resonant with one of the 7S-6P transitions stimulates the 7S atom emission
for a duration of 20 ns. The polarisation of the ampliﬁed probe beam is analysed. A seven-fold
signature allows discrimination of the parity violating linear dichroism, and real-time calibration by
a similar, known, parity conserving linear dichroism. The zero-ﬁeld linear dichroism signal due to the
magnetic dipole transition moment is observed for the ﬁrst time, and used for in-situ determination

the 0.1% accuracy level.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we present the PV measurements we have
performed in Cs [1], by making use of a probe beam su-
perposed with the beam that drives the 6S-7S forbid-
den transition. After the probe beam has been ampliﬁed
by stimulated emission of the excited vapour, its polar-
isation is analysed so as to extract the PV asymmetry,
calibrated against a parity conserving signal. This ex-
perimental scheme has the potential for high precision
PV measurements, since the PV asymmetry to be mea-
sured is an increasing function of the excited atom num-
ber density. The quantity of metal necessary for vapour
cell operation is orders of magnitude smaller than in an
atomic beam experiment, and would be acceptable for an
experiment with the long lived isotope 135Cs.

II. MOTIVATIONS

Since the emergence of the ﬁeld [2], atomic parity vio-
lation (APV) measurements in heavy atoms have evolved
and diversiﬁed [3]. These diﬃcult experiments are moti-
vated by the fact that APV measurements provide unique
inputs for testing the Standard Model (SM). Measure-
ments at the pole of the Z0 boson mass energy have
reached an impressive precision, but testing, for instance,

the variation of the value of the weak mixing angle with
energy requires data taken at diﬀerent energy scales,
such as the recent measurement of the PV asymmetry in
Møller scattering [4], and the APV measurements in cae-
sium. The corresponding momentum transfers are about
160 MeV/c and a few MeV/c respectively, to be com-
pared with 100 GeV/c at the Z0 pole. Besides the energy
scale, the information extracted from a determination of
the Cs weak charge QW is a test in the hadronic sector
of the SM, and a test diﬀerent from those extracted, for
instance, from the inelastic scattering processes exploited
in [5]. In a model-independent analysis of the results, the
corresponding allowed regions, in the plane spanned by
the elementary weak charges of the u and d quarks, turn
out to be nearly orthogonal.
Relevance to physics beyond the SM is one more mo-
tivation. APV experiments are particularly sensitive,
among the P-violating processes, to those possibly medi-
ated by particles with a mass in the MeV range, while
such a ”light” boson could escape detection in high en-
ergy experiments [6]. The U boson predicted by some
supersymmetric extensions of the SM is a candidate to
explain, through dark matter recombination, the astro-
physical observation that the bulge of the galaxy shows a
signiﬁcant emission at 511 keV [7]. However, to account
for the moderate intensity of the emission line, one has to
assume [6] that the axial coupling of the U boson (mass
≈ 10 MeV) to electrons is very small. Indeed the present
agreement between APV measurements in Cs and the
SM [8] excludes such an axial coupling at the 10−6 level.
Some of the Kaluza-Klein models of space-time also make
predictions of eﬀects observable in APV without counter-
parts in high-energy experiments [9].
The Boulder measurement [10], with two 0.5% precision
measurements on two hyperﬁne (HF) components of the
Cs forbidden transition, is the only experiment that could

achieve a precision test of the standard model at very
low energy. Controlling the systematics [11] has been a
diﬃcult aspect of this experiment, and a cross-check of
this measurement would be highly valuable, in regard of
the implications of APV experiments. The experimental
scheme developed in Paris and presented in this paper
combines the advantages i) of the ”Stark” (electric ﬁeld
enhanced excitation) experiments: very well deﬁned sig-
nature, removing the need for scanning the excitation
wavelength to identify the PV signal, and hence the risk
associated with the ”wavelength-dependent analysis an-
gle” of the optical rotation experiments in heavier atoms;
and ii) of those latter ”transmission” experiments: use of
the probe beam allows to detect the whole excited vapour
column with high eﬃciency.
Most importantly, our experimental scheme has only two
features in common with those of the Boulder experi-
ment: the choice of the 6S1/2 −7S1/2 forbidden transition
and the application of a Stark ﬁeld, both suggested in
[2]. As a result the systematic eﬀects are very diﬀerent,
a crucial point since the measurements presented here
aim at a cross-check of the Boulder experiment. Some
of the many diﬀerences will be highlighted in the text.
The most original feature here is the increase of the de-
tected asymmetries with the applied electric ﬁeld. Our
proposal [12] to best take advantage of this feature, will
be presented brieﬂy, keeping in mind the goal of APV
measurements at the 0.1% level.

III. PRINCIPLES OF THE EXPERIMENT

A pulsed, 539 nm laser beam excites the 6S1/2, F =
3 → 7S1/2, F = 4 HF transition of Cs while a longitudi-
nal electric ﬁeld is applied, for a duration of only 100 ns
not to trigger discharges in the 8 cm long cell [13]. After
this powerful (1.5 mJ in 15 ns) excitation of the forbid-
den transition, a weak (1 mW), infrared beam stimulates
emission on the 7S1/2, F = 4 → 6P3/2, F = 4 allowed
transition, for 20 ns. The pump and probe beams are su-
perposed with the same direction ˆk and the same linear
polarisations ˆǫexc k ˆǫpr. The PV signal is the change of
the probe polarisation associated to the excitation of the
forbidden transition.
An eﬀective dipole operator [2] can be used to describe
the excitation of the forbidden transition:

′

1 ~σ − M

− ˆǫexc · ~def f = ˆǫexc ·(iImEpv

1~σ ∧ ˆk + iβ~σ ∧ ~E + α ~E).
(1)
The ﬁrst term is the PV electric dipole amplitude (~σ is
the spin Pauli operator, and iImEpv
is pure imaginary),
1
the second one is the magnetic dipole contribution, and
the two last ones are the Stark-induced, respectively vec-
tor and scalar, contributions. To give orders of magni-
tude, the corresponding partial 7S1/2 lifetimes are about
12 million years for the PV electric dipole amplitude, 12
days for the magnetic dipole amplitude, 300 s and 3 s,
respectively, for the vector and scalar Stark-induced tran-

sitions in a 2kV/cm ~E ﬁeld. However, in a longitudinal
ﬁeld ~El = El ˆz, the α ~E · ˆǫexc term is absent since the
excitation polarisation is transverse to ˆk k ˆz. Also im-
portant is the fact that, due to the choice of the linearly

with the iβ~σ ∧ ~El pure imaginary term. This is a crucial
diﬀerence with the Boulder experiment, where these two

by an angle θpv = −ImEpv
1 /βEl. As a result, the
eigen-axes of the excited state density matrix ρ7S ∝
(βElσx)2 ∝ (βElFx)2 will be tilted as well. Con-
sequently, the vapour will act on the probe as an
anisotropic ampliﬁer with eigen-axes tilted, by the angle
θpv, with respect to the symmetry planes imposed by the
direction of the linear polarisation ˆǫexc. The tilt angle
θpv is small, 10−6 radian at El ≈ 1.6 kV/cm, but is odd
in El reversal, a clear-cut signature. Hence the PV signal
will be a change of the linear polarisation of the ampliﬁed
probe beam, odd under El reversal, manifesting the pres-
ence, in the probe gain matrix, of a chiral contribution
associated with the pseudoscalar (ˆǫexc ·ˆǫpr)(ˆǫexc ∧ˆǫpr · ~El).
Although the expected probe polarisation signal can be
calculated [14], an eﬃcient calibration has been obtained
by deliberately tilting ˆǫexc by a known angle θcal and
measuring the corresponding probe polarisation signal in
rigorously identical conditions. For θcal in the millira-
dian range, proportionality is good enough [15] to allow
linear extraction of θpv from the PV signal. As compared
to the Boulder experiment, this calibration procedure is
obtained in real-time, and is free from any lineshape cor-
rection.

IV. SHORT REVIEW OF THE SYSTEMATIC
EFFECTS

Systematics can be classiﬁed as rank-1 or rank-2, ac-

cording to the number of defects involved.
Rank-1: i) A tilt of ˆǫexc, if it were odd in the reversal
of the applied electric ﬁeld, would give rise to a system-
atic eﬀect: this is looked for and estimated by real time
monitoring of ˆǫexc. ii) Remembering that a longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld induces Larmor rotation of the eigen-axes
of the vapour, an El-odd Bz ﬁeld would give rise to a
systematic. Although the symmetry of the experiment
forbids even an El-even Bz ﬁeld, a signiﬁcant fraction

z , using atomic signals (see sect. VI).

of the data acquisition is devoted to the measurement of
B−
Rank-2: i) An oﬀset between the pump and probe po-
larisations, in the presence of an imperfect reversal of the
applied ~El ﬁeld, could give rise to a systematic. However
the data processing (see sect. VI) is made in a way that
rejects their coupling. In addition, these two imperfec-
tions monitored using speciﬁc signals are kept below 10−4
and 10−3, respectively. ii) Defects that break cylindrical
symmetry.
Ideally, simultaneous rotation of the pump
and probe polarisations (and the corresponding polarime-
ters) should leave the experiment unchanged, except for
possible transverse electric or magnetic ﬁelds, or a mis-
alignment between the excitation and probe beam [16].
The coupling of a transverse electric ﬁeld to a transverse
magnetic ﬁeld gives rise, in the calibrated probe polari-
sation signal, to a contribution

in which ωF
′ τ is the average Larmor precession under the
magnetic ﬁeld ~Bt during the time spent by the atoms in
the excited state. This term mimics the PV El-odd term
if the ~Bt and ~Et ﬁelds are both odd, or both even, in ~El
reversal. When averaged over two polarisations at 90◦
of each other, this systematic is reduced by a factor of
1/2 (”class 1” systematic eﬀect). On the other hand,
the angular dependence, ˆBt · ( ˆEl ∧ ˆǫexc) · ( ˆBt · ˆǫexc), of
the systematic due to the second-order perturbation by
a magnetic ﬁeld completely cancels in the 90◦ switch po-
larisation average: ”class 2” systematic eﬀect.
In ref.
[16] can be found the inventory of both class 1 (the most
important ones) and class 2 systematic eﬀects.

V.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXPERIMENT

We brieﬂy recall the experimental setup, more exten-
sively described in [17], [1], where the absolute frequency
stabilisation of the laser sources is presented.
The excitation and probe beams are recombined using
a dichroic mirror (see Fig. 1). Beforehand, the polari-
sation of each of the two beams has been prepared in
a ”polariser unit” made of a calcite Glan polariser that
deﬁnes the vertical polarisation, and several half-wave
plates that are mechanically inserted to work with hori-
zontal, or +/- 45◦ polarisation. The excitation polariser
unit also includes i) a wave plate chosen to be precisely
1 × λexc at normal incidence. When appropriately tilted,
it allows to compensate the birefringence in the input
Cs cell window; ii) a Faraday modulator, providing the
±θcal tilts required for the calibration procedure. The
probe polariser unit includes a tilted glass plate to com-
pensate for the linear dichroism in the recombination
mirror. The ”analyser units” are based on a two-channel,
balanced-mode polarimeter [18], preceded by several half-
wave plates, two of which are inserted synchronously with

the half-wave plates of the corresponding polariser unit,
so as to operate the polarimeter always in the same con-
ditions. The third half-wave plate has its axes at 45◦
to the axes of the polarimeter. Inserting this ”cleaner”
half wave plate allows to reject the polarimeter signals
that are not due to a beam polarisation change [19]. The
probe analyser records two kinds of signal: the ﬁrst 20 ns
probe shot, immediately after excitation of the forbidden
transition, which contains the excited state contribution,
and, one ms later, a burst of four probe shots, which
serves as a reference for the probe polarisation signals.
Sapphire appeared as an appropriate material for the cell
body, due to its very low surface conductivity in the pres-
ence of caesium vapour [20]. This should have suppressed
the B−
z ﬁeld. However, a considerable electron charge
(and corresponding current) was observed at the anode
window of the sapphire cells, until we could mechanically
suppress the multiplication, due to secondary emission, of
the electrons emitted at the cathode window [21]. Then
the B−
z ﬁeld was observed to be at most a few tens of
µG, corresponding to a false eﬀect of a fraction of the
PV signal (11% on average), for which we can correct
practically in real time. Measurement of B−
z uses the
(large) optical rotation signal on the F=4 to F=5 probe
transition [22].

VI. MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE

The basic element of the data acquisition is the simul-
taneous recording of the two signals of the two-channel
probe polarimeter, to form the imbalance Dampl ≡ (S1 −
S2)/(S1 + S2) with the ampliﬁed probe beam. After
the reference probe pulses have been detected, the corre-
sponding imbalance is subtracted: Dat ≡ Dampl − Dref ,
and this is repeated for 30 shots (duration 200 ms) be-

fore θcal is reversed. The next reversal is that of the
electric ﬁeld (period 800 ms). Insertion and removal of
the ”cleaner” half-wave plate is repeated every 7 s. The
input probe polarisation undergoes a 90◦ switch every
14 s. A value θpv is then obtained by [θpv]ˆǫexc = θcal×

(cid:28)

< σcleanσcalDat({σj }) >σcleanσcal (cid:21)(cid:29)σE σ90◦ pr

(4)
where σi indicates the state of reversal (or plate inser-
tion) i. Beside this parity violating, linear dichroism,
other linear combinations are monitored for diagnosis of
possible drifts or systematics. The probe optical rota-
tion, obtained by inserting a factor σ90◦pr after the σE
factor in equation above, is used for measuring the B−
z
ﬁeld. In order to suppress systematics (see sect. IV), two
”isotropic values” of θpv are obtained, every 5 mn, after
ˆǫexc has been switched by 90◦, then ±45◦:

1
2

2

Sxy ≡

([θpv]x + [θpv]y) and Suv ≡

([θpv]u + [θpv]v).
(5)
The recording of isotropic values goes on for about 90 mn,
after which a last reversal is performed, concerning the
cell orientation with respect to the light beams. Oper-
ating at normal incidence at the cell windows gives rise
to an excess noise on the polarimetric measurement, due
to an etalon, interference eﬀect between the cell windows
and optical surfaces inside the polarimeter. To prevent
this, the cell is tilted by an angle ψ = 3 × 10−3 rad. How-
ever, the atoms excited by the 539 nm beam reﬂected at
the exit cell also contribute. This beam is tilted by an
angle 2ψ with respect to the probe beam, and it can be
shown that the rank-2 systematic associated with this
tilt coupled to a transverse electric ﬁeld is linear in ψ
[16],[1]. It is suppressed by i) reversing the angle ψ, and
ii) reducing the window reﬂection (see sect. VII).
Finally, a PV data-taking run starts and closes with the
measurement of the optical rotation on the 4→5 probe
transition to determine the value of the stray B−
z ﬁeld
and correct for the associated contribution. This length-
ens data acquisition by about 60%. On the other hand,
the measurement of the stray, transverse electric and
magnetic ﬁelds, made by application of large, controlled,
transverse magnetic ﬁelds, does not increase signiﬁcantly
data taking duration, although it is regularly repeated
throughout the data acquisition. In the results presented
below, the systematics are controlled and kept at the 1%
level. The 2.6% total error bar on the average is mainly
statistical, and includes the slight contribution due to the
B−

z systematic correction.

recorded is indicated. The ﬁrst measurement took place
in 2002 [23] and conﬁrmed the validity of the method.
Later, eﬀorts devoted to the reduction of the noise and
of the systematics have improved the statistics, as is obvi-
ous from the inset of Fig.2: the standard deviation of the
isotropic values recorded in cell #7 is 2.5 times smaller
that in cell #1.
This has resulted from implementing:
- sapphire cells with highly parallel windows [24]. The
fraction of the excitation beam reﬂected at each window
can be made very small (10−3 instead of 5% in cell #1)
by choosing a temperature such that the reﬂection is can-
celled by interference. This further suppresses the sys-
tematic eﬀect associated with the tilted reﬂected beam
(see sect. VI). It also suppresses the interference between
the beams reﬂected at the input and exit windows.
- a ”polarisation magniﬁer” [25]. This device, made of
4 or 6 plates at Brewster incidence, enhances the an-
gle of the polarisation tilt to be measured by the po-
larimeter. Since it attenuates the beam, it allows higher
probe power without changing the polarimeter pream-
pliﬁer chain, improving the signal/noise ratio when the
photon shot noise contribution is signiﬁcant.
- a better extinction for the probe optical switch. The
probe intensity that leaks through the closed optical
switch can contribute to the noise.
- long term absolute frequency stabilisation of the exci-
tation [1].
A statistical analysis [1] shows that the values obtained

identical: the material of the cell tube (alumina ceramics
vs monocrystalline sapphire), the polishing/origin/tilt of
the windows, the ﬁlling of the cells (unexpected foreign
gas observed in cell #3) etc. were diﬀerent. The agree-
ment brings conﬁdence in the absence of a bias from cell
imperfections. The fact that the averages of the Sxy and
Suv values agree to about 0.7% also brings conﬁdence as
to the cylindrical symmetry of the experiment.

MEASUREMENT OF THE ~El FIELD

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

′

First, the measurements presented above rely on the
determination of the Faraday rotation angle used for cal-
ibration of the PV linear dichroism signal. This was done
by diﬀerent methods, in particular by measuring the me-
chanical rotation of the polariser that compensates for
the Faraday rotation, with an accuracy of about 0.5%,
that could be improved if need be.
Second, the determination of θpv = −ImEpv
1 /βEl can be
exploited only if El is known with enough accuracy in-
side the vapour, i.e., measured by the atoms themselves.
This can be done by measuring the Stark parity con-
serving alignment, proportional to θcalβ2E2
l , and then

The proportionality factors are the same, except for the
inﬂuence of saturation by the probe beam: in the pres-
ence of the applied, ≈ 1.6kV/cm electric ﬁeld, the am-
pliﬁcation of the probe beam is non-negligible, while it is
very small, and buried in noise and background, in the
absence of electric ﬁeld. An accurate calibration of the
electric ﬁeld can be obtained by the comparison of these
two, similar, linear dichroism signals, both measured vs
probe beam intensity Ipr and extrapolated to Ipr = 0:

the value of 0.962±0.005 obtained from the Boulder mea-
surement [10] on the same 6S, F=3 → 7S, F=4 hyperﬁne
transition. Using the value of the β polarisability pub-

transition dipole, ImEpv
1 (3 → 4) = −0.808 × 10−11 |e|a0,
is obtained with a 2.1 × 10−13 |e|a0 absolute uncertainty.
Our experimental method is very diﬀerent from that used
by the Boulder group [11], with many consequences as
regards calibration, or systematics. It makes use of the
ampliﬁcation of a probe beam, the higher the gain, the
larger the asymmetry to be measured. Hence, the PV
asymmetry is an increasing function of the applied elec-
tric ﬁeld. One important consequence is the considerable
enhancement of sensitivity that can be foreseen in an
experiment with a transverse electric ﬁeld and a longer
interaction length [12]. Despite the transverse ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration, a special multi-electrode design can ”restore
cylindrical symmetry”, which helps in tracking and re-
jecting systematic eﬀects [27]. With reasonably moder-
ate values of the probe gain (still far from spontaneous
superradiance), a sensitivity of 0.1% looks a realistic ob-
jective, although the regime of higher gains (triggered
superradiance) probably deserves speciﬁc attention. The
suggested experiment involves the excitation in the pres-
ence of transverse magnetic and electric ﬁelds, with two
counter-propagating excitation beams. It is further mo-
tivated by the recent progress in the atomic physics cal-
culations of the factor that links the nuclear spin inde-
pendant value of Epv
to the Cs nucleus weak charge, now

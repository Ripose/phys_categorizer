Summary. — A classical model of the hydrogen atom in a static electric
ﬁeld is studied, basing upon the work [ Hooker A. et al, Phys. Rev. A, 55
(1997) 4609 ]. In that work the electrons are supposed to move along Kepler
orbits around the nucleus, while interacting with the external ﬁeld. That
classical model reproduces very well the true energy shift of the linear Stark
eﬀect. The agreement with the second order eﬀect is poor. It is shown here
that the results for the quadratic Stark eﬀect may be considerably improved
if the electrons are still allowed to move along classical trajectories, but whose
initial conditions are statistically sampled from a distribution resembling the
quantum mechanical one.

1. - Introduction

The use of classical models to study quantum mechanical systems is largely
employed in microscopic physics. For large quantum numbers it is justiﬁed on
the basis of the correspondence principle. Also at small quantum numbers its
utility is not negligible since it allows at least to obtain a qualitative insight
of the dynamics of the system; in the best cases, it is even possible to extract
quantitative results in a easy way and with a good accuracy. Some examples
are the scattering of electrons from an atom [1, 2], and the treatment of
energetic ion–atom collisions [3, 4, 5]. Classical model are obviously favoured
over their quantum–mechanical counterparts from the numerical point of
view. In those cases where also the quantum problem is solvable, the classical
picture is important since it allows to clearly visualize the problem at hand.
For these reasons the correspondence between the classical and quantum
mechanical descriptions is currently a well studied topic.

Quite recently it has been proposed a purely classical view to the Stark
eﬀect in hydrogen [6]: the ﬁeld is supposed to interact with classical electrons
following Kepler orbits around the nucleus. Following this work, in ref. [7] the
energy shifts for the linear and quadratic Stark eﬀect have been computed.
The agreement between the classical result and the exact quantum mechan-
ical one is excellent for the linear eﬀect but is not good for the quadratic
eﬀect, which only asymptotically for large quantum numbers approaches the
correct value.

The purpose of the present paper is to show that, within a purely classi-
cal formalism2 very similar to that of [7], the quadratic Stark eﬀect may be
reproduced very accurately: it is enough to relax the bounds on the electron
trajectory and adopt a statistical approach: here, the electron is still mod-
elled as a classical particle following Kepler orbits but the initial conditions
2 It must be stressed that any ”classical” model necessarily incorporates some elements
of the quantum theory in order to simulate a microscopic object. The relevance of the
approach [7] and of the present paper is that only initial conditions are to be chosen
compatible with the laws of quantum mechanics.

that a much better agreement is obtained by this slightly more sophisticated
approach.

Atomic units will be used throughout this work unless explicitly stated.

2. - The classical model of [7]

As well known, the study of the Stark eﬀect is easily performed in parabolic
coordinates, where the hydrogen atom is classiﬁed by the quantum num-
bers n, n1, n2, m. We are considering small ﬁelds, for which a perturbative
approach is adequate and they still are good quantum numbers.

I will ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the treatment of the ﬁrst–order Stark eﬀect,
which will be useful also to introduce the main concepts used later. First of
all, let us recall some results stated in [6]. In that work a correspondence
has been done between the quantum mechanical operators and their classical
counterparts:

•

to each set of values n1, n2, n, m there corresponds a set of classical Ke-
plerian orbits of the electron which are generally elliptical, with eccen-
l2/n2 (l is angular quantum number in spherical co-
tricity ε =
ordinates, and the classical angular momentum). When time–averaged
over a period of rotation, the ellipse yields a non zero mean electric
dipole moment:

The energy shift in presence of an electric ﬁeld F is calculated from

It is immediate to see that this result agrees with the energy shift

In [7] it was veriﬁed by numerically integrating the Kepler orbits in pres-
ence of an electric ﬁeld and with initial conditions compatible with the quan-
tized value (2) that the classical energy shifts from its unperturbed value of
the quantity (5).

The quadratic eﬀect is of relevance when n1 = n2, in which case the
linear term vanishes. This means–in the language of [6]–that the mean dipole
moment vanishes, and this happens when the orbits are circular and lying
on a plane perpendicular to the ﬁeld axis. The electric ﬁeld may induce a
dipole moment by shifting the electron and the nucleus with respect to each
other. The energy shift for the quadratic Stark eﬀect is deﬁned by

α being the polarizability. α is related to the induced dipole moment by

In [7] a simple approximation is used to compute the classical value of α,
αcl: be r the radius of the circular orbit of the electron, and δz the shift
along the direction of F between the electron and the nucleus induced by the
external ﬁeld. For small values of δz we may approximate the Coulomb force
on the electron as δz/r3, which balances the force exerted on the electron by
F when

The induced average dipole moment is d = δz and, from eq. (9) and the
deﬁnition of α (7),

F =

αcl = r3 = n6

since for circular Bohr orbits r = n2.

Even if this is a very simpliﬁed model, it was veriﬁed in [7] that it de-
scribes very accurately the classical system: the Hamilton’s equations for the
electron were numerically solved in presence of the electric ﬁeld. The electron
energy was determined from its position and momentum. The numerical re-
sults were found to agree well with eq. (10) (see ﬁg. 3 of [7]). It is therefore
correct to assume that αcl is well approximated by eq. (10).

Eqns. (8) and (10) only agree for n

for small ns: for example, when n = 1 the ratio is αcl/αQM = 2/9

In classical approximations the quantum dynamics of a system is com-
puted through an averaging over an ensemble of classical trajectories. The
average is done over the statistical distribution of initial conditions f , with
f chosen such as to closely reproduce the wave function in position or mo-
mentum space.

If f is to be stationary (as is the case here), it can depend only on con-
stants of the motion [9]. A largely employed choice is to make f depending
only upon the energy: f (r, p, t)
f (E). There is not an unique choice pos-
sible for f since–classically–does not exist any f such that both ρ and ˜ρ are
equal to their quantum mechanical counterpart. The choice is done on the
basis of mathematical simplicity and accuracy.

≡

Once a choice for f –and therefore for ρ, ˜ρ–is done, the calculations of the
previous section still hold: simply, they are to be repeated for an ensemble of
electrons, each of them is still obeying Newton’s equations, and in particular
follows a circular orbit. Therefore, eq. (10) is replaced by its average

where C stands for a normalization constant.

from which one obtains, after substitution in eq. (24),

2n2. This microcanonical distribu-
which is a real quantity only for r
≤
tion is largely used in classical calculations of ion–hydrogen scattering
processes for generating initial electron distributions, since it has the
property of correctly reproducing the true electron momentum distri-
bution ˜ρ [9].

(31)

All the integrals (26) may be performed analytically using the ρs of items
1-3. In table 1 I report the values for the polarizability obtained using 1–3,
together with the values from eqns. (8) and (10). It is clearly discernible
the slow convergence of αcl to αQM if compared, in particular, to α2 which
already at n = 1 is within 20% of the true value.
It is curious, on the
other hand, the behaviour of α3 which is always very close to αQM and, for
n = 4, 5 is the best approximation, but becomes worse at large ns. Another
point to remark is that, for large n, α1 and α2 become nearly equal, as it
should be from their deﬁnition. On the average, using any of the suggested
distributions allows at least to halve the error with respect to the results of
ref. [7].

4. - Conclusions

In ref.
[7] it is remarked that the main motivation of their work was to
show that some quantal results may be recovered, at least partially, within
a purely classical framework, provided only that the initial conditions be
chosen as compatible as possible with the laws of quantum mechanics. This
paper follows exactly that line of thought, being a reﬁnement of that work in
that the initial conditions have been chosen in a more correct manner, but
still remaining within a classical description of the system. One may wonder
if the price paid to have this greater accuracy is too high, since we used
exact wave–functions, which is equivalent to solve the quantum mechanical
problem. It is not so, since signiﬁcant improvements are obtained using no
matter which distribution, even that of eq. (31) which is based upon purely
classical considerations. The other two distributions have been chosen just
to provide the reader with a comparison. This is important for all these cases
where extracting the wave function is too diﬃcult and one is forced to resort
to approximations. As already pointed out in [7], it could be worth exploring
in some of such situations.

tality oﬀered by the Consorzio RFX is acknowledged.

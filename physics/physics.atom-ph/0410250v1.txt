Abstract. We present new results on the X-ray spectroscopy of multicharged argon, sulfur and chlorine obtained with the
Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Trap (ECRIT) in operation at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Villigen, Switzerland). We used
a Johann-type Bragg spectrometer with a spherically-bent crystal, with an energy resolution of about 0.4 eV. The ECRIT
itself is of a hybrid type, with a superconducting split coil magnet, special iron inserts which provides the mirror ﬁeld, and a
permanent magnetic hexapole. The high frequency was provided by a 6.4 GHz microwave emitter.

We obtained high intensity X-ray spectra of multicharged F-like to He-like argon, sulfur and chlorine with one 1s hole.
In particular, we observed the 1s2s 3S1 → 1s2 1S0 M1 and 1s2p 3P2 → 1s2 1S0 M2 transitions in He-like argon, sulfur and
chlorine with unprecedented statistics and resolution. The energies of the observed lines are being determined with good
accuracy using the He-like M1 line as a reference.

We surveyed the He-like M1 transition intensity as a function of the ECRIT working conditions. In particular we observed

the M1 intensity dependency on the coil current and on the injected microwave power.

INTRODUCTION

The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Trap (ECRIT) of
the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) has been set up with the
goal of producing narrow X-ray lines that would yield
the response function of the Bragg crystal spectrometer
with high accuracy [1]. Such a measurement is crucial
for the ongoing pionic hydrogen experiment at PSI [2,
3, 4]. For low- to medium-Z atoms, the E1 X-rays from
hydrogen-like ions and the M1 X-rays from helium-like
ions have an energy of a few keV, with a natural width
which is negligible compared to the expected resolution
of the Bragg crystal spectrometer. The ion kinetic energy
in an ECRIS is small: it is on the level of less than
1 eV [5, 6]. Because of this, a Doppler broadening of
less than 40 meV can be expected in transitions in the
3 keV energy range in He-like argon.

In 2002, the 1s2s 3S1 → 1s2 1S0 M1 X-ray transition
in He-like argon has been used to study the response
function of the Bragg crystal spectrometer with quartz

[10-1] and silicon [111] crystals [7]. In spring 2004, the
characterization of the spectrometer was completed with
the test of our whole set of crystals (quartz [10-1], quartz
[100] and silicon [111]) using the M1 transition line
from He-like argon, chlorine and sulfur. In addition, we
obtained X-ray spectra of highly-charged ions of these
elements with unprecedented statistics and resolution.

EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

The experimental set-up is almost identical to the 2002
run set-up described in Ref. [7]. It is composed of the
ECRIT source and of a Bragg crystal spectrometer cou-
pled to a position sensitive detector (see ﬁg. 1).

The ECRIT consists of a pair of a superconducting
split coil magnets (which, together with special iron
inserts, provides the mirror ﬁeld conﬁguration), of an
AECR-U style permanent hexapole magnet, and of a
6.4 GHz power regulated emitter. The mirror ﬁeld pa-

propose, we used a gas mixture of O2 and, respectively,
Ar, CHClF2 and SO2. Using the experience acquired in
the previous run, we adjusted a mixing ratio of around
1:9, with a total pressure in the plasma chamber of 3 −
4 · 10−7 mbar. In order to recognize the different charge
states, we used as an initial reference the Ka or Kb
lines
of the neutral gas, which are easily recognizable: they
are the brightest when only a few watts of HF power
are injected. Using known energy intervals, we were then
able to move the spectrometer to the region of the nearby
1s2s 3S1 → 1s2 1S0 M1 transition in the He-like ion, and
to observe it. We then optimized the different ECRIT
and spectrometer parameters in order to maximize the
line intensity in the detector. The typical illumination
time of the CCD chips before the readout is 1 min. Due
to the large intensity of the X-rays, this allows for a
sizeable probability of double hits for pixels near the
line peak. In order to reduce this effect and improve the
peak-to-background ratio, a densimet® collimator was
inserted at a distance of 150 mm from the center of the
plasma, leaving an aperture of 28 mm(h) × 4 mm(v) or
28 mm(h) × 1 mm(v), depending on the conﬁguration.
During the different runs the (double hits) to (single hits)
ratio always stayed below 5%, which is small enough to
properly handle double hits in the ﬁnal analysis, and to
neglect triple hit processes.

During the optimization of the apparatus, we studied
the M1 line intensity as a function of the injected HF
power. As expected, we observed a strong dependence
between the M1 intensity and the HF power (see ﬁg. 2).
In contrast, we noted an unexpected behavior of the max-
ima of the curves, whose HF intensity does not increase
with the ionization energy of the He-like ion.

rameters provide one of the highest mirror ratios for ECR
sources, with a value of 4.3 over the length of the plasma
chamber.

By using a cryopump and reducing the surface of
iron insertion pieces the reference pressure ( i.e. without
plasma) was reduced from 1.7 · 10−7 mbar (2002) to 3 ·
10−8 mbar Gas ﬁlling was supplied radially through the
gaps in the open structure hexapole. The gas composition
was routinely controlled and stabilized with a quadrupole
mass spectrometer.

A Bragg crystal spectrometer of

reﬂection type
(Johann conﬁguration) was installed at a distance of
2200 mm from the plasma center. Silicon and quartz
crystal have used for the 2004 run, with different Bragg
angle values. The crystals are 100 mm diameter circular
plates, with a thickness of 0.2–0.3 mm, and are spheri-
cally bent with a curvature radius of 2982.4 ± 0.6 mm,
by optical attachment to high-quality quartz spherical
lenses.

The detector is an array of 6 CCDs of 600 × 600 pixels
each [8], with an energy resolution of 140 eV at 3 keV.
The pixel size at working temperature (−100◦C) has
been recently measured to be 39.9943 ± 0.0035 m m [9].
The granularity of the detector was decisive in discrim-
inating charged particle events against X-rays possess-
ing different topologies. The CCD chips and the asso-
ciated electronics were protected against light and high-
frequency (HF) power by a 30 m m thick Beryllium win-
dow installed in the vacuum tube between the crystal
spectrometer and the ECRIT.

ECRIT at work

During spring 2004, we injected different kinds of
gases in the ECRIT in order to obtain X-ray spectra
from highly-charged argon, chlorine and sulfur. For this

agree with the previous experimental values and theoret-
ical predictions (see tables 1, 2).

OUTLOOK AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we demonstrated once more the possibility
of using high-precision X-ray spectroscopy with a Bragg
spectrometer in the study of ECR ion sources. Moreover,
we presented new results on X-ray transition energies in
highly-charged argon, chlorine and sulfur.

FIGURE 3. He-like argon M1 line intensity dependency ver-
sus the superconducting coils current. 55 A corresponds to a
magnetic ﬁeld value of 2.35 kG at the center of the ECRIT.

During the ECRIT parameters adjustment, we ob-
served a non-trivial dependency of the M1 intensity
against the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. As shown in
ﬁg. 3, we observe the presence of two distinct maxima
in the M1 intensity-coil current relationship.

Atomic Spectra

One of the most important goals of the spring 2004 run
was the high-precision measurement of the X-ray spec-
tra of argon, chlorine and sulfur. With 1–2 hours maxi-
mum acquisition time, we obtained high-statistics spec-
tra of He-, Li- and Be-like ionic states of these elements.
A crystal spectrometer like ours can only measure en-
ergy differences between atomic transitions. A reference
is thus needed. Due to the lack of high quality refer-
ence line in neutral atom X-ray spectra (see, e.g., [10])
we used as a reference He-like 1s2s 3S1 → 1s2 1S0 M1
transition. All the transition energies provided in the
present work are based on the M1 theoretical transition
energy calculated with a multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock
code [11, 12]. The peaks in the spectra were ﬁtted with
a simulated spectrometer response function which was
convoluted to a Gaussian. The response function was ob-
tained through a Monte Carlo X-ray tracking simulation
based on the theoretical reﬂection function of the crystal
obtained with the XOP code [13]. The reliability of the
simulation had previously been tested during the crys-
tal response function study [7]. The results obtained in
highly-charged argon and sulfur spectroscopy have an
unprecedented precision of the order of 10 meV and they

The next steps will consist in ﬁnishing the data analy-
sis of lower-charge states (Li- and Be-like) of argon and
sulfur, in analyzing the chlorine spectra and in studying
the injected HF power dependency of the satellite transi-
tion in the He-like ions spectra.

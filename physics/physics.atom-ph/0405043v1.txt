Manifestations of nuclear anapole moments in solid state NMR

We suggest to use insulating garnets doped by rare earth ions for measurements of nuclear anapole
moments. A parity violating shift of the NMR frequency arises due to the combined eﬀect of the
lattice crystal ﬁeld and the anapole moment of the rare-earth nucleus.

We show that there are two diﬀerent observable eﬀects related to frequency: 1) A shift of the
NMR frequency in an external electric ﬁeld applied to the solid. The value of the shift is about
∆ν1 ∼ 10−5 Hz with E = 10 kV/cm; 2) A splitting of the NMR line into two lines. The second
eﬀect is independent of the external electric ﬁeld. The value of the splitting is about ∆ν2 ∼ 0.5 Hz
and it depends on the orientation of the crystal with respect to magnetic ﬁeld. Both estimates are
presented for a magnetic ﬁeld of about 10 tesla.

We also discuss a radiofrequency electric ﬁeld and a static macroscopic magnetization caused by

the nuclear anapole moment.

INTRODUCTION

The anapole moment is a characteristic of a system which is related to the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁned within the
system. It was pointed out some time ago by Zeldovich [1] that the anapole moment is related to parity violation inside
the system. Interest in the nuclear anapole moment is mostly due to the fact that it gives dominating contribution
to eﬀects of atomic parity nonconservation (PNC) which depend on nuclear spin [2]. There are two mechanisms
that contribute to these eﬀects. The ﬁrst is due to exchange of a Z-boson between electron and nucleus. The
second mechanism is due to the usual magnetic interaction of an electron with the nuclear anapole moment. The
0.23
contribution of the ﬁrst mechanism is proportional to 1
[3], the ﬁrst mechanism is strongly suppressed and the second mechanism dominates. The anapole moment of 133Cs
has been measured in an optical PNC experiment with atomic Cs [4]. This is the only observation of a nuclear anapole
moment. There have been several diﬀerent suggestions for measurements of nuclear anapole moments. Measurements
in optical transitions in atoms or in diatomic molecules remains an option, for a review see [5]. Another possibility
is related to radiofrequency (RF) transitions in atoms or diatomic molecules [6, 7, 8, 9]. Possibilities to detect
nuclear anapole moments using collective quantum eﬀects in superconductors [10], as well as PNC electric current in
ferromagnets [11], have been also discussed in the literature. A very interesting idea to use Cs atoms trapped in solid
4He has been recently suggested in Ref. [12].

Our interest in the problem of the nuclear anapole moment in solids was stimulated by the recent suggestion for
searches of electron electric dipole moment in rare earth garnets [13]. Garnets are very good insulators which can
be doped by rare earth ions. They are widely used for lasers and their optical and crystal properties are very well
understood. To be speciﬁc we consider two cases: the ﬁrst is yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) doped by Tm [14].
Thulium 3+ ions substitute for yttrium 3+ ions. The second case is yttrium gallium garnet doped by Pr [15]. Once
more, praseodymium 3+ ions substitute for yttrium 3+ ions. The dopant ions have an uncompensated electron spin
J and a nuclear spin I. For Tm3+ J = 6 and I = 1/2 (169Tm, 100% abundance). For Pr3+ J = 4 and I = 5/2
(141Pr, 100% abundance).

The simplest P -odd and T -even correlation (P is space inversion and T is time reﬂection) which arises due to the

nuclear anapole moment is

where E is the external electric ﬁeld. It is convenient to use the magnitude of the eﬀect expected in the electron
electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment [13] as a reference point. For this reference point we use a value of the
10−27e cm. According to our calculations, the
electron EDM equal to the present experimental limit [16], de = 1.6

if the anapole-induced voltage of this frequency can be detected. An alternative possibility is to detect the static
variation of the perpendicular magnetization induced by the external electric ﬁeld, δI
E]. The magnetization
eﬀect for Pr3Ga5O12 is several times larger than that expected for the EDM experiment [13]. This probably makes
the magnetization eﬀect rather promising. In the present work we concentrate on the other possibility which is based
on the crystal ﬁeld of the lattice. Because of the crystal ﬁeld, the electron polarization of the rare earth ion has a

component orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld

Another eﬀect considered in the present work is the splitting of the NMR line into two lines due to the nuclear

anapole moment. This eﬀect is related to the lattice structure and is independent of the external electric ﬁeld.

The garnet lattice has a center of inversion. However, the environment of each rare earth ion is asymmetric
with respect to inversion. One can imagine that there is a microscopic helix around each ion. Since the lattice is
centrosymmetric, each unit cell has equal numbers of rare earth ions surrounded by right and left helices (there are 24
rare earth sites within the cell). The microscopic helix is characterized by a third rank tensor Tklm (lattice octupole).
Together with the nuclear anapole interaction this gives a correlation similar to (1), but the eﬀective “electric ﬁeld”
is generated now by the helix Ek ∝

TklmJlJm. So the eﬀective interaction is

The eﬀective interaction (3) produces a shift of the NMR line. The value of the shift is about 0.5 Hz at B = 10 T,
and the sign of the shift is opposite for sites of diﬀerent “helicity”, so in the end it gives a splitting of the NMR line

0.5 Hz.

The value of the splitting depends on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is the
“handle” which allows one to vary the eﬀect. Generically this eﬀect is similar to the PNC energy shift in helical
molecules [18].

One can easily relate the values of the frequency shift in the external ﬁeld (2) and of the line splitting (4). The
splitting is due to internal atomic electric ﬁeld which is about 109 V/cm. Therefore, naturally, it is about 5 orders of
magnitude larger than the shift (2) in ﬁeld 10 kV/cm.

For the present calculations we use the jelly model suggested in Ref. [17]. Values of the nuclear anapole moments
of 169Tm and 141Pr which we use in the present paper have been calculated separately [19]. The structure of the
present paper is as follows. In Section II the crystal structure of the compounds under consideration is discussed. The
eﬀective potential method used in our electronic structure calculations is explained in Section III. The most important
parts of the work which contain the calculations of the eﬀective Hamiltonians (1) and (3) are presented in Sections
IV and V. The crystal ﬁeld and the angle between the nuclear and the electron spin is considered in Section VI. In
section VII we calculate values of observable eﬀects and section VIII presents our conclusions. Some technical details
concerning the numerical solution of the equations for electron wave functions are presented in Appendix.

II. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF Y(Pr)GG AND Y(Tm)AG

The compounds under consideration are ionic crystals consisting of Y3+, O2−, Ga3+ ions for YGG and Al3+ instead
of Ga for YAG, plus Pr3+ or Tm3+ rare-earth doping ions. The chemical formula of YGG is Y3Ga5O12 and the formula
of YAG is Y3Al5O12. Yttrium gallium garnet and yttrium aluminium garnet belong to the Ia3d space group and
contain 8 formula units per unit cell. Detailed structural data for these compounds are presented in Table I [20, 21].
RE3+ doping ions replace Y3+ ions and hence enter the garnet structure in the dodecahedral 24c sites with the local
D2 symmetry. In this case each RE3+ ion is surrounded by eight oxygen O2− ions in the dodecahedron conﬁguration
resembling a distorted cube (see Fig. 1). There are 24 such sites per unit cell: half of them have absolutely identical
environment with the other half; the remaining 12 can be divided into 6 pairs where the sites diﬀer only by inversion,
and these 6 pairs diﬀer with each other by ﬁnite rotations. In the present paper we perform calculations for the
case of one particular site orientation; the coordinates of the oxygen atoms around the central impurity ion for that
instance are presented in Table II. After that, the results for all other sites in the unit cell can be found by applying
the inversion of coordinates or the necessary rotations, listed in Table III.

III. CALCULATION OF THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF RE·O8 CLUSTER

We describe an isolated impurity ion with the eﬀective potential in the following parametric form:

Here Z is the nuclear charge of the impurity ion, Zi is the charge of the electron core of ion, and µ, d and η are
parameters that describe the core. We use atomic units, expressing energy in units of E0 = 27.2 eV and distance
10−8 cm. Solution of the Dirac equation with the potential (5) gives wave
in units of the Bohr radius aB = 0.53
functions and energies of the single-electron states. The potential (5) provides a good ﬁt to the experimental energy
levels of isolated impurity ions [22]; the comparison is presented in Table IV.

V (r) = VRE(r) + VO(r),

where ro = 4.5 aB is the mean RE–O distance, Ao and D are parameters of the eﬀective potential. To describe the
electrons which contribute to the eﬀect we use the combined spherically symmetric potential

where VRE is the single impurity ion potential (5). Solution of the Dirac equation with potential (7) gives the single-
particle orbitals. In this picture we describe the electronic conﬁguration of the cluster as [RE3+]6s26p6, where the
electronic conﬁguration of Pr3+ is 1s2... 5s25p64f 2 and Tm3+ is 1s2... 5s25p64f 12. The eight states 6s26p6 represent
2pσ-electrons of oxygens combined to S- and P -waves with respect to the central impurity ion (see Ref. [17]). Parame-
ter Ao in the “oxygen” potential VO (6) is determined by matching the wavefunction of oxygen 2pσ-orbital (calculated
in Ref. [23]) with the 6s- and 6p-orbitals from the combined potential (7) at the radius R

The parameter D in (6) represents the size of the oxygen core and is about D <

1 (atomic units). The jelly model
is rather crude and the value of D cannot be determined precisely, see Ref. [17]. In the present work we vary this
parameter in the range of 0.1–1.5 . For each particular value of D we ﬁnd Ao to satisfy (8), for example Ao = 0.9 at
D = 1 . The most realistic value for D is probably around 0.5–1.0 . To be speciﬁc, in the ﬁnal answers we present
results at D = 1.0 . Instead of the jelly model it would certainly be better to use a relativistic quantum chemistry
Hartree-Fock method [25] (or the Kohn-Sham form of the relativistic density functional method which allows one to
generate electron orbitals) to describe the RE
O8 cluster. However, this would be a much more involved calculation

at the edge of present computational capabilities and therefore, at this stage, we continue with the jelly model.

IV. CALCULATION OF THE EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN (1)

The calculations in the present section are similar to those performed in [17] for the electric dipole moment of the
electron. There are three perturbation operators that contribute to the correlation (1). First, there is a magnetic
interaction of the electron with the nuclear anapole moment, see, e.g., [5]. Expressed in atomic units the interaction

FIG. 2: Schematic picture, illustrating the shift of VO(r) due to the lattice deformation.

The second perturbation operator is related to the shift ∆r of the rare earth ion with respect to the surrounding
oxygen ions. The shift is proportional to the external electric ﬁeld, but for now we consider ∆r as an independent

where V = Va + V1 + VC . In Eq. (13) we need to consider only the terms that contain all the operators Va, V1, and
VC .

The shift operator V1 is nearly saturated by 6s- and 6p-states because core electrons do not “see” the deformation
of the lattice, hence, for this operator we consider only s-p mixing. Matrix elements of the anapole operator Va
practically vanish for the electron states with high angular momentum, since this operator is proportional to the
Dirac delta function. Therefore, it is suﬃcient to take into account only
matrix elements. All in all,
there are 11 diagrams (Fig. 3) that correspond to Eq. (13). All diagrams are exchange ones and contribute with the

coeﬃcient A for the Pr3+ and Tm3+ ions (in the corresponding lattices) calculated at D = 1.0 in Eq. (6) reads:

The eleven terms in (18) represent the contributions of the eleven diagrams in Fig. 3. As one can see, there is
signiﬁcant compensation between diﬀerent terms in (18). This compensation is partially related to the fact that each
particular diagram in Fig. 3 contains contributions forbidden by the Pauli principle. These contributions are canceled
out only in the sum of the diagrams. To check (18) we have also performed a more involved calculation explicitly

Comparison between (18) and (19) is a test of the many body perturbation theory used in the calculation. To
demonstrate the sensitivity to parameters of the eﬀective potential, we plot in Fig. 4 the coeﬃcient A versus the
width D of the oxygen potential, see Eq. (6). As we pointed out in Section III, the most realistic value of D is around
0.5–1.0 . To be speciﬁc, in the ﬁnal estimates we use the results (18) and (19), which correspond to the value D = 1.0 .

V. CALCULATION OF THE EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN (3)

The P -odd eﬀective Hamiltonian considered in the previous section arises due to a shift of the environment with
respect to the rare earth ion. In other words, it is due to the ﬁrst harmonic in the electron density induced by the
perturbation operator V1 (11). In the equilibrium position the ﬁrst harmonic vanishes identically due to the symmetry
of the lattice. The next harmonic in the electron density that contributes to the parity nonconserving eﬀect is the
third harmonic which is nonzero even in the equilibrium position of the rare earth ion. This eﬀect gives the P -odd
energy shift even in the absence of an external electric ﬁeld.

The eﬀective oxygen potential VO (6) represents the spherically symmetric part of the real potential for electrons
created by the eight oxygen ions in the garnet lattice. Let us describe the potential (pseudopotential) of a single
oxygen ion as gδ(r

R), where R is the position of the ion and g is some constant. Then the total potential is

where summation is performed over the coordinates of the eight oxygen ions presented in Table II. Expanding the
Dirac delta function in the potential V (r) in a series of spherical harmonics, we ﬁnd

Similar to the “dipole” eﬀect considered in the previous section, the octupole eﬀect arises in the third order of
perturbation theory. The relevant perturbation theory operators are a) interaction of the electron with the nuclear
anapole moment Va (9), b) interaction of the electron with the lattice octupole harmonic V3 (23), and c) the residual
electron-electron Coulomb interaction VC (12). The formula for the energy correction (13) yields 7 diagrams which
are presented in Fig. 5.

Besides the coeﬃcients presented in Fig. 5, which show the number of diagrams of each kind, each particular
diagram in Fig. 5 contributes with its own angular coeﬃcient. In calculating the coeﬃcients we assumed, without loss
of generality, that the total angular momentum of 4f electrons is directed along the z-axis,
, and the nuclear
spin is directed along the y-axis, I = (0, I, 0). The angular coeﬃcients for each of the 7 diagrams from Fig. 5 are
presented in Table VIII in the Appendix. The method for separating the radial equations is also described in the
Appendix. The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the lattice octupole eﬀect has the following form

FIG. 5: Diagrams for the “octupole” eﬀect. The cross denotes the anapole interaction Va (9), the dashed line denotes the lattice
octupole V3 (24), and the wavy line denotes the Coulomb interaction VC (12). The multipolarity of the Coulomb interaction
is shown near the wavy line. Each diagram contributes with the coeﬃcient shown before the diagram (number of diagrams of
this kind). Summation over all intermediate states |ki and |mi and over all ﬁlled states |ni is assumed.

Eq. (26) represents the only P -odd scalar combination one can construct from the two vectors and one irreducible
third rank tensor. Note, that J here is an operator, and diﬀerent components of J do not commute. This is why
in the right hand side of Eq. (26) we explicitly write the Hermitian combination. The matrix element of (26) in the
kinematics which we consider for the calculation of the angular coeﬃcients (Table VIII) is

Our calculations show that contributions of the diagrams with the intermediate f -state (diagrams 4,5,6,7 in Fig. 5)
are at least 30 times smaller compared to diagrams 1 and 2. The reason for this is very simple: f -electrons are
practically decoupled from the lattice deformation. The diagram 3 is even smaller because internal 3d- and 4d-
electrons are also decoupled from the lattice. So, only diagrams 1 and 2 contribute to the eﬀect and they are
nearly saturated by the intermediate unoccupied 5d-state. The dimensionless coeﬃcient B for Pr and Tm ions in
corresponding lattices calculated at D = 1.0 [Eq. (6)] reads:

realistic value of D is around 0.5–1.0 . To be speciﬁc, in the estimates for the eﬀect we use D = 1.0 .

VI. CRYSTAL FIELD, AVERAGE ELECTRON MAGNETIZATION, ORIENTATION OF NUCLEAR

The energy of a free ion is degenerate with respect to the z-projection of total angular momentum. Interaction
with the lattice (crystal ﬁeld) breaks the rotational invariance and lifts the degeneracy. The eﬀective crystal-ﬁeld

Experimental values of the energy levels for Pr3+ in YGG and Tm3+ in YAG are known [14, 15], and ﬁts of the
crystal ﬁeld parameters Bkm have been performed in the experimental papers. Unfortunately, we cannot use these
ﬁts because they are performed without connection to a particular orientation of crystallographic axes. We need to
know the connection and therefore we have performed independent ﬁts. For the ﬁts we use a modiﬁed point-charge
model. In the simple point-charge model the crystal ﬁeld is of the form

The values of ρk are known [27]. The point charges are qO =

point-charge model is insuﬃcient to describe the nearest 8 oxygen ions because of the relatively large size of the ions
(extended electron density of the host oxygens). To describe the eﬀect of the extended electron density we introduce

here the sum runs over the eight oxygen ions surrounding the dopant ion in the garnet structure, and αk are ﬁtting

in f -electron splitting. In the end, we get a fairly good ﬁt of the experimental energy levels, see Table V. The values
of the resulting crystal ﬁeld parameters Bkm are presented in Table VI.

Unfortunately, the values of M are relatively small compared to the maximum possible value M = J (4 for Pr and 6

Ahf(J · I) is an order of magnitude larger than the direct magnetic interaction µµN (B · I)/I, while to maximize
M one has to have these interactions comparable. In spite of the suppression, the observable eﬀects related to the

The calculations in the present section are based on the ﬁt of experimental energy levels, Table V, using the crystal
ﬁeld parameters. We use the set of parameters presented in Table VI. Unfortunately, the set is not unique and there
are other sets which also reasonably ﬁt the energy levels. In particular, for Tm3+ in YAG there is a set of parameters
which gives a lattice octupole induced PNC energy shift an order of magnitude larger than the present set. At this
stage we prefer to continue with the conservative estimate. To elucidate the uncertainty related to the crystal ﬁeld
parameters detailed measurements of NMR frequencies, as well as transition amplitudes, are necessary.

VII. ESTIMATES OF OBSERVABLE EFFECTS

The eﬀect (1), (17) requires a displacement of the impurity ion from its equilibrium position. Such displacement can
be achieved by application of an external electric ﬁeld. The displacement has been estimated in Ref. [17] in relation
to the discussion of electric dipole moments. The idea behind the estimate is very simple. Since the Ga–O link in
YGG and the Al–O link in YAG are much more rigid than the Y–O links (see discussion in [17]) the electrostatic
polarization in YGG and YAG is mainly due to displacement of the yttrium ions

On the other hand, the dielectric polarization caused by the external electric ﬁeld E is

where the static dielectric constant is ǫ
ment of the yttrium ions:

≈

12 for YGG and YAG. This yields the following expression for the displace-

Measurements of infrared spectra, as well as measurements of the dependence of the dielectric constant on the
concentration of impurities, can help to improve the estimate (46).

Using (17), together with (41) and (46), we obtain the following estimates for the NMR frequency shift (∆I = 1)

due to the nuclear anapole moment:

An alternative possibility for the experiment is to provide the maximum possible value of the cross product I
by applying an RF pulse and then to measure the induced electric ﬁeld. Using (17), together with estimates of the

The ﬁeld precesses around the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld with a frequency of about 1 GHz due to the nuclear
spin precession. In the estimates (48) we assume that all yttrium ions are substituted by the rare earth ions.

Another manifestation of nuclear anapole moment is the static perpendicular macroscopic magnetization induced

by an external electric ﬁeld,

The exact value of the macroscopic magnetization depends on temperature and other experimental conditions, there-
fore we cannot present a speciﬁc value. However, we can compare the eﬀect with that expected in the electron EDM
10−27e cm, as a
experiment [13] (correlation δJ
reference point. The eﬀective anapole interaction (17) is four order of magnitude larger than the similar eﬀective
EDM interaction [17]. On the other hand, the electron EDM interaction causes electron magnetization whereas the
anapole interaction causes only nuclear magnetization, so we lose 3 orders of magnitude on the value of the magnetic
moment. Therefore, altogether, one should expect that the anapole magnetization is several times larger than the
EDM magnetization.

The eﬀective interaction (26) is independent of the external electric ﬁeld and is due to the asymmetric environment
of the rare earth ion site. Since there is always another site within the unit cell which is the exact mirror reﬂection
of the ﬁrst one, the energy correction (26) does actually lead to the NMR line splitting. Using Eqs. (26), (28), (42),
and (43), we ﬁnd the maximum value of this splitting corresponding to the magnetic ﬁeld B = 10 T:

The splitting depends on the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the crystallographic axes, see Fig. 8.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we have considered eﬀects caused by the nuclear anapole moment in thulium doped yttrium
aluminium garnet and praseodymium doped yttrium gallium garnet. There are two eﬀects related to the frequency
of NMR: 1) NMR line shift in combined electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The shift is about 10−5 Hz at B = 10 T and
E = 10 kV/cm. 2) NMR line splitting (magnetic ﬁeld only). The spitting is about 0.5 Hz at B = 10 T. The value of
the splitting depends on the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the crystallographic axes. Another PNC
eﬀect is the induced RF electric ﬁeld orthogonal to the plane of the magnetic ﬁeld and nuclear spin, E

10−6 V/cm at magnetic ﬁeld B = 5–10 T. The last eﬀect we have discussed is unrelated to NMR.

The operator ˆΦ represents the angular part of the perturbation ˆVp, and Rf and Rg are the radial parts of the

Having separated the radial parts, one can calculate the angular coeﬃcients for the diagrams in Figs. 3 and 5. The
results of these calculations are presented in Table VIII. The electronic conﬁgurations of Pr3+ and Tm3+ are similar:

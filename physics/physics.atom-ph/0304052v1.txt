We study three-body recombination in an optically trapped ultracold gas of cesium atoms with
precise magnetic control of the s-wave scattering length a. At large positive values of a, we measure
the dependence of the rate coeﬃcient on a and conﬁrm the theoretically predicted scaling propor-
tional to a4. The observation of recombination heating provides evidence of the formation of very
weakly bound molecules in the last bound energy level.

Three-body recombination, the process of two particles
forming a compound while interacting with a third parti-
cle, is of general importance in many-body systems. Un-
derstanding three-body processes has for a long time been
a challenge in many areas of physics. In dilute ultracold
atomic gases, where unique experimental access to inter-
particle interactions is available, three-body recombina-
tion leads to the formation of diatomic molecules. The
possibility to trap and cool such molecules and thus to re-
alize ultracold molecular ensembles [1] or atom-molecule
mixtures [2] holds great prospects for future research in
the ﬁeld of quantum gases.

The main experimental challenge for measuring three-
body recombination is to distinguish three-body losses
from two-body losses. In magnetic traps, this is in gen-
eral diﬃcult, as dipolar relaxation is present as an inher-
ent two-body loss mechanism. In the special case of mag-
netically trapped 87Rb, experiments could nevertheless
provide reliable data because of the anomalously weak
two-body decay in this species [3, 4]. As a more general
approach, optical traps allow to store atoms in the low-
est internal state where two-body loss is fully suppressed
for energetic reasons [5]. Three-body recombination in
bosonic systems with large s-wave scattering length a
has been explored in experiments utilizing Feshbach res-
onances in 23Na [6] and 85Rb [7]. The results demon-
strate the dramatic enhancement of loss processes near
such resonances.

In the case of large positive a, theoretical studies
[8, 9, 10, 11] predict formation of molecules in a weakly
bound s level and deduce scaling of the three-body re-
combination rate with a to the fourth power. Recombina-
tion is discussed in terms of the event rate νrec = αrecn3
per unit volume and time, where n denotes the parti-
cle density. In the low-energy limit, the universal scal-
ing law for the characteristic parameter αrec is given as
αrec = C¯ha4/m [8], where m is the mass of the atom, and
C a dimensionless factor. Predictions for C give values
between 0 and
70 [8, 9, 10, 11], with oscillatory behav-
ior between C = 0 and Cmax = 67.9 expected for strong
variations of a on a Feshbach resonance [11]. Previously
available experimental data on three-body recombination
for various species roughly agree with the general trend of

∼

a universal a4 scaling, with evidence for deviations from
this scaling law near a Feshbach resonance [6].

In this work, we employ an optical trap to measure
three-body recombination in an ultracold thermal gas
of 133Cs in the 62S1/2, F = 3, mF = 3 absolute ground
state. In this state, the scattering length varies strongly
with an applied magnetic ﬁeld B through a combination
of broad and narrow Feshbach resonances at low ﬁeld
strengths [12, 13]. The values of a as a function of B
have been calculated to high precision [14]. This tun-
ability allows us to conduct experiments in a range of
precisely controlled large positive values of a, where the
condition of recombination into a weakly bound s level
is well fulﬁlled. Detailed measurements of the time evo-
lution of both atom number and temperature allow us to
quantify both three-body loss and heating.

The three-body loss rate coeﬃcient L3 is related to αrec
via L3 = nlαrec, where nl denotes the number of atoms
lost from the trap per recombination event. Therefore,
the central relationship for comparing measurements to
theory is

L3 = nlC

a4.

In the recombination process the molecular binding en-
ergy ε is set free as kinetic energy. The molecule and the
third atom receive ε/3 and 2ε/3, respectively. Since usu-
ally ε is large compared to the trapping potential depth,
both are expelled from the trap, setting nl = 3. How-
ever, the binding energy of the weakly bound last energy
(cid:1) [15], and at
level of the dimer is given by ε = ¯h
very large scattering length values ε may be below the
trap depth and the third atom cannot escape. If the po-
tential of the atom trap does not conﬁne the molecule,
the dimer is lost and nl = 2. If, however, the molecule is
trapped and stays within the atom cloud, it may quickly
quench its high vibrational excitation in an inelastic col-
lision with a fourth trapped atom. The large amount of
energy released in this situation expels the collision part-
ners, making nl = 3. In either case, the kinetic energy of
the remaining atom is distributed in the ensemble, giving
rise to recombination heating.

Our measurements are conducted in a nearly isotropic

laser beams focused to a waist of 600 µm [16]. A vertical
magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 31 G/cm cancels gravity for
the 62S1/2, F = 3, mF = 3 absolute ground state of Cs.
The optical trapping forces are so weak that no other
mF substate can be held against the gravitational force,
thus perfect spin polarization of the sample is enforced
by the trap itself. We have measured the trap frequencies
by exciting small oscillations along the principal axes, the
geometric average results to ¯ω/(2π) = 14.5

After loading the dipole trap [16], the ensemble cools
down by plain evaporation within the ﬁrst 10 s to

In a ﬁrst set of measurements, we have recorded the
atom number and temperature of the trapped sample af-
ter a holding time of 10 s at ﬁxed magnetic ﬁelds varied
between 10 G and 100 G [17]. Figure 1 shows the data
in comparison to the calculated scattering length [14],
which includes Feshbach resonances involving s- and d-
wave channels. Additional resonances involving closed
g-wave channels are marked by arrows. The Feshbach
resonances have been observed in previous experiments
through light-induced two-body losses [13, 18] and de-
scribed theoretically [12, 18]. In our measurements, all
resonances appear as prominent loss and heating fea-
tures. Over the full range, both atom number and tem-
perature show a clear correlation with the magnitude of
the scattering length.

for each lost atom an excess energy of 1kBT remains in
the sample. To account for recombination heating, we
introduce an additional constant energy kBTh per lost

Equations (2) and (3) form a set of two coupled nonlin-
ear diﬀerential equations for N and T . Using an iterative
approach [20], we do a least-squares ﬁt of the numerical
solutions of both equations to the experimental data. For
the data in Fig. 2, the ﬁt is plotted as solid lines. Fit pa-
rameters are α, γ and Th. The ﬁt procedure works well
when the recombination rate is high enough for the decay
curve to show a clear three-body signature, useful data
are obtained when a >
1000 a0. An error estimate for γ
∼
is based on varying the parameter up and down, resp., to
the points where the error sum of squares is twice as large
as at the minimum, again using the iterative procedure.
The same approach yields the error limits for Th.

The data obtained for L3 as a function of magnetic ﬁeld
is plotted in Fig. 3. The inset shows an expanded view
of data taken on the 48 G Feshbach resonance. The error

3

bars represent the statistical errors derived from the ﬁt
as described above. The systematic uncertainty is larger:
Due to the scaling of L3 with N 2 ¯ω6, small errors in these
values amount to large diﬀerences in the result obtained
for L3. Taking the uncertainty in the trap frequency and
an estimated 30% in atom number, the systematic error
can be up to a factor of two.

In order to compare our data to theory, we do a least-
squares ﬁt of the expected scaling law [Eq. (1)] to our
measurements, using the calculated a(B) [14]. Single ﬁt
parameter is nlC. The resulting curve is drawn as a solid
line in Fig. 3. The data clearly conﬁrm the universal a4
scaling.
In our experimental range, where a varies by
less than a factor of two, we do not ﬁnd any indication
of resonant behavior in C [22]. The result from the ﬁt
is nlC = 220, corresponding to C = 73 for nl = 3 or
C = 110 for nl = 2. In comparison to theory, both values
are somewhat above the upper limit of Cmax
70, but
in good agreement within our systematic error limit.

The inset in Fig. 3 shows the data on the 48 G Fesh-
bach resonance. In order to model the shape of the loss
feature, we have to take into account the width of the
sample in the vertical B ﬁeld gradient and the unitarity
limitation at the ﬁnite temperature. The theory curve
is convoluted with a gaussian of full 1/e width 260 mG,
which is given by the vertical extension of the n3 dis-
tribution of the trapped sample. A cutoﬀ in a accounts
for the unitarity limitation; the cutoﬀ value of 1800 a0
results from a least-squares ﬁt to the data. Our B-ﬁeld
scale is slightly adjusted for an optimum match with the-
ory by introducing a 40 mG shift, which is well within
our calibration accuracy.

at 200 nK, k−1 = 2250 a0. Correspondingly, the 450 nK
data on the Feshbach resonance show a strong eﬀect from
the unitarity limitation, while the data taken at 200 nK
starting conditions follow the expected scaling law up to

Our results on recombination heating are displayed
in Fig. 4. A trend towards smaller Th at higher mag-
netic ﬁelds, corresponding to higher scattering lengths
a, is clearly visible. At large values of a close to the
Feshbach resonance, the values are correspondingly very
small. We compare the data to the scenario that the re-
combination heating arises just from the binding energy
ε of the last bound state of the dimer. As the atom in-
volved in the three-body recombination process receives
2ε/3, the recombination heat per lost atom results to
kBTh = 2ε/(3nl). Therefore, we assume kBTh to be be-
tween 2ε/9 (nl = 3) and ε/3 (nl = 2). This range is
shown as shaded area in Fig. 4 [23]. This simple model
shows reasonable agreement with the experimental data
within the error margins. Our heating measurements
thus provide evidence of the formation of very weakly

From the observation of recombination heating, we can
draw an important conclusion for the eﬃciency of evapo-
rative cooling towards quantum degeneracy in gases with
large positive scattering length. If temperatures are very
ε) and the atom that carries 2ε/3 cannot
low (kBT
immediately escape from the trap, recombination heat-
ing has a detrimental eﬀect much worse than mere three-
body loss. For eﬃcient evaporation it is thus impera-
tive to avoid the hydrodynamic collision regime and to
implement a three-dimensional evaporation scheme. In
our cooling experiments on optically trapped cesium [16]
these conditions indeed turned out to be essential for the
attainment of Bose-Einstein condensation.

The molecules formed in recombination are likely to re-
main trapped in our setup. A previous experiment shows
evidence of trapping of the Cs2 dimer in a CO2-laser
trap [25]. Away from Feshbach resonances, the magnetic
dipole moment of the dimer in its last bound state has
the same value as the sum of the dipole moments of two
single Cs atoms, so that the levitation trap can hold the
molecules under the same conditions as the atoms. This
oﬀers an intriguing way to study atom-molecule interac-
tions both in ultracold thermal clouds and Bose-Einstein
condensates. Moreover, the Feshbach resonances allow to
change the molecular magnetic moment in a controlled
way and thus to separate the molecules from the atoms
to prepare pure molecular samples.

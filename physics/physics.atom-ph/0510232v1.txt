Abstract

For the interactions between a He(2 3S) atom and a He(2 3P ) atom for like isotopes, we report

calculations of the coeﬃcients determining the potential energies at large internuclear separations.

Using accurate variational wave functions in Hylleraas coordinates we evaluate the coeﬃcient C3

of the resonant dipole-dipole energy, and the van der Waals coeﬃcients C6, C8, and C10 of the

energies arising from the mutual perturbations of instantaneous electric dipole, quadrupole, and

octupole interactions. We establish deﬁnitive values including treatment of the ﬁnite nuclear mass

for the 3He(2 3S)–3He(2 3P ) and 4He(2 3S)–4He(2 3P ) interactions.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the study of helium dimers and ultracold

helium collisions associated with metastable helium atoms [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

Molecular lines of the helium dimers associated with the He(2 3S)–He(2 3P ) asymptotes have

been produced by photoassociation of spin-polarized metastable helium atoms He(2 3S1).
In the purely long-range 0+

u potential well (with a minimum internuclear distance reaching
150 bohr) associated with the He(2 3S1)–He(2 3P0) asymptote, bound states of the helium

dimer [1, 2, 5] can be used in measurements of the s-wave scattering length for collisions of

two 4He(2 3S1) atoms [4, 7]. Molecular lines to the red of the D2 atomic transition in helium
dimers associated with the He(2 3S)–He(2 3P2) asymptote are of interest for control of the

scattering length using an “optical Feshbach resonance” [4, 6]. Published data are scarce on

the long-range part of the He(2 3S)–He(2 3P ) potential energies, which determine the energy

level structures of the the ultralong-range dimers formed in photoassociation of ultracold

metastable helium atoms.

In this paper, we present calculations of the coeﬃcients determining the potential ener-

gies at large internuclear separations. Using accurate variational wave functions in Hylleraas

coordinates we evaluate the coeﬃcient C3 of the resonant dipole-dipole energy, and the van

der Waals coeﬃcients C6, C8, and C10 of the energies arising from the mutual perturbations

of instantaneous electric dipole, quadrupole, and octupole interactions. We establish deﬁni-

tive values including treatment of the ﬁnite nuclear mass for the 3He(2 3S)–3He(2 3P ) and

4He(2 3S)–4He(2 3P ) interactions. Deﬁnitive values for the C6, C8, and C10 coeﬃcients are

established.

In this work, atomic units are used throughout. For the He(2 3S)–He(2 3P ) system, the

zeroth-order wave function appropriate for the perturbation calculation of the long-range

interaction can be written in the form [12]:

Ψ(0)(M,

) =

±

1
√2

[Ψna(σ)Ψnb(1M; ρ)

Ψna(ρ)Ψnb(1M; σ)] ,

(1)

±

where Ψna is the metastable He(2 3S) wave function, Ψnb is the wave function for the He(2 3P )

atom with magnetic quantum number M, σ and ρ are the collection of coordinates of the

two helium atoms in the laboratory reference frame, and the “

” sign indicates the gerade

and ungerade states. The corresponding zeroth-order energy is E(0)

nb . At
large internuclear distances, the interaction potential between the two helium atoms can be

) diﬀer from those given in Refs. [2] and

[5]. The origins of these discrepancies are uncertain. Drake [14] tabulated the oscillator

strengths of helium, including 3He and 4He. In order to extract the square of the transition

matrix element connecting 2 3S and 2 3P , besides some numerical constants, the tabulated

value should be multipied by 1 + 2me/mn and divided by the transition energy corrected

for the ﬁnite nuclear mass. Our results are in perfect agreement with Drake’s values such

obtained. For C6(M,

), our values diﬀer from the values used in the work of Venturi et

al. [5] at the level of 0.8% and 0.9% respectively for C6(0,

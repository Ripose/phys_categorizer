We have made a high resolution study of the specularity of the atomic reﬂection from an evanescent
wave mirror using velocity selective Raman transitions. We have observed a double structure in the
velocity distribution after reﬂection: a peak consistent with specular reﬂection and a diﬀuse reﬂection
pedestal, whose contribution decreases rapidly with increasing detuning. The diﬀuse reﬂection is
due to two distinct eﬀects: spontaneous emission in the evanescent wave and a roughness in the
evanescent wave potential whose amplitude is smaller than the de Broglie wavelength of the reﬂected
atoms.

Atomic mirrors are key components in the growing ﬁeld
of atom optics, and have been intensively studied by sev-
eral groups in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. For
interferometric and lithographic applications, it is par-
ticularly important to ensure that the reﬂection at the
mirror is specular, since diﬀuse scattering amounts to a
loss of spatial coherence and consequently to a reduction
of fringe visibility or focusing sharpness. Thus much in-
terest has been devoted to measuring and improving the
roughness of atomic mirrors, using static or time depen-
dent magnetic ﬁelds [2, 3, 4, 9], evanescent waves [1] or
other techniques [6].

Most of the above mentioned experiments consisted in
preparing an initial narrow velocity distribution, trans-
verse to the direction of incidence, and measuring the
broadening of this distribution due to the reﬂection. The
eﬀect of the mirror was characterized by a single quantity,
the rms increase in the width of the velocity distribution
attributable to the mirror. This increase was sometimes
also given in terms of an eﬀective rms angular deviation
from a perfectly ﬂat surface. In those experiments how-
ever, the resolution only allowed a measurement of the
broadening of the atomic velocity distribution due the
mirror.
In this paper we present an experiment using
velocity selective stimulated Raman transitions to pre-
pare a very narrow initial velocity distribution [10], and
to measure the distribution after reﬂection. For the ﬁrst
time we are able to resolve a ﬁnal velocity distribution
which is not merely broadened, but qualitatively modi-
ﬁed upon reﬂection.

Much in analogy with the reﬂection of light from an
optical mirror, we observe a double structure, with a
narrow peak and a broad pedestal. The narrow peak
corresponds to specularly reﬂected atoms. The broad
pedestal corresponds to diﬀuse atomic reﬂection which
has two origins: spontaneous emission and mirror rough-
ness. If we assume that the roughness of the mirror can
be viewed as a random process with variance σ2 and a
correlation length much shorter than the mirror itself,
[11, 12] that the fraction S of specu-
one readily ﬁnds
w, reminiscent of
larly reﬂected atoms is given by exp
the Debye-Waller factor, with w = 16π2σ2/λ2
dB, where
λdB is the de Broglie wavelength of the incident mat-
ter wave (8 nm in our experiment). The presence of a

−

signiﬁcant specular peak implies an eﬀective [18] mirror
roughness smaller than λdB.

We have studied the ratio of these two components as
a function of various parameters and shown in particu-
lar that the diﬀuse component rapidly decreases when
the atomic evanescent wave detuning increases. These
observations also allow us to examine diﬀerent possible
mechanisms for the diﬀuse reﬂection involving either mir-
ror roughness or spontaneous emission.

In our experiment we use an evanescent wave mirror,
identical to the one described in Ref. [13]. We use a su-
perpolished prism of TaFD30 glass [19] (refractive index
n1 = 1.869). The rms surface roughness given by the
manufacturer is 0.07 nm. The input and output faces
for the laser beam which creates the evanescent wave are
coated with a broadband AR reﬂection coating. A Ti:S
laser of wavelength λL = 2π/kL = 780 nm generates
the evanescent wave with an incident angle θ1 = 53◦.
The evanescent electric ﬁeld thus has a decay constant
of κ = kLqn2
1 = 1.11kL, and a propagation
vector of magnitude kx = kLn1 sin θ1 = 1.49kL. We have
deﬁned the x-axis to be along the evanescent wave prop-
agation direction. The Ti:S laser is TM (p) polarized and
its waist is about 0.9 mm along the x and z-axes at the
surface of the prism.

Our 85Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT) is similar to
that described in Ref. [13]. Every 1.5 s, we collect about
108 atoms in the trap. By turning oﬀ the repumping
beam just before (after) the trapping beams, we prepare
the atoms in the
) level.

Velocity selective Raman transitions between F = 2
and F = 3 hyperﬁne levels are induced by a pair
of counter-propagating laser beams detuned from the
one photon atomic resonance by about 1 GHz (∆ in
Fig. 1) [10]. Because of the Doppler eﬀect, the resonance
condition for a two photon Raman transition depends
on the atomic velocity and is given by δ = 2k(v + vrec),
ω23 is the detuning of the Raman
where δ = ωa −
beams from the hyperﬁne transition, v = v.ka/ka is the
projection of the atomic velocity on the Raman beam di-
rection, and vrec is the one photon recoil velocity of Rb,
6 mm/s. By varying the detuning δ, we can choose the

magnetic ﬁeld oriented along the beam propagation di-
rection lifts the degeneracy of the Zeeman levels in the
F = 2 and F = 3 manifolds. Atoms which are not in
the mF = 0 state are out of Raman resonance and make
no transitions. The Raman beams propagate at 43◦ with
respect to the evanescent wave propagation vector in the
xz-plane. It is therefore necessary to rotate the magnetic
ﬁeld adiabatically while the atoms fall to the mirror in
order that they be in an eigenstate of the polarization
(nearly circular) of the evanescent wave. After reﬂection
the magnetic ﬁeld is turned back to coincide with the
propagation direction of the Raman beams.

To generate the Raman beams (separated by ω23/2π =
3.036 GHz), we modulate the injection current of a free
1 side-
running diode laser at 1.5 GHz and inject the
bands into two slave laser diodes (each diode is injected
by one sideband). Before injection, the laser beam passes
through a Fabry-Perot cavity of 3 GHz spectral range,
a ﬁnesse of 130, and locked to the two sideband wave-
lengths to ﬁlter out the carrier wavelength and the
2
sidebands. After injection, each Raman beam passes
through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). An arbi-
trary function generator modulates these AOMs to pro-
duce Blackman pulses [14] of the desired duration. Ob-
servation of the beat note between the two slave laser
beams indicates a relative frequency spread less than
20 Hz (equal to the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum
analyser) suﬃciently narrow that the Raman transition
width is not limited by the Raman phase coherence.

To test our setup, we ﬁrst make a velocity selection
and immediately analyse it with a second Raman pulse.
At t = 0, we prepare the atoms in the F = 3 state. At
t = 8 ms we apply a Raman π pulse with a detuning δS
. Then comes a pushing beam
to transfer atoms to
i
5P3/2F ′ = 4 transi-
resonant with the 5S1/2F = 3
tion which removes all the atoms remaining in F = 3. At
t = 22 ms we apply a second Raman “analysis” π pulse
with a detuning δA to transfer atoms back to
. The
i
atoms in the F = 3 level are detected via the ﬂuorescence
induced by a retroreﬂected probe laser resonant with the
5P3/2F ′ = 4 transition and collected in
5S1/2F = 3
a 0.1 sr solid angle on a photomultiplier tube. No re-
pumper is present in order to avoid detection of atoms in
the F = 2 level.

We repeat the sequence with a diﬀerent value of δA
in order to acquire the transverse velocity distribution of
incident atoms (Figure 2(a)). The half width at 1/√e
of the distribution is 7.3 kHz. This width is consistent
with what is expected for a 150 µs Blackman pulse. The
curve demonstrates a velocity selection width for a single
pulse of 0.33 vrec (HW at 1/√e) along the propagation
direction of the Raman beams. This is about 20 times
narrower than the velocity width in the MOT. Because

2

the analysis sequence has the same resolution as the selec-
tion sequence, our velocity resolution is √2 times larger,
that is 0.47 vrec. This resolution is 3 times better than
what was used in Ref. [1].

with the probe laser and the repumper.

To observe the eﬀect of the reﬂection on the transverse
velocity, we proceed in a manner analogous to that de-
scribed above (see Fig. 1). At t = 0 we prepare the atoms
in the F = 2 level. The Raman selection pulse transfers
a narrow velocity class to
at t = 8 ms. The atoms

then fall onto the mirror. The frequency of the evanes-
cent wave is tuned to the blue of the F = 3 resonance
to the excited state of the D2 line, and to the red of the
F = 2 resonance. Atoms in F = 2 do therefore not re-
ﬂect from the mirror. After reﬂection (t = 120 ms), the
analysis pulse transfers some atoms back into
. Next
i
the pushing beam removes the atoms remaining in the
F = 3 level and ﬁnally we detect the atoms transferred
to

Atoms which have not been selected by the ﬁrst Raman
selection pulse can contribute to a background if they
happen to be pumped into the
state (by the evanes-
cent wave, for example) during their trajectory. We mea-
sure this background using the same sequence described
just above with the selection detuning δS tuned far from
resonance. In our data acquisition we alternate between
normal and background measurements and subtract the
background on each shot. The detuning of the analysis
pulse δA is scanned randomly over the desired values, and
we acquire and average about 3 measurements for each
value of δA to acquire a spectrum such as that shown in
Fig. 2(b). The peak value in Fig. 2(b) corresponds to
about 104 atoms detected per bounce. Typical values of
103
the background in this case correspond to about 3
atoms. Despite this subtraction, we observe a non-zero
background in Figs. 2 and 3. This background appears
to be due to atoms which reﬂect from the mirror but are
pumped into the F = 2 state after reﬂection.

With this system, we ﬁrst checked that the atoms obey
the law of reﬂection, that is the reﬂected angle is equal
to the incident one. We vary the mean velocity of the
initial distribution by choosing an appropriate δS, and
verify that the center of the reﬂected velocity distribution
varies by the same amount. We have noted a non-zero
intercept of this linear dependence which we attribute
to a slight tilt (about 1◦) in the mirror relative to the
horizontal.

For a reﬂection to be regarded as truly specular, the
velocity distribution must remain unchanged after reﬂec-
tion. Figure 2(b) shows the velocity distribution (the
number of atoms detected in the F = 2 state after the Ra-
man analysis pulse) after the bounce. One distinguishes a
narrow peak whose width appears identical to the initial
one, and a broad pedestal whose center is shifted by 7.9
kHz, an amount corresponding to a 0.5¯hkL momentum
transfer with respect to the narrow one along the obser-
vation direction. This transfer is in the same direction
as the evanescent wave propagation vector, and remains
so when the evanescent wave (Ti:S) laser direction is re-

versed (that is it also reverses).

In an attempt to understand the origin of the pedestal,
we acquired several reﬂected velocity distributions under
diﬀering conditions; two examples are shown in Fig. 3.
Each such distribution is ﬁtted to a sum of two Gaussians
plus a ﬂat background. We ﬁrst examined the parame-
ters of the pedestal as a function of the evanescent wave
detuning ∆EW. We observed little variation of the width
and the shift relative to the narrow peak. To simplify the
study of the relative contribution of the two components,
we ﬁxed the width of the narrow peak at the measured
width of the resolution function. We also ﬁxed the width
of the pedestal and the shift at the average values of our
preliminary ﬁts: the pedestal width was ﬁxed to be that
of the convolution of our resolution function and a Gaus-
sian of 18 kHz rms and the shift to be 7.9 kHz. Using
this analysis we can measure the fraction S of atoms de-
tected in the narrow peak as a function of ∆EW. (See
Fig. 4.) The data are well ﬁt by S = exp(
α/∆EW)
with α = 1.1 GHz.

The above detuning dependence immediately suggests
spontaneous emission within the evanescent wave which
reduces the numbre of specluarly reﬂected atoms by a
NSE). A simple estimate of NSE, the
factor of exp (
average number of spontaneous emissions, is given by
NSE = 2π/(λdBκ)
Γ/∆EW, where Γ/2π = 5.9 MHz is
the natural linewidth of the atomic transition [8, 15].
A better estimate includes the modiﬁcation of the po-
tential due to the van der Waals interaction [16], the
modiﬁcation of the spontaneous emission rate close to
the surface [17], and an average of these eﬀects over the
mirror surface. We ﬁnd, in our range of detunings, that
−1
EW to a good approximation but
NSE still varies as ∆
with a probability about 1.5 times higher. To calculate
S one must also take into account the fact that at large
detunings the branching ratio for falling back into the
F = 3, mF = 0 state, the only one which we detect, is
2/3. This factor cancels the increase in NSE due to the
eﬀects of the dielectric surface. One predicts therefore
S = exp(
αSE/∆EW) with αSE = 0.55 GHz. There ap-
pears to be too little spontaneous emission (by a factor
of 2) to entirely explain our results.

−

In addition, spontaneous emission in the evanescent
wave should result in an average momentum transfer of
¯hkx along x, that is, a shift of the broad pedestal of
cos(43◦) = 1.1¯hkL along the Raman beam direction
¯hkx ×
instead of the 0.5¯hkL that we observe. This observation
conﬁrms the above conclusion that spontaneous emission
in the evanescent wave is only partly responsible for our
observations. This is in contrast to the study of Ref. [8]
which used a very small value of κ to get a large number
of spontaneous emissions in the evanescent wave.

Another mechanism which causes diﬀuse reﬂection is
discussed in Ref. [12].
It involves scattered Ti:S light
which interferes with the evanescent wave. The interfer-
ence produces a rough potential which diﬀusely scatters
the atoms. This mechanism does not involve spontaneous
emission. The scattered light could come either from

3

−

the surface roughness, inhomogeneities in the bulk of the
prism or some other object such as a prism edge. Using
the results in Ref. [12] one can show that the propagat-
ing modes of the scattered light would cause S to vary
as exp(
αR/∆EW). Where αR depends on the amount
of scattered light. The pedestal due to this eﬀect should
exhibit no shift relative to the specular peak. Since spon-
taneous emission is responsible for about one half the
pedestal, we expect a pedestal shifted by about one half
of the shift due to spontaneous emission alone in good
agreement with our observations. Since both eﬀects have
the same ∆EW dependence the observed shift should not
depend on the detuning.

Another possible explanation for the pedestal is spon-
taneous emission induced by the stray light above the
prism while the atoms fall towards the mirror. Indeed,
in experiments in which we left the evanescent wave laser
on for 40 ms while the atoms fell towards the mirror, we
observed an optical pumping of the atoms from their ini-
tial hyperﬁne state (F=3) to the other hyperﬁne state
(F=2) (about 10% of the atoms were lost in this way
at ∆EW = 940 MHz). This mechanism predicts that S
should vary as exp
EW, where β is a constant which
depends on the mean light intensity experienced by the
atoms. As shown in Fig. 4 the data are not consistent
with this dependence.

β/∆2

−

Thus we believe that we have identiﬁed the source of
the diﬀuse reﬂection in our experiment as the sum the
eﬀects of the scattering of atoms from a potential in-
duced by the random interference pattern of the evanes-
cent wave and stray light, and spontaneous emission in
the evanescent wave. According to this interpretation
we have 1.1 GHz = αR + αSE and we can work out the
eﬀective mirror roughness associated with αR. We ﬁnd
σ
0.3 nm, a value much larger than the prism’s mea-
sured surface roughness (0.07 nm). Since the eﬀective
mirror roughness due to light scattering by the prism
surface is of the order of the surface roughness itself [12],
we presume that most of the stray light is from other
sources.

≈

We turn now to an analysis of the narrow peak. Since
the area under the broad peak can be reduced by in-
creasing the detuning ∆EW, the essential question is
“How faithfully is the initial velocity distribution repro-
duced in the narrow peak?”. To characterize this ef-
fect, we compare the width of the narrow peak to that
of the resolution function (atomic experimental veloc-
ity distribution before the bounce) for 36 runs acquired
at diﬀerent values of ∆EW. We now ﬁt the experimen-
tal curves by a sum of two Gaussians with all param-
eters adjustable except for the width and center of the
broad peak. Averaging over 36 measurements, we ﬁnd
σ2
(0.08vrec)2, where σres and
meas
±
σmeas are the half widths at 1/√e of the two curves after
the bounce, and the uncertainty is the standard devia-
tion of the weighted mean of our 36 measurements. A
negative sign in the result is not necessarily unphysical
because it could be due for example, to a slightly con-

(0.13vrec)2

σ2
res =

−

cave reﬂecting surface which collimates the atoms. We
do not consider this deviation from zero to be statistically
signiﬁcant, however. We conclude that the observed re-
ﬂection is consistent with a specular reﬂection to within
about 0.1 vrec. Our limit is a factor of 10 better than our
previous best result [1].

2

To compare our results with those of Refs. [2] and [4],
we calculate the rms angular deviation of an eﬀective re-
ﬂecting surface from perfectly plane: σθ = 1
vrms
vin , where
vin is the incident atomic velocity on the mirror and vrms
is the rms transverse velocity added by the mirror. Using
the upper limit vrms < 0.1 vrec, we ﬁnd that the eﬀective
mirror surface is ﬂat to within uncertainty of 0.5 mrad.
Thus, we conclude that at suﬃciently large detunings,
it is possible to produce a highly specular mirror for
atomic de Broglie waves. By analogy with photon optics,
the double structure we observe suggests that we are in

4

the regime where the roughness of the atomic mirror is
small compared to the wavelength of the reﬂected matter
wave. In that regime, the specular peak corresponds to a
“perfectly” coherent reﬂection, and it should be possible
to test this property in an atom interferometer. Interfer-
ometric experimental studies are in progress.

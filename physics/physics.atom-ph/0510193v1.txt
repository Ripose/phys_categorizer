(Dated: October 2005)

We propose a novel type of precision laser spectrometer for trapped, highly charged ions nearly
It consists of a cylindrical open-endcap Penning trap in which an externally produced
at rest.
bunch of highly charged ions can be conﬁned and investigated by means of laser spectroscopy. The
combination of conﬁnement, cooling and compression of a dense ion cloud will allow the ground
state hyperﬁne splitting in highly charged ions to be measured with an accuracy three orders of
magnitude better than in any previous experiment. A systematic study of diﬀerent charge states
and diﬀerent isotopes of the same element allows for highly sensitive tests of bound-state QED and
for a precision determination of nuclear properties. Apart from stable isotopes, also radioactive
species with half-lives longer than about one hour can be investigated.

INTRODUCTION

≈

The wavelength of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting
(HFS) in atoms and ions is typically in the microwave
domain and thus not accessible with lasers. However,
the energy of the 1s ground state HFS of hydrogen-like
ions scales with the atomic number Z as Z 3 and shifts
into the laser-accessible region above Z
60 [1]. At the
same time, the upper state lifetime scales as Z −9 and
eventually shifts into a region where acceptable ﬂuores-
cence rates from magnetic dipole (M1) transitions can be
expected. This allows for accurate measurements of the
transition by means of laser spectroscopy and in turn for
sensitive tests of corresponding calculations of the transi-
tion energy and lifetime [2, 3]. The 1s ground state HFS
in hydrogen-like ions has until now been observed experi-
mentally in only a few species: 165Ho66+ [4], 185,187Re74+
[5], 203,205Tl80+ [6], 207Pb81+ [7] and 209Bi82+ [8]. To our
knowledge, two measurements of the 2s ground state HFS
in lithium-like ions have been attempted. Both measure-
ments were performed on 209Bi80+ and the results are
inconclusive [9, 10].

The above measurements have been carried out at a
strorage ring [7, 8] and a common experimental obsta-
cle has been the eﬀect of the Doppler width and shift
of the transition due to the relativistic velocities of the
ions. The measurements performed in an EBIT (elec-
tron beam ion trap) [4, 5, 6] are not as severely subject
to this eﬀect, but suﬀer from a low signal-to-noise ratio.
The measurement scheme outlined here has the advan-
tage that it takes place in cryogenic surroundings with
well-localised particles nearly at rest. This reduces the
Doppler width and shift to a level of 10−7 of the mea-
sured transition, which is three orders of magnitude lower
than in any previous experiment. Furthermore, by use of
a ‘rotating wall’ [11], a high ion number density can be
obtained which, together with the localisation, increases
the intensity of the measured ﬂuorescence.

This instrument is to be used within the framework of

∗Electronic address: m.vogel@imperial.ac.uk

the HITRAP project [12] at the Gesellschaft f¨ur Schwe-
rionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. The highly charged
ions will be produced by the Experimental Storage Ring
(ESR), subsequently slowed and cooled, and ﬁnally made
available at low energies for experiments.

In section II we discuss the theoretical background to
this area before describing the proposed instrument and
measurement techniques in sections III and IV.

II. HYPERFINE SPLITTING CALCULATIONS

HFS calculations have been performed for a number of
hydrogen-like ions [1, 2, 3]; the most accurate ones are
given for the isotopes listed above. As a ﬁrst approxima-
tion, good within 4 %, the HFS of the (1s) 2S1/2 ground
state of hydrogen-like ions is given by [1]:

where α is the ﬁne structure constant, gI = µ/(µN I) is
the nuclear g-factor (with µ the nuclear magnetic mo-
ment and µN the nuclear magneton), I the nuclear an-
gular momentum, me and mp are the electron and proton
mass respectively, and c is the speed of light. Equation
(1) represents the normal ground state HFS multiplied
by a correction A1s for the relativistic energy of the 1s
electron, where κ is related to the angular momentum j
of the electron. To account for the charge distribution
of the nucleus, a ﬁrst order approximation is made by
assuming that the charge is evenly distributed over the
volume of the spherical nucleus. This ﬁnite-size correc-
tion is given by the factor (1
δ1s) in equation (1). The
values for δ1s have been taken from [2], those for gI and
I were taken from [13]. The values for 207Pb81+ for ex-
ample, are δ1s = 0.1059, gI = +0.59258 and I = 1/2.
The corresponding M1 transition is between the (lower)
F = 0 and (upper) F = 1 hyperﬁne states.

hyperﬁne level of the ground state for diﬀerent hydrogen-like
(full symbols) and lithium-like ions (open symbols).

Figure 1 shows the corresponding transition wave-
lengths between the upper and lower hyperﬁne level of
the ground state for diﬀerent hydrogen-like and lithium-
like ions. Only isotopes with a lifetime longer than one
hour are depicted. The wavelength region is restricted to
the range accessible with readily available laser systems.
The ﬁgure illustrates that a large number of isotopes can
be studied.

The main uncertainty in the HFS calculations is caused
by the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect [1, 14], which is due to the
ﬁnite spatial distribution of the nuclear magnetisation.
This limitation can be circumvented by a comparison
of the ground state HFS in a hydrogen-like ion and its
lithium-like counterpart which to ﬁrst order rules out all
nuclear eﬀects and allows for bound-state QED eﬀects to
be isolated [15].

Correspondingly, a measurement of the HFS transition
in a series of isotopes of the same hydrogen-like species
rules out the eﬀects of charge and isolates nuclear prop-
erties which can be probed with the single electron.

When the results from equation (1) are compared with
experimental values [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the diﬀerence (
4%)
is found to increase with Z and equation (1) generally
underestimates the experimental values. This is mostly
attributed to the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect and to QED con-
tributions (vacuum polarisation and self-energy) [1]. For
example, in the case of 207Pb81+ the measured wave-
length is 1019.7(2) nm [7], while a full calculation includ-
ing all the above corrections gives 1020(4) nm [1].

5 hyperﬁne states.

The results of these calculations are shown in ﬁgure
1 as open symbols. The corrections to the values from
equation (3) are estimated to be about 4% in this case
as well. From x-ray measurements in 209Bi80+ a tenta-
tive HFS transition wavelength of 1512 nm was derived
by subtraction of two measured x-ray transitions yield-
ing the wavelength of the HFS-transition [9]. Calcula-
tions following this experiment predicted 1582 nm [16],
1564 nm [17] and 1554 nm [18]. A second direct mea-
surement aimed for the latter value, but no resonance
within the predicted limits was found [10]. A deﬁnitive
measurement is therefore very desirable.

III. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND
TECHNIQUES

A. Setup and procedure

For these experiments a cylindrical open endcap Pen-
ning trap [20], with an additional capture electrode at
both ends, has been chosen. The ring electrode is axi-
ally split into four segments to allow for the rotating wall
technique [11, 21] to be used.

The trap is to be enclosed in a vacuum container at
liquid helium temperature, which ensures eﬃcient cry-
opumping. The estimated residual gas pressure inside
the trap is below 10−12 Pa. This value is estimated from
measured trapping times of highly-charged ions in a simi-
lar trap. Trapping is ensured by an electrostatic trapping
potential across the trap and a static homogeneous axial
magnetic ﬁeld. As will be discussed below, it appears
feasible to work with a magnetic ﬂux density below 1 T.
For such a Penning trap experiment, typically a super-
conducting magnet would be used. However, ﬁelds as
low as 1 T could also be produced by permanent mag-
nets, which are advantageous in terms of size and cost.

Figure 2 shows a schematic of the trap structure. Further
details are given in [19].

In the proposed experiment, an externally produced
bunch of roughly 105 ions at an energy of a few eV is
loaded into the trap along the axis, i.e. along the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines.
It is captured in ﬂight [22], conﬁned,
resistively cooled and then radially compressed by the
rotating wall technique. If necessary, several bunches of
ions can be accumulated in the trap [23]. The spec-
troscopy laser driving the hyperﬁne transition is run
in a continuous-wave mode and enters the trap axially
through an open-endcap. The laser beam is shaped such
that it illuminates the full radial cross section of the ion
cloud. The ﬂuorescence is detected perpendicular to the
cooled axial motion (trap axis).

B. Resistive cooling

The axial motion is resistively cooled by a resonant
circuit attached to the endcaps. The ion motion induces
image charges in the endcaps and causes an oscillating
current to ﬂow through the resonant circuit, which is
tuned to the axial trapping frequency and eﬀectively dis-
sipates the ions’ kinetic energy. The resistance of the
circuit thus leads to a damping of the ion motion ampli-
tude. The induced current is proportional to the ion ve-
locity and therefore the dissipated power is proportional
to the kinetic energy. For a single particle there is an
exponential energy decrease, which is given by [24]

E(t) = E0exp(

t/τ ) and τ =

(5)

−

m(2z0)2
Rq2

.

Here, q is the particle charge, m its mass and 2z0 is the
eﬀective distance between the endcaps [20]. In resonance,
the impedance of an LC-circuit is real and acts as an
ohmic resistor with resistance R = QLωz, where Q is the
quality factor of the circuit and L the inductance. The
axial frequency ωz is given by

ωz =

qU0
mz2

(6)

(7)

where U0 is the trapping potential. For cryogenic LC-
circuits typical values are Q
1 mH, and
C < 100 pF, so that at axial frequencies around 1 MHz
the resonance resistance is of the order of 1 MΩ. The cor-
responding bandwidth of the ﬁlter, deﬁned as ∆ω = ω/Q,
is about 2 kHz. The resistive cooling time constant, ex-
pressed in terms of the ﬁlter components, is given by

Deviations from the exponential cooling behaviour may
occur when the dissipated power is not proportional to
the kinetic energy of the ions. For example, if the axial
frequency ωz depends on the ions’ kinetic energy, ωz may

move out of resonance with the LC-circuit. For large am-
plitudes the motion is no longer harmonic since higher or-
der multipole components in the trapping potential may
become signiﬁcant [25, 26]. The quality factor Q of the
resonant circuit thus needs to be chosen such that both
cooling time and bandwidth are optimal.

In a cloud of ions, only the common centre-of-mass-
mode (c.m.-mode) is cooled resistively with high eﬃ-
ciency [27]. This is easily understood for the so-called
‘breathing mode’, where the centre of the charges is sta-
tionary and therefore (to ﬁrst order) no current is in-
duced. However, through intra-cloud interactions, such
as ion-ion collisions, energy transfer between the ions
occurs thus creating motional ﬂuctuations which induce
currents leading to energy dissipation from the motion.
The ﬁnal temperature is determined by electronic noise
present in the resonant circuit, which eﬀectively heats the
ion cloud [28]. The electronic noise temperature can sig-
niﬁcantly exceed the ambient temperature [28, 29], and
we therefore assume an axial ion temperature of 10 K,
instead of 4.2 K.

The c.m.-motion of an ion cloud obeys the single parti-
cle equation (5). To ﬁrst order τ does not depend on the
number of ions under the condition that the distribution
of axial frequencies is smaller than the bandwidth of the
resonant circuit [25].

Figure 3 shows the dependence of τ on ωz for 207Pb81+-
ions cooled by a resonant circuit (Q=500, L=1 mH) at-
tached to the trap (z0=15 mm, U0=1000 V). The ﬁgure
assumes that the resonant circuit is always tuned to the
axial frequency. A lowering of ωz, for example due to
space charge eﬀects (section III D 3), results in an in-
crease of τ .

Figure 4 shows experimental data on the cooling of a
cloud of about 30 12C5+-ions with an initial mean kinetic
energy of about 13 eV in a potential well of 50 eV (taken
from [30]). Due to the high energy, trapping potential
anharmonicities shift the axial frequency downwards by
about 5% so that only the coldest fraction of the ions
in this ensemble is in resonance with the cooling circuit.

For the cloud of 30 C5+ ions, whose cooling behaviour
is shown in ﬁgure 4, the estimated Debye length is com-
parable to the mean particle spacing of a few tens of mi-
crometres. The estimated coupling parameter is about 5
and the ion cloud behaves like a ﬂuid.

For a plasma formed of highly-charged ions,

like
207Pb81+ at cryogenic temperatures and with a density of
some 106 cm−3, the Debye length is several micrometres,
which is much smaller than typical cloud dimensions of
millimetres. At the same time, Γ-values of 300 can easily
be reached.

The cloud rotation is driven by the electric ﬁeld pro-
duced by a rotating dipole. To this end, sinusoidal AC-
voltages with a ﬁxed phase shift are applied to the dif-
ferent ring segments of the trap [11]. The rotating wall
technique was ﬁrst applied to increase the cloud density
of a laser cooled ion cloud in order to observe crystallisa-
tion [11, 21]. The resulting cloud compression is due to
the Lorentz force directed towards the trap centre. The
ﬁnal density results from a balance between the Lorentz
force and the Coulomb force between the ions.

It can be shown [32] that the ion number density of
a single-component plasma, such as a cloud of highly
charged ions, is given by

where ω is the applied rotating wall frequency. The

FIG. 4: Resistive cooling behaviour of a cloud of 30 C5+-ions,
taken from [30].

Within the Boltzmann distribution of ion energies, this
is the largest fraction and it results in the initial fast
decrease of the total noise power in ﬁgure 4. The cool-
ing time constant (around 132 ms) is equal to the one
measured for an ion cloud with low kinetic energy in a
harmonic trap. On longer timescales, the dominant cool-
ing process is the energy dissipation from the non-c.m.-
modes. This has a measured value of τ = 5 s, which is
more than one order of magnitude longer than for the
c.m.-mode. For the planned experiments, we expect τ -
values of several tens of seconds.

C. Rotating wall

When an ion plasma conﬁned in a Penning trap is cou-
pled such that the dynamics cannot be described by a
single particle approach, the ion number density n (see
eq. 10) and related properties of the cloud are governed
by its global rotation frequency ω. This is the case if the
Debye length

is much smaller than any of the cloud dimensions. The
density drops from its homogeneous value to zero over a
distance λD, but as this distance is much smaller than
the cloud dimensions, it can be treated as a hard edge.
The plasma acts as a solid when the coupling parameter

Rotating wall frequencies below the actual cloud rotation

Although n is solely determined by ω, the shape of
the ion cloud depends on both ω and U0 and is generally
a spheroid. Once the aspect ratio β (length divided by

(16)

(17)

diameter) is determined, the dimensions of the ion cloud
can be calculated, provided that the density n and the
number of particles N are known. The aspect ratio is
implicitly related to ωz, and therefore to U0, by a transfer
function b(β) deﬁned by [34]

This means that b(β) = 3 when ω equals ωm or ω′
c,
irrespective of the particle and trapping parameters. At
these frequency limits β vanishes, i.e. the cloud looks like
an iniﬁnitely large and thin disc (oblate). For any other
frequency b(β) < 3, so that β > 0. (Note: equations (15)
cannot be analytically solved for β.)

Therefore, the cyclotron and rotating wall frequencies
determine the ion number density of the cloud, the num-
ber of ions changes the cloud dimensions, and the trap-
ping potential determines the aspect ratio. The lower U0,
the more elongated (prolate) the cloud is. For ﬁxed U0
and B, both shape and dimensions are fully determined
by ω. For the present experiment, these parameters are
chosen to produce a nearly spherical ion cloud, this is the
case for example for B=0.8 T, U0=1000 V and ω = ωc/2
when about 105 ions are conﬁned in the trap.

D. Related eﬀects

1. Exerted torque

When the rotating wall frequency ω diﬀers from the
actual rotation frequency of the ion cloud, the torque
exerted is not maximal and ‘slip’ occurs. This leads to
a cloud rotation frequency lower than ω, even if no in-
ternal degrees of freedom of the plasma are heated (see

FIG. 5: (2,1)-plasma mode frequency (k = 1) versus aspect
ratio β. For β ≈ 1 there is no (2,1) plasma mode frequency
between ωm (minimum) and ωc/2 (maximum).

below). Therefore, ω is ramped up from ωm to the de-
sired rotation frequency. By this method densities are
increased in a controllable manner, as has been shown in
[35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. The ideal ramping speed is a com-
promise between slip and undesired excitation of plasma
modes. The exerted torque ξ has been empirically found
to follow qualitatively the following relationship [25]:

2. Excitation of plasma modes

Usually it is found that at a certain driving frequency
the ion cloud density stabilises and then drops to zero
for higher frequencies. This has been found to occur
due to plasma resonances. The (2,1) plasma mode was
the limiting factor to the density in the experiments by
Bollinger et al [40]. The (2,1) mode is a precession mo-
tion of the plasma’s main axis about the magnetic ﬁeld
lines, as is depicted for example in [31, 40]. If the ap-
plied frequency matches such a plasma resonance, energy
is transferred from the external ﬁeld into deformation
motions of the plasma rather than into global rotation
[34, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Due to this energy transfer the cloud
heats up and eventually ions will be lost [44, 45, 46].

The mode spectrum depends on the applied trapping
potentials and by appropriate sudden switching, a plasma
mode may jump over the applied frequency [40]. To be
able to make use of this, the plasma mode frequencies
need to be known to suﬃcient accuracy. For the (2,1)
plasma mode the three mode frequencies ω1, ω2 and ω3
result from the three solutions η1, η2 and η3 of the cubic
equation a3η3 + a2η2 + a1η + a0 = 0 [40]:

3. Space charge eﬀects

Due to the high density of highly charged ions in the
trap, space charge eﬀects occur, i.e. the positive poten-
tial due to the ions eﬀectively reduces the quadrupole
potential. To compensate for this eﬀect, the trapping
potential U0 needs to be increased. The most prominent
space charge eﬀect is a large downward shift of the axial
frequency ωz, as depicted in ﬁgure 3. Image charges in-
duced in the trap electrodes also lead to frequency shifts
but these are negligible compared to the space charge
shifts.

When the density of the spherical (β

is nearly homogeneous, the shifted axial frequency for a
ﬁxed trapping potential is [25]

IV. LASER SPECTROSCOPY

The space charge eﬀects thus lower ωz, increase the resis-
tive cooling time constant τ , and lower the plasma den-
sity n. Figure 6 shows the space charge eﬀects on the ion
number density, the cloud dimension and the trapping
potential as a function of the rotating wall frequency ω.
Parameters used are as before, T =10 K, B=0.8 T, N =105
207Pb81+ ions, z0=15 mm. Note that the space charge
eﬀects reduce the eﬀective trapping potential by almost
one order of magnitude.

Figure 7 shows the calculated cloud diameter for a
spherical cloud (β
1) and the maximum achievable
ion number density n as a function of the magnetic ﬂux
density B, including space charge eﬀects. While the ion
number density increases strongly with increasing mag-
netic ﬂux density, even low magnetic ﬁelds already lead
to acceptable cloud sizes. The cloud density is important
for the ﬂuorescence rate, as will be discussed in the next
section.

A possible pitfall in the laser spectroscopy experiment
proposed here is the danger of optical pumping into un-
desired states. When the level scheme is such that the
population may be pumped to hyperﬁne substates (MF )
that cannot be excited by the pumping laser, these ions
remain in the trap but no longer contribute to the ﬂu-
orescence. However, as long as the degeneracy of the
upper hyperﬁne level exceeds that of the lower one, and
circularly polarised light is used, optical pumping is not
a problem. This is the case if gI is positive, which is true
for example for 207Pb81+ [7] and 209Bi80+ [9].

The transition probability for a magnetic dipole (M1)
transition from the excited to the lower hyperﬁne state
is given by [1]:

A =

4αω3~2I (2κ + 1)

7

We present a novel precision laser spectrometer for
measurements on cold, trapped highly charged ions. An
externally produced bunch of highly charged ions from a
storage ring is captured in ﬂight, conﬁned in a cylindri-
cal open-endcap Penning trap, resistively cooled to cryo-
genic temperatures and radially compressed by a rotating
wall. Subsequently, it is irradiated by a laser and ﬂuo-
rescence light is detected perpendicular to the trap axis.
A measurement of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting in
a highly charged ion represents a sensitive test of corre-
sponding calculations, which include the Bohr-Weisskopf
eﬀect and QED eﬀects. By a comparison of the ground
state HFS in diﬀerent charge states of the same isotope
all nuclear eﬀects can be ruled out to ﬁrst order, which
allows for bound-state QED eﬀects to be isolated. Suit-
able species are for example 207Pb81+, 209Bi82+, 209Bi80+
and 235U91+. With a suﬃciently dense and well-localised
cloud of ions, a laser spectroscopy experiment with a rel-
ative accuracy of a few parts in 107 is feasible. This ac-
curacy exceeds that of previous measurements by three
orders of magnitude. Essential prerequisites are suﬃcient
cooling of the ion motion by resistive cooling, and ion
cloud compression by use of a rotating wall technique.
Space charge eﬀects have been included in the calcula-
tions to account for the inﬂuences of the high charge
density within the ion cloud. The presented methods
are applicable also to radioactive species with half-lives
longer than the typical measurement time of the order of
1 h.

(1). The lifetime of the excited state is t = A−1, and the
natural linewidth of the transition is ∆ν = (2πt)−1. The
relative Doppler-broadened linewidth of the transition is
given by [47]

with wavelength λ is given by [47]:

For most species shown in ﬁgure 1, saturation intensities
less than 1000 Wm−2 are required, which are readily ob-
tained in the relevant wavelength region by use of com-
mon laser systems. The values for 207Pb81+, 209Bi80+
and 235U91+ are 153 Wm−2, 71 Wm−2 and 28 Wm−2, re-
spectively. The radial cross section of the ion cloud is
of the order of 10 mm2, which implies that a maximum
laser power of only a few mW is suﬃcient.

The relative Doppler-broadened linewidth ∆νD/ν of
the transition slowly decreases almost linearly with
atomic number Z for hydrogen-like and lithium-like
ions. For hydrogen-like lead 207Pb81+, ∆νD/ν is about
10−7, which corresponds to a Doppler broadening of
1.6
50 MHz at 10 K, while ∆ν = 3 Hz. The anticipated accu-
racy of a measurement on cold, trapped ions is therefore
of the order of 10−7, which is three orders of magnitude
better than any previous measurement [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

×

For an upper state lifetime of about 50 ms in the case
of 207Pb81+, and for a detection eﬃciency of the order
of some 10−3, the expected ﬂuorescence rate from a fully
saturated cloud of 105 ions is a few thousand counts per
second. As compared to expected background rates be-
low 100 s−1, this yields a suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio
of about 50.

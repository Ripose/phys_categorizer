Abstract

Accurate calculations of the binding energies, the hyperﬁne split-
ting, the bound-electron g-factor, and the parity nonconservation ef-
fects in heavy few-electron ions are considered. The calculations in-
clude the relativistic, quantum electrodynamic (QED), electron-correlation,
and nuclear eﬀects. The theoretical results are compared with avail-
able experimental data. A special attention is focused on tests of QED
in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Accurate calculations of heavy few-electron ions must be performed in the
framework of the rigorous quantum electrodynamic (QED) formalism. The
basic methods of quantum electrodynamics were formulated to the beginning
of 1930’s, almost immediately after creation of quantum mechanics. This
theory provided description of such low-order processes as emission and ab-
sorption of photons and creation and annihilation of electron-positron pairs.
However, application of this theory to some higher-order eﬀects gave inﬁnite
results. This problem remained unsolved until the late 1940’s when Lamb
and Retherford discovered the 2s − 2p1/2 splitting (Lamb shift) in hydrogen.
This discovery stimulated theorists to complete the creation of QED since it
was believed that this splitting is of quantum electrodynamic origin. First
evaluation of the Lamb shift was performed by Bethe who used Kramer’s

1

idea of the mass renormalization. A consequent QED formalism was devel-
oped by Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga. They showed that all
inﬁnities can be removed from the theory by so-called renormalization pro-
cedure. The basic idea of this procedure is the following. The electron mass
and the electron charge, which originally occur in the theory, are not directly
measurable quantities. All physical quantities calculated within QED be-
come ﬁnite if they are expressed in terms of the physical electron mass and
charge, parameters which can directly be measured in experiment. All cal-
culations in QED are based on the perturbation theory in the ﬁne structure
constant α ≈ 1/137.036. The individual terms of the perturbation series are
conveniently represented by so-called Feynman diagrams.

Before the beginning of 1970’s investigations of QED eﬀects in atomic
systems were mainly restricted to low-Z atoms such as hydrogen or helium
(here and below, Z is the nuclear charge number).
In these systems, in
addition to the small parameter α, there is another small parameter, which
is αZ. For this reason, all calculations of low-Z atoms were based on the
expansion in α and αZ.

A great progress in experimental investigations of heavy few-electron ions,
which was made for the last decades (see [1, 2] and references therein), has re-
quired accurate QED calculations for these systems. Investigations of heavy
few-electron ions play a special role in tests of quantum electrodynamics.
This is due to two reasons. First, in contrast to low-Z atoms, the parameter
αZ is not small and, therefore, the calculations must be performed without
any expansion in αZ [3]. Second, in contrast to heavy neutral atoms, the
electron-correlation eﬀects can be calculated to a high accuracy using the
pertubation theory in the parameter 1/Z. For this reason, the QED eﬀects
are not masked by large electron-correlation eﬀects, as it takes place in neu-
tral atoms. This provides an excellent opportunity to test QED at strong
electric ﬁelds.

The calculations of high-Z few-electron ions are generally based on per-
turbation theory. To zeroth order, one can consider that electrons interact
only with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus. The interelectronic-interaction
and QED eﬀects are accounted for by perturbation theory in the parame-
ters 1/Z and α, respectively. This leads to quantum electrodynamics in the
Furry picture. To formulate the perturbation theory for calculations of the
energy levels, transition and scattering amplitudes, it is convenient to use
the two-time Green function method [4]. For very heavy ions the parameter

2

1/Z becomes comparable with α and, therefore, all the corrections may be
classiﬁed by the parameter α only.
In the present paper, we consider the
current status of these calculations.

Relativistic units (¯h = c = 1) are used in the paper.

2 Binding energies in heavy few-electron ions

2.1 H-like ions

To calculate the binding energy in a hydrogenlike ion, we may start with the
Dirac equation,

(α · p + βm + VC(r))ψ(r) = Eψ(r) ,

(1)

where VC(r) is the Coulomb potential induced by the nucleus. For the point-
nucleus case, this equation leads to the binding energy

(j + 1/2)2 − (αZ)2 − (j + 1/2), n is the principal quantum
where ν = n +
number, and j is the total angular momentum. To get the binding energy
to a higher accuracy, we have to evaluate the quantum electrodynamic and
nuclear corrections.

The ﬁnite-nuclear-size correction can be obtained by solving the Dirac
equation with the potential induced by an extended-charge nucleus and tak-
ing the diﬀerence between the energies for the extended and the point nu-
cleus model. This can be done either numerically (see, e.g., Ref.
[5]) or
analytically [6]. To a relative accuracy of ∼ 0.2%, in the range Z=1-100 the
ﬁnite-nuclear-size correction is given by the following approximate formulas

The corresponding formulas for other states can be found in Ref.
[6]. We
note that, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case where the corresponding
correction is completely deﬁned by the root-mean-square radius, in heavy ions
the higher-order moments of the nuclear charge distribution are required to
determine the nuclear-size correction on a 1% accuracy level. For instance,
in case of Z=92 to gain the precision ∼ 0.2% it is necessary to know the
moment hr4i.

The next corrections one should take into account are the QED correc-
tions of ﬁrst order in α. They are determined by the self-energy (SE) and
vacuum-polarization (VP) diagrams (Fig. 1a,b). The contribution of the
self-energy diagram (Fig. 1a) combined with the corresponding mass coun-
terterm is given by

the photon propagator, αµ = (1, α), and α is a vector incorporating the Dirac
matrices. The ﬁrst evaluation of the SE correction for heavy ions was per-
formed by Desiderio and Johnson [7] who employed the method suggested by
Brown, Langer, and Schaefer [8]. Later, Mohr [9] developed another method
which allowed him to perform a high precision evaluation of this correction
in the range Z = 10 − 110. An alternative approach to this problem was
[10, 11, 12]. The most accurate calculations of the SE
worked out in Refs.

correction to all orders in αZ were performed by Mohr [13] and by Indelicato
and Mohr [14] for the point nucleus case and by Mohr and Soﬀ [15] for the
case of extended nuclei. The highest accuracy for low-Z ions was achieved
by Jentschura et al. [16].

This expression is ultraviolet divergent. It can be renormalized by dividing
into two parts. The ﬁrst part corresponds to the ﬁrst nonzero term in the
potential expansion of the Coulomb Green function in powers of αZ. This
part, so-called Uehling part, becomes ﬁnite due to the charge renormalization
and its evaluation causes no problem. The second part, so-called Wichmann-
Kroll (WK) part, accounts for all higher-order terms of the αZ-expansion.
Despite this part is ﬁnite, the regularization is still needed due to a spurious
gauge-dependent piece of the light-by-light scattering contribution. Calcula-
tions of the WK contribution in a wide range of Z were performed ﬁrst by
Soﬀ and Mohr [17] for the extended nucleus case and by Manakov et al. [18]
for the point nucleus case. The most accurate results for some speciﬁc ions
were obtained by Persson et al. [19].

The QED corrections of second order in α are determined by diagrams
presented in Fig. 2. Most of these diagrams can be calculated using the
methods developed for the ﬁrst-order SE and VP corrections [20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26]. The most demanding problem is to evaluate the SE-SE diagrams
[27] and the V(SE)P diagram (the diagram with a photon line inside the
VP loop) [28]. The loop-after-loop SE-SE diagram was ﬁrst evaluated by
Mitrushenkov et al. [29]. A partial evaluation of the other SE-SE diagrams
was performed by Mallampalli and Sapirstein [30]. The residual SE-SE terms
were ﬁrst calculated by Yerokhin and Shabaev [31]. Finally, in Refs. [32] the
whole gauge invariant set of the SE-SE diagrams was evaluated in the range
Z = 10 − 100. As to the S(VP)E diagram, to date it was evaluated only in
the Uehling approximation [20, 21].

The calculations discussed above are based on the approximation in which
the nucleus is considered as a source of the external Coulomb ﬁeld. It deﬁnes
quantum electrodynamics within the external ﬁeld approximation. The ﬁrst
step beyond this approximation would consist in evaluation of the nuclear

5

recoil correction. As is known, in the nonrelativisic theory of a hydrogenlike
atom the recoil eﬀect can easily be taken into account by using the electron
reduced mass µ = mM/(m + M). A rigorous relativistic theory of the re-
coil eﬀect can be formulated only in the framework of QED. In case of a
hydrogenlike atom, a close formula for the recoil eﬀect to ﬁrst order in m/M
and to all orders in αZ was derived in Ref. [33] (see also [34] and references
therein). According to this formula, the recoil correction is given by the sum
of a low-order term ∆EL and a higher order term ∆EH, where

Here p is the momentum operator, G(ω) is the Coulomb Green function,
Dm(ω) = −4παZαlDlm(ω) , and Dik(ω, r) is the transverse part of the pho-
ton propagator in the Coulomb gauge. In equation (9), the scalar product
is implicit. The term ∆EL contains all the recoil corrections within the
(αZ)4m2/M approximation. For the point nucleus case, it can easily be
calculated analytically [33]

∆EL =

m2 − E2

The term ∆EH contains the contribution of order (αZ)5m2/M and all con-
tributions of higher order in αZ which are not accounted for by the ∆EL
term. Numerical evaluations of the recoil correction to all orders in αZ were
performed in Refs. [35, 36] for point and extended nuclei, respectively.

.

Finally, one should take into account the nuclear polarization correction,
which sets the ultimate limit of accuracy up to which QED can be tested in
atomic systems. This correction is determined by the electron-nucleus inter-
action diagrams in which the intermediate states of the nucleus are excited.
It was evaluated by Plunien and Soﬀ [37] and by Neﬁodov et al. [38].

The individual contributions to the ground-state binding energy in 238U91+
are given in Table 1. The uncertainty of the Dirac binding energy comes
from the uncertainty of the R∞hc constant [39]. The ﬁnite-nuclear-size cor-
rection is evaluated for the Fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution

6

with hr2i1/2 = 5.8507(72) fm [40]. The uncertainty of this correction is esti-
mated by adding quadratically two errors, one obtained by varying the root-
mean-square radius and the other obtained by changing the model of the
nuclear-charge distribution from the Fermi to the homogeneously-charged-
sphere model. As one can see from the table, the present status of the theory
and experiment on heavy H-like ions provides a test of QED on the level of
about 2%.

2.2 Li-like ions

To date, the highest accuracy was achieved in experiments on the 2p1/2,3/2−2s
transitions in heavy Li-like ions [42, 43, 44, 45]. In these systems, in addi-
tion to the one-electron contributions discussed above, one has to evaluate
two- and three-electron contributions. To ﬁrst order in α, the two-electron
contribution is determined by the one-photon exchange diagram (Fig. 3)
whose calculation causes no problem. To second order in α, one should ac-
count for the two-photon exchange diagrams (Fig. 4) and the self-energy
and vacuum-polarization screening diagrams (Fig. 5). The two-photon ex-
change diagrams were evaluated by diﬀerent authors [46, 47, 48, 49, 50].
The results of these calculations are in a good agreement with each other.
The complete calculation of the vacuum-polarization screening diagrams was
[51]. The self-energy screening diagrams were evaluated
performed in Ref.
in Refs.
in
addition to higher-order one-electron QED corrections, one should evaluate
the interelectronic-interaction corrections of third and higher orders in the
parameter 1/Z. Such evaluations within the framework of the Breit approx-
imation were accomplished in Refs. [53, 54, 48].

[52, 47]. To gain an accuracy required by the experiments,

The individual contributions to the 2p1/2 − 2s transition energy in Li-
like uranium are presented in Table 2. The total theoretical value of the
transition energy, 280.66(22) eV, agrees well with the related experimental
values, 280.59(10) eV [42] and 280.52(10) eV [45]. Comparing the ﬁrst- and
second-order QED contributions, −42.93 eV and 1.45(18) eV, respectively,
with the total theoretical and experimental uncertainties, we conclude that
the present status of the theory for Li-like uranium provides a test of QED
on a 0.5% level to ﬁrst order in α and on a 15% level to second order in α.

2.3 He-like ions

In Refs.
[55, 56] the two-electron contribution to the ground state energy
of heliumlike ions was measured. It was done by comparing the ionization
energies of heliumlike and hydrogenlike ions. This experiment is of special
importance since to date the two-electron contribution is the only measured
value which has been calculated to the second order in α. As in case of
Li-like ions, the lowest-order two-electron contribution is determined by the
one-photon exchange diagram. The contributions of second order in α are
given by the two-photon exchange diagrams and by the SE and VP screen-
ing diagrams. The two-photon exchange contribution was ﬁrst evaluated by
Blundell et al.
[58]. This contribution can be
conventionally divided into two parts: one which corresponds to the Breit
approximation and the other which is beyond the Breit approximation. The
VP and SE screening diagrams for the ground state were evaluated in Refs.
[59, 60, 61, 62]. The corresponding calculations for excited states of He-like
ions were performed in Refs. [63, 64, 65, 48, 49, 66, 67].

[57] and by Lindgren et al.

In Table 3 we present the individual contributions to the two-electron
binding energy of the ground state in He-like uranium. The two-photon
exchange contribution is divided into two parts as described above. The
Breit contribution and the higher-order QED corrections are evaluated as in
Ref. [67]. As one can see from the table, to test the screened QED eﬀects,
the experimental precision should be improved by an order of magnitude.

3 Hyperﬁne splitting in heavy ions

High-precision measurements of the hyperﬁne splitting (HFS) in heavy hy-
drogenlike ions [68, 69, 70, 71, 72] have triggered a great interest to theo-
retical calculations of this eﬀect. The ground-state hyperﬁne splitting of a
hydrogenlike ion is conveniently written as [73]

δ is the nuclear charge distribution correction, ε is the nuclear magnetization
distribution correction (so-called Bohr-Weisskopf correction), and xrad is the
QED correction. The most accurate calculations of the QED corrections were
performed in Refs. [74, 75, 76]. The uncertainty of the theoretical predictions
is mainly determined by the uncertainty of the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) eﬀect.
In calculations, based on the single-particle nuclear model [73, 77, 74, 78],
which provide a reasonable agreement with the experiments (see, e.g., Ref.
[4]), this uncertainty may amount up to about 100% of the BW eﬀect and
is generally larger than the total QED contribution. More elaborated cal-
culations, based on many-particle nuclear models [79, 80], do not provide a
desirable agreement with the experiments.

A new method to determine the BW eﬀect was recently developed in Ref.
[81]. In this method the BW correction to the hyperﬁne splitting in hydro-
genlike 209Bi, 203Tl, and 205Tl was determined using experimental data on
the hyperﬁne splitting in the corresponding muonic atoms [82, 83]. The pa-
rameters of the nuclear magnetization distribution were chosen to reproduce
the experimental values of the nuclear magnetic moment as well as the BW
eﬀect in muonic atoms extracted from the corresponding experiments. The
single-particle and conﬁguration-mixing nuclear models were considered. To
increase the precision of determining the BW contribution, the QED correc-
tions for muonic atoms have been evaluated.
In Table 4, the BW correc-
tion to the HFS in electronic H-like ions, derived from the experiments on
muonic atoms, is compared with the BW correction obtained by direct cal-
culations within the single- and many-particle nuclear models. Taking into
account that the uncertainty of the single-particle results may amount up to
30-100%, we conclude that the ε values, based on experiments with muonic
atoms, have a better accuracy.

In Table 5, we compare the total theoretical results for the HFS in H-like
ions with experiment. As one can see from the table, the results based on ex-
periments with muonic atoms are closer to the experimental ones, compared
to the results based on the direct calculations within the single-particle nu-
clear model. However, due to a higher accuracy of the former results, a small
discrepancy between the theory and experiment occurs for 209Bi82+. It can

9

also be seen that in case of two isotopes of Tl the results of Ref. [81] are much
closer to the related experimental values than in case of Bi. Since, in contrast
to the Tl isotopes, the bismuth nucleus has a nonzero electric-quadrupole
moment, one may expect that the discrepancy between the theory and ex-
periment is caused by a large contribution of the electric-quadrupole splitting
in muonic bismuth. It is known that the ﬁrst-order electric-quadrupole split-
ting vanishes for s states. However, the second-order eﬀect is nonzero and,
in principle, it may be signiﬁcant for muonic atoms. This is due to a rela-
tively large role of the electric-quadrupole HFS interaction in muonic atoms
compared to electronic ones. Our numerical evaluation of this eﬀect showed
that, whereas it changes the HFS in muonic bismuth by about −3.4 eV, it
almost does not aﬀect the BW value presented in Table 4.

One of the main goals of the HFS experiments with heavy H-like ions was
to probe the magnetic sector of QED in the presence of a strong Coulomb
ﬁeld. The analysis of the theoretical results showed, however, that the QED
corrections to the HFS in heavy H-like ions are strongly masked by the un-
certainty of the BW eﬀect. This makes unfeasible tests of QED by a direct
comparison of theory and experiment on the HFS in heavy H-like ions. An
opportunity for QED tests has been found by considering a speciﬁc diﬀerence
of the ground-state HFS values in H- and Li-like ions [84]. Namely, it was
shown that the diﬀerence

∆′E = ∆E(2s) − ξ∆E(1s) ,

(13)

where ∆E(1s) and ∆E(2s) are the HFS in H- and Li-like ions of the same
isotope, is very stable with respect to variations of the nuclear model, if
the parameter ξ is chosen to cancel the BW corrections in the right-hand
side of equation (13). The parameter ξ is almost independent of the nuclear
structure and, therefore, can be calculated to a high accuracy.
In case of
Bi, the calculations yield ξ = 0.16885 and ∆′E= −61.27(4). The non-QED
It
and QED contributions amount to -61.52(4) and 0.24(1), respectively.
means that the QED contribution is six times larger than the current total
theoretical uncertainty. This provides good perspectives for tests of QED in
the HFS experiments. In particular, it can be shown that this method allows
one to test QED on level of a few percent, provided the HFS is measured to
accuracy ∼ 10−6.

4 Bound-electron g-factor

The g-factor of a hydrogenlike ion with a spinless nucleus can be deﬁned as

g(e) = −

z |JMJ i

hJMJ |µ(e)
µBMJ

,

where µ(e) is the operator of the magnetic moment of electron and µB is the
Bohr magneton. For the 1s state, a simple relativistic calculation based on
the Dirac equation yields

gD = 2 − (4/3)(1 −

1 − (αZ)2) .

q

The total g-factor value can be written as

g(e) = gD + ∆gQED + ∆grec + ∆gNS ,

where ∆gQED is the QED correction, ∆grec is the nuclear recoil correction,
and ∆gNS is the ﬁnite-nuclear-size correction. High-precision measurements
of the bound-electron g-factor in H-like carbon [85, 86] and oxygen [87] have
stimulated successful theoretical calculations of this eﬀect (see Refs.
[88,
89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94] and references therein). In particular, these studies
provided a new determination of the electron mass to an accuracy which
is four times better than that of the 1998 CODATA value. As a result,
the 2002 CODATA value for the electron mass [39] is derived from the g
factor measurements. An extension of these experiments to higher-Z systems,
which is anticipated in the near future, could lead also to an independent
determination of the ﬁne structure constant.

For heavy H-like ions the theoretical uncertainty of the bound-electron
g-factor is mainly determined by the nuclear eﬀects [91, 93]. This uncertainty
becomes comparable with the binding QED corrections of second order in α
and, therefore, strongly restricts probing QED in these investigations. How-
ever, in Ref.
[95] it was shown that the uncertainty caused by the nuclear
eﬀects can be signiﬁcantly reduced in a speciﬁc diﬀerence of the g-factors of
H- and Li-like ions of the same isotope. This gives a good opportunity for
tests of the magnetic sector of QED in the presence of a strong Coulomb
ﬁeld. The most accurate calculations of the g-factor of Li-like ions in the
range Z=6−92 were performed in Ref. [96].

11

The g-factor of a H-like ion with nonzero nuclear spin can be approxi-

mated as

g = g(e) F (F + 1) + j(j + 1) − I(I + 1)

2F (F + 1)

−

m
mp

gI

F (F + 1) + I(I + 1) − j(j + 1)
2F (F + 1)

.

(17)

Here m and mp are the electron and the proton mass, respectively, g(e) is the
bound-electron g-factor deﬁned above, gI = µ/µnI is the nuclear g-factor,
µn = |e|/2mpc is the nuclear magneton, j and I are the electron and the
nucleus angular momentum, respectively, and F is the total angular momen-
tum of the ion. According to formula (17) the contribution of the nuclear
g-factor is suppressed by factor m/mp compared to the electronic g-factor. It
follows that measurements of the g-factor of ions with nonzero nuclear spin
with a 10−9 accuracy would provide determinations of the nuclear magnetic
moments on the 10−6 accuracy level. Calculations of various corrections to
formula (17) were presented in Ref. [97].

Another possibility for investigations of the g-factor of ions with nonzero
nuclear spin was discussed in Ref. [98]. In that work it was shown that the
transition probability between the ground state hyperﬁne splitting compo-
nents of a hydrogenlike ion, including the QED and nuclear corrections, is
given by

w =

α
3

ω3
m2

I
2I + 1 h

g(e) − gI

m
2
mp i

,

(18)

where ω is the transition frequency. Formula (18) allows one to calculate
the QED and nuclear corrections to the transition probability using the cor-
responding corrections to the bound-electron g-factor. In particular, it was
found [98] that in cases of Pb and Bi the QED and nuclear corrections in-
[99] the life time
crease the transition probability by about 0.3%. In Ref.
of the upper hyperﬁne splitting component in 209Bi82+ was measured to be
τexp=397.5(1.5) µs. This result is in a good agreement with the theoretical
prediction [98] τtheo = 399.01(19)µs. Using formula (18) and the experimen-
tal values of the hyperﬁne splitting and the transition probability in 209Bi82+
[68, 99], one ﬁnds the experimental value of the bound-electron g-factor in Bi
to be 1.7343(33). The corresponding theoretical value is 1.7310. The values

12

of the individual contributions to the bound-electron g-factor in Bi are given
in Table 6. From this table, it can be seen that including the QED correction
is needed to obtain the agreement between the theory and experiment.

5 Parity nonconservation eﬀects with heavy

ions

Investigations of parity nonconservation (PNC) eﬀects in atomic systems play
a prominent role in tests of the Standard Model (SM) [100]. The well-known
cesium experiment by Wieman’s group [101], compared to the most elabo-
rated theoretical result (see Ref. [102] and references therein), provided the
most accurate test of electroweak theory at the low-energy regime. Further
improvement of tests of the Standard Model with neutral atoms, from theo-
retical side, is mainly limited by diﬃculties with accurate calculations of the
electron-correlation eﬀects. For this reason, the PNC experiments with heavy
few-electron ions, where the electron-correlation eﬀects can be evaluated to a
high accuracy, seem highly desirable. The PNC eﬀects in these systems were
ﬁrst discussed in Refs. [103, 104, 105]. For tests of the spin-independent part
of the week interaction, a promising situation occurs in heavy He-like ions
with the nuclear charge number near Z = 64 and Z = 92, where two levels of
the opposite parity, 21S0 and 23P0, are very close to each other. The study
of PNC eﬀects with these ions requires precise knowledge of the 21S0 − 23P0
energy diﬀerence. The most accurate calculations of this diﬀerence, which
include a complete set of two-electron QED corrections, were performed in
Ref. [67]. In Table 7, the results of Ref. [67] are compared with the related
data by other authors.

A feasible PNC experiment with heavy ions was suggested by Labzowsky
et al. [108]. Instead of the standard measurement of the circular dichroism
which is rather diﬃcult to perform with x-ray radiation, it was proposed
to study a quenching-type experiment with interference of hyperﬁne- and
weak-quenched transitions in polarized He-like europium. The idea of the
experiment is the following. The basic one-photon decay 21S0 − 11S0 channel
is the hyperﬁne-quenching (hfq) M1 transition which is due to the hyperﬁne
mixing of the 21S0 and 23S1 levels. Another one-photon decay 21S0 − 11S0
channel is due to the mixing of the 21S0 and 23P0 levels caused by the weak

13

interaction of electrons with the nucleus and due to the hyperﬁne mixing of
the 23P0 and 23P1 levels. As a result, the total amplitude of the one-photon
21S0 − 11S0 transition is a mixture of the basic M1 and the additional E1
amplitude. The polarization of Eu61+ in the 21S0 state can be described by
the density matrix [108]

ρ =

1
2I + 1 h

1 +

3λ0
I + 1

(ν · I)

,

i

(19)

where I is the operator of the total angular momentum, ν is the unit vector
directed along the ion polarization, and λ0 is the degree of polarization (λ0 ≤
1). The probability for the emission of a photon in direction n is given by
[108]

dW (n) =

[1 + ε(ν · n)]dΩ ,

(20)

WM1
4π

where WM1 is the total probability of the hfq M1 21S0 − 11S0 transition and
ε is the asymmetry coeﬃcient caused by the PNC eﬀects. Our evaluation of
this coeﬃcient yields

ε = 6λ0q

WE1/WM1 /(I + 1) ,

(21)

where WE1 is the total probability of the weak-hyperﬁne quenching E1 21S0 −
11S0 transition. We note that expression (21) diﬀers by about a factor of 2
from the related expression derived in Ref. [108].

The experiment should consist in observing the diﬀerence of the transi-
tion probability (20) due to a change of the ion polarization direction or,
equivalently, due to rotating the detector around the beam direction by an
angle π. The value of this diﬀerence is proportional to the asymmetry pa-
rameter ε. Our calculation of this parameter for europium employing the
[67] (see Table 7) yields ε ≈ 0.0004λ0. This
transition energies from Ref.
[108].
value is almost four times larger compared to that obtained in Ref.
This is due to a change of the 21S0 −23P0 energy diﬀerence, compared to that
[108], and due to the change of the expression for ε discussed
used in Ref.
above.

The experiment under consideration requires preparing and storing a po-
larized ion beam. A promising idea for preparation of polarized ion beams
was suggested in Ref. [109].

Conclusion

In this paper we have considered the present status of calculations of the
QED eﬀects in heavy few-electron ions. Calculations of the PNC eﬀects for
heavy ions have also been discussed.

To date, the most accurate tests of QED eﬀects on binding energies in
a strong Coulomb ﬁeld have been accomplished in heavy Li-like ions: on
a 0.5% accuracy level to ﬁrst order in α and on a 15% accuracy level to
second order in α. An improvement of the experimental accuracy by an
order of magnitude accompanied by more accurate determinations of higher-
order QED and nuclear-size eﬀects would provide tests of QED beyond the
external ﬁeld approximation.

High-precision measurements of the hyperﬁne splitting in heavy H-and
Li-like ions of the same isotope are highly desirable. They would give a
unique opportunity for tests of the magnetic sector of QED in the strongest
electric ﬁeld currently available for experimental study.

The QED theory of the bound-electron g-factor has been probed by di-
rect measurements on hydrogenlike carbon and oxygen. These measurements
have also provided a new determination of the electron mass with an accuracy
which is four times better than that of the previously accepted value. Exten-
tions of these measurements to higher-Z systems and to ions with nonzero
nuclear spin would provide independent determinations of the ﬁne structure
constant and the nuclear magnetic moments.

Investigations of the PNC eﬀects with heavy ions seem very promising

for tests of the Standard Model.

Metastable 2S muonic-hydrogen atoms undergo collisional 2S-quenching, with rates which depend
strongly on whether the µp kinetic energy is above or below the 2S → 2P energy threshold. Above
threshold, collisional 2S → 2P excitation followed by fast radiative 2P → 1S deexcitation is allowed.

Muonic hydrogen (µ−p) is a simple atomic system, sen-
sitive to basic features of the electromagnetic and weak
interactions. Of particular interest is its metastable 2S
state, long sought after for measuring the µp(2S)-Lamb
shift, Lµ. Vacuum polarization dominates Lµ. It shifts
the 2S level by −0.2 eV below the 2P level [1, 2]. A
measurement of Lµ is in progress at the Paul Scherrer
Institute (PSI), Switzerland [3]. We report here the data
analysis of a preliminary stage of this experiment made
at low H2 gas pressure pH2 = 0.6 hPa [4].

Muons stopped in H2 gas form highly excited µp
atoms [5]. A cascade of both collisionally-induced and
radiative deexcitations leads to the 1S ground state or,
with a probability ε2S (few %), to the 2S state. The
µp(1S) kinetic energy distribution E1S
kin has been mea-
sured at pH2 = 0.06 · · · 16 hPa [6], and cascade simula-
tions show that E1S
kin do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly
under our conditions [5].

kin and E2S

The 2S state lifetime is, in absence of collisions, es-
sentially equal to the muon lifetime τµ = 2.2 µs. In H2
gas, collisional 2S-quenching occurs, with diﬀerent pro-
cesses for kinetic energies E2S
kin above or below the 2S →
2P transition threshold which is (1 + mµp/mH2)|Lµ| ≈
0.3 eV in the lab frame:

(i) Most µp(2S) atoms are formed at energies above
this threshold [6] where a collisional 2S → 2P Stark tran-
sition, followed by 2P → 1S deexcitation with 1.9 keV
Kα x ray emission (the 2P -lifetime is 8.5 ps),

µp(2S) + H2 → µp(2P ) + H2 → µp(1S) + H2 + Kα , (1)

2S

leads to fast 2S-depletion (collisional quenching). A life-
time τ short
∼ 100 ns/pH2[hPa] was predicted for this
short-lived 2S-component [7, 8, 9]. This is too short to
have been seen in previous searches for Kα x rays delayed
with respect to the µp(2S) formation time [10, 11, 12]. In
this Letter we report on the ﬁrst measurement of τ short
and the corresponding population εshort
2S .

2S

(ii) Due to elastic collisions, a fraction of the µp(2S)
atoms decelerates to energies below 0.3 eV where pro-
cess (1) is energetically forbidden. This fraction is
the long-lived 2S-component. A recent experiment [13]
showed that its dominant quenching process is nonra-
diative deexcitation to the ground state, with lifetime
2S ≈ 1.3 µs at 0.6 hPa, and population εlong
τ long
The cascade time T µp

cas is the mean delay between µp-
atom formation and ﬁnal deexcitation to the ground state
(when a µp K-line x ray, other than from µp(2S) decay,
is emitted). The T µp
cas value results from the average of
the various cascade deexcitation processes, and depends
on pH2. It was calculated [5] but never measured for µp.
In our experiment, muons stop in H2 gas containing a
small admixture of N2 (air), and we measure simultane-
ously the three time distributions:

2S ≈ 1%.

– Kα , i.e., µp(n = 2 → 1) x rays (1.898 keV),
– K>β, i.e., µp(n > 3 → 1) x rays (2.45(2) keV [14]),
– µN , i.e., µN(n = 5 → 4) x rays (3.08 keV [15]).
The µp(n = 3 → 1) Kβ-line (2.249 keV) is not well sep-
arated from Kα and K>β. The 0.4(1)% air admixture
in the H2 was useful for calibrating x-ray energies and

times. The µN time distribution is similar to that of
µp formation because the µN cascade time is negligibly
short (∼ 10−10 s) [16]. The µp cascade time will therefore
show up as a time delay in the Kα and K>β distributions
compared to µN. The signature for 2S radiative decay
will be a tail in Kα not present in K>β. The muon trans-
fer rates µp + N → µN + p are ∼ 103 s−1 for µp(1S) and
∼ 104 s−1 for µp(2S) [17], too small to aﬀect our results.
The experiment was performed at the recently devel-
oped low-energy µ− source attached to the πE5 beam
line at PSI [18]. It provides ∼ 103 s−1 µ− with energies
of a few keV. The muons were axially injected into a
1 m long, 20 cm bore solenoid operated at 5 T, con-
taining the muon entrance detectors and the gas target
(see [3]). Two detectors, based on nanometer-thick car-
bon foils, signaled the arrival of slow muons [19]. Muons
were stopped in a 20 cm long target vessel ﬁlled with
0.6 hPa H2 gas (temperature 290 K), and µp atoms were
formed in a volume of 0.5 × 1.5 × 20 cm3. Twenty large-
area avalanche photodiodes (LAAPD), each with sen-
sitive area 13.5 × 13.5 mm2, were used as x-ray detec-
tors [20]. Muon-decay electrons were detected by a set of
plastic scintillators and also by the LAAPDs. More than
5 × 105 events, each where an x ray was followed by an
electron, were analyzed.

Calibration data were used for each LAAPD to deduce
the energy Ex and time tx (relative to muon entrance)
of a measured x ray. Typical resolutions (full width at
half maximum) were ∆Ex/Ex ≈ 25% and ∆tx ≈ 35 ns
for 2-keV x rays. Most µp x rays were found in the time
interval 300 ≤ tx ≤ 600 ns, corresponding to the widely-
distributed muon slowing-down times.

The Kα, K>β, and µN time distributions were deter-
mined from a ﬁt of the Ex spectra for diﬀerent tx inter-
vals. The useful tx range (0.2 · · · 6.5 µs) was divided into
28 intervals (50, 100, and 500 ns wide). For each interval
an Ex spectrum was produced. Three typical spectra are
shown in Fig. 1, one at times of µp formation and deex-
citation (top), and two at later times. The function ﬁt to
each spectrum is composed of several x-ray lines and a
continuous background. Each line is the sum of a Gaus-
sian peak and a tail towards lower energies (an LAAPD
characteristic), with energy-dependent weights [4].

The lines ﬁtted in Fig. 1 correspond to x rays from µp
(Kα, Kβ, and K>β), µN (main transitions at 1.67, 3.08,
and 6.65 keV [15]), µO (2.19, 4.02, and 8.69 keV), and µC
(4.89 keV). The intensities for the Kα, K>β, 3.08, 4.02,
4.89, and 6.65 keV lines were free parameters, whereas
the relative intensities of the other lines as well as the
positions and widths of all lines were ﬁxed by requiring
global consistency for all data [4] and considering known
yields [21]. The late-time 2-keV peak (see Fig. 1, bottom)
is due to µp x rays from second-muon stops, i.e., muons
entering the target at random times shortly after a ﬁrst-
muon which deﬁned tx = 0. The µC4→3 (4.89 keV) line at
late times arises from µp atoms drifting to the polypropy-

FIG. 1: (color online). X-ray energy spectra (3 of 28) for dif-

for µp Kα, Kβ, K>β, µN, µO, µC(4.89 keV), and a continuous
background (Bgr).

lene foils in front of the LAAPDs where muon transfer to
C atoms occurred. The continuous background is due to
x rays with energy > 10 keV, e.g., µC K and L line transi-
tions, whose deposited charge was not fully ampliﬁed by
the LAAPDs. It was well modeled by a sum of an expo-
nential and a linear function, with two amplitudes as free
parameters. The full details of the extensive background
studies are found in [4].

The ﬁtted intensities (with statistical errors) of the
28 energy spectra are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of tx,
for the three lines µN(3.08 keV), µp K>β, and Kα. The
late-time events are caused by second-muon stops. The
tx spectra from diﬀerent LAAPD positions show [4] that
for muons not stopped during their ﬁrst pass through the
gas target, a considerable fraction was reﬂected at the
gold-plated back side of the vessel and stopped during
the return pass. Consequently, the µN spectrum (show-
ing the muon stop-time distribution) was represented by
a sum of two functions, each one the convolution of a
Gaussian with an exponential (Fig. 2, top). The simul-

FIG. 2: Fit functions (solid line) and residuals (normalized
by the errors) for ﬁts to the x-ray time spectra for the lines
µN(3.08 keV) (top), µp − K>β (middle), and Kα (bottom).
Each point results from a ﬁt of the x-ray energy spectrum for
the corresponding tx-interval (50, 100, and 500 ns wide). The
dotted lines in the µN spectrum are the functions for incoming
(inc), reﬂected (ref), and second (bg) muons.
In the K>β
spectrum the dotted line is the ﬁt function without cascade
time. In the Kα spectrum the 2S-tail, i.e., the contribution
of the short-lived µp(2S) state, is shown as dotted line. The
dashed line is the ﬁt function minus the 2S-tail.

taneous ﬁt of the three time spectra, using the common
muon stop-time distribution, gives values for the intensi-
ties AµN, A>β, and Aα.

The K>β and Kα spectra are delayed and slightly
broadened with respect to µN due to the µp cascade time.
It is not possible to extract the precise shape of the cas-
cade time distribution from the data, but calculations [5]
indicate that the K>β cascade has an approximately ex-
ponential time distribution, whereas the Kα cascade has
the same asymptotic behaviour but includes a “build-up”
character at earlier times. The µN ﬁt function was there-
fore convoluted with an exponential (parameter τcas) to
obtain the K>β function and further convoluted with a

A simultaneous ﬁt of the three time spectra was per-
formed, resulting in χ2 = 57.5 for 67 degrees of free-
dom. The ﬁt functions and residuals are shown in
Fig. 2. The scatter of the residuals conﬁrms that no
relevant systematic deviations exist between the data
and the model. The resulting cascade time slope is

deduced from a Monte Carlo simulation of the experi-
ment, based on the known distribution of E2S
kin [6] and
on calculated cross sections [9] for process (1) and elastic
collisions. It was found that (i) some µp(2S) atoms reach
the target walls before being quenched; (ii) the solid an-
gle for Kα detection varies with time due to the µp(2S)
motion; (iii) because of collisions, the E2S
kin distribution
depends on time, and hence so do the mean cross sections
and µp velocities. Those eﬀects modify the 2S tail shape
at the late times where the experiment is most sensitive.

The µp cascade time and the 2S-tail have been disen-
tangled from the stop-time distribution for the ﬁrst time.
This has been made possible by the high statistics, the
low gas pressure, and the good stop-time resolution. The
measured µp cascade time T µp
cas = (37 ± 5) ns is less than
half the ≈ 90 ns value predicted for 0.6 hPa by cascade
calculations [5]. The measured value may be slightly af-
fected by a possible diﬀerence in the µ− atomic capture
times of N2 and H2 predicted by some models [22]: the
muon energy from which capture occurs is expected to in-
crease with Z [23], so µN atoms can form earlier than µp
atoms during the muon stopping, an eﬀect which would
result in an even lower measured T µp
cas value. A result
which does not depend on such eﬀects is the measured
diﬀerence T α
cas = (13 ± 4) ns, also signiﬁcantly
smaller than the calculated value of ≈ 25 ns. The calcu-
lated cascade times may be too long since Coulomb de-
excitations, which dominate the cascade at high n-levels
even at low pH2 [5], may be accompanied by simultaneous
Auger transitions, an eﬀect not yet considered.

We have compared the measured radiative 2S-lifetime
with the results of calculations. Since the existing cal-
culated cross sections neglect molecular eﬀects we al-
lowed for the extreme cases where the H2 molecule is
taken as two separate H atoms or as a single atom.
Analysing the simulated data in the time region where
the experiment is sensitive, we obtained a value of
(178 ± 30) ns which agrees well with the experimental re-
sult τ short
−29 ns. This conﬁrms the validity of the
cross sections calculated for µp(2S) + H → µp(2P ) + H
Stark transitions [8, 9]. The quenching rate for the
short-lived 2S-component, when normalized to liquid-
hydrogen atom density (LHD, 4.25 × 1022 atoms/cm3),
is λquench

than for the long-lived one [13].

2S-population ε2S = (2.49 ± 0.17)% at 0.6 hPa deduced
directly from the measured µp K-line yields [14].

We conclude that there is now good understanding of

both the short- and long-lived µp(2S) dynamics.

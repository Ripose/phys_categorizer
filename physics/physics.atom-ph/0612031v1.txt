We present the ﬁrst high-resolution spectroscopic study of LiCs. LiCs is formed in a heat pipe oven
and studied via laser-induced ﬂuorescence Fourier-transform spectroscopy. By exciting molecules
through the X1Σ+-B1Π and X1Σ+-D1Π transitions vibrational levels of the X1Σ+ ground state have
been observed up to 3 cm−1 below the dissociation limit enabling an accurate construction of the
potential. Furthermore, rovibrational levels in the a3Σ+ triplet ground state have been observed
because the excited states obtain suﬃcient triplet character at the corresponding excited atomic
asymptote. With the help of coupled channels calculations accurate singlet and triplet ground state
potentials were derived reaching the atomic ground state asymptote and allowing ﬁrst predictions
of cold collision properties of Li + Cs pairs.

subject to a large interest since they can be formed at
temperatures below 1 mK [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and possess a
large permanent electric dipole moment for deeply bound
singlet levels [6, 7]. This combination of properties en-
ables electric ﬁeld control of ultracold collisions [8, 9]
and cold chemical reactions [10, 11] and holds promises
for applications in quantum computation [12]. Precise

atomic species can be achieved through sympathetic
cooling by the other species [15, 16, 17]. The interspecies
interaction strength can be varied through magnetic
Feshbach resonances and has a large inﬂuence on a
variety of eﬀects such as phase-separation between a
Bose-Einstein condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas
[18] and the transition to a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer
superﬂuid state in dilute Fermi gases [19]. Understand-

ously, inelastic collisions [20] and sympathetic cooling of
Li by Cs in an optical dipole trap [21] have been studied.
Recent theoretical work considers LiCs in strong dc elec-
tric ﬁelds and its inﬂuence on rovibrational dynamics [22]
and Li-Cs collision cross sections [9].

Although LiCs was observed already in 1928 by Walter
and Barratt through absorption in a mixture of metal-
lic vapors [23], very few and no high-resolution spectro-
scopic studies have been made until now. In the 1980’s
Vadla et al. studied the repulsive Li(2p)+Cs(6s) asymp-
tote [24]. More recently LiCs molecules were formed on
He nanodroplets and excitation spectra of the d3Π ←
a3Σ+ transition were recorded and modeled [25]. Ab ini-
tio potentials were calculated by Korek et al. [26] (see
Fig. 1) and more recently an extended theoretical study
was done by Aymar and Dulieu [6]. The theoretical po-
tentials provide a good starting point for analysis of the
spectra obtained in the present work.

Here we present a high-resolution spectroscopic study
of the LiCs molecule. Similar to our previous studies
[27, 28] we apply Fourier-transform spectroscopy of laser-
induced ﬂuorescence from LiCs molecules formed in a
heat-pipe, because this technique is suitable for collect-
ing a large amount of accurate experimental data. By us-
ing properly chosen excitation schemes (see e.g. [27, 28])
we can measure transition frequencies to a wide range
of vibrational levels in the singlet X1Σ+ as well as in
the triplet a3Σ+ ground states, especially levels close to
the asymptote. Since the two states are coupled at long
internuclear distances by the hyperﬁne interaction it is
not correct to treat them separately in this region, as it
would lead to model potentials which are unable to repro-
duce the experimental observations close to the asymp-
tote. Therefore, the aim of our experimental work is
to collect experimental data on both ground states and
to ﬁt accurate experimental potential energy curves si-
multaneously for both states - the indispensable starting
point for a study of the molecular structure of LiCs or for
modeling of cold collision processes on the Li(2s)+Cs(6s)
asymptote. We apply these potential curves within a cou-

The article is organized as follows: The experimental
setup and excitation schemes are presented in Section II.
In Section III we describe the analysis of the obtained
spectra. The procedure for construction of potential en-
ergy curves is described in Section IV and the potentials
are reported. In Section V we give our conclusion and
an outlook for further experimental study needed for a
quantitative description of ultracold collisions in Li + Cs.

II. EXPERIMENT: MOLECULE FORMATION
AND SPECTROSCOPY

A. Molecule formation

LiCs molecules are formed in a stainless steel heat-pipe
identical to the one described in Ref. [29], except for one
modiﬁcation described below. The heat-pipe (960 mm
long and 34 mm outer diameter) is ﬁlled with 6 g Li and
5 g Cs (the Cs, in a closed ampoule, is loaded into the
side container [29] [44]) and typically operated with 3-6
mbar Ar buﬀer gas pressure.

Since the vapor pressure diﬀerence between Li and Cs

2

at a common temperature is extremely large, we mod-
iﬁed the design of Ref. [29] in order to obtain a three-
section heat-pipe, which is more suitable for producing a
vapor mixture with similar concentrations of Li and Cs
and hence for forming LiCs molecules [30]. In Ref. [29]
the central 60 cm of the heat-pipe is heated uniformly
in a commercial oven (Carbolite); here we mount two
stainless steel ’shells’ (20 cm long, 50 mm inner diameter)
concentrically around the heat-pipe and seal up the ends
facing towards the center of the oven such that only the
central 20 cm of the heat-pipe are heated directly in the
oven. By blowing air into the open ends, which extend
outside of the oven, we can maintain a lower temperature
in the sections shielded by the shells than in the central
part of the heat-pipe.

The heat-pipe is conditioned by heating it to temper-
atures of about 580 ◦C under 10 mbar Ar pressure; sub-
sequently the Cs ampoule is broken by shaking the tube.
Operating temperatures are 540 ◦C in the central part
and 370 ◦C in the outer sections. The heat-pipe oven
was operated for more than 200 hours over a 10 month
period and was still in good working conditions at the
end of this period.

B. Laser-induced ﬂuorescence Fourier-transform
spectroscopy

Laser-induced ﬂuorescence from LiCs molecules is ob-
served after excitation on the B1Π ← X1Σ+ and D1Π ←
X1Σ+ transitions. The B1Π ← X1Σ+ transitions were
excited using a Coherent 599 dye laser (with DCM dye)
at frequencies in the range 15529-16123 cm−1 and a Co-
herent 699 dye laser at frequencies in the range 16397-
17022 cm−1 (with Rhodamine 6G dye as well as with
a mixture of Rhodamine 6G and Rhodamine B). The
D1Π ← X1Σ+ transition was excited using the dye laser
with Rhodamine 6G at frequencies in the range 16663-
17238 cm−1 and a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser. The
strongest signals were observed for the B1Π ← X1Σ+ sys-
tem and we studied the ground states mainly through
this system. We note that indeed Walter and Bar-
ratt observed strong absorption in the range 15983-
16582 cm−1 [23] which according to Fig. 1 corresponds
to the B1Π ← X1Σ+ transition. At excitation frequen-
cies in the range ∼ 14900 − 15400 cm−1, we ﬁnd strong
ﬂuorescence due to Li2 and NaCs (Na is present as an
impurity in the Li sample) which overshadows a possi-
ble LiCs signal. Using an Ar-ion laser for excitation at
457.9 nm, 476.5 nm, 488.0 nm, 496.5 nm and 514.5 nm we
did not observe any ﬂuorescence from LiCs molecules,
only from Li2, LiNa and NaCs.
studied molecules
to
NaRb [27] and NaCs [28],
the low lying levels of
the excited B1Π state in LiCs turned out to be almost
free of local perturbations by the neighboring triplet
states b3Π and c3Σ+, which could be expected from
the theoretical potential curves (see Fig. 1). As a

previously

Contrary

the

consequence we were unable to register any transition
to the triplet ground state from the low lying B1Π state
levels. We searched instead for access to the triplet
manifold through local perturbations in the D1Π and
C1Σ+ states. Here we used a Coumarine 6 dye laser
with a typical power of 25 mW. Unfortunately within
the searched excitation frequency region of 18446 - 19039
cm−1 we were also not able to register transitions to the
triplet ground state.

The only ﬂuorescence to the a3Σ+ state is observed af-
ter excitation to high lying levels in the B1Π state. These
transitions are attributed to the long-range change over
of coupling case for the B1Π state itself rather than to
local mixing of the B1Π state at long range with the
neighboring triplet states [27, 28]. This conclusion is sup-
ported ﬁrst, by the observation that high lying B state
levels seem to be locally unperturbed. Second, the in-
tensity distribution of progressions from the high lying B
state levels to the ground singlet state could be explained
satisfactory by the Franck-Condon factors between the
X and the B states, including the highest v′′
X levels (con-
trary to the case of NaRb [27]). So transitions from these
B state levels to high lying a3Σ+ state levels will become
also probable when the B state changes its character from
Hund’s case (a) 1Π to Hund’s case (c) Ω = 1 at long in-
ternuclear distances. Indeed, in our spectra we ﬁnd tran-
sitions mainly to high v′′
a and none to the bottom of the
triplet ground state.

The laser-induced ﬂuorescence light is collected in the
direction opposite to the one of laser beam propagation
and recorded by a Bruker IFS 120HR Fourier-Transform
Spectrometer (FTS). For detection we use a photomul-
tiplier (Hamamatsu R928) or a Si-photodiode. In order
to avoid illumination of the detector by the He-Ne laser
(632.8 nm), used in the FTS for calibration and stepping
control, a notch ﬁlter (8 nm full width at half maximum)
is introduced in the beam path, which suppresses also the
ﬂuorescence induced in the corresponding spectral region.
The resolution of the FTS is typically set to 0.03 - 0.05
cm−1. The uncertainty of the line positions is estimated
to be 1/10 of the resolution. For lines with signal-to-noise
ratio less than 3 the uncertainty is gradually increased.
Each spectrum results typically from an average of 10-20
scans, but the number of scans is varied from 5 to 350
depending on the signal strength for the features of in-
terest in the spectra. For improving the signal-to-noise
ratio, the spectral window for some spectra is limited by
using color glass ﬁlters or interference ﬁlters. In order to
facilitate the identiﬁcation in such cases we recorded also
a spectrum at the same excitation frequency without ﬁl-
ters, but with lower resolution (0.1 cm−1) and a smaller
number of scans.

A list of all excitation frequencies used in these ex-
periments together with the assignment of the excitation
transitions are given in Tables 3 and 4 of the supplemen-
tary materials [31].

III. ANALYSIS OF SPECTRA

A. The X1Σ+ state

Assignment of the large number of transitions, about
6600, to the X1Σ+ state is done in an iterative process;
by gradually improving the potential for the X1Σ+ state,
more and more transitions can be correctly assigned.

Initially, we identify several strong doublet series which
are clearly recognized as P-R components from the reg-
ular development of the doublet spacing. Among these
series we choose those with similar spacing, i.e., with sim-
ilar rotational quantum numbers. Based on the theoret-
ical potential for the X1Σ+ state [26] we make an ini-
tial guess for the vibrational and the rotational quantum
numbers of these ﬂuorescence progressions. The quan-
tum numbers that give the closest agreement with the
theoretical vibrational and rotational spacings are as-
signed and a small set of Dunham coeﬃcients is ﬁtted.
If the ﬁt is successful we can use the ﬁtted coeﬃcients
to assign new progressions; if not, a reassignment of the
quantum numbers must be made. After some iterations
we obtain a self consistent set of assigned experimental
progressions which can be satisfactory described by a few
Dunham coeﬃcients. This is a ﬁrst hint of a correct ro-
tational numbering. Here we point out the very good
quality of the theoretical calculations [6, 26]; the theo-
retical rotational numbering needed a correction by only
two or three units.

When the list of assigned transitions reaches several
hundreds we perform the ﬁrst potential ﬁts. Initially, we
start with a pointwise potential (deﬁned in Section IV)
based on the theoretical curve [26] and improve it using
the procedure described in Ref. [32]. In the further anal-
ysis of the spectra we apply this pointwise potential curve
since outside the range of the ﬁtted v′′ and J ′′, it usually
possesses better predictive properties than the Dunham
type coeﬃcients. Moreover our experience from previous
studies [27, 29] shows that a potential curve which ﬁts
long vibrational progressions recorded at high precision
in a wide range of rotational quantum numbers indicates
the correctness also of the vibrational numbering.

Finally, the established vibrational numbering was
conﬁrmed by assigning several progressions for the less
abundant 6Li133Cs molecule. These progressions ﬁt to
the experimental potential based only on 7Li133Cs data
when the appropriate reduced mass is applied [33].

In order to describe the important long-range part of
the potential, it is of great value to collect data with tran-
sitions to high-lying levels of the ground state. Since we
noticed during the measurements that transitions to such
high-lying levels originate from high-lying vibrational lev-
els of the B1Π state, we studied this state in order to
optimize the experimental conditions for observation of
near asymptotic levels in the X1Σ+ state (a report on
the B1Π state is in preparation [34]). From the avail-
able experimental term energies of the B1Π state levels a
preliminary potential for the B1Π state was ﬁtted. This

potential was then used to predict transition frequencies
for excitation transitions with large Franck-Condon fac-
tors. In this way we recorded systematically transitions
from v′ = 24 and 25 to the X1Σ+ state for a wide range of
J ′, thus adding several ro-vibrational levels with v′′
X = 49
and 50 to the ground state dataset. In most cases such
high-lying levels of the X1Σ+ state could be observed
with a suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio only by increasing
the number of summed scans to several hundreds. We
searched for excitations to higher vibrational levels of
the B1Π state within predicted spectral regions but we
were not able to register ﬂuorescence from v′ ≥ 26 to the
X1Σ+ state, most likely due to possible predissociation
or unfavorable transition probabilities.

pled channels calculation for J ′′ = N ′′ = 17 in which
the hyperﬁne interaction between the states is included.
The progression to the X1Σ+ state is formed by Q-lines
whereas the progression to the a3Σ+ state consists of
transitions to N ′′
a =15, 17 and 19. Lines not marked
in the ﬁgure belong to another progression also assigned
and used in our analysis.

The rotational assignment of the triplet lines is
straightforward since we always ﬁnd the progression to
the X1Σ+ state which shares the excited level in the B1Π
state with the progression to the a3Σ+ state. The vibra-
tional assignment of the transitions to the triplet ground
state is done in the same way as for the X1Σ+ state,
however, no transitions in 6Li133Cs were observed and
hence the vibrational assignment relies only on the inter-
nal consistency of the total procedure.

C. Data sets

Altogether about 6600 transitions to the X1Σ+ state
(130 of them belong to 6Li133Cs) and 180 transitions to
the a3Σ+ state in 7Li133Cs were assigned (see Tables 1
and 2 of the supplementary materials [31]). The corre-
sponding distribution of vibrational and rotational quan-
tum numbers is shown in Figure 4. For the X1Σ+ state
we observe transitions to v′′
X = 0 − 50 in 7Li133Cs. The
set of a3Σ+ state vibrational levels covers v′′
a = 4 − 12
and the vibrational numbering established in this study
agrees with that from the theoretical potential. The lim-
ited number of experimental data, however, might lead
to a revision of this assignment in the future, if additional
data on the a3Σ+ state are collected. Although the data
set for the a3Σ+ state may seem fragmentary compared
to our similar studies in other molecules, the collection
of these data is extremely valuable, ﬁrst, due to the lim-
ited possibilities for exciting triplet states in LiCs and,
second, since a proper description of the Li(2s)+Cs(6s)
asymptote is only possible if both the X1Σ+ state and
a3Σ+ state are treated in a coupled channels manner as
described in the next section.

The triplet transitions are easily distinguished by their
hyperﬁne structure (HFS) which at our resolution con-
sists of three lines split by approximately 0.3 cm−1. Cal-
culations similar to those in Ref. [35] show that the ob-
served splitting is well reproduced by the Fermi contact
interaction model applying the atomic HFS constants for
7Li and 133Cs [36]. In Fig. 2 a transition to the triplet
state level v′′
a = 17 [45] is shown together with
the prediction of the splitting modeled by a coupled chan-
nels calculation as described in Section IV. A larger por-
tion of the same progression originating from the v′ = 25,
J ′ = 17 B1Π state level excited by a Q-type (∆J = 0)
transition is shown in Fig. 3. Some of the transitions
reach near asymptotic levels in both ground states. The
vertical dashed lines indicate the prediction of the cou-

is the frequently applied functional form of the exchange
energy [37] which is added for the triplet state and sub-
tracted for the singlet state.

The pointwise short-range and the long-range poten-
tials are connected at a point Ro ensuring a smooth tran-
sition between both potential branches. Ro is chosen as
described in Refs. [27, 38], the C6 and C8 coeﬃcients are
ﬁxed to their theoretical values [39, 40, 41], γ and β are
estimated using the ionization potentials for Li and Cs
[42] according to Ref. [37], while U∞, C10 and Aex are
adjusted during the ﬁtting procedure.

In the ﬁrst step of the ﬁtting procedure we adjust only
the pointwise part of the potential for the X1Σ+ state.
The experimental transition frequencies are ﬁtted by ad-
justing the parameters of the pointwise potential and the
term energies of the excited levels.

As we choose the origin of the potential energy at the
minimum of the X1Σ+ state potential, in the second step
of the ﬁtting procedure we need to determine the term
energies of the a3Σ+ state levels with respect to the X1Σ+
state. We do this using spectra where we observe simulta-
neously progressions to the singlet and the triplet states
originating from a common upper state level. For a given
singlet ground state potential we calculate the term en-
ergies of the triplet state using the energy of the excited
level, determined in the previous step, and the progres-
sion to the a3Σ+ state from this level. These a3Σ+ term
energies are then used in order to ﬁt the potential param-
eters of the triplet state. In this way we ensure always
a proper position of the a3Σ+ state with respect to the
X1Σ+ state.

In order to treat the hyperﬁne structure of the spectral
lines of the triplet state we checked the experimental data
that the splitting within our resolution is independent of
the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers v′′ and
N ′′ (except for very few cases, which we discuss below).
Therefore, we use the central component of the struc-
ture for identiﬁcation of the transition (see Fig. 2). We
convert the observed frequency to term energy, and take
into account the shift (-0.035 cm−1, which means the hy-
perﬁne level is more deeply bound than the unperturbed
level) of the selected hyperﬁne component from the un-
perturbed, hyperﬁne structure free one, thus we ﬁt with
the constructed term values a Born-Oppenheimer poten-
tial.

For high vibrational levels, and especially in cases of
close approach of singlet and triplet levels with the same
rotational quantum numbers, signiﬁcant deviations from
the Born-Oppenheimer picture can be expected [27, 28].
In 7Li133Cs this is most pronounced for v′′
X = 49 in the
singlet and v′′
a = 10 in the triplet state (see Fig. 3). The
deviations of the transitions determined by the Born-
Oppenheimer potentials (indicated with thick blue bars
in Fig. 5) from the experimental ones are signiﬁcant and
reach 0.06 cm−1 for v′′
X = 49 and J ′ = 24. Fig. 5 shows
the development from low J to high J.

Therefore,

in a third step, the Born-Oppenheimer
potentials are reﬁned by extending the single chan-

6

nel approach from the ﬁrst two steps and applying a
coupled channels calculation as discussed in detail in
Refs. [27, 28]. Brieﬂy, we calculate the diﬀerence be-
tween the single channel and coupled channels eigenval-
ues and subtract these diﬀerences from the experimen-
tally observed transition frequencies in order to obtain
the frequencies which would be observed without hyper-
ﬁne coupling between the singlet and the triplet ground
states. Next, these frequencies are used in a combined
ﬁt to adjust the parameters of the long-range extensions
of the potentials as well as in separate ﬁts (described for
the ﬁrst two steps) of the short range pointwise part of
the triplet and singlet potentials. Finally, the whole ﬁt-
ting procedure is repeated until the frequencies predicted
with the coupled channels calculations agree with the ex-
perimental observations. The importance of the coupled
channels calculation is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the
predictions for the coupled system are shown with thin
red bars together with the experimentally observed lines
and the single channel predictions (thick blue bars). The
degree of mixing between the triplet and singlet levels is
characterized by the expectation value of the total spin
operator |S| which is indicated for each line in Fig. 5.

In Tables I and II the ﬁtted potential energy curves of
the X1Σ+ and a3Σ+ states are given. The dispersion co-
eﬃcients C6 and C8 are taken from Refs. [40, 41]. With
the present data sets we are also able to reproduce the
experimental data with the same quality of the ﬁt by ﬁx-
ing these coeﬃcients to the values from Ref. [39]. The
reason for choosing the more recent values is that in this
case the ﬁtted C10 coeﬃcient diﬀers from the theoretical
prediction by only -17 %, whereas if the leading disper-
sion coeﬃcients are ﬁxed to the values from Ref. [39] the
diﬀerence reaches +68 % (the derived C10 amounts in
this case to 2.39 × 1010 cm−1˚A10). The selected set gives
good consistency with the expected accuracy of most re-
cent calculations of dispersion coeﬃcients.

The potential curve at any point R < Ro is deﬁned
by the natural cubic spline function through all points
listed in Tables I and II. For R ≥ Ro the long range
parameters and expressions (1) and (2) should be used.
For convenience of the reader, we give in Tables I and
II also Te (energy of potential minimum), Re (equilib-
rium distance), De (dissociation energy) and the dissoci-
ation energy D0 with respect to the lowest rovibrational
level (v′′ = 0, J ′′ = 0). While the model parameters for
the potential are listed with all relevant ﬁgures neces-
sary to reproduce the model with suﬃcient precision, for
the dissociation energies as physical quantities uncertain-
ties have been estimated according to the data situation.
Especially for the a3Σ+ state the uncertainty of the dis-
sociation energy is fairly large because of only few data,
especially no data are available yet for the lowest vibra-
tional levels.

The derived X1Σ+ state potential describes the experi-
mental transition frequencies involving 2400 energy levels
of the ground state with a standard deviation of 0.0057
cm−1 and a dimensionless standard deviation of ¯σ = 0.62.

FIG. 5: (Color online) Observed transitions to v′′
as indicated on the ﬁgure and excited
by a Q-type transition. An extended portion of the spectrum for J ′
a is shown in Fig. 3. For increasing
J ′
the singlet and triplet lines approach each other, resulting in strong perturbations of the line structure and the intensity
distribution within the HFS of the triplet line. Thick blue bars indicate the line positions as predicted by the Born-Oppenheimer
potentials. Thin red bars indicate the prediction of the coupled channels calculation. The numbers close to these bars are the
corresponding expectation values of the total spin operator |S|. For convenience spectra are adjusted such that the largest
peaks have similar intensities.

The high standard deviation of the ﬁt compared to the es-
timated error limits of 0.003 to 0.005 cm−1 from the typi-
cally applied experimental resolution of 0.03 - 0.05 cm−1
arises from a relatively large number of supplementary
spectra (giving rise to about 26 % of the identiﬁed tran-
sitions) recorded at lower resolution (0.1 cm−1) which
are also included in the data analysis. The standard de-
viation for the experimental data with uncertainties less
than 0.005 cm−1 (about 3600 transitions) amounts to
0.0030 cm−1 and ¯σ for this case is 0.88. The increase of
the dimensionless standard deviation is most likely due
to overestimated error limits of the low resolution lines.
The quality of the triplet state potential is assessed by
comparing the experimental term energies with the cal-
culated eigenvalues. The standard deviation amounts to
0.0044 cm−1 and the dimensionless standard deviation is
0.51.

In addition to the potential energy curves a set of Dun-
ham coeﬃcients was ﬁtted to the data for the singlet
ground state. These coeﬃcients are given in Table 5 of
the supplementary materials [31] and describe the exper-
imental data for all rotational quantum numbers and a
reduced set of v′′
X ≤ 45.

V. CONCLUSION

Highly accurate potentials for the singlet and triplet
ground state were derived, from which one can read oﬀ
the quality of the ab initio result [26]. Because a graph-
ical comparison is generally too rough we compare in-
stead two quantities, namely the dissociation energy De
and the equilibrium internuclear separation Re. For the
X1Σ+ state we ﬁnd De=5875.455 cm−1 and Re=3.6681 ˚A
with the corresponding ab initio results being 5996 cm−1
and 3.615 ˚A, respectively [26]. For the a3Σ+ state the
present work reveals De=309 cm−1 and Re=5.2472 ˚A,
while the corresponding ab initio calculations give, re-
spectively, 307 cm−1 and 5.229 ˚A.

The energy diﬀerence in the case of the singlet state
could correspond to at least one vibrational level more
than the total number of levels accommodated in the
derived potential (55 for J=0), but for the triplet state
the agreement is surprisingly good. Such precision is
rather good and helpful for guiding the spectroscopic
assignment. The amplitude of the exchange interaction
which can be estimated from the diﬀerence of the the-
oretical asymptotic singlet and triplet potentials comes
close (30%) to the value from the ﬁt.

Cold collisions were studied for Li+Cs pairs through
sympathetic cooling by Mudrich et al. [21] and trap loss

gives loss rates for processes where excited states are in-
volved and thus cannot be related directly to cold colli-
sion calculations which are now possible with the ground
state potentials reported in this paper. The former work
derives the cross section for elastic scattering of unpolar-
ized atomic pairs in the hyperﬁne ground states fLi = 1
and fCs = 3 to be 8(4) × 10−12 cm2 assuming Wigner’s
threshold behavior for s-wave scattering, i.e., the cross
section is independent of collision energy. In this collision
process the channels f =2, 3, and 4 of the total atomic
angular momentum ~f = ~fLi + ~fCs are involved. Using

the potentials reported in this work the cross sections
of these elastic channels were calculated for an energy
range up to 100µK. The values for f = 3 and f = 2
are at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of
f = 4, thus only this channel should be taken into ac-
count for the comparison to the experimentally derived
value which has 50 % uncertainty. The value of this cross
section varies only from 2.5 to 2.0 × 10−12 cm2 from zero
to 100µK energy. Thus the threshold law is suﬃciently
well fulﬁlled. By weighting the cross section of f = 4
with the statistical weight 9/(9+7+5) according to all
existing channels we get as cross section of the unpolar-
ized collision 1.1 × 10−12 cm2, which is about a factor 8
smaller than the one derived from the experiment, but
within two times the given error. The potential for the
singlet ground state is well determined by a large body
of data (2397 levels), but the triplet ground state was
only determined by 89 levels. Thus we believe that the
diﬀerence is not directing to a discrepancy between both
results but ask for more spectroscopic data or more pre-
cise cross section measurements or a direct observation
of Feshbach resonances which can be incorporated in the
ﬁt of potential functions to obtain a full description of
the spectroscopy and the cold collisions of Li + Cs atom
pairs. Calculations of scattering length for the singlet
and triplet states show that for the singlet ground state
it is already well determined by the present study and
will be 50(20) a0 (atomic unit a0 = 0.529 × 10−10 m),

but in the case of the triplet state large values with dif-
ferent signs were obtained during the evaluation with po-
tentials represented with spline coeﬃcients or with piece-
wise analytic functions as used in some of our other work
(see e.g. [28]). Thus, such values are not yet reliable
and calculations of Feshbach resonances would be of no
value. To make such calculations reliable more spectro-
scopic data for the low vibrational levels of the a3Σ+
state and of near asymptotic levels of both ground states
is needed. In addition to collecting data by exciting to
high lying levels of the B1Π state we searched for, but did
not yet ﬁnd, other excitation channels which will lead to
combined ﬂuorescence to both ground states, especially
to asymptotic levels. For improving predictions of ap-
propriate excitations we started new experiments to get

precise data of various excited states. The analysis of
the states B1Π and D1Π is almost complete and will be
published in a forthcoming paper [34].

We have calculated elastic and state-resolved inelastic cross sections for cold and ultracold colli-
sions in the Rb(1S) + OH(2Π3/2) system, including ﬁne-structure and hyperﬁne eﬀects. We have
developed a new set of ﬁve potential energy surfaces for Rb-OH(2Π) from high-level ab initio elec-
tronic structure calculations, which exhibit conical intersections between covalent and ion-pair states.
The surfaces are transformed to a quasidiabatic representation. The collision problem is expanded in
a set of channels suitable for handling the system in the presence of electric and/or magnetic ﬁelds,
although we consider the zero-ﬁeld limit in this work. Because of the large number of scattering
channels involved, we propose and make use of suitable approximations. To account for the hyper-
ﬁne structure of both collision partners in the short-range region we develop a frame-transformation
procedure which includes most of the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian. Scattering cross sections on the order
of 10−13 cm2 are predicted for temperatures typical of Stark decelerators. We also conclude that
spin orientation of the partners is completely disrupted during the collision. Implications for both
sympathetic cooling of OH molecules in an environment of ultracold Rb atoms and experimental
observability of the collisions are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The possibility of producing translationally ultracold
molecules has recently generated great anticipation in the
ﬁeld of molecular dynamics. Attractive applications in-
clude the possibility of testing fundamental symmetries
[1], the potential of new phases of matter [2, 3, 4, 5] and
the renewed quest for the control of chemical reactions
through ultracold chemistry [6, 7, 8]. These endeavors
are beginning to bear scientiﬁc fruit. For example, high-
resolution spectroscopic measurements of translationally
cold samples of OH should allow improved astrophysical
tests of the variation with time of the ﬁne-structure con-
stant [9]. The recent experimental advances [10, 11, 12]
have made theoretical studies of the collisional behavior
of cold molecules essential [13, 14, 15], both to interpret
the data and to suggest future directions.

Several approaches have produced cold neutral
molecules to date, many of which are described in Ref.
11. The methods available can be classiﬁed into di-
rect methods, based on cooling of preexisting molecules,
and indirect methods, which create ultracold molecules
from ultracold atoms. Among the direct methods, Stark
deceleration of dipolar molecules in a supersonic beam
[16, 17, 18] and helium buﬀer-gas cooling [19] are cur-
rently leading the way. They reach temperatures of the
order of 10 mK, and there are a wide variety of pro-

posals on how to bridge the temperature gap to below
1 mK. These include evaporative cooling and even direct
laser cooling. The idea of sympathetic cooling, where a
hot species is cooled via collisions with a cold one, also
seems very attractive and is being pursued by several
experimental groups. Sympathetic cooling is a form of
collisional cooling, which works for multiple degrees of
freedom simultaneously. It does not rely on speciﬁc tran-
sitions, which makes if suitable for cooling molecules.
Collisional cooling is also the basis for helium buﬀer-gas
cooling.

Sympathetic cooling of trapped ions has already
been demonstrated [20], using a diﬀerent laser-cooled
ionic species as the refrigerant. Cooling of polyatomic
molecules to sub-kelvin temperatures with ions has also
been reported. This technique is expected to be suit-
able for cooling molecules of very high mass, including
those of biological relevance [21]. But the ease with which
alkali metal atoms can be cooled to ultracold tempera-
tures makes them good candidates to use as a thermal
reservoir to cool other species. They have already been
used to cool “more diﬃcult” atomic alkali metal partners.
For example, BEC for 41K was achieved by sympathetic
cooling of potassium atoms with Rb atoms [22]. A the-
oretical study of the viability of this cooling technique
for molecules is desirable. There have been a number
of theoretical studies of collisions of molecules with He
[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], in support of buﬀer-gas cooling,
but only a few with alkali metals [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. To
our knowledge, no such study has included the eﬀects of
hyperﬁne structure.

The main objective of the present work is to study cold
collisions of OH with trapped Rb atoms. OH has been

successfully slowed by Stark deceleration in at least two
laboratories [9, 34]. To cool the molecules further, sym-
pathetic cooling by thermal contact with 87Rb is an at-
tractive possibility. Rb is easily cooled and trapped in co-
pious quantities and can be considered the workhorse for
experiments on cold atoms. Temperatures below 100 µK
are reached even in a MOT environment (70 µK using
normal laser cooling and 7 µK using techniques such as
polarization gradient cooling).

The cooling and lifetime of species in the trap depends
largely on the ratio of elastic collision rates (which lead
to thermalization of the sample) to inelastic ones. The
latter can transfer molecules into non-trappable states
and/or release kinetic energy, with resultant heating and
trap loss. The characterization of the rates of both kinds
of process is thus required. Since applied electric and
magnetic ﬁelds oﬀer the possibility of controlling colli-
sions, it is very important to know the eﬀects of such
ﬁelds on the rates. At present, nothing is known about
the low-temperature collision cross sections of Rb-OH or
any similar system.

Rb-OH can be considered as a benchmark system for
the study of the feasibility of sympathetic cooling for
molecules. Many molecule-alkali metal atom systems
have deeply bound electronic states with ion-pair char-
acter [36, 37] and have collision rates that are enhanced
by a “harpooning” mechanism. Both the atom and the
diatom are open-shell doublet species, and can interact
on two triplet and three singlet potential energy surfaces
(PES). In addition, the OH radical has ﬁne structure,
including lambda-doubling, and both species possess nu-
clear spins and hence hyperﬁne structure. Thus Rb-OH is
considerably more complicated than other collision sys-
tems that have been studied at low temperatures.
In
previous work we advanced the ﬁrst estimates of cross
sections (for both inelastic and elastic collisions), based
on fully ab initio surfaces, for the collision of OH radicals
with Rb atoms in the absence of external ﬁelds [33]. Here
we provide details of the methodology used and discuss
the potential surfaces and the state-resolved partial cross
sections.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes
the calculation of ab initio PES for Rb-OH. Details of the
electronic structure calculations are given and the meth-
ods used for diabatization, interpolation and ﬁtting are
described. The general features of the resulting surfaces
are analyzed. Section III describes the exact and approx-
imate theoretical methodologies used for the dynamical
calculations. Section IV presents the resulting cross sec-
tions and discusses the possibility of sympathetic cooling.
We also comment on the role expected for the harpoon-
ing mechanism. Section 5 summarizes our results and de-
scribes prospects for future work. Further details about
electronic structure calculations and other channels basis
sets to describe the dynamics are given in Appendixes 1
and 2 respectively.

II. POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES

We have used ab initio electronic structure calculations
to obtain PES for interaction of OH(2Π) with Rb. The
ground X 2Π state of OH has a π3 conﬁguration, while
the ground 2S state of Rb has 5s1. At long range, linear
RbOH thus has 1Π and 3Π states. At nonlinear conﬁg-
urations, 1Π splits into 1A′ and 1A′′, with even and odd
reﬂection symmetry in the molecular plane, whereas 3Π
splits into 3A′ and 3A′′.

At shorter range, the situation is more complicated.
The ion-pair threshold Rb+ + OH− lies only 2.35 eV
above the neutral threshold. The corresponding 1Σ+
(1A′) ion-pair state drops very fast in energy with de-
creasing distance because of the Coulomb attraction. Be-
low, Jacobi coordinates (R, θ) will be used, R being the
radial distance between the atom and the OH center of
mass and θ the angle between this line and the inter-
nuclear axis. At the linear Rb-OH geometry, the ion-
pair state crosses the covalent (non-ion-pair) state near
R = 6.0 ˚A, as shown in Figure 1. At nonlinear geome-
tries, the ion-pair state has the same symmetry (1A′) as
one of the covalent states, so there is an avoided cross-
ing. There is thus a conical intersection between the two
1A′ states at linear geometries, which may have major
consequences for the scattering dynamics.

The 1A′ electronic wavefunctions near the conical in-
tersection are made up from two quite diﬀerent conﬁg-
urations, so that a multiconﬁguration electronic struc-
ture approach is essential to describe them. We have
therefore chosen to use MCSCF (multiconﬁguration self-
consistent ﬁeld) calculations followed by MRCI (multiref-
erence conﬁguration interaction) calculations to charac-
terize the surfaces. The electronic structure calculations
initially produce adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer) surfaces,
but these are unsuitable for dynamics calculations both
because they are diﬃcult to interpolate (with derivative
discontinuities at the conical intersections) and because
there are nonadiabatic couplings between them that be-
come inﬁnite at the conical intersections. We have there-
fore transformed the two 1A′ adiabatic surfaces that cross
into a diabatic representation, where there are non-zero
couplings between diﬀerent surfaces but both the poten-
tials and the couplings are smooth functions of coordi-
nates.

The electronic structure calculations are carried out
using the MOLPRO package [38].
It was necessary to
carry out an RHF (restricted Hartree-Fock) calculation
to provide initial orbital guesses before an MCSCF calcu-
lation. It is important that the Hartree-Fock calculation
gives good orbitals for both the OH π and Rb 5s orbitals
at all geometries (even those inside the crossing, where
the Rb 5s orbital is unoccupied in the ground state).
In addition, it is important that the OH π orbitals are
doubly occupied in the RHF calculations, as otherwise
they are non-degenerate at linear geometries at the RHF
level, and the MCSCF calculation is unable to recover
the degeneracy. To ensure this, we begin with an RHF

calculation on RbOH− rather than neutral RbOH.

For Rb, we use the small-core quasirelativistic eﬀective
core potential (ECP) ECP28MWB [39] with the valence
basis set from Ref. [40]. This treats the 4s, 4p and 5s elec-
trons explicitly, but uses a pseudopotential to represent
the core orbitals. For O and H, we use the aug-cc-pVTZ
correlation-consistent basis sets of Dunning [41] in un-
contracted form. Electronic structure calculations were
carried out at 275 geometries, constructed from all com-
binations of 25 intermolecular distances R and 11 angles θ
in Jacobi coordinates. The 25 distances were from 2.0 to
6.0 ˚A in steps of 0.25 ˚A, from 6.0 to 9.0 ˚A in steps of 0.5 ˚A
and from 9 ˚A to 12 ˚A in steps of 1 ˚A. The OH bond length
was ﬁxed at r = 0.9706 ˚A. The 11 angles were chosen to
be Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points [42], which give op-
timum quadratures to project out the Legendre compo-
nents of the potential while retaining points at the two
linear geometries. The linear points are essential to en-
sure that the A′ and A′′ surfaces are properly degenerate
if we used Gauss-Legendre points
at linear geometries:
instead, the values of the A′ and A′′ potentials at linear
geometries would depend on extrapolation from nonlin-
ear points and would be non-degenerate. The Gauss-
Lobatto points correspond approximately to θ = 0, 20.9,
38.3, 55.6, 72.8, 90, 107.2, 124.4, 141.7, 159.1 and 180◦,
where θ = 0 is to the linear Rb-HO geometry. The cal-
culations were in general carried out as angular scans at
each distance, since this avoided most convergence prob-
lems due to sudden changes in orbitals between geome-
tries.

A. Singlet states

We carried out a state-averaged MCSCF calculation of
the lowest 3 singlet states of neutral RbOH (two 1A′ and
one 1A′′). Molecular orbital basis sets will be described
using the notation (nA′ , nA′′ ), where the two integers in-
dicate the number of A′ and A′′ orbitals included. The
orbital energies are shown schematically in Figure 2. The
MCSCF basis set includes a complete active space (CAS)
constructed from the lowest (10,3) molecular orbitals,
with the lowest (5,1) orbitals closed (doubly occupied in
all conﬁgurations). The MCSCF calculation generates a
common set of orbitals for the 3 states. The calculations
were carried out in Cs symmetry, but at linear geome-
tries the two components of the Π states are degenerate
to within our precision (10−8 Eh).

For cold molecule collisions, it is very important to
have a good representation of the long-range forces.
These include a large contribution from dispersion (in-
termolecular correlation), so require a correlated treat-
ment. We therefore use the MCSCF orbitals in an MRCI
calculation, again of the lowest three electronic states.
The MOLPRO package implements the “internally con-
tracted” MRCI algorithm of Werner and Knowles [43].
The reference space in the MRCI is the same as the active
space for the MCSCF, and single and double excitations

are included from all orbitals except oxygen 1s. As de-
scribed in Appendix 1, the two 1A′ states are calculated
in a single MRCI block, so that they share a common
basis set.

We encountered diﬃculties with non-degeneracy be-
tween the two components of the 1Π states at linear ge-
ometries. These are described in Appendix 1. However,
using the basis sets and procedures described here, the
non-degeneracies were never greater than 90 µEh in the
2.25 ˚A (and consider-
total energies for distances R
ably less in the interaction energies around the linear
minimum).

B. Transforming to a diabatic representation

As described above, the two surfaces of 1A′ symmetry
cross at conical intersections at linear geometries. For
dynamical calculations, it is highly desirable to trans-
form the adiabatic states into diabatic states (or, strictly,

4

quasidiabatic states). MOLPRO contains code to carry
out diabatization by maximizing overlap between the dia-
batic states and those at a reference geometry. However,
this did not work for our application because we were
unable to ﬁnd reference states that had enough overlap
with the lowest adiabats at all geometries. We therefore
adopted a diﬀerent approach, based on matrix elements
of angular momentum operators. We use a Cartesian co-
ordinate system with the z axis along the OH bond. At
any linear geometry, the Π component of 1A′ symmetry
is uncontaminated by the ion-pair state, and the matrix
elements of ˆLz are

In the present work, we have taken the mixing angle to be
deﬁned by Eq. 4, using matrix elements of ˆLz calculated
between the MRCI wavefunctions. This gives a mixing
angle that, for linear geometries, is φ = 0 at long range
and φ = π/2 at short range (inside the crossing).

One complication that arises here is that the signs of
the three wavefunctions are arbitrary, and may change
discontinuously from one geometry to another. The signs
of the matrix elements obtained numerically by MOL-
PRO are thus completely arbitrary. It was therefore nec-
essary to pick a sign convention for the matrix elements
at linear geometries and adjust the signs at other geome-
tries to give a smoothly varying mixing angle.

It should be noted that this diabatization procedure is
not general, and will fail if there is any geometry where
both the numerator and the denominator of Eq. 4 are
small. Fortunately, this was not encountered for RbOH.
The sum of squares of the two matrix elements of ˆLz
was never less than 0.99 at distances from R = 3.0 ˚A
outwards, and never less than 0.7 even at R = 2.0 ˚A.

The mixing angles obtained for the singlet states of
RbOH are shown as a contour plot in Figure 3. As ex-
pected, φ changes very suddenly from 0 to 90◦ at lin-
ear and near-linear geometries, but smoothly at strongly
bent geometries.

The diabatization was carried out using total elec-
tronic energies (not interaction energies). The two sin-
glet diabatic PES that correlate with Rb(2S) + OH(2Π)
are shown in Figure 4, and the diabatic ion-pair surface
and the coupling potential are shown in Figure 5. Some
salient characteristics of the surfaces are given in Table I.
As required, the 1A′′ and 1A′ covalent states are degen-
erate at the two linear geometries, with a relatively deep
well (337 cm−1) at Rb-OH and a much shallower well at
Rb-HO. At bent geometries, it is notable that the poten-
tial well is broader and considerably deeper for the 1A′′
state than for the 1A′ state; indeed, the 1A′ state has a
linear minimum, while the 1A′′ has a bent minimum at
θ = 128◦ with a well depth of 405 cm−1. In spectroscopic
terms, this corresponds to a Renner-Teller eﬀect of type
1(b) in the classiﬁcation of Pople and Longuet-Higgins
[44].

The fact that the 1A′′ state is deeper than the 1A′ state
is somewhat unexpected, and will be discussed in more
detail in the context of the triplet surfaces below. The
fact that the surface for the covalent 1A′ state is slightly
repulsive between R = 4 and 9 ˚A and between θ = 40◦
and 150◦ is an artifact of the diabatization procedure

It is notable that the coupling potential is quite large,
peaking at 2578 cm−1 at R = 3.87 ˚A and θ = 83◦, and
is thus larger than the interaction energy for the two
covalent surfaces at most geometries. It may be seen from

C. Triplet states

The triplet states of RbOH are considerably simpler
than the singlet states, because there is no low-lying
triplet ion-pair state. There is thus no conical intersec-
tion, and diabatization is not needed.

Single-reference calculations would in principle be ade-
quate for the triplet states. Nevertheless, for consistency
with the singlet surfaces, we carried out MCSCF and
MRCI for the triplet surfaces as well. The (10,3) ac-
tive and reference spaces were speciﬁed as for the singlet
states, except that there is only one relevant 3A′ state and
the state average in the MCSCF calculation is therefore
over the lowest two states.

Contour plots of the 3A′ and 3A′′ surfaces are shown in
Figure 6. As for the singlet states, it is notable that the
3A′′ state lies below the 3A′ state at nonlinear geometries.
This ordering is diﬀerent from that found for systems
such as Ar-OH [46, 47] and He-OH [48]. In each case,
the A′ state corresponds to an atom approaching OH
in the plane of the unpaired electron, while the A′′ state
corresponds to an atom approaching OH out of the plane.
For He-OH and Ar-OH, the 2A′ state is deeper than the
2A′′ state simply because there is slightly less repulsion
due to a half-ﬁlled π orbital than due to a doubly ﬁlled
π orbital. Since these systems are dispersion-bound, and
the dispersion coeﬃcients are similar for the 2A′ and 2A′′
states, the slightly reduced repulsion for the 2A′ state
produces a larger well depth.

Rb-OH is quite diﬀerent. The long-range coeﬃcients
still provide a large part of the binding energy of the
covalent states, but the equilibrium distances (around 3.2
˚A, Table I) are about 1 ˚A shorter than would be expected
from the sum of the Van der Waals radii of Rb (2.44 ˚A)
and OH (1.78 ˚A, obtained from the Ar value of 1.88 ˚A
and the Ar-OH equilibrium distance of 3.67 ˚A [47]).

The qualitative explanation is that at nonlinear geome-
tries there is signiﬁcant overlap between the Rb 5s orbital
and the OH π orbital of a′ symmetry, forming weakly
bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals (MOs) for
the RbOH supermolecule. The eﬀect of this is shown in
Figure 7. In the A′ states, the bonding and antibonding
MOs are equally populated and there is no overall stabi-
lization. However, for the A′′ states the bonding MO is
doubly occupied and the antibonding MO is singly occu-
pied. This gives a signiﬁcant reduction in the repulsion
compared to a simple overlap-based model.

Even at linear Rb-OH geometries, the repulsion is re-

and should not be given physical signiﬁcance: the choice
of mixing angle (4) is an approximation, and a slightly
diﬀerent choice would give diﬀerent diabats and coupling
terms, but of course corresponding to the same adiabatic
surfaces.

The ion-pair state has a deep well at the RbOH geom-
etry and a rather shallower one at RbHO, as expected
from electrostatic considerations. The region around the

ing the counterpoise approach [49]. In addition, there are
Rb 5p orbitals that lie 1.87 eV above the ground state.
This is below the ion-pair energy at large R, so that a
(10,3) active space includes diﬀerent orbitals asymptot-
ically and at short range.
It is thus hard to calculate
asymptotic energies that are consistent with the short-
range energies directly. Nevertheless, for collision calcu-
lations we ultimately need interaction energies, relative
to the energy of free Rb(2S) + OH(2Π).

To circumvent this problem, we obtained angle-
dependent long-range coeﬃcients C6(θ) and C7(θ) for the
triplet states of RbOH and used these to extrapolate from
12 ˚A outwards at each angle. We carried out RCCSD cal-
culations (restricted coupled-cluster with single and dou-
ble excitations) on the 3A′ and 3A′′ states at all angles
at distances of 15, 25 and 100 ˚A. RCCSD was chosen in
preference to RCCSD(T) for greater consistency with the
MRCI calculations. Coupled cluster calculations are size-
extensive, so in this case the interaction energies V (R, θ)
for the 3A′ and 3A′′ states were calculated including the
counterpoise correction [49]. The interaction energy at
100 ˚A was found to be non-zero (about
1.38 µEh), but
was the same to within 10−9 Eh for both 3A′ and 3A′′
states and at all angles. For each pair of angles θ and

Interpolation and ﬁtting

The procedures described above produce six potential
energy surfaces on a two-dimensional grid of geometries
four surfaces corresponding to covalent states
(R, θ):
(“c”), with A′ or A′′ symmetry and triplet or singlet
multiplicity, one surface with ion-pair character with 1A′
symmetry, and ﬁnally the non-vanishing coupling of this
latter state with the covalent 1A′ state. We will denote

follows that of Meuwly and Hutson [50] and Sold´an et
al. [51]. The interpolation was carried out ﬁrst in R (for
each surface and angular point) and then in θ. The in-
terpolation in R used the RP-RKHS (reciprocal power
reproducing kernel Hilbert space) procedure [35] with pa-
rameters m = 5 and n = 3. This gives a potential with
long-range form

The value of β was chosen by ﬁtting the values of the
coupling potential at R = 10 and 12 ˚A to decaying expo-

and q = 0 for the sum and ion-pair potentials, 2 for the

can thus be used as a label to distinguish the diﬀerent po-
tentials. The coeﬃcients Vkq(R) for k = q to 9 were pro-

Since there are fewer coeﬃcients than points, the result-
ing potential function does not pass exactly through the
potential points. However, the error for the covalent
states in the well region is no more than 20 µEh.

We thus arrive at a set of R-dependent coeﬃcients
V α,2S+1
(R), with α = c, i or ic labeling the potentials
kq
for the pure covalent or ion-pair states or the coupling
between them and 2S + 1 = 0 or 1 for singlet or triplet
states respectively. These coeﬃcients will be used be-
low in evaluating the electronic potential matrix elements
which couple collision channels in the dynamical calcula-
tions.

III. DYNAMICAL METHODOLOGY

A. The basis sets

We carry out coupled-channel calculations of the col-
lision dynamics. The channels are labeled by quantum
numbers that characterize the internal states of the col-
liding partners, plus partial wave quantum numbers that
deﬁne the way the partners approach each other.

It is convenient to distinguish between the laboratory
frame, whose z axis is taken to be along the direction of
the external ﬁeld (if any) and the molecule frame, whose
z axis lies along the internuclear axis of the OH molecule
and whose xz plane contains the triatomic system. This
allows us to deﬁne external coordinates that ﬁx the col-
lision plane, and internal coordinates that describe the
relative position of the components on it. As external co-
ordinates, we choose the Euler angles (α, β, γ) required to
change from the laboratory frame to the molecule-frame;
as internal coordinates we use the system of Jacobi coor-
dinates (R, θ) deﬁned above. We also deﬁne the spherical
angles (θ′, φ′) that describe the orientation of the inter-
molecular axis in the external (laboratory) frame.

We ﬁrst focus on the covalent channels OH(π3, 2Π) +
Rb(5s1, 2S1/2). The OH molecule can be described us-
ing Hund’s case (a) quantum numbers: the internal state
is expressed in a basis set given by
, where
i
sd is the electronic spin of OH and σ its projection on
the internuclear axis; λ is the projection of the electronic
orbital angular momentum onto the internuclear axis; j
is the angular momentum resulting from the electronic
and rotational degrees of freedom, m its projection on
the laboratory axis and ω = λ + σ its projection on the
internuclear axis. The symmetric top wavefunctions that
describe the rotation of the diatom in space are deﬁned by
jmω
mω(α, β, γ). At this stage λ, σ and ω
|
are still signed quantities. However, in zero electric ﬁeld,
energy eigenstates of OH are also eigenstates of parity,
labeled ǫ = e or f . These labels refer to “+“or “
” sign
ω; the real parity
taken in the combination of ω and
1)j−sd. To include parity, we can deﬁne
is given by ǫ(

values of a signed quantity. Finally, we need to include
also the nuclear spin degree of freedom: if id designates
the nuclear spin angular momentum of the diatom, then j
and id combine to form fd, the total angular momentum
of the diatom, which has projection mfd on the labora-
tory z axis. The resulting basis set that describes the

For Rb, the electronic angular momentum is given en-
tirely by the spin sa of the open-shell electron, which
combines with the nuclear spin ia to form fa, the total
angular momentum of the atom. The state of the Rb
atom can then be expressed as

.
(saia)famfai
|
The explicit inclusion of the sd and sa quantum numbers
allows us to use the same notation for ion-pair channels
OH−(π4, 1Σ+) + Rb+(1S0):
in this case both partners
are closed-shell, so sd = sa = ¯λ = ¯ω = 0 and ǫ = +1.

(24)

The resulting basis set for close-coupling calculations

on the complete system (designated B1) has the form

The scattering Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in total
angular momentum and total parity. The total parity is
well deﬁned in the basis set we have selected, and given
1)j−sd+L. It is conserved in the presence of a
by p = ǫ(
magnetic ﬁeld but not an electric ﬁeld. The total angular
momentum is not conserved in the presence of either a
magnetic or an electric ﬁeld. However, the projection of
total angular momentum on the laboratory z axis, given
by MJ = mfd + mfa + ML, is conserved in the presence
of an external ﬁeld aligned with the laboratory z axis.

B. Matrix elements of the potential energy

The PES in section II are diagonal in the total elec-
tronic spin, S, and in the states of the nuclei, mia and
mid, with mia and mid the nuclear spin projections of the
atom and diatom in the laboratory frame. We therefore
ﬁnd it convenient to deﬁne basis sets labeled by these
quantum numbers. This allows not only the direct calcu-
lation of potential matrix elements, but the deﬁnition of
some useful frame transformations [61]. Two other basis
sets, B2 and B3, deﬁned with/without parity (B2p/B2w
and B3p/B3w) are described in Appendix 2. The cor-
responding frame transformations are deﬁned in section
III C.

The calculation of the matrix elements of the potential
energy is most direct in basis set B2w. This is based on
Hund’s case (b) quantum numbers for the molecule, and
is given by

In order to relate the PES obtained in section II to
the quantum numbers of our channels, it is convenient to
recast the electronic wavefunctions for the covalent states
of 2S+1A′ and 2S+1A′′ in terms of functions with deﬁnite
values of λ,

−

λ.
The B2w basis functions do not explicitly depend on θ.
We therefore rotate the Θkq functions [55] onto the labo-
ratory frame, to which molecular spins and partial waves
are ultimately referred. The functions Θkq are propor-
tional to renormalized spherical harmonics Ckq(θ, 0) [55],
for which

The potential matrix elements in basis sets B2p and B3p
are trivially related to the ones in B2w and B3w, respec-
tively, requiring only the change to a parity-symmetrized

by taking the standard composition of j and sa with the

IV (C1 and C2) are indicated. Hyperﬁne splitting in Rb and
Λ-doubling and hyperﬁne splitting in OH are given.

The true eigenstates of OH are linear combinations
of functions with diﬀerent values of ω, mixed by spin-
uncoupling terms in the hamiltonian. The mixing is
signiﬁcant even for the rotational ground state: 85% of
ω = 3/2 and 15% of ω = 1/2. We have approximated OH
as a pure case (a) molecule for convenience in the present
work. The ﬁne and hyperﬁne energies, taken from the
work of Coxon et al.
[56], were associated to a unique

Rb, the experimental values are taken from ref. 57. Fig-

where µ is the reduced mass, ˆV (R) indicates the poten-

stant thresholds matrix. By construction, any constant
diﬀerence of energy between channels has been relegated
to the threshold matrix so that the potential matrix ele-
ments die oﬀ at long range.

The coupled-channel equations that result from intro-
ducing this Hamiltonian into the total Schr¨odinger equa-
tion are propagated using the log-derivative method of

Johnson [59], modiﬁed to take variable step sizes keyed
to the local de Broglie wavelength. The log-derivative
matrix Y thus obtained is matched to spherical Bessel
functions in the usual way to yield the scattering ma-
trix S. Using T matrix elements (T = i(S

(sd¯λ¯ωǫ(jid)fdmfd, (saia)famfa ), and k = (2µE/~2)1/2 is
the wave number corresponding to incident kinetic en-
ergy E.

Our aim is to extract information for collisional pro-
cesses involving OH(j = 3/2,2 Π3/2) + Rb(5s1, 2S1/2), in
any of their hyperﬁne states, with translational energies
in the range 10−6 to 1 K. This range comfortably includes
both the temperatures currently reached in buﬀer-gas or
Stark deceleration experiments and the target tempera-
tures of sympathetic cooling. A fully converged calcula-
tion would require propagation to large values of R and
the inclusion of a huge number of channels. Although
both covalent and ion-pair channels should be consid-
ered, in this pilot study we include only covalent states,
except in Section IV C below. The large anisotropy of the
surfaces included in the calculation makes it necessary to
use a large number of OH rotational states and partial
waves; the inclusion of rotational states up to j = 11/2
550 cm−1 (¯ω = 3/2) and
is required (these states lie
≈
850 cm−1 (¯ω = 1/2) above the ground state, numbers
≈
comparable to the depth of the covalent potential energy
surfaces). The number of partial waves needed for con-
vergence for each rotational state is shown in Table III;
it may be seen that fewer partial waves are required for
higher rotational states. Unfortunately, a fully converged
calculation was beyond our computational resources, so
we reduced the number of channels to include only 40%
of those in Table III. This gives cross sections accurate
to within a factor of 2.

We consider ﬁrst the collision of atoms and molecules
that are both in their maximally stretched states,
(fa, mfa) = (fd, mfd) = (2, +2). The s-wave incident

channel has L = 0 and ML = 0, so corresponds to
MJ = +4. The set of all MJ = +4 channels with a
deﬁned total parity p, including all allowed ML projec-
tions, as well as all the fa, fd, mfa and mfd quantum
numbers (or equivalently m, msa and mia , mid ) contains
23433 channels. This makes an exact calculation infeasi-
ble. We have therefore introduced two approximations to
reduce this number. First, the projection mfd for chan-
nels with j > 5/2 is ﬁxed to its initial value; the sup-
pressed projections increase the degeneracy and might
split rotational Feshbach resonances, but numerical tests
show that making this approximation does not substan-
tially alter the overall magnitude of the cross sections
reported here. This approximation reduces the number
of channels to 10555. Second, for propagation at large R
we disregard channels that are “locally closed”, that is,
whose centrifugal barrier is higher than the incident en-
ergy in a given amount that is modiﬁed until converence.
Even with these approximations, and the suppression
of ion-pair channels, it is impractical to perform full cal-
culations. However, dividing the radial solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation into an inner region (R < R0) and
an outer region (R > R0) makes it possible to use diﬀer-

12

ent basis sets (“frames”) in each of them. Frame transfor-
mations have previously been employed for the simpler
problem of alkaline earth+alkaline earth collisions [62]
and for electron-molecule collisions [61]. They will be
an essential tool for introducing hyperﬁne structure into
atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collision problems
[63]. The calculation is thus divided into two diﬀerent
steps:

•

At short range, R < R0, the hyperﬁne interac-
tion is small compared to the depths of the short-
range potentials. We therefore represent the Hamil-
tonian in basis set B3 (see Appendix 2), where
the potential is diagonal in nuclear spin projec-
tions mia and mid. There are 8 such blocks (since
(2id + 1)(2ia + 1) = 8). We ignore elements of ˆHth
that couple diﬀerent pairs of mia and mid. This re-

This Y matrix is then transformed into the asymp-
totic basis set B1. We have found that this frame
transform provides a very accurate way to include
the Rb-OH hyperﬁne structure in reduced calcula-
tions using only covalent channels. Moreover, ow-
ing to the depth of the short-range potentials, Y
is weakly dependent on energy and can be interpo-
lated in the inner region.

•

At long range, R > R0, the Y matrix, expressed
already in B1,
is propagated to large distances
to obtain the S matrix. We invoke an alterna-
tive approximation: The coupling between diﬀerent
asymptotic rotational and ﬁne-structure states di-
minishes at longer distances and can be neglected.
Thus the subset corresponding to the ground rota-
tional diatomic state (j = 3/2, ¯ω = 3/2) can be
propagated by itself to asymptotic distances. We
reinstate the full hyperﬁne Hamiltonian in this re-
gion.

It is worth noting that basis set B2, deﬁned in Ap-
pendix 2, could also be the basis for another frame trans-
formation. Approximate decoupling of singlet and triplet
channels in the inner region would allow a partition of the
numerical eﬀort into two smaller groups of channels, and

the introduction of the ionic channels in the singlet one.

IV. SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS

We have calculated elastic and state-resolved inelastic
cross sections for two diﬀerent incident channels for col-
lisions of Rb atoms with OH molecules. These are shown
as C1 and C2 in Figure 8. Although we do not include
the eﬀects of external ﬁelds explicitly in this work, we
consider states in which both partners can be in weak-
ﬁeld-seeking states in a magnetic ﬁeld, and thus magnet-
ically trappable. The OH hyperﬁne states that can be
trapped at laboratory magnetic ﬁelds are (fd = 2, mfd =
+2, +1, 0) and (fd = 1, mfd = +1), while the correspond-
ing states for Rb are (fa = 2, mfa = +2, +1, 0); the Rb
state (fa = 1, mfa =
1) is trappable for ﬁelds smaller
that

1250 gauss.

−

In the ﬁrst case, designated C1 in Figure 8, both part-
ners are in maximally stretched states: OH(ǫ = f, fd =
2, mfd = 2) + Rb(fa = 2, mfa = 2). This case corre-
sponds to the highest threshold correlating with OH in
its ground rotational state. In this case, OH is also elec-
trostatically trappable. The second case, designated C2
in Figure 8, correlates with the lowest asymptotic thresh-
old in the absence of an external ﬁeld: OH(ǫ = e, fd =

FIG. 9: Adiabatic curves correlating with the lower rotational
states for the collision in maximally stretched states of both
partners (p = +1, MJ = +4): for R < 17 a0 hyperﬁne inter-
action is partially neglected; for long range R > 17 a0, only
channels with OH in its ground rotational state are consid-
ered and full hyperﬁne is included (inset gives a more detailed
image of the latter regime).

Figure 9 shows selected adiabatic curves correlating
with the lower rotational states for the collision with both
partners in maximally stretched states (p = +1, MJ =
+4).
In our calculations we take R0 = 17 a0. As de-
scribed above, for R < R0 the hyperﬁne interaction is
partially neglected. For R > R0, only hyperﬁne channels
with OH in its ground rotational state are included.

A. General behavior: total cross sections

We begin by showing in Figure 10 the total cross sec-
tions for incident channels C1 and C2. A brief description
of these has been reported previously [33]. Below 10−4 K
for incident channel C1, or 10−5 K for C2, the Wigner
threshold law applies. Namely, as the energy goes to
zero, cross sections corresponding to elastic and isoen-
ergetic processes approach a constant value, while those
for exoergic processes vary as 1/√E, rapidly exceeding
elastic cross sections. No quantitative predictive power is

13

expected in this region. Rather, the values of threshold
cross sections are strongly subject to details of the PES,
and are typically only uncovered by experiments.

At higher energies, above 10−2 K, where many par-
tial waves contribute (l
5 for C2),
the behavior of the cross sections changes and inelastic
processes are well described by a semiclassical Langevin
capture model [33, 36],

(cid:19)

This cross section is also plotted in Figure 10 (points).
The Langevin expression arises as a limit of the exact
quantum expression in Eq. 32, with the usual assump-
tions: the impact parameter takes values in a continu-
ous range, and the height of the centrifugal barrier, de-
termined using only long-range behavior, determines the
number of partial waves that contribute for a given en-
ergy. Similar behavior has been observed previously in
cold collisions, such as M + M2 with M an alkali metal.
For Li + Li2, l > 3 was found to be a suﬃcient for the
cross sections to exhibit Langevin behavior [30].

As can be seen in Figure 10, the Langevin limit re-
produces the general trend across the entire semiclassi-
cal energy range. In a Hund’s case (a) system like OH,
where the electron spin is strongly tied to the intermolec-
ular axis, the highly anisotropic PES might be expected
to disrupt the spin orientation relative to the laboratory
frame completely. As a consequence, inelastic processes
are expected to be very likely and the Langevin model
should describe well the behavior of Rb-OH and similar
systems. A similar upper limit for the elastic cross sec-
tion is given by four times the inelastic one. It is easy to
verify that, if the inelastic cross section reaches its maxi-
mum value, the elastic and inelastic contributions to the
cross section must be equal. This behavior is also seen
in Figure 10.

The cross sections for incident channel C2 are quite
diﬀerent from those for incident channel C1. For C2, the
cross sections are highly structured, exhibiting a large
number of Feshbach resonances. Since the atom and the
diatom are both in their lowest-energy state, there are
plenty of higher-lying hyperﬁne states to resonate with.
However, the pronounced minimum in the elastic cross
10−4 K is the consequence of a near-zero
section at E
s-wave phase shift.

∼

B. Detailed picture: partial cross sections

Some additional insight into the collision process can
be obtained by examining the partial cross sections to
various ﬁnal states. However, there are many of these.
Starting in incident channel C1, there are 128 possible
outcomes, counting the hyperﬁne states of both Rb and

FIG. 10: Elastic and total inelastic cross sections for the cases

OH, plus the lambda doublet of OH. To simplify this
information, we ﬁrst break the cross sections into four
classes: elastic scattering, scattering in which only the
Rb state changes, scattering in which only the OH state
changes, and scattering in which both change.

These four possibilities are shown in Figure 11 for both
incident channels, C1 and C2. In general, all four pro-
cesses are likely to occur. This further attests to the
complete disruption of the spin during a collision. Nev-
ertheless, at the highest energies probed (where results
are less sensitive to potential details) there is a deﬁnite
propensity for the OH molecule to change its internal
state more readily than the Rb atom, at least when only
one of them changes. This is probably a consequence of
the spherical symmetry of the Rb atom, whereby its elec-
tronic spin is indiﬀerent to its orientation. By contrast,
the electronic angular momentum of OH is strongly cou-
pled to the molecular axis, and will follow its changes in
orientation due to the anisotropies in the interaction.

A more detailed understanding can be obtained by

FIG. 11: Total cross sections for 4 types of process are con-
sidered: those where only OH partner changes internal state,
those where only Rb changes, those where both partners suf-
fer inelastic change and those where neither change. Panel
(a) corresponds to OH(ǫ = f, fd = 2, mfd = 2) + Rb(fa =
2, mfa = 2) incident channel (C1). Panel (b) corresponds to
OH(ǫ = e, fd = 1, mfd = 1) + Rb(fa = 1, mfa = −1) incident

considering Eq. 30. For Rb the hyperﬁne projection is
given by mfa = msa + mia , whereas for OH it is given
by mfd = mn + msd + mid . The nuclear spin projec-
tions mia and mid are untouched by potential energy
couplings. The potential conserves MS = msa + msd , so
that if the Rb electronic spin msa changes, so will the
OH electronic spin msd. On the other hand, OH can also
change the projection mn of the rotational angular mo-
mentum n, which is absent in Rb. Thus OH has more
opportunities to change its internal state than does Rb,
and this is reﬂected in the propensities in Figure 11.

We ﬁrst consider incident channel C1, with both colli-
sion partners initially in their maximally stretched states.
Some of the main outcomes are shown in Fig 12. In the
absence of an anisotropic interaction, and remembering
that MJ = mfa + mfd + ML is conserved, the sum of the
spin projections MF = mfa + mfd would be conserved.
Thus inelastic collisions would be impossible. This is be-

cause the projection of mfd could not be lowered without
raising mfa, but mfa could not be raised further. How-
ever, the anisotropic PES in Rb-OH allows such changes
quite readily.

There remains, however, a propensity for collisions
with small values of ∆mf to be more likely, as seen in
Figure 13. Part (a) shows cross sections that change
mfd for OH without changing mfa for Rb, while part (b)
shows those that change mfa without changing mfd . As
noted above, Rb appears to be more reluctant to change
its projection.
In fact, since the potential is diagonal
in the states of the nuclei, only consecutive values of
mfa are coupled in ﬁrst order. On the other hand, ﬁrst-
order coupling exists between many diﬀerent values of
mfd. Finally, a decrease in the probability of processes
with increasing ∆MF can be related to the diminution
of anisotropic terms in the potential when increasing the
angular momentum transfer (k in Eq. 30).

We now consider incident channel C2, OH(ǫ = e, fd =

tial channel, the processes can occur by ordinary spin ex-
change with no centrifugal barrier. Partial cross sections
for these three channels are shown in Figure 14 (a) over
the entire energy range.
Intriguingly, inelastic (state-
changing) collisions seem to be somewhat suppressed
relative to elastic scattering. Suppressed spin-exchange
rates would presumably require delicate cancellation be-
tween singlet and triplet phase shifts [73]. That such a
cancellation occurs in a highly multichannel process is
somewhat unexpected. However, examining the matrix

Many other exit channels are possible, once energy and
angular momentum considerations permit them. Cross
sections for several such processes are shown in Figure
14 (b). For example, the channels OH(ǫ = e, 1, 0) +
1) are not con-
Rb(1, +1) and OH(ǫ = e, 1, 0) + Rb(1,
nected to the initial channel by spin exchange, since MF
changes by
1. In this case, angular momentum shunts
from the molecule into the partial-wave degree of free-
dom, necessitating an L = 1 partial wave in the exit
channel. Therefore, this process is suppressed for ener-
gies below the p-wave centrifugal barrier, whose height is
1.6 mK.

We conclude this subsection by stressing the vital im-

threshold. Only after both channels are open, at higher
energies, do the cross sections become almost identical.

portance of including the hyperﬁne structure in these
calculations. Figure 15 shows partial cross sections
for incident channel C1 scattering into pairs of chan-
nels which diﬀer only in the small hyperﬁne splitting
of OH (
3 mK). In one example (black and red solid
curves), the parity of OH changes from f to e, leading
to the ﬁnal channels OH(ǫ = e, fd = 1, 2, mfd = 0) +
Rb(fa = 2, mfa = 0). These channels, distinguished only
by their hyperﬁne quantum number fd, are almost iden-
tical at high energies, but quite diﬀerent at low ener-
gies. As a second example, consider the ﬁnal channels
OH(ǫ = f, fd = 1, 2, mfd = 0) + Rb(fa = 2, mfa = +2),
(green and orange dashed), which preserve the initial par-
ity. The process with fd = 1 is exothermic, while the one
with fd = 2 requires the opening of the partial wave

FIG. 15: Partial cross sections for two pairs of processes corre-
sponding to incident channel C1 (OH(ǫ = f, fd = 2, mfd = 2)

the fd quantum number. Their values converge at high kinetic
energies but are very diﬀerent in the cold regime.

C. The harpooning process

We have not yet fully incorporated the ion-pair chan-
nel in our calculations, but it is instructive to assess its
inﬂuence. In the harpooning model it is usually under-
stood that, if the electron transfer takes place at long
range, large collision cross sections result [64]. However,
6 ˚A gives a geometric
for Rb-OH the crossing point R0 ≈
10−14 cm2. This is
cross section of only σ = 4πR2
4.5
0 ≈
substantially smaller than the quantum-mechanical cross
sections we have estimated. Thus while harpooning may
enhance cross sections substantially at thermal energies,
it is likely to have less overall inﬂuence in cold collisions.
The inelastic results above place cross sections near
the semiclassical Langevin upper limit. The harpooning
mechanism is unlikely to increase their magnitude, but
could change their details. For example, it might be ex-
pected that the harpooning mechanism would distribute
the total probability more evenly among the diﬀerent spin
orientations.

We have explored the inﬂuence of the harpooning
mechanism in a reduced calculation where the hyper-
ﬁne structure is neglected. This makes the calcula-
tion tractable even with the ion-pair channel included.
The resulting elastic and total inelastic cross sections,
for incident channel OH(ǫ = f, j = 3/2, m = 3/2) +
Rb(sa = 1/2, msa = 1/2) (maximally stretched in the
absence of nuclear degrees of freedom) are shown in Fig-

ure 16. They are compared to the results obtained with-
out the ion-pair channels.
In the semiclassical region,
E > 1 mK, the general order of magnitude of the cross
sections is preserved, although the detailed features are
not.
In the Wigner regime, by contrast, including the
ion-pair channel makes a quite signiﬁcant change, be-
cause completely diﬀerent phase shifts are generated in
low-lying partial waves. We stress again, however, that
we do not expect this or any model to have predictive
power for the values of low-energy cross sections until the
ambiguities in absolute scattering lengths are resolved by
experiments.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

Based on the results above, we can draw several general
conclusions concerning both the feasibility of observing
Rb-OH collisions experimentally in a beam experiment
and the possibility of sympathetic cooling of OH using
ultracold Rb.

We can assert with some conﬁdence that Rb-OH cross
sections at energies of tens of mK, typical of Stark de-
celerators, will be on the order of 10−13 cm2. This is
probably large enough to make the collisions observable.
In round numbers, consider a Rb MOT with density
nRb = 1010 cm−3, and an OH packet emerging from a
Stark decelerator at 10 m/s, with density nOH = 107
cm−3. Further assume that the Rb is stored in an elon-
gated MOT that allows an interaction distance of 1 cm
as the OH passes through. In this case, a cross section
σ = 10−13 cm2 implies that approximately 10−3 of the
OH molecules are scattered out of the packet. This quan-
tity, while small, should be observable in repeated shots

17

of the experiment [65].

As for sympathetic cooling OH using cold Rb, it seems
unlikely that this will be possible for species in their
stretched states as in channel C1. The inelastic rates are
almost always comparable to, or greater than, the elastic
rates. The situation becomes even worse as the tem-
perature drops and cross sections for exoergic processes
diverge. Every collision event might serve to thermalize
the OH gas, but is equally likely to remove the molecule
from the trap altogether, or contribute to heating the
gas.

For collision partners in the low-energy states of inci-
dent channel C2, the situation is not as bleak, at least
in the low-energy limit, since inelastic cross sections do
not diverge and may be fairly small. However, we have
focused on the weak-magnetic-ﬁeld seeking state of OH,
which will not be the lowest-energy state in a magnetic
ﬁeld. Thus exoergic processes again appear, and inelas-
tic rates will again become unacceptably large. Under
these circumstances, rather than “sympathetic cooling,”
the gas would exhibit “simply pathetic cooling.”

From these considerations, it seems that the only way
to guarantee inelastic rates suﬃciently low to aﬀord sym-
pathetic cooling would be to remove all exoergic inelas-
tic channels altogether. Thus both species, atom and
molecule, should be trapped in their absolute ground
states, using optical or microwave dipole traps [66] or
possibly an alternating current trap [67]. Sympathetic
cooling would then be forced due to the absence of any
possible outcome other than elastic and endoergic pro-
cesses. The latter might produce a certain population of
hyperﬁne-excited OH molecules, which could then give
up their internal energy again and contribute towards
heating. However, the molecules are far more likely to
collide with atoms than with other molecules, so that
this energy would eventually be carried away as the Rb
is cooled.

Further aspects of the Rb-OH collision problem need
further work. Foremost among these is the possibility
that inelastic rates could be reduced or controlled by
applying electric and/or magnetic ﬁelds. This may re-
sult partly from the simple act of moving Feshbach res-
onances to diﬀerent energies, or from altering the eﬀec-
tive coupling between incident and ﬁnal channels, as has
been hinted at previously [13, 68]. In addition, the inﬂu-
ence of the ion-pair channel may be signiﬁcant. There is
the possibility, for example, that the highly polar RbOH
molecule might be produced by absorption followed by
either spontaneous or stimulated emission [37]. Finally,
new phenomena are possible, such as analogues of the
ﬁeld-linked states that have been predicted in dipole-
dipole collisions [69, 70].

Appendix 1

As described above, we encountered diﬃculties with
non-degeneracies between the 1A′ and 1A′′ components of
the 1Π state at linear geometries. These could have been
avoided by carrying out the linear calculations in C2v
rather than Cs symmetry, but Cs symmetry was essential
to avoid discontinuities at θ = 0 and 180◦.

To understand the non-degeneracies it is essential to
understand the procedure used to generate the basis set
used in the CISD calculation.

1. The molecular orbital basis set is partitioned into
internal and external sets, and the internal orbitals
are in turn partitioned into closed and active sets.

2. A reference space is generated, including all pos-
sible arrangements of the N available electrons
among the active orbitals that give states of the
speciﬁed symmetry and spin multiplicity. The
closed orbitals are doubly occupied in all reference
conﬁgurations.

3. A set of (N –2)-electron states is generated by all
possible 2-electron annihilations from the reference
states (with no symmetry constraints). Some of
the closed orbitals may be designated as core or-
bitals, in which case annihilations from them are
not included.

4. A set of (N –1)-electron states is generated by all
possible 1-electron additions to internal orbitals of
the (N –2)-electron states (with no symmetry con-
straints).

5. The ﬁnal CI basis includes states of 3 diﬀerent

classes:

•

•

•

Internal states are generated by all possi-
ble 1-electron additions to the (N –1)-electron
states, with the extra electron in an internal
orbital, that give states of the speciﬁed sym-
metry and spin multiplicity;

Singly external states are generated by all
possible 1-electron additions to the (N –1)-
electron states, with the extra electron in an
external orbital, that give states of the speci-
ﬁed symmetry and spin multiplicity;

Internally contracted doubly external states
are generated by 2-electron excitations into
the external space from a reference function
obtained by solving a small CI problem in the
reference space.

The non-degeneracies between the 1A′ and 1A′′ com-
ponents of the 1Π state arise from two diﬀerent sources.

18

First, there is a part of the non-degeneracy due to the
internal and singly external conﬁgurations. At linear ge-
ometries there are both Σ-type and Π-type reference con-
ﬁgurations. Both types are included for A′ symmetry,
but only the Π-type reference conﬁgurations are included
for A′′ symmetry. In the A′ calculation, therefore, there
are additional Π-type internal and singly external conﬁg-
urations that arise from Σ-type reference conﬁgurations.
This eﬀect could in principle be suppressed in MOLPRO
by including reference conﬁgurations of both symmetries
in both calculations at all geometries, but this was pro-
In addition, as
hibitively expensive in computer time.
described below, it is responsible for only about 20% of
the total non-degeneracy.

Secondly, there is a part of the non-degeneracy due to
the (contracted) doubly external conﬁgurations. It must
be remembered that we wish to transform the 1A′ and
2A′ singlet states into a diabatic representation. To do
this meaningfully, we need them to be calculated using
identical basis sets. If we do the MRCI calculations sep-
arately, this is not true: even if the reference space is
the same, each state produces a diﬀerent set of internally
contracted doubly external states. It is thus necessary to
calculate the two 1A′ states in the same MRCI block, so
that the basis set contains both sets of contracted func-
tions. However, this results in a larger and more ﬂexible
basis set of contracted doubly external functions than is
generated in the 1A′′ case.

It is helpful to document the magnitude of the non-
degeneracies in various possible calculations. For RbOH
at θ = 0 and R = 12 ˚A:

•

•

•

•

•

If calculations are carried out in C2v symmetry, the
ion-pair and covalent states have diﬀerent symme-
try and the non-degeneracy is not present;

For Cs symmetry with the two 1A′ states calcu-
lated in a single MRCI block, both sources of non-
degeneracy are present and the non-degeneracy is
22.78 µEh;

For Cs symmetry with the two 1A′ states calculated
in separate MRCI blocks, only the ﬁrst source of
non-degeneracy is present and the non-degeneracy
is 4.08 µEh;

For Cs symmetry with the two 1A′ states calcu-
lated in a single MRCI block, but reference con-
ﬁgurations of both symmetries included, only the
second source of non-degeneracy is present and the
non-degeneracy is 18.70 µEh;

For Cs symmetry with the two 1A′ states calcu-
lated in separate MRCI blocks, with reference con-
ﬁgurations of both symmetries included, there is no
non-degeneracy.

Appendix 2

The interaction potential does not involve the spins of
the nuclei and is diagonal in the total electronic spin S.
This makes it expedient to deﬁne two additional basis
sets.

Basis set B2 is based on Hund’s case (b) quantum num-
bers for the molecule: the orbital angular momentum of
the electron and the rotational angular momentum cou-
ple to form n, with λ projection on the internuclear axis.
n coupled to the spin of the electron sd would give us j
for the diatomic fragment, as in basis set B1. Instead, in
B2 we couple sd with sa to obtain the total spin of the
electrons, described by kets
. However, we leave
SMSi

aside the states of the nuclei, which are represented by

ratory frame. Basis set B2w is then given by

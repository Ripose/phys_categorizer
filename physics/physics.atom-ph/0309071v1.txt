Abstract Large amounts of hyperpolarized 3He gas
with high nuclear polarization rates are required for use
in neutron spin ﬁlters or nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging of human lung. Very high eﬃciency can be ob-
tained by metastability exchange optical pumping us-
ing multimode lasers to excite the 23S-23P transition
at 1083 nm. Broadband Ytterbium-doped tunable ﬁber
lasers have been designed for that particular application.
Diﬀerent options for the architecture of the ﬁber oscilla-
tor are presented and compared. Emphasis is given to a
linear cavity conﬁguration that includes a high reﬂectiv-
ity ﬁber mirror and a low reﬂectivity tunable ﬁber Bragg
grating. Optical measurements are performed to ﬁnely
characterize the spectral behavior of the lasers. Atomic
response is also quantitatively probed to assess the opti-
mal design of the oscillator for optical pumping. Multi-
mode operation matching the 2 GHz Doppler-broadened
helium resonance line and tunability over more than
200 GHz are demonstrated. Boosting the output of this
ﬁber laser with a Yb-doped ﬁber power ampliﬁer, all-
ﬁber devices are built to provide robust, high power
turn-key sources at 1083 nm for improved production
of laser polarized 3He.

1 Introduction

Laser-polarized 3He is used in a variety of research ﬁelds,
ranging from low temperature to nuclear physics [1,2,3].
It has emerged in the past decade as a very promising
tool for applications like the preparation of spin ﬁlters

ciated to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque
(UMR 8552)

for cold neutrons [2,4], or magnetic resonance imaging
of air spaces in human lungs [5,6,7]. This has strongly
increased the demand for production of large amounts of
gas with very high nuclear polarizations and high pro-
duction rates. The most eﬃcient method to meet both
requirements is metastability exchange optical pumping
(MEOP). It relies on optical pumping (OP) of the 23S
metastable state of helium with 1083 nm resonant light
[8,9]. Large nuclear polarizations can be prepared in a
low pressure gas at room temperature within a few sec-
onds [9,10]. Polarization-preserving compression is per-
formed after OP to obtain dense gas, with a choice of
possible schemes depending on the targeted application
[11,12,13]. Home-built 1083 nm light sources [1,14] are
now replaced by commercial lasers [10,15,16,17]. Their
development may lead to improved performances and
open the way to a wider dissemination of this laser-based
polarization technique.

For massive production of highly polarized 3He gas
powerful ampliﬁers have been built, a progress due to the
rapid development of ﬁber-based technology for telecom-
munications. They are operated in a conventional master
oscillator power ﬁber ampliﬁer conﬁguration (MOPFA),
with a seed laser providing the desired 1083 nm radiation
(a DBR laser diode [16,17] or a ﬁber laser [10]). OP rates
are crucially determined by the number of atomic tran-
sitions induced per unit time, which depends both on
the available power intensity and on the spectral char-
acteristics of the laser emission. The laser cavity must
hence be carefully optimized to eﬃciently match the
spectral power distribution proﬁle to the Doppler broad-
ened atomic line.

The main objective of this article is to describe all-
ﬁber 1083 nm laser oscillators specially designed for he-
lium OP. To ﬁnely characterize their spectral character-
istics and assess their performances a series of tests and
measurements is performed. Absolute OP performances
are actually diﬃcult to determine because experimental
results strongly depend on the choice of operating condi-
tions. The second objective of this article is to present in

detail the basic tests performed in order to provide refer-
ence tools that can be used to quantitatively characterize
and appropriately compare all 1083 nm sources available
for helium OP. Section 2 brieﬂy compiles the relevant
features of the 23S-23P transition and describes the cur-
rently used OP schemes to specify the main laser require-
ments. Section 3 describes the architecture of the ﬁber
oscillators and the performed optical measurements. Sec-
tion 4 focuses on the measurements of the atomic re-
sponse to the laser spectral characteristics which provide
a guide to optimal design of ﬁber lasers tailored to OP
applications.

2 Metastability exchange optical pumping and
laser requirements

MEOP is a polarization technique involving only helium
atoms, based on an indirect spin orientation process [8,
9]. Due to hyperﬁne coupling in the 23S state, OP on
the electronic 23S-23P transition induces partial orien-
tation of the nuclei of the metastable atoms. Metastabil-
ity exchange occurs during collisions in which an incom-
ing metastable atom transfers its electronic excitation
energy to an incoming ground state atom, leaving the
outgoing ground state atom with the partially polarized
nucleus.

The structure of the low lying energy states of he-
lium and of the 23S-23P transition at null magnetic ﬁeld
is indicated in Fig. 1. More details and numbers can

be found in [18] and references therein. The atomic res-
onance lines are distributed over nearly 70 GHz, with
line widths originating from various processes. The ra-
107 s−1.
diative decay rate of the 23P state is 1.02
Atomic collisions introduce a pressure-dependent con-
tribution (108 s−1/mbar). For gas conﬁned in an OP
cell, the atomic lines are strongly Doppler broadened

×

at room temperature. The Doppler full width half maxi-
mum (FWHM) D is on the order of 2 GHz for the helium
atom (at 300 K D=1.98 GHz FWHM for 3He, 1.72 GHz
FWHM for 4He).

MEOP is usually performed at low helium gas pres-
sure (around 1 mbar) with a low applied magnetic ﬁeld
(up to a few mT). For OP of pure 3He one advanta-
geously uses one of the two resolved components, C8 or
C9 (respectively the 23S, F =1/2 - 23P0 and 23S, F =3/2
- 23P0 transitions) [9]. Isotopic mixtures may be eﬃ-
ciently pumped using the D0 line (23S - 23P0 transition
of 4He) [15], signiﬁcantly shifted from the 3He lines. To
reach these three resonance lines the infrared pumping
laser must be tunable over 40 GHz. The low applied mag-
netic ﬁeld is required only to prevent fast magnetic re-
laxation and it has a negligible eﬀect on the structure of
the atomic states. In particular all Zeeman energy split-
tings are much smaller than the Doppler width and the
pumping light must be circularly polarized to selectively
depopulate adequate sublevels and deposit angular mo-
mentum into the gas. As nuclear polarization builds up
the light absorption strongly decreases due to the deple-
tion of the population in the pumped atomic sublevels.
Simultaneously the absorption probability increases for
light with the opposite circular polarization, so that any
residual fraction of the pumping beam with that wrong
circular polarization will very eﬃciently contribute to re-
duce the ultimate nuclear orientation [9,10]. In practice
the beam polarization (and hence the optical quality of
all elements along the light path including the OP cell
windows) becomes especially crucial at high laser inten-
sities. A set of high quality polarizing cube and low order
quaterwave plate is usually inserted in front of the OP
cell to get pure circular polarization. Therefore the laser
light must have a linear polarization, whose long term
stability directly determines that of the eﬀective pump-
ing power.

Operation at high magnetic ﬁeld has recently been
shown to yield improved OP performances at higher gas
pressure [19,20]. The structure of the energy levels is
strongly modiﬁed and the various Zeeman sublevels are
no longer degenerate. This advantageously removes the
stringent constraint on the degree of light polarization
for the pumping beam. However it also substantially ex-
tends the required tunability range for the laser source,
to nearly 150 GHz at 1.5 T for instance [18].

Extensive studies of the MEOP process have been
performed in sealed glass cells over the past forty years.
In order to populate the 23S metastable state, a plasma
discharge is sustained in the helium gas. In short, the
steady state density of 23S atoms (hence the OP light
absorption and angular momentum deposition rates in
the gas) increases with the plasma intensity. Yet vari-
ous operating conditions (gas purity, pressure and cell
dimensions) may set limits to the actual 23S lifetime
and density. The discharge also introduces substantial
nuclear relaxation, due to collisions in the highly ex-

cited states, emission of circularly polarized ﬂuorescence
light by the plasma [21], or formation of metastable He2
molecules at high pressures (a process enhanced at high
laser powers due to massive promotion of He atoms to
the 23P state, where the cross section to produce these
He2 molecules is 100 times larger than in the 23S state
[22]). The most favorable plasma conditions, which lead
to highest polarizations but slow pumping rates, are usu-
ally found for weak discharges in a very pure He gas at
low pressure for transverse cell dimensions of order a
few centimeters. Indeed, the actual optimal plasma and
pressure also depend on OP cell shape and size (e.g. due
to radiation trapping), as well as on OP laser power and
spectral characteristics [10].

The optimal operating conditions have recently been
revisited due to the development of applications where
large quantities of highly polarized 3He gas are needed.
Most current schemes are based on gas ﬂow through one
or several OP cell(s), where it gets optically pumped at
low pressure and mT magnetic ﬁeld, and accumulation
of compressed polarized gas in appropriate storage ves-
sels [11,12,23]. Cell dimensions, materials and gas ﬂow
rates are optimized to achieve the best eﬃciency with
the available laser source, which usually results from a
trade oﬀ between high nuclear polarizations and fast pro-
duction rates. In addition actual OP conditions may not
be ideal (gas purity is for instance never as high as in
carefully prepared sealed cells). Taking into account the
ﬁnite transit time of the atoms in the OP cell, pressure,
atomic transition line and discharge intensity are also
often selected to shorten the OP time. In all cases the
latter decreases at high photon ﬂuxes, leading to im-
proved performance when powerful lasers are available.
The need for very high laser output powers is further
increased by the rapid development of polarized 3He ap-
plications, which requires either to upscale the existing
gas polarizers or to signiﬁcantly improve the overall pro-
duction rates in order to meet the growing demand for
polarized gas.

MEOP is a very eﬃcient and fast process. It typi-
cally yields 2 polarized nuclei per absorbed photon at
1083 nm, but this eﬃciency is reduced at high nuclear
polarizations [10]. Therefore a strong increase in laser
power is required to slightly improve the steady state
nuclear polarization close to the limit set by the intrin-
sic non linear eﬀects in OP [9].

To remain eﬃcient at high laser powers and mini-
mize line saturation eﬀects, OP must involve the largest
possible number of 23S atoms, i.e. optimally interact
simultaneously with all velocity classes. A singlemode
laser is absorbed by atoms from a single velocity class,
whose pressure-broadened line width δ determines the
fraction of 23S atoms actually in resonance with the
laser: Xs=δ/D (typically 1 % at 1 mbar for pure 3He
gas at room temperature). The photon absorption prob-
ability per atom (proportional to the power density, i.e
the light intensity per unit area) is equal to the spon-

taneous emission rate for a critical laser power density
Pcrit. = 2ω3~DXs/3√πc2Tij = 0.277Xs/Tij (W/cm2),
where ω is 2π times the resonance frequency, ~ 1/2π
times the Planck constant, c the velocity of light and
Tij the transition matrix element between the relevant
atomic sublevels i and j [9]. It is of order 10 mW/cm2 for
a circularly polarized singlemode laser (Xs=1 %) tuned
to the C8 line (Tij = 0.29), and 1 W/cm2 for a broadband
laser emitting over the entire Doppler line width (Xs=1).
A more quantitative description of the impact of optical
saturation on the OP dynamics can be derived from a
realistic and detailed model of the OP process and from
computer calculations taking into account the spectral
and geometric features of the laser beam [10]. A single
phenomenological parameter (Xs) is used to specify the
spectral coverage between the laser and Doppler proﬁles.
This parameter is mainly determined by the laser line
width and mode structure. Collisional redistribution be-
tween velocity classes also plays a role [18], but it is only
crudely taken into account for the numerical simulations
[10]. Attempts to accurately reproduce saturation pro-
ﬁles measured for narrowband laser sources bring out the
need to improve such input parameters, and maybe also
to include other eﬀects like radiative broadening of reso-
nance lines (at high laser powers) [24]. For a highly mul-
timode laser, an optimal spectral coverage is expected to
exist: on the one hand the number of atoms signiﬁcantly
excited by resonant light within the Doppler proﬁle in-
creases with the laser line width; on the other hand the
laser eﬃciency decreases for an excessively broad emis-
sion spectrum, due to reduced absorption rates in the
wings of the Doppler atomic line. Assuming for instance
a continuous Gaussian laser frequency distribution of
width L, the fraction of atoms submitted to more than
half of the incident power varies as erf (pLn(2)L/D); it
starts growing almost linearly with L/D then rises more
slowly, exceeding 90% for L/D > 1.4. In contrast the ra-
tio of the total absorbed laser power to the incident one
scales like 1/p1 + L2/D2; it becomes for instance less
than 50% for L/D > 1.7. Therefore the optimal coverage
may be qualitatively inferred to lie around L

D.

In summary, the OP rates basically depend on the
number of atomic transitions induced per unit time, i.e.
the light absorption rate, which in turn depends on the
available power intensity but also on the spectral charac-
teristics of the laser emission. Nevertheless a large num-
ber of operating conditions (pressure, cell dimensions,
discharge intensity, gas purity, gas ﬂow rate, etc.) play a
role in the OP process, simultaneously and in an intri-
cate way. It is thus very diﬃcult to assess the eﬃciency
of a particular laser source in terms of absolute OP per-
formances. One way out may be the comparison of dif-
ferent types of laser sources under the same conditions
[25]. But the variety of experimental parameters that
need to be controlled and the diﬃculty encountered in
obtaining identical beam divergences and intensity pro-
ﬁles for lasers require considerable eﬀort. The choice of

≃

operating conditions may also be critical, either to em-
phasize the relevant diﬀerences between the lasers or to
test the sources in a conﬁguration suited for a particu-
lar application. A diﬀerent approach is presented in this
article, which focuses on the laser spectral characteris-
tics relevant for MEOP of 3He. The selected protocols
provide conclusive results that hardly depend on the ex-
perimental conditions. Detailed information on the ﬁber
laser line width and mode structure is obtained from
purely optical measurements. Further characterization
with very basic equipment is provided by tests of the
atomic response on the 23S-23P transition at null nu-
clear polarization, which do not involve the intricate OP
process.

The Yb3+ ion advantageously exhibits large absorption
cross sections in the 915-925 nm range and a more impor-
tant one around 975 nm, where low cost powerful laser
diodes are commercially available for pumping. In a Ge
co-doped silica matrix, transitions between sublevels of
the ground 2F7/2 and excited 2F5/2 states result in two
main emission lines: a narrow intense one at 975 nm
and a broad one extending between 1 and 1.2 µm. DCF
are preferred for high power operation, the large inner
cladding allowing propagation of the multimode pump
beam around the doped active core and multiple crossing
across it. Continuous wave (CW) operation with output
powers exceeding 110 W has been demonstrated using
DCF [33].

3 Architecture and operation of the ﬁber lasers

3.2 The ﬁber oscillators

3.1 Tunable 1083 nm ﬁber lasers

Diﬀerent laser sources have been used to optically pump
3He gas: DBR semiconductor lasers [15,26], arc lamp
pumped Nd:LNA lasers [27]. Good results have been ob-
tained with home-built multimode LNA lasers [1,14,28].
Wide dissemination and use outside the laboratory en-
vironment has however been hindered due to inherent
drawbacks and diﬃculties: modest provision and com-
mercial availability of high quality crystal rods, limited
output power (5-8 W, due to severe thermal lensing
eﬀects inducing frequent rod breaking), low wall plug
eﬃciency, need for routine cleaning and re-alignment
of the open air laser cavity optics. The emergence of
ﬁber technology has allowed the development of power-
ful light ampliﬁers (delivering tens of watts) and novel
laser sources in the near infrared region. Fiber lasers in-
volving an external cavity in Littrow conﬁguration have
recently been demonstrated to provide good eﬃciency
and wide tunability range [29]. However, as explained in
the previous section, narrowband emission sources are
not well suited for OP purposes.

Powerful broadband all-ﬁber lasers are therefore de-
veloped for OP of 3He. They are based on the convenient
MOPFA conﬁguration. The master oscillator is a low
power ﬁber laser designed for tunable, multimode emis-
sion at 1083 nm with a spectral range on the order of
1-2 GHz. A large output power is provided by a power
booster, which can be separately optimized for maxi-
mal output eﬃciency. With adequate optical isolation
between the two parts and operation of the power ampli-
ﬁer in the saturated regime, the spectral characteristics
of the whole set-up are those of the master oscillator.
Both the master oscillator (characterized in this work)
and the power ampliﬁer (described in detail in [30,31])
take advantage of the high gain provided by Ytterbium-
doped double clad ﬁbers (DCF) pumped by broad stripe
laser diodes.

The architecture of the ﬁber laser oscillator is based on a
Fabry-P´erot (FP) linear cavity closed by a high reﬂectiv-
ity ﬁber mirror and a tunable ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG).
The gain section consists of a Yb-doped DCF pumped
by a 975 nm laser diode (absorption: 0.9 dB/m) using
the V-groove side pump technique (VSP R
(cid:13): the pumping
light is launched through imbedded V-grooves formed
directly into the DCF inner cladding and is totally re-
ﬂected on the ﬁber side-wall, yielding up to 90% coupling
eﬃciency [34]). The doped ﬁber length is about 3.5 m,
it is not optimized in terms of output power and pump
absorption in this work. Inside the protective polymer
outer cladding, the inner glass cladding is about 200 µm
in diameter with a numerical aperture of 0.45 and a star
shape proﬁle to ensure eﬃcient mode mixing and high
absorption of the pump light in the doped area. A pair of
all-glass silica ﬁbers, single mode at 1 µm, are spliced at
both ends of the DCF to allow connection to the other
ﬁber optical components.

The tunable FBG, used for frequency discrimina-
tion, serves as a low transmission output mirror for the
laser cavity. The two key characteristics of the FBG are
thus the FWHM of its operating range and the reﬂec-
tivity. They both play an important role in setting the
laser power and line width, and must be optimized and
controlled. The tunable FBG is thermally isolated and
temperature regulated to stabilize the laser frequency.
Piezo-electrical control of mechanical strain applied to
the grating allows ﬁne tuning of the laser frequency to
the helium resonance lines.

Fig. 2 displays the architecture of a ﬁber oscillator in
which a loop mirror is used to close the FP linear cavity.
Fiber loop reﬂectors exhibit large reﬂectivities (50-75%)
over a broad frequency range [35]. The selective tunable
FBG is spliced at the output end of the cavity. It directly
controls both the operation frequency and the FWHM
of the laser.

A comprehensive introduction to the capabilities of
Yb-doped ﬁber lasers can be found for instance in [32].

The operation of that loop mirror oscillator is here-
after fully characterized. Subsequent comparison is made

a high reﬂectivity FBG to fully optimize the laser for
OP applications (see Fig. 12 in section 4, that depicts

to build the complete all-ﬁber MOPFA laser). The two

tral behavior.

achieved by a ﬁber polarizer spliced at the end of the
laser cavity. These two components induce a total 3 dB
loss, taken into account to determine the power actually
delivered at the output of the tunable FBG in Fig. 4.

The average spectral bandwidth (Fig. 4, solid dots) is
measured using a FP analyzer (an air gap etalon whose
cavity length is piezo-modulated at low frequency) with
typically 10 GHz free spectral range (FSR) and 80 ﬁ-
nesse. The laser modes are not resolved, the laser cavity
FSR being in the MHz range. Substantial FWHM broad-
ening is observed when the pump power is increased. An
abrupt change in FWHM occurs above Ppump=920 mW,
in the absence of any correlated modiﬁcation of the laser
output power.

meets the laser requirements. It includes the whole 3He
and 4He absorption spectrum (0.275 nm broad, start-
ing at 1082.908 nm in air for D0 at null magnetic ﬁeld).
Piezo-control of the FBG actually allows ﬁne tuning of
the laser over 0.8 nm, i.e. more than 200 GHz (Fig. 3,
insert). Therefore all components of the 23S-23P tran-
sition can be reached, even for OP in a 1.5 T applied
magnetic ﬁeld as indicated in section 2.

The loop mirror oscillator delivers up to 60 mW for
a launched pump power Ppump=1900 mW, with a laser
threshold around Ppump=500 mW (Fig. 4, open squares).
An isolator protects the oscillator from accidentally back-
reﬂected light during operation. Linear polarization is

Intensity noise (IN) measurements are performed for the
loop mirror oscillator described in Fig. 2 using a photodi-
ode with 700 MHz bandwidth connected both to a fast
digital oscilloscope and to an electrical spectrum ana-
lyzer (ESA). Fig. 5 displays time variations of the out-
put intensity and frequency spectra obtained at three
pump powers (Ppump = 593, 839 and 1167 mW). The
frequency resolution (1 MHz) does not allow to charac-
terize the frequency and repetition rate of the relaxation
oscillations in the self-pulsing regime (see below and [30,
31,37]). The peaks seen on the ESA output traces re-
sult from longitudinal modes emitted under the laser
line width envelope beating together. This inter-modal
beat signal gives access to the number and frequency
splitting of the modes emitted on the probed time scale.
Three main types of behavior can be distinguished as
the pump power is increased. The ﬁrst one is observed
near laser threshold (e.g. Fig. 5a: Ppump=593 mW, laser
FWHM 1.2 GHz). The laser operates spontaneously in
self-pulsing regime, delivering series of pulses of some-
times relatively high peak power. This behavior is thus
potentially harmful in view of subsequent high power
ampliﬁcation. The corresponding IN spectra only include

Fig. 5 Time variations (left graphs) and frequency spectra
(right graphs) of the laser intensity for the loop mirror oscil-
lator. Fig. 5a: Ppump = 593 mW; self-pulsing regime, with
only a few emitted modes. The dotted line added in the
right graph is a spectrum obtained from another randomly
triggered singleshot recording (see text). Fig. 5b: Ppump =
839 mW; unstable regime, switching between pulsed and CW
operation. Fig. 5c: Ppump= 1167 mW; stable regime, with
CW and highly multimode operation. The output powers of
the oscillator are indicated in the left graphs (Pout).

beat frequencies below 150 MHz. Their statistical anal-
ysis shows that only peaks up to 40 MHz are always
present, a few extra ones randomly appearing at frequen-
cies that are other integer multiple of the FSR of the
laser cavity. The second type of behavior (e.g. Fig. 5b:
Ppump=839 mW, laser FWHM still below 1.5 GHz) is
characterized by emission of intense light pulses alter-
nating in time with CW light emission. In this case,
inter-modal beat frequencies are regularly and perma-
nently distributed under a typically 150 MHz wide en-
velope. The third and last type of behavior (e.g. Fig. 5c:
Ppump=1167 mW and above) corresponds to a stable
regime with a non zero power continuously emitted, even
on atomic lifetime scale (0.1 µs). A very large number
of modes simultaneously exist inside the cavity: the IN
spectrum is a comb of peaks with uniform frequency
splitting (the cavity FSR) extending over the whole in-
strument limited detection bandwidth (the laser FWMH
has jumped over the sharp discontinuity seen in Fig. 4
and is in that regime signiﬁcantly larger than 2 GHz).

Strong non linear eﬀects are known to occur in high
gain rare-earth-doped ﬁbers. The high powers supported
by the Yb-doped DCF can lead to instabilities or huge
intensity ﬂuctuations due to distributed backscattering
eﬀects that are exacerbated in the linear cavity conﬁgu-
ration [36,37]. Substantial variations of the laser band-
width with pump power have been previously reported
[38], and intensity ﬂuctuations as well as changes of the

mode structure investigated [37], for Yb-doped ﬁber lasers
in Littrow conﬁguration. These dynamical behaviors are
reminiscent of those obtained in Er-doped ﬁber lasers
[39,40], but their exact physical origin in Yb-doped ﬁbers
may not be yet fully established [30,31,32,37]. Self-pulsing
has been demonstrated to be dependent on passive cav-
ity losses and favored at high losses [30,31,41]. The loop
mirror used in the oscillator cavity has an intrinsic loss of
order 1 dB and the reﬂectivity of the FBG is optimized.
However signiﬁcant losses may be due to technical diﬃ-
culties encountered in achieving quality splices between
the Yb-doped DCF and the pure silica ﬁber used for the
junctions. Polarization dependent losses induced by the
loop mirror are also expected to contribute to the occur-
rence of the self-pulsing regime. With the loop mirror
oscillator, similar Ppump threshold values are observed
for the changes of mode structure and temporal dynam-
ics and for the variations of average FWHM. However
the comparison of diﬀerent types of linear cavity lasers
indicates that it may well be fortuitous [30,31].

It is worth noting the correlation observed for this
loop mirror oscillator between temporal behavior and
mode structure: self-pulsing behavior and a limited num-
ber of emitted modes (Fig. 5a); stable intensity and mul-
timode operation (Fig. 5c). In contrast, a diﬀerent ﬁber
oscillator based on a ring laser cavity (Fig. 6) exhibited
stable output power but quasi-singlemode structure [24].
For that ring cavity laser (1.64 GHz FWHM) no ESA

measurements had been performed. But on one hand
the laser intensity had been monitored using a fast pho-
todiode (response time well below 1 µs) and was indeed
stable in time. On the other hand the light transmitted
through a FP etalon with ﬁxed length, FSR 1.5 GHz and
spectral bandwidth 15 MHz (i.e. comparable to the 23S-
23P radiative line width in the presence of collisions in
a 1 mbar cell), was discontinuous. Non zero transmitted
intensities could be observed only for very short periods

of time (6.7 µs on average, with 0.2 µs rise time and
0.2-0.5 µs fall time at 1/e), separated by long periods
of null transmission (215 µs long on average). Assuming
a large mode jitter over the observed 1.64 GHz FWHM
to result in random coincidence of the modes frequen-
cies with the transmission bandwidth of the FP etalon,
statistical analysis of repeated measurements lead to the
conclusion that only 3 or 4 laser modes were simultane-
ously emitted. This had been conﬁrmed later by a low
saturation threshold in light absorption measurements
(method and meaning described in section 4) and ex-
plains the moderate OP performances of this ring laser
despite its proper FWHM and CW operation [24].

≃

Therefore the same FP ﬁlter is used with the loop
mirror oscillator to perform similar tests, for compar-
ison and cross-check with the ESA measurements. CW
light is indeed transmitted above Ppump
1300 mW, sug-
gesting truly multimode laser operation on the relevant
atomic time scale (0.1 µs) in the stable regime. In con-
trast, in the self-pulsing regime light is seldom emitted
in the FP spectral transmission bandwidth and the aver-
age durations of the null-transmission periods typically
vary from 1 ms close to laser threshold, to 0.1 ms at
Ppump=760 mW for instance. These observations fully
conﬁrm the conclusions drawn from the above described
IN measurements.

3.5 Mode dynamics

The comparison between the IN spectra and the mea-
sured FWHM of the loop mirror oscillator suggests that
in the self-pulsing regime the measured broad laser band-
width results from very large mode jitter inside the cav-
ity. In order to conﬁrm this and to directly observe the
mode dynamics, we observe the time variation of the
beat signal between the ﬁber oscillator output and that
of a singlemode 1083 nm DBR diode (50 mW output
power, 3 MHz bandwidth [15]). To conveniently tune
the two lasers to one another to better than 1 GHz, a
ﬂuorescence signal from a sealed 3He cell is used.

Fig. 7b to 7d display power spectra obtained by fast
Fourier transform of single shot digital recordings (du-
ration: 0.1 µs, 5 ms and 0.1 s respectively) of the signal
delivered by a fast photodiode located on the path of
the two superimposed beams. The DBR diode is oper-
ating at ﬁxed frequency (typically a few hundred MHz
away from the central frequency of the ﬁber oscillator)
and the oscillator is used at low pump power (Ppump =
593 mW, self-pulsing regime). For comparison a spec-
trum obtained without the DBR diode beam (recording
time: 0.1 µs) is shown in Fig. 7a. The low frequency parts
of the heterodyne IN spectra (DBR diode plus ﬁber os-
cillator) in Fig. 7b to 7d are identical to those obtained
with the ﬁber oscillator alone (homodyne autocorrela-
tion spectrum) using the same set-up (Fig. 7a) or us-
ing the ESA (see Fig. 5a). As detailed in the previous

plots have identical frequency span, 1 GHz full scale. Fig. 7a
and 7b: 0.1 µs recording time. The autocorrelation spectrum
of the oscillator (Fig. 7a) also appears in Fig. 7b at low fre-
quencies. The beat signal of the ﬁber laser and the singlemode
diode (set of peaks around 0.6 GHz in Fig. 7b) indicates that
only a few modes are simultaneously emitted. Mode jitter is
evidenced by the broad spread of the beat peak frequencies
as the recording time increases (Fig. 7c: 5 ms, Fig. 7d: 0.1 s).

subsection they correspond to the inter-modal beat sig-
nal of the ﬁber oscillator. At higher frequencies series of
peaks appear which correspond to the beat signal of the
diode and the oscillator. Frequency splittings are here
again set by the ﬁber cavity FSR. Only one comb of beat
peaks appears at very short recording times (Fig. 7b).
Repeated measurements demonstrate that close to laser
threshold a very small number of contiguous modes are
indeed emitted on the atomic time scale (0.1 µs). On one
hand the central frequency of this comb of beat peaks is
observed to change from shot to shot, randomly located
within the detection bandwidth (of order 1 GHz). The
frequency stability of the DBR diode is checked by the
observation of the beat signal between two diﬀerent DBR
diodes in the same experimental conditions. The time
variations of the beat frequencies are thus attributable
to the oscillator only. On the other hand the spectra of
single shot recordings taken on much longer time scales
(several ms or more) display a continuous comb of beat
peaks extending beyond 1 GHz (see Fig. 7d). Both ob-
servations conﬁrm that a large jitter of a small num-
ber modes is responsible for the large average oscillator
FWHM measured with the modulated FP etalon in the
self-pulsing regime. They also indicate that for He atoms
the laser would appear as quasi-singlemode despite this
broad apparent optical spectrum.

Away from the laser threshold, the number of modes
beating with the diode increases with the pump power.
Broadband (

the atomic time scale is observed in the stable regime.

Finally the observed temporal behavior, mode struc-

4.1 Line width measurements

Unsophisticated but accurate measurements of the laser
average FWHM can be achieved using a sample of 3He
gas. The piezo control is used to sweep the oscillator
frequency over the C8 and C9 lines. Fluorescence light
(or laser absorption) at null nuclear polarization is mon-
itored using a photodiode to extract the resonance line
width for a weak probe beam intensity. Power densities
well below a few mW/cm2 are needed to avoid satu-
ration (see next subsection). When circularly polarized
light is used a strong local ﬁeld inhomogeneity must be
imposed in the He cell to prevent nuclear polarization
build-up, which would signiﬁcantly alter the line proﬁles
[18]. At high laser intensities ﬁnite orientation can still
be produced in the metastable state despite strong nu-
clear relaxation in the ground state (over-polarization
of the 23S atoms [10]) and the best way to avoid OP
eﬀects is to use linearly polarized light. In any case the
measured relative amplitudes of the two resonance peaks
must correspond to the known ratio of the C8 and C9
line intensities (1.284 at very low magnetic ﬁeld). Abso-
lute calibration of the frequency scale is provided by the
hyperﬁne splitting between C8 and C9 (6.74 GHz). The
experimental resonance line width results from the con-
volution of the atomic Doppler proﬁle with the spectral
envelope of the laser.

D2.
The laser FWHM L is thus given by L2 = D2
Fig. 8 displays the obtained laser FWHMs as a func-
tion of the pump power for the loop mirror oscillator.
The measured variation is in good qualitative agreement
with the behavior discussed in section 3 (little change up
to Ppump=920 mW, then abrupt broadening and linear
increase above Ppump=1100 mW). The noticeable quan-
titative diﬀerence (20-30%) between these FWHM re-
sults and those obtained with the FP analyzer (Fig. 4,
solid dots) mainly arises from the fact that two measure-
ments were not performed in the same frequency range.
Indeed, over the 200 GHz broad tuning range, the oper-
ating conditions of the laser cavity vary due to changes
in the loop mirror reﬂectivity [35]. The inﬂuence of the
mirror characteristics on the laser FWHM is analyzed
and discussed in more detail in [30,31]. Experimentally,
using the piezo-modulated FP analyzer to monitor the

Fig. 8 FWHM of the loop mirror oscillator obtained from
C8 and C9 resonance linewidth measurements.

laser FWHM (see section 3), we actually observe changes
of order 20% with operating frequency between the ex-
treme limits of the tuning range of the loop mirror oscil-
lator. The amplitudes of these FWHM changes depend
on how close to threshold the laser is operated. Therefore
for OP applications the laser should be kept working in
stable operating conditions and precisely characterized
at the atomic frequency used to polarize the gas.

4.2 Absorption measurements

Absorption measurements provide quantitative informa-
tion on the actual fraction of light that can be used
for eﬃcient OP of the atomic nuclei. Laser absorption
is measured as a function of the incident power den-
sity for the oscillator tuned to the C9 resonance line, in
a sealed cell (5 cm long, 5 cm in diameter) ﬁlled with
1.6 mbar of ultrapure 3He gas. In order to perform ac-
curate comparison between several operating conditions
of the laser cavity measurements are performed succes-
sively with identical discharge conditions to keep the 23S
number density constant. The same basic equipment is
required, except that a lock-in ampliﬁer advantageously
improves the signal-to-noise ratio at low laser powers. As
the laser power is varied, care is taken to keep the pho-
todiode operating at nearly constant output level (using
attenuators) to avoid possible biases due to saturation
or non-linear response of the device. The gas is also al-
ways maintained at null nuclear polarization. The laser
beam with Gaussian transverse intensity proﬁle is ex-
panded and a diaphragm of known open area is inserted
to select a small central fraction of the collimated beam.
Over the probed section the radial variation of the laser
power has been checked not to exceed a few percents, so
that the (quasi)uniform power densities are precisely de-
termined from absolute power measurements. To reach
strong optical saturation of the gas sample and to com-
plete the investigations close to laser threshold, a 0.5 W
ﬁber ampliﬁer is used to boost up the light power deliv-
ered by the laser oscillator.

low launched pump powers (solid symbols) the absorp-
tion proﬁles do not vary much with Ppump. They are
quite similar to those usually obtained with a single-
mode DBR diode (Fig. 9a, dotted line: data from ref-
erence [24], obtained in the same cell with comparable
discharge conditions and measurement protocol). This
conﬁrms the conclusion drawn from the optical mea-
surements and spectral analysis in section 3 for the un-
stable and self-pulsing regimes. As pump power is in-
creased, the strong decrease of absorption due to optical
saturation suddenly occurs at much higher power densi-
ties. This change in atomic response to laser excitation
is a signature of the abrupt transition of the oscillator
to the broadband multimode emission regime. At high
launched pump powers (above Ppump=920 mW, open
symbols) the relative absorptions measured for a ﬁxed
power density become signiﬁcantly larger when Ppump is
increased

duce the power density

To characterize this change in behavior we intro-
P1/3 where the measured ab-

sorption reaches 1/3 of its maximum value (dashed line
in Fig. 9a).
P1/3 is plotted in Fig. 9b as a function of
the loop mirror oscillator FWHM. It indeed remains al-
most constant up to Ppump=920 mW, and close to the
0.64 W/cm2 value typically obtained with the single-
mode diode (solid star, Fig. 9b). It then increases quite
linearly with the laser FWHM above Ppump=1100 mW.
This sudden change of absorption saturation threshold
correlates precisely with the abrupt change in spectral
behavior described in section 3.

A relevant quantity for the OP process is the total
number of absorbed photons per second, since it is the
angular momentum deposition rate that determines the
actual number of oriented nuclei. Absolute absorption
rates are therefore plotted in Fig. 10 (same measure-
ments performed with the loop mirror oscillator, data
without normalization). At all light power densities the

mirror oscillator (same data sets as in Fig. 9, but without
normalization to maximum values).

absorption rates are observed to vary by more than a
factor 2 over the probed range of launched pump pow-
ers. For small Ppump (solid symbols) the absorption rates
at low laser intensities rapidly vary with power density
down to 10 mW/cm2. They tend to increase with Ppump,
as can be expected due to the increased number of emit-
ted laser modes at resonance with the atoms. Diﬀerences
however become hardly noticeable above a few hundreds
mW/cm2. For Ppump >920 mW (open symbols) satura-
tion eﬀects are small at very and moderately low power
densities. The maximum absorption rates decrease when
Ppump rises due to excessively large laser FWHMs (use-
less power emitted outside the Doppler line). At higher
laser powers (above 1 W/cm2) the absorption rate is
nearly twice larger than that obtained at low Ppump be-
cause of multimode light emission by the loop mirror os-
cillator. This absorption rate is observed to be indepen-
dent of Ppump, which means that the measured change of
relative absorption and saturation threshold (Fig. 9) is
exactly compensated by the eﬀect of strongly increased

10

G. Tastevin et al.

FWHMs in that regime (Fig. 8). Above 20 W/cm2 very
strong optical saturation occurs whatever the laser FWHM
and operation regime (absortion rates well below 1%).

The observed modiﬁcation of absorption proﬁles and
atomic resonance line saturation rates is evidence of a
strong variation of the spectral coverage between the
Doppler and laser proﬁles under the inﬂuence of the op-
erating conditions of the loop mirror cavity. The absorp-
tion measurements do not provide as many details on
the mode structure and behavior of the ﬁber laser as
do the optical spectral measurements in section 3. But
they are rather easy to carry out, and the experimen-
tal data can be quantitatively analyzed to get a relevant
characterization of the laser features for OP purposes.

To emphasize the inﬂuence of the laser spectral char-
acteristics on the response of the atomic system, Fig. 11
displays the change of absorption rates with the laser
FWHM for various light power densities shined onto the
gas sample. Fig. 11a shows the expected crossover behav-

are not available with the loop mirror oscillator. The re-
sults obtained outside the multimode regime (appear-
ing at L/D < 0.56 in Fig. 11b) have been included
only to visualize the amplitude of absorption changes
observed at small Ppump. But, as demonstrated in the
previous section, the measured FWHMs (1-1.1 GHz be-
low Ppump < 920 mW) indeed result from frequency jit-
ter and on their time scale the atoms actually interact
with a ﬁnite set of discrete modes. This situation might
tentatively be described by a set narrow continuous dis-
tributions with increasing eﬀective FWHMs (to account
for the observed change in IN spectra envelopes with
Ppump). This would certainly make the low Ppump data
delineate clear absorption maxima in Fig. 11b, with lo-
cation and rounded shape closer to expectations. How-
ever the values of these eﬀective FWHMs are diﬃcult
to accurately assess a priori, and their meaning and rel-
evance for further studies are questionable considering
the crude description of interaction probabilities between
atoms and photons in the model.

ior between the high and low power limits qualitatively
discussed above. These results are obtained with the
phenomenological OP model described in [10], using for
the spectral coverage parameter Xs the rough estimate
erf (pLn(2)L/D) introduced in section 2. The experi-
mental data are plotted in Fig. 11b. Measurements ap-
pear to be in good qualitative agreement with the com-
puted estimates. For Ppump >920 mW (data points with
L/D
1 in Fig. 11b) we observe at the lowest power
densities the expected strong absorption decrease with
laser FWHM, above a maximum located somewhere be-
low L/D = 0.5. The dominant contribution here comes
from the growing fraction of oﬀ resonance photons in
the incident beam, resulting in the 1/p1 + L2/D2 scal-
ing discussed in section 2. The location of the absorption
1 as the laser power in-
maximum moves towards L/D
creases as indicated by the computations. At very high
powers absorption stops varying with the laser FWHM
for L/D > 1. Relevant experimental data with L/D < 1

4.3 Laser optimization for OP applications

Data in Fig. 10 and 11 indicate that in order to opti-
mize absorption the laser FWHM should lie somewhere
between 1 and 2.4 GHz, depending on laser intensity. For
OP purposes the laser intensities are usually on the order
of 1 W/cm2. Therefore the optimal emission bandwidth
should indeed be comparable to the atomic Doppler line
width, as qualitatively expected from the discussion in
section 2. However this FWHM range cannot be properly
investigated with the loop mirror cavity oscillator, due
to the abrupt FWHM jump from 1.1 to 2.5 GHz (see
Fig. 8) as well as the switching from quasi-singlemode
to truly multimode operation. The cavity conﬁguration
needs to be changed to achieve multimode operation and
laser FWHM adjustable down to 1 GHz.

This is achieved with double FBG linear cavities, us-
ing a high reﬂectivity ﬁber Bragg grating instead of the
loop mirror. The architecture of the double FBR oscilla-
tor is depicted in Fig. 12 (master oscillator). With that

set is more easily reduced since FBG mirrors have no
intrinsic losses.

Optimization of the FBG characteristics turns out
to be crucial to obtain both stable multimode operation
and narrow spectral bandwidth [30,31]. The selective low
reﬂectivity FBG mainly determines the smallest FWHM
achievable in multimode operation (
1 GHz). Most fre-
quently the range of launched pump powers where the
double FBG oscillators exhibit unstable behavior is very
small. Sometimes no self-pulsing is observed, even close
to laser threshold. The FWHM of the double FBG os-
cillator increases with the pump power. It can thus be
adjusted to optimize the OP performances of the laser.
However the pump power also directly controls the power
delivered by the oscillator. Therefore, to use it as a mas-
ter oscillator, care must be taken to get enough output
power to feed into the high gain power ﬁber ampliﬁer.
Recently considerable progress has been made in the
processes used to imprint Bragg grating patterns onto
photosensitive ﬁbers. Quality FBG tailored to the user’s
speciﬁcations are now available. This, combined with a
better control of all loss sources inside the laser cavity
(e.g. in the ﬁber splicings), allows to routinely build mul-
timode tunable ﬁber oscillators with adjustable FWHM
between 1 and 2 GHz.

Fig. 12 shows the complete structure of the dedi-
cated all-ﬁber MOPFA lasers designed for operation at
1083 nm with optimized spectral characteristics in view
of OP applications. The power booster is here for in-
stance a 5W ﬁber power ampliﬁer with two-stage ar-
chitecture. Linear polarization is required at the output
ﬁber connector. For the user’s convenience the output
ﬁber may be a few meters long. Polarization maintaining
ﬁbers are available but still quite expensive. A mechan-
ical polarization controller (extinction ratio >20 dB) is
thus included in the laser to pre-compensate for polariza-
tion changes induced by light propagation in the output
ﬁber.

Test measurements are performed in helium cells with
a double FBG oscillator in MOPFA conﬁguration with
a single-stage 2W ﬁber ampliﬁer, and two other ones
with 5W ﬁber ampliﬁers. These lasers achieve broad-
band multimode emission respectively with 1.63, 1.67
and 2.10 GHz FWHMs (measured at the He resonance
wavelength).

Fig. 13 displays absorption data for the 1.63 GHz
FWHM ﬁber laser with double FBG cavity. Comparison
is made with concomitant measurements performed in
fully identical conditions with a singlemode laser diode.
We use here the same 1.6 mbar 3He cell as that used
to test the loop mirror oscillator (Fig. 10 and 11). How-
ever for the present series of measurements the discharge
is stronger, leading to more metastable atoms excited
in the gas and proportionally higher absorption rates.

in identical conditions for a 1.64 GHz FWHM double FBG
oscillator (solid dots) and a DBR laser diode (open stars)
tuned to the C9 line.

This is in very good agreement with the expected de-
crease obtained from the convolution of the laser and
atomic line proﬁles (1/p1 + L2/D2 = 0.772 for a laser
FWHM L = 1.63 GHz). Saturation occurs at high pow-
ers, but clearly in a much less severe manner for the mul-
timode laser than for the singlemode one. The measured
P1/3 is much larger for the ﬁber
threshold power density
laser (3.1 W/cm2) than for the DBR diode (0.6 W/cm2).
As a consequence the absorbed light power can be as
much as twice larger for the broadband ﬁber laser at
high power densities (Fig. 13b).

Another set of comparative measurements is performed
with the two double FBG cavity oscillators in 5W MOPFA
conﬁguration that have 1.67 and 2.10 GHz FWHMs (Fig. 14).

a smaller bandwidth being there more favorable in the

and conﬁrmed by the numerical calculations (L =0.6-
1 GHz, see Fig. 11). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the two multimode lasers is observed above 1 W/cm2.
This again matches the weak FWHM dependence of the
test results and expectations at high power densities
(see Fig. 11). Saturation eﬀects strongly increase above
1 W/cm2 (Fig. 14a), limiting the rise of deposited power
with incident laser power at higher photon ﬂux densities
(Fig. 14b).

The typical OP power densities presently used for
production of polarized gas lie between 0.2 and 2.4 W/cm2
[11,12,23,42,43]. Our results suggest that optimal per-
formances should be achieved with 2 GHz-broad lasers
at the upper end of that power range, while 1.2-1.5 GHz
FWHMs might be preferred at the lower end. Prelimi-
nary OP measurements performed around 1 W/cm2 in-
dicate that the nuclear polarizations obtained in a 1.3 mbar
3He cell at moderate discharge intensity are 10% higher
for the 1.67 GHz FWHM laser than for the 2.10 GHz
FWHM one. Further experimental work is still needed
to reliably assess the optimal line width in multimode
operation with respect to the OP performances in well
controlled situations. For this purpose the double FBG
cavity conﬁguration provides the most convenient op-
portunity to vary the laser FWHM ad libitum, from one
to a few GHz, through the control of the launched pump
power. Systematic measurements are in progress, both
in sealed cells and in the presence of gas ﬂow. However,
due the variety of OP conditions to be explored, eﬀorts
to develop a predictive model based on accurate phe-
nomenological input parameters must be also continued
to provide a comprehensive overview of the expected op-
timal OP performances.

5 Conclusion

We have demonstrated and tested the operation of all-
ﬁber tunable lasers at 1083 nm for 3He OP applications.
In the linear cavity conﬁguration, with a loop mirror and
a low reﬂectivity ﬁber Bragg grating, evolution of the
laser line width and mode structure with launched pump
power has been observed and analyzed in detail using a
variety of optical measurements. In view of OP appli-
cations, simple tests have also been presented to char-
acterize the laser at the He wavelength on the relevant
time scales. The need for a multimode light source with
a FWHM matched to the atomic line width is clearly
identiﬁed. It is met with the double FBG cavity ﬁber
oscillators.

These stable multimode oscillators with 1-2 GHz spec-
tral FWHM are now combined with power ampliﬁers in
commercially available MOPFA devices, providing stand-
alone all-ﬁber laser sources delivering up to 10 W output
power [31]. Compact turn-key 1083 nm lasers that re-
quire no servicing from the user are attractive and con-
venient tools for research work. They are also ideally

suited for operation outside the physics laboratories, e.g.
at the clinics for on-site production of hyperpolarized gas
next to the magnetic resonance imaging scanner [42]. In
a higher stage MOPFA conﬁguration, a 1 or 2 W all-ﬁber
MOPFA laser with double FBG oscillator can be used
as a master laser to launch a more powerful ﬁber power
booster in order to take full advantage of the truly multi-
mode structure and allow very large scale production of
highly polarized 3He gas. Preliminary tests of operation
at 1083 nm up to 40 W have been performed [44].

For the users, precise line width speciﬁcations and
identiﬁcation of the ultimate physical limitations of MEOP
will contribute to bring new record 3He nuclear polariza-
tions within reach. For the laser manufacturers, the main
technical challenge now lies in the cost-eﬀective produc-
tion of robust, reliable and very powerful ﬁber sources
for production of large quantities of polarized gas to sup-
port the wide dissemination of established applications
of hyperpolarized 3He gas and the emergence of new ones
[45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55].

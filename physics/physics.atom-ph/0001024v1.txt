Abstract

The low-energy scattering of ortho positronium (Ps) by H, He, Ne, and Ar atoms has

been investigated in the coupled-channel framework by using a recently proposed time-

reversal-symmetric nonlocal electron-exchange model potential with a single parameter

C. For H and He we use a three-Ps-state coupled-channel model and for Ar and Ne we

use a static-exchange model. The sensitivity of the results is studied with respect to the

parameter C. Present low-energy cross sections for He, Ne and Ar are in good agreement

with experiment.

Low-energy collision of ortho positronium (Ps) atom with neutral gas atoms and molecules

is of interest in both physics and chemistry. Recently, there have been precise measurements

of low-energy ortho-Ps scattering by H2, N2, He, Ne, Ar, C4H10, and C5H12 [1, 2, 3]. Due

to internal charge and mass symmetry, Ps atom yields zero elastic and even-parity transition

potentials in the direct channel. Ps scattering is dominated mainly by exchange correlation

at low energies.
If N basis states are included for both Ps and target in a coupled-channel
formalism, the number of channels grow as N 2. This complicates the tractability of the Ps

scattering process in a coupled channel scheme compared to the electron scattering. The

dominance of the short-range interaction in Ps scattering causes serious trouble towards the

convergence of any coupled-channel formalism with a truncated basis [4, 5]. The use of 22

coupled Ps pseudostates for Ps-H system in the R-matrix approach has indicated convergence

diﬃculties [5, 6] in Ps-H binding and resonance energies.

To ﬁnd a solution to the nonconvergence problem, we have suggested a nonlocal electron-

exchange model potential [4, 5] with a single parameter C and demonstrated its eﬀectiveness

by performing quantum coupled-channel calculations using the ab initio framework of close

coupling approximation. Two versions of this potential were suggested: one is time-reversal-

symmetric and the other nonsymmetric. The nonsymmetric potential has been applied for the

study of Ps scattering by H [7], He [4] and H2 [8] using a three-Ps-state coupled-channel model.

For He and H2 these studies yielded total cross sections in good agreement with experiments

[1, 2, 3] in addition to producing the correct pick-oﬀ quenching rate for Ps-He at low energies

[9]. Higher Ps-excitation and ionization cross sections were also calculated in these cases to

reproduce the total cross sections at medium and high energies. Previous theoretical studies

[10, 11] on Ps-He produced results in strong disagreement [4] with experiment [1, 2, 3].

In a subsequent application of this model potential to Ps scattering by H [5], it was found

that the symmetric form leads to by far superior result than the nonsymmetric form. The

symmetric form was able to reproduce accurate variational results very precisely for singlet

Ps-H binding and resonance energies; the nonsymmetric form failed to yield such results.

In view of this we reinvestigate the problem of low-energy Ps scattering by He [4] using the

symmetric exchange potential employing the three-Ps-state model used before. We study how

the low-energy cross sections for Ps-H and Ps-He change with the variation of the parameter

C of the potential. Then we also apply this exchange potential to the study of low-energy Ps

scattering by Ne and Ar using a static-exchange model. The present calculation accounts for

the measured low-energy cross sections [1, 2, 3] satisfactorily for He, Ne, and Ar.

The total wave function of the Ps-target system is expanded in terms of the Ps eigenstates

2

as

Ψ±(r1, ..., rN; rN+1, x) = Xν (cid:20)Fν(ρN+1)χν(tN+1)φ0(r1, ..., rj, ..., rN)

where antisymmetrization with respect to Ps- and target-electron coordinates has been made.

Here ρi = (x + ri)/2, ti = (x − ri), where ri, i = 1, ..., N denote the target electron coordinates,

and rN+1 and x are the electron and positron coordinates of Ps; φ0 and χν denote the target
and Ps wave functions, and Fν is the continuum orbital of Ps with respect to the target.

SN +1,j is the total spin of the Ps electron (N + 1) and target electron (j) undergoing exchange
and can have values of 1 or 0. The spin of the positron is conserved in this process and

the exchange proﬁle of the Ps-target system is analogous to the corresponding electron-target

system. Projecting the resultant Schr¨odinger equation on the Ps eigenstates and averaging

over spin states, the resulting momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger scattering equation for a

particular total electronic spin state S can, in general, be written as [11, 12]

Ps in the channel ν ′′ with ǫ′′ the total binding energy of the intermediate Ps and target states,

and E the total energy of the Ps-target system and m the reduced mass. Here

where BD is the direct Born potential and BEj is the model potential for exchange between the

Ps electron (denoted by N + 1) with the jth target electron. For Ps-H scattering both S ≡ S2,1

= 0, 1 will contribute [12]; the corresponding potentials and amplitudes are usually denoted by
B±
ν ′ν, respectively [5]. For Ps scattering from He, Ne, and Ar etc. there will be only
one scattering equation (2) corresponding to total electronic spin S = 1/2. For these targets

ν ′ν and f ±

with doubly occupied spatial orbitals, in the sum over j in Eq. (3) only half of the occupied

target electrons in each sub-shell will contribute when the target is frozen to its ground state
[13]. Consequently, only SN +1,j = 1 (f − and B−) will contribute to target-elastic scattering
[11] for targets with doubly occupied spatial orbitals.

For Ps-H scattering, the diﬀerential cross section is given by dσ/dΩ = [|f +|2 + 3|f −|2]/4.

For target-elastic Ps scattering by He, Ne, and Ar, the diﬀerential cross section is given by
dσ/dΩ = |f −|2. In all Ps-scattering the direct potential, BD, is zero for elastic and all even-

parity-state transitions of Ps. Thus the nonorthogonal exchange kernel alone dominates the

solution of Eq. (2) and this dominance is possibly responsible for convergence diﬃculties to

conventional approaches based on Eq. (2).

The present exchange model was derived using Slater-type orbital for the H-atom, so that a

generalization from a H-target to a complex target represented by a Hatree-Fock wave function

becomes straight-forward. For Ps scattering from a H orbital, the model exchange potential

between the Ps-electron (r2) and the orbital electron (r1) was derived from the 1/r12 term and

is given by [4, 5]:

ν are the binding energies of the ﬁnal target and initial Ps states, respectively,
and C is the only parameter of the potential. Normally, the parameter C is taken to be unity

[4, 5] which leads to reasonably good numerical results. However, it can be varied slightly from

unity to obtain a precise ﬁt of a low-energy scattering observable (experimental or variational),

as have been done in some applications of model potentials [14, 15]. A variation of C from
unity leads to a variation of the binding energy parameters (α2, β 2 etc.) used as average values

for square of momentum [4] in the expression for hDi of Eq. (5). This, in turn, tunes the

strength of the exchange potential (4) at low energies. At high energies this model potential

is insensitive to this parametrization and leads to the well-known Born-Oppenheimer form of

exchange [16]. We have turned this ﬂexibility to good advantage by obtaining precise agreement

with low-energy results of Ps scattering by H, He, Ne, and Ar, as we shall see in the following.

For a complex target the space part of the HF wave function [17] is given by Ψ(r1, r2, ..., rj,-

..., rN ) = A[φ1(r1)φ2(r2)...φj(rj)...φN (rN )], where A is the antisymmetrization operator. The
position vectors of the electrons are ri, i = 1, 2, ..., N and φj’s have the form: φj(rj) =

4

Pκ aκjφκj(rj). The orbital φκj(rj) is a Slater-type orbital. Considering proper antisymmetriza-

tion with respect to Ps and target electrons, the ﬁnal model exchange potential obtained from

(4) is given by [4]

where ακj is the energy parameter corresponding to the orbital φκj(rj) [17].

We use exact wave functions for H and Ps, HF wave functions for He, Ne, and Ar [17]. After

a partial-wave projection, the one-dimensional scattering equations are solved by the method

of matrix inversion.

First we study the eﬀect of the variation of the parameter C of the exchange potential

in the Ps-H system using a three-Ps-state model with Ps(1s,2s,2p) states [7]. We start our

discussion with the singlet S-wave resonance.

In Fig. 1 we plot the S-wave phase shift at

diﬀerent energies which illustrate the resonance pattern obtained with diﬀerent values of C.

The resonance position shifts monotonically towards lower energies with decreasing of C from

unity. We have shown it in steps where the value of C is varied from unity to 0.785. The

resonance position matches with the accurate prediction of 4.01 eV [18] for C = 0.785. In Fig.
2, we plot k cot δ versus k2 for the corresponding low-energy S-wave phase shifts δ. Figure 2

demonstrates how the improvement in the resonance position simultaneously improves the Ps-H

binding energy. For C = 1.0 the resonance and binding energies are 4.715 eV and 0.165 eV,

respectively; for C = 0.9 the corresponding energies are 4.470 eV and 0.445 eV, respectively.

At C = 0.785, while the resonance position is correctly ﬁtted to 4.01 eV (Fig. 1), we obtain

an approximate binding energy of 1.02 eV from a linear extrapolation as in Fig. 2, and 0.99

eV with more precise ﬁtting considering second order corrections, compared to the accurate

prediction of 1.0598 − 1.067 eV [19]. This behavior of the low-energy phase shifts, which yields

simultaneously the Ps-H resonance and binding energies, indicates that the use of the model

potential (4) in a coupled-channel scheme can lead to a good description of Ps-H scattering.

We exhibit in Figs. 3 (a), (b), and (c) the present elastic cross sections, for Ps scattering

by He, (three-Ps-state [4]) Ne and Ar (static-exchange), respectively, for C = 1, 0.85, and

0.785. The value C = 0.785 yielded the good agreement in the case of Ps-H. For the closed-

shell atoms, a typical C close to 0.85 works well for the 3-Ps-state model in Ps-He and for

5

the static-exchange model in Ps-Ar and Ps-Ne. Although the present cross sections diﬀer from

other theoretical [10, 11] and experimental [20] works at low energies for Ps-He (See, Fig. 6 of

Ref. [4]), they agree well with the recent measurements of Skalsey et al. [3] and unpublished

work of G. Peach as quoted in Ref. [2].

In Table I we present the S-wave phase shifts for Ps-Ar (static exchange model denoted

SE), Ps-Ne (SE), and Ps-He (SE and three-Ps-state models) scattering for C = 0.85. In Table

6

II we present the same for the P wave. The magnitude of the scattering lengths, low-energy

cross sections and phase shifts (well below Ps-excitation threshold) increase monotonically as

we move from He to Ne and from Ne to Ar. As the eﬀective potential for elastic scattering

in these cases is repulsive in nature, this indicates an increase in repulsion from He to Ne and

from Ne to Ar.

We ﬁnd from Figs. 3 that the energy-dependences of the elastic cross sections are similar

for all the closed-shell atoms studied here. The cross section has a monotonic slow decrease

with increasing energy. This trend is consistently found in all previous theoretical calculations

in Ps-He. Also, this is expected as the underlying eﬀective potential for elastic scattering is

repulsive in nature.

In conclusion, we have reinvestigated the problem of low-energy elastic Ps scattering by

H, and He (three-Ps-state) using a symmetric nonlocal electron-exchange potential with a

parameter C. We further apply this potential to Ps scattering by Ne, and Ar (static-exchange).

Although the value C = 1 was originally suggested, a slightly lower value C ≈ 0.8 leads to

good agreement with accurate experiment [3] and accurate calculations [18, 19] in the present

cases. Although, a non-symmetric form of the model potential provides a fairly good account

of the cross section [7], we have found that the symmetric form is able to provide a more precise

description of scattering. The Ref.

[4] we have demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of the present

exchange potential in electron-impact scattering. Simplicity of the present exchange potential

and the reliability of the present results calculated with it from a two- (Ps-H) to a 19-electron

(Ps-Ar) system reveals the eﬀectiveness of the exchange model and warrants further study with

it.

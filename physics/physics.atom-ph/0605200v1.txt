We report a frequency measurement of the 1S0 − 3P0 transition of 87Sr atoms in an optical lattice
clock. The frequency is determined to be 429 228 004 229 879 (5) Hz with a fractional uncertainty
that is comparable to state-of-the-art optical clocks with neutral atoms in free fall. Two previous
−13, i.e. almost four times
measurements of this transition were found to disagree by about 2 × 10
the combined error bar, instilling doubt on the potential of optical lattice clocks to perform at a
high accuracy level. In perfect agreement with one of these two values, our measurement essentially
dissipates this doubt.

Recent advances in the ﬁeld of optical

frequency
metrology make measurements with a fractional accu-
racy of 10−17 or better a realistic short term goal [1].
Among other possible applications (e.g. a redeﬁnition of
the S.I. second, optical very long baseline interferome-
try in space, direct mapping of the earth gravitational
using the Einstein eﬀect,...), a very interesting prospect
with measurements at that level is a reproducible test
of Einstein Equivalence Principle by the repeated deter-
mination of the frequency ratio of diﬀerent atomic and
molecular transitions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The topicality of
such a test has recently been renewed by measurements
at the cosmological scale which seem to indicate a slow
variation of the electron to proton mass ratio [8]. The
richness of the test directly depends on the performance
of the clocks that are used but also on the variety of clock
transitions and atomic species on which high accuracy
frequency standards are based.

In that context, optical lattice clocks are expected to
play a central role in the future of this ﬁeld. They use a
large number of atoms conﬁned in the Lamb-Dicke regime
by an optical lattice in which the ﬁrst order perturbation
of the clock transition cancels [9]. Due to the lattice con-
ﬁnement motional eﬀects, which set a severe limitation
to standards with neutral atoms in free fall [10, 11], es-
sentially vanish [12]. This gives hope for a ultimate frac-
tional accuracy better than 10−17. On the other hand,
the large number of atoms in an optical lattice clock
in principle opens the way to a short term fractional
frequency stability signiﬁcantly better than 10−15 τ −1/2
with τ the averaging time in seconds. In this regime the
coherence time of the laser frequency locked to the clock
transition would be several seconds, possibly tens of sec-
onds [25]. Such a long coherence time could for instance
be used to reduce the width of the optical resonances
in single ion clocks down to or below the 0.1 Hz range
opening new prospects for these devices also. Finally,
the optical lattice clock scheme is in principle applica-
ble to a large number of atomic species (Sr, Yb, Hg, Ca,

FIG. 1: Relevant energy levels of 87Sr.

Mg,...) which is a key feature for the fundamental test
discussed above. It is then particularly problematic that
the frequency delivered by the ﬁrst two evaluated opti-
cal lattice clocks, which both use 87Sr, disagree by about
2 × 10−13 [13, 14], i.e. 3.5 times the combined error bar
of the measurements.

We report here a third independent measurement of
the 1S0 − 3P0 transition of 87Sr in an optical lattice clock.
Our measurement turns out to be in excellent agreement
with the one of Ref. [14]. This rules out the explanation
of the previous disagreement by an unexpected large fre-
quency shift which would arise in this new type of clock.
This conclusion is further strengthened by the signiﬁ-
cantly larger trapping potential used here as compared
to that of both previous experiments. We operate the
optical lattice clock with trapping depths ranging from
U0 = 100 Er to U0 = 900 Er, where Er is the recoil en-
ergy associated to the absorption or emission of a lattice
photon (Er/h = 3.58 kHz). We demonstrate that at such
high lattice depths, the residual light shift of the clock
transition is controlled at the Hz level, i.e. in the range
of a few 10−7 of the individual light shift of both involved
atomic states. Including the evaluation of the other sys-

1.2 × 10−14, comparable to state-of-the-art optical fre-
quency standards using neutral atoms in free fall [6, 11].

The Sr optical

lattice clock has been described in
Ref. [15] and we only brieﬂy recall the main features of its
operation time sequence. We ﬁrst load atoms in the ver-
tical 1-D optical lattice operated at its maximum depth,
presently 150 µK. The lattice beam is focused to a 90 µm
waist and goes through a cloud of cold atoms at 2 mK
that is produced by a MOT based on the 1S0 − 1P1 tran-
sition (see the relevant energy levels in Fig. 1). Atoms at
the center of the lattice beam are drained to the 3P0 and
3P2 metastable states by a two-photon optical pumping
scheme using the transitions at 688 nm and 689 nm. This
leads to a continuous loading of the lattice at a rate of a
few 104 atoms/s. After typically 500 ms of loading time,
the MOT and drain lasers are switched oﬀ. Atoms are
repumped back to the 1S0 ground state, and cooled down
to about 10 µK in 60 ms using the narrow 1S0 − 3P1 in-
tercombination transition at 689 nm. Next, the lattice
depth is ramped down in 1 ms and the clock transition is
probed by a beam at 698 nm from an interference-ﬁlter
stabilized extended cavity diode laser [16]. Its emission
spectrum is narrowed by Pound-Drever-Hall locking to
an ultrastable cavity [17, 18]. The probe beam is over-
lapped with the dipole trap and has a waist radius of
210 µm. The transition probability to 3P0 is ﬁnally mea-
sured by detecting successively the populations of both
1S0 and 3P0 states.

The excitation spectrum at 698 nm consists in a nar-
row carrier at the clock transition frequency that is sur-
rounded by motional sidebands detuned by the lattice os-
cillation frequencies. The carrier is displayed in Fig. 2. It
has a width of 50 Hz, for a probe time of 15 ms and a laser
power of 3 µW. The corresponding line Q-factor is about

FIG. 3:
Scheme of the frequency measurement chain : A
698 nm extended cavity laser (ECL) is locked to an ultra-
stable cavity (USC) by a Pound Drever Hall servo loop. The
error signal generated by probing the atoms in the optical
lattice is fed-back to control the frequency of the acousto-
optic modulator (AOM). The femtosecond frequency comb is
used to measure the cavity resonance frequency relative to a
Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillator (CSO) locked to a Hydrogen
MASER. The measurement of the frequency of this oscilla-
tor by the fountain clock FO2 enables referencing to the SI
second.

1013. We observed no dependence of the linewidth on the
depth of the trapping potential (the resonance of Fig. 2
was for U0 = 170 Er). Depending on the depth of the
lattice during the probe pulse the longitudinal oscillation
frequency ranges from 70 kHz to 210 kHz, three orders of
magnitude largeur than the width of the resonance. In
addition the corresponding sidebands are reduced by a
factor η2 [19], with η the Lamb-Dicke parameter ranging
from 0.1 to 0.03 here. The frequency pulling of the carrier
by the longitudinal sidebands is therefore totally negli-
gible. The transverse conﬁnement of the atoms is much
weaker than the longitudinal one and leads to an oscil-
lation frequency between 140 Hz and 410 Hz. Excitation
of the transverse sidebands is possible due to the non-
zero transverse content of the probe wave-vector distri-
bution. This transverse content results from diﬀraction
(the divergence of the probe beam is 1 mrad), the im-
perfection of the probe/lattice alignement and wavefront
aberrations. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2, transverse
sidebands do not emerge from the noise in the experimen-
tal spectrum and are at least 20 times smaller than the
carrier. The corresponding line frequency pulling is less
than 1 Hz.

The frequency measurement chain is depicted in Fig. 3.
The probe beam frequency is locked to the atomic tran-
sition by alternately probing both sides of the carrier
resonance. The diﬀerence between two successive mea-
surements of the transition probability gives the error
signal that is digitally integrated to servo control the fre-
quency of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) used to
bridge the detuning between the atomic transition and
the ultra-stable cavity. The cavity frequency is contin-
uously measured by means of a femtosecond frequency

FIG. 4: Allan deviation of the frequency measurements. The

straight line is a ﬁt by a τ

comb relative to a 1 GHz signal [20, 21]. The latter is
provided by an cryogenic sapphire oscillator [22] that is
locked to a H-maser and referenced to the SI second by
the Cesium fountain clock FO2 with a relative uncer-
tainty in the 10−16 range [23]. The fractional Allan stan-
dard deviation of the measurement is 6 × 10−14 τ −1/2
and is displayed on Fig. 4. The frequency resolution is
therefore 1 Hz (or 2.3 × 10−15 in fractional units) after
about 10 minutes of integration time. The main con-
tributors to the measurement noise are the femtosecond
frequency comb and the strontium clock with roughly
equal weights [26].

The residual ﬁrst order Zeeman eﬀect is the main
source of uncertainty in our measurement. Both clock
levels of total
internal angular momentum F = 9/2
have diﬀerent Land´e factors which correspond to a fre-
quency shift of -0.18 Hz/mG/mF and -0.08 Hz/mG/mF
for 1S0 and 3P0 respectively, with mF the magnetic num-
ber. The measurements are performed at zero magnetic
ﬁeld. Three pairs of Helmholtz coils surround the vacuum
chamber and are used to compensate for the environmen-
tal ﬁeld by minimizing the width of the atomic carrier res-
onance. The cancellation is performed to within 10 mG,
limited by environmental ﬂuctuations. The residual ﬁeld
may result in a systematic frequency shift if there is an
unbalance between the Zeeman sublevels populations or
an asymmetry of the probe laser polarization with respect
to the direction of that ﬁeld. The population asymmetry
is evaluated by measuring the clock frequency as a func-
tion of the depth of the servo-loop frequency modulation.
The results of this test are shown in Fig. 5.(a) for various
values of the angle formed by the probe laser and the
lattice beam polarizations showing no clear dependence
of the clock frequency on these parameters. We conser-
vatively assign an uncertainty of 5 Hz to the ﬁrst order
Zeeman eﬀect. This present limitation to our accuracy
budget is purely technical and can certainly be improved
by orders of magnitude by resolving the Zeeman struc-

ture and using spin-polarized atoms.

The lattice wavelength control is presently performed
with a commercial wavemeter which exhibits long term
ﬂuctuations of the order of 10−3 nm at 813 nm. Tuning
of the lattice to the exact point where the ﬁrst order light
shift cancels is therefore limited to that level and all mea-
surements are performed by interleaving sequences with
diﬀerent lattice depths [15].
In Fig. 5.(b) is shown the
clock frequency as a function of the lattice depth. The
detuning with respect to the magic wavelength deduced
from this particular measurement is 1.1×10−3 nm. At the
average lattice depth U0 = 400 Er, the diﬀerential light
shift is 4.5(9) Hz with an uncertainty which corresponds
to 6 × 10−7 of the individual shift of both clock states.
Note that this evaluation takes into account all contrib-
utors to the atomic dynamic polarizability including the
higher order multipolar terms and the residual vector
and tensor terms in the actual polarization and mag-
netic state conﬁguration [24]. The frequency shift due to
the atomic hyperpolarizability is evaluated by combining
the present measurements with those of Ref. [15]. This
leads to a correction of the measurements by 0.6 Hz at
U0 = 400 Er with an uncertainty equal to the correction.

Finally, we have measured the clock frequency as a
function of the atomic density to check for a possible
frequency shift due to cold collisions in our unpolarized
fermionic sample. This leads to a correction of the clock
frequency of 1(1) Hz at the average atomic density of
about 1011at/cm3.

aThese numbers result from the data of Ref. [15] combined with
new measurements.

The accuracy budget of the Sr optical clock is summa-
rized in table I and gives a total systematic uncertainty of
5 Hz. The weighted average of our measurements which
are plotted in Fig. 6.(a) is 429 228 004 229 879.4 Hz with a
statistical uncertainty of 0.5 Hz. In Fig. 6.(b) are shown
the result of this new measurement together with the
two previously published values of Ref. [13] and Ref. [14].
Our measurement is in excellent agreement with the one
of Ref. [14]. This agreement is a conﬁrmation that op-
tical lattice clocks can indeed operate at a high level of
accuracy.

Today this level is comparable to state-of-the-art opti-
cal clocks with neutral atoms in free fall [6, 11] with ob-
viously large room for improvement. By polarizing the
atoms and using a small bias magnetic ﬁeld, we hope to
be able to decrease by orders of magnitude the uncer-
tainty due to the linear Zeeman eﬀect which is presently
the main contributor to the measurement uncertainty.

The evaluation of the other eﬀects will take advantage of
the unprecedented versatility of this new type of clock. A
large number of operation parameters can be varied such
as the trapping depth and conﬁguration (polarization of
the trapping laser, 1D or 3D lattice), the probe polariza-
tion, the atom number, the interrogation scheme (Rabi or
Ramsey) and duration, etc... This will be of great value
for untangling the various physical eﬀects that contribute
to the uncertainty budget.

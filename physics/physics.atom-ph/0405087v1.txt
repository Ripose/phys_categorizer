Abstract

Energy levels of highly charged ions as a rule cannot be classiﬁed using LS
It is suggested, for optimal
coupling due to rapid increase of relativistic eﬀects.
classiﬁcation of energy spectra, to calculate them in LS coupling and to transform
the weights of the wave functions, obtained after diagonalization of the energy ma-
trix, to the other coupling schemes. F-like ions are considered as an example.

1 Introduction

For optimal classiﬁcation of the energy spectra measured, the collaboration of experi-
menters and theoreticians is required, because only from calculations it is possible to ﬁnd
the closest to reality sets of quantum numbers. The best way to achieve this is found by
calculations of energy spectra in LS coupling and transformation of the weights of the
wave functions, obtained after diagonalization of energy matrix, to the other schemes [1].
Let us consider the energy levels of the conﬁguration 1s22s22p43d J = 5/2 (F-like
isoelectronic sequence, Al V - Ge XXIV) as an example. Let us number them, for Al IV,
J = 5/2, as follows: (3P ) 4D5/2 - 1, (3P ) 4F5/2 - 2, (3P ) 4P5/2 - 3, (3P ) 2F5/2 - 4, (3P ) 2D5/2
- 5, (1D) 2F5/2 - 6, (1D) 2D5/2 - 7, and (1S) 2D5/2 - 8. If, calculating the energy spectra, we
start with most realistic coupling scheme, then the intermediate coupling will not diﬀer
much from the pure one. In such a case one weight will be much larger compared to the
others in the eigenfunction obtained after the diagonalization of the energy matrix. Then
the quantum numbers of this largest weight are used to classify the relevant energy level.
If there are several almost equal weights, then the initial coupling is not suitable and we
have to look for the other coupling schemes. Indeed, e. g., if we look at the classiﬁcation
of the energy levels in Fawcett [2], we shall see that there are cases when the quantum
numbers of the LS coupling can be hardly used for this purpose.

Similar conclusions can be derived from the relevant theoretical studies. Table I
presents the percentage of the largest weights of the levels 2-5 for F-like ions in LS
coupling. It illustrates that with the increase of the ionization degree the accuracy of the
LS coupling worsens. There are even cases when it is impossible to ascribe the largest
weights to certain levels (e.g. levels 2 and 3 for Cr XVI and Mn XVII as well as the levels
2 and 5 for Cu XXI and Zn XXII). Therefore we need a fairly universal methodology of
the classiﬁcation of the levels of atoms and ions with the most reliable sets of quantum
numbers. This is of particular importance for the case of the highly ionized atoms.

2 Methodology

In general we shall follow the methodology of the optimization of the coupling scheme
described in [1, 3]. If we calculate the energy matrix in LS coupling and diagonalize it,
then we arrive at the eigenfunction in the form

Ψ(βJ) = X

αiLiSi

a(αiLiSiJ)Ψ(αiLiSiJ),

where Ψ(αiLiSiJ) is the wave function in the pure LS coupling and a(αiLiSiJ) are the
weights of the wave functions of that coupling. Calculations show that for the level 3
of the V XV the wave function of the intermediate coupling has two practically equal
weights, namely 0.607 and 0.594. Similar situation is also for the levels 3 - 5. Very close
are the weights of the functions Ψ(2p4 (3P ) 3d 2D5/2) and Ψ(2p4 (3P ) 3d 2F5/2) of the
level 2 for Cu XXI, namely 0.518 and 0.514. Mn XIV has two practically equal weights
for level 4, namely a(2p4 (3P ) 3d 2F5/2)=0.633 and a(2p4 (3P ) 3d 4P5/2)=0.635.

There exists the following relationship between the weights of the wave functions of

two pure coupling schemes [1]:

(2)

Here (Ψi | Φk) stands for the transformation matrix from one coupling scheme to the
other. Their general expressions as well as simpliﬁed formulas for special cases may be
also found in [1]. Thus, knowing the weights cik of the wave functions in a certain pure
coupling scheme, let us say LS, we are able to ﬁnd them for the case of any other coupling

aij = X

k

cik(Ψi | Φk).

and to choose in this way the optimal one, avoiding the calculation and the diagonalization
of the energy matrices in other coupling schemes. The relevant procedure is very simple,
particularly when having the necessary computer code. Let us illustrate its practical use
for the optimization of the classiﬁcation of the energy levels 2 and 3 of the F-like ions.
The levels of the conﬁguration 2p4 are classiﬁed using LS coupling whereas four coupling
schemes (LS, LK, JK and JJ) are possible for coupling the angular momenta of 2p4
electrons with those of 3d electron. The energy levels in the LK, JK and JJ coupling
schemes may be denoted as L1[K]J , J1[K]J and [J1J2]J1 correspondingly.

3 Discussion

It turned out that the level 3 for low ionization degrees (Al V - Ar X) may be also classiﬁed
with LK coupling. However LK coupling is extremely unﬁt for Ca XII - Fe XVIII. The
JK coupling is slightly preferable in the middle of the isoelectronic sequence, whereas
JJ coupling at the end. However, for the ionization degrees studied the rather large
deviations from all considered pure coupling schemes including LS are observed.

Mean deviation R of the vectors C of intermediate coupling from pure coupling T

may be also used as the measure of the applicability of coupling scheme (see [3]):

Second equality in (3) is obtained making use of the orthonormality conditions of the
vectors C and T considered in the basis of the same coupling scheme i.e., when tij = δij.
Here jk denotes the largest component of the k-th vector and n = 4. Using the codes
worked out let us calculate R for the levels mentioned above. Considering the weights
of separate levels we see that the validity of one or another coupling scheme varies from
one level to the other. On the contrary, R is an averaged quantity. It reﬂects the main
features of the whole group of the levels.

Figure 1 illustrates the dependence of R on Z for the levels 2-5. Dotted line and
curves with ﬁlled squares, triangles and circles respectively correspond to the LS, LK,
JK and JJ coupling schemes. We see from Figure 1 that the dependence of R on Z
may be devided into three intervals. In the ﬁrst interval Z=12 - 20 LS coupling is the
best. Moreover, at the beginning of the isoelectronic sequence (Z = 12 - 17) it is valid
with high accuracy (R < 0.5) but with the increase of the ionization degree its quality
worsens. In this interval LK coupling occupies the second place, but with the increase of
Z it also worsens whereas the quality of JK coupling improves. Around Sc XIII ion all
three coupling schemes (LS, LK and JK) are practically equally valid (their R values
are respectively equal to 0.693, 0.686 and 0.692). In the second interval (Z = 21 - 26)
the JK coupling is the most suitable. Here R value is decreasing (with the increase of
Z) only for JJ coupling. In the third interval (Z = 28 - 32) the JJ coupling is the best.
Only for it the R value is decreasing with the increase of Z, whereas for the rest three
coupling schemes R is practically the same and at the end (Z = 31, 32) it reaches 0.880.

4 Conclusion

The levels 1, 6 - 8 for Al V - Ge XXIV in the conﬁguration 1s22s22p43d may be fairly
accurately identiﬁed with the help of LS coupling. However, the identiﬁcation of the rest
levels 2 - 5 based on the LS coupling for some ionization stages is doubtful.

Considering the validity of the various coupling schemes for levels 2 - 5, using the
analysis of the structure of the weights of the eigenfunctions or the quantity R, we arrive
at similar conclusions. In both cases we see that at the beginning of the sequence the LS
coupling is valid with high accuracy whereas at its end JJ coupling prevails. Namely, the
optimal classiﬁcation of the levels 2 - 5 would be: LS for Al V - Ca XII, JK for Sc XII -
Co XIX and JJ for the more highly ionized atoms.

The methodology of the optimization of the coupling scheme, based on the transfor-
mation of the weights of a given pure coupling scheme to other couplings and on the
computer codes written, allow us to ﬁnd the optimal coupling scheme for classiﬁcation of
the energy levels of atoms and ions, multiply charged ions included. The methodology
and the codes are fairly universal allowing a study of the complex many-electron con-
ﬁgurations. They may be particularly useful when combined with relevant experimental
studies.

Abstract

Theoretical investigations of the hyperﬁne structure of the hydrogen molecu-
lar ion (one electron and two protons) are discussed. The nuclear spin-rotation
interaction has been found to be of the same sign as in the hydrogen molecule
and the hyperﬁne transition frequencies can be accurately predicted. With
measurements of the hyperﬁne structure of the deuterium molecular ion (or
of HD+) it should be possible to obtain a value of the deuteron quadrupole
moment that could be compared with the values obtained from the deuterium
molecule and from nuclear theory.

INTRODUCTION

2 and nuclear spin I = 1

The calculation of hyperﬁne structure (hfs) frequencies presents a substantial challenge
to theory, in part because the experimental spectroscopic data available are so precise. For
the hydrogen atom in the 1s state, with electron spin S = 1
2 , the
transition frequency between the F = 0 and F = 1 states, where F = I + S, is known
to be 1 420.405 751 766 7(9) MHz [1], in comparison to the most complete theoretical result
of 1 420.405 1(8)MHz [2], which includes reduced mass, QED, and hadronic (mainly proton
recoil and size) eﬀects. Indeed, a simple “Fermi” theory of the hfs (see, for example, [3],
p. 74) with a ﬁxed proton and the electron and proton g-factors of, respectively, 2.002 319
and 5.585 694, gives about 1 422 MHz and with the correction due to the reduced mass
of the proton-electron system it yields 1 420.5 MHz. Further inclusion of the known QED
corrections yields a value of about 1 420.452 MHz [4] and an additional ∼ −45 kHz and
the theoretical error comes from hadronic eﬀects [2]. Needless to say, the diﬃculty of the
calculations increases substantially at each stage [5].

The “hydrogen atom” of molecular physics is the hydrogen molecular ion H2

+ consisting
of two protons bound by a single electron. From a theoretical point of view this molecule
oﬀers a good starting point for investigations of molecular hfs since the electronic wave func-
tion can be calculated to high accuracy. Surprisingly, there have been only a few experiments
on the hfs of H2

+ [6–8], one experiment on HD+ [9,10] , and no experiments on D2

+.

With the deuterated ions it should be possible to determine the electric quadrupole mo-
ment of the deuteron, once the hfs transition energies are measured, and a further discussion
of the prospects of using D2

+ to do this will be given below.

THEORY OF H2

+ HFS

As with the hydrogen atom, the hfs in H2

+ arises primarily from interactions between
the electron spin and nuclear spin, but there are also smaller magnetic eﬀects arising from
the electron and nuclear spins interacting with the magnetic ﬁeld of the rotating nucleus.

The hfs energy can be described by the eﬀective spin Hamiltonian

Hhfs = bI · S + cIzSz + dS · N + f I · N,

(1)

where I, S, and N are, respectively, the total nuclear spin, electron spin, and rotational
angular momenta, and b, c, d, and f are the coupling constants. Transition frequencies
are obtained by diagonalizing the matrix elements of (1) with constants calculated from
theoretical expressions or if given measured frequencies the constants can be determined
by ﬁtting using matrix elements of (1); usually the bβS [11] angular momentum coupling
scheme is used in which the intermediate vector F2 = I + S is formed, and then the total
F = F2 + N.

Early theoretical studies of H2

+ hfs were motivated by a need for predictions of transi-
tion frequencies of the N = 1 rotational level of the v = 0 vibrational state for astrophysical
searches (it is now believed that there is little prospect for detection, cf. [12]), because no
experimental data were available. The researchers calculated coupling constants and tran-
sition frequencies using (1) with f = 0. Transition frequencies were estimated by Burke [13]

using calculations of b, c, and d, and by Mizushima [14] who used values of b and c calculated
by Stephens and Auﬀray [15]. A signiﬁcant advance in the theory was the derivation by
Dalgarno, Patterson, and Somerville [16] of the b, c, and d terms of (1) from the Dirac eq
+ by a nonrelativistic reduction within the Breit-Pauli approximation. They demon-
for H2
strated that d could be written d = d1 + d2, where d1 is the electron spin-rotational magnetic
interaction and d2 is a second-order term in the electronic wave function. They calculated
values for b, c, and d1, estimated d2, and calculated transition frequencies and the constants
b and c were used by Richardson, Jeﬀerts, and Dehmelt to make the ﬁrst experimental esti-
mate of d [6]. Further improvements in calculations of b, c, and d1, and improved estimates
of d2 were presented by Somerville [17,18] and by Luke [19]. The second-order constant
d2 was calculated accurately using a variation-perturbation method by Kalaghan and Dal-
garno [20] and by McEachran, Veenstra, and Cohen [21], who also calculated b, c, and d1
and accurate transition frequencies.

The calculated constants discussed so far were all determined in the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation in which the electron is assumed to move in the ﬁeld generated by averag-
ing over the electronic wave function. Nonadiabatic eﬀects on the ground electronic state
through the excitation of other electronic states due to the coupling of electronic and nuclear
motion contribute signiﬁcantly to the constant b and the eﬀects of the reduced mass of the
electron on the constants have been treated [22,23].

The nuclear spin-rotation term f was introduced into the eﬀective spin Hamiltonian (1)
on phenomenological grounds by Jeﬀerts [7], who measured the hfs transition frequencies
for the v = 4–8 vibrational states. For the N = 1 rotational level for each v, he obtained
values of the constants by ﬁtting to (1). Varshalovich and Sannikov [12] obtained diﬀerent
ﬁts to Jeﬀerts’ data, notably, they found the value of f to be negative. The ﬁrst (and to
date the only) measurements of the hfs of the N = 1 level of v = 0 state were carried out
by Fu, Hessels, and Lundeen [8] through spectroscopy of high angular momentum Rydberg
states of the hydrogen molecule H2 and by ﬁtting the measured Rydberg transition levels to
an eﬀective spin Hamiltonian including (1) they determined values for b, c, d, and f .

A recent theoretical study of the nuclear spin-rotation interaction in H2
of f to be negative [24]. The nuclear spin-rotation interaction can be written

+ found the sign

f (R) = f1(R) + f2(R),

and the major contributions [25] to the energy hf are from the interaction of each nuclear
magnetic moment with the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the other rotating nucleus,
hf1(R) = −4gpµ2

and with the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the orbiting electron [26],

where in atomic units R is the internuclear distance, µN is the nuclear magneton, and the
dimensionless quantities α, gp, and σhf are, respectively, the fs constant, the proton g-factor
deﬁned previously, and the high-frequency component of the magnetic shielding constant as
deﬁned in Eq. (3) of [24].

In Table I values of the hfs constants calculated as in [23] and the nuclear spin-rotation
constants calculated as in [24], averaged over the vibrational wave functions, are compared
with constants measured [8] for the N = 1 level of the v = 0 state and with constants
determined [12] from the measurements [7] on the N = 1 level of the vibrational state v = 4.
The agreement between theory and experiment is impressive—the theoretical constants in
Table I reproduce all measured transition frequencies to within 175 kHz. The formalism
of [23] accounts for reduced mass eﬀects on the hfs constants but not fully for radiative and
relativistic eﬀects.

DEUTERON MOLECULAR ION

The electric quadrupole moment Q of the deuteron can serve as a sensitive test of models
of the neutron-proton nuclear force [27]. The most accurate determination Q = 0.2860 ±
0.0015 × 10−26cm2 was obtained semiempirically from measurements [28] of the magnetic hfs
of the deuterium molecule D2 through a theoretical value for the electric ﬁeld gradient at the
nucleus due to the other constituent charges of the molecule [29,30]. It should be possible
+, which has the theoretical advantage of a simpler
to measure Q semiempirically using D2
electronic structure than D2, thereby facilitating accurate computation, but to date there
+. (An experiment that measured hfs levels of
have been no measurements of the hfs of D2
HD+ was reported, but the quadrupole eﬀects were not resolved [9].)

For D2

+, the eﬀective spin Hamiltonian is (1) plus an additional nuclear quadrupole
interaction [31] proportional to eqQ, where e is the proton charge and q is the electric ﬁeld
gradient. Predictions of the hfs constants and electric quadrupole coupling constant for the
+ are given in Table II. The constants b, c, and d
N = 1 level of the v = 0 state of D2
have been calculated as in [23] with the inclusion of nonadiabatic eﬀects in b and c, and f
has been calculated using the theory of [24]. The term eqQ was estimated by calculating
q in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and using the semi-empirical value of Q from
D2. More detailed calculations of the hfs constants, quadrupole coupling constants, and
transition frequencies will be reported [32].

The quadrupole coupling constant is about 57 kHz, see Table II. The experimental
+ was better than 3 kHz [7], in the
precision achieved in the ion trap experiments on H2
Rydberg H2 experiment it was around 20 kHz [8], and in a laser-rf double-resonance ion
+ it was better than 10 kHz [33]. It would appear that the prospects are
beam study of N2
good for measuring the deuteron quadrupole moment using D2

+.

Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation is a sensitive technique for measuring magnetic ﬁelds. Here,
the shot-noise-limited magnetometric sensitivity is analyzed for the case of optically-thick media and
high light power, which has been the subject of recent experimental and theoretical investigations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Resonant nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR)
[1, 2] has been the subject of extensive theoretical and
experimental studies because it provides a very sensitive
way to measure magnetic ﬁelds (see, e.g., Ref. [3]). While
NMOR experiments are usually carried out with vapor
samples of moderate optical thickness (no more than
2
absorption lengths), the intense research of recent years
on electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT; see,
e.g., Ref. [4] for a review) has motivated investigation of
optically thick media [5, 6].

Recently, NMOR in the vicinity of the D1 and D2
lines by an optically thick vapor of rubidium was stud-
ied [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The authors of Ref. [8] used a
5 cm-long vapor cell containing 87Rb and a laser beam
tuned to the maximum of the NMOR spectrum near the
D1 line (laser power was 2.5 mW, beam diameter
2
mm). They measured maximum (with respect to laser
frequency and magnetic ﬁeld) polarization rotation ϕmax
as a function of atomic density. It was found that ϕmax

increases essentially linearly up to n
At higher densities, dϕmax/dn decreases and eventually
becomes negative. The maximum observed rotation was
0.6 G.

(This shows the eﬀect of power broadening on the mag-
netic ﬁeld dependence; at low light power, the maximum
rotation would occur at a magnetic ﬁeld about an order of
B=0, an im-
magnitude smaller.) Rotation slope dϕ/dB

as a function of atomic density in Ref. [8].

The goal of the present contribution is to analyze the
scaling of optimal magnetometric sensitivity with respect
to optical thickness of the sample. We analyze NMOR
for a simple system—an isolated J = 1
J = 0 transi-
tion—for which analytical solutions for the density ma-
trix are readily obtained. We assume that the transverse
thickness of the sample is small, so that the trapping of
spontaneously-emitted radiation can be neglected. (This
assumption may not be justiﬁed in actual experiments
with optically thick media [9].) We also neglect mix-

ing between diﬀerent velocity groups due to velocity-
changing collisions. Such mixing is important in the pres-
ence of a buﬀer gas, or for anti-relaxation-coated cells.

A theoretical treatment of NMOR in dense media has
been carried out earlier in Refs. [7] and [12]. The present
analysis partially overlaps with this earlier work and ex-
tends it in several ways: we extend the treatment to
the case of large Doppler broadening and the interme-
diate regime where power and Doppler widths are com-
parable; provide a qualitative discussion of the contribu-
tion to optical rotation as a function of optical depth in
the medium; discuss the role of the coherence and the
alignment-to-orientation conversion eﬀects [13]; discuss
scaling of magnetometric sensitivity with optical thick-
ness of the medium; and ﬁnally, give a general argument
on scaling based on the observation that an optimized
nonlinear optical rotation measurement is a way to carry
out a spin measurement of an atomic ensemble with sensi-
tivity given by fundamental quantum noise limits [3, 12].

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE DENSITY MATRIX
CALCULATION

The calculation is based on a standard density matrix
approach. The time evolution of the atomic density ma-
trix ρ is given by the Liouville equation (see, e.g., Ref.

absorption, rotation, phase shift, and change of elliptic-
ity per unit distance for an optically thin medium can
be found in terms of the density matrix elements (these
expressions are given in Ref. [17]). Once the solutions
for the density matrix are obtained, we will perform an
integration to generalize the result to media of arbitrary
thickness.

III. THE DOPPLER-FREE CASE

We consider the case of a J = 1

J = 0 transi-
tion, and linearly-polarized incident light, with a mag-
netic ﬁeld directed along the light propagation direction
(Faraday geometry). Using the rotating wave approxima-
tion, the solution of Eq. (1) is obtained, and from this,
analytic expressions for thin medium absorption and ro-
tation are found. These expressions can be simpliﬁed by
assuming that γ

We now generalize the formulas for absorption and
rotation to the case of thick media, and ﬁnd the mag-
netometric sensitivity.
In the Doppler-free case we are
presently considering, we can further simplify the ex-
pressions by assuming ∆ = 0 (we will have to include
non-zero detunings in the discussion of the Doppler-
broadened case below), and κ
1. (We will see from
the ﬁnal result that this holds everywhere in the medium
when the input light power is optimal.) Generally, the
medium in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld produces light
ellipticity as well as rotation; however, the ellipticity is
an odd function of detuning and is zero on resonance.
The rate of change of the saturation parameter as light
travels through the medium is given by

This contribution is plotted as a function of position in
Fig. 1. The plot illustrates that the part of the medium
near its end contributes signiﬁcantly more to the overall
rotation than the part near its beginning. This is because
light power, and correspondingly, the light broadening of
the resonance, is lower at the end of the medium [the
ratio of the rotation per unit length is approximately
(3/2)α0ℓ/κ0]. Integrating over the length

This result is consistent with the general observation [3]
that optimized NMOR provides a method for measuring
a spin-system at the standard quantum limit (SQL) given
by spin-projection noise [23]. The sensitivity is then ex-
pected to scale as the square root of the product of the
number of available atoms and the spin-relaxation time
(see, e.g., Ref. [18], Sec. 3.1.1), which is indeed the result
(18).

IV. THE DOPPLER-BROADENED CASE

Now we consider the case where the Doppler width Γ
is much greater than the power-broadened line width. In
this case, we need to average over the over the atomic ve-
locity distribution, which is equivalent to averaging over
the Doppler-free spectral proﬁles. On resonance with the
Doppler broadened transition, the absorption coeﬃcient
is given by

Note that the behavior of the saturation parameter as a

case compared to the Doppler-free case [cf. Eq. (14)]
where the saturation parameter falls approximately lin-
early with distance.

We see that the rotation per unit length scales as 1/√κ,
in contrast to the 1/κ scaling for the Doppler-free case
[similar to the situation with absorption, Eqs. (7,19)].
This is because the number of atoms producing the eﬀect
is, in a sense, not ﬁxed; with increasing light power, a
larger fraction of the Doppler distribution is involved.

the Doppler-free case [Eq. (15)].

tical depth in Fig. 4, for the same parameters as used
for Fig. 3. The rotation initially rises linearly, the same
behavior seen in the experiment [8] mentioned in the in-
troduction. For large optical depth, however, rotation in
Fig. 4 then begins to rise more quickly, and ﬁnally satu-
rates, whereas experimentally a slower increase and then
a decrease in rotation is seen. This is evidence for an ad-
ditional relaxation mechanism not accounted for in the
present theory; in Ref. [8] it is attributed to the eﬀect of
radiation trapping.

sitivity is not as high as could be achieved with low
12 G/√Hz
atomic density paraﬃn-coated cells (
[3]), it is, nevertheless, suﬃciently high to be of interest
in practical applications [10]. In particular, the power-
broadening of the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of optical
rotation at high light power provides an increased dy-
namic range for magnetometry over the low-power case.
There are, however, techniques for shifting the narrow
resonance obtained with a paraﬃn-coated cell to higher
magnetic ﬁelds, e.g., frequency modulation of the laser
light [20].

VI. LARGE-FIELD OPTICAL ROTATION

The maximum optical rotation with respect to mag-
netic ﬁeld can be determined with a numerical calcula-

In conclusion, we have analyzed magnetometric sen-
sitivity of NMOR measurements optimized with respect
to light intensity in the case of negligible Doppler broad-
ening, and in the case of large Doppler broadening. In
the former case, we ﬁnd that the sensitivity improves as
the square root of optical density, while in the latter, it
improves linearly. In the present discussion, we have ne-
glected the eﬀect of velocity-changing collisions, which
makes this analysis not directly applicable to buﬀer-gas
and anti-relaxation-coated cells. However, since there is
full mixing between velocity components in these cells,
one can expect that the sensitivity should scale as square
root of optical density (if this quantity can be varied in-
dependently of the ground state relaxation rate).

[22] In the general case, there may exist an additional source
of noise due to AC-Stark shift associated with oﬀ-
resonant levels [12]; however, this source of noise is absent
for an isolated transition such as the one considered here.
[23] The use of so-called spin-squeezed quantum states of light
(see, e.g., Ref. [21] and references therein) can, in prin-
ciple, allow one to overcome the SQL. We consider only
non-squeezed states of atoms and light here.

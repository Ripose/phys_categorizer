Measurement of the sensitivity function in
time-domain atomic interferometer

Abstract

We present here an analysis of the sensitivity of a time-domain atomic interferometer to
the phase noise of the lasers used to manipulate the atomic wave-packets. The sensitivity
function is calculated in the case of a three pulse Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which is the
conﬁguration of the two inertial sensors we are building at BNM-SYRTE. We successfully
compare this calculation to experimental measurements. The sensitivity of the interferometer
is limited by the phase noise of the lasers, as well as by residual vibrations. We evaluate
the performance that could be obtained with state of the art quartz oscillators, as well as
the impact of the residual phase noise of the phase-lock loop. Requirements on the level of
vibrations is derived from the same formalism.

ATOM optics is a mean to realize precision measurements in various ﬁelds. Atomic

microwave clocks are the most precise realization of a SI unit, the second [1], and high
sensitivity inertial sensors [2], [3], [4], based on atomic interferometry [5], already reveal
accuracies comparable with state of the art sensors [6], [7]. Two cold atom inertial sensors
are currently under construction at BNM-SYRTE , a gyroscope [8] which already reaches a
1/2, and an absolute gravimeter [9] which will be used
sensitivity of 2.5 × 10−
in the BNM Watt Balance project [10]. Although based on diﬀerent atoms and geometries,
the atomic gyroscope and gravimeter rely on the same principle, which is presented in ﬁgure
1. Atoms are collected in a three dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D-MOT) in which the
atoms are cooled down to a few µK. In the gyroscope, 133Cs atoms are launched upwards
with an angle of 8˚ with respect to verticality using the technic of moving molasses, whereas
in the gravimeter, 87Rb atoms are simply let to fall. Then the initial quantum state is
prepared by a combination of microwave and optical pulses. The manipulation of the atoms
is realized by stimulated Raman transition pulses [11], using two counter-propagating lasers,
which drive coherent transitions between the two hyperﬁne levels of the alkali atom. Three
laser pulses, of durations τR − 2τR − τR, separated in time by T , respectively split, redirect
and recombine the atomic wave-packets, creating an atomic interferometer [12]. Finally, a
ﬂuorescence detection gives a measurement of the transition probability from one hyperﬁne
level to the other, which is given by P = 1
2(1 − cos(Φ)), Φ being the interferometric phase.
The phase diﬀerence between the two Raman lasers (which we will call the Raman phase
throughout this article, and denote φ) is printed at each pulse on the phase of the atomic

wave function [13]. As φ depends on the position of the atoms, the interferometer is sensitive
to inertial forces, and can thus measure rotation rates and accelerations. A drawback of this
technic is that the measurement of the interferometric phase is aﬀected by the phase noise
of the Raman lasers, as well as parasitic vibrations. The aim of this article is to investigate
both theoretically and experimentally how these noise sources limit the sensitivity of such
an atomic interferometer.

Fig. 1
Scheme of principle of our inertial sensors, illustrated for the gyroscope experiment.
Cold atoms from the 3D-MOT are launched upwards and a pure quantum state is
selected. At the top of their trajectory, we apply three Raman laser pulses realizing
the interferometer. Finally a fluorescence detection allows to measure the transition
probability. Such an interferometer is sensitive to the rotation (Ω) perpendicular to the
area enclosed between the two arms and to the acceleration along the laser’s axis.

II. sensitivity function

The sensitivity function is a natural tool to characterize the inﬂuence of the ﬂuctuations
in the Raman phase φ on the transition probability [14], and thus on the interferometric
phase. Let’s assume a phase jump δφ occurs on the Raman phase φ at time t during the
interferometer sequence, inducing a change of δP (δφ, t) in the transition probability. The

3

sensitivity function is then deﬁned by :

.

The sensitivity function can easily be calculated for inﬁnitesimally short Raman pulses.
In this case, the interferometric phase Φ can be deduced from the Raman phases φ1,φ2,φ3 dur-
ing the three laser interactions, taken at the position of the center of the atomic wavepacket:
Φ = φ1 − 2φ2 + φ3 [15]. Usually, the interferometer is operated at Φ = π/2, for which
the transition probability is 1/2, to get the highest sensitivity to interferometric phase
If the phase step δφ occurs for instance between the ﬁrst and the second
ﬂuctuations.
pulses, the interferometric phase changes by δΦ = −δφ, and the transition probability by
δP = −cos(π/2 + δΦ)/2 ∼ −δφ/2 in the limit of an inﬁnitesimal phase step. Thus, in
between the ﬁrst two pulses, the sensitivity function is -1. The same way, one ﬁnds for the
sensitivity function between the last two pulses : +1.

In the general case of ﬁnite duration Raman laser pulses, the sensitivity function depends
on the evolution of the atomic state during the pulses. In order to calculate g(t), we make
several assumptions. First, the laser waves are considered as pure plane waves. The atomic
motion is then quantized in the direction parallel to the laser beams. Second, we restrict
our calculation to the case of a constant Rabi frequency (square pulses). Third, we assume
the resonance condition is fulﬁlled. The Raman interaction then couples the two states
|ai = |g1, −→p i and |bi = |g2, −→p + ~−→
k ef f i where |g1i and |g2i are the two hyperﬁne levels
−→
of the ground state, −→p is the atomic momentum,
k ef f is the diﬀerence between the wave
vectors of the two lasers.

We develop the atomic wave function on the basis set {|ai, |bi} so that |Ψ(t)i = Ca(t)|ai+
Cb(t)|bi, and choose the initial state to be |Ψ(ti)i = |Ψii = |ai. At the output of the
interferometer, the transition probability is given by P = |Cb(tf )|2, where tf = ti + 2T + 4τR.
The evolution of Ca and Cb from ti to tf is given by

where M is the evolution matrix through the whole interferometer. Solving the Schr¨odinger
equation gives the evolution matrix during a Raman pulse [16], from time t0 to time t:

where ΩR/2π is the Rabi frequency and ωL, the eﬀective frequency, is the frequency diﬀerence
between the two lasers, ωL = ω2 − ω1. Setting ΩR = 0 in Mp(t0, t, ΩR, φ) gives the free
evolution matrix, which determines the evolution between the pulses. The evolution matrix
for the full evolution is obtained by taking the product of several matrices. When t occurs
during the i − th laser pulse, we split the evolution matrix of this pulse at time t into two
successive matrices, the ﬁrst one with φi, and the second one with φ = φi + δφ.

CHEINET et al.: MEASUREMENT OF THE SENSITIVITY FUNCTION IN ...

Finally, we choose the time origin at the middle of the second Raman pulse. We thus
have ti = −(T + 2τR) and tf = T + 2τR. We then calculate the change in the transition
probability for a inﬁnitesimally small phase jump at any time t during the interferometer,
and deduce g(t). It is an odd function, whose expression is given here for t > 0:

g(t) =

sin(ΩRt)
1
− sin(ΩR(T − t)) T + τR < t < T + 2τR

0 < t < τR
τR < t < T + τR

(

(4)

When the phase jump occurs outside the interferometer, the change in the transition

probability is null, so that g(t) = 0 for |t| > T + 2τR.

In order to validate this calculation, we use the gyroscope experiment to measure experi-
mentally the sensitivity function. About 108 atoms from a background vapor are loaded in a
3D-MOT within 125 ms, with 6 laser beams tuned to the red of the F = 4 → F ′ = 5 transi-
tion at 852 nm. The atoms are then launched upwards at ∼ 2.4 m/s within 1 ms, and cooled
down to an eﬀective temperature of ∼ 2.4µK. After launch, the atoms are prepared into the
|F = 3, mF = 0i state using a combination of microwave and laser pulses : they ﬁrst enter a
selection cavity tuned to the |F = 4, mF = 0i → |F = 3, mF = 0i transition. The atoms left
in the F = 4 state are pushed away by a laser beam tuned to the F = 4 → F ′ = 5 transition,
11 cm above the selection cavity. The selected atoms then reach the apogee 245 ms after
the launch, where they experience three interferometer pulses of duration τR − 2τR − τR
with τR = 20 µs separated in time by T = 4.97 ms. The number of atoms NF =3 and NF =4
are ﬁnally measured by detecting the ﬂuorescence induced by a pair of laser beams located
7 cm below the apogee. From these measurements, we deduce the transition probability
NF =4/(NF =3 + NF =4). The total number of detected atoms is about 105. The repetition rate
of the experiment is 2 Hz.

The set-up for the generation of the two Raman laser beams is displayed in ﬁgure 2.
Two slave diode lasers of 150 mW output power are injected with extended cavity diode
lasers. The polarizations of the slave diodes output beams are made orthogonal so that the
two beams can be combined onto a polarization beam splitter cube. The light at this cube
is then split in two distinct unbalanced paths.

On the ﬁrst path, most of the power of each beam is sent through an optical ﬁber
to the vacuum chamber. The two beams are then collimated with an objective attached
onto the chamber (waist w0 = 15 mm). They enter together through a viewport, cross the
atomic cloud, and are ﬁnally retroreﬂected by a mirror ﬁxed outside the vacuum chamber.
In this geometry, four laser beams are actually sent onto the atoms, which interact with
only two of them, because of selection rules and resonance conditions. The interferometer
can also be operated with co-propagating Raman laser beams by simply blocking the light
in front of the retroreﬂecting mirror. A remarkable feature of this experiment is that the
three interferometer pulses are realized by this single pair of Raman lasers that is turned on
and oﬀ three times, the middle pulse being at the top of the atoms’ trajectory. For all the
measurements described in this article, the Raman lasers are used in the co − propagating
conﬁguration. The interferometer is then no longer sensitive to inertial forces, but remains
sensitive to the relative phase of the Raman lasers. Moreover, as such Raman transitions
are not velocity selective, more atoms contribute to the signal. All this allows us to reach a

Principle of the laser phase-lock: the beatnote at 9.192 GHz between the two Raman
lasers is observed on a fast response photodetector. After amplification, this beatnote
is mixed with the reference frequency at 9.392 GHz from the frequency chain, to obtain a
signal at 200 MHz. This signal is compared with the reference frequency at 200 MHz from
the same frequency chain to get an error signal. This error signal is then processed and
sent to the current of the laser and to the PZT that controls the laser cavity length.

good signal to noise ratio of 150 per shot.

The second path is used to control the Raman lasers phase diﬀerence, which needs to be
locked [17] onto the phase of a very stable microwave oscillator. The phase lock loop scheme
is also displayed in ﬁgure 2. The frequency diﬀerence is measured by a fast photodetector,
which detects a beatnote at 9.192 GHz. This signal is then mixed with the signal of a
Dielectric Resonator Oscillator (DRO) tuned at 9.392 GHz. The DRO itself is phase locked
onto the 94th harmonics of a very stable 100 MHz quartz. The output of the mixer (IF)
is 200 MHz. A local oscillator (LO) at 200 MHz is generated by doubling the same 100
MHz quartz. IF and LO are compared using a digital phase and frequency detector, whose
output is used as the error signal of the phase-locked loop. The relative phase of the lasers is
stabilized by reacting on the current of one of the two diode lasers, as well as on the voltage
applied to the PZT that controls the length of the extended cavity diode laser [17].

To measure g(t), a small phase step of δφ = 0.107 rad is applied at time t on the
local oscillator. The phase lock loop copies this phase step onto the Raman phase within
a fraction of µs, which is much shorter than the Raman pulse duration of τR = 20 µs.
Finally we measured the transition probability as a function of t and deduced the sensitivity
function. We display in ﬁgure 3 the measurement of the sensitivity function compared with
the theoretical calculation. We also realized a precise measurement during each pulse and
clearly obtained the predicted sinusoidal rise of the sensitivity function.

For a better agreement of the experimental data with the theoretical calculation, the
data are normalized to take into account the interferometer’s contrast, which was measured

to be 78%. This reduction in the contrast with respect to 100% is due to the combined eﬀect
of inhomogeneous Rabi frequencies between the atoms, and unbalanced Rabi frequencies
between the pulses. Indeed, the atomic cloud size of 8 mm is not negligible with respect to
the size of the single pair of Raman gaussian beams, w0 = 15 mm. Atoms at both sides of
the atomic cloud will not see the same intensity, inducing variable transfer eﬃciency of the
Raman transitions. Moreover, the cloud moves by about 3 mm between the ﬁrst and the
last pulse. In order for the cloud to explore only the central part of the gaussian beams,
we choose a rather small interaction time of T = 4.97 ms with respect to the maximum
interaction time possible of T = 40 ms. Still, the quantitative agreement is not perfect.
One especially observes a signiﬁcant asymmetry of the sensitivity function, which remains
to be explained. A full numerical simulation could help in understanding the eﬀect of the
experimental imperfections.

III. Transfer Function of the interferometer

From the sensitivity function, we can now evaluate the ﬂuctuations of the interferometric

phase Φ for an arbitrary Raman phase noise φ(t) on the lasers

The transfer function of the interferometer can be obtained by calculating the response
of the interferometer phase Φ to a sinusoidal modulation of the Raman phase, given by
φ(t) = A0cos(ω0t + ψ). We ﬁnd δΦ = A0ω0Im(G(ω0))cos(ψ), where G is the Fourier
transform of the sensitivity function.

When averaging over a random distribution of the modulation phase ψ, the rms value
of the interferometer phase is δΦrms = |A0ω0G(ω0)|. The transfer function is thus given
by H(ω) = ωG(ω). If we now assume uncorrelated Raman phase noise between successive
measurements, the rms standard deviation of the interferometric phase noise σrms
is given
by:

The weighting function |H(2πf )|2 versus the frequency f is displayed in ﬁgure 4.
It
has two important features: the ﬁrst one is an oscillating behavior at a frequency given by
1/(T + 2τR), leading to zeros at frequencies given by fk = k
T +2τR . The second is a low pass
ﬁrst order ﬁltering due to the ﬁnite duration of the Raman pulses, with an eﬀective cutoﬀ
frequency f0, given by f0 = √3

displayed on the ﬁgure.

In order to measure the transfer function, a phase modulation Amcos(2πfmt + ψ) is
applied on the Raman phase, triggered on the ﬁrst Raman pulse. The interferometric phase
variation is then recorded as a function of fm. We then repeat the measurements for the phase
modulation in quadrature Amsin(2πfmt + ψ). From the quadratic sum of these measurement,
we extract H(2πfm)2. The weighting function was ﬁrst measured at low frequency. The
results, displayed in ﬁgure 5 together with the theoretical value, clearly demonstrate the

slightly above the cutoﬀ frequency, and shows two zeros. The ﬁrst one corresponds to a
frequency multiple of 1/(T + 2τ ). The second one is a zero of the last factor of equation 8.
Its position depends critically on the value of the Rabi frequency.

When comparing the data with the calculation, the experimental imperfections already
mentioned have to be accounted for. An eﬀective Rabi frequency Ωef f can be deﬁned by the
relation Ωef f τ0 = π, where τ0 is the duration of the single pulse, performed at the center
of the gaussian Raman beams, that optimizes the transition probability. For homogeneous
Raman beams, this pulse would be a π pulse. This eﬀective Rabi frequency is measured with
an uncertainty of about 1 %. It had to be corrected by only 1.5 % in order for the theoretical
and experimental positions of the second zero to match. The excellent agreement between
the theoretical and experimental curves validate our model.

the experimental measurement are in good agreement with the theoretical calculation.

Allan variance is equal, within a factor of two, to the variance of the diﬀerences in the
successive average values ¯δΦk of the interferometric phase. Our interferometer being operated
sequentially at a rate fc = 1/Tc, τ is a multiple of Tc : τ = mTc. Without loosing generality,
we can choose tk = −Tc/2 + kmTc. The average value ¯δΦk can now be expressed as

Equation 17 shows that the sensitivity of the interferometer is limited by an aliasing phe-
nomenon similar to the Dick eﬀect in atomic clocks [14] : only the phase noise at multiple of
the cycling frequency appear in the Allan variance, weighted by the Fourier components of
the transfer function.

In that case, the sensitivity of the interferometer depend not only on the Raman phase noise
spectral density but also on the pulse duration τR. For a better sensitivity, one should use
the largest pulse duration as possible. But, as the Raman transitions are velocity selective,
a very long pulse will reduce the number of useful atoms. This increases the detection noise
contribution, so that there is an optimum value of τR that depends on the experimental
parameters. In the case of the gyroscope, the optimum was found to be τR = 20 µs.

(18)

To reach a good sensitivity, the Raman phase needs to be locked to the phase of a
very stable microwave oscillator (whose frequency is 6.834 GHz for 87Rb and 9.192 GHz for
133Cs). This oscillator can be generated by a frequency chain, where low phase noise quartz
performances are transposed in the microwave domain. At low frequencies (f < 10−100 Hz),
the phase noise spectral density of such an oscillator is usually well approximated by a 1/f 3
power law (ﬂicker noise), whereas at high frequency (f > 1 kHz), it is independent of the
frequency (white noise). Using equation 17 and the typical parameters of our experiments
(τR = 20 µs and T = 50 ms), we can calculate the phase noise spectral density required to
achieve an interferometric phase ﬂuctuation of 1 mrad per shot. This is equivalent to the
quantum projection noise limit for 106 detected atoms. The ﬂicker noise of the microwave
oscillator should be lower than −53 dB.rad2.Hz−
1 at 1 Hz from the carrier frequency, and
its white noise below −111 dB.rad2.Hz−
1. Unfortunately, there exists no quartz oscillator
combining these two levels of performance. Thus, we plan to lock a SC Premium 100
MHz oscillator (from Wenzel Company) onto a low ﬂicker noise 5 MHz Blue Top oscillator
(Wenzel). From the speciﬁcations of these quartz, we calculate a contribution of 1.2 mrad
to the interferometric phase noise.

Phase ﬂuctuations also arise from residual noise in the servo-lock loop. We have mea-
sured experimentally the residual phase noise power spectral density of a phase lock system

analogous to the one described in ﬁgure 2. This system has been developed for phase locking
the Raman lasers of the gravimeter experiment. The measurement was performed by mixing
IF and LO onto an independent RF mixer, whose output phase ﬂuctuations was analyzed
onto a Fast Fourier Transform analyzer. The result of the measurement is displayed on ﬁgure
7. At low frequencies, below 100 Hz, the phase noise of our phaselock system lies well below
the required ﬂicker noise. After a few kHz, it reaches a plateau of −119 dB.rad2.Hz−
1. The
amplitude of this residual noise is not limited by the gain of the servo loop. Above 60 kHz,
it increases up to −90 dB.rad2.Hz−
1 at 3.5 MHz, which is the bandwidth of our servo lock
loop. Using equation 17, we evaluated to 0.72 mrad its contribution to the interferometer’s
phase noise.

Phase noise power spectral density between the two phase locked diode lasers. Up to
100 kHz, we display the residual noise of the phaselock loop, obtained by measuring the
phase noise of the demodulated beatnote on a Fast Fourier Transform analyzer. There,
the phase noise of the reference oscillator is rejected. Above 100 kHz, we display the
phase noise measured directly on the beatnote observed onto a spectrum analyzer. In
this case, the reference oscillator phase noise limits the Raman phase noise to

V. The case of parasitic vibrations

The same formalism can be used to evaluate the degradation of the sensitivity caused by
parasitic vibrations in the usual case of counter-propagating Raman beams. As the two laser
beams are ﬁrst overlapped before being sent onto the atoms, their phase diﬀerence is mostly
aﬀected by the movements of a single optical element, the mirror that ﬁnally retro-reﬂects
them.

A displacement of this mirror by δz induces a Raman phase shift of kef f δz. The sensi-

tivity of the interferometer is then given by

where Sz(ω) is the power spectral density of position noise. Introducing the power spectral

It is important to note here that the acceleration noise is severely ﬁltered by the transfer
function for acceleration which decreases as 1/f 4.

In the case of white acceleration noise Sa, and to ﬁrst order in τR/T , the limit on the

sensitivity of the interferometer is given by :

To put this into numbers, we now calculate the requirements on the acceleration noise of
the retroreﬂecting mirror in order to reach a sensitivity of 1 mrad per shot. For the typical

typical amplitude of the vibration noise measured on the lab ﬂoor is 2 × 10−

isolation platform. To ﬁll the gap and cancel the eﬀect of vibrations, one could use the
method proposed in [18], which consists in measuring the vibrations of the mirror with a
very low noise seismometer and compensate the ﬂuctuations of the position of the mirror by
reacting on the Raman lasers phase diﬀerence.

VI. Conclusion

We have here calculated and experimentally measured the sensitivity function of a three
pulses atomic interferometer. This enables us to determine the inﬂuence of the Raman phase
noise, as well as of parasitic vibrations, on the noise on the interferometer phase. Reaching
a 1 mrad shot to shot ﬂuctuation requires a very low phase noise frequency reference, an
optimized phase lock loop of the Raman lasers, together with a very low level of parasitic

vibrations. With our typical experimental parameters, this would result in a sensitivity of
1/2 for the gravimeter.

Improvements are still possible. The frequency reference could be obtained from an
ultra stable microwave oscillator, such as a cryogenic sapphire oscillator [19], whose phase
noise lies well below the best quartz available. Besides, the requirements on the phase noise
would be easier to achieve using atoms with a lower hyperﬁne transition frequency, such as
Na or K. Trapping a very large initial number of atoms in the 3D-MOT would enable a
very drastic velocity selection. The duration of the Raman pulses could then be signiﬁcantly
increased, which makes the interferometer less sensitive to high frequency Raman phase
noise. The manipulation of the atoms can also be implemented using Bragg pulses [20], [21].
The diﬀerence in the frequencies of the two beams being much smaller, the requirements
on the relative phase stability is easy to achieve. In that case, a diﬀerent detection method
needs to be implemented as atoms in both exit ports of the interferometer are in the same
internal state. Using ultracold atoms with subrecoil temperature, atomic wavepackets at
the two exit ports can be spatially separated, which allows for a simple detection based on
absorption imaging. Such an interferometer would beneﬁt from the long interaction times
available in space to reach a very high sensitivity.

We also want to emphasize that the sensitivity function can also be used to calculate the
phase shifts arising from all possible systematic eﬀects, such as the light shifts, the magnetic
ﬁeld gradients and the cold atom collisions.

HHG

The optimized pulse:

• Synopsis of the discovered features plus simpliﬁcation

→ attosecond pulse train with rectangular pulses with a duration of 90 as (laser period 1.5 fs)

The HHG process in an atomic system:

• Ionization of a bound electron

• Propagation of the ionized electron in the continuum → energy gain

• Recombination of the ionized electron with the atomic core → Emission of high-harmonics

→ the HHG process is a potential source of highly energetic radiation

Parameters:

• optical laser wavelength λ = 456 nm (angular frequency ω = 0.1 a.u.)

• atomic ionization potential Ip at the borderline between tunneling and over-the-barrier ionization
• laser intensities up to 5 × 1019 W/cm2, i.e. strongly relativistic

The nonrelativistic regime [1]:

• v/c ≪ 1, laser magnetic ﬁeld neglectable, no drift of
the ionized electron in laser propagation direction

• eﬀective recombination of the ionized electron with

the atomic core → high emission rate of HHG

• nonrelativistic description valid up to intensities of

• maximal energy of the emitted radiation: 3Up + Ip =

1017 W/cm2

6 keV

The relativistic regime [2]:

• laser magnetic ﬁeld nonnegligible, drift of the ionized
electron in laser propagation direction → most of the
electron wave packet misses the atomic core

• emission rate strongly suppressed

→ It is not possible to generate highly
energetic radiation with the HHG process in
an atomic system by a simple increase of the
laser intensity

Is it possible to reduce the drift of the ionized electron signiﬁcantly by changing the
shape of the laser ﬁeld from sinusoidal oscillations to specially tailored laser pulses?

• applying the single-active electron approximation

Construction of the optimized pulse [4]:
• Analysis of the saddle points with the Fourier expansion of an arbitrary pulse E(η) =

K
k=−K ck exp(ikω0η)

P

• Variation of the coeﬃcients ck
• Minimizing ℑ(η′′)

→ optimized pulse

Features of the optimized pulse:

• strong decrease of the laser ﬁeld strength after the phase of ionization

→ concentration of the ionization force on a short time interval

• long time span with weak laser ﬁeld strength after ionization

→ Propagation with nonrelativistic velocity, i.e. no drift

• strong and short pulse shortly before recombination

→ concentration of the acceleration force on a short time interval, i.e. fast energy gain, little drift

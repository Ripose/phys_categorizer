Abstract

We investigate systematic errors associated with a common modulation tech-

nique used for phase sensitive detection of a coherent population trapping

(CPT) resonance. In particular, we show that modiﬁcation of the CPT res-

onance lineshape due to the presence of oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds leads to frequency

shifts which may limit the stability of CPT-based atomic clocks. We also

demonstrate that an alternative demodulation technique greatly reduces these

eﬀects.

Coherent Population Trapping (CPT)1 has recently been applied to the development of

small stable clocks with observed fractional frequency stability (Allan deviation) of better
than 10−11 τ −1/2 for averaging times, τ , around 100 seconds2,3,4,5. CPT clocks have potential

advantages relative to traditional intensity optical pumping clocks (which typically employ

an optical and microwave double resonance technique)2 including the possibility of substan-

tial miniaturization without degradation of performance6,7. However, various mechanisms

may degrade the frequency stability of CPT clocks below that theoretically expected from

the observed signal-to-noise ratio. One key mechanism for such degradation is conversion

of FM laser noise to AM noise in the detected CPT transmission signal, due to the optical

absorption proﬁle when a laser with a large linewidth is used8,9. Here we demonstrate a

second important degradation mechanism: a widely-used slow phase-modulation technique

leads to shifts of the clock frequency in the presence of asymmetries in the CPT resonance.

We also show that a straightforward variation of this modulation technique (i.e., use of

third-harmonic demodulation) can eliminate much of the systematic eﬀect on the clock

frequency.

A CPT clock employs two optical ﬁelds that are nominally resonant with electronic

transitions in alkali atoms such as Rb or Cs, with the frequency diﬀerence between the optical

ﬁelds being equal to the hyperﬁne splitting of the alkali’s electronic ground-state. Initially,

these two ﬁelds optically pump the atoms into a non-interacting coherent superposition of

two hyperﬁne states (a “dark state”)1. The long relaxation time of the electronic ground-

state leads to enhanced transmission of the optical ﬁelds in a narrow resonance around the

diﬀerence frequency of the two optical ﬁelds. The center frequency of this resonance serves

as the CPT clock frequency; the width of the resonance is determined by the decoherence

rate of the dark state.

In the typical manifestation of a CPT clock, a current-modulated diode laser produces

the two resonant optical ﬁelds (Fig. 1). Such a laser, with an optical frequency ωopt and

modulated at a microwave frequency ωµ, generates an electric ﬁeld,

E = E0 cos ωoptt +

(1)

E−1 cos (ωopt − ωµ) t + E+1 cos (ωopt + ωµ) t +

E−2 cos (ωopt − 2ωµ) t + E+2 cos (ωopt + 2ωµ) t +

. . .

2

where Ei are the amplitudes of the various frequency components of the electric ﬁeld. The

corresponding Rabi frequencies for the atomic transitions driven by the ﬁelds are Ωi =

diEi/(2¯h) where di is the atomic transition dipole moment. If the modulation frequency is

equal to half the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting (ωµ = ∆hfs/2) and the laser carrier (ωopt)

is tuned midway between the electronic transition frequency for the ground-state hyperﬁne

sublevels, then the ﬁrst-order (±1) sidebands are simultaneously resonant with the electronic

transitions for the two hyperﬁne sublevels, and a maximum optical transmission is observed.

However, additional oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds are also created by the laser current-modulation.

(The carrier, Ω0, and the second-order sidebands, Ω±2, are generally the most signiﬁcant

oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds.) Even though these ﬁelds are far-detuned from the atomic resonances,

they induce an AC Stark shift, which depends on both the optical ﬁeld frequency and

intensity, and causes a relative shift in the atomic levels (a “light shift” in the CPT clock

frequency). This sensitivity of the CPT resonance to laser detuning and intensity can limit

the stability of a CPT clock. Fortunately, with careful choice of current-modulation index,

AC Stark shifts from diﬀerent oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds can be arranged to cancel one another2.

Phase sensitive detection is often used to provide a sensitive feedback signal for the local

oscillator (e.g., a quartz crystal) which is typically locked to the CPT resonance to make a

functioning clock. Typically, a “slow” (< 1 kHz) phase modulation is superimposed on the

microwave source, leading to a modiﬁcation of the phase of the microwave drive:

ωµt → ωµt + ǫ sin (2πfmt)

(2)

where fm is the modulation frequency and ǫ is the modulation index. After demodulation

the (approximately) symmetric CPT transmission resonance is transformed into an (approx-

imately) antisymmetric dispersion-like signal. Near an exactly symmetric CPT resonance,

this dispersion-like signal is proportional to the frequency diﬀerence between the local os-

cillator and the center of the CPT resonance, and thus the local oscillator can be locked

exactly to the CPT resonance by measuring the microwave frequency (ωµ) corresponding

to the zero-crossing of the dispersion-like signal. However, any asymmetry in the CPT

transmission resonance lineshape shifts the zero-crossing of the dispersion-like signal, with

a magnitude dependent upon the slow phase-modulation parameters. Instability in these

modulation parameters will thus induce instability in the CPT clock microwave frequency.

Here we present a detailed experimental study of such shifts, and demonstrate that the

main contribution is made by the far-detuned optical carrier, Ω0, (designated as ﬁeld “0” in

Fig. 1). Note that in principle, the slow phase-modulation and the resultant systematic ef-

fects on CPT clock performance may be eliminated. For example, the microwave signal that

modulates the laser may be produced by direct feedback from a fast output photodetector10.

Fig. 2 shows a schematic of our experimental set-up. We derived the two optical ﬁelds

needed for the CPT clock by phase modulating the output from an external cavity diode
laser11 tuned in the vicinity of the D1 line of Rb (52S1/2 −→ 52P1/2, λ ≃ 795 nm). An
electro-optic modulator (EOM)12 produced the phase modulation of the optical ﬁeld at half

of the ground-state hyperﬁne frequency of 87Rb (∆hfs ≃ 6.8 GHz). With the microwave

power available to the EOM in these measurements (roughly 1 watt), approximately 15%

of the incident laser power was transferred to all sidebands, with the remainder residing

in the oﬀ-resonant carrier. Ideally, the EOM should produce equal amplitudes in the ±1

sidebands, but due to a slight misalignment of the input polarization, the +1 sideband was

1.3 dB larger than the −1 sideband, producing a 35% larger Rabi frequency (Ω+1) for the
|F = 1i −→ |F ′ = 2i transition, than the Rabi frequency (Ω−1) |F = 2i −→ |F ′ = 2i

transition. Following the EOM, all the optical ﬁelds were attenuated by a neutral density

of about 0.8 mm as they passed through a Rb vapor cell.

The vapor cell was placed inside three-layers of high permeability magnetic shielding to

screen out external ﬁelds, with a solenoid also inside the magnetic shields to control the

magnetic ﬁeld. The 2.5 cm diameter, 5 cm long vapor cell contained natural abundance Rb

and 5 Torr of nitrogen buﬀer gas. The buﬀer gas slowed the Rb atomic motion through the

vapor cell. The vapor cell was thermally stabilized using a blown-air oven at a temperature
of 45 ◦C. The total Rb vapor pressure at this temperature corresponds to a 87Rb atomic
density of 2 · 1010 cm−3. Under these conditions the optical depth of the vapor cell was

approximately one, for a weak resonant optical ﬁeld.

ﬁeld, the two lower 87Rb states F = 1, mF = 0 and F = 2, mF = 0 and the excited state
F ′ = 2, mF ′ = 1 (Fig. 1). We chose these hyperﬁne sublevels so as to have no ﬁrst-order

dependence of hyperﬁne transition frequency on magnetic ﬁeld. We applied a magnetic ﬁeld

photon resonance, thus preventing unwanted coherences from developing.

We used phase sensitive detection to convert the approximately symmetric CPT trans-

mission resonance of the two-photon “clock transition” into a dispersive-like resonance (Fig.

3). We applied a slow phase-modulation to the microwave source driving the EOM, and

then demodulated the corresponding slow variations in the photodetector current using a

lock-in ampliﬁer.

In a working CPT clock, a feedback loop locks the external oscillator

to the zero-crossing of the antisymmetric, modulated line. Here, rather than closing the

6

loop in the feedback system, we measured the frequency of the zero-crossing (by ﬁtting a

line through the central part of the dispersive-like resonance) relative to a frequency source

phase-locked to a hydrogen maser. We then varied system parameters such as the laser de-

tuning (ωopt), slow phase-modulation frequency (fm), or modulation index (ǫ), and measured

the zero-crossing as a function of these parameters.

Drifts in the zero-crossing will directly lead to changes in the clock frequency and thus

degrade the frequency stability of the CPT clock. To characterize such variations in the clock

frequency (δ), we measured the dependence of the zero-crossing on the laser carrier detuning

(∆), for various slow phase (i.e., lock-in) modulation parameters. (Note that ∆ was also the

detuning of the ﬁrst order sidebands from the center of the Doppler broadened absorption

resonance.) Fig. 4a shows the measured clock frequency shift as a function of laser detuning

for various slow phase-modulation (lock-in) indices at one ﬁxed laser modulation index

(EOM power). We ﬁnd that near the center of the Doppler-broadened atomic transition,

the clock frequency is proportional to the laser detuning (see the linear ﬁts in Fig. 4a), with

a slope δ/∆ that increases linearly with slow phase-modulation index (at ﬁxed slow phase-

modulation frequency) as shown on Fig. 4b. We observed similar behavior upon changing

the slow phase-modulation frequency at ﬁxed slow phase-modulation index. These shifts are

signiﬁcant in comparison to the desired frequency stability of a CPT clock, with fractional
clock frequency sensitivity to laser detuning of order 10−11/MHz. As shown in Fig. 4c, we

also observed a dependence of the clock frequency on slow phase-modulation index, with the

laser ﬁelds tuned to resonance, i.e., with ∆ = 0. This “laser-frequency-independent” shift
is of order 10−8 (fractionally) for 100% changes in the modulation index. Good CPT clock

frequency stability therefore requires high stability of the slow phase-modulation frequency

and amplitude, even in the absence of laser frequency variation.

Light shifts (i.e., AC Stark shifts) associated with unequal intensities of the ﬁrst-order

laser sidebands13,14 are expected to scale linearly with the laser detuning:

δ ∝ −∆

|Ω+1|2 − |Ω−1|2
γ2

,

(3)

where Ω±1 are the Rabi frequencies of the resonant laser sidebands and γ is the relaxation

rate of the excited state. The data in Fig. 4a exhibit this linear scaling of δ with ∆. However,

this simple light-shift mechanism does not account for the observed dependence of the clock

frequency on the slow phase-modulation index (see Fig. 4b and 4c). The above light-shift

Fig. 4. a) Measured 87Rb CPT clock frequency shift (δ) as a function of detuning (∆)
of the laser carrier frequency and resonant sidebands from F ′ = 2 resonance, for various

slow phase-modulation indices (ǫ). Here, a zero frequency shift (δ = 0) corresponds to the

free-space 87Rb hyperﬁne frequency. The large oﬀset of δ ≈ 1360 Hz is due to the nitrogen

buﬀer gas pressure shift. b) Dependence of the clock frequency on laser detuning (δ/∆),

uncertainties were comparable to the size of the symbols shown.

expression assumes that the CPT resonance remains symmetric near the center, only shifting

due to the Rabi frequency diﬀerence. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the clock frequency shift

(δ) depends on the modulation index (ǫ) indicating that the CPT resonance is asymmetric.

[A similar dependence of δ on the slow phase-modulation frequency (fm) was also observed

8

D
(Fig. 7a).] Additionally, these dependencies do not vanish at ∆ = 0, indicating that other

frequency shift mechanisms are present.

One such mechanism is the light shift caused by the oﬀ-resonant carrier ﬁeld. As with

the Rabi frequency imbalance described above, this light shift is usually expected to cause a

simple shift in the clock frequency but no distortion of the lineshape. The shift is expected

to be ≃ 2|Ω0|2/∆0, where Ω0 is the carrier ﬁeld Rabi frequency and ∆0 = ∆hfs/2 is the

magnitude of the carrier’s detuning from both transitions in the Λ-system for ∆ = 0. With-

out a distortion of the lineshape, no dependence of the clock frequency shift (δ) on the slow

phase-modulation parameters should exist. Fig. 5 shows the measured clock frequency shift

as a function of laser carrier ﬁeld power (∼ |Ω0|2) at two slow phase-modulation frequencies

and two total powers in the ﬁrst-order sidebands, all for ∆ = 0. In addition to the usual

light shift, we observe a dependence on the slow phase-modulation frequency of approxi-

mately 20 mHz/µW/Hz. Consistent with Eq. (3) at ∆ = 0, we do not ﬁnd a dependence of

δ on the ﬁrst-order sideband power, |Ω±1|. From these measurements, we conclude that the

interaction of the strong, oﬀ-resonant carrier ﬁeld of the modulated laser not only shifts the

clock frequency, but also modiﬁes the transmission resonance lineshape.

To further study the dependence of the clock frequency on the carrier ﬁeld, we inserted a

Fabry-Perot cavity between the EOM and the vapor cell in a slightly altered experimental

setup15. This cavity had a free spectral range of 1.37 GHz (1/5 of the 87Rb hyperﬁne

splitting) and was tuned such that it allowed the transmission of the two ﬁrst-order sidebands

of the laser while rejecting the carrier frequency ﬁeld. A more symmetric output signal was

detected (see Fig. 6), and the dependence of the clock frequency shifts on the slow phase-

modulation parameters (ǫ and fm) were reduced by at least an order of magnitude.

We explored alternative techniques for slow phase-modulation with the goal of reducing

the dependence of the CPT clock frequency on system parameters. For example, we inves-

tigated demodulation using the third harmonic of the slow phase-modulation, a technique

that is known to compensate for linear asymmetry in an underlying resonance16,17. We

found that the clock frequency for both ﬁrst- and third-harmonic demodulation has a linear

dependence on the slow modulation frequency (Fig. 7a). However, with third-harmonic de-

modulation, the slope of this dependence is a factor of ﬁve smaller, reducing the sensitivity

of the clock frequency to changes in either the laser carrier frequency (e.g., Fig. 4a) or the

properties of the slow phase-modulation source (Fig. 4a and b). Similarly, we found that

Fig. 5. Measured dependence of the CPT clock frequency on carrier ﬁeld power at one-photon

resonance (∆ = 0), for two slow phase-modulation frequencies and two total powers in the

ﬁrst-order sidebands. (Uncertainties in the measured clock frequencies are approximately

equal to the size of the points.) Linear ﬁts are shown for all data points at each of the two

modulation frequencies.

third-harmonic demodulation reduces the laser-frequency-independent shift by at least an
order of magnitude to fractional shifts of less than 10−9 for 100% changes in modulation

index.

One must also consider the change in measurement sensitivity to the clock transition

when changing the slow phase-modulation technique. We deﬁne the measurement sensitiv-

ity as the ratio of the ﬁtted central slope of the dispersive-like resonance divided by the

RMS ﬂuctuations in the ﬁt residuals. Optimal measurement sensitivity occurs for the slow

phase-modulation index and frequency that provide maximum signal at the photodetector

in the slow phase-modulation sidebands demodulated by the lock-in ampliﬁer. This optimal

sensitivity is achieved when the width of the “comb” of slow phase-modulation sidebands

transmitted through the atomic medium is comparable to the CPT resonance width. At the

optimal slow phase-modulation index for ﬁrst harmonic demodulation, we found that the

measurement sensitivity when using third harmonic demodulation is substantially reduced;

however, we recovered the original sensitivity by increasing the slow phase-modulation index

(Fig. 7b).

The measurement sensitivity’s dependence on modulation index is consistent with a sim-

ple Lorentzian model. We calculated the dispersive curves obtained by applying slow modu-

lation at frequency fm and index ǫ to a Lorentzian lineshape and determined the slope of the

curve near the zero-crossing. The lines in Fig. 7b show this slope as a function of modulation

index with only the ratio of the Lorentzian resonance linewidth to the modulation frequency

and the overall amplitude adjusted to ﬁt the data. Note, however, that this model does

not include a realistic CPT lineshape or the eﬀects of oﬀ-resonant ﬁelds and thus does not

reproduce the data in Fig. 7a.

In conclusion, we have quantitatively studied systematic eﬀects on CPT clock frequency

due to asymmetries in the two-photon CPT resonance induced by strong oﬀ-resonant laser

ﬁelds. These asymmetries can produce signiﬁcant shifts in the CPT clock frequency when

slow phase-modulation is used to determine the center of the CPT resonance. While lowering

the frequency of the slow phase-modulation decreases the sensitivity of the clock to such

systematic frequency shifts, technical noise reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (and hence the

clock’s short-term frequency stability) at very slow phase-modulation frequencies.

To achieve good fractional frequency stability ∼ 10−11 in a CPT clock, these systematic

frequency shifts impose demanding requirements on the stability of the elements that control

the slow phase-modulation (fm and ǫ) and the laser carrier frequency (ωopt). Fortunately,

there are promising alternative modulation techniques that can mitigate the eﬀects of CPT

lineshape asymmetry in the presence of non-resonant laser ﬁelds. A careful choice of the fast

(microwave) modulation index allows the AC Stark shifts from diﬀerent oﬀ-resonant laser

ﬁelds to cancel each other2. As demonstrated here, third-harmonic demodulation of the slow

phase-modulation greatly reduces the sensitivity to asymmetry in the CPT resonance.

15. For this series of measurements, we used a vapor cell with isotopically enriched 87Rb

and 22 Torr of Ne buﬀer gas. The change in buﬀer gas leads to both a diﬀerent overall

clock frequency shift and a narrower CPT resonance than the 5 Torr N2 cell we used

for the other measurements we report here.

We study the evolution of ultracold plasmas by measuring the electron temperature. Shortly
after plasma formation, competition between heating and cooling mechanisms drives the electron
temperature to a value within a narrow range regardless of the initial energy imparted to the
electrons. In agreement with theory predictions, plasmas exhibit values of the Coulomb coupling
parameter Γ less than 1.

Knowledge of the electron temperature is critical to
understanding the behavior of ultracold plasmas formed
by the photoionization of laser-cooled atoms [1]. Un-
til now, this important parameter had not been directly
measured. Simple consideration of the photoionization
process (i.e. considering only single atoms in isolation)
implies that the initial kinetic energy of the electrons in
the plasma is proportional to the energy of the photoion-
ization photon in excess of the ionization limit. In this
case, only the linewidth of the photoionization laser limits
the lowest energy imparted to the electrons, and in prin-
ciple plasmas with electron temperatures below 1K could
be created. The relationship between the actual electron
temperature and temperatures obtained from this simple
consideration remains an open question.

Several strong heating and cooling processes in the
plasma can have a radical eﬀect on the temperature
of the system. Continuum lowering [2, 3], correlation-
induced heating [4, 5], three-body recombination to Ry-
dberg atoms and the evolution (deexcitation) of the Ry-
dberg atoms [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] are all predicted to result
in heating of the electrons that increases with increasing
density. Conversely, the electrons possess thermal pres-
sure that causes the plasma to expand [11], and that in
turn induces strong adiabatic cooling. Evaporative cool-
ing is certainly present as well. All of these processes can
act within the ﬁrst few microseconds after the plasma is
created, and so the evolution of the electron temperature
will be determined by the balance of these (and perhaps
other) heating and cooling processes.

The determination of the electron temperature will be
useful in interpreting the results of future experiments
with ultracold plasmas. Measurements of the electron
temperature test molecular dynamics simulations’ [2, 5]
predictions of this fundamental plasma parameter. Be-
cause electron-atom collisions such as Rydberg recom-
bination and superelastic scattering inﬂuence tempera-
ture, atomic collision theory in plasmas can also be tested
[3, 8, 9, 10]. Finally, a measurement of the electron tem-
perature is necessary in order to determine to what ex-
tent, if any, the electrons of these ultracold plasmas are
in the strongly coupled (i.e. correlated) regime [12].

The ratio of Coulomb energy to thermal energy, Γ,

expresses the importance of correlations in the plasma.
This parameter is deﬁned (for the electrons) as Γ =
1
4πn )1/3 is the Wigner-Seitz ra-
4πǫ0
dius, e is the electron charge, n is the average plasma
density, and T is the electron temperature. For Γ > 1
(the strongly coupled regime), spatial correlations in the
plasma develop and phase transitions are possible [12].
It is predicted [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9] that various heating ef-
fects in the plasma will each limit Γ to be less than 1,
so measuring Γ also tests the validity of these theoretical
treatments.
In general, strongly coupled neutral plas-
mas (distinct from strongly coupled non-neutral plasmas
[13, 14, 15, 16]) are rare and diﬃcult to produce in the
laboratory; ultracold plasmas could potentially be cold
enough to reach the strongly coupled regime.

In this work we measure the electron temperature a
short time after the plasma formation. The creation of
ultracold plasmas in our apparatus has been previously
[1]. Brieﬂy, we use a Magneto-Optic
described in Ref.
Trap (MOT) to collect and cool 4x106 metastable xenon
atoms to a temperature of about 20µK. The spatial den-
sity distribution is roughly gaussian with a typical rms
radius σ ∼ 250 µm. We produce the plasma in a 10 ns
two-photon excitation of up to 30% of the initial sample,
with the number N of photoionized atoms and the initial
electron energy ∆E controlled by the intensity and fre-
quency of the photoionizing laser, respectively [17]. We
apply small electric ﬁelds (∼ 0.3 − 4 V/m) to the plasma
during its evolution by controlling voltages on wire mesh
grids (>95% transmission) positioned above and below
the plasma region. Electrons that leave the plasma are
directed to a microchannel plate (MCP) detector. We
determine the density and size of the plasma by measur-
ing its radio-frequency (RF) response as in [11], with a
slight modiﬁcation to the calibration used there. In light
of recent theoretical work [2, 18], we now base our size
calibration on the measured asymptotic expansion veloc-
ity of high ∆E (∆E/kB ≥ 400K), low N (N ≤ 5x104)
plasmas [19].

After the photoionization pulse, some electrons rapidly
escape as a result of the kinetic energy imparted dur-
ing photoionization. This results in an excess of ions as
compared to electrons in the plasma region and a space

charge develops. This space charge in turn conﬁnes the
remaining electrons in a potential well [1]. Elastic colli-
sions rapidly redistribute the remaining electrons’ energy
into a thermal distribution [20]. Since the ions in the
plasma are unconﬁned, the plasma expands outward in
response to the thermal pressure of the electrons [11].

Due to the low temperatures and small size of the
plasma, the standard methods used to measure plasma
temperatures are not applicable [21]. We developed a
method in which we probe the energy distribution of the
electrons to measure T . After a desired amount of evo-
lution time, an electric ﬁeld is turned on. This ﬁeld sud-
denly lowers the lip of the potential well conﬁning the
electrons, and energetic electrons become unconﬁned (see
Fig. 1). These electrons then spill from the plasma and
strike the MCP. Figs. 2 and 3 show a typical spill signal
and a plot of the fraction of electrons spilled as a func-
tion of the electric ﬁeld amplitude F , respectively.
In
order to avoid having to dynamically model the chang-
ing conﬁnement during the spill, the fraction spilled f is
kept small enough so that the ratio Nelectron/Nion is not
altered substantially.

A model is necessary in order to extract the temper-
ature from the measured spilling curves. We developed
a method to solve for the electron density distribution
given the ion density, electron number, and temperature.
Since the electrons’ conﬁning potential is inﬂuenced by
the electrons themselves, their density distribution is cal-
culated self-consistently, starting from an approximate
distribution and iteratively improving that distribution
until it converges to a self-consistent result. While this
self-consistent calculation allowed us to calculate f as a
function of F , we found that f calculated this way was
highly sensitive to the details of the ion density distri-
bution. We did not want the measured temperature to

be contingent on a simulation of the motion of the ions
in the plasma (especially since the density of atoms in
our MOT is not perfectly spherically symmetric or gaus-
sian). Therefore, we switched to a more robust method
that does not depend explicitly on the ion density distri-
bution. This method relies on the fact that at positions
far enough away from the center of the plasma, the elec-
tron potential is U (r) = − (Nions−Nelectrons)e

less of the ion and electron density distributions. The
fraction spilled as a function of F is then modeled using
the following expression:

where D(ǫ) is the density of states calculated for the
plasma’s electron potential in its asymptotic limit, λ and
β are ﬁt parameters corresponding to the chemical poten-
tial and a background subtraction, Ecut(F ) is determined
by the magnitude of F as shown in Fig. 1, and Ecut(F0)
is determined in the same way for F0, which is the bias
electric ﬁeld present before the spilling ﬁeld is turned on.
As long as the saddle point associated with Ecut is far
enough from the center of the plasma, Eq. (1) will be a
good approximation of the number of electrons spilled in
response to lowering the potential barrier.

We tested the validity of this model in several ways.
First, we compared values of T derived from ﬁts to
Eq. (1) with T determined from the more sophisticated
self-consistent model for a variety of diﬀerent ion den-
sity distributions. The values of T from the two diﬀerent
methods matched to better than 20% for the plasma pa-
rameters examined in this work. The form of D(ǫ) was
varied and found to have little eﬀect on the ﬁt tempera-
ture [22]. Finally, experiments were performed where RF
pulses were applied to impart a variable amount of heat.
The temperatures determined using Eq. (1) shortly after
these pulses scaled linearly with applied RF power [23].

FIG. 3: Fraction of electrons spilled (f ) vs. Ecut for a typical
set of data (ﬁlled circles). Fits using the model based on Eq.
(1) are shown for the temperatures that are indicated, where
the 35K curve is the best ﬁt curve and the other two are
shown for comparison. Note that the value of T is determined
primarily from the curvature of f vs. Ecut.

In order to accurately calculate f in both the self-
consistent model and in the model represented by Eq.
(1), we must include the screening of the external ﬁeld by
the plasma. This screening is approximated by the use of
a “screening radius,” within which the external electric
ﬁeld does not penetrate. The resulting induced dipole
ﬁeld is then included in the calculation of Ecut. We es-
timate values for the screening radius by calculating the
ﬁrst-order correction, due to the presence of the electric
ﬁeld, to the electron density distribution self-consistently
determined in the absence of the ﬁeld.

Temperature measurements were taken over a range
of ion numbers (0.1-2x106), at several diﬀerent values of
∆E, and at diﬀerent plasma evolution times. The plasma
evolution times that can be studied are constrained to be
from ∼3-8 µs for higher ∆E and from ∼4-15 µs for lower
∆E. At early times, the electrons in the prompt peak
distort the spilling signal. At later times, the plasma
expands to sizes large enough so that the saddle points
induced by the spilling ﬁeld are inside the 1
r part of the
potential, violating a central assumption of our model
and thus rendering it inapplicable.

Figure 4 shows the measured values of T (Fig. 4(a))
and Γ (Fig. 4(b)) vs. plasma evolution time for various
values of ∆E. Two features in Fig. 4 are immediately ap-
parent. First, cooling is observed as the plasma expands,
as is expected from the dynamics of the expansion [11].
Second, the temperatures observed for the lower values
of ∆E are greater than ∆E itself, clearly indicating the
importance of heating in the early stages of the plasma.
Indeed, the range of temperatures observed falls in a re-
markably narrow band given the factor of 30 range in
the value of ∆E. As the number of ions is varied, the
same qualitative features are present. The values of T
decrease as N is reduced, but in such a way that Γ does
not increase substantially. For the most favorable con-
ditions (late times, ∆E/kB = 30K-100K, low N ) values

to the plasma evolution time just after the initial electrons
have escaped from the plasma. Times 0.5-2 µs earlier (de-
pending on ∆E) and a few microseconds later were also mea-
sured. The error bars show only the statistical uncertainty.

of Γ in the range of 0.1-0.15 were consistently achieved,
and thus these plasmas are not in the strongly coupled
regime at these times. It is still possible that Γ increases
above 1 at much later times where we cannot apply our
measurement methods. However, we do not see evidence
for rapidly increasing Γ vs. time at the later evolution
times we can observe.

Several systematic uncertainties have to be taken into
account. The dominant uncertainties are in the calibra-
tion of the ion number (35%), in the appropriate value of
the screening radius, and in the calibration of the plasma
density. When combined in quadrature, these uncertain-
ties produce a 70% overall systematic uncertainty in the
measurement of T .

Several assumptions are also made in the analysis:
that the highest-energy electrons are in thermal equilib-
rium with the rest of the electrons; that f is propor-
tional to the number of electrons with energy greater
than Ecut; and that the implicit truncation in the ther-
mal distribution due to the ﬁnite potential depth does

not aﬀect its Maxwell-Boltzmann character at the ener-
gies corresponding to the values of Ecut used. By exam-
ining spilling curves and observing the ﬂux of escaping
electrons after the spilling peak, we determined that the
plasma evolution times at which we took data were four
times or more longer than the characteristic time that it
took for elastic collisions to ﬁll the spilled energy levels,
supporting the ﬁrst assumption. The last two assump-
tions are consistent with our observations based on the
comparison of spilling data with diﬀerent ranges of Ecut
(i. e. cutting more or less deeply for the same experimen-
tal parameters), in which we observed no signiﬁcant shift
of T as a function of the range of Ecut.

The observation that Γ is limited to values less than
1 is consistent with theory predictions [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9].
Given the previously measured importance of Rydberg
atom formation and evolution [6] and the range of plasma
evolution times studied in this work, comparing our re-
sults to the Γ ∼ 0.2 prediction of Refs. [8, 9] is more di-
rect than comparison to the other predictions cited. For
the relatively early plasma evolution times studied in this
work, we measured values of Γ that are signiﬁcantly less
than predicted by Refs.
[8, 9], and indeed are less than
what would be naively implied by the other predictions
[2, 3, 4, 5] as well. Measurement of the full time evolu-
tion of and T and Γ remains a challenge that will require
a new measurement technique. In the future, it is pos-
sible that measurements of the Rydberg distribution as
a function of plasma evolution time can be used to mea-
sure temperatures over a larger fraction of the plasma
lifetime.

In conclusion, we have developed a method of mea-
suring the temperature of ultracold plasmas shortly after
the plasmas are created. This is done by measuring the
response of the plasma to electric ﬁelds and thereby ob-
taining the energy distribution of the highest-energy elec-
trons. Signiﬁcant cooling was observed when the initial
kinetic energy of the electrons was large, and significant
heating was observed when low initial kinetic energies
were imparted, driving the temperatures into a relatively
narrow range. The electron components of the ultracold
plasma were never observed to be in the strongly coupled
regime, conﬁrming predictions by theory. The colder ions
may yet be in the strongly coupled regime, a possibility
currently being studied by another group [24].

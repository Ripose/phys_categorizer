Three-body collisions of ultracold identical Bose atoms under tight cylindrical conﬁnement are
analyzed. A Feshbach resonance in two-body collisions is described by a two-channel zero-range
interaction. Elimination of the closed channel in the three-body problem reduces the interaction
to a one-channel zero-range one with an energy dependent strength. The related problem with an
energy independent strength (the Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model) has an exact solution and forbids
all chemical processes, such as three-atom association and diatom dissociation, as well as reﬂection
in atom-diatom collisions. The resonant case is analyzed by a numerical solution of the Faddeev-
Lovelace equations. The results demonstrate that as the internal symmetry of the Lieb-Liniger-
McGuire model is lifted, the reﬂection and chemical reactions become allowed and may be observed
in experiments.

Ultracold atoms under tight cylindrical conﬁnement
can reach the “single-mode”, or quasi-one-dimensional
(1D) regime, where only the ground state of trans-
verse motion is signiﬁcantly populated. Quasi-1D atomic
quantum gases have been realized recently in elongated
atomic traps (see [1, 2, 3, 4]), two-dimensional optical
lattices (see [5, 6, 7]), atomic waveguides (see [8] and
references therein), and atomic integrated optics devices
(see [9, 10] and references therein). These systems at-
tract increasing attention due to their possible applica-
tions to atomic interferometry, quantum measurement,
and quantum computation.

Properties of quasi-1D systems are frequently analyzed
using the Lieb-Liniger-McGuire (LLMG) model [16, 17]
with δ function atom-atom interaction Uaδ (z), where z
is the interatomic distance. The interaction strength Ua
has been related in Ref. [11] (being denoted as g1D) to
the three-dimensional (3D) elastic scattering length a3D
and the waveguide transverse frequency ω⊥. The LLMG
model has an exact Bethe-ansatz solution [16, 17] ex-
pressed as the superposition of plane waves with all pos-
sible permutations of the asymptotic momenta pj, one
per each atom. Therefore, the atoms can exchange their
re-
momenta, but the asymptotic momentum set
mains unchanged.

The integrability of the LLMG model results from its
high internal symmetry. This symmetry can be violated
in real physical systems, e. g., when Feshbach resonance
is used to tune the elastic scattering length. The eﬀect
of Feshbach resonance appears in 2B scattering when the
collision energy of a pair of atoms in an open channel is
close to the energy of a bound state (resonant molecule)
in a closed channel (see Ref. [14]). Two-body Feshbach
resonance collisions in atomic waveguides have been ana-
lyzed in Ref. [15]. The results demonstrate that when the
collision energy is low enough compared to the trap fre-
quency, the problem can be treated as essentially 1D, but
with an energy-dependent zero-range interaction. The
present work demonstrates that a Feshbach resonance
leads to non-integrability of few-body problems, allow-
ing for chemical processes (association and dissociation),
as well as atom-diatom reﬂection.

The approach used in Ref. [15] for two-atom scatter-
ing leads in a 3B problem to a system of two coupled
equations for the wavefunctions in the momentum repre-
sentation, ϕ0 (q1, q2, q3) and ϕ1 (q1, qm), associated with
the three-atom and atom-molecule channels, respectively.
Using a system of units in which ¯h = 1, the equations are

Here qj are the momenta of the atoms, qm is the mo-
mentum of the resonant molecule, and Q = q1 + q2 + q3
is the center-of-mass momentum. The parameters of the
1D problem — the atom-atom interaction strength Ua,
the atom-molecule coupling strength g, and the detun-
ing between the atomic and molecular states D1D— can
be expressed in terms of 3D resonance scattering pa-
rameters (see Ref. [15]). The indistinguishability of the
bosonic atoms leads to the symmetry of the wavefunction
ϕ0 (q1, q2, q3) over permutation of the atomic momenta.
The energy E is counted from the threshold of the three-
atom channel.

Equation (2) neglects the interaction associated with
collisions between the resonant molecule and the third
atom. It allows a simple elimination of the atom-molecule
channel function ϕ1. As a result, the three-atom channel
wavefunction obeys the equation

This strength appears to be the same function of the col-
lision momentum as in the 2B problem (see Ref. [15]),
but here the collision energy of two atoms is expressed
in terms of the total energy E and the third atom mo-
mentum q due to momentum and energy conservation
(letting Q = 0 in the center-of-mass system used here
and below).

For a momentum dependent Ueﬀ the internal symme-
try of the LLMG model is broken, and a resonant case
does not allow a Bethe-ansatz solution. This case is
analyzed here by a numerical solution of the Faddeev-
Lovelace equations. Using the conventional Faddeev re-
duction method (see Ref. [18]), one obtains a 1D integral
equation

In the numerical solution of Eq. (5) the transition am-
plitude is expressed in terms of odd and even amplitudes
X± (p, p0) = X (p, p0)
p, p0), p > 0, that satisfy
uncoupled equations. The contributions of the poles of
T1D (q) are separated from the Cauchy principal-value
integrals as in Ref. [20]. At E > 0, when chemical pro-
cesses are allowed, the function Z (q, p) has singularities
on the real axis too. Unlike the 3D case with logarithmic
singularities, in the 1D case the singularities are simple
poles and are treated in a similar way as the poles of
T1D (q).

The reﬂection, transmission, and dissociation proba-
bilities in the collision of an atom with momentum p0

The calculated probabilities and rate coeﬃcient are

non-identical atoms with energy-independent interaction
strengths. The dissociation appears above the threshold,
where 3p2

a collision energy ǫ3 ranging between 2 and 4 (depending
on u, b, and θ), and decreases to zero for slow collisions.
These processes vanish in fast collisions, when the inter-
actions become small perturbations. The dependence of

the association rate on the energy distribution between
the atoms behaves diﬀerently for various u and b values
(see Fig. 2). No association occurs at θ = 0 when two
atoms have equal momenta.

Given a ﬁxed collision energy, the reﬂection, dissoci-
ation, and association persist over a detuning interval
(see Fig. 3). The oscillating behavior of the probabili-
ties results from interference of the odd and even ampli-
tudes X± (p, p0), which are analogs of partial waves in
3D scattering. However, unlike the 3D case, where only
the s-wave contributes to low-energy scattering due to
a centrifugal barrier, in the 1D case both odd and even
amplitudes have to be taken into account at all energies.
All chemical processes, as well as reﬂection, vanish at
large detunings, when the energy dependence of the in-
teraction strength Ueﬀ becomes negligible [see Eq. (4)],

¯h/m = 4.5
The high internal symmetry of the LLMG model can
be also violated due to virtual transverse mode excitation
even if the interaction of free atoms is non-resonant. This
eﬀect has been considered in Ref. [22] for 3B collisions in
atomic waveguides and in Ref. [23] for atom-soliton col-
lisions.
It can be also analyzed using the present ap-
proach, since a conﬁnement-induced resonance can be
represented as a kind of Feshbach resonance (see Ref.
[12]). The scattering amplitude in an atomic waveguide
(see Eq. (6.9) in Ref. [13]) can be approximated by Eq.
(6) with the proper choice of the parameters g, D1D, and
Ua. However, now the problem contains the single energy
scale, ω⊥, and the energy unit D0 will have the same or-
der. As a result, the association and dissociation rates
are negligibly small in the quasi-1D regime and the only
evidence of nonintegrability remains the atom-diatom re-
ﬂection, in agreement with Refs. [22, 23]. A narrow Fesh-
bach resonance can provide reacher physical phenomena.
In addition to association, dissociation, and reﬂection the
nonintegrability can lead to a change of the asymptotic
momentum set in three-atom elastic collisions.

In conclusion, the 3B problem with two-channel 2B
interactions can be reduced to a single-channel case with
an energy-dependent interaction strength. The energy
dependence violates the high internal symmetry of the
LLMG model, allowing chemical reactions. Reﬂection
becomes the dominant output channel of atom-diatom
low-energy collisions, while dissociation appears above a
threshold. The 3B association should be observable in
experiments.

2/u the bound state becomes more shallow, leading
to a drastic increase of the association rate. The depen-
dence on the non-resonant interaction strength (see Fig.
3) demonstrates a similar behavior : a drastic increase of
the association rate near the threshold at u = 2/b, and a
decrease of all the rates at large absolute values of u due
to the restoration of integrability.

Thus, a substantial association rate can be observed
for collision energies ranging over several units D0, which
must lie below the transverse frequency ω⊥, in order to
conserve the quasi-1D behavior of the system. This con-
dition is satisﬁed for relatively weak resonances µ∆ <

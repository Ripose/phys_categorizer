Abstract

We perform ab initio QED calculations of energy levels for the n = 1 and n = 2 states of He-like

ions with the nuclear charge in the range Z = 12-100. The complete set of two-electron QED corrections

is evaluated to all orders in the parameter αZ. Uncalculated contributions to energy levels come through

orders α3(αZ)2, α2(αZ)7, and higher. The calculation presented is the ﬁrst treatment for excited states

of He-like ions complete through order α2(αZ)4. A signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy of theoretical

predictions is achieved, especially in the high-Z region.

Introduction

Helium and helium-like ions, being the simplest many-electron systems, traditionally serve as

an important testing ground for investigations of many-body relativistic and QED effects. Cal-

culations of QED effects in He-like ions have a long history. The expression for the Lamb shift

complete through orders α(αZ)4 and α2(αZ)3 was derived in pioneering studies by Araki [1] and

Sucher [2]. Numerous posterior investigations of higher-order QED corrections in two-electron

systems (see, e.g., review [3] and recent original studies [4, 5, 6]) were primarily aimed at helium,

in which the experimental accuracy is by far better than in other two-electron systems. Recent

progress in experimental spectroscopy of highly charged ions [7, 8, 9] opened new perspectives

for probing higher-order QED effects in ions along the helium isoelectronic sequence up to He-

like uranium. Investigations of QED effects in high-Z ions are of particular importance since they

can provide tests of quantum electrodynamics in the region of a very strong Coulomb ﬁeld of the

nucleus. Another factor that stimulates these investigations is the possibility to test the standard

model by studying the effects of parity non-conservation (PNC) [10, 11, 12, 13]. Experimental
identiﬁcation of the PNC effects will require precise knowledge of the 21S0 −
like ions with nuclear charge numbers near Z = 64 (gadolinium) and Z = 90 (thorium), which

23P0 interval in He-

happens to be very small for these values of Z thus enhancing the PNC effects signiﬁcantly.

Investigations of QED effects in heavy He-like ions differ signiﬁcantly from those for the

helium atom. First of all, the nuclear coupling parameter αZ approaches unity and cannot be

regarded as a good expansion parameter as in the case of helium. But on the other side, the

electron-electron interaction in these systems is suppressed by a factor of 1/Z with respect to the

electron-nucleus interaction and, therefore, can be accounted for by a perturbation expansion in

the parameter 1/Z.

Until recently, the only QED effects calculated to all orders in αZ were the one-electron self-

energy and vacuum-polarization corrections [14, 15]. So, theoretical investigations of energy

levels in heavy He-like ions mostly relied on these one-electron values, correcting them to account

for the “screening” effect by various semi-empirical rules, notably, within Welton’s approximation,

as in Ref. [16]. A more elaborate treatment of QED effects in He-like ions was presented by Drake

[17]. His values for the QED correction included the complete contribution to order α2(αZ)3

derived in Refs. [1, 2] and parts of higher-order contributions obtained by employing the all-order

results available for the one-electron QED corrections. The total energy values of Ref. [17] are

2

complete through order α2(αZ)3 and uncalculated terms start in orders α2(αZ)4 and α3(αZ)2.

Later, Johnson and Sapirstein [18] applied relativistic many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)

to the treatment of the electron correlation for n = 2 triplet states of He-like ions. Combined with

Drake’s values for the QED and recoil corrections, their results yielded a better agreement with the

experimental data than those of Ref. [17]. While the approach of Ref. [18] is still incomplete to

order α2(αZ)4, it includes terms that were not accounted for in Ref. [17], namely the Breit-Breit

interaction and some relativistic corrections to the second-order energy. Later, other evaluations

of the electron-correlation part of the energies of He-like ions were performed by the relativistic

conﬁguration-interaction (CI) method [19] and by the relativistic all-order MBPT approach [20].

The studies [18, 19, 20] share the same main features: their treatment is based on the no-pair

Hamiltonian and the electron correlation is taken into account within the Breit approximation.

The results of these evaluations are in a very good agreement with each other.

A somewhat different approach was employed in Refs. [21, 22]. While the electron-correlation

part was evaluated (as in the previous work by the same group [19]) by the CI method, the QED

part was not taken from Ref. [17] but evaluated independently, by considering the one-loop QED

corrections in a local screening potential. Due to different treatments of QED effects, there are

certain deviations between the results of Refs. [21, 22] and those of Refs. [18, 19, 20].

In order to obtain reliable predictions for energy levels of high-Z ions and to improve the

theoretical accuracy in the low- and middle-Z region, it is necessary to take into account two-

electron QED effects without an expansion in αZ. Such project has been recently accomplished

(up to order α2) for the two-electron part of the ground-state energy of He-like ions [23, 24,

25, 26, 27] and for the lowest-lying states of Li-like ions [28, 29, 30, 31]. To perform similar

QED calculations for excited states of He-like ions is more difﬁcult. One of the reasons is that,

for the ﬁrst time in QED calculations to all orders in αZ, we encounter levels that are quasi-

degenerate, namely 23P1 and 21P1. To derive formal expressions for QED corrections in case of

quasi-degenerate states is a serious problem that has been solved ﬁrst within the two-time Green

function (TTGF) method [32, 33, 34]. Different approaches to this problem have recently been

addressed by other authors [35, 36].

Several QED corrections have been calculated to all orders in αZ for excited states of He-like

ions up to now. In our previous investigation [37], we evaluated the vacuum-polarization screening

correction for all n = 2 states of He-like ions. The two-photon exchange correction was calculated

for excited states of He-like ions by Mohr and Sapirstein [38] (23S1 and 23P0,2 states), by Andreev

3

et al. [39, 40] (21S0,1, 23P0) and [36] (21,3P1), and by ˚Asen et al. [41] (21S0,1). In this paper we

present an evaluation of the self-energy screening correction and an independent calculation of the

two-photon exchange correction for all n = 2 states of He-like ions. This completes the ab initio

treatment of all two-electron QED corrections of order α2 to all orders in αZ and signiﬁcantly

improves the theoretical accuracy for the energy values, especially in the high-Z region. Unlike

all previous calculations, the results obtained are complete through order α2(αZ)4; uncalculated

terms enter through three-photon QED effects (to order α3(αZ)2 and higher) and through two-loop

one-electron QED corrections (α2(αZ)7 and higher).

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the basic formalism and

present general formulas for the two-electron QED corrections for the case of quasi-degenerate

levels. In Section II, the numerical procedure is brieﬂy discussed and numerical results are pre-

sented for the two-photon exchange correction and the screened self-energy correction. The total

two-electron QED correction is then compiled, analyzed, and compared with the known terms of

the αZ expansion. In the last section, we present a compilation of all contributions available to the

energy levels and compare results of different theoretical evaluations with existing experimental
data. The relativistic units (~ = c = m = 1) are used throughout the paper.

I. FORMAL EXPRESSIONS

A. Basic formalism

In this section we brieﬂy formulate the basic equations of the TTGF method for quasi-

degenerate states of a He-like ion. A detailed description of the method and, particularly, its

implementation for the case of quasidegenerate states can be found in Refs. [33, 34, 42]. The

derivation will be given for two particular quasidegenerate states, (1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1, and

can immediately be extended to a more general case. The unperturbed two-electron wave functions

in the jj coupling are given by

As was noticed in Ref. [33], due to nonzero decay rates of excited states, the self-adjoint part of

H should be understood in Eqs. (9) and (19),

To zeroth order in α, the Green function g(E) is

B. One-photon exchange diagram

In order to illustrate how the method works, below we present the detailed derivation of the

correction to the quasidegenerate energy levels (1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1 due to the one-photon

exchange diagram (Fig. 1). While the corresponding evaluation is much less cumbersome than

those for the second-order two-electron corrections, it demonstrates most essential features that

are encountered in these cases. For simplicity, in the derivation below we will assume that the
unperturbed energy of the initial state i differs from that of the ﬁnal state k: E(0)

(in the

= E(0)
k

i

= k). However, all the ﬁnal formulas can be shown to

case under consideration it corresponds to i
be valid also for the case E(0)

i = E(0)
k .

According to the Feynman rules [34, 42] and the deﬁnition of g(E), the contribution of the

one-photon exchange diagram is

C. Two-photon exchange diagrams

(37)

(38)

The set of two-photon exchange diagrams is shown in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst and the second graph

are referred to as the ladder and the crossed diagram, respectively. The derivation of the general

expressions for the two-photon exchange correction in the case of quasi-degenerate levels is rather

lengthy. However, it greatly resembles the corresponding derivation for the one-photon exchange

correction presented above, on one hand, and that for the two-photon exchange diagram in case

of a single level described in detail in Ref. [45], on the other hand. We thus present only the ﬁnal

formulas for the two-photon exchange contributions to the matrix elements of the operator H (2).

1. The ladder diagram

The contribution of the two-photon ladder diagram is conveniently divided into the irreducible

and the reducible part. The reducible contribution is deﬁned as a part in which the total inter-
mediate energy of the atom equals to E(0)

2
operator H (2) is deﬁned by Eq. (18). The ﬁrst three terms in the right-hand side of this equation

and the irreducible part is the remainder. The

1 or E(0)

contribute both to the irreducible and to the reducible part. As to the others, it is natural to ascribe

them to the reducible part.

The contribution of the irreducible part of H (2)

ik is deﬁned as the self-adjoint part of the follow-

diagonal matrix elements (i

The derivation of formal expressions for the screened vacuum-polarization correction in case

of quasi-degenerate states was described in our previous work [37]. For completeness, we present

here the ﬁnal expressions for this correction; the corresponding set of Feynman diagrams is shown

in Fig. 3.

The expression for the contribution of the diagram with the vacuum-polarization loop inserted

into the photon propagator can be obtained from the formula for the one-photon exchange (38) by

replacing the operator of the electron-electron interaction I(ε) by the modiﬁed interaction,

As discussed previously in Ref. [34], a direct derivation based on the TTGF method yields a

result that differs from Eq. (66) by terms of order (α2∆), which can be disregarded as long as we

are not interested in higher orders of perturbation theory (see Ref. [34] for a detailed discussion).

II. NUMERICAL EVALUATION AND RESULTS

An important difference of the present investigation from the previous studies of QED effects

in high-Z ions is that it involves QED corrections for quasi-degenerate conﬁgurations, namely

(1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1. While the derivation of basic expressions in this case is more difﬁcult

than for a single state, the ﬁnal expressions for the diagonal matrix elements turn out to be very

similar to those for the single-level case. We can, therefore, adopt a code developed for single-

level calculations for the diagonal matrix elements of the operator H. For an evaluation of the

off-diagonal matrix elements, a generalization of the code is needed.

The numerical procedure employed in the present calculation of the two-photon exchange cor-

rection is based on that presented in detail in our previous investigations for Li-like ions [30, 47].

Apart from the angular reduction that is performed by using the standard angular-momentum tech-

nique, the evaluation is rather similar to that for Li-like ions. The calculation was carried out em-

ploying the Fermi model for the nuclear-charge distribution, with the nuclear charge radii speciﬁed

in Section III. The numerical uncertainty of the results is expected to be 1

10−4 eV in all cases

except for the off-diagonal matrix element, for which the uncertainty is 1

10−4 eV for Z

50,

10−4 eV for Z

80, and 4

10−4 eV otherwise. As a check of the numerical procedure, we

2

×

≤

×

performed the evaluation in two different gauges, the Feynman and the Coulomb ones. The two-

×

×

≤

photon exchange corrections (for mixing conﬁgurations, individual matrix elements) were found

to be gauge invariant well within the uncertainty speciﬁed.

The results of our numerical calculation of the two-photon exchange correction for n = 1

and n = 2 states of He-like ions are presented in Table I. The values listed represent correc-

tions to the energy in case of single levels and contributions to the matrix elements Hik for the

quasi-degenerate states. The energy levels for the (1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1 states are obtained

17

by diagonalizing the 2

2 matrix H containing all relevant corrections. In Table I, we present

×

also a comparison of our numerical values with the results of the previous calculations of this

correction for various states of He-like ions [23, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41]. The comparison indicates

that calculations by different groups are generally in agreement with each other. However, there

exist also certain deviations between different calculations, notably with those by Andreev et al.

[39, 40]. Regarding the comparison of the present results and the ones of Ref. [36] for the mixing

states, we would like to stress that, generally speaking, results of different methods for individual

matrix elements could be different, since the matrix H can differ by a unitary transformation. We

observe, however, that in our case the results for the individual matrix elements agree with those

of Ref. [36] approximately at the same level as for the single states.

The calculation of the screened self-energy correction for n = 2 states of He-like ions resem-

bles that for Li-like ions described in our previous work [29]. A more difﬁcult angular structure

of the initial-state wave functions for He-like ions makes ﬁnal expressions more lengthy and their

numerical evaluation more time consuming. Signiﬁcant complications appear in performing angu-

lar integrations in momentum space for the vertex part with free-electron propagators. To handle

them, we developed a generalization of the angular-integration procedure described in Ref. [29] to

arbitrary states, using our experience in calculating similar angular integrals for the two-loop self-

energy diagrams [48]. The actual calculation was carried out employing the spherical-shell model

for the nuclear-charge distribution. Our numerical results for the screened self-energy correction

for n = 1 and n = 2 states of He-like ions are presented in Table II in terms of the dimensionless

function F (αZ) deﬁned as

∆E = α2(αZ)3F (αZ) .

(69)

The values listed in the table represent corrections to the energy in case of single levels and con-

tributions to the matrix elements Hik for the quasi-degenerate states.

In case of the ground state of He-like ions, the self-energy correction was evaluated previously

by Persson et al. [25], by us [27], and by Sunnergren [49]. In the present work, we recalculated

this correction using the new code and found an excellent agreement with our previous results and

with those by Sunnergren. A small deviation of the present result for Z = 90 from the old one is

due to a more recent value for the nuclear charge radius used in this work.

We note that the values presented in Table II for n = 2 states of He-like ions can also be used for

determining the screened self-energy correction due to the interaction of the valence electron and

18

the (1s)2 shell in Li-like ions. Indeed, by using elementary angular-summation rules, we obtain

(2jv + 1) ∆ELi

(2J + 1) ∆EHe

(70)

where ∆ELi

of the electron in the state v and the (1s)2 shell, ∆EHe

v denotes the screened self-energy correction in a Li-like ion due to the interaction
v, J is the screened self-energy correction in
a He-like ion for the (1s v)J conﬁguration (in case of mixing conﬁgurations, a diagonal matrix

element should be taken), and jv is the total angular momentum of the v electron. By employing

the identity (70), we check that our numerical results for He-like ions are in a very good agreement

with our previous calculations for Li-like ions [29].

Our calculations of the screened self-energy and two-photon exchange corrections, combined

with the results for the screened vacuum-polarization from Ref. [37] (with the off-diagonal matrix

elements corrected in this paper, see below), complete the evaluation of the QED correction to

ﬁrst order in 1/Z and to all orders in αZ for n = 2 states of He-like ions. As is known, the αZ

expansion of two-electron QED effects starts with α2(αZ)3. The two-photon exchange correction

contains also contributions of previous orders in αZ that can be derived from the Breit equation.
We separate the “pure” QED part of the two-photon exchange contribution (∆EQED

2ph ) as

∆E2ph = α2[a0 + (αZ)2a2] + ∆EQED
2ph ,

(71)

where ∆E2ph is the total two-photon exchange correction and ∆EQED

α2(αZ)3 and higher. In order to extract numerical values for ∆EQED
from our results for ∆E2ph
2ph

contributes to order

without losses in accuracy, accurate values for the coefﬁcients a0 and a2 are needed. We calculate

them by ﬁtting our results for the two-photon exchange correction obtained within many-body per-

turbation theory. A large number of ﬁtting points and inclusion of fraction values for the nuclear

charge number (up to Z = 0.1) allowed us to achieve better accuracy than in previous calculations

of similar coefﬁcients (e.g., Refs. [17, 50, 51]). The numerical results for the coefﬁcients a0 and a2

for all states under consideration are tabulated in the second and in the third column of Table III,

respectively.

In Table IV we collect all two-electron QED contributions for n = 1 and n = 2 states of

He-like ions. The screened self-energy and two-photon exchange corrections are calculated in

the present work; in the table they are labeled as “Scr.SE” and “2-ph.exch.”, respectively. The

screened vacuum-polarization correction was ﬁrst evaluated in our previous investigation [37]. In

the present work, we correct an error made in Ref. [37] for the off-diagonal matrix element and

19

extend our calculation to the region 10 < Z < 20. Numerical values for the screened vacuum-

polarization correction are listed in Table IV under entry “Scr.VP”.

Our results for the two-electron QED correction calculated to all orders in αZ can be compared

with the results obtained within the αZ expansion, which reads [1, 2]

∆EQED

2el = α2(αZ)3

a31 ln αZ + a30 + (αZ) Gh.o.

2el (αZ)

,

(72)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

where the function Gh.o.

2el (αZ) is the higher-order remainder that is not known analytically at
present. We obtain numerical values for the coefﬁcients a31 and a30 by using formulas from

Ref. [1] and numerical results for the two-electron Bethe logarithms [52] and for the 1/Z-

expansion coefﬁcients of expectation values of various operators [17, 53]. The only coefﬁcient

whose numerical value was not available in the literature was the anomalous-magnetic moment

correction for the off-diagonal matrix element. This is the ﬁrst-order 1/Z-expansion term of the

matrix element of the operator α/π(H ′′′

5 ) (see Eqs. (27) and (28) of Ref. [53]). The result
of our calculation of this correction (denoted in Ref. [17] as ∆Eanom) for the off-diagonal term in

3 + H ′′′

the LS coupling reads

∆ELS

anom(offdiag) = α2(αZ)3 0.010110 .

(73)

Numerical values for the coefﬁcients a31 and a30 for all states under consideration are listed in the

third and in the fourth columns of Table III, respectively.

In Fig. 4, we plot our numerical results together with the contribution of the ﬁrst two terms

of the αZ expansion (dashed line). In addition, we also plot the two-electron QED contribution,

as evaluated by Drake [17] (dotted line).

It was obtained according Eqs. (2)-(9) of Ref. [17],

keeping the contribution of ﬁrst order in 1/Z only. (We note that Eq. (8) of Ref. [17] contains

a misprint; its right-hand-side should be multiplied by Z.) Expressions obtained in this way are

exact to the leading order α2(αZ)3. They also contain some higher-order contributions, due to

all-order results for the one-electron QED correction employed for the evaluation of the EL,1 term

(Eq. (2) of Ref. [17]). We observe a good agreement of our results with the previously known

contributions and conclude that Drake’s values fall much closer to our all-order results than the

pure αZ-expansion contribution.

For mixing states (1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1, Fig. 4 presents a comparison for individual diago-

nal and off-diagonal matrix elements. It should be mentioned that, generally speaking, comparison

of different methods should be performed for the physical energies obtained after the diagonaliza-

tion of the total matrix and not for the individual matrix elements, since matrices with the same

20

eigenvalues can differ by a unitary transformation. We see from Fig. 4, however, that our re-

sults are in a good agreement with the αZ-expansion contributions also for the individual matrix

elements.

An agreement found with the leading term of the αZ expansion offers us a possibility to ob-

tain the next-to-leading contribution, which is not known analytically at present, and in this way

to extend the results of our calculations to lower values of Z. We thus isolate the higher-order

remainder Gh.o.

2el (αZ) [see Eq. (72)] from our numerical data and ﬁt it to the form

Gh.o.

2el (αZ) = a41 ln αZ + a40 + (αZ)(. . .) .

(74)

Fitted values for the coefﬁcients a41 and a40 are presented in the last two columns of Table III. It

should be stressed that these coefﬁcients were obtained in the jj-coupling scheme with the wave

functions deﬁned in case of mixing states by Eqs. (1), (2).

There is a way to check the self-consistency of the numerical results for individual matrix

elements, which allows us to check each two-electron QED contribution separately. We note that,

in the LS coupling, the only contribution to the off-diagonal matrix element to order α2(αZ)3 is

that of the anomalous magnetic moment correction ∆Eanom, Eq. (73). Therefore, for the two-

photon exchange and screened vacuum-polarization corrections, the off-diagonal matrix element

in the LS coupling is zero. In this case, the following identity is valid in the jj-coupling scheme

(to the order α2(αZ)3)

√2[∆E(1s2p1/2)1 −

∆E(1s2p3/2)1] =

∆Ejj

oﬀdiag ,

−

where ∆Ei stand for the corresponding matrix elements. For the screened self-energy correction,

the off-diagonal matrix element in the LS coupling (∆ELS

oﬀdiag) is nonzero and the corresponding

identity reads

√2[∆E(1s2p1/2)1 −

∆E(1s2p3/2)1] + ∆Ejj

oﬀdiag = 3∆ELS

oﬀdiag .

Fulﬁllment of these identities for individual two-electron QED contributions is checked in Table V.

For the screened self-energy and vacuum-polarization correction, the fulﬁllment is obvious from

the table. For the two-photon exchange correction, the difference between the right- and left-hand-

side is very close to 3(αZ)4 eV in all cases listed and, therefore, should be ascribed to higher-order

contributions, for which the identity is not valid anymore.

III. ENERGIES OF n = 1 AND n = 2 STATES OF HE-LIKE IONS

In this section we collect all contributions available to the ionization energies of n = 1 and

n = 2 states of He-like ions. Individual corrections for selected ions are listed in Table VI. A

description of contributions presented there is given below.

Dirac energy. ∆EDirac is the Dirac value for the ionization energy of the valence electron

including the ﬁnite-nuclear-size effect. The energy levels were calculated employing the two-

parameter Fermi model for the nuclear-charge distribution. Parameters of the Fermi model were

expressed in terms of the root-mean-square (rms) radius (see, e.g., Ref. [54]), whose actual values

were taken from Refs. [55, 56, 57, 58]. For each value of Z, the nuclear parameters for the isotope

with the largest abundance (with the longest life time) were chosen. An approximate formula from

Ref. [59] was employed for calculating rms radii for ions with no experimental data available. In

the table, we present also an estimation of the uncertainty of the nuclear-size effect. In all cases

except Z = 80, 82, 83, 90, and 92, this uncertainty was evaluated by taking the one-percent

variation of the rms radius. For the above mentioned exceptions, the rms-radii are supposed to

be known more precisely. In our calculation we employed the following values: 5.467(6) Fm for

Z = 80, 5.504(25) Fm for Z = 82, 5.533(20) Fm for Z = 83, 5.802(4) Fm for Z = 90, and

5.860(2) Fm for Z = 92. The uncertainty of the nuclear-size effect in these cases was evaluated

by adding quadratically two errors, one obtained by varying the rms radius within the error bars

given and the other obtained by changing the model of the nuclear-charge distribution (the Fermi

and the homogeneously-charged-sphere model were employed).

Electron-electron interaction correction. ∆Eint incorporates corrections that can be derived

from the Breit equation. It consists of 3 parts,

∆Eint = ∆E1ph + ∆EBreit

2ph + ∆EBreit
≥3ph ,

(77)

which correspond to the one, two, and three and more photon exchange, respectively. In notations

of Sec. I, the one-photon exchange correction is written as [33, 44]

represents the two-photon exchange correction within the

22

α2(αZ)2 approximation and is given by the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (71), with the coefﬁcients a0

and a2 listed in Table III. The contribution due to the exchange by three and more photons was

evaluated by summing terms of the 1/Z expansion, with the corresponding coefﬁcients taken from

Refs. [50, 51] for the nonrelativistic energy and from Ref. [17] for the Breit-Pauli correction.

One-electron QED correction. ∆EQED

1el

is the sum of the one-loop and two-loop one-electron

QED corrections. The one-loop self-energy correction for 1s, 2s, and 2p1/2 states and Z

26

≥

(including the nuclear-size effect) was tabulated in Ref. [60] by using the method developed by

Mohr and co-workers [14, 61, 62]. For lower values of Z and for the 2p3/2 state, we used a combi-

nation of our own calculation and an interpolation of the point-nucleus results from Ref. [63]. The

Uehling part of the one-loop vacuum-polarization correction was calculated in this work for the

Fermi nuclear model. The Wichmann-Kroll part of the vacuum-polarization correction was tabu-

lated for Z

30 in Ref. [64]. For lower values of Z, it was calculated in this work by employing

≥

the asymptotic-expansion formulas for the Wichmann-Kroll potential [65].

The two-loop one-electron QED correction is calculated to all orders in αZ only for the 1s

state up to now, see Ref. [48] and references therein. For excited states, one has to rely on the αZ

expansion, which reads (see review [66], references therein, and more recent studies [67, 68])

where ζ is the Riemann zeta function, ψ is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function, and

C = 0.577261 . . . is the Euler constant. Great care should be taken employing the αZ expan-

sion for the estimation of the total correction for middle- and high-Z ions, due to a very slow

convergence of this expansion. In addition, it was found lately [69] that the numerical all-order

results do not agree well with the analytical calculations to order α2(αZ)6. A possible reason for

this disagreement [70] can be an incompleteness of the analytical results (85), (86) for the B61

coefﬁcient.

In order to extrapolate the all-order numerical results of Ref. [48] to the region Z=12-39 for

the 1s state and to estimate the two-loop correction for excited states, we separate the 1s higher-

order remainder Gh.o.

2lo (αZ) from the numerical data of Ref. [48]. We observe that this function
is smoothly behaving and can be reasonably approximated by a polynomial. We thus employ a

linear (parabolic) ﬁt to the function Gh.o.

2lo (αZ) in order to extrapolate the higher-order contribution
to the region Z=12-39. For 2s state, we employ the same values for the higher-order contribution

and ascribe the uncertainty of 50% to them. For p states, no analytical calculations for the B61

coefﬁcient exist up to now. We thus separate from the 1s numerical results of Ref. [48] the function

represents the contribution of QED effects of relative

order 1/Z 2 and higher. This correction was evaluated by formulas presented in Ref. [17] sup-

pressing terms that contribute to orders 1/Z 0 and 1/Z. Its uncertainty was obtained by taking the

relative deviation of the QED contribution to order 1/Z calculated according to Ref. [17] from the

24

results of its exact evaluation presented in this work. (The corresponding comparison is presented

in Fig. 4.)

Relativistic recoil correction. ∆Erec consists of the one-electron and the two-electron part. The

one-electron relativistic recoil correction was evaluated to all orders in αZ in a series of papers

[71, 72, 73]. In our compilation, we employed the ﬁnite-nucleus results of Ref. [73] for the 1s

state, the point-nucleus results of Ref. [71] for the 2s and 2p1/2 states, and those of Ref. [72] for

the 2p3/2 state. The two-electron recoil contribution is given by the sum of the mass-polarization

correction and the electron-electron interaction correction to the one-electron nuclear recoil. The

nonrelativistic part of the mass-polarization correction was evaluated by summing the terms of the

1/Z expansion of the matrix element

taken from Ref. [17]. The known relativistic part

p1 ·

h

p2i

of this correction of order (αZ)4m/M [74] was also included. The electron-electron interaction

correction to the one-electron nuclear recoil was taken into account in the nonrelativistic limit. It

was estimated as (

m/M) ∆E2el, where ∆E2el is the total two-electron correction.

−

In the last column of Table VI we present the total values for the ionization energies, which

are given by the sum of all corrections mentioned so far. For lead, thorium, and uranium, the total

values include also the nuclear-polarization correction [75, 76]. Analyzing the main sources of

uncertainties listed in the table, we conclude that in the low-Z region the main error comes from

the two-electron QED corrections, namely from the two-photon exchange contribution. In the

high-Z region, main sources of uncertainty are the one-electron two-loop QED correction (mostly,

the two-loop self-energy correction) and the experimental values for the rms nuclear radii.

In Table VII, the total ionization energies of n = 1 and n = 2 states of He-like ions with

Z = 12

100 are listed. We start our compilation with Z = 12 since this is the point where

the new terms accounted for in our calculation (

α2(αZ)4) become comparable with omitted

−

∼

higher-order effects (

α3(αZ)2).

∼

In Fig. 5, our results are compared with the theoretical values obtained previously in calcu-

lations of different types [17, 20, 22]. Since our evaluation is the ﬁrst one complete to the or-

der α2(αZ)4, it is interesting to analyze the difference between various calculations in units of

α2(αZ)4. First of all, we note a signiﬁcant deviation of our values from the recent results by

Cheng and Chen [22], which arises from an incomplete treatment of QED corrections employed

in that work. The authors evaluate the QED correction to all orders in αZ at the one-loop level,

employing a symmetric model potential in order to account for the electron-electron interaction.

This approximation works reasonably well in the high-Z region, but for ions with 22

Z

≤

≤

36

25

(as presented in the paper), the accuracy of this approximation turns out to be lower than that of

Drake’s approach based on the exact αZ expansion [17]. We mention that a previous investigation

by these authors [19] employed the QED correction as evaluated by Drake. Its results agree well

with those by Plante et al.

[20] and thus are in a better agreement with our numerical values.

For the 1S0 and 2 3P0,1 states, we observe also a distinct deviation of our ionization energies

from the results by Drake [17]. A similar deviation was reported previously in the literature [18,

19, 20], where it was attributed to corrections of order α2(αZ)4 to the electron-electron interaction

that were not accounted for by Drake’s uniﬁed method but can be (to a certain extent) included

by methods based on the no-pair QED Hamiltonian [77]. Irregularities of the Z-dependence of

the plotted difference, which can be observed for S states in the medium- and high-Z region, is

explained by more recent values for the rms nuclear radii employed in the present calculation.

As can be seen from Fig. 5, the best agreement is found with the calculation by Plante et al.

[20]. It is to be noted that the results by Johnson and Sapirstein [18] and by Chen et al.

[19]

obtained by different methods but on the same level of sophistication are in a very good agreement

with the ones by Plante and co-workers. Whereas all these results are incomplete to order α2(αZ)4,

we conclude that the remaining contribution of this order is rather small for all n = 2 states, which

explains a good agreement of these results with the experimental data. Only for the 1 1S1 state, we
observe a signiﬁcant new contribution of about 0.5 α2(αZ)4. We mention, however, that despite

of a good agreement observed for the n = 2 states, the results by Plante et al. are well outside of

the estimated error bars of the present theoretical values for most middle- and high-Z ions.

In Table VIII, we list transition energies for which experimental results are available. Compari-

son is made with the MBPT calculation by Johnson and Sapirstein [18], with the CI calculations by

Chen et al. [19], and with the all-order many-body treatment by Plante et al. [20]. These studies

are, according to our analysis, the most complete ones among the previous calculations. We recall

that in all these investigations QED corrections were taken as evaluated by Drake [17]. The dif-

ference between them, therefore, is related only to the part arising from the no-pair Hamiltonian,

often referred to as the “structure” part.

We observe a generally good agreement of theoretical predictions with experimental data. De-

spite of the signiﬁcant amount of available experimental information, the experimental uncertainty

in the region of Z under consideration is generally larger than the difference between the calcula-

tions analyzed in Table VIII. Among few exceptions are the recent high-precision measurements

of the 2 3P1 −

2 3P1 transition

energy in magnesium (Z = 12) [91], whose accuracy is much higher than that of the theoretical

predictions. However, at these relatively low values of Z, our treatment is basically equivalent to

the previous studies, and the difference between the calculations can not be effectively probed in

comparison with these measurements. When Z increases, deviation of our values from the results

of the previous studies becomes more prominent, but the experimental uncertainty is much lower

2 3S1 transition energies by Kukla et al. [82] demonstrated a 2σ deviation from

for higher Z. A compromise is found to be argon (Z = 18), where the experimental determination

2 3S1 transition and reduces the discrepancy for the 2 3P2 −

2 3S1

An important feature of He-like ions is that they provide a possibility to study the effects of

parity non-conservation [10, 11]. The 2 1S0 −
presently considered as the best candidate for future experiments [13]. The effect is enhanced by

2 3P0 transition in He-like Eu ion (Z = 63) is

the fact that the 2 1S0 and 2 3P0 levels cross each other in a vicinity of Z = 63. Another crossing

point of the levels occurs around Z = 90 but it seems to be less promising for the experimental

observation of the effect. In Table IX we list the results of different theoretical evaluations for
the 2 3P0 −
observed between different theoretical evaluations, which is due to the smallness of the energy

2 1S0 transition energy in ions near the crossing points. A signiﬁcant discrepancy is

difference for these ions. We mention a signiﬁcant deviation of our values from the recent results

by Andreev et al. [40]. In that work, the authors performed an ab initio calculation of the two-

photon exchange correction, whose numerical values agree well with those obtained in this paper.

However, evaluating the total transition energy, the authors used an estimation for the screened

self-energy correction (that was not calculated at that moment), which is the main source of the

disagreement observed.

Summarizing, in this investigation we performed ab initio QED calculations of the screened

self-energy correction and the two-photon exchange correction for n = 1 and n = 2 states of He-

like ions with Z

12. This evaluation completes the rigorous treatment of all two-electron QED

corrections of order α2 to all orders in αZ and signiﬁcantly improves the theoretical accuracy for

≥

the energy values, especially in the high-Z region. Unlike all previous calculations, the results

obtained are complete through order α2(αZ)4; uncalculated terms enter through three-photon-

exchange QED effects (

α3(αZ)2 and higher) and through higher-order one-electron two-loop

QED corrections (

α2(αZ)7 and higher).

TABLE V: Right-hand-side (r.h.s.) and left-hand-side (l.h.s.) of Eq. (76) (for the screened self-energy cor-

rection) and those of Eq. (75) (for the screened vacuum-polarization and two-photon exchange corrections),

in eV. The comparison is valid to the leading order in αZ only. The last column demonstrates that the

difference (r.h.s.-l.h.s.) for the two-photon exchange correction arises predominantly from effects to order

α2(αZ)4.

An analysis of dynamical suppression of spontaneous emission

(February 2, 2008)

It has been shown recently [see, for example, S.-Y. Zhu and M. O. Scully, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76,
388 (1996)] that a dynamical suppression of spontaneous emission can occur in a three-level system
when an external ﬁeld drives transitions between a metastable state and two decaying states. What
is unusual in the decay scheme is that the decaying states are coupled directly by the vacuum
radiation ﬁeld.
It is shown that decay dynamics required for total suppression of spontaneous
emission necessarily implies that the level scheme is isomorphic to a three-level lambda system, in
which the lower two levels are both metastable, and each is coupled to the decaying state. As such,
the total suppression of spontaneous emission can be explained in terms of conventional dark states
and coherent population trapping.

I. INTRODUCTION

Following the work of Fontana and Srivastava [1], Agarwal [2], Cardimona, Raymer, and Stroud [3], and Zhu and
Scully [4], a number of articles have appeared containing proposals for suppressing spontaneous emission [5–12]. In
contrast to the suppression of spontaneous emission that one can achieve by placing an atom in a cavity whose
radiation modes diﬀer from those of free space, it is suggested in these articles that spontaneous emission in free
space can be suppressed by applying an external radiation ﬁeld to an atom having a speciﬁed level scheme. This
is a rather remarkable result, since one might imagine that, owing to the very short correlation time of the vacuum
ﬁeld, such modiﬁcation of spontaneous emission rates would be strictly forbidden. A prototypical level scheme that
leads to suppression of spontaneous emission is that of Zhu and Scully [4] (see Fig. 1). Two excited states

are coupled directly by the vacuum ﬁeld.
What makes the decay scheme somewhat unusual is that states
An external radiation ﬁeld couples an auxiliary, metastable state
. For certain values of
the ﬁeld strength and atom-ﬁeld detunings, it is found that one can have a nonvanishing, signiﬁcant, steady state
probability for the atom to be in states

can be viewed as superpositions of two states, one of which is metastable.

The suppression of spontaneous emission has been explained in terms of a dressed state of the atom-ﬁeld system
that is decoupled from the vacuum radiation ﬁeld [3,4,8,10,11,13]. How is this decoupling accomplished? Is there
any underlying structure in the proposed level schemes that can help one to understand this most surprising result?
It is the purpose of this article to address these questions. By considering a model problem, I will show that states
It is this metastable state

that is necessary for the total suppression of spontaneous emission. Moreover, the decay dynamics required for total
suppression of spontaneous emission implies that the level scheme of Fig. 1 is isomorphic to a three-level lambda
system. The lower two levels of the lambda system are both metastable, and each is coupled to the decaying state.
As such, the total suppression of spontaneous emission can be explained in terms of conventional dark states and
coherent population trapping [15]. The experiment of Xia et al [13] will also be discussed. While the level scheme
they study is relevant to this class of problems, the results they obtained cannot be classiﬁed as a suppression of
spontaneous emission.

In the absence of the driving ﬁeld, the equations for the evolution of the state amplitudes a2 and a3 given by Zhu

and

The ﬁrst question we must ask is whether or not these equations correctly describe the interaction of an atom with
the vacuum radiation ﬁeld. The answer to this question is not obvious. If we consider the energy levels shown in Fig.
1 to be those of an isolated atom in free space, we immediately run into some problems. From the dipole selection
rules, it is easy to show that the vacuum coupling from state
must conserve orbital, spin-orbit, and
total angular momenta L, J, and F, as well as the z-component of total angular momentum. As a consequence,
must belong to diﬀerent electronic state manifolds. This, in turn, implies that ω32 corresponds to a
states
frequency that is orders of magnitude larger than the decay rates Γ2 and Γ3, respectively. The rapid oscillation of state
amplitudes a2 and a3 with frequency ω32 brings into question the validity of the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation
used for the derivation of Eqs. (1). There is, perhaps, a more subtle point involved. Starting from state
, one can
i
emit a photon taking the atom to state
, reemit a photon
taking the atom to state
. This overall process constitutes
i
i
an α5(Rydberg) contribution to the Lamb shift of state
. Consequently, if the atomic states are renormalized to
i
include the Lamb shift, it is questionable as to whether the vacuum coupling in between states
should be
included in Eqs. (1) [14].

It thus appears unlikely that one can achieve the vacuum coupling indicated in Eqs. (1) if these states correspond
to eigenstates of a free, isolated atom, dressed by the vacuum ﬁeld. On the other hand, it is possible to achieve this
vacuum coupling if states
correspond to eigenstates of an atom plus some external ﬁeld or, in some cases,
to the states of a molecule [14]. The most obvious atom candidate is a hydrogen atom in a static electric ﬁeld [16].
States
could then be chosen as linear combinations of the 2S and 3P states of hydrogen. The idea of using
a hydrogen atom in a static electric ﬁeld to modify the spontaneous emission spectrum is not new. Zhu and Scully
mention it in their 1996 article [4], and Fontana and Srivastava gave a detailed analysis of the decay in their 1973
article [1]. Alternatively, one could use a level scheme similar to that used by Xia et al. [13], in which states

of Fig. 1 or 2. It will be seen that the suppression of spontaneous emission can be explained in terms of conventional

This form of the equations is almost identical to that used in theories of suppression of spontaneous decay [compare

Having established that state

must be metastable to satisfy the requirements for spontaneous emission suppres-
sion, it is now an easy matter to understand the total suppression of spontaneous emission by returning to the original
Hamiltonian (3). An inspection of this Hamiltonian reveals that it is identical to a Hamiltonian, written in a ﬁeld
interaction representation [18], that characterizes a three-level atom in a lambda scheme driven by two ﬁelds. The
ﬁeld having Rabi frequency χ and detuning δ = Ω
ωb1 drives the 1-b transition and the ﬁeld having Rabi frequency
V and detuning δ′
ωbd drives the b-d transition [16]. Total suppression of spontaneous emission occurs if one can
ﬁnd an eigenstate consisting of a superposition of state amplitudes a1 and ad which is decoupled from state amplitude
ab. This dark state [15] does not decay since it is a superposition of nondecaying states. In other words we seek values
of α and β for which the superposition of state amplitudes of the form

III. DISCUSSION

It has been shown that the origin of the suppression of spontaneous emission proposed by Zhu and Scully [4] and
others [7,8,10–12] can be traced to a metastable state that is ”hidden” in their calculations. Once this hidden state
is revealed, the suppression of spontaneous emission can be understood in terms of a conventional dark state and
coherent population trapping [15] that can arise when an atom having a three-level, lambda scheme is driven by
two ﬁelds. The dark state in this instance is a superposition of two metastable states so is, itself, metastable. The
dynamical suppression of spontaneous emission is a real eﬀect. If the external driving ﬁeld χ were not present, the
would always decay. In some sense, the driving ﬁeld allows one
two state manifold consisting of states
to access the metastable level
. This type of dynamical suppression could be
i
used, for example, to reduce spontaneous emission in the 2S-2P manifold of hydrogen resulting from stray ﬁelds that
couple the S state to the P state. It would be necessary to drive the 2S-2P transition using an rf ﬁeld and the 1S-2P
with a uv ﬁeld having frequency Ω = ω2S,1S

As was noted above, total suppression of absorption occurs under the same conditions as total suppression of
spontaneous emission, so that the existence of one implies the other. Consequently, if one can demonstrate total
suppression of absorption, the system will also exhibit total suppression of spontaneous emission. To establish total
suppression of absorption, one can either (i) prove that there is no absorption of the driving ﬁeld or (ii) show that
there is no scattered radiation for all polarizations and directions of the scattered ﬁeld. The existence of scattered
radiation in the triplet channel in the experiment of Xia et al. necessarily implies that there is not total suppression of
absorption. On the other hand, the absorption rate from the ground state is decreased by a factor 2γd/(γd +γb) relative

[16] If the levels b and d are separated by a radio frequency, one can replace the static ﬁeld by a radio frequency ﬁeld. In that
case one sets δ′ = ωdb − Ωrf and replaces V by the Rabi frequency of the rf ﬁeld (assuming the Rabi frequency is much
less than ωdb).

[17] Suppression of spontaneous emission still occurs if states |0i and |1i correspond to the same physical state (see Sec. III).

[21] Normally, the reduction of scattering in a single direction does not constitute evidence for the vacuum coupling of the
excited states. The scattering must vanish in all directions. For example, if an incident ﬁeld is tuned between the 3P 1
and
2
3P 3
states of Na, there can be a total suppression of scattering for speciﬁc directions and polarizations of the scattered
2
ﬁeld, even though there is no vacuum coupling of these states. The decrease in scattering in some directions is compensated
by an increase in other directions. In the experiment of Xia et al., however, the existence of scattering in the triplet channel
oﬀers proof that states |2i and |3i each contain an admixture of singlet and triplet states; as such, each can be coupled to
′
states |0i (or |0

i), leading to a vacuum coupling of states |2i and |3i .

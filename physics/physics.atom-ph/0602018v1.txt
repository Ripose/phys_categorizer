Abstract. The decay of inner-shell vacancy in an atom through radiative and non-radiative
transitions leads to final charged ions. The de-excitation decay of 3s, 3p and 3d vacancies
in Kr atoms are calculated using Monte–Carlo simulation method. The vacancy cascade
pathway resulted from the de-excitation decay of deep core hole in 3s subshell in Kr atoms
is discussed. The generation of spectator vacancies during the vacancy cascade development
gives rise to Auger satellite spectra. The last transitions of the de-excitation decay of 3s, 3p
and 3d holes lead to specific charged ions. Dirac–Fock–Slater wave functions are adapted
to calculate radiative and non-radiative transition probabilities. The intensity of Kr4+ ions
are high for 3s hole state, whereas Kr3+ and Kr2+ ions have highest intensities for 3p and
3d hole states, respectively. The present results of ion charge state distributions agree well
with the experimental data.

Introduction

pathway, multiple vacancies are generated after each Auger transition. The distribution of gen-
erated vacancies does not dependent on the initial ionization process. The Auger cascades are
accompanied with emission of photon spectra or electron spectra for each pathway branch. The
spectra are conditioned by the transition rates and transition energies of multi-vacancy states.
The generation of vacancies in the course of de-excitation cascade is accompanied by characte-
ristic energy shifts in the electronic levels. The influence of the additional vacancies during the
cascades may close some low-energy Auger channels (forbidden energies). Understanding the
influence of the spectator vacancies on Auger transitions, gives more detailed information about
the vacancy cascade development. The overlapping spectra emitted from parallel branches of the
de-excitation cascades lead to different low-energy highly charged ions. These low-energy ionic
charges are important in the field of astrophysical plasma [1]. Study of ion charge state distribu-
tions following inner-shell ionization of atoms provides information to estimate the characteristic
relaxation time constants and thermal equilibrium of ion gas that stored in trap [2, 3, 4]. The ion
charge state distributions following inner-shell ionized rare gas atoms are measured using both
energy ionization from x-ray tube [5, 6], and synchrotron radiation [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Tamenori et

al. [12] measured the branching ratio of multiply charged ions formed through photoionization
of Kr 3d, 3p and 3s subshells using a coincidence technique. The calculations of ion charge
state distributions resulted after core-hole creation of atom are carried out by many researchers
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

The Auger transition rates and transition energies in multi-ionized neon atom are measured
using heavy-ion and electron bombardment [23] and calculated using Hartree–Fock–Slater wave
functions [24]. Larkins [25] investigated the influence of multi-vacancy states on the electron
binding energies and transition rates in K, L, and M subshells in the calculation of ion charge
state distributions. Auger and x-ray spectra formed during vacancy cascades are calculated using
Monte–Carlo method [26, 27]. Cooper et al. [28] measured and calculated the L23MM Auger
spectra of argon excited at energies between those of K- and L-thresholds and affected by L1L23M
intermediate transition. The L23MM Auger spectra of argon emitted after photoexcitation are
measured using broad-band synchrotron radiation of energies largely lying above the K-shell
ionization potential [29].

In the present work, the different ionic charges followed 3s, 3p and 3d subshells photoioniza-
tion of Kr are calculated using Monte Carlo simulation technique. The calculation is considered
an extension to the previous work carried out by Abdullah et al. [21], in which ion charge state
distributions yield after 1s, 2s and 2p vacancy creation in Kr atoms are obtained. The de-
excitation decay branches of parallel Coster–Kronig and Auger transitions followed 3s, 3p and
3d hole production are discussed. The Auger transition rates and electron shake off are ob-
tained using Dirac–Fock–Slater wave functions. The present results are compared with available
theoretical [16] and experimental values [12].

2 Method of calculations

The highly excited atoms resulted after electron emission from inner-shell will rapidly relax back
to a lower energy state by radiative or non-radiative process. In case of radiative transition, the
vacancy transfers to a higher shell under emission of characteristic x-rays:

A + hν −→ (A1+)∗ + ep −→ (A1+)∗ −→ A1+ + hν′,

where the core hole in the target atom A is produced by photoionization (hν), (A1+)⋆ is the
atom in highly excited state and ep is the primary emitted electron. If the vacancy is filled via
Auger transition, two vacancies in the higher shells of atom will be created and the transition
is given by:

A + hν −→ (A1+)∗ + ep −→ (A1+)∗ −→ A2+ + eAuger,

where A2+ is doubly ionized atom.

In an Auger transition, one electron falls from a higher level to fill the initial vacancy and
another electron is ejected into continuum. The kinetic energy of emitted Auger electron can be
estimated from the binding energies of the various levels involved in the transition:

EKin = Ei − (Ej + Ek),

where Ei is the binding energy of initial state, Ej is the binding energy of electron filling the
hole and Ek is the binding energy of the electron leaving the atom.

The simulation of the cascade branches is based on the selection of all possible radiative and
non-radiative branching ratios that may fill the inner-shell vacancies in atoms. The radiative
branching ratio is defined as the probability that the vacancy in an atom is filled through x-ray
transitions (photon emission), while the non-radiative branching ratio is defined as the vacancy

The calculations of radiative transition rates are performed for singly ionized atoms using mul-
ticonfiguration-Dirac–Fock (MCDF) wave functions [30]. The non-radiative transition rates and
electron shake off processes are computed using Dirac–Fock–Slater (DFS) wave functions [31].
The Monte–Carlo simulation technique is described in detail by Abdullah et al. [21], in
which the electron shake off process is considered. In radiative transitions case, the inner-shell
vacancy will transfer to higher shell under emission of characteristic x-rays without changing
the number of vacancies thus a new position of vacancy is created. If the vacancy is filled via
Auger process, two vacancies in the higher shells of atom will be generated. The de-excitation
decays are repeated until all vacancies reach the outermost shell and no transitions are possible.
The successive Auger cascades lead to the production of specified low-energy charged ions. The
Auger cascades correspond to transitions with emission of photon spectra or electron spectra for
each pathway branches. In the course of cascade development, Auger spectra arise from spectator
vacancies left by preceding Auger transitions and by electron shake off process accompanying
the Auger transitions.

3 Results and discussions

Fig. 1 shows a schematical diagram for all main de-excitation decay pathway resulted after 3s
vacancy creation in Kr atom. The solid arrows indicate the selected Auger channels follo-
wing inner-shell ionization, while dotted ones show the Coster–Kronig channels. The solid line
indicates the radiative transition; while dotted lines indicate the electron shake off processes
occuring due to the change of atomic potential after primary ionization or after Auger and
Coster–Kronig transitions. Electron shake off process resulted from the initial ionization or de-
excitation decay produces additional vacancies in higher shells leading to an increase in the
number of vacancies. Auger and Coster–Kronig transitions are indicated outside the brackets,
while the spectator vacancy configurations are indicated inside the brackets. Each branch of
the de-excitation leads to an ion of a specific charge as shown in the diagram. Considering of
electron shake off process in the calculation gives a final charge state of ions which agree well
with the experimental data.

Fig. 2 shows the charge state of ions resulted after 3s vacancy creation in Kr atoms. The
present results are compared with other theoretical values from Kochur et al. [16] and experi-
mental data from Tamenori et al. [12]. The relaxation of ionized atom occurs through radiative
and/or non-radiative transitions. At 3s hole state in Kr atoms, the probability of radiative tran-
sitions is lower than the probability of non-radiative transitions. The radiative branching ratios
will occur in 1 % of the cases as given by the fluorescence yield. In the remaining 99 % of the

cases, the 3s vacancy is filled by non-radiative processes (Auger and Coster–Kronig transitions).
The ionization of the N valence electron through radiative transitions leads to the formation
of Kr1+ ions. The intensity of singly charged ions followed 3s hole creation is less than 1 %.
The 3s hole is filled by one of three possible M1M23N, M1M45N Coster–Kronig transitions and
M1NN Auger transition. At 3s hole state, the probability of super Coster–Kronig transitions
M1MM is lower than the probability of Auger and Coster–Kronig transitions. The decay of 3s
vacancy through Auger or Coster–Kronig channel will create an additional vacancy in N sub-
shells. The generation of N vacancy produced during vacancy cascade leads to characteristic
energy shifts in the energy levels. This additional N vacancy closes low-energy super Coster–
Kronig M1MM channels and these channels become energy forbidden. The relative transition
probability (branching ratio) for M1M23N, M1M45N and M1NN decays are 72 %, 26 % and 1.5 %,
respectively. The intensity of doubly charged ions Kr2+ at 3s hole state is about 2 %. The yield
of Kr3+ ions with intensity of 12 % arises from Coster–Kronig channels and subsequent Auger
transitions following 3s hole creation. The formation of Kr4+ is caused by initial M1M23N
Coster–Kronig transition and subsequent Coster–Kronig transition from M23M45N shell and
M45NN Auger transition. During the vacancy cascade de-excitation, the intensity of M45NN
Auger spectra with additional [N2] vacancies is high. The 3s ionization significantly produces
quadruply charged (Kr4+) ions via Coster–Kronig decays with subsequent Auger transitions.
The intensity of quadruply charged ions resulted from 3s vacancy is 61 %. The spectator va-
cancies [N] decrease the energy of M45NN Auger transition by several electron volts. This is
because the spectator vacancies change the shielding of the M and N levels. The strongest
line spectrum arise from M45[N2] − NN[N2] transitions and leads to a stable Kr4+ ions. The
Kr5+ and Kr6+ ions are formed from the de-excitation via parallel Auger and Coster–Kronig
channels and electron shake off process. The intensities of the Kr5+ and Kr6+ ions are 21 %
and less than 4 %, respectively. It is found that the creation of additional N vacancies during
the de-excitation decay of 3s hole closes the M23M45M45 super Coster–Kronig channel, i.e. the
super Coster–Kronig transition energy is forbidden. The intensity of Kr4+ and Kr5+ ions is
high while a Kr1+, Kr2+, Kr3+ and Kr6+ ions is low. The most probable de-excitation pathway
of a 3s shell vacancy is via Coster–Kronig transitions, which will create M45 vacancies with
additional N sub-shell vacancies. So each spectator vacancy configuration will give rise to an
M45NN satellite spectrum. The present results of ion charge state distributions after 3s vacancy
production agree well with the experimental data [12].

The ion charge state distributions produced after 3p hole creation in Kr are shown in Fig. 3.
The de-excitation decay of 3p hole gives rise to different ionic charges Krq, q = 1, . . . , 5. The

3p hole is filled by one of the following possible transitions: M23M45M45 super Coster–Kronig,
M23M45N Coster–Kronig and M23NN Auger transitions. The relative transition probability
(branching ratio) for M23M45M45, M23M45N and M23NN decays are 61 %, 29 % and 2 %, respec-
tively. In the 3p hole state, the ionization of the 3p electrons increases the intensity of triply
charged ions Kr3+ and decreases the quadruply charged ions Kr4+ in comparison with the
corresponding charged ions that produced after 3s vacancy. The formation of Kr1+ is caused
by radiative transition with ionizing electron from N subshells. The intensity of Kr1+ ions
after 3p shell ionization is less than 1 %. The decay of 3p vacancy via normal M23NN Auger
transition leads to the formation of doubly charged ions Kr2+ with an intensity of 3 %. The
formation of Kr3+ ions occurs from the decay of 3p hole via initial Coster–Kronig channel and
subsequent Auger transition. The triply charged ions Kr3+ followed after the 3p ionization has
highest intensity (66 %). The Kr4+ ions with intensity of 25 % are formed via Coster–Kronig,
Auger transitions and electron shake-off from N shell. The probability of electron shake off from
N shell after 3p ionization is about 7 %. The intensity of Kr5+ ions yields from vacancy cascade
followed 3p hole production is 5 %. In general, the de-excitation decay of 3p hole of Kr leads to
dominant production of Kr3+ and Kr4+ charged ions and lower production of Kr2+ and Kr5+
ions, respectively.

The percentage fraction of the ion charge state distributions yields from de-excitation decay
of 3d hole in Kr are shown in Fig. 4. The highest intensity Kr2+ ions formed from de-excitation
decays of 3d photoionization. The de-excitation decays of 3d vacancy yields Kr2+ with higher
intensity and Kr3+ ions with lower intensity in comparison with the corresponding results from
3p vacancy. The intensities of doubly and triply charged ions are 66 % and 35 %, respectively.
It is important to mention that the present results of ion charge state distributions produced
after 3s, 3p and 3d vacancies production in Kr atoms agree well with the experimental data
from Tamenori et al. [12].

4 Conclusions

The core hole creation followed by successive Auger, Coaster–Kronig transitions and electron
shake off leads to different ionic charge. Monte Carlo simulation method is performed to cal-
culate the highly charged ions after 3s, 3p and 3d vacancies creation in Kr atom. The Auger
and Coster–Kronig branching ratio and electron shake off process are calculated using Dirac–
Fock–Slater wavefunctions. The cascade of decay pathway branches followed 3s, 3p and 3d holes

are discussed. The Kr4+ ions have highest intensity in the 3s shell ionization, while Kr3+ and
Kr2+ ions have the highest intensity in the 3p and 3d shell ionization, respectively. The present
results are compared with other theoretical values [16] and experimental [12] and are found to
agree well with the experimental values.

Abstract. Building on insights about the classical pathways to double ionization in
strong laser ﬁelds we here propose a 1+1-dimensional model that captures essentials
of the 3-d potential landscape and allows eﬃcient studies of the process in reduced
dimensions. The reduction to one degree of freedom for each electron is obtained by
conﬁning their motion to lines at an angle of π/6 with respect to the ﬁeld axis; the
justiﬁcation for this choice is that upon variation of the electric ﬁeld the Stark saddles
move along the same lines. In this way we obtain a low-dimensional representation in
which symmetric electron escape is possible. As a demonstration of the advantages of
this model we conﬁrm numerically the equivalent of the Wannier threshold behaviour
for constant electric ﬁeld and identify several classes of trajectories that can contribute
to the ionization process.

Introduction. Analyzing the dynamics of two-electron systems remains a
challenge because of the high dimensionality of the conﬁguration space, especially when
highly excited states are involved, as in the case of strong ﬁeld double ionization. Taylor
group managed to obtain results for a full 3+3-dimensional representation, albeit mostly
at short wave length [1, 2]. 1+1-dimensional models with both electrons aligned along
one axis [3, 4, 5, 6] are attractive (as reﬂected in a large number of publications based
on this model), but physically ﬂawed since the electron repulsion prevents an escape in
the experimentally observed subspace of equal momenta [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Among
the alternatives that have been considered are models where the center of mass of the
electrons is conﬁned to move along the axis [14]: they might be classiﬁed as 1.5+1.5
dimensional, since the position of an electron along the ﬁeld axis qualiﬁes as a full
degree of freedom and the perpendicular one, being shared with the other electron, as
half a degree of freedom. It is our aim here to present and analyze a model with further
constraints on the dynamics; the model nevertheless captures several essential features
of the full dynamics and allows eﬃcient simulations.

The model is suggested by our previous analysis of the classical pathways to non-
sequential double ionization in strong laser ﬁelds [15, 16, 17]. We found that the observed
symmetric escape can be explained by the escape over a symmetrically arranged saddle.
As the ﬁeld changes, the saddle moves along lines that keep a constant angle with

respect to the polarization axis. Conﬁning the electrons to run along 1-d tracks that
pass through the saddles gives a model for 1+1 dimensional electron dynamics that has
a potential landscape topology very similar to that for electrons in the full 3-d case.
While the potential turns out to be very similar to the so called aligned-electron model
[3, 4, 5, 6], it has one signiﬁcant diﬀerence: since the electron tracks separate as they
move away from the nucleus electron repulsion diminishes as the electrons go out. Thus,
the diagonal where the two electron coordinates are equal, is accessible and not, as in the
aligned model, suppressed by electron repulsion. This allows to mimic a key feature of
the observed double ionization dynamics, namely the preference for symmetric electron
escape [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

In the present publication we analyze the model classically for the case of a static
electric ﬁeld. The static ﬁeld forms a local maximum in the potential energy (that
corresponds to the saddle in the 3-d case [15]) close to which simultaneous escape of
electrons takes place. If the energy of the system equals the energy of the stationary
point only purely symmetric electron motion leads to the simultaneous escape. For
higher energy some deviations from the symmetric motion are allowed. The stability
analysis of the saddle point in the full 3-d case allowed us to predict the dependence of the
classical cross section for the process on energy close to the threshold [17], i.e. to obtain
the Wannier threshold law [18, 19, 20] in the presence of the external ﬁeld. However,
the results of the local analysis were diﬃcult to verify in 3-d numerical simulations. The
key features of the 3-d potential are present in our 1+1 dimensional model that allows
us to obtain also the threshold law and moreover verify it in numerical simulations.

The model. We begin with a reminder of the saddle conﬁgurations in the
symmetric subspace in the 3-d case [15, 16, 17]. Assume the external electric ﬁeld points
in the z-direction and the electrons are labeled i = 1, 2 with positions ri = (xi, yi, zi).
Then the Hamiltonian, in atomic units, is

Let the electrons be moving in the x-z-plane, symmetric with respect to the ﬁeld axis.
Then their positions are (x, 0, z) and (

This potential energy has a saddle at xs = 31/4/(2√F ), zs = 33/4/(2√F ), with energy
33/42√F . Note that if we allow for variation of the ﬁeld strength (like, e.g., in a laser
−
ﬁeld) the saddle moves along lines with zs/xs = √3 =const. Because simultaneous
electron escape takes place in the vicinity of the saddle, the idea is then to assume
that the electrons move in a plane, yi = 0, with coordinates constrained exactly by this
relation, z2
i . This leaves only one degree of freedom for each electron, called r1
and r2:

The equipotential contours for F = 0.02 are plotted in Fig. 1; the stationary point near
r1 = r2
9.3 is clearly visible. There is a symmetric subspace in the full phase space of
the 1+1 dimensional system and the stationary point lives in this subspace. That is, if
initial conditions are chosen symmetrically, i.e. r1 = r2 and p1 = p2, the electron motion
remains symmetric in time evolution. Trajectories that pass close to the stationary point
and suﬃciently close to the symmetric subspace lead to simultaneous electron escapes.

located at (5), i.e.
the stationary point in the full phase space allows us to determine the behaviour of the
cross-section for simultaneous electron escape close to the threshold [17]. There are two
Lyapunov exponents of the point. The ﬁrst,

with the eigenvector in the symmetric subspace, corresponds to a simultaneous motion
of the electrons in the same direction away from the nucleus. Borrowing terminology
from chemical reactions, we call this subspace the reaction coordinate. Because of the
repulsion between electrons, there is an additional unstable direction, with Lyapunov
exponent

λ⊥ =

which enters in the threshold law.
If the initial energy of the system equals the
stationary point energy only a trajectory living in the symmetric subspace can lead
to a simultaneous escape of both electrons. This reduces the dimensionality of the
problem and the cross-section vanishes. For higher energy some deviations from the
symmetric motion are possible, giving a ﬁnite volume of initial conditions and a non-
vanishing cross-section. The dependence of the cross-section on energy σ(E) close to
the stationary point energy Vs can be obtained in the spirit of the Wannier analysis
[17, 18, 19, 20, 21], resulting in

1.354 .

This is larger than the corresponding exponent in the full 3-d case where, for a doubly
charged remaining ion, the exponent is 1.292 [17]. The cross section is larger if the
if the saddle is crossed more quickly (larger λr) or if the
exponent is smaller, i.e.
diﬀerences from the symmetric motion grow more slowly (smaller λ⊥). This cross section
exponent is an additional characteristic of the double ionization process.

Numerical results. The derivation of the cross section exponent (10) for the
simultaneous electron escape is based on the local analysis of the stationary point of the
system. One may wonder if the higher order terms can modify the behaviour of the cross
section. To test the results of the local analysis we can perform numerical simulations
of the process. In the 3-d case considered in Ref. [17] that was quite diﬃcult due to
high dimensionality of the problem. Here, we deal eﬀectively with the three dimensional
phase space and the numerical simulations become feasible.

In order to avoid problems with the Coulomb singularities, we can add cut-oﬀs in

the denominator, so that the potential becomes

The cut-oﬀs change slightly the prediction for the threshold exponent which now equals
µ = 1.357 (for F = 0.02). We have run trajectories with initial conditions chosen
microcanonically for diﬀerent energies E above the threshold energy Vs but with an
additional requirement that they have to lie on the surface r1 + r2 = 0. We deal with
an open system and the condition r1 + r2 = 0 ensures that the trajectories start in

In Fig. 2 we have included only trajectories leading to simultaneous escape of both
electron. However, it is possible that the ﬁrst electron ionizes by passing close to the
stationary point while the other one is returned and after revisiting the nucleus ionizes
too. Actually there is a separatrix that divides the phase space into areas corresponding
to simultaneous escapes and escapes with a single revisit of the nucleus. The separatrix
consists of trajectories where the ﬁrst electron escapes while the other one approaches a
single electron Stark saddle and looses its kinetic energy. Finally, when the ﬁrst electron
is gone, the other electron remains at the single electron saddle with no kinetic energy.
In Fig. 3 there are examples of ionized trajectories and trajectories belonging to the
separatrix. All trajectories in Fig. 3 correspond to: F = 0.02, energy E = Vs + 0.1,
symmetric initial momenta p1 = p2 and positions lying on a circle, i.e. r1 = (rs/2) cos α

another separatrix appears that separates double ionization trajectories with single and
double revisit of the nucleus. This separatrix (see Fig. 3) consists of trajectories where
the second electron after revisiting the nucleus approaches the single electron Stark
saddle loosing its kinetic energy so that ﬁnally it stands on the saddle. With further

Conclusions. The analysis of pathways to non-sequential double ionization of
atoms in strong ﬁelds [15, 16, 17] allows us to propose a 1+1 dimensional model of the
process. In the present publication we analyze the model in the case of a static electric
ﬁeld. The Wannier threshold law for simultaneous electron escape in the presence of
the static ﬁeld is derived and tested numerically. We also identify separatrices that
divide the phase space of the system into areas of simultaneous electron escapes and
double escapes with a multiple revisit of the nucleus by one of the electrons. In classical
mechanics these diﬀerent trajectories contribute independently to the double ionization
process. In quantum mechanics one may expect interesting coherence eﬀects resulting
from interference of the diﬀerent paths.

The model is considered classically and for a static external ﬁeld only. However,
quantum calculations of double ionization in strong laser ﬁeld [22, 23, 24] including:
electron tunneling, rescattering and subsequent double escape can be performed
numerically very eﬃciently within the model. As we have mentioned in the introduction
the crucial advantage of the model over the well known aligned electron model [3, 4, 5, 6]
is that it does not forbid symmetric simultaneous escapes of electrons what is observed
experimentally and what can not be described by the aligned electron model due to an
overestimation of the Coulomb repulsion.

Quantum coherence eﬀects in atomic three-level sys-
tems interacting with two monochromatic laser ﬁelds pro-
vide a rich source of interesting phenomena in laser spec-
troscopy, for instance, the phenomena of electromagnet-
ically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA)
[1], etc. Complete coherent control of the polarization
state of an optical ﬁeld [2], measurement of the optical
rotation to investigate the atomic parity nonconservation
in thallium vapor [3], and measurement of birefringence
at 1083 nm in 4He atoms [4] have been achieved relying
on the EIT eﬀects in the corresponding cascade three-
level atomic systems. Recently, Magno and coworkers [5]
proposed a simple scheme for laser cooling of alkaline-
earth and ytterbium atoms using a two-photon 1S0 ↔
1P1 ↔ 1S0 cascade transition, which might be used as a
second stage cooling after precooling with the 1S0− 1P1
transition, and this two-photon laser cooling scheme has
not been realized yet experimentally.

In this paper, we present a Doppler-free two-photon
atomic coherence spectroscopy of Yb atoms associated
with the wavelength-mismatched cascade scheme consid-
ered in the two-photon cooling of Yb atoms [5]. We in-
vestigate the Doppler-free transmission spectrum of two
p and σ−
circular polarization (σ+
p ) components of strong
probe ﬁeld at ﬁxed detuning from one-photon resonance
in a Yb hollow cathode lamp (HCL) depending on the
detuning of circularly polarized (σ−
c ) counterpropagat-
ing coupling ﬁeld from two-photon resonance. We ﬁnd
that when the Rabi frequencies of the probe and cou-
pling ﬁelds are similar to the decay rate of the J = 1
state, σ+
p component exhibits a narrow electromagneti-
cally induced absorption (EIA) spectrum, while σ−
p com-
ponent exhibits an electromagnetically induced trans-
parency (EIT) spectrum due the multiphoton process in-

duced via the strong probe ﬁeld. The measured spec-
tra show qualitative agreement with the calculated spec-
tra from numerical solutions of semiclassical density ma-
trix equations. A sensitive Doppler-free dispersive signal
which is proportional to the birefringence experienced by
two circular polarization components of the probe ﬁeld
is then subsequently obtained by detecting the Stokes
parameter [6] of the transmitted probe ﬁeld. This is
the ﬁrst measurement, as far as the authors know, of
the electromagnetically induced birefringence originated
from the EIA-type resonance of the strong probe ﬁeld in
the wavelength-mismatched three-level cascade system.
Finally, we are able to stabilize the frequency of coupling
laser at 1077 nm by use of the laser induced birefringence
(LIB) signal with long-term stability below 1 MHz, which
is stable enough to study the two-photon laser cooling of
Yb atoms in a Yb magneto-optical trap (MOT) [7].

Figure 1(a) and (b), respectively, show the three-level
cascade scheme of Yb atoms having m-degenerate sub-
levels |2i and |3i relevant to the present study and
In
the schematic diagram of the experimental set-up.
Fig. 1(a), the levels |1i, |2i, and |4i form a three-level cas-
cade wavelength-mismatched conﬁguration and the level
|2i and |3i are coupled to the ground state |1i by an arbi-
trarily intense probe ﬁeld. Here we ignore the state with
mJ = 0 of the 1P1 state for simplicity, but include it for
the numerical calculation (see later) [8]. In parenthesis
on Fig. 1(a), laser frequency, polarization state, and Rabi
frequency of the driving ﬁelds are shown explicitly. The
1P1 state (levels |2i and |3i) decays rapidly with decay
rate γa = 2π × 28 MHz to the level |1i and there is a
weak decay channel to the (6s6p)3P1 state via the lev-
els (6s5d)3D1 and 3D2 (not shown), and the 3P1 state
decays to the ground state by emitting 556 nm sponta-
neous photons with decay rate 2π × 182 kHz. The level
|4i decays predominantly to the 1P1 state with decay
rate γb = 2π × 3.0 MHz and weakly to the 3P1 state with
decay rate of 2π × 0.2 MHz [9].

Note that in Yb cascade three-level conﬁguration in
Fig. 1(a), where ωp ∼ 2.7×ωc, the eﬀects of mismatching
wavelength in the EIT spectrum in Doppler-broadened
media is expected to be very strong [10], i.e., the depth
of EIT dip is greatly reduced from the complete trans-
parency as opposed to the case when ωp ≃ ωc [11] and
ωc ∼ 1.5×ωp [4]. In this case, the Autler-Townes compo-
nents for nonzero velocity atoms are completely overlap
with line center as oppose to the case when ωp ≤ ωc, thus
one would reasonably expect transparency created on res-
onance to be obscured [10]. This is exactly what happens
in the cascade system of Fig. 1(a) and observed in Fig. 2
below, where we could detect only a few percent contrast
of EIT or EIA signals against Doppler proﬁle only when
the Rabi frequencies of probe and coupling ﬁelds are an
order of the decay rate of the J = 1 state.

Theoretical analysis of the LIB in the same level con-
ﬁguration as in Fig. 1 was discussed previously by Pat-
naik and Agarwal [8] at the weak probe-ﬁeld limit and
wavelength matched-conﬁguration, i.e., ωp = ωc. We
ﬁnd, however, that in the wavelength-mismatched and in-
homogeneously broadened cascade conﬁguration, where
ωp ≫ ωc as in Ca, Sr, and Yb atoms (considered in the
two-photon cooling theory [5]), the LIB signal becomes
negligibly small after Doppler averaging [10] when the
probe ﬁeld is weak. Thus, we can not use the analyti-
cal results discussed in Ref. [8] for the explanation of our
experimental ﬁndings.
In this paper, we demonstrate
that if the probe ﬁeld is strong in this level conﬁgura-
tion two circular polarization components of the probe
ﬁeld exhibit EIA in the σ+
p component which is coupled
to the control ﬁeld and EIT in the σ−
p component which
is decoupled from the control ﬁeld, allowing us to mea-
sure the laser induced birefringence originated from the
EIA-type resonance. This is the ﬁrst observation, as far
as the authors know, of an electromagnetically induced
birefringence associated with the EIA and EIT eﬀects of
the strong probe ﬁeld in the cascade three-level system.
In the experiment, two laser diodes with external grat-
ing feedback are used for the probe laser (PL) and cou-
pling laser (CL), respectively, as indicated in Fig. 1(b).
The atomic temperature in a Yb HCL is estimated to be
∼ 600 K, which gives a Doppler width of ∼ 1 GHz [12].
The frequency of probe laser at 399 nm can be stabi-
lized within the range of probe detuning |δp| < 2γa ∼ 60
MHz by use of a Doppler-free saturation absorption sig-
nal with lock-in detection using a separate Yb HCL. Two-
photon Doppler cancellation, although it is not perfect
since ωp 6= ωc, is achieved with counterpropagating ge-
ometry of the coupling and probe ﬁelds as in Fig. 1(b).
We set the powers of the probe and coupling ﬁelds at Pp
= 85 µW (spot size 67µm, Ωp ∼ 2γa for σ+
p com-
ponents) and Pc = 1.7 mW (spot size 175 µm, Ωc ∼ 4γa),
and the probe ﬁeld detuning at exact one-photon reso-
nance (δp = 0).

p and σ−

We ﬁrst measured the transmittance spectrum corre-
sponding to the two circularly polarized components of
the probe ﬁeld as a function of coupling ﬁeld detuning

δc/γa. For this measurement, we used two detectors
(PD1 and PD2) in Fig. 1(b) and a λ/4 wave-plate ori-
ented at 45 o to the PBS. The ﬁrst column in Fig. 2
shows the typical transmission spectrum expressed as a
contrast against Doppler background (70 % absorption)
corresponding to the σ−
p component in (a) and to the
p component in (b) for the 174Yb isotope in a Yb HCL
σ+
with Ne buﬀer gas (discharge voltage 160 V and current
1.8 mA) [7]. As one can see, the spectrum in (a) cor-
responds to the σ−
p component shows an EIT spectrum
with a line width of ∼ 3γa, while the spectrum in (b)
corresponding to the σ+
p component shows a narrower
(∼ γa) EIA spectrum at the two-photon resonance. Note
that the EIT and EIA spectrum has only a few percent
contrast against Doppler background, which is expected
theoretically for the wavelength-mismatched cascade sys-
tem with ωp ≫ ωc [10]. We also ﬁnd that, as decreasing
the intensity of coupling ﬁeld, the EIA spectrum in (b)
develops into the EIT spectrum as in (a) with reduced
signal-to-noise ratio. However, the σ−
p component which
is decoupled from the strong control ﬁeld exhibits always
an EIT spectrum under the parameter range we have
tested. The EIT spectrum has a line width about 87 MHz
∼ 3γa, which is 1.5 times larger than the width measured
at the Doppler-free saturation absorption spectroscopy
with a same Yb HCL due to the saturation broadening
[7], while the EIA spectrum has much narrow line width
about γa. We calibrated the width of the measured spec-
trum from the known frequency interval (isotope shift) of
the 1S0 − 1P1 transition of Yb isotopes [13]. The narrow
feature of the EIA spectrum may be understood that in
the EIA process higher order multi-path interference is
involved compared to the EIT process, since the probe
ﬁeld is strong [11].

In order to understand theoretically the measured
spectra in Fig. 2(a) and (b), we solved a semiclassical
density matrix equation associated with the level conﬁg-
uration of Fig. 1(a) at the steady state. The equation of
motion for the slowly varying components ρ of the den-
sity matrix ˜ρ may be written by making a transformation
˜ρ → ρ such that ρkk = ˜ρkk, ρl1 = ˜ρl1 exp(−iωpt), ρ4l =
˜ρ4l exp(−iωct), l = 2, o, 3, ρ41 = ˜ρ41 exp[−i(ωp + ωc)t],
where subscript ”o” indicates the state with m = 0 of
the 1P1 level. The matrix equation for ρ is then found to
be [8]

passes through the medium. For a small absorption the
rotation angle ∆θ is given by [6, 8]

The second column in Fig. 2 ((c) and (d)) shows the
calculated transmission spectrum of the probe ﬁeld af-
ter Doppler averaging expressed as a contrast against
Doppler background as a function of δc/γa with the pa-
rameters Ωp = Ωc = 2γa. The calculated contrast of the
probe ﬁeld transmittance against Doppler background
was obtained from the imaginary part of the atomic co-
herence, i.e., Im[ρ31] for σ−
p component and Im[ρ21] for
σ+
p component. The spectrum in (c) shows an EIT spec-
trum as in (a), while the spectrum in (d) corresponding
to the σ+
p component shows an EIA spectrum as in (b)
at the same parameters. The EIA spectrum of the σ+
p
component of the probe ﬁeld can be understood as a re-
sult of higher-order multiphoton interference enabled by
the strong probe ﬁeld [11]. In addition, our experimental
and numerical observations suggest that the σ−
p compo-
nent which is blind to the coupling ﬁeld is also actually
strongly coupled to the σ−
c coupling ﬁeld due to the mul-
tiphoton process induced via the strong probe ﬁeld so
that the EIT spectrum is observed.

Although, as one can ﬁnd, the experimental and the-
oretical spectra in Fig. 2 agree well qualitatively, there
are signiﬁcant diﬀerence in line shape. We attribute this
diﬀerence partly to the unknown discharge eﬀects in the
Yb hollow-cathode lamp and partly to the uncontrollable
imperfections of the polarization elements in the experi-
mental set-up. However, we can reasonably say that the
density matrix equations in Eqs. (1) and (2) correctly
describes the general behavior of the atomic coherence
associated with the three-level cascade system with m-
degenerate sublevels in Fig. 1(a). We want to emphasize
that at the parameter range where Ωp ≪ γa and Ωc ∼ γa,
the calculated transmittances for both σ+
p com-
ponents exhibit white (ﬂat) spectrum after the Doppler
averaging, thus there is no detectable EIT or EIA sig-
nals as contrary to the case when Ωp ∼ Ωc ∼ γa as
in Fig. 2, supporting strongly our observations. There-
fore it is very important experimental and theoretical
observation that only when the intensity of the probe
ﬁeld and coupling ﬁelds are strong, i.e., Ωp ∼ Ωc ∼ γa,
the transmittances of the σ+
p components in the
wavelength-mismatched cascade system exhibit an en-
hanced absorption or transmittance induced by the nar-
row two-photon coherence, resulting in the enhancement
of laser induced birefringence as clearly demonstrated in
Fig. 3(a) below.

p and σ−

p and σ−

Strong coupling and probe ﬁelds, when applied to
an initially isotropic medium containing Yb atoms hav-
ing m-degenerate sublevels, can create birefringence in
the medium. Because, as clearly seen in Fig. 2, the
strong driving ﬁelds create asymmetry between the
susceptibilities χ± of the probe ﬁeld, since χ+(−) =
(2µ/ǫoEp) ρ21(31), where µ is the dipole matrix element
between 1S0 - 1P1 transition, ǫ0 is the permittivity, and
Ep is the amplitude of the probe ﬁeld. That results in
the LIB, i.e, the plane of polarization is rotated when it

∆θ = πkpL(χ+ − χ−) = ∆nkpL/2,

(3)

where kp corresponds to propagation vector of the probe
ﬁeld, L is length of the cell along kp, ∆n = n+ − n−,
n± + iα± = p1 + 4πχ±, and n± (α±) being the refrac-
tive index (absorption coeﬃcient). Using the numerical
solutions for χ±
p from Eqs. (1) and (2), the rotation of
polarization ∆θ of the probe can easily be determined
In order to detect the background-free

dispersive LIB signal experimentally, we used the SPD
in Fig. 1(b).
In this case, the SPD consists of a λ/2-
wave plate and a balanced polarimeter [6]. The conven-
tional way to measure the polarization state after passing
through the medium is to put a linear polarizer in front of
a detector and measure the projected intensity. But, in
that case, it is inevitable to include the eﬀect of circular
dichroism in addition to the rotation of the polarization
axis. In the SPD scheme, however, the λ/2-wave plate ro-
tates the polarization axis of the probe beam by 45 o, and
the balanced detector (polarimeter) which subtracts the
reﬂected and transmitted intensities from the PBS mea-
sures only the rotation of the polarization axis, i.e., the
LIB signal which is linear in ∆θ without background as
long as ∆θ ≪ 1 for optically thin sample, where αL ≪ 1
[6].

Figure 3(a) shows the detected LIB signal at the same
parameter condition as in Fig. 2. The LIB signal has two
distinct features originated from the absorption (disper-
p and σ−
sion) spectrum of the σ+
p components. The nar-
row dispersion feature at the line center with line width
about ∼ γa corresponds to the LIB associated with the
EIA signal observed for the σ+
p component in Fig. 2(b),
while somewhat broad (∼ 3γa) and weak dispersion sig-
nal superimposed on the main LIB signal corresponds to
the LIB associated with the EIT signal observed for the
σ−
p component in Fig. 2(a). Therefore, we demonstrated
for the ﬁrst time the measurement of electromagneti-
cally induced birefringence originated from the EIA-type
resonance of the strong probe ﬁeld in the wavelength-
mismatched three-level cascade system.

Finally, we used successfully the measured dispersive
LIB signal in Fig. 3(a) for the frequency stabilization
of the coupling laser without frequency modulation with
long-term stability below 1 MHz as shown in Fig. 3(b).
Furthermore, by stabilizing the frequency of probe laser
to the diﬀerent isotope of Yb atoms, for example 171Yb,
which is a promising candidate for future optical lattice
clock [7, 14], we were able to stabilize the frequency
of coupling laser to each stable Yb isotope. The two-
photon cooling theory predicts that the minimum tem-
perature of 124 µK for Yb atoms can be reached at the
probe and coupling laser detunings of δp = −γa/2 and
δc = −γb/2 [5], respectively, those conditions can easily
be achieved with the current frequency-stabilized laser
diodes described in this paper.

In summary, we introduced a Doppler-free two-photon

atomic coherence spectroscopy of Yb atoms in a Yb
hollow cathode lamp associated with the wavelength-
mismatched cascade level conﬁguration. We investigated
the transmission spectrum of strong probe ﬁeld at ﬁxed
one-photon frequency, depending on the detuning of cir-
cularly polarized coupling ﬁeld from two-photon reso-
nance. We found that σ+
p polarized component which is
coupled to the upper state exhibits a narrow EIA spec-
trum, while σ−
p polarized component exhibits an EIT
spectrum. Numerical solutions of density matrix equa-
tions show qualitative agreement with the experimental
results. A Doppler-free dispersive LIB signal results from

the EIA-type resonance was obtained for the ﬁrst time
by detecting the Stokes parameter of the probe ﬁeld, en-
abling us to stabilize the frequency of coupling laser with-
out frequency modulation. The Doppler-free two-photon
atomic coherence spectroscopy introduced in this paper
might equally be applied to the alkaline-earth atoms and
should be useful for experimental realization of the two-
photon cooling theory [5].

We demonstrate detection of proton NMR signals with a radio frequency atomic magnetometer
tuned to the NMR frequency of 62 kHz. High-frequency operation of the atomic magnetometer
makes it relatively insensitive to ambient magnetic ﬁeld noise. We obtain magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity
of 7 fT/Hz1/2 using only a thin aluminum shield. We also derive an expression for the fundamental
sensitivity limit of a surface inductive pick-up coil as a function of frequency and ﬁnd that an atomic
rf magnetometer is intrinsically more sensitive than a coil of comparable size for frequencies below
about 50 MHz.

INTRODUCTION

∼

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals are com-
monly detected with inductive radio-frequency (rf) pick-
up coils. Recently, alternative detection methods using
SQUID magnetometers [1, 2, 3] or atomic magnetometers
[4, 5] have been explored. These techniques can achieve
higher sensitivity at low NMR frequencies and oﬀer other
advantages in speciﬁc applications. In particular, atomic
magnetometers eliminate the need for cryogenic cooling
and allow simple multi-channel measurements [6]. How-
ever, most atomic magnetometers are designed to detect
quasi-static magnetic ﬁelds and are sensitive to oscillat-
ing ﬁelds only in a limited frequency range. Previous
NMR and MRI experiments with atomic magnetometers
detected either static nuclear magnetization [4, 7, 8] or
20 Hz) [5].
nuclear precession at a very low frequency (
Recently we developed an rf atomic magnetometer that
can be tuned to detect magnetic ﬁelds at any frequency in
the kHz to MHz range [9] and demonstrated detection of
NQR signals at 423 kHz using this device [10]. Another
technique for detection of rf ﬁelds with atoms is presented
in [11]. Here we describe detection of NMR signals from
water at 62 kHz and discuss issues speciﬁc to NMR de-
tection, such as application of a uniform static magnetic
ﬁeld. The rf magnetometer oﬀers a number of advan-
tages over traditional quasi-static atomic magnetometers.
It can detect NMR signals in a wide range of magnetic
ﬁelds and allows measurements of chemical shifts [12].
Operation at high frequency reduces the magnetic noise
produced by Johnson electrical currents in nearby con-
ductors [13]. In magnetic resonance imaging applications
it increases the available bandwidth and eliminates the
eﬀects of transverse magnetic ﬁeld gradients [14]. The rf
magnetometer also has a number of practical advantages.
It is relatively insensitive to changes in DC magnetic ﬁeld
allowing it to operate in an unshielded or lightly shielded
environment. Unlike previous setups, we did not use µ-
metal magnetic shields in this experiment, relying only
on a thin aluminum rf shield. The magnetometer is also
relatively insensitive to vibrations and laser noise because
it detects alkali-metal spin precession signals at high fre-
quency. We used inexpensive multi-mode diode lasers

mounted on an aluminum plate without vibration iso-
lation. We identiﬁed several technical issues that need
further research, such as improvement in the uniformity
of the static magnetic ﬁeld and reduction of the magne-
tometer dead time after the rf excitation pulse.

We also compare the fundamental limits on the mag-
netic ﬁeld sensitivity for an rf magnetometer and a tra-
ditional inductive pick-up coil. We derive an estimate
for the sensitivity of a surface pick-up coil over a wide
frequency range and compare its optimal performance
with that of an atomic rf magnetometer of similar size.
We ﬁnd that the fundamental sensitivity of an atomic
magnetometer is higher than fundamental sensitivity of
a pick-up coil for frequencies below about 50 MHz.

The principle of operation of the rf alkali-metal magne-
tometer is discussed in [9]. Brieﬂy, it uses a bias magnetic
ﬁeld to tune the Zeeman resonance frequency of alkali
atoms ν = γB (potassium with nuclear spin I = 3/2 has
γ = gµB/¯h(2I + 1) = 700 kHz/Gauss) to the frequency
of the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld. The alkali atoms are op-
tically pumped along the bias ﬁeld and their transverse
spin precession excited by the weak rf ﬁeld is detected

FIG. 2: Comparison of sensitivities of high-frequency atomic
magnetometer: 1) unshielded (solid line), at 75 kHz; 2) with
1/16” aluminum shield (dash-dotted line), at 75 kHz; 3) mu-

with an orthogonal probe laser. The experimental setup
for the magnetometer is shown in Figure 1. Helmholtz
coils are used to cancel the Earth ﬁeld and generate the
bias ﬁeld. The alkali metal is contained in a glass cell that
is heated to about 180◦C with ﬂowing hot air. The sensi-
tivity of the magnetometer near its resonance frequency
is shown in Figure 2. The broad peak in the spectral
density of the magnetometer signal is due to transverse
spin oscillations excited by magnetic ﬁeld noise and other
sources of ﬂuctuations. The width of the peak is equal
to the bandwidth of the magnetometer and its height in-
dicates the level of magnetic noise. In Figure 2 we com-
pare the noise levels of the rf magnetometer operating
in an unshielded environment, with simple eddy-current
shielding using thin aluminum sheets, and inside multi-
layer magnetic mu-metal shields. For comparison, with
a quasi-static magnetometer operating in an unshielded
environment we observed noise of several pT/Hz1/2 [15].
The degradation of the performance for an unshielded
rf magnetometer is much smaller than for a quasi-static
magnetometer and the noise can be further reduced using
a more rf-tight aluminum box.

For NMR detection the water sample was contained in
a 3 cm diameter and 4 cm long cylindrical glass cell. The
cell was placed in a solenoid which created a large ﬁeld
inside for the nuclear spins while producing relatively lit-
tle ﬁeld outside [4, 5]. The solenoid is needed to match
the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins to the Zee-
man resonance of the atomic magnetometer. For eﬃcient
detection of the NMR signal the diameter of the solenoid
should be close to the diameter of the water sample. At
our NMR frequency of 62 kHz the solenoid also needs
to have a relatively high magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity, on

2 for water close to the intrinsic transverse spin relax-
ation time. It is relatively easy to make the solenoid long
enough or add end-correction coils so that the ends of the
solenoid have a negligible eﬀect on the ﬁeld homogeneity.
But we found that near the center of the solenoid the ﬁeld
non-uniformity is limited by variations in the pitch of the
winding. Several solenoids were wound on a 3.5 cm OD
G10 tube with standard gauge AWG22 magnet wire us-
ing diﬀerent methods, including a lathe with automatic
feed control. However, after several winding attempts
we were not able to obtain longitudinal ﬁeld homogene-
10−3 over a 3 cm region. The ﬁeld
ity better than 1
variation along the axis of the solenoid had a rather ran-
dom pattern. We suspect the non-uniformity is caused
by imperfections in the shape of the wire or non-uniform
thickness of enamel insulation. Only a 0.5 µm variation
in the winding pitch is suﬃcient to explain observed non-
uniformity. To improve the ﬁeld homogeneity we added
a short shimming solenoid around the cell which had
a variable wire pitch. With appropriate current in the
shimming solenoid the ﬁeld homogeneity along the axis
10−4. However, the improvement
was improved to 1
in the NMR linewidth was smaller because the shimming
solenoid generated large ﬁeld gradients away from the
solenoid axis. The maximum T ∗
2 for water NMR signals
we were able to obtain was equal to 9 ms at 62 kHz. More
work will be needed in the future on the development of
magnetic ﬁeld coils that create highly uniform ﬁelds over
a large fraction of their volume.

×

We also investigated in detail the dead time of the
atomic magnetometer following an rf pulse needed to tip
the nuclear spins. For a simple linear system the dead
time is closely related to the bandwidth of the response.
As shown in Figure 2, the bandwidth of the atomic mag-
netometer is on the order of 1 kHz and hence one would
expect a dead time on the order of 1 ms. However, for
large excitations the response of the rf atomic magne-
tometer is non-linear. The decay time of the transverse
atomic spin oscillations becomes shorter when the longi-
tudinal spin polarization is reduced due to the eﬀect of
fast spin-exchange collisions [9]. Also, because the atomic
vapor is optically thick, the propagation of the pumping
laser is aﬀected by the degree of atomic spin polariza-
tion. If the atoms are completely depolarized during the
rf pulse, the time it takes to repump the vapor is propor-
tional to the number of atoms and inversely proportional
to the photon ﬂux [16]. In our conditions it takes about
10 ms for the pump laser to polarize the atoms and prop-
agate through the cell.

There are several methods for reducing the dead time
of the magnetometer. One can construct a special rf coil
[10, 17] that creates a large magnetic ﬁeld for the nuclear
spins while generating only a small ﬁeld at the location of
the atomic magnetometer. One can temporarily change
the bias magnetic ﬁeld experienced by the atomic mag-
netometer so the rf pulse is no longer on resonance for
the atomic spins and does not cause signiﬁcant spin ex-

citation [10]. One can also increase the power of the
pumping laser to reduce the transverse spin relaxation
time - similar to Q-damping techniques used with tra-
ditional rf pick-up coils. We have explored the last two
techniques here. We veriﬁed that the alkali-metal polar-
ization is preserved if the magnetic ﬁeld is detuned suf-
ﬁciently far during the rf pulse. It is important that the
bias magnetic ﬁeld is only changed in magnitude, but not
in direction, in order not to excite transverse atomic spin
oscillations. It is also important to minimize the amount
of conductive materials in the vicinity of the magnetome-
ter to reduce eddy currents that prevent quick changes
in the bias magnetic ﬁeld, but this was not easy in our
setup. We found that in the existing setup the simplest
way to reduce the dead time was by increasing the in-
tensity of the pump laser and reducing the density of
alkali-metal atoms. This reduced the repumping time af-
ter the rf pulse to about 3 ms but at the same time also
reduced the sensitivity of the magnetometer.

To further reduce the eﬀect of dead time, NMR signals
were acquired using a spin-echo sequence: a π/2 pulse
followed by a π pulse after a time τ = 15 msec. The
NMR signals were collected in two modes, either using
water that was pre-polarized by ﬂowing it through a per-
manent magnet with a ﬁeld of 140 mT or using water that
was polarized in-situ by a brief application of a 10 mT
magnetic ﬁeld created by a separate pre-polarizing coil
wound around the sample. For the ﬂow-through mode
the turbulent water motion resulted in an increase of
the eﬀective diﬀusion constant, so successive spin-echo
signals had an eﬀective T2 decay constant of 140 msec,
which resulted in a slight decrease of the signal.

The atomic rf magnetometer is intrinsically sensitive
to a magnetic ﬁeld rotating in the same direction as the
alkali-metal atoms [9]. Nuclear spin precession generates
dipolar ﬁelds that can be generally decomposed into two
counter-rotating components of unequal magnitudes. To
obtain the largest NMR signal, the direction of the mag-
netic ﬁeld in the solenoid is chosen so the larger of the
two rotating NMR ﬁeld components is co-rotating with
the atomic spins.

In Figure 3 we show the Fourier transform of the NMR
signal detected with the atomic magnetometer compared
with the signal detected with a traditional rf pick-up
coil, each after 10 averages.
In Figure 4 we show the
time-domain spin-echo signal obtained with the rf atomic
magnetometer after 100 averages. Finally, in Figure 5
we show the NMR signal detected from water that is
pre-polarized in-situ by application of a 10 mT magnetic
ﬁeld for 2.5 sec before each spin-echo pulse.

It can be seen in Fig. 3 that in our data the signal-
to-noise ratio obtained with the atomic magnetometer
is comparable to that obtained with a much simpler in-
ductive pick-up coil. Therefore, one can ask under what
conditions is the atomic magnetometer advantageous for
detection of NMR? To answer this question, we compare
the fundamental sensitivity limits for an atomic magne-
tometer and an inductive pick-up coil. The fundamental

Here we derive a relationship for the magnetic ﬁeld
sensitivity of a surface pick-up coil valid in kHz to MHz
frequency range. To our knowledge, such general rela-
tionship has not been reported previously in the liter-
ature. We focus on the surface coil arrangement since
for applications using such geometry the coil can be re-
placed directly with an atomic magnetometer cell. We
consider a coil with a mean diameter D and a square
winding cross-section of size W
D, as
shown in the inset of Fig. 6. First we consider the low
frequency limit, where eddy current losses and parasitic
capacitance between coil turns can be neglected. Sup-
pose the coil contains N turns of wire with diameter d
that ﬁll the available winding volume Vw = πDW 2. We
ignore small eﬀects due to imperfect ﬁlling of the winding
volume by circular wire so the number of turns in the coil
is N = 4W 2/πd2. The voltage induced in the coil by a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld oscillating at frequency ω is given
by V = BωπD2N/4, while the Johnson noise spectral
16kBT ρDN/d2, where ρ is
density is given by Vn =
the resistivity of the wire material, kB is the Boltzman
p
constant and T is the temperature. Combining these re-
lations we get magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity limited by John-
son noise

Thus, ideal sensitivity of an inductive coil scales with
1/2
w , similar to an atomic magne-
the winding volume V
tometer, as well as the frequency and the diameter of the
coil. The low frequency limit breaks down for frequencies
above a few tens of kHz due to eddy current loses, but
Eq. (2) is useful in giving the best possible sensitivity for
a pick-up coil.

At higher frequencies we must consider the eﬀects of
eddy currents as well as the parasitic capacitance between
coil turns. We follow a detailed treatment of the skin
depth and proximity eﬀects for circular wires given by
Butterworth [18]. For a multi-layer coil the total eﬀective
AC resistance can be written as

where the next to last and the last terms describe the

Since Eq. (2) does not depend on the thickness of the
wire, it seems possible to reduce skin eﬀect and prox-
imity eﬀect losses by using a very thin wire and a large
number of turns to ﬁll the winding volume Vw. However,
another limitation comes from parasitic capacitance ef-
fects. For a multi-layer coil the parasitic capacitance
is dominated by the capacitance between layers. We
model it by assuming that the coil can be separated into
Nl winding layers with self-inductance Li, resistance Ri
and parasitic capacitance Ci in parallel with each layer
[19]. Each layer has Nw wires and N = NwNl. For
D the mutual in-
a surface coil geometry with W
ductance between layers is approximately equal to their
self-inductance, Mij = Li. For a current I ﬂowing
through the coil, the ﬂux through each element Φi =
j6=i MijI +LiI = NlLiI. Then the total impendence of
the coil is Z = Nl(Ri + iωNlLi)/(1 + (Ri + iωNlLi)iωCi).
P
Hence, the coil has a self-resonance frequency given by
ωself = 1/√NlLiCi.

≪

≪

D the self-inductance
For a surface coil with W
of each layer is Li = µ0DN 2
wp(D/W ), where p(D/W )
is a slowly varying dimentionless function on the order
of unity. The capacitance between layers is approxi-
mately given by Ci = ǫ0ǫπDW/s, where s = W/Nl is
the distance between layers and ǫ is the relative perme-
ability of the insulation material between wires. Com-
bining these relationships we ﬁnd the self-resonance fre-
quency ωself = c/(DN
πǫp(D/w)), where c is the speed
of light. Thus, up to factors of order unity, the self-
resonance frequency is determined by the duration of cur-
rent propagation in the total length of the wire, similar
to other types of electromagnetic resonators. In real coils
the parasitic capacitance and mutual inductance vary be-
tween turns, resulting in signiﬁcant broadening of the
self-resonance. To obtain a high Q, coils are always op-
erated signiﬁcantly below their self-resonance frequency
and the number of turns is limited, N

c/Dω.

Another common technique for improving coil perfor-
mance is to use Litz wire made of many strands of very
thin wire connected in parallel. This reduces skin eﬀect
and proximity eﬀect losses while keeping the total num-
ber of turns small. Eddy current losses in Litz wire were
also considered by Butterworth in [18]. Eq. (3) is slightly
modiﬁed,

where n is the number of strands in the Litz wire and d
is the diameter of each strand, also used for evaluation of
z. Litz wire is eﬀective for frequencies below a few MHz,
at higher frequencies it is not practical to make wire with
d < δ.

At higher frequencies one is forced to operate in the
regime d > δ and a simpliﬁed equation for the magnetic
ﬁeld sensitivity can be derived using the asymptotic de-

This can be intuitively understood as the modiﬁcation of
Eq. (2) for the case when the current ﬂows only in the
surface of the coil winding within a skin depth δ.

To estimate the optimal performance for a surface coil
we varied the number of turns and the wire diameter
for given values of D and a square winding cross-section
W
W . We ﬁnd that other cross-sections, such as a
single layer spiral or solenoidal coil with the same wind-
ing width W give a worse performance. For a given ap-
plication the optimal dimensions of the coil are deter-
mined by the distance to the sample and its dimensions.
The parameters of the coil are optimized subject to con-
0.5 ωself and the wire diameter (includ-
straints that ω
ing strand diameter in Litz wire) is greater than 30 µm.
We considered both solid wire and Litz wire with 1000
strands. In Figure 6 we plot the expected magnetic ﬁeld

≤

sensitivity for a surface pick-up coil with D = 5 cm and
W = 1 cm. We also plot the Q of the coil, showing
that the model predicts values of Q that are consistent
with or slightly higher than common experimental val-
ues of Q for room temperature copper coils, as would be
expected for an idealized model. At high frequency Q
increases as f 1/2 [20]. It can be seen that the magnetic
ﬁeld sensitivity of a surface coil is well approximated by
asymptotic relationships (2) and (8) for frequencies be-
low 30 KHz and above 10 MHz respectively. In the in-
termediate frequency range the sensitivity is limited by
the self-resonance eﬀects or the minimum practical wire
diameter. As can be seen in Fig. 6, Litz wire improves
magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity by about a factor of 2 in this
regime.

We also plot in Figure 6 the expected optimized sen-
sitivity for an atomic magnetometer occupying the same
space as the coil with Va = π(D + W )2W/4. The atomic
magnetometer sensitivity has a slight frequency depen-
dence due to changes in spin-relaxation when the reso-
nance frequency becomes higher than the spin-exchange
rate, as discussed in [9]. We ﬁnd that a room temperature
copper RF coil overtakes the sensitivity of a K magne-
tometer at approximately 50 MHz.

×

The model for surface coil sensitivity also gives a good
estimate for the sensitivity of the pick-up coil used in our
NMR experiment. For detection of NMR signals shown
in Figure 3 we used a coil with an average diameter of 3.6
1.6 cm2, wire diameter d = 0.23
cm, cross-section of 1
mm, wire spacing s = 0.5 mm, and N = 400. For these
parameters, the estimated coil magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity
is about 3 fT/Hz1/2 at 66 kHz, close to the optimum
for given coil dimensions. This theoretical estimate is
in a good agreement with actual magnetic noise mea-
surements when the pick-up coil was placed in a well-
shielded aluminum box. When the coil was used in the
NMR setup, the measured noise level was 7 fT/Hz1/2,
equal to the noise level measured by the atomic mag-
netometer under the same shielding conditions. Thus,
it is not surprising that the noise level in Figure 3 is
the same for the atomic magnetometer and the pick-up
coil, both being limited by external noise sources. With
better eddy-current shielding or by using a gradiometric
measurement [6] one can expect to signiﬁcantly reduce

the noise of the atomic magnetometer while the pick-up
coil is already operating near the fundamental limit of its
sensitivity.

It is also interesting to compare the sensitivity of an
rf atomic magnetometer with that of a SQUID magne-
tometer. While at low frequencies SQUID detectors typ-
ically have sensitivity of about 1 fT/Hz1/2, at frequencies
above a few kHz a tuned superconducting resonator can
be used to improve their performance [3, 21]. For exam-
ple, magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of 0.035 fT/Hz1/2 has been
demonstrated at 425 kHz using a 5-cm diameter super-
conducting pick-up coil and a resonator with Q = 105
[21]. Atomic magnetometers have not yet experimen-
tally reached this level of sensitivity, although it is possi-
ble based on fundamental sensitivity limits given by Eq.
(1). On the other hand, they have a larger bandwidth,
which is important for many applications. For example,
in [10] magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of 0.24 fT/Hz1/2 has
been demonstrated for an rf atomic magnetometer with
Q of 103 at 423 kHz.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the ﬁrst detection
of proton NMR signals with an rf atomic magnetome-
ter. The advantages of this technique include relative in-
sensitivity of the rf magnetometer to ambient magnetic
ﬁeld noise and the possibility of measuring NMR chemi-
cal shifts. We also demonstrated in-situ prepolarization
of proton spins, opening the possibility of eﬃcient mag-
netic resonance imaging with an atomic magnetometer
that does not rely on remote encoding [8]. We identiﬁed
several issues that need further improvements, such as
better magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity for compact solenoids
and more eﬃcient damping of magnetometer spin tran-
sients. Finally, we derived a simple relationship for es-
timating the magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of a surface coil
over a wide frequency range. Comparing it with that
of an atomic magnetometer we ﬁnd that atomic magne-
tometers have an intrinsic sensitivity advantage over a
pick-up coil for frequencies below about 50 MHz. Thus,
they are well-suited for detection of NQR signals as well
as for low ﬁeld NMR and MRI.

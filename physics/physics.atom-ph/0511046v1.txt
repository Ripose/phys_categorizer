Abstract: A fully classical explanation of the nonhydrogenic ionization threshold for low angular
momentum Rydberg states of Alkali-metal atoms in a linearly polarized low frequency monochro-
matic microwave ﬁeld is given: the classical equivalent to the quantum rate-limiting step, which is
−5 scaling and which according to the literature initiates what then continues
responsible for the n
as essentially classical diﬀusion, is found.

I. INTRODUCTION

Laboratory experiments [1,2] have shown that while the ionization threshold of high angular momentum Rydberg

where n0 is the initial principal quantum number, follows the hydrogenic behaviour Fth ≃

for low angular momentum states behaves as (3n5
Krug [3–5] have substantially conﬁrmed this picture, even though they were not able to deﬁnitively rule out for low

In the literature it is often found the opinion that this (3n5

1 threshold behaviour is nonclassical: see e.g. Ref. [6]
where the process is described as an essentially classical diﬀusion one initiated by a rate-limiting step which is a Landau-
Zener transition at a quantum avoided crossing. On the other hand we are in a regime where classical behaviour can
be expected on the relatively short time scales of the experiments: ionization of high angular momentum states follows
1; dynamical quantum localization does has no relevance at such low
the classical hydrogenic behaviour Fth ≃
frequencies as the quantum delocalization border is below the experimental ionization threshold [7,8]; tunneling [9]
and multiphoton processes happen at much longer time scales; and ﬁnally avoided crossings -the quantum resonances
1 threshold- are in most cases clearly related
which are the foundation of the quantum explanation given for the (3n5
to easily identiﬁable classical resonances, the magnitude of the splitting being proportional to the width of the classical
resonance zone [10]. The aim of the present paper is to show that a fully classical explanation of the (3n5
1 threshold
exists and thus add to the evidence in favour of such a scaling: on the energy surface of a Rydberg Alkali-metal atom
in a static electric ﬁeld the atomic core potential induces resonances; their overlap -which we shall show happens at
1- brings chaos [11] and if the system is chaotic, a slowly varying ﬁeld cannot be followed
a ﬁeld intensity F
adiabatically [12,13] by the system and energy diﬀusion will ensue.

The paper is thus organized: section II summarizes the quantum explanation found in the literature; in section III
classical numerical simulations are presented which suggest that a classical explanation is also possible; in section IV
the numerical results of section III are explained through a study of the phase space structures on the constant energy
surfaces of an alkali-metal atom in a static electric ﬁeld. Finally in section V the results of section IV are applied to
the case of a slowly oscillating harmonic ﬁeld to derive the experimentally observed ionization threshold. Section VI
summarizes the results obtained.

II. THE QUANTUM PICTURE

0)−

The standard quantum explanation of the (3n5

1 behaviour is given [6,14] in terms of core-induced Landau-Zener
interactions [15] between states of Stark manifolds with principal quantum number diﬀering by 1 and ﬁeld-induced
Demkov-like interactions [16] within each manifold, as exempliﬁed in the qualitative plot shown in Figure 1, which
1 s-state as the electric ﬁeld slowly oscillates at the threshold amplitude
shows the optimal ionization path for a n0 ≫
F = (3n5
1. Interactions which can be approximated by the Landau-Zener model (characterized by ﬁeld dependent
diagonal matrix elements and constant oﬀ-diagonal ones) are marked by circles; interactions which instead can be
approximated by a Demkov-like model (characterized by constant diagonal matrix elements and ﬁeld dependent
oﬀ-diagonal ones) are marked by squares. As the ﬁeld rises the n0, s state ﬁrst undergoes an avoided crossing of

1,
the Landau-Zener type with the highest energy state of the (n0 −
with the lowest energy state of the n0, m = 0 manifold; when the ﬁeld decreases the population distributes among
these three states and -as the ﬁeld approaches zero- among all the states of the two manifolds, due to Demkov-like
interactions. When the ﬁeld rises again, the peak ﬁeld is not high enough to couple the (n0 −
1), m = 0 manifold to
2), m = 0 one; on the other hand several states of the n0, m = 0 get to be coupled to the (n0 + 1), m = 0
the (n0 −
manifold, so that diﬀusion toward higher energies and eventually ionization ensues. The actual ionization rate is not
easily evaluated as the population fraction exchanged at each avoided crossing depends in a nontrivial manner on the
oscillation frequency of the ﬁeld and its peak intensity [17].

1), m = 0 manifold and then, at F = (3n5

0)−

Since, in the experiments performed up to now, high angular momentum states are not excited selectively in the
quantum azimuthal number m, only a small fraction of their population is initially in the m = 0,
1 Stark manifolds,
which are those displaying signiﬁcant core-induced avoided crossings [6], while most of the population is in the
high m manifolds where the avoided crossings are too narrow to induce nonhydrogenic behaviours. Manifolds with
the same principal quantum number n but diﬀerent m are not coupled by the electric ﬁeld; the population of high
angular momentum states is therefore trapped in the high m manifolds and the states themselves display a hydrogenic
ionization threshold Fth ≃

III. PRELIMINARY CLASSICAL EXPLORATION

As we have seen in the quantum description above, because the electric ﬁeld varies very slowly, most of the evolution
is adiabatic, and the results obtained for Alkali-metal atoms in a static electric ﬁeld can be used to analyze the case
of a slowly varying ﬁeld. Our ﬁrst step will therefore be a classical study of the static ﬁeld case. From the discussion
in the above section it is also clear that the case m = 0 is exactly the case where the nonhydrogenic behaviour we
want to investigate appears most clearly; I have therefore chosen to restrict my study to such a case.

The motion of the perturbed system being restricted to a plane, I consider a two dimensional Alkali-metal atom

model [18] in the

where px and pz are the conjugate momenta to the spatial coordinates x and z. The ﬁrst two terms in eq. (1) represent
the Hamiltonian for a Hydrogen atom with zero z component of the angular momentum Lz = 0 (that is: azimuthal
quantum number m = 0) and the last term is the simplest known model for the nonhydrogenic core potential, β being
the core charge and α a parameter proportional to the inverse of the core radius [19]. The values of the parameters
which give the best ﬁt to lithium have been found to be α = 2.13 and β = 2 [18].

We now add to the free atom Hamiltonian (1) a static ﬁeld potential V = F z; the system described by the

Hamiltonian H = H0 + V is invariant under the scaling x

β. Such a scaling would result in a hydrogenic threshold behaviour as can
be easily seen from the scaling for the ﬁeld intensity F ; on the other hand the core parameter α is ﬁxed for each
atom type and therefore cannot be changed. Changing n0 without changing α means changing the relative dimension
of the core to the orbit average radius and results in a non-hydrogenic threshold behaviour as can be seen from
the following preliminary numerical results, presented -in accordance with the current literature- in semiparabolic
coordinates scaled to the initial quantum number n0:

and in their canonically conjugate momenta pu and pv.

My ﬁndings are summarized in Figs. (2) and (3) where single orbit Poincar´e surfaces of section (SOS) for n0 = 40
and n0 = 320 are shown. A SOS for a system orbit is given by the points where the orbit crosses a given plane with
positive (negative) velocity. Those shown are for the (v, pv) plane at u = 0 with positive velocity ˙u = du/dt > 0.
A comparison of the right side of each ﬁgure, for which F n5
0 = 0.32 clearly
illustrates that the fraction of the energy surface a single orbit is able to explore varies as F n5
0; in particular it can
explore the entire surface when F = (3n5
1, as can be seen from the left hand side of both ﬁgures. The form taken

by this exploration is on the other hand diﬀerent in the two cases: outside of the central region, where the chaotic
behaviour ﬁrst becomes evident [18], the n0 = 320 orbit appears much more regular than the n0 = 40 one; this is a
consequence of the fact that far from the nucleus the system is hydrogen-like and therefore scales as F n4
0.

Our aim is to now understand why this happens; we shall do it by applying Chirikov’s resonance overlap criterion

for transition to chaos [11] in a form suitable to autonomous systems [20].

IV. THE CONSTANT FIELD CLASSICAL MODEL

The quantum mechanical studies quoted in section II have shown that the relevant feature in the quasistatic
ionization of alkali-metal atoms is the core-induced avoided crossing between the highest lying state of the n0 Stark
manifold with the lowest one of the n0 + 1 one (in the hydrogen atom, the levels cross because of symmetry [21]).
This avoided crossing takes place at an electric ﬁeld strong enough that the electric ﬁeld potential dominates over
the core potential; it is therefore convenient to consider an (hydrogen-like) atom without core potential in a static
electric ﬁeld as our unperturbed system and the core itself as our perturbation; this puts us out of the range of the
weak electric ﬁeld approximation used in Refs. [22,23].

To apply Chirikov’s criterion it is convenient to write the Hamiltonian in action-angle variables, so that we can
explicitly calculate the characteristic frequencies of the unperturbed system. To do this we ﬁrst write the Hamiltonian
of the unperturbed system (a two-dimensional hydrogen atom in a static electric ﬁeld)

in parabolic coordinates

We have considered only the linear term of the electric potential as the relevant crossing in the corresponding
quantum system takes place in the linear regime of the Stark potential not only for the high angular momentum
states but also for the low angular momentum ones which, due to the quantum defect, display at low electric ﬁelds
only a quadratic Stark shift [25,26].

We can now add the core potential to the above Hamiltonian; to introduce it as a perturbation, we take its Fourier

expansion:

V = A0,0(I, I1) + Σk,k1>02Ak,k1 (I, I1) cos (kλ + k1µ).

where the coeﬃcients Ak,k1 (I, I1) are the semiclassical matrix elements of the perturbation [24]. For the resonant

terms we are interested in, we have -as we shall shortly see- k

(22) therefore becomes independent of I1 and, since I is the classical analogue of the principal quantum number n0,

1.

Obviously, the above argument only tells us that classical resonances are noticeably big only for F >

1;
whether they do overlap and thus generate global chaos on the energy surface is still an open question. To answer
this question we have ﬁrst to ﬁnd the positions of the resonances on the energy surface. Let us therefore place ourself

From Figure (5) it is clear that the widths of the ﬁrst and last resonances will be zero (for 1/(3F0) an integer) or
close to zero, while the other four will be of comparable widths. We now want to compare the average width of these
resonances to the separation of two consecutive resonances, if the former is larger than the latter, the resonances
overlap and we have chaos on the energy surface (Chirikov’s resonance overlap criterion [11]).

To apply Chirikov’s resonance overlap criterion for transition to chaos to autonomous systems, we have to take
into account energy conservation [20]: the resonance width to be considered is the one along the constant energy
containing the resonance center itself; from eq. (14) the versor ¯r tangent to the energy curve reads

Figure (6) shows W/I0 as a function of 3F0I0 for the lithium parameters. The dotted curve is eq. (38); the full curves
are instead the exact scaled widths calculated at I0 = 10 for (from top to bottom) ¯I1 = 0.50, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.05. The
ﬁrst overlap will happen when the ¯I1 = 0.5 width becomes larger than 0.10, that is for 3F0I0 ≃
0.4; to have global
chaos on the energy surface we instead need the extreme resonances to both overlap with their nearest neighbour and
to reach the extremes in I1 of the energy manifold; this happens when the ¯I1 = 0.20 width becomes larger than 0.20,
0.7, in reasonable agreement with the numerical results from section III: the deviation is within
that is at 3F0I0 ≃
the usual factor 2 expected for Chirikov’s criterion. Worth noting is the fact that, as the perturbation is the atomic
core, the resonance width depends on the electric ﬁeld F only indirectly, through the resonance index k1 (see eq.
(30)) and the energy curve shape. The ﬁrst dependence gives the growth of the resonance width, the second one its
slow decrease at high F where on the other hand the linear approximation for the electric ﬁeld potential used in the
Hamiltonian (14) is no more valid.

While eq. (38) shows that the average behaviour depends on the product 3F0I0 only, the details depend on 3F0

and I0 separately: using eqs. (17), (29), (30), (35), and (36), we obtain, remembering that from eq. (31) I

of 3F0I0 for a) I0 = 10 and b) I0 = 60: in both cases the general behaviour is the same: the ﬁrst overlaps happen
for ¯I1 = 0.5 at 3F0I0 ≃
0.41 (see the detail in Fig. (8)) and the entire ¯I1 range is covered by the resonances for
0.7, but the vertical symmetry is much better for I0 = 60; this is easily explained by noting that, because
3F0I0 ≃
of eq.(28), the speed of motion of a resonance toward higher ¯I1 values with increasing 3F0I0 increases with I0, and
that in our approximation the resonance width depends from I1 only through Ak,k1 (I, I1) and is therefore symmetric
in ¯I1 and 1

¯I1 along the resonance curves (k1 = const).

V. THE VARIABLE FIELD CLASSICAL MODEL

Let’s consider a cyclical perturbation of a given system; an action is an (approximate) adiabatic invariant if the
unperturbed frequency of motion of the associated angle variable is much larger than the fractional rate of change
of the perturbation itself [12]; even though there is no change of energy over a whole cycle of the perturbation, the

6

energy of the system changes during the time the perturbation is varied. The opposite limit is that of sudden or
diabatic variation: in this case the energy of the system does not change at all during the time the perturbation is
varied.

In a few words: diabatic variation of a perturbation means that the motion of the unperturbed system is very slow
compared to the rate of change of the perturbation and therefore a whole cycle of the perturbation brings no change
to the system, which had no chance to evolve. Adiabatic variation means instead that the motion of the unperturbed
system is very fast compared to the rate of change of the perturbation so that the system can follow the slowly varying
orbit it is on and again a whole cycle of the perturbation brings no change to the system, apart from a vector phase,
sum of a dynamical part (the integral over the pulse time of the istantaneous frequency for each action) and of a
geometrical part (the so called Hannay angle [27]).

Diﬀerent orbits having diﬀerent periods, adiabaticity depends on initial conditions. Two classes of orbits are
intrinsecally non-adiabatic. The ﬁrst one is that of the seperatrices: orbits with inﬁnite period which separate regions
of phase space characterized by diﬀerent kinds of motion, e.g. rotation and libration for a pendulum. The other class
is that of chaotic orbits, beacause of exponential instability.

The really interesting case is the case in between the two above: in this case motion of the unperturbed system and
rate of change of the perturbation are comparable and the system neither stays still nor evolves along the varying
orbit it was initially on. It instead moves to diﬀerent static perturbation orbits so that in general energy exchange
will ensue.

A particularly interesting such case is when the variation of the perturbation causes the system to non-adiabatically
cross over (either through a separatrix or a chaotic region) from a region of phase space to another where motion is of
a diﬀerent nature; in this case the phase acquired by the system during the adiabatic part of the evolution can play
an essential function in determining the ﬁnal energy (see e.g. [28]).

In our case we slowly vary the electric ﬁeld according to the sine law F (t) = F sin (ωf t) so that the fractional rate of
change reads ωf / tan(ωf t); apart from the cases ωf t = N π, N an integer, where it goes to zero, or ωf t = (2N + 1)π/2
where it goes to inﬁnity [29], we can use the approximate value ωf .

Considering as our unperturbed system a Hydrogen atom in a static electric ﬁeld the frequencies to be considered
would be those associated with the two independent actions I1 and I2: in the electric ﬁeld linear regime, they give
the conditions

which, as in our case F I 3Ii < F I 4

3F I2 = ω0;

The above condition is the exact deﬁnition of the regime we are interested in and is therefore always veriﬁed.

In the case the unperturbed system is instead an Alkali-metal atom in a static electric ﬁeld, we shall distingush

1; and threshold electric ﬁelds F

adiabatic evolution is impossible everywhere.

≪

≃

For low electric ﬁelds the situation is more complicated, as the phase space is mixed: deformed tori and resonance
islands coexist in it; far from the resonance islands the two actions I1 and I2 are still good approximations of the
actual actions of the system and we still have adiabatic evolution for ωf I 3
1; in the regions on the border of the
resonance islands the motion is instead chaotic and no adiabatic motion is possible [30]; ﬁnally, inside the islands
the system is approximated by a pendulum one [11], from eq. (32) we therefore have that, close to the center of an
island, the frequency of motion around the center of the island itself is ωi = Ω
2aAk,k1 (I, I1), so that the adiabaticity
condition reads:

possible also inside the resonance islands themselves.

Let us now see what happens when the electric ﬁeld in our system is slowly increased: from Figs. (7) and (8) we
see that the resonances appear at I1 = 0 and move to higher values of I1 [31] growing in size up to I1 = I/2 and then
decreasising again. This might at ﬁrst sight suggest as a ionization mechanism the trapping of orbits in the resonance
islands which would then transport them and ﬁnally release them either when the resonance islands themselves break
because of overlap with nearby resonances [32] or when the island size decreases (either at high I1 for increasing ﬁeld,
or at low I1 for decreasing ﬁeld). Such a mechanism could in principle work for F < (3n5
1; it would on the other
hand require adiabatic (or quasi-adiabatic) evolution within the resonance islands, which as we have seen is far from
the case for the range of parameters we are interested in: as the motion inside the resonance island is at its fastest
still much slowler than the rate of ﬁeld change, the islands themselves will not be seen by the orbits.
The only possible mechanism is therefore diﬀusion in the chaotic sea, which happens only for F

1. As it
was the case in the quantum description summarized in Sect. II, an actual evaluation of the diﬀusion and ionization
rates does not appear easy: the only data we have for comparison are the numerical ones in Ref. [5] and they show that
over long interaction times the decay of the survival probability is neither exponential, as expected for a completely
chaotic phase space [33], nor algebraic, as expected in mixed phase space [34]. On the other hand, for short interaction
times, while for the near-threshold plot in Fig. 6.8 from Ref. [5] the ﬁgure resolution is too low to extract any data
for comparison, the high ﬁeld plots seem to indicate an initial behaviour still in accordance with the classical decay

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown here that while the ionization of excited hydrogen atoms in a quasistatic monochromatic ﬁeld is
1,
regular, that of low angular momentum alkali-metal atoms is chaotic. Core induced resonances overlap at F
thus triggering chaotic diﬀusion which results in ionization. The motion within the single resonance islands being
extremely slow, the islands themselves are not seen by the system during the pulse and therefore allow no eﬃcient
path to ionization.

The present paper concludes my study in terms of nonlinear dynamics of the ionization mechanisms for excited
Alkali-metal atoms in microwave ﬁelds initiated in Ref. [8] and prompted by the individuation of three diﬀerent
regimes in the numerical studies by A. Buchleitner and A. Krug [3–5]: in the high frequency regime ωf I 3 > 1 the
ionization threshold is determined by the same quantum localization mechanism as for excited Hydrogen atoms [35];
in the intermediate frequency regime ωf I 3
< 1 quantum localization again detemines the ionization threshold, but
the Alkali-metal atoms quantum defects raise the dimensionality of the problem [8]; ﬁnally, as we have shown in the
present paper, in the low frequency regime ωf I 3
1, classical dynamics, which for excited Hydrogen atoms essentially
determines the ionization threshold alredy for ωf I 3 < 1, determines the ionization threshold for excited Alkali-metal
atoms too, which, due to core eﬀects, is chaotic and much lower than the Hydrogen one.

Its ratio to the ﬁrst order term is therefore of the order of F I 4, which for the ﬁelds of interest F ∼< 1/(3I 5) is less than
1/(3I), giving a negligible contribution for I ≫ 1.

[29] We note that in this case we have F (t) = 0 and we therefore need not worry about it in the classical picture; as opposed

to the quantum picture outlined in section II where the non-adiabaticity at F (t) = 0 plays a fondamental role.

[30] Even in resonance approximation classical adiabaticity in that region is not possible, as the motion on the separatrix has

an inﬁnite period, due to the presence of unstable ﬁxed points.

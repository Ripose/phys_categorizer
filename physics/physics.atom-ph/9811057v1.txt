The Stark widths of the Ne VII 2s3s − 2s3p singlet and triplet lines are calculated in the impact
approximation using quantum-mechanical Convergent Close-Coupling and Coulomb-Born-Exchange
approximations. It is shown that the contribution from inelastic collisions to the line widths exceeds
the elastic width contribution by about an order of magnitude. Comparison with the line widths
measured in a hot dense plasma of a gas-liner pinch indicates a signiﬁcant diﬀerence which may be
naturally explained by non-thermal Doppler eﬀects from persistent implosion velocities or turbulence
developed during the pinch implosion. Contributions to the line width from diﬀerent partial waves
and types of interactions are discussed as well.

I. INTRODUCTION

Spectral line shapes can provide very rich and valuable information on important plasma parameters, such as
ion and atom temperature, electron density, electric ﬁeld distributions, etc. The quantum-mechanical theory of
collisional impact line broadening is well established and developed [1], however, the number of purely quantum
calculations, especially for highly charged ions, is rather limited. Most theoretical eﬀorts were directed toward
elaboration of semiclassical or semiempirical methods which showed good accuracy for neutrals and low-charge ions.
It is only recently, when a number of sophisticated atomic collisional codes have become available, that high-quality
quantum-mechanical results could be applied to line shape calculations for highly charged ions. From the experimental
point of view, test measurements of line proﬁles are impeded by the required independent determination of plasma
temperature and density. The experimental situation is even more peculiar in that the line widths of high-Z ions were
measured almost exclusively by the Bochum group (see [2,3] and references therein), and therefore lack an independent
conﬁrmation.

The recent results on the Stark broadening of spectral lines from multiply charged ions revealed a signiﬁcant discrep-
ancy between the independent quantum-mechanical calculations and, on the other hand, experimental measurements
and semiclassical results. For the B III measurements [4,5], the Stark line widths for the simplest 2s
2p transition
diﬀer by as much as a factor of 2, the two quantum results [6,7] being in agreement to within 10%. A possible
explanation for this discrepancy in terms of a developed turbulence and diﬀerent treatments of small partial waves in
electron-ion scattering was proposed in Ref. [6]; however, more comparisons and detailed investigation of important
contributions to the line width are of primary importance.

scattering amplitudes for the target ion in the upper and lower states, respectively, and the integral is performed
over the scattering angle θ, with dΩ being the element of solid angle. Equation (1) relates a line width in the
impact approximation with atomic cross sections, facilitating the use of well-developed techniques of atomic scattering
calculations for line broadening studies. It can also be rewritten in terms of the elastic S-matrix elements assuming

are 6-j symbols. The advantage of Eq. (1) is that it gives more clear insight as to the importance of

(cid:26)
inelastic and elastic contributions to the line width; therefore, we will mainly be referring to Eq. (1) in what follows.
In the present work, the inelastic cross sections appearing in Eq. (1) were calculated with two independent methods,
i.e., the Convergent Close-Coupling (CCC) and Coulomb-Born-Exchange (CBE) approximations. The basic idea of
the CCC method [14] lies in the close-coupling expansion with a large number of square-integrable states. A set of
coupled Lippmann-Schwinger equations for the transition matrix is solved in momentum space, and the convergence
of the results may be checked easily by increasing the number of the basis functions. The details of the CCC method
can be found in a number of recent reviews [15,16], where a very good agreement with various experimental collisional
data is shown. For the calculations with the more traditional CBE approximation we made use of the code ATOM
In addition to the Coulomb attraction between ion and electron and exchange, ATOM

accounts for normalization (unitarization) eﬀects and uses experimental level energies when calculating the atomic
wave functions and collisional cross sections. It is well known that the Coulomb-Born approximation corresponds to
perturbation theory with 1/Z as expansion parameter, where Z is the spectroscopic charge; therefore, one can expect
better accuracy for the CBE method applied to highly charged ions. Although the CCC method generally provides
a superior accuracy, the use of ATOM greatly reduces the computational eﬀorts. Comparison of CCC and CBE
cross sections for highly charged H- and Li-like ions (Z . 12) demonstrated an excellent agreement between these two
methods and available experimental data [18].

B. Atomic Structure

Before proceeding to the details of collisional calculations, it is worth mentioning some features of the Ne VII atomic
structure. First, the current version of the CCC code utilizes the Hartree-Fock (HF) frozen-core approximation for
atomic wave functions. To study the validity of this approach, we have made a comparison of wave functions calculated
with the full HF and HF frozen-core methods using the Cowan code [19]. The agreement between the two sets of wave
functions proved to be very good, thereby justifying the use of the frozen-core approximation. These calculations were
also used to determine the root mean squared radii of the lower 2s3s and upper 2s3p states, which were found to be
10−8 cm is the Bohr radius. (Recall that the CBE ATOM code
1.81a0 and 1.79a0 respectively, where a0 = 0.529
constructs atomic wave functions by solving the Schr¨odinger equation with experimental energies rather than solving
ab initio HF equations.) Another measure indicating the level of accuracy are the oscillator strengths, which for the
CCC calculations are found to agree within one percent with the Opacity Project results [20]. Since in some cases the
ATOM oscillator strengths fAT OM deviate from the high-accuracy results facc by as much as 15%, the CBE dipole-
allowed excitation cross sections were rescaled by the ratio facc/fAT OM to improve these results. Finally, to check the
applicability of LS coupling, we carried out large scale atomic structure calculations for Ne VII with Cowan’s code
taking into account both intermediate coupling and conﬁguration interaction. The results obtained show that the
levels of interest of Ne VII correspond to practically pure LS coupling, although conﬁguration interaction is important
for the 2s3p 1P and 2p3s 1P states which mix to a level of 10%. Nonetheless, this mixture is unlikely to be important,
since in the sum of inelastic cross sections in Eq. (1) this eﬀect is essentially smoothed out.

·

C. Inelastic collisions

The inelastic cross sections appearing in Eq. (1) include all possible electron-induced transitions originating from
the lower or upper states of a transition. It is normally safe to neglect the ionization and recombination processes,
taking into account only electron impact excitation and deexcitation. For the line widths discussed here, even the
∆n
= 0 excitations may (but will not) be ignored, since their rates are at least two orders of magnitude smaller
than those for the ∆n = 0 transitions. Table I presents the CBE rate coeﬃcients for electron impact excitation and
de-excitation processes connecting the upper and lower levels of transitions with other perturbing 2l3l′ levels. The
calculation was carried out for an electron temperature Te = 20 eV, which corresponds to the experimental conditions
of Ref. [8], and only one-electron transitions are considered here since two-electron transitions were found to have
much smaller cross sections. One can see that the largest rate coeﬃcients correspond to dipole-allowed transitions,
while dipole-forbidden and spin-forbidden channels contribute only a few percent to the inelastic part of the line
width. It should also be noted that since the reaction thresholds are smaller than 6-7 eV, the rate coeﬃcients are
rather insensitive to small (a few eV) variations in the electron temperature around the experimental value of 20 eV.
Both calculational methods give close (within 10%) results for the most important dipole-allowed cross sections.
(Note that the excitation of the inner 2l electron is also signiﬁcant for the line width, contributing as much as 12%
and 8% for singlet and triplet lines, respectively.) An example of the agreement between the CCC and CBE results
is demonstrated on Fig. 1, where 2s3s 1S - 2s3p 1P and 2s3p 3P - 2s3d 3D excitation cross sections are shown.

method. The comparison shows very good agreement between our data and those of Ref. [21]. For instance, the

with the R-matrix values of 6.2
for excitation rates from the ground and metastable states to some of the n = 3 states at an electron temperature
of 260 eV; these are 2 to 3 times smaller than CCC/CBE rates, but large experimental errors up to 200-300% limit

D. Elastic Collisions

According to Eq. (1), the non-Coulomb elastic amplitudes of scattering from the upper and lower states at the same
electron impact energy should be subtracted and averaged over the Maxwellian electron energy distribution. These
amplitudes were calculated for a large range of electron energies only with the CCC code, since the existing version of
the CBE code ATOM produces only inelastic cross sections. The 2s3s 3S and 2s3p 3P elastic cross sections σel(E)

sections and diﬀerence term having a similar behavior. These results unambiguously reveal the same peculiarities as
were noticed for the B III 2s
2p elastic term [6], i.e., a faster than 1/E energy dependence and strong cancellation
in ˜σ(E). For example, at electron impact energies E & 30 eV, the coherent diﬀerence ˜σ is more than an order of
magnitude smaller than any of the σel. Since at large energies the elastic cross section is mainly determined by the
size of a system, such a cancellation may be due to almost equal mean squared radii of the 2s3s and 2s3p states, as
was already mentioned above. The general behavior of the elastic diﬀerence term deserves a special investigation and
will be reported elsewhere. The Maxwell-averaged elastic contribution to the line width is wS
el ≈
0.023 ˚A for singlet and triplet, respectively. This shows that in this case the elastic contribution to the line widths is
about an order of magnitude smaller than the inelastic one, which is not surprising for such high temperatures.

III. DISCUSSION

The line widths calculated here diﬀer noticeably from the measured values of Ref. [8] and most of the theoretical
data. The ratios of experimental to diﬀerent theoretical Stark widths for the Ne VII lines are presented in Table II. The
methods cited there cover various modiﬁcations of the semiclassical [1,9] and semiempirical [10,11] approximations.
The semiclassical methods, including the latest nonperturbative calculations [9], yield values which are generally in
agreement with the experimental data. The semiempirical results of Dimitrijevi´c and Konjevi´c [11] are rather close
to our values, and this is quite similar to what had already been noticed for the B III calculations [6].

The major diagnostics challenge in the gas-liner pinch experiment [8] may be the determination of the main plasma
parameters, i.e., the electron temperature and density, in a region where the multiply charged ions of neon are
situated. In the experiment both Te and Ne were determined from the Thomson scattering only globally which may
not be characteristic of the plasma conditions near the locally injected neon. As a matter of fact, there exist some
experimental indications that density and temperature do vary in the vicinity of the doping gas [23]. However, the
20 eV are well within the
experimental value of Te is supported by the fact that electron temperatures Te = 19
range of the maximal abundance temperatures for Ne VII at an electron density Ne = (3
1018 cm−3. Our
calculations with the collisional-radiative code NOMAD [24] show that for equilibrium conditions the Ne VII ions
account for about 30% of the total amount of neon. Another line broadening mechanism aﬀecting the observed widths
may be unresolved Doppler line splitting associated with the radial implosion velocities in the gas-liner pinch [23].
The contribution from an ion (proton) collisional broadening may be estimated using Eq. (517) from Ref. [1], and it
is easy to show that ion broadening is negligibly small comparing to electron impact broadening.

Since the experimental conditions in the Ne VII measurements were basically the same as for the B III experiment,
the general conclusions [6] regarding a possible eﬀect of a developed turbulence on the line widths should remain
essentially the same. It was mentioned in Ref. [8] that the measured value of Stark width for the triplet transition

0.45 ˚A constitutes about 70% of the total measured line width1 which therefore is ∆λexp

0.64 ˚A. This full
∆λ
width includes Stark, Doppler and instrumental broadening, the latter being decomposed into Gaussian (0.07 ˚A) and
Lorentzian (0.05 ˚A) parts [2]. For an ion temperature of Ti = Te = 20 eV, the pure Doppler width is approximately
0.15 ˚A. As noted in [6], the Reynolds numbers for the Bochum gas-liner pinch experiment are of the order of
∆λD ≈
104, which is suﬃcient for a developed turbulence to exist. Such a turbulence leads to an extra chaotic motion of Ne
ions with a characteristic velocity of the order of the proton thermal velocity vp. Hence, the full thermal+turbulent
Doppler width becomes a factor √20 + 1
0.70
˚A. Using Eq. (6) of Ref. [25], for the FWHM of a combined Voigt proﬁle including Stark, thermal+turbulent Doppler
0.85 ˚A which is 30% higher than ∆λexp. The main uncertainty
and instrumental contributions, we get a value ∆λ
in this calculation obviously comes from the turbulent contribution, which is rather sensitive to the value of the
characteristic velocity. It is straightforward to show that reducing this velocity by one third only, i.e., multiplying the
pure Doppler width by 3.1 instead of 4.6, one can exactly reproduce the experimental value of ∆λexp. Thus, according
to the hypothesis proposed in Ref. [6], reasonable values of characteristic turbulent velocities may naturally explain
the observed diﬀerence in line widths.

Regarding the discrepancy between the quantum and other theoretical calculations, the reader may wonder as to
the source of such a diﬀerence. The crucial point is that unlike the quantum-mechanical methods, the semiclassical
approaches have a natural limit of applicability arising from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (see, e.g., [26]). The
criterion of applicability of the semiclassical calculations may be formulated [27] as a requirement for the distance
of the closest approach rmin, rather than the impact parameter ρ, to be larger or at least of the same order than
the corresponding de Broglie wavelength, λmin = 2π~/mvmax. Using the angular momentum conservation it is
straightforward to show that this is equivalent to the inequality:

Another limitation on impact parameters was introduced in order to avoid violations of unitarity [1], but still assuming
the long-range dipole interaction to remain valid. Again reformulated in terms of the distance of the closest approach
the corresponding condition may be written as

where rn is the excited state atomic radius. If this inequality is violated, both semiclassical and long-range interaction

As was noted above, the mean root squared radii of the 2s3s and 2s3p states are about 1.8a0. For Te = 20 eV,
the Coulomb parameter is η
7 and therefore the ratio rn/rmin takes values of 1.45, 0.96, 0.43 and 0.22 for L =
4, 5, 8 and 12 respectively. It follows then that for the given electron temperature, criteria (4) and (5) are similarly
restrictive for the semiclassical approximation.

≃

Unlike to the semiclassical method, in fully quantum-mechanical calculations the determination of the range of
signiﬁcant L-values is naturally accomplished by the partial wave expansion. In Fig. 3 the contribution of diﬀerent
total electron+ion angular momenta LT to the CCC cross sections is shown for an incident electron impact energy
of 20 eV for a number of transitions2. Naturally, the elastic cross sections are governed by the smallest values of
LT , which are concealed in the strong collision term of semiclassical calculations. The most important inelastic cross
sections having the smallest thresholds reach 50% of their values only for L = 9 for which the l.h.s. ratio of Eq.
(5) is about 0.35. This number is probably already suﬃciently small to justify the use of the long-range interaction
approximation for L

9; however, the restrictions following from Eq. (4) are less obvious to have been overcome.

Another discrepancy may come from other than dipole interactions. Although the monopole interaction was not
explicitly included into nonperturbative semiclassical calculations [9], the quadrupole transition 2s3s
2s3d was shown
to account for about 15% of the line width. This value is in contradiction to the present results. As one can see from

2s3d quadrupole channel contributes only approximately 3% to the quantum-mechanical inelastic
line width. If we take into account only those transitions that were considered in Ref. [9], then this number increases
to 3.5%, still a factor of 4 smaller than the nonperturbative semiclassical result.

−

These considerations clearly show that the accuracy of the semiclassical calculations may not be as high as it is
often thought to be, and new calculations, both semiclassical and quantum-mechanical, are needed to better establish
the limits of applicability for the non-quantum methods.

IV. CONCLUSION

A fully quantum-mechanical calculation of the Stark line widths for the singlet and triplet 2s3s

2s3p lines of
Ne VII was carried out in the impact approximation with the use of accurate atomic data. Although the results
obtained disagree with experimental and most theoretical results, a natural explanation for this disagreement can
be suggested. On one hand, the measurements are not free from diﬃculties related to possible extra contributions
from turbulence and unresolved Doppler shifts. This suggests an independent measurement of Stark widths of highly
charged ions. On the other hand, the semiclassical calculations, not obviously producing accurate results for other
than dipole interactions, may have problems when being applied to the small impact parameter region. In our opinion,
the next important step in the development of Stark broadening theory would be a very detailed comparison between
quantum and semiclassical results.

Dynamic stabilization of atomic hydrogen against ionization in high-frequency single- and two-
color, circularly polarized laser pulses is observed by numerically solving the three-dimensional,
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. The single-color case is revisited and numerically determined
ionization rates are compared with both, exact and approximate high-frequency Floquet rates. The
position of the peaks in the photoelectron spectra can be explained with the help of dressed initial
states. In two-color laser ﬁelds of opposite circular polarization the stabilized probability density
may be shaped in various ways. For laser frequencies ω1 and ω2 = nω1, n = 2, 3, . . . and suﬃciently
large excursion amplitudes n + 1 distinct probability density peaks are observed. This may be
viewed as the generalization of the well-known “dichotomy” in linearly polarized laser ﬁelds, i.e,
as “trichotomy,” “quatrochotomy,” “pentachotomy” etc. All those observed structures and their
“hula-hoop”-like dynamics can be understood with the help of high-frequency Floquet theory and
the two-color Kramers-Henneberger transformation. The shaping of the probability density in the
stabilization regime can be realized without additional loss in the survival probability, as compared
to the corresponding single-color results.

INTRODUCTION

For suﬃciently high laser frequency and intensity, the
ionization probability of an atom decreases by further in-
creasing the laser intensity. This, at ﬁrst sight, counterin-
tuitive eﬀect is called dynamic or adiabatic stabilization,
depending on the pulse length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
So far, it has been observed in numerical simulations
only (see [9] and, for very recent results, [10, 11]).
Its
theoretical explanation is most elucidating in the frame-
work of high-frequency Floquet theory [4]:
the time-
averaged Kramers-Henneberger potential, as it is seen by
a free electron moving in the laser ﬁeld, provides bound
states. The electronic probability density of these states
is spread over spatial regions with dimensions of the order
of the classical excursion amplitude which may be tens
of atomic units or more. The laser frequency ω, required
for dynamic stabilization where the electron starts from
E0, has to

exceed the ﬁeld-dressed binding energy, ~ω >
. Since

such high frequencies are not yet accessible to nowadays
intense laser systems the experimental veriﬁcation of dy-
namic stabilization is still to come. However, with the
intense, short-wavelength, and coherent light sources un-

ground state stabilization should become experimentally
accessible soon. Signatures of dynamic stabilization of

Dynamic stabilization has been studied extensively
during the last decade.
Ionization rates and energy
shifts were obtained numerically by Floquet theory [13]
or approximate, analytical high-frequency Floquet the-
ory [2, 4]. Full numerical ab initio solutions of the time-
dependent, single-electron Schr¨odinger equation were ob-
tained for low-dimensional model systems (see, e.g.,
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]) and, after the early work in [9]
very recently, in three spatial dimensions for linear po-
larization [10] and circularly polarized laser pulses [11].
Although the Floquet ionization rates decrease monoton-
the ionization probability
ically for laser intensity I
→ ∞
in full ab initio solutions of the TDSE for ﬁnite laser
pulses assumes a minimum and increases again there-
after. In the limit of laser intensity I
but other-
wise ﬁxed pulse parameters the survival probability of
an atom will thus approach zero. Moreover, it has been
found that the magnetic ﬁeld of the laser—usually ne-
glected because of the dipole approximation—leads to in-
creased ionization [20]. This is due to the ponderomotive
force which pushes the electrons in propagation direction.
In multi-electron atoms electron correlation also hinders
stabilization (see [21], and references therein). Two-color
interference eﬀects on stabilization in linear polarization
was studied in [22, 23].

In this paper the dynamic stabilization of H in cir-
cularly polarized single- and two-color ﬁelds is investi-
gated. The article is organized as follows: in Sec. II the
three-dimensional, time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
to be solved numerically is introduced, and the form of

2

the applied two-color ﬁelds is explained. In Sec. III the
results concerning the single-color, circular polarization
case are presented. Besides snapshots of the probabil-
ity density and photoelectron spectra, particular empha-
sis is put on the comparison of ionization rates and en-
ergy shifts with results from Floquet theory. In Sec. IV
the main two-color results are presented. Probability
density structures are observed which display well sep-
arated maxima, the number of which is related to the
frequency ratio of the two ﬁelds. The structure moves as
a whole in the laser ﬁeld and can be explained with the
help of two-color, time-averaged Kramers-Henneberger
potentials.
Survival probabilities after the two-color
pulses are presented as a function of the two laser’s peak
ﬁeld strengths. The two-color survival probabilities and
above-threshold ionization spectra are compared with the
corresponding single-color results where the second ﬁeld
was absent. It is good news that adding a second color is
possible without a drastic inhibition of stabilization even
if the second laser’s intensity lies in the “death valley” of
high ionization. Finally, we conclude in Sec. V.

is solved numerically in three spatial dimensions (atomic
units are used unless noted otherwise). The intense laser
ﬁeld can be treated classically. Since the laser wave-
length is large compared to all other relevant length
scales and the electron dynamics is non-relativistic for
our laser parameters, the dipole approximation can be
applied so that the vector potential A(t) does not de-
pend on spatial coordinates. Hence, the magnetic com-
ponent of the laser ﬁeld is neglected. If we restrict our-
selves to study coplanar two-color ﬁelds (of, however, ar-
bitrary ellipticity) we may choose the coordinate system
in such a way that the z-component of the electric ﬁeld

In the actual implementation, the radial coordinate r
was discretized directly in position space. The details of
the implementation may be found in [24] and is similar

to what has been described in [25] for the simpler case of
linear polarization.

The radius of our numerical grid, including the region
where the non-vanishing imaginary potential damps away
probability density approaching the grid boundary, was
between 240 a.u. and 450 a.u. The maximum ℓ quantum
number was typically ℓmax = 30. For testing the con-
vergence of our results runs up to ℓmax = 50 were also
performed—with no signiﬁcant changes in the observ-
ables of interest. For obtaining the results presented in
this paper, the run times of our Schr¨odinger-solver were
always less than 18 hours on 1 GHz PCs.

We focus on two-color ﬁelds where both ﬁelds are circu-
larly polarized. We assume a sin2-shaped up- and down-
ramp of the ith ﬁeld, i = 1, 2 over N (i)
23 cycles and
a constant part of N (i)
12 cycles duration. In the following
we will refer to such a pulse as a (N (i)

III. THE CIRCULAR SINGLE-COLOR CASE
REVISITED

Before turning to the two-color study let us analyze the
simpler single-color case. For the latter, results from ab
initio solutions of the three-dimensional TDSE were ob-
tained only recently [10] whereas two-dimensional model
solutions were presented earlier [16, 17, 18, 19]. Ioniza-
tion rates as well as energy shifts for hydrogen in the sta-
bilization regime (with dipole approximation) are avail-
able for several years [13] so that a comparison with our
ﬁnite pulse results is possible and will be presented in this
paper. Since all vector potential amplitudes ˆA considered
in this work are
10 a.u. the dipole approximation is ap-
≤
plicable, as has been shown in [20].

FIG. 1: The probability density, integrated over a sphere of
radius Rb = 60 for laser pulses of frequency ω = 1 [plot (a)]
and ω = 2 [plot (b)] vs. time. (4,16,4)- and (4,32,4)-pulses
were chosen for ω = 1 and ω = 2, respectively. The ˆE values
are attached to the curves. The survival probability increases
with increasing peak ﬁeld strengths, but not beyond a certain
maximum.
In some of the cases an ionization rate can be
determined from the (in the logarithmic plot) linear slope.

A. Survival probability vs. time

In order to calculate the probability for the hydrogen
atom to “survive” non-ionized till the end of the pulse
the probability density is integrated over a spherical vol-
ume of radius Rb = 60 atomic units. The radius Rb was
chosen several times greater than the biggest excursion
amplitude ˆα = 10 a.u. considered in this paper. Since the
free part of the wavefunction vanishes inside that sphere
at suﬃciently large times after the laser pulse has passed
by, the amount of probability density inside the sphere
leads then with high accuracy to the same probability one
would obtain by projecting on all bound states. The re-
sults are presented in Fig. 1. In the upper panel (a) the
results for ω = 1 are presented, in the lower panel (b)
those for ω = 2. All pulses were up- and down-ramped
over 4 cycles. The constant part of the pulse lasted 16 cy-
cles for ω = 1 and 32 cycles for ω = 2. By Fig. 1 the very
existence of dynamic stabilization is proven: the survival
probability at the end of the pulse increases with increas-
ing peak ﬁeld strength (attached to the curves) up to a
maximum value. Increasing the peak ﬁeld strength fur-
ther yields a decreasing survival probability (not shown
in Fig. 1). The highest survival probability in plot (b)

4

≈

amounts to
47%. It should be noted, however, that the
survival probability is rather sensitive to the laser pulse
shape and duration. This was also found in the case of
linear polarization and is discussed at length in Ref. [10].
Whenever the slope of the probability curves vs. time
is linear on the logarithmic scale an ionization rate can be
determined. While this is straightforward for the curves
in the ω = 2 panel it turns out to be more diﬃcult for the
ω = 1-results in (a). Longer pulses of constant intensity
are then needed to obtain unambiguous rates.

B. Snapshots of the probability density

For suﬃciently large excursions ˆα and adiabatic turn-
ons one expects the system to occupy essentially the
ground state in the time-averaged Kramers-Henneberger
(KH) potential. This corresponds to lowest-order high-
frequency Floquet theory [4]. The KH potential is the
ionic potential a free electron, just oscillating in the laser
ﬁeld, would “see”, i.e., VKH(r) = V (r + α(t)) where α(t)
is the trajectory of a free electron in the ﬁeld

the probability density is linear. The overlayed black circle
of radius ˆα = 10 indicates the corresponding free electron
trajectory. A clockwise “hula-hoop”-like [11] dynamics of the
probability density ring is observed.

In the case of a single-color, circularly polarized laser
the KH potential, averaged over one laser cycle, has az-
imuthal symmetry with respect to the laser propagation
direction (the z-axis in our case) and, for suﬃciently big
ˆα, its minimum along a circle of approximate radius ˆα
in a plane perpendicular to it (the xy-plane in our case).
Consequently, the KH ground state probability density
has its maximum along that circle. By transforming back
to the lab frame, where the ionic potential is assumed
centered at the origin, this ring-shaped, stabilized proba-
bility density orbits with its center along the free electron
trajectory which itself is a circle of radius ˆα. What re-
sults is a “hula-hoop”-like dynamics [11] of a probability
density ring about the ion which assumes the role of the
“hula-hoop”-dancer’s hip.

In Fig. 2 we present snaphots of the probability den-
sity in the xy-plane at z = 0 during the 9th laser cycle
of the (2,8,2)-pulse with ω = 1. The peak ﬁeld strength
was ˆE = 10, yielding an excursion radius ˆα = 10. Al-
though a probability density ring, describing the previ-
ously explained “hula-hoop”-dynamics, is clearly visible,
the probability density is not uniformly distributed along
that ring but has rather a sickle-like shape. Hence, the
system is obviously not in the KH ground state but in a
superposition of states with diﬀerent azimuthal quantum
numbers. This leads to Rabi ﬂoppings on time scales that
are large compared to the laser period. Note that there is
always a probability density maximum at the position of
the ion. For lower values of ˆα we observed more complex
situations where no clear ring structure but two or more
wave packets swirl about the ion.

For the single-color case, accurate ionization rates were
numerically obtained many years ago by means of non-
perturbative Floquet theory [13]. Those rates are accu-
rate in the sense that if the system somehow manages to
occupy a single Floquet state it will decay precisely with
the corresponding Floquet rate. Usually an adiabatic
turn-on is needed to transfer the system from the ﬁeld-
free groundstate to a single Floquet state. The problem
is that an adiabatic ramping of the laser pulse counter-
acts stabilization because the system has to spend too
much time in the so-called “death valley” of medium
laser intensities where ionization is strong, and thus noth-
ing would survive to be stabilized. Hence, short turn-on
times are desirable. However, after such rapid turn-ons
the system might be “shaken-up” into a superposition of
many Floquet states. Under such conditions only the full
solution of the TDSE yields reliable ionization probabil-
ities and, if existing, ionization rates.

In Fig. 3 our ionization rates for ω = 1 and ω = 2 (de-
termined from plots like those in Fig. 1) are compared
with Floquet results [13] and the analytical results de-
rived by Pont and Gavrila [2, 4]. The Pont-Gavrila rate

Gavrila rate overestimates ionization. Our numerical
rates were obtained from simulations of (4,16,4)-pulses
for ω = 1 and (4,32,4)-pulses for ω = 2. The results
for the highest ˆα values shown were diﬃcult to deter-
mine because the ionization probability curves vs. time
displayed no clear exponential decrease. In order to de-
termine unambiguous ionization rates also for higher ˆα
a more adiabatic up-ramp of the laser ﬁeld and a longer
pulse duration would be required. However, since it is
not the goal of this paper to determine rates which are

In Fig. 4 photoelectron spectra after (4,8,4)-pulses (for
ω = 1) and (8,16,8)-pulses (for ω = 2) of diﬀerent peak
ﬁeld strength are presented. They were calculated from
the wave function immediately after the pulse with the
window-operator method proposed in [26]. The three
lowest-order ATI peaks n = 1, 2, 3, separated by ~ω,
are clearly visible although they broaden with increas-
ing laser intensity. From lowest order perturbation the-
ory (LOPT) an exponential decrease of the peak heights
ˆE2n with increasing n is expected. Within high-
∼
frequency Floquet theory, for ˆα
1 the
contributions of higher orders n do not vanish exponen-
n−2 [2]. By virtue of the ﬁrst two peaks
tially but only
in the highest- ˆE spectra of Fig. 4 this trend of increasing
importance of higher order peaks is conﬁrmed [note that
in the numerically obtained wavefunction after the pulse
the ATI peak n = 3 might be slightly suppressed because
of the absorbing boundaries]. With increasing population
of excited states the left shoulder of the ATI peaks be-
comes more pronounced. For certain laser intensities a
substructure of smaller peaks appears. Since these peaks
are separated by the energy diﬀerence of n = 2 and n = 3-
states, that is ∆
0.07, this substruc-
ture is likely connected to the population of these states.
However, we did not perform yet a detailed study of this
substructure. Here we want to focus on the ATI peak
positions. As can be easily inferred from Fig. 4 the ATI
peaks move with increasing laser intensity to higher pho-

case of long wavelengths the up-shift of the continuum

the substructure in the ATI spectrum (cf. Fig. 4) also
alters the absolute maximum of an ATI peak so that its

A. Time-averaged KH potentials

It is useful for the analysis of our two-color results to
get familiar with the free electron trajectories in such
ﬁelds and the corresponding time-averaged KH poten-
tials. In the two-color case the KH potentials were aver-
aged over the low-frequency laser period 2π/ω1. Let us
consider the two laser frequencies ω1 = 1 and ω2 = 2. If
the second ﬁeld is absent the free electron trajectory α(t)
describes a circle in the xy-plane of radius ˆα0 = ˆE(1)/ω2
1.
If the second ﬁeld amplitude ˆE(2) equals ˆE(1), i.e., both
laser ﬁelds have the same intensity, the trajectory re-
sembles an equilateral triangle with rounded edges, and
max
= 5 ˆα0/4. If, instead, the vector potential am-
plitudes of both ﬁelds are equal, ˆE(1)/ω1 = ˆE(2)/ω2 =,
the electron follows a convex triangle with sharp edges,
= 3 ˆα0/2. Finally, equal excursion ampli-

and max

tudes, i.e., ˆE(1)/ω2

2, yields a rosette-like tra-
jectory, and max
= 2 ˆα0. The time-averaged KH po-
ˆα
|
|
tentials look accordingly. They are presented in Fig. 6.
In the two-color cases (b)–(d) the three-fold symmetry
leads to three potential minima near the turning points.
If the stabilized electron occupies the KH ground state
the probability density will show “trichotomy” instead
of the well-known “dichotomy” in the case of a single-
color linearly polarized laser where two probability peaks,
separated by 2 ˆα were observed [9].
In general, when
ω2 = nω1 the trajectories display (n + 1)-fold symme-
try. Provided the peak ﬁeld strengths are properly cho-

FIG. 6: Time-averaged KH potentials in the xy-plane at
z = 0 for ω1 = 1, ω2 = 2. The peak ﬁeld strengths ˆE(1), ˆE(2)
are chosen in such a way that (a) the ω2-ﬁeld is absent, ˆE(1) =
6; (b) the two laser intensities are equal, ˆE(1) = ˆE(2) = 6;
(c) the two vector potential amplitudes are equal, ˆE(1)/ω1 =
ˆE(2)/ω2 = 6; (d) the two excursion amplitudes are equal,
ˆE(1)/ω2
2 = 4. In the two-color cases (b)–(d) the
three-fold symmetry leads to three minima in the potential.
The corresponding KH ground state probability densities will
therefore display “trichotomy,” i.e., three spatially separated
maxima of the probability density.

1 = ˆE(2)/ω2

sen, for n = 3, 4, . . . the n + 1 minima of the time-
averaged KH potentials will lead to “quatrochotomy,”
“pentachotomy,” etc. The electron dynamics in the lab
frame should then resemble “hula-hoop” with a triangle,
a square, a pentagon, and so forth. We would like to
remark that the discrete symmetry of the trajectory and
the time-averaged KH potential is closely related to selec-
tion rules for harmonic generation in two-color ﬁelds (see
[27], and references therein). If the two ﬁelds with fre-
quencies ω1 and ω2 = nω1 are equally polarized instead of
oppositely, the KH potentials have (n
1)-fold symmetry.
Hence, to obtain “trichotomy” ω2 = 4ω1 has to be chosen
in this case. If the two frequencies are not commensu-
rable the free electron trajectories are not closed, and the
two-color, time-average KH potential is ill-deﬁned. How-
ever, we observed stabilization also in this case although
no distinct probability density peaks were obtained.

B. Snapshots of the probability density

In Fig. 7 snapshots of the trichotomous “hula-hoop”-
dynamics for ω1 = 1, ω2 = 2 during one laser cycle (with
respect to the ω1 = 1-ﬁeld) is presented. The two laser
intensities were chosen equal so that the free-electron tra-
jectory is a triangle with rounded edges. This triangle
is drawn in black in each of the plots of Fig. 7. As ex-
pected, the center of the trichotomous probability density
(aligned along the time-averaged KH potential) moves

the xy-plane at z = 0 during the 9th (low frequency) cycle

pulse], and ˆE1 = ˆE2 = 10 “Trichotomy” and “hula-hoop”-

probability density maximum.

In Fig. 8 three other examples for stabilized probability
density are presented. In panel (a), where the excursion
amplitudes for both ﬁelds were chosen equal, no three
distinct peaks are visible because ˆα = 5 is too small.
In (b) a clear example of equal intensity quatrochotomy
(i.e., ω2 = 3) is shown and in (c) a case of pentachotomy
(ω2 = 4) where both ﬁelds had equal vector potential
amplitudes. The density of the n + 1 peaks varies during
the course of the laser pulse. This implies that several
Floquet states are involved.

the ω2 = 2-ﬁeld alone yields optimal stabilization, and a
ω1 = 1-ﬁeld with ˆE(1) in the “death valley” is added—
what is the survival probability? In the worst case ion-
ization would be dominated by the “death valley”-ﬁeld,
making the two-color stabilization not very attractive.
Fortunately, it is not the ﬁeld which would lead to high-
est ionization, if applied alone, that dominates two-color
dynamic stabilization. In Fig. 9 the temporal evolution of
the survival probability in the two-color case is compared
with the two corresponding single-color results. From

In our

the ﬁeld strength regime where
ˆE(1)/ω1, ˆE(2)/ω2 < 1 in Fig. 10 may be identiﬁed as
the “death valley” of high ionization probability. Of
course, the survival probability increases towards unity
as ˆE(1), ˆE(2)
0. However, this has been suppressed in
the plot because it blocked the visibility of the results
in the stabilization regime in which we are interested.
Given a certain ˆE(1), adding ˆE(2) is, from a stabilization
point of view, almost always beneﬁcial, provided that
ˆE(2) is not too strong so that shake-oﬀ dominates.
If,
on the other hand, we choose a certain ˆE(2) and add
a ω1-ﬁeld the survival probability may be enhanced or
diminished, depending on whether ˆE(2) lies in its single-
color stabilization regime or near its single-color “death
valley.” The case of a rosette-like stabilized probability
density where the excursion amplitudes ˆα are equal leads

sities are tuned to yield equal excursion amplitudes ˆα
the two-color survival probability is closer to the single-
color high-frequency result with relatively low ionization
probability. The low-frequency ﬁeld alone has a higher
ionization probability. In the equal intensity plot (b) it is
the other way round: the two-color result follows closely
the low-frequency curve whereas the high-frequency ﬁeld
alone yields higher ionization because ˆE(2) is still close
to the “death valley.” Since in plot (a) all curves cross
each other it is apparent that the ﬁnal survival proba-
bility is sensitive to the pulse length. However, it should
be stressed that, fortunately, the two-color survival prob-
ability is not determined by the frequency which yields
highest ionization. This means that the two-color “prob-
ability density shaping,” as discussed in the previous sub-
section, can be performed without drastic reduction of
the survival probability.

In Fig. 10 the survival probabilities at the end of
(2,8,2)- and (4,16,4)-pulses for ω1 = 1 and ω2 = 2, re-
spectively, are plotted vs. the ﬁeld amplitudes ˆE(1) and
ˆE(2). Because of the probability density representing free
but slow electrons it takes a long time until the probabil-
ity density integrated over the sphere of radius Rb = 60
assumes a constant value. Hence, to obtain Fig. 10 we
have chosen to measure the survival probability as the
maximum probability to ﬁnd the electron in a smaller
sphere of radius Rs = 7.5 within a time period of 85 a.u.
after the pulse. The maximum probability has to be
taken because of oscillations due to excitation of the 2s
and the 3s state. Note that this method for measur-
ing the survival probability slightly overestimates ioniza-
tion because probability density which represents slow
recombining electrons, slowly spirals back to the ion and
does not enter the small sphere within the observation
time. However, here we are not interested in absolute
numbers (which depend sensitively on the pulse dura-
tion and shape anyway). From Fig. 10 one infers that
the highest survival probability is obtained, as expected,
in the single-color high-frequency case where ˆE(1) = 0.
In general, the overall behavior is an increasing stabi-

In contrast, the
equal intensity result remains close to the low-frequency
single-color result where ˆE(2) = 0. Note that maximum
stabilization is achieved for modest values of ˆα = ˆE/ω2
where the probability density splitting, i.e., trichotomy,
quatrochotomy, etc., is not yet developed.

D. ATI in circular two-color stabilization

Finally, let us brieﬂy discuss the two-color photoelec-
tron spectra. The single color case has been analyzed in
subsection III D.

In Fig. 11 the two-color spectra are compared with
the corresponding single-color results where either the
ω1 = 1-ﬁeld or the ω2 = 2-ﬁeld was present. The
laser intensities were chosen not deep in the stabiliza-
tion regime because at such high laser intensities the
clear ATI-structure gets corrupted by peak broadening
and modulations (cf. Fig. 4).

The ATI peaks in the two-color spectra are located at
higher energies than those of the corresponding single-
color results. This is due to the fact that the ground
state in the time-averaged KH potential experiences a
stronger up-shift as compared to the single-color KH po-
tentials. It would be interesting to analyze the ATI peak
positions in the two-color case in the same way as it was
done in Sec. III D for single-color ﬁelds. However, to our

As far as the peak strengths are concerned the two-
color spectrum is, of course, not simply the sum of the
two single-color spectra: the ﬁrst ATI peak in the single-
color ω2-spectrum is stronger than both, the second peak
of the two-color and the single-color ω1-ﬁeld. This is com-
patible with Fig. 10 from which one infers that adding to
the ω2-ﬁeld (whose intensity lies close to the “death val-
ley”) the lower frequency ω1-ﬁeld suppresses ionization.
In the equal- ˆA-result the two-color spectrum is close to

V. CONCLUSION

We have studied the dynamic stabilization of atomic
hydrogen against ionization in single- and two-color,
circularly polarized laser pulses by solving numerically
the three-dimensional, time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion.
In the single-color case we conﬁrmed the “hula-
hoop”-like dynamics for suﬃciently high excursions ˆα.
Ionization rates were compared with those from (high-
frequency) Floquet theory, and good agreement was
found. The positions of above-threshold ionization (ATI)
peaks in our numerical photoelectron spectra were ana-
lyzed. It was found that the ATI peaks move with in-

creasing laser intensity towards higher energies, in con-
trast to what happens in intense, low-frequency ﬁelds.
This behavior can be explained by the laser ﬁeld-induced
up-shift of the initially populated, ﬁeld-free ground state.
For two-color laser ﬁelds of opposite circular polariza-
tion we presented stabilized probability density struc-
tures. For laser frequencies ω1 and ω2 = nω1, n =
2, 3, . . . and suﬃciently large excursion amplitudes (n+1)
distinct probability density peaks were observed, in ac-
cordance to what one expects by virtue of the two-color,
time-averaged Kramers-Henneberger potentials. As the
generalization of the well-known “dichotomy” in linearly
polarized laser ﬁelds, we called this multiple probability
density peak-splitting “trichotomy,” “quatrochotomy,”
“pentachotomy” etc.

The survival probability after two-color pulses of fre-
quencies ω1 = 1 and ω2 = 2 was calculated as a function
of the two peak ﬁeld strengths. As expected, highest sta-

10

bilization is achieved with the high-frequency ﬁeld alone
for a certain, optimal laser intensity. However, adding
the second, low-frequency ﬁeld, even if its intensity falls
into the “death valley,” fortunately does not drastically
reduce stabilization, as one might expect from a naive
superposition point-of-view.

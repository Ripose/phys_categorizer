Noise properties of an idealized atomic magnetometer that utilizes spin squeezing induced by a
continuous quantum nondemolition measurement are considered. Such a magnetometer measures
spin precession of N atomic spins by detecting optical rotation of far-detuned light. Fundamental
noise sources include the quantum projection noise and the photon shot-noise. For measurement
times much shorter than the spin-relaxation time divided by √N , the optimal sensitivity of the
magnetometer scales as N −3/4, so an advantage over the usual sensitivity scaling as N −1/2 can be
achieved, as demonstrated in a recent experiment by J. M. Geremia et al. (quant-ph/0401107).
However, at longer measurement times, the optimized sensitivity scales as N −1/2, similarly to the
usual shot-noise limited magnetometers. If strongly squeezed probe light is used, the Heisenberg
uncertainty limit may, in principle, be reached for very short measurement times. However, if the
exceedingly stringent limit (the spin-relaxation time divided by N ) on the measurement time is
exceeded, the N −1/2 sensitivity is again restored.

A recent experiment [1] reported an atomic magne-
tometer with noise exceeding the shot-noise limit. The
main idea of this work is that by utilizing quantum
nondemolition measurement (QND) of atomic spins by
performing an optical-rotation measurement with oﬀ-
resonant light it is possible to achieve spin squeezing (see,
for example, Refs.
[2, 3] and references therein). The
purpose of this technique is to reduce the inﬂuence of
the quantum-mechanical spin-projection noise.

Here we analyze the sensitivity of an idealized magne-
tometer based on these ideas and determine the scaling
of the sensitivity with various key parameters of the sys-
tem (e.g., the number of atoms N and the measurement
time τ ). For concreteness, we consider a magnetome-
ter scheme (see Fig. 1) in which a circularly polarized
pump beam resonant with an atomic transition orients
N paramagnetic atoms along ˆx. When the pump beam
is turned oﬀ, the atomic spins precess around the direc-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld to be measured, assumed here
to be along ˆy. The spin precession is detected using op-
Γ0, where Γ0 is

tuning from optical resonance), linearly polarized probe
beam propagating along ˆz.

According to general principles of quantum mechan-
ics, a measurement perturbs the quantum state of the
system under observation. For example, a photon can be
absorbed from the probe light beam exciting the atom
up from the state one is attempting to measure. It is im-
portant to realize, however, that if one is not attempting
to extract the complete information about the system, it
is quite straightforward to set up a QND measurement

that will not alter the quantity one is trying to deter-
mine (see, for example, Ref. [5]). Speciﬁcally, in the case
considered here, the orientation of the atomic spins in
a given direction is measured via optical rotation of the
probe beam. The photon-absorption probability scales
with detuning as 1/∆2, while optical rotation due to the
imbalance of the number of atoms oriented along and op-
posite to the light-propagation direction scales as 1/∆.
Thus, an approximation of a QND measurement of ori-
entation is realized by simply tuning the light suﬃciently
far away from resonance. On the other hand, the residual
absorption turns out to be important in optimizing the
measurement as discussed below.

We assume that the pump beam prepares the N
paramagnetic atoms with all spins polarized in the ˆx-
direction. Without loss of generality, we can assume that
the magnetic ﬁeld to be detected is very small. The mea-
surement of the optical rotation is carried out over a very

short time τ (the meaning of “short” will be speciﬁed
more precisely below). In order to make our argument as
transparent as possible, and to simplify the mathemat-
ical expressions, in the following we neglect numerical
constants of order unity, and work in the system of units
where ¯h = c = 1.

First, we recall the principle of the magnetometer’s
operation. The polarized atoms undergo Larmor preces-
sion in the applied ﬁeld, so their polarization direction
tips from the initial ˆx-direction towards ˆz by an angle
gµBτ during the measurement time τ . Here g is the
Land´e factor and µ is the Bohr magneton. The angle of
optical rotation induced by the excess of atoms with spin
projection along ˆz can be written as

It is important to emphasize that the uncertainty in
magnetic-ﬁeld determination described by Eq. (6) arises
solely due to optical pumping induced by the probe beam
during the measurement time τ . As shown in Ref. [1], the
projection noise due to the initial spin preparation can
be eliminated by use of a proper measurement procedure.
In Eq. (4) we can write square of the light-ﬁeld am-
plitude in terms of the photon ﬂux as speciﬁed by the
Poynting vector:

ϕ = gµBτ

.

Here l is the length of the sample in the direction of
the light propagation, l0 is the on-resonance absorption
length, and the expression assumes far-detuned light and
a weak magnetic ﬁeld.

There are two fundamental sources of noise that limit
how well one can determine B from Eq. (1) (we assume
that the noise in the applied magnetic ﬁeld is negligible).
First, there is photon shot noise in the optical polarimeter

(δϕ)ph =

1
√ΦAτ

,

where Φ is the photon ﬂux and A is the cross-sectional
area of the laser beam (assumed to coincide with the
dimensions of the atomic sample). This noise translates
into the magnetic-ﬁeld detection limit [see Eq. (1)]

δBph =

The other source of noise is related to the fact that,
even though the probe light is far detuned from reso-
nance, it still excites some atoms during the time τ :

where d is the dipole moment of the probe transition
and E is the amplitude of the probe-light ﬁeld. The
ﬁrst factor is the resonant excitation rate, and the second
one reﬂects the fact that light is far detuned from the
resonance; the product of these two factors is the rate
of light-induced relaxation. Such excitation results in a
random excess of √Ne atoms polarized along ˆz or
ˆz.
This leads to optical rotation by a random angle

thought of as a mean free path for a resonant photon)
in Eq. (2) can be written

where n is the number density of the atoms.

Using the expressions (4), (7), and (8) in (6) and (9)
in (3), we see that the two contributions to uncertainty
in the magnetic-ﬁeld determination—one associated with
the polarimeter photon noise, the other associated with
reorientation of atoms by the probe light—have opposite
dependences on Φ. We can ﬁnd the optimum probe beam
ﬂux by minimizing the overall uncertainty. Diﬀerentiat-
ing the sum in quadrature of the contributions of Eqs.
(3) and (6) by Φ and setting the derivative to zero, we
ﬁnd the optimal value for the total number of photons
during the measurement

for which the photon and atomic noise contributions are
the same. The resultant overall uncertainty in determi-
nation of the magnetic ﬁeld in a single measurement of
length τ is:

N it is beneﬁcial to compress their dimensions down to
the wavelength of the light, maximizing the optical ro-
tation angle. In the following, in order to highlight the
sensitivity scaling with N and τ , we will set this factor
to unity, although this may be diﬃcult to achieve exper-
imentally.

Equation (11) shows that the sensitivity to the mag-
netic ﬁeld scales as N −3/4, better than the scaling N −1/2
for a usual shot-noise-limited measurement [4, 6], but still
below the result N −1 obtained in the Heisenberg limit.
Let us brieﬂy consider polarimetry with strongly
squeezed probe light [5],
for which photon noise ap-
proaches 1/(ΦAτ ) [cf. Eq. (2)]. In this case, minimiza-
tion of the uncertainty in the magnetic-ﬁeld determina-
tion leads to the optimal value of the photon ﬂux

approximation that the spins reorient only due to optical
pumping by the probe beam will fail. According to (15),
this will occur when Γrelτ = 1/√N , and for longer mea-
surement times spin-relaxation will dominate the atomic
noise. Thus, assuming that we can measure for a time
(Γrel√N )−1 (and that the preparation of the initial
T
ˆx-polarized state can be done instantaneously), the fol-
lowing strategy appears optimal: split the time T into in-
tervals of duration (Γrel√N )−1, and repeat the measure-
ment T (Γrel√N ) times. The sensitivity of an individual
measurement of a duration (Γrel√N )−1 is Γrel/(gµN 1/4),
and the total uncertainty improves as the square root of
the number of such independent measurements. Thus,
the uncertainty of a QND measurement of longer dura-
tion is

In contrast to the case of unsqueezed light (11), the de-
tuning ∆ has not cancelled.
In fact, from Eq. (13), it
would appear that δB can be decreased without limit by
increasing the detuning. However, in actuality, the sen-
sitivity cannot be improved beyond the Heisenberg limit

Equating (13) and (14), we can ﬁnd the detuning at
which the Heisenberg limit is achieved. Putting this value
of the detuning into Eqs. (12) and (4), we ﬁnd that the
number of atoms optically pumped during the measure-
ment is of order unity (i.e., their relative fraction is 1/N ,
independent of any parameters of the optimized system).
Indeed, since the Heisenberg limit is reached when the
change of one atomic spin due to the magnetic ﬁeld can
be measured, a greater number of spins must not be dis-
turbed by the light.

Returning to the case of an optimized measurement
using unsqueezed light, it is interesting to note that the
number of atoms that undergo optical pumping during
the measurement time τ is [using Eq. (10)]

(15)

d2E2
∆2 Γ0τ N = λ−1A1/2√N = √N .
Next, we examine the sensitivity using unsqueezed
probe light when the measurement is made over a long
time T . From Eq. (11), the sensitivity to the magnetic
ﬁeld goes as 1/τ , making it beneﬁcial to increase the time
as much as possible. Up until now, we have been ignoring
the ground-state spin relaxation (with rate Γrel) assum-
ing τ suﬃciently short. However, as τ is increased the

δB =

√Γrel

,

(16)

i.e., equal to the sensitivity of a conventional shot-noise-
limited magnetometer.

A similar conclusion is also reached for the case of
squeezed probe light. Assuming that the magnetometer
operates at the Heisenberg limit (14), the maximal mea-
surement time during which no relaxation events that
would spoil the sensitivity can occur is (ΓrelN )−1, which
once again leads us to the result (16). As a numerical
example, Heisenberg-limited measurements for N = 1011
and Γrel = 100 Hz are limited to 10−13 s. Conversely,
a given desired measurement time puts a similarly strin-
gent limit on the relaxation rate.

The reason that the advantage of the QND method
with respect to the conventional schemes has vanished
for long measurement times is that the latter methods
are more tolerant to spin-relaxation; a much larger frac-
tion atoms can relax or get repumped during a measure-
ment time without loss of sensitivity than for a QND
measurement [Eq. (15)].

The preceding analysis suggests the general result that,
while it is possible to perform measurements that go be-
yond the usual shot-noise limits with very short measure-
ment times, the total sensitivity can always be increased
by increasing the measurement time, which restores the
usual shot-noise scaling of the sensitivity.

Abstract

We present a theoretical scheme based on su(2) algebra to investigate
the inﬂuence of homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld on the quantum non-
demolition measurement of atomic momentum in dispersive Jaynes-
Cummings model. In the dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model, when
detuning is large and the atomic motion is in a propagating light wave,
we consider a two-level atom with quantized cavity-ﬁeld in the presence
of a homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld. We derive an eﬀective Hamilto-
nian describing the dispersive atom-ﬁeld interaction in the presence
of gravitational ﬁeld. We can see gravitational inﬂuence both on the
momentum ﬁlter and momentum distribution. Moreover, gravitational
ﬁeld decreases both tooth spacing of momentum and the width of teeth
of momentum.

Introduction

Among the models describing the interaction between light and matter, the
Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) [1] seems to be ideal. The JCM describes
the interaction between a two-level atom and a single quantized mode of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in a lossless cavity within the rotating wave approxima-
tion (RWA). This is the simplest model of the radiation-matter interaction.
It is simple enough to be exactly solved on the one hand and complicated
enough to exhibit many fascinating quantum features on the other hand.
These pure quantum eﬀects include quantum collapses and revivals of atomic
inversion [2], squeezing of the radiation ﬁeld [3] ,atomic dipole squeezing [4],
vacuum Rabi oscillation [5] and dynamical entangling and disentangling of
the atom ﬁeld system in the course of time [6-8]. Further interest the JCM
comes from the fact that its theoretical predictions have been extensively
used in the context of quantum information [9], atoms and ions trapping
[10,11] and quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements [12].

In a general QND measurement, an observable signal of a quantum sys-
tem is measured by detecting a change in an observable of the probe system
coupled to the quantum system during the measurement time, without per-
turbing the subsequent evolution of the observable signal. We can therefore
make a sequence of precise measurements of an observable signal such that
the result of each measurement is completely predictable from the result of
the preceding measurement. Such an observable is called QND observable.
Original QND ideas involved a dispersive coupling of the signal ﬁeld to a
material probe [13]. The QND method is quite generally based on dispersive
and nonlinear eﬀects. Methods to avoid the back action of the measurement
on the detected observable have been proposed and implemented in the op-
tical domain [14,15]. These experiments are the realization of the QND
schemes introduced in [13]. They rely on nonlinear coupling of the signal
ﬁeld to be measured with a probe ﬁeld whose phase is altered by a quantity
depending on the number of photons in the signal beam.
In a paper by
Sleator and Wilkens [16] it was shown a complementary scheme in which a
quadrature-component of a propagating laser wave acts as the probe for the
QND measurement of the atomic momentum. It is based on the Doppler
eﬀect on the component of atomic momentum along the propagation direc-
tion of the light ﬁeld.

On the other hand, experimentally, atomic beams with very low ve-
locities are generated in laser cooling and atomic interferometry [17]. It is
obvious that for atoms moving with a velocity of a few centimeters or meters
per second for a time period of several milliseconds or more, the inﬂuence

2

of the Earth’s acceleration becomes important and cannot be neglected [18].
For this reason it is of interest to study the temporal evolution of an atom
moving in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth and the cavity-ﬁeld. Since any
optical experiment in the laboratory is in a non-inertial frame it is important
to estimate the inﬂuence of the Earth’s acceleration on the outcome of these
experiments. The eﬀective Hamiltonian and time evolution for two-level
atom that is simultaneously exposed to the ﬁeld of a running laser wave and
a homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld is studied by Marzlin [19].

In this paper we investigate a complementary scheme based on su(2)
algebra [20] to investigate the inﬂuence of gravitation on the QND measure-
ment of atomic momentum in the dispersive JCM. In section 2 we apply
scheme with su(2) algebra to describe the interaction of a two-level atom
with quantized ﬁeld and a homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld in dispersive
JCM. Recently, optical Schr¨odinger-cat states have been realized in disper-
sive JCM [21]. Also, these states have been veriﬁed experimentally, by Auf-
feves and coworkers, for a two-level atom interacting with a single mode of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in dispersive JCM [22]. In the dispersive JCM, the
atom is in ground state and detuning is large, so one can neglect spontaneous
emission. In section 3 we investigate dynamical evolution of the system and
show that how the gravitational ﬁeld may be aﬀected the dynamical prop-
erties of the dispersive JCM. In section 4 we investigate the inﬂuence of
gravitational ﬁeld on the QND measurement. Finally, we summarize our
conclusions in section 5.

2 Dispersive Jaynes-Cummings Model in the pres-

ence of Gravitational Field

In the dispersive JCM, we assume that the atom is in its ground state ini-
tially and we consider the case of large detuning so that the excited state
of the atom is almost never populated, so we neglect spontaneous emis-
sion. The importance of dispersive JCM is because of using in generation
schr¨odinger cat states with superposition of coherent states. These states
have been generated in diﬀerent contexts. A great variety of methods have
been proposed for generate such states, for example, in a Mach-Zehnder in-
terferometer [23] and one of the ﬁrst schemes due to Yurke and Stoler [24]
who showed that a coherent state(CS) propagating in a Kerr medium could
lead to a schr¨odinger cat state. We take into account the atomic motion
along the position vector ˆ~x, so the evolution of the atom-ﬁeld system in the

a representation of su(2) algebra based on the generalized algebra and the
pauli matrices. From Hamiltonian (1), it is apparent that there exist an

3 Dynamical Evolution

In section 2, we obtained the eﬀective Hamiltonian atom-ﬁeld system in the
presence of the gravitational ﬁeld in dispersive regime. In this section, we
investigate dynamical evolution of system. We will show how the gravita-
tional ﬁeld may be aﬀected the dispersive JCM. We will also investigate the
dispersive JCM, in the short and long time limits. The Schr¨odinger equation

We now consider gravitational inﬂuence on the dynamical evolution of the
system for two limiting case. The ﬁrst, in the limit of small gravitational
inﬂuence, t << τa, means very small ~q.~g, i.e., the momentum transfer from
the laser beam to the atom is only slightly altered by the gravitational
acceleration because the latter is very small or nearly perpendicular to the
laser beam. In this limit, the state vector is

The Doppler shift detuning is independent of gravitational ﬁeld. The second,
in the limit of long times, t >> τa, the atoms are accelerated by the Earth’s
gravity so that their velocity increases and the Doppler shift detuning in
(13) is depends on the gravitational ﬁeld.

4 The QND Measurement

The QND measurement has been the subject of numerous investigations in
the past two decades [27-30]. For such a measurement on of a system, the
system must be coupled to another system (called probe), and monitored
an appropriately selected probe observable during the measurement. The
system-probe interaction has to be chosen in such a way that the corre-
sponding interaction Hamilton commutes with the system observable. The
interaction of radiation with a single atom involves the electronic degrees of
freedom of atom and center-of-mass degrees of freedom. The interaction of a
two-level atom with a standing laser wave can result in a QND measurement
of the atomic position when a quadrature component of the (suﬃciently
In the previous section
detuned) laser ﬁeld is used as the probe [31,32].
we show that how the gravitational ﬁeld could be aﬀected the dispersive
Jaynes-Cummings model. In this section we introduce QND measurement
and investigate the inﬂuence of gravitational ﬁeld on the QND measurement
of atomic motion. The Hermitian quadrature phase operator ˆY = (ˆa+ˆa†)
is
used as a probe observable for a QND measurement of conjugate momentum
ˆ~p when (17) satisﬁes condition ˆ˜H = ˆ˜H(ˆ~p), [ ˆ˜H, ˆ~p] = 0, [ ˆ˜H, ˆY ]
= 0. The prob-
ability for obtaining value Y for the quadrature phase ˆY may be expressed

5 Summary and conclusions

In this paper we have investigated the inﬂuence of gravitational ﬁeld on the
dynamical behavior of the JCM and on the QND measurement of atomic

9

momentum in dispersive JCM. For this purpose, based on su(2) algebra as
the dynamical symmetry group of the model, we have derived an eﬀective
Hamiltonian describing the dispersive atom-ﬁeld interaction in the presence
of gravitational ﬁeld. By ﬁnding an explicit form for the corresponding time
evolution operator, we have explored the inﬂuence of gravitation on the
atom-ﬁeld coupling and detuning parameter. We have shown that due to
the gravitational ﬁeld the atomic transition frequency experiences a Doppler
shift and atom-ﬁeld coupling becomes time-dependent. Then we have in-
vestigated the inﬂuence of gravitational ﬁeld on the QND measurement of
atomic momentum in dispersive JCM. Moreover, we have shown that the
gravitational ﬁeld decreases both tooth spacing of momentum and the width
of teeth of momentum.

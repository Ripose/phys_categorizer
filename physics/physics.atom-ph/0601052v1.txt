Abstract
The Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) method is applied to the calculation of the structures of a
number of positron binding systems, including e+Be, e+Mg, e+Ca and e+Sr. These calculations
were carried out in orbital spaces containing about 200 electron and 200 positron orbitals up to
ℓ = 12. Despite the very large dimensions, the binding energy and annihilation rate converge
slowly with ℓ, and the ﬁnal values do contain an appreciable correction obtained by extrapolating
the calculation to the ℓ → ∞ limit. The binding energies were 0.00317 hartree for e+Be, 0.0170
hartree for e+Mg, 0.0189 hartree for e+Ca, and 0.0131 hartree for e+Sr.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The ability of positrons to bind to a number of atoms is now well established [1, 2, 3], and
all of the group II elements of the periodic table are expected to bind a positron [1, 4]. There
have been two sets of calculations that are consistent, in that they tend to predict the same
binding energy and annihilation rate. The ﬁrst set of calculations were those undertaken
on e+Be and e+Mg [5, 6, 7] with the ﬁxed core stochastic variational method (FCSVM)
[1, 6, 8]. Some time later, conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculations were undertaken on
e+Be, e+Mg, e+Ca and e+Sr [9, 10]. The calculations for e+Be and e+Mg agreed to within
the respective computational uncertainties, which were roughly about 5-10% for the binding
energy.

One feature common to all the CI calculations is the slow convergence of the binding
energy and the annihilation rate. The attractive electron-positron interaction leads to the
formation of a Ps cluster (i.e. something akin to a positronium atom) in the outer valence
region of the atom [1, 6, 11, 12]. The accurate representation of a Ps cluster using only
single particle orbitals centered on the nucleus requires the inclusion of orbitals with much
higher angular momenta than a roughly equivalent electron-only calculation [11, 13, 14, 15].
For example, the largest CI calculations on the group II positronic atoms and PsH have
typically have involved single particles bases with 8 radial function per angular momenta, ℓ,
and inclusion of angular momenta up to Lmax = 10 [9, 10, 12]. Even with such large orbital
basis sets, between 5-60% of the binding energy and some 30-80% of the annihilation rate
were obtained by extrapolating from Lmax = 10 to the Lmax = ∞ limit.

Since our initial CI calculations [9, 10, 16], advances in computer hardware mean larger
dimension CI calculations are possible. In addition, program improvements have removed
the chief memory bottleneck that previously constrained the size of the calculation. As a
result, it is now appropriate to revisit the group II atoms to obtain improved estimates of
their positron binding energies and other expectation values. The new calculations that we
have performed have orbital spaces more than twice as large as those reported previously.
The estimated CI binding energies for all systems have increased, and furthermore the
uncertainties resulting from the partial wave extrapolation have decreased.

II. CALCULATION METHOD

The CI method as applied to atomic systems with two valence electrons and a positron has
been discussed previously [9, 10], and only a brief description is given here. All calculations
were done in the ﬁxed core approximation. The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the system with
Ne = 2 valence electrons and a positron was

The index 0 denotes the positron, while i and j denote the electrons. The direct potential
(Vdir) represents the interaction with the electronic core, which was derived from a Hartree-
Fock (HF) wave function of the neutral atom ground state. The exchange potential (Vexc)
between the valence electrons and the HF core was computed without approximation.

The one-body and two-body polarization potentials (Vp1 and Vp2) are semi-empirical with
the short-range cut-oﬀ parameters derived by ﬁtting to the spectra of their singly ionized
ions. All details of the core-polarization potentials including the polarizabilities, αd, are
given in [9, 10]. Note that the functional form of the polarization potential,Vp1, was set to
be the same for the electrons and the positron.

The positronic atom wave function is a linear combination of states created by multiplying
atomic states to single particle positron states with the usual Clebsch-Gordan coupling
coeﬃcients ;

|Ψ; LSi =

ci,j hLiMiℓjmj|LMLihSiMSi

2µj|SMSi

Xi,j

× Φi(Atom; LiSi)φj(r0) .

In this expression Φi(Atom; LiSi) is an antisymmetric atomic wave function with good L
and S quantum numbers. The function φj(r0) is a single positron orbital. The single particle
orbitals are written as a product of a radial function and a spherical harmonic:

φ(r) = P (r)Ylm(ˆr) .

As the calculations were conducted in a ﬁxed core model we used HF calculations of the
neutral atom ground states to construct the core orbitals. These HF orbitals were computed
with a program that can represent the radial wave functions as a linear combination of Slater
Type Orbitals (STO) [17].

A linear combination of STOs and Laguerre Types Orbitals (LTOs) was used to describe
the radial dependence of electrons occupying orbitals with the same angular momentum
as those in the ground state. Orbitals that did not have any core orbitals with the same
angular momentum were represented by a LTO set with a common exponential parameter.
The STOs give a good representation of the wave function in the interior region while the
LTOs largely span the valence region. The LTO basis [9, 10] has the property that the
basis can be expanded toward completeness without introducing any linear independence
problems.

The CI basis included all the possible L = 0 conﬁgurations that could be formed by
letting the two electrons and positron populate the single particle orbitals subject to two
selection rules,

(2)

(3)

(4)
(5)

max(ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lmax ,
min(ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lint .

In these rules ℓ0 is the positron orbital angular momentum, while ℓ1 and ℓ2 are the angular
momenta of the electrons. A large value of Lmax is necessary as the attractive electron-
positron interaction causes a pileup of electron density in the vicinity of the positron. The
Lint parameter was used to eliminate conﬁgurations involving the simultaneous excitation
of both electrons into high ℓ states. Calculations on PsH and e+Be had shown that the
choice of Lint = 3 could reduce the dimension of the CI basis by a factor of 2 while having

3

an eﬀect of about 1% upon the binding energy and annihilation rate [9]. The present set of
calculations were all performed with Lint = 4.

Various expectation values were computed to provide information about the structure of
these systems. The mean distance of the electron and positron from the nucleus are denoted
by hrei and hrpi. The 2γ annihilation rate for annihilation with the core and valence electrons
was computed with the usual expressions [18, 19, 20]. The 2γ rate for the core (Γc) and
valence (Γv) electrons are tabulated separately.

A. Extrapolation issues

The feature that diﬀerentiates mixed electron-positron CI calculations from purely elec-
tron CI calculations is the slow convergence of the calculation with respect to Lmax, the
maximum ℓ of any electron or positron orbital included in the CI basis. Typically, a cal-
culation is made to Lmax ≈ 10 (or greater), with various extrapolation techniques used to
estimate the Lmax → ∞ correction. For any expectation value one can write formally

where ∆X L is the increment to the observable that occurs when the maximum orbital
angular momentum is increased from L−1 to L, e.g.

Hence, one can write formally

hXiLmax =

∆X L ,

Lmax

XL=0

∆X L = hXiL − hXiL−1 .

hXi = hXiLmax +

∆X L .

∞

XL=Lmax+1

However, it is quite easy to make substantial errors in estimating the Lmax → ∞ correction
[21, 22, 23]. There have been a number of investigations of the convergence of CI expansions
for electronic and mixed electron-positron systems [1, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. The
reliability of the diﬀerent methods to estimate the Lmax → ∞ correction for the energy and
annihilation rate has been assessed in detail elsewhere [22]. In this work, only the briefest
description of the recommended methods are described.

The recent computational investigations of helium [31] and some positron-atom systems

[22] suggest that usage of an inverse power series of the generic type

is the best way to determine the Lmax → ∞ correction for the energy, E and the 2γ annihi-
lation rate. A three term series with n = 4 is used for the energy. One needs four successive
values of EL to determine the coeﬃcients BE, CE and DE. Once the coeﬃcients have been
ﬁxed, the inverse power series is summed to Jmax = 100,after which the approximate result

∆X Lmax =

is used [23].

The correction to Γ follows the same general procedure as the energy, but with two
diﬀerences. The power in eq. (9) is set to n = 2 and only 2-terms are retained in the series
(requiring three successive values of ΓL).

The usage of the inverse power series is the preferred approach when the asymptotic form
for ∆X L has been established by perturbation theory. For other operators it is best to to
use a single-term inverse power series with an indeterminate power, e.g

∆X L =

A
(L + 1

2)p .

The factors A and p can be determined from the three largest calculations using

Once p and A are determined, the Lmax → ∞ correction can be included using the same
procedure as adopted for the multi-term ﬁts to the energy and annihilation. This method is
used in determination of the Lmax → ∞ estimates of hrei, hrpi and Γc. However, the value
of p is computed for all operators since it is useful to know whether pE and pΓv are close to
the expected values of 4 and 2 respectively. While the subdivision of the annihilation rate
into core and valence components is convenient for physical interpretation, it was also done
on mathematical grounds. The calculation of Γc does not explicitly include correlations
between the core electrons and the positron, and so the ∆ΓL
increments converge faster
c
than the ∆ΓL

v increments (i.e. pΓc > pΓv).

III. CALCULATION RESULTS

A.

Improved FCSVM data for e+Be and e+Mg

The FCSVM [1, 6] has also been applied to determine the structures of e+Be and e+Mg
[6, 7]. The FCSVM expands the wave function as a linear combination of explicitly correlated
gaussians (ECGs), with the core orbitals taken from a HF calculation. One- and two-body
polarization potentials are included while orthogonality of the active electrons with the core
is enforced by the use of an orthogonalizing pseudo-potential [1, 6, 32]. The FCSVM model
hamiltonians are very similar to those used in the CI calculations. But there are some small
diﬀerences in detail that lead to the FCSVM hamiltonian giving slightly diﬀerent energies.
The best previous FCSVM wave function for e+Be [7] gave a binding energy, 0.03147
hartree, and annihilation rate 0.420 × 109 sec−1,that were close to convergence. Some exten-
sive re-optimizations seeking to improve the quality of the wave function in the asymptotic
region yielded only minor changes (of the order of 1%) in the ground state properties [33].
Nevertheless, the latest energies and expectation values for the e+Be ground state are tab-
ulated in Tables I and II. These values should be converged to better than 1% with respect
to further enlargement and optimization of the ECG basis.

The more complex core for Mg does slow the convergence of the energy and other prop-
erties of e+Mg considerably [1]. The best energy previously reported for this system was

5

0.016096 hartree [33]. The current best wave function, which is constructed from a linear
combination of 1200 ECGs gives a binding energy of 0.016930 hartree and a valence annihila-
tion rate of 1.0137 × 109 sec−1. Other expectation values are listed in Table I. Examination
of the convergence pattern during the series of basis set enlargements and optimizations
suggests that the binding energy and annihilation rate are converged to between 2% and
5%.

The FCSVM binding energies do have a weak dependence on one parameter in the cal-

culation since the orthogonalizing pseudo-potential is actually a penalty function, viz

λ ˆP =

λ|φiihφi| ,

Xi ∈ core

(14)

that was added to the hamiltonian. Choosing λ to be large and positive means the energy
minimization automatically acts to construct a wave function which has very small overlap
with the core [6, 32, 34]. The FCSVM properties reported in Tables I and II were computed
with λ = 105 hartree. The core overlap (i.e. the expectation value of ˆP ) was 1.86 × 10−11
for e+Be and 1.61 × 10−10 for e+Mg.

B. CI results for group II atoms

Table I contains the results of the current series of calculations on the four positronic
atoms. The size of the calculations for the four atoms were almost the same. The electron-
electron angular momentum selector was set to Lint = 4. For ℓ > 3 at least 15 LTOs
were included in the radial basis sets for the electron and positron orbitals. For ℓ ≤ 2 the
dimension of the orbital basis sets were slightly larger than 15 and the basis sets for electrons
occupying orbitals with the same angular momentum as those in the core were typically a
mix of STOs (to describe the electron close to nucleus) and LTOs. The calculations used
basis sets with Lmax = 9, 10, 11 and 12. The calculations with Lmax < 12 had conﬁguration
spaces which were subsets of the Lmax = 12 and this expedited the computations since one
list of radial matrix elements was initially generated for the Lmax = 12 basis and then reused
for the smaller basis sets.

The secular equations that arose typically had dimensions of about 500,000 and the
diagonalizations were performed with the Davidson algorithm using a modiﬁed version of
the program of Stathopolous and Froese-Fischer [35]. Convergence was not very quick and
about 16000 iterations were needed to achieve convergence in some cases. It was possible
to speed up the diagonalization for Lmax < 12. An edited eigenvector from the Lmax = 12
calculation was used as the initial eigenvector estimate, and this often reduced the number
of iterations required by 50%.

1. Results for e+Be

The lowest energy dissociation channel is the e+ + Be channel, which has an energy of
−1.01181167 hartree with respect to the doubly ionized Be2+ core. The agreement of the
extrapolated CI binding energy of ε = 0.003169 hartree with the FCSVM binding energy
of ε = 0.003180 is better than 1%. A similar level of agreement exists for the hrei and hrpi
expectation values.

6

The only expectation value for which 1% level of agreement does not occur is the anni-
hilation rate and here the extrapolated CI value of 0.4110 × 109 sec−1 is only about 3.5%
smaller than the FCSVM of 0.4267×109 sec−1. However, it is known that the convergence of
the annihilation rate with respect to an increasing number of radial basis functions is slower
than the convergence of the energy [22, 31]. This means that a CI type calculation has an
inherent tendency to underestimate the annihilation rate. For example, a CI calculation on
PsH of similar size to the present e+Be calculation underestimated the annihilation rate by
6% [22]. That the exponent of the polar law decay, pΓv = 2.10, is larger than the expected
asymptotic value of p = 2.0 is consistent with this idea. A better estimate of the annihilation
rate can be obtained by simply forcing CΓ to be zero in eq. (9) and thus using ∆Γ12 to ﬁt
BΓ. When this is done done the annihilation rate increases to 0.4178 × 109 sec−1.

2. Results for e+Mg

The results of the calculations with e+Mg are listed in Table I. The lowest energy
dissociation channel is to e+ + Mg, which has an energy of −0.83291427 hartree with respect
to the doubly ionized Mg2+ core.

The CI calculations, reported in Table I for Lmax = 9, 10, 11 and 12 are largely consistent
with the FCSVM calculations. The largest explicit CI calculation gives a binding energy
of 0.015658 hartree. Extrapolation to the Lmax → ∞ limit adds about 10% to the binding
energy, and the ﬁnal estimate was 0.017040 hartree. Despite the better than 1% agreement
between the CI and FCSVM calculations, a further binding energy increase of about 1-2%
would be conceivable if both calculations were taken to the variational limit.

The slow convergence of Γv with Lmax is evident from Table I and the extrapolation
correction contributes about 36% to the overall annihilation rate. The present Lmax → ∞
estimate can be expected to be too small by 5-10%.

All the other expectation values listed in Table I lie with 1-2% of those of the FCSVM
expectation values. As a general rule, inclusion of the Lmax → ∞ corrections generally
improves the agreement between the CI and FCSVM calculations.

3. Results for e+Ca

The results of the calculations with e+Ca are listed in Table I. Since neutral calcium
has an ionization potential smaller than the energy of Ps ground state (the present model
potential and electron orbital basis gives -0.43628656 hartree for the Ca+ energy and -
0.65966723 hartree for the neutral Ca energy), its lowest energy dissociation channel is the
Ps + Ca+ channel. The present model potential gives this channel an energy of −0.68628656
hartree.

The energies listed in Table I indicate that e+Ca is the positronic atom with the largest
known binding energy, namely ε = 0.018929 hartree. The Lmax → ∞ correction contributes
20 % of the binding energy. The partial wave series is more slowly convergent for e+Ca than
for e+Mg (i.e. pE is smaller, and the coeﬃcients CE and DE in eq. (10) are larger). This is
expected since calcium has a smaller ionization potential, and so the electrons are located a
greater distance away from the nucleus. This makes it easier for the positron to attract the
electrons, and the stronger pileup of electron density around the positron further from the
nucleus requires a longer partial wave expansion to represent correctly.

7

The slower convergence of the wave function with Lmax makes an even larger impact on
the annihilation rate. Some 41% of the annihilation rate of Γv = 1.478 × 109 sec−1 comes
from the Lmax → ∞ correction. As mentioned earlier for e+Mg, it is likely that this value is
slightly smaller than the true annihilation rate.

The extrapolation corrections for hrpi and Γc listed in Table I are unreliable. The e+Ca
system, at large distances consists of Ca+ + Ps. In other calculations of positron binding
systems it has been noticed that systems that decay asymptotically into Ps + X do not have
an hrpi that changes monotonically with Lmax [9, 16]. Initially, the positron becomes more
tightly bound to the system as Lmax increases, resulting in a decrease in hrpi. However, hrpi
tends to increase at the largest values of Lmax. The net result of all this is that ∆hrpiL (and
by implication ∆ΓL
c ) approach their asymptotic forms very slowly. The best policy is to
simply not to give any credence to the extrapolation corrections for either of these operators
for e+Ca (and e+Sr). The small value of p for ∆hreiL suggests that the reliability of the
Lmax → ∞ correction may be degraded for this expectation value as well.

4. Results for e+Sr

The results of the calculations for e+Sr are listed in Table I. Since neutral strontium has an
ionization potential smaller than the energy of Ps ground state (the present model potential
and electron orbital basis gives -0.40535001 hartree for the Sr+ energy and -0.61299101
hartree for the neutral Sr energy), its lowest energy dissociation channel is the Ps + Sr+
channel, which has an energy of -0.65535001 hartree. The small ionization potential of
0.20764100 hartree means that the structure of the e+Sr ground state will be dominated by
a Ψ(Sr+)Ψ(Ps) type conﬁguration [1]. This leads to slower convergence of the ground state
with Lmax which is evident from Table I.

As expected, the binding energy of e+Sr is smaller than that of e+Ca. Previous inves-
tigations have indicated that positron binding energies should be largest for atoms with
ionization potentials closest to 0.250 hartree (the Ps binding energy) [4, 36]. There is obvi-
ously some uncertainty in the precise determination of the binding energy due to fact that
Lmax → ∞ correction constitutes some 37% of the binding energy of 0.013102 hartree. The
net eﬀect of errors due to the extrapolation correction are not expected to be excessive. Ap-
plying eq. (9) with only the ﬁrst two-terms retained (i.e. DE = 0) results in a ﬁnal energy
0.012764 hartree, which is 3% smaller than the value of 0.013102 Hartree. The present e+Sr
binding energy is some 30% larger than the energy of the previous CI calculation listed in
Table II [10].

The ﬁnal estimate of the valence annihilation rate was 1.553 × 109 sec−1 and some 43%
of the annihilation rate comes from the Lmax → ∞ correction. This value of Γv could easily
be 10% smaller than the true annihilation rate. The explicitly calculated expectation values
for hrei, hrpi and Γc at Lmax = 12 should be preferred since the Lmax → ∞ corrections in
these cases are likely to be unreliable.

C. 3-body clustering

While the truncation of the basis to Lint = 4 has little eﬀect on the e+Be system, its
eﬀect is larger for the e+Sr system. The more loosely bound alkaline-earth atoms have their
electrons localized further away from the nucleus, and this makes it easier for the positron

8

to form something like a Ps− cluster [4, 37]. When this occurs, correlations of the positron
with both electrons increase in strength, and the inclusion of conﬁgurations with Lint > 4
becomes more important.

The relative size of of these neglected Lint > 4 conﬁgurations can be estimated using
techniques similar to those adopted for the Lmax → ∞ corrections. Calculations for a
succession of Lint values were performed in earlier works [9, 10]. The assumption is made
2)4 (note, the
that the binding energy and annihilation rate increments scale as A/(Lint + 1
power of 4 for the annihilation is used since Lint only has a directly eﬀect on electron-electron
correlations). The diﬀerence between an Lint = 2 and Lint = 3 is used to estimate A and
then eq.( 10) determines the Lint → ∞ correction (in the case of e+Be calculations up to
Lint = 10 exist [9]).

Table II contains a summary of the ﬁnal binding energies obtained from the present CI
calculations, and earlier binding energies obtained alternate methods. As part of this table,
energies with an additional Lint → ∞ correction are also given. The size of the correction
ranges from 1.8 × 10−5 hartree for e+Be to 21.9 × 10−5 hartree for e+Sr. Even though these
estimations of the correction are not rigorous, they indicate that the underestimation in the
binding energy resulting from a truncation of the conﬁguration space to Lint < 4 is most
likely to be 2% or smaller.

A similar analysis could be done for the annihilation rate but previous results indicate
that Γv is less sensitive than ε to an increase in Lint [9, 10]. The net increases in Γv for e+Be,
e+Mg, e+Ca and e+Sr were 0.0011 × 109 sec−1, 0.0030 × 109 sec−1, 0.0039 × 109 sec−1 and
0.0039 × 109 sec−1 respectively. All of these extra contributions to Γv correspond to changes
of less than 0.5%.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The summary of binding energies, produced by the current methods and other completely
diﬀerent approaches presented in Table II shows that the only methods that consistently
agree with each other are the CI and FCSVM calculations. Both these methods are varia-
tional in nature, both use realistic model potentials designed on very similar lines, and both
have shown a tendency for the binding energies to slowly creep upwards as the calculation
size is increased (refer to refs [1, 6, 10] for examples of earlier and slightly smaller binding
energies). The PO and MBPT approaches do not give reliable binding energies.

The diﬀusion Monte Carlo method [38] gives an e+Mg binding energy of 0.0168±0.0014
hartree which is very close to the present energy. This calculation was fully ab-initio and
did not use the ﬁxed core approximation. However, application of the same diﬀusion Monte
Carlo method to e+Be gave a binding energy which is only half the size of the present value.
The present binding energies are all larger than those given previously [9, 10] due to
the usage of a radial basis which was almost twice the size of earlier calculations. In two
cases, +Ca and e+Sr the increase in binding energy exceeds 10%. The binding energies for
e+Be and e+Mg are in agreement with those of FCSVM calculations to within their mutual
uncertainties. Further enlargement of the basis could lead to the positron binding energies
for Mg, Ca and Sr increasing by a few percent.

Estimates of the annihilation rate have also been extracted from the CI wave functions.
The present annihilation rates are certainly underestimates of the true annihilation rate.
The annihilation rate converges very slowly with respect to the radial basis and similar
sized calculations on PsH suggest that the present annihilation rates could easily be too

9

small by at least 5% [22, 31, 42].

The speed at which the partial wave expansion converges with respect to Lmax is seen
to decrease as the ionization energy of the parent atom decreases [1, 10]. In addition, the
importance of 3-body clustering (i.e. convergence with respect to Lint) was seen to increase
as the ionization energy of the parent atom decreased [4].

The main factor limiting the size of the calculations now is the time taken to perform
the diagonalizations. Although, the calculations were performed on a Linux/Myrinet-based
cluster, the sheer number of iterations, (16000 in the worst case), used by the Davidson
method, meant that it could take 30 days to perform a diagonalization using 24 CPUs.
However, the main reason for adopting the Davidson method was the availability of a pro-
gram that was easy to modify [35]. Usage of the more general Lanczos method [43] might
lead to a quicker diagonalization and thus permit even larger calculations.

TABLE I: Results of CI calculations for positronic alkaline-earth atoms for a given Lmax. The
E column gives the three-body energy with respect to the doubly ionized frozen core and ε is the
binding energy with respect to the lowest energy dissociation channel. The Γv and Γc columns give
the valence and core annihilation rate (in 109 sec−1) . The results in the row 10∗ are taken from
earlier CI calculations for these systems [9, 10] with Lmax = 10 (and Lint = 3). The results in the
row ∞ use the methods described in the body of the text to evaluate the Lmax → ∞ correction.
The exponent p characterizes the rate of decay of the expectation value increments evaluated at
Lmax = 12 using eq. (12).

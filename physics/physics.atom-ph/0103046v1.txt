We study both experimentally and theoretically the losses
induced by parametric excitation in far–oﬀ–resonance optical
lattices. The atoms conﬁned in a 1D sinusoidal lattice present
an excitation spectrum and dynamics substantially diﬀerent
from those expected for a harmonic potential. We develop a
model based on the actual atomic Hamiltonian in the lattice
and we introduce semiempirically a broadening of the width
of lattice energy bands which can physically arise from in-
homogeneities and ﬂuctuations of the lattice, and also from
atomic collisions. The position and strength of the parametric
resonances and the evolution of the number of trapped atoms
are satisfactorily described by our model.

I. INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon of parametric excitation of the mo-
tion of cold trapped atoms has recently been the sub-
ject of several theoretical and experimental investigations
[1–3]. The excitation caused by resonant amplitude noise
has been proposed as one of the major sources of heating
in far–oﬀ–resonance optical traps (FORTs), where the
heating due to spontaneous scattering forces is strongly
reduced [4]. In particular, the eﬀect of resonant excita-
tion is expected to be particularly important in optical
lattices, which usually provide a very strong conﬁnement
to the atoms, resulting in a large vibrational frequency
and in a correspondingly large transfer of energy from
the noise ﬁeld to the atoms [1].

Nevertheless, parametric excitation is not only a source
of heating, but it also represents a very useful tool to
characterize the spring constant of a FORT or in general
of a trap for cold particles, and to study the dynamics of
the trapped gas. Indeed, the trap frequencies can be mea-
sured by intentionally exciting the trap vibrational modes
with a small modulation of the amplitude of the trap-
ping potential, which results in heating [5] or losses [2,6]
for the trapped atoms when the modulation frequency
is tuned to twice the oscillation frequency. This proce-
dure usually yields frequencies that satisfactorily agree
with calculated values, and are indeed expected to be
accurate for the atoms at the bottom of the trapping po-
tential. From the measured trap frequencies is then pos-
sible to estimate quantities such as the trap depth and
the number and phase space densities of trapped atoms.

We note that this kind of measurement is particularly
important in optical lattices, since the spatial resolution
of standard imaging techniques is usually not enough to
estimate the atomic density from a measurement of the
volume of a single lattice site.

Recently, 1D lattices have proved to be the proper envi-
ronment to study collisional processes in large and dense
samples of cold atoms, using a trapping potential inde-
pendent for the magnetic state of the atoms.
In this
systems, the parametric excitation of the energetic vi-
brational mode along the lattice provides an eﬃcient way
to investigate the cross-dimensional rethermalization dy-
namics mediated by elastic collisions [7,6].

Most theoretical studies of parametric excitation rely
on a classical [8] or quantum [1] harmonic approximation
of the conﬁning potential. Under certain circumstances
these expressions show quite good agreement with exper-
imental results [3]. However, general features of the opti-
cal lattice could be lost in these approaches. For example,
a sinusoidal potential exhibits an energy band structure
and a spread of transition energies, while harmonic oscil-
lators have just a discrete equidistant spectrum. Thus,
we might expect that the excitation process may happen
at several frequencies, and with a non-negligible band-
width. Such anharmonic eﬀects can be important when-
ever the atoms are occupying a relatively large fraction
of the lattice energy levels. The purpose of this paper is
to give a simple description of parametric excitation in
a sinusoidal 1D lattice. In the next Section, we brieﬂy
discuss general features of the stationary states on such
a lattice. Then, we summarize the harmonic description
given in Ref. [1] and extend it to the anharmonic case.
By a numerical evaluation of transition rates, we make
a temporal description of parametric excitation which is
compared with experimental results. We discuss about
the relevance of broadening of the spectral lines to un-
derstand the excitation process in this kind of systems.
Some conclusions are given in the last Section.

Thus, the width of the r-band can be estimated using

10.5¯hω0. While the lowest
optical lattice having V0 ∼
18¯hω0, the band
band r = 0 has a negligible width
widths for highest lying levels r = 10, 11, 12,and 13 would
respectively be 0.0065 ,0.1036, 1.52, and 20.56 in units of
¯hω0.

In order to determine the energy spectrum, a varia-
tional calculation can be performed. We considered a
harmonic oscillator basis set centered in a given site of
the lattice, and with frequency ω0. The diagonalization
of the Hamiltonian matrix associated to (2.4) using 40
basis functions gives the eigenvalues En < V0 shown in
Table I for V0 = 10.5¯hω0. According to the results of last
paragraph, the eigenvalues 12 and 13 belong to the same
band while the band width for lower levels is smaller than
0.11¯hω0

III. PARAMETRIC EXCITATION

trapped atoms consists in applying a small modulation

Classically, parametric harmonic oscillators exhibit
resonances not just at 2ω0 but also at 2ω0/n with n any
natural number [8]. In fact, the resonances corresponding
to n=2, i.e. at an excitation frequency ω0, have been ob-
served in optical lattices [2,6]. A quantum description of
parametric harmonic excitation also predicts resonances
at the same frequencies via n-th order perturbation the-
ory [10]. In particular, the presence of the resonance at
ω0 can be justiﬁed with the following argument. Accord-

These ideas can be directly extended to anharmonic
potentials: the corresponding transition probability rates
R(n, m) would be determined by the transition matrix
T (n, m), by the transition frequencies ωnm and by the
time dependence of the excitation ǫ(t). In general, an-
harmonic transition matrix elements T (n, m) will be dif-
ferent from zero for a wider set of pairs (n, m). Besides,
the transition energies will not be unique so that the exci-
tation process is not determined by the excitation power
spectrum at a single given frequency 2ω0 and its sub-
harmonics 2ωo/n. As an example the transition energies
for the speciﬁc potential considered in this work are re-
ported in Table I. Therefore, within the model Hamilto-
nian of Eq. (3.1), resonance eﬀects can occur for several
frequencies that may alter the shape of the population
distribution within the trap. However, in general these
resonant excitations will not be associated with the es-
cape of trapped atoms.

Here we are interested in a 1D lattice; the direct ex-
tension of the formalism mentioned above requires the
evaluation of the matrix elements T (n, m) among the
diﬀerent Mathieu states that conform a band. This in-
volves integrals which, to our knowledge, lack an ana-
lytical expression and require numerical evaluation. As
an alternative, we consider functions which variationally
approximate the Mathieu functions. They are the eigen-
states of the Hamiltonian (2.4) in a harmonic basis set of
frequency ω0:

It is recognized that any discrete basis set approxima-
tion to a system with a band spectrum will lack fea-
tures of the original problem which have to be care-
fully analyzed. Anyway, alternatives to a discrete ba-
sis approach may be cumbersome and not necessarily
yield a better approach to understand general proper-
ties of experimental data. While the discrete basis ap-
proach is exact for transitions between the lowest levels,
which have a negligible width, eigenstates belonging to
a band of measurably width should be treated with spe-
cial care. Thus, we shall assume that matrix elements

cuss below. Broad spectral lines can be introduced in our

IV. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS.

We have tested the procedure described in last section
to model parametric excitation in a speciﬁc experiment
conducted at LENS. In this experiment 40K fermionic
atoms are trapped in a 1D lattice, realized retroreﬂect-
ing linearly polarized light obtained from a single–mode
Ti:Sa laser at λ=787 nm, detuned on the red of both
the D1 and D2 transition of potassium, respectively at
769.9 nm, and 766.7 nm. The laser radiation propagates
along the vertical direction, to provide a strong conﬁne-
ment against gravity. The laser beam is weakly focused
90 µm,
within a two-lens telescope to a waist size w0 ≃
with a Rayleigh length zR=3 cm; the eﬀective running
power at the waist position is P =350 mW.

The trap is loaded from a magneto-optical trap
(MOT), thanks to a compression procedure already de-
105 atoms at a density
scribed in [6], with about 5
around 1011 cm−
3. The typical vertical extension of the
trapped atomic cloud, as detected with a CCD camera
(see Fig. 1), is 500 µm, corresponding to about 1200 oc-
cupied lattice sites with an average of 400 atoms in each
site. Since the axial extension of the atomic cloud is much
smaller than zR, we can approximate the trap potential
to

×

(4.1)

w2

thus neglecting a 5% variation of V0 along the lattice.
The atomic temperature in the lattice direction is mea-
sured with a time–of–ﬂight technique and it is about
50 µK.

≃

In order to parametrically excite the atoms we modu-
late the intensity of the conﬁning laser with a fast AOM
100 ms, with a sine of amplitude
for a time interval T
ǫ=3% and frequency Ω. The variation of the number
of trapped atoms is measured by illuminating the atoms
with the MOT beams and collecting the resulting ﬂuo-
rescence on a photomultiplier.
In Fig.2 the fraction of
atoms left in the trap after the parametric excitation is
reported vs the modulation frequency Ω/2π. Three res-
onances in the trap losses are clearly seen at modulation
frequencies 340 kHz, 670 kHz and 1280 kHz. By identify-
ing the ﬁrst two resonances with the lattice vibrational
frequency and its ﬁrst harmonic, respectively, we get as
ﬁrst estimate ω0 ≃
340 kHz. As we will show in the
following, these resonance are actually on the red of ω0
and 2ω0, respectively, and therefore a better estimate is
360 kHz. Therefore the eﬀective trap depth is,
ω0 ≃
×
10.5 ¯hω0. Since the atomic
from Eq. (9), V0 ≃
≃
temperature is about V0/3.5, we expect that most of the
energy levels of the lattice have a nonnegligible popu-
lation and therefore the anharmonicity of the potential
could play an important role in the dynamics of paramet-
ric excitation. Note that the third resonance at high fre-
quency, close to 4ω0, is not predicted from the harmonic
theory. It is possible to observe also a much weaker reso-
nance in the trap losses around 1.5 kHz, which we inter-
pret to be twice the oscillation frequency in the loosely
conﬁned radial direction. Anyway, in the following we
will focus our attention just on the axial resonances.

As discussed in the previous Section, the overall width
of the excitation assumed for our model system could
play an important role in reproducing essential features
of experimental data. Since the source used in the ex-
periment has a negligible line width, it is necessary to
model just the broadening of the atomic resonances. The
spread of the transition energies due to the axial anhar-
monicity is reported in Table I, while the broadening of
each energy level, due to the periodic character of the
sine potential, is estimated using Eq. (2.8). We now note
that the 1D motion assumed in Section II is not com-
pletely valid in our case, since the atoms move radially
along a Gaussian potential. Since the period of the radial
motion is about 500 times longer than the axial period,
the atoms see an eﬀective axial frequency which varies
with their radial position, resulting in a broadening of
the transition frequency. Other sources of broadening
are ﬂuctuations of the laser intensity and pointing, and
inhomogeneities along the lattice. We note that also elas-
tic collisions within the trapped sample, which tend to
keep a thermal distribution of the trap levels population,
can contribute to an overall broadening of the loss res-
onances. Since it is not easy to build a model which
involve all these sources, we introduce semiempirically
an eﬀective broadening for the r-th level (see Eq. (3.14)).

higher (lower) values of λ0,1 together with slightly higher
(lower) values of the power p. In Table I the resulting
widths are shown for the lower twelve levels. Note that
we have intentionally excluded levels 11, 12 and 13 from
the calculation, since their intrinsic width is so large that
the atoms can tunnel out of the trap along the lattice in
much less than 100 ms [9]. Anyway, the inclusion of these
levels proved not to change substantially the result of the
simulation.

As already anticipated, the principal resonance in trap
losses appears at Ω
1.85 ω0. This result follows from
the fact that the excitation of the lowest trap levels is
not resulting in a loss of atoms, as it would happen for a
harmonic potential. On the contrary, the most energetic
atoms, which have a vibrational frequency smaller than
the harmonic one, are easily excited out of the trap. The
asymmetry of the resonances, which has been observed
also in [2], is well reproduced in the calculations and it is a
further evidence of the spread of the vibrational frequen-
cies. The ﬁrst interesting result obtained by our study
of parametric excitation is therefore the correction nec-
essary to extract the actual harmonic frequency from the
loss spectrum. For the speciﬁc conditions of the present
experiment, we ﬁnd indeed that the principal resonance
in the trap losses appears at Ω
1.85 ω0. Anyway, the
calculation shows that the resonance is nearby this po-
sition for all the explored values of λ0,1 and p also for
deeper traps, up to V0=25 ¯hω0, and therefore it appears
to be an invariant characteristic of the sinusoidal poten-
tial.

≃

The result of the numerical integration of Eqs. (3.12)
reported in Fig.3 reproduces relatively well the subhar-
monic resonance, which in the harmonic case would be
expected at ω0. On the contrary, both experiment and
calculation show that the actual position of the resonance
is Ω
0.9 ω0. It must be mentioned that the accuracy of
these results is restricted by the ﬁnite diﬀerence charac-
ter of Eqs. (3.12) and by the fact that some noise sources
which have not been included could be resonant at a
nearby frequency. In particular, a possible modulation
of the laser pointing associated to the intensity modula-
tion is expected to be resonant at Ω = ω0 in the harmonic

≃

The higher order resonance around 3.5 ω0 observed in
the experiment is also well reproduced by the calcula-
tions based on ﬁrst order perturbation theory. Note that
a simpler approximation to the conﬁning potential by a
quartic potential VQ(z) = k2z2 + k4z4 would yield a reso-
nance around 4 ω0 and not 3.5 ω0. Anyway, it is possible
to understand qualitatively one of the features of this
resonance considering a quartic perturbation of the form
ǫ(t)VQ to a harmonic potential. In this case the ratio of
the transition rates at the 2ω0 and 4ω0 resonances is set
by Eqs.3.2 to

This result can qualitatively explain the absence of the
corresponding high order resonance in the radial excita-
tion spectrum (see Fig.2): since the radial trap frequency
is a factor 500 smaller than the axial one, the relative
strength of such radial anharmonic resonance is expected
to be suppressed by a factor (500)2. In conclusion, high
harmonics resonances, which certainly depend on the ac-
tual shape of the anharmonic potential, are expected to
appear only if the spring constant of the trap is large.

In Fig.4 theoretical and experimental results for the
evolution of the total population of trapped atoms at the
resonant exciting frequency Ω = 2ω0 are shown. Al-
though there is a satisfactory agreement between the
model and the experiment, we notice that experimental
data exhibit a diﬀerent rate for the loss of atoms be-
fore and after 100 ms. This change is probably due to a
variation of the collision rate as the number of trapped
atoms is modiﬁed, which cannot be easily included in the
model. The comparison of the experimental evolution of
the trap population with and without modulation shows
the eﬀectiveness of the excitation process in emptying the
trap on a short time-scale.

We have also simulated the energy growth of the
trapped atoms due to the parametric excitation, which
is reported in Fig. 5. Our calculations show nonexponen-
tial energy increase in contrast with what expected in
the harmonic approximation, Eq. (3.7). The fast energy
growth at short times is related to the depopulation of
the lowest levels, which are resonant with the 2ω0 para-
metric source. The saturation eﬀect observed for longer
times is due to the fact that the resonance condition is
not satisﬁed for the upper levels so that they do not de-
populate easily.

V. CONCLUSIONS.

We have studied both theoretically and experimentally
the time evolution of the population of atoms trapped in
a 1D sinusoidal optical lattice, following a parametric
excitation of the lattice vibrational mode. In detail, we

5

have presented a theoretical model for the excitation in
an anharmonic potential, which represents an extension
of the previous harmonic models, and we have applied
it to the actual sinusoidal potential used to trap cold
potassium atoms. The simulation seems to reproduce
relatively well the main features of both the spectrum
of trap losses, including the appearance of resonances
beyond 2ω0, and the time evolution of the total number
of trapped atoms.

By comparing the theoretical predictions and the ex-
perimental observations the usefulness of a parametric
excitation procedure to characterize the spring constant
of the trap has been veriﬁed. Although the loss reso-
nances are red-shifted and wider than what expected in
the harmonic case, the lattice harmonic frequency can be
easily extracted from the experimental spectra, to esti-
mate useful quantities such as the trap depth and spring
constant.

We have also made emphasis on the need of modeling
the broadening of bands with a negligible natural width
in order to reproduce the observed loss spectrum. In a
harmonic model this broadening is not necessary since
the equidistant energy spectrum guarantees that a sin-
gle transition energy characterizes the excitation process.
We think that most of the broadening in our speciﬁc ex-
periment is due to the fact that the actual trapping po-
tential is not one-dimensional, and also to possible ﬂuc-
tuations and inhomogeneities of the lattice.

To conclude, we note that the dynamical analysis we
have made can be easily extended to lattices with larger
dimensionality, and also to other potentials, such as
Gaussian potentials, which are also commonly used for
optical trapping.

Inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on cold collisions of polar molecules

Christopher Ticknor and John L. Bohn
JILA, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309
(Dated: February 2, 2008)
We consider cold collisions of OH molecules in the 2Π3/2 grounds state, under the inﬂunce of a
magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that modest ﬁelds of several thousand gauss can act to suppress inelastic
collisions of weak-ﬁeld seeking states by two orders of magnitude. We attribute this suppression to
two factors: (i) An indirect coupling of the entrance and the exit channel, in contrast to the eﬀect of
an applied electric ﬁeld; and (ii) the realtive motion of the entrance and exit scattering thresholds.
In view of these results, magnetic trapping of OH may prove feasible.

INTRODUCTION

As the experimental reality of trapping ultra-cold polar
molecules approaches, a clear understanding is needed of
how the molecules interact in the trap environment. On
the most straightforward level, collisions are essential for
cooling the gas by either evaporative or sympathetic cool-
ing methods. A high rate of elastic collisions is desirable,
while a low rate of exothermic, state-changing collisions is
essential if the cold gas is to survive at all. Furthermore,
a clear understanding of 2-body interactions allows one
to construct a realistic model of the many body physics
in this dilute system [1].

One promising

trapping ultracold
strategy for
molecules might be to follow up on successes in trapping
of cold atoms, and to construct electrostatic [2, 3] or mag-
neto static [4] traps that can hold molecules in a weak-
ﬁeld-seeking state. Cold collisions of polar molecules in
this environment have been analyzed in the past, ﬁnd-
ing that inelastic collision rates were unacceptably high
in the presence of the electric ﬁeld, limiting the possi-
bilities for stable trapping [5]. Ref.
[5] found that the
large inelastic rates were due to the strong dipole-dipole
interaction coupling between the molecules. One impor-
tant feature of the dipole-dipole interaction is its com-
paratively long range. Even without knowing the details
of the short-ranged molecule-molecule interactions, the
dipole forces alone were suﬃcient to change the inter-
nal molecular states.
Indeed, a signiﬁcant ﬁnding was
that for weak-ﬁeld seekers, the molecules are prevented
from approaching close to one another due to a set of
long-range avoided crossings. Therefore, a reasonably ac-
curate description of molecular scattering may be made
using the dipolar forces alone [6].

A complimentary set of theoretical analyses have con-
sidered the problem of collisional stability of paramag-
netic molecules in a magnetostatic trap. For example,
the weak-ﬁeld-seeking states of molecules are expected
to survive collisions with He buﬀer gas atoms quite well
[7, 8]. Collisions of molecules with each other are also ex-
pected to preserve their spin orientation fairly well, and
hence remain trapped [9]. However, this eﬀect is miti-
gated in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [10, 11].

So far, no one appears to have considered the inﬂu-

ence of magnetic ﬁelds on cold molecule-molecule colli-
sions where both species have electric dipole moments.
In this paper we approach this subject, by considering
cold OH(2Π3/2)-OH(2Π3/2) collisions in a magnetic ﬁeld.
To the extent that the applied electric ﬁeld is zero, one
might expect that dipole forces average to zero and thus
do not contribute to de-stabilizing the spin orientation.
It turns out that this is not quite correct, and that dipole-
dipole forces still dominate long-range scattering. How-
ever, applying a suitably strong magnetic ﬁeld turns out
to mitigate this eﬀect signiﬁcantly.
Interestingly, even
in this case the residual second-order dipole interactions
are suﬃciently strong to restrict scattering to large inter-
molecular separation

The main result of the paper is summarized in Figure
1, which contrasts the inﬂuence of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. Figure 1(a) plots the elastic (solid curves) and
inelastic (dashed curves) collision rate constants for OH
, weak-ﬁeld-seeking
=
molecules in their
hyperﬁne state (for details on quantum numbes, see be-
low). As the electric ﬁeld is increased, the elastic rate
constant grows to alarmingly large values, making the
gas collisionally unstable, as was shown in Ref. [5]. Fig-
ure 1(b), which is new to this paper, shows the analogous
rate constants in a magnetic ﬁeld (in both cases the ﬁeld
is assumed to lie along the positive z axis of the labora-
tory reference frame). In this case the magnetic ﬁeld has
the eﬀect of suppressing collisions, all the way down to a
10−13 cm3/sec at ﬁelds of B = 3000
rate constant of 2
gauss. These results are moreover fairly robust against
raising the temperature to the merely cold (not ultracold)
1mK, attainable in buﬀer-gas loading
temperatures,
or Stark slowing experiments. This is good news for ex-
periments – it implies that cooling strategies that rely on
collisions may be feasible, provided a suitably large bias
magnetic ﬁeld is applied.

Our main goal here is to analyze the suppression of
rates in a magnetic ﬁeld. The organization is as follows.
First we review the relevant molecular structure, and es-
pecially the Stark and Zeeman eﬀects, to illustrate their
complementary natures. We then present an overview of
the scattering model, including a review of the dipole-
dipole interaction. Finally we present an analysis of the
system in a magnetic ﬁeld using a reduced channel model

immediate relevance to our project.

The rest of this paper will, fundamentally, restate this
fact in the context of scattering, and follow up the con-
sequences that arise from it. To set the context of this
discussion, and to ﬁx our notation, we ﬁrst consider the
molecules in the absence of external ﬁelds.

A. Molecular structure in zero external ﬁeld

The OH radical has a complicated ground state struc-
ture which includes rotation, parity, nuclear spin, elec-
tronic spin and orbital degrees of freedom. We assume
that the vibrational degrees of freedom are frozen out at
low temperatures, hence treat the molecules as rigid ro-
tors. We further assume that perturbations due to far
away rotational levels are weak. We do, however, include
perturbatively the inﬂuence of the Ω = 1/2 ﬁne structure
level, as described in Ref. [5].

The electronic ground state of OH is 2Π, with Ω = 3/2 .
OH is an almost pure Hund’s case (a) molecule, meaning
the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly coupled
to the intermolecular axis. The electronic state of the
molecule in the J basis is denoted by
where
J is the total electronic angular momentum, MJ is its
projection onto the lab axis and Ω is J’s projection onto
the molecular axis. Σ and Λ are the projection of the
electron’s spin and orbital angular momentum onto the
molecular axis, and their sum equals Ω (= Σ + Λ). The
electronic degrees of freedom,
, will be suppressed
i
for notational simplicity because they are constant for
all the collisional processes we consider.

MJ Ω is a Wigner D-function. It is necessary
for a Π state molecule to use the parity basis because OH
has a Λ-doublet splitting which separates the two parity
states (e/f ). The Λ-doublet arises from a coupling to a
near by Σ state. It is the coupling of the Σ state to Π
state of the same parity which breaks the degeneracy of
the two Π parity states [14].

that encapsulates the essential collision physics. Finally
the model is qualitatively understood using the adiabatic
representation.

II. ELECTRIC VERSUS MAGNETIC FIELDS
APPLIED TO MOLECULES

Both the Stark and Zeeman eﬀects in molecules have
a similar form, since both arise as the scalar product of
a dipole moment with an external ﬁeld. Their inﬂuence
on the molecule is quite diﬀerent, however, since they act
on fundamentally diﬀerent degrees of freedom. The elec-
tric ﬁeld is concerned primarily with where the charges
are in the molecule, whereas the magnetic ﬁeld is con-
cerned with where they are going. This is of paramount
importance, since it implies that the electric ﬁeld is a
true vector (odd under the parity operation), whereas
the magnetic ﬁeld is a pseudovector (even under parity)
[12]. An electric ﬁeld will therefore mix parity states of
a molecule, while a magnetic ﬁeld will mix states only
of a given parity. This distinction is explored further in
[13]; here we will only focus on those aspects of

the hyperﬁne quantum number of one or both of the scat-
tering molecules. The hyperﬁne structure arises from
interaction of the electronic spin with the nuclear spin
(I) which must then be included in the molecular basis
set. In the hyperﬁne basis the OH states are

B. Stark Eﬀect in OH

As noted above, the distinguishing feature of the Stark
eﬀect is that it mixes molecular states of opposite par-
ity separated by the Λ doublet splitting. A consequence
of this is that the Stark energies vary quadratically with
electric ﬁeld at low ﬁelds, and linearly only at higher
ﬁelds. The ﬁeld where this transition occurs is given
~E to the Λ dou-
roughly by equating the ﬁeld’s eﬀect ~µE ·
blet splitting (here ~µE is the molecule’s electric dipole
moment, and ~E is the ﬁeld. In OH, this ﬁeld is approxi-

Figure 2 shows the energy levels of OH in the presence
of an electric ﬁeld. Both parity states are shown, la-
beled e and f . An essential point of Fig. 2 is that the e
and f states repel as the electric ﬁeld in increased. This
means the all of the f (e) states increase (decrease) in
energy as the ﬁeld in increased, implying that states of
the same parity stay close together in energy as the ﬁeld
is increased. This fact has a crucial eﬀect on the inelastic
scattering as we will show.

state whose cold collisions we are most interested in, be-
cause i) it is weak-ﬁeld seeking, and ii) its collisions at
low temperature result almost entirely from long-range
dipole-dipole interactions [5]. Molecules in this state will
suﬀer inelastic collisions to all of the other internal states
shown. The rate constant shown in Figure 1 is the sum
of all rate constants for all such processes.

C. Zeeman Eﬀect in OH

When OH is in an external magnetic ﬁeld the elec-
tron’s orbital motion and intrinsic magnetic dipole mo-
ment both interact with the ﬁeld. The interaction is de-
scribed by the Zeeman Hamiltonian which is

III. SCATTERING HAMILTONIAN

A complete potential energy surface for the interac-
tion of two OH molecules, including the relatively long-
range part most relevant to cold collisions, is at present
unavailable. Certain aspects of this surface have, how-
ever, been discussed [17]. For the time being, we will
follow our previous approach of focusing exclusively on
the dipole-dipole interaction. It appears that molecules
in the highest weak-ﬁeld-seeking states are mostly insen-
sitive to short-range eﬀects.

state of each molecule and the partial wave l describing
the relative orbital angular momentum of the molecules.
In a ﬁeld, of course, the hyperﬁne and parity quantum
numbers are no longer good. It is therefore essential to
consider a set of scattering channels “dressed” by the
appropriate ﬁeld. This is achieved by diagonalizing the
Stark or Zeeman Hamiltonian of each molecule, includ-
ing the Λ doubling and hyperﬁne structure. The result-
ing eigenvectors then comprise the molecular basis used
to construct the scattering Hamiltonian. Field dressing
is essential because otherwise non-physical couplings be-
tween channels presist to inﬁnite separation. The diago-
nal contributions of the Stark and Zeeman Hamiltonian
in the ﬁeld dressed basis deﬁne to the scattering thresh-
olds as R

The channels involved in a given scattering process are
further constrained by symmetries. Namely, scattering of
identical bosons restricts the basis set to even values of l

the opposite parity states repel and thus like parity state stay
close together in energy.

and spin contributions to the molecular magnetic mo-
ment nearly cancel, to within the deviation of ge/2 from
one. For the ¯Ω = 3/2 states of interest to us, however,
the magnetic moment remains large.

The key feature of the Zeeman matrix element (9) is
that it is diagonal in ǫ, in contrast to the Stark matrix
element. This trait persists in the hyperﬁne basis as well,
where the matrix elements are

consequence of this factor, matrix elements diagonal in
parity identically vanish in zero electric ﬁeld. Instead, for
example, two f -parity states only interact with one an-
other via coupling to a channel consisting of two e-parity
states.

This dependence on parity is perhaps not unexpected,
since the dipole-dipole force is of course transmitted by
the dipole moment of the ﬁrst molecule producing an
electric ﬁeld that acts on the second molecule. But in
a state of good parity, the ﬁrst molecule does not have
a dipole moment until it is acted upon by the second
molecule. Thus, both molecules must simultaneously mix
states of opposite parity to interact. Notice that in the
presence of an electric ﬁeld, the dipoles are already par-
tially polarized, and this restriction need not apply; the

scattering channels are already directly coupled. This
change is of decisive importance in elucidating the inﬂu-
ence of electric ﬁelds on collisions. In a magnetic ﬁeld, by
contrast, parity remains conserved and the interactions
are intrinsically weaker as a result.

IV.
INELASTIC RATES OF OH-OH
COLLISIONS IN EXTERNAL FIELDS

We move now to the consequences of the interaction
(15) on scattering. Scattering calculations are done us-
ing the log-derivative propagator method [19]. To ensure
convergence at all collision energies and applied ﬁelds,
it was necessary to include partial waves up to l = 6,
and to carry the propagation out to an intermolecular
distance of R = 104(a.u.) before matching to long-range

wave functions. Cross sections and rate constants are
computed in the standard way for anisotropic potentials
[20].

In the following, we will make frequent reference to
“energy gap suppression” of collision rates. This notion
arises from a perturbative view of inelastic collisions, in
which case the transition probability amplitude is pro-
portional to the overlap integral

where ψi,f denote the incident and ﬁnal channel radial
wave functions, and Vif is the coupling matrix element
between them. In our case, ψi will have a long de Broglie
wavelength corresponding to its essentially zero collision
energy. The de Broglie wavelength of ψf will instead

grow smaller as the energy gap Ei −
dent and ﬁnal thresholds grows. Thus the integral in
(16), and correspondingly the collision rates, will dimin-
ish. For this reason, the collisions we consider tend to
favor changing the hyperﬁne states of the molecules over
changing the parity states, since the hyperﬁne splitting
of OH is smaller than the Λ-doubling.

A. Electric Field Case

To calculate scattering in the presence of an electric
ﬁeld, we only need to include partial waves l = 0, 2 for
numerical accuracy of K inel
for the ﬁeld range that we
1000(V /cm), and at a collision energy of
consider, E
10−5 K. Here we are only interested in the trend and
identiﬁcation of the loss mechanism. To numerically con-
verge the inelastic rates at higher ﬁeld values, where the
induced dipoles are large, naturally requires more partial
waves.

Figure 4 (a) shows the total (black) and partial (color)
inelastic rate constant K inel
as a function of the electric
ﬁeld (compare Fig. 1 (a)). Even in zero ﬁeld, where the
dipolar forces nominally average out, the rate constant is
large, comparable to the elastic rate constant. This fact
attests to the strength of dipolar forces in OH, even in
second order.

The green line in Fig. 4(a) represents losses to the
dominant zero ﬁeld loss channel

This behavior arises from two competing tendencies in
an electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst is the increasing mixing of dif-

an increasing strength of the direct dipole-dipole coupling
that aﬀects both exit channels. This additional coupling
would, in general, cause inelastic rates to rise. It is, how-
ever, oﬀset by the competing tendency for inelastic rates
to become less likely when the change in relative kinetic
energy of the collision partners is larger. Fig. 4(b) shows
the threshold energies for the two exit channels in Fig.
4(a), versus ﬁeld, with zero representing the energy of
the incident threshold. Here it is evident that loss to

by a large gain in kinetic energy, whereas loss to chan-

B. Magnetic Field Case

To gain insight into the suppression of the inelastic
rates in a magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 5 (a)), calculations were
at a representative collision energy E = 10−5K. To con-
verge the calculations in high ﬁeld (B
1500 gauss) re-
quired partial waves l = 0, 2, 4, 6. We have only con-
sidered collisions with incident partial wave l = 0, since

3000 Gauss can reduce the inelastic rate constant to be-
10−13 cm3/sec, see Figure 1. The cause of this
low 2
decrease can be traced directly to the relative separation
of the incident and ﬁnal channel thresholds, along with
the indirect nature of the coupling.

To see this, we reduce the model to its essential in-
gredients: (1) a strong dipole-dipole interaction, (2) the
relative motion of the thresholds as the magnetic ﬁeld is
tuned, (3) an extremely exothermic intermediate channel
and (4) the centrifugal barrier in the ﬁnal and interme-
diate channels. The Hamiltonian for a reduced model is
HModel = T0 + VModel, where T0 is the kinetic energy
operator and VModel in matrix form is

The model Hamiltonian (17) explicitly excludes direct
coupling between incident and ﬁnal channels, whereas
coupling is mediated through the int channel. Parame-
ters characteristic of the physical problem are a = 0.12

to the intermediate channels are negligible. We ﬁnd, in
addition, that moving Eint has little eﬀect on the rate
constants for loss to channel f .

Because the electric ﬁeld remains zero, parity is still
a rigorously good quantum number. Therefore states
of the same parity are not directly coupled. Nev-

ﬁeld share the parity of the incident channel wave
function,

Since direct coupling to these ﬁnal channels is forbid-

through some intermediate channel
. Moreover, ow-

(15), this intermediate channel must have parity quan-
tum numbers ǫ1 = ǫ2 = +. Since this coupling is second
order, the dominant exit channels can consist of both
d-wave (lf = 2) and g-wave (lf = 4) contributions, in
contrast to the electric ﬁeld case.

The primary feature of the inelastic rates in Fig. 5
(a) is that they decrease signiﬁcantly at large ﬁeld. This
decline is the main reason for optimism regarding evap-
orative cooling strategies in OH; an applied bias ﬁeld of

8

as the states are separated in energy. In addition, the g-
wave rates decay more slowly as a function of ﬁeld than
do the d-wave rates, consistent with the full calculation
(compare Fig. 5). The declining values of the rate con-
stant cannot, however, be attributed to a simple overlap
integral of the form (16), since the incident and ﬁnal
channels are not directly coupled. We therefore present
a more reﬁned adiabatic analysis of this process in the
next subsection.

C. Adiabatic Analysis of the magnetic ﬁeld case

To understand the system’s magnetic ﬁeld behavior we
analyze the reduced channel model (17) in the adiabatic
representation [21, 22]. This representation assumes that
R is a “slow” coordinate. At every R we diagonalize the
Hamiltonian in all remaining degrees of freedom. Since it
is not rigorously true that R varies inﬁnitely slowly, the
residual nonadiabatic couplings can be accounted for in
the kinetic energy operator. Written more formally we
diagonalize

W =

values and
vectors we are able to form a linear transformation X(R)
which transforms between the diabatic and adiabatic rep-
resentations, ie X T W (R)X = U(R). The eigenvalues
and eigenvectors have radial dependence, but for nota-
tional simplicity (R) will be suppressed hereafter.

To distinguish between adiabatic and diabatic repre-
sentations we use Greek letters (α, β, ...) to denote the
adiabatic channels and Roman letters (i,j,...) to denote
diabatic channels. When considering speciﬁc inelastic
processes in the diabatic basis we denote initial and ﬁnal
channels as i and f and for the adiabatic channels as ι
and ϕ.
, the two sets of channels
coincide.

In the limit R

→ ∞

A partial set of adiabatic potential curves generated
in this way is shown in Fig. 7, exhibiting an avoided
crossing at R = 150. Thus molecules incident on the
uppermost channel scatter primarily at large values of R.
This point has been made in the past when an electric
ﬁeld is applied [5]; here we note that it is still true in
zero electric ﬁeld, and that scattering calculations can
proceed without reference to short-range dynamics.

The transformation between the representations is R
dependent implying that the channel couplings shift from
the potential to the kinetic energy operator. Using the

adiabatic representation changes Eq. 12 to

Scattering amplitudes are then easily estimated in
the adiabatic distorted-wave Born approximation (AD-

wave functions φι,ϕ that propagate according to the adi-
abatic potentials Uι,ϕ. In terms of these adiabatic wave-
functions, the scattering T -matrix is given by an overlap

The result of the ADWBA is shown in ﬁgure 8. The
p
two curves are for d (black) and g-wave (red) inelastic
channels. Several key features are present that also oc-
cur in the full calculation, namely: (1) the inelastic rate
goes down with increasing threshold separation. (2) there
is a zero in the rates as seen in Fig. 5 (3) the g-wave in-
elastic rate goes more slowly than the d-wave as seen in
the model and the full calculation. The ADWBA ac-
counts for all of these. The ﬁrst feature, diminishing
rates, still arises from an energy gap suppression, since
the de Broglie wavelengths of incident and ﬁnal channel
still do not match well. In the ADWBA this process is
further helped along by the fact that the residual channel
coupling, represented by P , is localized near the avoided
crossings of the adiabatic potential curves.

The ADWBA helps to visualize this suppression, as
shown by the sample wave functions in Fig. 9. This ﬁg-

dR ψϕ, and Pιϕ for various values of Ef .
Varying Ef mimics the threshold motion of the system.

the diﬀerent Ef s leave ψι mostly unchanged, however ψϕ
becomes more exothermic and therefore more oscillatory
(λdb clearly shortens). Moreover, the dominant coupling
region, where Pιϕ peaks, moves to shorter R as Ef in-
creases. This motion is obvious from the avoided crossing
in Fig. 7.

The transition amplitude in the ADWBA is propor-
tional to the integral of the product of the three quanti-
ties in Fig. 9. Because of the shortening of the de Broglie
wavelength in the exit channel, this integral will eventu-
ally vanish, accounting for the zero in the inelastic rates.
The total rate will, in general, not vanish, since there

are many exit channels, and they will experience the de-
structive interference at diﬀerent values of the threshold,
hence at diﬀerent ﬁelds.

Finally, the g-wave inelastic rates are not so strongly
aﬀected by the separation of Ei and Ef because the g-
wave centrifugal barrier is larger, meaning a greater en-
ergy is required to change the wave function at short
range such that velocity node can pass through the cou-
pling region. The zero in this rate constant will thus
occur at larger threshold separations.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have explored the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld
on the cold collision dynamics of polar molecules. The
dipole-dipole interactions remain signiﬁcant even in the
absence of an electric ﬁeld that polarizes the molecules.
In general this implies that molecular orientations are un-
stable in collisions, making magnetic trapping infeasible.
We have found, however, that a suitably strong magnetic
ﬁeld can mitigate this instability.

Beyond this result, we note that laboratory strength
ﬁelds can exert comparable inﬂuence on cold collisions, if
applied separately. A useful rule of thumb in this regard

is that an electric ﬁeld of 300 V /cm acting on a 1 Db
dipole moment caues roughly the same energy shift as a
100 gauss ﬁeld acting on a 1 Bohr magneton magnetic
moment. This raises the interesting question of how the
two ﬁelds can be applied simultaneously, to exert even
ﬁner control over collision dynamics. This will be the
subject of future investigations.

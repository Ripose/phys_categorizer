A concept of CP-violating (T,P-odd) permanent molecular magnetic moments µCP is introduced.
We relate the moments to the electric dipole moment of electron (eEDM) and estimate µCP for
several diamagnetic polar molecules. The moments exhibit a steep, Z5, scaling with the nuclear
charge Z of the heavier molecular constituent. A measurement of the CP-violating magnetization
of a polarized sample of heavy molecules may improve the present limit on eEDM by several orders
of magnitude.

It is a common knowledge, that heteronuclear diatomic
molecules possess a static electric dipole moment aligned
with the internuclear axis ˆn, D = D ˆn. For a dia-
magnetic molecule, however, there is no similar mag-
netic moment. As demonstrated below, an existence
of such a magnetic moment would violate both parity-
transformation (P) and time-reversal (T) discrete sym-
metries. Because of the compelling CPT theorem, an
observation of this magnetic moment would provide an
evidence for the CP violation [1, 2]. CP-violation, al-
though observed in particle physics, still remains a mys-
tery, as much stronger CP-violating mechanisms may be
required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of
the Universe.

Here we introduce the molecular CP-violating mag-
netic moments, µCP = µCP ˆn. We propose a mea-
surement of µCP via detection of ultra-weak magnetic
ﬁelds generated by a polarized sample of diamagnetic
molecules. For several molecules we evaluate µCP and
express them in terms of the permanent electric dipole
moment (EDM) of electron, de. A measurement of non-
vanishing molecular CP-violating moments would reveal
the elusive electron EDM (eEDM) (EDMs violate both
T and P symmetries). While no EDMs have been found
so far, it is anticipated that the next generation of ex-
periments may ﬁnally discover the EDMs. Indeed, most
supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model of ele-
mentary particles predict eEDMs that are within a reach
of planned and on-going experimental searches (see, e.g.,
a popular review [3]). The present limit on de comes from
an atomic Tl beam experiment [4],

de (Tl) < 1.6

Here we propose an experimental search for the CP-
violating magnetic moments of heavy polar molecules.
We argue that the limit on µCP derived from such ex-
periments would imply constraints on de that are several
orders of magnitude better than the present limit (1). In
principle, the experiments can be carried out with any
diamagnetic polar molecules. However, there is no par-
ticular advantage in using polyatomics, and we restrict
our consideration to polar diatomic molecules.

In the remainder of this paper, unless speciﬁed oth-
erwise, we use atomic units

e

Gaussian system for electro-magnetic equations. In these
units, the Bohr magneton is µB = α/2, where α

ﬁeld is me2e5/¯h4

where Λ = (L

ond term in (2) is T,P-even, the µCP ˆn term violates both
time-reversal (and thus CP) and parity. Indeed, under
the time reversal the magnetic moment acquires a mi-
nus sign, while ˆn is T-invariant. Similarly, under parity
transformation, µ is not aﬀected, while ˆn ﬂips direction.

Here we consider eEDM as a source of CP-violation, so

Eint
exerted upon the EDM is the strongest at the nucleus,
leading to E int ≈
(Z/r2) ˆr, where Z is the nuclear charge
and r is the radius-vector of the electron with respect to
the nucleus. The matrix element of V CP scales as Z 3, so
that the interaction V CP can be considered as localized at
the heavier nucleus. Below we will evaluate the molecular
sum (3) using an approach similar to the LCAO method
(linear combination of atomic orbitals).

Note that Eq. (3) is expressed in the body-frame of the
molecule. After µCP is found one has to average Eq. (2)
= 0 and
over rotations. In the external electric ﬁeld
we get magnetization in the direction of the electric ﬁeld.
The second T,P-even term in Eq. (2) does not contribute
to this magnetization. For diamagnetic molecules (J
·
ˆn) = Ω = 0 and this term vanishes. For paramagnetic
molecules in the absence of the magnetic the levels with
diﬀerent signs of Ω are equally populated and this term
is averaged to zero.

We would like to detect a magnetization of a sample
of polarized molecules due to CP-violating magnetic mo-
ments. In this regard, it is beneﬁcial to work with dia-
magnetic molecules Ω = 0, so that the traditional T,P-
conserving magnetic moment (the last term in Eq. (2))
does not contribute to the magnetization. Some of the
molecules may still have non-zero nuclear magnetic mo-
ments. However, the magnetization due to the nuclear
moments in a macroscopic sample will average out to
zero, since the nuclear spins have equal probabilities
of orienting parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of
internuclear axis. Another advantage of diamagnetic
molecules is that they are also chemically stable allowing
for higher sample densities and thus for a larger sample
magnetization.

To illustrate our qualitative approach to evaluat-
ing CP-violating magnetic moments, consider a polar
molecule CsF in its ground 1Σ state. Halides exhibit a
chemical bond of a strong ionic character, and we model
the CsF molecule as the Cs+ ion perturbed by the elec-
of negative ion F−. The perturbing ﬁeld at
tric ﬁeld

the Cs+ is
e, where Re is the internuclear sepa-
ration and q = 1 is the valency of Cs. The CP-violation
is enhanced near the heavier atom and we may evaluate
the magnetic moment as

where βCP(Cs+) is a so-called CP-violating polarizabil-

erty — CP-violating polarizability of the heavier con-
stituent. If both constituents of the diatomic molecule

CP-violating polarizabilities.

The eﬀect of CP-
violation on electromagnetic properties of the media
has been considered by a number of authors (see, e.g.,
[6, 8, 9, 10]). In particular, the atomic CP-violating (T,P-
odd) polarizability βCP relates induced atomic magnetic
moment µCPat to the externally applied electric ﬁeld

For a spherically-symmetric system, the CP-odd polar-
izability is a scalar quantity, i.e., the induced magnetic
moment is directed along the applied E-ﬁeld.

In Ref. [7] we have computed and explored the atomic
CP-violating polarizabilities for rare-gas atoms in their
respective 1S0 ground states. Since the calculation re-
ported here builds upon that work, let us brieﬂy reca-
pitulate our approach and main results. We related βCP
to the eEDM through third-order perturbation theory:
the CP-odd polarizability of an atomic state Φ0 can be
represented as

In Ref. [7], we demonstrated that βCP has a doubly rel-
ativistic origin: relativistic eﬀects are essential for non-
vanishing matrix elements of V CP (Schiﬀ theorem) and
also due to peculiar properties of magnetic-dipole opera-
tor M . This doubly relativistic nature leads to a steep,
Z 5R(Z), scaling of βCP with the nuclear charge, where
slowly-varying R(Z) is a relativistic enhancement factor
(see Ref. [7] for details). This result, together with the
estimate (4), immediately provides us with the Z-scaling
of the CP-violating magnetic moments of diamagnetic
molecules

µCP

Z 5R(Z) ,

∝

where Z is the nuclear charge of the heavier constituent.
This Z-scaling is more substantial than the usual Z 3R(Z)
scaling [12] of the eﬀects of eEDM on the energy levels
of paramagnetic molecules (radicals). As in the tradi-
tional EDM searches, it is beneﬁcial to search for non-
vanishing CP-odd magnetic moments with molecules in-
volving heavy atoms. Diamagnetic contribution (6) to
CP-odd polarizability is universal. However, for the sys-
tems with unpaired electrons this contribution is masked
by a larger paramagnetic term which is linked to the
electronic angular momentum [8]. The advantage of the
diamagnetic systems is the much lower magnetic noise,
which may be crucial for the experiment. On the theo-
retical side, calculation of µCP for diamagnetic molecules
may be simpler and more reliable than for para- or fer-
romagnetic crystals.

Results of calculations. In Table I we present the re-
sults of our calculations of CP-violating magnetic mo-
ments for several diatomics: CsF, BaO, TlF, PbO, and
BiF. These diamagnetic molecules possess the 1Σ ground
state. The heavier atoms of these diatomic pairs are met-
als, and we assume that the molecules exhibit a pure case
of ionic bond, i.e., these heavier atoms fully lend their
valence electrons to their electronegative companions (F
and O) and become closed-shelled 1S0 ions. The second
and third columns of the Table list the resulting heavy

atomic ions with their nuclear charges, and in the fourth
column we present our computed values of CP-violating
polarizabilities of these ions. Finally, we combine ionic
βCP with the equilibrium internuclear separations (see
Eq.(4)) and obtain an estimate for the molecular CP-
violating magnetic moments. Our sign convention in ex-
pression µCP = µCP ˆn is such that the unit vector ˆn is
directed from the heavier to the lighter nucleus. Notice
that we express the µCP in terms of eEDM. Similarly,
µCP can be expressed in terms of the T,P-odd electron-
nucleon couplings; a simple prescription of how to relate
the present results to the strength of such couplings is
given in Ref. [7].

molecules. The values of µCP/de are dimensionless, de and
µCP being expressed in the Gaussian atomic units. The sec-
ond, third, and the fourth columns list the heavier ion in the
molecule, its nuclear charge and its CP-violating polarizabil-
ity, βCP/de, in units of ¯h4/(me2e5). Notation x[y] stands for
x × 10y.

For all the considered molecules, the internuclear sepa-
2˚A, and thus the internal molecular ﬁelds are
ration Re ≈
comparable. More signiﬁcant is the eﬀect of increasing
CP-violating polarizabilities (the fourth column of Ta-
ble I) as one progresses to heavier elements. This trend
is largely due to the Z 5 scaling of βCP. Yet, there is an
order of magnitude of diﬀerence between βCP for Pb++
(Z = 82) and Bi+ (Z = 83). A part of this large enhance-
ment lies in a softer excitation spectrum of Bi+ and thus
smaller energy denominators in Eq. (6). Also, while solv-
ing the DHF equations we assumed that the outer shell
of Bi+ ion has the 6p2
1/2 electronic conﬁguration. In gen-
eral, however, the ground state of Bi+ would contain a
combination of 6p2
3/2 conﬁgurations. Since the
p1/2 states couple to EDM strongly, while p3/2 orbitals
contribute at a much smaller level, we expect that our
result for βCP of Bi+ is somewhat overestimated.

Results of Table I should be considered as a qualitative
estimate for another reason as well. The expressions (4)
and (6) are based on atomic wavefunctions
, instead
of the molecular wavefunctions of the deﬁning expres-
sion (3). An underlying assumption is that the molecular
wavefunctions
in the vicinity of the heavier atomic ion

calculations of CP-violating magnetic moments are desir-
able to depart from this simple perturbative picture. To
motivate more sophisticated calculations, let us evalu-
ate a feasibility of an experimental determination of µCP
based on our qualitative estimates.

Proposed experiments. The molecular CP-odd mag-
netic moments are tiny. For example, combining the
present limit on the eEDM (1) with the computed value
of µCP/de, we obtain for BiF,

µCP(BiF) < 2.4

10−37erg/Gauss .

While this is a remarkably small value, only 2.6
of the electron magnetic moment, measuring such small
magnetic moments seems to be possible with the modern
magnetometry.

The CP-violating magnetic moments can be deter-
mined by measuring the ultraweak magnetic ﬁeld gen-
erated by a sample of molecules. Because of rotations,
the body-ﬁxed µCP moment averages to zero in the lab-
oratory frame. Experimentally, one needs to apply a po-
Epol to orient the molecules along
larizing electric ﬁeld
the ﬁeld. For the eﬃcient polarization, the coupling to
the ﬁeld must be stronger than the rotational spacing,
D
Epol > 2B, where B is the rotational constant. For the
ground vibrational state of BiF, the rotational constant is
0.231 cm−1, requiring the application of the polariz-
B
ing E-ﬁeld of a few kV/cm. Another consideration comes
from thermal averaging over rotational levels [13], and it
is beneﬁcial to work at very low temperatures to have the
smallest possible number of populated rotational levels.
Suppose we have a spherical cell with polarized dia-
magnetic molecules; the permanent CP-violating mag-
netic moments of the molecules produce a macroscopic
magnetization of the sample generating an ultraweak
magnetic ﬁeld. The maximum value of the magnetic ﬁeld
at the surface of the cell can be expressed as

where n is the number density of the sample. One could
measure this induced magnetic ﬁeld and set the limits on
the eEDM or other CP-violating mechanisms. Clearly,
one should increase the number density to enhance the
signal. However, condensing polar molecules with ionic
bonds leads to a crystallization of the sample. To main-
tain the individuality of the molecules, one could em-
ploy low-temperature matrices of rare-gas atoms with
molecules embedded inside the matrix [14]. The ma-
trix isolation is a well established technique in chemical
physics. For chemically stable molecules, the number of
guest molecules per host atom (matrix ratio), could be as
high as 1/10 [15], i.e., with the techniques of matrix isola-
tion, one could attain the number densities of molecules
in the order of 1021 cm−3.

With the sample number density of 1021 cm−3 and
µCP of BiF (7) derived from the present limit on eEDM,
from Eq.(8) we obtain a generated B-ﬁeld of

within a month of integration time at the present best

periment. The projected theoretical limit [16] of this
method is 10−13 G/√Hz. More optimistic projected sen-
10−15 G/√Hz is given in Ref. [17]. With
sitivity of 3
this projected sensitivity, we ﬁnd that the present limit
on the eEDM (1) may be improved by three orders of
magnitude,

In Ref. [7], we have considered a CP-odd magnetiza-

magnetization due to molecular CP-odd magnetic mo-
ments and we ﬁnd that the BiF experiment has a sub-

ratory ﬁeld and the internal molecular ﬁeld [18] is ex-
ploited in more conventional searches for EDMs with
molecules [19, 20, 21, 22]. It is worth emphasizing that
the experiment considered here is based on a bulk mag-
netization of diamagnetic molecules, while the conven-
tional searches for eEDM determine energy splittings in
individual paramagnetic molecules.

To summarize, we introduced a concept of molecular
CP-violating (T,P-odd) magnetic moments, µCP. We
related these magnetic moments to eEDM and we esti-
mated µCP for a number of diamagnetic polar molecules.
We demonstrated that µCP exhibit a strong Z 5 depen-
dence on the nuclear charge of the heavier molecular con-
stituent. Finally, we evaluated a feasibility of setting a
limit on the eEDM by measuring ultra-weak magnetic
ﬁelds produced by a polarized sample of diamagnetic
molecules. We found that such an experiment may im-
prove the present limit on the eEDM by several orders of
magnitude.

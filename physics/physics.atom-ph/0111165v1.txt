The existence of a ﬁnite electric dipole moment (EDM) da of the closed-shell atom Yb implies
parity and time reversal violations involving the nuclear sector. An important eﬀect which can
contribute to the Yb EDM is the tensor-pseudotensor electron-nucleus interaction characterized by
the coupling constant CT . Within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics CT = 0, as this form
of interaction is not allowed. If a ﬁnite da of Yb is observed in experiments, then an estimate of
CT can be obtained by combining with the theoretical calculations. A non-zero CT implies physics
beyond the standard model. In this paper we present the result of our ab initio calculation of the
EDM Yb using diﬀerent many-body methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

Discrete symmetry violations in atoms are important phenomena to probe for physics beyond the Standard
Model(SM) of the particle physics. The electric dipole moment(EDM) of an atom, which is a signature of the
simultaneous parity and time-reversal (P-T) symmetry violations is one such. There are several possible sources of
P-T violation eﬀects within an atom, the tensor pseudo-tensor electron nucleus interaction is an example which is
semi-leptonic in nature. The atomic Yb, which is a closed-shell atom having a Z = 70 is a very good candidate for
atomic EDM experiments to probe for the nuclear sector eﬀects. An additional advantage of using a rare Earth atom
like Yb is the closely spaced energy levels. The experimental results when compared with the theoretical results can
yield signatures of physics beyond the SM.

Among the closed-shell atoms, the atom EDM of Xe [1] and Hg [2] have been measured. Though the Hg experiment
has set the record of being the most sensitive spectroscopy ever done, the result obtained is null and sets an upper
10−28ecm. Still, it has set bounds on the parameters in particle physics models [2].
bound to atomic Hg EDM as 2.1
Improving the accuracy further is an important challenge in atomic EDM experiments. Atomic Yb oﬀer a possibility
of achieving this by using the techniques of laser cooling and trapping. It is also desirable that the EDM measurements
be done in other closed-shell atoms to verify the physical eﬀects observed.

×

Atomic Yb also has the advantage of being relatively simple in level structure among the rare Earth elements. It has
been studied theoretically using a variety of atomic many-body methods and there are ongoing experimental studies.
The excitation energies has been studied using relativistic coupled-cluster method [3]; the hyperﬁne structure constants
and electric-dipole transition properties have been studied using multireference relativistic many-body perturbation
theory [4,5]; and the oscillator strength of some of the important transitions were investigated using multi-conﬁguration
relativistic Hartree-Fock [6]. The lifetime of some of the crucial levels have been measured experimentally [7] and
atomic Yb has been laser cooled and trapped [8,9]. It is the candidate for the atomic EDM experiments using the
methods of laser cooling and trapping of atoms which are in progress [10,11].

The P-T violating eﬀects which can be probed using atomic Yb are the tensor pseudotensor (T-PT) electron-nucleus
interaction [12] and the Schiﬀ moment [13]. An observation of a ﬁnite EDM of atomic Yb could mean nonzero CT ,
which is a signature of physics beyond the SM as CT is zero within SM. Hence the theories which allow T-PT electron-
nucleus interactions would play a role in understanding nature. The parameter CT is extracted from the experimental
result of atomic EDM by combining with the theoretical calculations. Accurate atomic theory calculations are needed
to obtain precise CT .The atomic EDM can also put bounds on the parameters of alternative models in particle physics.

The Schiﬀ moment which arises due to either nucleon EDM or P-T violating interactions between the nucleons can also
contribute to the Yb EDM and can be used to extract the nuclear P-T violation parameters. We have calculated the
contribution to atomic Yb EDM from both these eﬀects but in this paper we will present the result of our calculations
for T-PT contribution alone, in a later paper we will present the result of our Schiﬀ moment Computation.

The calculation of Yb EDM within a limited set of conﬁguration state functions (CSFs) using diagonalization and
Bloch equation based many-body perturbation theory ( MBPT) methods was reported in an earlier paper [14]. For
convenient of reference this paper is called as paper-I hereafter. As a followup, in this paper we present results of
calculations using much larger CSF space. In addition, we discuss the drawbacks common to the diagonalization
and Bloch equation based perturbation methods, improvements are discussed and results of using these methods are
presented. In this paper we present the method of the calculation.

II. BLOCH EQUATION BASED MANY-BODY PERTURBATION THEORY

This section is a brief overview of the interaction used in the calculation and Bloch equation based MBPT. A
detailed description of which are given in the paper-I. The eﬀective T-PT electron-nucleus interaction Hamiltonian
obtained by treating the nucleus nonrelativistically is

HPTV = i2√2

where CT is the T-PT electron-nucleus coupling constant, GF is the Fermi coupling constant, ~I is the nuclear spin, β
and α are the Dirac matrices and ρN (r) is the nuclear density. This interaction Hamiltonian is eﬀective only within
the nuclear region, where ρN (r) is non-zero. And the dependence on ~I implies that it is observable only in odd
isotopes of Yb which has nonzero ~I. We use Fermi nuclear density model for our calculations.

The Bloch equation of an atom with unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 and the residual coulomb interaction Ves as the

perturbation is

III. SIZE CONSISTENT THEORY IN CLOSED-SHELL SYSTEMS

An atomic many-body theory is size consistent if the properties calculated using it scales linearly as the number of
the electrons. The diagonalization and the Bloch equation based methods are size consistent within a complete CSF
space. But it is size inconsistent if the conﬁguration space considered is incomplete. A consequence of incomplete
cancellation of the unlinked terms, which scales nonlinearly to the number of electrons. The cancellation is complete
when the CSF space is complete. To study atomic EDM which has important implications and small in magnitude
it is preferable to use atomic-many body theory which is size-consistent even with an incomplete CSF space. It is
also diﬃcult to satisfy the condition of completeness for heavy atoms, which are important candidates for the atomic
EDM experiments as the number of possible CSFs runs into millions for a moderate size orbital space.

A. Size Consistency with Linked Diagram Theorem

The wave-operator calculated using the Bloch equation within an incomplete CSF space is size-consistent if only

the linked terms are retained [16]. The incomplete cancellation of the unlinked terms is then avoided

IV. ANALYSIS OF THE CLUSTER EQUATIONS

The cluster based formalism is not an order by order formalism but an iterative scheme where the Bloch equation
is deﬁned in orders of excitations rather than the orders of perturbation. It is possible to separate the contributions
from various many-body eﬀects cleanly using Moller-Plesset partitioning and an added advantage is the one-to-one
correspondence with the diagrams using Goldstone evaluation rules. Such an approach has been used [20] to calculate
parity non-conservation in atomic cesium to very high accuracy. The E-N partitioning mixes the contributions, but
it has the advantage of capturing the static correlation eﬀects very eﬀectively. The CEPA-0 equations are exactly the
linearized singles and doubles coupled cluster equations, the CEPA-2 equations includes a class of non-linear terms.

A. The Singly Excited Amplitude Cluster Equation

The diagrammatic representation of the principal terms in (3.18) are shown in Fig.4. The contribution from each

of the diagrams are as described:

1. Diagram (a) contributes to the ﬁrst term

of the cluster equation and is independent of any cluster

2. The diagrams (b),(c),(d),(e) and (f) contribute to the second term

amplitudes. It is an important term as the iteration proceeds from this term.

Consider the diagrams (c) and (e), though they resemble the Hartree-Fock potential scattering diagram these are
very diﬀerent. Consider the the bubble part of the diagram (c), it is summed over the occupied orbitals common to
both the initial and the ﬁnal CSFs in the matrix element of Ves. An example in Yb is if the initial and ﬁnal CSFs
respectively, the bubble part in (c) has all the occupied orbitals except the 6s
are
orbital. This is because both the CSFs do not have 6s, where as in the Hartree-Fock scattering diagram the bubble
should have contribution from all the occupied orbitals. A similar description is true of diagrams (d) and (f) too.

C. Selection of EPV Terms and Connected Terms

The terms linear in cluster amplitude cannot violate Pauli exclusion principal. It is possible only when there are
CSFs which are EPV, which is not possible. The EPV diagrams arise from renormalization terms, which are non-
linear in cluster amplitude . The diagrams representing the renormalization terms are the cluster diagrams multiplied
by the energy diagrams and hence unlinked but these can suitably be rearranged to yield connected diagrams.

N

To select the EPV terms all the orbitals are tagged with labels which are prime numbers. The CSFs are also
assigned a number which is the product of the prime numbers corresponding to the labels of the holes and particles
, the prime numbers na, nb, nrand ns be the labels of the hole and
of the CSFs. Consider a doubly excited CSF
rs
ab their product, these ﬁve numbers identify the CSF. However, only three if the CSF is singly
particle states and
excited. To maintain consistency the remaining two indices are ﬁlled with another prime number not used in labeling
the orbitals, let this number be NP but set the corresponding multiplying factor in n as unity. According to this
scheme, the ground/reference state of Yb is identiﬁed by NP , Np, Np, Npand1. Similarly, labels are also given to the
cluster amplitudes.

Φrs

The terms to retain from (

r
a W )EPV are those having CSFs in W identiﬁed by
T

which can be divided by one
. The number of possible division is the
or more of the numbers identifying hole(particle) of the cluster amplitude
and W . During the selection process division by Np should be
number of common hole/particle lines between
discarded as this does not represent any hole of particle states and this is automatically achieved as the corresponding
multiplying factor in n is unity. The advantage of this scheme is that it reduces the number of operations required in
the selection process.

V. THE CONFIGURATION SPACE CONSIDERED

The conﬁguration space is spanned by the CSFs constructed from the V N−1 orbitals. The CSFs are generated by
single or double excitations from the occupied orbitals to the bound and the continuum virtual orbitals in all possible
ways such that it yields the required ﬁnal angular momentum. For the single reference MBPT, the reference CSF
of Yb is
∗
and 4f respectively. The CSF space generated is not a complete active space but complete for the single and double
excitations from the most important outer occupied orbitals within the orbital orbital space. The occupied-orbital
shells of the conﬁgurations that has been considered are

The remaining electrons are distrubuted among the virtual orbitals in all possible ways. From all the CSFs only the
J = 0 even parity and J = 1 odd parity CSFs are chosen. The number of non-relativistic CSFs generated are given in
TableI. Although not included in the table, CSFs with excitations from 5s are also included in the CSF space.

The total number of odd and even parity CSFs with bound virtual orbitals are 9930 and 17087 respectively. The
modulus of the EN-partitioned energies of the CSFs–the diagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements–are as shown in the

Number of odd parity CSFs in the intermediate energy is more than the even parity as the odd parity conﬁguration
space can have many possible intermediate couplings to give J = 1, to limit the number of CSFs within the memory
limitations a selection of CSFs is done. The double excitations to d and f symmetries above the energy of the
converged orbitals are not included. Another constraint on the choice of conﬁgurations is: there shouldn’t be more
than four open shells in the non-relativistic notation and eight in the relativistic form, choosing only singly and doubly
excited conﬁgurations satisﬁes this condition for a closed-shell atom like Yb. This constraint is due to the angular
co-eﬃcient computation program.

The atomic Yb EDM is calculated using the Bloch equation based MBPT and the size-consistent CEPA equations.
As a part of the calculation the ground state energy is also computed. The results with diﬀerent methods are given
in the following sections.

An important quantity that can be extracted from TableII is the change in E0. Deﬁne the correlation energy ∆E0
as the energy diﬀerence between the CSF energy of
and the energy calculated using the CSFs in the even-parity
CSF space. From the plot of ∆E0 in Fig7a it is evident that the change in the ground state ASF energy is not
uniform but in steps interrupted by regions of very minimal changes. Most signiﬁcant changes of ∆E0 occur while
increasing the CSFs from 100 to 500, from 1000 to 2000 and from 6435 to 7435 CSFs respectively. These changes
are not the combined eﬀect of all the CSFs added but due to a few important ones. The largest change of ∆E0 is

The Fig.8 shows the trend of wave-operator convergence. The ﬁrst graph Fig.8a is the value of the convergence
criteria plotted against the order of perturbation and second graph Fig.8b is log10 of the convergence criteria plotted
against the order of perturbation. From the ﬁrst graph it is evident that the convergence criteria begins with a small
value but as shown in the second graph in terms of order of magnitude, the convergence is not so fast. The convergence
is monotonic with very regular ﬂuctuations. The wave-operator Ωes is stored in an order by order sequence. These
are accessed as and when required during the calculation of Ωes,edm.

2. Calculation of Ωes,edm and da

The wave-operator Ωes,edm is calculated introducing the interaction Hamiltonian HPTV and adding opposite parity
CSFs to the CSF space. Once HPTV is applied to the wave-operator Ωes, it maps onto the odd-parity component of
the CSF space and can never be mapped back to the even-parity space as HPTV is treated to ﬁrst order only. This
is followed by a sequence of residual coulomb interaction Ves, which accounts for the correlation eﬀects within the
odd-parity sub-space. In sum total it is a sequence of perturbations applied to the ground state CSF
, where
i
HPTV is sandwiched between all possible arrangements of Ves. After the wave-operator Ωes.edm is calculated, the mixed
parity ground state wave-function

can be written in terms of the wave-operators Ωes and Ωes,edm as

The value of da is calculated using diﬀerent sets of CSFs, where the number of either the even or odd CSFs are ﬁxed
to the maximum allowed and then increase the number of CSFs in the opposite parity CSF space. The results of such
a sequence of calculations is given in the Table III. If the previous sequence of calculation shows the importance of
occupied orbitals in the whole CSF space, these two sequences demonstrates the signiﬁcance of the occupied orbitals
in CSF sub-space of each parity.

Like the correlation energy ∆E0 there is a signiﬁcant change of da when CSFs with double excitations from 6s are
included. To appreciate the change better the values of da in the two sequence are plotted in Fig.8. Consider the
sequence where the number of even-parity CSFs is ﬁxed, da increase with the number of the odd-parity CSFs, which
implies that there are no appreciable cancellations due to the odd parity CSFs added. In the second sequence where
the number of odd-parity CSFs is ﬁxed, da decreases as the number of even-parity CSFs is increased.

In both the sequence there is a signiﬁcant change in da when CSFs with double excitation from 6s orbital are added.
But, the changes are diﬀerent in sign, in the even CSF space the inclusion of CSFs with double excitation from 6s
increases the value of da where as in the odd-parity CSFs it decreases. Consider the expression for EDM it can be
expanded as

Within the whole CSF space considered the value of da is 4.4438 58.

In absolute terms this is 0.4804 56 less
compared to the lowest order result of 4.9243 136 calculated in an earlier section. A major contribution to this
diﬀerence is the many-body eﬀects, this is because the direct contributions from the CSFs added to the conﬁguration
space is small. Which implies that the contribution from the many-body eﬀects is just 10.81% of the total value
and the change is negative. An added advantage of the order by order approach is that the contribution to da can
be calculated in terms of the order of residual coulomb interaction. Earlier while calculating the ground state ASF
energy it was shown how a truncation in the order of Ves perturbation can give an inaccurate value of E0.

B. Cluster Based Formulations

The CEPA-0 wave-operator equations of Ωes and Ωes,edm are identical to the linearized coupled-cluster equations.
The atomic Yb EDM da calculated using CEPA-0 using the same sequence of CSFs as in Table III are given in Table
IV and the following can be inferred:

1. The results from CEPA-0 do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the MBPT results for the singly excited CSFs with core
. This is because the non-linear terms do not contribute since the conﬁguration
i

and
conﬁgurations
space is spanned by singly excited CSFs.

3. Within the whole CSF space considered, the value of da calculated using CEPA-0 is 5.9421 36, which is 25.21%
larger than the MBPT result. The diﬀerence gives a rough estimate of the contribution from the non-linear
terms in the cluster equation. It is a rough estimate as the MBPT calculation also includes the contribution
from the size-inconsistent terms, which are unphysical and are not included in the CEPA formalism.

The CEPA-0 calculation does not include size-consistent non-linear terms of Ωes and Ωes,edm. The results using the
CEPA-2 equations are tabulated in Table V. To make comparisons convenient the calculation is done with the same
choice of CSF sequence as before. Comparing with the results from the calculations using MBPT and CEPA-0 give
the following:

1. The calculation within the CSF space of singly excited even parity CSFs with core conﬁgurations

and
4f 136s
and all the odd parity CSFs is identical with the result calculated using CEPA-0. This implies that
|
the contribution from the non-linear EPV terms with Tes(1) from the even parity subspace is negligible. But,
it is diﬀerent from the MBPT result of the same CSF space. And the diﬀerence of 0.2067 67 is due to the EPO
non-linear terms, which are included in the MBPT.

2. Consider the calculation within the CSF space consisting of all the even parity CSFs and the singly excited odd
4f 136s
parity CSFs having core conﬁgurations
. The CEPA-2 and MBPT results diﬀer by less than
i

2%. But, the result from CEPA-0 diﬀers from both by more than 12%. This shows that the contribution from
non-linear terms with TPTV(1) is not negligible or the contribution from the size-consistent is signiﬁcant, with
the present results it is diﬃcult to distinguish between the two.

and

i

3. The da calculated within the whole CSF space considered is 4.5065 25 and is larger than the MBPT result by
1.4% and less than the CEPA-0 result by 31.86%. This implies that the contribution of non-linear terms to da
is very important.

The eﬀect of the EPO unlinked terms in Ωes,edm can be estimated by calculating Tes,edm with the EPO renormalization
terms included. The results are given in Table VI. The ﬁnal value with the full CSF space is 4.2446 91, which

12

is suppressed by 5.8% compared to the CEPA-2 result. This diﬀerence is due to the EPO contribution to the
renormalization term in Ωes,edm. Another property which can be compared to gain an insight on the contribution of
the size-inconsistent terms is the energy of the ground state E0. The value of E0 calculated using the wave-operator
Ωes derived here has no contribution from the size inconsistent terms but it excludes some of the less important
size-consistent terms. The diﬀerence in the value E0 calculated using the Bloch-equation and Ωes derived from the
cluster equation gives the contribution from the size inconsistent terms. Like in da the approximation is that the
contribution form the EPO size consistent terms non-linear in cluster amplitudes is very small, then the diﬀerence in
the result can in principle be accounted to the size inconsistent terms.

VII. CONCLUSION

Comparing the results from diﬀerent methods, it is clear that a size-consistent theory is preferable for high accuracy
computation of atomic EDM and the contribution from the non-linear terms in the cluster amplitude is also important.
With the present calculation the diﬀerence between the MBPT and CEPA-2 result cannot be accounted distinctly to
non-linear terms or the size-inconsistent terms. A better comparison can be made after including all the non-linear
terms in the cluster amplitudes. As the orbital space is made larger, the size of the CSF space grows very large. This
puts a limitation during the calculation as the memory requirement increases, it is manageable if the calculation is
done at the level of single particle–Moller-Plesset partitioning of the atomic Hamiltonian. At the single particle level
the cluster equation with the residual coulomb interaction Hamiltonian reduces to the method used used by Blundell
[20] and his collaborators. The inclusion of terms non-linear in cluster amplitudes is also relatively easy as compared
to the EN-partitioning. To check the quality of the wave functions, experimentally known quantities like hyperﬁne
constants and excitation energies needs to be calculated. These will be reported in our later papers.

INTRODUCTION

A combined conﬁguration-interaction (CI) many-
body-perturbation-theory (MBPT) method, applied pre-
viously to divalent atoms [1], is extended to particle-
hole states of closed-shell atoms. After derivation of
CI+MBPT expressions for particle-hole states, we will
apply the theory to calculations of energies and electric-
dipole transition probabilities for neon.

For neon, many accurate measurements of transition
rates are available, providing important tests of theory.
Reciprocally, the theory might help resolve existing dis-
crepancies among oscillator strengths (f -values) for tran-
sitions from the ground state to several excited states, for
which experiments disagree. There is also a certain de-
ﬁciency in existing ab-initio theories in neon, for which
discrepancies among many measurements and theoret-
ical calculations are unsettled. For example, the only
other elaborate ab-initio calculations (Avgoustoglou and
Beck [2]) give an oscillator strength for the h2p−1
3/23s1/2i1
neon state larger than most experimental values by more
than two standard deviations. Extensive calculations
for many transition
performed by Hibbert et al.
rates along the neon isoelectronic sequence use a general
conﬁguration-interaction code (CIV3) [4]. The calcula-
tions utilize parametric adjustments with measured ﬁne
structures, but do not completely agree with experiments
in neon and have an accuracy similar to other semiempir-
ical calculations of Seaton [5]. However, the two calcula-
tions disagree with each other for several transitions. We
hope that our calculations may help to understand better
the theoretical problems in neon and provide guidance for
the analysis of experimental data.

[3]

Some possible applications of the present CI+MBPT
method include the study of neonlike ions, Ne I – Si V, S
VII, Ar IX, Ca XI, and Fe XVII that have astrophysical

interest and have been included in the Opacity Project
(Seaton [6]). The transition data in neon and other noble
gases are also used in plasma physics, and in studying dis-
charges that ﬁnd many industrial applications in lamps
and gas lasers. The methods presented here might be also
used for improving the accuracy of MBPT or for extend-
ing CI+MBPT to more complicated open-shell atoms.

The principal theoretical diﬃculty arises from the sen-
sitivity of transition amplitudes to the interaction be-
tween closely spaced ﬁne-structure components. Al-
though it is possible to obtain energies which are rea-
sonably precise on an absolute scale using coupled-
cluster methods (Ilyabaev and Kaldor [7]), accurate ﬁne-
structure splittings seem very diﬃcult to obtain without
semiempirical adjustments. This is why semiempirical
approaches, which have ﬁne-structure intervals carefully
adjusted, are more successful in neon than are ab-initio
calculations. However, as we will demonstrate in this
paper, CI calculations corrected with MBPT are also
capable of accurately predicting ﬁne-structure splittings
and, consequently, transition amplitudes. In this paper,
we will demonstrate the excellent precision of CI plus
second-order MBPT. Third-order corrections, for which
numerical codes already exist [8], can also be included,
providing even further improvement in accuracy.

In the following section, we use the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian formalism and particle-hole single-double cou-
pled equations to derive expressions for the second-order
Hamiltonian matrix of the CI+MBPT method. In the ﬁ-
nal expressions, we present a quite accurate new MBPT
that can predict energies of hole states and can describe
appropriately the interactions in particle-hole atoms.
The accuracy of hole energies obtained with the new
MBPT will be illustrated for neon and low-Z neon-like
ions. Our CI+MBPT energies and f -values for many
states of neon are tabulated. Their agreement with ex-
periment and other theories are shown.

The accuracy of the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger variant of
second-order MBPT given in [9] is insuﬃcient for pur-
pose, so that more accurate single-double equations must
be used. The formulas for the correlation operator and

a system of coupled equations for the correlation coef-
ﬁcients are given in [10]; we follow the notation of [10]
in the the paragraphs below. Under certain conditions,
those equations can be further simpliﬁed and rewritten
in the following form:

In the second equation of this set, the term
is
subtracted from both sides of this equation to make the
right-hand side small. Since large random-phase approxi-
mation (RPA) corrections in the particle-hole CI+MBPT
are treated by CI, the quantities W v
va′ entering this set
of equations on the right-hand side in Ref. [10] are small
and have been neglected here. The concern might be
raised for the correlation coeﬃcients χas
v, which
generally would have small factors (εv + εb − εa − εs) or
(εv − εr) in front. However, for the large CI model space,
energies of the core-virtual orbitals bs are well separated
from the energies of the valence-hole orbitals av. The

Note that in the last equation we have extended the
single-double method. The last term entering δ
va in
the single-double formalism would normally not contain
gadad in the denominator. However, if we do not modify
this denominator, we ﬁnd that in the third-order MBPT,
e
gadad will appear leading to
large terms proportional to
a decrease in accuracy. A physical reason for modify-
e
ing the denominator of this term is that the process de-
scribed by this term contains two holes in the intermedi-
ate states with large interaction energy. This interaction
should be treated nonperturbatively, for example, by in-
gadad into the denominator as we have done on
clusion of
the basis of the single-double equations in other terms.
e
Finally, this term is almost equal to the seventh term
(they are complex conjugates and their Goldstone dia-
grams are related by a reﬂection through a horizontal
axis), and for convenience they are set equal in numer-
ical calculations. The angular reduction for δ
va can
be easily obtained using the second-order particle-hole
formulas given in Ref. [9].

III. A SOLUTION OF THE HOLE-ENERGY
PROBLEM

A. Breit corrections

Apart from Coulomb correlation corrections, the Breit
magnetic interaction is also important in neon and the
isoelectronic ions. The breakdown of various Coulomb
and relativistic contributions to the energy of 3s states
of neon are given in Ref. [10]. Breit corrections cancel,
but for higher excited states they may not. Hence, to
improve the accuracy of ﬁne-structure splittings, we in-
clude the Hartree-Fock hole Breit correction B(HF)
in our
calculations,

aa

B(HF)

aa =

bacca.

X

c e

(8)

aa

We have checked that the ﬁrst-order corrections B(1) to
the energies of J = 2 and J = 1 states given in Table I
of Ref. [10] agree with our B(HF)
contributions, 0.00062
and 0.00090 a.u., for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states, respectively.
We omit the small frequency-dependent Breit, quantum-
reduced-mass, and mass-polarization
electrodynamic,
corrections. Small as they are, those corrections are fur-
ther reduced after subtraction for the ﬁne-structure in-
tervals. More careful treatment of relativistic corrections
is needed in calculations of high-Z neon-like ions.

B. Calculations of hole energies for neonlike ions

Since we propose a new variant of the MBPT expan-
sion, we would like ﬁrst to demonstrate that this expan-
sion is convergent for hole states. The theoretical hole
energies shown in Table I have been obtained in the V (N )
HF potential using Eq. (6) for δRa
a to calculate second-
order corrections. The extra term in the denominator is
important and is necessary for convergence of the per-
turbation expansion. Experimental hole energies in the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
database Ref. [11] are found as the limit energies for the
neon isoelectronic sequence. For neutral neon only one
limit, the p3/2 energy is given in NIST [11]. The 2p1/2-
2p3/2 splitting 780.4269(36) cm−1 has been measured in
Ref. [12], and using this value we ﬁnd the experimental
p1/2 energy. Table I demonstrates the good agreement of
our theoretical p3/2, p1/2 energies as well as the same ﬁne
structure interval for neon-like ions. Our ﬁne structure
interval, whose correctness is crucial for transition ampli-
tude calculations, diﬀers from experiment just by about
10 cm−1. Note that the HF value 187175 cm−1 for the
2p3/2 state is 8.5% higher than the experimental value
173930 cm−1, and, after adding correlation corrections,
we obtain improvement by a factor of ten. For the ﬁne
structure, the HF value 1001cm−1 disagrees even more,
If we use Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation
by 28%.

and the agreement with experiment does not improve.

IV. NEON ENERGIES AND OSCILLATOR
STRENGTHS OF J=1 ODD STATES

To test the accuracy of the CI+MBPT method, we
ﬁrst calculated energies of several lowest odd J=1 neon
states, Table II. The number of conﬁgurations in CI was
chosen to be 52. The order of eigenstates obtained in
CI+MBPT is the same as the order of the experimental
levels. We abbreviate long NIST designations since the
levels are uniquely speciﬁed by energy or by order.

The pure ab-initio energies diﬀer from experimental
energies by 0.0069 a.u., but after subtraction of the sys-
tematic shift (which does not make much diﬀerence in
transition calculations), the agreement is at the level of
0.0001 a.u. for almost all states. Therefore, we consider
the accuracy of CI+MBPT adequate for correct predic-
tion of level mixing and oscillator strengths. For the 3s
states, agreement with experiment for the ﬁne structure
interval is much better than that obtained by Avgous-
toglou et al. [10], 0.0002 versus 0.0012 a.u.; a possible

explanation for this could be that single-double equa-
tions miss important corrections which we included by
modifying the denominators. In Ref. [10], however, the
systematic shift is small.

Finally, we present our CI+MBPT oscillator strengths
in neon. After diagonalization of the second-order eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian, we obtain wave functions in the form
of expansion coeﬃcients in the CI space and use them
to calculate oscillator strengths. Size-consistent formu-
las for dipole matrix elements for transitions decaying
into the ground state are provided in Ref. [2], where the
absorption oscillator strength f is also deﬁned. We give
in this table ab-initio values of the oscillator strengths
f . The dominant part of the RPA corrections is included
at the level of CI. Small normalization corrections are
omitted.

Many experiments have disagreements in oscillator
strengths far exceeding the cited errors (see Fig. 1 and
Table IV): hence, for comparison, we give in Table III
two statistical averages: the ﬁrst is a weighted accord-

FIG. 1: Comparison with experiment for oscillator strengths
of the [p−1

3/23s]1 state of neon

ing to cited standard deviations and the second is an
unweighted average. For the 3s levels, the experimental
data compiled in Ref. [2] and for the higher excited levels
in Ref. [30] have been included in the averaging. Average
values obtained here are not necessarily the most accu-
rate, but they serve well for comparison and for a test of
our probably less accurate calculated values.

A more careful analysis of experimental techniques to
exclude systematic errors, which are deﬁnitely present, is
necessary; our values can provide some guidance. For
p−1
3/23d states, since the energy separation of the two
states is small, experiments give the sum of the two oscil-
lator strengths, and the value 0.0196 rather than 0.0130
should be compared with the experimental values 0.0187
(0.0199). In this table, we also compare our theory with
other semiempirical theories. Surprisingly, early calcu-
lations by Aleksandrov et al. [13] agree well with our
calculations. A fair agreement, considering the high sen-
sitivity of these transitions to correlation correction, is
also obtained with the other theories in the table.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have introduced CI+MBPT theory
for particle-hole states of closed-shell atoms. A diﬃculty
that the hole energy has poor convergence is overcome

s
with modiﬁcations of denominators in MBPT. Good pre-
cision for hole states and for particle-hole states is illus-
trated for many energy levels of neon. Apart from en-
ergies, our theory is tested in calculations of oscillator
strengths. Agreement with averaged experimental values
is achieved.

A recent evaluation of the frequency uncertainty expected for an optical frequency standard based
on a single trapped 43Ca+ ion was published in Phys. Rev. A 72 (2005) 043404. The paper contains
some interesting information like systematic frequency shifts but fails to depict their uncertainty,
leading to confuse accuracy and precision. The conclusions about the major contribution to the
frequency shift are not consistent with the presented calculations and omit comparisons with data
published previously.

Optical frequency standards based on single trapped
ions may reach ultimate performances which are orders of
magnitude better than the existing cesium clocks in the
microwave domain [1]. A recent evaluation of residual
eﬀects in a frequency standard based on a single 43Ca+
ion predicts an ultimate attainable precision below 10−15
[2]. This evaluation takes into account shifts due to local
ﬁelds neglecting their uncertainty. In this comment we
show that a more complete and precise analysis of the
residual ﬁeld eﬀects is necessary to predict the potential
frequency uncertainty [3].

The proposal of a single 43Ca+ ion stored in an rf trap
as an optical frequency standard is based on its ultra-
narrow (∆νnat < 160 mHz) electrical quadrupole clock

transition at 4.1×1014 Hz and its relatively simple energy
level scheme with all wavelengths in the optical domain,
allowing the concept of an all solid-state laser set-up (cf.
ﬁgure 1).

(cid:12)

The advantage of using the very rare (0.135% of natu-
ral abundance) odd isotope 43Ca+ compared to the most
abundant 40Ca+ relies in the possibility of eliminating
the ﬁrst order Zeeman shift by using a m = 0 sublevel,
while the second order Zeeman shift is minimized by
the choice for the clock transition of the hyperﬁne levels
3D5/2, F = 6(cid:11) [2, 3]. Although the
4S1/2, F = 4(cid:11) and (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
value of the magnetic ﬁeld and its ﬂuctuations remain an
important issue as this may be one of the major causes
of uncertainty in the frequency shifts, the evaluation of
this uncertainty is not addressed in [2]. A minimum mag-
netic ﬁeld is indeed required to split the chosen transition
3D5/2, 6, ±1(cid:11),
from the two closest ones (cid:12)
(cid:12)
however the choice made in [2] of a 0.2 µT (2 mG) mag-
netic ﬁeld is not motivated and the expected ﬂuctuations
of such a ﬁeld are not given. Magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
as big as 0.2 µT over one day have been observed in
an unshielded environnement [4]. Then, exploiting the
3D5/2, 6, ±2(cid:11)
4S1/2, 4, 0(cid:11) → (cid:12)
linear Zeeman shift of the (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
transitions like suggested in [2] may not be suﬃcient to
correct these ﬂuctuations over one day. As the Zeeman
eﬀect is quadratic, its ﬂuctuations depend linearly on the
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and on the amplitude of its
ﬂuctuations. With a 0.2 µT magnetic ﬁeld and 0.2 µT
ﬂuctuations, the Zeeman frequency shift uncertainty is
twice the Zeeman shift itself and reaches 0.72 Hz. In fact,
the choice of the magnetic ﬁeld results from a compro-
mise between maintaining a high level of ﬂuorescence [5],
splitting the sublevel transitions and keeping the Zeeman
eﬀect ﬂuctuations low. A complete description of the
magnetic ﬁeld (average value and ﬂuctuations) is there-
fore needed to estimate the uncertainty induced by the
Zeeman eﬀect, which is missing in [2].

The other signiﬁcant eﬀect causing frequency shift is
the Stark eﬀect.
It can be evaluated through the po-
larizability of the states involved in the clock transition.
The calculation presented in [2] is however only partial.
On the one hand, the anisotropic contribution (tensorial
part) of the D5/2 polarizability is not mentioned. This

contribution is not relevant as long as the major contri-
bution to the local electric ﬁeld is caused by the black-
body radiation, as considered in [2]. Nevertheless, when
one considers cooling the vessel to reduce this contribu-
tion, as realized in the 199Hg+ frequency standard [6],
this anisotropic contribution must be taken into account
[3]. On the other hand, reference [2] gives no estimation
of the uncertainty of the calculated polarizability. The
polarizability of the S1/2 state is well known since the
sum of the oscillator strengths taken into account is very
close to 1. On the contrary, as pointed out in [3], the
D5/2 state polarizability has a large error bar because
the sum of all the oscillator strengths of the known tran-
sitions is only 0.48. The uncertainty of the polarizability
is therefore almost as big as the estimated polarizability
itself and it induces a non-negligible uncertainty of the
Stark shift. We found that, for a vessel at 300 K, the
Stark shift is 0.39 Hz, which agrees with the result of [2],
but we showed that the uncertainty of this shift can be
as big as ±0.27 Hz, and can become the major contribu-
tion in the overall error budget. As for the eﬀect of the
coupling of the electric quadrupole moment of the 3D5/2
state to any electric ﬁeld gradient, its contribution to the
uncertainty can be reduced to the 0.1 Hz level [2, 3] by
measuring the transition frequency for three orthogonal
directions of the magnetic ﬁeld, like ﬁrst proposed in [7].

In a thorough investigation of line-broadening eﬀects,
the AC Stark (or light) shift depending on the laser inten-
sity used to probe the clock transition at 729 nm should
also be evaluated. Actually, for a Rabi frequency of 1000
s−1 and a detuning smaller than ±10 Hz to probe the
low- and the high-frequency side of the clock transition,
the eﬀect may be as small as ±6 mHz for a magnetic ﬁeld
of 0.1 µT [3].

In summary, the overall uncertainty budget given in
[2] is not complete. First, the most signiﬁcant frequency
shift does not come from the quadratic Zeeman eﬀect
since the static Stark eﬀect is as big as this last eﬀect
(0.40 Hz compared to -0.36 Hz). Second, the uncertainty
of the frequency shifts must be evaluated to estimate the
precision of the clock [1], which is missing in [2]. In our
previous paper [3], we conclude that, if at 300 K, the ma-
jor source of relative frequency uncertainty (±9 × 10−16)
would be due to the Stark eﬀect, for a vessel cooled down
to 77 K, the uncertainty would result from the ﬂuctua-
tions of the quadratic Zeeman eﬀect and from the exper-
imental uncertainty in pointing three orthogonal direc-
tions for compensating the quadrupole shift. It was es-
timated to ±4 × 10−16 (relative uncertainty) with room
for improvement. All the contributions to the system-
atic frequency shift and its uncertainty are summarized
in table I which is reproduced from reference [3].

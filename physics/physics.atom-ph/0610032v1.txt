Note on the exact Keldysh theory of strong-ﬁeld ionization: residue method vs
saddle-point approximation

In recent articles [Mishima et al., Phys. Rev. A, 66, 033401 (2002); Chao, Phys. Rev. A, 72,
053414 (2005)] it was proposed to use the residue theorem for the exact calculation of the tran-
sition amplitude describing strong-ﬁeld ionization of atomic systems within Keldysh theory. This
should avoid the necessity to apply the method of steepest descent (saddle-point approximation).
Comparing the results of both approaches for atomic hydrogen a diﬀerence by a factor of 2 was
found for the 1s, and an even more drastic deviation for the 2s state. Thus it was concluded that
the use of the saddle-point approximation is problematic. In this work the deviations are explained
and it is shown that the previous conclusion is based on an unjustiﬁed neglect of an important
contribution occurring in the application of the residue theorem. Furthermore, the applicability of
the method of steepest descent for the ionization of Rydberg states is discussed and an improvement
of the standard result is suggested that successfully removes the otherwise drastic failure for large
principal quantum numbers.

INTRODUCTION

The ionization process in atomic systems exposed to
a strong laser ﬁeld has attracted great interest during
the past decades and its proper modeling remains a chal-
lenge to theory [1]. Among the numerous approximations
developed to treat this problem Keldysh theory [2] pos-
sesses a prominent role. This theory was proposed by
Keldysh 40 years ago and describes the ionization pro-
cess as a transition between an initial electronic bound
and a Volkov continuum state (adopting the length gauge
formulation). Besides the main approximation of the
Keldysh theory, the neglect of the interaction of the es-
caping electron with the long-range Coulomb potential
(in the case of a neutral atom), two additional simpli-
ﬁcations were made in [2]: (i) the method of steepest
descent (MSD) [3] (saddle-point approximation) for per-
forming an occurring contour integral, and (ii) the as-
sumption of a small kinetic momentum of the escaping
electron. The Keldysh approximation and variants of
it are also very popular, because they are the basis for
methods that predict strong-ﬁeld ionization rates also for
heavier atoms and molecules (see, e. g., [4, 5]).

Recently, there has been proposals to obtain an exact
Keldysh theory by removing the two additional simpliﬁ-
cations (i) and (ii). It was especially suggested to avoid
approximation (i) by solving the occurring contour in-
tegrals with the aid of the exact residue theorem (RT)
instead of the MSD [6, 7, 8]. It was shown that the RT
method yields a two times larger transition amplitude
for the 1s state of a hydrogen-like atom and, as a conse-
quence, a four times larger ionization rate. Furthermore,
the ionization rate of the ﬁrst excited (2s) state obtained
in [8] when applying the RT diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
MSD result. In view of the popularity of the MSD ap-
proximation for treating strong-ﬁeld problems like ioniza-
tion [9] or high-harmonic generation [10] this is of course

a very important result. This has motivated the present
study in which a careful reinvestigation of the RT and
the MSD is performed (Sec. II). It is shown that the ap-
plication of the RT as proposed in [6, 7, 8] contains an
unjustiﬁed neglect of the contribution of one integral and
that it is this omission which is the main source for the
previously reported deviation between the RT and the
MSD results. Therefore, the MSD provides in fact more
reliable results than the (incomplete) RT approach. It
is furthermore discussed that the MSD fails for Rydberg
states and a correction to it is proposed. The conclusions
of Sec. II are supported with the aid of a numerical study
in Sec. III.

II. THEORY

A. Transition amplitude

In order to provide the basis for the subsequent discus-
sion and to introduce the notation a brief summary of the
Keldysh theory is given that follows closely the one de-
scribed in Appendix A of [11]. The total ionization rate
of a one-electron atomic system with the electron bind-
ing energy Eb in the harmonic laser ﬁeld F(t) = F cos ωt,
with the period T = 2π/ω, can be expressed as the sum
over N -photon processes (atomic units are used through-
out this work)

The transition amplitude A(p) in (9) is for f (v) =

v2 identical to L(p) in [2] which is also the start-
ing point of the analysis in [6]. Since the square root is
usually deﬁned to possess a non-negative real part which
can in the present context be misleading and cause a sign
error, we introduce the function

is a multivalued function, so we have selected also the
branch cut along positive imaginary axis.

Due to the delta function in Eq.(1) one needs to calcu-

(8) and (9) can equivalently be used for numerical inte-
gration to yield an exact result. The use of (9) provides
more ﬂexibility, since the contour Cin can be deformed in
a convenient way.

There exist two special points u± (A4) in the complex
plane u. They are simultaneously the saddle points of
S(u) and poles of ˜V0(u). In [2] Keldysh has used MSD
to approximate A(p). In [6] the authors have proposed
to use RT [3] for an exact calculation of A(p). For the 1s
state of hydrogen-like atoms the expression for A(p) ob-
tained in [6] is larger than that of Keldysh using MSD by
exactly a factor of two, provided the small p approxima-
tion is consistently used or omitted in both the RT and
the MSD approach. As is shown below, the disagreement
is a consequence of a wrong assumption made in [6]. In
fact, for excited states of hydrogen-like atoms the therein
proposed approach may lead to drastically wrong results.
For spherically symmetric bound states of hydrogen-
like atoms with principal quantum number n the function
˜V0(u) can be presented (see Appendix B) as

special points u±. Both procedures (MSD and RT) are
considered in this work for general ˜V0(u) having poles of
order ν at u = u±.

In [6] the value of Iout is implicitly assumed to be zero.

Therefore, it is impossible to select Cout in such a way
that the integrand on the whole contour approaches zero.
Moreover, in section III it is numerically demonstrated
that Iout is of the same order of magnitude as A(p) or
even larger.

Since no diﬀerence is made between two diﬀerent con-
tour integrations around the same saddle point (as, e. g.,
for I +

the main steps. From (20) the relations

(29)

Therefore, MSD predicts I ±
s to be equal for even ν and
to diﬀer only by the sign for odd ν. Using equations (22)
and (24) this result can be rewritten as

Iout = (

[within MSD].

Using (22) the prediction of MSD for A(p) is

(31)

Substitution of (30) into (17) shows that for odd ν MSD
yields

A(p)

[MSD, odd ν].

Its value is thus two times smaller than the one obtained
with the assumption Iout = 0. For even ν MSD predicts

Note, (32) and (33) are valid for every ˜V0(u) satisfying
(13), if g±(u) is a slowly varying function in the vicinity of
u±. The fact that for the 1s state of hydrogen-like atoms
(ν = 3) one ﬁnds exactly a factor 2 diﬀerence between
MSD and RT and thus an equality sign in (32) should
be seen as an accidental case that is due to the relative
simplicity of ˜V0(u) for the 1s state.

In section III MSD is tested numerically and it is shown
that the assumption of a slowly varying function g±(u)
is valid only for small n (or ν).

III. NUMERICAL TEST

To support our conclusions of the previous section the
example results of a numerical study are reported in
Table I. For a more transparent analysis a number of
parameters were ﬁxed. This includes the amplitude of
the electric ﬁeld F = 0.02 a.u., the frequency ω = 0.01
a.u., the binding energy Eb = Z 2/(2n2) = 0.5 a.u. (thus
charge Z = n), the angle ˆF
ˆp = 0.9, and the number
of photons N = 161. With such a choice of ﬁxed pa-
rameters a variation of the principal quantum number n
leaves the function S(u) unchanged (see Appendix A for
details). The same is true for the positions of the special
points u± and the values of Q±. Therefore, only function
˜V0(u) varies with n.

·

We use (8) to calculate the exact value Aex of A(p)
and (15) to evaluate A±. The integrals I ±
s are calculated
numerically, Eq.(22) and (23) are used for a check of the
numerics and Iout is obtained from (24).

As follows from the discussion above, the condition
I −
s obtained in (29) can be used as a cri-
s ≈
terion for the validity of the simple MSD formula (31).

Therefore, function ˜V0(u) cannot be given as simple as
in (13). Instead, ˜V0(u) can be represented in the vicin-
ity of us by a sum over terms having diﬀerent orders of
poles (see Eq.(B7)). Moreover, it is possible to consider
also higher derivatives of S(u), as is done in Eq.(C2).
The resulting representation of ˜V0(u) exp[iS(u)] given in
Eq.(C3) and the subsequent use of MSD to it leads to
a much higher accuracy. As can be seen from Table I
and Fig. 3 the corrected MSD formula (C5) yields a sig-
niﬁcant improvement and can be used for the numerical
computation of A(p) in a large range of n.

IV. CONCLUSION

(Color online) Demonstration of the failure of the
FIG. 3:
MSD for large principal quantum numbers n. The ratio
|Iout/Aex| (boxes) grows exponentially with n which causes
an increase of the ratio |AMSD/Aex| (circles) between the ap-
proximate and exact amplitudes AMSD and Aex, respectively.
Therefore, the simple (standard) MSD formula [Eq.(31)] fails
and must be improved to be applicable for large n. The in this
work proposed corrected MSD formula [Eq.(C5)] shows very
good accuracy in a large region of n, as can be seen from the
corresponding ratio |AcMSD/Aex| (triangles). The parameters
used in the computation are the same as in Table I.

Table I shows that this condition is fulﬁlled for n = 1, 2
and the relations (30,32,33) are valid. With increasing n
the condition is, however, not well fulﬁlled and the accu-
racy of the MSD prediction decreases. Numerical tests

In this work it has been demonstrated that the residue
theorem was not correctly employed in [6, 7], since the
derivation was based on an unjustiﬁed assumption that
one integral vanishes. This neglected term is, however,
of the same order of magnitude as the remaining ones or
even much larger. For the 1s state of hydrogen-like atoms
it is almost identical, and thus its omission results in an
overestimation of the transition amplitude by a factor
two for this case. This deviation was in [6] incorrectly
assumed to be a failure of the widely used saddle-point
approximation. Considering a 2s state, it is furthermore
concluded that an application of the method proposed
in [6] to a 2s state would yield an even larger (erroneous)
deviation.

Such a large deviation for the 2s state was in fact re-
ported in [8] where also the residue method had been
applied. Analogously to [6] the deviation was attributed
to a failure of the saddle-point method, but is in fact
due to the same unjustiﬁed omission of a non-vanishing
integral. The direct applicability of the present ﬁndings
to [8] can be veriﬁed, since the derivation in [8] diﬀers

from [6] essentially only by the choice of φ = ωt as com-
plex variable, while in [6] and the present work u = sin ωt
was used.

The applicability of the method of steepest descent
(saddle-point approximation) for arbitrary ns states has
also been investigated in the present work. It is found
that the simple standard formula fails for large n. To
overcome this problem a corrected formula is proposed.

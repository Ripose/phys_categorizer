The density operator of the arbitrary physical system must be positive deﬁnite. Employing the
general master equation technique which preserves this property we derive equations of motion for
the density operator of an active atom which interacts collisionally with the reservoir of perturber
atoms. The obtained general relations applied to the two-level atom yield Bloch-Boltzmann equa-
tions (BBE). The form of the BBE obtained by us diﬀers from that known from literature which, as
we show, are not guaranteed to preserve the required positivity. We argue that our results are the
correct ones and as such should be used in practical applications. Moreover, the structure and the
terms which appear in our set of BBE seem to allow simpler and more straightforward physical
interpretation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A lot of experiments in atomic physics and spec-
troscopy consists in investigating active atoms coupled
to incident (laser) radiation and immersed in the ther-
mal bath of perturbers which, typically, are the atoms of
noble gas. Various phenomena occurring in such a sys-
tem as well as its properties are then investigated. The
amount of work devoted to such studies is enormous, it
is therefore quite impossible even to list all relevant lit-
erature, except a few essential monographs reviewing the
subject [1, 2].

The theoretical description of the discussed system
must account for two major aspects. Firstly, the cou-
pling of active atoms to the incoming radiation ﬁeld
and the radiative spontaneous phenomena must be prop-
erly described. This is usually done by means of stan-
dard methods of quantum optics [3, 4]. As a result
one obtains a set of equations of motion for the ma-
trix elements of the atomic density operator. When the
atom is described within a two-level model the obtained
equations are known as optical Bloch equations. Sec-
ondly, active atoms undergo collisions both with per-
turbers and among themselves. The inﬂuence of colli-
sions on physical properties of the system constituents is
of paramount importance and is in itself a separate ﬁeld
of experimental and theoretical studies. Discussion of
these problems in their full generality clearly goes beyond
the scope of the present work. Let us however mention,
that in spectroscopical applications the eﬀect of collisions
is usually accounted for by suitably derived (quantum-
mechanically or classically) collision terms. Historically
speaking, Boltzmann was the ﬁrst to introduce the colli-
sion terms into the equations of motion of the probability
distributions. Therefore, for a two-level atom, the combi-

nation of optical Bloch equations together with collision
terms might be called Bloch-Boltzmann equations (BBE)
which account for both kinds of the discussed interactions
inﬂuencing the behavior of active atoms. However, we
feel it necessary to stress that the name Bloch-Boltzmann
equations need not be restricted to two-level atoms. Gen-
eralizations to more complex atomic models do not pose
serious conceptual diﬃculties, though the form of corre-
sponding equations of motion might be much more com-
plicated.

The main aim of this paper is to reexamine the origin
and form of the collision terms in Bloch-Boltzmann equa-
tions. We shall mostly study a simple two-level model,
because it is formally the simplest, it allows the sim-
plest interpretations, yet retaining the most important
(at least in a qualitative manner) features of realistic
physical situations and experiments. The motivation for
our research is the following. First of all we note, that
the density operator of an arbitrary physical system must
always be positive deﬁnite. It is not clear whether the
collision terms, used within the literature which is known
to us, have this property. Moreover, they seem to exhibit
other drawbacks or inconsistencies. These terms are de-
rived (quantum-mechanically or classically) by using ar-
guments similar to those leading to collision integrals of
standard Boltzmann equation [1]. We shall try to present
a consistent theory which will, hopefully, allow us to clar-
ify the question of positive deﬁniteness as well as some
more subtle points.

The tools necessary to construct the proper form of
BBE describing the system (active atoms) coupled to a
reservoir (perturbers) are provided by the quantum the-
ory of dynamical semigroups which entail the general
It is worth stressing
master equation (ME) methods.
that we have in mind mathematically rigorous version of
the ME theory based on completely positive quantum dy-
namical semigroups. The extensive review of this subject
is given in monographs [5, 6], where the authors derive
and discuss the most general (sometimes called the Lind-
blad form [7, 8]) ME which preserves the positivity of the

considered density operator. Sec. II will, therefore, be
devoted to a brief review of the essentials of this theory.
In Sec.
III we discuss how the general theory can be
formally adapted to describe a mixture of two gaseous
species when various models of internal structure of ac-
tive atoms can be employed. We outline the procedures
necessary to ﬁnd explicit expressions for formal quan-
tities introduced in the preceding section. We also try
to identify physical assumptions needed to validate the
presented theory. We restrict our attention to two-level
atoms and, hence, in Sec. IV we give the derivation of
the formal Bloch-Boltzmann equations in the above dis-
cussed sense. Finally, Sec.V is devoted to the discussion
of our results in the view of the facts known from the
literature. Some features of the obtained BBE are dif-
ferent from those known from other sources. We argue
that our results are the proper ones. Since we employ
much diﬀerent theoretical formalism, the comparison of
our results with other ones seems to be of an essential
importance.

As we have already stated, we focus our attention on
the collisional phenomena occurring in the active-atom-
perturber gaseous mixture. Therefore, we leave the ra-
diative eﬀects out of the picture. We shall, however,
brieﬂy indicate how, and under what conditions, such
eﬀects can be incorporated back into our formalism.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The physical system we will consider in this work, is
a mixture of active atoms (A) with density NA and per-
turbers of density Np. We assume that NA ≪ Np, which
allows us to neglect the A − A collisions. Thus, only
A−P collisions can aﬀect the motion of the active atoms.
Moreover, we assume that the density of perturbers is
such, that only binary A− P collisions are of importance.
The relatively dense perturber gas acts as a reservoir of
energy and momentum and inﬂuences the velocity dis-
tributions of the active atoms. On the other hand, it is
usually safe to assume that P − P collisions are frequent
enough to assure rapid thermalization of the perturbers.
This allows us to think of a perturber bath as being in
thermal equilibrium, so that the velocity distribution of
P atoms is time-independent and given by a Maxwellian

with u2
p = 2kBT /mp being the square of the most prob-
able velocity of perturber atoms with mass mp, at tem-
perature T . The stated physical conditions are not really
very restrictive. They are fairly well satisﬁed by a great
number of realistic experiments [1].

A. Master equation for the quantum-classical
system

The master equation techniques stem from the theory
of quantum dynamical semigroups applied to an open
system, that is to a system which interacts with another
one which serves as a reservoir. The active atoms may
be considered as the quantum-mechanical open system
which is coupled to the reservoir consisting of the per-
turbers. The interaction between the two subsystems
is manifested by the collisions occurring between A and
P particles. The proper theoretical framework for the
description of an open system, which ensures the preser-
vation of positivity of the reduced density operator of the
system of interest (active atoms), is supplied by the mas-
ter equation (ME) approach [5]. It is not our aim to re-
view the theory or derivation of ME. We shall rather ap-
ply the general ME to a class of open systems which can
be called quantum-classical ones. We study a quantum-
mechanical open system, the states of which span the
Hilbert space

H =

Hα.

(2)

α
M
The index α belongs to a set A which, for current pur-
poses, is assumed to be discrete, but will subsequently
be generalized to continuous one. A more physical in-
terpretation of the spaces Hα will be given later. We
assume that within space H there exists a strong deco-
herence mechanism [9, 10, 11] which practically excludes
quantum superpositions of the form

| ψα1 i ⊕ | ψα2 i ⊕ . . . . . . .

(3)

This is due to environmental decoherence mechanism,
which is a generally accepted explanation of the ab-
sence of superpositions of macroscopically distinguish-
able states (Schr¨odinger cat problem) and emergence
of classical properties, called dynamical superselection
rules. The most eﬀective physical mechanism leading to
strong decoherence is provided by many subsequent colli-
sions of the particles of the investigated system with the
environment particles [5].

On each space Hα we deﬁne a reduced density operator

ρα. The family of such operators

ρ = {ρα}α∈A,

(4)

forms partially diagonal, quantum-classical density oper-
ator which describes the properties of the relevant (open)
system. The operators ρα have the following properties

The most general form of the Markovian master
equation for our quantum-classical density operator can

be obtained from the general form of the generator of
the completely positive quantum dynamical semigroup
(Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan form). The
relevance of complete positivity in the theory of quantum
open systems is extensively discussed in Refs.[5, 6]. The
corresponding master equation derived along these lines,
which governs the evolution of the quantum-classical den-
sity operator of the relevant system due to its interaction
with the reservoir, reads (in the Schr¨odinger picture)

The speciﬁc form of the Hamiltonian ˆHα depends on the
particular physical properties of the studied relevant sys-
tem. Operators ˆS ξ
αβ depend on the interaction between
the relevant subsystem and the reservoir. Recently the
equation of this type has found its application in the
quantum measurement theory (see the contribution of
Blanchard and Jadczyk in [9], where its properties are
also widely discussed).

B. Master equation for an atom immersed in
perturber gas

General and rather formal master equation (6) has to
be adapted to describe the presently discussed system,
that is the moving (with velocity ~v) atom which collides
with the perturbers. We shall proceed taking care of any
additional or simplifying assumptions which go beyond
the ones adopted in the derivation of ME (6). Moreover,
we will proceed in a manner, which may be useful when
considering active atoms with the internal structure more
general than the simple two-level model.

The collisions with perturber particles lead to strong
decoherence which together with the uniform spatial dis-
tribution of interacting particles justify the use of the
density operators which are diagonal in momentum (or
velocity) representation. Therefore, the discrete decom-
position in Eq.(2) can be replaced by a continuous one
which is taken to be with respect to the velocity ~v of an
active atom. Thus, Eq.(2) is modiﬁed and becomes

H =

d~v H~v,

with

~v ∈ R3.

(8)

The ensemble of active particles is now described by a
partially diagonal density operator ρ(~v). We associate
the space H~v with the state space of an active atom which
possesses velocity ~v. We introduce a set of operators
{Sa}, which constitutes a basis in the space of relevant
operators acting on H~v. The speciﬁc form of operator ba-
sis depends on the model chosen to describe the internal
structure of an active atom. One may choose a multi-
level model for which one has Sa = Skl = | k ih l |, with
k, l = 1, 2, . . . , n, and with | k i being the energy eigen-
states. Alternatively, spherical tensor operators might be
taken as a basis which is appropriate for atoms with spa-
tially degenerate energy levels. Later on, we will consider
a simple two-level model and we will explicitly deﬁne the
necessary operator basis.

First we analyze the hamiltonian term in (6). To this
end we expand it in the operator basis {Sa}, and we write

ha(~v)Sa.

The particular form of the functions ha(~v) need not be
speciﬁed now. By the proper choice of these functions
we can model various physical situations, some of which
will be discussed later. For now, the ﬁrst (hamiltonian)
term of master equation becomes

It must be, however, noted that the Hamiltonian H(~v)
should be hermitian, so the functions ha(~v) must satisfy
some additional conditions, the particular form of which
depend on the choice of the operator basis. We shall
illustrate this point when applying the general formalism
to derivation of the Bloch-Boltzmann equations for a two-
level atom.

Since the indices α and β are replaced by the ”classi-
cal” degrees of freedom, that is by velocities, when con-
structing the second term of ME (6) we must replace the
summation over the index β by integration over veloc-
ities. Following the general rules given in [5] we may
rewrite the second term in the ME as

αβρβ( ˆS ξ
ˆS ξ

βα)†

d~v′ Kab(~v ← ~v′)Saρ(~v′)S†

b . (11)

This term obviously has the sense of an operator which
describes the transitions from a velocity group around
~v′ to the velocity interval (~v, ~v + d~v). Hence it can be
called a ”gain” term. We shall postpone the discussion
of the integral kernel to the further sections. At present,
according to relation (11), we shall only require that for
any velocities ~v and ~v′

Kab(~v ← ~v′) − positively deﬁned matrix,

(12)

of the necessary dimensions. This matrix contains the
details of the collisional interaction between the active
and perturber atoms which will also be discussed later.
Following further the principles of the construction of
the ME [5], we proceed to the third term in (6).
It is
an anticommutator and it is built similarly to the former
one. Namely, it can be rewritten as

(13)

where the curly brackets denote an anticommutator.
This term also describes the transition – escape from a
velocity group (~v, ~v + d~v) to any other velocity, so it is
a ”loss” term.

Combining the discussed three terms, we now con-
struct the master equation for a density operator of the
moving active atom. We note, that no additional approx-
imations (apart from those involved in the derivation of
the general ME (6)) were made. Thus we have

Let us note that the integration over velocity in the last

troduce the rate

The obtained ME is an operator equation. For practical
purposes it is then convenient to expand the density op-
erator ρ(~v) in suitably selected operator basis. One can
then compute all the necessary operator commutators
and products, thus obtaining the equations of motion for
the matrix elements of the density operator. We shall do
so in the further section, by adopting a simple two-level
model. Nevertheless, we stress that the presented ME
(16) can be employed for atomic models more general
than just the simple two-level one.

III. MICROSCOPIC DERIVATION OF
Kab(~v ← ~v′)

4

The formalism so far presented is fairly general. We
proceed with its further discussion and clariﬁcation. The
gain term (11) and the loss one (13) which describe the
irreversible evolution of the relevant system stem from
its interaction with environment. In our case, collisions
are the manifestation of this interaction. The physical
details concerning collisions are hidden in, so far rather
formal, collision kernels Kab(~v ← ~v′) which were left un-
speciﬁed. Certainly, their structure and mathematical
properties follow from the procedures used when deriv-
ing the necessary master equation.

Derivation of the master equation for an open quantum
system from the underlying fundamental Hamiltonian
dynamics was the subject of very many investigations.
Although the number of relevant literature sources is
enormous, in only a few of them proper care is taken with
respect to mathematical consistency of the presented re-
sults. The density operator of an arbitrary system (in-
teracting with the surroundings, or not) should be posi-
tive deﬁnite. This can be ensured only by the carefully
taken and properly conducted limiting procedures. It is
not our aim to review these rigorous mathematical tech-
niques such as weak coupling (or van Hove method) [12],
singular coupling [13] or low density limit [14], we refer
the reader to [5] for a survey of the subject.

We shall brieﬂy discuss only the last of the mentioned
limiting procedures – the low density limit which is de-
signed specially for the description of a quantum system
interacting collisionally with a low density perturber gas.
The underlying physical assumptions are that only bi-
nary collisions are of importance and that the duration
of the collision is much shorter than the mean free-ﬂight
time (this latter condition is the essence of the so-called
impact approximation). The reasoning leading to spe-
ciﬁc form of the collision kernels is thus, as follows. Let
us temporarily assume that the considered active atom
is conﬁned within a ﬁnite volume V and, therefore, is
described by discrete states | ~v, j i with discrete veloci-
ties and with quantum number j denoting its internal
state (note that j may serve as a multiindex consisting
of several quantum numbers). These states span certain
Hilbert space, which by an introduction of an energy cut-
oﬀ can be made ﬁnite dimensional. Let us say that N is
the (ﬁnite) number of the basis vectors | ~v, j i. Then, we
can use the completely positive generator obtained for
a N -state quantum system interacting with dilute gas
of perturbers in the low density limit [14]. Finally, one
takes the density operator which is partially diagonal in
velocities, removes the energy cut-oﬀ and takes the limit
V −→ ∞ (a kind of a thermodynamic limit). Thus one
arrives at the master equation which formally coincides
with Eq.(16). The discussed procedure allows us to as-
sign concrete meaning to all the terms which appear in
the master equation.

The resulting matrix Kab(~v ← ~v′) is block-diagonal due

For purposes of the further discussion it is convenient
to express matrix Kab(~v ← ~v′) by standard scatter-

IV. BLOCH-BOLTZMANN EQUATIONS

A.

Introductory remarks

Our considerations presented in previous sections can
be applied to multilevel atoms with complex internal
structure. This is done by a suitable deﬁnition of op-
erators Sa introduced in Eq.(18). Such a choice also
speciﬁes the form of the collision kernels. We shall, how-
ever, illustrate the general approach by its application
to a two-level atom which is a typical model for many
quantum-optical phenomena. The resulting equations
are, as we already mentioned, called Bloch-Boltzmann
equations. In this case, the space H~v of an atom having
velocity ~v is isomorphic with C2. We denote the ground
state by | 1 i and the excited state by | 2 i. Taking them to
form a basis in H~v, we adopt the following identiﬁcations

| 1 i =

2×2 matrices. As a basis in the operator space we choose
following four operators (pseudospin matrices)

what is in accord with notation introduced in (25). We
note, that the Hamiltonian must be Hermitian, which im-
plies that functions h1(~v), h2(~v) are real, while h3(~v) =
4(~v). Density operator ρ(~v) can be expanded exactly in
h∗
the same manner. To ﬁx the notation and terminology
we, therefore, write

ρ(~v) = ρ11(~v)| 1 ih 1 | + ρ12(~v)| 1 ih 2 |

+ρ21(~v)| 2 ih 1 | + ρ22(~v)| 2 ih 2 |

= ρ1(~v)S1 + ρ2(~v)S2

+ρ3(~v)S3 + ρ4(~v)S4.

(28)

Hence, we can identify the matrix elements

ρ1(~v) = ρ11(~v),
ρ3(~v) = ρ21(~v),

ρ2(~v) = ρ22(~v),
ρ4(~v) = ρ12(~v),

(29a)
(29b)

where the ﬁrst row gives the populations, while the sec-
ond one – coherences, which specify the physical meaning
of the matrix elements of the considered density operator.
Finally, we note that relation (17) restricts the general

form of the hamiltonian (27) to h3 = h4 = 0, that is to

(30)

where Ej = ~ωj, (j = 1, 2), are the eigenenergies of the
corresponding levels of the active atom. Furthermore,
it is straightforward to see that operators Sa deﬁned in
(25) satisfy relations (18) with hamiltonian (30). The
eigenvalue Ω1 = Ω2 = 0 is doubly degenerate, while Ω3 =
ω21, and Ω4 = −ω21 (where ~ω21 = ~(ω2 − ω1) > 0, is
the energy diﬀerence between two atomic levels).

B. General form of Bloch-Boltzmann equations

Next step of our derivation consists in the expansion
of the density operator of a two-level atom according to
Eq.(28). Doing so in the both sides of Eq.(16) we then
perform all the necessary operator computations. As a
result we arrive at the following set of equations for each
matrix element (29) of the density operator

This set of equations is the most general one, describing
the evolution of active atoms (within a two-level model)
due to the interaction with environment – collisions with
the perturber atoms. Since these equations are derived
directly from the general ME which preserves the pos-
itivity of the reduced density operator of A atoms, we
may be certain that this property is unchanged.

The obtained BBE are somewhat simpler if we take
into account the hamiltonian (30). The ﬁrst lines of
Eqs.(31a) and (31b) disappear, while the ﬁrst lines of
Eqs.(31c) and (31d) become −iω21ρ3(~v) and iω21ρ4(~v),
respectively.
In the next subsections we will brieﬂy
present some frequently used approximations which al-
low some simpliﬁcations of the general form (31) with
the ﬁrst lines modiﬁed, as it was just discussed. We will

ﬁrst consider the so-called secular approximation and af-
terwards we will assume that inelastic collisions can be
neglected. However, it seems that the sequence of these
approximations is irrelevant and that each of them can
be used independently of the other one.

C. Bloch-Boltzmann equations and secular
approximation

Secular approximation is recognized as a useful tool in

manifold of physical systems.
optical problems is thoroughly discussed by Cohen-
Tannoudji [3] and by Puri [4]. The essence of this ap-

proximation can, in the present context, be summarized
as follows. When the oﬀ-diagonal terms in the Hamilto-
nian (27) are much smaller (or simply negligible) as com-
pared to the diagonal ones, the populations and the co-
herences may be approximately decoupled. In the other
words, under the secular approximation, the populations
are coupled only to populations, while each of the coher-

ences is coupled only to itself. So far, we have considered
active atoms which are not subjected to any other in-
teractions apart from the collisions. Since we have taken
the hamiltonian (30), the secular approximation is clearly
justiﬁed, which entails considerable simpliﬁcation of the
general Bloch-Boltzmann equations. Thus, we obtain

It should be noted, that if the active atoms are also irra-
diated by incident radiation the Hamiltonian (30) will be
modiﬁed by the suitable coupling terms. Moreover, one
has also to account for spontaneous emission, i.e., for the
coupling to the vacuum ﬁeld. This would lead to the ap-
pearance of additional terms describing radiative eﬀects.
In such a case the validity of the secular approximation
must be separately investigated.

experiments are of the order of several hundred kelvins,
the energy available during the collision is by two orders
of magnitude smaller than the typical separation of the
levels of the active atom. Hence, the probability that
the collision would excite or deexcite the active atom is
negligible. This means that the inelastic collisions can
be left out of the picture. Inspection of Eqs.(31) or (32)
tells us that relations

The energy transfer during the typical collision be-

are equivalent to neglecting the inelastic collisions. Em-

used in the literature.

V. DISCUSSION

A. Review of the results known from literature

cerned with a simple two-level atom suﬀering elastic colli-
sions, we will restrict our attention only to such a model.
The derivation of the collisional terms, as discussed in
[1] is performed by means of a truncation of the BBGKY
hierarchy of equations of motion to one- and two-particle
density operators. Assuming that the active atoms and
perturbers are uncorrelated for time t → −∞, and treat-
ing their translational motion quasi classically, one then
arrives at the kinetic equation which governs the evolu-
tion of the matrix elements of the density operator due
to collisions. This equation is of the general form

The theoretical models employed to describe atomic
A − P collisions which tend to thermalize the velocity
states of active atoms are usually based on the suit-
able adaptation of the quantum-mechanical, or classical
Boltzmann equation. The most extensive and thorough
review of such an approach is given in a monograph by
Rautian and Shalagin [1]. These authors present quite
general formalism which can be applied to describe var-
ious physical situations concerning active atoms with
complex, multilevel structure of degenerate energy eigen-
states. Moreover, general expressions can also treat both
elastic and inelastic collisions. Since we are mainly con-

for i, j = 1, 2. It is valid for binary elastic collisions in
the impact approximation and for perturbers with ho-
mogeneous spatial distribution. The collisional kernel
Wij(~v ← ~v′) following from quantum-mechanical Boltz-
mann equation is expressed via the corresponding scat-
tering amplitudes (see [1], Eq.(2.147))

The notation employed here is exactly the same as that

so it is given by the diﬀerence between the scattering
amplitudes corresponding to forward scattering.

The diagonal kernels Wii(~v ← ~v′) and rates γii are
seen to be real and can be thought of to possess classical
limits. Eq.(35) multiplied by d~v (for i = j) represents
the collisional diﬀusion out of and the ﬂow into veloc-
ity interval (~v, ~v + d~v) due to scattering of active atoms
in | i i state. Therefore, integral term in Eq.(35) is the
gain one and it gives the number of active atoms in state
| i i which change velocity from ~v′ before, to ~v after the
collision. Hence, the collision kernels Wii(~v ← ~v′) are
measures of transition probabilities from ~v′ to ~v velocity
groups. The rates γii(~v) enter the loss terms, and give
the number of atoms in the state | i i escaping from ve-

locity interval (~v, ~v + d~v) to any other one. Let us note
that γii(~v) can be also viewed as the collision frequency
and its inverse τii(~v) = 1/γii(~v) can be interpreted as
the average time between collisions. Finally, it is worth
noting that the given probabilistic interpretation of the
kernel and frequency is fully consistent with the relation

γii(~v) =

d~v1 Wii(~v ← ~v′),

(38)

Z

which reﬂects the requirement of the particle number
conservation and follows from Eqs.(36) and (37) by the
application of the optical theorem.

The quantum-mechanical (linear) Boltzmann equation
(35) speciﬁes the time evolution not only of the diagonal
elements of the density operator, but also of the coher-
ences – the oﬀ-diagonal ones, that is for i 6= j. In such
a case, neither the kernels Wij (~v ← ~v′) nor the rates γij
have probabilistic interpretation. The kinetic equation

The collisional rate is split into two terms: γ(ph)
(~v)
being called the ”phase-changing” rate, while γ(vc)
(~v)
is the ”velocity changing” one [16]. The former rate,
γ(ph)
(~v), is the one usually associated with the homo-
ij
geneous linewidth which appears in the typical pressure
broadening theories of the atomic spectral lineshape. It
can be argued [16] that, in many practical applications,
γ(ph)
ij may be treated as velocity independent (although
this dependence entails interesting correlations between
Doppler and power broadening). Two last terms in (39)
describe velocity changing collisions and are frequently
omitted from the equations of motion of density oper-
ator. There are some arguments [16] justifying such an
omission. However, these arguments are somewhat vague
and heuristic, and according to our knowledge, there is
no clear-cut and generally accepted criterion which speci-
ﬁes when one is allowed to drop out the velocity changing
terms in (39).

In many theoretical approaches used to describe the
spectroscopical experiments the semiclassical model is
thought to be suﬃcient. In such a case, the motion of
atoms is taken to be purely classical, while the internal
degrees of freedom are treated quantum-mechanically.
Then, the classical kinetic theory is quite appropriate for
determination of velocity distributions of not too dense
gases. The discussed gas is then considered as a mixture
of the following species: perturbers, active atoms in the
ground state and atoms in the excited state. Since the
perturbers are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium, one
can invoke linear Boltzmann equation [17] and derive ki-
netic equation for classical velocity distributions Fj(~v)
which are (up to a normalization constant) proportional
to the probability of an active atom being in state | j i
and possessing velocity ~v, that is, to populations ρii(~v).
The resulting kinetic equation has the form identical to
diagonal equations (35). The classical kernel for an active
atom in state | j i is then

These quantities also satisfy requirement (38) and have
the discussed probabilistic interpretation. The collisional

10

(classical, center-of-mass) cross sections dσj/dΩ may ob-
viously be viewed as classical counterparts of scattering
amplitudes appearing in ”diagonal” deﬁnitions (36) and
(37). There are no classical analogs of coherences, so
there is no classical argument leading to coherence ker-
nels and rates. Atomic coherences describe the correla-
tions between the internal quantum states of active atoms
and usually may be left out of the classical picture.

Kinetic equations (35) or their semiclassical counter-
parts, is then used as an augmentations of the equations
of motion describing the radiative eﬀects occurring due
to the coupling of the active atoms with the incident
(laser) radiation. Such an approach is frequently used in
the studies light-induced kinetic eﬀects in gases [18, 19]
and of other phenomena of the spectroscopic nature in
which atom-atom collisions are of importance (e.g. [20]).
However, computation of the collision kernels and rates
either in quantum-mechanical or in classical case is usu-
ally extremely diﬃcult, if at all possible. Calculations
of the scattering amplitudes (or equivalently of the cross
sections) require the knowledge of interatomic potentials.
Such potentials are either not known, or given only in the
numerical form. Therefore, many authors employ model
kernels and rates which allow analytical computations.
The most popularly used models are strong collision one
and the Keilson-Storer model. There are also other pos-
sibilities connected with the notion of collision operators.
These models and concepts are reviewed elsewhere, see
for example [1, 21, 22] and references given therein.

B. Comparison to our results

We are now in position to compare our results with
those above presented which are known from literature.
Although we focus our attention on the Bloch-Boltzmann
equations, i.e., on those for a two-level atom, it seems
that the generalizations to more complex atomic struc-
tures are rather straightforward.

Adopting the operator basis (25) with the hamiltonian
(27) and leaving the inelastic collisions out of the picture,
which corresponds to putting T3(~vr ← ~v′
r) = T4(~vr ←
~v′
r) = 0, we arrive at the BBE exactly as in Eqs.(34).
Since we have an identiﬁcation (29) we can conclude that
our collision kernels Kab(~v ← ~v′) coincide with Wij(~v ←
~v′), for a = i and b = j, they are given by the same
formulas, Eqs.(19) or (22) and (36), respectively. Hence,
the comments given after Eq.(37) apply to population
kernels Wii(~v ← ~v′) as well as to Kaa(~v ← ~v′) for i =
a = 1, 2,

The situation is, however, much diﬀerent with respect
to our collisional rates γ∗
ab as compared to literature ones
γij. First of all, we note that in our case the rates γ∗
ab
are deﬁned as integrals over kernels Kab(~v ← ~v′) and fol-
low quite naturally from the general formalism. Hence,
γ∗
ab are given as integrals over the products of scattering
amplitudes. The rates γij from literature are given by
diﬀerences of forward scattering amplitudes, see Eq.(37).

The derivation and the limiting procedures, as presented
by Rautian and Shalagin, which lead to the expression
(37) seem to lack mathematical rigor and their physical
basis seems to us to be not fully clear. Luckily, the appli-
cation of the optical theorem entails correct relation (38)
which, on the other hand, is an automatic consequence
of our formalism.

Secondly, as it follows from the very structure of our
theory, Bloch-Boltzmann equations for coherences, that
is Eqs. (34c) and (34d) contain the coherence collisional
rate, which is in our case, of the form

Γ12(~v) = Γ21(~v) = 1
2

11(~v) + γ∗
γ∗
h

22(~v)
i

.

(42)

Such a quantity does not appear in the kinetic equation
approach. The presence of Γ12 is connected with the em-
ployed method which ensures the positivity of the atomic
density operator. The kinetic equation method which
provides coherence rate γ12(~v) cannot, therefore, guaran-
tee that the computed density operator will be positively
deﬁned, as it always should be.

Moreover, the rate Γ12(~v) is speciﬁed only by col-
lision kernels K11(~v ← ~v′) and K22(~v ← ~v′) which
may be called ”population” ones. Γ12(~v) is, thus, in-
dependent of the coherence kernel K12(~v ← ~v′) which
enters Eqs.(34) separately. Only if inelastic collisions
are taken into account, that is if the scattering ampli-
r) and f4(~vr ← ~v′
tudes f3(~vr ← ~v′
r) are nonzero, the
oﬀ-diagonal rates γ∗
ab may appear in Bloch-Boltzmann
equations. This is clearly seen by inspection of Eqs.(31)
which are the most general ones. We are of the opin-
ion that our Γ12(~v) should be associated with homo-
geneous linewidth, usually connected with the so-called
”phase-changing” collisions. Having in view the relation
between Γ12 and population collision kernels, we sup-
port the opinion of Rautian and Shalagin ([1], p.66), that
any attempts to distinguish ”phase-changing collisions”,
”velocity-changing collisions” or any other special types
of collisions, are futile and physically misleading. Thus,

11

it also seems that attempts to split the collisional rate as
in Eq.(39) are arbitrary and not really justiﬁed.

Furthermore, if we assume that the coherence kernel
K12(~v ← ~v′) can be neglected (putting aside the ques-
tion of justiﬁcation of such an approximation) the rate
Γ12(~v) appears naturally in our formalism. There is no
need to invoke any additional arguments that homoge-
neous linewidth should be present in Bloch-Boltzmann
equations, even when the kernel K12(~v ← ~v′) is absent.
This conclusion remains valid, also in the case we adopt
semiclassical picture taking classical expressions (41) and
(40) for γ∗

aa and Kaa(~v ← ~v′).

Finally, we note that relation (38) which is the require-
ment of particle number conservation follows automati-
cally from our derivation, as it is reﬂected by expression
(15). This is especially important in various approximate
approaches to estimate the collision kernels. In such ap-
proximations the optical theorem may not hold, and thus
(38) may also not hold. The kinetic equation method
may not ensure the particle number conservation while
our approach clearly does, even if some approximation
are made.

We conclude this work, by saying that we believe that
the proper form of the Bloch-Boltzmann equations is ex-
pressed by the set (34) with collision kernels deﬁned by
formula (19) or (22) and with collision rates connected
to kernels by relation (15). The proposed proper form of
BBE ensures that the required positivity of the atomic
density operator is preserved. Moreover, we believe that
the presented interpretation of the structure and terms
of BBE will appear useful in future applications and in
further research.

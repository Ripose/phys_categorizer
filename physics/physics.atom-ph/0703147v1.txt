High-harmonic generation from muonic atoms exposed to intense laser ﬁelds is considered. Our
particular interest lies in eﬀects arising from the ﬁnite nuclear mass and size. We numerically perform
a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the muon-nucleus dynamics by employing modiﬁed soft-
core and hard-core potentials. It is shown that the position of the high-energy cutoﬀ of the harmonic
spectrum depends on the nuclear mass, while the height of the spectral plateau is sensitive to the
nuclear radius. We also demonstrate that γ-ray harmonics can be generated from muonic atoms in
ultrastrong VUV ﬁelds, which have potential to induce photo-nuclear reactions.

Muonic atoms have ever since been useful tools for nu-
clear spectroscopy employing atomic-physics techniques.
Due to the large muon mass and the correspondingly
small Bohr radius, the muonic wave function has a large
overlap with the nucleus and thus eﬀectively probes its
structural features, such as ﬁnite size, deformation, sur-
face thickness, or polarization [1]. Muonic atoms also
play an important role as catalysts for nuclear fusion [2].
On the other hand, there is the steadily growing ﬁeld
of laser-matter interactions. While traditionally deal-
ing with the atomic or molecular response to an exter-
nal light wave, it has recently widened to include also,
among other new directions,
laser-nuclear physics [3].
With laser-heated clusters and plasmas, nuclear ﬁssion
[4] and fusion [5] have been realized as well as neutron
production in (p,n) or (d,n) reactions [6]. By virtue of
the interaction with an applied laser ﬁeld, high-precision
experiments have been able to monitor ultrafast vibra-
tions of the nuclei in diatomic molecules [7]. The rapid
progress in laser technology even opens prospects for nu-
clear quantum optics via direct laser-nucleus coupling [8].
Against this background, the combination of muonic
atoms with laser ﬁelds in order to dynamically probe nu-
clear properties by the laser-driven muon appears very
promising. The information on the nucleus, dynami-
cally revealed by laser assistance, can in principle comple-
ment the knowledge gained from ﬁeld-free spectroscopy
of muonic atoms. Modiﬁcations of muon-catalyzed fu-
sion from a muonic D+
2 molecule in the presence of a
superintense laser ﬁeld have recently been addressed [9].
We note that on the typical time scale of strong laser
pulses (τ ∼ fs−ns) muonic atoms and molecules may be
considered as stable since the muon lifetime is 2.2 µs.

In this Letter, high-harmonic generation (HHG) [10]
from muonic hydrogen isotopes in strong laser ﬁelds is
studied. We demonstrate nuclear signatures arising from
the ﬁnite nuclear mass and size in the radiation emitted
by the muonic charge cloud, which oscillates across the
nucleus under the inﬂuence of the laser ﬁeld. The rela-
tive motion of the muon and the nucleus is taken into ac-
count. In the ground state of muonic hydrogen, the muon

is bound by 2.5 keV and experiences an electric ﬁeld
strength of 1.8×1014 V/cm corresponding to the intensity
4.2×1025 W/cm2. It is instructive to compare these num-
bers with the parameters of the most advanced present-
day and near-future laser sources.
In the optical and
near-infrared frequency range (ℏω ∼ 1 eV), the next gen-
eration of high-power lasers will reach the intensity level
of 1023 W/cm2 [11]. At VUV frequencies (ℏω ∼ 10 − 100
eV) a record intensity of almost 1016 W/cm2 has recently
been achieved at the FLASH facility (DESY, Germany)
with a free-electron laser [12]. Near-future upgrades of
such machines will generate x-ray beams (ℏω ∼ 1 − 10
keV) with peak intensities close to 1020 W/cm2. There
are also eﬀorts to produce ultrashort, high-frequency ra-
diation (ℏω ∼ 10 − 1000 eV) from plasma surface har-
monics where, due to high conversion eﬃciency, consid-
erably higher intensities might be reachable [13]. With
these high-intensity and/or high-frequency sources of co-
herent radiation it will become possible to inﬂuence the
dynamics of (light) muonic atoms. As an example, we
investigate high-harmonic emission from muonic hydro-
gen and deuterium in intense VUV laser ﬁelds. Our nu-
merical calculations reveal pronounced diﬀerences in the
HHG spectrum when changing the nuclear mass and size
accordingly.

We consider muonic quantum dynamics in the non-
relativistic regime described by the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE). Due to the large muon
mass, the nucleus cannot be treated as an inﬁnitely
heavy particle and its motion must be taken into account.
Within the dipole approximation for the laser ﬁeld, the
two-particle TDSE separates into center-of-mass and rel-
ative motion. By employing a one-dimensional (1D)
hydrogen-like model atom (to be justiﬁed below), the
center of mass evolves in time according to

with the muonic, nuclear, total and reduced masses mµ,

center-of-mass and relative coordinates X and x, cor-
responding momentum operators P = −iℏ∂/∂X and
p = −iℏ∂/∂x, nuclear charge number Z, nuclear poten-
tial V (x) and laser electric ﬁeld E(t). Equation (1) is the
non-relativistic Volkov equation for a particle of charge
(Z − 1)e and mass M . In the present paper we restrict
ourselves to the case Z = 1 as the required laser inten-
sities are the smallest then, while the eﬀects of interest
are expected to be appreciable. Note that throughout
the nuclear chart the largest relative diﬀerence among
isotopes, both in mass and charge radius, exists between
hydrogen nuclei. In this situation, Eq. (1) describes free
motion of the center-of-mass coordinate which does not
generate radiation and can be ignored. The laser ﬁeld
solely couples to the relative coordinate. For Z = 1,
Eq. (2) is reduced to the usual Schr¨odinger equation for
a single particle of charge −e and mass mr in the com-
bined ﬁelds of a laser and a nucleus. By applying the
standard scaling transformation, one can recast Eq. (2)
into a form that describes an ordinary (i.e. electronic)
hydrogen atom in a scaled laser ﬁeld. The scaled laser
frequency and ﬁeld strength are given by [9]

′

;

′

E

(3)

where ρ ≡ me/mr, with the electron mass me. That is,
a muonic hydrogen atom in a laser ﬁeld with parameters
E, ω behaves like an ordinary hydrogen atom in a ﬁeld
with E′, ω′ given by Eq. (3), provided that the Coulomb
potential V (x) arises from a pointlike nucleus. The scal-
ing procedure, however, does not account for nuclear pa-
rameters like, e.g., the ﬁnite nuclear size. Evidently,
when the transition from a muonic to an ordinary hy-
drogen atom is performed, the nuclear radius is not to
be scaled but remains ﬁxed. Hence, for atomic systems
where nuclear properties play a role, not all physical in-
formation can be obtained via scaling. Below we show
results which display the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear
size on the process of HHG.

We solve the TDSE in Eq. (2) numerically by making
use of the Crank-Nicolson time-propagation scheme. The
laser ﬁeld is always chosen as a 5-cycle pulse of trape-
zoidal envelope comprising one cycle for linear turn-on
and turn-oﬀ each. The harmonic spectrum is obtained by
taking the Fourier transform of the dipole acceleration.
With regard to the 1D approximation in Eqs. (1,2) we
note that, in general, 1D models are known to retain the
essential physical features of nonrelativistic laser-atom

interaction for linearly polarized ﬁelds [14]; therefore,
these models are widely used [15]. Furthermore, in our
case the 1D numerics still is a non-trivial task because of
the ﬁne grid spacing required to resolve the nuclear ex-
tension and the non-standard laser parameters employed.
As regards ordinary atoms, the latter would correspond
to intense ﬁelds in the far-infrared. Eventually, we stress
that the goal of this paper is to reveal relative diﬀerences
between physical observables which typically are less sen-
sitive to model assumptions than absolute numbers.

As the conversion eﬃciency of HHG is rather low, it
generally is desirable to maximize the harmonic signal
strength. In the present case, the optimization is of par-
ticular importance as the target density is low. Eﬃcient
HHG requires both eﬃcient ionization and recombina-
tion. The former is guaranteed if the laser peak ﬁeld
strength lies just below the border of over-barrier ion-
ization (OBI) where the Coulomb barrier is completely
suppressed by the laser ﬁeld, i.e.

corresponding to the intensity I OBI ≈ 1.6 × 1023 W/cm2.
Here, α ≈ 1/137 denotes the ﬁne-structure constant.
Eﬃcient recombination is ensured if the magnetic drift
along the laser propagation direction is negligibly small,
which limits the relativistic parameter to [16]

with the atomic ionization potential Ip. We note that
condition (5) also implies applicability of the dipole ap-
proximation. The lowest frequency which simultaneously
satisﬁes Eqs. (4) and (5) lies in the VUV range and corre-
sponds to ~ω ≈ 27 eV. At this value, the harmonic radi-
ation has a remarkable maximum energy of Ec ≈ 0.55
MeV. Hence, muonic atoms are also promising candi-
dates for the generation of hard x-rays which might be
employed to trigger photo-nuclear reactions.

To express the possible eﬀects due to the ﬁnite nuclear
mass appearing in HHG spectra of laser-driven muonic
hydrogen isotopes, we introduce the usual soft-core po-
tential [14]

FIG. 1: (color online). HHG spectra calculated with the soft-
core potential (6). The black and grey (red) lines represent
the spectrum for muonic hydrogen and deuterium, respec-
tively. The laser parameters are I = 1.05 × 1023 W/cm2 and
ℏω = 59 eV.

Figure 1 shows the HHG spectra for muonic hydrogen
and deuterium in an ultra-strong VUV ﬁeld of the fre-
quency ℏω = 59 eV and the intensity I = 1.05 × 1023
W/cm2. The spectrum of hydrogen is enhanced and fur-
ther extends by about 60 harmonics. The reason for
the spectral enhancement is that the eﬀective particle
of the proton-muon system experiences stronger acceler-
ation since it has a smaller reduced mass. The diﬀerence
in the cutoﬀ position Ec = Ip + 3.17Up [10] is also caused
by the reduced mass which enters the ponderomotive en-
ergy

For the chosen laser parameters we obtain Up ≫ Ip so
that the smaller reduced mass leads to a higher cutoﬀ
energy. Note that in a situation where Up ≪ Ip, the
relative order of the cutoﬀ positions would be reversed.
Furthermore, we point out that the pondermotive energy
in Eq. (7) can be understood as the sum of the pondero-
motive energies of muon and nucleus. As schematically
depicted in Fig. 2, both particles are driven into opposite
directions by the laser ﬁeld and when they recollide their
kinetic energies add up. In this picture the higher cut-
oﬀ energy of the hydrogen atom arises from the larger
ponderomotive energy of the proton as compared to the
deuteron. Note that the phenomenon that both atomic
constituents are driven into opposite directions is most
pronounced for positronium, the bound state of an elec-
tron and positron [17]. We also observe a few kinks in
the spectra of Fig. 1. This multiplateau structure is typ-
ical of the interaction regime where ξ ∼ 0.1 (in our case
ξ ≈ 0.04) [10].

At the chosen frequency, the laser intensity assumed
in Fig. 1 cannot be attained by present-day technology
in the laboratory. One might, however, employ a rela-

3

tivistic beam of muonic atoms counter-propagating the
laser beam [18]. Then, via the relativistic Doppler shift,
the parameters of Fig. 1 can be reached with the help
of an intense optical laser pulse of ~ω ≈ 1.5 eV and
I ≈ 6.5 × 1019 W/cm2 at an atomic Lorentz factor of
γ ≈ 20. In their rest frame, the atoms would then expe-
rience the laser parameters of Fig. 1. For muonic hydro-
gen atoms carrying zero charge, the acceleration cannot
directly be accomplished, though. But one could accel-
erate muons and protons/deuterons separately and let
them combine in a merged beams setup. A similar way of
producing positronium atoms at γ ≈ 20 via acceleration
of negative positronium ions has been proposed recently
[19].

Muonic Hydrogen

Muonic Deuterium

FIG. 2: Schematic diagram of the motion of the nucleus (on
the left) and the muon (on the right) in muonic hydrogen and
deuterium in the presence of a laser ﬁeld polarized in horizon-
tal direction. The oscillation amplitudes are not scaled.

To express the possible eﬀects due to the ﬁnite nuclear
size appearing in HHG spectra of laser-driven muonic
hydrogen isotopes, we need a potential which explicitly
takes the nuclear radius into account. We make use of the
nuclear drop model, considering the nucleus as a sphere
of uniform charge density within the nuclear radius R,
and employ the potential:

We note that the lowest lying atomic state of this poten-
tial is unphysical as its binding energy becomes inﬁnite
in the limit R → 0 [20]. Therefore, in accordance with
common practice [20, 21, 22], we start our calculation
from the ﬁrst excited state which has the correct hydro-
genic binding energy. Figure 3 shows the HHG spectra
obtained from the potential (8) for muonic hydrogen and
deuterium. The proton and deuteron charge radii are
Rp ≈ 0.875 fm and Rd ≈ 2.139 fm [23].
In order to
compensate for the nuclear mass eﬀect, we apply accord-
ingly scaled frequencies and intensities with ω ∝ mr and
I ∝ m4
r [cf. Eq. (3)] so that the cutoﬀ positions of both
spectra coincide. We note that the overall shape of the
harmonic response diﬀers from that shown in Fig. 1 due
to the diﬀerent potentials employed. In particular, a dip
can be seen at low harmonics (nℏω ∼ Ip) followed by a
rising plateau region. A similar feature was found in [24]
and attributed to the behavior of non-tunneling harmon-
ics in very steep potentials. More important with regard

FIG. 3: (color online). HHG spectra calculated with the hard-
core potential (8). The black line represents the spectrum for
muonic hydrogen at the laser parameters I H = 1.05 × 1023
W/cm2 and ℏωH = 59 eV. The grey (red) line represents the
spectrum for muonic deuterium at the correspondingly scaled
laser parameters I D = 1.30 × 1023 W/cm2 and ℏωD = 62 eV.
The inset shows a blow-up of the cutoﬀ region on a linear
scale, with the black line dashed for better visibility.

to the present study is, however, that the harmonic sig-
nal from muonic hydrogen is larger (by about 50 % in
the cutoﬀ region) than that from deuterium. The reason
is that a smaller nuclear radius increases the steepness
of the potential near the origin, leading to more violent
acceleration and thus to enhanced harmonic emission.
With regard to ordinary atoms it has been noticed be-
fore that the analytic behavior of the binding potential
near the origin is of great importance for the HHG pro-
cess [22]; according to Ehrenfest’s theorem, the atomic
dipole is accelerated by the potential gradient which is
largest in this region. In the present situation we there-
fore ﬁnd that the plateau height of HHG spectra from
muonic atoms is sensitive to the ﬁnite nuclear size.

In conclusion, we have found characteristic nuclear
signatures in the harmonic response of strongly laser-
driven muonic hydrogen and deuterium atoms. For deu-
terium, due to the larger nuclear mass and size, both
the harmonic cutoﬀ and the plateau height are signif-
icantly reduced.
It was also shown that high-energy
photons in the MeV regime can be generated which are
capable of nuclear excitation. Our results could ex-
perimentally be tested by virtue of near-future technol-
ogy, i.e. by employing intense high-frequency radiation
from free-electron lasers or plasma surface harmonics
or, alternatively, by combining radiation from existing
high-power near-optical laser systems with a relativis-
tic atomic beam. The present study demonstrates that
muonic atoms in strong laser ﬁelds can be utilized to dy-
namically gain structure information on nuclear ground
states. It also oﬀers the prospect of performing pump-
probe experiments on excited nuclear levels since the pe-
riodically driven muon can excite the nucleus during one

4

of the encounters and afterwards probe the excited state
and its deexcitation mechanism.

Abstract

Expressions for the eﬀective Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Hamiltonian

due to self-energy screening (self-energy correction to the electron-electron

interaction) are presented. We use the method of the two-time Green’s func-

tion, which handles quasidegenerate atomic states. From these expression one

can evaluate energy corrections to, e.g., 1s2p 3P1 and 1s2p 1P1 in helium and

two-electron ions, to all orders in Zα.

In the last ten years, experiments in the spectroscopy of helium [1–5] have become

two orders of magnitude more precise than the best theoretical energy level calculations

available (see, e.g., Refs. [6,7] and references therein). Several experiments are now focusing

on Helium and heliumlike ions 1s2p 3PJ ﬁne structure [8–12], with the aim of providing a

new determination of the ﬁne structure constant and of checking higher-order eﬀects in the

calculations.

In this case the theory is again a limiting factor.

In this context a direct

determination of all α2 contributions to all order in Zα is necessary to improve reliability

and accuracy of theoretical calculations (α being the ﬁne structure constant, and Z the

charge of the nucleus).

A diﬃculty in the study of the (1s2p1/2)1 and (1s2p3/2)1 levels is that they are quaside-

generate for low and middle Z ions [13]; this precludes the use of the Gell-Man–Low and

Sucher method [14,15] to evaluate QED energy shifts of atomic levels. In fact, this method

has two important drawbacks:

it does not handle quasidegenerate energy levels, and it

leads to a diﬃcult renormalization procedure when applied to degenerate states. (The latter

problem has only been tackled up to second-order in α [16,17].)

We use the method of the two-time Green’s function [18–20], rigorously derived from

QED (for the most detailed description of this method, see [21]). To the best of our knowl-

edge, only the method recently proposed by Lindgren [22], closely modeled to multireference-

state Many-body perturbation techniques, is designed to work for quasidegenerate states.

We evaluate the contribution of the screened self-energy diagrams

to quasidegenerate energy levels in heliumlike ions. Our results can be easily extended to

ions with more than two electrons along lines similar to those found in [23].

First approximate evaluations of the contribution of these diagrams for isolated states

in two- and three-electron ions were performed in Refs. [24–27]. Accurate calculations from

the ﬁrst principles of QED were accomplished in Refs. [28–30] for the ground state of heli-

umlike ions and in Refs. [31,32] for the 2s and 2p1/2 states of lithiumlike ions. The other

2

two α2 corrections to the electron-electron interaction have also been calculated for isolated

states in two- and three-electron ions: the vacuum-polarization screening [13,29,30,33,34],

and the two-photon exchange diagrams [35–38].

In [13], the vacuum polarization screen-

ing for quasidegenerate states of heliumlike ions was evaluated as well. Some results for

the direct contribution of the self-energy correction to the Coulomb interaction are also

available [24,39].

As depicted in diagrams (1), the interaction between the two electrons through photons

is treated perturbatively. On the contrary, the binding to the nucleus is included non-

perturbatively in the method we use, since the corresponding coupling constant is Zα. Such

a treatment is obviously mandatory for highly-charged ions. Furthermore, it allows one to

compare non-perturbative (in Zα) results to (semi-)analytic expansions in Zα (see [40] for

a review).

We derive the eﬀective (ﬁnite-sized) matrix hamiltonian H, whose eigenvalues give the

contribution of QED to a group of energy levels [23]. The diagonal entries of the hamilto-

nian that we evaluate correctly reproduce previous expressions of the screened self-energy,

while the new, non-diagonal entries that we derive allow one to obtain a second-order QED

correction to quasidegenerate or degenerate energy levels.

Relativistic units ¯h = c = 1 are used throughout this paper.

If we have s quasidegenerate energy levels E(0)

1...s, the eﬀective hamiltonian H is an s

matrix restricted to these levels [23]. Let us introduce some notations in order to express

this hamiltonian. The second-order contribution H (2) to this hamiltonian H = H (0) + H (1) +

H (2) + . . . is constructed from a projection matrix P and an energy matrix K [23]:

atomic levels under consideration, and where Γ is a contour that encloses each of the Dirac

atomic energy levels with a positive orientation [23].

We directly evaluate the hamiltonian matrix elements of Eq. (2) between states of dif-

ferent energies E(0)

n and E(0)

n′ , and put them in a form that readily displays the limiting case

of identical energies; we checked by a direct calculation of the diagonal matrix elements

that they can be obtained from non-diagonal elements H (2)

nn′ by taking the formal limit

E(0)

n →

E(0)

n′ . All the subsequent derivations of H (2)

nn′ will thus be done with E(0)
n 6

= E(0)
n′ .

The ﬁrst diagram of (1) appears only in the second-order matrices K (2) and P (2) in Eq.

(2). As usual, we must calculate a reducible and an irreducible contribution; as can be

seen in subsequent calculations, it turns out that the correct extension of these notions to

quasidegenerate states is the following: in the ﬁrst diagram of Eq. (1), the contribution of

intermediate electrons with a Dirac energy εk such that εk + εn′
P ′

coincides with one of

(2)

the s energy levels under consideration and must be separated out from the contribution

of the other intermediate electron states; the ﬁrst contribution (called reducible) requires a

diﬀerent mathematical treatment from that of the second contribution (called irreducible).

Thus, the irreducible contribution is obtained by summing over almost all electron states

k in the ﬁrst diagram of Eq. (1); we ﬁrst show that it is suﬃcient to remove only one state k

from the sum over states in the ﬁrst diagram of Eq. (1). We see that an intermediate energy

εk +εn′
P ′

(2)

can coincide with an unperturbed atomic levels E(0)

1...s only if the electron k has the

same principal quantum number as the electron n′

P ′(1) on the other side of the self-energy,

because otherwise the total energy εk + εn′
P ′

(2)

would lie largely out of the range spanned by

the unperturbed quasidegenerate energy levels located around E(0)

n′ = εn′
P ′

+ εn′
P ′

.

(2)

(1)

There is an additional selection on the electrons k to be removed: since the total angular

4

momentum, its projection, and parity are conserved by the self-energy operator Σ [Eq.

(6) below], as can be seen by integrating over angles using standard techniques [41], the

contribution of electrons k that do not share the same quantum numbers (κ, m) as the

electron n′

P ′(1) in the ﬁrst diagram of Eq. (1) is exactly zero.

We denote the individual electrons of a state n by n1 and n2, in an order which is arbitrary

but that must remain ﬁxed. With these notations, our evaluation of the irreducible part of

the ﬁrst diagram of (1) to the eﬀective hamiltonian (2) takes a simple form and reads (Dirac

energies are still denoted by εk):

The energy and projection matrices K and P of Eq. (3) have been calculated for the

photon-exchange diagram in [13]; this allows one to evaluate any integral due to the photon

exchange that appears in the eﬀective hamiltonian (2).

In order to derive the contribution of the one-electron self-energy, let us show that

the evaluation of the self-energy contributions to the hamiltonian (2) boils down to the

calculation of contour integrals of the form

1
2πi IΓn

1
2πi IΓn

dE gSE

nn(E) and

dE E gSE

nn(E)

(9)

where gSE

nn(E) are diagonal elements of the self-energy Green’s function; in other words,

the contour Γ that surrounds all the levels in Eq. (3) can be replaced by the contour that

surrounds E(0)

n only, and non-diagonal elements of the self-energy Green’s function are not

relevant. The contour integrals of Eq. (9) have both been evaluated in [32], so that no further

quantity is required in order to obtain the self-energy contribution to the hamiltonian (2).

Let us prove the above statements. As mentioned before, angular momentum conserva-

tions constrain the self-energy operator Σ to be zero between states with diﬀerent angular

6

quantum numbers (κ, m); and since the atomic levels we consider have the same principal

quantum number (they are quasidegenerate), the self-energy Green’s matrix is diagonal:

gSE
nn′(E) = 0 if n

= n′,

(10)

where n and n′ are the sets of quantum numbers of two of the s levels under consideration.

Furthermore, the Green’s function gSE

nn(E) has only one pole inside the integration con-

tour Γ, namely at E = E(0)

n . Therefore, integrating over the full contour Γ in the hamiltonian

(2) amounts to integrate over the contour Γn that surrounds only E(0)

n , since the Green’s

function is analytic inside the contours that encircle the other energies.

We thus see that the contribution of the self-energy to Eq. (2) depends only on contour

integrals of the form (9), which are known analytically [32].

With the help of some published analytical formulas, we obtain the following contribution

of the photon exchange (see Eqs. (27) and (28) in [13]) and of the self-energy (see Eqs. (36)

and (37) in [32]) to the eﬀective hamiltonian (2):

with the same notations as before; the sum is over all pairs of Dirac states.

We thus have obtained the full contribution [Eq. (4) + Eq. (12)+Eq. (13)] of the screened

self-energy diagrams (1) to a ﬁnite-sized eﬀective hamiltonian which acts on a few atomic

energy levels (in the general case: quasidegenerate, fully degenerate or isolated); the eigen-

values of this hamiltonian give the QED prediction for the energy levels. We have also taken

into account the contribution of the ﬁrst-order diagrams (8) to the second-order hamiltonian

(2).

The results presented here extend previous derivations of the screened self-energy con-

tribution to the Lamb shift, which were restricted to the evaluation of the energy shift of

an isolated level. The diagonal terms of the eﬀective hamiltonian that we have evaluated

conﬁrm previously published results. The new, non-diagonal matrix elements of the hamil-

tonian that we obtained allow one to calculate the energy shifts of quasidegenerate levels

and to extend numerical calculations [24,28–31,42] to such levels.

Abstract

We derived the energy gap of a breached pairing superﬂuidity phase of

fermionic atoms in an external magnetic ﬁeld in Feshbach resonance experi-

ments which is determined by the magnetic - ﬁeld detuning from the Feshbach

resonance. We show that a BCS superﬂuid state exists only for the magnetic

- ﬁeld detuning smaller than one critical, and this critical magnetic - ﬁeld

detuning is determined by the equality of the Zeeman energy splitting for the

magnetic - ﬁeld detuning to the energy gap ∆0.

The trapping and cooling of gases with Fermi statistics has become one of the central

areas of research within the ﬁeld of ultracold atomic gases. Much progress has been made

in the achievement of degenerate regimes of trapped atomic Fermi gases [ 1 - 5]. The major

goals of studies of these systems is to observe a transition to a paired - fermion superﬂuid

state. There has been considerable interest in achieving superﬂuidity in an ultracold trapped

Fermi gas in which a Feshbach resonance is used to tune the interatomic attraction by

variation of a magnetic ﬁeld. The interactions which drive the pairing in these gases can be

controlled using a Feshbach resonance, in which a molecular level is Zeeman tuned through

zero binding energy using an external magnetic ﬁeld. Via a Feshbach resonance it is possible

to tune the strength and the sign of the eﬀective interaction between particles. In result,

magnetic - ﬁeld Feshbach resonances provide the means for controlling the strength of cold

atom interactions, characterized s - wave scattering length a, as well as whether they are

eﬀectively repulsive ( a > 0) or attractive ( a < 0 ). Therefore, the tunability of interactions

in fermionic atoms provides a unique possibility to explore the Bose - Einstein condensate

to Bardeen - Cooper -Schriever ( BEC - BCS ) crossover [ 6 - 8 ], an intriguing interplay

between the superﬂuidity of bosons and Cooper pairing of fermions. A Feshbach resonance

oﬀers the unique possibility to study the crossover between situations governed by Bose -

Einstein and Fermi - Dirac statistics. When the scattering length a is positive the atoms pair

in a bound molecular state and these bosonic dimers can form a Bose - Einstein condensate;

when a is negative, one expects the well - known BCS model for superconductivity to be

valid.

On the other hand, recently has been considerable interest in the study of asymmetric

fermionic systems and the possibility of new form of superﬂuidity in this systems. An in-

teresting new phase in Fermi matter, termed as breached pairing state, has been recently

predicted by Liu and Wilczek [9]. This pairing phenomenon gives rise to a superﬂuidity

having superﬂuid and normal Fermi liquid components simultaneously. The pairing be-

tween fermions with diﬀerent Fermi momenta in asymmetric fermion systems produces a

state with coexisting superﬂuid and normal ﬂuids. Possible realization of this phase was

2

considered for diﬀerent Fermi systems ( an analogous state for superconductivity in con-

ventional superconductors in a strong spin - exchange ﬁeld was predicted many years ago

by Sarma [10], in ultracold fermionic atom systems composed of two particle species with

diﬀerent densities and unequal masses [11], in quantum chromodynamics in the context of

color superconductivity [12] ).

We will consider the breached superﬂuidity of cold fermionic atoms in an external mag-

netic ﬁeld under conditions of Feshbach resonance experiments. Usually, these experiments

are initiated by preparing atoms in a mixture of states with diﬀerent spin projections ( for

example, spin - up and spin - down ) with equal populations. We show that the energy

gap parameter of a breached pairing superﬂuidity state in Feshbach resonance experiments

is determined by the magnetic - ﬁeld detuning ∆B from the Feshbach resonance. We show

that a BCS superﬂuid state (SF) exists only for the magnetic - ﬁeld detuning smaller than

one critical, and this critical magnetic - ﬁeld detuning is determined by the equality of the

Zeeman energy splitting for the magnetic - ﬁeld detuning to the energy gap ∆0 of fermionic

atoms without a magnetic ﬁeld. A SF state is lost for ∆B larger than a critical. For ex-

ample, for 6Li atoms this critical magnetic - ﬁeld detuning ∆Bcr is order of 200mG, and

for ∆B > 200mG a SF state is lost. Note that the destroying a superﬂuid state for the

magnetic - ﬁeld detuning ∆B larger than ∆Bcr corresponds to a well - known dichotomy

between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. The strong ﬁeld destroys the superﬂuid

state when the ﬁeld is strong enough to break Cooper pairs, and an external magnetic ﬁeld

provides the pair - breaking mechanism.

We consider an uniform gas of Fermi atoms with two hyperﬁne ( spin - up

and spin

Note that for fermions in an external magnetic ﬁeld for µ

( without a radiofre-

quency driving ) the energy gap parameter of the breached pairing superﬂuidity phase is

determined by ∆Zee = 2µmagB instead δ∆Zee ( Eq.(10b)), and in this case for the conven-

We consider the thermodynamic properties of Fermi atoms with two hyperﬁne states in

In calculations it is convenient to start from the thermodynamic potential Ω, and the con-

densation energy ( the diﬀerence between the thermodynamic potential Ωs in the superﬂuid

state and the value in the normal state Ωn at the same temperature [14]) is given by ( at

only for the magnetic ﬁeld B < Bcr, and this critical magnetic ﬁeld Bcr which destroys the

SF state is determined from the condition that the Zeeman energy splitting ∆(0)

Zee equal to

the energy gap ∆0 without a magnetic ﬁeld. Note that, although, an external magnetic ﬁeld

does not penetrate a bulk conventional superconductor, the strength of the ﬁeld required to

overcome the energy gap, i.e. to destroy superconductivity in conventional superconductors,

is much more than for atomic Fermi gases because the energy gap ∆sup

of the conventional

0

superconductors is much more than ∆0 for atomic Fermi gases , usually, ∆sup

0 /∆0 > 106.

In summary, we show that for fermionic atoms in an external magnetic ﬁeld in Feshbach

resonance experiments there is a breached pairing superﬂuidity for the magnetic - ﬁeld

detuning from the Feshbach resonance larger than one critical. We derived the energy gap

parameter of this phase which is determined by the magnetic - ﬁeld detuning; this unstable

phase exists in the certain range of the Zeeman energy splitting determinable by the energy

gap ∆0. We show that a BCS superﬂuid state exists only for the magnetic - ﬁeld detuning

from the Feshbach resonance smaller than the critical value, and this critical magnetic - ﬁeld

detuning is determined by the equality of the Zeeman energy splitting for the magnetic -

ﬁeld detuning to the energy gap ∆0.

High resolution laser Stark excitation of np (60 < n < 85) Rydberg states of ultra-cold cesium
atoms shows an eﬃcient blockade of the excitation attributed to long-range dipole-dipole interaction.
The dipole blockade eﬀect is observed as a quenching of the Rydberg excitation depending on the
value of the dipole moment induced by the external electric ﬁeld. Eﬀects of eventual ions which
could match the dipole blockade eﬀect are discussed in detail but are ruled out for our experimental
conditions. Analytic and Monte-Carlo simulations of the excitation of an ensemble of interacting
Rydberg atoms agree with the experiments indicates a major role of the nearest neighboring Rydberg
atom.

Long-range dipole-dipole interactions often play an im-
portant role in the properties of an assembly of cold
atoms. One example is the eﬃciency of photoassociation
of cold atoms and the formation of cold molecules [1].
In the case of a Rydberg atomic ensemble, the range of
the dipole-dipole interactions can exceed several microm-
eters, leading to many-body eﬀects [2, 3, 4]. An inter-
esting application of the dipole-dipole interaction is the
dipole blockade (DB) in Rydberg excitation. This eﬀect
oﬀers exciting possibilities for quantum information [5]
with the fascinating possibilities for manipulating quan-
tum bits stored in a single collective excitation in meso-
scopic ensembles, or for realizing scalable quantum logic
gates [6]. The DB process for an ensemble of atoms is
the result of shifting the Rydberg energy from its isolated
atomic value due to the dipole-dipole interaction with the
surrounding atoms. In a large volume, a partial or local
blockade, corresponding to a limitation of the excitation
is expected when the dipole-dipole energy shift exceeds
the resolution of the laser excitation. In a zero electric
ﬁeld, Rydberg atoms present no permanent dipole and
usually no DB is expected. Nevertheless, a van der Waals
blockade, corresponding to a second order dipole-dipole
interaction, has been observed through a limitation of
the excitation of high Rydberg states np (n ∼ 70 − 80)
of rubidium, using a pulsed ampliﬁed single mode laser
[7]. CW excitations have also been performed showing
the suppression of the excitation and aﬀecting the atom
counting statistics [8]. The DB phenomenon itself has
been observed for the ﬁrst time, in the case of cesium
Rydberg atoms, for a so called F¨orster Resonance En-
ergy Transfer (FRET) reaction, np+ np −→ ns+ (n+ 1)s
[9]. The FRET conﬁguration has several advantages: the
dipole-dipole interaction can be tuned on and oﬀ by the
Stark eﬀect, the dipole-dipole interaction having its max-

Its main drawback
imum eﬀect at the resonant ﬁeld.
comes from the fact that the resonance exists only for
n ≤ 41 in the cesium case, which limited the observed
DB to an eﬃciency of ∼ 30%.

In this letter, we report the experimental evidence for a
DB with an eﬃciency larger than 60 %. In order to obtain
higher couplings than the van der Waals or F¨orster ones,
we apply an electric ﬁeld to create a signiﬁcant dipole
moment. Indeed, the Stark Rydberg state, np, presents
an electric dipole moment mostly due to their mixing
with the (n − 1)d state.
It is however experimentally
challenging to observe the dipole blockade eﬀect without
any ambiguity. Ions could for instance lead to a similar
eﬀect as the DB one as shown by Fig 1 [discussed latter].
The letter is presented as following. First we discuss the
role of ions and the importance of removing almost all
ions in the experiment. We then report the DB results
which are ﬁnally compared to an analytical model.

In every Rydberg DB experiment the role of ions needs
to be studied carefully because the presence of a single
ion creates a spurious electric ﬁeld of 1.5 mV/cm at a
distance of 100 µm.

Their role is often underestimated and can lead to a
blockade similar to the Van der Waals blockade eﬀect
[8, 10]. Due to the quadratic variation of the Rydberg
np energy level as a function of the external electric ﬁeld,
the Stark eﬀect created by ions is enhanced compared to
the zero ﬁeld conﬁguration. In the F¨orster conﬁguration,
due to the low n value, it was clearly seen [9] that the
presence of some ions did not aﬀect the observed limita-
tion of the excitation. However, for higher n value, the
presence of a single ion during the excitation could easily,
even for a moderate external electric ﬁeld, shifts the Ry-
dberg energy level by few MHz, which is on the order of
the laser resolution. In other words, the appearance of a
single ion can stop the excitation. To investigate in more
detail how strong the eﬀect of ions is, two kinds of numer-
ical simulations have been performed. The result of the
ﬁrst model (see Fig.1 (a)), based on single atoms reduced
density matrix evolution in the presence of the nearest

neighbors dipole-dipole interaction (detailed hereafter),
illustrates the role of a single ion present at the begin-
ning of the excitation towards the 70p state. Such ion
would aﬀect drastically the results because it has almost
the same eﬀect as the dipole-dipole interaction without
any ion present. However, in our experiment the ions do
not appear at the beginning of the excitation, but only
when Rydberg atoms are present. Indeed, we have ex-
perimentally studied the temporal evolution of the num-
ber of ions and found a constant rate of ionization and
a linear dependence on the number of Rydberg atoms.
The origins of the ions are mainly thermal blackbody ra-
diation and collisional processes between Rydberg atoms
and surrounding hot 6s or cold 6p, 7s atoms (Gallagher et
al., in preparation). Rydberg atom-Rydberg atom colli-
sions, such as Penning ionization occurring from the pair
dynamics under the inﬂuence of the attractive long-range
forces [11, 12], occur only after one microsecond. We have
then derived a second model taking into account a con-
stant ionization rate of the Rydberg atoms. The result of
the second model, based on a kinetic Monte Carlo simula-
tion, illustrates (see Fig.1 (b)) the role of such a Rydberg
ionization, but here with a rate 20 times larger than the
experimental one, if present during the excitation. This
would also aﬀect drastically the results because few ions
have almost the same eﬀect than the dipole-dipole in-
teraction when no ions are present. The kinetic Monte-
Carlo algorithm has been choosen because it gives the ex-
act correct time evolution of rate equations system [13].
Here the rate equations describe the (2-level) atoms ex-
citation, the sum of all possibles two-body dipole-dipole
interactions and the external and ionic electric ﬁelds ef-
fects. In conclusion, the main result of these two types
of simulations is that ions can lift any Rydberg density
eﬀect such as the DB one.

Therefore, the number of ions has to be minimized ex-
perimentally, for instance by avoiding the excitation of
too many Rydberg atoms. The details of the experi-
mental setup have been described in reference [9]. The
Rydberg atoms are excited from a cloud of 5×107 ce-
sium atoms (characteristic radius ∼ 300 µm, peak density
1.2 × 1011 cm−3) produced in a standard vapor-loaded
magneto-optical trap (MOT). The ﬁrst step of the ex-
citation, 6s, F = 4 → 6p3/2, F = 5, is provided either
by the trapping lasers (wavelength: λ1 = 852 nm) or
by an independent laser. The density of excited, 6p3/2,
atoms can be modiﬁed by switching oﬀ the repumping
lasers before the excitation sequence. The second step,
6p3/2, F = 5 → 7s, F = 4, is provided by an infrared
diode laser in an extended cavity device from TOPTICA
(wavelength: λ2 = 1.47 µm, bandwidth: 100 kHz). The
experimental average intensity is ∼ 3 mW/cm2 twice
the saturation one. The last step of the excitation,
7s, F = 4 → np1/2,3/2 (with n = 25 − 140), is pro-
vided by a Titanium:Sapphire laser (Ti:Sa), wavelength
λ3=770 − 800 nm, bandwidth: 1 MHz. The Ti:Sa laser

is switched on with a ﬁxed optical frequency during a
time, τ = 0.3 µs, by means of an acousto-optic modula-
tor. Due to the short 7s lifetime and the short excitation
time the spectral resolution of the excitation ∆L is only
on the order of 5 MHz (when no Ti:Sa optical satura-
tion is present). The Rydberg atoms are selectively ﬁeld
ionized by applying, at a chosen time (between 0 and
1 µs) after the end of the Ti:Sa laser pulse, a high ﬁeld
pulse with a rise time of 700 ns. We use a time of ﬂight
technique and a Micro Channel Plate (MCP) detector to
know the total number of detected ions at the MCP. From
the ∼ 30% quantum detection eﬃciency of the MCP we
estimate the number of Rydberg atoms present in the
experimental area. The plot density is n = N/(2πσ2)3/2.
The beams of the infrared diode laser and Ti:Sa laser
are focused into the atomic cloud with a (1/e2) radius
ω = 70 − 125 µm. The repetition rate of the experiment
is 80 Hz. The Ti:Sa laser polarization is linear and par-
allel to the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld, leading
to the excitation of the magnetic sublevel, np1/2 or np3/2
|m| = 1/2. For clarity we will present here only results
obtained with np3/2 atoms, but similar results have been
obtained when using the np1/2 state [14].

tion of the level, 75p3/2, for diﬀerent values of the static
electric ﬁeld, F , indicating the limitation of the excita-
tion induced by the electric ﬁeld. Fig.2 (b) displays two
spectra of the resonance line for the excitation of the
level, 70p3/2, at zero ﬁeld and at F = 0.25 V/cm. A
clear eﬀect appears at the center of the resonance line

set, log scale).

this point, it is very important to know if this reduction
of the excitation can be attributed to DB or due to ion
blockade. In the present experiment, for evacuating the
role of any ions, we have performed the experiment with
conditions where the observed number of ions is on aver-
age well below unity as shown in inset of Fig. 2 (b). This
absence of ions is conﬁrmed by the fact that the appear-
ance of ions would be correlated with the Rydberg signal.
Indeed, in the simulation, but not in the experiment, we
observe a correlation between the ions and the Rydberg
Signal, leading to the limitation or blockade of the exci-
tation when ions appear (see Fig 1, down triangles).

We then attribute the limitation of the excitation to a
DB and not to an ion blockade. We stress here that the
wings of the resonance should (and are) not aﬀected by
the DB because the number of excited Rydberg atoms
is reduced. However, in our experiment an apparent in-
creasing of the linewidth (FWHM) is observed because
the line has no more a Lorentzian shape.

In Fig. 2 (a) we have observed a quite eﬃcient de-
crease of the number of excited atoms with F for n = 75
due to the DB eﬀect coming from the existence of a non
zero permanent dipole, aligned with the static electric

demonstrates the DB eﬀect for the excitation of diﬀer-
ent levels, np3/2, with n equal to 60, 70 and 85. In this
study, the intensity of the Ti:Sa laser is set to be inversely
proportional to the oscillator strength of the transition,
7s → np, meaning a n3 dependence. To compare the
curves obtained for diﬀerent principal quantum numbers
n, it is convenient to introduce the scale parameter θ

trix model. (b) Data for n=60 and n=85 [same symbols as

(dashed line) is obtained without the DB.

We observe a more eﬃcient DB eﬀect for n = 85 than
for n = 60 when compared with the calculated (dashed)
curve without the dipole-dipole interaction.

To model our data, we have developed a model based
on the interaction of each atom i, with its Rydberg neigh-
bors j (more details can be found in [14]).
If atom i
could be excited to the Rydberg state its energy would
be shifted by an amount of

where −→n ij =
R ij /Rij with Rij the interatomic dis-
tance between the Rydberg atoms i and j. Due to the
1 − 3 cos2 ψ variation of the Wij , where ψ is the angle be-
tween the internuclear axis and the dipoles (i.e. the ex-
ternal ﬁeld), the angular averaging of Wij is zero. There-
fore, we need to discretized the averaging. We found by
the Monte Carlo simulation that the nearest neighbor
interaction dominates. We then model the dipole-dipole
interaction using only the nearest neighbor atom j and
neglect the mean-ﬁeld interaction. This is the opposite in
the van de Waals interaction where we neglect the nearest
neighbor interaction. Wij is signiﬁcant only when both
atoms are in the Rydberg state. We ﬁnd

which corresponds for the atom i to a shift of the Ryd-
berg level np proportional to the local Rydberg density
nRy(−→ri ). Here ρ is the density matrix for the ensemble of
the atoms, and ρi = T r6=iρ is the reduced density matrix
for the single atom i. For a given atom i, we solve the

the ratio between by the gap between the experimental points
and the straight dashed line of slope 1. In (a) and (b): solid
lines are theoretical calculations taking into account the van
der Waals blockade at zero ﬁeld and the DB in the presence
of the electric ﬁeld F1. In (a), for comparison, we have also
presented the curve with no van der Waals coupling (dotted
curve).

Fig.

3 (a) shows the comparison between the cal-
culated curves and the experimental ones with a good
agreement. All curves in this letter, are calculated us-
ing the exact dipole moments calculated by consider-
ing the ensemble of the levels of the Stark diagram [15].
However, most of the results can be understood using a
simpler two-level approach, valid for small electric ﬁelds
(F ≪ 1/3n5, atomic units), assuming only mixing of the
np state with the (n − 1)d one. In this model the np Ry-
dberg permanent dipole is µ ∼ qea0n2 sin θ and the ex-
citation (dashed) curve of Fig. 3 (b) would have a value
of cos2(θ/2). The DB condition: Wij ∼ µ
< h∆L
can then be simply evaluated. This DB condition gives
a limitation to the excitation corresponding to a density
nRy ∼ h∆L4πǫ0/µ2.

4πǫ0R3

Such a limitation is illustrated by Fig. 4(a), showing the
evolution of the DB versus the Ti:Sa laser intensity in
the case of the 70p3/2 Rydberg level, where the DB con-
dition gives ∼ 850 Rydberg atoms and ﬁts well to the
experiment (σ ∼ 100µm). At the electric ﬁeld F1 = 0.25
V/cm (corresponding to tan2 θ = 1) the appearance of
the DB occurs at intensities higher than 100 W/cm2. The
DB eﬃciency is evaluated by comparison with the zero
ﬁeld case. We observe a power saturation for intensities
larger than 250 W/cm2 explaining why the maximum

4

DB eﬃciency is reached when the intensity is close to
250 W/cm2. For higher intensity an optical broadening
occurs so ∆L increases and the DB eﬃciency decreases.
For the zero ﬁeld case, taking into account the van der
Waals coupling between the atoms modiﬁes the theoreti-
cal curve, giving a better agreement with the experimen-
tal data. The DB eﬃciency, evaluated by comparison
with the zero ﬁeld case, is also presented in Fig.4(b) from
two data sets taken at two diﬀerent 6p (and so two dif-
ferent 7s)-atomic densities. The DB appears not to be
dependent on the 6p, 7s densities but only on the number
of excited Rydberg atoms. This result is intrinsic to the
DB and cannot be due to an ion blockade eﬀect coming
from Rydberg atoms ionization created by collisions with
6p or 7s atoms.

To conclude, we have presented the evidence for an ef-
ﬁcient DB controlled via the Stark eﬀect, of the Rydberg
excitation in a cold cesium atomic sample. The observa-
tion of the DB is challenging because no ions should be
present during the short excitation pulse. An analytical
model based on the preferential role of the nearest neigh-
boring Rydberg atoms, conﬁrmed by M.C. simulations,
has been derived and provides a good account of the data.
This result is really promising for quantum information.
A microwave ﬁeld instead of Stark eﬀect or F¨orster may
be used to produce the dipole moments and to control
the DB [16, 17]. A particularly promising direction of
research is now the observation of the total DB, meaning
the collective excitation of a single atom. Prospect for
quantum gate devices and control of ultra-cold Rydberg
atoms in this quantum regime is still a challenge.

Abstract

Highly accurate nonrelativistic ground-state wave function and energy of the lithium atom is obtained

in the Hylleraas basis set. The leading relativistic corrections, as represented by Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian,

are obtained in fair agreement with the former results. The calculational method is based on the analytical

evaluation of Hylleraas integrals with the help of recursion relations.

INTRODUCTION

Theoretical predictions for the energy levels of light few-electron atoms are much less accurate

than for the hydrogenic systems. It is for two reasons. The nonrelativistic wave function has to in-

clude electron correlations to a high degree of accuracy. This can be achieved by using a Hylleraas

basis set, but it is quite difﬁcult to evaluate integrals with Hylleraas functions for three and more

electrons. The second reason is the difﬁculty in the accurate treatment of relativistic and radiative

corrections. The commonly used Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian for few-electron atoms does not

include relativistic corrections properly as it cannot be derived from quantum electrodynamic the-

ory and its continuous spectrum ranges from

to +

. One of the possible approaches is the

−∞
derivation of an effective Hamiltonian [1] within the so called NRQED theory. Matrix elements of

∞

this Hamiltonian give exact correction to the energy at speciﬁed order in the ﬁne structure constant

α. However, this Hamiltonian becomes quite complicated at higher orders and for example m α6

corrections has been obtained for few low lying states of helium only [2, 3], not for lithium nor

beryllium atoms.

Theoretical predictions for light hydrogen-like atoms are at present limited by uncertainty in

higher-order two-loop electron self-energy corrections [4], which is a few kHz for the 1S state. For

helium-like atoms predictions are approximately 103 times less accurate. Since, the nonrelativistic

wave function was computed very accurately using Hylleraas [5] or exponential basis sets [6],

the uncertainty in its levels comes mainly from the unknown m α7 terms. These corrections are

currently under investigation in the context of helium 23PJ ﬁne splitting. For lithium atoms,

the Hylleraas functions give very accurate nonrelativistic wave function and energies [7], but the

precise calculation of three-electron integrals with Hylleraas functions is very time consuming

[8, 9], and so far no result for m α6 corrections have been obtained. For the beryllium atom

the most accurate results have been obtained with explicitly correlated Gaussian functions [10].

Although it was possible to calculate accurately the leading relativistic and QED corrections [11],

the ﬁnal accuracy is limited by the nonrelativistic energy. Moreover, this basis cannot be used for

higher order corrections since Gaussian wave functions do not fulﬁll the cusp condition.

So far the most accurate results for various states of the lithium atom were obtained by Yan and

Drake in Ref. [7]. Here, we present even more accurate results for the lithium ground state, as a

demonstration of an analytic method to compute the integrals with Hylleraas functions [12]. This

new method is based on recursion relations between integrals with different powers of electron-

2

nucleus and inter-electron distances, which are fast and numerically stable for generating large

basis sets. Our result for the ground state energy

E =

7.478 060 323 904 1(+10

−50) ,

−

(1)

is signiﬁcantly below the previous one, obtained in [7], which is E =

7.478 060 323 650 3(71).

−

As a further application of the analytic approach, we obtain the leading relativistic corrections to

the binding energy by the calculation of the expectation value of Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian in Eq.

(13). For this we used recursion relations for extended Hylleraas integrals with 1/r2

ij and 1/r2
i

terms. They have been derived in [13] and in this work respectively.

In the next Section we construct the nonrelativistic wave function, similarly to Ref. [7] and

obtain the ground state nonrelativistic energy and the wave function. In Sec.

III we compute

the leading relativistic correction as given by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. In Sec. IV we derive

recursion relations for Hylleraas integrals containing 1/r2

i which among others, are necessary
for relativistic matrix elements. In Sec. V we summarize our result and present prospects for

calculation of higher order terms as well as the calculation of Hylleraas integrals for 4 and more

electrons.

II. NONRELATIVISTIC WAVE FUNCTION AND ENERGY

In the construction of the wave function we closely follow the works of Yan and Drake in [7].

The ground state wave function Ψ is expressed as a linear combination of ψ, the antisymmetrized

product of φ and the spin function χ

with all ni nonnegative integers and wi

R+. The matrix element of the Hamiltonian H

In this way the calculation of this matrix elements is brought to Hylleraas integrals, namely the

with nonnegative integers ni. These are performed analytically for n1, n2, n3 = 0, 1 [14] and by

recursion relations for larger ni using formulas derived in [12].

The total wave function is generated from all φ in Eq. (3) with ni satisfying condition

for Ω between 3 and 12. For each Ω we minimize energy with respect to the free parameters wi in

Eq. (3). We noticed that the use of only one set of wi’s does not lead to accurate results, therefore,

following Yan and Drake [7], we divide the whole basis set into 5 sectors, each one with its own

set of wi’s. This division goes as follows [7]

= 0;

sector 1: all n3, n1 = 0, n2 = 0;
sector 2: all n3, n1 = 0, n2 6
sector 3: all n3, n1 6
sector 4: n3 = 0, n1 6
= 0, n1 6
sector 5: n3 6

= 0, n2 = 0;
= 0, n2 6
= 0, n2 6

= 0;

= 0;

To avoid numerical instabilities, within each sector we drop the terms with n4 > n5 (or n4 < n5)

and for n4 = n5 drop terms with n1 > n2 (or n1 < n2). This division allows for a signiﬁcant

improvements of nonrelativistic energies by optimization of all ﬁve sets of wi’s. These nonlinear

parameters are obtained by Newton method of searching zeros using analytic derivatives

In the numerical calculations, we use sextuple precision for recursion relations and quadruple

precision for all other arithmetics to obtain the wave function and the energy up to Ω = 12. The

results obtained for ground state energies are presented in Table I. The penultimate row is a result

of extrapolation to inﬁnite length of the basis set, and the last raw are previous results of Yan and

Drake [7]. The result for the nonrelativistic energy is signiﬁcantly below the previous estimate [7]

and indicates that extrapolation to inﬁnite basis length does not always give the right result. In the

E(4) has already been obtained in works [15, 17]. Calculations of these matrix elements involves

the usual Hylleraas integrals with all ni nonnegative and extended integrals, namely with one pa-

rameter ni equal to

1. The direct numerical method to calculate these integrals was presented

−

in [8, 9]. Here we apply the analytic approach. Recursion relations for the case of n1 or n2 or n3

equal to

1 have been obtained in [13]. Hylleraas integrals involving n4 or n5 or n6 equal to

1
−
can in principle be obtained by the integration of the usual Hylleraas integral with respect to the

−

corresponding parameter wi [13]. However, some recursion relations may become unstable, for

example in the case of n4 =

1 the recursion in n1 is numerically unstable for large w1. To avoid

−

this problem we derive in the next section stable recursion relations for extended Hylleraas inte-

grals with ni =

1 for i = 4, 5, 6. Numerical results for matrix elements of the Breit Hamiltonian

using these recursion relations, has been presented in Table I and II. One observes that the lowest

convergence is for the

p4/8 term, and in spite of the differences for separate matrix elements, the

−

−

total relativistic correction is in good agreement with the former result in [15].

for the linear combination of the G functions. If any of the arguments is equal to 0, then G becomes

a known two-electron Hylleraas type integral. These identities are used to derive various recursion

relations. Here, we derive a set of recursions for the case when n4, n5 or n6 is equal to

1. Let

Instead, we use recursions for f (0, 0, 0, 0, n5, n6) and numerically integrate with respect to w1,

w3 in the denominator which is not very convenient in high precision numerical calculations.

V. SUMMARY

We have demonstrated the advantages of the analytic approach to three-electron Hylleraas inte-

grals by the calculation of nonrelativistic energy of the ground state lithium atom and the leading

relativistic corrections. The achieved accuracy is the best to date and this is mainly due to the

use of much larger basis sets. In fact it is possible to perform calculation with Ω > 12 by using

11

sextuple precision arithmetics. The typical evaluation time in sextuple precision for Ω = 12 is 24

hours on 2.4 GHz Opteron, and most of the time is devoted to LU decomposition.

Having precise wave functions, we have calculated leading relativistic corrections and the re-

sults only partially agree with that of Yan and Drake [15] and of King [17]. We are now in position

to calculate higher order, namely m α6 relativistic and QED corrections, for example to the lithium

ground state hyperﬁne splitting [21]. However, this involves more complicated Hylleraas integrals

containing two factors among 1/r2

i and 1/r2

ij, which have not yet been worked out by the recursion

methods of the authors.

Even more interesting is the possible extension of this analytic method to beryllium and

beryllium-like ions, the 4-electron systems. The use of large Hylleraas basis set will allow for

a high precision calculation of the wave function, energies and transition rates. For example,

knowing the isotope shifts, one can obtain charge radii as for the lithium isotope [22]. General

Hylleraas integrals for 4-electron systems has not yet been worked out [23, 24]. The so called

double linked basis set, the functions with at most two odd powers of rij have been used by B¨usse

et al in [25] to obtain an accurate nonrelativistic energy, but still less accurate than the result of

Komasa in [10]. It has not yet been attempted to calculate relativistic corrections with Hylleraas

functions as they involve even more difﬁcult integrals. We think, the integration by part technique,

should allow for the derivation of compact formulas for all 4-electron Hylleraas integrals.

Our primary motivation for developing Hylleraas basis set is the calculation of higher order

relativistic and QED effects, and to demonstrate that standard techniques used in relativistic quan-

tum chemistry, which are based on the multi-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian are not correct

for principal reasons. This Hamiltonian does not not include properly negative energy states. The

correct treatment has to be based on quantum electrodynamics and several very accurate results

for few electron ions have already been obtained within the so called 1/Z expansion [26, 27, 28].

Nevertheless, there is no yet formalism which allows for systematic inclusion of negative energy

states and QED effects for many electron atoms.

good initial values for xi. For this one constructs a homotopy φk(x, t) such that

φk(x, t) = xk−1 for k = 1, n ,

φk(x, t) = (1

(A12)

−

At t = 0, φ(x, 0) are polynomials in √x, therefore one obtains xi = y2

i where yi are nodes for

Gauss-Legendre quadrature. By slowly changing t from 0 one ﬁnds the solution at t = 1. In

the actual numerical calculations we found that the steps ti = i/100 were sufﬁciently small for

the above iteration to converge. This generalized Gaussian quadrature can also be constructed for

other types of functions including various, even nonintegrable singularities.

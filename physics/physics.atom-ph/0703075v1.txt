The Doppler-free spectroscopy of atomic thallium (203Tl and 205Tl) 6P1/2 → 7S1/2 transitions
have been observed using two counter-propagating laser beams perpendicular to the atomic beam,
and the absolute frequencies of these transitions have been measured to an accuracy of <1 MHz (1
ppb) using optical frequency comb. The hyperﬁne splittings derived from our results were improved
by a factor of 7∼8. The isotope shifts are in agreement with the previous experimental results.

INTRODUCTION

High precision measurement in atomic system shows
very promising in testing new physics beyond the stan-
dard model. The linear stark eﬀect measurement in
atomic thallium sets the current upper limit of electrons
electrical dipole moment (EDM)[1], whose existence im-
plies the CP violation. Meanwhile, atomic thallium also
plays an important role in parity non-conservation (PNC)
experiment. The PNC eﬀect has been observed in atomic
thallium system using 6P1/2 → 6P3/2 transition in 1995
[2, 3]. The optical rotation measurement of thallium
reached 1% of experimental uncertainty. Combining the
theoretical calculation, it leads to the weak charge of thal-
lium nucleus, which can be compared with the predica-
tion of the standard model. However, the dominating un-
certainty is the theoretical calculation, which is as large
as 3%. Such a large uncertainty is due to complicate

PNC experiment with cesium, whose atomic structure
is better understood, an experimental accuracy of 0.5%
has been achieved, and the accuracy of theoretical calcu-
lation is only 1% [4, 5, 6]. This result leads to the most
accurate measurement of the weak charge of the cesium
nucleus.

In atomic thallium, strong correlation between three
valance-electrons can not be treated accurately using
many-body-perturbation theory (MBPT), which is the
only calculation needed to be included in the case of ce-
sium, as pointed out by Kozlov [7] and Dzuba [8]. The
calculation combining MBPT and the conﬁguration in-
teraction (CI) [8] was developed to solve the correlation
problem. To test the accuracy of this theoretical ap-
proach, various observables, such as transition energies,
hyperﬁne splittings, transition amplitudes, and polariz-
abilites, should be calculated and compared with exper-

imental results. Therefore, experimental measurements
with high precision would be important for the improve-
ment of theoretical calculation.

In this paper we report precision measurements of
atomic thallium 6P1/2 → 7s1/2 transition frequency and
isotope shifts using optical frequency comb(OFC), which
is a versatile optical frequency measuring tool [9]. The
absolute frequencies in the region between 500-1000 nm
can be measured to high accuracies with OFC. A self-
referenced Ti:Sapphire frequency comb linked to a mas-
ter atomic clock can reach to an accuracy of kHz, or
better. Such a high precision experiment was possible
only using a complicate frequency chain. Now, in most
of cases with a compact OFC system, the accuracy of op-
tical transition frequency measurement is only limited by
the linewidth of the observed atomic or molecular tran-
sitions and signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, rather
than the frequency measuring tool itself.

In atomic thallium, the ground state 378 nm reso-
nance transition has been studied in details using both
gas cell [10] [11] and atomic beam [12]. However, the
large linewidthes, due to laser or the Doppler broadened
features,
limited the accuracy of measurements. The
Doppler-broadened spectrum of this transition has been
performed in both of direct absorption [10] and ﬂuores-
cence [11] experiments with a gas cell. However, to our
knowledge, no Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy has
been observed yet. Hence, the large Doppler linewidth
(600 MHz) limits the accuracy of isotope shift and hy-
perﬁne splitting measurement in 7S1/2.

The major diﬃculty of the cell experiment to acquire
Doppler-free spectrum is due to the large branch ra-
tio of 7S1/2 → 6P3/2 decay route (in comparison with
7S1/2 → 6P1/2, see Fig. 1), and the long lifetime of 6P3/2
metastable state. The exciting 378 nm laser causes an
optical pumping eﬀect to trap population in the 6P3/2
metastable state, then a long recovering time of the
6P1/2 ground state population. This implies a low ef-
fective saturation intensity of 6P1/2 → 7S1/2 transition,
therefore a strong power broadening eﬀect. To perform

the Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy with gas cell,
even the minimum required power for reasonable signal
strength could induce a large power-broadened linewidth
close to Doppler width. Lowering laser intensity will
not reduce power broadening only, but also the signal
strength. A detailed study of such optical pumping ef-
fect in atomic thallium can be found in [11].

In the atomic beam experiment, the ﬁnite laser-atom
interaction time (transit time) becomes an eﬀective
shorter recover time of ground state population [13], and
then reduces power broadening. Although, there is a
trade-oﬀ of transit time broadening. In the interaction re-
gion of 1 mm, the transit time broadening of atom with a
velocity of 300 m/s, is <1 MHz. Using atomic beam spec-
troscopy with only one single laser beam, the Doppler
shift becomes a serious systematic error, because of the
imperfect perpendicular between laser and atomic beam.
In our experiment, we employed two counter propagating
laser beams and observed the Lamb dip to eliminate such
a problem. The observed linewdith of Doppler-free spec-
trum is only ∼ 20 MHz without the ﬁrst order Doppler
shift .

II. EXPERIMENT

The experimental setup is illustrated as Fig. 2. A col-
limated atomic beam was irradiated perpendicularly by
the frequency-doubled 755 nm Ti:sapphire. The atomic
beam source was an eﬀusion oven containing thallium.
The transition was detected by measuring 535 nm ﬂu-
orescence. A small portion of 755 nm laser beam was
picked up using a blank glass plate, and sent to optical
frequency comb through a single mode optical ﬁber. A
reference cavity with a FSR=300 MHz was used to moni-
tor the laser mode while laser was scanning. The absolute
frequency of laser was also measured using a home-made
wavemeter with GHz accuracy.

FIG. 2: The experimental setup of absolute frequency mea-
surement of thallium 6P1/2 → 7S1/2 transition

A. 378 nm Laser System

The 378 nm UV light was generated using a LBO crys-
tal (Breswter’s angle cut, 3 × 3 × 10mm3) in a enhance
cavity pumped by a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent MBR-
110) of 755 nm. The enhance cavity was a ring conﬁgura-
tion with astigmatism compensation. Cavity resonance
was locked on the fundamental laser frequency using the
technique of polarization rotation [14]. The typical con-
version eﬃciency was 15%/W with an input coupler of
T=3%. 500µW was used in our experiment. The inten-
sity noise was <5% due to the acoustic vibration in the
frequency of ∼ kHz. It was collimated to a beam size of
3 mm× 10 mm using an AR coated lens. The longer side
of the elliptical beam shape was parallel to the atomic
beam.

B. Atomic Beam and Signal Detection

The collimated atomic beam with reduced transverse
velocity component was used to reduce the Doppler
broadening eﬀect and to increase the spectral resolution.
The thermal atomic beam, as in Fig. 3, was generated
from thallium bulk, which was heated to 450◦C. The
temperature near the front exit hole was kept 50◦ higher
than the rest part of oven to prevent condensation us-
ing another heater. The most probable velocity of thal-
lium atom was ∼ 300 m/s. The atomic thallium beam
was collimated using two 2 mm apertures separated by
5 mm. The residual Doppler width, due to the beam
divergence, was estimated to be 30 MHz in our system.
These apertures, between oven and experimental cham-
bers, were also for diﬀerential pumping. The experimen-
tal chamber was pumped using a small turbo pump (50
l/s) to maintain a pressure < 10−5 torr. The oven cham-

We calibrated this frequency comb system by measur-
ing the well-known a10 hyperﬁne component of molecular
iodine R(56)32-0 transition at 532 nm. The result is in
good agreement with the established international stan-
dard.

D. Frequency measurement

The 755 nm laser and frequency comb laser were com-
bined using a polarization beam splitter (PBS), and pro-
jected to 45◦ polarization using a polarizer. The beat
frequency, which was detected using an avalanche photo-
diode (APD), and the ﬂuorescence signal were simulta-
neously recorded by a computer. We performed a very
slow scan, which is 100 MHz/min, to minimize the lag
between the frequency reading and ﬂuorescence signal
output. Although such a lag eﬀect was cancelled out by
backward scanning. A single scan consists of 1000–2000
data points within the frequency range of 100–200 MHz
in terms of laser frequency.

ber was pumped using a larger turbo (170 l/s) to reach
a pressure ∼ 10−5 torr. The higher pressure of this was
caused by the high temperature of oven. The ﬂange join-
ing these two chambers was water-cooled to prevent heat-
transferring from oven to experimental chamber.

Two counter-propagating laser beams were used to
eliminate the linear Doppler shift, since the resulted
shifts of counter-propagating directions are opposite and
the Lamb dip can be observed. Two view ports for laser
injection are AR coated UV fused silica. Laser induced
ﬂuorescence (LIF) was collected using a 1 inch f=30mm
lens, passed through a dielectric 535 nm ﬁlter, and de-
tected using a photomultiplier. The laser intensity was
modulated using an optical chopper with a frequency of
2 kHz to reduce noise.

C. Optical Frequency Comb

The optical frequency comb system was based on a
mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (Giga Jet 20) with 1 GHz
repetition rate, and pumped by 5W 532 nm DPSS Laser
(Millennia V). It was a self-reference conﬁguration linked
to a rubidium clock (SRS PRS10) using the technique of
optical frequency synthesizer [9], as shown in Fig. 4. All
of the electronic universal counters and the frequency
synthesizer were externally referenced to the same rubid-
ium frequency standard. A 760 nm bandpass ﬁlter was
used to ﬁlter out the unnecessary frequency comb lines
and to avoid optical damage of the photodiode (Fig. 2).
The frequency ﬂuctuation of the stabilized repetition fre-
quency and oﬀset frequency were 4 mHz, and 11 mHz,
respectively. The total frequency ﬂuctuation is few kHz
in optical frequency (N = 4 × 105), and the accuracy
, which was limited by the rubidium master clock and
phase noise from frequency synthesizer, was 10−11 [15].
The Allen deviation of stabilized repetition rate is shown
in Fig. 5. It could be improved by linking the master
clock to 1pps signal from GPS receiver. However, This
is not necessary in our experiment, since the required
accuracy is few tens kHz.

The laser frequency can be calculated with a simple

equation :

 (cid:13)

funknown = N × fr ± fo ± fb ,

where the repetition rate of comb laser fr is ∼1 GHz. N
was a large integer, ∼ 4 × 105. The oﬀset frequency of
comb laser fo and the measured beat frequency fb were
typically several hundreds MHz. Firstly, N was roughly
determined by the home-made wavemeter with an accu-
racy of GHz. Then, comparing several scans of the same
transition with various fo, a series of corresponding mea-
surements of fb was obtained. Since each set of fo, fb,
and N should result in the same frequency, the signs
of fo and fb, and N can be accurately determined. To
improve the statistic accuracy, the ﬁnal spectrum was a
histogram combining several diﬀerent scans. The error-
bar of the histogram was given by the standard deviation
of signal strength of the same laser frequency bin. Figure
6 shows the histogram of all (20) measurements of 203Tl:
6P1/2(F = 0) → 7S1/2(F = 1) transition. The binning of
frequency is 0.5 MHz. Using 0.1 MHz binning, there was
no improvement or degradation of the resulted transition
frequency.

The spectrum was ﬁtted to a combination of two Viogt

and a Lorentzian functions:

S = A1 × Voigt(ω0 − ωshift, wL, wG1)
+ A2 × Voigt(ω0 + ωshift, wL, wG2)
− A3 × Lorentzian(ω0, wL)
+ C

(1)

The negative sign of A3 represents the central dip of the
spectrum. wG1 and wG2 are the Gaussian widths of two
Voigt functions. wL is the homogenous broadening, in-
cluding laser linewidth, transit time broadening, power
broadening, natural linewidth, and so forth. Two Viogt
functions refer to two ﬂuorescence signals excited from
two counter-propagating light. The splitting of these two
proﬁles (ωshift) is due to that the laser beam is not ex-
actly perpendicular to the atomic beam (∆φ).
In our
experiment, ωshift ∼ 15 MHz and ∆φ ∼ 38 mrd, which is
consistent with our experimental setup. We scanned ∆φ
from +40 mrd to -40 mrd to conﬁrm that the central
dip was a Doppler-free saturation dip, rather than just
a signal decreasing in a proﬁle combining two separated
Doppler broadened spectrum due to forward and back-
ward laser beams. The center of the Doppler-free dip
(Lorentzian, from atoms with v = 0), ω0, was indepen-
dent on ωshift, and a sensitive marker for the exact center
of the atomic transition. The ﬁtting program is writ-
ten on ROOT platform (CERN) using the built-in Voigt
function.

The frequency uncertainty is estimated by:

(∆funknown)2 = (N × ∆fr)2 + (∆fo)2 + (∆fb)2 .

quency was 4 mHz, so the uncertainty of the absolute

frequency measurement contributed by the ﬁrst term
(N × ∆fr) is 2 kHz. The stabilized oﬀset frequency ﬂuc-
tuation ∆fo is only 11 mHz. Therefore, the predomi-
nant uncertainty of the absolute frequency measurement
in this work is due to the uncertainty of beat frequency,
∆fb, which is the statistic uncertainty from the ﬁtting to
histogram data.

III. RESULTS

A. The absolute transition frequency

Figure 6 shows one of transitions with ﬁtting curve,
the laser frequency we measured is infrared, rather than
atomic transition frequency—UV light. This histogram
with 500 kHz binning combined 5 forward-backward
scans at diﬀerent time. The accuracy of measured ab-
solute frequency is sub-MHz, as the signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) is ∼ 50, and the FHWM of Lamb dip is <30 MHz.
The ﬁnal absolute frequency measurements of all six com-
ponents of thallium 6P1/2 − 7S1/2 transitions, including
three hyperﬁne transitions and two isotopes, are listed
in Table. I. They are labeled as A − F for identiﬁca-
tion, and in comparison with the previous experimental
measurement and the theoretical calculation.

B. HFS, IS and the Mean Square Isotopic Change
λc,m

Our hyperﬁne splitting and isotope shift measurements
are in good agreement with the previous experimental re-
sults as shown in Table II. Our measurement of 6P1/2 hy-
perﬁne splitting, using purely optical method, is consis-
tent with the magnetic resonance experiment in 1956 [19],

however our result is less accurate. For the 7S1/2 hyper-
ﬁne splitting, our measurement improved the accuracy
by a factor of 7∼8, in comparison with the most recent
measurements using gas cell [10] and single laser atomic
beam [12]. The 6P1/2 → 7S1/2 transition isotope shift
between 205Tl and 203Tl (δν205−203 = 1659.0(6) MHz)
was also measured . This result is in very agreement
with [10].

The hyperﬁne anomaly, ∆ = [(A205/A203)(g203/g205)−
1], can be deduced from our measured hyperﬁne con-
stants A205 and A203. Using the most precise magnetic
moments measured in [22], ∆ = −3.34(23) × 10−4 was
deduced. The hyperﬁne anomaly can be used to infer a
parameter for the mean square isotopic change λc,m [20],
which is related to the magnetic moments and charge
distributions in the isotopes. We infer

λc,m = 0.44(3) fm2

using our experimental results. This parameter inferred
from the results of the 7S1/2 state HFS reported in [10]
is given as λc,m = 0.61(20) fm2 and λc,m = 0.45(24) fm2
in [12]. λc,m = 0.42 fm2 can also be given based on much
more precise ground state 6P1/2 HFS measured by [20]
and [19]. All of theses measurements are summarized in
Fig. 7. Our result is the most precise value based on
7S1/2 HFS.

ﬁrst time, the absolute transition frequencies of six com-
ponents of 203Tl and 205Tl were measured to sub-MHz
accuracy. These results improve the measurement of hy-
perﬁne splittings of 7S1/2 state. The mean square iso-
topic change λc,m deduced from the hyperﬁne anomaly
of 7S1/2 state have also been improved. Our result is in
very good agreement with the most precise value from
the hyperﬁne anomaly of 6P1/2.

The optical pumping eﬀect tapping the population on
6P3/2 state can be used for the future laser cooling of

Abstract

Ab initio theoretical calculations are reported for the electric (E1) dipole allowed and inter-

combination ﬁne structure transitions in Fe V using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) method.
We obtain 3865 bound ﬁne structure levels of Fe V and 1.46 × 106 oscillator strengths, Ein-
stein A-coeﬃcients and line strengths. In addition to the relativistic eﬀects, the intermediate

coupling calculations include extensive electron correlation eﬀects that represent the complex con-

ﬁguration interaction (CI). For bound-bound transitions the BPRM method, based on atomic

collision theory, entails the computation of the CI wavefunctions of the atomic system as an

(electron + target ion) complex. The target ion Fe VI is represented by an eigenfunction expan-

sion of 19 ﬁne structure levels dominated by the spectroscopic conﬁguration 3d3, and a number

of correlation conﬁgurations. Fe V bound levels are obtained with angular and spin symmetries
SLπ and Jπ of the (e + Fe VI) system such that 2S +1 = 5,3,1, L ≤ 10, J ≤ 8. The bound levels
are obtained as solutions of the Breit-Pauli (e + ion) Hamiltonian for each Jπ, and are designated

according to the ‘collision’ channel quantum numbers. A major task has been the identiﬁcation

of these large number of bound ﬁne structure levels in terms of standard spectroscopic desig-

nations. A new scheme, based on the analysis of quantum defects and channel wavefunctions,

has been developed. The identiﬁcation scheme aims particularly to determine the completeness

1

of the results in terms of all possible bound levels with n ≤ 10, l ≤ n − 1, for applications to
analysis of experimental measurements and plasma modeling. Sample results are presented and

the accuracy of the results is discussed. A comparison of the dipole length and velocity oscillator

strengths is presented, indicating an uncertainty of 10-20% for most transitions.

Introduction

Transition probabilities of heavy elements, particularly the iron group, are of great importance

in astrophysical and laboratory sources. Fuhr et al.

[1] have compiled data from a number of

available sources. However, the accuracy and the extent of these data is largely inadequate for

many general applications such as the calculation of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)

stellar opacities [2,3], and radiative levitation and accelerations of heavy elements [4]. Among

the particular applications including Fe V as a prominent spectral constituent are the the non-

LTE models of Fe V spectra in hot stars [5], and the observed extreme ultraviolet Fe V emission

from young white dwarfs [6]. For example, currently available data for Fe V fails to account

for the observed opacity of iron in the XUV region where observations of newly formed hot and

young white dwarfs clearly show Fe V lines [6]. In all of these applications it is highly desirable

to have as complete a dataset of radiative transition probabilities as possible. While the twin

problems of completeness and accuracy pose a challenge to the theoretical methods, they are of

interest not only in various applications but may also be of use in the analysis of experimental

measurements of observed energy levels of complex atomic systems from the iron group.

The Opacity Project (OP) [7,2] and the Iron Project (IP) [8] laid the foundation for large-

scale theoretical calculations using ab intio methods. The R-matrix method [9], based on atomic

collision theory techniques and adapted for the OP [10] and the IP [8], has proven to be very

eﬃcient for these calculations. Whereas the OP calculations were all in the LS coupling approx-

imation, with no relativistic eﬀects included, the subsequent IP work is in intermediate coupling

using the Breit-Pauli extension of the R-matrix method [8]. While most the IP work has con-

centrated on collisional calculations, recent works have extended the BPRM method to radiative

bound-bound and bound-free calculations for transition probabilities [11], photoionization [12],

and (electro-ion) recombination [13]. The ﬁrst comprehensive BPRM calculation of ﬁne structure

2

transition probabilities was carried out for the highly charged ions Fe XXIV and Fe XXV [11]

that are of special interest in X-ray astronomy. Very good agreement was found with existing

results available for a limited number of transitions but using very accurate theoretical methods

including relativistic and QED eﬀects [14,15], thus establishing the achievable accuracy for the

BPRM calculations. However those He-like and Li-like atomic systems are relatively simple, and

the electron correlation eﬀects relatively weak, compared to the low ionization stages of iron

group elements. The present work attempts to enlarge the scope of the possible BPRM calcula-

tions to include the iron group elements, as well as to solve some outstanding problems related

to level identiﬁcations in ab initio theoretical calculations using collision theory methods.

Unlike atomic structure calculations, where the electronic conﬁgurations are pre-speciﬁed

and the levels identiﬁed, the bound levels calculated by collision theory methods adopted in the

OP and the IP need to be identiﬁed since only the channel quantum numbers are known for

the bound states corresponding to the (e + ion) Hamiltonian of a given total angular and spin

symmetry SLπ or Jπ. The precise correspondence between the channels of the collision complex,

and the bound levels, must therefore be determined. The problem is non-trivial for complex

atoms and ions with many highly mixed levels due to conﬁguration interaction. In the OP work,

carried out in LS coupling, this problem was solved by an analysis based on quantum defects and

the numerical components of wavefunctions in the region outside the R-matrix boundary (that

envelops the target ion orbitals). The present work extends that treatment to the analysis of ﬁne

structure levels computed in intermediate coupling. In addition, considerable eﬀort is devoted

to the determination of the completeness of the set of computed bound levels; comparison with

the expected levels derived from all possible combination of angular and spin quantum numbers

reveals the missing levels. The general procedure could be applied to spectroscopic measurements

and the analysis of observed levels of a given atomic system by comparison with the theoretical

predictions.

2. Theory

The general theory for the calculation of bound states in the close coupling (CC) approximation

of atomic collision theory, using the R-matrix method, is described by Burke and Seaton [16] and

3

Seaton [17]. The application to the Opacity Project work is described by Seaton [7], Berrington

et al. [10], and Seaton et al. [2]. The relativistic extensions of the R-matrix method in the Breit-

Pauli approximation are discussed by Scott and Taylor [18], and the computational details by

Berrington, Eissner, and Norrington [19]. The application to the Iron Project work is outlined

in Hummer et al. [8].

In the present work we describe the salient features of the theory and computations as they

pertain to large-scale BPRM calculations for complex atomic systems.

Identiﬁcation of ﬁne

structure energy levels is discussed in detail.

Following standard collision theory nomenclature, we refer to the (e + ion) complex in terms

of the ’target’ ion, with N bound electrons, and a ’free’ electron that may be either bound or

continuum. The total energy of the system is either negative or positive; negative eigenvalues of

the (N + 1)-electron Hamiltonian correspond to bound states of the (e + ion) system. In the

coupled channel or close coupling (CC) approximation the wavefunction expansion, Ψ(E), for

a total spin and angular symmetry SLπ or Jπ, of the (N+1) electron system is represented in

terms of the target ion states as:

where χi is the target ion wave function in a speciﬁc state SiLiπi or level Jiπi, and θi is the wave

ΨE(e + ion) = AXi

χi(ion)θi +Xj

cjΦj,

(1)

function for the (N+1)th electron in a channel labeled as SiLi(Ji)πi k2

i ℓi(SLπ) [Jπ]; k2

i (= ǫi) is

the incident kinetic energy. In the second sum the Φj’s are correlation wavefunctions of the (N+1)

electron system that (a) compensate for the orthogonality conditions between the continuum and

the bound orbitals, and (b) represent additional short-range correlation that is often of crucial

importance in scattering and radiative CC calculations for each SLπ.

The functions Ψ(E) are given by the R-matrix method in an inner region r ≤ a. These are
bounded at the origin and contain radial functions that satisfy a logarithmic boundary condition

at r = a [20]. In the outer region r > a the inner region functions are matched to a set of linearly

independent functions that correspond to all possible (e + ion) channels of a given symmetry

SLπ or Jπ. The outer region wavefunctions are computed for all channels, (CtStLtπt)ǫl, where

Ct is the target conﬁguration, and used to determine the individual channel contributions (called

“channel weights”).

In the relativistic BPRM calculations the set of SLπ are recoupled to obtain (e + ion) levels

with total Jπ, followed by diagonalisation of the (N+1)-electron Hamiltonian,

and the additional terms are the one-body terms, the mass correction term, the Darwin term

and the spin-orbit term respectively. Spin-orbit interaction, H so

structure levels labeled by Jπ, where J is the total angular momentum. Other terms of the

where ν is the eﬀective quantum number relative to the core level. If E < 0 then all continuum

channels are ‘closed’ and the solutions represent bound states. Determination of the quantum
defect (µ(ℓ)), deﬁned as νi = n − µ(ℓ) where νi is relative to the core level SiLiπi, is helpful in
establishing the ℓ-value associated with a given channel (level).

At E < 0 a scattering channel may represent a bound state at the proper eigenvalue of the

Hamiltonian (Eq. 2). A large number of channels are considered for the radiative processes of

Fe V. Each SLπ or Jπ symmetry is treated independently and corresponds to a large number

of channels. Therefore, the overall conﬁguration interaction included in the total (e + ion)

wavefunction expansion is quite extensive. This is the main advantage of the CC method in

representing electron correlation accurately.

a) Level identiﬁcation and coupling schemes

The BPRM calculations in intermediate coupling employ the pair-coupling representation

Si + Li −→ Ji
Ji + ℓ −→ K
K + s −→ J

,

(7)

where the ‘i’ refers to the target ion level and ℓ, s are the orbital angular momemtum (partial

wave) and spin of the additional electron. According to designations of a collision complex, a

channel is fully speciﬁed by the quantum numbers

(SiLi Ji)πi ǫi ℓi K s [Jπ]

(8)

The main problem in identiﬁcation of the ﬁne structure levels stems from the fact that the

bound levels are initially given only as eigenvalues of the (e + ion) Hamiltonian of a given sym-

metry Jπ. Each level therefore needs to be associated with the quantum numbers characterizing

a given collision channel. Subsequently, three main parameters are to be determined: (i) the

parent or the target ion level, (ii) the orbital, eﬀective and principal quantum numbers (l, ν, n)

of the (N+1)th electron, and (iii) the symmetry, SLπ. The task is relatively straightforward for

simple few-electron atomic systems. For example, in a recent work Nahar and Pradhan [11] have

calculated a large number of transition probabilities for Li-like Fe XXIV and He-like Fe XXV,

where the problem of level identiﬁcation is trivial, compared to the present work, since the bound

levels are well separated in energy and in ν. However when a number of mixed bound levels fall

within a given interval (ν, ν + 1), for the same Jπ, the quantum numbers and the magnitude

of the components in all associated channels must be analysed. A scheme for identiﬁcation of

levels is developed (discussed later) that rests mainly on an analysis of quantum defects of the

bound levels and their orbital angular momenta, and the percentage of the total wavefunction

in all channels of a given Jπ.

Following level identiﬁcation, further work is needed to enable a direct correspondence with

standard spectroscopic designations that follow diﬀerent coupling schemes, such as between LS

and JJ, appropriate for atomic structure calculations as, for example, in the NIST tables of

observed energy levels [1]. The correspondence provides the check for completeness of calculated

set of levels or the levels missing. The level identiﬁcation procedure involves considerable ma-

6

nipulation of the bound level data and, although it has been encoded for general applications,

still requires analysis and interpretation of problem cases of highly mixed levels that are diﬃcult

to identify.

b) Oscillator strengths and transition probabilities

The oscillator strength (or photoionization cross section) is proportional to the generalized line

strength deﬁned, in either length form or velocity form, by the equations

and

In these equations ω is the incident photon energy in Rydberg units, and Ψi and Ψf are the wave

functions representing the initial and ﬁnal states respectively. The boundary conditions satisﬁed

by a bound state with negative energy correspond to exponentially decaying partial waves in all

‘closed’ channels, whilst those satisﬁed by a free or continuum state correspond to a plane wave
in the direction of the ejected electron momentum ˆk and ingoing waves in all open channels.

Using the energy diﬀerence, Eji, between the initial and ﬁnal states, the oscillator strength,

3. Computations

The target wavefunctions of Fe VI were obtained by Chen and Pradhan [21] from an atomic

structure calculation using the Breit-Pauli version of the SUPERSTRUCTURE program [22],

intended for electron collision calculations with Fe VI using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix method.

Present work employs their optimized target of 19 ﬁne structure levels [21] corresponding to

the 8-term LS basis set of 3d3(4F , 4P , 2G, 2P , 2D2, 2H, 2F , 2D1). The set of correlation

conﬁgurations used were 3s23p63d24s, 3s23p63d24d, 3s3p63d4, 3p63d5, 3s23p43d5, and 3p63d44s.

The values of the scaling parameter in the Thomas-Fermi potential for each orbital of the target

ion are given in Ref. [21]. Table I lists the 19 ﬁne structure energy levels of Fe VI used in the

eigenfunction expansion where the energies are the observed ones. Most bound levels in low

ionization stages correspond to the level of excitation of the parent ion involving the ﬁrst few

excited states. The criterion remains the accuracy of the target represetation that constitute the

core ion states. The (N+1) electron conﬁgurations, Φj, which meet the orthogonality condition

for the CC expansion (the second term of the wavefunction, Eq. (1)) are given below Table I.

The same set of conﬁgurations is used for all the states considered in this work. STG1 of the

BPRM codes computes the one- and two-electron radial integrals using the one-electron target

orbitals generated by SUPERSTRUCTURE. The number of continuum basis functions is 12.

The present calculations are concerned with all possible bound levels with n ≤ 10, ℓ ≤ n−1.
These correspond to total (e + Fe VI) symmetries (SLπ) with (2S + 1) = 1,3,5 and L = 0 - 10

(even and odd parities). The intermediate coupling calculations are carried out on recoupling

these LS symmetries in a pair-coupling representation, Eq. 6, in stage RECUPD. The computer

memory requirement for this stage is the maximum, since it carries out angular algebra of

dipole matrix elements of a large number of ﬁne structure levels. The (e + Fe VI) Hamiltonian

is diagonalized for each resulting Jπ in STGH. The negative eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian

correspond to the bound levels of Fe V, that are found according to the procedure described

below.

8

a) Calculation of bound levels

The eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian for each Jπ are determined with a numerical search on an

eﬀective quantum number mesh, with an interval ∆ν, using the code STGB. In the relativistic

case, the number of Rydberg series of levels increases considerably from those in LS coupling due

to splitting of the target states into their ﬁne structure components. This results in a large number

of ﬁne structure levels in comparatively narrow energy bands. A mesh with ∆(ν) = 0.01 is usually

adequate to scan for LS term energies; however, it is found to be of insuﬃcient resolution for ﬁne

structure energy levels. The mesh needs to be ﬁner by an order of magnitude, i.e., ∆(ν) = 0.001,

so as not to miss out any signiﬁcant number of bound levels. This considerably increases the

computational requirements for the intermediate coupling calculations of bound levels over the

LS coupling case by orders of magnitude. The calculations take up to several CPU hours per
Jπ in order to determine the corresponding eigenvalues. All bound levels of total J ≤ 8, of both
parities, are considered. However, a further search with an even ﬁner ∆ν reveals that a few levels

are still missing for some Jπ symmetries.

b) Procedure for level identiﬁcation

The energy levels in the BPRM approximation (from STGB) are identiﬁed by Jπ alone. This

is obviously insuﬃcient information to identify all associated quantum numbers of a level from

among a large set levels for each Jπ, typically a few hundred for Fe V. A sample set of energy

levels for J = 2, even parity, obtained from the BPRM calculations is presented in Table II.

The table shows energies and eﬀective quantum number νg, as calculated relative to the ground

level (3d3 4F3/2) of the core ion Fe VI. The complexity of the calculations, and that of level

identiﬁcation, may be gauged from the fact that 30 of these levels have nearly the same νg.

Further, the νg do not in general correspond to the actual eﬀective quantum number of the Fe V

level since it may belong to an excited parent level, and not the ground level, of Fe VI.

A scheme has been developed to identify the levels with complete spectroscopic information

consisting of

and also to designate the levels with a possible SLπ symmetry. The designation of the SLπ,

(Ct St Lt Jt πtℓ [K]s) J π,

(14)

9

from the identiﬁcations denoted above, is generally ambiguous since the collision channels are all

in intermediate coupling. However, in most cases we are able to carry through the identiﬁcation

procedure to the LS term designation. An advantage of identiﬁcation is that it greatly facilitates

the completeness check for all possible LS terms and locate any missing levels. A computer code

PRCBPID has been developed to identify all the quantum numbers relevant to the Jπ and the

LS term assignments. Identiﬁcation is carried out for all the levels belonging to a Jπ symmetry

at a time.

The components of the total wavefunction of a given ﬁne structure energy level span all closed

”collision” channels (CtStLt(Jt)πt)ǫl. Each channel contains the information of the relevant core

and the outer electron angular momentum. The “channel weights”, mentioned earlier, determine

the magnitude of the wavefunction in the outer R-matrix region of each channel evaluated in

STGB. A bound level may be readily assigned to the quantum numbers of a given channel

provided the corresponding channel weight (in percentage terms) dominates the other channels.

The number of channels can be large especially for complex ions. For Fe V, for example, each

level with J > 2 corresponds to several hundred channels. As the ﬁrst step in the level identi-

ﬁcation scheme we isolate the two most dominant channels by comparing all channel percentage

weights. The reason is that the largest channel percentage weight may not uniquely determine

the identiﬁcations since the channel weights are evaluated from the outer region contributions

(r > a); the inner region contributions are unknown. Also, many levels are often heavily mixed

and no assignment for the dominant channel may be made.

The program, PRCBPID, sorts out the duplicate identiﬁcations in all the levels of the Jπ

symmetry. Two levels with the same conﬁguration and set of quantum numbers can actually

be two independent levels due to outer electron spin addition/ subtraction to/from the parent
spin angular momentum, i.e. St ± s = S. The identical pair of levels are tagged with positive
and negative signs indicating higher and lower multiplicity respectively. The lower energies are

normally assigned with the higher spin multiplicity. However, the energies and eﬀective quantum

numbers (ν) of levels of higher and lower spin multiplicity can be very close to each other, in

which case the spin multiplicity assignment may be uncertain.

One important identiﬁcation criterion is the analysis of the quantum defect, µ, or the eﬀective

quantum number, ν, of the outer or the valence electron. The principle quantum number, n,

10

of the outer electron of a level is determined from its ν, and a Rydberg series of levels can be

identiﬁed from the eﬀective quantum number. Hence, in the identiﬁcation procedure, ν of the

lowest member (level with the lowest principal quantum number of the valence electron) of a

Rydberg series is determined from quantum defect analysis of all the computed levels for each

partial wave l. The lowest partial wave has the highest quantum defect. A check is maintained to

diﬀerentiate the quantum defect of a ′s′ electron with that of an equivalent electron state which

has typically a large value in the close coupling calculations. The principle quantum number,

n, of the lowest member of the series is determined from the orbital angular momentum of the
outer electron and the target or core conﬁguration. Once ν and µ = n − ν of the lowest member
are known, the n-values of all levels can be assigned for each paritial wave, l. The relevant

Rydberg series of levels is also identiﬁed from the levels that have the same symmetry, Jπ, core

conﬁguration, Ct St Ltπt and outer electron orbital angular momentum l, but diﬀerent ν that
diﬀers between successive levels by ∼ 1. While the ν(n ℓ) are more accurate for the higher
members of the series, they are more approximate for the lowest ones. The quantum defect of a

given partial wave ℓ also varies slightly with diﬀerent parent core levels and ﬁnal SLJ symmetries.

Of the two most dominant channels the proper one for each bound level is determined based

on several criteria. There are cases when more than two levels are found to have identical

identiﬁcations. These levels are checked individually for proper identiﬁcation. Often a swap of

identiﬁcations is needed between the two sets of dominant channels since the second dominating

channel is more likely to be associated with the given level, consistent with all other criteria.

In some cases the most dominant channel (largest percentage weight in the outer region) may

correspond to comparatively larger ν for the partial wave ℓ, than to a reasonable ν for the second

channel, indicating that the identiﬁcation should correspond to the second channel.

In a few cases a level is found not to correspond to any of the two dominant channels,

predetermined from the channel weights. At the same time often a level is found to be missing in

the same energy range. In such case the level is assigned to a channel of lower percentage weight

that has a reasonable core conﬁguration and term, nl quantum numbers for the outer electron

and eﬀective quantum number that match the missing level.

There are a number of levels belonging to equivalent-electron conﬁgurations and require

diﬀerent identiﬁcation criteria from those of the Rydberg states. These levels usually have: (i) a

11

number of approximately equal channel weights, and (ii) quantum defects that are larger than

that of the lowest partial wave, or an inconsistent ν that does not match with any reasonable

n. Once these levels are singled out, they are identiﬁed with the possible conﬁgurations of the

core level, augmented by one electron in the existing orbital sub-shell. These low-lying levels are

often assigned to those identiﬁed from the small experimentally available set of observed levels.

The levels that can not be identiﬁed in the above procedure, such as by swapping of channels,

or maching to a missing level, are assumed to belong to mixed states. These are not analysed

futher by quantum defects.

Two additional (and related) problems, as mentioned above, are addressed in the identiﬁca-

tion work: (A) standard LS coupling designation, SLπ, and (B) the completeness check for the

set of all ﬁne structure components within an LS multiplet. Identiﬁcation according to collision

channel quantum numbers is not quite suﬃcient to establish a direct correspondence with the

standard spectroscopic notation employed in atomic structure calculations, or in the compiled

databases such as those by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).

The possible set of SLπs of a level is obtained from the target term, StLtπt, and the valence

electron angular momentum, l, at the ﬁrst occurance of the level in the set. The total spin

multiplicity of the level is deﬁned according to the energy level position as discussed above. For

example, the core 3d3(4F e) combining with a 4d electron forms the terms 5(P, D, F, G, H)e and

3(P, D, F, G, H)e (Table IV) where the quintet for each L should be lower than the triplet.

To each LS symmetry, SLπ, of the set belongs a set of predetermined J-levels. The set of

total J-values of same spin multiplicity is then calculated from all possible LS terms, equal to
|L + S|. The program sorts out all calculated ﬁne stucture levels with the same conﬁguration,
but with diﬀerent sets of Jt and J, e.g. (Ct St Lt Jt πtnℓ) J π (including the sign for the upper or

lower spin multiplicity), compares them with the predetermined set, and groups them together.

Thus a correspondence is made between the set of SLπ and the calculated ﬁne structure levels

of same conﬁguration.

In addition to the correspondence between the two sets, the program PRCBPID also calcu-

lates the possible set of SLπ’s for each single J-level in above group. In the set of SLπs, the

total spin is ﬁxed while the angular momentum, L, varies. In the above example for the quintets,

5(P, D, F, G, H)e, each J=1 level is assigned to a possible set of terms, 5(P, D, F ) (Table IV).

12

However, these levels can be futher identiﬁed uniquely following Hund’s rule that the term with

the larger angular momentum, L, is the lower one, i.e., the ﬁrst or the lowest J=1 level should

correspond to 5F , the second one to 5D and the last one to 5P .

The completeness of sets of ﬁne structure levels with respect to the LS terms are checked. As

mentioned above, PRCBPID determines the possible sets of SLπ from the target term and va-

lence electron angular momentum of a level at its ﬁrst occurance and calculates the total J-values

of the set of LS terms. The number of these J-values, N lv, is compared with that of calculated

levels, N cal to check the completeness. For example, for the above case of 5(P, D, F, G, H)e in

Table IV discussed above, 5P can have J = 1,2,3, 5D can have J = 0,1,2,3,4, and so on, giving

a total of 23 ﬁne structure levels for this set of LS terms. The one J = 0 level belongs to 5D,

the three J = 1 levels belong to 5(P, D, F ), and so on. All 23 levels of this set are found in

the computed levels (Table IV), thus making the computed set complete. This procedure, in

addition to ﬁnding the link between the two diiferent coupling schemes, enables an independent

counting of the number of levels obtained, and ascertains missing or mis-identiﬁed levels.

c) Transition probabilities

The oscillator strengths (f-values) and transition probabilites (A-values) for bound-bound ﬁne
structure level transitions in Fe V are calculated for levels up to J ≤ 8. Computations are carried
out using STGBB of the BPRM codes.

The f-values are initially calculated by the program STGBB with level designations given

by Jπ only. However, the transitions may be fully described following the level identiﬁcations as

described in the previous section. Work is in progress to identify all the transitions with proper

quantum numbers, conﬁgurations and possible SLπ’s.

A subset of the large number of transitions has been processed with complete identiﬁcations.

Among these transitions are those that correspond to the experimentally observed levels [23].

As these levels have been identiﬁed, their oscillator strenghts could be sorted out from the ﬁle of

f-values. Another subsidiary code, PRCBPRAD, is developed to reprocess the transition proba-

bilities where the calculated transition energies are replaced by the observed ones for improved

accuracy.

The computation time required for the BPRM calculations was orders of magnitude longer

13

compared to oscillator strengths calculations in LS coupling, as carried out under the OP for

example. The time excludes that needed for creating the necessary bound state wavefunctions

and calculating dipole matrix elements using the R-matrix package of codes. Computations are

carried out for one or a few pairs of symmetries at a time requiring several hours of CPU time

4. Results and discussion

Theoretical spectroscopic data are calculated on a large-scale with relativistic ﬁne structure

included in an ab initio manner, and ensuring completeness in terms of obtaining nearly all

possible energy levels and transition probabilities for Fe V for the total angular symmetries

considered. The results are described below.

a) Energy Levels

We have calculated 3,865 ﬁne structure bound levels, with 0 ≤ J ≤ 8, for Fe V. Following level
identiﬁcation, as explained in the previous section, the energy levels are arranged according to

ascending order in energy.

The present energies are compared with the relatively small set of experimentally observed

levels compiled by NIST [23] in Table III. All 179 observed levels are obtained and identiﬁed.

Asterisks attached to levels in Table III indicate an incomplete set of observed levels correspond-

ing to the LS term. Often in experimental measurements the weak lines are not observed. The

theoretical datasets on the other hand are usually complete.

We ﬁnd some discrepancies regarding the identiﬁcation of a couple of levels in the NIST

tabulation. The J = 2 level at 2.9395 Ry identiﬁed in the NIST table as 3d3(4P )4p(5So)2,

from the maximum leading percentage, may have been misidentiﬁed. Present analysis for the

completeness of a set of ﬁne structure levels belonging to a term indicates it as an extra level for

the given conﬁguration and that the possible LS terms for this level are 3d3(2D2)4p(3P DF o),

possibly 3F o. Similarly the NIST identiﬁcation for the J=3 level at 2.8968 Ry is 3d3(2P )4p(3Do)3,

from the maximum leading percentage. Present calculations however assign the level to possible

LS terms, 3d3(2D2)4p(3DF o), and most likely to 3Do.

14

In the computed set of ﬁne structure levels the observed levels are usually the ones with the

lowest energy in each subset of Jπ. The lowest calculated levels are the 34 levels of the ground

conﬁguration 3d4 of Fe V, in agreement with the observed ones. The agreement between the

observed and calculated energies for these levels is within 1%. The calculated energies agree to

about 1% with the measured ones for most of the observed levels. Although the energies are

exoected to be highly accurate, but the uncertainty in the calculations is not comparable to that

in spectroscopic observations (of the order of few wavenumbers).

Employing the completeness procedure the computed ﬁne structure levels are tabulated,

according to the two sets of cross-correlating quantum numbers: one according to the collision

channels identiﬁed as (CtSt Lt Jtπt nℓ [K]s) J π, and the other according to the complete set of

J-values for each multiplicity (2S + 1), L and π. A subset of the complete table of ﬁne structure

levels is presented in Table IV. (The complete table will be available electronically). Each set

of levels is grouped by the possible set of LS terms followed by the levels of same conﬁguration,

core term, total spin multiplicity and parity, and with diﬀerent J-values. The header for each

group contains the total number of possible J-levels, N lv, total spin multiplicity, parity, and all

possible L values formed from the core and the outer electron. The possible J-values for each

SLπ are given within parentheses next to each L value.

The two sets of quantum numbers are compared. The levels that may be missing or mis-

identiﬁed are thereby checked out. The number of computed levels, N cal, is compared with that

expected from angular and spin couplings, N lv. For most of the conﬁgurations the set of levels

is complete except for the high lying ones. The comparison detects missing levels. An example

is shown in the the set of 3d32(2D)5d3(S, P, D, F, G)e in Table IV where one level with J e = 4 is

missing.

In Table IV, the eﬀective quantum number ν is speciﬁed alongwith other quantum numbers

for each level. The consistency in ν =

z√(E−Et)

each set of levels may be noted.

, where Et is the corresponding target energy, for

The possible SLπs for each level are given in the last column. The levels with a single

possible term only are uniquely deﬁned. However, those with two or multiple term assignments

can be deﬁned uniquely applying Hund’s rule that the higher L corresponds to the lower energy

of same Jπ as explained in the previous section (we note that Hund’s rule may not always apply

15

in cases of strong CI).

There are 112 levels of odd parity that we could not properly identify. Some of these levels are

given in Table IV. These levels could be equivalent electron levels of conﬁguration, 3p5(2P o)3d5.

The 16 LS terms of 3d5, which are 2D1, 2P 3, 2D3, 2F 3, 2G3, 2H3, 4P 5, 4F 5, 2S5, 2D5, 2F 5,

2G5, 2I5, 4D5, 4G5, and 6S5, in combination with the parent core 2P o, form 88 LS terms with

31 singlets, 43 triplets, 13 quintets and 1 septet. The number of ﬁne structure levels from these

terms exceed the 112 computed levels that have not been identiﬁed.

This new procedure of cross-correlation between two coupling schemes thus provides a pow-

erful check on the completeness and level identiﬁcation, and is expected to be of use in further

BPRM work on complex atomic systems.

b) Transition Probabilities

The oscillator strengths (f-values) and transition probabilites (A-values) for ﬁne structure level
transitions in Fe V are obtained for J ≤ 8. The allowed ∆J = 0,±1 transitions include both the
dipole allowed (∆S = 0,±1) and the intercombination (∆S 6= 0) transitions. The total number
of computed transition probabilities is well over a million, approximately 1.46 × 106. For most
allowed pairs of Jπ symmetries, there are about 103 − 105 transitions.

As explained in the previous section, a subset of the encoded transitions have been processed

to present them with proper identiﬁcations. These correspond to the levels that have been

observed. A sample of these is presented in Table V. In all of the f-values presented the calculated

transition energy has been replaced by the observed one, using the BPRM line strengths (S)

which are energy independent. Since measured energies in general have smaller uncertainties

than the calculated ones, this replacement improves the accuracy of the oscillator strengths. The

transitions among the 179 observed levels correspond to 3727 oscillator strengths. (The complete

set of transition probabilities will be available electronically.)

The f-values in Table V have been reordered to group the transitions of the same multiplet

together. This enables a check on the completeness of the set of transitions. As this table

corresponds to transitions among observed levels only, the completeness depends on the set of

observed levels belonging to the LS terms. For the dipole allowed transitions, the LS multiplets

are also given at the end of jj ′ transitions.

16

To our knowledge, no measured f-values for Fe V are available for comparison. Current NIST

compilation [1] contains no f-values for any allowed transition. On the other hand, Fe V oscillator

strengths for a large number of transitions were obtined in the close coupling approximation

under the OP [24] and the IP [25]. Both of these datasets are non-relativistic calculations

in LS coupling and do not compute ﬁne structure transitions. Fawcett has [26] carried out

semi-empirical relativistic atomic structure calculations for ﬁne structure transitions in Fe V.

Comparison of the present f -values is made with the previous ones in Table VI, showing various

degrees of agreement. Present values agree within 10% with those by Fawcett for a number of ﬁne
structure transitions of multiplets, 3d4(5D) → 3d3(4F )4p(5Do), and 3d4(5D) → 3d3(4P )4p(5P o),
and the disagreement is large with other as well as with those of 3d4(5D) → 3d3(4F )4p(5F o).
The agreement of the present LS multiplets with the others is good for transitions 3d4(5D) →
3d3(4F )4p(5F o,5 Do,5 P o). More detailed comparisons will be made at the completion of this

work.

The procedure of substitution of experimental for calculated energies provides an indication

of uncertainties in the calculated f -values. The diﬀerence between the f -values obtained using

the calculated transition energies and the observed ones is only a few percents (< 5%) for most of

the allowed transitions. The diﬀerence is usually larger for the intercombination transitions which

have lower transition probabilities. In atomic structure calculations, it is possible to re-adjust

eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian to match the observed ones and then use the wavefunctions to

obtain the transition probabilities. Such a re-adjustment is not carried out in the BPRM calcu-

lations of bound states, which are entirely ab initio, with the associated advantage of consistent

uncertainties for most transitions considered.

To obtain an estimate of the accuracy of the wavefunctions employed in the length and the
velocity formulations, we plot, for example, the gf -values for transitions (J = 1)e − (J = 2)o
and (J = 3)e − (J = 4)o in Fig. 1. The top panel contains over 13,300 transitions between the
pair of symmetries (J = 1)e − (J = 2)o, and the bottom panel contains over 20,200 transitions
between the pair (J = 3)e − (J = 4)o. The plots show practically no dispersion for the strongest
transitions with gf ≈ 5 − 10, and some dispersion around 10-20% for others with gf < 3. Up
to gf < 0.1 the dispersion in length and velocity remains around the 10-20% level for most of

the transitions, although the number of outlying transitions increases with decreasing gf . Given

17

the large number of points in the ﬁgures, the relatively low dispersion of gfL and gfV indicates

that the f -values (gf divided by the statistical weight factor, 2J+1) for most of the transitions
with gf ∼1 should be within 20% uncertainty. The fL’s are usually more accurate than fV ’s
since the asymptotic region wavefunctions are more accurately represented in the close coupling

calculations using the R-matrix method.

In general the intercombination transitions are weaker than the dipole allowed ones; the

f-values can be orders of magnitude lower. The BP Hamiltonian in the present work (Eq. 2)

does not include the two-body spin-spin and spin-other-orbit terms of Breit interaction [22]. A

discussion of these terms is given by Mendoza et al. in a recent IP paper [27]. Their study on

the intercombination transitions in C-like ions shows that the eﬀect of the two-body Breit terms,

relative to the one-body operators, decreases with Z such that for Z = 26 the computed A-values

with and without the two-body Breit terms diﬀer by less than 0.5 %. However, the diﬀerences

towards the neutral end of the C-sequence is up to about 20%. It may therefore be expected that

for Fe V the weaker intercombination f-values may also be systematically aﬀected to a similar

extent (the uncertainties in the dipole allowed f-values should be much less). Further studies of

the Breit interaction in complex atoms are needed to ascertain this eﬀect more precisely.

Several aspects of the present work are targets for future studies, such as atomic structure

calculations to study the eﬀect of conﬁguration interaction and relativistic eﬀects on diﬀerent

types of transitions, and a detailed quantum defect analysis along interacting Rydberg series of

levels in intermediate coupling. These studies should provide information on the accuracy of

particular type of transitions and groups of levels, as well as address general problems in the

analysis of complex spectra.

5. Conclusion

The present work is the ﬁrst study of large-scale transition probabilities computed using the ac-

curate BPRM method for a highly complex ion. Some of the results obtained herein are expected

to form the basis for future computational spectroscopy of heretofore intractable complex atomic

systems using eﬃcient collision theory methods. The computational procedures developed for

such undertakings are described, and illustrative results are presented from the ab initio Breit-

18

Pauli R-matrix calculations for Fe V. Detailed analysis for the identiﬁcation of over 3,800 ﬁne

structure levels of Fe V is carried out using a combination of methods that include quantum de-

fect theory. Further work on the analysis of relativistic quantum defects in intermediate coupling

is planned.

Following the completion of all computations and identiﬁcations, the dataset of approx-

imately 1.5 million oscillator strengths will be described in another publication with a view

towards astrophysical and laboratory applications. In order to complete the dataset for practical

applications calculations are also in progress for the forbidden electric quadrupole and magnetic

dipole transition probabilties using the atomic structure program SUPERSTRUCTURE.

The newly acquired theoretical capability to obtain an essentially complete description of

radiative transitions for an atomic system should enable several new advances such as: (a) the

synthesis of highly detailed monochromatic opacity spectra [2], (b) the simulation of “quasi-

continuum” line spectra from iron ions [28], (c) high resolution spectral diagnostics of iron in

laboratory fusion and astrophysical sources, and (d) the analysis of experimentally measured

spectra of complex iron ions.

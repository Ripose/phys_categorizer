Abstract

We outline a non-perturbative procedure for calculating the total photoionization cross-section

of two-electron atomic systems. The procedure is based on the Floquet-Fourie representation of the

solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The Floquet-Fourie ansatz produces a set of

equations which is recast into a generalized eigenvalue problem by means of the complex rotation

procedure. With the use of the Hylleraas-type basis functions, the total photoionization cross-

sections are obtained within the accuracy of a fraction of a percent. The total photoionization cross-

sections for neutral helium are in good agreement with the convergent close-coupling calculations

of Kheifets and Bray [Phys. Rev. A 58, 4501 (1999)] but deviate notably from the experimental

data of Samson et al. [J. Phys. B 27 887 (1994)].

INTRODUCTION.

Photoionization of two-electron atoms has been studied theoretically by diﬀerent authors

starting from the pioneering paper by Wheeler [1]. Review of early literature on this subject

can be found in Ref. [2]. Subsequently, a large number of computations of helium photoion-

ization cross-sections was reported [3, 4, 5, 6]. These calculations produced a collection

of results varying typically by 5% from each other. On the experimental side, the bench-

mark set of data was reported by Samson et al. [7] who measured the total photoionization

cross-section of He in the photon energy range from the threshold to 120 eV. Agreement

between the theoretical and experimental data was within the same margin of 5%. In the

following years, the theoretical interest shifted towards calculation of diﬀerential character-

istics of the photoionization process and to studies of double photoionization. Here, several

approaches have been advocated including the many-body perturbation theory [6, 8], con-

vergent close-coupling method [9, 10], time-dependent close-coupling method [11, 12, 13],

R-matrix approach [14, 15], and methods based on the computation of the dipole response

function [16] or B-spline implementations of the exterior complex scaling [17].

Due to this shift of focus, there have been no further attempt to produce a consistent

set of photoionization cross-sections of He with an accuracy better than several percent.

Yan et al. [18] combined measurements of Samson et al. [7] at low energies and theoretical

calculations at high energies to construct a set of photoionization cross sections of He that

should be reliable at all energies. However, there was no consistency check applied to the

experimental data. In the meantime, accurate helium photoionization cross-sections would

be highly desirable due to importance of He in astrophysics and its use as a standard gas in

determination of the photoionizaiton cross-sections of other atomic and molecular species.

In the present paper, we develop the complex rotation method (CRM) for highly accurate

calculations of the total photoionization cross-section of two-electron atomic targets. One

way of calculating the photoionization cross-section is to combine the CRM technique with

the perturbation theory with respect to interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic

ﬁeld. In such a perturbation theory, the CRM provides the basis of the ﬁeld-free atomic

states. It was demonstrated by Johnson and Reinhardt [19] that relying on the spectrum of

2

the CRM eigenvalues, one can construct a representation of the complete Green’s function of

the atom. This, in turn, allows to write down a convenient representation for the projection

operator corresponding to the continuous spectrum of the atom [20]. Using this projection

operator, one can compute probabilities of transitions into continuum under the action

of some perturbation, in particular, the interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic

ﬁeld. Calculations of total photoionization cross-sections of the helium atom based on this

technique have been reported in Refs. [21, 22]. Similar ideas were also used to determine

static and dynamic polarizabilities of helium [23, 24].

In the present work, we use the CRM procedure in a somewhat diﬀerent, non-perturbative

way by applying it to the whole system the atom plus the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Thus, we

are capable of going beyond the perturbation theory and considering very strong ﬁelds.

In this respect, the present technique has certain features in common with Refs. [25, 26],

where an approach based on the conﬁguration interaction procedure was developed for atoms

with more than one electron. We cast our formalism using the language of square-integrable

functions with a ﬁnite norm. This approach becomes feasible in the so-called Floquet-Fourie

representation of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation.

Another key ingredient of the present work is the Hylleraas basis functions which have

long been used in various variational-type calculations. An excellent review of applications

of the Hylleraas basis to calculations of energies of two-electron atoms is given by Drake

[27]. A well-known trademark of the Hylleraas basis set is a very high accuracy of the

atomic energies.

In the present paper, we show that the same high accuracy which is

achieved for ﬁeld-free atomic states can also be attained when the atom is subjected to a

monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld. In particular, the total photoionization cross-sections

can be calculated with an accuracy of the order of a fraction of a percent.

Thus generated cross-sections were compared with the experimental results of Samson

et al. [7]. We discovered a systematic deviation from the experiment, especially in the

region close to double ionization threshold at the photon energies of ∼80 eV. This deviation

was conﬁrmed by comparison with earlier results produced by the convergent close-coupling

(CCC) method [28].

3

The true potential of the present method is realized in the strong ﬁeld regime where

the perturbation theory fails. As demonstrated below, the Floquet-Fourie-Hylleraas ansatz

produces very accurate results in this regime as well.

II. THEORY

A. General Theory.

The non-relativistic Hamiltonian of the helium atom in the presence of the external

monochromatic linearly-polarized electromagnetic ﬁeld can be written as :

(1)

(2)

(5)

where, ˆT is a kinetic term:

ˆH = ˆT + ˆU + ˆV ,

ˆT =

and ˆV describes interaction of atom and the ﬁeld. In the length gauge (which will be used

,

in the present paper), this operator assumes the form:

ˆV = F · D cos ωt,

with D = r1 + r2. Unless stated otherwise, the atomic units are used throughout the paper.

We write the solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) using the

Floquet-Fourie ansatz [29]

n
By substituting this expression into the TDSE and equating coeﬃcients with e−iEt−imwt, we

Ψ(t) = e−iEt

obtain a chain of coupled equations for the Floquet-Fourie coeﬃcients un:

(E − ˆT − ˆU + nω)un =

(un−1 + un+1) , n = 0, ±1 . . . ,

(6)

We solve this set of equations with the help of the complex rotation procedure [30, 31, 32, 33,

34, 35]. Formally, the CMR can be described as a complex transformation of radial variables

ri → rieiθ, where θ is the rotation angle, the sole parameter deﬁning the transformation.

Under this transformation, the chain of equations (6) is converted into

(E − ˆT e−2iθ − ˆU e−iθ + nω)un =

eiθ(un−1 + un+1) , n = 0, ±1 . . . ,

(7)

According to the general theory of CRM [30, 31, 32, 33], the set of equations (7) can be

solved by means of variational techniques if the rotation angle θ is properly chosen.

We introduce a basis set of square integrable functions |n, ki where the index n refers

to the number of the Floquet block and the index k denotes a particular L2 function in

the subspace of the n-th block so that un = X
Eqs.(7) can be rewritten in a matrix form as:

where it is understood that summation is carried over the repeated k-index. Here ˆV =

F ·D, and R, T and U stand for the overlap, kinetic energy and potential energy matrices,

respectively.

One could say here a few words about the choice of the basis allowed by the structure

of the system (9). Suppose ﬁrst, that in each of the subspaces corresponding to diﬀerent

Floquet blocks we chose some compete set of functions, such that for any un in Eq.(7) we

had: un = X cnm|n, mi. Let the set of |n, mi’s be the same for all Floquet subspaces.
Then, if we have retained N Floquet blocks in the system (7) and keep M terms in the

expansion for each un in Eq.(7) we have altogether NM unknowns cnm in the system (7).

To get a correctly posed eigenvalue problem, we should have the same number of equations.

This number is provided by projecting each of the equations (7) on one of the |n, mi’s

with m = 1 . . . M. This way of reducing the set of equations (7) to the form of matrix

eigenvalue problem is correct, but too general for our purposes. It can be seen, that one can

considerably diminish the resulting dimension of the matrix eigenvalue problem by using

certain symmetry properties of the system Eq.(7). It is easy to see, that this system allows

the following class of solutions: un’s with even n are of even parity, while un’s with odd

5

n are of odd parity. Parity here is understood with respect to the spatial inversion. Of

course, there is a class of solutions with the opposite property: un’s with even n are of odd

parity, while un’s with odd n are of even parity. The solution we are looking for (which is

to describe behavior of the even 1Se state of helium) evidently belongs to the ﬁrst class. We

can therefore, choose the basis set as follows.

Instead of choosing the same set |n, mi for each Floquet block, we choose two sets: a

set |neven, mi, consisting of basis ﬁnctions of even parity, is used as a basis to represent

un’s with even n’s. Another set |nodd, mi, composed of odd parity functions is used as a

basis to represent un’s with odd n’s. Suppose that in the expansions of un’s with even n’s

we retain Meven terms, and in the expansions of un’s with odd n’s - Modd terms. Let the

number of Floquet blocks with even and odd n’s be respectively Neven and Nodd. Than

we have NevenMeven + NoddModd unknown coeﬃcients cnm. We obtain the same number

of equations by projecting equations (7) on |neven, mi, m = 1 . . . Meven for even n and on

|nodd, mi, m = 1 . . . Modd for odd n. Projection of equations with even n on the |nodd, mi

and of equations with odd n on the |neven, mi gives identically zero and does not add new

equations. More details about the basis functions |neven, mi and |nodd, mi is given below.

According to the general theory of CRM, some of the energy values (generally complex)

for which system (9) has a solution are related to the position and width of the resonance

state via E = Er − iΓ/2, where Er is position of the resonance and Γ its width. This leads

one to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. Eﬀectiveness of ﬁnding eigenvalues of such

a problem depends crucially on the choice of the basis used to represent the matrices in

Eq.(9).

B. Basis set.

The basis set used in the present paper was constructed from the Hylleraas type functions:

gn1,n2,N (r1, r2) = rn1

1 rn2
2

|r1 − r2|N e−ar1−br2|l1(1)l2(2)Li,

(10)

6

where a,b are some constants (to be speciﬁed below), n1,n2,N are integers and the angular

part

|l1(1)l2(2)Li = X

m1m2

C LM

l1m1l2m2Yl1m1(n1)Yl2m2(n2),

(11)

represents two angular momenta l1, l2 coupled to a state with a total angular momentum

L. The basis functions (10) must also be properly symmetrized with respect to exchange of

the electron coordinates. When choosing parameters in Eq. (10), we followed the following

empirical rules [27, 36]. All the basis functions with the parameters satisfying:

n1 + n2 + N < Nmax

(12)

were included in the calculation. The parameter Nmax determines the overall size of the

basis. There is also a semiempirical rule for choosing angular momenta l1,l2 in the Eq.(10).

Thus, for states of the natural parity l1,l2 are best chosen so that l1 + l2 = L. Both these

criteria help to avoid the numerical problems due to near-degeneracy of the basis set when

its dimension becomes large.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Field-free case

In the present work, our main goal is to obtain accurate photoionization cross-sections

from the ground state of neutral helium for not very large electromagnetic ﬁeld intensities.

Accordingly, our main interest is focused on the states of S and P symmetries. Therefore,

our ﬁrst goal is to choose such a basis that solution of the eigenvalue problem (9) yields

accurate energies for the ground 1S and ﬁrst excited 1P o state of the helium atom in the

absence of the ﬁeld.

This goal was achieved as follows. We chose parameters Nmax = 18, a = b = 2 for the

S-states and Nmax = 13, a, b = 1, 2 for the P -states. The reason for enlarging the basis

set for the excited P -states is that the electrons in such states are generally on diﬀerent

distances from the nucleus. This choice combined with restriction on angular momenta (12)

resulted in NS = 372 basis functions for the S-states and NP = 660 basis functions for the

P -states.

7

The next step was to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for the ﬁeld-free case. In

Eq. (9) we put F = 0, ω = 0, and limited ourselves to the blocks with n = 0, n = ±1, the

n = 0 block being composed of the states of 1Se symmetry, and n = ±1 blocks composed of

the states of 1P o symmetry. All the numerical results reported below were obtained using

the quadruple precision arithmetics.

We note, that in the presence of the weak electromagnetic ﬁeld account of the blocks

with n = ±1 corresponds to absorption and emission of one photon. We shall use this fact

below to extract the photoionization cross-section from our calculation. For the moment,

we are concerned with testing the accuracy of our basis. Diagonalization of the eigenvalue

problem (9) with F = 0, ω = 0 in the basis described above produced the following results

for the complex energies: E = −2.903724384 + i 1.3 × 10−8 (the ground state) and E =

−2.123843094 + i 7.6 × 10−9 (1s2p1P o state). A small imaginary part which, in the absence

of the ﬁeld, should be zero could be taken as an indication of an accuracy of our basis set.

Either this criteria or a direct comparison with the well-known results of highly accurate

calculations [27] shows that we have achieved an accuracy of the order of 10−8 a.u. This

accuracy, as will be demonstrated below, is suﬃcient to obtain the photoionization cross-

sections with at least three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

B. Total photoionization cross sections

To calculate the total photoionization cross sections we adopted the following strategy.

The eigenvalue problem (9) was solved with the Floquet blocks n = 0, ±1 retained, the

composition of each block was the same as described above for the ﬁeld-free case. Diagonal-

ization of the eigenvalue problem (9) produced energy shift and total width for the ground

state. By deﬁnition, the photoionization cross-section from this state is related to the total

width Γ via

σ = lim
F →0

8παΓω/F 2,

(13)

where F is ﬁeld strength, ω its frequency, α is the ﬁne structure constant. We need therefore

to extract from our calculation the coeﬃcient with F 2 in the asymptotic law deﬁning the

weak-ﬁeld behavior of the width:

Γ(F ) = Γ0F 2 + Γ1F 3 + . . .

(14)

To implement this strategy, we need an extrapolation procedure since the calculation based

on the system (9) is performed for a non-zero ﬁeld strength. Although ﬁnite, this ﬁeld

strength should not be too small to compute Γ with suﬃcient accuracy.

The issue of accuracy can be addressed as usual in variational-type calculations, by merely

increasing the basis size and verifying that the results do not change appreciably. Such a test

was performed for a photon energy ω = 80 eV and a ﬁeld strength F = 0.1 a.u. by varying

the parameter Nmax in Eq.(12) for the S and P states. The diagonalization of the problem

(9) was performed with the Floquet blocks n = 0, ±1 retained. All the remaining details of

the basis (nonlinear parameters etc.) were the same as in the ﬁeld-free case reported above.

The calculation was performed for the value of the rotation angle θ = 0.3.

The test results are presented in Table I. One can observe that, just as in the ﬁeld-

free case, the accuracy is on the level of 10−8 a.u., which implies that Γ has at least four

signiﬁcant digits in this interval of ﬁeld strengths.

The issue of the stability of the results with respect to the number of the Floquet blocks

included in diagonalization of (9) is addressed in the next section where we consider eﬀects of

going beyond the ﬁrst order perturbation theory. We shall say in advance that including the

Floquet blocks with n = ±2 in diagonalization of (9) does not alter the numerical accuracy

appreciably.

As to the extrapolation procedure needed to extract the coeﬃcient Γ0 in Eq.(14), we

chose a scheme based on the three-point Lagrange formula. For each frequency reported

below, we performed calculations for the ﬁeld strengths F = 0.07, 0.1, 0.13a.u. We also used

a mid size basis set with N S

max = 18, N P

max = 12, Floquet blocks with n = 0, ±1, all other

details of the basis are the same as in the ﬁeld-free case above. Results of this calculation

and extrapolation are shown in Table II.

Using an estimate for the remainder of the series (14), it is a simple matter to verify that

for the ﬁeld strengths considered the possible relative error introduced by the extrapolation

of Γ/F 2 is of the order of 0.1%. Hence, at least three digits in our result for the extrapolated

ratio Γ/F 2 and the cross-sections reported below must be reliable. This level of accuracy can

easily be improved by merely going to extrapolation schemes of higher order and computing

Γ for more ﬁeld values.

In Table III we present our results for the cross-sections based on formula (13) in which we

fed the extrapolated ratios from the last column of Table II. Along with our data, we present

the benchmark experimental results of Samson et al. [7] as well as earlier theoretical results

from Ref. [28]. The experimental setup of Samson et al. [7] was such that the measured cross-

section was summed over all ﬁnal states of the remaining ion including the doubly ionized

states. It is exactly the cross-section that is calculated presently and therefore comparison

between the theory and experiment should be straightforward.

Our theoretical results agree with the data of Samson et al. [7] within the postulated

experimental accuracy of few percents. The strongest deviation is for ω = 80 eV where the

diﬀerence between the present result and the experimental value is 6%. This is deviation is

clearly seen in the Figure where we plot the present Floquet calculation along with the CCC

calculation in three gauges of the lectromagnetic interaction and the experiment. Agreement

between the present calculation and that of the CCC is much better, diﬀerence of the results

of two approaches not exceeding 1%. The accuracy of the CCC result is hard to estimate

directly as this method relies on the numerical solution of a set of close-coupling equations.

The only implicit indication is the diﬀerence between the cross-sections calculated in the

three gauges of the electromagnetic interaction, the length (L), velocity (V) and acceleration

(A). This diﬀerence is typically 1-2%. Thus, the deviation of the present calculation with

the CCC is more likely to be the problem of the latter as the former is believed to be much

As a by-product of the calculation described above, we also obtained the shift of the

ground state of helium due to the interaction of atom with the linearly polarized monochro-

more accurate.

C. Extended calculation

We now turn to extended calculations with inclusion of a larger number of the Floquet

blocks n = 0, ±1, ±2 in Eq. (9). The aim of these calculations is two-fold. First, we shall

conﬁrm the stated accuracy of the present weak ﬁeld results which is not eﬀected by the

number of the Floquet blocks retained in the calculation. Second, we report some preliminary

results concerning behavior of the widths parameter in stronger ﬁelds where inclusion of a

larger number of the Floquet blocks becomes essential due to a non-perturbative nature of

the processes involved.

The basis for the extended calculations was constructed as follows. As we discussed above

the basis subset spanning each Floquet block in the system (9) can be chosen to consist of

the functions of a given parity, two adjacent blocks having opposite parities. Thus, in the

low-ﬁeld calculations described above, the block n = 0 was composed of even basis functions

while two blocks with n = ±1 contained odd basis functions. Inclusion of the blocks with

n = ±2 is, therefore, equivalent to adding more even basis functions. We did it in the

following way. In addition to the 1Se states we previously had in the n = 0 block, the states

of the symmetries 1De and 1P e were included in the calculation. Thus the blocks with n = 0

and n = ±2 had the following composition: Nmax = 18 for the 1Se-basis functions, Nmax = 8

for the 1P e and 1De-basis functions. As before, the blocks with n = ±1 were composed

of basis functions of 1P o-symmetry with Nmax = 13. Thus, the basis set is considerably

enlarged comparing to the one used in the previous section. With this choice of parameters

Nmax, the overall dimension of the eigenvalue problem (9) was 2676. Results produced for

the ground state of He by diagonising this eigenvalue problem are shown in Table V

Comparison of the results given in Table V supports the assertion we made in the previous

section as to the accuracy of our results for the widths. As one can see, for the ﬁeld strengths

F ≈ 0.1 a.u., inclusion of the additional Floquet blocks and basis states of symmetries other

than S and P produces relative variations in the widths on the order of 0.01 percent.

This means that for such ﬁeld values we are still within the domain of the validity of

the perturbation expansion. For the frequencies presented in the Table the domain of the

perturbation theory actually extends quite far in the region of large ﬁeld strengths. As one

can see from the Table (V), the ratio Γ/F 2 starts changing in a more or less appreciable

manner only for ﬁeld strengths as large as F ≈ 1 a.u.

IV. CONCLUSION

We performed a calculation of the total photoionization cross-sections from the ground

state of helium. We employed a theoretical procedure based on the Floquet-Fourie repre-

sentation of the solutions of the TDSE describing the helium atom in the presence of the

linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld. The resulting set of Floquet equa-

tions was cast into a generalized eigenvalue problem by the complex rotation method. Our

approach is essentially non-perturbative. This is in contrast with other works [20, 22] where

the CRM was used to produce an accurate description of the ﬁeld-free helium atom, thus

giving the ground for application of the perturbation theory. In our approach, we do not rely

14

on any perturbation expansion to describe interaction of the atom and the electromagnetic

ﬁeld. This interaction is included into the theory from the beginning. We would like to

emphasize the accuracy of the present results for the photoionization cross-sections which,

we believe, is on the level of a fraction of a percent. Although only few selected photon

energies were reported in the paper, far wider and denser energy grid was covered by the

present calculation. These results might serve as an accurate database and ﬁnd their use in

various astrophysics and atomic physics applications. The authors shall gladly communicate

these data on request.

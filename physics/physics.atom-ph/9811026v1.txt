Identiﬁcation of Beutler-Fano formula in eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays near a
resonance

Chun-Woo Lee
Department of Chemistry, Ajou University, 5 Wonchun Dong, Suwon 442-749, KOREA

Eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays near a resonance for a system of one discrete state and two
continua are shown to be functionals of the Beutler-Fano formula using appropriate dimensionless
energy units and line proﬁle indices. Parameters responsible for the avoided crossing of eigenphase
shifts and eigentime delays are identiﬁed. Similarly, parameters responsible for the eigentime delays
due to a frame change are identiﬁed. With the help of new parameters, analogy with the spin
model is pursued for the S matrix and time delay matrix Q. The S matrix is found to be put into
exp[i(a + bσ
~σ)
·
where the ﬁrst term is the time delay due to resonance, the second term is the one due to avoided
crossing interaction and the last term is the one due to a frame change. It is found that P 2

Resonances observed in the energy-dependence of atomic and molecular processes often correspond to an autoion-
ization or predissociation observed in photo-absorption, i.e., to the excitation of a quasi-bound state in a continuum
region [1,2]. Their spectra are characterized by rich proﬁles providing a wealth of information on the atomic and
molecular dissociation or ionization processes. Beutler’s early observation of rare-gas levels auto-ionizing into a single
continuum with angular-momentum conservation was reproduced by Fano through the formula [3]:

where ǫ is the reduced energy deﬁned by 2(E

life time of the quasi-bound state, respectively; σ0 represents the photo-fragmentation cross section to the continuum
q is employed instead of the usual +q). Extension

of Beutler-Fano formula to the dissociation into multi-channels was obtained by Combet-Farnoux [4]. The energy
dependence of S matrix near an isolated resonance for such predissociation or autoionization into multi-channels was
obtained long ago and well known [5]. By diagonalizing S matrix, eigenphase shifts δi (i=1,2,...n) are obtained from
its eigenvalues as

−

−

and utilized frequently as a tool for analyzing the resonances [6,7]. Eigenphase shifts and corresponding eigenchannels
are also extensively used in various forms in Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory which is regarded as one of the
most general and powerful theories of resonance [1].

In contrast to photo-fragmentation cross sections and S matrix, the analytical formulas for eigenphase shifts in
multichannel processes are not known. According to the numerical studies, eigenphase shifts in the multichannel
system are known as showing complicated behaviors near a resonance due to the avoided crossing between curves
of eigenphase shifts along the energy [6,8]. Such a phenomenon of the avoided crossing along the energy is not
conspicuous in case of the formulas for photo-dissociation cross sections and S matrices. We report here the detailed
studies on the behaviors of eigenphase shifts and also times delayed by a collision [9,10] for the system of one discrete
state and two continua, which turn out to be described by functionals of the Beutler-Fano formula. Their behaviors
in the system of one discrete state and one continuum are already studied [3]. If one more continuum is added to that
system, there enter new phenomena of avoided crossing between curves of eigenphase shifts and eigentimes delayed
and of times delayed due to a frame change along the energy besides the resonance behavior. The avoided crossing
interactions between eigenphase shifts along the energy always take place near a resonance if they are not excluded
for symmetry reasons, as we will see in the later section. The addition of more continua may simply introduce more
avoided crossings among the newly added eigenphase shifts. In this sense, the current system of one discrete state
and two continua may serve as a prototype system for the study of the eﬀects of avoid crossings between eigenphase
shifts and times delayed due to the frame change on the resonance phenomena.

1

The import of the current work may be in the ﬁndings of the new parameters for the avoided crossing interaction,
where S matrix can be put into a form of eiH with H hermitian and the time delay matrix (or life time matrix as
~σ where ~P is a polarization vector and ~σ is the Pauli matrix.
called by Smith [10]) can be put into a form of 1 + ~P
The analogy with the spin system under a magnetic ﬁeld is exploited to ﬁnd further properties of S matrix and time
delay matrix.

·

Section II describes the known properties of eigenphase shifts. Section III describes the form of S matrix near
a resonance and the equation for eigenphase shifts. It also discusses some special cases and general characteristics
of eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays. Sec. IV obtains the formulas of eigenphase shifts as functionals of the
Beutler-Fano formula for the system of one discrete state and two continua. Sec. V obtains the formulas of eigentime
delays as functionals of Beutler-Fano formula.

II. KNOWN PROPERTIES OF EIGENPHASE SHIFTS

It is well known that , for an isolated resonance in single channel scattering, the energy dependence of a phase shift,

δ(E), is described by the following formula [1]

tan[δ(E)

δ0] =

−

Γ
2(E0 −

ǫ

,

−

E)

where δ0, E0 and Γ denote the background phase shift, the energy and the width of the resonance, respectively. The
second equality in Eq. (3) deﬁnes the dimensionless energy. It can be deduced from Eq. (3) that δ(E) increases slowly
except for the narrow energy range around E0 where its value undergoes a rapid change and is eventually increased
by π as energy varies from
. Due to the property of tangent function, δ(E) can be determined only up to
nπ (n integer). It is usually taken to be δ0 at E
. In the absence of
resonance, δ is equal to δ0. The background phase shift δ0 is a slowly varying function of energy and usually taken
to be constant as a good approximation. Thus, the increase of δ(E) around E0 solely comes from resonance. Let us
denote the diﬀerence between δ(E) and δ0 by δr(E). With this notation, Eq. (3) becomes tan δr(E) = tan ¯δr(ǫ) =
, it can be transformed as follows

1/ǫ, and with the mentioned phase convention of setting δ(E) to δ0 at E =

III. EQUATIONS FOR EIGENPHASE SHIFTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF RESONANCE

The form of S matrix in the neighborhood of an isolated resonance in multichannel processes is well known and
repeatedly derived in the past using various resonance theories [2,5]. Though its form is basically same for all resonance
theories, its detailed expressions may look diﬀerently from theory to theory. Here, Fano’s conﬁguration interaction
theory is adopted for the treatment of resonance [3]. In the conﬁguration interaction theory, an isolated resonance
in multichannel system is treated as regarding the system as composed of one discrete state φ and many continuum
In other words, it is assumed that continuum

Equating the real and imaginary parts, Eq. (21) yields two relations: one is Macek’s formula and the other one is
k Γk = Γ. This derivation of Macek’s formula is simpler than the original one. The Sardi’s form is given as a
polynomial of order n and more convenient than Macek’s formula in obtaining the solution. In particular, it shows
P
explicitly that the number of roots of Macek’s formula is the same as the number of continua, n. We will use it in
the next section to obtain the solution for the system of one discrete state and two continua. Before doing that, let
us comment on the general properties of eigenphase shifts obtainable from the Macek’s formula.

From Macek’s formula, we could draw two properties of eigenphase shifts. Firstly, its diﬀerentiation with respect

n becomes larger than π, it is shifted by

n and that they are all in the range of [0,π], for simplicity, which can be always
done without loosing generality by the Hazi’s formula (6). Then, the above two properties on eigenphase shifts tell us
that eigenphase shifts vary between two asymptotic values of their abscissas given by [δ0

If δ0

shows the resonance behavior and increases by π around resonance, each eigenphase shift should similarly show up
the resonance behavior between two consecutive asymptotes of the abscissas [δ0
(i = 1, . . . , n). When the
consecutive eigenphase shifts are the same, let us say δ0

(the notations δr and δa without the bar are also used elsewhere if it is desired to express them in terms of E instead
of ǫr). The phase shift ¯δr in the ﬁrst term is the one due to the resonance as already mentioned in Eq. (4). In single
channel scattering, it is the only term besides the background phase shift contributing to the eigenphase shifts near
a resonance. In two channel scattering, there enters another phase shift ¯δa deﬁned by the second term due to the
indirect coupling of two continua via quasi-bound state near a resonance.

The functional dependence of ¯δa(ǫr) on energy may be best seen by considering its cotangent like cot δr =

With these parameters, Eq. (32) becomes 2(E

and will be denoted as ǫa:

By substituting Eqs. (32) and (35) into (31), we obtain

it is parameterized in terms of ǫa and qa. Since we want Γa to be positive, it will be assumed that sin ∆0
0, which
can always be achieved by the appropriate choice of 1 and 2 for δ0
2. With this convention in mind, Γa will be
written as 2√Γ1Γ2/

Using Eq. (6), the above equation may be expressed in terms of the eigenphase sum δΣ(E)

The eigenphase sum δΣ(E) consists of the background eigenphase sum δ0
Σ and the phase shift δr(E) due to the
resonance. The phase shifts due to the resonance contribute positively from zero to π as energy varies around a
resonance. The phase shift is positive since particles are attracted and bound temporarily near a resonance. The

Since the avoided crossing point energy Ea corresponds to zero of ǫa [see the discussion below Eq. (45)], qa tells how
the avoided crossing point energy is apart from the middle of two asymptotes of the abscissas. Such an apartness is
a measure of the asymmetry of the curves of ˜δa(ǫa). Fig. 1 shows the variations in the behaviors of δa and δ
as qa

So far, we obtained eigenvalues of S matrix for two open channels near a resonance and decomposed them into
contributions from the background, resonance, and avoided crossing interactions. Let us now consider obtaining the
eigenvectors of S matrix which are usually called eigenchannels. S matrix is diagonalized in two steps. It is ﬁrst
transformed to A by U 0 which diagonalizes S0 matrix, i.e., S = U 0A
U 0). A is then diagonalized
as in Eq. (14) by V matrix which is composed of two eigenvectors v+ and v

corresponding to δ+ and δ

(cid:18)
at ǫa = 0 or at E = E0 + ∆Γ
12, two eigenphase shifts are avoided most. For this reason ǫa = 0 is considered
as the avoided crossing point energy. (Another way to see that ǫa = 0 is the avoided crossing point energy might be
to remove the cause of the avoidance of two eigenphase shift curves and to let them cross through each other and to
see whether the crossing point is ǫa = 0. This was done and ǫa = 0 is conﬁrmed to be the crossing point.)

Notice that τa and τf are added up incoherently to eigentime delays. Also because of tr(σi) = 0 (i=x,y,z),

that is, the eigentime delay sum has the same form as that of the eigentime delay in the single channel scattering [16].

It takes the Lorentzian form and is thus always positive or delayed as it is kept temporarily by the quasi-bound state.

Interestingly, ¯τa takes the Beutler-Fano formula in the energy scale of ǫr instead of ǫa in contrast to the case of ˜δa,

ga changes its sign at ǫr = qτ , so does the polarization vector ~Pa at the same energy. The study on Pa as a function
1/qτ and a minimum of 0 at ǫr = qτ

1/qa where δa has an extremum). Fig. 2 shows the variations in the behaviors of

Because of the inequality (22), the above equation should be larger than or equal to zero, which proves (80). This
inequality is the manifestation of the physical fact that eigenphase shifts are increasing functions of energy in the
neighborhood of a resonance as colliding particles are kept bound temporarily around a resonance (attractive forces
make positive phase shifts).

The above inequality restricts the magnitude of Pa to 0

Pa ≤
1. The magnitude of Pa causes the diﬀerence
between two eigentimes delayed. Eq. (79) tells us that the degree of diﬀerence in two eigentime delays is governed
1). Then since r2 is symmetric with respect to x = 1
by r2. Let us consider r2 as a function of x = Γ1/Γ (0

avoided crossing interaction is strongest at x = 1
2 , the diﬀerence in two eigentimes delayed due to an avoided crossing
interaction completely disappears when the avoided crossing interaction is strongest.

As in the case of τa, Pf is smaller than or equal to unity. This can be proved by examining the behavior of the

graph of Pf as a function of ǫr. Pf can be easily transformed as a function of ǫr by substituting

for ǫa into Eq. (83). It is then diﬀerentiated with respect to energy to yield the roots of the ﬁrst derivative of ¯τf (ǫr)

This means that eigentime delays for the system of one discrete state and two continua are zero and τr(ǫr). Though
time delays due to the avoided crossing interaction and frame change are asymmetric with respect to the resonance
energy and therefore the energy of the longest lifetime does not match with the resonance energy, the energy of the
longest overall eigentimes delayed is exactly matched with the resonance energy.

Let us summarize the results. In this paper, we considered eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays near a resonance
for a system of one discrete state and two continua using Fano’s conﬁguration interaction theory. The eigenphase
shifts are obtained as

where δr(E) is the phase shift due to the modiﬁcation of the scattering wave by the quasi-bound state and given by
arctan(1/ǫr) and δa(E) is the one due to the modiﬁcation of the scattering wave by the other wave through the

−
indirect interaction via the quasi-bound state and given as a functional of the Beutler-Fano formula:

In the above formula, energy is expressed in the unit of Γa = 2√Γ1Γ2/
and shifted from the reso-
nance energy E0 by ∆Γ
12. The shape of the curve of δa(E) is characterized by the line proﬁle index
12). The strength of the avoided crossing interaction felt by the eigenphase shifts is
qa =
governed by the magnitude of Γa. No shift is expected when Γ1 equals Γ2, where the strength of the avoided crossing
interaction is strongest. The maximum shift obtains when either Γ1 or Γ2 is zero.

Eigenvectors are independent of qa. They depend only on ǫa. Since qa stands for the apartness of the avoided crossing
point energy from the middle of asymptotes of the abscissas of two eigenphase shifts, the above result means that
the characteristics of avoided crossing interactions are independent of the asymptotes of the abscissas of eigenphase
shifts. The corresponding eigenvectors of S matrix are obtained by replacing θa with θ′a = θa + 2θ0.

the one due to the resonance, the one due to the avoided crossing interaction, and the one due to the change of frame
as a function of energy. Because of the last term, eigenfunctions of Q matrix are diﬀerent from those of S matrix.

The time delay due to the resonance takes a symmetric Lorentzian form and the time delay due the to avoided

crossing takes a form of a functional of the Beutler-Fano formula:

The asymmetry of τa as a function of energy is brought about by the nonzero value of qτ which is proportional to
the shift of the avoided crossing point energy from the resonance one. Thus the asymmetry of τa is caused by the
mismatch in the positions of the avoided crossing point and resonance energies.

The above form may be understood from the fact that the changes of the frame spanned by the eigenvectors of S
matrix is governed by 1 + ǫ2
a while the time delay due to the resonance is governed by 1 + ǫ2
r. Therefore the ratio of τa
to τr will be a function of (1 + ǫ2
a). τf (E) is also found to be transformed into a functional of the Beutler-Fano
formula.

In the present case a complete depolarization means that eigentimes delays are the same regardless of eigenchannels,
while a complete polarization means that eigentime delays are 0 and τr(E) as a function of energy. Eigenvectors for
eigentime delays due to an avoided crossing interaction and due to a frame change are orthogonal to each other and
f = 1. This means that
contribute to the total eigentime delays as
one among two total eigentime delays is zero while the other one is the same as the time delayed by the resonance state.

resonance energy and therefore the energy of the longest lifetime not matched with the resonance energy, the energy
of the longest overall eigentimes delayed is exactly matched with the resonance energy. Though this is a surprising
result, it should rather be so if we recall that all the partial life times obtained from the partial photo-dissociation
cross sections as a function of energy are the same in the system of one discrete state and many continua. But the
detailed study on their connection is beyond the scope of this paper.

Present work reveals the dynamical parameters that govern the behaviors of eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays
for the system of one discrete state and two continua. It may be applied to the systems of more than two continua
by approximating that such systems are a cascade of independent two interacting continua. In that sense, current
study may be considered as a prototype model for the “isolated” avoided crossing interaction. For the system of one
discrete state and three or four continua, Eq. (19) becomes third and fourth order equation and its solution can be
obtained by the Cartan and Ferrari’s method. It may be highly desirable to do the similar studies on these systems.

Abstract

We describe a modiﬁcation of the inverted perturbation approach method allowing to construct

physically sensible potential energy curves for electronic states of diatomic molecules even when

some parts of the potential are not adequately characterized by the experimental data. The method

is based on a simple regularization procedure, imposing an additional constraint on the constructed

potential curve.

In the present work it is applied to the double minimum 41Σ+

u state of Na2,

observed experimentally by polarization labeling spectroscopy technique.

INTRODUCTION

Perhaps the most challenging among the electronic states of diatomic molecules are those

characterized by exotic shapes of the potential energy curves, which may exhibit barriers

towards dissociation, unusual bends or shelves as well as multiple minima. Most of these

features reﬂect interactions between the initially regular diabatic molecular states which, if

belonging to the same irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the molecule, in

the adiabatic approach cannot cross each other. Except of satisfying a natural, fundamen-

tal interest, investigation of such states can bring an immediate, twofold proﬁt. First, the

complicated shape of the exotic curves is very sensitive to relative positions of the original

diabatic potentials. Therefore experimentally determined curves provide particularly rigor-

ous tests of the quality of theoretical calculations. Second, it happens frequently that exotic

potential wells are unusually wide. Such a well can be employed then as an intermediate

state to access the long range region of other states situated below or above it.

The unusual electronic states require special methods of analysis and reduction of the

experimental data to potential energy curves.

In the simplest instance of regular Morse-

like potentials, the standard Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) algorithm [1], based on the Bohr-

Sommerfeld quantization of the phase integral for the vibrational motion, is used. This

algorithm can also be generalized to treat some “irregular” curves [2, 3], but evidently

fails in the case of double minimum potentials. As an alternative the variational inverted

perturbation approach (IPA) has been developed [4], providing fully quantum mechanical

determination of potential energy curves directly from the experimental data. In this pro-

cedure, one starts with some estimated approximate potential curve and iteratively seeks

corrections to it until the quantum mechanical eigenenergies calculated from the improved

curve agree with the experimental term values in the least squares approximation (LSA)

sense. Several routines have been proposed for realization of this idea, diﬀering mainly in

mathematical representation of the potential [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In most of them analytical

expressions of various forms [5, 7, 8, 9, 10] allow to accurately describe potential energy

curves with few ﬁtting parameters, but up to now they have been designed to deal only with

“regular” potentials with a Morse-like shape.

The pointwise representation of the potential, proposed within the framework of the

IPA method by Pashov et al. [6], is more general. As an essentially model-free approach,

2

it imposes no limitation on the shape of the ﬁtted curve and therefore can be applied to

both ”regular” and ”irregular” potential energy curves [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. However,

the pointwise approach has also disadvantages following from its model-free nature. The

method works well for the parts of the potentials covered by abundant experimental data

(i.e. energies of rovibrational levels), but when the experimentally determined energy levels

become sparse, the inversion problem starts to be highly ill-conditioned and the procedure

may become unstable, producing irregularities in a form of unphysical wiggles on the con-

structed potential curve. In the original algorithm [6] the problem was partially solved by

using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique [17] instead of the standard LSA for

ﬁtting the molecular potential. Additional smoothing of the potential resulted from using

a cubic spline function for interpolation between the points deﬁning the potential energy

curve; increasing the grid spacing could reduce the undesirable ﬂexibility of the constructed

curve. Nevertheless in some cases ﬁtting a smooth potential to few experimental data turned

out to be nontrivial and even tricky.

We have recently encountered such a problem when investigating the 41Σ+

u state in Na2

molecule. To the best of our knowledge this state has escaped experimental characterization

up to now. The 1Σ+ states in alkali dimers are expected to show an intricate system

of avoided crossings between diﬀerent Rydberg and valence states at short internuclear
distances and also ion-pair states (Na+Na−) at long internuclear distances. In particular,
for the 41Σ+

u state under consideration the theoretical calculations predict a double minimum

potential, with a deep inner well and a shallow but broad outer one, in addition to a clearly

visible inﬂection in the right-hand wall of the inner well. Our experimental data related

to the 41Σ+

u state contained 277 energies of levels located in the inner well; they allowed

us to ﬁnd the detailed shape of this well. On the other hand, only 55 levels have been

observed in the region above the potential barrier, whereas the outer potential well was

totally inaccessible in the present experiment. Therefore determination of the outer well

turned out to be an ill-posed problem. We have shown, however, that a physically sensible

solution can be found by application of a simple but eﬀective regularization procedure,

based on an additional constraint imposed on a constructed potential. As a result, a smooth

potential energy curve corresponding to a broad range of internuclear distances (2.4 to 20.0
˚A) has been generated, reproducing energies of all experimental rovibronic levels to within

the experimental accuracy and displaying the expected physical behavior.

In Section II we present the experimental setup and techniques used. Section III contains

a brief description of the recorded spectra. The basic concepts of the inverted perturbation

approach as well as the proposed modiﬁcation of the algorithm are discussed in Section IV

and their application to deduction of the potential energy curve for the 41Σ+

u state is shown

in Section V. Finally, Section VI summarizes our results.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

To study the 41Σ+

u ← X1Σ+

g system in Na2, we employed the V-type optical-optical

double resonance polarization labeling spectroscopy technique with two independent pump

and probe light beams. In our version of the method the probe beam had a ﬁxed frequency

and excited a few assigned molecular transitions, whereas the pump beam was tuned over

an investigated spectrum. The experimental apparatus and method have been described

in detail elsewhere [18, 19] and therefore only the essential features will be presented here.

Na2 molecules were produced in a heatpipe oven, operating at around 750 K, with 4 Torr of

helium as a buﬀer gas. The pump and probe light beams were superimposed collinearly in

the sodium vapor zone. As a probe light we employed one of the ﬁve blue-green lines of a

linearly polarized multimode Ar+ laser (Carl Zeiss ILM 120, λ = 476.5, 488.0, 496.5, 501.7

and 514.5 nm), with a typical power ranging from 20 to 150 mW. The probe laser light excited

several known transitions in the B1Πu ← X1Σ+

g system of sodium dimer [20], thus labeling the

involved rovibrational levels in the ground electronic state. A parametric oscillator/ampliﬁer

system (Sunlite EX, Continuum) provided with a frequency doubler (FX-1) and pumped

with the third harmonic of an injection seeded Nd:YAG laser (Powerlite 8000) served as a

source of the pump light. The system produced UV radiation with a typical energy 3 mJ per
pulse and a spectral width of 0.16 cm−1. The tunable pump light excited sodium molecules
from the ground X1Σ+

u state studied in this experiment. The frequency

g state to the 41Σ+

of the pump beam was calibrated against the optogalvanic spectrum of argon in a hollow

cathode discharge tube and the transmission fringes of a Fabry-P´erot interferometer 0.5 cm

long. The uncertainty in determining the line centers for strong molecular lines is estimated
to 0.05 cm−1.

Crossed polarizers were placed at both sides of the heatpipe oven in the path of the probe

beam. At the frequencies at which transitions induced by the pump beam shared the same

signal was recorded with a photomultiplier and processed with a computer. For measure-

ments of polarization spectra labeled via P or R transitions, the pump beam was circularly

polarized; for polarization spectra labeled via Q transitions, the linear polarization of the

pump beam was chosen [21].

III. RESULTS

We recorded the polarization spectrum of the 41Σ+

g system of Na2 in a range
between 32100 and 35100 cm−1. Fig. 1 shows a particularly interesting fragment of the
spectrum where an abrupt change of vibrational spacing in the observed v′ progression

u ← X1Σ+

corresponds to transition from the inner well to a region above the potential barrier. The

analyzed spectral lines provided information about 332 rovibrational levels in the 41Σ+
u

state. The data ﬁeld is illustrated in Fig. 2. The highest vibrational level identiﬁed by us
corresponds to v′ = 77 (vide infra) whereas the rotational quantum numbers J ′ are spread
between 12 and 56. Assignment of v′ = 0 level was based on an assumption that this

was the lowest level observed. After Franck-Condon factors for transitions from the ground

X1Σ+

g state were calculated, comparison of them with the measured relative strengths of the

spectral lines conﬁrmed the assignment. It must be noted that the outer well in 41Σ+

u was

inaccessible in the present experiment because of negligible overlap between vibrational wave

functions located there and those corresponding to the ground state levels. The measured

wave numbers of lines have been converted to energies of 41Σ+

u state levels referred to the

bottom of the X1Σ+

g state potential well, using the ground state molecular constants of

Kusch and Hessel [20]. As they reproduce energies of the rovibrational levels in the ground

state with an accuracy exceeding the precision of our measurements, no additional errors

were introduced into our analysis of the 41Σ+

u state.

IV. THE IPA ALGORITHM USING A POINTWISE POTENTIAL AND ITS

MODIFICATION

The main idea of the IPA is to start with an approximate potential energy curve U0(R, a)
i . The ﬁtting parameters a = (a1, a2, ..., aM ) are
with eigenenergies E0
used in order to modify U0(R, a) in such a way that its new eigenenergies Ei agree with the
experimental ones Eexp

in the LSA sense [4]. If the approximate potential is close to the

i and eigenfunctions Ψ0

“true” one, we can assume a linear dependence of the eigenenergies on small changes of the

In order to parametrize the molecular potential we use an equidistant grid of points

(Rk, uk) connected with a cubic spline function [6]. Values of the potential at R = Rk, that

is uk, are ﬁtting parameters. In this case it is possible to show [6] that

where ∆uj is the correction to the j-th ﬁtting parameter. Replacing Ei with Eexp

provides a

i

set of N linear equations (N denotes the number of experimental levels) with M unknowns

(where M is the number of the ﬁtted parameters), which should be solved in the LSA sense.

Usually the whole spectrum of eigenvalues is not available and therefore some parts

of the potential cannot be reliably retrieved from the experimental data.

In case of the

pointwise representation of the potential this means that the calculated term energies of the

experimentally observed levels are not sensitive to some of the uk. The inversion problem

becomes ill-conditioned then and its solution may be unstable to data perturbation and

lacking a physical sense, particularly in terms of a desired smoothness of the constructed

potential. The ill-conditioning of the problem does not imply that a meaningful approximate

solution cannot be found, but an extra care has to be taken to obtain a physically acceptable

result. The singular value decomposition (SVD) method [17] chosen by us for solving the

initial system of linear equations oﬀers a partial remedy. Also a sensible choice of a sparse

grid for the pointwise potential in the regions badly characterized by the experimental data

can ﬂatten to some extent the undesirable wiggles on it (see [22]). Here we propose a simpler,

more general and more eﬀective solution, based on an additional constraint imposed on the

constructed potential.

Generally, the usual way of obtaining a smooth ﬁtted function f (R, a) is to add to the
merit function χ2(a) a regularizing functional H(a) which is responsible for the smoothness

of the solution and to minimize the sum

minimize: χ2(a) + λ2H(a)

(6)

where λ is a parameter used to tune the degree of regularization. A possible form of H(a)

8

is (see e.g. [17], Chapter 18):

H(a) =

(f ′′(R, a))2dR

R2

Z

R1

Here, by minimizing the integral of the square of the second derivative, one sets the

additional condition that the ﬁtted function should be as close to a straight line as possible

between R1 and R2. Since in our version of the IPA method the ﬁtted potential is deﬁned

as a cubic spline function drawn between given grid points (Rk, uk), the second derivative
U ′′(R, u) between these points is a linear function of R. Therefore we deﬁne a somewhat

simpliﬁed form of the regularizing functional as

H(u) =

(U ′′(Rj, u))2

Xj

where U ′′(Rj, u) = U ′′

j denotes the second derivative of the potential in a grid point Rj.

Similarly to Eq. (3), in Ref. [6] it was shown that

U ′′

j =

Ljiui.

Xi
where Lji are known coeﬃcients. Therefore in the present case the regularization condition

is reduced to supplementing the system of linear equations (5) by a set of M equations:

λLji(u0

i + ∆ui) = 0

Xi

Here u0
i

is the initial value of the i-th ﬁtting parameter. Each equation requires that

the respective second derivative U ′′

j equals zero and the summation is performed over all

ﬁtted parameters. When λ = 0, the system (5) remains unchanged, i.e. no regularization is

imposed. Increasing λ results in ﬂattening of the potential in competition with the initial

condition deﬁned by (5). In principle the value of λ in (10) can depend on j, varying smoothly

from zero for the parts of the potential with abundant experimental data to some large value

for the regions badly characterized by the experiment; the other sensible possibility is to

make the change stepwise and this approach has been adopted in the present work.

V. POTENTIAL CURVE OF THE 41Σ+

u STATE

With the body of data described in Section III we applied the IPA technique to deter-

mine the potential energy curve of the 41Σ+

u state. Initially we limited our analysis to the

inner well of the molecular potential, containing a majority of levels observed in the present

experiment. Transitions to rovibrational levels located there formed clear vibrational pro-

gressions of spectral lines. However, we observed that distances between subsequent P, R

doublets did not decrease in a systematic way even for the ﬁrst few doublets in each pro-

gression, as expected for a well-behaved molecular potential. This observation supported

theoretical prediction of substantial deformation of the inner well. In consequence, levels

situated in the inner well could not be characterized by a set of molecular constants and a

standard RKR procedure could not be used for determination of the inner well. Under these

circumstances we rather applied a variant of the RKR method ﬁrst proposed by Stwalley

[2], which allows to construct an approximate potential energy curve from vibrational term

values G(v) and rotational constants Bv obtained directly from the experimental spectrum,

i.e. from a distance of the subsequent P, R doublets and the P-R combination diﬀerences

measured in a chosen progression, preferably being the longest one.

The potential curve generated in this way was used then as an approximate starting

potential for the standard IPA procedure [6] (i.e. without regularization).

It provided a

reﬁned potential energy curve which reproduced eigenenergies of levels distant from the top
of the potential barrier by more than 50 cm−1 (i.e. the levels, for which the presence of the

outer well could be neglected) within the experimental accuracy. In the second part of our

analysis we used a larger data set including levels close to and above the potential barrier. In

this case the existence of both potential wells has to be taken into account and accordingly

we extended the region of internuclear distances R, for which the potential was considered,
to R ≈ 16 ˚A. As a starting potential for the next run of the IPA routine we adopted a

hybrid potential consisting of the inner well from the previous step matched smoothly with

the theoretical curve calculated by Magnier [23] used to represent the outer well.

An equidistant grid was used for the approximate potential since Eqs. 3 and 9 are derived

under this condition. Although a generalization of both equations is possible also for a non-

equidistant grid, this would require signiﬁcant changes in the ﬁtting code [6]. Moreover, it

is not clear a priori how to ﬁnd the optimal distribution of the grid points. Hence initially

10

we deﬁned U0(R) in 110 equidistant points for 2.4 ˚A≤ R ≤ 15.9 ˚A, i.e. a grid dense enough

to describe the steepest changes of the potential curve.

After several iterations the r.m.s. deviation of the ﬁt decreased below 0.05 cm−1, that is

the generated IPA potential reproduced all the observed levels with an expected accuracy. At

closer inspection, however, the potential turned out unsatisfactory: the outer well displayed

unphysical irregularities in a form of ripples, resulting from scarcity of experimental data

deﬁning the region of large R values. Therefore we reﬁtted the potential including the

regularization condition in the form of Eq. 10. During the ﬁt λ was varied between 1.0 and
4.0 for R > Rreg and set to zero otherwise. Several values of Rreg between 6.5 and 8.0 ˚A

were tested. The value of λ was gradually increased to smooth the outer potential well, until

the quality of the ﬁt started to deteriorate. Once a satisfactory shape of the outer well was

achieved, we reduced the number of grid points as described in Ref. [6].

The ﬁnal version of the potential is presented in Table I and in Fig. 3. The last ﬁve

points were taken from theoretical calculations [23]. Their inﬂuence on the energy level

positions is negligible and they were added mainly to ensure proper boundary conditions

for solving the Schr¨odinger equation.

In order to calculate the value of the potential for

arbitrary R, a natural cubic spline should be used [17]. The potential reproduces 325 of
totally 332 observed energy levels with a standard deviation of 0.044 cm−1 and a normalized

standard deviation of 0.88. Seven levels were excluded from the ﬁt since the deviations
from the calculated term energies exceeded 0.15 cm−1. We attribute these discrepancies to

perturbations by the neighboring singlet or triplet states [23].

VI. FINAL REMARKS

In the present work we attempted to construct the highly irregular potential energy curve

of the 41Σ+

u state in Na2 from the experimental data abundant for levels in the inner potential

well but scarce for the region around and above the internal barrier. A version of the IPA

procedure involving the pointwise representation of the potential and its regularization was

used. The inner well has been determined accurately, however problems arose when trying to

ﬁnd the shape of the barrier and the outer potential well. A small number of the measured

level energies inﬂuencing these parts of the potential suggested that determination of its

shape was not possible.

potential curve could not provide a unique result. However, from many possible potentials,

representing positions of all the experimental levels equally well, we were able to select one

with a sensible physical shape. A general procedure, based on the mathematical concept

of regularization of the constructed potential curve, has been suggested to deal with such

problems. Still, it should be borne in mind that the outer well of the potential reported

in Table I is only a plausible smooth solution to the inversion problem and it would be

unreasonable to speculate about its accuracy. The only way to improve its reliability is to

collect more experimental data related to this part of the potential.

It should be also noted that the uncertainty of the outer potential well aﬀects the vibra-

tional numbering of the rovibrational levels of the 41Σ+

u state. Small changes of the outer

well may cause a change of the numbering of levels which wave functions are signiﬁcantly

nonzero mainly in the inner well. Of course this will change neither their term energies,

nor the relative vibrational numbering of the levels belonging to the inner well, i.e. the

quantities directly observable in the present experiment.

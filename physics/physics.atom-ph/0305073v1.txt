We have applied an optical method to the measurement of the 2S hyperﬁne interval in atomic
hydrogen. The interval has been measured by means of two-photon spectroscopy of the 1S −
2S transition on a hydrogen atomic beam shielded from external magnetic ﬁelds. The measured
value of the 2S hyperﬁne interval is equal to 177 556 860(15) Hz and represents the most precise
measurement of this interval to date. The theoretical evaluation of the speciﬁc combination of 1S
and 2S hyperﬁne intervals D21 is in moderately good agreement with the value for D21 deduced
from our measurement.

PACS numbers: 12.20.Fv, 32.10.Fn, 32.30.Jc, 42.62.Fi

The frequency of the 2S hyperﬁne interval fHFS(2S)
has been measured twice during the last 50 years by driv-
ing the magnetic-dipole radio-frequency transition in a
hydrogen thermal beam [1, 2]. The relative accuracy of
these measurements (150−300 ppb) exceeds the accuracy
of the theoretical prediction for the 2S hyperﬁne inter-
val which is restricted by an insuﬃcient knowledge of the
proton structure. However, the speciﬁc combination of
the 1S and 2S hyperﬁne intervals

D21 = 8fHFS(2S) − fHFS(1S)

(1)

can be calculated with high precision due to signiﬁcant
cancellations of nuclear structure eﬀects (see [3] and ref-
erences therein). As the 1S hyperﬁne splitting in hydro-
gen fHFS(1S), known experimentally to several parts in
1013 (see e.g. [4]), does not restrict the accuracy of (1),
it is possible to compare the experimentally measured 2S
hyperﬁne interval with fHFS(2S) deduced from the theo-
retical D21 value. The quantum-electrodynamics theory
(QED) for the state-dependent contribution to the nS
hyperﬁne splitting can thus be tested to the level up to
α4 and α3me/mp. This test is limited only by the exper-
imental uncertainty.

The recent theoretical value of Dtheor

is equal to
48 953(3) Hz and corresponds to a 2S hyperﬁne interval
of f theor
HFS (2S) = 177 556 838.1(4) Hz [3]. In 1956 Heberle,
Reich, and Kusch measured fHFS(2S) for the ﬁrst time
[1]. Their result was equal to 177 556 860(50) Hz which
is in an agreement with f theor
HFS (2S). In 2000 Rothery and
Hessels [2] improved the accuracy and obtained the value
of 177 556 785(29) Hz. We have performed a totally in-
dependent optical measurement of fHFS(2S). The result
of our measurement is 177 556 860(15) Hz which is up to
now the most precise value for the 2S hyperﬁne interval
in atomic hydrogen. Both recent results are in a mod-
erately good agreement (within 2σ) with the theoretical
value.

For the measurement of the 2S hyperﬁne interval in
atomic hydrogen we have applied 1S − 2S two-photon
spectroscopy to a cold hydrogen atomic beam which is
shielded from magnetic ﬁelds. Using a high-ﬁnesse cavity

as a frequency ﬂywheel we deduce the 2S hyperﬁne in-
terval as the frequency diﬀerence between two extremely
stable laser light ﬁelds which excite the respective tran-
sitions between the diﬀerent hyperﬁne sublevels of the
1S and 2S states in atomic hydrogen. The diﬀerential
measurement cancels some important systematic eﬀects
typical for two-photon spectroscopy on atomic beams.
Applying this optical method, we achieve a level of ac-
curacy which is nearly 2 times better than the accuracy
of the recent radio-frequency measurement [2]. Along
with the previous optical Lamb shift measurement [6],
our present measurement demonstrates the perspectives
of precision optical methods in ﬁelds where traditionally
radio-frequency techniques have been used.

The hydrogen spectrometer setup, described in detail
elsewhere [7], has been modiﬁed by magnetic compen-
sation and shielding systems and an optional diﬀerential
pumping system [8]. A dye laser operating near 486 nm is
locked to an ultra-stable reference cavity made from ULE
by means of the Pound-Drever-Hall lock. The drift of the
cavity, suspended in a vacuum chamber with a two-stage
active temperature stabilization system, is typically 0.5
Hz/s.

The frequency of the dye laser light is doubled in a
β-barium borate crystal, and the resulting UV radiation
near 243 nm is coupled into a linear enhancement cavity
inside a vacuum chamber. Atomic hydrogen, produced
in a radio-frequency discharge at a pressure of around
1 mbar, ﬂows through teﬂon tubes to a copper noz-
zle cooled to 5 K with a helium ﬂow-through cryostat.
Hydrogen atoms thermalize in inelastic collisions with
the cold walls of the nozzle. The atomic beam escapes
from the nozzle coaxially to the mode of the enhance-
ment cavity. On their way through the laser ﬁeld some
atoms are excited via Doppler-free two-photon absorp-
tion from the ground state to the metastable 2S state.
In the detection region, these atoms are quenched in a
small electric ﬁeld and emit Lyman-α photons which are
counted by a photomultiplier. Slow atoms are selected by
time resolved spectroscopy [7] so that the second-order
Doppler shift and the time-of-ﬂight broadening are re-

duced, yielding typical linewidths around 2 kHz at 121
nm both for the 1S(F = 0) → 2S(F = 0) (singlet) and
1S(F = 1) → 2S(F = 1) (triplet) transition lines.

A turbo pump evacuates the main volume of the vac-
uum system to 5×10−5 mbar. The excitation region, sep-
arated from the main volume by a non-magnetic metal
housing, is diﬀerentially pumped by a large cryopump.
Two small holes in the front and back walls of the hous-
ing allow the excitation light to enter and exit this high
vacuum zone and collimate the atomic beam. With hy-
drogen atoms escaping from the cold nozzle, the pressure
in the excitation region is typically 3×10−8 mbar. An
additional lockable opening in the housing allows to mea-
sure at a worse pressure of 1.5×10−7 mbar. By increasing
the temperature of the cryopump, it is also possible to
work at even higher pressures up to 5 × 10−6 mbar. All
parts adjacent to the hydrogen beam are covered with
graphite to reduce stray electric ﬁelds in the excitation
region which would quench the hydrogen 2S population
and shift the transition frequencies due to the DC Stark
eﬀect.

To reduce the magnetic ﬁeld along the excitation re-
gion we use a two-stage magnetic shielding setup together
with external compensation coils. We have measured the
residual ﬁeld inside the ﬁrst shielding stage made from
100 µm thin µ-metal foil which encloses the entire ex-
citation region, the detector, and the nozzle to be less
than 20 mG. Inside this shielding, 1 mm thick µ-metal
tubes located along the enhancement cavity axis cover
about 90% of the whole excitation path of the hydrogen
atoms. The evaluated averaged shielding factor of the
second shielding stage is more than 20.

An external magnetic ﬁeld shifts the magnetic sub-
levels of the hydrogen 1S1/2 and 2S1/2 states according
to the Breit-Rabi equation [9]. For two-photon processes,
allowed transitions obey the selection rules ∆F = 0 and
∆mF = 0.
In our experiment, we excite two-photon
transitions from diﬀerent magnetic sublevels of the hy-
drogen ground state to corresponding sublevels of the 2S
state. In small magnetic ﬁelds, when the triplet splitting
vanishes, the 2S hyperﬁne interval is given by

fHFS(2S) = fHFS(1S) + f (1, ±1 or 0) − f (0, 0),

(2)

where the symbol f (F, mF ) denotes the transition fre-
quency between sublevels with quantum numbers (n =
1, F, mF ) and (n = 2, F, mF ) at 121 nm. A magnetic ﬁeld

of a double-passed broadband AOM placed between the
laser and the cavity. The frequency shift correspond-
ing to 121 nm is 8 times higher in absolute value than
the frequency shift of the synthesizer driving the AOM.
The factor 8 arises due to the double-passed AOM, the
optical frequency doubling, and the two-photon excita-
tion of the hydrogen atoms. The intensity of the light

used to lock the laser to the reference cavity is stabilized.
All synthesizers providing the radio frequencies in our
experiment are locked to the 10 MHz signal of a com-
mercial HP5071A cesium frequency standard (speciﬁed
Allan standard deviation 5 × 10−12 within one second).
The standard introduces a negligible error to the mea-
sured value.

During 16 days of measurements we have recorded
about 2000 hydrogen spectra for the triplet and singlet
transitions. A single spectrum consists of about 30 data
points, each measured for 1 second. For our ﬁtting pro-
cedure we have chosen the spectra recorded at a delay
time of 810 µs (time between the blocking of the exci-
tation light and the start of photon counting), for which
the spectrum asymmetry is considerably reduced. A typ-
ical count rate for the triplet transition in its maximum
is 350, while the averaged ratio between triplet and sin-
glet count rates is 3.25 ± 0.03. We ascribe the deviance
of this value from 3 to diﬀerent recombination rates in
the nozzle for hydrogen atoms in the singlet and triplet
ground states.

One measurement run consists of 2 − 6 hydrogen spec-
tra recorded one after another within approximately 5
minutes. After each run, we change the frequency of the
laser light to excite the other transition. During a mea-
surement day, we have switched about 50 times between
the triplet and singlet transitions. The intensity of the
excitation light is monitored after the enhancement cav-
ity and has been kept as constant as possible during the
whole day of measurement.

As the laser is locked to the same mode of the cavity,
the cavity drift is the same for both singlet and triplet
transitions. To determine the drift, we have ﬁtted each
hydrogen spectrum with a Lorentzian function in the
time and frequency domains. A part of a day drift data
set is shown on Fig.1. To reduce the eﬀect of a nonlinear
cavity drift, the drift data are ﬁtted stepwise within the
short time periods (about 20 minutes each) covering 2
singlet and 2 triplet runs. During this time period the
drift can be well approximated linearly, and we have ﬁt-
ted the data by means of linear regression with the same
slope. The ﬁt procedure has been performed analyti-
cally delivering the slope (cavity drift), oﬀset frequency,
and corresponding errors. According to the hydrogen
level scheme and the measurement technique, the oﬀset
frequency is equal to [fHFS(1S) − fHFS(2S)] /8. From
this, the 2S hyperﬁne interval and the D21 diﬀerence
can be calculated using the precise experimental value
for fHFS(1S).

A numerical simulation of the two-photon excitation
process in the hydrogen beam shows that the maximum
of the excitation probability distribution for the delayed
atoms is shifted in space towards the ﬁrst half of the
excitation region where the residual magnetic ﬁelds are
the smallest. A conservative estimation of a shift arising
from the less shielded paths in the direct vicinity of the

nozzle and the detector gives a value of 0.5(0.5) Hz.

An external electric ﬁeld E mixes the 2S1/2 level with
the adjacent 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 levels, shifting its energy.
While in ﬁrst order perturbation theory the 1S level is
not shifted in a DC electrical ﬁeld, the 2S F = 0 and
F = 1 levels are shifted diﬀerently because of their dif-
ferent energy spacing from the 2P levels. According to
a calculation of the DC Stark shift with the hyperﬁne
structure taken into consideration, the shift of the 2S
hyperﬁne interval is equal to 1100 E2 Hz cm2/V2. The
stray electrical ﬁelds within the excitation region of our
setup are estimated to be below 30 mV/cm [7] corre-
sponding to a shift of −1 Hz.

The AC Stark shift of a two-photon transition scales
inversely to the energy diﬀerence between real levels (in
our case 1S and 2S levels) and virtual levels [10]. The
hyperﬁne intervals are on the order of one GHz, while
virtual energy levels are about 3/8 Ry away from both
1S and 2S levels. Therefore, the diﬀerential AC Stark
shift of the hyperﬁne components in the hydrogen atom is
about 10−6 of the AC Stark shift of the 1S−2S transition
frequency. The typical AC Stark shift of the 1S − 2S
transition in our experiment is on the level of 500 Hz,
corresponding to a negligible diﬀerential shift of the 2S
hyperﬁne interval assumed that the light intensity is kept
constant.

However, inevitable small ﬂuctuations of the 243 nm
light intensity cause diﬀerent AC Stark shifts of each hy-
drogen spectrum. We have corrected for the intensity
ﬂuctuations, using the experimental value of 2.6 Hz/mW
for the 1S − 2S AC Stark shift [5], which shifts the ﬁnal
value of the 2S interval by 2 Hz. Besides correction, we
have added a conservative 2 Hz error to the error budget,
which may arise from the evaluation of the light intensity
circulating in the enhancement cavity.

Due to the second-order Doppler eﬀect the measured
line shape of the two-photon transition is not symmetric,
and the line center is shifted. For both singlet and triplet

3

transitions, the excited atoms are from the same atomic
beam, and the same velocity class is selected by the pre-
cisely deﬁned delay time. Therefore, the second-order
Doppler eﬀect cancels for the diﬀerential measurement
of the 2S hyperﬁne interval. We have evaluated diﬀer-
ent velocity classes of hydrogen atoms corresponding to
diﬀerent delay times and observe essentially no eﬀect on
the evaluated 2S hyperﬁne interval. As an independent
test we have ﬁtted a theoretically simulated lineform for
the delay time of 810 µs with a Lorentzian function and
found that the possible error of the line center deﬁnition
is less than 2 Hz. This error is also added to the error
budget.

one day.

According to [13], the interaction cross section for
atomic hydrogen in the 2S state is diﬀerent for triplet
and singlet states, and the pressure shift of the 2S hy-
perﬁne interval is comparable to the pressure shift of the
2S triplet level. The previous 2S hyperﬁne interval mea-
surement [2] indicates for a pressure shift of −31(24)
MHz/mbar, which is of the same order of magnitude
as the pressure shift of the 1S(F = 1, mF = ±1) →
2S(F = 1, mF = ±1) transition in hydrogen which is
−8(2) MHz/mbar [11, 12].

We have performed four sets of measurements at dif-
ferent background gas pressures. The data are plotted on
Fig.2, each point representing an averaged result. Points
a, b, c have been measured with approximately the same
hydrogen ﬂow through the nozzle, whereas point d is the
result of a one day measurement with two times increased
hydrogen ﬂow. Within the available range of pressures,
we observe no clear systematic dependence of the 2S hy-
perﬁne interval frequency on the background gas pres-
sure. However, there is some scatter of the data. The
estimated 2S triplet shift due to background gas pres-
sure is −8(2) MHz/mbar. In the ﬁnal averaging of the
data points a, b and c, we correct for such a shift, but
add a conservative 10 Hz error to the error budget.

As mentioned above, we have measured for one day in
the diﬀerential pumping conﬁguration with the hydrogen
ﬂow increased 2 times (point d on Fig.2) to investigate
the eﬀect of a pressure shift in the hydrogen beam. Slow
atoms interact more frequently with the rest of the beam
than the atoms of average thermal velocity, therefore the
pressure shift should be diﬀerent for them. We have eval-
uated the 2S hyperﬁne intervals for all delay times and
ﬁnd some non-systematic diﬀerence on the level of 5 Hz.
Accounting for the worse statistics of this day of measure-
ment, we have added an error of 10 Hz for the possible
pressure shift in the hydrogen beam.

One of the main processes causing the data scattering
is a nonlinear drift of the laser frequency on the time
scale of 30 min. This process does not cancel in our
ﬁt procedure, and has to be averaged. During the 16
days of measurement the cavity drift can be considered
as random and we expect no systematic shift due to it.
Fig.3 represents the distribution of the 2S hyperﬁne in-
terval data without the data of point d. The distribution
is symmetrical and can be approximated with a Gauss
function of 140 Hz width. Statistical averaging yields a
value for fHFS(2S) of 177 556 860(3) Hz.

The eﬀects which contribute errors and shifts to the 2S
hyperﬁne interval in our measurement are summarized in

system on the 6 × 10−15 level. The error rivals the 20 Hz
error of the radio-frequency 2S hyperﬁne interval mea-
surement in deuterium [14], which can also be performed
optically.

Our current measurement along with other precision
experiments on the hyperﬁne structure of 1S and 2S lev-
els in hydrogen and 3He+ ion [15] oﬀers a test of QED
on level of accuracy comparable to tests on pure leptonic
atoms such a muonium and positronium [3].

Theories unifying gravity with other interactions suggest temporal and spatial variation of the
fundamental ”constants” in expanding Universe. The spatial variation can explain a ﬁne tuning of
the fundamental constants which allows humans (and any life) to appear. We appeared in the area
of the Universe where the values of the fundamental constants are consistent with our existence.

We present a review of recent works devoted to the variation of the ﬁne structure constant α, strong
interaction and fundamental masses. There are some hints for the variation in quasar absorption
spectra, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data.

A very promising method to search for the variation of the fundamental constants consists in
comparison of diﬀerent atomic clocks. Huge enhancement of the variation eﬀects happens in tran-
sition between accidentally degenerate atomic and molecular energy levels. A new idea is to build
a “nuclear” clock based on the ultraviolet transition between very low excited state and ground
state in Thorium nucleus. This may allow to improve sensitivity to the variation up to 10 orders of
magnitude!

Huge enhancement of the variation eﬀects is also possible in cold atomic and molecular collisions

near Feschbach resonance.

I.

INTRODUCTION

II. OPTICAL SPECTRA

The possible variation of the fundamental constants of
nature is currently a very popular research topic. The-
ories unifying gravity and other interactions suggest the
possibility of spatial and temporal variation of physical
“constants” in the Universe (see, e.g.
[1, 2]). Current
interest is high because in superstring theories – which
have additional dimensions compactiﬁed on tiny scales –
any variation of the size of the extra dimensions results
in changes in the 3-dimensional coupling constants. At
present no mechanism for keeping the spatial scale static
has been found (for example, our three “large” spatial
dimensions increase in size). Moreover, there exists a
mechanism for making all coupling constants and masses
of elementary particles both space and time dependent,
and inﬂuenced by local circumstances (see e.g. review
[2]). The variation of coupling constants can be non-
monotonic (for example, damped oscillations).

Recent observations have produced several hints for
the variation of the ﬁne structure constant, α = e2/¯hc,
strength constant of the strong interaction and masses
in Big Bang nucleosynthesis, quasar absorption spectra
and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data (see e.g.[3, 4, 5, 6])
. However, a majority of publications report only lim-
its on possible variations (see e.g.
reviews [2, 7]). A
very sensitive method to study the variation in a lab-
oratory consists of the comparison of diﬀerent optical
and microwave atomic clocks (see recent measurements
in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]). Huge enhancement of
the relative variation eﬀects can be obtained in tran-
sition between the almost degenerate levels in atoms
[15, 16, 17, 18], molecules [19] and nuclei [20].

A. Comparison of quasar absorption spectra with
laboratory spectra

To perform measurements of α variation by compar-
ison of cosmic and laboratory optical spectra we devel-
oped a new approach [15, 21] which improves the sensi-
tivity to a variation of α by more than an order of mag-
nitude. The relative value of any relativistic corrections
to atomic transition frequencies is proportional to α2.
These corrections can exceed the ﬁne structure interval
between the excited levels by an order of magnitude (for
example, an s-wave electron does not have the spin-orbit
splitting but it has the maximal relativistic correction to
energy). The relativistic corrections vary very strongly
from atom to atom and can have opposite signs in diﬀer-
ent transitions (for example, in s-p and d-p transitions).
Thus, any variation of α could be revealed by compar-
ing diﬀerent transitions in diﬀerent atoms in cosmic and
laboratory spectra.

This method provides an order of magnitude precision
gain compared to measurements of the ﬁne structure in-
terval. Relativistic many-body calculations are used to
reveal the dependence of atomic frequencies on α for a
range of atomic species observed in quasar absorption
spectra [15, 16, 21, 22]. It is convenient to present re-
sults for the transition frequencies as functions of α2 in
the form

ω = ω0 + qx,

(1)

α0 )2 − 1 ≈ 2δα

where x = ( α
α and ω0 is a laboratory fre-
quency of a particular transition. We stress that the
second term contributes only if α deviates from the lab-
oratory value α0. We performed accurate many-body
calculations of the coeﬃcients q for all transtions of astro-

physical interest (strong E1 transtions from the ground
state) in Mg, Mg II, Fe II, Cr II, Ni II, Al II, Al III, Si II,
and Zn II. It is very important that this set of transtions
contains three large classes : positive shifters (large pos-
itive coeﬃcients q > 1000 cm−1), negative shifters (large
negative coeﬃcients q < −1000 cm−1) and anchor lines
with small values of q. This gives us an excellent con-
trol of systematic errors since systematic eﬀects do not
“know” about sign and magnitude of q. Comparison of
cosmic frequencies ω and laboratory frequencies ω0 al-
lows us to measure δα
α .

Three independent samples of data contaning 143 ab-
sorption systems spread over red shift range 0.2 < z <
α = (−0.543±0.116)×
4.2. The ﬁt of the data gives [3] is δα
10−5. If one assumes the linear dependence of α on time,
the ﬁt of the data gives d ln α/dt = (6.40 ± 1.35) × 10−16
per year (over time interval about 12 billion years). A
very extensive search for possible systematic errors has
shown that known systematic eﬀects can not explain the
result (It is still not completely excluded that the eﬀect
may be imitated by a large change of abundances of iso-
topes during last 10 billion years. We have checked that
diﬀerent isotopic abundances for any single element can
not imitate the observed eﬀect. It may be an improbable
“conspiracy” of several elements).

Recently our method and calculations [15, 16, 21, 22]
were used by two other groups [23]. However, they have
not detected any variation of α. Most probably, the
diﬀerence is explained by some undiscovered systematic
eﬀects. However, another explanation is not excluded.
These results of [3] are based on the data from the Keck
telescope which is located in the Northen hemisphere
(Hawaii). The results of [23] are based on the data from
the diﬀerent telescope (VLT) located in the Southern
hemisphere (Chile). Therefore, the diﬀerence in the re-
sults may be explained by the spatial variation of α.

Using opportunity I would like to ask for new, more
accurate laboratory measurements of UV transition fre-
quencies which have been observed in the quasar absorp-
tion spectra. The “shopping list” is presented in [24]. We
also need the laboratory measurements of isotopic shifts
- see [24]. We have performed very complicated calcula-
tions of these isotopic shifts [25]. However, the accuracy
of these calculations in atoms and ions with open d-shell
(like Fe II, Ni II, Cr II, Mn II, Ti II) may be very low.
The measurements for at list few lines are needed to test
these calculations. These measurements would be very
important for a study of evolution of isotope abundances
in the Universe, to exclude the systematic eﬀects in the
search for α variation and to test models of nuclear reac-
tions in stars and supernovi.

B. Optical cloks

Optical clocks also include transitions which have pos-
itive, negative or small constributions of the relativistic
corrections to frequencies. We used the same methods of

2

the relativistic many-body calculations to calculate the
dependence on α [15, 16, 26]. The coeﬃcients q for op-
tical clock transitions may be substantially larger than
in cosmic transitions since the clock transitions are often
in heavy atoms (Hg II, Yb II, Yb III, etc.) while cosmic
spectra contain mostly light atoms lines (Z < 33). The
relativistic eﬀects are proporitional to Z 2α2.

III. ENHANCED EFFECTS OF α VARIATION
IN ATOMS

An enhancement of the relative eﬀect of α variation can
be obtained in transition between the almost degenerate
levels in Dy atom [15, 16]. These levels move in oppo-
site directions if α varies. The relative variation may be
presented as δω/ω = Kδα/α where the coeﬃcient K ex-
ceeds 108. Speciﬁc values of K = 2q/ω are diﬀerent for
diﬀerent hyperﬁne components and isotopes which have
diﬀerent ω; q = 30, 000 cm−1, ω ∼ 10−4 cm−1. An exper-
iment is currently underway to place limits on α variation
using this transition [18]. Unfortunately, one of the levels
has quite a large linewidth and this limits the accuracy.
Several enhanced eﬀects of α variation in atoms have

been calculated in [17].

IV. ENHANCED EFFECTS OF α VARIATION
IN MOLECULES

The relative eﬀect of α variation in microwave transi-
tions between very close and narrow rotational-hyperﬁne
levels may be enhanced 2-3 orders of magnitude in di-
atomic molecules with unpaired electrons like LaS, LaO,
LuS, LuO, YbF and similar molecular ions [19]. The
enhancement is a result of cancellation between the hy-
perﬁne and rotational intervals; δω/ω = Kδα/α where
the coeﬃcients K are between 10 and 1000.

V. VARIATION OF THE STRONG
INTERACTION

The hypothetical uniﬁcation of all interactions implies
that a variation in α should be accompanied by a vari-
ation of the strong interaction strength and the funda-
mental masses. For example, the grand uniﬁcation model
[1] predicts the quantum chromody-
discussed in Ref.
namics (QCD) scale ΛQCD (deﬁned as the position of the
Landau pole in the logarithm for the running strong cou-
pling constant, αs(r) ∼ 1/ ln (ΛQCDr/¯hc)) is modiﬁed
as δΛQCD/ΛQCD ≈ 34 δα/α. The variations of quark
mass mq and electron masses me ( related to variation
of the Higgs vaccuum ﬁeld which generates fundamental
masses) in this model are given by δm/m ∼ 70 δα/α,
giving an estimate of the variation for the dimensionless

ratio

δ(m/ΛQCD)
(m/ΛQCD)

∼ 35

δα
α

(2)

The coeﬃcient here is model dependent but large val-
ues are generic for grand uniﬁcation models in which
modiﬁcations come from high energy scales; they appear
because the running strong-coupling constant and Higgs
constants (related to mass) run faster than α. If these
models are correct, the variation in electron or quark
masses and the strong interaction scale may be easier
to detect than a variation in α. One can only measure
the variation of dimensionless quantities. The variation
of mq/ΛQCD can be extracted from consideration of Big
Band nucleosynthesis, quasar absorption spectra and the
Oklo natural nuclear reactor, which was active about 1.8
billion years ago [27]. There are some hints for the varia-
tion in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (∼ 10−3 [4]) and Oklo
(∼ 10−9 [5]) data. The results for the variation have
small statistical errors (4 standard deviations from zero
for BBN and 11 standard deviations for Oklo). However,
it may be hard to prove that there are no other explana-
tions for the deviations since both phenomena are very
complicated.

The proton mass is proportional to ΛQCD (Mp ∼
3ΛQCD), therefore, the measurements of the variation of
the electron-to-proton mass ratio µ = me/Mp is equiv-
alent to the measurements of the variation of Xe =
me/ΛQCD. Two new results have been obtained re-
cently using quasar absorption spectra.
In our paper
[28] the varition of the ratio of the hydrogen hyper-
ﬁne frequency to optical frequencies in ions have been
measured. The result is consistent with no variation of
Xe = me/ΛQCD. However, in the most recent paper [6]
the variation was detected at the level of 4 standard de-
µ = (−2.4 ± 0.6) × 10−5. This result is
viations: δXe
based on the hydrogen molecule spectra. Note, however,
that the diﬀerence between the zero result of [28] and
non-zero result of [6] may be explained by a space-time
variation of Xe. The variation of Xe in [6] is substantially
larger than the variation of α measured in [3, 23]. This
may be considered as an argument in favour of Grand
Uniﬁcation theories of the variation [1].

Xe = δµ

ﬁne transitions in 133Cs, 87Rb, 171Yb+, 199Hg+, 111Cd,
129Xe, 139La, 1H, 2H and 3He. The results for the de-
pendence of the transition frequencies on variation of α,
Xe = me/ΛQCD and Xq = mq/ΛQCD are presented in
Ref.[30] (see the ﬁnal results in the Table IV of Ref.[30]).
Also, one can ﬁnd there experimental limits on these vari-
ations which follow from the recent measurements. The
accuracy is approaching 10−15 per year. This may be
compared to the sensitivity ∼ 10−5 − 10−6 per 1010 years
obtained using the quasar absorption spectra.

VII. ENHANCED EFFECT OF VARIATION OF
α AND STRONG INTERACTION IN UV
TRANSITION OF 229TH NUCLEUS (NUCLEAR
CLOCK)

A very narrow level (3.5±1) eV above the ground state
exists in 229Th nucleus [31] (in [32] the energy is (5.5 ±
1) eV ). The position of this level was determined from
the energy diﬀerences of many high-energy γ-transitions
(between 25 and 320 KeV) to the ground and excited
states. The subtraction produces the large uncertainty in
the position of the 3.5 eV excited state. The width of this
level is estimated to be about 10−4 Hz [33]. This would
explain why it is so hard to ﬁnd the direct radiation in
this very weak transition. The direct measurements have
only given experimental limits on the width and energy
of this transition (see e.g. [34]). A detailed discussion of
the measurements (including several unconﬁrmed claims
of the detection of the direct radiation ) is presented in
Ref.[33]. However, the search for the direct radiation
continues [35].

The 229Th transition is very narrow and can be in-
vestigated with laser spectroscopy. This makes 229Th a
possible reference for an optical clock of very high accu-
racy, and opens a new possibility for a laboratory search
for the varitation of the fundamental constants [36].

As it is shown in Ref. [20] there is an additional very
important advantage. The relative eﬀects of variation of
α and mq/ΛQCD are enhanced by 5-6 orders of magni-
tude. The estimate for the relative variation of the 229Th
transition frequency is

Karshenboim [29] has pointed out that measurements
of ratios of hyperﬁne structure intervals in diﬀerent atoms
are sensitive to variations in nuclear magnetic moments.
However, the magnetic moments are not the fundamen-
tal parameters and can not be directly compared with
any theory of the variations. Atomic and nuclear cal-
culations are needed for the interpretation of the mea-
surements. We have performed both atomic calculations
of α dependence [15, 16, 26] and nuclear calculations of
Xq = mq/ΛQCD dependence [30] for all microwave tran-
sitions of current experimental interest including hyper-

where Xq = mq/ΛQCD, Xs = ms/ΛQCD, mq = (mu +
md)/2 and ms is the strange quark mass. Therefore, the
Th experiment would have the potential of improving
the sensitivity to temporal variation of the fundamental
constants by many orders of magnitude.

Note that there are other narrow low-energy levels in
nuclei, e.g. 76 eV level in 235U with the 26.6 minutes
lifetime (see e.g.[36]). One may expect a similar en-
hancement there. Unfortunetely, this level can not be
reached with usual lasers. In principle, it may be investi-
gated using a free-electron laser or synchrotron radiation.

where K is the enhancement factor. For example, for Cs-
Cs collisions we obtained K ∼ 400. With the Feshbach
resonance, however, one is given the ﬂexibility to adjust
position of the resonance using external ﬁelds. Near a
narrow magnetic or an optical Feshbach resonance the
enhancement factor K may be increased by many orders
of magnitude.

However, the accuracy of the frequency measurements is
much lower in this case.

FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS IN ULTRACOLD
ATOM AND MOLECULE SYSTEMS NEAR
FESHBACH RESONANCES

Scattering length A, which can be measured in Bose-
Einstein condensate and Feshbach molecule experiments,
is extremely sensitive to the variation of the electron-to-
proton mass ratio µ = me/mp or Xe = me/ΛQCD [37].

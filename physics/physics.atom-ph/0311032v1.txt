Abstract The generation of harmonics by atoms in-
teracting with two circularly polarized and frequency re-
lated laser ﬁelds is addressed through ab initio numerical
simulations. A detailed charaterization of a few speciﬁc
harmonics is given. In particular, the two diﬀerent cases
where the total energy absorbed through photons is far-
oﬀ or close to the energy gap between diﬀerent atomic
states are investigated. It is found that the conversion
eﬃciency in the harmonic generation is strongly depen-
dent on the inner atomic structure and in certain speciﬁc
cases it can be signiﬁcantly enhanced within a small fre-
quency range.

higher is η the less is the number of harmonics in a cer-
tain frequency range, and the circular polarization of the
emitted harmonics. This last point becomes particular
appealing for harmonics in the soft X-ray regime. Har-
monic generation from sources other than atoms and cir-
cular molecules, like linear molecules [5], nanotubes [6],
and plasmas [7] have been also investigated. The present
paper is organized as follows: after a short summary of
the theoretical frame within which our system lies, a
full description of the model and of the numerical sim-
ulations performed is presented. Finally, a conclusion is
given. Atomic units (a.u.) are used throughout all the
paper.

Introduction

Theoretical frame

The interaction between an atom and two coplanar laser
ﬁelds with circular polarization and commensurate fre-
quencies is certainly an intriguing topic. In fact, it is
worth to recall that when a single circularly polarized
laser interacts with an atom no harmonic generation is
possible.
In the case where the two laser ﬁelds have opposite po-
larization the emitted harmonics are of order

n = k(η + 1) ± 1,

(1)

where η is the frequency ratio and k ∈ N+. Selection
rules of this type are characteristic of all systems whose
Hamiltonian is invariant under a dynamical symmetry
operation[1], i.e., a transformation in both space and
time. A further example of such systems is a circular
molecule, e.g. benzene, interacting with a single circu-
larly polarized laser ﬁeld[1,2,3,4]. The derivation of such
selection rules can be achieved by means of diﬀerent ar-
guments: angular momentum conservation, group the-
ory and change of reference frame[4]. The conﬁguration
we investigate here is of particular interest because of
the ﬁltering eﬀect due to the selection rules (1), i.e., the

In order to fully understand the nature of the hamon-
ics we investigate, let us ﬁrstly summarize the deriva-
tion of the selection rules (1) using angular momen-
tum conservation. Let z be the propagation direction
of the two lasers and σ+, σ− the polarizations of the
laser of frequency ω and η ω, respectively. If a harmonic
σ+ is emitted the sum of all the components along z of
the angular momentum carried by the absorbed photons
has to be +1. If the atom for example absorbs p pho-
tons from the low-frequency laser, it must absorb p − 1
from the other laser. Hence, the total absorbed energy is
pω + (p − 1)ηω = ω[p(1 + η) − η] = ω[(p − 1)(1 + η) + 1].
Since p is arbitrary, with k = p + 1 and N = η + 1
we see that the harmonic of order (kN + 1) is emitted.
With the same argument, starting from a harmonic of
polarization σ−, we obtain kN − 1. The key point that
should be stressed is the following: harmonic generation
is possible if, and only if, the absorption of p photons
from one laser is accompanied by the absorption of p ± 1
photons from the other laser.
Angular momentum considerations, as well as symmetry
invariances, provide informations on the allowed orders,

but they cannot be used to derive any details concerning
relative intensities and structures in the harmonic spec-
tra like plateaus and cut-oﬀs. Above all, stating that a
certain order is allowed does not mean that the corre-
sponding harmonic is really emitted. In fact, the previous
arguments do not include case-speciﬁc features such as
the atomic structure and the laser intensities.
Recently, the characteristics and the ﬁeld dependence of
the harmonics emitted in our conﬁguration have been
addressed analytically through a calculation[8] based on
the Lewenstein model[9]. With this analytical tool it is
possible to derive a generalized cut-oﬀ for the harmonic
spectra, an integral expression for the harmonic dipole
strength, and to obtain again, independently, the selec-
tion rules (1). For what concerns the harmonic intensi-
ties such a model treatment holds as long as the total
absorbed energy by the electron is not “too close” to
a transition[8]. In case the absorbed energy is far from
any resonance diﬀerent predictions obtained from the
analytical model are conﬁrmed through the numerical
simulations. In particular it was found that if E1 and
E2 are the electric ﬁelds of the low- and high-frequency
laser, the intensity of the two harmonics with the same
k are very diﬀerent when E1 ≪ E2, and they converge
for E1 ≫ E2.

Numerical simulations

The numerical simulations were performed through an
ab initio integration of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation on a two-dimensional (2D) grid. Choosing a 2D
grid permits to run simulations quickly on every modern
PC and is not expected to introduce qualitative modiﬁ-
cations to the phenomena we aim to investigate. In par-
ticular, this holds for the speciﬁc conﬁguration we are
addressing here. In fact, both the electric ﬁeld vectors of
the lasers as well as the electron’s trajectories lie in the
plane that is represented by the 2D numerical grid. In the
direction perpendicular to that plane the electron wave
packet merely spreads. This spreading is not expected to
strongly aﬀect the main features of the harmonic gener-
ation spectra such as the cut-oﬀ, for instance. Using a
polar grid rather than a Cartesian one ensures that no
artiﬁcial symmetry violation due to the numerics is in-
troduced.
In polar coordinates (ρ, ϕ), dipole approximation, and
length gauge the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

with two circularly polarized laser ﬁelds. The electric ﬁeld

The parameters α and β can be tuned in order to ad-
just the ionization energy. In our simulations we used
α = 2.44 and β = 0.20. These values provide an ioniza-
tion potential of Ip = 2.0, i.e., the one of real He+. As
we aim to address the role played by resonances in the
conversion eﬃciency it is important to know the level
scheme of the model potential we use. With the chosen
parameters the lowest four excited states have energies
Ω1 = 0.985, Ω2 = 1.375, Ω3 = 1.548, and Ω4 = 1.592.
These energies are measured with respect to the ground
state. The laser frequencies have been chosen in accor-
dance to this levels scheme. Concerning the frequency
ratio η all the results presented hereafter have been ob-
tained taking η = 4. In Fig. 1 an example of a two-color
spectrum obtained with laser ﬁelds of equal intensities is
shown. As expected only orders allowed by the selection
rules are present. Substructures and broadening of cer-
tain harmonics can be present when bound states other
than the ground state come into play[4].
The laser frequency ω has to be chosen carefully. In fact,
on one hand we want the lower harmonics not to be af-
fected by the atomic levels, on the other hand we want
to approach resonances for the higher harmonics. The
total absorbed energy which leads to harmonic genera-
tion is ωN ∗ with N ∗ = k +η(k ±1). Obviously N ∗ is also
the order of the emitted harmonic. Therefore choosing
ω = Ωi/N ∗ provides the “virtual” resonance, i.e., the
N ∗-th harmonic is resonant with the transition between
the ground state and the i-th excited state. This is a par-

ticular kind of resonance, in fact none of the two absorp-
tion processes is directly resonant, but their combination
is. The ionization rate is nearly not aﬀected by the close-
ness of such kind of resonances and remains always very
low. Choosing N ∗ = 11 and i = 1 the expected resonant
frequency is ω = 0.0285π. A scheme of such a conﬁgura-
tion is presented in Fig. 2. While the harmonic no. 11 is
exactly resonant with the ﬁrst excited state, harmonics
no. 6 and no. 9 are not aﬀected by any energy level. Once
the frequency value was ﬁxed, a series of simulations for
diﬀerent laser ﬁelds intensities have been performed. As
we deal with two diﬀerent absorption processes, in or-
der to obtain eﬃcient harmonic generation it is neces-
sary that the two separate processes are “likely”,i.e., the
probabilties of absorbing the required numbers of pho-

tons from each of the two laser must be of the same order
of magnitude.

In Fig. 3 the behavior of the harmonic no. 6 versus
the electric ﬁeld E1 for diﬀerent values of E2 is plot-
ted. As expected the intensity of the harmonic increases
smoothly with increasing laser intensity. A very diﬀer-
ent behavior is observed for the harmonic no. 11 (Fig. 4).
For relatively low intensities of E1 the behavior is simi-
lar to that of the harmonic no. 6, but when the electric
ﬁeld E1 becomes stronger a much more complex behav-
ior appears. This is clearly due to the resonance with the
ﬁrst excited state. Actually, the frequency ω = Ω1/11 is
close to resonance, but not exactly resonant. In fact, one
should take into account the level shifts due to the dy-
namical Stark eﬀect: all levels are expected to be moved
upward. Giving an analytical estimation on how much
the lower lying excited states are moved up is a very dif-
ﬁcult task already when only a single, linearly polarized
laser ﬁeld is taken into account, let alone in our two-color
conﬁguration. In particular it is diﬃcult to distinguish
between the diﬀerent contributions of the two laser ﬁelds.

Fig. 5 Dipole strength of harmonic no. 11 vs E1 for diﬀer-
ent laser frequencies. E2 = 0.13 is held constant. A small
increase (or decrease) of the laser frequency aﬀects strongly
the eﬃciency conversion of the harmonic which approaches
the resonance.

A possible method for studying how a full resonance af-
fects the harmonic generation is to perform a series of
numerical simulations where all parameters but the laser
frequency ω is kept constant. Increasing the energy of
the photons compensates the shift due to the Stark ef-
fect and allows to reach the shifted excited state again
with 11 photons. As the amount of the shift is unkwown
diﬀerent values of ω have been used. The results of these
simulations are presented in Fig. 5. It appears that the
harmonic intensity strongly depends on the exact value
of the laser frequency, i.e., a small increase or decrease
in the frequency value can change the harmonic inten-
sity several orders of magnitude. From Fig. 5 one real-
izes that the full resonance is achieved for ω = 0.030π
and E1 = 0.07, leading to an energy shift which is about
0.052 a.u. All these values are obtained keeping constant
E2 = 0.13. If the value of E2 is diﬀerent the previous
values for ω and E1 do not hold anymore although the
physics remains qualitatively the same. In order to bet-
ter estimate the dependence of the conversion eﬃciency
with respect to the exact location of the excited state
a diﬀerent kind of study has been carried out. Taking
the laser intensities which in Fig. 5 give the maximum
harmonic intensity, namely E1 = 0.07 and E2 = 0.13, a
series of simulations for diﬀerent laser frequencies within
a small frequency range has been performed. The results
of such study are presented in Fig. 6. While the inten-
sity of harmonic no. 9 varies slowly, the intensity of har-
monic no. 11 exhibits a strong enhancement due to the
resonance. The ionization level remains negligible for all
frequencies values presented in Fig. 6.

Conclusions

In this work an extensive numerical study of harmonic
generation in the two-color coplanar conﬁguration has
been presented. In particular the cases of far-oﬀ and near
resonances absorption have been addressed. It has been
shown that the atomic levels can be used as an important
tool in order to enhance signiﬁcantly the intensity of
a particular harmonic without increasing the ionization
rate.

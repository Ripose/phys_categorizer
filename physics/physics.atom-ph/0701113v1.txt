In a recent experiment (N. Wagner et al.

[1]) on SF6, a high-harmonic generating laser pulse
is preceded by a pump pulse which stimulates Raman-active modes in the molecule. Varying the
time delay between the two pulses modulates high harmonic intensity, with frequencies equal to the
vibration frequencies of the Raman-active modes. We propose an explanation of this modulation as
a quantum interference between competing pathways that occur via adjacent vibrational states of
the molecule. The Raman and high harmonic processes act as beamsplitters, producing vibrational
quantum beats among the Raman-active vibrational modes that are excited by the ﬁrst pulse. We
introduce a rigorous treatment of the electron-ion recombination process and the eﬀect of the ionic
Coulomb ﬁeld in the electron propagation outside the molecule, improving over the widely-used
three-step model.

High harmonic generation (HHG) is commonly under-
stood as a 3 step process [2] in which an electron ion-
izes from a molecule, propagates in a strong laser ﬁeld,
and then recombines with the parent ion while emitting a
photon. Acceleration by the laser ﬁeld allows the electron
to return with a large kinetic energy and emit photons
with energy much higher than those of the driving laser.

W/cm2 HHG laser pulse was preceded by a weaker 25 fs,
1013W/cm2 pulse which excited Raman-active vibra-

tions in the molecule. The intensity of the high harmonic
light was found to oscillate with the interpulse delay time
at the excited molecular vibration frequencies. The sur-
prising result was that the breathing mode, overwhelm-
ingly dominant in conventional Raman experiments with
this molecule, is no longer the strongest mode seen in the
HHG experiment.

In this Letter, we interpret these oscillations as an in-
terference between indistinguishable quantum pathways
associated with diﬀerent intermediate vibrational states
during the HHG process, illustrated in Fig. 1. We de-
velop a quantum mechanical description of the recent
pump-probe SF6 experiments, using a framework that
substantially improves on the three-step model.[2] We
have included the eﬀects of the ion’s Coulomb potential
on the propagating electron, and utilized a nonpertur-
bative electron-molecule scattering wavefunction [3] to
calculate the recombination amplitude. The resulting
calculation exhibits partial agreement with experimental
observations.

We adopt a level of approximation in which all op-
erators depending on the nuclear coordinates are ex-
panded to ﬁrst order in the normal mode coordinates

The evolution of the ionic vibrational/electronic wave-
function between ionization and recombination is in gen-
eral quite complicated, since the three degenerate orbitals
of SF+
6 , which have T1g symmetry, are coupled by vi-
brational degrees of freedom [6, 7, 8]. The linear and
quadratic terms in the Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian [6, 7, 8],
which governs the coupled vibrational/electronic evolu-
tion, are found for each Qi by ﬁtting the eigenvalues of
the coupling matrix to the lowest 3 adiabatic energies
of SF+
6 for diﬀerent displacements of the ion away from
the maximum symmetry conﬁguration. The energies are
found using Gaussian’s CASSCF method and a cc-PVDZ
basis set[4]. In the notation of [6], VT2g =.001209 H/bohr,
VEg =.1420 H/bohr, N1=-.0362 H/bohr2, KT2g =.7288
H/bohr2, KEg =1.8486 H/bohr2. For the A1g mode,
which does not enter into the vibronic Hamiltonian, an
adiabatic potential E = VA1g QA1g + 1/2KA1gQ2
A1g , with
VA1g =.0645 H/bohr, KA1g =2.98 H/bohr2 gives the po-
tential energy surface for all three electronic states. An
important simpliﬁcation is that the oﬀ-diagonal coupling
between diﬀerent electronic states, proportional to VT , is
small and can be neglected for the short times between
ionization and recombination.

Neglecting oﬀ-diagonal coupling between electronic
states, the adiabatic potential felt by the ion in a par-

At this level of approximation, calculating ˆI and

This framework is applied to real molecules, using an
improved version of the 3 step model. For the ionization
step, a simple one-dimensional WKB tunneling picture
describes an electron tunneling only in directions parallel
to the laser electric ﬁeld. This is motivated by the “ini-
tial value representation” [9, 10]. In the classically for-
bidden region under the barrier formed by the molecular
potential and the laser ﬁeld, the tunneling wavefunction
equals the value of the unperturbed molecular HOMO at
the inner turning point times a declining WKB exponen-
ˆz, the
tial. With the direction of the electric ﬁeld as

electric ﬁeld.

After tunneling, the free electron wavefunction’s evo-
lution is relatively simple until it rescatters from the par-
ent ion. ψc(r, Ω, t), the continuum wavefunction at the
instant just prior to the electron rescattering from the
molecular ion, is found using Gutzwiller’s semiclassical

When the electron recollides with the parent ion, its
wavefunction is distorted strongly by the molecular po-
tential and by exchange eﬀects with the other electrons,
which can dramatically change amplitudes for recombi-
nation with respect to the plane wave approximation.
Techniques described in Refs [3, 12, 13] determine a com-
plete set of stationary ﬁeld-free electron-molecule scatter-
ing states. Beyond the range of the molecular potential,
the scattering states are given in terms of incoming and

For a chosen time of projection onto the scatter-
ing states, Eqs.
(6) and (8) together deﬁne a seven-
dimensional integral over initial and ﬁnal positions and
initial times. However, the integrand oscillates rapidly
almost everywhere, causing cancellations.
Stationary
phase techniques identify the region where the integrand
oscillates slowly, which permits evaluation.

The semiclassical action S is expanded to second or-
der around the starting and ending points of some clas-
sical trajectory, and about the starting time. Near
the starting position and time, ψt(~r0 + δ~r0, t0 + δt0) =

The integrand oscillates most slowly when its complex
phase is nearly constant. This happens when the linear
terms in the S expansion are canceled by the linear terms
in the complex phases of the initial and ﬁnal states. For
such a trajectory, the contributions of nearby trajectories
with nearly the same ~x0, t0, ~x, t to the integral will tend
to add constructively. These “stationary phase” trajec-
tories are not the only trajectories of interest in the prob-
lem, but expanding S about their beginning and ending

3

points describes the phase in the slowly-varying region of
interest.

These stationary phase conditions are met by a tra-
jectory that begins “downstream” of the molecule in the
direction of the electric ﬁeld with zero momentum, moves
only radially and parallel to the electric ﬁeld until it
reencounters the parent molecule at the scattering state
energy. Only the incoming-wave part of the scattering
states gives a nonvanishing contribution to the expansion
coeﬃcients. Performing the resulting gaussian integrals
about the initial and ﬁnal points, and about the initial
time, yields expansion coeﬃcients

the recombination amplitude calculated for each individ-

ual scattering state. This connects to the quantum paths
framework when I = ψt(~r0, t0), and ~R= ~D(E) calculated
for I = 1. Both quantities are calculated at the equilib-
rium geometry, then for a geometry distorted by 0.1 bohr
ˆ~R and their de-
in the normal mode coordinate to ﬁnd ˆI,
rivitives. This involves recalculating the scattering states
and recombination dipoles for the distorted geometry.

The modulation of the 39th harmonic, which the JILA
experiment considered in detail, is calculated for com-
parison with experiment. This harmonic is close to the
measured cutoﬀ, so it can only be produced by a laser
half-cycle where the maximum of the electric ﬁeld falls
close to the maximum of the Gaussian envelope. Accord-
ingly, only the modulation for a single half-cycle where
these two maxima coincide was used. In the expression
for the harmonic intensity at some harmonic order, Eq.
(3), all the quantities depend on molecular orientation. A
rotational average of P0 and P1 were calculated, since the
JILA experiment was performed on a gas jet of molecules
which had no preferred orientation. Only polarizations
perpendicular to the propagating beam were included in
these averages. Although each of the T2g and Eg modes
modulates the harmonic intensity strongly at particular
orientations, the phase oﬀset δ in P1cos(ωτ + δ) changes
with orientation, cancelling some of the observed oscil-
lation. The more symmetric Ag mode experiences less
cancellation because the initial Raman pulse stimulates
it equally for all molecular orientations. The trends in
the peak intensities of diﬀerent normal modes are, how-
ever, similar with and without the phase. Fig. 2 com-
pares the spherically averaged peak-to-peak modulation
with phase information included, with phase information

excluded by setting δ = 0 for all orientations, and the
experimentally measured modulations for each mode for
the two runs for which all three mode modulations could
be distinguished from the background [14]. It should be
noted that although the relative peak intensities are not
in agreement with experiment, the intensities for the dif-
ferent peaks are all the same order of magnitude, whereas
in the Raman spectrum the Ag mode is 20 times more
intense than the others. [1]

Since the scattering wavefunction is expanded in ﬁeld-
free scattering states, the calculated modulation varies
slightly depending on the time at which the semiclassi-
cal wavefunction is projected onto the scattering states.
Additional uncertainty may arise because of the various
approximations made in the treatment of molecular scat-
tering, detailed in [3, 12, 13]. Fig. 2 shows modulations
calculated when this projection is made at ωt = 3.9 ra-
dians, when the short electron trajectories return to the
vicinity of the parent molecule with the correct energy to
yield 39th harmonic photons upon recombination.

In the present work, we have combined for the ﬁrst
time a rigorous treatment of electron-molecule scattering
with a semiclassical description of electronic propagation,
resulting in a ﬂexible and robust implementation that
has been used to treat a complex molecule with many
internal degrees of freedom to a level of sophistication
that is unprecedented in this area of research for such a
large system. We have shown how the internal degrees of
freedom allow for phenomena which have no analogue in
atomic systems, demonstrating that the HHG signal can
be modulated interferometrically by a molecule’s vibra-
tional state. Thus HHG could serve both as an interfero-
metric probe of chemical dynamics (similar to the way in
which rearrangement dynamics are investigated in Ref.
[15]) and as a complementary tool to traditional spec-
troscopic techniques, oﬀering great potential for future
investigations.

Abstract

Adiabatic dressed state potentials are created when magnetic sub-states of trapped atoms are

coupled by a radio frequency ﬁeld. We discuss their theoretical foundations and point out fun-

damental advantages over potentials purely based on static ﬁelds. We show that the enhanced

ﬂexibility allows to implement numerous novel conﬁgurations, including double wells and Mach-

Zehnder and Sagnac interferometers. Their realization, utilizing simple and highly integrated wire

geometries, is presented.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic ﬁelds are powerful tools to control and manipulate the motion of neutral atoms

[1, 2]. These ﬁelds can be created by (macroscopic) coils [3], free standing wires [4, 5, 6] or

- as a result of the growing eﬀort for miniaturization and integration - by surface-mounted

micro fabricated structures, so-called atom chips [7]. Compared to macroscopic setups, atom

chips provide high magnetic ﬁeld gradients [8] and therefore enable the realization of tightly

conﬁning traps. The ﬂexibility of designing complex current and charge patterns on the chip

allows for considerable freedom to engineer ‘potential landscapes‘ for neutral atoms. This has

resulted in numerous designs of atom-optical elements such as traps, guides, beams splitters

and interferometers [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] with possible applications ranging from quantum

information processing [14, 15] to high precision measurements [16]. Even though many of

these designs have been demonstrated experimentally [7, 17, 18], there have been enormous

diﬃculties to realize a coherent beam splitter using microscopically tailored static or slowly

varying ﬁelds [19].

Most of these diﬃculties stem from the fact that Maxwell’s equations constrain the free-

dom to design static magnetic potentials. One consequence is that the number of potential

minima created is less or equal to the number of wires used [20]. Whereas regular strongly

conﬁning potential minima are created from quadrupole ﬁelds, the merging and splitting

relies on higher order multipoles and thus results in a signiﬁcantly weaker conﬁnement.

Consequently any dynamic splitting of a potential passes through a weakly conﬁning region

and creates an additional unwanted minimum, a loss channel. This splitting two in two

makes the central splitting region very unstable and therefore truly adiabatic manipulations

are hard to perform [21].

These deﬁciencies can be overcome by using not only static ﬁelds but combining them

with oscillating radio frequency (RF) or micro-wave near ﬁelds. The adiabatic dressed state

potentials created in this way do not show the unwanted loss channels, keep the conﬁnement

tight during the splitting process and consequently allows for a smooth transition from a

single to two channels. Well controlled coherent splitting and simultaneous tight conﬁnement

of the atomic motion can be achieved even far away from the chip surface [22]. In addition

adiabatic potentials permit the creation of non-trivial topologies like, for example, closed

path interferometers and ring geometries. Also smooth transformations between diﬀerent

2

potential forms can be achieved.

In the present work we ﬁrst discuss the theoretical foundations of the underlying coupling

creating the adiabatic potentials and present their advantages. These are then applied to

create basic atom optical elements such as a double-well, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer

and a ring trap.

II. THEORY OF DRESSED ADIABATIC RF POTENTIALS

We develop the theory by starting with the initial approach by Zobay and Garraway [23]

and extending it to fully account for the vector properties of the magnetic ﬁelds involved.

Only accounting for the latter leads to a complete description of the underlying couplings

and the increased versatility of the resulting potentials. We consider an alkali atom in a

hyper-ﬁne level designated by the quantum number F . Assuming that F remains a good

quantum number even in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the atomic dynamics is governed

by the Hamiltonian

Hinitial = gF µBB(r, t) · F.

(1)

Here gF is the g-factor of the hyper-ﬁne level and F the angular momentum operator. We

assume B(r, t) to consist of a static part BS(r) and an oscillatory part of the form BO(r, t) =

BA

RF(r) cos(ωt) + BB

RF(r) cos(ωt + δ). As a ﬁrst step we use the unitary transformation US
to transform the Hamiltonian into a frame where the interaction of the atom with BS(r)
is diagonal, i.e. U †SBS(r) · FUS = [RSBS(r)] F = |BS(r)|Fz. Here we have exploited that
rotating the operator F by using US is equivalent to rotating the magnetic ﬁeld vector BS(r)
by applying the appropriate rotation matrix RS. The operator Fz can be represented as

a diagonal matrix with the entries −F ≤ mF ≤ F and mF denoting the magnetic hyper-

ﬁne sub-levels. We proceed by applying another unitary operation UR = exp [−iFzωt] which

eﬀectuates a transformation into a frame that rotates with the angular velocity ω around the

local direction of the static ﬁeld eS =

. The application of UR leads to the emergence

of additional terms that oscillate with the frequency 2ω.

In the so-called rotating wave

approximation - which we employ in the following - the oscillating terms are neglected. The

III. REALIZING ATOM-OPTICAL ELEMENTS

A. A double-well potential - time-dependent and static interferometry schemes

As a ﬁrst example we consider the creation of a double-well potential starting from a Ioﬀe-

Pritchard trap [7, 30] which is one of the most commonly used trapping ﬁeld conﬁguration.

Its magnetic ﬁeld is given by BS(r) = Gρ [cos φex − sin φey] + BIez. Here G is the gradient

of the quadrupole ﬁeld and BI the homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength. We superimpose a
homogeneous oscillatory RF ﬁeld of the form BA

RF(r) = 0. The unitary
transformation which diagonalizes the static part of the Hamiltonian (1) is given by US =

FIG. 1: (a) Experimental realization of the double-well conﬁguration. The quadrupole ﬁeld is

created by a surface-mounted DC four-wire structure. The RF ﬁeld is generated by a central broad

AC wire. Suﬃciently close to the surface its RF ﬁeld can considered to be homogeneous.

(b)

Depending on the actual RF ﬁeld strength either a single- or a double-well is established. The

potential bottom of the individual curves has been subtracted. (c,d) Longitudinally modulating

the shape of the RF wire results in a z-dependent variation of the RF amplitude. This can either be

used to achieve a conﬁnement along the longitudinal (z-)axis (c) or a spatially dependent splitting

which would result in an interferometer (d). Undesirable variations of the potential bottom can be

for example compensated by placing a charged wire underneath the chip (red structure).

5

In ﬁgure 1a we present how a highly integrated realization of such a ﬁeld setup could look

like. The quadrupole ﬁeld is generated by a four-wire structure carrying counter-propagating

DC currents. In-between these wires there is a broad wire ﬂown through by an AC current.

Suﬃciently close to this wire, the resultant RF ﬁeld can be considered to be homogeneous.

The Ioﬀe ﬁeld pointing into the plane of view is generated by additional wires which are not

shown here [7].

twofold:

The advantage of a RF interferometer over a static two-wire conﬁguration [11, 24, 25] is

(1) The capability of performing a smooth transition from a true single well to a double-

well, by varying any of the parameters △, BRF and BI. In contrast, in the static case one

encounters a transition from two vertically to two horizontally split minima, if the strength

of a homogeneous bias ﬁeld is modulated [11]. In the vicinity of the splitting region this

leads to unwanted tunneling processes into the second vertical (loss) channel just before the

intended splitting sets in [24]. This poses a severe obstacle for establishing an adiabatic

process.

(2) The RF adiabatic potential keeps much tighter conﬁning wells even far away from the

ﬁeld generating structures, i.e. the chip surface. This can be illustrated considering an atom

chip with structure size d. For the sake of simplicity the quadrupole for the RF setup shall

be created by a sideguide conﬁguration [7] in a distance d above the chip surface. The static

implementation of the double-well consists of two wires separated by 2d [21]. Provided that

the wire current I and BI are equal for both setups and assuming for simplicity △ = 0 the

trap frequencies and the height of the barrier between the wells obey

ωT,static

(6)

The essence of these expressions is their scaling with respect to the parameter d which

refers not only to the structure size but also to the distance of the potential wells to the

chip surface. Compared to the static two-wire case, a similar RF trap allows for realizing

the same conﬁnement with larger structures and thus farther away from the chip surface.

The latter is of particular importance as hereby coherence-destroying surface interactions

[26, 27] are strongly inhibited. The stronger increase of the potential barrier in the RF case

is advantageous as it permits a true spatial separation of trapped atom clouds even for small

splitting distances. Moreover, the RF potentials can be shown to be orders of magnitude

FIG. 2: (a) Experimental setup for realizing a ring shaped potential. The static quadrupole

ﬁeld is generated by a three wire conﬁguration. The two outer wires also carry RF currents

which generate two phase shifted and orthogonally polarized oscillating homogeneous ﬁelds in the

vicinity of the quadrupole center. (b) Ring-shaped potential emerging from a double-well when

more robust against experimental ﬂuctuations and thus allow for a more precise control, for

example of the tunneling rate [21].

The outstanding potential of the RF technique to coherently control the motion of atoms

has recently enabled the demonstration of coherent splitting of a Bose-Einstein Condensate

(BEC) on an atom chip [22].

The potential bottom of the RF double-well increases proportional to (BRF − BC)2. This

provides an excellent mechanism to achieve conﬁnement in the longitudinal direction. A

z-dependence of the RF amplitude, i.e. BRF = BRF(z), can be achieved by shaping the RF

wire [29]. For example a wire geometry creating a symmetric increase of the current density

around z = 0, consequently, will lead to a symmetric increase of the RF amplitude (see ﬁgure

1c). Hence, depending on the actual value of BRF a three-dimensionally conﬁning single- or

double-well is achieved. Similarly a Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be realized by varying

the RF amplitude such that BRF(0) > BC and BRF(z)|

of the splitting region as indicated in ﬁgure 1d. The variations of the potential bottom can

7

be compensated by applying either a spatially varying Ioﬀe ﬁeld or an additional external

potential. The latter can be realized for instance by placing a charged wire underneath the
chip [28]. The corresponding electric potential reads Uel = − α

2 |E(r)|2 [7].

B. Ring potential

As a second example we construct a more complex trapping geometry by employing

two phase-shifted RF ﬁelds. We consider two RF ﬁelds of the form BA

In ﬁgure 2a we present how such setup can be realized in a highly integrated way. The

static quadrupole ﬁeld is generated by a three wire setup. The two outer wires also serve as

RF sources that are positioned such that two orthogonally polarized homogeneous ﬁelds in

the vicinity of the quadrupole are created.

The versatility of the potential (7) lies in the fact that by simply varying the phase

shift δ one can either accomplish a double-well or a ring conﬁguration. The double-well

conﬁguration with the strongest conﬁnement is achieved for δ = 0, i.e. vanishing relative

phase shift of the RF ﬁelds.

2 results in a smooth
transition to a ring-shaped potential of adjustable radius. This transition is shown in ﬁgure

Increasing the phase shift to δ = π

2b. The potentials shown are calculated for the typical set of experimental parameters

BI = 1 Gauss, G = 0.2 Gauss/µm, BRF = 1.3 Gauss and ω = 2π × 1.26 MHz . In order to

RF amplitude of the form BRF(z) = (BRF + G2
isosurface for G2

generate a conﬁnement also in the longitudinal (z-)direction we impose a modulation of the
RFz2). In ﬁgure 2c the mF gF E = kB × 1.1 µK
RF = 0.05 Gauss/m2 is depicted. The ring-shaped potential is thus capable
of conﬁning BECs as the typical energy scale associated to such matter waves is in the

nK-regime.

8

The setup is ideally suited to examine the collective ground state of ultra-cold atoms

trapped on a ring [31]. Also building a ring interferometer (Sagnac-interferometer) for matter

waves is possible. Coherence preserving loading of the latter could be done by preparing an

ultra-cold atomic ensemble in the static wire trap. Switching on the RF ﬁelds thereafter,

and establishing the appropriate phase shift δ leads to a well controlled transition to the

ring-shaped potential. Such traps are particularly suited for building gyroscopes or rotation-

sensors. Gupta et al. [32] have recently succeeded in loading a ring-shaped waveguide with a

BEC. Their setup consists of millimeter-sized coils forming a magnetic quadrupole ring with

diameters ranging from 1.2 to 3 mm. However, generating BECs which are phase coherent

over the entire ring is extremely diﬃcult in such a macroscopic trap. In order to avoid the

necessity of cooling to extremely low temperatures it is beneﬁcial to use small rings with

diameters of a few micrometers.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown dressed RF adiabatic potentials to be versatilely applicable to build atom

optical elements and oﬀer a number of signiﬁcant advantages over their static implementa-

tions. RF-based traps provide tight conﬁnement even at large surface distances and allow

for a smooth transition from a single to a double-well. Moreover, RF potentials are more

robust against experimental ﬂuctuations which is advantageous for instance for performing

tunneling experiments. This technique paves the way to the realization of complex coher-

ence preserving potentials on a micro scale by using simple and highly integrated setups.

This is of particular importance for such demanding applications as quantum information

processing and high precision measurements based on matter wave interference.

electrons

Abstract

We discuss the possibility of using pair-equations for the construction of the
eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ for valence electrons of an atom. The low-energy part
of atomic spectrum is found by solving the eigenvalue problem for Heﬀ. In this
way it is possible to account eﬃciently for the valence-valence and core-valence
correlations. We tested this method on a toy model of a four-electron atom with
the core 1s2. The spectrum obtained with Heﬀ for two valence electrons is in a
perfect agreement with the full conﬁguration interaction for all four electrons.

Introduction

The reliable and accurate ab initio methods for atomic calculations are necessary not
only for atomic physics and quantum chemistry, but also for application of atomic
physics to the investigation of the fundamental interactions. For example precision
calculations of Cs were necessary to test electroweak theory on the level of radiative
corrections at low energy (see [1] and references therein). Recent search for the possible
variation of the ﬁne structure constant α [2] in space-time also required large-scale
atomic calculations [3].

At present there are several widely used methods for calculations of many-electron
atoms. For atoms with one valence electron above the core the many-body pertur-
bation theory (MBPT) appears to be very eﬀective [4]. For the atoms with more
than one valence electrons the accuracy of the conventional MBPT techniques is not
satisfactory mainly because of the poor convergence of the MBPT for the valence-
valence correlations. Because of that non-perturbative methods are usually preferable
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, the core-valence correlations can still be eﬀectively treated with
MBPT. Because of that it was suggested to combine MBPT for the core-valence corre-
lations with the conﬁguration interaction (CI) for valence-valence correlations within
the CI+MBPT method [10].

In this method CI calculation for valence electrons is done with the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian Heﬀ. This Hamiltonian accounts for core polarization and screening of the two-
electron interaction between valence electrons. It may be formed within the Brillouin-
Wigner variant of MBPT. In practice most of the calculations were done within the
second order MBPT [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The operator Heﬀ is deﬁned for valence elec-
trons only. Therefore, CI+MBPT method is equivalent to the multi-reference MBPT

1

with the model space coinciding with the whole valence space. The use of the Brillouin-
Wigner variant of MBPT allows to avoid problems with intruder states, but leads to
the energy-dependent eﬀective Hamiltonian [16, 17].

CI+MBPT method has several important limitations:

1. The number of valence electrons should not be large. The accuracy of the CI

method rapidly decreases when this number exceeds 3 or 4.

2. Only the lower part of the valence spectrum can be presented accurately. For
the energies above the excitation energy of the core the eﬀective Hamiltonian has
poles and results of the CI+MBPT method may become unreliable [18].

3. The accuracy of the calculations is limited because the eﬀective Hamiltonian does
not account for the higher order core-valence correlations. With the second order
eﬀective Hamiltonian the typical accuracy for the transition frequencies is of the
order of a percent.

The ﬁrst two limitations are intrinsic to the method. In order to address the third one
it is necessary to go beyond the second order MBPT. One obvious way to do this is
the order-by-order approach. However, it is known that for atoms with one valence
electron the third order calculations are often even less accurate than the second order
ones. Besides, for atoms with more than one valence electron the third order is already
too complicated for practical use.

The arguments given above lead us to one of the variants of the all-order methods.
The coupled-cluster method is one of the most widely used [5]. It gives the nonlinear
system of equations for cluster amplitudes. In order to truncate this system it is often
restricted to SD excitations. The linearized version of the coupled-cluster equations
It
in the SD-approximation are also known as pair equations, or SD-method [19].
was used for the calculations of the atoms with one valence electron and proved to
be signiﬁcantly more accurate than the second order MBPT [20]. So, we suggest to
use CI+SD method instead of CI+MBPT for the calculations of the atoms with few
valence electrons.

In order to use the SD-method for the eﬀective Hamiltonian, we developed the
Brillouin-Wigner variant of these equations and added equations for the two-electron
amplitudes, which were absent in the one-electron atoms. That allowed us to form the
eﬀective Hamiltonian for valence electrons in SD-approximation.

As a test system for the CI+SD method we study a toy model of a 4-electron atom
with two valence electrons above the core 1s2. We use a very short basis set, for which
the 4-electron full CI is possible. That allows to test the method without addressing
such questions as saturation of the basis set and the role of the Breit interaction, which
we do not include here. This model was recently considered in [21] and appeared useful
for the study of the higher orders in the residual core-valence interaction.

1 Eﬀective Hamiltonian

It is well known that if we split the total many-electron Hilbert space in two subspaces
P and Q, P + Q = 1, the full Schr¨odinger equation can be equivalently rewritten in a
following form:

Ψ = P Ψ + QΨ ≡ Φ + χ,
(P HP + Σ(E)) Φ = EΦ,

2

(1)
(2)

where

Eq. (2) shows, that the eﬀective Hamiltonian in the subspace P has the form:

Σ(E) = (P HQ) RQ(E) (QHP ),
RQ(E) = (E − QHQ)−1

Heﬀ(E) ≡ P HP + Σ(E).

(3)
(4)

(5)

Note that this P, Q expansion is formally equivalent, for example, to the exclusion of
the small component from the Dirac equation. For practical purposes the particular
choice of the subspace P is very important. For atoms with few valence electrons it
is natural to associate this subspace with the valence one. In other words P subspace
corresponds to the frozen-core approximation P = PFC. This means that core-core and
core-valence correlations are accounted for on the stage of formation of the operator
Heﬀ, while all valence correlations are treated explicitly when solving Eq. (2).

Of course, for many-electron atoms the exact form of the operator RQ(E) is not
known and some approximations should be used. In principle, MBPT gives consistent
procedure for ﬁnding an order-by-order expansion of this operator in powers of the
residual two-electron interaction. In the lowest (second) order RQ(E) is substituted
Q(E) = (E − QH0Q)−1, where H0 is a one-electron operator. This leads to the
by R0
second order eﬀective Hamiltonian for valence electrons, which was used in calculations
[11, 12, 13, 14]. The complete form of the third order expansion for Heﬀ is still unknown
and is probably to complicated for practical use.

The most simple and compact variant of the MBPT expansion corresponds to the
choice, when H0 is equal to the Dirac-Fock operator of the core H DF
core. At least for
atoms with one or two valence electrons this may be also an optimal choice [21]. For
more valence electrons one may want to include, at least partly, the ﬁeld of the valence
electrons in H0. This leads to many new terms in the MPBT expansion [10], but gives
better initial approximation. In our calculations we use the Dirac-Fock code [22], which
allows for the ﬂexible choice of the self-consistent ﬁeld.

In the end of this section we want to mention that sometimes the whole wave
function (1) is needed. Then we can recover it from the solution of (2) with the help
of relation:

Ψ = Φ + χ = (1 + RQ(E) (QHP )) Φ.

(6)

We again can use MBPT expansion for RQ(E) here. If we need χ to calculate some
atomic amplitudes, we can use Eq. (6) to deﬁne corresponding eﬀective operator in
the subspace P . For the eﬀective operators one can use the random phase approxi-
mation with additional two-electron terms instead of the order-by-order MBPT [23].
This technique was used in calculations of E1-transitions [13], polarizabilities [24], and
hyperﬁne constants [18].

2 SD-method for the eﬀective Hamiltonian

As we mentioned above, the accuracy of the CI+MBPT method is limited because of
the neglect of the higher order corrections to Heﬀ. The SD-method allows to sum to
all orders the MBPT terms, which correspond to the one and two holes in the core in
all intermediate cross-sections of the Goldstone diagrams. Technically this leads to the

3

substitution of the one- and two-electron matrix elements in Heﬀ with corresponding
SD-amplitudes.

The explicit form of the SD-equation depends on the choice of the one-electron
operator H0, which is used for the initial approximation. The simplest form corresponds
to H0 = H DF
core, which we assume below. We expect that in analogy with the CI+MBPT,
this variant of the CI+SD method should be good at least for one- and two-electron
atoms.

The system of equations for SD-amplitudes splits in three parts. The ﬁrst subsystem
includes only amplitudes for core excitations. Therefore, these amplitudes do not
depend on core-valence and valence amplitudes and should be solved ﬁrst [19]. The
graphic representation of this subsystem is shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Note that all
equations are presented in a form, suitable for iterative solution. At ﬁrst iteration we
put all SD-amplitudes on the right-hand-sides to zero. That leaves the single non-zero
term in the equation for the two-electron SD-amplitude Fig. 2. As a result we get
non-zero two-electron amplitude, but the one-electron SD-amplitude is still zero. On
the next iteration both right-hand-sides in Fig. 1 and 2 are non-zero.

On the next step the one electron valence amplitudes and two-electron core-valence
amplitudes should be found from the system of equations shown in Fig. 3 and 4. It is
seen that they depend on each other and on the core amplitudes, which were found on
the previous step. This system again can be solved iteratively. Iteration processes on
the ﬁrst and the second steps converge rather rapidly because the energy denominators
for all diagrams are large, because they include the excitation energy of the core. The
latter grows with the number of valence electrons, so we can expect faster convergence
for the atoms with more valence electrons.

The one-electron valence SD-amplitudes, which are found from the equations on
Fig. 3 can be already used for the construction of Heﬀ. However, on this step we
still do not have two-electron valence amplitudes. These can be found by calculating
diagrams from Fig. 5. Corresponding diagrams depend only on the amplitudes, which
are already found on previous steps, so we can calculate two-electron valence SD-
amplitudes in one run. Therefore, the third step is rather simple and this is the only
new step, which was not used in calculations of one-electron atoms [19]. It means that
the SD-method is easily generalized for the many-electron case.

There are several questions, which we did not address above. First is the energy
dependence of the SD-amplitudes. That can be accounted for in a same way, as it was
done in CI+MBPT method. Second, we prefer to have Hermitian eﬀective Hamiltonian,
while the valence SD-amplitudes as given by Fig. 3 and 5 are non-symmetric. Thus,
we need to symmetrize them somehow. These questions will be discussed elsewhere
in detail. Here we prefer to give an example of the application of the CI+SD method
to a model system, which can be solved ‘exactly’ and the accuracy of the CI+SD
approximation can be therefore well controlled and compared to that of the CI+MBPT
method.

3 Toy model

Here we consider the atom with Z = 6 and 4 electrons in a very short basis set of 14
orbitals 1 − 4s1/2, 2 − 4pj, and 3, 4dj. Because of such a short basis set, we can not
compare our results with the physical spectrum of C III. Instead, we can do the full
CI for all 4 electrons and use it as an ‘exact’ solution. Alternatively, we can consider

4

the same atom as a two-electron system with the core [1s2]. In this case we can use
both CI+MBPT and SI+SD methods and compare their results with the known ‘exact’
solution.

As an even simpler test systems we can also consider the same system with 2 and 3
electrons. The core equations Fig. 1 and 2 are the same for all three cases. After they
are solved, we can immediately ﬁnd the correlation correction to the core energy by
calculating two diagrams from Fig. 6. The same correction can be found with the help
of the full CI for two electrons. Note that SD-method for the two electron system is
exact, so both result should coincide. In this way we can eﬀectively check the system
of equations for core amplitudes.

The iterative procedure for the core SD-equations converges in three steps and the

core correlation energy δEcore in atomic units is given by:

δEcore

Iteration
1
2
3

Diﬀerence
−0.006051 −0.006051
−0.006278 −0.000228
−0.006282 −0.000004
Full CI −0.006280 +0.000002

The diﬀerence 2 · 10−6 a.u. between the full CI and SD results is two orders of
magnitude smaller than the error of the second order MBPT, which corresponds to the
ﬁrst iteration and is probably due to the numerical accuracy (we store radial integrals
in the CI code [25] as real*4 numbers).

When core SD-amplitudes are found, we ﬁnd one-electron valence amplitudes from
the system of equations from Fig. 3 and 4. This allows us to form Heﬀ for one electron
above the core and ﬁnd the spectrum of the three-electron system. These results are
compared to the three-electron full CI in Table 1.

Finally, we calculate two-electron valence SD-amplitudes and form two-electron
eﬀective Hamiltonian. Two-electron full CI with Heﬀ is compared with four-electron
full CI in Table 2.

4 Discussion

SD-method for the system with valence electrons is not exact even for the two-electron
core [19]. Therefore we can not expect exact agreement between SD and full CI results.
We still expect higher accuracy for the CI+SD method than for CI with the second
order Heﬀ. Tables 1 and 2 show that this is the case. For the one-electron case both the
maximum and the average error decreases by the factor of 3 to 4. For the two-electron
case the error decreases even stronger.

Moreover, if the third order corrections are added to the one-electron SD-amplitudes,
as was suggested in [26], the accuracy rises by almost another order of magnitude. If we
include one-electron third order corrections to the two-electron eﬀective Hamiltonian,
the error in comparison to the SD-approximation even grows. The total number of the
third order two-electron diagrams is very large and at present we are able to include
them only partly. It is seen from the Table 2 that this improves the accuracy a bit
in comparison to the SD-approximation. However, we see that there are no dominant
third order diagrams, which are not included in the SD-approximation. In fact there
are many contributions of the same order of magnitude and of diﬀerent signs, so that
It is possible that complete third order correction
they strongly cancel each other.

would give even better accuracy, but any partial account of the third order may be
dangerous.

We conclude that in the many-electron case there is no point in including only
one-electron third order corrections to the eﬀective Hamiltonian or any other subset
of the complete set of the third order terms. That probably means that for a more
complicated atom it may be too diﬃcult to improve SD-results by including the third
order corrections. Note that for more than two valence electrons there will be also
three-electron terms in the eﬀective Hamiltonian.

We see that for the simple model system considered here the SD-approximation for
the eﬀective Hamiltonian appears to be few times more accurate than the second order
MBPT. It is still not obvious that this will hold for the more complicated systems.
As we saw above, the two-electron core is a special case for the SD method as the
latter allows to obtain the core energy exactly here. The advantage of the model
considered here is that we can compare results with the full-electron calculation, which
is impossible in the general case. The computational expenses for a full scale atomic
calculations within CI+SD method are signiﬁcantly higher that in CI+MBPT(II), but
are still lower than in CI+MBPT(III).

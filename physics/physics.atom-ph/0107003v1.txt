We employ laser cooling to intensify and cool an atomic beam of metastable Ne(3s) atoms. Using
several collimators, a slower and a compressor we achieve a 20Ne∗ ﬂux of 6 × 1010 atoms/s in an
0.7 mm diameter beam traveling at 100 m/s, and having longitudinal and transverse temperatures
of 25mK and 300µK, respectively. This constitutes the highest ﬂux in a concentrated beam achieved
to date with metastable rare gas atoms. We characterize the action of the various cooling stages in
terms of their inﬂuence on the ﬂux, diameter and divergence of the atomic beam. The brightness and
brilliance achieved are 2.1×1021 s−1m−2sr−1 and 5.0×1022 s−1m−2sr−1, respectively, comparable
to the highest values reported for alkali-metal beams. Bright beams of the 21Ne and 22Ne isotopes
have also been created.

I. BRIGHTENING RARE-GAS ATOMIC BEAMS

The eﬃciency with which metastable rare gas atoms can be produced in gas discharge sources is notoriously low,
usually only on the order of 10−5 with the highest reported value being 10−3 for helium [1]. Traditionally, therefore,
metastable rare gas atomic beams have shown much smaller ﬂux and density than alkali-metal beams. In recent years,
several groups [2–17] have tried to bridge this gap by employing laser cooling techniques [18] to intensify rare gas
beams. At the same time, atomic beams could be made slow and monochromatic.

The principle of beam intensiﬁcation using laser manipulation of atomic trajectories was illustrated by Sheehy et
al in a 1990 paper [19]. The essential element in any such scheme is a laser collimator, whose purpose is to increase
the solid angle under which atoms can leave the source and still contribute to the beam ﬂux further downstream.
This is achieved by cooling the velocity component transverse to the atomic beam axis. The collimator completely
determines the maximum gain in beam ﬂux that can be obtained with laser cooling. Without collimation, the ﬂux of
atoms through a constant area decreases geometrically with its distance from the source; with collimation, this ﬂux
is essentially constant. Collimators for rare gas atomic beams have been employed by several groups [2–5,11–15,17].
Since transverse cooling takes a certain time and thus a certain transverse distance, laser collimation inevitably
leads to large-diameter atomic beams whose density may be rather low despite the increased beam ﬂux. The solution
to this, according to Ref. [19], is to focus the beam and re-collimate it at the focal point. This idea was implemented
in its purest form by Hoogerland et al [2] who used a separate magneto-optical lens (MOL) followed by a second
collimator. Scholz et al [6], Nellissen et al [7] and Schiﬀer et al [8] developed a magneto-optical compressor (MOC)
in which both focusing and collimation occur within the same device. The mayor diﬀerence between a MOL and a
MOC is the time spent within the device interacting with the laser ﬁelds: a compressor is basically a lens with a
focal length shorter than the length of the interaction region. In order for the length of the MOC to stay within
reasonable limits, laser slowing of the atomic beam [18,20] between collimator and compressor is necessary. A MOC
device has since been applied to rare gas beams by Buckman and coworkers [10,11] and by Koolen [3]. Koolen used
a lens in combination with a compressor to increase the spatial capture range of the device. Labeyrie et al [16] have
also reported on the use of a MOL.

In this paper we describe our solution to brightening rare gas atomic beams, using all the devices mentioned above
extended with additional cooling stages. This setup stands out because it produces the highest ﬂux (6×1010 Ne(3s)3P2
atoms/s) in a concentrated beam of any rare-gas atomic beam setup reported to date, comparable even to the brightest
available alkali-metal beam [21].

Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the neon beam line, with ﬁve separate laser cooling stages used to create an
intense beam of cold atoms. In all cooling stages we use the Ne(3s) 3P2 ↔(3p) 3D3 optical transition at a wavelength

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. Overview

λ = 640.225 nm. Important parameters for this transition are the linewidth Γ = 8.5(2π)MHz, saturation intensity
Is= 42 W/m2 for circularly polarized and Is= 72 W/m2 for linearly polarized light, recoil velocity vR = 31 mm/s
and Doppler temperature TD = 203µK [18].

First, a collimator captures metastable Ne(3s) atoms from a discharge source and collimates them into a parallel
beam. Then, an additional transverse cooling stage reduces the divergence of the beam to a few times the Doppler
limit. In a Zeeman slower, the atoms are axially slowed to a velocity of 100 ms−1. Again, an additional transverse
cooling stage, positioned in between the two solenoids of the slower, reduces the divergence of the slowed atomic
beam. Behind the slower, a magneto-optical compressor captures the slowed atoms and funnels them into a narrow
beam, which then passes through a hole in a mirror and hits a detector that records the beam ﬂux achieved. The total
length of the beam line, taken from the nozzle of the discharge to the beam ﬂux detector, is approximately 3.3 m.

Table I gives detailed information about the position and length of the diﬀerent laser cooling stages and the position

of detectors. We take the z direction along the atomic beam axis.

B. Diagnostics

Four sets of wire scanners are positioned along the beam line for diagnostics. A wire scanner consists of a stainless
steel wire that can be moved transversely through the atomic beam by a stepper motor. By scanning the wire through
the atomic beam and measuring the current due to electrons emitted from the wire, a one-dimensional beam-current
proﬁle I(x) is generated. The beam proﬁle represents a line-integral over the two-dimensional density distribution
Φm(x, y) of the atomic beam along the length l of the wire,

I(x) ≈ ηAedw Z

Φm(x, y)dy,

(1)

with ηA the Auger detection eﬃciency of the wire, e the elementary charge, and dw the diameter of the wire.
Throughout this paper we use ηA = 1 since the exact value of the quantum eﬃciency of the Auger process for Ne(3P2)
atoms on metallic surfaces is not known (Hotop [22] reports ηA = 0.3−0.91 for stainless steel); however, ηA is certainly
less than 1 so that in this paper we eﬀectively always report a lower limit for the atom ﬂux.

The total ﬂux ˙N of metastable atoms in the beam at the position of a wire scanner is found by integrating I(x) over
the scan direction x. By comparing beam proﬁles taken with two successive scanners, information about the divergence
of the atomic beam can be obtained. We calculate the divergence Θ of the atomic beam by dividing the diﬀerence in
FWHM beam diameters di measured with the two wire scanners by their separation, Θ = (d2 − d1)/(z2 − z1).

Finally, on the way to a trapping chamber where the bright beam can be used, e.g., for collision experiments or
to load a magneto-optical trap [23], the atomic beam hits a conducting surface that can be moved in and out of the
beam’s path, which we use to measure the total useful atom ﬂux.

C. Laser setup

All laser cooling stages are operated from a single continuous-wave single-frequency ring dye laser (Coherent 899-21)
with a maximum output power of ≈ 1 W when pumped with 10 W of light from an Argon ion laser (Coherent Innova
315). We typically set the dye laser output to 700 mW; this is the output power used for the experiments reported
here unless explicitly noted otherwise. The laser is locked to a frequency that is shifted from the Ne (3s) 3P2 ↔ (3p)
3D3 transition by using Zeeman-tuned saturated absorption spectroscopy. This ”global detuning” ∆L of the dye laser
is normally set at ∆L = −1.8Γ for reasons that will become apparent below. Beams for the various cooling stages
are split oﬀ by combinations of half-wave plates and polarizing beam-splitter cubes. Two acousto-optic modulators
(AOMs) are used to shift the laser frequency for the collimator (80 MHz AOM) and the Zeeman slower (400 MHz).
Spherical and cylindrical telescopes are used to expand the laser beams to the required sizes; generally we expand
a laser beam such that its FWHM diameters in the x- and y-directions approximately match the spatial extent of
a cooling stage’s interaction region; in this case the edges of the interaction region are irradiated at half the central
intensity. Then, 50% of the power falls within the interaction area and the average intensity hIi is 72% of the peak
value.

Table I gives details on the laser beam characteristics of each cooling stage.

D. Metastable atom source

The beam line starts with a liquid nitrogen cooled source that produces a beam of metastable 20Ne(3s) 3P2 atoms
in a DC discharge that runs through the nozzle of a supersonic expansion. The average axial velocity of the atoms is
480 m/s with a FWHM width of 100 m/s (corresponding to a source temperature of 200 K and a longitudinal beam
temperature of 4 K); the center-line intensity for 20Ne(3s)3P2 atoms is 2 × 1014 s−1sr−1. Other high-energy products
emerging from the source are atoms in the metastable 3P0 state, metastable atoms of the isotopes 21Ne and 22Ne,
and UV photons.

E. Collimator

About 40 mm after the source, the atoms enter the collimator in which they are captured and collimated by a
two-dimensional optical molasses [18]. For the molasses beams we use curved wave fronts to achieve a large capture
angle while keeping the cooling time as short as possible. To minimize the required laser power, the curved wave
fronts are produced by using the zig-zag method as we reported earlier [2]. Linearly polarized laser light is injected
at an angle β(∆z = 0) with respect to the plane perpendicular to the atomic beam axis between two 150 mm long,
nearly parallel mirrors placed 60 mm apart. With each reﬂection, β(∆z) is reduced by an amount α = 0.85 mrad,
half the angle between the mirrors. The Doppler shift ∆D experienced by the atoms in the collimator is given by

with v|| and v⊥ the longitudinal and transverse velocity of the atoms. With the condition ∆D + ∆L = 0 the resonant
transverse velocity of the atoms is

∆D = −k · v ≈ −kv||β + kv⊥,

v⊥(∆z) = −∆L/k + v||β(∆z).

(2)

(3)

At the entrance of the collimator this velocity is v⊥(∆z = 0) = 21 ms−1 for the experimental parameters we use, i.e.,
β(∆z = 0) = 130 mrad and ∆L = +65 (2π)MHz, resulting in a FWHM capture angle Θc = 2v⊥/¯v|| = 86 mrad. At
the end of the collimator at ∆z = 150 mm, i.e., after 12 reﬂections of the laser beam on each mirror, the resonance
velocity is reduced to v⊥(∆z = 150 mm) = 11 m/s. Clearly, this eﬀective detuning at the end of the collimator is too
large to provide the lowest possible divergence of the atomic beam; in addition it depends on the axial velocity of the
atoms. Therefore, an additional, short, transverse cooling stage is positioned immediately behind the collimator to
further reduce the divergence of the atomic beam. Here we use ∆ = −1.8Γ and β=0; in-vacuum mirrors create the
two-dimensional molasses from a single, linearly polarized laser beam.

Figure 2 shows experimental beam proﬁles taken in the x direction with wire scanner W1 (which is placed just
behind the collimator), and with scanner W2 placed 580 mm further downstream. The eﬀect of the collimator is
clearly visible: the atoms are captured and cooled in transverse direction, resulting in an atomic beam with a FWHM
diameter of dcol = 9 mm containing ˙Ncol = 1.1 × 1012 atoms/s in the 3P2 state. From the ﬁgure the capture angle of
the collimator is estimated at Θc = 80 mrad, approximately the same as found with Eq. (3). The measurements with
the second scanner then show a FWHM divergence of the beam of 10 mrad. This value could in principle be reduced
further by changing the detuning of the transverse cooling stage; the detuning chosen is a compromise that leads to
maximum overall output of the beam machine but which does not necessarily optimize each stage individually (we
discuss this further in section III).

Switching the collimation and transverse cooling laser oﬀ, the beam ﬂux decreases drastically, as shown by the
dashed line in Fig. 2b. This beam proﬁle contains, besides atoms in the 3P2 state, also unwanted products of the
source, i.e., atoms in the metastable 3P0 state, metastable atoms of the other isotopes, and UV photons. Therefore
a beam stop, consisting of a disc with a diameter of 3 mm, can be positioned in the center of the atomic beam just
behind the transverse cooler (see Fig. 1). This beam stop keeps unwanted products (including ground state atoms)
from reaching the end of the setup, while most of the laser cooled atoms pass around it, due to the diﬀerent nature
of the trajectories of cooled atoms versus uncooled atoms and UV photons.

The collimated atoms then enter a midﬁeld-zero Zeeman slower [18,20] in which they are decelerated by a counter-
propagating laser beam. The laser beam is coupled in by a mirror positioned in the vacuum behind the magneto-optical
compressor (Z3 in Fig. 1). The atomic beam can pass through a 3 mm diameter hole in the center of this ”slower

F. Zeeman slower

mirror” since the compressor greatly reduces the beam’s radius. The length of the slower is such that 10% of the
maximum possible scattering force is suﬃcient to slow the atoms down. The tapered magnetic ﬁeld coils (0.85 m
and 0.15 m long) are usually set to produce maximum ﬁelds of 275 Gauss and -175 Gauss. In combination with the
400 MHz detuning of the circularly polarized slowing laser, this means that atoms with initial velocities up to 500 m/s
should be slowed to a ﬁnal velocity close to 100 m/s.

We measured the longitudinal velocity of the atoms leaving the Zeeman slower by a standard time-of-ﬂight technique.
Figure 3 shows the measured velocity distribution of unslowed, partially slowed (second Zeeman solenoid operated
with reduced current), and fully slowed atoms. As expected, fully slowed atoms have a ﬁnal velocity of 98 m/s. The
measured FWHM width is 8.0 m/s in this case, corresponding to a longitudinal beam temperature of T|| = 25 mK.

During the slowing process the divergence of the atomic beam increases due to the reduction in axial velocity as
well as the randomness in the direction of the spontaneously emitted photons. To counteract this eﬀect, an additional
transverse cooling stage is inserted between the two solenoids of the Zeeman slower. Transverse cooling is possible here
because the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes between the two solenoids. Here we use a simple ”V”-shaped arrangement of two
in-vacuum mirrors to create the two-dimensional molasses from a single, linearly polarized laser beam. Reducing the
divergence of the atomic beam increases the ﬂux of atoms within the capture range of the magneto optical compressor.
We obtain a factor two increase in beam ﬂux behind the MOC in this way.

G. Magneto-optical compressor

Behind the Zeeman slower, the atomic beam passes through a magneto-optic compressor to reduce its diameter and
divergence. Figure 4 shows a schematic view of the device, which is basically a two-dimensional magneto-optic trap
where the magnetic ﬁeld gradient increases along the symmetry axis. Scholz et al [6] have given a description of the
motion of atoms inside a MOC.

Two pairs of σ+ − σ− laser beams are produced by bouncing a single σ+ laser beam on a set of in-vacuum mirrors.
Atoms interact over a distance of 2wz = 90 mm with the laser beams, whose average on-resonance saturation parameter
is hs0i = hIi/Is = 1.9 while the detuning ∆L = −1.8Γ.

The magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld of the MOC is generated by four permanent magnets mounted outside of the
vacuum system near the end of the mirror arrangement. The NdFeB magnets have dimensions 60×60×30 mm3 and a
magnetization of 1.15 T. At the entrance of the MOC a µ-metal shield helps to reduce the quadrupole ﬁeld gradient
to 0.1 T/m, which increases to 0.6 T/m at the end of the MOC. Given the initial ﬁeld gradient and laser detuning,
an initial resonance circle with radius rc = −∆L/(µB∇B)=10 mm exists within which all atoms will be captured and
funneled to the beam axis. Here, µB is the Bohr magneton.

Figure 5 shows beam proﬁles measured with the vertical wire of the third and fourth wire scanners. The eﬀect of the
MOC is very visible: atoms are molded into a narrow beam with a diameter of dMOC = 0.72 mm and a divergence of
8 mrad, containing ˙NMOC = 5 × 1010 atoms/s. This results in a particle density of n = 4 ˙N/(πd2¯v||) = 1.2 × 109 cm−3.
From the ﬁgure it is also clear that many of the slowed atoms arrive outside the capture range of the MOC and cannot
contribute to the ﬂux of the compressed beam.

The measured FWHM divergence ∆v⊥ = 0.84 m/s approximately corresponds to the FWHM transverse Doppler
velocity ∆vD = 0.68 m/s, resulting in a transverse beam temperature T⊥ = 300 µK. One might expect the transverse
temperature to be lower than this value, since sub-Doppler cooling is possible when atoms are suﬃciently near the
beam axis at the end of the MOC [8]. We have found, however, that the ﬁnal divergence is limited to approximately
the Doppler value by a Stern-Gerlach eﬀect. After the atoms exit the compressor’s interaction region, they still have
to traverse a large quadrupole ﬁeld which exerts a force [3]

~FSG = (~µ · ∇) ~B = −µBggmg ~∇|B|,

(4)

directed transverse to the beam axis, leading to motion away from the axis (this Stern-Gerlach force can be ignored
inside the MOC because there the optical forces dominate). Here, mg is the magnetic sublevel occupied by the atom
when it leaves the compressor’s interaction region and gg=1.5 the Land´e factor. We calculate that in our case Stern-
Gerlach forces contribute around 4 mrad to the divergence of the atomic beam [24], eﬀectively ruling out sub-Doppler
transverse collimation. (Of course, further collimation is possible once outside the range of the quadrupole ﬁeld.)

III. OVERALL PERFORMANCE

4

A. Detuning and intensity dependence

As mentioned earlier, the detuning used in the various stages is the result of a compromise that results from deriving
all laser beams from a single source using a very limited amount of AOMs. In Fig. 6 we show the dependence of the
beam ﬂux as measured behind the slower mirror on the overall detuning of the dye laser. A fairly sharp maximum
appears at ∆ = −1.8Γ, which was consequently chosen as the working point for the setup.

A similar compromise is necessary in order to ﬁx the distribution of optical power over the various cooling stages. In
general, all of these show increased performance with the on-resonance saturation parameter s0 up to at least s0 = 2,
requiring more than the nominal output of the dye laser to attain everywhere. The distribution of power apparent
in Table I is therefore the result of much empirical work. Figure 7 shows the dependence of the output of the beam
machine on the total laser power available from the dye laser. The ﬁgure shows that the output of the setup increases
with laser power in the entire range accessible to us. Consequently, we achieve the maximum beam ﬂux of 6 × 1010
metastable 20Ne atom/s at the maximum available laser output power of 1W.

B. Brightness and brilliance

In the previous sections we showed that, by using several sets of wire scanners, it is possible to measure the
characteristics of the atomic beam such as the ﬂux ˙N of atoms, the beam diameter and divergence. These quantities
can be summarized into values for the brightness R, brilliance B and reduced phase-space density ˜Λ of the atomic
beam. Following Lison et al. [21],

where ∆v|| is the longitudinal velocity spread and Ω the geometric solid angle occupied by the beam, Ω = π(∆v⊥/2¯v||)2,
with ∆v⊥ and v|| the FWHM transverse velocity spread and average longitudinal velocity of the atoms, respec-
tively [25].

Table II lists measured beam characteristics such as beam ﬂux, beam diameter, longitudinal and transverse ve-
locities, as well as local values of the brightness, brilliance and reduced phase space density calculated from these.
Looking at the measured beam ﬂux, going from the collimator to the end of the setup, about a factor of 20 in beam
ﬂux is lost. This is mostly caused by the fact that only a small fraction of the slowed atoms can be captured by the
magneto-optical compressor, due to its limited spatial capture range in combination with the rather large diameter
and divergence of the atomic beam leaving the slower. This eﬀect could be remedied somewhat by using an additional
MOL between slower and MOC [3]. Also, experiments show that the slower only slows a fraction of ≈ 50% of the
atoms that enter it to 100 m/s, probably due to imperfections in the slowing laser’s beam proﬁle as well as imperfect
optical pumping into the mg = 2 magnetic sub-level at the start of the slowing process.

The brightness and brilliance of the atomic beam increase drastically going from source to compressor. This is clear
from the last three columns of Table II, which give the values of the brightness, brilliance and reduced phase space
density at the end of the setup for diﬀerent operation modes of the atomic beam machine, going from limited operation
(source only) to full operation (all laser cooling stages on). Switching on the slower greatly decreases brightness and
brilliance due to the increasing beam diameter and divergence; the magneto-optical compressor compensates for this
loss. Comparing the operation with only the source on to the full operation mode, we see that the brightness and
brilliance increase six to seven orders of magnitude and the phase-space density nine orders of magnitude. Regrettably,
the latter is still seven orders of magnitude from the quantum limit ˜Λ = 1.

Besides 20Ne there exist two other stable isotopes of neon, the bosonic 22Ne and the fermionic 21Ne, with natural
abundance ratios of 20Ne : 21Ne : 22Ne = 1 : 0.0030 : 0.102 [26]. We investigated the achievable beam ﬂux of each

C. Isotope dependence

of these by scanning the dye laser over a 2GHz frequency range covering resonance lines of every isotope [27] and
recording the resulting beam ﬂux. Figure 8 shows the observed signal, with all of the isotopes indeed appearing. From
the areas under the appropriate peaks we conclude that the ratios of maximum beam ﬂux are 20Ne∗ : 21Ne∗ : 22Ne∗
= 1 : (0.0011 ± 0.0002) : (0.12±0.01), not far from their natural abundance ratios. The relatively low output of 21Ne
is easily explained by the fact that, due to its hyperﬁne structure, only part of such atoms can be manipulated at one
time (in fact, only the F = 7/2 state can easily be laser cooled), while in addition laser cooling for this isotope leads
to losses when there is no repumper laser present [18]. In the light of earlier experiments by Shimizu et al [28], who
observed that they could not trap 21Ne∗ unless they supplied repumper light, the beam ﬂux we achieve without it
is somewhat remarkable. Given the maximum output we obtained with 20Ne, the signals recorded imply that under
optimum conditions the setup can deliver a ﬂux of 7 × 107 metastable 21Ne atoms/s. In our experience, this is quite
suﬃcient for loading a magneto-optical trap with around 108 fermionic metastable atoms [23]. Of course, this value
could easily be increased by using an enriched gas.

By locking the dye-laser on a saturated absorption signal for 22Ne, we studied the spatial proﬁle of the cold and
intense beam of this isotope. As seen in Fig. 9, which shows proﬁles for both 22Ne and 20Ne measured with the
fourth wire scanner, the 22Ne atomic beam has virtually the same width and divergence as the 20Ne beam, and simply
contains about seven times fewer atoms than the 20Ne beam.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have described the implementation of an extensive beam brightening scheme based on manipulation of atomic
trajectories by radiation pressure forces. This technique is especially useful for metastable rare gases because of the
low eﬃciency with which these species can be produced in discharge sources. Our setup contains three elements that
are essential for reaching very high brilliance: (1) a collimator that increases the atom ﬂux, (2) a slower that reduces
both the average velocity and the velocity spread, and (3) a compressor that increases the density by reducing the
beam diameter.

The use of each one of these elements with metastable rare gas beams has been reported earlier. In most of these
cases, however, emphasis has been on reaching a high ﬂux of slow atoms in order to load a large number of atoms into
a magneto-optical trap (MOT). For such experiments, high brightness is not essential so that only a collimator and
slower suﬃce. This combination does not create an atomic beam in the traditional sense of having a small diameter
and small divergence, i.e., having high brightness. Precise data on useful ﬂux or brightness produced after slowing
have not been published. In this case one could compare MOT loading rates, but this is somewhat out of the scope
of the current paper.

In a separate paper [23], however, we will report on loading a MOT with our bright beam. Its small divergence
allows us to pass the beam through two 8 mm diameter ﬂow restrictions for diﬀerential pumping before entering the
trapping chamber, ensuring very low background pressure. The low velocity of the beam makes it possible to slow the
atoms down to the capture velocity of the MOT with a ≈20 mm long Zeeman slower positioned immediately before
the trap. In combination with the small diameter of the beam, this results in a very high ﬂux of atoms delivered
directly within the spatial capture range of the MOT, which was limited to a diameter of 18 mm by the size of the
trapping beams that we used. We have observed MOT loading rates of up to 3.6×1010 atoms/s, constituting nearly
65% of the total beam ﬂux. Because of this high eﬃciency, we are able to trap up to 9×109 metastable 20Ne atoms
and 3×109 metastable 22Ne atoms in our MOT under otherwise conventional trapping conditions. These numbers
are substantially higher than reported by others [4,13,29,30] for brightened but not compressed metastable atomic
beams.

Applications where high brightness as aﬀorded by the use of a MOC is clearly proﬁtable, e.g., atom lithography,
certain quantum optics experiments and loading hollow ﬁber guides, have been reported by Engels et al [9], Koolen [3]
and Dall et al [11,31], respectively. In the latter two cases, the experimental setups used are based on virtually the
same ideas as ours but use helium as the rare gas. The diﬃculties of manipulating helium, with its comparatively
small linewidth, have led to beam ﬂuxes that are smaller by a factor of 6 to 10 [3,11,31]. Dall et al report a ﬁnal
beam diameter of around 5 mm, suggesting a much smaller brightness was achieved but ﬁnal data on this is lacking.
Koolen’s setup produces a brightness of 1.0×1021 s−1m−2sr−1, quite comparable to our result. Engels et al, who also
use neon, report a beam ﬂux of 6 × 108 atoms/s, which is two orders of magnitude less than our current values, mostly
due to the use of a less eﬃcient collimator. Since, however, these authors achieved a much smaller beam diameter
(70µm) than we do as well as somewhat smaller divergence, their setup delivers a factor 3.3 higher phase space density
and a factor 2.3 higher brilliance.

For alkali-metal beams, the highest brightness, 6.3×1021 Cs atoms s−1m−2sr−1 has been reported by Lison et al [21].
Their setup uses a combination of a collimator, a slower and a lens plus re-collimator to produce a ﬂux of 2.6 × 1010

6

Cs atoms/s. Comparing these numbers to our own, we ﬁnd that they are nearly the same, notwithstanding the fact
that we are forced to start out with a much lower brightness atom source. This again points out that very large
gains in output are possible with beam brightening techniques which depend to a large degree on the eﬃciency of the
collimator used.

Finally, there is still room for improvement of our results. For one, the use of a magneto-optic lens between slower
and compressor could increase the ﬁnal beam ﬂux by a factor of ≈ 10 by eﬀectively increasing the capture range
of the compressor [3]. Also, outside of the region of strong Stern-Gerlach forces, sub-Doppler transverse cooling of
the bright beam is possible in principle. Given the limits of such cooling mechanisms [18], a FWHM divergence of
≈2.4 mrad can be achieved leading to a gain in both brightness and brilliance of another factor of 10.

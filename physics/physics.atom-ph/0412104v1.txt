Abstract. We review the achievements of the theory of polarization bremsstrahlung
of relativistic particles, including the case when both colliders have internal structure.
The main features which the relativistic eﬀects bring into the problem are discussed
and illustrated by the results of numerical calculations.

1. Introduction.

In this paper we review the results of theoretical studies of the polarizational
bremsstrahlung (PBrS) of relativistic atomic particles. Another review article from this
issue [1] is devoted to the discussion of the PBrS process during various non-relativistic
collisions. There a comprehensive historical review is given, and most of the terminology
which is used to describe the PBrS process is introduced. Therefore, wherever possible
we refer to [1] in order to avoid the repetition.

In what follows we focus on the speciﬁc features of PBrS (see ﬁgure 1b in [1])
which are due to the relativistic eﬀects. The latter can be subdivided into the following
categories. Firstly, there are eﬀects directly related to the relativistic velocities of the
particles involved in the process: the velocity of a projectile and/or the the velocity of
the orbital motion of electrons inside the colliders. To account for these eﬀects one
has to describe the dynamics of the colliders using the Dirac equation rather than the
Schr¨odinger equation.

The relativistic eﬀect of retardation, which modiﬁes the interaction between a
projectile and a target, we attribute to another category. Retardation implies that
the relativistic particle polarizes the target not only through the Coulomb ﬁeld, but
also via the ﬁeld of the transverse virtual photons (e.g. [2]), or, in terms of classical
electrodynamics, via the retarded vector potential [3]. The eﬀective radius of this ﬁeld
increases inﬁnitely as the velocity v1 of the projectile approaches the velocity of light
c. Therefore, the ultra-relativistic charge, v1 ≈ c, polarizes the target mainly via the
exchange of the transverse virtual photons.

Relativistic eﬀects in polarizational bremsstrahlung.

There are relativistic eﬀects due to the multipole character of radiation emitted by
the target electrons. The multipolarity of the PBrS radiation depends solely on the
magnitude of kRat, where k is the photon momentum and Rat is the (mean) radius of
the orbit of the electron who radiates. If this parameter is small, then the dipole-photon
approximation is applicable, if otherwise, then it is necessary to take into account the
radiation in higher multipoles.

Finally, in the case when both colliders are complex particles (for example, atom-
atom, atom-ion, ion-ion pairs) it is necessary to account for the relativistic Doppler
eﬀect and the abberation of radiation. These are important factors which modify the
PBrS of a relativistic complex projectile.

The role of the relativistic eﬀects mentioned above was studied in [4–14] in various
collisions of isolated atomic particles. In this paper we review the results obtained in
the cited papers.

The inﬂuence of a dense medium on the features of PBrS of relativistic electrons
was investigated in [15–19]. This issue is beyond the scope of our review and is not
discussed below. We do not discuss the properties of the ordinary BrS of relativistic
particles. The list of corresponding references (although not the fullest one) can be
found [1, 12]. Finally, the main topic of this review concerns the relativistic eﬀects in
the PBrS process, therefore, we omitted the description of general features of PBrS
in the non-relativistic domain as well as the historical survey. These could be found
in [1, 20].

In the ﬁrst two papers on relativistic PBrS formed in a collision of a charged
structureless particle with an isolated atom (ion) [4, 5] the process was treated within
the framework of the relativistic plane-wave Born approximation for the projectile and
in the non-relativistic approximation for the target electrons. The retardation eﬀect was
accounted for, whereas the emission of the photon via the polarizational mechanism was
considered in the dipole-photon approximation. The following two important features
were established in these papers. Firstly, it was demonstrated that the PBrS cross
section increases logarithmically with the energy ε1 of a projectile. This feature is a
result of the retardation in the projectile–atom interaction. Secondly, it was shown
that the shape of the angular distribution of PBrS, in contrast to the ordinary BrS, is
proportional to (1 + a cos2 θ) (θ is the emission angle) where the coeﬃcient a weakly
depends on ε1. This feature reﬂects the nature of the PBrS process in which the radiation
occurs due to the alteration of the induced dipole moment of the target during the
collision. We discuss these features in more detail in section 2.

Also, it was demonstrated [4] that the amplitude fpol of the dipole PBrS can be
expressed in terms of two polarizabilities, which deﬁne the dynamic atomic response to
the joint actions of the ﬁelds of the projectile and of the dipole photon. In addition to
the polarizability α(ω, q), which accounts for the (non-retarded) Coulomb interaction
between the projectile and the target, and which deﬁnes the PBrS of a non-relativistic
projectile (see Eq. (1) in [1]), there is another polarizability, β(ω, q), which describes
the dynamic response to the retarded vector potential created by the projectile. In the

limit q ≪ R−1
at both polarizabilities are expressed via the dynamic dipole polarizability
αd(ω) of the target. Small values of the transferred momenta q correspond to large
distances between the projectile and the target, r ≫ Rat, which are important for
the PBrS mechanism [21, 22]. This fact, known from the non-relativistic theory of
PBrS, was utilized in [4, 5] to derive the formulae for the PBrS spectrum and angular
distribution within the large-distance approximation (another term is ‘the logarithmic
approximation’ [21, 22]). In [10] the ‘logarithmic’ approximation was applied to study
the total BrS process (i.e. the polarizational and the ordinary channels) in combination
with the use of the local density method for the computation of αd(ω).

In [9] an approach was suggested for calculating the total BrS spectrum
in relativistic electron-atom scattering utilizing a relativistic modiﬁed Elwert-Born
approximation for the ordinary component of the spectrum but considering the PBrS
within the non-relativistic ’stripping’ approximation [23, 24].

The theory of PBrS formed in a collision of a charged particle with a many-
electron atom/ion was developed further in the papers [11–14] where the fully relativistic
formalism and the results of numerical calculations were presented. The formalism
developed in these papers accounts for the relativistic eﬀects of all types mentioned
above (with the exception for the Doppler shift and abberation which are irrelevant
in the case of a structureless projectile). The approach was based on the use of the
distorted partial wave formalism for the description of the scattering process. The
states of the target’s electrons were described in terms of single-electron relativistic
wavefunctions. The eﬀect of retardation and the multipole expansion of the emitted
photon wave were accounted for. It was demonstrated that the full relativistic PBrS
amplitude is expressed in terms of the multipole generalized target polarizabilities of
three diﬀerent types corresponding to the allowed combinations of the types of virtual
and emitted photons coupled in the amplitude. On the basis of the relativistic formulae
for the amplitude and the cross section obtained in [12, 13] the results, which had been
obtained within the frameworks of the various simpler approaches, were evaluated by
considering the corresponding limiting procedures. It was shown that the relativistic
eﬀects lead to noticeable changes in the spectral and angular characteristics of PBrS. A
more detailed discussion is presented in section 2.

The PBrS mechanism deﬁnes the emission spectrum in collision of two complex
particles, such as atoms or ions. The relativistic theory of such processes was developed
in [6–8] where the details of the formalism were presented and the analysis of a number
of physical phenomena and limiting cases was carried out. The important diﬀerence
between the radiation formed in the atom–atom (or ion–ion/atom) collision from the
collision of a structureless particle with an atom/ion is that in the former case both
colliders emit photons via the polarization mechanism (the ordinary BrS of the projectile
is negligibly small because of the large mass). The PBrS of the target, which is at rest
in a laboratory frame, bears the same features as in the particle-atom/ion collision.
On the contrary, the spectrum and the angular distribution of PBrS emitted by a
relativistic complex projectile is strongly inﬂuenced by the relativistic Doppler shift

and the abberation of radiation. This inﬂuence manifests itself diﬀerently, depending
on the magnitude of the photon energy ω measured in the rest frame of the projectile.
For high values of ω the radiation, measured in the laboratory frame, is concentrated in
the cone θ ∼ γ−1 (γ is the relativistic Lorenz factor of the projectile). For small values
of ω the angular distribution is nearly isotropic. Therefore, as it was pointed out in [7,8]
for suﬃciently high velocities of the collision there is a principal possibility to separate
the radiation from the two colliders. Another important feature of the BrS process at
relativistic velocities, which is also due to the Doppler and the abberation eﬀects, is that
the intensity of the dipole radiation formed in symmetric collisions does not vanish. In
some more detail these and some other eﬀects are discussed in section 3.

2. Polarizational BrS in collisions of structureless particles with atoms.

The BrS process in the collision between a relativistic projectile of charge Zpe and mass
m and a target atom is the transition of the projectile from the initial state (p1, µ1)
to the ﬁnal state (p2, µ2) accompanied by the emission of the photon. The energies of
the particle in the initial and the ﬁnal states are found from ε1,2 = (p2
1,2 + m2)1/2 (in
this section we use the relativistic system of units ~ = me = c = 1). This radiative
transition can occur via two mechanisms, as it is illustrated by the Feynman diagrams
presented in ﬁgure 1. The ﬁrst diagram describes the ordinary BrS amplitude, ford. The
two other diagrams represent the polarizational part of the amplitude, fpol.

functions, can be found in textbooks (e.g. [2, 25]). The description in the framework of
the distorted partial-wave approximation (DPWA) is also available [26, 27].

In what follows we outline the principal steps of the evaluation of the PBrS
amplitude fpol focusing on the diﬀerences between the full relativistic description from
the non-relativistic one. For the sake of clarity we assume that the spin of a projectile
is equal to 1/2, and, therefore, its bi-spinor wavefunction satisﬁes the Dirac equation
which accounts for the central ﬁeld of the target. It is a not severe restriction, and all
the formulae can be easily re-written for the relativistic projectiles of other value of the
spin.

As in the non-relativistic case,

the photon emission via the polarizational
mechanism occurs due to the virtual excitations of the target electrons under the action
of two ﬁelds: the ﬁeld created by the charged projectile (i.e. the ﬁeld of the virtual
photon) and the ﬁeld of the emitted (real) photon.

With the eﬀect of retardation accounted for, the ﬁeld of the virtual photon is

characterized by the 4-potential, Aν (ν = 0, 1, 2, 3), whose components are given by

The consistent treatment of the relativistic eﬀects in the PBrS process implies that
it is necessary to retain all multipoles when describing the the vector potential Aγ of
the emitted real photon:

The structure of the right-hand side of (3) is similar to the non-realtivistic case
(see Eq. (13) in [1]). The diﬀerence is that in (3) all the quantities which refer to the
particles are treated relativistically.

2.1. The limiting cases of the amplitude (3).

Let us demonstrate how the expressions for fpol, which one can derive within the
frameworks of simpler theories, follow from the general relativistic formula (3).

The non-relativistic dipole-photon limit of (3) one can obtain using the following
transformations. Firstly, carrying out the non-relativistic limit with respect to the
projectile, one notices that the vector potential A (which is due to the interaction
retardation) can be neglected because of the relation |A|/|Φ| ∼ v1,2 ≪ 1. Therefore,
only the Coulomb component the 4-potential Aν survives, where one uses D00(ω, r −
ra) = 1/|r − ra|.
Secondly, carrying out the limit k → 0 in (2) one makes a
a=1 ˆpa ≡ e ˆP where ˆP is the momentum operator of all atomic
substitution γAγ → e
electrons. The third step is to substitute γνAν with its non-relativistic analogue equal
to Zpe
i. As a result of these transformations the sum over
the negative-energy continuum in (3) becomes identically equal to zero, whereas the
positive-energy sum reduces to the non-relativistic limit of fpol (see Eq. (13) in [1]).

To obtain the PBrS amplitude within the framework of relativistic plane-wave ﬁrst
Born approximation (RBA) one substitutes the initial and the ﬁnal wavefunctions of
the projectile with the ﬁeld-free Dirac bi-spinors (see, e.g., [25])

Ψ(±)

pµ (r) = uµ(ε, p) eipr

(4)

where uµ(ε, p) is the ﬁeld-free bi-spinor amplitude, and arrives at the expression derived
in [12, 13].

If, within the RBA, one carries out the non-relativistic limit with respect to the
target’s states, and, additionally, the dipole-photon limit k → 0, the resulting formula
reduces to the expression which was obtained for the ﬁrst time in [4]:

Here q = p1 − p2 is the momentum transfer, R = b − q (bq)/q2 and the quantities
b0 and b constitute a four-vector bµ = ¯uµ2(ε2, p2) γν uµ1(ε1, p1). The ﬁrst term in the
brackets contains the non-relativistic generalized polarizability α(ω, q) of the target.
This quantity enters the formula for the non-relativistic PBrS amplitude, where it deﬁnes
the dynamic response of the target to the action of two ﬁelds: the Coulomb ﬁeld of the
projectile and the ﬁeld of the dipole photon (see [1], Eq. (1)). The second term in
the brackets is due to the retardation of the interaction between the projectile and the

responsible for the dynamic response of the target to the action of the retarded vector
potential A and the dipole-photon ﬁeld. Explicit expressions for α(ω, q) and β(ω, q) can
be found in [4, 12, 13].

Relativistic eﬀects in polarizational bremsstrahlung.

From formula (5) one easily derives

the PBrS amplitude written within
the frameworks of the non-relativistic Born approximation and the dipole-photon
approximation. Carrying out the limit v1,2 → 0 one obtains b0 = 1 and b = 0.
This results in fpol = −4π Zpe (eq) ω α(ω, q)/q2, which is a well-known result in the
non-relativistic theory of PBrS.

Finally, let us brieﬂy discuss the high-energy photon limit of the PBrS amplitude,
i.e. when the photon energy exceeds the magnitude of the K-shell ionization potential
ω ≫ I1s [12]. In the non-relativistic dipole-photon theory this limit is called the ‘striping’
approximation [23, 24]. In [12] this limit was considered within the framework of the
following approximation: relativistic description of the projectile but non-relativistic
treatment of the target. The eﬀects of the retardation and the emission into higher
multipoles are taken into account.

Similar to the non-relativistic dipole-photon case [28] the PBrS amplitude can be
represented as a matrix element of the eﬀective operator Veﬀ calculated between the
scattering states of the projectile. Omitting the details we present the ﬁnal result for
fpol in this limit:

These formulae generalize the result of the non-relativistic dipole photon treatment
of the PBrS process within the frame of the ‘stripping’ approximation [28, 29]. Indeed,
carrying out the limit k = 0 in (7) and substituting in (6) the relativistic wavefunctions
with the non-relativistic ones one obtains fpol = −ω−2hp2 |eael| p1i where ael is the
acceleration of the projectile due to the static ﬁeld created by the atomic electrons (see
Eq. (22) in [1]).

2.2. The relativistic DPWA and multipole series for fpol.

To derive the partial-wave series and the multipole series of the amplitude (3) one can
use the following procedure [12]. To start with one uses the relativistic DPWA series
for the wavefunctions Ψ(±)

pµ (r) (see, e.g., [2]):

Here a general notation na is used for the unit vector in the direction of a, Ωjlm(np)
and Ωjlm(nr) are the spherical spinors deﬁned as in [30], χµ stands for a two-component
spinor corresponding to the spin projection µ, the quantities δjl(ε) are the scattering
phaseshifts, σ is the Pauli matrix. The functions g(r) ≡ gεjl(r) and f (r) ≡ fεjl(r)
are, correspondingly, the large and the small components of the relativistic radial

wavefunction in the central ﬁeld of the target. The sum is carried out over the total
momentum j, orbital momentum l and the projection m of the total momentum.

The next step is to introduce the multipole expansions of the factors eγ exp(−ikr)
and exp(−iqr) (the latter appears in Aν from (1)) in terms of the vector spherical
lm (n) (λ = 0, 1) and the spherical harmonics Ylm(n) = nY(−1)
harmonics Y(λ)

lm (n) [30].

Finally, assuming that the states |0i and |ni of the target can be described in
terms of single-electron wavefunctions (see, e.g., [31]), one converts the sums over the
atomic states n from (3) into the sums over the quantum numbers, εi, ji, li, mi (i = 0, n)
of the core and the excited subshells. The bi-spinor single-electron wavefunctions,
Ψεijilimi(r), can be obtained by solving the system of self-consistent radial Hartree-Fock-
Dirac equations (see, e.g., [32]).

Having done all this and carrying out the intermediate algebra, one obtains the
lm (nk) and

following expression for fpol written in terms of the multipole series over Y(λ)
the DPWA series with respect to the initial and the ﬁnal states of the projectile:

The quantities P (λ)

the PBrS. They depend, apart from the quantum numbers ω, k, l on the combination
of the types of the real and the virtual photons entangled in the amplitude. For
a spherically-symmetric target there are three allowed combinations of virtual and

The most important feature of the formulae (10)–(12) is that they clearly
demonstrate that in the relativistic case the PBrS amplitude is expressed in
terms of the multipole generalized dynamic polarizabilities of three diﬀerent types
corresponding to the allowed combinations of the types of the virtual/real photons:
(a) αl(ω, q, k) corresponds to the longitudinal/electric combination, (b) β(1)
(ω, q, k) to
the electric/electric one, and (c) β(0)
(ω, q, k) to the magnetic/magnetic. Each of these
polarizabilities depends on the photon energy ω, its orbital momentum l (which deﬁnes
the multipolarity of the polarizability), and on the magnitudes of the momenta q and
k of the virtual and real photons. We do not reproduce here the explicit expressions
for the polarizabilities but refer to the papers [12, 13] where various representations are
given and discussed in detail.

In the non-relativistic limit (with respect to both the projectile and to the
target) and in the dipole-photon approximation (k = 0) the amplitudes P (e)
21 (ω, k, l)
and P (0)
21 (ω, k, l) vanish for all l. The only term which survives is P (l)
21 (ω, k, l) with
l = 1. The corresponding generalized polarizability α1(ω, q, 0) reduces to the non-
relativistic polarizability α(ω, q), and the partial amplitude P (1)
21 (ω, 0, l) reproduces the
non-relativistic expression (see Eq. (18) in [1]).

Let us note that the polarizability β(ω, q) introduced above in Eq. (5) is equal to

β(1)
1 (ω, q, 0).

Finally, we mention that the structure of the DPWA and multipole series for
the OBrS amplitude is similar to that of the right-hand side of (9). Therefore, to
obtain the total BrS amplitude, ftot = ford + fpol one substitutes P (λ)
21 (ω, k, l) in (9)
with T (λ)
21 (ω, k, l) are the OBrS partial
amplitudes [12]. In the non-relativistic limit, carried out with respect to the projectile
motion and the states of atomic electrons, and in the dipole-photon limit the DPWA
series (9) reproduce the formulae presented in [33].

The expansion (9) allows one to derive the DPWA and multipole series for the spectral
and spectral-angular distributions of PBrS (and the total BrS as well). The details of
the formalism and the ﬁnal results are presented in [12].

Aiming to point out the qualitative diﬀerences, which are model-independent,
between the relativistic case and the non-relativistic one we discuss the PBrS cross
section in terms of the relativistic plane-wave Born approximation.

We start with the discussion of the spectral distribution of PBrS, dσpol/dω. The

corresponding cross section dσpol(ω) = ω (dσpol/dω) is given by [13]:

Relativistic eﬀects in polarizational bremsstrahlung.

Here α is the ﬁne structure constant, q = |p1 − p2| is the momentum transfer.
minimum and maximum values are qmin = p1 − p2 and qmax = p1 + p2.

The ﬁrst term in the integrand, proportional to |αl(ω, q, k)|2, is due to the dynamic
polarization of the target by the Coulombic part of the ﬁeld of the projectile, whereas
the second term, containing the polarizabilities β(λ)
(ω, q, k) appears as the result of the
retardation of the interaction. In the non-relativistic limit (with respect to the projectile
and the target) and in the dipole-photon regime all polarizabilities but α1(ω, q, k) are
equal to zero. In this limit α1(ω, q, k) → α(ω, q), which is the non-relativistic dipole
generalized polarizability, and the right-hand side of (13) reduces to the non-relativistic
PBrS cross section (see Eq. (24) in [1]). Similar to the non-relativistic result the cross
section (13) weakly depends on the mass of a projectile.

l

An important distinguishing feature of the relativistic PBrS cross section is its
logarithmic growth with ε1 [4, 5]. Qualitatively, the reason for this is as follows. As
was already mentioned, unlike a non-relativistic particle, a relativistic one interacts
with the target not only by its Coulomb ﬁeld but also (in the ultra-relativistic case,
predominantly) by the ﬁeld of transverse virtual photons. The eﬀective radius of this
ﬁeld, Reﬀ, increases inﬁnitely with the energy of the projectile. The magnitude of
min ≈ γ−1qmin, with γ = ε1/m and
min, where q⊥
Reﬀ can be estimated as Reﬀ ∼ 1/q⊥
qmin = p1 − p2 ≈ ω/v1 [4]. As a result, the range of distances at which a projectile
eﬀectively polarizes a target increases. This leads to the growth of dσpol(ω) with ε1.

Quantitative description of this eﬀect can be carried out directly from (13) by
analyzing the contribution of the region qat ≥ q ≥ qmin ≈ ω/v1 to the integral (here
qat = R−1

at with Rat being the radius of the target). The result reads [13]:

The ﬁrst term in term in the brackets on the right-hand side of (14) corresponds to
the contribution of the Coulomb part of the interaction, and it remains constant as
the energy ε1 grows. The second term, which is due to the interaction retardation,
logarithmically increases with ε1. This feature was ﬁrst noted in [4, 5], where the PBrS
of a relativistic projectile was studied within the framework of the non-relativistic dipole-
photon description of the target. The result of these studies follows from more general
expressions (14) and (15). Carrying out the non-relativistic dipole photon limit, and

The logarithmic growth of dσpol(ω) with ε1 is illustrated in ﬁgures 2a,b where the
PBrS cross sections formed in the collision of a proton with a hydrogen-like gold are
presented. Because of the large mass of the proton its OBrS is suppressed by the factor
m−2 ∼ 10−6, and can be neglected. The data presented in the ﬁgures correspond to
two values of ω as indicated in the caption. The growth of the cross section, which is
nearly linear for high values of ln(ε1/m) in accordance with (14) and (16), is due to
the contribution of the terms containing β(0)
(ω, q, k) (see (13)). The
contribution of the terms proportional to αl(ω, q, k) is virtually independent on ε1.

Expression (16) generalizes the result of non-relativistic theory.

Indeed, putting
ε1 = m on the right-hand side one obtains the expression derived in [21,22], where it was
called the ‘logarithmic approximation’ for PBrS. Let us note here that the OBrS cross
section of a relativistic projectile in collision with a neutral target is almost independent
on ε1 for high velocities of the projectile, v1 ≤ 1. Therefore, the total cross section also
increases logarithmically with ε1.

In the case of an ultra-relativistic electron or positron (me = Z 2

p = 1) scattering
on a neutral target there is a peculiar feature of the total BrS cross section which
is clearly distinct from the non-relativistic case. To demonstrate it we consider the
limit of high energy photons when ω ≫ I1s, and one can use the approximate formula
for the dipole polarizability αd(ω) ≈ −Z/ω2 (Z stands for the number of atomic
electrons which for a neutral atom coincides with the atomic number). The PBrS
cross section (16) reduces to dσpol(ω) ≈ 16α/3 Z 2 ln(qatε1/ω) where we used v1 = 1 and
qmin = ω. In the ‘logarithmic approximation’ the OBrS cross section is given by (see,
e.g., [25]) dσord(ω) ≈ 16α/3 Z 2 ln(1/qat). In the same approximation one can neglect
the interference term and derive the following expression for the total BrS cross section:

dσtot(ω) ≈ dσord(ω) + dσpol(ω) ≈ Z 2 16α

Apart from the factor Z 2 the right-hand side of this equation reproduces the formula
for the cross section of BrS emitted by a slow free electron in the collision with an
ultra-relativistic electron or positron [25]. This coincidence is not accidental and has
clear qualitative explanation [4]. For ω ≫ I1s the atomic electrons can be treated as free
ones. If Zα ≪ 1 then the velocities of all atomic electrons are small compared to that of
the projectile. Then, the total BrS amplitude can be written as the sum of three terms
ftot = ZF1 + ZF2 + F3. Here F1 denotes the amplitude of the photon emission by the
projectile electron/positron interacting with a free atomic electron, F2 is the amplitude
of the emission by the atomic electron during this interaction, and F3 is the amplitude
due to the interaction of the projectile with the nucleus. As known (see, e.g., [25]),
the BrS amplitude of an ultra-relativistic electron/positron scattered from a free slow
particle depends on the particle’s charge and does not depend on its mass. Therefore,
the sum of two terms, ZF1 + F3 is identically equal to zero, and ftot reduces to ZF1,
i.e. only atomic electrons radiate in this process. In a way, this result is opposite to the
’stripping’ eﬀect in the non-relativistic BrS, when dσtot(ω) in electron-atom collision
reduces to that on the bare nucleus if ω ≫ I1s (see Eq. (6) in [1]). The qualitative
explanation of this diﬀerence between the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic cases
is as follows. In the former case, the range of distances between the projectile and the
target important in the PBrS process can be estimated as Reﬀ ∼ 1/qmin ≈ v1/ω. This
value is much smaller than the photon wavelength λ = 2π/ω. Therefore, the dipole
approximation can be applied for the system ’the projectile + the target’. The only
allowed radiation in this system in the range ω ≫ I1s (the limit of quasi-free atomic
electrons) is that by a projectile on the nucleus. As was already mentioned, in the ultra-
relativistic case Reﬀ ∼ 1/q⊥
min ≈ γ/ω. As v1 → 1 and γ → ∞ these distances increase
unrestrictedly and are much greater than λ. The retardation eﬀects in the interaction
between the projectile and the atomic electron become important, so that the dipole
approximation is inapplicable to this system. This leads to the diﬀerence of (17) from
its non-relativistic analogue.

The retardation, as well as the relativistic and higher multipoles eﬀects, strongly
modify not only the PBrS spectral distribution but the spectral-angular distribution as
well [13]. The spectral-angular distribution can be written in the form of series over the
Legendre polynomials Pl(cos θ):

here θ is the emission angle (measures with respect to p1). The coeﬃcients alk (ω) depend
on the photon energy and are the bi-linear forms of the relativistic polarizabilities
αl(ω, q, k) and β(1,2)
(ω, q, k). The explicit formulae for alk (ω), obtained within the
DPWA and the relativistic Born approximation, can be found in the cited paper (see
also [12]).

The quantity β(ω) is frequently called a (dipole) coeﬃcient of angular anisotropy.

Let us point to the diﬀerences between (18) and (19). The ﬁrst one, already
discussed above, concerns the diﬀerent dependence of the factors dσpol(ω) and dσNR
pol (ω)
on ε1. The former increases proportionally to ln(ε1) and this is due to the retardation.
The second diﬀerence, a rather obvious one, is reﬂected by an inﬁnite number of terms on
the right-hand side of (18), which are due to the inﬁnite number of the photon multipoles
taken into account, in contrast to the two terms in (19). Finally, there is a ‘hidden’
diﬀerence which is related to the relativistic description of the internal dynamics of the
target rather than to the multipole character of the radiation. The easiest way to trace
the origin of this diﬀerence is to consider the contribution of only dipole photons to the
series in (18). The momentum of a dipole photon is l = 1, therefore only the amplitudes
P (l,e,m)
(ω, k, 1) (see (10)–(12)) will contribute to the PBrS amplitude (9). Then, instead
21
of (18) one obtains [13]:

It is seen that in contrast to (19) the angular distribution of the relativistic dipole
radiation contains the term proportional to P1(cos θ). As a result, the angular
distribution becomes asymmetric with respect to the transformation θ −→ π − θ.

The reason for this eﬀect is as follows.

If the target is treated within the non-
relativistic framework then the dipole photons emitted via the polarizational mechanism
belong to the ‘electric’ type [25]. This statement is valid for arbitrary velocities of the
Indeed, for v1 ≪ 1 the PBrS amplitude is proportional to α(ω, q) (see
projectile.
Eq.
(1) in [1]) which couples the Coulomb ﬁeld of a projectile and the ﬁeld of the
‘electric’ dipole photon. For relativistic velocities, v1 ≤ 1, the amplitude fpol contains
two polarizabilities, α(ω, q) and β(ω, q) (see (5)). The former couples the ‘electric’
dipole photon with the ‘electric’ dipole virtual photon. Due to the selection rules, the
angular dependent part of the intensity of the ‘electric’ dipole radiation contains the term
proportional to P2(cos θ) only [25]. In the most explicit form this can be illustrated if
one evaluates the angular distribution of PBrS using the ’logarithmic approximation’.
Then, either for a non-relativistic projectile [21] or a relativistic one [4] the PBrS angular
distribution is proportional to 1 + P2(cos θ)/2 ∝ 1 + cos2 θ, which coincides with the
angular distribution of radiation emitted by a rotating electric dipole [3].

In the case when the internal dynamics of the target is treated within the relativistic
theory, there appears a possibility to emit a photon of the ‘magnetic’ type.
If the
‘magnetic’ dipole radiation is treated separately, its angular dependent part also contains
the term proportional to P2(cos θ) only [25]. However, if both types of the dipole photons
can be emitted in a process, then their interference results in the term proportional to
P1(cos θ). This is exactly what happens in the relativistic PBrS. Using the general

It is seen that in contrast to the symmetric shape of d2σNR

pol (ω, Ω), the relativistic
angular distribution is asymmetric, being enhanced in the forward direction. The
asymmetry increases with ω and Z .

spectral-angular distributions is carried out in [13].

3. BrS in collision of two relativistic complex particles.

In this section we outline the speciﬁc features which appear in the BrS process when
both of the colliders, a projectile and a target, are complex particles (atoms, ions). It
is assumed that the relative motion of the colliders occurs with relativistic velocities (in
contrast to section 4 in [1] where the non-relativistic collisions were considered), whereas
the internal dynamics of the colliders is described in non-relativistic terms. The theory
of this process was developed in [6–8] where one can ﬁnd the details of the formalism
as well as the analysis of a number of physical phenomena and the limiting cases.

In what follows we mark all the quantities referring to a projectile atom (or ion)
with the index ‘1’, the index ‘2’ is designated for a target atom/ion which is at rest (in
the laboratory frame) before the collision.

The atomic system of units is used.
The Feynman diagrams describing the amplitude of the process are presented in
ﬁgure 4. The upper double line in each diagram refers to the projectile, the lower line
describes the target, the dashed line marked with (ω, k) stands for the emitted photon,
and the inner dashed line describes the (retarded) interaction between the colliders. The
initial, intermediate and ﬁnal states of each collider are characterized with the energy
(this includes the rest energy, the kinetic energy and the energy due to the internal
dynamics) and the momentum. The two upper diagrams describe the amplitude f1 of
the photon emission by a projectile which is virtually polarized by the target, the lower
pair of diagrams represents f2, which is the amplitude of the photon emission by the
target. The total BrS amplitude is given by the sum f1 + f2.

In contract to the non-relativistic case (see section 4 in [1] or the original papers
[35, 36]), where the analytic expression for f1 can be obtained from that for f2 by
exchanging the characteristics of the atoms ‘1’ and ‘2’, in the relativistic collisions one
should take care on the Lorenz transformations of various quantities which constitute
the amplitudes. Therefore, to construct the amplitudes it is convenient, from the very

the four-tensor which describes the dynamic reaction of the particle to the action of
the ﬁelds of the emitted and the virtual photons, and Dµν(Ej − E′

µ (qj) and T (j)

To calculate the quantities J (j)

λν (ω, k, Qj) one can ﬁrst consider them in
the rest frame of the jth collider, and then recalculate into the laboratory frame using
the Lorenz transformations rules. This formalism is described in detail in [6–8], where
a careful analysis of the kinematic domains, which are of the most importance for the
BrS process, was carried out as well. Omitting the details of the evaluation and the
analysis we present the ﬁnal formulae for f1,2. These look diﬀerently in the cases: (a)
a collision of two neutral complexes (e.g., atom-atom), and (b) a collision involving an
ionic complex (e.g., ion-atom or ion-ion). The physical nature of the diﬀerences in the
formula will be given below.

In these formulae q⊥
j stand for the perpendicular (‘⊥’) and the parallel

(1 − v2
1/c2)1/2 is the relativistic Lorenz factor. The quantity ω is the photon energy
measured in the laboratory frame (the rest frame of the target). The photon emitted
by the projectile and measured in its rest frame also has energy ω, however, due to
the Doppler eﬀect, in the laboratory frame this energy is changed according to the
rule ω → ˜ω = γω(1 − β cos θ), where β = v1/c and θ is the emission angle in the
laboratory frame. The notations Zj stand for the charges of the nucleus, Zj (in (23))
are the net ionic charges, F (j)(q) denote the form-factors. The functions α(j)(ω, q) are
non-relativistic generalized dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the colliders, α(1)
d (ω) are
dynamic dipole polarizabilities.

The amplitude f2 from (22) coincides with its non-relativistic analogue (see [1],
ﬁrst term in Eq. (31)). This coincidence has a clear physical explanation. The BrS
process in the collision of two neutral atoms occurs, mainly, when the distance between
the two nuclei is less than the radius of each atom, r ≤ Rat. At such distances the eﬀect
of retardation is small. Additionally, it can be shown [6, 7] that in such collisions the
parallel component of the transferred momentum is small, so that q ≈ q⊥
1 .

The component q⊥

1 is not aﬀected by the Lorenz transformation with respect to the
velocity v1. Therefore, as it is seen from (22), the amplitude f1 can be obtained from
f2 by choosing the frame moving with the velocity v1 (instead of the laboratory frame)
and, then, exchanging the colliders indices.

The BrS process in ion-ion (or ion-atom) collisions is governed by another regime [8].
In this case, due to the presence of the non-zero net charges, the colliders can be
eﬀectively polarized even being separated by a large distance, r ≫ Rat. Therefore,
the retardation becomes very important. This explains the factor q2
1 − ω2/c2 in the
denominator in the ﬁrst expression from (23). The dominating role of large distances
is also reﬂected by the fact that the amplitudes f1 and f2 are expressed in terms of
the polarizabilities α(1)
d (ω) rather than via the generalized polarizabilities
as in (22). Additionally, in contrast to the neutral atoms collision, both components,
the transverse and the parallel, of the vectors qj are important in ionic collisions, which
explains the additional terms in square brackets in (23).

Formulae (22) and (23) allow one to analyze the spectral and spectral-angular
dependence of BrS formed in collision of relativistic complex particles [6–8]. These
dependences include the contributions of the radiation by the target, the projectile and
the interference term. Not going to reproduce rather long expressions we mention the
most important features of these distributions.

For all types of the collision the leading terms in the angular distribution of the
dipole PBrS emitted by the target and the projectile can be presented in the following
general forms:

where the coeﬃcients C1,2 are independent on the emission angle θ. Omitting details we
mention that for atom-atom collisions these coeﬃcients weakly depend on the projectile
energy, whereas in the ion-ion/atom case they logarithmically increase with γ = E/M1c2.
This happens due to the same reasons which are mentioned above in connection with
the PBrS of a structureless particle (see (14), (16) and ﬁgure 2).

(cid:19)

It is seen from (24), that the radiation by the target, d2σ2/dωdΩ, is proportional
to (1 + cos2 θ), i.e.
is distributed as that emitted by a rotating dipole [3]. This is
a common feature and it does not depend either on the type of the projectile (light,
heavy, structureless or complex) nor on the type of the interaction between the colliders.
Apart from the collisions of the atomic particles this dipole-type proﬁle of the angular
distribution was found in a neutron and a neutrino BrS process in collisions with
atoms [37, 38], and in nuclear collisions [39, 40]. Beyond the non-relativistic dipole
approximation and in the case when the internal dynamics of the target must be
treated relativistically, the proﬁle of the angular distribution strongly deviates from
the (1 + cos2 θ) law (see ﬁgures 3c,d).

The PBrS of the projectile, d2σ1/dωdΩ, has another angular dependence. As
mentioned above, the photon energy emitted by the projectile is Doppler-shifted, ω → ˜ω.
This results in the factor (˜ω/ω)2 ∝ (1 − β cos θ)2 which strongly deviates from one in
the case of high velocities, when β = v1/c ∼ 1. Additional modiﬁcation of the angular
dependence is due to the abberation eﬀect. The quantity ˜θ, on the right-hand side of
the second equation from (24), stands for the emission angle in the rest frame of the
projectile. In the laboratory frame this angle is becomes abberated and is related to θ
via cos ˜θ = (cos θ − β)/(1 − β cos θ) [3]. Therefore, the proﬁle of d2σ1/dωdΩ is deﬁned
by P(θ, β) ≡ (1 + β2)(1 + cos2 θ) − 4β cos θ. This function explicitly demonstrates a
remarkable feature of the PBrS by a relativistic complex projectile. Namely, it does not
contain the well-known peculiarity typical for the ordinary BrS, where the radiation is
concentrated in a narrow cone θ ≤ γ−1 in the forward direction. Indeed, the function
P(θ, β) exhibit an opposite property: the radiation emitted in the forward direction,
θ = 0, is less intensive than in the backward direction, θ = π. In the non-relativistic
limit the function P(θ, β) reduces to the dipole-type proﬁle P(θ, 0) = (1 + cos2 θ) [36].

On the basis of the detailed analysis carried in [7, 8] the following criterion was
formulated on the magnitude of the ratio ξ = (d2σ1/dωdΩ)/(d2σ1/dωdΩ) in diﬀerent
ranges of ω and θ. It was shown, that if the photon energy and the emission angle are
chosen to satisfy the inequality (˜ω/c)2
α(1)(˜ω, q⊥
, then the PBrS of
1 )
the projectile dominates in the total spectrum over the radiation emitted by the target.
In the inequality sign is opposite then the target radiates more intensively. Therefore, for
suﬃciently high velocities of the collision there is a possibility to separate the radiation
by the two colliders.

Another important feature of the BrS process at relativistic velocities, which is due
to the Doppler and the abberation eﬀects, is that the intensity of the dipole radiation
formed in symmetric collisions does not vanish. Indeed, if one considers two identical
colliders then the total amplitude of the BrS f1 + f2 6= 0 (see (23)). We note that
in the non-relativistic symmetric collision the emission of the dipole photon is strictly
forbidden and f1 + f2 = 0 (see section 4 in [1] or the original papers [35, 36]).

4. Conclusions.

In this paper reviewed the progress which have been achieved in theoretical description
of the PBrS process with account for the relativistic eﬀects. We concentrated mainly on
the polarizational part of the total BrS spectrum. This mechanism deﬁnes the emission
spectrum formed in collisions of heavy projectiles with many-electron targets. In the
case of a sctructureless heavy projectile the main characteristics of the spectrum can be
accurately computed using the algorithms which have been developed recently on the
basis of the formalism described in section 2. The main diﬃculty, on the numerical level,
is in the accurate and eﬃcient calculation of the relativistic generalized polarizabilities of
a many-electron target. Compared to the non-relativistic case this is a more complicated
problem, and at present we cannot state that these quantities can be eﬃciently computed
in arbitrary ranges of the photon energies, transferred momentum and the multipolarity
index. However, the calculations which have been already performed indicated that the
relativistic eﬀects of all types, – i.e. those related to the motion of the colliders, including
the internal dynamics, the eﬀect of retardation and the radiation in multipoles, must
be accounted for in order to obtain reliable results.

Note that if a relativistic projectile has the internal structure of a relativistic nature,
it is not necessary to develop a new formalism describing the PBrS emitted by the
projectile. Instead, the corresponding formulae can be obtained from those presented 2
using the Doppler and the aberration of light transformation as it is described in 3. With
slight modiﬁcations the formalism discussed above can be applied for other colliding
systems, where relativistic eﬀects are important. Calculations for relativistic heavy-ion
collisions are of interest because of recent experimental eﬀorts in this direction [41]. For
example, one can describe the BrS arising in relativistic collisions involving nuclei. In
this case the dynamic polarization of the colliders results in the photon emission via
the PBrS mechanism, and the main contribution comes from the non-dipole radiation

(quadrupole and higher).

For a light projectile, an electron or a positron, the total BrS problem cannot be
considered in terms of the polarizationa mechanism only. The full theory must include,
from the very beginning, the two terms in the amplitude, ford and ftot. As a result,
the total BrS cross section dσtot includes the ordinary dσord and the polarizational
dσpol parts, which are positive, and the interference term dσint which can be of either
sign. In the non-relativistic domain and within the dipole-photon scheme the features
of dσtot are known quite well (see, e.g. ( [1])). From the formal viewpoint the theory
of the BrS process of a light projectile, which incorporates all relativistic eﬀects, has
been developed. Indeed, the formalism for the PBrS presented in [12, 13] and sketched
above in section 2 conbined with that for the ordinary BrS [26] (see also [42] where the
relativistic DPWA is compared with simpler theories) allows one, in principle, to obtain
the characteristics of the total BrS. The calculation, within fully relativistic scheme, of
the cross section dσpol of an electron now can be implemented. For example, the data
presented in section 2 for a 3 GeV positron can be also attributed for an electron of
the energy ε1 ≈ 1.5 MeV, since the PBrS part of the spectrum is nearly independent
on the mass of a projectile. Thus, one can estimate the total cross section as a sun of
the two terms dσtot ≈ dσord + dσpol where dσord can be taken from the tables [43, 44].
This approach completely ignores the interference term dσint. The calculation of the
total BrS cross section based on the approximation dσtot ≈ dσord + dσpol were carried
out recently in [10]. This was done within the ‘logarithmic approximation’ and for the
dipole-photon radiation only. The relativistic eﬀects due to the internal dynamics of
the taget electrons were not accounted for as well. However, it is not at all evident
that the term dσint can be ignored on the basis of simple approaches. As ﬁgures 3
demonstrate, the relativistic eﬀects noticeably modify the angular distribution of PBrS
leading to the increase of the emission in the forward direction. Since the OBrS of a
relativistic projectile is also emitted mostly in the forward direction the interference of
the two mechanisms can be important. The approach which allows one to account for the
interference was proposed in [9], where analytic expressions and the numerical results for
the total BrS spectra from neutral atoms and ions were presented for electron scattering
at energies 10 − 2000 keV. In the cited paper the ’stripping approximation’, derived
initially [23,24] for a non-relativistic electron–atom scattering, was extended to the case
of the relativistic velocities of the collision. On the basis of this model approach (which
does not accurately account for the retardation eﬀects and for the multipole character of
the radiation) the analysis of the modiﬁcation of the BrS spectrum due to the inﬂuence
of the PBrS channel was carried out.

At present, there are no accurate numerical results on the total BrS spectra and
angular distributions of relativistic electrons/positron on many-electron targets which
account for all important relativistic eﬀects and for the two mechanisms of the photon
emission. Let us stress that such calculations will be an important step forward towards
precise comparison with the recent experimental data on the BrS obtained for collisions
of 10 − 100 keV electrons with various targets [45]. The mostly recent experiments [46],

where for the ﬁrst time the measurement of the absolute values of the BrS cross section
in electron scattering from noble gas atoms were reported, show some indications on the
signiﬁcance of the PBrS in the energy ranges in which the relativistic treatment of the
process is necessary.

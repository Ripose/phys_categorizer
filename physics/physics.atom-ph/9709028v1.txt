We report our investigations of X rays emitted during the muonic cascade in hydrogen employing
charge coupled devices as X-ray detectors. The density dependence of the relative X-ray yields for
the muonic hydrogen lines ( Kα, Kβ and Kγ ) has been measured at densities between 0.00115 and
0.97 of liquid hydrogen density. In this density region collisional processes dominate the cascade
down to low energy levels. A comparison with recent calculations is given in order to demonstrate
the inﬂuence of Coulomb deexcitation.

Exotic atoms are atoms in which an electron is replaced by a heavier negatively charged particle, e.g. µ−, π−, K−, p.

The simplest of these atoms is muonic hydrogen µp, which denotes a bound state of one proton and one muon.

After a free muon is injected into a hydrogen target it is slowed down and an excited muonic hydrogen atom is
formed via Coulomb capture [1,2], leaving the muon most likely in an initial state of 11 ≤ n ≤ 15 [4]. This is the
starting point for a complicated interplay of competitive collisional and radiative deexcitation processes, the so-called
atomic cascade, which ends with the muonic atom being in the 1s ground state. The possibility of a metastable 2p
state in muonic hydrogen is currently under investigation [3].

Muons, in contrast to the other possible particles, are not aﬀected by strong interaction. So they may serve as the

best probe for the investigation of these deexcitation processes.

At the investigated hydrogen densities, collisional deexcitation dominates from the beginning of the cascade to low n
states, depending on the target density and the kinetic energy of the µp atom [1,5–8]. The known collisional processes
are chemical dissociation, elastic collision, external Auger electron emission, Coulomb deexcitation and Stark mixing.
The importance of the last two eﬀects is due to the very small size of the neutral µp atom, which can penetrate
very deeply into the electron cloud of a neighboring H2 molecule, where it can “feel” the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the
protons.

In the investigated hydrogen gases, the transitions to the ground state are always accompanied by the emission of

muonic X rays; at liquid hydrogen density (LHD)‡, the X-ray emission probability is still 0.95 [7].

All these processes together make up the “standard cascade model” [1,5,6,9,10] which, despite its success, has one
severe limitation: this is the assumption that ǫµp, the kinetic energy of the µp atom, is constant throughout the
cascade.

A recent calculation [7,8] tries to take into account the time evolution of ǫµp for energy levels n ≤ 6. Due to
Coulomb deexcitation, complex energy distributions at various levels are expected. Coulomb deexcitation is the only
known mechanism which can accelerate µp atoms up to epithermal energies of ∼ 170 eV [7]. In spite of its importance,
Coulomb deexcitation is regarded as the least known process of the muonic cascade (neglecting chemical deexcitation,
which is important only at very high energy levels) [8]. Existing calculations of the Coulomb deexcitation cross
sections diﬀer among themselves by more than one order of magnitude [11–15].

Apart from the basic interest in exotic atoms, the understanding of the deexcitation of muonic atoms is of great
importance for various other phenomena, such as muon catalyzed fusion [16–18], muon transfer [19–21], diﬀusion of
muonic atoms [22], and nuclear muon capture [23,24]. The muonic case can also be used as a test for the cascade
in hadronic atoms [25] (e.g. π−p) where velocity eﬀects [26,27] severely aﬀect the evaluation of strong interaction
parameters [28,29].

For this measurement, the relative X-ray yields of the emitted muonic hydrogen Kµp lines – the corresponding
X-ray energies are Kα = 1.90 keV, Kβ = 2.25 keV, Kγ = 2.37 keV and K∞ = 2.53 keV – and their intensity ratios

1

serve as a tool to investigate the muonic cascade.

This is the ﬁrst systematic investigation of muonic X rays in this density region, and the ﬁrst one which gives
intensities for the three lowest muonic K lines. Earlier experiments [30–34] were either rather inaccurate or performed
at very low gas densities (< 10−3 x LHD) only.

Our measurements were carried out with the high intensity muon beam of the µE4 area at PSI (Paul Scherrer
Institut, Villigen, Switzerland). Figure 1 shows the setup for the measurements at liquid hydrogen density. Several
diﬀerent silver-coated steel or aluminum target cells were optimized for the measurements in liquid and gaseous
hydrogen, respectively [35].

To minimize X-ray absorption, Kapton windows with a thickness of 12.5 µm were used for the measurements at
LHD. The gas target equipped with 25 µm thick windows had to withstand pressures of up to 6 bar at temperatures
around 30 K. For safety reasons, the target vacuum vessel was separated from the CCD’s vacuum with an additional
12.5 µm Kapton window. The target cells were partly covered with superinsulation to reduce radiation heating.

FIG. 1. Top view of the setup of this experiment. The displayed target cell was used for the measurements in liquid
hydrogen. Two separated vacuum vessels were used; one for the target (V1), and one for the CCD-detector (V2). To ensure
an optimal stopping eﬃciency the scintillation counters 3 and 3a were used to register incoming muons. The electron counter
served to detect muon decay electrons. Larger target cells, adapted to the expected extent of the muon stopping distributions,
were used for the measurements in gaseous hydrogen [35].

To avoid high Z impurities in the target, which would change the K line intensities through excited-state muon
transfer [36,19], the hydrogen was cleaned during the ﬁlling procedure by using a liquid-nitrogen trap together with a
palladium ﬁlter. The composition of the hydrogen was checked online during the measurements by using a quadrupole
mass spectrometer [37] which could extract samples via a small capillary leading directly into the target volume. The
stability of the target pressure and temperature was monitored and controlled during all measurements.

Charge coupled devices (CCDs) [38,39] have been employed as X-ray detectors. They consisted of two CCD sensors§
with an active detection area of ∼ 25 x 17 mm2(∼ 880000 pixels) for each chip. The main chip component was silicon
with small absorption layers of SiO2 and Si3N4 on the surface. The depletion thickness of ∼ 30 µm was well adapted
for the observed energy region. To shorten the readout time, each chip was split into two electronically independent
detection areas.

FIG. 2. Muonic X-ray energy spectra in hydrogen observed with a CCD-detector at temperatures of ∼ 30 K and various
target densities Φ (given in units of LHD): a) Φ = 0.97, b) Φ = 0.0795, c) Φ = 0.0391, d) Φ = 0.0106, e) Φ = 0.00115. Kα, Kβ
and Kγ lines could be separated. The energy resolution of the detector ∆EFWHM/E at 2 keV was 6 %. The solid lines indicate
Gaussian ﬁts. The density dependence of the line intensities is clearly visible. The X-ray peak at 1.74 keV (dashed line) is due
to ﬂuorescence excitation of the detector’s silicon material. The low counting statistics in measurement e) reﬂects the already
very low stopping probability of muons in such a low-density hydrogen gas.

We were able to apply a speciﬁc pattern recognition algorithm to separate “true” X-ray hits from charged particles
and cosmic background using a “single pixel” selection criterion [40–42]. A “single pixel” was considered to be a
“true” X ray if the charge content of the surrounding eight neighbor pixels was statistically compatible with the noise
peak of the CCDs.

Data runs lasted for three minutes to guarantee that not more than ∼ 15 % of the CCD’s pixel were hit. A longer
exposure time would have caused a decrease in the detection eﬃciency. A fraction of hit pixels of more than 30 %
actually would have made it impossible to apply our selection criterion for X rays.

Our measurements investigated a density region covering three orders of magnitude. The observed raw energy
spectra are displayed in ﬁg.2. The intensity variation of the muonic hydrogen Kα, Kβ and Kγ lines with target
density can be seen directly. No K lines higher than Kγ could be observed.

FIG. 3. The density dependence of the relative yield of muonic K lines in hydrogen. The measured relative yield is given as
the number of counts in one K line (Ki, i=α, β, γ) divided by the total count rate in all observed K lines (Ktot=Kα+Kβ+Kγ).
The plotted data points at LHD include a 5 % correction for non-radiative ground state transitions [7]. Filled circles, squares
and triangles indicate the relative yield for Kα, Kβ and Kγ transitions, respectively. The other experimental points for Kα
yields are taken from Refs. [30](cross), [31](open circle), [32](star) and [33] (square). The displayed calculated results from [8]
used a scaling factor k for the Coulomb deexcitation cross section; k = 0 (dashed line), k = 0.5 (dotted line) and k = 1 (full
line).

An empty target run and a µ+ run proved that there were no background peaks visible within the relevant energy
region. The X-ray peak at 1.74 keV is due to ﬂuorescence excitation of the detector’s silicon material. Therefore
the background function could be approximated by the sum of a constant and a term depending linearly on energy.
Gaussians with energy-dependent width [35,40] were used to ﬁt the peak areas.

The knowledge of the X-ray detection eﬃciency was indispensable for a correct analysis. A Monte Carlo program
was written [35] to correctly account for the various contributions to X-ray absorption. The geometry of the diﬀerent
target cells, the absorption in the windows and in the CCDs’ top layers was simulated. The intrinsic detection
eﬃciency of the CCDs and the absorption in the Kapton foils were measured experimentally [35].

Figure 3 displays our results, given in Tab.I for the relative X-ray yields of the muonic hydrogen 2 → 1, 3 → 1 and
4 → 1 transitions. The relative yield is given by the intensity of one speciﬁc K line (Ki, i=α, β, γ) divided by the
intensity of all observed K lines (Ktot = Pi Ki). The plotted data at LHD include a 5 % correction for non-radiative
ground state transfer according to [7]. This is the ﬁrst measurement which allows us to test the existing cascade
calculations at high target densities [5,7–9]. The calculations taken from [8] shown in ﬁg.3 and ﬁg.4 were done for
diﬀerent contributions of Coulomb deexcitation. The corresponding cross sections [11] were scaled with a factor k
= 0 (no contribution / dashed line), k = 0.5 (dotted line) and k = 1 (full line). The calculation according to the
standard cascade model [5,9] coincides with the k = 0 assumption. The displayed data – error bars include statistical
errors and contributions due to eﬃciency corrections – match quite well the calculated density dependence. Though
not very sensitive to k within the experimental errors, the yield measurements favor values of k ≈ 1.

FIG. 4.

a) The density dependence of the Kα/Kβ ratio in muonic hydrogen. The theoretical curves are calculated as in

ﬁg.3. b) displays the magniﬁed low density region.

Theory [8] predicts that in the observed density region the density dependence of the Kα/Kβ ratio is approximately
linear, with a signiﬁcant contribution from Coulomb deexcitation. Figure 4 displays our results (Tab.I) together with
the calculation from [8]. The Kα/Kβ value at LHD favors a scaling factor k < 0.5.

Although our measurements indicate that Coulomb deexcitation plays a signiﬁcant role during the muonic cascade

an unambiguous decision on the correct value of the scaling factor k is not yet possible.

The calculation of the relative line yields already seems to be quite reliable. However, the slight disagreement at 8 %
of LHD could be an indication for a more complex density dependence of the collisional processes in the high density
region; e.g. the existence of possible molecular eﬀects [43]. Using a new calculation of the Coulomb deexcitation cross
sections [15] in the cascade model could also explain the observed behavior and abolish the necessity of the scaling
factor introduced in [8].

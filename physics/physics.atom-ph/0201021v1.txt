We consider the problem of cold atomic collisions in tight traps, where the absolute scattering
length may be larger than the trap size. As long as the size of the trap ground state is larger
than a characteristic length of the van der Waals potential, the energy eigenvalues can be computed
self-consistently from the scattering amplitude for untrapped atoms. By comparing with the exact
numerical eigenvalues of the trapping plus interatomic potentials, we verify that our model gives
accurate eigenvalues up to milliKelvin energies for single channel s-wave scattering of 23Na atoms in
an isotropic harmonic trap, even when outside the Wigner threshold regime. Our model works also
for multi-channel scattering, where the scattering length can be made large due to a magnetically
tunable Feshbach resonance.

I. INTRODUCTION

Along with the development of laser cooling of atoms
have come techniques for trapping the cold atoms, with
tremendous advantages for experimental atomic physics.
Just to name a few potent examples where trapping is
necessary, the Bose-Einstein transition has been reached
in several atomic species [1–3], threshold scattering prop-
erties have been studied [4,5], molecules formed with the
assistance of light [6], and quantum chaos [7,8] and quan-
tum phase transitions [9] observed using optical lattices.
a

Atomic collisions play an essential role in most of these
phenomena. In the past one could ignore the fact that
these collisions take place in a trap, since trap sizes
are very large in comparison with the sizes associated
with atomic interactions. However, recent developments
make it crucial to account for the eﬀect of trap conﬁne-
ment on collisions when the atoms are held tightly in
one, two, or three dimensions by optical lattices. For
example, Greiner et al. [9] have observed a quantum
phase transition from a superﬂuid to a Mott insula-
tor within a three-dimensional optical lattice. More-
over, several low-dimensional phase transitions of cold
bosonic systems have been conjectured. In two dimen-
sions, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition may occur [10],
while in one dimension the Tonks-Girardeau phase should
be possible [11,12]. Zero-temperature transitions have
also been investigated theoretically for a rotating two di-
mensional gas [13]. All of these transitions depend on
atomic collisions, and for quantitative predictions the
low-dimensional interactions must be understood.

Two proposals for quantum computing involve loading
cold atoms into optical lattices, and using the interaction
between the atoms as the switching mechanism [14,15].
In one type of quantum logic gate, two atoms are brought
together and allowed to interact for a set time interval,
resulting in diﬀerent phase shifts depending on their hy-

1

perﬁne sublevels. A recent experiment [9] represents an
important ﬁrst step towards quantum logic applications,
since it shows that a lattice can be initialized with uni-
form occupancy of lattice sites.

Another burgeoning area is the study of Feshbach res-
onances, and weakly-bound molecular states, in the in-
teraction of two ultra-cold atoms. This has improved the
knowledge of interaction parameters of alkali atoms and
opened up the ﬁeld of molecular condensates and 3-body
processes [16,18]. By tuning Feshbach resonances one can
easily reach an interesting regime where the scale length
associated with the scattered wave exceeds the trap width
[19].

We address these problems by calculating the eigen-
values of two interacting atoms conﬁned in a trapping
potential. A popular method for representing cold atom
interactions is to replace the exact interatomic potential
by a delta-function pseudopotential proportional to the
scattering length a:

ˆV =

4π¯h2
m

aδ(r)

∂
∂r

r,

(1)

where m is the atomic mass and r is the interatomic sep-
aration. An analytic solution for the eigenvalues of two
atoms in an isotropic harmonic trap plus the pseudopo-
tential Eq. (1) has been found [20]. However, some of us
have previously shown that the use of this solution is lim-
ited to suﬃciently weak traps such that the trap width is
much larger than
[19]. Here we reexamine this prob-
lem and propose a self-consistent method of calculating
the trap energies, which gives good quantitative results
over a wide range of trap frequencies, even when
is
larger than the trap size. The essence of our model is
to replace a with an energy-dependent eﬀective scatter-
ing length. An advantage of our model is that once the
energy-dependent scattering phase shift for a particular
type of cold collision is known, either from experiment

or from close-coupling calculations, it can be easily ap-
plied to obtain eigenvalues for traps of all frequencies.
Conversely, if the eigenvalues are measured, information
about collisions can be obtained.

We note that the pseudopotential can be used to ob-
tain approximate solutions for trapped colliding atoms in
one dimension [21,11] and two dimensions [22]. It may
be possible to adapt our self-consistent method to accu-
rately treat scattering in “cigar-” or “pancake-” shaped
traps.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we for-
mulate the problem of atoms colliding in a tight spher-
ical trap, and brieﬂy review scattering theory.
In Sec.
III we motivate and explain the self-consistent eigen-
value model, which is our main result. Limitations of
the model are discussed. Section IV applies the model
to single-channel scattering of 23Na atoms in a trap, and
shows good agreement with numerical calculations using
the full interaction Hamiltonian. Section V demonstrates
similar good agreement for the case of multi-channel scat-
tering. Speciﬁcally, we consider a magnetically-induced
Feshbach resonance in Na2. We compare, for a range
of magnetic ﬁelds, exact numerical results from the ﬁve-
channel close-coupled scattering problem with the self-
consistent eigenvalues. Finally, in Sec. VI we draw con-
clusions and consider more general traps and applications
to many-body theory.

II. TWO ATOMS COLLIDING IN AN
ISOTROPIC HARMONIC TRAP

We consider an isotropic harmonic trap described for

mω2r2
j ,

Vtrap(rj) =

atom j = 1, 2 at position rj by
1
2
where ω is the trapping frequency. Harmonic traps can
be made by a variety of means. Very tight conﬁnement
is possible with a three-dimensional optical lattice. Typ-
ical experimental trap frequencies range from 50 kHz to
1 MHz. These optical dipole traps are much tighter than
those obtained with magnetic ﬁelds. In a recent experi-
ment [9], isotropic potentials at each site were produced
from three optical standing waves of equal intensity.

(2)

For the isotropic harmonic trap, the two-atom Hamil-
tonian is separable in the center-of-mass and relative co-
ordinates. Since the center-of-mass motion is just that
of the well-known isotropic harmonic oscillator, we need
only discuss the problem in the relative coordinates. The
Hamiltonian is

where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . is the radial quantum number and

henceforth consider only s-waves (L = 0). The size of

Typical trap sizes l for Na in the above mentioned trap

The interatomic potential Vint(r) is characterized by
a short-range region of strong chemical bonding and a
long-range van der Waals potential,

and leads to a van der Waals scale length, [5,23,24]

For r

due to the strong interaction potential. In alkali ground

of a given atomic pair; consequently, x0 is the same for all
collision channels. In the case of Na2 considered below,
it is about 2.4 nm.

On the other hand, the scattering length can have a larger
magnitude than the trap width l. This is especially likely
if the scattering length is modiﬁed by means of a Fesh-
bach resonance.

Our goal is to ﬁnd a simple model for calculating the
new energy eigenvalues of the trap when collisions are
present. An analytical solution of this problem was pre-
sented in Ref. [20] by replacing Vint by the pseudopo-
tential of Eq. (1). This replacement assumes that the
Wigner law is valid. However, we previously showed that
the eigenvalues thus obtained are not always in agree-
ment with numerical results [19]! Speciﬁcally, they are
least accurate when
approaches or exceeds l. One way
to see this is that the energies of the unperturbed trap
states are already large enough that the Wigner thresh-
old law is invalid. For the unperturbed trap ground state
E = 3¯hω/2 and hence the root-mean-square momentum
k = √3/l. Therefore by Eq. (10) we are outside of the

In the next section we will use the inequality Eq. (11)
to motivate a self-consistent model of cold collisions in
the trap, that is valid at all relevant energies and scat-
tering lengths.

III. SELF-CONSISTENT MODEL

The improved model we propose relies on a general-
ization of the pseudopotential approximation for Vint in
Eq. (1). We introduce the energy-dependent pseudopo-
tential operator [25]

ˆVeﬀ =

4π¯h2

aeﬀ(E)δ(r)

∂
∂r

r,

where the eﬀective scattering length is deﬁned as

aeﬀ(E) =

tan δ0(k)
k

.

−

and the kinetic energy is related to the momentum by
E = ¯h2k2/2µ. This operator gives the same asymptotic
wavefunction, Eq. (8), as the full interaction potential
Vint. The eﬀective scattering length reduces to the usual
one, Eq. (9), in the Wigner threshold regime. The phase
shift in Eq. (13) does not need to be small in order to
use Eq. (12). Even though the eﬀective scattering length
diverges when δ0 is an odd multiple of π/2, the wave-
function remains well-behaved.

Reference [20] found the eigenvalues of the trapped
atoms interacting through the operator in Eq. (1) as the
solutions of the equation,

and Γ is the gamma function. To account properly for the
scattering in tight traps, where the Wigner law may not
apply at the trap energies, we need to replace Eq. (14)
by one in which the left-hand side is energy-dependent
and solve the equation

(15)

aeﬀ(E)
l

= f (E)

(16)

self-consistently for the eigenvalues.

One might ask, why does the idea of the pseudopo-
tential still work outside the regime of the Wigner law?
The answer is that the collision occurs on the very short
length scale x0, so the interatomic interaction potential
is undistorted by the trap. This in turn means that the
kinetic energy at which the eﬀective scattering length
needs to be evaluated is the eigenvalue itself, since the
trap potential is negligible for r < x0. Thus we were led
to the self-consistent Eq. (16).

This model can be expected to break down if the trap
becomes too tight. The interatomic potential Vint be-
comes comparable to the trap potential near r = √lx0.
Hence the inner part of the wavefunction where the scat-
tering occurs is nearly the same as that without the trap
when x0 <
√lx0, equivalent to Eq. (11). A diﬀerent kind
∼
of limitation is that this model cannot predict bound
states without our knowing the analytical continuation
of the eﬀective scattering length to negative energies.

IV. SINGLE-CHANNEL SCATTERING

The ﬁrst problem we consider is that of doubly polar-
ized (electron and nuclear spin up) 23Na atoms colliding
in the trap. In this case, there is only one scattering chan-
nel, governed by the a3Σ+
u adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer
potential. The scattering length is a = 3.2 nm, and Figs.
1 and 2 show the eﬀective scattering length as a function
It increases with energy and diverges near
of energy.
E/h = 90 MHz where δ0 = π/2 (this corresponds to a
local maximum of the s-wave cross section), and is neg-
ative immediately above this energy. In this work both
the single- and multi-channel phase shifts are calculated
by applying the Gordon propagation method [26] with
the best available scattering potentials for Na2 [27].

The radial Schr¨odinger equation for the Hamiltonian
Eq. (3) was solved numerically for the eigenvalues. For
a detailed description of our numerical method using a
discrete variable representation, see Ref. [28]. We take
a trap frequency of ω/2π = 1 MHz, for which l = 29.6
nm and ¯hω/kB = 48 µK (kB is the Boltzmann constant).
Such a tight trap should be feasible in a Na optical lat-
tice.

We illustrate the graphical solution of

the self-
consistent model in Figs. 1 and 2. In each plot, the solid

(14)

curve represents the left hand side of Eq. (16), aeﬀ/l,
while the dashed curve is the right hand side. The ab-
scissae of the points where the curves intersect give the
self-consistent eigenvalues according to the model. One
way of comparing with the exact numerical eigenvalues
is to evaluate the intercept function f (E) at these eigen-
values; these points are plotted as circles. The closer
the circles lie to the intersection of the curves, the better
the agreement. The exact numerical and model eigenval-
ues in Fig. 1 agree to better than 0.0016 ¯hω. Note that
the solution of Eq. (14) is found from the intersection of
f (E) and the horizontal line E = a/l; the corresponding
eigenvalues diﬀer signiﬁcantly from both the exact and
self-consistent ones.

values along the curve of the intercept function.

The range of energies in Fig. 2 is centered near the en-
ergy at which aeﬀ/l diverges. Even though
l, the
self-consistent eigenvalues are still accurate. They agree
with the exact ones to within 0.0018 ¯hω. Clearly this val-
idates our model. We have also obtained eigenvalues for
much higher trap frequencies, at which distortion of the
collision potential is expected to cause the self-consistent
model to fail. At a trapping frequency 100 MHz, where
l = 2.96 nm
x0 , the error between the exact eigen-
values and those obtained from our model has increased
to 0.045 ¯hω. The crucial interaction length scale for com-
parison to the trap size l is x0, not the eﬀective scattering
length aeﬀ.

FIG. 2. Same as Fig. 1 but at a higher energy range.
Note that the eﬀective scattering length diverges, but the
self-consistent eigenvalues still agree with the exact numer-
ical eigenvalues.

The diﬀerence between the lowest seven eigenvalues
and the corresponding harmonic oscillator eigenvalues
given by Eq. (4) is plotted in Fig. 3 versus the quantum
number n. The shift due to the interactions is a signif-
icant fraction of ¯hω and should be observable in appro-
priate experiments. The dependence of the shift on the
index for the lowest few eigenvalues is due mainly to the
energy dependence of the gamma functions in Eq. (15),
and only slightly due to the variation of the eﬀective scat-
tering length with energy. On the other hand, for the
higher eigenvalues in Fig. 2, the shifts in eigenvalues
arise mostly from the rapid variation of eﬀective scatter-
ing length with energy. Near the asymptote aeﬀ → ∞
the eigenvalues have increased by approximately ¯hω com-
pared with the unperturbed values.

The above examples show that accurate eigenvalues
can be obtained by using results of the single-channel
scattering problem (without the trap), and solving the
self-consistent Eq. (16). Our self-consistent model is good
even when the eﬀective scattering length is large com-
pared to the trap width, provided the trap size is still
larger than the van der Waals length scale.

V. MULTI-CHANNEL SCATTERING AND
FESHBACH RESONANCE

In the previous Section, large ratios of eﬀective scatter-
ing length to trap width were only possible for very high-
lying levels. Here we want to discuss a situation where
/l is arbitrarily large for the lowest trap levels. This
aeﬀ|

can be experimentally realized for s-wave collisions using
a magnetically-tuned Feshbach resonance.

a numerical close coupled scattering calculation with ﬁve
channels. This enables us to extract the position of the

We now examine the eﬀect of the Feshbach resonance
on trap eigenstates, assuming a trap with ω/2π = 500
kHz. We used the numerical discrete variable method
for ﬁve channels to calculate the lowest eigenvalues of the
trap states for a range of magnetic ﬁelds near the reso-
nance. These eigenvalues are plotted as circles in Fig. 4.
Solutions to the self-consistent eigenvalues were obtained
by solving Eq. (16) graphically as in the single-channel
case; the solutions versus magnetic ﬁeld are the solid
curves. The self-consistent eigenvalues agree well with

(17)

the numerical ones for all values of energy and magnetic
ﬁeld; the worst agreement, < 0.1¯hω, is for eigenvalues
near the resonance position. The self-consistent eigen-
values always lie slightly above the numerical ones. Note
that the self-consistent eigenvalues cross the Ediv curve
near E/¯hω = 1/2, 5/2, 9/2 . . . Another particular feature
of the plot, which is correctly reproduced by the numer-
ical solution, is that as B decreases the lowest trap state
(E > 0) becomes the highest bound state (E < 0) for
a magnetic ﬁeld B < Bres. This occurs where the ef-
fective scattering length is still ﬁnite and positive, since

VI. CONCLUSION

We have shown how a self-consistent model can be used
to calculate the eigenvalues of interacting atoms in an
isotropic harmonic trap. Our model involves solving an
equation containing the eﬀective scattering length for un-
trapped atoms, and the trap frequency. We compared our
model with exact results for 23Na both for a single chan-
nel collision and a multi-channel collision with a tunable
Feshbach resonance. In both cases, the model can accu-
rately treat tight traps, as long as the trap size is larger
than the van der Waals scale length. Consequently we
expect the model to apply to other atomic species. In
particular, Cs would be an interesting case for which the
scattering length is large in comparison with even modest
trap sizes [32].

In the future, we want to generalize the self-consistent
model to more arbitrary trap potentials. There are two
technical problems to be overcome. First, for atomic col-
lisions in anisotropic harmonic traps, the relative coordi-
nate equation does not separate; this implies that diﬀer-
ent partial waves are coupled via the anisotropy. A re-
lated point is that the scattering of higher partial waves
can also be modeled by pseudopotentials [25]. Second, for
anharmonic traps, the center-of-mass and relative atomic
coordinates do not separate, and even more coordinates
must be treated simultaneously. Anharmonic terms be-
come important for low intensity optical lattices or for
trap levels with many quanta of excitation.

One would expect to be able to use the eﬀective scat-
tering length in many-body problems, where the pseu-
dopotential approximation has had widespread use. One
would simply need to replace a by the eﬀective scattering
length. This should be especially useful and necessary for
situations where a tunable Feshbach resonance is used to
alter the interaction properties. There are a number of
cases where the relative collision energy for a many-body
system is well-deﬁned, such as for condensates in optical
lattices [9], colliding condensates [33,34], or cold gases
of mixed fermionic species, where collisions occur at the
Fermi energy. It should also be possible to incorporate
inelastic collision loss channels by using a complex eﬀec-
tive scattering length [33].

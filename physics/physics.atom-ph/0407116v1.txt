A pulsed beam of ground state OH radicals is slowed down using a Stark decelerator and is
subsequently loaded into an electrostatic trap. Characterization of the molecular beam production,
deceleration and trap loading process is performed via laser induced ﬂuorescence detection inside the
quadrupole trap. Depending on details of the trap loading sequence, typically 105 OH (X 2Π3/2, J =
−3 and at temperatures in the 50-500 mK
3/2) radicals are trapped at a density of around 107 cm
range. The 1/e trap lifetime is around 1.0 second.

Getting ever better control over both the internal and
external degrees of freedom of gas-phase molecules has
been an important theme in molecular physics during
the last decades. This control is important, for instance,
in spectroscopic investigations, in collision and reactive
scattering experiments and in photo-dissociation, or half-
collision, studies. Seeded molecular beams, both contin-
uous and pulsed, have been extensively used to produce
samples of molecules in only the lowest internal energy
states, with typical rotational temperatures of a few K
[1]. In these molecular beams the longitudinal velocity
distribution is also well deﬁned, and translational tem-
peratures of around 1 K are obtained in the moving
frame of the molecular beam. Further control over the
molecules is achieved when their orientation in space is
actively manipulated, using either static electro-magnetic
ﬁelds and/or radiation ﬁelds [2]. Sophisticated and pow-
erful detection schemes have been developed to experi-
mentally study (half-) collisions [3, 4] and reactions [5] of
the thus prepared molecules in the required detail.

Over the last years our group has been developing
methods to get improved control over the absolute veloc-
ity and over the velocity spread of molecules in a molecu-
lar beam [6]. These methods rely on the, quantum-state
speciﬁc, force that polar molecules experience in electric
ﬁelds. This force is rather weak, typically some eight to
ten orders of magnitude weaker than the force that the
corresponding molecular ion experiences in the same elec-
tric ﬁeld. This force nevertheless suﬃces to achieve com-
plete control over the motion of polar molecules, using
techniques akin to those used for the control of charged
particles. We have explicitly demonstrated this by the
construction of two types of linear accelerators [7], a
buncher [8], a trap [9] and a storage ring [10] for neutral
polar molecules. Using these tools, state-selected molec-
ular beams with a computer-controlled absolute veloc-
ity and with record-low (longitudinal) temperatures have
been produced. This holds great promise for the use of
decelerated molecular beams in metrology, i.e., in exper-
iments aimed at testing fundamental symmetries [11].

To be able to exploit the possibilities that these new
tools oﬀer for collision and reactive scattering experi-
ments, the fraction of the pulsed molecular beam that is
decelerated and/or trapped needs to come closer to unity,
i.e., the 6-dimensional phase space acceptance of the var-
ious elements needs to be increased to better match to
the typical emittance of a molecular beam. In addition,
deceleration and trapping needs to be performed on those
molecules that are of most relevance in collision and reac-
tive scattering experiments; thus far, electrostatic trap-
ping after Stark deceleration has only been demonstrated
for ND3 molecules [9, 12].

We here report the deceleration and electrostatic trap-
ping of ground state OH (X 2Π3/2, J = 3/2) radicals. The
experiments are performed in a new generation molec-
ular beam deceleration machine, designed such that a
large fraction of the molecular beam pulse can be slowed
down and trapped. The role of the omnipresent OH
radical as intermediate in many chemical reactions has
made this a benchmark molecule in collision and reactive
scattering studies. Hexapole state-selection and focus-
ing, e.g., transverse phase space manipulation, of a beam
of OH is well documented and often used in these stud-
ies [13]. The possibility to manipulate the longitudinal
phase-space distribution of OH radicals inside a deceler-
ator has recently been demonstrated as well [14].

The experimental setup is schematically shown in
Fig. 1. A pulsed beam of OH with a mean velocity of
460 m/s and with a velocity spread of 15 % (full width
half maximum, FWHM) is produced via ArF-laser disso-
ciation of HNO3 seeded in Kr near the oriﬁce of a pulsed
valve. Production thus takes place at a well-deﬁned time
and at a well-deﬁned position, which is ideal for coupling
the molecular beam into the decelerator. More than 95 %
of the OH radicals in the beam reside in the lowest ro-
tational and vibrational level of the X 2Π3/2 spin-orbit
manifold of the electronic ground state. This popula-
tion is distributed over the two Λ-doublet components
of the J = 3/2 level, which has a zero-ﬁeld splitting of
0.055 cm−1. Only OH radicals in low-ﬁeld seeking quan-

After passage through a 2 mm diameter skimmer, the
molecular beam enters the deceleration chamber and is
focussed into the Stark decelerator by a short hexapole.
The hexapole matches the transverse phase space distri-
bution of the OH (J = 3/2,
= 9/4) radicals at
the entrance of the decelerator to the transverse accep-
tance of the decelerator. A detailed description of the
operation principle of a Stark decelerator and an elec-
trostatic quadrupole trap, as well as of (the importance
of) phase-space matching between the various elements
in the molecular decelerator beam-line is given elsewhere
[12]. In the current design the dimensions of the decel-
erator are scaled up by a factor of two relative to ear-
lier designs. With the electric ﬁeld stages in the decel-
erator now at a distance of 11 mm, and with a 4
4
mm2 transverse acceptance area between the two 6 mm
diameter parallel electrodes that make up one electric
ﬁeld stage, the total spatial acceptance of the decelera-
tor has been increased by a factor eight. This upscaling
has been performed while maintaining the same electric
ﬁeld strength inside the decelerator; in the present ex-

periments a voltage diﬀerence of 40 kV is switched on
and oﬀ in an electric ﬁeld stage. The area within the
outer contour in the upper left corner in Fig. 1 is the
thus obtained longitudinal acceptance of the decelerator
for phase-stable transport of OH (J = 3/2,
= 9/4)
without deceleration. With a distance from the source to
the decelerator of only about 10 cm, this longitudinal ac-
ceptance largely encompasses the longitudinal emittance
of the pulsed OH beam, indicated by the shaded area.
When operating the decelerator at φ0 = 0◦ for a syn-
chronous molecule with a velocity of 450 m/s, a time of
ﬂight (TOF) proﬁle of the OH (J = 3/2) radicals exiting
the decelerator as shown in the lower right corner of Fig. 1
is observed. The main portion of the OH beam is trans-
ported through the machine as a compact package (less
than 25 µs FWHM in the TOF proﬁle), independent of
the length of the decelerator. The TOF proﬁle resulting
from a three-dimensional trajectory calculation, shown
underneath the measurement, quantitatively reproduces
the observation. From the calculations, the contributions
of the individual
components to the TOF proﬁle
can be identiﬁed. In addition, these calculations enable
a detailed understanding of the untrapped dynamics in
the decelerator, which manifests itself by the features in
the wings of the observed TOF proﬁle.

For deceleration of the molecular beam, operation at a
phase angle 0◦ < φ0 <90◦ is required. As the longitudi-
nal acceptance of the decelerator rapidly decreases with
increasing phase angle it is often advantageous to oper-
ate the decelerator at a relatively low phase angle, i.e., to
extract a smaller amount of energy from the molecular
beam per deceleration stage, and to use more decelera-
tion stages instead. The decelerator used in the current
experiment consists out of 108 deceleration stages, and
has a length of 1188 mm. The large number of decel-
eration stages also enables the deceleration of molecular
beams with a higher initial velocity; in the present exper-
iment this enables the use of Kr for seeding instead of Xe,
which reduces cluster formation in the expansion. In ex-
periments that we have performed to produce decelerated
beams of metastable NH radicals, it was unfavorable to
use Xe as a carrier gas as it eﬃciently quenches the elec-
tronically excited species. Only by performing 266 nm
dissociation of HN3 seeded in Kr a suﬃciently intense
beam of NH (a1∆, J = 2) radicals could be produced,
which we have subsequently decelerated from 550 m/s to
330 m/s (data not shown).

The electrostatic trap consists of a ring electrode, cen-
tered 21 mm downstream from the last electrodes of the
decelerator, with an inner radius R of 10 mm and two
hyperbolic end-caps with a half-spacing of R/√2. This
trap is scaled up by a factor two compared to the trap
that we have used thus far [12]. The molecular beam en-
ters the trap through a 4 mm diameter hole in the ﬁrst
end-cap. This hole is the only vacuum connection be-
tween the deceleration chamber and the trap chamber,

from the laser is largely avoided by using light baﬄes and
is suppressed by optical ﬁltering in front of the PMT.

In Fig. 2 the intensity of the LIF signal of OH (J =
3/2) radicals at the center of the trap is shown as a
function of time after ﬁring the dissociation laser, us-
ing diﬀerent deceleration and trap loading sequences. In
the measurement shown in the upper curve, the deceler-
ator is operated at a phase angle of φ0 = 50◦, extracting
about 0.9 cm−1 of kinetic energy from the synchronous
molecule in every deceleration stage; OH radicals with
an initial velocity of around 465 m/s are decelerated to a
ﬁnal velocity of around 305 m/s. Due to a better spatial
conﬁnement, the peak density of the decelerated portion
of the molecular beam is higher than the peak density of
the non-decelerated beam that passes through the trap.

The hole in the TOF proﬁle of the fast beam due to the
disappearance of OH radicals that are decelerated is in-
dicated by an arrow. In the measurement shown in the
middle curve, OH radicals with an initial velocity around
440 m/s are decelerated to 170 m/s, operating the decel-
erator at a phase angle of φ0 = 70◦. In the lower curve,
the observed TOF proﬁle is shown when the decelera-
tor operates at φ0 = 77◦, extracting about 1.2 cm−1 of
kinetic energy per deceleration stage. OH radicals with
an initial velocity of 428 m/s (Ekin = 130 cm−1) exit
the decelerator with a velocity of around 21 m/s. The
OH radicals in the non-decelerated part of the beam also
experience the switched electric ﬁelds inside the decel-
erator. This leads to a highly structured phase-space
distribution and results in rich oscillatory structure on
the TOF proﬁle of the fast beam, as shown enlarged in
the ﬁgure. The slow beam of OH radicals is loaded into
the electrostatic trap with voltages of 7 kV, 15 kV and
-15 kV on the ﬁrst end-cap, the ring electrode and the sec-
ond end-cap, respectively. This creates a potential hill in
the trap that is higher than the remaining kinetic energy
of the molecules. The OH radicals therefore come to a
standstill near the center of the trap, around 7.4 ms after
their production. At that time, indicated by an arrow in
Fig. 2, the ﬁrst end-cap is switched from 7 kV to -15 kV
to create a (nearly) symmetric 500 mK deep potential
well. After some initial oscillations, a steady LIF signal
is observed from the OH radicals in the trap. The LIF
intensity of the trapped OH radicals is about 20 % of the
peak LIF intensity of the non-decelerated beam of OH
that passes through the trap. The observed LIF signal of
the trapped OH radicals corresponds to a total number
of about 105 OH (J = 3/2,
= 9/4) radicals, in the

approximately 0.03 cm3 detection volume in the trap. In
the inset, the LIF signal intensity is shown on a longer
time-scale, from which a 1/e trap lifetime on the order of
1.0 second, limited by collisions with background gas, is
deduced.

The absolute number of OH radicals that can be
trapped as well as the phase space distribution of the
trapped molecules critically depends on the details of
the trap loading sequence. In Fig. 3 measurements are
shown for two slightly diﬀerent trap loading conditions,
referred to as case A and case B. Curve A(i) and B(i)
show the TOF proﬁle of the slow beam of OH radicals
that passes through the trap when no voltages are applied
to the trap electrodes. Due to the lower beam velocity
of around 15 m/s in case B compared to the 21 m/s in
case A, the beam arrives later at the center of the trap,
is spread out more and has a lower peak density. Curve

ing and the reﬂected beam. In case B the molecules are
reﬂected almost exactly at the center of the trap. Curve
A(iii) (identical to the lower curve in Fig. 2) and B(iii)
show the resulting TOF proﬁle when we switch from the
loading geometry to the trapping geometry at the time
indicated by the arrow. The higher initial velocity in case
A leads to approximately a factor three more molecules
in the trap, but also results in clear oscillations in the
TOF proﬁle. When the molecules are (more) correctly
coupled into the trap, as in case B, hardly any oscilla-
tions are observed. The simulations underneath the ex-
perimental data accurately reproduce the observed TOF
proﬁles. The calculated longitudinal phase space distri-
bution of the molecules in the trap at t = 30 ms, shown
in Fig. 3 for both cases, should therefore also be realis-
tic. From this, the FWHM of the velocity distribution of
the trapped molecules is deduced to be around 30 m/s
in case A and around 10 m/s in case B, corresponding
to a temperature of 450 mK and 50 mK for the trapped
OH radicals, respectively. The density is rather similar
in both cases, and is about 107 cm−3.

The samples of electrostatically trapped OH radicals
produced here, are, for instance, ideally suited to inves-
tigate the predicted linking of ultracold polar molecules
[15]. The experiments reported here are performed in

a molecular beam deceleration and trapping machine
that is designed such that almost the complete molec-
ular beam pulse that passes through the skimmer in the
right quantum-state can be transported through the trap
at a tunable absolute velocity while staying together as
a compact package. Alternatively, a sizeable fraction of
this molecular beam pulse can be slowed down to a near
standstill and loaded into the electrostatic trap, where
the molecules can then be trapped up to seconds. Sensi-
tive quantum-state speciﬁc detection of the molecules can
be performed inside the quadrupole trap. As the molec-
ular beam machine typically runs at a 10 Hz repetition
rate, and as diﬀerent high voltage switching sequences
can be applied to adjacent molecular beam pulses, this to-
gether oﬀers the unique possibility to perform ”in-beam”
collision and reactive scattering experiments as a function
of the continuously tunable collision energy and with an
unprecedented energy resolution.

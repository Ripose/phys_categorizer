We present our progress towards a new measurement of the electron
electric dipole moment using a beam of YbF molecules. Data are cur-
rently being taken with a sensitivity of 10−27e.cm/√day.

1. Motivation and historical perspective

7.4)

The most precise electric dipole moment (edm) measurement1 on the elec-
10−28 e.cm. Although the Standard Model
tron gives de = (6.9
predicts a far smaller value, many modern extensions of particle theory
lead quite naturally to a value in the range of 10−27 e.cm or a little below2.
Our experiment, which aims to be more sensitive than this, is therefore a
search for new physics. An edm at this level would also demonstrate a new
type of CP violation, beyond the usual CKM mechanism, as is required to
understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe3.

The interaction between de and an applied ﬁeld E can be expressed by
E. For a free electron,
the eﬀective non-relativistic Hamiltonian
α(E) = 1 and ˆσ is a unit vector along the spin. If the electron is part of an
atom or molecule, ˆσ lies along the spin of the system and α(E) is a factor
that depends on the structure. Some heavy atoms and molecules have the
1, and then it is called the enhancement factor4. This
virtue that α(E)

coupling resembles the interaction
with a magnetic ﬁeld B, where β(B) accounts for the atomic or molecular
structure. It is instructive to compare these two interactions in the case of a
10−28 e.cm, just below the present
free electron with an edm of, say, de = 5

limit. In a 100 kV/cm ﬁeld the edm energy is so small that it equals the

the electric ﬁeld. Heavy atoms such as Cs and Tl alleviate this problem

by their large enhancement factors. In particular, α(E) =
thallium atom5, which relaxes the necessary ﬁeld control to the challeng-
ing, but achievable fT level. Two magnetic eﬀects are most troublesome.
(i) Stray magnetic ﬁelds vary both in space and time. (ii) Atoms moving
through the large electric ﬁeld experience a motional magnetic interaction6

2. Measuring with molecules
Heavy polar molecules oﬀer substantial relief from these diﬃculties7. First,
the enhancement factors are generically much larger8 because the electron

In an atom this polarisation follows from the mixing of higher

electronic states by the applied electric ﬁeld.
In a polar molecule, these
electronic states are already strongly mixed by the chemical bond and it
is only rotational states that have to be mixed by the applied ﬁeld. Since
these are typically a thousand times closer in energy, the molecular en-
hancement factor is larger. For the YbF molecule used in our experiment,
106 at our operating ﬁeld of 13 kV/cm,
the enhancement factor9 is α
≃
which relaxes the requirement on ﬁeld control to the pT level.

There is a second advantage to YbFa. Being polar, this molecule has
a strong tensor Stark splitting between the Zeeman sublevels, making the
applied electric ﬁeld the natural quantization axis. As a result, the Zeeman
shift associated with a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld is strongly suppressed,
making the molecule insensitive to the motional ﬁeld. For our typical op-
erating parameters the motion-induced false edm is10 below 10−33 e.cm,
which is entirely negligible.

as unwanted phase shifts can occur if the ambient ﬁelds rotate during split-
ting. When combined with other imperfections of the apparatus, such a
phase can produce a false edm and is therefore undesirable.

4.1. Radio frequency splitter

The radio frequency beam splitter is an rf magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to
E along the beam direction. This excites the F = 1 coherent superposition
with probability12

where Ω is the Rabi frequency and δ is the detuning of the rf ﬁeld from
resonance. When a pulse of molecules arrives at the centre of the rf loop we
subject it to a short rf pulse such that Ωt = π, i.e. a π-pulse, to induce 100%
population transfer at resonance. Figure 2 shows the lineshape measured
using 50 µs-long rf pulses, together with a ﬁt to eq. 1, showing quite good
agreement. However, the peak transition probability is signiﬁcantly less
than unity. This is due to the beam velocity spread, which makes the gas
pulse 5 cm long at the ﬁrst loop and 10 cm at the second. Since the rf ﬁeld
strength varies along the beam line, this spreading produces a distribution
of Rabi frequencies. The eﬀect appears more clearly as a damping of the
Rabi oscillations, shown in ﬁg. 3(a), in good agreement with the expected
damping from the known magnetic ﬁeld distribution of the rf loop. The

rival time at the detector. Contours of constant Ωt are clearly seen. At
the centre of the loop, corresponding to the dashed line (c) in ﬁg. 3(b), we
can drive more than two complete Rabi oscillations, as plotted in ﬁg. 3(c).
Figure 3(d) shows the much slower Rabi ﬂopping of late-arriving molecules
(section (d) of ﬁg. 3(b)) that experienced a weaker rf ﬁeld. The data fol-
low the expected sinusoidal Rabi-ﬂopping behaviour (lines), demonstrating
that the damping in ﬁg. 3(a) is indeed due to rf ﬁeld inhomogeneity.

We are currently working to shorten the rf pulses further so that the
molecules move even less distance during the splitting. Preliminary results
with new, higher power, rf ampliﬁers suggest that we can work with pulses
less than 10 µs long, corresponding to a beam movement below 6 mm.

4.2. Raman splitter

∼

←

The Raman beam splitter uses two co-propagating 552 nm laser beams with
a frequency diﬀerence of
170 MHz to drive the hyperﬁne transition. In
this case the spatial localisation of the light ensures that the transition
occurs in well-deﬁned static ﬁelds. An adequate hyperﬁne transition rate
is achieved by tuning the light near the A1/2
X transition. At the
same time we avoid spontaneous emission from the A1/2 state as that tends
to leave the molecule in a vibrationally or rotationally excited state. We
achieve the required detuning by Stark shifting the A1/2
X transition.
This allows us to use just one dye laser to generate the Raman beams as
well as the pump and probe light - a valuable simpliﬁcation. We apply
an electric ﬁeld of 2.7 kV/cm to detune the transition13 by ∆ = 250 MHz,
which is
10 natural linewidths. The excitation probability is then well
approximated by eq. 1 with the substitution Ω = Ω1Ω2/∆, where Ω1,2 are
the Rabi frequencies for the two laser ﬁelds. Now, δ (eq. 1) is the detuning
from two-photon resonance and t is the time of ﬂight through the cw Raman
splitter. Once again, the velocity spread of the beam makes it impossible to
give all the molecules a π-pulse. However, the spread is only some 40 m/s
FWHM on a mean velocity of 580 m/ s, allowing a transition probability of
99.7% to be achieved.

Figure 4(a) shows the Raman transition lineshape. The width of this
line is dominated by Doppler broadening from the transverse momentum
spread of the laser beams, an eﬀect that is less well controlled than we
would like in our edm measurement. In ﬁg. 4(b) we show the Rabi ﬂopping
of the transition, with the intensity held ﬁxed in one beam (the redder one)

5. Results and outlook

We are now making an electron edm measurement. Our current data set,
collected over the last two months is displayed in chronological order in
ﬁg. 5. There are 3088 measurements each of which took typically 2 minutes.
The small variations in average sensitivity are due primarily to changes in
the intensity and stability of the molecular beam and, to a lesser degree,
of the laser. In the last two weeks there is a period of sharply increased
uncertainty as we start to make checks for systematic errors.

measurement10, gains from a cold, pulsed source11 and other techni-
cal
improvements have increased the experimental sensitivity by more
than a factor of thirty so that the statistical sensitivity is approximately
10−27e.cm/√day. All the data were taken using Raman beam splitters. We
are preparing to take new data with the pulsed rf beam splitters once the
current systematic checks are complete. As a further control against any
false edm we plan to repeat the experiment using CaF molecules. These
provide a good null test as CaF is similar to YbF structurally and mag-
netically, but has
40 times less sensitivity to the electron edm according
to the expected Z 3 scaling7. We have already performed a trial run and
the results look encouraging for making a measurement in the 10−28e.cm
range in the near future. Beyond that, we plan to guide and decelerate the
beam14, to obtain an anticipated further factor of 100 in sensitivity.

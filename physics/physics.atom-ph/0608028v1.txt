The quadrupole channel of two-photon double ionization of He exhibits two distinctly diﬀerent
modes of correlated motion of the photoelectron pair. The mode associated with the center-of-
mass motion favors a large total momentum which is maximazed at a parallel emission. However,
the mode associated with the relative motion favors an antiparallel emission. This diﬀerence is
manifested in a profoundly diﬀerent width of the angular correlation functions corresponding to the
center-of-mass and relative motion modes.

The process of correlated motion of multiple ionization
fragments has been at the forefront of atomic collision
physics during the past decade. Recent progress in exper-
imental techniques made it possible to detect simultane-
ously a large number of charged reaction fragments with
fully determined kinematics [1]. The long range Coulomb
interaction between these fragments makes a full theo-
retical description of such a process a highly challenging
task. In the meantime, the simplest multiple fragmenta-
tion reaction, the single-photon double ionization (SPDI)
of helium is now well understood with accurate theoret-
ical predictions being conﬁrmed experimentally under a
wide range of kinematical conditions [2, 3, 4]. All the
information about the correlated motion of the photo-
electrons is described in SPDI by a pair of symmetrized
amplitudes f ±(θ12, E1, E2) which depend on the relative

described by the linear polarization vector ˆe, the dipole
matrix element of SPDI can be written simply as

D ∝ f + (ˆk1 + ˆk2) · ˆe + f − (ˆk1 − ˆk2) · ˆe ,

(1)

where ˆki = ki/ki, i = 1, 2 are the unit vectors directed
along the photoelectron momenta ki. Generalization of
Eq. (1) to arbitrary polarization of light is straightfor-
ward [7]. Under the equal energy sharing condition, the
anti-symmetric amplitude vanishes f −(E1 = E2) = 0
and all the information about the SPDI process is con-
tained in one symmetric amplitude f +. Following pre-
dictions of the Wannier-type theories [8, 9], the SDPI
amplitude can be written using the Gaussian ansatz:

[10] and direct measurements [11, 12] support its validity
in a far wider photon energy range [10].

Two-photon double ionization (TPDI) of He is a much
more complex fragmentation process with two compet-
ing decay channels into the S and D two-electron con-
tinua.
In a most general case, complete separation of
the dynamic and kinematical variables in TPDI requires
introduction of ﬁve symmetrized amplitudes [13] or four
unsymmetrized amplitudes [14].

In this Letter, we demonstrate that complexity of the
TPDI leads to a new phenomenon of two distinct corre-
lated escape modes: one is associated with the center-
of-mass motion of the photoelectron pair whereas an-
other is related to their relative motion. The center-of-
mass motion favors a large total momentum of the pair
p = k1 + k2 which is gained at a parallel escape. In this
conﬁguration, the inter-electron repulsion is strongest
and the angular correlation factor has a relatively nar-
row width. On the contrary, the relative motion favors
a large relative momentum k = k1 − k2 which is max-
imized at an antiparallel escape. In this conﬁguration,
the inter-electron repulsion is weak. This results in a
profoundly large angular correlation width as compared
with the center-of-mass motion.

For simplicity, we consider equal-energy-sharing kine-
matics E1 = E2 and restrict ourselves with only the
dominant quadrupole TPDI amplitude. By performing a
derivation similar to Ref. [13], the quadrupole amplitude
can be parametrized as

method. The model proved to be capable of describing
the angular correlation pattern in the two-electron con-
tinuum in good agreement with non-perturbative, with
respect to the electromagnetic interaction, calculations
[16, 17].

We calculated amplitudes (4) in a range of excess en-
ergies E1 + E2 from 1 eV to 20 eV above the double
ionization threshold. We employed a fairly large CCC
basis set composed typically of 25 − l box-space target
states [18] with 0 ≤ l ≤ 6. Convergence of the calculation
with respect to the basis size was thoroughly tested.

In the whole excess energy range, the amplitude g0
was found insigniﬁcant as compared with gk and gp. The
latter amplitudes were ﬁtted with the Gaussian ansatz
(2). A typical quality of the ﬁt can be judged from Figure
1 where the amplitudes gk and gp are exhibited for E1 =
E2 = 2 eV. The corresponding width parameters ∆θ12
are plotted in Figure 2, as a function of energy, along
with the width parameter of the dipole amplitude fp.

Here the upper and lower sets of signs refers to gk and
gp, respectively. These amplitudes depend on the in-
terelectron angle x = cos θ12 and are expressed via the
quadrupole radial matrix elements Qll′ (k1, k2) and the
Legendre polynomial derivatives P ′′
l (x). Normalization
coeﬃcients Cl and Dl are given in Ref. [15]. Using sim-
ilar notations, the dipole amplitude of SPDI (1) under
the equal energy sharing condition is parametrized as
D ∝ fp ( ˆp· ˆe), f + ≡ fp, f − = 0. We note that D is linear
with respect to ˆp and does not contain ˆk under the equal
energy condition. In contrast, Q is quadratic with respect
to ˆk and ˆp and contains both vectors even when E1 = E2.
The amplitude gk which enters Eq. (3) with the tenso-
rial product {ˆk ⊗ ˆk}2 can be associated with the relative
motion of the photoelectron pair described by the vector
k. Similarly, the amplitudes gp can be associated with
the center-of-mass motion and the amplitude g0 which is
entering Eq. (3) with the vector product ˆk × ˆp can be
associated with the mixed motion mode.

plitudes gk (red ﬁlled circles), gp (blue open circles) and fp
(light blue squares) as functions of the excess energy E1 + E2.
Extraction of the width parameters is illustrated in Figure 1
for E1 = E2 = 2 eV.

We observe a much larger Gaussian width of the rela-
tive motion amplitude gk as compared with the center-of-
mass motion amplitudes gp and fp, the latter two having
a very similar width. We interpret this stark diﬀerence
in terms of the strength of the electron-electron repul-
sion. This strength is much larger in the center-of-mass
motion which favors large p and hence parallel emission,
as opposed to the relative motion which favors large k
associated with anti-parallel emission. We note that the
mixed mode amplitude is typically an order of magnitude
smaller than the pure mode amplitudes gk and gp thus
supporting our notion of distinct escape modes.

In the case of co-planar geometry when all three vec-
tors k1, k2 and ˆe belong to the same plane, we can choose
the coordinate frame as z k k1 and x k [k1 × k2]. In this
case, Eq. (1) and Eq. (3) are simpliﬁed to

From these equations, it is seen that the amplitudes fp
and gp related to the center-of-mass mode, and the ampli-
tude gk related to the relative motion mode, contribute
quite diﬀerently to the corresponding matrix elements.
All three amplitudes peak strongly near θ12 = 180◦.
However, the kinematic factors corresponding to fp and
gp have nodes at this angle whereas the kinematic factor
accompanying gk has a peak. As a result, the term pro-
portional to gk dominates strongly the quadrupole ampli-
tude. This dominance is illustrated in Figure 3 where the
triply-diﬀerential cross-section dσ/dE1dΩ1dΩ2 ∝ |Q|2 of
the TPDI of He at E1 = E2 = 2 eV and the coplanar
kinematics is plotted as a function of the variable escape
angle θ2. Various panels from top to bottom correspond
to ﬁxed escape angles θ1 = 0◦, 30◦, 60◦ and 90◦. Two
calculations are displayed in the ﬁgure: one with the full
quadrupole amplitude Eq. (6) and another with only the
gk contribution. The dominance of the gk term is evi-
dent at all ﬁxed angles θ2. It is particularly strong at a
ﬁx escape angle θ1 = 0 when nearly all the contribution
to the quadrupole amplitude comes from the gk term.

We note that in our previous paper [13] we introduced
a slightly diﬀerent set of amplitudes in the quadrupole
channel:

Although the set of amplitudes (8) gives an identi-
cal quadrupole amplitude, it does not provide such a
clear separation of the center-of-mass and relative mo-
tion modes. Our earlier attempt in Ref. [13] to apply the
Gaussian ansatz (2) showed no such a clear systematic
behavior of the angular correlation width with respect of
the excess energy as exhibited in Figure 2.

In conclusion, we demonstrated the presense of the
two distinct photoelectron escape modes following two-
photon double ionization of He. One of the modes corre-
sponds to the center-of-mass motion of the photoelectron
pair. It enhances the total momentum of the pair and
therefore favors the parallel emission. The inter-electron
repulsion is strong in this mode and the angular corre-
lation width is relatively small. The other, relative mo-
tion, mode enhances the relative momentum of the pair
and therefore favors the antiparallel emission. The inter-
electron repulsion is much weaker in this mode and the
angular correlation width is march larger. Both modes
are fully symmetric and present under the equal energy
sharing condition. In contrast, the single-photon double
ionization has only one fully symmetric mode which is

associated with the center-of-mass motion. This mode,
in terms of the angular correlation width, is very sim-
ilar to the center-of-mass motion mode in two-photon
double ionization. The presense of two modes is sim-
ply a reﬂection of the quadratic tensorial structure of
the quadrupole photoionization amplitude as compared
to the linear structure of the dipole photoionization am-
plitude.

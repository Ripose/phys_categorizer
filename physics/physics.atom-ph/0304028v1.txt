By the method of generalized spherical harmonic polynomials, the

Schr¨odinger equation for a four-body system in D-dimensional space is re-

duced to the generalized radial equations where only six internal variables

are involved. The problem on separating the rotational degrees of freedom

from the internal ones for a quantum N -body system in D dimensions is

generally discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent years have witnessed a ﬂurry of investigations into the arbitrary D-dimensional

problems [1–5] in many branches of physical chemistry and chemical physics. The prob-

lems associated with the D-dimensional hydrogen atom [6–8], the D-dimensional harmonic

oscillator [9–11], and the connection between the two [12–16] have been thoroughly dis-

cussed. During the past few years, with the application of dimensional scaling to the

quantum theory of atomic and molecular structure, large-D helium problem has also

been studied by many authors [17–21]. This approach requires solving the few-body

Schr¨odinger equation in a D-dimensional coordinate space and has been applied to a

large number of physically interesting problems [22–25]. Due to the complexity of the

problem for an N-body system in D dimensions, so far there is no complete theoretical

solution when N > 3.

In our recent work [26], a new method for separating the rotational degrees of free-

dom from the internal ones in a few-body system was proposed. The power of this new

approach is in its ability of great simpliﬁcation in calculation of energy levels of a few-

body system in terms of the generalized radial equations involved only internal variables,

which are derived from the Schr¨odinger equation without any approximation. Some typ-

ical three-body system in three-dimensional space, such as a helium atom [27–29] and a

positronium negative ion [30] have been solved numerically with high precision. The key

to the approach is that we have found a complete set of independent eigenfunctions of an-

gular momentum for the system, which are homogeneous polynomials in the components

of Jacobi coordinate vectors and satisfy the Laplace equation, and chosen a suitable set of

internal variables. Any wave function with a given angular momentum can be expanded

with respect to the base functions where the coeﬃcients, called the generalized radial

functions, depend only upon the internal variables. The generalized radial equations sat-

isﬁed by the generalized radial functions are easily derived owing to the nice property of

the base functions [26]. This method has been generalized to the arbitrary dimensional

space for a three-body system [31]. The exact interdimensional degeneracies in the system

can be obtained directly from the generalized radial equations [32].

To further this study, we expect to apply this approach to an N-body system in

D dimensions. As noticed in our previous paper [31], the cases with N < D are very

diﬀerent to the cases with N

D. The general formulas are hard to express uniformly

≥

due to arbitrariness of D and N. However, the main characters are manifested fully in a

four-body system of D dimensions, but not fully in a three-body system. The four-body

problems also play a fundamental role in nuclear and hypernuclear physics [33–35]. In

this paper we will study the problem of separating the rotational degrees of freedom from

the internal ones for a quantum four-body system in D dimensions in some detail. The

general case (N-body system) will be summarized.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, after separating the motion of the

center of mass by Jacobi coordinate vectors, we will deﬁne the generalized spherical har-

monic polynomials for a four-body system in D dimensions and prove that they constitute

a complete set of independent base functions for a given total orbital angular momentum

in the system. Some new features in comparison with the three-body case are also dis-

2

cussed in this section. The generalized radial equations satisﬁed by the generalized radial

functions are established in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we will generalize this method to sepa-

rate the rotational degrees of freedom from the internal ones for an N-body system in D

dimensions. Some conclusions will be given in Sec. V.

II. THE GENERALIZED SPHERICAL HARMONIC POLYNOMIALS

For a quantum N-body system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space, we denote the

position vectors and the masses of N particles by rk and by mk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N,

respectively. M =

k mk is the total mass. The Schr¨odinger equation for the N-body

on. It is straightforward to illustrate that the potential V is a function of Rj ·
rotationally invariant.

where ξj, ηj, and ζj are internal variables. It is worth noticing that for the cases 3 = D <

N two Jacobi coordinate vectors x and y can determine the body-ﬁxed frame and this set

of internal variables is not complete because two conﬁgurations with diﬀerent directions of

z reﬂecting to the plane spanned by x and y are described by the same internal variables.

As pointed in Ref. [26], the variables ζ3 has to be changed to (x

y)

z. We will further

×

·

discuss this problem in Sec. IV.

Since Eq. (7) is rotational invariant, the total orbital angular momentum is conserved.

As discussed in Ref. [31], in D-dimensional space, the wave function Ψ(x, y, z) with a given

total angular momentum has to belong to an irreducible representation of SO(D), and the

angular momentum is also denoted by the representation. For a four-body system, there

4

are only three Jacobi coordinate vectors so that the possible irreducible representation

is described by a three-row Young pattern [µ, ν, τ ] of SO(D), or its highest weight M =

(M1, M2, M3, 0, . . . , 0), where

M1 = µ

ν,

M2 = ν

τ,

M3 = τ.

−

−

(8)

We only need to consider the highest weight state Ψ[µ,ν,τ ]

M (x, y, z) because its partners can

be calculated from it by the lowering operators. In this paper the highest weight state

will be simply called the wave functions with the given angular momentum [µ, ν, τ ] for

simplicity.

Now we are going to ﬁnd a complete set of independent eigenfunctions of total orbital

angular momentum, where ”independent” means that each one in the set cannot be ex-

pressed as a combination of the remaining with coeﬃcients only depending on the internal

variables. As discussed in our previous paper [31], the spherical harmonic polynomials

(l)
m (ˆx) are homogeneous polynomials in the components of x of degree l, spanning an

Y
irreducible traceless tensor space describes by the Young pattern (l)

[l, 0, 0]. When

D > 6, the explicit forms for some polynomials with higher weights m are as follows [37]:

(l) (x) = ND,l(x1 + ix2)l,

where the last equality holds for l > 1, and ND,l denotes the normalization factor given in

[37]. The product of two spherical harmonic polynomials

the direct product of two representation (l) and (l′), which is a reducible representation.

we obtain a young tableau. A Young tableau is called standard if the digit in every

column of the tableau increases downwards and the digit in every row does not decrease

and z, respectively. Obviously, the representation [l + l′ + l”

For a given pattern [µ, ν, τ ], each standard Young tableau is determined by three

parameters q, p and r, where q is the number of digit ”1” in the ﬁrst row, p and r are

the numbers of digit ”2” in the ﬁrst and the second rows, respectively. q, p and r should

It is evident that Qµντ

qpr (x, y, z) do not contain a function of the internal variables as a
qpr (x, y, z) are

independent base functions for the given angular momentum described by [µ, ν, τ ]. Due

to Eq. (12), the set of Qµντ

qpr (x, y, z) is complete. The reason why the generalized spherical

harmonic polynomial denoted by a non-standard Young tableau is not independent can

be seen from the following identity:

This identity is similar to the Fock’s cyclic symmetry condition [38]. The left-hand-side

of Eq. (15) corresponds to a non-standard Young tableau, and two terms in the right-

hand-side correspond to two standard Young tableaux, respectively.

Since the problem on completeness of the set is very important, we are going to prove

this problem by another method. On the one hand, because the base function Qµντ

qpr (x, y, z)
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree µ + ν + τ in the components of x, y and z, we

calculate the number RD(l) of base functions in the sets for the representations [µ, ν, τ ]

with µ + ν + τ = l. Namely, we want to calculate how many homogeneous polynomials of

degree l exist in the sets of the independent base functions . We ﬁrst calculate how many

base functions exist in the set for a given representation [µ, ν, τ ]. The dimension of the

7

representation [µ, ν, τ ] of SO(D) is dD([µ, ν, τ ]):

Thus, the number of base functions in the set for the representation [µ, ν, τ ]

is

representation [µ, ν, τ ] with µ + ν + τ = l is:

Now, we turn to discuss the case D

6. As is well known, the irreducible traceless

tensor space of SO(D) described by a Young pattern has the following properties. It is

a null space if sum of the lengths of the ﬁrst two columns of the Young pattern is larger

than D. It reduces into the selfdual and antiselfdual tensor spaces if the row number of

the Young pattern is equal to D/2. Two representations are equivalent if their Young

patterns are the same as each other except for the ﬁrst column and the sum of their row

numbers is equal to D. Those properties cause the situation for D

6 diﬀerent to that

≤

for D > 6.

When D = 6, there is no problem for the representation [µ, ν, τ ] with τ = 0, but

= 0, dD([µ, ν, τ ]) in Eq. (16) is equal to the sum of the dimensions

of the selfdual and antiselfdual representations such that the equality (19) still holds for

D = 6.

When D = 5, in the possible Young pattern [µ, ν, τ ], τ has to be 0 or 1. The representa-

tion [µ, ν, 1] is equivalent to the representation [µ, ν, 0]. Their dimensions calculated from

Eq. (16) are also the same. The generalized spherical harmonic polynomials Qµντ

qpr (x, y, z)

given in Eq. (14) hold for D = 5 except for x6 = y6 = z6 = 0 and τ = 0 or 1. Therefore,

the equality (19) holds for D = 5.

For D = 3, two Jacobi coordinate vectors, say x and y, can completely determine

the body-ﬁxed frame so that the variables ζ3 has to be changed as (x

distinguish two conﬁgurations with diﬀerent directions of z. We have discussed in detail

the four-body system in three dimensions in our previous paper [26].

The case of D = 4 is quite complicated because SO(4) is not a simple group. The repre-

sentation [µ, ν, 0] reduces to a direct sum of a selfdual representation [(S)µ, ν, 0] and an an-

tiselfdual one [(A)µ, ν, 0]. The generalized spherical harmonic polynomials Q(S)µν0

III. GENERALIZED RADIAL EQUATIONS

In the preceding section we proved that d[µ,ν,τ ](SU(3)) polynomials Qµντ

qpr (x, y, z) con-

struct a complete set of independent base functions for the angular momentum [µ, ν, τ ].
Thus, any function Ψ[µ,ν,τ ]

M (x, y, z) with angular momentum [µ, ν, τ ] in the system can

be expanded with respect to the base functions Qµντ

qpr (x, y, z), where the coeﬃcients are

functions of internal variables.

where the coeﬃcients ψµντ

qpr (ξj, ηj, ζj) are called the generalized radial functions. When

substituting Eq. (26) into the Schr¨odinger equation (5), the main calculation is to apply
the Laplace operator (4) to the function Ψ[µ,ν,τ ]

M (x, y, z). The calculation consists of three

parts. In the following, we remove the arguments (ξj, ηj, ζj) and (x, y, z) for simplicity.

The ﬁrst is to apply the Laplace operator to the generalized radial functions ψµντ

qpr (ξj, ηj, ζj),

which can be calculated by replacement of variables:

where ∂ξ denotes ∂/∂ξ and so on. The second is to apply the Laplace operator to the
qpr . This part is vanishing because Qµντ

IV. QUANTUM N -BODY SYSTEM IN D DIMENSIONS

It is hard to write a uniﬁed formulas of the generalized radial equations for an N-body

system in arbitrary D-dimensions. However, from the study of the three-body [26,31]

and four-body system, we are able to summarize the main features on separating the

rotational degrees of freedom from the internal ones for an N-body Schr¨odinger equation

in D dimensions.

First, after removing the motion of the center of mass, there are (N

space it needs (D

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the problem of separating the rotational degrees of freedom from the

internal ones for the Schr¨odinger equation of a four-body system in D dimensions is studied

in detail by the method of the generalized spherical harmonic polynomials. We have

found a complete set of independent base functions with the given angular momentum

described by an irreducible representation [µ, ν, τ ] of SO(D). This set of base functions

have diﬀerent form for the case D > 6 and 3

D

6. We have provided an appropriate

≤

≤

choice of internal variables for this system and derived the generalized radial equations

depending solely on internal variables. The main features on the problem of separating

the rotational degrees of freedom from the internal ones for the Schr¨odinger equation of

a N-body system in D dimensions is summarized.

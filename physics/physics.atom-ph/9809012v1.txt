Energy Levels of Multielectron Atoms using the Sea-boson Method

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , Urbana Il 61801

In this article, we study an antithesis of the homogeneous Fermi system (jellium model)
namely a single multielectron atom using the sea-boson approach. This system in addition
to having a small number of electrons(ﬁnite system) is also extremely inhomogeneous. This
means that the plane-wave basis is ill-suited to study this system, instead we use a basis
consisting of the eigenfunctions of an electron interacting with the nucleus situated at the
origin (ideal atom). We compute the energy levels of this system and polarizabilities and
compare with the results of other approaches such as Hartree-Fock and pseudopotentials for
the former and aysmptotic wavefunctions for the latter and with experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

In our previous work1 we showed how to compute the single-particle properties of a homogeneous Fermi
system using the sea-boson method. We also generalised these ideas to include spin into the formalism2.
However, in all these approaches the implicit assumption was that the plane-wave basis was the right one to
study the system at hand. While this assumption is no doubt an excellent one for translationally invariant
systems and perhaps even for systems that are nearly homogeneous such as a crystal, it is extremely ill-suited
to study very inhomogeneous systems such as organic substances or to take an extreme example like the one
to be studied in this article, a single atom. For a single atom, we have to choose a basis that properly reﬂects
the highly localised nature of the distribution of electrons in real space. For this reason we ﬁnd that it is
best not to use the plane wave basis but its antithesis, namely wavefunctions that are eigenfunctions of the
noninteracting electrons interacting with just the nucleus. In the next section, we show how to write down
formulas for the number conserving product of two Fermi/Bose ﬁelds in terms of the sea-bosons but this
time in the localised (relatively speaking, relative to plane-waves) basis which are the eigenfunctions of the
electrons interacting with the nucleus at the origin. Following this, we write down a model hamiltonian that
describes a system consisting of electrons interacting with themelves and with a bosonic nucleus situated at
the origin. This may be diagonalised exactly in what is now an analog of RPA in the localised basis and go
on to compute the energy levels of this system.

II. PARENT-BILINEAR SEA-BOSON CORRESPONDENCE

Let us deﬁne H0 = −∇

2m + U (~r), U (~r) = −Z e2/r. Then its eigenfunctions may be written down as follows,

The hamiltonian for this problem may be cast in the following form,

H0ϕi(~r) = ǫiϕi(~r)

K =

d~r

Z

Xσ

ψ†(~rσ)(

+ U (~r))ψ(~rσ)

−∇2

This may be written in the canonical basis as,

The seaboson is deﬁned as follows,

Here ¯n0(~iσ) is the ground state distribution of electrons of the ideal atom. For example in the case of helium
¯n0(~i = 1s, σ) = 1, for either spin, and ¯n0(~i = 2s, 2p, ...σ) = 0.

The above correspondence reproduces the following salient features of the free theory,
(1) The deﬁnition in Eq.( 4) when plugged into the formula for the number operator Eq.( 8) gives an identity.
(2) The dynamical four-point and six-point functions of the free theory are reproduced properly. That is if
one computes the correlators of the fermi bilinears in Eq.( 7) using the free hamiltonian in Eq.( 3), one gets
what one expects.
(3) The commutation rules are reproduced only in the ”RPA”-sense.

A. Properties of the Ideal Atom in the Sea-boson Language

In the previous section E0 was the ground state energy. It is computed as follows. Let us assume we have
N electrons in our system. This means that we have our eigenstates ﬁlled upto imax starting from i = 0
B = {i = 0, 1, 2, ..., imax}. each i has at most two electrons with spin up or down. Let us consider an even
number of electrons,

The ground state of this system is annhilated by the sea-bosons,

also the sea-boson has the propety that(a postulate if you like),

N = 2 × (imax + 1)

E0 = 2ǫ0 + 2ǫ1 + ... + 2ǫimax

′

a~iσ(~jσ

)|Gi = 0

′

a~iσ(~jσ

) = 0; f or ǫj < ǫi

This allows us to construct the ﬁrst excited state of this system as

|E1i = a†

i=imaxσ((j = imax + 1)σ

)|Gi

′

′

where the spins σ, σ
can be anything. It says that the ﬁrst excited state is degenerate. That is, you can
take a spin up or down electron situated at i = imax and elevate it to i = imax + 1 and that electron can be
of either spin as well. Hence the four-fold degeneracy. The energy of the ﬁrst excited state is given by,

E1 = 2ǫ0 + 2ǫ1 + ... + 2ǫimax + (ǫimax+1 − ǫimax )

Having convinced ourselves of the correctness of the formalism as regards the ideal atom we proceed to study
the full problem.

IV. THE NONIDEAL ATOM

In order to compute the energy levels of the nonideal atom, we proceed as follows. First let us rewrite the

interaction term in the sea-boson language.

The eigenvalues ωIσ that correspond to energies of the excited states measured with respect to the ground

here we must impose the additional constraint,

in order that excited states have higher energies than the ground state. Further since we have constraint
[dIσ, d†

Iσ] = 1, the matrix Gσ may itself be computed by the following equation,

Gσ(~i,~j) = 0; ǫj < ǫi

From the above form of the full hamiltonian it is clear that having obtained the eigenvalues ωIσ the next
step would be to arrange the various excited states according to whether or not (ǫj − ǫi) > ωIσ There is also
the issue of whether we are allowed to excite any number of sea-bosons all with the same label Iσ (since
they are bosons). The answer is no, since they have to describe particle-hole excitations of the atom and
the elemetary particles are electrons. In order to answer this question we have to follow closely the section
where we showed how to study the ideal atom in the sea-boson language. There however we conveniently
glossed over this thorny issue(sort of). But it is hoped that the reader appreciates the spirit of the argument
and will not examine this ﬂaw under a microscope. The whole formalism has to be taken with a grain of
salt (a tall glass of milk, a jar of pickles and a can of diet coke !).

The ground state energy of the system may be obtained by merely computing the expectation value of

the kinetic energy and the potential energy separately and adding them together.

Abstract

In this article we present TDCS for equal energy sharing kinematics for double
photoionization of the helium atom at 20 and 40eV above threshold in the framework
of the hyperspherical partial wave theory. This supplements our earlier work [1] in
which we were able to show gauge independence in our formalism. Also in this work
we treat cases in which the Stokes parameter S1 < 1 so that linear polarization of
the photon source is also taken into account. Agreement in shape with the CCC
[9,12] data and the experiments appears to be excellent.

Key words: Photo double ionization, helium, hyperspherical, partial wave, cross

1 Introduction

Photo double ionization (PDI) of the helium is one of those fundamental
atomic processes which has received wide attention from both theorists and
experimentalists. Helium is one of the most abundant elements in stellar atmo-
spheres and hence analysis of Helium spectra is of considerable importance in
astrophysics. From the theoretical aspect, the absorption of a photon and sub-
sequent ejection of both electrons from the Helium atom into the continuum,

leads to a pure Coulomb three body problem which, at low incident energies,
involve complex short range interactions and strong electron correlations that
are diﬃcult to treat theoretically and hence present a challenge to theorists.

The helium PDI is similar to the electron impact ionization of atomic hydro-
gen. However, due to the 1Se symmetry of the initial state, the ﬁnal state can
be only of 1Po symmetry. This leads to considerable simpliﬁcation in computa-
tions in contrast to e-H ionization, in which there are many more contributing
states in the ﬁnal channel. Also there are selection rules that are valid only
for photo double ionization [2] (for a recent review see [8]).

As is well known, the PDI triple diﬀerential cross-section (TDCS) can be
calculated in three gauges, namely length, velocity and acceleration (L, V, A)
gauges. In principle the TDCS must be independent of the choice of gauge.
However, it has been shown by Lucy et al [3] that the TDCS results are
notoriously gauge dependent unless one uses very accurate wave functions for
both initial and ﬁnal channels. In our previous work [1] we had been able to
show that our results are largely gauge independent and L and V gauge results
obtained were nearly identical. We now have the TDCS results in the A gauge
and we will make a brief comparison between the TDCS in L, V and A gauges
below before we study other cases. Also in our work [1] we obtained TDCS
at 20eV incident photon energy and our results were for unpolarized incident
photon source. Having obtained an essentially gauge independent formalism,
in this work we present double photoionization TDCS at 20 and 40eV above
the helium double ionization threshold 79eV. Also we choose situations in
which the incident photon beam is polarized, the degree of polarization being
given by the Stokes parameter S1.

The double ionization TDCS is obtained from the transition matrix elements
given by

Tf i = hΨ(−)

|Vi|Φii,

Vi = ~ǫ · ~D.

where Φi(~r1, ~r2) is the helium ground state, ~r1 and ~r2 being the coordinates of
the two electrons with respect to the helium nucleus (assumed to be at rest).

S1, the TDCS is given by (see [14] for example and references therein)

2 Theory

The hyperspherical partial wave theory (HPW) is discussed in considerable
detail in our earlier work [1]. Therefore we give here only the essentials.

For the Helium ground state we take a highly correlated 20 term Hylleraas type
wave function given by Hart and Herzberg [4]. To calculate the ﬁnal channel
continuum state Ψ(−)

arctan(r2/r1), ˆr1 = (θ1, φ1), ˆr2 = (θ2, φ2) and ω = (α, ˆr1, ˆr2). Also we set
P =
2, α0 = arctan(p2/p1), ˆp1 = (θp1, φp1), ˆp2 = (θp2, φp2) and ω0 =
(α0, ˆp1, ˆp2) where ˆri and ˆpi (i = 1, 2) are the coordinates and momenta of
the ith particle. Ψ(−)
is then expanded in hyperspherical harmonics [5,6] that
are functions of the ﬁve angular variables and ℓ1, ℓ1, n, L, M. These are
respectively the angular momenta of the two electrons, the order of the Jacobi
polynomial in the hyperspherical harmonics, the total angular momentum and
its projection. For a given symmetry s we decompose the ﬁnal state as

For actual computations we truncate the set of equations to some maximum

lier works [1,7] with considerable rigor. So we omit the details in this work.
Knowing the radial wave solution, the ﬁnal channel state can be found from

3 Results and discussion

For the calculations reported here, our computed SDCS at E/2 (E being the
excess photon energy) is slightly higher from the desired values (0.93 Kb/eV
at E = 20eV and about 0.32-0.35Kb/ev [10,11,14] for E = 40 eV). Therefore
we scale our SDCS to the desired value by multiplying with a constant factor
(0.8 for E = 20eV and 0.56 for E = 40eV ) for each energy, and also scale our
TDCS with the same factor. In this way we are able to obtain the absolute
TDCS.

3.1 Gauge independence

As remarked earlier, in our previous work [1] we had been able to show that
our work is largely gauge independent. There, independence of the TDCS
with respect to the length and velocity gauges had been presented. We now
have the TDCS computed in the acceleration gauge and these are presented in
ﬁgure 1.

Apart from slight departures near the peaks, the length and velocity gauge
results are identical. The velocity and acceleration gauge results are indistin-
guishable. The gauge independence in our results is a strong signature that
our ﬁnal channel wave function has the correct asymptotic and short range
behaviour. Since the velocity and acceleration gauge results are identical, in

3.2 Results for 20eV excess energy

In this section we display our results for 99eV incident photon energy and
include polarization eﬀects by selecting cases with Stokes parameter S1 < 1.

In ﬁgure 2 we compare our results with experimental data from Briggs and
Schmidt [8] and the results of the CCC theory [9,12]. Since the experimental
data are not absolute we have normalized the data in each set to our computed
results. Also the CCC results in ﬁgure 2 (b) and (c) have been scaled with a
factor 0.45. The agreement of the present results with the experiment and the
CCC results appears to be good everywhere in shape, except for a secondary
peak near θ2 = 150o at θ1 = 180o (ﬁgure 2 (a)). This may appear unphysical
as the repulsive nature of the Coulomb potential suppresses ejection of both
electrons in the same direction. However, we see from the other ﬁgures that
perhaps θ1 = 180o is the only situation where this behaviour occurs. In all
other cases, zero cross-section whenever ejection of both electrons in the same
direction occurs, is reproduced correctly. To see whether the additional struc-

5

ture in ﬁgure 2 (a) remains, we may need to perform a much larger calculation,
that involves the inclusion of many more partial waves in our ﬁnal state wave
function. This may well be beyond the capabilities of our present computa-

at this point that all computations reported here were done on desktop com-

Figure 4 shows our results for excess energy photon energy E = 40 eV and
Stokes parameter S1 = 0.8. Shown also are the experimental results from
Cvejanovi´c et al [14] and the CCC results presented in Ref. [14]. The ex-

in all cases. All CCC results have also been scaled by the same factor 0.33.
Agreement in shape with the experimental results appear to be excellent ev-
erywhere, except in ﬁgures 2 (d) and (e) where there are slight departures
around θ2 = 1500. The CCC results are also almost identical with respect to
the shapes.

4 Conclusions

In this work, we have presented results for equal energy sharing photo double
ionization of the helium atom at 20 eV and 40 eV excess energy. Gauge inde-
pendence of our TDCS results are shown. Cases in which the incident photo
beam has linear polarization are considered, in contrast to our previous work
[1] where we dealt with unpolarized light. Comparisons are made with the
experiments and the CCC theory wherever available and the results are seen
to be consistent in shape. In the absence of absolute TDCS measurements for
the chosen kinematics and experimental geometry, we cannot say anything
about the correctness of the magnitude of our results.

In a future work, we propose to deal with unequal energy sharing kinematics.
However, we also mention that due to computational limitations we cannot
reproduce results for extremely asymmetric energy sharing at this moment. As
noted in our work [7] high Rydberg states tend to interfere with our continuum
state giving undesirable results. To cope with these situations, considerably
more computational resources may be necessary.

We have studied the eﬀects of chirped femtosecond laser pulses on the formation of ultracold
molecules in a Rb magneto-optical trap. We have found that application of chirped femtosecond
pulses suppressed the formation of 85Rb2 and 87Rb2 a3Σ+
u molecules in contrast to comparable
non-chirped pulses, cw illumination, and background formation rates. Variation of the amount of
chirp indicated that this suppression is coherent in nature, suggesting that coherent control is likely
to be useful for manipulating the dynamics of ultracold quantum molecular gases.

Achieving control of the dynamics of quantum sys-
tems has been a long-standing goal of physics and chem-
istry [1, 2]. Rapid advances in the manipulation of
laser-matter interactions to obtain desired outcomes by
means of tailored optical ﬁelds have been enabled by
the development of ultrafast femtosecond optical sources
and pulse-shaping techniques. In particular, recent suc-
cesses include exciting a priori speciﬁed quantum states
in atoms [3] and molecules [4], as well as in selectively
cleaving chemical bonds in complex molecules [5]. Si-
multaneously, a very diﬀerent thrust has been extending
the regime of the ultracold (T ≤ 1 mK) to simple molec-
ular complexes [6]. Robust samples of trapped ultracold
molecules are expected to facilitate signiﬁcant advances
in molecular spectroscopy, collision studies, and perhaps
quantum computation [7, 8].

The diﬃculty in generalizing laser cooling techniques
to molecules has stimulated exploration of alternative
approaches to producing ultracold molecules. One ap-
proach, using magnetic Feshbach resonances, has led
to the observation of molecular Bose-Einstein conden-
sates [9, 10, 11]. The study of other routes to ultra-
cold molecule formation has also been a topic of in-
tense activity [12]. An extremely successful optical ap-
proach has been to photoassociate molecules from ultra-
cold atoms [13]. In this method, a sample of ultracold
atoms is irradiated by a cw laser tuned to excite free
atoms to weakly bound excited states. Stable ground-
state molecules may then form by spontaneous emission,
provided the Franck-Condon overlap factors are favor-
able. Ultracold molecules have been observed using this
technique for a variety of homonuclear [14, 15, 16, 17]
and heteronuclear [18, 19, 20, 21] alkali metal species.

Recent proposals have suggested controlling the inter-
actions between ultracold atoms with tailored picosecond
optical ﬁelds [22, 23, 24, 25]. The possibility of improved
formation of ultracold molecules using femtosecond co-
herent control techniques is therefore enticing. This Let-
ter describes the ﬁrst experiments designed to enhance
the molecule formation process in a magneto-optical trap

(MOT) [26] with chirped femtosecond pulses [36]. A
schematic of the experiments is shown in Fig. 1. The
broad bandwidth of femtosecond pulses permits excita-
tion over a longer range of internuclear distances than
picosecond pulses, thus addressing a larger number of
atom pairs. Furthermore, chirping the pulse introduces
an asymmetry in the temporal evolution of the ﬁeld, pro-
moting an adiabatic transfer to the excited state without
detrimental population cycling [27]. This method also
provides a route to optimal control of ultracold molecule
formation [28]. Recent experiments using picosecond [29]
and chirped nanosecond [30] pulses for photoassociation
(PA) provide encouragement for this approach.

Femtosecond (fs) chirped-pulse PA was undertaken in
an Rb MOT because its trapping transition (780.27 nm)
is near the peak of the gain proﬁle for Ti:sapphire
(800 nm). Each isotope of Rb could be trapped by ad-
justment of the MOT trapping and repumping laser fre-
quencies. Typical traps contained 2 × 107 atoms in a
spheroidal cloud of diameter 0.7 mm, yielding a peak den-
sity on the order of 1010 cm−3. The temperature of the
atoms in the MOT was measured to be 170 µK using the
release and recapture method [31].

Two diﬀerent PA lasers were employed to study
the eﬀects of light on the molecule formation process
in the MOT. The ﬁrst was a cw free-running diode
laser (Sanyo DL7140-201) with an output power of
56 mW, temperature-tuned between 700–785 nm. The
second laser was a commercial femtosecond-pulse os-
cillator (Spectra-Physics Mai Tai) whose carrier wave-
length was tunable between 750–850 nm with output
power ≤ 800 mW over this range. This laser had a rep-
etition rate of 80 MHz and produced Gaussian-envelope
transform-limited pulses of temporal intensity full-width
at half-maximum (FWHM) < 100 fs, corresponding to
a spectral bandwidth FWHM > 90 cm−1 for the avail-
able carrier wavelength range. Its output spectrum was
monitored with a spectrometer and its ﬁeld proﬁle was
regularly characterized using Spectral Interferometry for
Direct Electric Field Reconstruction (SPIDER) [32].

Molecules formed in the MOT were detected via
time-of-ﬂight (TOF) ion-mass spectroscopy. A narrow-
bandwidth (< 3 GHz) tunable pulsed dye laser pumped
by the second harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (9 ns pulse
duration at a repetition rate of 50 Hz) ionized the MOT
cloud with pulses of energy 500 µJ. The PA and ioniza-
tion lasers were merged onto the same beampath with
a dichroic beamsplitter and focused at the MOT cloud,
ensuring that the sample that we ionized was the same as
that aﬀected by our PA lasers. A channel electron mul-
tiplier (channeltron) biased with −2.2 kV and positioned
a few cm below the MOT detected the ions.

We chose to detect ground triplet state a3Σ+

u Rb2
molecules, which have been observed to form sponta-
neously in the MOT through one or both of two chan-
nels: PA stimulated by the MOT lasers themselves,
and three-body recombination [16, 33]. The ionization
wavelength was tuned to 602.7 nm, which ionizes ground
triplet state molecules via a resonant two-photon exci-
tation (X 2Σg ← (2)3Πg ← a3Σ+
u ). To ensure that the
detected molecules were in their ground state, the MOT
and PA lasers were shut oﬀ for at least 1 µs before the ar-
rival of the ionization laser pulse to allow the atoms and
molecules in the MOT to decay to their ground states.
The cw diode lasers were shuttered using acousto-optic
modulators, while the high peak powers of the fs PA laser
pulses necessitated a half-wave Pockels-cell and polariz-
ing beamsplitter cube arrangement. For a 85Rb MOT

2–3 ions per pulse, while for a 87Rb MOT the rate was
signiﬁcantly lower (0.3–0.8 ions per pulse).

A typical experiment involved applying one of the PA
lasers to the MOT, applying the ionizing laser, and ac-
cumulating ion counts for a set number of ionization
laser shots Nshots. A background scan with the PA laser
blocked was then immediately acquired for another Nshots
to determine the relative eﬀect of the PA laser.

The cw PA laser was focused on the MOT with an
intensity of around 103 W cm−2. For an 87Rb MOT,
the molecular signal was increased for detunings of a
few cm−1 below the trapping transition, with signiﬁcant
enhancement (by a factor of 1.5–2) at frequencies cor-
responding to resonant transitions to excited molecular
vibrational states. For 85Rb, the molecular signal was
unaﬀected at resonant transition frequencies, and gen-
erally reduced below the background level by 50% at
non-resonant frequencies. These results conﬁrm those
of Ref. [16], where the quenching phenomenon was in-
terpreted as a coupling of molecules that form sponta-
neously in the 85Rb MOT to excited dissociative states.
In order to promote the greatest possibility of pho-
toassociative excitations by the fs pulses, care was taken
to select a pulse spectrum with power concentrated in
the region just below the 5S+5P3/2 dissociation limit
(780 nm). The carrier wavelength of the fs laser was
tuned to 783 nm. A 4f prism-lens-lens-prism spectral ﬁl-
ter was used to ensure that the broad spectrum of the fs
pulses did not contain signiﬁcant power on the blue side
of the D2 line (which would lead to direct excitation of
atoms to repulsive states lying above the 5S+5P3/2 dis-
sociation limit). The fs pulse power was attenuated to
≤ 0.3 nJ per pulse, corresponding to focused peak inten-
sities on the order of 107 W cm−2.

Application of the spectrally-ﬁltered fs-pulse PA laser
to 85Rb and 87Rb MOTs generally caused a strong re-
duction in the molecular ion signal as compared to back-
ground. In the case of a 85Rb MOT, the quenching ob-

served due to the fs PA laser was stronger than that
induced by the cw PA laser. In the case of a 87Rb MOT,
contrary to the augmentative eﬀect observed when the cw
PA laser was applied, ∼ 50% fewer molecular ions with
respect to background were observed upon application of
the fs laser under similar experimental conditions. 85Rb+
2
ionization spectra for 600–610 nm recorded for the cases
of no PA laser, cw PA laser, and fs PA laser had similar
structure. Variation of the average power of the fs PA
laser revealed evidence of an exponential-decay depen-
dence of molecular ion yield on pulse power (see Fig. 2).

We further explored the eﬀects of fs pulses on the
molecular formation rate by varying the spectral chirp
of the pulses. The 100 fs FWHM pulses were chirped by
passing the beam 13 times through a 5.0 in.-length plane-
parallel dispersive glass block (νd = 37.2). The chirped
pulses had an estimated temporal intensity FWHM of
5.8 ps. To test whether the quenching eﬀect involved res-
onant excitation of ground state atoms by the fs laser, we
also tuned its carrier wavelength to 850 nm (as far to the
red as experimentally feasible) and removed the spectral
ﬁlter. A spectrometer was used to conﬁrm that the spec-
trum of the chirped pulses did not diﬀer substantially
from that of non-chirped pulses.

Due to run-to-run drift of the MOT conditions and
the signiﬁcant time required to re-align the setup when
removing and re-inserting the glass block into the PA
laser beampath, we implemented a “real-time” diﬀeren-
tial measurement to compare the eﬀects of chirped and
non-chirped fs pulses. A schematic diagram of the ex-
perimental setup appears in Fig. 3. A broadband 50:50
beamsplitter was used to split the fs laser beam into two
identical components. The dispersive glass block was in-
serted into the path of one of these beams (hereafter the
“chirped beam”). The second, transform-limited, beam
(the “reference beam”) was attenuated with absorptive
neutral density ﬁlters so that each beam had the same av-
erage power, to ±1% accuracy. An optical chopper wheel
was aligned such that at any given instant one beam was
blocked and the other was allowed to pass. Downstream
from the chopper, the two beams were merged onto the
same beampath using a second 50:50 broadband beam-
splitter. From this point forward, the two beams were
aligned and focused to the MOT position as usual.

The experiment timing was set up so that for a single
rotation of the chopper wheel, one chirped pulse exper-
iment and one reference pulse experiment occurred in
sequence (see Fig. 3). The TOF data acquisition was
performed in “toggle” mode: TOF traces acquired for
chirped pulse cases were added to the TOF histogram
and traces acquired for reference pulse cases were sub-
tracted from the histogram, yielding a net diﬀerence TOF
histogram. A baseline diﬀerential measurement for the
case with the dispersive glass block removed in Fig. 3 re-
vealed a diﬀerence between two identical beams of fewer

The results of an experiment comparing the eﬀects of
a pulse train of 5.8 ps pulses to the eﬀects of a pulse train
of 100 fs pulses are shown in Fig. 4. The diﬀerential TOF
trace reveals no discernable diﬀerence in the number of
atomic ions, and a sharp negative feature in the vicinity
of the arrival time of 85Rb+
2 ions. The magnitude of this
feature exceeded the baseline experiment Rb+
2 detection
rate by 400%. The negative feature in Fig. 4 signiﬁes that
appreciably more Rb+
2 ions were accumulated after ap-
plication of the transform-limited reference pulses. Thus,
the chirped pulses quenched the Rb+
2 ion signal more
than the reference pulses. Since the chirped pulses had
a peak intensity ∼ 70 times smaller than the reference
pulses, this quenching eﬀect was not solely dependent on
the peak intensity, but also on the phase of the applied
optical ﬁeld. The quenching tended to increase with in-
creasing chirp magnitude, although this trend was not
monotonic as some chirp values were signiﬁcantly more
eﬀective than others. These results provide evidence that
the quenching eﬀect is a coherent phenomenon in which
wave packet dynamics play some role.

u or the excited (1)3Σ+

mation rate on applied fs pulse peak intensity is consis-
tent with a single-photon excitation loss from either the
detected a3Σ+
g states. There
are several coherent excitation pathways for 850 nm light
that could be responsible for a reduction in the num-
ber of detected a3Σ+
u molecules. One is excitation of ex-
cited molecules in the (1)3Σ+
g states to bound states
in potentials that dissociate to 5P+5P ((6)3Σ+
u , (7)3Σ+
u ,
and (4)3Πu)—all of which are “dark” to our detection
scheme—or to dissociative states lying above the 5S+6P
dissociation limit. Another possibility is that a wave
packet is excited from the ground state a3Σ+
u onto the
C3R−3 potential of the (1)3Σ+
g state. This wave packet
may have enhanced Franck-Condon overlaps with either
continuum states lying above the 5S+5S dissociation
limit or undetected a3Σ+
u bound states, thus resulting in
a decrease in the number of detected a3Σ+
u molecules [34].
In summary, we observed that application of femtosec-
ond pulses designed to photoassociate ultracold atoms
results in a decrease, rather than an increase, in the for-
mation of stable ultracold a3Σ+
u molecules. We found
that chirped pulses are more eﬃcient at stimulating this
quenching phenomenon than non-chirped pulses of equiv-
alent power and spectral character. This result provides
evidence that the quenching is a coherent process, al-
though we are unable to distinguish the speciﬁc excita-
tion pathway stimulated by the femtosecond pulses. Fur-
ther experimental and theoretical study of femtosecond
pulses for optimal control of photoassociative ultracold
molecule formation is warranted, particularly for the cre-
ation of stable singlet molecules whose deeper X 1Σ+
g po-
tential may be better suited to the broad inherent band-

width of femtosecond pulses.

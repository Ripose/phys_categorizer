A combined experimental and theoretical study of transition matrix elements of the 6p 2Pj →
8s 2S1/2 transition in atomic Cs is reported. Measurements of the polarization-dependent two-
photon excitation spectrum associated with the transition were made in an approximately 200
cm−1 range on the low frequency side of the 6s 2S1/2 → 6p 2P3/2 resonance. The measurements
depend parametrically on the relative transition matrix elements, but also are sensitive to far-oﬀ-
resonance 6s 2S1/2 → np 2Pj → 8s 2S1/2 transitions. In the past, this dependence has yielded a
generalized sum rule, the value of which is dependent on sums of relative two-photon transition
matrix elements.
In the present case, best available determinations from other experiments are
combined with theoretical matrix elements to extract the ratio of transition matrix elements for
the 6p 2Pj → 8s 2S1/2 (j = 1/2,3/2) transition. The resulting experimental value of 1.423(2) is in
excellent agreement with the theoretical value, calculated using a relativistic all-order method, of
1.425(2).

INTRODUCTION

Although some of the earliest experiments in atomic
physics were measurements of atomic lifetimes and os-
cillator strengths [1, 2], precise determination of atomic
transition matrix elements remains a demanding enter-
prise [3, 4, 5, 6]. Some perspective on this may be gained
by noting that, in spite of the development of a wide
array of sophisticated experimental techniques, measure-
ments depending directly on atomic transition matrix
elements seldom have achieved a precision better than
∼ 0.5 % this being for the deeply studied alkali atoms
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Measure-
ments made for non-alkali atoms, often motivated by the
need for data in some other area of atomic physics re-
search [1, 17, 18, 19, 20], have typically cited even lower
precision. We have similarly been concerned with precise
measurements in alkali atoms, and we have a continuing
experimental program of precision measurement of rela-
tive and absolute transition matrix elements in the one-
electron atoms [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. The main experimen-
tal approaches have been based either on polarization-
dependent Rayleigh and Raman scattering in atomic Cs,
or on polarization-dependent two-photon spectroscopy
applied to Na and Rb.

In spite of the fact that many experimental [8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 26] and theoretical [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] ap-
proaches have been applied to determination of atomic
properties of atomic 133Cs, including lifetimes or oscil-
lator strengths and polarizabilities, only limited higher
precision experimental data is available for many valence

transition matrix elements in this atom. These studies
have been motivated in part by a serious need for empir-
ical data to extract more fundamental information from
precise measurement of parity nonconservation (PNC) in
this atom [33], especially in light of the discrepancy re-
ported in [34] between values of the weak charge Qw ex-
tracted from high precision atomic physics experiment
[33] and the accepted Standard Model value.
In order
to clarify the situation, recent experimental eﬀorts have
concentrated on measurement of transition matrix ele-
ments associated with the 6s - 6p and 6s - 7p multi-
plet transitions [12, 13]. However, the 6p - 7s and 7p -
7s transitions, which are less experimentally accessible,
make similarly important contributions. The availability
of high-precision experimental data for any transitions
between low-lying states of Cs is important for provid-
ing additional information regarding the accuracy of the
theoretical calculations in Cs which is crucial for the ac-
curate analysis of Cs PNC experiment.

In this paper we present results of our measurements
of the spectral and polarization dependence of the 6s
2S1/2 → 6p 2Pj → 8s 2S1/2 (j = 1/2,3/2) two-color, two-
photon transition in 133Cs, where n = 6 is the dominant
term.
In an earlier report [22] we described how such
measurements could be interpreted in terms of a type
of sum rule related to the scalar and vector transition
probabilities. The sum rule is evaluated by ﬁtting exper-
imental polarization-dependent spectra to a generalized
form containing, as ﬁtting parameters, the relative two-
photon transition matrix elements for the contributing
transitions, allowing extraction of the ratio of the matrix

elements in the dominant term. The contributions from
far-oﬀ-resonance transitions are small but signiﬁcant for
heavy atoms such as Cs and are evaluated theoretically.
In the present report we describe that approach as ap-
plied to the Cs 6s 2S1/2 → 8s 2S1/2 two-photon transi-
tion. By combining the present measurements with pre-
cisely determined 6s 2S1/2 → 6p 2Pj resonance transition
matrix elements, the 6p 2Pj → 8s 2S1/2 relative excited
state matrix elements are determined. We point out that
the same combined scheme can eﬀectively be used to de-
termine matrix elements for the 6s 2S1/2 → 7p 2Pj → 7,
8s 2S1/2 transitions which, because of their importance
for analysis of the precision parity nonconservation mea-
surements in Cs, remain interesting cases to investigate
[13].

In the following sections, we brieﬂy review our exper-
imental approach, with particular attention to aspects
new in the present study. This is followed by a de-
scription of our experimental results and data analysis.
We then describe the application of results of relativistic
many-body calculations of the oﬀ-resonance terms, which
allows the extraction of the desired two-photon transition
matrix element ratios. Finally, the relative 6p 2Pj → 8s
2S1/2 relative transition matrix elements are determined
and compared with theoretical calculations.

II. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH

The general experimental approach is described in pre-
vious reports [21, 22, 24, 25], and so will only brieﬂy be
reviewed here. The basic experimental scheme [21] is

2

illustrated in Figure 1, which contains a partial energy
level diagram for the lowest few levels of atomic Cs. A
block diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown

ground level are excited by two-photon absorption to the
8s 2S1/2 ﬁnal level.
In principle, all the intermediate
np 2Pj levels, including continuum terms, contribute to
the total excitation probability [35].
In practice, and
depending on the precision of the measurements, signiﬁ-
cant contributions are limited to the ﬁrst few nearest-to-
resonance terms. The ﬁrst step of the excitation scheme
is accomplished with an Ar+ laser pumped Ti:Sapphire
laser (laser 1) tuned in a several-hundred cm−1 energy
range to the red of the 6s 2S1/2 → 6p 2Pj transition,
which has a hyperﬁne-weighted transition frequency of
ω3/2 = 11732.31 cm−1 [36, 38]. With reference to Figure
1, the detuning from one-photon resonance is deﬁned as
∆ = ω1 - ω3/2, where the laser 1 frequency is ω1. Al-
though detunings of magnitude greater than 200 cm−1
were investigated, useful data was obtained only for | ∆ |
< 200 cm−1. A Michelson-inteferometer type wavemeter,
which has a precision of 10−3 cm−1, is used to determine
ω1. The Ti:Sapphire laser is passively stabilized with
a thin-thick etalon combination and has a short term
line width on the order of a few MHz. Long-term drifts,
on a time scale longer than a typical data run of a few
minutes, are dominated mainly by thermal and mechan-
ical noise, and have a negligible inﬂuence on the experi-
mental results. The average power is approximately 200
mW. The laser 1 output is strongly linearly polarized,
which is further puriﬁed by passing the beam through
a Glan-Thompson prism polarizer. The beam is then
passed through an electronically controlled liquid crystal
retardation wave plate (LCR), which switches the linear
polarization direction to one of two orthogonal linear po-
larization directions. The resulting variable polarization
beam is then directed to the Cs sample cell. The second
excitation step is driven by the linearly polarized out-
put from an external cavity diode laser (ECDL, laser 2),
which generates an average power of 8 mW in a short-
term (∼ 1 s) bandwidth ∼ 1 MHz. The laser has a fre-
quency ω2 which nominally satisﬁes the two-photon reso-
nance condition ω1 + ω2 = ω0, where ω0 is the frequency
separation of hyperﬁne components of the 6s 2S1/2 and
8s 2S1/2 levels. The degeneracy-weighted hyperﬁne av-
eraged value of ω0 = 24317.17 cm−1 [36]. The laser 2
frequency is determined from the detuning according to
ω2 = ω0 - ω3/2 - ∆. When ∆ = 0, the excited state
resonance frequency is ω2 = 12584.82 cm−1 [36]. The
commercial ECDL is piezoelectrically scannable over a
range of approximately 15 GHz around the two-photon
resonance. The diode laser output beam is made to be
nearly collinear with that from the Ti:Sapphire laser and
the two beams are weakly focused with 0.5 m focal length
lenses and overlapped in the central region of a sample
cell assembly.

The Cs vapor cell is an evacuated and sealed Pyrex
cell having a length of about 7.5 cm and a diameter of

2.5 cm. Research grade windows are fused directly onto
the cell body, leaving about a 2.0 cm diameter undis-
torted central region for transmission of the laser beams.
The cell is prepared on an oil-free vacuum system, and
is evacuated to a base pressure of about 10−8 mbar. A
small amount of Cs metal is driven into the cell prior to
removing it from the vacuum system. The cell tempera-
ture is varied by placing it in a resistively heated oven,
which allows heating to a typical temperature of 375 K,
corresponding to a Cs vapor density of about 2.6 x 1011
cm−3. The cell temperature is stabilized to about ± 0.1
K using a thermocouple attached to the coolest part of
the cell; the thermocouple output is fed back to the oven
power supply.

Two-photon resonance signals are monitored by mea-
surement of the 7p 2Pj → 6s 2S1/2 cascade ﬂuorescence
at 455 nm and 459 nm. The ﬂuorescence is collected at
right angles to the laser beams by a short focal length
ﬁeld lens (∼ 5 cm), which approximately collimates the
ﬂuorescence light on the cathode of a red-light sensitive
photomultipler tube (PMT). The tube is protected from
background light and the intense laser beams by a combi-
nation of colored glass and narrow band interference ﬁl-
ters. Infrared transmitting colored glass ﬁlters mounted
on the entrances to the oven housing further reduce back-
ground light signals. The PMT output is ampliﬁed and
the photon counting rate measured with a commercial
100 MHz photon counter. Typical counting rates on two-
photon resonance are ∼ 103 s−1. We point out that the
operating temperature of 375 K turns out to be optimal
for this experiment. At lower temperatures the ﬂuores-
cence signals are weak, while at elevated temperatures,
and correspondingly larger Cs atom density, the vapor
becomes optically thick to the 7p 2Pj → 6s 2S1/2 sig-
nal radiation. Then branching to the 7s 2S1/2 and 6d
2Dj levels (see Figure 1) is enhanced, and signals in the
observed decay channel are correspondingly reduced.

The various instruments are globally controlled or
monitored by a computerized data acquisition and in-
strument control program. To illustrate the experimen-

3

tal protocol, consider a typical experimental run, where
laser 1 is set to a nominal frequency, which is measured
by the wavemeter, which passes this value to the main
control program. Sequentially, the photon-counting rate
is measured alternately for collinear and perpendicular
linear polarization directions of the two lasers. The re-
tardance of the LCR is controlled with a specially writ-
ten instrument driver that communicates with the LCR
hardware via the computer parallel port. The frequency
of the ECDL (laser 2) is then shifted by piezoelectrically
scanning the ECDL cavity length; this is achieved by di-
rect communication between the ECDL controller and
the main experiment computer. The wavemeter reading
is recorded again and the data cycle is repeated. This ex-
perimental protocol is very eﬀective for determining the
shape of the excitation line, and for assessing the blend-
ing of diﬀerent hyperﬁne components of the excitation
line shape. An alternate data-taking protocol was also
employed. In this, once a proper setting of laser 2 was
determined which minimized the inﬂuence of hyperﬁne
blending (see discussion section) on the measured polar-
ization, the laser 2 frequency was not scanned. Data was
then accumulated by switching the laser polarization un-
til suﬃcient statistics were obtained.

For each data run, the experimental signal is deter-
mined for two diﬀerent states of relative linear polariza-
tion of the excitation lasers. Although the absolute inten-
sities of these components depend on many experimental
factors, including the laser intensities, Cs density, and the
sensitivity of the detection electronics, the intensity ratio
is sensitive only to the relative polarization state of the
lasers and the two-photon matrix elements. The main
experimental observable for detailed analysis is then the
linear polarization degree deﬁned as

PL =

Sk − S⊥
Sk + S⊥

,

(1)

where Sk and S⊥ are the measured signal intensities
when the laser beams are linearly polarized collinearly or
perpendicularly, respectively.

The nuclear spin of 133Cs is I = 7/2, and so both the
6s 2S1/2 and 8s 2S1/2 electronic states have hyperﬁne
components of total angular momentum F = 3, 4. The
hyperﬁne splitting in the ground 6s 2S1/2 level is the
International Frequency Standard[37], which is approxi-
mately 9.192 GHz, while the hyperﬁne splitting in the 8s
2S1/2 level is about one-tenth this value and is on the or-
der of 0.9 GHz. Each of these splittings is larger than the
one-photon Doppler width of several hundred MHz asso-
ciated with the separate 6s 2S1/2 → 6p 2Pj and 6p 2Pj
→ 8s 2S1/2 transitions, and so partial resolution of the
hyperﬁne splitting is expected even when the two excita-
tion laser beams are copropagating through the sample
cell. This is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the

spectral and relative polarization dependence of the
two-photon excitation rate at ∆ = -80.37 cm−1. The
main contribution to the spectral width is due to Doppler

broadening, which is approximately double that for a
one-photon transition. On the other hand, for counter-
propagating beams, nearly complete cancellation of the
Doppler width is expected, with a residual two-photon
Doppler width ∼ 10 MHz. A typical such scan is shown
in Figure 4, which corresponds to the F = 4 → F’ = 4
transition with ∆ = -22.0 cm−1. There it is seen that
the spectral width of the line shape is approximately 40
MHz, which corresponds well to the combined residual
Doppler width and the spectral width of the Ti:Sapphire
laser. It is also seen that the excitation spectrum depends
signiﬁcantly on the relative polarization state of the two
laser beams, giving in this case a large linear polarization
degree of approximately 0.78.

In spite of the evidently good signal to noise ratio for
the data in Figure 4, it proved diﬃcult to achieve the
desired reproducibility in the polarization measurements
with the passively stabilized Ti:Sapphire laser. The main
reason for this was that measurement of the two diﬀerent
polarization states were made sequentially, and ﬂuctua-
tions in the laser frequency on the switching time scale
introduced unwanted noise in the extracted polarization
values. The reason for this is that when the lasers are
counterpropagating through the interaction region of the
cell, the Doppler width of the two-photon transition is
greatly reduced, and is on the order of the natural width
of the ﬁnal 8s level. In this case, in order to obtain reli-
able polarization measurements, the combined frequency
drift of the two lasers would need to be smaller than a
fraction of one MHz/s. Instead, we recorded the excita-
tion spectrum for copropagating laser beams, for which
the Doppler width is large (several hundred MHz), and
for which the characteristic laser frequency drift rates of
a few MHz/s are entirely acceptable. Note that variation
of the polarization in the few MHz range is totally neg-

ligible. The small penalty to be paid for this is that the
polarization values need to be determined in the wings
of the partially blended lines. However, these determina-
tions were made suﬃciently far into the wings that the
other hyperﬁne transition made nearly negligible contri-
bution to the polarization value. In addition, the signals
were signiﬁcantly less noisy than with counterpropagat-
ing beams, making possible consistent and repeatable
measurements of the polarization at each detuning. A
typical higher resolution data run is presented in Figure
5, which corresponds to the F = 4 → F’ = 3, 4 transitions
at ∆ = -167.9 cm−1.

Finally, we have modeled the residual eﬀect of blending
of the hyperﬁne lines on the measured polarization val-

ues. In the model, we approximate each hyperﬁne transi-
tion line shape to be Gaussian and having the measured
width determined by the Doppler broadening of the two-
photon transition. Using the known relative hyperﬁne
transition probabilities gives a polarization-dependent
correction that ranges from 0.0005 to 0.0013 (polariza-
tion values reported here can range from -1 to +1). Even
though these corrections are well within the statistical er-
ror associated with each measured polarization, the cor-
rections are systematic and so are made directly to the
measured counting rates, prior to extracting PL values
from the data through Eq. (1).

A. Analysis and Experimental Results

The variation of the linear polarization degree with de-
tuning ∆ of laser 1, and for each of the four electric-dipole
allowed hyperﬁne transitions, may be readily calculated
in terms of transition matrix elements (the general ex-
pression may be found in [35]). The dominant interme-
diate levels for the two-photon transitions are the 6p 2Pj
levels, with j = 1/2, 3/2, but other np 2Pj transitions,
including the p-continuum, also contribute to the total
transition probability, and play an important role in the
experiments reported here. For the transitions when ∆F
= ±1, absorption of two photons with collinear polariza-
tion directions is forbidden, and so the linear polarization
degree is -1, independent of detuning. However, for the
other transition pair, where ∆F = 0, both ﬁne struc-
ture multiplet components contribute, leading to strong
spectral variations in the linear polarization degree. The-
oretical expressions for the intensities are given by

case, these values are PL = 0.882 for the F = 4 → F’ = 4
transition, and PL = 0.811 for the F = 3 → F’ = 3 tran-
sition. In addition, there is a detuning from resonance
where the polarization is PL = - 1.0, corresponding to
the cases when the intensity Sk = 0 for each hyperﬁne
transition. The location of this point generally depends
on the four main terms in Eq. (2) - (8), and on the values
for P and Q.

Polarization measurements have been made in an ap-
proximately 200 cm−1 range of detunings to the low
frequency side of the atomic 6s 2S1/2 → 6p 2Pj res-
onance transition. These measurements, which have a
typical one standard-deviation uncertainty of 0.002, are
presented in Figure 7. The solid curves in this ﬁgure are
expanded versions of those in Figure 6. Note that the
error bars on the experimental data points are negligi-
ble on the scale of the ﬁgure. It can be seen from the
curves that there is signiﬁcant discrepancy between the
measurements and the theoretical curves (with P = 0,
Q = 0, and R = 2) for the F = 4 → F’ = 4 transition,
for which we have taken the most extensive data. At
the largest detuning, this amounts to about 20 standard
deviations. The departure has two main contributions,
these being the fact that nonresonant transitions with n
> 6 make a signiﬁcant contribution through nonzero val-
ues of P and Q, and because the value of R generally de-
parts from the nonrelativistic value of R = 2. In previous
work, the three parameters P, Q and R were considered
as constants, which is quite well justiﬁed by their weak
dependence on detuning. Fits to the detuning-dependent
polarization data then yielded linear relationships among
the parameters; estimates of P and Q further allowed
extraction of a quite precise value for the constant ma-
trix element ratio R. Although this is found to be in-
suﬃcient for the precision of the data presented here,
we report here our values, making the same assumptions

6

as in earlier work. That approach yields R=2.1068(36)
+ 443.2(1.2)P - 362(362)Q, where the uncertainty (in
parenthesis) in the numerical values represents one stan-
dard deviation. Note that although the coeﬃcient of Q
has an uncertainty on the order of its value, its value
is correlated with that of R and P, and so it cannot be
neglected. The ﬁnal uncertainty in R derived from calcu-
lated values of P and Q shows that the correction due to
Q is on the order of the uncertainty in R. This equation
represents the equivalent sum rule to those presented in
earlier reports on our measurements in Rb.

However, P and Q depend weakly on detuning, and so
to obtain the highest precision, it is desirable to calculate
P and Q as a function of detuning directly from the most
accurate experimental and theoretical matrix elements.
We use a combination of the most reliable experimental
and theoretical values for dominant contributions with
n ≤ 9. For n = 6, measured resonance line (n = 6)
matrix elements of Rafac, et al. [12] are employed, while
for the second resonance doublet (n = 7), we use the
recently reported precision measurements of Vasilyev et
al.
[13]. Other values having n ≤ 9 are obtained from
the relativistic all-order calculations of Safronova et al.
[30]; these are listed in Table 1. For multiplets with n
> 9, which make only a small overall contribution to R,
we use Dirac-Hartree-Fock matrix elements [28]; these
values are also summarized in Table 1, along with the
energies associated with each intermediate np level. For
reference, it is found that P and Q, calculated with these
values, are ﬁt very well by second order polynomials in
detuning ∆ = ω1 - ω10, and are given by P = -2.437 x
10−4 + 3.257 x 10−9∆ - 3.8847 x 10−12∆2 and by Q =
3.260 x 10−6 - 7.683 x 10−9∆ + 1.645 x 10−13∆2. The
detuning ∆ is in vacuum cm−1 units. We estimate the
total uncertainty in P and Q to be on the order of 1%.

To obtain the matrix element ratio deﬁned in Eq. (6), a
nonlinear least squares ﬁt of the polarization data of Fig.
7 is made to the theoretical expressions, using the calcu-
lated values of P and Q for each detuning. The result of
the ﬁt is R = 2.0024(24), where the dominant error in
R comes from the statistical uncertainty in the measured
polarization. The quality of the ﬁt is illustrated in Fig. 8.
In the ﬁgure, measurements are compared to the devia-
tion of the polarization from the values obtained when R
= 2, P = Q = 0; these are represented by the horizontal
line passing through zero deviation. The experimental
measurements, represented by the data points, are seen
to be in excellent agreement with the solid curve, this
being calculated from the ﬁtting parameters.

The ratio of excited-state dipole matrix elements
R8s−6p = <8skdk6p3/2>/<8skdk6p1/2> may be ob-
tained from Eq. (6) by combining the measured value
of R with the high precision 6p resonance line matrix
element ratio of 1.4074(3) measured by Rafac et al.
[11]. This gives the excited state matrix element ratio
of R8s−6p = 1.423(2), which has the uncertainty of about
0.15%, with roughly equal contributions from statistical
uncertainty in the measurements reported here and from

the resonance line matrix element ratio of [11]. Finally,
we point out that the analysis may be reversed, if it is
assumed that the bare transition matrix element ratio is
calculated precisely. Then, by recognizing that the oﬀ-
resonance terms represented by P and Q contribute an
average of about -0.1091(37) to the value of R, the mea-
surements determine the much smaller combination of
dipole matrix elements in Eqs. (7) - (8) to about 3 %.
As these terms are dominated by transitions through the
6s - 7p and 6s - 8p multiplets, the measurements serve as
a consistency check on existing measurements [13]at that
level.

III. RELATIVISTIC ALL-ORDER
CALCULATION OF TRANSITION MATRIX
ELEMENTS

In order to compare the experimental result R8s−6p =
1.423(2) with the high-precision theoretical value we
carry out relativistic all-order calculation of electric-
dipole matrix elements in Cs. In particular, we calculate
8s − np, n = 6, 7, 8, 9 electric-dipole reduced matrix
elements using a relativistic all-order method including
single and double (SD) excitations [28]. The resulting
values of the 8s − 7p, 8s − 8p, and 8s − 9p electric-dipole
matrix elements were used to determine P and Q.

In the SD all-order method, the wave function of the

valence electron v is represented as an expansion

In this equation |Φvi is the lowest-order atomic state
wave function, which is taken to be the frozen-core Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (DHF) wave function of a state v and a†
i
and ai are creation and annihilation operators, respec-
tively. The indices a, b designate core electrons and in-
dices m, n designate any states above the core. The
equations for excitations coeﬃcients ρma, ρmv, ρmnab,
and ρmnva are obtained by substituting the wave func-
tion Ψv into the many-body Schr¨odinger equation

H|Ψvi = E|Ψvi,

(11)

where H is the relativistic no-pair Hamiltonian [29]. The
equations are solved iteratively until the corresponding
correlation energy for the state v is suﬃciently converged.
The resulting excitation coeﬃcients are then used to cal-
culate matrix elements. The one-body matrix element of
the operator Z given by

Zwv =

hΨw|Z|Ψvi
hΨv|ΨvihΨw|Ψwi

.

is expressed in terms of excitation coeﬃcients as

p

Zwv =

zwv + Z (a) + · · · + Z (t)
(1 + Nv)(1 + Nw)

,

p

where zwv is the lowest-order DHF matrix element, the
terms Z k, k = a...t are linear or quadratic functions of
the excitation coeﬃcients, and normalization terms Nv
are quadratic functions of the excitation coeﬃcients. As
a result, certain sets of many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT) terms are summed to all orders. This method
is shown to yield high-accuracy results for the primary
transition electric-dipole matrix elements in alkali-metal
atoms [27, 29, 30]. The results for the reduced electric-
dipole matrix elements for 8s − 6p, 8s − 7p, 8s − 8p, and
8s − 9p transitions are listed in Table I.

Next, we investigate the eﬀect of the correlation to the
8s − 6p matrix elements to evaluate the uncertainty of
their ratio. We ﬁnd that the total correlation correction
to the 8s − 6p matrix elements is small, 3%. However, it
actually results from severe cancellations of large contri-
butions illustrated in Table II where we give the break-
down of the all-order SD calculation for both 8s − 6p
transitions. The lowest-order (DHF) value is listed in
the ﬁrst row of Table II. Three larger terms, Z (a), Z (c),

together as Zother. The total normalization correction
Znorm deﬁned as

Znorm = Zwv − [zwv + Z (a) + · · · + Z (t)]

(16)

is given separately. We ﬁnd that two dominant terms,
Z (c) and Z (d), nearly cancel each other and their sum
almost exactly cancels out the term Z (a).

We note that while terms Z (a) and Z (c) contain third-

8

(17)

order terms as well as higher-order terms (see [27] for
details) the Z (d) term, being quadratic in valence single-
excitation coeﬃcients ρmv contains only terms starting
from ﬁfth order. Out of the remaining terms, the largest
contribution comes from the normalization correction.
For these transitions, the dominant contribution to Nv(w)
in the denominator of Eq. (13) comes from the term

ρ∗
mvρmv.

m
X

This term contributes 97% to the N8s value and 64% to
the N6p value. Again, this term is quadratic in single
excitation coeﬃcients ρmv and can contain only MBPT
terms starting from ﬁfth order. Thus, 8s − 6p ma-
trix elements present an interesting case with large, but
canceling, contributions from high orders in many-body
perturbation theory. This cancellation occurs for both
8s − 6p1/2 and 8s − 6p3/2 matrix elements.

To evaluate the uncertainty in the theoretical ratio
R8s−6p we also calculate 8s − 6p3/2 and 8s − 6p1/2
electric-dipole matrix elements in diﬀerent approxima-
tions and estimate some omitted contributions. The
results are summarized in Table III. The lowest-order
DHF values are listed in column labeled DHF. The re-
sults of the third-order many-body perturbation-theory
calculation, which includes higher-order random-phase-
approximation terms as described in [31], are listed in col-
umn “III”. The third-order values, which include an esti-
mate of the omitted fourth- and higher-order Brueckner-
orbital (see classiﬁcation and formulas in [31]) correc-
tions obtained by the scaling procedure described in [31],
are listed in column “IIIsc”. Single-double all-order data
from Table I are listed in column “SD”. The results ob-
tained by including partial contribution of the triple exci-
tations are listed in column labeled “SDpT”. These data
are obtained by adding a triple-excitation valence term
to Eq. (10) and making corresponding corrections to cor-
relation energy and single-valence excitation coeﬃcient
equations ρmv as described in Refs. [27, 29, 30]. The ρmv
excitation coeﬃcients give rise to the largest terms, Z (c)
and Z (d), and the dominant part of Nv.

All-order SD and SDpT calculations include a com-
plete third-order contribution (see [27] for a detailed
comparison) but omit some classes of higher-order terms
starting from fourth order. We have estimated some
omitted correlation corrections resulting from triple and
higher excitations using the scaling described, for exam-
ple, in Ref. [29]. Brieﬂy, single-particle excitation coeﬃ-
cients ρmv are multiplied by the ratio of the experimental
and theoretical correlation energies. The modiﬁed exci-
tation coeﬃcients are then used to re-calculate matrix el-
ements. Such scaling estimates only certain classes of the
omitted contributions (mainly Brueckner-orbital contri-
butions, see Ref. [29] for classiﬁcation of the perturbation
theory terms). The corresponding SD and SDpT scaled
values are listed in columns “SDsc” and “SDpTsc”. Ab
initio and scaled values are grouped together.

The third-order matrix elements do not diﬀer signif-

9

sult of R = 1.423(2) shows excellent agreement. This
is remarkable, given the various contributing theoreti-
cal and experimental factors that signiﬁcantly aﬀect the
ﬁnal result in each case.
It is interesting to reiterate
that many of the two-photon transition matrix elements
in heavy alkali atoms show signiﬁcant relativistic mod-
iﬁcation. For example, the 5s 2S1/2 → 5p 2Pj → 5d
2D3/2 transition in Rb shows such variations at a level of
nearly 7 %. At the same time, other ratios, such as that
measured in the present case, show signiﬁcantly smaller
relativistic modiﬁcation, and yet in each case such modi-
ﬁcations are generally well-described by the highest-level
atomic structure calculations. Nevertheless, there is a
signiﬁcant sensitivity in the experimental measurements
to other dipole transitions, and these transitions depend
signiﬁcantly on relativistic contributions. Naturally, it
would be of interest to measure the absolute oscillator
strengths of the individual multiplet transitions, in order
to make direct comparison of the matrix element values
reported here. Such measurements remain a signiﬁcant
challenge to experimental technique. Finally, the excited
state transitions in atomic Cs associated with the 7p dou-
blet are of particular interest, as those second resonance
line matrix elements show nearly a factor of 2 departure
from the expected line strength ratio of 2.

In conclusion, we have used precision two-photon po-
larization spectroscopy to make measurements of the
transition matrix element ratio associated with the 6s
2S1/2 → np 2Pj → 8s 2S1/2 transition in atomic Cs.
The measurements are combined with other experimen-
tal data and calculations in order to extract the ratio of
excited-state matrix elements. The experimental value
is found to be in excellent agreement with the ratio of
reduced matrix elements calculated using a relativistic
all-order method.

icantly from the all-order results indicating very accu-
rate cancellation between large higher-order terms. The
Brueckner- orbital correction is dominant in a third-order
calculation for both transitions and is relatively more im-
portant for the 8s − 6p3/2 transition, thus giving a ratio
diﬀering from more accurate SD all-order value by 0.6%.
We note that the ratio of the scaled third-order values,
which includes an estimate of higher-order Brueckner-
orbital terms, agrees with the all-order result. As one
can see from Table III, the total correlation correction
contribution to the ratio R8s−6p is very small, 0.4%, ow-
ing to the cancellation of dominant terms. The diﬀerence
between all-order data in diﬀerent approximations is only
0.1%. As the largest contributions to these matrix ele-
ments contain valence single-excitation coeﬃcients ρmv
the inclusion of the partial triple contributions and the
scaling described above should give a good estimate of
the omitted higher-order terms as both these methods
are aimed at correcting ρmv. We recommend the SD
ab initio value R8s−6p = 1.425(2) as the ﬁnal theoreti-
cal value for the ratio. The uncertainty is obtained by
combining the uncertainty of the dominant terms, deter-
mined to be 0.1% based on the spread of SD, SDpT and
scaled values, and the total uncertainty in all other, much
smaller, contributions taken to be 0.1% not to exceed the
uncertainty of the dominant terms.

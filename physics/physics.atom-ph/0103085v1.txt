Abstract. We have constructed and modeled a simple and eﬃcient source of slow atoms. From a background
vapour loaded magneto-optical trap, a thin laser beam extracts a continuous jet of cold rubidium atoms.
In this setup, the extraction column that is typical to leaking MOT systems is created without any optical
parts placed inside the vacuum chamber. For detailed analysis, we present a simple 3D numerical simulation
of the atomic motion in the presence of multiple saturating laser ﬁelds combined with an inhomogeneous
−8 mbar, the moderate laser power of 10 mW per beam
magnetic ﬁeld. At a pressure of PRb87 = 1 × 10
generates a jet of ﬂux Φ = 1.3 × 108 atoms/s with a mean velocity of 14 m/s and a divergence of < 20 mrad.

1 Introduction

Experiments on trapped cold atom clouds require in most
cases high particle numbers and long trapping lifetimes. In
order to restrict the lifetime limiting collisions with back-
ground gas, an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment is
necessary. In turn, at these pressures a purely background
vapour charged magneto-optical trap (VCMOT) is limited
to very small atom numbers and long loading times and
thus needs to be loaded by an additional jet of cold atoms.
As to the simplest possible cold atom sources, a laser-
free velocity ﬁlter [1] is elegant, but its maximum ﬂux can
be greatly improved upon by adding a laser cooling stage.
The Zeeman slower is a widely used technique espe-
cially for light and thus thermally non capturable fast
species. For heavier elements, one can accumulate atoms
into a MOT in a vapour cell, with various strategies for
subsequent transfer to a recapture MOT in the UHV cell.
These strategies can be categorized into either a pulsed
[2,3] or continuous transfer scheme. The latter category
involves either a moving molasses [4] or a ’leaking MOT’
scheme [5,6].

This paper presents the construction and numerical
modeling of a cold atom jet whose ﬂux is continuous, ad-
justable in a given direction, and velocity tunable. The
device we present is based on an ordinary VCMOT. It
captures and cools atoms from the low velocity part of
the room temperature Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in
10−8 mbar. From the center of
a high pressure cell of P

this source MOT, an additional pushing beam of
1 mm
spot size extracts a continuous jet that is slow enough
to be recaptured in a MOT in the UHV region. The jet
passes through a tube that maintains the pressure diﬀer-
ential between the two cells, and the atom number transfer
between the two MOTs is found to be typically 50 % and
as high as 60 % eﬃcient.

∼

The Atom Faucet is closely related to the LVIS [5]
and the 2D+MOT [6]. The common concept which relates
them in the ’leaking MOT’ family is the creation of a thin
extraction column in the center of the MOT where the
radiation pressure is imbalanced and through which leaks
a continuous jet of cold atoms. Operation in a continu-
ous mode maximizes the mean ﬂux up to a value ideally
equal to the source trap capture rate. Since a leaking trap
operates at a low trap density, once captured, an atom
has much higher probability to leave the trap via the jet
rather than undergoing a collision that expels it.

The LVIS and 2D+MOT place a mirror inside the vac-
uum for retroreﬂection of one of the MOT beams. By
piercing a hole in this mirror, one creates a hollow retrore-
ﬂection beam, and the jet exits through the hole. By con-
trast, the Atom Faucet requires no optical parts inside the
vacuum system. Here, we superimpose an additional colli-
mated ’pushing beam’ that pierces the extraction column
through the MOT.

In these complex magneto-optical arrangements the
behavior of the system is no longer intuitively obvious.
On its way into the jet, a thermal atom undergoes sub-
sequent phases of strong radiation pressure (capture from
vapour), overdamped guidance to the magnetic ﬁeld min-
imum (MOT molasses) and 1D strong radiation pressure
with transverse 2D molasses cooling (extraction process).

Theoretical estimates for near-resonant atom traps con-
centrate either on the capture [7] or on the cooling [8].
We develop a simple and heuristic generalization of the
semiclassical radiation pressure expression for the case of
multiple saturating laser ﬁelds and inhomogeneous mag-
netic ﬁeld. The new approach of integrating the atomic
trajectory through both capture and cooling mechanisms
(neglecting optical pumping and particle interaction) re-
produces the parameter dependences of the Atom Faucet.
The trajectories indicate the physical mechanisms of the 7-
beam-interplay. However, the simpliﬁcations made to the
Rubidium level scheme lead to an overestimation of the
absolute value of the radiation pressure force and hence
an overestimate for the capture velocity of the MOT.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we
give details on the experimental realization of the Atom
Faucet. In section 3 we present the numerical model. Sec-
tion 4 discusses the parameter dependences of the device
in the experiment and in the simulations and ﬁnally in sec-
tion 5 we compare this scheme to other vapour cell cold
atom sources.

2 Experimental Realisation

The vacuum system consists of two glass cells separated
vertically by 67 cm with a MOT aligned at the center of
each cell. Using an appropriate pumping scheme and a
diﬀerential pumping tube of diameter 5 mm and length
15 cm the pressure in the lower recapture cell is less than
10−8 mbar. We
10−11 mbar while in the source cell it is
deduce the 87Rb pressure in the source cell from the reso-
nant absorption of a multi-passed probe beam. A heated
reservoir connected to the upper source cell supplies the
Rubidium vapour.

A grating stabilized diode laser locked to the

transition injects into three slave
lasers, two for the source MOT and one for the recapture
MOT. The Atom Faucet (see ﬁg. 1) is based on a standard
MOT conﬁguration: two Anti-Helmholtz-coils maintain a
magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 15 G/cm along their axis, which
is horizontal in this setup. A pair of axial beams with pos-
itive helicity counterpropagate along the axis of the coils
and two mutually orthogonal pairs of radial beams with
negative helicity counterpropagate in the symmetry plane
of the coils. The radial beams are inclined by 45◦. The ra-
dial trap beams have an 8 mm spot size and the axial beam
11 mm respectively, all clipped to a diameter of 1 inch by
our quarterwaveplates. The axial beam carries 20 mW be-
fore retroreﬂection, and the radial beams each have 5 mW
each before retroreﬂection. The repumping light on the
transition from an inde-

beam and has a power of

In addition to these trapping lasers, a permanent push-
ing beam on the

sition with linear polarization [9] and optimal power of

a waist of 90 µm 30 cm before entering the source cell such
that it diverges to a size of 1.1 mm at the source trap and

the source MOT and detuning are comparable to those of
the MOT beams and hence its radiation pressure is also
comparable with the trapping forces in the MOT. Because
of the divergence of the pushing beam, the intensity in the
lower MOT is lower by a factor of 10. It decenters the re-
capture MOT by
1 mm but does not destabilize it. Note
that the pushing beam carries no repumping light, so that
it acts on the atoms only where it intersects the MOT
beams.

By studying the loading characteristics of the recap-
ture MOT, we deduce the main features of the atom jet:

– When the recapture MOT is empty the initial recap-
ture rate gives directly the recaptured ﬂux since the
density dependent intrinsic losses in the MOT are not
yet important. The absolute number of atoms is deter-
mined using an absorption imaging technique.

– The time dependence of the recapture loading rate pro-
vides a measurement of the longitudinal velocity dis-
tribution of the jet. More precisely, by suddenly disin-
jecting the source MOT slave lasers and then recording
the recapture ﬁlling rate via the ﬂuorescence, the char-
acteristics of the tail of the moving extraction column

For the determination of the transfer eﬃciency, the
loading rate of the source MOT is determined by its ﬂuo-
rescence and compared with the measured recapture ﬂux.
The ﬂuorescence measurement is done at resonance and
we assume full saturation of the transition under the in-
ﬂuence of all six laser beams and thus a photon scattering
rate of Γ/2 photons/atom/second.

We observe a typical transfer eﬃciency of 50 % (see
below). Since the radius of the recapture MOT beams is
r = 5 mm and the transfer distance is D = 67 cm, less than
50 % of the atoms are emitted with a divergence larger
than r/D

10 mrad.

3 Theoretical Description for Numerics

In order to model both the capture of the atoms from
the vapor into the source MOT and the subsequent cool-
ing and pushing processes, we have developed a numeri-
cal simulation which integrates the equation of motion for
atoms chosen with random initial positions and velocities.
We describe the atomic motion using classical dynamics.
The action of the seven laser beams (6 MOT beams + 1
pushing beam) on an atom located at r with velocity v
is taken into account through an average radiation force
F(r, v). We neglect any heating or diﬀusion caused by
spontaneous emission.

The calculation of the semi-classical force acting on an
atom in this multiple beam conﬁguration is a priori very

and where Im is the intensity of the laser wave driving
transition. We can sum up the three forces
the
associated with the three possible transitions, each calcu-
lated with the proper detuning taking into account the
Zeeman eﬀect.

Still working in the low intensity limit, we can gener-
alize eq. (2) to the case where N laser beams with wave
vectors kj and detunings δj, (j = 1, ..., N ) are present.

Note that in establishing eq. (3) we have taken the
spatial average of the radiative force over a cell of size
λ = 2π/k, neglecting thus all interference terms varying
r. We therefore neglect any eﬀect of the
as i(kj −
dipole force associated with the light intensity gradients
on the wavelength scale. This is justiﬁed in the case of a
leaking MOT since the associated dipole potential wells
are much less deep than the expected residual energy of
the atoms before extraction.

At the center of the capture MOT, we can no longer
neglect inter-beam saturation eﬀects since the saturation
parameter for each of the 7 beams is equally
1/7. In
principle, accounting for this saturation eﬀect requires a
step-by-step numerical integration of the 16 coupled Bloch
optical equations (for a
transi-
g, Jg = 0
|
tion), as the atom moves in the total electric ﬁeld result-
ing from the interference of all the laser beams present in
the experiment. Such a calculation is unfortunately much
too computationally intensive to lead to interesting pre-
dictions for our Atom Faucet in a reasonable time. We
therefore decided to turn to a heuristic and approximate
expression for the force, demanding:

e, Je = 1

i

– In the case of a single traveling wave, σ± polarized
along the magnetic ﬁeld, we should recover expression
(1).

– In the low intensity limit, the force should simplify to

expression (3).

– The magnitude of the force should never exceed ¯hk Γ/2,
which is the maximal radiation pressure force in a sin-
gle plane wave.

There are of course an inﬁnite number of expressions which
fulﬁll these three conditions. We have taken the simplest
one:

with partial saturation parameters sj,m as deﬁned in eq.
(3). This equation is the generalization of the heuristic
expression used by Phillips and co-workers [8] to account
for saturation eﬀects in an optical molasses.

In the simulation, the MOT beams are chosen to have
Gaussian proﬁles truncated to the diameter of the quar-
terwaveplates. Also they are chosen to be equally strong
with a central intensity of 5 Isat and to have the proper
polarizations and directions. The pushing beam’s intensity
is of the same order. We assume that because of optical
pumping into the lower hyperﬁne ground state, an atom
sees no forces when it is out of the repumper light mixed
in the axial beams. Finally, the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld
is B(x) = b′(

2x, y, z).

In the simulation the initial position of each atom is
chosen on one of the cell windows following a uniform spa-
tial distribution. The initial velocity is given by a Maxwell
Boltzmann distribution for T = 300 K. The trajectory is
then integrated using a Runge-Kutta method. From these
trajectories (see ﬁg. 3), one obtains a probability for an
atom to be captured and transferred into the jet, as well as
the jet’s characteristics: velocity distribution, divergence,
and total ﬂux. The absolute ﬂux of the simulated jet is cal-
ibrated using the real number of atoms emitted per unit
time and per unit surface of the cell at a pressure P which
is P/√2πmkBT [11,12].

The simulation neglects interaction eﬀects like colli-
sions and multiple light scattering. The validity of the lin-
ear scaling with pressure is limited to the low pressure
regime (P < 10−7 mbar) where the characteristic extrac-
tion time of
20 ms is shorter than the collision time,
which is in turn of the order of the trap lifetime.

4 Results

Inspecting qualitatively the trajectories, we ﬁnd that an
atom that enters the beam intersection is ﬁrst decelerated
by radiation pressure on a distance much smaller than the
trapping beam radius. It then slowly moves to the center
of the trap where it enters the extraction column. The ﬁnal
transverse cooling of the jet takes place during extraction,
so that the divergence of the jet grows if the extraction
happens too fast. We believe that this is the principal loss
mechanism of any leaking MOT system, which have in
common an extraction column and a transverse molasses
provided by the trapping beams.

4.1 Total Flux

For a typical choice of parameters, the simulation ﬁnds
90 % transfer from the source MOT through the diﬀeren-
tial pumping tube to the recapture MOT. The remaining
10 % of the atoms leave the source at a divergence too large
to be recaptured and are lost. Experimentally, we have
10 %. This
achieved a transfer eﬃciency of at most 60
value is most probably limited by the diﬀerential pumping
tube diameter.

estimates vc by (13/2.5)1/4

normalize the absolute value of the ﬂux and concentrate
on its variation with system parameters.

Simulated VCMOT Optimisation. Using the simulation
of a pure MOT without pushing beam, we can readily ﬁnd
the parameters which optimise the capture rate from the
background vapour. The total laser power is taken to be
20 mW, equally distributed among three beams which are

then retroreﬂected. We calculate an optimal detuning of
3 Γ . The capture rate is divided by more than 2 when the
−
detuning is beyond
1.5 Γ . This is
the typical MOT operation range. The magnetic gradient
seems to have little inﬂuence as long as it is between 8
and 20 G/cm.

4.5 Γ or smaller than

−

−

It is particularly helpful to calculate the optimal beam
waist for a given laser power since in the optical setup this
parameter is tiresome to change and demands subsequent
trap realignment. In our case, a 9 mm spot size gives the
best simulated capture rate, with half maximum values at
4 mm and 16 mm. For a ﬁxed laser power, having a large
intersection volume is preferable to increasing the satura-
tion beyond
4 Isat. The experiment uses an 8 mm spot
size, and the optimum parameters do not change signiﬁ-
cantly if the retroreﬂection loss of 20 % is included. Finally,
the simulation reproduces the smoothly decreasing slope
of the capture rate versus the MOT beam power of ref [7].

∼

4.2 Pushing Beam Parameters

We now add the thin pushing beam to the MOT light ﬁeld.
Doing so does not modify the optimal parameters of the
capture MOT, neither in experiment nor in the simulation.
Remember that the volume aﬀected by the thin beam is
very small compared to the total capture volume of the
source MOT. We investigate the inﬂuence of pushing beam
power, detuning, and size on the atomic jet emerging from
the MOT. The following discussion shall directly combine
experimental ﬁndings and the results from the theoretical
model.

Power. For very low pushing beam power the trap is de-
centered but not yet leaking. At Ppush = 80 µW (cor-
responding to a pushing beam intensity 1/4 of a MOT
beam intensity), the ﬂux increases sharply and then falls
oﬀ with increasing power (see ﬁg. 5). The simulation pre-
dicts exactly the same critical power, without adjustable
parameters (see ﬁg. 5). The decrease at higher power can
be understood if one examines the simulated divergence
of the atomic jet, which grows with increasing pushing
beam power. This eﬀect is attributed to an insuﬃcient
short transverse cooling time due to the strong acceler-
ation (see discussion below). Experimentally the jet ve-
locity is deduced from measurements like ﬁg. 2. With in-
creasing pushing beam power it grows from 12 to 15 m/s
with an average width of 10 m/s. In the simulation, we
ﬁnd a smaller width of 1 m/s. This discrepancy is proba-
bly due to the fact that we have completely neglected the
heating due to spontaneous emission. The longitudinal ve-
locity width is larger than that of the LVIS or 2D MOT;
however, for the purpose of loading a recapture MOT the
velocity width does not matter.

Detuning. The complex behaviour of the ﬂux on the push-
ing beam detuning (δpush) is qualitatively very well repro-
duced by the simulation (see ﬁgs. 6 and 7). If the pushing

Complementary Numerical Study: Waist. With a very
small pushing beam size < 0.4 mm atoms drift out of the
extraction column and are decelerated. They are recycled
forever or leave the trap with high divergence. For a large
spot size of > 1.5 mm atoms are not all extracted from the
center and so many are not cooled suﬃciently transversely.
Both cases induce losses.

5 Comparison and Conclusion

Certainly, there are other techniques for the directed trans-
fer of cold atoms from a VCMOT into a jet. A moving
molasses launch [2] provides a rather cold beam but low
ﬂux. A pulsed MOT launched by a resonant beam push is
heated in the absence of transverse cooling beams [3]. Dur-
√1000 photons are spontaneously emit-
ing the launch
ted into the transverse plane, while in continuous schemes
there is transverse cooling during extraction. As a result

beam detuning is negative and exceeds the MOT beam

yet leaking. Remember that the intensity of the pushing
beam is about the same as for the MOT beams, so that
as the detuning is increased the pushing radiation pres-
sures becomes weaker than the trapping pressure. With
zero or small blue detuning, atoms are resonantly acceler-
ated, and their extraction is too fast to allow for eﬃcient
transverse cooling. These atoms leave at high divergence
and are lost. Generally the simulation ﬁnds a 1 : 1 cor-
relation of extraction time (ﬂight time
10 ms from the
center of the trap to the depumping region) with diver-
gence. Clearly, transverse cooling takes a certain time, and
if the extraction acceleration is too strong, losses due to a
high beam divergence are inevitable.

12. In order to increase the eﬃciency of the simulation we
only evolve atoms with an initial velocity lower than
vmax = 45 m/s. We checked that atoms with a larger veloc-
ity cannot be captured in the MOT, whatever the direction
of their initial velocity.

there is then no need for magnetic guiding [13], to achieve
an elevated transfer eﬃciency.

Continuous schemes suﬀer less from interparticle in-
teractions, since the steady state source cloud stays small.
Leaking MOTs therefore accumulate atoms with the ini-
tial capture rate of the MOT. The Atom Faucet provides
a 50 % transfer eﬃciency from ﬁrst capture, through the
diﬀerential pumping tube, and to a recapture MOT in an
UHV cell. It creates an extraction column that is typical of
leaking MOT systems with a ﬂexible design and without
optical parts inside the vacuum chamber.

The ﬂux of Φ = 1

108 atoms/s at a background
10−9 mbar is equal to
vapour pressure of PRb87 = 7.6
that of the low power version of the LVIS in [6] and su-
perior to the 2D+ MOT in this pressure region. The later
design in turn provides very high ﬂux at high pressure,
since it minimizes the source trap density. We did not
explore pressures that were incompatible with the UHV
requirements in our recapture cell and found no devia-
tion from the linear scaling of the ﬂux with pressure up to
10−8 mbar. Essentially, the Atom Faucet
pressures of 4
transplants to a MOT at 10−11 mbar the loading rate of a
MOT at few 10−8 mbar.

We have also presented a 3D simulation of the atomic
motion in multiple laser ﬁelds with an inhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld, neglecting interactions and ﬂuctuations.
We ﬁnd that the transverse cooling inside the extraction
column turns out to be a crucial element for the satis-
factory performance of leaking MOT atom sources. Our
simulation overestimates the capture rate, but predicts
well the measured parameter dependences. Moreover, it is
readily adapted to an arbitrary laser and B-ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration.

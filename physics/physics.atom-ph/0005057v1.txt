Branching fractions were measured for electric dipole transitions from the 5p upper levels to the
5s levels in neutral krypton atoms. The measurements were made with a wall-stabilized electric
arc and a 2m monochromator for the spectral lines in the visible, and with a hollow cathode
lamp and the NIST 2m–Fourier transform spectrometer for the lines in the near infrared. A
semi-empirical calculation, based on accurately known lifetimes for six upper levels, was used to
calculate lifetimes for which accurate measurements do not exist. This resulted in a complete set
of lifetimes for all 5p levels. Branching fractions and lifetimes were used to calculate transition
rates for the 5p–5s transitions. The relative uncertainties of the transition rates range from less
than 1% for the strongest lines to about 10% for the weakest lines. Our data also reveal that most
of the previous measurements appear to have been aﬀected by opacity eﬀects in the light sources.

1 Introduction

The transitions from the 5p levels to 5s levels in neutral Kr give rise to the most prominent lines in
the Kr I emission spectrum (see Fig. 1 for a simpliﬁed energy level diagram). Lifetimes with sub-percent
uncertainties for six of the ten 5p levels have recently been measured with beam-gas laser spectroscopy
(BGLS) by Schmoranzer and Volz [1] and Schmitt et al. [2]. We will show below how the six lifetimes from
BGLS can be used in an intermediate coupling calculation to predict accurately the lifetimes of those four
levels that were not accessible to BGLS. The resulting complete set of lifetimes for the 5p levels inspired
us to make new, accurate measurements of branching fractions for all 5p–5s transitions in Kr I to obtain
electric dipole transition rates with uncertainties limited only by the accuracy of the radiometric calibration.
To date, the most extensive measurements of transition rates in Kr I were carried out by Chang,
Horiguchi and Setser [3] who have measured transition rates for all 5p–5s transitions but with an accuracy of
only 30%. Similar measurements were made by Fonseca and Campos [4, 5] who used a low-pressure spectral
lamp as an excitation source and lifetimes measured in an electron excitation experiment for absolute
measurements of transition rates. A number of other experiments used thermal plasma sources, either wall-
stabilized electric arcs in the experiments by Ernst and Schulz–Gulde [6] and Brandt, Helbig and Nick [7]
or a shock-tube in the experiment by Kaschek, Ernst and B¨otticher [8]. These experiments depended on
plasma diagnostics and the transition rates have relative uncertainties that are generally not much better
than ±10% even for strong transitions.

2 Upper level lifetimes

The lifetimes of six of the ten 5p upper levels are known with relative standard uncertainties of the order of
0.2% or better from recent beam-gas-laser spectroscopy (BGLS) measurements by Schmitt et al. [2]. Our
primary purpose here is to ﬁnd reliable estimates for the lifetimes of the remaining four 5p levels. We will
do this with a semi-empirical theoretical approach that is based upon intermediate coupling theory.
In
addition, we have evaluated the published experimental data to have an alternate set of lifetimes. Although
these lifetimes are less accurate than the semi-empirical ones they provide bounds for the semi-empirical
lifetimes.

2.1 Experimental lifetimes

A comparison with the six reference lifetimes from BGLS [2] divides the experimental data sets from litera-
ture in two classes of diﬀerent reliability. The results from experiments employing selective laser excitation
[3, 13, 14] and from the only wall-stabilized arc emission experiment [6] carried out so far generally fall (with
a few explainable exceptions) into a ±8% tolerance band around the six reference lifetimes (see Table 1).
The pulsed-laser lifetime measurements encountered some problems for the closely-spaced levels 2p8 and
2p9 due to fast collisional mixing that resulted in non-exponential decay curves. Apart from these two
levels the results agree within ±8% with the BGLS lifetimes. A tendency towards underestimated error
bars, however, is obvious for all three experiments. The lifetimes resulting from the arc emission experiment
[6] also agree within ±8% with the BGLS results despite of an uncertainty of ±30% the authors quote for
their absolute intensity scale. The exception here is the level 2p9 for which saturation problems were not
adequately treated.

These measurements (summarized in Table 1) are the best measured lifetimes for the remaining
four 5p levels. The estimated relative uncertainties are around ±8%. Other experiments which employed
pulsed electron excitation [15, 16, 5] or the Hanle eﬀect [17, 18, 19, 20] all have produced at least one result
far outside of the ±8% tolerance range and will therefore not be considered further.

2.2 Semi-empirical lifetimes

The 5p levels in krypton decay exclusively (apart from some very weak far-IR channels for the four highest 5p
levels) through the transitions of the 5p–5s array. In a typical semi-empirical calculation for this transition
array (e.g. Lilly [21], see column CA in Table 2) the wavefunctions of the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgurations
γ =4p55p and γ ′ =4p55s in intermediate coupling are expressed in terms of LS-coupled wavefunctions
|γLSJM >:

|i, JM > = XLS |γLSJM > a(γLSJ, i)
|f, J ′M ′ > = XL′S ′ |γL′S ′J ′M ′ > a(γ ′L′S ′J ′, f )

(1)

(2)

(i and f denote the coupled initial and ﬁnal states). The mixing co¨eﬃcients a(γLSJ,·) can be determined
from experimental energies with a semi-empirical ﬁt procedure in the manner described by Lilly [21]. Once
the mixing coeﬃcients have been determined, the reduced dipole matrix elements < i||D||f >, which are
proportional to the transition rates Aif , may be expressed in terms of the reduced matrix elements in
LS-coupling. The latter can be reduced further, using angular momentum theory, to

< γLSJ||D||γ ′L′S ′J ′ >= δSS ′(2J + 1)1/2(2J ′ + 1)1/2(−1)L+1+S+J ′(cid:26) SLJ

1J ′L′(cid:27) < γLS||D||γ ′L′S ′ > .

(3)

2

In the single electron (or Coulomb) approximation the reduced dipole matrix element is proportional to the
dipole transition moment σγγ ′:

< γLS||D||γ ′L′S ′ >= (2L + 1)1/2 σγγ ′
σγγ ′ = √3Z ∞

u5p(r) er u5s(r) dr

0

(4)

(5)

where

When we use the transition moment σγγ ′ = 3.04 a.u.

and u5p(r), u5s(r) are the radial wavefunctions of the valence electron. In this simple semi-empirical model
the relative transition rates, and thus the lifetime ratios, depend on the intermediate coupling coeﬃcients
a(γLSJ,·) of the 5p and 5s conﬁgurations, and the absolute scale is given by one single transition moment
σγγ ′ for the entire 5p–5s transition array.
that was obtained in the semi-empirical
calculation by Lilly [21] we ﬁnd that, on average, the six experimental BGLS lifetimes can be reproduced
no better than within 7%. The predictions from this semi-empirical model for the remaining lifetimes are
presumably not more accurate than the recommended experimental values are (see Table 1). It appears
unlikely that the mixing coeﬃcients of the 5s and 5p conﬁgurations are responsible for the lesser accuracy of
the semi-empirical lifetimes since the reproduction of the experimental energies by the semi-empirical inter-
mediate coupling method is quite good [21]. The problem is the assumption of one single transition moment
σγγ ′ for the entire transition array. To reﬁne the semi-empirical model, we assumed LS-dependent transi-
tion moments σγγ ′(L, S, L′, S ′) which correspond to LS-dependent radial functions u5p(LS) and u5s(L′S ′)
in Eq. 5. These are similar to those used, for example, in Hartree-Fock calculations. We further assumed
that spin-orbit interaction only results in a mixture of LS-terms but not in a modiﬁcation of the radial
wavefunctions. Since a calculation of these transition moments from ﬁrst principles or from experimental
energies would not have been accurate enough for our purposes we determined the transition moments from
the six reference lifetimes from BGLS.

In total six diﬀerent non-zero transition moments are needed for the description of the 5p-5s array.
They correspond to the six allowed transitions in LS-coupling (see Table 3). In one case, for the transition
5p 3D → 5s 3P, the transition moment may be calculated directly from the lifetime of the level 2p9 since both
the initial (3D3) and the ﬁnal state (3P2) of the only decay channel are pure states in LS-coupling. Generally,
the transition moments have to be determined by means of a nonlinear least-squares ﬁt procedure that
adjusts the transition moments so as to get best agreement of the calculated lifetimes with the six reference
lifetimes from BGLS. The results are summarized in Table 3. The quoted standard uncertainties of the semi-
empirical transition moments and lifetimes were obtained by Gaussian propagation of the uncertainties of
the reference lifetimes, the uncertainties in the energy parameters (see [21]), and the uncertainties of the
contributing branching ratios.

The energy matrices and the intermediate coupling coeﬃcients of the 5p and 5s conﬁgurations (see
Table 2) were recalculated from the Slater- and spin-orbit parameters (including the αL(L + 1) correction)
given by Lilly [21]. The six reference states (2p3,4,6..9) for which the lifetimes are known very accurately are
mostly built from the four LS-terms 1P, 1D, 3P, and 3D. The four corresponding transition moments could
thus be deduced with high accuracy (see Table 3). The transition moment of the transition 5p 3S → 5s 3P
was determined with a somewhat greater uncertainty from the lifetime of the 2p3 state. This state is the
only one in the set of reference states that contains a relevant contribution (16%) from the 3S term. The 1S
term only contributes to the states 2p1 and 2p5 which are not included in the set of reference states. For the
determination of the transition moment of the transition 5p 1S → 5s 1P we resorted to branching fractions
as additional criteria. Particularly, we used branching fractions of the weak decay channels 2p1 → 1s4 and
2p5 → 1s2 which are sensitive to the transition moment sought after. The dependence of the branching
fractions for these transitions and the upper level lifetimes on the transition moment is shown in ﬁgure
Fig. 3. The attainable accuracy for the transition moment, however, is limited by the uncertainty in the
branching fractions.

3

As a last technical detail we note that for the four highest 5p levels (2p1 . . . 2p4) there are weak
far-IR decay channels to states of the 4d conﬁguration which have to be accounted for. For this purpose
we used the theoretical transition rates calculated by Aymar and Coulombe [23]. Because of the huge
discrepancies between length- and velocity-form results for the 5p–4d transition rates we used the greater
velocity-form results with a pessimistic uncertainty estimate of ±100% (see Table 2).
The uncertainties of the four semi-empirical lifetimes (see Table 2) for the states 2p1, 2p2, 2p5, and
2p10 vary between 0.1% and 3.7% depending on the LS-terms they are built from. The 2p2 state allows for
a very precise lifetime calculation because it relates to the four accurately determined transition moments
only. The lifetime predictions for the other three levels are less accurate because they include signiﬁcant
contributions from the two less accurate transition moments. Our semi-empirical predictions agree very well
with the best previous experimental values (see column BE in Table 1) but they are of superior accuracy
and we used them for the normalization of our transition rates.

3 Branching fractions

The measurement of branching fractions for the transition from 5p levels presents a formidable task owing
to the metastable nature of the lower 5s and 5s′ levels (see Fig. 1) which may render the lamp discharge
column optically thick for transitions to those levels. We have measured branching fractions for 30 lines
arising from 5p levels in the wavelength range from 556.2 nm to 1878.5 nm in two separate experiments.
The spectral lines in the visible part of the Kr I spectrum were measured in air with a wall-stabilized arc
discharge and a 2m – Czerny-Turner monochromator. The infrared portion of the spectrum was measured
with a hollow-cathode lamp and the NIST 2m – Fourier transform spectrometer. The comparison of the
results from the two diﬀerent experiments made it easier for us to notice systematic errors due to optically
thick transitions in the light sources. The four 5p′ – 4d transitions (see Fig. 1) near 10000 nm were outside
the range of either experiment.

3.1 Wall-stabilized arc measurements

The experimental setup for the measurements is shown schematically in Fig. 2. In our experiment we used
the wall-stabilized arc previously described in detail by Musielok et al. [9]. The space near the electrodes
was operated in argon while the midsection of the arc channel contained helium with a small admixture of
krypton. The fraction of krypton in helium was maintained below 0.3% to avoid self-absorption of krypton
lines. The arc was operated at a current of 50 A. To check for optical thickness, the krypton spectra were
measured with varying amounts of krypton in the discharge.

When the wall-stabilized arc is operated in helium, spectral lines remain narrow and continuum
emission is low because of the low electron density in a helium arc. This facilitates more accurate line
intensity measurements because spectral lines are well isolated and the ratio of line to continuum intensity
is high. It was not necessary to achieve LTE conditions in the arc plasma, because we were only interested
in the measurement of branching ratios of spectral lines. The measurements were performed in a side-on
conﬁguration to avoid interloping argon lines and argon plasma continuum radiation that are emitted at the
ends of the arc. As indicated in Fig. 2, either the wall–stabilized arc or a tungsten strip standard lamp were
imaged onto the entrance slit of a 2 m Czerny–Turner monochromator by a concave mirror with a magniﬁ-
cation factor of approximately 1.3. A beam splitter was placed in the beam path to reﬂect a fraction of the
light into the 0.25 m monochromator that was used to monitor the discharge stability. This monochromator
was set to the 760.2 nm line of Kr I. The total intensity of this line was measured with a photomultiplier
tube and a chart recorder and showed less than 1% ﬂuctuation during our measurements. The krypton
spectra were recorded with a CCD camera that was mounted at the exit plane of the monochromator. The
measured spectral line proﬁles were ﬁrst corrected for the spectral response of the experimental system,
as determined with the standard lamp, and the residual continuum was subtracted. The lines were then

4

integrated by ﬁtting a spline function to the data using a program package published by Renka[10] which
yields the integral of the spectral line without requiring that the apparatus function be known analytically.

3.2 Hollow cathode lamp measurements

The experiment described in the previous section was unsuited for measurements in the infrared because
it was set up in air. A second experiment in a purged environment was therefore carried out to measure
the intensity of lines in the infrared. This used a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to observe
spectra of a hollow cathode lamp.

The high-current hollow cathode lamp we used was developed by Danzmann et al. [11]. For our
measurements it was equipped with a cathode made of oxygen-free copper which is easy to operate and has
no lines that blend with the krypton lines of interest. The hollow cathode lamp was operated with between
130 Pa and 250 Pa of argon or neon as a carrier gas for the discharge with an admixture of between 0.5 Pa
and 10 Pa. The discharge current was varied between 100 mA and 500 mA. The experimental setup was
similar to the one used with the wall-stabilized arc. The entire imaging system was enclosed in a purge box
that was continuously purged with water vapor and carbon dioxide free air to suppress absorption by these
gases in the near infrared.

Many lines were strongly self-absorbed when pure krypton was used as a carrier gas in the hollow
cathode lamp discharge. This problem was partly overcome when the partial pressure of krypton in the
discharge was reduced by using a neon-krypton mixture in the hollow cathode lamp. We also found that the
spectra obtained with high currents where the copper density in the discharge is high show self absorption
only in the very strongest lines. We assume that the metastable 5s states were depopulated by charge-transfer
collisions with copper atoms in the hollow cathode lamp discharge.

The NIST 2m – Fourier transform spectrometer (described in Nave et al. [12]) was used to measure
the spectra of the hollow cathode lamp and the standard lamp. A resolution of around 0.01 cm−1 was used for
the measurements of the krypton spectra. For the near IR region, a liquid nitrogen cooled indium-antimonide
detector was used whereas silicon photodiodes were used to record spectra below 1000 nm. To improve the
signal-to-noise ratio, colored glass ﬁlters were employed to restrict the bandpass of the spectrometer to the
wavenumber range of interest. The spectral sensitivity of the optical and detection systems was calibrated
with the standard lamp before and after measurements of the spectra of the light from the hollow cathode
discharge. Some residual self-absorption was evident for the strongest lines even at low krypton partial
pressures. For those lines we relied on the results from the experiment with the wall-stabilized arc, where
these lines remained optically thin.

3.3 Data analysis and uncertainties

It is common that the the uncertainty of experimental transition rates is limited by the uncertainty of the
measurement of the upper level lifetimes and not by the uncertainty of the branching fraction measurement.
In our case, the situation is reversed. The uncertainty of the branching fraction measurement is limited
by the uncertainty of the radiometric calibration which is around 2%. The uncertainties of the upper level
lifetimes are generally much lower. In this section we will describe in detail how the uncertainties for the
branching fractions were calculated.

The transition rate Aki of a transition from a particular upper level k to lower level i can be
calculated from a measurement of the upper level lifetime τk and a measurement of the branching fraction
Fki – the fraction that the transition to i contributes to the total decay rate:

Aki =

Fki, where Fki =

where the sum is over all the lower levels to which the upper level can decay.

Several independent measurements of the Kr I spectrum were made with diﬀerent operating condi-
ki of each spectral line in each measured spectrum
ki and the relative eﬃciency of the spectrometer ǫ(σ) at the

tions for the hollow cathode lamp. The relative intensity ˆI α

(8)

where the relative eﬃciency of the optical system was assumed to be constant over the width of the spectral
line. These intensities were then divided by a normalizing factor ˆI α
norm to put all the intensities in all spectra
on the same relative intensity scale. This normalizing factor was usually chosen such that the intensity of
one strong line common to all spectra was 1, hence making the intensities relative with respect to that strong
line. This approach was found to be more reliable than using a weighted mean of the intensities, as lines in
some of the spectra may be aﬀected by self-absorption, or be too weak to be measured. The weighted mean
relative intensity of the line ¯Iki was then found using:

¯Iki =

ki Xα

Pα wα

ˆI α

ˆI α

(9)

where wα
ki is a weighting factor. The weighting factor chosen for the hollow cathode measurements was the
signal-to-noise ratio of the line. The small uncertainty of the normalization line intensity is due to its high
signal-to-noise ratio. These branching ratios are converted to branching fractions and transition rates using
equations 6 and 7.

Absolute transition rates are then determined from the mean values of between 5 and 9 independent
measurements of the relative intensities and experimental lifetime data. They are presented in table 4, along
with the lifetimes of the upper levels used to determine the transition rates. The uncertainties given in the
table result from the estimated standard deviation of the branching fractions and the uncertainty of the
lifetime data. The estimated standard deviation of the branching fractions depends on the uncertainty in
the weighted mean relative intensity, which in turn depends on the individual measurements of the intensity
through equation 9, and the uncertainty in the radiometric calibration of the spectrometer.

The estimated uncertainty in the individual measurements of the intensity was taken as the intensity
divided by the signal-to-noise ratio: ˆI α
ki. When photon noise is the dominant source of uncertainty, the
square of the signal-to-noise ratio must be used as the weighting factor in equation 9. We chose to weight
the individual intensity measurements with the signal-to-noise ratio to account for a signiﬁcant systematic
component in the uncertainty which may result from self-absorption or line blends.

ki/wα

The statistical component in the uncertainty of the weighted mean relative intensity ustat( ˆIki) can

then be derived by applying the law of propagation of uncertainty to equation 9:

ustat( ¯Iki) = vuutXα   ˆI α

ki

norm ·
ˆI α

ki!2

where the sum is again over all the observations of the lines. This must be added in quadrature to the
uncertainty in the radiometric calibration of the spectrometer, which was estimated at 3.3% for one standard
deviation. This estimate includes the uncertainty in the supplied calibration of the standard lamp (1.5%
for one standard deviation) and a contribution of 3% for the measurement of the standard lamp spectrum.
The total uncertainty in the measurement of the weighted mean relative intensities is thus:

u( ¯Iki) = qu2

stat( ¯Iki) + (0.033 ¯Iki)2

(10)

The uncertainty in the measurement of the branching fractions u(Fki) is derived by applying the law of
propagation of uncertainty to equation 7 to give:

This is combined in quadrature with the uncertainty in the lifetime u(τk) to give the uncertainty in the
transition rate u(Aki):

For the wall-stabilized arc measurements, the transition rates and their uncertainties were calculated simi-

4 Discussion of results

Our new transition rates for 5p – 5s transitions in Kr I are listed in Table 4. Also listed in Table 4 are our
experimental branching fractions and the lifetimes that were used to calculate the transition rates.

In Table 5 and Fig. 4 we compare our transition rates with several experimental results. The
only other measurement that includes the lines in the IR is that of Chang, Horiguchi and Setser [3] and a
comparison of those results with our data is shown in Fig. 5. The results by Fonseca and Campos [4, 5],
presented in Fig. 4, were recalculated using the same lifetime data as in our work. For the set of strong
lines around 800 nm our transition rates are in good agreement with most of the results obtained by Fonseca
and Campos [4, 5] and diﬀer from those obtained by Ernst et al. [6] by about 10%. The results of Kaschek
et al. [8] diﬀer from ours by a constant scaling factor of 1.3, on average. Only in the case of the line at
810.4 nm, all other experimental data exceed our result by 20%–30%.

The most striking diﬀerence between previous measurements and our results is that our transition
rates for the set of weak lines near 600 nm are much lower than all previous measurements with the exception
of the experiment by Brandt, Helbig and Nick [7]. This strongly suggests that many of the earlier experiments
had problems with self-absorption of the strong lines around 800 nm which would make the weak lines in a
set of transitions from a particular upper level appear stronger.

It is also interesting to compare our results with the theoretical calculations because all calculations
were intermediate-coupling calculations in the Coulomb approximations whereas our semi-empirical lifetimes
were obtained with a modiﬁed intermediate-coupling scheme. Fig. 6 compares our results to the most recent
calculations. The earlier calculations by Murphy [22] are not included because they were superseded by those
of Lilly [21]. For the strongest lines near 800 nm the best agreement, within 10% on average, was found
between our data and calculations made by Aymar and Coulombe [23] with a velocity dipole operator,
while there is a constant disagreement (a factor of 1/3) when they used a length dipole operator. A similar
discrepancy was found with calculations made by Lilly [21]. We note that the discrepancies for the weak
lines near 600 nm and in the IR are considerable but there appear to be no conspicuous systematic trends
as we found in the experimental data.

Figure 1: 5s and 5p energy levels of Kr I. The levels are labeled in JcK–coupling notation which is the most
appropriate for the spectra of the noble gases. The primed and unprimed levels are distinguished by their
diﬀerent core angular momenta Jc. The core level of the unprimed levels is 4p5 2P3/2 whereas it is 4p5 2P1/2
for the primed levels. The two 5s levels with angular momenta of 0 and 2 cannot decay into the ground
state via electric dipole transitions. Several transitions from 5p’ levels to 4p5 4d levels in the infrared near
10000 nm are outside the wavelength range that was accessible in our experiments.

Figure 2: Schematic of the experimental setup for the measurements with the wall-stabilized arc. The
radiation from the arc or the radiometric standard lamp were imaged onto the entrance slit of a 2m–
monochromator by a curved mirror CM. A ﬂat mirror M, that was mounted on a turntable allowed to
alternate between both lightsources. A small fraction of the light was imaged onto the entrance slit of
a 1/4m–monochromator with a beam splitter BS. This monochromator remained set to the Kr I line at
760.2 nm to monitor the stability of the arc discharge. The experimental setup for the measurements with
the NIST 2m – Fourier transform spectrometer was identical but the imaging system was enclosed in a box
that was purged with water vapor- and carbon dioxide- free air.

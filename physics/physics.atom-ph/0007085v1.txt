Measurement of the 21Ne Zeeman frequency shift due to Rb-21Ne collisions

Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA 02138

R.E. Stoner and R.L. Walsworth

(July 24, 2013)

We compared the frequency shift of the 21Ne Zeeman resonance induced by polarized Rb vapor to
the shift induced in the 3He Zeeman resonance. The 3He/Rb shift has recently been measured with
high precision [18], permitting the conversion of our diﬀerential measurement to an absolute value
for the 21Ne/Rb shift. We report a value of κ21 = 31.8 ± 2.8 for the Rb-21Ne enhancement factor at
a temperature of 124.8o ± 1.9oC. We propose high-precision diﬀerential contact shift measurements,
the absolute accuracy of which would be limited by the error in the 3He contact shift.

I. INTRODUCTION

Polarization of noble gases by spin exchange with optically pumped alkali metal vapors [1,2] is an important
technique for a variety of scientiﬁc and technological applications. Polarized noble gases been used for: precise mea-
surements of the neutron spin structure function [3]; neutron polarizers and analyzers [4]; magnetic resonance imaging
[5–7]; studies of gas diﬀusion in porous media [8]; gain media for Zeeman masers [9–11]; and tests of fundamental
symmetries [12–15].

New tests of fundamental symmetries using polarized noble gases have recently been proposed. Kostelecky and
Lane recently reported that a 21Ne/3He diﬀerential magnetometer could be used to test local Lorentz invariance (LLI)
[16]. We have proposed to develop a 21Ne/3He dual noble gas maser to carry out such an LLI test [17].

The spin exchange interaction between alkali and noble gas atoms has been extensively described in the litera-
ture [2,18,20–22]. During spin exchange collisions, there is signiﬁcant overlap of the alkali atom’s valence electron
wavefunction with the noble gas nucleus which comprises a Fermi contact interaction of the form

Hint = α ~K · ~S

(1)

where ~S and ~K are the electron and nuclear spin angular momentum operators, respectively. This interaction leads to
exchange of angular momentum between the alkali valence electron and the noble gas nucleus. The valence electron
and nucleus experience during the collision a strong magnetic ﬁeld from the close proximity of their spin magnetic
moments. In spite of the small fraction of the time spent in collision, the average magnetic ﬁelds experienced by
both the alkali valence electron and the noble gas nucleus can be aﬀected if either the alkali or noble gas species is
polarized. The resultant change in the Larmor precession frequency for either species, referred to as the contact shift,
is expressed in terms of an enhancement factor κ. κ is deﬁned in terms of the total shift in the Larmor precession
frequencies in co-located spherical distributions of magnetizations, induced both by the contact interaction and by
the classical magnetic ﬁelds generated by the magnetizations. κ is the ratio of that total frequency shift (contact
plus classical magnetization) to the shift that would be induced by the classical magnetization alone. κ can be much
greater than unity, increasing with increasing Z of the noble gas nucleus [20]. In the limit where the formation of
alkali-noble gas van der Waals molecules is a negligible part of the spin exchange interaction (true for the experiment
reported in this paper), a single enhancement factor describes both the contact shift of the noble gas Zeeman splitting
by the alkali atoms, and vice versa. [23]. The frequency shift experienced by noble gas atoms in the presence of
polarized alkali atoms, including both the contact shift and the shift due to classical magnetization ﬁelds, is

δωng = (κ − 1 + fDDF ) γng ·

8π

gSµB [a]hSzi

(2)

Recall the elementary result that 8π
3 M is the magnetic ﬁeld strength inside a magnetized sphere with magnetic
dipole moment density M ; the ﬁeld is uniform and parallel to the magnetization. fDDF is a dimensionless factor
that accounts for the eﬀect of classical magnetization ﬁelds (”distant dipole ﬁelds” [18]), and is unity for a spherical
distribution of magnetization. [a] is the number per unit volume of alkali atoms, and γng is the gyromagnetic ratio
of the noble gas species. For convenience, we deﬁne the component of alkali atom magnetization along the magnetic
ﬁeld (z) axis, Ma, as

Ma = ¯hγa [a]hSzi

1

(3)

where γa = gSµB/¯h = 2π·1.40 MHz/gauss is the electron gyromagnetic ratio. The alkali nuclear magnetic moments
do not contribute to the contact shift, but do aﬀect the distant dipole ﬁelds produced by the alkali magnetization
distribution. We ignored these eﬀects on the distant dipole ﬁelds, since they were too small to bear on the results
reported in this work.

In precision measurements, it is important to be able to monitor the absolute polarization of the noble gases.
Romalis and Cates [18] demonstrated accurate polarimetry of 3He using the Rb Zeeman frequency shift due to Rb-
3He spin exchange collisions, and made a very precise measurement of the Rb-3He enhancement factor. Future use
of 21Ne in precision measurement applications would beneﬁt from the use of contact shift polarimetry, but there is
at present no published measurement of the Rb-21Ne enhancement factor. In this paper we present the ﬁrst such
measurement. We measured the net Larmor frequency shifts, simultaneously impressed by the presence of polarized
Rb, on ensembles of polarized 3He and 21Ne precessing in the same [nearly] spherical glass cell. The measurement
presented in this paper is not the ﬁrst in which a ratio of contact shift enhancement factors was determined. Baranga
et. al. measured the shifts of the Larmor precession frequencies of Rb and K vapors residing in the same cell, induced
simultaneously by the presence of polarized 3He [19].

The experiment is described in Section II. Determining the ratio of the Rb-induced shifts permitted us to divide
out the dependence on Rb magnetization, and express the 21Ne enhancement factor κ21 in terms of the 3He enhance-
ment factor κ3. The very accurate measurement of κ3 by Romalis and Cates determined the absolute contact shift
enhancement factor κ21. Analysis of the data is presented in Section III. Suggestions for improved measurements are
given in Section IV.

II. APPARATUS, PROCEDURE, SYSTEM PARAMETERS

We employed a 21Ne/3He dual noble gas Zeeman maser to establish simultaneous precession of the 21Ne and the 3He
in the same sealed glass cell. The 21Ne/3He maser is a new device that will be described elsewhere; that description
is summarized here. Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the maser. Circularly polarized light resonant with the
Rb D1 transition (795 nm) is generated by a 30 W laser diode array (LDA); the light is directed onto a 1.4 cm dia
[near-] spherical sealed glass cell containing 228 torr of 21Ne, 266 torr of 3He, 31 torr of N2, and Rb metal of natural
isotopic composition [24]. The LDA light propagates along the axis of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of strength 3 Gauss.
The ﬁeld is generated by a precision solenoid/µ-metal-shield system capable of producing a 3 G magnetic ﬁeld with
≤ 35 µG/cm magnetic ﬁeld gradients, with no gradient shimming. The main solenoid was driven using a current
source capable of ∼ 3 ppm stability over timescales of order 1000 sec. The glass cell was heated both by the LDA
light and blown hot air to a temperature of (124.8 ± 1.9)oC (see Sec. III). The temperature of the air surrounding
the cell was controlled to about 43 mK RMS. The total output power of the LDA was actively controlled to about a
part in 104.

The Rb was polarized by optical pumping; the resulting Rb electron polarization was very close to unity. The output
power of the LDA was about 30W, so that even though it had a very broad (∼ 1.5 nm) linewidth, the on-resonant
optical power was roughly 0.5 W. Thus, the optical pumping rate was > 105 photon absorptions per sec per Rb atom.
The rate of Rb polarization destruction events per Rb atom in the cell was < 103 sec−1 so that the Rb electron
polarization was greater than 0.99. Pickup coils wound in series were placed in close proximity to the cell. The coils
were excited by the magnetic ﬂux associated with the precession of the polarized noble gases. The coils were part of a
tuned resonant circuit with resonances at both noble gas precession frequencies. The large current ﬂow induced in the
pickup coils by resonant excitation resulted in magnetic ﬁelds oscillating at the noble gas nuclear Larmor frequencies
being impressed back on the precessing atoms. This feedback resulted in steady state maser operation.

21Ne has nuclear spin 3/2, and thus a quadrupole moment. The quadrupole moments of the 21Ne ensemble interact
coherently with electric ﬁeld gradients at the glass cell walls, shifting the four Zeeman energy levels so as to split
the three [otherwise degenerate] dipole transitions [25]. The splitting is proportional to δωQ ∝ 3 cos2 θ − 1, where
θ is the angle of the cell’s symmetry axis with the magnetic ﬁeld. We oriented the cell as close as possible to the
”magic angle” cos θ = p1/3 to minimize the quadrupole splitting. The quadrupole wall shifts in the cell were not
measured; however, computer simulations indicate that without proper cell orientation, realistic-sized splittings could
disrupt 21Ne maser oscillation. In any case, 21Ne maser oscillation with steady-state amplitude was attained. We
observed a small (∼ 10 µHz) sinusoidal modulation of the 21Ne maser frequency. The period of the modulation was
about 16 hr. We speculate that the modulation was a consequence of remnant quadrupole splitting resulting from
cell orientation error. In any case, the eﬀect was small, with a period much longer than the duration of our contact
shift measurements, and thus was not a source of signiﬁcant systematic error.

The 3He and 21Ne maser signals were presented to a low-noise preamplier. The preamp output was then analyzed
using lockin ampliﬁers, which were referenced to a set of synchronized signal generators tuned near the noble gas

2

maser frequencies and locked to an H-maser-derived 5 MHz signal. The phases of both noble gas masers’ precession
were recorded digitally at a sample rate of 1 Hz. The A/D sampling trigger was also derived from the master 5 MHz
reference.

The measurements consisted of observing the maser phases during a series of reversals of the direction of the Rb
polarization. The Rb polarization was reversed by rotation of the quarter-wave plates (Fig. 1) and was typically
achieved in ≤ 20 sec. The total duration of a set of reversals was about 1000 sec., limited by magnetic ﬁeld stability
as well as the extent to which the noble gas masers’ steady states were disrupted by the alternating Rb polarization.
Two sets of reversal data were acquired. Clear changes in the slopes of the phase curves were precisely correlated with
reversal of the Rb polarization direction; these frequency changes were the result of the contact shift combined with
the [classical] shift due to the Rb magnetization distribution. The change of noble gas maser oscillation frequency
induced by Rb polarization reversal was about 44 mHz for 21Ne maser and 71 mHz for the 3He maser.

III. DATA AND ANALYSIS

Phase data for the second of the two measurement scans are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. We model the 21Ne phase ϕ21
(see Fig. 2) and the 3He phase ϕ3 (see Fig. 3) acquired by the lockin ampliﬁers as evolving according to the following
equations:

ϕ21 = ϕ21,o + γ21Bot − 2πυref,21 + γ21Z t

where: γ21 (γ3) is the gyromagnetic ratio of Ne (He); κ21 (κ3) is the enhancement factor for Ne (He); fDDF is the
dimensionless factor to account for the classical magnetic ﬁeld due to the Rb magnetization; νref,21 and νref,3 are the
reference frequencies presented to the lockin ampliﬁers; Bo is the time-average magnetic ﬁeld strength over the time
interval; δB is the time-dependent deviation of the magnetic ﬁeld from its mean value; and MRb is the Rb magneti-
zation. Note that independent maser frequency measurements determined the ratio of the two gyromagnetic ratios,
γ3/γ21, to an accuracy much better than 1 ppm. Also, the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds due to noble gas magnetization
ﬁelds on the phases have been neglected in comparison to the contact shift eﬀects; this is reasonable for the noble gas
magnetizations of this experiment (see below).

Magnetic ﬁeld drift occurred over the course of the measurement scan. However, the 21Ne and 3He masers are
co-located magnetometers, so that we can construct a data set from which the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld drift and Rb
distant dipole ﬁelds have been removed. We deﬁne

Aside from a trivial phase oﬀset and known linear phase evolution, ∆ϕ reﬂects the action of the Rb contact shifts only:
phase evolution due to magnetic ﬁelds is subtracted oﬀ. This combined phase proﬁle is plotted in Fig. 4. As seen in
Fig. 4, the phase evolution due to the contact shift was a piecewise-linear ”sawtooth” proﬁle. Since our measurement
is derived from computing the diﬀerences in slopes between adjacent linear regions of the curve, removal of constant
and linear dependence from the phase data had no eﬀect on the measurement. Thus, our plots of the phase data
shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 are displayed with mean value and mean slope of zero.

If the Rb magnetization were known, one could immediately deduce κ21 using eqn (6). Even though the Rb electron
spin polarization was very close to unity, the density was not known a priori. It was therefore necessary to consider
the ratio of contact shifts impressed on the ϕ21 and the ∆ϕ phase curves, and then determine the temperature
self-consistently.

The data were analyzed in two ways which yielded essentially identical results. First, we computed the average
changes in slope of the phase curves ϕ21 and ∆ϕ, caused by the reversals of the Rb magnetization. That is, a least-
squares linear ﬁtting routine was used to extract the slope of each piecewise linear region of the phase curves. The
diﬀerences in slope of adjacent regions was then recorded for each of the phase curves. The mean absolute values

3

of the slope diﬀerences were then computed for each data set. We deﬁne M21 as the mean of the absolute value of
the slope diﬀerences for ϕ21, and ∆M as that for the ∆ϕ proﬁle. The uncertainties were estimated as the standard
deviation of the mean in the slope diﬀerences’ absolute values.

We deﬁne the ratio of mean slope changes as R ≡ M21/∆M . The weighted average value for R from the two
data sets was R = 0.1262 ± 0.0025 where a one-sigma uncertainty is reported. The uncertainty was almost entirely
due to that in M21. The fractional uncertainty in ∆M for both of the data sets was < 0.1% This indicates that Rb
polarization reversal was achieved to high precision and that the Rb magnetization was stable to better than 0.1%
over the course of the measurements. The fractional uncertainty in M21 was much larger, ∼ 2%, caused by the eﬀects
of magnetic ﬁeld drift. In principle, we could have analyzed the ϕ3 proﬁle rather than ϕ21, but magnetic ﬁeld drift
eﬀects were γ3/γ21 = 9.65 times larger on ϕ3 than ϕ21, making it impractical to extract slope data from ϕ3 directly
(see Fig. 3).

In our analysis we did not account for possible variations in frequency due to changes in the noble gas longitudinal
polarization that occurred in the course of a measurement. The magnetization of the noble gases created magnetic
ﬁelds which varied in time during the course of the each of the two measurement scans, as evidenced by [small]
maser amplitude changes observed during the scans. A given maser’s magnetization ﬁeld could not aﬀect its own
frequency, since magnetization ﬁelds were parallel to the magnetization in the near-spherical cell. However, each
maser’s frequency was shifted by the other’s magnetization, and such shifts did not subtract out of ∆ϕ as did
magnetic ﬁeld drift. The noble gas polarizations underwent both slow drift as well as variations correlated with
the Rb polarization reversals. The small uncertainty in the ∆ϕ slope diﬀerences proves that frequency variations
due to slow drift in the noble gas magnetizations had negligible eﬀect. We also determined that the variations of
the noble gas polarization caused by the periodic Rb polarization reversal had negligible eﬀect on the contact shift
measurement. Periodic reversal of the Rb polarization (i.e., ”square wave” modulation of the Rb polarization) induced
a ”sawtooth wave” modulation (i.e., integrated square wave) on the noble gas polarizations of peak-to-peak amplitude
approximately γSEτ , where γSE is the Rb-noble gas spin exchange rate per noble gas atom, and τ = time between
Rb polarization reversals. Thus, the varying noble gas polarizations induced large changes in the maser frequencies
over a measurement period: we estimate that a 2.8 mHz shift was induced on the 3He maser by the 21Ne polarization
variation and a 0.7 mHz shift was induced on the 21Ne maser by the 3He polarization variation. However, given a
constant time interval τ between Rb polarization reversals, the average frequency shifts due to the Rb-driven noble
gas polarization variations did not change from one period to the next, thus they subtracted out in the calculation
of the period-to-period frequency changes M21 and ∆M . We conclude that noble gas polarization-induced magnetic
ﬁelds had no systematic eﬀect on the measurement of R.

It is easy to show from eqns (4) and (6) that the ratio R can be interpreted as

κ21 + (fDDF − 1)

κ3 − κ21

R = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where it is seen that dependence on the Rb magnetization divided out. The value and estimated uncertainty for R
can then be used to compute the value and uncertainty of the desired contact shift enhancement factor for 21Ne,
κ21, though the system temperature must be known because 3He contact shift κ3 is temperature-dependent. κ21 and
the system temperature must be determined self-consistently, and the eﬀect of classical magnetization ﬁelds must be
accounted for: these questions are addressed below.

We now consider the second method of analyzing the data to obtain a value for R, which yielded essentially the
same results as the above approach. While this second method is slightly more complex, it is useful because it
provides a framework for estimating the size of magnetic ﬁeld drift in the present measurement. This second method
of extracting a value of R from the data considers the phase data sets to be N -component vectors (denoted by a
tilde), where N ≡ number of data in the set (∼ 103 for each of the two scans). We use the ∆ϕ proﬁle as a model
of the shape of the Rb magnetization-induced phase (see eqn 6). We then seek to describe the ˜ϕ21 proﬁle vector
as a linear combination of elements of a partial basis of orthonormal vectors. The partial basis included an element
corresponding to the [normalized] ∆ϕ proﬁle (≡ ˜Vo). Additional basis vectors orthogonal to it, n ˜Vioi=1,Nb−1
were
derived from ∆ϕ and Legendre polynomials {Pi}i=0,Nb−1 using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization [27]. The number
of basis vectors Nb was of order 101, whereas the dimension of the vector space N was of order 103, so Nb << N , and
we ﬁnd:

The coeﬃcient of ˜V0 in this linear combination, a0, was proportional to the value for R obtained from that data set.
The coeﬃcients of the linear combination were determined using linear least squares ﬁtting and by simple projection

˜ϕ21 =

of ˜ϕ21 onto the vectors of the partial basis, with identical results. The number of elements in the basis set was varied,
but the coeﬃcients obtained from the least squares ﬁt remained the same regardless of the size of the basis set.

Using this second data analysis method, we thus determined two values of R, one from each data set.

It was
not possible to estimate uncertainties for the individual values of R from the vector analysis method. Uncertainty
estimates from the least squares analyses were unrealistically small because the vector analysis could not account
for the eﬀect of a non-zero projection of the magnetic ﬁeld drifts along the Rb magnetization-induced phase proﬁle
vectors. We take the value of R to be the mean of the results for the two data sets, and we coarsely estimate the
uncertainty of R as the deviation of the two values, to obtain R = 0.1287 ± 0.0036. This result agrees well with that
of the ﬁrst method of data analysis. For computing κ21 we will use the result from the ﬁrst method of analysis since
the error estimate is probably more reliable.

We can compute the magnetic ﬁeld drift proﬁle by subtracting from ˜ϕ21 its projection on the Rb magnetization

basis proﬁle ˜V0:

˜δB =

1
γ21

d

dt (cid:16) ˜ϕ21 −(cid:16) ˜ϕ21 · ˜Vo(cid:17) ˜Vo(cid:17)

(9)

Note that the proﬁle ˜δB is the magnetic ﬁeld drift orthogonal to ˜V0. The drift proﬁle from the second data set is
plotted in Fig. 5; the time derivative of the [discretely sampled] proﬁle was estimated by ﬁnite diﬀerence. Note that
the ﬁeld was stable to about ±3 ppm RMS.
Having obtained a value for R, we can then solve eqn (7) for κ21 in terms of measured parameters, since κ3 is known
[18]. However, κ21 is expected to be temperature-dependent [18,20] and so the temperature at which the experiment
was carried out must be reported along with the value of κ21. The Rb and noble gas temperature indicated by the
hot air temperature control system was in error, because: the absolute calibration was poorly known; and the cell
was heated by the LDA to a temperature higher than that indicated by the control system. Thus, it was necessary
to deduce the noble gas/Rb vapor temperature from the contact shift data, and the known 3He enhancement factor
(with its known temperature dependence), in a self-consistent way. This was achieved by ﬁrst noting that the mean
slope change ∆M is related to the enhancement factors and the Rb magnetization via

∆M = 2γ3

8π
3 |(κ3 − κ21) MRb (T )|

(10)

where |MRb (T )| (see eqn (3) above) is a known function of temperature. The Rb number density [Rb] is related to
temperature by [26]

[Rb] =

109.318−

4040

T

(1.38 · 10−17) · T

(T in oK)

The measured temperature dependence of the 3He enhancement factor is [18]

κ3 = 4.52 + 0.00934 [T (oC)]

(11)

(12)

Substituting (11) and (3) into (10) yields an equation relating κ21 and temperature (and known/measured parameters).
Substituting (12) into (7) yields another equation relating κ21 and temperature. This system of two [nonlinear]
equations and two unknowns can be solved to yield the temperature and κ21. The temperature determination
depends strongly on the enhancement factor, while the enhancement factor determination depends only weakly on the
temperature (via the known temperature dependence of κ3). Thus, an iterative method to compute the temperature
rapidly converges: an initial guess for the temperature enables calculation of κ21, which in turn permits calculation of
the Rb magnetization and thus the system temperature. This corrected temperature is used to re-compute a better
estimate for κ21, which is used to re-compute a better estimate of the Rb magnetization, etc.

Using the result R = 0.1262± 0.0025 from the slope diﬀerence analysis, we determine the contact shift enhancement
factor for Rb and 21Ne to be κ21 = 31.8 ± 2.8 at a temperature of (124.8 ± 1.9)oC. Note that the noble gas/Rb vapor
temperature is much higher than the value of 112oC indicated by the hot air temperature control system, presumably
the result of heating by the laser diode array. We are not aware of a previous measurement of the Rb-21Ne contact shift.
Walker estimated the Rb-21Ne enhancement factor to be 38, and the ratio of the Rb-21Ne and Rb-3He enhancement
factors to be 4.3 [20]. We report this ratio to be 5.6 ± 0.5.
The 3% uncertainty in R dominates other sources of error, inducing a 9% uncertainty in κ21. The contribution to
the uncertainty in κ21 resulting from the 1.5% uncertainty in the He enhancement factor κ3 is only 1.5%, which is
negligible. The uncertainty in temperature induced a 0.3% uncertainty in κ21. To the extent that the cell could be
described as an ellipsoid of revolution, its deviation from sphericality induced an uncertainty of 0.15% in κ21 with
zero systematic correction.

5

The claim of zero systematic correction of the classical magnetization ﬁeld shift for a ellipsoidal cell is justiﬁed
by noting that:
i) the classical magnetization ﬁeld inside an ellipsoid of uniform magnetization is uniform, with
its magnitude depending on the ellipsoid’s shape and the relative orientation of the ellipsoid major axis and the

magnetization vector; and ii) when the ellipsoid major axis is oriented at the magic angle θm = cos−1(cid:0)1(cid:14)√3(cid:1) with

respect to the magnetization direction, the component of the classical magnetization ﬁeld parallel to the magnetization
is exactly that of a spherical distribution with the same magnetization, regardless of the ellipsoid’s shape. We oriented
the cell at θm in order to suppress quadrupole wall shifts, with an uncertainty of about 10o. The 10o uncertainty in
orientation leads to the estimated uncertainty of 0.15% in κ21 due to measured asphericality of the cell.

IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVED MEASUREMENTS; CONCLUSIONS

There are straightforward improvements that could be implemented to reduce the uncertainty in the present mea-
surement. The experiment was conducted in the course of developing a 21Ne/3He dual Zeeman maser, so that
opportunity for taking contact shift data was very limited. A factor of three improvement in the result could easily
be achieved just by taking ten times more data. Active ﬁeld stabilization using an independent magnetometer [18]
would essentially eliminate ﬁeld drift, reducing statistical uncertainty in the measurement to that due to phase noise,
a factor of > 0.03/0.001 = 30 reduction. Active ﬁeld stabilization would also permit a reduction in the phase noise
since the signal acquisition bandwidth could be reduced by at least a factor of 3, so that the statistical uncertainty
could be reduced by about a factor of 300 compared to the present experiment. This uncertainty would already be
less than the uncertainty contributed by cell asphericality (0.15%). However, the absolute uncertainty in the Rb-21Ne
contact shift enhancement factor κ21 would then be limited by the uncertainty in that for He, κ3, 1.5%, whereas the
ratio κ21/κ3 would be known to an uncertainty of only a few tenths of one percent.

It should be possible to measure ratios of alkali-noble gas enhancement factors to a level well below a part in
103 if one could completely eliminate eﬀects of the classical magnetization ﬁeld shift. We have already shown that
one can use diﬀerential magnetometry to obtain data from which classical magnetization ﬁeld shifts are eliminated
to high precision. It can be shown that using a three-species noble gas maser, one could measure the contact shift
enhancement factor of a third species if the other species’ enhancement factors are known, independent of the classical
magnetization ﬁeld shift. Even though it has not yet been done, we believe it is a straightforward matter to implement
a three-species maser in a single-bulb glass cell.

A comprehensive set of contact shift data would serve as a probe of noble gas-alkali interaction potentials [20].
A program using multi-species noble gas masers to measure contact shift ratios could be implemented using 129Xe,
83Kr, 21Ne, and 3He along with K, Cs, and Rb in turn. Na would be a poor candidate for use in a noble gas maser
because of its relatively low vapor pressure. The remaining stable noble gas isotope, 131Xe, cannot be used with the
other noble gases in a multi-species maser because its nuclear dipole moment has a sign opposite to that of the others
(making it impossible to achieve a population inversion simultaneously with the other species). However, it may be
possible to measure the 131Xe precession frequency in free induction decay in the presence of two other noble gas
masers. There are no other stable noble gas isotopes having non-zero nuclear spin.

Contact shift ratios would be converted to absolute values for enhancement factors by using the measured values

for 3He/Rb [18] and 3He/K [19]. The enhancement factor for 3He/Cs has not yet been measured.

Measuring contact shift ratios to a few parts in 104 could proceed as follows: one would ﬁrst measure the ratio
of the enhancement factors of 83Kr and 129Xe to each other. The contact shift enhancement factors for 83Kr and
129Xe are estimated by Walker to be about 230 and 730, respectively [20]. Using an independent magnetometer with
the colocated Xe-Kr masers, the ratio of the [large] enhancement factors of Xe and Kr could be measured to a few
parts in 104 even if the classical magnetization ﬁeld were accounted for only to the 10% level (which can be done
trivially- a ∼ 1% accounting is claimed in this work). Triple masers using Kr and Xe, along with 21Ne and 3He in
turn would yield high-precision measurements of the ratios of all the enhancement factors; the known enhancement
factor for He would then determine the absolute values of the other enhancement factors. Temperature dependences
could of course also be measured. In particular, enhancement factor ratios as a function of density (normalized to
some experimental reference density) could be determined to very high precision. Improved cell thermometry would
eliminate the need to depend on a temperature-density calibration [26] to determine the cell temperature. Also, for
very high precision measurements, control of the noble gas magnetization ﬁelds would have to be maintained more
carefully than in the present work; in particular, the time between polarization reversals could be decreased in order
to increase the relative size of the contact shifts in comparison to noble gas polarization induced frequency shifts. It
might also be important to account carefully for the contribution of van der Waals molecule formation to the contact
frequency shifts.

Finally, we remark that a two species maser using 3He and 21Ne has been proposed for a high precision test of

6

local Lorentz invariance (LLI) [17], in which Rb-noble gas contact shifts would be an important systematic eﬀect.
Adding a co-located 129Xe maser would provide a high precision in situ measurement of the Rb magnetization. With
part-in-104 knowledge of the enhancement factors, the systematic eﬀects of contact shifts on a search for LLI violation
could be rendered negligible with the use of the 129Xe maser ”co-polarimeter”.

We thank T. Chupp for the use of the 21Ne/3He cell, and gratefully acknowledge D. Phillips and D. Bear for useful

conversations.

FIG. 1. The 21Ne/3He dual Zeeman maser. The device operates similarly to the 129Xe/3He maser [10], except that the
21Ne/3He maser employs a single- rather than a double-bulb cell. Co-located ensembles of noble gas atoms are polarized by
spin exchange collisions with optically pumped Rb atoms. Precession of polarized atoms excites current in nearby inductive
pickup coils, which are part of a circuit tuned with resonances near the Larmor precession frequencies of the two noble gas
species. The current induces magnetic ﬁelds which act back on the precessing atoms, providing feedback for maser oscillation.

FIG. 4. The combined phase ∆ϕ of the two masers as per eqn (5). This proﬁle is proportional to the phase variation induced
by the Rb-noble gas contact shift alone. The sawtooth shape arises from periodic reversal of the Rb polarization, which reverses
the Rb-noble gas contact frequency shift. The highly regular shape of the diﬀerence curve reﬂects the fact that magnetic ﬁeld
drift eﬀects are subtracted out.

FIG. 5. Magnetic ﬁeld drift during the measurements of Figs. 2 and 3, computed from eqn (9). The ﬁeld strength was 3 G,
so that the fractional RMS stability of the magnetic ﬁeld was about 3 ppm. Field drift was the dominant source of experimental
error.

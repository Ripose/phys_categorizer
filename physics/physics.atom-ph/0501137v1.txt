Abstract

We show that the superﬂuid state (SF) of fermionic atoms exist only for

the magnetic ﬁelds lesser than the critical magnetic ﬁeld. This critical mag-

netic ﬁeld is determined by the equality of the Zeeman energy splitting for

atoms with diﬀerent spin projections to the energy gap of fermionic atoms

without a magnetic ﬁeld. For magnetic ﬁelds usually using in Feshbach reso-

nance experiments a SF state is lost because these ﬁelds are much more than

the critical ﬁeld. We show that the transition temperature Tc of the SF state

decreases as the magnetic ﬁeld increases.

The trapping and cooling of gases with Fermi statistics has become one of the central

areas of research within the ﬁeld of ultracold atomic gases. Much progress has been made

in the achievement of degenerate regimes of trapped atomic Fermi gases [ 1 - 5]. The major

goals of studies of these systems is to observe a transition to a paired - fermion superﬂuid

state. There has been considerable interest in achieving superﬂuidity in an ultracold trapped

Fermi gas in which a Feshbach resonance is used to tune the interatomic attraction by

variation of a magnetic ﬁeld. The interactions which drive the pairing in these gases can be

controlled using a Feshbach resonance, in which a molecular level is Zeeman tuned through

zero binding energy using an external magnetic ﬁeld. Via a Feshbach resonance it is possible

to tune the strength and the sign of the eﬀective interaction between particles. In result,

magnetic - ﬁeld Feshbach resonances provide the means for controlling the strength of cold

atom interactions, characterized s - wave scattering length a, as well as whether they are

eﬀectively repulsive ( a > 0) or attractive ( a < 0 ). Therefore, the tunability of interactions

in fermionic atoms provides a unique possibility to explore the Bose - Einstein condensate

to Bardeen - Cooper -Schriever ( BEC - BCS ) crossover [ 6 - 8 ], an intriguing interplay

between the superﬂuidity of bosons and Cooper pairing of fermions. A Feshbach resonance

oﬀers the unique possibility to study the crossover between situations governed by Bose -

Einstein and Fermi - Dirac statistics. When the scattering length a is positive the atoms pair

in a bound molecular state and these bosonic dimers can form a Bose - Einstein condensate;

when a is negative, one expects the well - known BCS model for superconductivity to be

valid.

In this paper, we show that the superﬂuid ( SF ) state of degenerate fermionic gases

analogous to superconductivity exist only for magnetic ﬁelds B < Bcr. We show that this

critical magnetic ﬁeld which destroys the SF state is determined by the equality of the

Zeeman energy splitting ∆Zee = 2µmagB for atoms with diﬀerent spin ( spin - up and spin -

down ) projections to the energy gap ∆0 of fermionic atoms for T = 0 without a magnetic

ﬁeld. For values of the magnetic ﬁeld usually using in Feshbach resonance experiments

for cold fermionic atoms a SF state is lost because these ﬁelds are much more than the

2

critical ﬁeld. For example, for 6Li atoms [ 9 ] the Zeeman energy splitting is about [

10 ] 76MHz where as ∆0 < 20kHz(1µK). Note that in conventional superconductors a

superconductivity is lost for ferromagnetic phase [ 11] if the Zeeman energy splitting which

is determined by the magnetization exceeds √2∆0.

We consider an uniform gas of Fermi atoms with two hyperﬁne ( spin - up

The quasiparticle occupation numbers satisfy Fermi - Dirac statistics. They are deﬁned by

the Fermi distribution formula and the energy of the elementary excitations are determined

also [11] by the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the usual BCS gap equation ( Eq.(4)) using cutting oﬀ [12] the logarithmic integral at

of the elementary excitations must be positive, therefore, if ∆ < µmagB there is a nonzero

This spectrum was obtained in Ref.[11] for the ferromagnetic phase of the conventional

superconductors. The equation (8a) has a threshold at the value 2µmagBth = ∆0(g) for

which this equation ﬁrst has solutions for B

Bth, and, accordingly, the energy gap ∆(g, B)

(cid:23)

has a solution only for B

Bth. At the threshold the Zeeman splitting ∆th

Zee = 2µmagBth is

(cid:23)

equal to the energy gap ∆0(g), i. e. ∆Zee = ∆0. For B < Bth the minimal value of ηp in

the BCS gap equation equal to zero, i.e. ηp(min) = 0, therefore, for these magnetic ﬁelds we

have the standard gap parameter ∆0(g). Beyond the threshold B > Bth there is ηp(min) 6
and, therefore, the gap parameter is ∆(g, B). At the threshold itself ∆(g, Bth) = 0 and

= 0

ηp(min)(Bth) = ∆0
2µmag

.

The BCS superﬂuid state of a two component Fermi gas is encoded in a single BCS gap

∆. As a result, the energy gap for magnetic ﬁelds ∆Zee < ∆th

Zee is ∆0(g), and for magnetic

ﬁelds above the threshold ∆Zee (cid:23)

∆th

Zee the energy gap is ∆(g, B).

We consider the thermodynamic properties of Fermi atoms with two hyperﬁne states

for magnetic ﬁelds above the threshold. In calculations it is convenient to start from the

thermodynamic potential Ω, and the diﬀerence between the thermodynamic potential Ωs in

the superﬂuid state and the value in the normal state Ωn at the same temperature [12] is

Changing in Eq.(9) from integration over dg1 to that over d∆, and using Eq.(8b) we obtain

the diﬀerence between the ground - state energies of the superﬂuid Es and normal En states

that is why a SF state can not exist for these magnetic ﬁelds because of B

∆0.

For B < Bcr there is a superﬂuid BCS state. The critical temperature Tc is determined

by standard manner [12], and in the BCS gap equation ( Eq.(4)) the quasiparticle occupation

numbers are given by the Fermi distribution formula ( Eqs.(6)). Following [12], we obtain

the temperature dependence of the energy gap ∆ near the transition point T

In summary, we show that the superﬂuid state of fermionic atoms is destroying by the

magnetic ﬁeld. Due to the Zeeman energy splitting for atoms with diﬀerent spin projec-

tions the superﬂuid state exist only for the magnetic ﬁelds lesser than the critical magnetic

ﬁeld. As the magnetic ﬁeld increases the transition temperature Tc of the superﬂuid state

decreases. The critical magnetic ﬁeld is determined by the equality of the Zeeman energy

splitting to the energy gap without a magnetic ﬁeld. For the magnetic ﬁeld greater than

the critical ﬁeld the energy gap depends on the magnetic ﬁeld, however, for these magnetic

ﬁelds the normal state has the lesser energy than the superﬂuid state. For values of magnetic

ﬁelds usually using in Feshbach resonance experiments a SF state is lost because these ﬁelds

are much more than the critical ﬁeld.

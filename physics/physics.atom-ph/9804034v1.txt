Raman cooling of non-zero spin atoms in the presence of gravitational and external magnetic
ﬁelds is investigated. The magnetic ﬁeld is to be adjusted to compensate the gravitational force
for ground-state atoms. The dark state (DS) is created and supported in momentum space with
additional velocity-selective two-photon transitions. The minimum allowed temperature is found
to be determined only by the width of velocity selection and therefore can be much less than the
gravitational limit. Complete set of analytical formulas describing cooling of dilute atomic sample
is derived. On this basis numerical simulations in one-dimension (1D) case are carried out.

I. INTRODUCTION

Methods of laser cooling of atoms achieved a great progress in present time. There are three typical temperature
scales characterized this methods. The ﬁrst one is peculiar to the most common scheme where the Doppler shift
causes the radiation pressure force to be velocity dependent, thus damping atomic motion when the laser frequency is
tuned below an atomic resonance. The minimum temperature for atoms cooled in such a way is called the ”Doppler
limit”. It constitutes [1] kBTD = ¯hγ/2, where γ is the natural width of the laser driven transition, and for D line of
Na is about 240 µK.

Schemes based on dissipation of atomic energy via interaction with the vacuum modes of electromagnetic ﬁeld have
a lower border for the temperature deﬁned by the minimum of recoil energy which atom obtains after spontaneous
photon emission. Corresponding scale is known as the recoil limit kBTR = (¯hk)2/2M , where k is the wave number of
the light and M is the atomic mass. For Na it approximately equals to 1 µK.

To overcome this limit two subrecoil cooling methods have been developed and demonstrated: velocity selective
coherent population trapping (VSCPT) [2] and Raman cooling [3]. Both methods imply the existence of so-called
dark state, which does not interact with the light, has a long lifetime and occupies only a few modes in the momentum
space [4]. During the cooling cycle atoms diﬀuse into this state due to random recoil induced by spontaneous emission
and accumulate. Since DS has a vanishing absorption rate of light, the ﬁnal temperature is restricted no by the recoil
limit but by the time of cooling which, however, cannot be greater than the lifetime of DS.

If there were no Earth gravity one would use an inﬁnitely long cooling times. In practice the gravitational ﬁeld
pushes atoms from DS that reduces its lifetime dramatically. For any 3D conﬁguration this leads to the third scale of
temperature [5] kBTG = M g/k, the gravitational limit. It lies below the recoil limit for most atoms, e.g., TG = 0.07TR
for Rb, and TG = 0.003TR for Na.

Two ways are foreseen to prepare a stable quantum state of matter in the gravitational ﬁeld: to bound particles or to
hung them free in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld using Stern-Gerlach eﬀect. In the ﬁrst approach the atom is conﬁned
by a conservative trapping potential which can be realized, e.g., in a far-oﬀ-resonance or dipole trap, where an intensity
gradient provides a spatially dependent ac Stark shift. In momentum space, only the existence of approximate dark
state, i.e., the state having decay rate in special 1D atomic and laser ﬁeld conﬁguration much smaller than for all
other states in a trap, was demonstrated up to now [6]. Finite lifetime of approximate DS evidently restricts the
cooling possibilities in a trap, leaving the question about going below the gravitational limit to be clariﬁed. However,
a scheme [7] which is based on the creation of a dark state in position space with the help of an appropriate spatial
proﬁle of the cooling laser, e.g., in a doughnut mode, seems to be much more eﬃcient, allowing to cool a signiﬁcant
fraction of atoms to the ground state of a trapping potential.

Another approach may be applied to atoms possessing a magnetic moment. Superimposing a weakly inhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld on the path of beforehand polarized particles and adjusting the ﬁeld gradient it is possible to compensate
the gravity for deﬁnite internal atomic state. However, the magnetic ﬁeld induces spatially dependent shifts of the
Zeeman levels, which lead to unwanted residual excitation from the DS in the framework of any traditional subrecoil

cooling method. Moreover, in the case of VSCPT the dark state can not be an eigenvector of the total Hamiltonian
since only one of the internal states forming the non-coupled to laser ﬁeld superposition may escape the gravity. Thus,
both VSCPT and Raman cooling mechanisms in their standard form are incompatible with the last approach.

To resolve this problem we suggest a modiﬁcation of Raman cooling method, where the ground-level atoms are
made motionally free with the Stern-Gerlach eﬀect and the DS is created and supported in momentum space of this
atoms with additional velocity-selective two-photon transitions. The transitions couple external momentum states of
the same ground internal level and are organized in such a manner that DS cyclically occupies diﬀerent thin sets of
velocity modes leaving unreachable for the Raman excitation-repumping pulse sequences all the time.

In Sec. II detailed qualitative treatment of suggested scheme is given. At certain physical condition all the scheme
stages allow an analytical description that is done in Sec. III - Sec. V. Namely, in Sec. III formulas describing coherent
two-photon transition are presented when atom is placed in superposition of two plain electromagnetic waves with
arbitrary directions of the wave vectors. In Sec. IV Raman excitation to the closest hyperﬁne level is investigated in
neglecting of the photon spontaneous emission. Both exact quadrature and convenient approximate expressions are
derived. In Sec. V the optical pumping of atoms back to the ground state is considered for short times of light pulse,
i.e., when the external potential ﬁeld does not aﬀect the atomic motion substantially. A numerical simulation of 100
cooling sequences in one dimension is given in Sec. VI. Section VII concludes a summary of the obtained results.

prove this imagine an atom with momentum p passing through a superposition of two laser beams. The superposition
k2 (standing wave) [9,10] or as an eﬀective atomic hologram,
may be treated as a diﬀraction grating in the case k1 ↑↓
when directions of the wave vectors are arbitrary [11]. At low laser light intensity and large detuning ∆1 only the
ﬁrst-order Bragg scattering is of importance [12]. In this case, two diﬀraction modes with indices 0 and 1 resonantly
couple with each other [10,13]. Physically, the ﬁrst-order Bragg resonance corresponds to an absorption and stimulated
photon emission process from one laser beam to another. As a consequence of the atomic kinetic energy conservation
one gets the Bragg resonance condition

In a second step of cooling, the Raman excitation cycle [3] takes place. In agreement with Eq. (2.5), atoms with
state by varying the diﬀerence of beam frequencies. Due to ﬁnite width
any negative p can be transferred to the
of trapping zone atoms with positive p < M δv also have a chance of transition. The DS being hidden near the point
p = ∆p > M δv does not take part in this process, what is illustrated in Fig. 1(b).

In a third step, an optical pumping pulse at frequency ω2 is used to return the atoms back to the state

. It

is important that the ground level appears to be far oﬀ resonance and laser light does not aﬀect DS directly. The
population of DS rises during the spontaneous emission process, which randomizes the atomic momenta [see Fig. 1(c)].
To increase the eﬃciency of DS growing one can combine the Raman and optical pumping pulses as it is done,
for example, in the classical method [3], where every Raman transition is followed by the optical repumping, or may
apply a series of cycles each including multiple Raman and one optical pumping pulses.

Then the sequence of steps 1 – 3 are repeated with opposite directions of k1 and k2 involving residual positive-
momentum atoms of the ground level in DS ﬁlling and ﬁnishing a 1D cooling cycle along ∆p. After such a stage the
DS occupies its initial place near the point

∆p.

By choosing linearly independent vectors ∆m

p in a set of two (m = 1, 2) or three (m = 1, 2, 3) 1D cooling cycles one

can proceed with decreasing the temperature in two or three dimensions numerously applying such sets.

Since the time necessary to collect all the atoms in DS is, generally speaking, inﬁnitely large it may be useful to
separate the DS from background with the ﬁnal ﬁrst-step transitions (on one for each dimension), so that the DS
and background atoms will move in opposite directions and will not spatially overlap after a while. In particular,
when vectors ∆m
p , m = 1, 2, 3, form an orthogonal basis, our scheme will produce a cooled atomic beam with average
momentum ∆1
p as it follows from Eq. (2.7). The minimum allowed temperature (but not the intensity) of
such a beam is obviously deﬁned by the width of velocity selection peculiar to ﬁrst-step transitions and therefore can
be much less than the gravitational limit.

III. GROUND-STATE TWO-PHOTON TRANSITIONS

In contrast to the case of Bragg scattering [10,12], where diﬀracted modes are assumed to be spatially resolvable
at some distance from the light standing wave, present paper deals with short interaction times when an atom moves
inside superposition of two laser beams from the beginning to the end. This allows to interpolate each of the beam

B. Approximate formulas

The inverse Laplace transformation of expressions (4.7) (4.9) with the Mellin formula delivers the desired quadrature

solution (m = 1, 2)

Although the integral in Eq. (4.11) can not be calculated explicitly at once, it becomes tabulated after applying some
p′
approximation. Note, that by the retardation theorem the value of ψ{1,2}(p, t) will be nonzero only if t+(pz −

0, what has a clear physical sense: due to the action of force f2 a state with the momentum pz may arise only from
the states which span the interval pz < p′

V. OPTICAL PUMPING

In this section, the optical-pumping beam is considered to be a plane electromagnetic wave (3.1) at m = 2, whose
interaction with atomic sample is described by means of master equation for the density matrix in external potential
(see, e.g., [11]). In the closed family basis [18,19], where density matrix is denoted σab(p1, p2, t), a, b = 1, 2, 3, and
rotating wave approximation the master equation may be rewritten as

VI. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

In the following we show one-dimensional results obtained for Na assuming that all vectors have only z-components,
i.e., lie on one axis with the gravity, and the laser beams with k1 and k2 are counterpropagating. An initial distribution

where p = pz, and σp stands for momentum dispersion (in units of ¯h). Since in our scheme we imply an usage of
atomic sample precooled to the recoil limit it is reasonable to take a wave number k of laser light as an input for σp.
In the numerical simulation of a cooling cycle each ﬁrst-step pulse was followed by ﬁve repetitions of a set, involving
seven Raman and one optical pumping pulses. A mapping between the density matrix at the beginning and end of this
sequence of three-type pulses was given by the formulas (3.2), (3.10), (4.14), and (5.6). Both ﬁrst and second steps of
cooling continued during τ0-times deﬁned according to the Eqs. (3.13) and (4.16) correspondingly. The duration of
the optical pumping pulse was taken 10τp to provide full devastation of the
state. The rest parameters were held
16γ. For the second step: Ω1 = 0.4γ, Ω2 = 0.04γ, and all
as follows. For the ﬁrst step: Ω1 = Ω2 = 0.08γ, and ∆1 =
seven Raman pulses were detuned to the red so that the sum ∆1 + ∆2 =
32γ remained constant while the diﬀerence
∆2 was increased by -135, 118, 372, 625, 880, 1135, and 1393 kHz. Such choice of detunings was tailored both to
∆1 −
span the momentum interval 0
3∆p and to minimize the losses of DS population due to parasitic excitation by
sidelobes in the frequency spectrum of Raman transitions at ϑ < π [see Fig. 2]. For the third step we put Ω2 = 0.1γ,
and ∆2 = 0. Initial size of atomic sample was taken L = 1 cm. However, for given set of Raman light parameters
this or any less value of L leads to the inequality ϑ < π. It means that width of velocity selection is determined by
the Eq. (4.17) and does not depend on L. Therefore our results remain correct for all L

the same time, a peak height growing is far oﬀ saturation, what is depicted in Fig. 4(b). After 100 cooling cycles the

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied a modiﬁcation of Raman cooling method, in which the atomic internal ground state
possesses a translation invariance due to compensation of gravity with the Stern-Gerlach eﬀect. Our scheme has
been based on creating a dark state which is cyclically moved in momentum space with additional velocity-selective
two-photon transitions so that it is kept unreachable for Raman excitation-repumping pulse sequences all the time.
The consideration has been performed for dilute atomic sample, i.e. we have not included any many-atom interactions
[21]. In neglecting of DS losses induced by atomic collisions and photon scattering our one-dimensional numerical
computations have shown that a considerable fraction of all particles can be cooled to the temperature below the
gravitational limit. Furthermore, this temperature can be decreased signiﬁcantly for laser pulses which provide less
width of the velocity selection during DS moving. Though we have given a numerical example only for one-dimensional
model, our theoretical investigation of suggested scheme is also valid for two- and three-dimensional case.

In a bosonic system, where the losses in DS population can be compensated by the quantum-statistical enhancement
of feeding rate, our scheme will be appropriate for dense samples as well. Thus, it may be used in creation of a coherent
atomic-beam generator [16,22]. An easy tunable wavelength will be one of advantages of such device, because the
momentum of cooled atom is readily deﬁned by the geometry of laser beams.

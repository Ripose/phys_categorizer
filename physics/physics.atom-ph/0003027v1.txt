Inelastic collision rates for ultracold 85Rb atoms in the F=2, mf =–2 state have been measured as
a function of magnetic ﬁeld. Dramatic change in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance at 155 G was
observed. Similar to the elastic rate, the inelastic rates show a high peak and a deep trough. Both
two- and three-body processes are important, and individual contributions have been determined and
compared with theory. This work has made it possible to create an 85Rb Bose-Einstein condensate
with a highly adjustable scattering length.

Feshbach resonances have recently been observed in a variety of cold atom interactions, including elastic scattering
[1], radiative collisions and enhanced inelastic loss [2], photoassociation [3], and the loss of atoms from a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) [4]. By changing the magnetic ﬁeld through the resonance, elastic collision rates can be changed
by orders of magnitude and even the sign of the atom-atom interaction can be reversed [5]. The work in Ref. [4]
has received particular attention because the BEC loss rates were extraordinarily high and several proposals for
exotic coherent loss processes have been put forward [6–8]. However, even ordinary dipole relaxation and three-body
recombination are expected to show dramatic enhancements by the Feshbach resonance [9–14], and the calculations
of these ordinary enhancements have never been tested. This has left many outstanding questions as to the nature
of inelastic losses near a Feshbach resonance. How large are the dipole relaxation and three-body recombination
near the Feshbach resonance and how accurate are the calculations of these quantities? How much of the observed
condensate losses in Ref. [4] are due to these more traditional mechanisms and how much arise from processes unique
to condensates? How severe are the“severe limitations” [4] that inelastic loss puts on the use of Feshbach resonances
to change the s-wave scattering length in a BEC? The nature of the inelastic losses near Feshbach resonances also has
important implications for eﬀorts to create BEC in 85Rb, because these losses play a critical role in determining the
success or failure of evaporative cooling. Thus it is imperative to better understand the nature of inelastic collisions
between ground state atoms near a Feshbach resonance.

In this paper we present the study of the losses of very cold 85Rb atoms from a magnetic trap as a function of
density and magnetic ﬁeld. There are two types of inelastic collisions that induce loss from a magnetic trap. The ﬁrst
is dipolar relaxation where two atoms collide and change spin states. The second process is three-body recombination,
where three atoms collide and two of those atoms form a molecule. Measuring the losses as a function of density has
allowed us to determine the two-body and three-body inelastic collision rates, while measuring the variation of these
losses as a function of magnetic ﬁeld has allowed us to ﬁnd out how the Feshbach resonance aﬀects them. In contrast
to the work of Ref. [4] we observe a pronounced dip in the inelastic losses near the Feshbach resonance. This has
allowed us to create 85Rb BECs with a positive scattering length.

To study these losses we needed a cold, dense 85Rb sample. This was obtained through evaporative cooling with a
double magneto-optic trap (MOT) system as described in Ref. [15]. The ﬁrst MOT repeatedly collected atoms from
a background vapor and those atoms were transferred to another MOT in a low-pressure chamber. Once the desired
load size was achieved, the MOTs were turned oﬀ and a baseball-type Ioﬀe-Pritchard magnetic trap was turned on,
resulting in a trapped atom sample of about 3x108 F=2, mf =–2 85Rb atoms at 45 µK. Forced radio-frequency (rf)
evaporation was used to increase the density of the atoms while decreasing the temperature. Because of the high ratio
of inelastic/elastic collision rates in 85Rb and the dependence of the ratio on magnetic ﬁeld (B) and temperature (T ),
trap conditions must be carefully chosen to achieve eﬃcient cooling. We evaporated to the desired temperature and
density (typically 3x1011 cm−3 and 500-700 nK) at a ﬁnal ﬁeld of B=162 Gauss (G).

We then adiabatically changed the DC magnetic ﬁeld to various values and measured the density of the trapped
atom cloud as a function of time. We observed the clouds with both nondestructive polarization-rotation imaging [16]
and destructive absorption imaging. In both cases, the cloud was imaged onto a CCD array to determine the spatial
size and number. The nondestructive method allowed us to observe the time evolution of the number and spatial size
of a single sample. The destructive method required us to prepare many samples and observe them after diﬀerent
delay times, but had the advantages of better signal to noise for a single image and larger dynamic range. A set of
nondestructive imaging data is shown in Fig. 1. In addition to these techniques, we made a redundant check of the

1

number by recapturing the atoms in the MOT and measuring their ﬂuorescence [17].

We measured the time-dependence of the number of atoms and the spatial size, and from these measurements
determined the density. We assigned a 10% systematic error to our density determination, based primarily on the
error in our measurement of number. The value of B was measured in the same way as in Ref. [1]: the rf frequency
at which the atoms in the center of the trap were resonantly spin-ﬂipped was measured and the Breit-Rabi equation
was then used to determine the magnitude of B. The magnetic ﬁeld width of the clouds scaled as T 1/2 and was 0.39
G FWHM at 500 nK.

In each data set we observed the evolution of the sample while a signiﬁcant fraction (20–35%) of the atoms was lost.
The temperature of the sample also increased as a function of time. This heating rate scaled with the inelastic rates
and therefore varied with B. Since the volume and temperature in a magnetic trap are directly related, the change
in the volume (typically 50%) with time was ﬁt to a polynomial—usually a straight line was suﬃcient within our
precision. The number (N) as a function of time was then ﬁt to the sum of three-body and two-body loss contributions
given by

N R n2(x)d3x is the density-weighted density and hn2i = 1

Here hni = 1
N R n3(x)d3x. The time evolution of the volume
is contained in the computation of the density as a function of time. The background loss rate is given by τ . It was
independently determined by looking at low-density clouds for very long times. Typically, it was 450 seconds, with
some modest dependence on B, particularly near the Feshbach resonance.

The change in the combined inelastic rates as a function of B around the Feshbach resonance is shown in Fig. 2(a).
All of the data shown in Fig. 2(a) were taken with initial temperatures near 600 nK. The points less than 157 G were
taken with initial densities within 10% of 1x1011cm−3, while the points higher than 157 G were taken with initial
densities that were 2.7x1011cm−3. The decrease in initial density below 157 G was due to ramping through the high
inelastic loss region after forming the sample at 162 G.

The shape of the inelastic rate vs. B roughly follows that of the elastic rate vs. B [1]. In particular, the peak of
the inelastic rate occurs at 155.4±0.5 G, identical to the position of the elastic peak at 155.2±0.4 G within the error.
Also, just as is the case for the elastic rates, the inelastic loss rates around the Feshbach resonance vary by orders
of magnitude. The peak in the inelastic rate is much less symmetric, however. Another interesting feature is that
the loss rates not only increase near the elastic rate peak but decrease near its minimum. The ﬁeld where the loss is
minimum, 173.8±2.5 G, is higher than the minimum of the elastic rate at 166.8±0.3 G.

Even though the two- and three-body inelastic rates have diﬀerent density dependencies, it is diﬃcult to separate
them. Figure 1 shows how a purely two-body or purely three-body loss curve ﬁts equally well to a typical data set. An
excellent signal-to-noise ratio is, or, equivalently, data from a large range of density are required to determine whether
the loss is three-body, two-body, or a mixture of the two. To better determine density dependence, we decreased the
initial density by up to a factor of 10 for several B values. For ﬁelds with relatively high loss rates, the signal-to-noise
ratio was adequate to distinguish between two- and three-body loss. However, where the rates were lower this was
not the case.

Figure 2(b) shows the two-body inelastic rate determined from the density-varied data and Fig. 2(c) shows the
same for the three-body rate. The character of the inelastic loss clearly changes as one goes from higher to lower ﬁeld
(right to left in Fig. 2). On the far right of the graph, at B = 250 G, the inelastic rate is dominated by a three-body
process. From B = 250 G down to B = 174 G the inelastic rate decreases to a minimum and then begins to increase
again. Near the minimum, we could not determine the loss character, but at 162 G the losses are dominated by a
two-body process. At 158 G the two-body process is still dominant and rising rapidly as one goes toward lower ﬁeld.
However, by ∼157 G it has been overtaken by the three-body recombination that is the dominant process at 157-145
G. At lower ﬁelds, both two-body and three-body rates contribute signiﬁcantly to the total loss at these densities.

Along with varying the density, the initial temperature was varied at B = 145,156,160, and 250 G. There was no
signiﬁcant rate change in the loss rate for temperatures between 400 and 1000 nK for the 160 and 250 G points.
The combined loss rate increased by a factor of 8 at 156 G from 1 µK to 400 nK, and by a factor of 2 at 145 G.
This temperature dependence near the peak is expected in analogy to the temperature dependence of the elastic rates
[18]. The fact that the loss rates near the peak exhibit both a two- and three-body character plus a temperature
dependence and considerable heating make interpreting the data challenging. This introduces additional uncertainty
that is included in the error bars in Fig. 2(a-c).

A calculated dipolar loss rate [12] is compared with the data in Fig. 2(b). Keeping in mind the signiﬁcance of
error bars on a log plot, the agreement is reasonably good. In the region between B = 160 and 167 G where the
determination of K2 is not complicated by three-body loss and temperature dependence, the agreement is particularly
good.

Likewise, we show a prediction of the three-body recombination rate in Fig. 2(c) [10]. It is predicted that the
recombination rate scales as the s-wave scattering length to the fourth power (a4
s) for both positive and negative as,
although with a smaller coeﬃcient for the positive case [9,10,14]. Since as varies across the Feshbach resonance, the
recombination rate is expected to change [19]. Temperature dependence has not been included in the prediction.
Qualitatively, the main features of the predicted three-body recombination match the data. The three-body rate
decreases as as decreases, and it increases rapidly where as diverges at B = 155 G. From 155 G to 167 G, as is
positive and the three-body loss is much smaller than it is at B ﬁelds with a comparable negative as, as expected
from theory. This overall level of agreement is reasonable given the diﬃculties and approximations in calculating
three-body rates.

The marked dependence on B of both the elastic and inelastic rates has important implications for the optimization
of evaporative cooling to achieve BEC in 85Rb. As the density increases through evaporative cooling, the absolute
loss rate, which is already much greater than in 87Rb and Na, becomes larger. Not only are atoms then being lost
from the sample, but additional heat is being produced, which counteracts the cooling. It is true that the absolute
elastic collision rate needed for rethermalization and therefore eﬃcient evaporation also increases with density, but
only up to the density where the mean free path of an atom becomes smaller than the cloud size. Any further increase
in density will only increase the ratio of loss rate to rethermalization rate.

These dependencies add additional complexity to the usual complicated optimization of evaporation. However, by
using the data presented here as a guide, along with the ﬁeld dependence of the elastic cross section of Ref. [1] we
have successfully found a suitable evaporation path to reach BEC. For relatively low densities we evaporate at a ﬁeld
(250 G) well above the Feshbach resonance where elastic rates are high enough compared to background losses and
inelastic rates are fairly low. As the density increases, we move to lower ﬁeld to obtain reduced inelastic losses. At a
ﬁnal ﬁeld of 162 G the balance of thermalization and inelastic loss is such as to allow condensates of several thousand
atoms to be created. In contrast with ﬁeld values away from the Feshbach resonance, here the scattering length is
also positive and so such large condensates are stable [20], and because of the Feshbach resonance their scattering
length is easily varied.

The 85Rb Feshbach resonance has a profound eﬀect on the two- and three-body inelastic rates, changing them by
orders of magnitude. The dependence of the inelastic rates on magnetic ﬁeld is similar in structure to the dependence
of the elastic rate: the maxima in both rates occur at the same ﬁeld, while the minima are close but do not coincide.
The total loss is a complicated mixture of both two- and three-body loss processes. They have diﬀerent dependencies
on ﬁeld so both have ﬁeld regions in which they dominate.

[19] The predicted change in as with ﬁeld is obtained using the potential determined in Ref. [1] by J. P. Burke, Jr. (NIST,
Gaithersburg, private communication). That potential predicts as = -422 bohr away from the Feshbach resonance. Private
communications with C. J. Williams indicate that as = -600 bohr away from the resonance may be more consistent with
all the available Rb data.

FIG. 1. Number of atoms versus time (•) taken by polarization-rotation imaging at 159 G. Fits to both purely two-body
(dashed line) and purely three-body (solid line) inelastic rates are shown, illustrating the diﬃculty in separating two- and
three-body loss processes.

FIG. 2. (a) Elastic rate (upper plot and ◦ symbol) from Ref. [1] and total loss rates vs. magnetic ﬁeld. The total loss rate
is expressed as a sum of the two- and three-body loss as K2 + βK3. Due to initial density diﬀerences caused by ramping across
the peak, β = 1.6 x 1011cm−3 for the points below B=157 G (ﬁlled circles) and 4.0 x 1011cm−3 for the points above (ﬁlled
triangles). The vertical lines represent the positions of the elastic rate maximum and minimum at B=155 G and B=167 G
respectively. (b) The determination of the two-body inelastic rate for several B ﬁelds. The theory prediction from Ref. [12] is
shown as a solid line. The open circles (◦) are the two-body rates determined from the total loss from Fig. 2(a) by assuming
(not explicitly measuring) that the loss between 162 G and 166 G is predominantly two-body. These points are added to aid
in comparison with theory. (c) The determination of the three-body inelastic rate. The points with down arrows ( ↓ ) are to be
interpreted as upper limits on the three-body rate. The solid line here is a prediction of the loss rate from Ref. [10]. The open
circles in Fig. 2(c) are similar to those in 2(b), only in 2(c) we assume (but again do not measure) that the loss above 175 G
is predominantly three-body. The error bars on the 250 G point are relatively small because a large amount of data was taken
there. In addition to the statistical errors shown in Fig. 2(a-c), there is another 10% systematic uncertainty in K2 and 20% in
K3 due to the estimated error in our density determination.

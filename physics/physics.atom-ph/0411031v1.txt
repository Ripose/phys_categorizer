Abstract. Relativistic and QED corrections to the recently discovered ﬁrst
vibrational 2pσu state are presented.
This state has an extremely small
nonrelativistic binding energy EB = 1.085045252(1)×10−9 a.u. Its wave functions
has a maximum at R ≈ 100 a.u. and extends up to several hundreds. It is shown
that this state does not disappear if higher order relativistic and QED corrections,
including the Casimir–Polder eﬀect, are taken into account.

1. Introduction

×

We have recently reported [1, 2, 3] on the possible existence of a new bound state of
the H+
2 molecular ion. It corresponds to the ﬁrst excitation of the 2pσu vibrational
state,
i.e. a state with total three-body orbital angular momentum L = 0 and
with proton-proton spin coupled to Sn = 1. Its binding energy is extremely small,
10−9 a.u. (atomic units) with respect to the p–H dissociation
EB = 1.085045252(1)
threshold, and its wave function extends over several hundreds a.u. Although not
750 a.u.,
being populated, it results into a huge p–H scattering length value of at ≈
which dominates the low energy p–H scattering. Apart from its exotic character, the
very existence of such a state can dramatically modify the p + H
2 + hν reaction
rate and consequently can explain the H2 molecular abundance [4, 5]. Our previous
calculations were done in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Given
the smallness of its binding energy, it is necessary to undertake a systematic study of
the relativistic corrections in order to see to what extent they modify, or even question,
the results previously found. This is the aim of the present paper.

At a ﬁrst glance it may be expected that at very large distances a change of the
asymptotic potential due to the Casimir–Polder (or retardation) eﬀect can lead to

disappearance of this weakly bound state. For the charge–dipole case the asymptotic
potential at distances r

100 a.u. has a form [6]

where αd is the electric dipole polarizability of an atom (for the hydrogen atom
αd = 9/2) and α
1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant. The ﬁrst term is the
classical polarization potential, which results from the instant Coulomb interaction
and is already included in the nonrelativistic solution. The second term represents
the two transverse photon exchange between a neutral system (hydrogen atom) and a
distant charged particle (proton). In order to evaluate the inﬂuence of this contribution
on the binding energy one may use the value of the retardation potential — second
100
term in Eq. (1) — at the maximum of the bound state wave function, Rmax ≈
a.u., that gives:

Vret(rmax) =

max ≈

10−6.
Thus the change of the 2pσu(v = 1) binding energy is of the order ∆Eret = EB ×
The smallness of this quantity suggests that relativistic and QED corrections can be
treated using the standard perturbation technique for bound states, and eventually at
some stage should take in the Casimir–Polder eﬀect.

2. Variational calculation of the nonrelativistic solution

The numerical calculations of the bound state wave function have been performed
using the variational approach described in details in [7]. The variational wave function
for an S state has the form,

In order to get the accurate result we use 5 sets of the basis functions of the
type (2), for which the variational parameters have been searched independently.
The proton-to-electron mass ratio, mp = 1836.152701 me, has been adopted for this
calculations.

In Table 1 we present the convergence of the computed binding energies as a
function of N , number of the basis functions. One can see that the nonrelativistic
binding energy for this weakly bound state has a relative accuracy of 10−9, what is
compliant with the requirements of the precise spectroscopy. The next question is how

to improve this value by taking into account the corrections imposed by a relativistic
theory and QED. These aspects will be discussed in the following sections. As it
was demonstrated in the introduction, these corrections can be evaluated using the
standard perturbation expansion over the parameter α
1/137, which can be derived
from the nonrelativistic QED eﬀective ﬁeld theory [8].

3. Corrections due to the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian

The Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian provide us with the relative α2 order corrections with
respect to the nonrelativistic energy of a state.

The major contribution comes from the relativistic correction for the bound

electron,

As can be seen in the Table 2 the relativistic correction to the binding energy
10−3, what is in agreement with the work of Howells and Kennedy
is of the order
[9]. These authors studied the relativistic corrections for the high vibrational states
of the 1sσg series in H+
2 . They found that the Breit–Pauli relative contribution to the
binding energy of the weakly bound states is of the order 10−3, while in the case of low

Table 2. The Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian corrections (in a.u.) to the binding energy
of the 2pσu(v = 1) state

The uncertainty in the relativistic correction for the bound electron is considerably
larger than other uncertainties in α2 corrections. This is due to the strong cancelation
between the correction terms for the H+
2 molecular ion and the ground state of the
hydrogen atom. The very accurate variational solution, providing the accuracy for the
10−18 a.u., is still not enough to get the precise value
nonrelativistic energy to be
for this relativistic contribution.

2 , the Bethe logarithm was taken equal
to the hydrogenic limit, namely, β(3S, 1)
2.9841. This is justiﬁed since the electronic
wave function for the 2pσu(v = 1) state to a good extent can be approximated by the
antisymmetrized hydrogenic wave function: ψe(r1, r2; R) = (1/√2)(ψH(r1)
ψH(r2))).
On the other hand, this accuracy is suﬃcient to get a relevant estimate of the α3 order
radiative correction.

Our calculations include also the α4 order corrections in a non-recoil limit. Among

The summary of the relativistic and QED contributions up to and including term
of order α4 is presented in Table 3. The uncertainty in the ﬁnal value is determined by
the uncertainty in calculating the leading relativistic correction for the bound electron.
The other corrections have been obtained with much better accuracy.

5. Spin eﬀects

In the preceding evaluations, the spin eﬀects were ignored. For the 2pσu(v = 1) state,
the spin-spin interaction has a form:

6. Conclusions

The relativistic and QED corrections to the 2pσu(v = 1) vibrational state of the H+
2
molecular ion have been evaluated. Calculations include up to α4 order terms.

The main conclusion of this work is that, despite the smallness of its binding
energy, the existence of this state is not questioned by the impact of the relativistic
and radiative eﬀects. By including all these corrections one gets a binding energy
10−8 eV, what represents a
EB = 1.0822198(4)
relative modiﬁcation ∆EB/EB = 2.61

×
10−3 of the nonrelativistic value.

10−9 a.u., or EB = 2.944 870(1)

×

While the nonrelativistic binding energy is now known to a relative precision of
about 10−9, the ﬁnal value for the physical binding energy has an uncertainty by two
orders of magnitude larger. Generally, for the low vibrational ”gerade” states of the
hydrogen isotope molecular ions, the convergence with respect to α is better. The
most conceivable explanation is that, for the weakly bound states, the cancelation of
the diﬀerent correction terms in the molecular ion and the atom has the strongest
eﬀect and this slows down the convergence of the expansion. It manifests already in
the leading order corrections of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian and was observed before
in [9] for the 1sσg series of states.

×

The contribution of the spin-spin interaction is rather small: its magnitude is by

three orders smaller than the relativistic correction for the bound electron.

Finally, we would like to mention that the existence of this weakly bound H+
2
molecular ion state is of fundamental importance. It manifests itself in a huge p–H
scattering length a
[1], which determines the low energy scattering of
proton by atomic hydrogen. The H+
2 formation rate is substantially inﬂuenced by the
p–H resonant cross section. This can help to explain the abnormal abundance of H2
molecules in the interstelar space [4, 5]. Experimental conﬁrmation of the considered
state would be very appreciated, despite being diﬃcult to realize [2].

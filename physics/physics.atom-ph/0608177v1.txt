Abstract. Eﬀects of vacuum polarization modify the energy levels in atoms with an orbiting particle
heavier than an electron. The dominant eﬀect is due to the Uehling potential. In this paper we consider
the relativistic corrections to the energy levels caused by the Uehling potential and in particular the ﬁne
structure in muonic and antiprotonic atoms. We derive general expressions and consider in detail speciﬁc
regions of parameters which allow simple asymptotic expansion. We take into account the recoil eﬀects
and anomalous magnetic moment in the case of an antiproton as the orbiting particle.

1 Introduction

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the en-
ergy levels of bound states have very diﬀerent structure
from one atom to another. The dominant QED eﬀect for
exotic atoms with an orbiting particle heavier than an
electron is due to the so-called Uehling potential, which
is caused by a free electron vacuum polarization loop. In
a previous paper [1] we studied the nonrelativistic eﬀects
which are in particular responsible for the Lamb shift.

In principle, the results were known for a few low-lying
levels for a while [2]; however, they are rather complicated
and the aim of [1] was to derive simple expressions for arbi-
trary states, which may be realized as certain asymptotic
expansions. For instance, the expansions are possible over
a small parameter Zα (where Z is the nuclear charge) and
a large parameter Zα m/n2me (where m is the mass of an
orbiting particle and n is the principal quantum number).
Some other expansions are also possible.

Analysis in [1] was performed in the leading non-re-
lativistic approximation. Here we consider the ﬁrst rela-
tivistic correction. This correction is the dominant QED
contribution to the ﬁne structure and we pay special at-
tention to the ﬁne structure eﬀects in muonic and antipro-
tonic atoms. Certain nonrelativistic asymptotics were pre-
viously studied in [4,5], while in [1] we considered a speciﬁc
case of high n which may be of particular interest due to
antiprotonic atoms.

Here we derive a general expression for the dominant
correction to the Lamb shift at a medium value of the

nuclear charge Z. This correction is j-independent and we
also found a relativistic correction which depends on the
angular momentum j. Finally, the vacuum polarization
corrections are presented in the form

∆E(nlj) =

The ﬁrst term (the F -term) is responsible for most of the
Lamb shift and was already studied in detail in [1]. The
relativistic correction (the H-term) is a small correction
to the Lamb shift, but it is responsible for the dominant
radiative contribution to the ﬁne structure, which we de-
= j′ while n = n′ and
ﬁne here as splitting for the case of j
l = l′. Due to that we consider in detail the ﬁne-structure
diﬀerence

The exact calculation can be performed and analytic
results for certain states were found in [4]. Here, at the ﬁrst
stage we derive a similar expression for an arbitrary state
in a hydrogen-like atom. Applying the known expression
for the wave function of the Dirac-Coulomb equation (see,
e.g., [3]) and integrating over coordinates, we obtain

are known in a closed form [1] (cf. [4]):

Such expressions containing the hypergeometric func-

ent; however, various simpler asymptotic expressions are
known [4,5,1]. Here we intend to expand in Zα. The lead-
ing term of the ∆E(nlj) expansion in Zα (see the F term
in (1)) was studied by us in detail previously [1] (see also
[5]). Now, we derive from Eq. (4) the leading relativistic
correction to ∆E(0)(nlj), related to the H term in (1).

Various high-κ asymptotics of Kabc were studied pre-
viously and applying (11) to the low-lying states we derive
results for the relativistic correction Hnlj, which are pre-
sented in Table 1 for states with j = l + 1/2. Separately
we present in Table 2 the asymptotic results related to
the diﬀerence ∆FS
nl deﬁned in Eq. (3). The diﬀerence is
the leading Uehling contribution to the ﬁne structure and
thus it is the part of Hnlj(x) of most interest.

4 Results for the near circular states

The general expression (11) contains a double summation.
However, for circular (l = n
1, j = l + 1/2) and near
circular states only a few terms contribute to the sum and
1, the
the result is relatively simple. In the limit κn ≫

One feature of most exotic atoms is that a gap between
the mass of the orbiting particle m and of the nucleus M
is not so large as in a conventional atom (where m = me
and thus m/M
1/(1836 A), where A is the mass num-
ber). As a result, various recoil eﬀects become important.
Another important property of some exotic atoms is the
presence of the anomalous magnetic moment of the orbit-
ing particle, which is not small. There are two kinds of
orbiting particles with spin 1/2 which can be described
by the Dirac equation. While the recoil eﬀects are impor-
tant for both muonic and antiprotonic atoms, the eﬀects
of the non-zero anomalous magnetic moment take place

muon anomalous magnetic moment can be treated per-
turbatively and taken into account together with related
radiative corrections.

We also note that the ﬁne structure is considered as a
structure of levels due to the interaction of the spin of the
orbiting particle and the orbital moment. In this consid-
eration we neglect the nuclear magnetic moment and thus
the hyperﬁne eﬀects. If the nucleus has a spin, the energy
should be averaged over it to be compared to our result.
Such an asymmetric treatment is reasonable when the nu-
cleus is either spinless or heavier than the orbiting particle
and cannot be applied to, e.g., protonium, a bound system
of a proton and antiproton. In the case of heavy nuclei it
is customary to separate the ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure
and for this case we consider below the recoil eﬀects in the
ﬁne-structure splitting.

Below we take into account the ﬁnite nuclear mass and
anomalous magnetic moment of the orbiting particles. To
do that we re-visit the well-known leading contributions
to the ﬁne structure, found perturbatively, and show that
their dependence on the nuclear mass and the anomalous
magnetic moment of the orbiting particle is of a universal
form. That allows us to adjust the results for ∆FS.

Above we calculated the leading contribution to the

in the external ﬁeld approximation and neglecting the
muon anomalous magnetic moment.

Now, we explain how to take into account the ﬁnite
mass of the nucleus and its anomalous magnetic moment
for the ﬁne structure. Similar eﬀects are also important
for relativistic corrections in general; however, the general
case is much more complicated and will be considered else-
where.

The explicit results for ∆FS

nl (κn) were found here by ap-
plying the Dirac equation. Let us consider this particular
eﬀect perturbatively. In the case of κ′ = 0 and m/M = 0
we start from a Hamiltonian

is the complete nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for the prob-
lem V (r) = VC (r)+ VU (r), mR is the reduced mass, which
in the limit m/M = 0 is equal to the particle mass m, and
the ﬁne-structure eﬀects are described by the potential

In terms of the eigenfunctions Ψ 0

We note that if the potential V (r) depends neither on

M , the wave function can depend only on the reduced
mass mR because of the kinetic energy and on me in the
particular case of the Uehling potential.

What happens if we take into account the anomalous

The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian is now of the same form
as before (see (27) ) but the reduced mass

splitting and for a contribution to it in any order in α once
we consider a perturbation of the Coulomb potential by the
Uehling potential. In our case, only a term linear in α is needed.

This result follows from dimentioanl analyses in (31) once
we take into account all m-factors in (32). It includes the
complete mass dependence and the anomalous magnetic

8 Summary

There is a wide variety of exotic atoms, which have been or
may be successfully produced; however, only in two kinds
of such atoms the orbiting particle has spin 1/2, namely
in muonic and antiprotonic atoms. In this paper we study
ﬁne structure caused by the interaction of the spin of the
orbiting particle and the orbital moment. Eﬀects of the
nuclear spin and magnetic moment are neglected. That
is basically correct in two cases. Firstly, one can study
an exotic atom with a spinless nucleus. Secondly, one can
consider the energy averaged over the nuclear spin. The
latter is correct as an approximation and the corrections
enter in order (m/M )2.

Concluding, we present here expressions for the ﬁne
splitting in both muonic and antiprotonic atoms which
consist of the leading term and the Uehling correction and
properly include the anomalous magnetic moment and re-
coil eﬀects.

Below we summarize results known in closed analytic
form for antiprotonic and muonic atoms. While the kine-
matic corrections discussed in the previous section are
well-known, in this paper we found various presentations
for the leading radiative correction (∆FS

nl ) in Sects. 3–5.

4 We apply here the dimensional analysis only to a term
linear in perturbation VU ; however, the scaling factor, which
takes into account the nuclear mass and the anomalous mag-
netic moment of the orbiting particle, is correct in any order
and for any nonrelativistic potential, as long as the latter does
not explicitly depend on m or M .

for high κn. The higher order corrections include a small
factor which is either α or (Zα)2.

The QED result above does not include any nucleus-
related eﬀects such as the ﬁnite-size eﬀects, virtual QED
annihilation eﬀects and eﬀects of strong interactions. The
latter may be dominant for low-l states. On the contrary,
for higher-l states the dominant correction to the ﬁne
structure is determined by the equations above.

The higher order corrections include a small factor
which is either α or (Zα)2. Some of them have been known
only for a few particular cases, but not in general. The
higher order eﬀects for some particular situations are re-
viewed, e.g., in [10,11].

The diﬀerence with antiprotonic atoms is a perturba-
tive treatment of the anomalous magnetic moment of the
orbiting particle. The accuracy of the muonic expression
is higher than in the antiprotonic case, because of lack
of the direct strong interaction and smaller importance of
the nuclear ﬁnite-size eﬀects because of a larger average
distance between the orbiting particle and the nucleus.

Abstract

We present a summarizing account of a series of inves-
tigations whose central topic is to address the ques-
tion whether atomic stabilization exists in an ana-
lytical way. We provide new aspects on several is-
sues of the matter in the theoretical context when
the dynamics is described by the Stark Hamiltonian.
The main outcome of these studies is that the gov-
erning parameters for this phenomenon are the total
classical momentum transfer and the total classical
displacement. Whenever these two quantities vanish,
asymptotically weak stabilization does exist. For all
other situations we did not ﬁnd any evidence for sta-
bilization. We found no evidence that strong stabi-
lization might occur. Our results agree qualitatively
with the existing experimental ﬁndings.

Introduction

Due to the breakdown of standard perturbation the-
ory, the understanding of the physics of an atom in
1016W cm−2
a strong (intensities larger than 3.5
for typical frequencies) laser ﬁeld is still poorly un-
derstood to a very large extent. Hitherto the large
majority of the obtained results is based on numerical
treatments. In our investigations we aim at a rigor-
ous analytical description of phenomena occurring in

this regime. This proceeding will provide an account
of a series of publications [1-4]. In many cases we will
simply summarize and state some of the results and
refer the reader for a detailed derivation to the origi-
nal manuscripts, but we shall try to put an emphasis
on new aspects for which we will supply an extensive
discussion. Several of the presented arguments and
results may not be found in [1-4].

Amongst the phenomena occurring in the high in-
tensity regime in particular the one of so-called sta-
bilization has recently caused some controversy, not
only concerning its deﬁnition, but even its very exis-
tence altogether [5-25]. Roughly speaking stabiliza-
tion means that atomic bound states become resistent
to ionization in ultra-intense laser ﬁelds. A more pre-
cise deﬁnition may be found in section 2.2.

2 Physical Framework

The object of our investigations is an atom in the
presence of a suﬃciently intense1 laser ﬁeld, which
may be described in the non-relativistic regime by the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in the dipole
approximation

eral form E(t) = E0f (t), where E0 denotes the ﬁeld
amplitude and f (t) is some arbitrary function which
equals zero for t < 0 and t > τ , such that τ deﬁnes
the pulse length. Depending on the context it is con-
venient to express the Hamiltonian in equation (1) in
diﬀerent gauges.

2.1 Gauge equivalent Hamiltonians

Taking Aj←i(t) to be a one parameter family of uni-
tary operators, we may construct the gauge equiv-
alent Hamiltonian Hi (t) from Hj (t) by the usual
gauge transformation

Hi(t) = i∂tAj←i(t)A−1

j←i(t) + Aj←i(t)Hj (t)A−1

j←i(t).

Choosing the most conventional gauge, the so-called
length gauge, the Hamiltonian to describe the above
mentioned physical situation is the Stark Hamilto-
nian

track of the particular gauge we are in and to identify
a speciﬁc Hamiltonian, respectively. In our conven-
tions ~p and ~x denote operators, whilst ~p and ~x are
elements in R3. Other commonly used Hamiltonians
are the one in the velocity gauge

which are the classical momentum transfer, the clas-
sical displacement and the classical energy transfer,
respectively. It will turn out, that in particular b (τ )
and c (τ ) are the crucial parameters for the descrip-
tion of the phenomenon we are going to discuss. The
classical energy transfer a(t) is not a crucial quantity
since it enters all expressions only as a phase and will
therefore cancel in all relevant physical expressions.

or in the electric ﬁeld, respectively. Of course these

2.2 Deﬁnition of Stabilization

Since stabilization means diﬀerent things to diﬀerent
authors and a universally accepted concept does not
seem to exist yet, we will precisely state our deﬁni-
tion of it. We will not discuss the behaviour of ion-
ization rates as some authors do, but we shall con-
sider exclusively ionization probabilities. Denoting
2d3x the usual Hilbert

where H± = limt→±∞ H(t), ψ is a normalized bound
state of H−, P± is the projector onto the bound state
space of H± and U (t, t′) is the time evolution op-
erator from time t′ to t associated2 to H(t). The
time evolution operators may be transformed from
one gauge to another by

case of equality and strict inequality. If the former
sign holds we call this behaviour “weak stabilization”
and in the latter case “strong stabilization”. In case

weak stabilization only occurs in the limit E0 → ∞
we shall refer to it as “asymptotically weak stabiliza-
tion”.

However, (recall that b (0) = c (0) = 0), equality in
the ﬁrst case holds whenever we have b (τ ) = 0 and
in both cases when in addition c (τ ) = 0. We will
encounter this condition of a particularly switched
on and oﬀ pulse below once more as the necessary
condition for the presence of what we refer to as
asymptotically weak stabilization 3. We would like
to point out that this condition does not coincide
necessarily with the notion of adiabatically switched
on and oﬀ pulses, because we may achieve b (τ ) = 0
and c (τ ) = 0 of course also with a very rapid switch
on and oﬀ. Since we are interested in the behaviour
of the atomic bound states

3 Upper and lower bounds for
the Ionization Probability

The outcome of every theoretical investigation will
attach some sort of error to any physical quantity.
In the minority of cases this error can be precisely
stated, since it may either be the consequence of var-
ious qualitative assumptions based on some physical
reasoning which are diﬃcult to quantify or it may be
of a more technical nature originating in the method
used. For instance for the physical quantity we are in-
terested in, the ionization probability P (ψ), the most
fundamental error is introduced by the assumptions
for the validity of the main physical framework, that
is the Schr¨odinger equation (1) (i.e. non-relativity,
dipole approximation, classical treatment of the ex-
ternal ﬁeld, neglect of the magnetic ﬁeld, etc.). Ex-
amples for errors rooted in a particular method used
are: When solving the Schr¨odinger equation numeri-
cally one is forced to discretise H(t), insert the atom
into a ﬁnite box and introduce absorbing mask func-
tions at the boundary, etc. Also one is not able to
project on all bound states or all states of the “dis-
crete continuum”4 and is forced to introduce a cut-
oﬀ, whose eﬀect is in our opinion not discussed in
the literature. Some further examples are the errors
resulting from the termination of a Floquet, Fourier
expansion or perturbation series5. We would like the
reader to keep these basic facts in mind, i.e. “ex-
act” results do not exist and one is always dealing
with some form of bounds, when judging about the
method presented in this section. The essence of the
method consists in treating bounds which restrict a
physical quantity rather than looking at its actual

value. One of the main virtues of this approach is
that it may be carried out purely analytically.
In
diﬀerent contexts it has turned out to be extremely
fruitful, for instance in the proof of the stability of
matter [29] and the stability of matter in a magnetic
ﬁeld [30].

We will provide rigorous analytic expressions for
the upper and lower bound, Pu(ψ) and Pl(ψ), re-
spectively, for the ionization probability in the sense
that

Pl(ψ)

Pu(ψ) .

≤

(19)

Hence within the basic theoretical framework upper
and lower bounds serve as sharp error bars. Surely
one should treat these expressions with care and be
aware of their limitations in the sense that about the
actual shape of P (ψ) no decisive conclusion can be
drawn whenever Pl(ψ) diﬀers strongly from Pu(ψ).
However, it seems a reasonable assumption that the
analytic expression of the bounds reﬂect qualitatively
the behaviour of the precise ionization probability.
Nonetheless, there exist certain type of questions in
the present context which can be answered decisively
with this method. Concerning the question of stabi-
lization we may consider the bounds as functions of
the ﬁeld amplitude and can conclude that stabiliza-
tion exists or does not exist once we ﬁnd that Pu(ψ)
for increasing ﬁeld amplitude tends to zero and Pl(ψ)
tends to one, respectively. Unfortunately, one does
not always succeed in deriving analytic expressions
which are of this restrictive form.

Our method allows in principle to consider any bound
state, but initially we restricted ourselves to s-wave
functions, keeping however the dependence on the
principal quantum number n. The discussion of (21)
and (22) in [1] was plagued by the requirement that
the pulse duration should be fairly small. This limi-
tation, which ensured that bounds for the ionization
probability are between zero and one, was overcome
in [2], since in there we had an additional parameter,
i.e. n, at hand. As the expressions (23) and (24)
show after a quick inspection, one may achieve that
their values remain physical, even if one increases the
pulse duration, but now together with n.

In particular we investigated the eﬀect resulting
from diﬀerent pulse shapes, since it is widely claimed
in the literature that a necessary condition for the

4

existence of stabilization is an adiabatically smooth
turn on (sometimes also oﬀ) of the laser ﬁeld. For
deﬁniteness we assumed the laser light to be of the
general form E(t) = E0 sin(ωt)g(t). Besides other
pulses we investigated in particular the ones which
are widely used in the literature, where the envelop-
ing function is either trapezoidal

This means that in the former case we have asymp-
totically weak stabilization. It should be noted that
in this analysis the pulse shape is kept ﬁxed, such that
adiabaticity can not be guaranteed anymore. Hence,
weak stabilization is found for a situation in which
it is generally not expected to occur.
It would be
very interesting to perform similar computations as
in [3] in which the pulse shape is varied in order to
keep also adiabaticity and study whether the eﬀect
will become enhanced in any way. Furthermore, in
this case the time evolution operator coincides with

Since we are interested in very high intensities we ex-
pect to be able to draw some conclusions from the ex-
pressions for the ionization probability in which the
ﬁeld amplitude is taken to its ultra-extreme limit,
In particular we may decide whether
i.e.
asymptotic stabilization exists. Despite the fact that
in this regime one should commence with a relativis-
tic treatment, our physical framework, that is the
Schr¨odinger equation (1) remains self-consistent, and
should certainly represent the overall behaviour. In
[3] we rigorously take this limit under certain gen-
eral assumptions on the atomic potential7 and the

Theory

In the high intensity regime for the radiation ﬁelds,
the basic assumption for the validity of conventional
perturbation theory breaks down, i.e. that the abso-
lute value of the potential is large in comparison with
the absolute value of the ﬁeld. However, there is a re-
placement for this, the so-called Gordon-Volkov (GV)
perturbation theory [31]. Since the basic idea is sim-
ple, it makes this approach very attractive. Instead

together with a = S and b = A in (30) yields the
usual perturbation series, which is well known from
the low intensity regime. One may also decide for a
rather strange procedure and take the latter choice
in the ﬁrst iterative step and terminate the series af-

For i = l or i = v, this procedure is sometimes
referred to as the Keldysh- [32] or Faisal-Reiss [33]
approximation, respectively. As we demonstrated
this method is of course not “exact”, as sometimes
wrongly stated in the literature.

There are some exact results which may be derived
from the perturbative expression, one concerning the
ultra-extreme intensity limit of the previous section
and the other the ultra-extreme high frequency limit.
Both results are simple consequences of the Riemann-
Lebesgue theorem8. We obtain

Since the atomic potential is independent of E0 we
obtain with (36) that the entire Gordon-Volkov series

We have therefore weak stabilization in this ultra-
extreme high frequency limit for all systems for which
(31) makes sense and for which the laser ﬁeld is of the
form E(t) = E0 sin(ωt)g(t). One should keep in mind
that the use of the Stark Hamiltonian in (1) assumes
the validity of the dipole approximation, such that
the limit ω
(a slightly milder assumption was
used in the seminal paper [6] which formulates the
high frequency approach) only makes formally sense.
In order to describe real physics in this frequency
regime one should actually also take multipole terms
into account. This is a further example of the errors
we mentioned at the beginning of section 3.

this term into a form suitable for the application of
the Riemann-Lebesgue theorem, such that the zeroth
order matrix element always vanishes in the ultra-
extreme intensity limit. For the higher order terms
the argument is analogous with the diﬀerence that
the condition b(τ ) = c(τ ) = 0 does not have the con-
sequence that these expressions become independent
of E0, since also terms like b(t), c(t) for 0 < t < τ
appear. Hence by the application of the Riemann-
Lebesgue theorem all higher order terms vanish in

This analysis allows us to determine the error which
is introduced by the termination of the GV-series.
Usually this is done without any justiﬁcation about
the precision and the only reasoning provided is very
often solely the comparison with the next order term.
This is however not enough as one knows from simple
rest term estimations in a Taylor expansion.

This means we have asymptotically weak stabiliza-

(56) is not only obtained by an alternative method
but also covers an additional case. As we already
observed, a diﬀerent physical behaviour is obtained
depending on the values of b(τ ) and c(τ ) and it is
therefore instructive to treat several cases separately:

Hence the problem to compute the ionization prob-
ability has been reduced to solving (46) and subse-
quently evaluate (62). Surely this is not possible to

perform entirely in an analytical way, but the initial
problem has now been reduced to a numerical task,
whose error is well under control. In [4] we carried
out this analysis for a pulse involving the trapezoidal
enveloping function. We do not ﬁnd any evidence for
strong stabilization even for b(τ ) = 0 and c(τ ) = 0,
however, asymptotically weak stabilization exists for
the latter case.

The main outcome of our investigations is that the
governing parameters for the behaviour of an atom in
an intense laser ﬁeld are the total classical momen-
tum transfer b(τ ) and the total classical displacement
c(τ )10. Whenever both these two quantities vanish,
asymptotically weak stabilization does exist. For all
other cases we did not ﬁnd any evidence for stabiliza-
tion.

Since our ﬁndings apparently diﬀer from many the-
oretical results other authors obtained by alternative
methods we would like comment on possible resolu-
tions for this discrepancy:

Introducing a cut-oﬀ in the number of bound states
will produce an upper bound for the ionization proba-
bility. In case one ﬁnds stabilization for such a bound
one could conﬁdently conclude that this eﬀect indeed
exists. Since for lower intensities one can certainly ex-
pect this bound to be relatively close to the real value,
whereas for higher intensities this bound should de-
crease even more.

The introduction of a cut-oﬀ (e.g. equation (3) in
[12]) in the “discrete continuum” (besides the fact
that this is an ill-deﬁned concept) yields a lower
bound for the real ionization probability, which is ex-
pected to be relatively accurate for low intensities
but very far from the real value for high intensities.
Hence keeping the cut-oﬀ ﬁxed and interpreting the
result obtained in this way as “exact”, one has cer-
tainly introduced an artiﬁcial mechanism to “create”

10Some authors claim [37] that for a pulse of the form (25)
b(T ) and c(T ) should be relevant parameters. Besides the fact
that for a smoothly diﬀerentiable pulse (e.g. (26)) these quan-
tities are not precisely deﬁned they do not emerge in our anal-
ysis as signiﬁcant.

stabilization.

A further approach is based on the Fourier expan-
sion of the Hamiltonian in the KH-gauge and there-
after simply keeping the lowest terms. The way this,
in principle legitimate, method is carried out makes
conceptual assumptions which are in clear conﬂict to
our main physical framework. For instance the basic
Hamiltonian used in [22] (equation (1) therein) is in
our notation H S
KH(t) for an instantaneously switched
on monochromatic laser pulse, i.e. E(t) = E0 cos(ωt).
However, the authors of [22] claim stabilization to ex-
ist for pulses with a smooth adiabatic turn on and oﬀ
(gaußian enveloping function). Clearly equation (6)
in [22] breaks the gauge invariance discussed in sec-
tion 2.1. of our manuscript, such that the authors
consider an entirely diﬀerent system. In other words
the Hamiltonian (6) in [22] is not gauge equivalent to
H S
l (t) for a laser pulse with gaußian enveloping func-
tion. The potential in H S
KH (t) is shifted by c(t) and
not E(t). From our point of view the ﬁndings of the
authors are not surprising since they artiﬁcially im-
pose that c(τ ) = 0, (we also ﬁnd asymptotically weak
stabilization in this case) such that one should solve
the inverse problem in this case to ﬁnd out which
pulse is really considered there. However, even under
these assumptions we would still not ﬁnd strong sta-
bilization. The same “procedure” is used for instance
in [23, 24].

Concerning the investigations which do not ﬁnd
any evidence for stabilization at all, we would like to
make the following comment on the use of the GV-
perturbation theory.
In the last reference of [7] a
pulse with instantaneous switch on was used in this
context, i.e. E(t) = E0 cos(ωt), and an analysis up to
ﬁrst order GV-perturbation theory was carried out.
Typical parameters in [7] were α = 1/2, E0 = 5, ω =
1.5 and the pulse length was 2 cycles, that is τ
8.
For these parameters we obtain for the relative max-
8.44, such that we do not expect the
imal error µ
GV-perturbation series to be a good approximation
up to this order and statements made in this context
should be treated with extreme care.

∼

≈

We would like to conclude with a remark on the
existing experimental ﬁndings [38]. So far the experi-
ments carried out only ﬁnd evidence for asymtotically
weak stabilization and conﬁrmations for the existence

of strong stabilization do not exist to our knowledge.
We are therefore in complete qualitative (it is diﬃcult
to determine which values b(τ ) and c(τ ) have for the
experimentally employed pulses (see also footnote 3
for this)) agreement with the existing experiments.

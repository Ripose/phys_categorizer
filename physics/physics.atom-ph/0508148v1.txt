We have studied collisional perturbations of radio-frequency (rf) electric-dipole (E1) transitions
between the nearly degenerate opposite-parity levels in atomic dysprosium (Dy) in the presence of
10 to 80 µTorr of H2, N2, He, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe. Collisional broadening and shift of the resonance,
as well as the attenuation of the signal amplitude are observed to be proportional to the foreign-gas
density with the exception of H2 and Ne, for which no shifts were observed. Corresponding rates
and cross sections are presented. In addition, rates and cross sections for O2 are extracted from
measurements using air as foreign gas. The primary motivation for this study is the need for accurate
determination of the shift rates, which are needed in a laboratory search for the temporal variation
of the ﬁne-structure constant [A. T. Nguyen, D. Budker, S. K. Lamoreaux, and J. R. Torgerson,

INTRODUCTION

and Szudy and Baylis [9].

Perturbations of atomic resonance lines by collisions
with atoms were ﬁrst observed by Michelson [1]. With
the impact approximation, Lorentz [2] and Weisskopf [3]
framework. While
provided the earliest theoretical
Lorentz treated the eﬀects of collisions as a complete ter-
mination of a radiation wave train emitted by the atom,
Weisskopf realized that a disruption in phase was suﬃ-
cient to explain broadening. However, neither approach
was able to explain shifts of the atomic resonances. Lind-
holm [4] and Foley [5] remedied this shortcoming with the
adiabatic impact approximation theory which takes into
account the eﬀects of distant collisions that induce small
phase changes ignored by Weisskopf. While this the-
ory is able to predict the line shape near the resonance,
the conditions necessary for its validity break down near
the wings or at higher pressures where satellite lines and
asymmetries have been observed. The initial theory for
satellite lines, called the quasistatic approach, was devel-
oped by Khun [6]. In this approach, the motion of the
perturber is ignored. The line shape is obtained by av-
eraging the change in the energy diﬀerence between the
atomic levels due to the presence of the perturber over
the probability distribution of the stationary perturbers.
However, this theory breaks down for frequencies near
resonance or at low pressures. Since then, these failures
have been alleviated by full quantum-mechanical treat-
ments, developed to unify these two approaches. These
techniques and related experiments are reviewed, for ex-
ample, by Ch’en and Takeo [7], Allard and Kielkopf [8],

In this study, we investigate collisional perturbations
of radio-frequency transitions between the nearly degen-
erate opposite parity levels of 162Dy and 163Dy (Z=66)
due to the introduction of H2, N2, He, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe
at pressure ranging from 10 to 80 µTorr. While broad-
ening and shift rates, and corresponding cross sections
are presented for 162Dy, only shift results are presented
for 163Dy due to large statistical uncertainties resulting
from the dilution of the level population by hyperﬁne
levels. Rates and cross sections due to O2 are extracted
from measurements using air as foreign gas. In addition,
upper bounds on collisional-quenching cross sections are
extracted from observations of the signal amplitude as a
function of foreign-gas pressure.

The system under consideration is unusual

for a
collisional study since the foreign-gas pressures are
. 80 µTorr. In this pressure regime, the time between
collisions is longer than the total transit time of the Dy
atoms across the apparatus, assuming a typical cross sec-
tion of 10−14 cm2. The only other study of collisional
perturbations in Dy that we are aware of was performed
with a magnetic trap where the spin relaxation of the
ground-state Zeeman sublevels due to He was investi-
gated [10].

The primary motivation for this study is the need
for accurate determination of the shift rates which are
important for a search for the temporal variation of
the ﬁne-structure constant, α [11]. Recently, astrophys-
ical evidence of variation in α on cosmological time
scales from quasar absorption spectra has sparked in-
terest in laboratory searches (see,
for example, Refs.
[12, 13, 14, 15]). While the astrophysical evidence [16]
corresponds to ˙α/α = (7.2 ± 1.8) × 10−16/yr assuming a
linear shift over 1010 years, the best laboratory limit of
| ˙α/α| < 1.2 × 10−15/yr was obtained from a comparison

FIG. 1: Relevant levels and transitions in atomic dysprosium. Population and detection scheme: Level B is populated in a
three-step process. The atoms are excited to level f in the ﬁrst two steps using 833- and 699-nm laser light (solid arrows). The
third step is a spontaneous decay (labeled by a short-dashed arrow) from level f to level B with ∼ 30 % branching ratio. The
population is transferred to level A by the rf electric ﬁeld (curved long-dashed lines). Atoms in level A decay to level c and
then to the ground state. The ﬂuorescence from the second decay (564 nm) is used for detection. Inset: Hyperﬁne structure of

of a Hg+ optical clock to a Cs microwave clock [13].

Recent calculations [17] have shown that the nearly
degenerate opposite-parity levels in atomic dysprosium
(Fig. 1, levels A and B) are highly sensitive to varia-
tions in α. In Ref. [11], a possible ultimate experimental
sensitivity of | ˙α/α| ∼ 10−18/yr was estimated for this
system from an analysis of statistical and systematic un-
certainties. In order to realize this level of sensitivity, the
transition frequencies must be kept stable to a mHz level
over a period of a year. Thus, knowledge of collisional
shift rates is critical for the determination of the maxi-
mum allowable pressure in the vacuum chamber and, if
necessary, for correction of the frequency measurements.
In Section II, we describe the technique used to mea-
sure transition frequencies and the procedure used dur-
ing collisional-perturbation measurements. Section III
presents the results and the details of the analysis. Sec-
tion IV considers various systematic uncertainties.
In
Section V, we extract broadening and shift cross sec-
tions. In Section VI we present the implications for the
α-variation experiment.

II. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE

A. Overview

The energy diﬀerence between the nearly degenerate
levels considered in Refs. [17] and [11] are on the or-
der of hyperﬁne splittings (Fig. 1 inset) and isotope
shifts. Since Dy has seven stable isotopes, there are many

rf transitions. The 235-MHz 162Dy (4f95d26s J=10 →
4f105d6s J=10) transition and the 3.1-MHz (F=10.5 →
F=10.5) transition are used for the α-variation experi-
ment due to practical considerations such as high count-
ing rate and low frequency, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 1, the population transfer from the ground state to
the long-lived (τB > 200 µs [18]) odd-parity level B re-
quires three transitions. The ﬁrst two transitions are in-
duced via 833- and 669-nm laser light, while the last tran-
sition is a spontaneous decay with a ∼ 30 % branching
ratio [19]. Atoms are transferred to the even-parity level
A (τA=7.9 µs [18]) with a frequency-modulated rf electric
ﬁeld referenced to a commercial Cs frequency standard.
The transition frequency is determined via a lock-in tech-
nique by monitoring the 564-nm ﬂuorescence.

B. Apparatus

In this section, we describe the atomic-beam appara-
tus, the optical setup, and the detection and pressure-
measurement systems.

A detailed description of the atomic-beam source is
given in Ref. [19]. The beam is produced by an eﬀusive
oven with a multislit nozzle-array operating at ∼ 1500 K.
The oven consists of a molybdenum tube containing dys-
prosium metal, surrounded by resistive heaters made
from tantalum wire inside alumina ceramic tubes. The
radiation shielding is provided by ﬁve layers of tantalum
sheets surrounding the oven and the heaters. In addition
to the multislit nozzle, two external collimators are used

to collimate the atomic beam and the oven light. The lat-
ter is necessary to minimize the background due to scat-
tered oven light. The resulting atomic beam has a mean
velocity of ∼ 5 × 104 cm/s with a full-angle divergence of
∼ 0.2 rad (1/e2 level) in both transverse directions.

The atoms enter the interaction region (Fig. 2), where
they are ﬁrst transferred to level B by two laser-induced
transitions and a spontaneous decay. Approximately
600 mW of 833-nm light is produced by a Ti:Sapphire
ring laser (Coherent 899) pumped by 15 W of Ar ion laser
light (Coherent Innova 400). A ring dye laser (Coherent
699) with DCM [4-(Dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-
dimethlaminostyryl)-4H-pyran] dye produces ∼ 300 mW
of 669-nm light. The dye laser is pumped by an Ar ion
laser (Coherent Innova 300) operating at 6 W of power.
Since the population transfer of a weakly collimated
atomic beam due to narrow-band cw lasers is ineﬃcient,
an adiabatic passage technique is utilized to transfer
atoms to level B. A detailed description of this tech-
nique and references to earlier work are given in Ref. [20].
Brieﬂy, cylindrical lenses are used to diverge the two
laser beams in the interaction region such that the di-
vergences of the light beams match the atomic-beam di-
vergence. Due to the Doppler eﬀect, the atoms “see”
a chirp in laser-frequency detuning which adiabatically
transfers the population to the excited state.

The rf electric ﬁeld is formed between two paral-
lel, 10 cm by 5 cm, wire grids made of 0.002-in Be-
Cu wire. The separation between adjacent wires is 2.5
mm which minimizes surface area and hence surface-
charge accumulation. The separation between the grids is
∼ 2.5 cm. The entire assembly is enclosed inside a high-
permeability magnetic shield which reduces the magnetic
ﬁeld in the interaction region to ∼ 1 mG. The 564-nm ﬂu-

clocks have a long term stability of ∼ 10−11. The output of
the synthesizer is ampliﬁed and then sent to the electric-ﬁeld

the larger impedance of the plates. The output of the pho-
tomultiplier tube is sent to the lock-in ampliﬁer for detection
and acquisition.

orescence is collected by a lucite light pipe and detected
with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) with bandpass inter-
ference and short-pass ﬁlters at the input window.

The rf-generation and detection system is shown in
Fig. 3. The frequency-modulated rf ﬁeld is generated by
a synthesizer (Hewlett Packard 8647A) and sent through
a 45-dB ampliﬁer (ENI 604L). The rf power at the out-
put is ∼ 0.5 W. The synthesizer is referenced to a Cs
frequency standard (Hewlett Packard 5061A) with a long
term stability (>100 s) of 10−11. This frequency standard
is compared to a second clock (Symmetricom TS2700)
to monitor its stability. A Signal Recovery 7265 lock-in
ampliﬁer provides a 10-kHz modulation signal to the rf
synthesizer and demodulates the signal from the PMT.
The signal from the lock-in along with the clock, pres-
sure, and temperature data are sent to a computer for
data acquisition.

The pressure measurement is provided by a residual
gas analyzer (SRS RGA 200) and a capacitance manome-
ter (MKS Baratron 690A.01). The residual gas analyzer
(RGA) is used to monitor partial pressures of the back-
ground gasses. However, due to unknown gas-species-
dependent sensitivity factors,
it is not well suited to
measuring the absolute pressure of various gases. The
manometer, on the other hand, is capable of absolute
pressure measurement in a wide range of pressures from
0.1 Torr to a few µTorr with a resolution of 10−7 Torr.
Measurements have shown that the manometer response

is nonlinear below 10 µTorr. Thus, the total manometer
pressure was limited to 20 µTorr during the collisional-
perturbation measurements. The manometer signal is
processed by a signal conditioner (MKS 670B) which
includes an active heater control mechanism to stabi-
lize the operating temperature. To further reduce noise,
the manometer is mechanically isolated by a vibration-
isolation mount at the base and by the use of ﬂexible
bellows to connect to the vacuum chamber. The mea-
sured statistical uncertainty in the pressure range used
during measurements is ∼ 1 µTorr for 100 seconds of
integration.

C. Procedure

To minimize ﬂuctuations such as those due to laser-
power drifts or density ﬂuctuations of the atomic beam,
the rf voltage is frequency modulated at 10 kHz with
a peak-to-peak modulation depth of 20 kHz (modulation
index of 1). Since the rf-transition linewidth is ∼ 20 kHz,
this modulation provides a fast sweep across the absorp-
tion line shape. The ﬁrst- and second-harmonic outputs
from the lock-in ampliﬁer are shown on Fig. 4. The ﬁrst-
harmonic signal is an odd function of detuning while
the second-harmonic signal is an even function.
It is
well known that for small modulation amplitudes, the
output signal at the harmonics of the modulation fre-
quency are proportional to the corresponding derivatives
of the absorption line shape [21]. In our system, since the
modulation amplitude is comparable to the rf-transition
linewidth, the harmonic signals contain higher deriva-
tive contributions. Therefore, a ﬁtting function was de-
rived from ﬁrst-order time-dependent perturbation the-
ory. This model does not include any eﬀects due to power
broadening or beam velocity distribution and is used to
conﬁrm qualitative behavior of the line shape.

To measure the transition frequency, the ratio of the
ﬁrst- and second-harmonic signals is used in order to re-
duce drifts further. The transition frequency is extracted
from the ratio by a two-step process. In the ﬁrst step,
the ﬁrst- and second-harmonic lock-in amplitudes and
their ratio are recorded simultaneously [27] as the carrier
frequency is scanned 4 kHz around the resonance. For
such a small scan compared to the linewidth, the ﬁrst
harmonic is linear while the second harmonic is nearly
a constant (Fig. 4). By ﬁtting a linear function to the
ratio, a conversion parameter from the ratio to frequency
is obtained. Thus, these scans are called calibration ﬁles.
Once the calibration is established, as the second step,
the rf carrier frequency is locked at a ﬁxed value near
resonance (3,074,000 Hz and 234,661,000 Hz for the two
transitions), and the ratio is measured repeatedly. These
measurements are saved in the so-called ﬁxed-frequency
ﬁles. The average of ratios from these measurements are
converted to frequency using the calibration ﬁle.

It should be mentioned that before recording a calibra-
tion ﬁle, a speciﬁc phasing procedure is used to maximize

the lock-in-ampliﬁer signal at both harmonics. Since
Signal Recovery 7265 lock-in ampliﬁer allows for sepa-
rate phase adjustments for the two harmonics, the ﬁrst-
harmonic signal phase is adjusted to maximize the sig-
nal at 10 kHz above the ﬁxed-frequency value, while the
second-harmonic signal is maximized at the ﬁxed fre-
quency value. This procedure is used since the ﬁrst- and
second-harmonic signals are maximal near these frequen-
cies, respectively. In addition, to minimize any instability
or loss of signal due to laser detuning, each laser is re-
tuned between recording data ﬁles by scanning over the
laser resonances and setting the laser frequency to the
resonance peak. Using this technique for frequency mea-
surements, we have been able to achieve ∼ 2- and 6-Hz
statistical sensitivity for 1 second of integration time for
the 235- and 3.1-MHz transitions, respectively.

For collisional-perturbation measurements, foreign gas
is introduced into the chamber through a leak valve (Var-
ian Model 1000). In order to minimize contamination,
the hose connecting the gas cylinder to the leak valve
is evacuated with a separate pump and ﬂushed with gas
several times prior to opening the valve. Then, the leak
valve is opened and foreign gas is introduced continuously
until a dynamic equilibrium is reached at a manometer

rates are expected to be equal and opposite for the two tran-
sitions since there is a change in sign between the energy
diﬀerence of the levels involved. The O2 coeﬃcient was ex-
tracted using a measurement when air was let into the vacuum
chamber. This was only performed for the 235-MHz transi-
tion. The results have been corrected for the presence of the
background gases and the assigned errors include the eﬀects
of Dy self-shifts discussed in Sec. IV. As discussed at the end
of Sec. II C, the analysis does not include the estimated 5%
correction due to pressure calibration error.

which is indeed the case within the precision of the ex-
periment. For the gases that produce shifts, all but He,
shift a given transition in the same direction.

The analysis of the shift data is complicated by the
eﬀects of background gases. Since the normal operating
pressure of the vacuum chamber with the oven turned
on is ∼ 5 - 10 µTorr, the background gases, dominated
mostly by H2 and N2, and to a lesser extent by O2, make
up a signiﬁcant fraction of the overall pressure. More-
over, in some cases these gas pressures are not constant
throughout a measurement [28] and contribute to the ob-
served shift rates.

Since the capacitance manometer measures the total
gas pressure in the chamber, RGA partial gas pressures
are needed to establish the dominant-gas pressure and
correct for the systematic shifts induced by the back-
ground gases. However, RGA partial pressures must be
corrected with gas-species-dependent sensitivity factors
that are not well determined. We have tried to extract
these sensitivity factors using both data taken during
collisional-perturbation measurements, where the oven is
operating at ∼ 1500 K, and auxiliary cold-oven measure-
ments, where gas is introduced into the chamber with
the oven turned oﬀ.
In the latter case, the large H2
background is absent, and the operating pressure of the
vacuum chamber (without the foreign gas) is ∼ 1 µTorr,
dominated by N2. Therefore, the background gases can
be ignored and the sensitivity factors extracted using lin-
ear ﬁts to the manometer versus RGA data.

Extracting these parameters from the hot-oven data
relies on the fact that during measurements where H2 is
introduced into the chamber, the N2 and O2 pressures
are stable (we ignore all other gases including H2O since
their pressures are below 5 × 10−7 Torr throughout these

the transition frequency and the ﬁxed rf synthesizer carrier

data.

pressure reading of ∼ 80 µTorr. Meanwhile, the RGA is
monitored for contamination due to other residual gases
in the hose. After the background gas pressures drop
below 10 µTorr, measurements are taken at descending
pressures between 80 and 20 µTorr. At each pressure, one
calibration and three ﬁxed-frequency ﬁles are taken for
each transition. To check for systematic drifts and signal
loss, two more measurements at intermediate pressures
are taken after the lowest-pressure measurement.

Since foreign gas is introduced from the top of the
chamber while the chamber is continuously pumped from
the bottom, a pressure gradient between the top and the
interaction region might exist. Due to the large conduc-
tance of our chamber, we estimate a pressure gradient of
∼ 5%. Since the uncertainty in this pressure calibration
error is not well known, this correction is not included
in the results presented in Sec III and Sec. V in order to
preserve the relative precision of the measurements.

III. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

A. Frequency shifts

For all the gases except H2 and Ne, which do not shift
the transition frequency, ∼ 100 Hz shifts were observed
over the 10 to 80 µTorr pressure range. Since these tran-
sitions are between two excited states, the measured shift
rates are due to the diﬀerence between the shift of the
levels involved in the transition. As shown in Fig. 5,
the shifts for the two rf transitions are in opposite direc-
tions. This is expected since for the 235-MHz transition,
level B is lower in energy than level A, while for the 3.1-
MHz transition, the opposite is the case. Moreover, since
electronic structures of the isotopes are identical, the ab-
solute value of the shift coeﬃcients should be identical,

For the 3.1-MHz transition, the O2 shift rate for the 235-
MHz transition with the opposite sign was used. The
results are presented in Table I.

measurements). Using this fact, the H2 sensitivity fac-
tor, βH2, was extracted in the same way as the auxil-
iary cold-oven method, ignoring the other gases. The
N2 sensitivity factor, βN 2, was extracted from measure-
ments where N2 was introduced into the chamber, but
by accounting for the background H2 pressure (using the
extracted βH2). Finally, the O2 sensitivity factor, βO2,
was extracted taking both the N2 and H2 pressures into
account using data where air was introduced into the
chamber.

The RGA sensitivity factors extracted using the cold-
oven and hot-oven data disagree at ∼ 10 - 20 % level, sug-
gesting that they are also dependent on the background-
gas pressures. As a result, in the rest of the analysis,
sensitivity factors extracted from in-situ hot-oven mea-
surements were used with larger error bars to accommo-
date for the results obtained by the auxiliary cold-oven
measurements. In addition, in order to minimize the un-
certainty introduced by the use of RGA sensitivity fac-
tors, the dominant gas pressures, Pgas, were calculated
using

where P (CM ) is the manometer pressure, Pi(RGA) and
βi are the RGA partial pressure and sensitivity factor
of a background gas species i, respectively. Since the
background-gas pressures are at least two times smaller
than the dominant-gas pressure, by using this method,
the uncertainty due to the sensitivity factors are reduced
to levels comparable to or smaller than the manometer
uncertainty of 1 µTorr.

Once the sensitivity factors of the background gases
were determined, an iterative approach was used to ex-
tract the Dy rf-transition-shift rates for H2, N2, and O2.
The iterative approach is necessary for these gases be-
cause for a measurement where one of these gases domi-
nates, the other two are background gases. As a result,
to extract the correct shift rate for one of them requires
the knowledge of the shift rates of the other two, which,
in turn, are dependent on the shift rate that is being ex-
tracted. So, on the ﬁrst iteration, the H2 shift rate was
extracted by taking into account the background N2 and
O2 pressures but not the shifts due to them. Then, the N2
shift rate was extracted similarly, by taking into account
both the H2 and O2 pressures, as well as shifts due to H2.
Finally, the O2 shift rate was extracted by taking into ac-
count both N2 and H2 pressures and shifts (only for the
235-MHz transition since no air data were taken for the
3.1-MHz transition). Then, these ﬁrst-order coeﬃcients
were used to extract higher-order coeﬃcients where pres-
sures and shifts due to all the background gases were used
in every step. This iterative process converged within
three iterations, improving χ2 at every step.

The rest of the gases were easier to analyze since they
do not appear as background gases in other measure-
ments. The coeﬃcients for these gases were determined
by taking into account the background H2, N2 and O2.

axis, the inverse of the normalized ﬁrst harmonic slope, which
is directly proportional to the linewidth is plotted. The solid
line is the least-squares linear ﬁt to the data.

B. Broadening

Since the main focus of this study is frequency shifts,
the experimental technique we utilize is optimized for
frequency measurements. Nevertheless, the broadening
rates can also be extracted from the calibration ﬁles.
However, determination of the broadening rates is more
diﬃcult than the shift rates since, as discussed below,
the sensitivity of the calibration data to linewidth is low.
In addition, there is a systematic eﬀect caused by the
phasing procedure used (see Sec. II C) coupled with the
collisional shift of the resonance frequency that results
in an enhancement of apparent broadening rates for one
transition and reduction for the other.

The slope of the ﬁrst-harmonic signal near resonance,
normalized by the second harmonic can be extracted by
ﬁtting a linear function to the ratio from the calibration
ﬁle data, as described in Sec. II C. For small modula-
tion amplitudes, the ﬁrst-harmonic signal is proportional
to the ﬁrst derivative of the absorption line shape and
the second harmonic to the second derivative. Near reso-
nance, to ﬁrst order in frequency detuning, both of these
functions have a 1/γ3 dependence. As a result, the slope
of the ratio is insensitive to the linewidth. However, since
for our system the harmonics contain higher-order deriva-
tives, this slope has a small dependence on the linewidth
and decreases as the linewidth increases due to gas pres-
sure. In practice, the inverse of this slope, which is di-
rectly proportional to the linewidth [29], is the useful
quantity in converting the ratio to frequency (Fig. 6).

The conversion factor from the inverse slope to

tainties are due to statistical noise and the uncertainty in the
conversion factor from the inverse slope to linewidth. The O2

linewidth is extracted from measurements where calibra-
tion ﬁles and line-shape scans were taken simultaneously
for diﬀerent rf input powers, which lead to power broad-
ening. The extracted conversion factor of 31(5) agrees
with the conversion factor of 28.2 obtained from the ﬁrst-
order perturbation theory calculation by linearizing the
ratio near resonance. In the analysis of the data, the ex-
perimental value is used and errors propagated accord-
ingly.

There is a systematic eﬀect related to the phasing
procedure which is due to the dependence of the ﬁrst-
harmonic slope near resonance, and hence the slope of
the ratio, on the frequency at which the phase is adjusted
to maximize the signal (which we deﬁne as phasing fre-
quency). For small changes in the phasing frequency, the
experimental measurements show a linear dependence
with 0.025(3) and 0.029(5) Hz change in the inverse slope
per Hz change in the phasing frequency for the 235- and
3.1-MHz transitions, respectively. For all the gases where
shifts are observed, with the exception of He, which shifts
the transition frequency in the opposite direction, this
eﬀect leads to an enhancement of the broadening rates
for the 235-MHz transition and a reduction for the 3.1-
MHz transition. This is due to the fact that as the gas
pressure is changed, the transition frequency shifts but
the phasing frequency is ﬁxed at 10 kHz above the carrier
frequency used for the ﬁxed-frequency measurements. As
a result, the phasing frequency changes with respect to
the transition frequency. For example, from the Kr shift
data shown in Fig. 5, at low pressures, the rf carrier fre-
quency for the 235-MHz transition is 50 Hz below the
transition frequency, while at high pressures, it is 100 Hz
above the transition frequency (the y axis of the ﬁgure is
transition frequency minus carrier frequency). As a re-
sult, while at low pressures, the phasing frequency with
respect to the transition frequency is less than 10 kHz,
at high pressures, it is greater than 10 kHz. This leads
to an enhancement of apparent broadening since at low
pressures the observed inverse slope is less than the value

MHz transition due to Xe . The signal has been normalized

that would be observed without this eﬀect, and the oppo-
site is the case at high pressures. The 3.1-MHz transition
is shifted in the opposite direction, and as a result, the
observed broadening is reduced for this transition. This
is a signiﬁcant eﬀect since the changes in the transition
frequency lead to 3 - 4 Hz changes in the inverse slope. In
comparison, as seen in Fig. 6, the changes in the inverse
slope due to the gases are 10 - 15 Hz.

The results that have been corrected for this systematic
eﬀect, as well as the systematic eﬀect due to the presence
of the background gases, are presented in Table II. Even
with this correction, the statistical noise coupled with
the uncertainty in the conversion from inverse slope to
linewidth lead to poor ﬁts for the 3.1-MHz data. Conse-
quently, the broadening results for this transition are not
presented. For the same reasons, only an upper bound
for the 235-MHz O2 broadening rate is presented. Due to
small O2 pressure variation (≤ 1.1 µTorr), the omission
of the O2 correction is not problematic in this case since
even if the broadening rate for O2 were 8.6 Hz/µTorr
(the upper 2σ bound from Table II), this would lead to
an error of . 5% for the measurements that exhibit the
largest O2 pressure variation.

C. Signal Attenuation

During the ﬁxed-frequency measurements, ∼ 15 - 40 %
decrease in the second-harmonic-signal amplitude, which
is nonzero at resonance, as a function of foreign-gas pres-
sure was observed (Fig. 7). This signal attenuation can
be attributed to either decrease in the beam density due
to elastic scattering or decrease in the ﬂuorescence in-
tensity due to inelastic quenching. The signal amplitude
decreases with the distance the beam travels through the
foreign gas:

<S(v)>= GI0 <e−l/λ(v)>,

uncertainty due to pressure gradients in the chamber. For the combined cross sections, gas temperature of 300(5) K and Dy
beam temperature of 1500(50) K are assumed.

to pressure, the signal for small pressure changes can be

(3)

where S0 is the second-harmonic signal at zero pressure,
and ǫ is the attenuation rate.

The analysis of the quenching data is similar to the
analysis of the shift and broadening. First, the iterative
process was used for the dominant gases in the back-
ground, H2, N2, and O2. Then, the values extracted
were used in the analysis of the remaining gases. The at-
tenuation rates tabulated in Table III include systematic
corrections due to clogging of the unheated photon colli-
mator (Fig. 3) and temperature drift of the ovens. To de-
tect any changes in the signal amplitude due to clogging,
the two measurements at intermediate pressures taken
after the lowest pressure points, as discussed in Sec. II C,
were used. The oven temperature was monitored by a
thermocouple and changes in the beam density due to
temperature ﬂuctuations were estimated using Dy sat-
urated vapor-pressure dependence on temperature (see
Sec. IV.)

The interpretation of the signal attenuation data is
complicated since it is diﬃcult to separate elastic scat-
tering events that decrease beam density from inelastic
quenching that decreases the population of level B. Nev-
ertheless, we expect the elastic scattering contribution to
be small since although typical elastic cross sections are
∼ 10−14 cm2 (corresponding to a mean free path of ∼ 30
cm at 100 µTorr), large angle scattering necessary for sig-
niﬁcant collimation loss is suppressed by more than one
order of magnitude due to the fact that diﬀerential cross
section is sharply peaked at small scattering angles [22].
Using the results derived in Ref. [23] for hard-ball scatter-
ing, we have estimated that the diﬀerential cross section

becomes appreciable below 0.1 - 0.01 radian in the center-
of-mass frame. For a head-on collision, this results in 6
- 7 mrad deviation for the Dy beam in the laboratory
frame. This deviation is small compared to the collima-
tion half angle of 0.1 radian used in our experiment. How-
ever, since this estimate uses a hard-ball model, which
depends on few assumptions such as a speciﬁc minimum
distance between the centers of the spheres, as opposed
to more complicated interactions such as quasi-molecular
formation, it can vary by a multiplicative factor of 2 - 5.
As a result, we only present upper bounds for the inelas-
tic quenching cross sections.

The attenuation rates can be related to the quenching
cross sections through a characteristic mean free path,
which can be expressed as

λ =

where <vB>= 3/4(2π k TB/mB)1/2 is the average beam
velocity given by a modiﬁed Maxwellian distribution, nG
is the density of foreign gas, v is the relative velocity
of the gas and beam particles, and < σqv > denotes an
average over both the gas and the beam velocity distri-
butions.

Using Eq. (4) and Eq. (3), the quantity <σqv> can be

written in terms of ǫ as

(5)

where TG and T are the temperatures of the foreign gas
and the oven, respectively. The path length, l, is not well
deﬁned in our experimental setup. Since the light pipe
has a width of 6.7 cm, it collects ﬂuorescence from atoms
at various path lengths. The tabulated results assume a
path length of 5.5 cm, which is the distance between the
laser excitation region and the center of the light pipe.
The results are summarized in Table III.

1.5) ×1014 cm−3 in the oven. Earlier absorption mea-
surements [19] have shown that the density of atoms in
the population and detection region is ∼ 5 × 109 cm−3
at the normal operating temperature of 1170◦C. This
density is in agreement with estimates based on eﬀusive
ﬂow. To obtain the Dy density in the interaction re-
gion for various temperatures, the scaling factor between
the calculated density in the oven at 1170◦C and the ab-
sorption measurements was applied uniformly to all the
calculated densities. The extracted self-shift rates were
0.2(2.0) × 10−10 Hz cm3 and -3.1(6.0) × 10−10 Hz cm3
for the 235-MHz and 3.1-MHz transitions, respectively
(Fig. 8). An upper bound for the magnitude of the self-
shift rate can be estimated by noting that the rates, m,
for these two transitions should be the same in magnitude
but opposite in sign:

|m| =

|m235 − m3.1|,

(7)

1
2

0 = |m235 + m3.1|,

where the second equation provides a way to estimate
errors. The resulting upper bound on the magnitude of
the self-shift rate is < 4.9 × 10−10 Hz cm3 at 1σ conﬁ-
dence level. Since changing the oven temperature does
not discriminate between Dy* and Dy densities, this up-
per bound is an eﬀective rate due to both Dy*-Dy* and
Dy*-Dy collisions. A simple way to address this ambigu-
ity would be to change the laser powers simultaneously
to change the fraction of excited Dy atoms. This method
may be pursued in a future study.

Using the extracted upper bound, we can estimate the
systematic contribution of self-collisions to the measured
shift and broadening rates. This requires a mechanism
that changes Dy beam density as a function of foreign-gas
pressure. As a worst-case scenario, we assume that all of
the observed signal attenuation is due to the decrease in
the Dy density as a result of scattering with the foreign-
gas atoms. Depending on the gas, this results in a change
of ∼ (0.9 − 2.2) × 109 cm−3 in the Dy density, which
corresponds to ∼ 0.4−1.1 Hz change in the magnitude of
the transition frequency from low to high has pressures.
The correction to the foreign-gas shift rates are in the
range of 0.005 - 0.01 Hz/µTorr. These uncertainties have
been included in Table I.

Since, in general, broadening should be of the same
order of magnitude as shifts, the uncertainty due to self-
broadening is negligible compared to the errors quoted
on Table II.

V. DISCUSSION

The adiabatic impact approximation results give a
Lorentzian line shape with the transition frequency and

FIG. 8: Shifts due to collision of the Dy atoms in the beam.
Beam density was varied by changing the oven temperature
from 1170◦C to 1077◦C which correspond to the estimated
atomic densities in the interaction region shown in the plots.

IV. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES

In addition to systematic eﬀects considered above,
Dy*(excited Dy atoms)-Dy* and Dy*-Dy collisions
within the beam can lead to a systematic change in the
transition frequency and linewidth, if the beam density
does not remain constant during the collisional measure-
ments. We have performed independent measurements of
self-collisions in our system and present here an estimate
of their contribution to the systematic uncertainty.

The beam density can be controlled by varying the
oven temperature. The temperature dependence of Dy
saturated-vapor pressure is given by the following empir-
ical formula [24]:

P = 1012.460−15336/T −1.114 log(T ),

(6)

where P is the pressure in Torr and T is the temperature
in Kelvin.

We have varied the oven temperature, which was mon-
itored by a thermocouple, from 1077◦C to 1170◦C, while
monitoring the frequency for both transitions. This tem-
perature range corresponds to a Dy density of (0.3 −

As illustrated by this example, σs/2σb has a value of
0.364, independent of C′
6. In fact, within the adiabatic
impact approximation, a unique ratio is predicted for
each interaction potential which can be used to deter-
mine the dominant form of the interaction. Since cross
sections can have a dependence on the relative velocities,
the quantities <σv> for both broadening and shifts ex-
tracted from our experimental results are tabulated in
Table IV, as well as their ratio. The sign convention for
the shift cross sections has been chosen such that a pos-
itive frequency shift for the 3.1-MHz transition (where
level B has higher energy than level A) gives a positive

cross section. The measured ratios vary widely for diﬀer-
ent gases. In foreign gas perturbations, this is a common
situation since in addition to long range attractive inter-
actions, short range repulsive forces can be important.
This is especially true for H2, He and Ne which do not
interact strongly via the van der Waals interaction [26].
Our results are in agreement with this trend: H2 and
Ne cause no shifts, while He induces an opposite shift
as a result of dominant repulsive forces. On the other
hand, all three gases show broadening comparable to the
other gases. This can be understood by observing the
integrands of Eqs. (10). While the integrand for the shift
cross section oscillates around zero, the integrand for the
width cross section is always positive, yielding a nonzero
broadening even for short-range interactions.

VI.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE α-VARIATION

EXPERIMENT

Collisional shifts are one of the most important sys-
tematics for an experiment searching for the temporal
variation of α using Dy since they mimic frequency shifts
that would be induced by variation in α. The α depen-
dence of diﬀerent isotopes and hyperﬁne-level manifolds
of odd isotpes are the same [31]. As a result, the en-
tire manifold of level B shifts identically with respect to
the manifold of level A. Monitoring diﬀerent transitions
where energy of level A is larger than the energy of B,
and vice versa provides a powerful tool in detecting and
eliminating certain systematics since the shift induced
by α variation should have the same magnitude but op-
posite sign for these transitions. However, as seen in
Table I, this behavior is identical to that of the shifts
induced by collisions, and therefore, gas pressures must
be kept stable to 1 part in 104 for a background pressure
of ∼ 1 µTorr, or lowered to . 3 × 10−10 Torr to achieve
the desired mHz-level stability over a year.

This conclusion is in agreement with the estimates pro-
vided in Ref. [11]. However, it was also argued in Ref. [11]
that a suppression of collisional shifts might exist due to
the fact that the transitions are nominally between f and
d inner-shell electrons and that inelastic quenching might

11

remove atoms experiencing collisions from levels A or B
so that they would not contribute to the signal. Our
present results do not reveal such suppression of colli-
sional shifts.

With the current experimental setup, the operating
pressure is ∼ 5 µTorr, mostly dominated by hydrogen
and nitrogen. A new vacuum chamber that can achieve
10−10 Torr with a Dy oven operating at 1500 K is under
construction. In the mean time, data that is being ac-
quired with the current chamber will be corrected using
the measured collisional shift coeﬃcients to achieve an es-
timated stability of 2 Hz over a year, which corresponds
to sensitivity of | ˙α/α| ∼ 10−15/yr. This sensitivity is
comparable to the best current laboratory limits [13, 15].

of the signal amplitude. A frequency-modulation tech-
nique used for the search of the temporal variation of
the ﬁne-structure constant was utilized to measure the
small perturbations induced at such low pressures. The
extracted cross sections are similar to cross sections for
optical transitions [8].

To improve our understanding of the interaction po-
tentials, several avenues may be pursued in the future.
As seen in Eqs. (11), the possible velocity dependence of
cross sections can be exploited by varying the gas tem-
perature. Moreover, a careful study of the line shape far
oﬀ resonance would be informative due to strong temper-
ature dependences and satellite-line formations at higher
pressures [26].

that must be used to convert inverse slopes to linewidths.
However, this y-intercept is irrelevant for the extraction

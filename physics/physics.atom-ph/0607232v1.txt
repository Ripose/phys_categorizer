The Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) method using a large Laguerre basis restricted to ℓ = 0 orbitals
is applied to the calculation of the He ground state. The maximum number of orbitals included was
60. The numerical evidence suggests that the energy converges as ∆EN ≈ A/N 7/2 + B/N 8/2 + . . .
where N is the number of Laguerre basis functions. The electron-electron δ-function expectation
converges as ∆δN ≈ A/N 5/2 + B/N 6/2 + . . . and the variational limit for the ℓ = 0 basis is estimated
as 0.1557637174(2) a3

In eﬀect, it may be best to choose a non-optimal exponent if one wishes to extrapolate to the
variational limit. An investigation of the Natural Orbital asymptotics revealed the energy converged
as ∆EN ≈ A/N 6 + B/N 7 + . . . while the electron-electron δ-function expectation converged as
∆δN ≈ A/N 4 + B/N 5 + . . .. The asymptotics of expectation values other than the energy showed
ﬂuctuations that depended on whether N was even or odd.

INTRODUCTION

where explicit expressions for AE and BE exist, namely

There have been a number of studies of the conver-
gence of the conﬁguration interaction (CI) expansion of
the helium ground state [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] following
the pioneering work of Schwartz [9]. These studies have
investigated the convergence of the energy with respect
to the number of partial waves included in the wave func-
tion and also with respect to the dimension of the radial
basis.

It has been known since 1962 [9] that the energy con-
verges slowly with respect to J, the maximum angular
momentum of any orbital included in the CI expansion.
In particular the leading term to the energy increment is
known to behave as

No expressions for CE exist. The numerical values in
eqs. (3) and (4) are obtained from close to exact wave
functions [2].

However, the convergence with respect to J represents
only one aspect of the convergence problem. Just as im-
portant is the convergence with respect to the dimension
of the radial basis N , for a given J. How do the incre-

behave? In eﬀect, what are the values of p and t? This
aspect of the CI expansion is not as well understood as
the convergence with J and there have been no studies
equivalent in sophistication to those of Schwartz [9], Hill
[2] and Kutzelnigg and collaborators [3, 6]. Some at-
tention has been given to the radial convergence of the
hydrogen atom in gaussian basis sets [10]. The seminal
investigation of Carroll and collaborators concluded that

mately motivating the use of principal quantum number
expansions to extrapolate energies to the inﬁnite basis
limit from correlation consistent basis sets [12]. More re-
cently, Goldman performed a regression analysis to give

a common exponent [13].

The radial basis sets used for the conﬁguration inter-
action or many body perturbation theory treatments of
atomic structure can be broadly divided into two classes.
In the ﬁrst class, one deﬁnes a box and a piece-wise poly-
nomial (e.g a spline) is used to deﬁne the radial depen-
dence of the wave function in the interior of the box. The
properties of the radial basis are determined by the size
of the box, the number of knot points, and where they are
located. The other approach typically expands the wave
function in terms of a basis of functions with a convenient
analytic form, examples would be an evenly tempered set
of Slater type orbitals (STOs) [3, 7] (this type of basis
set is often optimized with respect to a couple of param-
eters used to deﬁned a sequence of exponents) or a set of
Laguerre type orbitals (LTOs) [14, 15, 16].

The two most recent examples of these two approaches
are the calculations by Decleva et al (B-splines) [4] and
Sims and Hagstrom (Slater basis) [7] which are the
biggest calculations of their respective type. The B-spline
calculation has given estimates ∆EJ increments that are

believed to be accurate to within 10−
One of the reasons this accuracy is possible is that ∆EJ
varies smoothly as the number of knot points is adjusted.
This made it possible to obtain reasonable estimates of
the inﬁnite basis limit. Their estimate of the s-wave limit

was accurate to better than 10−
extreme level of accuracy was not possible when using
the Slater basis [7] since linear dependence issues made it
problematic to expand their radial basis to completeness.
Indeed, resorting to REAL*24 arithmetic still resulted in
an error of 4

6 hartree.

In some investigations of the convergence properties
of the CI expansion for the helium atom [8] and mixed
electron-positron systems [17] it became apparent that a
better understanding of the issues that inﬂuence the con-
vergence of the radial basis was desirable. For example,
it was apparent that the dimension of the radial basis
should be increased as J increases in order to ensure the
successive ∆EJ increments are computed to the same
relative accuracy [8, 17, 18]. In addition, it was readily
apparent that extrapolation of the radial LTO basis to
limit was not straightforward.

In this work, we investigate the radial convergence of
the CI expansion for a more manageable model of the
helium atom with the orbitals restricted to the ℓ = 0
partial wave. The linear dependence issues that are such
a problem for a Slater basis are eliminated by choosing
the radial basis to consist of LTOs [15, 19], (formally, the
LTO basis spans the same space as the common exponent
Slater basis, i.e. rni exp(
λr)). We note in passing the
previous work of Holøein [16] who also investigated the

convergence of a (small) LTO basis for an s-wave model
of helium. Initially, we examine the merits of using an
LTO basis with the exponent optimized to the basis di-
mension. The nature of the asymptotic expansion for the
energy increments is then deduced. Finally, the density
matrix for our best wave function is diagonalized and the
convergence properties of the natural orbital expansion
are also determined. As part of this analysis, attention
is also given to the convergence of the electron-electron
coalescence matrix element since it arises in calculations
of the two-electron relativistic Darwin correction [20] and
electron-positron annihilation [21].

parameters, N , the number of LTOs, and λ the exponent
characterizing the range of the LTOs. It is normal to use
a common exponent, λ and when this is done the basis
functions form an orthogonal set. The exponent can be
optimized to give the lowest energy and when this is done
one can deﬁne λM to be the value of optimal λ for a basis
of dimension M . The value of λM was seen to increase

Calculations for basis sets with λM optimized for di-
mensions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 have been per-
formed. The optimal exponents are listed in Table I along
with the energy for those values of M . The calculations
were expedited by using the result that the two-electron
Slater integrals for any λ are related to each other by
a very simple scaling relation. Accordingly, the list of
Slater integrals could be generated once (by numerical

A. Use of quadruple precision arithmetic

The present calculations were all performed with
quadruple precision arithmetic. It was only possible to
get energies precise to 13 signiﬁcant digits for the largest
calculations when double precision arithmetic was used.
This was caused by roundoﬀ error gradually accumulat-
ing during the course of the rather extensive calculations
and the 13 digits appears to be the limit that can be
achieved for double precision arithmetic (some experi-
mentation revealed that the last 2 digits of the 15 double
precision digits were sensitive to diﬀerent Fortran com-
pilers and even the optimization options of those com-
pilers). The analysis requires investigation of the energy
diﬀerences of eq. (5), and these energy diﬀerences can
be rather small (e.g. ∆E60 = 1.5
10 hartree for
the λ60 basis). The ﬂuctuations caused by roundoﬀ did
have a noticeable impact on the parameters derived from
these energy diﬀerences at large N . These ﬂuctuations
were removed once quadruple precision arithmetic was
adopted.

of curves show that pE tends to peak at values larger than
10 at an intermediate N and then shows a tendency to
3.7 for the most
decrease. The value at N = 60 was pE ≈
of the curves shown in ﬁgure 1.

The salient point to be extracted from Figure 1 is that
the value of pE for a given λM at N = M is quite dif-
ferent from the asymptotic value, e.g. the value of pE
for the λ20 curve is much larger at N = 20 than it is

at N = 60. This is quite an annoying result.
one would like to perform the largest calculation with
the exponent optimized for that dimension basis. Then
the speciﬁc form of the power law decay would be esti-
mated by analyzing the energies obtained from a series
of slightly smaller calculations. This information would
subsequently be used to estimate the energy or other ex-
pectation value in the variational limit. However, this
is not possible since the energy increments will not have
achieved their asymptotic form.

Although there are problems in using an optimized ex-
ponent, it may still be possible to analyze a sequence of
energies from a calculation with a non-optimized expo-
nent and thereby estimate the variational limit. Assum-
ing that the increments obey eq. (13), one can write

remainder and hence deduce the variational limit. The
variational limits in Table I were extracted from the cal-
culations with N = 60. The exact variational limit can
be predicted to the 9th digit after the decimal point. The
most inaccurate estimate of the variational limit is that
from the λ60 calculation. So the calculation that is ex-
plicitly optimized at N = 60, (i.e. with λ60), and gives
the best energy at N = 60, gives the worst estimate of
the variational limit!

A CI calculation of the Li+ ground state restricted
to the ℓ = 0 partial wave was also performed to check
whether the conclusions above were peculiar to He. Once
again, the exponent pE was approximately 3.7 at N = 60
and the convergence pattern for N < M was distorted
by optimization of the exponent.

IV. THE δ-FUNCTION EXPECTATION VALUE

(15)

(16)

Part of the motivation for the present study is to gain
a better understanding of how to perform CI calcula-
tions for mixed electron-positron systems. Apart from
the energy, the next most important expectation value
for a positronic system is the electron-positron annihila-
tion rate [21]. The annihilation rate is proportional to
the expectation of the electron-positron delta function,
and has the inconvenient property that it is even more
slowly convergent than the energy [15, 26]. Accordingly,
the convergence of the electron-electron δ-function is in-
vestigated using the methodology previously used for the

Although distortions in the convergence pattern are

the successive ∆δN increments are larger. As a rule, pδ
was at least 10% larger than 2.6 at N = M . A choice

The purely visual evidence that the lowest order term of

pE is O(N −

subjected to extensive testing.

More substantial evidence is provided by a ﬁt of the p

What we have done is ﬁt (Np + 1) successive pE or pδ
values to eq. (17) for the λ10 data sequence. The results
of those ﬁts are given in Table II.

Using a 4 or 5 term ﬁts (and 6 term ﬁt in the case
of pE) results in limiting exponents very close to either
3.5 (for pE) or 2.5 (for pδ). These estimates were also
reasonably stable. For example, the value of pE for a
5-term ﬁt for a data sequence terminating at N = 50 (as
opposed to N = 60 in Table II) was 3.4970.

The more sophisticated extrapolations shown in Figure

a very large calculation of the ground state wave function
with a basis of 70 LTOs (λ = 11.10) was performed. The
one electron density matrix was then diagonalized and
the resulting natural orbitals were used to deﬁne a new
orbital basis ordered in terms of decreasing ground state

The calculations were taken up to a maximum NO ex-
pansion length of 20. The LTO basis of dimension 70 was
not large enough to give a precise representation of the
NOs beyond that point. The energies in the table are
expected to be accurate estimates of the “exact” NO en-
ergy for all digits with the possible exception of the last
two. The energies in Table III are slightly lower than
the previous tabulations of the s-wave NO energies by
Carroll et al [1] and Goldman [13]. We treat the NO
orbitals merely as a particularly optimal set of orbitals
to input into a CI calculations. So unlike Carroll et al
and Goldman the conﬁguration space is not restricted to
only include φi(r1)φi(r2) type conﬁgurations. It should
be noted that we have also done some calculations us-
ing the pure NO conﬁguration space and when this is
done the energies agree with those of Carroll et al and
N values in Table III are

Figure 9 shows the variation of pE and pδ versus 1/N
for a sequence of increasingly larger NO calculations up
to N = 20. The visual inspection of the pX vs 1/N
curve immediately suggests that pE = 6 + A/N + . . . and
pδ = 4 + A/N + . . .. The supposition has been conﬁrmed
by doing ﬁts to the asymptotic form

values of 5.992, 5.997 and 5.996 (the 5-term series which
gave p0 = 5.967 is likely to be more susceptible to small
imperfections in the NOs). A least-squares ﬁt to the
function pE = p0 + p1/N t over the N
[11, 20] interval
gave p0 = 6.0005 and t = 1.070. A least-squares ﬁt to the
function pδ = p0 + p1/N t over the N
[11, 20] interval
gave p0 = 3.992 and t = 0.9174. A small even-odd ripple
was present in the pδ vs N graph.

plicated calculation, and so it is more likely to be af-

The coeﬃcient of the leading order term for ∆E was
-0.2999 hartree which is a bit larger in magnitude than
the value initially given by Carroll et al [1], namely -
0.24 hartree. This level of agreement is acceptable given
the fact that Carroll et al actually use a slightly diﬀer-
6 functional form (and do not allow
ent AE/(N
for higher order terms) and extract the value of AE at
10 which is too low to extract the asymptotic value
N
of AE (the value of AE varies by more than 10% be-
tween N = 10 and N = 20 for a single-term asymptotic
formula). The precision of the Carroll et al calculation
is also less than that of the present calculation (they ob-
tained -2.879028765 hartree as their variational limit).

quantum number of the natural orbital. When analyz-
ing this set of data it was discovered that there were
regular ﬂuctuations in the derived parameters as a func-
tion of N as the analysis was made more sophisticated.
When the 3-term approximation to eq. (17) was used
the value of p0 oscillated between 3.94 and 4.06 depend-
ing on whether N was even or odd (the oscillations in
p1 were more marked). The oscillations became larger
for the 4-term ﬁt, here it was found that the p0 typ-
ically ﬂipped between 3.4 and 4.6. The actual values
given in Table II were obtained by weighted average, e.g.
p0 = 0.25p0(N = 19) + 0.50p0(N = 20) + 0.25p0(N = 21).
These oscillations are most likely due to the physical
properties of the basis set expansion of the He ground
state. It has been known for a long time that treating
the two electrons as an inner and outer electron can lead
to a better description of the radial correlations [7, 27].
With the electrons having a tendency to separate into
inner and outer radial orbitals the possibility does exist
that achieving this separation might be slightly easier or
harder if there are an even or odd number of NOs. It must
be recalled that NOs themselves are objects that depend
on the electron dynamics. The convergence of the mean
electron-nucleus distance, i.e.
was also examined and
the convergence pattern was quite irregular. Deﬁning pr
using eq. (14) results in the strongly oscillating plot of
pr vs 1/N observed in Figure 9. The oscillations disap-

tions in pE and pδ for even and odd values of N . Oscil-
lations in pδ were previously seen for the NO sequence
but the pδ oscillations in Figure 10 are more pronounced
than those in Figure 9. Some of the values in Table II
were given using the 3-point averaging used previously
for the Natural Orbital sequence.

series should be regarded as conjecture supported by nu-
merical evidence. More deﬁnite proof would require the
calculations to be extended to N > 100. The common
exponent of the LTO basis should not be chosen to op-
timize the energy for the largest calculation since this
results in a distorted convergence pattern. In eﬀect, op-
timizing the LTO exponent for N LTOs, and then using
the (N
1) and N energies to determine the
coeﬃcients of a 3-term expansion to eq. (18) will give an
inaccurate estimate of the energy correction needed to
achieve the variational limit. Any extrapolation would
seem to require that N (the number of LTOs) should ex-
ceed M (the basis dimension at which λ was optimized)
by about ten or more. This conclusion holds for both the
energy and electron-electron δ-function. The very slow

convergence of the inter-electronic δ-function. Examina-

in pr. The presence of these ripples could complicate de-
termination of the variational limit of expectation values

The convergence rate of the optimized LTO basis was

degree of uncertainty in both of these exponents is much
larger than for the ﬁxed λ LTO sequence or the NO
sequence. The extremely tedious nature of the λ op-

timization, combined with the lack of knowledge about
the nature of the asymptotic series beyond the ﬁrst two
terms, make this extrapolation a less attractive proposi-
tion. The noticeable even-odd oscillation in pδ and even
pE further render the method even more unattractive.
The implications of this behavior are not conﬁned to the
present work. For example, it is likely that correlated

λ is often energy optimized as the basis dimension is in-

One of the main motivations for the present study
was to gain insight into solving the problems associ-
ated with the very slow convergence of CI calculations
for mixed electron-positron systems [15, 17, 23, 33]. In
eﬀect, the problem is to determine the complete basis
set limit [12, 34, 35] for these exotic systems. The slow
7/2) convergence of the energy for an LTO basis
O(N −
set is greatly improved by the adoption of extrapolation
schemes. Using the N = 10 energy for the λ10 basis and
the best extrapolation of the N = 60 calculation in Table
II as two reference points, one deduces an eﬀective con-
10). The penalty associated with
vergence rate of O(N −
the use of the extrapolation formulae is the necessity to
use quadruple precision arithmetic if 3 or more terms are
retained in the inverse power series (note, a 3-term se-
ries for ∆δN was numerically stable in double precision
arithmetic). The need to use the quadruple precision
arithmetic is caused by the very small size of the ∆EN
increments and the impact of round-oﬀ error on the ﬁt to
the inverse power series. One somewhat ironic feature is
that it is necessary to use a basis that is not energy op-
timized so that the extrapolation to the variational limit
can be done reliably.

this leads to a corresponding series, eq. (A7) that also

eq. (A1).

APPENDIX B: SCALING OF THE 2-ELECTRON
INTEGRALS

The most time-consuming part of the calculation was
the generation of the electron-electron and annihilation

matrix elements. However, the expense of this was
greatly reduced by generating an initial set of integrals
for a given λ, and then using a scaling factor to generate
the integral lists for other values of λ.

The basic integral that has to be done is

R(na, nb, nc, nd, λ) =

dr1 dr2 Na(λ)Nb(λ)

Z Z
Nc(λ)Nd(λ)fa(λr1)fb(λr2)
V (r1, r2)fc(λr1)fd(λr2)

Dielectronic recombination has been investigated for ∆n =
1 resonances of ground-state Li+(1s2) and for ∆n = 0 reso-
nances of metastable Li+(1s2s 3S). The ground-state spec-
trum shows three prominent transitions between 53 and
64 eV, while the metastable spectrum exhibits many transi-
tions with energies < 3.2 eV. Reasonably good agreement of
R-matrix, LS coupling calculations with the measured recom-
bination rate coeﬃcient is obtained. The time dependence of
the recombination rate yields a radiative lifetime of 52.2 ± 5.0
s for the 2 3S level of Li+.

In collisions between ions and electrons, recombination
[1] can occur either by radiative recombination (RR) (in-
verse of the photoelectric eﬀect), or by dielectronic re-
combination (DR). This process starts by the resonant
capture of a free electron, mediated by its interaction
with a bound electron (inverse of an Auger transition),
and then proceeds by a radiative transition to a stable
recombined system. Dielectronic recombination is of fun-
damental interest because it gives insight into electron
correlation, and of applied interest for the understanding
of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Extensive ex-
perimental studies providing signiﬁcant tests of the the-
ory [1] have been conducted for H-like, He-like, and Li-
like ions heavier than about carbon. For such systems,
perturbative techniques can be successfully used in theo-
retical calculations because the electron–electron interac-
tion is relatively weak compared to the electron–nucleus
interaction.
In contrast, for lighter ions perturbative
techniques cease to produce results at the same level of
accuracy. Hence, high quality data for light systems are
required to test the reliability of theoretical predictions.
For the lightest H-like ion, He+, DR was studied pre-
viously by three groups [2–4] with successively higher
energy resolution, and through a consequent feedback
between experiment and theory good mutual agreement
could be obtained. For the lightest He-like ion, Li+, the
two-electron conﬁguration places additional constraints
on the theory of RR and DR. Moreover, the existence
of relatively long-lived metastable 1s2s 1S and 1s2s 3S
states with natural lifetimes of about 0.5 ms and 50 s,
respectively, requires recombination for both the ground
state and the metastable state (especially the long-lived

triplet state) to be understood. To date, only low-
resolution DR measurements for Li+ have been carried
out [5]; the integrated ground-state and metastable re-
combination rates could be extracted, but more detailed
comparisons between experiment and theory for speciﬁc
excited-state conﬁgurations were not possible.

Here we report a high-resolution investigation of DR
in Li+. Individual intermediate-excited state conﬁgura-
tions contributing to DR could be resolved for ground-
state Li+(1s2 1S) ions, where DR occurs via ∆n = 1 res-
onances (1s2 + e → 1s2ln′l′) at relative electron–ion en-
ergies of 53–64 eV, as well as for metastable Li+(1s2s 3S)
ions which give rise to ∆n = 0 resonances (1s2s + e →
1s2ln′l′) below 3.2 eV. The metastable spectrum is found
to be particularly rich with many closely-spaced transi-
tions. The time dependence of DR from metastable ions
was also used to determine the radiative lifetime of the
2 3S level. Moreover, RR has been observed for relative
electron–ion energies close to zero.

At the Heidelberg ion-storage ring and electron cooler
facility (TSR) a beam of 13.3 MeV 7Li+ ions was pro-
duced in a tandem accelerator and injected into the ring.
Using multiturn stacking injection, which lasted about
0.1 ms, a typical circulating ion current of 5 µA was
obtained. While stored, the ions passed through the
collinear electron beam of the electron cooler. First, by
matching the electron and ion velocities at a laboratory
electron energy of 1.04 keV (‘cooling energy’) the ion
beam was phase-space cooled to low (∼0.3 mrad) diver-
gence and ∼10−4 relative longitudinal momentum spread
within about 10 s. Recombination of the Li+ ions was
then measured as a function of the energy E correspond-
ing to the average relative velocity between the electrons
and the ions (referred to as relative energy) by detuning
the laboratory electron energy from the cooling energy
by a variable amount. In the measurements, the relative
energy was alternately set (on a time scale of millisec-
onds) ﬁrst to E ≈ 140 eV to determine the background
recombination rate, then to a desired value in the energy
ranges of ground- or metastable-state recombination, and
then back to the cooling energy.

Those ions which recombined to form neutral Li are no
longer deﬂected by the storage ring dipole magnet follow-
ing the electron cooler, and can thus be counted with a
surface-barrier detector behind this magnet. Field ion-

ization in the motional electric ﬁeld experienced by the
fast Li atoms in the dipole magnet introduces a principal
quantum number cutoﬀ [6] of nc = 7 so that atoms reach-
ing the magnet in states with n > nc are not detected.

The energy resolution was determined by the electron
temperatures of kT⊥ = 18 meV and kTk = 0.2 meV [7],
which resulted in a FWHM energy spread of ∼0.02 eV in
the electron–ion center-of-mass (c.m.) frame at E <∼ 0.2
eV, increasing to ∼0.4 eV at E = 60 eV. The electron
current was 35 mA in the lower and 60 mA in the up-
per energy range, respectively, corresponding to electron
densities ne of 5 and 8 × 106 cm−3.

Recombination was measured in a time interval of 12–
70 s after each injection, the total cycle time being close
to the 1/e storage lifetime of ∼60 s determined by the
ground-state stripping rate in the rest gas, λs
g. Measure-
ments were repeated for successive injections over sev-
eral hours. From earlier experiments [8] employing laser
cooling of 7Li+ ions on the 2 3S-2 3P transition, a sub-
m ≈ 0.1–0.3 of metastable 2 3S
stantial initial fraction f 0
ions is known to exist in the TSR under these running
conditions. The unknown initial fraction of metastable
singlet (2 1S) ions is expected to have decayed by the
time the data were recorded. The decay constant of the
triplet (2 3S) metastable Li+ ions stored in the ring was
∼(19 s)−1, given mainly by the sum of the rest-gas strip-
m and the radiative decay rate λγ
ping rate λs
mg of the
metastable ions. Stripping of 2 3S ions is expected [9] to
occur faster than that of 1 1S ions because of the lower
ionization potential of the triplet state. The energy re-
gion of metastable DR (E = 0–3.5 eV) was scanned in the
two time intervals of 12–42 and 54–70 s after injection,
while the ground-state DR spectrum (E = 52–64 eV)
was measured between 42–54 s. Details concerning the
determination of the relative energy and the c.m. elec-
tron energy distribution can be found in Ref. [10]. The
accuracy of the relative-energy scale is estimated to be
±0.02 eV at 1 eV and ±0.09 at 60 eV.

With the recombination rate coeﬃcients αg(E) and
αm(E) for ground and metastable ions, respectively, and
the metastable ion fraction fm(t), the measured, back-
ground subtracted recombination rate is given by

R(E, t) = ηγ−2 · Ni(t) · ne
×

h(cid:16)1 − fm(t)(cid:17)αg(E) + fm(t)αm(E)i ,

(1)

where γ = 1.002 is the Lorentz factor due to the rel-
ativistic transformation between the ion rest frame and
the laboratory frame, and η the ratio between the interac-
tion length (1.5 m) and the ring circumference (55.4 m).
The number of stored ions Ni(t) was determined from the
circulating beam current measured by a non-destructive
current probe as well as by counting events at a beam
proﬁle monitor [11].

In addition to the energy scans, the time depen-
dence of the recombination rate on selected DR peaks
fast scans
was measured, performing a sequence of

m + λq

mg + λe

mg + λγ

m, where λq

over resonances at E = 0.14 and 1.2 eV (representing
mainly metastable-ion DR) and 54 eV (representing only
ground-state DR); simultaneously the beam current sig-
nals from the current probe and the beam proﬁle moni-
tor as well as the count rates at E = 0 and at E = 140
eV were recorded. The scan sequence was repeated 25
times after each injection, covering storage times of 12–
75 s. The integrated count rates were ﬁtted jointly as
functions of time by two-component exponential decay
curves, varying the two decay constants common to all
curves and appropriate separate amplitudes. Under the
assumption (justiﬁed below) that collisional re-feeding of
the metastable state by rest gas collisions can be ne-
glected, the two resulting time constants are λ1 = λs
g
and λ2 = λs
mg denotes
the collisional quenching rate and λe
m is the electron im-
pact ionization rate [12] of metastable ions in the electron
cooler occuring while the relative energy is above the 2 3S
ionization threshold (the same eﬀect for ground-state ions
is negligible). Measurements of the time variation at ﬁve
residual gas pressures diﬀering by factors of up to ∼3
yielded for λ1,2 the results shown in Fig. 1. As λs
m,
and λq
mg all vary proportional to the rest gas pressure,
(λs
g can be deduced from the slope of the
straight line through these data, while the rest-gas in-
dependent decay rate λγ
mg + λe
m of the metastable state
follows from linear extrapolation to λ1 = 0. After sub-
traction of the estimated [12] electron impact ionization
m = 0.003 ± 0.001 s−1 the radiative decay rate of
rate of λe
mg = 0.0191±0.0018 s−1 is obtained, which corresponds
λγ
to a natural lifetime of τM1 = 52.2 ± 5.0 s (1σ error) for
the 2 3S level. This result matches well the existing the-
oretical predictions [13,14] of 49.04–49.14 s as well as the
only previous experimental result of τM1 = 58.6 ± 12.9 s
(2σ error) [15]. The fact that the slope of λ2 vs. λ1 lies
close to the expected ratio of the metastable and ground-
state rest-gas stripping rates (∼2 [9]) indicates that the
collisional quenching rate was small.

After normalization to the ion number Ni(t) the time-
dependent rate in the 54-eV peak is proportional to
1 − fm(t) [see Eq. (1)], while the rates in the 0.14- and
1.2-eV peaks dominantly vary as fm(t) with a small ad-
ditional contribution from ground-state RR that could
be estimated. Fits to the normalized rates in the 54-eV
peak yielded only rather inaccurate results for the initial
metastable fraction fm(0) = f 0
m, scattering between 0.1
and 0.4, because the change of the ground-state fraction
1 − fm(t) during the measuring time was only slightly
larger than the statistical counting errors. Correspond-
ing ﬁts to the low-E peaks (focusing on the signal decay
at longer storage times) allowed the rate of collisional
re-feeding of the 2 3S state to be estimated to be <0.02
of the ground-state stripping rate λs
g, justifying the as-
sumption made above within the statistical error limits.
The rates R(E, t) were converted to the experimental
rate coeﬃcients αg(E) and αm(E) using Eq. (1); appro-
priate rate equations together with the measured time
constants λ1,2 yielded the functional dependence fm(t).

In the low energy range (0–3.5 eV) the measured rates
contain contributions to DR and to RR from metastable
ions [αm(E)] and to RR from ground-state ions [αg(E)].
They were extracted separately combining the data from
the two storage time intervals in which this energy region
was scanned. The experimental recombination rate coef-
ﬁcient αm(E) for metastable Li+ ions is shown in Fig. 2.
Also shown is the theoretical rate coeﬃcient (see below)
for both DR and RR convoluted with the experimen-
tal electron velocity distribution. The intrinsic determi-
nation of the metastable fraction being too inaccurate,
it was set to f 0
m = 0.19, which yields the best agree-
ment of the data between 0.25 and 0.35 eV (see bottom
part of ﬁgure) with the theoretical prediction. Thus, f 0
m
is adjusted to ﬁt the calculated non-resonant (RR) rate
of metastable Li+. Diﬀerent values of f 0
m would essen-
tially scale the experimental result for αm(E) as ∝ 1/f 0
m.
The value of f 0
m = 0.19 is compatible with the observed
time dependences, as well as with the values estimated
from earlier laser cooling experiments [8]. The system-
atic error in the normalization to the ion and electron
beam intensity is estimated to ±20%; however, in view
of the uncertainty in f 0
m we attribute an overall system-
atic error of ±50% to αm(E). The resulting smooth
ground-state RR rate coeﬃcient αg reaches a value of
(2 ± 1) × 10−12 cm3 s−1 at near-zero relative energy and
drops to (2 ± 1) × 10−13 cm3 s−1 at E = 0.3 eV.

In the high energy range (52–65 eV) only ∆n = 1 DR
of ground-state ions occurs, the contribution from the
RR of metastable and ground-state ions being negligible.
(∆n = 1 DR of metastable Li+ ions, leading to triply
excited Li, lies in diﬀerent energy regions not scanned
in this experiment.) The DR rate coeﬃcient αg(E) for
ground-state Li+ ions is shown in Fig. 3. The uncer-
tainty in f 0
m here yields only a small contribution to the
systematic error since the metastable fraction at the time
of measurement is already down to <∼ 0.04. Hence, a sys-
tematic error of ±20% is estimated for αg(E).

To obtain the theoretical rate coeﬃcients shown in
Figs. 2 and 3 uniﬁed photorecombination cross sections
representing both DR and RR were computed in LS
coupling using a radiation damped R-matrix approach
[16,17]. In fact, this case is one of the few where damp-
ing is negligible [18], and we obtained the same results
by applying detailed balance to undamped R-matrix pho-
toionization cross sections. To compare the calculations
with experiment, contributions to DR where one of the
electrons occupies a conﬁguration with n′ > nc = 7 were
excluded from the calculations. The ∆n = 0 DR spec-
trum of metastable Li+ ions (Fig. 2) is dominated by n′-
manifolds converging to the 2 3S-2 1P excitation thresh-
old at 3.2 eV [conﬁgurations 1s2p(1P )n′l′]. At low ener-
gies terms of the conﬁguration 1s2p(3P )3l′ also appear.
There is good agreement between theory and experiment
up to 0.6 eV, although the theoretical line energies seem
to be too high by ∼0.03 eV and the double structure of
the peak at 0.14 eV is not reproduced. At higher energies
the theory appears to overestimate the DR cross section

signiﬁcantly, but still yields a resonable representation of
the general spectral shape.

It appears that with nc = 7 we do not account for the
recombination rate observed above 3 eV. This is proba-
bly due to Li atoms formed with n > nc, cascading to
lower n states during the time-of-ﬂight (0.3 µs) prior to
the dipole magnets. Furthermore, the sharp cutoﬀ nc
represents only an approximate description of the ﬁeld
ionization process [6]. Particularly large discrepancies
between theory and experiment occur above the 2 3S-
2 3P excitation threshold (2.28 eV). Here, states with
high angular momentum l′ ≥ 3 strongly contribute to
the calculated DR rate, as demonstrated by eliminating
these states from the calculation (lower, dashed curve in
Fig. 2). Using this l cutoﬀ brings the calculated DR rate
much closer in magnitude to the experiment. The possi-
bility that Li atoms in high l states (formed by radiative
stabilization of high-l resonances) suﬀer ﬁeld ionization
even below the cutoﬀ nc can probably be ruled out. A
possible experimental explanation for these discrepancies
could arise from stray electric ﬁelds in the interaction re-
gion, estimated to be <∼ 3 V/cm; the DR rate above ∼1.9
eV is reduced by autoionization into additional open con-
tinua (1s2s 1S, 1s2p 3P ) and, as remains to be veriﬁed in
detail, high-l resonances may assume larger autoioniza-
tion rates than calculated through l-mixing in the stray
electric ﬁelds.

Regarding the ground-state DR (Fig. 3) experiment
and theory are in good agreement for the 1s2l2l′ conﬁg-
urations near 54 and 56 eV. These terms are well known
from ion–atom collision [19,20] and photoionization stud-
ies [21,22]. Along the 1s2p(1P )n′l′ series one higher res-
onance, probably from 1s2p(1P )3l′, is observed near 60
eV, but higher series members apparently are reduced
by autoionization into the 1s2l continua. Near 60 eV the
energy-integrated theoretical rate coeﬃcient, represent-
ing several unresolved DR resonances, exceeds the exper-
imental value (apparently a single resonance) by about a
factor of 3. Also, the calculations predict a higher peak
near 62 eV due to Rydberg states with n = 4–7.

In summary, Li+ ions with a strong population of the
long-lived 2 3S state were stored for times on the order
of the natural lifetime of the metastable level. This life-
time was determined with an error of ±10%, conﬁrming
the theoretical predictions. Experimental DR rate coef-
ﬁcients were obtained separately for the metastable and
the ground state. DR from the 2 3S ions shows a rich
spectrum of lines from doubly excited, higher angular
momenta conﬁgurations of Li that cannot be reached by
photoionization from the Li ground state and have not
been observed before; their description presents a sig-
niﬁcant and important challenge to the theory of this
fundamental two-electron system. An R-matrix calcu-
lation reproduces the spectral shape reasonably well.
The ground-state DR spectrum shows three prominent
and several weaker lines at energies of 54–62 eV, and
there is reasonable agreement with theoretical calcula-
tions except for lines near the 1s2l excitation thresholds

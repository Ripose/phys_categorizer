Abstract

The Impulse Compton Proﬁles (CP’s) J(q) and the hpni− expectation

values for some inert gas atoms(He-Kr) are computed and compared within

the Harbola-Sahni (HS), Hartree-Fock (HF) theories and a Self Interaction

Corrected (SIC) density functional model. The Compton proﬁles for excited

states of Helium atom are also calculated. While the calculated CP’s are

found to generally agree, they diﬀer slightly from one another for small values

of the Compton parameter q and are in good agreement for large q values.

The < pn > expectation values within the three theories are also found to be

comparable. The HS formalism is seen to mimic HF reasonably well in the

momentum space, establishing the logical consistency of the former.

In the phenomenon of Compton scattering, the Compton cross section (of high energy

the electron-momentum density. In the so-termed impulse approximation [1] the Compton

cross section is proportional to an experimentally observable quantity, viz. the Compton

sample the interior as well as exterior regions of the EMD and are also related to atomic

properties. The < 1/p > moment is twice the peak value of the impulse proﬁle J(0); the

< p2 > moment is twice the kinetic energy (= −Etotal, by the virial theorem) while the < p >

moment is empirically found to be almost proportional to the exact Hartree-Fock exchange

energy [4].

The recent Harbola-Sahni approach [5,6] to the atomic structure calculations proﬀers an

attractive alternative to the conventional Hartree-Fock description. The HS approach has

been proven to be successful in giving the total energies [7,8] and co-ordinate space properties

[9,10] practically of Hartree-Fock quality. In addition, coupled with local correlation, it also

describes the excited states of atoms quite accurately [11]. This success of the HS formalism

prompts one for its critical appraisal in the momentum space through Compton proﬁles

and and the < pn > expectation values. We also compare these with the corresponding

quantities calculated within the HF, the HS and the self interaction corrected (SIC) local

density functional theories. This study is aimed at bringing out how these ~p−space quantities

calculated using the local and orbital-independent prescription of HS compare with those

of the HF theory, which employs a nonlocal potential (in its exact exchange description),

and of SIC theory in which the eﬀective potential, although local, turns out to be orbital-

dependent. In the following we ﬁrst brieﬂy describe the HF, HS and SIC theories to highlight

the diﬀerences among them.

All the three theories HF, HS and SIC are independent particle theories in which the

electron orbitals are obtained by solving the equations (Hartree atomic units i.e. ¯h = |e| =

m = 1 are used throughout herein), viz.

ψi = ǫiψi;
i

i = 1, 2, ....N,

(5)

where vH (~r) = vnuclear(~r)+

d3r′ is the Hartree potential and vx the exchange potential.

Here ρ(~r) is the electronic density given in terms of orbitals ψi(~r) as ρ(~r) =

i fi|ψi(~r)|2. The

P

diﬀerences in HF, HS and SIC precisely lies in the manner in which the exchange potential is

prescribed in them. In HF which is the exact theory at the “exchange-only” level, as noted

above, the potential vx is nonlocal with its action on ψi(~r) is given by

vx(~r)ψi(~r) =

|~r − ~r′|

d3r′.

On the other hand, the exchange potential in the exchange-only HS theory is local and

is prescribed as the work done in moving an electron in the ﬁeld of its Fermi hole [5]:

where

vx(~r) = Wx(~r) = −

| ~r − ~r′|3 (~r − ~r′) d3r′,

is the exchange “electric ﬁeld” due to the Fermi hole (or the “Exchange hole”) ρx(~r, ~r′).

In the SIC theory the exchange potential is calculated within the local-density approxi-

mation (LDA) which is then ad-hocly corrected for its self-interaction on an orbital-by-orbital

basis [12]. Thus the orbital dependent SIC exchange potential is given as

where ρi(~r) =| ψi(~r) |2 is the orbital density.

In the context of HS potential, it may be noted that as recently established by Holas and

March [13], the Harbola-Sahni exchange-correlation potential can also be calculated from

the exact second-order density matrix by employing the diﬀerential virial theorem. The

results are consistent with, and provide the mathematical proof of the formalism proposed

by HS. In addition, it also spells out how the kinetic energy term missing [5,6] from the

HS potential arises from the diﬀerences in the exact kinetic energy density tensor and its

Slater-Kohn-Sham orbitals counterpart [13]. Similar analysis carried out within the Hartree-

Fock theory [14] reveal that the diﬀerence between the exact KS exchange-only potential

and the HS potential is traced back to the diﬀerences in the kinetic energy density tensors

of the HF theory and its local counterpart (as such, this diﬀerence is indeed only marginal)

[14]. Further, within a local prescription, it is not clear as to how one incorporates the

kinetic-energy eﬀects directly in a self-consistent-ﬁeld (SCF) scheme.

In this work the spherically averaged Compton Proﬁles J(q) within the HF theory are

computed using the near Hartree-Fock(NHF) quality wavefunctions that employ the STO

(Slater-Type-orbital) bases tabulated by Clementi and Roetti [15] and the values of the

< pn > moments are from Ref. [16]. On the other hand, the orbitals with eﬀective potential

Wx are obtained by a modiﬁed Herman-Skillman code [17]. The calculated Compton proﬁles

along with their available experimental [18,19] and accurate theoretical counterparts [20] are

tabulated in tables I-IV for inert atomic systems He-Kr while the moments are displayed

in tables V-VII. The Helium atom in its ground state has a single orbital, hence all the

CP’s within these three exchange-only theories practically coincide (cf. Table I). For Ne,

Ar and Kr, it is evident from the Tables II-V that for low q− values the CP’s diﬀer from

each other appreciably. For higher q− values these theoretical (HF, HS, SIC) proﬁles are in

better agreement with one another. In the low q− region (q < 0.5au), the SIC proﬁles are

seen to be the largest and the HS proﬁles are the smallest in magnitude among the three

theories. Beyond q ∼ 0.5a.u. the three proﬁles cross each other and are in good agreement

in the asymptotic region. It is observed further that the “experimental” J(q) is fairly well

estimated by the “exchange only” theories. It is to be noted that an accurate theoretical

J(q) computation beyond HF, viz. the conﬁguration interaction calculation for Ne, due

to Tripathi et al. [20] while improving upon the HF-CP still slightly underestimates the

experimental J(0) but overestimates the intermediate proﬁle. The higher values of J(q) in

the SIC theory indicate that the momentum density is localized near the origin ~p = ~0 in

the SIC formalism. This can also be seen from the of < p−2 > and < p−1 > values which, as

pointed out above, sample the interior region of the EMD. The higher the momentum density

near the origin the greater are the values of these moments. That these moments have largest

values in the SIC formalism may be qualitatively explained as follows: The region near the

origin in the momentum space by Fourier- reciprocity, corresponds to the asymptotic region

in the position space. In the density functional theory (DFT) the asymptotic decay of the co-

ordinate space electron density goes as ∼ exp(−2

2|ǫmax| r), where ǫmax is the eigenvalue

of the highest occupied orbital [21]. The highest occupied orbital energy eigenvalues for

q

5

these systems in the SIC formalism are smaller in magnitude compared to their HF and

HS counterparts. Consequently, the coordinate-space electron density decays slowly in SIC

than in the HS and HF theories, leading therefore to higher values of < p−2 > and < p−1 >

moments. The larger values of the HF proﬁles than HS proﬁles near q = 0 can also be

explained similarly.

In the HF theory (unlike in DFT), all the orbitals decay with the

same exponent (∼ exp(−

2|ǫmax

HF | r)) asymptotically (ǫmax

HF , here is the highest occupied HF

q

orbital energy eigenvalue) [22] which by reciprocity, reﬂects in the slower decay of γ(~p) in

the small |~p|, resulting therefore in slightly larger values of < 1/p2 >, < 1/p > moments and

JHF (q) (near q = 0) as compared to their HS counterparts. Amongst the various moments,

the agreement among these theories is the best for the < p2 > moments. The HF and HS

values of this moment are very close, agreeing up to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures in case of Ne

and Ar, and up to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures for Kr. This agreement is however not surprising

since this moment is essentially the double of the negative of the total energy (by the virial

theorem) and the HS theory is known to produce the total energies which are practically

equivalent to their HF counterparts. Further, the < p > and < p3 > moments are also found

to be comparable in the three theories. The < p4 > moments within HS agree with their

corresponding HF and/or SIC values. Thus, the HS theory with its local prescription for

the exchange potential seen to mimic the Hartree-Fock formalism reasonably well in the

momentum space. Our study on the detailed structure of the radially projected ﬁrst order

reduced density matrix [3] also supports this similarity between the HS and HF density

matrices: striking similarities are observed in the structure(contours) of reduced ﬁrst order

density matrix in the momentum space.

The HS theory also oﬀers a simpler description of the bound excited states in comparison

with the HF description. This is because the HS formalism is not based on the variational

principle, but rather on the physical eﬀect of the Pauli and Coulomb correlations; which has

prompted us to compute the CPs for the excited states of helium. Of course, the numerical

HF approach is also perfectly suitable for excited states with the orbitals identiﬁed from the

number of radial nodes (= n − l − 1) of a given radial part Rnl(r) of the orbital. However,

6

the appeal of the HS approach is that it is simple to implement than the numerical HF

scheme, yielding results that are practically equivalent to the latter. The CP’s calculated

for various excited states of Helium are presented in Table IX. The excited states of helium

atom will have diﬀused electron distribution in the position space and also will have higher

total energy. Consequently, the excited state CP’s will be more compact or localized in the

small q− region, as is evident from Table IX.

One naively expects that the HS Compton proﬁles may be improved by adding an accu-

rate local correlation to its eﬀective potential. It is observed, however, that addition of an

ad-hoc correlation (such as the Gunnarsson-Lundqvist [23] or Ceperly-Alder [24] prescrip-

tions) to the eﬀective HS potential results in an undesirable lowering of the peak-proﬁle. If

the correlation is added at right the level of exchange-correlation hole (ρx replaced by ρxc in

Eq.[8] ) and then the HS computations be performed self-consistently, an improvement over

the “exchange only” J(q) is expected. On the other hand, though the work of Holas and

March [13] as pointed above prescribes an inclusion of the kinetic piece of correlation in the

KS context it is not known how one actually implements their scheme in practice. These

studies of course, go beyond the scope of the present “exchange-only” theme.

In this paper, we have carried out a comparative study of the momentum space properties

of atoms viz. Compton proﬁles and various expectation values calculated within the “work

formalism” of Harbola and Sahni, the Hartree-Fock theory as well as the Self-Interaction-

corrected Local Density Approximation theory. The Compton proﬁles for various excited

states of the Helium atoms are also presented within the work formalism. The present work

demonstrates that the Harbola-Sahni work formalism which in position space closely follows

the HF theory also seen to do so in the momentum space.

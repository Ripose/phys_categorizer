what follows, we present the results of our experiments
conducted on a three-dimensional lattice of cesium atoms
in the oscillating regime in which the oscillatory motion
of the trapped atoms is only rarely interrupted by in-
elastic photon scattering events. The converse case of
optical lattices operating in the jumping regime has been
treated by Mennerat-Robilliard and co-workers [10]. In
our experiments the intensity, detuning, and geometry of
the lattice were varied independently, and the resulting
variations of the positions and widths of the vibrational
Raman peaks were measured and compared with theo-
retical models.
In another set of experiments, we loaded an optical lat-
tice with atoms having an initial kinetic temperature
higher than the steady-state temperature in the lattice
and made time-resolved measurements of the vibrational
frequency as the atoms came to equilibrium in the lat-
tice. As the distribution of atoms amongst the vibra-
tional states evolved, the measured vibrational frequency
was observed to change owing to the perturbations to the
energy spacings of the bound levels caused by the anhar-
monicity of the potential.
This paper is organised as follows. In section II the exper-
imental setup is described, and in section III we present
the results of the experiments. Section IV contains a brief
discussion of the various mechanisms involved in deter-
mining the frequency widths of the vibrational Raman
resonances observed in optical lattices and a comparison
of the experimental data with theoretical models. Fi-
nally, section V summarizes our ﬁndings.

We use a method based on optical coherent transients to
study the vibrational coherence lifetimes of atoms trapped in
the potential wells of a near-resonant optical lattice in the os-
cillating regime. The dependence of the positions and widths
of the vibrational Raman resonances of the coherent transient
spectra on the intensity, detuning, and geometry of the lattice
beams is investigated and the results are compared with the-
oretical predictions. It is shown that the principal source of
broadening of the vibrational Raman resonances is the anhar-
monicity of the light-shift potential wells. We also perform
time-resolved measurements of the vibrational excitation of
atoms equilibrating in an optical lattice.

I. INTRODUCTION

In optical lattices [1], atoms are trapped in a peri-
odic array of micron-sized potential wells. Atoms con-
ﬁned in these potential wells exhibit a rich dynamical
behaviour which can be probed by a number of tech-
niques, including probe absorption spectroscopy [2], het-
erodyne ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [3], recoil-induced res-
onances [4], intensity correlation spectroscopy [5,6], and
observation of the redistribution of photons between the
lattice-inducing beams [7]. Using these techniques, the
quantized nature of the motion of the atoms in the po-
tential wells has been demonstrated, yielding information
on the vibrational frequencies of the atoms, the motion
of wavepackets, and on the decay of coherences between
the bound oscillator states. Recently, a novel method has
been suggested and experimentally demonstrated which
eﬀectively probes the coherences set up between diﬀer-
ent vibrational states of the trapped atoms [8,9]. This
method has a number of advantages over other schemes,
as we shall demonstrate. Most importantly, the possibil-
ity of selectively exciting one particular dynamical mode
of the lattice allows one to ﬁt theoretical predictions to
experimental spectra easily and reliably.
In this paper we are predominantly concerned with res-
onances of the coherent transient spectra corresponding
to stimulated Raman transitions between adjacent vibra-
tional levels. The mechanisms responsible for the decay
of the vibrational coherences and the resulting widths of
the Raman peaks are still a subject of debate, and a com-
prehensive study is as yet absent from the literature. In

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE

In our experiment, we trap and cool cesium atoms in a
standard six-beam magneto-optical trap (MOT) operat-
ing on the 6S1/2(F = 4) → 6P3/2(F ′ = 5) transition [11].
After a 1s trapping period, the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is
switched oﬀ and the atoms are further cooled for a few
milliseconds in an optical molasses to a temperature of
around 10µK. The molasses beams are then switched
oﬀ and the lattice beams switched on. The geometry of
the lattice beams is the standard tetrahedron conﬁgura-
tion [12,13] with splitting half-angles θx and θy, where in
our experiment θy is ﬁxed and θx is variable (see Fig. 1).
The lattice operates on the same transition as the MOT,
detuned to the low frequency side by 3Γ to 17Γ, where
1/Γ is the excited state lifetime (Γ = 2π × 5.22MHz for
cesium). The intensity of the lattice beams in our exper-
iment lies between 1.5mWcm−2 and 3.8mWcm−2. In ad-
dition to the four lattice beams, a weak (< 0.1mWcm−2)
probe beam propagates either along the x- or the z-axis.
The detuning δ of the probe laser from the lattice laser
can be controlled by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM)
connected to a tunable radio-frequency source.
Coherent transient spectra are recorded as follows: After
the atoms have equilibrated in the lattice for a few mil-
liseconds, the probe beam is switched on for 20 − 1000µs
at detuning δ (see also section IV). After that time, at
t = 0 the detuning is increased by 0.9MHz within less
than 1µs. After the increase in the detuning of the probe

light, it no longer interacts with the atoms and serves
as a local oscillator for the heterodyne detection of the
light scattered by the atoms in the lattice. The signal
arising from the beating of the lattice light scattered by
the atoms and the local oscillator is then recorded with a
fast photodiode. Assuming that the coherently scattered
light from the lattice decays exponentially with time at
a rate Γcoh, the observed signal (expressed as a voltage
V (t)) is of the form

V (t) ∝ pIprobeIcoh exp(−Γcoht) cos[(∆jump − δ)t]

,

(1)

+

(Iprobe + Icoh)

where Iprobe and Icoh are the intensities of the probe and
the coherently scattered light, respectively, and ∆jump
is the amount by which the probe frequency is suddenly
switched at t = 0. A Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) is
then performed on the signal to yield its frequency spec-
trum. Our spectra are shifted by subtracting the fre-
quency jump ∆jump, so that a Rayleigh peak (for which
δ = 0 initially) appears at zero frequency in our spectra.
In the case of the time-resolved equilibration experiment
described in section III C, the lattice is loaded directly
from the MOT with a temperature of order 60µK, and
the atoms are then allowed to equilibrate in the lattice
for a variable length of time. After this period the vi-
brational excitation of the trapped atoms is probed and
read-out as described above.

method. In each case, a single feature of the complete spec-
trum is selectively excited. The magniﬁed plot inset in (a)
shows more clearly the response around the frequencies of

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Some aspects of the dynamical behaviour of atoms in
optical lattices are better understood than others. The
vibrational frequencies of the atoms, for instance, can be
rather accurately predicted and modelled using a simple
harmonic oscillator picture (for potential wells that are
deep enough for a tight-binding model to be valid) [12].
Discrepancies with experiments can be accounted for by
the anharmonicity of the potential, which can be treated
perturbatively [14].
On the other hand, the lifetimes of atoms in these oscilla-
tor states and of the coherences between diﬀerent states,
and hence the widths they give rise to in the coherent
transient spectra, are not yet well understood. Several
mechanisms have been proposed that could be responsi-
ble for the observed widths of these vibrational Raman
peaks [15–17]. In particular, the photon scattering rate of
atoms in a light ﬁeld turns out to be much larger than the
observed widths of the Raman peaks, indicating that the
decay of coherences between vibrational levels is strongly
suppressed. The mechanisms responsible for this sup-
pression will be dealt with in more detail in section IV A.
In order to carry out a comprehensive study, we inde-
pendently varied the detuning, intensity, and geometry
(characterized by the two splitting angles) of the lattice
and determined both the position and the width of the
Raman peaks in the coherent transient spectrum by ﬁt-
ting Lorentzians to the experimentally obtained spectra.
Typical experimental results are shown in Fig. 2. The
signal-to-noise ratio even of a single-shot measurement
is good, so that little averaging is necessary. The signal
recorded by the photodiode is, in general, a sum of expo-
nentially damped beat-notes between the light scattered
by the trapped atoms and the probe light. When the
probe is initially tuned to the same frequency as the lat-
tice beams, one sees a narrow Rayleigh peak and two
peaks resulting from oﬀ-resonantly excited vibrational
coherences. When detuning the probe from the lattice
beams by an amount equal to the separation between
a Raman peak and the Rayleigh peak (i.e.
the vibra-
tional frequency of the atoms), one can selectively excite
the vibrational Raman coherences alone and hence ob-
tain a spectrum that only reﬂects one excitation mode
of the lattice, in contrast to probe absorption spectra,
where resonances associated with many modes are su-
perimposed. It is found that the resulting spectrum can
be well ﬁtted to a Lorentzian, and in what follows we
will refer to the width (FWHM) of such a Lorentzian
ﬁt as the width of the Raman peak. A further advan-

tage of the method of coherent transients is the fact that
the preparation and the read-out of the vibrational co-
herence grating are separated in time. The frequency-
selectivity in the excitation phase therefore depends on
the frequency bandwidth of the initial probe pulse, whilst
the resolution of the spectrum only depends on the read-
out time. By making the read-out time as short as pos-
sible whilst maintaining a reasonable resolution, time-
dependent studies of the evolution of atoms in an optical
lattice can be performed. This is discussed in more detail
in section III C.
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the Rayleigh peaks are of much
smaller width than the Raman peaks. These widths yield
information on the rate of transfer of atoms between
neighbouring wells and are discussed in detail in [15,9].
In this paper, however, we shall concentrate our atten-
tion on the vibrational Raman peaks.

A. Varying intensity and detuning

For a tetrahedral lattice (see Fig. 1) in which the po-
larizations of the four lattice beams are perpendicular to
the planes spanned by each pair of nearly co-propagating
beams, one can derive simple expressions for the vibra-
tional frequencies in a harmonic approximation of the
potential close to a minimum [12,14]:

where Er = ¯hωr is the recoil energy with ωr = 2π ×

and light tuned close to the D2 resonance line and U0 is
the potential well-depth given by

U0 = ¯h∆

(4)

(I is the intensity of a single beam, Isat = 1.1mWcm−2,
and ∆ = ωlaser −ω0 is the detuning of the lattice beams).
These theoretical predictions have been veriﬁed to yield
the correct dependence on ∆, I, and θ, but the exper-
imental results usually fall short of the theoretical val-
ues by 15-25 percent. In our experiment, we varied the
potential well-depth U0 (ranging from U0 ≈ 250Er to
U0 ≈ 2100Er) both by varying the intensity (between
I = 1.5mWcm−2 and I = 3.6mWcm−2) and the detun-
ing (between ∆ = −3Γ and ∆ = −17Γ) and measured the
positions of the Raman peaks of the corresponding coher-
ent transient spectra along the x- and the z- directions.
The results of these measurements are summarized in
Fig. 3 (a) and conﬁrm the dependence of the vibrational
frequencies on U0 as given by equations 2 and 3. The
splitting half-angles in this experiment were θx = 41 ± 1
degrees and θy = 38 ± 1 degrees, and the ratio of the
slopes of Fig. 3 (a) is 1.83 ± 0.05, which is close to the
theoretically predicted value of 1.67 ± 0.06.
The results of measurements of the Raman widths for the
cases of the probe propagating along both the x- and the
z-directions are shown in Fig. III A(b) where, for clar-
ity, most of the error bars have been omitted [18]. For
the most part, the width of the Raman peaks and the
corresponding vibrational frequencies are proportional to
each other, with ∆Ω ≈ 0.45Ω. Only for frequencies above
≈ 70kHz do the Raman widths deviate appreciably from
this simple relationship.

B. Varying the geometry

In order to investigate the dependence of the position
and width of the Raman peaks on the geometry of the
lattice, the intensity and detuning of the lattice beams
(and hence U0) were kept ﬁxed ﬁxed at I = 3.6mWcm−2
and ∆ = −7Γ, respectively, and the splitting-angle θx
was varied. This resulted in a change in the lattice con-
stants in the x- and z-directions. In our setup, θx could
be varied between 15±1 and 40±1 degrees, which accord-
ing to equations 2 and 3 should result in a large variation
in Ωx,y, but only a small variation in Ωz. Figure 4 (a)
shows the results of the measurements of Ωx as a function
of sin θx. As expected, there is a linear relationship, and
again the experimentally measured frequencies lie about
20 percent below the theoretical values.
The measurements of the Raman widths as a function

of geometry are summarized in Fig. 4 (b), where ∆Ωx
is plotted against Ωx. As before, there is a linear rela-
tionship between the two, with ∆Ωx ≈ 0.53Ωx. Within
the experimental errors, this agrees with the empirical
constant of proportionality found in section III A.

was recorded in about 1ms. Figure 5 shows the results of
the corresponding temperature and vibrational frequency
measurements. The temperature of the atoms reaches its
steady-state value governed by the lattice parameters in a
few milliseconds [20]. At the same time, the measured vi-
brational frequency of the atoms increases as the atoms
are cooled and then approaches as steady-state value.
These results can alternatively be visualized by plotting
the measured vibrational frequency against temperature
(Fig. 6). Evidently, the colder the atoms are, the higher
is the observed vibrational frequency. This can be under-
stood in terms of the anharmonicity of the lattice poten-
tial, as will be explained in more detail in section IV B.
Brieﬂy, the hotter the atoms are, the larger the popu-
lation of higher-lying (and more anharmonically shifted)
vibrational states in the potential wells will be, which
results in a lower observed vibrational frequency.

IV. THEORETICAL DISCUSSION

C. Time-resolved probing of the lattice evolution

A. Mechanisms contributing to the width of the

vibrational Raman peaks

In most of the work previously carried out on the ex-
citation modes of atoms in optical lattices, the atoms
were allowed to reach equilibrium in the potential wells
before measurements were performed. To demonstrate
that we can use the coherent transient technique for
time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic studies, we
loaded our lattice directly from the MOT, skipping the
molasses phase. The temperature of the atoms released
from the MOT was about 60µK. The lattice was then
switched on for a variable amount of time, after which
either the temperature was measured (using the time-
of-ﬂight method [19]), or a coherent transient spectrum

As mentioned before, whereas the dependence of the
vibrational frequencies on the lattice parameters is well
understood and can be theoretically modelled, the widths
of the Raman peaks of the spectra have so far resisted a
comprehensive explanation. In this section, we shall sum-
marize the models proposed so far and discuss them in
the light of our ﬁndings. Also, we give a brief overview of
the results obtained by other groups and compare them
to our own experimental results.
The ﬁrst rate to consider when dealing with the life-
times of vibrational levels in optical lattices and coher-
ences between those levels is the photon scattering rate

5

Γ′ = ΓU0/¯h∆. After the ﬁrst observation of distinct Ra-
man resonances in probe-absorption spectra it was soon
realized that the lifetimes could not be determined by Γ′
since that would have meant that (for most experimental
parameters) the resonances would not have been resolv-
able. The experimentally observed widths, however, were
more than an order of magnitude smaller than those pre-
dicted by the photon scattering rate. Courtois et al. [15]
proposed the Lamb-Dicke eﬀect [21] arising from sub-
wavelength localization of the atoms as an explanation
for the unexpected narrowness of the resonances [22].
According to this theory, the rate of inelastic scattering
events in which the vibrational quantum number changes
is reduced by the Lamb-Dicke factor (n + 1)Er/¯hΩ in
favour of elastic scattering events involving no change
in vibrational level. For typical parameters, the Lamb-
Dicke factor is of the order of 1/10 or less, so that the
inelastic scattering rate Γ′′ ∝ Γ′(n+1)Er/¯hΩ comes close
to the experimentally observed widths. In experiments
involving shallow potentials with small Lamb-Dicke pa-
rameters, however, Kozuma et al.
still found lifetimes
that were much longer than predicted by the Lamb-Dicke
model. Phillips et al. interpreted this as evidence for the
existence of the transfer in inelastic scattering processes
of coherence between diﬀerent pairs of vibrational lev-
els. Also, results of other experiments suggested that
the broadening of the vibrational Raman resonances was
dominated by the anharmonicity of the lattice potential,
which was further demonstrated through the observation
of revivals in wavepacket oscillations. In the following,
we will show that our experiments support that inter-
pretation. Before discussing the experimental ﬁndings in
detail, however, we shall give a brief outline of the eﬀects
of anharmonicity in optical lattices.

B. Eﬀects of anharmonicity

When deriving the expressions for the vibrational fre-
quencies of atoms in optical lattices (equations 2 and 3),
the true light-shift potentials are often approximated by
harmonic potentials characterized by the curvature of the
lattice potentials close to a local minimum. The eﬀect of
the anharmonicity of the potential can be treated pertur-
batively by considering the correction due to the fourth-
order term in the expansion of the potential in ﬁrst-order
perturbation theory. Taking into account the geometrical
factor sin θx characterizing the lattice constant in the x-
direction, this leads to the vibrational frequency Ωn,n+1
associated with a pair of adjacent vibrational levels char-
acterized by n and n + 1 being reduced with respect to
the harmonic frequency Ω0 so that

Ωn,n+1 ≈ Ω0 − ωr(n + 1) sin2 θx

.

(5)

Assuming that in an optical lattice the vibrational lev-
els are populated according to a Boltzmann distribu-
tion [23], and that the ratio C = kBT /2U0 is a constant

6

(as has been shown experimentally [14]), the eﬀect of
the anharmonicity on the experimentally observed Ra-
man resonances can be estimated. Firstly, the observed
vibrational frequency can be deﬁned as an average over
all the anharmonically shifted pairs of vibrational levels,
weighted by their respective Boltzmann factors, leading
to the following expression [14]:

Ω ≈ Ω0(1 − 2C + ...)

.

(6)

This indicates that all the vibrational frequencies should
be reduced by a constant fraction, and that that frac-
tion will be proportional to the temperature T of the
atoms in the lattice for a constant well-depth U0. This
satisfactorily accounts for our observations presented in
section III C.
Likewise, the broadening of the resonance due to the pres-
ence of several vibrational frequencies can be modelled by
assuming that only levels with a Boltzmann factor (rela-
tive to that for n = 0) larger than some small, arbitrary
number b contribute appreciably to the observed spec-
trum. The most shifted vibrational frequency, which is a
measure of the frequency spread, is then given by

∆Ω ≈ sin θxC ln(b−1)ωrr U0

Er

=

C
2

ln(b−1)Ω0

.

(7)

This is proportional to the vibrational frequency Ω0 for
any value of b, so that we would expect that the true
linewidth, calculated from a properly weighted sum over
all vibrational levels, also to be proportional to Ω0. This
is precisely what we observe in our experiments. Figure 7
illustrates the dependence of the vibrational frequency
and width of the Raman peak on the geometrical factor
sin θx. In a more quantitative treatment, we have per-
formed numerical simulations of the coherent transient
spectra taking into account the frequency spread by su-
perposing the contributions of all possible pairs of vibra-
tional levels. The results exhibit the same characteristics
as the qualitative models described above.
In principle, the anharmonicity of the potential should
also manifest itself in an asymmetry of the Raman peak.
One expects a slower drop-oﬀ of the Raman peak on the
low frequency side because the anharmonic shifts are all
in the same direction (see equation 5). This eﬀect, how-
ever, will only be noticeable if the frequency spread due
to anharmonicity is appreciable compared to the widths
of the individual contributions, which are caused by the
dissipative mechanisms described above. In our experi-
ments, we have not found any clear evidence of an asym-
metry of the Raman peaks.
In Fig. 7, however, the
Lorentzian ﬁt to the broader Raman peak (b) has a larger
χ2-value then the narrower peak (a), which suggests that
the former is distorted by anharmonicity.

FIG. 7. Example of Raman peaks for two diﬀerent geome-
tries of the lattice with identical detuning and intensity of the
lattice beams. When the splitting-angle is increased, both the
position and the width of the Raman peak change. The dot-
ted lines are Lorentzian ﬁts.

C. Comparison of theory and experiment

One of the main objectives of our experiments was to
determine the dominant mechanism involved in deter-
mining the width of the Raman resonances in the coher-
ent transient spectra. In particular, we were interested
in establishing whether the Lamb-Dicke model correctly
predicted the dependence of the widths on all the experi-
mental parameters. Since our experiment was performed
on a 3-D lattice, whereas the Lamb-Dicke treatment of
Courtois et al. is based on calculations in one dimension,
we have generalized that derivation to take into account
the dependence of the lattice constant on the geometry
of the lattice. This leads to the appearance of an extra
geometrical factor sin θx in the expression for the rate
Γ′′(n) of inelastic Raman processes leading to a change
in the external state of the atom along the x-direction

from an initial state with vibrational quantum number,
n, which then becomes

Γ′′(n) ∝ Γ′ sin θx(n + 1)r Er

This reproduces the observed linear dependence of ∆Ω on
Ω when the splitting-angle θx is varied (see section III B).
It also turns out that when the lattice intensity is varied,
the expression for Γ′′ reduces to Γ′′ ∝ Ω. When U0 is
varied by changing the detuning, however, the relation-
ship between Ω and Γ′′ (and hence ∆Ω) is expected to
be of the form Γ′′ ∝ Ω3 (for large detuning), which is not
at all what we observe. In fact, upon closer inspection
the values of ∆Ω for identical Ω but diﬀerent detuning
do diﬀer slightly from each other, the value of ∆Ω for
the larger detuning being smaller, as expected. The dif-
ference, however, is very small and does not reﬂect the
predicted Ω3-dependence. This is perhaps only to be ex-
pected because, for the case of the largest detunings used
in these experiments, the proximity of the neighbouring
F = 4 → F ′ = 4 transition means that our approxi-
mation of an isolated transition is of dubious validity.
Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that the observed dependence of
∆Ω on Ω agrees very well with broadening due to anhar-
monicity, as derived above. These observations suggest
that the main broadening mechanism is, indeed, the an-
harmonicity of the potential, and the dissipative mech-
anisms based on inelastic photon scattering are strongly
suppressed. In the harmonic limit, where the homoge-
neous width is small compared to the anharmonic fre-
quency diﬀerence between successive vibrational levels,
the suppression of line-broadening because of the trans-
fer of vibrational coherence [24] between pairs of levels
in spontaneous Raman processes is expected to be ap-
preciable. The lifetimes of the vibrational coherences are
then determined by the cooling rate, rather than by the
inelastic photon scattering rate, which in the oscillating
regime is given by Γcool = 4ΓEr/¯h∆ [17] and, in our ex-
periments varies between 3kHz for small detuning to less
than 1kHz for the largest detuning employed. For large
detuning, the associated width is given by ∆Ω ∝ Ω2.
Conversely, in the anharmonic limit, it is the spatial lo-
calization that is expected to give rise to the suppres-
sion of inelastic Raman processes. Clearly, the interplay
between the transfer of coherence, the Lamb-Dicke nar-
rowing and the line broadening mechanisms is hard to
model quantitatively for an intermediate case. Never-
theless, our results strongly suggest that the broadening
associated with the anharmonicity generally dominates
the widths of the Raman peaks, with dissipative mecha-
nisms contributing at a much reduced level.

V. CONCLUSION

We used the method of coherent transients in order to
measure the vibrational frequencies of atoms in optical

[18] The errors on Ω and ∆Ω stem from the uncertainty in the
ﬁtting of the Lorentzian to the spectra. The smaller the
detuning, the greater the uncertainty due to the noise on
the signal. The uncertainty in the intensity measurements
was about 10 percent.

lattices and the widths associated with the corresponding
Raman peaks of the coherent transient spectra. Vary-
ing the intensity, detuning, and geometry of the lattices
beam, we conﬁrmed the validity of the theoretical predic-
tions for the vibrational frequencies based on a harmonic
oscillator model of the potential wells. Our measure-
ments of the Raman widths as a function of intensity,
detuning, and geometry all yielded a linear dependence
on the vibrational frequencies, which strongly suggests
that anharmonicity is the main broadening mechanism.
This implies that the decay of the coherence between ad-
jacent vibrational levels is suppressed, which we ascribe
to the combined eﬀects of the transfer of coherence be-
tween pairs of vibrational levels in inelastic Raman pro-
cesses and the suppression of the inelastic rate arising
from the sub-optical wavelength spatial localization. The
anharmonicity was also found to be responsible for a re-
duction in the observed vibrational frequencies relative
to the predictions of a harmonic model, which was tested
by measuring the vibrational frequencies of ensembles of
atoms with diﬀerent temperatures in otherwise identical
optical lattices.

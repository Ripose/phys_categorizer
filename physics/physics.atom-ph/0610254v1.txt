In recent publications, it has been shown that high-order harmonic generation can be manipulated
by employing a time-delayed attosecond pulse train superposed to a strong, near-infrared laser ﬁeld.
It is an open question, however, which is the most adequate way to approximate the attosecond pulse
train in a semi-analytic framework. Employing the Strong-Field Approximation and saddle-point
methods, we make a detailed assessment of the spectra obtained by modeling the attosecond pulse
train by either a monochromatic wave or a Dirac-Delta comb. These are the two extreme limits of a
real train, which is composed by a ﬁnite set of harmonics. Speciﬁcally, in the monochromatic limit,
we ﬁnd the downhill and uphill sets of orbits reported in the literature, and analyze their inﬂuence
on the high-harmonic spectra. We show that, in principle, the downhill trajectories lead to stronger
harmonics, and pronounced enhancements in the low-plateau region. These features are analyzed
in terms of quantum interference eﬀects between pairs of quantum orbits, and compared to those
obtained in the Dirac-Delta limit.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One attosecond (10−18s) is roughly the time it takes for
light to travel through atomic distances. This fact makes
high-frequency pulses of attosecond duration a very pow-
erful tool for resolving or even controlling dynamic pro-
cesses occurring at the atomic scale [1]. Indeed, in the
past few years, such pulses have caused a breakthrough in
metrology, with applications as diverse as resolving the
motion of bound electrons [2], exciting inner-shell elec-
trons [3], inducing vibrational wavepackets in molecules
[4], or controlling electron emission [5].

Attosecond pulses have been predicted theoretically in
the mid-1990s [6] and have become experimentally feasi-
ble a few years later [7, 8, 9]. They are a direct conse-
quence of the fact that high-order harmonics, generated
by the interaction of a strong laser ﬁeld (intensities of
the order of 1014W/cm2) with a gaseous sample, are al-
most phase locked [6]. Hence, by superposing sets of high
harmonics, it is possible to produce attosecond pulses.
Speciﬁcally, there exist two main scenarios: either one
obtains an attosecond-pulse train, by employing long in-
put pulses [7, 9], or isolated attosecond pulses, from few-
cycle driving ﬁelds [2, 8, 10]. Both situations have been
widely exploited in the literature, and sometimes the at-
tosecond pulses appear in combination with additional
driving ﬁelds.

For instance, recently, an attosecond-pulse train su-
perposed to a strong, infrared, linearly polarized ﬁeld
has been employed to control high-harmonic generation
(HHG) [11, 12] and above-threshold ionization (ATI)
[13]. Such a train exhibited a time-delay td with respect
to the infra-red ﬁeld. By varying this delay, one could
inﬂuence several features, such as the intensities, reso-
lutions, and maximal energies in the high-harmonic or
photoelectron spectra. This scheme has been proposed
theoretically [11, 13] and realized experimentally [12, 13],

and the key idea behind it is to provide an additional
pathway, which can be controlled, for an electronic wave
packet to be released in the continuum.

This can be understood in view of the physical
mechanisms behind both phenomena.
At a time
t′, an electron is freed by tunneling or multiphoton
ionization. Subsequently, it propagates in the continuum,
gaining energy from the ﬁeld, and it is driven back to-
wards its parent ion, to which it returns at a time t. If
the electron recombines or rescatters, there is either emis-
sion of high-frequency radiation (i.e., HHG), or of high-
energy photoelectrons (i.e., high-order ATI) [14]. For
low-order ATI peaks, the electron reaches the detector
without rescattering. An attosecond pulse train allows
the electron to reach the continuum by absorbing high-
energy photons and being able to overcome the ionization
potential. Additionally, since they are of very short du-
ration, the attosecond pulses provide a tool to control the
instant at which the electron is being ejected. This has
direct consequences in the momentum it acquires from
the ﬁeld when it is released [13], and also a strong inﬂu-
ence on the kinetic energy the electron has upon return
[11, 12]. Therefore, it also aﬀects the spectra.

The results in [11, 12] and [13] have been obtained from
the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation, and the attosecond-pulse train has been mod-
eled by the superposition of ﬁve harmonics (Ω11 = 11ω
to Ω19 = 19ω). These are realistic assumptions, and well
within the available experimental data. However, in or-
der to interpret the results obtained, the attosecond-pulse
train has been approximated by a monochromatic wave
of frequency Ω15 = 15ω, which is the central frequency of
the group of harmonics in question, and a classical model
for an electron ejected by such a wave and propagating in
a strong, low-frequency ﬁeld was constructed. These sim-
pliﬁcations have enormously facilitated the understand-
ing of the ionization mechanisms, and, speciﬁcally, have

shown how to manipulate ionization by varying the time
delay td.

In a previous publication, we have also investigated
the ATI and HHG spectra from an atom irradiated by
a time-delayed attosecond-pulse train superposed to a
near-infrared laser ﬁeld [15]. Speciﬁcally, we have con-
sidered the transition amplitudes for both phenomena
within the Strong-Field Approximation, and took the at-
tosecond pulse train to be a sum of Dirac-Delta functions
in the time domain. These assumptions have allowed an
almost entirely analytical treatment, which has been vital
for a clear understanding of the problem. Indeed, we were
able to investigate the inﬂuence of the attosecond pulses
on the spectra in far more detail than in [11, 12, 13], and
to interpret the results obtained in terms of quantum in-
terference eﬀects.

To a very large extent, our results, as well as their
physical interpretation, agree with those in [11, 12, 13].
In fact, we have obtained, for very speciﬁc time delays,
enhancements of more than one order of magnitude in
the harmonic spectra similar to those reported in [11].
Furthermore, as the time delay increases, the enhance-
ments move gradually from the high-order harmonics to-
wards lower frequencies, until they only aﬀect the low-
plateau region. Finally, for ATI, we have observed an
identical behavior of the yield with the time delay as in
[13], namely that it extends towards higher energies if
ωtd = nπ, and that it decays most quickly, as the fre-
quency increases, for ωtd = (2n + 1)π/2.

There exist, however, a few discrepancies, especially
for HHG, between our results and those in [11]. First,
the above-mentioned features occur for diﬀerent phases
φ = ωtd. Second, the explanations for such features are
slightly diﬀerent. In [15], we related the enhancements
in the spectra to a particular pair of orbits, for which
the excursion times ∆t = t − t′ of the electron in the
continuum were very short. Therefore, the spreading of
the electronic wave packet in the continuum would be
very reduced. Hence, the overlap of this wave packet,
upon return, with the bound state it left, would be con-
siderable, leading to very prominent harmonics. We have
shown that the maximal kinetic energy the electron may
have upon return, for this pair of orbits, was very much
dependent on the delay between the infra-red ﬁeld and
attosecond-pulse train, going from 1.8Up, where Up is the
In
ponderomotive energy, to vanishingly small values.
the former case, this leads to strong harmonics through-
out, whereas the latter case causes enhancements only in
low-energy regions of the spectra.

In Ref. [11], however, the modiﬁcations in the spectra
have been attributed to the selection of speciﬁc electron
trajectories, which are present in case it is released by
a high-frequency wave, and, subsequently, propagates in
a strong infra-red ﬁeld.
In comparison to the case in
which the electron is released only by the infrared ﬁeld,
there is a splitting in the electron orbits, into the so-
called ”downhill” and ”uphill” trajectories, with respect
to the eﬀective potential barrier Veﬀ = V (r) − r.E(t′)

2

at the electron start time t′, where E(t′) and V (r) de-
note the electric ﬁeld and the atomic binding potential,
respectively. The former and the latter case relate to
the situation for which the electron velocity, at t′, has
the opposite or the same direction of the ﬁeld, respec-
tively. If the time delays are appropriately chosen, one
may enhance ionization, and thus the HHG spectra, for
a particular set of orbits, or for none.

Probably, such discrepancies are rooted on the fact
that the attosecond pulse train has been modeled in dif-
ferent ways. While in [11] it has been approximated by a
monochromatic wave, in [15] we considered a Dirac-Delta
comb. In this context, one should keep in mind that a re-
alistic attosecond-pulse train possesses a broad frequency
range. Therefore, a monochromatic wave is as much as
an approximation as a Dirac-Delta comb. The main dif-
ference lies in the number of harmonics composing the
train: the former should work better if this number is
small (such as in [11]), and the latter if it is large.

In this proceeding, we present a detailed discussion of
the two limits which one may adopt, when modeling the
attosecond pulse train. We put a particular emphasis
on the consequences of taking the attosecond pulse train
to be a monochromatic wave, within the Strong-Field
Approximation, for high-order harmonic generation. In
order to make an assessment of the similarities and dif-
ferences from the Dirac Delta comb employed in our pre-
vious work [15], we will also brieﬂy recall such results.
II,
This manuscript is organized as follows: In Sec.
we present the explicit expressions for the transition am-
plitudes, if the attosecond pulse train is taken to be a
monochromatic wave (Sec. II A) or a Dirac Delta comb
In particular, we discuss how the saddle-
(Sec.
point equations are modiﬁed for each case, and relate
their solutions to the classical orbits of an electron in a
ﬁeld. Subsequently, in Sec. III, we compute such orbits
explicitly, and employ them to calculate high-harmonic
spectra. Finally, in Sec. IV we conclude the paper, re-
lating both limits to the results in [11].

where A(t), Ω, k and Ip denote the vector potential, the
harmonic frequency, the intermediate momentum of the
freed electron and the atomic ionization potential, respec-
tively [16]. Eq. (1) describes a physical process in which

an electron is freed at a time t′, propagates in the con-
tinuum with momentum k from t′ to t, and, at this time,
recombines with its parent ion, generating a harmonic of
frequency Ω. The prefactors

where |ψ0i and E(t′) = −dA(t′)/dt′ denote the electronic
bound state and the electric ﬁeld at the time the electron
is released, respectively, contain all the inﬂuence of the
atomic binding potential, which is implicit in the bound-
state wave functions. In general, the vector potential is
given by A(t) = Al(t)+Ah(t), and the total electric ﬁeld
by E(t) = El(t) + Eh(t), where the indices l and h refer
to the laser ﬁeld and the attosecond pulses, respectively.
In this paper, we work within the so-called “broad gaus-
sian limit”, which implies that the electron is bound, and
returns to, a bound state localized at the origin of the co-
ordinate system [16]. This yields constant prefactors (3)
and (4).

For low enough frequencies and high enough laser in-
tensities, Eq. (1) can be solved to a good approximation
by the steepest descent method. Thus, we must deter-
mine k, t′ and t so that S(t, t′, Ω, k) is stationary, i.e., so
that its partial derivatives with respect to these param-
eters vanish. Apart from considerably simplifying the
computations involved, this approximation has the ad-
vantage of providing a clear space-time picture for the
physical process in question, and allowing a detailed as-
sessment of quantum-interference eﬀects. Furthermore,
as it will be shown below, the saddle-point equations can
be related to those describing the classical orbits of an
electron [17].

If the attosecond pulses are absent, the saddle-point

equations read

which the kinetic energy of the electron upon return is
converted into a photon of frequency Ω. Near the cutoﬀ,
whose energy position corresponds to the maximal value
this quantity may take, such a process has no classical
counterpart, and the transition probability is expected
to decay exponentially.

We will now include the attosecond-pulse train. The
strong, low-frequency ﬁeld will be approximated by a lin-
early polarized monochromatic wave of amplitude E0,
i.e.,

(3)

El(t) = E0 sin (ωt) ǫx,

(9)

of amplitude Eh. Eq. (9) is a sum over several odd high-
order harmonics, which are phase-locked and exhibit a
time delay td with respect to the background ﬁeld. The
indices 2k0 + 1 and 2k1 + 1 yield the minimal and the
maximal harmonic order, respectively. The function σ(t)
denotes the train temporal envelope, which will be taken
as σ = const. Physically, this corresponds to an inﬁnitely
long attosecond-pulse train.

In our model, we assume that the attosecond pulses
will mainly inﬂuence the electron ejection in the con-
tinuum but not its subsequent propagation. This latter
step will be governed by the low-frequency ﬁeld. For this
reason, unless stated otherwise, we will use the approx-
imation E(t′) ≃ Eh(t′) in the prefactor of Eq. (1), but
not in the action. This implies that the vector potential
is approximated by A(t) ≃ Al(t).

A. The monochromatic limit

For a ﬁnite number of harmonics, this yields highly
oscillating prefactors, which are no longer slowly varying.
Hence, they must be incorporated in the action. The

ing the condition for the electron to return. The ﬁrst
equation expresses tunneling ionization at t′, and has no
real solution. Physically, this means that tunneling has
no classical counterpart.
In the limit of Ip → 0, this
equation describes a classical electron being released with
vanishing drift velocity. Eq. (6) illustrates a process in

In Eq. (10), we will deﬁne a modiﬁed action,

(12)

This leads to changes in the saddle-point equation (5),
which now reads

[k + Al(t

)]2 = 2(∓qω − Ip).

(13)

Thereby, the solution in −qω does not make physically
sense, and thus will not be taken into account, whereas
that in +qω describes an ionization process in which an
electron is ejected by the absorption of a high-frequency
photon. Hence, the attosecond-pulse train, in which a
superposition of such processes occurs, provides an alter-
native pathway for the electron to reach the continuum.
This is in agreement with the discussions in [11]. We will
consider here the limit for which the attosecond pulse
train is described by a monochromatic wave, so that the
sum in (10) is dropped.

If Eq. (13) is combined with (6) and (7), one obtains

the expressions

= ω(ǫ1 arccos α − t)(cos ωt − γ2),

with α = cos ωt + γ1 − γ2, and ǫi = ±1 (i = 1, 2), for
the electron ionization and return times, respectively.
Hence, the problem of ﬁnding the pairs of times (t, t′)
has been reduced to solving the transcendental equation
(15). In the above-stated equations, one may identify the
parameters

In particular γ2 is very important for determining the
initial conditions for the electron when it is being ejected
in the continuum.

One should note that there exist sign ambiguities in the
above-stated equations. Furthermore, additional com-
plications may be caused by the fact that arccos α =
arccos(2nπ − α). We will discuss such problems explicitly
in Sec. III A, in which they are overcome by means of
physical arguments.

B. The Dirac-Delta limit

In the limit k1 − k0 −→ ∞, which is the main assump-

tion in our former work [15], Eq. (9) reads

Eh(t) =

In this case, the ionization time is being ﬁxed at t′
n =

that the electron is no longer reaching the continuum
through tunneling ionization, but is being released by the
attosecond pulses. However, in contrast to the approxi-
mation in the previous section, all information about the

deed, the electron is reaching the continuum with any of
the energies N ω − Ip, since all harmonics composing the
train are equivalent.

Under these assumptions, the transition amplitude is
further simpliﬁed so that only the integrals in the in-
termediate electron momentum k and the return time t
must be solved. In this case, the saddle-point equations
(6) and (7) can be combined in order to obtain the tran-
scendental equation

Similarly to the
monochromatic-limit case, one may identify ambiguities
in Eq. (19). It turned out, however, that they are fewer
and far easier to overcome in the limit discussed in this
Section.

III. RESULTS

A. Start and return times

We will now assess the inﬂuence of the additional
attosecond-pulse train on the electron orbits. As a start-
ing point, we will approximate it by a high-frequency
monochromatic wave. In general, we will refer to a pair
of orbits employing the indices (i, j), which increase with
the electron excursion times ∆t = t−t′ in the continuum.
We will initially concentrate on the shortest pair of or-
bits, i.e., (1, 2), which provide the most prominent con-
tributions to the high-harmonic spectra. In Fig. 1, we
display the real parts of the ionization and return times
for such orbits, obtained from the saddle point equations
(13), (6) and (7), as compared to the situation for which
the attosecond pulses are absent (i.e., for q = 0 in (13)).
In all cases, start and return times occur in pairs, which
coalesce at well-deﬁned energies. Such energies corre-
spond to the maximal kinetic energy with which a clas-
sical electron may return to its parent ion. For higher
energies, the transition amplitudes are exponentially de-
caying. Hence, potentially, such energies lead to cutoﬀs
in the spectra. For a monochromatic ﬁeld in the ab-
sence of the attosecond-pulse train, the cutoﬀ occurs at
3.17Up + Ip.

In the ﬁgure, we can identify two main distinct regimes.
If the frequency Ωq = qω is lower than the ionization po-
tential Ip, qualitatively, there is the same behavior for
the start times t′ or return times t. Indeed, the only dif-
ference is the cutoﬀ energy, which is slightly lower. An

monochromatic wave of frequency Ωq = qω. For compar-
ison, we also provide such times for the case in which the
attosecond train is absent (q = 0 in Eq.(13)). The atomic
system is taken to be argon (Ip = 0.58 a.u.) and we only
show the harmonic orders for which Ω > Ip. The dashed and

(14) and (15) supports this inter-
inspection of Eqs.
pretation:
if qω − Ip < 0, the parameter γ2 is purely
imaginary, so that the solutions of (15) occur in conju-
gate pairs. The element of such a pair which leads to
Im[t′] < 0 is discarded as unphysical, whereas the other
element is directly associated with the tunneling process.
In this context, the quantity Im[t′] provides information
about how probable the tunneling process is, as it will be
discussed below.

If on the other hand, qω − Ip > 0 (for instance, for
q = 15), the attosecond pulses have given enough en-
ergy for the electron to overcome the potential barrier.
In this case, it is reaching the continuum with veloc-
2(qω − Ip). In comparison to a situation for

locity, which is the classical limit of Eq. (5), there is a
splitting in the ionization times t′ for each set of orbits.
This is precisely the eﬀect reported in Ref. [11], and can
be readily understood from Eq. (15), in which now the
parameter γ2 is real. Hence, there exist now two solutions
of (15) which make physically sense. The solution with
γ2 < 0 yields the downhill trajectories in [11], whereas
that with γ2 > 0 corresponds to the uphill trajectories.

Interestingly, however, for both types of trajectories,
the electron returns almost at the same time t. In fact,
there are only noticeable diﬀerences near the ionization
threshold Ω = 10ω, which, at most, will inﬂuence the
low-plateau region. Hence, the electron excursion times
in the continuum are considerably shorter for γ2 < 0.
Obviously, the larger the frequency Ωq = qω, the more
pronounced the splitting is.
In comparison with [11],
however, there is a much larger overlap of the start times
for both types of trajectories near the ionization thresh-
old.

From a more technical viewpoint, it is worth mention-
ing that, in the computation of the orbits (1, 2), we have
taken ǫ1 = ǫ2 = +1 and γ1 < 0 in general. As an ex-
ception, for q = 15, γ2 < 0, and i = 1, for harmonic
frequencies Ω/ω ≤ 24.4 one must employ an analytical
continuation in Eq. (15), with ǫ2 = −1, ǫ1 = +1 and
2π − arccos α instead of arccos α, in order to guarantee
continuous solutions.

The above-stated physical interpretation is conﬁrmed
by Fig. 2, in which the imaginary parts of the start
times are depicted. Such imaginary parts are in a sense
a measurement of a quantum-mechanical process having

for the pairs of orbits (3, 4) [panels (a) and (b)], and (5, 6)
[panels (c) and (d)], as functions of the high-harmonic order,
for the same atomic and ﬁeld parameters as in the previous
ﬁgures. The orbits (3, 4) have been obtained by taking ǫ1 =
ǫ2 = +1 and γ1 > 0 in Eq.
(15), while (5, 6) have been

monochromatic and q = 9 cases, |Im[t′]| 6= 0. This is ex-
pected, since tunneling ionization has no classical coun-
terpart. Furthermore, |Im[t′]| decreases if the attosecond
pulses are present, due to an eﬀectively narrower barrier.
In case the electron is able to overcome the atomic bind-
ing potential (e.g., for q = 15), for energies lower than
the cutoﬀ, |Im[t′]| is vanishingly small, since now a clas-
sical counterpart does exist. Clearly, beyond the cutoﬀ
energy, the imaginary parts of such times increase.

The splitting in the electron start times is not exclusive
of (1, 2), but, in fact, occurs for all pairs of orbits. As
concrete examples, in Fig. 3 we illustrate the real parts
of the start and return times for the orbits (3, 4) and
(5, 6). Such orbits correspond to electron excursion times
∆t ∼ 1.5T and ∆t ∼ 2T, respectively, where T = 2π/ω
denotes a cycle of the driving ﬁeld. Clearly, the start
times t′ split for qω − Ip > 0, due to the electron non-
vanishing velocity upon ejection. Once more, each pair
of start times leads to a shorter and a longer set of orbits,
which correspond to γ2 < 0 or γ2 > 0, respectively. The
corresponding electron start times do not overlap in any
energy region. This is due to the fact that they are much
more localized than for the orbits (1, 2).

For comparison, in Fig. 3, we present the solutions
of Eq. (19), obtained when the attosecond-pulses are ap-

I = 5 × 1014W/cm2, and frequency ω = 0.057 a.u. and an
attosecond-pulse train of intensity Ih = 1013W/cm2, com-
posed of an inﬁnite number of harmonics (Eq. (17)). Parts
(a), (b), (c) and (d) correspond to delays φ = 0, φ = 0.25π,
φ = 0.5π and φ = 0.75π between the attosecond-pulse train
and the low-frequency driving wave, respectively. In the ﬁg-
ure, we only show the harmonic orders for which Ω > Ip, and
the pairs of orbits are indicated by the natural numbers (i, j),
which increase according to the electron excursion time in the
continuum. The ionization times are indicated by the blue

proximated by a sum of Dirac-Delta functions, for several
time delays. The start and return times, as well as the
cutoﬀ energies, are diﬀerent from those in the previous
ﬁgures. Indeed, we no longer observe a splitting in the
sets of ionization and recombination times, as compared
to the situation for which the attosecond pulses are ab-
sent. This is in perfect agreement with the fact that now
there is no longer a well-deﬁned velocity with which the
electron is being ejected. In contrast, however, there is
now a single ionization time per half cycle, determined
by Eq. (17). The return times, however, still occur in
pairs that coalesce at the cutoﬀs. For each pair of or-
bits, the cutoﬀ energies, as well as the excursion times,
considerably changes with the time delay td.

B. Harmonic spectra

We will now analyze the spectra computed under the

assumptions in Sec.
pulse train can be approximated by a high-frequency,
monochromatic wave. For comparison, we will also
present spectra computed considering that the APT is

II A,

a sequence of Dirac-Delta functions. In this latter case,
however, we will keep the discussion as brief as possible,
as a detailed analysis is already presented in [15]. In both
cases, we have employed a uniform saddle-point approx-
imation in order to compute the transition amplitudes.
This approximation is discussed in detail in [19].

If one concentrates on the physical picture of down-
hill and uphill trajectories, a very important question is
the inﬂuence of each type of orbit in the high-harmonic
spectra, and how such trajectories can be selected.
In
[11], such a selection has been performed by employing
an appropriate time-delay td between the strong, infra-
red ﬁeld and the attosecond-pulse train. In our frame-
work, however, since we are approximating the train by a
monochromatic wave, all information about this param-
eter is lost. However, we can mimic the eﬀect achieved
in [11] by leaving out, or including, the corresponding
orbits in our computations.

In Fig. 5.(a), we present the spectra computed for a
train with the frequency Ω15 = 15ω employing all orbits
up to (5, 6). In this case, qω −Ip > 0, so that the electron
is being ejected with non-vanishing drift velocity and the
spectra contains contributions from both the uphill and
the downhill trajectories. We have restricted the electron
start times to the ﬁrst half cycle of the laser ﬁeld, so that
there are no sharp harmonics in the ﬁgure. One is able to
view, however, the structures caused by the interference
between the diﬀerent pairs of trajectories very clearly.
Prominent features are also a cutoﬀ near harmonic order
N = 57. This is in agreement with Fig. 1, which shows
that the pairs of orbits (1,2) coalesce around this energy,
and also with Fig. 2, for which there is a sharp increase
in |Im[t′]| at this harmonic order. Furthermore, there is
a very pronounced hump in the low-plateau region.

More detail is provided in Fig. 5.(b), in which the indi-
vidual contributions from the downhill (γ2 < 0) and the
uphill (γ2 > 0) trajectories are displayed. In general, the
former contributions are at least half an order of magni-
tude larger than the latter. This is expected, since, for
γ2 < 0, the electron excursion times in the continuum
are shorter for all sets of orbits. This means that there
is less spreading for the electronic wave packet, and con-
sequently a larger overlap, upon return, between such a
wave packet and the atomic bound state with which it
recombines. Obviously, this leads to a larger harmonic
yield. Furthermore, in both cases there is no diﬀerence
in the cutoﬀ energy. This is due to the fact that all tra-
jectories split symmetrically, with respect to the purely
monochromatic case.

The above-stated features can be understood in detail
analyzing the contributions from each pair of orbits. Such
contributions are displayed in Fig. 6. For both cases, the
main features in the spectra, such as their overall inten-
sities, the plateau shapes and cutoﬀ energies, are deter-
mined by the orbits (1, 2). In fact, the contributions from
such orbits are at least one order of magnitude larger
than those from (3, 4) or (5, 6). This is in particular true
for the case γ2 < 0, due to the shorter excursion times.

Harmonic Order N

FIG. 5: Harmonic spectra computed with the orbits (1, 2),
(3, 4) and (5, 6), for an attosecond-pulse train of frequency
Ω15 = 15ω superposed to a strong, near-infrared ﬁeld of fre-
quency ω = 0.057 a.u. The ﬁeld and atomic parameters are
the same as in Fig. 1. Panel (a) exhibits the contributions
from all sets of orbits, while panel (b) displays the individ-
ual contributions from the orbits with γ2 > 0 or γ2 < 0 in
Eq. (15). The numbers on the upper edge of the ﬁgure give
the kinetic energy of the electron upon return, in units of the
ponderomotive energy Up.

Apart from that, they coalesce at a much larger energy
than the other sets. This means that, classically, the
maximal energy for which the electron returns to its par-
ent ion along (1, 2), and consequently the cutoﬀ, is larger
than for the longer orbits. In the ﬁgure, we also notice
that the hump in the low-plateau region, for γ2 < 0,
can be traced back to the fact that the electron excur-
sion time in the continuum, for the set (1, 2) is extremely
short in this case (see, e.g., Fig. 1). The other pairs of
orbits mainly contribute to the substructure in the spec-
tra. Another noteworthy feature is that, regardless of the
sign of γ2, the cutoﬀ energies are the same for all sets of
orbits, in agreement with the previous discussion.

Another scenario, presented in Fig. 7 for comparison,
is observed if the attosecond-pulse train is taken to be
a Dirac-Delta comb.
In this case, the dominant set of
orbits, and, consequently, the shape of the spectra, are

FIG. 6: Individual contributions from the shortest three pairs
of orbits to the high-harmonic spectra, for the same ﬁeld and
atomic parameters as in the previous ﬁgure. Panel (a) and
(b) depicts the contributions from γ2 > 0 or γ2 < 0 in Eq.

highly dependent on the time delay td. For instance, if
the time delay is vanishing [Fig. 7.(a)], the spectrum is
dominated by the orbits (1, 2). This is due to the fact
that they coalesce at the energy Ip + 1.8Up, which is at
a relatively high harmonic order. Furthermore, since the
electron excursion times are very short, the harmonics are
quite prominent. For φ = ωtd = 0.25π [Fig. 7.(b)], there
is now a double plateau, with two consecutive intensity
drops at Ip + 0.93Up and Ip + 2.11Up. These are the
energies for which the orbits (1, 2) and (3, 4) coalesce,
respectively. Speciﬁcally in the upper half of the plateau,
there was a drop in one order of magnitude, as compared
to Fig. 7.(a). This is due to the larger excursion times,
and, consequently, wave-packet spreading, for (3, 4). If
the delay increases further [Fig. 7.(c)], the contributions
from (1, 2) only cause a shoulder in the spectrum, due to
the fact that they now coalesce at Ip + 0.26Up, and the
plateau, extending until Ip + 2.5Up, is determined by the

and external-ﬁeld parameters in Fig. 4, and delays φ =
0, φ = 0.25π, φ = 0.5π and φ = 0.75π between the
attosecond-pulse train and the low-frequency driving wave
(Figs. 7(a), 7.(b), 7.(c) and 7.(d), respectively).
In the ﬁg-
ure, we only show the harmonic orders for which Ω > Ip. The
contributions from speciﬁc pairs of orbits are depicted in the
same colors as those employed in Fig. 4, for depicting each
corresponding pair. For comparison, the spectra computed
with the ten shortest orbits and with orbit 3 to 10 are given

orbits (3, 4). The latter orbits dominate the spectra even
more for φ = ωtd = 0.75π [Fig. 7.(d)], since the cutoﬀ
energy for (1, 2) is now vanishingly small. This eﬀect
is very similar to that observed in [11], even though it
occurs for completely diﬀerent delays.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The outcome of this work supports the results in [11] in
several ways. In general, it also shows that, by changing
the initial conditions with which an electron is ejected
in the continuum, one may manipulate several features
in the spectra, such as the high-harmonic intensities, or
cutoﬀ. Furthermore, by considering the electron to be
released in the continuum by a monochromatic wave, we
have obtained a splitting of the electron start times very
similar to that reported in [11], within the context of the
Strong-Field Approximation, in the so-called uphill and
downhill trajectories.

We have also observed enhancements in the low-
plateau region, and higher overall intensities for the con-
tributions from the downhill trajectories. This indicates

a good perspective for harmonic control, by selecting ei-
ther the downhill or uphill trajectories with, for instance,
an adequate delay between the infrared ﬁeld and the
attosecond-pulse train.

We have also obtained very detailed information about
the contributions of speciﬁc pairs of orbits to the spectra.
In the monochromatic limit, the shortest pair of trajecto-
ries, denoted (1, 2) is completely dominant, determining
the shape of the plateau, the cutoﬀ energy and the over-
all intensity in the spectra. This is due to the fact that
the maximal classical energy for this pair, and thus the
cutoﬀ, is always at a higher harmonic order than for the
longer pairs of trajectories.

In contrast, in case one considers a sum of Dirac-Delta
functions, the dominance of this pair will depend very
much on the time delay between the infra-red ﬁeld and
the attosecond pulses. This is due to the fact that the
maximal energy an electron returning along these orbits
is not always at a higher harmonic frequency than for
the longer pairs. For instance, if for ωtd = 0, the or-
bits (1,2) coalesce at the end of the plateau, and thus
overshadow the remaining contributions, for ωtd = 0.25π
and ωtd = 0.5π, this energy lies at the low-energy part of
the plateau, or near the ionization potential, respectively.
Hence, the orbits (3,4) will also play an important role
in the spectra.

A feature in common for both the monochromatic
and the Dirac-Delta limits is that the excursion time
∆t = t − t′ of the electron in the continuum is a very im-
portant parameter, and considerably inﬂuences the shape
of the plateau and harmonic intensities. This is not sur-
prising, since, now, for all sets of orbits, the electron is
reaching the continuum with a roughly equal, and large,
probability. Hence, the diﬀerences in the yield will be
mainly determined by the overlap between the returning
electronic wave packet and the bound state with which it
recombines. The shorter the orbit along which the elec-
In
tron is returning is, the larger this overlap will be.
contrast, if the electron is released by tunneling ioniza-

9

tion, the probability with which it is ejected will depend
much more critically on the instantaneous potential bar-
rier, and also inﬂuence the yield.

Moreover, it is remarkable that both asymptotic limits
exhibit features in common with those obtained in [11]
within a more realistic model for the attosecond pulses.
The monochromatic limit, for instance, allows one to
identify the downhill and uphill trajectories, and to an-
alyze their consequences in the spectra. Approximating
the attosecond pulse train by a sum of Dirac Delta func-
tions, on the other hand, sheds light on several features
reported in [11], such as a double plateau, or changes of
more than one order of magnitude in the harmonic spec-
tra. However, only in Delta-Dirac case there is a decrease
in the energy of the enhanced harmonics, with increasing
time delays td.

There exist, however, aspects of [11] that we have not
addressed. We have not, for instance, investigated the
diﬀerences in the high-harmonic resolution, due to a par-

would have been necessary to extend the start times to
several cycles of the laser ﬁeld.
Instead, we have re-
stricted them only to the ﬁrst half cycle, in order to have
a closer look at quantum interference eﬀects. Further-
more, the uniform approximation employed in this work
requires that we deal with pairs of trajectories (for de-
tails see [19]), and such eﬀects are expected to be related
to single trajectories in a pair [6]. These issues were not
the main objective of this work, and are open for further
studies.

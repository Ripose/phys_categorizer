A many-body theory approach is developed for the problem of positron-atom scattering and
annihilation. Strong electron-positron correlations are included non-perturbatively through the
calculation of the electron-positron vertex function. It corresponds to the sum of an inﬁnite series
of ladder diagrams, and describes the physical eﬀect of virtual positronium formation. The vertex
function is used to calculate the positron-atom correlation potential and nonlocal corrections to the
electron-positron annihilation vertex. Numerically, we make use of B-spline basis sets, which ensures
rapid convergence of the sums over intermediate states. We have also devised an extrapolation
procedure that allows one to achieve convergence with respect to the number of intermediate-state
orbital angular momenta included in the calculations. As a test, the present formalism is applied to
positron scattering and annihilation on hydrogen, where it is exact. Our results agree with those of
accurate variational calculations. We also examine in detail the properties of the large correlation
corrections to the annihilation vertex.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of a low-energy positron with a many-electron atom is characterised by strong correlation eﬀects.
Apart from the dynamic polarisation of the electron cloud by the ﬁeld of the positron, the positron can also form
positronium (Ps), by picking up one of the atomic electrons. When the positron energy is below the Ps-formation
threshold, εPs = I + E1s(Ps) = I − 6.8 eV, where I is the atomic ionisation potential, positronium formation is a
virtual process. Nevertheless, its role in the positron-atom interaction is very important [1, 2, 3, 4]. The main aim of
this work is to develop a many-body theory approach which accounts accurately for both correlation eﬀects, and to
test it for positron scattering and annihilation on hydrogen.

The study of positron interaction with matter is a topic of fundamental interest [5]. Positrons have also found
many useful applications. They are a very sensitive probe of the presence of defects in materials [6]. The recent
development of a scanning positron microscope [7] may lead to an increased use of positrons for quality control
of materials, particularly in the semiconductor industry. In medicine, positron emission tomography, or PET, has
become a standard means of medical imaging (see, e.g., [8]). A proper understanding of how positrons interact with
matter at the fundamental level of atoms and molecules, is therefore essential.

The interaction of low-energy positrons with atoms has presented a challenge to the theorist for many decades.
The study of positron scattering from atoms was initially seen as a useful complement to work on electron scattering,
particularly in helping to understand the role of the exchange interaction. However, although the exchange interaction
is absent, it was quickly realised that the positron-atom problem is more complex than the electron case. The attractive
induced polarisation potential tends to cancel and even overcome the static repulsion of the positron by the atom
at low energies. The positron may also temporarily capture one of the atomic electrons in a process known as
virtual positronium formation. The need to account for these eﬀects requires an elaborate and accurate theoretical
description.

For small systems, such as hydrogen and helium, accurate results were obtained through the use of variational
methods [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Positron scattering from alkali atoms which have a single valence electron, has
been calculated extensively using a coupled-channel method with pseudostates [15]. More recently, positron and Ps
interaction with atoms with few active (valence) electrons has been studied using the stochastic variational method
(SVM) and conﬁguration-interaction-type approaches [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. However, it is diﬃcult to extend these
methods to larger atomic systems with many valence electrons, e.g., the noble gases.

An attractive alternative to few-body methods is many-body theory [21].

It lends itself naturally to the study
of problems where an extra particle interacts with a closed-shell target. The use of diagrams makes this method

both descriptive and intuitive, and allows one to take many-particle correlations into account in a systematic way.
Many-body theory has been successful in the study of photoionisation [22], and in problems involving electrons, such
as electron-atom scattering [23, 24, 25, 26], negative ions [27, 28, 29, 30], and precise calculations of energies and
transition amplitudes in heavy atoms with a single valence electron [31, 32]. The application of many-body theory to
low-energy positron interactions with atoms has met with more diﬃculty.

Many-body theory utilises techniques originating in quantum ﬁeld theory. It describes the terms of the perturbation
series in the interaction between particles diagrammatically. The diﬃculty in applying this approach to the interaction
of positrons with atoms arises from the need to take into account (virtual) Ps formation. Being a bound state, Ps
cannot be described by a ﬁnite number of perturbation-theory terms. Hence, an inﬁnite sequence of the ‘ladder’
diagrams must be summed.

The ﬁrst attempt to apply many-body theory to the positron-atom problem was by Amusia et al in 1976 [2],
who used a crude approximate method of accounting for virtual Ps formation in He. A better approximation for
the virtual Ps-formation contribution was devised in [4], and applications to various atomic targets, including noble
gases, were reported [33, 34, 35]. In particular, a reasonable description was obtained for positron scattering from
noble-gas atoms, which highlighted the presence of positron-atom virtual levels in Ar, Kr and Xe. On the other hand,
application of the same approximation to positron-atom annihilation showed that it was clearly deﬁcient.

In spite of the approximate treatment of virtual Ps formation, many-body theory calculations for Mg, Cd, Zn
and Hg were the ﬁrst to provide credible evidence that positrons can bind to neutral atoms [33]. Two years later
positron-atom binding was proved in a stochastic variational calculation for Li [36]. At present the list of atoms
capable of binding positrons has expanded dramatically, SVM and conﬁguration-interaction calculations conﬁrming
positron binding to Mg, Cd and Zn [37, 38]. This topic is now of major interest in positron physics (see [38, 39] for
useful reviews).

In this paper, new techniques will be outlined that allow the exact calculation of the electron-positron ladder
diagram sequence which accounts for virtual Ps formation. This approach enables many-body theory to provide
accurate information on the elastic scattering, annihilation and binding of positrons on atoms and negative ions at
energies below the Ps formation threshold.

II. MANY-BODY THEORY METHOD

A. Dyson equation

A conventional treatment of positron scattering from an N -electron target would start from the Schr¨odinger equation
for the total wavefunction for the N + 1 particles. In many-body theory we start instead from the Dyson equation
(see, e.g., [21, 40]),

(H0 + Σε)ψε = εψε,

where ψε is the single-particle (quasi-particle) wavefunction of the positron, ε is its energy, and H0 is a central-ﬁeld
Hamiltonian of the zeroth approximation, which describes the motion of the positron in the static ﬁeld of the target.
The many-body dynamics in Eq. (1) is represented by Σε, a nonlocal energy-dependent correlation potential. This
quantity, also known as the optical potential, is equal to the self-energy part of the single-particle Green’s function of
the positron in the presence of the atom [41]. Due to its nonlocal nature Σε operates on the quasi-particle wavefunction
as an integral operator,

Σεψε =

Σε(r, r′)ψε(r′)dr′.

Z

For hydrogen H0 may simply be taken as the Hamiltonian of the positron moving in the electrostatic ﬁeld of the
2 ∇2 + U (r), where U (r) = (1 + r−1)e−2r [42] (we use atomic units throughout). For
ground-state atom, H0 = − 1
systems containing more than one electron the Hartree-Fock (HF) Hamiltonian (without exchange, for the positron)
is the best choice. The correlation potential Σε is given by an inﬁnite perturbation series in powers of the residual
electron-electron and electron-positron interaction.
Inclusion of the electrostatic interaction in H0 and the use of
the HF approximation for the target electrons means that the perturbation-theory expansion for Σε starts with the
2nd-order diagrams, and that the diagrams do not contain elements which describe the electrostatic potential [43].

Owing to the spherical symmetry of the problem, Eq. (1) can be solved separately for each positron partial wave.
So, in practice one deals with radial quasiparticle wavefunctions, ˜Pεl(r), related to ψε by ψε(r) = r−1 ˜Pεl(r)Ylm(Ω),
where Ylm(Ω) is the spherical harmonic for the orbital angular momentum l. Accordingly, the self-energy operator is
also found for each partial wave separately, as Σ(l)

ε (r, r′), see Eq. (A1) in the Appendix.

Figure 1 shows the lowest-order terms of the diagrammatic expansion for the correlation potential Σ, or more
precisely, for the matrix element hε′|ΣE|εi of the correlation potential calculated at some energy E between the
positron states ε and ε′. The leading 2nd-order diagram, (a) in Fig. 1, corresponds to the following expression,

electron states µ and hole states n, and i0 is an inﬁnitesimal positive imaginary quantity.

FIG. 1: Diagrammatic expansion of the positron-atom correlation potential Σ. Shown are the 2nd-order and main 3rd-order
contributions. The top line in all the diagrams corresponds to the positron. Other lines with the arrows to the right describe
excited electron states, while those with the arrows to the left correspond to holes, i.e., the electron states occupied in the atomic
ground state. Wavy lines are the electron-positron or electron-electron Coulomb interactions.

It is easy to see from Eq. (3) that at low energies E the diagonal matrix element hε|Σ(2)

E |εi is negative. This means
that the 2nd-order contribution to the correlation potential, Fig. 1(a), describes attraction. In fact, this diagram
accounts for the main correlation eﬀect in low-energy scattering, namely the polarisation of the atom by the charged
projectile. At large distances it leads to a well-known local polarisation potential,

where α is the static dipole polarisability of the atom in the HF approximation,

Besides the 2nd-order diagram, Fig. 1 shows the main 3rd-order contributions. A complete list of 3rd-order diagrams
includes mirror images of the diagrams (f) and (g). There are also a few more diagrams similar to diagram (h), where
the positron line is connected to the atomic excitation part by a single line. They represent correlation corrections to
the HF electron charge density of the ground-state atom. Such corrections are much smaller than other correlations
eﬀects [32], and can be neglected. The total number of the 3rd-order diagrams in the positron-atom problem is
considerably smaller than that in the electron case (see, e.g., [32]), where one needs to allow for the exchange between
the incident and core electrons.

Comparing diagrams (c), (e), (f) and (g) with (a) in Fig. 1, we see that they represent corrections to the leading
polarisation diagram, Σ(2), due to electron correlations within the atom. Interaction between electron-hole pairs can
in principle be included in all orders, which would correspond to the random phase approximation (RPA) treatment
of atomic polarisation [44]. On the other hand, if the two hole orbitals in diagrams (c) and (e) are identical, these
diagrams together with similar higher-order terms, are easily incorporated within the 2nd-order diagram by calculating

the excited electron states µ in the ﬁeld of the atom with a hole in this orbital [24]. These approximations, and even
the “bare” 2nd-order approximation (with exchange diagrams added in both cases), give good results in electron-atom
scattering and negative ion problems [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].

However, for the positron-atom problem the approximation based on diagrams (a) and corrections of types (c), (e),
(f), and (g), proved to be deﬁcient [2, 3, 4]. In addition one must include the diagram Fig. 1 (b) and higher-order
diagrams in which the positron interacts with the excited electron in the intermediate state, Fig. 2. This sequence
of diagrams accounts for virtual Ps formation. It is important that it is summed to all orders, since in quantum
mechanics a bound state (here, Ps) which is absent in the zeroth approximation cannot be described by a ﬁnite
number of perturbation theory terms.

FIG. 3: Electron-positron ladder diagram sequence and its sum, the vertex function Γ.

Comparing the left- and right-hand sides of the diagrammatic equation in Fig. 3, we see that the vertex function

satisﬁes the following linear equation,

hν2µ2|ΓE|µ1ν1i = hν2µ2|V |µ1ν1i +

hν2µ2|V |µνihνµ|ΓE|µ1ν1i
E − εν − εµ + i0

.

Xν, µ

The vertex function depends on the energy E. It has the meaning of the electron-positron scattering amplitude in
the ﬁeld of the atom. In the lowest-order approximation ΓE = V .

Once the vertex function is found, the contribution of virtual Ps to the correlation potential, Fig. 2, is obtained as

hε′|Σ(Γ)

E |εi =

Xνi, µi, n

hε′n|V |µ2ν2ihν2µ2|ΓE+εn |µ1ν1ihν1µ1|V |nεi
(E − εν2 − εµ2 + εn + i0)(E − εν1 − εµ1 + εn + i0)

.

Since the electron-positron Coulomb interaction is attractive, V < 0, the terms of the perturbation series in Fig. 3
have the same sign. This explains why their sum, and hence, the contribution of virtual Ps formation to the positron-
atom attraction, are large. Note that for electron scattering (V > 0) this series is alternating. As a result the net
contribution of the diagrammatic series on the left-hand side in Fig. 2 is small, and its omission in the electron-atom
correlation potential does not give rise to large errors.

The Ps-formation contribution to the correlation potential was previously approximated by using the free 1s-state

Ps propagator orthogonalised to the ground-state electron wavefunctions [4, 34],

approximation is suitable for positron scattering from the targets where ground-state Ps formation dominates, e.g.,
hydrogen or noble gas atoms. It also allows one to consider positron scattering above the Ps-formation threshold,
where the correlation potential acquires an imaginary part due to the pole in the integral in Eq. (8) [35, 45]. At the
same time, the ground-state Ps propagator fails to describe the short-range electron-positron correlations crucial for
the calculation of the annihilation rates [34]. By the uncertainty principle, small separations invoke contributions of
highly excited states of the Ps internal motion, not included in the Ps(1s) propagator. In contrast, our present method
based on the summation of the ladder diagram series, Eqs. (6) and (7), is consistent and complete. It accounts for
all (virtual) intermediate states of the electron-positron pair.

For positron scattering on hydrogen, only a few types of diagrams contribute to ΣE, since only one hole can be
created. Moreover, the interaction of the intermediate-state electron and positron with the hole [diagrams (c) and
(d) in Fig. 1] can be taken into account by calculating the intermediate electron and positron wavefunctions in the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus. In this case, the correlation potential is given by the sum of the 2nd-order diagram and
the virtual Ps contribution, Figs. 1(a) and 2, and

is the exact correlation potential. In particular, the long-range asymptotic behaviour of Σ(2)
contains the exact polarisability of hydrogen, α = 9

Rather than solving the Dyson equation for the quasiparticle wavefunction in the coordinate representation, it is

easier to work with the self-energy matrix,

H0ϕε = εϕε,

with a given angular momentum l, ϕε(r) = r−1Pεl(r)Ylm(Ω). Since the static potential of the atom is repulsive, all
positron states ϕε lie in the continuum (ε > 0). The radial wavefunctions are normalised to a δ-function of energy in
Rydberg, δ(k2 − k′2), where k is the positron momentum. This corresponds to the asymptotic behaviour

The matrix (10) can be used to obtain the phaseshifts directly [25]. First, a ‘reducible’ self-energy matrix hε′| ˜ΣE|εi

is found via the integral equation,

D. Positron annihilation

λ = πr2

0cnZeﬀ,

The annihilation rate λ, of a positron in a gas of number density n is usually expressed in terms of the eﬀective

number of electrons, Zeﬀ, which contribute to annihilation on an atom or molecule [46],

where r0 is the classical electron radius and c is the speed of light. Equation (19) deﬁnes Zeﬀ as the ratio of the
positron two-photon annihilation cross section of the atom to the spin-averaged two-photon annihilation cross section
of a free electron in the Born approximation [47]. Annihilation takes place at very small electron-positron separations,
¯h/(mc) ∼ 10−2 a.u. Hence, for nonrelativistic positrons it is determined by the electron density at the positron, and
Zeﬀ can be calculated as [46],

Zeﬀ =

|Ψ(r1, r2, . . . , rN , r)|2 δ(ri − r)dr1 . . . drN dr,

N

Z

Xi=1

where Ψ(r1, r2, . . . , rN , r) is the full (N + 1)-particle wavefunction of the N electron coordinates ri and positron
coordinate r. The wavefunction is normalised to a positron plane wave at large positron-atom separations,

Ψ(r1, r2, . . . , rN , r) ≃ Φ0(r1, r2, . . . , rN )eik·r

,

where Φ0(r1, r2, . . . , rN ) is the atomic ground-state wavefunction, and k is the incident positron momentum.

Although Zeﬀ is basically a cross section, Eq. (20) has the form of a transition amplitude. This enables one to apply
the apparatus of many-body theory to this quantity directly [3, 34]. In this “transition amplitude” the initial and
i δ(ri − r), plays the role of a perturbation.
ﬁnal states are identical, and the electron-positron two-body operator,
The positron energy in the initial and ﬁnal states is the same, ε = k2/2, and (owing to the spherical symmetry
of the target) the perturbation conserves the positron angular momentum l. Therefore, the contribution of each
positron partial wave to Zeﬀ can be determined separately. The corresponding many-body diagrammatic expansion
is presented in Fig. 4.

cf. Eq. (3) for the 2nd-order contribution to the correlation potential. In the calculations of annihilation we assume
that the positron energy is below all other inelastic thresholds, hence, we have dropped i0 in the energy denominator.
Physically, the 1st-order diagram describes positron annihilation with an electron “pulled out” from the atom by
the positron’s Coulomb ﬁeld. Calculations in Refs. [3, 34] showed that for noble-gas atoms the size of the 1st-order
corrections is approximately equal to the 0th-order contribution. This means that higher-order terms must also be
taken into account.

FIG. 4: Diagrammatic expansion of Zeﬀ . Apart from the 0th and 1st order diagrams (a), (b) and (c), the main types of
2nd-order diagrams are shown. The external lines of these diagrams (ε) represent the wavefunction of the incident positron.
The solid circle corresponds to the electron-positron δ-function annihilation vertex.

Diagrams (d)–(h) in Fig. 4 illustrate the main types of 2nd-order corrections to the annihilation vertex. It is also
important to consider corrections to the incident positron wavefunctions denoted by ε. However, these corrections are
included in all orders in the positron quasiparticle wavefunction, obtained from the Dyson equation (1), or via equation
(16). Hence their contribution to Zeﬀ is accounted for by using the positron Dyson orbitals ψε in the calculation of
the annihilation diagrams.

The presence of the δ-function operator in the annihilation diagrams enhances the importance of small electron-
positron separations. For this reason, the most important diagrams in Zeﬀ are those with the Coulomb interactions
between the annihilating pair, e.g., the 2nd-order diagrams (d) and (e) in Fig. 4 (the latter together with its mirror
image), and similar higher-order terms. A complete all-order calculation of their contribution is achieved by using
the vertex function, as shown in Fig. 5. Note that for hydrogen this set of diagrams is exhaustive, provided the
intermediate electron and positron states are calculated in the ﬁeld of the bare nucleus. Previously diagrams (c)–(f)
in Fig. 5 have only been estimated [34]. We will see that the ability to calculate these diagrams accurately is crucial
for obtaining correct values of Zeﬀ . We will also see in Sec. IV that the role of the vertex function (representing
virtual Ps) in annihilation is much greater than in scattering.

FIG. 5: Main contributions to the positron-atom annihilation parameter Zeﬀ . To account for the mirror images of the diagrams
(b), (d) and (e), their contributions are multiplied by 2.

Of course, for many-electron targets one can also consider other diagrams, e.g., (f)–(h) in Fig. 4. In particular,
diagram (f) describes screening of the electron-positron Coulomb interaction by other electrons [cf. Fig. 1 (e)].
Diagram (g) can be viewed as the lowest-order “pick-oﬀ” annihilation contribution. Here the positron excites an
electron-hole pair (a precursor of virtual Ps formation) and annihilates with an electron from one of the ground-state
orbitals. Diagram (h) is independent of the positron energy. It represents one of the corrections to the HF ground-state

electron density, cf. Fig. 1(h). Unlike the diagrams in Fig. 5, these contributions are not systematically enhanced by
the electron-positron Coulomb interaction at small distances.

It is clear from Fig. 4 that most correlation corrections to the annihilation vertex, including the dominant sequence

of diagrams in Fig. 5, are nonlocal. As a result, the total Zeﬀ can be written as

Zeﬀ =

|ϕn(r)|2|ψε(r)|2dr +

ε (r)∆ε(r, r′)ψε(r′)drdr′,
ψ∗

Z Xn

Z

where ∆ε(r, r′) represents the nonlocal correlation correction to the annihilation vertex. In the approximation of Fig.
5, it is equal to the sum of all diagrams (b)–(f) with the external positron lines ε detached. Diagram (h) in Fig. 4
and similar diagrams which represent corrections to the HF electron density, could be included by replacing of the
n |ϕn(r)|2 in Eq. (24) with the exact target electron density ρe(r). Given the high accuracy of
HF electron density
the HF density, this would make only a small change in Zeﬀ. The structure of Eq. (24) shows that even when one
uses the best single-particle positron wavefunction, the annihilation rate is not reduced to a simple (local) overlap of
the electron and positron densities.

P

There is an important physical diﬀerence between the correlation eﬀects in positron scattering and annihilation.
The key role played by the long-range polarisation potential for low-energy positrons means that large distances are
important. Polarisation also emphasises the role played by the dipole part of the positron-target Coulomb interaction
and dipole target excitations. The contribution of virtual Ps formation to ΣE is a short-range eﬀect. The typical
distances here are comparable to the radius of the atom, or the radius of ground-state Ps. The net eﬀect of the
strong positron-atom attraction brings about low-lying virtual s-states (see, e.g., [42]) for Ar, Kr and Xe [34], or
positron-atom weakly bound states, e.g., in Mg [33, 35]. In both cases, the positron scattering phaseshifts and the
positron quasiparticle wavefunction in the vicinity of the atom vary rapidly as functions of the positron energy.

On the contrary, in the annihilation diagrams the δ-function vertex emphasises small electron-positron separations.
By the uncertainty principle, such small separations correspond to high-energy excitations in the intermediate states
in the diagrams (b)–(f), Fig. 5. As a result, the non-local correction to the annihilation vertex, ∆ε, has a weak energy
dependence, and the energy dependence of the 2nd term in Eq. (24) is almost entirely due to that of the positron
wavefunctions. The only exception is when the positron energy approaches the Ps-formation threshold from below.
Here the virtual-Ps contribution, Fig. 5(f), rises sharply. Details of the threshold behaviour of Zeﬀ are discussed in
Ref. [48].

The large diﬀerence in the energy scales characteristic of positron scattering and annihilation has another physically
important consequence. It turns out that the relative size of the annihilation vertex corrections in Zeﬀ , i.e. the ratio of
the 2nd term in Eq. (24) to Z (0)
eﬀ , is about the same, whether ψε are the positron wavefunctions in the repulsive static
potential, ψε = ϕε, or the Dyson orbitals which fully account for the positron-atom correlation potential. Numerical
illustrations of this eﬀect will be provided in Sec. IV.

Finally, we should mention that the correct normalisation of Zeﬀ for positrons with angular momentum l is obtained

by multiplying the diagrams in Figs. 4 and 5 by the extra numerical factor,

This follows from the structure of the positron wavefunction ψk, which has the asymptotic behaviour of a plane wave
eik·r at large distances [cf. Eq. (21)],

III. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

A. Use of B-splines and convergence

To derive Eq. (25), one can use ψk as the external positron lines in an annihilation diagram, and perform averaging
over the directions of k.

To evaluate the diagrams of the correlation potential Σ and annihilation parameter Zeﬀ , one ﬁrst needs to generate
sets of electron and positron HF basis states. These are then used to calculate matrix elements of the Coulomb
and δ-function operators, the main building blocks of the diagrams. Evaluation of the diagrams requires summation

over complete sets of electron and positron intermediate states, including integration over the electron and positron
continua.

To perform a numerical calculation, the continuous spectrum can be discretised. The simplest way of doing this is
by placing the system in a spherical cavity of radius R. Setting the wavefunctions to zero at the boundary will result
in a discrete spectrum of eigenstates with an approximately constant stepsize in momentum space,

∆k ≈ π/R.

If the value of R is suﬃciently large (R ≫ Rat, where Rat ∼ 1 a.u.
is the size of the atom), the presence of
the boundary will not aﬀect the quantities calculated. Indeed, for the positron energy below all inelastic thresholds
(except, of course, annihilation), the intermediate states in the diagrams are virtual, and no particle in an intermediate
state can escape to inﬁnity.

The drawback of this procedure is that for a suitably large R, the stepsize in momentum is small, e.g., for R = 30 a.u.,
∆k ≈ 0.1 a.u. Hence, one would need large numbers of intermediate states to achieve convergence. Note that the
actual upper energy limit depends on the quantity in question. Thus, diagrams in Zeﬀ converge more slowly than
those of the correlation potential Σ, because of the greater role of small electron-positron separations and high orbital
angular momenta in the former. However, as a rough guide, summing up to the energy of 102 a.u. should be suﬃcient
for both. The question of the number of intermediate states is especially important for the calculation of the vertex
function Γ, which is a NΓ × NΓ matrix [see Eq. (6)], where NΓ ∼ N 2(lmax + 1), N being the number of electron or
positron states in each partial wave and lmax being the largest orbital angular momentum included. It is clear that
here the simple cavity quantisation cannot work.

Instead, to achieve an accurate and economical span of the continuum we use B-splines [49]. B-splines of order k are
n piecewize polynomials of degree k − 1 deﬁned by a knot sequence rj which divides the interval [0, R] into n − k + 1
segments [50]. The basis states are obtained by expanding the radial wavefunctions Pl(r) in terms of B-splines Bi(r),

and ﬁnding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the radial part of the HF (or hydrogen atom) Hamiltonian for each
orbital angular momentum l by solving the generalised eigenvalue problem,

Pl(r) =

C(l)

i Bi(r),

X

Hij C(l)

j = ε

QijC(l)
j

,

X

X

where Hij = hBi|H (l)
0 |Bji, and Qij = hBi|Bji. Prior to solving Eq. (29), the ground-state atom HF Hamiltonian is
generated by a conventional HF routine [51]. Note that in the sums over i and j in Eqs. (28) and (29) the ﬁrst and
last splines are discarded to implement the boundary condition Pl(0) = Pl(R) = 0, leaving one with a set of n − 2
eigenstates for each electron and positron orbital angular momentum. When Eq. (29) is solved for the electron, it
yields the wavefunctions of the orbitals occupied in the atomic ground state (holes), as well as those of the excited
states (particles). The exact energies of the excited electron and positron states are determined by the B-spline radial
knot sequence.

It is instructive to try to design an ideal distribution of energies of a discrete set spanning the continuum. Qual-
itatively, at low energies (ε ≪ 1 a.u.) the continuous spectrum states oscillate slowly, and the contribution of large
distances in the matrix elements is important (hence, the need for a large R). As the energy of the states increases,
the range of important distances becomes smaller and smaller. Indeed, the matrix elements then contain rapidly
oscillating factors of eikr type, which means that the dominant contribution comes from r <
∼ k−1. Therefore, one does
not need a large value of the cavity radius R for the higher-energy states. More speciﬁcally, one can estimate the
necessary radius as R ∼ a/k, where a is a number greater than unity. Combining this with the cavity quantisation
condition (27), one obtains ∆k/k ∼ π/a, which yields the following grid in momentum space:

where k0 is the lowest momentum, β = π/a, and j = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Thus, it appears that the optimal momentum and
energy grids are exponential. By choosing a small initial momentum k0 ≪ 1 a.u. and β < 1 one ensures that the
stepsize in momentum, ∆k ≈ βk, is suﬃciently small, to describe accurately the energy variation of the quantities
summed.

It turns out that basis sets generated by Eqs. (28) and (29) using an exponential radial knot sequence [49] are a
very close realisation of the exponential energy grid, and are eﬀectively complete. In the present work we use n = 40
B-splines of order k = 6 with a knot sequence

kj = k0eβj,

rj = ρ(eσj − 1),

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

where ρ = 10−3 a.u., and σ is determined by the condition rn−k+1 = R. Figure 6 shows the positive eigenenergies of
the electron and positron basis states with l = 0 for the hydrogen atom. Their distribution does indeed correspond to
the exponential ansatz, Eq. (30), with β ≈ σ. The highest energies in the sets are about 108 a.u. This value is close
to the magnitude of (ρσ)−2, since the knot point closest to the origin determines the most rapidly varying eigenstate
(by the uncertainty principle). In fact, it may not be necessary to include all 38 basis states in each partial wave in
the many-body theory sums. In the calculations reported in this paper we use only about 15 lowest states, which
span the energy range from threshold to ∼ 102 a.u.

−0.05542 and −0.00246 a.u.) are not shown.

Note that B-spline basis sets are used widely in atomic physics [49], and that there are other basis sets which
show a near-exponential spanning of the continuum. In particular, Laguerre basis states provide rapid convergence
in close-coupling electron-atom scattering calculations [52].

B. Calculation of the self-energy and annihilation diagrams

The self-energy and annihilation diagrams are calculated by summation over the B-spline basis states, and the
vertex function is found by matrix inversion from Eq. (6). The angular parts of the states are separated in the matrix
elements and the angular variables are integrated over analytically. The actual expressions for the diagrams are given
in the Appendix. The self-energy matrix and the vertex function are energy dependent. In practice, the self-energy
matrix has been calculated at 8 energies spaced evenly from zero to the Ps formation threshold. Interpolation onto
any required energy E is then used.

Apart from the B-spline basis states, we also consider true positron continuum HF states (12). They are needed
to evaluate the matrix elements hε|ΣE|ε′i and obtain the phaseshifts via Eqs. (13)–(15). Here we use 201 states that
form an equidistant mesh in positron momenta of size ∆k = 0.02. A transformation of the B-spline basis matrix
elements hi|ΣE|ji into hε|ΣE|ε′i could be done using the eﬀective completeness of the B-spline states on the interval
[0, R],

hε|ΣE|ε′i =

hε|iihi|ΣE|jihj|ε′i,

Xi ,j

(32)

where hε|ii is the overlap of the HF state with the B-spline basis state. However, unlike the B-spline states which
satisfy the zero boundary condition at r = R, the continuous spectrum state Pεl is ﬁnite at the boundary. To ﬁx this

problem we insert a radial weighting function f (r) = R − r into equation (32), which now reads

hε|ΣE|ε′i =

hε|f |iihi|f −1ΣEf −1|jihj|f |ε′i,

Xi, j

and calculate the “weighted” self-energy matrix hi|f −1ΣEf −1|ji, rather than hi|ΣE|ji. The singularity of f −1 at
r = R does not cause a problem, since the B-spline basis states in the Coulomb matrix elements involved, vanish at
r = R. The same trick is applied in the calculation of the annihilation diagrams.

To calculate hε|ΣE|ε′i more accurately at low positron energies, where distances beyond r = R can be important,
we make use of the long-range asymptotic form of the correlation potential (4). The contribution of r > R can be
evaluated as

with the correct value of the dipole polarisability α, and added to hε|ΣE|ε′i.

C. Convergence with respect to the orbital angular momenta

The use of a B-spline basis means that fast convergence is achieved with respect to the number of states with a
particular orbital angular momentum. However, this leaves open the question of convergence with respect to the
maximal orbital angular momentum of the electron and positron intermediate states included in the calculation. It
has been known for a while that calculations of positron-atom scattering converge slowly with respect to the number
of target angular momenta included in the expansion of the total wavefunction, notably slower than in the electron-
atom case [53]. This is also true for the conﬁguration-interaction-type calculations of positron-atom bound states
[17, 19, 54] and scattering [20]. Calculations of annihilation rates converge even more slowly [19, 20, 54]. Physically,
the slow convergence rate arises from the need to describe virtual Ps localised outside the atom by an expansion in
terms of single-particle orbitals centred on the nucleus.

The problem of the convergence rate with respect to the maximal orbital angular momentum has been investigated
by the authors in Ref. [55]. Using a perturbation-theory approach and the original ideas of Schwartz [56], we derived
asymptotic formulae that describe the convergence of the scattering amplitudes, or the phase shifts, and annihilation
rates, or Zeﬀ. The contribution of high orbital angular momenta probes small particle separations in the system. The
diﬀerence between the convergence rates of the scattering and annihilation parameters is due to the presence of either
the Coulomb interaction or the δ-function annihilation operator in the relevant amplitudes.

The increments to the phaseshifts and Zeﬀ upon increasing the maximum orbital angular momentum from λ − 1
to λ, were found to behave as (λ + 1/2)−4 and (λ + 1/2)−2, respectively. This means that if a series of calculations
is stopped at some maximal angular momentum λ = lmax, the values obtained approach the ultimate (lmax → ∞)
values as follows:

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

where A and B are some constants. They are determined together with δl and Zeﬀ by ﬁtting Eqs. (35) and (36)
to the numerical data obtained for a range of lmax. This extrapolation to lmax → ∞ is performed at each positron
momentum value considered, and is especially important for obtaining correct values of Zeﬀ .

IV. RESULTS: SCATTERING AND ANNIHILATION ON HYDROGEN

The theory outlined above can be readily applied to any closed-shell atom or ion.

In this paper we would like
to test it for the simplest possible target, the hydrogen atom. Since it contains only one electron, the correlation
potential from Eq. (9) and the Zeﬀ diagrams in Fig. 5 give an exact solution of the elastic scattering and annihilation
problems, provided the intermediate electron and positron states are calculated in the ﬁeld of H+. The key advance of
the present many-body theory of positron-atom interactions relates to the calculation of the electron-positron vertex

12

function Γ, Eq. (6) and its incorporation in the self-energy and annihilation diagrams. It is mainly these features of
the theory that a positron-hydrogen calculation is intended to test.

In the numerical implementation we ﬁrst generate the electron and positron B-spline basis sets. They are then used
to evaluate the matrix elements, ﬁnd the vertex function and calculate the self-energy and annihilation diagrams (see
Appendix). Using the self-energy matrix, the phaseshifts are obtained by means of Eqs. (13)–(15), and the positron
Dyson orbital is calculated from Eqs. (16) and (18). In the end, the Dyson orbitals replace the positron HF states
in the external lines of the annihilation diagrams, and ﬁnal values of Zeﬀ are obtained. To test the stability of the
results with respect to the cavity radius, the calculations were performed with R = 15 and 30 a.u.

To extrapolate the scattering phaseshifts and Zeﬀ to lmax → ∞, as per Eqs.

(35) and (36), the diagrams are
evaluated for a range of maximal orbital angular momenta, lmax = 7–10. This procedure is illustrated by Fig. 7 for
the phaseshifts and Fig. 8 for Zeﬀ, for the s-, p- and d-wave incident positron with momenta k = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 a.u.

angular momentum lmax for R = 15 a.u. Circles, k = 0.2 a.u.; squares, k = 0.4 a.u.; diamonds, k = 0.6 a.u.

Figures 7 and 8 show that the calculations have converged to the regime in which the asymptotic formulae (35) for
δl and (36) for Zeﬀ , may be applied. The graphs also illustrate the point that the inclusion of high orbital angular
momenta and extrapolation to lmax → ∞ is much more important in the calculations of annihilation, compared with
scattering. For the positron momenta and partial waves shown, between 15% and 30% of the ﬁnal value of Zeﬀ is due
to such extrapolation. Quantitatively, this contribution can be characterised by the ratio B/Zeﬀ , see Eq. (36), given
in Table I. Its increase with the positron angular momentum may be related to the greater role of the correlation
corrections to the annihilation vertex in higher positron partial partial waves (see below).

Figure 9 shows the s-, p- and d-wave phaseshifts for the total correlation potential (9). They are in very good
agreement with those from an accurate variational calculation (see Ref. [13]), the discrepancy being of order 10−3 rad.
The values obtained with R = 15 and R = 30 a.u. are almost indistinguishable, except at low positron momenta.
Here the results for R = 30 are superior to those for R = 15. The larger cavity size allows for a better account of the

long range −α/2r4 tail in the polarisation potential.

Examining the phaseshifts allows us to compare the relative sizes of the polarisation and Ps-formation contributions
to the correlation potential (9). The static positron-atom potential is repulsive, resulting in negative values of the
phase shifts (thin solid curves). The inclusion of Σ, i.e., correlations, makes the low-energy phase shifts positive.
Dashed curves in Fig. 9 show the phaseshifts obtained by including only the 2nd-order diagram Σ(2) (polarisation),
while dot-dashed curves are those obtained with Σ(Γ) alone (virtual Ps-formation). We see that none of these results
is close to the phaseshift obtained with the full Σ. This means that neither contribution dominates the correlation
potential, and the inclusion of both polarisation and virtual Ps-formation eﬀects is essential for solving the positron-
atom problem. Of course, any calculation which produces accurate positron-hydrogen phaseshifts contains these
contributions implicitly. The advantage of the many-body theory approach is that one can separate them, and get a
better insight into the physics of the system.

To illustrate the non-perturbative nature of virtual Ps formation we have also performed calculations that include
the vertex function only to 1st order, ΓE = V , in Σ(Γ) (dotted curves in Fig. 9). This approximation accounts only
for about 50% of the total vertex function contribution. Note that the higher-order terms in Γ become even more
important close to the Ps formation threshold (k ≈ 0.7) in p and d waves. This is related to the virtual Ps becoming
more “real” close to the threshold.

We now turn to positron annihilation. Having solved the scattering problem accurately with the full Σ, we are now
in possession of the best (quasiparticle) positron wavefunction, the Dyson orbital. Before using it in all annihilation
diagrams, let us ﬁrst look at the eﬀect of the Dyson orbital on the 0th-order diagram, Fig. 5(a), for the s-wave
Zeﬀ. Figure 10 shows that the 0th-order contribution, Eq. (22), evaluated with the positron wavefunction in the
static atomic potential gives values up to 20 times smaller than the accurate variational results [57]. This situation is
similar to that in positron annihilation on noble-gas atoms, where Eq. (22) evaluated with the static (HF) positron
wavefunction underestimates experimental Zeﬀ by a factor of 101–103 at low positron energies [3, 34]. It is natural
that the use of the Dyson orbital, which is “aware” of the positron-atom attraction, in Eq. (22), leads to increased
Zeﬀ, and introduces a correct momentum dependence (dashed curve in Fig. 10). This latter fact is in agreement with
the general understanding of the origins of the energy dependence and enhancement of Zeﬀ at low energies, and their
relation to positron-atom virtual states [3, 34, 58]. However, the absolute values obtained are still about 5 times lower
than the benchmark.

The remaining 80% come from the nonlocal corrections to the annihilation vertex, diagrams (b)–(f) in Fig. 5. The
contributions of all the diagrams evaluated using the positron Dyson orbitals, and the total Zeﬀ are shown in Fig. 11
for the positron s, p and d partial waves.

FIG. 10: Contribution of the 0th order diagram, Fig. 5(a), to the positron-hydrogen s-wave annihilation parameter Zeﬀ ,
calculated with the positron wavefunction in the static atomic potential (solid curve), and with the Dyson orbital (dashed
curve). Circles connected by dotted curve are the accurate results of Refs. [57].

The diﬃculty of calculating the vertex corrections to Zeﬀ accurately is evident from these graphs, as all the diagrams
in Fig. 5 contribute signiﬁcantly. The higher-order diagrams containing the vertex function, are close to or greater
than the lower-order diagrams. Note that all contributions have a similar dependence on the positron momentum. It
is driven by the momentum dependence of the positron Dyson orbitals (external lines in the diagrams), as discussed
in Sec. II D.

Figure 11 shows that for p and d waves, the contribution of the diagram Fig. 5(f) grows rapidly and becomes largest
towards the Ps formation threshold. This diagram describes annihilation inside the virtual Ps formation, which has a
vigorous energy dependence close to threshold [48]. This may have a bearing on the kinks in Zeﬀ visible at k ≈ 0.6 a.u.
for the p and d waves. Although they may be a numerical artifact, an indication of an inﬂection point is also present
in the accurate p-wave results of Ref. [57].

The ﬁnal results for R = 15 a.u. are slightly higher than for R = 30 a.u. Indeed, annihilation takes place near the
atom, and a denser knot sequence for R = 15 may provide a better description of small electron-positron separations.
Our ﬁnal values compare well with the accurate positron-hydrogen results obtained using a variational approach [57].
In that work the electron-positron distance was represented explicitly in the calculation, while we use a single-centre
expansion. We believe that the remaining small discrepancy could be eliminated by ‘pushing harder’ the numerics in
our approach. Thus, Fig. 12 shows that if we use n = 60 B-splines of order k = 9 and include the ﬁrst 23 basis states,
the diﬀerence between our Zeﬀ and the benchmark values is halved.

The main conclusion of this section is that the numerical implementation of the many-body theory approach
proposed in this paper works. For positron collisions with hydrogen, where this approach is exact, the calculations
reproduce the best scattering phaseshifts, and yield good results in the more diﬃcult annihilation problem.

V. CORRELATION CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANNIHILATION VERTEX.

The ability of a many-body theory to describe correlation corrections to the annihilation vertex may give some
insight into the role such corrections play in positron annihilation with matter. Thus, in theoretical studies of positron
annihilation in condensed matter, one usually starts by performing a calculation for the ground state electron and
positron densities. The annihilation rate is then found via an equation of the form (see, e.g., [6]),

where ρp(r) and ρe(r) are the positron and electron densities and γ(ρe, ρp) is the so-called enhancement factor. It is
introduced to account for the Coulomb attraction in the annihilating electron-positron pair. It has long been known
that the independent-particle approximation (γ = 1) underestimates the annihilation rates by several times [59], and
a number of semi-empirical and interpolation forms of γ(ρe, ρp) have been suggested (see, e.g., Ref. [60] and references
therein).

A comparison between Eq. (37) with γ = 1 and the many-body theory expression (24) for the annihilation rate,
shows that the former corresponds to the 0th-order term in Zeﬀ, Eq. (22) [61]. As we have seen in Sec. IV (Fig. 10),
Z (0)
eﬀ does underestimate the annihilation rate in hydrogen by a factor of 5, even when the best positron wavefunction
is used. On the other hand, the correlation correction to the annihilation rate [2nd term in Eq. (24)] does not have the
form of Eq. (37). This correction depends on the positron wavefunction at two diﬀerent points, r and r′. Therefore,
any local expression like Eq. (37) is necessarily an approximation.

To illustrate this point, a contour plot in Fig. 13 shows the radial part of the integrand of the nonlocal term,

P

The quantity ¯γ can also be deﬁned as the ratio of the total Zeﬀ to the value obtained from the 0th-order diagram,
Z (0)
eﬀ , Fig. 5(a). Because of the weak energy dependence of ∆ε (see Sec. II D), this ratio should not depend strongly
on the energy of the incident positron. This also implies that ¯γ will be relatively insensitive to the wavefunction
used to describe the incident positron. In particular, the use of either HF or Dyson wavefunctions ψε for the incident
positron should yield close values of ¯γ.

As a test, this ratio was evaluated for the annihilation of the s, p and d-wave positrons on hydrogen, see Fig. 14.
As expected, the values of ¯γ depend weakly on the incident positron energy, except when the Ps formation threshold
is approached. This conﬁrms the earlier observation that the momentum dependence of various contributions to Zeﬀ
in Fig. 11 is approximately the same. The results obtained within the static approximation and with the Dyson
orbitals are also very close to each other, even though the absolute values of Zeﬀ obtained in the two approximations
are very diﬀerent (see, e.g., Fig. 10). One cannot help noticing that the enhancement due to annihilation vertex
corrections increases with the angular momentum of the positron. For larger l, the penetration of the positron into
the electron-rich regions of the atom is suppressed by the centrifugal barrier, and the eﬀect of “pulling the electron
out” (i.e., virtual Ps formation), described by the correlation corrections, becomes more important.

Equation (37) is local, whereas equation (24) contains a non-local term. In order to compare the enhancement of
Zeﬀ due to this term with the enhancement factors used in condensed matter calculations, we need to “localise” the
contribution of ∆ε(r, r′). Let us do this by introducing an eﬀective ‘electron correlation density’ ˜ρe(r) via the relation

for positron annihilation in the lth partial wave. This allows us to deﬁne an eﬀective enhancement factor γe(r) through

dot-dashed line, γe for d-wave positrons at k = 0.5.

A feature common to all enhancement factors in Fig. 16 is their rapid rise with the distance from the nucleus.
This increase is related to the drop of the electron density, a relation which is explicit in Eq. (45) for γAP. At small
distances, where the electron density is large, γAP compares well with γe. However, at larger distances, where the
electron density is low, γAP is much greater than all of the γe. Such a discrepancy could be expected, given that a
homogeneous electron gas theory used to derive γAP is more reliable in the high-density limit. The exaggeration of
the enhancement by γAP was reported in Ref.
[60] where various forms of the enhancement factor were tested by
comparison with accurate annihilation rates for a number of positron-atom bound systems. For Be and Mg (which
have I > 6.8 eV), the values obtained using γAP overestimated the accurate annihilation rates by factors of 5 and
2, respectively. It must be noted that the product ρeγAP remains ﬁnite as ρe → 0. This means that one cannot in
principle use it in Eq. (37) for a continuous spectrum positron, since it would yield inﬁnite values of the annihilation
rate and Zeﬀ. For the same reason a much stronger overestimate observed in Ref.
[60] with γAP for Be is a direct
consequence of the positron binding energy for Be being much smaller than for Mg.

Figure 16 conﬁrms that γe is energy-dependent. It is greater for k = 0.5 a.u. compared with k = 0.06 (s wave), the
higher momentum being closer to the Ps formation threshold. Values of γe derived for the p and d waves are similar
to those from the s wave. Hence, the large diﬀerences between the average enhancement factors in Fig. 14 are due to
the eﬀect of the centrifugal barrier on the positron wavefunction. The distances which eﬀectively contribute to Zeﬀ
are greater for the positron in higher partial waves.

VI. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

21

In this paper we have formulated a many-body theory approach which accounts for the main correlation eﬀects
in positron-atom interactions. These are (i) polarisation of the target by the positron, (ii) virtual positronium
formation, and (iii) strong enhancement of the electron-positron contact density due to their Coulomb interaction.
The key development for an accurate description of (ii) and (iii) is the summation of the ladder diagram series and
calculation of the electron-positron vertex function. B-spline basis sets and extrapolation over the orbital angular
momenta are used to achieve convergence of the sums over the electron and positron intermediate states. The method
can be applied to a range of problems such as positron scattering, annihilation and formation of bound states.

Although our main interest is in exploring many-electron targets, the method has been ﬁrst tested for hydrogen,
where accurate benchmark data exist for the scattering phaseshifts and annihilation rates. In the case of hydrogen
the present formalism is exact. Numerically, excellent agreement with accurate variational calculations for the phase
shifts has been obtained, together with a good agreement for the annihilation parameter Zeﬀ. The calculation of
the most diﬃcult part of the correlation potential, which contains the vertex function, for many-electron atoms is
only marginally more diﬃcult than for hydrogen. Therefore, we expect that application of our many-body theory to
the problems of positron scattering and annihilation on noble-gas atoms and binding to halogen ions [63, 64] should
yield accurate results. In particular, we would like to re-examine and improve the accuracy of the many-body theory
predictions [33] of positron binding energies to the ns2 atoms such as Mg, Cd and Zn.

The advantage of many-body theory methods is their physical transparency. It allows one to distinguish between
diﬀerent physical mechanisms and compare their relative importance. Thus, we saw that virtual Ps formation in
positron-hydrogen scattering is just as important as the target polarisation. Correlation corrections to the annihila-
tion vertex, which are physically related to the virtual Ps formation, are even more important. They enhance the
annihilation rate in hydrogen by a factor of 5 or more, depending on the positron partial wave. Such vertex corrections
depend weakly on the positron energy, and the enhancement they produce is practically the same for various positron
wavefunctions. Therefore, one could use the average enhancement factors derived for isolated atoms to obtain reli-
able annihilation rates for atoms placed in diﬀerent environments, provided that a suﬃciently accurate single-particle
positron wavefunction is available. Of course, diﬀerent atomic subshells will be characterised by diﬀerent enhancement
factors. However, they can all be determined in an many-body calculations of the type described in this paper, and
serve as an input for the calculations of positron annihilation in molecules or condensed matter.

In this work we have analysed the spatial dependence of the nonlocal correlation corrections to the annihilation
vertex. We have also derived the equivalent local enhancement factor and compared it with an expression used
in condensed matter calculations. Similar comparisons for larger many-electron targets may test various forms of
enhancement factors in a much greater range of electron densities.

The rapid development of computers over the past few decades seems to have favoured theoretical methods other
than many-body theory. Such methods often rely more on the computer power and numerical techniques than on the
physical insight. They often appear to be “more exact” than the sophisticated but explicitly approximate many-body
theory approaches, and promise improved results due to shear growth of computer power. Their drawback is that they
do not always increase one’s physical understanding of the problem. We believe that a further theoretical development
of many-body methods combined with a judicial use of computers is a healthy alternative.

APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL DETAILS

For a positron interacting with a spherically-symmetric target, both the self energy ΣE(r, r′) and the correlation

correction to the annihilation vertex ∆E(r, r′) can be expanded in partial waves, e.g.,

The angular reduction of the various diagrams in hε|ΣE|ε′i and hε|∆E|εi is simpliﬁed by the use of graphical techniques
for performing angular momentum algebra [65]. The ﬁnal expressions for the diagrams in terms of reduced matrix
elements, 3j and 6j symbols are given below.

where [l1] ≡ 2l1 + 1, etc. Note that instead of including the minus sign in the reduced Coulomb matrix element when
it involves the positron, we account for it in the overall sign factor for the diagram (see below). The reduced Coulomb

This expression is similar to the ‘exchange’ matrix element that one meets in all-electron problems [22].

The sum of the ladder diagram series (the vertex function) is calculated via the matrix equation (6), which must

be solved for all possible total angular momenta J of the electron-positron pair:

In the Appendix, the state labels ν, ν1, etc., refer to the positron orbitals ενlν, εν1lν1 , etc. Similarly, µ, µ1, etc.,
label excited-state electron orbitals. Electron orbitals occupied in the target ground state (holes) are labeled by Latin
indices (n). When B-spline basis states are used, Eq. (A5) is a ﬁnite-dimension matrix equation solved by matrix
inversion.

The self-energy diagrams can be expressed in terms of these matrix elements. For closed-shell atoms, each loop in
the diagram gives a spin factor of 2. This factor should be omitted for hydrogen which has only one electron in the
1s orbital. The sign factor for each diagram is (−1)a+b+c, where a is the number of hole lines, b is the number of
electron-hole loops and c is the number of positron-electron Coulomb interactions. In the expressions below we label
the incident positron angular momentum by lp. This is also the orbital angular momentum of the external lines ε, ε′
of the diagrams.

The various diagrams contributing to Zeﬀ can then be expressed in terms of these matrix elements. As with the
self energy diagrams, the factor of 2 which results from closed loops, must be removed for hydrogen. Note that in the
diagrams below, we also include factors of 2 to account for the mirror images of those diagrams that are not symmetric.
To produce correct values of Zeﬀ the expressions given below must be multiplied by the positron normalisation factor
(25).

[47] This cross section is given by σ2γ = πr2

0(c/v), where v is the electron-positron relative velocity, see, e.g., V. B. Berestetskii,
E. M. Lifshitz, and L. P. Pitaevskii, Quantum electrodynamics (Pergamon, Oxford, 1982). Annihilation into two gamma
quanta is allowed only for the zero total spin of the pair, S = 0. For S = 1 they annihilate into three photons. The
corresponding spin-averaged cross section is almost 400 times smaller: σ3γ = [4(π2 − 9)/3]αr2
0 (c/v), where α = e2/¯hc ≈
1/137.

We discuss the two-center, time-dependent Dirac equation
describing the dynamics of an electron during a peripheral,
relativistic heavy-ion collision at extreme energies. We derive
a factored form, which is exact in the high-energy limit, for
the asymptotic channel solutions of the Dirac equation, and
elucidate their close connection with gauge transformations
which transform the dynamics into a representation in which
the interaction between the electron and a distant ion is of
short range. We describe the implications of this relationship
for solving the time-dependent Dirac equation for extremely
relativistic collisions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Particle production via electromagnetic processes in
peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions has received
signiﬁcant study recently, both experimentally [1–11] and
theoretically (for reviews, see [12–14]), due to anticipated
experimental opportunities at colliding-beam accelera-
tors, and the importance of this phenomena for the oper-
ation and performance of such facilities. Also of interest
is the opportunity to study strong-ﬁeld QED eﬀects in
particle production over a wide range of charge and col-
lision energy [15–25] .

The high-energy limit of peripheral relativistic heavy-
ion collisions has been recently examined, and closed-
form expressions for the amplitudes describing electron-
positron pair production have been obtained [26–29].
These new results oﬀer signiﬁcant insight into the un-
derstanding of relativistic heavy-ion collision dynamics
[26–32].
In these works, the consequences of allowing
the collision velocity to approach the speed of light, i.e.
β ≡ v/c → 1, and thus the collision energy to approach
inﬁnity, γ ≡ (1 − β2)−1/2 → ∞, have been investi-
gated. This limit has been motivated by the progress
toward new colliding-beam heavy-ion accelerator facili-
ties currently in various stages of construction and plan-
ning. The Relativistic Heavy-ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory will begin operation in
1999, oﬀering collision velocities in the collider frame of
βC ≈ 0.9999. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), cur-
rently being planned at CERN, will oﬀer collision ve-
locities which more closely approach the speed of light,

βC ≈ 0.9999999.
Indeed, in experiments recently per-
formed at CERN’s SPS [1,4,9,10], in which heavy-ions
collide in a ﬁxed-target mode, the equivalent collider-
frame collision velocity exceeds 0.99c, suggesting that the
high-energy limit is already a meaningful and relevant
approximation for use in interpreting the experimental
results [29].

Of central importance to recent investigations of the
high-energy limit is the use of a simpliﬁed form, accu-
rate to leading order in the small parameter γ−2, for
the Lorentz-boosted Coulomb potential [33–35,27] act-
ing between the active electron and a bare nucleus. In
this form, the dependence of the interaction on the trans-
verse electron coordinates separates from the dependence
on the longitudinal coordinate z and the time t. More-
over, the dependence on the latter arises in combinations
identiﬁed as the lightfront variables, e.g. τ± ≡ (z ± t)/2,
in the form of a zero-range or sharp potential. The sep-
arability of this interaction in the time-dependent, two-
center Dirac equation allows for its closed-form solution
[26–29]. However, this useful form becomes apparant at
the high energy limit only after applying phase transfor-
mations so as to remove the long-range z dependence of
the interaction [35–37].

In this present work, we study these phase transforma-
tions and show how they constitute well-deﬁned gauge
transformations while from a parallel perspective they
formally deﬁne an interaction-representation in which the
asymptotic (i.e. |t| → ∞) interaction of an electron with
a distant ion is absorbed into a redeﬁnition of the elec-
tronic states. In this representation, which we call the
short-range representation, the asymptotic channel states
are free from eﬀects of the distant ion, and in the high
energy limit of inﬁnite γ the interaction has zero range.
In the high-energy limit, the separation is exact. For ﬁ-
nite γ, the short-range interaction is an approximation
correct to order γ−2, and so are the asymptotic channel
wave functions. Neither the two-center Dirac equation,
nor its boundary conditions, are rigorously separable for
ﬁnite γ.

In this context, we review the pioneering work of
Eichler and co-workers [39–41] referred to by the name
Coulomb-boundary conditions, where the long-range
Coulomb or Li´enard-Wiechert interaction was replaced
by an eﬀective short-range interaction. We show how

1

corrections of order γ−2, explicit in our formal deﬁnition
of the short-range representation, are implicit in the re-
placement procedure of the electron-projectile distance
by the target-projectile distance that was used to obtain
the asymptotic channels with these Coulomb-boundary
conditions.

In Sec. II, we discuss the asymptotic channel solutions
for the two-center Dirac equation for extremely relativis-
tic (β → 1, γ → ∞) heavy-ion collisions. We derive
factored forms for the asymptotic solutions which are ac-
curate to order γ−2, i.e. they are exact in the high-energy
limit (γ → ∞). In Sec. II A, we consider the case where
the electron is asymptotically referred to the target ref-
erence frame (i.e. the electron is near to the target as
|t| → ∞), while in Sec. II B, we consider the case were
the electron is asymptotically near to neither the tar-
get nor the projectile ion, and is most naturally referred
to the collider (center-of-velocity) frame. In Sec. III, we
deﬁne and present the short-range representation and de-
rive from it the high-energy or sharp limit for the two-
center Dirac equation in a simple form. In Sec. IV, we
show that the phase transformation deﬁning the short-
range representation constitutes a gauge transformation.
In so doing, we make explicit the connection between the
Coulomb-boundary conditions and the gauge transforma-
tions ﬁrst used by Baltz, Rhoades-Brown, and Weneser
in numerically solving the two-center Dirac equation via
coupled-channel methods [36,37,35]. Alternative treat-
ments of the asymptotic electron-projectile distance and
alternative phase choices for the asymptotic channels are
discussed in the appendices.

II. ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTIONS TO
TWO-CENTER DIRAC EQUATION

We study relativistic heavy-ion collisions with a sin-
gle active electron, e.g. we neglect electron-electron in-
teractions in comparison to the strong electron-ion in-
teractions. An external-ﬁeld approach to the inﬂuence
of the ions on the electron is appropriate for peripheral
impact parameters, heavy-ions, and high energies, where,
to a very good approximation, the ions travel on parallel,
straight-line trajectories, and ion recoil is negligible. We
are using natural units (c = 1, me = 1, and ¯h = 1). The
quantity α is the ﬁne-structure constant, ˇα and ˇγµ are
Dirac matrices in the Dirac representation, as in Ref. [15],
and I4 is the 4-dimensional unit matrix.

A. States referred to a target-ﬁxed inertial frame

Consider ﬁrst a collision of a heavy, point-like projec-
tile ion having charge ZP with a target ion having charge
ZT . We consider the dynamics of a single electron inter-
acting with the external, time-dependent electromagnetic
ﬁeld created by the two heavy ions (see Fig. 1). The

position of the target nucleus is the origin of the elec-
tron coordinates, and the electron has position vector
~rT = ~r = (x, y, z), and time coordinate t. The projectile
moves with constant velocity, β, parallel to the z axis
along a trajectory displaced from the target by the im-
pact parameter ~b. The projectile is located at the origin
of the moving inertial frame, and in the projectile frame
P = ~r ′′ = (x′′, y′′, z′′),
the electron’s position vector is ~r ′′
and time coordinate t′′. Coordinates in the target and
projectile inertial frames are related by an inhomoge-
neous Lorentz transformation (Lorentz boost) parallel to
the z axis such that

⊥ = ~r⊥ − ~b
~r ′′
z′′ = γ(z − βt) ,
t′′ = γ(t − βz) ,

(1)

where ~r⊥ = (x, y) are the transverse spatial coordinates
of the electron in the target frame. The Lorentz boost
implies that the electron-projectile distance in the projec-
tile frame, r′′
(x′′)2 + (y′′)2 + (z′′)2, is represented
P ≡
in target-frame coordinates as

r′′
P (~r, t) =

(~r⊥ − ~b)2 + γ2(z − βt)2 .

(2)

Equivalently, we may refer all coordinates to the projec-
tile nucleus. The resulting relations are obtained by the
replacements P ↔ T , β → −β and ~b → −~b.

is the electron-projectile interaction.

2. Coulomb-boundary conditions

The interactions appearing in the two-center, time-
dependent Dirac equation, Eq. (6), are of long-range
form, so that the distortion of the electron’s wavefunc-
tion induced by a distant ion should not, in principle, be
neglected [13,14,38]. Asymptotic channel wavefunctions
are therefore deﬁned as the solution of the two-center
Dirac equation for asymptotic times. The importance of
including the electron’s interaction with asymptotically
distant ions has been discussed extensively by Eichler and
coworkers [39–41] for relativistic atomic collisions in their
work on the asymptotic solutions known as the Coulomb-
boundary conditions (see Ref. [14], Sec. 5.3.3).

In deﬁning the asymptotic channel solutions for the
the asymptotic
two-center Dirac equation, Eq. (6),
electron-projectile separation r′′
P (~r, t → ∞) is approxi-
mated in Refs. [14,41] by the internuclear separation R′′
(see Appendix A, Eq. (A6)), that is

r′′
P (~r, |t| → ∞) → R′′ =

b2 + γ2(β2z − βt)2 .

(8)

This approximation transforms Eq. (6) to the form

is an approximate asymptotic electron-projectile interac-
tion.

T

With the ansatz (11), both the scalar and the vector com-
ponents of the asymptotic interaction (10) are canceled
exactly, and Eq. (13) is identical to Eq. (3). This means
that |ΦR∞
(~r, t)i of Eq. (11) factors exactly into a space-
time dependent phase factor and a single-center target
eigenstate |ψR∞(~r, t)i = |ψT (~r, t)i.

The relativistic asymptotic solutions of the form (11)
are exact only in the γ → ∞ limit. For large, ﬁnite γ, the
factored forms are very useful, approximate asymptotic
solutions .

In the derivation reviewed here, the approximation oc-
curs in using Eq. (8) to obtain Eq. (9), and not in the
solution to Eq. (9). The asymptotic distance, Eq. (8), is
accurate in the nonrelativistic limit β2 ≪ 1, γ ≈ 1 [39],
but becomes approximate for larger values of γ, when its
accuracy is of the order γ−2 (see Appendix A).

3. Asymptotic two-center Dirac equation

Here we present an alternative derivation of the fac-
tored asymptotic channel states. Formally, at the asymp-
totic limit, Eq. (6) gives an asymptotic two-center Dirac
equation, (Eq. (15) below), that is exact in the following
sense: it is the rigorous mathematical limit of Eq. (6) as
|t| → ∞. We obtain this exact equation and then solve
it approximately, to order γ−2.

Consider again the case with the electron near to the
target at asymptotic times. In this limit, the electron-
projectile distance is (A10),

lim
|t|→∞

P (~r, t) ≡ r′′∞
r′′

P (~r, t) =

(14)

p

This expression diﬀers from (2) by neglecting the trans-
verse electron coordinate ~r⊥, while the longitudinal co-
ordinate z is retained, since it enters into the Lorentz
transformation (see Appendix A). Using this distance to
obtain the asymptotic limit of the electron-projectile in-
teraction, the asymptotic, two-center Dirac equation in
the target frame is

ˆH ∞

P (t) ≡

−ZP αγ(I4 − β ˇαz)

(16)

For solutions to the asymptotic Dirac equation, Eq.
(15), consider an ansatz which is a product of a space-
time dependent phase factor and a single-center state,

p

|Φ∞

T (~r, t)i = e−iχP (z,t)|ψ∞(~r, t)i ,

Substituting this ansatz into Eq. (15), multiplying from

the transverse direction, the origin of the collider frame
is located equidistant from the target and projectile tra-
jectories (see Fig. 2). The position vector of the electron
in the collider frame is ~r ′
C = ~r ′ = (x′, y′, z′), and the
associated time is t′. Coordinates in the projectile and
target frames are each related to the coordinates in the
collider frame by equal, but oppositely directed, Lorentz
transformations in the z direction,

and,

the asymptotic electron-
The scalar component of
projectile interaction is canceled exactly. The remain-
ing vector component is of order 1/γ2, and vanishes in
the γ → ∞ limit. In this limit, the remaining equation is
identical to the single-center Dirac equation for the target
ion, Eq. (3), and |ψ∞(~r, t)i is therefore a solution to this
single-center equation, |ψ∞(~r, t)i → |ψT (~r, t)i. We con-
clude again that, in the extreme high-energy limit, the so-
lution to the asymptotic, two-center Dirac equation, Eq.
(15), factors exactly into an unperturbed, single-center
target eigenstate, |ψT (~r, t)i, and a space-time dependent
phase factor,

lim
β→1

|Ψ∞

T (~r, t)i = e−iχP (z,t)|ψT (~r, t)i .

(20)

We have discussed two alternative derivations of the
factored forms for the asymptotic solutions for the two-
center Dirac equation and have shown that they provide
identical results in the high-energy limit: Equations (9)
and (15), as well as their respective solutions, Eqs. (11)
and (20), are identical as β → 1. The physical reason for
this is simple. As β → 1, the target atom, as seen from
the projectile, shrinks to a disk, so that the distinction
between the z-coordinate of the nucleus and that of the
electron disappears.

For large, ﬁnite γ, both derivations provide slightly
diﬀerent, but equally useful, approximate solutions ac-
curate to order γ−2. Other equally valid choices of the
argument of the phase factor in Eq. (18) can be made
which diﬀer only in factors of β2 [13,36] (see Appendix
B).

B. Collider frame

For electrons distant from both the target and projec-
tile ion at asymptotic times, the collider (i.e. center-of-
velocity) inertial frame is a natural choice. The origin
of the collider frame is reached from the origin of the
target frame, for example, by an inhomogeneous Lorentz
transformation in the z direction to a frame of velocity
C and Lorentz factor γC =

(γ + 1)/2. In

III. SHORT-RANGE REPRESENTATION

The factored forms of the asymptotic solutions to the
two-center Dirac equation, Eqs. (11,20,41), obtained in
the previous section, invite the deﬁnition of a new rep-
resentation for the time-dependent Dirac equation.
In
this section, we introduce this representation, which we
call the short-range representation, within the context
of computing amplitudes for direct reactions ﬁrst in the
target frame, and then the collider frame.

In nonrelativistic [39] as well as in relativistic colli-
sions [40,41], it has been previously shown to be useful to
introduce a formulation that substitutes the long-range
Coulomb or Li´enard-Wiechert interaction by an eﬀec-
tive short-range interaction, jointly with an appropriate
phase transformation, thus rendering formal scattering
theory applicable. The essence of these approaches has
been to replace the electron-projectile separation for an
electron close to the target and asymptotically far from
the projectile, by the internuclear separation R′′ given by
the expression (8). Then, with an ansatz like Eq. (11),
the approximate asymptotic electron-projectile interac-
tion (10) can be removed completely from the Hamilto-
nian, so that for ﬁnite electron-projectile separations, one
has to deal with a short-range interaction obtained from
the original long-range one by the replacement

We have shown in the previous section and in appendix
A that in the relativistic regime R′′ diﬀers from a more
rigorous asymptotic limit for the electron-projectile sepa-
ration (14) or (A10), by terms of the order of 1/γ2. This
approach revealed that a complete and exact removal of
the asymptotic electron-projectile interaction is possible
only in the β → 1 limit (see Eqs. (19) and (B3)).

For ﬁnite relativistic energies, terms of the order 1/γ2
remain in either the scalar or vector components of the
electron-projectile asymptotic interaction, but are small
for large γ.
In the following, we are concentrating on
the high-energy limit, in which the description becomes
simple and unique.

A. Exact Transition Amplitudes

Following the notation of Ref. [13], let |Ψ(+)

(tf )i be
the exact outgoing-wave solution evolving from an initial
channel solution |Φ∞

j (ti)i, i.e.

j

lim
t→−∞

|Ψ(+)
j

(t)i = |Φ∞

j (t)i ,

(43)

and |Φ∞
k (tf )i be the ﬁnal asymptotic channel. Then, by
deﬁnition, the exact transition amplitude is given in the
post form as

A(+)

kj = lim
tf →∞

hΦ∞

k (tf )|Ψ(+)

j

(tf )i .

(44)

The prior form of the amplitude is deﬁned at t → −∞
as the projection of the exact incoming wave solution

(45)

(46)

The post and prior forms of the amplitude may be
uniﬁed using the time-evolution operator ˆU(tf , ti) to re-
late the full outgoing-wave (incoming-wave) solution to
its initial (ﬁnal) state as

|Ψ(+)
j
|Ψ(−)
k

(tf )i = ˆU (tf , ti)|Φ∞
(ti)i = ˆU †(tf , ti)|Φ∞

j (ti)i

k (tf )i .

Inserting Eqs. (47) into Eq. (44) or Eq. (46), one obtains,

the projectile or collider frame as well.
In direct reac-
tions, the initial and ﬁnal channels in Eq. (48) are both
solutions of the same asymptotic Hamiltonian associated
with a single collision partner (e.g. atomic excitation or
ionization). In rearrangement collisions, the initial and
ﬁnal channels may be solutions of diﬀerent asymptotic
Hamiltonians associated with diﬀerent collision partners
(e.g. charge exchange).

B. Short-range Dirac equation

In this section, we discuss the short-range representa-
tion for the Dirac equation within the context of com-
puting transition amplitudes for direct reactions in the
high-energy limit.

1. Equation of motion: target frame

In the following, we consider the limit β → 1, so that
the asymptotic channels for a target-frame electron in-
teracting with a nearby target ion and a distant projec-
tile ion has the exact, factored solution of Eq. (20). We
substitute this asymptotic solution into the expression
for the exact transition amplitudes for direct reactions in
the target frame, Eq. (48), for the initial state j and ﬁnal
state k,

he−iχP (z,tf )ψ(k)

T (tf )| ˆU (tf , ti)|e−iχP (z,ti)ψ(j)

T (ti)i .

Rearranging the exponential factors in the expression so
that they are applied directly to the evolution operator,
one obtains

(49)

(50)

hψ(k)

T (tf )|e+iχP (z,tf ) ˆU(tf , ti)e−iχP (z,ti)|ψ(j)

T (ti)i .

Akj =

→−∞
ti
tf →∞

Akj =

lim

The transition amplitude, Eq. (50), is suggestive of a
new representation for the dynamics through the opera-
tion of the space-time-dependent phase,

|Ψ(S)(~r, t)i ≡ e+iχP (z,t)|Ψ(~r, t)i ,
ˆU (S)(tf , ti) ≡ e+iχP (z,tf ) ˆU(tf , ti)e−iχP (z,ti) ,

(51)

(52)

(47)

where |Ψ(S)(~r, t)i is the wavefunction, and ˆU (S)(tf , ti) is
the time-evolution operator in the new representation.
Substituting Eq. (52) into Eq. (50) gives the exact am-
plitude for direct reactions in the new representation,

Akj = lim

Reference [13] considered these states in the target iner-
tial frame. Yet, the deﬁnitions presented here apply to

Note that Eq. (53) has the form of a transition amplitude
computed between initial and ﬁnal channels which are

undistorted single-center eigenstates of the target ion, as
would be the case if the interaction between the electron
and the distant projectile was of short range.

To understand better its utility, we transform the two-
center Dirac equation into the short-range representa-
tion. Beginning with Eq. (6), and making the substitu-
tion

|Ψ(~r, t)i = e−iχP (z,t)|Ψ(S)(~r, t)i ,

(54)

gives, after multiplying from the left by e+iχP (z,t), the
equation of motion,

|Ψ(S)(~r, t)i =

where ˆWP (t) is the time-dependent electron-projectile in-
teraction in the new representation [35],

p

ˆWP (t) ≡ ˆHP (t) − ˆH ∞

β→1

(56)

(57)

ˆWP (t) is the original electron-projectile interaction with
its long-range, asymptotic space-time dependence sub-
tracted. The cancellation is exact only in the β → 1
limit. Otherwise, there remains a residual long-range in-
teraction of the order 1/γ2. As a result of this very use-
ful characteristic, we name this new representation the
short-range representation. The phase transformation
used to deﬁne the short-range representation, Eq. (51),
exactly cancels the phase distortion factor contained in
the asymptotic solution to the two-center Dirac equation
in the extreme, high-energy limit, Eq. (20). The result is
a representation of the two-center Dirac equation appro-
priate for direct reactions in extremely relativistic heavy-
ion collisions in which the electron-projectile interaction
has short range and the initial and ﬁnal states are eﬀec-
tively single-center eigenstates of the target ion. (Note
that the transverse-coordinate dependence of ˆWP (t) re-
mains of long-range (i.e. 1/r⊥) form. However, the trans-
verse coordinates do not contribute to the interaction of
the electron with a distant ion at asymptotic times.)

The electron-ion interaction in the short-range repre-
sentation simpliﬁes further if, in addition to the β → 1
limit, one requires that the transverse electron coordi-
nates ~r⊥ and the impact parameter b are small compared
to γ, i.e.

ˆWP (t) = (I4 − ˇαz)ZP αδ(t − z) ln

We refer to this as the sharp limit of the electron-
projectile interaction in the short-range representation,
as the interaction has zero range in the light-front co-
ordinate τ− ≡ (t − z)/2. This behavior reﬂects the fact
that the peak transverse electric ﬁeld produced by a mov-
ing charge increases proportional to γ while the duration
∆t ≈ b/(γβ) of the collision decreases as 1/γ. The in-
teraction in this sharp limit has the character of an elec-
tromagnetic shockfront which develops as the speed of
the source of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, β, approaches the
propagation speed, c, of the ﬁeld [42].

The short-range, two-center Dirac equation, Eq. (55),
in the sharp limit, (i.e. using the interaction in Eq. (59)),
has been recently used by Baltz to compute the high-
energy limit of the impact-parameter dependent proba-
bilities for bound-free electron-positron pair production
in peripheral, relativistic heavy-ion collisions [26]. In re-
ﬂecting on this achievement, it is important to recall that
the derivation of Eq. (55) given here assumes asymp-
totic channels which correspond to direct reactions only.
Asymptotic channels which correspond to the electron
being distant from the target as either ti → −∞ or
tf → +∞ are not considered in this description. As
a result, the charge-transfer mechanism for bound-free
pair production [43,44] is not included in the solutions
given in Ref. [26]. The extreme high-energy behavior of
the charge-transfer mechanism for pair production has
not received detailed study.

An analogous short-range representation may be de-
ﬁned for direct reactions in the projectile frame, with sim-
ilar interpretation. The construction of the short-range
representation in the collider frame is also similar, but
diﬀers in that the asymptotic interaction of the electron
with both projectile and target ions must be considered.
We discuss the collider-frame case in the next section.

2. Equation of motion: collider frame

Consider the extreme, high-energy limit βC → 1 of the
two-center Dirac equation in the collider frame, Eq. (31),
so that the asymptotic channels for an electron interact-
ing with distant target and projectile ions has the fac-
tored form of Eq. (41). We substitute this exact solution
into the expression for the exact transition amplitudes for
the collider frame for the initial state j and ﬁnal state k,

|~r⊥|, b ≪ γ .

The short-range, two-center Dirac equation, Eq. (66), in
the sharp limit (using Eqs. (69)) has recently been used
to compute the high-energy limit of the free electron-
positron pair-production amplitudes in peripheral rela-
tivistic heavy-ion collisions [27–29]. As in the case of the
target frame equation considered previously, the ampli-
tudes derived from Eq. (66) and given in Refs. [27–30]
correspond to direct reactions only. For the present case
in the collider frame, only asymptotic electron states dis-
tant from both target and projectile ions are considered
[45]. The contribution of other asymptotic channels to
the high-energy limit of free-pair production requires fur-
ther investigation.

IV. GAUGE TRANSFORMATIONS

In discussing the two-center Dirac equation in the tar-
get frame, Eq. (6), for relativistic heavy-ion collisions,
Baltz and coworkers have regarded the phase transforma-
tion, Eq. (51), used here to deﬁne the short-range repre-
sentation, as a gauge transformation [36,37,35,26]. Eich-
ler et al. have also remarked that the phase factors ob-
tained in solving for the asymptotic channel solutions of
Eq. (6) and used to obtain a short-range eﬀective interac-
tion can be interpreted as gauge transformations [14,13].
In this section, we show explicitly that the phase trans-
formation used to deﬁne the short-range representation is
equivalent to a gauge transformation, and highlight the
relatedness of these two viewpoints.

In investigating the phase transformation, Eq. (51), as
a gauge transform, it is convenient to write the two-center
Dirac equation explicitly in terms of the electromagnetic
four-vector interaction Aµ. Beginning with Eq. (6), we
write the electron-projectile interaction Hamiltonian as
ˆHP (t) = A0 − ˇαzAz, where

A0(~r, t) ≡

−ZP αγ
r′′
P (~r, t)

,

Az(~r, t) ≡ βA0(~r, t) ,

gauge transformation considered in deﬁning the short-
range representation modiﬁes the asymptotic states since
it behaves asymptotically as

We now re-derive the two-center Dirac equation in the
short-range representation, Eq. (55), by substituting the
phase transformation in Eq. (51) into Eq. (71) and mul-
tiplying from the left by e−iχP , to obtain

With the interaction written in the form of Eqs. (73), the
phase transformation in Eq. (51) clearly accomplishes a
gauge transformation.

such as the S-matrix amplitudes,

In general, gauge transformations leave physical quan-
invariant,
tities,
whereas other quantities, such as wavefunctions, propa-
gators, and asymptotic channel solutions, may depend on
the gauge. Clearly, the invariance of physical quantities
relies on an exact formulation. From a practical point
of view, however, approximations are often needed. A
widely applied method consists in the expansion of the
time-dependent wave function in terms of a basis set of
channel functions, such that the time dependent Dirac
equation (6) is equivalent to an inﬁnite set of coupled
equations for the time-dependent expansion coeﬃcients.
For practical reasons, this set is truncated at a ﬁnite num-
ber of states. While the complete set is, of course, invari-
ant under gauge transformations, a ﬁnite set usually is
not. In fact, a gauge transformation may not only mod-
ify the eﬀective interaction, but it also aﬀects the con-
vergence property of the expansion [46]. Therefore, both
eﬀects should always be considered simultaneously and,
actually, can be utilized to speed up convergence [41].

Within an exact treatment, which is our main subject,
a distinction has been made in Refs. [36,47,48] between
gauge transformations which leave the asymptotic chan-
nels invariant (or trivially modiﬁed) as a result of the
gauge function being constant at asymptotic times, and
those which modify boundary conditions since the gauge
Indeed, the
function is not constant asymptotically.

Implicit in using the short-range representation (or
gauge) in the high-energy limit is that the phase trans-
formation, Eq. (51), deﬁning the representation, exactly
cancels the phase distortion of the asymptotic channels
induced by the distant projectile ion (see Eq. (20)). As
a result, the asymptotic channel solutions for direct re-
actions in the short-range representation are the undis-
torted, single-center atomic states, |ψj(~r, t)i.
In other
words, by using undistorted atomic states as asymptotic
channels in the short-range representation, as was done
in Ref. [26], one is, in eﬀect, using the factored form for
the asymptotic channel solutions, Eq. (20), of Eichler and
coworkers.

V. CONCLUSIONS

A primary goal of this work was to place on a clear
and ﬁrm theoretical foundation the “Sharp Dirac equa-
tion”, i.e. the two-center Dirac equation(s), in both the
target and the collider frames, in the short-range repre-
sentation, in the extreme relativistic (sharp) limit. The
reason this is of primary importance is that the extreme
relativistic limit of the two-center Dirac equation in the
short-range representation for heavy-ion collisions sim-
pliﬁes remarkably, and allows for closed form solutions
for pair-production amplitudes in this limit.

With these goals in mind, we have described the
relationship between asymptotic solutions to the two-
center, time-dependent Dirac equation for a single elec-
tron in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and
phase (or gauge) transformations designed to remove
the long-range asymptotic interaction from the equation
of motion. Direct reactions are central to the discus-
sion. “Charge-transfer” mechanisms for pair production
[43,44] have been omitted here, and should be subse-
quently considered in the high-energy limit.

We have shown that the asymptotic channel solutions
factorize into a space-time dependent phase and an eigen-
state of the appropriate time-independent Hamiltonian,
in the limit β → 1. For collision velocities less than
the speed of light, this factorization is approximate with
accuracy of the order 1/γ2. We have also shown that
as a result of this factorization a gauge transformation
may be performed to a new representation in which the
asymptotic dynamics are included in the states. In this
representation, the asymptotic interaction between the
electron and a distant ion is of short-range form, and

9

the asymptotic solutions are undistorted, stationary so-
lutions of a time-independent Hamiltonian. Under such
conditions, a formally correct formulation of scattering
theory may be constructed. In addition, this short-range
representation has advantages for the convergence of nu-
merical calculations [40,41,36,37,49].

The factorization of the asymptotic solutions in the
β → 1 limit also provides a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation in
the dynamics. A further simpliﬁcation is achieved if the
magnitude of the transverse coordinate, r⊥, and the im-
pact parameter, b, are constrained to be much smaller
than γ. In this limit, the time-dependent interaction fac-
tors into a logarithmic function of the transverse coordi-
nate, and a Dirac-delta function of a light-front variable,
τ± = (z ± t)/2, describing an electromagnetic shock on
the lightfront [34,35,27]. The identiﬁcation of the sep-
arable form has allowed for the closed-form solution of
amplitudes for electron-positron pair production in the
high-energy limit of heavy-ion collisions [26–29].

We have also made a connection with the previous pio-
neering work of Eichler et al. on the Coulomb-boundary
conditions. We have elucidated and discussed the re-
latedness of the Coulomb-boundary approach and what
Baltz and coworkers have recently accomplished via the
machinery of gauge-transformations. We have shown
that in the high energy limit, these two approaches are
in agreement, and diﬀer mostly in their language.

The replacement strategy previously developed by
Eichler and coworkers was designed to remove the long-
range part by a gauge or phase transformation. This
treatment is fully symmetric with respect to the target
and projectile frame, has the correct nonrelativistic limit
and has been successful in a number of calculations. We
note however, that there is no unique way to derive “re-
placements”. When the purpose is to have a good basis-
set for numerical calculation, a replacement procedure is
a useful and adequate approximation. On the other hand,
if one is treating the problem in a formal approach, as
was recently done for the high-energy collision limit in
Refs. [26–29], the rigorous deﬁnition of the short-range
representation as presented here is of signiﬁcant impor-
tance.

In regard to using the factored solution as an accurate,
but approximate, asymptotic channel solution for calcu-
lation of high-energy collision phenomena, one should
keep in mind that the factored solution, e.g. the phase
factor times a single-center eigenstate, is an exact solu-
tion to the two-center Dirac equation for asymptotically
large times, only in the limit β → 1. For large, but ﬁ-
nite γ, the factored solution is an approximate solution
to the asymptotic Dirac equation accurate to order 1/γ2.
Hence, choosing between factors of β in the argument of
the phase is largely a matter of personal taste.

where {~r ′′
ordinates of the electron in the projectile frame and in
the target frame, respectively, which are related by an in-
homogeneous Lorentz transformation as in Eqs. (1). We
would like to obtain an asymptotic (i.e.
|t| → ∞) limit
for r′′

P when the internuclear separation R′′,

R′′(t′′) =

is large compared to the separations between the electron
and the target.

We now discuss the problem of

the asymptotic

electron-projectile separation in two diﬀerent versions.

a. Internuclear separation

Following the arguments given in Refs. [13,14], we sub-
stitute the internuclear separation R′′ for the asymptotic
electron-projectile separation, which should be a good
approximation for very large positive or negative times.
Formally, this corresponds to taking

~r⊥ → 0 , z → 0

(A4)

in the target frame. Once this replacement is performed,
we consider R′′ as a parameter of the system describing
the internuclear motion and no longer the position of the
electron, that is, we leave the Lorentz transformation,

t′′ = γ(t − βz) ,

(A5)

10

relating the projectile-frame time to the target-frame
time for an arbitrary electron position, intact. This con-
stitutes an inconsistency, if the position of the target nu-
cleus with respect to the projectile nucleus is interpreted
as an electronic position with the coordinates (A4). In
this respect, the replacement ~r ′′
P → R′′ with R′′ given by
Eqs. (A3) and (A5), i.e.

r′′
P →

b2 + γ2 (β2z − βt)2

(A6)

q

is not the formally derivable asymptotic limit. According
to Eq. (A4), formal consistency can only be achieved by
replacing t′′ → γt, i.e.

r′′
P →

b2 + γ2β2t2 .

(A7)

p

However, Eq. (A7) is not useful for our purpose, because
the z-dependence is required to describe the magnetic
component of the electromagnetic interaction at asymp-
totic times for large γ [40].

In the nonrelativistic limit β2 ≪ 1, γ ≈ 1, when t′′ ≈ t,
no inconsistency occurs, and Eqs. (A3) or (A6) immedi-
ately lead to the usual and successfully applied replace-
ment [39]

~rP → R =

b2 + β2t2.

(A8)

p

b. Longitudinal electron-projectile separation

To obtain a formally rigorous z dependence for the
asymptotic limit of the electron-projectile distance r′′
P for
an electron near to the target but distant from the pro-
jectile, one should not use ~r ′′
P → R′′, but should maintain
the dependence on the z coordinate, that is, retain the
exact longitudinal electron-projectile distance. Even if
|z| ≪ β|t| in the laboratory at asymptotic times, we do
not set it to zero. This means that instead of Eq. (A4),
we take

~r⊥ → 0 ,

(A9)

while z is retained. This procedure guarantees that
Lorentz transformations can be consistently applied.
The resulting, formally correct asymptotic limit of the
electron-projectile distance is

taking the longitudinal electron-projectile separation and
the internuclear separation. One sees this diﬀerence more
P /R′′ in the limit γ ≫
explicitly by considering the ratio r′′
1, |z| ≪ β|t|, and b ≪ γ|t|. Keeping terms proportional
to z/t, we obtain

r′′
P
R′′ ≈ 1 −

z
γ2t

.

(A12)

Indeed, for very large values of γ, the target atom as
seen from the projectile shrinks to a disk, so that the
electronic z-coordinate almost coincides with the z = 0
coordinate of an electron located at the target nucleus.

We here have discussed two diﬀerent approaches for
identifying the asymptotic electron-projectile separation.
The ﬁrst is based on a substitution by the internuclear
separation, which implies a formal inconsistency if inter-
preted as a true electronic separation instead of a parame-
ter describing the projectile motion. However, it appears
physically reasonable and has the correct nonrelativis-
tic limit. The second is formally rigorously derivable by
keeping the longitudinal electronic coordinate and hence
encounters no problems when applying Lorentz transfor-
mations in a straightforward fashion. Both approaches
diﬀer in a term of the order of 1/γ2 in the asymptotic
electron-projectile separation and agree for β → 1. As
discussed in Sec. II A and in Appendix B, discrepancies
of this order propagate into the factored forms of the
asymptotic channel solutions and the asymptotic inter-
action when they are applied for large, but ﬁnite, γ.

APPENDIX B: PHASE CHOICES FOR
ASYMPTOTIC CHANNELS

In Sec. II A, we have discussed two versions , Eqs. (11)
and (17), for separating asymptotic wave functions by in-
troducing the phases (12) and (18), respectively. These
phases, diﬀering only in factors β2, arise from diﬀerent
choices for the asymptotic electron-ion distance (see Ap-
pendix A). For our present purposes, choosing among
these diﬀerent phase arguments is largely a matter of
personal taste since only in the γ → ∞ limit does the
asymptotic interaction vanish exactly in the short-range
representation. For large ﬁnite values of γ, terms of the
order of 1/γ2 remain. In order to illustrate the conse-
quences of phase choices, consider yet another product
ansatz for the solution of the asymptotic two-center Dirac
equation in the target frame,

|Φ∞

T (~r, t)i = e−iΛP (z,t)|ψT (~r, t)i ,

This, no doubt, is a better approximation to Eq. (A2)
than ~r ′′
P → R′′. In order to compare it with Eq. (A6),
we may write

where

P (~r, t) =

b2 + γ2 [(γ−2 + β2)z − βt]2 .

(A11)

Note that, compared to Eq. (A6), an additional term with
1/γ2 appears. This term reﬂects the diﬀerence between

Substituting this ansatz into Eq. (15), multiplying from
the left by eiΛT (z,t), and collecting like terms gives

With the phase choice in Eq. (B2), the vector compo-
nent of the asymptotic electron-projectile interaction is
canceled exactly, and the remaining scalar component is
of the order 1/γ2.
In contrast, with the phase choice
made in Eq. (18), which diﬀers from Eq. (B2) only by a
factor of β2, the scalar component cancels exactly, and
the vector component is of order 1/γ2.

One may always perform a gauge transformation such
that a single component (or a single linear combination of
components) of the four-vector electromagnetic interac-
tion is exactly zero for all times. Such a gauge condition
is known as an axial gauge (see Refs. [15,50]). The nov-
elty of the short-range representation in the β → 1 limit
is that in it the full, asymptotic interaction (both scalar
and vector components) is zero.

“oﬀ the lightfronts”, and in Ref. [28] by considering only
“centrally produced” electrons and positrons. These two
restrictions, as discussed in the references, possess the
same basic physical content.

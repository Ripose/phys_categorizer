The ground and a few excited states of the beryllium atom

in external uniform magnetic ﬁelds are calculated by means

of our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method for ﬁeld strengths rang-
ing from zero up to 2.35 · 109T. With changing ﬁeld strength

the ground state of the Be atom undergoes three transitions

involving four diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations which belong

to three groups with diﬀerent spin projections Sz = 0, −1, −2.

For weak ﬁelds the ground state conﬁguration arises from the
1s22s2, Sz = 0 conﬁguration. With increasing ﬁeld strength

the ground state evolves into the two Sz = −1 conﬁgurations
1s22s2p−1 and 1s22p−13d−2, followed by the fully spin po-

larised Sz = −2 conﬁguration 1s2p−13d−24f−3. The latter

conﬁguration forms the ground state of the beryllium atom

in the high ﬁeld regime γ > 4.567. The analogous calculations
for the Be+ ion provide the sequence of the three following
ground state conﬁgurations: 1s22s and 1s22p−1 (Sz = −1/2)

and 1s2p−13d−2 (Sz = −3/2).

I. INTRODUCTION

The behaviour and properties of atoms in strong mag-
netic ﬁelds is a subject of increasing interest. This is
motivated by the astrophysical discovery of strong ﬁelds

on white dwarfs and neutron stars [1–3]. On the other
hand the competition of the diamagnetic and Coulomb
interaction causes a rich variety of complex properties
which are, of course, also of interest on their own.

For a long time the investigations in the literature fo-
cused on the hydrogen atom (for a list of references see,
for example, [4–7]). As a result of the corresponding in-
vestigations the absorption features of certain magnetic
white dwarfs could be understood in detail and a mod-

elling of their atmospheres was possible (see ref. [8] for a
review up to 1994 and [9] for more recent references). De-
tailed spectroscopic calculations were carried out recently

for the helium atom in strong magnetic ﬁelds [10]. These

calculations allow to identify spectra of other, namely
helium-rich objects, including the prominent white dwarf
GD229 [11]. Recently a number of new magnetic white
dwarfs have been found whose spectra are still unex-
plained (see, e.g., Reimers et al [12] in the course of the
Hamburg ESO survey).

Investigations on the electronic structure in the pres-
ence of a magnetic ﬁeld appear to be quite complicated
due to the intricate geometry of this quantum prob-

lem. For the hydrogen atom the impact of the com-
peting Coulomb and diamagnetic interaction is particu-
larly evident and pronounced in the intermediate regime
for which the magnetic and Coulomb forces are compa-
rable. For diﬀerent electronic degrees of excitation of
the atom the intermediate regime is met for diﬀerent
absolute values of the ﬁeld strength. For the ground
state this regime corresponds to ﬁeld strengths around

γ = 1 (for the magnetic ﬁeld strength as well as for
other physical values we use atomic units and, in partic-
ular, γ = B/B0, B0 corresponds to the magnetic ﬁeld
strength B0 = ¯hc/ea2
0 = 2.3505·105T). Both early [13,14]
and more recent works [4,15] on the hydrogen atom have
used diﬀerent approaches for relatively weak ﬁelds (the
Coulomb force prevails over the magnetic force) and for
very strong ﬁelds (the Coulomb force can be considered
as weak in comparison with the magnetic forces which is

the so-called adiabatic regime). A powerful method to
obtain comprehensive results on low-lying energy levels
of the hydrogen atom in particular in the intermediate
regime is provided by mesh methods [5]. For atoms with
several electrons there are two decisive factors which en-
rich the possible changes in the electronic structure with
varying ﬁeld strength compared to the one-electron sys-
tem. First we have a third competing interaction which

is the electron-electron repulsion and second the diﬀer-

1

ent electrons feel very diﬀerent Coulomb forces, i.e. pos-
sess diﬀerent one particle energies, and consequently the
regime of the intermediate ﬁeld strengths appears to be
the sum of the intermediate regimes for the separate elec-
trons.

Opposite to the hydrogen atom the wavefunctions of
the multi-electron atoms change their symmetries with
increasing ﬁeld strength. It is well known that the sin-
glet zero-ﬁeld ground state of the helium atom (1s2 in
the Hartree-Fock language) is replaced in the high-ﬁeld
regime by the triplet fully spin polarised conﬁguration
1s2p−1. For atoms with more than two electrons the
evolution of the ground state within the whole range of

ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ γ < +∞ includes multiple intermedi-
ate conﬁgurations besides the zero-ﬁeld ground state and
the ground state corresponding to the high ﬁeld limit. In
view of the above there is a need for further quantum
mechanical investigations and data on atoms with more
than two electrons in order to understand their electronic
structure in strong magnetic ﬁelds. Our calculations al-
lowed us to obtain the ﬁrst conclusive results on the series
of ground state conﬁgurations for the Li [16] and C [17]

atoms. These results are substantially diﬀerent from pre-
viously published ones [18]. The ground state electronic
conﬁgurations of the beryllium atom for 0 ≤ γ < +∞
were not investigated so far. A previous work on the
beryllium atom [19] focused on problems associated with
the symmetries of the Hartree-Fock wavefunction of the
low-ﬁeld ground state 1s22s2 of this atom. For strong
ﬁelds the 1s22s2 state represents a highly excited state
and the electronic ground state conﬁguration of Be is, so
far, not investigated.

In the current paper we present results of our fully nu-
merical 2D Hartree-Fock mesh calculations of the beryl-
lium atom and Be+ ion in magnetic ﬁelds and obtain for
the ﬁrst time conclusive results on the structure and en-
ergy of the ground state conﬁgurations of these systems
for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths.

II. METHOD

The computational method applied in the current
work coincides with the method described in our works

[5,19–22] and applied afterwards in [16,17,23,24]. We

solve the electronic Schr¨odinger equation for the beryl-
lium atom in a magnetic ﬁeld under the assumption of
an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus in the (unrestricted) Hartree-
Fock (HF) approximation. The solution is established in
the cylindrical coordinate system (ρ, φ, z) with the z-axis

oriented along the magnetic ﬁeld. We prescribe to each
electron a deﬁnite value of the magnetic quantum num-
ber mµ. Each one-electron wave function Ψµ depends on
the variables φ and (ρ, z)

Ψµ(ρ, φ, z) = (2π)−1/2e−imµφψµ(z, ρ)

(1)

where µ indicates the numbering of the electrons. The re-
sulting partial diﬀerential equations for ψµ(z, ρ) and the
formulae for the Coulomb and exchange potentials have

been presented in ref. [21]. These equations as well as
the Poisson equations for inter-electronic Coulomb and
exchange potentials are solved by means of the fully nu-
merical mesh method described in refs. [5,21]. The ﬁnite-
diﬀerence solution of the Poisson equations on sets of
nodes coinciding with those of the Hartree-Fock equa-
tions turns out to be possible due to a special form of
uniform meshes used in the present calculations and in
refs. [16,17,19]. Details and discussion on these meshes

are presented in ref. [25].

Our mesh approach is ﬂexible enough to yield precise
results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. Some minor decrease
of the precision appears for electronic conﬁgurations with
big diﬀerences in the spatial distribution of the electronic
density for diﬀerent electrons. This results in big diﬀer-
ences with respect to the spatial extension of the density
distribution for diﬀerent electrons. This situation is more

typical for the electronic conﬁgurations which do not rep-
resent the ground state at the corresponding ﬁelds (e.g.
1s22s2 at very strong ﬁelds or 1s2p−13d−24f−3 in the
weak ﬁeld regime). The precision of our results depends,
of course, on the number of mesh nodes and can be al-
ways improved in calculations with denser meshes. Most
of the present calculations are carried out on sequences of
meshes with the maximal number of nodes being 80 × 80.
Along with the numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger

equation the key element for solving the problem of the
ground state electronic conﬁgurations is a proper choice
of the conﬁgurations, which could potentially be the
ground state ones. An example of solving this problem
is presented in [17]. In that work we have developed a

2

strategy which enables one to reduce the set of possi-
ble ground state conﬁgurations which are then subject
to a following numerical investigation. This removes the
risk of missing some ground state conﬁgurations due to
the limited possibilities of performing numerical investi-

gations. With increasing number of electrons the number
of conﬁgurations which cannot a priori be excluded from
becoming the ground state increase rapidly. A compre-
hensive numerical investigation of all these conﬁgurations
is, in general, not feasible. The above-mentioned strat-
egy to exclude certain conﬁgurations is therefore highly
desirable.
It is based on a combination of qualitative
theoretical arguments and numerical calculations of the

energies of electronic conﬁgurations. As a ﬁrst step the
set of electronic conﬁgurations has to be separated into
several groups according to their spin projections Sz.
The following considerations have to be carried out in
each subset separately, and are certainly more transpar-
ent by starting with the limit of inﬁnite strong ﬁelds and
analysing the electronic conﬁgurations with decreasing
ﬁeld strengths. The qualitative theoretical considerations
mentioned above are based on the geometry of the spa-

tial part of the wavefunction and enable one to determine
the ground state for the high-ﬁeld limit as well as several
candidates for the ground state conﬁguration with de-
creasing ﬁeld strength. The numerical calculations then
enable us to decide which of these candidates becomes
the actual ﬁrst intermediate ground state and yields the
transition ﬁeld strength. The knowledge of the ﬁrst inter-
mediate ground state allows us to repeat the qualitative

considerations for the second intermediate ground state
to obtain a list of candidates which is then investigated
by means of numerical calculations. Repeating this pro-
cedure one can determine the full sequence of the ground
state conﬁgurations for each subset Sz and ﬁnally the
sequence of ground state conﬁgurations for the physical
system.

III. GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC

CONFIGURATIONS FOR γ = 0 AND γ → ∞

In this section we provide some helpful qualitative con-
siderations on the problem of the atomic multi-electron
ground states particularly in the limit of strong magnetic

ﬁelds.

For the case γ = 0 the ground state conﬁguration of the
beryllium atom can be characterised as 1s22s2. This no-
tation has a literal meaning when considering the atom in
the framework of the restricted Hartree-Fock approach.

The latter is an approximation of limited quality in de-
scribing the beryllium atom as it was shown in many fully
correlated calculations both for the ﬁeld-free Be atom
[26,27] and for its polarizabilities in electric ﬁelds [28,29].
It was pointed out in these works that the Be atom is a
strongly correlated system and that the HF ground state
wavefunction (i. e. the spherically symmetric 1s22s2) is
not a very accurate zeroth-order wavefunction, especially

for calculations of electric polarizabilities. This is due to
a signiﬁcant contribution of the 1s22p2 conﬁguration to
the ground state wave function. The latter conﬁguration
is evidently a non-spherical one. This fact is in agree-
ment with results of ref. [19] where the fully numerical
2D unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach provides the 2s2
shell stretched along the z axis even for γ = 0. In terms
of spherical functions it is natural to describe this geom-
etry of the 2s2 shell as a mixture of 2s and 2p0 functions.
We remark that the s, p, d . . . orbital notation both for
γ = 0 and γ 6= 0 is based on the behaviour of the wave
functions in the vicinity of the origin and on the topol-
ogy of the nodal surfaces, but does not imply any detailed
geometry or certain values of the orbital moment l.

It is evident that the ﬁeld-free ground state of the
beryllium atom remains the ground state only for rela-
tively weak ﬁelds. The set of one-electron wave functions

constituting the HF ground state for the opposite case
of extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds can be determined as
follows. The nuclear attraction energies and HF poten-
tials (which determine the motion along z axis) are small
for large γ in comparison to the interaction energies with
the magnetic ﬁeld (which determines the motion perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and is responsible for the
Landau zonal structure of the spectrum). Thus, all the
one-electron wavefunctions must correspond to the low-

est Landau zones, i.e. the magnetic quantum numbers
mµ are not postive for all the electrons mµ ≤ 0, and the
system must be fully spin-polarised, i.e. szµ = − 1
2 . For
the Coulomb central ﬁeld the one-electron levels form (as
B → ∞) quasi 1D Coulomb series with the binding en-

3

z

ergy ǫB = 1
for nz > 0 and ǫB → ∞ for nz = 0,
2n2
where nz is the number of nodal surfaces of the wave
function with respect to the z axis. The binding energy
of a separate electron has the form

ǫB = (m + |m| + 2sz + 1)γ/2 − ǫ

(2)

where ǫ is the energy of the electron.

When considering the case γ → ∞ it is evident, that
the wave functions with nz = 0 have to be chosen for the
ground state conﬁguration. Furthermore starting with
the energetically lowest one particle level the electrons
occupy according to the above arguments orbitals with
increasing absolute value of the magnetic quantum num-
ber mµ. Consequently the ground state of the beryllium
atom must be given by the fully spin-polarised conﬁgu-
ration 1s2p−13d−24f−3. In our notation of the electronic
conﬁgurations we assume in the following that all paired
electrons, like for example the 1s2 part of a conﬁguration,
are of course in a spin up and spin down orbital, respec-
tively, whereas all unpaired electrons possess a negative
projection of the spin onto the magnetic ﬁeld direction.
On a qualitative level the conﬁguration 1s2p−13d−24f−3

is not very diﬀerent from similar electronic conﬁgurations
for other atoms (see ref. [24]). This is a manifestation of
the simpliﬁcation of the picture of atomic properties in
the limit γ → ∞ where a linear sequence of electronic
conﬁgurations replaces the periodic table of elements of
the ﬁeld-free case.

The problem of the conﬁgurations of the ground state
for the intermediate ﬁeld region cannot be solved without
doing explicit calculations combined with some qualita-

tive considerations in order to extract the relevant con-
ﬁgurations.

IV. GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC

CONFIGURATIONS FOR ARBITRARY FIELD

STRENGTHS

In order to determine the ground state electronic con-
ﬁgurations of the beryllium atom we employ here the
strategy introduced in ref. [17] where the carbon atom
has been investigated. First of all, we divide the possible

ground state conﬁgurations into three groups according

to their total spin projection Sz : the Sz = 0 group (low-
ﬁeld ground state conﬁgurations), the intermediate group
Sz = −1 and the Sz = −2 group (the high-ﬁeld ground
state conﬁgurations). This grouping is required for the
following qualitative considerations which are based on

the geometry of the spatial parts of the one-electron wave
functions. In the course of this discussion it is expedi-
ent to treat local ground states for each Sz subset (i.e.
the lowest states with a certain Sz value) along with the
global ground state of the atom as a whole. For each value
of the magnetic ﬁeld strength one of these local ground
states is the global ground state of the atom.

According to the general arguments presented in the

previous section we know that the ground state conﬁgu-
ration of the beryllium atom in the high ﬁeld limit must
be the fully spin-polarised state 1s2p−13d−24f−3. The
question of the ground state conﬁgurations at interme-
diate ﬁelds cannot be solved without performing explicit
electronic structure calculations. On the other hand, the
a priori set of possible intermediate ground state con-
ﬁgurations increases enormously with increasing number
of electrons and is rather large already for the beryl-

lium atom. Some qualitative considerations are there-
fore needed in order to exclude certain conﬁgurations as
possible ground state conﬁgurations thereby reducing the
number of candidates for which explicit calculations have
to be performed. As mentioned in the previous section
the optimal strategy hereby consists of the repeated pro-
cedure of determining neighbouring ground state conﬁg-
urations with increasing (or decreasing) magnetic ﬁeld

strength using both qualitative arguments as well as the
results of the calculations for concrete conﬁgurations.

The total energies for the considered states and par-
ticularly of those states which become the global ground
state of the atom for some regime of the ﬁeld strength
are illustrated in ﬁgure 1. In the following paragraphs we
describe our sequence of selection procedure and calcu-
lations for the candidates of the electronic ground state
conﬁgurations.

Due to the simplicity of the ground state electronic
conﬁgurations of atoms in the limit γ → ∞ it is natural
to start the consideration for γ 6= 0 with the high-ﬁeld
ground state and then consider other possible candidates
in question for the electronic ground state for Sz = −2

4

(see ﬁgure 1) with decreasing ﬁeld strength. The con-
sideration of the high-ﬁeld (i.e. the fully spin-polarised)
regime was carried out in ref. [24] and for this case (i.e.
Sz = −2 for beryllium) we repeat this consideration in
more detail. In particular, we have found in ref. [24] that

the beryllium atom, opposite to the carbon and heavier
elements has only one fully spin-polarised ground state
conﬁguration.

All the one electron wave functions of the high-ﬁeld
ground state 1s2p−13d−24f−3 possess no nodal surfaces
crossing the z-axis and occupy the energetically lowest
orbitals with magnetic quantum numbers ranging from
m = 0 down to m = −3. The 4f−3 orbital possesses

the smallest binding energy of all orbitals constituting
the high-ﬁeld ground state. Its binding energy decreases
rapidly with decreasing ﬁeld strength. Thus, we can
expect that the ﬁrst crossover of ground state conﬁg-
urations happens due to a change of the 4f−3 orbital
into one possessing a higher binding energy at the cor-
responding lowered ﬁeld strength. One may think that
the ﬁrst transition while decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld
strength will involve a transition from an orbital possess-
ing nz = 0 to one for nz = 1. The energetically lowest
available one particle state with nz = 1 is the 2p0 or-
bital. Another possible orbital into which the 4f−3 wave
function could evolve is the 2s state. For the hydro-
gen atom or hydrogen-like ions in a magnetic ﬁeld the
2p0 is stronger bound than the 2s orbital. On the other
hand, owing to the electron screening in multi-electron
atoms in ﬁeld-free space the 2s orbital tends to be more

tightly bound than the 2p0 orbital. Thus, two states i.e.
1s2p02p−13d−2 and 1s2s2p−13d−2 are candidates for be-
coming the ground state in the Sz = −2 set when we
lower the ﬁeld strength coming from the high ﬁeld sit-
uation. The numerical calculations show that the ﬁrst
crossover of the Sz = −2 subset takes place between the
1s2p−13d−24f−3 and 1s2p02p−13d−2 conﬁgurations (ﬁg-
ure 1). On the other hand, the calculations show that
even earlier (i.e. at higher magnetic ﬁeld strengths) the
global ground state acquires the total spin Sz = −1 due
to a crossover of the energy curve of the 1s2p−13d−24f−3
conﬁguration with that of the conﬁguration 1s22p−13d−2
(which is the local ground state for the Sz = −1 subset
in the high-ﬁeld limit). For the ﬁelds below this point

The

electronic

γ = 4.567 the ground state electronic conﬁgurations of
the beryllium atom belong to the subset Sz = −1. This
means that the beryllium atom has only one fully spin po-
larised ground state conﬁguration (as mentioned above).
conﬁgurations
1s22p−13d−2 and 1s2p−13d−24f−3 diﬀer by the replace-
ment of the spin down 4f−3 orbital through the spin up 1s
orbital and according to the argumentation presented in
the previous section the 1s22p−13d−2 represents the local
ground state conﬁguration for the subset Sz = −1 in the
limit γ → ∞. Analogous arguments to that presented in
the previous paragraph provide the conclusion, that in
the process of decreasing ﬁeld strength the 1s22p−13d−2
ground state electronic conﬁguration can be replaced ei-
ther by the 1s22s2p−1 or by the 1s22p02p−1 conﬁgura-
tion. The numerical calculations show, that the curve
E1s2 2s2p−1 (γ) intersects the curve E1s2 2p−1 3d−2(γ) at a
higher magnetic ﬁeld (γ = 0.957) than E1s2 2p0 2p−1 (γ)
crosses E1s2 2p−13d−2(γ). The diﬀerence with respect to
the order of the local ground state conﬁgurations in the
subsets Sz = −2 and Sz = −1 stems from the diﬀer-
ence in the magnetic ﬁeld strengths characteristic for the

crossovers in these subsets. At moderate ﬁeld strengths
(Sz = −1) the inﬂuence of the Coulomb ﬁelds of the
nucleus and electrons prevails over the inﬂuence of the
magnetic ﬁeld and make the energy of the 2s orbital
lower than that of the 2p0 orbital. On the other hand,
at stronger ﬁelds characteristic for the subset Sz = −2
the energies of these orbitals are governed mostly by the
magnetic ﬁeld and, in result, the energy of the 2p0 orbital

becomes lower than the energy of the 2s orbital.

for γ → 0.

From our simple qualitative considerations we can
conclude, that the conﬁguration 1s22s2p−1 is the local
ground state conﬁguration of the subset Sz = −1 for
the weak ﬁeld case, i.e.
Indeed, when we
construct such a conﬁguration, the ﬁrst three electrons
go to orbitals 1s and 2s forming the 1s22s conﬁguration
with Sz = −1/2. The fourth electron must then have the
same spin as the 2s orbital electron to obtain the total
spin value Sz = −1. Thus, the lowest orbital which it can
occupy is the 2p−1. Therefore, there are two local ground
state conﬁgurations in the subset Sz = −1 and they both
represent the global ground state for some ranges of the
magnetic ﬁeld strengths.

5

The necessary considerations for the subset Sz = 0
are quite simple. At γ = 0 and, evidently, for very weak
ﬁelds the ground state of the beryllium atom has the con-
ﬁguration 1s22s2. We can expect, that when increasing
the magnetic ﬁeld strength, the next lowest state with
Sz = 0 will be the 1s22s2p−1 conﬁguration with oppo-
site directions of the spins of the 2s and 2p−1 electrons.
But both contributions, the Zeeman spin term and the
electronic exchange make the energy of this state higher
than the energy of the state 1s22s2p−1 with the parallel
orientation of the spins of the 2s and 2p−1 electrons (i.e.
Sz = −1) considered above. The calculated energies for
these states are presented in ﬁgure 1. Thus, the beryl-

lium atom has one ground state electronic conﬁguration
1s22s2 with the total spin z-projection Sz = 0. This
state is the global ground state for the magnetic ﬁeld
strengths between γ = 0 and γ = 0.0412. Above this
point the ground state conﬁguration is 1s22s2p−1 with
Sz = −1.

Summarising the results on the ground state conﬁg-
urations of the beryllium atom we can state that de-
pending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength this atom has

four diﬀerent electronic ground state conﬁgurations. For
0 ≤ γ < 0.0412 the ground state conﬁguration coin-
cides with the ﬁeld-free ground state conﬁguration 1s22s2
which has zero values for the total magnetic quantum
number M and spin projection Sz. The following are two
ground state conﬁgurations with Sz = −1: 1s22s2p−1
(M = −1) for 0.0412 < γ < 0.957 and 1s22p−13d−2
(M = −3) for 0.957 < γ < 4.567. For γ > 4.567

the ground state conﬁguration is 1s2p−13d−24f−3 with
Sz = −2 and M = −6. The complete results of the
investigations of the sequence of the ground state conﬁg-
urations of the Be atom are presented in table I which
contains the critical values of γ at which the crossovers
of diﬀerent ground state conﬁgurations take place.

The next aim of this section is the corresponding inves-
tigation of the ground state conﬁgurations of the ion Be+.
The ﬁeld-free ground state of this ion corresponds to the
1s22s conﬁguration (Sz = −1/2 and M = 0). In the op-
posite case γ → ∞ the ground state is obviously given by
the 1s2p−13d−2 conﬁguration (Sz = −3/2 and M = −3).
Thus, we need to investigate only two diﬀerent subsets
of electronic ground state conﬁgurations: Sz = −1/2 and

Sz = −3/2. The energy curves which are necessary for
this investigation are presented in ﬁgure 2. The subset
Sz = −1/2 contains only two possible ground state con-
ﬁgurations 1s22s and 1s22p−1. The latter is the local
ground state conﬁguration for this subset in the limit
γ → ∞. The curves E1s2 2s(γ) and E1s2 2p−1 (γ) intersect
at γ = 0.3185 and above this point E1s2 2p−1 < E1s2 2s. In
the subset Sz = −3/2 we have to consider the conﬁgura-
tions 1s2p02p−1 and 1s2s2p−1 along with the high-ﬁeld
ground state conﬁguration 1s2p−13d−2. But the numeri-
cal calculations show that the energies of both 1s2p02p−1
and 1s2s2p−1 lie above the energy of the 1s2p−13d−2 con-
ﬁguration at the intersection point (γ = 4.501) between
E1s2p−1 3d−2(γ) and E1s2 2p−1 (γ). Thus, the ion Be+ has
three diﬀerent electronic ground state conﬁgurations in
external magnetic ﬁelds: for 0 ≤ γ < 0.3185 it is 1s22s
(Sz = −1/2 and M = 0), then for 0.38483 < γ < 4.501
it is 1s22p−1 (Sz = −1/2 and M = −1) and for all
the values γ > 4.501 the ground state conﬁguration is
1s2p−13d−2 (Sz = −3/2 and M = −3). These results
are summarised in table II. The set of the electronic
ground state conﬁgurations for the Be+ ion appears to be
qualitatively the same as for the lithium atom [16]. The
ﬁeld strengths for the corresponding transition points are
roughly two times higher for the Be+ ion than for the Li
atom.

V. SELECTED QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS

In tables III and IV we present the total energies of the
four ground state electronic conﬁgurations of the beryl-
lium atom and the three ground state electronic conﬁg-
urations of the ion Be+, respectively. These data cover
a very broad range of the ﬁeld strengths from γ = 0 and
very weak magnetic ﬁelds starting with γ = 0.001 up to

extremely strong ﬁelds γ = 10000. The latter value of
the ﬁeld strength can be considered as a rough limit of
applicability of the non-relativistic quantum equations to
the problem (see below). The corresponding data on the
Be+ ion can be found in tables II and IV.

So far there exist three works which should be men-
tioned in the context of the problem of the beryllium
atom in strong magnetic ﬁelds. Ref. [19] deals with the
1s22s2 state of this atom in ﬁelds 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1000 and

6

ref. [24] investigates the ground state energies of atoms
with nuclear charge number Z ≤ 10 in the high-ﬁeld, i.e.
fully spin polarised regime. Both these works contain
calculations carried out by the method used in the cur-
rent work and do not represent a basis for comparison.

On the other hand, the behaviour of the wavefunctions
and many intrinsic characteristics of atoms in external
magnetic ﬁelds are associated not with the total energy,
but with the binding energies of separate electrons (2)
and the total binding energy of the system

The comparison of our results with an adiabatic Hartree-
Fock calculation of atoms with Z ≤ 10 [30] is presented
in [24] and we can brieﬂy summarise this comparison for
two values of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths: for B12 = 0.1
(i.e. B = 0.1 × 1012G) our result is E = −0.89833keV
whereas ref. [30] yields E = −0.846keV; for B12 = 5 (i.e.
B = 5 × 1012G) our result is E = −3.61033keV, whereas
ref. [30] yields E = −3.5840keV. This comparison allows

us to draw the conclusion of a relatively low precision
of the adiabatic approximation for multi-electron atoms
even for relatively high magnetic ﬁelds.

In ﬁgure 3 we present the ionization energy Eion of the
beryllium atom depending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
This continuous dependence is divided into six parts cor-
responding to diﬀerent pairs of the ground state conﬁg-
urations of the Be atom and Be+ ion involved into the
ionization energy. The ﬁve vertical dotted lines in ﬁgure 3

mark the boundaries of these sections. The alteration of
the sections of growing and decreasing ionization energy
originates from diﬀerent dependencies of the total ener-
gies of the Be and Be+ on the magnetic ﬁeld strength for
diﬀerent pairs of the ground state conﬁgurations of these
two systems. One can see the sharp decrease of the ion-
ization energy between the crossovers (4) and (5). This
behaviour is due to the fact that Eion is determined in

this section by the rapidly decreasing total energy of the
state 1s2p−13d−2 of the Be+ ion (ﬁgure 2) and by the
energy of the Be atom in the state 1s22p−13d−2 which
is very weakly dependent on the ﬁeld strength (ﬁgure
1). Another remarkable feature of the curve Eion(γ) is
its behaviour in the range of ﬁeld strengths between the
transitions (2) and (3). The ionization energy in this re-
gion contains a very shallow maximum and in the whole
section it is almost independent on the magnetic ﬁeld.

Thus, the ionization energy is stationary in this regime
of ﬁeld strengths γ = 0.3 − 0.5 a.u.
typical for many
magnetic white dwarfs [8].

The above-discussed properties are based on the be-
haviour of the total energy of the Be atom and Be+ ion.

where N is the number of electrons. The binding en-
ergies of the ground state electronic conﬁgurations of
Be and Be+ depending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength
are presented in ﬁgures 4 and 5. These dependencies
at very strong magnetic ﬁelds may illustrate our consid-
erations of the previous sections. One can see in ﬁg-

ure 4 that the high-ﬁeld ground state 1s2p−13d−24f−3
is not the most tightly bound state of the beryllium
atom. For all the values of the magnetic ﬁelds consid-
ered in this paper its binding energy is lower than that
of states 1s22s2p−1 and 1s22p−13d−2 and for γ < 100 it
is lower than EB1s2 2s2 . The latter circumstance can be
easily explained by the fact that the 1s22s2 conﬁgura-
tion contains two tightly bound orbitals 1s whereas the
1s2p−13d−24f−3 possess only one such orbital. However,

with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strengths the contribution
of the group 2p−13d−24f−3 to the binding energy turns
out to be larger than that of the 1s2s2 group. Analo-
gously we can expect EB1s2p−1 3d−24f−3 > EB1s2 2s2p−1 at
some very large ﬁelds γ > 10000. On the other hand,
it is evident that the state 1s2p−13d−24f−3 must be
less bound than 1s22p−13d−2 because both these con-
ﬁgurations are constructed of orbitals with binding en-

ergies, logarithmically increasing as γ → ∞, but the
1s22p−13d−2 contains an additional 1s orbital, which is
more tightly bound than 4f−3 at arbitrary ﬁeld strengths.
The plot for the Be+ ion (ﬁgure 5) illustrates the same
features and one can see in this ﬁgure nearly parallel
curves EB1s2 2p−1 (γ) and EB1s2p−1 3d−2(γ) in the strong
ﬁeld regime.

Figures 6 and 7 allow us to add some details to the
considerations of the previous section. These ﬁgures

present spatial distributions of the total electronic densi-
ties for the ground state conﬁgurations of the beryllium
atom and its positive ion, respectively. These pictures
allow us to gain insights into the geometry of the dis-
tribution of the electronic density in space and in par-

7

ticular its dependence on the magnetic quantum num-
ber and the total spin. The ﬁrst pictures in these ﬁg-
ures present the distribution of the electronic density
for the ground state for γ = 0. The following pictures
show the distributions of the electronic densities for val-

ues of the ﬁeld strength which mark the boundaries of
the regimes of ﬁeld strengths belonging to the diﬀerent
ground state conﬁgurations. For the high-ﬁeld ground
states we present the distribution of the electronic density
at the crossover ﬁeld strength and at γ = 500. For each
conﬁguration the eﬀect of the increasing ﬁeld strength
consists in compressing the electronic distribution to-
wards the z axis. However the crossovers of ground state

conﬁgurations involve the opposite eﬀect due to the fact
that these crossovers are associated with an increase of
the total magnetic quantum number M .

In the ﬁrst rows of ﬁgures 6 and 7 one can see a dense
core of 1s2 electrons inside the bold solid line contour
and a diﬀuse distribution of 2s electrons outside this
core. The prolate shape of the bold solid line contour
in the ﬁrst plot of the ﬁgure 6 (1s22s2, γ = 0) reﬂects
the non-spherical distribution of the 2s electrons in our
calculations or the admixture of the 1s22p2
0 conﬁguration
to the 1s22s2 one from the point of view of the multi-
conﬁgurational approach [26–29].

Some additional issues concerning the results presented
above have to be discussed. First, our HF results do
not include the eﬀects of correlation. To take into ac-
count the latter would require a multi-conﬁgurational ap-
proach which goes beyond the scope of the present paper.

We, however, do not expect that the correlation energy
changes our main conclusions like, for example, the fact of
the crossovers with respect to the diﬀerent ground states
conﬁgurations. With increasing ﬁeld strength the eﬀec-
tive one particle picture should be an increasingly better
description of the wave function and the percentage of
the correlation energy should therefore decrease (see ref.
[23] for an investigation on this subject). Two other im-
portant issues are relativistic eﬀects and eﬀects due to

the ﬁnite nuclear mass. Both these points are basically
important for very high magnetic ﬁeld strengths and they
have been discussed in ref. [24]. For the systems Be and
Be+ and for most of the ﬁeld strengths considered here
these eﬀects result in minor corrections to the energy.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have applied our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method
to the magnetised neutral beryllium atom and beryllium
positive ion. The method is ﬂexible enough to yield pre-

cise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths and our calcula-
tions for the ground and several excited states are per-
formed for magnetic ﬁeld strengths ranging from zero up
to 2.3505 · 109T (γ = 10000). Our considerations focused
on the ground states and their crossovers with increasing
ﬁeld strength. The ground state of the beryllium atom
undergoes three transitions involving four diﬀerent elec-
tronic conﬁgurations. For weak ﬁelds up to γ = 0.0412

the ground state arises from the ﬁeld-free ground state
conﬁguration 1s22s2 with the total spin z-projection
Sz = 0. With increasing strength of the ﬁeld two diﬀer-
ent electronic conﬁgurations with Sz = −1 consequently
become the ground state: 1s22s2p−1 and 1s22p−13d−2.
At γ = 4.567 the last crossover of the ground state con-
ﬁgurations takes place and for γ > 4.567 the ground state
wavefunction is represented by the high-ﬁeld-limit fully
spin polarised conﬁguration 1s2p−13d−24f−3, Sz = −2.
For the ion Be+ we obtain three diﬀerent ground state
conﬁgurations possessing two values of the spin projec-
tion. For ﬁelds below γ = 0.3185 the ground state
electronic conﬁguration has the spin projection Sz =
−1/2, magnetic quantum number M = 0 and qualita-
tively coincides with the zero-ﬁeld ground state conﬁg-
uration 1s22s. Between γ = 0.3185 and γ = 4.501 the
ground state is represented by another conﬁguration with
Sz = −1/2, i.e. 1s22p−1 (M = −1). Above the point
γ = 4.501 the fully spin polarised high-ﬁeld-limit conﬁg-
uration 1s2p−13d−2 (Sz = −3/2) is the actual ground
state of the Be+ ion. Thus, the sequence of electronic
ground state conﬁgurations for the Be+ ion is similar to
the sequence for the Li atom [16]. We present detailed
tables of energies of the ground state conﬁgurations for
Be and Be+.

For Be and Be+ we have presented also the binding
energies of the ground state conﬁgurations dependent on
the magnetic ﬁeld strength and maps of electronic densi-
ties for these conﬁgurations. For the Be atom we present
its ionization energy dependent on the ﬁeld strength.

Our investigation represents the ﬁrst conclusive study

8

of the ground state of the beryllium atom and Be+ ion
for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. For the Be atom we have
obtained a new sequence of electronic conﬁgurations with
increasing ﬁeld strength. This sequence does not coincide
with any such sequences obtained previously for other

atoms and ions and could not be predicted even quali-
tatively without detailed calculations. Putting together
what we currently know about ground states of atomic
systems in strong magnetic ﬁelds we can conclude that
the H, He, Li, Be, C, He+, Li+ and Be+ ground states
have been identiﬁed. For other atoms and multiple series
of ions the question about the ground state conﬁgurations
is still open.

Abstract

Contrary to popular belief, the Zeeman eﬀect can be treated exactly in single-electron systems, for
arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld strengths, as long as the term quadratic in the magnetic ﬁeld can be ignored.
These formulas were actually derived already around 1927 by Darwin, using the classical picture of
angular momentum, and presented in their proper quantum-mechanical form in 1933 by Bethe, although
instead,
without any proof. The expressions have since been more or less lost from the literature;
the conventional treatment nowadays is to present only the approximations for weak and strong ﬁelds,
respectively. However, in fusion research and other plasma physics applications, the magnetic ﬁelds
applied to control the shape and position of the plasma span the entire region from weak to strong ﬁelds,
and there is a need for a uniﬁed treatment. In this paper we present the detailed quantum-mechanical
derivation of the exact eigenenergies and eigenstates of hydrogen-like atoms and ions in a static magnetic
ﬁeld. Notably, these formulas are not much more complicated than the better-known approximations.
Moreover, the derivation allows the value of the electron spin gyromagnetic ratio gs to be diﬀerent from
2. For completeness, we then review the details of dipole transitions between two hydrogenic levels, and
calculate the corresponding Zeeman spectrum. The various approximations made in the derivation are
also discussed in details.

Introduction

At the end of the 19th century, when Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism had been established, it was
known that electromagnetic radiation is produced by oscillating electric charges. The charges that produce
light were however still a mystery. At the same time, it was generally believed that an electric current was
made up of charged particles. Lorentz suggested that atoms might also consist of charged particles, and
that the oscillations of these particles inside the atoms might be the source of light. If this were true, then
a magnetic ﬁeld ought to have an eﬀect on the oscillations and therefore on the wavelength of the light thus
produced. In 1896 Zeeman, a pupil of Lorentz, demonstrated this phenomenon [1], known as the Zeeman
eﬀect, and in 1902 they were awarded the Nobel Prize.

Lorentz was thus one of the ﬁrst to predict the existence of the electron, which, within a year later,
was discovered by Thomson, at least as a free particle. This, in combination with the results obtained by
Planck and Einstein regarding the nature of black-body radiation and the photo-electric eﬀect, led to the
subsequent emergence of Bohr’s atomic theory.

A full understanding of the Zeeman eﬀect can only be obtained from quantum mechanics, but Lorentz
was nevertheless soon after the initial discovery by Zeeman able to produce a simple classical theory which
predicted certain aspects of the polarization of the diﬀerent spectral components. These were later veriﬁed
experimentally by Zeeman. Soon after the discovery of the so-called anomalous Zeeman eﬀect (the weak-
ﬁeld limit), around 1905, came the development of the Land´e vector model of the atom. Using this model,
with its semi-empirical rules, basically all aspects of the observed Zeeman spectra could be explained and
predicted [2]. This was however most fortuitous, since the classical Land´e g-factor happens to be identical
to its quantum-mechanical counterpart.

Based on the Land´e vector model of angular momentum, in combination with the wave-mechanics of
Schr¨odinger, Darwin [3] was in 1927 able to solve ”the problem of a spinning electriﬁed body moving in a
central orbit in a magnetic ﬁeld [. . . ] by the method of the wave mechanics in spherical harmonics”. The
formalism presented there bears very little resemblance to how the problem is formulated nowadays, but the
treatment is actually equivalent to an exact solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for the Zeeman eﬀect.

It is certainly amusing to read Darwin’s statement that ”The proper attack on this problem would
undoubtedly be by way of the recent work of Heisenberg [. . . ] but this theory is still in the making, so it has
not been practicable to apply it here”; the article goes on to say that the work of Heisenberg ”could give
all the results of this paper; but it would have been harder to follow because the matrix methods are not so
easy for most readers as are spherical harmonics.”

Today the situation is rather the opposite, and we shall therefore in this paper present the exact eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors for the Zeeman eﬀect in single-electron ions (i.e. hydrogenic systems), using the matrix
formulation of quantum mechanics. These expressions are not new; they appeared as early as 1933, due
to Bethe [4], and they have also been published in the well-known book by Bethe and Salpeter [5], where
several aspects of the fundamental properties of the Zeeman eﬀect, as well as certain approximations made
in the treatment, are discussed in depth.

However, in neither of the above quoted works is given any indication – or reference – of how to derive
these exact formulas. Due to this, perhaps, the presentation of the Zeeman eﬀect found in modern text-books
on atomic physics (see e.g. Ref. 6, Section 5.2), is limited to the discussion of the weak and strong ﬁeld limits,
known respectively as the anomalous and normal Zeeman eﬀect, and perhaps some particular intermediate
cases, where the Zeeman eﬀect is also known as the Paschen–Back eﬀect. (By strong and weak ﬁelds, we
mean that the energy contribution from the magnetic ﬁeld is large or small compared to the spin–orbit
interaction.)

For many-electron atoms, this is naturally the proper attack on the problem, since an exact solution is
unattainable. However, for the particular case of hydrogenic atoms and ions, the exact treatment is not
much more complicated; in fact, the resulting expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are quite
simple. The spectral properties of single-electron ions have recently received rekindled interest due to a
variety of applications within plasma spectroscopy (for a review, see Ref. 7 and references therein). In e.g.
fusion research, strong magnetic ﬁelds are used to control the shape and position of the plasma. A detailed
understanding of the inﬂuence of these ﬁelds on the spectral lines is crucial for a correct interpretation of
the observed line-widths, which are employed for temperature measurements [8, 9], among other things.
Moreover, the magnetic ﬁeld strengths employed often span the entire scale from weak to strong ﬁelds, and
there is therefore a clear need for a uniﬁed treatment of the Zeeman eﬀect, valid for all ﬁelds.

The structure of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we will show how to solve the Schr¨odinger equation
exactly for a hydrogenic system in a magnetic ﬁeld, under the assumption that the quadratic term in the

2

magnetic ﬁeld strength can be ignored. We then show in Section 3 how expansions of the exact expressions
reproduce the traditional results of weak and strong ﬁelds. As a bonus, a quantitative expression is found for
determining the validity of these approximations. States with zero angular momentum must be considered
separately, and actually correspond to an extreme case of the strong-ﬁeld approximation, as discussed in
Section 4. Section 5 contains a review of the dipole transition matrix elements and selection rules, and ﬁnally
we discuss in Section 6 the approximations made during the derivations.

2 Exact solution of the Schr¨odinger equation

As pointed out above, the traditional treatment of the Zeeman eﬀect in most text-books is limited to the cases
where the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld can be separated from the eﬀects of the spin–orbit interaction. In the
weak-ﬁeld limit, the magnetic interaction is introduced as a perturbation to the spin–orbit eigenstates, and
vice-versa in the strong-ﬁeld case. In this picture, all perturbations are already diagonal and the formalism
is trivial.

In the general case, to be presented here, these two eﬀects must however be treated simultaneously. Our
method will be to diagonalize the combined perturbation in a basis set consisting of the solutions of the
ﬁeld-free, non-relativistic Schr¨odinger equation for a single-electron ion. Depending on the orbital quantum
number ℓ of the states considered, the matrices will be of various dimensions. A signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation
will however emerge from the algebra, and the ﬁnal energy matrix will separate into a number of 2
2
sub-matrices which are easily diagonalized. The case ℓ = 1 is treated in some detail in Ref. 10, from where
the idea for the method has been adopted and further developed.

where µ = meM/(me + M ) is the reduced electron mass (me and M are the electron and nuclear masses,
respectively) and Z the nuclear charge. Because of the spherical symmetry, the wavefunction ψ can be
written as a product

of an angular part, given by the spherical harmonics Yℓm(θ, ϕ), and a radial part Rnℓ(r).

The energy of each eigenstate nℓmℓi

to the energy, breaking the degeneracy in the ℓ quantum number. The degeneracy in the m quantum number
is only broken through an external ﬁeld such as the magnetic ﬁeld about to be studied.

It is not entirely obvious which value of the electron mass to use in Eq. (4), but since the perturbation
in itself is a small correction, it will make an insigniﬁcant diﬀerence whether we use the electron mass me
or the reduced mass µ [6, footnote on p. 196]. Therefore, we shall in what follows always use the standard
electron mass in perturbation theory.

Comparing the magnitudes of the linear and quadratic terms, one ﬁnds [6] that their ratio is of the order
10−6/Tesla for atomic systems. Except for extreme cases, such as neutron stars, the quadratic term is
B
hence completely negligible, which simpliﬁes the mathematics a great deal. (When included, the quadratic
term will lead to diamagnetism [5].) For very strong magnetic ﬁelds, when the spin–orbit interaction can be
neglected altogether but the quadratic term not, the energy levels can be found by diﬀerent methods [11].

So far we have used a semi-classical picture of the electron by ignoring the spin, which however contributes
an additional, intrinsic, angular momentum. To the magnetic moment of the electron from the classical
angular momentum

According to the original Dirac theory, the magnetic moment of the electron due to its intrinsic spin is
2. However, using quantum electrodynamics (QED), one ﬁnds that the value of the spin
determined by gs ≡

This correction is called the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Since it poses no problems to
retain a general value of gs in our calculations, we will do so. Moreover, this allows the formalism to be
extended (with proper modiﬁcations, accounting for the relative dielectric constant and the electron eﬀective
mass) to e.g. solids, where the values of the gyromagnetic ratio may diﬀer signiﬁcantly from 2, and even be
negative [12].

The energy of a magnetic dipole – which the electron eﬀectively becomes due to its magnetic moment –

in a magnetic ﬁeld is

2.3 Perturbed energies and eigenstates

To diagonalize the perturbation

H ′ = H ′

so + H ′

we ﬁrst need to introduce a proper set of basis states. This is actually not trivial [5, Section 45β], but to
simplify matters we shall use the Pauli approximation, in which each state is a two-component spinor and
the spin operators are described by the Pauli spin matrices.

We can therefore use as basis the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0, arranged in a proper
spinor notation. In the unperturbed system, the good quantum numbers are, in addition to n and ℓ, also
mℓ and ms, although the eigenstates are degenerate in the m:s. In the presence of the external ﬁeld, the
individual m:s are no longer good quantum numbers, but only their sum m = mℓ + ms.

We can therefore anticipate that each new eigenstates will be a linear combination of exactly two un-
1
perturbed eigenstates, corresponding to ms =
2 and mℓ chosen accordingly. But since the spin–orbit
interaction is not diagonal in the unperturbed eigenstates, we need to carry out the derivation using the full
expansion in the unperturbed eigenstates

For the unknown element in the third row, second column, the only diﬀerence is that the involved states
are coupled by L− instead. The prime is only a book-keeping label; mℓ and m′
ℓ are interchangeable as long
as L+ is replaced by L− and vice versa, and hence this second unknown element is exactly the same as the
ﬁrst one, with the only change of removing the primes.

3 Strong and weak ﬁeld expansions

The formalism as presented above makes no assumptions of the relative strength between the spin–orbit
interaction and the magnetic ﬁeld. In the traditional derivation, however, the one of the two which is stronger
is ﬁrst treated as a perturbation to the central-ﬁeld Hamiltonian, which gives a set of new eigenfunctions.
Subsequently, the other eﬀect is treated as a perturbation to this new system, using its eigenfunctions as a
basis set.

In many practical cases the magnetic ﬁelds in question are either ”weak” – laboratory ﬁeld strengths are
typically of the order 10–100 mT – or ”strong” (superconducting electromagnets or astrophysical objects),
making the traditional approach seemingly more appealing, since the algebra and the resulting expressions
are somewhat simpler (but only very little!).

It is therefore desirable to attempt to derive these limits from the general case, and also to obtain
a quantitative criterion for when these approximations are valid, which is generally brushed over in the
traditional texts, where ”strong” or ”weak” ﬁelds are merely assumed. For the weak-ﬁeld case, it is necessary
to assume gs = 2, and therefore we will also assume this for strong ﬁelds, in order to facilitate the comparison
with expressions in the literature.

As our starting point we will use the expression for ∆E±

m, Eq. (31). The parameter determining the
relative strength of the magnetic interaction to the spin–orbit interaction is β. Assuming that this quantity
(2ℓ + 1), we can neglect both (2ℓ + 1)2 and the term linear in β in the square-root, and
is large, i.e. β

also the term (

The solutions to the corner elements given by Eq. (30) also reduce to this expression if we ignore ℓ compared
to (ℓ + 1)β. This result is trivially obtained from Eq. (15) if the spin–orbit term L
S is ignored, and thus
corresponds to the well-known expression for the normal Zeeman eﬀect.

·

In this strong-ﬁeld limit, the states are split in m but degenerate in ℓ (except of course for the dependence
on ℓ in the relativistic correction, Eq. (4)), as seen in Fig. 2. The eigenstates are particularly simple, since the

if we neglect the term quadratic in B. The solutions to the corner elements are also incorporated in this
formula (the top expression), which is easily shown – without approximations – from Eq. (30), if we realize
that m/(ℓ + 1/2) =

1.

We can identify the ﬁrst term in Eq. (35) as the contribution from the spin–orbit interaction if the
magnetic ﬁeld is ignored. The two cases correspond to j = ℓ
1/2, where j is the quantum number
associated with the total angular momentum J = L + S which is conserved in the absence of a magnetic
ﬁeld. The energy contribution from the magnetic ﬁeld can now be evaluated, within this approximation,
through the expression [6]

is the Land´e factor. Thus ∆Emagn = gµBBmj, which can be shown to give exactly the remaining part of
Eq. (35). We now also realize why the corner solutions ended up in the top expression of Eq. (35), since
m
|

= ℓ + 1/2 only is allowed for the triplet state j = ℓ + 1/2.
In the weak-ﬁeld case the distance between two levels corresponding to subsequent values of m within
the same multiplet will be the same for all levels (cf. Fig. 1). This case is, for historical reasons, called
anomalous Zeeman eﬀect, but is actually the more commonly encountered one. Since the splitting of the
levels for diﬀerent multiplets is diﬀerent (i.e. dependent on j), there will be more lines in the spectrum than
for the normal Zeeman eﬀect.

The approximate expressions for strong and weak ﬁelds can thus be derived as expansions of the exact
result, Eq. (31). We may now also specify quantitatively under what conditions these approximations hold,
since this is determined by whether β = B/B0 = BµB/W is much greater or much smaller than 2ℓ + 1.
Inserting the constants into Eq. (17) gives

For light atoms and states with n and ℓ less than 4, this expression takes values between 0.1 and 10 Tesla;
for heavier atoms the fourth power of Z will dominate and, except for high shells and strong ﬁelds, the
weak-ﬁeld approximation will almost always be valid.

9

As an example, let us consider the states n = 3 and 4 in HeII (Z = 2). Inserting ℓ = 1 and 2 for n = 3
(for ℓ = 0 the strong-ﬁeld approximation is exact; see the following section) the threshold ﬁeld strengths
come out as 3.70 and 1.23 Tesla respectively. For n=4 the corresponding values for ℓ=1, 2 and 3 become
1.56, 0.52 and 0.26 Tesla. As brieﬂy mentioned in the Introduction, a modern application of Zeeman eﬀect
is to use fusion plasma spectroscopy in order to determine the plasma temperature, by e.g. studying the
transition between precisely these states in HeII [13]. Typical magnetic ﬁelds in a tokamak the size of JET’s
lie in the range 1–3 Tesla, and we thus clearly see that such an investigation cannot be carried out using
either of the traditional approximations.

4 Treatment of s-states

As mentioned above, the expectation value W is only deﬁned for ℓ
= 0 (cf. Eq. (19)). But, in light of the
previous section, we now realize that ℓ = 0 corresponds to an extreme case of Eq. (34), where the magnetic
ﬁeld is inﬁnitely much stronger than the spin–orbit interaction. Hence, without approximation, the energy
eigenvalues are (here we may keep a general value of gs)

5 Transitions and matrix elements

To calculate the Zeeman pattern of the spectral line from a transition between two diﬀerent nℓ states, we need
to consider the selection rules and the transition matrix elements. Since the eigenstates (32ab) of the total
Hamiltonian, Eq. (12), are simply linear combinations of hydrogenic states nℓmℓmsi
, it is however enough
to employ the well-known results for transitions between two hydrogenic states (derived in the absence of
any magnetic ﬁeld).

The derivation of the matrix elements for spontaneous emission is a procedure found in any textbook on
the theory of atomic spectra (see e.g. Ref. 6, Chapter 4). We therefore merely state the results in order that
this paper can be used as a self-contained reference on how to calculate the Zeeman spectrum. We will then
give an illustrative example of the resulting spectrum when these expressions are applied to the Zeeman
problem at hand.

5.1 Spontaneous emission matrix elements

state a is found from Fermi’s Golden Rule to be

5.3 Polarization

We now return to Eqs. (41) and (45) to study the polarization of the emitted radiation. Any arbitrary
polarization can be expressed as a linear combination of two independent directions ˆe1 and ˆe2, such as left
and right circularly polarized, or two perpendicular linear polarizations. For this discussion we choose the
latter. We also introduce a wavevector ˆk of unit length (as are the e-vectors) pointing in the direction of
propagation of the emitted light, so that the three vectors ˆe1, ˆe2 and ˆk form a right-handed system (see
Fig. 3). As before we let the z-axis be the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. Taking, arbitrarily, ˆe2 to lie in
the xy-plane and ˆe1 pointing downwards, we have

Next we use the properties of the 3j-symbol in Eq. (48), which is non-zero if and only if m′

ℓ = mℓ + q,
as already stated. Since each of the three values of q=0 or
1 only may be satisﬁed one at a time, we have
three separate cases to study. These are for historical reasons referred to as π and σ± (from the German
words for parallel and perpendicular, ”senkrecht”).

±

π In this case ∆mℓ = 0, and consequently we only need to consider

0 (we suppress the quantum numbers

in this part). This gives the transition rate

for a photon with polarization ˆe1, whereas the rate is zero for polarization ˆe2. Since the ˆk-vector
is deﬁned as the direction in which the radiation is observed, we ﬁnd that if the emission is viewed
longitudinally (ˆk parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld), θ = 0 and so the π component is absent.
In the
in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, we have ˆe1 =
transverse direction (θ = π/2), i.e.
1) and thus the π component will be plane polarized with ˆǫ = ˆe1 in the direction of the negative
(0, 0,
−
z-axis.

σ+ This case corresponds to ∆mℓ = m′

−1, and
since the two polarization directions are orthogonal and independent, we may sum the probabilities
instead of the amplitudes. In result, we obtain

The σ+ component is plane polarized with ˆǫ = ˆe2 in transverse observation, whereas in longitudinal
observation it is circularly (left-hand) polarized. The intensity of each σ component is always half of
the π component in transverse observation.

The σ− component is also plane polarized in transverse observation, and (right-hand) circularly polar-

From here on it is a simple matter to calculate the intensities of all transitions in the Zeeman pattern;
see Fig. 4 for an example. The number of components increases rapidly with the quantum numbers; for a
7

8 transition the total number is 512, although many will be very weak.

6 Discussion of approximations

In this section we summarize the approximations made in the treatment. They are not many, as we have
strived to keep things as general and exact as possible. For an even more detailed discussion, see Ref. 5,
Sections 47α–ǫ.

12

•

The quadratic term
In Section 2.2 we ignored the term in the Hamiltonian quadratic in A, and we also showed that for ﬁelds
of normal strengths (less than 1000 Tesla or so), this approximation is certainly valid, and simpliﬁes
the algebra considerably.

A particular eﬀect which enters if the quadratic term is retained is the possibility of mixing states with
diﬀerent ℓ quantum numbers. The linear term in A commutes with L2, making ℓ a good quantum
number, but the quadratic term does not. Speciﬁcally, it introduces mixing between states with ℓ-
values diﬀering by
2. Again, this will only be of importance for very strong magnetic ﬁelds and can
often safely be ignored.

±

•

•

Relativistic corrections
Using the Pauli approximation instead of the Dirac theory means we are only calculating the Zeeman
eﬀect to lowest order in α2. Assuming that all perturbations (magnetic ﬁeld and spin–orbit interaction)
are small, we remedy this by using the same correction Eq. (4) as for the ﬁeld-free case to correct for
the non-relativistic momentum operator. Eﬀects beyond this should be negligible.

The anomalous magnetic moment
In the approximate treatment of the anomalous Zeeman eﬀect (weak ﬁelds) it is necessary to use the
value gs = 2. As it turned out, we were not restricted by this approximation in our exact derivations
1 and gs/2 appearing in the ﬁnal expressions, Eqs. (30) and (31)), although the
(note the factors gs −
inﬂuence is very small – unless of course gs diﬀers signiﬁcantly from 2.

Nuclear motion and hyperﬁne structure
We have already taken into account the nuclear motion by using the reduced mass µ of the electron
for the central-ﬁeld Hamiltonian.
In the perturbations, we have kept the electron mass since the
perturbations themselves are small, so any corrections to them are even smaller [6].

Hyperﬁne structure due to the nuclear magnetic moment is in general orders of magnitude smaller than
the ﬁne-structure splitting (spin–orbit interaction). Therefore, we expect that hyperﬁne structure will
not perturb the Zeeman spectrum except for extremely weak magnetic ﬁelds, where the Zeeman pattern
can be heavily inﬂuenced.

7 Summary

In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated how the problem of a single-electron atom or ion in a static
magnetic ﬁeld can be solved exactly, under the only simplifying approximation that the term which is
quadratic in the ﬁeld strength can be neglected in the Hamiltonian. No assumption was made regarding the
value of the electron spin gyromagnetic ratio, which allows the obtained results to be readily generalized to
applications in e.g. solids.

By using the results presented here, a uniﬁed treatment of the Zeeman eﬀect becomes possible over the
entire range of ﬁelds presently employed in e.g. fusion plasma, where the inﬂuence of the Zeeman eﬀect on the
plasma temperature measurements has been demonstrated to be signiﬁcant in many cases. The well-known
formulas for the weak and strong ﬁeld limits are easily obtained as expansions of the general results, and in
addition it was possible to obtain a quantitative expression for the ﬁelds at which these approximations are
valid.

The obtained general expressions for the eigenstates and their corresponding energies are not very com-
plicated. As a ﬁnal remark, one may therefore point out that the derivation, as presented here, has certain
pedagogical merits and provides a good example of how to apply the power of matrix algebra to quantum-
mechanical problems.

Figure 1: The total energy shift due to both spin–orbit interaction and an applied magnetic ﬁeld for the
n = 2 shell in HeII. The energy zero-point is chosen at 2s 2S1/2 at B = 0. The states are marked by their
corresponding to the notation in Eqs. (31) and (32ab), except for
quantum number m with a following
the states with
= ℓ + 1/2 for which there only are two unique solutions, Eq. (30). For small magnetic

ﬁelds, the states are split linearly according to Eq. (35). Note that without any magnetic ﬁeld, the two levels
2s 2S1/2 and 2p 2P1/2 are degenerate (the small diﬀerence due to the Lamb shift is ignored). Also see Fig. 2,
where the ﬁeld scale is extended.

Figure 2: In this ﬁgure, the same system as in Fig. 1 is shown, but for stronger ﬁelds. As the magnetic ﬁeld
approaches high values, the pattern converges into ﬁve states, according to Eq. (34). Since m takes on the

ﬁgure. Noteworthy is also the anti-crossing rule: even if some lines cross as B increases, no lines with the
same m-values ever cross. This is an eﬀect of level repulsion between states of equal quantum mechanical
symmetry (cf. Ref. 14, pp. 292–295 and Fig. 10-2 therein.)

Figure 4: The complete Zeeman pattern for the HeII line at 4687 ˚A (vacuum) consists of 146 components. It
is here calculated for B = 2 Tesla at a viewing angle θ = 40◦ relative to the magnetic ﬁeld axis (cf. Fig. 3).
Only components with intensity greater than one (in the plot units) are included; the π components are
conventionally drawn with negative intensity.

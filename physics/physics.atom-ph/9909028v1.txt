Abstract

When the Hamiltonian H of a system is represented by a ﬁnite matrix H, constructed

from a discrete basis with overlap matrix B, the matrix representation G(E)
H) covers only one branch of G(E). We show how all
of the resolvent G(E) = 1/(E
t0eiφ. This permits
branches can be speciﬁed by the phase φ of a complex unit of time tφ ≡
H to be constructed on a real basis; the only duty of the basis is to span the dynamical region
of space, without regard for the particular asymptotic boundary conditions that pertain to
the problem of interest. Speciﬁcally, we show that G(E) has the series representation

1 Introduction

The theoretical treatment of a continuous stationary or quasistationary process requires
some knowledge of the resolvent G(E)
H), where H is the Hamiltonian of the
1/(E
system at hand. There are numerous methods for determining G(E), at least approximately.
Frequently H is approximated by a ﬁnite-dimensional matrix H, in which case G(E) becomes

the matrix G(E) = 1/(EB
H) where B is the overlap matrix for the discrete basis functions
used in constructing H. In principle, these basis functions are only required to accurately
span the (generally ﬁnite) spatial region where the dynamics take place. However, in practice,
unless the wavefunction is matched to its asymptotic form outside the dynamical region, as
is done for example in the R-matrix method,[1] the basis may also be burdened by the
requirement that it incorporate the asymptotic boundary conditions. This is evident from
the absence of branch points in G(E); the expression 1/(EB
H) has only poles (since the
eigenvalue spectrum of H is discrete). Some of these poles (those in the bound-state region)
are legitimate, while the others (those in the scattering-state region) simulate the branch
cut of G(E). Hence G(E) represents only one of the branches of the exact resolvent, and
this particular branch is determined by the choice of basis. In this paper we derive a series
representation of the resolvent which is such that the asymptotic boundary conditions can be
imposed independently of the basis, without matching the wavefunction; a particular branch
of G(E) is speciﬁed by the phase of a complex unit of time. This representation may aﬀord
the possibility of employing a discrete basis more eﬃciently. In addition, it may prove to
be a useful step towards the practical realization of a general theory of continuum processes
based on ﬂux formulae, an approach (described in [2] and references therein) which does not
require detailed knowledge of the asymptotic form of the wavefunction.

We pause for a moment to mention some of the diﬃculties that arise when a discrete
basis is required to simulate the asymptotic behavior of the open channels of a system. For
the sake of discussion we consider a speciﬁc but typical basis that is used to construct the
Hamiltonian of a one-electron system such as a hydrogen atom; the basis functions are

√

2iκ(2iκr)l+1eiκrLn(2iκr)Ylm(ˆx),

−

where Ln(x) is an ordinary Laguerre polynomial of degeree n, where Ylm(ˆx) is a spherical
harmonic, and where κ is a parameter — the wavenumber of the basis. This basis can be
readily generalized to a multiparticle system by specifying the orientation of the system in
terms of Euler angles and by introducing products of radial functions, one in each of the
interparticle distances (or combinations of them), perhaps associating a diﬀerent wavenumber
with each distance. When the basis wavenumbers are positive pure imaginary the basis
functions are real, they decay exponentially, and hence are well-suited to the description of
closed channels and to the study of bound-state properties.[3] However, a real basis cannot
simulate the asymptotic behavior of scattering states since the exponential factor eiκr does
not oscillate; while the polynomials Ln(2iκr) can incorporate the oscillations of a one-particle
continuum eigenfunction in the dynamical region, they cannot reproduce its asymptotic
standing-wave behavior. Moreover, when the basis is real, G(E) has spurious poles on the
“unitarity” branch cut of G(E) along the positive real energy axis, and these poles give rise
to spurious resonances with zero width. Suppose instead that the basis wavenumbers are
chosen to lie in the upper right quadrant of the complex wavenumber-plane. 1 In this case
the basis functions behave as damped outgoing waves, and they can simulate the asymptotic
behavior of a system in either a bound or compound (metastable) state; the basis is well

to rotating the particle coordinates into the lower right quadrant of the complex position-coordinate-plane.

be used to treat autoionization — see e.g.

The series representation of G(E) derived below permits the Hamiltonian to be repre-
sented by a Hermitian matrix H that is constructed from a real basis, without concern for
the particular asymptotic boundary conditions that pertain to the problem of interest. Thus
the only duty of the basis is to span the dynamical region of space. Since the wavenumber
is positive pure imaginary, the exponential factor eiκr is purely decaying; it does not dis-
criminate between ingoing and outgoing waves, and hence pays no heed to the boundary
conditions. The duty of the exponential is to restrict the range of the basis to the dynamical
region.

In order to impose asymptotic boundary conditions that are independent of the basis we
start from the observation that all the particles in a system evolve according to a common
time, and the asymptotic behaviour of the system’s wavefunction emerges from the initial
boundary conditions, at the start of the system’s evolution, say time t = 0. To simplify
our analysis we consider a system comprised of only one particle; the generalization to more
than one particle is fairly straightforward and will be dealt with elsewhere. The temporal

We can analytically continue this representation of G(E) to a sector of the E-plane that
includes the negative real E-axis if we ﬁrst project out the bound states, i.e. if we remove the
bound-state poles of G(E). Thus we consider PcontG(E)Pcont, where Pcont is the projection
Pbd, with Pbd the bound-state projection operator. We rotate the contour

in a region including the negative real E-axis. We can represent G(E) throughout the lower

diﬀerent branches of PcontG(E)Pcont, and since both representations give the same “physical”
branch of PcontG(E)Pcont on the negative real E-axis we can deﬁne a global representation
of PcontG(E)Pcont on the ﬁrst — the “physical” — sheet of the Riemann energy surface by
using Eq. (1) for Im E
0. The point is: A particular branch
of PcontG(E)Pcont on the positive energy axis can be speciﬁed by the contour of the global
integral representation. Our goal is to perform the integration over τ in such a way that a
signature of the contour is preserved.

The energy, E, can take on any value on the ﬁrst sheet of the Riemann surface cut along
the line arg (E) =
φ. The whole Riemann surface can covered by rotating the cut, i.e. by
varying the phase φ. The unit of time, tφ, is a parameter whose value is to some extent,
but not entirely, arbitrary. In our derivation of Eq. (3), the phase of tφ is restricted to the
π/2 < φ < π/2, but the series can be analytically continued outside this range.
range
This preliminary restriction on the phase is related to a restriction on the contour of the
global integral representation: The integrals of Eqs. (1) and (2) diﬀer only by their contours.
These contours can be rotated from the positive and negative real t-axes into the upper
half of the t-plane, but they must remain distinct since the integrals represent two diﬀerent
branches of G(E). Hence if we choose one contour to lie along the ray arg (t) = φ in the
upper-right quadrant, with φ therefore restricted to 0
φ < π/2, we should choose the other
contour to lie along the ray arg (t) = π + φ in the upper-left quadrant, with φ restricted
to
0; therein lies our preliminary restriction on the phase. The magnitude,
t0, of tφ should not diﬀer greatly from the characteristic unit of time for the motion of the
system, i.e. from the time it takes for the wavefunction of the system to change appreciably,
for otherwise convergence of the series would be diﬃcult to attain. In particular, t0 should
not exceed the characteristic duration of the process under study, since a measurable process
cannot take place in a time less than it takes for the wavefunction to evolve appreciably. For
the sake of discussion it is convenient to choose E to have a physically realizeable value, one
appropriate to a collision process, and so until further notice it is to be understood that E
lies on the positive real axis. Typically, the characteristic duration of a collision process is
of order 1/E so that we require Et0 < 1, or perhaps more stringently,

and only the ﬁrst term on the right side of Eq. (3) contributes, giving G(E)

all branches. Apart from this 1/E term, the dependence of G(E) on E is contained in
In(Etφ), and a particular branch of G(E) is ﬁxed by these coeﬃcients after
the coeﬃcients
specifying the phase φ. The physical branch of G(E), which has outgoing-wave behavior, is
speciﬁed by choosing φ to be in the range 0 < φ < π, and the other, “unphysical”, branch,

which has ingoing-wave behavior, is speciﬁed by choosing φ to be in the range 0 > φ >
In principle, the right side of Eq. (3) should not vary as tφ varies over its allowed range,
but in practice, when the series is truncated and the summation not fully converged, it does
vary — the less so, the better the convergence. The series is practically useful, and has
the following features: The Laguerre polynomials satisfy a 3-term recurrence relation, and
therefore they can be calculated recursively with only a minimal number of multiplications
of H.

However, a restriction concerning the inclusion of the bound states must be imposed
on the series representation to guarantee its convergence. Perhaps this is not surprising
since we were obliged to project out the bound states before writing down a global integral

This series is an asymptotic series in powers of H/E. It is applicable for large E, i.e.
it is
applicable on a short time-scale, but not in all sectors of the complex E-plane. In fact, it is
not applicable when E is real and positive; for if H is also positive, i.e. if H acts on those
of its eigenvectors belonging to the continuous eigenvalue spectrum — whose threshold we
choose to be zero — all of the terms (H/E)n are positive and the sum steadily diverges as

more terms are included. Considering this, we are motivated to delete continuous eigenvalues
much larger than E by multiplying the right side of Eq. (7) by a cutoﬀ factor (we continue
tφH , provided
to ﬁx E to be real and positive). A natural choice for the cutoﬀ factor is e−
tφH to cut oﬀ the sum we require
we impose the following restrictions on tφ: In order for e−
that Re tφ > 0, i.e.
< π/2, but since we do not need (or want) to delete continuous
eigenvalues much smaller than E we require that Et0 < 1; these are the same restrictions
on tφ mentioned after Eq. (4). (We note again that the restriction on φ can be lifted by
analytic continuation.) We can regather the terms in the sum on the right side of Eq. (7),
now modiﬁed by the cutoﬀ factor, to yield an expansion in the basis functions e−

where x = 2tφH and where the L(ν)

Here x is understood to be a continuous variable, and consequently we must restrict the
operator H to act only on those of its eigenvectors belonging to the continuous eigenvalue
spectrum. In other words, we must exclude eigenvectors belonging to the discrete eigenvalue
spectrum. Furthermore, since the sum on the right side of Eq. (7) is linear in H for H
0,
we should choose the upper index ν of the Laguerre polynomials to be 1 in order to satisfy
the end-point boundary condition at x = 0. It follows that

we arrive at Eq. (3) (with the bound-state projection operator now included). While not
obvious, the coeﬃcients deﬁned by Eq. (10) are the same as those deﬁned by Eq. (4); we
postpone proving this until section IV.

We assumed E to be real and positive in this heuristic derivation, but we can analytically
continue the result oﬀ the positive real E-axis, into the complex energy plane. If we were
to study the bound-state properties of the system we would move E close to, or onto, the
negative real axis. Of course, we would also need to include the bound states; as implied
earlier, we can do this, no matter what the value of E, by choosing φ =
π after analytic
continuation of the series representation to a region of the tφ-plane close to the negative real
axis.

±

Our primary interest is not in bound-state properties but in stationary processes in the
continuum, with E real and positive. We focus in the present work on the theory underlying
the series representation of the resolvent, rather than on practical applications. We plan to
report on applications in the future. Nevertheless, in Appendix B, we brieﬂy describe some
algorithms which are useful for the practical implementation of the series. As noted already,
for simplicity we consider a system comprised of only one particle. Our analysis is largely
informal; a mathematically rigorous treatment is beyond our abilities.

relation amplitude in the complex-time-plane. We ﬁnd that the singularities of C(t) lie in
the upper half of the t-plane. While we can expand U(t), and thereby C(t), in powers of t,
the power series for C(t) has only a small (maybe inﬁnitesimal) radius of convergence. In
section 3 we consider transforming variables, from t to a variable u, to obtain a power series
which is more useful. Thus we make a conformal transformation which maps a singularity-
free region of the t-plane — namely, the half of the complex t-plane that lies below the line
Im t/Re t = tan φ — into the unit circle in the u-plane. We can express U(t) and C(t)
as power series in u, with coeﬃcients that are rather simply related to the coeﬃcients of
the power series in t. In section 4 we perform the integration over t and obtain Eq. (3).
In Appendix A we use the series representation of the resolvent to reproduce some known
formal results, for example, threshold laws, and in Appendix B we describe some algorithms
that are useful for the numerical implementation of the series.

and is not merely a superposition of discrete (bound- and compound-) eigenstates. If the
potential has an attractive long-range Coulomb tail, a localized wavepacket has, in general,
a nonzero overlap with an inﬁnite number of bound-eigenstates of H. Indeed, if L is the
in position space, Rydberg bound states with energy
characteristic linear dimension of
µ/L are indistinguishable in the composition of
eigenvalues greater than or of the order of
the wavepacket from scattering eigenstates with energy eigenvalues less than or of the order
of µ/L. As a consequence, high Rydberg bound states, through their contribution to the
correlation function, play an important role in continuum processes, a feature we observe
below. The case where the potential has a Coulomb tail is usually an exception requiring
ψ(t)
special treatment. Leaving aside this case for the moment, the continuum portion of
i
spreads linearly in time, and therefore occupies a volume (in 3-dimensional position space)
that is proportional to t3. Since U(t) is unitary,
is conserved in time, and so
3/2. Conse-
the continuum portion of the wavepacket attenuates at each point in space as t−
quently, the correlation amplitude C(t)
contains a component which vanishes as
t−
. Therefore C(t) has a branch point at inﬁnity, and since this branch point
is of order two there must be another branch point, joined to the branch point at inﬁnity by
a cut in the complex t-plane.

t = 2it0 and t =

spread after time t is κ0t/µ, and this spread exceeds the original width of the wavepacket
when t is comaparable to t0. In other words, the singularity at 2it0 is a signature of the
time at which the wavepacket becomes signiﬁcantly deformed by spreading. The wavepacket
can evolve either forwards or backwards in time to the single point t =

depends on the arrow of time. Hence the wavepacket is double-valued at t =

that is encompassed by the branch point at t =

A general (nonGaussian) wavepacket has a momentum distribution whose very-high-
momentum components are appreciable, and the spatial tail of the wavepacket deforms
the moment it begins to evolve freely. Even the tail of a Gaussian wavepacket deforms
instantly if it evolves under the inﬂuence of a potential that can transfer a large momentum
to the particle. Hence, in general t0 = 0, i.e.
the correlation amplitude has a branch
point singularity at the origin. To be more concrete, suppose that H has bound-state and

there were no singularities in the lower-right quadrant of the k-plane, we could rotate the
contour of k-integration so that it runs along the right edge of the negative imaginary axis,
and we could subsequently move t from the positive real axis through the upper-half t-plane
to the upper edge of the negative real axis. In this case C(t) would be deﬁned everwhere in
the ﬁnite complex t-plane, except possibly for a branch point at the origin, which we cannot
exclude unless we can move t continuously along a closed loop around the origin (without
discontinuously moving the contour of k-integration). Hereafter we formally deﬁne t0 such
that the singularity of C(t) nearest to the origin is located at 2it0, and we draw a cut along
the positive imaginary axis from 2it0 to

it could not serve as a unit of time; however, this is not of concern in practice, for in practice
t0 may be small but it does not vanish, a matter we return to at the end of this section.

To conclude: In general, C(t) is a nonsingular function of t in the right-half of the ﬁnite
complex t-plane, but has a branch point on the positive imaginary axis at t = 2it0. We can

The radius of convergence of this expansion of C(t) in powers of τ is 2 since the singularity of
C(t) that is nearest to the origin is, by deﬁnition, located at 2it0. Note that we just assumed

t0 6
true that t0 = 0, in practice t0 6
= 0, as we now explain. The time that it takes the wavepacket
to deform signiﬁcantly from its initial form is governed by the highest speed in the velocity
distribution of the wavepacket as it evolves in the presence of the potential. Now the highest
speed in the velocity distribution is eﬀectively determined by the largest eigenvalue, Emax
say, of the smallest matrix H that can accurately represent H in the expression e−

Hence, in practice the characteristic value of t0 is 1/Emax, which may be very small but is

3 Conformal Transformation

To calculate the rate for some continuous stationary or quasistationary process from a
correlation amplitude we need to know the correlation amplitude for all t on either the
positive or negative real axis. However, the power series in τ is useful only for 0
< 2t0.
Since C(t) is singular on the positive imaginary axis, it is expedient to divide the t-plane into
two half-planes separated by a line through the origin, and to conformally map the lower of
these half-planes (i.e. the one free of singularities) into the unit circle; see Fig. 2. Thus we

The omission of these bound states does not aﬀect the rate for a continuum process (if the
potential is short-range), but it may aﬀect the energy shift of the system. Of course, by
π we can retain the bound states. Note that while the compound states

To obtain the large-n behavior of ccont,n(tφ), we change variables from k to k/√n on

simplicity let us assume that the angular momentum quantum number l is zero. We can

We pause for a few remarks. First, while the integral on the left side of Eq. (75) is formally
deﬁned only for tφ real and positive, both sides of Eq. (74) are analytic everywhere in the
ﬁnite tφ-plane cut along the negative real axis. Second, if l
= 0 we must modify Eq. (74) by
including a factor proportional to 1/n2l. Finally, note that the large-n behavior of ccont,n(tφ)
is determined by small k, i.e. by the continuum eigenvalues of H close to threshold. Since
the large-t behavior of Ccont(t) is also determined by the continuum eigenvalues close to
threshold, we infer that the large-t behavior of Ccont(t) is determined by those terms with
large n in the power series on the right side of Eq. (48).

It follows that if the potential is short-range, ccont,n(tφ) decreases as n−

creases. We now consider the case where the potential has an attractive Coulomb tail.
We must ﬁrst reconsider cbd,n(tφ). There are an inﬁnite number of Rydberg bound states

We would like to analytically continue cbd,n(tφ) along a path in the upper-half tφ-plane,
from the upper edge of the cut to the positive real axis on the ﬁrst sheet of the Riemann
tφ-surface. To this end we seek to replace the sum over m on the right side of Eq. (76)
by an integral over m. However, the direct replacement of sum by integral is not entirely
justiﬁed since the summand varies rapidly when n
, and the m-th and (m + 1)-th terms
of the sum may diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Nevertheless, we can accomplish the passage from sum
to integral by making a small modiﬁcation to the integrand. We ﬁrst break the cosine in the

Since C(t) is bounded throughout the sector 0
of integration into this sector and extend the integral representation to a sector in the

E-plane that includes the negative real E-axis we ﬁrst recall that both Cres(t) and Cbg(t)
are bounded throughout the lower right quadrant of the τ -plane, but Cbd(t) is unbounded in
this quadrant. Therefore, provided that we project out the bound states, and choose E to lie
temporarily on the left edge of the positive imaginary E-axis, we can rotate the integration
contour into the lower-right quadrant of the τ -plane so that it runs along the right edge of the
negative imaginary τ -axis. Subsequently, we can move E from the upper- to the lower-left
quadrant of the E-plane. Although we subtracted the bound-state contribution to R(E),
this contribution is analytic, having only poles on the negative real E-axis. Hence, we have
analytically continued R(E) from the upper- to the lower-left quadrant of the E-plane.

Since ¯C(t) is bounded throughout the sector π
arg (τ ) < π we can rotate the contour
of integration into this sector, and again extend the validity of the integral representation,
now to a sector in the upper-right quadrant of the E-plane. To analytically continue ¯R(E)
into the upper-left quadrant of the E-plane we proceed as for R(E); we project out the bound
states, choose E to lie temporarily on the left edge of the negative imaginary E-axis, rotate
the integration contour through the lower left quadrant of the τ -plane, so that it runs along
the left edge of the negative imaginary τ -axis, and subsequently move E into the upper-left
quadrant.

Since C(t) and ¯C(t) are continuous in the lower-half t-plane, the integral representations
of R(E) and ¯R(E) are identical when both contours are chosen to be the negative imaginary
τ -axis. Hence R(E) and ¯R(E) are identical in the lower-left quadrant of the E-plane; it
follows that ¯R(E) is the analytic continuation of R(E) from the upper part of the E-plane
to the lower part, on the ﬁrst sheet of the Riemann energy surface cut from 0 to
along
a line parallel to the integration contour of either R(E) or ¯R(E). At the cut, R(E) and
¯R(E) are diﬀerent branches of the same function. As noted above, the integration contours
of R(E) and ¯R(E), respectively, can be rotated into sectors of the lower- and upper-right
quadrants of the E-plane; hence the cut can be rotated into these sectors, thereby extending
the region of the Riemann energy surface covered by the integral representations. However,
these integral representations do not permit the entire Riemann surface to be covered. As we
see below, the entire surface can be covered by the series representation. The wider region
of analyticity aﬀorded by the series representation is a reward for performing the integration
over time.

range 0 < φ < π/2; hence the series representation of R(E) is deﬁned for φ in this range.
On the other hand, ¯R(E) is deﬁned by an integral whose contour is the negative real τ -axis,
which is mapped into the unit circle if φ lies in the range

ﬁrst observe that, according to Eq. (45), changing the sign of φ and complex conjugating
u amounts to changing τ into
t∗. It follows from Eqs. (48)
τ ∗, or, equivalently, t into
t∗), which,
and (59) that complex conjugating C(t) and changing the sign of φ yields C(
using Eq. (38), is the same as [ ¯C(t)]∗. Hence, simply changing the sign of φ, without
complex conjugation, turns C(t) into ¯C(t). Furthermore, changing the sign of φ, from
positive to negative, say, transforms the contour of integration for R(E) discontinuously into
the contour for ¯R(E); if we vary φ continuously from a positive to a negative value the
integration contour — the broken line in Fig. 3 — starts as a path in the upper semicircle, it
moves upwards towards to the boundary of this semicircle, and upon reaching this boundary
jumps discontinuously to the boundary of the lower semicircle, and from there to a path
inside the lower semicircle. Thus we have arrived at the result we set out to prove.

to our speciﬁcation that R(E) and ¯R(E), respectively, are analytic in the upper and lower

By rotating the integration contour through 90◦, from the negative real τ -axis to to the
negative imaginary τ -axis, we reproduce Eq. (99).

Thus we have justiﬁed the heuristic derivation of the series representation of the resolvent
which we gave in the Introduction. It is time to remark on other polynomial expansions of
If the Hamiltonian is represented by a ﬁnite matrix, whose minimum and
the resolvent.
maximum eigenvalues are Emin and Emax, respectively, one can, by ﬁat, expand the matrix
representation of the resolvent in any set of orthogonal polynomials that form a complete
set over a ﬁnite interval rescaled to the interval [Emin, Emax]. The most popular of these ex-
pansions uses Chebyshev or Faber polynomials [12, 13] since the evolution operator U(t) can
be expanded very eﬀectively over a ﬁnite time interval in terms of these polynomials.[13, 14]
The Chebyshev expansion has been remarkably successful in obtaining properties of bound
[15] However, notwithstanding some numerical evidence that the
and compound states.
Chebyshev and Faber expansions can yield reasonably accurate estimates of scattering am-
plitudes in some simple cases, [12, 13] it is unclear at this stage how well-suited are these
expansions for the general treatment of collision processes, particularly when the Coulomb

32

tail plays an important role, since these expansions do not discriminate between the dis-
crete and continuum parts of the spectrum of H. Recall that the long-time behavior of the
correlation amplitude is determined by spectral density at the threshold of the continuous
spectrum. The success of the Chebyshev expansion in dealing with discrete (bound and
compound) states can be understood by observing that each of these states decays exponen-
tially with increasing time in a wide sector of the complex time-plane; hence the eﬀective
time-interval over which U(t) must be expanded is relatively short. However, in a continuum
process, wavepacket spreading occurs, and its asymptotic temporal behavior is 1/t3/2 (for
short-range potentials), a rather slow fall-oﬀ with t.

5 Conclusion

We have derived a series representation of the resolvent G(E) which incorporates a com-
plex unit of time, t0eiφ, whose phase φ speciﬁes the asymptotic boundary condition, and
thereby the branch. This permits a real basis to be used to construct a matrix representa-
tion of the Hamiltonian. The foundation of our approach is the analytic continuation of the
temporal correlation function in the complex time-plane. Using analytic continuation we
can extrapolate the correlation function from a relatively small interval, of duration t0, to
an interval of asymptotically large duration. Since much of the dynamics take place during
a time that is typically only an order of magnitude larger than t0, the basis can be employed
eﬃciently and does not need to span spatial regions that are reached by the particle(s) at
times very much larger than t0, where the wavefunction takes on its asymptotic form.

counter-oscillating relative to the pre-exponential. Neglecting the co-oscillating part (its
contribution averages to zero) gives

Appendix B: Algorithms

which can be started using Q1(z) = 2z. Since Qn(z) attenuates only rather slowly as n
increases, this forward recurrence relation is fairly stable. However, a more stable, yet
somewhat less convenient, approach can be formulated by using a backward recurrence
relation for the function Bm(z) of Eq. (64), which can be derived from a standard recurrence
relation for the Bessel function. [10] We ﬁnd that

Since Bm(z) decreases exponentially as m increases, this backward recurrence relation can
be started by putting Bm+1(z) = 0 and Bm(z) = 1 for a large value of m, and by using the

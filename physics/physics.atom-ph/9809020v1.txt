Muonium

Abstract. The energy levels of the muonium (µ+e−) atom, which consists of two
”point-like” leptonic particles, can be calculated to very high accuracy in the framework
of bound state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), since there are no complications
due to internal nuclear structure and size which is the case for all atoms and ions of
natural isotopes including atomic hydrogen. The ground state hyperﬁne splitting and
the 1s-2s energy interval can provide both tests of QED theory and determinations of
fundamental constants like the muon mass mµ and the ﬁne structure constant α. The
excellent understanding of the electromagnetic binding in the muonium atom allows
in particular testing fundamental physical laws like lepton number conservation in
searches for muonium to antimuonium conversion and probing the nature of the muon
as a heavy leptonic object.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic hydrogen has played an important role in the history of modern physics.
The successful description of the spectral
lines of the hydrogen atom by the
Schr¨odinger equation [1] and especially by the Dirac equation [2] had a large impact
on the development of quantum mechanics. Precision measurements of the ground
state hyperﬁne structure splitting by Nafe, Nelson and Rabi [3,4] in the late 1940’s
were important contributions to the identiﬁcation of the magnetic anomaly of the
22P1/2 Lamb shift
electron. Together with the observation of the “classical” 22S1/2−
by Lamb and Retherford [5] they pushed the development of the modern theory of
Quantum Electrodynamics(QED).

Today the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, which is deﬁned as
2)/2, where ge is the electron g-factor, and the ground state hy-
ae = (ge −
perﬁne structure splitting ∆νH
HF S of atomic hydrogen are among the most well
known quantities in physics. Experiments in Penning traps with single elec-
10−12 to 3.7 ppb. QED cal-
trons [6] have determined ae=1 159 652 188.4(4.3)
·
culations have reached such a precision that the ﬁne structure constant α can
be extracted to 3.8 ppb [7]. Hydrogen hyperﬁne structure measurements yield
∆νH
HF S = 1 420.405 751 766 7(9) MHz (0.006 ppb) [8,9] and hydrogen masers even
have a large potential as frequency standards. However, the theoretical description

of the hyperﬁne splitting is limited to the ppm level by the fact that the proton’s
internal structure is not known well enough for calculations of nearly similar accu-
racy [10,11]. Neither can experiments supply the necessary data on the mean square
charge radius and the polarizability, for example from electron scattering, nor is
any theory, for example low energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD), in a posi-
tion to yield the protons internal charge structure and the dynamical behavior of
its charge carrying constituents. The situation is similar for the 2S1/2- 2P1/2 Lamb
shift in hydrogen, where atomic interferometer experiments ﬁnd ∆νH
2S1/2−2P1/2=
1 057.851 4(19) MHz [12] (1.8 ppm) and where the knowledge of the proton’s mean
square charge radius limits any calculations to the 10 ppm level of precision [10,11].
The 1s-2s level separation in atomic hydrogen has reached a fascinating accuracy
for optical spectroscopy and one can expect even further signiﬁcant improvements.
The Rydberg constant has been extracted to R∞= 10 973 731.568 639(91) m−1
[13,14] by comparing this transition with others in hydrogen and is now the best
known fundamental constant. However, the knowledge of the mean square charge
radius limits comparison between experiment and theory. Detailed reviews on this
topic were given by [15,16] on this conference.

∆ν1S−2S of hydrogen and some exotic hydrogen-like systems oﬀer narrow transitions for studying
the interactions in Coulomb bound two-body systems. In the exotic systems the linewidth has a
fundamental lower limit given by the ﬁnite lifetime of the systems, because of annihilation, as in
the case of positronium, or because of weak muon or pion decay. The very high quality factors
(transition frequency divided by the natural linewidth ∆ν/δν ) in hydrogen and other systems with
hadronic nuclei can hardly be utilized to test the theory because of the insuﬃciently known charge
distribution and dynamics of the charge carrying constituents within the hadrons.

†Only the 1S-2S splitting in the triplet system of positronium is considered in this table.

In addition to the information obtainable from the natural isotopes hydrogen
(pe−), deuterium (de−) and tritium (te−) or hydrogen-like ions of natural elements

AXe−)(Z−1)+), exotic hydrogen-like atoms can provide further information about
((Z
the interactions between the bound particles and the nature of these objects them-
selves [17]. Such systems can be formed by replacing the electron in a natural
atom by an exotic particle (e.g. µ−, π−, K −, p), or by electron capture of an exotic
”nucleus” (e.g. e+, µ+, π+). Even atoms consisting of two exotic particles have
been produced occasionally, e.g. π+µ− and π−µ+ were found in in-ﬂight decays of
neutral kaons K 0
L [18]. Some of the systems are compared in Table 1 with respect to
the possible spectroscopic resolution for the 1S-2S and the ground state hyperﬁne
structure transition.

Muonic atoms ((µ−A

ZX)) and ions ((µ−A

ZX)n+) are of particular interest for spec-
troscopy, since the Bohr radius aµ is about 207 times smaller for muons than for
electrons, aµ = (me/mµ)a0, where me and mµ are the masses of the electron and
10−10 m, with the electric charge unit
the muon and a0 = h¯ 2/(mee2) = 0.529
·
e and Planck’s constant h¯ . Bound muonic states are therefore more sensitive to
the properties of the nuclei. This has been widely applied for determinations of
nuclear charge moments and for examining nuclear polarization [19,20]. The muon
orbit for higher nuclear charges Z is signiﬁcantly smaller than the electron Comp-
10−13 m, which is the typical dimension of
ton wavelength λ¯C = h¯ /(mec) = 3.86
vacuum ﬂuctuations. In contrast to electronic systems, the vacuum polarization
contributions in muonic atoms are substantially larger than the self energy, since
the Uehling potential, which describes to lowest order the modiﬁcation of the nu-
clear potential due to vacuum ﬂuctuations, scales approximately with the cube of
the particle mass and the self energy is inversely proportional to it. Higher order
vacuum polarization contributions are needed for a satisfactory description.

·

There is special interest in muonic hydrogen (pµ−), since, in principle, one could
obtain from a measurement of its ground state hyperﬁne splitting and the 2S-2P
Lamb shift more detailed information on the proton’s charge radius and polariz-
ability [21,22].

The muonic helium atom ((αµ−)+e−) [23–25] consists of a pseudo-nucleus
(αµ−)+, which is itself a hydrogen-like system, and an electron. It is the simplest
atomic system involving both a negative muon and an electron. A precise value
for the magnetic moment of the negative muon has been deduced from the Zeeman
splitting of the ground state hyperﬁne structure as a test of the CPT theorem.

Already in the 1970’s the muonic helium ion (αµ−)+ was the ﬁrst exotic atomic
system for which a successful laser experiment has been reported [26,27]. Allowed
electric dipole transitions between the n=2 ﬁne structure levels have been induced.
A precise test of QED vacuum polarization could be established and the rms charge
radius of the α-particle was extracted. The experiment needed as a prerequisite
the metastability of the 2S state at high pressures (
40 bar), which could not be
conﬁrmed in several independent approaches [28–30] and a second attempt of a
laser experiment could not conﬁrm the existence of a signal [31], which leaves us
with an open puzzle.

≈

In purely hadronic systems like pionic hydrogen (pπ−) and antiprotonic hydro-
gen [32], protonium (pp) [33,34], the transition frequencies are dominantly due to
Coulomb interaction. They bear additional line shifts and broadenings in the spec-
tral lines due to strong interaction between the constituents. They oﬀer the possi-
bility to study the strong interaction between the particles at zero energy. From the
transition frequencies in pionic atoms (or possibly from the pionium atom (π+e−)
[35] one can derive a value for the pion mass [36]. At present the determination of
the best upper limit for the muon neutrino mass from the muon momentum from
pion decays at rest [37–39] is spoiled by the uncertainties of the pion mass.

For leptons no internal structure is known so far. Scattering experiments have
established that electron (e), muon(µ) and tauon (τ ) behave like point-like particles
down to dimensions of less than 10−18m [40,41] which is three orders of magnitude
below the proton’s rms charge radius [42–44]. Purely leptonic hydrogen-like sys-
tems like positronium (e+e−) [45,46] and muonium (µ+e−) [47–49] have interesting
perspectives for testing bound state QED, for searching for deviations from present
models and for testing fundamental symmetry laws.

Positronium is a particle anti-particle system and signiﬁcantly diﬀers from muo-
nium and hydrogen-like systems with diﬀerent constituent masses. The Furry pic-
ture, where the electronic states are in zeroth order solutions of the Dirac equation
in an external electrostatic ﬁeld and which is successfully applied for the heavier
systems, is not appropriate. A theoretical description must start from the fully
relativistic Bethe-Salpeter formalism or an approximation to it [50]. Depending
on the C-parity of the state, the ground state of the positronium atom annihilates
into two (11S0) or three (13S0) photons. Standard theory was conﬁrmed in various
searches for rare decay modes which have been carried out [46] in order to ﬁnd
unkown light particles, e.g. axions, or violations of fundamental laws, e.g. C-parity
symmetry. For the 3S-states annihilation into a single virtual photon causes signif-
icant shifts at the ﬁne structure level. Positronium was the second exotic system
in which laser excitation could be achieved [51]. The 1S-2S transition frequency is
known to ∆νP S
1S−2S = 1 233 607 216.4(3.2) MHz (2.6 ppb) corresponding to a test of
the QED contributions to 35 ppm [52]. The theoretical uncertainty is estimated
to be of the order of 10 MHz from uncalculated higher order (α4R∞) terms [53].
Their evaluation will be cumbersome, because of the inﬂation of the number of
Feynman diagrams due to virtual annihilation. From the result one can conclude
that electron and positron masses are equal to 2 ppb, the best test of mass equality
for particle and antiparticle next to the K 0K 0 system [54], where the relative mass
diﬀerence is

10−18.

Precision experiments on muonium oﬀer a unique opportunity to investigate
bound state QED without complications arising from nuclear structure and to test
the behavior of the muon as a heavy leptonic particle and hence the electron-muon(-
tau) universality, which is fundamentally assumed in QED theory. Of particular
interest is the ground state hyperﬁne structure splitting, where experiment [55] and
theory [10,11] agree at 300 ppb which is at a higher level of precision than in the

case of atomic hydrogen. An accurate value for the ﬁne structure constant α can
be extracted to 140 ppb. The Zeeman eﬀect of the ground state hyperﬁne sublevels
yields the most precise value for muon the magnetic moment µµ with an accuracy
of 360 ppb. Signals from the ”classical” 22S1/2-22P1/2 Lamb shift in muonium have
been observed [56,78]. However, with 1.4% precision they are not yet in a region
where they can be confronted with theory. The sensitivity to QED corrections is
highest for the 1S-2S interval in muonium due to the approximate 1/n3 scaling of
the Lamb shift. Compared to hydrogen, the radiative recoil and the relativistic
8.9, where mp is the proton mass
recoil eﬀects are larger by a factor of mp/mµ ≈
and mµ the muon mass. A hydrogen-muonium isotope shift measurement in this
transition as well as a technically only slightly more diﬃcult measurement of the
1s-2s transition frequency in muonium can lead to a new and accurate ﬁgure for
the muon mass mµ. The transition has recently been excited successfully in two
independent experiments [57–60].

tency requirement for QED and electroweak theory and the set of fundamental
constants involved. The constants α, mµ, µµ are the most stringently tested impor-
tant parameters. The only necessary external input are the hadronic corrections
to aµ which can be obtained from a measurement of the ratio of cross sections
(e+e−
hadrons). Although, in principle, the system could
provide the relevant electroweak constants, the Fermi coupling constant GF and
sin2 θW , the use of more accurate values from independent measurements may be
chosen for higher sensitivity to new physics. As a matter of fact, an improve-
ment upon the present knowledge of the muon mass at the 0.35 ppm level is very
important for the success of a new measurement of the muon magnetic anomaly
presently under way at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York.
The relevance of the experiment, which aims for 0.35 ppm accuracy, arises from its
sensitivity to contributions from physics beyond the standard model and the clean
test it promises for the renormalizability of electroweak interaction [61,62].

II GROUND STATE HYPERFINE INTERVAL

The ground state hyperﬁne splitting allows the most sensitive tests of QED for the
muon-electron interaction. An unambiguous and very precise atomic physics value
for the ﬁne structure constant α can be derived from ∆νHF S. The experimental
precision for ∆νHF S has reached the level of 0.036ppm or 160Hz which is just a
factor of two above the estimated contribution of -65Hz (15 ppb) from the weak
interaction arising from an axial vector – axial vector coupling via Z-boson exchange
[63,64]. The sign of the weak eﬀect is in muonium is opposite to the one for
hydrogen, because the positive muon is an antiparticle and the proton is a particle.
(Therefore the muonium atom may be viewed as a system which is neither pure
matter nor antimatter.)

With increased experimental accuracy muonium can be the ﬁrst atom where
a shift in atomic energy levels due to the weak interaction will be observed. A
contribution of 250 Hz (56 ppb) due to strong interaction arises from hadronic
vacuum polarization. The theoretical calculations for ∆νHF S can be improved to
the necessary precision [65]. The calculations themselves are at present accurate to
about 50ppb. However, there is a 300ppb uncertainty arising from mass µµ of the
positive muon.

All precision experiments to date have been carried out with muonium formed
by charge exchange after stopping µ+ in a suitable gas [48]. The experimental
part of such an eﬀort [73] has been completed at the Los Alamos Meson Physics
Facility (LAMPF) and the recorded data are presently being analyzed. The exper-
iment used a Kr gas target at typically atmospheric pressures and a homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld of about 1.7 Tesla. Microwave transitions between Zeeman levels
which involve a muon spin ﬂip can be detected through a change in the spatial
distribution of positrons from muon decays, since due to parity violation in the
decay process the positve muons decay with the positrons preferentially emitted in

which allowed to reduce the linewidth of the signals can be reduced below half of
τµ)−1=145kHz, where τµ is the muon lifetime
the ”natural” linewidth δνnat = (π
of 2.2 µ. For this purpose the basically continuous beam of the LAMPF stopped
muon channel was chopped by an electrostatic kicker device into 4 µs long pulses
with 14 µs separation. Only atoms which were interacting with the microwave
ﬁeld for periods longer than several muon lifetimes were detected [74]. The basi-
cally statistically limited results improve the knowledge of both zero ﬁeld hyperﬁne
splitting and muon magnetic moment by a factor of three [75,76]. The ﬁnal results
are discussed in detail in [75]. They yield for the zero ﬁeld splitting

which translates into a muon-electron mass ratio of

As the hyperﬁne splitting is proportional to the fourth power of the ﬁne structure
constant α, the improvement in α will be much better and the value is comparable
in accuracy with the value of α determined using the Quantum Hall eﬀect.

The frequencies ν12 and ν34 correspond to transitions between (a) the two energetically highest

expect a near future small improvement of the value in eq.
determinations of h¯ /me through measurements of the photon recoil in Cs atom
spectroscopy and a Cs atom mass measurement.

The limitation of α from muonium HFS, when using eq. (5), arises mainly from to
the muon mass. Therefore any better determination of the muon mass, respectively
its magnetic moment, e.g. through a precise measurement of the reduced mass shift
in the muonium 1s-2s splitting, will result in an improvement of this value of α. It
should be noted that already at present the good agreement within two standard
deviations between the ﬁne structure constant determined from muonium hyperﬁne
structure and the one from the electron magnetic anomaly is considered the best
test of internal consistency of QED, as one case involves bound state QED and the
other case QED of free particles.

The precision measurements of the muonium hyperﬁne splitting performed so
far, however, suﬀer from the interaction of the muonium atoms with the foreign
gas atoms. With the discovery of polarized thermal muonium emerging from SiO2
powder targets into vacuum [82] measurements of the ∆νHF S are now feasible
in vacuum in the absence of a perturbing foreign gas. Corrections for density

The atoms were formed by electron capture after stopping positive muons close to
the surface of a SiO2 powder target. A fraction of these diﬀused to the surface
and left the powder at thermal velocities (7.43(2) mm/µs) for the adjacent vacuum
region. A rectangular rf resonator operated in T EM301 mode was placed directly
above the muonium production target. The atoms entered the cavity with thermal
velocities through a wall opening. The e+ from the parity violating muon decay

close to the side walls of the resonator. The telescope axes have been oriented
parallel respectively antiparallel to the spin of the incoming muons which had been
rotated transverse to the muon propagation direction by an ExB separator (Wien
ﬁlter) in the muon beam line. At the resonance frequency of 4.46329(3)GHz a
reduction of the muon polarization of 16(2)% has been observed as a signal from
the hyperﬁne transitions [83].

Certainly the method needs a lot of development work in order to improve the
signal strength. However, ultimately one expects higher precision from experiments
on muonium in vacuum than from measurements in gases.

III LAMB SHIFT IN THE FIRST EXCITED STATE

The classical Lamb shift in the atomic hydrogen atom between the metastable
22S1/2 and the 22P1/2 states is totally QED in nature and seems to be ideal for
testing radiative QED corrections. An important contribution arises from the in-
ternal proton structure. Its uncertainty limits any theoretical calculation. Today,

experiment and theory agree on the 10 ppm level. The purely leptonic muonium
atom is free from nuclear structure problems. In addition, the relativistic reduced
mass and recoil contributions are about one order of magnitude larger compared
to hydrogen. Lamb shift measurements at TRIUMF [77] and LAMPF [78,79] have
reached the 10−2 level of precision.

All these measurements were carried out using fast muonium produced by a beam
foil method [80] which is the only method known to date that produces muonium
in the metastable 2S state in usefull quantities.

IV 1S-2S TRANSITION

Doppler free excitation of the 1s-2s transition has been achieved in the past at
KEK in Tsukuba, Japan, [57] and at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL)
in Chilton, Didcot, UK [59,60]. The accuracy of the last experiment was limited
by ac Stark eﬀect and a frequency chirp caused by rapid changes of the index of
refraction in the dye solutions of the laser ampliﬁer employed in the laser system.
The experiment yielded ∆ν1S−2S = 2 455 529 002 (33)(46) MH z for the centroid
1S-2S transition frequency. This value is in agreement with theory within two
standard deviations [11]. The Lamb shift contribution to the 1S-2S splitting has

been extracted to ∆νLS = 6 988 (33)(46) MHz; this the most precise experimental
Lamb shift value for muonium available today. From the isotope shifts between
the muonium signal and the hydrogen and deuterium 1S-2S two-photon resonances
we deduce the mass of the positive muon as mµ = 105.658 80 (29)(43) MeV/c2.
An alternate interpretation of the result yields the best test of the equality of the
absolute value of charge units in the ﬁrst two generations of particles at the 10−8
level [60].

A new measurement of the 1S-2S energy splitting of muonium by Doppler-free
two-photon spectroscopy has been performed at the worlds presently brightest
pulsed surface muon source which exists at RAL. Increased accuracy is expected
compared to a previously obtained value. The series of experiments aims for an
improvement of the muon mass.

The 12S1/2(F=1)

22S1/2(F=1) transition was induced by Doppler-free two-
photon laser spectroscopy using two counter-propagating laser beams of wavelength
λ = 244 nm. The necessary high power UV laser light was generated by frequency
tripling the output of an alexandrite ring laser ampliﬁer in crystals of LBO and
BBO. Typically UV light pulses of energy 3 mJ and 80 nsec (FWHM) duration
were used. The alexandrite laser was seeded with light from a continuous wave
Ti:sapphire laser at 732 nm which was pumped by an Ar ion laser. Fluctuations
of the optical phase during the laser pulse were compensated with an electro-optic
device in the resonator of the ring ampliﬁer to give a frequency chirping of the laser
light of less than about 5 MHz. The laser frequency was calibrated by frequency
modulation saturation spectroscopy of a hyperﬁne component of the 5-13 R(26)
line in thermally excited iodine vapour. The frequency of the reference line is
about 700 MHz lower than 1/6 of the muonium transition frequency. The cw
light was frequency up-shifted by passing through two acousto-optic modulators
(AOM’s). The muonium reference line has been calibrated preliminarily to 3.4 MHz
at the Institute of Laser Physics in Novosibirsk. An independent calibration at the

National Physics Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington, UK, was performed to 140 kHz
(0.35 ppb).

22S1/2(F=1) transition signal in muonium, not corrected for

The 1S-2S transition was detected by the photoionization of the 2S state by a
third photon from the same laser ﬁeld. The slow muon set free in the ionization
process is accelerated to 2 keV and guided through a momentum and energy selec-
tive path onto a microchannel plate particle detector (MCP). Background due to
scattered photons and other ionized particles can be reduced to less than 1 event
in 5 hours by shielding and by requiring that the MCP count falls into a 100 nsec
wide window centered at the expected time of ﬂight for muons and by additionally
requiring the observation of the energetic positrons from the muon decay. On res-
onance an event rate of 9 per hour was observed. The number of MCP events as a
function of the laser frequency is displayed in Fig. 6.

The line shape distortions due to frequency chirping were investigated theoreti-
cally using density matrix formalism to ﬁnd numerically the frequency dependence
of the signal for the time dependent laser intensity and the time dependent phase of
the laser ﬁeld which were both measured for every individual laser shot using fast
digitzed amplidude and optical heterodyne signals [84,85]. The model was veriﬁed
experimentally at the ppb level by observing resonances in deuterium and hydro-
gen. A careful analysis of the recorded muonium data is in progress and promisses
for the ﬁrst succesful run with the new all solid state laser system an accuracy of
order 10 MHz which is signiﬁcantly better than the previous result. The measure-
ments are still limited by properties of the laser system, in particular by the chirp
eﬀect, rather than by statistics.

It can be expected that future experiments will reach well below 1 MHz in accu-

racy promising an improved muon mass value. The theoretical value at present is
basically limited by the knowledge of recoil terms at the 0.6 MHz level. Here some
improvement of calculations will become important for the next round of experi-
ments.

V MUONIUM TO ANTIMUONIUM CONVERSION

A spontaneous conversion of muonium (M=µ+e−) into antimuonium (M =µ−e+)
would violate additive lepton family number conservation and is discussed in many
speculative theories (see Fig. 7).It would be an analogy in the lepton sector to K0-
K0 oscillations [86]. Since lepton number is a solely empirical law and no underlying
symmetry could yet be revealed, it can be reliably applied only to the level at which
it has been tested. The M-M-conversion process would in case of its existence, for
example, cause a level splitting of the muonium hyperﬁne states of order 519 Hz
GMM, where GMM is the coupling constant describing the process in an eﬀective
·
four fermion coupling. Therefore the veriﬁcation of an upper limit for such an
interaction is indispensable for a reliable extraction of fundamental constants from
spectroscopic measurements in muonium.

interaction could be mediated by (a) a doubly charged Higgs boson ∆++ [100,101], (b) heavy
Majorana neutrinos [100], (c) a neutral scalar ΦN [102], e.g. a supersymmetric τ -sneutrino ˜ντ
[95,103], or (d) a dileptonic gauge boson X ++ [104].

An experiment set up at PSI (Fig. 8) [87,88] is designed to employ the signature
developed in a predecessor experiment at LAMPF, which requires the coincident
identiﬁcation of both particles forming the antiatom in its decay [89,90]. Muonium
atoms in vacuum with thermal velocities, which are produced from a SiO2 powder
target, are observed for antimuonium decays. Energetic electrons from the decay
of the µ− in the antiatom can be observed in a magnetic spectrometer at 0.1 T
magnetic ﬁeld consisting of ﬁve concentric multiwire proportional chambers and a
64 fold segmented hodoscope. The positron in the atomic shell of the antiatom
is left behind after the decay with 13.5 eV average kinetic energy [91]. It can be

(Fig. 9). The expected background due to accidental coincidences is 1.7(2) events.

Thus an upper limit on the conversion probability of PMM ≤

sion of the conversion in the magnetic ﬁeld of the detector due to the removal of
degeneracy between corresponding levels in M and M. The reduction is strongest

This new result, which exceeds bounds from previous experiments [89,107] by a
factor of 2500 and the one from an early stage of the experiment [88] by 35, has
some impact on speculative models. A certain Z8 model is ruled out with more
than 4 generations of particles where masses could be generated radiatively with
heavy lepton seeding [108].

A new lower limit of mX±±

2.6 TeV/c2
g3l (95% C.L.) on the masses of
ﬂavour diagonal bileptonic gauge bosons in GUT models is extracted which lies
well beyond the value derived from direct searches, measurements of the muon
magnetic anomaly or high energy Bhabha scattering [104,98]. Here g3l is of order
1 and depends on the details of the underlying symmetry. For 331 models this
850 GeV/c2 which excludes their minimal Higgs version
translates into mX±±
in which an upper bound of 600 GeV/c2 has been extracted from an analysis of

≥

∗

electroweak parameters [109,110]. The 331 models may still be viable in some
extended form involving a Higgs octet [111]. In the framework of R-parity violating
supersymmetry [103,95] the bound on the coupling parameters could be lowered
10−4 for assumed superpartner masses of
by a factor of 15 to
100 GeV/c2. Further the achieved level of sensitivity allows to narrow slightly the
interval of allowed heavy muon neutrino masses in minimal left-right symmetry
[101] (where a lower bound on GMM exists, if muon neutrinos are heavier than 35
keV) to

40 keV/c2 up to the present experimental bound at 170 keV/c2.

In minimal left right symmetric models, in which MM conversion is allowed, the
process is intimately connected to the lepton family number violating muon decay
e+ + νµ + νe. With the limit achieved in this experiment this decay is not an
µ+
option for explaining the excess neutrino counts in the LSND neutrino experiment
at Los Alamos [112,113].

A future M

The consequences for atomic physics of muonium are such that the expected level
M interaction is below 1.5 Hz/√SB reas-
splitting in the ground state due to M
suring the validity of fundamental constants determined in muonium spectroscopy.
M experiment could take particularly advantage of high intense
pulsed beams. In contrast to other lepton ﬂavour violating muon decays, the con-
version through its nature as particle - antiparticle oscillation, has a time evolution
in which the probability for ﬁnding M in the ensemble remaining after muon decay
increases quadratically in time, giving the signal an advantage growing in time over
major exponentially decaying background [90].

VI LONG TERM FUTURE POSSIBILITIES

It appears that the availability of particles limits the ability to increase noticeably
the accuracy of spectroscopy experiments on muonium. Therefore any measure to
boost the particle ﬂuxes would be a very important step forward. In principle, we
need signiﬁcantly more intense accelerators, such as they are presently discussed at

various places. In the intermediate future the Japanese Hadron Facility (JHF) or
a possible European Spallation Source (ESS) are important options. Also the dis-
cussed Oak Ridge neutron spallation source could in principle accommodate intense
muon beams. The most promising facility would be, however, a muon collider [114],
the front end of which could provide muon rates 5-6 orders of magnitude higher
than present beams (see Table 4).

† Recent studies indicate that the 1011 particles/s region might be reachable [115].

At short term, at PSI the muon beam of the πE3 area could be chopped to give
pulses of typically 1 µs duration and about 10 µs separation with in total beam
106µ+/s, which would be 5 times higher rate than at LAMPF when
rates of up to 5
the recently completed muonium hyperﬁne structure experiment was performed.

·

With such improvements in the particle ﬂuxes one could expect increased accu-
racy for the muonium hyperﬁne splitting and the muon magnetic moment. For the
1s-2s splitting a cw laser experiment could just about become feasible as well as
many other important laser experiments [116,117] With the large number of very
interesting possibilities for measuring fundamental constants and testing of basic
physical laws muonium spectroscopy appears to be as lively as is now for almost
three decades.

1 Introduction

In an ongoing experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) the

strong interaction broadening of the ground state level of pionic hydrogen of

about 1 eV should be determined with an accuracy of less than 10 meV by mea-

suring the line shape of X-ray transitions feeding the atomic 1s state [1,2,3].

The energies of the pionic hydrogen X-rays in question are 2.436, 2.886 and

3.043 keV for the 2p-1s, 3p-1s and 4p-1s transitions, respectively. The exper-

iment uses a Bragg spectrometer in Johann mounting [4] and was equipped

during recent measurements with spherically bent silicon or quartz crystals

having a diameter of 100 mm and a thickness of 0.3 mm or 0.2 mm, respec-

tively. The curvature radius RC of the bent crystals is RC= 2982.5±0.6 mm.

For these parameters bent crystal theory predicts a negligible inﬂuence of the

bending process on the crystal’s rocking curve [5]. Imperfections in the crys-

tal material itself and defects produced during the fabrication could lead to

deviations which should be determined experimentally. In order to meet the

requirements imposed by the pionic hydrogen experiment a determination of

the spectrometer’s response function requires at least 20000 events in the cali-

bration line. Moreover the measurement should be performed under conditions

equivalent to the real experiment.

In earlier experiments a rough energy calibration was done by using X-rays

from geometrically extended ﬂuorescence targets excited by means of X-ray

tubes [6]. A determination of the response function is out of reach with this

method as the natural line widths are much broader than the resolution of

the spectrometer. In addition the shape of these lines is distorted by satellite

transitions.

Alternating the pionic hydrogen measurement in regular intervals with cali-

bration experiments using narrow X-ray lines from other exotic atoms would

be ideal. The measured low count rates of about 100/hour, however, render

such an approach unfeasible.

The use of X-rays emitted from highly ionized ions therefore oﬀers an ap-

propiate solution albeit in a remote measurement. It makes use of the fact

that for low to medium Z atoms the E1 X-rays from hydrogen-like ions as

well as M1 X-rays from helium-like ions have natural line widths negligibly

small compared to the expected resolution of the Bragg crystals. To give an

example, the lifetime of the M1 transition of helium-like argon used mostly

in the present study is 0.21 µs only [7]. The required X-rays are emitted in

copious quantities from ECR or EBIT sources. ECR sources are preferable as

the X-rays are emitted from a geometrically extended region important for a

Johann set-up whereas EBIT sources produce X-rays in the region of the very

compressed electron beam only, which would require an observation perpendic-

ular to the electron beam cutting down the accepted intensity considerably.

Decisive, however, is the low kinetic energy of the ions in ECR sources on

3

the level of less than 1eV only, which had been determined at diﬀerent ECR

sources with high resolution optical spectroscopy [8,9]. From this a Doppler

broadening of less than 40 meV can be expected for transitions around 3 keV

energy in helium-like argon. In principle EBIT sources could be tuned to low

kinetic energies of the captured ions by reducing the voltage of the drift tube,

which, however, results in a drastic reduction in intensity [10].

The intention of this paper is much diﬀerent from earlier publications using

crystal spectrometers in combination with ECR sources. Those mostly aimed

at a determination of plasma properties leading to a deeper understanding of

the processes governing the physics of these sources [11,12,13]. Here, for the

ﬁrst time the characterisation of a crystal spectrometer with a narrow X-ray

line from an almost completely ionized atom is described. For this purpose the

transition from helium-like argon at 3.104 keV [7] close in energy to the 4p-1s

transition in pionic hydrogen was used.

2 Experimental set-up

The experiment as depicted in Figure 1 can be subdivided into three parts:

• The Electron-Cyclotron Resonance Ion Trap (ECRIT) consists out of a

superconducting split coil magnet, which together with special iron in-

serts, provides the mirror ﬁeld conﬁguration, an AECR-U style permanent

hexapole magnet and a 6.4 GHz power regulated microwave emitter [14].

The mirror ﬁeld parameters provide one of the highest mirror ratios for

ECR sources with a value of 4.3 over the length of the plasma chamber.

The hexapole is cooled at the front pieces and on the inner radius by a

4

forced ﬂow of demineralised water. The plasma chamber is formed by a 0.4

mm thick stainless steel tube of inner diameter of 85 mm and a length of 265

mm axially limited by copper inserts. At the position of the hexapole gap

the stainless steel tube is perforated by a series of 2.5 mm diameter holes

allowing for radial pumping in addition to axial pumping. The microwave

HF power is introduced directly to the plasma chamber with waveguides

exhibiting a small angle to the axis. In this way the path of the X-rays

was at no point cut by any obstacle which could distort the shape of the

response function.

An extraction voltage of 2 kV had been routinely applied at the side

opposite to the crystal spectrometer. The measurement of the current drawn

served as a control for a stable operation.

A reference pressure (without plasma) of 1.7 10−7 mbar was achieved.

Gas ﬁlling was supplied radially by UHV precision leak valves through the

gaps in the open structure hexapole. The gas composition was routinely

surveyed with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. For an optimised plasma

source a drastic increase of the number of energetic electrons was discovered

which required the use of a cleaning magnet installed at a distance of one

meter in front of the crystal.

• A silicon(111) as well as a quartz(10¯1) crystal were investigated, which had

been recently applied for measuring pionic hydrogen transitions [15]. The

Bragg angles ΘB, corresponding to the M1 transition of helium-like argon

with an energy of 3.104 keV, are ΘB= 36.68◦ for the quartz and ΘB=39.57◦

for the silicon crystal. The crystals were installed at a distance of 2330 mm

from the centre of the ECRIT resulting in a position of the plasma about

500 mm outside the Rowland circle.

• A CCD pixel detector with a pixel size 40 µm x 40 µm and an energy

5

resolution of 140 eV at 3 keV was used to detect the X-rays [18]. The

detector consisted out of six chips with 600 x 600 pixels each resulting in

a total height of 72 mm and a width of 48 mm. The distance of the CCD

detector from the crystal could be changed remotely over a length of 86 mm

without breaking the vacuum.

The CCD detector and the following electronics were protected against

light as well as the HF stray ﬁeld by a 30 µm thick Beryllium window

installed in the vacuum tube in front of the CCD cryostat.

3 Tuning the ECRIT

In a ﬁrst step with low HF power and minimum ﬁeld values around 1.4 kG the

proper working of the whole set-up was checked with X-rays of low ionisation

degree. In consequence the HF power was gradually increased and with the

Bragg angles set to the proper values for a simultaneous observation of the

well separable X-rays from both Ar10+ and Ar11+ an optimum for the HF

power was found at about 450 Watt. The turn-around time from introducing

a change of parameters to the evaluation of a measurement was about one

minute. Going to Bragg angles valid for higher ionisation degrees the strength

of the mirror ﬁeld as well as the argon pressure were optimised for a maximum

intensity of X-rays from highly ionised atoms. In addition a gas mixture Ar/O2

with a mixing ratio of 1:9 was found to be necessary to achieve this goal [16].

The working pressure was 1.4 10−6 mbar. After a total tuning time of 10 hours

the M1 transition 3S1-1S0 at 3104 eV in Ar16+could be observed as shown in

Figure 2. The typical illumination time of the CCD chips of 1 min before

readout resulted in a high probability of double hits per pixel even in the M1

6

peak. In order to reduce the intensity and especially in order to improve the

peak/background ratio an aluminium collimator was inserted at a distance of

185 mm from the centre of the plasma into the direction of the crystal. It left

a free hole with the dimensions 16 mm(horizontal) x 10 mm(vertical), which

was wide enough not to inﬂuence the measurement of the response function.

A 6.4 GHz emitter proved to be suﬃcient to provide a highly intensive source

of M1 X-rays from Ar16+ ions in the special hybrid magnetic structure used

with radial pumping together with the gas mixing technique. After turning

the system on, it worked in a stable and reproducible way after about one

hour warm up time. The observation of the X-rays alone was suﬃcient for a

successful tuning in a short time thus making the usual momentum analysis

of extracted ions superﬂuous. There was no measurable eﬀect of the applied

extraction voltage on the intensities of the X-rays for values between 0 and 6

kV, which is the maximum achievable voltage.

4 Response function of the crystal spectrometer

With the ECR source a number of 20000 events was reached for the narrow

M1 transition of helium-like Argon in about 30 minutes time to be compared

with a number of 5000 counts reached after 40 hours with X-rays from pionic

methane. A total of about 10 hours was needed, however, to determine the

spectrometer’s response function in suﬃcient detail including changes of the

distance CCD detector-crystal (focal scans) and changing apertures in front of

the crystals. The measurements were confronted with theoretical predictions

using the following procedure:

7

• The XOP program package [17] was used as a theoretical reference for the

present measurements. It provided a theoretical rocking curve for a ﬂat ideal

crystal.

• The theoretical rocking curve was used as input for a Monte Carlo X-ray

tracking routine. With it the Bragg reﬂection of a spherically bent crystal

was calculated for the geometrical conditions of the special set-up parame-

ters like source diameter, detector position and aperture at the crystal.

• The output of the tracking routine can be considered to be the theoretical

limit of the response function which under ideal circumstances would re-

produce the data. In order to allow for additional broadening this response

function is folded with a Gaussian distribution. Its width was determined

with a least square ﬁtting of the data using the program package MINUIT

from the CERN program library. The statistics of the Monte Carlo response

function was chosen high enough not to contribute to the error of the ﬁt.

Two types of changes in the experimental set-up were investigated with this

procedure. At ﬁrst spectra were taken for diﬀerent distances of the CCD de-

tector from the crystals (focal scans). In a second step with the CCD detector

located at the focal position diﬀerent apertures were mounted in front of the

crystals.

The focal scans served the two purposes:

• to verify the optimum focal position, which is given by RCsinΘB. For this

position the width of the response function should be at minimum. The min-

imum was searched for by moving the CCD in steps of 2-3 mm in direction

to and from the crystal.

• to measure the line shape variations as a function of the crystal-detector

8

distance which served as a check of the validity of X-ray tracking calcula-

tions.

An example of a spectrum far oﬀ focus is shown in Figure 3 for the quartz

crystal with the CCD detector shifted by 12.5 mm from the focal position

into the direction of the crystal. The ﬁt allowing for an additional Gaussian

broadening reproduces the measured spectrum in detail.

In a second step the measured response function was compared with the sim-

ulated response function, as function of the crystal’s reﬂection surface. This

was achieved by applying apertures in front of the crystal and allowed the

study of possible irregularities in the response function due to crystal mate-

rial imperfections and/or deviations from the spherical shape. Four diﬀerent

apertures were used: two circular ones with openings of diameter 40 mm and

60 mm, respectively and two rectangular ones with horizontal openings of 40

mm and 60 mm, respectively, and a free diameter of 95 mm elsewhere. In ta-

ble 1 the results for the theoretical response function are confronted with the

measurement. Both lineshapes were ﬁtted with a single Gaussian and result

in the values for the FWHM depicted in columns 2 and 3. The rocking curve

width for a plane crystal, as obtained by XOP, ﬁtted by a single Gaussian

resulted in FWHM values of 106.6 µrad for silicon and 97.4 µrad for quartz.

The diﬀerence between the FWHM of the spectrometer’s response function

and the crystal’s rocking curve reﬂects expected geometrical contributions

mainly due to the horizontal extension of the crystal (Johann broadening).

In order to cope with the diﬀerence of the measured response function to the

theoretical one, a least square ﬁtting of the data was done with the width of a

Gaussian folded with the theoretical response function as ﬁt parameter. The

9

result of this ﬁt is shown in the fourth column and is considered to be the

main result of the present investigation.

The Si crystal shows an additional Gaussian contribution of 34.1(1.8) µrad

as an average of all apertures chosen. This can be interpreted as an overall

deviation of the crystal geometry from spherical shape eventually caused by

the production process or by a failure in the crystal material. For quartz the

three smaller apertures show an additional broadening on average of about

24.2(1.8) µrad, but opening the aperture to 60 mm rectangular results in a

considerable worsening. This points to an irregularity in the crystal material

or its mounting in the upper and/or lower part of the reﬂecting surface and

will be investigated in a future measurement for this special crystal.

The diﬀerent dispersions of 3.756 meV/µrad for Si and 4.166 meV/µrad for

quartz result in an energy resolution of about 478(6) meV for the Si crystal

and 506(8) meV for the quartz crystal, both equipped with a 60 mm horizontal

aperture. Going to 60 mm circular aperture these values reduce to 456(8) meV

in the case of Si and to 459(6) meV in the case of quartz.

The result of a measurement for a circular aperture with a free diameter of 60

mm is shown in Figure 4 for the quartz crystal together with the corresponding

ﬁt.

In terms of energy resolution the values for the additional Gaussian correspond

to 100(8) meV for quartz and to 128(6) meV for Si. Being diﬀerent they cannot

be caused by a common Doppler broadening caused by the motion of the argon

ions. Moreover it should be recalled that from optical measurements an upper

limit for the Doppler broadening of about 40 meV had been obtained [8,9].

10

Compared to the total width of the response functions the Doppler broadening

can be neglected and the present accuracy is suﬃcient for the determination

of the strong interaction width in pionic hydrogen. As the response function

has been measured at 3.104 keV only, its shape has to be extrapolated to the

lower energies of the diﬀerent pionic hydrogen transitions. If one interpretes the

additional Gaussian broadening as resulting from a geometrical deformation

only this extrapolation is straightforward and the Gaussian broadening can

be folded into the rocking curve before the X-ray tracking is performed.

5 Conclusion and Outlook

The characterisation of two large area spherically bent crystals was performed

with M1 X-rays from helium-like argon with two orders of magnitude higher

statistics than achievable with exotic atoms. The geometrical conditions of

the characterisation were equivalent to the pionic hydrogen experiment. The

measurement could be understood in terms of a Monte-Carlo X-ray tracking

routine allowing, however, for an additional Gaussian broadening. ¿From this a

prescription for extrapolating the result to diﬀerent energies became possible.

In future it is planned to improve on the peak/background ratio by insertion

of a proper slit of tapered material with a hole of 1 mm(vertical) x 30 mm

(horizontal) near the plasma chamber in the direction of the crystal.

In addition the achievable pressure will be optimised in reducing the sur-

face of the iron insertion pieces drastically. The use of M1 transitions from

helium-like chlorine ( supplied from the gaseous compound CHClF2, chlorodi-

ﬂuoromethane ) and helium-like sulfur from SO2 is envisaged for future ex-

11

periments as a countercheck of the assumptions and conclusions made here.

The energies at 2.430 and 2.756 keV, respectively, are close to the 2p-1s and

the 3p-1s transition energies in pionic hydrogen.

Additionally a thorough investigation of X-ray intensities as a function of

its radial origin inside the plasma is feasible with the special set-up of the

crystal spectrometer. The described set-up allows to determine the Doppler

broadening from the ion velocity distribution directly with crystals with better

resolution. Similarly the observation of such a broadening as a function of the

power and frequency injected into the ECR source may be studied.

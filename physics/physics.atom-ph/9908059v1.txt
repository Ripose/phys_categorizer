Abstract

CS2 is identiﬁed as a molecule for which distinction can be made between

dynamic and geometric alignment induced by intense laser ﬁelds. Measured

anisotropic angular distributions of fragment ions arise from (i) dynamic align-

ment of the S-C-S axes along the laser polarization vector for 35-ps laser pulses

and (ii) geometric alignment due to an angle-dependent ionization rate in the

case of 100-fs pulses. Results of classical calculations of the alignment dy-

namics support our observations. By comparing mass spectra obtained with

linearly- and circularly-polarized light it is not possible to distinguish between

dynamic and geometric alignment.

Prevailing wisdom on the spatial alignment of molecules in intense laser ﬁelds has been

challenged in two recent reports [1,2]. The possibility of spatially aligning molecules using

strong light has attracted much attention since the pioneering double-pulse experiments of

Normand et al. and Dietrich et al. [3] appeared to ﬁrmly establish that the ﬁeld associ-

ated with intense, linearly-polarized, laser light of picosecond duration induces suﬃciently

strong torques on an initially-randomly oriented ensemble of linear diatomic molecules for

reorientation of internuclear axis to occur. Experimental manifestation of such alignment

is the anisotropic angular distribution of fragments produced upon subsequent dissociative

ionization of molecules: ion intensities are maximum in the direction of the laser polarization

vector and minimum (frequently zero) in the orthogonal direction. Earlier work on diatomic

molecules has been extended to triatomics and polyatomics [4]and recently for neutrals [5];

much of the interest in the alignment of the internuclear axis ( referred to in the current

literature as dynamic alignment) in molecules has been generated because of tantalizing

possibilities of pendular-state spectroscopy [6] and coherent control experiments [7]. Now,

results of experiments conducted by Posthumus et al. [1] and by Ellert and Corkum [2] oﬀer

indications that when a linearly-polarized light ﬁeld acts on molecules whose constituent

atoms are heavy (such as iodine-containing diatomics and polyatomics), laser-induced dy-

namic alignment may not occur. The angular distributions of the products of dissociative

ionization in such cases might be determined essentially by the dependence of the ionization

rate on the angle made by the laser polarization (conventionally referred to as photoion-

ization anisotropy) vector with the molecule’s symmetry axis [1,2]. For a given value of

laser intensity, the rate of ionization is largest for those molecules whose internuclear axis

lies parallel to the direction of the laser polarization vector. The observed anisotropy of

the fragment ion angular distribution is therefore determined by a purely geometric ﬀect

- namely the angle made by the molecule with the light ﬁeld direction. Moreover, this

increase in ionization rate maximizes at a critical internuclear distance at which the least

bound electron localizes on one atomic core and the ﬁeld of the other core adds to the laser

ﬁeld, causing the elongated molecule to ﬁeld ionize. Posthumus et al. [1] have presented a

2

classical model for such enhanced ionization in which it is not necessary to invoke dynamic

alignment in order to account for anisotropic angular distributions of the products of laser-

ﬁeld-induced dissociative ionization of I2. In the light of these developments, it is clearly

important to reassess the contribution of dynamic and geometric alignment to the observed

anisotropy of angular distributions of fragment ions, especially when femtosecond duration

light pulses are used to ﬁeld ionize molecules.

Proper theoretical insight into the extent of alignment obtained when molecules are

irradiated by intense laser ﬁelds is diﬃcult to attain due, essentially, to unknown values

of polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities of the gamut of electronic states that might be

accessed in the course of dissociative ionization. As noted by Ellert and Corkum [2], it is

of much importance to experimentally assess the extent to which the angular anisotropies

measured in earlier picosecond and femtosecond experiments are actually due to dynamic

alignment. To this end we report here the results of experiments on the linear triatomic,

CS2, using picosecond laser beams (35 ps, 532 nm) in the intensity range 1013 W cm−2

and femtosecond beams (100 fs, 806 nm) in the range 1013 W cm−2- 1015 W cm−2. CS2,

along with its valence isoelectronic companion, CO2, is the archetypal triatomic system that

has been subjected to many experimental studies. In the context of the present work, it

also represents a species on the boundary between ‘heavy’ molecules (such as I2 and its

derivatives) on the one hand, and lighter species (like H2, N2) on the other. On the basis of

our experiments, we identify CS2 as the molecule that undergoes dynamic alignment when

irradiated by long (35-ps) pulses; on the other hand, 100-fs pulses give rise to anisotropic

fragment ion distributions that can be accounted for in terms to geometric alignment.

In our femtosecond experiments, light pulses (of wavelength 806 nm) were obtained from a

high-intensity, Ti:S, chirped pulse ampliﬁed, 100-fs laser operating at 10 Hz repetition rate.

The laser light was focused using a biconvex lens, of focal length 10 cm, in an ultrahigh

vacuum chamber capable of being pumped down to a base pressure of 3×10−11 Torr. We

used operating pressures of ≤8×10−8 Torr (i.e. well below the pressure at which space

charge eﬀects will alter the results). Ions produced in the laser-molecule interaction zone

3

were analyzed by a two-ﬁeld, linear time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer. To study the spatial

distribution of ions produced in the focal zone, apertures of diﬀerent sizes were inserted

before the detector in order to spatially limit the interaction volume being sampled. In the

present series of measurements we used circular apertures, of 2 mm and 15 mm diameter,

centered about the focal point. In the former case only the Rayleigh range (2.4 mm) was

sampled while in the latter instance the lowest intensity accessed was 5×1012 W cm−2 for

a peak laser intensity of 2×1015 W cm−2. Details of our apparatus and methodology are

presented elsewhere [9]. Our picosecond experiments used the second harmonic from an

Nd:YAG laser producing 35-ps long light pulses. Here, the ions formed were analyzed by

either a quadrupole mass spectrometer or a TOF device. This apparatus has also been

described in a number of earlier publications [4].

Typical angular distributions measured for S+ and S2+ fragments are shown in Fig.1.

The polarization angle was varied by means of a halfwave plate, with on-line monitoring of

the laser intensity to ensure a constant value in the course of measurements with diﬀerent

polarizations. The angular distributions for S+ and S2+ (and for higher charge states of

S-ions that are not shown in the ﬁgure) are clearly very anisotropic, with many more ions

being produced in the direction of the laser polarization vector than in an orthogonal direc-

tion. This holds for both 35-ps and 100-fs duration laser pulses. A priori, it is not possible

to deduce whether the observed anisotropy is due to dynamic or geometric eﬀects. Follow-

ing the prescription articulated by Posthumus et al. [1], we distinguish between dynamic

alignment on the one hand and the eﬀects of angle-dependent ionization rates (geometric

alignment) on the other by probing the ratio of fragment ion yields obtained with orthogonal

laser polarizations over a range of laser intensities. Fig. 2 depicts the variation with laser

intensity of the ratio of S +

⊥ (and the corresponding ratio for S2+ and S3+ ions), where
the subscripts k and ⊥ denote, respectively, the S+ yield at angles of 0◦ and 90◦ between

k /S +

the laser polarization vector and the axis of the TOF spectrometer. In the case of geometric

alignment, it would be expected that the ⊥-component becomes enhanced as the laser inten-

4

sity is increased. Consequently, the S +

k /S +

⊥ ratio would fall with increasing laser intensity.

Our 100-fs results indeed indicate this: signiﬁcant falls occur in the S +

k /S +

⊥ , S 2+

k /S 2+

⊥ and

k /S 3+
S 3+

⊥

ratios as the laser intensity is increased from 1013 to 1015 W cm−2. Geometric

alignment clearly dominates the spatial alignment process in this case. However, Fig. 2 also

shows that when 35-ps duration laser pulses are used, of intensity in the 1013 W cm−2 range,

the opposite eﬀect is observed. The S +

k /S +

⊥ ratio now increases with laser intensity. Similar

observations were also made for S2+ ions. Dynamic alignment of CS2 clearly occurs when

we use longer-duration (35-ps) laser pulses.

In order to gain some intuitive insight into the diﬀerent behavior obtained with short

and long pulses, we have carried out calculations of the alignment dynamics by solving the

classical equation of motion for a rigid rotor in an electric ﬁeld (see (1)), for diﬀerent laser

intensities and pulse durations. These calculations provide information on the nature of the

torques that are experienced by the molecule in the time evolution of the laser pulse. The

interaction of the radiation ﬁeld with CS2 is, in the ﬁrst approximation, governed by the

molecular polarizability, α = αk − α⊥, where the ﬁrst and second terms refer, respectively,

to polarizability components parallel to and perpendicular to the molecular bond. Following

Landau and Lifshitz [10] we express the angular acceleration of the internuclear axes as

¨θ = −

sin2θ,

αǫ2
2I

(1)

where θ is the polar angle between the S-C-S axis and the light ﬁeld, ǫ is the ﬁeld strength,

and I is the moment of inertia of the molecule about its centre of mass. We assume cylin-

drical symmetry and ignore higher-order terms involving α2. There is no permanent dipole

contribution since we take CS2 to remain linear even in a strong external ﬁeld. The align-

ment dynamics calculated by us are depicted in Fig. 3 for a range of laser intensities. The

time-dependent light pulse is taken to be a gaussian multiplied by a cosine function (the

intensity envelopes of our 100-fs and 35-ps pulses are shown as the solid lines in Fig. 3). As

the light intensity increases, a torque is exerted on the molecule, causing reorientation along

the polarization vector. Further increases in intensity lead to ionization, bond stretching

5

and multiple electron ejection (and consequent dissociation). Since eqn. (1) only accounts

for the ﬁrst of these steps, the reorientation time that is obtained is to be regarded as a

lower limit. Using 100-fs pulses at intensities <1014 W cm−2, our results indicate that no

signiﬁcant reorientation of the S-C-S molecule occurs. For peak intensities in the 1014 W

cm−2 range, there is signiﬁcant reorientation; the angle changes from 0.75 to 0.45 radians

in the time taken for the laser pulse to reach an intensity of ∼5×1013 W cm−2. Since this

intensity is well above the S+ appearance threshold (Fig. 2), the extent of reorientation is

clearly overestimated in our calculations. For higher peak intensities (∼1015 W cm−2), our

results indicate that although the torque generated by the laser ﬁeld is suﬃcient to bring the

molecule in line with the polarization vector, the angular velocity imparted in the process

is large enough to cause oscillations about the polarization axis such that there is no overall

alignment. Fig. 3b shows the corresponding calculations for 35-ps laser pulses. For peak

intensities above 1012 W cm−2, the molecular axis becomes coincident with the polarization

vector very early in the time evolution of the laser pulse. Thereafter, small amplitude oscil-

lations are seen. Such a system would be expected to show dynamic alignment, as is indeed

seen in our experiments.

An obvious, but presently unavoidable, shortcoming in our calculations is in our use of

α-values that pertain to CS2 in its ground electronic state. The value of αk will increase

substantially with applied ﬁeld, as the bond elongates and the electron density distribution

is distorted from its ground-state morphology. No information exists on how, and to what

extent, such enhancement occurs. In addition, contributions from the hyperpolarizabilities

(which are expected to be substantial at these laser intensities) must also be considered in

a proper description [11]. Nevertheless, the qualitative insight that these model calculations

yield is encouraging in that there is consistency with our experimental observations.

We note that the prescription used by Ellert and Corkum [2] in order to distinguish

between dynamic and geometric alignment in iodine and iodine-containing molecules was to

measure the fragmentation pattern using linearly- and circularly-polarized light of intensi-

ties such that the same ﬁeld strengths were obtained in both cases. Identical fragmentation

6

patterns were taken as evidence against dynamic alignment. An assumption that is implicit

in such an approach is that circularly-polarized light can be treated as a combination of two

perpendicular, linearly-polarized components. However, on the basis of recent experiments,

it is our contention that the dynamics resulting from irradiation of molecules by circularly-

polarized light cannot, a priori, be expected to be a linear combination of the dynamical

eﬀects due to linearly polarized light aligned parallel and perpendicular to the molecular

symmetry axis. Circularly-polarized light imparts angular momentum to the molecule that

is being irradiated, whereas linearly-polarized light does not. How this might aﬀect molecular

dynamics in intense laser ﬁelds is an issue that has not been properly addressed. Exper-

iments that we have recently conducted on intense-ﬁeld-induced multiple ionization of N2

[12] reveal that the polarization state of the incident light aﬀects the ionization spectrum

in the following fashion: when using circularly-polarized light, we observe a distinct sup-

pression of ionization channels compared to the situation pertaining to linearly-polarized

light of the same ﬁeld strength. Moreover, an enhancement of lower-energy pathways to

dissociation is apparent in the case of circular polarization. We believe that this may reﬂect

the importance of high angular momentum intermediate states that may be accessed when

circularly-polarized light is used. Such states present “wider” centrifugal barriers to disso-

ciative ionization; this manifests itself in the increasing importance of longer tunneling time

pathways that our data on N q+

2

ions [12] indicate.

In the case of CS2 molecules also, we observe signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the pattern of

dissociative ionization between circularly- and linearly-polarized light. By way of example,

we show in Fig. 4 the fragmentation pattern obtained, at two laser intensities, using linearly-

polarized light that is aligned parallel and perpendicular to the TOF axis, as well as with

circularly-polarized light. The ion yield obtained with circularly- polarized light is uniformly

lower than that obtained with linear polarization, parallel as well as perpendicular (the CS +
2

peak at the higher laser intensity is not taken into account in this comparison as the ion

signal was saturated). Note that fragment ion yields obtained with parallel polarization

are higher than corresponding yields obtained with circular-polarization, even when the

7

magnitudes of the electric ﬁeld components in the latter are a factor of three larger than in

the former. Hence, comparison of ion yields obtained with linear and circular polarization

cannot give unambiguous evidence for or against dynamic alignment, and it is for this reason

that we opt to rely on data shown in Fig. 2 to make deductions about geometric alignment

being responsible for the anisotropic angular distributions that are obtained for fragment

ions when CS2 molecules are immersed in 100-fs-long laser pulses.

Hitherto, discussions of polarization eﬀects in molecules have tended to focus only on

classical aspects of spatial alignment resulting from induced dipole moments in intense light

ﬁelds. The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the polarization state of light is also of fun-

damental importance in a quantum mechanical sense in that it aﬀects molecular ionization

yields and dissociation pathways. It is clear that such considerations need to be incorporated

in development of adequate descriptions of molecular dynamics in intense light ﬁelds.

We thank the Department of Science and Technology for substantial ﬁnancial support

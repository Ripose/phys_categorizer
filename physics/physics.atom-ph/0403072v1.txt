Abstract

The status of our understanding of relativistic sum rules is re-
viewed. The recent development of new theoretical methods for the
evaluation of these sum rules oﬀers hope for further advances in this
challenging ﬁeld. These new techniques are described, along with a
discussion of the source of diﬃculties inherent in such relativistic cal-
culations. A connection is pointed out between certain sum rules for
atomic interactions with charged particles and those for interactions
with photons.

1 Introduction

In the theory of energy deposition from fast, charged particles and from
photons, sums of quantum mechanical matrix elements weighted by a power
of energy can play an important role [1, 2, 3]. While the matrix elements
involved depend explicitly on the excited states of the system under consid-
eration, these sums can often be shown to depend solely on properties of that
system’s ground state. Such a demonstration involves the use of closure, and
the resulting expressions are known as “sum rules”. In this article, I review
work on these sum rules for the case of a relativistic target.

As an illustration of such weighted sums of matrix elements, calculations
of the average energy transfer in descriptions of scattering processes lead to
sums of the form,

describing the target system, A is an operator representing an interaction

. For a dipole interaction, A = z, Eq. (1)
of the target’s initial state
becomes the well-known Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum, whereas with
A = ei~q·~r/¯h it is the Bethe sum, with ~q the momentum transferred to the
target, and z and ~r are position operators. A non-relativistic theory of photon
~pei~k·~r, where ~ǫ and ¯h~k are the
absorption involves the interaction A = ~ǫ
polarization and momentum of the absorbed photon, the magnitude of the
latter being related to the energy transfer by ¯hk = Eni/c. A relativistic
theory for photoabsorption has a similar form, but the momentum operator
~p is replaced by the Dirac matrix, ~α.

In this paper, I will discuss the eﬀects of relativity on this and other sum
rules. Unlike their NR counterparts, calculations of relativistic sum rules
are fraught with diﬃculties. These diﬃculties can generally be traced to
the presence of negative energy states, or from another point of view, the
existence of positrons. Let us see what happens if we simply replace HS in
Eq. (3) by the Dirac Hamiltonian,

Then,

a result of the fact that HD is linear in the momentum operator. There is
obviously no way that this result can reduce to that obtained in the NR
calculation, indicating that there is something seriously wrong. It is not dif-
of negative energy have
ﬁcult to show that transitions into ﬁnal states
precisely canceled transitions into those with energies that are positive [4]. In
a relativistic theory and assuming the system is initially in its ground state,
the negative energy states are all ﬁlled (“Dirac sea”), so that transitions
into these states are speciﬁcally forbidden by Pauli’s exclusion principle. Of
course, our naive approach utilizing closure in the Dirac representation au-
tomatically includes these forbidden transitions. To obtain sensible results
for relativistic sum rules, a method must be found to impose the exclusion
principle by projecting out the negative energy states.

The case of photoabsorption has additional diﬃculties, since the operator
A appearing in the matrix elements then includes an exponential of Eni. One
might again try eliminating the explicit dependence on En in favor of H, by

but because of the fact that H and z do not commute, this relation is not
even correct. Therefore, as will be discussed below, calculations of photoab-
sorption sum rules have resorted to expansions of the exponential in powers
of Eniz, under the assumption of long-wavelengths, and keeping only the ﬁrst
few terms in the expansion.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In the next section, I discuss how
studies of interactions between atoms and charged particles or photons lead to
a consideration of sum rules. In Section 3, I review early eﬀorts to evaluate
these sum rules using a relativistic model of the target. Following this in
Section 4, I present the results of my own work on this subject, studying
the relativistic Bethe sum rule in the context of stopping power or mean
energy loss from charged projectiles. I also demonstrate a close relationship
between other sums that arise in the context of charged particle scattering
and those related to studies of photon absorption. In Section 5, I consider
relativistic sum rules from the perspective of Dirac’s hole theory, and oﬀer
some thoughts on how the inﬁnities present in this theory – of energy and of
the number of electrons – lead to diﬃculties similar to those described above
in the context of a single-particle theory. Finally, a conclusion is given in
Section 6.

2 Origin of sum rules

In this section, I review basic ideas concerning interactions between atoms
and either charged particles or photons, and show how sum rules arise in
such contexts.
I begin in Sec. 2.1 with a discussion of the interaction of
fast, charged particles with matter, and then in Sec. 2.2 describe the case of
photoabsorption.

2.1 Scattering of fast, charged particles

In the ﬁrst-Born approximation, the diﬀerential scattering cross-section (DCS)
for an excitation of the target to a state of energy En by a fast, charged pro-
jectile may be written in the Coulomb gauge as [5]

Here, ~v is the initial velocity, and z the atomic number, of the projectile, and
mc2 is known as the recoil energy. The component of
Q = √m2c4 + q2c2
~β = ~v/c perpendicular to ~q is denoted by ~βt. The quantities, Fn and ~Gn in
Eq. (7), are deﬁned by

where Z is the atomic number of the target atoms. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (7)
is referred to as the longitudinal interaction and may readily be derived using
the static, unretarded Coulomb interaction. The other term, that containing
~Gn, corresponds to the exchange of a single, transverse photon and is referred
to as the transverse interaction.

Use of Eq. (7) leads to consideration of sums in various contexts. An
important example is the calculation of the stopping power, or mean energy
loss per unit pathlength from the projectile [6, 7]. This is found from dσn as

dE

and the prime on the summation symbol means the sum is restricted by
energy conservation, such that there is a maximum energy transfer, Eni <
EM ax. From Eq. (7), it is seen that the above equation involves an integral
over the recoil energy. It turns out from kinematic considerations that the
range of this integration is Qm < Q < QM ax, where the minimum is related
ni/2mv2, and QM ax = 2mv2(M/m)2, with
to the energy transfer as Qm = E2
M the projectile mass [1, 5]. Since the sum does not include a complete
set of states of the target system, closure may not immediately be used to

6

perform the summation. Nonetheless, it has been argued [5] that it is a
n,
good approximation to extend this sum to include all energies,
as long as one also replaces the upper limit of the Q-integral with QM =
v2/c2). The errors incurred by this replacement are part of the
2mv2/(1
much studied shell corrections [8, 9, 10, 11].

It is advantageous to perform the summation before the integration, but one
must ﬁrst account for the fact that the lower limit of integration depends
explicitly on En. A common approach is to split the Q-integral into two parts:
the low- and high-Q regimes, separated by a cutoﬀ, Qc. Then the integration
limits for the high-Q regime do not depend on the energy of the excited state,
and the order of summation and integration may be interchanged in the
expressions for these integrated quantities. Thus, we are led to consideration
of the Bethe sum [12],

where I have followed Bethe in neglecting the small correlation terms involv-
ing two diﬀerent electrons.

For the low-Q region, the integration must be done ﬁrst. To accomplish
this, a long-wavelength approximation is introduced by expanding the expo-
nential in Fn(~q) as ei~q·~rj
(Q/mc2) gives

This leads to the TRK sum rule, which for a system of Z electrons is

For a relativistic projectile, the transverse part of the DCS must also be
included. The appearance of Eni in the denominator of this term complicates
its treatment in terms of sum rules. I have recently shown how to treat the

For the low-Q case, expansion of the denominator is not appropriate,
Eni and Q may be comparable in magnitude. When the target
since Q
system is non-relativistic, Fano showed that the transverse contribution is
proportional to S1 for small Q. In the case of a relativistic target, I have also
shown [13] that Fano’s approach must be generalized, as will be discussed in
Section 4.2.

2.2 Photon interactions

The study of sum rules for photon-matter interactions grew out of a conjec-
ture by Gell-Mann, Goldberger, and Thirring (GGT) [14]. In the course of
investigating the implications of causality on quantum theory and, in partic-
ular, on scattering amplitudes derived from ﬁeld theory, these authors arrived
at a dispersion relation between the dispersive and absorptive parts of the
photon forward scattering amplitude. Let us now look at how this leads to
sums that are quite similar to those discussed in the previous section.

In their paper, GGT considered the matrix element of the S matrix,
iR, for scattering of a photon of four-momentum k′′ and polarization
S = 1
σ into one of four-momentum k′ and polarization λ, by a matter system
which is ultimately left with its energy unchanged. They wrote,

are operators in the interaction representation. The operator a†
(a~ks) creates

(annihilates) a photon with momentum ¯h~k, frequency ω = kc, and polariza-
tion ~ǫs perpendicular to ~k.

Since the initial and ﬁnal states each have a single photon present and V
creates or annihilates one photon, it is clear that in Eq. (16), there are two
possible ways for the system to pass from the initial to the ﬁnal state. Either
a photon is ﬁrst emitted and then one is later absorbed, or vice-versa. This
yields two separate terms in Eq. (16), from which the scattering amplitude
becomes [14]

with H.c. the hermitian conjugate. The ﬁrst term in parentheses is the dipole
term E1, the next is the quadrupole E2, and the remaining terms represent
retardation eﬀects on the dipole interaction, denoted as E1ret.

In the dipole approximation only the ﬁrst term is kept, and using the
identity px = im[H, x]/¯h, we see that the GGT sum rule, Eq. (22), becomes

which is just the dipole oscillator strength sum rule of TRK, as claimed. The
important point is that Eq. (22) is much more general in that it has been
derived without the assumptions of long wavelengths, a dipole interaction,
and a non-relativistic matter system. Unfortunately, as we will discuss in the
following section, the conjecture Eq. (21) is incorrect and so therefore is the
GGT sum rule.

10

3 Review of early work

The conjecture of GGT was based on the notion that for very high energy
photons, one might reasonably suppose that the binding energy of the elec-
tron will have little import, and can therefore be neglected. Nonetheless,
GGT expressed concern about the correctness of this conjecture. In partic-
ular, they pointed out that the photoelectric cross section was then believed
to have a 1/ω dependence at high frequencies, leading to a logarithmic ω-
dependence on the right-hand side of Eq. (20).

R

The apparent divergence of

ef (ω) at large ω can be circumvented by in-
troducing a procedure that was originally suggested by Brown [15]. This pro-
cedure involves deﬁning the relevant cross section as the diﬀerence between
the photoelectric cross section and σpps, the cross section for pair production
in which the electron of the pair is produced in the occupied 1s state. As was
later discussed in detail by Erber [16], this deﬁnition of the cross section cor-
responds to scattering by the bound electron, alone. That is, it is in fact the
diﬀerence between the cross section for a one-electron atom and that for an
isolated proton [16]. Erber than argues that the logarithmic dependence of
the dispersive amplitude that was mentioned above is exactly canceled by this
subtraction procedure. It should be noted that along with this subtraction of
cross sections, one must include a corresponding subtraction of forward scat-
tering amplitudes, which has also been carefully discussed by Erber [16]. As
is shown in his Eq. (3.1), the correct amplitude is not then obtained directly
from the scattering amplitude of GGT, our Eq. (19). Rather, by carefully
considering the various processes involved in scattering from the atom and
also from the free proton, and in particular, the processes involving creation
and annihilation of electron-positron pairs, Erber has argued that the correct
iǫ in the second term of our
amplitude requires the replacement of iǫ by
Eq. (19) (compare Erber’s Eq. (3.1)).

−

Shortly after publication of the paper by GGT, Levinger and co-workers,
using the Brown/Erber procedure, showed that the conjecture, Eq. (21),
still turns out to be incorrect [4, 17, 18]. These authors began [17, 18] with
numerical studies of the dipole oscillator strengths for a single electron in the
ﬁeld of a P b nucleus undergoing transitions from the 1s into higher discrete
states. They found that the retarded, relativistic oscillator strengths for these
discrete transitions were only about 80% of their non-relativistic values [17].
For transitions to the continuum states, they obtained values from the work
Including Jacobsohn’s non-relativistic
of Brown [19, 20] and Hulme [21].

11

calculations of the electric quadrupole transitions (E2) [22], they found a
summed oscillator strength of approximately 0.86, in stark contrast to the
value of unity predicted by GGT (inclusion of retardation in E2 changes this
value to 0.87 [4]). They argued that this result should be accurate to within
a few percent, even considering the neglect of higher multipoles.

The following year, Levinger, Rustgi, and Okamoto addressed this ques-
tion through the evaluation of sum rules [4]. To overcome the diﬃculties
arising from the existence of negative energy states, these authors used
a semi-relativistic Hamiltonian, which does not have the negative energy
eigenstates of the original Dirac Hamiltonian. The important diﬀerence be-
tween their Hamiltonian and HS is the inclusion of the mass-variation term,
p4/8m3c2 (other correction terms in their Hamiltonian are at most
Hm =
linear in the momentum operator, and therefore do not contribute to the
sum rule). Since the negative energy states have already been removed, the
Brown/Erber subtraction procedure discussed above is not appropriate here
(nor is it needed in the related sum rule calculations discussed below), since
that procedure is speciﬁcally related to pair production, which is not included
in this approach.

for the GGT sum rule. They pointed out that the presence of T0 in the
denominator represents the increase of mass due to the electron’s kinetic en-
ergy, consistent with the fact that its presence results directly from inclusion
of Hm in the Hamiltonian. To obtain a numerical result, they used the value,
T0/mc2 = Z 2α2/2 = 0.18 for P b, with α the ﬁne structure constant. This
yields a summed oscillator strength of 0.82, in satisfactory agreement with
their earlier result of 0.87 [18]. They observed that exact agreement should
not be expected, due to the approximate nature of their numerical calcula-
(Z 4α4) in the sum rule
tions [17, 18], as well as the neglect of contributions
calculations.

The above result was conﬁrmed a decade later by Goldberger and Low

which is in agreement with Eq. (30) to lowest order. An exact expression for

Over the next several years, a number of papers considered the integrated
photoabsorption cross section [26, 27, 28, 29, 30], using analytical methods
based on closure and generalizing the sum rules by: (a) including a world-
scalar potential and utilizing the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation (FWT)
[31] to obtain a semi-relativistic Hamiltonian [27], and (b) studying a many-
electron system with interactions [28]. In spite of Levinger’s work [4, 17, 18],
Gerasimov concluded that the GGT sum rule, Eq. (22), was in fact correct
[29]. By studying speciﬁc models, Matsuura [28] obtained results in agree-
ment with Levinger’s [4], and pointed out that Gerasimov had incorrectly
assumed that f (ω) is analytic everywhere except on the real ω axis, invali-
dating his conclusions.

In 1985, Schmitt and Arenh¨ovel [32] studied the GGT sum, using both
analytical and numerical techniques. For the analytical eﬀorts, they studied
the leading relativistic corrections to the sum rule in three diﬀerent models
of the target particle: (a) non-relativistic (NR) or Schr¨odinger, (b) Foldy-
Wouthuysen (FW) using the FWT [31] to obtain a semi-relativistic model,

13

and (c) Dirac using HD and introducing projection operators to exclude
contributions from the negative energy states. In the latter case, they used
an expansion of the projection operators in powers of HD/mc2, so those
results are also semi-relativistic. Their use of the FWT to transform the
multipole operators for the FW model represented a technical improvement
over previous eﬀorts [4, 27], wherein only the Hamiltonian and states had
been transformed. Nonetheless, all their results were in agreement with that
of the earlier work.

∞

These authors also numerically calculated f (

), using the exact (fully
relativistic) expression of Goldberger and Low (see Eq. (4.1) of [25]) for a
particle in a square well. Their results were such that f (
) and the FW
calculation of the GGT sum diﬀered by an insigniﬁcant amount (less than
0.1%). The implications of this result for our understanding of relativistic ef-
fects is not completely clear, however, since their chosen binding energies are
rather small, being at most about 5% of the particle’s rest energy. Nonethe-
less, they did ﬁnd a small, but signiﬁcant, contribution to the GGT sum from
the pair production term, σpps.

∞

Shortly thereafter, Leung, Rustgi, and Long [33] considered relativistic
corrections to the Bethe sum rule. In a non-relativistic theory, this sum can
be readily evaluated exactly including all multipoles:

where I have again assumed an isotropic initial state. To obtain the rela-

corrections to the Bethe stopping power. Note that this result is obtained by
transforming the Hamiltonian and states, alone, while leaving the operator
ei~q·~r/¯h unchanged. Thus, this procedure is inconsistent in its treatment of the
various operators. We can also see that the result is incorrect by comparing
to that for a relativistic free-particle at rest [5],

The result of Eq. (33) should reduce to this expression if the expectation value

later formulated [35], obtaining

It was suggested in [33] that use of a no-pair Hamiltonian [36] and/or
ﬁeld-theoretic techniques might be useful for consideration of many-electron
atoms. Such techniques were later used by Aucar, Oddershede, and Sabin
[37] in their work on the relativistic corrections to the Bethe sum. They in-
troduced a second-quantized no-pair Hamiltonian and projected the operator
ei~q·~rj/¯h onto the space of positive energy states, thereby excluding transitions
into the negative energy states. These authors mention that it is straightfor-
ward to use their approach for the case of a many-electron atom, but they
explicitly consider only the one-electron case. Unfortunately, although the
techniques used in this approach are formidable, it does not appear to the
present author that there is any simple way to obtain detailed results from
their expressions, which are still in the form of a sum over a complete set of
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

4 Recent advances

4.1 Relativistic Bethe sum rule

In this section, I describe the work I have recently done on the relativistic
Bethe sum rule. I will discuss the FWT [31], derive a formally exact expres-
sion for the sum rule, and then explain why the results of [33, 35] are only
valid when q is small. I will also show how to obtain an exact treatment of
the q-dependence of the Bethe sum rule, using an FWT-type transformation
introduced by Douglas and Kroll [38]. When combined with the evaluation
of sum rules for the transverse part of the DCS, these results permit the

15

calculation of relativistic corrections to the stopping power that are valid
for a fully relativistic projectile [13]. At the end of this section, I outline a
method that appears to give highly accurate expressions for the TRK and
Bethe sums even for very strongly bound systems.

To implement the FWT, one inserts the identity operator in the form
of e−iU eiU , with U chosen to be Hermitian so that eiU is unitary. For this
preliminary discussion, I will assume that U is the exact FWT operator for
a general many-electron Hamiltonian H. Then, for example,

Thus, eiU induces a canonical transformation of the states and operators,
H = eiU He−iU . Then, deﬁning

The FWT operator, eiU , is chosen so as to bring the Hamiltonian into a
“block diagonal” form, explicitly separating the positive and negative energy
subspaces. Now these positive energy states are still 4-component spinors,
but their third and fourth components vanish. Therefore, though eiU (~q)e−iU
is a 4

elements in our sum. Deﬁning this block to be Rj, we then have,

To this point, I have assumed that U is the exact FWT operator. How-
ever, given that this operator is not known for the case of bound electrons, it
will eventually be necessary to introduce approximations for eiU . Nonethe-
less, the fact that Eq. (40) is an exact result for the sum rule implies that
the excited states have been treated exactly, and an approximate treatment
of the operators appearing in the resultant expectation value does not alter
this conclusion.
In particular, this expression remains valid even when a
semi-relativistic approximation to the FWT is used under circumstances for
which the original summation includes signiﬁcant contributions from highly
relativistic states

, such as with very large values of Q.
Let us now see why the approximations used in [33, 35] for a single electron
yield results that are only valid when q is small. These authors used the
approximation of [31],

(41)

which involves an expansion in powers of the small quantities p/mc and
(1/mN ). The calculation of the FW Hamiltonian [31]
V /mc2, with UN ∼ O
then proceeds by an expansion in powers of the UN . For example, the ﬁrst
step of the FWT gives

· · ·
which is an expansion in powers of p/mc, since U1 =
~p/2mc. Higher
order corrections to the Hamiltonian are obtained from U2 and U3 in a simi-
lar fashion [31]. Now, H1(~q) is obtained from H1 by the replacement of ~p by
~p + ~q. This means that the above expansion in powers of p/mc leads directly
to an expansion in powers of q/mc. Since this approach has started out with
a p-expansion, it ends up with a q-expansion and is therefore incapable of
handling large values of q. Therefore, unlike the NR Bethe sum rule, the
relativistic corrections of [33, 35] do not include contributions from all mul-
tipoles. In fact, the diﬀerence between the free and bound particle results,
given in Eqs. (34) and (35), arises only from the dipole contributions. There-
fore, the latter equation gives us little more information than the corrections
to the TRK sum rule.

An expansion in powers of the potential energy V does not lead to the
diﬃculty described in the previous paragraph, at least as long as V commutes
with ei~q·~r/¯h so that e−i~q·~r/¯hV ei~q·~r/¯h = V . This indicates that the way to

17

circumvent the restriction to low q is to avoid, or at least delay, the expansion
in powers of p. Douglas and Kroll [38], have introduced a modiﬁed FWT that
only expands in powers of V [38, 39, 40] and is therefore suitable for this
purpose. This transformation (DKT), which is still of the form of Eq. (41),
takes U1 = Uf for a many-electron system, where

Nevertheless, the contributions to the sum rule from Vkl (apart from its

and the potential energy of the electrons does not appear explicitly in the re-
sult, entering only through its eﬀects on the ground-state wavefunction of the
(p4/m4c4)
target system. These results give the relativistic corrections to
(p2V /m3c4). Since they are valid to all orders in Q/mc2, they include
and
contributions from all multipoles, unlike earlier studies [33, 35]. It should
also be remembered that the Bethe sum arises from the longitudinal part
of the DCS and as such, does not involve retardation, in contrast to the
photoabsorption sum of GGT.

The ﬁrst term is just that found by numerous others [4, 26, 28, 27, 32], but
the second term had not previously been known. The reader may recall
that the TRK sum rule for a single electron in the ﬁeld of a P b nucleus
was evaluated (along with electric quadrupole and retardation contributions)
It is consistent with these methods to
using perturbative methods in [4].
evaluate the p4 term using an NR wavefunction. For the one-electron case
and a P b nucleus, this gives a contribution of
0.53, whereas
the ﬁrst-order term is 0.30. Thus, it is quite clear that this approach fails
badly for such strongly bound systems. For neutral atoms, on the other hand,
we may expect that the average over electrons will diminish the errors and
allow the perturbative approach to give a reasonably close approximation.
This notion is supported by the results I obtained in [41]. Nonetheless, it
needs to be checked with the more accurate approach described below, using
DKT wavefunctions.

35(Zα)4/8

≈ −

−

Numerical studies of Eqs. (51) and (54) indicate that perturbative calcu-
lations of these sum rules for neutral atomic systems yield accurate results
over a wide range of Z [41]. Further work is needed, however, when Z > 70
and Q is small, if one wishes to achieve an accuracy of 0.5% or better [41].

20

To obtain this greater accuracy for high Z, it is possible to use the methods
already described, but to forego completely the expansion in powers of pj.
That is, we may insert Eqs. (44), (46), (47), and (49), directly into Eq. (40),
and evaluate the expectation value using the accurate DKT ground state of
H. Expectation values using these states, and carefully including the eﬀects
of Vkl, have been used extensively by Hess and co-workers [39, 45, 46]. The
f
success these authors have had with such calculations, keeping only low-order
terms in V , makes it quite likely that this approach will also yield highly ac-
curate results for the sum rules.

O

For the

(V ) terms calculated without the p-expansion, numerical eval-
uation of the Bethe sum for nonzero Q appears to oﬀer quite a signiﬁcant
challenge [47]. Therefore, I have begun with consideration of the TRK sum,
S1 = Z(1
(V ) in ∆V . Now, ∆f has the relatively

but the expression for ∆V is quite complicated, so will not be written out
(cid:12)
here. Though accurate numerical calculations of ∆f and ∆V are yet to be
completed, I have obtained order-of-magnitude estimates of these quantities
for a single-electron system by using NR hydrogenic wavefunctions. The
results are intriguing, and they will be the basis of the discussion in the
remainder of this section, which will mainly be speculative in nature pending
the outcome of work in progress.

e

For all values of Z, these rough estimates indicate that ∆V is much smaller
than ∆f . Considering once again a single electron in the ﬁeld of a P b nucleus,
I ﬁnd ∆f = 0.17, while ∆V = 0.002 .
If instead we have a nucleus with
Z = 120, then ∆f = 0.27 and ∆V = 0.008. We see that even for such extreme
0.03, and ∆V itself is only about 1% of the total sum.
conditions, ∆V /∆f ≈
For most physical systems, only a small fraction of the electrons will have
binding energies approaching those just considered. For neutral atoms, I
have found ∆f to be no more than about 0.03 in the perturbative approach
[13, 41]. If the relative size of the two terms remains even approximately the
same, than we will be justiﬁed in neglecting ∆V . If this is conﬁrmed by the
more accurate numerical methods using many-electron DKT wavefunctions,
then Eq. (55) will give us the eﬀectively exact relativistic corrections, Erel
1 ,
to the TRK sum rule. Since this expression does not involve the potential

21

energy V and is rather simple in form, it should be relatively easy to evaluate
even with realistic wavefunctions.

We may hope for more. In studies of the Bethe sum, it was found that
the relativistic corrections were never much larger than their value at Q = 0
[41]. Therefore, given the relationship between the TRK sum and the Q
0
limit of the Bethe sum (see Eq. (14)), it seems probable that ∆V (Q) will be
negligible over the whole range of Q. If this can be demonstrated, then the
corrections to the Bethe sum rule will be given to high accuracy by setting
V = 0 in the operators appearing in the expectation value of Eq. (40). This
reduces to the simple expression [13, 35],

4.2 Photoabsorption sum rules for scattering of charged

particles

In this section, I will discuss the summations that arise from considerations
of the transverse part of the DCS, given in Eq. (7), and show they are closely
related to the GGT sum. In [13], I have evaluated sum rules for these contri-
butions to the stopping power using both low- and high-Q approximations.
In the high-Q region, the recoil energy and energy transfer cannot diﬀer sig-
niﬁcantly [1, 5], so it is a good approximation to make an expansion in powers
of (Q
Eni)/Q, which leads to sums of the form given in Eq. (15). Although
these sums involve the Dirac operators ~αj, they can be handled with the same
techniques described in the previous section for treatment of the longitudinal
contributions. Details of this approach, along with corresponding results for
the stopping power, are given in [13].

related the matrix element of αx to that of x, reducing this expression to one
proportional to the dipole oscillator strength, fn [5].

In obtaining the relativistic corrections to the stopping power, I found it
(q2) from the exponential in Eq. (59) in order that
necessary to keep terms
the results for the stopping power were independent of the choice of cutoﬀ,
Qc [13]. Rewriting q in terms of Eni and expanding the exponential allows
the ψ-integral to be done, and yields an expression for Bt involving the two

i¯hcαjx (apart from small two-body terms), Eq. (60) is just the
[H, xj] =
relativistic TRK sum, representing the unretarded dipole contributions E1.
Comparison to Eq. (25) reveals that Eq. (61) is just the relativistic form of
the combination, E2 + E1ret, considered in the work on photoabsorption sum
rules. It is thus seen to have been no accident that for a relativistic treatment
of the target, I needed to keep higher-order terms in the expansion of the
exponential of Eq. (59). As has been pointed out previously, the eﬀects of

higher multipoles, retardation, and relativity all lead to contributions of the
same order of magnitude. Keeping only the leading term in the expansion
excludes the E2 and E1ret contributions, and cannot yield a consistent rela-
tivistic formulation. We also see here a direct relationship between the GGT
sum, which arose out of studies of photoabsorption, and the sums related to
the transverse contributions to the stopping power.

Though we have arrived at this conclusion from consideration of the low-
est order multipoles, it can be shown that this relationship holds for all
multipoles. If the lower limit of the integral in Eq. (59) is avoided, then we
may directly extract from Eq. (59) the sum,

~α) of the integrated pho-
which is just the relativistic generalization (~p
toabsorption cross-section in Eq. (24). Thus, the sums for the transverse
contributions to the stopping power have contributions that are exactly the
same as those appearing in the photoabsorption dispersion relation of GGT.
We may understand the appearance of the photoabsorption sum in the
context of charged particle scattering in the following way: First, note that
this contribution to the stopping power represents the exchange of transverse
photons between projectile and target. If the target is initially in its ground
state, it cannot emit, and can only absorb. Then, observe that in Eq. (59),
the projectile states have already been integrated out, leaving a description in
terms of the target states alone. Thus, this equation describes the absorption
of photons by the target, and it is completely reasonable that it contains the
photoabsorption sum.

Nonetheless, the reader may note two important diﬀerences between Eqs.
(24) and (59) . First, for the charged particle case, the energy-momentum
relation given after Eq. (58) is not that usually seen for photons. This is be-
cause these are virtual photons, for which energy and momentum can take on
any value, and each may do so independently of the other. One may imagine
that both projectile and target are constantly emitting and reabsorbing vir-
tual photons, and occasionally one of these photons gets exchanged between
the two. The photons that are exchanged must be ones that lead to con-
servation of both energy and momentum in the overall interaction between
projectile and target, since that is a real process. This requirement leads
to the relation, q = Eni/v cos ψ (except at extremely high incident energies,

24

approaching the T eV range for protons) instead of Eni/c.

The second diﬀerence has to do with the presence of the ψ-integration in
Eq. (59). This integral simply reﬂects the fact that contributions from all
possible ﬁnal states of the projectile have already been summed. Therefore,
unlike in the photoabsorption case where there is only one possible momen-
tum transfer for each Eni, here there is a range of momentum transfer, or
equivalently ψ, that is possible. One may also note that the upper limit,
cos2 ψc, of the ψ-integral depends on Eni. Therefore, there are additional
terms that diﬀer in form from those resembling the photoabsorption sum.

5 The trouble with relativity

We have seen that signiﬁcant challenges arise in the evaluation of sum rules
for relativistic systems. Unlike their non-relativistic counterparts, the use
of closure for relativistic sum rules requires the introduction of special tech-
niques, such as the FWT or projection operators [32], to exclude contri-
butions from negative energy states. Direct use of closure without such
techniques in a single-particle theory of a hydrogenic system includes con-
tributions from transitions of the electron into negative energy states. As
previously stated, these contributions precisely cancel those from transitions
into positive energy states [4], yielding unphysical vanishing results for the
sum rules.

If one views these sums from the many-electron perspective of Dirac’s
hole theory, on the other hand, the negative energy states are ﬁlled (Dirac
sea) and transitions into these states are automatically excluded. Then one
might expect an absence of such diﬃculties when using the closure relation,
now a many-electron state including the ﬁlled Dirac
sea. However, one still obtains a vanishing result when an average over the
P
direction of ~q is taken (the mathematics is essentially the same as for single-
electron theory). The explanation of this result is no longer straightforward,
but as I will now describe, it is related to the appearance of inﬁnities from
the participation of electrons in the Dirac sea. For the following discussion
let us consider the Bethe sum,

electron at rest in the presence of the Dirac sea. Then with
given
by suitably symmetrized sets of momentum states, the matrix elements for a
~q), and only one ﬁnal state contributes
given ~q are proportional to δ(~pj
to the sum over states for each j. For bound electrons, this probability
distribution will be broadened, as has been discussed in reference to the
Bethe surface [1, 5, 48], but the basic arguments presented below still hold.
Therefore, the conclusions should be quite general.

In consideration of this system, we may identify two possible sources of
inﬁnity. The ﬁrst is the inﬁnite energy, ED, of the Dirac sea contained in
each of En and Ei. The other is the fact that
j runs over an inﬁnite number
of electrons. Let us consider each of these in turn.
P
For a given j, we have a sum over states

n
and a subtraction of the

Ei. If the subtraction is taken ﬁrst, explicitly calcu-
energies, Eni = En −
lating each individual term prior to the summation over states, there is a
precise cancelation of the inﬁnite ED between En and Ei. Then a ﬁnite re-
sult is obtained, which is proportional to q2 for small q (this calculation is
straightforward for the free-particle states presently under consideration).

On the other hand, when the sum over states is done ﬁrst using closure,

we obtain a very diﬀerent result,

S1(Q) =

For each j, the result is again ﬁnite, but here it is linear in ~q and therefore,
upon averaging over the direction of ~q, we obtain the vanishing result referred
to above. What has happened is that we have reformulated the sum into a
diﬀerence of two terms,

each of which is inﬁnite. While the inﬁnities still cancel, the resulting ﬁnite
result is of a very diﬀerent form as that found by explicit calculation of
each individual term, followed by the summation. Because of the presence
of inﬁnities, it is incorrect to interchange the order of these mathematical
operations, the subtraction and summation being considered here.

26

One may ask, which method is the correct one? We will argue that it
is the ﬁrst one, where the subtraction is taken before the summation, even
though, as we shall see, this yields an inﬁnite result.

To begin with, I remind the reader that the Bethe sum arose in a cal-
culation of the mean energy loss from fast charged particles to matter. The
deﬁnition of this sum thus involves terms, each of which has a factor of the
energy transfer, Eni. Each term to be summed is proportional to this energy
diﬀerence; that is, according to the original derivation of the sum, the diﬀer-
ence should be taken before the summation over states. As further evidence,
note that our result should reduce to the NR result in the appropriate limit.
The NR result is also proportional to q2 and does not vanish upon averaging
over the direction of ~q. Therefore, we conclude that the correct result is that
obtained when the summation over states comes after the subtraction of en-
ergies. The alternative, where closure is used directly to obtain a sum rule,
is seen to be faulty, as a result of the interchange of mathematical operations
in the presence of inﬁnities.

Next let us consider the sum over electrons. As I have said, for any
given free electron only a single transition contributes to the sum, that for
′ = ~pj + ~q. For a positive energy electron initially at rest, the en-
which ~pj
ergy diﬀerence between these states is just Q
QM . Transitions involving
energies greater than QM cannot occur. In this sense, though energy conser-
vation has been discarded by including all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in
the summation, it has been eﬀectively reinstated by the upper limit of the
Q-integration.

≤

Ei|
|
Ei| → ∞
|

With the Dirac sea of electrons, we are not so lucky. For each negative
energy state of momentum ~pj, there is a corresponding positive energy state
of momentum ~pj +~q, and the energy diﬀerence between these states can be as
or larger. Since summation over the entire Dirac sea includes
large as 2
the limit
, transitions involving the production of arbitrarily high
energy electron-positron pairs make signiﬁcant contributions to the sum. Al-
though the corresponding matrix elements decrease with increasing
, they
do not decrease fast enough to keep the sum over electrons from diverging.
An explicit calculation, readily done for the free-electron model, shows that
the resulting sum is inﬁnite.

Ei|

Though these arguments have speciﬁcally considered a free-electron model,
the basic ideas hold for bound electrons, as well. The transition probability
will in this case be broadened by the binding energy, but pairs of arbitrarily
high energy will still be produced for any given recoil energy Q. Therefore,

27

the conclusions of the previous paragraphs should be valid generally. The
same conclusions also apply to the TRK sum, since it may be obtained di-
rectly from the Bethe sum, as shown in Eq. (14). In the photoabsorption
sum of GGT the momentum transfer is ﬁxed by the relationship, q = Eni/c.
While this diﬀers from that in the free-electron model for charged particle
scattering, the above arguments do not depend on the precise relationship
between these quantities. Therefore, the arguments are applicable to all sum
rules considered in this article.

I wish to stress that it is completely “reasonable” that the result is inﬁ-
nite. The use of closure has removed any limits on the energy transfer, and
the model no longer obeys conservation of energy, at least not with respect
to the ﬁnite energy of any realistic physical system. This point is of some
interest, since it seems to imply that the presence of inﬁnities is an unavoid-
able consequence of the use of closure along with inclusion of pair production
processes in these sums. The sums include contributions from creation of ar-
bitrarily high energy electron-positron pairs. Furthermore, these are real, as
opposed to virtual, pairs. It is not, for example, a matter of an electron being
surrounded by a sea of virtual pairs, leading to polarization of the vacuum
and altering observable quantities, such as the electron’s charge and mass.
Rather, these are real pairs being produced by collision with a projectile,
which in this treatment is eﬀectively being considered to have inﬁnite en-
ergy. Since there is inﬁnite energy available, real pairs of unlimited energy
can be produced, and the inﬁnite result for the mean energy transfer is in
this sense quite reasonable. Though one might have hoped that an approach
utilizing the full power of quantum electrodynamics, including the removal of
inﬁnities by the methods of renormalization, would allow the eﬀects of pair
production to be incorporated along with the usual excitation of positive en-
ergy electrons, these observations seem to indicate that any such eﬀorts will
prove unsuccessful if they also utilize closure to obtain sum rules. It appears
that calculations of the pair production contributions to these sums will re-
quire an approach with explicit limits on the amount of energy exchanged
between projectile and target.

6 Conclusion

In this article, I have discussed relativistic eﬀects on sum rules appearing in
the description of scattering of charged particles and photons from atoms.

28

Having begun with considerations of how sum rules arise in these contexts,
I then reviewed the early work on this challenging subject. Following this, I
discussed my own recent contributions utilizing the Foldy-Wouthuysen and
Douglas-Kroll transformations, and conjectured the latter has the capability
of producing relatively simple expressions that give highly accurate results
for these sums for even the heaviest of elements.
I also demonstrated the
equivalence of sums for the transverse interaction in the charged particle
case and those which describe photoabsorption. Finally, I have discussed the
diﬃculties that arise in evaluating these sum rules from the perspective of
Dirac’s hole theory, and shown that the understanding of these diﬃculties is
much less straightforward then when considered from a single-particle point
of view. In hole theory, the diﬃculties were traced to inﬁnities that arise due
to the presence of the ﬁlled Dirac sea. These considerations suggest that it
will not be possible to obtain physically reasonable sum rules using closure
if pair production processes are also included in the treatment.

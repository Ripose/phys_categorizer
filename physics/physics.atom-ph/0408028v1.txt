We demonstrate the production of micron-sized high density atom clouds of interest for meso-
scopic quantum information processing. We evaporate atoms from 60 µK, 3 × 1014 atoms/cm3
samples contained in a highly anisotropic optical lattice formed by interfering diﬀracted beams from
a holographic phase plate. After evaporating to 1 µK by lowering the conﬁning potential, in less
than a second the atom density reduces to 8×1013 cm−3 at a phase space density approaching unity.
−3.
Adiabatic recompression of the atoms then increases the density to levels in excess of 1 × 1015 cm
The resulting clouds are typically 8 µm in the longest dimension. Such samples are small enough
to enable mesoscopic quantum manipulation using Rydberg blockade and have the high densities
required to investigate new collision phenomena.

Two of the most important themes in current studies
of ultracold incoherent matter are studies of plasmas and
Rydberg atoms at low temperature and high density, and
use of mesoscopic samples for topics in quantum informa-
tion processing. Even at the relatively modest 1012 cm−3
densities of standard magneto-optical traps, a wide va-
riety of new phenomena have been observed by exciting
atoms near the ionization limit[1]. Similarly, the use of
atomic ensembles with their collectively enhanced light-
atom interactions have led to new developments such as
collective spin squeezing [2], quantum memory [3], and
single-photon generation[4]. With these contexts in mind
we report in this Letter new techniques for producing
high density (> 1015 cm−3) mesoscopic (5-10 µm) sam-
ples ideal for use in both types of experiments.

In the context of high densities, we note that the recent
predictions of novel ultralong range Rydberg molecular
states [5, 6, 7] require extremely high densities to attain
signiﬁcant production rates. These “trilobite” molecules
arise from the Fermi point-like interactions between Ry-
dberg and ground-state atoms. At the densities reported
here, the Fermi shifts of the Rydberg levels are on the or-
der of 100 MHz. Similarly, the production of cold plasmas
and Rydberg gases at these densities promises to reveal
new phenomena not accesible in conventional laser traps
which have 100-1000 times lower densities.

Regarding mesoscopic atom samples, Lukin et al.
[8]
recently proposed manipulating quantum information us-
ing the very long range dipole-dipole interactions pro-
duced by Rydberg atoms. In brief, the excitation of a
single Rydberg atom strongly suppresses the excitation
of other atoms within its range of inﬂuence. If the size of
a sample of atoms is less than the blockade range R, then
the accessible quantum states of the ensemble are limited
to states of zero or one atom excitations. Using Rydberg
states as intermediate states in Rabi manipulation of two
hyperﬁne ground states then allows the production of
stable but highly entangled collective excitations of the
ensembles. For MHz rate quantum manipulations with
cw lasers the value of R required is a few µm at principal

quantum numbers n > 50 [9]. The clouds produced in
this experiment reach this length scale.

Recent experiments have demonstrated dramatic sup-
pression of pulsed Rydberg state excitation in magneto-
optical traps of size L ≫ R [10, 11]. In these experiments,
the number of excited Rydberg atoms saturates at ﬂu-
ence values much less than expected for isolated atoms
due to the Rydberg-Rydberg interactions shifting atoms
out of resonance with the exciting lasers.
If the Ryd-
berg blockade is eﬀective, the number of excited atoms
should be limited to roughly (L/R)3. If the blockade is
not complete, saturation still occurs but with a greater
number of excited atoms. Thus to diﬀerentiate block-
ade and suppression requires production of mesoscopic
samples of size L ∼ R [12].

In this Letter we present a method for producing high
density elliptical mesoscopic atom samples with semi-
major axes σ on the order of R using rapid evaporative
cooling of 87Rb atoms from a Holographic Atom Trap
(HAT), followed by adiabatic recompression. We demon-
strate densities in excess of 1015 cm−3, the highest cold
atom densities attained for incoherent matter. The re-
compression stage can produce clouds of radius as small
as 5.6 µm, suﬃciently small to be sensitive to single atom
Rydberg blockade.

The HAT, described in detail elsewhere [13], is a lattice
of interference fringes produced by imaging 5 diﬀracted
orders (zeroth order plus 4 equal intensity ﬁrst order
beams) from a holographic phase plate. The laser used
is an 18W cw ﬂashlamp-pumped Nd:YAG laser at 1.064
µm, intensity stabilized and controlled using an acousto-
optic modulator feedback system. Along the propagation
axis the Talbot eﬀect gives rise to a series of interference
fringes. Each Talbot fringe contains a lattice with a unit
cell of 10 µm × 10 µm × 100 µm as illustrated in Figure 1.
The ﬁve diﬀracted orders are focussed to approximately
90 µm waists at the region of intersection, giving a typ-
ical full-intensity trap depth of U0 = 600 µK, and trap
oscillation frequencies of 18.4 ± 1.2 kHz, 18.4 ± 1.2 kHz,
and 735 ± 62 kHz. Atoms are loaded into the HAT from

2

evaporation, the density n scales as the atom number N ;
the phase space density ρ scales as N ν3/T 3 ∝ n/U 3/2.
Even though the density and the collision rates decrease
with time, they are suﬃciently high in the HAT that
the limit on the evaporation speed is the required adia-
baticity of the z-motion and the desire not to remove too
many atoms. An interesting feature of the HAT is the
inequivalence of the various trapping sites: sites towards
the edge of the trap are more weakly bound than those at
the center. As the evaporation proceeds atom loss from
the outer sites is greater, causing the fraction of atoms
contained in the central microtrap to increase from ini-
tially 6% to nearly 15%. Atom densities and phase space
densities as a function of time are shown in Figure 2.

a forced-dark-spot F = 1 magneto-optical trap [14].

We use absorption imaging to characterize the spa-
tial distribution of the atoms in the HAT, to make ab-
solute measurements of the number of atoms, and to
measure the atomic temperature via time-of-ﬂight tech-
niques. The HAT is ﬁrst turned oﬀ in 10 µs in order
to eliminate AC Stark shifts and excited state hyperﬁne
mixing. Then a 150 µs pulse of light from a diode laser
tuned to the 5S1/2(F = 1) → 5P1/2(F ′ = 2) transition
passes through the atoms which are imaged onto a CCD
camera. The imaging lens system is a pair of commercial
achromats that give an aberration-limited resolution of
approximately 5 µm. Images are analyzed to deduce the
number and distribution of atoms contained in the diﬀer-
ent microtraps We make use of a calibrated absorption
method for absolute number measurements [15]. When
the ﬂuence of the imaging pulse is suﬃcient to remove
all the atoms from the F = 1 state, the average num-
ber of photons absorbed per atom is given simply from
the ﬂuorescence branching ratios to be 2. The number of
atoms is then directly determined from the camera quan-
tum eﬃciency and the transmission of the lenses. For
small numbers of atoms and for time-of-ﬂight tempera-
ture measurements, an additional laser tuned to repump
the atoms back to F = 1 can be used to artiﬁcially in-
crease the number of photons absorbed per atom.

FIG. 2: During forced evaporation the phase space density
ρ approaches unity while the density n decreases with atom
loss.

After evaporating to a ﬁnal temperature Te and den-
sity ne, typically 1 µK and 8 × 1013 cm−3, we recompress
the cloud by adiabatically returning the trap depth to
its maximum value U0. Since the trap depth increases
more rapidly than the temperature, this shuts oﬀ evap-
oration, holding the number of atoms constant in the
absence of loss mechanisms. The phase space density is
conserved for an adiabatic process, thus T ∝ ν ∝ U 1/2
and n ∝ N ν3/T 3/2. As a result, the recompressed den-
sity is nr = ne(U0/Ue)3/4. In our case, this gives a factor
of 20 density increase, consistent with our measured ﬁnal
density of 1.8 ± 0.5 × 1015/cm3.

A simple argument shows that the ﬁnal attainable den-
sity using this method depends not only on the phase
space density ρe achieved from evaporation, but the tem-
perature Te as well. The density ne after evaporation
3/2
is proportional to the product ρeT
. The compres-

sion factor is (U0/Ue)
for ﬁxed U0, hence

the highest density is achieved when evaporating to a
(see inset to

densities. Evaporating to lower trap depths takes in-

FIG. 1: Holographic Atom Trap: ﬁve laser beams diﬀracted
from a phase plate are imaged onto a MOT cloud. Atoms
collect in the intensity maxima of the interference pattern of
the beams.

After loading atoms into the HAT at densities of
3 × 1014 cm−3 and temperatures of 60 µK, the atoms are
distributed over typically ﬁve Talbot fringes, with each
Talbot fringe containing typically 25 occupied microtraps
of slightly diﬀering trap depths. Atoms in these mi-
crotraps have suﬃciently high collision rates (20,000/s)
to initiate forced evaporative cooling. Using established
protocols [16, 17], we gently reduce the HAT intensity, al-
lowing high kinetic energy atoms to escape while retain-
ing low energy atoms and thereby increasing phase space
density. The evaporation process tightly couples the trap
depth U and the temperature so that T ≈ U/10. During

crease the temperature with time. As a result, n(t) de-
creases due to both recombination losses and tempera-
ture increases. Taking these eﬀects into account, we ﬁnd
K = 3.5±1.9×10−29 cm6/s, in close agreement with pre-
vious measurements [19, 20]. We have measured the rate
in a magnetic ﬁeld of 2.5 Gauss typically present in mag-
netic traps. At this ﬁeld we measure K = 4.8±2.3×10−29
cm6/s. These results are extremely sensitive to density
errors; the agreement with previous experiments is con-
ﬁrmation of the reliability of the density measurements.

creasingly more time due to the adiabatic constraints.
Losses from heating mechanisms and background colli-
to slowly decrease. This eﬀectively
sions cause ρeT
determines the optimum value of Ue at which to start
the recompression. Even with this constraint on Ue it is
interesting to point out the wide range of densities at-
tainable with this method.

We show recompression data for various values of Ue
in Figure 3. Like evaporation, the limiting timescale for
recompression is adiabaticity. However, unlike evapora-
tion, the number of atoms is conserved so the potential
can be ramped up rapidly. Figure 3 shows that even at
the lowest values of Ue densities over 1015 cm−3 can be
achieved in less than 900 ms. The adiabatic constraints
on the Ue = 10 µK data in Figure 3 were purposely
lightened to limit losses due to background collisions and
heating mechanisms. The eﬀect is a small breakdown of
the scaling ratios which assume perfect adiabaticity.

FIG. 4: After recompression we observe rapid atom loss due
to 3-body recombination. Since there is no evaporation from
the recompressed clouds we can measure trap heating rates
by directly measuring dT/dt (inset).

We have also conﬁrmed the densities by measuring
cloud sizes. After evaporation and recompression, the
semi-minor axis of the cloud is only 430 nm, too small
to optically resolve. However, the z-axis size of 10.8 µm
at 13 µK is resolvable. The measured z-axis sizes agree
to within 0.5 microns with the value σ = p2T /mω2
expected from the frequency and temperature measure-
ments, once optical resolution and motion of the atoms
during the imaging pulse are taken into account.

In addition to using evaporation followed by recom-
pression to produce high densities,
it can be used to
produce strong conﬁnement of the atoms. During evap-
oration, the spatial dimensions σ of the atom clouds
are unchanged since both T and ω2 scale linearly with
trap depth. During recompression T ∝ ω so that σ ∝
(U0/Ub)1/4 yields up to a factor of 4 in size reduction for
trap depth ratios of 300 that we have produced in our
system. The smallest clouds we can directly observe are
inferred from this ratio and the measured trap depth of
2 µK to be σ = 5.6 µm. The smallest clouds for which
we have a direct temperature measurement have σ = 8
µm.

We now evaluate these results in the context of Ry-

FIG. 3: Compression data and model (solid line) for 3 values
of Ue. The inset shows how the key parameter ρT 3/4 varies
with trap depth.

The high densities are deduced from measurements of
the number of atoms, the fraction of atoms in each mi-
crotrap, the temperature, and direct measurements of the
trap spring constants. The latter are obtained using the
parametric heating method [18]. We conﬁrm the inferred
densities using measurements of known 3-body recombi-
nation rates and by imaging the z-axis spatial distribu-
tion. The three-body recombination rates are determined
by measuring the number of atoms in the recompressed
central microtrap as a function of time after recompres-
sion: dN/dt = −K R n(t)3dV − ΓN , where K is the 3-
body recombination rate coeﬃcient and Γ the loss rate
due to background collisions. Data are shown in Fig-
ure 4. After recompression the temperature is too small
to allow evaporation. However, heating mechanisms in-

dberg blockade. We imagine excitation to ns Rydberg
states with a Gaussian beam of waist 10 µm. For non-
uniform excitation, the appropriate ﬁgure of merit is

the Rydberg-Rydberg level shift Ω deﬁned via 1/Ω
=

h|1/Ωij|
i averaged over all atom pairs ij. Using cal-
culated ns-ns potentials [9] with n = (70, 95), we ﬁnd
Ω = (2.0, 62) MHz for σ = 5.6 µm, and Ω = (0.7, 21)
MHz for σ = 8.0 µm. For a collective 2 µs π-pulse, the
probability of double excitation even in the worst case of
Ω = 0.7 MHz is 6%. Thus these clouds are extremely
well-suited to investigate high speed, high ﬁdelity collec-
tive coherent quantum manipulations.

For some applications, it may be useful to isolate a
single microtrap from the others. To do this, we exploit
the anisotropy of the microtraps to parametrically heat
the atoms in the outer microtraps with little disturbance
to the atoms contained in the central microtrap. The
quality factor for our parametric heating experiment is
about 10 for the x-direction, suﬃcient to give signiﬁcant
diﬀerentiation of the 3% diﬀerence in oscillation frequen-
cies between the center and outer microtraps. Thus we
drive the parametric resonance at its low frequency tail,
selectively heating and ejecting the atoms from the outer
microtraps while causing minor heating for the center mi-
crotrap. Doing this, we have been able to increase the
center well fraction from 15% to above 40%.

In addition to its utility for generating high densities
and small clouds, adiabatic recompression also allows di-
rect measurements of trap heating rates. Under condi-
tions of evaporation, heating mechanisms do not actu-
ally increase the temperature when evaporation is rapid
enough to recool the atoms by atom loss. Thus heating
and loss mechanisms can be diﬃcult to disentangle un-
der conditions of evaporation. However, evaporation no
longer functions after recompression, and heating rates
can be deduced directly from measured temperature in-
creases with time. Example data are shown in the inset
to Figure 4. The deduced heating rate dE/dt = 3dT /dt
is a factor of 1.4 larger than the predictions of Bali et
al. [21] for quantum diﬀractive heating. Indeed, taking
this measured heating rate into account in our evapora-
tion model, combined with the heating due to multiple
scattering as predicted by Beijerinck [22], we generate
the solid curve in Fig. 2 that accounts for our measured
phase space density as a function of time.

The experiments we have described represent a robust
method for producing the kinds of high density (> 1015
cm−3) and small size clouds (< 8 µm) of interest for Ry-
dberg atom studies both in the high density regime of ul-
tracold plasmas and molecular spectroscopy, and in the
small size regime relevant to coherent single-atom ma-

nipulation for quantum information processing. Many
other proposed applications, including deterministic sin-
gle atom and photon sources [23] and fast quantum state
detection and transmission schemes [24], require these
types of sources for their operation.

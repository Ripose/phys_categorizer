Abstract

The energies at geometries close to the equilibrium for the e+BeO and e+LiF ground states
were computed by means of diﬀusion Monte Carlo simulations. These results allow us to predict
the equilibrium geometries and the vibrational frequencies for these exotic systems, and to
discuss their stability with respect to the various dissociation channels. Since the adiabatic
positron aﬃnities were found to be smaller than the dissociation energies for both complexes,
we propose these two molecules as possible candidates in the challenge to produce and detect
stable positron-molecule systems.

Despite the wide diﬀusion of positron and positronium (Ps) based analytical techniques to study
solids [1], polymers [2], solutions [3], and organic molecules in the gas phase [4, 5], a direct ob-
servation of the compounds between the positron and an atom or a molecule is still lacking. In fact
Γ2γ annihilation rate from positron annihilation life-time spectroscopy and angular correlation anni-
hilation radiation are the only standard measurements carried out during the interaction positron-
matter. The prediction of these observables is required to infer the formation of the positronic
compounds, a task that appears complex, especially for heavy atoms and ions or large molecules,
due to the high accuracy that is needed for the wave function that describes the complexes.

The theoretical work on positron containing systems is scarce, and in our opinion this is due
to the diﬃculty in describing accurately the electron-positron correlation using standard quantum
chemistry methods like Self Consistent Field (SCF), Conﬁguration Interaction, and Coupled Cluster
methods [6].

Two more approaches have been pursued during the last years, namely Density Functional The-
ory (DFT) [7] and variational calculations based on Explicitly Correlated Gaussian (ECG) trial wave
functions [8, 9]: they also suﬀer from practical drawbacks. Although DFT methods have a conve-
nient scaling of the computational cost versus the system complexity, the exact exchange-correlation
potential between electrons and the correlation potential between electrons and positron are only
approximately known. As far as ECG wave functions are concerned, two groups [8, 9] showed that
accurate results can be obtained even for positron containing systems. Unfortunately, the ECG
wave functions suﬀer from the fast increase of the computational cost with the number of particles,
therefore preventing their use for medium and large systems. Nevertheless, accurate results can be
obtained employing the frozen-core approximation for atoms and molecules [8].

In our ongoing project to study positronic compounds as a way to understand matter-antimatter
interactions and to predict the existence of a bound state for positron-atom or positron-molecule
complexes [10-15], we employ the ﬁxed node diﬀusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) method [16]. This
technique is known to be able to recover most of the correlation energy between electrons and
between electrons and a positron [10-15,17-19]. Although FN-DMC is a powerful technique, it is
not easy to reduce the nodal error introduced by the ﬁxed node approximation. This result might
be achieved in principle by employing more accurate trial wave functions or resorting to the nodal
release technique, but both approaches do not easily apply to large systems, i.e. more than ten
electrons, due to their computational cost. Nevertheless, the FN-DMC method has given accurate
positron aﬃnities, as well as electron aﬃnities [20], for systems up to twelve electrons, both atoms
and molecules, exploiting the cancellation of nodal errors [12].

In the quest for stable positronic complexes, we studied the potential surface for e+LiH by FN-
DMC calculations [21] and found that the equilibrium distance and the vibrational transitions are
diﬀerent from those of LiH, opening the possibility for a spectroscopic detection of this compound.
However, the LiH adiabatic positron aﬃnity (APA) is larger than the dissociation energy (DE), and
a third body would be required to dissipate the excess energy. We suggested to start from a van der
Waals complex of LiH with a rare gas, and to attach the positron to this so that the rare gas should
dissipate the excess energy. Similar consideration can be extracted from the work by Mitroy and
Ryzhikh [22], where they employed a full non-adiabatic approach and ECG functions to establish
the stability of e+LiH.

To avoid this complex mechanism, in this Letter we investigate other systems to see if we can
ﬁnd a molecule whose APA is smaller than the DE, allowing the positron to be attached and to
form the complex without the intervention of a third body. If the spectroscopic properties of this
compound diﬀer from those of the parent molecule, it could be a good candidate for experimental
observation.

We have performed accurate calculations of the total energy for e+BeO and e+LiF systems at
various internuclear distances by means of FN-DMC. These results allow us to obtain the equilibrium
distances for both molecules and to compute the vibrational frequencies.

In the FN-DMC algorithm we sample a distribution of conﬁgurations in 3N dimensional space
that represents Ψ0ΨT , where Ψ0 is the ground state wave function having the same nodal surfaces

of the trial wave function ΨT . Using this distribution we obtain a MC estimate of the ﬁxed node
energy E0 using the mixed estimator

In this equation fi(ra) is a function that contains explicitly the dependence on the spatial coordinates
of the positron and ki is a vector of parameters for the i–th term of the linear expansion.

While the φα,β orbitals were obtained by means of standard SCF calculations on the parent
neutral molecule, the other parameters of ΨT were optimized minimizing the variance of the local
energy using a ﬁxed sample of conﬁgurations. Although this method produces wave functions whose
properties are generally less accurate than those obtained by minimizing the energy [27], it is much
faster. Moreover, the FN-DMC energy value depends only on the location of the nodal surfaces
of the electronic part of the wave function, so that it is not extremely important to have the best
possible description of its positronic part. Nevertheless, if one is interested in properties diﬀerent
from the energy, whose accuracy is strongly dependent on the quality of the trial wave function (for
example the δ(r+−)), a re-optimization of all the wave function parameters is needed [14].

All the FN-DMC simulations were carried out using a target population of 5000 conﬁgurations
and a time step of 0.001 hartree−1. Few more simulations employing a time step of 0.0005 hartree−1
were run to check for the absence of the time step bias in the mean energy values. The FN-DMC
energy results for various internuclear distances of e+LiF and e+BeO are shown in Table 1.

We ﬁtted these energy values by means of a second order polynomial and computed equilibrium
geometrical parameters and the fundamental vibrational wavenumber ωe for the two complexes
e+7Li19F and e+9Be16O. All the results are collected in Table 2.

Comparing the results in Table 2 with the experimental values

[28] for 7Li19F (Re = 2.955
bohr, ωe = 910.34 cm−1) and 9Be16O (Re = 2.515 bohr, ωe = 1487.32 cm−1), we note that after the
addition of the positron both molecules have larger equilibrium distances and vibrational frequencies.
While the increase of Re is similar to the one we found for e+LiH [21] and can be rationalized
invoking the repulsive interaction of the positron with the nuclei, the increase of stiﬀness of the two
bonds is an unexpected result. However, it must be pointed out that the computed frequencies have
an estimated statistical accuracy of the order of 10%, and this means that care must be taken in
discussing the change of this property.

In a previous work [12] we computed the total energies for LiF (-107.4069(9) hartree) and BeO
(-89.7854(13) hartree) at their equilibrium distances by means of FN-DMC. Together with the Emin
values shown in Table 2, these energies allow us to compute the adiabatic positron aﬃnity (APA)
for these two systems, namely 0.022(1) hartree for e+LiF, and 0.025(2) hartree for e+BeO. These
two values are smaller than the APA for the e+LiH (0.0366(1) hartree). This result was already

3

observed for the vertical PA [12], and is in contrast with the fact that the dipole moment of LiF
(µ =6.33 Debye) and BeO (µ =6.26 Debye) are larger than the one of LiH (µ =5.88 Debye) [29].
This indicates that the dipole moment is not suﬃcient to predict a qualitative trend in the PA, and
that this value strongly depends on the speciﬁc features of each molecule.

[8], and the FN-DMC results for O (-75.0518(4) hartree), F (-99.7176(3) hartree)

As far as the dissociation of these complexes is concerned, care must be taken in choosing balanced
values for the energies of the fragments for the possible dissociation channels. For a positron-diatomic
molecule complex e+MX, where M=Li or Be and X=O or F, the possible fragmentations are e+M +
X, M+ + PsX, M + e+X, and PsM + X+. Although not all the energy values of the fragments are
known, one can safely assume that the PsM + X+ dissociation pattern has the highest energy with
respect to the other possibilities. This is due ﬁrstly to the large ionization potential of X (0.5005
hartree for O, and 0.6403 hartree for F) [30], at least twice as large as the positronium (Ps) ground
state energy (-0.25 hartree); secondly, to the usually small binding energy of Ps to metal atoms (for
instance, the binding energy of Ps to Li in the PsLi complex is just 0.01158 hartree [8]). Moreover,
we believe it is reasonable to discard also the M + e+X channel, since the possibility of obtaining
binding between e+ and X is hindered by the small polarizability of X. To support this conclusion,
we stress that even for HF and H2O, that are both polar molecules, DMC did not show binding with
the positron [12]. Although this is not a proof, it strongly suggests that e+O and e+F probably
are not bound. Accepting these conclusions, we are left only with e+M + X and M+ + PsX as
possible fragmentations. To compute the total energy for both channels we use the ECG results for
e+Li (-7.532323 hartree), e+Be (-14.669042 hartree), Li+ (-7.279913 hartree), and Be (-14.667355
hartree)
[31],
[11]. Moreover, we estimate the Be+
PsO (-75.3177(5) hartree), and PsF (-100.0719(8) hartree)
energy (-14.3248 hartree) subtracting the ionization potential (0.3426 hartree)
[30] to the total
energy of Be. Using these results, we end up with an energy of -107.2499(3) hartree for e+Li and
F, and an energy of -107.3518(8) hartree for Li+ and PsF. This fragmentation, similar to the one
found for e+LiH (i.e. Li+ and PsH), is primarily driven by the small value of the Li ionization
potential. Diﬀerently, for e+BeO we obtain -89.6642(5) hartree for Be+ and PsO, and -89.7208(4)
hartree for e+Be and O, so that the most stable dissociation fragments present a positron-atom
bound state. Using the lowest energy dissociation threshold for the two systems one gets a DE
of 0.080(1) hartree for e+LiF, and 0.090(2) hartree for e+BeO. Both these values are larger than
the APA, and this fact means that the two positron-molecule complexes do not dissociate after
positron addition to the parent molecules. This outcome is diﬀerent from what we found for the
addition of e+ to LiH, where the e+LiH complex breaks up due to the excess of the APA with
respect to the DE [21]. Therefore, it does not appear necessary for LiF and BeO to use a third
body, and a simple positron addition will give birth to stable complexes in rotovibrational excited
states. As previously stated, the possibility to produce these stable species could give the chance to
experimentally detect stable positron complexes. Roughly speaking, a mean lifetime on the order of
10−9 seconds is expected for these systems, and this may be large enough to allow a spectroscopical
analysis in the reaction chamber by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy if a suﬃcient
concentration of e+MX can be produced, and if the frequency shift after positron attachment is large
enough that the vibrational spectrum of the complex does not overlap with the neutral molecule one.
Unfortunately the large uncertainty in ωe does not allow a quantitative prediction of this frequency
shift. Moreover, positrons having kinetic energy larger than the diﬀerence DE-APA can open the
various fragmentation channels depending on the excess of their relative energies. For instance, the
collision between positron and BeO can produce e+Be and O as fragments, so that the annihilation
of e+ with the electronic cloud of Be can be directly recorded from the 2 γ photons. Moreover, it
might be possible to detect the stable state of PsF, a system that, diﬀerently from PsCl and PsBr,
has not been prepared in solution [3].

In conclusion, we have presented accurate APA and DE for e+LiF and e+BeO systems computed
by means of FN-DMC. These results allow us to discuss possible mechanisms of formation for
positron-molecule complexes by direct attachment of e+ to the molecules, and the possibility to
produce e+M and PsX systems. It should be now interesting to compute the Γ2γ annihilation rate

4

for these complexes, in order to predict their mean lifetime after e+ addition. Unfortunately, more
technical work on the method appears to be necessary before these calculations can be carried out
for these large systems.

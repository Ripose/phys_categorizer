Abstract

Several gage-equivalent forms (including some novel ones) of the Schr¨o-
dinger equation for a hydrogenlike atom in a time-dependent electric
ﬁeld of a laser pulse are presented. These forms allow to develop a
perturbation theory for both small and rather large intensities of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Exploring the interaction between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and matter is
the major and oldest issue of both classical and quantum physics. It has a
number of branches. One of them is the interaction of a strong laser ﬁeld with
atoms and molecules. Here the concept of a “strong ﬁeld” implies the ﬁeld
which is comparable with an electric ﬁeld in an atom, which binds electrons
to nucleus. The strong ﬁeld may result in single or multiple ionization of an
atom or molecule. By studying the energy and angular distributions of the

1

ionized electrons physicists expect to obtain information about the structure
of a quantum object and the ionization mechanisms.

The coming into being of the theory of such processes is due to pioneering
works of Keldysh [1] and his followers. Since then, a number of studies have
appeared analyzing pluses and minuses of this theory, investigating its lim-
its and suggesting corrections for its improvement. Just citing these works
would take a half of the journal volume and therefore we cite only several re-
cent review papers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], where trends in this ﬁeld of science can be
seen. However, the theoretical and mathematical content of the majority of
works in recent years has shifted towards development of numerical schemes
for solving basic equations. This is due to the intense growth of computa-
tional facilities of modern computers. Despite the enormous progress of such
approach in understanding the processes taking place under the action of an
intense laser pulse, the analytical models remain of very current importance,
since they have the power of prediction. The exact solution of the considered
problem is known only for a very small set of local potentials, in particu-
lar, for an oscillating potential (see, for instance, [8, 9]). However, there is
no ionized states in this potential. For the simplest practical case, namely
for the hydrogen atom, one already must consider diﬀerent approximations
whose mathematical correctness is not always clear.

In this connection the property of gage invariance of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is often helpful. In turn, this property allows to obtain various equiv-
alent forms of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) related to
each other through unitary transformations which, as is known, lead to the
invariance of the physical quantities given by quadratic forms of the wave
function. Let us recall that the Maxwell equations can be written in terms of
the scalar and vector potentials, U(~r, t) and ~A(~r, t). These potentials quite
unambiguously determine the observed characteristics of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, namely the electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities, ~E and ~H. At that,
the potentials themselves are deﬁned ambiguously. For example, two sets of
potentials ( ~A′, U ′) and ( ~A, U), where

~A′ = ~A + ~
∇

f,

U ′ = U

give the same electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities for an arbitrary function
f (~r, t).

The forms of TDSE using diﬀerent gage transformations of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld and some of the corresponding useful consequences are the

2

subject of this work. The atomic units e = me = ¯h = 1 are used throughout.
According to this system of units the light velocity c is about 137.

2 Coordinate representation

First of all it should be noted that the ﬁeld intensity is, upon deﬁnition,
related to the potential as follows:

~E(~r, t) =

~A(~r, t)

U(~r, t).

(1)

In the so-called Coulomb gage it is assumed that

div ~A = 0.

In the simplest study one makes a physical assumption about a weak depen-
dence of the scalar potential on the coordinate within the atom, i.e.

≃
which allows to neglect the gradient of the scalar potential in (1). This leads
to a well known dipole approximation

U(~r, t)

U(0, t),

~A(~r, t)

~A(0, t) = ~A(t).

≃

Setting ~A(t) = ~eA(t), where ~e is the unit polarization vector, we obtain
a linearly polarized laser beam. The condition of the absence of the ﬁeld
outside the time interval (0, T ), where the laser pulse acts, takes the form

Here ~E(t) =
~e∂A(t)/c∂t. The notation ΦL(~r, t) indicates the so-called
length form of TDSE. In this context, Ψ(~r, t)
ΦV (~r, t) is sometimes referred
to as the velocity form. Usually one requires a good numerical algorithm to
give a coincidence (within the accuracy) of the computed observed quantities
(the level occupations, angular and energy distributions of the ionized elec-
trons and etc.) in the length and velocity forms. In the exact theory they
must be identical.

In (13) and (15) one can return back to the variables (~r, t) and see that
the argument of the exponent in (8) does not explicitly depend on A. This
is a footprint of a quasi-classical approximation.

For estimating the value of A we consider a particular case of the laser

pulse shape which is frequently utilized in calculations:

moderate carrier frequency. In this range the experimental data have been
obtained which allow to check the correctness of the derived expansion in the
reversed powers of the ﬁeld intensity.

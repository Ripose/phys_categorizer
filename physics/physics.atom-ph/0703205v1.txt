Atomi Compton pro(cid:28)les (CPs) are a very important property whih provide us information

about the momentum distribution of atomi eletrons. Therefore, for CPs of heavy atoms, rela-

tivisti e(cid:27)ets are expeted to be important, warranting a relativisti treatment of the problem. In

this paper, we present an e(cid:30)ient approah aimed at ab initio alulations of atomi CPs within

a Dira-Hartree-Fok (DHF) formalism, employing kinetially-balaned Gaussian basis funtions.

The approah is used to ompute the CPs of noble gases ranging from He to Rn, and the results have

been ompared to the experimental and other theoretial data, wherever possible. The in(cid:29)uene of

the quality of the basis set on the alulated CPs has also been systematially investigated.

INTRODUCTION

Reent years have seen tremendous amount of progress in the (cid:28)eld of relativisti eletroni

struture alulations of atoms and moleules using Dira-equation-based approahes[1℄.

Partiularly noteworthy are the advanes made in the (cid:28)eld of basis-set-based relativisti

eletroni struture theory pioneered by Kim[2℄, and Kagawa[3℄. Although, initially, the

basis-sets employed in the alulations were of the ordinary Slater-type[2, 3℄, however, now-

a-days, the preferred basis funtions are those whih inorporate the so-alled kineti-balane

ondition between the large and the small omponent basis funtions[4, 5, 6℄. The most om-

monly used variety of suh funtions in relativisti eletroni-struture alulations are the

kinetially-balaned Gaussian funtions (KBGFs) whih have not only been instrumental in

avoiding the problem of 'variational ollapse', but have also allowed the import of e(cid:30)ient

algorithms developed in basis-set-based nonrelativisti quantum hemistry. Using suh ba-

sis funtions, alulations are now routinely performed both at the mean-(cid:28)eld Hartree-Fok

(heneforth Dira-Hartree-Fok (DHF)) level[7, 8℄, as well as at the orrelated level, em-

ploying methods suh as the on(cid:28)guration-interation (CI) approah, both for atoms[9℄, and

moleules[10℄.

However, the progress in alulating wave funtions and atomi energies using KGBFs

has not been mathed by the progress in omputing expetation values orresponding to

various physial quantities. For example, atomi Compton pro(cid:28)les (CPs) are a very im-

portant property whih provide us information about the momentum distribution of atomi

eletrons, and help us in interpreting the x-ray Compton sattering data from atoms in the

large momentum-transfer regime[11℄. Compton pro(cid:28)les are also very useful in understand-

ing the bonding properties, as one makes a transition from the atomi sale to the sale of

ondensed matter[11℄. Indeed, the nonrelativisti Shrödinger equation based alulations

of CPs of atomi and moleular systems both within an ab initio, as well as model-potential

based, formalisms are quite well developed[11℄. As reently demonstrated by us, and several

other authors earlier on, that suh nonrelativisti ab initio alulations of CPs an also be

performed on rystalline systems[12℄. However, for systems involving heavy atoms, on intu-

itive grounds one expets that the relativisti e(cid:27)ets will beome quite important, thereby

requiring a relativisti treatment of the problem[13℄. Long time bak Mendelsohn et al.[14℄,

and Bigss et al.[15℄ presented the (cid:28)rst fully-relativisti alulations of atomi CPs whih

2

were performed at the DHF level, employing a (cid:28)nite-di(cid:27)erene based numerial approah.

Yet, sine that time, there has been hardly any ativity in the (cid:28)eld, whih is surprising

given the fat that now relativisti eletroni struture alulations are routinely performed

employing KBGF basis funtions. Therefore, in this work, our aim is to report the (cid:28)rst

alulations of atomi CPs at the DHF level, employing a basis set omposed of KBGFs.

Our approah is based upon analyti formulas for the CP matrix elements with respet to

a KBGF basis set, whose derivation is presented in the Appendix. The DHF alulations

of atomi CPs are presented for the entire rare gas series (He to Rn), and our results are

ompared to experimental data, wherever available. Additionally, our results for Ar, Kr, Xe,

and Rn are also ompared to the DHF results of Mendelsohn et al.[14℄, and Bigss et al.[15℄,

and exellent agreement is obtained between the two sets of alulations.

At this point we would like to larify one important aspet related to the relativisti

e(cid:27)ets whih our alulations are omputing, in light of the fat that there have been several

papers in the literature dealing with a relativisti treatment of Compton sattering of bound

eletrons[16, 17, 18℄. Several authors have pointed out that for very large photon energies,

a fully relativisti treatment, within the framework of quantum-eletrodynamis, of the

Compton sattering from bound eletrons is essential[13℄. When suh a treatment of the

problem is performed, it is not lear whether the Compton sattering ross-setions an at all

be written in terms of Compton pro(cid:28)les[13, 16, 17, 18℄. Our work presented here, however,

does not orrespond to that regime of photon energies. What we mean by the relativisti

e(cid:27)ets here are the hanges in the omputed CPs beause of a relativisti treatment of

the bound eletrons within a Dira Hamiltonian based formalism. Thus, our alulations

assume that the Compton sattering from atomi eletrons an be desribed in terms of

the CPs under the impulse approximation[19℄. The eletron momentum densities needed to

alulate the CPs, however, are omputed from the Dira orbitals of the atomi eletrons.

This approah is idential to the one adopted in the earlier DHF alulations[14, 15℄.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In setion II we present the basi

theoretial formalism behind the present set of alulations. Next in setion III we present

and disuss the results of our alulations. Finally, in setion IV our onlusions, as well

as possible future diretions for further work are disussed. Additionally, in the Appendix

we present the derivation of the losed-form formulas for CPs over KBGFs, used in our

alulations.

II. THEORY

Our theory is based upon the Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian

H =

(cαi ·

pi + c2(βi −

Xi

1) + Vnu(ri)) +

1
rij

,

Xi<j

where c is the speed of light, p is the momentum operator, Vnu(r) is the eletron-nuleus

interation potential, indies i and j label the eletrons of the atom, and rij is the distane

between the ith and j th eletrons. For Vnu(r) a spherial (cid:28)nite-nuleus approximation

is employed, with the radius estimated as 2.2677

number[7℄. The Dira matries are hosen to be α = 

and β = 

, where 0,

I, and σ , represent the 2×2 null, identity and Pauli matries, respetively. Eq. (1) is solved

under the DHF approximation utilizing spherial symmetry with the orbitals of the form

where Pnκ(r) and Qnκ(r) are the radial large and small omponents, and χκm(θ, φ) is the two-

omponent angular part omposed of Clebsh-Gordon oe(cid:30)ients and spherial harmonis.

In the basis-set approah adopted here, the radial parts of the wave funtion are expressed

as linear ombination of radial Gaussian type of funtions

and

where C L

κi and C S

κi , are the expansion oe(cid:30)ients of the large and small omponent basis

funtions, respetively. The large-omponent basis funtion is given by

κi are the normalization oe(cid:30)ients assoiated with the

large and the small omponent basis funtions, respetively.

Under the impulse approximation[19℄, the di(cid:27)erential ross-setion of Compton sattering

of x-rays from many-eletron systems is proportional to the Compton pro(cid:28)le

J(q) =

dpxdpyρ(p),

Z Z

where ρ(p) is the momentum distribution of the eletrons before sattering and q is the

omponent of the momentum of the eletron along the sattering vetor, assumed to be

along the z diretion. Under the mean-(cid:28)eld DHF approximation, for a losed-shell atom,

the expression for the CP redues to

J(q) =

(2ji + 1)Jniκi(q),

X

where ji is the total angular momentum of the ith orbital while, Jniκi is the CP assoiated

where Pniκi(p) and Qniκi(p) are the Fourier transforms of the radial parts of the large and

small omponents, respetively, of the ith oupied orbital (f. Eq. (2)) and are de(cid:28)ned as

Pniκi(p) =

rPniκi(r)jlA(pr)dr,

Qniκi(p) =

where jlA(pr)(jlB(pr)) is the spherial Bessel funtion orresponding to the orbital angular

momentum lA (lB ) of the large (small) omponent. Therefore, alulation of atomi CPs

involves omputation of two types of integrals: (i) radial Fourier Transforms of Eqs. (8) and

(9), and (ii) momentum integrals of the Fourier transformed orbitals in Eq. (7). When one

solves the DHF equation for atoms using the (cid:28)nite-di(cid:27)erene tehniques, then, obviously

the alulation of atomi CPs mandates that both these types integrals be omputed by

means of numerial quadrature. However, for the basis-set-based approah adopted here,

in order to failitate rapid omputation of atomi CPs, it is desirable to obtain losed-form

expressions for both types of integrals with respet to the hosen basis funtions. Indeed,

we have managed to derive losed-form expressions for the atomi CPs with respet to the

with it

and

KBGFs, whih an be easily omputer implemented. It is easy to see that within a KBGF

based approah, the integral of Eq. (7), an be omputed in terms of the following two types

of integrals

and

κi(r), and gS

and small omponent basis funtions gL
expressions for J L;κ

ij (q) and J S;κ

ij (q) expressions was not an easy task, and those formulas,

along with their derivation, are presented in the Appendix. Additionally, elsewhere we have

desribed a Fortran 90 omputer program developed by us, whih uses these expressions to

ompute the atomi CPs from a set of given Dira orbitals expressed as a linear ombination

of KBGFs[20℄.

Here we would like to omment on possible quantitative manifestations of relativisti

e(cid:27)ets in Compton pro(cid:28)les. One obvious way to quantify the relativisti e(cid:27)ets on the CPs

is by omparing the values obtained from the DHF alulations with those obtained from

nonrelativisti HF alulations. There is another way by whih one an judge the in(cid:29)uene

of relativisti e(cid:27)ets on Compton pro(cid:28)les, that is by omparing the orbital CPs of di(cid:27)erent

(cid:28)ne struture omponents. For example, in nonrelativisti alulations, np, nd,. . . orbitals

have only one set of values eah for the orbital CPs. However, in relativisti alulations,

eah suh orbital splits into two (cid:28)ne-struture omponents, i.e., np1/2/np3/2 , nd3/2/nd5/2 ,

whih, if the relativisti e(cid:27)ets are strong, an di(cid:27)er from eah other in a signi(cid:28)ant manner.

Thus, one expets, that under suh situations, the orbital pro(cid:28)les of the two (cid:28)ne-struture

omponents will also be signi(cid:28)antly di(cid:27)erent. Therefore, we will also examine this (cid:16)(cid:28)ne-

struture splitting(cid:17) of the orbital CPs of various atoms to quantify the relativisti e(cid:27)ets.

III. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS

In this setion we present our DHF results on the atomi pro(cid:28)les of the rare gases. The

DHF orbitals of various atoms were omputed using the KBGF based REATOM ode of

Mohanty and Clementi[21℄. During the DHF alulations the value of the speed of light

used was c = 137.037 a.u. Additionally, for obtaining the radius of the nuleus for the

6

(cid:28)nite-nuleus approximation desription of Vnu(r), values of atomi mass A were taken to

be 4.026, 20.18, 39.948, 83.80, 131.3, and 222.0 for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn, respetively.

Using the orbitals obtained from the DHF alulations, the atomi CPs were omputed using

our omputer program COMPTON[20℄. Next we present our results for the rare gas atoms,

one-by-one. In order to investigate the basis-set dependene of the CPs, for eah atom, two

types of basis sets were used: (i) a large universal basis set proposed by Malli et al. [22℄,

and (ii) a smaller basis set tailor-made for the individual atom.

A. He

For He, DHF alulations were performed with: (i) well-tempered basis set of Matsuoka

and Huzinaga[23℄ employing 12s funtions[23℄, and (ii) the universal basis set using 22s

funtions[22℄. The omputed CPs are plotted in Fig. III A as a funtion of the momentum

transfer q . The results of our alulations for some seleted values of q are presented in

table I. For the sake of omparison, the same table also ontains the nonrelativisti HF

results of Clementi and Roetti[24℄, as well as the experimental results of Eisenberger and

Reed[25℄. Upon inspetion of the table, following trends emerge: (i) Our relativisti CPs

omputed with the well-tempered and the universal basis sets are in exellent agreement

with eah other. This implies that the smaller well-tempered basis set is virtually omplete,

as far as the CPs are onerned. (ii) Our DHF CPs are in exellent agreement with the

nonrelativisti HF CPs of Clementi and Roetti[24℄. This, obviously, is a onsequene of the

fat that the relativisti e(cid:27)ets are negligible for a light atom suh as He. (iii) Generally,

the agreement between the theoretial and the experimental CPs is exellent, implying that

the eletron-orrelation e(cid:27)ets do not make a signi(cid:28)ant ontribution in this ase.

B. Ne

DHF alulations were performed for Ne using: (i) (14s, 14p) well-tempered basis set of

Matsuoka and Huzinaga[23℄, and the (ii) large (32s, 29p) universal basis set of Malli et al.[22℄.

In order to failitate diret omparison with the experiments, the valene CPs (exluding the

ontribution from the 1s ore orbital) obtained from our alulations are presented in table

II. They are also ompared to the nonrelativisti HF results of Clementi and Roetti[24℄,

lassi experiment of Eisenberger[26℄, and more reent experiment of Lahmam-Bennani et

al.[27℄. Additionally, the total Compton pro(cid:28)les of Ne (inluding the ontribution of the 1s

orbital), omputed using both the aforesaid basis sets, are plotted in Fig. 2.

Upon inspeting table II we notie the following trends: (i) pro(cid:28)les omputed using two

di(cid:27)erent sets are again in very good agreement with eah other, implying that both the basis

sets are essentially omplete, (ii) our relativisti pro(cid:28)les are in quite good agreement with

the nonrelativisti HF pro(cid:28)les[24℄ essentially implying that even in Ne, the relativisti e(cid:27)ets

are quite negligible. As far as omparison with the experiments is onerned, for smaller

values of q there is slight disagreement with the theory whih progressively disappears as

one approahes the large momentum-transfer regime. This suggests that eletron-orrelation

e(cid:27)ets possibly play an important role in the small momentum transfer regime.

Finally we examine the individual orbital CPs of the Ne atom in Fig. 3. The maximum

ontribution to the total CP for small values of momentum transfer omes from the 2s

orbital, while in the same region, the smallest ontribution omes from the 1s ore orbital.

The orbital CP of the 2s orbital varies rapidly with respet to q and beomes quite small for

q

2 a.u. On the other hand the orbital pro(cid:28)le of the 1s orbital shows the least dispersion

≥

with respet to q , and has the largest magnitude in the large q region, as ompared to other

the 2s pro(cid:28)le for q

the 1s pro(cid:28)le. Another pointer to the insigni(cid:28)ane of the relativisti e(cid:27)ets for Ne is the

fat that the di(cid:27)erene in the values of the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 is quite small for all values of q .

Next, we disuss our alulated Compton pro(cid:28)les of Ar. The DHF alulations on Ar

atom were performed using the following two basis sets: (i) smaller (16s,16p) well-tempered

basis set of Matsuoka and Huzinaga[23℄, and the (ii) large (32s,29p) universal basis set of

Malli et al.[22℄. Calulated total CPs of Ar, for a seleted number of q values in the range 0

Ar plotted as a funtion of the momentum transfer q . From Ar onwards, CP results of

Mendelsohn et al.

[14℄ exist, whih were omputed from the DHF orbitals obtained from

(cid:28)nite-di(cid:27)erene-based alulations. If our alulated CPs are orret, they should be in good

agreements with those of Mendelsohn et al.[14℄. Therefore, it is indeed heartening for us to

note that our CP results omputed with the universal basis set[22℄ are in perfet agreement

with those of Mendelsohn et al.[14℄ to the deimal plaes, and for the q points, reported

by them. As a matter of fat even our CPs obtained using the smaller well-tempered basis

set[23℄, disagree with those of Mendelsohn et al.[14℄ by very small amounts. Thus, this gives

us on(cid:28)dene about the essential orretness of our approah.

When ompared to the experiments, for q = 0, our value of CP of 5.054 omputed with

universal basis set, is in exellent agreement with the experimental value of 5.058[25℄. For
0.1a.u.≤
q
≥

0.9a.u., however, our theoretial results underestimate the experimental results by small

0.8a.u. our results begin to overestimate the experimental ones slightly. For

amounts. The nonrelativisti HF results[24℄ also exhibit the same pattern with respet to the

experimental results. Upon omparing our CPs to the nonrelativisti HF CPs[24℄, we notie

that the two sets of values di(cid:27)er slightly for smaller values of q . However, the di(cid:27)erene

between the two begins to beome insigni(cid:28)ant as we approah larger values of q , suggesting

Finally we examine the ontributions of the individual orbitals to the atomi CP in Fig.

5, whih presents the orbital pro(cid:28)les of all the orbitals of Ar. We observe the following

trends: (i) 3s pro(cid:28)le has the maximum value at q = 0, followed by 3p3/2/3p1/2 pro(cid:28)les.

The minimum value at q = 0 orresponds to the 1s pro(cid:28)le. (ii) Pro(cid:28)les of outer orbitals

vary more rapidly with q , as ompared to the inner ones. In other words, pro(cid:28)le (cid:29)attening

ours as one moves inwards from the valene to the ore orbitals. (iii) Again no signi(cid:28)ant

(cid:28)ne-struture splitting is observed, in that the pro(cid:28)les of np3/2 and np1/2 orbitals di(cid:27)ered

from eah other by small amounts, pointing to the smallness of relativisti e(cid:27)ets.

D. Kr

Now, we disuss our DHF results of Compton pro(cid:28)le of Kr. The DHF alulations on

Kr atom were performed using the following two basis sets: (i) smaller (20s,15p, 9d) basis

set of Koga et al.[28℄, and the (ii) large (32s, 29p, 20d) universal basis set of Malli et al.[22℄.

Figure 5: Orbital Compton pro(cid:28)les of Ar, plotted as funtions of the momentum transfer q . In

(q = 0), the pro(cid:28)les orrespond to 3s, 3p3/2/3p1/2 , 2s,

orb

2p3/2/2p1/2 , and 1s orbitals. Note that for all the ases, pro(cid:28)les of p3/2 and p1/2 orbitals are

virtually idential. These pro(cid:28)les were omputed using the universal basis set[22℄.

also ontains the nonrelativisti HF pro(cid:28)les omputed by Clementi and Roetti[24℄, DHF

pro(cid:28)les alulated by Mendelsohn et al.[14℄, and the experimental results of Eisenberger and

Reed[25℄.

In Figs. 6 and 7, respetively, our total and orbital CPs of Kr, are plotted as a funtion of

the momentum transfer q . Upon omparing our CPs of Kr obtained using two basis sets we

note that: (i) for small values of q , the values obtained using the smaller basis set of Koga et

al.[28℄ are slightly smaller than the ones obtained using the universal basis set, and (ii) for

large values of q , the results obtained using the two basis sets are in exellent agreement with

eah other. Next, we ompare our alulated CPs with those omputed by Mendelsohn et

al.[14℄ using the numerial orbitals obtained in their DHF alulations. From table IV it is

obvious that, for the all the q values for whih Mendelsohn et al.[14℄ reported their CPs, our

pro(cid:28)les obtained using the universal basis set[22℄, are in exat agreement with their results.

As a matter of fat, the agreement between the results of Mendelsohn et al.[14℄, and our

results omputed using the smaller basis set of Koga et al.[28℄, is also exellent.

Upon omparing our results to experimental ones, we see that our universal basis set value

of J(q = 0) = 7.187, is in exellent agreement with the experimental value of 7.205[25℄.

Figure 6: DHF Compton pro(cid:28)le of Kr, J(q), omputed using the universal basis set[22℄, plotted as

For other values of momentum transfer in the range 0.1 a.u.≤

q

≤

1.0 a.u., although the

agreement between our results and the experiments is slightly worse, yet our results are

loser to the experimental value as ompared to the nonrelativisti HF results[24℄. For higher

values of momentum transfer, our DHF results are fairly lose to the HF results suggesting

that in the region of large q , relativisti e(cid:27)ets are unimportant. Thus, we onlude that

from Kr onwards, relativisti e(cid:27)ets make their presene felt in the small q region.

Finally, we investigate the orbital CPs of Kr in Fig. 7, whih presents the plots of the

pro(cid:28)les of outer orbitals starting from 3d3/2 to 4p3/2 . As far as the general trends of the

orbital pro(cid:28)les are onerned, they are similar to what we observed for the ases of Ne and

Ar, exept for one important aspet. Unlike the Ne and Ar, for Kr for the (cid:28)rst time we

begin to observe the (cid:28)ne struture splitting in the orbital pro(cid:28)les of 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 orbitals

in the low q region, as is obvious from Fig. 7. For example, for q = 0, orresponding
values are J4p3/2 = 0.508, and J4p1/2 = 0.496, amounting to a di(cid:27)erene of ≈

2%. This is in

omplete agreement with our earlier observation that the relativisti e(cid:27)ets make signi(cid:28)ant

ontributions to the CPs of Kr in the small q region.

E. Xe

In this setion, we disuss our results on the relativisti Compton pro(cid:28)les of Xe. The

DHF alulations on Xe atom were performed using the following two basis sets: (i) smaller

(22s,18p, 12d) basis set of Koga et al.[28℄, and the (ii) large (32s, 29p, 20d) universal basis

set of Malli et al.[22℄. Total CPs of Xe, for seleted values of momentum transfer in the

range 0 a.u.≤

q

≤

100 a.u., are presented in table V. For the sake of omparison, the same

table also ontains DHF, and the nonrelativisti HF, pro(cid:28)les alulated by Mendelsohn et

al.[14℄. Here, we are unable to ompare our results with the experiments, beause, to the

best of our knowledge, no experimental measurements of the CPs of Xe exist.

Additionally, in Figs. 8 and 9, respetively, we present the plots of our total and orbital

CPs of Xe. Upon omparing our total CPs obtained using the two basis sets we (cid:28)nd that,

as before, they disagree for smaller values of q , with the CPs obtained using the smaller

basis set[28℄ being slightly lower than those obtained using the universal basis set[22℄. As

is obvious from table V, that for q

1.5 a.u., the two sets of basis funtions yield virtually

≥

idential results. In the same table, when we ompare our results to the earlier DHF results of

Mendelsohn et al.[14℄, we (cid:28)nd that for all the q values, the agreement between our universal

As far as atomi Rn is onerned, to the best of our knowledge, no prior experimental

studies of its Compton pro(cid:28)les exist. However, Biggs et al.[15℄did perform DHF alulations

of this atom, using a (cid:28)nite di(cid:27)erene approah, with whih we ompare our results later on

in this setion. Our DHF alulations on Rn atom were performed using the following two

basis sets: (i) smaller (25s,21p, 15d, 10f ) basis set of Koga et al.[29℄, and the (ii) large (32s,

29p, 20d, 15f ) universal basis set of Malli et al.[22℄. Total CPs of Rn, for seleted values of
momentum transfer in the range 0 a.u.≤

100 a.u., are presented in table VI.

Figure 10: DHF Compton pro(cid:28)le of Rn, omputed using the universal basis set[22℄, and plotted as

a funtion of the momentum transfer q .

As for other atoms, we (cid:28)nd that our total CPs obtained using the two basis sets disagree

for smaller values of q , with the CPs obtained using the smaller basis set of Koga et al.[29℄

being slightly smaller than those obtained using the universal basis set[22℄. From table VI

we dedue that for q

4.0 a.u., the two sets of basis funtions yield virtually idential values

≥

of CPs. In the same table, when we ompare our results to the earlier DHF alulations

of Biggs et al.[15℄, we (cid:28)nd that for all the q values, the agreement between our universal

basis-set based CPs, and their results, is perfet up to the deimal plaes reported by them.

Of all the rare gas atoms onsidered so far, on the intuitive grounds we expet the rela-

tivisti e(cid:27)ets to be the strongest in Rn. Indeed, this is what we on(cid:28)rm upon investigating

the orbital pro(cid:28)les presented in Fig. 11. As is obvious from the (cid:28)gure, the splitting between

the orbitals pro(cid:28)les of 6p3/2 and 6p1/2 orbitals is quite big, and persists for a large range of

q values. Similar to the ase of Xe, here also for smaller values of q , J6p3/2(q) > J6p1/2(q),
while for large q values, opposite is the ase. For q = 0, J6p3/2 = 0.644, while J6p1/2 = 0.551,

amounting to a di(cid:27)erene of ≈
between the pro(cid:28)les of 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 orbitals although is not quite that large, yet it is

15%, whih is quite substantial. The (cid:28)ne-struture splitting

visible in Fig. 11. At q = 0,J5d5/2 = 0.185, and J5d3/2 = 0.179, leading to a di(cid:27)erene of

3%, whih is quite signi(cid:28)ant for an inner orbital. Thus, we onlude that the relativisti

≈

e(cid:27)ets are quite substantial in ase of Rn, and, therefore, it will be useful if experiments are

pro(cid:28)les are quite large. Even the splitting of 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 pro(cid:28)les is visible. These pro(cid:28)les were

G. Z dependene of relativisti e(cid:27)ets on Compton Pro(cid:28)les

In earlier setions, while disussing relativisti e(cid:27)ets on Compton pro(cid:28)les, we notied

that they were most prominent for small momentum transfers. Moreover, one intuitively

expets the relativisti e(cid:27)ets to inrease with inreasing atomi number Z . In this setion

our aim is to perform a quantitative investigation of relativisti e(cid:27)ets on quantum pro(cid:28)les,

as a funtion of Z , for both large and small values of momentum transfer. We notied

that for small momentum transfers, DHF values of J were smaller than their nonrelativisti

ounterparts, while for large momentum transfer opposite was the ase. Therefore, for a

given value of momentum transfer q , we quantify relativisti e(cid:27)ets in terms of |
J(HF)

|, whih is the magnitude of the di(cid:27)erene of relativisti DHF value of the Compton
pro(cid:28)le (J(DHF)), and the nonrelativisti HF value of the pro(cid:28)le (J(HF)). We obtain J(HF)

J(DHF)

−

by using a large value of the veloity of light (c = 104

a.u.) in the DHF alulations. We

explore the dependene of this quantity on Z , for two values of momentum transfer, q = 0,

q = 0 is 2.36 while for q = Z , the slope is 1.35. Of ourse, these results are based upon

data points generated by six values of Z (rare gas series), and onsequently an only be

treated as suggestive. But the results suggest: (i) super-linear dependene of the relativisti

e(cid:27)et on quantum pro(cid:28)les in both momentum transfer regimes, and (ii) stronger in(cid:29)uene of

relativity in the small momentum transfer regime as ompared to the large one. Of ourse,

this exploration an be re(cid:28)ned further by separately investigating the Z dependene of these

e(cid:27)ets on the ore and valene pro(cid:28)les. Additionally, this investigation an be extended to

a larger number of atoms to obtain a larger set of data points. However, these alulations

are beyond the sope of the present work, and will be presented elsewhere.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this paper, we presented an approah aimed at omputing the relativisti Compton

pro(cid:28)les of atoms within the DHF approximation, when the atomi orbitals are represented

as linear ombinations of kinetially-balaned set of Gaussian funtions. The approah was

applied to ompute the CPs of rare gas atoms ranging from He to Rn, and results were

ompared to the experimental pro(cid:28)les, and theoretial pro(cid:28)les of other authors, wherever

suh data was available. Additionally, the in(cid:29)uene of size and type of basis set was examined

by performing alulations on eah atom with two basis sets: (i) a well-known smaller basis

set, and (ii) a large universal basis set proposed by Malli et al.[22℄.

Upon omparing our results with the experiments, we found that for lighter atoms He,

Ne, and Ar, the agreement was similar to what one obtains from the nonrelativisti HF

alulations, indiating lak of any signi(cid:28)ant relativisti e(cid:27)ets for these atoms. For Kr,

we notied that for smaller momentum transfer values, DHF results were in better agree-

ment with the experiments, as ompared to the HF results. For heavier atoms, Xe and

Rn, unfortunately no experimental data is available. Yet another quantitative indiator of

the importane of relativisti e(cid:27)ets is the (cid:28)ne-struture splitting of the pro(cid:28)les, i.e., the

di(cid:27)erene in the pro(cid:28)les of np1/2/np3/2 et., whih will have idential pro(cid:28)les in nonrela-

tivisti alulations. We found that this splitting beomes larger with the inreasing atomi

number of the atom, thus justifying a relativisti treatment of the problem for heavy atoms.

Additionally, by omparing our results with the nonrelativisti HF results we found that the

relativisti e(cid:27)ets are most prominent in the region of small momentum transfer, while at

large momentum transfer, their ontribution is muh smaller.

In the literature, we were able to loate prior theoretial alulation of relativisti CPs of

atoms only from one group, namely the DHF alulations of Mendelsohn et al.[14℄ and Biggs

et al.[15℄, performed on Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn, employing a (cid:28)nite-di(cid:27)erene based approah.

The CPs omputed by them[14, 15℄ for these atoms were found to be in perfet agreement

with our results omputed using the universal basis set. This testi(cid:28)es to the orretness of

our approah, and suggests that by using a large basis set, it is possible to reah the auray

of (cid:28)nite-di(cid:27)erene approahes in relativisti alulations, not just on total energies[22℄, but

also on expetation values.

Having investigated the in(cid:29)uene of the relativisti e(cid:27)ets, the next logial step will

25

be to go beyond the mean-(cid:28)eld DHF treatment, and inorporate the in(cid:29)uene of eletron

orrelations on atomi CPs, within a relativisti framework. Suh a treatment an be within

a relativisti CI framework[9℄, or an also be performed within a perturbation-theoreti

formalism. Work along these lines is urrently underway in our group, and the results will

be submitted for publiation in future.

OVER KINETICALLY BALANCED GAUSSIAN BASIS SETS

During our disussion here, we use the same notations for various quantities as adopted

in setion II.Our aim here is to evaluate the losed form expressions for the following two

integrals

whih, as explained in setion II, are needed to ompute the orbital (and total) atomi

CPs when the KBGF based numerial formalism is employed to solve the DHF equations.

First, we will obtain expressions for gL

As before, we seek a relation between nκ and lB , whih is summarized in table VII.

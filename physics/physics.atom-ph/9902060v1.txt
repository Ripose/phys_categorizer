Using a Hartree-Fock mesh method and a conﬁguration interaction approach based on a general-
ized Gaussian basis set we investigate the behaviour of the exchange and correlation energies of small
atoms and molecules, namely the helium and lithium atom as well as the hydrogen molecule, in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld covering the regime B = 0 − 100a.u. In general the importance of the
exchange energy to the binding properties of atoms or molecules increases strongly with increasing
ﬁeld strength. This is due to the spin-ﬂip transitions and in particular due to the contributions of the
tightly bound hydrogenic states which are involved in the corresponding ground states of diﬀerent
symmetries. In contrast to the exchange energy the correlation energy becomes less relevant with
increasing ﬁeld strength. This holds for the individual conﬁgurations constituting the ground state
and for the crossovers of the global ground state.

I. INTRODUCTION

Particle systems in strong magnetic ﬁelds represent a source of complex nonlinear phenomena which have their
origin in the competing particle-particle and magnetic interactions. Considering the simplest of all possible systems,
namely the hydrogen atom [1], we encounter a variety of diﬀerent properties and qualitatively new eﬀects. Leaving
aside the inherent two-body character of the system [2] let us concentrate on the evolution of the electronic properties
with increasing ﬁeld strength. Since the symmetry gradually changes with increasing ﬁeld strength from a ﬁeld-free
spherical to a cylindrical one in the high ﬁeld limit we encounter a strong rearrangement of the electronic wave function
which is particularly dramatic in the so-called intermediate regime for which the strength of the two interactions are
of comparable order of magnitude. The large number of investigations on the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld
during the past twenty years provided us with a detailed understanding of the quantum properties of the atom. It
thereby became a prominent example for a low-dimensional chaotic dynamical system as well as a testing ground for
the development of semiclassical theories of nonintegrable systems [3].

In contrast to the hydrogen atom our knowledge on the behaviour and properties of many electron atoms in strong
magnetic ﬁelds is still in its infancy. There exists a moderate number of investigations on the ground and low-lying
excited states of the helium atom for ﬁeld strengths ranging from the weak to the high ﬁeld regime (see refs. [4–7]
and references therein). Very recently precise calculations of a considerable number of excited states of diﬀerent
symmetries [8] were performed for a wide range of astrophysically relevant ﬁeld strengths. As a result a successful
comparison of the corresponding stationary transitions with the astronomically observed spectrum of the magnetic
white dwarf GD229 could be performed resulting in a strong evidence for the existence of helium in the atmosphere
of this object [9]. For atoms with more than two electrons there exist only few investigatons of partially qualitative
character which focus almost exclusively on the high ﬁeld regime (see, for example, ref. [10] and references therein).
For the lithium atom there are two recent investigations [11,12] which cover also the intermediate regime of ﬁeld
strengths.

In the case of molecules the situation is somewhat similar. The one-electron problem, i.e. the hydrogen molecular ion
H +
2 in a magnetic ﬁeld, has been studied in some detail (see refs. [13] and references therein) including the situation
of an arbitrary orientation of the internuclear axis with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld axis. A careful quantitative
investigation of the hydrogen molecule including a correct description of the ground state for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths,
has however been performed only very recently (see refs. [14–16]). Nevertheless a number of interesting features have
been detected like, for example, magnetic ﬁeld induced chemical binding mechanisms or crossovers of ground states
due to spin or internal energy shifts.

In view of the above-described dramatic changes of the electronic structure and properties of atoms and molecules
in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld it is natural to ask the question how the diﬀerent contributions to the total energies
change with changing ﬁeld strength. More precisely: how does the exchange and correlation energy behave if the ﬁeld

1

is turned on and increased from the weak ﬁeld to the high ﬁeld regime ? This question is of immediate relevance to a
better understanding of the binding properties of inhomogeneous electronic systems in strong ﬁelds. Furthermore our
investigation is also motivated by the persisting need of density functionals in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds
[17–19] whose construction requires detailed information about the inﬂuence of the external ﬁeld on the electronic
structure. The aim of the present paper is to study the behaviour of the exchange and correlation energies for a broad
range of ﬁeld strengths for the ground states of some selected small atoms and molecules, namely the helium and
lithium atoms and the hydrogen molecule.

In detail we proceed as follows. Section 2 contains a brief discussion of relevant theoretical aspects as well as an
outline of the diﬀerent computational methods used to investigate the electronic structure of atoms and molecules
in strong magnetic ﬁelds. Since both the theoretical background as well as the underlying computational techniques
are rather sophisticated we focus here only on some major points which are of immediate relevance to the present
investigation. Section 3 contains a discussion of the results, i.e.
the magnetic ﬁeld dependent behaviour of the
exchange and correlation energies for the above-mentioned atomic and molecular two and three-electron systems.
Section 4 provides a summary and the conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL ASPECTS AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

Atoms and molecules in external magnetic ﬁelds show a number of intriguing new phenomena which are not
present in ﬁeld-free space and which manifest themselves already on the level of the fundamental equations of motion.
Examples are the inseparability of the center of mass and internal motion [2] and the screened Born-Oppenheimer
approach (see ref. [20] and references therein) which has to be followed in order to ensure the validity of an adiabatic
approximation for molecules in magnetic ﬁelds. In the present investigation which focuses on the ground states of
the corresponding systems in the ﬁeld strength regime 0 < B < 100a.u. (1a.u. corresponds to 2.35 · 105T esla) it
can be safely assumed that the ﬁxed-nucleus approach, i.e. the assumption of an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus, is a very
good zeroth order approximation to a more sophisticated electronic Hamiltonian. Therefore we arrive at the following
general appearance of the ﬁxed-nucleus Hamiltonian for the symmetric gauge using atomic units (m = |e| = ¯h = 1)

where we have assumed that the magnetic ﬁeld is oriented along the z−axis. ri, pi, Lzi are the position, canonical
momentum and canonical angular momentum component parallel to the ﬁeld of the i − th electron, respectively. V
contains all the Coulomb interaction terms, i.e. the electron-nucleus attraction as well as the electron-electron and
nucleus-nucleus (in the case of molecules) repulsion. In the case of an atom the symmetries of the above Hamiltonian
are: rotations around the magnetic ﬁeld axis, inversion of all coordinates with respect to the origin (position of the
i Lzi parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is conserved
nucleus). Consequently the total angular momentum component
(with the magnetic quantum number M ) and the parity and z−parity operator (with eigenvalue (−1)Πz ) commute
Πz of the
with H. Including the spin multiplicity 2S + 1 we therefore arrive at the spectroscopic notation ν2S+1M (−1)
electronic states in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld where ν designates the degree of excitation within a subspace of
certain symmetries. In the case of diatomic molecules the electronic energies depend in general on both the internuclear
distance as well as the angle Θ between the internuclear axis and the magnetic ﬁeld axis and the symmetries of the
electronic Hamiltonian depend strongly on the mutual orientation of these axes [21]. Within the present investigation
we restrict ourselves to the parallel conﬁguration (Θ = 0◦) of the hydrogen molecule which has been shown to be
of particular importance for the ground state of the diatomic system [21,16]. Choosing as the origin of the internal
coordinate system the midpoint between the positions of the identical nuclei we again have the parity, z−parity and
rotations around the magnetic ﬁeld axis as symmetries and use correspondingly the molecular spectroscopic notation
ν2S+1Mu/g where u/g denotes the ungerade-gerade parity, respectively, and M = 0, 1, 2, ... equals the series Σ, Π, ∆, ....
Solving the Schr¨odinger equation belonging to the Hamiltonian (1) in particular in the intermediate regime of ﬁeld
strengths poses a hard methodological and computational problem. This is due to the fact that the diamagnetic and
Coulomb interaction terms are of qualitatively diﬀerent nature and yield already on the one particle level (one-electron
atom or molecule) a nonseparable problem. Therefore the well-established methods for ab initio calculations of atoms
and molecules cannot be directly applied to electronic structure calculations in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Within
the present investigation we use two methods developed during the past years especially for the situation of strong
ﬁelds. They have been proven to be very accurate and eﬃcient for studies of electronic systems in external ﬁelds in
general. These are ﬁrst an unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) approach based on a numerical mesh method and second
a conﬁguration interaction approach based on a generalized anisotropic Gaussian basis set. Combining the results of

2

the corresponding calculations we will be able to extract the desired information on the behaviour of the exchange
and correlation energies for small atomic and molecular systems with changing ﬁeld strength. In the following we
provide some key ideas and features of the above-mentioned two methods. For further details and technical aspects
we refer the reader to the corresponding literature given below.

Our unrestricted HF approach is formulated in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z). We assign to each electron a certain
value of the magnetic quantum number mµ and each single-electron wave function Ψµ depends on the variables φ and
(ρ, z) according to

Ψµ(ρ, φ, z) = (2π)

−1/2e

−imµφψµ(z, ρ)

(2)

where µ indicates the numbering of the electrons. The resulting partial diﬀerential equations for ψµ(z, ρ) and the
formulae for the Coulomb and exchange potentials are given in ref. [7]. The one-particle equations for the wave
functions ψµ(z, ρ) are solved by means of the numerical mesh method described in refs. [22,7]. The feature which
distinguishes the present calculations from those described in ref. [7] is the computational technique for the evaluation
of the Coulomb and exchange integrals. Here as well as in ref. [23] we obtain these potentials as solutions of the
corresponding Poisson equations. The problem of the boundary conditions for the Poisson equation as well as the
problem of simultaneously solving Poissons equations and Schr¨odinger-like equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ)
on the same meshes have been discussed in ref. [7]. We solve these problems by using special forms of non-uniform
meshes. Solutions to the Poisson equation on separate meshes contain some errors δP associated with an inaccurate
description of the potential far from the nucleus. However due to the special form of the function δP (h) for these
meshes (where h is a formal mesh step) the errors do not show up in the ﬁnal results for the energy and other physical
quantities, which we obtain by means of the Richardson extrapolation procedure (polynomial extrapolation to h = 0
[22,24]). An additional improvement with respect to the precision of our numerical calculations of the integrals is
achieved by solving the Poisson equation not for the whole charge distribution but for the total distribution minus
some properly chosen charge distribution with known analytical solution to the Poisson equation.

Our mesh approach is ﬂexible enough to yield precise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. Some minor decrease of
the precision appears in very strong magnetic ﬁelds. This phenomenon is due to a growing diﬀerence in the binding
energies ǫB µ of single-electron wave functions belonging to the same electronic conﬁguration

ǫB µ = (mµ + |mµ| + 2szµ + 1)γ/2 − ǫµ

(3)

where ǫµ is the single-electron energy and szµ is the spin z-projection. This results in big diﬀerences with respect to
the spatial extension of the density distribution for diﬀerent electrons. The precision of our HF results depends, of
course, on the number of mesh nodes and can be improved in calculations with denser meshes. The absolute accuracy
of the total energies, i.e. the error within our HF mesh approach of the total energies, is typically of the order of
magnitude of 10−6, i.e they are very well converged.

Our second method for electronic structure calculations in strong magnetic ﬁelds is a conﬁguration interaction (CI)
approach based on an atomic basis set of generalized anisotropic Gaussian orbitals (GAGO). It has originally been
developed and implemented for molecules [25,15,16] and very recently has been specialized and optimized in order to
perform electronic structure calculations of atomic systems [8]. In contrast to the above HF-approach this method
is exact in the sense that it does not miss the correlation energy: increasing the number of basis functions allows, in
principle, for an arbitrary accurate description of the electronic wave functions. Together with the above HF-energies
this enables us to extract the behaviour of the correlation energy as a function of the ﬁeld strength.

In the remaining part of this section we brieﬂy describe the essential strategy of our GAGO based CI approach. For
the spatial part of the electronic eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (1) we use the linear combination of atomic orbitals
ansatz, i.e. we decompose the wave function into orbital conﬁgurations which respect the corresponding symmetries
and the Pauli principle. In the case of the hydrogen molecule H +
2 molecular orbital are formed as an intermediate
step. The H +
2 molecular orbitals are built from atomic orbitals centered at each nucleus. As already mentioned a key
ingredient of this procedure is the GAGO basis set. The individual orbitals have to be optimized in the presence of
a magnetic ﬁeld in order to ensure an eﬃcient and accurate description of the atomic or molecular properties. The
nonlinear optimization of the corresponding variational exponential parameters has to be performed for each state of
a given symmetry and for each ﬁeld strength separately and represents therefore a very extensive work. Finally in
order to determine the atomic or molecular electronic wave functions we use the variational principle which means we
solve the resulting generalized eigenvalue problem via standard methods. It is very well-known that describing the
correlation behaviour accurately is a very hard task to accomplish. Within the present approach the relative accuracy
of the total energies is estimated to be between 10−3 and 10−5 and the errors of the determined correlation energies
(using the corresponding HF results) are at most a few percent.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the present section we will ﬁrst focus on the behaviour of the exchange energies and subsequently correlation
energies as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength for atoms and thereafter for molecules. We will provide the
absolute values of these energies for a grid of values of the ﬁeld strength in the regime B = 0 − 100 and furthermore,
as an indicator of the relevance of these energies to the binding energies, we will show the ratios of these energies and
the total binding energies as a function of the ﬁeld strength.

Let us begin with the neutral two-electron atomic system, i.e.

the helium atom. Covering the regime of ﬁeld
strengths B = 0 − 100 the helium atom possesses ground states of diﬀerent symmetries. For the regime of ﬁeld
∼0.7 the ground state is the 110+ state which evolves continuously from the ground state in the
strengths 0 < B<
absence of a magnetic ﬁeld. At B ≈ 0.7 there occurs a crossover and the new ground state is of 13(−1)+ symmetry
which remains the ground state for the complementary regime B > 0.7, i.e. for arbitrary high magnetic ﬁeld strengths.
Since the spin singlet 110+ state possesses no exchange energy we are exclusively interested in the triplet state 13(−1)+.
Table I gives the absolute values of the exchange energy Eex of the 13(−1)+ state for twenty values of the ﬁeld strength
in the regime B = 0 − 100. We observe a monotonous increase from Eex = 0.00644 for B = 0 to Eex = 0.43872 for
B = 100 i.e. by approximately two orders of magnitude. This clearly demonstrates there is a strong increase in the
absolute value of the exchange energy with increasing ﬁeld strength. Since however the binding energy of the helium
atom in the 13(−1)+ state raises also with increasing ﬁeld strength we have to consider the ratio Rxb of the exchange
energy and the total binding energy in order to obtain an indicator for the inﬂuence of the exchange energy on the
binding properties of the atom with changing ﬁeld strength. This is illustrated in Figure 1 where the behaviour of Rxb
for the 13(−1)+ state of the helium atom is shown for 10−3 < B < 102 on a double logarithmic scale. Rxb increases
by more than one order of magnitude showing that the importance of the exchange energy for the binding properties
of the 13(−1)+ state of the atom increases with increasing ﬁeld strength.

What is the origin of this dramatic change in the exchange energy with increasing ﬁeld strength? To elucidate this
we have to take a step back and consider the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld. It is well-known that each of the lowest
electronic states of gerade z-parity and a given (negative) magnetic quantum number shows a monotonous increase in
binding energy with increasing ﬁeld strength [26]. These states uniquely correspond to the series of ﬁeld-free hydrogen
states 1s0, 2p−1, 3d−2, .... Indeed their binding energy diverges like EB → ∞ in the mathematical limit B → ∞. At
the same time the expectation value of the radius for these orbitals goes to zero, i.e. < r >→ 0. Moreover, the binding
energies of all these orbitals have small diﬀerences in the limit B → ∞. As a result their expectation values < r >
are also close together and this means that the electron densities corresponding to these orbitals are concentrated in
the same spatial region. On the other hand the binding energies and the spatial electron density distributions for
these states are very diﬀerent for B = 0. The 13(−1)+ state of helium consists, in the language of HF, of the 1s2p−1
orbitals constituting, according to the above, two strongly bound orbitals which shrink monotonically with increasing
ﬁeld strength. Comparing for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths the relative changes of < r > for the two orbitals 1s and 2p−1
it is obvious that they are much larger for the 2p−1 orbital. In the limit B → ∞ this orbital overlaps strongly with
the 1s orbital. This causes a strong increase in the overlap of the orbitals involved in the integral expression for
the exchange energy and thereby explains the above-observed increase of the exchange energy with increasing ﬁeld
strength.

Next let us consider the neutral three-electron atom, i.e. the lithium atom in a magnetic ﬁeld [12]. The ﬁeld-free
ground state possesses 20+ symmetry and, in a HF language, is represented by the spin dublet conﬁguration 1s22s.
The binding energy of this state increases monotonically with increasing ﬁeld strength. A careful investigation shows
[12] that there exist two crossovers with respect to the ground state of the Li atom with increasing ﬁeld strength
ﬁnally ending up in a spin quartett state. The ﬁrst crossover occurs at Bc1 = 0.176 up to which the 120+ remains
the global ground state. The new ground state above Bc1 is constituted by the 12(−1)+ state which, in the HF
picture, is represented by the spin dublet conﬁguration 1s22p−1. This ﬁrst change in the ground state is therefore not
associated with a spin ﬂip process but a pure change in the spatial orbitals: the weakly bound 2s orbital is replaced
by the strongly bound 2p−1 orbital. The 12(−1)+ spin dublet state is the global ground state of the Li atom in the
regime 0.176 < B < 2.153. At Bc2 = 2.153 a second crossover takes place and for B > Bc2 the new ground state is
represented by the fully spin polarized 14(−3)+ state which is constituted by the 1s2p−13d−2 orbital conﬁguration.
Table 1 provides the exchange energies of the above-mentioned ground states 120+, 12(−1)+ and 14(−3)+ of the
lithium atom, respectively, for the same grid of ﬁeld strengths used for the helium atom. Starting with a vanishing
ﬁeld strength the exchange energy for the ’weak-ﬁeld ground state’ 120+ ﬁrst increases with increasing ﬁeld strength
by approximately a factor two up to B ≈ 1 and subsequently decreases ﬁnally (B = 100) being lower than the
original ﬁeld-free value. A similar behaviour can be observed for the corresponding quantity Rxb(B) the drop after
the increase being however even larger since the total binding energy increases with increasing ﬁeld strength. The
exchange energies of the 12(−1)+ and 14(−3)+ states of the lithium atom increase monotonically with increasing ﬁeld

4

strength in the complete regime 0 < B < 100. The factor of increase is approximately 40 for the 14(−3)+ state and
even larger, i.e. 200, for the 12(−1)+ state. Analogously the quantity Rxb increases with increasing ﬁeld strength
for both states (see ﬁgure 1). The latter clearly indicates the increasing importance of the exchange energy for the
binding properties of the atom with increasing ﬁeld strength. The explanation provided above for the increase of the
exchange energy of the helium atom in a magnetic ﬁeld holds also for the 12(−1)+ and 14(−3)+ states of lithium.
The HF-orbitals responsible for the increase of the exchange energy are the 1s, 2p and 1s, 2p, 3d orbitals, respectively.
Obviously this argument does not hold for the 120+ state since the involved 2s HF-orbital shows no unrestricted
shrinking in size with increasing ﬁeld strength.

We now investigate the correlation energies for the ground states 110+ and 13(−1)+ of the helium atom. (Un-
fortunately there exists no approach currently which would allow to investigate the correlation energy of more than
two-electron systems in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld). The corresponding values are given in table 2 for
a grid of eleven ﬁeld strengths in the regime 0 < B < 100. Let us ﬁrst consider the ’weak-ﬁeld ground state’ 110+.
Its correlation energy stays approximately constant up to a ﬁeld strength of 2 and then increases only by a factor
of two while increasing the ﬁeld strength up to 100. Figure 2 shows the ratio Rcb of the correlation energy and the
corresponding total binding energy. Rcb stays approximately constant up to B = 0.1 and decreases thereafter which
indicates that the correlation energy becomes increasingly unimportant for the binding properties of the 110+ state
with increasing ﬁeld strength. If we focus on the correlation energies of the 13(−1)+ state of the helium atom we
observe (see table 2) a monotonous increase of roughly one order of magnitude for the whole regime B = 0 − 100.
Rcb for the 13(−1)+ state ﬁrst increases (see ﬁgure 2) with increasing ﬁeld strength up to B ≈ 1, then shows a minor
decrease and ﬁnally increases again for B>
∼ 10. The absolute values of the correlation energies of this state are, for
any ﬁeld strength, much smaller than the corresponding exchange energies. The observed relative changes of the
correlation energies with increasing ﬁeld strength are also signiﬁcantly smaller than those observed for the exchange
energies. One can therefore conclude that the importance of the correlation energy for the binding properties of the
’weak-ﬁeld ground state’ (110+) of helium decreases with increasing ﬁeld strength and that the exchange energy in
case of the ’high-ﬁeld ground state’ (13(−1)+) of helium becomes increasingly important for the binding properties
whereas its correlation energy shows only some minor ﬂuctuations.

We now turn to a discussion of the exchange and correlation energies for the ground states of the hydrogen molecule
in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld which is oriented parallel to the internuclear axis. Refs. [14–16] very recently clariﬁed
the question of the global ground states of the molecule for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. In ﬁeld free space the ground
state is well-bound and of 1Σ+
g symmetry, i.e. in particular a spin singlet state. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld
the spin-Zeeman shift lowers the total energy for triplet states with Ms = −1. As a result a ground state crossover
between the potential energy curves of the singlet 11Σg and triplet 13Σu state occurs at B ≈ 0.18. For Bc1 > 0.18
the minimum of the potential energy curve of the 11Σg state lies higher in energy than the dissociation limit of the
essentially repulsive (see below) potential energy curve of the 13Σu state. The latter represents therefore the global
ground state of the hydrogen molecule if we increase the ﬁeld strength beyond Bc1. The potential energy curve of
the 13Σu state is a predominantly repulsive curve for any ﬁeld strength. Only for B<
∼1.0 it exhibits a shallow outer
van der Waals well whose depth is of the order to 10−5 and contains no vibrational levels. The hydrogen molecule is
therefore unstable in the regime of ﬁeld strengths Bc1 < B < Bc2 where Bc2 = 12.3 is the ﬁeld strength for which a
second crossover takes place. The new ground state above Bc2 is the state 13Πu which is a strongly bound state with
a monotonically increasing binding energy with increasing ﬁeld strength.

Due to antiparallel spins the ’weak-ﬁeld ground state’ 11Σg possesses a vanishing exchange energy. The 13Σu state
is also of little interest since it exhibits only a very shallow outer well and does not correspond to a physically bound
state. Nevertheless we have provided in table 3 the positions of the outer minimum as well as the exchange energies
for the 13Σu state for ﬁeld strengths B ≤ 1.0. The observed changes in the exchange energy are very minor though the
absolute values are pretty large. The latter fact has its origin in the exchange eﬀects occuring because the inner part
of the wave function is very similar to the corresponding wave function of the hydrogen molecular ion which is very
diﬀerent from the dissociative wave function of separate atoms. Of much more interest is the ’high-ﬁeld ground state’
13Πu whose equilibrium internuclear distances and exchange energies are given in table 3. Req decreases whereas the
exchange energy increases by a factor of 20 with increasing ﬁeld strength B = 0 − 100. Figure 3 shows the quantity
Rxb for the 13Πu state. It is almost constant for 10−3 < B < 10−1 and increases then approximately by a factor
of two within the next two orders of magnitude of the ﬁeld strength. Thereafter, i.e.
∼10.0, it shows only a
minor decrease. The origin of this observed increase of the exchange energy of the 13Πu state is very similar to the
one observed for the ’high ﬁeld ground states’ of helium and lithium. In a HF-picture the 13Πu state is described
by the united-atom orbitals 1s2p−1 which show a monotonically increasing binding energy and decreasing size with
increasing ﬁeld strength. Consequently the size of the molecule decreases also and its exchange energy increases due
to the increasing overlap of the orbitals (see above). We remark that showing instead of the quantity Rxb(B) the
ratio Rxd(B) of the exchange energy and the dissociation energy for the 13Πu state would have resulted ﬁrst in a
moderate increase (factor of 2.5) with increasing ﬁeld strength with a maximum at approximately B ≈ 2.0 followed

for B>

5

by a moderate decrease with further increasing strength of the ﬁeld.

Finally we turn to a discussion of the correlation energies of the three states involved in the ground states of the
hydrogen molecule in a magnetic ﬁeld. For the ’weak-ﬁeld ground state’ 11Σg the correlation energy increases by
approximately a factor of three with increasing ﬁeld strength B = 0 − 100. Figure 4 shows the corresponding ratio
Rcb(B) which is almost constant in the regime 10−3 < B < 10−1 and then decreases monotonically with increasing ﬁeld
strength. The corresponding quantity Rcd(B) which describes the ratio of the correlation energy and the dissociation
energy shows a very similar behaviour. The 13Σu state shows, according to table 4, an extremely small contribution
of the correlation energy which is almost of the same size as our computational error. More interesting is again the
correlation energy of the 13Πu state which decreases (see table 4) monotonically by one order of magnitude in the
complete range B = 0 − 100. Apart from some small amplitude oscillations the corresponding quantity Rcb(B) is
constant. Again the ratio Rcd(B) shows a similar behaviour, i.e. is also approximately constant.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the behaviour of the exchange and correlation energies for small atoms and molecules in
magnetic ﬁelds covering the regime B = 0 − 100. To get the exchange energies Hartree-Fock calculations have been
performed for the helium and lithium atoms and for the hydrogen molecule using a ﬂexible mesh approach in order
to adapt to the changing symmetries in the presence of the external ﬁeld. To extract the correlation energies we
used a conﬁguration interaction approach which is based on an anisotropic generalized Gaussian basis set particularly
developed for the needs in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Correlation energies have been determined for the helium atom
and the hydrogen molecule.

The overall tendency of the exchange energy with increasing ﬁeld strength is twofold. If less than two orbitals
with parallel spins of the hydrogenic series 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, ... are involved in the Hartree-Fock wave function then
it can be expected that the exchange energy does not increase signiﬁcantly with increasing ﬁeld strength and its
relevance with respect to the binding energy can be expected to decrease. An example for this situation is given by
the ground state of the lithium atom for weak magnetic ﬁelds, i.e. the 120+ state which is constituted by the 1s22s
HF-conﬁguration. In ref. [12] it has been shown that, with increasing ﬁeld strength, the HF-conﬁgurations of the
global ground states of an atom show an increasing degree of spin polarization and, more important, involve more
and more of the orbitals belonging to the tightly bound hydrogenic orbitals 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, .... The generic behaviour
of the exchange energy is then given by a monotonous, in many cases strong, increase with increasing ﬁeld strength.
In fact the exchange energy increases for a typical case even faster than the binding energy and becomes therefore
increasingly relevant for the binding properties of the atom. Examples for this behaviour are given by the 13(−1)+
state of helium constituted by the 1s2p−1 HF-conﬁguration and the 12(−1)+ and 14(−3)+ states of lithium which
correspond to the HF-conﬁgurations 1s22p−1 and 1s2p−13d−2, respectively. For the hydrogen molecule the strongly
bound ground state in the high-ﬁeld regime, i.e. the 13Πu state, shows such a behaviour, although it is not as well
pronounced as in the case of the above-mentioned states of helium and lithium.

So far we have summarized only the behaviour of the exchange energy for a given electronic state. However, to
get the complete picture one should take into account also the fact that the ground state changes its symmetry with
changing ﬁeld strength. The magnetic ﬁeld increasingly spin-polarizes atoms and molecules with increasing magnetic
ﬁeld strength, i.e. there occurs a series of ground state crossovers which are due to spin ﬂip transitions (note that
these are not the only ground state crossovers which actually occur but we have also crossovers without spin ﬂip
transitions like for example the 120+ → 12(−1)+ crossover in the case of the lithium atom). With each of those
spin-ﬂip transitions the number of unpaired electrons of the global ground state increases and gives a good chance to
increase the corresponding exchange energy of the global ground state in an abrupt way. This mechanism adds to
the increasing importance of the exchange energy for a given electronic state of a certain symmetry with increasing
ﬁeld strength. In total one can therefore make the general statement that with increasing ﬁeld strength the exchange
energy becomes increasingly relevant for the binding properties of atoms and molecules.

For the correlation energy the situation is very diﬀerent, indeed, it is in a sense almost the opposite. Let us ﬁrst
discuss again the behaviour for an electronic ground state of a given symmetry. The absolute value of the correlation
energy increases in most cases with increasing ﬁeld strength B = 0 − 100 only by a minor factor 1 − 10 which is
much less than the corresponding increase in exchange energy (c.f.
the ground states of helium or the hydrogen
molecule). Consequently, since in most cases the binding energy increases with increasing ﬁeld strength, the ratio
of the correlation energy and the total binding energy decreases or stays approximately constant. This means that
the correlation energy becomes either increasingly irrelevant or at least does not become more relevant if we turn
on a stronger and stronger magnetic ﬁeld. If we consider now the sequence of global ground states with diﬀerent
symmetries which occurs with increasing ﬁeld strength then the absolute value of the correlation energy drops at

6

each crossover which involves more of the tightly bound orbitals of the hydrogenic series 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, .... This
feature adds to the decreasing importance of the correlation energy for a given electronic ground state with a certain
symmetry and increasing ﬁeld strength. One can therefore conclude that with increasing ﬁeld strength the correlation
energy becomes increasingly irrelevant for the binding properties of atoms and molecules.

It is evident that there might be exceptions to the above-drawn picture which is concluded from the few data
available on small atoms and molecules. Further investigations have to conﬁrm and/or extend these conclusions.
However this would take a considerable eﬀort in particular with respect to the development of exact methods for more
than two-electron systems which are currently not available.

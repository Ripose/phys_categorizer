Two–Loop Bethe Logarithms for non-S Levels

Two-loop Bethe logarithms are calculated for excited P and D states in hydrogenlike systems, and estimates
are presented for all states with higher angular momenta. These results complete our knowledge of the P and D
energy levels in hydrogen at the order of α8 me c2, where me is the electron mass and c is the speed of light, and
scale as Z6, where Z is the nuclear charge number. Our analytic and numerical calculations are consistent with
the complete absence of logarithmic terms of order (α/π)2 (Zα)6 ln[(Zα)−2] me c2 for D states and all states
with higher angular momenta. For higher excited P and D states, a number of poles from lower-lying levels
have to subtracted in the numerical evaluation. We ﬁnd that, surprisingly, the corrections of the “squared decay-
rate type” are the numerically dominant contributions in the order (α/π)2 (Zα)6 me c2 for states with large
angular momenta, and provide an estimate of the entire B60-coefﬁcient for Rydberg states with high angular
momentum quantum numbers. Our results reach the predictive limits of the quantum electrodynamic theory of
the Lamb shift.

INTRODUCTION

The two-loop Bethe logarithm stems from a nonrelativistic
treatment of the full two-loop self-energy. It is the ﬁnite part
which is left over when the two-loop problem is renormal-
ized according to the original derivation of Bethe [1] for the
one-loop self-energy and therefore represents a natural gener-
alization of the most basic quantum electrodynamic calcula-
tion to the two-loop level, yet the respective calculation is the
only way to complete the analysis of hydrogenic energy levels
in the order (α/π)2 (Zα)6me c2. In comparison to the one-
loop problem, the two-loop nonrelativistic self-energy is much
more complicated, and it involves three instead of one propa-
gator denominators. Matrix elements cannot be expressed in
closed analytic form. Numerical methods, inspired by lattice
calculations, represent convenient tools for the evaluations.

Final calculations were carried out on workstation clusters
of the Max–Planck–Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidel-
berg and of the National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy. The total CPU time of all computations required for the
present paper was about 30 months, but the real time was of
course drastically shortened due to parallel processing. The
two-loop problem is known to be computationally demanding.
Additional difﬁculties arise for excited states due to a number
of poles from lower-lying levels which have to be subtracted
in the numerical evaluation. After subtraction, the result is ﬁ-
nite, as it should be, and represents an observable energy shift.
The problem of so-called squared decay rates is associated
with the two-loop Bethe logarithm [2]. The squared decay
rates, which originate from speciﬁc photon energies where
two propagators become singular simultaneously, cannot be
uniquely interpreted as energy corrections even if the concept
of a pole on the second sheet of the Riemann surface deﬁn-
ing the propagator is used in order to deﬁne energy levels,
and have been assigned [2] to an contribution δB60, where
B60 is the two-loop coefﬁcient multiplying the scaling fac-
tor of (α/π)2 (Zα)6mec2/n3 (here, n is the principal quan-
tum number). For 3P and 4P states, the squared decay rates
were originally evaluated in in Ref. [2]. In [3], an analysis of

S states was supplemented, and it has been clariﬁed that the
contributions as given in [2] should be understood in radians
per second rather than cycles per second, or Hz. Here, we sup-
ply numerical values for the correction of the “squared-decay”
type for excited S, P , D, F , G and H states, and we also dis-
cuss approximations for general states. The squared decay
rates are a manifestation of the fact that a proper deﬁnition of
energy levels ceases to be possible at the level of α2(Zα)6 in
units of the electron mass, as already pointed out in Ref. [4].
Yet, these contributions are mathematically well deﬁned and
have to be evaluated in a calculation whose aim is to explore
the predictive limits of the quantum electrodynamic theory of
hydrogenlike systems.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we summa-
rize all known results for the two-loop energy shift of excited
P and D states up to the order α (Zα)6 (all energy shifts are
measured in units of me c2 in this paper unless stated other-
wise). Important deﬁnitions and formulas regarding the two-
loop Bethe logarithm are recalled in Sec. III. The asymptotics
of the two-loop integrand and the calculation of the two-loop
Bethe logarithm are discussed in Sec. IV. The squared decay
rates, which are numerically signiﬁcant especially for states
with higher angular momenta, are treated in Sec. V. Miscel-
laneous two-loop results are compiled in Appendixes A—C.
One-photon vacuum-polarization and self-energy shifts of or-
der α(Zα)7 are discussed in Appendix D.

II. KNOWN TWO–LOOP RESULTS

We work in natural units (¯h = c = ǫ0 = 1), as is customary
in QED bound-state calculations, and we also set the electron
mass equal to unity in the following. The real part of the en-
ergy displacement of a hydrogenic state due to the two-loop
(2L) self-energy (SE) can be parameterized as follows,

∆E(2L)

SE =

π

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where H is a dimensionless function. Here, we are concerned
with P and D states, and in part with states of higher angular
momenta. For these manifolds, the ﬁrst nonvanishing terms
in the semi-analytic expansion of the dimensionless function
H(Zα) in powers for Zα and ln(Zα) read as follows,

j + 1
where κ = (−1)j+l+1/2
is the Dirac angular quan-
2
tum number (l is the orbital angular momentum quantum
number, and j denotes the total angular momentum of the
electron). In this way, one immediately reproduces the well-
known general result

(cid:27)

The ﬁrst index of the B-coefﬁcients denotes the power of Zα
including the factors Zα contained in Eq. (1), and the second
index denotes the power of ln[(Zα)−2]. For the lowest-order
B40 term, a complete result is known which is valid for any
hydrogenic state (see, e.g., Ref. [5]). We here express the re-
sult in terms of the expectation value of an operator, as in
Eq. (8.1) of Ref. [6], and suppress all operators which are zero
for P states and states with higher angular momenta,

which is valid for all non-S hydrogenic states.

Our goal here is to extend formula (4) to two relative orders
of Zα, for general P and D states, and to ﬁnd estimates for
general states with higher angular momenta. In Ref. [6], nu-
merical results have only been indicated for the ﬁne-structure
difference of D states [see Eqs. (4.22) and (5.3) of Ref. [6]]
and for P states [see Eqs. (4.24) and (5.4), (6.2) and (7.7) of
Ref. [6]]. However, the complete result for B60 entails the
two-loop Bethe logarithm, which has not been known so far.

We recall that in terms of matrix elements, to be evaluated
on Pauli–Schr¨odinger nonrelativistic wave functions of non-S
hydrogenic states, the higher-order terms B62, B61 and B60
can be expressed as follows (see Ref. [6]),

We take the opportunity to point out that in the corresponding
Eq. (8.1) of Ref. [6], a prefactor of (α/π)2 in front of the sec-
ond term on the right-hand side was missing [in Ref. [6], the
entire above result (5) for the energy shift was multiplied by
a factor of (α/π)2 on the left and right-hand side]. Also, the
square of the logarithm ln2
1
in the second and in
the last-but-one term on the right-hand side were not included.
Both typographical errors are absent from Eq. (8) of previous
work reported in Ref. [7] and from the above Eq. (5).

We recall here the deﬁnitions of the quantities N , β4 and

in accordance with the notation introduced in [7], we redeﬁne
the ﬁnite part of an integral which diverges as

Λ

dk f (k) = A λ + B ln λ + C + O(λ−1) ,

(6a)

with λ ≡ Λ (Z α)−2, for a speciﬁed upper cutoff Λ, to be

The N term has previously been deﬁned in Refs. [8, 9]; it is
generated by a Dirac delta correction to the Bethe logarithm.
The notation δV is used in accordance with Ref. [6, 8] in order
to denote the ﬁrst-order perturbation of the Hamiltonian, the
energy and the wave function in the ensuing matrix element,
due to the speciﬁed potential V .

(cid:29)

The evaluation of the two-loop Bethe logarithm for 1S and
2S has been discussed in Ref. [9], and for 3S–6S in Ref. [3].
For 1S and 2S, there is no ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the
Bethe logarithm, because the integration over both photon en-
ergies in the nonrelativistic self-energy is free of singulari-
ties. However, for all higher excited S states and all states
considered here, one incurs real (rather than imaginary) con-
tributions to the energy shift from the product of imaginary
contributions due to singularities along both photon integra-
tions, and these result in “squared decay rates” in the sense of
Ref. [2]. Thus, it is helpful to make a clear distinction between
the singularity-free, principal-value part bL and a real part
δ2B60, which is incurred by “squared” (or, more precisely,
products of) imaginary contributions from the pole terms. We
write

bL = bL + δ2B60 ,

(8)

where bL is obtained as the nonlogarithmic energy shift stem-
ming from the nonrelativistic self-energy, with all integrations

3

carried out by principal value, and δ2B60 is the corresponding
contribution deﬁned in Refs. [2, 3], due to squared imaginary
parts. The exact meaning of the separation (8) will be clari-
ﬁed below. Here, we just note that for 3S–6S states, the above
separation is not really essential, because δ2B60 is a numeri-
cally marginal contribution as compared to bL (see Ref. [3]),
and thus bL(nS) ≈ bL(nS) to a very good approximation.
For the states under investigation here, the distinction (8), sur-
prisingly, proves to be highly essential; yet before we come to
a discussion of this surprising phenomenon, let us ﬁrst discuss
the evaluation of bL.

III. TWO–LOOP BETHE LOGARITHM

We brieﬂy recall [3, 9] the nonrelativistic two-photon self-

energy ∆ENRQED as an integral of the following structure,

(cid:18)

∆ENRQED =

(cid:19)

(9)
where the k1 and k2 represent photon energies, and ǫ1 as well
as ǫ2 are cutoff parameters. The function f (k1, k2) is deﬁned
in Eq. (11) below; its precise structure is unimportant for the
following consideration, which concerns the relation of the
cutoff parameters ǫi (i = 1, 2) to the ultraviolet cutoff Λ pa-
rameter used in Eqs. (6)—(7).

In order to clarify this relation, we recall that in the con-
text of the ǫ method (see §123 of Ref. [10] and [11–13]),
the cutoff parameters are chosen so that the ǫ can be made
arbitrarily small, but only under the condition Zα ≪ ǫ, so
that the expansion, ﬁrst carried out in Zα, then in ǫ, for the
low- as well as the high-energy parts, gives the complete re-
sult for the self-energy. This procedure has been fully clari-
ﬁed in §123 of Ref. [10] and in Refs. [11–14]. In Ref. [14],
it has been stressed that this method actually corresponds to
an expansion in large ǫ, and indeed, in the context of the di-
mensional regularization method [6], the nonlogarithmic term
which remains after subtraction of the divergent contributions
as ǫ1 = Λ1 → ∞, ǫ2 = Λ2 → ∞, has been been identiﬁed
as the two-loop Bethe logarithm bL. Because we are dealing
here with excited states that can decay via dipole radiation,
care must be taken in the deﬁnition of the integration prescrip-
tion for the k1 and k2 integrations. In the current section, we
ﬁrst assume a principal-value prescription and write

(Zα)6

Λ1

Z

(P.V.)

dk1k1(P.V.)

dk2k2f (k1, k2),

Λ2

Z

(10)

where (P.V.) denotes the principal value, and it is understood
that divergent terms for large Λ1 and Λ2 have to be subtracted,
in the sense of Eq. (6).

The subtractions for large Λi (i = 1, 2) are carried out as-
suming Λ1 ≪ Λ2, so we ﬁrst let Λ2 → ∞, extract the con-
stant term as a function of k1 and then we integrate this term
with respect to k1, letting Λ1 → ∞. In this way we “sweep”

4

(cid:29)

(11)

the entire ﬁrst quadrant of the two-dimensional (k1, k2) plane
(i.e., the entire region k1 > 0, k2 > 0). Of course, the same
result would be obtained for the constant term under the op-

posite sequence of ﬁrst letting Λ1 approach inﬁnity, then Λ2.
We are now in the position to recall the explicit form of

The interpretation of the terms on the right-hand side is as
follows: the ﬁrst six are due to fourth-order perturbation the-
ory generated by the “velocity-gauge” nonrelativistic (~p · ~A)-
interaction. Herein, the ﬁfth and the sixth terms are derivative
terms which naturally occur in fourth-order perturbation the-
ory. The seventh term involves (on the left and on the right)
(~p · ~A)-interactions, and a seagull term proportional to ~A2 in
between. The eighth and ninth terms involve a seagull term
outside of the (~p · ~A)-interactions. We also recall that the scal-
ing of f (k1, k2) with Zα is completely clariﬁed in Ref. [3].

IV. ASYMPTOTICS OF THE INTEGRAND

We ﬁrst consider the asymptotics relevant for the initial k2

integration in Eq. (10). In the limit k2 ≫ k1, we ﬁnd

The second term vanishes for D states and all states with
higher angular momenta. Subtracting the two above terms ac-
cording to the deﬁnition (6) [a practical procedure is outlined
in Eq. (26) of Ref. [3]], we obtain

g(k1) = (P.V.)

a result which is valid only for non-S states. The N term,
which is deﬁned in Eq. (7), remains important for the P state
calculation, but vanishes for D states and all states of higher
angular momenta.

In the actual calculations, we use a lattice formulation of
the Schr¨odinger propagator [15] with up to 200 000 lattice
sites. This provides sufﬁcient accuracy (and computational
efﬁciency) for all calculations reported here and is feasible on
average-size workstation clusters.

It is computationally advantageous to isolate the contribu-
tion to bL due to the fourth term on the right-hand side of
Eq. (8), in order to avoid numerical problems associated with
the calculation of the reduced Green function. This contri-
bution reads, after the k1 and k2-integrations and appropriate
subtractions,

where φ is the reference state. The calculation of this contri-
bution is done separately, by writing it in terms of a sum over
virtual states, which are calculated as a basis set on a lattice in
coordinate space. Numerical values are compiled in Table I,
where the name “loop-after-loop” should be taken cum grano

salis because the negative-energy virtual states are excluded
from expression (16). The ﬁnal results for bL are in Table II.
Based on the trend of the data in Table II, we conjecture
here that in the limit n → ∞, the two-loop Bethe logarithms
for a given l should approach a constant in the same way as the
one-loop Bethe logarithms [16–18]. Also, the data in Table II
indicate that the two-loop Bethe logarithms, just like their
one-loop counterparts, become smaller in magnitude for in-
creasing orbital angular momentum. Indeed, they do so quite
drastically, with the D-state values being almost two orders
of magnitude smaller than the P -state logarithms. The mag-
nitude of the S-state logarithms [3], in turn, is in the range of
60 . . . 80 and thus larger than the P -state values by more than
one order of magnitude.

V. SQUARED DECAY RATES

5

As clariﬁed in Ref. [2] and Sec. IV of Ref. [3], squared de-
cay rates represent natural limits to which energy levels can
be uniquely associated with a particular atomic level. Cor-
rections of this type have been analyzed for 2P and 3P in
Ref. [2], and for 3S and 4S in Ref. [3]. Here, we supplement
values for 5P and 6P , as well as all other states with n ≤ 6.
Some inaccuracies in previous treatments for S and P states
are corrected in Table III, and a more extensive list of levels is
covered.

According to Refs. [2, 3], the term δ2B60 is generated by
“squared decay rates,” which correspond to well-deﬁned, iso-
lated points of the (k1, k2)-photon energy plane, where two
propagators become singular simultaneously in the integrand
of the two-loop Bethe logarithm given in Eq. (11). These are
all points where, for a given principal quantum number n of
the reference state, any two of the following conditions are
satisﬁed simultaneously,

quencies which give rise to the singularities are smaller than

One might ask why the result on the right-hand side reads
−π2, not −(2π)2. The answer is that both the k1 and the k2
integration contours have to be deformed along half circles,
centered at the location of the singularities, inﬁnitesimally be-
low the real axis, i.e. in the mathematically positive sense.
This half circle entails a factor πi, whose square gives the re-
sults on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (20a)—(20d).

k2 in Eq. (11), according to the prescription (20). The con-
tributions δ2B60 is thus mathematically well-deﬁned and, in
particular, has an unambiguously deﬁned sign for each indi-
vidual state.

A very curious observation can be made regarding the
order-of-magnitude of bL versus that of δ2B60 for different
manifolds of hydrogenic states. For S and P states, we have
|δ2B60| ≪ |bL|, as is evident from Table II of this work and
from Table II of Ref. [3]. For the 1S and the 2S states consid-
ered in Ref. [9], we even have δ2B60(1S) = δ2B60(2S) =
0. For higher excited S states, the magnitude of δ2B60 is
smaller than the magnitude of the current numerical uncer-
tainty of bL incurred by the numerical integration described in
Ref. [3], and thus, δ2B60 can at present be completely ignored
for S states. Therefore, the question of whether to include
δ2B60 into the canonical deﬁnition of bL had been ignored in
Refs. [3, 9] for the simple reasons that δ2B60(nS) was either
vanishing or found to be a numerically negligible. Initially
(see Ref. [2]), the notation δ2B60 was chosen such as to make
an association with a small “uncertainty” in the deﬁnition of
bL. However, the situation changes drastically for P states,
where |δ2B60| ≈ 0.1 |bL| for n ≥ 3, and even more drasti-
cally for D states, where |δ2B60| ≫ |bL| for all n, revers-
ing the hierarchy of the “uncertainty” δ2B60 and the two-loop
Bethe logarithm bL (the latter would otherwise be assumed to
constitute the dominant effect).
In view of this situation,

the pressing question arises
whether or not one should include δ2B60(nS) into the deﬁ-

6

nition of the two-loop Bethe logarithm for states with higher
angular momenta. One might argue that δ2B60(nS) should be
excluded from the deﬁnition of the two-loop Bethe logarithm
bL because, as shown in Ref. [2], the term cannot be uniquely
interpreted as an energy shift associated with a speciﬁc atomic
level. On the other hand, one might argue that δ2B60(nS)
should be included into the deﬁnition of the two-loop Bethe
logarithm bL for higher excited states, because it is generated
by the product of two imaginary energy shifts, both of which
originate from the same nonrelativistic two-loop self-energy
(9), which otherwise gives rise to the low-energy contribution
to the B60 coefﬁcient. We reemphasize that the δ2B60-term
has an unambiguously deﬁned sign for each individual state
and is important for the comparison of our analytic approach
to B60 to any nonperturbative (in Zα) numerical calculation
of the two-loop energy shift for the listed excited hydrogenic
states, as well as for the comparison of theory and experiment
based on a line-shape formalism [4]. Nonperturbative calcula-
tions of the two-loop self-energy have recently been pursued
intensively [19–25].

In the current investigation, we would like to follow the sec-
ond route and deﬁne [see Eq. (8)] bL = bL + δ2B60, where
bL is obtained by performing all integrations in Eq. (10) via a
principal-value prescription, with the results listed in Table II,
and δ2B60 contains all the terms generated by the products of
imaginary parts incurred at poles in the (k1, k2)-plane. This
deﬁnition has the following advantages: (i) When the deﬁni-
tion (8) is adopted, the term bL in the result for the B60 coef-
ﬁcient as given in Eq. (8.1) of Ref. [6] contains all real (rather
than imaginary) terms which can be inferred from the nonrel-
ativistic self-energy given in Eq. (16) of Ref. [8] and Eq. (5)
of Ref. [9] upon contour integration over both photon ener-
gies. (ii) In nonperturbative numerical evaluations of radia-
tive two-loop energy shifts for excited states, one would “pick
up” terms of the type δ2B60 naturally if one deforms both
photon energy integration contours according to the Feynman
prescription near adjacent bound-state poles. The deﬁnition
(8) makes possible a direct comparison of nonperturbative
numerical results obtained in this way, to the results for bL
and B60 given here, without the need for any subtraction of
the squared imaginary parts. (iii) For D states, the deﬁnition
(8) includes the numerically most signiﬁcant real (rather than
imaginary) contribution which can be inferred from the non-
relativistic two-loop self-energy (9) into bL and thus into the
B60 coefﬁcient.

Despite these advantages of the proposed deﬁnition (8), one
should remember that the term δ2B60 cannot be interpreted as
an energy shift uniquely associated with a particular atomic
level, and has to be treated differently, namely according to
ideas outlined in Sec. 3 of Ref. [2] when in a comparison to
experiments. According to the discussion in the cited refer-
ence, a valid way of treating (part of) δ2B60 would ﬁrst entail
a subtraction of this term from from the energy shift, and then,
a reinterpretation of it in terms of an off-diagonal “decay rate
operator” which has to be included into a line-shape formal-
ism.

We see that the total value of B60 is the sum of high-energy operators given by inverse powers of the principal quantum number,
linear combinations of terms proportional to ln(2) and ζ functions of various arguments, and low-energy terms β4 and β5 which
are known from one-loop calculations [28, 29] (see also Tables VII and VIII below), as well as the two-loop Bethe logarithm bL.
For D states, it is known that B62(nD) = B61(nD) = 0. Indeed, the fact that N (nD) = 0 for D states implies that the
term of order 1/k1 in the asymptotics (15) vanishes, and this is consistent with the zero result for B61(nD). The nonlogarithmic

For F states, the values of B60 are displayed in Table VI (de-
tailed formulas are given in Appendix C). We observe that the
total value of B60 for F states is numerically rather close to
the value of δ2B60 for each state as given in Table II. Con-
tributions from the ﬁne-structure dependent terms as well as
those from the high-energy operators gradually vanish as the
angular momentum increases, and the dominant remaining
contribution then stems from δ2B60.

For G and H states, the total value of B60 is the same as
the value of δ2B60 up to the level of ±1.0 × 10−3 in units of
B60, as shown in Tables III and VI. We may now use our ex-
perience regarding the asymptotic behavior of one-loop Bethe
logarithms [18] and of relativistic Bethe logarithms [29], and
based on the data in Tables IV, V and Table VI for an extrapo-
lation of B60 to an arbitrary state. Speciﬁcally, we conjecture
that for a given hydrogenic energy level which reads nLj in
the usual spectroscopic notation,

B60(nLj) ≈ δ2B60 ≈

for L ≥ 3, and both j = L ± 1/2 .

(24)

This conjecture implies that the dominant contribution to B60
comes from the squared decay rates, i.e. from the term δ2B60,
and the conjecture (24) can be used to estimate this coefﬁcient
for an arbitrary Rydberg state of high angular momentum.

TABLE VI: Same as Tables IV and V, but for F , G and H states.
For these states, the total values of B60 are close to the numerical
values for δ2B60 as listed in Table III, and the high-energy operators
as well as the ﬁne-structure dependent corrections do not introduce
any signiﬁcant numerical deviation of the total value of B60 from
δ2B60.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Together with the one-loop results from Appendix D, the
reported calculation of the two-loop nonlogarithmic term of
order (α/π)2 (Zα)2 me c2 completes the analysis of the quan-
tum electrodynamic corrections to non-S states in the order
α8 me c2 for hydrogen (Z = 1). Together with other recent
theoretical investigations [6, 7], the current work clariﬁes fur-
ther prerequisites and the theoretical basis for the determina-
tion of fundamental constants from hydrogen spectroscopy at
the level of one part in 1014. For ionized helium, the correc-
tions calculated here are enhanced by a factor of 26 = 64 in
frequency units. The numerical values of principal-value two-
loop Bethe logarithms bL are given in Table II, and squared
decay rates δ2B60 are indicated in Table III. Final numeri-
cal results for B60, which is the sum of bL, δ2B60 and high-

energy operators as well as ﬁne-structure dependent terms
[see Eqs. (22a)—(23b)], are given in Tables IV, V and VI. Our
total results for B60 contain the sum of the contributions from
all four gauge-invariant subsets as shown in Fig. 2. We con-
ﬁrm that the trend already observed in the literature [17, 18]
for one-loop Bethe logarithms which decrease in magnitude
with increasing orbital angular momentum quantum number,
also holds for the two-loop counterparts. Finally, a com-
parison of our results with a very recent numerical inves-
tigation [25] indicates that our results for B60(2P1/2) and
B60(2P3/2) for subset i (see Fig. 2 and Tables VII and VIII
below) are consistent with a nonperturbative (in Zα) treat-
ment of the two-loop self-energy, which forms subset i in the
classiﬁcation of Fig. 2.

our calculation explores the predictive limits of quantum elec-
trodynamic theory of energy levels of the hydrogen atom and
hydrogenlike systems. Explicit theoretical values of the Lamb
shift for selected states in hydrogenlike ions will be presented
elsewhere.

All calculations reported here (see in particular Tables II
and III) were carried out on an average-size cluster of work-
stations. A ﬁfth-order ﬁnite-difference scheme was used in or-
der to accurately describe the behavior of the S component of
the propagators on a grid near the origin, and in order to allow
for a fast calculation of the two-loop integrand on the work-
station cluster of Max–Planck–Institute for Nuclear Physics
in Heidelberg and of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. However, even the most sophisticated computer
hardware and numerical algorithms would be useless in the
current context unless combined with a thorough formulation
of the subtraction procedures necessary to extract the physi-
cally observable energy corrections and frequency shifts.

low the classiﬁcation of diagrams according to Ref. [6]). Our results
for B60 contain contributions from all of these diagrams; the sepa-
ration into the four subsets is only relevant for the detailed formulas
given in the Appendixes.

The connection of the two-loop problem to squared decay
rates has been analyzed previously in Refs. [2, 3]. For the
atomic levels under investigation, we give a respective treat-
ment in Sec. V. The contributions to B60 in Table III due
to squared imaginary parts cannot be interpreted as energy
shifts in the usual sense and set a limit to the actual “deﬁn-
ability” of the atomic energy levels under investigation. The
surprising conclusion of the current investigation is that the
squared decay rates actually give the dominant contribution to
B60 for states with higher angular momenta (see Tables II, III
and VI). As δ2B60 cannot be associated uniquely as an en-
ergy correction to one speciﬁc atomic level, we conclude that

APPENDIX A: MISCELLANEOUS RESULTS FOR P
STATES

In Sec. VI, we had discussed the evaluation of the total B60
coefﬁcient for P1/2 and P3/2 states of general n. Here, we
would like to supplement the results for the individual sub-
sets i–iv of the two-loop diagrams as given in Figs. 1–4 of
Ref. [6] and in Fig. 2 here. The results presented in this Ap-
pendix might be helpful both for a comparison of our analytic
to nonperturbative numerical results, as well as for a veriﬁca-
tion of alternative, independent analytic calculations for par-
ticular sets of diagrams.

We start with the subset i (pure two-loop self-energy) for

P1/2 states (see Fig. 2),

TABLE VII: Breakdown of the individual contributions to B60(nP1/2) from all diagrammatic subsets as de-
ﬁned in Ref. [6]. The numerical uncertainty in Bi
60(nP1/2) is entirely due to the two-loop Bethe logarithm
given in Table II. The N term has been calculated in Ref. [28]; it is spin-independent and therefore indicated
only for the P1/2 states (cf. Table VIII below).

We also note that in Eqs. (5.4), (6.2) and (7.7) of Ref. [6], results for the ﬁne-structure difference associated with the diagrams
of subsets ii–iv were indicated. We reemphasize that these results are valid only for the ﬁne-structure difference of P states.
Therefore, we would like to supplement the individual contributions for P1/2 and P3/2 here, starting with P1/2,

APPENDIX D: VACUUM POLARIZATION AND SELF

ENERGY SHIFTS OF ORDER α (Zα)

An investigation of the behavior of the wave functions near
the nucleus, inspired by Ref. [33], leads to the following cor-
rection terms of order α(Zα)7,

As is well known, the one-loop (1L) vacuum polarization

(VP) correction scales as

∆E(1L)

VP =

α
π

(Zα)4
n3 FVP(Zα) ,

(D1)

where FVP(Zα) is a dimensionless function. The ﬁrst few
terms of FVP(Zα) for S states can be found in a number of
review articles, e.g. [30, 31]. E.g., the lowest-order term for
40 (nS) = −4/15. The ﬁrst index of the AVP-
S states is AVP
coefﬁcients denotes the power of Zα, and the second denotes
the power of ln[(Zα)−2].

For states with nonvanishing angular momenta, it is well
known that the leading terms in the expansion of FVP(Zα)
vanish. In the order α(Zα)6, the leading coefﬁcients for P
states [32] are known to read as follows,

These results are consistent with the particular case n = 2
treated on p. 124 of Ref. [31], for which the coefﬁcients read
A70(2P1/2) = 41π/3072 and A70(2P3/2) = 7π/1024. Both
the AVP
70 coefﬁcients vanish for D states
and all states with higher angular momenta. Note that the self-
energy remainder function GSE, as calculated in Refs. [34, 35]
for P states, contains all contributions of order α (Zα)7 due
to the one-photon self-energy. For D states and states with
higher angular momenta, self-energy shifts of order α (Zα)6
have been compiled, e.g., in Ref. [14], and the self-energy cor-
rections of order α (Zα)7 vanish. These remarks supplement
the above results for the one-loop vacuum polarization.

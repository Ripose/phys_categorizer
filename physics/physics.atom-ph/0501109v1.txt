Abstract. We present designs for Ioﬀe-Pritchard type magnetic traps using planar patterns of hard mag-

netic material. Two designs are based on 40 µm foil of FePt. The ﬁrst sample yields calculated axial and

radial trap frequencies of 51 Hz and 6.8 kHz, respectively. For the second sample the calculated frequen-

cies are 34 Hz and 11 kHz. The structures were produced by spark erosion and used successfully as a

magneto-optical trap and loaded as a magnetic trap. A third design is based on lithographically patterned

250 nm ﬁlm of FePt on a Si substrate and yields an array of 19 traps with calculated axial and radial trap

frequencies of 1.5 and 110 kHz, respectively.

The working principle of this design can be explained

as follows: (n-1) cylindrical quadrupoles are formed be-

tween n equally long strips. As one can see the strips are

shifted with respect to each other. This displacement ef-

fectively adds two extra pieces of magnetic material that

a width of 5 µm and a length of 100 µm. The slit is 2 µm and

the shift is 10 µm. The traps are formed at a distance of 4 µm

from the surface. The magnetic ﬁeld contour lines are at 0.3

mT intervals.

Magnetic microstructures fabricated from permanent

magnetic ﬁlms have potential advantages over current car-

rying conductors as they can produce large ﬁeld gradients

without dissipating any energy and with reduced John-

son noise caused by thermal ﬂuctuations. Thermally in-

duced losses can take place in ultra-cold atoms magnet-

ically trapped near surfaces of conducting metals [24,25,

26]. Thermal current ﬂuctuations, which increase with de-

creasing resistivity of the solid, induce magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuc-

tuations that are stronger close to the surface of the solid.

Choosing a high resistivity material and a ﬁlm with a

thickness much smaller than the skin depth can reduce

this problem. Using an FePt ﬁlm with a thickness of 250

nm, much smaller than the skin depth (δ = 100 µm at 2.1

MHz) it should be possible to create long-lived traps very

close to the surface.

with the small scale of the structures produces large mag-

The exact nondipole minimal-coupling Hamiltonian for an atom interacting with an explicitly time- and
space-dependent laser ﬁeld is transformed into the rest frame of a classical free electron in the laser ﬁeld, i.e.,
into the Kramers-Henneberger frame. The new form of the Hamiltonian is used to study nondipole effects in
the high-intensity, high-frequency regime. Fully three dimensional nondipole ab initio wavepacket calculations
show that the ionization probability may decrease for increasing ﬁeld strength. We identify a unique signature
for the onset of this dynamical stabilization effect in the photoelectron spectrum.

PACS numbers: 42.50.Hz,32.80.Rm,32.80.Fb.

The general ﬁeld of laser-matter interactions is character-
ized by impressive progress in light-source technology. Light
sources with pulses of shorter and shorter duration and ever
increasing intensities are being developed. Pulses containing
only a few cycles and with a duration of less than 10 fs are now
Intensities of 1014 W/cm2 are
commercially available [1].
routinely provided, and intensities two orders of magnitude
higher, reaching the ﬁeld strength of the Coulomb interaction
in atoms and molecules, are not unusual. Femtosecond laser
pulses have been used to produce coherent extreme-ultraviolet
pulses of attosecond duration, and the expression “attosecond
metrology” [2] was coined for the investigation of matter with
such short pulses [3]. Other developments include the large-
scale intense free-electron laser projects at DESY (Hamburg,
Germany) and SLAC (Stanford, USA). The TESLA test fa-
cility in Hamburg has begun operation in the far-ultraviolet
regime and, e.g., a study of the interaction of intense soft X-
rays with atom clusters was reported [4]. The clusters ab-
sorbed energy much more efﬁciently than anticipated from
existing models, and the physical mechanism responsible for
the excess in the absorbed energy is currently subject to some
controversy [5].

Typically the laser-atom interaction is described in the
dipole approximation where several equivalent formulations
exist; the most popular ones being the velocity gauge, the
length gauge and the Kramers-Henneberger frame [6]. It is,
however, clear that the new light sources alluded to above
pave the way for studies of atomic and molecular systems
under extreme nonperturbative conditions [7]. In the case of
atoms interacting with light from the vacuum-ultra-violet free-
electron laser the dipole approximation cannot be expected to
be valid [8]. Thus, motivated by the need to include the full
k · r-term in the description of the light-matter interaction, we
here revisit the question of equivalent formulations of electro-
dynamics.

We transform the exact nondipole minimal-coupling
Hamiltonian for an atom in an explicitly time- and space-
dependent ﬁeld into the rest frame of a classical free elec-
tron in the laser ﬁeld. In the dipole approximation, this frame
is known as the Kramers-Henneberger frame [9]. Our trans-

formed exact nondipole Hamiltonian takes a simple form and
is very useful for the discussion of strong-ﬁeld dynamics. We
apply it to the study of H in the high-intensity, high-frequency
regime, and conﬁrm the phenomenon of atomic stabilization,
i.e., the possibility of having a decreasing ionization probabil-
ity/rate with increasing intensity (for reviews see, e.g., [10]).
Most importantly, we point out that the onset of the dynamic
stabilization can be directly observed from electron energy
spectra. [Atomic units (a.u.) with me = e = ~ = 1 are used
throughout. All derivations are straightforwardly generalized
to atoms and molecules involving more electrons.]

The minimal coupling scheme determines the Hamiltonian
for a charged particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld through the
vector potential A(η) with η ≡ ωt − k · r, and k the wave
number. The scheme implies that the canonical momentum is
obtained by p → p − qA and for an electron of charge q =
−1 in atomic units, we have p + A, and the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation reads

i∂tΨv(r, t) =

(p + A(η))2 + V (r)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

Ψv(r, t),

(1)

where the subscript v refers to the velocity gauge. The ad-
vantage of this formulation is that the spatial dependence of
the ﬁeld is explicitly accounted for through its presence in the
vector potential. A disadvantage is that the interaction is not
expressed in terms of the physical E- and B-ﬁelds. Also nu-
merically, the evaluation of the action of the A · p-term can
be quite involved unless a diagonal representation of Ψv with
respect to this operator is applied. Until now only the alterna-
tive multipole formulation of Power-Zienau-Woolley [6, 11]
has, in principle, kept the spatial dependence to all orders.
The multipolar form represents the interaction in terms of the
physical ﬁelds and the electron coordinate r, but, as the name
suggests, it is inherently designed to provide an expansion of
the light-matter interaction, and consequently very impracti-
cal if one wishes to retain k · r to all orders.

Here, we transform the Schr¨odinger equation into a new
form by applying a nondipole Kramers-Henneberger transfor-
mation. Let

ΨKH = U Ψv = exp[i α(η) · p]Ψv,

represents the quiver motion relative to the laboratory frame

responding to the new point of view is obtained by taking the

we obtain i∂tΨKH(r, t) = HKH ΨKH(r, t) with

To evaluate the effect of the unitary translation operators
in (4), we use the operator identity known as the Baker-
Hausdorff lemma [12] and take advantage of the Coulomb
gauge restriction [p, A] = 0 and k · A = 0. The resulting

which holds for a general elliptically polarized ﬁeld. Within
the dipole approximation A and α are space-independent, the
last three terms are absent, and (5) reduces to the well-known
result [9]. In the nondipole case, the importance of these terms
is readily understood, e.g., in terms of their effect on a contin-
uum wave function. The two terms proportional to k2 are of
the order of E2
0 v2/(ω2c2) and E0v/c2, respectively, whereas
the last term is of order E0v2/(ωc). We thus see that the ef-
fect of the dominant term on a wave function is reduced by a
factor ∼ E0/(ωc) compared to the p2-term. The factor E0/ω
is precisely the quiver velocity of the electron vquiver, so we
expect that the last three terms may be neglected as long as
vquiver/c ≪ 1. Whenever this condition is fulﬁlled, the non-
relativistic approach is automatically justiﬁed as well. As it
turns out, for the ﬁeld parameters considered here, the effect
of the nondipole terms is effectively given by the spatial de-
pendence of the vector potential in the A2-term.

As a ﬁrst application of the new form of the Hamiltonian we
consider the interaction with high-intensity, high-frequency
ﬁelds. In this so-called stabilization regime [10], atoms may
go through a region of decreasing ionization for increasing
ﬁeld strength. Stabilization was experimentally observed with
Rydberg atoms [13]. With the development of new light
sources, dynamic stabilization of ground state atoms is, how-
ever, expected to be within experimental reach in the near fu-
ture [14].

Nondipole terms were investigated in approximate ways
earlier and found to have a detrimental effect on the stabi-

lization [15, 16]. The relative role of the different nondipole
terms in (5) is illustrated in Fig. 1 for a two-dimensional
model atom [16]. The ground state was exposed to a laser
pulse propagating in the x direction and of linear polariza-
tion up along the z-axis corresponding to the vector poten-
tial A(η) = E0
ω f (η) sin(η + φ)up with f (η) the envelope,
E0 the electric ﬁeld amplitude and φ a phase that ensures
that the vector potential represents a physical ﬁeld [17]. The
wave function was propagated on a Cartesian grid by means
of the split-step operator technique [18]. A 5-cycle laser pulse
with central frequency ω = 1 a.u.
(46 nm) corresponding
to the pulse duration T = 760 as, and with carrier-envelope
2
, was employed. The intensity range was
f (η) = sin
set to 0 < I0 < 1.4 × 1019 W/cm2. The population not ac-
(cid:1)
counted for in Fig. 1, is left in excited states. The effects of the
last three terms in the Hamiltonian as well as the spatial de-
pendence of the quiver amplitude α(r, t) cannot be resolved
on the scale of Fig. 1. Hence, the nondipole effect observed
for ﬁeld strengths greater than 7 a.u. are exclusively related to
the spatial dependence of the A2-term.

We have, accordingly, justiﬁed that for the parameters un-
der concern, it is a very accurate approach to apply the Hamil-
tonian (5), neglecting the last three additional kinetic energy
terms arising from the transformation (2), to a fully three-
dimensional study of ionization of a real ground state atom by
intense short wave light ﬁeld beyond the dipole approxima-
tion. We consider H(1s) exposed to 5-cycle laser pulses in the
attosecond range with central frequencies ω = 1 a.u. and ω =

and the initial ﬁeld-free H(1s) state is obtained from the exact
analytical expression. Reﬂection at the edges r = rmax =
200 a.u. is avoided by imposing an absorbing boundary. For
convergence, we include harmonics up to lmax = 29, check
for gauge invariance, use propagation time-step ∆t = 0.01
a.u., and set ∆r = 0.2 a.u.. Photoelectron probability dis-
tributions are calculated by projecting the wave function onto
the ﬁeld-free (discretized) continuum states. We note that the
presence of nondipole terms will lead to a population of dif-
ferent m-values in (6).

In Fig. 2 total ionization- and ground state probabilities are
shown for the fully three-dimensional case in the nondipole
and dipole limits for two different frequencies. We ob-
serve that the dipole approximation remains valid up to ﬁeld
strengths of the order of 10 a.u., and we ﬁnd in general only a

small effect of the nondipole terms on stabilization.

We now turn to the central question of how stabilization
can most efﬁciently be experimentally detected. Measurement
of absolute probabilities will require control of all parameters
of the experiment: atom density, pulse characteristics, repe-
tition rates, electron counts etc.. We therefore suggest mea-
suring the energy-differential photoelectron spectrum. Figure

tric ﬁeld strength and energy E of the ionized electron with

where α0 ≡ E0/ω2 is the quiver amplitude. The dipole and
nondipole results are practically identical, and only the dipole
results are shown in Fig. 3. For lower ﬁeld strengths a reg-
ular pattern of multiphoton resonances corresponding to ab-
sorption of 1ω, 2ω or 3ω from the ﬁeld is present. However,
the multiphoton ionization process weakens at higher inten-
sities as the stabilization sets in. Simultaneously, there is a
steady growth in the portion of low-energy photoelectrons in
the spectrum which can be assigned to V0 of (7). That V0
is responsible for the growth in the low-energy spectrum is
readily seen by comparison of the upper and middle panels.
The processes leading to ionization effectively divide into two
competing classes: The multiphoton ionization superimposed
on a monotonically increasing ’background’ ionization pro-
cess due to V0 solely. This is explicitly illustrated in the lower
panel of Fig. 3, where the total ionization probability vs. elec-
tric ﬁeld strength is shown [20]. Multiphoton ionization dom-
inates at lower ﬁeld strengths, whereas the picture is the op-
posite at higher values of E0. The ionization due to the V0
potential reﬂects to what extent the laser pulse is turned- on
and off adiabatically, and in a ’sudden approximation’ picture
it represents the lack of overlap between the ﬁeld-free and the
ﬁeld-dressed states. Common in both photoelectron spectra
is the presence of peaks in the probability density which can-
not be attributed to multiples of ω. Instead, they are a result
of the non-adiabatic turn-on and turn-off of the ﬁeld and can
be associated with the higher-order Fourier components of the
pulse.

In summary, we presented a new formulation of the interac-
tion between atoms and light maintaining full spatial depen-
dence of the ﬁelds. We analyzed the terms in the interaction
Hamiltonian and argued, supported by numerical evidence,
that certain terms can be neglected. For the present ﬁeld pa-
rameters, the main nondipole effects come from A(η)2. As an
application, we considered the phenomenon of dynamic sta-
bilization in intense high-frequency ﬁelds. We showed by full
three-dimensional wavepacket simulations that the nondipole
terms do not destroy the stabilization effect, and most impor-
tantly that the photoelectron spectra in the stabilization regime
shows very characteristic features: After onset of stabilization
all ionized electrons have very low kinetic energy. Thus, by
simply measuring the energy of the released electrons stabi-
lization can be detected.

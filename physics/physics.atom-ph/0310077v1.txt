The X1Σ+ state of NaRb was studied by Fourier transform spectroscopy. An accurate potential
energy curve was derived from more than 8800 transitions in isotopomers 23Na85Rb and 23Na87Rb.

INTRODUCTION

The heteronuclear alkali dimers attract interest of both
experimental and theoretical researchers involved in colli-
sion dynamics, photoassociative spectroscopy, laser cool-
ing and trapping of alkali atoms [1, 2, 3, 4]. Special inter-
est is put on the study of the ground states and especially
near the atomic asymptote, since the precise knowledge
of the long-range interactions between two diﬀerent types
of alkali atoms is necessary for understanding and real-
ization of such cold collision processes as sympathetic
cooling, formation of two species BEC (TBEC) and ul-
tracold heteronuclear molecules.

Although the NaRb molecule is one of the promising
candidates for TBEC [4], the experimental information
on the ground singlet state is still limited.

Accurate term values of the X1Σ+ state were deter-
mined by the Doppler-free polarization spectroscopy [5].
They cover a range of low vibrational quantum numbers
v′′ ∈ [0, 6] with limited sets of rotational quantum num-
bers (e.g. J ′′ ∈ [1, 80] for v′′ = 0 and J ′′ ∈ [18, 36] for
v′′ = 6). Later Kasahara et al. [6] extended the range of
v′′ up to v′′ = 30, but only for J ′′ = 10, 12. On the other
hand the recent experiment by the Riga group [7] col-
lected about 300 transition frequencies to energy levels
with a much wider spectrum of vibrational and rotational
quantum numbers (v′′ ∈ [15, 76], J ′′ ∈ [12, 64]) but with
relatively moderate accuracy ( 0.1 cm−1 ). A hybrid po-
tential for the NaRb ground state based on extrapolation
between regions determined from the early experimental
data [5, 6] and the theoretical dispersion coeﬃcients from
Ref. [8] was constructed by Zemke et al. [9] giving an im-
proved estimate on the dissociation energy of the ground
state - De = 5030.75 cm−1.

On the theoretical side two papers have recently ap-
peared: by Korek et al.
[10] and by Zaitsevskii et al.
[11]. In both of them theoretical potential energy curves

The NaRb molecules were produced in a single section
heat-pipe oven similar to that described in Ref. [12] by
heating 5 g of Na (purity 99.95 %) and 10 g of Rb (purity
99.75 %, natural isotopic composition) from Alfa Aesar.
The oven was operated at temperatures between 560 K
and 600 K and typically with 2 mbar of Ar as buﬀer
gas. At these conditions apart from the atomic vapors
all three types of molecules are formed - Na2, Rb2 and
NaRb. This mixture was illuminated by three diﬀerent
laser sources: a single mode, frequency doubled Nd:YAG
laser, Ar+ ion laser and Rhodamine 6G dye laser. Their
wavelengths fall in a spectral window with weak absorp-
tion of Rb2. Setting the working temperatures as low
as possible we reduced the density of the Na2 molecules
reaching a relatively intense NaRb spectra free of Na2
emission. The heat pipe oven was in operation more than
60 hours without reﬁlling and at the end of the experi-
ment was still in good working condition.

The ﬂuorescence from the oven was collected in the
direction opposite to the propagation of the laser beam
and then focused into the input aperture of Bruker IFS
120 HR Fourier transform spectrometer. The signal was
detected with a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube
or a silicon diode. The scanning path of the spectrometer
was set to reach a typical resolution of 0.0115 cm−1 ÷
0.03 cm−1 and the number of scans for averaging varied
between 10 and 20. In order to avoid the illumination of
the detector by the He-Ne laser, used for calibration of
the spectrometer, a notch ﬁlter with 8 nm FWHM was
introduced. For better signal-to-noise ratio some spectra
were recorded by limiting the desired spectral window
with colored glass or interference ﬁlters.

The single mode,

frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser
with a typical output power of 70 mW at 532.1 nm ex-
cited the C1Σ+ ← X1Σ+ and D1Π ← X1Σ+ systems
of NaRb, compare Fig. 1. The frequency was varied
between 18787.25 cm−1 and 18788.44 cm−1 and spectra
were recorded at frequencies which excite strong ﬂuores-
cence.

The Ar+ ion laser was operated both in single (typi-
cal power 100÷500 mW) and multi mode (typical power
0.5÷3 W) regimes. The 514.5 nm, 501.7 nm, 496.5 nm,
488.0 nm and 476.5 nm Ar+ ion laser lines induced ﬂu-
orescence mainly due to the D1Π ← X1Σ+ system of
NaRb. The Na2 B1Πu → X1Σ+
g band was also observed,
especially exciting with the bluer Ar+ laser lines, but its
intensity was reduced by decreasing the working temper-
ature down to 560 K. Along with the D ← X system,
the 514.5 nm line excites also transitions in the C1Σ+ ←
X1Σ+ system of NaRb [7]. The special form of poten-

tial energy curve of the C1Σ+ state [10] results in favor-
able Franck-Condon factors for transitions from some C
state levels both to low and high lying energy levels of
the ground state. Such C state levels are excited by the
514.5 nm line and the green ﬂorescence of the D ← X
system is accompanied by a red ﬂuorescence due to C ←
X transitions, which reach v′′ = 76 of the ground state
(Fig. 2).

In order to bring the frequency of the single mode
Ar+ laser exactly in resonance with desired transitions
we did the following. As a ﬁrst step we recorded the
LIF for a given frequency simultaneously with the Fourier
spectrometer and a GCA/McPherson Instruments scan-
ning monochromator (1m focal length). The high reso-
lution Fourier spectrum helped us to assign unambigu-
ously the record of the monochromator. Then we set the
monochromator on a strong and pronounced line of the
progression of interest and we tuned the Ar+ laser fre-
quency until the maximum signal on the monochromator
was reached. The frequency stability of the laser with
a temperature stabilized intracavity etalon was suﬃcient
in order to perform 10 to 20 scans with the Fourier spec-
trometer.

The Rhodamine 6G laser excites the B1Π ← X1Σ+
transition and also weak transitions in the C1Σ+ ←
X1Σ+ system and was used for two reasons. The ﬁrst
was to enrich the information on the ground state lev-
els with intermediate vibrational quantum numbers be-
cause of the gap between the levels from the D1Π ←
X1Σ+ system (mainly with low v′′) and those from the
C1Σ+ ← X1Σ+ system (mainly with high v′′). Secondly,
we wanted to excite levels of the B state with signiﬁcant
triplet admixture due to perturbations from the neigh-
boring b3Π and c3Σ+ states [5, 13].
Indeed, scanning
the frequency of the dye laser from 16729 cm−1 to 16965
cm−1 we encountered a large number of excitations where

a3Σ+ bands of NaRb excited by a single mode Rhodamine 6G
laser. The insert shows the continuum due to the bound-free
emission to the repulsive wall of the a3Σ+ state.

a second ﬂuorescence band around 12000 cm−1 appeared
along with the B ← X system (see Fig. 3). The analysis
of this band (a report is in preparation) conﬁrmed that
we have observed transitions to the ground triplet state
a3Σ+.

All transitions excited in Na85Rb and Na87Rb by the
single mode Nd:YAG and Rhodamine 6G lasers and by
the Ar+ laser in single- and multi mode, assigned and
used in this analysis are listed in Table 1 of the supple-
mentary material (EPAPS No. ....).

III. ANALYSIS

The assignment of the recorded spectra was simpliﬁed
by the published potential energy curve in Ref. [7]. After
we identiﬁed the strongest progressions, which were al-
ready observed in previous studies [7, 11, 14, 15], a new
potential was ﬁtted. This preliminary potential was fur-
ther improved ﬁlling additionally collected experimental
data; this sequential procedure allows continuous check-
ing of the assignment, especially for high J ′′ and in cases
of large gaps in v′′. The total data set (Fig. 4) consists
of more than 6150 transitions in Na85Rb and 2650 in
Na87Rb given in Table 2 of the supplementary material
(EPAPS No.....).

[12].

For ﬁtting the experimental data we used the approach
adopted in Ref.
In order to exclude any ﬁtting
parameters concerning the excited states, we ﬁtted the
ground state potential directly to the observed diﬀerences
between ground state levels. In our case of 8800 transi-
tions we selected about 43300 diﬀerences for representing
the diﬀerent cases of vibrational intervals (for details see
also [12]). The uncertainties of the diﬀerences were esti-

FIG. 4: The range of vibrational and rotational quantum
numbers of the observed ground state energy levels in Na85Rb
and Na87Rb

mated taking into account the instrumental accuracy and
resolution, and the signal-to-noise ratio for both transi-
tions forming the diﬀerence. The uncertainty of strong
lines was set to 0.002 ÷ 0.003 cm−1 increasing to 0.007
cm−1 for weaker ones with SNR ≈ 2. Diﬀerences which
were measured several times were averaged with weight-
ing factors determined from their uncertainties.

As already discussed in [12], for our experimental set
up a ﬂuorescence progression excited by a single mode
laser will be shifted in frequency if the laser is not tuned
to the center of the Doppler proﬁle. This problem is par-
tially overcome by ﬁtting diﬀerences instead of transition
frequencies. Nevertheless there can be still a residual
shift of the diﬀerences due to the frequency dependence
of the Doppler shift. For example if the laser frequency
around 20000 cm−1 is detuned from the line center by
one Doppler width (about 0.03 cm−1 for NaRb at 600
K) the diﬀerence between two transitions ν1 and ν2 sep-
arated by ν1 − ν2= 4000 cm−1 will be shifted from the
“true” one by 0.006 cm−1. This shift is comparable with
the typically expected uncertainty (≈ 0.004 cm−1) but
it cannot be determined in our experiment. Therefore,
initially we did not correct the uncertainties of the large
diﬀerences (a possible solution could be to increase the
uncertainty of the diﬀerence ν1 − ν2 proportionally to
the ratio (ν1 − ν2)/ν1). Large diﬀerences however were
checked carefully during the ﬁtting procedure and ﬁnally
no need for such correction was found.

IV. CONSTRUCTION OF PEC

The ground singlet states of both isotopomers of NaRb
are described in the adiabatic approximation with a sin-
gle potential energy curve. The potential was constructed
as a set of points {Ri, U (Ri)} (see Ref. [16]) connected
with cubic spline function. The pointwise representation

of the potential, however, is not convenient for long inter-
nuclear distances. On the other hand, in order to ensure
proper boundary conditions for solving the Schr¨odinger
equation for high vibrational energy levels, distances up
to R ≈ 20 ˚A are needed. Therefore for R ≥ Rout we
adopted the usual dispersion form:

U (R) = De − C6R

−6 − C8R

−8 − C10R

−10 ,

(1)

with coeﬃcients C6, C8 taken from Ref. [18, 19]. The
connecting point Rout and the parameters De and C10
were varied in order to ensure a smooth connection with
the pointwise potential as follows. Initially, the PEC was
constructed in a pointwise form up to 16 ˚A. After each
ﬁtting iteration De and C10 were adjusted to ﬁt the shape
of the pointwise potential between 13.0 ˚A and 16.0 ˚A to
the analytic formula (1). The crossing point of the point-
wise and the long range curves was taken as Rout. Since
the experimental data are almost insensitive to details of
the potential shape in this region, we found this proce-
dure suﬃcient and did not ﬁt the long range parameters
directly to the experimental data. Once the ﬁnal form
of the PEC was achieved, we found that it is possible
to extend the validity of the long range expression down
to approximately 11.8 ˚A. At the same time the quality
of the derived potential did not change if the analytic
formula (1) was ﬁtted to the shape of the pointwise po-
tential between 11.8 ˚A and 13.24 ˚A. A discussion on the
advantage of using this matching procedure can be found
in Ref. [20].

The ﬁnal set of potential parameters consists of 51
points. In order to calculate the value of the potential
for R < Rout a natural cubic spline [17] through all 51
points and for R ≥ Rout the long range expression (1)

should be used with parameters listed in Table I. This
ﬁnal PEC gives a standard deviation of σ = 0.0031 cm−1
and a normalized standard deviation of ¯σ = 0.70 showing
the internal consistency of the data set and the quality
of the derived potential.

In order to ﬁnd the region where the PEC is unambigu-
ously characterized by the experimental data we analyzed
the uncertainty of the ﬁtting parameters as described in
detail in Ref. [12, 21]. By minimizing the merit func-
tion χ2 using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
method [17, 22] it is possible to determine the parame-
ters on which χ2 and consequently the quality of the ﬁt
depend only weakly. The ﬁtting parameters in our case
are the values of the potential itself in a preset grid of
points. In Fig. 5 the uncertainties of the ﬁtted potential
for intermediate internuclear distances are presented for
three diﬀerent values of the singularity parameter ζ (see
[21]). Although the outer classical turning point of the
last observed energy level (v′′ = 76, J ′′ = 27) is 12.4 ˚A
we see that the shape of the potential energy curve is un-
ambiguously ﬁxed (within the experimental uncertainty)
approximately only between 3.0 ˚A and 9.8 ˚A since the
uncertainties there almost do not depend on ζ. There-
fore, although the ﬁtted potential energy curve describes

all the experimental data up to v′′ = 76, there is no rigor-
ous way to estimate the uncertainty of its shape beyond
9.8 ˚A (see also [12]). The result of Fig. 5 might indicate
that the correlation between the left (R < 3˚A) and right
(R > 9.8 ˚A) branch of the potential becomes signiﬁcant.
In this respect the reported potential in Table I for these
regions is only one possibility which describes our obser-
vations within the error limits. From Table I we derive
some parameters which will be useful when applying the
potential for other calculations and spectroscopic studies.
Their values are not rounded in order to keep consistency
with the data from Table I.

In Fig. 6 the potential energy curves published in
Ref. [7, 9] are compared with the pointwise potential
(PW) of this study. The reason for the diﬀerence be-
tween the PW potential and the Modiﬁed Lennard-Jones
(MLJ) potential [7] around Re is probably that for the
construction of the later potential the rotational quan-
tum numbers for levels with v′′ < 30 were limited only
to the narrow interval from [6] (J ′′ = 10, 12). With such
data set the rotational constant Bv can be determined
only with large uncertainty which corresponds to shifts
of the whole potential along the internuclear axes which
is clearly indicated in Fig. 6. As already discussed in Sec-
tion I the hybrid potential from Ref. [9] was constructed
using the whole range of available rotational quantum
numbers from the literature ([5, 6]) and therefore the
agreement with the present study around Re is much
better. The deviations between the PW and the hybrid
potential reaching 20 cm−1 for intermediate internuclear
distances are caused by the extrapolation between the
theoretical long range part of the potential and the ex-
perimental short range part. In the same region the ex-
perimentally determined shape of the MLJ potential is
in a much better agreement with the present study.

Since the primary data from [5] were not available to
us, we were able to check our potential only against the
data published in [6]. Forming diﬀerences between tran-
sition frequencies exactly as for our LIF data we found an
agreement with the diﬀerences predicted by the present
PEC from Table I with a standard deviation of 0.0026
cm−1, well within the expected experimental error of 100
MHz. Only two transitions ((12,11)-(17,10) and (12,11)-
(19,10)) were excluded from this comparison since diﬀer-
ences with them showed systematically large deviations
reaching 0.01 cm−1.

FIG. 6: Diﬀerences between the pointwise representation of
the NaRb ground state potential derived in this study (PW)
and previous potentials energy curves from Ref. [9] (Hybrid),
Ref. [7] (MLJ). The energy at the equilibrium point Re is set
to zero for all potentials and used as a reference point.

In Table II a set of Dunham coeﬃcients for 23Na85Rb is
listed which describes the whole set of the measured dif-
ferences for both isotopomers with a deviation of 0.0030
cm−1 and a normalized standard deviation of 0.84. For
calculating the eigenvalues for 23Na87Rb the usual scal-
ing rules were used. The distribution of the indexes of the
Dunham coeﬃcients indicates that for description of such
a large set of vibrational and rotational quantum num-
bers the parameters of the Dunahm expansion lose their
original meaning of “spectroscopic constants”. The ex-
tremely small values of some coeﬃcients (∼ 10−40 cm−1
!) indicate that they should be used with caution due to
roundoﬀ errors. At last, the extrapolation properties of
such set of Dunham coeﬃcients are doubtful. Therefore,
we prefer to give the full description of the experimen-
tal data by a potential energy curve, which is obviously
a much better physical model, and to present Dunham
coeﬃcients only for convenience since there are still ap-
plications where their use is easier and faster.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this paper a spectroscopic study of the NaRb ground
state is presented. A variety of laser sources was used to
excite several band systems in both isotopomers of the
NaRb molecule and the induced ﬂuorescence was ana-
lyzed with a high resolution Fourier transform spectrom-
eter. More than 8800 transitions were identiﬁed resulting
in a set of more than 4000 ground state energy levels with
wide range of vibrational and rotational quantum num-
bers. An accurate potential energy curve was ﬁtted to
the experimental data reproducing diﬀerences between
ground state energy levels with σ = 0.0031 cm−1 and
¯σ = 0.70.

In order to check the consistency of the derived poten-
tial energy curve we performed additional ﬁts in several

diﬀerent ways. Instead of ﬁtting diﬀerences, we applied
the commonly used approach of ﬁtting directly transition
frequencies, getting the term energies of the excited state
levels as free parameters. In this case two representations
of the potential were tried: a pointwise and an analytic
form described in detail in Ref. [23]. Both representa-
tions gave the same quality of the ﬁt compared to the
pointwise potential determined from diﬀerences and the
potentials were practically identical in the studied range.
Thus no additional parameters sets are given here in or-
der to avoid the confusion of the reader what potential
form should be preferred.

The classical turning point of the last observed energy
level (v′′ = 76, J ′′ = 27) is around 12.4 ˚A. Although
this point lies beyond the Le Roy radius for the NaRb
32S+52S asymptote (RLeRoy = 11.2 ˚A), the analysis of
the PEC uncertainties indicates that with the present
body of experimental data it is unsafe to determine C6
and the other dispersion coeﬃcients. For this reason
the experimental PEC was smoothly connected to a long
range potential formed by dispersion terms taken from
the literature [18, 19]. For better description of the near
asymptotic region of the PEC transition frequencies to
weakly bound energy levels are needed (see for exam-
ple [20]). Some improvement might be expected already
from the combined analysis of the X1Σ+ and a3Σ+ states
at long internuclear distances which is in progress.

Weiss et al. [4] applied the MLJ potential from [7] and
extended it for R > 11 ˚A by the long range parameters
from [8, 18] and the exchange interaction taken from [24]
to determine the singlet and triplet scattering lengths for
32S Na + 52S Rb. Using the newly derived potential for

7

the inner part we constructed the full potential with the
same long range parameters as in [4] and derived a singlet
scattering length of +305a0 (a0 ≈ 0.52918 ˚A, the Bohr
radius) for 23Na85Rb and +103a0 for 23Na87Rb. These
results do not agree with the ones from Ref. [4]: +167a0
(+50a0/-30a0) for 23Na85Rb and 55a0 (+3a0/-3a0) for
23Na87Rb. We used exactly the same approach for the
long range as in [4] to see clearly the inﬂuence of the
inner part of the potential. By the new values we will not
claim that we have determined more realistic scattering
lengths. Rather we want to point out that the existing
data do not allow to specify the scattering length in an
useful uncertainty interval. Note also that slight changes
in the exchange energy still allow to alter the sign of the
scattering length in 23Na85Rb. Thus energy levels closer
to the asymptote (< 4.5 cm−1) must be studied.

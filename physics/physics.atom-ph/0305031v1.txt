Using a wave packet propagation approach, we ﬁnd that the resonant charge transfer process of
H− near a Cu(111) surface is strongly inﬂuenced by transient hybrid states. These states originate
from an ion-induced conﬁnement parallel to the surface together with the surface-localization char-
acter of the metal potential along the surface normal. The lowest members of these states have
lifetimes of the order of interaction times in typical particle-surface scattering experiments. The
propagation of the electron probability density provides clear evidence for this eﬀect in visualizing
the evolution and the decay of these transient states.

The investigation of electron transfer and orbital hy-
bridization processes during the interaction of a projectile
atom or ion with a metal surface is of both fundamen-
tal and practical importance. The ensuing knowledge
ﬁnds valuable use in various applied ﬁelds of physics, such
as, development of ion sources, control of ion-wall inter-
actions in fusion plasma, surface chemistry and analy-
sis, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and reactive ion
etching[1, 2]. Of basic interest is the detailed under-
standing of single-electron transfer leading to either ion-
ization or neutralization of a surface-scattered projec-
tile. This process of resonant charge transfer (RCT) has
been addressed by employing diﬀerent non-perturbative
theoretical methods,
including single-center basis-set-
expansion[3], complex coordinates rotation[4], two-center
expansion[5], multi-center expansion techniques[6], and
the direct numerical integration of the eﬀective single-
electron Schr¨odinger equation by Crank-Nicholson wave
packet propagation (CNP)[7, 8, 9, 10].

Of all these methods, CNP is most ﬂexible in the sense
that it can readily be applied to any parametrized eﬀec-
tive potential that may be used to represent the elec-
tronic structure of substrate and projectile. In contrast
to expansion methods that usually simplify the target to
a free-electron (jellium) metal, CNP allows for a signiﬁ-
cantly more detailed representation of the substrate elec-
tronic structure, including the eﬀect of band gaps[7, 11],
surface states[8], and image states on the RCT dynamics.

The Cu(111) surface is of particular interest since (a)
the aﬃnity level of H− lies within the L-band gap of
the surface and (b) it serves as a prototype of a metal
surface that can localize a surface state within its band
gap. We show that for the H−/Cu(111) system charge
transfer is to a large extent channeled through transient
hybrid states that are conﬁned parallel to the surface
by the combined inﬂuence of surface and projectile po-
tentials. H− is described by an eﬀective potential that
models the interaction of the active electron with a po-
larizable core[12]. A one-dimensional [in the co-ordinate
(z) of surface normal] single-electron eﬀective potential,

constructed from pseudopotential local density calcula-
tions, is employed to model the surface[13]. This poten-
tial reproduces the observed and/or ab initio L-band gap
position, surface state and image states for zero electron
momentum component kpar parallel to the surface (x di-
rection). Note that the ﬁrst image state lies in the band
gap while higher ones are degenerate with the conduction
band[13]. We employ the CNP[9, 10] of the initial free
H− wave function φionover a two-dimensional numerical
grid in which the metal continuum is approximated by
free electronic motion in x direction. Our grid includes
100 layers on the bulk and extends to z = 200 a.u. on the
vacuum side. The topmost layer of lattice points deﬁnes
z = 0. The grid covers 200 a.u. in x. The grid spacings
∆z = ∆x = 0.2 a.u. yield good convergence.

For ﬁxed ion-surface distances D, the numerical prop-
agation over time t yields Φ(t) and the ionic survival am-
plitude A(t) = hΦ(t)|φioni. The real part of the Fourier
transform (FT) of this amplitude yields the projected
density of states (PDOS) that exhibits resonance struc-
tures. The position, width, and amplitude of these res-
onances provide, respectively, the energy, lifetime, and
population of the states. Contrary to the parametric ﬁt-
ting adopted in Ref. 8, a direct FT of A(t) is performed
by propagating, in time-steps ∆t = 0.1 a.u., over a pe-
riod long enough for acceptable convergence. Figure 1
depicts the PDOS (thick solid curve) for three typical
values of D. Results neglecting the electronic motion
parallel to the surface are obtained by propagating over
a one-dimensional grid along z and are shown (short-
dashed curve) for comparisons. Note, although for this
1-D propagation, due to the absence of any decay con-
tinuum, A(t) never fully converges, we still carry out the
FT of A(t) calculated over a ﬁnite time, since we are in-
terested only in identifying resonances in the 1-D PDOS.

At D = 11 a.u. [Fig 1(a)], our results with or without
the parallel motion included show discretized structures
corresponding to the valence and conduction band. The
aﬃnity level resonance (at −1.56 eV) and the surface
state resonance (at −5.31 eV) are also present in both cal-

culations, although the aﬃnity level is shifted downward
from the unperturbed asymptotic aﬃnity of −0.76 eV.
Strikingly, two small peaks appear just above the surface
state resonance for the results that include the parallel
motion. For D = 5 a.u. [Fig. 1(b)], the aﬃnity level and
the surface state resonance are present in both results,
with and without parallel motion, but the structures in
between for the calculation that incorporates electronic
parallel motion increase in number and strength. Clearly,
these new resonances appear only when the electronic
parallel degree of freedom is switched on. For a jellium
Cu surface the PDOS [Fig. 1(b), long-dashed curve] only
shows a wide aﬃnity level peak, as expected, thus in-
dicating that the resonances are due to details in the
surface band structure that are not accounted for in the
simplistic jellium model. For a more complete portrayal
of the origin of these features we also show the PDOS
[Fig. 1(b), thin solid curve], including the parallel motion,
for Cu(100), which has a similar band gap in the direc-
tion normal to the surface but, contrary to Cu(111), no
surface state inside the gap[13]. This shows valence band
structures up to −3.1 eV and the aﬃnity level at −1 eV

but no signiﬁcant feature in between. Evidently, the extra
features in the Cu(111) PDOS between the surface state
and the aﬃnity level resonances must be originating both
from the parallel degree of freedom of the electron and
the special localizing property of the Cu(111) potential
along the surface normal that binds a surface state in-
side the band gap. For very close ion-surface separation,
D = 1 a.u., these features almost disappear, while two
similar resonances superimposed on the conduction band
spearhead, at −0.67 and −0.35 eV [Fig. 1(c)], above the
aﬃnity level. These resonances, in analogy with the ones
below the aﬃnity level, also originate from the electron
parallel motion and the weak binding of the long-range
tail of the surface potential.

The origin and evolution of this eﬀect with decreasing
D can be understood as follows. As H− moves towards
the surface, the ion potential gradually deepens following,
at large D, the classical image interaction. Consequently,
the spherical symmetry of the ion potential gets broken
by the surface potential “slope”, which becomes steep-
est in the vicinity of metal-vacuum interface. Suﬃciently
close to the surface, the parallelly-stretched asymmetric
top of the ion potential conﬁnes a new state. Although
this state is bound in the parallel direction, whether or
not it will live long will depend on how much binding
it experiences in the direction normal to the surface. In-
deed, for Cu(111) the surface potential has enough reﬂec-
tivity to enable the formation of a localized surface state
within the band gap. As a consequence, the new state,
conﬁned parallelly by the incoming ion, is also (temporar-
ily) bound in the normal direction by the Cu(111) po-
tential. This state is relatively long-lived and appears as
a fairly narrow peak in the PDOS spectrum [Fig 1(a)].
As the ion moves closer to the surface, the number of
states conﬁned parallelly increases and additional peaks
emerge in the PDOS [Fig. 1(b)]. For the H−/Cu(100)
system, in contrast, since the surface potential lacks suf-
ﬁcient surface-localizing reﬂectivity (it fails to support a
surface state within the band gap), the states, conﬁned
parallelly by the ion, decay rapidly into the metal valence
band, as indicated by the broad bump in the valence band
of Cu(100) [Fig. 1(b)]. Therefore, these new resonances
near Cu(111) are parallelly conﬁned hybrids.

The surface state is not bound in the parallel direction.
A resonance state that energetically lies above the sur-
face state while being conﬁned parallelly has to be less
bound in the normal direction than the surface state. A
reduction of the normal binding can be achieved by slid-
ing up the potential at the bulk-vacuum interface, that is,
by moving the mean position of the wave function in nor-
mal direction towards the ion. This increases the overlap
between the ionic wave function and that of the conﬁned
state. Consequently, for a given ion-surface separation,
we expect the lowest parallelly conﬁned state to be popu-
lated ﬁrst because of its strongest wave function overlap
with the ion. This is seen in Fig. 2, which depicts the

propagated wave packet probability density |Φ(t)|2 at t
= 30, 70, 120 and 165 a.u. for ﬁxed D = 5 a.u. Figure 2(a)
(t = 30 a.u.) shows an approximately nodeless structure
outside the surface plane implying that over a short prop-
agation time the ion populates predominantly the lowest
parallelly conﬁned state. However, at later times and in-
creasing population of higher parallelly conﬁned states,
the wave packet spreads along the parallel co-ordinate
forming additional nodal structures. Notably, since the
parallel component of the wave packet outside the sur-
face is a time-dependent linear combination of parallelly
conﬁned stationary states with diﬀerent nodal structures,
the position of a node moves with time. The ripples seen
along the normal direction inside the bulk are due to the
periodic bulk potential and a faint blob beyond z ≈ 20
a.u. on the vacuum side [Fig. 2(b-d)] represents the evo-
lution of weakly populated image states.

Fig. 3 shows the energy and the width of various reso-
nances as a function of D. Our results for aﬃnity level
and surface state resonances are qualitatively similar to
previous calculations[8]. At large distances, the energy
[Fig. 3(a)] of the aﬃnity level resonance (ﬁlled circles) is
solely governed by image interactions leading to a good
agreement with corresponding jellium results (opaque cir-
cles). In Fig. 3(b) on the other hand, aﬃnity level res-
onance widths for Cu(111) are smaller than the jellium
predictions at large distances, since in the jellium case no
band gap exists and electrons can decay in the normal
direction. The strong interaction, seen in the distance-
dependent widths and energies between the aﬃnity level
resonance and the surface state resonance (ﬁlled squares)
for small D, is the consequence of an indirect coupling be-
tween the corresponding discrete quasi-stationary states

through the surface state continuum[8].
Interestingly,
both energy and width of the parallelly conﬁned reso-
nances depend only weakly on D (Fig. 3). We explain
this near-stabilization by couplings of a given parallelly
conﬁned state with both aﬃnity and surface state that
have comparable strength. These couplings result in op-
posite level shifts and comparable rates (widths) for tran-
sitions between the aﬃnity and parallelly conﬁned state
and between the parallelly conﬁned state and the surface
state. The same argument explains the stabilization of
resonances just above the ionic resonance for very close
D where the states are interacting with the ion and the
conduction band. Furthermore, as discussed before, the
state with maximum binding in the parallel direction has
the strongest overlap with the aﬃnity level and the weak-
est with the surface state. As a result, while it is “fed”
by the ion the most, it decays through the surface state
continuum the least acquiring a narrow width [Fig. 3(b)].
The counter-argument explains the large widths for min-
imally conﬁned states in the parallel direction.

During the approach to the surface the projectile grad-
ually decelerates in the normal direction along its incom-
ing trajectory, owing to the repulsive interaction between
its neutral core and surface atoms, until its normal ve-
locity becomes zero at the point of closest approach. For
specular reﬂection, it re-gains its original normal velocity.
For a given initial kinetic energy and angle of incidence,
we simulate the classical ion-trajectory by modeling the
core-surface interaction via a plane-averaged interatomic
potential[14]. This deﬁnes a distance of closest approach
as a function of the initial normal velocity. Since the ion
moves slowly near the surface, the adiabatic (ﬁxed-ion)
results (Figs. 1-3) provide a good guideline to understand
the calculations for a moving ion. In Fig. 4, we present

tile. A remarkable signature of the parallel conﬁnement
is ﬁnally seen on the outward excursion of the ion in
Fig. 4(d) at D = 6.59 a.u.: the entrapment of the elec-
tron back in parallelly conﬁned states results in decay-jets
into the bulk and subsequent re-ionization of the projec-
tile (note the strong trapping at the ion position). As
an observable consequence of the strong participation of
parallelly conﬁned states in the decay near Cu(111), we
ﬁnd about 6% ion survival after the scattering of H− from
this surface as opposed to about 2% from Cu(100), which
is free from this eﬀect. A detailed comparative study will
be published elsewhere[15].

In conclusion, we demonstrate signiﬁcant parallel con-
ﬁnement eﬀects in resonant neutralization of H− near
Cu(111) by directly analyzing the evolution of the active
electron’s wave packet probability density. A surface-
induced breakdown of the ionic spherical symmetry and
signiﬁcant reﬂectivity of the surface potential is responsi-
ble for this conﬁnement. Finally, there is nothing special
about Cu(111). Any of the surfaces, namely, Ag(111),
Au(111), Pd(111) etc., supporting a surface state in the
L-band gap is expected to show similar parallel conﬁne-
ment phenomena during the RCT process.

H− ions with 50 eV asymptotic energy at 60o incidence
with respect to the surface. In Fig. 4(a), D = 10.5 a.u.,
the ion predominantly populates the state conﬁned most
strongly in the parallel direction. Reaching D = 2.76
a.u., Fig. 4(b), the wave packet spreads over all avail-
able parallelly conﬁned states, and clear nodal structures
emerge symmetrically along the parallel direction out-
side the surface with each “bead” emanating a jet into
the bulk. Electrons in the central jet have small parallel
velocity indicating their ejection from the most tightly
conﬁned state. A steady increase of the parallel velocity
is evidenced going symmetrically away from the center
in parallel direction since the more distant jets originate
from less strongly conﬁned states. In Fig. 4(c), the ion ar-
rives roughly at the distance of closest approach, 0.5 a.u.,
where the adiabatic energy position of the ionic resonance
moves very close to the conduction band [Fig. 3(a)] and
induces new resonances above the ionic level. Again, the
node formation and resulting jets are seen, although the
shape of the wave packet density is now dominated by a
strong decay into the conduction band as well as by the
subsequent population of image states, degenerate with
the conduction band, on the vacuum side of the projec-

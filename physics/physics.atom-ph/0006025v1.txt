Results are presented for simulations of electron-positron
pair production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions leading to
electron capture and positron ejection. We apply a two-center
relativistic continuum distorted-wave model to represent the
electron/positron dynamics during the collision process. The
results are compared with experimental cross-section data for
La57+ and Au79+ impact on Gold, Silver and Copper targets.
The theory is in very good agreement with experiment, veri-
fying the result that the process increases in importance with
both collision energy and target atomic number, and improves
upon previous simulations of this process.

Early theoretical work on the production of an e−/e+
pair through heavy-ion collisions considered only the cre-
ation of the electron and positron in the continuum.
However capture by pair production (CPP), in which the
electron is formed in a bound state of one or other ion,
becomes a signiﬁcant process at highly relativistic ener-
gies. Remarkably this process was suﬃciently important
to enable the synthesis of atomic antihydrogen using the
low-energy antiproton ring at CERN. A beam of fast an-
tiprotons impacting on a xenon gas target [1] led to pair
production with positron capture. Theory had predicted
[2,3] that cross sections for CPP would increase with en-
ergy, and indeed this has been veriﬁed experimentally
[4–6] . In fact, this process eventually becomes the domi-
nant mechanism for charge exchange in highly-relativistic
atomic collisions [6]. As well as being an interesting area
of study in its own right, this process has important ap-
plications in the physics of heavy ion colliders such as the
large-hadron collider (LHC) and the relativistic heavy-
ion collider (RHIC) [7]. The process of CPP will lead to
depletion of the charge state of the beam and hence a
loss in luminosity of the collider. For typical operating
conditions of such facilities, these losses might amount to
50% [7] or more.

Although the process is strongly coupled at high en-
ergy, simulations based on relativistic coupled-channel
calculations [8,9] have indicated that leading-order per-
turbation theory is adequate for total cross section esti-
mates for energies (E) up to 150 GeV/u [6]. Nonetheless
in the energy range E ∼ 1 GeV/u where reliable exper-
imental data exist, theory and experiment have been in
least agreement. It is this region which we address in this
paper.

It is now some thirteen years since Becker and co-
workers [10–12] obtained the ﬁrst estimates of cross sec-

1

tions for pair creation with simultaneous capture of the
electron into the K-shell of one of the colliding ions.
However with the exception of Deco and Rivarola, who
gave a two-center description of the continuum positron
[13], two somewhat artiﬁcial modes of reaction have been
distinguished and treated separately when modeling this
process: excitation from the negative energy continuum
of an ion to one of its bound states [2,11,14] or transfer to
a bound state of the other ion [15,16]. Such approaches,
while suited to circumstances in which one ion is much
more highly charged than the other, lack symmetry and
make a distinction between two separate modes of CPP.
They lead to diﬀerent formulae within ﬁrst-order pertur-
bation theory [15] and hence diﬀerent projectile charge
(ZP ), target charge (ZT ) and E dependencies. As a re-
sult theoretical estimates of the asymptotic (E → ∞)
energy dependence of the total cross sections are not in
agreement, with estimates of [2,3]: σCPP ∼ ln(E), and
more recently [15]: σCPP ∼ E2. The former is based on
the positron-electron pair being created around the same
ion, the latter assuming that the pair is divided between
the two ions. Of course both pathways will interfere and
contribute to the process, thus pointing to the necessity
of a two-center treatment for the positron and electron.
It has been shown [13] that the two-center description is
essential in obtaining the correct positron emission spec-
trum and accurate total cross section for CPP. Leading-
order perturbation theory (the ﬁrst Born approximation)
does give reasonably good estimates for the cross section
in the high-energy region (E ∼ 150 GeV/u) [6] for colli-
sions of heavy ions, and has been a reliable model for fast
collisions of light ions with low Z targets in the process
of antihydrogen formation involving CPP by antiprotons
[1,17].

Experimental results for highly relativistic heavy ions
on a variety of targets [7] support the simple scaling law
derived from the virtual-photon method (Born approxi-
mation) which included multiple scattering from the pro-
jectile ion [2] alone: σCPP ∼ Z 2
T , for a given energy. At
lower energies this is not the case [5,18,19], the ZT de-
pendence is more complex, showing an enhancement in
excess of the Z 2
T -scaling. In this paper we propose a re-
ﬁnement of the Born approximation to take into account
higher-order scattering processes. In particular we tackle
the question of the two-center nature of the continuum
positron and the polarization of the captured electron.
We ﬁnd both these eﬀects are vital and lead to theoreti-
cal results which are in accord with experiment. We dis-
cuss the physical explanation for scaled cross section en-

hancement and provide numerical estimates which agree
very well with experiment in qualitative and quantitative
terms.

Through crossing symmetries the leading-order matrix
element for the pair production process, in which the
electron is captured by the projectile P ,

P + T → (P, e−) + T + e+

(1)

is the same as that for the related reaction, e−+P +T →
(P, e−) + T , which is mathematically equivalent to the
time-reversed ionization process

(P, e−) + T → e− + P + T.

(2)

In each crossing symmetry the equivalence relies on the
electron-positron interaction being much weaker than
their interactions with the highly-charged ions; a reason-
T , t′ be the space and
able assumption. Let rP , t and r′
time coordinates of the electron in the projectile and tar-
get frames, respectively. The nuclei follow straight-line
paths with relative velocity v. The Hamiltonian, in the
projectile frame of reference and in atomic units, is given
by:

FIG. 2. Scaled cross sections, σCPP/Z 2

T in microbarns, for
pair-production with electron capture by fully stripped Lan-
thanum ions (La57+) striking thin foils of Copper (ZT = 29),
Silver (ZT = 47) and Gold (ZT = 79). Comparison with
RCDWEIS theory for capture to the 1s-state.

We compare our results for the Relativistic First Born
(R1B), projectile centered, approximation, in which the
initial and ﬁnal state distortions are neglected, and the
Relativistic Distorted Wave Born (RDWB) approxima-
tion [13], where the two-center positron wavefunction is
used but the initial state distortion is omitted. The Born
approximation, which assumes that the positron is in the
continuum of only one of the ions, is ambiguous. The
Born approximation of Bertulani and Baur [2] assumes
the positron to be a projectile-centered wavefunction,
while the Born approximation of Eichler [15] takes the
positron to be centered around the target. These two
models can be viewed as approximations to the wave-
function (20) in which ω′
T = 0 and ωP = 0, respectively.
By retaining both scattering center contributions the in-
terference eﬀects are taken into account. In comparing
RDWB and R1B, it is known that these two-center in-
terference eﬀects reduce the cross section for CPP in the
relativistic domain [13]. This suppression of CPP is the
converse of the two-center enhancement (capture to the
continuum) that arises in ion-atom ionization [20] and is
analogous to the eﬀect of the Fermi function for β± decay
[21].

Using the Fourier transform method [20] we deﬁne

T (η) = γvZ db exp(−iη · b)A(b),

(22)

where T (η) is a product of single-center integrals. The
total cross section is obtained from the integral over the
ejectile momentum (or velocity) and takes the form:

σCPP = Xspins

2π(γv)2 Z c

eZ π

dθ sin θZ dη|T (η)|2.

(23)

where we sum over all the spin states of the electron and
positron pair.

In order to compute CPP cross sections (1) we note
that a positron with energy ǫ+ and momentum p+ trav-
eling forward in time in the ﬁnal state is equivalent to
an electron with energy −ǫ+ and momentum −p+ in the
initial state. Thus we must take:

ve → −v+
ǫf → −ǫ+

e → −v′
v′
+
f → −ǫ′
ǫ′
+.

(24)

The experiments of Belkacem et al. [5,18,19] were
for fully stripped Lanthanum ions (La57+) striking thin
foils of Copper (ZT = 29), Silver (ZT = 47) and
Gold (ZT = 79). The collision energies were E =
0.405, 0.956 and 1.300 GeV/u. The two graphs pre-
sented compare the scaled total cross sections (σCPP/Z 2
T )
given by theory and experiment. Consider ﬁgure 1 which
compares R1B and RDWB with the measurements. Of
course, the scaled R1B curve is independent of ZT , and it
clearly shows the increase in importance of CPP with in-
creasing collision energy. Considering the RDWB model
however, we see a progressive reduction in the scaled cross
section as ZT increases. This is in agreement with the
ﬁndings of Deco and Rivarola [13], who reported a de-
crease in the size of the singly diﬀerential cross sections
by an order of magnitude. Their model is essentially
our RDWB approximation. While this model shows ZT
dependence for the scaled cross section, the trends and
absolute values are incorrect. It predicts a suppression of
the scaled cross section rather than an enhancement as
ZT increases. Thus the RDWB theory data for Gold
gives the lowest scaled cross-section while experiment
shows that it should be the highest. The same incorrect
trend was obtained by the target-centered Born approx-
imation [15].

In contrast (ﬁgure 2) the equivalent results for RCD-
WEIS show the observed enhancement with increasing

ZT . However the theoretical data lie below the experi-
ment for the more energetic collisions. In comparing with
experiment we have only presented simulations for the
dominant channel; capture to the 1s ground state. At
very high energies capture to excited states is thought
to contribute ∼ 30% to the total capture cross section
[6,22]. This would partly explain the diﬀerences between
our theory results and the experimental data. These re-
sults are a great improvement on the R1B approximation
and are consistent with the experimental data.

Other experimental results are available for the impact
of faster and more highly charged beams: 10.8 GeV/u
Au79+ [7] and 0.956 GeV/u U92+ [4] for the same tar-
gets. The Gold beam results (table I) indicate that the
Z 2
T dependence is established at the higher energies, as
predicted by the simple projectile-centered Born approx-
imation [10]. Even at this higher energy our theoretical
results (table I) show an enhancement in excess of Z 2
T .
The experiment is in much better accord with the ﬂat
scaled cross section data given by the Born approxima-
tion [10].

Finally we note that for very large charges, for ex-
ample U92+, the semirelativistic approximations for the
wavefunctions are not valid. Qualitatively this can lead
to underestimation of the cross sections for high charges
when using approximate wavefunctions [11,15]. In such
cases, Coulomb-Dirac wavefunctions are required in or-
der to model the process [11].

In summary, we have proposed and tested a new dis-
torted wave model which incorporates and reduces to ap-
proximations used previously to describe CPP. We con-
ﬁrm that, as has previously been shown [13], the inclusion
of distortions from both ions on the positron continuum
state leads to a reduction in the cross sections. However
including distortion of the bound electron leads to an
increase in the total cross sections and a more accurate
ﬁt to the experimental data for fully-stripped relativis-
tic Lanthanum ions. This improvement in results when
including distortions demonstrates once more the neces-
sity of a two-center treatment for an accurate theoretical
description of this reaction. However our cross section
predictions for faster and more highly charged Gold ions
do not accord with the experimental data which show a
Z 2
T dependence. While the reﬁnements introduced in our
model are signiﬁcant theoretical improvements, clearly
there still exist several unresolved important diﬀerences
between theory and experiment.

Three-body recombination of identical, spin-polarized fermionic atoms in the ultracold limit is
investigated. The mechanisms for recombination are described in terms of the “scattering volume”
Vp in the framework of the adiabatic hyperspherical representation. We have calculated numerically
the recombination rate K3 as a function of Vp and have found that K3 scales as |Vp|8/3 for small
|Vp|. A comparison with experimental data is also presented.

Recently, the quantum degenerate regime was attained
in ultracold gases of fermionic atoms such as 40K [1] and
6Li [2, 3]. Part of the motivation for these experiments is
to observe a pairing of fermions, leading to a superﬂuid
state. One important factor limiting the achievable den-
sity in these degenerate Fermi gases (DFG’s) of trapped
atoms is the loss of atoms through three-body recom-
bination. Such losses occur when three atoms scatter
to form a molecular bound state and a third atom —
K2 + K, for instance. The kinetic energy of
K + K + K
the ﬁnal state particles causes them to escape from the
trapping potential.

While ultracold three-body recombination of identical,
spin-polarized bosons has been theoretically studied be-
cause of its importance for Bose-Einstein condensates,
recombination of identical fermions has not yet been con-
sidered. For bosons, Fedichev et al. [4] predicted that the
recombination rate K3 grows with the two-body s-wave
a4
s, for as > 0. This
scattering length as, namely K3
scaling was later conﬁrmed by Nielsen and Macek [5] who
also pointed out that it should hold for negative as. The
s scaling law for both signs of as was indeed obtained
a4
by Esry et al. [6], Bedaque et al. [7], and Braaten and
Hammer [8].

∝

In the case of fermions, however, the Pauli exclusion
principle prohibits s-wave scattering of atoms in identi-
cal spin states, thus leaving only p-wave collisions. The
relevant low-energy scattering parameter in this case is
the two-body p-wave “scattering volume” deﬁned as

Vp =

lim
k→0

−

tan δp(k)
k3

,

(1)

where δp(k) is the p-wave scattering phase shift and k is
the wave number. The scattering volume Vp is related to
the p-wave scattering length ap (see, for instance, Ref. [9])
by Vp = a3
p. We choose Vp, rather than ap, as the pa-
rameter to characterize the three-body recombination of
fermions since an artiﬁcial nonanalyticity is introduced
into ap when taking the cube root of the quantity in the
right-hand side of Eq. (1).

Even though recombination of identical fermions is
suppressed at ultracold temperatures by the Pauli princi-

ple, it does not vanish. In fact, it has been shown that the
rate is proportional to E2 at low collision energies [12].
While this rate remains negligible under typical experi-
mental conditions, it can become substantial near a Fesh-
bach resonance. The E2 threshold law no longer applies,
and the recombination rate tends to the limit imposed by
unitarity — often comparable to or larger than the rates
for boson systems. Feshbach resonances are, of course,
extremely useful tools for the experimentalist, so under-
standing the behavior near such a resonance is crucial.
So far, such resonances have been observed, for exam-
ple, in systems of 40K [10] and 6Li [2]. This resonant
tuning was also observed for other alkali species in BEC
experiments [11].

This Letter treats the three-body recombination of
identical, spin-polarized fermions in the ultracold limit.
We examine the recombination rate K3 as a function
of the scattering volume Vp by numerically solving the
three-body scattering problem. First of all, since the
atoms are spin polarized and thus in a completely sym-
metric spin state, the spatial wave function must be com-
pletely antisymmetric in order to satisfy the Pauli prin-
ciple. This fact, combined with the generalization of
Wigner’s threshold law to K3, shows that the J Π = 1+
symmetry dominates at threshold, where J is the total
orbital angular momentum and Π is the parity of the sys-
tem. It follows that the recombination rate depends on
the collision energy E as E2 near threshold [12]. (The
same analysis applied to the boson case yields the fa-
miliar result that the recombination rate is constant at
threshold due to the 0+ symmetry.) Therefore, we con-
sider only the 1+ case. Dimensional analysis, together
8/3 scaling of the recom-
with this E2 law, suggests a
bination rate K3 as opposed to the a4
s scaling for bosons.
The interaction potential used is a sum of triplet two-
body potentials, i.e. V = v(r12) + v(r23) + v(r31). This
choice is appropriate for fully spin-polarized atoms that
collide in a quartet electronic state. For simplicity, we
model the two-body potential as either

The former potential has proven convenient in recombi-
nation calculations while the latter has a more physical
van der Waal’s tail with C6 = r6
0D. Ideally, the results
will not depend on the particular potential used in the ul-
tracold limit. The parameter r0 controls the range of the
potential. The coeﬃcient D, representing the potential
depth, is treated as an adjustable parameter that per-
mits us to control the scattering volume Vp, thus mim-
icking the tuning ability of an external magnetic ﬁeld.
This coeﬃcient also economizes the calculations substan-
tially since it allows us to reduce the number of two-body
bound states without sacriﬁcing the ultracold physics.

The two-body p-wave scattering volume Vp behaves
much like the s-wave scattering length as a function of the
parameter D, displaying a tangent-like structure. As D
becomes more negative and the potential becomes more
attractive, the scattering volume passes through a pole
and changes sign each time the potential becomes deep
enough to support one additional p-wave bound state.
For simplicity, we consider the parameter range for which
there exists only one two-body bound state.

The details of the theoretical methods we employ are
more completely discussed in Ref. [13], so only a brief out-
line is given here. We use the adiabatic hyperspherical
representation with modiﬁed Smith-Whitten hyperspher-
ical coordinates. Simply put, hyperspherical coordinates
transform the six relative Cartesian coordinates in the
center of mass frame to a set with a single length co-
ordinate, the hyperradius R, and ﬁve hyperangles. The
hyperradius can thus be thought of as characterizing the
overall size of the three-body system. These coordinates
also allow us to easily impose the correct permutation
symmetry on the wave functions. Solution of the adia-
batic equation yields adiabatic hyperspherical potential
curves and channel functions. The coupled hyperradial
equations are then solved using an R-matrix propagation
method.

The adiabatic hyperspherical representation reduces
the collision of the three atoms to dynamics on a set
of coupled hyperradial adiabatic potentials. These po-
tentials bear a strong resemblance to standard molecular
Born-Oppenheimer potentials (see Fig. 1) and can be in-
terpreted in much the same way. The lowest potential
curve in the ﬁgure, for instance, correlates to a bound
molecule and a free atom far away. Because the atoms
are identical fermions, the molecule has unit angular mo-
mentum and the potential has a centrifugal barrier. Fur-
ther, because we consider only the 1+ symmetry due to
its dominance at threshold, the free atom must also be in
a p-wave relative to the center of mass of the molecule.
All of the other curves in Fig. 1 correlate to three free

atoms. In fact, there are an inﬁnite number of potential
curves associated with three-body continuum channels
and approach the three-body breakup threshold U = 0
asymptotically.

Three-body recombination can be seen as a transition
from one three-body continuum channel to the recombi-
nation channel, driven by nonadiabatic coupling. Qual-
itatively, the adiabatic potentials shown in Fig. 1 dis-
play analogous behavior, as functions of Vp, as the adia-
batic potentials for bosons show as functions of as [6, 17]
For both systems, the entrance channel goes from be-
ing strongly repulsive for positive Vp and as to having
an attractive well behind a potential barrier for nega-
tive values. The entrance channel for the fermions is
generally more repulsive, however, than the addition of
a simple J=1 centrifugal potential term to the boson
curves would give due to permutation symmetry consid-
erations [12]. The recombination channels are also very
similar, although it should be noted that there is no Eﬁ-
mov eﬀect [14] for fermions in the limit
. Eﬁ-
mov physics plays a key role in the interpretation of the
ultracold recombination of bosons [6].

Vp| → ∞
|

The primary diﬀerence between fermion and boson sys-
tems lies in the nonadiabatic coupling. While it is still
similar for negative Vp and as, for positive values the
similarities end. Where the coupling strength for bosons
shows a deﬁnite peak whose position increases linearly
in as, the coupling strength for fermions remains peaked
at small R with a slowly decaying shoulder whose ex-
1/3
tent grows in proportion to V
. For negative values of
p
Vp, we thus expect that the fermion recombination rate
can show resonant enhancement due to three-body shape
resonances just as for bosons, but we do not expect an
inﬁnite series of such resonances since this was a conse-
quence of the Eﬁmov eﬀect. We have not, however, seen
in our calcula-
evidence of such resonances as Vp → −∞
tions.

To calculate the three-body recombination rate, we

solve the hyperradial equations [13] for potentials like
those shown in Fig. 1. The numerical hyperradial wave
functions are matched to the appropriate Bessel func-
tions based upon the known form of the long-range poten-
tials [13]. The S-matrix is obtained and the generalized
cross section for three-body recombination is calculated:

indices λ and f label initial three-body continuum and
ﬁnal recombination channels, respectively. As it turns
out, the numerical prefactor in Eq. (4) — which is de-
termined by permutation symmetry — is the same as for
three identical bosons [6] (recall that we are considering
the J π = 1+ symmetry). The event rate constant per
atomic triad is then deﬁned simply as K3 = ~k
µ σ. This
quantity is related to the atom-loss rate constant L3 by
L3 = 3K3/6 [6].

Because the rate depends strongly on the collision en-
ergy in the ultracold regime, it must be thermally aver-
aged in order to compare with experimental data. Fol-
lowing Ref. [16], we have derived the thermally averaged
recombination rate constant to be

factors of r0 were included based on general arguments
of length scale invariance of the Schr¨odinger equation.
Because the two-body potentials in Eqs. (2)–(3) depend
only on the combination rij /r0, r0 can be deﬁned to be
the new length scale for both the two-body and three-
body systems. This new length scale implies multiplying
−1
energies and temperatures by r2
0 , and the
−4
rate by r
0 . The energy parameter D in our model —
which controls Vp — is independent of the length scale,
and so its scaled counterpart, r2
0D, can be used to control
Vp/r3
0. Having calculated the rate as a function of Vp and
energy for a ﬁxed r0, we can thus obtain the rate for any
other value of r0 by means of the above scaling. The key
is that at a ﬁxed laboratory collision energy (or temper-
ature), changing r0 eﬀectively changes the range of the
two-body potential, and the new rate corresponds to the
rate at the scaled energy r2
0E. One has to be careful,
of course, to track the simultaneous change in the scaled
Vp.

rate was obtained on a relatively dense set of Vp values.
The diamonds denote the rates resulting from the second

which are qualitatively very diﬀerent — show reasonable
quantitative agreement, especially for the more experi-
mentally relevant thermally averaged rate. The poorest

a diﬀerent value of r0 and the same lab energy E were
plotted here, it would look systematically diﬀerent, al-
though qualitatively similar. This apparent dependence
on the two-body potential would seem to argue against
a “universal” curve as was found for bosons [5, 6, 7, 8].
Based on the above length scaling arguments, though, it
is clear that the scaled rate curves — at the same scaled
energy — are what should be compared between diﬀer-
ent potentials and would thus come closest to a universal
curve.

higher energies. The fact that the scaling breaks down
for K3(E) is an indication that the ﬁxed collision energy
is no longer in the threshold regime.

For large positive scattering volumes Vp, the collision
energy eventually becomes large compared to the dimer
binding energy, and K3 increases more slowly than the

8/3 scaling law. Recalling that for negative Vp there is

a barrier in the initial adiabatic hyperspherical potential,
the breakdown in the scaling law comes when the barrier
sinks below the collision energy at large negative Vp. The
fact that the recombination rate increases more rapidly
than the scaling law with increasing

the more ready tunneling through the barrier. The rate
continues to increase until it reaches the limit imposed
by unitarity, namely (in SI units)

This value is obtained from Eq. (4) by assuming that

this limit will be reached when

This peak disappears and reappears as a function of col-
lision energy since the phase diﬀerence between the two
pathways depends on the energy.

In Fig. 3, we compare our calculations with experi-
mental measurements of the recombination rate of three
40K atoms all in the
spin state near a p-wave
7/2
two-body Feshbach resonance. The theoretical rates are
calculated at T = 2.5 µK, while the experimental tem-
perature varies between 2 and 3 µK. The ﬁgure shows
the rates as functions of the magnetic ﬁeld strength B.
The Feshbach resonance lies at B0 = 198.5 G; Vp is posi-
tive for B below the resonance and negative for B above.
Treating r0 as a ﬁtting parameter, we obtain the solid line
shown in the ﬁgure. The agreement on the rise of the res-
onance (Vp >0) is better than on the fall (Vp <0). The
disagreement away from the resonance is likely due to
the breakdown of the experimental assumption of purely
three-body loss in determining the rate coeﬃcient. Near
the resonance, however, our theoretical rates between one
and two orders of magnitude lower. In fact, for all values
of r0, the theoretical values lie below the experimental
ones. This discrepancy is not surprising given that we
included only a single partial wave (1+) in our calcula-
tion. While this symmetry controls the limiting behav-
ior at threshold, it is not necessarily dominant near the
resonant peak. In fact, limited explorations have demon-
strated that other J π can be comparable to 1+ at the res-
onance peak. The contributions from these higher partial
waves accumulate quickly since thermal averaging, from
Eq. (5), gives an extra factor of roughly (J + 2)!.

In summary, we have investigated ultracold three-body
recombination of identical spin-polarized fermions and
have numerically calculated the recombination rate as a

study that we are aware of, and much remains to be un-
derstood about these fermion systems. Moreover, with
some slight modiﬁcations to our numerical method, it is
possible to treat systems with only two identical parti-
cles. Three-body recombination of such systems plays an
important role in experiments on mixed-spin state Fermi
gases and mixed Bose-Fermi gases.

Abstract. Fully numerical mesh solutions of 2D and 3D quantum equations of
Schr¨odinger and Hartree-Fock type allow us to work with wavefunctions which pos-
sess a very ﬂexible geometry. This ﬂexibility is especially important for calculations
of atoms and molecules in strong external ﬁelds where neither the external ﬁeld nor
the internal interactions can be considered as a perturbation. In the framework of this
method we present various approaches to calculations of quasi-steady states of these
systems in strong electric ﬁelds. These approaches are aimed at obtaining precise com-
plex wavefunctions and corresponding eigenvalues in the form E = E0 − iΓ/2, where
E0 is the real part of the energy and the value Γ/2 determines the lifetime of the state
in relation to escape of electrons from the system. The applications for single-electron
systems include correct solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for the H+
2 ion (energies
and decay rates) and the hydrogen atom in strong parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
Some results for the helium atom in strong electric ﬁelds are announced.

I

INTRODUCTION

During the latter decade the interest to theoretical studies of atoms and molecules
in strong external ﬁelds was strongly motivated by experiments with intense laser
beams (electromagnetic ﬁelds with dominating electric component) and astronom-
ical observations of white dwarfs and neutron stars (magnetic ﬁelds). The exper-
imental availability of extremely strong electric ﬁelds in laser beams makes the
theoretical study of various atomic and molecular species under such conditions
very desirable. The properties of atomic and molecular systems in strong ﬁelds
undergo dramatic changes in comparison with the ﬁeld-free case. These changes

are associated with the strong distortions of the spatial distributions of the elec-
tronic density and correspondingly the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions.
This complex geometry is diﬃcult for its description by means of traditional sets
of basis functions and requires more ﬂexible approaches which can, in particular,
be provided by multi-dimensional mesh ﬁnite-diﬀerence methods.

Many results of the experiments with intense laser beams can be considered from
the point of view of the behaviour of atoms and molecules in intense static electric
ﬁelds, especially when the frequency of the radiation is low. (The low-frequency
behaviour and the limits of this region are analysed by [1]).

The most advanced theoretical studies of eﬀects in strong electric ﬁelds were tra-
ditionally concentrated on a hydrogen atom. Other atomic and molecular systems
in strong electric ﬁelds are much less studied. Many sophisticated theoretical meth-
ods developed for the hydrogen atom cannot be simply applied for other atoms and
molecules. This circumstance is an argument for development of more universal
theoretical and computational methods for atoms and molecules in strong electric
ﬁelds.

Quasi-steady states of hydrogen atoms in strong electric ﬁelds were studied pre-
cisely in many theoretical works (see [2–11] and references therein). Some of
these works are based on separation of variables in parabolic coordinates in the
Schr¨odinger equation for the hydrogen atom. This separation of spatial variables
for atomic and molecular systems in external electric ﬁelds is possible only for one-
electron atoms with the Coulomb electron-nucleus interaction. Non-hydrogenic
systems or systems with non-Coulomb interaction do not allow this separation
of variables. Their theoretical studies require a developed technique of solving the
Schr¨odinger and similar equations with non-separable variables. One of the possible
ways for solution of this problem consists in the application of mesh computational
methods for solving these equations. The mathematical problem consists here in so-
lution of partial diﬀerential equations for systems with discrete quasi-steady states
lying on the background of the continuous spectrum.

In the ﬁrst part of this work we present applications of our mesh method for
solving Schr¨odinger equations with non-separable variables for quasi-steady states.
The method is based on the technique of a mesh numerical solution of Schr¨odinger
and Hartree-Fock equations with non-separable variables for steady states [12–17].
The most of the applications for the discrete states was focused on atoms in strong
magnetic ﬁelds [14–20]. In this paper we present computational approaches which
we have developed for quasi-steady states in external electric ﬁelds [21–23] and
apply them to several single electron systems. At the end of the paper we announce
some of results of our current work on the helium atom in strong electric ﬁelds.

the formula E = Ee + 1/R.

Our two-dimensional mesh computational method which we apply for obtain-
ing eigenvalues of the Hamiltonians (1) and (2) in the form suﬃcient for case of
stationary states (i.e F = 0) of single-electron systems is described in refs. [13,14].
For these systems highly precisely solutions can be obtained by solving Schr¨odinger
equations in ﬁnite spatial domains Ω (with simple boundary conditions ψ|∂Ω = 0
or ∂ψ/∂n|∂Ω = 0) with negligible errors for domains of reasonable dimensions (see
analytical estimations of errors in ref. [14] and results of numerical experiments
in ref. [13]). When employing the Richardson’s extrapolation of the energy values
to the inﬁnitely small mesh step h → 0 very precise results can be obtained on
uniform meshes with relatively small numbers of nodes [13,14]. Two important
problems have been solved for the following development of the multi-dimensional
Hartree-Fock method for many-electron systems: 1. An enhancement of the pre-
cision of single-electron wavefunctions due to their more complicated geometry in
comparison with the one-electron case, and 2. Obtaining correct mesh represen-
tations of Coulomb and exchange potentials. The ﬁrst of these problems can be
solved more or less simply by means of non-uniform meshes with the distribution of

nodes concentrated near the nuclei. The second and most complicated problem was
initially solved in our ﬁrst works on the helium atom in magnetic ﬁelds [15,16] by
means of a direct summation over the mesh nodes. But this direct method is very
expensive with respect to the computing time and due to this reason we obtained
in the following works [17–20] these potentials as solutions of the corresponding
Poisson equations. The problem of the boundary conditions for a Poisson equation
as well as the problem of simultaneously solving Poisson equations on the same
meshes with Schr¨odinger-like equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ) has been
discussed in ref. [16].

The simultaneous solution of the Poisson equations for the Coulomb and ex-
change potentials and the Schr¨odinger-like equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ)
is a complicated problem due to a diﬀerent asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunc-
tions and potentials. The wavefunctions of the bound electrons decrease exponen-
tially as r → ∞ (r is the distance from the origin). This simpliﬁes the problem
of the solution of equations for wavefunctions in the inﬁnite space because it is
possible either to solve these equations in a ﬁnite domain Ω (as described above)
or otherwise to solve these equations in the inﬁnite space on meshes with expo-
nentially growing distances between nodes as r → ∞. On the contrary, solutions
of Poisson equations for non-zero sums of charges decrease as 1/r as r → ∞. In
result, every spatial restriction of the domain Ω introduces a signiﬁcant error into
the ﬁnal solution. In our approach we address the above problems by using special
forms of non-uniform meshes [17]. Solutions to the Poisson equation on separate
meshes contain some errors δP associated with an inaccurate description of the
potential far from the nucleus. However, due to the special form of the function
δP (˜h) for these meshes (where ˜h is a formal mesh step) the errors do not show up
in the ﬁnal results for the energy and other physical quantities, which we obtain
by means of the Richardson extrapolation procedure (polynomial extrapolation to
h = 0 [13,14]). The main requirement for these meshes is a polynomial increase
of the actual mesh step h(r) when r → ∞. Moreover, this behaviour can be only
linear one, i.e. h−1(r) = O(1/r) as r → ∞. The error of the mesh solution in this
case has the form of a polynomial of the formal step of the mesh ˜h = 1/N, where
N is the number of nodes along one of the coordinates. In practical calculations
these meshes are introduced by means of an orthogonal coordinate transformation
from the physical coordinates xp to the mathematical ones xm made separately for
ρ and z. The numerical solution is, in fact, carried out on uniform meshes in the
mathematical coordinates xm. The characteristic feature of these meshes consists
of rapidly increasing coordinates of several outermost nodes when increasing the
total number of nodes and decreasing the actual mesh step in the vicinity of the
origin.

The methods described above for the two-dimensional case can be applied also

to three-dimensional Schr¨odinger and Hartree-Fock problems [24,25].

III QUASISTATIONARY STATES

The most common approach to the mathematical description of the quasista-
tionary states of quantum systems consists in employment of the complex form of
the energy eigenvalues

E = E0 − iΓ/2

where the real part of the energy E0 is the centre of the band corresponding to
a quasistationary state and the imaginary part Γ/2 is the half-width of the band
which determines the lifetime of the state.
In this approach one may consider
quasistationary states of quantum systems similarly to the stationary ones. For
systems (1) and (2) at F > 0 the electron can leave the system in the direction of
positive z and the behaviour of the wavefunction on this semi-axis determines the
main features of the behaviour in the external electric ﬁeld F . The mathematical
problem consists in the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation

Hψ = Eψ

(3)

at F > 0 for resonance states which are inheritors of some discrete (at F = 0) states.
The wavefunctions of these states must describe the process of separation of the
electron from the system. These wavefunctions can be distinguished either by the
explicit establishing the boundary condition of the outgoing wave or by means of a
complex coordinate transformation. The latter transforms the oscillating outgoing
wave into an exponentially decreasing wavefunction for which the simple Dirichlet
boundary condition ψ → 0 as z → +∞ can be established.
From the mathematical point of view the problem under consideration consists in
obtaining solutions of the single-particle Schr¨odinger equation for this electron with

FIGURE 1. The potential energy for the hydrogen atom V (ρ = 0, z) in the external uniform
electric ﬁeld.

the correct asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction as an outgoing wave. Cur-
rently we have three diﬀerent possibilities for obtaining solutions with the outgoing
wave asymptotics realised in our computational program:

1. Complex boundary condition method. This method is described in detail in
ref. [16,22]. The method is based on the idea that the single-electron Schr¨odinger
equation for a ﬁnite system can be solved with the arbitrary precision in a ﬁnite
area both for stationary and for quasi-stationary eigenstates. The case of stationary
states is considered in [13,14]. We discuss the approach for the quasi-stationary
states following ref. [22]. Figure 1 presents the potential curve for the simplest
Hamiltonian (1). Analogously to [14,27] the calculations can be carried out in
an area Ω which is ﬁnite along the direction z. For the coordinate z we have
used uniform meshes. The boundary of the area z = −Lz− for z < 0 (F ≥ 0)
(Figure 1) is determined from the condition of small values of the wavefunction on
the boundary and, therefore, small perturbations introduced by the corresponding
boundary condition [14]. The values of the wavefunction on the opposite boundary
of the area (z = Lz+) cannot be excluded from the consideration. We consider
non-stationary states corresponding to the process when an electron leaves the
system in the direction z → +∞. Thus, an outgoing wave boundary condition
is to be established on z = Lz+. The form of this boundary condition can be
derived from the asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction for z → +∞. In this
limit the asymptotics of the real system can be replaced by the asymptotics of
the wavefunction of a free electron in the uniform electric ﬁeld. Solutions of the
Schr¨odinger equation for this system can be written as

ψ(z) = AM(ξ)e−iΘ(ξ),

ξ = (cid:18)z +

E

F(cid:19) (2F )1/3

(4)

where M(ξ) and Θ(ξ) are the modulus and phase of the Airy function, A is a
constant [26]. The asymptotics of ψ for z → +∞ can be obtained from eqs.

edge of the region

(7)

This approximate boundary condition is derived from the asymptotics of the wave-
function of a free electron in a uniform electric ﬁeld and in the limit Lz+ → +∞ can
be considered as exact one. On the other hand, our numerical experiments show,
that errors caused by the approximate nature of this asymptotics are important
only for very short regions Ω. Solving the Schr¨odinger equation with the bound-
ary condition (7) established on a reasonable distances Lz+ from the origin of the
system one obtains precise complex eigenvalues of the energy and corresponding
wavefunctions.

This straightforward approach enables obtaining precise results both for atoms
and molecules from weak to moderate strong ﬁelds (for instance for the ground
state of the hydrogen atom up to F = 0.20 − 0.25 a.u.). For stronger ﬁelds the
precision of this method is limited by the precision of the mesh representation of
the boundary condition (7).

2. Classical complex rotation of the coordinate z in the form z → zeiΘ. Oppo-
site to the boundary condition approach, this method does not require establishing
boundary conditions dependent on the energy and can be used with the zero bound-
ary conditions for the wavefunction. This simpliﬁcation is especially important for
applications to multi-electron systems. In this approach we have obtained precise
results for atomic systems in strong ﬁelds from the lower bound of the over-barrier
regime up to super-strong ﬁelds corresponding to regime |ReE| << |ImE| [23]. For
atoms in weak ﬁelds the applicability of the method is limited by numerical errors
in the imaginary part of the energy. On the other hand, this method cannot be
immediately applied to molecular systems in our direct mesh approach [23,28].

3. Exterior complex transformation of the coordinate z. The exterior complex
scaling [28] combines many advantages of the boundary condition and complex

FIGURE 2. The integration paths for the complex coordinate z. Dashed line is the path at the
traditional rotation z → zeiΩ. Solid line is the path corresponded to the exterior curved path

rotation method. In its initial form [28] it consists in the complex rotation of a
coordinate e.g. r around a point r0 lying in the exterior part of the system, i.e.

r → r0 + (r − r0)eiΘ for

r ≥ r0

(8)

and leaves intact the Hamiltonian in the internal part of the system. The latter
circumstance allows us to employ this transformation both for atoms and molecules
in arbitrary electric ﬁelds. In addition this transformation does not contain energy-
dependent boundary conditions as well as the classical complex rotation. On
the other hand, the exterior complex scaling being introduced into our numeri-
cal scheme in the form (8) leads to the same numerical problems at very strong
ﬁelds as well as the boundary condition method due to the nonanalytic behaviour
of this transformation at the point r0 (or z0 in our case).

In our numerical approach we solve the latter problem by means of a transfor-
mation of the real coordinate z into a smooth curved path in the complex plane z
(Figure 2, see details in [23]). This transformation leaves intact the Hamiltonian
in the internal part of the system, but supplies the complex rotation of z (and the
possibility to use the zero asymptotic boundary conditions for the wavefunction) in
the external part of the system without any loss of analycity. The transformation
can be applied both for atoms and molecules and provides precise results for ﬁelds
from weak up to super-strong including the regime |ReE| << |ImE| [23].
The three methods presented above have diﬀerent but overlapping regions of
their most eﬀective application. This allows their combined using for the recipro-
cal control in applications. The numerical results obtained by all three methods
coincide in the limits of their applicability and are in agreement with numerous
published data on the hydrogen atom in electric ﬁelds (see e.g. [5–8]).

IV SELECTED PHYSICAL RESULTS

Using the boundary condition approach enables one to obtain both the values
of the energy and other observables and the wavefunctions in their mesh represen-
tation. An example of such a wavefunction of the ground state of the hydrogen
molecular ion is presented in Figure 3. The electron energy Ee obtained as a so-
lution of (3), (2) allows one to determine potential curves E(R) for the molecule
as a whole by using the formula E(R) = Ee + 1/R. These potential curves and
corresponding values of Γ/2 are presented in Figure 4. One can see in Figure 4
that when growing electric ﬁeld strength the minimum on the curve E(R) shifts
to the right, becomes more shallow and ﬂat, and at Fc ≈ 0.065 the minimum dis-
appears. The dependence of the location R0 of the minimum on these curves with
corresponding values of the energy E and half-widths of the level are presented in
Table 1. (For comparison, at F = 0 published results for the equilibrium point are
R0 = 1.997193 and E = −0.6026346 [29]. For the potential curve as a whole our
numerical values at F = 0 coincide with data by [30].) One can see in Table 1

and Figure 4 that for the ground state of the hydrogen molecular ion at equilib-
rium internuclear distances there is a marked probability of its decay through the
separation of the electron. Analogous calculations for two excited states 2pπu (the
lowest state with |m| = 1) and 3dδg (the lowest state with |m| = 2) [22] show that
for the ﬁeld strengths at which their potential curves have minima this process has
a low probability.

The critical value of the maximal electric ﬁeld Fc = 0.065a.u. = 3.3V/˚A when
the molecule H+
2 can exist is in a good agreement with experimental results by
Bucksbaum et al [31]. According this work H+
2 molecule may exist in laser beam
ﬁelds with intensity less than 1014W/cm2 which corresponds to 3V/˚A, and does
not exist in more intensive ﬁelds.

beam ﬁelds in works [31–33] were based on conception of deformation of potential
curves which results in coupling of the ground state 1sσg with 2pσu state [32]. This
results in a possibility of rupture of the molecule after absorption some photons.
On the other hand, the results obtained above enable us to analyse this process
from simpler point of view. When the frequency of the radiation is low enough the
consideration of the process as extension and rupture of the molecule in a strong
static electric ﬁeld is a quite adequate model [1,32]. The conception of coupling
states might be substituted by an exact numerical calculation of one (as it was
done above) or several (if several states are considered) dependencies E(R). This
numerical calculation is equivalent to a traditional calculation of the energy of the
state when taking into account coupling with all the states of the same symmetry
(corresponding to the symmetry of the initial physical problem).

The calculations presented above were carried out for the ground state of 2D
In fact, our method is not restricted by these states. Computa-

tional algorithms of our program of atomic and molecular mesh calculations AT-
MOLMESH are constructed so that calculations are being carried out for a state
with prescribed spatial symmetry and with the electron energy nearest to the given
initial approximation Eb. Thus, there is no diﬀerence between calculations for the
ground and for excited states and calculations can be fulﬁlled for various states of
the same spatial symmetry including even degenerate states (when applying some
special technical methods). For instance, potential curves 2sσg and 3dσg of the
ﬁeld-free H+
2 have exact crossing near R = 4.05 [30]. In magnetic ﬁelds parallel
to the molecular axis this pair of states forms an avoided crossing. Our method
permits calculations for both exact and avoided crossings at F = 0 as well as at
F 6= 0 as presented in Figure 5.

Concluding this section we announce some preliminary results on the helium
atom in strong electric ﬁelds. These results are obtained in a multi-conﬁgurational
(CI) mesh calculation. The calculations for separate meshes are analogous to de-
scribed above and are carried out by means of the curved path exterior complex
transformation. Our preliminary results for the ground state of the helium atom
agree with data from recent works [34,35]. Our results for the excited state 21S0
are shown in Figure 6.

V CONCLUSIONS

In this communication we have presented a 2D fully numerical mesh solution
approach to calculations for atoms and simple diatomic molecules in strong ex-
ternal electric and magnetic ﬁelds. For single-electron systems in external electric
ﬁelds we can apply three diﬀerent methods of calculation of the complex energy
eigenvalues for atom-like systems and two methods for molecules. These methods
have diﬀerent but overlapping regions of their most eﬀective application. This al-
lows their combined using for the reciprocal control in applications. The complex
boundary condition method is the most straightforward and is the most reliable
in this sense. For relatively weak ﬁelds it allows obtaining results on the meshes
with the lesser number of nodes than the curved path complex transformation. On
the other hand, the boundary condition method loses its precision and stability at
extremely strong electric ﬁelds and, second, this method contain the energy of the
electron in its formulation. The latter feature can be some obstacle in its applica-
tion to problems more complicated than the single-electron Schr¨odinger equation.
The curved path complex transformation method is the most general of the three
and the most prospective for the following applications. The only shortage of this
method is that this is less precise and less stable for the atom-like systems at
extremely strong electric ﬁelds (|ImE| >> |ReE|) than the traditional complex
rotation. Thus, the latter method is the most convenient for atom-like systems at
such extremely strong ﬁelds.

The mathematical technique developed for solving Schr¨odinger equations for
quasi-steady states allowed us to obtain a series of results for the hydrogen atom in
parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds and for the H+
2 ion in strong electric ﬁelds. The
following applications of these methods are associated with the CI approach which
is now in the process of development and testing on the problem of the helium
atom in strong electric ﬁelds. We present preliminary results for the 21S0 state of
this atom.

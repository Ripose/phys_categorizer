We demonstrate the use of frequency-encoded light masks in neutral atom lithography. We
demonstrate that multiple features can be patterned across a monotonic potential gradient. Features
as narrow as 0.9 µm are fabricated on silicon substrates with a metastable argon beam. Internal
state manipulation with such a mask enables continuously adjustable feature positions and feature
densities not limited by the optical wavelength, unlike previous light masks.

Atom lithography has been used to make lines as small
as 13 nm [1, 2], to fabricate features with aspect ratios
greater than 2:1 [3, 4], and to pattern areas as large
as 38 cm2 [5]. Atoms patterned with light masks are
uniquely well-suited for structured doping [6] and for
fabrication demanding long-range coherence [7]. How-
ever,
feature spacings in light masks have been lim-
ited by the length scale of the optical wavelength used
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In this Letter,
we demonstrate a technique that extends light masks be-
yond the feature density of optical lithography and to
more complex patterns than standing wave interferences.

Research in neutral atom lithography has been moti-
vated by several considerations. Neutral atomic beams
with thermal kinetic energies have short (< .1 nm) de
Broglie wavelengths, minimizing diﬀractive resolution
limitations. Neutral atoms are insensitive to stray elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds, and long-range inter-particle
interactions are weak. A wealth of atom optics (mir-
rors, guides, etc.) have been developed, including light
masks, which, unlike physical masks, do not sag and can-
not be clogged or damaged. Laser-accessible internal
structure of atoms allows eﬃcient cooling, the storage
of internal energy, and complex manipulations. State-
sensitive atom lithography with metastable atoms has
been demonstrated with both positive- and negative-tone
resists capable of sub-10-nm resolution [5, 19, 20].

In this work we encode the desired position distribu-
tion using the frequency, instead of the intensity, of the
light.
In the presence of an appropriate potential gra-
dient, the optical resonant frequency of the atom will
be position-dependent. Thus each spectral component
of a laser beam interacts can interact with the atoms at
a speciﬁc but separate location. The frequency encod-
ing of spatial information is commonly known from mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), where protons (instead
of atoms) are imaged (instead of patterned) in a potential
gradient by radio- (instead of optical-) frequency radia-
tion. We will refer to atom lithography with frequency-
encoded light masks as Atomic Resonance Lithography
(ARL). Thomas and coworkers have developed neutral
atom measurement techniques based on a more direct
analogue to MRI [21, 22].

Frequency encoding has several promising features.

Just as sub-100-µm features can be resolved with 100-
meter wavelength radio waves in MRI, far sub-optical (ie,
sub-micron) features and spacings can be created with
optical resonances in atoms [21, 22, 23]. As shown in
Ref. [23], arbitrary patterns can be frequency-encoded
and generated.
Furthermore, ARL can create two-
dimensional patterns, just as MRI can image two- [24]
or three-dimensional distributions. Finally, frequency-
encoded masks do not demand high transverse coherence
of the incident atoms. By contrast, although intricate
holographic patterns [25, 26, 27] have been detected, the
required coherent sources lack the ﬂux to pattern a sur-
face: experiments have used integrated surface densities
on the order of 109 below a typical lithographic dose.

Figure 1 describes a realization of ARL based on
quenching directly within the potential gradient. First,
metastable argon atoms are optically pumped to the

onance lithography. (a) Argon atoms strike a gold surface
after passing through a sequence of laser beams (not to scale)
propagation parallel to the surface: optical pump OP, shift
S, and quench Q. The light mask selectively quenches some
atoms to their ground state |gi (open circles), in which state
atoms are unable to activate the formation of resist on the
surface. At all other locations, metastable atoms |mi (ﬁlled
circles) activate the grown of carbonaceous resist (a-C) on
the substrate. (b) Level diagram relevant to S and Q. An
on-resonant light shift beam (S) is applied on a cycling tran-
sition between the metastable state |mi and excited state |ei.
Two pairs of detunings (Q1 and Q2, detuned ±δ1 and ±δ2,
respectively) excite atoms to |qi, from which atoms decay, in
a radiative cascade, to the inert ground state |gi.

Not shown is earlier optical quenching of the atoms in
the 4s′[1/2]o

atoms would contribute a background rate of resist for-
mation. Next, the atoms pass through a zone of two over-
lapping beams. A resonant σ+ “shift” beam (S) on the
cycling tran-
812 nm
sition overlaps with a σ− “quench” beam (Q) containing
four frequency components,
δ2. As shown in
Fig. 2a, these frequencies are resonant at two stark shifts
(i.e., four positions) in the resonant shift beam. At these
four positions, atoms are optically pumped by Q to the
true atomic ground state
. Note that two frequencies

(e.g.,

each resonant position because atomic population existed

(as described below), while atoms in

tures – here, stripes of unprotected surface – will appear.

through the light mask with a ﬂux density of 3
×
1012 cm−2 s−1. Because the system is evacuated with
diﬀusion pumps, surfaces within the system are covered
with several monolayers of siloxane hydrocarbons. When
the metastable atoms hit the surface, they transfer their
internal energy to the physisorbed hydrocarbons and in-
duce a chemical change that results in the formation of
a durable material. The resist material remains on the
surface even after exposure to air and/or solution, and
can thus be used as a mask for etching. The beam ap-
paratus and lithographic process used in this work have
been described in more detail elsewhere [5].

A gold substrate was exposed for ﬁve hours through
the optical mask of Fig. 1. The light mask parameters
were as follows. The S beam had 5.9 mW cylindrically
focused to a proﬁle of 46 µm by 925 µm, creating a max-
imum stark shift that was spectroscopically measured
to be 150 MHz. Cylindrically symmetric 110-µm-wide
quench beams Q1 and Q2 each had 70 µW of power, split
40 MHz and

between the pair of detunings,
110 MHz. After exposure, the substrate

Figure 2b shows an optical micrograph of the etched
substrate. At positions where either Q1 or Q2 was res-
onant, metastable atoms were quenched, leaving the un-
derlying substrate unprotected against the subsequent
gold etch. At all other positions, a resist material was
formed as described above, and gold remained on the sil-
icon substrate after etching. A pattern was formed across
2 cm of the substrate. Figure 2b was taken in the cen-

to the light mask. The comparison (indicated by dotted
arrows) to Fig. 2a shows that, as desired, there are four
features: two on each side of the Gaussian intensity pro-
ﬁle of the S beam. We ﬁt the sum of four Lorentzians
to the integrated reﬂectivity proﬁle of the substrate to
determine more precise feature locations and positions.

set of lines was not expected, but could be explained by
aberrations in the cylindrical optics that formed the shift
beam. The lower set of lines are within experimental
error of the expected linewidth of atomic density, 9 µm
(as discussed below), and the expected feature separa-
tion, 27 µm. Note that the transfer function from atomic
ﬂux density to reﬂectivity of the surface after etching is
nonlinear, such that purely atomic calculations may vary
systematically from the observed features.

The signiﬁcance of the result shown in Fig. 2 is that two
lithographic features were created across each monotonic
part of the potential. Unlike previous atom lithographic
results with light masks, the wavelength of light does not
determine the minimum feature separation. The ultimate
resolution of ARL can be limited by a variety of eﬀects,
discussed Refs. [21, 23] and summarized in the following
paragraphs.

The most fundamental limitation is the spectroscopic
precision with which each resonant transfer position is de-
ﬁned, δxsp = ~Γ′/F , where Γ′ is the spectroscopic width
of the transition, and F is the potential gradient. In these

experiments we used laser light to create the potential
gradient, but gradients could also be created with mag-
netic [22] or electric ﬁelds. For the realization of ARL
discussed above, Γ′ is the power-broadened and time-
broadened quenching transition, with a natural linewidth
5 MHz. Experimentally, Γ′ = 2π
Γ = 2π
20 MHz.
For the gradient F/~ = 2π
2.3 MHz/µm at the fea-
ture locations in Fig. 2, we ﬁnd δxsp = 9 µm. Note
that for a Raman transition, as will be considered below,
Γ′ = vL/w0 = 1/τ , where vL = 850 m/s is the longitu-
dinal velocity of the Ar* atoms, w0 is the 1/e2 intensity
waist of the Raman beams, and τ is the atom-light inter-
action time.

Atomic motion during the transfer can also limit the
resolution. While transferring an atom of mass M to a
state with a gradient F , acceleration and diﬀraction limit
the resolution to the order of F τ 2/2M , where τ is again
the transfer time [21]. However, the numerical factors de-
pend on which states are in a gradient and for how long.
In the case where Γ′ is determined by the interaction
time of a Raman transfer, and the pattern is formed by
the atoms transferred to the gradient, one can choose an
1/3
optimal τ to give a resolution of δxℓ = 2 (cid:0)~2/2M F (cid:1)
.
For 40Ar and F/~ = 2π
1 MHz/µm, the optimal size is
δxℓ = 100 nm. This limit is not, however, fundamen-
tal: Olshanii et al.
show that an appropriate choice
of probe frequency variation during atomic transfer (a
“magic phase”) can correct for later evolution, such that
the spectroscopic resolution δxsp is recovered [23].

×

Free ﬂight between the pattern formation and the sub-
strate will allow the atoms to diﬀract further. Given
a free-ﬂight time TF F , the diﬀraction limit is δxdif =
p~TF F /2M. For instance, for TF F = 30Γ−1, this limit
is δxdif = 27 nm, smaller than the other limits given
here. Note that this is a quantitative restatement of
one of the desirable qualities of atoms as a patterning
constituent: their short de Broglie wavelength λdB min-
√λdBD, where D is the mask-
imizes the diﬀraction,
substrate separation.

The collimation of the atomic beam can limit the res-
olution of the pattern. Given an rms velocity spread
vrms(τ + TF F ). For τ + TF F = 30Γ−1 and
vrms, δxv
vrms = 0.5m/s, δxv = 0.4µm. Thus with a small (20 nm)
transverse coherence length, sub-micron lithography can
be performed.

In order to improve our resolution, we performed a sec-
ond experiment with several experimental modiﬁcations.
First, we improved the quality of the optics forming the
S beam to reduce the waist by a factor of 3. Next, as
shown in Fig. 3, we used a coherent transfer scheme by
detuning the S beam by 2 GHz and introducing Raman
beams. At resonant positions in the light mask, the Ra-

momentum diﬀusion by spontaneous emission, and can
implement further resolution improvements such as the
coherent manipulations described in Ref. [23].

These fabricated features are thirty times smaller than
those that have been detected in holographic masking ex-
periments [26], but still two orders of magnitude larger
than the smallest features fabricated with atom lithogra-
phy [1, 2, 3, 4]. Were the light gradient to be increased,
feature sizes in the second ARL scheme demonstrated
would be limited by the velocity spread of the atomic
beam, at δxv = 0.4 µm. Therefore, the spectroscopi-
cally limited feature size observed in Fig. 4 is a factor
of two above the minimum observable linewidth for the
collimation of our atomic beam. By comparison, the res-
olution limit of an optimized light mask with a gradient
of F/~ = 2π

6.4 MHz/µm is δxℓ = 54 nm for Ar*.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of fre-
quency encoding in optical masks for atom lithography.
Using a two-photon internal state transfer, we create fea-
tures in silicon with an rms width of 0.9
0.1 µm. With a
mask based on optical pumping, we show that feature po-
sition can be chosen continuously throughout monotonic
potential gradients. Such a method could be used to form
intricate, sub-micron, two-dimensional patterns with cur-
rently available sources. Lithography using internal ma-

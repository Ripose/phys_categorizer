Abstract

We investigate electronically excited atoms in a magnetic guide. It turns out that the Hamilto-

nian describing this system possesses a wealth of both unitary as well as antiunitary symmetries

that constitute an uncommon extensive symmetry group. One consequence is the two-fold de-

generacy of any energy level. The spectral properties are investigated for a wide range of ﬁeld

gradients and the spatial distributions of the spin polarization are analyzed. Wave lengths, oscil-

lator strengths and selection rules are provided for the corresponding electromagnetic transitions.

The eﬀects due to an additional homogeneous bias ﬁeld constituting a Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap are

explored equally.

INTRODUCTION

External ﬁelds are nowadays widely used to control the motion of atoms including their

cooling and trapping as well as the preparation of their internal states. Optical lattices and

atom chips are two major examples of devices that allow to deal with atomic ensembles

but also possess the perspective of manipulating single atoms for the purpose of quantum

information processing. To this end it is indispensable to understand the structure and

behaviour of (excited) individual atoms in traps. In the case of the atom chip (see ref.[1] and

references therein) tight magnetic traps on the micrometer scale can be created exhibiting

large ﬁeld gradients which are not accessible in the case of macrosopic traps. Highly excited

Rydberg atoms therefore start to ’feel’ the variation i.e. the inhomogeneity of the magnetic

ﬁeld across the extension of their wave functions. This naturally leads to the question: How

do inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations alter the electronic structure of excited

atoms ?

During the past decades many thorough investigations have been performed on the be-

haviour and properties of excited (Rydberg-) atoms in homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds (see the

books and reviews [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). Indeed investigations on atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds

provided major contributions to a variety of diﬀerent research areas such as semiclassics

of nonintegrable systems, ’quantum chaos’, nonlinear dynamics, astrophysics of magnetized

stars and it elucidated and signiﬁcantly advanced our understanding of magnetized struc-

tures in general.

In contrast to the case of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld there exist no studies on the

electronic structure of atoms in the presence of inhomogeneous external ﬁelds: all investiga-

tions in the literature on the behaviour of ultracold atoms in inhomogeneous ﬁelds typically

treat the atom as a point particle whose magnetic moment couples either adiabatically [1] or

nonadiabatically [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] to the external ﬁeld. This holds with the exception of

two very recent works [13, 17] that consider the electronic structure of atoms with a single

active electron subject to a three-dimensional quadrupole ﬁeld. A variety of interesting new

phenomena have been observed there. The symmetries of this system cause each energy

level to be degenerate in the presence of the ﬁeld. Furthermore the intimate coupling of

the spin and spatial degrees of freedom leads to a complex spatial distribution of the spin

polarization of individual electronic states. A remarkable property of the electronic states

2

in the 3D-quadrupole trap is the fact that they possess a magnetic ﬁeld-induced permanent

electric dipole moment whose size strongly varies with the Rydberg state considered. Besides

the 3D-quadrupole ﬁeld there is another generic inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration

which is employed to trap atoms in particular on the atom chip [1]. This is the so-called side

guide which is created by superimposing the magnetic ﬁeld of a current carrying wire with

a homogeneous bias ﬁeld oriented perpendicular to the wire. The resulting magnetic guide

can be augmented to a Ioﬀe-Pritchard type 2D-trap by applying an additional homogeneous

bias ﬁeld parallel to the wire. It is exactly this conﬁguration which is studied in the present

work i.e. we investigate the structure and properties of electronically excited atoms in a

magnetic guide. According to the eﬀects obtained for atoms in a 3D-quadrupole trap in

Refs. [13, 17] we expect also the atoms in a side guide to exhibit interesting new features.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we introduce the ﬁeld conﬁguration gen-

erated by a so-called side guide. We specify our approach which is particularly suited for

ultra-cold atoms with a single active electron and derive the corresponding Hamiltonian.

This Hamiltonian exhibits a wealth of both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries and consti-

tutes an uncommon large symmetry group which is analyzed in Sec. III. In particular these

symmetries lead to a two-fold degeneracy of any energy level, similar to the case of an atom

in a 3D-quadrupole trap. A discussion of an arbitrary spin- 1

2 -systems in a ﬁeld conﬁguration
obeying certain symmetries are discussed. Section IV contains a discussion of the properties

of the symmetry-adapted electronic states. In Sec. V the latter are studied in case an addi-

tional homogeneous (Ioﬀe-)ﬁeld is applied. The numerical methods being employed in order

to solve the stationary Schr¨odinger equation are brieﬂy outlined in Sec. VI. A discussion of

our results is provided in Sec. VII. We analyze the spectra for a wide range of gradients.

Furthermore we explore properties of the electronic spin such as spin expectation values and

distributions of the spin polarization. Selection rules and dipole strengths of electric dipole

transitions are calculated. We close with a discussion of the electronic structure in case a

homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is applied in addition to the ﬁeld of the magnetic guide. Sec.

VIII contains the summary and outlook.

II. THE FIELD CONFIGURATION AND THE HAMILTONIAN

Alkali atoms are used throughout many experiments in ultra cold atomic physics. Besides

a single active electron they possess a closed shell core and the total electronic spin is

therefore exclusively carried by the outer electron. We assume the motion of this valence

electron to take place in the Coulomb potential of a single positive point charge. Since the

focus of this work is to understand fundamental features of electronically excited atoms in a

certain inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld we do not account for quantum defects which would

require the consideration of core-electron scattering processes. We also neglect relativistic

eﬀects such as spin-orbit and hyperﬁne coupling. Both interaction possess a r−

3-dependence

with r being the distance between the outer electron and the nucleus. For (highly) excited

states their contributions can safely be neglected or, if necessary accounted for by means

of perturbation theory. Since we focus on ultra cold atoms eﬀects of the center of mass

(c.m.) motion on the electronic motion are neglected here. Speciﬁcally we assume an

inﬁnitely heavy core (c.m.) located at the minimum of the magnetic ﬁeld. Employing the

above approximations the Hamiltonian describing the motion of the valence electron in the

presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld reads

The magnetic ﬁeld is introduced via the minimal coupling including the vector potential

thereby providing the kinetic energy in the presence of the ﬁeld. The third term represents

the coupling between the spin of the electron and the external ﬁeld. A common conﬁguration

for the manipulation of neutral atoms is the so-called magnetic side guide [1]. This particular

setup is generated by a current carrying wire whose ’circular’ magnetic ﬁeld is superimposed

by an external homogeneous bias ﬁeld perpendicular to the current ﬂow. As a result the ﬁeld
vanishes along a line parallel to the wire at a distance ρ0 = µ0I

2πB being completely determined
by the current I and the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld strength B. The Taylor expansion of

the ﬁeld around ρ0 yields

The ﬁrst two terms of (5) represent the non-relativistic hydrogen atom. The third term

which is linear with respect to b replaces the angular Zeeman term [26] which would occur

in a homogeneous ﬁeld. Here the spatial coordinates in x and y couple with the momentum

in z direction. The successive diamagnetic term

b2 represents an oscillator coupling term

∝

conﬁning the electronic motion in the x and y direction except for the axis exit channels.

This is reminiscent but also very diﬀerent to the situation in a homogeneous ﬁeld, where

the diamagnetic interactions in the x and y direction separate and represent pure harmonic

oscillators. Finally the ﬁfth term represents the coupling of the electronic spin to the spatial

coordinates arises from the interaction of its magnetic moment with the ﬁeld. We here

encounter a linear dependence on the spatial coordinates and the gradient b. This term

prevents the factorization of the motions in coordinate space and spin space. Finally one

should note that the only explicit dependence on the coordinate z is due to the Coulomb

term. Without this rotationally invariant interaction the system would be invariant under

translations with respect to the z-coordinate.

In this section we analyze the structure of the Hamiltonian (5) in detail. After studying

its symmetries we discuss how these symmetries aﬀect the excitation spectrum. As a result

of a tedious and elaborate analysis of the Hamiltonian (5) we found 15 distinct symmetry

operations leaving it invariant. A complete list is provided in table I. Each symmetry is

composed of a number of elementary operations which are shown in table II. All symmetry

operations are either unitary or anti-unitary. The anti-unitary ones involve the conventional

time reversal operator T . In spite of its simplicity our system therefore possesses a wealth

of symmetry properties. The algebra of the underlying symmetry group possesses a com-

plicated structure some features of which will be discussed in the following. The operators

Σx, Σy and Σz generate a sub-group obeying the algebra [Σi, Σj] = 2i ǫijkΣk reminiscent of

angular momentum operators. We have Σ2

i = 1. Interestingly these quantities act on both

real and spin space. A deeper look into the representation theory of our group reveals a

two-fold degeneracy of any energy level similar to those we encountered in our investigations

of atoms in a three-dimensional quadrupole trap [13, 17].

Alternatively this degeneracy can also be established as follows. The operations Σz and

one could think of performing the above calculation repeatedly but now substituting T σxPz

with any operator listed in table I which anti-commutes with Σz. It turns out that all of the

resulting states generated by this scheme are either superpositions of

or

diﬀer only by a phase factor from one of these states.

Out of the 15 symmetry operations one can choose several sets of commuting operators.

For the following investigation we choose the set H, Σz, PyPzIxyS2. The combination of Σz

and PyPzIxyS2 leads to the additional commuting operator PxPzIxyS∗2. We have found the
properties:

(PyPzIxyS2)2 = (PxPzIxyS∗2)2 =

(Σz)2 = (PyPzIxyS2)4 = (PxPzIxyS∗2)4 = 1.

For completeness we provide here the general embedding of the above-derived degeneracies

due to symmetries. Let us assume we have a general spin- 1

2 -systems with the following

accompanying properties:

1. There are two operators A and B commuting with the underlying Hamiltonian:

[H, A] = [H, B] = 0.

2. A and B anti-commute:

respectively.

3. A is a Hermitian operator. B is an (anti-)unitary operator which can be written as a

product B = RS where R and S exclusively act on the real space and the spin space,

6
4. The operator S is trace-less: Tr S = 0.

If these conditions are fullﬁlled any state is doubly degenerate. This is seen as follows.

Property 4 immediately leads to Tr B = 0. Hence, we ﬁnd the nonzero eigenvalues of B to

appear pairwise with opposite signs. If now

are two degenerate energy-eigenstates of the system.

In the present case the two anti-commuting operators are Σz and T σxPz. For the case

of an atom in a three-dimensional quadrupole ﬁeld we have A = Jz and B = T σxPz. In

a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld the remaining symmetries constitute an Abelian symmetry

group leading to exclusively one dimensional irreducible representations i.e. no degeneracies

occur. Finally we remark that the reader can ﬁnd in ref. [18] a discussion of degeneracies

in spin- 1

2-systems based on the properties of time-reversal operators.

V. ADDITIONAL HOMOGENEOUS FIELD IN z-DIRECTION (IOFFE FIELD)

The application of an additional homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld along the z-direction (Ioﬀe

ﬁeld) has a dramatic impact on the properties of the system. In particular the symmetry

properties are aﬀected. The Hamiltonian becomes

ﬁeld terms can simply be added to the Hamiltonian (5). We ﬁnd the well known Zeeman

as well as the diamagnetic oscillator term. The coupling of the spin to the Ioﬀe ﬁeld leads

to a term being proportional to σz. The symmetries of HI are listed in table III. Due to

the presence of the additional homogeneous ﬁeld numerous symmetries are lost (see table I

for comparison). The remaining operations form a non-Abelian algebra. In contrast to the

group operations listed in table I there are no two anti-commuting operators. Hence it is

not possible to construct pairs of degenerate energy eigenstates as discussed above. Thus,

applying the Ioﬀe ﬁeld lifts the degeneracies occuring in the absence of it. Even with a

ﬁnite Ioﬀe ﬁeld the operations Σz, PyPzIxyS2 and PxPzIxyS∗2 together with HI form a set of
commuting operators.

VI. NUMERICAL TREATMENT

In order to obtain many eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians (5) and (22)

particularly for highly excited Rydberg states we adopt the linear variational principle. Here

the bound state solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation are expanded in a ﬁnite set of square

integrable basis functions. Determining the expansion coeﬃcients is equivalent to solving a

generalized eigenvalue problem in case of non-orthogonal basis functions. The latter is done

numerically by employing standard linear algebra techniques and routines.

To accomplish the above we adopt spherical coordinates. The Hamiltonian (5) then

becomes

ticular the non-linear variational parameter ζ has to adapted such that it corresponds to

the inverse of the characteristic length scale of the desired wavefunctions. Similar basis sets

have been employed previously by several other authors [14, 15, 16].

The vector ~v contains the expansion coeﬃcients anlm, bnlm, cnlm and dnlm.

Due to the particular choice of the basis functions (25) the matrices H and S become

extremely sparse occupied (S is a penta-banded matrix). In order to solve the generalized

eigenvalue equation we utilize the so-called Arnoldi method together with the shift-and-

invert method. We adopt routines from the ARPACK package. A more detailed description

can be found in [17].

VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we analyze our computational results i.e. the eigenvalues and eigenfunc-

tions obtained via the numerical approach described in the previous section. We discuss

the spectra and expectation values of several observables as well as the properties of the

electronic spin. Furthermore selection rules for electric dipole transitions as well as their

strengths are derived. Results for the case of the additional presence of a homogeneous bias

ﬁeld are presented as well.

A. Spectral Properties

With respect to the spectral behavior one can distinguish three regimes: the weak, the

intermediate and the strong gradient regime each of which reveals individual characteris-

tics. The appearance of these regimes is not determined by the gradient and the degree of

excitation, i.e. energy, but by the scaled energy (see discussion in Sec. I). For simplicity we

will refer to the gradient as the relevant quantity characterizing the diﬀerent regimes. All

ﬁgures in this subsection show energy levels for manifolds belonging to rather small values

for n (typically (n = 5

7)) and for large gradients (we cover the range b = 10−

−

10−

−

that are not accessible in the laboratory. This was done for reasons of illustration: Our

observations and results equally hold for weaker gradients and higher n-manifolds (gradi-

ents achievable for tight traps on atom chips are of the order of b = 10−

8) which however,

due to the high level density, are less suited for a graphical presentation. In the weak gra-

dient regime the spectral behaviour is determined by the linear Zeeman terms. Although

the principal quantum number n is not a good quantum number any given level can be as-

signed to a certain n-multiplet. The levels split symmetrically around the zero-ﬁeld-energy

exhibiting the expected linear dependence on b. In ﬁgure 2a this is exemplarily shown for

the n = 5-multiplet.

The intermediate regime is characterized by the occurence of intra n-manifold mixing.

Although neighboring n-manifolds are still distinguishable the levels now aquire a a nonlinear

b-dependence which is due to the increasing importance of the diamagnetic term. Sub-levels

belonging to diﬀerent angular momenta mix and thus avoided level-crossings appear. The

onset of this intermediate regime scales according to b

6. Figure 2b shows the regime

∝

of intermediate gradients of the n = 5-multiplet. Interestingly we observe here that this

nonlinear behaviour in the l

mixing regime is very weakly pronounced for the atom in the

−

side guide compared to an atom in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [2]. As we enter the

strong gradient regime adjacent n-manifolds begin to overlap. The spectra are strongly i.e.

nonperturbatively inﬂuenced by the diamagnetic term. Figure 3 shows this inter n-manifold

mixing for the n = 6- and n = 7-multiplet where the strong coupling leads to large avoided

crossings. The mixing threshold scales according to b

B. Properties of the Electronic Spin

the properties of the electronic spin. The x- and y-components of the spin operator obey

WSB(~r) describes the spatial distribution of the spin polarization relative to the local mag-

netic ﬁeld. WSB(~r) = 1 indicates the spin to be oriented parallel to the ﬁeld whereas we ﬁnd

local expectation value of the cosine of the angle γ between ~S and ~B. Since in a homogenous

ﬁeld the projection of the spin onto the ﬁeld direction is conserved WSB(~r) would be either

+1 or

1 throughout the whole space. In the ﬁeld of the side guide, however, we expect a

much richer structure resulting from the coupling of the coordinate and the spin degrees of

freedom. Figure 5 shows three tomographic cuts of a the spin polarization WSB of the 83rd

by the magnetic interaction which is invariant under translations along z. One identiﬁes

four sectors reminiscent of the quadrupolar structure of the magnetic ﬁeld of the guides. In

the present case we apparently have a anti-parallel alignment in the x = 0- and y = 0-plane

and a parallel one between these planes. The densities are invariant under the operations

PxPy and PzIxy which are equivalent to Σz and PyPzIxyS2 when acting on real and scalar

quantities.

C. Electric Dipole Transitions

We now consider electromagnetic transitions between electronic states in the framework

of the dipole approximation. The transition amplitude between the initial state

and the

We have calculated the dipole strengths for transitions from the ground state to excited

states. Figure 7 shows the results we obtain for π-transitions between the κ = 1- and

1-subspace. In ﬁgure 7a we observe a general decrease of the dipole strengths with

decreasing transition wavelengths. However, the decrease is not monotonous as it would be

in the case of a homogeneous or a 3D-quadrupole ﬁeld [17]. One rather ﬁnds a modulation

on top of the transition amplitudes where the n = 8-, n = 10- and n = 12-multiplet exhibit

smaller dipole strengths than both of their neighbors. Figure 7b shows a zoomed view of

Again there are two dominating lines which are now located in the two outer bunches rather

than in the central one.

D. Magnetic Guide with a Ioﬀe ﬁeld

As discussed in section II an additionally applied homogeneous ﬁeld leads to severe

changes of the symmetry properties of the atomic system. Apart from the lifting of the

degeneracies also a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the electronic spin and the transition amplitudes

have to be expected.

Apparently there has to be a critical radius ρc at which both ﬁelds are equal in strength.

For a given gradient b and homogeneous ﬁeld strength BI it is given by ρc = BI

b . Taking

20

into account the scaling

h

i ∝

(42)

to be equally aﬀected by both ﬁelds. Hence, the states having n

be dominated by the homogeneous ﬁeld or the ﬁeld of the side guide, respectively. Figure

values to move towards zero which is expected from the results shown in ﬁgure 4. We have

to remark that since the symmetry Σz persists the expectation values of Sx and Sy vanish

even for ﬁnite strength of the homogeneous ﬁeld.

Apart from the spin expectation value also the spin polarization exhibits signiﬁcant

changes if a Ioﬀe ﬁeld is switched on. For a suﬃcient high ﬁeld strength or low degree

of excitation (n < nc), respectively, the structure of the electronic states is dominated by

21

the Ioﬀe ﬁeld. Here the spin is expected to be aligned with the homogeneous ﬁeld. Since

WSB describes the projection of the electronic spin onto the direction of the side guide ﬁeld

which is perpendicular to the Ioﬀe ﬁeld one expects WSB to be approximately zero in this

regime. Figure 10 illustrates the SB polarization WSB (equation (36)) for the state shown

5. The state is located inside the n = 8

multiplet which lies below the critical quantum number nc = 10. Thus the states structure

is dominated by the Ioﬀe ﬁeld. As expected from the discussion above we observe large gray

regions indicating WSB = 0. The geometry of the side guide ﬁeld is barely recognized for the

cut made at z = 0. Unlike in ﬁgure 5 there are only small regions exhibiting a well-deﬁned

spin orientation that is dominated by the side guide, i.e either WSB =

1 or WSB = 1.

Figure 11a shows the dipole strengths for π-transitions from the ground state in the

κ = 1-subspace to various states in the κ =

1-subspace. Compared to the BI = 0 case

−

the dipole strengths are increased by approximately 70%. The transition strengths increase

with increasing transition wavelengths. Again there seems to occur some kind of modulation

as already seen in ﬁgure 7a but being less pronounced here. In the present case the n = 12-

transition exhibits a larger transition amplitude than its neighbors. In ﬁgure 11b we show

a zoomed view of the line belonging to the n = 12-transition. Due to the presence of the

homogeneous ﬁeld a number of additional lines appear some of which are marked by an

arrow. In contrast to the BI = 0 case the n = 12 line is dominated by a single sub-line

originating from a transition induced by the presence of the homogeneous ﬁeld.

VIII. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have studied electronically excited hydrogen atoms located in a magnetic guide. In-

cluding pseudo-potentials [19] for the atomic core could be straight forwardly extended to

describe e.g. alkali atoms. The magnetic guide represents a microtrap used to conﬁne ultra-

cold atomic systems. The motion of the valence electron has been described by an eﬀective

one-body approach. Both the coupling of the spatial degrees of freedom (para- and diamag-

netism) as well as the spin degrees of freedom to the external ﬁeld have been taken into

account. The linear variational principle has been used to solve the stationary Schr¨odinger

equation: Employing a Sturmian basis set enabled us to converge a large number of eigen-

functions.

A careful inspection of the Hamiltonian yields an amazingly large number of symme-

tries involving both the spin and spatial degrees of freedom: We have found 15 symmetry

operations of both unitary and anti-unitary character. This allows for a classiﬁcation of

the electronic eigenstates with respect to a complete set of commuting constants of motion.

The latter involve the Hermitian Σz-operator which is a combined spin and parity operator

and the unitary but non-Hermitian operator PyPzIxyS2 which involves parity and permu-

23

tation operators. Employing speciﬁc anticommuting operators of this symmetry group we

could prove the two-fold degeneracy of each energy level. This feature is indeed shown to

be generic for spin- 1

2-systems exhibiting certain symmetry properties. We have discussed
how the symmetries are aﬀected if an additional homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is applied in

order to obtain a Ioﬀe-Pritchard type trap. In this case only 7 symmetry operations remain

including Σz, PyPzIxyS2 and PxPzIxyS∗2.

Spectra have been investigated up to energies corresponding to a principal quantum

number of n

15. In the low gradient regime degenerate n-manifolds split up symmetrically

≈

around the zero ﬁeld energy. For the intra-n-mixing regime only a very weak restructuring

takes place inside any n-multiplet i.e. we observe only a minor nonlinear behaviour of the

energies on the gradient. For even higher gradients the inter-n-mixing takes place where

states belonging to adjacent multiplets begin to mix and avoided crossings dominate the

spectrum. Scaling relations for both, the inter- and the intra-n-mixing have been provided.

Eﬀects due to the coupling of the spin and spatial degrees of freedom have been studied

in detail. An analysis of the spin-ﬁeld orientation has been performed by utilizing the

distribution of the spin polarization. For electronic states in the magnetic guide WSB reveals

a rich nodal and island structure which is absent for an atom in a uniform ﬁeld. Moreover

an analysis of the Sz expectation value has been performed. It has been shown that states

being energetically strongly aﬀected by the presence of the magnetic guide possess a small

expectation value of Sz.

We have derived selection rules for the quantum number κ belonging to the PyPzIxyS2

symmetry operator for linear as well as circular polarized dipole transitions. Wave lengths

and dipole strengths from the ground to Rydberg states were analyzed. In particular for π

transitions we have found a global modulation of the transition amplitudes. The impact of

the presence of an additional homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (along the wire involved in the

set-up of the side guide) on several relevant quantities has been studied. This includes the

Sz-expectation values and the electric dipole transition amplitudes.

Let us now comment on the approach chosen in the present work. Neglecting the ﬁne

and hyperﬁne structure of the atom as well as omitting the inﬂuence of the core scattering

events represent, at least for certain species and regimes (high excitations !), certainly a

good approximation to the true physical system. Another approximation is the fact that

we centered the nucleus at the minimum of the ﬁeld conﬁguration. This is suggested by

24

our assumption that we have ultracold atoms with an extremely small kinetic c.m. energy

in tight traps leading to a well-localized atomic c.m. Nevertheless, it is expected that the

c.m. motion blurs the eﬀects ocurring for an atom with a ﬁxed nucleus. Beyond this,

it is well-known that already in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld the c.m.

and electronic motions of atoms do not separate i.e. they perform an intimately coupled

motion [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Then the immediate question arises how this coupling might

look like in our inhomogeneous ﬁeld conﬁguration and in particular what its impact on the

overall electronic motion is. To investigate this is a challenging task which needs careful

consideration and clearly goes beyond the scope of the present work.

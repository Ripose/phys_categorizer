Recoil corrections to the atomic decay rate are considered in the order of Z m/M . The expressions
are carried out for exact value without any expansion over Z α as well as for the leading relativistic
recoil correction in the order (Z m/M ) (Z α)2. The expressions obtained are valid both for muonic
atoms (for which they contribute on the level of a few percent in high Z ions) and for few electron
atoms.

This work is devoted to a calculation of the recoil eﬀects for the atomic decay rate. These eﬀects can be more
important in muonic atoms. The leading term is due to nonrelativistic emission by the nucleus and it has relative
order Zmµ/MN or approximately 1/20 (in light muonic atoms, for which A ≃ 2Z). The nuclear emission was ﬁrst
taken into consideration in Ref. [1] for hydrogen-like systems. That result is actually a non-relativistic one, which
includes all corrections in the expansion over both recoil small parameters m/M and Z m/M . It is of the form

ΓN R−Rec = Γ∞ ·

where Γ∞ is the non-relativistic decay rate of a level in an atom with an inﬁnite nuclear mass. Some developement
and discussions were also presented in Refs. [2,3]. The result was deduced there from the classical non-relativistic
two-particle hamiltonian. As it was found in Ref. [4] it can be also obtained from dimensional analysis and symmetry
between the electron and the nucleus with spin 1/2. It was also demonstrated there that the result for the decay rate
is directly connected with that for the Bethe logarithm (log(k0)), which is well known.

The approach of Ref. [4] is adjusted here for the relativistic correction in the expansion over Zm/M . The important
point of consideration there and here is that the ﬁrst order Zm/M correction to the dipole matrix element has to
have a spin independent form. Hence, it is enough to evaluate the expression for a nucleus with spin I = 1/2. Some
symmetry between the electron and nucleus has to be in the leading non-relativistic expression. The general expression
is not symmetric in the relativistic case. In that case, the nuclear wave function is a free spinor, but the electronic one is
an eigenfunction of the Dirac equation. The expressions to derive are valid for both the electronic and muonic system,
but in the last case, they are expected to be more important for the comparison between theory and experiment.
The emission of photon in λ′ → λ transition in (electronic) hydrogen-like atoms is due to the electric current

that the expression is an exact relativistic one. The decay rate to be calculated is indeed a gauge independent value,
but the intermediate results may be gauge dependent and we are working here in the Coulomb gauge, in which only
space component of the current are important. Neglecting here nuclear spin eﬀects1, one can easily obtain

Following Ref. [4] we are reproducing the leading correction evaluation. The exponent and γ0 can be substituted
for unity, and the electron wave function can be approximated by the product of the free spinor and the Schr¨odinger
Coulomb wave function. Neglecting electron spin eﬀects, one can ﬁnd

Corrections to the frequency are of the order m/M and to be neglected and one can return to Eq. (1).

Now we can start to carry out the leading relativistic recoil correction. The contributions to it are due to factors
, and the diﬀerence between exact Dirac wave function and the approximation used. We

The ﬁrst term (Eq. (5)) can be found using some anticommutator identity:

where

Now, let us consider the second term. One can see that for the contribution to the decay up to the leading radiative
correction it is enough to approximate the Dirac wave function by the product of the free electron spinor and the
Schr¨odinger wave function of the hydrogen atom. Eq. (6) is rewritten to be of the form

Coeﬃcients for the 2pj → 1s transitions in the hydrogen-like atoms are summarized in Table I. The corrections to
the intensity have just the same form, as far as Z m/M corrections arise from the dipole matrix element, but not the
transition frequency.

In conclusion it should be noted that this work is rather devoted to muonic atoms because the corrections considered
above and summarized in Table I are more important there and enter at the level of a few percent for high nuclear
charge Z. The expressions obtained in this work are of use both for muonic and electronic hydrogen-like atoms. In the
case of “usual” (electronic) atoms they are actually valid also for few electron systems. In the last case it is necessary
to substitute any single electronic operator for the sum over all electrons. For instance in the case of Eqs. (3) and (14)
one can use the substitutions

Abstract. Absolute three-photon detachment cross sections are calculated for the
ﬂuorine negative ion within the lowest-order perturbation theory. The Dyson equation
of the atomic many-body theory is used to obtain the ground-state 2p wavefunction
with correct asymptotic behaviour, corresponding to the true (experimental) binding
energy. We show that in accordance with the adiabatic theory (Gribakin and Kuchiev
1997 Phys. Rev. A 55 3760) this is crucial for obtaining absolute values of the
multiphoton cross sections. Comparisons with other calculations and experimental
data are presented.

Introduction

Starting from the pioneering works of Hall et al (1965) and Robinson and Geltman
(1967) the behaviour of negative ions in laser ﬁelds has been the subject of numerous
studies for over thirty years. Nevertheless, up to now there are very few ﬁrmly
established results on the absolute values of the cross sections and photoelectron angular
distributions in multiphoton processes.

This is true even for the simplest two-photon detachment processes. For example,
the results of a number of experimental and theoretical works on the cross sections and
photoelectron angular distributions in the negative halogen ions (see, e.g., van der Hart
1996, Gribakin et al 1999 and references therein) diﬀer signiﬁcantly each from other.
A number of experimental works reported the cross sections and angular asymmetry
parameters of the two-photon detachment from the halogen negative ions at selected
photon energies (Trainham et al 1987, Blondel et al 1989a, 1992, Kwon et al 1989,
Davidson et al 1992, Sturrus et al 1992, Blondel and Delsart 1993). These measurements
were performed at the end of 80’s – beginning of 90’s, and to the best of our knowledge
no new experimental data on multiphoton detachment from the negative halogens have
been published since.

On the theoretical side, a recent development in the study of multiphoton
detachment from negative ions has been done within the adiabatic approach (Gribakin
and Kuchiev 1997a,b). It has established that the electron escape from an atomic system
in a low-frequency laser ﬁeld takes place at large electron-atom separations,

where ω is the photon frequency, κ is related to the initial bound-state energy, E0 =

Ar−1e−κr
Therefore, the asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wavefunction R(r)
is crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the probabilities of multiphoton
processes. Direct calculations of two-photon detachment from halogen negative ions
within the lowest-order perturbation theory (Gribakin et al 1998, 1999) with both the
Hartree-Fock (HF) and the asymptotically correct valence np wavefunctions conﬁrm
this understanding. The point is that the HF wave functions are characterised by
κ values generally exceeding the true experimental ones. As a result, when we use
asymptotically correct wave functions the cross sections are signiﬁcantly higher than
those obtained within other methods which rely on the HF or similar ground-state
wavefunctions (Crance 1987, 1988, Jiang and Starace 1988, Pan et al 1990, van der Hart
1996). Moreover, the use of the ground-state wavefunctions with correct asymptotic
behaviour in multiphoton detachment calculations is often more important than other
eﬀects of electron correlations. Note that the analytic adiabatic theory (Gribakin and
Kuchiev 1997a,b) which is valid for n
1 gives reasonable estimates of the cross sections

≫

even for n = 2 when correct asymptotic parameters are used.

As far as three-photon detachment from negative ions is concerned, the experimental
and theoretical results are more scarce than those on the two-photon detachment.
Thus, there have been only two experimental measurements of the cross section for
F− at a single photon energy performed by Blondel et al (1989b) and Kwon et al
(1989), and a few theoretical values obtained in the early calculations by Crance (1987,
1988). Recently van der Hart (1996) applied an R-matrix Floquet approach to study
the photodetachment from F− and Cl− for n = 1, 2 and 3.

The aim of this work is to perform direct numerical calculations of the three-photon
detachment cross section for the negative ﬂuorine ion using an asymptotically correct
ground-state wavefunction and compare the results with the available theoretical and
experimental data. As in our previous two-photon calculations (Gribakin et al 1999)
the correct 2p wavefunction is obtained within the many-body Dyson equation method.
Section 2 outlines brieﬂy the method of calculation. A discussion of our results and
comparisons with other calculations and experimental data are presented in Section 3.

2. Three-photon detachment cross section

The total cross section of three-photon detachment of the n0l0 electron from an atomic
system by a linearly polarized light of frequency ω can be written as

In this sum above the partial cross sections σlf L are characterised by the orbital
momentum lf of the ﬁnal-state photoelectron coupled with the atomic residue into the
total orbital momentum L. The second equality assumes that the continuous-spectrum
wavefunction of the photoelectron in the matrix element B(L)
l0lf (ω) is normalized to the
δ-function of energy. After absorption of three dipole photons by an outer np electron
in a halogen negative ion np6 1S, the ﬁnal state photoelectron can leave the system in
the s-, d- or g-waves. So, the possible ﬁnal states are: lf = 0 (1P ), lf = 2 (1P and 1F )
and lf = 4 (1F ).

In the lowest perturbation-theory order the three-photon amplitude B(L)

If one describes the initial state n0l0 in the HF approximation, the asymptotic
behaviour of the corresponding radial wavefunction is incorrect. Namely,
it is
characterized by κ corresponding to the HF binding energy, rather than the exact
(experimental) one. Thus, in F− the HF value is κ = 0.6, whereas the true one is
κ = 0.5. As we showed for the two-photon detachment (Gribakin et al 1998, 1999),
it is very important to use asymptotically correct bound-state wavefunctions.
In the
present work we reﬁne the bound-state wavefunction using the Dyson equation method
in the same way as it was done in our two-photon calculations (Gribakin et al 1999).
This enables us to obtain the 2p wavefunction of F− with the correct binding energy
= 0.250 Ryd, equal to the electron aﬃnity of ﬂuorine (Hotop and Lineberger 1985).

The wavefunctions of the intermediate (n1l1, n2l2) and ﬁnal (Ef lf ) states of the
photoelectron are calculated in the HF ﬁeld of the frozen neutral F-atom residue 2p5.
The photoelectron is coupled to the atomic residue to form the total spin S = 0 and the
angular momenta L1 = 1 for the ﬁrst intermediate s and d states (l1 = 0, 2), L2 = 0, 2
for the second intermediate p-wave state (l2 = 1), and L2 = 2 for the second intermediate
f -wave state (lf = 3). In the ﬁnal state the photoelectron is coupled to the core with
Lf = 1 for the s- and d-wave, and Lf = 3 for the d- and g-wave. The intermediate state
continua are discretized and represented by a 70-state photoelectron momentum mesh
with constant spacing ∆k.

Note that the importance of large distances in multiphoton problems speaks in
favour of the length form of the photon dipole operator (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b).
This is in agreement with the results of Pan et al (1990) who showed that the two-
photon detachment cross sections obtained with the dipole operator in the velocity form
are much more sensitive to the shift of the photodetachment threshold and correlation
corrections. On the other hand, electron correlations have a much weaker eﬀect on the
calculations with the length form, and the corresponding results are more robust, and
hence, more reliable.

The two-photon AL2

l0l2(ω, E0, E2) (4) and three-photon B(L)
l0lf (ω) (3) amplitudes are
calculated by direct summation over the intermediate states. This method involves
accurate evaluation of the free-free dipole matrix elements, and special attention is paid
to pole- and δ-type singularities of the integrand (Korol 1994, 1997).

In the present work we demonstrate the eﬀect of the asymptotic behaviour of the bound-
state wavefunction by presenting the results obtained with the HF 2p wavefunction
(EHF
0.362 Ryd), and with the 2p wavefunction which possesses a correct
experimental energy Eexp
0.250 Ryd. The latter is obtained within the Dyson
equation approach (Gribakin et al 1999). It is quite close to the HF wavefunction inside
the atom, whereas for r > 2 au it has larger values than the HF solution, due to a
smaller binding energy and κ. The asymptotic behaviour of the Dyson 2p orbital is
characterized by κ = 0.5 and A = 0.64. For comparison we also calculate the cross
sections within the plane-wave approximation and using the analytic adiabatic theory
formula (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b).

−

In ﬁgure 1 we present three-photon detachment cross sections calculated for F− using
various approaches for the whole energy range studied. Figure 2 shows a comparison
between our results and other theoretical and experimental results.
In general, all
calculations reveal the small near-threshold maximum due to the contribution of the
ﬁnal photoelectron s-wave, and a broad maximum at larger energies due to the d-wave
contribution.

When we use the experimental threshold energy together with the HF 2p
wavefunction (double-dot-dash curve in ﬁgure 1), the overall magnitude of the cross
section remains close to that obtained with the HF threshold and wave function. On
the other hand, when we use the 2p Dyson orbital (solid line) the cross section becomes
substantially higher. This clearly demonstrates the eﬀect of the asymptotic behaviour
of the bound-state wavefunction. Moreover, the diﬀerence between the three-photon
cross sections obtained with the HF and Dyson 2p wavefunctions is greater than that
between the corresponding two-photon cross sections (Gribakin et al. 1999). This can

6

be related to the fact that with the increase of n the range of important distances (1)
increases, and the diﬀerence between the two bound-state wavefunctions becomes more
signiﬁcant.

The cross section obtained using the HF 2p orbital together with the experimental 2p
energy (double-dot-dash line in ﬁgures) shows a maximum of σ = 12.5 au at ω = 0.125
Ryd, near the two-photon detachment threshold. The HF results of Crance (1987) below
the two-photon detachment threshold (solid squares in ﬁgure 2) are close to ours. The
cross section of van der Hart (1996) obtained within the R-matrix Floquet approach is
20–30% higher (dashed line in ﬁgure 2) with a maximum of σ = 14.5 au at ω = 0.111
Ryd. Note that a similar diﬀerence between the HF calculations with the experimental
energy and the R-matrix Floquet approach was found for the two-photon detachment
cross sections of F− and Cl− (Gribakin et al 1999).
It may be due to the fact that
some correlations are included in the R-matrix Floquet ground-state wavefunction (see
discussion at the end of this section). The experimental results are shown in ﬁgure 2
by open symbols. Blondel et al (1989b) and Kwon et al (1989) have obtained the cross
section values of σ = 4.75(+2.02
−2.80) au, respectively, at ω = 0.0856
Ryd. Taken with the error bars, the latter value is consistent with the HF and R-matrix
Floquet calculation.

−1.40) au and σ = 6.15(+5.14

However, the best results of the present paper, shown by a solid curve in ﬁgure 2,
indicate that the cross section is substantially larger. Let us repeat once more that
this increase of the cross section is due to the events which happen at large separations,
where all correlation corrections are controlled very well. Henceforth we believe that our
calculations (solid curve) give the most accurate values for the cross section. Our cross
section substantially, by a factor of 2, exceeds the HF results as well as the R-matrix
0.114 Ryd. As is seen from ﬁgure
Floquet result. It has a maximum of σ = 27 au at ω
1, the diﬀerence between the cross sections obtained with the Dyson and HF orbitals
decreases towards the one-photon detachment threshold (ω = 0.25 Ryd). Indeed, with
the increase of ω and the energy of the photoelectron, smaller distances become more
important, see (1), and at these distances the two bound-state wavefunctions are quite
close.

≈

As noted above, the strong enhancement of the three-photon cross section due to a
changed asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction is in a agreement with the two-photon
calculations (Gribakin et al 1998, 1999) and with the conclusions of the analytical
adiabatic theory (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b). To make a direct comparison with
this theory we calculate the cross section given by equation (5) of Gribakin and Kuchiev
(1997b). The short-dash curve (ﬁgure 1) is obtained using A and κ values of the HF
2p orbital. The corresponding cross section is rather close to the HF result (dashed
curve) shifted to the HF threshold. When we use A and κ from the Dyson orbital, dot-
dash curves in ﬁgures 1 and 2, the cross section becomes much higher. It is about 30%

7

greater than our direct perturbation-theory calculation with the Dyson orbital, which
is a good accuracy for a simple analytical formula.
If we describe the photoelectron
in the intermediate and ﬁnal states using plane waves use plane-waves instead of the
HF wavefunctions the direct calculation (dotted line in ﬁgure1) is very close to the
adiabatic theory result. Therefore, we can attribute the discrepancy between the
adiabatic theory and numerical calculations to the use of free-electron Volkov states
in the theory. However, this discrepancy is not large, and it gets smaller with the
increase of n.

We see that the use of the asymptotically correct 2p wavefunction changes the
three-photon detachment cross section by a factor of two or more. This is similar to
the two-photon detachment process, where the eﬀect described above is greater than
other correlation eﬀects (Pan et al 1990, Gribakin et al 1999). There is no reason
to expect that the role of such correlations in three-photon detachment is stronger
than in two-photon detachment. Thus, we conclude that in multiphoton processes
the error introduced by using a bound-state wavefunction with incorrect asymptotic
behaviour could be much greater then the eﬀects of electron correlations. For the sake
of pure terminology we should mention that the correct description of the asymptotic
behaviour of a ground-state wave function needs inclusion of many-electron correlations,
see the Dyson equation discussed above. However, these correlations are very particular,
their manifestation can be described as a simple shift of the single-electron energy. In
contrast, conventionally the term ’many-electron correlations’ includes also processes
which cannot be described in the single-electron picture. The later ones are less
important in the problem considered.

4. Concluding remarks

In the present paper we have performed direct numerical calculations of the three-
photon detachment from the ﬂuorine negative ion, and paid special attention to a proper
description of the initial ground-state wavefunction. We ensured that it has correct
asymptotic behaviour by calculating the outer 2p orbital of the negative ion from the
many-body theory Dyson equation with the non-local correlation potential adjusted to
reproduce experimental binding energies. Our calculations demonstrate explicitly that
the use of asymptotically correct initial state wavefunctions is very important for ﬁnding
absolute values of multiphoton detachment cross sections. This conﬁrms the conclusion
of the adiabatic theory (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a,b, Gribakin et al 1999) about the
signiﬁcance of large electron-atom separations in multiphoton processes.

We calculated the parity nonconserving (PNC) 6s → 7s amplitude in Cs. In the Dirac-Coulomb
approximation our result is in a good agreement with other calculations. Breit corrections to the
PNC amplitude and to the Stark-induced amplitude β are found to be −0.4% and −1% respectively.
The weak charge of 133Cs is QW = −72.5 ± 0.7 in agreement with the standard model.

Introduction The last and the most accurate mea-
surement of the ratio of the parity nonconserving (PNC)
amplitude in Cs to the Stark-induced amplitude β was
done in Boulder [1]. Later the amplitude β was mea-
sured with a very high accuracy [2]. These measure-
ments together with atomic calculations of the PNC am-
plitude [3, 4] gave the most accurate atomic test of the
standard model. The authors of the the calculations [3, 4]
estimated their accuracy to be 1%. After that Bennet
and Wieman [2] compared theoretical and experimental
results for a number of observables including hyperﬁne
constants, E1 amplitudes, and the Stark-induced ampli-
tude β and suggested that the actual accuracy of atomic
calculations of the PNC amplitude was 0.4%. Their anal-
ysis gave the following value of the weak charge of 133Cs:
QW = −72.06(44), which diﬀers by 2.3σ from the stan-
dard model prediction [5]:

QSM

W = −73.09(3)

This result caused an intensive discussion (see [6] and
references therein).
It also stimulated a new wave of
atomic calculations [7, 8, 9]. First Derevianko [7] sug-
gested that previous calculations underestimated Breit
correction. He calculated the latter and added it to the
PNC amplitude from [3, 4]. That reduced the discrep-
ancy to 1.0σ. Somewhat smaller Breit corrections were
obtained in [8, 9].

Here we re-analyze the role of Breit interaction in cal-
culation of the PNC amplitude in Cs. In contrast to the
paper [7] we made a full scale calculation which (partly)
accounts for the higher order corrections of the many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT). The Breit interac-
tion was included on all stages of the calculation, i.e.
on the stage of the solution of the Dirac-Fock equations,
then on the stage of the solution of the random phase ap-
proximation (RPA) equations, and, ﬁnally, on the stage
of the evaluation of the self-energy operator. All these
corrections are of the same order of magnitude, which is
not surprising taking into account that both RPA and
MBPT contributions to the answer are quite signiﬁcant.

Our ﬁnal value of Breit correction to the PNC amplitude
is −0.4% in agreement with our preliminary result [9].

We also calculated Breit correction to the Stark-
induced amplitude β6s,7s and found it to be about 1%.
That suggests that an excellent agreement between the
theory [4] and the experiment [2] for this constant may
be partly accidental. In the end of this paper we discuss
corrections, which are not included in PNC calculations
and conclude that the accuracy of the atomic theory is
close to 1%. Within this accuracy there is no contradic-
tion with the standard model.

Details of the calculation The Dirac-Fock equations
were solved on a radial grid with the help of the code [10]
and all MBPT calculations were done using summations
over the basis set. We formed the Dirac-Fock-Coulomb
(DFC) and the Dirac-Fock-Coulomb-Breit (DFCB) vari-
ants of the basis set and repeated all calculations in ex-
actly the same way for both of them.

It is known from previous calculations of PNC eﬀects in
Cs that high orders in the residual Coulomb interaction
are very important. Indeed, the MBPT eﬀects account
for 13% of the ionization potential, for more than 60%
of the hyperﬁne constants, and for 22% of the PNC am-
plitude. Here we calculated explicitly only the second
order diagrams but introduced screening coeﬃcients Ck
for the Coulomb lines in these diagrams [11]. The latter
can be calculated as an average screening of the two elec-
tron Coulomb radial integrals of a given multipolarity k.
These coeﬃcients served as an approximation to the in-
sertion of polarization operator in Coulomb lines. The
coeﬃcients Ck were chosen as follows: C0 = C1 = 0.85,
and Ck = 1 for k ≥ 2. With these screening coeﬃ-
cients the Brueckner energies of the orbitals appeared
to be within 1% from the experimental values. Still the
additional corrections were necessary in order to reach
the accuracy better than 1%. Thus, we used the energy
dependence of the self-energy operator σ(ε) to improve
the agreement between calculated energy and the exper-
iment. The optimal one-electron energies ε appeared to
be close to the Brueckner energies of corresponding or-

bitals. In a similar way we chose the energies in the RPA
equations for hyperﬁne and PNC interactions.

The optimal choice of the one-electron energies for
σ(ε) and for RPA matrix elements allowed us to improve
the accuracy for the lower part of the spectrum and for
the hyperﬁne constants. Corresponding corrections were
smaller than 1% for the energies and 1% – 2% for the
hyperﬁne constants. RPA corrections to the E1 ampli-
tudes were much smaller and we did not do any ﬁtting for
them. The RPA equations for weak interaction HP were
solved for the same energies as were used for hyperﬁne
constants. That increased PNC amplitude by 1%.

All observables were calculated using Brueckner or-
bitals and RPA amplitudes. We also calculated two
smaller MBPT corrections to the amplitudes. One of
them is the so called structural radiation and the other
is the normalization correction [3, 4]. The former is typ-
ically of the order of few percent and the latter reduces
the ﬁnal answer by approximately 1%. There are sev-
eral corrections to the PNC amplitude of the same order
of MBPT as these ones. They correspond to the RPA-
type diagrams and to the structural radiation-type dia-
grams with both E1 and PNC vertexes on the inner lines.
These corrections were shown to be negligible [3, 4] and
we omitted them here.

where αi are Dirac matrices and r12 is the distance
between the electrons. The operator V 1
B is called the
Gaunt term and the operator V 2
B is called the retardation
term. For valence electrons the Gaunt term is known to
be about an order of magnitude larger then the second
one [12]. The latter is of the same order as the frequency
dependent corrections to the operator (1) and as other
QED corrections [13]. Therefore, below we neglect the
second term in Eq. (1).

Calculations of Cs are done in the V N −1 approxima-
tion and one needs to calculate Breit interaction between

2

the electron and the closed shells only. It is easy to show
that in this case only the exchange term of the Breit in-
teraction does not turn to zero. This is almost obvious
because for a closed shell hαi = 0. The exchange Breit
interaction can be included in calculation either pertur-
batively or self-consistently. It is known [12, 14] that the
core relaxation results in a screening of Breit interaction
between the innermost core shells and the valence elec-
tron, signiﬁcantly reducing the ﬁnal Breit corrections. In
the self-consistent approach, the potential V core
should
be included in the Dirac-Fock equations. For this pur-
pose we modiﬁed the Dirac-Fock code [10] to allow for
the Coulomb-Breit potential.

B

The self-consistent approach for such observables as
hyperﬁne constants or PNC amplitudes requires the so-
lution of the RPA equations. There are two types of
Breit corrections to these equations. First, one has to
use DFCB orbitals and DFCB orbital energies in RPA
equations. Second, it is necessary to include Breit inter-
action explicitly in two-electron matrix elements. These
types of corrections are of the same order of magnitude
and should be included on equal footing.

Finally, we calculated the the self-energy operator also
using DFCB orbitals and orbital energies. Here we did
not include Breit correction to two-electron matrix ele-
ments in diagrams for the self-energy. These diagrams
arise in the second order in residual Coulomb interaction
and always include two Coulomb lines. If in one of these
lines the Coulomb interaction is changed to the Breit
one, the resultant correction appears to be very small.
The reason is that main Coulomb corrections are asso-
ciated with the interaction of the valence electrons with
the upper core shells, while the most important Breit
interaction is with the innermost core shells.

All calculations with the exception for structural ra-
diation and normalization corrections were repeated two
times in exactly the same manner in Dirac-Coulomb and
Dirac-Coulomb-Breit approximations. That allowed us
to single out Breit corrections even when they were com-
parable to the errors caused by the incompleteness of the
basis set or by the approximations we used to account
for higher order terms of MBPT.

where j = 1/2. This amplitude is sensitive to the energy
spectrum and E1-amplitudes as well as to the matrix el-
ements of the weak interaction HP . The latter depends

on the wave function in the vicinity of the nucleus and
in this respect is similar to the matrix elements of the
hyperﬁne interaction. Thus, in order to estimate the ac-

curacy of the calculation of the PNC amplitude one has
to analyze the accuracy for all these observables.

Tables I and II present our results for the energies and
hyperﬁne constants of the lower levels of Cs. These ta-
bles show results on the diﬀerent stages of calculation in-
cluding the initial Dirac-Fock approximation, the MBPT
and Breit corrections. We also give corrections associ-
ated with the optimization of the energies in MBPT and
RPA calculations as described above.

Breit corrections to E1 amplitudes appear to be mostly
smaller than 0.1%. Similar corrections to scalar polariz-
abilities of the levels 6s and 7s are about −0.1%. These
polarizabilities can be used to calculate the Stark shift
δν6s,7s for the 6s → 7s transition (in Hz/(V/cm)2):

than was assumed in [15] and gave the value β =

Our results for the PNC amplitude are presented in ta-
ble III. Calculations were done for the uniformly charged
nucleus of the radius 6.20 fm. Following [7, 17] we intro-
duced −0.1% correction to account for the diﬀerence in
neutron and charge radii of the nucleus.

We see that ab initio calculation and calculation with
‘optimal’ energies for the self-energy operator and for
RPA amplitudes diﬀers by 1%, i.e. PNC amplitude ap-
pears to be less sensitive to the variation of the energies
used for the self-energy operator σ(ε) and for RPA equa-
tions than the hyperﬁne constants. Thus, we assume that
uncertainty for the PNC amplitude associated with the
ﬁtting is smaller than for the hyperﬁne constants.

Discussion For the Dirac-Coulomb approximation
our value for the PNC amplitude is in a good agreement
with the results of the calculations [3, 4]. Our value of the
Breit correction is approximately two times smaller than
the result of Derevianko. This discrepancy is almost elim-
inated if we add −0.003 correction to his result, which is
caused by the Breit contribution to the energies of atomic
levels. Derevianko argues that this correction should not
be included if one ﬁts the energies semiempirically.

We ﬁrst want to note that calculations [3, 4] did not use
any energy ﬁt. Therefore, Breit correction to these cal-
culations should deﬁnitely include this contribution. In
our calculation we did use the energy ﬁt and thus Dere-
vianko’s argument seems to work here. However, we did

we modiﬁed the MBPT by changing the argument of the
self-energy operator σ(ε). That changed the energies and
the Brueckner orbitals thus aﬀecting the numerators as
well as denominators in Eq. (2). We think that this is a
more consistent way to account for the high orders of the
MBPT. We repeated the energy ﬁt after Breit interaction
was included. That changed Breit corrections to diﬀer-
ent contributions to the PNC amplitude, but the overall
correction still remained −0.4%.

The analysis of the numerical data from Tables I, II
and Eqs. (3) and (4) shows that the energies, the Stark-
shift δν, and even the Stark-induced amplitude β are in
a very good agreement with the experiment. However,
the accuracy for the hyperﬁne constants of the levels 6s
and 6p1/2 is signiﬁcantly lower. In order to improve these
constants we had to make the energy ﬁt which changed

both constants by approximately 2%. The reason for the
low accuracy here is obvious: the MBPT corrections to
A(6s) and A(6p1/2) are 65% and 81% correspondingly.
Taking into account that MBPT correction to the PNC
amplitude is only 22% and that the energy ﬁt changes
this amplitude only by 1%, we estimate our accuracy for
the PNC amplitude to be about 0.5%.

This estimate does not include uncertainties associated
with the nuclear structure and QED corrections. QED
corrections to the hyperﬁne structure and the uncertain-
ties associated with the nuclear magnetic moment dis-
tribution were discussed in [18, 19, 20]. The authors
conclude that there are several corrections on the scale
of 0.1–0.3%.

For the PNC amplitude the vacuum polarization cor-
rection was estimated in [21, 22] to be 0.2–0.4% for
Z = 55. The core relaxation can screen it signiﬁcantly,
as it does with the Breit correction, so it is rather an
order of magnitude estimate of the QED corrections to
the PNC amplitude. Another uncertainty of the order of
0.1–0.2% is caused by the poor knowledge of the neutron
distribution in the nucleus [7, 17].

In our analysis we use Gaunt approximation to Breit
operator while in the paper [8] the retardation term was
also included. This may explain the diﬀerence between
our value 0.004 and the value 0.005 obtained in [8]. As
we mentioned above, the retardation term is of the same
order of magnitude as the frequency-dependent correc-
tions to the Breit operator and as other QED correc-
tions. Therefore, the diﬀerence between our results can
serve as an estimate of the accuracy of Breit approxima-
tion. Thus, the total uncertainty for the PNC amplitude
is about 1% and there is no meaningful diﬀerence with
the standard model. Our ﬁnal value for the weak charge
is:

QW = −72.5(7)

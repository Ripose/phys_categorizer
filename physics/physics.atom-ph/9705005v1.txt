We develop the idea of selectively manipulating the condensate in a trapped Bose-condensed gas, without perturbing
the thermal cloud. The idea is based on the possibility to modify the mean ﬁeld interaction between atoms
(scattering length) by nearly resonant incident light or by spatially uniform change of the trapping magnetic ﬁeld.
For the gas in the Thomas-Fermi regime we ﬁnd analytical scaling solutions for the condensate wavefunction
evolving under arbitrary variations of the scattering length a. The change of a from positive to negative induces a
global collapse of the condensate, and the ﬁnal stages of the collapse will be governed by intrinsic decay processes.

The discovery of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in
trapped clouds of ultra-cold alkali atoms [1–3] opened
unique possibilities to investigate collective many-body
eﬀects in dilute gases. Isolation of a trapped gas from
the environment, provided by a wall-less magnetic con-
ﬁnement, makes this object attractive for studying fun-
damental problems of the physics of many-body quantum
systems, such as relaxation and the loss of coherence in
the evolving macroscopic quantum state (condensate).
In ongoing experiments [4–8] the condensate is set into
motion (for example, undergoes oscillations) by varying
the conﬁning ﬁeld. Scaling theory of coherent evolution
(without damping and relaxation) of a Bose condensate
in harmonic traps under arbitrary frequency variations
has been developed in [9,10]. It is important, however,
that variations of the conﬁning potential also cause the
evolution of the thermal component of a trapped gas.
Moreover, in the hydrodynamic regime the thermal cloud
in many aspects evolves similarly to the condensate [9].
For example, the asymmetry of free expansion and eigen-
frequencies of small oscillations are almost the same.

In this paper we develop the idea of selectively manip-
ulating the condensate, without perturbing the thermal
cloud. This is especially important for studying the in-
teraction between the condensate and the thermal com-
ponent. The idea is based on the possibility to mod-
ify the mean ﬁeld interaction between atoms. At low
temperatures the latter is proportional to the scattering
length a which, as found in [11], can be changed under
the inﬂuence of red-detuned nearly resonant light. An-
other option to modify the scattering length relies on the
magnetic ﬁeld dependence of a, predicted in [12], and as-
sumes spatially uniform variations of the trapping ﬁeld,
without changing the trap frequencies. Since the shape
of the condensate wavefunction is predetermined by the
interaction between particles, the change of a will cause
the evolution of the condensate at constant frequencies
of the conﬁning potential. Remarkably, at temperatures
n ˜U (n is the gas density, ˜U = 4π¯h2a/m, and m
T
the atom mass) only the condensate evolution will be
pronounced, which resembles the picture of the fourth

the shape of the thermal cloud is mainly determined by
the trapping potential and temperature. The perturba-
tion of the thermal component will be small compared to
that of the condensate, at least as n ˜U /T .

The change of a in the ﬁeld of nearly resonant red-
detuned light is provided by virtual radiative transitions
of a pair of atoms to a bound electronically excited molec-
ular state. Since the resonance dipole interaction be-
tween atoms in the excited state is much stronger than
the interaction in the ground state, already for moderate
light intensities the eﬀective interatomic interaction and,
hence, the scattering length can be signiﬁcantly changed.
It is even possible to switch the sign of a [11].

The magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the scattering length,
found in [12], has a resonance structure. Therefore, spa-
tially uniform variations of the ﬁeld can also change a
substantially and reverse its sign.

Below we ﬁnd analytical scaling solutions for the con-
densate wavefunction evolving under arbitrary variations
of the scattering length. We consider the most inter-
esting situation, where the mean ﬁeld interaction be-
tween atoms greatly exceeds the level spacing in the trap
(Thomas-Fermi regime). The case of switching a from
positive to negative and inducing a global collapse of the
condensate is specially analyzed.

Let us consider the evolution of a condensate in a har-
monic potential V (r) = m

in the spatial region where the argument of the square
root is positive and zero otherwise. Thus, the conden-
sate evolution under arbitrary variations of the scatter-
ing length is described by a universal scaling solution for
Ψ0(r, t), following from Eqs. (2) and (6). Actually, the
problem is reduced to the solution of classical equations
(4) for the scaling parameters bi(t) (cf. [9]).

We should emphasize that the results for d = 2, ob-
tained below, can be applied equally well to the radial
evolution of Ψ0 in very long samples where the axial fre-
quency is much smaller than the radial one. This follows
from the fact that then to a ﬁrst approximation the de-
pendence of Ψ0 on the axial coordinate can be omitted.

tity µ1 = µ0γ2/(2+d)
is equal to the chemical potential of
the gas with the interparticle interaction ˜U1. Then, from
Eqs. (6) and (2) one can see that the initial condensate is
adiabatically transformed to the static condensate with
the wavefunction corresponding to the interaction ˜U1.

In fact, for γ1 = ˜U1/ ˜U0 > 0 these equations are similar to
those for the scaling parameters of the condensate evo-
lution after an abrupt change of the trapping potential,
with initial frequencies being ωi√γ1 and ﬁnal frequen-
cies ωi (see [9]). The solution of Eqs.(8) gives oscillating
functions bi(t) which ensure undamped oscillations of the
condensate wavefunction. For γ1 close to 1 the frequency
spectrum of the condensate oscillations coincides with
the set of eigenfrequencies of small shape oscillations of
the initial condensate, found for cylindrically symmetric
traps in the JILA [4] and MIT [7] experiments and cal-
culated in [15,16,10,9]. It is important that an abrupt
change of the scattering length is equivalent to equal rel-
ative change of all frequencies. This reduces the possibil-
ity of stochastization of the condensate evolution in an
anisotropic harmonic potential, compared to the case of
independent change of the frequencies.

The structure of the condensate oscillations caused by
the change of the scattering length can be easily analyzed
in the case of isotripic trapping conﬁguration. For d = 2
Eq.(8) has analytical solution

Once the scattering length is decreased (γ1 < 1) there
will be ”compression oscillations”: Compression of the
condensate will be followed by its expansion to the ini-
tial shape. An increase of a (γ1 > 1) induces ”expansion
oscillations”, i.e. the condensate is expanding and then
compressing to the initial shape. In both cases the scal-
ing parameter b varies from 1 to √γ1. In the 3-d case
the condensate oscillations are anharmonic, with a char-
acteristic period somewhat smaller than that for d = 2.
The parameter b is varying from 1 to

2γ1/3.

The dynamics of the system, induced by the change of
the interparticle interaction, is drastically diﬀerent from
that caused by variations of the trap frequencies. In the
former case the condensate oscillates, whereas the ther-
mal component is only weakly perturbed and practically
remains static.
In the latter case the thermal cloud is
fully involved in the oscillatory evolution process. Pref-
erential evolution of the condensate under the change of

2

the scattering length resembles the fourth sound in super-
ﬂuid helium, where the superﬂuid part of the density os-
cillates on the background of a static normal component.
As well as in helium, the analysis of dynamic properties
of a trapped gas in these conditions can be an eﬀective
method of identifying and studying BEC.

The change of the interaction between particles can
lead to an interesting phenomenon, a global collapse of
the condensate as a whole. Let us assume that initially
the scattering length a > 0, and the system is in a sta-
tionary state. The sign of a can be switched to negative
in the ﬁeld of nearly resonant red-detuned light [11] or
by spatially uniform variations of the conﬁning magnetic
ﬁeld (see [12]). Then, for an abrupt change of a the solu-
tion of scaling equations (8) immediately leads to a self-
compression (collapse) of the condensate. In the d = 2
isotropic case this directly follows from the exact solu-
tion (9): For γ1 < 0 the scaling parameter b decreases
and reaches zero at t = t∗, where

In both cases the compression rate increases with de-
creasing ∆t: The quantity ˙b(t)/b(t) = 2/[(d + 2)∆t], and
the characteristic velocity of the condensate boundary,
[∆t]−d/(d+2). In the course of collapse the small pa-
v
rameter ε(t) remains constant (d = 2) or even decreases
(d = 3), which justiﬁes the neglect of the kinetic energy
term in Eq.(5). The kinetic energy of the system is de-
termined by the behavior of the phase Φ(r) (3) which
drastically increases with decreasing ∆t. A strong rise
of the kinetic energy in the course of collapse is com-
pensated by decreasing potential energy (a < 0), which
ensures the conservation of the total energy.

The increase of density in the collapsing condensate
enhances intrinsic inelastic processes, such as three-body
recombination and spin-dipole relaxation in binary colli-
sions. This leads to particle losses, since fast atoms and
molecules produced in the inelastic processes escape from
the trap. We will conﬁne ourselves to the analysis of the
inﬂuence of inelastic processes on the dynamics of col-
lapse in the isotropic d = 2 and d = 3 cases. The atom
loss rate is determined by the relation

cm3/s and αr ∼
1014 cm−3 (cur-
initial condensate densities n0 ∼
rently achieved in Rb and Na BEC experiments [4–8]),
we see that already for moderate compression of the con-
densate three-body recombination dominates over spin
relaxation. Therefore, the process of spin relaxation is
omitted in the further analysis. For the same reason, in
the case of light-induced change of the scattering length
we omit the process of photoassociation in pair collisions.
The loss of particles from the condensate inﬂuences the
evolution of the condensate wavefunction. The character
of the evolution depends on the density of the collaps-
ing condensate, n(t), and is predetermined by the re-
lation between the characteristic time of three-body re-

The above described picture of collapse is somewhat

unchanged. The scenario of collapse can be observed by
measuring the recombination losses of particles.

Considering the global collapse in an anisotropic har-
monic potential we should return to scaling equations
(8), with γ1 < 0. The rate of the self-compression is the
highest in the direction corresponding to the largest fre-
quency. In the case of cylindrical symmetry with the ratio
of the axial to radial frequency, β = ωz/ωρ < 1, there will
be a characteristic time t∗ at which bρ(t∗) = 0, but bz(t∗)
1,
remaines ﬁnite. In the time interval, where bρ(t)
Eq.(8) for bρ(t) is reduced to that for the isotropic 2-d
collapse, with γ1 replaced by γ1/bz(t∗). Thus, the global
collapse will occur along the lines of the above described

≪

2-d scenario, in combination with a “slow” compression
in the axial direction. For β > 1 the condensate pre-
dominantly collapses in the axial direction and, due to a
quasi-one-dimensional character of the self-compression,
the kinetic energy term in Eq.(5) increases. Eventually
the parameter ε(t) becomes of order unity, and our scal-
ing approach breaks down. Such a rise of the kinetic
energy prevents the further compression and can lead to
a non-trivial oscillatory character of the global collapse.
Density ﬂuctuations on the background of the global
collapse can lead to the appearence of local collapses,
with linear dimensions of order the healing length. Al-
though their inﬂuence on the global collapse can be re-
duced by decreasing the ratio n0 ˜U /¯hω, the study of the
role of the local collapses requires a separate analysis.

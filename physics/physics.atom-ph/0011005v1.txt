(February 2, 2008)

We report on experiments on an evanescent-wave mirror
for cold 87Rb atoms. Measurements of the bouncing fraction
show the importance of the Van der Waals attraction to the
surface. We have directly observed radiation pressure parallel
to the surface, exerted on the atoms by the evanescent-wave
mirror. We analyze the radiation pressure by imaging the
motion of the atom cloud after the bounce. The number of
photon recoils ranges from 2 to 31. This is independent of
laser power, inversely proportional to the detuning and pro-
portional to the evanescent-wave decay length. By operating
the mirror on an open transition, we have also observed atoms
that bounce inelastically due to a spontaneous Raman tran-
sition. The observed distributions consist of a dense peak at
the minimum velocity and a long tail of faster atoms, show-
ing that the transition is a stochastic process with a strong
preference to occur near the turning point of the bounce.

I. INTRODUCTION

The use of evanescent waves (EW) as a tool to manip-
ulate the motion of neutral atoms has been proposed by
Cook and Hill [1]. Since then, EW mirrors have become
an important tool in atom optics [2]. They have been
demonstrated for atomic beams at grazing incidence [3]
and for ultracold atoms at normal incidence [4]. In many
experiments the scattering of EW photons was undesir-
able because it makes the mirror incoherent.

However, an EW mirror is also a promising tool for eﬃ-
cient loading of low-dimensional optical atom traps in the
vicinity of the dielectric surface [5–8]. In these schemes,
spontaneous optical transitions play a crucial role in pro-
viding dissipation [9–11]. Since inelastic bouncing may
increase the atomic phase-space density, this may open a
route towards quantum degenerate gases, which does not
use evaporative cooling. Thus one may hope to achieve
“atom lasers” [12] which are open, driven systems out of
thermal equilibrium, similar to optical lasers [13]. It is
this application of EW mirrors which drives our inter-
est in experimental control of the photon scattering of
bouncing atoms.

In a ﬁrst experiment involving the scattering of evanes-
cent photons we have observed directly for the ﬁrst time
the radiation pressure exerted by evanescent waves on

cold atoms [14].
In a second experiment we directly
observe clouds of atoms which bounce inelastically by
changing their hyperﬁne ground state.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

FIG. 1. Experimental setup. (a) Cold 87Rb atoms (MOT),
are released 6.6 mm above a right-angle prism. An evanescent
wave is created by beam EW. Fluorescence from probe beam
P is imaged onto a CCD camera. (b) Confocal relay telescope
for adjusting the angle of incidence θ. The lenses L1
2 have
equal focal length, f = 75 mm. A translation of L1 by a
distance ∆a changes the angle of incidence by ∆θ = ∆a/f n.
The position of the EW spot remains ﬁxed. M is a mirror.

,

Our experiments are performed in a vapor cell. Ap-
proximately 107 atoms of 87Rb are loaded out of the
background vapor into a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
and are subsequently cooled to 10 µK using polarization
gradient cooling (optical molasses). The cold atom cloud
is released in the F = 2 ground state. After a free fall
of 6.6 mm the atoms reach the horizontal surface of a
right-angle BK7 prism (refractive index n = 1.51), see
Fig. 1(a).

The EW beam emerges from a single-mode optical

1

ﬁber, is collimated and directed into the prism through
a relay telescope, see Fig. 1(b). The angle of incidence θ
is controlled by the vertical displacement ∆a of the ﬁrst
lens L1. The second lens L2 images the beam to a ﬁxed
spot at the prism surface. A displacement ∆a changes
the angle by ∆θ = ∆a/nf . The beam has a minimum
waist of 335 µm at the surface (1/e2 intensity radius)
and a nearly diﬀraction limited divergence half-angle of
< 1 mrad.

For the EW, an injection-locked single mode laser
diode provides up to 28 mW of optical power behind
the ﬁber.
It is seeded by an external grating stabi-
lized diode laser, locked to the 87Rb hyperﬁne transition
5S1/2(F = 2) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 3) of the D2 line. The
detuning with respect to this transition determines the
optical potential for atoms released from the MOT in the
F = 2 ground state.

III. VAN DER WAALS SURFACE ATTRACTION

The EW ﬁeld is E (r) ∝ exp(ikxx) exp(−κz), with
kx = k0n sin θ and κ = k0pn2 sin2 θ − 1, where k0 =
2π/λ0 is the vacuum wave number. The optical dipole
potential for a two-level atom can be written as Udip(z) =
U0 exp(−2κz). In the limit of large detuning, |δ| ≫ Γ,
and low saturation, s0 ≪ 1, the maximum potential at
the surface is U0 = ¯hδs0/2, with a saturation parameter
s0 ≃ (Γ/2δ)2 T I/I0 [15]. Here I is the intensity of the in-
cident beam inside the prism, I0 = 1.65 mW/cm2 is the
saturation intensity for rubidium and Γ = 2π × 6.0 MHz
is the natural linewidth. The factor T ranges from 5.4 –
6.0 (2.5 – 2.65) for a TM (TE) polarized EW [16]. The
detuning of the laser frequency ωL with respect to the
atomic transition frequency ω0 is deﬁned as δ = ωL − ω0.
Thus a “blue” detuning (δ > 0) yields an exponential
potential barrier for incoming atoms. A classical turn-
ing point exists if the barrier height exceeds the kinetic
energy p2

i /2M of an incident atom.

In reality, the barrier height is determined not only
by the dipole potential. The attractive Van der Waals
potential near the surface,

UvdW(z) = −

3(n2 − 1)
16(n2 + 1)

¯hΓ
(k0z)3 .

(1)

lowers the maximum potential and thus decreases the
surface area on which atoms can bounce [17]. Gravity
can usually be neglected on the length scale of the EW
decay length.

We have measured the fraction of bouncing atoms us-
ing a weak resonant probe beam, inserted between the
MOT position and the surface. Time-of-ﬂight signals
were recorded on a photodiode and the integrated ab-
sorption signal was measured for both falling and bounc-
ing atoms. The extracted fractions of bouncing atoms
are shown in Fig. 2, as a function of the strength of the
optical potential U0. The logarithmic dependence is a

2

consequence of the gaussian beam proﬁle of the EW. Also
shown are two calculations of the bouncing fraction using
no adjustable parameters, (i) assuming a purely optical
potential (dashed line), and (ii) taking into account also
the Van der Waals surface attraction (solid line). The
latter clearly yields much better agreement. Similar mea-
surements have previously been performed by Landragin
et al. [17].

IV. RADIATION PRESSURE BY EVANESCENT

WAVES

The evanescent wavevector k = (kx, 0, iκ) contains a
real (propagating) component along the surface. It has
been predicted already by Roosen and Imbert [18] that
therefore an evanescent wave should exert radiation pres-
sure parallel to the surface. A similar scattering force
has been observed for micrometer-sized dielectric spheres
[19]. The photon scattering rate of a two-level atom in
steady state at low saturation is Γ′ ≈ sΓ/2 = (Γ/¯hδ) Udip
[15]. An atom bouncing on an EW mirror sees a time de-
pendent saturation parameter s(t). Assuming that the
excited state population follows adiabatically, we can in-
tegrate the scattering rate along an atom’s trajectory to
get the number of scattered photons, Nscat = R Γ′(t)dt.
For a purely optical potential this leads to an analytical
solution:

Nscat =

Γ
δ

¯hκ

.

(2)

Note that Nscat is independent of U0, as a consequence
of the exponential shape of the potential.

We have observed this evanescent-wave radiation pres-
sure directly by imaging the bouncing atom clouds [14].
The ﬂuorescence induced by a 0.5 ms pulse of resonant

probe light was imaged onto a digital frame-transfer CCD
camera. A repumping beam, tuned to the F = 1 → F ′ =
2 transition of the D1 line (795 nm), was used to coun-
teract optical pumping to the F = 1 ground state by the
probe.

We measure the trajectories of bouncing atoms by tak-
ing a sequence of images with incremental time delays.
A typical series with increments of 10 ms is shown in
Fig. 3. A new sample was prepared for each shot; each
image was averaged over 10 shots. In the lower half of
the Figure we see the atom cloud bouncing up slightly
sideways.

observe a change in center of mass motion of the clouds
due to an increase in the spontaneous scattering force.
Such a contribution to the radiation pressure due to sur-
face roughness vanishes in the limit of large detuning δ.
Thus, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant oﬀset in Fig. 4(a).

FIG. 4. Radiation pressure on bouncing atoms expressed
as number of absorbed photons, Nscat. (a) Detuning δ varied
for ξ = 2.8 µm (open points) and 0.67 µm (solid points). (b)
EW decay length ξ varied for δ = 44 Γ. The laser power
was 19 mW. The thin solid line is a linear ﬁt through the ﬁrst
four data points. Theoretical predictions: two-level atom (see
Eq. (2), thick solid lines). Excited-state hyperﬁne structure
and saturation taken into account (dashed lines).

We have also veriﬁed that there is no signiﬁcant de-
pendence on the power of the EW, in accordance with
Eq. (2). Only a slight increase with EW power is ob-
served, which may again be due to diﬀusely scattered
light. The optical power mainly determines the eﬀective
mirror surface and thus the fraction of bouncing atoms.
This is also visible in the horizontal width of bouncing
clouds.

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correction due to the excited state
manifold F ′ = {0, 1, 2, 3} of 87Rb. Besides F ′ = 3, also
F ′ = 1, 2 contribute to the mirror potential, whereas
they do not much aﬀect the scattering rate. For an EW
detuning of 44 Γ, this reduces the number of scattered
photons by typically 9 % compared to a two-level atom,
when we average over the contributions from diﬀerent
magnetic sublevels (dashed lines).

V. INELASTIC BOUNCING

If the mirror laser is tuned to an open transition, pho-
ton scattering can lead to a spontaneous Raman transi-
tion to the other hyperﬁne ground state. The atom will
then leave the surface on a diﬀerent potential curve from
when it approached the surface. Hence, the kinetic en-
ergy after the bounce will in general be diﬀerent from
that before the bounce.

We performed experiments where the EW laser was
tuned in the blue wing of the F = 1 → F ′ = 2 transition
of the D2 line of 87Rb, with a detuning δ1 ≪ δGHF, with

FIG. 3. Fluorescence images of a bouncing atom cloud.
The ﬁrst image was taken 5 ms after releasing the atoms from
the MOT. The conﬁguration of prism and evanescent wave is
illustrated by the schematic (Field of view: 10.2 × 10.2 mm2).

The horizontal velocity change during the bounce is
extracted from a sequence of images. In Fig. 4, we show
how this velocity kick depends on the laser detuning δ
and on the EW decay length ξ ≡ 1/κ(θ), by varying the
angle θ. The velocity kick has been expressed in units of
the EW photon recoil, prec = ¯hk0n sin θ, with ¯hk0/M =
5.88 mm/s. In Fig. 4(a), the detuning is varied from 188
– 1400 MHz (31 – 233 Γ). Two sets of data are shown,
taken for two diﬀerent EW decay lengths ξ = 2.8 µm and
0.67 µm. We ﬁnd that Nscat ∝ δ−1, as expected. The
predictions based on Eq. (2) are indicated in the ﬁgure
(solid lines).

In Fig. 4(b), the detuning was kept ﬁxed at 44 Γ and
the angle of incidence varied from 0.9 – 24.0 mrad above
the critical angle. This leads to a variation of decay
length ξ from 2.8 – 0.53 µm. Here also, we ﬁnd a linear
dependence on ξ. Clearly, a steep optical potential, i.e. a
small decay length, causes less radiation pressure than a
shallow potential. A linear ﬁt to the data for ξ < 1 µm,
extrapolates to an oﬀset of approximately 3 photon re-
coils in the limit ξ → 0 [thin solid line in Fig. 4(b)]. We
attribute this oﬀset to diﬀusely scattered EW light due to
roughness of the prism surface which propagates into the
vacuum. Preferential light scattering in the direction of
the EW propagation can be explained if the power spec-
trum of the surface roughness is narrow compared to 1/λ
[20]. The eﬀect of surface roughness has previously been
observed as a broadening of bouncing atom clouds by
the roughness of the dipole potential [21]. In our case, we

Atoms in F = 2 see the EW mirror with a detuning which
is larger by a factor of approximately δ2/δ1 ≈ δGHF/δ1
and therefore see a much weaker potential. Thus they
leave the surface with a reduced kinetic energy. Repeat-
ing this procedure leads to so-called “evanescent-wave
cooling” [9–11].

FIG. 5. Absorption image of atoms bouncing inelastically
from an evanescent-wave mirror. The image was taken 14 ms
after the bounce. The ﬁeld of view is 3.4 × 5.1 mm2.

We observe the inelastically bouncing atoms directly
by imaging the absorption of a weak resonant probe pulse
onto a digital CCD camera.
In Fig. 5 we show a typ-
ical image, taken when the slowest atoms have reached
their upper turning point. The observed clouds are highly
asymmetric, with a dense peak at the lower edge of the
cloud and a tail of faster atoms extending upward. The
dense peak contains the atoms that made the Raman
transition near the turning point, because here they move
slowly in a relatively high light intensity. The tail con-
tains faster atoms, which have made the Raman tran-
sition while falling down to, or bouncing up from the
surface. The density distribution in the vertical direc-
tion agrees well with a calculation where the atoms are
modeled as point particles moving on an exponential po-
tential curve.

VI. OUTLOOK

The result of the inelastic bouncing experiment shows
the preference for making a spontaneous Raman tran-
sition near the turning point of the bounce. This is of
great importance for our ongoing experiments which are
aimed at trapping the cold atoms near the turning point,
in a low-dimensional optical trap. Although the present
experiment showed a relatively high density at the lowest
possible bouncing velocity, it is unlikely that the phase-
space density has been increased. It remains to be inves-

tigated under what conditions such an increase can be
obtained and by how much.

The scattering of evanescent photons is an essen-
tial ingredient in our experiment toward loading low-
dimensional optical traps. At the same time, once loaded
into the trap, we wish the atoms to scatter at a very low
rate. In order to meet these conﬂicting requirements our
present experiments are aimed at trapping the atoms in
a so-called dark state which no longer interacts with the
evanescent wave. This requires the use of circularly po-
larized evanescent waves. This procedure should lead
to an ultracold low-dimensional gas and may ultimately
yield an all-optical road to quantum-degeneracy and an
atom laser.

Abstract

We have used the convergent close-coupling method and a unitarized ﬁrst-

order many-body theory to calculate integral cross sections for elastic scatter-

ing and momentum transfer, for excitation of the 5d2 1S, 6s6p 1P1, 6s7p 1P1,

6s8p 1P1, 6s5d 1D2, 5d2 1D2, 6s6d 1D2, 6p5d 1F3, 6s4f 1F3, 6p5d 1D2,

6s6p 3P0,1,2, 6s5d 3D1,2,3, and 6p5d 3D2 states, for ionization and for to-

tal scattering by electron impact on the ground state of barium at incident

electron energies from 1 to 1000 eV. These results and all available experi-

mental data have been combined to produce a recommended set of integral

cross sections.

I. INTRODUCTION

A great deal of interest and need has developed in recent years for electron collision cross

sections involving Ba atoms. In the applications area, these cross sections are needed for

modelling the behavior of Ba vapor lasers [1–4], discharge lamps [5], plasma switches [6], and

various planetary ionospheres [7–12], where Ba has often been used as a trace element for

diagnostic purposes. On the academic side, benchmark laboratory cross sections are needed

for testing various theoretical approximations and calculational methods hoping to predict

these cross sections.

The experimental data base, available at the present time, is rather limited both in

the electron impact energy range and the scattering channels. Line emission cross sections

for the (6s6p 1P1 → 6s2 1S0) at 5535 ˚A [Qemiss(6s6p 1P1)] were determined by Chen and

Gallagher [13] in the 2.3 to 1497.0 eV impact energy range. They claimed an uncertainty

of ±5 %. Since the 6s6p 1P1 level decays predominantly (99.7%) to the ground state, the

measured line emission cross sections are equivalent (within the experimental error limits) to

the apparent 6s6p 1P1 level excitation cross sections [QApp(6s6p 1P1)] and they diﬀer from the

electron impact excitation cross sections [Q(6s6p 1P1)] by the cascade contributions. (See e.g.

Trajmar and Nickel [14] for the deﬁnitions of these cross sections.) Cascade corrections, only

available from theory, can be applied to the data of Chen and Gallagher and the resulting

Q(6s6p 1P1) values represent the most reliable electron scattering cross sections available

for Ba at the present time. Jensen et al. [15] and Wang et al. [16] determined relative

cross sections for elastic scattering (Qelas) and momentum transfer (QM ) at a few impact

energies. Jensen et al. [15] also obtained some cross section results for excitation of the

6s5d 1D2 level [Q(6s5d 1D2)]. In these cases, the relative cross sections were normalized by

an estimated cascade correction applied to the Chen and Gallagher QApp(6s6p 1P1) values to

obtain Q(6s6p 1P1) values which in turn were used to normalize Qelas, QM , and Q(6s5d 1D2).

Total ionization cross section (Qi) in the threshold to 600 eV range have been reported by

Dettmann and Karstensen [17] and by Vainshtein et al. [18] from the threshold to 200 eV.

2

Total electron scattering cross sections (QTot) were measured by Romanyuk et al. [19] in the

0.1 to 10 eV range.

There is a larger data base available from calculations. Elastic scattering cross sections

were calculated by Gregory and Fink [20] in the 100 to 1500 eV range. (numerical solutions

of the Dirac equation), by Fabrikant [21] at impact energies ranging from 6 eV to 35 eV

(non-relativistic close-coupling approximation), by Yuan and Zhang from 0.01 eV to 5.0 eV

(quasirelativistic static-exchange formalism) [22] and from 0.04 eV to 150 eV (Hartree-Fock

method with relativistic corrections) [23], by Szmytkowski and Sienkiewicz [24] in the 0.2

eV to 100 eV region (relativistic polarized-orbital approximation) and by Kelemen et al.

[25] from 0.1 to 200 eV (using phenomenological complex opical potential). Szmytkowski

and Sienkiewicz [24] and Kelemen et al. [25] as well as Gribakin et al. [26] (Hartree-Fock

approximation with correlation corrections, from zero to 2.5 eV) have reported momentum

transfer cross sections. As far as inelastic scattering is concerned, Q(6s6p 1P1) results

were obtained by Fabrikant [21] from threshold to 35 eV (non-relativistic two-state close-

coupling approximation), by Clark et al. [27] from 5 eV to 100 eV (unitarized distorted-wave

approximation, UDWA and ﬁrst order many-body theory, FOMBT), and Srivastava et al.

[28,29] from 20 to 100 eV (relativistic distorted-wave approximation, RDWA). Srivastava

et al.also reported Q(6s6p 3P1) and Q(6s5d 1D2) and Q(6s5d 3D1,2,3) values. QTot results in

the 10 to 200 eV range were given by Kelemen et al. [25]. Very recently the non-relativistic

convergent close-coupling (CCC) method was applied by Fursa and Bray [30,31] to obtain

Qelas, QM , Q(6s6p 3P1), Q(6s5d 1D2) and QApp(6s6p 1P1) results in the 1 to 897 eV range.

The present work represents a substantial extension of CCC and UFOMBT calculations

to cover all scattering channels which we consider important for practical applications over

a wide range of impact energies. Comparison of these theoretical results with fragmentary

experimental data allows us to recommend a reliable and consistent cross section data set

which should be satisfactory for most modelling calculations. We found very good agree-

ment between the CCC results and experiment and therefore in our recommendations relied

heavily on the CCC data.

II. CALCULATIONAL METHODS

A. CCC method

The application of the CCC method to calculation of electron scattering from barium

has been discussed elsewhere, see Refs. [31] and [32] for details. Brieﬂy, barium target

states are described by a model of two valence electrons above an inert Hartree-Fock core.

We have used conﬁguration interaction (CI) expansion technique to obtain barium wave

functions. One-electron orbitals used in CI expansion have been obtained by diagonalizing

Ba+ Hamiltonian in a Sturmian (Laguerre) basis. In Table I we compare energies for the

states relevant to the present study with experimental data and give a set of the dominant

conﬁgurations for each state. We ﬁnd a very good agreement between our results and

experiment and other accurate calculations for energy levels and oscillator strengths [31].

The barium target states obtained this way provide not only an accurate representation of

the barium discrete spectrum but allow also for square-integrable representation of the target

continuum. This allows for coupling to the ionization channels in the scattering calculations.

These calculations use barium target states in order to perform expansion of the total wave

function and formulate a set of close-coupling equations. These equations (for the T matrix)

are formulated and solved in momentum space.

The CCC method is formulated as a purely non-relativistic theory in both target

structure and electron scattering calculations. In order to compare results from the non-

relativistic CCC calculations with experiment, we have used a technique essentially identical

with the transformation scheme described by Saraph [33]. Namely, we ﬁrst transform the

non-relativistic CCC scattering amplitudes f S

πf sf lf mf ,πisilimi to the amplitudes describing

transitions between ﬁne-structure levels Jf and Ji,

frame, respectively. The ﬁnal (initial) projectile spin projection on the Z-axis of the collision

frame is indicated as σf (σi) , and the index γ distinguishes states with the same orbital

angular momentum, spin and parity. The above amplitudes are used to form amplitudes in

the intermediate coupling scheme

γ by diagonalizing the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian

(only one-body spin-orbit term is used) in the basis of the barium target states obtained

from the non-relativistic barium structure calculation. Note that the dependence of the

scattering amplitudes in (1) and (2) on the electron spherical angles θ and ϕ is implicit.

Amplitudes (2) are used to calculate the semi-relativistic integrated cross sections:

The subscript “fs” (ﬁne-structure) indicates that the cross section is calculated with an

(approximate) account of relativistic corrections.

Scattering on a singlet initial state allows for signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation in Eq. (3). Sym-

ensure that the singlet-triplet terms in Eq. (3) are zero after summation over projectile spin

magnetic sublevels mf and mi. We have also found that for the target states involved in

the present study only one or two terms in Eq. (2) have large mixing coeﬃcients. Together,

these allow us to express the cross section deﬁned by (3) in terms of the non-relativistic cross

sections Q which are obtained from the non-relativistic amplitudes (1) using Eq. (3). We

give below decomposition of the semi-relativistic ICS (3) via non-relativistic cross sections,

These cross sections typically diﬀer by less than 3% from the corresponding cross sections

obtained from Eq. (3). All other target states are well described in the non-relativistic

approximation.

B. UFOMBT method

The UFOMBT method used here has been discussed in general and in particular its

implementation for Ba by Clark et al. [27] and Zetner et al. [34].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Line emission, apparent level excitation and electron impact excitation cross

section for the 6s6p 1P1 level

At the present time, the most reliable electron collision cross sections for Ba are the

5535 ˚A line emission cross sections [Qemiss(6s6p 1P1)] associated with the radiative decay of

the electron impact and cascade populated 6s6p 1P1 level to the ground 6s2 1S0 state as

measured by Chen and Galagher [13]. The uncertainty claimed for these cross sections is

about ±5% over the 2.3 to 1497 eV impact energy range. As mentioned in the Introduction,

6

for all practical purposes these emission cross sections are equivalent to the apparent level

excitation cross sections [QApp(6s6p 1P1)] from which the electron impact excitation cross

sections [Q(6s6p 1P1)] can be derived if proper account for the cascade contributions can be

made. These cross sections can be used as standards to normalize other electron collision

cross sections obtained from relative measurements.

Indeed, this procedure was followed

by Jensen et al. [15] and Wang et al. [16] who assumed very approximate cascade contri-

butions. A better estimate of these cascade contributions can be made based on the CCC

calculations. We will follow here this latter procedure. In Fig. 1 QApp(6s6p 1P1 ) values

measured by Chen and Gallagher and those obtained from the CCC and CC(55) calculations

(by adding the direct and cascade contributions) are shown. Fig. 2 shows the calculated

cascade contribution. Chen and Gallagher have used the Bethe-Born theory to normalize

their relative measurements at high energy. They used the value of the optical oscillator

strength f = 1.59 a.u. for the 6s2 1S0- 6s6p 1P1 transition. This value is now known more

accurately, f = 1.64 a.u. [35]. We, therefore, have multiplied the cross section values given

by Chen and Gallagher by the ratio of the latter and former optical oscillator strengths. The

excellent agreement between experiment and the CCC results gives credence to the CCC

method and some assurance that the Q(6s6p 1P1) cross sections from these calculations are

reliable. In Fig. 3, we compare these cross sections with those obtained from the Chen and

Gallagher QApp(6s6p 1P1 ) and the results obtained from other calculational methods. As

can be seen from Fig. 3, the calculational methods converge at higher impact energies (above

few hundreds eV) but only the CCC results can be considered reliable at intermediate and

low impact energies. The set of recommended cross sections are given in Table II. The

apparent cross sections are those of Chen and Gallagher, marginally renormalized by mul-

tiplication by 1.03 as discussed above. The ratio of Qcascade/QApp has been evaluated using

the CCC and CC(55) results. Both recommended cascade Qcascade and direct Q(6s6p1P1)

cross sections have been obtained from the apparent cross sections with the utilization of

the CCC Qcascade/QApp ratio.

7

B. Other inelastic scattering channels

In all UFOMBT calculations except for the excitation of the 6s4f 1F3 and the 6p5d 1D2

levels the 22 conﬁgurational basis set described in Zetner et al. [34] was used.

Apparent level excitation and electron impact excitation cross sections for the 6s7p 1P1

and 6s8p 1P1 levels, obtained from CCC, CC(55) and UFOMBT calculations, are shown in

Figs. 4, 5 and 6, 7, respectively. No experimental data or other theoretical results are avail-

able for these excitation processes. The recommended cross sections are listed in Table III.

These values correspond to the CCC results. No recommended cross sections are given

below 5.0 eV since the present implementation of the CCC method is too computationally

expensive to study resonance regions.

Electron impact excitation cross sections for the 5d2 1S0 level and 1D2 levels associated

with the 6s5d, 5d2,and 6s6d major conﬁgurations are given in Figs.

8, 9, 10, and 11,

respectively. We did not include the very approximate Q(6s5d 1D2) values of Jensen et al.

[15] in Fig. 9. No other results are available and again, we give our recommended cross

sections based on the CCC calculations in Table IV.

Other important excitation channels are associated with the 6p5d 1D2, 6p5d 1F3, 6s4f 1F3

and 6p5d 3D2 levels. The theoretical results for these cross sections are shown in Figs. 12,

13, 14, and 15, respectively and the recommended values are listed in Table V.

Excitation of triplet levels are given for the 6s6p 3PJ (J = 0, 1 and 2), 6s5d 3DJ (J = 1, 2

and 3). Only theoretical cross sections are available and they are shown in Figs. 16-18 and

19-21, respectively The recommended values are summarized in Table VI.

Comparing CCC and UFOMBT results we generally ﬁnd good agreement at high incident

electron energies. However for a few transitions we observe substantial discrepancies even

at high impact energies. For the 6p5d 1F3 state this discrepancy is the result of the small,

but important diﬀerence in the CI mixing coeﬃcients for the nf 6s 1F3 conﬁguration. We

ﬁnd that the nf 6s 1F3 conﬁguration contributes most to the ICS, specially at high energies.

We gave preference to the CCC results in this case, because it is likely that the structure

8

calculations performed in the UFOBT method has not converged for this state. Similarly,

for the 6s5d 3D2 level a small diﬀerence in the singlet-triplet mixing coeﬃcient between

6s5d 3D2 and 6s5d 1D2 conﬁgurations leads to some diﬀerences between CCC and UFOMBT

calculations at high energies.

The enormous diﬀerence between CCC and UFOMBT results for 6p5d 1D2 and 6p5d 3D2

levels has nothing to do with diﬀerences in the structure models but comes from the diﬀer-

ence in the scattering calculations. In a ﬁrst order theory, like UFOMBT, in nonrelativistic

approximation the excitation of both 6p5d 1D2 and 6p5d 3D2 levels from the 6s2 1S gound

state can occur by exchange scattering only. As incident electron energy increases, the

exchange scattering decreases which leads to very small values of the excitation cross sec-

tion. Account of relativistic corrections in UFOMBT does not change this situation because

the singlet-triplet mixing in the ground state is negligible, while the singlet-triplet mixing

for 6p5d 1D2 and 6p5d 3D2 levels brings contributions from exchange transitions only. On

other hand, in a close-coupling theory excitation of 6p5d 1D2 level (in non-relativistic ap-

proximation) can occur as a two- (or more) step processes. Such processes, for example

6s2 1S → 6s5d 1D2 → 6p5d 1D2, can occur via direct scattering, which leads to signiﬁcantly

larger cross sections. The account of relativistic corrections for the 6p5d 3D2 level leads to

signiﬁcant increase of the cross section due to admixture of the singlet 6p5d 1D2 level, see

Eq. (5i).

Total ionization (Q++Q+++. . . = Qi) and single ionization (Q+) cross sections were mea-

sured by Dettmann and Karstensen [17] and total ionization (Qi) by Vainshtein et al. [18].

The CCC results are available only for Q+ (threshold for double ionization is at 15.2 eV).

These results are shown in Fig. 22. It is clear that the CCC method substantially underes-

timates the experimental Q+. At incident electron energies above 15 eV this is related to

the opening of the 5p6 shell. This process is not accounted for in the CCC model (which has

C. Ionization

9

inert inner shells). However, below the inner shells ionization threshold the CCC method

should be able to account for all major ionization channels.

Inclusion in the CCC cal-

culations G-states and other states with larger angular momentum will result in a larger

ionization cross section. The convergence in the TICS, with increasing target-space orbital

angular momentum, is relatively fast [36] and we estimate that CCC results should converge

to values 10%-15% larger than the present results. This correction of the CCC results would

bring them in a very good agreement with measurements of TICS by Vainshtein et al. [18]

in the region of the ﬁrst TICS maximum. The discrepancy between the experimental re-

sults and between the experimental and the theoretical results in this energy range makes

it impossible to for us to present a reliable set of recommended TICS values. More accurate

theoretical calculations or/and new independent measurements are required to draw any def-

inite conclusions. For the time being, we arbitrarily renormalized the results of Dettmann

and Karstensen [17] at the ﬁrst maximum to the value of 13e-16 cm2. These renormalized

values are listed in Table VII.

D. Elastic scattering, momentum transfer and total scattering

Elastic scattering and momentum transfer cross sections are available from a number of

calculations. They are shown in Figs. 23 and 24, respectively. Our recommended values are

given in Table VIII, where we have also included the recommeded total electron scattering

cross sections, see Fig. 25, based mainly on the CCC results. At low energies, the experi-

mental results of Romanyuk et al. [19] are in poor agreement with our results as well as with

the results of all other calculations. Hence we suppose that the present theoretical results

are more accurate than the experimental ones.

We have presented a recommended set of integrated cross sections for electron scattering

by the ground state of barium. For most of the transitions presented here no previous

experimental or theoretical data are available. We expect our results to be useful in practical

applications and will stimulate further experimental and theoretical eﬀort to further improve

the cross section data set.

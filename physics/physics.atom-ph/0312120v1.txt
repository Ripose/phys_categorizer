INTRODUCTION

Narrow optical transitions are considered as basis for frequency standards, thanks to the recent progress made
in atom and ion cooling and trapping, laser stabilization and high-resolution optical spectroscopy. Two kinds of
experiments are under study in various groups: one uses an ensemble of laser-cooled neutral atoms in a fountain, an
optical lattice or a BEC, the other one uses a single trapped laser-cooled ion (for a recent review see [1]). The present
work is motivated by strong progress in storing, observing, cooling and coherently manipulating single ions in Paul
traps. Together with the ultra-precise optical frequency measurements achieved by frequency chains and frequency
combs, these progress lead towards the realization of single-ion frequency standards, as for Hg+[2], Sr+[3, 4], Yb+[4]
and In+[5], and proposed for Ca+ [6]. Our own experimental project aims to build an optical frequency standard
using the electric quadrupole transition 4S1/2
3D5/2 of a single calcium ion at 729 nm. Among the frequency
standard candidates, Ca+ possesses the major advantage that the required radiations for cooling and exciting the
clock transition can be produced by solid state lasers or diode lasers.

→

The performances of a frequency standard are deﬁned by the stability of its local oscillator (a laser in the optical case)
and the precision achieved in the observation of an atomic transition. Frequency instability is due to deviations from
a mean frequency throughout varying probe time intervals, while frequency uncertainty is caused by the frequency
ﬂuctuations caused by environmental conditions and by the experimental conditions for observation. The quality
factor of optical atomic transitions can reach 1015, which is 5 orders of magnitude higher than for microwave frequency
standards and thus better performances than these last standards are hoped.

In the ﬁrst part of this paper we discuss the choice of the interrogation schemes which may inﬂuence on the
frequency stability of a proposed frequency standard via the variation of the duration of the probe cycle. Using
numerical simulations we compare single-pulse spectroscopy with time-domain Ramsey interferometry. In the second
part, systematic eﬀects expected for a standard based on 43Ca+ that may reduce its accuracy and precision are
discussed. In this paper we employ the speciﬁc parameters of the Ca+-ion trap experiment in Marseille [6] as an
example, but we keep the manuscript as general as possible to remain applicable to other atomic species.

FIG. 1: Transitions involved in the cooling and probing of an ion for a frequency standard. In practice, the cooling scheme
may involve several lasers because of a possible hyperﬁne structure and/or a possible decay towards other metastable states.
The light scattered on the cooling transition is also used for detection of the ion. In most cases, Γcool is of the order of 20 MHz
whereas Γm is of the order of 1 Hz.

Frequency stability is one of the major characteristics of a frequency standard. It can be quantiﬁed by the Allan

deviation σy(τ ) measured for an average time τ :

where Q = f0/∆f is the quality factor deﬁned by the ratio of the clock frequency over its observed linewidth, S/N
the signal to noise ratio and Tc the cycle time required for the interrogation of the ion.

The probe schemes for an optical transition in a single ion consist of a preparation stage, an excitation of the clock
transition, and a ﬁnal detection stage. The cycle time Tc is the sum of the corresponding time durations Tprep, Texc,
and Tdet. The preparation stage implies laser cooling of the ion and optical pumping into the internal state chosen to
be the ground state (see ﬁgure 1). The probing of the clock transition by the local oscillator (a laser) is done by direct
laser excitation. During this stage, all the preparation lasers are shut oﬀ. After excitation of the clock transition,
the cooling lasers are switched on again. The quantum jump method proposed by Dehmelt [7] allows to detect if the
atom is excited or not: the absence of ﬂuorescence signal during the detection stage proves that the ion is ”shelved” in
the metastable upper state whereas the presence of ﬂuorescence signal means that the ion is still in the cooling cycle.
Repetition of this measurement as a function of the clock laser frequency allows to measure the transition probability
distribution. In the following, we discuss the conditions for realization and the maximum duration required for these
various stages. The choice of the suited interrogation scheme minimizes the Allan deviation.

A. Preparation and detection

In this paragraph, we describe the cooling process to evaluate its duration. We suppose the ion located at the center
of the trap, where the RF-trapping ﬁeld is minimum and has little inﬂuence on the ion motion. Since the trap creates
a harmonic potential, the motion of the ion is a superposition of oscillations at diﬀerent frequencies due to the spatial
anisotropy of the trapping device. If we suppose, for simplicity’s sake, that there is only one frequency of motion
ωtr/2π in the trap, the resulting atomic emission spectrum is composed of a central frequency corresponding to the
atomic transition ω0/2π and sidebands separated by multiples of the motional frequency (ω0
pωtr)/2π, (p integer).
The sidebands are resolved if the width of each band is smaller than their mutual separation (the strong conﬁnement
condition [8]). This can be potentially achieved in miniature traps with high motional frequencies (
1 MHz) for all
≈
the narrow transitions considered as potential basis for frequency standards (Γm ≪
ωtr, see ﬁgure 1). The intensity
of each band p in the spectrum depends on the oscillation amplitude X of the ion in the trap like J 2
p (kX) [8] where
k is the laser wavevector of the probed transition and Jp the Bessel function of order p. The functions J 2

order of milliseconds while the optical pumping is faster than the millisecond, we can thus estimate Tprep to 5 ms.

The duration required for the detection stage depends on the ﬂuorescence signal collected on the strong dipole
20 MHz, one can expect at least 104 counts per second (cps) over
transition. For such transitions with a width of
a stray light level of less than 100 cps. In these conditions, 10 ms-periods are suﬃcient to acquire enough signal to
decide if the atom has been excited or not into the metastable state. As a consequence, 15 ms is a realistic estimation
for the preparation and detection contributions to the cycle duration. To this minimum cycle duration must be added
the excitation duration time Texc. In the following we theoretically study the minimization of this probe time for
diﬀerent excitation schemes.

B. Choice of the excitation scheme

The width ∆f of the observed transition and its signal to noise ratio depends on the laser excitation scheme.
Nevertheless, the choice of a high-frequency clock transition (in the optical domain) allows to reach smaller Allan
deviations than the ones obtained on actual frequency standards in the microwave domain. Until now, the narrowest
10−15
optical ion linewidth has been observed on Hg+ [9] and has allowed to reach a relative frequency stability of 7
over a 1 s averaging. Here we discuss possible excitation schemes irrespective of the ion implied and we use a reduced
Allan deviation σ′ = σy(τ )
f0√τ to quantify the expected frequency stability of the standard, keeping in mind
that reduced Allan deviations between 1 and 10 have already been measured on lasers locked on an atomic optical
transition.

×

×

Let pm be the probability for the ion to be in the metastable state after excitation by the clock laser. The
experimental signal used to lock a laser on the optical transition is the diﬀerence of the probability pm measured
several times on the low and high frequency sides of the transition. The equality of the two probabilities implies that
the mean frequency is the center of the line. Several sources of noise can limit the signal to noise ratio. Among these
is the quantum projection noise [10] which is dominant once the technical noise has been reduced. The laser excitation
creates a linear superposition of the ground (

is in most cases observed for pm at half maximum on the line proﬁle. Thus, maximum frequency sensitivity and
maximum signal to noise ratio are not compatible. Additionally, the upper state ﬁnite lifetime leads to spontaneous
decay which can reduce the maximum excitation probability for long excitation time.

Two excitation schemes have been experimentally tested by several groups: a single Rabi pulse and two temporally
separated Ramsey pulses. The ﬁrst one has been performed on Hg+ [2], In+ [12], Sr+ and Yb+[4], and the second
one on Hg+ [2] and Sr+ [3]. In the following we enlighten the principal features of each methods and then compare
them. To quantify the relative stability allowed by the discussed methods, we evaluate the reduced Allan deviation

have half of this probability. pm is this probability at half maximum and ∆f is the full width at half maximum. For

To avoid power broadening, the narrow transition can be experimentally observed if the Rabi pulsation Ω is smaller
than the linewidth and the interrogation time longer than the lifetime. But because of the ﬁnite lifetime of the excited
state, the maximum excitation probability is low and requires several seconds to be reached, reducing the relative
stability even if the linewidth is close to the natural width. In an ideal context where the experiment is not limited by
the laser stability, the calculations show that the smallest reduced Allan variance is reached with a single pulse which
should last at least 1 s and drive the transition with Ω of the order of 2
Γm. With today’s laser stability a cycling
time of few secondes for a single measure seems not realistic. We rather consider excitation schemes with durations
inferior to 1 second, since a cycle has to be repeated several times before a signal can be built up to counteract on
the frequency of the local oscillator.

×

In ﬁgure 2, are plotted the excitation probability at half maximum pm , the full width at half maximum ∆f and
the reduced stability as deﬁned by equation (3), versus the cycle time Tc = Texc+15 ms, assuming a single Rabi
pulse. These curves reﬂect Rabi oscillations, which show maximum excitation probability for Texc = (2p + 1)π/Ω.
The interesting feature is the minimum of the reduced Allan variance observable for the shortest Texc. Two cases
with diﬀerent Rabi pulsation Ω (Ω = 10
Γm) are compared in ﬁgure 2. For both cases, excitation
probability and full width at half maximum are computed for an ion whose oscillatory motion (or phonon distribution)
is corresponding to the Doppler cooling limit (
= 0).
h
The ﬁrst result to mention is that the ﬁrst minima of the reduced Allan variance are identical for these two phonon
distributions, for the chosen Rabi pulsation, thus conﬁrming that Doppler cooling is suﬃcient for state preparation.
The results shown on ﬁgure 2 suggest that the discrepancy between the
= 0 phonon distribution
increases with the pulse duration. We have checked that in the case of the short pulses we consider in the following,
the results are nearly the same for these two thermal phonon distributions and thus, from now on, only the cases

more than 300 ms. In the second case, the ﬁrst minima is reached for a cycle duration of 50 ms, but this shortening
of the cycle duration is paid by an increase of σ
equal to 4.5. This trend is general and a further increase of the Rabi
pulsation leads to an increase of the minimum Allan deviation as well as a decrease of the required cycle time.

We now take into account the eﬀect of a ﬁnite laser linewidth on the minimum reduced Allan deviation and compare
the value computed for a laser narrower than the atomic transition (ΓL/2π = 0.1 Hz) to the one computed with an
achievable 10 Hz broad laser. In this later case, the performance of the clock are greatly reduced ﬁrst by the reduction
of the excitation probability and second by the broadening of the observed transition. The ﬁrst drawback can be
overcome by the increase of the Rabi pulsation but this is paid by a further increase of the transition broadening. As
a consequence, for a given laser linewidth and a given metastable lifetime, there is an optimal Rabi pulsation which
is minimal
results in a minimal reduced Allan deviation. This is illustrated on ﬁgure 3 where for ΓL/2π = 10 Hz, σ

2. Comparison with Ramsey interferometry

The introduction of the separated ﬁelds method or Ramsey interferometry [15] was soon followed by breakthroughs
in high resolution spectroscopy and is expected to overcome the limitations met with single pulse excitation. With
this method the line proﬁle is recorded after two pulses of duration T such as ΩT = π/2, separated by a free evolution
time Tf ree. When the laser detuning is scanned, the proﬁle show Ramsey fringes resulting from an interference pattern
and for short enough pulse duration, the width of the central fringe is equal to 1/2Tf ree and is then independent from
the Rabi pulsation. For a chosen pulsation Ω, the evolution of pm, ∆f and σ
does not show oscillations with Tc , like
for a single Rabi pulse. σ
takes very high values for short Tc and decreases toward a limit for longer Tc. This limit
depends on the choice of the pulsation Ω. To compare the Rabi and Ramsey excitation scheme, we looked for the

This study shows that there is little diﬀerences between the performances allowed by these two methods. Nevertheless,
the Ramsey method is more advantageous with laser narrower than 5 Hz whereas for broader laser, the Rabi method
gives slightly better results. These features are summarized on ﬁgure 4 where the minimum reduced Allan deviation
is plotted for a laser linewidth from 0.01 to 100 Hz. Two diﬀerent cases are then studied. On one hand, the minimal
deviation is searched with no limitations on Tc nor Ω. Then, the Ramsey or Rabi method gives nearly the same
results and only one of them is plotted on ﬁgure 4. The minimal achievable reduced deviation is 1.4 for Rabi and 1.3
for Ramsey method, for an ultra-narrow laser. The Ramsey method requires 3.5 s to reach its limit, which is more
than three times longer than the time required by a single Rabi pulse.

On the other hand, the minimal deviation is searched for a cycle time ﬁxed to 50 ms. For a single Rabi pulse,

accuracy if Ω = 104

For ΓL > 5 Hz, better results are reached for a lower pulsation of Ω = 100

excitation allows to reach a reduced deviation of 3.3 and a Rabi excitation a deviation of 5.1, for a laser as narrow as

III. FREQUENCY STANDARD ACCURACY AND PRECISION

The second relevant set of parameters deﬁning a frequency standard are its accuracy and precision. The standard
frequency may be shifted from the atomic value by any interaction of the atom with external ﬁelds. If this shift is
constant, it only reduces the standard accuracy but not its precision. If this shift varies in time or can not be evaluated
precisely, the precision is reduced also. Since all this contributes to the uncertainty of the future frequency standard,
all the interactions of the ion with its surrounding must be controlled to minimise and/or make constant any shift of
the standard frequency. Here we evaluate these shifts for a calcium ion in order to choose the best internal state and
environment for which they are minimum.

3 mHz. We require that during
the excitation of the transition by the clock laser, all other lasers are shut oﬀ. This makes sure that there are no
light-shifts of the levels S1/2 and D5/2 caused by the cooling lasers. The other major eﬀects that can shift the standard
frequency are due to the local magnetic and electric ﬁelds and to the power of the clock laser itself. In the Lamb-Dicke
regime, only the second order Doppler eﬀect shifts and broadens the line. We ﬁrst focus on the Zeeman eﬀect as it
governs the choice of the isotope and atomic sublevels used for the standard.

A. Zeeman eﬀect

To avoid any uncontrolled or non-stable shifts, the frequency standard must be made as independent as possible
of environmental conditions. The ﬁrst order Zeeman eﬀect can be straightly eliminated by the use of atomic Zeeman
sublevels with no projection of the total moment on the magnetic ﬁeld (m = 0). The solution is to use an isotope
with a half integer nuclear spin. The most abundant one (0.135%) is 43Ca+ with a nuclear spin 7/2. The hyperﬁne
structure of this isotope can be found on ﬁgure 5. The second order Zeeman shift depends on the choice of the
hyperﬁne sublevels. We calculate these shifts by searching the eigenvalues of the Zeeman Hamiltonian for the

states. The Zeeman shift of the fundamental hyperﬁne levels
magnitude smaller than the shift of the metastable hyperﬁne levels
and are not relevant
for the choice of the level to use. Figure 6 shows the quadratic Zeeman shifts for the diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels of
D5/2 for sublevels mF = 0. These curves illustrate the great variation of these shifts with the hyperﬁne sublevel.
Depending on the level involved, the second order Zeeman eﬀect can be as large as 98.04 Hz/µT2 for F = 1 or reduced
to -9.05 Hz/µT2 for F = 6 (see ﬁgure 6). This last level should be used as basis for the standard to reduce the second

high level signal by spinning of the laser polarisation [4, 19] and we do not consider this reduction of the signal as
a limitation. Without any magnetic ﬁeld applied, the local ﬁeld caused by the earth and the close surrounding is
of the order of 0.01 T whereas such ﬁelds can be produced by 1 A in Helmholtz coils. Furthermore, magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations of 0.2 µT over one day have been observed in an unshielded environnement [20]. As a consequence, in
a thermalized and shielded environnement, it is technically possible to compensate for the already existing magnetic
ﬁeld and to add the desired magnetic ﬁeld of 0.1
0.05µT with available current supplies of 1 A stabilized to the mA

B. Shifts due to interaction with DC electric ﬁelds

The second order Stark eﬀect shifts the standard frequency through the coupling of the levels S1/2 and D5/2 to
all the other atomic levels by electric dipole interaction with any DC or slowly varying electric ﬁelds. These ﬁelds
also shift the D5/2 level by the coupling of its electric quadrupole moment to any electric ﬁeld gradient. In a usual
miniature spherical trap, the conﬁning electric ﬁeld has no static component, oscillates at a frequency of the order of
10 MHz and its shape in its center can be very well approximated by a quadrupole. In the exact center of the trap
there should be no oscillating ﬁeld but an oscillating ﬁeld gradient. However, in a real Paul trap, patch potentials
deform the harmonic potential well created by the RF ﬁeld. They separate the minimum potentiel point from the
zero RF-ﬁeld point and static bias voltages have to be applied in the three directions to make these two points meet
again and reduce any static ﬁeld smaller than V/cm. This step is required to be able to cool an ion to the Doppler
limit and reach the Lamb-Dicke regime [22] and can lead to an increase of the static electric ﬁeld gradient. Such
gradient can realistically reach 1V/mm on 1 mm (the typical diameter of a Paul-Straubel trap). The local electric
ﬁeld is then the sum of the quadrupole oscillating ﬁeld that traps the ion, the bias static ﬁeld lower than V/cm and
the isotropic ﬁeld radiated by the vessel considered as a blackbody. Since the frequencies of this radiated ﬁeld are far
under the optical resonance of Ca+, the ﬁeld can be taken into account by its mean-square value averaged over all
the blackbody spectrum, whose value is given by [23]

(cid:18)

in (V/m)2 with T in Kelvin. At room temperature, this ﬁeld overtakes the static bias ﬁeld resulting from compensation
of patch potentials. Nevertheless, it can be drastically reduced by cooling of the vessel and a thermalization at 77 K
sets this ﬁeld under the level of V/cm, to be compared to the bias static one.

Thanks to a symmetry property of the second order Stark Hamiltonian (which behaves like a second order tensor),
the Stark shift of S1/2 is independent of the hyperﬁne level and Zeeman sublevel. As a consequence, it is also
independent of the polarisation of the electric ﬁeld and behaves like a scalar (this property is true for any level with
J < 1). An electric ﬁeld couples the ground state 4S1/2 to all the nP1/2 and nP3/2 levels but in the fact, the sum of
the oscillator strength on 4P1/2 and 4P3/2 is already equal to 1 [24] and there is no point taking into account other
couplings to n > 4 levels. The second order Stark shift on 4S1/2 is then easily evaluated to

9.5 mHz/(V/cm)2.

The Stark eﬀect on the D5/2 level can be split into a scalar term, independent on F and mF and a tensorial part,
depending on these two quantum numbers and on the angle θ between the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld deﬁning
the quantiﬁcation axis. The sum of all the oscillator strengths of the transitions between 3D5/2 and nP3/2(n
4),
nF5/2(n
4) is only 0.48 (according to the Harvard database [24]), suggesting that there are other
couplings with levels belonging to the continuum. Then our evaluation can only be a rough estimation, but it gives a
correct order of magnitude. We ﬁnd
1)/2
for the tensorial part and associate an uncertainty as high as the value itself to take into account that there are missing
couplings. The total frequency shift due to DC-Stark eﬀect is then

As for the coupling of the electric quadrupole moment of 3D5/2 to any electric ﬁeld gradient, it depends on the
hyperﬁne level and its Zeeman sublevel and on the shape as well as on the symmetry axis of the electric potential
[25]. The coupling strength is due to a non spherical repartition of the electronic charge density and depends on the
atomic orbitals of the considered level. The quadrupole moment Θ(3D5/2) of the ﬁne structure state can be deﬁned

The hyperﬁne level has little inﬂuence on this shift as, for exemple, 7/11 is replaced by 17/35 for the level F = 2.
With the expected gradient of 1 V/mm over 1 mm, the uncertainty induced by this eﬀect reaches the Hertz level,
which is a lot compared to the width of the clock transition in Ca+. Any modiﬁcation of the patch potential, due for
exemple to the ion creation process, alters this shift and reduces the reproductibility of the standard. Still, this eﬀect
can be eliminated by averaging the transition frequency measured with the magnetic ﬁeld along three perpendicular
directions, as the geometrical Π factor is then averaged to zero [25]. The remaining uncertainty will then depend on
the precision of the angle setting between the three measures. This precision will depend a lot on the vessel design
and experimental setup, thus it seems diﬃcult to estimate such an uncertainty as long as we have not performed such
a measure. Nevertheless, other authors [28] have projected to reduce by 50 the uncertainty induced by this shift and
we assume that a reduction by a factor of 10 is achievable, which set the uncertainty induced by this quadrupole eﬀect
to
0.1 Hz. At this point, it is important to mention that in spherical miniature trap, the ﬁeld gradient is lower than
in a linear trap, due to the conﬁning geometry. As a consequence, a spherical trap must be preferred to a linear trap
to minimize the shift induced by such gradient and thus the frequency uncertainty.

C. Shifts due to interaction with AC electric ﬁelds

During the excitation, only the clock laser is involved. It can still cause an AC-Stark shift (or light-shift) of S1/2
and D5/2 by coupling them to P1/2 and P3/2 by dipole interaction or by coupling them to other Zeeman sublevels of
D5/2 and S1/2 by quadrupole interaction (the coupling with D3/2 is far less strong). The ﬁrst two couplings produce

Light-shifts of a few kHz due to quadrupole interaction with other Zeeman sublevels have been measured on 40Ca+
isotope [29]. In these experiments Rabi pulsations of 1 MHz were used with laser detunings of the order of 1 MHz also.
We calculated this shift in the context of the clock transition excitation for a Rabi pulsation equal to 1000 s−1 and a
magnetic ﬁeld of 0.1 µT. The frequency detuning required to probe the clock transition depends on the laser linewidth
10 Hz for this detunings the light-shift eﬀect
and the Rabi pulsation used, it is of the order of 1 Hz and by chosing
is not underestimated. We ﬁnd for these parameters an eﬀect equal to
0.06 mHz if the
magnetic ﬁeld is 1 µT. The sign depends on the sign of the detuning. Two reasons make this eﬀect very small: the
small Rabi pulsation considered for such experiments and the small detuning required to probe the two sides of the
transition (of the order of few Hz). With such small detuning, the couplings of

E. Uncertainty budget

(18)

Table I gives the uncertainty budget expected for an atomic clock based on 43Ca+. At room temperature, and with
the considered magnetic ﬁeld, the major source of frequency shift and uncertainty is the Stark eﬀect induced by the
radiated electromagnetic ﬁeld. This eﬀect is drastically reduced in a vessel cooled to 77 K and then the major source
of uncertainty becomes the coupling with the ﬁeld gradient through the quadrupole moment of D5/2 which can not
be reduced by cooling the vessel nor by controlling the ion position inside the trap and limits the ultimate precision
of the clock. It can be compensated by measuring the frequency with three perpendicular directions of magnetic
ﬁeld, but the obtained precision will depend on the design of the experimental setup and the ability to control the
directions of the laser propagation and magnetic ﬁeld. The projections made for all these major systematic shifts

All the systematic frequency shifts have been estimated and the environmental conditions studied in order to
minimize the frequency uncertainty. This is limited by the precision reached in the successive orientation of 3 mutually
perpendicular magnetic ﬁelds to compensate the coupling of the D5/2 quadrupole with a ﬁeld gradient. A technical
challenge for the future optical frequency standard will be to point these three perpendicular magnetic ﬁelds and to
reduce the ﬁeld gradient. In this context, a miniature spherical trap is more appropriate than a linear one to a frequency
standard. Our projections show that with a ﬁrst step alignement, a standard based on

It is shown that one can stimulate, by using the present-day laboratory magnetic ﬁelds, transitions
between the lm sub-levels of fast µHe+ ions formating in muon catalyzed fusion. Strong ﬁelds
also cause the self-ionization from highly excited states of such muonic ions. Both eﬀects are the
consequence of the interaction of the bound muon with the oscillating ﬁeld of the Stark term coupling
the center-of-mass and muon motions of the µHe+ ion due to the non-separability of the collective
and internal variables in this system. The performed calculations show a possibility to drive the
population of the lm sub-levels by applying a ﬁeld of a few T esla, which aﬀects the reactivation rate
and is especially important to the Kα x-ray production in muon catalyzed fusion. It is also shown
that the 2s − 2p splitting in µHe+ due to the vacuum polarization slightly decreases the stimulated
transition rates.

Both eﬀects are consequences of the non-separability of the collective and internal degrees of freedom of the charged
two-body system (µHe+) in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld [7]. The coupling between the center-of-mass
(CM) and light particle (muon) motions is described by an oscillating Stark term which is proportional to the mass
ratio mµ/M (mµ and M are the muon and the µHe+ mass respectively), the CM-momentum (see below) and the
magnetic ﬁeld strength B [7]. A rather strong coupling of the CM and muon motions due to the essential non-
1/137) makes the system µHe+, formed

in µCF , suﬃciently sensitive to the external magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, as it will be shown below, one can drive the sub-
level populations Pnlm of the fast µHe+ in excited states n

from the ﬁrst glance the obtained result looks quite unexpected, because the muonic atomic unit of the magnetic

In section II we describe our time-dependent approach for treating the evolution of the two-body charged system in
an external magnetic ﬁeld. The calculations of the transition rates between the sub-levels lm of the fast µHe+ ion in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld are discussed in section III. Section IV is devoted to a discussion of the self-ionization
process of highly excited states of the fast µHe+ ion in a strong ﬁeld. Finally we provide some conclusions in section
V.

II. THEORETICAL APPROACH TO THE FAST MUONIC HELIUM ION IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We start our analysis with the transformed Hamiltonian [7,8] of the moving µHe+ ion in a magnetic ﬁeld. The

Hamiltonian of the system H = H0 + h + ∆U consists of two terms describing the CM motion

between the CM and internal motions. Here (R, P ) and (r, p) are the canonical coordinate-momentum pairs for the
CM and internal motions, M0 is the helium nuclear mass. The magnetic ﬁeld vector is denoted as B and oriented along
ze, Q and e, respectively and γ = (M0 + zmµ)/M .

In references [9,10] it was shown that for the one-electron ion He+ the corrections to the CM motion due to the
coupling term (3) are negligible in not too strong ﬁelds and at low CM velocities. Therefore, the CM can be treated
as a pseudoparticle with mass M and unit charge (Q =

with the frequency ω = QB/M in the xy-plane orthogonal to the vector of the magnetic ﬁeld B. v⊥ is the projection
of the initial CM velocity v(t = 0) = ˙R(t = 0) onto the xy-plane. By using the classical Hamiltonian equations
connecting the CM momentum P and the velocity ˙R of the center of mass of the He+ ion in the ﬁeld B [6,7], one
can transform the mixing term (3) to the form

representing an oscillating Stark ﬁeld (see Eq.(4)). Thus we get the simpliﬁed eﬀective Hamiltonian of the electron
motion H(r, ˙R(t)), with ˙R(t) deﬁned by the Eq.(4). Such an approach has, however,many limitations and in particular
fails to describe correctly a number of interesting phenomena occurring in ion physics. In particular for the muonic
ion µHe+ in a magnetic ﬁeld the coupling (3) between the internal and CM variables is me/mµ ≃
200 times stronger
compared to the electronic counterpart He+, what demands an accurate treatment of the non-separability of the
system.

For analyzing the time-evolution of the fast µHe+ ions in a magnetic ﬁeld we suggest an approach including the
non-adiabatic eﬀects in the problem (all the terms of the order mµ/M and mµ/M0 in Eqs.(1)-(3)). It is a mixed
treatment by a coupled system of equations describing quantum mechanically the muon degrees of freedom and
treating classically the CM motion. It is formulated as the initial-value problem

Such an approach is analogous to the ones given in refs.[11-13] suggested for semiclassically treating the dynamics
of molecular processes [12,13]. It has the property of conserving the total energy of the system µHe+ and includes
the coupling between the CM and internal variables, which is important for the problem of a fast muonic ion in a
1/40) and high CM-velocity
magnetic ﬁeld due to the essential non-adiabaticity of the system (mµ/M, mµ/M0 ∼
(v⊥

6αc).

The time-dependent three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation (6) is integrated by the method developed in Refs.[14-

≃

16] simultaneously with the system of coupled Hamiltonian equations of motion(10).

In principle one can think also of a time-dependent perturbation theoretical approach in order to describe the
sublevel mixing induced by the oscillating motional electric ﬁeld. However, the large center of mass velocity together
with the strong non-adiabaticity in the case of our muonic helium would certainly require a very careful estimate of
the possible range of validity of such an approach. For small center of mass velocities of the “electronic” He+-ion a
perturbation theoretical approach for the classical dynamics of the ion has been developed in Ref. [17].

consequence of the classical Hamiltonian equations of motion of the two-body charged system in a magnetic ﬁeld [5–7]
and shows a permanent exchange of energy between the CM and muonic degrees of freedom.

The above results were obtained in the nonrelativistic limit for which the splitting between diﬀerent lm states is
given exclusively by the interaction of the muonic atom with the magnetic ﬁeld. However due to its compactness

IV. SELF-IONIZATION OF HIGHLY EXCITED FAST MUONIC HELIUM IONS IN STRONG
MAGNETIC FIELDS

In refs. [5,6] the self-ionization process for ions in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld has been predicted
and demonstrated by solving the classical equations of motion for Rydberg states of the one-electron He+ ion. Here
we discuss brieﬂy the possibility to ionize the fast highly-excited µHe+ ion by a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Actually, the

4

muon kinetic energy in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld B can become large enough in order to ionize the system
through the energy transfer from the CM to the internal motion according to Eq.(14). Perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld the muonic motion is ﬁnite because of the conﬁning property of the magnetic ﬁeld. This is a principal diﬀerence
of the self-ionization in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld compared to the classical ionization by an external electric
ﬁeld.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we analyzed the transitions stimulated by external magnetic ﬁelds from excited states of the fast
µHe+ ions. The results have been obtained within an approach developed for treating non-adiabatic two-body
charged system in external magnetic ﬁelds on a mixed quantum-semiclassical level.

It was shown that the present-day laboratory ﬁelds of the order of a few T esla may stimulate strong 2s

2p mixing
as well as l mixing of the sub-levels for n > 2 in the µHe+ ions formating in µCF . The eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld
stimulating the 2s
2p transitions can be analyzed experimentally by measuring the dependence of the intensities of
the Kα-lines from the µHe+ on the ﬁeld strength. It is also interesting to analyze experimentally the inﬂuence of this
eﬀect on another important µCF parameter, the reactivation rate R, due to the possible dependence of the value R
on the 2s

2p mixing in µHe+ [25,26].

Fig. 1: Magnetic ﬁeld stimulating the transitions between the lm sub-levels of excited states n = 3 and 2 in the
fast (µHe+)nlm ion. The calculation of the populations Pnl(t) was performed for the ﬁxed projection v⊥ = 6v0 of the
µHe+ initial CM velocity on the plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld B for B = 4T esla. The initial populations
have been chosen as P3s(t = 0) = 1 and P2s(t = 0) = 1.

Fig. 2: Dependence of the time-evolution of the population P2s(t) on the magnetic ﬁeld strength B (for ﬁxed
v0) and the v⊥ component of the initial CM velocity v of the µHe+ ion (for ﬁxed B = 2T esla). The mean
v0 corresponds to the initial kinetic energy 3.5M eV of the µHe+ ion emitting in dt fusion

Fig. 3: Dependence of the time-evolution of the population P2s(t) with and without the relativistic splitting
∆E2S−2P . Broken curves have been calculated without the VP term (15), the solid lines correspond to calculations
including the VP term in the eﬀective Hamiltonian (7).

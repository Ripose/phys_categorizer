Abstract

We investigate the quantum interference between the resonant process of nuclear excitation by electron

capture (NEEC) followed by the radiative decay of the excited nucleus, and radiative recombination (RR).

In order to derive the interference cross section, a Feshbach projection operator formalism is used. The

electromagnetic ﬁeld is considered by means of multipole ﬁelds. The nucleus is described by a phenomeno-

logical collective model and by making use of experimental data. The Fano proﬁle parameters as well

as the interference cross section for electric and magnetic multipole transitions in various heavy ions are

presented. We discuss the experimental possibility of discerning NEEC from the RR background.

INTRODUCTION

The process of photo-recombination in highly charged heavy ions has been the subject of many

theoretical and experimental studies up to today, concerning both radiative recombination (RR)

and dielectronic recombination (DR) (see, e.g., [1, 2]) and their interference. With the enhanced

experimental possibilities and achieved precision, the subject of electron recombination into highly

charged ions has been expanding to include QED corrections [3]. The effect of interference be-

tween RR with DR has been theoretically studied (see, e.g., Ref. [4]) and experimentally con-

cluded [2, 5, 6].

In Ref. [7] a recombination process that is the nuclear analog of DR has been theoretically pro-

posed. Although not yet experimentally observed, nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC)

has been an interesting subject after experimental observations of atomic physics processes with

regard to the structure of the nucleus have been recently reported, such as bound-state internal

conversion [8] and nuclear excitation by electron transition (NEET) [9]. In the resonant process

of NEEC, a free electron is recombined into a bound state of an ion with the simultaneous exci-

tation of the nucleus. The excited nucleus can then decay radiatively or by internal conversion.

Several theoretical studies have been made concerning NEEC in plasmas [7, 10] or in solid tar-

gets [11, 12, 13]. In [14] we presented relativistically correct theoretical cross sections for NEEC

followed by the radiative decay of the nuclear excited states for highly charged heavy ions.

If the initial and ﬁnal states for NEEC and RR coincide, quantum interference between the

two processes occurs. Such an interference effect is interesting as it involves two very different

pathways: while in RR only the recombining electron is involved, NEEC corresponds to a quan-

tum path in which the nucleus is excited. In Figure 1 the RR and NEEC mechanisms are shown

schematically. Beside NEEC, the strong competing process of RR is always present in an exper-

iment. Therefore, the magnitude of the interference effect may also play an important role for

observing NEEC.

In this paper we theoretically investigate the interference between NEEC and RR, focusing

on collision systems with suitable excitation energies that could be candidates for experimen-

tal observation. We derive the total cross section of the recombination process with the help of a

Feshbach projection operator formalism, which allows the separation of the interference term from

the NEEC and RR cross sections. The radiation ﬁeld is expanded in terms of multipoles in order

to clearly discern the NEEC transition multipolarities. The electric and magnetic electron-nucleus

interactions are considered explicitly, and the nucleus is described with the help of a geometrical

collective model and making use of experimental data. The dynamics of the electron is governed

by the Dirac equation. We express the interference term of the cross section using the dimension-

less Fano proﬁle parameter for electric and magnetic transitions in Sec. II. The numerical results

of the calculation are given in Sec. III, together with an interpretation of the results regarding the

possibility of an experimental observation of NEEC. We conclude with a short summary. In this

work atomic units are used unless otherwise speciﬁed.

II. THEORETICAL FORMALISM FOR INTERFERENCE EFFECTS

In this section we derive the total cross section of the recombination process involving NEEC

followed by the radiative decay of the nucleus and RR by means of a Feshbach projection operator

formalism. We consider that the electron is captured into the bound state of a bare ion or an ion

with a closed-shell conﬁguration. We calculate the interference term between NEEC followed

3

by the radiative decay of the excited nucleus and RR in the total cross section for electric and

magnetic multipole transitions of the nucleus.

A. The interference between RR and NEEC in the total cross section

The initial state

consists of the nucleus in its ground state, the bound electron and the emitted photon. Rather

in this case to consider photons of a given angular momentum and parity. The ﬁnal state can be

written as

with nf , κf , and mf being the principal, Dirac angular momentum, and magnetic quantum num-

bers of the bound one-electron state, respectively. The emitted photon has the wave number k,

the total angular momentum L and its projection M. Furthermore, λ stands for electric (e) or

magnetic (m) waves. The intermediate resonant state formed by the electron capture in the pro-

cess of NEEC consists of the excited nucleus, the bound electron, and the vacuum state of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld,

Following the formalism presented in Ref. [14], we introduce projector operators onto the in-

dividual subspaces, in order to separate these states in the perturbative expansion of the transition

operator. We neglect corrections due to two- or more-photon states [15, 16] and due to the presence

of the negative electronic continuum. The Fock space is then given by the sum of three subspaces:

the subspace of the states that contain the free electron, with its projector operator P , the subspace

of the states characterized by the presence of the excited nucleus, together with the correspond-

ing projector operator Q, and ﬁnally the subspace of the states with a photon, associated to the

projector operator R. We postulate the completeness relation

P + Q + R = 1 ,

where 1 is the unity operator of the total Fock space.

The total Hamiltonian operator for the system consisting of the nucleus (n), the electron (e),

and the radiation ﬁeld (r) can be written as

H = Hn + He + Hr + Hen + Her + Hnr .

The expressions of the ﬁrst three Hamiltonians can be found in [14]. Interactions between the three

subsystems are described by the three remaining Hamiltonians in Eq. (5). We adopt the Coulomb

gauge for the electron-nucleus interaction (en) because it allows the separation of the dominant

Coulomb attraction between the electronic and the nuclear degrees of freedom:

Hen =

.

Here, ρn(~rn) is the nuclear charge density and the integration is performed over the whole nuclear

volume. The static part of the electron-nucleus interaction is contained in Hamiltonian He. The

interaction of the electron with the transverse photon ﬁeld quantized in the volume of a sphere of

radius R is given by

Using the projection operators we can separate the perturbation V in the total Hamiltonian

with

H0 = P HQ + QHP + P HR

−

≡
+ RHP + RHQ + QHR .

(11)

(13)

(14)

(15)

This way of deﬁning H0 has the advantage that the effect of the nuclear potential on bound and

continuum electron states is included in H0 to all orders. The individual terms in the perturba-

tion operator describe transitions between the different subspaces. For example, QHP describes

6

(16)

(17)

(18)

in the lowest order the time-reversed process of internal conversion (IC), namely, NEEC, while

P HR and RHP are the ﬁrst-order operators for photo-ionization and radiative recombination,

respectively.

The transition operator is deﬁned as [19]

where G(z) is the Green operator of the total system given by

T (z) = V + V G(z)V ,

G(z) = (z

H)−1 .

−

Here, z is a complex energy variable. The total cross section for a process can be expressed by

the modulus square of the matrix element of the transition operator, after summing over the ﬁnal

states and averaging over the initial states that are not resolved in the experiment,

with the Ψf and Ψi as ﬁnal and initial eigenstates of H0, respectively [see Eqs. (1) and (2)]. Here,

Fi denotes the ﬂux of the incoming electrons, ρf the density of the ﬁnal photonic states, and Ωp is

the direction of the incoming free electron characterized by the angles θp and ϕp.

We use the Lippmann-Schwinger equation

G(z) = G0(z) + G0(z)V G0(z)

(19)

+ G0(z)V G0(z)V G0(z) + . . .

to write the perturbation series for T (z) in powers of V with the Green function G0(z) of the

unperturbed Hamiltonian H0:

T (z) = V + V G0(z)V + V G0(z)V G0(z)V + . . . .

(20)

Since the initial state of the NEEC process is by deﬁnition an eigenstate of P , and the ﬁnal state is

an eigenstate of R, we only need to consider the projection RT P of the transition operator:

RT (z)P = RV P + RV G0(z)V P

(21)

+ RV G0(z)V G0(z)V P

+ RV G0(z)V G0(z)V G0(z)V P + . . . .

7

The ﬁrst term RV P accounts for the radiative recombination. Taking into account from the inﬁnite

perturbation expansion in Eq. (21) the terms that correspond to NEEC [14] we can write the ﬁnal

expression for the transition amplitude for the recombination process as

The aim of this paper is to calculate the interference term in the total cross section. The calcu-

lation of the NEEC cross section and predicted values for several collisions systems can be found

in [14]. Furthermore, the calculation of the RR total cross section is well understood. An extensive

tabulation of relativistic total cross sections for RR as a function of energy ranging from closely

above the threshold to the relativistic regime of relative electron energies is available in [20].

If we consider the matrix element of the Hamiltonian Her connecting the radiation ﬁeld and the

electrons in the interference term, the initial and the ﬁnal nuclear total angular momenta as well as

their projections have to coincide, as they are not inﬂuenced by RR,

In order to calculate the matrix elements in the Fano proﬁle parameter in Eq. (37), an adequate

nuclear model is needed. Following the outline in [14], we describe the nucleus by means of a

geometrical collective model [22] which assumes that the excitations of the nucleus are vibrations

and rotations of the nuclear surface, which is parameterized as

C. Magnetic transitions

The magnetic transitions in the nucleus can be easily included in the calculation by assuming

that the electron does not penetrate the nucleus, i.e., that the electronic radial coordinate re > rn

is always larger than the nuclear radial coordinate. This approximation is precise enough for the

studied cases [26, 27]. The NEEC matrix element for the magnetic transition, involving only the

The remaining matrix element involved in the expression of the Fano proﬁle parameter Qf is that

of the interaction between the nucleus and the radiation ﬁeld (12). We make use again of the

long-wavelength approximation, so that the spherical Bessel functions are written as in Eq. (44).

We have calculated the Fano proﬁle parameter and the interference cross section term σint as

a function of the incoming electron energy for several collisions systems involving electric E2

15

and magnetic M1 transitions. We consider suitable cases of isotopes which have energetically

low-lying nuclear levels which make the interference between NEEC and RR possible.

Here we sum the radiative transition rates to all possible ﬁnal states (note that in our case there is

only one nuclear ﬁnal state, namely, the ground state). By summing over i we account for internal

conversion to the initial state of the NEEC process and all other possible IC channels, for the case

when the capture occurs into a He-like ion. The IC rate can be related to the NEEC rate through

the principle of detailed balance,

.

The NEEC rates and cross sections are calculated using an improved version of the computer

routines applied in [14]. We consider the capture into the bare ions of 164

70 Yb and
154
64 Gd. For the cases of the U isotopes and for 248
96 Cm, the capture into the K shell is not possible
due to the low energy level of the ﬁrst excited nuclear state. For these three systems, recombination

66 Dy, 170

68 Er, 174

into the L shell of initially He-like ions is the most probable one. We regard the capture of the

electron into a closed shell conﬁguration as a one-electron problem, without the participation of

the K-shell electrons. We also consider the capture of the electron into the He-like ions of 156

64 Gd
66 Dy, in which case the width of the nuclear excited state in Eq. (61) contains partial IC rates

and 162

accounting for the possible IC of the K-shell electrons.

and the ones corresponding to RR [I ±

A numerical evaluation of the radial integrals corresponding to NEEC [RL,κd,κ, see Eq. (42)]
L±1, Eq. (50)] is needed for the calculation of the Fano proﬁle
parameters and for the interference cross sections. We consider Coulomb-Dirac wave functions

for the continuum electron and wave functions calculated with the GRASP92 package [29] by

considering a homogeneously charged nucleus for the bound electron. In the case of recombination

into the He-like ions we assume a total screening of the nuclear charge for the continuum electron,

16

i.e., we use Coulomb-Dirac functions with an effective nuclear charge Zeﬀ = Z

2. For the

−

bound electron wave functions, the electron-electron interaction is accounted for in the Dirac-Fock

approximation. The value of RL,κd,κ is not affected by ﬁnite nuclear size effects on the accuracy

level of our calculations. Nevertheless, the ﬁnite size of the nucleus has a sensitive effect on the

energy levels of the bound electron. The energy of the bound electronic state is calculated with

GRASP92 and includes one-loop one-electron quantum electrodynamic terms, and in the case of

many-electron bound states approximate QED screening corrections. The nuclear radius R0 is

calculated according to the semi-empirical formula [30]

R0 = (1.0793A1/3 + 0.73587) fm ,

where A is the atomic mass number. Values of the Fano proﬁle parameters, as well as the NEEC

rate and natural width of the nuclear excited state are presented in Table I. The values of the

resonance strength of NEEC, given in [14],

Values for this line asymmetry parameter Rint are given in the last column of Tables I and III.

A possibility to cross-check the numerical accuracy of the present calculations is given by the

matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian Her, which enters the expression of the Fano proﬁle

parameter. We can use the matrix element to calculate the total cross section for RR for a given

energy, which can be written in the spherical wave approach as

with respect to our previous results [14]. The electronic radial integrals are calculated numerically

using the same type of wave functions for the bound and continuum electron as for the electric

transitions. The reduced magnetic transition probability B(M1) and the energies of the nuclear

levels are taken from Refs. [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Recombination into the K shell is

possible for all the chosen ions, except for Gd. We also present results for recombination into the

initially He-like ions of the 155

64 Gd and 157

64 Gd isotopes.

In Fig. 2 interference and scaled NEEC cross section terms are plotted as a function of the

continuum electron energy for the M1 transition of 185

70 Yb, respec-
tively. These are the isotopes with the largest values for the resonance strengths for the magnetic

75 Re and E2 transition of 174

and electric multipole transitions, respectively. The NEEC cross section has the shape of a very

narrow Lorentzian, with the width given by the natural width of the excited nuclear state, about

2.4

10−5 eV for the case of 185

70 Yb. The interference term
σint for both electric and magnetic cases is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the

contributions of the multipolarities that enter in the RR cross section σRR. While σRR consists of

an inﬁnite sum of multipolarities, in the interference process only the RR photon with the multipo-

larity of the nuclear transition participates. The main contribution to the RR cross section comes

are considerably smaller. In the case of 174

total RR cross section of 2080 b, while the M1 multipole for 185

70 Yb, the E2 multipole accounts for only 121 b in the
75 Re only contributes 0.5 b to the

total RR cross section of 212 b.

As an electron energy resolution in the order of 10−5 eV and less can not be presently achieved

in an experiment, we convolute the theoretical total cross section with the energy distribution of

the electrons to give an orientation for measurements in near future. The energy distribution of the

incoming electrons is assumed to be described by a Gaussian function with a width parameter s.

explanations.

The RR cross section has a practically constant value on the energy interval of s. In order to

demonstrate the magnitude of the NEEC and interference cross sections σNEEC and σint compared

to that of RR, we present in Fig. 3 the ratio of the convoluted cross sections,

R(E, s) =

75 Re as a function of the continuum electron energy for the three different exper-
imental width parameters s = 0.5 eV, 1 eV and 10 eV. While for a width parameter s = 0.5 eV

the contributions of the NEEC and interference terms can be clearly discerned from the RR back-

ground, for presently more realistic widths in the order of eVs or tens of eV the values of the ratio

R(E, s) are too small to be observed experimentally.

SUMMARY

In this article we investigated the interference between NEEC and RR in an electron recom-

bination process. We derived the interference cross section and expressed it with the help of the

dimensionless Fano proﬁle parameter.

We calculated the interaction matrix elements for both electric and magnetic multipolarities

using relativistic electronic wavefunctions. Nuclear excitations are described using a phenomeno-

22

logical nuclear collective model. The nuclear part of the matrix element is written by the help of

the reduced nuclear transition probability whose value is taken from experimental works. For the

quantization of the radiation ﬁeld we use the multipole expansion.

Numerical values for the Fano proﬁle parameters and interference cross sections were obtained

for various heavy-ion collision systems. The interference term in the total cross section of the

recombination process is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the NEEC cross section.

This is associated with the fact that from the inﬁnite multipole expansion of the RR radiation, only

the multipolarities corresponding to the type of nuclear transition interfere with the radiative decay

photons following NEEC. The interference term has a narrow extent on the electron energy scale,

which is related to the small natural width of the nuclear excited state. In order to simulate data of

a recombination experiment, we convolute the total cross section with a Gaussian electron energy

distribution of realistic width parameters. While for well-deﬁned experimental electron energies

the presence of NEEC could be discerned from the RR background, for larger width parameters

both NEEC and the interference with RR become difﬁcult to be observed experimentally.

If the angular distribution of the emitted photons in the radiative decay of the nucleus following

NEEC is different from the one of the RR photons, this can be used to identify the resonant

process in the RR background. Calculations investigating a possible NEEC signature in the angular

distribution of the emitted electrons are in progress.

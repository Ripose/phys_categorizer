Sum rules for an atomic hyperﬁne
structure in a magnetic ﬁeld

Savely G. Karshenboim

Abstract: Sum rules for the energy levels of a hyperﬁne multiplet in a constant uniform
magnetic ﬁeld is presented. It is found that for any values of the electron angular moment
and the nuclear spin there are certain linear combinations of energy levels which do not
depend on the magnetic ﬁeld and can be used to determine the unperturbated hfs separation
in the presence of perturbing magnetic ﬁeld. It is also demonstrated that there are other linear
combinations which are linear with the external magnetic ﬁeld and hence can be used to
determine bound values of the electron and nuclear magnetic moments. The accuracy of the
approximation within which the result is valid is also discussed.

1. Introduction

An essential part of present-day high-precision frequency measurements is related to experiments
performed in the presence of some residual electric or magnetic ﬁeld. To reduce the uncertainty caused
by the ﬁeld, one tries to perform the measurement on those sublevels which are under control, e.g., for
sublevels slightly affected by the perturbing ﬁeld. Here, we study another possible option to deal with
a residual magnetic ﬁeld. We show that despite the presence of a perturbing magnetic ﬁeld shifting the
energy levels, there are some special combinations of energies which do not depend on the magnetic
ﬁeld at all. In the case of microwave measurements that may be used, e.g., to determine the hyperﬁne
separation in the ground state. There are also some more speciﬁc combinations, and in particular ones
where the dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld is linear.

A constant homogenous magnetic ﬁeld shifts different sublevels of hyperﬁne-structure (hfs) multi-
plets differently. However, as it is well known, a speciﬁc combination of energy of the sublevels of any
nS state in the hydrogen atom at presence of the dc homogenous magnetic ﬁeld

number Fz is a well-deﬁned quantum number in presence of both the external magnetic ﬁeld and the
hyperﬁne interaction of the magnetic moment of the nucleus with the electron angular motion, while
F is not in the case when the Zeeman shifts are comparable with the hyperﬁne separation. Still we
can mark a level with its value of F at zero magnetic ﬁeld. The other quantum numbers (such as the
principal quantum number n and orbital moment l in the case of hydrogen) are not presented, but
indeed it is assumed that all energies are related to the same hfs multiplet.

The property of the levels in the magnetic ﬁeld presented in (1) has been numerously applied, e.g.,

to study the hydrogen [1] and muonium [2] hyperﬁne structure.

Here we discuss different ﬁeld-independent combinations of the energy levels for arbitrary electron
states (arbitrary J) and nuclear magnetic moments (I). We assume for most of our study here that any
effects due to the nuclear quadrupole electric moment can be neglected and consider the magnetic ﬁeld
as a weak one in a sense that the ﬁeld affects the levels inside the hfs multiplets but does not mix
different multiplets.

We also consider in this paper another kind of speciﬁc linear combinations of energy levels, which
depend on a value of the magnetic ﬁeld, but their dependence is linear. A ratio of two linearly-dependent
combinations is indeed ﬁeld-independent. Such linearly-dependent combinations can be used to deter-
mine magnetic moments of the electron shell and the nucleus. These values related to the nucleus and
the electron(s) in the atom are somewhat different from their free values, being affected by binding
effects. Comparing various linear combinations, one can determine a dimensionless ratio of these two
magnetic moments.

Measuring various data in presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, one can in principle determine a value of
the ﬁeld and thus to introduce corrections and arrive at unperturbed energy levels and eventually ﬁnd
magnetic moments. There are two main advantages of the sum rules derived in our paper.

• They are derived here for an arbitrary two-spin system without use of any perturbation techniques

and hence the Zeeman shifts can be of any value compared with the hyperﬁne splitting.

• Because of the linearity of the sum rules the combinations can be easily calculated directly from
experimental data and broadening of lines due to inhomogeneity of the ﬁeld, which happens in
actual experiments, could be cancelled in part.

2. The Breit-Rabi formula

The cancellation of the dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld in (1) has been known as a speciﬁc result

for the nS-state which originates from the Breit-Rabi formula [3, 4]

A slight dependence on principle quantum number n is to appear from perturbation theory due to
relativistic and QED effects. The nuclear magnetic moment

also contains a weak dependence on the atomic state via the small relativistic and QED contributions
to gN . The Breit-Rabi formula is valid for a single electron atom in an S state. Our approach developed
further is valid for an atom with any number of electrons. Referring to ‘electron’ magnetic moment or
‘electron’ quantum numbers we will not distinguish between single-electron values and values for the
electron shell.

Four energy sublevels of an nS state in the hydrogen atom as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld are
depicted in Fig. 1. A similar behavior of six hyperﬁne sublevels of an nS in deuterium is plotted in
Fig. 2. Let us brieﬂy discuss our notation. The energy EH
is not the energy of a state with
a quantum numbers F and Fz because F is not a well-deﬁned quantum number in presence of the
magnetic ﬁeld. We consider the energy of a level as a function of the ﬁeld strength H and mark it with
a value of F at zero ﬁeld when F is well deﬁned. We hope this notation is not confusing.

One can conclude from (2) that there is a speciﬁc combination of few levels for an electronic nS

Recent progress in optical measurements offers an opportunity to determine hfs interval of excited
states studying optical transitions, like, for example, two-photon excitation 1S → 2S in hydrogen and
deuterium (see, e.g., [5]). For such a measurement the observed lines are to be related to transitions
which conserve F and Fz. If the measurement is performed with a residual ﬁeld, the sum rules with
vanishing ﬁeld dependence may be helpful. It is advantageous for practical applications to express the
results in terms of the absolute energy of the levels. On contrary, the energy in (2) is a relative energy
deﬁned in such a way that E

3. Atom in a magnetic ﬁeld: an arbitrary electronic state

The ﬁeld-independent results in (12) and (14) have been obtained from an explicit expression for
the energy levels (2) [3]. Now we are to show that such a kind of expressions can be derived in a more
general case for an arbitrary electronic state and any value of the nuclear spin. The only limitation is a
complete neglection of the quadrupole contribution (if it is present), and thus the separations between
levels at zero magnetic ﬁeld are determined by a single parameter, which is the nuclear magnetic
moment. We consider an atom in a constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld which induces the energy shifts
much smaller than the ﬁne structure, so we can study a reduced Hamiltonian deﬁned as an operator in
a certain spin and angular-momentum space for a particular electron state

We demonstrate now, that even in the case of arbitrary values of the nuclear spin and the electron
angular moment, a derivation similar to that for (12) is still possible. It may be constructed in a similar
way with four (six) energy levels. To show that we remind, that, since Fz is a good quantum number,
it is unnecessary to diagonalize the Hamiltonian Hmagn for all hfs states simultaneously. One can do
that sector by sector, with each sector being related to a particular value of Fz. There is no interference
between sectors different values of Fz.

Let us return to the previously discussed well-known result for an nS state (see (12) and (14)).
Technically, it is has been successfully derived because of two basic properties of Breit-Rabi expression
(2) for energy levels at magnetic ﬁeld.

• There is only a single state with Fz = +(I + 1/2) and its energy has a linear dependence
on magnetic ﬁeld. The same is for the state with Fz = −(I + 1/2). The ﬁeld-dependence of
the energy is presented in (7). Since, no re-diagonalization has been involved the dependence
remains linear.

• There are two states for each other values of Fz and in particular for Fz = +(I − 1/2). To
diagonalize the related Hamiltonian one needs to deal with 2 × 2 matrices only. In a basis of
(F, Fz) states, the diagonal matrix elements are related to the hyperﬁne interaction, while the
off-diagonal elements are results of interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld. The same is true for the
substates with Fz = −(I − 1/2). The result of re-diagonalization is given by (9).

Returning to an arbitrary state, we note that there is a certain similarity. The F value varies between
Fmax = I + J and Fmin = |I − J| with step ∆F = 1. The maximal value of Fz (Fz = +(I + J)) is

2006 NRC Canada

6

unknown Vol. 99, 2006

possible only for F = Fmax. The same is correct for Fz = −(I + J). Since for these values there is a
single hyperﬁne sublevel for each, the energy dependence is trivial (cf. (7))

consideration.

We do not specify also constant C(I, J) in the equation above, which depends on I and J, since

that is not necessary for our further evaluations.

Limiting our consideration by these six states (with Fz = ±Fmax and Fz = ±|Fmax −1|, we easily

derive expressions similar to (12), (13) and (14).

Firstly, we note that

∆E1 · x1 = ∆E2 · x2 .

E = 0 ,

Secondly, we choose such a deﬁnition of the energy for a moment, that satisﬁes the condition

(21)

which is a way to ﬁx an additive constant in deﬁnition of energy. Once we do so, the equations (19)

becomes obvious.

Above we have deﬁned the energy by (21); however, we note that (22) (cf. (14)) allows a redeﬁni-
tion of energy by introducing an additive constant. That reads that we are free to change deﬁnition of
energy with an additive constant if necessary and this constant can depend on any quantum numbers
not involved into hyperﬁne interaction.

4. Sum rules: ﬁeld-independent combinations

Above we have taken advantage of similarity in certain expressions for simple previously known
case and for a general situation. The similarity is related to sectors determined by a value of Fz which
have one or two substates only. That is the case of two maximal possible values of Fz (and the op-
posite values with negative Fz). Any other sector with a lower value of |Fz| involves more than two
states and any explicit expression for energy becomes more complicated. It is even unclear whether
it is possible to obtain such expressions. Below we develop an alternative approach to derive various
ﬁeld-independent values as linear combinations of energies in a constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The
approach does not need any explicit expressions for energy levels at magnetic ﬁeld.

First, we ﬁnd a trace of the magnetic Hamiltonian

where the summation is performed over a complete basis set of sublevels, ζ, of the hfs multiplet. There
are two basis sets useful for calculations: one is related to states with a ﬁxed values of F2 and Fz and
the other is for the states with determined values of Jz and Iz. Since the summation is over a complete
set the result does not depend on the choice between these two sets.

Comparing with consideration for nS states, we note that the ﬁeld-independent combination is not
necessarily a symmetrical sum of the contributions with Fz and −Fz (cf. (12) and (13)). Meantime,
we derived above only symmetric combinations. Asymmetric ﬁeld-independent combinations cannot
be found this way.

Nevertheless, we can study odd sum rules related to the properties of

In such a way we have derived not more than I + J values for integer I + J and I + J + 1/2
values of S2n+1 for semi-integer I + J, which are linear in magnetic ﬁeld. Any ratio of them is indeed
a ﬁeld-independent quantity. That provides us with another set of values, which cannot be affected by
the magnetic ﬁeld. So, we derived not more than I + J − 1 and I + J − 1/2 ﬁeld-independent values
independent from each other.

In our evaluation above we marked the levels with quantum numbers (F , Fz) or (Iz, Jz), which
both are not good at the presence at the same time of two effects such as the hyperﬁne interaction
and interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld. The indeces F , Iz and Jz corresponded not to well-deﬁned
quantum numbers, but were just indexes related to some limits (‘weak’ or ‘strong’ magnetic ﬁeld). In
the case of any formal problem of derivation of our results for S2n and S2n+1 we note that all of them
can be presented as a double sum, when the internal sum is a sum of all states, ζ(Fz), with a ﬁxed
value of Fz

while the external sum is over Fz which is a good quantum number. In such a way we need only
somehow to identify levels and know their eigennumbers for Fz.

Altogether we derived not more than 2(I + J) − 1 ﬁeld-independent values (as S2n or as ratio of
two S2n+1). The sum rules, derived here, (for I ≥ 1 and J ≥ 1) are not covered by the Breit-Rabi
formula. We also suggested an analog of the Breit-Rabi formula for six speciﬁc levels. The derivation
above is valid for any spin hamiltonian when we can neglect interaction between different multiplets.
In conclusion, let us discuss two problems related to possible corrections to the sum rules due to

• effects of the nuclear structure;

• quantum electrodynamics effects and atomic structure.

We note that the nuclear electric quadrupole moment (or higher order electric and magnetic mo-
ments) affects the identities above but still the ﬁeld-dependent combinations exist. Since Fz is a good
quantum number, the sums S2n are ﬁeld-independent and calculating all of them one can ﬁnd contribu-
tion of all moments separately. For instance, the nuclear quadrupole moment contributes to hyperﬁne
structure if I ≥ 1 and J ≥ 1. The magnetic Hamiltonian becomes of the form

where the constant B is directly related to the quadrupole contribution to the hyperﬁne structure. In
such a case, the sums S2n remains ﬁeld-independent, but they are expressed linearly in terms of A
and B (cf. (27)). It is enough to ﬁnd two ﬁeld-independent values, e.g., S2 and S4, to determine two

contributions to the hyperﬁne structure separately: one caused by the dipole magnetic moment and
the other caused by the electric quadrupole moment, i.e., by A and B. We do not present any explicit
relationships but it is clear that they can be presented if it would be really necessary for any partic-
ular applications. The sum rules offer an accurate method to compare the magnetic dipole moment
and electric quadrupole moment in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. It can be also used to compare
magnetic moments of the nucleus and an electron by studying a ratio of linear combinations. If one
measures magnetic ﬁeld, the linear combinations can be helpful as well (cf., e.g., with a high-precision
determination of the muonium magnetic moment in Ref [2]).

There is only a source of corrections to the derived sum rules due to other levels. If the magnetic
shift of levels of ﬁne and gross structure is much smaller than the distance between those levels, we
can separate the levels in theoretical consideration to study their magnetic structure. If the shift is big,
a number of levels are mixed (cf. the Paschen-Back effect) and our evaluation is incorrect. It also leads
to a Hamiltonian non-linear in the magnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, in a low ﬁeld such effects produce certain
corrections to the Hamiltonian (17). Additionally, these effects produce a shift of the center of gravity
of magnetic multiplet. However, as long as these effects are small they can be taken into account
perturbatively as effects in the second order in the magnetic ﬁeld.

All other effects, such as effects of quantum electrodynamics, can only affect the values of the
electron and nuclear magnetic moments which become slightly different from the free values and thus
introduce some corrections to the energy levels in the magnetic ﬁeld. However, the structure of the
Hamiltonian (17) is the same and sum rules for the ﬁeld-independent contributions are not affected.

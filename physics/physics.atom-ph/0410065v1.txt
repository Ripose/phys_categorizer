We consider the ﬁnal stage of double ionization of O2 molecules by short linearly polarized laser
pulses. The saddles of the eﬀective adiabatic potential energy close to which simultaneous escape
of electrons from a molecule takes place are identiﬁed. The analysis of the saddles and numerical
simulations of the ionization indicate that to observe clear signatures of simultaneous electron escape
in double ionization of O2 molecules stronger and much shorter laser pulses than those used in the
recent experiment [E. Eremina, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 173001 (2004)] should be applied.

INTRODUCTION

Experimental studies of a non-sequential double (or
multiple) ionization is possible thanks the use of high
intensity ultrashort-pulse lasers [1, 2]. On the other hand
theoretical description of such multi-electron dynamics is
far from complete and suggests that interactions between
electrons become important in considerations [1, 2, 3, 4].
In this paper we present description of the non-sequential
double ionization of molecules based on a classical model
for electrons in a combined Coulomb and external ﬁeld
following the approach developed in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] for the
multiple ionization of atoms.

Recent experimental investigations aimed on the non-
sequential double ionization of diatomic molecules [10,
11, 12, 13] showed that there are diﬀerences between
molecular species. For instance, in the case of N2 it
seems that electrons escape with similar momenta along
ﬁeld polarization axis more often than in the case of
O2 [13]. Such a correlation in momenta of escaping
electrons is viewed as characteristic feature of the non-
sequential double ionization. In our previous publication
[14] we have analyzed non-sequential double ionization
of molecules and presented numerical results mostly for
double ionization of N2 molecules. Here we complete the
analysis by investigating how the distributions change in
the case of O2 molecules for diﬀerent parameters of the
system.

II. RESULTS

In our considerations we assume the re-scattering sce-
nario [15, 16]. Namely, in the ﬁrst step one electron tun-
nels out through the Stark saddle and then is returned
back to the nucleus. And so at the expense of the energy
brought back by the returning electron a highly excited
state of a molecule is formed. Finally, such a highly ex-
cited compound state decays in several ways through a
single, double or multiple ionization. We start our anal-
ysis after the formation of the excited complex that is to
say we assume that we have an initial state of two highly

excited electrons close to the molecular core in the pres-
ence of linearly polarized laser ﬁeld. For short laser pulses
molecules have not enough time to change their orienta-
tion [13, 17] and thus we presume that the motion of the
molecular core is frozen. Hence, the Hamiltonian reads
(in atomic units, which are used throughout):

The potential consists of the potential energies associ-
ated with interactions of the electrons with the nuclei
(the entire structure of the molecular core is approxi-
mated by two positively charge nuclei), with each other
and with the external ﬁeld. Origin of coordinate system
is placed in the center of mass of the nuclei and without
loss of generality it is assumed that the molecule lies in
the x-z-plane. Then xi, yi and zi indicate position of the
electrons, d, the distance between nuclei, and θ, the angle
between the molecular axis and the z-axis (the polariza-
tion axis), respectively. The electric ﬁeld strength F (t)
has an oscillatory component times the envelope from the
pulse, namely:

2
F (t) = F cos(ωt + φ) sin

(πt/Td),

(3)

with F , ω, φ and Td the peak amplitude, frequency, initial
phase of the ﬁeld and pulse duration, respectively,

Td = n

2π
ω

,

(4)

where n is number of cycles in the pulse.

Within this model the only diﬀerence between diﬀer-
ent diatomic species lies in the distance, d, between the
nuclei. In the present publication we restrict ourselves to
the oxygen molecule, hence d = 2.28 a.u. in the following.
To identify channels for simultaneous electron escape
we use an adiabatic approximation, keeping the ﬁeld
ﬁxed, for the reason that the classical motion of the elec-
trons is fast compared to the ﬁeld oscillations (later, in
the numerical simulations, we use the potential (2) with-
out any adiabatic assumption). The channels for the non-
sequential ionization correspond to saddles of the poten-
tial (2). That is, when electrons pass close to a saddle
they may leave a molecule simultaneously because one of
unstable directions of a saddle allows both electrons to
increase distance from a molecule.

rections reﬂect interactions that will push electrons away
from the non-sequential double ionization path leading
to the single ionization.

The Lyapunov exponents that characterize the diﬀer-
ent directions allow one to obtain the cross section behav-
ior for non-sequential double ionization events. Similarly
to the double ionization without a ﬁeld, analyzed many
years ago by Wannier [18, 19, 20, 21], the competition
between the various unstable directions gives rise to an
algebraic variation of the cross section with energy close
to the threshold, namely,

σ(E) ∝ (E − VS)α,

where VS is the saddle energy and the exponent contains
the Lyapunov exponents,

FIG. 1: Energy of the saddle (top panel) and cross section
exponent (bottom panel) as a function of orientation angle,
θ, for O2 molecule (d = 2.28 a.u.). Broken line corresponds to
the saddle in the yz-plane, whereas solid line corresponds to
the saddle in the xz-plane. The ﬁeld strength is F (t) = 0.075
a.u.

For a general orientation of a molecule with respect to
the ﬁeld polarization axis we have found two saddles for
electron escape. The ﬁrst is situated in a plane deﬁned
by the molecular and ﬁeld axes while the other in the per-
pendicular plane. A few stable and several unstable di-
rections are revealed by the local stability analysis of the
saddles. One unstable direction corresponds to the non-
sequential double ionization, while the other unstable di-

;

λr is the Lyapunov exponent of the unstable direction
corresponding to the non-sequential double ionization
path, and λi are the Lyapunov exponents of all other
unstable directions of the saddle [8, 22].

In Fig. 1 variations of the parameters of the saddles
with the orientation θ for the internuclear distance corre-
sponding to O2 molecule are presented. Fig. 1 shows that
the energies and exponents do not change very much with
the orientation of the molecule (especially in the case of
the saddle located in a plane deﬁned by the ﬁeld and
molecular axes). Thus, we may conclude that from the
point of view of the local analysis of the non-sequential
ionization, decay of the highly excited complex does not
depend strongly on the orientation of the molecule with
respect to the ﬁeld polarization axis.

Thus far we have analyzed the potential within the adi-
abatic approximation. Now we present results of numer-
ical simulations of decay of a highly excited two electron
compound state taking into account full time dependence
of the potential (2). Before the double ionization escape
both electrons pass close to the nuclei where they interact
strongly with each other and with the nuclei. Thus we
may assume that all memory of the previous motion (i.e.
tunneling of the ﬁrst electron, its evolution in the com-
bined Coulomb and laser ﬁelds and the rescattering pro-
cess) is lost. Then it is plausible to assume that the com-
pound state which decays to a doubly charged molecule
can be classically modeled by a statistical distribution for
two electrons close to the nuclei. Detailed discussion on
numerical calculations and initial conditions is presented
in our previous publication [14].

In Fig. 2 distributions of the ﬁnal electron momenta
parallel to the ﬁeld axis for the O2 molecule oriented
along the ﬁeld axis are presented. Diﬀerent initial en-
ergy E and diﬀerent pulse durations are considered. For
very short laser pulses (n = 2 cycles) the distributions
are localized along the diagonals indicating that the elec-
trons escape predominately by passing close to the sad-
dles analyzed previously. For longer pulses and for energy

FIG. 2: Final distribution of the parallel electron momenta for diﬀerent initial energy, E and diﬀerent pulse length (i.e. number
of cycles in the pulse, n) in the double ionization of the O2 molecule. The ﬁeld strength is F = 0.075 a.u., the frequency
ω = 0.057 a.u., the internuclear distance d = 2.28 a.u. and the orientation parallel to the ﬁeld, θ = 0. The plots diﬀer in initial
energy E and the number of ﬁeld cycles n: (a) E = −0.05 a.u., n = 2; (b) E = −0.05 a.u., n = 26; (c) E = −0.9 a.u., n = 2
and (d) E = −0.9 a.u., n = 26.

E = −0.9 a.u. the distribution drastically changes its
character. Namely, the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants of the
panel become strongly populated implying that a number
of sequential decays signiﬁcantly increases. The reason
for this is that, after re-scattering when a highly excited
two electron complex is created, there are two dominant
scenarios within the ﬁrst half cycle of the ﬁeld: a non-
sequential double escape or a single ionization. During
the next cycles, unless the molecule is already doubly
ionized, we are left with a singly ionized molecule which
may survive to the end of the pulse or the second electron
escapes and that corresponds to a sequential double ion-
ization. As the pulse becomes longer, the number of such
outcomes increases, even to the point of overwhelming
the number of direct, non-sequential double ionization
cases. Hence, even though the re-scattering scenario is
involved in the double ionization process, for suﬃciently
long pulses the momentum distributions will not show
signatures of the non-sequential electron escape. For the
initial energy E much higher than the minimal energy

of a saddle (VS ≈ −1.27 a.u.) the probability of non-
sequential ionization is bigger and even if the pulse du-
ration is quite long (e.g. n = 26 in panel (b) of Fig. 2)
the signatures of non-sequential process remain.

Alteration in the orientation of the molecule does not
lead to signiﬁcant changes in the momentum distribu-
tions as one can see by comparing Fig. 3 and Fig. 2. For
the ﬁeld amplitude used in the simulations the saddles for
non-sequential process are far away from the nuclei and
the positions and other parameters of the saddles change
only slightly with the vary of orientation θ — compare
Fig. 1.

Figs. 2-3 should be compared with the corresponding
ﬁgures for nitrogen molecule presented in Ref. [14] —
there we chose energies E = −0.3 a.u. and E = −0.6 a.u.
(also the ﬁeld peak amplitude was slightly smaller, i.e.
F = 0.07 a.u.). Comparing the data we may conclude
that high initial energy leads to much clearer signatures
of simultaneous electron escape (even for long pulses)
Initial energy is determined in the
than low energy.

can be reached by increase of the amplitude with simulta-
neous reduction of the pulse duration — very short laser
pulses and the ﬁeld stronger than that used in Ref. [13]
should allow for clear observation of simultaneous elec-
tron escape in double ionization of O2 molecules.

Our analysis is restricted to the ﬁnal stage of the non-
sequential double ionization of O2 molecules, where we
choose initial conditions microcanonically. Early stages
of the excitation process and the nature of the compound
state (i.e. the symmetry of the valence orbital may af-
fect the excitation process) before the ﬁnal decay towards
double ionization may have inﬂuence on the initial con-
ditions. That, in turn, may modify the ﬁnal parallel mo-
menta distributions. This aspect needs further investiga-
tion.

III. SUMMARY

We have performed a purely classical analysis of the
ﬁnal stage of the non-sequential double ionization of O2
molecules in the strong laser ﬁeld where a molecular core
is approximated by two positively charged nuclei and the
re-scattering scenario is assumed. Our analysis, together
with the previous studies devoted mostly to double ion-
ization of N2 molecules [14], allow us to draw following
conclusions: i) From the point of view of classical anal-
ysis, within the considered model, there is no diﬀerence
between nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the sense that
both of them can show signatures of simultaneous dou-
ble escape.
ii) Orientation of the molecule with respect
to the ﬁeld axis does not inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the ﬁ-
nal momentum distribution for the initial energy range
considered in the model.
iii) Shorter and stronger laser
pulses should enhance signature of simultaneous electron
escape that will be visible in the momentum distribu-
tions as a more pronounced symmetrical escape of the
electrons.

rescattering process, thus to enhance signatures of the
simultaneous escape one should apply stronger external
ﬁeld. Increasing ﬁeld amplitude is, however, dangerous
because for very strong laser pulses sequential ionization
(without rescattering) becomes dominant. Compromise

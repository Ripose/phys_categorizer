This review artile deals with some ase studies of relativisti and orrelation e(cid:27)ets in atomi

systems. After a brief introdution to relativisti many-eletron theory, a number of appliations

ranging from orrelation energy to parity non-onservation in atoms are onsidered. There is a speial

emphasis on relativisti oupled-luster theory as most of the results presented here are based on it.

Key words : Relativisti eletroni struture and oupled-luster theory

1 Introdution

One of the most important milestones in the development of theoretial atomi physis has been the

formulation and appliation of theories that an simultaneously treat relativisti and orrelation e(cid:27)ets

in atoms. Following the early work of Swirles on relativisti Hartree-Fok or Dira-Fok (DF) theory [1℄,

Grant made pioneering ontributions to the numerial and angular momentum aspets of this theory [2℄

whih paved the way for further advanes in the (cid:28)eld. Multi-on(cid:28)guration Dira-Fok (MCDF) [3, 4℄ and

relativisti many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) [5℄ odes were developed in the mid 1970s and

early 1980s alulations based on them soon followed [6, 7, 8, 9℄. During the 1980s and 1990s, these two

theories were applied to a wide range of atoms and ions to study a variety of properties [10, 11, 12, 13℄.

The extension of oupled-luster theory to the relativisti regime during the last deade is indeed a very

signi(cid:28)ant development [14℄. Linear and non-linear versions of this theory have been suessfully used

in performing high preision alulations of a number of di(cid:27)erent atomi properties [15, 16, 17, 18℄.

The present review is by no means omprehensive; it mainly highlights some of the work on relativis-

ti and orrelation e(cid:27)ets in atoms undertaken in our group. Unlike moleules, a number of di(cid:27)erent

relativisti many-body alulations have been arried out on atoms using a variety of methods. Rela-

tivisti many-body alulations on atoms are urrently muh more advaned than those on moleules

[19, 20, 21, 22℄. In addition to the inlusion of the Breit interation, ertain types of QED e(cid:27)ets have

also been inluded in atomi alulations. It will take several years before moleular alulations reah

this level of sophistiation. Relativisti many-body alulations of parity and time reversal violations in

some atoms have been performed to an auray of better than 1%. These alulations in ombination

with aurate experiments are now poised to test the Standard Model (SM) of partile physis. It is not

lear at the present time whether it would be possible to ahieve something omparable from studies on

disrete symmetry violations of moleules.

The organization of the paper is as follows : Setion 2 deals with the Dira-Coulomb approximation

and the setion following it (setion 3), touhes upon the Breit interation and QED e(cid:27)ets. Setion

4 is an overview of relativisti oupled-luster theory whih has been used in the ma jority of the al-

ulations onsidered here. In setion 5, we present the basi ideas underlying two physial e(cid:27)ets that

are relativisti in origin (cid:21) (cid:28)ne-struture splitting and permanent eletri dipole moment of atoms arising

from the eletri dipole moment of an eletron and have given the results of some representative al-

ulations. The enhanement of relativisti e(cid:27)ets in heavy atoms along with the in(cid:29)uene of eletron

orrelation is disussed in setion 6 with referene to orrelation energy, hyper(cid:28)ne interations and parity

non-onservation in atoms. In the last setion we make some onluding remarks.

For an N -eletron atom, the relativisti Hamiltonian is given by

where α and β are given by αi =

I (cid:19); σi are the Pauli matries and I
represents the unit matrix. VN (ri) is the nulear potential at the site of the ith eletron and the last
term is the Coulomb interation between the eletrons. H de(cid:28)ned above is known as Dira-Coulomb

This Hamiltonian an also be written as

The eletron-eletron interation an be approximated by an average potential where eah eletron

moves independently in an average (cid:28)eld aused by the nuleus and the other eletron. This is the

independent partile model whih is the starting point of most atomi physis alulations. This an be

put into a mathematial footing by partitioning the full Hamiltonian in the following way :

H =

It is ustomary to assume U as the Dira-Fok potential [23℄ and

Figure 1: Positive and negative energy states

The solutions of the Dira equation admit both positive and negative energy states [23℄ and this is

shown in (cid:28)gure 1. For a free partile, only ontinuum states exist above mc2

. However,

states above mc2

variational ollapse [26℄. The kineti balane ondition [24, 27, 28℄ gives the relation between the large

3 Beyond the Dira-Coulomb Approximation

The eletron-eletron interation an be treated relativistially, by inluding orretions to the Coulomb

interation. The leading relativisti orretion to the Coulomb interation is the Breit interation [29℄,

where the interation Hamiltonian is given by,

HB =

αj

αi ·
rij

(αi ·

+

rij) (αj ·
r3
ij

rij )

.

Here the matries αi, αj are built from the Dira matries and rij is the inter-eletroni distane. The
magnitude of the Breit interation is smaller than that of the Coulomb interation by a fator α2
α is the (cid:28)ne struture onstant and it an be inluded perturbatively or self onsistently [30℄. In addition

, where

to the Breit interation, inlusion of QED e(cid:27)ets like the self-energy and the vauum polarization [31℄

may be neessary for an aurate quantitative desription of ertain properties where relativisti e(cid:27)ets

are important.

The proess involving the emission and absorption of a virtual photon by the same eletron is known

as self-energy. Aording to Dira's theory, the vauum onsists of a homogeneous sea of negative-energy

eletrons. A bound eletron in the atom an interat with an eletron in the Dira sea, thereby hanging

the harge distribution of the negative energy eletrons ompared to the free-(cid:28)eld ase. This results in

the reation of eletron-positron pairs and hene the vauum behaves as a polarizable medium. This

proess is known as vauum polarization. Figure 2 illustrates the self-energy and the vauum polarization

proesses [32℄.

Only a few alulations of self energy and the vauum polarization (whih together give rise to the

Lamb shift) have been performed on many eletron atoms. As the Coulomb interation due to the

nuleus is muh stronger than the eletron-eletron interations in the inner shells of heavy atoms, it

is reasonable to alulate the Lamb shift for suh systems using the hydrogeni or sreened hydrogeni

approximation [33℄. More sophistiated alulations of QED e(cid:27)ets have been arried out in the past

few years. The details of these alulations an be found in a review artile by Shabaev [34℄.

4 Relativisti Coupled Cluster Theory : An overview

In this setion we will brie(cid:29)y introdue the relativisti oupled luster theory; one of the most pow-

erful and aurate relativisti many-body theories. It is equivalant to all order relativisti many-body

perturbation theory and has the virtue of being size-extensive [35℄. Most of the work desribed in the

subsequent setion are based on this theory.

T = T1 + T2 , and are expressed in seond quantization form

tehniques are used to obtain all the terms whih ontribute to this spei(cid:28) ontribution.

For an atom with one valane eletron we (cid:28)rst ompute the orrelations for the losed shell system,

5 Purely relativisti e(cid:27)ets

5.1 Fine-Struture splitting

The (cid:28)ne-struture splitting is relativisti in origin, but is in(cid:29)uened by eletron orrelation. It ours

between the states having same values of the total orbital quantum number L, total spin quantum
number S and di(cid:27)erent total angular momentum J . There have been many attempts to alulate this

quantity for a variety of atoms in their ground and exited states [38℄. We present here the interesting

ase of the ground state (cid:28)ne struture splitting of boron whih has been alulated by di(cid:27)erent relativisti

approahes [39, 40, 41℄. Boron is an open-shell atom with the on(cid:28)guration 1s22s22p1

. The relativisti

on(cid:28)guration interation method (CI) was used by Das et al [41℄. The single partile orbitals used in

the alulations there were obtained by the appliation of the variational priniple. Consider an energy

funtional given by

where H is the Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian, |

yields a set of di(cid:27)erential equations whih were solved self-onsistently by using an appropriate numerial

method [42℄.

and

In this alulation, all relativisti on(cid:28)gurations arising from 1s22s22p1

, 1s22s22p2

were onsidered. The Breit interation and QED e(cid:27)ets (self-energy and vauum polarization in

1s22p3

the hydrogeni approximation) were treated as (cid:28)rst order perturbations. We give below the results of the

alulation. The eletron orrelation ontributions (di(cid:27)erene of Dira-Coulomb+Breit and Dira-Fok)

vary from −

1078.8 to −

5287.4 for Z = 20 to Z = 30.

It is the evident from table.1 that the Breit

interation and the QED e(cid:27)ets play an important role and their inlusion is ritial in obtaining good

agreement with experiments.

5.2 Eletri Dipole Moment of the eletron

The presene of a non-zero eletri dipole moment (EDM) on a non-degenerate physial system would

be a diret evidene of Parity (

ˆP ) and Time-reversal (

ˆT ) symmetry violations. An atom an have a non-

zero EDM due to a non-zero EDM of it's onstituent eletron, under ertain onditions. Aording to a

theorem by Shi(cid:27), in 1963 [43℄, the EDM of an atom vanishes even if it's onstituents have non-vanishing

EDMs. This theorem was based on the following assumptions :

1. the onstituents of the atoms are non-relativisti partiles,

2. the interations between the partiles in an atom are eletrostati,

3. the EDM distribution of eah atomi onstituent oinides with its harge distribution.

By onsidering the relativisti e(cid:27)ets in atoms, Sandars showed that an atom an have a non-zero EDM

[44℄. If an eletron has a non-zero EDM de , the relativisti interation of de with the internal eletri

(cid:28)eld of the atom, is given by,

where Eint

is the eletri (cid:28)led inside the atom; ~σi are Pauli matries and β is Dira matrix de(cid:28)ned in

setion 2. This redues to,

in the non-relativisti limit. It is possible to express the relativisti form of HI in terms of an e(cid:27)etive

6.2 Hyper(cid:28)ne interation

A nuleus may possess eletromagneti multipole moments, whih an interat with the eletromagneti

(cid:28)eld produed by the eletrons at the site of the nuleus . The interation between various moments

of the nuleus and the eletrons of an atom are olletively known as hyper(cid:28)ne interations [37℄. This

interation produe shifts of the eletroni energy levels whih are usually muh smaller than those

orresponding to the (cid:28)ne struture splittings.

The non-vanishing moments are the magneti multipole moments for odd k and eletri multipole
moments for even k . The most important of these moments is the magneti dipole moment (k = 1)

whih is assoiated with the nulear spin. The interation of this partiular moment with the eletron is

known as magneti dipole hyper(cid:28)ne interation.

In general the hyper(cid:28)ne interation is given by [53℄

Hhf s =

M (k)

T (k),

·

Xk

where M (k)

and T (k)

are spherial tensors of rank k , whih orresponds to nulear and eletroni parts

of the interation respetively.

analytial [55℄. The analytial orbitals have the form of Eq. (44). In table 5 the values of the magneti

(PC) and ore polarization (PC) e(cid:27)ets.

It an be seen from this table (table 6) that for M g+

the CP ontribution is larger than the PC in

magnitude for both the states. It is important to note that the former ontribution inludes the hyper(cid:28)ne

latter (see Fig. 4). However, the hyper(cid:28)ne onstant A for Ba+
Even though Ba+

has more ore eletrons than M g+

exhibits exatly the opposite behaviour.

, the relativisti enhanement of the valene (6s)

magneti dipole hyper(cid:28)ne interation results in the value of PC exeeding that of CP.

In table 7 we present the values of A for 6p 2P1/2 and 6p 2P3/2 states of P b+

. The Dira-Fok values

for these two states deviate from their experimental values in opposite diretion, suggesting that the signs

of the orrelation ontributions are opposite for the two ases. This is evident from the result of our

seond order relativisti many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT(2)) alulation. Eletron orrelation

is dramati in the ase of the 6p 2P3/2 state beause of the large and negative ore polarization (-840.6
MHz). However, the value of A at this level di(cid:27)ers from experiment by 48%. After arrying out a

RCCSD(T) alulation this disrepany redues to less than 7% . The agreement of the ground state

value of A with experiment is about 0.7%. These alulations highlight the power of the relativisti

oupled-luster theory to aount for the interplay of relativisti and orrelation e(cid:27)ets in systems with

strongly interating on(cid:28)gurations [62℄.

Hene it learly implies that parity non-onservation (parity violation) means that its Hamiltonian does

not ommute with the parity operator

ˆP .

Parity non-onservation (PNC) was disovered in the beta deay of

60Co by Wu and o-workers in

1957 following the predition by Lee and Yang a year earlier [63℄. This lak of mirror symmetry has now

been observed in several systems and even in atoms whih is an important phenomenon to study. The

latest measurement of parity non-onservation in esium with unpreedented auray (0.35%) has led

to the disovery of the nulear anapole moment [64℄.

The dominant ontribution to PNC in atoms omes from the neutral weak urrent (NWC) interation

between the eletron and the nuleus [65℄. The e(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian desribing the interation onsists

of two parts, one of whih is nulear spin independent (NSI) [65℄ and the other is nulear spin dependent

(NSD) [66, 67℄. In this review artile we will onentrate on NSI parity non-onservation in atoms. The

NSI e(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian is expressed as

Here Z and N are the number of protons and neutrons respetively and C1p and C1n are the vetor
(nuleon) - axial vetor (eletron) oupling oe(cid:30)ients whereas GF is the Fermi oupling onstant and
ρ(re) is the normalized nuleon number density. The matrix element of HP N C sales as Z 3

and it has

been treated as a perturbation. It is primarily beause of this reason that the heavy atoms are onsidered

to be the best andidates for PNC experiments. The total Hamiltonian is now represented by

alulation of E1P N C must be based on a suitable and aurate relativisti many-body theory.

In a

reent review, Ginges and Flambaum [69℄ have presented the urrent status of atomi PNC alulations

and experiments. A number of many-body theories have been applied to alulate E1P N C matrix ele-
ments. The results of these alulations in ombination with the most aurate PNC experiment on Cs

is in agreement with the Standard Model (SM) of partile physis [69℄.

We have formulated a new approah to PNC in atoms based on relativisti CC theory in an attempt to

go beyond the existing alulations. In this formulation the exitation operators (both T and S ) ontain
an unperturbed (supersript 0) and a perturbed part (supersript 1). For a single valene systems like

esium the wavefuntion an be written as

It is lear that onsiderable progress has been made during the past three deades on the relativisti

many-body theory of atoms. However there are some open problems in this (cid:28)eld. Perhaps the two areas

that deserve most attention is the future are :

rare-earths. Work in this area is in its infany [72℄.

(i) Relativisti multi-referene theories to treat a wide variety of open shell heavy atoms inluding

(ii) Inorporation of QED e(cid:27)ets in a systemati way in the framework of relativisti many-body

theory.

in the oming deade.

One an indeed look forward to exiting new developments in relativisti eletroni struture of atoms

Aknowledgements : Some of the omputations presented in this review were performed

on CDAC's Tera(cid:29)op Superomputer Param Padma in Bangalore and in our group's Xeon

PC luster whih was proured from the BRNS pro jet # 2002/37/12/BRNS. Previous

members of our group, in partiular, Dr. Angom Dilip Singh, Dr. Holger Merlitz, Dr.

Uttam Sinha Mahapatra, Dr. Geetha Gopakumar and Dr. Sonjoy Ma jumder have made

important ontributions to our e(cid:27)ort on relativisti many-body theory of atoms.

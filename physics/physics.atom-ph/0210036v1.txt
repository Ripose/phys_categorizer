We report on the experimental realization of an atom optical device, that allows scanning of an
atomic beam. We used a time-modulated evanescent wave ﬁeld above a glass surface to diﬀract
a continuous beam of metastable Neon atoms at grazing incidence. The diﬀraction angles and
eﬃciencies were controlled by the frequency and form of modulation, respectively. With an optimized
shape, obtained from a numerical simulation, we were able to transfer more than 50% of the atoms
into the ﬁrst order beam, which we were able to move over a range of 8 mrad.

Advances in optical manipulation of neutral atoms
have brought new developments in atom lithography, the
process of creating an arbitrary pattern on a solid sur-
face. Nanometer scale patterns were produced using a
standing wave of light placed in the proximity of the sur-
face [1, 2, 3]. More recently, an arbitrary pattern was
drawn from distance holographically[4], using quantum
reﬂection from a surface microstructure. Previously, the
creation of arbitrary patterns was achieved with thin-ﬁlm
transparent holograms [5, 6, 7, 8].

A diﬀerent approach to creating arbitrary patterns is
to scan an atomic beam combined with an atomic fo-
cusing lens, which can be realized using electro-static
[9], magnetic [10] or microwave ﬁelds [11], or a thin-ﬁlm
Fresnel-zone plate [12]. The intensity pattern can then be
written on a surface in analogy to electron beam lithog-
raphy.

We report in this letter on the experimental realization
of an atomic wave scanner, that makes it possible to con-
trol the position of an atomic beam by an electronic sig-
nal. We diﬀracted a metastable atomic beam at grazing
incidence from a glass surface by using a time-modulated
evanescent wave. Our technique was the spatial version
of the work by Steane et al. [13], Szriftgiser et al. [14], in
which they generated frequency sidebands of n × hf with
a sinusoidally modulated evanescent light of frequency f
in a perpendicular reﬂected atomic beam. Diﬀraction of
matter waves from vibrating mirrors has also been per-
formed with neutrons [15].

Diﬀraction of an atomic beam has been proposed
and demonstrated by using a free standing optical wave
[16, 17], a standing evanescent wave [18, 19, 20] and an
evanescent wave on a periodically structured glass surface
[21]. To change the angle of the diﬀracted atoms in this
scheme, one has to rotate mechanically the prism or mir-
ror. It is also often diﬃcult to obtain a single diﬀracted

angle is varied electronically by changing the modula-
tion frequency. Furthermore, the diﬀracted atoms can
be concentrated into a single order by properly tailoring

the modulation waveform.

Due to the averaging of the periodic light potential
modulation along the trajectory of the atom, it is diﬃcult
to obtain eﬃcient diﬀraction into nonzero orders, if the
atom does not pass through the interaction region within
a period of modulation 1/f . Since the thickness of the
evanescent ﬁeld is in the order of the optical wavelength,
this condition can be easily satisﬁed, and we obtained the
diﬀraction into a single order with an eﬃciency of more
than 50%.

Modulation of the potentials in time leads to the ab-
sorption of energy quanta, which in analogy has been
called “diﬀraction in time”. In our conﬁguration, the ab-
sorbtion of energy quanta perpendicular to the surface
leads to a splitting of the atomic beam into diﬀraction
orders, that are separated in space. Since there is no gra-
dient parallel to the mirror plane, the momentum parallel
to the surface does not change. The diﬀraction angles are
then readily calculated:

Θo,n =

n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .

Here Θi and Θo,n denote the angles of incidence and
diﬀraction of order n, respectively, f is the modulation
frequency, v the incident velocity and m the atomic mass.
Figure 1 shows our experimental setup. Metastable
Neon atoms in the 1s5[3P2] state were ﬁrst trapped and
cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) [22] using a four-
beam conﬁguration [23]. By focusing a 598 nm laser into
the cloud of trapped atoms we optically pumped about
half of the atoms to the 1s3[1P0] state, which caused them
to start a free fall pulled by gravity. The other half de-
cayed to the ground state by emitting a 74 nm ultraviolet
photon. An additional laser, red detuned in respect to
the transition at 626 nm, was overlapped with the 598 nm
laser and focused into the trap. The 626 nm laser formed
an attractive dipole potential around the trap, which in-
creased the ﬂux and reduced the momentum spread of
the atomic beam. The setup of the source and MOT was

similar to that described in [6, 8, 24]. All lasers were
continuous wave, single frequency dye lasers.

The atoms illuminated a mask with ﬁve pinholes of
0.1 mm diameter. The atoms passing through the cen-
tral hole, which was aligned exactly below the trap, were
reﬂected by the evanescent wave mirror, placed 6 cm be-
low the mask. The angle of incidence was around 21
mrad. Atoms that passed through the four oﬀ-axis pin-
holes were used for the calibration of the beam intensity.
The atom mirror was realized by total internal reﬂec-
tion of an intense, blue detuned laser beam in a BK7 glass
prism. We used the optical dipole potential originating
from the transition at 626 nm and worked with a detun-
ing of about +2 GHz. The laser beam passed through
an acousto-optical modulator (AOM), and by modulat-
ing the rf-intensity of the AOM driver, we created the
desired light intensity modulations. The average laser
power was between 100 and 150 mW. The beam had an
elliptical Gaussian shape with 1/e2 diameters of 7 × 0.8
mm at the prism. The beam diameters were choosen to
be slightly larger than the size of the pinhole in order to
be able to neglect the inﬂuence of the beam shape in our
optimization procedure.

The prism was placed 45 cm from the trap center cor-
responding to an atomic velocity of 3 ms−1. The velocity
dispersion, which we were able to estimate from the num-
ber of atoms transmitted through the oﬀ-axis pinholes,
was compressed due to the acceleration in the gravita-
tional ﬁeld and amounted to about 1% of the vertical
velocity. The width of the atomic beam is determined by
the size of the pinholes.

The atoms were detected by a micro-channel-plate
detector (MCP) placed 63 cm from the trap. The
MCP ﬂuorescence plate was imaged onto a CCD cam-
era, equipped with an image intensiﬁer. The signal was
registered on commercial video tape which was run later

to retrieve the data with a computer. This setup allowed
us to determine the position of each single atom incident
on the detector.

Since the ultraviolet photons emitted from the trap
were also detected by the MCP, we periodically switched
the electric discharge of the Neon source, MOT trapping
beams and the 598 nm releasing laser on and oﬀ. The
period of this switching was 0.8 s, corresponding to about
twice the time of free fall between trap and MCP. We
recorded only atoms that arrived at the MCP when the
MOT was oﬀ. In average about 20 atoms were detected
by the MCP per second.

Typical outputs from the MCP plate are shown in Fig.
2 (a) and (b). The spot size of the diﬀracted beams were
approximately the same as that of the incident beam,
showing that beam divergence was not increased during
diﬀraction.

In order to calculate the diﬀraction pattern we solved
the one-dimensional, time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, describing the reﬂection of a Gaussian wave packet,
incident with velocity v⊥ = v θi,
from the time-
modulated potential.
It is not necessary to solve the
two-dimensional equation, since the relative intensity of
the diﬀraction orders is insensitive to the propagation
parallel to the mirror surface.

The equation was solved numerically using the algo-
rithm described in [25], chapter 19.2. In this calculation
we also included the van der Waals surface potential, tak-
ing the result from [24]:

with C4 = 7.3 × 10−56 Jm4 and λ = 5.0 µm. We set the
potential to zero in the region where it would be nega-
tive, in order to avoid the singularity at z=0. The van

der Waals potential reduces the height of the evanescent-
wave potential barrier by approximately a factor of two,
and modiﬁes the shape of modulation. Also, if the min-
imum of V (t, z) is lower than the incident energy, some
fraction of the atoms passes the potential barrier and is
lost.

We optimized the shape of modulation in order to
transfer a maximum amount of atoms into one of the
ﬁrst order beams. The arbitrary shape of modulation
of the optical light potential was described by a Fourier
series

and eight harmonics were included in the simulation
(N=8). The optimum amplitudes cn, phases φn and mod-
ulation depth ǫ were then determined by ﬁtting the cal-
culated diﬀraction eﬃciencies to the choosen ideal distri-
bution: |a1|2 = 1 or |a−1|2 = 1 and all other |ak|2 zero,
where |ak|2 is the relative intensity of the kth diﬀrac-
tion order. The procedure was repeated for each modu-
lation frequency f, and the optimum values also depended
on other experimental parameters, such as the potential
height or the angle of incidence of the laser beam on the
prism. The result of these calculations is shown in Fig. 3
(b) for a frequency range between -50 and +50 kHz. The
negative frequency axis corresponds to the −1st and the
positive axis to the +1st order. Full modulation (ǫ = 1)
was found to be always optimum for our parameter range.

Our results are summarized in Fig. 4. Figure (a) shows
the measured and calculated reﬂectivities, i.e. the num-
ber of all coherently diﬀracted atoms divided by the num-
ber of all atoms incident on the mirror, as a function
of the modulation frequency. The reﬂectivity was ob-
tained by counting the atoms in the diﬀracted peaks, and
the atoms transmitted through the central pinhole when
the mirror was removed. We used the number of atoms
falling through the four oﬀ-axis pinholes to scale the in-
tensity. The reﬂectivity, was near 100% on the positive
frequency axis, but decreased slightly on the negative fre-
quency axis with higher frequencies. This is because the
fraction of time in which the height of the potential was
lower than the incident energy of the atoms, was increas-
ing along with the frequency.

Figure 4 (b) shows the measured and calculated rela-
tive diﬀraction eﬃciencies and ﬁgure (c) the diﬀraction
angles for the optimized shapes. The values obtained
with a saw-tooth shaped modulation (modulation depth
ǫ = 0.5) are plotted for comparison. The relative diﬀrac-
tion eﬃciency, i.e. the intensity of the ﬁrst order peak
divided by the total intensity of all peaks, was deter-
mined in the following way: We ﬁrst summed all points
perpendicular to the plane of reﬂection. The distribu-
tion of atom counts was then ﬁtted by a sum of Gaus-
sians, which allowed us to determine intensity and po-

sition of each peak. For modulation frequencies smaller
than approximately 20 kHz, however, the peaks of dif-
ferent diﬀraction orders overlapped, and their intensities
could not be accurately determined.

The agreement of experimental data with calculated
values is reasonable, although the measured eﬃciencies
were slightly less than expected for the optimized shapes.
This discrepancy may be due to small diﬀerences between
the actual experimental parameters and the values as-
sumed in the calculation of the curves, or to the spatial
variation of the evanescent wave light.

Nevertheless, we were able to scan the atomic beam,
that contained more than 50% of the incident atoms, in
a range of about 8 mrad. Less than 10% of the incident
atoms were left in the 0th order beam over the whole
range.

The frequency range, and hence the scanning range,
could be further extended by reducing the interaction
time of the atoms with the mirror. This could be achieved
by using a prism with higher refractive index, larger angle
of incidence of the laser beam on the prism or higher
incident velocity of the atoms.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the manipulation
of an atomic beam with a time-modulated evanescent

4

wave mirror. With an optimized shape of modulation,
which can be determined from a numerical solution of
the time-dependent, one-dimensional Schroedinger equa-
tion, the majority of atoms can be transfered into only
one diﬀraction order. Extended to two dimensions and
combined with a focusing device, the present technique
might be applied in atom lithography to write a pattern
onto a surface, as well as to realize a scanning micro-
scope of neutral atoms to investigate surface characteris-
tics. Focusing of the atomic beam should be possible by
using a curved mirror. The same method could also be
used to realize a 50/50 beam splitter or to couple atoms
into an atomic cavity [26].

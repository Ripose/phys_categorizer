We have generated Coulomb crystals of ultracold 4He+ ions in a linear radiofrequency trap, by
sympathetic cooling via laser–cooled 9Be+. Stable crystals containing up to 150 localized He+ ions
at ∼20 mK were obtained. Ensembles or single ultracold He+ ions open up interesting perspectives
for performing precision tests of QED and measurements of nuclear radii. The present work also
indicates the feasibility of cooling and crystallizing highly charged atomic ions using 9Be+ as coolant.

The two-body Coulomb system is one of the most fun-
damental in physics, and has been central in the devel-
opment of quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum me-
chanics, and QED. In nuclear physics, the study of these
systems can provide an alternative method for precise
determination of nuclear sizes [1]. Hydrogen–like sys-
tems studied include the hydrogen atom and its isotopes,
muonic hydrogen, the helium ions, muonium and positro-
nium. More recently, heavy (high–Z) hydrogen-like ions
have become available [2] and are being used e.g.
for
exploring strong–ﬁeld QED [3], and for measuring the
electron mass [4]. Among the low–Z atomic systems,
hydrogen has been the most extensively studied, in par-
ticular by laser spectroscopy. This has resulted, among
others, in the most precise measurement of a fundamen-
tal constant, the Rydberg constant [5]. While the he-
lium ions 3He+ and 4He+ are important systems because
they are complementary to the hydrogen atom, they have
been much less studied. Precision measurements of tran-
sition frequencies in He+ ions could provide (i) an inde-
pendent (metrologically signiﬁcant) determination of the
Rydberg constant, (ii) an independent determination of
the nuclear charge radii and the isotope shift, assuming
QED (Lamb shift) calculations are correct, or (iii) a test
of QED, using independent radius data (from scattering
measurements) as input.
Precise values of the He nuclear radii can test theoreti-
cal nuclear methods and force models, which accurately
describe these special nuclei (3He is the only stable three-
particle nucleus, 4He is lightest closed-shell nucleus). The
possibility of QED tests with He ions is attractive because
the QED corrections scale with high powers of Z (some of
the theoretically unknown contributions scale as Z 6), and
thus their relative contribution to transition frequencies
is larger than in hydrogen. Also, the available indepen-
dent 4He+ radius measurements agree, in contrast to the
situation in hydrogen.
On the experimental side, the hyperﬁne structure of
3He+ has been measured both in the electronic 1 S
ground state and the 2 S excited state [6]. The Lamb
shift of the 2 S state in 4He+ has been determined from
the spontaneous emission anisotropy with 170 kHz un-
certainty and compared to theoretical calculations [7, 8].
The 3He/4He squared nuclear radius diﬀerence has been
determined at the 0.4% level from the isotope shift in

neutral Helium using laser spectroscopy [9].
A signiﬁcant extension of these studies would be accessi-
ble via high–resolution laser spectroscopy of helium ions,
which has not been performed so far. Measurements of
the 1 S - 2 S and 2 S - 3 S two-photon transition frequen-
cies (at 61 nm and 328 nm, with linewidths 167 Hz and
16 MHz, respectively) have been proposed [10, 11]. For
example, a 1 S - 2 S measurement with reasonable exper-
imental uncertainty < 30 kHz would test the nuclear and
the recently improved theoretical QED contributions at
their current accuracy level [12]. A measurement of the
isotope shift with a similar accuracy would improve the
value of the squared nuclear charge radius diﬀerence by
an order of magnitude.
One important aspect in these future precision experi-
ments will be the availability of trapped ultracold helium
ions, in order to minimize or eliminate the inﬂuence of
Doppler broadening or shifts, and to allow a precise study
of systematic eﬀects. The experience with trapped ions
for atomic clocks has shown the success of this approach
[13].
In this work we report on the ﬁrst production of an ul-
tracold sample of 4He+. While trapping of these ions
is straightforward using a Paul–type trap [14], cooling
is more diﬃcult. Direct laser cooling appears imprac-
tical at present, since the generation of the required
continuous–wave deep–UV 30 nm radiation is a challeng-
ing problem in itself. An alternative and ﬂexible method
is sympathetic (interaction) cooling, where ”sample” par-
ticles of one species are cooled by an ensemble of di-
rectly cooled (often by laser cooling) particles of another
species via their mutual interaction. This method was
ﬁrst demonstrated for ions in Penning traps [15, 16], and
later in Paul traps [17, 18, 19]. Under strong cooling,
the mixed–species ensemble forms a Coulomb crystal.
In sympathetic crystallization of large ensembles a min-
imum mass ratio range msc/mlc of 0.6 between sympa-
thetically cooled and laser–cooled ions has so far been
achieved [20]. Recent molecular dynamics simulations
showed that sympathetic cooling in an ion trap down to
a mass ratio of 0.3 should be possible [21, 22]. A two-ion
sympathetically cooled crystal exhibited a mass ratio of
0.38 [23]. In the present work we have used the lightest
atomic ion suitable for practical laser cooling, 9Be+, for
which the mass ratio to 4He+ is 0.44.

We use a linear quadrupole trap to simultaneously store
Be+ and He+ ions. The trap is enclosed in a ultra-high
10−10 mbar and consists
vacuum chamber kept below 1
of four cylindrical electrodes, each sectioned longitudi-
nally into three parts. The overall length of the electrodes
is 10 cm, the central region being 1.6 cm long. A neces-
sary condition for stable trapping of noninteracting ions
is a Mathieu stability parameter, q = 2QVRF /mΩ2r2
0,
< 0.9. Here, Q and m are the charge and the mass
of the trapped ions, VRF and Ω are the amplitude and
the frequency of the rf driving ﬁeld and r0 = 4.3 mm is
the distance from the trap centerline to the electrodes.
Trap operation at small q parameters is favorable since
rf–heating eﬀects are less pronounced. We operate our
14.2 MHz and an rf
trap at an rf frequency of Ω = 2π
·
amplitude of 380 V where the stability parameter is q
≃
0.04 (0.1) for Be+ (He+) ions. For such small q one can
approximate the motion of ions (in absence of interac-
tions) by that in an eﬀective time-independent harmonic
potential

For laser cooling of Be+ ions we produce light resonant
with the 2S1/2(F = 2)
2P3/2 transition at 313 nm.
We employ doubly–resonant sum frequency generation
(SFG) of two solid–state laser sources, a resonantly dou-
bled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm), and a Ti:Sapphire laser
at 760 nm, in a bow–tie shaped ring cavity containing
an LBO crystal [24]. The Nd:YAG laser is the master
laser and is frequency stabilized to a hyperﬁne transi-
tion of molecular iodine. By slaving the SFG cavity to
the master laser and locking the Ti:Sapphire to the cav-
ity, the sum frequency wave is also frequency stabilized.
An AOM placed before the iodine stabilization setup al-
lows to shift the UV frequency within a range of 340 MHz
while maintaining absolute frequency stability. When the
iodine stabilization is switched oﬀ, the continuous tun-
ing range exceeds 16 GHz. UV output powers of up to
100 mW were obtained. Since the Doppler cooling tran-
sition is not a closed transition spontaneous emission to
the metastable ground state 2S1/2(F = 1) is possible.
This population is removed using repumping light red
detuned by 1.250 GHz, produced by an electrooptic mod-
ulator. To minimize the eﬀect of radiation pressure force
on the crystal shape we usually use two counterpropagat-
ing laser beams. The Be+ ﬂuorescence is simultaneously
recorded with a photomultiplier and a CCD camera.

2

Our basic procedure is as follows: ﬁrst, we load the trap
with He+ ions by leaking He gas into the vacuum cham-
ber at a pressure of 10−8 mbar and ionizing it in situ by
a 750 eV electron beam crossing the trap center. The
loading rate is controlled by the partial pressure of neu-
tral He gas and the electron beam intensity. After allow-
ing for the He pressure to drop to the initial value, Be+
ions are produced by ionizing neutral atoms evaporated
from a Be oven with the same electron beam. During
Be+ loading the cooling and repumper lasers are contin-
uously scanned over a 5 GHz interval below resonance. If
necessary, mass–selective cleaning of the trap is applied
to eject heavy impurity particles prior to crystallization.
To this end, we add a static quadrupole potential VDC
to the trap until the a parameters (a = 4QVDC/mΩ2r2
0)
of the unwanted species lie outside the Mathieu stability
range. Thus, stable trapping of particles exceeding the
mass of the atomic coolants is prevented.
One of the well–known signs for a phase transition from
the ﬂuid ion plasma to an ordered crystal state is the
appearance of a sudden drop in the detected ﬂuorescence
attributed to the reduction in the particle velocities and
thus Doppler broadening. Once this occurs, the cooling
laser frequency is held constant at a red detuning of ap-
prox. half the natural linewidth (60 MHz) from the Be+
resonance. Under this condition the crystals are stable,
with a particle loss half time of

3 h.

Fig.1 shows three prolate two–component ion crystals
containing Be+ and He+. The crystals display the well-
known shell structure and enclose an inner dark region
originating from the incorporated sympathetically cooled
particles having a lower mass–to–charge ratio than that
of the atomic coolants. Their location on–axis is due to
Q2/m for a strongly
the stronger eﬀective potential (
prolate trap, ωr ≫
ωz) experienced by them as com-
pared to the Be+ ions, see Eq.(1). While Fig.1 a was
taken with an axially symmetric potential, in Fig.1 b,c a
static quadrupole potential VDC was added so as to make
the region occupied by the He+ more visible. The added
potential turns the spheroidal crystal into an ellipsoid,
squeezing the crystal in a direction at 45◦ to the obser-
vation direction [25]. This results in a redistribution of
the ions such that fewer or no Be+ ions remain in front
and behind the He+ ions. The shapes of large Coulomb
crystals containing a small relative amount of He+ ions
agree well with the cold ﬂuid plasma model [25, 26].
The number of crystallized particles is estimated by per-
forming molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and vary-
ing the number of particles until the observed CCD
image is reproduced. While for single–species struc-
tures one may obtain the particle number from the
cold ﬂuid model, which yields a particle density n0 =
ǫ0V 2
104/mm3 for Be+), together with
measured dimensions, here the MD approach is better
suited.
It is applicable to multi–species structures, in
addition produces detailed structural information, and

by Qe = ǫ0Ve∆Utrap/Q, where Ve is the volume enclosed
by the surface and a harmonic trap has been assumed,
∆Utrap(r) = const. The Laplacian also determines the
constant charge density ρ = ǫ0∆Utrap/Q = n0Q of an
ion species within the liquid charge model. Thus, the en-
closed charge is simply the ”displaced charge”, Qe = ρVe.
We now apply this to the heavier particle species sur-
rounding a cylindrical core containing lighter ions. Tak-
ing as the surface the cylinder bounded by the innermost
Be+–shell in Fig. 1 a (radius rshell ≃
35 µm) and extend-
2.2 mm), the es-
ing to the ends of the dark core (length
timate for the light species number is NHe = Qe/QHe =
260. This is in reasonable agreement
QBen0,BeVe/QHe ≃
(within a factor of 2) with the MD simulations, consider-
ing that rshell clearly varies over the crystal length and
the approximations made.
In order to identify the sympathetically cooled and crys-
tallized ions we have performed mass spectroscopy by
mass–selective excitation of transverse (secular) motion
in the trap. A plate electrode was placed between two
trap rods and an ac voltage applied (1 V amplitude). A
secular scan is taken by varying the excitation frequency
ωext/2π and recording the Be+ ﬂuorescence with the pho-
tomultiplier. The secular excitation pumps energy into
the crystal; the resulting higher Be+ ion velocities imply
a line broadening. This leads to less ﬂuorescence if the
laser frequency lies near resonance, as is the case when
the detuning is optimized for maximum cooling. This ef-
fect occurs for excitation of any species: since the species
are strongly coupled by Coulomb interaction, heating of
one species will lead to energy transfer to the others.
Fig.2 shows images for a large two–component ion crys-
tal before (a) and after (c) secular scans. Initially, the
secular scan shows the presence of both Be+ (resonance
at 283 kHz) and He+ (685 kHz). The former value is
close to the calculated value of 271 kHz. Regarding the
He+ resonance, we notice both an increase in ﬂuorescence
before resonance, and a substantial shift of the resonance
peak from the theoretical value (613 kHz). We attribute
this spread and shift to a modiﬁcation of the secular fre-
quency ωr, which is a single-particle property, by the z–
dependence of the Be+ ion distribution. The permanent
increase of the ﬂuorescence intensity level before reaching
the sharp He+ secular excitation peak is due to removal
of He+ ions from certain regions of the crystal by the
high excitation amplitude.
After a few secular excitation cycles the He+ ions were
nearly completely removed from the trap, Fig. 2 c, leav-
ing behind a nearly pure Be+ ion crystal, as evidenced
by the absence of secular resonance in Fig. 2 d. The small
number of impurities remaining in the left end of the crys-
tal did not lead to a ﬂuorescence signal. Note that the
visible crystal size has decreased substantially because
of Be+ ion loss. Nevertheless, the absolute ﬂuorescence
intensity of the ﬁnal Be+ crystal is essentially equal to
the level at the end of the ﬁrst secular scan. This may

reduces uncertainties related to the calibration of the
imaging system magniﬁcation. For example, MD sim-
ulations of the crystal in Fig.1 a show that it contains
103 Be+ ions and 150 He+ ions. The
approximately 6.2
radial intershell distance is obtained as 29 µm. This value
agrees well with the result calculated for inﬁnite planar
plasma crystals, 1.48 (3/4πn0)1/3 = 29.2 µm. According
to the simulations, the He+ ions are arranged in a zig–
zag conﬁguration along the trap axis for two–thirds of
the crystal, with a pitch spacing of
40 µm. In the re-
maining third (left end of the crystal) the He+ ions form
a linear string, as evidenced by the smaller radial exten-
sion of the inner dark core. The asymmetric distribution
is caused by light pressure forces on the Be+ ions. Em-
bedded strings were also observed in a mixed crystal of
Ca+ and Mg+ ions where both ions were laser cooled
[27].
An alternative way to roughly estimate the number of
sympathetically cooled He+ ions is as follows. Crystal-
lized ions of any species are in force equilibrium at their
locations ri. Thus, in a region occupied by a particu-
lar species, the space charge electric ﬁeld takes on the
values QE(ri) =
Utrap(ri). Consider now a closed
smooth surface that is chosen such that it closely ap-
proaches many ion loci ri. We assume this relation ap-
proximately holds on the entire surface. Applying Gauss’
law, the total charge Qe enclosed by the surface is given

of the sympathetic temperature may be obtained from
the temperature of the laser–cooled ions. We deduce a
direct upper limit for the translational temperature of
the Be+ ions from the spectral line shape of their ﬂuo-
rescence as the cooling laser is tuned towards resonance
and the ion ensemble crystallizes. Since the tempera-
ture of the particles changes during the frequency scan,
we ﬁt an appropriate Voigt proﬁle to each point of the
recorded ﬂuorescence curve to determine the Be+ tem-
perature. For small crystals (<1000 particles), we ﬁnd
an upper limit for the temperature at the end of the scan
of 42 mK. An indirect upper limit is obtained by compar-
ing the size of the ion spots with MD simulations; here we
ﬁnd a tighter limit of <20 mK for the Be+ temperature.
We therefore deduce, assuming thermal equilibrium, that
the He+ temperature is <20 mK.
In summary, we have sympathetically cooled and crys-
tallized He+ ions using laser–cooled Be+ ions in a linear
103 Be+
Paul trap. Large Coulomb crystals of
ions contained about 150 He+ ions, arranged in a zig–
zag structure centered on the trap axis. The mass ratio
of 0.44 between sympathetically cooled and laser–cooled
ions is the lowest achieved so far for large ion ensembles
in a Paul trap. We estimate the temperature of the crys-
tallized He+ ions at below 20 mK.
Translationally cold and immobilized He+ ions are a
promising system for high precision spectroscopy and
might lead to more precise atomic and nuclear constants.
The weak 1 S - 2 S transition in He+ could be detected
with high signal to noise ratio using a single adjacent Be+
ion as a ”quantum sensor”, rather than by direct detec-
tion of its ﬂuorescence [28]. Signiﬁcant progress in this
direction has been achieved [23, 29]. Moreover, sympa-
thetically cooled He+ opens up perspectives for studies
of cold collisions and cold chemistry, e.g. generation of
3HeH+ molecules, whose hyperﬁne structure is of inter-
est in fundamental physics [30].
The 4He+/9Be+ cooling and crystallization results also
have implications for the possibility of achieving this with
highly charged atomic ions (HCAI). Favorably, the q pa-
rameters are similar and the eﬀective potential, Eq. (1),
is steeper for the HCAIs than for the 9Be+. Under ap-
propriate conditions, the laser–cooled 9Be+ ions are ex-
pected to cage the HCAIs, leading to eﬃcient cooling, as
demonstrated with 4He+.

be explained by a lower ion temperature or reduced mi-
cromotion. Moreover, a shift of the crystal with respect
to the trap occurred in the direction of the propagation
of the laser beam. We attribute this to stronger light
pressure forces experienced by the Be+ ions, which is
consistent with the increased ﬂuorescence level per ion.
A central question concerning sympathetically cooled
ions is their translational temperature; several observa-
tions can shed light on the answer. A direct measure-
ment on 24Mg+ embedded in a laser–cooled 40Ca+ crystal
yielded an upper limit of 45 mK, deduced from the 24Mg+
laser excitation linewidth [20]. In a two–ion crystal sym-
pathetic cooling to the Doppler–limit (<1 mK) has been
shown [23]. MD simulations for small particle numbers
have shown that sympathetic ions caged by laser-cooled
ions are essentially in thermal equilibrium with the lat-
ter at the Doppler temperature [22]. Thus, an estimate

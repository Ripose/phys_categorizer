Absorption Line Shape of a One-Dimensional Bose Gas

Abstract

We discuss the line shape for an internal state transition for bosonic atoms
conﬁned as a one-dimensional gas. Typical line shape is an edge singularity
due to the absence of Bose-Einstein Condensation in such systems.

PACS numbers: 03.75.Fi

Recent progress in trapped bosonic gases has stimulated a lot of activities in the study
of many-body eﬀects in such systems. Most theoretical papers concentrate on eﬀects due
to the existence of the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) and the associated macroscopic
wave-function. With current techniques, it is likely that one can as well study an eﬀectively
one-dimensional (1D) trapped gas [1]. This situation occurs when the bosons are put in
a trap which is tightly conﬁning in two directions ( y and z) but is essentially free in the
third (x), and with particles occupying only the lowest quantized subband for motions in
the y-z plane. This system is unique in that, for any ﬁnite interaction among the bosons,
there is no Bose-Einstein Condensation even at zero temperature. [2]. The long-wavelength
quantum ﬂuctuations destroy the phase coherence of the system in the macroscopic limit.
For a given density n, the occupation number N0 of the lowest single particle state, though
in general increases with the size and hence the total number of particles N in the system, is
nevertheless only a negligible fraction of the total ( lim
0 ). Though many properties
N→∞
of 1D bose gas have been studied in the past [2], the subject remains somewhat academic
since there exists no physical realization. The possibility of realizing this 1D bose gas has
already stimulated some more theoretical work on this system recently [3,4]

The present 1D bosonic system is closely related to its fermionic counterpart; and they are
collectively known as the “Luttinger liquids” [5]. One-dimensional fermionic systems have
been studied much more extensively in the context of quantum wires, carbon nanotubes
[6,7] etc. There the one-dimensional nature leads to the absence of fermi liquid behavior, so
the properties of the system is qualitatively diﬀerent from its non-interacting counterpart.
The atomically trapped 1D bose gas oﬀers us an excellent new opportunity to study the
peculiar properties of quantum systems in reduced dimensions, in particular the consequence
due to the absence of BEC. Not only that this is the ﬁrst 1D bosonic system available, it
provides advantages over the mentioned 1D fermionic cases in that the present system is
intrinsically clean, and moreover numerous atomic and optical tools can now be used. It
may even be possible to further study novel systems such as mixtures etc.

In this paper we consider one such example, namely the absorption line shape of an
optical transition in this 1D bose gas. We imagine initially a quasi-1d system of bosons in
their internal ground state (referred to as the ‘a-atoms’ below). An incident optical wave
excites one of the atoms to a diﬀerent internal state. We are interested in the absorption

1

→

line shape of this process; i.e., the probability that the absorption takes place at a given
frequency Ω. We shall consider the problem at T = 0, paying particular attention to the
special feature due to the absence of BEC. An analogous experiment has already been done
2s transition in hydrogen [8]. For a uniform 3D bose
in a three dimensional trap for the 1s
gas at T = 0, the line is expected to be narrow, Lorentzian (see, e.g. [9], c.f. however [8])
with a width governed by the small ‘gaseous parameter(s)’ (n3da3)1/2. Here n3d is the particle
number density in 3d and a(’s) is (are) the s-wave scattering length(s) for scattering among
the bosons. For this three dimensional case, the main weight of the transition comes from
exciting a particle from momentum ~p = 0. There is a macroscopic number of such particles.
For a weakly interacting gas, the potential felt by the rest of the bosons is only slightly
modiﬁed after the transition. We shall see that the situation in 1D is very diﬀerent due
to the absence of BEC. Exciting a single particle necessitates a substantial rearrangement
of the relative motion among the rest of the particles, i.e., emission of a large number of
phonons. The basic line shape is typically an edge singularity.

We shall then consider an atomic trap with tight conﬁnement in the y-z directions. For
deﬁniteness we shall assume that the conﬁnement potentials in these directions are isotropic
and harmonic, with frequency ω⊥. We shall consider the case where the atoms are limited
within 0 < x < L but otherwise free. A weak harmonic trap potential along the x-axis has
been considered in the past [10,11], and the low dimensional eﬀects have been shown to be
signiﬁcantly reduced. We shall assume that such a potential is absent here. We shall further
ignore the eﬀect due to ﬁniteness of L, a condition which we shall return below.

The bosonic system is described by a Hamiltonian containing the kinetic energy and a
short-range interaction among the bosons. Anticipating that we shall eventually study the
system in the quasi-1d limit, the ﬁeld operator for the original bosons, referred to hereafter
j ψaj(x)χj(~r⊥) where ψa(x) is
as the a-bosons, is expanded as ψa(~r) = ψa(x)χ0(~r⊥) +
the annihilation operator for the a-bosons in the lowest subband (0) where the transverse
wavefunction is χ0(~r⊥). ψaj(x)’s ( j = 1, 2, ...) are the corresponding operators for the
higher subbands (wavefunctions χj(~r⊥)). In the ground state
G >= 0 since all
particles reside in the lowest subband. We shall see that ψaj for j = 1, 2, ... will not appear
anywhere below, and can pretend that the expansion of ψa(~r) will consist thus only the term
involving the lowest subband. The extent of the wavefunction χ0 in the y-z direction will
be denoted as a⊥. For harmonic trapping potentials in these directions a⊥ =

G >, ψaj(x)

We shall not write down the interaction part of the Hamiltonian involving the a-bosons
explicitly since we won’t need it below. For delta-function type interactions it is possible to
write down all the formal many-body wavefunctions [12]. Unfortunately manipulations of
such wavefunctions are typically very mathematically involved. Moreover we shall eventually
be interested in ‘ﬁnal’ states where an a-atom has been excited internally. Such wavefunc-
tions, where eﬀectively there is a ‘foreign’ atom present, are not known (with an exception
noted below). We thus proceed rather diﬀerently and follow Haldane [5], concentrating only
on the low energy excitations which are density oscillations in the system. The ﬁeld operator
p apeipx/√L) describing the motion along x is re-expressed in terms of density
ψa(x) ( =
n(x) and phase φ(x) by ψa(x) = [n(x)]1/2eiφ(x). The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the 1d motion
can be written as

θ(x) must be considered as operators satisfying the commutation relation [φ(x),

sionless) Luttinger liquid interaction parameter. vK = πno¯h/m and K is related to the
compressibility of the system via K = πv¯h(∂no/∂µ) where no is the linear number density
and µ is the chemical potential of the system. K depends on the interaction among the
bosons. For short range interactions, K in principle have already been obtained [5,12] but
there is no general analytic form known. We simply note here that K = 1 for the strongly
repulsive (impenetrable) limit while K

if the interaction among the bosons is weak.

Now we consider the external optical ﬁeld responsible for the transition in inter-
nal state. Since the atom with a new internal state is distinguishable from the origi-
nal atoms, we shall call the resulting atom the ‘c-atom’. For deﬁniteness we consider
only the ‘Doppler-free’ part of the spectrum ( no momentum transfer from the exciting
laser beam(s)) and assume that the perturbation responsible for the excitation is uniform
throughout the 1D bose gas. The relevant part of the Hamiltonian can be then written as
where ψc(~r) is the ﬁeld operator for the atom in
Hex = w
the excited internal state. We are interested in the rate of transition as a function of the
excitation frequency Ω. This rate I(Ω) is given simply by the golden rule:

(1) An atom in the internal state c is not aﬀected at all by the trapping potential for
the atoms in state a. This is possible if, e.g., this potential is due to a laser with frequency
near a dipole resonance for the a-atoms but far away from any of those for c. In this case
the c-atom escapes from the trap and no longer interacts with the remaining a-atoms.

(2) The c-atom also feels the strong transverse conﬁnement potential. It remains inside

the trap and continues to interact with the a-atoms.

We shall treat these two cases in turn.

In this case the ﬁnal state is simply a product state,

is proportional to a delta function at the Bogoliubov mode frequency (with an additional
small incoherent part). The lack of a delta function in the present case reﬂects the absence
of a condensate. If ~p can be independently measured this experiment would be analogous
to angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy employed extensively in recent studies of high
T-c cuprates [13].

Case 2:

In this case the ﬁnal result depends on the interaction between the a and c
atoms, which has the general form gac
a(~r)ψa(~r). Here gac is deﬁned in 3D
and is related to the 3D scattering length aac by gac = 4π¯haac/m . We express ψc(~r) also in
subbands ψc(~r) =
j ψcj(x)χcj(~r⊥). The ﬁnal states in eq (3) in general can involve terms
that are oﬀ-diagonal in the band index j for the c-atom due to the interaction between a
and c. Such processes correspond to the possibility that the transverse motion of the c-
atom be modiﬁed due to the interaction with the a-atoms. For a tight trap however, these
contributions are small in the dilute limit. They involve the parameter nogac/πa2

involving the interaction. H int
cj then produces ‘scattering’ terms where the momentum of the
c-atom is changed from one value to the other. The resulting calculation does not seem to
be tractable analytically in general. The problem however can be simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly
if we assume that gac,jj is small (condition given below) and concentrate again on the low
frequency limit, i.e., just above the threshold for transition into the j-th subband (given by
µ + u + gac,jjn1d to lowest order in gac). In this case transitions must be made
ξcj = ǫcj −
to states where the momenta p of the c-atom are small. Provided that p << mv, then the
kinetic energy (of motion along x) transferred to the c-atom p2/2m is much less than that
to the density oscillations of a-atoms vp. Thus so long as we are interested in frequency
deviations ∆Ω from the threshold which satisfy ∆Ω << mv2, one can ignore the kinetic
energy of the motion of the c-atoms along x. For an impenetrable bose gas this amounts to
limiting ourselves to ∆Ω << π2¯h2/ml2. Ignoring thus the ﬁrst term in H (1)

the result back in real space, we obtain

where the eﬀective interaction Hamiltonian ˜Ha,int acts only on the a-atoms and is given by
gac,jjψ†
a(0)ψa(0). This result can be understood physically as follows: the external optical
cj transition at t = 0 and at a general location say x0, annihilating
ﬁeld produces an a
an a-atom while producing a c-atom there in the j-th subband. Since the c atom moves
with velocity p/m whereas the sound waves move with the speed v, at small p the c-atom
is essentially stationary. For t > 0, due to the c-atom created, a delta-function interaction
at x0 acts on the a-atoms. We are interested in the overlap between the initial state with
an a-atom destroyed at x0 and the ﬁnal states with this extra interaction potential. This
overlap is independent of the location of the transition x0 which then has been set to 0. The
problem has thus become similar to that of X-ray absorption in solid state physics. There
initially ( t < 0) one has an electron gas in its ground state. At t = 0 an X-ray photon is
absorbed which creates a charged nuclei with an extra electron added to the electron gas,
which at t > 0 feels an extra local potential due to the charged nuclei. Notice however there
are slight diﬀerences. Here for t < 0 we have an equilibrium 1D interacting bose gas and at
t > 0 there is one less boson than initially.

The correlation function in (11) and thus the line shape can be found analogous to the
X-ray problem [14]. The expectation value needed can be rewritten as < ψ†(0)e−i ˜Htψ(0) >

It is instructive to compare this result with that of the X-ray problem when the interac-
tion between the nucleus after the X-ray and the electrons is modelled by a delta-function
interaction of strength V . There the long time behavior of the corresponding correlation
1/[∆Ω]1−αX with αX = [1 + N(0)V ]2,
function is given by 1/tαX and the line shape is
where N(0) is the density of states at the fermi level for the electron gas [14]. Here, the
interaction strength is replaced by gac,jj and the density of states is replaced by ∂n
πvN ¯h.
In both cases the power law line shapes (for αX 6
= 0) are due to ‘orthogonal
catastrophe’, that the overlap between the state just after the excitation and the new ground
state of the system vanishes. There are however two diﬀerences: the + sign in αX is replaced
sign since now there is one less boson at t > 0 rather than one more electron in the
by a
X-ray absorption problem. The decay of DR
j is smaller) if gac > 0:
near the location of the excitation, the reduction in local density of the a-atoms is also what
an interaction with gac > 0 prefers. The factor 1/2K arises from the fact that we have a
one-dimensional interacting bose gas rather than a three-dimensional fermi liquid.
As the repulsive interaction gac,jj between the a and c atoms increases, α′

j decreases
and the line sharpens up. The above quantitive result for the exponents α′
j however holds
only for small gac,jj ( << πvN ¯h ). In the limit where interactions among all the bosons are
strongly repulsive, one reaches the impenetrable limit where the bosons cannot pass each
other. In this limit the statistics, i.e., the indistinguishability among the a-bosons and the
distinguishability between the a- and c- bosons become irrelevant. One can check that the
wavefunctions written down in [15] for a system of identical bosons only can be generalized
to the present case if we replace one of the bosons by the foreign c-atom. It can be further
veriﬁed that the absorption line shape becomes delta functions (one for each subband cj) in
this impenetrable limit.

j (t) in time is slower (α′

The experimental observation of the line shape discussed above should be feasible. The
possibility of obtaining a quasi-1D bose gas has already been discussed in ref [1]. The above
line-shape is applicable so long as ∆Ω <

100kHz, much larger than the present available experimental resolutions. It is suﬃcient
for the temperature T to be small compared with the line-width. The condition T << ωl
is satisﬁed for T < µK, a temperature readily achievable. A ﬁnite length L of the system
will break the line into a set of discrete sub-lines with separations of order π2¯h/mL2, but
the shape of the ‘line’ can still be observable as long as L >> l.

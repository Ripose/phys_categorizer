We theoretically examine photoassociation of a dual Fermi degenerate gas, with a foucus on ad-
justing atom-atom interactions so as to raise the critical temperature of the BCS transition to a
superﬂuid state. As it stands, extremely far-oﬀ resonant light (detuning ∼ 1014 Hz) is required to
overcome spontaneous decay, leading to enormous intensity requirements (∼ 108 W/cm2) [ Mackie
et al., Opt. Express 8, 118 (2000)]. However, by considering photoassociation to a pair of molecular
levels, and adjusting the phase of the laser to allow for destructive interference of spontaneous decay,
superﬂuidity can be delivered within reach of existing experiments for modest values of intensity.

Studies of degeneracy in dual Fermi gases [1,2] cur-
rently face a bottleneck in the push to reach temperatures
cold enough to form Cooper pairs: When the tempera-
ture of the dual gas falls below the Fermi temperature,
TF , evaporative cooling begins to stall as the lowest en-
ergy states become occupied with near-unit probability,
and Pauli blocking thereby ampliﬁes technical diﬃculties
to limit the lowest achieved temperature to about a third
of the Fermi temperature [3]. Meanwhile, the formation
of Cooper pairs requires a further reduction in tempera-
ture of at least an order of magnitude [4,5]. However,
by adjusting atom-atom interactions, it appears feasi-
ble to raise the temperature of the BCS transition to
an experimentally accessable regime. Competing means
of adjustment include the Feshbach resonance [6–8], rf
microwave ﬁelds [9], dc electric ﬁelds [10], and photoas-
sociation [11–13].

Both photoassociation [14] and the Feshbach resonance
[15,16] have recently been proposed for driving superﬂu-
idity in a Fermi degenerate gas of atoms; but in either
case the molecular state can be a liability. For the Fesh-
bach resonance, the bound state lies very close to the dis-
sociation threshold, and the subsequent sensativity, e.g.,
to collisions will limit the lifetime of the Cooper pair– an
issue not yet fully addressed. On the other hand, pho-
toassociation generally occurs to an excited electronic
state, and the superﬂuid lifetime is limited by sponta-
neous emmission.
Indeed, a one second lifetime and a
critical temperature of a tenth the Fermi temperature
requires a far-far-oﬀ resonant photoassociation laser (de-
1014 Hz) and, consequently, an enormous light
tuning
intensity (

108 W/cm2) [14].

∼

The purpose of this Letter is therefore to develop a
means for inducing the BCS transition to a superﬂuid
state that is both robust and user-friendly. We consider
photoassociation of a dual Fermi gas of atoms occurring
to a pair of excited-state molecular levels. A proper in-
clusion of spontaneous decay indicates that, for a judi-

∼

cous choice of phase for the photoassociating laser (caus-
ing the two dipoles to oscillate exactly out of step), the
joint molecular emmission interferes destructively, bring-
ing superﬂuidity into the experimentally accessable tem-
perature regime for only modest intensity requirements.
Presently degenerate fermions are 40K [1] and 6Li [2],
and before closing we estimate speciﬁc values for these
systems.

We model a binary mixture of fermionic atoms, de-
noted by the ﬁelds φ1,2(r), photoassociating into two
diﬀerent bosonic molecules, denoted by ψ1,2(r), as sys-
tem which is of course the neutral particle version of
the boson-fermion model of high-temperature supercon-
ductivity [17]. Instead of electrons, the fermions herein
would typically be two states with diﬀerent z components
of angular momentum in the same atom, which avoids
any Pauli blocking of s-wave photoassociation. Again, a
generic free-bound transition via photon absorption leads
to a molecule that is unstable against spontaneous em-
mission and, since there is no particular reason why this
decay should deposit the ensuing population back into
the Fermi degenerate gas, such a molecule is considered
lost for our purposes. Consequently, assuming photoas-
sociation occuring to vibrational levels in the same elec-
tronic manifold, we add a non-Hermitian term propor-
tional to the spontaneous decay rate of the excited elec-
tronic state γ, and incorporate the possiblity for inter-
frence by appropriately adding molecular amplitudes.

Turning to the sought-after increase in the BCS transi-
tion temperature, we ignore the native scattering length
a on the assumption that the associated collisional inter-
action is already too weak for experimental utility. The
atom-atom interactions are now due solely to the light

and the choice of δ < 0 gives the attraction necessary
for the Cooper pairing. Having assumed the detuning
is large enough to allow for adiabatic elimination of the
molecular ﬁeld, the rigorous Fermi-Bose thermodynam-
ics will reduce to the usual BCS theory [16]; hence,
the critical temperature for the superﬂuid transition is

From Eq. (6), it is clear that the spontaneous decay of

Focusing on the experimentally relevent systems,
40K [1] and 6Li [2], the ﬁxed parameter values are listed
in Table I. Assuming adiabatic elimination is enabled
for a detuning much greater than a typical linwidth, say,
= 200 MHz, and that Tc = 0.1 TF is accessable, the es-
δ

timated intensity requirements are IK = 10 W/cm2 and
ILi = 0.05 W/cm2. Photoassociation therefore provides
a means for creating a superﬂuid state with a coherently
controlled lifetime that is well within reach of current
experiments.

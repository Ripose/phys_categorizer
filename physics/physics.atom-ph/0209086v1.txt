Two-photon E1M1 transition rates are evaluated for heliumlike ions with nuclear charges in the
range Z = 50–94. The two-photon rates modify previously published lifetimes/transition rates of
2 3P0 states. For isotopes with nuclear spin I 6= 0, where hyperﬁne quenching dominates the 2 3P0
decay, two-photon contributions are signiﬁcant; for example, in heliumlike 187Os the two-photon
correction is 3% of the total rate. For isotopes with I = 0, where the 2 3P0 decay is unquenched,
the E1M1 corrections are even more important reaching 60% for Z=94. Therefore, to aid in the
interpretation of experiments on hyperﬁne quenching in heliumlike ions and to provide a more
complete database for unquenched transitions, a knowledge of E1M1 rates is important.

INTRODUCTION

II. THEORY

In recent years, accurate calculations of decay rates of
2 3P0 states of heliumlike ions have been performed for
nuclear charges Z ≤ 94, with [1, 2] and without [3] con-
sideration of hyperﬁne quenching. Single photon decay
of the 2 3P0 state to the ground state is strictly forbidden
by angular momentum selection rules and only a weak E1
decay to the 2 3S1 state or an even weaker M1 decay to the
2 3P1 state is possible for isotopes with nuclear spin I = 0.
For isotopes with I 6= 0, weak transitions induced by the
hyperﬁne interaction also are possible. Until now, cor-
rections to 2 3P0 decay rates associated with two-photon
E1M1 decay have been neglected. For low-Z ions, those
corrections are extremely tiny, scaling as Z 12; however,
for ions such as U+90, the E1M1 decay rate is comparable
to the single-photon rate as shown by Drake [4]. Two-
photon E1M1 rates are also expected to be signiﬁcant
for heavy two-electron ions other than U+90 and calcula-
tions are needed. To date, the only ion with Z > 50 for
which a measurement of hyperﬁne quenching has been
made is heliumlike gadolinium [2]; for the isotope 155Gd,
the E1M1 correction to the lifetime is only 0.08%.

We evaluate two-photon E1M1 transition rates for
2 3P0 states of heliumlike ions with Z = 50–94. The E1M1
rate is a smooth function of Z that follows approximately
the Z 12 law predicted by Drake [4]. Revised lifetimes
of 2 3P0 states for isotopes with I 6= 0, where hyperﬁne
quenching occurs, are also given. Additionally, we give
3P0 → 11S0 rates for ions with Z = 50 − 94 having I = 0.
Although E1M1 transitions are very interesting for rela-
tivistic theories, because of the very large negative-energy
contributions to the transition amplitudes, direct mea-
surements of E1M1 transitions have not yet been made.

A. Two-photon E1M1 transition rate

The diﬀerential transition probability for the two-
photon E1M1 decay, after summation over the photon
polarization states and integration over photon angles,
takes the form

where the photon frequencies are related by energy con-
servation, ω1 + ω2 = Ef − Ei and the two-photon matrix
element M (1, 2) is given by,

M (1, 2) =

In this equation, i, f , and n designate initial, ﬁnal, and
intermediate states. Permutation of arguments in the
matrix element M (1, 2) means that ω1 and ω2 should be
interchanged in the denominators and in the arguments
of dipole matrix elements. Compared to the expression
for the 2E1 transition rate given in Ref. [5], there is the
extra factor α2/4, owing to diﬀerences between magnetic
and electric dipole matrix elements.

in a local potential

The matrix element M (1, 2) is gauge invariant. The
diﬀerence between the length and velocity forms of
the electric-dipole moment
is
hi |∆E1(ω)| ji = a(Ei − Ej − ω) hi |χ(ω)| ji, where χ(ω) is
the gauge operator deﬁned in Ref. [3] and a is a constant
of proportionality. Using this relation, the completeness
of the basis, and the commutativity of M1(ω2) and χ(ω1),
we ﬁnd that the length-velocity diﬀerence is for the ﬁrst
term

hi |∆E1(ω1)| ni hn |M1(ω2)| f i
Ei − En − ω1

= a hi |χ(ω1)M1(ω2)| f i

and for the second term

hi |M1(ω2)| ni hn |∆E1(ω1)| f i
Ei − En − ω2

= −a hi |M1(ω2)χ(ω1)| f i .

Adding the two terms, we obtain ∆M (1, 2) = 0. The
numerical calculations discussed below give precise seven-
digit gauge invariance, in harmony with the theoretical
prediction.

After summation over magnetic substates, the two-

photon matrix element can be further simpliﬁed,

The quantity M (1, 2) is expressed in terms of reduced

where SM1 = |hi ||M1(ω)|| f i|2 , gi is degeneracy of the

We consider two-photon decay of the 3P0 level in the
single-conﬁguration approximation, similar to Ref.
[4].
The initial state is |ii = |1s2p1/2 [0] i , the intermediate
states are |ni = |1sns [1] i (n 6= 1) or |1snd [1] i, and the
ﬁnal state is the ground state |f i = |1s2 [0] i. Substitut-
ing these states into (Eq. 3) we arrive at the expression
for the two-photon amplitude used in our calculations:

M (1, 2) =

With the aid of the expressions for the reduced two-
electron matrix elements given explicitly in [3, p. 264],
we can rewrite (Eq. 4) in terms of single-electron reduced
matrix elements, leading to a result in agreement with
that given by Drake [4].

B. Line shape

One problem of two-photon expressions is distinguish-
ing between “pure” and cascade two-photon processes.
The separation is needed for calculations of a total rate
since the cascade process is already included in a single-
photon decay rate but the pure two-photon process is
not. (Actually, this provides a good deﬁnition for a cas-
cade process.) Although for the oﬀ-resonance contribu-
tion the cascade process is negligible, near the resonance
it dominates. In [4], the subtraction of quadratic reso-
nant terms was used to calculate the pure two-photon
contribution. Since some details are not clear, we de-
scribe in the appendix a subtraction procedure in more

detail. We deﬁne a cascade process as the quadratic res-
onant term with a ﬁxed frequency in the numerator (this
was not stated in [4] and is important). This deﬁnition is
reasonable because it gives a Lorentzian proﬁle and after
integration over frequencies of the resonant photon the
expected single-photon rate, provided one resonant chan-
nel dominates as is the case. Subtracting this cascade
process from the total two-photon contribution, we can
deﬁne the pure two-photon spectrum. Near resonance
portion of the spectrum becomes closely antisymmetric
and upon symmetric integration will contribute insignif-
icantly. Resonant contributions can then be discarded
placing grid points far away from resonant regions and
the pure two-photon contribution can be trivially eval-
uated.
In the Appendix, we analyze the line shape of
the pure two-photon spectrum near the strong resonance
(there is also a second, weaker resonance but its contri-
bution is less important).

III. NUMERICAL METHOD

Since we wish to consider highly-charged ions, we base
our calculations on the Dirac equation. To treat small
correlation eﬀects, of order 1/Z, we use three starting
potentials: Coulomb potential with Z = Zion, Coulomb
potential with Z = Zion − 1, and the model potential
V (r) = −Z/r + v0(1s, r), where v0(1s, r) is the electro-
static potential of a single 1s electron. Among the three,
the model potential takes into account correlations most
completely, in that experimental energy levels are closely
reproduced. Therefore, in our ﬁnal compilation of two-
photon rates, the model potential results are used.

To carry out the sum over intermediate states, for each
of the three potentials we use a B-spline basis set con-
sisting of 40 positive-energy and 40 negative-energy basis
orbitals for each angular momentum state constrained
to a cavity of radius R = 92/Zion a0. The complete-
ness of this basis is reﬂected by precise gauge invariance:
for example, in the Coulomb potential Z = 92 for he-
liumlike uranium, the reduced two-photon matrix ele-
ments in the length and the velocity forms are M (1, 2)l =
2.9395608×10−6 and M (1, 2)v = 2.9395610×10−6. Neg-
ative energy contributions, which almost for 2E1 transi-
tions are small, are important in the case of E1M1 tran-
sitions.

Since four of the terms in Eq. (4) have resonant en-
ergy denominators and the two-photon transition rate is
extremely sensitive to photon frequencies (∼ ω3
2), we
replace the approximate lowest-order energies by accu-
rate two-electron energies in these four terms: Ei →
E(1s2 1S0), E1s2s[1] → E(1s2s 3S1), E1s2p1/2[1] →
E(1s2p 3P0), and E1s2p3/2[1] → E(1s2p 1P1), where the
accurate energies E(1snl 1,3LJ ) are taken from Plante
[6]. Similar replacements were used by Drake [4] in his
calculations of the two-photon rate for U90+.

IV. RESULTS

Using the procedure described in previous section, we
compute the two-photon transition rates according to the
Eq(1) and after subtraction resonances integrate the dif-
ferential rate to obtain the total two-photon rate. Since
the behavior of the rates with Z is very smooth, we per-
formed calculations only for eleven diﬀerent ions. Table I
summarizes our results for total transition rates. The
three potentials, discussed above, give results in close
agreement, but the model potential for which length-
velocity agreement ranges 0.4-1.5% and so does approxi-
mately accuracy should be considered the most accurate.
(The precise gauge-invariance is achieved when denomi-
nators are not modiﬁed in all three cases.) For U90+our
Coulomb Z potential result (5.567 × 109 s−1) agrees well
with Drake’s [4] (5.60 × 109 s−1) obtained in the same
potential. There is also small E2M2 contribution equal
to (0.025 × 109 s−1) which was calculated by Drake [4]

TABLE I: E1M1 total transition rates for heliumlike ions in
the range Z = 50 − 92. The rates were calculated using three
diﬀerent potentials: the Coulomb Z, the Coulomb Z−1, and a
model potential V = −Z/r + v0(1s, r). In the model potential
case, the diﬀerence between results obtained in length and
velocity forms are also shown as a measure of accuracy of
calculations.

for U90+. We will neglect it in all our calculations.

In the table, we provide one extra digit beyond accu-
racy for better interpolation. For convenience, we also
give the interpolation polynomials that ﬁt our calculated
rates with suﬃcient accuracy. In the case of the Coulomb
Z potential the polynomial is Z 12(1.28 − 6.4 × 10−3Z +
9.60×10−5Z 2); in the case of the Coulomb Z −1 potential
the polynomial is Z 12(1.22−6.4×10−3Z +9.8×10−5Z 2);
and in the case of the model potential the polynomial is
Z 12(1.29 − 7.73 × 10−3Z + 1.10 × 10−4Z 2). The rates
in all three cases as well as the ﬁtting polynomials are
shown in Fig. 1.

The upper curve corresponds to the Coulomb Z poten-
tial, the lower curve to the Coulomb Z − 1 potential, and
the middle one to the model potential.
In addition to
total rates we also show in (Fig. 2) the frequency distri-
bution of the diﬀerential two-photon transition rate for
Z = 92, Z = 79, Z = 62, and Z = 50. In the case of ura-
nium, Z = 92, the shape resembles very closely the distri-
bution given by Drake [4]. The continuous evolution with
Z can be seen: the maximum at the center monotonously
decreases with Z, but the wings are rapidly developing
for lower Z ions.

In the case of Z = 50, the wings are large; therefore we

studied the line shape more carefully with a reﬁned scale.
The discussion of the behavior near the origin, where res-
onances are located, is given in the Appendix. From this
discussion follows that the integrated contribution from
that region is not much diﬀerent from that of any other
part of the spectrum. Since we discovered that E1M1
corrections are signiﬁcant for ions in the range Z=50-94,
we also correct previously calculated values of lifetimes
and transition rates for those ions. Tables II and III show
previously calculated and corrected rates. Table II gives
revised lifetimes for isotopes that have hyperﬁne induced
transitions. We show only the cases where modiﬁcation
changes quoted digits. Table III shows transition rates
without hyperﬁne mixing, when corrections owing to E1-
M1 transitions are particularly large.

The diﬀerence reaches 57.5% for Z = 94.

perimental situation, any ion shown in the table can be

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have calculated E1M1 transition rates
for heliumlike ions (Z = 50 − 94). The previous lifetime
values are improved with adding E1M1 contributions.
The large E1M1 corrections in heavy ions can be tested
in future experiments and the E1M1 transition rates can
be extracted from experiments to study those essentially
relativistic transitions.

The two-photon transition matrix element M (1, 2) has
two poles: one occurs for n = 2 in the ﬁrst term of
Eq. (4), when ω1 equals the 2 3P0 → 2 3S1 (E1) tran-
sition energy, and the second occurs for n = 2 in the
third term term, when ω1 equals the 2 3P0 → 2 3P1 (M1)
transition energy. To obtain the correct line shape, the
denominators in each of these pole terms should be mod-
iﬁed to include widths of the levels: En → En − iΓ/2.
(If the small width of the initial state is neglected, then
Γ = Γn, the width of the nth level only). The insertion
of the imaginary term leads to an almost Lorentzian pro-
ﬁle near the resonance. By subtracting the Lorentzians
corresponding to the cascade processes or simply single-
photon decays, we obtain the purely two-photon decay
rate and its spectral distribution. After subtraction, the
remaining contribution to the two-photon rate near the
resonance region becomes very small when the resonant
intermediate level is very narrow, as is the case for the in-
termediate 2 3S1 level and the resonances can be ignored
in the total two-photon rate. To check that resonant
contributions are small, we made ﬁne grid in the reso-
nant region and calculated the resonance contributions.
The cascade contribution is large and is calculated sep-
arately, using more precise methods. A precise rate for
the 2 3P0 → 2 3S1 (E1) transition is given in Ref. [3]. For
comparison with experiment, our two-photon line shape
should be added to the Lorentzian obtained using the ac-
curate line width and the single-photon transition rate.
In this paper, we will show only pure two-photon proﬁle,
i.e., what remains after resonances are subtracted.

The analysis of the relative contribution to the two-
photon rate from the resonant region, using limit that
the width is very small, gives the following expression:

In this formula the unit of frequency is chosen the res-
onant frequency ωres, I(ω) is the contribution obtained
by integration from zero to ω, I1(ω1) is the contribution
with the symmetric integration from −ω1 to +ω1 with
ω1 < 1. The integrals I1(ω1) and I(ω) are deﬁned be-
low, and the expansion over small parameter Γ have been
carried out:

The illustration of the shape of the near resonance dif-
ferential rate is given in Fig. 3. Here the case Z = 50
is considered. The diﬀerential rate near the resonance is
very large, of order 104, and is not shown here. However,
owing to a precise cancellation, the total contribution af-
ter integration is quite small.

The symmetric integral in the near resonance region
owing to very precise cancellation provides better nu-
merical accuracy than asymmetric, but far away from the
resonance when ω1 > 1, instead of the symmetric integral
the asymmetric integral has to be used. We assume that
only one strong resonance near zero where two-photon
diﬀerential rate is proportional to ω3 is present. The
integral I1(ω1) is proportional to the frequency ω1 and
to the width of the resonance, and the smaller the width
the smaller resonant contribution I(ω) will be. Using the
above equations, it can be shown that the residual reso-
nant contribution to the two-photon rate is insigniﬁcant
compared to the smooth continuum contribution.

The shape in the near resonance region can be de-

scribed approximately by the following equation

f (x) ≈

+ background

1 + x + x2
(x − 1)

if (x − 1) ≫ Γ. The background is the smooth contin-
uum contribution owing to all terms except the resonant
term. There is maximum at x = 0.012 owing to two-
photon continuum for small x behaving like xk(1 − x)3.
Depending on the position of most contributing levels,
k = 1 ÷ 3 . We show the case Z = 50 for which the wings
are the most pronounced. At the very origin, the diﬀer-
ential rate rapidly grows x3 if x is much less than the any
denominator of the terms with large contributions.

The sharp left edge of the wings is owing to the
sharp ω3 dependence of the diﬀerential rate near the
origin. The located very close to the origin subtracted
resonances, which have asymmetric shapes and narrow

widths, are shown in Fig. 3 since their diﬀerential rate
near the resonance frequency is very high and needs dif-
ferent scale. But resonant contributions also decrease so

fast that they have no eﬀect on the shown region as well
on the total rate.

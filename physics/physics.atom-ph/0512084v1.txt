We report direct single-laser excitation of the strictly forbidden (6s2) 1S0 ↔ (6s6p) 3P0 clock tran-
sition in the even 174Yb isotope conﬁned to a 1D optical lattice. A small (∼1.2 mT) static magnetic
ﬁeld was used to induce a nonzero electric dipole transition probability between the clock states
at 578.42 nm. Narrow resonance linewidths of 20 Hz (FHWM) with high contrast were observed,
demonstrating a record neutral-atom resonance quality factor of 2.6×1013. The previously unknown
ac Stark shift-canceling (magic) wavelength was determined to be 759.35 ± 0.02 nm. This method
for using the metrologically superior even isotope can be easily implemented in current Yb and Sr
lattice clocks, and can create new clock possibilities in other alkaline earth-like atoms such as Mg
and Ca.

Time and frequency standards play an integral role
in modern technologies and provide precise deﬁnitions
of fundamental quantities. Optical frequency standards,
with distinct advantages relative to microwave frequency
clocks, are rapidly approaching maturity [1]. Consider-
able strides have been taken recently toward a new clock
scheme based on large numbers of neutral atoms trapped
in optical lattices [2, 3] that are designed to have zero
net ac Stark shift on the clock transition. This type of
clock promises to combine the high signal-to-noise ra-
tios of current neutral atom standards [4] with the long
interaction times and Doppler-free spectroscopy found
in single-ion standards [5].
In this Letter, we demon-
strate the ﬁrst spectroscopy of the Yb clock transition in
a Stark-free lattice. More importantly, this demonstra-
tion is the ﬁrst precision spectroscopy of the 1S0
3P0
clock transition in an even isotope of an alkaline earth-
like atom. Realizing a recently proposed method of mag-
netic ﬁeld-induced spectroscopy [6], we observe spectro-
scopic linewidths of 20 Hz, full-width at half-maximum
(FWHM), with good contrast and signal-to-noise. This
yielded a record neutral-atom resonance quality factor of
1013. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
2.6
a lattice clock based on the metrologically superior even
isotope.

Until now, lattice clock experiments have focused on
the 1S0
3P0 clock transition in the odd isotopes of al-
kaline earth-like atoms Sr [2, 3, 7] and Yb [8, 9, 10, 11].
This transition, weakly allowed in the odd isotopes due
to hyperﬁne mixing, provides a narrow natural linewidth
millihertz) and a high degree of lattice polarization
(
∼
insensitivity. However, the nonzero nuclear spin of the
odd isotopes creates undesirable residual lattice polariza-
tion sensitivity, optical pumping issues, and linear mag-

netic ﬁeld sensitivity. The use of the even-isotope alka-
line earth-like atoms (zero nuclear spin) would essentially
eliminate these signiﬁcant experimental diﬃculties. Un-
fortunately, the direct optical excitation of this transition
in the even isotopes is forbidden due to the absence of
hyperﬁne mixing and has therefore, until now, remained
out of reach.

Multiphoton schemes to excite this even-isotope tran-
sition in Yb and Sr have recently been proposed [12, 13].
These proposals are based on relatively complex experi-
mental apparatus, requiring the use of multiple stabilized
lasers, nonlinear optics, and good control over laser ﬁeld
intensities. In contrast, the demonstration described in
this Letter uses only the addition of a small magnetic ﬁeld
to mix a fraction of a nearby state into the upper clock
state, creating a weakly allowed electric dipole transition.
Thus, a single clock laser at 578.42 nm is suﬃcient to di-
rectly excite the transition. Although the bias ﬁeld must
be made stable, this method allows one to reap extensive
gains in simplicity.

With the inherent insensitivity of the even isotopes to
lattice polarization and residual magnetic ﬁelds, this ap-
proach has the potential to provide 17 digits of accuracy
or more with only minor changes to existing lattice clock
experiments. In addition to Sr and Yb, the method can
be employed with other group II atoms (e.g. Ca, Mg),
thereby opening up new clock opportunities [6]. This
technique should expedite the development of high accu-
racy optical lattice clocks, enabling improved standards
and aiding in the search for time variations of fundamen-
tal physical constants [14].

This initial demonstration of magnetic-ﬁeld induced
spectroscopy was performed in a 1D optical lattice. In or-
der to capture atoms in the relatively weak trapping po-

FIG. 1: Magnetic ﬁeld-induced lattice spectroscopy. Approx-
imately ten thousand 174Yb atoms were cooled, trapped, and
loaded into a lattice at the Stark-free (magic) wavelength of
759.35 nm. A pair of current-carrying coils generated a static
magnetic ﬁeld to mix a small portion of the 3P1 state into the
3P0 clock state. A single 578.42 nm spectroscopic laser was
aligned collinear to the lattice with a dichroic beamsplitter.
The tight conﬁnement of the atoms in the probe direction
provided for Doppler- and recoil-free excitation of the clock
transition. Excitation was measured by ground-state ﬂuores-
cence of the atoms on the 398.9 nm transition.

tential of the lattice, two stages of laser cooling and trap-
ping were utilized. First, a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
using diode lasers on the broad transition (Γ/2π =
28 MHz) at 398.9 nm was used to cool (
millikelvin) and
collect roughly a million atoms in 300 ms. Next, this
MOT was turned oﬀ, transferring the atoms to a MOT
on the 555.8 nm intercombination line (Γ/2π = 182 kHz)
with approximately 60 % eﬃciency (See Ref.
[11] for
more details). After the atoms reached equilibrium in
25 ms), the light intensity was turned
the green MOT (
down by a factor of 10 to 100 for 25 ms to reduce the tem-
perature of the atoms to roughly 50 µK for loading into
the lattice, which is on continuously. Approximately 5 %
of the atoms in the 555.8 nm MOT were transferred into
the lattice, giving roughly 104 atoms with which to per-
form spectroscopy on the clock transition at 578.42 nm.
After the trapping light was turned oﬀ, a single spectro-
scopic pulse, collinear with the lattice, interrogated the
clock transition. Probe pulse times were kept shorter
than the 150 ms lifetime of the lattice. After applying
the spectroscopic pulse, the ﬂuoresence from a resonant
398.9 nm detection pulse (< 100 µs) was collected by a
photomultiplier, thus measuring the number of atoms re-
maining in the ground state. The spectroscopic laser was
then stepped in frequency, and the cycle was repeated
many times to generate a lineshape.

Crucial to the lattice clock scheme is the ability to
cancel out the large ac Stark perturbation of the lattice.
This is accomplished by tuning the lattice wavelength
such that the shifts on the ground and excited states
are equal, leaving the clock frequency unperturbed. This
Stark-free wavelength had been theoretically estimated
to be near 752 nm [8]. The laser for the optical lat-
tice consisted of a cw ring Ti:sapphire laser pumped at
532 nm. The Ti:sapphire laser (1.5-2.2 W output power)
was injection-locked by an external cavity diode laser to
provide unidirectional and single frequency lasing [15].
This system was tunable from 750 nm to 795 nm, allow-
ing a large range in which to search for the Stark-free
lattice wavelength. The lattice light was coupled using
a polarization maintaining ﬁber to the MOT chamber
5 mm (1/e2
where it was collimated to a beam size of
radius). The beam was then focused using a 40 cm focal
length achromatic lens onto the atoms and retroreﬂected
by a curved mirror after the chamber. The resultant spot
30 µm produced an optical lattice depth of
size of w0
tens of microkelvin for 1 W lattice power.

The yellow spectroscopic laser light at 578.42 nm was
provided by a highly stable dye laser that has been well
described elsewhere [16]. This laser has a linewidth of
< 1 Hz with typical drift rates of several hundred hertz
per day for its ultrastable reference cavity. The laser
and stabilization system were located in another labora-
200 m) with active
tory, necessitating ﬁber delivery (
noise cancellation [17, 18]. The spectroscopic light was
scanned and chopped using an acousto-optic modulator
(AOM). After passing through the AOM, the spectro-
scopic light was combined with the lattice light using
dichroic optics and focused with a common lens (see Fig.
1), giving a beam waist approximately twice that of the
lattice beam. The retroreﬂecting mirror for the lattice
was low-reﬂecting at the clock wavelength, ensuring very
little standing wave structure of the probe light.

∼

An experimentally important parameter was the mag-
netic ﬁeld-induced optical Rabi frequency [6]. From per-
turbation theory the (6s6p) 3P0 clock state acquires a
ﬁrst order correction due to nearby states in the pres-
ence of the magnetic ﬁeld. The dominant mixing term
occurs with the (6s6p) 3P1, mJ = 0 state, since all the
other terms have either vanishing magnetic dipole ma-
trix elements or are much further detuned. The induced
Rabi frequency is then given by Ω = ΩLΩB/∆, where
ΩL is the optical Rabi frequency on the (6s2)1S0

To optimize the performance of the lattice apparatus
and roughly locate the Stark-free wavelength of Yb, we
ﬁrst performed measurements on the more easily excited
173Yb clock transition. Utilizing knowledge of the iso-
tope shifts and the frequencies of the two odd 171,173Yb
isotope resonances [11], we were able limit our search for
the very narrow 174Yb resonance to
5 MHz with
respect to the 173Yb resonance. In a search for weak spec-
troscopic lines, it is desirable to work in the power broad-
ened regime to ensure signiﬁcant excitation and broaden-

in the initial search for the resonance and also allowed us
to investigate large values of the quadratic Zeeman shift.

Following the initial observation of the line, we deter-

tice, applying a 64 ms spectroscopic pulse (|B| = 1.29 mT,
I ≈ 280 mW/cm2), then measuring the ground state popula-
tion with a 398.9 nm pulse for a total cycle time of ≈ 400 ms.

and linewidths. The large intensity variation of the lat-
tice causes line broadening on the order of the diﬀer-
ential ac Stark shift, which grows as the lattice is de-
tuned from the Stark-free wavelength. Monitoring the
line broadening and the direction of the shift with in-
creasing lattice intensity, we were able to determine the
Stark-free wavelength for Yb to be 759.35

A spectrum of the carrier with the lattice tuned near

64 ms interrogation pulse (

is the highest reported line quality factor (Q
for a neutral atom transition. For pulse times less than
64 ms, we observed nominally Fourier limited lineshapes.
Increasing the pulse duration beyond 64 ms, however,
did little to reduce the linewidth below 20 Hz, indicating
broadening mechanisms. A likely cause of this broaden-
ing is the optical leakage of the AOMs used to chop the
green and blue trapping beams. Another possibility is

The spectrum shown in Fig. 3 has a signal-to-noise
ratio of approximately 10, which, with our present mea-
surement cycle, should enable a measurement precision of
2 Hz in one second. With a clock frequency of 518 THz,
this present level of performance could support a frac-
10−15 for one second
tional frequency instability of 4
averaging time. This is competitive with the performance
of the best existing frequency standards. Moreover, the
use of normalized detection and modest improvements
in the linewidth should yield improvement by an order
of magnitude in the near future. While estimates of the
absolute frequency uncertainty of this clock system (e.g.
collisional shifts) will require careful evaluations, uncer-
tainties speciﬁc to this method could be held well below
10 mHz for reasonable spectroscopic parameters [6].

To check that the excitation-enabling magnetic ﬁeld
does not lead to unmanageable clock frequency shifts, we
measured the quadratic Zeeman shift coeﬃcient, β. Us-
1 splitting of the 3P1 state to calibrate the
ing the mJ =
0.4 MHz/T2, in
magnetic ﬁeld, we determined β =
agreement with the theoretical estimate of 6.2 MHz/T2
[6]. At the -1.29 mT ﬁeld used for the spectroscopy in
Fig. 3 this gives a magnetic shift of only -11 Hz. A care-
ful calibration yielding 0.5 µT (5 mG) uncertainty for a
1 mT (10 G) bias ﬁeld would lead to a magnetic ﬁeld-
dependent uncertainty of merely 6 mHz.

The beneﬁts of using the even isotopes are consider-
able. One of the largest frequency uncertainties of the Sr
studies [2, 3] based on the odd isotopes was due to the
linear Zeeman shift, which is further exacerbated by the
complex (I = 9/2) level structure. In comparison, the
even isotopes have no magnetic substructure and only
quadratic dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld, making the
uncertainty due to the magnetic ﬁeld with our method
nearly negligible. In addition, the scalar nature of the
transition makes potential shifts due to the polarization
of the lattice virtually nonexistent. This will simplify the
move to multidimensional lattices and may enable better
control of frequency shifts due to the hyperpolarizability.
In this Letter, we have demonstrated the ﬁrst lattice-
based spectroscopy with Yb atoms. This is also the ﬁrst
even-isotope study of the 1S0
3P0 clock transition in
an alkaline earth-like atom. We have observed linewidths
as narrow as 20 Hz FWHM for 174Yb atoms conﬁned to a
1D optical lattice, yielding stability comparable with the
best existing frequency standards. This magnetic ﬁeld-
induced technique is simple to implement, applicable to
many alkaline earth-like atoms, and allows the use of the
metrologically superior even isotopes in optical lattice
clocks. The experimental simpliﬁcation associated with
this method should greatly accelerate the development of

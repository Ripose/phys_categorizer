Abstract.
In this work we present fully diﬀerential cross sections (FDCSs) calculations using post
and prior version of CDW–EIS theory for helium single ionization by 100 MeV C6+
amu−1 and 3.6 MeV amu−1 Au24+ and Au53+ ions. We performed our calculations
for diﬀerent momentum transfer and ejected electron energies. The inﬂuence of
internuclear potential on the ejected electron spectra is taken into account in all cases.
We compare our calculations with absolute experimental measurements. It is shown
that prior version calculations give better agreement with experiments in almost all
studied cases.

1. Introduction

The study of electron emission spectra in ion atom collisions has been a ﬁeld of
intense activity for years (Stolterfoht et al 1997). For intermediate to high energy
single ionization there has been considerable theoretical eﬀorts focused in the so-called
two centre electron emission (TCEE) (Fainstein et al 1991, Pedersen et al 1990).
Improvement in the description of the ionized electron moving in the presence of both
residual target and projectile ﬁelds after the collision (ﬁnal state) has been key for the
correct description of experimental data (Guly´as et al 1995).

Within distorted wave approximations, it has been shown that, at least for high
impact energy and multiply charged projectiles, CDW theory of Belki´c (1978) used
together with an appropriate description of the initial bound and ﬁnal continuum
electron states, yields best results for doubly diﬀerential cross sections (DDCSs) (Guly´as
and Fainstein 1998, Ciappina et al 2003). However, when the projectile impact velocity
decreases, the CDW–EIS theory of Crothers & McCann (1983) gives better results, its
only diﬀerence being the choice of the initial state. Moreover CDW–EIS approximation
is formally free of criticisms regarding the initial state proper normalization, and the
transition amplitudes have not the divergent behavior that CDW exhibits (Crothers
1982) (although it has been demonstrated that CDW amplitudes are integrable and its
DDCSs are well behaved) (Dub´e and Dewangan 1995).

The ﬁeld has experienced a renewed interest as a result of the development of
the experimental technique known as COLTRIMS (cold-target recoil-ion momentum
spectroscopy) (Moshammer et al 1994). With COLTRIMS, the projectile’s tiny
scattering angle can be obtained indirectly by measuring the ionized electron and recoil
ion momenta. Fully diﬀerential cross sections (FDCS) for ion impact ionization can be
measured now and this constitute a challenging ground for existing theories (Foster et
al 2004).

The ﬁrst measurements of the FDCS, for various momentum transfers and ejected-
electron energies, were reported in 2001 by Schulz et al for single ionization of helium by
100 MeV amu−1 C6+. Theoretical results for this process were made later by Madison et
al 2002, using several approximation schemes. They obtained reasonable good agreement
between experiment and theory in the scattering plane for intermediate momentum
transfer, but the theories used was not able to reproduce the measurements for large
values of momentum transfer and out of scattering plane.

Subsequently, experiments with other projectiles and energy ranges have been
performed. Fischer et al (2003) have reported absolute experimental measurements
for 2 MeV amu−1 C6+ single ionization of helium in the scattering plane for various
momentum transfers and ejected-electron energies. Foster et al (2004) have presented
3DW–EIS results for the single ionization of helium by 3.6 MeV amu−1 Au24+ and
Au53+ ions. The 3DW–EIS model is a modiﬁed version of the CDW–EIS approximation
and, although the authors found good agreement with 2 MeV amu−1 C6+ data, the
theory did not yield a signiﬁcant improvement for higher charged ions. Theoretical

results calculated using a CDW–EIS model exhibited diﬀerences between experiment
and theory on an absolute scale for emission in the scattering plane, deﬁned by the
plane containing the initial and ﬁnal projectile momenta. Their calculations were made
using a post version of the CDW–EIS theory and an active electron approximation
with hydrogenic wavefunctions for the initial and ﬁnal electron states.
Indeed, the
simplest description for the He bound initial state is to assume it has one ‘active’ and
one ‘passive’ electron and that the ‘active’ electron can be described as moving in the
eﬀective Coulomb ﬁeld of the atomic core with an eﬀective charge chosen either: (a) to
reproduce the ionization energy or (b) so that the continuum wave is orthogonal to the
initial state.

A more sophisticated description involves the use of full numerical Hartree–Fock
wave functions for both initial and ﬁnal states of the active electron (Guly´as et al 1995,
Guly´as and Fainstein 1998, Foster et al 2004). Hartree–Fock description, however, does
not include proper angular correlations in the initial state, and for large perturbations,
there might be the chance that the projectile interacts with more than one electron in
a single event. An explicit two-electron description, i.e., a full-blown four-body theory
for the collision process might be necessary in that case. We have shown that by using
the prior version of CDW–EIS together with an appropriate Roothan–Hartree–Fock
description of the initial state and an eﬀective charge coulomb wave function for the
target - electron continuum, we get similar results to those obtained by using numerical
Hartree–Fock wave functions (Ciappina et al 2004), for ion impact helium ionization
DDCSs.

The aim of this paper is to present post and prior CDW–EIS calculations with
internuclear interaction between the projectile and the target (N–N interaction) taken
into account for ion helium single ionization FDCSs at diﬀerent perturbation regimes.
Atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise stated.

2. Theories

We regard He single ionization as a single electron process and assume that (i) the
initial state for the ‘active’ electron is described by a semi-analytical Rothan–Hartree–
Fock scheme using a 5 parameters wave function (Clemente and Roetti 1974) and (ii)
in the ﬁnal state the ‘active’ target electron moves in the combined Coulomb ﬁeld of
the target core with an eﬀective charge Zef f = 1.6875. The electron-projectile relative
motion are represented in a CDW–EIS approach, i.e. one eikonal phase in the entrance
channel and a pure Coulomb distortion in the ﬁnal one. N–N interaction is treated as a
pure Coulomb interaction between the projectile with a charge ZP and the true target
core charge, ZT = 1.

N–N interaction is taken into account in the transition amplitude aif (ρ), in the usual
semi-classical or eikonal approximation, through its multiplication by a phase factor
(McCarroll and Salin 1978), which for pure coulomb internuclear interaction results in

(Crothers and McCann 1983)

a′
if (ρ) = i(ρv)2iνaif (ρ)

were ν = ZP ZT /v, v is the velocity of the impinging projectile and ρ is the impact
parameter (ρ · v = 0). aif (ρ)
is the transition amplitude with (without)
internuclear interaction. Using two-dimensional Fourier transforms we have for the
transition amplitude elements,CDW–EIS transition matrix can be written alternatively
as a function of the momentum transfer:

We solve the integral over impact parameter analytically to obtain:

T ′
if (η) = ν

iv2iν(2π)−iν
24π3

Z

dη′ Tif (η′) |η − η′|−2(1+iν)

The remaining integral in (3) is evaluated numerically with an adaptive integration
scheme. This approximation is valid as long as (i) the projectile suﬀers very small
deﬂections in the collision and (ii) the velocity of the recoil ion remains small compared
to that of the emitted electron.

where Ne is the number of electrons in the atomic shell, µ is the reduced mass of the
projectile-target subsystem, Ki (Kf ) is the magnitude of the incident particle initial
(ﬁnal) momentum. The ejected-electron’s energy and momentum are given by Ek and
k respectively. The solid angles dΩK and dΩk represent the direction of scattering
of the projectile and the ionized electron, respectively. We use non-orthogonal Jacobi
coordinates (rP , rT ) to outline the collision process. These coordinates are the position
of the active electron with respect to the projectile (rP ) and to the target ion (rT )
respectively. Also the coordinate RT is needed, that represents the position of the
incoming projectile with respect to the center of mass of the subsystem e-T. If we
neglect terms of order 1/MT and 1/MP , where MT is the mass of the target ion nucleus
and MP is the corresponding to the incident heavy ion, we can write RT = rT − rP .

We have replaced the transition matrix in the post and prior schemes (equations
(4) and (5)) in the deﬁnition of FDCS (16) and we have applied it to several single
ionization processes.

3. Results

We have performed calculations for diﬀerent projectiles, spanning a large range of
perturbation strengths as measured by charge to velocity ratio η = ZP /v.
In ﬁgure
1 we present results for 100 Mev amu−1 C6+ (Schulz et al 2001) single ionization of
Helium calculated in prior CDW–EIS, for diﬀerent values of electron emission energy
(Ee) and momentum transfer (q = Ki − Kf ). Calculations are in very good agreement
with available experimental results.

In ﬁgure 2 we layout results for other theories applied to the same process for
an intermediate value of electron energy and momentum transfer. We see that prior
CDW–EIS gives the best results. Even when η = 0.1 both FBA and post CDW–EIS
fail to accurately describe the experimental results, although they broadly reproduce
the angular distribution.

Figures 3 and 4 show results for 3.6 MeV amu−1 Au24+ impact ionization of He
(Fischer et al 2003), calculated in prior and post CDW–EIS. For Ee = 4.0 eV, results
for prior version are in reasonable agreement with experiment, However both theories
fail to correctly reproduce the strong forward emission peak, which is due to the strong
projectile electron post collisional interaction (PCI). Trend is similar for Ee = 10.0 eV,
(Figure 4) where we see a better performance in prior version calculations, in particular
in the prediction of the direct peak position. Note that no renormalization factor is
included in these calculations.

In ﬁgures 5 and 6 we show prior and post CDW–EIS calculations for 3.6 MeV amu−1
Au53+ impact ionization of He. Even when we are stretching the validity range of the
perturbative treatment a bit too much (η ≈ 2, 4.4 for Au24+ and Au53+ projectiles
respectively), angular structure with only one strong peak is correctly predicted in
prior version while post version of the theory predicts two distinct direct and recoil
peak. However the position of the peak is not correctly given in prior version, again
because the theory underestimates the strong PCI between the impinging ion and the
ejected electron, which shifts the emission towards the forward direction. Both versions
including N-N interaction fail to yield the correct order of magnitude of experimental
data. Large projectile charges are likely to induce quite a large polarization in the target.
Eﬀective charges both for residual target-electron and N–N interactions are probably
not the same than for lower charged projectiles, and it is indeed very probable that the
eﬀective charge approach is not a good approximation here. Model potentials taking
into account polarization eﬀects need to be considered for the target, at least in the exit
channel, but most probably in both initial and ﬁnal states.

4. Conclusions

We have performed FDCSs calculations for highly charged ion impact ionization of
Helium. We employed prior and post versions of CDW–EIS theories taken into account
N–N interaction but otherwise using as simple an approach for electronic wave functions
as possible. Indeed, use of prior version helps us to avoid the need of more precise wave
functions for the initial or ﬁnal electronic state. We found reasonably good agreement
with experimental data, even for projectile charges for which the system is arguably
outside the range of validity of a perturbative theory.

We see that for emission in the collision plane, three body dynamics seems to be
enough to explain most of the structures observed for low energy emission and low
projectile charge. For Au24+ and Au53+ projectiles the larger emission in the forward
direction is not well reproduced by the theory but, as said before, those cases are outside
the range where perturbative treatments are known to be valid. However, if the eﬀect
of target polarization in the entrance channel and the inclusion of higher orders in the
exit channel distortions, are taken into account, perturbation based calculations could
probably be brought closer to experimental results.

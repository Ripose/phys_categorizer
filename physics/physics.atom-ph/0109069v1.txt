We present ﬁrst indications of sympathetic cooling between two neutral trapped
atomic species. Lithium and cesium atoms are simultaneously stored in an optical
dipole trap formed by the focus of a CO2 laser, and allowed to interact for a given
period of time. The temperature of the lithium gas is found to decrease when
in thermal contact with cold cesium. The timescale of thermalization yields an
estimate for the Li-Cs cross-section.

Mixtures of atomic gases enrich the ﬁeld of physics with ultracold gases
by making many interesting phenomena available for experimental study. A
prime example is the exchange of thermal energy between diﬀerent compo-
nents in the mixture. This cross-thermalization can be used for determining
inter-species collision cross-sections, and, more importantly, for sympathetic
cooling. The process of sympathetic cooling, where the gas of interest is
cooled through thermalization with a coolant gas, is especially advantageous
if the cooled gas (Li in our case) is hard to cool by other methods, while
the coolant gas (Cs) allows for eﬃcient laser cooling. The Li can only be
optically cooled to approximately the Doppler temperature of 0.14 mK, and
evaporative cooling of this atom in its stable F = 1 ground state is extremely
diﬃcult due to its anomalously low scattering length 1. Cesium, on the other
hand, allows sub-Doppler temperatures (< 3 µK in free space) to be reached
by simple polarization-gradient cooling. This opens the perspective of reach-
ing a stable Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Li in the F = 1 state (as in
the experiment by Schreck et al. 1) without evaporative cooling.

Our apparatus is described in detail in a previous paper 2. The thermal-
ization experiments take place in an optical dipole trap, which is based on a
CO2 laser emitting light at 10.6 µm. As the laser frequency is detuned far
below any optical resonances of the atoms, this trap is referred to as a quasi-
electrostatic trap (QUEST) 3. Our QUEST employs a 140 W laser beam
which is focused to a beam waist of 90 µm. This yields a depth of 0.4 mK
for Li and 1.0 mK for Cs. The axial and radial oscillation frequencies for Cs

atoms are 18 and 800 Hz, respectively, the corresponding frequencies for Li
are higher by a factor 2.8 due to the diﬀerence in mass and polarizability.

The atoms are loaded into the QUEST from a combined magneto-optical
trap (MOT) 4. We load up to 106 Cs atoms, at a temperature of ∼ 30 µK
and up to 105 Li atoms, which have a thermal energy of the order of the trap
depth.

In a typical experiment, we trap a mixed sample and let the atoms interact
for a variable time, and then turn oﬀ the QUEST. We subsequently measure
the temperature and density of the Cs gas by absorption imaging (projection
of the shadow of the gas cloud on a camera). The Li particle number is mea-
sured by ﬂuorescence measurements after recapture in the MOT. The optical
density of the Li gas is insuﬃcient to use absorption imaging, therefore the
temperature of the Li cannot be determined directly. The evolution of the
number of atoms in the trap is shown in Fig. 1. When stored separately,
both Li and Cs gases decay due to rest gas collisions in 125 and 150 s, re-

spectively. There is no indication of evaporation in either case: Cs does not
evaporate as its temperature is far below the trap depth. Li evaporation is
energetically possible but the cross section for Li-Li collisions is so small that
the characteristic timescale is > 1000 s.

When the gases are stored simultaneously, the Li atom number shows
a non-exponential initial behavior followed by an approximately exponential
decay with a characteristic time of 35 s, which is much faster than the 125 s rest
gas induced decay. We interpret this as evaporation due to elastic collisions
with the Cs. From the evolution of the particle number we can determine
inelastic and elastic heteronuclear collision rates 2. However, the clearest
signature of sympathetic cooling, reduction of the temperature of the cooled
gas, cannot be obtained this way.

To determine the lithium temperature change due to sympathetic cooling,
we have performed release-and-recapture measurements, in a manner analo-
gous to experiments by O’Hara et al. 5. In this type of measurement, the
QUEST is turned oﬀ and the atoms are released in free space for a short time.

After a free expansion time of up to 2 ms the QUEST is turned on again. The
fraction of Li atoms that were recaptured in the QUEST is a measure of the
Li temperature, since slow atoms take a longer time to leave the trapping
region. A more quantitative analysis of these release-recapture measurements
is being performed and will be published elsewhere.

In ﬁgure 2 release-recapture thermometry is demonstrated on two diﬀerent
Li samples: one which has been loaded from the MOT and stored in the
QUEST for a short time without Cs, and one which has been stored together
with a cold Cs sample for 15 s. The ﬁgure clearly shows that in the latter
case more atoms are recaptured at long times, i.e., a larger number of slow
atoms is present. This indicates that the lithium is cooled sympathetically by
the laser cooled cesium atoms.

The timescale of thermalization can be estimated from the inset in Fig. 2,
where a single point from the release-recapture curve was measured for dif-
ferent interaction times. A thermalization timescale of roughly 3 seconds can
be estimated. From a rate equation model 2 one estimates elastic scattering
cross-section of σCsLi ∼ 3 × 10−12 cm2 which is in satisfactory agreement with
the earlier estimate we obtained from evaporation measurements 2. Note that
the absolute number of slow atoms increases during thermalization, indicating
an increasing phase space density.

Further eﬀorts will concentrate on lowering the temperature of the coolant
gas and increasing the number of trapped Li atoms, thereby increasing the
degeneracy parameter. By repeated pulsed optical cooling one can extract
the entropy that the Li transfers to the Cs, thereby providing a truly lossless
cooling mechanism towards BEC of Li. For a sample of 106 Li atoms, the
BEC transition temperature is ∼ 3 µK in our trap.

An asymptotic theory of atom scattering by large amplitude periodic potentials is developed in
the Raman-Nath approximation. The atom grating proﬁle arising after scattering is evaluated in the
Fresnel zone for triangular, sinusoidal, magneto-optical, and bichromatic ﬁeld potentials. It is shown
that, owing to the scattering in these potentials, two groups of momentum states are produced rather
than two distinct momentum components. The corresponding spatial density proﬁle is calculated
and found to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from a pure sinusoid.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interaction of atoms with a spatially varying optical
ﬁeld can lead to a spatial modulation of the atomic den-
sity. For example, when a collimated atomic beam propa-
gating along the x axis passes through a resonant, stand-
ing wave ﬁeld directed along the z axis, it acquires trans-
verse momentum components 2n¯hk and (2n + 1) ¯hk for
the atomic ground and excited states, respectively, where
k is the ﬁeld propagation constant and n is an integer In-
terference between these momentum states [1] results in
a periodic modulation of the atom density with period
d = λ/2, where λ = 2π/k. This splitting of the atomic
wave function (resonant Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect [2]) and the
density modulation have been observed in a beam of Na
[3] and Ar [4] atoms, respectively. Atom gratings can be
deposited on substrates and have potential applications
as diﬀraction gratings for soft x-rays.

The grating density proﬁle ρ (z) produced by this tech-
nique contains an inﬁnite number of Fourier harmonics
having periods λ/2n and amplitudes ρn. For the grating
proﬁle to be approximately sinusoidal, then at most a few
ρn contribute in the Fourier sum. On the other hand, the
”sharp” grating that can be produced by atom focusing
using strong standing wave ﬁelds [5,6] consists of a large
number of Fourier components,

Sharp gratings have important lithographic applications,

quence, it is most eﬃcient to scatter x-rays from a sinu-

is nonvanishing [n = 1 in Eq. (2)] . To increase the an-
gle and resolution of scattering one needs a high order
sinusoidal grating having period

d = λ/2¯n,

(3)

where ¯n > 1. Several techniques have been proposed to
produce such high order gratings. One can distinguished
two groups of methods, harmonic suppression (HS) and
large angle beam splitters (LABS) . In HS, one arrives
at a periodicity (3) as a result of suppressing all Fourier
components in the atom wave function that are not a
multiple of ¯n. Included in the HS group are methods that
employ photon echoes [7], multicolor ﬁelds [8], high order
Bragg scattering [9], and Fourier optics techniques [10],
methods which are summarized below.

An appropriate echo geometry for HS involves atoms
that pass through two standing wave ﬁelds, spatially sep-
arated by a distance L (or atoms that are subjected to
two temporally separated standing wave ﬁeld pulses). At
distances L′ = n
¯n L (n′ > ¯n, where n′ and ¯n are integers
having no common factors), the atomic density contains
only those Fourier components having n that is a mul-
tiple of ¯n. The other components are suppressed if the
atom beam has a transverse velocity width δθ > λ/L [7].
A λ
period grating (¯n = 2) has been observed using this
method on 85Rb atoms cooled in a MOT and subjected
to the 2 time-separated standing wave ﬁeld pulses [11]. In
the multicolor ﬁeld technique [8], atoms interact during
time τ with a traveling wave ﬁeld having frequency Ω and
two counterpropagating traveling wave ﬁelds having fre-
1 and the detunings
δjτ
quencies Ω+δ1 and Ω+δ2. If
|
are chosen such as n1δ1 + n2δ2 = 0, then a grating having
period λ/2¯n is produced, with ¯n = n1 + n2. In contrast
to the echo-technique, the multicolor ﬁeld method allows
one to obtain near-unity contrast for arbitrary ¯n. For
Bragg scattering, a proper choice of the angle between
the atomic beam and the ﬁeld propagation direction or,
alternatively, a proper choice of atom-ﬁeld detunings [12],
leads to situations where low spatial harmonics are sup-
pressed. A λ
period grating has been obtained using
this technique [9].
In the Fourier optics technique one
focuses atoms transmitted through a standing wave ﬁeld

using a long-focus lens. Diﬀerent harmonics of the atomic
wave function are focused at the diﬀerent positions. Us-
ing spatial ﬁltering, one can suppress all harmonics ex-
cept two, whose interference leads to the grating of the
desirable period. In this way one achieves 100% contrast
pure sinusoidal gratings, but the amplitude of the grat-
ings decreases with increasing grating order.

In the past several years, a number of methods have
been proposed for using counterpropagating optical ﬁelds
to create potentials that simulate a V-potential (6).
Atom scattering oﬀ these ﬁelds involves multiphoton pro-
cesses that result in a transfer of momentum between the
counterpropagating ﬁeld modes. The eﬀective potential
U (z, t) corresponding to these processes is a function of
bi-linear products of the counterpropagating ﬁeld am-
plitudes. As a consequence, U (z, t) has period λ/2 as
a function of z. One might expect that a so-called tri-
angular potential, a periodic potential coinciding with a
V-potential within a period,

should produce gratings similar to the sinusoidal grat-
ing (8) produced by the V-potential. Based on this idea
several schemes for LABS have been proposed.

The simplest example of such a beam splitter is the
strong standing wave ﬁeld ﬁrst considered in [2]. After
adiabatic elimination of the internal degrees of freedom,
one ﬁnds a sinusoidal potential having period λ
2 . Asymp-
totically, for a large potential amplitude, the main con-
tribution to the scattering arises from the area around
points z0 where the potential slope is maximum; in this
region the potential is approximately linear. The momen-
tum an atom acquires after scattering near such points is

An alternative method which produces a potential that
more closely approximates (9) is the magneto-optical ﬁeld
geometry [13], in which resonant cross-polarized counter-
propagating ﬁelds drive a ground-to-excited state transi-
tion, J = 0
J = 1, where J is the atomic angular mo-
mentum. A magnetic ﬁeld directed along the z axis that
splits the excited state Zeeman sublevels is also applied.
A regime has been found where the magneto-optical po-
tential is extremely close to the triangular potential (9).
The nonlinearity near z = z0 is small compared with that
associated with the standing wave potential. Magneto-
optical forces have been used to deﬂect an atomic beam
[13] and to split an atomic beam into two momenta com-
ponents localized near values p =
21¯hk [¯n = 21 in Eq.
(4)] [14]. Atom scattering from a magneto-optical po-
tential is considered in [15–17], while the force acting on
atoms is calculated in [18]. Instead of using a magnetic
ﬁeld one can detune standing waves symmetrically with
respect to the atomic transition frequency [19].

±

Another way of creating a potential similar to the tri-
angular one is to use a bichromatic ﬁeld [20], in which
atoms scatter from two standing wave ﬁelds, shifted from
one another with respect to their frequencies, and spa-
tial and temporal phases. Forces resulting from this ﬁeld
have been observed in [21,22]. A remarkable property of
these forces (large magnitude in comparison with radi-
ation forces, insensitivity to atomic velocity) allows for
fast atomic beam deceleration [23] and for large angle
deﬂections [24]. The triangular potential associated with
a bichromatic ﬁeld was predicted in [25], and scattering
oﬀ this ﬁeld has been observed [26] and studied for two-
level [27,26] and three level atoms [28–31]. Moreover, it
has been shown [32] that atoms can be scattered with
unit probability with a given change of momentum if a
”counterintuitive pulse sequence” is used.

2

Despite the similarity between the triangular poten-
tial (9) and V-potential (6), there is an important diﬀer-
ence. Owing to the intrinsic λ/2 periodicity, atoms scat-
ter in the potential (9) not only into states p =
¯n¯hk but
±
also into states having p =

±
Thus, at best, the potential (9) can produce two groups
¯n¯hk. As such the resulting
of momenta centered at p =

pattern deviates from that of a true V-potential. The
additional momentum states produce deviations from an
ideal sinusoidal atom grating (5) by producing additional
Fourier components,

In this article we provide a detailed calculation of
the spatial gratings produced by LABS, using analyti-
cal asymptotic and numerical calculations. We consider
only the Fresnel regime when all scattered atomic beams
overlap with one another. An asymptotic expression for
the atomic wave function in momentum space is derived
in the next Section and the atomic density proﬁle is cal-
culated in Sec. 3. Results are summarized and discussed
in Sec. 4. In the Appendix, we consider atom gratings
produced by the triangular potential (9).

produces atom gratings that are not pure, high order
gratings; their overall periodicity is still λ/2. Gratings
arising in HS also contain extra terms (10), but one is
guaranteed that aν ≪
a0 if ν is not a multiple of ¯n. As
a result, atom gratings produced by HS closely approxi-
mate high order λ

that oscillates slightly with period λ/2 around a constant
value.

Scattering into a range of momentum components oc-
curs even for the triangular potential. For potentials
which approximate the triangular potential (standing
wave, magneto-optical scheme, bichromatic ﬁeld), addi-
tional features arise owing to the nonlinearities in these
potentials. It turns out that the width ∆n for these po-
tentials increases with increasing ¯n. If one tries to de-
crease the grating period by increasing ¯n, there is a corre-
sponding deterioration of the degree to which the grating

II. ATOM WAVE FUNCTION

In this section, we calculate the atomic response to a
standing wave ﬁeld pulse, a magneto-optical ﬁeld pulse
and a bichromatic ﬁeld pulse, all in the Raman-Nath ap-
proximation. For an atomic beam, the pulsed interaction
occurs in the atom rest frame.

A. Standing wave.

If initially an atom is in the zero momentum state, then the Fourier components

determine the amplitudes for scattering into momentum states p = 2n¯hk, which we refer to as scattering into state n.

In the asymptotic limit

the main contribution to the integral (16) arises from points of stationary phase, z = z0. These contributions are
maximal if the second derivative of the phase also vanishes at z = z0. This means that the dominant contribution to
scattering into state n occurs for n

the article [27] by a numerical solution of the Shr¨odinger
equation. We suppose that diﬀerences arise owing to the
fact that a rectangular pulse proﬁle was used in [27]; such
a pulse does not satisfy our adiabaticity requirements.

III. ATOM GRATING PROFILE

The LABS split an initial p = 0 state into two groups
of states having momenta close to p =
2n0¯hk. It is
of interest to compare the matter gratings generated by
these LABS in the Fresnel scattering zone with those of
an ideal beam splitter. An ideal beam splitter produces
purely sinusoidal gratings having period

±

di = λ/4n0.

At a time t after scattering from a potential having
period λ/2, each momentum state’s amplitude evolves
, where ω2k = 2¯hk2/m is a recoil
as ψn exp

Asymptotic calculation of the atomic density proﬁle is
simplest for a triangular potential (9) (see Appendix).
One ﬁnds in that case that the grating proﬁles are not
those of an ideal beam splitter. If one wishes to carry
out analogous solutions for the potentials considered in
Sec. II, purely numerical calculations are needed. Such
calculations are not given in this paper.

We are left with the problem of evaluating Eq. (45)
in some asymptotic limit. Immediately we run into two
problems: (1) Owing to the nonlinearities in the poten-
tials, one cannot simply use the asymptotic expression
for the Fourier components (19) since, when these ex-
pressions are substituted into Eq. (45), one ﬁnds that
the constraint,

is violated. Equation (46) follows from Eq.
ρ (z, t) dz/λ = 1. If one restricts the
the fact that 2
calcu-
summation to values n
R
lated using Eq. (45) diverges as
. This
example demonstrates that an alternative technique is
needed to calculate the atomic density in the asymptotic
limit, which allows one to include contributions from all
momentum states. (2) Potentials having smooth rather
than triangular extrema lead to the atom focusing [5,6]
1/θω2k [36], i. e. to a sharp λ
2 -period grat-
at a time t
ing having little in common with a sinusoidal grating.
There is no simple way to predict the times for which
this density pattern is transformed into one that might
resemble that of the triangular potential. Rather than
looking for such times numerically, we consider an alter-
native approach for obtaining the grating proﬁle, valid
for large times.

∼

To this point we assumed implicitly that we were deal-
ing with a monovelocity atomic beam. The time t is
related to the observation plane at a distance x from the
interaction zone, by t = x/u, where u is the atom ve-
locity along the x-axis.
In principle, for a LABS one
needs a monovelocity beam, since the pulse area θ and
(therefore) the angle of scattering (n0) depends on u like
1/u; however, one can neglect this dependence for a small
width of the velocity distribution, ∆u
u. Although we
u, it is assumed that ∆u is nonvanishing
require ∆u

Gratings of this type have been observed recently in the

riod of the grating proﬁle (0 < z < λ/4) , one arrives [38]

Lacking an analytical expression for the potential pro-

analytical asymptotic expression for the grating proﬁle.
On the other hand, it is possible to evaluate Eqs. (50a)
numerically. In Fig. 6 the proﬁle is shown for n0 = 20π/3

IV. DISCUSSION

Asymptotic expressions in the limit of large-angle scat-
tering have been obtained for the atomic wave function
and grating proﬁle after scattering from a periodic trian-
gular potential (see Appendix) and from potentials which
approximate this triangular potential. The potentials are
chosen [13,25] with the goal of producing two and only
two ﬁnal state momenta

p =

2n0¯hk,

±

(69)

with (n0
1) . In turn, interference between these mo-
menta components in the Fresnel scattering region lead

≫

±

In practice, it is impossible to produce only two ﬁ-
nal state momenta with periodic potentials. At best,
one ﬁnds scattering into two groups of states centered
around p =
2n0¯hk. Owing to the range of momenta in
each group, none of the potentials can generate the ideal
grating proﬁle (70). For the potentials considered in this
work, the width of the momentum groups scales asymp-
totically as n
[see Eqs. (22, 36, 43)]. If one’s goal is to
creates a higher order sinusoidal grating, then one needs
to increase the angle of splitting, i. e. the parameter n0.
However, by increasing n0 one broadens the width of the
momentum groups, and diminishes degree to which the
grating proﬁle approximates a pure sinusoidal grating.

In the limit of strong ﬁelds and large scattering angles,
we developed asymptotic techniques for evaluating the
atomic wave function and density. One might think that
a quasiclassical or WKB method could be used in this
limit, but the linear nature of the potential invalidates
such an approach in the region of maximum scattering.
Instead, the method of stationary phase was used to ob-
tain asymptotic expressions for the wave function. The
results depend solely on the ﬁrst and third derivatives of
the potential at the point of maximum slope. For all but
the triangular potential, however, these asymptotic ex-
pressions cannot be used in the expressions for the atomic
density since they do not produce a convergent result.

Only for the triangular potential does the asymptotic
expression for the Fourier amplitudes converge rapidly
enough as a function of Fourier index n to allow one to
calculate the atomic density using these asymptotic for-
mulas. The periodic triangular potential is analyzed in
the Appendix. The scattered signal is a periodic function
of time with period t0 = T /2n0, where T = 2π/ω2k is the
Talbot time (recall that time t is related to the distance
x following the atom-ﬁeld interaction zone by t = x/u,
where u is the longitudinal velocity). In a given scatter-
ing plane following the atom-ﬁeld interaction, the atom
density consists of three distinct spatial regions, one of
the form (70) but with twice as large an amplitude, one
with ρ (z) = 1, and one with ρ (z) = 0. Examples of these
proﬁles are shown in Fig. 7 in the Appendix.

For the standing wave, magneto-optical, and bichro-
matic ﬁeld potentials, the atomic density was calculated
u
for scattering distances x
is the range of longitudinal velocities [38]. The density is
a periodic function of z having period λ/4.

For the standing wave potential one can distinguish
regions about z = nλ/4 (n is an arbitrary integer) of ex-
tent λ/n0 where the density has a sharp maximum [see
Eq. (54a)] of order unity. With the exception of these
regions the density is an oscillating function of z with am-
plitude of order n−1/2
and spatially inhomogeneous pe-

riod (55). The period becomes inﬁnite at z =
which implies that, near these points, the proﬁle is ﬂat.
All these features are seen in Fig. 3, where the grating
proﬁle is plotted for n0 = 2 and n0 = 20π/3. The last
case corresponds to the value chosen in [15] for numeri-
cal calculations. It is surprising that the analysis of the
scattering in terms of two distinct spatial intervals seems
1
to be valid even for n0 = 2, when the condition n0
is not satisﬁed.

proﬁle produced by the magneto-optical ﬁeld is shown in
the Fig. 4. For a moderate value n0 = 2, the dependence
(67c) associated with region III is a poor approximation
to the proﬁle; however, one can see from Fig. 4 that
it is not necessary to use the expression for region III.
Regions I and II overlap with region III and with each
other, and Eqs. (67b, 67a) provide a good approximation
to the proﬁle for all z.

The grating proﬁle for the bichromatic potential is

shown in Fig. 6 for n0 = 20π/3.

In summary, we have asymptotic expressions for the
momentum distribution and calculated the grating pro-
ﬁle for several classes of optical beam splitters. While
the momentum distribution resulting from these beam
splitters can approach that of an ideal beam splitter, the
associated grating proﬁles do not closely approximate a
pure sinusoidal pattern.

APPENDIX A: APPENDIX - TRIANGULAR POTENTIAL.

It is instructive to consider scattering by the ideal periodic triangular potential (9). This potential diﬀers from
those considered in the text in that the second derivative in each half-period of the potential vanishes identically. The

[37] The distance x is always conﬁned to the Fresnel scatter-
ing zone, which for a beam of diameter b requires xφ ≪ b,
where φ ∼ n0¯hk/M u is the scattering angle.

[40] This condition could be too strong. For example in the
triangular potential the averaged proﬁle arises for dis-
tances x ≫ t0u2/∆u , which are 2n0 times smaller than
those given by Eq. (47).

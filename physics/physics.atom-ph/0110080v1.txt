Abstract. A quasi classical approximation to quantum mechanical scattering
in the Møller formalism is developed. While keeping the numerical advantage
of a standard Classical–Trajectory–Monte–Carlo calculation, our approach is
no longer restricted to use stationary initial distributions. This allows one to
improve the results by using better suited initial phase space distributions than the
microcanonical one and to gain insight into the collision mechanism by studying
the inﬂuence of diﬀerent initial distributions on the cross section. A comprehensive
account of results for single, double and triple diﬀerential cross sections for atomic
hydrogen will be given, in comparison with experiment and other theories.

1. Introduction

Electron impact ionization of hydrogen probes the scattering properties of three
charged particles without any inﬂuence from passive core electrons or other
perturbations. For this reason it has served as a benchmark system to understand
non–separable Coulomb collision dynamics for a long time which is reﬂected in
the enormous amount of literature and the remarkable theoretical and experimental
success in handling these collisions. A milestone were the experiments by Ehrhardt
and his group obtaining fully diﬀerential cross sections on an absolute scale [1, 2].
Theoretically, many diﬀerent approximate treatments have reached increasingly better
agreement with the experiment [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and fully numerical calculations, ﬁrst
available for the total cross section [8], have reached a break-through recently [9] for
fully diﬀerential cross sections and are now producing results for many impact energies
and geometries [10, 11, 12].

Our goal with the formulation of a quasiclassical theory of electron impact
ionization is to open the way for scattering of more than three particles as already done
experimentally with double ionization by electron impact [13, 14]. Furthermore, we
aim at a description which allows for a calculation of the entire scattering information
(i.e. the whole accessible parameter space in ﬁnal angles and energies) at once. This
is motivated by similar experimental capabilities made possible by the COLTRIMS
technique which allows for a new representation of scattering data (see e.g. [15, 16]).
Clearly, with the present computational and theoretical tools this is not possible
for four our more particles. One has to fall back to quasiclassical approximations
based on the rather successful CTMC method [17]. As will be explained later, there

is a an obstacle deeply rooted in classical mechanics which has hindered CTMC to be
extended to more than one active target electron. One goal of our work is to overcome
In the present paper we have restricted ourselves to three particles,
this obstacle.
namely electron impact ionization of hydrogen, in order to see where the strengths
and weaknesses of our quasiclassical approach lie. Also, we would like to make contact
with the original CTMC method by deriving it as a limiting case of our approach.

Combining the classical treatment with quantum eﬀects has had a long history in
collision theory. Already shortly after Abrines and Percival introduced the “classical
trajectory Monte-Carlo” method where the target electron was represented by an
ensemble of Kepler orbits of ﬁxed energy (“microcanonical distribution”), alternative
descriptions were proposed, e.g., the Wigner transform of the quantum wave function
[18], “superpositions” of microcanonical distributions of diﬀerent energies [19, 20] or,
only recently, an “optimum classical description”, based on symmetry considerations
and phase space partitioning [21]. In an attempt to describe four-body systems helium
was modeled classically in an independent electron picture or the interaction between
the two bound electrons was switched oﬀ temporarily to prevent autoionization (see,
e.g. [22, 23, 24]). All these attempts had in common, that they started from the purely
classical model and tried to extend it by implementing quantum elements (see, e.g.
[25, 26]). Such strategies have limited predictive power, as parameters or switch-on
times must be ﬁtted to reproduce particular cross sections.

As brieﬂy reported in [27] we propose an alterative approach: we start from
the (exact) time-dependent quantum formulation, translate it to phase space by
means of the Wigner formalism and ﬁnally approximate this description classically
by setting ¯h = 0. Hence, we can approximate quantum collisions in a controlled way.
Furthermore, we gain additional freedom for the description of the target electron.
This leads to an improved agreement of quasiclassical diﬀerential cross sections with
the experiment and, even more important, opens the way to incorporate multi-electron
targets without any further approximation to the dynamical description.

The paper is organized as follows:

the derivation of the “quasiclassical”
approximation will be given in section 2, in section 3 we will characterize the four
initial state distributions we use for the hydrogen target; the results will be presented
and discussed in section 4. The last section contains a conclusion and an outlook to
multi-electron targets.

2. The quasiclassical modeling of a collision

We divide the complete ionization process into three parts: setting up the initial state,
propagating this initial phase space distribution and ﬁnally extracting cross sections
from the scattered initial distribution. To arrive at a consistent formulation each
part is treated in the same way by translation into the Wigner picture of quantum
mechanics [28]. The classical approximation is subsequently achieved by setting ¯h = 0
[29].

2.1. Initial distribution

We construct the initial distribution w(~p, ~q) from the ¯h = 0 limit of the Wigner
distribution. This distribution is discretized and the individual mesh points in
phase space then represent initial conditions for solving classical equations of motion.
However, the resulting paths are not those of real electrons in real space, rather they

A quasi classical approach to electron impact ionization

3

should be interpreted as the evolution of a discretized phase space density which may
have negative parts as well (e.g., for the Wigner distribution). These parts simply
contribute to the cross sections with their negative weight, there is no need to argue
about “negative probabilities” which clearly demonstrates the advantage of starting
with a quantum formulation.

However, naively incorporating such a generalized initial phase space distribution
in general
w(~p, ~q) into the usual classical framework leads to other diﬃculties [18]:
w(~p, ~q) will not be stationary under the classical propagation, i.e., its Poisson bracket
with the Hamiltonian of the unperturbed target does not vanish, {H i
0, w} 6= 0. Hence,
the initial target distribution will look very diﬀerent at the time the projectile has
reached the target and the collision actually happens.

Another problem is even more severe: when using a classical phase space
distribution derived from a quantum wave function to select initial values for a classical
trajectory calculation, most of these initial values do not have the energy of the
hydrogen ground state, but they start from a range of energies around the binding
energy. Consequently, when extracting cross sections, it is not suﬃcient any more to
only test the ﬁnal energy of one of the electrons, as the other electron’s ﬁnal energy
can not be calculated as the diﬀerence to the mean total energy.
In a total cross
section this energy spread might be neglected, but cross sections diﬀerential in energy
would either be convoluted with the initial energy spread or, if the ﬁnal energy of both
continuum electrons is added up for a speciﬁc trajectory, only trajectories with those
initial conditions from the initial distribution contribute which initially started on the
energy shell. We will explicitly address this problem, which has not been mentioned
in previous calculations using non–microcanonical initial distributions [18, 19, 20].

Next, we will propose a formulation of the propagation and the extraction of the
cross section that can deal with the diﬃculties arising from general initial distributions.

2.2. Propagation

Quantum mechanical time dependent scattering is described by calculating the
transition amplitude between initial and ﬁnal state through the S–matrix, which is in
turn related to the T–matrix describing directly the cross section, see, e.g., [30],

where

Sf i = hf |Ω†

are the Møller operators. The meaning of Ω+, e.g.,
with U0(t) = exp[−iH i

projectile–target interaction and then forward under the full Hamiltonian with U (t).
If the initial and ﬁnal states are eigenstates of the asymptotic Hamiltonians H i
0 and
H f

0t] using the asymptotic initial Hamiltonian H i

0 , often a short version is used:

Sf i = lim
t→∞

hf |U (t)|ii.

By a Wigner transform the quantum time evolution operator U (t) can be directly
transformed with the help of the quantum Liouville operator Lq, which reduces to
the classical Liouville operator Lc in the limit ¯h → 0 [31]. The latter describes the
evolution of a phase space distribution w(~p, ~q, t) according to the Poisson bracket

in analogy to the quantum evolution of the density matrix ρ generated by the
commutator,

∂tρ = −i[H, ρ].

Hence, we could directly use the translation of (3) to classical mechanics via the
Liouville operator. In connection with the microcanonical initial state distribution
this is indeed equivalent to the CTMC formulation [32, 33].

However, (3) is insuﬃcient, if the distribution is not stationary under the initial
asymptotic propagation. Instead, one must use the complete form (1) of the scattering
operator S = Ω†
−Ω+. Correspondingly, the Møller operators are translated into a
classical propagation scheme, which “transforms” the initial non–stationary phase
space distribution wi(γ), where γ = (~p1, ~q1, ~p2, ~q2) is a point in the 12-dimensional
phase space, into the “scattered” result of the reaction wf (γ) at the same point in
time:

this propagation scheme a non–stationary initial distribution will spread when being
propagated backwards with the asymptotic Li
c. However, it will be refocused under the
following forward propagation with Lc. Hence, when the actual collision happens at
t ≈ 0 the original target distribution is restored, slightly polarized by the approaching
projectile.

n emerges from γi
0, then with H, and eventually with H f

The propagation now compensates for the non–stationarity of the initial
distribution, which means, that any arbitrary phase space description can be used
for the target, even classically unstable multi-electron targets like helium.

2.3. Extraction of cross sections

According to (1) the cross section is extracted from the overlap between the scattered
initial wave function S|ii and the asymptotic ﬁnal state |f i, which is an eigenstate of
H f
0 . For ionization we assume that |f i can be approximated by two free electrons.
However, before we come to the actual evaluation we have to formulate the cross
section such that it can make full use of the non–stationary initial phase space
distribution wi(~p1, ~q1), where “1” refers to the target electron. Without modiﬁcation
the total energy E of the ﬁnal state forces by energy conservation for each classical
trajectory only those parts of the initial phase space distribution to contribute to the
cross section which have the same total energy E (see above). However, this would
bring us essentially back to the microcanonical description. In order to make the entire
non–stationary initial state distribution “visible” to the collision process, we use the
energy transfer ∆E1 = Ef

as a diﬀerential measure. Of course, as long as the initial state is on the energy shell

wf (γf ) = Kwi(γi).

The cross section (9) is a generalization of the one derived, e.g., in [34], where
the initial target bound state was assumed to live on a torus,
i.e., wi(~p1, ~q1) =
δ(~I(~p1, ~q1) − ~I0) with a well deﬁned multidimensional action ~I0 and the initial project
state ﬁxes (~p2, ~q2), except for the impact parameter area dx2dy2. Note that the change
of variables from the momenta and positions for the scattered distribution wf to
scattering angles and energy transfer in (9) contains a constraint how a diﬀerential
phase space volume centered around its guiding trajectory contributes to the cross
section: only those phase space cells are relevant for ionization whose trajectory has the
correct energy transfer and positive energy after the change of variables. Trajectories
with correct energy transfer but ﬁnal negative energy (i.e., one electron is still bound)
do not contribute to the ionization cross section. Consequently, if one is interested in
the total ionization cross section only, (9) simpliﬁes to

Finally, we have to respect the Pauli principle for the two identical electrons. This
can be done in the initial or ﬁnal state. The Wigner transformed (anti)–symmetrized
asymptotic state wave function has two parts: the “classical” part, independent of ¯h,
where the indices of the two electrons are interchanged and an “interference term”.
In the limit ¯h → 0 the latter part oscillates inﬁnitely rapidly and its contribution to
the cross section (9) vanishes upon integration. In the actual calculation it is easier
to perform the remaining classical symmetrization in the ﬁnal state.

3. Initial target phase space distributions

In the previous section we have taken the theoretical eﬀort to formulate an
approximate scattering theory which goes beyond the classical approximation still
using classical trajectories as in CTMC. Our goal was to allow for non–stationary
initial target distributions in phase space as they occur if one translates the quantum
wave function into a phase space distribution. This translation, however, is not
unique and depends on the used correspondence rule as shown by Moyal [36], see
also [37, 38, 39].

Our main interest in this ﬁrst application of non–stationary distributions is not to
optimize the initial distribution but to learn how the collision dynamics is inﬂuenced
by diﬀerent aspects of initial distributions. For this purpose we have chosen four
prominent distributions for which we will compare the same collision processes. Apart
from the well known microcanonical distribution we have chosen Cohen’s ensemble,

A quasi classical approach to electron impact ionization

which is a superposition of microcanonical distributions [20].
In addition to these
more classical distributions we will implement the product distribution, the product
of the quantum mechanical density in momentum and coordinate space [39], and the
well known Wigner distribution [28].

All four distributions have the correct expectation value of the binding energy of

Eb = −0.5 a.u.¿ However, they have diﬀerent energy spreading, deﬁned as

.

(11)

¿From table 1 one sees that the Wigner and the product distribution have a rather
broad energy distribution. This is in general the price one must pay for phase space
distributions which resemble closely quantum wave functions. For later reference we
characterize very brieﬂy each distribution.

3.1. The Wigner distribution

From a wave function ψ(~r) one obtains the Wigner distribution by the reversible
transformation [28]

w(~p, ~q; t) =

d3s ei~p~s/¯hψ∗(~q + ~s/2, t) ψ(~q − ~s/2, t).

By construction the Wigner function reproduces the quantum probability densities in
coordinate and momentum space:

d3p w(~p, ~q) = |ψ(~q)|2

and

d3q w(~p, ~q) = |ψ(~p)|2 .

(13)

Z

Z

Note that the Wigner function depends on the angle between ~p and ~q with negative
contributions outside the classically allowed region, thus incorporating quantum
correlations into phase space. We have calculated the Wigner function following
Eichenauer etal. [18].

3.2. The product distribution

As the name indicates the product distribution is deﬁned as the product of the radial
quantum probabilities in coordinate and momentum space [39], in our case for the
hydrogen ground state:

w(r, p) = ρ(r) × σ(p) with

ρ(r) = 4r2e−2r

and σ(p) =

32p2
π(1 + p2)4 ,

(14)

where r = |~q| and p = |~p|. Clearly, by deﬁnition the correct quantum density is
obtained in coordinate or momentum space as for the Wigner function (13). However,
now the directions of ~q and ~p are independent of each other.

3.3. The microcanonical distribution

The microcanonical distribution is the standard (classical) distribution of CTMC
based on Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom [17]. The classically accessible area
of phase space on the energy shell is sampled with equal probability in angle–action
coordinates. This distribution has the “correct” vanishing spread of the binding energy
and the correct quantum density in momentum space. However, the coordinate space
density

has a cutoﬀ which is not present in the quantum density (cf.
microcanonical distribution is derived from Bohr’s atomic model, there exists, of
course, no extension to construct a corresponding classical distribution for more
complex targets, e.g., the helium atom. Finally we note that the Wigner distribution,
if forced to be on the energy shell, reduces to the microcanonical distribution for
hydrogen.

(15)

3.4. Cohen’s distribution

In order to preserve the stationarity of the microcanonical distribution, but still come
closer to the quantum densities Cohen proposed another distribution which we will call
Cohen’s distribution in the following [20]: It is obtained by summing microcanonical
distributions of diﬀerent energies such that the mean binding energy is correct and
only bound orbits contribute. The resulting (analytical) coordinate density is set to
the quantum mechanical one. By these constraints the system of equations is already
fully determined and the momentum density obtained is only slightly diﬀerent from
the quantum mechanical one. The energy spread of this distribution is small compared
to the Wigner or product distribution.

In the following we will see how these four distributions perform under diﬀerent
collisions. Thereby, we will also gain some insight which properties of the target
system are highlighted by a speciﬁc cross section.

4. Results for electron impact ionization of hydrogen at three diﬀerent
impact energies

We will present our results for the three diﬀerent impact energies of 250 eV, 54.4 eV
and 17.6 eV. These values are motivated by existing experimental data for comparison.
At a given impact energy all cross sections, total, single and multiple diﬀerential ones,
can be extracted from the same numerical data set, see table 2. The only diﬀerence
is that higher diﬀerential cross sections require many more trajectories to achieve
suﬃcient statistics since only a few hundred out of several million trajectories typically
contribute to a fully diﬀerential cross section.

For this reason we have carefully implemented the numerical integration of the
trajectories. The equations of motion have been regularized to avoid the attractive
Coulomb singularities [40] and a sixth order symplectic integrator [41] with adaptive
stepsize control has been used. Hence, we are able to handle electron trajectories
which directly hit the nucleus. As a consequence the integration is very stable: At a
given total energy less than ten trajectories had to be discarded due to a too large

be signiﬁcantly fewer than those contributing to a fully diﬀerential cross section.

4.1. Total ionization cross sections

energies compared to experimental data by Shah etal. [42].

The total cross section was calculated for the energy range from 15 eV up to 500
eV impact energy. As one can see from ﬁg. 1 the overall trend of the experimental
cross section is reproduced. However, the energy at the maximum of the cross section
is too low by nearly a factor of two and the high energy limit of the calculations
obeys the classical 1/E law [43] instead of the quantum mechanical ln(E)/E behavior
[44]. The fact that all initial state distributions, from the classical microcanonical one
to the quantum Wigner distribution, result in the same total cross section to within
some ten percent shows that the deviation from the exact result is mainly due to the

dynamical evolution of the distribution during the collision. The classical evolution
cannot account for quantum tunneling, e.g., which becomes relevant for higher impact
energies.

Can one hope under these circumstances to obtain reasonable results for
diﬀerential cross sections? As it has been shown previously [4] disagreement in the
absolute values of the cross section does not necessarily imply a similar disagreement
in the shape of the diﬀerential cross sections.

4.2. Single diﬀerential ionization cross section

Generally the single-diﬀerential cross section evolves from a U–shaped form for high
energies (ﬁg. 2, left panel, at 250 eV) to a ﬂat curve for low energies (ﬁg. 2, right panel,
at 17.6 eV) The cross section at 54.4 eV follows this trend and is not shown here.
There is little diﬀerence between the initial distributions. The agreement with the
(scaled) experiment by Shyn [45] as well as with a calculation by Roy [46] employing
an exchange–modiﬁed Glauber approximation is fairly good at 250 eV. Our result is
also consistent with a coupled pseudo state approximation [47] and a distorted-wave
Born calculation [48]. At 17.6 eV the form of the quasiclassical cross section agrees
well with results for the L = 0 partial wave obtained with two diﬀerent fully quantal
methods, namely exterior complex scaling and a time dependent CCC method [10].
However, there is clear disagreement with Bray’s CCC calculation [49]. In this context
it should be noted that towards threshold (13.6 eV impact energy) the contributions
of all partial waves should behave as the S-wave contribution [50]. Moreover, the
Wannier theory and classical calculations [51] predict a ﬂat cross section to within
5%.

Overall, the single diﬀerential cross sections are in good agreement with the
experiment and full quantum calculations and they do not provide a critical test
for the used initial phase space distributions. However, the very formulation of energy
diﬀerential cross sections for non–stationary initial distributions has been possible only
by the deﬁnition of the cross section in terms of the energy transfer (see sec. 2.3 and
table 1).

4.3. Multiply diﬀerential cross sections at 250 eV impact energy

The impact energy of 250 eV has often been studied, since it is high enough for the ﬁrst
Born approximation to be applicable, but still not too high for a reasonable counting
rate in the experiments.

4.3.1. Double diﬀerential ionization cross section As an example for a double
diﬀerential cross section we present the angular distribution of the electrons for ﬁxed
energy sharing of 231.4 eV + 5 eV. The shape from the diﬀerent distributions in the
left panel of ﬁg. 3 for the fast electron is similar and close to the quantum calculations
(there are no experiments available for this energy).

Figure 3. Doubly diﬀerential cross section for the fast (Eb = 231.4 eV, left
panel) and the slow electrons (5 eV, right panel). The DDCS for the diﬀerent
initial distributions are scaled to give the correct total cross section. The cross
sections for the fast electrons are compared to the quantum calculations of Bray
[52], the slow electrons to the calculation of Berakdar [6] and the experiments of
Shyn [45]. “Born” denotes a ﬁrst order Born approximation.

The situation is quite diﬀerent for the slow electron (ﬁg. 3, right panel). However,
the large deviation from the experiment at small angles is probably due to a systematic

error in the experiment [45] (see remarks in [6, 52]). More interesting for us is the
fact that already at the level of double diﬀerential cross sections diﬀerent initial state
distributions begin to make a diﬀerence. In particular the microcanonical distribution
leads to a cross section with opposite trend compared to the others. The binary peak
(around 70◦) is almost absent and the cross section is shifted towards larger angles.
Apparently, the angular dependence of the scattered slow electron is sensitive to the
initial spatial distribution of the bound electron which is not correctly modeled in the
microcanonical distribution (see (14), (15)).

4.3.2. Triple diﬀerential ionization cross section For electron impact ionization of
hydrogen at an impact energy of 250 eV a wide range of available data exists from
[1, 2, 53, 54]) as well as from
measured fully diﬀerential cross sections (see, e.g.
calculated ones, for a recent review see [55].

The small volume of the ﬁnal phase space imposes a serious statistical limit on
our quasiclassical calculations: A triply diﬀerential cross section at the experimental
resolutions of about ± 1◦ in the scattering angle of the fast electron, ± 2◦ for the slow
electron, the deﬁnition of the scattering plane at ± 10◦ and an energy resolution of
less then 1 eV consists of a fraction of less then 10−9 of the ﬁnal state phase space
volume only. If the ionization events were equally distributed over the whole phase
space, we would hardly ﬁnd one trajectory for a cross section. Due to the structure in
the pattern of the outgoing electrons, we can record about 100 to 300 events for those
conﬁgurations where experimental data is available.

The small number of trajectories contributing to the TDCS forced us to set
the bins of the scattering angle θb larger than their distance. With this trick each
event contributes to two or three adjacent data points of the cross section. Still, the
comparison with the DDCS shows that the number of propagated trajectories would
have to be increased by one or two orders of magnitude for full statistical convergence.
Once the trajectories have been calculated it is easy to ﬁlter out cross sections
for arbitrary ﬁnal electron conﬁgurations. We will show cross sections for some of the
measured data in Ehrhardt geometry, where the fast electron is ﬁxed at a small angle
and the angular distribution of the slow electron at a ﬁxed energy is measured: This
conﬁguration is very sensitive to the details of the initial distribution and, due to the
slow ionized electron, to the dynamics of the reaction. In general two main features
appear: the so called binary peak, located around the direction of the momentum
transfer (in the range between 70◦ and 85◦) is usually explained by the classical picture
of a binary scattering of the two electrons without interacting with the nucleus. The
recoil peak consists of electrons which are rescattered from the nucleus by 180◦ after
the binary encounter. The recoil peak lies roughly opposite to the binary peak (for
an overview over the various processes and their explanations see, e.g., [56]).

Out of the many parameters for which experimental data is available we show two
examples from Erhardt [1, 2] in ﬁgure 4. Angles out of the scattering plane between
±5◦ and ±20◦ have virtually no inﬂuence on the shape of the cross section, they only
aﬀect the statistics. We set the angular range to ±10◦.

As it is clear from ﬁgure 4 the microcanonical distribution is not capable of
reproducing the main features of the cross section: there is no binary peak (the
“classical” part of the cross section) at small momentum transfer and at higher
momentum transfer it is much too small and shifted to larger angles. There is some
structure in the region of the recoil peak, but as its maximum is opposite to the
direction of the fast outgoing electron, this is probably an “artifact” of the calculation.

Figure 4. Fully diﬀerential cross sections in Ehrhardt geometry. The present
calculations are scaled to give the correct total cross section. The absolute
measurements are from Ehrhardt etal. [1].

To describe the recoil peak in a quantum Born approximation the ﬁnal state
wave function for the slow electron has to be a Coulomb wave, i.e., it must include
the interaction with the nucleus. The overlap of this inﬁnitely extended wave
function with the small, localized, radially symmetric ground state selects only the
central region of the Coulomb wave, which correspondents to rescattering at vanishing
impact parameter. In the classical approximation only a vanishingly small fraction
of trajectories leads to a head on collision with the nucleus after the momentum has
been transferred. Hence the probability for rescattering by 180◦ is negligible and

this quantum interpretation of the recoil peak can only be used with caution for the
classical approximation. However, one should keep in mind that this picture of the
electron recoil from the nucleus comes from the Born perturbation series with its
hierarchy of orders, i.e., a number of sudden two particle interactions takes place one
after the other [56]. It is only in this interpretation, that ionization and rescattering
are two distinct events; in the full dynamical description all three bodies interact
simultaneously.

The other three distributions perform remarkably better, especially with the
product and the Wigner distribution the position and the width of the binary
maximum are reproduced to within the statistical uncertainties.
These two
distributions are characterized by the correct densities in coordinate and momentum
space, whereas Cohen’s energy distribution lacks the correct momentum distribution
and the microcanonical one has the wrong spatial dependence. We may conclude, that
at 250 eV impact energy the cross section is a projection of the initial distribution’s
phase space density onto the ﬁnal conﬁguration: both, in momentum and in coordinate
space the description of the target must be correct.

4.4. Multiply diﬀerential cross sections at 54.4 eV impact energy

The impact energy of 54.4 eV is close to the maximum of the experimental total cross
section. The presentation of the cross sections will be similar to that at 250 eV.

4.4.1. Double diﬀerential
ionization cross section The doubly diﬀerential cross
section is presented again for a pair of matching energies for the fast (ﬁg. 5) and the
slow electrons (ﬁg. 6) with 35.8 eV and 5 eV, respectively. No experimental data exists
for the fast electrons. Comparison, however, is possible with Bray’s CCC calculation
[52]. For the slow electrons, experiments by Shyn are available, but only at an impact
energy of 60 eV. These experimental data were scaled onto the correct total cross
section at 54.4 eV. They show systematically too high values at small angles similarly
as for 250 eV (cf. section 4.3.1 and refs. [6, 52]).

The cross sections for the faster electrons are similar (ﬁg. 5), the quasiclassical
results show slightly higher contributions at angles above 45◦, almost independent of
the phase space distribution describing the target.

Figure 6. Left: Doubly diﬀerential cross section at Ein = 54.4 eV of the slow
electrons with Eb = 5 eV. The quasiclassical and the experimental results were
scaled to the correct total cross section. The experiment [45] is wrong again at
small angles, the full curve is the fully quantum mechanical calculation of ref.
[52]. Right: the same as left, but here the Wigner result is not weighted with the
sign of the Wigner distribution, see text for explanation.

For the slow electrons the picture is quite diﬀerent (ﬁg. 6, left panel): the Wigner
distribution reproduces the position of the binary peak (about 70◦) and its width fairly
well, whereas the microcanonical distribution nearly inverts the shape of the quantum
mechanical cross section. Cohen’s energy distribution gives a cross section somewhere
between the quantum Wigner description and the classical microcanonical modeling.
The cross section from the product distribution is much too high at small angles.
This behavior can be simulated with the Wigner distribution as well, if |wn| is taken
instead of wn in (10), see the right panel of ﬁg. 6.

The Wigner and the product distribution both reproduce the correct density
in coordinate and momentum space; the diﬀerence is that in the quantum Wigner
distribution the radius and the momentum vector are correlated with negative weights
in regions outside of the classical turning point (see sec. 3.1). The diﬀerence between
the Wigner cross section with the correct sign for each ﬁnal value and the one with
the same sign for each trajectory shows, that the contributions at small scattering
angles come from these outer regions. The negative parts of the Wigner distribution
lead to partial cancellation of classically allowed contributions, which nevertheless
do not occur in the cross section. The product distribution lacks the correlations
and consequently gives the wrong cross section at small angles, here all trajectories
contribute. In the microcanonical distribution no initial values at all exist for radii
larger than 2 a.u., consequently the cross section is much too small for small angles.
We conclude that this type of a doubly diﬀerential cross section strongly depends on
quantal features which are beyond the scope of a purely classical ansatz as standard
CTMC. However, they can be incorporated in our ¯h = 0 approximation through the
initial distribution.

4.4.2. Triple diﬀerential ionization cross section The triply diﬀerential cross section
at 54.4 eV impact energy has been measured by R¨oder etal [57] in Ehrhardt geometry.
We show the cross sections for the parameters given in table 4.

The DDCS for the fast electrons, ﬁg. 5, is too high for small angles. We therefore
not only scale the TDCS onto the total cross section, but additionally for θa = 4◦

by a factor of 0.25. This scaling has been performed to see, if the shape of the cross
sections for the slow electrons is reproduced correctly.

The diﬀerences between the phase space distributions can be seen clearly:
the classical microcanonical distribution fails to reproduce the binary peak at all
parameters, whereas the recoil peak agrees astonishingly well. The next more quantal
description, Cohen’s energy distribution, performs better with increasing θa, but the
angle of the binary peak is always too large. The opposite tendency, placing the
binary peak at too small angles, is seen with the product distribution. At small θa
the electrons even leave in the same direction, a conﬁguration that should be strongly
suppressed by their mutual repulsion. This problem will be discussed in detail for the
impact energy of 17.6 eV. The distribution which is closest to quantum mechanics,
the Wigner distribution, can reproduce the cross sections over the entire range of
parameters, but with similar eﬀects of both electrons leaving in forward direction at
θa = 4◦.

At this impact energy switching from the classical models of the microcanonical
or Cohen’s energy distribution that only reproduce either the coordinate or the
momentum space density, to the more quantal ones results in a deﬁnite improvement
in the cross sections. The product distribution, which satisﬁes both momentum and
coordinate space densities, already shows a binary peak, although shifted. With the
correlated Wigner distribution the best correspondence between experiment and our
calculations is achieved.

4.5. Multiply diﬀerential cross sections at 17.6 eV impact energy

At the low impact energy of 17.6 eV the projectile is only slightly faster than a classical
electron on a circular orbit with the Bohr radius and the ionized electrons can only
share 4 eV of energy. Hence, we expect diﬀerent qualities of the initial distribution to
become important, compared to the higher impact energies.

At these low energies quantum calculations, using analytic ﬁnal state wave
functions constructed from two-body wave functions, fail or perform only very poorly
[55]. This indicates, that here a correct description of the simultaneous interaction of
the three particles is crucial. In this context it should be emphasized that we do not
approximate the three-body dynamics beyond the classical ¯h = 0 limit: All long range
Coulomb interactions between all particles are taken fully into account.

4.5.1. Double diﬀerential ionization cross section For the DDCS no experimental
comparison exists, our results will be compared to Bray’s CCC calculation [49] and
to results of an ECS calculation by Isaacs etal [12]. For symmetric energy sharing the
CCC single diﬀerential cross section is too small by approximately one third, hence
the CCC DDCS was scaled by 1/0.66 for better comparison of the shape. Our results
are scaled onto the total cross section again.

scaled according to the total cross section and the form of the DDCS (for 4◦, see
text). The absolute measurements are by R¨oder etal. [57]

As can be seen in ﬁg. 8, the more classical phase space distributions give
considerably better results. With the microcanonical distribution the cross section
deviates only for angles of less than 30◦ around the forward and backward direction.
With Cohen’s distribution the shape is too ﬂat, whereas the Wigner and the product
distribution overestimate the forward direction. Both electrons have the same small
ﬁnal energy, which means that they inﬂuence each other for a long time. Consequently,
these cross sections are more dominated by the post collisional interaction (PCI) than
those at higher energies. In order to describe PCI eﬀects correctly, the relative energy

terms of the energy transfer this ratio is correctly described only for initial distributions
on the energy shell (i.e. without an energy spread).

The measurements were done by R¨oder etal [57, 58]

For the Wigner and the product distribution the same behavior as at Ein =
54.4 eV can be observed, but now the fraction of electrons going into the same
direction is much larger, see the fully symmetric cross section and in Ehrhardt
geometry, ﬁg. 9. This should not occur due to the mutual repulsion of the electrons.
However, for those initial distributions which are not restricted to the energy shell
(all but the microcanonical one) the energy of the initially bound electron calculated
from the energy transfer does not necessarily correspond to the actual momentum
of the electron. Hence, the two electrons may leave the nucleus one after the other,
although they have the same “nominal” energy. This problem does not occur for the
microcanonical distribution which is on the energy shell.

At 17.6 eV impact energy none of the initial distributions can fully reproduce the
cross sections, but in the overall picture Cohen’s distribution plays best: the energy
spread is on the one hand small enough to prevent the electrons from going into the
same direction and on the other hand the phase space density is still accurate enough
for the “fast” binary ionization process. Hence, Cohen’s distribution is the only one

height (ﬁg. 9). At constant θab for all but Cohen’s distribution the (relative) magnitude
of the cross section for diﬀerent angles is grossly wrong (ﬁg. 10). For the Wigner and
the product distribution even the shape of the cross section is in disagreement with
the experiment at θab = 90◦.

The cross sections at 17.6 eV show that even at this low total energy the fully
diﬀerential cross section is sensitive to the initial phase space density. On the other
hand Wannier’s arguments suggest that close to threshold the cross sections depend

of the ionization dynamics [59]. To describe it correctly the accurate energy of the

5. Summary and outlook

We have derived and tested a quasiclassical ansatz for charged particle impact
ionization. Starting from the time-dependent quantum mechanical formulation in the
quantum Wigner picture we can reproduce in the limit ¯h = 0 the standard Classical
Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method. However, our ansatz is more general. By
keeping the backward–forward propagation scheme of the Møller formalism and by
deﬁning the cross section in terms of energy transfer we can exploit the full classical
limit (¯h = 0) of the Wigner distribution for the initial state, which is neither stationary
in the classical approximation nor conﬁned to the energy shell, two properties which
are necessary for standard CTMC. In fact, our formulation allows one to use arbitrary
initial phase space distributions. We have calculated and compared fully diﬀerential
classical ionization cross sections for four initial state distributions: the quantum
Wigner function, the (standard) classical microcanonical distribution and two other
distributions which interpolate to some extent between Wigner and microcanonical
distribution. From our results we conclude that at high impact energies the density
in phase space is the crucial property to describe the ionization process. For lower
energies the correlation between coordinate and momentum becomes increasingly
important. Even at the low energy of 4 eV above threshold the initial state has
to be modeled correctly in coordinate and momentum space, although the long time
evolution of the slow ionized electrons gains more and more inﬂuence on the dynamics.
The classical calculations are not meant to be a high quality alternative for
quantum treatments; rather we wanted to formulate and test a consistent quasiclassical
scattering theory, applicable to the most diﬀerential cross sections, and free from the
limitation to one active target electron of previous approaches. Yet, most of the
technical expertise from previous CTMC calculations can be used with only minor
modiﬁcations in the description of the initial target state, the propagation scheme
and the extraction of the cross sections.

With the present work we have demonstrated for one-electron targets, namely
hydrogen, that the aforementioned goals can be achieved. However, the main
advantage of being able to deal with unstable initial distributions will become apparent
when calculating double ionization of two-electron atoms. The classical autoionization
of the bound electrons does not aﬀect our quasiclassical approach. What should
be improved in future work, particularly if one is interested in collisions with small
excess energy, is the implementation of contributions oﬀ the energy shell. Since we
have seen that less diﬀerential cross sections tend to be better approximated with the
quasiclassical approach we are optimistic that a quasiclassical triple diﬀerential cross
section will be more accurate for double ionization than for single ionization. However,
this remains to be proven in future work.

Most of this work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through

the SFB 276 at the University of Freiburg, Germany.

We present a theoretical model for atomic hydrogen ionization by electron impact in the instan-
taneous approximation and the more accurate non-instantaneous approach using the methods of
Quantum Electrodynamics, for the binary coplanar and the coplanar asymmetric geometries. All
electrons are described by plane wave functions in the coplanar binary geometry but in the asym-
metric geometry the ejected electron is described by a Sommerfeld-Maue wave function. It is shown
that the two models give the same results in the non relativistic limit for the binary coplanar ge-
ometry where the interactions can be treated as instantaneous. However, this is no longer true for
the relativistic case where one has to take into account both the instantaneous interaction and the
radiation interaction. These results are obtained in the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of electrons with atoms is the ﬁeld that
most deeply probes both the structure and reaction dy-
namics of a many-body system [1]. Electron-atom colli-
sions that ionize the target provide a large and interest-
ing diversity of phenomena. The reason for this is that
a three-body ﬁnal state allows a wide range of kinematic
regions to be investigated. These diﬀerent kinetic regions
depend sensitively on diﬀerent aspects of the description
of the collision. Up to now, there has been no calcu-
lation of diﬀerential cross-sections by a method that is
generally valid. The understanding of the ionization by
electron impact has advanced by an iterative process in-
volving experiments and calculations that emphasize dif-
ferent aspects of the reaction. Kinematic regions have
been found that are completely understood in the sense
that absolute diﬀerential cross-sections in detailed agree-
ment with experiment can be calculated.
These form the basis of a structure probe, electron mo-
mentum spectroscopy, that is extremely sensitive to one-
electron and electron-correlation properties of the target
ground states of the residual ion in the case of heavy
atoms. Other kinematic regions require a complete de-
scription of the collision which may be facilitated by in-
cluding the boundary condition for the three charged
particles in the ﬁnal states. This point is not trivial
at all because there is no separation distance at which
the Coulomb forces in the three-body system are strictly
negligible. The pioneering experiments of Ehrhardt et

al [2] are of this type. Electron-impact ionization has
been studied experimentally using relativistic electrons
by Dangerﬁeld and Spicer [3], Hoﬀman et all (1979) [4]
and Anholt (1979) [5]. The measurements with relativis-
tic electrons have all been of total cross-sections typically
for the K and L shells of heavy atoms. Theoretical mod-
els for total ionization cross-sections have been developed
by a number of authors including Scoﬃeld (1978) [6] and
Moiseiwitsh and Stockmann (1980) [7]. This ﬁeld has
been reviewed by Moiseiwitsh (1980) [8]. Fuss, Mitroy
and Spicer (1982) [9] have developed a theoretical model
for the binary (e,2e) reaction. This (e,2e) reaction is
that were the outgoing electrons have equal energy. The
theoretical model they have developed uses the impulse
and relativistic plane wave Born approximations (RP-
WBA). Nakel and Whelan (1999) [10] have reviewed the
experimental and theoretical developments in the study
of relativistic (e,2e). They argued that the fully relativis-
tic distorted wave approximation (RDWBA) proposed by
Walters et al [11] was the simple possible approximation
that allows to gain understanding of the relativistic (e,2e)
processes.
As for electron impact ionization for a hydrogen atomic
target, the ﬁrst work that relied on the model devel-
oped by Fuss et al [9], was presented by Attaourti et al
[12] who studied the importance of the relativistic elec-
tronic dressing during the process of laser-assisted ion-
ization of atomic hydrogen by electron impact. Taking
a zero laser electric ﬁeld, one recovers the binary (e,2e)
process in the absence of the laser ﬁeld in the instan-
taneous approximation where a direct non relativistic
interaction potential was used. Later on, Attaourti et
al (2005) [13] developed a simple semi-relativistic model
using a Sommerfeld-Maue wave function to describe the
ejected electron and the Darwin semi-relativistic wave
function to describe the hydrogen atomic target in its

ground state [14] also in the instantaneous interaction.
This simple model allows to investigate both the rela-
tivistic binary (e,2e) reaction process (RPWBA) and the
semi-relativistic (e,2e) process in the coplanar asymmet-
ric geometry (SRCBA).
The purpose of the present work is to go beyond the
instantaneous approximation and use the propagator ap-
proach of QED to include both the instantaneous and
radiation contributions necessary to describe more ac-
curately the (e,2e) processes in the relativistic domain.
Indeed, it is well known that non relativistically, interac-
tions are instantaneous but this is no longer true in the
relativistic case. This important feature of relativistic
collision processes is explicitly contained in the formal-
ism of QED. This important point is clearly explained
for example by F. Gross (1999) [15], W. Greiner (1996)
[16] and many others. To what extent the contribution
of both the instantaneous and radiation parts to these
(e,2e) processes aﬀect and modify the non polarized dif-
ferential cross section is the question we want to address
and study.
The organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2,
we review the RPWBA formalism in the instantaneous
approximation and give the theoretical results for the
same model within the framework of QED. In section 3,
we review the SRCBA formalism in the instantaneous ap-
proximation and give theoretical results using full QED
calculations. In section 4, we discuss some relevant re-
sults and in section 5, we end by a conclusion. Through-
out this work, we use atomic units and the metric tensor
gµν = diag(1,

1).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Before beginning the discussion of the results obtained,
it is worthwhile to recall the meaning of some abbrevia-
tions that will appear throughout this section. The NRP-
WBA stands for the non relativistic plane wave Born ap-
proximation where non relativistic plane waves are used
to describe the incident, scattered and ejected electrons.
This approximation is valid only in the non relativistic
regime and particularly in the case of the coplanar sym-
metric geometry. The NRCBA approximation stands for
the non relativistic Coulomb Born approximation which
is valid only in the non relativistic regime and in the
case of the asymmetric coplanar geometry of Ehrhardt
[2]. The RPWBANP stands for the relativistic plane
wave Born approximation without propagator, which is
valid for the case of a coplanar binary geometry and uses
Dirac free plane wave solutions as well as a direct in-
Its results take only into account
teraction potential.
the instantaneous part of the interaction potential. The
RPWBAWP stands for the relativistic plane wave Born
approximation with the inclusion of the photon propaga-
tor.It is valid for the case of a coplanar binary geometry,
uses Dirac free plane wave solutions and its results take
into account the instantaneous part of the interaction as
well as the radiation part of the interaction. The SR-
CBANP stands for the semi relativistic Coulomb Born
approximation which is valid both for the coplanar asym-
metric geometry and the binary coplanar geometry. In
this approximation, the incident and scattered electrons
are described by free Dirac plane waves while the ejected

electron is described by a Sommerfeld-Maue wave func-
tion and the atomic hydrogen target is described by a
Darwin wave function [14]. However, its uses a direct in-
teraction potential in the instantaneous approximation.
Finally, the SRCBAWP stands for the semi relativistic
Coulomb Born approximation with the full inclusion of
the photon propagator. It is similar to the previous ap-
proximation except that it includes both the instanta-
neous and radiation parts of the interaction.
Due to this number of approximations that may be con-
fusing, we will focus in our discussion on the most im-
portant features of our model and restrain ourselves to
consider in the non relativistic regime, the comparison of
all the TDCSs in the case of the binary coplanar geome-
try. In the case of the coplanar asymmetric geometry, we
will compare the three relevant TDCSs, the SRCBAWP,
the SRCBANP and the NRCBA.

A. The non relativistic regime

1. The binary coplanar geometry

5

We begin our discussion by the kinematics of the pro-
cess. For the binary coplanar geometry, we choose the
following angular situation where pi is along the Oz axis
(θi = φi = 0◦). For the scattered electron, we choose
(θf = 45◦, φf = 0◦) and for the ejected electron we
choose φB = 180◦) and the angle θB varies from 30◦
to 60◦. The energies of the incident and ejected electrons
are respectively Ei = 2700 eV and EB = 1349.5 eV . It is
expected that for such a regime and choice of geometry,
relativistic eﬀects will be small and it is indeed the case
as this can be seen in Fig.1 where the six approaches give
nearly the same results. Even if this is not apparent on
this ﬁgure, we have plotted the results of six approaches
and obtained close results.
In the binary coplanar ge-
ometry, the TDCSs are well peaked around the speciﬁc
angle θf chosen and decrease very rapidly to zero within a
small angular spread (typically ten degrees). The energy
of the incident electron being non relativistic (it corre-
(βi)2)(−1/2)),
sponds to a relativistic parameter γi = (1
the description of the interaction potential by a direct
non relativistic potential or the use of the photon prop-
agator is not important in that case.

The angle φB is such that φB = 180◦. The curves of the six
approaches overlap.

2. The coplanar asymmetric geometry

−

In this geometry, the use of any approach involv-
ing plane waves will lead to irrelevant results since the
Coulomb description of the ejected electron is needed.
The angular choice is as follows : pi is along the Oz axis
and θi = 0◦, φi = 0◦. For the scattered electron, we
choose (θf = 3◦, φf = 0◦), for the ejected electron we
choose φB = 180◦ and the angle θB varies from
180◦ to
180◦. The energy of the incident electron is Ei = 2700
eV and the energy of the ejected electron is EB = 54. eV .
The range of the angular variable θB is due to the fact
that in the coplanar asymmetric geometry, one expects
to see two peaks, a binary peak which is, in our case,
located in the vicinity of θB = 77◦ and a recoil peak
105◦. As a va-
which is located in the vicinity of θB =
lidity check of our calculations, we have also reproduced
the results of Byron and Joachain [17] for the energies
Ei = 250 eV and EB = 5. eV . The three approaches :
NRCBA, SRCBAWP and SRCBANP are shown in Fig.
2 where the spread of the three TDCSs covers the whole
range that the angular variable θB can take and small dif-
ferences begin to appear particularly at the recoil peak.
However and as might be expected for such energies, the
SRCBAWP and the SRCBANP remain very close be-
cause for such a regime the use of the instantaneous or
the non instantaneous approximation amounts to nearly
the same. Radiation eﬀects are not important enough for
such non relativistic energies.

B. The relativistic regime

1. The binary coplanar geometry

For this regime, the energy of the incident electron is
Ei = 511002 eV and the energy of the ejected electron
is EB = 225501 eV . This value of the energy Ei corre-
sponds to a relativistic parameter γi = 2. We choose the
following angular situation where pi is along the Oz axis
(θi = φi = 0◦). For the scattered electron, we choose
(θf = 55◦, φf = 0◦) and for the ejected electron we
choose φB = 180◦ and the angle θB varies from 30◦ to
60◦. Relativistic eﬀects can no longer be neglected and
also the use of the instantaneous approximation becomes
itself questionable. Let us explain what is contained in
Fig 3. The ﬁrst important point that has to be mentioned
is the following : in such a regime, the use of non relativis-
tic approaches is not physically founded. So, we will fo-
cus mainly on the four relativistic approximations afore-
mentioned. What appears clearly is that the four rela-
tivistic models give diﬀerent results with the importance
of radiation eﬀects clearly shown. To summarize Fig 3,
we can say that as regards to the SRCBAWP and SR-
CBANP, the instantaneous approximations is no longer

valid. We have a situation where the TDCS(SRCBAWP)
and also
than the TDCS(SRCBANP)
is higher
where the TDCS(RPWBAWP)
than the
is higher
TDCS(RPWBANP). This is a general rule and we
have made many simulations to assert that it is a
valid rule in the relativistic regime. However, there
is no general rule as to the comparison between the
TDCS(SRCBAWP) and the TDCS(RPWBAWP) as well
as the comparison between the TDCS(RPWBANP) and
the TDCS(SRCBANP) because another choice of (θf ,
e.g θf = 39◦ will give rise to a reverse situation where
T DCS(RP W BAW P ) > T DCS(SRCBAW P ) whereas
T DCS(RP W BAN P ) > T DCS(SRCBAW P ).

In Fig. 4, we only compare the two SRCBAWP and
SRCBANP to assess the importance of radiation eﬀects
and as this behavior never changes, one can easily see
that the use of the instantaneous approximation under-
estimates the value of the TDCS using the photon prop-
agator by a factor two. The same behavior is observed
with the RPWBAWP and the RPWBANP.

FIG. 4: TDCS scaled in 10−13 for the energies Ei = 511002
eV and EB = 225501 eV , and the angles θf = 39◦, θi = φi =
φf = 0◦. The angle φB is such that φB = 180◦.

FIG. 5: TDCS scaled in 10−12 for Ei = 511002 eV and EB =
10220.04 eV , and the angles θf = 3◦, θi = φi = φf = 0◦.The
angle φB is such that φB = 180◦.

2. The coplanar asymmetric geometry

In this geometry, the angular choice is as follows : pi is
along the Oz axis and θi = 3◦, φi = 0◦. For the scattered
electron, we choose (θf = 3◦, φf = 0◦), for the ejected
electron we choose φB = 180◦ and the angle θB varies
from 0◦ to 180◦. The energy of the incident electron is
Ei = 511002 eV and the energy of the ejected electron
is EB = 10220.04 eV . In the relativistic regime, there
is no occurrence of a recoil peak and the spread of the
angular variable θB of the ejected electron is reduced.
As expected, radiation eﬀects are indeed important and
in Fig. 5, we see that the binary peak is located in the
vicinity of θB = 75◦ whereas the TDCS(SRCBANP) un-
derestimates the TDCS(SRCBAWP) by a factor 2. The
comparison with the two other approaches using rela-
tivistic plane waves is not relevant for this geometry.

V. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have studied the two theoretical
models (instantaneous and non-instantaneous approxi-
mations) for the relativistic ionization of atomic hydro-

gen by electron impact using non relativistic or rela-
tivistic plane wave functions to describe all electrons in
the binary coplanar geometry and using the Sommerfed-
Maue wave function to describe the ejected electron in
the case of the coplanar asymmetric geometry. In all the
approaches using relativistic plane waves, the use of the
exact relativistic wave function for atomic hydrogen in
its ground state is tractable, whereas in the asymmetric
case, one can only use the semi relativistic Darwin wave
function [14] to describe the atomic target. The general
conclusions that can be drawn from this work are sum-
marized in what follows. In the non relativistic regime,
the results obtained in the binary coplanar geometry give
the same results for an appropriate choice of the angular
parameters whereas in the coplanar asymmetric geome-
try, on can only compare the three approaches NRCBA,
SRCBAWP and SRCBANP. This comparison has been
made and it was shown that though relatively small, the
presence of a recoil peak together with a visible binary
peak even for an incident electron energy of 2700 eV
reproduces the qualitative features of the Ehrhardt ge-
ometry [2].
In the relativistic regime radiation eﬀects are important
and the general rule that can be ﬁrmly asserted is the

following : the instantaneous approach is always smaller
than the non instantaneous approach because radiation
eﬀects can no longer be ignored. The use of the pho-

ton propagator as well as the QED formalism becomes
necessary.

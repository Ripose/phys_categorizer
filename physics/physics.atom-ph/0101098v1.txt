We propose a direct method of detection of the nuclear anapole
moment. It is based on the existence of a linear Stark shift for
alkali atoms in their ground state perturbed by a quadrupolar
interaction of uniaxial symmetry around a direction ˆn and a
magnetic ﬁeld. This shift is characterized by the T-even pseu-
~B)/B2. It involves on the one hand the
doscalar (ˆn
anisotropy of the hyperﬁne interaction induced by the quadrupo-
lar interaction and, on the other, the static electric dipole mo-
ment arising from electroweak interactions inside the nucleus.
The case of ground state Cs atoms trapped in a uniaxial (hcp)
phase of solid 4He is examined. From an explicit evaluation of
both the hyperﬁne structure anisotropy and the static dipole de-
duced from recent empirical data about the Cs nuclear anapole
moment, we predict the Stark shift. It is three times the exper-
imental upper bound to be set on the T-odd Stark shift of free
Cs atoms in order to improve the present limit on the electron
EDM.

Introduction

It has been well demonstrated that parity violation in atomic transitions can be used
to test electroweak theory [1]. In this way, the Standard Model has been conﬁrmed
convincingly in the domain of low energies. At present, reﬁnements in experiments
and theory allow more precise measurements to look for a breakdown of the Standard
Model predictions and hence, new physics [2, 3, 4, 5]. The essential parameter ex-
tracted from atomic parity violation (PV) measurements is the weak nuclear charge
QW . This electroweak parameter appears in the deﬁnition of the dominant electron-
nucleus PV potential induced by a Z0 exchange:

On top of this the PV electron-nucleus interaction involves also a nuclear spin-
dependent contribution which can provide valuable and original information regarding
Nuclear Physics. It is generated by an interaction of the current-current type with a
vector coupling for the electron and an axial coupling for the nucleus. The associated

where ~α is the Dirac matrix associated with the electron velocity operator, ~I the
nuclear spin and PA(r) a nuclear spin distribution normalized to unity. The weak
axial moment of the nucleus, AW , receives several contributions. The most obvious
one comes from the weak neutral vector boson Z0 with axial coupling to the nucleons.
However, in the standard electroweak model the coupling constants involved nearly
cancel accidentally. As ﬁrst pointed out by Flambaum et al. [11], a sizeable contri-
bution to AW is induced by the contamination of the atom by the PV interactions
between the nucleons which take place inside the nucleus. The concept relevant to
describe this interaction is the nuclear anapole moment [12].
In fact the interac-
tion can be interpreted simply in terms of a chiral contribution to the nuclear spin

[13]). The normal spin magnetization ~
MS(~r) is assumed to be a constant vector parallel to the
nuclear spin, distributed uniformely inside a sphere. Under the inﬂuence of PV nuclear forces,
the nuclear magnetization distribution inside the nucleus acquires a chiral parity non-conserving
component ~
MS(~r) through the very small angle β(r) around ~r. Three
chiral magnetization lines in the equatorial plane are shown. The vertical normal magnetization is
actually larger than ~
Mpnc(~r) by about six orders of magnitude. It can be shown [13] that the vertical
anapole moment is given, within a constant, by the magnetic moment obtained by identifying the
chiral magnetization lines with lines of electric currents.

PV nuclear forces inside any stable nucleus are responsible for the nuclear anapole
moment or equivalently a nuclear helimagnetism. The present paper addresses the
problem of how to detect directly this unique static nuclear property characteristic of
parity violation in stable nuclei.

Up to now there has been only one experimental demonstration of the nuclear
anapole moment, namely that obtained very recently by the Boulder group [10]. In
their experiment which gives a high precision determination of parity violation in the
7S1/2 Cs transition, this eﬀect appears as a small relative diﬀerence,

nuclear spin-dependent part a most delicate matter. In view of the importance of this
result for the determination of the PV pion-nucleon coupling constant, f 1
π (see [15]),
a totally independent determination is highly desirable.

It is well known that T reversal invariance forbids the manifestation of V (1)
in
pv
an atomic stationary state. However, we shall show in the following sections that in
such a state T reversal invariance does not forbid the manifestation of V (2)
pv , hence
that of the nuclear helimagnetism. For a free atom, the rotation symmetry of the
Hamiltonian leads to an exact cancellation of the diagonal matrix elements. This
property still holds true if the rotation symmetry is broken by the application of
static uniform electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However, if the symmetry is broken by
the application of a static potential of quadrupolar symmetry, for instance by trapping
the atoms inside a crystal of hexagonal symmetry, then, the stationary atomic states
are endowed with a permanent electric dipole moment which can give rise to a linear
Stark shift. This oﬀers a novel possibility of detecting the nuclear helimagnetism
having a twofold advantage:

i) In a stationary state it is the sole cause of P without T violation.
ii) It manifests itself by a modiﬁcation of the atomic transition frequencies in
an applied electric ﬁeld, i.e. a linear Stark shift, providing for the ﬁrst time an
opportunity for demonstrating the static character of this unusual nuclear property.

There exist in the literature other proposals for a direct detection in atoms of the

nuclear spin-dependent eﬀect, i.e. without any participation from V (1)
pv :

i) One is based on the diﬀerence between the selection rules of the potentials V (1)
pv
and V (2)
pv . While the former acts as a scalar in the total angular momentum space and
mixes only states of identical angular momentum (and opposite parity), the latter acts
like a vector and mixes states of diﬀerent total angular momentum. Consequently,
one can ﬁnd atomic transitions between states of the same parity which are allowed
for the nuclear spin dependent contribution but remain forbidden for the nuclear spin
independent one [16]. One such example is the (6p2)3P0 →
(6p2)1S0 lead transition at
339.4 nm, strictly forbidden for even isotopes, which acquires a non-vanishing matrix
element Epv
in odd isotopes owing to the PV interaction involving the nuclear spin,
1
which mixes the (6p2)1S0 state to the (6p7s)3P1 state of opposite parity [16].

ii) A second approach, invoked by several groups in the past and now under seri-
ous consideration [17], consists in the detection of an Epv
1 amplitude via a right-left
asymmetry appearing in hfs transition probabilities for the ground state of potas-
sium in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld (magnetic and hyperﬁne splittings of
comparable magnitude).

iii) There is also the possibility of detecting the energy diﬀerence in the NMR

spectrum of enantiomer molecules [18].

In view of the extreme diﬃculty of these other projects, we believe that, over

4

and above its intrisic scientiﬁc interest, the linear Stark shift discussed in this paper
deserves careful consideration.

→

The ﬁrst section of this paper recalls the main angular momentum properties of
the permanent nuclear spin-dependent PV electric dipole operator arising from the
nuclear anapole moment. In addition we compute its magnitude for the cesium atom
using recent empirical data relative to the Cs 6S
7S transition. The next section
(sec. 2) shows that this dipole can manifest itself via a linear Stark shift only if
the free atom symmetry is broken. After this we consider the case where the atom
is perturbed by a crystal ﬁeld of uniaxial symmetry. Here, the crystal axis ~n, and
the applied electric and magnetic ﬁelds create a chiral environment permitting the

section 3, we examine a realistic experimental situation where its observation looks
reasonably feasible: this deals with Cs atoms trapped inside a 4He crystal matrix
of hexagonal symmetry. We have investigated quantitatively how, by breaking the
atomic symmetry, the matrix induced perturbation manages to generate a linear Stark
shift. Moreover, we evaluate both the matrix induced anisotropy and the shift. The
details of the necessary calculation based on a semi-empirical method are given in the
Appendix. In the ﬁnal section we suggest another experimental approach in which
the atoms are no longer submitted to a crystal ﬁeld, but are instead perturbed by an
intense nonresonant radiation ﬁeld.

1 The permanent nuclear spin-dependent PV electric dipole

1.1

Symmetry considerations

The space-time symmetry properties of the atomic electric dipole induced by the
nuclear spin dependent PV interaction have been presented before in many review
papers (see for instance[19]). We recall them here for completeness, since they con-
stitute the starting point of the linear Stark shift calculation developed in the present
paper.

First, we wish to stress that the existence of the anapole moment interaction not
only implies the existence of a transition dipole proportional to the nuclear spin,
but also that of an electric dipole operator having diagonal matrix elements between
stationary atomic states. This electric dipole is found to be proportional to the
~I. Therefore it does not undergo the same transformation under P as
operator ~s
does an ordinary dipole, since it is a pseudovector instead of a vector. We also note
~E, associated with a

tion of this dipole requires special conditions for breaking the free-atom rotational
symmetry.

1.2 Magnitude of the permanent dipole.

The magnitude, dI, of the permanent dipole will play a decisive role in the assessment
of the feasibility of an experiment. We are now going to perform the evaluation of
dI in the interesting case of cesium. We proceed in two steps : ﬁrst we compute
directly b(6, 7) from experimental data, then we give a theoretical evaluation of the
ratio b(6, 6)/b(6, 7). It is convenient to use the notations of ref [7] and [13] and to

We are going to use Eqs.(5) and (19) for calculating the linear Stark shift.
It is
interesting to note here that these equations predict also the magnitude of the pv
transition dipole involved in an eventual Cs project which would be based on the
observation of hyperﬁne transitions in the Cs ground state, analogous to the potassium
project mentioned in the introduction (see also [17]). Therefore both a project of this
kind and the linear Stark shift discussed here aim at the determination of the same
physical parameter, dI, but only the observation of a dc Stark shift would prove its
static character.

4We use here the fact that, as noted by several authors, most of the sum (

98%) comes from

the four states 6P1/2, 7P1/2, 8P1/2, 9P1/2.

To do this we consider the transformation properties of both Hspin and H st

pv under
the symmetry Θ, deﬁned as the product of T reversal by a rotation of π around
the unit vector ˆu = ~E
, the rotation R(ˆu, π). It should be stressed that
the rotation R(ˆu, π) and the symmetry Θ considered here are quantum mechanical
transformations acting only on the spin states. The external ﬁelds are considered as
real c
numbers and are not aﬀected. One sees immediately that Hspin is invariant
under the symmetry Θ = T R(ˆu, π), while H st
pv changes sign. We conclude that, in
order to suppress the linear Stark shift cancellation we have to break the Θ symmetry.
This symmetry breaking can be achieved, for instance, by perturbing the atomic
S1/2 state with a crystal ﬁeld compatible with uniaxial symmetry along the unit vector
~n. A practical realization looks feasible, since it has been demonstrated that Cs atoms
can be trapped in a solid matrix of helium having an hexagonal symmetry [23] (see
also section 3). In this case the alkali S state is perturbed by the Hamiltonian6:

where both λb and ρ = r/a0 are expressed in atomic units. The perturbed atomic
state is now a mixture of S and D states, with no component of the orbital angular
momentum along the ~n axis. The spin Hamiltonian is modiﬁed and an anisotropic
hyperﬁne interaction is induced by the D state admixture. The new spin Hamiltonian
reads:

From this expression, it is clearly apparent that the linear shift breaks space reﬂexion
symmetry but preserves time reversal invariance. It diﬀers from the P and T violating
linear Stark shift arising from an electron EDM by the fact that it cancels out when
the quadrupolar anisotropy of the ground state vanishes. It is also obvious from Eq.
(29) that, in the strong ﬁeld limit, the size of the Stark shift depends only on the
orientation of ~B relative to ~E and ~n and not on the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld.

2.4 Analogy between this shift and the PV energy shift searched for in enantiomer

molecules

We would like to stress that from the point of view of symmetry considerations there
exists a close analogy between the linear Stark shift induced by the anapole moment
and the energy shift which is searched for in enantiomer molecules [24]. Indeed in
the present conﬁguration the three vectors ~E, ~B and ~n which are non-coplanar are
suﬃcient to place the atom in a chiral environment similar to that experienced by an
atomic nucleus inside a chiral molecule. Between two mirror-image environments an
energy diﬀerence is predicted exactly like between two mirror-image molecules.

Experimental considerations and order of magnitude estimate

We now consider an experimental situation which looks like a possible candidate for
the observation of the linear Stark shift discussed in the previous sections. It has been
demonstrated experimentally [25] that cesium atoms can be trapped in solid matrices
of 4He. At low pressures, solid helium cristallizes in an isotropic body-centered cubic
(bcc) phase, but also in a uniaxial hexagonal close packed (hcp) phase. Optically
detected magnetic resonance has proved to be a sensitive tool for investigating the
symmetry of the trapping sites. The group of A. Weis has reported the observation
in the hexagonal phase of zero-ﬁeld magnetic resonance spectra and magnetic dipole-
forbidden transitions which they interpret in terms of a quadrupolar distorsion of the
atomic bubbles [26]. Particularly relevant here is their observation of the matrix-
induced lifting of the Zeeman degeneracies in zero ﬁeld. This is attributed to the
combined eﬀect of two interactions, the quadrupolar interaction of the form Hb(~n) =
λb
between the cesium atom and the He matrix on the one hand,
and the hyperﬁne interaction in the Cs atom on the other.

(~ρ
(cid:16)
Provided that ~F 2 is still a good quantum number, it is easily shown from general
symmetry considerations, that the anisotropy of the hyperﬁne interaction induced by
the (hcp) crystal potential can be represented, within a given hyperﬁne multiplet, by
the eﬀective perturbation:

A⊥)/8 .

In a uniaxial crystal, when the atoms are optically polarized along the crystal axis in
the absence of external magnetic ﬁelds, the lifting of the degeneracy between Zeeman
sublevels induced by Hef f should make it possible to drive magnetic resonance tran-
sitions between these levels. One would expect to deduce the hyperﬁne anisotropy
from the observed spectra. At ﬁrst sight, the zero-ﬁeld magnetic resonance spectra
observed by Weis et al. would seem to match this prediction. However, their ex-
periment has been performed in a polycristalline (hcp) sample. The eﬀects observed
in this situation result from averaging over the distribution of the microcrystal axes.
For each microcrystal, there exists a quantization axis, ˆz, which diagonalizes the hy-
perﬁne level density matrix. Immediately a question arises as to the direction of the
quantization axis ˆz with respect to the microcrystal symmetry axis ~n. If the popu-
lation diﬀerences resulted, say, from the Boltzmann factor, then ˆz would be along ~n,
since in the zero magnetic ﬁeld limit there is no other preferred direction. In such

16

a situation, there would be no diﬀerence between the spectra for a polycrystal and
a monocrystal. But in the experimental situation considered here, the population
diﬀerences are induced by an optical pumping mechanism which provides a second
preferred direction: the direction of the photon angular momentum along ~k. The
microcrystal density matrix is then expected to keep some memory of the direction
of ~k. So, two directions ~n and ~k compete in the determination of the quantization
axis ˆz. To proceed further, we consider the extreme case where ˆz is taken along ~k,
together with an assumed isotropic distribution of microcrystal axes. It is then easily
seen that the lines associated with the hyperﬁne anisotropy Hef f collapse into a single
asymmetric line when the average is performed over the polycrystal. Clearly, one at
least of the two preceeding assumptions is too drastic, most likely the isotropy of the
~n distribution. It is indeed likely that the optical pumping process is more eﬃcient
for microcrystals having a preferred orientation with respect to the photon angular
momentum. Such a selection mechanism would then lead to an eﬀective anisotropic
distribution of ~n, and in this way a spectrum of separated lines can be recovered.
From the above qualitative considerations, it clearly follows that the ﬁnal interpreta-
tion of the the zero-ﬁeld resonances requires a detailed analysis of the optical pumping
process for Cs atoms trapped inside deformed bubbles of arbitrary orientation. The
corresponding theoretical investigation is currently underway in A. Weis’s group.

Meanwhile, to plan any experiment, we still need to know about the physical origin
and the magnitude of the ratio Ak−A⊥
, which governs the magnitude of the electroweak
Ak+A⊥
linear Stark shift. We are going to present now the result of an investigation which
has led us both to a physical understanding and a reasonably accurate estimate of
the sought after parameter. We have chosen to devote an appendix to a detailed
description of our semi-empirical approach, which consists in relating the hyperﬁne
anisotropy to another measured physical quantity. Here we shall give a brief summary
of our procedure and present the ﬁnal result.

We start from the remark that there really does exist a mechanism able to generate
an hyperﬁne anisotropy to ﬁrst order in the “bubble” Hamiltonian Hb(~n). The nD3/2
state is indeed mixed to the 6S1/2 state under the eﬀect of Hb(~n), and we note then
that the hyperﬁne interaction has non-zero oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements between S1/2
n ′D3/2i
and D3/2 states. In fact, it has been shown previously [27] that the
matrix elements are not easy to calculate, because they are dominated by the con-
tribution coming from many-body eﬀects, due to the existence of an approximate
selection rule which suppresses the single particle matrix element. However, as we

using the approximation scheme sketched above. Its absolute value is found to lie

For observing the electroweak linear Stark shift discussed in the present paper, it
is important to work with a uniaxial hexagonal crystal. Indeed, in a polycristalline
phase, where the individual crystals are oriented totally at random, the average value
taken over the isotropic distribution of ˆn is expected to be
of the pseudoscalar
suppressed and thus is the Stark shift computed in the previous section. Although
trapping of cesium atoms has not yet been achieved in a monocrystalline hexagonal
phase, the prospect does not look unfeasible [29] and a determination of the magni-
tude of the hyperﬁne anisotropy appears to be the ﬁrst step to be achieved. Using

Breaking the free atom symmetry by application of a nonresonant

radiation ﬁeld

In this last section we want just to mention another possibility for breaking the atomic
Hamiltonian rotation symmetry by other means than static uniform electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds. We have in mind the application of a strong nonresonant radiation ﬁeld
which generates an anisotropic electron gyromagnetic ratio.
In the presence of an
external magnetic ﬁeld ~B it has been shown [30] that the eﬀect of the nonresonant
radiation ﬁeld can be described by the introduction of an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld:

~B′ =

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where ˆn deﬁnes the direction of polarization of the radiation ﬁeld, g⊥ = gF and gk =
gF J0(ω1/ω), J0 is the zero-order Bessel function, and ω1 is the Rabi angular frequency
associated with the radiation ﬁeld. The above formula suggests the existence of a
uniaxial symmetry, but it is valid only within an atomic hyperﬁne multiplet. It is
clear that the “dressing” by a nonresonant radiation ﬁeld oﬀers new possibilities for
placing the atoms in a quadrupolar environment. However, it is important to bear in
mind that at least two stringent requirements must be satisﬁed if one wants to detect
an electroweak Stark shift in the ground state. First, the uniaxial perturbation has
to mix the two hyperﬁne substates, otherwise the matrix element of H st
pv cancels.
Second, it is imperative to avoid a broadening of the transition lines for allowing
precise frequency measurements. We are currently investigating how to achieve the
proper conditions in a realistic way.

Conclusion

This paper investigates a way to get around the well known no-go theorem:
no linear Stark shift can be observed in a stationary atomic state unless T reversal
invariance is broken.

The perturbation of an atom by the nuclear spin-dependent parity-odd potential
generated by the nuclear anople moment leads to a static electric dipole moment
~I, which clearly is T-even. However, if one considers an atom placed in arbitrarily
dI ~s
∧
oriented electric and magnetic uniform static ﬁelds ~B0 and ~E0, the quantum average
~E0 is
~E0 · h
is found to vanish. This can be understood by noting that ~s
~s
odd under the quantum symmetry transformation Θ deﬁned as the product of the
time reﬂexion T by a space rotation of π about an axis normal to a plane parallel to
the ﬁelds ~B0, ~E0, while the atomic hamiltonian stays even. Our strategy to obtain a
linear Stark shift is to break the Θ symmetry while keeping T invariance.

·

As a possible practical realization of such a situation, we have studied the case of
ground state Cs atoms trapped in a uniaxial (hcp) phase of solid 4He, which has been

19

recently the subject of detailed spectroscopic studies [26]. The required breaking of
space rotation is provided by the uniaxal crystal ﬁeld. As a result of the deformation
of the atomic spatial wave function the hyperﬁne interaction acquires an anisotropic
part, which plays an essential role in the determination of the size of the linear Stark
shift. We have performed a numerical estimation of the hyperﬁne anisotropy, believed
to be accurate to the 20% level, using a semi-empirical method. We use as an input
7S1/2
the recent experimental measurement of the E2 amplitude of the 6S1/2 →
transition induced in cesium by the hyperﬁne interaction. We arrive in this way at a
numerical evaluation of the linear Stark shift induced by the nuclear anapole moment:
the expected eﬀect is found to be about three times the experimental upper limit to
be set on the T-odd Stark shift of free Cs atoms for improving the present limit on
the electron EDM.

Besides the obvious remark that the T-even Stark shift studied here could be
a possible source of systematic uncertainty in EDM experiments designed to reach
unprecedented sensitivity[31, 21, 32, 33], we believe that there are strong physical
motivations for measuring the Stark shift itself. First, it would lead to a direct
measurement of the nuclear anapole moment in absence of any contribution coming
from the dominant PV potential due to the weak nuclear charge. It would also provide
an evidence for a truly static manifestation of the electroweak interaction, something
which is still lacking. Second, this experiment would rely on the measurement of
frequency shifts rather than transition amplitudes. While transition probabilities are
diﬃcult to measure very accurately, high precision measurements of frequency shifts
have already been achieved.

atoms trapped inside a 4He hexagonal matrix

In this appendix we present our evaluation of the hyperﬁne structure anisotropy Ak−A⊥
Ak+A⊥
resulting from the matrix induced bubble deformation of quadrupolar symmetry, a
quantity frequently referred to in this paper.

1. Two processes induced by hyperﬁne mixing

Our approach is based on the fact that hyperﬁne mixing plays quite similar roles
7S quadrupolar
in two diﬀerent processes. The ﬁrst process concerns the Cs 6S
transition amplitude in zero electric ﬁeld while the second process deals with the
parameter Ak−A⊥

The second physical process to be analysed in this section is not at ﬁrst sight
closely connected but happens to be described by the same formalism. This will allow
us to establish a very useful connection between measurements coming from rather
diﬀerent experimental situations. Recently optical pumping has been observed with
cesium atoms trapped inside an hexagonal matrix of solid helium [26]. Among the
new eﬀects to be expected, we have seen earlier in this paper that the existence of an
anisotropic hyperﬁne structure opens the possiblity of observing a linear Stark shift
induced by the nuclear anapole moment, an eﬀect which cannot exist for an atom in
a spherically symmetric environment. It is known that in the bubble enclosing the

As a consequence, the axially symmetric crystal potential inside the bubble can be

We present now the basic formulas which allow the computation of the parameters
relevant for the two physical problems in hand. They will be given in such a way as
to exhibit their close anology. We have chosen to use the Dirac equation formalism.
Besides the fact that formulas are more compact, it is well known that relativistic
corrections play an important role in cesium hyperﬁne structure computation. Ne-
glecting the contribution of the quadrupole nuclear moment of the Cs nucleus9, the
hyperﬁne hamiltonian is written as:

To obtain an estimate of the ratio (Ak −

A⊥)/a3(7, 6) it is convenient to introduce
the cartesian tensor operator Ti1i2i3(E). This object appears naturally in the lowest-
order pertubation expressions for the quantities of interest:

Ti1i2i3(E) =

Ai1 G+

3/2(E) (ρi2ρi3 −

δi2,i3 ρ2) ,

1
3

where the indices i1 , i2 , i3 take any value between 1 and 3. The scalar operator
G+
3/2(E) is the atomic Green function operator restricted to the subspace of D3/2
conﬁgurations (total atomic angular momentum J=3/2 and positive parity). We now
proceed to isolate in Ti1i2i3(E) the part transforming as a vector; this is the only part
to survive after the operator is sandwiched between the projectors P (n′S1/2) and
P (nS1/2). This operation is achieved by a decomposition of Ti1i2i3(E) into a traceless
tensor ¯Ti1i2i3(E) and a remainder [36]:

Ti1i2i3(E) = ¯Ti1i2i3(E) +

(δi1,i2 Tααi3(E) + δi1,i3 Tααi2(E))

−

δi2,i3 Tααi1(E) ,

where we have used the fact that Tααi = Tαiα and Tiαα = 0. It is a simple matter
to verify from the above equation that we have indeed ¯Tααi3 = ¯Tαi2α = ¯Ti1αα = 0.
The fully symmetric part of the traceless tensor ¯T S
i1i2i3(E) is easily identiﬁed with
an octupole spherical tensor having seven independant components. By a simple
counting argument, the left over term is seen to have ﬁve components; it is to be
identiﬁed with the quadrupole tensor which appears in the full decomposition of
Ti1i2i3(E) into irreducible representations of the rotation group O(3). Let us have a
look at the vector operator, ~V , the components of which appear in the right hand
side of Eq.(A.8):

where Ef and Ei are respectively the binding energies of the n′S1/2 and nS1/2 atomic
states. The second line of the above equation follows directly from the Wigner-Eckart
theorem applied to a vector operator.

23

In order to calculate a3(n′, n) we have to perform the contraction of Ii1ǫi2ki3 with

the tensor:

Fi1i2i3 = P (n′S1/2) (Ti1i2i3(Ef ) + (h.c., Ef →
Using Eq.(A8) and (A9) , Fi1i2i3 can be cast into the simple form :

The expression (A.12) looks to us a good starting point for numerical evaluation
A⊥: besides the fact that several sources of uncertainties in the evaluation
of Ak −
of γ(n′, n) are eliminated in the ratio γ(n,n)
γ(n′,n), it lends itself to the use of empirical
information. One may note, here, a certain similarity with Eq. (7) of sec 1.2 used for
the evaluation of the permanent dipole, dI.

2. Numerical evaluation

We proceed now to a numerical evaluation of Ak −
formula (A.12).

The second step is the numerical estimate of the ratio γ(6, 6)/γ(7, 6). This is
more delicate and requires an assumption which has been shown to work in similar
situations. To begin with, we have addressed the question12 of the origin and size of
the variations of the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements
with the radial
quantum numbers n and n′′. It is of interest to remind that a very precise answer to
this question has been already obtained in the case of cesium single particle matrix
with L = 0 or 1 and with n and n′ referring to the radial
elements
quantum numbers of any pair of valence states. For simplicity, we are going to express
the answer within a non-relativistic formalism, but it should be borne in mind that
all of what is said holds true within a relativistic framework.
It is convenient to
introduce the notion of overline matrix elements such as those computed with radial
wave functions Rnlj(ρ) which have a starting coeﬃcient at the origin equal to unity
instead of a unit norm13. More explicitly we can write:

n′′D3/2i

(14)

where Anlj = limρ→0 ρ−lRnlj(ρ) is the starting coeﬃcient of the space normalized
wave function.
(In the relativistic case the above condition is replaced by energy
independent boundary conditions imposed on the Dirac radial wave functions at the
nuclear radius). It was found in references [27, 37] that the overlined matrix elements
are independent of the valence orbital radial quantum numbers n and n′ to better than
10−4 for S1/2 states and better than 10−3 for P1/2 states. This result is understood by
noting that, in the domain of the ρ values relevant for the evalutation of the matrix
elements of ~α∧~ρ
for S1/2 and P1/2 states, the potential energy is larger than valence
ρ3
binding energies by more than three orders of magnitude. This implies that, in this
domain, the overlined radial wave functions have no dependence upon the binding
energy or equivalently upon the radial quantum numbers of the valence orbitals.

n′′D3/2i
the more diﬃcult case of the S-D oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements
.
The corresponding parameter δ(1)
S1/2 is expected to be somewhat larger in absolute
value, due to the fact that the relevant 5p orbital is less tightly bound than the 5s
orbital which gives the dominant contribution to the S1/2 diagonal matrix element.
The relative variation versus the D3/2 energy is expected to be on the order of few
units, since the centrigugal barrier is three times higher than in the case of P states.
This expectation is borne out by a preliminary estimate which gives δ(1)

We proceed now to a numerical evaluation of the ratio ranis = γ(6, 6)/γ(7, 6),
leaving, for the moment, δS1/2 and δD3/2 as free parameters. As an intermediate step,

An explicit numerical computation of ranis has been performed according to the

In formula (17), we have dropped, according to the above prescription, the zero

. Equation (A.18)
follows from a result obtained in [16], where the Fermi-Segr´e formula was extended
to arbitrary orbital angular momentum states. For simplicity we have ignored for
simplicity a factor involving the derivative of the quantum defects, which in the
present context would introduce few percent corrections.

The negative sign of ranis can be traced back to the fact that the 7S1/2 level lies just
in between 5D3/2 and 6D3/2 levels. If we adopt the rough estimate given above : a
δD3/2, the ﬁrst-order energy correction
few tens of % for
remains well below the 10% level, due in part to a cancellation between the two
correcting terms. To reduce the absolute value of ranis by more than 10% would

The ﬁnal step in our evaluation of the hfs anisotropy is devoted to the empirical
determination of the coupling constant λb appearing in front of the crystal electronic
potential. As experimental input we are going to use the hyperﬁne energy shift which
is observed for trapped cesium atoms, when one passes from the cubic to the hexagonal
phase. This shift is attributed to the eﬀect of the anisotropic bubble potential Hb(~n).
We shall ignore, for the moment, the possible contribution of the anisotropic hyperﬁne
interaction H anis
and assume that the shift is essentially due to the renormalization
of the 6S1/2 component of the atomic wave function by the admixtures αnD3/2 of the
nD3/2 states. The corresponding variation of the hyperﬁne splitting δW is then given
by :

As a ﬁnal topic, we should discuss the eﬀect of the anisotropic hyperﬁne interaction
itself on the the empirical splitting δW , since this could modify the value of
λb|
and so play a role in the assessment of the uncertainty aﬀecting the result given by
Eq. (A.24). Due to this eﬀect, the constant λb is no longer given by Eq. (A.22)
but rather by a second order equation where the linear term is associated with the
anisotropic hyperﬁne interaction. It is convenient to introduce the variable x = λb/λ0
b
with λ0
JSD W ). The equation giving λb takes then the simple form:

The superscript (0) indicates that the hf anisotropy is given, up to a well deﬁned sign,
by Eq. (A.24). The symbol ∆F means that one should take the diﬀerence between
the two hyperﬁne states of the quantum average over which it is applied. To obtain
an over-estimate of b we have assumed that optical pumping works at its maximum

28

eﬃciency so that the microwave transition takes place between the hyperﬁne levels
(4,4) and (3,3). In this case we obtain b = 0.20 and the two possible solutions for λb
are :

λ(±)
b =

The actual experimental situation is expected to lie far from the extreme case consid-
ered here, so the diﬀerence between the two absolute values is certainly smaller than
the upper limit given by the above calculation.

In conclusion, including all sources of uncertainties, we consider our evaluation
10−3, as reliable within uncertainty limits of about
of Eq.(A.24),
20%. However, if, during hyperﬁne shift measurements ~n is not aligned along the
quantization axis, the central value of λb, and therefore that of Ak−A⊥
, may be pushed
Ak+A⊥
upwards.

Formulas are derived for the coupled quadrupolar and monopolar oscillations of a fermion conden-
sate trapped in a axially symmetric harmonic potential. We consider two-component condensates
with a large particle-particle scattering length and in the limits of frequencies either small (adia-
batic) or large (diabatic) compared to the pairing gap. Using the method of coordinate scaling,
we reproduce Stringari’s results for adiabatic excitations and present new results for the diabatic
limit. Unlike the adiabatic oscillations, the diabatic ones show sensitivity to the interaction between
particles.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Experimental techniques in atomic cooling and trapping have now evolved to a point where condensates of fermionic
atoms such as 6Li can be produced and studied [1]. One of the interesting measurable properties is the spectrum of
collective excitations. Stringari [2] has investigated this question for the case of the unitary limit of a two-component
system. By “unitary” is meant that the scattering length associated with the two-body interaction is large compared
to all other scales in system. In ref. [2] it is assumed that the system behaves hydrodynamically. This requires the
dynamics to maintain an isotropic pressure tensor when the system is deformed. The condition for this adiabatic limit
to apply to fermion systems is that they be superﬂuid and that the collective oscillation frequency be much less than
the pairing gap. The other extreme, the diabatic limit, obtains if the oscillation frequency is much greater than the
pairing gap. This in fact is the case for the giant resonances in nuclear spectroscopy. In that limit, the dynamics is
governed by the mean ﬁeld acting on the particle orbitals and coupling through the ordinary density. We believe it is
of interest to investigate this limit for the atomic condensates as well, to understand the dependence of the frequencies
on all possible parameters of the system.

The time-dependent mean-ﬁeld theory may solved in the small-amplitude limit by the RPA equations, but inclusion
of all the single-particle degrees of freedoms requires a considerable numerical eﬀort. This is especially the case for the
theory including the pairing degrees of freedom as well[3, 4]. Much simpler analytic formulas can be derived under
the assumption that the excitations are fully collective, meaning that they exhaust the sum rule for some one-body
ﬁeld. In the sum rule approach, the formulas express the oscillation frequency in terms of a ratio of two integrals
involving only ground-state quantities in the integrands. Again referring to the experience in nuclear physics, this
approach has been very successful, particularly with the monopole and quadrupole modes of oscillation.

Considering atomic condensates in an axially symmetric harmonic trap, it is natural to consider compressional and
quadrupolar modes generated by the ﬁelds Q = x2, y2, and z2. These ﬁelds induce scaling transformations on the
orbital wave functions, e.g., for the ﬁeld x2, the transformed wave function is [6]

φ(x, y, z) → eβx[H,x

]/2φ = e

−βx/2φ(e

−βxx, y, z)

where βx is a scaling coordinate. The collective frequencies may be calculated by constructing the energy function in
the scaling coordinates and solving the classical equation of motion. This route is rather transparent and we follow it
in the derivation below. Consider an energy function of the form

where T is the kinetic energy operator, U is the interaction energy, and Vext is the trap ﬁeld. We write the trap ﬁeld
as

E = T + Vext + U

Vext =

x2 + y2 + (λz)2

We next evaluate the various terms in the energy as a function of the scaling variables. The expectation of the external
potential is given by

d3rρ0x2/2. The kinetic energy may vary in two diﬀerent ways, depending
where the prefactor a is the integral a =
on whether or not the Fermi surface remains spherical under the dynamic evolution. In the adiabatic limit we have

We next turn to the potential energy. It behaves very simply in the unitary limit, being proportional to the adiabatic
kinetic energy with a universal constant of proportionality. We shall further assume that the potential energy behave
as a scalar, creating an isotropic pressure. It thus depends only on hT iad. We parameterize it as

We may now calculate the vibrations in a harmonic approximation making a second-order Taylor expansion of the

energy function of the collective variables. The restoring force constants are given by the hessian matrix K, with

We will also need the inertia tensor I associated the collective variables. Deﬁning the velocity ﬁeld ~v = ~β∇Q/2, the
element Iij is the coeﬃcient of ˙βi ˙βj in the expression

d3rρ0v · v. In our case the integral is

Note that the integral is essentially identical to that for hVexti. Thus

Before applying the formulas for the diabatic frequencies, we conﬁrm previous results on the adiabatic frequencies[2,
5]. Here we use eq. (8) for the kinetic energy and eq. (10) for the interaction energy, i.e. setting hEi = ξhT iad in
eq. (11). We also use the fact that ~β = 0 in equilibrium to eliminate the coeﬃcient b in the expression for the kinetic
energy. The equilibrium condition

This agrees ref. [2] as well as the frequencies calculated for noninteracting fermions in ref. [5]. To get more insight into
the physics, let us specialize to the case of a spherical trap (λ = 1). The frequencies become ω2
1 = 4, corresponding
to the monopole vibration and ω2

2,3 = 2, corresponding to two of the ﬁve degenerate quadrupolar vibrations1.

Next we carry out the same calculation using the diabatic energy. The self-consistency condition eq. (15) together

with the strong-coupling relation eq. (10) determines the internal energy function to be

1 = 4 and ω2

The frequencies in eq. (20) depend on the interaction constant ξ, in contrast to the adiabatic frequencies. Their
measurement would thus provide information about the adiabaticity and thus about the relative size of the pairing
gap and the vibrational frequency. As a ﬁnal remark, let us specialize again to the spherical trap. The frequencies
become ω2
2,3 = 2 + 2/ξ. The monopole frequency ω1 is the same as in the adiabatic formula, which
is not surprising because the Fermi surface remains spherical under the compression by the monopole scaling ﬁeld.
The quadrupole modes depend on the interaction and lie above the monopole at the physical value of ξ, calculated
to be ξ ≈ 0.44 with pairing and ξ ≈ 0.55 without pairing [9]. This is completely at variance which the behavior of
the quadrupole mode in other systems such as atomic nuclei, where the incompressibility of the medium produces a
higher monopole frequency.

1 It is amusing to note that the diabatic harmonic formula for the the giant nuclear quadrupole resonance is also reduced from the nominal
value of ω2 = 4 by a factor of two[7, 8]. In both cases, the ﬂow is incompressible so that the co-moving density remains the same during
the oscillation. In the nuclear case with a short-range interaction, this implies a vanishing interaction contribution to the restoring force
constant, leaving a kinetic contribution. The situation is converse for the trapped fermion case: here the kinetic contribution vanishes
leaving only the interaction with the external ﬁeld.

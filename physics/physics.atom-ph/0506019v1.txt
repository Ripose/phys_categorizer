as well as quadrupole moment for the H atom and the equilibrium distances of the molecular

ions in strong magnetic ﬁelds > 109 G are proposed. The idea of approximation is based on the

assumption that the dynamics of the one-electron Coulomb system in a strong magnetic ﬁeld is

governed by the ratio of transverse to longitudinal sizes of the electronic cloud.

The behavior of Coulomb systems in a strong magnetic ﬁeld has always attracted a lot

of attention. This was justiﬁed by the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds in astrophysics

(neutron stars and white dwarfs [26]), as well as in plasma and semiconductor physics.

In particular, for many years it has existed a question about the content of the neutron

star atmosphere. Since the seminal papers by Kadomtsev-Kudriavtsev [1] and Ruderman

[2] it was believed that the neutron star atmosphere subject to a strong magnetic ﬁeld is

made from atomic-molecular compounds. However, in order to construct a model of the

atmosphere it is necessary to explore matter and its properties in a strong magnetic ﬁeld.

Recently, it was discovered that the interplay of Coulomb and magnetic forces for B &

1011 G leads to a new physics: new bound one-electron Coulomb systems appear like the

exotic molecular ions H++

3

[3], (HeH)++ and He3+
2

[4]. These Coulomb systems do not

exist without magnetic ﬁeld. All of them are characterized by very large binding energies

growing with magnetic ﬁeld. For all magnetic ﬁelds, where the non-relativistic considerations

are justiﬁed (B < 4.414

1013 G), of one-electron atomic-molecular systems the hydrogen

×

atom - the only neutral system- is characterized by the highest (!)

total energy, being

correspondingly the least bound system [5]. At the same time it seems natural to assume

that more-than-one-electron Coulomb systems in a strong magnetic ﬁeld are not strongly

bound (if bound) due to the fact that all electron spins should be parallel, being antiparallel

to the magnetic ﬁeld direction.

All one-electron molecular systems have a certain common feature. Their optimal con-

ﬁguration is always a conﬁguration where all massive charged centers are situated on a

magnetic line. We call it parallel conﬁguration. Only these conﬁgurations are considered in

the present article.

It is well known that studies in a strong magnetic ﬁeld are very complicated for several

reasons. Perhaps, the most serious, conceptual reason is related to the fact that the bound

states are of a weakly-bound-state nature (the binding energies are much smaller than the

total ones). The perturbation theory in powers of B is fast divergent and thus cannot be

used. Asymptotic expansions at B =

have extremely complicated form but, usually,

have no domain of applicability inside non-relativistic considerations. For example, it can

be easily checked that at an extremely strong magnetic ﬁeld near the edge of applicability of

non-relativistic approximation B = 10000 a.u.(= 2.35

1013 G) [27], the ionization energy

where Eb is given in atomic units as well as B (see [6]). Another example is given by the
ratio of the binding energies of H+

. Asymptotically, for B tending to inﬁnity,

2 and H++

3

this ratio should be 1/2.25 . However, the numerical results at B = 3

1013 G [5] give

×

1 for this ratio. Therefore the only methods which can be used are either numerical

≈
or variational. For B & 1011 G, to the best our knowledge, the numerical methods were

used for the hydrogen atom only (see, for example, the excellent early review [7], the book

[8] and recent review articles [9, 10]). Usually, these methods are very slow-convergent

and extremely diﬃcult to implement. The most popular method to study one-electron

molecular systems is the variational method (for review, see [11]). However, the use of the

variational method is associated with a diﬃcult procedure of minimization and, sometimes,

with numerical calculation of multidimensional integrals with high accuracy, which can also

be quite cumbersome.

In any case, the calculations are made for some particular values

of magnetic ﬁeld.

It seems natural to create some approximate expressions valid for all

magnetic ﬁelds, even having not high accuracy, in order to make at least rough estimates.

The accurate results of calculations of diﬀerent quantities for low-lying states reveal a

smooth, simple-looking behavior with rather slow changes with magnetic ﬁeld. However, a

straightforward attempt to construct approximations either fails or leads to quite compli-

cated expressions, at least, at ﬁrst sight (see, e.g., [12, 13]). Physical intuition gives a feeling

that there must exist a certain qualitative technique, for example a type of semi-classical

approximation providing an approximate qualitative description of these results. So far it

is not clear how such a technique can be approached. A goal of this paper is to consider a

certain simple alternative to this unclear-how-to-approach technique - to build approxima-

tions of the main characteristics of the one-electron atomic-molecular systems in a constant

uniform magnetic ﬁeld in their lowest state, such as total and binding energies, equilibrium

distances, electron cloud sizes, quadrupole moment, by following simple physical arguments.

Our basic assumption is that the physics is mainly governed by a single parameter: the ratio

of the transverse to longitudinal size of the electron cloud. Of course, in dimensionful quan-

tities such as equilibrium distances or quadrupole moment the transverse and longitudinal

sizes should appear explicitly but only in a form of parameters which carry a dimension.

Hereafter we denote the transverse size of the electron cloud as rt, and the longitudinal size

3

as rl.

As always we consider the one-electron Coulomb systems with inﬁnitely-heavy charged

centers, protons and/or α-particles (the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of the zero order)

situated on the z-axis[28]. If these charged centers are of the same charge, they are assumed

to be identical. Although we use the word ’proton’ it implies that in the Born-Oppenheimer

approximation it can be deuteron or triton. The magnetic ﬁeld of strength B is directed
along the z axis, ~B = (0, 0, B). Throughout the paper rydberg (Ry) is used as the energy

unit. For the magnetic ﬁeld we use either atomic units or Gauss (G) with the conversion

factor B0 = 1 a.u. = 2.35

109 G. For the other quantities standard atomic units are used.

×

The distances between inﬁnitely-heavy charged centers are denoted by R letters, whereas the

distances between centers and electron are denoted by r letters. The distance between the

electron position and the z axis is denoted by ρ. In particular, the potential corresponding

to the hydrogen atom is given by

between the most-distant charged centers, which is Leq = Req for the two-center case of
H+

2 and Leq = R+eq +R−eq for three-center case of H++

I. THE H-ATOM

Let us take hydrogen atom - the simplest one-electron system - placed in a constant

uniform magnetic ﬁeld B directed along the z-axis. Due to the Lorentz force, the spherical

symmetric electron cloud (in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld) is deformed to a cigar-like

form. The size of the electron cloud rt in transversal direction to z-axis shrinks drastically

B−1/2 at large magnetic ﬁelds, being close the value of the Larmor radius. As to the

∼
longitudinal size rl it also contracts at large magnetic ﬁelds but at a much more moderate
(log B)−1 (see, e.g., [2, 14, 15]). An interplay of these two types of behavior explains

rate,

∼

the cigar-type form of the electron cloud. At very large magnetic ﬁelds, the cigar-type

form evolves to a needle-like form known as the Ruderman needle.

In Fig. 1a the form

of the electron cloud is illustrated for B = 1012 G [29].

In particular, the longitudinal

size of the electron cloud shrinks in comparison with the zero-magnetic-ﬁeld case about

four times. Therefore, the apparent classical (electrostatic) appearance of the magnetic

ﬁeld inﬂuence is characterized by a change of the form of the electron cloud, which can be

roughly approximated by the ratio of two classical parameters rt, rl. In fact, it is the major

assumption of the present approximation scheme. We also assume that these parameters

rt, rl are deﬁned by the expectation values,

rt ≡

< ρ > , rl ≡

2 <

z

|

|

> .

(4)

If a deﬁnition of the transversal size rt looks natural from the physical point of view and

rather unambiguous, deﬁnition (4) of the longitudinal size is not so obvious. It can be chosen

as

√< z2 >, or as a linear combination of <

> and √< z2 >. So far it is not so clear

z

|

|

∼

what would be physical arguments which allow to specify a deﬁnition. Eventually, it turns

out it is not very important what quantity is used to deﬁne rl. The results of the ﬁt remain

very similar although there can be some diﬀerence in the parameters.

The binding energy Eb is by deﬁnition the diﬀerence between the energy of free electron

in magnetic ﬁeld (the Larmor energy) B and the total energy of the atom, Eb = B

ET. It

is known that Eb in the weak-ﬁeld regime is represented by the Taylor expansion in powers

where r0

t , αt, at, bt are parameters, which are found by ﬁtting the calculated expectation

correct perturbative expansion of < ρ > at B = 0 (in powers B2) and r0

values for < ρ >. The formula (6) is written in such a way as to reproduce a functionally-
t = √2aB, where
B−1/2

aB = 1 a.u. is the Bohr radius. At large B the right-hand side of Eq.(6) behaves as

∼

simulating the Larmor radius behavior.

In Fig. 2 one can see that Eq.(6) ﬁts data on < ρ > calculated using the formalism developed

in [12] with accuracy better than one percent at B & 109 G. The parameters of the ﬁt are

given in Table I. The parameter r0
t

is also found from the ﬁt, it deviates from √2 (see

above) by

8%. It reﬂects the fact that the accuracy provided by formula (6) diminishes

≃

as the magnetic ﬁeld decreases (see the discussion below).

At ﬁrst sight, it is a much more complicated task to describe the longitudinal size,

II. THE H+

MOLECULAR ION

In this Section we consider the molecular ion H+

2 in parallel conﬁguration, when the

protons are situated along the magnetic line. The form of the electron cloud is illustrated

in Fig. 1b for the magnetic ﬁeld B = 1012 G. The transversal size of the electron cloud rt
B−1/2, at large magnetic ﬁelds, being close to the value of the Larmor

shrinks drastically,

radius similarly to what happens for the hydrogen atom. As to the longitudinal size rl it
(log B)−1. In particular, the longitudinal size of

also shrinks but at a much slower rate

∼

the electron cloud shrinks in comparison with vanishing magnetic ﬁeld about ﬁve times (see

Fig. 1b).

Following the same arguments which were used earlier for the H atom, we again assume

that the dynamic characteristics of the H+

2 in a magnetic ﬁeld depend on the expectation

values of transversal (rt) and longitudinal (rl) sizes. The dependence of them on magnetic

ﬁeld is approximated by similar formulas (6)-(7). The binding energy at equilibrium distance

between protons depends on the ratio

= rt/rl. Eventually, the binding energy is written

in the same form (8) with the same expressions (6) and (7) as is done for H atom but with

Now we consider the exotic system H++

theoretically predicted in [3], which is made out

of three protons situated along the magnetic line and one electron (parallel conﬁguration).

This system appears as a quasi-stationary state at B & 1010 G [20]. The form of the electron

cloud for B = 1012 G is shown in Fig. 1c. It is clearly seen that the transversal size of the

electron cloud rt shrinks drastically,

H-atom and H+

for rt, rl are obtained using a strategy described in [20]. The parameters of the ﬁt are given

in Tables I- II. The ﬁt of rt and rl is illustrated in Figs. 11- 12. Fig. 13 demonstrates the

CONCLUSION

In this work we presented a phenomenological model of the behavior of diﬀerent one-

electron atomic-molecular systems in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The model is based on a

surprisingly simple physical idea that the ground state depends on a ratio of transverse

to longitudinal size of a system placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld only. Since accurate

numerical studies in a strong magnetic ﬁeld are very tedious from a technical point of view a

construction of a phenomenological model which provides approximate expressions for basic

characteristics of a system for any value of a magnetic ﬁeld strength can be quite useful for

applications.

One of the motivations of the present work is related to the fact that the neutron star

atmosphere is characterized by strong magnetic ﬁelds, 1012

1013 G. It seems natural to

−

anticipate a wealth of new physical phenomena there. However, for many years the ob-

servational data did not indicate anything unusual, corresponding to the black-body radi-

ation. On 2002, the CHANDRA X-ray observatory collected data on an isolated neutron

star 1E1207.4-5209 which led to the discovery of two clearly-seen absorption features at

0.7 keV and

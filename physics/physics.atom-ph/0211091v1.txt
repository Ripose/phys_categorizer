Coherent backscattering (CBS) of quasi-resonant light by cold atoms presents some speciﬁc fea-
tures due to the internal structure of the atomic scatterers. We present the ﬁrst quantitative
comparison between the experimentally observed CBS cones and Monte-Carlo calculations which
take into account the shape of the atomic cloud as well as the internal atomic structure.

When light is elastically scattered oﬀ an optically thick
disordered medium, the interference between all partial
waves produces strong angular ﬂuctuations of the in-
tensity distribution (speckle pattern). Averaging over
the positions of the scatterers washes out interferences
and produces a smooth reﬂected diﬀuse intensity, ex-
cept around backscattering where it is enhanced. This
coherent backscattering eﬀect (CBS), originates from a
two-wave interference, namely the interference between
waves traveling along the same scattering paths but in
reverse order [1, 2]. This interference is constructive at
exact backscattering and only survives, after averaging,
in a narrow angular range ∆θ
1/kℓ around it (k is the
light wave-number and ℓ the scattering mean free path).
The CBS enhancement factor measures the ratio of the
maximum intensity (measured at backscattering) to the
background intensity measured at angles θ
1/kℓ. Be-
cause it originates from a two-wave interference, the en-
hancement factor is bounded by 2.

For vector waves like light, either linear or circular po-
larization can be considered. This leads to four diﬀerent
lin
polarization channels in scattering experiments: lin
where both the incoming and outgoing photons are lin-
lin where they
early polarized along the same axes, lin
are linearly polarized along orthogonal axes, h
h where
they are both circularly polarized with the same helic-
ity (because they propagate in opposite directions, they
h where they are
have opposite polarizations) and h
circularly polarized with opposite helicities, i.e.
same
polarization.

For spherically-symmetric scatterers (and hence for
point-dipole scatterers) and in the h
h channel the CBS
enhancement factor is equal to 2 [3] because the following
conditions are met: (i) All scattering paths have a dis-
tinct reverse counterpart; (ii) The two paths in each pair
contribute with the same amplitude and phase, so that
a maximum interference contrast is guaranteed. Condi-
tion (i) is not true for single scattering paths which thus
do not contribute to CBS. In general, this implies an en-
hancement factor slightly smaller than 2. However, for
spherically-symmetric scatterers, there is no single scat-

h channels. Condition (ii) is met in the parallel
and h
channels h
lin as a general consequence of
reciprocity [4] (which is equivalent to time-reversal sym-
metry in the absence of absorption). Therefore, an en-
hancement factor much smaller than 2 has only been ob-
served in the perpendicular channels or by breaking the
reciprocity with the help of an external magnetic ﬁeld [5].
The recent experimental observation of CBS of light
by an optically thick sample of laser-cooled Rubidium
atoms [6, 7] reported – in all channels – surprisingly small
enhancement factors, typically between 1.05 and 1.2. A
qualitative explanation of the experimental results in the
double scattering picture has been given in [7, 8, 9]. The
Rubidium atoms, being much smaller than the optical
wavelength, are point-scatterers, but do not behave like
classical dipoles: the atomic Zeeman internal structure
leads to a violation of the previous conditions for a per-
fect CBS enhancement. Condition (i) is not met because
single scattering is present in all polarization channels,
due to transitions between diﬀerent atomic sub-states.
Condition (ii) is not met because the amplitudes asso-
ciated with the direct and reverse scattering path are in
general not equal. This imbalance of the amplitudes re-
duces the interference contrast, and leads to a CBS cone
much smaller than for point-dipole scatterers.

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst extensive compari-
son between the experimentally measured enhancement
factors and CBS cone shapes (in all four polarization
channels) and a theoretical calculation which takes into
account the two most important ingredients of the ex-
periment: the atomic internal structure and the peculiar
shape of the scattering medium, an approximately spher-
ical cloud of cold atoms produced in a magneto-optical
trap (MOT).

The experimental setup is described in detail in [7].

The numerical calculation of the CBS cone takes into
account the internal structure of the atom. Since all
possible hyperﬁne dipole transitions for the D2 line are
well separated on the scale of the line-width Γ, we only
consider quasi-resonant light scattering induced by the
above-mentioned closed hyperﬁne transition. We indeed
expect it to give the dominant contribution to scattering
F ′ = 3 lies 20 Γ away).
(the nearest transition F = 3
Note however that the contribution of other transitions is
currently under investigation [10]. When an atom scat-
ters the incoming light, it may stay in the same Zeeman
sub-level — this is a Rayleigh transition — or change its
magnetic quantum number — this is a degenerate Ra-
man transition. In both cases, at weak laser intensities
and if recoil and Doppler eﬀects are negligible (which
one expects to be the case for our cold atomic cloud),
the scattered photon has the same frequency than the
incoming photon: the scattering is elastic. The scatter-
ing amplitude by a single atom depends on the initial and
ﬁnal Zeeman sub-levels, on the scattering direction and
on the incident and scattered polarizations [9]. As the
atoms produced in a MOT are not in well-deﬁned inter-
nal states, but rather in a statistical mixture of Zeeman
states, the calculation of the CBS cone requires, in addi-
tion to the usual position averaging, an averaging over the
possible internal ground-states of the atom. We choose
to perform the average over the positions of the scatter-
ers with a Monte-Carlo method and to use an internal
analytical average by employing the average atomic scat-
tering vertex [9, 11]. The details of the method are given
in [12]. The essential assumption is that all Zeeman sub-
levels in the ground-state are equally populated, without
any coherence between sub-levels. This is a reasonable
assumption provided no optical pumping takes place in
the medium (see discussion below). Our Monte-Carlo
method is ﬂexible, as it makes it possible to compute
the CBS cone for an arbitrary spatial repartition of the
scatterers. Furthermore, it allows us to take into ac-
count some rather small, yet not negligible eﬀects, such
as the non-uniform incoming intensity sent on the sam-
ple (because a Gaussian laser beam and diaphragms are
used).

spherical cloud of cold Rubidium atoms (optical thickness 26)

ization channels. The CBS cones have been angularly aver-
aged in order to improve the signal/noise ratio. The solid lines
are the theoretical predictions of a Monte-Carlo calculation
taking into account the internal atomic structure, the shape
of the scattering medium, and the geometry of the incoming
laser beam. All the parameters are experimentally measured,
so that there is no adjustable parameter. The shapes and

including the wings of the cones and details like the small
angular width in the h k h channel.

the medium, shape and dimensions of the atomic cloud,
geometrical properties of the incoming laser beam) have
been experimentally measured which means that the CBS
cones that we calculate have no adjustable parameter.

Figure 1 shows the CBS cones recorded for an atomic
cloud of optical thickness b = √2πr0/ℓ = 26 in the

four polarization channels, compared with the cones com-
puted using our Monte-Carlo method (r0 is the rms-
radius of the atomic cloud along the z-axis). The plotted
cones are an angular average of the 2D images recorded
on the CCD. This data processing improves the signal-
to-noise ratio at the expense of smearing out any angular
anisotropies, either due to the scattering itself or to the
shape of the scattering medium. In the circular polariza-
tion channels, this proves to be safe since the recorded
cones are isotropic (although the scattering medium it-
self has not a perfect cylindrical symmetry around the
probe propagation axis).
lin channel, the
cone shape is anisotropic (roughly an elliptical shape,
see table I) and the widths are diﬀerent along the di-
rection of the incoming polarization and perpendicular
to it [13].
lin channel, the CBS cone has
a four-fold symmetry [13] and two diﬀerent widths can
be measured, either along one of the polarization axes or
at 45◦ from it. The FWHM angular widths have been
measured in the various conﬁgurations and are displayed
in table I, together with the result of the Monte-Carlo
calculation.

For the enhancement factor, the most dramatic eﬀect
of the atomic internal structure, already noticed in the
ﬁrst experimental results [6, 7] is that the “best” chan-
nel for point-dipole scatterers (h
h) is the worst one
for the atomic scatterers. Conversely, the worst chan-
h) is the best one
nel for point-dipole scatterers (h
for atomic scatterers. This has been already established
in [8] and further justiﬁed in [9] by carefully analyzing
the atomic scattering vertex. But as a consequence of
the approximations done (analysis limited to single and
double scattering in a semi-inﬁnite medium with con-
stant atomic density), the CBS cone computed in [8] had
only roughly the correct angular width (and the mean
free path had to be adjusted) while its shape was not in
excellent agreement with the experimental result, espe-
cially in the wings. Moreover, the enhancement factors
were only fairly well reproduced by the calculation.

The present agreement is much more satisfactory be-
cause it takes into account both higher-order scattering
and the geometrical eﬀects induced by the peculiar shape
of the medium. The cone shapes are very well repro-
duced as well as the angular widths. Note that the wings
of the cones are well reproduced and that non-trivial de-
tails such as the fact that the CBS cone is signiﬁcantly
narrower in the h
h one are
also well predicted by our calculation. This is a strong
evidence that our theoretical approach catches the most
important aspects of multiple scattering of light by cold
atoms. It also indicates that most of the experimental
parameters are under control.

However, there are small diﬀerences for the angular
widths, at most 0.15 mrad, which is a statistically sig-

In ﬁg. 2, we show, for the parameters of ﬁg. 1, the
contributions of the various orders of scattering to the
background and the CBS cone peak value. The quan-
tities are easily extracted from the Monte-Carlo calcu-
lation. One can make several observations. Firstly, the
background contributions decrease rather slowly with the
scattering order N. For a semi-inﬁnite medium, the stan-
dard diﬀusion approximation predicts that it decreases
like N −3/2 in excellent agreement with our numerical ob-
servation [14]. At very large order, the ﬁnite size of the
medium implies a faster decrease (very long scattering
paths unavoidably escape the medium), but this eﬀect in
negligible for orders lower than few tens. On the contrary,
the contributions to the CBS cone decrease exponentially

with N. In the case of the F = 3
theory [15, 16] predicts a decay like N −3/2
(19/40)N
in excellent agreement with our numerical results. This
unambiguously proves that, for atoms with a degenerate
ground-state, the CBS eﬀect is mainly dominated by low-
order scattering and the properties of the atomic scatter-
ing vertex. This also explains why the CBS cone com-
puted in [8] gives a reasonable estimate of the enhance-
ment factor. Indeed, single and double scattering con-
tribute to roughly 57% of the background and 68% of the
CBS cone. Forgetting higher orders is thus a rather good

Figure 2: Contributions of the successive multiple scattering
orders to the smooth background and to the CBS cone peak
value, in the experimental conditions of ﬁg. 1 in the h ⊥ h
channel. All contributions are normalized such that the to-
tal background is unity. The single scattering contribution
(background only) is the strongest one, 42.6% of the total. In
the upper plot (linear scale), one can see the slow decrease of
the contributions to the background, which shows that we are
indeed in the multiple scattering regime. The CBS contribu-
tions decrease very rapidly, which indicates that low orders
of scattering are the essential contributions. On a logarith-
mic scale (lower plot), one clearly sees that the contributions
to the background decrease algebraically with the scattering
order N , roughly following the prediction of the diﬀusion ap-
−3/2 (dashed line). This proves that the
proximation ∝ N
ﬁnite geometry, which cuts the very long scattering paths, is
not crucial here. The CBS contributions decrease exponen-
tially with N, in excellent agreement with the analytic predic-
tion using the properties of the atomic scattering vertex [16]

approximation, even if the medium is optically thick.

In order to understand the small discrepancy in the en-
hancement factors, we calculate the enhancement factor
as a function of the optical thickness, in the four po-
larization channels, using the experimentally measured
parameters. The result is shown in ﬁg. 3, together with
the four experimental points measured at optical thick-
ness b = 26. It is clear that in this regime the computed
enhancement factor depends only weakly on the optical
thickness. This is because the CBS cone is mainly due
to low order multiple scattering, which takes place in the
external layers of the atomic cloud (on the side of the in-
coming laser beam), and is thus only weakly sensitive to
the deep layers and the optical thickness. Complemen-
tary calculations [12] also prove that the enhancement
factor – contrary to the angular width – is not very sen-
sitive to the detailed shape of the medium.

The relative strength of the four CBS cones is well re-

We are not completely sure of the reason of such a
small discrepancy. We are inclined to attribute it to a
non-uniform distribution of the atomic state over the var-
ious Zeeman sub-levels. Even after the trapping beams
and the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT are switched oﬀ, it
may remain some polarization of the atomic ground state.
Another possibility – more likely in our opinion – is that
the CBS probe beam, although weak, induces some op-
tical pumping. This eﬀect is diﬃcult to estimate in op-
tically thick media, because the atoms are exposed not
only to the incoming beam but also to the light scat-
tered by other atoms. The importance of optical pump-
ing seems to be supported by preliminary experimental
results which suggest that the discrepancy between the
calculation and the experiment is reduced when the num-
ber of exchanged photons is decreased.

To summarize, we have presented in this paper the
ﬁrst comparison between experimentally observed CBS
cones on a could of cold atoms and Monte-Carlo sim-
ulations including the atomic internal structure and the
peculiar sample geometry, without any adjustable param-
eter. The agreement is very good for the cone shapes and
angular widths, as well as for the enhancement factor.

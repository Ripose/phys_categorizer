Abstract
This work presents a method for the ab initio calculation of isotope shift in atoms and ions with
one valence electron above closed shells. As a zero approximation we use relativistic Hartree-Fock
and then calculate correlation corrections. The main motivation for developing the method comes
from the need to analyse whether diﬀerent isotope abundances in early universe can contribute
to the observed anomalies in quasar absorption spectra. The current best explanation for these
anomalies is the assumption that the ﬁne structure constant α was smaller at early epoch. We test
the isotope shift method by comparing the calculated and experimental isotope shift for the alkali
and alkali-like atoms Na, MgII, K, CaII and BaII. The agreement is found to be good. We then
calculate the isotope shift for some astronomically relevant transitions in SiII and SiIV, MgII, ZnII
and GeII.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies of quasar absorption spectra reveal a possible change in α since the early
universe [1]. One of the possible major sources of systematic eﬀects in these studies is that
the isotopic abundance ratios in gas clouds in the early universe could be diﬀerent to those
on Earth. This may provide an alternative explanation for the observed variation in spectra
[2]. In order to test this possibility it is necessary to have accurate values for the isotope
shift (IS) for the relevant atomic transitions. Experimental data is available for only a very
few of them. Therefore, accurate calculations are needed to make the most comprehensive
analysis possible.

Another motivation for accurate isotope shift calculations comes from the possibility to
use isotope shift to study atomic nuclei. Comparing calculated and measured IS allows one
to ﬁnd the change in nuclear charge distribution from one isotope to another. Studying IS for
these purposes has long history, for a good review and tables see e.g. [3] or for more recent
values in many atoms and ions [4]. However any progress in the accuracy of calculations is
of signiﬁcant importance.

Isotope shift is also important in searching for small, charged black holes. The mass deﬁcit
of the observable universe (dark matter) may be explained by supposing the existence of
non-vanishing “elementary” black holes of the Planck mass. Such black holes may have
an electric charge, giving rise to the possibility of an atom made from electrons orbiting
a positively charged black hole instead of a nucleus. Such black hole atoms would have
spectra shifted with respect to usual nuclear atoms due to the eﬀectively inﬁnite mass and
zero volume of the nucleus [5]. This shift is simply an extreme example of the regular isotope
shift, and can be calculated using the method described in this paper. A search for these
spectra would verify the existence of elementary black holes, or any other stable, very heavy
particles, e.g. “strange matter”.

In this paper, we develop a method for calculating the isotopic shift of atoms and ions
that can be treated as a single electron above a closed shell core. These include the alkali
metals, as well as other atoms and ions such as ZnII that are fairly well approximated by a
single electron above a closed subshell core.

We test our technique by calculating IS for light alkaline atoms as well as for a relatively
heavy ion, BaII. Since diﬀerent contributions dominate in light and heavy atoms and good
agreement with experiment has been obtained in both cases, one can conﬁdently say that
the technique has been reliably tested. We then apply the technique to calculate isotope
shift for astronomically relevant transitions in MgII, ZnII, GeII, SiII and SiIV.

II. METHOD

The isotope shifts of atomic transition frequencies come from two sources:

the ﬁ-
nite size of the nuclear charge distribution (the “volume” or “ﬁeld” shift), and the ﬁ-
nite mass of the nucleus (see, e.g.
[6]). The energy shift due to recoil of the nucleus is
(1/2M)p2
N = (1/2M)(Σpi)2. Furthermore this “mass shift” is traditionally divided into
the normal mass shift and the speciﬁc mass shift (SMS). The normal mass shift is given by
the operator (1/2M)Σp2
i , which is easily calculated from the transition frequency. The SMS
operator is (1/M)Σi<jpi · pj which is diﬃcult to evaluate accurately.

The shift in energy of any transition in an isotope with mass number A′ with respect to

an isotope with mass number A can be expressed as

δνA′,A = (kN M S + kSM S)

+ F δhr2iA′,A ,

and hr2i is the mean square nuclear radius. In this paper we develop a method for calculating
the speciﬁc mass shift and ﬁeld shift constants, kSM S and F respectively. It is worth noting
that in this paper we use the convention δνA′,A = νA′

− νA.

To determine spectral shifts in black hole atoms relative to normal atoms, one must take

A′ → ∞, and because the black hole has eﬀectively zero volume δhr2i = −hr2i = − 3

A. Speciﬁc mass shift

It is well known that calculations using many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) in the
residual Coulomb interaction give very poor convergence for atoms with many electrons.
Therefore all order techniques were developed in earlier works to calculate energy levels,
transition amplitudes, etc. (see, e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10]). It is natural to expect that an all order
technique is needed for the isotope shift as well. In the recent work by Safronova and Johnson
(Ref. [11]) the SMS was calculated to third order of MBPT. Their results verify that there
is very poor convergence for this operator. A ﬁrst or second order calculation cannot even
guarantee that the sign of the ﬁnal result will be correct. A third order calculation gives the
correct sign, however it is unknown how much fourth and higher order diagrams contribute.
Our method is to include the speciﬁc mass shift directly into an energy calculation from
the very beginning. The SMS is a two-body operator p1·p2 and can be added to the Coulomb
potential, ˜Q = 1
|r1−r2| + λp1 · p2 (see Appendix ). The operator ˜Q replaces the Coulomb
operator everywhere that it appears in an “all order” energy calculation that includes certain
chains of diagrams to all orders. We vary the isotope shift scaling factor λ and calculate the
level energies E. The gradient of an E vs. λ graph then gives us the SMS matrix element,
usually denoted kSM S.

As a zero approximation we use relativistic Hartree-Fock (Hartree-Fock-Dirac) method.
At the Hartree-Fock stage we include the isotope shift with the exchange potential and iterate
to obtain self-consistent “dressed” wavefunctions. The SMS matrix element at this stage
is roughly equivalent to the ﬁrst-order and second-order contributions of the one-particle
operator, plus higher-order corrections from the random-phase approximation in Ref. [11]
(P (1) + S(2) in their notation). It is interesting to note that kSM S at this stage does not give
meaningful results, and can even be of the wrong sign (it is labelled as “HF” in Table I).
We need to include correlation corrections in order to obtain any reasonable accuracy.

We include correlation eﬀects to second order of MBPT; this approach gives good accu-
racy for energies. The perturbation is the diﬀerence between the exact and Hartree-Fock
Hamiltonians V = H − HHF. The many-body corrections start in second order; all ﬁrst
order diagrams have been included in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock procedure. There are
just four second order diagrams, illustrated for example in Ref. [7]. However now we replace
the Coulomb operator in these diagrams with our two body operator ˜Q, and use dressed

Hartree-Fock wavefunctions as described above. This gives our ﬁnal value of kSM S as listed
in Table I.

An estimate of the size of neglected higher order diagrams can be obtained by calculating
a new value of kSM S that includes some higher order chains of diagrams. We create an
operator Σ for the second order correlation eﬀects in each partial wave, deﬁned by

δE(2)

n = hn|Σ|ni .

(3)

This “sigma” operator is then added to the exchange potential in the Hartree-Fock Hamilto-
nian for the valence electron, ˜H = HHF + Σ. Thus we calculate the single electron Brueckner
orbital. We also include a scaling factor, f , with this sigma operator (Σ → f Σ) in order to
ﬁt the experimental energy. The rescaling of Σ simulates some higher order correlation cor-
rections that were omitted in our calculation. Including Σ in our Hartree-Fock calculation
allows us to obtain another value for kSM S, and the diﬀerence between this new value and
the old second-order value gives us an estimate of the error.

In Table I we compare our results to those obtained by Safronova and Johnson (Ref. [11])
who calculated the isotope shift to third order in standard MBPT. Our values are signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent, in particular the MgII 3s level shift is more than twice that given in Ref. [11]
and also [12], which are broadly in agreement with each other. However we ﬁnd that this
diﬀerence is not so large in the 3p − 3s transition due to cancellations of higher order terms
between the two levels. We compare our ﬁnal results and those of Ref. [11] with experiment
in Table II. Agreement is at the level of 1%, which is much smaller than our error estimates.
Our method includes many-body diagrams that are diﬀerent to Ref. [11], including some
chains of diagrams in all orders. It is also arguably simpler to implement since it doesn’t
require term-by-term calculation of a large number of matrix elements.

B. Field shift

Our method for calculating the ﬁeld shift (also called the volume shift) is similar to that
used for the SMS calculation. We add a perturbation due to the ﬁeld shift to the nuclear
potential, and then calculate the energy directly. The ﬁeld shift potential is

δU(r) = λ ( U(R + δR, r) − U(R, r) )

athese values are extracted from IS experiments in Table VI

where R is the nuclear radius and U(R, r) is the nuclear potential. To obtain the change
in energy of a state due to the ﬁeld shift, we add this potential to the nuclear potential in
our Hartree-Fock calculations. By introducing a scaling factor λ we can check linearity and
increase the size of the eﬀect. To calculate the ﬁeld shift constant, we take the gradient of
a level energy E vs. λ graph and extract F as

Note that the ﬁeld shift constant, F , is deﬁned here as having opposite sign to the deﬁnition
in some previous papers, e.g. Ref. [11] and [13]. This equation assumes that the nuclear
charge distribution can be approximated as a uniformly charged sphere of radius R.

Higher order correlation eﬀects are smaller in the ﬁeld shift than in the speciﬁc mass
shift, and are localised at the nucleus. We can include them easily by creating Brueckner
orbitals (solutions of the modiﬁed Hamiltonian, H = HHF + Σ) using a second order sigma
operator, deﬁned in Equation 3. The ﬁeld shift is proportional in ﬁrst order to the square
of the wavefunction at the nucleus. Hence we can include higher order eﬀects quite simply
by multiplying the matrix element by the square of the ratio of the Brueckner wavefunction
to the Hartree-Fock wavefunction at the nucleus,

We tested this in BaII, as well as in lighter atoms, because in barium the ﬁeld shift
dominates over the mass shift, and there is a lot of experimental data to compare with.
Our results for ﬁeld shift constants in BaII were found to be consistent within a few percent
of the previous theoretical work by M˚artensson-Pendrill (Table III).
In the same paper,
Ref. [13], they say that they have underestimated the 6p1/2 ﬁeld shift constant by around 7%,
based on the diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical calculations of the hyperﬁne
A constant. Also, their 6s constant is said to be overestimated, leading to a corrected value
of F6p3/2−6s = −4.20(13) GHz/fm2. These corrected values are in better agreement with the
ab initio values obtained in this work (F6p3/2−6s = −4.076 GHz/fm2).

Using King plots [14] we can extract the ratios of ﬁeld shift constants for diﬀerent transi-
tions, provided we have experimental data for a number of diﬀerent isotopes. In Table V we
compare our calculated values of these ratios with those obtained by combining the data in
several diﬀerent experiments and transitions. Our values were found to be consistent with
this experiment to within 5%. We have used a simple weighted least squares ﬁt to obtain an

C. Alkaline ions

We compare our results with experimental data for alkaline ions in Table VI. In alka-
line ions it is more valuable to compare only the speciﬁc mass shift with those extracted
from experiment, than to compare the entire isotope shift. This is because the mass shift
dominates strongly in these ions, and also because the SMS is generally considered more
diﬃcult to calculate. We have removed the ﬁeld shift and the normal mass shift from the
experimental values of the isotopic shift in order to obtain an experimental value for the
speciﬁc mass shift. The ﬁeld shift values used in Table VI were calculated using the above
method. While our calculation of F has been shown to be good, the ﬁeld shift also depends
on having knowledge of δhr2i for the relevant isotopes.

For Na we use the value quoted in Ref. [11] of δhr2i23,22 = 0.205(3) fm2. This value
is only from an empirical ﬁt, and shouldn’t be trusted too far. The ﬁeld shift is very
small in this atom, so the errors don’t matter too much. For MgII we have the used value
δhr2i26,24 = 0.55 fm2 from another empirical ﬁt, the equation Rnuc = 1.1A1/3 fm. This is very
poor, but in this case the ﬁeld shift is small even in relation to the error in the experimental
isotope shift. In Table VI we have not included an error contribution for the ﬁeld shift in

either of these atoms, since we really don’t know how accurate these approximations are.

The values of δhr2i are known for K and CaII from muonic x-ray experiments, allowing
us to calculate the ﬁeld shift much more accurately. This is fortunate because the SMS is
relatively small for the p − s transitions in these atoms, and hence the ﬁeld shift plays a
much larger role. We use the values δhr2i41,39 = 0.117(40) fm2 for K from Ref. [29], and
δhr2i43,40 = 0.1254(32) fm2 for CaII from Ref. [30].
In CaII the change in mean square
nuclear radius is given to high precision, so we have included an additional error of 5% in
the ﬁeld shift that comes from the constant F . This is a pessimistic estimate of error based
on the accuracy we achieved calculating F for transitions in BaII.

Table VI shows that our method can reliably calculate the isotope shift in alkaline atoms,

including those transitions with a large speciﬁc mass shift.

III. RESULTS

We have shown that our method works in atoms for which we have available experimental
data (Section II). In Table VII we tabulate values for the mass and ﬁeld shift constants for
some astronomically useful transitions. We have not given errors for F , however we can say
that they are less than 5% based on comparison of calculation with experiment in BaII.

In Table VIII we present the results of isotope shift calculations between common isotopes
of astronomically important ions. We have used the IS constants presented in Table VII with
Equation 1 in order to calculate the isotope shift between particular isotopes. Just before
submission of this paper, results of measurements for ZnII were brought to our attention
[31]. These results matched our prediction extremely well.

In GeII and SiII, the speciﬁc mass shift cancels the normal mass shift entirely, making
the ﬁeld shift, and hence δhr2i, important. We have just used the empirical formula Rnuc =
1.1A1/3 fm2 to obtain values of δhr2i in these ions. This is extremely rough, and although
it seems to work in ZnII to within a 20% accuracy based on the experimental data given,
we really don’t know if this holds for Si and Ge at all. In the SiIV transitions presented,
it is less important to have good values for the ﬁeld shift because there is no cancellation
between the NMS and SMS.

TABLE VIII: Summary of isotope shift values for astronomically relevant alkali-like ions. The
experimental value for the 4p3/2 − 4s transition in ZnII is 676(6) MHz as quoted in [31]. We have
presented two errors, the ﬁrst is our uncertainty in kSM S and the second is the uncertainty in our
ﬁeld shift, which is mainly due to lack of knowledge of δhr2i. A negative shift means that the sign
is opposite to the normal mass shift.

We have presented a method for the calculation of the isotope shift in atoms and ions
that can be approximated as having one valence electron above a closed shell. Our results
are shown to be in good agreement with isotope shift experiments in both light and heavy
atoms, which are good tests for the mass shift and ﬁeld shift respectively.

We have used the method to predict values of the isotope shift in astronomically relevant
transitions in SiII and SiIV, MgII, ZnII and GeII. Recent experiments measured the isotope
shift of a p − s transition in ZnII, and the results were in excellent agreement with our
prediction. These values are needed in order to examine systematic eﬀects in observations
of spectral line shifts in quasar absorption spectra that suggest a variation in α [2]. Our
calculations could help provide another explanation for the observed shifts, depending on
whether isotopic abundances were diﬀerent in gas clouds in the early universe. Alternatively,
our calculations may strengthen the arguments in support of a varying α.

Further work needs to be done in order to obtain the isotope shift for more complex
atoms with more than one electron in their outer shell. The general method of including
the isotope shift operator with the two-body Coulomb operator may be used in such cases,
although the energy calculation itself is more complicated.

APPENDIX: MATRIX ELEMENT OF THE TWO-BODY OPERATOR

The two-body operator used is this work is the sum of the Coulomb interaction operator

and the “rescaled” SMS operator (atomic units):

˜Q =

1
|r1 − r2|

+ λp1 · p2 ≡

˜Qk,

Xk

where λ is the scaling factor, p = −i∇ is electron momentum, and

˜Qk =

4π
2k + 1

rk

rk+1

Yk(n1)Yk(n2) + λ p1 · p2 δk1.

(A.2)

We use the following form for the single-electron wave function

ψ(r)jlm =

1
r  

f (r)Ω(n)jlm
iαg(r) ˜Ω(n)jlm !

.

Here α = 1/137.036 is the ﬁne structure constant, and ˜Ω(n)jlm = −(~σ · n)Ω(n)jlm.
The matrix element of operator (A.2) with wave functions (A.3) has the form

hψ1(r1)ψ2(r2)| ˜Qk|ψ3(r1)ψ4(r2)i = Ck(Rk − λP1δk1),

(A.4)

where the angular factor Ck is the same for both operators

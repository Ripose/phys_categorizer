Abstract

A transverse Zeeman slower composed of an array of compact discrete neodymium magnets is

considered. A simple and precise model of such a slower based on magnetic dipoles is developed.

The theory of a general Zeeman slower is modiﬁed to include spatial nonuniformity of the slowing

laser beam intensity due to its convergence and absorption by slowed atoms. The slower needs no

high currents or water cooling and the spatial distribution of its magnetic ﬁeld can be adjusted. In

addition the slower provides a possibility to cool the slowed atoms transversally along the whole

length of the slower. Such a slower would be ideal for transportable optical atomic clocks and their

future applications in space physics.

INTRODUCTION

The sources of slow atoms based on laser cooling of their translation degree of freedom

are widely used in many modern atomic physics experiments. At the present time a Zeeman

slower [1] is the most eﬃcient slower of that type. Recently a maximal ﬂux of cold Rb

atoms as high as 3.2

1012 at/s, produced by a Zeeman slower with an additional section

for the transverse laser cooling of atoms, has been demonstrated [2]. For some alkali atoms

like Rb and Cs a Zeeman slower can be substituted with more compact sources based on

magneto-optical traps [3, 4, 5], the typical ﬂux of which is between 109 and 1010 at/s. The

most intense source of that type based on two-dimensional magneto-optical trap is able

to produce the ﬂux of 6

1010 at/s [6]. On the other hand, for many other atoms and

×

×

experimental conditions a Zeeman slower is the only choice. A standard Zeeman slower uses

a special current-carrying coil to create a proper spatial distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld

along its axis, the purpose of which is to compensate a Doppler shift of the decelerated

atoms with a corresponding Zeeman shift.

An advantage of a Zeeman slower based on permanent magnets is that it does not need

high currents and corresponding cooling of its coils. The existent approach to such a per-

manent Zeeman slower consists in substitution of standard Zeeman coils with analogous

ring-like magnets made of plastic-bonded permanent magnets, which can be machined to

any form prior their magnetization. The disadvantage of these magnets is that they are

not as strong as dense magnets and their strength is subject to ﬂuctuations due to the

inconsistancy of the density of the magnetic material.

In this paper it is proposed to use an array of small neodymium magnets to create a

required magnetic ﬁeld distribution of a Zeeman slower. A simple model of the slower,

based on point-like magnetic dipoles is introduced. It is shown that this model works well

even for magnets of a size comparable to their distance from the axis of the slower. The

design of such a slower includes a possibility to vary the distances of the individual magnets

from the axis of the slower, which allows ﬁne tuning of the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the ﬁrst part of the paper the existent standard theory of a Zeeman slower is extended

to apply it to a cooling laser beam with a nonuniform distribution of its intensity along

the axis of the slower. It is shown how the absorption of the cooling light can be included

in calculation of the most optimal spatial distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld of the slower.

2

It is proposed in the case of a nonuniform laser ﬁeld to use instead of a standard design

parameter η a slightly diﬀerent parameter ǫ, which relates the designed local deceleration

of atoms to its maximum possible value at the same location at given laser intensity. It is

shown that the most optimal cooling of the decelerated atoms takes place at ǫ = 0.75.

In the ﬁrst section a numerical approach to the calculation of the most optimal spatial

distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld of a Zeeman slower is described for a general case of a

cooling laser beam with non-uniform intensity distribution. In the second section Zeeman

slowers based on permanent magnetic dipoles are discussed. In the outlook section the con-

struction of a transverse Zeeman slower based on neodymium magnets and its applications

are discussed. Finally, in the conclusion the main results are summarized.

II. GENERAL THEORY OF ZEEMAN SLOWER

In a Zeeman slower atoms are decelerated in a counterpropagating resonant laser beam

due to momentum transfer from spontaneously scattered photons. An existent analytical

theory of a Zeeman slower [7, 8] is based on uniform deceleration of atoms in a ﬁeld of a

laser beam with uniform intensity distribution.

In practice intensity of the slowing laser

beam is never uniform. There are several reasons for that. First, to increase an overlap of

the laser beam with the expanding atomic beam and to provide some additional transverse

cooling of the decelerated atoms, convergent laser beam is usually used. Second, absorption

of laser light by slowed atoms essentially changes the distribution of intensity of light along

the axis of a Zeeman slower.

Below a procedure of numerical calculation of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution of a Zeeman

slower is described for a general case of a slowing laser beam with non-uniform spatial

distribution of its intensity. To keep it simple, dependence of the light intensity along only

one of the coordinates z, which is the axis of a Zeeman slower, is considered.

The spontaneous light pressure force is given by

F (v, z) =

~kΓ
2

s0(z)
1 + s0(z) + 4[δ0 + kv

µ′B(z)/~]2/Γ2 ,

−

(1)

where k is the wave vector of light, s0(z) is the local on-resonance saturation parameter of

the atomic transition, Γ is the linewidth of the transition, δ0 is the laser frequency detuning,
v is the velocity of the atom, µ′ is the magnetic moment for the atomic transition and

3

B(z) is the local magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld. The velocity dependence of the force is
µ′B(z)/~, which includes

determined by the eﬀective frequency detuning ∆ef f = δ0 + kv

−

the Doppler shift kv of the atomic frequency. The maximum value of the local deceleration,

provided by the force, is achieved at exact resonance, when ∆ef f = 0, and is given by

amax(z) =

~kΓ
2m

s0(z)
1 + s0(z)

,

(2)

where m is the mass of the atom. Although the maximum deceleration can be used to

estimate the shortest possible length of a Zeeman slower, it has no practical meaning. At

exact resonance an equilibrium between the inertial force of the decelerated atoms and

the light force is unstable and any additional little increase of the atomic velocity due to

imperfection of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution or spontaneous heating of atoms will lead to

decrease of the decelerating force and subsequent loss of atoms from the deceleration process.

In practice the deceleration of atoms is realized at a fraction of the maximum deceleration

a(z) = ǫamax(z),

(3)

where ǫ < 1. Note that the coeﬃcient ǫ in our case corresponds to the ratio between the

reduced local acceleration and the maximum possible acceleration at the same location,

which is a function of the local saturation parameter s0(z). In a standard deﬁnition [7, 8] of

a similar coeﬃcient η, it relates the actual deceleration to the maximum possible deceleration

at inﬁnite intensity of laser light. The reduced deceleration (3) keeps the decelerated atoms

on the low-velocity wing of the Lorentz velocity proﬁle of the light force (1) and allows

their stable deceleration. The corresponding equilibrium velocity v(z) of the decelerated
atoms, which is reduced compared to the resonant velocity vres(z) = (µ′B(z)/~

δ0)/k, is

determined by

is achieved at a point where the derivative of the force (1) reaches its maximum, because

the damping of the relative motion of atoms around this point is maximal. It is easy to

show that within our deﬁnition of the ǫ coeﬃcient (3) this most optimal cooling condition is

achieved exactly at ǫ = 0.75. The damping coeﬃcient of the force decreases with the increas

of the intensity of the laser ﬁeld. Therefore, choosing of the most optimal intensity of the

cooling beam for a Zeeman slower is a compromise between having a large deceleleration

4

force and low velocity spread of the decelerated atoms. Usually the saturation parameter of

a Zeeman slower is chosen to be about 1.

The procedure of calculation of the spatial distribution of a Zeeman slower looks as

follows. First, the actual velocity of the slowing atoms is calculated numerically according

to the formula

dv(z)
dz

= ǫ

~kΓ
2m

s0(z)
1 + s0(z)

,

After that the resonant velocity can be determined from the eq. (4) and the corresponding

distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld calculated as

B(z) = ~(δ0 + kvres(z))/µ′.

(5)

(6)

The distribution of the saturation parameter s0(z) on the axis of the slower has to be taken

according to the convergence of the cooling laser beam and its absorption by the slowed

atoms. If the inﬂuence of the convergence of the laser beam to the spatial distribution of

the saturation parameter is easy to include, but the calculation of the absorption of light by

the decelerated atoms is not so straightforward. The problem of the propagation of atoms

and light through each other while they are mutually interacting is diﬃcult to solve. On

the other hand, it can be easily solved by inverting the direction of motion of the atoms and

calculating their acceleration along the laser beam, starting from the end edge of a Zeeman

slower. For atoms copropagating with the laser beam, the change of the atomic velocity,

which is responsible for the local density of atoms, and the change of the intensity of light

at each point inside the slower can be simultaneously computed from their values at the

preceding spatial step. The corresponding distribution of the saturation parameter along

the Zeeman slower can be found from the equation

dz∗ =

s0(z∗)n(z∗)

(7)

where z∗ = zf −
z is a coordinate along the direction of propagation of the laser beam, which
starts at the end point z = zf of the Zeeman slower, n(z∗) is the local density of atoms,

σ0 is the resonant light scattering cross section and l0 is the distance from the end edge of

the slower to the waist of the converged laser beam. The ﬁrst term in the right side of the

equation is responsible for the absorption of light and the second one for the convergence

of the laser beam. It is supposed that the focal plane of the laser beam is located outside

the slower, such as l0 is larger than its length. In this one-dimensional problem the density

5

means the number of atoms per unit length along the z-axis of the slower. The local density
of the slowed atoms at z∗ is given by

n(z∗) =

normalize the density to the total ﬂux of atoms. In this formula the density of atoms at the
location z∗ is determined by the integrated ﬂux of atoms between the velocities v(z∗) and
v0, which is divided by the local velocity of the slowed atoms v(z∗). The analytical solution

of the eq. (8) is given by

n(z∗) = A

This function predicts rapid increase of the density of the slowed atoms towards the end of
the slower, where the velocity v(z∗) becomes small, which was conﬁrmed experimentally in

[7, 9] by direct measurement of the ﬂuorescence of atoms inside a Zeeman slower.

As an example we will consider here a Zeeman slower for Sr atoms similar to one in [10],

where the 1S0 →
Γ = 2π
×

1 P1 transition of Sr with wavelength λ = 461 nm and natural linewidth

32 MHz is used for cooling of the translation motion of atoms. The slower is

designed to slow atoms from the initial velocity v0 = 420 m/s down to the ﬁnal velocity

25 m/s over a distance Ls = 25 cm with the eﬃciency parameter ǫ = 0.6. The value of the ǫ

parameter was chosen to be below its optimal value ǫ = 0.75 to include possible imperfection

of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution of the slower. The thermal velocity of the initial atomic
beam is taken to be u = 292 m/s, which corresponds to the temperature of T = 630 ◦C. For

the given capture velocity of the slower, the ﬂux of the slowed atoms is about 28% of the

total initial ﬂux of thermal atoms. The cooling laser beam is taken to be convergent, such

that its diameter at the output of the slower (z = zf = 25 cm) is d0 = 1 cm and at its input

(z = 0) d1 = 0.3 cm. This corresponds to the distance between the output end of the slower
and the waist of the laser beam of l0 = LsD0/(d0 −
at the end edge of the slower is set to be s0(zf ) = 1. The total absorption of the cooling light

d1) = 35.7 cm. The saturation parameter

in the slower was set to 50% of the total light power of the laser beam. Taking into account

that each decelerated atom absorbs in average about 22000 photons it is easy to derive that

absorption of 22.5 mW of laser power gives the total ﬂux of cold atoms about 2.4

1012 at/s,

×

6

which corresponds to the total initial ﬂux of the thermal atoms of 8.7

1012 at/s.

It is

×

assured here that there are no losses of the atoms during their deceleration and extraction

from the slower.

Figure 1 shows the calculated spatial distribution of the saturation parameter of the

atomic transition along the z-axis of the slower. The solid curve shows that the large

absorption of the slowing light at the end of Zeeman slower, where the density of the slowed

atoms reaches its maximum, leads to slight decrease of the saturation parameter, which can

not be compensated by the convergence of the laser beam. The dashed curve corresponds to

the case of absence of any absorption of the cooling light. Here the smaller initial saturation

parameter s0(zf ) = 0.58 is used to keep the capture velocity of the slower v0 = 420 m/s the

same. In the absence of absorption the saturation parameter is growing monotonically due

to convergence of the laser beam. Comparison of the derivatives of these curves shows that

the absorption takes place mostly in the end half of the Zeeman slower, which is explained

by higher density of atoms and lower saturation parameter at this part of the slower. Figure

2 shows the optimal spatial distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld along the Zeeman slower,

calculated from the formulas (1-8). The solid curve corresponds to the 50% absorption of

the laser beam and the other parameters as above. The dashed curve shows the case, when

the absorption is absent and the initial saturation parameter s0(zf ) = 0.58. The dotted

curve corresponds to a uniform deceleration of atoms in a laser beam of constant diameter

and constant saturation parameter s0(z) = 1.5 in absence of absorption.

III. ZEEMAN SLOWER BASED ON MAGNETIC DIPOLES

It is proposed to use a Zeeman slower based on a quasiperiodic array of small permanent

magnets as is shown in ﬁg. 3. These magnets can be modeled as point-like magnetic dipoles

(MD). There are two diﬀerent possible conﬁgurations of such a slower, the transverse, when

the dipoles are oriented perpendicularly to the axis of the slower (as in ﬁg. 3) or the longi-

tudinal one, when the dipoles are oriented along the axis and the resulted magnetic ﬁeld of

the slower is also directed along that axis.

To understand the basic diﬀerence between the two conﬁgurations, the ﬁeld of a single

magnetic dipole has to be considered ﬁrst. For a magnetic dipole placed at the origin of a

Cartesian system of coordinates and oriented along the x-axis, its magnetic ﬁeld is described

7

by the formulas

where r =

x2 + y2 + z2 and M is the magnetic moment of the dipole. Let us consider now

a distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld along the z-axis for a single MD placed at x = R, y =

p

0, z = 0, while it is oriented perpendicular or parallel to the z-axis. The corresponding

distributions of the proper components of magnetic ﬁeld are given by

For a symmetric distribution of the magnetic dipoles around the z-axis, all other components

of the magnetic ﬁeld at this axis are equal to zero. Figure 4 shows the corresponding

distributions of Bx(z) (solid line) and Bz(z) (dashed line) for a MD with magnetic moment

M = 1.86 Am2 and R = 3 cm.

For the perpendicular orientation of the MD, its ﬁeld along the z-axis is mostly of the

same sign, while for the parallel orientation (dashed line), the maximum amplitude of the

ﬁeld is twice smaller and its amplitude on the wings of the distribution, where the ﬁeld has

an opposite sign, is comparable to its maximum value. From the eq. (11) it follows that for

perpendicular MD its ﬁeld turns to zero at z = √2R, while for parallel orientation of the

MD it happens at z = R/√2. Therefore, the longitudinal conﬁguration of the slower is less

preferable, because it demands much stronger magnets with smaller spacing between them.

An additional problem of the longitudinal MD-Zeeman slower is that magnetic screening of

it leads to further decrease of its magnetic ﬁeld.

For an array of magnets the uniformity of the resultant magnetic ﬁeld depends on the

distances between the magnets. To study this, an inﬁnite periodic array of equidistant

(x =

R) pairs of transverse MD separated along z-axis by a constant interval dz has been

calculated. It was found that the relative amplitude of the ripples of the magnetic ﬁeld on

z-axis is about 1% for a spacing dz = 0.65R and it decreases rapidly with further decrease

±

of dz.

8

The schematics of the transverse MD-Zeeman slower for Sr atoms is shown in ﬁg. 3. It

is designed to produce a magnetic ﬁeld, which is changing its sign, as it is shown in ﬁg. 2.

The slower consists of n = 13 sections separated from each other by the same interval

dz = 2.083 cm. Each i-th section of the slower consists of two MD of the same direction

and placed symmetrically with respect to the z-axis at x =

In the ﬁrst 8 sections

xi.

±

the direction of the magnetic dipoles is opposite to the x-axis and for the last four sections

the dipoles are directed along the axis. The 9th section has no magnetic dipoles in it. To

produce the desired spatial distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld the transverse distances xi of

the magnetic dipoles have to be chosen properly. To ﬁnd the right distances of the magnetic

dipoles a system of nonlinear equations, which relates the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld

at n selected points on the z-axis of the slower to the sum of the partial magnetic ﬁelds

produced by n sections of the slower, can be solved. On the other hand, it was found that

the local ﬁeld of the slower at z = zi is mostly determined by the closest magnets of the i-th

section of the slower and it is easy to ﬁt the target value of the local ﬁeld by gradual change

of the corresponding pair of magnets.

An example of such a ﬁt is shown in ﬁg. 5. The solid curve shows the optimal magnetic

ﬁeld, which is the same as in ﬁg. 2. The dashed curve shows the computed ﬁeld produced

by a transverse MD-Zeeman slower, which consists of 13 equidistant section, 12 of which

include pairs of MD with magnetic moment M = 1.86 Am2. The dotted curve shows the

distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld of the slower surrounded by two ideal magnetic shields,

placed at z =

2 cm and z = 27.7 cm. To model the inﬂuence of the magnetic shields, the

−

images of the real magnets were added at proper distances from both sides of the slower.

As far as the images of the transverse magnetic dipoles have an opposite sign, the magnetic

shields should not be placed too close to the ends of the slower. It was found also that the

best ﬁt of the target ﬁeld distribution at the end of the slower, where it has maximal slope

steepness, is achieved when the step between the last two sections of the slower is increased

to 2.7 cm. Therefore, the axial position of the last section of the slower was taken to be

z13 = 25.7 cm. The corresponding most optimal distances of the MD from the z-axis are

shown in ﬁg. 6.

To calculate the magnetic ﬁeld distribution of the MD-Zeeman slower in the x0y-plane one

needs to take into account all three components of the magnetic ﬁeld Bx, By and Bz, which

deﬁne the total amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld B(x, y, z) =

B2

x + B2

y + B2

z responsible for

p

9

the local Zeeman shift of atomic magnetic states. The transverse variation of the ﬁeld is

the strongest at the input and output edges of Zeeman slower, where the distances of the

magnets from the axis of the slower are the smallest. The corresponding distributions of the

magnetic ﬁeld amplitude near the axis of symmetry of the slower along the x-axis (dashed

line) and the y-axis (solid line), taken at the output plane of the slower at z = 25.7 cm, are

shown in ﬁg. 7. In the central region of the slower, where the distances of the magnets from

the z-axes of the slower are larger, the transverse variation of the ﬁeld is much smaller.

The well known limit on the maximal slope steepness of the magnetic ﬁeld of a Zeeman

slower is given by the ratio

dB(z)
dz

<

~kamax(z)
µBv(z)

.

(12)

This formula is derived from the condition that the local deceleration rate a(z) can’t exceed

amax(z). This condition is true, but not complete. If the local deceleration rate a(z) exceeds

the maximum value amax(z), but only for a short period of time δt, the atoms can still be

further decelerated along the stable velocity-trajectory of a Zeeman slower. The maximal

duration of this time can be estimated from the ratio (a(z)

amax(z))δt = vres(z)

v(z),

−

−

which means that the exceeding acceleration should be able to accelerate an atom during

the time δt from its equilibrium velocity to the resonant velocity, at which atom is lost from

the further deceleration process. The dashed line in ﬁg. 8 shows the spatial distribution of

the accepted maximal local gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld, computed numerically from the

eq. 12 for a decelerated atom. The solid line represents the actual gradient of the magnetic

ﬁeld, produced by an array of magnetic dipoles of the MD-Zeeman slower.

The magnetic moment of a real magnet is determined as M = BiV /µ0, where Bi is

intrinsic induction and V is the total volume of the magnet. The value M = 1.86 Am2

in the examples considered above corresponds to a cylindrical neodymium magnet with

Bi = 1.1 T, diameter 1.5 cm and height 1.2 cm. Figure 9 shows a precise calculation of

the MD-Zeeman slower based on such ﬁnite-size magnets performed with the ﬁnite element

analysis software COMSOL. In these calculations the distances of the centers of the magnets

from the axis of the slower were taken exactly the same as in the MD model described above.

The positions of the iron magnetic shields were also the same as in ﬁg. 6.

10

IV. OUTLOOK

The mechanical construction of such a slower can be rather simple and inexpensive. It

can be a box made of iron or some other material of high magnetic permeability, which serves

as a frame for a two sets of screws with cylindrical magnets attached to their bottoms. The

box is used both for holding the screws and for magnetic screening of the slower. In such

a construction the distances of the individual magnets from the axis of the slower can be

adjusted by rotation of the corresponding screws, without changing their axial positions.

In the considered MD-Zeeman slower all the magnets of the same size were used.

In

practice it make sense to use in the centre of the slower smaller magnets placed closer to the

axis of the slower, which will make the whole construction more compact.

The maximum ﬂux of cold atoms produced by a Zeeman slower is usually decreased by a

transverse heating of the slowed atoms via the spontaneous scattering of the cooling light.

This heating can be partially compensated by introducing additional sections, where the

transverse motion of atoms is cooled down with additional transverse laser beams. This

makes possible to increase the total ﬂux of the cold atoms typically by one order of the

magnitude or more. Such a transverse cooling of the atoms can be performed before [2],

after [11] or in between the two sections [12] of a standard Zeeman coil magnet. The problem

is that the access to the atoms in the transverse direction is normally completely blocked

by the coils.

In a transverse MD-Zeeman slower the two arrays of compact magnets are

placed from the two sides of the atomic beam and it is easy to get access to it on the whole

length of the atomic beam. Therefore, for a MD-Zeeman slower it is possible to cool atoms

transversely along the whole length of the slower.

Finally, a few words on the operation of the transverse MD-Zeeman slower. A transverse

slower uses linearly polarized light, which can be presented as a linear superposition of two
(σ+ and σ−) circularly polarized components. Therefore, only one-half of the total light

intensity is in resonance with the right Zeeman transition of the decelerated atoms. An

additional complication arises when a Zeeman splitting of magnetic sublevels of the ground

state of an atom is comparable to the natural linewidth of the atomic transition. As it

was recently shown in [13], a transverse Zeeman slower for Rb atoms demands quite some

additional light power to make it work in the presence of the optical pumping between

the split magnetic sublevels of the ground state. Fortunately, the Zeeman splitting of the

11

ground state of the atoms from the earth-metal group is very small [14]. That is why such

a transverse MD-Zeeman slower is very promising for use in an optical atomic clock based

on such atoms.

V. CONCLUSION

A standard theory of a Zeeman slower is extended to a case of a nonuniform intensity

distribution of the cooling light. A way to include the absorption of the cooling light into the

calculation of the optimal magnetic ﬁeld of a Zeeman slower is described. It is shown that

in that case the numerical simulation of the acceleration of atoms starting from their ﬁnal

position in the slower and calculating in the backwards direction is preferable. A new design

parameter ǫ instead of the standard one η parameter is proposed. The main advantage of

such a deﬁnition is that the most optimal cooling of the decelerated atoms is reached at

exactly ǫ = 0.75.

A transverse Zeeman slower composed of an array of discrete compact magnets is proposed

and a simple model of such a slower is developed. As an example, a compact transverse

Zeeman slower for Sr atoms has been calculated in presence of 50% absorption of the cooling

light. The validity of the simple MD model of the slower for a slower composed of ﬁnite-size

magnets has been conﬁrmed with precise numerical calculations.

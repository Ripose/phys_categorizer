We present an investigation of the Xe2 excimer emission spectrum observed in the near infrared
range about 7800 cm−1 in pure Xe gas and in an Ar (90%) –Xe (10%) mixture and obtained by
exciting the gas with energetic electrons. The Franck–Condon simulation of the spectrum shape
suggests that emission stems from a bound–free molecular transition never studied before. The states
u state with 6p [1/2]0 atomic limit and the dissociative (1)0+
involved are assigned as the bound (3)0+
g
state with 6s [3/2]1 limit. Comparison with the spectrum simulated by using theoretical potentials
shows that the dissociative one does not reproduce correctly the spectrum features.

Luminescence of rare gas excimers is studied for appli-
cations in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) [1]. It is worth
recalling, for instance, the Xe–based high–energy particle
detectors, in which the VUV scintillation light produced
by the transit of an ionizing particle is detected [2]. Other
applications deal with the production of coherent and in-
coherent VUV light sources [3].

Xe is of great interest because of its importance as an
intense source of VUV radiation. Nearly all of the inves-
tigations on Xe excimers aim at explaining the processes
leading to the emission of the VUV 1st– and 2nd contin-
uum observed under diﬀerent experimental conditions in
gas excited by discharges [4], UV photons [5, 6], multi-
photons [7, 8], or high–energy particles [9, 10, 11, 12].

The 1st continuum at 152 nm is due to radiative tran-
sitions from the vibrationally excited (0+
u )v′≫0 state, cor-
related with the resonant atomic state 5p56s (3P1), to the
dissociative 0+
g ground state. The 2nd continuum at 170
nm consists of the overlapping bound–free emission from
the lowest vibrationally relaxed (0−
u , 1u) states correlated
with the metastable state 5p56s (3P2) [7, 12].

The two continua are thus produced by two diﬀerent
VUV emission processes whose kinetics accounts for the
observation that at low pressure (P < 2 · 104 Pa) lumis-
cence is due to the 1st continuum, whereas it consists of
the 2nd one for P > 5 · 104 Pa [13].

The excimer structure has been investigated theoreti-
cally with ab initio [14, 15] or model [16] calculations of
the molecular potentials and experimentally by analyzing
spectroscopic data [7, 10, 17, 18, 19].

Metastable atomic– and g molecular states are mainly
studied because of their importance for VUV emission
[20]. The kinetics of the processes leading to excimer for-
mation and VUV emission has been clariﬁed in spectral
and time resolved experiments, in which lifetimes and
rate constants are determined [1, 7, 11, 12, 13, 18, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

Actually, the possibility has been neglected that, in
this cascade of processes, molecular transitions occur
in the infrared (IR) range. Only an IR spectrum cen-

tered about 800 nm was observed and attributed to a
v′ ≫ 0
0+
g (6p[1/2]0) → 0+
means that the ﬁnal state is in a highly excited vibra-
tional state [8].

u (6s[3/2]1)v′≫0 transition.

No further measurements of IR emission can be found.
Their number might be so scanty because the poten-
tial minimum of higher–lying bound excimer states oc-
cur at an internuclear distance, at which the weakly
bound ground state potential is strongly repulsive, and
are not easily reached by multiphoton selective excita-
tion. By contrast, broad–band excitation using high–
energy charged particles [11] produces excited atoms with
such high kinetic energy that can collide at short distance
with ground state atoms yielding higher excimer states,
although there is no control on their parity.

Recently, we observed for the ﬁrst time a broad emis-
sion spectrum centered at λ ≈ 1.3 µm (˜ν ≈ 7860 cm−1)
in both pure Xe gas and in a Xe(10%)–Ar(90%) mixture
at room temperature by exciting the gas with a pulsed
beam of 70–keV electrons [27]. Details of the tecnique
can be found in literature. It is only worth recalling here
that we use a FT–IR spectrometer in stepscan mode. An
InGaAs photodiode with ﬂat responsivity in the range
(0.6 ≤ ˜ν ≤ 1.2) · 104 cm−1 is used as detector.

The FWHM of this band is Γ ≈ 900 cm−1 at P ≈ 2·104
Pa.
Its value relative to the central wave number ˜νm,
Γ/˜νm ≈ 0.115, is comparable with the value 0.116 for
the 2nd continuum [9, 28]. In the limit of low P, ˜νm and
Γ are the same both in the pure gas and in the mixture.
Without any further inquiries, as we were interested on
the excimer interaction with the high density environ-
ment [29], we attributed the emission to a Xe2 bound–
free transition between a state dissociating into the 5p56p
manifold and one of 5p56s conﬁguration [27].

Upon improving our experimental technique, espe-
cially using a LN2-cooled InSb photodiode detector, we
have been able to make high–resolution time–integrated
measurements of the excimer IR emission that allow for
the ﬁrst time a more precise assignment of the molecular
states involved in the transition. This goal is accom-

plished by comparing the observed spectrum with the
spectrum calculated by means of recently published po-
tentials of higher molecular states [15].

FIG. 1: IR emission spectrum of electron–impact excited Xe
gas at P = 0.1 MPa.The broad continuum (EXC) is the ex-
cimer spectrum. Atomic lines are numbered (see text).

In Fig. 1 we show the IR spectrum recorded in an
extended wave number range with 16 cm−1 resolution
in pure Xe gas at P = 0.1 MPa and T ≈ 300 K. The
excimer band appearing in the center is surrounded by
several atomic lines. An analysis of the nearby atomic
transitions may shed light on what atomic states the ex-
cimer is correlated with. Lines 1–6 stem from 5d − 6p
transitions. Lines 7–9 are 7s−6p transitions. Lines 10–12
are 6p − 6s transitions. Line 13 is an unresolved doublet
6p − 6s and 6d − 6p. Line 14 is a 6s − 5p transition and
lines 15–17 are 6p − 5p transitions [30].

The presence of the 7s − 6p lines very close to the
excimer band suggests that the upper bound molecular
state is related to the atomic 6p manifold. In particular,
line 9 is due to a transition from a 7s [1/2]o atomic state
to a 6p [1/2]0 one [30]. We thus assume that the bound
molecular state is correlated with the latter limit.

At the density of the present experiment, N ≈ 2.4·1025
m−3, the mean free time between collisions is estimated
to be τc ≈ 10−11 s [27], whereas the predissociation time
of the bound molecular state induced by an avoided cross-
ing with the g molecular potential related to the 5d [1/2]1
limit is estimated to be τp ≈ 10−10 s [13]. The large col-
lision rate thus leads to a quick electronic relaxation of
the excimer which would otherwise predissociate.

At present, there are no estimates for the radiative
lifetime and decay rate for vibrational relaxation for this
bound state. We assume that they do not diﬀer too much
from those of the states responsible of the VUV continua.
The radiative lifetime of highly excited vibrational states
of the 0+
u ) excimers is estimated to be τ1 ≈ 5
ns [20] and τ2 ≈ 40 ns [10], respectively. The decay rate

u and (1u, 0−

2

for vibrational relaxation k3 is the same for all states [23]
yielding a decay time τ3 = (k3N )−1 ≈ 0.65 ns. In any
case, as τc is much shorter than all characteristic times,
we assume that collisions stabilize excimers electronically
and quickly establish thermal equilibrium.

The simulation of the line shape by means of Franck–
Condon calculations requires the knowledge of the po-
tential energy curves of the initial and ﬁnal molecular
states and of the transition moment as a function of the
internuclear distance R. Theoretical calculations of the
potentials have appeared recently [15]. The choice of the
potentials has to fulﬁll the following criteria: i) the upper
bound state should be related to the 6p atomic manifold;
ii) the selection rule for state parity u ↔ g and + ↔+
must be obeyed [31]; iii) the diﬀerence between the two
potential curves at the equilibrium distance of the bound
state must be approximately equal to ˜νm. These criteria
are met by the choice of the ungerade state (3)0+
u corre-
lated with the 6p (1D2) atomic limit for the bound state
g state correlated with the 6s (3P1)
and of the gerade (1)0+
limit as the dissociative one [15]. As a transition 0+
u → 0+
g
is involved, conservation of the total angular momentum
enforces the additional selection rule ∆J = ±1 [31].

As the transition moments for these states are not
known, we assume that they do not vary too rapidly as
a function of R and calculate the line shape within the
centroid approximation [31, 32], thus yielding

and replacing the centrifugal potential by the constant

10 contribute signiﬁcantly to the spectrum owing to the
Boltzmann factor.

e ≈ 2.47 · 10−2 cm−1 yields a rotational temperature

non negligible for J ′ ≤ 250 with average hJ ′i ≈ 81.

The overlap integrals in Eq. 1 are evaluated by spline
interpolation and quadrature [35]. The theoretical line
shape is then convoluted with the instrumental function.
In Fig. 2 the simulated spectrum (dash–dotted line)
is compared with the experimental one. The shape ob-
tained using the literature potential for the (1)0+
g state
agrees only qualitatively with the experiment. It is cor-
rectly stretched towards the blue side as a consequence of
the non negligible contribution of vibrational states with
v′ > 0. However, its position is too strongly red shifted
and its width is nearly twice as large as observed. We
conclude that the potential energy curves of the bound
and dissociative states are too close to each other and
that the dissociative potential is too steep.

The repulsive part of the lower potential can be, how-
ever, determined by inverting the line shape [32]. We
assume that the upper bound state is correctly described
by the literature potential [15] and that the lower state
is described by the purely repulsive potential

(760 ± 16) cm−1, the simulated spectrum, (Fig. 2, solid
line), agrees perfectly with the experiment. The uncer-
tainties on A and V0 reﬂect the uncertainty on the ex-
perimental determination of the spectrum position and
width.

On the blue side, tiny wiggles in the simulated spec-
trum reﬂect the contributions of vibrational states with
v′ ≫ 10. They are not observed because of unfavorable
signal–to–noise ratio and Boltzmann factor.

In Fig. 3 we compare the literature potential with
that determined by the inversion procedure. The bound
state potential is also shown with some vibrational eigen-
functions in order to visualize the coordinate range in
which the Franck–Condon factors are nonnegligible. The
range, in which the comparison between the potentials
describing the dissociative state is reasonable, is limited
to (2.7 ≤ R ≤ 4.5) ˚A because vibrational states with
v′ > 10 contribute little.

The diﬀerence between the best ﬁt potential and the
theoretical one for R = Re′ is ≈ 880 cm−1. No compar-
ison can be made with the experimental determination
of the dissociative potential of this state accomplished
by REMPI techniques [19] because selective multiphoton
excitation from the molecular ground state samples the
potential for R much larger than in the present case.

We believe that the energy diﬀerence determined in
this way is large enough for theoreticians to improve the
calculation of the potentials and of the transition mo-

ments. However, we must stress the fact that in our
analysis we have chosen to consider exact the theoreti-
cal potential of the bound state in order to modify the
dissociative one.

Critical issues in our determination of the (1)0+

g state
potential are the assumption of validity of the centroid
approximation and the use of the literature potential for
the (3)0+
u state. We only justify these assumptions on the
basis of Occam’s razor. However, the assumption that
emission takes place from an excimer population in ther-
mal equilibrium explains the observed blue–asymmetry
of the line shape, and rules out the possibility that emis-
sion is produced by a transition from a vibrationally re-
laxed bound state because it would yield a line shape of
opposite asymmetry than actually observed.

The present analysis could be conﬁrmed by measuring
the spectrum as a function of T in order to change the
distribution of the rovibrational states. Moreover, this
experiment and its consequences open up the possibility
to investigate higher–lying excimer states in other rare
gases that may also be of interest in astrophysics.

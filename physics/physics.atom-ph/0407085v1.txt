We describe the operation of two GaN-based diode lasers for the laser spectroscopy of gallium
at 403 nm and 417 nm. Their use in an external cavity conﬁguration enabled the investigation of
absorption spectroscopy in a gallium hollow cathode. We have analyzed the Doppler broadened
proﬁles accounting for hyperﬁne and isotope structure and extracting both the temperature and
densities of the neutral atomic sample produced in the glow discharge. We have also built a setup
to produce a thermal atomic beam of gallium. Using the GaN-based diode lasers we have studied
the laser induced ﬂuorescence and hyperﬁne resolved spectra of gallium.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic physics has seen a tremendous development
in recent years [1]. New research ﬁelds include the cre-
ation and study of cold atoms [2], Bose-Einstein conden-
sation [3], ion traps and quantum information process-
ing [4]. A crucial role in this progress has been played
by radiation sources such as diode lasers based on GaAs
technology. In a Littrow conﬁguration an external cavity
diode laser (ECDL) represents a stable (both in intensity
and frequency), inexpensive and handy source of radia-
tion perfectly suited for atomic physics experiments [5, 6].
Recently GaN-based laser diodes [7] emitting in the
blue or near ultraviolet region have been commercially
available (Nichia Corporation, Japan). Although their
main impact is related with telecommunications and opti-
cal data storage applications, these new radiation sources
are also of great interest in atomic physics. The laser
spectroscopy of many atoms and molecules absorbing in
this wavelength region can be accessed without the use
of complicated frequency doubling systems. Another im-
portant perspective is their applications for laser cooling
and atom nano-fabrication (ANF) [8] of technological rel-
evant materials such as group III atoms [9]. In this con-
text their use would help covering the ﬂuorescence cycles
in the lambda system composed by the ground P1/2 and
P3/2 states and by the excited S1/2 state [10].

The ﬁrst spectroscopy applications of GaN laser diodes
have been recently demonstrated by studying the absorp-
tion lines of an atomic beam of indium [11], of aluminum
atoms in a hollow cathode discharge lamp [12] and of in-
dium atoms in a high temperature vapor cell [13]. Very
recently gallium spectroscopy of the D-levels was per-
formed by Rehse et al. [14] using radiation at 294 nm
from a frequency doubled Dye laser.

In this paper we describe the operation of two GaN
laser diodes at 403 nm and 417 nm for the spectroscopy
of gallium atoms in a hollow cathode discharge lamp (gal-
vatron) and an atomic beam. First we review the relevant
properties of the gallium atom from the spectroscopy
viewpoint. Then we give details of the experimental con-
ﬁgurations and results for laser spectroscopy in a galva-

tron. Hence we describe the realization of our gallium
atomic beam and show the hyperﬁne resolved spectra
obtained. The realization of an atomic beam of gallium
is the starting point of our atomic physics experiments
below the Doppler broadening and, in perspective, is the
crucial setup for laser cooling and atom nano-fabrication
(ANF) experiments [8]. For this reason we will report
some details on the vacuum system and atomic source
that we have developed.

II. THE GALLIUM ATOM

The gallium element (Z=31) has two main isotopes
69Ga (60.1%) and 71Ga (39.9%), both with nuclear spin
I=3/2. It has a melting point of 29.78 oC and a boil-
ing point of 2403 oC. Its electronic conﬁguration is
[Ar]3d104s24p1. This leads to a ground state 42P1/2.
The gross structure is shown in Fig. 1 (a) where we have
outlined the transitions in the violet and blue region at
λ1 = 403.299 nm and λ2 = 417.204 nm [15].

The lifetime of

the ﬁrst excited state is τ =
7.0(0.4) ns [16] and the rates for the two decay channels
are Γ1 = 4.9 × 107 s−1 and Γ2 = 9.2 × 107 s−1 [15, 17].
The P-states hyperﬁne (HF) splittings of both isotopes
are precisely known from atomic beam magnetic reso-
nance measurements [18, 19] and are shown in Fig. 1 (b)
and (c). The isotope shifts are ∆IS,1 = 32.8(3.5) MHz
and ∆IS,2 = 39.6(3.5) MHz. These values have been
measured together with the S-state splittings by Neijzen
and D¨onszelmann [20] using a Dye laser excitation of the
two resonance lines. In Fig. 1 (d) and (e) we have repro-
duced the structure of the gallium resonance lines. The
ratio between the HF lines is determined by the isotope
composition and by the relative hyperﬁne linestrength
SF →F ′ :

SF →F ′ = (2F + 1)(2F

+ 1)

Note that the present deﬁnition excludes all the atomic
constant associated to the deﬁnition of the absolute

linestrength [2]. Another important parameter is the sat-
uration intensity. Extending its deﬁnition [2] for an open
transition by considering the spontaneous emission rate
for each decay channel Γi (i = 1, 2), we have:

Isat,i =

πhc
3λ3 Γi.

(2)

Thus for the two transitions the saturation intensities are
Isat,1 = 15.7 mW/cm2 and Isat,2 = 26.4 mW/cm2.

III. LASER SPECTROSCOPY IN A GALLIUM
GALVATRON

Our study of atomic gallium lines was performed us-
ing two diode lasers at 403 nm and 417 nm (Nichia
NDHV310APB) with 30 mW nominal power, housed in
a DL100 system purchased from TOPTICA Photonics
(Munich, Germany). The highly stable mounting and the
diode control units for the diode temperature and cur-
rent enable to have a mode-hops free range larger than
10 GHz (i.e. over the all frequency range of the piezo
scan). The experimental setup used in our ﬁrst investi-
gation is shown in Fig. 2. The source of neutral gallium
atoms is an hollow cathode discharge lamp (galvatron)
made by Hamamatsu (series L2783-31Ar-Ga). The see-
through cathode has a cylindrical shape with a hole of
3 mm diameter and 15 mm length. The maximum cur-
rent applicable to the discharge before breaking is limited
to 6 mA. Gallium atoms are sputtered from the cathode
surface by energetic argon ions produced in the neutral
buﬀer gas (argon). The equilibrium between ion produc-
tion and recombination process leads to a gas of neutral
atomic gallium forming in the cathode region. The ar-
gon gas pressure is ﬁxed by the company to a value of
6 torr to enable a low current operation of the gallium
galvatron.

The laser absorption was monitored independently
for the two transitions sending a probe beam of about
0.3 Isat,1 and 0.2 Isat,2 through the plasma generated in
the galvatron. The signal was detected using photodi-
odes (Thorlabs DET110). A frequency calibration of the
scan was obtained using a confocal Fabry-Perot interfer-
ometer with a free spectral range of 300 MHz (Coherent
Spectrum Analyzer 33-6552).

We performed a systematic study of the absorption sig-
nals of gallium transitions as a function of the galvatron
current for both transitions. We measured the absolute
absorption of the probe by looking at its transmission sig-
nal straight from a photodiode. The maximum absorp-
tion at the line center we could detect was always below
3%. Hence the sample is optically thin. To enhance the
signal and look for saturation eﬀects we aligned a pump
beam of about 20 Isat,1 and 11 Isat,2 (from the same laser
source) with the probe in a counter-propagating beam
conﬁguration. The pump was chopped at high frequency

2

(1 KHz) and the probe signal was detected by means of
a lock-in ampliﬁer. Figures 3 (a) and (b) show Doppler
broadened absorption spectra obtained in this conﬁgura-
tion at 403 nm and 417 nm respectively.

In a standard alkali vapor cell with no collisional broad-
ening, using a counter-propagating beam conﬁguration
yields to the detection of the Doppler-free homogeneous
lineshapes. This is a standard technique based on the
saturation of the atomic transition by the pump used for
example to actively stabilize infrared ECDLs in alkalis
experiment (see for example [5]). The situation is more
complex in a galvatron because of velocity changing col-
lisions (VCC) occurring in the glow that can decrease
or prevent the saturation of a speciﬁc velocity class (in
particular the zero velocity class responsible for the ap-
pearance of the Doppler-free peaks) [21]. Velocity chang-
ing collisions distribute atoms among the diﬀerent ve-
locity classes and thus produce a broad pedestal in the
saturated absorption spectrum. When the mass ratio
between the perturber and active atom (argon and gal-
lium in our case) is not too large, a single collision com-
pletely thermalizes the atomic velocity distribution. This
is called strong collision regime [21]. The pedestal shape
in this case is a Gaussian with a width changing with the
buﬀer gas pressure. In the case of strong collisions and
high intensity pump the width equals the Doppler width
∆νD and the VCC signal becomes independent of pump
intensity. For high buﬀer gas pressure (as in our case)
the strong VCC actually destroy the Doppler-free signal.
In our spectra no sub-Doppler feature was visible and the
absorption lines were well described by a superposition
of gaussian proﬁles.
Indeed the buﬀer gas pressure of
6 torr in our galvatron causes the disappearance of the
sub-Doppler features. This cannot be avoided because a
low current operation is needed due to the low melting
point temperature of gallium.

In Fig. 3 (c) and (d) we have plotted the absorption
signals while changing the galvatron current showing the
growth of the atomic density in the glow. Absorption
proﬁles were obtained both with and without pump beam
(i.e. without lock-in ampliﬁcation). We have veriﬁed
that the two situations, hence the FWHM and lineshapes,
are completely equivalent. In Fig. 3 we showed the ones
obtained using the lock-in ampliﬁcation to enhance the
signals and have a better resolution to determine FWHM,
amplitude and centers of the lines even at lower currents.
a. Analysis: An accurate analysis has been made by
taking into account the HF components and the diﬀer-
ent isotope abundances. We ﬁt the observed curves as
a sum of several gaussians (one for each HF transition),
imposing the same width for all curves ∆νD. This is
the Doppler width resulting from the temperature of the
gas. Moreover we ﬁx the distance between the centers
and the ratio between the amplitudes following the pre-
dicted HF structure of Fig. 1 (d) and (e). Figure 4 (a)
shows the dependence on the galvatron current for the
∆νD derived from this analysis. The uncertainty on the
data points from the ﬁt is of the order of 0.2%. The width

of the lines (hence the temperature) appears to be con-
stant within the range of current explored. The width
∆νD obtained from the multiple HF ﬁt is consistently
lower than the widths obtained from single gaussian pro-
ﬁles for both 403 nm and 417 nm transitions as expected.
From the Doppler width we can deduce the temperature
of the neutral gas by the relation [22]:

M

T =

2R log 2 (cid:18)

2

c∆νD
2ν0 (cid:19)

(3)

where M is the molar weight, R the gas constant, c the
speed of light and ν0 the frequency of the transition. Con-
sidering all the ∆νD values calculated for each transition,
the temperature estimated was T = 390 K with an un-
certainty of 4%. This takes into account the ﬂuctuations
on the width obtained from diﬀerent spectra.

The absorption of light passing through an atomic sam-
ple of length L and absorption coeﬃcient α(ω, z), is ex-
pressed by the Lambert-Beer’s law [22]:

IT (ω) = I0 exp

−

(cid:20)

ZL

α(ω, z)dz

.

(cid:21)

(4)

In our case this can be simpliﬁed by assuming a uniform
density of neutral atoms in the plasma and optically thin
samples. Hence introducing the absorption cross-section
σik(ω) for the ﬁne structure transition i → k and the
lower state density of absorbing atoms ni we can express
the absorbance as:

∆I(ω)
I0

≈ niLσik(ω).

In our case to have a correct estimate of the atomic den-
sity in the glow we have also to account for the hyperﬁne
and isotope composition of the lines. Thus by using the
multiple ﬁtting procedure as made for the temperature,
we are able to give an estimate of the number of absorb-
ing atoms by evaluating the peak absorption for a single
HF line of a deﬁned isotope:

The absorption cross-section in a glow discharge is re-
lated to the temperature of the sample, the wavelength
and decay rate of the transition. This can be expressed
as [13, 23]:

where R is the gas constant, M the molar weight and g
the degeneracy of the ﬁne structure levels. For our mea-
surements the temperature in the glow was constant and
we can use the value deduced from the Doppler width to
obtain the absorption cross-section for the two transitions
σ1 = 0.457 · 10−12 m2 and σ2 = 0.475 · 10−12 m2 with
a 2% uncertainty coming from the uncertainty on the
temperature. Figure 4 (b) shows the atomic density in
the glow evaluated from each spectrum using Eq. 6 (with
L = 15 mm being the cathode length). The population
in the P3/2 state (extracted from the 417 nm spectra) is
about two times larger than the population in the P1/2
state (extracted from the 403 nm spectra). In fact our
measurements are made in a galvatron where the neutral
atomic sample is created by sputtering and recombina-
tion of gallium ions from the cathode. The population in
the two P ground levels depends upon the recombination
process that creates highly excited atoms decaying in the
ground states through spontaneous emission. Thus this
is mainly determined by the branching ratio for the S to
P transitions and much less by the Boltzmann factor or
by optical pumping.

b. Optical pumping: Another

important aspect
in the gallium lambda system is the optical pumping
within the two P ground states. We have veriﬁed the
role played by it in the galvatron absorption spectra by
looking at the absorption of the weak probe (0.3 Isat,1)
tuned on the 403 nm lines in presence of a strong
(20 Isat,1) pump beam at 403 nm (from the same laser)
or a repump beam tuned at 417 nm (speciﬁcally on the
P3/2 → F ′ = 2 transition and 11 Isat,2). When the pump
was superposed to the probe we could observe a 33% de-
crease of the absorption signal. On the other hand when
the repump was superposed we could observe an increase
of the probe absorption up to 55% of the original signal.
Finally when both pump and repump were aligned
there was an increase of the probe absorption of about
35%. All these values and line shapes did not change by
having the beams co-propagating or counter-propagating
conﬁrming the crucial role of velocity-changing collisions
in smearing out the saturation eﬀects.

In principle an alternative option for spectroscopy in-
to
vestigation is to monitor the discharge current i.e.
detect an optogalvanic signal [24]. Sub-Doppler resolu-
tion in the gallium lines was shown in [25] by the use of
optical-optical double resonance spectroscopy with op-

417.2 nm and 641.4 nm acted on the 6p 2P1/2 −5s 2S1/2 −
4p 2P3/2 level cascade. Saturation of the blue line was
achieved in a hollow cathode cooled with liquid nitro-
gen to reduce the discharge noise and pressure. We have
veriﬁed that with our setup (no liquid nitrogen cooling)
we were able to detect an optogalvanic signal. However
this reproduced the Doppler broadened proﬁles for both
transitions with no sub-Doppler features visible.

IV. LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE IN A
THERMAL GALLIUM BEAM

c. Atomic beam: The vacuum system has been care-
fully planned according to the following criteria: keep
the system as simple and standard as possible within the
current UHV technologies; have the possibility to extend
and implement the setup for ANF into a molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) system; allow the optical access needed
for the laser cooling and manipulation of gallium atoms.
The vacuum chamber can be divided in three regions: i)
production of the gallium atomic beam; ii) collimation
(through mechanical and eventually optical means) and
probing; iii) optical focusing and deposition on a sub-
strate.

The atomic source is a gallium eﬀusion cell (dual
ﬁlament type DFC-63-60-300-WK by CreaTec-Fischer,
Erligheim, DE). The PBN (Pyrolitic-Bore-Nitrate) cru-
cible has been specially designed in order to have a hor-
izontal atomic beam and to avoid damaging the oven by
gallium reacting with the heating elements. The crucible
is made of four parts: an outer standard cylindrical cru-
cible, an inner boat shaped part where gallium is evap-
orated, a spacer and a 1 mm insert placed at the lip of
the outer crucible (that is always kept at a temperature
120 oC higher than the inner part to avoid gallium con-
densation).

To keep a good ultra-high vacuum we use two ion
pumps (40 l/s in the oven region and 55 l/s in the cooling
and deposition region) that are switched on after a rough-
ing and bake-out of the system is obtained. This gives a
pressure of about 5 · 10−10 mbar in the deposition region
(if required a better UHV could be achieved by the use of
a non evaporable getter pump). The eﬀusion cell is gen-
erally operated at a temperature of 1100 oC (the gallium
vapor pressure at this temperature is ∼ 6 · 10−2 mbar).
The atomic beam coming out from the cell is collimated
by a 1 mm skimmer placed 5 cm after the eﬀusive source.
According to Knudsen law this source provides a ﬂux of
atoms after the skimmer of about 5 · 1014 atoms/s with
a most probable velocity of vp = 690 m/s along the lon-
gitudinal direction.

d. Atomic ﬂuorescence: By sending a laser beam
tuned on the gallium resonances at 403 nm or 417 nm
orthogonal to the atomic beam direction, we detected
the laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) at right angles to
both the atomic beam and the direction of laser light
using either a CCD camera or a photodiode with a col-
lection optics. The top parts of Fig. 5 show two images
of our gallium atomic beam obtained using the 403 nm
ECDL tuned on resonance with the P1/2, F = 2 →
S1/2, F ′ = 1 hyperﬁne transition for the two diﬀerent iso-
topes. From the analysis of these gaussian proﬁles and
the geometry of the beams we extracted information on
the width of the atomic beam and obtained a divergence
of 15 ± 2 mrad. This result is consistent with an esti-
mate of about 20 mrad obtained from the geometry of
the collimating holes.

4

The LIF signal generated by the laser beam has been
also collected on a photodiode and analyzed using a phase
sensitive detection (PSD) for the two transitions indepen-
dently. A reference modulation frequency (1 KHz) is sent
to the ECDL current while the LIF signal is recorded
through lock-in ampliﬁcation. A scan was sent to the
ECDL piezo in order to observe the hyperﬁne resolved
spectra of gallium at 403 nm and 417 nm. Typical sig-
nals are shown in Fig. 6. The (a) and (b) plots have
been obtained with laser intensity of about 20 Isat,1 and
11 Isat,2 respectively. The 100 MHz large broadening
of the derivative signals is not only due to laser power
broadening but also to the applied dither on the laser
current needed to enhance the signal to noise ratio. In
fact lowering the applied dither and the laser power we
have split the closest doublets as shown in Fig. 6 (c) and
(d). These spectra were obtained with an intensity of
1.5 Isat,1 and 1 Isat,2 respectively. The width reduces to
50 MHz, that agrees well with what is expected from the
beam divergence. We veriﬁed that at large amplitude of
the dither the spectra were ﬁtted by a gaussian proﬁle,
while lowering the dither the dispersive signals become
closer to multiple lorentzian derivative signals.
In fact
we expect the PSD spectra to be derivatives of Voigt
proﬁles. A study of line shapes in frequency-modulation
spectroscopy is beyond the scope of this paper. For a
comprehensive investigation in atomic media see for ex-
ample the work by Xia et al. [26].

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

External cavity diode lasers at 403nm and 417nm have
been tested and tuned on resonance with gallium tran-
sitions. Laser absorption spectroscopy in a galvatron
has proved to be a useful tool for a quick tuning of the
ECDLs. We have used these laser sources to study ab-
sorption spectroscopy in a gallium hollow cathode ex-
ploring the atom density production and Doppler width
(hence temperature) as a function of discharge current.
Although sub-Doppler features were not visible in a sim-
ple saturated absorption conﬁguration, the gallium gal-
vatron has proved to be a very useful tool to perform ab-
sorption spectroscopy of atomic gallium with the ECDLs
in the blue. We have also built the vacuum system and
produced a collimated thermal atomic beam of gallium
in a UHV environment. Using the ECDLs we have per-
formed LIF detection with a phase sensitive technique
enhancing the hyperﬁne resolved spectra of gallium.

Our interest in GaN-based diode lasers lies mainly in
their use for laser cooling and atom nano-fabrication.
There is no closed transition from the true ground
state suitable for laser cooling and two alternatives are
possible: a two-colour laser cooling using diode lasers
at 403 nm and 417 nm on the P states [10] or laser
cooling at 294 nm (by frequency doubling a Dye laser),
where a closed transition exists between the P3/2 and
D5/2 states (this scheme is in use at Colorado State

5

University by the group of S.A.Lee [27]). Our aim is
to use the blue and violet diode chips to investigate
two-colour laser cooling on the P-S transitions. The
peculiarities of the gallium lower energy levels open up
many interesting problems regarding the best cooling
scheme to be used for the atomic beam collimation.
From our ﬁrst divergence measurements we can estimate
the initial width of the transverse velocity distribution
to be close to the velocity capture range vc = λiΓi/2π
(i=1,2) [2], 9.2 m/s for gallium. If we consider a Doppler
cooling on one of the transition at 403 nm or 417 nm,
we need to scatter few thousand photons to reach ve-
locities of the order of the Doppler limit vD = 25 cm/s,
corresponding to a divergence of about 0.4 mrad well
suited for ANF. An interesting perspective is the use
of two-colour Doppler cooling in a similar fashion as in
the work by Rooijakkers et al. [28] on helium atoms. In
the case of helium we have a cascade three-level system.

Optimum cooling parameters were found, showing that
the cooling force is an order of magnitude stronger than

to perform a study of the two-colour force for gallium
and compare it with the standard two level situation.

FIG. 2: Experimental setup for absorption spectroscopy in a
gallium galvatron. The light from the laser diode (ECDL) is
split using quarter waveplates and beam splitter cubes (BSC),
then aligned in a crossed-beam conﬁguration and then de-
tected using photodiodes (PD). The probe signal is enhanced
by lock-in ampliﬁcation. The frequency calibration is ob-
tained using a confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer with a free
spectral range of 300 MHz.

FIG. 3: Doppler broadened absorption spectra at 403 nm and
417 nm obtained in crossed-beam conﬁguration for a current
of 4.7 mA in the galvatron (see text). The strong velocity
changing collisions (VCC) in the cathode region prevent the
formation of sub-Doppler features. In (a) and (b) the absorp-
tion signal (black lines) is well described by a superposition
(gray solid line) of gaussian proﬁles (gray dashed lines). In
(c) and (d) we have studied the gallium atomic production
in function of the galvatron current for both transitions. A
range of galvatron currents between 1.6 mA and 4.7 mA was
explored in steps of ∼0.4 mA.

FIG. 4: (a) Study of the optical lines FWHM versus the gal-
vatron current. From the Doppler broadened spectra we can
extract the FWHM performing a multiple ﬁt that considers
HF and isotope components. (b) Particle density extracted
from the Lambert-Beer’s law for an optically thin medium.
By accounting for HF and isotope composition of the lines
the atomic density in each P state and isotope was estimated
versus the galvatron current.

FIG. 5: On the top part, CCD images of the gallium atomic
beam. On the bottom part vertical proﬁles. The atomic beam
direction is perpendicular to the page of the images (as shown
in the top left image), the laser beam is sent horizontally and
orthogonal to the atomic beam. The laser induced ﬂuores-
cence (LIF) signal at 403 nm has been detected orthogonally
to both directions. The laser was tuned on resonance with
the P1/2, F = 2 → S1/2, F ′
= 1 hyperﬁne transition of the
two isotopes.

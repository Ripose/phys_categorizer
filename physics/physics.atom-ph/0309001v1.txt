Abstract

Motivated by recent discussions concerning the manner in which damping appears in the

electric polarizability, we show that (a) there is a dependence of the nonresonant contri-

bution on the damping and that (b) the damping enters according to the “opposite sign

prescription.” We also discuss the related question of how the damping rates in the polar-

izability are related to energy-level decay rates.

INTRODUCTION

Several recent papers address the question of how material damping eﬀects should

be included in the response of an atom or molecule to an applied electric ﬁeld [1]-[5].

We will consider the simplest case, that of the linear atomic polarizability, which in

the absence of damping is given by the Kramers-Heisenberg formula,

αi(ω) =

e2
3~

Xj

|rji|2

ωji − ω

(cid:18)

+

ωji + ω (cid:19)

for state i. Here ωji and rji are the transition (angular) frequency and coordinate

matrix element, respectively, between states i and j, and the ﬁeld frequency ω is

assumed to be far removed from any of the atomic transition frequencies ωji. More

generally one associates damping rates γji with the diﬀerent transitions and writes

αi(ω) =

e2
3~

Xj

where ξ = +1 according to the so-called “opposite sign” prescription and ξ = −1

in the “constant sign” prescription. The diﬀerence appears only in the nonresonant

terms, and is therefore unimportant in most situations. However, the question of

which prescription is the correct one raises some interesting points, as we shall see,

and the purpose of this paper is to address some of these points as well as to answer

the question of whether one should take ξ = +1 or ξ = −1 in equation (2).

One might ask ﬁrst whether a damping term should appear at all in the nonres-

onant part of the Kramers-Heisenberg formula, i.e., whether we should in fact take

ξ = 0 instead of either ξ = +1 or ξ = −1. An analysis involving the diagonalization

of the (two-level) atom-ﬁeld Hamiltonian in the rotating-wave approximation, for in-

stance, shows that there is no damping term in the nonresonant denominator [6], a

result that is certainly accurate for most practical purposes. In a broader context the

issue here is an old one. Thus the imaginary part of the polarizability (2) implies an

absorption coeﬃcient having the usual Lorentzian form

(1)

as well as a nonresonant part

(4)

for a transition of frequency ω0 and linewidth γ, and one might question whether, as a

matter of principle, (4) contributes to the absorption lineshape. In his consideration

of possible corrections to the Weisskopf-Wigner lineshape, Lamb [7] noted that “such

a contribution [as (4)] appears in some derivations,” but added that it would be

negligible compared with the resonant contribution (3).

The eﬀect of damping on the nonresonant part of the polarizability is not an

entirely trivial matter, and the literature relating to the subject reveals signiﬁcant

disagreement on some rather basic aspects of dissipation theory. The purpose of this

paper is to address the principal points where there is disagreement and to obtain

what we regard as the correct form of the polarizability when damping is included.

In the following section we consider the problem of the electric-dipole interaction of

a two-level atom with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, assuming that all but one

of the ﬁeld modes are initially unoccupied. Using the rotating-wave approximation

(RWA) for the atomic source ﬁeld but not for the applied ﬁeld, we obtain exactly

the result cited earlier [6], and in particular we ﬁnd that there is no contribution

from (radiative) damping to the nonresonant term in the polarizability. In Section

III we go beyond the RWA in the atomic source ﬁeld and ﬁnd that the damping now

appears in the nonresonant term, and that it does so in accordance with the “opposite

sign” prescription. Section IV presents a discussion of these results, including their

connection to the classical theory of radiative damping. Section V focuses on the

form of the damping rate γji, and we argue that, contrary to what sometimes appears

in the literature, γji depends on the sum rather than the diﬀerence of the level decay

rates. Our conclusions are summarized in Section VI.

for a two-level atom (TLA) with transition frequency ω0 and dipole moment d inter-

acting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The σ operators are the usual Pauli operators,
with σ and σ† the lowering and raising operators for the TLA. ak and a†
k are the anni-
hilation and creation operators for ﬁeld mode k, and Ck = (d · ek,λ/~)(2π~ωk/V )1/2,
with V the quantization volume. The subscript k denotes (k, λ), where k is the

wave vector assocated with a plane-wave mode of frequency ωk = |k|c and ek,λ is a
corresponding polarization unit vector (k · ek,λ = 0, ek,λ · e∗

k,λ′ = δλλ′, λ = 1, 2).

The commutation relations for the atom and ﬁeld operators give the Heisenberg

equations of motion

Ck(σzak − a†

Xk

˙ak = −iωkak + Ck(σ + σ†)

(5)

(6)

(7)

We have chosen a normal ordering for the ﬁeld annihilation and creation operators,

which is especially useful in the case that the applied ﬁeld is described by a coherent

state [Eq. (11)]. As we are interested only in determining the linear response, the

equation of motion for σz will not be needed for our purposes.

The formal solution of equation (7) is

ak(t) = ak(0)e−iωkt + Ck

dt′[σ(t′) + σ†(t′)]eiωk(t′−t)

(8)

In one version of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) we ignore the coupling

between the creation operator for the ﬁeld and the raising operator for the atom;

this corresponds, for the purpose of obtaining the equation of motion for the ﬁeld
operators, to the neglect of the terms a†
kσ† and σak in the Hamiltonian (5). In this

in the integral appearing in (10). Since we want to obtain the polarizability for

the TLA in a particular state, we assume further that the atom remains with high

probability in its initial state. Assuming this initial state to be the lower state, we

approximate hσz(t)i by −1, so that, using (13) and the approximation (14), we replace

frequency-dependent [8]. (∆±(ω) is obviously divergent but, as discussed in Section

4, this has no direct bearing on our conclusions regarding the eﬀect of damping on

the polarizability.) To obtain the polarizability α(ω) we write

Note that γ+(ω) = 0, and that therefore there is no damping contribution to the

second (nonresonant) term. γ−(ω0) is half the radiative decay rate of the upper state

in the absence of any applied ﬁeld.

III. DERIVATION OF LINEAR POLARIZABILITY WITHOUT RWA

Let us now recalculate the polarizability, this time retaining both terms inside the

integral of equation (8), i.e., without making the RWA in the (source) ﬁeld produced

by the atom under consideration. Then (9) is replaced by

dt′[hσ†(t′)σz(t)i + hσ(t′)σz(t)i]e−iωk(t′−t)

(22)

when we take expectation values as before. The approximations tantamount to (14)

are

hσz(t)σ(t′)i ∼= hσz(t′)σ(t′)i = −hσ(t′)i
hσz(t)σ†(t′)i ∼= hσz(t′)σ†(t′)i = hσ†(t′)i
hσ†(t′)σz(t)i ∼= hσ†(t′)σz(t′)i = −hσ†(t′)i
hσ(t′)σz(t)i ∼= hσ(t′)σz(t′)i = hσ(t′)i

where we use the equal-time identities σz(t)σ(t) = −σ(t)σz(t) = −σ(t). Using these
approximations in (22), together with the approximation hσz(t)i ∼= −1 in the second

term, we obtain the non-RWA extension of (15):

h ˙σ(t)i = −iω0hσ(t)i +

It is important to note that in equations (23) we have used the commutation relations

between σz(t) and σ(t), σ†(t), and have obviously not made the approximation that

σz could be replaced by −1. The latter approximation is made only in the second

term of (22), where σz multiplies the applied ﬁeld but no atom operator, so that the

approximation does not violate the commutation relations from which we obtained

the equations of motion. The two approximations are diﬀerent: that made in (23)

assumes that σz(t) varies little on time scales ∼ 1/ωk for ﬁeld frequencies ωk ∼ ω that

will contribute signiﬁcantly to the variation of hσ(t)i, whereas that made in replacing

hσz(t)E0 cos ωt by −E0 cos ωt assumes that the atom remains with high probability in

its lower state because the ﬁeld frequency lies outside the absorption linewidth. The

diﬀerence between these two approximations involving σz turns out to be irrelevant

for the ﬁnal results when the RWA is made, as is clear from (14).

We again have a solution of the form (16), now with s and r satisfying

In contrast to the RWA result (21), ∆±(ω) and γ±(ω) appear in both the resonant

and nonresonant terms of (28). Consider ﬁrst the physical signiﬁcance of ∆±(ω),

assuming that the frequency ω of the initially occupied ﬁeld mode is suﬃciently close

to ω0 that we may take

∆−(ω) ≈ ∆−(ω0) =

and focusing only on the resonant term in α(ω). In a more complete analysis involving

the transformation from the fundamental minimal coupling form of the Hamiltonian

to the electric dipole form, it is found that the additional term 2π

d3P⊥ · P⊥ ap-

pearing in the transformed Hamiltonian has the eﬀect of replacing (29) by [9]

R

∆−(ω0) ≈

With this modiﬁcation it is seen that ∆(ω0) ≡ ∆−(ω0) − ∆+(ω0) is simply the (un-

renormalized) TLA radiative frequency shift, i.e., the diﬀerence in the radiative level

shifts of the two levels [10]. In general, however, the approximation (29) is not appli-
cable, and the radiative level shifts ~∆±(ω) depend on the frequency of the initially

occupied mode. In the polarizability (28) the frequency shift ∆(ω) ≡ ∆−(ω) − ∆+(ω)

adds to the ﬁeld frequency ω in both the resonant and nonresonant terms, whereas

in the RWA ∆+(ω) does not appear in the resonant term and ∆−(ω) does not appear

in the nonresonant term. In other words, the RWA does not correctly include the

radiative frequency shift as the diﬀerence in the radiative level shifts of the TLA.

The expressions for the level shifts ~∆±(ω) are speciﬁc to the TLA model, but

are easily generalized to the case of a real atom. This extension, even with the

9

standard renormalization procedures, still leaves us with divergent level shifts in the
nonrelativistic approximation. A high-frequency cutoﬀ mc2/~ results in Bethe’s ap-

proximation to the Lamb shift [10]. Since this procedure is very well known, and

we are in any case only concerned with the form in which the radiative corrections

appear in the polarizability, and not their numerical values, we will simply assume

henceforth that the frequency shift has been accounted for in writing ω0 ± ω.

Thus

α(ω) =

d2
3~ (cid:18)

1
ω0 − ω − iγ(ω)

+

1
ω0 + ω + iγ(ω) (cid:19)

(31)

where γ(ω) = γ−(ω) + γ+(ω). Like ∆(ω), iγ(ω) is eﬀectively an addition to the

applied ﬁeld frequency ω. Unlike the frequency shift, however, the damping rate γ(ω)

is half the sum of the decay rates γ±(ω) of the two levels. Of course the decay rate

γ+(ω) of the ground state in our two-level model is zero but, as discussed in the next

section, (31) is valid more generally when the decay rate of the lower level of the

transition is not zero. That is, the damping rate appearing in the contribution to the

polarizability from any given transition involves half the sum of the decay rates of

the two levels of the transition.

Regardless of whether the lower-level decay rate vanishes, the non-RWA result (31)

shows that both the resonant and nonresonant contributions to the polarizability have

a nonvanishing damping term in their denominators, this damping term being half the

upper-level decay rate. In particular, it is seen that the damping appears according

to the “opposite sign prescription,” i.e., ξ = +1 is the correct choice in the dispersion

formula (2). The same conclusion was reached by diﬀerent lines of reasoning by

Buckingham and Fischer [2].

Note that, if γ is taken to be a (positive) constant, independent of frequency, then

the opposite sign prescription is consistent with the causality requirement that the

polarizability should be analytic in the upper half of the complex ω plane [11]. But in

general the decay rates are in fact frequency-dependent [8], and causality is ensured

only if the model used to calculate γ(ω) is itself causal. In fact, as recalled below,

radiative damping provides an example in which this is not the case.

10

In one approach to a classical calculation of the natural lineshape, one considers the

solution x(t) = A0e−γt sin(ω0t) of a damped dipole oscillator with resonance frequency

ω0. The lineshape is taken to be proportional to the squared modulus of the Fourier

transform

ω0 − ω − iγ

(32)

and is seen to be consistent with the “opposite sign” prescription. In contrast to this,

an old paper by Weisskopf [12] implies the result

a(ω) ∝

1
ω0 − ω − iγ

(cid:18)

−

1
ω0 + ω − iγ (cid:19)

which is consistent with the “constant sign” prescription. However, since this result

is based on the integral appearing in (32), it seems that (33) involves a sign error or

perhaps just a typographical error.

Since the absorption coeﬃcient may for our purposes be taken to be proportional

to the imaginary part of α(ω), equation (31) implies an absorption lineshape propor-

tional to

L(ω) =

γ
(ω0 − ω)2 + γ2 −

γ
(ω0 + ω)2 + γ2

The same result, for γ taken to be a constant, was obtained on the basis of the

Lorentz model by Van Vleck and Weisskopf [13], who noted that the minus sign in

the nonresonant term “must be used because the excitation of the molecule is here

accompanied by emission rather than absorption of a light quantum,” a process which

is excluded when the RWA is made [14].

It is also of interest to compare the result (31) with the corresponding result given

by the classical theory of radiative damping based on the equation

p

involving eﬀective oscillator strengths f1 and f2 are the usual substitutions required to

put classical oscillator results in agreement with some of the corresponding quantum-

mechanical expressions.

The ω3 in the denominator of (36), or in other words the third derivative of x in

equation (35), leads to a pole in the upper half of the complex ω plane, thus violating

the causality requirement that the polarizability be analytic in the upper half-plane.

The nonrelativistic theory of radiative reaction is well known to be acausal, but the

acausality occurs on such a short time scale that relativistic quantum eﬀects must

be taken into account. For most practical purposes the acausality is of no conse-

quence. Thus, for instance, equation (36) leads to the correct extinction coeﬃcient

(∝ ωIm[α(ω)]) due to Rayleigh scattering.

V. RELATION OF DAMPING IN THE POLARIZABILITY TO LEVEL DE-

CAY RATES

These considerations are easily extended beyond the two-level model, with the

result that the linear atomic polarizability has the form

αi(ω) =

|rji|2

ωji − ω − iγji(ω)

(cid:18)

+

1
ωji + ω + iγji(ω) (cid:19)

(37)

The damping rate γji(ω) has a “dephasing” contribution associated, for instance,

with elastic collisions, as well as a contribution associated with the decay rate of the

atomic states i and j. Here we consider only the latter contribution, which is due to

radiative decay and other loss processes. In the case of radiative decay, for instance,

γji is found, by a straightforward multilevel generalization of the calculations in the

preceding sections, to be half the sum of the radiative decay rates associated with the

12

two states i and j:

γji(ω) =

2e2ω3
3~c3 


|rjm|2 +

|rim|2

XEj>Em

XEi>Em


where Em denotes the energy of state m. If we replace ω3 by ω3
0 in this formula, we

obtain half the spontaneous decay rate of state j in the case that the ﬁeld is initially

(38)

in the vacuum state. This result was obtained, for example, by Weisskopf and Wigner

[15], Landau [16], and many others [9]. The same conclusion is reached in the more

general case where the energy levels decay by nonradiative channels: γji(ω) is half

the sum of the total decay rates of the states i and j.

Various authors, however, have calculated or assumed—erroneously, in our

opinion—that γji involves the diﬀerence in the decay rates of the states i and j [17],

[18], [19]. In addition to the Heisenberg-picture calculation leading to the conclusion

that γji involves the sum rather than the diﬀerence of energy-level decay rates, as

presented in this paper, the following simple argument can be used. Let ci(t) and cj(t)

be the (Schr¨odinger-picture) probability amplitudes for states i and j, and let γi and
γj be the decay rates of these states. Then c∗
the polarizability, decay at exp[− 1

j (t), which determine
2 (γi+γj)t], and so the linewidth in the polarizability
must involve the sum of γi and γj rather than the diﬀerence. Sushchinskii [17], for
instance, expresses his results in terms of complex energies E′

i (t)cj(t) and ci(t)c∗

2iΓi and their
2i(Γi − Γj), whereas the appropriate diﬀerences

i = Ei − 1

diﬀerences E′

i − E′

j = Ei − Ej − 1

entering into the polarizability are E′∗

i − E′

j and E′

i − E′∗
j .

Finally we note that Andrews et al. [19] have stated a polarizability sum rule which

in the simplest case of the linear polarizability can be expressed as

i αi(ω) = 0. A
physical plausibility argument for this sum rule can be adduced as follows. If pi is the

P

probability that the atom is in state i, then the linear polarizability at ﬁeld frequency

ω is

Xi
Consider the idealized limit in which all the pi are equal. Then the polarizability and

α(ω) =

piαi(ω)

(39)

therefore the induced emission or absorption rate at frequency ω becomes proportional

13

to just

i αi(ω). But if all the states are equally populated the net induced emission
and absorption rate must vanish, implying the polarizability sum rule conjectured by

P

Andrews et al. From the expression (37) it follows that this sum rule is statisﬁed

only if γji is symmetric in i and j, i.e., γji must involve the sum rather than the

diﬀerence of γi and γj. (We note that, in the case of the constant sign prescription for

the damping terms in the polarizability, the polarizability sum rule would be satisﬁed

only if γji were antisymmetric in i and j.)

VI. SUMMARY

Following a standard, nonrelativisitic approach, we have considered speciﬁcally

the case of a two-level atom interacting with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, one

mode of which is initially occupied and described by a coherent state. Working in

the Heisenberg picture, we calculated the polarizability with and without making

the RWA for the atomic source ﬁeld.

In the RWA we obtained a known result,

and in particular the nonresonant contribution to the polarizability was found to

have no damping factor in its denominator. Going beyond the RWA, however, we

found that both the resonant and nonresonant contributions to the polarizability have

the radiative damping rate in their denominators, and that the polarizability has a

form that is consistent with the so-called opposite sign prescription for including the

damping.

The radiative frequency shift appearing in the non-RWA expression for the

polarizability depends on the radiative level shifts in the correct way, i.e., it is the

diﬀerence of the two level shifts. The damping rate appearing in the non-RWA

expression for the polarizability is half the sum of the radiative decay rates of the

two levels, in contrast to the diﬀerence of the decay rates that has been obtained or

assumed in some treatments. The fact that the polarizability depends symmetrically

on the decay rates of the energy levels is consistent with the polarizability sum rule

of Andrews et al. [19] when the (correct) opposite sign prescription is used.

[14] Van Vleck and Weisskopf went on to show that, when the dipole orientations or phases

after each collision are treated statistically according to the Boltzmann distribution,

rather than assumed to be random as in the original Lorentz treatment, one obtains

an absorption lineshape in which the nonresonant contribution is added rather than

subtracted from the resonant term. Then, instead of the vanishing absorption predicted

by the original Lorentz treatment when the absorption frequency ω0 → 0, one obtains

the Debye lineshape.

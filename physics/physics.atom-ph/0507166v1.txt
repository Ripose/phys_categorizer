Abstract

In the conventional quantum mechanics (i.e., hermitian QM) the adia-
batic theorem for systems subjected to time periodic ﬁelds holds only for
bound systems and not for open ones (where ionization and dissociation
take place) [D. W. Hone, R. Ketzmerik, and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. A
56, 4045 (1997)]. Here with the help of the (t,t’) formalism combined
with the complex scaling method we derive an adiabatic theorem for open
systems and provide an analytical criteria for the validity of the adiabatic
limit. The use of the complex scaling transformation plays a key role in
our derivation. As a numerical example we apply the adiabatic theorem
we derived to a 1D model Hamiltonian of Xe atom which interacts with
strong, monochromatic sine-square laser pulses. We show that the gener-
ation of odd-order harmonics and the absence of hyper-Raman lines, even
when the pulses are extremely short, can be explained with the help of
the adiabatic theorem we derived.

1 Motivation

When matter is exposed to intense laser ﬁelds, high harmonics (HHs) of the
incident radiation may be produced. Usually, only odd harmonics are obtained
even when the laser pulses are short (for theoretical and experimental work
which demonstrates this see [1] and [2], respectively). Since the duration of the
pulse in time is inversely proportional to its width in energy space, one may ﬁnd
this result surprising, as one may expect to obtain also a large distribution of
frequencies in the scattered ﬁeld. Why are only odd harmonics obtained even
when the laser pulses are short?

For CW lasers (and symmetric ﬁeld-free potential) using the non-hermitian
Floquet theory it was proved that only odd harmonics are obtained when the

1

dynamics is controlled by a single resonance Floquet quasienergy (QE) state
[3],[4]. When laser pulses are used it was argued that this proof holds since usu-
ally the populated resonance states are associated with very diﬀerent lifetimes
and the dynamics is controlled by the resonance state which has the longest
lifetime. However, this argument may hold only when the duration of the laser
pulses is large enough to enable the decay of the short lived resonances. Indeed
numerical simulations showed that the harmonic generation spectra (HGS) as
obtained from a single non-hermitian (complex scaled) resonance Floquet state
is in a remarkable agreement with the results obtained from conventional (i.e.,
hermitian) time dependent simulation [5].

The question that is addressed in this work is weather an analytical criteria
for the shape and duration of the laser pulse for which the system is controlled
by a single resonance Floquet state can be given. It is obvious that the question
regarding the possibility of population of a single resonance state is connected
with the question regarding the degree of adiabaticity of the process. The
question is therefore under which conditions can a short laser pulse be deﬁned
as adiabatic one. The answer to this question is important not only to harmonic
generation (HG) studies but also for other, more general studies where lasers
are used to control the dynamics, for example adiabatic STIRAP procedures
[6].

In order to answer this question we use the (t,t’) formalism [7] together
with the non-hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM) formalism. The use of
NHQM formalism to describe the dynamics of atoms/molecules subjected to
CW laser ﬁelds is essential, since only then can the dynamics be described in
terms physical, square integrable, resonance Floquet states. Otherwise, the
description of the dynamics in terms of hermitian Floquet states results in very
little physical insight on the problem, as well as numerical problems, not to
mention that it is limited to the description of bound systems only.
In the
hermitian case the spectrum is continuous and becomes discrete only due to
the use of ﬁnite box quantization; moreover, a single Floquet state in hermitian
QM can not describe neither the resonance phenomena nor the ﬁeld ionization
phenomena [8].

Our strategy is as follows. In section 2 we give a brief review of the for-
malism used in our derivation [namely the (t,t’) formalism for hermitian and
non-hermitian Hamiltonians]. In section 3 we introduce the new derivation of
the adiabatic theorem for open quantum systems in strong laser pulses. In sec-
tion 4 we apply the adiabatic theorem as derived in section 3 to a test-case model
hamiltonian which describes a 1D Xe atom subjected to a sin-square pulse of
monochromatic laser. In section 4 we conclude.

2 A brief review of the (t,t’) formalism

The (t,t’) formalism enables one to obtain analytical solutions for any time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) with time-dependent Hamiltonians.
The formalism rests on lifting of the TDSE to an extended Hilbert space, prop-

2

agation of the wavefunction there and ﬁnally projecting back to the physical
Hilbert space.

The solution of a general TDSE is given as usual by:

H(r, t)Ψ(r, t) = i¯h

Ψ(r, t)

(1)

∂
∂t

with the initial condition Ψ(r, t = 0) and the vector operator r describes the
internal degrees of freedom. It has been shown by Peskin and Moiseyev that by
regarding time as an extra coordinate t′, one can obtain another Schr¨odinger
equation with a time independent Hamiltonian in the extended Hilbert space
(r, t′), whose solution Ψ(r, t′, t) has an analytical time dependence (given by the
analytical time evolution operator associated with time-independent Hamiltoni-
ans) [7]. Our desired wavfunction Ψ(r, t) can be deduced from this wavfunction
by a simple operation (that will be shown later). The advantage is that eﬃ-
cient propagation schemes designed for solving the TDSE with time-independent
Hamiltonians could then be used also for time dependent Hamiltonians, thus
releasing one from the diﬃculties associated with time ordering.

Let us deﬁne the following Floquet-type operator

HF (r, t′) ≡ (H(r, t) − i¯h

)|t′=t = H(r, t′) − i¯h

, 0 ≤ t′ ≤ tf

(2)

∂
∂t

∂
∂t′

where t′ should be regarded as a coordinate and tf is the ﬁnal time of propaga-
tion. When the Hamiltonian H(r, t) is time periodic with period T , the operator
is the Floquet operator and tf ≡ T . Provided that correct boundary conditions
are chosen for the t′ coordinate, this operator is hermitian since it is the sum of
two hermitian operators. This operator has eigenstates and eigenvalues which
are given by the eigenvalue equation:

HF (r, t′)φα(r, t′) = εαφα(r, t′)

(3)

and the set of eigenstates is complete in the extended Hilbert space (r, t′) with
respect to the inner product

hhφα|φα′ iir,t′ ≡

d3rφ∗α(r, t′)φα′ (r, t′) = δα,α′

(4)

Tp

Say the following TDSE with time-independent Hamiltonian need to be

solved with the initial state Ψ(r, t′, t = 0):

HF (r, t′)Ψ(r, t′, t) = i¯h

Ψ(r, t′, t)

Using the deﬁnition of HF (r, t′) this equation reads

H(r, t′)Ψ(r, t′, t) = i¯h(

+

)Ψ(r, t′, t)

By setting the cut t = t′ on Eq.6 one gets:

[H(r, t′)Ψ(r, t′, t)]|t′=t = H(r, t)[Ψ(r, t′, t)|t′=t] = i¯h

[Ψ(r, t′, t)|t′=t]

(7)

∂
∂t

where the following property

∂
∂t

∂
∂t
(which holds true for any function of t′ and t. The relation between the solution
of Eq.7 and the solution of the original TDSE (Eq.1) is given by

[Ψ(r, t′, t)|t′=t] = [(

)Ψ(r, t′, t)]|t′=t

∂
∂t′

(8)

+

Ψ(r, t) = Ψ(r, t′, t)|t′=t

(9)

(10)

provided that these two diﬀerential equations have the same initial condition.
Hence,

Ψ(r, t′, t)|t′=t=0 = Ψ(r, t = 0)

It is seen from Eq.10 that apparently the initial condition isn’t unique. While
this holds true in case that one is interested only in the physical wavefunction
Ψ(r, t), it should be noted that if one wishes to calculate physical quantities in
the extended Hilbert space using the function Ψ(r, t′, t) and then go back to the
original Hilbert space, and get the correct results, the initial condition in the
extended Hilbert space should behaves as a delta-function in t′. The correct
initial condition will therefore be Ψ(r, t′, t = 0) = Ψ(r, t = 0)δ(t′).

The main advantage of the (t,t’) formalism from a numerical point of view
is that it enables the use of an analytical expression for the time evolution
operator, without the necessity of time ordering, even when the Hamiltonian is
strongly time-dependent. Any TDSE with time-dependent Hamiltonian could
be replaced by a diﬀerent TDSE, with time-independent Hamiltonian, for which
a greater number of accurate integration schemes exist and the solution is given
)tΨ(r, t′, t = 0)). The price one pays however
formally by Ψ(r, t′, t) = e−
is that the new TDSE need to be integrated over one more dimension.

The main advantage of the (t,t’) formalism from a conceptional point of
view is that it enables to describe any time-dependent dynamics in terms of
stationary eigenstates and eigenvalues.

So far the derivation has been carried out within the framework of the con-
ventional (i.e., hermitian) quantum mechanics. Using the complex-scaling (CS)
transformation [9, 10]

HF (r, t′) −→ H θ

F (r, t′) ≡ H(reiθ, t) − i¯h

(11)

∂t

the quasienergy spectrum of the Floquet Hamiltonian becomes complex and
square-integrable resonance states, that were embedded in the continuum in
the unscaled problem, are uncovered. For sake of simplicity we drop the index θ
in all θ-dependent expressions (operators, eigenvalues, eigenvectors etc.) in the
proceeding text.

3 The adiabatic theorem for time-dependent sys-

tems

The adiabatic theorem for time-dependent bound systems was derived in 1997
by Kohn et al. [15] and in 1999 by Holthaus et al. [16] who used the (t,t’) for-
malism to describe the evolution of a system subjected to chirped laser pulses.
As discussed by Kohn and co-workers, the adiabatic approach is not applica-
ble for open systems since the quasienergy level spacing reduce to zero as the
number of basis functions used in the numerical calculation is increased. To
avoid this diﬃculty Baer et al.
[17] applied the adiabatic theorem to time-
dependent open systems in the high frequency regime where the system was
stabilized and the resonances (which were embedded in the continuum part of
the Floquet spectra) became so narrow that they could be practically treated
as bound states. The purpose of our work is to derive the adiabatic theorem for
general time-dependent open systems where there are no bound states and the
resonances aren’t necessarily narrow. We are using the non-hermitian Floquet
formalism (through the CS formalism) which allow us to describe the dynamics
in term of non-hermitian resonance states (see for example [9]-[21], and also the
work of Day et al. [22] who used the NH Floquet multistate method to study the
applicability of the single Floquet resonance approximation in the description
of the dynamics of H atom subjected to intense laser ﬁelds of various strengths).
Below we derive the adiabatic theorem for time-dependent open systems
using the extended (t,t’) formalism. By the term ”extended” (t,t’) formalism
we mean that in the same manner presented, one may add any number of time
”coordinates” to the Schr¨odinger equation as one wishes, if by this a better
understanding or easier solution of the problem is achieved. Here we found that
by addition of 2 time ”coordiantes” to the TDSE, we simpliﬁed the derivation
of the adiabaticity criteria for photo-induced dynamical systems. In this sense,
we are using a (t,t’,t”) formalism.

We would like to study the dynamics of a single active electron in an atom or
molecule, subjected to a pulse of strong monochromatic linearly polarized laser
radiation. In the dipole approximation the TDSE which describes this process
is:

H(r, t)ΨR(r, t) = i¯h

(27)

(28)

H(r, t) = H0(r) − er · f (t)cos(ωt)

f (t) ≡ ε0ekf (t).

Here f (t) is the function which describes the envelope of the laser pulse and
f (t) is a vector as deﬁned in Eq.24; ε0 is the laser’s amplitude, ek is a unit
vector in the direction of the electric component of the laser ﬁeld, ω is the
laser’s frequency, with T = 2π/ω the optical period. H0(r) is the ﬁeld-free
Hamiltonian and the vector operator r describes the internal degrees of freedom
(the coordinates are complex-scaled throughout) .

In the same spirit of subsection (2.1), we deﬁne the following operator

HF (r, t′, t′′) ≡

H(r, t′, t′′) − i¯h

− i¯h

∂t′

∂
∂t′′

e

H(r, t′, t′′) ≡ H0(r) − er · f (t′′)cos(ωt′)

e

and t′, t′′ should be regarded as additional coordinates. Upon complex-scaling
[23] HF (r, t′, t′′) becomes non-hermitian. Therefore the inner c-product should
be used as mentioned before. The quasi-energy solutions of this complex-scaled
Floquet-type operator are:

HF (r, t′, t′′)ψR

k (r, t′, t′′) = λkψR

k (r, t′, t′′)

H †∗F (r, t′, t′′)ψL

k (r, t′, t′′) = λkψL

k (r, t′, t′′)

where the symbol H †∗F doesn’t stand for an operator but for the transpose of
the matrix representing the operator HF . The eigenfunctions form a complete
set in the extended Hilbert space r, t′, t′′.

Say we want to solve the following TDSE with the initial state

Ψ(r, t′, t′′, t =

0):

ΨR(r, t′, t′′, t) = i¯h

Let us now return to the main purpose of this article, the derivation of the
adiabatic theorem for non-hermitian open systems. We would like to treat t′′ as
an adiabatic coordinate (this is the ”coordinate” associated with the pulse enve-
lope) in the same way that the electronic motion is separated from the nuclear
one in the treatment of molecules within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
First we deﬁne the following operator

Had(r, t′, t′′) ≡

H(r, t′, t′′) − i¯h

∂
∂t′

e
where t′′ should be regarded as a parameter now. This means that this Hamilto-
nian is a Floquet Hamiltonian describing the interaction of the atom with CW
laser of strength ε1 where following Eq.24

ε1 = |f (t)| = ε0f (t)

The eigenstates of this operator form a complete basis (in the r − t′ space),

for every value of the parameter t′′:

Had(r, t′, t′′)ψad,R

α

(r, t′, t′′) = εad

α (t′′)ψad,R

α

(r, t′, t′′).

(34)

Notice that due to the complex scaling, λk and εad

α (t′′) get complex values.

We can expand each eigenstate of the complete problem (Eq.27) in this basis:

ψR

k (r, t′, t′′) =

ψad,R
α′

(r, t′, t′′)χα′,k(t′′)

(35)

Xα′

Substituting Eq.35 into Eq.27, multiplying the obtained equation from the left
hand side by ψad,L
(r, t′, t′′) and integrating over r and t′ one gets, in matrix
notation, the equality:

α′

[−i¯h

[−→χ k(t′′)]α = χα,k(t′′).
Notice that in case that the matrix on the left hand side of Eq.36 is diagonal,
a homogeneous systems of uncoupled equations is obtained. In such a case one
should solve each equation separately. Therefore, the sum in Eq.35 reduces to
a single product. This is exactly the adiabatic approximation as appears in the
Born-Oppenheimer context. The next step in our derivation is to represent the
matrix (Ead(t′′) + V (t′′)) by its spectral decomposition

(37)

[Ead(t′′) + V (t′′)]DR(t′′) = DR(t′′)W (t′′)

[Ead(t′′) + V (t′′)]tDL(t′′) = DL(t′′)W (t′′)

The matrix of eigenvalues W (t′′) is diagonal and the right and left eigenvectors
are normalized with respect to each other in order to maintain the correct inner
product:

[DL(t′′)]tDR(t′′) = I

In the case that the matrix (Ead(t′′) + V (t′′)) is not strictly diagonal we can
use ﬁrst-order perturbation theory to get the ﬁrst-order deviation from diagonal.
If we treat the matrix V (t′′) as perturbation, we get

[V (t′′)]α′,α
α (t′′) − εad
εad
The matrix will be diagonal to a good approximation if

[DR(t′′)]α′,α = δα′,α +

Aα(t′′) ≡

The index α is a super-index; since (Eq.34) it is easily seen that not only is

(r, t′, t′′) a solution of the eigenvalue equation, with eigenvalue εad
α (t′′),
but also eiωmt
α (t′′) + ¯hωm,
for any integer m. Let us take all the states whose corresponding eigenvalues lie
in the interval [0, ¯hω] (the ﬁrst Brillouin zone) and deﬁne them to have index
m = 0; we call these states φad,L
(r, t′, t′′), φad,R
(r, t′, t′′) and the corresponding
eigenvalues Ead

(r, t′, t′′) is a solution, with the eigenvalue εad

j (t′′) and get:

Thus, the index α actually counts both the position of the quasienergy within
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (the index j) and the Brillouin zone itself (the index n).
With respect to the generalized inner product, two states with one or more of
the indices (j,n) diﬀerent are orthogonal.

Going back to Eq.45 now ,it is seen that the probability to couple an initial

j′ (t′′) are complex (the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian)
then for j 6= j′ it is most unlikely that Ead
j . It is clear that the denomi-
nator hardly ever vanishes even when m = 0. This holds true even when j = j′
but m 6= 0.

Therefore, the criteria for a pulse to be considered adiabatic is that the con-

dition

A(j,0)(t′′) ≪ 1

(54)

be fulﬁlled.
Who is the adiabatic state ψad

α=(j,0)(r, t′, t′′) whose couplings to all other
states ψad
α′=(j′,m′)(r, t′, t′′) should remain small in the adiabatic limit? Assuming
that the system is in a stationary state of the ﬁeld-free problem ϕj(r) before
the action of the ﬁeld (relaying on the superposition principle of the solutions
of the TDSE generality is not lost by this assumption) and provided that the
ﬁeld is switched adiabatically, this Floquet resonanace state ψad
α=(j,0)(r, t′, t′′) is
the state which is ”born” from the stationary state ϕj(r) as the ﬁeld is switched
on. If the process is not done adiabatically many Floquet resonanace states will
be populated, resulting in considerable couplings of ψad
α=(j,0)(r, t′, t′′) to them
and collapse of the adiabatic condition in Eq.54. The only adiabatic check
which is physically meaningful is one in which α denotes a resonance state
(which is associated with square-integrable function). α′ however stands for
both resonances and rotated continuum states.

One should notice that the derivation of the adiabatic theorem presented
above holds for many electron systems. In order to avoid complicated notation
the symbol r can stand for many electrons. It also holds for polychromatic radia-
tion, where the CW ﬁeld is a collection of monochromatic ﬁelds with frequencies
ωi and phases ϕi.

Notice that for a given problem (given spectral proﬁle of the CW ﬁeld and
given ﬁeld-free potential), the sum over absolute value of the adiabatic cross
terms should be calculated as function of the eﬀective CW-ﬁeld intensity (which
is symbolized here through t′′) only once. The adiabatic cross terms should
then be converted to be functions of time, through the explicit time dependence
of the pulse envelope and then the sum of their absolute values should be mul-
tiplied by the time derivative of the pulse envelope and by the maximal ﬁeld
intensity to obtain the ﬁnal expression which indicates whether the adiabatic
criteria is fulﬁlled or not.

It is easily seen in Eq.51 that for a given system, the shape and intensity of
the laser pulse determines its adiabaticity since these parameters inﬂuence the
shape-derivative term. A short pulse which is switched on or oﬀ abruptly and
has a high maximal intensity, will most likely not be adiabatic.

In the case that the adiabaticity criteria is fulﬁlled, the sum in Eq.35 could

be reduced to a single product:

k,j(r, t′, t′′) ∼= φad,R
ψR

j

(r, t′, t′′)χj,k(t′′)

and the adiabatic states are assigned with two good quantum numbers k and j.
The solution to the eigenvalue equation Eq.36 is now ([V (t′′)]α,α′ ≈ 0)

This is the adiabatic solution of the TDSE associated with initial state ϕj (r).
Let us summarize and clarify the procedure that need to be made in order
to determine if a pulse is adiabatic or not; The determination is carried out
through the calculation of the expression A(j,0)(t) (it is t now, not t” !):

(1) Perform non-hermitian adiabatic Floquet simulations (Eq.34) with CW
ﬁeld, for a range of intensities ε1 which covers all intensities between zero and
the maximal intensity ε0 that the studied laser pulse reaches. The adiabatic
Floquet Hamiltonian is therefore

Had(r, t′, ε1) ≡ H0(r) − er · ε1cos(ωt′) − i¯h

and the eigenvalue equation to be solved is

Obtain the quasienergy spectrum Ead
j (ε1) and all the adiabatic cross terms
c(j,0)
(j′,m)(ε1) as deﬁned in Eq.53,60 as function of the intensities. This stage is
done only once, for a given system.

(2) For a given laser pulse f (t) with a maximal intensity ε0, evaluate the
eﬀective CW-ﬁeld intensity as function of time ε0f (t) (Eq.24). Then, convert
the adiabatic cross terms to be functions of time via the equality (Eq.33)

ε1 = ε0f (t).

A(j,0)(t) is smaller then unity at every instant, it is guaranteed that the system

adiabatically to that resonance. In this case the HGS spectra will show only
odd harmonics and the ionization probability as function of time will have a
simple form that will be shown.

4 Illustrative numerical example

We studied a single-electron 1D Xe atom subjected to a single sin-square pulse
of strong monochromatic laser ﬁeld in two approaches. In the ﬁrst one hermitian
simulations were carried out whereas in the second non-hermitian Floquet sim-
ulations based on the complex scaling method were carried out. The hermitian
simulations were carried out by solving the following TDSE

and the ﬁeld-free eﬀective potential V0(x) was an inverse Gaussian

V0(x) = −0.63 exp(−0.1424x2)

which supports two bound states that mimic the two lowest electronic states
of Xe, with energies E0 = −0.4451a.u., E1 = −0.1400a.u. and a third weakly
bound state with energy E2 = −0.00014a.u.

The wave function was taken initially at the ground state (g.s.) of the ﬁeld-

free Hamiltonian of the system:

Ψ(x, t = 0) = ϕ1(x)

(65)

and was calculated for times 0 < t < N T (single sine-square pulse, N was the
number of optical cycles that entered the pulse). Using this wavefunction the

ionization probability at times t = π

these times the potential felt by the electron was the ﬁeld-free potential V0(x))

(66)

where ϕi were the bound states of the ﬁeld-free problem (3 bound states over
which we summed in this example). Also HGS was calculated, which follow-
ing the classical-quantum correspondence principle (Larmor formula,[24]) equals
the modulus-square of the Fourier-transformed time-dependent acceleration ex-
pectation value. This is actually the intensity of the radiation emitted by the
oscillating electron as presented in energy space.

The non-hermitian simulations were Floquet simulations which were carried
out for diﬀerent ﬁeld intensities. The quasienergy spectrum of complex energies
j′ (ε1) and the adiabatic cross terms c(j,0)
Ead
(j′,m)(ε1) were calculated for each inten-
sity. Then, these quantities were expressed as function of time through Eq.33,
1(ε1/ε0). It was veriﬁed that in the cases where the adiabatic crite-
i.e. t = f −
ria was fulﬁlled, the HGS obtained from the hermitian propagation simulation
contained only odd harmonics. A more quantitative measure of the existence of
the adiabatic criteria was obtained through the comparison of ionization prob-
abilities as obtained from the hermitian propagation simulation and the non
hermitian simulation.

In order to get non-hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian, the complex coordinate

method was used. The Floquet Hamiltonian (Eq.59)

was found to be so when the ionization probabilities, as computed in the two
simulations, were compared; The ionization probability at each instant was given
by the following expression, which was obtained using Eq.58 and the F-product
deﬁnition for the inner product [13]:

Pion(t) = e−

(70)

where Γ1(τ ) was associated with the Floquet resonanace state that was ”born”
from the ground stationary state ϕ1(r) as the ﬁeld was turned on. The res-
onances that were ”born” from the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian bound states were
identiﬁed by plotting the quasienergy spectrum as function of the eﬀective ﬁeld
intensity ε1. The resonance complex quasienergy trajectories started from the
ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian bound states real energies and formed continuous trajec-
tories in the complex energy plane as function of the intensity.

How was this expression for the ionization probability obtained? Accord-
ing to the F-product deﬁnition when the complex energy given in Eq.69 is

and also this function decays with time. When the F-product of ΨL(r, t) and
ΨR(r, t) is calculated (this is an overlap integral without complex conjugation of
the left state; in the usual dirac-product notation this reads hΨL
∗(t)|ΨR(t)i) the
terms containing the real part of the energy cancel each other and the overlap
integral (c-product) of the adiabatic Floquet states gives unity (remember the
completeness property of Floquet states also in coordinate space alone). The
expression in Eq.70 is obtained for the speciﬁc case that only the Floquet reso-
nance state which is ”born” from the ﬁeld-free bound state is populated. When
several Floquet states are populated the same type of calculation could be re-
peated, where this time ΨL(r, t) and ΨR(r, t) are given by liner combination
of terms as in Eq.71 with the proper coeﬃcients. Since the adiabatic Floquet
states are orthogonal to each other, a generalization of the result of Eq.70 is
obtained:

Notice that in the non-hermitian formalism the norm is not conserved but decays
with time; it contains the knowledge about decay processes inherently.

The two functions as given in Eq.66,70 were compared and it was found
that the resemblance between the functions increased as the adiabatic limit was
increasingly reached by the laser pulse parameters.

The numerical method used to solve the TDSE with hermitian Hamiltonian
was the split operator Forest-Ruth algorithm with 7 points [25]; The grid size,
time step and/or grid step were adjusted as required to achieve convergence.
For the non-hermitian Floquet simulation, the (t,t’) formalism was used, with
the complex coordinate method. The number of basis functions, box length and
scaling angle were adjusted as required to achieve convergence.

In Fig.1 the HGS as obtained for pulse strength of ε0 = 0.035a.u. (corre-
sponding to intensity of 4.30·1013W/cm2), pulse-durations of N = 5, 10, 50 opti-
cal cycles, laser frequencies of ω = 0.015a.u., 0.07a.u., 0.11a.u. (corresponding to
energies of ¯hω = 0.408eV, 1.90eV, 2.99eV and wavelengths of λ = 3040nm, 651nm,
414nm, respectively) and initial state ϕ1(x) are shown. The appearance of odd
harmonics and the absence of even or non-integer harmonics, is in general the
main feature which appears for long pulses, regardless of the frequency. The odd

15

harmonics are obtained even for the shortest laser pulses although the existence
of odd-symmetry selection rules is sensitive to the frequency: some deviation
appears at frequency of ω = 0.07a.u. and the obtained spectra is more compli-
cated.

In Fig.2 the complex quasienergies of the 3 resonances which are ”born”
from the 3 bound states of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian (will be given indices 1-
3 from now on), as obtained from adiabatic Floquet simulations (Eq.60) for
ω = 0.11a.u. are shown as function of the CW-ﬁeld strength ε1. Notice that the
lifetimes of these resonances are not monotonic functions of the ﬁeld intensity.
It should be noted that these were not the only resonances that appeared in the
quasienergy spectrum; there were also other resonances which didn’t emerge
from the ﬁeld-free bound states. However, as will be shown in Fig.4, in this
case for not too large ﬁeld intensities resonances 1-3 were the only important
resonances and they alone determined the dynamical behavior of the system.

In Fig.3 the ionization probability as obtained from the hermitian simulation
(Eq.66) with pulse strength of ε0 = 0.035a.u., pulse-durations of N = 5, 10, 50
optical cycles, laser frequency of ω = 0.11a.u. and initial state ϕ1(x), is com-
pared to the ionization probability as obtained from the expression given in
Eq.70, which is derived from the F-product formalism together with the res-
onances quasienergies obtained from the non-hermitian simulation. It is seen
that as the pulse becomes longer the results obtained from the two simulations
become identical.

Both results of HGS and ionization probabilities showed that the time-
dependent wavefunction of the studied systems could be well approximated by
the adiabatic expression given in Eq.58, even for short pulses. The values of the
terms which check the adiabatic criteria, as seen in Fig.6, gave the explanation
why this was so.

(3), a(2)

(2), a(1)

In Fig.4 the expressions a(1)

(3) (Eq.52) which describe the couplings
between every two resonances from the set of 3 tracked resonances is shown
as function of the CW-ﬁeld strength ε1, for the case ω = 0.11a.u.. It can be
seen that the coupling between resonances 1 and 2 is strong for ﬁeld strength
of ε1 ≃ 0.04a.u., 0.064a.u. and 0.072a.u.. This could be partially explained on
the basis of the values of the quasienergies, as seen in Fig.2, at least for two
ﬁeld strengths out of the three. It is seen that for ﬁeld strength of 0.04a.u. and
0.064a.u. the real parts of the quasienergies cross, resulting in small value of
the denominator in the expression given in Eq.53 for c(1,0)
(2,m) (at least for one m
term). In the same way the strong couplings between resonances 1 and 3 at ﬁeld
strength of ε1 = 0.064a.u., and between resonances 2 and 3 at ﬁeld strength of
ε1 = 0.066a.u. could be explained on the basis of the quasienergy values at these
ﬁeld-strengths. In particular it should be noticed that the couplings between
resonances 1 and 3 at ε1 = 0.064a.u. are the strongest among all 3 resonances
due to the close values of both real and imaginary parts of the quasienergies.
However, it should be noted that crossings in the quaisenergy plot are not always
indications of large couplings since also the overlap between the wavefunctions
(the nominator of the expression for c(j,0)

(j′,m)) is important.

In Fig.5 the sum

(2)(ε1) + a(1)

(j′)(ε1) which describes the couplings between all
quasistates of the system α′ = (j′, m) to resonance 1 α = (1, 0) is shown as func-
tion of the CW-ﬁeld strength ε1, for the case ω = 0.11a.u.. In addition, also the
partial sum a(1)
(3)(ε1) which describes the couplings between resonances
2 and 3 to the resonance state α = (1, 0) is shown. It can be shown that up to a
moderate intensity of ε1 ∼ 0.04a.u. the ﬁrst resonance is mainly coupled only to
the other 2 resonances and not to other, higher resonances or continuum states.
The entire dynamics is governed almost solely by the 3 resonances which are
”born” from the 3 bound states of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian.

The sums described above, which are functions of a CW-ﬁeld strength ε1,
are converted to be explicit functions of time for the speciﬁc sine-square pulse
with maximal intensity ε0 = 0.035a.u. used in the simulation (Fig.5, upper
part). For this purpose for each time t 0 < t < N T the eﬀective CW-ﬁeld
strength 0.035f (t) is calculated and the values of the 2 functions shown in Fig.5
which ﬁt this eﬀective CW-ﬁeld strength are taken. Hence the 2 sum functions
are converted to be explicit functions of time. In the middle part of Fig.6 the
full term A(1,0)(t), which represents the degree of adiabaticity in the process of
shining a 1D Xe atom initially at the ground state with a sine-square laser pulse
supporting N = 5 optical cycles of monochromatic radiation with frequency
ω = 0.11a.u. and strength ε0 = 0.035a.u., is shown as function of time. It is
3 for all times,
seen that the term A(1,0)(t) is bounded by the value of ∼ 2 · 10−
whether it is calculated by coupling of the ﬁrst resonance to other 2 resonances
only or to all other states. The structure of the HHS for N = 5 seen in Fig.1
implies that this value is indeed small and the process is adiabatic. In the lower
part of Fig.6 the same quantity is shown, but for ω = 0.07a.u.. Here it is seen the
1 for all times and
terms A(1,0)(t) are bounded by a much larger value of ∼ 10−
the more complex structure of the HHS for N = 5 seen in Fig.1 implies that this
value is not small enough to indicate the appearance of an adiabatic process. It
should be noted that for a given system with ﬁeld-strength ε0, frequency ω and
sine-square pulse envelope, we have F (t) = |e|( ¯hε0ω
N )|. Therefore, as the
number of optical cycles the pulse supports increases the general shape of the
terms A(1,0)(t) is kept the same but is attenuated. Therefore, for ω = 0.07a.u. as
N gets bigger, the pulse’s envelope varies more slowly and the process becomes
more and more adiabatic, as seen in the HHS spectra for N = 50 for example.

5 Conclusions

With the help of the (t,t’) formalism we derive an adiabatic theorem for open
systems. The use of the complex scaling transformation plays a key role in
our derivation. For example, the spectrum of the Floquet Hamiltonian of
an open system is changed dramatically. Rather than a continuous spectrum
that is responsible for the absence of an adiabatic limit for N (number of basis
functions)→ ∞ in the conventional QM, the resonances are associated with a
point spectrum and are separated from the continuum which is rotated into the
lower half of the complex energy plane.

17

An interesting important numerical result of our derivation is that the cal-
culation of the eﬀect of the pulses’s shape on the dynamics does not require
heavy computations. The entire eﬀect of the laser pulse is embedded in a mul-
tiplication factor of df (t)/dt where ε0f (t) is the variation of the maximum ﬁeld
amplitude as function of time.

As a numerical example we applied the adiabatic theorem we derived to
a model Hamiltonian of Xe atom (with symmetric ﬁeld-free potential) which
interacts with strong, monochromatic laser pulses. We have shown that the
generation of odd-order harmonics and the absence of even-order harmonics,
even when the pulses are extremely short, can be explained with the help of the
adiabatic theorem we derived.

The use of a single-electron 1D model to describe a realistic atom is justiﬁed
since it has been shown before in many cases that all the main strong ﬁeld
eﬀects are reproduced. Therefore the conclusions obtained with this model are
also valid for a realistic atom.

Figure 1:
(color online) HGS obtained from hermitian simulations describing
a 1D Xe atom subjected to various sin-square pulses with strength of ε0 =
0.035a.u., laser frequencies of ω = 0.015a.u. (upper part), ω = 0.07a.u. (middle
part) and ω = 0.11a.u. (lower part) and pulse-durations of N = 5 (solid), 10
(dot-dashed) and 50 (solid-dotted) optical cycles. The initial state was taken to
be the ground state in all simulations. For the longest pulse duration only odd
harmonics appear in the spectrum, and hyper Raman lines are absent. This is
also the basic feature in the case of short pulses, although some deviation from
this structure appear at frequency of ω = 0.07a.u..

the two simulations become identical since the adiabaticity of the process is
increased.

Both terms are bounded by a larger value of ∼ 10−

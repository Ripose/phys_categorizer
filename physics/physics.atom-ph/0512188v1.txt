Abstract

A simple method to include the strong force in atom–antiatom scattering is pre-
sented. It is based on the strong-force scattering length between the nucleon and
antinucleon. Using this method elastic and annihilation cross sections are calculated
for hydrogen–antihydrogen and helium–antihydrogen scattering. The results are
compared to ﬁrst-order perturbation theory using a pseudo potential. The pseudo-
potential approach works fairly well for hydrogen–antihydrogen scattering, but fails
for helium-antihydrogen scattering where strong-force eﬀects are more prominent.

Key words: Antihydrogen, antimatter, scattering, annihilation.
PACS: 36.10.-k, 34.50.-s

Antimatter in contact with matter causes annihilation – a violent process
where mass is converted to energy. This is well known, even among people
who never have studied physics antimatter annihilation seems to stimulate
the imagination. In popular ﬁlms and literature antimatter is used as e.g. an
energy source, fuel for space ships, or a weapon. However, since the energy
required to create antimatter outweighs the energy created by annihilation
by many orders of magnitude, neither of these applications are possible in
reality. More realistically, antimatter may have applications in medicine, such
as antiproton treatment of cancer.

The primary goal for antimatter research is not futuristic applications, but
to uncover the symmetries (or possible asymmetries) of the fundamental laws
of physics. One could expect that the matter and antimatter contents of the
universe would be symmetric, but so far observations indicate that at least in
the neighborhood of our galaxy there is only matter. Today the coexistence of
matter and antimatter is ruled out on scales . 20 Mpc [1]. The reason for this
matter–antimatter asymmetry could be a violation of the CPT theorem. This

theorem, and other matter–antimatter symmetries, could be tested through
high-precision measurements on antihydrogen. Two experiments at CERN,
ATHENA and ATRAP, have succeeded in creating antihydrogen atoms, but
much work remains before CPT tests can be carried out [3].

Despite the interests in antimatter of both scientists and the general public,
relatively little is known about the interaction between atoms made of anti-
matter and ordinary atoms. So far no experimental data exist, and theoretical
work has only just started. Atom-antiatom scattering has practical implica-
tions for antihydrogen experiments, e.g. unwanted scattering of antiatoms on
impurities or on the walls of the experiment, or scattering on ultracold atoms
introduced on purpose to achieve sympathetic cooling of antimatter. Atom–
antiatom scattering is also interesting in its own right, being a new fundamen-
tal process involving both atomic and low-energy nuclear physics.

A number of inelastic processes are possible in atom-antiatom scattering:
nucleus-antinucleus annihilation, electron-positron annihilation, rearrangement
processes (such as formation of positronium), and even formation of metastable
“molecules”. The most important of these are nucleus-antinucleus annihila-
tion and rearrangement. Rearrangement processes will also eventually lead
to annihilation, but on a time scale much longer than the time required for
the ﬁnal-state fragments to separate. Hence, it can be regarded as a process
distinct from the “direct” annihilation during the collision. Alternatively, re-
arrangement can be regarded as a resonance in the annihilation channel. In
this paper I will focus on the direct annihilation process, while rearrangement
is discussed extensively elsewhere in these proceedings [4].

At large internuclear separations R the wave function of the atom-antiatom
system with relative angular momentum l is given by

where ψ ¯H and φatom are the atomic wave functions of antihydrogen and the

tum in the initial state. Both elastic and annihilation cross sections are given
by the complex phase shift δl [2],

At low temperatures (. 1 K) only the l = 0 partial wave contributes, and the

We ﬁrst note that the elastic cross section is constant at low energies, while
the annihilation cross section diverges as k−1
. Thus, below a certain energy
annihilation dominates. Second, we note that σel depends on both α and β.
This means that a non-zero imaginary part β of the scattering length, arising
from the inclusion of the strong nuclear force, will not only give rise to anni-
hilation, but will also signiﬁcantly modify the elastic cross section. Only if the
annihilation cross section is small, β

, this eﬀect may be ignored.

The simplest way to calculate the annihilation cross section is to use a pseudo
potential

Va(R) = Aδ(R).

This is a contact interaction with strength given by the constant A. This con-
stant can be determined from experimental data on the nucleus-antinucleus
system, or it can be calculated from model potentials. Using the pseudo poten-
tial in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory the annihilation cross section becomes

The pseudo-potential approach, being based on ﬁrst-order perturbation the-
ory, does not take into account the modiﬁcation of the initial channel due
to the strong force. Even if annihilation cannot be treated perturbatively one
may still use the zero-range approximation of the strong force, since the atomic
nucleus is very small on an atomic scale. The detailed shape of the strong-
force potential will therefore not matter, only its strength as parameterized by
a short-range strong-force phase shift δsf . Furthermore, atomic energies (eV)
are very small compared to typical nuclear energies (MeV). The strong-force
phase shift can therefore be parameterized by a strong-force scattering length
asf . This scattering length is complex, with the imaginary part representing
annihilation.

→

The role of the strong-force scattering length can be understood by looking at
the boundary condition of the wave function at short internuclear separations,
R
0. In the absence of the strong force, the wave function has a short-
distance form proportional to the regular Coulomb function for zero angular
momentum F0(kR). Even when the strong force is added the wave function
1a0, where R0 is just outside the range of the
is Coulombic for R0 ≤
strong force. But now, since the Coulombic solution is not extended all the way
to R = 0, also the irregular Coulomb function G0(kR) is allowed. A general
eigensolution to the zero-angular momentum Coulomb problem is an arbitrary
linear combination of F0(kR) and G0(kR). For atom-antiatom scattering in
the presence of the strong nuclear force the appropriate short-range form of
the scattering function is given by a particular solution determined by the
strong-force phase shift δsf

Here ϕ(ri) is the wave function of the leptons in the combined electric ﬁeld of
the overlapping nucleus and antinucleus. The wave vector k is related to ki as
~2k2/(2µ) = ~2k2
Ef , where Ef is the leptonic energy corresponding
to ϕ(ri). Since R0 is very small on an atomic scale, the boundary condition
of Φ at R0 may be expressed in terms of the short-range expansions of the

These forms have the advantage that they are independent of R0, provided
that R0 is small enough. The normalization factors ensure that Φreg and Φirreg

scattering including the strong nuclear force is found to be

cot δ0 =

Nreg cos δreg −
Nreg sin δreg −

asf /bµNirreg cos δirreg
asf /bµNirreg sin δirreg

.

Here the approximation kR0 →
0 has been used. With this equation we arrive
at a very simple way of calculating the strong-force eﬀects beyond the pseudo
potential in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. In addition to the usual regular
solution (16), an additional irregular solution given by the boundary condition
(17) has to be calculated. The asymptotic forms of the two solutions is then
weighted according to (20) using the strong-force scattering length.

The scattering length method has several advantages. It is very easy to im-
plement numerically. It makes no assumptions about the detailed form of the
strong-force potential, and is hence model independent. Alternatively one may
directly use Eq. (9), in combination with Eq. (13), as a short-range boundary
condition, and integrate towards R =
. This was the procedure in Refs.
[7,13,16]. The present formulation in terms of Eq. (20) has the advantage that
it clearly brings out the relation between the atom-antiatom phase shift δ0

and the strong-force scattering length asf , in terms of a minimal number of
parameters. The parameters Nreg, Nirreg, δreg, and δirreg are independent of the
strong force. Once they have been determined from an atom-antiatom calcu-
lation, it is a trivial task to calculate δ0 for a given strong-force scattering
length.

respectively.

For H– ¯H the pseudo-potential approach works quite well. As has been re-
ported earlier, the low-energy annihilation cross section using the pseudo-
potential approach is 0.14/√ǫi a2
0 [12], while the scattering length approach
gives 0.15/√ǫi a2

ment with a calculation by Armour et al. [14],using the optical potential of
Kohno and Weise [15], who obtained 0.12/√ǫi a2
0 for the triplet state and
0 for the singlet state. The elastic cross section changes from 771 a2

For He– ¯H scattering the situation is quite diﬀerent. The strong force has
a drastic inﬂuence on the elastic cross section. This is in part because the
real part of the scattering length happens to have an untypically low value
5 a0). The elastic
α =
cross section without the strong force is therefore only 0.65 a0, but changes
drastically to 1700 a2
0 when the strong force is included. This is reﬂected by the
scattering length a = (2.2
11.4i) a0 , which has an imaginary part much larger
than the real part. The annihilation cross section changes from 0.95/√ǫi a2
0
in the pseudo-potential approach to 2.62/√ǫi a2
0 in the scattering-length ap-
proach.

These results replace those in Ref. [16] which were based on the potential
in Ref. [17]. This potential had been calculated at fewer R-values, giving in-
terpolation problems in the cross section calculations. Rather surprisingly,
the eﬀect of this reﬁnement of the potential on both elastic and annihilation
cross sections was quite large. The scattering length reported in Ref. [16] was
a = (
0. The
increase of the calculated annihilation cross section with a factor three can
almost entirely be attributed to the range R . 1.5a0 of the potential. The
diﬀerence between the old and the new potential is very small, at most about
0.007 a.u. (at R = 0.8a0), showing the extreme sensitivity of the scattering

length to the details of the potential. Although this is a small correction, it is
still 20 times larger than the maximum of the adiabatic correction [11], which
on the contrary only has a small impact on the scattering length.

The validity of the scattering length approach has been tested for the H– ¯H
system using a model potential with the form [6]

Here A is the nuclear mass number, b0 a complex parameter, µ the antiproton-
nucleon reduced mass, m the mass of the nucleon, and ρ(R) the nuclear mass
density, which was taken to have a Gaussian form with width rG. Three diﬀer-
ent widths were used, rG = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 fm, and for each width the parameter
b0 was adjusted until the potential reproduced the scattering length above. All
three potentials thus obtained gave results identical to the scattering-length
approach, to within three signiﬁcant digits [7]. This clearly shows that the
shape of the potential does not matter, and all its relevant properties can be
summarized by the complex strong-force scattering length asf .

In conclusion I have developed a simple method to take the strong force into
account in situations when the pseudo-potential method cannot be applied.
This is the case in He– ¯H scattering, where annihilation is fast, and the elas-
tic cross section is drastically modiﬁed by the strong force. In the future this
method may be used to investigate scaling properties of elastic and annihila-
tion cross sections for scattering of antihydrogen on heavier atoms.

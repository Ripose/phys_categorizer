Abstract

Hyperspherical partial wave theory has been applied here in the study of photo double
ionization of the helium atom for equal energy sharing geometry at 20 eV excess energy.
Calculations have been done both in length and velocity gauges and are found to agree
nicely with each other, with the CCC results and with experiments and exhibit some
advantages of the corresponding three particle wave function over other wave functions in
use.

1. Introduction

There has been a signiﬁcant development in the last one decade in the theoretical
study of photo double ionization (PDI) of the helium atom. This was possible because
of rapid developments in the experimental side by several groups, extending over several
countries. Photo double ionization of the helium atom is one of the most basic atomic
processes. Even then, this problem merits a detailed study as it involves complex three
body eﬀects and electron correlations. The available total cross section results of several
good theories although agree among themselves, fail to agree with experiments [1] above
1 Rydberg of excess photon energy. As regards diﬀerential cross sections the situation is
far more complex (for a review see [2, 3]).

In the time-independent frame work the solution of the problem depends basically

co-ordinates of the two outgoing electrons, the nucleus being at the origin.

For accurate cross section results one needs accurate wave functions Φi and Ψ(−)
.
Accurate bound state helium wave functions are easily available. There exists a number
of such wave functions for the ground state (and low-lying excited states) in analytic
form of diﬀerent accuracies, such as simple Hartree Fock type wave function used by
Maulbetsch and Briggs [4] or a Hylleraas type wave function given by Chandrashekhar
and Herzberg [5] or by Hart and Herzberg [6]. If needed, one may also readily generate
an arbitrarily accurate bound state wave function along the line developed by Pekeris [7].
But for Ψ(−)
there are no such simple accurate wavefunctions in analytical form. Most
wave functions used in the literature are either incorrect in the asymptotic domain, or at
ﬁnite distances as 3C or 2SC [16, 17] wave functions. There are now many calculations of
varied accuracies depending mainly on the use of diﬀerent ﬁnal channel wave functions.
Without caring for the explicit form of the wave functions, Huetz and co-workers
established dependence of cross sections on various angular variables of the outgoing
electrons and on energy. For equal energy sharing geometry case it turns out to be
rather simple in form. On least squares ﬁtting this gives good representation of the
triple diﬀerential cross section(TDCS) results [11] (some authors prefer the name ﬁve
fold diﬀerential cross sections (FDCS)which is more appropriate and relevant in view of
some recent experimental results [12]. However, we will continue to call it TDCS).

For the study of TDCS close to threshold there are the Wannier calculations by
Faegin [13, 14]. These give good representation of the shape of TDCS results at 6 eV
excess energy but miserably fail at higher energies.

There are also a number of detailed calculations by Maulbetsch and Briggs [4, 15]
which used for the ﬁnal state wave function, the 3C wave function of BBK theory [16] and
produced moderately accurate cross section results. It is well known that the 3C wave
function is correct in the asymptotic domain, but not accurate enough at ﬁnite distances.
Similar calculations are reported by Pont and Shakeshaft [1, 17, 18]. They used screened
coulomb (2SC) wave functions (for the outgoing electrons) which is supposed to be a

2

better wave function (but not asymptotically exact). The results are better, but not
accurate enough.

Later Lucey et al [2] tried various initial state and ﬁnal state wave functions, including
the 3C wave function (none accurate enough), tested gauge dependence and found much
discrepancies in the results. Recently a very powerful theory, the hyperspherical R-
matrix with semiclassical outgoing partial waves (HRM-SOW) theory [19, 20] has been
proposed. However this theory has not yet been extensively applied.

Perhaps the most extensively applied theory in the context of PDI problems is the
CCC theory of Kheifets and Bray [21 - 25]. No doubt the CCC approach yielded good
results but it has a number of diﬃculties apparent, for example, from their discussion
in the introduction of their article [21]. The CCC calculations treat the two outgoing
electrons in an asymmetric form, one electron sees a nuclear charge Z = 1 and the other
sees a nuclear charge Z = 2 and hence the ﬁnal state wave function is not asymptotically
correct. Absolute cross sections cannot be obtained without minor manipulations. The
calculated single diﬀerential cross sections (SDCS) need to be rescaled to the true SDCS
(either known from experiments or from other theory). Moreover there is the pseudo-
resonance problem (see Br¨auning et al [11] p 5153). All these make the CCC approach
less attractive, even if it leads to good cross section results.

Most recently, the time-dependent close-coupling (TDCC) method has been applied
to the PDI problem and reported some exceptionally good cross section results [26]. This
method also involves heavy numerical computations.

In this work, we consider yet another high level computational scheme which is capa-
ble of yielding reliable cross sections. This is the Hyperspherical partial wave approach
of one of the authors (Das [27 - 30], Das et al [31]) and is very successful in describing
electron - hydrogen ionization collisions [31]. The initial helium ground state used here
is a 20-term correlated Hylleraas type wave function of the form

2. Hyperspherical Partial Wave Theory

In this section we outline the most salient features of this method. For the ﬁnal
state Ψ(−)
, which needs more accurate treatment, we use hyperspherical co-coordinates
f
R = √r1
2, α = atan(r2/r1), ˆr1 = (θ1, φ1), ˆr2 = (θ2, φ2) and ω = (α, ˆr1, ˆr2) and
2 + r2
2, α0 = atan(p2/p1), ˆp1 = (θp1, φp1), ˆp2 = (θp2, φp2) and ω0 =
2 + p2
put P =
p1
(α0, ˆp1, ˆp2), ~p1, ~p2 being momenta of the two outgoing electrons of energies E1 and E2.

We expand Ψ(−)
in hyperspherical harmonics (Das [27], Lin [32]) which are functions of
the above ﬁve angular variables and depend on the variables ℓ1, ℓ2, n, L, M (collectively
called λ) which are respectively the angular momenta of the two electrons, the order of
the Jacobi polynomial and the total angular momentum and its projection, in addition
to the dependence on S, the total spin. It may be noted that L, S, π (the parity) are
conserved here.

Thus we decompose Ψ(−)

For our numerical computations we truncate each set to some maximum value Nmx of
N. These Nmx equations in Nmx variables are needed to be solved from origin to inﬁnity.
Actually we need construction of Nmx independent solutions which vanish at the origin.
Now for convenience we divide the whole solution domain (0,
) into three subdomains
(0, ∆), (∆, R∞) and (R∞,
), where ∆ has the value of a few atomic units and R∞
is a point in the asymptotic domain. Best choices for these may be made by simple

over the other subdomains. For (R∞,

where f (k)
csN are the N-th element of the k-th solution vectors. Obviously
these give 2Nmx independent solution vectors. The coeﬃcients in these expressions
are determined through recurrence relations (see Das [27]) in terms of a(0)
kN = akN and
kN = 0, c(0)
b(0)
kN = akN , akN being the N-th element of the k-th eigen vector of
the charge matrix A = (αN N ′). Here we have θk = ρ + αkln 2ρ, αk being the k-th eigen
value of A.

kN = 0, d(0)

Solution over (∆, R∞) is also very simple. Because of the simple structure of equations
(9) a Taylors expansion method works nicely. In earlier (e, 2e) problems Das also adopted
this approach [29, 30]. But the main diﬃculty lies in the construction of the solution
vectors over (0, ∆). In those calculations on (e, 2e) problems Das used an approach as in
R-matrix calculations [33]. But very often, this invites pseudo resonance type behaviour
causing undesirable oscillations in the cross sections. So we adopted here a new approach
and we ﬁnd it to be free from such problems.

Thus for the solution in the interval (0, ∆) we recast equations (9) in terms of R

instead of ρ, as

and solve these equations as a two point boundary value problem by diﬀerence equation
method. At R = 0, the solution vectors are set to zero while at R = ∆ we assign to the k-
th solution vector the k-th column of the unit matrix. The matrix for the corresponding
diﬀerence equation is a sparse matrix and for its solution special methods are available.
Here we use biconjugate gradient method [34]. We ﬁnd that this method readily works
and gives converged solutions.

Now for the diﬀerence equations we divide the interval [0, ∆] into m subintervals of

length h with mesh points

error terms. The corresponding diﬀerence equations are obtained by substituting these
expressions the values of second order derivatives from the diﬀerential equation (12). For
continuing these solutions in the domain (∆, R∞) we need ﬁrst order derivatives f ′

Here too, the quantity within curly brackets represents the error term. The solutions
thus obtained in (0, ∆) are then continued over (∆, R∞) by Taylor’s expansion method, as
stated earlier, with stabilization after suitable steps [35]. The Nmx independent solution
vectors so obtained, are put together to get the solution matrix f0. The solution matrices
snN and f (k)
fsn and fcs are similarly obtained, whose N-kth element are respectively f (k)
csN ,
given by (10) and (11) respectively.

Next we introduce the K-matrix through the relation

B = fsn + fcs

where B is an unknown constant matrix. The K-matrix is determined from matching
values and ﬁrst order derivatives at R∞, where all of f0, fsn and fcs are valid. (It may
be noted here that there is a slight departure in our deﬁnition of K-matrix from the usual
practice. However, it is symmetric as it should be).

Finally the physical scattering state with appropriate boundary conditions is taken

Thus the physical state is completely determined once the vector c is determined. Now c
is determined from the consideration that Ψ(−)
f s is asymptotically a (distorted) plane wave
(representing the two outgoing electrons) plus incoming waves only. So the coeﬃcients
of the outgoing wave exp(iρ) of both Ψ(−)
f s and the symmetrized plane wave (equation
(5)) must be the same (except for the distorting term exp(iαkln 2ρ)). This requires

Finally the PDI triple diﬀerential cross section turns out to be of the form

3. Results

In our present calculation we have applied the above hyperspherical partial wave ap-
proach both in length and velocity gauges. We have chosen ∆ = 5 a.u., R0 = 200
a.u., h = 0.05 a.u. upto ∆ and 0.1 a.u. beyond ∆. We have included 90 cou-
pled channels with n upto 9 and (l1, l2) combinations nearly as in ECS calculation
[36] for electron - hydrogen ionization collision. We have chosen the case of ioniza-
tion at 20 eV excess energy as it has been widely considered and for which there
are interesting experimental results. For the present calculations with 90 channels
and R0 = 200 a.u., our single diﬀerential cross section (SDCS) is little above the
desired value of about 0.93 Kb/eV at E/2 (E being the excess photon energy). So
we normalized our TDCS by scaling with a factor 0.8 (which is also the factor we

7

use to scale our SDCS to get the desired value of 0.93 Kb/eV at E/2) both in the
length and in the velocity gauges. The TDCS results thus obtained are presented in
ﬁgure 1. Here we compare our results with the experimental results of Br¨auning et al
[11] and with the theoretical results of the CCC calculation.
In all cases the agree-
ment between the velocity and length gauge calculation is excellent everywhere, except
near the peaks where the length gauge results are slightly larger. Agreement with the
experimental results and with the CCC results are also good. It is interesting to note
that except for θ1 = 0o (where there are slight departures) our results when multiplied
by a factor 0.6 (instead of 0.8) are nearly equal to the CCC results both in shape and in
magnitude.

4. Conclusions

The present calculation reported here has approximately converged. For fully con-
verged results more computational resources may be necessary. The results we have
obtained, go to show that the hyperspherical three-particle scattering state wave func-
tion used in the present calculation must be reasonably accurate from small distances
to the asymptotic region, since the results in both length and velocity gauges are nearly
identical. In contrast, the 3C or other similar wave functions, which are not accurate
at ﬁnite distances, show strong gauge dependence [2]. We also mention that the present
calculation is free from any genuine diﬃculties and does not show any weakness worth
mentioning. If we recall the capability of the hyperspherical partial wave theory in repre-
senting electron-hydrogen-atom ionization collisions[29, 30, 31] and consider the present
success, we may expect the hyperspherical partial wave theory to have a very good
prospect.

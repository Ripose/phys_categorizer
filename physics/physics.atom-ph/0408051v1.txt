Abstract

Within the theory of Siegert pseudostates, it is possible to accurately calculate bound states

and resonances. The energy continuum is replaced by a discrete set of states. Many questions

of interest in scattering theory can be addressed within the framework of this formalism, thereby

avoiding the need to treat the energy continuum. For practical calculations it is important to

know whether a certain subset of Siegert pseudostates comprises a basis. This is a nontrivial issue,

because of the unusual orthogonality and overcompleteness properties of Siegert pseudostates.

Using analytical and numerical arguments, it is shown that the subset of bound states and outgoing

Siegert pseudostates forms a basis. Time evolution in the context of Siegert pseudostates is also

investigated. From the Mittag-Leﬄer expansion of the outgoing-wave Green’s function, the time-

dependent expansion of a wave packet in terms of Siegert pseudostates is derived. In this expression,

all Siegert pseudostates—bound, antibound, outgoing, and incoming—are employed. Each of these

evolves in time in a nonexponential fashion. Numerical tests underline the accuracy of the method.

where V0 > 0 and a > 0.

In order to ﬁnd real-energy solutions, one normally matches

the wave function inside the well to a superposition of incoming and outgoing plane waves

outside the well (or to an exponentially damped function in the case of a bound state).

Following Siegert [1], however, we require that the solution for r

a is proportional to

If, in addition, we demand vanishing of the wave function at the origin, the wave number k

must satisfy the following relation:

ik =

k2 + 2V0 cot (

k2 + 2V0a) .

This transcendental equation can be solved for only a discrete set of k values. As was

done, for instance, in Ref.

[2], we solve Eq.

(3) numerically, after setting V0 = 5 and

a = 10. The resulting discrete k spectrum is presented in Fig. 1. There are 10 bound

states, which appear on the positive imaginary axis. The nine antibound states lie on the

negative imaginary axis. The solutions with Re(k) > 0 are associated with outgoing Siegert

pseudostates. Similarly, states with Re(k) < 0 refer to incoming Siegert pseudostates.

Traditionally, Siegert-state theory has focused on scattering resonances and decaying

states. See Refs.

[3, 4, 5, 6] for an overview of the literature. Several methods exist that

allow one to directly calculate the complex energy of a decaying state: complex scaling

[7, 8, 9], complex absorbing potentials [10, 11], and the direct solution of the Schr¨odinger

equation subject to the Siegert boundary condition, Eq. (2). This third approach used to

be numerically ineﬃcient, because a nonlinear eigenvalue problem had to be solved in an

iterative fashion [12, 13, 14].

A major step forward was made by Tolstikhin, Ostrovsky, and Nakamura [5, 6]. Their

method provides, after solving a single generalized eigenvalue problem, access not only to

the bound, antibound, and resonance states, but also to the discretized pseudocontinuum.

functions.

In addition, it becomes possible to derive fundamental properties of Siegert pseudostates

using simple and elegant mathematical techniques. An application of the method of Refs.

[5, 6] to a molecular fragmentation problem is the subject of Ref. [15]. In that work, only

bound states and outgoing Siegert pseudostates were utilized as fragmentation-channel basis

A point of central concern in this paper is the time evolution of a wave packet expanded

in terms of Siegert pseudostates. This aspect was ﬁrst addressed by Yoshida et al.

[16].

They successfully introduced Siegert pseudostates as a basis capable of eliminating artiﬁcial

boundary reﬂections. In a subsequent paper [17], it is argued that the time evolution for

t > 0 is given by

where the imaginary part of the complex energy En is negative. ϕn(r) is the spatial repre-

sentation of the nth Siegert pseudostate, and

In Sec. II, we review some ideas of the formalism of Tolstikhin, Ostrovsky, and Nakamura.

We extend their work by providing arguments why certain subsets of Siegert pseudostates

may be employed as bases. Moreover, we investigate time evolution in the context of Siegert

pseudostates. We ﬁnd that rigorous Siegert-pseudostate theory, in general, necessitates

nonexponential time evolution, in contradiction to Eq. (4). Numerical evidence is presented

in Sec. III. The calculations demonstrate that for a fast-moving wave packet Eq. (4) is

accurate, while its performance deteriorates as the average energy of the wave packet is

decreased. Section IV concludes. Atomic units are used throughout.

II. MATHEMATICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Consider the radial Schr¨odinger equation

where

given by

≥

V (r) is an arbitrary (short-range) potential. We seek solutions ϕ(r) for r

[0, a] (a > 0),

∈

such that at r = 0 the usual boundary condition for the radial eigenvalue problem

and at r = a the Siegert boundary condition, Eq. (2), are satisﬁed. The solutions ϕ(r) are

referred to as Siegert pseudostates [5, 6]. Equation (2) allows us to separate solutions to the

Schr¨odinger equation into purely outgoing, purely incoming, bound, and antibound states.

The wave number k in Eq. (2) is in general complex. Its relation to the eigenenergy E is

which implies that a should be chosen suﬃciently large, if possible, such that V (r) = const.

for r

a. Applying Eq. (9) in the case of a long-range potential introduces the approxima-

tion of forcing the potential to be constant beyond r = a, while preserving continuity of the

potential at that point—in contrast to the approach taken in Ref. [5, 6], which enforces a

discontinuity by setting V (a) = 0 in Eq. (9).

We refer to the eigenvector c in this equation as Siegert pseudovector. In practical calcula-
tions, the basis functions yj(r) may be chosen to be real. Thus, the matrices ˜H, S, and L
may be assumed to be symmetric and elements of RN ×N . Note, however, that the vector c,

consisting of the expansion coeﬃcients cj, j = 1, . . . , N [see Eq. (10)], is complex in general:

mind, the matrix

can be introduced in a meaningful way. While B is invertible [Eq. (27)], it is in general
neither positive- nor negative-deﬁnite. Hence, some of the columns of ˜U are real, but the
others are purely imaginary. The matrix ˜U can be utilized to convert the real symmetric,

indeﬁnite generalized eigenvalue problem, Eq. (26), to a standard one:

The matrix ˜A is complex symmetric. Unfortunately, complex symmetry is not a very

useful property, as it is known that any complex matrix of square format is similar to a

complex symmetric matrix (see, for instance, Ref.

[10]). Generally, it is not possible to

guarantee diagonalizability, i.e. the existence of a basis of eigenvectors, of a complex sym-
metric matrix. Note that ˜A consists of purely real and purely imaginary matrix blocks, but

whether this helps to prove its diagonalizability is currently unclear. A suﬃcient condition
for diagonalizability is that all 2N eigenvalues κn are distinct. Degeneracies could cause

diﬃculties, but in numerical calculations true (accidental) degeneracies are practically never
encountered. Under the assumption that ˜A is diagonalizable, ˜N = 2N and the matrix

complementary number of bound eigenvectors. (We provide in Sec. III numerical evidence
that these form indeed a basis of CN .) Consider an initial wave packet ψ(r; t = 0) that is

entirely localized within the interval [0, a]. Using Eqs. (10) and (51), and assuming pure

exponential time evolution for each Siegert pseudostate, the time evolution of the wave

packet for t > 0 is obtained from

the assumption of exponential time evolution is wrong in general for Siegert pseudostates.

A practically and formally more acceptable expression for the time evolution of the wave

packet can be derived from the Mittag-Leﬄer partial fraction decomposition [18] of the

Eq. (9) and replace the integration path in the energy plane by the integration contour in

the complex k plane illustrated in Fig. 2a. For t < 0, this contour can be closed in the ﬁrst

quadrant of the k plane without aﬀecting βn(t). The resulting integration loop is indicated in

Fig. 2b. The integration path along the positive imaginary axis is inﬁnitesimally displaced

toward positive real k values, so that the integrand in Eq. (63) is analytic on and inside the

loop. Hence, βn(t) = 0 for t < 0, as expected for a description based on the outgoing-wave

Green’s function.

If t > 0, then βn(t) can be written as the sum of two separate contour integrals. The

respective contours are shown in Fig. 2c. Thus we have

a wave packet. It is interesting to observe that in the limit t

0+, all βn(t) tend to 1/2,

→

for the Faddeeva function goes to unity in this limit. This ensures, in view of Eq. (40),

that limt→0+ ψ(r; t) = ψ(r; t = 0). Equations (62) and (69) also allow us to determine the

long-term behavior of the wave packet in the interval [0, a]. Using the asymptotic expansion

of the Faddeeva function [35] and Eq. (67), the wave packet for large t is seen to consist of

bound-state components evolving according to the exp

factor in Eq. (69) as well

iEnt
}

{−

as a decaying component that evolves in time as t−3/2. This speciﬁc power-law behavior of

a decaying state—in the long-time limit—is in fact well known [4, 19, 36, 37, 38] (see Refs.

[39, 40] for an alternative view).

III. NUMERICAL STUDIES

In this section, we apply the techniques developed so far to a wave packet in the model

potential of Eq. (1) [V0 = 5 and a = 10]. For the basis

yj(r) : j = 1, . . . , N

, a ﬁnite-element

{

}

basis set based on ﬁfth-order Hermite interpolating polynomials was used [27, 28, 29, 30,

31, 32, 33]. A mesh of evenly-spaced nodes was deﬁned radially, with three ﬁnite elements

centered at the ith node, ri. All three vanish in [0, ri−1] and [ri+1, a]. Their behavior at ri

separates them into three types. The zero-type polynomials have a ﬁnite function value at

the ith node, but zero ﬁrst and second derivatives. The one-type have a ﬁnite ﬁrst derivative,

but zero function value and zero second derivative. The two-type have a ﬁnite curvature,

but vanishing zero and ﬁrst derivatives. In order to enforce vanishing at the origin, Eq. (8),

only the one- and two-types are considered at the ﬁrst node (at r = 0). Thus, the dimension

14

of the ﬁnite-element basis set (N) is equal to one less than three times the number of nodes.

We numerically [34] solve the generalized eigenvalue problem of Eq. (20) to obtain 2N
Siegert pseudostates with 2N distinct eigenvalues κn. Appendix A proves that certain
subsets of N Siegert pseudostates achieve completeness in CN . However, which N states
CN ×N

must be selected is not clear. By looking at the eigenvalues of the matrix M

∈

[Eq. (44)], one can determine whether or not a selected subset of N vectors is complete. If

the vectors form a basis, the M matrix will have N (not necessarily distinct) eigenvalues

which diﬀer from zero. For the potential under consideration, the number of bound states

equals the number of antibound states. (In the Introduction, we mentioned that there are

10 physical bound and nine physical antibound states. The 10th antibound state found in

the numerical calculation cannot be converged and does not correspond to an eigenstate

of the Hamiltonian.) All combinations of bound or antibound with incoming or outgoing

Siegert pseudostates supply N distinct vectors, giving four plausible choices for a complete,

useful basis set. The eigenvalues of M were calculated for each case, and in so far as zero
was never one of them, all combinations proved to span CN . More speciﬁcally, more than

95 % of all eigenvalues of M equal unity to machine precision. The rest have a magnitude

ranging from 0.93 to 230.

To assess the ability of the Siegert pseudostates to represent a wave packet at t = 0, it

is ﬁrst necessary to investigate the limiting accuracy of the underlying ﬁnite-element basis

set. An initial wave packet is given the form of a Gaussian multiplied by a plane wave:

ψ(r; t = 0) = exp [

2ξ2 + ik0 (r
−

−

r0)] .

−

(r

r0)2

The Gaussian is centered in the middle of the well at r0 = 5, and ξ = 0.5 is chosen to ensure

that contribution outside the interval [0, a] is negligible.

We represent the wave packet as a superposition of the ﬁnite elements,

where the expansion coeﬃcients are chosen to minimize

using bound and outgoing Siegert pseudostates are tabulated, since these states provided

the qualitatively best results for time evolution based on Eq. (52). Other combinations of

N Siegert pseudostates will not be discussed further.

One observes in Table I that as the number of basis functions being used is increased,

χ2

in Table I demonstrate that similar statements hold with regard to accuracy if one utilizes

the overcomplete set of 2N Siegert pseudostates.

Now consideration is given to the propagation of a wave packet in time. To that end,

we require a benchmark of comparison. Positive-energy eigensolutions in the interval [0, a]

were found for the potential of study, Eq. (1), by matching at the discontinuity to energy-

normalized continuum solutions of the form

2
πk sin (kr + δ). These were used, together
with the bound-state solutions, to expand the Gaussian wave packet of Eq. (70). We refer

q

to this expansion as the “analytical solution,” even though it should be pointed out that

we carried out the integration over the energy continuum numerically. The validity of the

interval between 0 and 10, the potential is constant [V0 = 5 and a = 10 in Eq. (1)].

analytical solution was established by comparison with the closed-form expression in Eq.

(70) at t = 0. Numerical convergence of the energy integration was tested carefully and

ensured. Standard exponential time dependence was introduced for t > 0.

Once it is determined that the analytical solution gives a wave packet representation

that is exact to machine precision (at t = 0), we can compare wave packets represented

by Siegert pseudostates with conﬁdence that discrepancy is due to error on the part of the

Siegert pseudostates. We can do this using either Eq. (52) or Eq. (62) with Eq. (69) to

arrive at expansion coeﬃcients. For both forms we consider two cases: one where the initial

wave packet has an average energy suﬃcient to pass the potential step at r = a with little

reﬂection (k0 = 15), and one where k0 = 5, ensuring signiﬁcant physical reﬂection. The

wave packets in the two cases are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.

In order to gauge the accuracy of Eq. (52) [i.e., exponential time evolution using a basis

of N Siegert pseudostates], we modiﬁed χ2

k0 = 5, at all t > 0. This is because the assumption of pure exponential time evolution

in Eq. (52) is not justiﬁed. In fact, the more complicated time evolution suggested by Eq.

(69) provides superior agreement for both k0 = 15 and k0 = 5. It is important to notice

that the expansion coeﬃcients associated with all Siegert pseudostates evolve in time in a

nonexponential fashion. [Equation (52) fails also—for k0 = 5—if V0 is chosen to be so small

that there are no bound states in the well.] Nevertheless, at least when k0 = 15 (and bound

and outgoing Siegert pseudostates are selected), Eq. (52) is satisfactory. In this case, we

found numerically that the vector deﬁned by its elements cT

is, to machine precision, an eigenvector of the matrix M

approach of Refs.

[16, 17], based on Eq. (4), has been successful.

[For k0 = 5, we found

the performance of Eq. (4) to be even worse than that of Eq. (52).] The most general and

accurate treatment, however, is only accomplished on the basis of the time evolution derived

from the outgoing-wave Green’s function, Eqs. (62) and (69).

20

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we reviewed the numerical technique developed by Tolstikhin, Ostrovsky,

and Nakamura [5, 6] for calculating Siegert pseudostates. The approach is applicable to

general short-range potentials; it is not restricted to the simple model potential we made

use of in our numerical investigation. We incorporated a straightforward extension of the

method to nonorthogonal basis sets and explored in some detail the mathematical properties

of the Siegert pseudovectors, in particular questions of completeness.

Our main goal in this paper has been the development of a rigorous formulation of the

time evolution of a wave packet expanded in terms of Siegert pseudostates. Our study

demonstrates that assuming pure exponential time evolution can be a poor approximation.

The technique based on Eqs. (62) and (69), which implies nonexponential time evolution for

the entire set of 2N Siegert pseudostates, can reproduce very well the analytical reference

wave packet moving in the model potential. There are no artiﬁcial reﬂections at the boundary

of the grid (r = a). Physical reﬂections are correctly reproduced.

We have shown that it is possible to ﬁnd a subset consisting of N Siegert pseudovectors

that represents a basis of CN . Siegert pseudostates were used in Ref.

[15] to carry out

channel expansions in the context of multichannel quantum defect theory, using bound

and outgoing Siegert pseudostates only. This paper conﬁrms that such a choice provides

a complete basis, in principle. In the time domain, this means that a wave packet can be

represented for any t > 0 as a superposition of these N basis states. Their time evolution

is, however, nonexponential. The time-dependent expansion coeﬃcients may be found by

applying the completeness relation implied by Eq. (51) to the expansion in Eq. (62).

While wave-packet propagation using Eqs. (62) and (69) is numerically stable and ac-

curate, the calculation of all 2N eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue

problem in Eq. (20) is necessary in principle. This requirement poses a challenge for itera-

tive sparse-matrix techniques. Further developments will be needed in order to turn Siegert

pseudostates into a useful tool for large-scale calculations on atoms and molecules. Siegert

pseudostates have already oﬀered a glimpse at their extraordinary potential.

be eliminated. (Nevertheless, there is no reason to anticipate this to cause any diﬃculties

in numerical calculations.) If really necessary, then the vector c∗

NC−m must be kept as an
essential basis vector, and the construction procedure outlined above may be continued for

the remaining vectors c1, . . . , c2N −m−1.

Not only the vectors c∗

n [Re(kn) < 0] can be eliminated (except for the possible—though

unlikely—occurrence of essential vectors), but equations analogous to Eqs. (A3) and (A4)

exist also for the bound and the antibound eigenvectors. Note that for these, cT

mScm diﬀers
from 0. It is therefore clear that N linearly independent basis vectors cn, n = 1, . . . , N,

can be found among the vectors c1, . . . , c2N . The completeness relation satisﬁed by these N

vectors is given by Eq. (51).

APPENDIX B: TIME EVOLUTION AND THE FADDEEVA FUNCTION

For evaluating the integral in Eq. (66), it is useful to perform the substitution

The right-hand side of this equation is reminiscent of the Faddeeva function deﬁned in Eq.

p

(68). However, the integration path must be rotated back to the real axis. In order to do

this, we must carefully distinguish between poles due to bound, antibound, outgoing, or

incoming Siegert pseudostates. The pole of the integrand on the right-hand side of Eq. (B2)

lies in the upper s plane if, for t > 0 (

t/2 > 0),

Let us ﬁrst consider a bound state. In this case, the pole is in the second quadrant of

the complex s plane. The integration path, illustrated in Fig. 5a together with the location

of the bound-state pole, runs along the diagonal from the third to the ﬁrst quadrant. Since

the contour may be closed as indicated in the ﬁgure, and since there are no poles inside the

resulting loop, we ﬁnd

FIG. 5: The integration contour used to evaluate Eq. (B2) depends on the nature of the Siegert

The location of the pole in the case of an outgoing Siegert pseudostate is shown in Fig.

The pole’s location for an antibound and an incoming Siegert pseudostate, respectively,

can be seen in Figs. 5c and 5d. (The integration path now runs along the diagonal from

the ﬁrst to the third quadrant.) In neither case does the pole interfere with the rotation

of the integration path to the real s axis. Therefore, for an antibound or incoming Siegert

pseudostate the result reads

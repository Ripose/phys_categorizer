Quadrupole moments and hyperﬁne constants of metastable states of Ca+, Sr+, Ba+,
Yb+, Hg+, and Au∗

Atomic quadrupole moments and hyperﬁne constants of the metastable 2D3/2,5/2 states of Ca+,
Sr+, Ba+, Yb+, and Hg+ are calculated by the multiconﬁguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF)
and relativistic conﬁguration-interaction (RCI) methods. For Hg+, the conﬁguration is 5d96s2. For
the other ions, the conﬁguration consists of a single d-electron outside a set of closed shells. Current
interest in the quadrupole moments of these states is due to the fact that optical transitions of these
ions may be useful as references for frequency standards. Energy shifts of the metastable states due
to the interactions of the quadrupole moments with external electric ﬁeld gradients are among the
largest sources of error in these frequency standards. For the quadrupole moments, agreement is
obtained to within about 10 % with the available measurements. For the hyperﬁne constants, good
agreement is obtained with measurements and with other calculations, except for the A factors of
the 2D5/2 states of Sr+, Ba+, and Yb+, where the correlation eﬀects are so large that they reverse
the sign of the constant relative to the Dirac-Hartree-Fock value. As a test of the Hg+ calculational
methods, quadrupole moments and hyperﬁne constants are calculated for the 5d96s2 2D3/2,5/2 states
in isoelectronic neutral Au. This yields a new value of the nuclear quadrupole moment Q(197Au) =
+0.587(29) b.

In comparison with other atomic properties, such
as oscillator strengths or hyperﬁne constants, atomic
quadrupole moments have received little theoretical at-
tention, due in part to the lack of experimental data.
Only a few atomic quadrupole moments have been mea-
sured, and most of the theoretical work appears to have
been focussed on these cases.

The quadrupole moments of the 3p 2P3/2 state of Al,
the 5p 2P3/2 state of In, and the metastable np5(n +
1)s 3P2 states of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe (n = 2, 3, 4, and 5,
respectively) were measured by atomic beam radio fre-
quency spectroscopy [1, 2]. In these experiments, energy

level shifts were observed upon application of an exter-
nal electric ﬁeld gradient. The quadrupole moments of
the 4 3P and 5 3P excited states of He were determined
indirectly from measurements of the anisotropy of the
diamagnetic susceptibility [3, 4]. Since the quadrupole
moment of the ionic core inﬂuences the ﬁne-structure
of nonpenetrating Rydberg states, it is possible to ex-
tract the quadrupole moment of the ion from an anal-
ysis of the Rydberg spectrum of the neutral atom [5].
The quadrupole moments of several atomic ions, includ-
ing C+ [5, 6], Ne+ [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and N+ [5, 10], have
been determined in this way.

Current interest in the quadrupole moments of the
metastable states of certain atomic ions stems from the
application of narrow optical transitions to frequency
standards [11]. For several ions that might be used for
including Ca+, Sr+, Ba+, Yb+,
frequency standards,
and Hg+, the energy shifts due to the interaction of
the quadrupole moments of the metastable states with
stray electric ﬁeld gradients, due for example to stray
electric charges on ion trap electrodes, are among the
largest sources of systematic error. This problem was
ﬁrst pointed out by Dehmelt [12]. In practice, it does not
aﬀect neutral-atom optical frequency standards to the
same extent because of the absence of nearby charged ob-
jects. Recently, the quadrupole moments of the 4d 2D5/2
state of Sr+ [13], the 5d 2D3/2 state of Yb+ [14], and the
5d96s2 2D5/2 state of Hg+ [15] were determined by ob-
serving the changes in the optical transition frequencies
as static electric ﬁeld gradients were applied.

In a ﬁrst approximation, the metastable nd 2D3/2,5/2
states of Ca+, Sr+, Ba+, and Yb+ (n = 3, 4, 5, and 5,
respectively) are described by a single conﬁguration in-
volving one d-electron outside a set of ﬁlled shells or, in

the case of Hg+ and isoelectronic Au, a single d-vacancy
in a set of otherwise ﬁlled shells.
In this approxima-
tion, the quadrupole moment is due entirely to the sin-
gle d-electron or d-vacancy. A single-conﬁguration es-
timate of the quadrupole moment of the 5d96s2 2D5/2
state of Hg+ was published in Ref. [16]. However, elec-
tron correlation eﬀects can in some cases lead to large
corrections to the single-conﬁguration estimates for the
quadrupole moments. For example, the metastable 3P2
states of the rare gases Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe are known to
have quadrupole moments that deviate strongly from the
single-conﬁguration values [2]. For Kr and Xe, even the
signs of the quadrupole moments diﬀer from the single-
conﬁguration predictions.

Sternheimer obtained good agreement with experiment
for the rare gas quadrupole moments with a perturbative
model in which the outer (n + 1)s orbital is polarized by
the np vacancy [17, 18]. Although Sternheimer’s results
were in good agreement with experiment, Sundholm and
Olsen regarded this agreement as fortuitous, particularly
for Xe [19]. For Xe, they showed that the DT Q elec-
tron correlation contribution (due to double, triple, and
quadruple excitations from the 5p and 6s shells), rela-
tivistic corrections, and excitations to virtual f and g
orbitals all make contributions to the quadrupole mo-
ment of about the same magnitude as the total moment.
None of these eﬀects are included in Sternheimer’s treat-
ment. Sundholm and Olsen applied the multiconﬁgu-
ration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method to calculate the
quadrupole moments of the rare gas metastable atoms
and some other atoms, including Al, In, Be, Ca, C+, Ne+,
and Ar+ [19, 20, 21, 22]. Agreement with experiment is
good for the cases that have been measured. Recently,
Sur et al. have calculated the quadrupole moment of the
4d 2D5/2 state of Sr+ by the relativistic coupled-cluster
method [23].

In this work, I apply the multiconﬁguration Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method, i.e., the relativistic gen-
eralization of the MCHF method.
In the ﬁnal stages
of the calculations, relativistic conﬁguration-interaction
(RCI) calculations are carried out, using the orbitals de-
termined by MCDHF. This method of computing the
atomic wave function is similar to that used by Biero´n
and coworkers to calculate atomic hyperﬁne constants
[24]. MCDHF appears not to have been applied previ-
ously to the calculation of atomic quadrupole moments.
It has the advantage of taking relativity into account from
the start, rather than as a correction applied at the end of
the calculation, as is done with the MCHF method [19].
This is especially important for heavy atoms such as Yb+
and Hg+. Some preliminary results have been published
[15]. In addition, the magnetic dipole (A) and electric
quadrupole (B) hyperﬁne constants are calculated and
compared with experiment, as an indication of the qual-
ity of the wave functions. The calculation for Hg+ was
more complex than for the other ions, because of the
presence of the open d-shell. Also, there are few measure-
ments of the hyperﬁne constants of the 5d96s2 2D3/2,5/2

2

states. For this reason, equivalent calculations were made
for Au, which is isoelectronic to Hg+, and for which the A
and B hyperﬁne constants have been measured for both
ﬁne-structure states [25, 26].

II. METHODS

A. Single-conﬁguration estimates of the
quadrupole moment

In a single-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (HF) or Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (DHF) approximation, Θ (γ, J) depends
only on the mean values of r2 for the electrons which
are not in closed shells. For a conﬁguration consisting of
a single nd-electron outside a set of ﬁlled shells, the elec-
tric quadrupole moments for the J = 3/2 and J = 5/2
states are

Θ (nd, 3/2) =

Θ (nd, 5/2) =

e
hnd3/2|r2|nd3/2i,
5
2e
7

hnd5/2|r2|nd5/2i.

(2a)

(2b)

For a nd9n′s2 conﬁguration as in Hg+, Eqs.(2a)–
(2b) hold with a change of sign, because the electric
quadrupole moment is due to a single vacancy in an oth-
erwise ﬁlled shell rather than to a single electron. In the
nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock approximation, hndj |r2|ndji
does not depend on j. Several estimates of Θ (γ, J) based
on Eqs. (2a) and (2b) have appeared in the literature
[13, 16, 27, 28]. The radial matrix elements were esti-
mated from Cowan’s Hartree-Fock program [29] or from
simple Coulombic wave functions.

B. Multiconﬁguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method

One method of obtaining an approximation to the rel-
ativistic atomic wave function is the MCDHF method
[30]. In the MCDHF method an atomic state function
|Γ P JMJ i of parity P , electronic angular momentum J,
and z-component of electronic angular momentum MJ is
taken to be a linear combination of relativistic conﬁgu-
rational state functions (CSFs) |γkP JMJi:

|Γ P JMJ i =

ck|γkP JMJi,

(3)

Xk
where each CSF is a linear combination of antisym-
metrized product wave functions (Slater determinants)
such that the CSF has deﬁnite values of P , J, and MJ .
The CSFs diﬀer from one another by the orbitals (single-
electron radial functions) that are occupied and in the
ways in which the angular momenta of the electrons are
coupled together.

In a MCDHF calculation, the atomic Hamiltonian is
usually taken to be the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian,
which includes the kinetic energy of each electron and the

Coulomb interactions of each electron with the nucleus
and with the other electrons. Additional terms, such as
the Breit interaction, may be included but increase the
diﬃculty of the calculation. Solving the MCDHF equa-
tions then determines an approximate eigenfunction of
the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian having the form of Eq.
(3) by optimizing both the orbitals and the coeﬃcients
ck.

Once a set of orbitals has been determined by MCDHF
using a limited set of CSFs, the atomic state function can
be improved by a RCI calculation, in which the Dirac-
Coulomb Hamiltonian matrix (with or without the Breit
interaction) is diagonalized in a basis consisting of an ex-
panded set of CSFs. The new CSFs are generated from
the orbitals calculated in the previous steps. The result
of an RCI calculation is an atomic state function hav-
ing the form of Eq.
(3), but only the coeﬃcients and
not the orbitals are optimized. Given an approximate
atomic state function, obtained by either by MCDHF or
by RCI, the atomic quadrupole moment can be calcu-
lated by evaluating Eq. (1).

C. Calculational details

In the present work, the MCDHF and RCI calculations
were carried out with versions of the GRASP (General-
Purpose Relativistic Atomic Structure Program) code
[31, 32, 33]. Modules from the GRASP92 version, doc-
umented in Ref. [33], and the GRASPVU version, avail-
able from a website [34] were used.

Successively improved approximations to the atomic
state functions were made in three stages. First, the or-
bitals belonging to the shells that are occupied in the
lowest-order approximation were calculated by minimiz-
ing an energy functional that weighted the 2D3/2 and
2D5/2 states by their statistical (2J + 1) weights. This is
called an extended-optimal-level (EOL) calculation [32].
For example, in the calculation for the Ca+ 3d 2D3/2 and
3d 2D5/2 states, the 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals
were optimized. (Here, 2p refers to both the 2p1/2 and
2p3/2 orbitals, etc.) Orbitals belonging to the same angu-
lar momentum were required to be orthogonal. A Fermi
model was used for the nuclear charge distribution. The
Breit interaction, QED eﬀects, and ﬁnite nuclear mass
eﬀects were ignored throughout the calculation.

In the second stage of the calculation, several layers
of virtual orbitals were successively optimized in a series
of MCDHF-EOL calculations. Each layer consisted of
a set of orbitals having diﬀerent angular momenta. All
previously calculated orbitals were kept ﬁxed, and only
the new orbitals were optimized. Diﬀerent orbitals of the
same angular momentum were required to be orthogonal.
A limited set of CSFs was considered. CSFs generated by
allowing excitations of valence electrons, with or without
single excitations of certain core shells, were included.

In the ﬁnal stage of the calculation, the set of CSFs
was systematically increased by allowing single excita-

3

tions from lower-lying core shells with or without va-
lence excitations (core-valence correlation) and double
or triple excitations from some of the higher-lying core
shells (core-core correlation) to unoccupied shells. RCI
calculations were then carried out in the expanded basis
of CSFs, using the orbitals determined in the previous
stage. A practical limit to the number of CSFs in a single
RCI calculation was somewhat above 45 000 for a single
J-value. The general method is similar to that used by
Biero´n et al.
for the calculation of hyperﬁne constants
of neutral mercury [24]. At each step of the calculation,
the hyperﬁne constants and atomic quadrupole moments
were calculated. The program HFS92 [35] was used to
calculate the A and B hyperﬁne constants.

some cases, core-valence contributions to the quadrupole
moment and to the hyperﬁne constants from diﬀerent
core shells were calculated in separate RCI calculations
and then combined, making use of the fact that such
contributions are approximately additive.

Just before this manuscript was submitted for publica-
tion, the author learned of an error in the GRASP codes,
speciﬁcally in the library function tnsrjj.f [36]. The calcu-
lations were repeated with the corrected codes. In some
cases, the values of the atomic quadrupole moments and
the B factors calculated with the corrected codes diﬀer
by as much as few percent from those calculated with the
uncorrected codes. The values of the A factors are not
aﬀected to the same extent.

D. Nuclear models and moments

For each of the atoms studied, Ca+, Sr+, Ba+, Yb+,
Hg+, and Au, a particular isotope was chosen to deﬁne
the nuclear charge distribution ρ(r) used for the Dirac-
Coulomb Hamiltonian used for the MCDHF and RCI cal-
culations. A Fermi distribution of the form

ρ(r) =

ρ0
1 + e(r−c)/a

(4)

is assumed, with ﬁtted values for the a and c parameters
[37]. The isotopes chosen for the calculations were 43Ca,
87Sr, 137Ba, 171Yb, 199Hg, and 197Au. The 171Yb and
199Hg isotopes were chosen because they are currently
used in atomic frequency standards, but since they both
have nuclear spin I = 1/2, they provide no information
about the electric quadrupole hyperﬁne structure. For
that reason, the hyperﬁne constants were also calculated
for 173Yb+ (I = 5/2) and for 201Hg+ (I = 3/2). The
atomic wavefunctions calculated for 171Yb+ and 199Hg+
were used.

The nuclear magnetic moments are suﬃciently well
known that their uncertainties are likely to be much less
than the errors in the atomic calculations for A. The val-
ues of the nuclear magnetic moments were taken from the
tables of Raghavan [38]. However, nuclear quadrupole

moments (Q) are less well known, since they are not
measured directly. Nuclear quadrupole moments derived
from interaction constants in atoms, molecules, or solids
depend on diﬃcult calculations of the electric ﬁeld gra-
dients at the nucleus. Values derived from muonic x-
ray spectra are subject to other systematic errors. For
example, some muonic determinations of the nuclear
quadrupole moment of 201Hg diﬀer from each other by
more than their combined uncertainties [24]. The Q val-
ues used in these calculations are given in Table I. Most
of the values were taken from the compilation of Pyykk¨o
[39]. It is a simple matter to rescale the B constants if
better Q values become available.

III. RESULTS

A. Ca+

The results of the calculation for 43Ca+ are given
in Table II. DHF refers to a Dirac-Hartree-Fock EOL
calculation. Five layers of virtual orbitals were opti-
mized in a series of MCDHF-EOL calculations. All
CSFs having the proper parity and total angular mo-
mentum that could be constructed by allowing sin-
gle and double excitations from the valence 3d and
the {2s, 2p, 3s, 3p} core shells, with at most one core
excitation, were included.
The orbitals in Layers
1 to 5 were {4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5g, 6h}, {5s, 5p, 5d, 5f, 6g},
{6s, 6p, 6d, 6f }, {7s, 7p, 7d}, and {8s, 8p, 8d}, respec-
tively. A limited amount of core-core (c-c) correlation
was then included by considering the CSFs obtained by
allowing double excitations from the {3s, 3p} core shells
to Layer 1 (Step 7) and to Layers 1 and 2 (Step 8). This
set of CSFs was added to the set used in the Step 7
MCDF calculation. The atomic state functions were then
optimized in RCI calculations. It is of interest to note
that the ﬁnal values of the quadrupole moments and the
hyperﬁne constants are not too diﬀerent from the DHF
values, except for A5/2, which is smaller in magnitude by
a factor of 3.4.

Table III compares the results of the ﬁnal RCI calcu-
lation with experiment and with other calculations. The
agreement of the calculated value for A3/2 with both ex-
periment and with other recent calculations is excellent.

4

For A5/2, where the corrections to the DHF value are very
large, the calculated value disagrees with experiment by
about two experimental standard deviations. The calcu-
lated B3/2 and B5/2 factors are in agreement with ex-
periment, but the experimental uncertainties are large.
They agree well with other calculations.

B. Sr+

The results of the calculation for 87Sr+ are given in Ta-
ble IV. Similarly to the calculation for Ca+, ﬁve layers
of virtual orbitals were optimized in a series of MCDHF-
EOL calculations. Single and double excitations from the
valence 4d and the {3d, 4s, 4p} core shells, with at most
one core excitation, were included. The orbitals in Lay-
ers 1 to 5 were {5s, 5p, 5d, 4f, 5g, 6h}, {6s, 6p, 6d, 5f, 6g},
{7s, 7p, 7d, 6f }, {8s, 8p, 8d}, and {9s, 9p, 9d}, respec-
tively. Step 7 is an RCI calculation including the CSFs of
Step 6 and also those involving single excitations from the
{3s, 3p} shells. This adds core-valence correlation not al-
ready included in the MCDHF calculations. Other RCI
calculations including core-core correlation were made,
allowing double excitations from the {3d, 4s, 4p} shells
to Layer 1 (Step 8) and allowing double excitations from
the {4s, 4p} shells to Layers 1 and 2 (Step 9), in addition
to the Step 6 CSFs. Step 10 is an RCI calculation with
a set of CSFs that is the union of the sets used for Steps
8 and 9. Step 11 uses the union of the sets of CSFs used
for Steps 7 and 10.

Table V compares the ﬁnal results with experiment
and with other calculations. There are no experimental
results for the 4d 2D3/2 state. The present results are
generally in good agreement with other calculations and
with the available experimental data, with the exception
of A5/2.
It appears that the correlation correction to
A5/2 is so large as to change its sign relative to the DHF
value. The diﬀerence between the present calculation and
the experimental value is -4.94 MHz, which is 30 % of the
total correlation correction, obtained by taking the dif-
ference of the the DHF value and the experimental value.
The fact that three calculations yield a value for B5/2 of
approximately 56 MHz, while the experimental value is
49.11(6) MHz, suggests that the 87Sr nuclear quadrupole
might be approximately 0.29 b, rather than 0.335(20)
b as listed in Table I. The value in Table I is based on
the measured B factor of the 5s5p 3P2 state of 87Sr, com-
bined with a semiempirical calculation of the electric ﬁeld
gradient based on the measured magnetic dipole hyper-
ﬁne interaction constants [40]. A calculated Sternheimer
antishielding correction [41] was applied. Some other re-
cent determinations of Q for 87Sr, based on the measured
B factor of the 5p 2P3/2 state of 87Sr+ combined with
ab initio calculations of the electric ﬁeld gradient, are
0.327(24) b [42] and 0.323(20) b [43]. The present cal-
culation of Θ5/2 agrees to within 4 % with a recent rela-
tivistic coupled-cluster calculation. The measured value
of Θ5/2 disagrees with the present calculation by about

10 and 11. Step 13 is an RCI calculation that uses the
union of the sets of CSFs used for Steps 7, 10, and 11. In
Step 14, the {3s, 3p, 3d} core-valence contribution (taken
as the diﬀerence between the results of Step 8 and Step
7) is added to the results of Step 13. It was not feasible
to include all of the CSFs of Step 13 and Step 8 in a
single RCI calculation.

Table VII compares the ﬁnal results with experiment
and with other calculations. The present results are gen-
erally in good agreement with other calculations and with
the available experimental data, with the exception of
A5/2. As with 87Sr+, the correlation correction to A5/2
is so large as to change its sign relative to the DHF value.
The diﬀerence between the present calculation and the
experimental value is 21.4 MHz, which is 31 % of the
total correlation correction.

C. Ba+

D. Yb+

The results of the calculation for 137Ba+ are given
in Table VI. Five layers of virtual orbitals were op-
timized in a series of MCDHF-EOL calculations. Sin-
gle and double excitations from the valence 5d and
the {4d, 5s, 5p} core shells, with at most one core
excitation, were included.
The orbitals in Layers
1 to 5 were {6s, 6p, 6d, 4f, 5g, 6h}, {7s, 7p, 7d, 5f, 6g},
{8s, 8p, 8d, 6f }, {9s, 9p, 9d}, and {10s, 10p, 10d}, respec-
tively. Step 7 is an RCI calculation including the CSFs of
Step 6 and also those involving single excitations from the
{4s, 4p} shells (additional core-valence correlation).
In
Step 8, core-valence correlation involving the {3s, 3p, 3d}
shells is added in an RCI calculation. Other RCI calcu-
lations including core-core correlation were made, allow-
ing double excitations from the {5s, 5p} shells to Layer 1
(Step 9) and to Layers 1 and 2 (Step 10), in addition to
the Step 6 CSFs. In Step 11, double excitations from the
{4d, 5s, 5p} shells to Layer 1 were allowed, in addition to
the Step 6 CSFs. Step 12 is an RCI calculation with a
set of CSFs that is the union of the sets used for Steps

The results of the calculations for 171Yb+ and 173Yb+
are given in Table VIII. The electronic structures of
the lowest-energy states of Yb+ diﬀer from those of
Ba+ in having fully ﬁlled 4f shells.
Since the 4f
electrons are easily excited, correlation eﬀects are ex-
pected to be large.
Five layers of virtual orbitals
were optimized in a series of MCDHF-EOL calcula-
tions. Single and double excitations from the valence
5d and the {4f, 5s, 5p} core shells, with at most one
core excitation, were included. The orbitals in Lay-
ers 1 to 5 were {6s, 6p, 6d, 5f, 5g, 6h}, {7s, 7p, 7d, 6f, 6g},

tively. Step 7 is an RCI calculation including the CSFs
of Step 6 and also those involving single excitations from

involving the {3s, 3p, 3d} shells is added in an RCI cal-
culation. Step 9 is an RCI calculation allowing double

double excitations from the {4f, 5s, 5p} shells to Layer

perimental results for 173Yb+ nor any comparable cal-
culations for either isotope. An experimental value for
of A3/2 of 171Yb+ has been published, but without an
estimate of the uncertainty [44]. The uncertainty listed
in Table IX is based on a private communication [45].
The calculated and measured values agree to within this
uncertainty. The sign of the calculated value of A5/2 for
171Yb+ is correct (unlike the cases for Sr+ and Ba+), but
its magnitude diﬀers from the calculated value by about
a factor of 5. The diﬀerence between the present cal-
culation and the experimental value is 51.1 MHz, which
is 28 % of the total correlation correction. The present
calculation of Θ3/2 agrees with the experimental value to
within the experimental uncertainty of 5 %.

E. Hg+

The results of the calculations for 199Hg+ and 201Hg+
5d96s2 2D3/2,5/2 states are given in Table X. Hg+ diﬀers

from the other ions considered here in having a more com-
plex electronic conﬁguration. This necessitated carefully
limiting the CSF expansions to keep the total number of
CSFs per J state below about 45 000. Four layers of vir-
tual orbitals were optimized in a series of MCDHF-EOL
calculations. Single and double excitations from the va-
lence 6s and the {5s, 5p, 5d} core shells, with at most
one core excitation, were included. The orbitals in Lay-
ers 1 to 4 were {7s, 6p, 6d, 5f, 5g, 6h}, {8s, 7p, 7d, 6f, 6g},
{9s, 8p, 8d}, and {10s, 9p}, respectively. The change in
the A and B factors upon adding Layer 4 was on the
order of 1 %. The change in the quadrupole moments
was less than 0.2 %.
In order to limit the numbers of
CSFs, the orbitals of Layer 4 were not used in the RCI
calculations.

Steps 6–10 are RCI calculations including the CSFs of
Step 4 and also those involving single excitations from
each of the 4f , 4d, 4p, 4s, and 3d core shells individ-
ually (additional core-valence correlation). The core-
valence contributions to the hyperﬁne constants are on
the order of 1–2 % per shell for the n = 4 shells, but
less for the 3d shell. The corresponding contributions
to the quadrupole moments are small, less than 0.2 %
per shell. Step 11 is an RCI calculation allowing dou-
ble (d) excitations from the {5d, 6s} shells to Layer 1′
({7s, 6p, 6d, 5f }), in addition to the Step 4 CSFs. In Step
12, double and triple (dt) excitations from the {5d, 6s}
shells to Layer 1′ were allowed, in addition to the Step
4 CSFs. Signiﬁcant changes in both the hyperﬁne con-
stants and the quadrupole moments were noted in both
Step 11 and Step 12. Step 13 is an RCI calculation with
a set of CSFs that is the union of the set used for Step 12
and the set obtained by allowing double excitations from
the {5s, 5p, 5d} shells to Layer 1′. In Step 14, the core-
valence contributions from the {3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f } shells
calculated in separate RCI calculations (Steps 6–10) are
added to the results of Step 13.

The validity of adding core-valence contributions from
separate RCI calculations was veriﬁed by comparing the
results for pairs of core shells considered together and
separately. For example, the 4s core-valence RCI calcu-
lation (Step 9) changes A5/2 of 199Hg+ by +19.6 MHz
compared to the Step 4 MCDHF result. The 4p core-

valence RCI calculation (Step 8) changes it by +11.1
MHz. An RCI calculation in which the 4s and 4p core-
valence contributions were both included resulted in a
change of +31.1 MHz, compared to +30.7 MHz for the
sum of the 4s and 4p contributions calculated separately.
It was not feasible to include all of the core-valence con-
tributions in a single RCI calculation.

Table XI compares the ﬁnal results for 199Hg+ and
201Hg+ with experiment and with other calculations.
The present result for A3/2 of 199Hg+ agrees within 2.4 %
with the experimental result. No experimental values for
the B factors of 201Hg+ are available for comparison. Ob-
servations of the hyperﬁne structure by classical optical
spectroscopy [46, 47] are not precise enough for this pur-
pose. The calculations of Brage et al. [48] were carried
out by the MCDHF and RCI methods with a set of CSFs
more limited than that for the present calculation. The
experimental value for Θ5/2 is 26 % smaller in magnitude
than the DHF value, so the correlation contribution to
the quadrupole moment is greater than for the other ions
studied here. The present result for Θ5/2 disagrees with
the experimental value by about 10.5 %, which is about
3 times the experimental uncertainty. The disagreement
is about 30 % of the total correlation contribution.

calculated values of A3/2 and A5/2 agree with the ex-

of B3/2 and B5/2 diﬀer from experiment by about 8 %.
However, this comparison depends on the value assumed
for the nuclear quadrupole moment Q(197Au).

The current status of knowledge of Q(197Au) has been
summarized by Schwerdtfeger et al. [49]. The currently
accepted value listed by Pyykk¨o [39] is +0.547(16) b (1 b
= 10−28 m2) and is based on muonic hyperﬁne measure-
ments. A value of +0.594(10) b was derived by Blachman
et al. [26] based on the experimental B factors of the Au
5d96s2 2D3/2,5/2 states [25, 26], i.e., the same states stud-
ied in the present work. However, Blachman et al. did
not calculate the atomic electric ﬁeld gradients from ab
initio theory, as in the present work, but inferred them
from the experimental A factors. This method is of un-
certain accuracy and does not include the Sternheimer
antishielding correction, which is included in the present
calculation. Schwerdtfeger et al. [49] obtained Q(197Au)
= +0.60 b from measured M¨ossbauer electric quadrupole
splittings in a large number of gold compounds combined
with solid-state density-functional calculations. They
obtained Q(197Au) = +0.64 b from the measured elec-
tric quadrupole coupling constant in (CO)AuF (i.e., the
weakly bound complex of a CO molecule and a AuF
molecule), together with a relativistic coupled-cluster cal-
culation of the electronic structure of the complex.

Since the muonic and the other determinations of
Q(197Au) appear to be discrepant, it is of interest to
derive a value based on the present calculations. These
calculations imply values of Q(197Au) of +0.5918 b and
+0.5816 b, based on the experimental values of B3/2 and
B5/2, respectively. These values agree to within about
2 %. Assigning an uncertainty to the value of Q derived
in this way is diﬃcult. One way is to make use of the

fact that the relative calculational errors for the A and B
factors are similar, since they both depend to ﬁrst order
on matrix elements of 1/r3 for the 5d electrons. (This
method of estimating the relative errors would not hold
for cases where there are large cancelations, as for A5/2
in Ca+, Sr+, Ba+, and Yb+.) Based on the fact that the
calculated values of A3/2 and A5/2 for 197Au and A5/2 for
199Hg+ agree with the experimental values to within 3 %
or better, 5 % is a reasonable estimate for the error in
the estimate of Q. The new estimate, based on the aver-
age of the values derived from B3/2 and B5/2 of 197Au, is
Q(197Au) = +0.587(29) b. The error bars of the present
measurement overlap those of the muonic measurement.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The main object of this study was to calculate the
atomic quadrupole moments of the metastable 2D3/2,5/2
states of several ions and atoms to an uncertainty better
than those of the simple estimates obtained from Hartree-
Fock or Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations [e.g., Eqs.(2a)–
(2b)]. This is apparently the ﬁrst use of MCDHF and
RCI methods for this purpose. For Ca+, Ba+, and Au,
there are no experimental or other theoretical values for
comparison. For Θ5/2 of Sr+, the experimental determi-
nation has an uncertainty of 11.5 %, so it does not provide

a precise test of the calculation. However, a recent rel-
ativistic coupled-cluster calculation [23] agrees with the
present calculation to within 4 %. An experimental de-
termination of Θ3/2 of Yb+ agrees with the present cal-
culation to within the experimental uncertainty of 5 %.
The experimental determination of Θ5/2 for Hg+ diﬀers
from the present calculation by 10.5 %. In summary, the
method used in this work appears to be capable of cal-
culating the atomic quadrupole moments to about 5 %
or better for conﬁgurations consisting of a single nd elec-
tron outside a set of closed shells, while the error appears
to be about 10 % for the more complex 5d96s2 2D3/2,5/2
states.

The second object was to calculate the hyperﬁne con-
stants of the same states. For most of the cases where
there is experimental data, the agreement is within a few
percent. For the B factors, some of the discrepancies
may be due to errors in the nuclear quadrupole moments
used. The exception to the generally good agreement
5/2 states of Sr+, Ba+, and
is for the A factors of the D
Yb+, where the correlation contributions exceed 100 %
of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock values, leading to a change in
sign of the constants, relative to the DHF values. The
present calculations are in error by about 30 % of the
total correlation contribution. The source of the error
is not understood. It may be related to limitations on
the form of the CSFs included in the calculations or to
the particular strategy used for the optimization of the
orbitals. Apparently, many-body perturbation theory or
coupled-cluster theory can give better results for the A
factors of these states, although this has not yet been
demonstrated for Yb+.

The present methods give good results for the hyper-
ﬁne constants of the 5d96s2 2D3/2,5/2 states of Hg+ and
Au. The A factors agree with experiment to about 3 %.
The B factors calculated for Au disagree by about 8 %,
but this may be due to an error in the currently accepted
value of the nuclear quadrupole moment. The present
calculations are the the most accurate ab inito calcula-
tions for the hyperﬁne constants of these states. Appar-
ently, many-body perturbation theory or coupled-cluster
theory have not yet been applied to these systems.

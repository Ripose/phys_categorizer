(Dated: February 2, 2008)
With ultracold 87Sr conﬁned in a magic wavelength optical lattice, we present the most precise
study (2.8 Hz statistical uncertainty) to-date of the 1S0 - 3P0 optical clock transition with a detailed
analysis of systematic shifts (20 Hz uncertainty) in the absolute frequency measurement of 429 228
004 229 867 Hz. The high resolution permits an investigation of the optical lattice motional sideband
structure. The local oscillator for this optical atomic clock is a stable diode laser with its Hz-level
linewidth characterized across the optical spectrum using a femtosecond frequency comb.

In recent years, optical atomic clocks have become
increasingly competitive in performance with their mi-
crowave counterparts. The overall accuracy of single
trapped ion based optical standards closely approaches
that of the state-of-the-art cesium fountain standards
[1, 2]. Large ensembles of ultracold alkaline earth atoms
have provided impressive clock stability for short aver-
aging times, surpassing that of single-ion based systems.
So far, interrogation of neutral atom based optical stan-
dards has been carried out primarily in free space, un-
avoidably including atomic motional eﬀects that typically
limit the overall system accuracy [3, 4, 5]. An alternative
approach is to explore the ultranarrow optical transitions
of atoms held in an optical lattice [6, 7, 8]. The atoms
are tightly localized so that Doppler and photon-recoil
related eﬀects on the transition frequency are eliminated
[9]. Meanwhile, the trapping potential is created by laser
light at a carefully chosen wavelength (λmagic) such that
it has essentially no eﬀect on the internal clock transition
frequency. Additionally, the increased atom-probe laser
interaction time enabled by the lattice conﬁnement per-
mits a full utilization of the narrow natural linewidth.
This optical lattice approach using neutral atoms may
provide the best possible combination of clock stability
and accuracy. Such a proposal has been under intensive
investigation in the case of the doubly forbidden 1S0 -
3P0 transition in the fermionic Sr isotope, 87Sr [6, 10].
Similar work in Yb is also in progress [11, 12].

The ﬁrst high precision absolute frequency measure-
ment was recently reported for the 87Sr 1S0 - 3P0 clock
transition using a GPS-based frequency reference [6].
However, establishing a new standard demands that dif-
ferent groups study potential systematic errors. In this
Letter, we present the most precise study to-date of this
ultranarrow clock transition in a magic wavelength opti-
cal lattice, with a direct reference to the NIST F1 Cs
fountain clock. We have investigated systematic fre-
quency shifts including those originating from atomic
density, wavelength and intensity of the optical lattice,
residual magnetic ﬁeld, and probing laser intensity. We
determined the absolute frequency of the 87Sr clock tran-
sition to be 429, 228, 004, 229, 867 ± 20 (sys) ± 2.8 (stat)
Hz. Furthermore, we apply this optical clock resolution
towards a study of ultracold atomic motion in an anhar-

monic optical potential.

To exploit the long coherence time provided by the ul-
tranarrow (transition linewidth γ ≃ 1 mHz) 1S0 - 3P0
clock transition, we have developed a cavity stabilized
diode laser at 698 nm. The laser is locked to an iso-
lated, passive reference cavity with ﬁnesse of ∼250,000
and cavity linewidth of ∼20 kHz. This reference cav-
ity is mounted vertically and supported symmetrically
with respect to the cavity length, which minimizes the
length sensitivity to environmental vibrations [13]. The
entire system is relatively simple and compact, occupying
less than 1 m3. To characterize this laser, we compare
it to a highly stabilized Nd:YAG CW laser (in an ad-
jacent laboratory) which has consistently demonstrated
a sub-Hz linewidth. This comparison was made possi-
ble with a phase-stabilized femtosecond frequency comb.
The repetition rate (100 MHz) of the octave spanning,
self-referenced Ti:Sapphire fs comb was tightly locked
to the cavity stabilized 698 nm diode laser, coherently
transferring the diode laser stability to each of the ∼106
modes of the fs frequency comb. A heterodyne beat sig-
nal between the sub-Hz Nd:YAG reference laser and a
corresponding fs comb mode at 1064 nm, shown in Fig.
1, revealed a linewidth of less than 5 Hz for the 698 nm
diode laser and demonstrates optical coherence transfer
at the 10−14 level between remotely located lasers of dif-
ferent colors. Additionally, the ﬁnal stability of the 698
nm laser system was conﬁrmed to be limited by thermal-
mechanical noise of the mirror substrates in the Zerodur
reference cavity [14] and will be improved with new mir-
rors. The frequency drift caused by the material creep of
the cavity spacer was carefully compensated via measure-
ment of the optical frequency relative to a Cs fountain-
calibrated hydrogen maser using the same fs comb.

Preceding the 1S0 - 3P0 spectroscopy, 87Sr atoms un-
dergo two stages of laser cooling (using the 1S0 - 1P1 and
then the 1S0 - 3P1 transitions - see Fig. 2) to prepare ap-
proximately 106 atoms at µK temperatures [15, 16, 17].
Loading of atoms from the MOT to a 1-D optical lat-
tice operating at λmagic ≈ 813 nm allows simultaneous
cooling and trapping on the 1S0 - 3P1 transition so that
spatial mode matching between the MOT and lattice is
not critical. 10% of the atoms (≥ 105) are loaded from
the red MOT to the lattice, which has a lifetime of 1 s.

and the schematic of the optical layout delivering the probe
and lattice laser to the atoms. P: polarizer, DM: dichroic
mirror, PMT: photo-multiplier tube. The strong longitudinal
and weak transverse conﬁnement of the 1-D lattice creates
2-D trapping regions.

Inside the lattice, the axial trap oscillation frequency is
Ω = 2π × 80 kHz, corresponding to a Lamb-Dicke param-
eter of η = kpp~/(2mΩ) = 0.23. Here kp = 2π/λp, λp is
the probe wavelength, 2π~ is Planck’s constant, and m is
the atomic mass. In this regime, spectroscopy of the clock
transition can be performed nearly free of any Doppler or
photon recoil shifts. To avoid residual transverse Doppler
eﬀects (transverse oscillation frequency is 500 Hz), the
probing laser is carefully aligned to co-propagate with
the lattice laser (Fig. 2), with both lasers being focused
to a ∼70 µm beam diameter at the trap. The probing
laser is operated with optical powers near 5 nW. Spec-
troscopy typically consists of a probing time of 10-40 ms
followed by a 2 ms illumination of the atoms by 679 nm
light, which pumps the excited state 3P0 population to
the 3S1 state for shelving to the 3P2 state after sponta-
neous decay (Fig. 2). Because of spatial inhomogeneity
in the Rabi excitation frequency, we repeat the iteration
of probe and pump pulses approximately 20 times to en-
hance the signal size. Finally, we detect the ground state
1S0 population by resonantly exciting the strong 1S0 -
1P1 transition at 461 nm and counting ﬂuorescence.

The resolution of lattice spectroscopy enables us to in-
vestigate the motional states of atomic Sr along the lon-
gitudinal axis of the 1-D lattice. A deep lattice potential
(where the populated motional quantum states are well
below the energy barrier between adjacent sites) can be
well approximated by harmonic conﬁnement leading to
equally spaced motional states. These motional states al-
low inelastic excitations which are red and blue detuned
from the elastic, purely electronic 1S0 - 3P0 excitation,
with amplitudes suppressed by η2/4 in the Lamb-Dicke
regime. A measure of the amplitudes of the red and blue
sidebands directly gives the relative population of the
ground and ﬁrst excited motional state in 1S0 and thus
the atomic ensemble temperature [18, 19]. As shown in
Fig. 3(a), this measure yields an atomic temperature of
5 µK, in good agreement with time of ﬂight tempera-

ture measurements. Since the lattice trap depth is only
∼20 µK, the harmonic approximation deteriorates for ex-
cited motional states (n ≥ 1, where n is the motional
quantum number). One consequence of the anharmonic-
ity of the optical conﬁnement is the decreasing energy
spacing between diﬀerent motional states, spreading the
inelastic sidebands into the individual n → n + 1 tran-
sitions. This anharmonic spreading partly explains the
broad sidebands shown in Fig. 3(a). By knowing the trap
depth and the energy of the n=0 → n′=1 transition, we
solve for the exact eigenenergies of the cos2(kz) depen-
dent longitudinal lattice potential [20], where k is the lat-
tice wave vector. The resulting eigenenergies, in units of
lattice photon recoil energy, are shown in Fig. 3(b) as the
lattice band structure. Knowing the relative frequency of
each n → n+1 transition, we ﬁt the blue sideband of Fig.
3(a) with multiple Lorentzians to yield the amplitudes
(assumed to be Boltzmann-distributed) and the widths
of these transitions. The relative amplitudes among the
various n → n + 1 blue sidebands oﬀer a more accurate
measure of the atomic population of various longitudi-
nal motional states and hence the sample temperature.
This result, also 5 µK, is consistent with measurements
based on the relative blue and red sideband amplitudes.
The individual n → n + 1 transition linewidths are very
broad compared to the elastic n → n carrier transition.
Although some intrinsic broadening is introduced by the
band structure of the motional eigenstates (<1 Hz for
lower states, ∼kHz for upper states), major linewidth
contributions arise from externally induced dissipations
among motional states and radial variations of Ω. Pos-
sible external dissipation includes motional transitions
induced by lattice phase and intensity noise, two-body
atomic collisions, and the blackbody radiation. Unlike
typical ion trapping experiments where individual mo-
tional states are indistinguishable due to deep harmonic
trapping, the scenario described here permits detailed

studies of level-speciﬁc dissipation dynamics.

Spectroscopy of the 1S0 - 3P0 elastic carrier transition
of 87Sr in an optical lattice has the potential to yield one
of the highest optical resolutions ever measured [21]. Of
course, a number of potential relaxation mechanisms can
limit the achievable coherence time. A narrow spectrum
of the carrier transition is shown in Fig. 3(d). The ≤
200 Hz full width at half maximum linewidth allows for
relatively rapid averaging of multiple spectra to achieve
statistical uncertainties of the transition center frequency
below the 5 Hz level, typically limited by the hydrogen
maser stability used for frequency counting. Our eﬀorts
to reduce the broadening mechanisms were made in sev-
eral diﬀerent areas. To eliminate linewidth broadening of
the ﬁber-optic-transferred probe laser (∼100 Hz) caused
by ﬁber phase noise, we implemented ﬁber noise can-
cellation to sub-Hz precision [22]. Lack of perfect over-
lap between the probe and lattice lasers can introduce
Doppler broadening along the weakly conﬁned transverse
axes of the 1-D lattice. For this reason, we ensured that
the well overlapped lattice and probe lasers had strong
back coupling into both ﬁbers from the retroreﬂecting
lattice mirror. Additionally, the ﬁnite size of the probe
−→
kp which
beam creates a Heisenberg limited spread of

samples some of the transverse motion. This eﬀect is be-
low 50 Hz. In future work, these broadening mechanisms
will be circumvented by implementation of a 3-D opti-
cal lattice. State preparation of the atomic population
in ground state mF sublevels was not attempted, mak-
ing inhomogenous Zeeman broadening possible because
of the diﬀerential shift of ∼100 Hz/G × mF between 1S0
and 3P0 states due to the latter’s hyperﬁne mixing [23].
We used Helmholtz coil pairs to minimize residual mag-
netic ﬁelds. If not operated at λmagic, the lattice laser can
introduce large inhomogenous AC Stark broadening. By
varying the lattice power and wavelength around λmagic,
we ensured linewidth contributions were below 30 Hz.
Also, dissipation processes in the higher motional states
can cause broadening in the elastic n → n transition. By
sideband cooling the population to the ground motional
state, this eﬀect could be reduced [24]. To date, we have
not observed any eﬀect of atomic density in the lattice
on the measured linewidth.

Figure 4 summarizes the measurement of the 1S0 - 3P0
transition frequency within three months. Limited by a
statistical uncertainty of 2.8 Hz, we have performed a de-
tailed study of systematic shifts and their corresponding
uncertainties, which are listed in Table 1. The most basic
systematic error associated with spectroscopy in an op-
tical lattice is the AC Stark shift of the clock transition
due to the conﬁning optical potential. To experimentally
determine the magnitude and uncertainty of this shift,
we varied the lattice intensity around our typical operat-
ing intensity of I0 = 35 kW/cm2 at wavelengths below,
above, and near λmagic. At our typical operating wave-
length of 813.437 nm, Fig. 4(a) shows the frequency shift
as a function of intensity. The slope of this shift yields
an overall correction of 17(8.3) Hz at the typical lattice
intensity of I0. We have also experimentally determined
that for the lattice intensity of I0, the induced frequency
shift is ∼2 mHz for a lattice frequency deviation of 1
MHz from the magic wavelength. Combining this with
our measurement of the lattice AC stark shift of 17 Hz at
813.437 nm yields λmagic = 813.418(10) nm, in agreement
with [6].

With potentially high atomic densities in an optical
lattice, characterization of density shifts is important.

cal (inner shaded area) errors.

We have ∼400 lattice sites with typically ∼250 atoms
per site, yielding densities of ∼1012 atoms/cm3. Vary-
ing the atomic density by a factor of 50 (Fig. 4(b)), we
ﬁnd the density shift at our typical operating density of
2 × 1012 atoms/cm3 to be 2(13) Hz. Asymmetric popula-
tion distributions among 1S0 ground state mF sublevels
can lead to Zeeman shifts of the transition frequency. We
measured a shift of 32 Hz/G (Fig. 4(c)). By keeping the
magnetic ﬁeld <400 mG during spectroscopy, the Zee-
man shift uncertainty is 12 Hz. The probe beam itself
can induce a frequency shift through two diﬀerent phys-
ical mechanisms. The ﬁrst is the AC Stark shift of the
1S0 and 3P0 levels due to their couplings to other states

4

by the probe laser. For our investigation, the AC Stark
shift due to the probe laser was exacerbated by using an
electro-optic (EO) modulator to probe the atoms with
a weak sideband while retaining an oﬀ resonant carrier
for use in our ﬁber noise cancellation signal. The second
frequency shift mechanism arises from the posssibility of
a small probe beam misalignment with respect to the
lattice laser, permitting photon recoil shifts in the trans-
verse direction of the optical trap. We could separate
these power-dependent eﬀects by either varying the total
698 nm light intensity incident on the atoms or changing
the relative carrier-sideband amplitude through the EO
modulation index. We determined each of these eﬀects
within 2 Hz uncertainty.

The frequency reference used for the optical measure-
ment was a hydrogen maser directly calibrated by the
NIST F1 Cs fountain clock, available to us by an opti-
cal ﬁber link from NIST to JILA [25]. The approximate
14 m lower elevation of our JILA Sr experiment relative
to the NIST fountain clock introduced a < 1 Hz gravi-
tational shift. Including all systematic eﬀects discussed
above, the total uncertainty (added in quadrature) is 20
Hz. The ﬁnal number we report for the 87Sr 1S0 - 3P0
transition frequency is 429, 228, 004, 229, 867 ± 20(sys)
± 2.8(stat) Hz. We note this result disagrees by three
standard deviations with that of Ref. [6] measured with
a GPS-calibrated reference.

We have presented the most precise spectroscopic mea-
surement of the 87Sr 1S0 - 3P0 transition frequency in an
optical lattice with extensive studies of systematic un-
certainties. We apply this high resolution spectroscopy
to investigating motional properties of lattice trapped Sr
atoms. This work demonstrates the strength of the sys-
tem for an optical atomic clock. Future work will improve
further upon the reported precision and accuracy.

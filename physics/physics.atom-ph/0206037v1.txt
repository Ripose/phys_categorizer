Abstract

Experimental studies of electron mobilities in Neon as a function of the gas density have per-

sistently shown mobilities up to an order of magnitude smaller than expected and predicted. A

previously ignored mechanism (gas in–homogeneity which is negligible in the thermal mobilities for

He and other gases) is found to reproduce the observed Neon mobilities accurately and simply at

ﬁve temperatures with just one variable parameter. Recognizing that a gas is not a homogeneous

medium, a variation in local density combined with the quantum multi–scattering theory, shifts the

energy and cross section – which in turn changes the collision probability and ﬁnally the mobilities.

A lower density where a momentum transfer interaction occurs moves the mobility strongly in the

same direction as the anomalous experiments. By going backwards from the observed mobilities,

the collision frequency at each temperature and density is made to reproduce the experimental data

by looking for the local (as opposed to average) density at which the (rare) momentum transfer

interactions occur. These density deviations give a picture of the size and behavior of the wave

packets for electron motion which looks very much like the often discussed wave function collapse.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the response of excess electrons in gases under the action of an externally

applied electric ﬁeld has attracted the attention of many researchers since very early times.

On one hand, at quite low density, electron mobility measurements have been carried out to

determine the electron-atom momentum-transfer scattering cross section in the framework

of the traditional approach of the Boltzmann equation.

On the other hand, the transport properties of electrons in dense gases1 and liquids2

have also been and still are subject of extensive studies because of their potentiality in

technologically relevant applications, such as high-energy particle detectors, as well as for

the rich wealth of information they can provide on the basic physical mechanism of electron-

atom interaction in disordered and condensed media.

The mobility of extra electrons can be used as a probe to investigate the nature, energetics

and dynamics of electron states in a disordered medium and their evolution as a function

of the gas density. In particular, the research is aimed at investigating the transition from

classical single scattering in the completely dilute phase to multiple scattering and weak

localization at low and moderate densities and ﬁnally leading to the formation of fully

localized3 or extended4 states in the condensed phase.

Dense gases are the simplest realization of dense disordered systems and the problem

of the electron motion in a dense environment of randomly located scatterers is a model

problem for several phenomena in various areas of physics, such as the physics of doped

semiconductors, non polar liquids, electrolytes in solution, non ideal plasmas.

The classical theory of scattering in the binary collisions approximation predicts that the

electron mobility µ depends on the nature of the electron-atom interaction potential through

the momentum transfer scattering cross section, and also on the gas temperature, on the

applied electric ﬁeld E, and that it is inversely proportional to the gas density N, so that

the so called density–normalized mobility µ0N at thermal energy (i.e., at zero electric ﬁeld)
does not depend on the density5.

However, experiments have revealed anomalous density eﬀects on the electron zero-ﬁeld

mobility. It is now well established that in certain gases µ0N decreases with increasing N,

thus showing a negative density eﬀect, while in other gases the anomalous eﬀect is positive,

i.e., µ0N increases with N.

2

The amount of the density eﬀect is a function of several factors, including gas density and

temperature. Among the noble gases, µ0N decreases by a factor

less at higher temperatures8,9.

The sign of the density eﬀect on the electron mobility has been found experimentally to

depend on the sign of the electron-atom scattering length A, which distinguishes whether

an atom attract or repels low energy electrons. It is observed that the eﬀect has a sign in

the opposite direction to A. The eﬀect is positive for attractive gases such as Ar with A < 0

and negative for He and Ne with A > 0. The reasons for this are not immediately obvious

and depend on the way that the quantum multiple scattering theory aﬀects the mobility.

The multiple scattering theory (MS) of waves10,11,12 treats the environment in which a

propagating electron wave is immersed as a Fermi’s13 inﬁnite sea of atoms which acts as a po-

tential well or barrier depending on whether the atoms attract or repel low energy electrons.

At ﬁnite densities MS is a source of potential scattering, as distinct from the (relatively rare)

momentum transfer interactions which change the electron’s total asymptotic energy.

The real part ∆ of its eﬀect raises or lowers the electron’s kinetic energy level accordingly.

Its imaginary part Γ acts rather as a quantum energy uncertainty or width which is associated

with possible barrier tunneling.

The density eﬀect in attractive gases is a straightforward application of multiple scattering

theory. Starting with the classical equation for the mobility given by Huxley and Crompton5

and assuming the gas to be a homogeneous medium, one simply adds the shift to the electron

energy.

When MS shifts the electron energy, this change is passed directly from energy to cross

section to collision frequency – to electron energy distribution function – and ﬁnally to

mobility. For Ar these changes predicted the observed density eﬀects always in the direction

found by experiment and with at least fair accuracy. However the eﬀect for repulsive gases

is not so simple and direct.

In the repulsive gases at the highest densities and low temperature, the electron-atom

repulsion may be so eﬀective as to give origin to the formation of electron states localized

inside ﬂuid dilations named bubbles, as it is well known in liquid He14 and Ne15, dense He

gas16 and dense Ne gas17. No such an eﬀect has been observed in gases with a positive

(the subject of present interest) it is now commonly accepted that multiple scattering theory

has the eﬀect of deﬁning a mobility edge18 such that electron states with large wavelength

compared to their mean free path are eﬀectively localized and do not propagate.

The mobility edge, as found by OMalley in 198019 and from a diﬀerent point of view

in 199220, is deﬁned in Sec.

II below with the corresponding equations for electron mo-

bility. Alternative theories involving a mobility edge have also been advanced by other

researchers21,22,23. ions shown in Sec. II below predicted fairly closely the negative density

eﬀect in He, H2, and CO2 and were expected to be valid for any repulsive gas. Figure 1 shows

a typical case of the predicted and observed density eﬀect in He at 77K. However, when the

Neon data appeared17,24, the relative values of its density–normalized mobilities for T=46.5

and 47.9K were reduced by a full order of magnitude beyond what was predicted, and this

disagreement persisted to room temperature. The low temperature situation is shown in

Figure 2 where the observed mobilities relative to the classical values (N = 0) are shown.

This strong disagreement shows that the theory was seriously insuﬃcient for the spe-

cial case of Neon and presents a serious challenge to theory if an uniﬁed picture is to be

maintained for the physical process of electron scattering oﬀ noble gas atoms in a dense

environment.

In Section III we reexamine the generally overlooked assumption that a gas may be always

treated as a homogeneous medium when electrons transfer momentum. What we have found

is that the Neon experiments themselves tell us (through the collision probability ν ) that the

assumption is not valid for Neon and that ν actually favors momentum transfers occurring

at densities less than the average.

II. EXISTING THEORY FOR THE THERMAL MOBILITY IN A GAS AS A HO-

MOGENEOUS MEDIUM

We start with an existing theory19,20 for drift and diﬀusion in a gas considered as ho-

mogeneous. Its basic component is the Boltzmann theory of Huxley and Crompton5 which

treats the electrons as freely propagating classical particles with the energy balance deter-

mined by their momentum–transfer collisions, but with the collision frequency at the point

of momentum transfer determined from the quantum mechanical cross section.

The eﬀect of elevated density is ﬁrst included through quantum multiple scattering the-

ory10,11,12, a generalization of the Fermi energy shift13. The theory predicts a complex shift

units (energy = p2 = v2). f (0) is the forward electron-atom scattering amplitude, A is the

scattering length, σ is its momentum transfer cross-section, and v is the electron’s classical

velocity (v = p/m).

For the present case of Neon, a repulsive gas (negative scattering length A) as is He, the

problems created by shifting the lowest electron energy in the negative direction was solved

in terms of a mobility edge Ec

18, and resulted in the following equation for the electron’s

The initial p in the integrand of Eq. 4 is the velocity (in a.u.), whose energy integral

determines the drift velocity vD = (µN)

(E/N). It eﬀectively cancels the p factor in the

collision frequency ν (Eq. 9 below) so that the mobility in a repulsive gas depends eﬀectively

on 1/σ rather than on 1/(σv).

In Eq. 4, the shifted energy of propagation is p2 is deﬁned by

limit for diﬀusing electrons26. Finally the very important collision frequency ν in eq. 4,

which directly determines the mobility or drift velocity, is

ν = Nσv = Nσ(p2)p

where 1/N here is a measure of the volume over which the collision frequency (probability)

is determined, and Nloc is the local density where the average momentum transfer occurs.

It is interesting that ¯hν is equal to the mobility edge Ec, and also to Γ, the imaginary

part of the multiple energy shift. Γ was originally identiﬁed as the mobility edge in 1980

with Eq. 4 predicting the electron mobilities closely in He, H2, N2 and CO2 with no free
parameters19.

III. TREATING THE GAS AS AN INHOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM (NEON)

The completely unexpected observations of Borghesani et al.17,24 in Neon have shown that

the model in Sec. II (MS theory in a gas treated as homogeneous) is deﬁnitely overlooking

something if it is to describe the special case of Neon as well.

In fact no gas is truly a homogeneous medium. A gas is rather a collection of individual

atoms whose range for interacting with an electron wave is very small (a few atomic units).

Therefore, in the region where a collision actually occurs, the local average density of atoms

may be more or less than the global average density N.

There was an earlier diﬀerent but equally anomalous density eﬀect observed by Schwarz27

in He. As the electric ﬁeld strength was increased, the density eﬀect rapidly increased from

very negative up to zero and above. The eﬀect of increasing the electric ﬁeld is governed by

the energy distribution function5, and the eﬀect was ﬁnally understood and reproduced20

by recognizing ﬁrst that the density need not be the same everywhere and second that

the experiments were showing that the collisions which determines the energy distribution

function throught the collision frequency have a strong preference for occurring in regions

of less than average density.

7

For the present case of thermal Neon mobility, Borghesani and Santini17,24 noticed that

adding a Fermi shift

∆ could move the mobility strongly in the direction of their anomalous

experimental data, and also that the long–wavelength limit of the structure factor S(0)

−

needed to be included.

The theory in Sec.

II already incorporates the full eﬀect of the average density N.

However, where the local density in Neon as an inhomogeneous medium is less than N, the

local density Nloc is reduced by

where δ is deﬁned as δ = (N

Nloc)/N. This further shifts the energy p2 of Eq. 6 by the

Fermi shift ∆ of Eq. 2 to

If Nloc < N, i.e., if ∆N =

Nδ is negative (δ > 0), then ∆ for Ne or He in Eq. 11

increases the energy of propagation p2 and σ(p2) and, by Eq. 9, increases the collision

frequency ν (which determines both the distribution function and the mobility).

Thus, collisions are more probable at lower densities, and a larger ν also decreases the

mobility µ, moving it in the direction of the experiment, as was noted by Borghesani and

Santini17,24. (Conversely, where ∆N is positive the mobility would be moved away from

experiment, but this is less probable and so the smaller densities should dominate.)

IV. PROCEDURE

Starting from the above pressure eﬀect model of sections II and III, with the eﬀects of

multiple scattering, Kubo diﬀusion and the structure factor S(0) given and the e–Ne cross

sections determined28 as functions of energy it remains only to explore the eﬀect of possible

local density deﬁcits δ of Eq. 10 on the mobilities to be calculated.

In particular we look to see how the ∆N’s change the mobilities and whether a simple

choice of δ’s can match all the observed mobilities as a function of temperature and density.

We have already shown how only negative values of the variation ∆N from average can

move the mobility in the direction of experiment.

VI. DISCUSSION

A. Neon vs. Helium

Given the dramatic eﬀect that inhomogeneities have on thermal mobilities in Neon, why

is the same not true in He where the homogeneous gas model with no free parameters19

predicts the mobilities very well?

The answer is that the thermal mobility (Eq. 4) is determined by 1/σ. In He the cross

section is nearly constant, while in Neon it varies rapidly with energy especially at the lowest

energies.

On the other hand, Schwarz27 found a dramatic eﬀect for the electric ﬁeld dependence of

the non–thermal mobilities which was explained by a crude inhomogeneous gas model20.

The reason that the electric ﬁeld dependence in He is sensitive to density variations (unlike

its mobility) is that, although the He cross section varies hardly at all, the contributions to

the electron energy distribution are determined at small ﬁelds by ν2 = (Nσp)2 by Eq. 5. So

it is the signiﬁcant shift in the momentum p that causes Schwarz’ eﬀect. (Unfortunately the

10

m
very small size of the Neon cross sections makes this electric ﬁeld eﬀect barely signiﬁcant in

Neon).

B. Temperature dependence of the density defects δ

Figure 5 shows the values of our empirical δ as a function of temperature. They lie almost

precisely on a straight line going from 9% at 47 K to 59% at 294 K and vanishing at T=0. As

a result, the experiments at all 5 temperatures and moderate densities are all ﬁtted closely

by a δ(T ) curve with an only single variable parameter

δ = 0.202 T

(12)

The close agreement seems remarkable in view of the anomalous nature of the observations

and their great distance from what was previously understood. What the agreement seems

to be saying is the following.

According to the experiments and Eq.

12 the density deﬁcit is proportional to T,

which is itself proportional to the inverse square of the electron’s thermal wavelength

λT = h/√2mπkBT . It follows that λ2

T goes to inﬁnity at T = 0 K and so the density

sampled over such a range can only be the average N. This means that δ must be zero there

as Eq. 12 predicts. And, as T increases the area λ2

T decreases. The smaller area allows

But what is the signiﬁcance of the area λ2

T ? The interaction of an electron with an atom

is known to be limited to a distance no greater than a wavelength. Thus, as the electron’s

wavepacket advances forward, λ2

T may be interpreted as a measure of the largest area over

which it can overlap with the e–atom interaction and sample the local density.

C. The quantum inferences

The theory used in this work starts with pure Boltzmann theory at very low density,

but uses quantum cross sections for the important momentum-transfer collision frequency5.

It describes an electron moving classically in a well deﬁned direction from one momen-

tum/energy transfer to the next.

However, in light of quantum theory, we know that the electrons motion is physically

described by a wave function spreading out broadly, with Feynman paths passing through

every atom in its forward direction. The total wave may alternately be represented as a

superposition of wave packets, each beginning at the electron’s starting point and ending on

a possible interaction with an individual atom in its path. For each wave packet, there is a

well deﬁned momentum vector in between the starting point and any atom.

What the earlier close agreement of the classical Boltzmann theory with the low density

experiments indicates is that, after a momentum/energy transfer with one atom, the electron

moves forward starting from that one point. In other words all the remaining members of

the original superposition become irrelevant as the electron must be continuing on from the

point of momentum transfer as a new wave.

The narrowing of the original superposition plus the electron continuing from that point

closely parallels Keller’s derivation29 of wave function collapse in which he proved, using con-

ditional probability theory, that a direct observation results in a collapsed single component

wave–function at the observation point ready to continue from there.

What these results add to Keller’s conclusion is that observation may be generalized to

momentum transfer interaction. More detailed evidence of this collapse to something like a

particle has been seen at higher densities, particularly in neon gas.

When the density N was increased in electron mobility experiments, known density de-

pendent mechanisms were recognized as inﬂuencing the outcome, the principal one being

the multiple scattering of waves.

12

What this mechanism does ﬁrst is to modify the electron wave–function’s kinetic energy,

and therefore its collision frequency ν (Eq.9) by the density dependent kinetic energy shift

∆ (Eq. 2). (

∆ is the cumulative potential energy of the electron summed over all the

−

atoms in the full wave propagating wave-function).

This potential scattering, resulting from multiple scattering, is in addition to the rare

energy exchange at the actual momentum transfers. The latter is completely determined by

ν, as well as the energy balance, through g(ǫ), (Eq. 5).

D. The present Neon case

With Neon as the gas, the fact that its scattering cross section is close to zero and

changing rapidly makes the collision frequency exceptionally sensitive to gas density where

momentum transfers occur. This sensitivity enabled us, as discussed above, to explain and

predict the anomalous density eﬀect in Neon and also to discover that these transfers were

occurring mostly at local densities less than the average one N by an amount proportional

to the temperature.

The fact that the present model’s densities at points of momentum transfer were found to

be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the average N implies that the individual wave packet at the

interaction, even before moving forward, is more compact than the full wave packet during

its propagation - making it look much more like a particle there.

This presently inferred shrinking or collapse of the electron’s extended wave packet at

the point of momentum transfer is further evidence of the behavior of the wave function

demonstrated by Keller about the point of observation.

Our ﬁnding from the experiments that the density defect δ is such that at most momentum

transfers Nloc can diﬀer from the average N by as much as 59 % accordingly shows that

the wave function for an electron’s motion, where it interacts, is very much smaller than

the free propagating wave function. It might understandably be called a particle – as in

the photoelectric eﬀect, where light waves become point–like photons when they exchange

energy and momentum with electrons in a metal, or the way photons and electrons were

described earlier when they were emitted or observed.

Where the present ﬁnding from Neon mobilities diﬀers from Keller’s is ﬁrst that it is the

wave and wave packet for electron motion which shrinks and second that the collapse–like

13

behavior happens at every momentum/energy transfer whether or not it is observed directly.

VII. SUMMARY

A straight-forward extension of existing theoretical models, combining the inhomogeneous

nature of a gas with multiple scattering theory, has been found to reproduce the anomalous

and previously puzzling measurements of the pressure eﬀect on electron mobilities in Neon

gas at 5 temperatures and moderate densities both simply and accurately with only one

variable parameter - the deviation δ (proportional to the temperature) of local from average

gas density at actual momentum transfers.

The special window that these, and also previous, electron mobility experiments oﬀer on

fundamental quantum processes was also discussed.

Further experimental investigations of this kind of relation between collisions in a gas

and electron (or atom wave) packets are strongly recommended.

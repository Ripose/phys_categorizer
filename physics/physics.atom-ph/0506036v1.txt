A new scheme for the numerical evaluation of the one-loop self-energy correction to all orders in Zα is
presented. The scheme proposed inherits the attractive features of the standard potential-expansion method but
yields a partial-wave expansion that converges more rapidly than in the other methods reported in the literature.

INTRODUCTION

Calculations of the one-loop self-energy correction to all
orders in the parameter Zα (Z is the nuclear charge number
and α is the ﬁne-structure constant) have a long history. The
ﬁrst correct evaluation of this correction was performed for
several high-Z ions by Desiderio and Johnson [1] using the
method proposed by Brown, Langer, and Schaefer [2]. An-
other, much more accurate and powerful method was devel-
oped by Mohr [3], who carried out high-precision calculations
of this correction in a wide range of Z for the ground and the
ﬁrst excited states of H-like ions [4, 5, 6]. Various extensions
of this method provided highly accurate evaluations of the
self-energy correction for higher excited states [7, 8], for the
extended-nucleus Coulomb potential [9], and for very small
nuclear charge numbers [10, 11, 12].
Indelicato and Mohr
[13, 14] presented an important modiﬁcation of the method,
in which renormalization is performed completely in coordi-
nate space.

A different method for evaluation of the self-energy cor-
rection, which can be conventionally termed as the potential-
expansion method, was introduced by Snyderman and Blun-
dell [15, 16, 17]. Various numerical schemes based on this
method were presented by other groups [18, 19].

There are also other methods developed for evaluation of
the self-energy correction which have been less widely used
so far. A noncovariant method of the so-called partial-wave
renormalization was developed by Persson, Lindgren, and Sa-
lomonson [20] and by Quiney and Grant [21, 22]. Another
method proposed by Labzowsky and Goidenko [23] is based
on the multiple commutator expansion of the general expres-
sions.

Closely related to the self-energy is the other dominant
QED effect, the vacuum-polarization. The ﬁrst evaluations of
this correction to all orders in Zα were performed by Soff and
Mohr [24] and by Manakov, Nekipelov, and Fainstein [25].
More accurate calculations of the vacuum-polarization correc-
tion were carried out later by other groups [26, 27].

Evaluation of the self-energy correction for a tightly bound
electron is nontrivial, to a large extent, due to the fact that this
correction involves the Dirac-Coulomb Green function that is
not presently known in the closed analytical form (contrary to
the nonrelativistic Coulomb Green function). Consequently,
the self-energy correction is expressed as an inﬁnite expan-

sion over the angular momentum of the virtual photon (or,
equivalently, the total angular momentum of the virtual elec-
tron states j =
1/2, where κ is the relativistic angular-
momentum parameter of the Dirac equation). This expan-
sion (further referred to as the partial-wave expansion) greatly
complicates calculations of the self-energy corrections.

In the method by Mohr [3], the summation of the partial-
wave expansion was performed numerically before integra-
tions over radial coordinates. A large number of terms in-
104) and usage of the quadruple
cluded into the summation (
arithmetics ensured a high accuracy of the numerical results
obtained but made the computation rather time consuming. In
the extension of this method by Jentschura et al. [10, 11, 12],
several millions of expansion terms included into computa-
tion were reported, which became possible due to an elaborate
convergence-acceleration technique developed by the authors
and an extensive usage of modern parallel computer systems.
On the contrary, calculations based on the potential-
expansion method [16, 17, 18, 19] are usually performed with
much smaller numbers of partial-wave expansion terms ac-
tually included into the computation (
40). This is
achieved (i) by employing a more complete set of renormal-
ization terms that are calculated separately in a closed form,
(ii) by performing the radial integrations before the partial-
wave summation (for the discussion of how this inﬂuences the
convergence rate see Eqs. (1), (2) of Ref. [14] and the related
text there), and (iii) by using extrapolation to estimate the con-
tribution of the tail of the expansion. The price to pay is a
more complex structure of the subtraction terms (especially,
in coordinate space) and the necessity to keep the accuracy
of numerical integrations well under control for each partial-
wave term, in order to provide a reasonable extrapolation for
the tail of the expansion. Still, the method is computationally
very cheap and can be directly generalized for calculations of
higher-order QED diagrams, where the self-energy loop en-
ters as a subgraph. These advantages have determined the fact
that most calculations of higher-order self-energy corrections
have been performed by extensions of the potential-expansion
method up to now.

The one-loop self-energy correction is traditionally repre-
sented in terms of the dimensionless function F (Zα), which
is connected to the energy shift (in units ~ = c = m = 1) by

∆E =

roughly follows the dependence

This makes clear that, while the nominal rate of convergence

of the partial-wave expansion is always close to

method, the actual convergence is governed by the parame-
ter n3/(Zα)2, whose numerical value can be rather large for
excited states and small nuclear-charge numbers. Taking into
account that the extension of the partial-wave summation be-
yond the typical limit of
40 leads to serious tech-
= 30
nical problems within the numerical scheme employed, we
conclude that the parameter n3/(Zα)2 deﬁnes the region of
the practical applicability of the potential-expansion method.
Similar situation persists in calculations of self-energy cor-
rections to higher orders of perturbation theory. In such cal-
culations, the convergence of the partial-wave expansion also
worsens with decrease of Z and increase of n.
In particu-
lar, a slow convergence of this expansion turned out to be the
factor limiting the accuracy in evaluations of the self-energy
correction to the 1s and 2s hyperﬁne splitting in low-Z ions
[28, 29, 30]. This convergence also posed serious problems
in calculations of the self-energy correction to the bound-
electron g factor in light H-like ions [31, 32, 33, 34].

The convergence rate of the partial-wave expansion be-
comes most crucial in the case of two-loop self-energy cor-
rections, for which the summation should be performed over
two independent expansion parameters, both of which are un-
bound [35, 36]. A calculation of the two-loop self-energy cor-
rection for very low nuclear charge numbers (and, speciﬁcally,
for hydrogen) is a challenging problem, which apparently can-
not be solved within a straightforward generalization of the
potential-expansion method. (The present status of calcula-
tions of the two-loop self-energy correction can be found in
Ref. [37]). One of the problems to be solved to this end is
to ﬁnd a way to improve the convergence properties of the
partial-wave expansion.

The goal of the present investigation is to formulate a
scheme for evaluation of the one-loop self-energy correction,
which yield the fastest convergence of the partial-wave expan-
sion among the methods reported so far in the literature.

it is assumed that the unrenormalized part of the expression
and the mass counterterm are regularized in a certain covariant
way and that the limit removing the regularization is taken
after the cancellation of the divergent terms.

Ultraviolet divergencies in Eq. (3) can be conveniently iso-
lated by separating the ﬁrst two terms in the expansion of the
bound-electron propagator G in terms of the binding potential

high-energy part (CH ) and is similar to the one introduced in
our previous work [19]. The low-energy part of the contour
CL extends from
i0 on the lower bank of the
branch cut of the photon propagator and from +i0 to ε0 + i0
on the upper bank of the cut. In order to avoid appearance of
poles of the electron propagator near the integration contour,
each part of CL is bent into the complex plane if the calcula-
tion is performed for excited states. (The analytical structure
of the integrand and a possible choice of the contour are dis-
cussed in Ref. [19].) The high-energy part of the contour is

Coulomb Green function, the evaluation of the many-potential
term has to be performed by expanding G (and, therefore,
G(2+)) into eigenfunctions of the Dirac angular momentum
with the eigenvalue κ. As discussed in Introduction, the con-
vergence rate of the resulting partial-wave expansion is of cru-
cial importance for the numerical evaluation of the self-energy
correction.

Until this moment, our description closely followed the
standard potential-expansion method [15]. We would like
now to modify this method in order to achieve a better con-
vergence of the partial-wave expansion in the many-potential
term ∆Emany. To this end, we look for an approximation
G(2+)
to the function G(2+) that fulﬁlls the following require-
a
ments: (i) it can be evaluated in a closed form (i.e., without the
G(2+)
partial-wave expansion) and (ii) the difference G(2+)
a
inserted into Eq. (10) yields a rapidly converging partial-wave
series.

We start with the expansion of the bound-electron Green

Due to a lack of a closed-form representation for the Dirac

function in terms of the binding potential,

It is well known that the dominant contribution to radial in-
tegrals like those that appear in Eq. (10) originates from the
region where the radial arguments are close to each other,
x2. This region is also responsible for the part of
x1 ≈
the partial-wave expansion of the Green function that has the
[3]. In this region
slowest asymptotic convergence in 1/
the commutators of the potential V with the free Green func-
tion G(0) are small and can be neglected, which corresponds
to expanding V (z) in a Taylor series around z = x1 (or x2)
and keeping only the ﬁrst term. Commuting V out to the left
in Eq. (11) and repeatedly employing the identity

This expansion has a form of the Taylor series and can be
formally summed up, yielding

Ga(E, x1, x2) = G(0)(E + Ω, x1, x2) ,

(14)

where Ω =
V (x1) = Zα/x1. Commuting V out to the
right in Eq. (11), we obtain the same representation for Ga
but with Ω = Zα/x2.

It should be noted that the idea of commuting the poten-
tial V outside in the one-potential term was ﬁrst proposed
by Mohr [3], who proved that this procedure does not in-
ﬂuence the asymptotic ultraviolet behavior of this term (we
recall that ultraviolet divergences originate from the region
x2 in conﬁguration space). Later, it was also demon-
x1 ≈
strated [13, 14] that all ultraviolet divergences in the one-loop
self-energy correction could be identiﬁed by isolating several
ﬁrst terms of the power-series expansion of the potential V
and the reference-state wave functions ψa around the point
x1 = x2.

Expression (14) yields an approximation for the bound-
electron Green function that has a form of the free Green func-
tion with a shifted energy argument. Taking into account that
the free Green function is known in a closed form [3]

employed

We now use the approximate expression for the Green func-
tion obtained above in order to separate the many-potential
term (10) into two parts, one of which contains G(2+)
in-
stead of G(2+) and is evaluated in a closed form in conﬁgura-
tion space, whereas the remainder is calculated by summing a
rapidly-converging partial-wave series. Bearing in mind that
the partial-wave expansion for the low-energy part of Eq. (10)
is already converging very fast (if the parameter ε0 of the in-
tegration contour CLH is chosen as described above), we ap-
ply this separation to the high-energy part only. The many-
potential term is thus written as a sum of the subtraction and
the remainder term,

∆Emany = ∆E sub

a 3-dimensional integration over the radial variables to be per-

III. NUMERICAL EVALUATION

The numerical evaluation of the self-energy correction
within the present scheme is in many respects similar to
that in the standard potential-expansion approach. Since the
potential-expansion method is well documented (see, e.g., a
detailed description in Ref. [19]), here we concentrate on
novel features of our evaluation as compared to the standard
approach. They appear in the calculations of (i) the high-
energy part of the many-potential remainder term ∆E remd
many
and (ii) the many-potential subtraction term ∆E sub

many.

Numerical evaluation of the radial integrals is complicated
[speciﬁcally, for small values of Re(ω)] by the presence of
the function G(0)(E + Ω) in the integrand. To explain this,

governed by the parameter c ′ =

For certain values of x1 and x2, Re (E + Ω) = 1. When

(E + Ω)2 occurs in the vicinity of this point, which

can lead to a numerical instability of the radial integrations.

This problem was handled by breaking the integration inter-
val at the point where Re (E + Ω) = 1 and employing a larger
number of integration points in this region.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Tables I, II, and III we present a comparison of two
different schemes for the evaluation of the self-energy cor-
rection for the 1s, 2s, and 2p1/2 states. The labels “A” and
“B” stand for the subtraction scheme introduced in this work
and for the standard potential-expansion approach, respec-
tively. The entry “Free” denotes the sum of the zero- and
one-potential terms (this part is the same in both methods),
“Subtraction” stands for the many-potential subtraction term
∆E sub
many (absent in the standard approach), whereas the in-
dividual partial-wave expansion contributions correspond to

The comparison of the data listed in the tables demonstrates
that the additional subtraction introduced in this work leads
to a signiﬁcant improvement of the convergence properties of
the partial-wave expansion in all the cases studied.
It also
indicates that the new approach is applicable for the evaluation
of the self-energy correction in the low-Z region, where the
standard potential-expansion approach fails to yield accurate
results.

In the low-Z region, one has to deal with numerical can-
cellations between individual contributions to the self-energy
correction. The origin of these cancellations are spurious
terms of order α(Zα)2 ln Zα that appear in the Feynman
gauge when the self-energy correction is separated into the
zero, one, and many-potential terms [15] and that have to be
cancelled numerically in order to obtain the physical contri-
bution to order α(Zα)4. In our approach, the numerical inte-
grations can be relatively easily performed up to a sufﬁcient
accuracy, so that the numerical cancellations do not pose any
serious problems. Even in the most difﬁcult case, Z = 1, the
present numerical scheme yields a result with a reasonable ac-
curacy, F1s(1α) = 10.316 85(10), which is in a good agree-
ment with the most precise value by Jentschura et al. [11],
F1s(1α) = 10.316 793 650(1).

In Table IV we present the numerical results for the self-
energy correction in the region that was not previously tab-
ulated in the literature, 5 < Z < 10, and compare our nu-
merical values for Z = 5 and 10 with evaluations by other
authors. It is noteworthy that unlike the previous calculations
summarized in Table IV, our evaluation is computationally
very cheap. The time of the calculation for one value of Z
is less than 1h on a modern personal computer. This feature
makes the present approach very promising for extensions to
the higher-order self-energy corrections.

To sum up, we have developed a highly efﬁcient scheme for
the evaluation of the one-loop self-energy correction for an
electron bound in a symmetric local potential (not necessarily
the Coulomb one). The approach presented inherits the attrac-
tive features of the standard potential-expansion method but
yields a much better convergence rate for the resulting partial-
wave expansion. As a result, the applicability of the potential-
expansion method is extended into the region of large values
of the parameter n3/(Zα)2. We expect that the approach de-
veloped will allow one to signiﬁcantly improve accuracy of
evaluations of the self-energy correction to the hyperﬁne split-
ting and of the screened self-energy correction in the low-Z
region and could be also applied for higher-order self-energy
corrections.

Abstract

We provide a systematic derivation of the scaling behaviour of various quantities
and establish in particular the scale invariance of the ionization probability. We
discuss the gauge invariance of the scaling properties and the manner in which
they can be exploited as a consistency check in explicit analytical expressions, in
perturbation theory, in the Kramers-Henneberger and Floquet approximation, in
upper and lower bound estimates and fully numerical solutions of the time dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. The scaling invariance leads to a diﬀerential equation which
has to be satisﬁed by the ionization probability and which yields an alternative
criterium for the existence of atomic bound state stabilization.

Introduction

It is up to now still not possible to carry out computations of ionization probabilities
or ionization rates in the high intensity regime in a totally satisfactory manner.
In
particular analytical results are extremely rare. Especially concerning the issue of so-
called atomic stabilization [1], numerous computations may be found in the literature
which are contradictory in many cases. Alone for the relatively simple problem of the
one-dimensional delta-potential there exist various recent computations which do [2, 3]
or do not [4, 5] support the existence of stabilization. Roughly speaking, stabilization
is the eﬀect that the ionization probability (or ionization rate to some authors) as a
function of the laser ﬁeld intensity is decreasing or constant in some region. For fur-
ther references and a more detailed terminology, that is, a distinction into transient,
adiabatic, interference or resonance stabilization, see for instance [6].

It would be highly desirable to settle the controversial issue and pinpoint possible
mistakes, erroneous physical or mathematical assumptions made in the course of the
computations. The main intention of this note is to contribute to this debate and
provide additional alternative consistency criteria. For this purpose we analyze the
scaling behaviour of several quantities involved in the calculations which address the
above-mentioned problem. This constitutes an adaptation of an idea which has been
proved to be extremely powerful in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, for instance in
form of the renormalization group ﬂow (see almost any book on quantum ﬁeld theory).
In the context of atomic physics, scaling laws have been considered before [7] in a
“semiempirical” fashion, as the authors refer themselves to their own analysis. In order
to overcome the slightly ad hoc way of arguing we provide in this note a systematic
derivation of various scaling laws, which are compatible with the ones proposed in [7].
In particular, we establish the scale invariance property of the ionization probability. As
a consequence one may exploit these symmetry properties and check various analytical as
well as numerical expressions for the ionization probability for consistency. In addition,
when considering the ionization probability as a function of various parameters the scale
invariance property allows to trade one particular variable for others. This permits to
interpret and rigorously explain various types of behaviour which occurred before for
more speciﬁc situations in the literature. For instance, for the Hydrogen atom it was
found in [8] that for increasing principal quantum number the ionization probability
decreased and in [9] the opposite behaviour was observed. Our analysis culminates in
the formulation of a simple alternative criterium for the existence of stabilization.

Our manuscript is organized as follows: In section 2 we derive systematically the
scaling properties of various quantities and establish in particular the invariance of the
ionization probability under scaling. We show that this property is preserved under
gauge invariance. Furthermore, the scale invariance can be exploited as a consistency
check in various computations. We exhibit this for explicit analytical expressions, for
perturbative calculations, for approximate evaluations in form of Kramers-Henneberger-
and Floquet states and for upper and lower bound estimates. We demonstrate how
the scaling properties can be exploited to trade some variables for others and use this
feature to explain several types of physical behaviour. As a consequence of our analysis
in section 2, we provide in section 3 a diﬀerential equation which has to be satisﬁed by
the ionization probability and an alternative criterium for the existence of stabilization.

We state our conclusions in section 4.

2 Scaling behaviour of ionization probabilities

We consider an atom with potential V (~x) in the presence of a suﬃciently intense laser
ﬁeld, such that it may be described in the non-relativistic regime by the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation in the dipole approximation

We further take the pulse to be of the general form

∆ + V (~x) + e ~x

ψ(~x, t) = H (~x, t) ψ(~x, t).

(1)

~E(t) = ~E0f (t)

where f (t) is a function whose integral over t is assumed to be well behaved, with
τ . This means τ is the pulse duration, f (t) the pulse shape

function and E0 the amplitude of the pulse, which we take to be positive without loss
of generality.

Denoting by λ > 0 the dilatation factor and by η the scaling dimension of the
eigenfunction ϕ(~x) := ψ(~x, t = 0) of the Hamiltonian H (~x, t = 0), we consider the
following scale transformations1

~x′ = λ~x

and

ϕ(~x)

ϕ′(~x′) = λ−ηϕ(~x) .

Making the physical assumption that the Hilbert space norm remains invariant, i.e.
, we deduce immediately that the scaling dimension has to be η = d/2,
k
with d being the dimension of the space. Introducing now the scaling of the dimensional
parameters ℏ, me and e as

we can scale the whole problem to atomic units, i.e. ℏ = e = me, for instance by
the choice λ = ℏ, ηℏ =
logℏ(me). Staying for the
time being in these units the scaling behaviour (3) may be realized by scaling the
coupling constant. Considering for instance the wavefunction ϕ(x) = √α exp(
)
x
|
|
of the only bound state when the potential in (1) is taken to be the one-dimensional
delta-potential V (x) = αδ(x), equation (3) imposes that the coupling constant has
α′ = λ−1α. Choosing instead the Coulomb potential in the form
to scale as α
V (~x) = α/r requires the same scaling behaviour of the coupling constant for (3) to
be valid. This is exhibited directly by the explicit expressions of the corresponding
wavefunctions ϕnlm(~x)

n+l (2αr/n) (see e.g. [10]).

α3/2(αr)l exp(

From a physical point of view it is natural to require further, that the scaling be-

1More formally we could also carry out all our computations by using unitary dilatation oparators
(λ~x) and

U (λ), such that the transformation of the eigenfunction is described by U (λ)ϕ(~x) = ληϕ′
operators O acting on ϕ(~x) transform as U (λ)OU (λ)

Here T denotes the time ordering. Equation (6) then suggests that the scaling of the
time has to be compensated by the scaling of the Hamiltonian and Planck’s constant in
order to achieve invariance. Scaling therefore the time as

t′ = ληtt ,

with ηt being unknown for the moment, equation (6) only holds if the Stark Hamiltonian

The properties (7) and (8) could also be obtained by demanding the invariance of the
Schr¨odinger equation (1). The overall scaling behaviour of H (~x, t) is governed by the
scaling of the Laplacian, the electron mass and Planck’s constant, such that we obtain
the further constraint

As a consequence we can read oﬀ the scaling properties of the potential as

What does this behaviour imply for some concrete potentials? Having scaled everything
to atomic units, relation (9) suggests that ηH =
2. Considering for this situation
the one-dimensional delta-potential and the Coulomb potential in the forms speciﬁed
α′ = λ−1α
above, equation (10) imposes that the coupling constant has to scale as α
in both cases. This behaviour of the coupling constant is in agreement with our earlier
observations for the corresponding wavefunctions. We also observe immediately that
the behaviour (10) may be realized for the general class of Kato small potentials. We
recall that if for each constant β with 0 < β < 1 there exists a constant γ, such that
∆/2), the potential V
holds for all ψ in the domain

It is intriguing to note that there exists an interesting class of potentials which scale
alone via their dependence on ~r and which do not contain any energy scale α at all, as
for instance V (~x) = 1/r2 or the two-dimensional delta potential.

In [7] the interesting proposal was made to exploit the scaling behaviour in order
to use known properties of the Hydrogen atom to understand the behaviour of Helium.
For this purpose the Schr¨odinger equation describing Helium, i.e. (1), for the potential
Ze2/r and the mass me replaced by the reduced mass µ, is scaled to the
VHe (~x) =
one which describes Hydrogen. Translating the quantities of [7] into our conventions
this transformation is realized by λ = (µ/me)Z, ηt = logλ(Z 2µ/me), ηµ = logλ(me/µ),

logλ Z and ηℏ = ηe = 0. These quantities are consistent with the additional
ηZ =
2, which results for the potential VHe (~x) from the scaling
constraint ηH = 2ηℏ
arguments. We would like to point out that this is only one of many possible choices.
It might be more convenient to use for instance λ = Z, ηt = 2, ηµ = ηℏ = ηZ + 1 =
logZ(me/µ) and ηe = 0 instead.
We will now consider the constraint resulting from equation (8) on the scaling behaviour
of the pulse. We have

with ηE = ηH −

This equation is not quite as restrictive as for the potential, since in the latter case we
could determine the behaviour of the coupling whereas now a certain ambiguity remains
in the sense that we can only deduce

~E0 →

~E

0 = ληEo ~E0 ,

f (t)

f ′

= ληf f (t) , with ηE0 + ηf = ηE .

(cid:1)

Thus, under the assumptions we have made, it is not possible to disentangle the contri-
bution coming from the scaling of the amplitude or the pulse shape function. However,
there might be pulse shape functions for which hf has to be 0, since no suitable param-
eter is available in its explicit form to achieve the scaling.

Finally, we come to the scaling behaviour of the ionization probability. Denoting by
P the orthogonal projection in L2(IR3) onto the subspace spanned by the bound states
of H (~x, t = 0), the ionization probability turns out to be a scale invariant quantity

This follows by means of (3), (6) and by noting that the projection operator has to be
P ′ = P . From a physical point of view this is clear
a scale invariant quantity, i.e. P
unless we were able to scale bound states into the continuum, which is impossible, since
negative energies will remain always negative even after being scaled. Mathematically
this means we have to demand that P ′ and P are related to each other by a unitary
transformation.

We recapitulate that our sole assumptions in this derivation were to demand the

We shall now utilize this symmetry property in various approaches, which can be
carried out either numerically or analytically. At this point we scale everything to atomic
units which we will use from now onwards.

2.1 Gauge invariance

First of all we would like to establish that these scaling properties hold in every gauge, as
one naturally expects. We recall that diﬀerent gauges are related by a time-dependent
unitary operator Ag2←g1(t). For instance the wavefunction in gauge g1 and gauge g2
are related as Ψg2(~x, t) = Ag2←g1(t)Ψg1(~x, t). The velocity gauge is obtained from the
length gauge by

Av←l(t) = ei~b(t)·~x

A′

v←l(t′) = Av←l(t)

(14)

→

(15)

(16)

the velocity gauge from the Kramers-Henneberger gauge by

Av←KH(t) = e−ia(t)ei~c(t)·~p

A′

v←KH(t′) = Av←KH(t)

→

and the length gauge from the Kramers-Henneberger gauge by

Al←KH(t) = e−ia(t)e−i~b(t)·~xei~c(t)·~p

A′

l←KH(t′) = Al←KH(t) .

→

The deﬁning relations for the classical momentum transfer ~b(t), the classical displace-
ment ~c(t) and the classical energy transfer ~a(t) then yield

~b(t) = ~E0b0(t) =

ds ~E(s)

~b′(t′) =

dsλ−3 ~E(sλ−2) = λ−1~b(t)

(17)

~c(t) = ~E0c0(t) =

ds~b(s)

~c′(t′) =

dsλ−1~b(sλ−2) = λ~c(t)

.

(19)

These quantities scale in the expected manner, that is ~b(t) scales as a momentum, ~c(t) as
the space and ~a(t) remains invariant. Taking these properties into account, we observe
easily that the operator Ag2←g1(t) is an invariant quantity under scaling

Ag2←g1(t)

A′

g2←g1(t) = Ag2←g1(t)

→

(20)

for all cases g1 and g2 mentioned. Hence the scaling behaviour is preserved in all gauges.
It is interesting to note that one may reverse the logic here and deduce from a broken
scale invariance onto a broken gauge invariance. However, in general gauge invariance
is not broken in such a crude manner, e.g.
in [11] (see eqn. (22) therein) the gauge
invariance is broken in a scale invariant fashion.

2.2 Symmetry properties for analytical expressions of

P

Keeping the pulse shape function invariant under the scaling transformations we in-
corporate now the explicit functional dependence into the ionization probability. The
fundamental parameters are the ﬁeld amplitude, the pulse length and the coupling con-
stant. The previous observations then suggest that

(E0, τ , α) =

(E′

0, τ ′, α′) .

P

P

(21)

Assuming from now on that the coupling constant scales as for the one-dimensional
delta- and the Coulomb potential, the meaning of equation (21) is that the ionization
probability remains invariant under the transformations

E0 →

0 = λ−3E0,

τ ′ = λ2τ ,

α′ = λ−1α .

(22)

We can exploit the symmetry property (21) most easily when we have an explicit ana-
(ϕ) at hand. Considering for example the δ-potential and taking
lytical expression for

(24)

probability of the bound state was computed to be [12]

Obviously the r.h.s. of (23) passes the test and remains invariant under the scale trans-
formation in form of (17) and (22).

2.3 Perturbation theory

Usually one is not in the fortunate situation to have explicit expressions for the ionization
probability available as in the previous subsection. However, the symmetry property may
also be utilized when computing
(ϕ) approximately either in a numerical or analytical
fashion. We recall that the essential ingredient of perturbation theory is to expand
the time evolution operator as a series in E0 or α for small or large ﬁeld intensities,
respectively. We can formally write

Whilst it was fairly obvious that the general expressions (26) and (27) remain invariant
under scaling, this consistency check might be less trivial when carried out after the
expressions have been evaluated explicitly either numerically or analytically.

2.4 Expansions in terms of Kramers-Henneberger states or Floquet

states

The essence of the Kramers-Henneberger approximation (e.g. [15]) is to exploit the fact
that when the gauge transformation (16) is carried out on the Stark Hamiltonian, the
term involving the laser pulse disappears and instead the potential is shifted by the total
classical displacement, i.e. V (~x)
~c(t)). Having chosen the pulse in such a way
that ~c(t) is a periodic function in time, one can expand the shifted potential in a Fourier
series

In the Kramers-Henneberger approximation one assumes now that the zero mode is
dominant such that the remaining terms may be treated as perturbations. From the
scaling behaviour of the l.h.s. of (28) we deduce immediately that the frequency has to
ω′ = λ−2ω, and that each mode in the series scales
scale inverse to the time, i.e. ω
in the same way as the potential, i.e.

(30)

As an example let us consider the expansion for a square-well potential of depth αV0 and
of width d subjected to a pulse of linearly polarized monochromatic light. The modes
are of the general form (ﬁrst reference in [15])

Vn =

αV0|
|

g[(d/2

−

x)ω2/E0] ,

where the explicit formula of the function g is given in term of Chebyshev-polynomials
which, however, is not important for our purpose. We only need to know that it scales
by means of its argument alone. Since the argument is scale invariant, we observe with
the help of (10) for ηH = 2 in atomic units that (29) holds for each coeﬃcient in (30).
The analysis of the scaling behaviour of the Floquet expansion is very similar. In-
stead of exploiting the periodicity of the potential one makes additional use of the
∞
n=−∞ ψn(~x)einωt. It is then obvious by
periodicity of the ﬁeld and expands ψ(~x, t) =
the same reasoning as before that the scaling of the individual modes has to be the same
as for the ﬁeld itself, i.e. ψn(~x)

n(~x′) = λ−d/2ψn(~x).

2.5 Upper and lower bounds

(ϕ)

Pl (ϕ)

Pl (ϕ),
In [13, 17, 16, 14] analytical expressions for upper and lower bounds,
Pu (ϕ) and
respectively, were derived and analyzed. Depending on the particular parameters these
expressions put more or less severe constraints on the actual value of
(ϕ), in the sense
that
(ϕ) is a scale invariant quantity, also the bounds
have to respect this symmetry. Otherwise they could be scaled to any desired value. We
present just one example for one particular upper bound (the arguments carry through
equally for lower bounds) to convince ourselves that this is indeed the case. For instance
under the condition b(τ )2/2 >
binding energy of ϕ, the following upper bound
was derived in [13]

≤ Pu (ϕ). Since

have already exploited this property.
In fact, we found that the bound (31) is only
considerably below 1 for very small values of the pulse length τ . Since the binding
E′ =
energy has to scale in the same manner as the Hamiltonian H(~x, t = 0), that is E
λ−2E, we could also, due to the scale invariance property, enlarge the pulse durations
by considering higher Rydberg states.
In this way we could study pulses which are
physically more conceivable, at the cost of having to deal with higher principal quantum
numbers.

2.6 Trading some variables for others

Of course the principle mentioned at the end of the last subsection is very general and we
may always trade some variables for others, simply by bringing the relevant λ’s in (22)
(E0, λ2τ , λ−1α) it
to the other side of the equation. For instance from
follows that instead of varying the ﬁeld amplitude and keeping τ and α ﬁxed, we could
equivalently keep E0 ﬁxed and vary simultaneously τ and α in the described fashion.
As a consequence we can give some alternative physical interpretation to the extreme
intensity limit considered in [17, 12]

This means switching oﬀ the potential and exposing the atom to an inﬁnitely long
pulse with some ﬁnite ﬁeld amplitude is equivalent to keeping the pulse length and the
coupling constant ﬁnite and taking the ﬁeld amplitude to inﬁnity.

behaviour, which at ﬁrst sight appears somewhat puzzling. In [12, 8] it was observed
that the ionization probability is sometimes a decreasing and sometimes an increasing
function of the coupling constant when the other parameters are kept ﬁxed, refer to
ﬁgure 1.

= 0 and in the latter b(τ )

Important for the explanation of this feature is that in the former case b(τ ) =
0, c(τ )
= 0, c(τ ) = 0. Assuming now that the dependence
of the ionization probability on the ﬁeld amplitude enters only through the quantities
b(τ ) and c(τ ) and in addition that the dependence on the pulse length is very weak in
comparison with the one on b(τ ), c(τ ) and α, according to the scale invariance property
we can write

(b(τ ), c(τ ), α)

(λ−1b(τ ), λc(τ ), λ−1α) .

(33)

Thus, in case the functional dependence on c(τ ) is much weaker than the one on b(τ ),
we have to increase the coupling constant when the total classical momentum transfer is
α−2, this is
increased in order to keep the ionization probability ﬁxed. Noting that E
expected from the classical point of view, since to free a more deeply bound state with
the same probability requires a larger momentum transfer. In the reversed case, in which
the functional dependence on c(τ ) is much stronger than the one on b(τ ) we have to
decrease the coupling constant when the total classical displacement is increased in order
to keep the ionization probability at the same value. Also this behaviour is expected
from a classical point of view, since when a less deeply bound state is freed with the
same probability, it will be further displaced.

The behaviour in ﬁgure 1 is therefore explained by relation (33). Note that in ﬁgure
1(b) the value of
(E0 = 0), which of course has to be zero, is a measure for the
poor quality of the zeroth order Gordon-Volkov perturbation theory, at least in this low
intensity regime. Finally it is worth to note that the crossover which takes place for the
curves of α = 1.5 and α = 2 indicates that in fact (33) is not exact and the pulse length
has to be scaled also. It is not an indication that the higher order terms need to be
taken into account, since, as we discussed in subsection 2.3, scale invariance holds order
by order in perturbation theory.

3 Existence criteria for stabilization

As a consequence of (21) it is elementary to derive a diﬀerential equation which has to
be satisﬁed by the ionization probability

As an example one may easily convince oneself that (23) indeed satisﬁes (34).

One way to speak of stabilization is when the ionization probability as a function of

the ﬁeld amplitude satisﬁes

existence of stabilization may be written alternatively as

Once again it will be instructive to verify this statement for an explicit example. We
believe that hitherto no analytical expression for the ionization probability is known
which obeys the strict inequality in (35). However, it was shown [17, 12] that in the
the equal sign holds. In particular when b(τ ) = c(τ ) = 0
extreme intensity limit E0 → ∞
one obtains non-trivial expressions in this case. Taking for instance the potential to be
the δ-potential in three dimensions, the ionization probability of the only bound state
was computed to [17]

It is interesting to note that for potentials which do not possess an energy scale, like
) on
the ones mentioned after (10), relation (36) reduces to ∂
a ﬁnite interval. This means that for increasing pulse length the ionization probability
should decrease, which is as counterintuitive as the statement (35).

4 Conclusions

P

We have shown that transforming the length scale corresponds to a symmetry in the
(ϕ). We demonstrated that this symmetry property may be
ionization probability
used as a consistency check in various approximation methods in numerical or analytical
form. One should also note that every numerical code which fully solves the Schr¨odinger
equation can be tested for consistency by appropriately scaling all variables. Moreover
one can employ the scale invariance to avoid certain problems which sometimes plague
numerical calculations as for instance the occurrence of very small numbers near machine
precision or of very large numbers. By re-scaling all parameters one might be able to
avoid such diﬃculties and still describe exactly the same physical situation.

We have further shown, in section 2.6, that certain types of behaviour for which one
has very often intuitive physical explanations may be conﬁrmed by means of scaling
arguments.

We like to stress that none of the above considerations is restricted to a particular
intensity regime of the pulse in comparison with the potential and they hold for low
as well as ultra high intensities, although the latter regime is of course currently of
more interest. The above considerations may of course be carried out also for other
, harmonic spectra etc. It follows for instance
quantities of interest like ionization rates
immediately that the ionization rate has to scale inverse to the time, i.e.
.
Fermi’s golden rule scales for instance in this way.

As an outlook one should keep in mind that like in numerous other situations the
physics becomes more interesting when the symmetry is broken. For instance for the

10

two-dimensional delta potential we noted already that there is a priori no energy scale
available. However, these potentials suﬀer from ultraviolet divergencies at the origin
which have to be renormalised. Through this procedure one then introduces an addi-
tional scale, which is a situation reminiscent of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. Another
interesting situation arises when we have more than one intrinsical physical scale in our
system. In many situations one scale is dominating the other and the problem is re-
ducible to one with only one parameter. However, there might intriguing situations
in which the scales combine in an arbitrary complicated manner as for instance in a
statistical physics problem where we have a microscopic length scale which speciﬁes the
typical distance between ﬂuctuating magnetic degrees of freedom and the correlation
length.

We have calculated energy levels and lifetimes of 4f 7 and 4f 65d conﬁgurations of Gd IV us-
ing Hartree-Fock and conﬁguration interaction methods. This allows us to reduce signiﬁcantly
the uncertainty of the theoretical determination of the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) en-
hancement factor in this ion and, correspondingly, in gadolinium-containing garnets for which such
measurements were recently proposed. Our new value for the EDM enhancement factor of Gd+3 is
−2.2 ± 0.5. Calculations of energy levels and lifetimes for Eu III are used to control the accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

There have been recent suggestions by Lamoreaux
[1] and Hunter [2] for searches of the electron electric
dipole moment (EDM) in solid state experiments with
the compounds Gadolinium Gallium Garnet Gd3Ga5O12
and Gadolinium Iron Garnet Gd3Fe5O12.
It is known
that an EDM of a system in a stationary quantum state
violates both time-reversal (T) and space-reﬂection (P)
symmetries. This is why searches for EDMs of elemen-
tary particles, atoms, and molecules are very important
for studies of violations of fundamental symmetries [3].
The best limit on the electron EDM comes from the
Berkeley experiment of Regan et al. [4] with an atomic
Thallium beam, de < 1.6 × 10−27e cm. There are ideas
on how to improve the sensitivity substantially working
with PbO [5] and YbF [6] molecules. An alternative that
can provide a real breakthrough is to use solids contain-
ing uncompensated electron spins. This idea was already
suggested in 1968 by Shapiro [7]. Application of a strong
electric ﬁeld to electrons bound within a solid would align
the EDMs of the unpaired electrons. This should lead
to a simultaneous alignment of the electron spins; the
magnetic ﬁeld arising from this alignment could be de-
tected experimentally. Another possibility is to polar-
ize electrons by the external magnetic ﬁeld. This causes
alignment of electron EDMs, and hence induces a volt-
age across the sample that could be detected. An exper-
iment of this kind has been performed with nickel-zinc
ferrite [8], however, due to experimental limitations, the
result was not very impressive. Interest in this approach
has been renewed recently owing to the suggestions by
Lamoreaux [1], Hunter [2] to perform similar experiments

with Gadolinium Gallium Garnet and Gadolinium Iron
Garnet, employing new experimental techniques. The es-
timates of sensitivity presented in [1] look highly promis-
ing; an improvement by several orders of magnitude is
feasible.

The ﬁrst calculations of the expected eﬀects have been
performed in recent papers Buhmann et al. [9], Kuenzi
et al. [10] using a semiempirical approach. The com-
pounds under consideration contain Gd3+ ions, see
Ref. [11], that give the most important contributions to
the eﬀect owing to their large nuclear charge. Therefore,
from the theoretical point of view, the problem can be
split into two closely connected, but still distinct, parts.
The ﬁrst part is the evaluation of the EDM of a Gd3+
ion induced by an assumed electron EDM, and the sec-
ond part is an account of the combined electron-lattice
dynamics of the solid. It has been shown by Buhmann
et al. [9] that the main contribution to the Gd3+ EDM
comes from mixing between 4f and 5d electrons. This
mixing depends on the energy separation between 4f 7
and 4f 65d conﬁgurations. There are experimental data
on the relevant energy intervals [12]. However, Ref. [12]
does not contain identiﬁcation of all possible levels; there-
fore, one cannot rely completely on the data. It has been
pointed out by [9, 10] that accurate calculations of the
energy levels of the 4f 65d conﬁguration of Gd3+ ion are
the needed to improve the accuracy of the EDM calcula-
tion.

There were recent measurements of lifetimes of some
states of the 4f 65d conﬁguration of Eu III [13], which
has an electronic structure similar to Gd IV. Therefore,
calculations of lifetimes in Eu III provide a good test
of the accuracy of E1-transition amplitudes which deter-
mine both lifetimes and the EDM enhancement factor. In
the present work we perform calculations of the energy
levels and lifetimes of both Eu III and Gd IV.

II. CALCULATION OF ENERGIES

We use two diﬀerent sets of computer codes to do our
calculations. One is our own conﬁguration interaction
program and the second is a code written by Cowan [14]
and freely available via the Internet 1. We use both codes
to compute energy levels of Eu III and Gd IV. Calcula-
tions for the Eu III are mostly done to control the ac-
curacy. These two ions have similar electronic structure,
however, much of the reliable experimental data is avail-
able for Eu III while limited data are available for Gd IV.
We restrict our study to the lowest odd conﬁguration 4f 7
and even conﬁguration 4f 65d; these are the conﬁgura-
tions most relevant to the atomic EDM.

We will describe our approach in detail while restrict-
ing our comments on the Cowan code to few general re-
marks. Since our calculations are relativistic, we will use
the abbreviation RCI (relativistic conﬁguration interac-
tion) to refer to them. We start our calculations using the
relativistic Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Calculations of
the self-consistent ﬁeld are done for an ion in its ground
state. This is an open-shell system with 7 out of 14 elec-
trons in its outermost 4f subshell. Therefore, we apply
50% weighting to the contribution of the 4f subshell to
the HF potential. This weighting is further reduced to
∼ 46% when the interaction of a 4f electron with other
electrons of the same subshell is calculated (6/13 ≈ 0.46).
Note, that our calculations are relativistic and we apply
the same weighting to both 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 subshells.
RCI results for the 4f 65d conﬁguration are sensitive to
how the 5d state is calculated. It is natural to calculate
it in the ﬁeld of the 4f 6 subshell, which means that HF
potential is modiﬁed by removing a contribution of one
4f electron. However, the 5d state obtained in this way
is still not good enough to achieve accurate energy lev-
els. This is probably because the self-consistent ﬁeld is
calculated for the conﬁguration 4f 7 and not for 4f 65d.
Therefore, we further modify the 5d state by introducing
a correction to the HF potential in which this state is
calculated:

δV = −

α
2(a4 + r4)

.

(1)

Here α is polarizability of an ion in the 4f 6 conﬁguration,
a is a cut-oﬀ parameter introduced to remove the singu-
larity in the origin. Potential (1) describes the eﬀect of
core polarization by the ﬁeld of external electron. We
treat α as a ﬁtting parameter. Its value (α = 0.5a3
B) has
been chosen to obtain accurate energy levels for Eu III.
The value of a is not very important because the 5d wave
function is small at short distances. We use a = aB. We
use the same values of a and α for both Eu III and Gd IV.

for the RCI calculations are constructed by distributing
seven electrons over these states in all possible ways.
Then, many-electron states of deﬁnite parity and total
angular momentum J are constructed. The actual ma-
trix size depends on the conﬁguration considered and the
value of the total angular momentum J; it varies between
1 (4f 7, J = 25/2) and 377 (4f 65d, J = 9/2).

[15]).

Energy intervals in the RCI calculations are sensitive
to the value of Slater integrals (F2(4f, 4f ), F2(4f, 5d),
etc.).
In the HF approximation, the value of these in-
tegrals, and consequently the energy intervals, are over-
estimated. This is because of screening of the Coulomb
interaction between valence electrons by core electrons
(see, e.g.
In the present work we include this
screening semi-empirically by introducing screening fac-
tor f2 = 0.8. The value of this factor was chosen to ﬁt
energy intervals in Eu III. Thus, in the end, we have two
ﬁtting parameters, a core polarizability α and a screening
factor f2. The values of both of these factors are chosen
for Eu III and then the same values are used for Gd IV.
Calculations with the Cowan code are very similar to
the RCI calculations. This is also a conﬁguration interac-
tion method, although in its non-relativistic realization.
There are also two ﬁtting procedures in the Cowan code.
One is scaling of the Coulomb integrals by a factor of
0.85. This is very similar to our screening of Coulomb
interaction. Another ﬁtting which we use in the Cowan
code is changing “by hand” the average energy of the
ground state conﬁguration. This is equivalent to shifting
all energy intervals between the ground and excited con-
ﬁguration by the same value. A few more details about
calculations with the Cowan code will be given in Section
IV.

III. CALCULATION OF LIFETIMES

Lifetimes of the three 4f 65d 8P5/2,7/2,9/2 states of
Eu III have been recently measured by Zhiguo et al. [13].
Calculations using the Cowan code give values which are
about three times smaller (see Table I). It is important
to investigate the source of this discrepancy.

In a single-conﬁguration approximation which we use
in the present work, lifetimes of all states of the 4f 65d
conﬁguration are determined by single radial integral

R4f,5d =

R4f (r)R5d(r)r3dr,

∞

Z
0

and can be presented in a form

τi = Ai/R2

4f,5d,

where i denote a particular energy level. The parame-
ter Ai is sensitive to the mixing of states (correlations
between valence electrons) while there are also many-
body corrections to R4f,5d due to correlations between
valence and core electrons. Since the ratio of experimen-
tal and calculated lifetimes is almost the same for all

(2)

(3)

three 8P states (see Table I), it is natural to assume that
the most of discrepancy comes from many-body correc-
tions to R4f,5d. Note, that the ratio of the experimental
and calculated lifetimes is even more stable in the work
of Mashonkina et al. [16]. The ratio is 3.0 ± 0.3 and the
corresponding lifetimes are presented in column four of
Table I. Calculations in this work were also done with
the Cowan code, however the mixing of states was more
carefully considered.

In the HF approximation, R4f,5d = 0.77aB. Now we
calculate a correction to this value due to core polariza-
tion by the dipole electric ﬁeld of the emitted photon.
We do this in the random-phase approximation (RPA)
using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method (TDHF)
[17]. The TDHF equations can be written in a form

( ˆH0 − ǫi)δψi = −( ˆf + ˆδV )ψi,
where ˆH0 is HF Hamiltonian. The single-electron orbital
ψi satisﬁes HF equation

(4)

( ˆH0 − ǫi)ψi = 0,
ˆf is the operator of the external electric ﬁeld, δψi is a cor-
rection to the orbital ψi due to external ﬁeld ˆf , and ˆδV
is the modiﬁcation of the HF potential induced by cor-
rections to the core states. Equations (4) are solved self-
consistently for all core states. Note that since Eu III and
Gd IV are open-shell systems, the same weighting proce-
dure described in the previous section must be applied to
left-hand-side and right-hand-side of Eq. (4). The tran-
sition amplitude between states 4f and 5d in the RPA
is

h4f | ˆf + ˆδV |5di

(5)

(the HF approximation corresponds to ˆδV = 0). Core
polarization reduces the value of the R4f,5d radial integral
bringing lifetimes into better agreement with experiment
(see column “RPA” in Table I).

The remaining discrepancy should be attributed to cor-
relations. A detailed investigation of correlations leads
beyond the scope of the present work, but one should
note that correlations increase the density of the external
electron at short distances. Therefore, owing to normal-
ization, it must decrease the density at large distances,
thereby decreasing the value of the radial integral. Cal-
culated lifetimes are also sensitive to mixing of states.
Analysis of the RCI and Cowan code calculations shows
that the smallest mixing is for the 8P9/2 state. There-
fore, we can use this state to extract the value of R4f,5d
that ensures the best ﬁt of the experimental data. This
value is R4f,5d = 0.41aB for Eu+2. To calculate lifetimes
which correspond to the “best ﬁt” value of R4f,5d, one
need only multiply the results from the Cowan code by a
factor of 3.6. In summary, the values of R4f,5d for Eu III
and Gd IV are:

Eu III Gd IV
HF
0.77 aB 0.63 aB
RPA 0.56 aB 0.42 aB
Best ﬁt 0.41 aB 0.34 aB

IV. RESULTS

In Table II, we list and compare energies of 4f 7 and
4f 65d states in Eu III calculated using the RCI code
and the Cowan code. Energies are given relative to the
ground state 4f 7 8S7/2. As mentioned above, both codes
permit us to obtain results that are generally in good
agreement with experimental energies by scaling the elec-
trostatic Slater parameters to simulate correlation eﬀects
(Refs. [18, 19]). We use the scaling factor of 0.8 in RCI
code and 0.85 in the Cowan code. Also the energies of
the 4f 65d LSJ levels are shifted by 13500 cm−1 in the
Cowan code relative to the ground state 4f 7 8S7/2. In
the RCI code we don’t shift the energies but modify the
5d state as was described in Section II, to improve the en-
ergy interval between the 4f 7 and 4f 65d conﬁgurations.
In Table II, energies of the 4f 7 LSJ, 4f 65d LSJ, and
4f 66s LSJ levels in Eu III are compared with recom-
mended data from the National Institute for Standards
and Technology (NIST) by Martin et al. [20]. The 105
levels obtained from spectral analysis by Sugar and Spec-
tor [21] given in the NIST publication, classify about 300
of the observed lines. It should be noted that the spectral
analysis in [21] was based on the Cowan code, probably,
a simpler version than we use here.

It should be noted that we use diﬀerent coupling
schemes in RCI (jj coupling) and Cowan code (LS cou-
pling) to build energy matrices. We use, for convenience,
LS coupling labeling of states; however, neither jj nor
LS coupling can describe the physical states properly.
To combine together our results obtained with diﬀerent
coupling schemes, we calculated Land´e g-factors for each
level. For low-lying states, the g-factors are very close
to their non-relativistic values and identiﬁcation of levels
is easy. However, higher in the spectrum, strong mixing
between states makes level identiﬁcation diﬃcult. We re-
stricted our calculations to levels which are reliably iden-
tiﬁed in both calculations.

As can be seen from Table II that results of both calcu-
lations for Eu III are in good agreement with one another
and with experiment. This gives us conﬁdence in similar
calculations for Gd IV.

The RCI calculations for Gd IV are done in exactly
the same way as for Eu III. All ﬁtting parameters were
chosen for Eu III and no a priori data on Gd IV was

used in the calculations.
In a sense, we can say that
the Gd IV calculations are predictive. They produce an
energy spectrum of Gd IV regardless of what is known
about it. In contrast, the calculations with the Cowan
code are not exactly the same for both ions. While we
use the same scaling factor for Coulomb integrals (0.85)
the energy shift for the 4f 65d conﬁguration is larger for
Gd IV (18000 cm−1) than for Eu (13500 cm−1). A larger
energy shift is needed to obtain good agreement with
available experimental data.

In Table III, we compare energies of the 4f 7 LSJ and
4f 65d LSJ levels with available experimental data and
and predicted data given by Kielkopf and Crosswhite
It can be seen from Table III that for the 4f 7
[12].
conﬁguration the energies obtained by Cowan code EC
are in better agreement with energies from [12] than are
energies obtained by RCI code EM. However, for the
4f 65d conﬁguration, results of both calculations are in
very good agreement with each other and with [12].

In Tables (II and III), we present lifetimes of the
4f 65d LSJ levels calculated using the Cowan code with
the HF value of the R4f,5d radial integral. To get more
accurate predictions for the lifetimes one should multi-
ply the values presented in tables by the factor of 3.6
(see section I).

V. CONCLUSION

In a recent work on calculation of the EDM enhance-
ment factor (K) in Gd IV [9], the result was presented
in a form of two diﬀerent numbers: KA ≈ −6.4 and

4

KB ≈ −3.3. These two numbers were based on diﬀerent
assumptions about the energy splitting between 4f and
5d states of Gd IV. The ﬁrst number, (KA) corresponds
to E5d − E4f ≈ 40, 000 cm−1 which is a result of extrapo-
lation from Eu III. The second number (KB) corresponds
to E5d − E4f ≈ 100, 000 cm−1 which is based on avail-
able experimental data for Gd IV (too incomplete at that
time to be fully trusted).

The present work clearly indicates that the correct en-
ergy splitting is closer to 100, 000 cm−1 and consequently,
the enhancement factor is rather -3.3.

Furthermore, an analysis of lifetimes of Eu III suggests
that core polarization by the electric ﬁeld of an external
photon is an important eﬀect for both ions, Eu III and
Gd IV. It reduces the value of the R4f,5d radial integral
by a factor of about 1.5. This eﬀect was not included in
the calculation of the EDM enhancement factor (KEDM )
[9]. Only contributions proportional to the R4f,5d radial
integral were considered in that work. To include core
polarization by the electric ﬁeld, one should divide the
ﬁnal answer of Ref. [9] by the factor of 1.5. This leaves
us with KEDM = −2.2(−3.3/1.5).

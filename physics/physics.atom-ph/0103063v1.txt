We present experimental results on the two-body loss rates
in a magneto-optical trap of metastable helium atoms. Abso-
lute rates are measured in a systematic way for several laser
detunings ranging from -5 to -30 MHz and at diﬀerent inten-
sities, by monitoring the decay of the trap ﬂuorescence. The
dependence of the two-body loss rate coeﬃcient β on the ex-
cited state (23P2) and metastable state (23S1) populations is
also investigated. From these results we infer a rather uniform
rate constant Ksp = (1

Laser modiﬁed scattering and reactions

I. INTRODUCTION

Helium atoms in the metastable triplet state 23S1 (He*)
appear to be a good candidate for Bose-Einstein Condensa-
tion (BEC) according to theoretical predictions [1]. The cross
section for elastic collisions between spin-polarised metastable
helium atoms is expected to be large, allowing eﬃcient ther-
malization and evaporation in a magnetostatic trap, which
is the standard technique to reach BEC [2–5]. On the other
hand, very high autoionization rates (Penning collisions) pre-
vent reaching high densities of metastable helium atoms, both
in the presence and in the absence of light, unless the sample
is spin polarized.
If a metastable helium atom collide either with an other
metastable atom, or with an helium atom excited in the 23P2
state, the quasi molecule formed can autoionize according to
the following reactions:

He (23S1) + He (23S1)

He (11S0) + He+ + e−
He+

2 + e−

→ (cid:26)

He (23P2) + He (23S1)

He (11S0) + He+ + e−
He+

2 + e−

→ (cid:26)

A ﬁrst experiment at subthermal energy (E = 1.6 meV)
with the metastable helium system was performed by M¨uller
et al. [6], allowing the determination of the interaction poten-
tials. Using those potentials the rate βSS for the reactions
10 cm3/s, which
(1) has been calculated [7–9] to be a few 10−
agrees with measurements performed in Magneto-Optical
Traps (MOT) [10,7,11]. According to theoretical predictions
[1], the ionization rate corresponding to the reactions (1)
should be suppressed by four orders of magnitude in a magne-
tostatic trap. Spin polarization of the atoms and spin conser-
vation in the collisional process are the causes of this suppres-
sion, which makes the quest of BEC reasonable. Actually, a
reduction of more than a factor of 20 in the two-body loss rate

(1)

(2)

in an optically polarized sample was observed experimentally
[12].

→

In presence of light exciting the transition 23S1

23P2, the
reaction (2) is dominant. “Optical collisions” with metastable
helium atoms were measured to have surprisingly large cross
sections when compared with alkali systems [13]. The study
of optical collisions is of fundamental importance in order to
optimize the ﬁrst step towards BEC, consisting in pre-cooling
and trapping the atoms in a MOT. The goal is to transfer
a cloud as dense as possible in a magnetic trap, in order to
increase the elastic collision rate and start evaporation. The
experimental study of optical collisions is the subject of this
paper.

Several groups reported measurements of optical collisions
rates, by studying losses in the MOT at small detunings
35
[10,8,11] around
5 MHz and at large detunings [11] at
45 MHz. Measurements over a broad range of
MHz and
detunings, from
20 MHz, were reported in [14]
−
and the dependence of the loss rate on the intensity of the
MOT laser beams was investigated. In reference [7] a theo-
retical model for optical collisions is also proposed predicting
rates in good agreement with the measurements, but diﬀer-
ing by more than one order of magnitude with all the other
measurements previously quoted.

Our measurements are performed in a MOT loaded with
109 atoms, at a peak density of 1010 atoms/cm3. With respect
to previous works, we extend the measurements of the two-
body loss rate to a wider range of detunings and intensities
with a good precision, by measuring the number of atoms
and the size of the trap using absorption techniques. Also,
by measuring accurately the excited state population in each
trapping condition, we are able to interpret our data with a
simple model, expressing the two-body loss rate in terms of
the excited state population and of a rate constant Ksp, found
to be independent of the laser detuning and intensity.

Our experimental setup is described in section II, while in
section III we explain our detection system and we give the
working conditions and performance of our magneto-optical

cited state population for diﬀerent trapping conditions. The
results are given in section V, and the conclusions in section
VI.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

A beam of metastable helium atoms is generated by a con-
tinuous high voltage discharge in helium gas, cooled to liquid
nitrogen temperature. Radiation pressure on the metastable
beam allows one to increase its brightness, and to deﬂect it

1

10−

from the ground state helium beam [15]. The metastable
atoms are then decelerated by the Zeeman slowing technique
and loaded in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a quartz cell
10 torr. More details on the
at a background pressure of 5
×
experimental setup will be given in a forthcoming paper [16].
MOT parameters for optimal loading of the trap are listed
in table I. For the laser manipulation of the atoms, we use
the line at 1083 nm, connecting the metastable triplet state
23S1 to the radiative state 23P2. The saturation intensity Isat
for this transition is 0,16 mW/cm2 and the linewidth Γ/2π
is 1.6 MHz. Our laser system consists of a DBR laser diode
(SDL-6702-H1) in an extended cavity conﬁguration, injecting
a commercial Ytterbium doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (IRE-POLUS
Group). The diode is stabilized by saturation spectroscopy
at -240 MHz from resonance. At the ﬁber output we obtain
600 mW of power, in a TEM00 mode at the same frequency.
The estimated linewidth is around 300 kHz. All the frequen-
cies required for collimation, deﬂection, trapping and probing
are generated by acousto-optical modulators in a double pass
conﬁguration, while we use directly part of the ﬁber output
beam for slowing the atoms.

In order to fully characterize the cloud, we use a probe laser
beam on resonance, whose diameter is about 1 cm, which is
turned on 100 µs after the MOT ﬁeld and light beams have
been turned oﬀ. Our detection setup (see ﬁg. 1) allows dif-
ferent measurements. With the combination of λ/2 plates
and polarization beam splitter cubes, we can create either (i)
a progressive wave, circularly polarized, passing through the
atomic cloud towards a photodiode (PD1 in ﬁgure 1), giving
the total absorption by the atoms, or (ii) a stationary wave,
also circularly polarized, one arm of which is sent to a CCD
camera, allowing spatially resolved absorption pictures of the
cloud. A second photodiode (PD2 in ﬁgure 1) is used to col-
lect the cloud ﬂuorescence. We use the absorption photodiode
PD1 to measure N, the number of atoms in the steady state of
the MOT. The probe beam saturates the transition when the
incident power exceeds 10 mW (see ﬁg. 2). The maximum
absorbed power is then P = N hν Γ
2 . Our Watt-meter (Co-
herent lab-master) is calibrated to 3% accuracy and allows a
rectilinear calibration ﬁt of the photodiode voltage. We mea-
sure a maximum total absorption of 1 mW, corresponding to
109 atoms. We estimate the accuracy for the mea-
(1
surement of N to be about 10%.

We stress the fact that the case of He* diﬀers of that of
alkalis, for which the imaging method gives a direct measure-
ment of both the two-dimensional column density and the rms
sizes of the MOT, by absorption of a brief and low intensity
In the case of He*, the quantum
probe pulse (I
≪
3 at 1.083 µm) is too low
eﬃciency of the CCD camera (10−
to provide images with a suﬃcient signal to noise ratio. We
need instead to illuminate the atoms with a 200 µs pulse
whose intensity is about 0.1 mW/cm2 (I
Isat), and use a
moderate magniﬁcation of 1/5. Another diﬃculty with He*
occurs from the large recoil momentum ¯hk/m (9.2 cm/s) due
to the light mass of the atoms : the atoms are pushed out of
resonance during the 200 µs pulse if a traveling wave pulse is
used. The solution we adopted is to illuminate the atoms in a
standing wave with the set-up shown in ﬁgure 1. Though this
scheme allows us to obtain pictures with a good contrast, the
drawback is that the images obtained in the standing wave
conﬁguration for I
Isat are more diﬃcult to analyze than
in the low intensity case. In order to interpret the absorption
pictures in the standing wave conﬁguration, and for any sat-
uration parameter, we developed a handy theoretical model
(see appendix A) giving the column density of the atoms for
each pixel of the CCD camera. The resulting density is then
ﬁtted by a Gaussian curve to extract the size of the cloud.

∼

ﬂuorescence signal is proportional to the number of atoms, we
obtain a ﬂuorescence decay curve reproducing equation (6),
which we ﬁt to get the parameter βn(0, t0). In order to de-
termine β, one still has to measure n(0, t0), which means that
one has to measure the rms size of the cloud along the three
directions and the initial number of atoms N (t0).
Our goal is to measure the loss rate for a wide range of de-
tunings and intensities. The experimental procedure, divided
in three successive steps, is the following.
(1) First, we load the trap for 1 s at δ =
45 MHz and at the
highest intensity in the trapping beams (I/Isat=50 per laser
arm). Then, we stop the loading by blocking the slowing
beam with a mechanical shutter. 20 ms later, we “compress”
the MOT by suddenly changing its detuning and intensity
using acousto-optical modulators. We record the ﬂuorescence
signal during this procedure. A typical ﬂuorescence curve is
shown in ﬁgure 3.

FIG. 3. Evolution of the ﬂuorescence signal. Once the loading
is stopped, scattered light from the slowing beam is blocked, which
explains the drop of the signal at t=-10 ms. The detuning is then
set to δ = −20 MHz at t=0 ms and the ﬂuorescence decays.

The loading is stopped at t=-20 ms and the photodiode sig-
nal drops by a factor of 2 at t=-10 ms because the background
light from the slowing beam is blocked. The ﬂuorescence is
greatly enhanced in the beginning of the compression phase
at t=0 ms, as expected when the detuning is set closer to res-
onance (the detuning is set here to -20 MHz), but decays to
almost zero in about 100 ms because of the two-body losses.
Figure 4 shows the time evolution of the size of the cloud dur-
ing this phase of compression, showing that 10 ms are enough
to reach the new equilibrium size. Thus, we extract the pa-
rameter βn(0, t0) from a ﬁt of the ﬂuorescence decay starting
from t = t0 = 10 ms. At this very time we measure the sizes
of the MOT along x and y and the number of atoms in order
to calculate n(0, t0).

(2) Then, the sizes along the weak axis of the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient are measured by absorption on the CCD camera as
explained in section III. Figure 5 shows the rms size along x
for various laser detunings and intensities. The size along z
(strong axis of the quadrupole ﬁeld) is inferred from measure-
ments of the sizes along x and y with a magnetic ﬁeld gradient
b twice as large. We ﬁnd a typical size along z 20% smaller
than along the weak axes of the quadrupole. We did not cor-
rect the sizes for the expansion of the cloud during the pulse
lasting 200 µs, as this would have required the measurement
of the temperature for all the detunings and intensities. Nev-
ertheless, we performed some time of ﬂight measurements,
giving temperatures ranging from 0.3 mK at -10 MHz to 1
mK at -40 MHz, from which we estimate that the sizes are
overestimated at most by 5 % at -25 MHz and by 15 % at -5
MHz. In addition, we measured the statistical error on the
sizes to be relatively small at large detunings, 2 to 3%, but
larger at small detunings (about 10% at -5 MHz). This is due
(i) to the poor spatial resolution of our imaging system (pixel
130µm), and (ii) to a low signal to noise
dimension 80µm
ratio for small detunings where the loss rate is larger, as most
of the atoms are lost during the compression phase.

(3) Finally, to determine the number of atoms that were
still trapped at t0 = 10 ms, we simultaneously switch oﬀ the
magnetic ﬁeld and set the trapping beams on resonance at
t0, instead of letting the trap decay as in ﬁgure 3. The laser
intensity is set to a high enough value to strongly saturate the
transition. We get a peak of ﬂuorescence, whose amplitude is
proportional to the number of atoms. We compare it with the
peak obtained with the same procedure but for the MOT in
the best loading conditions of ﬁgure 2, for which we measured
the number of atoms precisely. From this comparison, we infer
the number of atoms at t = t0 in the compressed MOT, and
thus determine n(0, t0).
This measurement also gives access to the value of the average
population of the excited state πp. Indeed, πp is given by

where F is the ﬂuorescence signal we measure in the com-
pressed MOT at t0, and Fmax the ﬂuorescence signal at res-
onance, when the transition is saturated, and πp expected to
be 1/2.
Figure 6 shows the results of the ﬂuorescence measurements,
giving Fmax/F as a function of the inverse of the laser inten-
sity I for various detunings. It is interesting to note that the
inverse of F is found to vary linearly with the inverse of I.

Fig. 8 shows the loss parameter as a function of detuning
for a ﬁxed intensity ( I

Isat
increases when the detuning goes to zero, as the population
in the P state increases. Our results for β agree with previous
results [10,8,11,14] within the given error bars, extending the
measurements to a wider range of parameters. For example,
at -5 MHz and in an intensity range for which β is not ex-
pected to vary strongly (I = 140 to 200Isat), Kumakura et
8 cm3/s, Browaeys et al. [14]
al. [8] ﬁnd β = (4.2

Tol et al. [11] β = (1.3

β = (3.5
1.4)
also note that we ﬁnd neither a decrease of β for high intensi-
ties at small detunings, nor a decrease of β at small detunings
for a given intensity : this diﬀers from the results of [14]. In
fact, we ﬁnd that β increases with intensity at small detun-
ings, and also increases with decreasing detunings at a given
intensity. We also disagree with the results of [7] where much
smaller rates are found.
Finally, we also measured the loss rate in the trapping con-
45 MHz, I = 310Isat) : the decay rate of the
ditions (δ =
1 at a density
number of atoms was found to be βn(0) = 30s−
of 1010 at/cm3, which gives β = 3
One can further analyze these data following the simple model
of [10] which relates the decay constant β to the constant rate
coeﬃcients Kss, Ksp and Kpp and to the populations of the
excited and ground state levels, πp and πs respectively:

In ﬁgure 9, we then plot Ksp for the ensemble of our
data. We do not see clear evidence for a dependence of Ksp
with the detuning or the intensity within the dispersion of
our data. To a good approximation, we estimate then that
Ksp is actually constant in the explored range of parameters:
7 cm3/s, with a dispersion that roughly
Ksp = (1.0
agrees with the error bars we claim. This result agrees with
the ﬁrst measurement ever performed [10], but the precision
is now much improved. It also agrees well with the measure-
8
ments of [8] where the authors found Ksp = (8.3
10−
cm3/s, assuming that for their parameters (δ =
I = 30 mW/cm2), πs = πp = 0.5.
An important point is that, in contrast with the measure-
ment of the ﬂuorescence at resonance where the transition is
assumed to be saturated, πp in the compressed MOT never
reaches 0.5 in our measurements : even for the smallest de-
tuning and the highest intensity, πp is only 0.2. This explains
why the results for β in ﬁgure 7 at δ =
5 MHz strongly in-
crease for increasing intensity over the whole explored range.

We measured the absolute two-body loss rate between
metastable atoms in a magneto-optical trap as a function of
detuning and intensity. We extended the range of these pa-
rameters and compared the results to those of previous mea-
surements, mostly performed at small detunings. Using a new
experimental approach, we obtained reliable values for the
two-body loss rates with an improved accuracy as compared
to most earlier results. In the region of overlap of parame-
ters, we ﬁnd a good agreement with previous measurements,
within the quoted uncertainties. We ﬁnd a loss rate monotoni-
cally increasing as a function of intensity and decreasing with
detuning. Our measurements are interpreted with a simple
model, giving a rather constant loss rate Ksp, with an aver-
7 cm3/s, as already found in the
age value of (1
very ﬁrst measurement of [10]. We believe that the quality
and the extended range of our measurements should moti-
vate more theoretical work, in order to understand better the
peculiar dynamics of Penning collisions between metastable

APPENDIX A: MODEL OF THE ABSORPTION

In this appendix we describe the method we used to quan-
titatively interpret the absorption images of the atomic cloud
when a standing wave conﬁguration of the probe beam is used,
and for an arbitrary saturation parameter. We describe the
atoms as two-level atoms characterized by a non linear sus-
ceptibility:

where n(x, y, z) is the atomic density, d the atomic dipole, δ
the detuning, Γ the inverse lifetime of the excited state and
Ω is the Rabi frequency given by

E =

(A2)

E

where E is the electric ﬁeld. The direction of propagation of
the beam is z and the ﬁeld is supposed to be uniform in the
plane (x,y). The propagation of the ﬁeld is then described by
the Maxwell equations:

∆ + k2

0 (1 + χ)

Ω(z) = 0

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(A3)

where k0 is the wavevector of the light.
The principle of the model is to use the slowly varying en-
velope approximation generalized to the case of a standing
wave. We then decompose the probe beam ﬁeld as:

Ω(z) = A+(z) eik0z + A

(z) e−

ik0z

(A4)

−

where A+, A
are the slowly varying envelopes of the wave
going towards positive z and negative z respectively. A simi-
lar decomposition holds for the nonlinar susceptibility of the
atoms:

χ(z) = χ0(z) + χ+(z) e2ik0z + χ

(z) e−

2ik0z + . . .

where χ0, χ+ and χ
are slowly varying envelopes, and where
we neglect terms in the expansion describing generation of
frequencies others than the probe frequency via the non linear
interaction.
If we insert the expansions (A4) and (A5) into the propagation
equation (A3) and use the rotating wave appoximation, we
obtain a set of two coupled diﬀerential equations for the slowly
. By splitting the complex
varying ﬁeld amplitudes A+, A

For δ = 0 and in the limit of small saturation parameters,
one has α = 1, f0
0 and one recovers the usual
≃
decoupled equation for low saturation absorption. We have
now to solve equations (A16) and (A17). More precisely we
wish to calculate the column density

for each eﬀective pixel (x,y) of our image of the cloud. For
each eﬀective pixel, we can measure the initial conditions:

corresponding respectively to the intensity of the probe beam
before passing through the cloud, or equivalently without the
atoms, and to the intensity of the probe beam that passed
through the atomic cloud. For symmetry reasons, the column
density (A19) is given by 2Z0 = Z(0), where Z0 veriﬁes

For each pixel (x,y), we then integrate equations (A16)-(A17)
numerically using the initial conditions (A20)-(A21) until
˜A+(Z)

|
|
gives the column density. Note that, contrarily to what hap-
pens in the low saturation regime, we here need the values Ii
and If separately (and not only their ratio), which implies a
calibration of our CCD camera.

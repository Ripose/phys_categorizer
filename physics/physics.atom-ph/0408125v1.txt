Abstract. Collisions between tightly conﬁned atoms can lead to ionization and hence
to loss of atoms from the trap. We develop second-order perturbation theory for
a tensorial perturbation of a spherically symmetric system and the theory is then
applied to processes mediated by the spin-dipole interaction. Redistribution and loss
mechanisms are studied for the case of spin-polarized metastable helium atoms and
results obtained for the ﬁve lowest s states in the trap and trapping frequencies ranging
from 1 kHz to 10 MHz.

Collisional loss of atoms from harmonic traps

1. Introduction

There is signiﬁcant interest in the study and control of quantum processes involving
trapped ultracold neutral atoms where the trapping environments are so tight that
the eﬀect of the trapping ﬁelds upon the colliding atoms cannot be ignored or
approximated as constant background ﬁelds. Trapping in three-dimensional optical
lattices, with typical trapping frequencies of 104 to 106 Hz, forms the basis of such
studies as quantum phase transitions of 87Rb atoms [1], storage of metastable argon
atoms [2], implementation of quantum logic gates and formation of highly entangled
quantum states [3, 4]. Theoretical
investigations have focussed mainly on tightly
conﬁned alkali systems and have been based either upon direct numerical integration
of the radial Schr¨odinger equation for the relative motion of the colliding atoms using
the best available full interatomic potentials [5] or upon a regularized delta-function
pseudopotential and an energy-dependent eﬀective scattering length [6, 7].

An understanding of collision processes in trapped ultracold metastable 23S helium
(denoted by He∗) is necessary to obtain Bose-Einstein condensation of this species [8, 9]
and to investigate these novel excited-state condensates [10, 11]. Although current
experiments on He∗ only use trapping frequencies of the order of 102 to 103 Hz, it is of
interest to investigate the eﬀects of much tighter trapping on the allowed quantized trap
states, as a possible tool to manipulate the conﬁned atoms, and to enhance trap loss
through ionization processes at small interatomic separations as a means of studying
these processes.

We have recently analyzed a system of two colliding ultracold atoms under strong
harmonic conﬁnement in a spherically symmetric trap from the viewpoints of quantum
defect theory and of elastic scattering in the interatomic potential. We have developed
methods for determining the energies of the quantized states produced by the presence
of the trap and the theory was applied to collisions between spin-polarized He∗ atoms,
see Peach et al [12, 13]. The energies were determined for a wide range of trapping
frequencies for s- and d- wave collisions using two totally independent methods to
integrate the radial Sch¨odinger equation. Excellent agreement was obtained between
the two methods, one based on the use of quantum defect theory and the second on the
use of a discrete variable representation.

These calculations ignored loss processes, but inelastic collisions may cause
transitions to states from which there is a high probability of Penning and associative
ionization. A study of such loss processes is the subject of this paper which is organized
as follows. In section 2, the theory of collisions in an isotropic trap is brieﬂy reviewed,
and in section 3, second-order perturbation theory is introduced for a general form of
the perturbation and for trap states of any angular momentum. In section 4, the theory
is applied to perturbation by the spin-dipole interaction and in section 5 the numerical
methods are described. Finally in section 6 the theory is applied to the case of spin-
polarized He∗ atoms. It is found that only the s states are signiﬁcantly perturbed and
shifts and lifetimes are presented for the ﬁve lowest s states in the trap for trapping

Consider two atoms with masses M1 and M2, spin quantum numbers S1 and S2 and
position vectors r1 and r2 relative to the centre of the trap. The interatomic separation
is given by r =
and, for the case of an atom-atom potential that is only
a function of r combined with a potential for an isotropic harmonic trap of angular
frequency ω, the Hamiltonian is separable into two parts Hcm and H0 describing the
centre-of-mass and relative motions of the two atoms. Here we will use and extend the
notation developed in [13]. If the total spin quantum number is S and the adiabatic
potential for the molecular state 2S+1Λ is denoted by VΛS(r), the equation for the relative
motion is

Initially the atoms are spin polarized so that S = 2 and MS = 2 and

In [13], it was shown that since the eﬀective range of the bound-state wave function is
typically 103a0 to 104a0, the wave function FklΛS for a trap state could be replaced by
a free-wave function of the same energy and an excellent value for the energy obtained.
Therefore in this application, the energy shifts and widths are calculated using both
bound-state (∆trap = 1) and free-wave solutions (∆trap = 0) of (4) for Fk002 to test
further the validity of the free-wave approximation. Energy shifts and widths are also
calculated for trap states with l = 2.

6. Numerical calculations

The unperturbed eigenvalue equation in the form (4) or (7) was solved using the two
computational methods described in [13]. The ﬁrst combines the use of quantum defect
theory, numerical integration and an iterative procedure (QDT) and in the second a
direct numerical solution is obtained using a discrete variable representation (DVR)
of the kinetic energy operator and a scaled radial coordinate grid. The DVR method
is easily modiﬁed to solve (20) for the perturbed functions GklΛS(ρ). A general real
invertible transformation of the radial variable ρ given by

t = u(ρ);

l′ (r) and dF R

Alternatively, having determined the values of n∗ for the bound states, (4) and (19)
are solved for the correct energies with ∆trap = 0. The previous numerical procedure
QDT can be readily modiﬁed for this purpose and equations (4) and (19) are integrated
numerically using the Numerov algorithm. The solution of (19) contains, in general, a
particular integral plus a complementary function which is some linear combination of
l′ (r) and F I
F R
l′(r) as deﬁned by (21) with lΛS replaced by l′Λ′S′. The method, to be
labelled as QDTF, is as follows. Equation (4) is integrated outwards from the origin
to some r = rmax and F R
l′ (r)/dr are obtained. On matching to solutions
that are asymptotically plane waves using methods similar to those described in [13],
we obtain δl′(k). Then F I
l′(r)/dr are calculated at r = rmax, c.f. (21), so
that (4) can be integrated inwards to obtain the irregular solution. Integration of (19)
requires some care in dealing with the multiples of F R
l′(r) that build up in
the Numerov integration in both the outward and inward directions. In the integration
of (19) outwards, multiples of F R
l′ (r) are removed at each integration step determined
so that the function at the current point is zero and this speciﬁes Gout(r). The function
Gin(r) is obtained by integrating inwards and a multiple of F I
l′(r) is subtracted at the end
to make the function zero at the innermost point. Finally, a multiple of F R
l′ (r) is added
to Gout(r) so that the solution matches Gin(r) at r
6a0 and this procedure is very
insensitive to the precise choice of matching point. This completes the speciﬁcation
of the solution Gk′l′Λ′S′(r) of the inhomogenous equation (19).
It is found that for
rmax = 1000a0 convergence in the evaluation of the radial integrals in (33) has been
obtained correct to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

7. Results and discussion

The scaled energy shifts and widths ∆n∗ for the ﬁve lowest trap states with l = 0 have
been calculated using the DVR method for trapping frequencies ν = ω/2π ranging from
1 kHz to 10 MHz. Calculations have also been carried out for frequencies 100 kHz, 1
MHz and 10 MHz using the QDTF approximation and the agreement with the DVR
results is very satisfactory. Diﬀerences for transitions to the S′ = 0 states range from
1%. For
3% for the lowest state to 0.4% for the highest, and at 10 MHz are always
transitions to the S′ = 2 state the diﬀerences are even less, they are
0.3% except
for the lowest state at 100 kHz where the diﬀerence is 2%. It is clear why the QDTF
approximation is not so good for the lowest states as the range of r over which the
bound-state wave function can be approximated closely by a free wave decreases with
decreasing energy. The QDTF approximation has also been used in (26) to investigate
widths and shifts for l = 2 and they prove to be negligible. This is not surprising as
the perturbation weights the inner region strongly where the initial wave functions with
l

= 0 are very small.

The results shown in table 1 have been obtained using the DVR method. The
contributions to ∆n∗ of the terms with S′ = 0, 2 in (33) are also shown, together with
the eﬀective quantum number n∗ and the lifetime τ given by

τ =

1/(4πν

∆n∗) .

−

ℑ

The contributions from S′ = 0 are sensitive to the form used for Γ00(r). In table 1 we
also show lifetimes obtained using both ΓM(r) and ΓGMS(r). The energy shifts increase
with trapping frequency and n∗, but the fractional shifts ∆n∗/n∗ decrease with n∗ and
are of the order 10−5 to 10−7. The energy shift arises predominantly from the transitions
to S′ = 2 states. As expected, the lifetimes τGMS are shorter than the τM, as ΓGMS(r)
is larger than ΓM(r) for all r
5a0. This dependence suggests that an experimental
study of lifetimes as a function of trap frequency could yield an improved knowledge of
the potential representing the decay channel.

≤

The decay widths and lifetimes depend strongly on trapping frequency and the
lifetimes range from the order of 104 s for 1 kHz traps to the order of 15 ms for 10
MHz traps. The lifetimes for the lower frequencies are greater than both the metastable
helium lifetime of 8000 s and the typical lifetimes of experimental traps which are of the
order of seconds [2]. Over the range of frequencies investigated the real and imaginary
parts of ∆n∗ can be quite closely ﬁtted to the analytic form

∆n∗ =

A√x/(1 + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3) ;

x = νn∗ ,

and the parametric ﬁt to the lifetimes is then directly obtained from (40), (41) and (43).
In conclusion, second-order perturbation theory with a rather general form for the
perturbation and valid for states with non-zero angular momentum has been developed
here. These results are important and have been obtained so that the analysis can be
directly applied to other perturbations in future.

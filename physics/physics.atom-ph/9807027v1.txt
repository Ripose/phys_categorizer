In view of ongoing experiments to trap ultracold spin-polarized 6Li, we study various properties of
an interacting Fermi gas in a harmonic trap taking the discrete nature of the unperturbed harmonic
trap levels into account exactly. As 6Li has a rather large and negative scattering length, we focus on
the eﬀects of the attractive atom-atom interaction on several thermodynamic properties and on the
momentum and density distributions. The dependence of the chemical potential, the speciﬁc heat
and the density and momentum distributions on the number of particles in the trap is obtained. We
also calculate the energy of the gas. Comparison is made with results of a semiclassical calculation
and with the properties of a non-interacting gas. We ﬁnd that the eﬀect of the interactions is
rather large for realistic trap frequencies. Hence, it is important to include these interactions in any
quantitative predictions relevant for experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

≃ −

Recently there has been a lot of interest in the properties of trapped ultra-cold atoms. This interest has largely been
sparked by the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in the Bosonic systems 87Rb, 7Li, and 23Na [1–3]. Several
theoretical studies of trapped degenerate Fermi gases have been presented in addition to those on Bose systems. It
has even been shown that a two-component gas of spin-polarized atomic 6Li becomes superﬂuid at experimentally
obtainable densities and temperatures [4]. This is due to the fact that 6Li has an anomalously large and negative
s-wave scattering length a, with a recent measurement giving a
2160a0 where a0 is the Bohr radius [5]. s-wave
scattering is forbidden for two fermions in the same spin-state, but, the 6Li atom has six hyperﬁne states. This means
that by trapping 6Li in two diﬀerent hyperﬁne states, one can observe the relatively strong interactions due to s-wave
scattering between atoms in diﬀerent states. The trapping can be achieved since the energy of the hyperﬁne states
depend on the external magnetic ﬁeld. The highest three states “prefer” a lower magnetic ﬁeld and can therefore be
trapped in a static magnetic trap. In particular, one can trap the two highest states as proposed by Houbiers et al [6].
. In such a two-component gas of trapped spin-polarized 6Li atoms,
These two states will here be labeled
there will only be, to a good approximation, interactions between atoms in diﬀerent hyperﬁne states, whereas there
will be almost no interaction between atoms in the same state. Indeed, it was for such a two-component system that
the relatively high transition temperature Tc for a BCS-type phase transition was predicted [4].

The purpose of this paper is to examine the normal state properties of such a trapped gas of 6Li atoms with
components in the two highest hyperﬁne states. It is clearly necessary to understand these properties in the path
to achieving the predicted BCS-type transition. The normal state properties of a non-interacting trapped cloud of
fermions have been treated within the semiclassical Thomas-Fermi approximation [7] and also by taking the discrete
nature of the trap energy levels in the non-interacting limit into account [8]. As the interactions between 6Li atoms
in two diﬀerent hyperﬁne states are relatively strong, it is important to include the eﬀect of these interactions in any
realistic treatment of the system. Hence, the present paper extends the analysis of Refs. [7,8] by including both the
discrete nature of the trap levels as well as the eﬀects of the interactions (in the mean-ﬁeld approximation).

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we set up the formalism needed to treat an interacting two-component
system of fermions within the mean-ﬁeld approximation. We then, in Sec. III, analyze the inﬂuence of the trap
potential and the interactions on the chemical potential of the gas. We show, that the interactions have two distinct
eﬀects on the chemical potential: they lower its value below the non-interacting value and smooth out the steplike
features predicted by Schneider and Wallis [8]. The quasiparticle energy spectra and wave functions are considered in
Sec. IV and in Sec. V we investigate the behaviour of the energy and the heat capacity. We ﬁnd that at suﬃciently
low temperatures the interactions change the qualitative behaviour of the heat capacity. This is explained in terms
of the eﬀect the interactions have on the quasiparticle spectrum. In Sec. VI we discuss the density and momentum
distribution and their deviations from the non-interacting case and from the Thomas-Fermi predictions. Finally, we
summarize the results in Sec. VII.

II. FORMALISM

We consider a dilute gas of interacting 6Li atoms in two hyperﬁne states trapped in an external potential U0(r). As
the gas is dilute the interactions mainly happen through two-body collisions. Furthermore, since the s-wave scattering
length is much larger than the p-wave scattering length we can neglect any interaction between fermions in the same
hyperﬁne state. The gas is then described by the Hamiltonian:

ω is taken to be the same for each hyperﬁne state. We have assumed that number of particles N in each state is
the same such that we only have one chemical potential µ. As the critical temperature for a BCS type transition is
maximum when the number of particles in the two hyperﬁne levels is equal [4,6], we expect this conﬁguration to have
the most experimental relevance. The non-interacting case is achieved by setting g = 0; this limit has been treated by
Butts and Rokhsar within the Thomas-Fermi approximation [7] and by Schneider and Wallis [8] taking the quantizing
eﬀect of the trap potential into account. In this paper, we are interested in the eﬀect of the interactions on the normal
state properties of the gas. We can, therefore, ignore any pairing correlations leading to a BCS type transition and
use the following mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian:

As the negative scattering length introduces an attractive interatomic potential, the system can collapse to a ﬂuid or
solid state when the density of particles becomes too large. This eﬀect has been examined by Houbiers et al. [6] within
the semiclassical Thomas-Fermi approximation. For a trap with an equal number of particles in each hyperﬁne state
they ﬁnd, that the spinoidal point is given by N 1/6
¯h/ωm being the trap length. Numerically,
this transition is seen from the fact that there is no self-consistent solution to Eq. (4)-(5) when the chemical potential
is too high for a given coupling strength. The density of particles increases for each iteration without bound indicating
that the system is collapsing into a new dense phase. We ﬁnd that this problem arises in the region of parameters

We shall compare some of our results obtained from the solution of Eq. (4)-(5) with approximate results based on
the Thomas-Fermi approximation. This approximation essentially treats the trap potential as being locally constant.

III. THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL

≪

In this section we will determine the chemical potential µ as a function of the number of particles in the trap.
Schneider and Wallis [8] have done an extensive analysis of µ(N ) in the case of a non-interacting gas. They found
some remarkable steplike features in µ(N ) as compared to the Thomas-Fermi approximation; these steps were due
to the shell structure of the energy spectrum of an isotropic harmonic trap. They did, however, predict that for a
real Fermi gas, the interactions would tend to smooth out the steps. Using the formalism outlined above, we are now
able to examine in detail how the interactions aﬀect these steplike features. In Fig. (1) we have plotted the chemical
potential µ as a function of the number of particles N in a single hyperﬁne state for various coupling strengths g for
a very low temperature (kBT
¯hω). These curves were obtained by solving Eq. (4)-(5) for varying µ and g. The
dashed lines correspond to the Thomas-Fermi approximation obtained from the solution of Eq. (7)-(8). In Fig. (1)
(a) we have compared µ(N ) for the rather large coupling strengths g′ = 1 and g′ = 2 with the g = 0 case when there
g/(¯hωl3). As
are relatively few particles in the trap in order to highlight the steplike features. We have deﬁned g′
can be seen, that the interaction has two eﬀects. First of all, it lowers the value of the chemical potential for a given
number of particles N as compared to the g = 0 case. This is as expected, since the mutual attraction between the
particles in the two hyperﬁne states lowers the energy of the gas. Secondly, we note that the step like features of µ(N )
are smoothed out by the interaction. For g′ = 1 the step like features survive up to N <
2000 and for g′ = 2 they

being the s-wave scattering length for 6Li, g′ = 0.4 corresponds to a trap frequency of ν = ω/2π = 144Hz and g′ = 0.2
to a trap frequency of ν = ω/2π = 288Hz. These values are close to the ones used in the Bose-Einstein condensation
experiments at JILA [10] and at MIT [11] respectively. We again see the same behaviour as in Fig. (1) (a). The step

IV. THE ENERGY SPECTRUM

◦

. For comparison the symbols

From Fig (1) we see, that the step like features survive even though the value of µ(N ) is several ¯hω lower than
the g = 0 prediction. This is somewhat surprising as the steps are associated with the gaps of size ¯hω in the
g = 0 spectrum. One might expect these gaps to disappear once the levels are lowered by more than ¯hω due to the
interactions. To examine this eﬀect, we have in Fig. (2) plotted the quasiparticle spectrum for g′ = 2 for a very low
temperature for each angular momentum l. In Fig. (2) (a) the chemical potential is µ/¯hω = 8 whereas µ/¯hω = 13 in
Fig. (2) (b). The x-axis denotes the angular momentum l of the quasiparticle states and the quasiparticle energies
are marked by the symbol
denote the non-interacting quasiparticle energies. The
chemical potential is indicated by a thin dotted line. In the non-interacting case (g = 0), the energy spectrum is given
by Eν = (ν + 3/2)¯hω with ν = 0, 1, 2 . . .. The degeneracy of each level is Dν = (ν + 1)(ν + 2)/2 corresponding to the
angular momentum l being l = 0, 2, . . . ν for ν even and l = 1, 3, . . . ν for ν odd. This degeneracy in l gives rise to the
shell structure of the spectrum which is indicated in Fig. (2) by horizontal dashed lines. In the interacting case, the
energy Eν
in general depends on both ν and l. From Fig. (2) (a) (µ = 8¯hω) we see, that the quasiparticle energies in
l
the interacting case are lowered several ¯hω as compared to the normal state energies; e.g. the lowest energy is
1.7¯hω
for g′ = 2 as compared to 1.5¯hω for g′ = 0. However, from the solid lines in Fig. (2) (a) we see, that the energies
still depend only weakly on the angular momentum l. This means that the Hartree potential lowers the energy of the
l = ν state by almost the same amount as it lowers the l = 0 (ν even) or l = 1 (ν odd) state. This is not a priori
obvious as the wave functions for those two states are completely diﬀerent. This is shown in Fig. (3) where the solid
lines denote the quasiparticle wave functions uν=8
l=8 (r) (b) for µ = 8¯hω and g′ = 2. These states have
l=0 = 8.2¯hω and Eν=8
the energies Eν=8
l=8 = 8.4¯hω respectively. The l = 0 wave function is spread out from r = 0 to
2En/mω2 = 4l whereas the l = ν wave function is peaked around r
2.8l. Hence one might expect
r
rclass =
that the Hartree potential, which is also plotted as a solid line in Fig. (3) (c), would aﬀect the quasiparticle states
completely diﬀerently. But in fact, the lowering of the two energies as compared to the g = 0 case is approximately
the same. This explains the fact depicted in Fig. (1) that even though the chemical potential is several ¯hω below
the g = 0 prediction, µ(N ) still exhibits the step like features. The reason is, that even though each quasiparticle
energy is lowered several ¯hω due to the interaction, there is still an approximate l-degeneracy: there are still bands
separated in energy by
¯hω in the energy spectrum as a function of l. These bands (shell structure) give, as in the
g = 0 case, rise to the steplike structure of µ(N ). For comparison, we have also in Fig. (3) plotted the non-interacting
wave functions as dashed lines. As expected, we see that the eﬀect of the interactions is to compress the quasiparticle
states closer to the center of the trap where the Hartree ﬁeld is large. The cloud of particles is compressed as will
also be seen from the density distributions plotted in Sec. (VI). We can qualitatively understand the slight increase
in energy with increasing l as seen from the solid lines in Fig. (2) (a). The low angular momentum functions have a
larger amplitude in the center of the trap and are thus more aﬀected by the Hartree ﬁeld than the high l states.

Contrary to the µ = 8¯hω case, we see from the solid lines in Fig. (2) (b), that when µ = 13¯hω the approximate
independence of the quasiparticle energies on l no longer holds. The Hartree ﬁeld is now so strong that it has washed
out the shell structure of the spectrum and it is qualitatively diﬀerent from the g = 0 case. The energies now increase
13 and g′ = 2 the steplike features
signiﬁcantly with increasing l. This explains the fact from Fig. (1) (a), that for µ

For a gas of particles in a constant conﬁning potential, the most useful deﬁnition of the heat capacity is [12] is

the non-interacting case the total energy for particles in both hyperﬁne states is given by

When the number of particles is such that a ﬁnite number of energy levels up to and including the level EνF are
completely ﬁlled for T = 0 (i.e. N = 1, 4, 10, 20, . . . for νF = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . .), the low temperature chemical potential for
a constant number of particles is given by

It is interesting to examine how the interactions change this result. In Fig. (4) we have plotted the energy per
particle E′/2N of the interacting gas as a function of temperature T ′
E/¯hω and the energy is
given by Eq. (6). We have used the parameters g′ = 0.4, N = 5456 (a) and g′ = 0.4, N = 43680 (b). For comparison
we have also plotted the g = 0 results as dashed lines in Fig. (4) (c)-(d). As can be seen the interactions for both set
of parameters have lowered the total energy of the gas considerably. This is as expected as we from Fig. (1) see, that
the chemical potential in both cases is signiﬁcantly lower than the g = 0 result. Fig. (5) depicts the corresponding
heat capacity as a function of the temperature for N = 5456 (a) and N = 43680 (b) (solid lines). The dashed lines are
the g = 0 results and the dash-dotted line is the Thomas-Fermi result for g′ = 0 as given by Eq. (12). For N = 5456
(Fig. (5) (a)) we see, that the heat capacity for the interating system is still exponentially suppressed for kBT
¯hω.
For very low T the heat capacity is practically zero as for the g = 0 case and the interactions have not changed the
qualitative behaviour of the heat capacity. This is a direct result of the fact that the interactions have not changed
the shell structure of the energy spectrum. This can be seen from Fig. (1) (b)) where the step like features of µ(N )
are still prevailing for g′ = 0.4 and N = 5456.

≪

≡

≡

The break-down of this eﬀect is shown in Fig. (5) (b). We see that for N = 43680 the interactions have now
increased heat capacity substantially over the non-interacting result for low temperatures. It has the same order of
magnitude as the Thomas-Fermi prediction and it is qualitatively diﬀerent from the non-interacting case. This is due
to the fact that for this set of parameters the interactions have washed out the shell structure in the energy spectrum
(the l-degeneracy) as can be seen from Fig. (1), where the steplike features are smoothed out for N = 43680 and
g′ = 0.4. There are no gaps of ¯hω in the spectrum and hence no exponential damping factor in the heat capacity.

It should be noted that for very low temperatures the possibility of a transition to a superﬂuid state arises [4].
From the well known result of weak coupling superconductors, we expect that this transition will give rise to a kink
in the E(T ) curve as the energy per particle is lowered as compared to the normal state [13]. From this kink, we
obtain a discontinuity in CN (T ) at the transition temperature Tc. We will not in this paper consider this eﬀect as
we are concentrating on the normal state behaviour. Work is under progress to examine for which temperatures and
densities this transition takes place and how it can be determined experimentally.

We conclude, that the interactions in general lower the total energy as one would expect. The eﬀect of the interaction
on the heat capacity depends on the strength of the interactions and on the number of particles in the system. When
few particles are in the system or when the interaction is so weak that the shell structure of the energy spectrum is
intact, the heat capacity is still exponentially suppressed for low temperatures. The heat capacity can be suppressed
although the total energy of the system is signiﬁcantly lower than for the non-interacting case. This is, of course,
a consequence of the fact that the lowering of the quasiparticle energies and the washing out of the shell structure
happen at diﬀerent set of parameters g and N as explained in Sec. III-IV. Once the interactions are strong enough to
wash out the shell structure around the chemical potential, the behaviour of the heat capacity changes qualitatively.
It is no longer suppressed and has the same order of magnitude as the Thomas-Fermi prediction. The transition
between those two limiting behaviours is smooth as a function of N or g.

VI. DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS

In this section we will present results for the density and momentum distributions.

In an isotropic trap, these
distributions will be spherically symmetric when the gas is in the ground state. The density distribution ρ(r) is
calculated from ρ(r) =
U (r)/g with U (r) given by Eq. (5). In Fig. (6), ρ(r/l) is displayed for N = 120, 165 and
g′ = 2. For comparison we have also plotted the distributions for g′ = 0. The dashed curves are the Thomas-Fermi
results obtained from the solution of Eq. (7)-(8) with a given N . The temperature is taken to be zero. As can be
seen, ρ(r/l) is substantially changed due to the interactions. The cloud of particles is compressed as compared to the
non-interacting result due to the attractive forces. As a high density of particles increases the critical temperature for
a BCS-type transition, this eﬀect favours the formation of the superﬂuid state [4]. Furthermore, we observe a central

−

5

minimum for N = 120 and a central peak for N = 165 for both g′ = 2 and g′ = 0 as compared to the Thomas-Fermi
predictions. For the g′ = 0, this is because N = 165 corresponds to a ﬁlled shell with νF = 8, N = 120 corresponds
to a ﬁlled shell with νF = 7 and the fact that shells with ν = odd do not contribute to ρ(0) as they have odd angular
momentum [8]. We see that the interacting system exhibit the same qualitative dependence of ρ(0) for this set of
parameters, even though the actual densities are substationally diﬀerent from their g′ = 0 counterparts. This is due
to the fact, that for this set of parameters, the shell structure of the quasiparticle spectrum is still intact although the
actual energies and wave functions are changed substantially. This can be seen from Fig. (1) (a) where the step like
features still prevail for this set of parameters. Thus, even for g′ = 2, N = 165 still corresponds a highest shell of even
angular momentum states totally ﬁlled whereas N = 120 corresponds a ﬁlled highest shell of odd angular momentum
states. For a larger number of particles, where the shell structure of the quasiparticle spectrum has been washed out,
it turns out that this behaviour of ρ(0) has disappeared as expected. Also, a non-vanishing temperature will tend to
wash out the predicted dip/top behaviour of the density as the transition from occupied to unoccupied shells as a
function of energy becomes less abrupt.

The momentum distribution of the particles is not completely straightforward to measure. A simple free expansion
experiment where one switches oﬀ the trap potential non-adiabatically does not strictly measure this distribution.
The reason is, that the gas does not expand freely; collisions between particles in diﬀerent hyperﬁne states will alter
the momentum distribution. One would need a time-dependent formalism [14] in order to treat such an expansion
rigorously. However, we will here assume that the momentum distribution in the trapped state gives a good indication
of the distribution measured in such a free expansion experiment. The spherically symmetric momentum distribution

where Jl+1/2(x) is the ordinary Bessel function. In Fig. (7), we have plotted the momentum distribution for N = 43680
and g′ = 0.4. The momentum is measured in units of l−1. The dashed curve is the non-interacting result. For this
high number of particles, the shell structure of the quasiparticle spectrum is washed out and the distributions are,
apart from a small shell around the edge of the cloud, almost identical to the Thomas-Fermi prediction (not plotted).
We see that the interactions have spread out the distribution considerably as compared to the non-interacting case. As
the Hartree ﬁeld lowers the quasiparticle energies more levels become occupied in the center of the trap. The higher
momentum states thus become populated leading to a spreading out of the momentum distribution as compared to
the g′ = 0 case.

We conclude that the interactions in general alter both the momentum distribution and the density distribution
substantially. The density distribution is compressed and the momentum distribution spread out as compared to the
non-interacting results. Furthermore, the central minima and maxima of ρ(r) as a function of N can still be observed,
when the interactions have not yet washed out the shell structure of the quasiparticle spectrum.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have considered a trapped spin-polarized gas of interacting fermions. We ﬁnd that the interactions
have two distinct eﬀects on the quasiparticle spectrum. It lowers the quasiparticle energies and thus the total energy
of the gas. Also, above a certain number of particles in the trap, it washes out the shell like structure of the spectrum
associated with a harmonic trap. These two eﬀects are independent, in the sense that the energy of the gas can be
lowered considerably as compared to the non-interacting case, but the shell structure of the spectrum is left relatively
intact. One can still, therefore, observe eﬀects such as step like features in the chemical potential, exponential
damping of the low temperature heat capacity and maxima and minima in ρ(0) associated with a non-interacting
¯hω is experimentally feasible.
gas. Whether these eﬀects will be observable depend on whether the condition kBT
The interactions are also found to compress the atom cloud and spread out the momentum distribution considerably.
This eﬀect should be readily observable; it is important to include in any realistic calculation of the properties of
spin-polarized 6Li in a trap.

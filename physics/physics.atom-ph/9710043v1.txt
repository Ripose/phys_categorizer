We analyze several models of atomic detectors in the
context of the measurement of coherence properties of
matter waves. In particular, we show that an ionization
scheme measures normally-ordered correlation functions
of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld, in analogy with the optical sit-
uation. However, it exhibits a sensitivity to exchange
processes that is normally absent in optics.

Optical coherence theory is based on the observa-
tion that most quantum measurements that can be
performed on the electromagnetic ﬁeld yield a signal
proportional to normally ordered correlation func-
tions of that ﬁeld [1]. A quantized multimode ﬁeld
is then said to be coherent to order N if all nor-
mally ordered correlation functions up to order N
factorize. No such theory is presently available for
atomic coherence, probably because until recently it
had not been necessary to think of atomic samples
as Schr¨odinger ﬁelds. But the experimental work on
ultracold atoms, BEC [2–6] and atom lasers [7] has
changed that situation, and the need for a proper
theory of atomic coherence is now quite urgent [8].
At least for the case of bosonic ﬁelds, it is tempting
to simply transpose Glauber’s coherence theory [1].
This approach has been the de facto situation so far,
but appealing as it might sound, it must be applied
with caution, due to the fundamental diﬀerence be-
tween electromagnetic and matter-wave ﬁelds. Most
optical experiments detect light by absorption, i.e.
by “removing” photons from the light ﬁeld. This is
the reason why normally ordered correlation func-
tions are so important. But atomic detectors work
in a number of diﬀerent ways: One can chose to mea-
sure electronic properties, or center-of-mass proper-
ties, or both. While one detector might be sensi-
tive to atomic velocities, another might measure lo-
cal densities and a third electronic properties only.
Additional diﬃculties arise from the fact that atomic
ﬁelds are self-interacting, which signiﬁcantly compli-
cates the propagation of atomic coherence as com-
pared to the case of light. From these remarks, it
should be clear that a theory of matter waves coher-
ence is much richer than its optical equivalent. Yet,
like Glauber’s coherence theory, it should be opera-
tional and based on explicit detection schemes.

The goal of this note is to analyze several ideal
atom detectors and to determine which correlation

functions of the matter-wave ﬁeld they are sensitive
to. The systems we explicitly consider are a non-
resonant atomic imaging system such as used e.g.
in the MIT BEC experiments, and a detector work-
ing via atomic ionization. We show that while the
oﬀ-resonance imaging detector is sensitive to density
correlation functions, a narrow-band ionization de-
tector measures normally ordered correlation func-
tions of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld itself, in analogy with

complicated, due to the quadratic dispersion of mat-
ter waves. Higher-order detection schemes also in-
volve exchange terms usually absent in the optical
case.

Nonresonant imaging
Consider ﬁrst atomic detection by non-resonant
imaging, a situation where a strongly detuned elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld interacts with the atoms in the
sample in such a way that it induces only virtual
transitions. We consider for concreteness ground
state atoms described by the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld oper-
ator ˆΨ(r) with [ ˆΨ(r), ˆΨ†(r′)] = δ(r − r′) for bosons,
and decompose the electromagnetic ﬁeld into a clas-
sically populated mode of wave vector k0 and polar-
ization ǫ0 and a series of weakly excited sidemodes
of wave vectors kℓ and polarizations ǫℓ. After adia-
batic elimination of the upper electronic state of the
atomic transition under consideration, the interac-
tion between the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld and the radiation
ﬁeld is described to lowest order in the side-modes
by the eﬀective Hamiltonian

where kℓ is the wave vector of the ℓ-th mode of the
ﬁeld, of frequency ωℓ and polarization ǫℓ, the sum
is over all ﬁeld modes in the quantization volume
V , and Eℓ = [¯hωℓ/2ǫ0V ]1/2 is the “electric ﬁeld per
photon” of mode ℓ. The annihilation and creation
operators aℓ and a†
ℓ satisfy the boson commutation
relation [aℓ, a†
ℓ′ ] = δℓ,ℓ′. We have also introduced
the Rabi frequencies Ω0(r) = dE0(r)(ǫ · ǫ0)/¯h and
Ωℓ = dEℓ(ǫ · ǫℓ)/¯h, and the atom-ﬁeld detuning δ0 ≡

ωa − ω0 is assumed to be much larger than Ω0, δ0 ≫
Ω0(r).

Assuming that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is initially
in the state |Ei and the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld in the state
|φgi, the probability that the system undergoes a
transition from that to another state is given to ﬁrst
order in perturbation theory by

this goal is the ionization method that we now dis-
cuss.

Consider a detector consisting of a tightly focussed
laser beam that can ionize atoms by inducing transi-
tions from their ground electronic level |gi to a con-
tinuum level |ii. 1 The corresponding single-particle

where the Schr¨odinger wave density is deﬁned as

ˆρ(r, t) ≡ ˆΨ†(r, t) ˆΨ(r, t)

(3)

and Ψ(r, t) = U †Ψ(r)U is the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger ﬁeld in the interaction representation
with respect to the atomic Hamiltonian, i.e. U =
exp(−iHAt/¯h).

We further assume for concreteness that all elec-
tromagnetic sidemodes are initially in a vacuum.
The measurement on the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld is then
carried out by detecting photons scattered by the
atoms into the sidemodes, in a fashion familiar from
resonance ﬂuorescence experiments. The most im-
portant non-trivial contribution to the ﬂuorescence
signal is proportional to the intensity |Ω0|2 of the
incident ﬁeld,

H = Hcm + Hel + V (r) ≡ H0 + V

(5)

where Hcm is the center-of-mass Hamiltonian, Hel
the electronic Hamiltonian, and V (r) describes the
electric dipole interaction between the atom and the
ionizing laser ﬁeld. Hel has eigenstates ϕn and eigen-
frequencies ωn, Hel|ϕni = ¯hωn|ϕni. The corre-
sponding atomic manybody Hamiltonian is

where in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
ˆΨ(r) is a multicomponent ﬁeld with components
ˆΨn(r).

We are interested in measuring properties of the
ground state component ˆΨg(r) of this ﬁeld, which
is dipole-coupled to continuum states ˆΨi(r). We
assume for simplicity that the center-of-mass wave
function of these latter states is well described by
plane waves of momentum q, so that H may be ex-
pressed as

and hence is sensitive to the second-order correlation
function of the sample density. This is to be com-
pared to the results of Javanainen [9], who showed
that the the spectrum of the scattered radiation is a
function of hˆρ(r, 0)ˆρ(r, t)i. Indeed, it can be shown
in all generality that any measurement involving the
electromagnetic ﬁeld scattered by the atomic sample
under conditions of oﬀ-resonant imaging are deter-
mined by correlation functions of the Schr¨odinger
ﬁeld density.

Ionization
The reason oﬀ-resonant imaging yields a signal de-
pendent on ˆρ(r, t) is that the electric dipole interac-
tion is bilinear in the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld operators.
This diﬃculty can however be eliminated if, instead
of making measurements on the radiation ﬁeld, one
detects the atoms directly. One scheme that achieves

conclusions.)

In this detection scheme, one extracts information
about the state of the ﬁeld ˆΨg(r, t) by measuring,
the number of atoms in the continuum. For
e.g.
atoms cooled well below the recoil temperature and
tightly focused laser beams, the spatial size of the
atomic wave function is much larger than the laser
spot and we can approximate the electric ﬁeld E(r)
by E(r) ≃ Eδ(r − r0), so that Eq. (9) becomes

There is a fundamental distinction between the
present situation and Glauber’s photodetection the-
ory, because in the present case both the detected
and detector ﬁelds consist of matter waves. There
is a complete symmetry between these two ﬁelds so
far, and their roles are interchangeable. In order to
break this symmetry and to truly construct a de-
tector, we now make a series of assumptions on the
state of the detector ﬁelds ˆΨi(r, t). Physically, this
amounts to making a statement about the way the
detector is prepared prior to a measurement. Specif-
ically, we assume that all atoms are in the ground
state, Ψi(r0)|ψi,q(0)i = |0i, and that any atom in
an ionized state will be removed from the sample in-
stantaneously. In that case, the second term in Eq.

At this point, it is convenient to distinguish three
diﬀerent operating regimes: In the ﬁrst one, only one
ﬁnal electronic state is considered, and in addition
a velocity selector is used to ﬁlter just those ionized
atoms with a given center-of-mass momentum. We
call this a narrowband single-state detector. The sec-
ond scheme allows for a broader velocity ﬁlter, but

still considers a single continuum electronic state,
and we call it a broadband single-state detector. Fi-
nally, we also discuss a general broadband detector
where neither the ﬁnal momentum state nor the ﬁ-
nal electronic state is narrowly selected.

More precisely, a narrowband single-state detector
includes a velocity selector with a bandwidth ∆q
around a central value q0 such that for the detection
times ∆t of interest, one has ∆t∆ωq ≪ 1, where
∆ωq = ¯hq0∆q/2M . In this case and for a stationary
Schr¨odinger ﬁelds Eq.(13) reduces to

From the Wiener-Khintchine theorem, we recognize
that for large enough ∆t, the detector measures the
spectrum of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld ˆΨg(r0, 0).

GA(0, τ ; r0, r0), or in other words to the convolution
of the Fourier transforms of these functions. The
Fourier transform of the center-of-mass propagator
can therefore be interpreted as the spectral resolu-
tion of the detector.

We ﬁnally turn to the case of a general broad-
band detector, where the spectrum of the detector
is much broader than the spectrum of the detected
quantity. Assuming that the spectrum of the atomic
correlation function is centered at ¯ω, we ﬁnd

processes. But ionization detectors make destructive
measurements. This is in contrast to oﬀ-resonant
imaging, which is nondestructive but measures den-
sity correlation functions instead of the more fa-
miliar normally-ordered correlation functions of the
Schr¨odinger ﬁeld itself.

As expected, a broadband detector is not able to re-
solve any spectral feature of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld,
and only measures the local atomic density.

Higher-order correlations
The detection of higher-order correlation func-
tions of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld can be achieved by a
straightforward generalization of the ionization de-
tector. For instance, second-order coherence mea-
surements can be carried out by focussing the laser
at two locations r1 and r2, in which case

where we have introduced the detector cross eﬃ-
ciency η(r1, r2) as a straightforward generalization
of Eq. (18). The ﬁrst term in Eq. (20) is an ex-
change term resulting from the fact that the detector
ﬁeld is a single Schr¨odinger ﬁeld. It results from the
interference between detectors at points r1 and r2.
The second term is the usual term also appearing

in the double photo-detection of optical ﬁelds.
that latter case, the exchange term does not appear
because the two detectors used to measure the ﬁeld
are taken to be distinguishable. Note also that in the
position measurement scheme proposed in Ref. [10],
interferences do not occur as the set of states ionized
at each location are taken to be distinguishable. We
ﬁnally remark that as a consequence of the exchange
term, the signal cannot simply be expressed in terms
of correlation functions of ˆρ(r, t).

In summary, we have analyzed several detectors
that permit to access diﬀerent classes of correla-
tion functions of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld. Most in-
teresting perhaps is the ionization scheme, which is
closely related to the detectors familiar from the de-
tection of optical ﬁelds. However, it presents new

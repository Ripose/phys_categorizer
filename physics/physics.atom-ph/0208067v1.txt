We discuss the concept and design of eﬀective atom-atom potentials that accurately describe
any physical processes involving only states around the threshold. The existence of such potentials
gives hope to a quantitative, and systematic, understanding of quantum few-atom and quantum
many-atom systems at relatively low temperatures.

PACS numbers: 05.30.-d,34.10.+x,03.75.Fi,34.20.-b

The concept of model potential has played an im-
portant role in many branches of physics. The well
known examples include the Morse potential [1] and the
Lennard-Jones potential for molecular systems, and the
hard-sphere potential and the delta-function pseudopo-
tential [2] widely used in many-body theories, including
theories for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) [3].

There are many reasons why one uses a model potential
instead of the “real” potential. Here, we only empha-
size that a problem can simply become unmanageable
if the “real” potential is used. For quantum systems,
this statement quickly becomes true for three or more
atoms. This explains, in part, that despite its many lim-
itations, it has proven diﬃcult to go substantially beyond
the Gross-Pitaveskii theory for BEC that is based on the
delta-function pseudopotential [3].

Our goal here is to discuss the concept and design of
model potentials that better reﬂect the reality of atom-
atom interaction than either the hard-sphere potential or
the delta-function pseudopotential, yet simple enough to
allow for applications in quantum few-atom and quantum
many-atom systems. Here, being “simple”, to a large
extent, means being shallow, as it is the depth of a po-
tential, which can be measured by the number of bound
states it supports, that determines the complexity of the
resulting quantum few-atom and quantum many-atom
problems.

One of our key conclusions is the following. For N-
atom states around the N-atom threshold (such as the
BEC state [3]), or physical processes that involve only
states around the threshold (such as the three-body re-
combination process [4, 5]), the interaction potential be-
tween a pair of atoms, no matter how deep it might be,
can be replaced by an eﬀective potential supporting only
one or a few bound states. Furthermore, because dif-
ferent partial waves are described by the same eﬀective
potential, it can be used in precisely the same manner
as any “real” potential. And in doing so, one reduces
the complexity of the resulting quantum few-atom and
quantum many-atom problems to a level comparable to
that for He, a level that we are quickly learning to deal
with [5, 6].

If one thinks of the delta-function pseudopotential
[2] as describing the atomic interaction at the longest
length scale in the zero-energy limit, 2π/k, the nat-
ural next step is the description of atomic interac-
tion at the next, shorter,
length scale. This scale is
βn = (2µCn/¯h2)1/(n−2), which characterizes the long-
range atomic interaction of the form of −Cn/rn (n > 2).
The angular-momentum-insensitive quantum-defect the-
ory (AQDT) [7, 8] provides a systematic description of
atom-atom interaction at this scale, and is the basis of
our discussion.

Reference [7]

focused on two-atom systems with
V (r) → −C6/r6, but the same concepts and formula-
tion are readily generalized to any n > 2. In this general
formulation, a two-atom system with an asymptotic po-
tential of the form of −Cn/rn (n > 2) is described by
a dimensionless K matrix K c(ǫ, l) and a set of universal
functions that are determined from the solutions of

(cid:21)

uǫl(r) = 0,

(1)

where ¯ǫ ≡ 2µǫ/¯h2. Speciﬁcally, K c(ǫ, l) is deﬁned by
writing the wave function at large distances as a linear
superposition of a pair of reference solutions of Eq. (1):

uǫl(r) = Aǫl[f c

ǫl(r) − K c(ǫ, l)gc

ǫl(r)] ,

where f c and gc are purposely chosen to have the behav-
ior

(4)

for all energies [7]. Here y = [2/(n − 2)](βn/r)(n−2)/2.

AQDT asserts that K c(ǫ, l) is approximately a con-
stant that is independent of both ǫ and l, provided
that βn is greater than other, energy-independent, length
scales present in the system [7]. For our purposes here,
the most important conclusion of AQDT is the follow-
ing. To the extent of K c(ǫ, l) being energy and angular-
momentum independent, potentials with the same type of
long-range behavior (namely the same n) and the same

K c have, on a scaled energy basis, the same bound spectra
and scattering properties around the threshold [7]. Here
the bound spectra and scattering properties include all
angular momentum states for which K c remains approx-
imately l-independent.

Ignoring scaling relations implied by this statement,
which will discussed elsewhere [9], AQDT gives the fol-
lowing simple prescription for designing an eﬀective po-
tential that has the same physical properties around the
threshold as the system of interest. First, choose a model
potential. The only restriction is that it should have
the right asymptotic behavior. Second, adjust the short
range parameters of the model potential so that

K c

mod(0, l) = K c(0, l) ,

(5)

for one particular l. These two conditions do not uniquely
determine an eﬀective potential. Another auxiliary con-
dition, which gives a convenient characterization of the
depth of a potential, is the number of bound levels sup-
ported by a model potential for a particular l, Nl. For
classes of model potentials discussed below, these condi-
tions uniquely determine a model potential.

We stress here two classes of model potentials for which
K c(0, l), and the number of bound levels for each l, Nl,
can be found analytically. One class is of the type of a
hard-sphere with an attractive tail:

where [x] means the greatest integer less than or equal to

restrictive concepts [8, 11], can be derived from K c(0, l).
For example, the s wave scattering length, which is de-
ﬁned only for n > 3, can be obtained from K c(0, l = 0):

which will be denoted by HST. The other class is of the
type of Lennard-Jones LJ(n, 2n − 2):

where b = 1/(n − 2).

which will be denoted by LJn. In particular, this poten-
tial corresponds to a LJ(6,10) potential for n = 6.

For HST potentials, it is not diﬃcult to show that the

K c parameter at zero energy is given by [9]

K c

HST(0, l) = −

Jν0(y0) cos(πν0/2) − Yν0 (y0) sin(πν0/2)
Jν0(y0) sin(πν0/2) + Yν0 (y0) cos(πν0/2)

,

(8)
where ν0 = (2l + 1)/(n − 2), J and Y are the Bessel
functions [10], and y0 = [2/(n − 2)](βn/r0)(n−2)/2. The
number of bound levels for angular momentum l is given
by

NHST(l) =

m , jν0,m ≤ y0 < jν0,m+1
0 , y0 < jν0,1

(cid:26)

,

(9)

where jν0,m (m ≥ 1), is the m-th zero of the Bessel func-
tion Jν0 (x) [10].

For LJn potentials, the following results can be derived

with the help of a local scaling transformation [9].

K c

LJn(0, l) = tan(πν0/2)[1 + hl(z0)][1 − hl(z0)]−1, (10)

From these results, the HST and LJn types of po-
tentials can be readily designed according to Eq. (5) to
have the desired K c(0, l), and the desired Nl. Table I
gives a selected set of designs for the triplet state of a
23Na dimer. Here the potentials are designed to have
K c(0, l = 0) = 13.57, which is found numerically us-
ing the latest potential for a sodium dimer [12]. From
Eq. (13), this corresponds to an s wave scattering length
of 64.57 a.u. The number of bound s wave levels sup-
ported by this “real” potential is found numerically to
be 16.

Figure 1 shows the comparison of s and d wave par-
tial cross sections of eﬀective LJ(6,10) and eﬀective HST
potentials, both designed to support 16 s wave bound
levels and have a K c(0, l = 0) = 13.57, with the Na-Na
partial cross sections computed from the “real” potential
[12]. The results are hardly distinguishable over a wide
range of energies. In comparison, the hard-sphere poten-
tial (HS) fails quickly away from the threshold for the s
wave, and gives completely wrong results for the d wave.
This result conﬁrms the concept of eﬀective potential
based on AQDT. For our purposes here, however, what

wave bound level, with the “real” Na-Na cross sections [14].

is more important is how shallow the eﬀective potentials
can be while still maintain a good description of low-
energy characteristics of a real system. Figure 2 shows
the comparison of s and d wave partial cross sections of
an eﬀective LJ(6,10) potential, in this case designed to
support only a single s wave bound state, with the “real”
Na-Na results [14]. The agreements remain excellent.

Figure 3 shows similar results for a HST potential. In
this case, the HST potential that supports only a single
s wave bound state does not do as well near the d wave
shape resonance. But it quickly improves, monotonically,
as the number of bound levels it is designed to support
increases. By Nl=0 = 4, a good agreement is achieved.

FIG. 4: Zero-energy wave functions of eﬀective potentials with
four s wave bound levels compared with the “real” Na-Na
wave functions [14].

The robustness of these designs is not limited to the
description of scattering properties, it also applies to the
energies of bound states that are close to the dissociation
threshold, and to the wave functions. For example, for
eﬀective potentials supporting four s wave bound levels,
the HST gives a binding energy of 0.2027 GHz for the
least-bound s state, the LJ(6,10) gives 0.2003 GHz. Both
in good agreement with the result for the “real” potential,
which gives 0.2044 GHz [14]. Figure 4 shows that for
eﬀective potentials supporting four s wave bound levels,
the wave functions are well represented down to r = 20
a.u., covering basically all regions of space in which there
is an appreciable amplitude.

We stress that while only the results for sodium are
presented here. They are used to illustrate much more
general concepts. As the number of bound levels sup-

ported by an eﬀective potential increases, all physical
properties of states around the threshold converge to
the same results (see Figs. 1-4). This is the shape-
independence at length scale βn. The converged results,
properly scaled, represent a set of universal properties
shared by all quantum systems with the same type of
long-range potential, and characterized by the same,
l-independent constant K c = limβx/βn→0 K c(0, l) [7],
where βx represent the next shorter length scale present
in the system. The examples presented here, Figs. 2-
4, show how quickly this set of universal properties are
approached as one increases the number of bound levels
supported by an eﬀective potential. This quick conver-
gence is due to the fact that deviations from the uni-
versal behavior depend on a high power of βx/βn [9].
Other quantum systems diﬀer from Na primarily in K c
[7], which does not eﬀect this rapid convergence.

Note that we did not make any distinction between
two-atom and N-atom quantum systems in the state-
ments above, because the same apply to a N-atom sys-
tem. A short argument is simply that diﬀuse states,
in which atoms are mostly at large distances relative to
each other, only couple coherently to other diﬀuse states.
A longer argument can proceed as follows. The correct
K c(0, 0), and therefore al=0, ensures the correct results
at the mean-ﬁeld level [3]. The correct two-atom wave
function ensures the correct two-atom correlation.
It
also ensures the correct three-atom correlation, as fol-
lows. Think of a three-atom as a two-atom perturbed by
another. Frank-Condon considerations tell one that only
two-atom states around the threshold are signiﬁcantly
coupled. This means by having the correct two-atom
wave functions around the threshold, one has also the
correct three-atom correlation around the threshold. . . .
To illustrate the savings of computer resources as a re-
sult of using an eﬀective potential, consider the problem
of N interacting atoms in a symmetric trap of frequency
ω. If a real potential is used, the fact we need to rep-
resent the length scale of (2µDe/¯h2)−1/2 means we need
roughly De/¯hω number of harmonic oscillator states for
each atom, for a total of (De/¯hω)N number of states (ig-
noring statistics).
If an eﬀective potential is used, the
corresponding number is (De,eﬀ/¯hω)N . Thus the sav-
ing in the size of basis set is characterized by the factor
(De,eﬀ/De)N . For the triplet state of Na, De,eﬀ/De is
of the order of 10−3 if an eﬀective potential with two s
wave bound levels is used (see Table I). This corresponds
to a saving in the size of basis set of 109 fold just for a
three-atom problem. Even greater savings are achieved
for deeper potentials or for more atoms. From another
angle, for eﬀective potentials with Nl=0 ∼ 1, all length
scales shorter than βn have eﬀectively been eliminated.
It is this elimination of short length scales that makes a
complex problem more manageable.

On the other hand, if a good description over an even
wider range of energies around the threshold is desired,

4

the same methodology can be carried to scales shorter
than βn (e.g., β8 for atoms with a −C6/r6 long-range
interaction and a −C8/r8 correction) [9]. However, be-
cause the ratio β8/β6 is diﬀerent for diﬀerent systems, the
results become dependent upon one more system-speciﬁc
parameter. At this stage, going to shorter length scale
seems useful only in specialized two-atom applications
[9]. We also point out that it is around the threshold
that the quantum eﬀects are most important [15].

In conclusion, we have established the concept and de-
sign of eﬀective potentials describing atomic interaction
at the length scale of βn. It is the scale that one has to
deal with in studying quantum few-atom [4] and quantum
many-atom systems [3] at ﬁnite temperature, of high den-
sity, or under strong conﬁnement. We expect the method
presented to play a role in our understanding of some
of the more complex systems and processes at low tem-
peratures, such as the three-body recombination process
[4, 5], excited clusters states [6], and quantum liquids
[3]. In all cases, one can look for, and verify universal
properties at the scale of βn, by comparing results from
diﬀerent designs, such as HST and LJn, and by checking
convergences as one relaxes an eﬀective potential towards
more bound levels.

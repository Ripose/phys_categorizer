that obtained in the ﬁrst Born approximation.

INTRODUCTION

The explicit form of the cross section for electron scattering in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld

at arbitrary energy was obtained many years ago [1]. This form contains the inﬁnite series

with respect to the angular momentum. Though various approaches to the summation over

the angular momentum were developed in numerous papers, the numerical calculation of the

cross section with the use of the results of [1] still rather complicated problem. The detailed

review of the papers devoted to the problem under discussion can be found in [2]. In the

papers [3, 4, 5] the numerical calculations of the cross section were performed for various

scattering angles, the nuclear charge numbers Z, and the kinetic electron energy above

0.023MeV. For Z = 80 in the case of backward electron scattering, it was shown that the

ratio of the exact cross section and the Rutherford cross section increases from 0.15 to 2.35

when the electron kinetic energy decreases from 1.675MeV to 0.023MeV. Such big deviation

from the non-relativistic result stimulate the interest to the investigation of the exact cross

section at very small energy. In the present paper we have solved this problem calculating

the asymptotic form of the cross section for arbitrary Z and small kinetic electron energy.

II. CROSS SECTION

A simple way to derive the scattering amplitude is the use of the Green function G(r2, r1|
of the Dirac equation in the external ﬁeld. The wave function ψλp(r) can be obtained with

hand-side of (1) contains the additional factor (2pr1)iq, where q = Zαε/p , α = 1/137 is

the ﬁne-structure constant. In [6] a convenient integral representation was obtained for the

electron Green function in the Coulomb ﬁeld. Using Eqs. (19)-(22) of that paper, we arrive

The result (2) is in agreement with the well-known solution of the Dirac equation in the

Coulomb ﬁeld.

FIG. 1: The dependence of S on v for x =

are the exact results, the dashed lines are the asymptotics.

We see that for backward scattering the exact in Zα cross section diﬀers essentially from

dσB/dΩ up to rather small v , and this diﬀerence decreases very slowly (

√v). Strictly

∝

speaking, the asymptotics are valid when (S

1. Nevertheless, it is seen from Fig.1 that

the diﬀerence between the exact result and the asymptotics is small starting from v < 0.2.

For (1 + x)

1/q one can check that (S

1 starting from q > 10.

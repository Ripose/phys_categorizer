Local Momenta and a Three-Body Gauge

Abstract

In recent years researchers have attempted to improve the continuum state three-body wavefunc-
tion for three, mutually interacting Coulomb particles by including, so called, local momentum eﬀects,
which depend upon the logarithmic gradient of the continuum, two-body Coulomb waves. Using the
exact three-body wavefunction in the region where two of the three particles remain close, a revised
description of these local momenta, is attained and predicts that a quantum-mechanical impulse may
develop in the reaction zone, causing like-sign–charged particles to decrease their radial separation and
opposite-sign–charged particles to increase their radial separation. The consequences of these predictions
are investigated through both quantum and semi-classical techniques where the total energy of a two-
body continuum Coulomb system in the presence of a third, mutually interacting body are analyzed.
Numerical calculations conﬁrm that while ignoring these local eﬀects for light-ion–atom processes, may
be appropriate, three-body eﬀects may dominate in the reaction zone for heavy-ion–atom processes. The
techniques developed here are then applied to explain the observed asymmetry in the data collected by
Wiese, et. al.,[PRL 79, 4982] on the correlated breakup of three massive, Coulomb interacting particles.
The results are attributed to a genuine three-body eﬀect which rearranges particles in the reaction zone,
while retaining the appropriate asymptotic behavior. Preliminary calculations show a deviation of less
than 10% between the predicted and observed asymmetries. The strength of these results is then used
to argue that the local momenta, herein developed, be treated as a formal gauge constraint for three-
body interactions. This hypothesis is investigated and it is shown that a real-valued, position-dependent
phase is added to the wavefunction. A semi-classical analysis of the proposed three-body gauge, reveals
that while genuine three-body eﬀects may arise in the reaction zone, the asymptotic form of the rele-
vant two-body Hamiltonian remains unchanged for relative energies greater than ∼ 1eV for all atomic
species. Further analysis shows however that one may detect asymptotic variations in the scattering
amplitudes for massive systems at energies ∼ µeV. These results provide convincing theoretical and
physical evidence for the success of many current experiments and indicate that more experimentation
with near-threshold, massive three-body systems is needed.

Introduction

The ”three-body” problem is as old as the study of Physics itself. After Sir Isaac Newton showed (in his
Principia) that it was possible to infer the orbits of two, mutually interacting bodies using only the laws
of mathematics, mankind has endeavored to derive an analytic description of the motion of three, mutually
interacting particles.

Three-body interactions abound in natural processes as diverse as stellar evolution and thin-ﬁlm growth
and occur over a very wide range of energies. For the present discussion, continuum atomic scattering
will be considered for three mutually interacting charged particles interacting via the inﬁnite range Coulomb
potential. Calculation of local distortion eﬀects herein derived will be carried out over representative energies
of between 3 − 54.4 eV.1

1These energies were chosen because of the particular relevance to the results oﬀered in [6] on electron or positron scattering

from hydrogen.

In Section 2, the traditional Jacobi coordinates are introduced and key historical results are given.
While the notation used here is not substantially diﬀerent, minor errors have been corrected and additional
properties and unique results have been added.

A revised description of the so called local momenta, ﬁrst presented in [1] is oﬀered in Section 3. While
the local momenta derived here also depend upon the logarithmic gradient of a continuum state, Coulomb
wave - here referred to as the local distortion - the coordinate dependence is such that variations of the
momenta can not be ignored in an a priori manner. The development continues in Section 4, where a
detailed discussion of the mathematical and physical properties of the local momenta is oﬀered. Appendix
A shows that the local distortion can be expressed as a damped oscillator function that is analytic over all
regions, thus improving the ability to assess the possible contributions of these local eﬀects in both the inner
(reaction-zone), and the outer (asymptotic) regions of the three-body scattering event. 2 This analysis reveals
that while local distortion eﬀects generally “fall-oﬀ” in the asymptotic regions, they may alter the outcome
of a scattering event by rearranging particles in the reaction-zone. Appendix B demonstrates however that
one may incorporate local eﬀects while retaining the appropriate asymptotic form for the continuum state,
three-body wavefunction. From this a new interpretation of the three-body scattering event emerges, wherein
a two-body continuum pair acquires a local momentum by scattering oﬀ of an exact interaction potential.

Section 5 illustrates that generalized local momentum eﬀects may be used to explain the observed asym-
metry in the data collected in the triple-coincidence detection experiment of Wiese et. al., [2]. The experiment
considered three large, very nearly equal mass, mutually interacting, charged particles. With the appropriate
total center-of-mass energy and reduced mass parameters chosen to reﬂect those used in the actual experi-
ment, the predicted local eﬀects are shown to be large enough to reproduce the observed asymmetry. This
result is taken as motivation to hypothesize that the generalized local momentum be treated as a possible
gauge transformation for three-body interactions. In Sec. 6 this hypothesis is formalized and a semi-classical
analysis reveals that while a real-valued, position dependent phase is added to the two-body continuum state
wavefunction, the asymptotic form of the relevant two-body Hamiltonian remains unchanged.

2 Notation

The traditional Jacobi coordinates, here denoted by (~rν , ~ρν ) along with their respective, congugate momenta,
(~kν , ~qν), where ν = α, β, γ will be used to indicate a particular channel representation. These coordinates
are particularly well suited for the study of the motions of three mutually interacting particles because they
locate the conventional3 reduced masses of the system. These coordinates are shown in Figure 1 and the
“alpha-channel” representation will be used unless otherwise speciﬁed.

The reduced masses located by the (~rα, ~ρα) coordinates are given by

µα ≡

Mα ≡

mβmγ

mβ + mγ
mα (mβ + mγ)
mα + mβ + mγ

,

(1a)

(1b)

respectively and the other masses are deﬁned cyclically.

In addition, there are two relationships that the Jacobi coordinates and their conjugate momenta obey

that will be of use in the current development. These are,

~rα + ~rβ + ~rγ = 0
~kα
µα

~kγ
µγ

+

+

~kβ
µβ

= 0.

(2a)

(2b)

2While there is no rigorous convention for the quantiﬁcation of these regions, the “reaction zone” is here taken to be the

region wherein r < 10a0.

3While there is some debate in the literature, as noted in [3], over the appropriate reduced masses to use in the Classical
treatment of the three-body problem, the possible renormalization of mass in the Quantum treatment makes these arguments
irrelevant here.

where the Zν (ν = α, β, γ) are the appropriate charge signs. Moreover, the orthogonality of the Jacobi

(H ν

C (~rν , ~ρν) has been used, with supressed coordinate dependence, to indicate the full three-body Coulomb

To date, the most successful and widely used approximate solution to the three-body Schr¨odinger equation
is the paradigm “3C” wavefunction proposed by Redmond[4],[5] and rigorously derived and tested by Brauner
et. al.[6]. The solution is valid in the asymptotic region where all particles are far apart. Traditionally one
denotes this region with, Ω0, and the solution is given by,

ΨRED(Ω0)

~kν ,~qν

(~rν , ~ρν) = ei(~kν·~rν +~qν·~ρν ) Yν=α,β,γ

is the atomic Sommerfeld parameter. The hyper-parabolic coordinate,

ζkν ≡ kν rν + ~kν · ~rν ,

(10)

has been introduced for notational simplicity only, and with the above deﬁnition, the wavefunction (8)
satisﬁes all incoming boundary conditions in the region Ω0. The overwhelming opinion in the literature is
that all valid three-body wavefunctions must match smoothly with this solution in the region Ω0.

The logarithmic phase factors in the Redmond solution are present physically because of the inﬁnite
nature of the Coulomb potential, and arise mathematically as the leading term in the asymptotic expansion
of the conﬂuent hypergeometric function. i.e.,[7]

Cηkν (ζkν ) = Nηkν 1F1(iηkν , 1,−iζkν )
Cηkν (ζkν ) = Γ[1 − iηkν ]e−

These “C-functions” provide one of the representations for the exact solution to the two-body scattering

problem. That is, if one writes the two-body wavefunction as

ΨT wo−Body

~kν

(~rν ) = ei~kν·~rν Cηkν (ζkν ),

then substitution of this form into the two-body Schr¨odinger equation shows that

While the very intuitive solution (8) has been used with great success by researchers to model both atom-
ion [6],[9] and photo-ionization processes [10], a more robust solution has been sought in recent years[1],[11].
Particularly, a solution is sought that may be extended into the so called “interior regions,” where at least
two of the three particles remain close to one another. It is signiﬁcant to note that all of the successes of
the 3C wavefunction have been achieved for light-ion - atom systems, where the asymptotic form in Ω0 has
been shown to be generally adequate. What is sought however is a more precise accounting of the intimacies
of the three-body interaction for arbitrary masses and in all regions of the scattering space.

3 Origin of the Local Momenta

Because an exact solution to the atomic three-body problem does not exist, the best hope in achieving an
improved wavefunction has been to improve the approximation schemes used. Generally, these approximation
schemes fall into two categories:

• Approximating the Kinetic Terms of the Hamiltonian (i.e., the Eikinol approximation)
• Approximating the Potential Terms of the Hamiltonian

While these techniques would seem to be mutually exclusive, the problem is that the inseparable nature of
the three-body Coulomb potential makes the choice of the kinematic description impossible. Research has
thus continued along a fragile path and to account for approximation and/or distortion eﬀects, two well
established interpretations have emerged:

• Introduce a Local Momentum, which depends upon the radial separation of two of the three particles
through the logarithmic gradient of the continuum two-body wavefunction, and attribute the distortion
to a velocity-dependent, auxilary potential. cf., [1]

4

• Introduce an Eﬀective Charge, which depends upon the radial separation of two of the three particles
through the logarithmic gradient of the continuum two-body wavefunction, and attribute the distortion
to dynamical screening of charges. cf., [8]

The common dependence upon the two-body solution in these two interpretations is clear and in both
the dependence is derived in a rigorous, but a posteriori way, to satisfy the relevant boundary conditions
in the asymptotic regions. The natural question is if this dependence can be achieved in an a priori way,
utilizing only physical and mathematical intuition.

To approach an answer to this question, it is important to know that there does exist an exact solution
to the continuum three-body Schr¨odinger equation for the case when two of the particles remain close
together(or equivalently if one of the particles is inﬁnitely massive). The solution depends critically upon
the form of the three-body Coulomb potential in the region Ωα, where two of the particles, β and γ are close
together, while particle α is inﬁnitely far away from both of them. That is, one may write a description of
the region Ωα succinctly as follows:

Ωα :

lim rα → ∞,

lim

rα
ρα → 0

Clearly the region Ωα matches smoothly with the region Ω0, and to investigate the behavior of the three-body
Coulomb potential in this region, one may write

and the PL′ (ˆrα · ˆρα) are the Legendre polynomials of the ﬁrst kind.
the following asymptotic form:

ZL′ = Zβ(cid:18)−

µα

,

Now in the region Ωα, the only surviving term in the expansion is for L′ = 0. Hence the potential has

PL′ (ˆrα · ˆρα),

rα ≪ ρα,

.

(15)

The second term in this expansion is often referred to as the “reduced charge potential,” and the resulting
form of the three-body wavefunction is separable.
e.g., the three-body Schr¨odinger equation takes the
asymptotic form,

(cid:20)−

(16)

Because the term Zα(Zβ +Zγ )e2
separates and if one assumes that the three-body wavefunction has the standard plane wave form,

, the three-body Hamiltonian naturally

where the total energy of the three-body system may be written as

for continuum scattering, then substitution into the asymptotic three-body Schr¨odinger equation yields the
following equation for Φ~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) in the region Ωα:

(cid:20)−

(19)

Therefore the exact solution in the region Ωα is given by,

Ψ(Ωα)
~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) = ei(~kα·~rα+~qν·~ρν )Cηkα (ζkα )Cηqα (ζqα ).

Here the function Cηqα (ζqα ) is a reduced charge continuum state Coulomb wave, which satisﬁes

(20)

(21)

While equation (20) constitutes a rigorous solution it is not a valid solution because it does not match
smoothly with the result asserted by Redmond. (cf., equation (8) above.) To see this note that the asymptotic
form of (20) in Ω0 would be given by

Ψ(Ω0)
~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) = ei(~kα·~rα+~qα·~ρα)e−iηkα ln ζkα e−iηqα ln ζqα

(22)

Clearly, the two logarithmic phases present in this solution can not match smoothly with the three present
in the Redmond solution. Hence (20) does not constitute a valid solution in the asymptotic region Ω0.
In addition, note that as a general wavefunction in the region Ω0, (20) may not be a good choice simply
because when the two charges Zβ and Zγ are of equal and opposite charge, as in the paradigm case of
electron scattering from hydrogen, the solution in ~ρα reduces to that of a free particle. i.e.,

Ψ(Ωα,Zβ =−Zγ )

~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) = ei(~kα·~rα+~qν·~ρν )Cηkα (ζkα ).

(23)

These reasons make it clear that in order to extend the 3C wavefunction into the the asymptotic region,
Ωα (or into the interior regions for that matter) a diﬀerent approach is warranted. The current approach,
refered to here as “kinematic coupling,” involves the introduction of an exact interaction potential given by:

V α
I (~rα, ~ρα) ≡

e2

4πǫ0 

ZαZβ

mβ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)~rα + µα

Hence the three-body Schr¨odinger equation takes the exact form:

(24)

(~rα, ~ρα) = EtΨ~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα).

(25)

To remain completely general, one then asserts that the total center of mass energy may be written in

the form

Et = Eµα + EMα + EI ,

(26)

2µα

where Eµα ≡ ¯h@2k2
> 0 are the energies associated with the continuum state, two-body
clusters, µα and Mα respectively, and the term EI accounts for the remaining energy of the three-body
interaction. Though the deﬁnition (26) is nonstandard, it reﬂects the fact that because the three-body
potential must remain inseparable in a completely general solution, so too must the total energy.

2Mα

Due to the fact that the inseparable portion of the three-body Coulomb potential is now contained within

the interaction potential, one can assume that the three-body wavefunction takes the form,

Ψ~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) = ei(~kα·~rα+~qα·~ρα)Cηkα (ζkα )Cηqα (ζqα )χ~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) is an unknown function, and Cηkα (ζkα ) and Cηqα (ζqα ) are the known Coulomb waves
where χ~kα,~qα
deﬁned in equations (13) and (21) respectively. That is, the ansatz (27) incorporates the exact solution in
the region Ωα (cf., equation (20)) explicitly.

are the proposed position-dependent local momenta for this kinematic coupling model.

The principle diﬀerence in this development is that the local momenta arise purely from the physical
structure of the inseparable three-body Schr¨odinger equation, and that their mathematical form implies the
existence of position dependent momenta. Furthermore, in the current development, the local momenta are
predicted in a symmetric fashion so that both “legs” of the three-body interaction experience distortions
which depend upon the congugate coordinates. That is, ~rα is congugate to ~kα and ~ρα is congugate to ~qα. This
means that the distortion that two of the particles experience does not depend explicitly upon the distance
to the third particle as in [1], but is rather wholly attributable to a genuine three-body eﬀect wherein a very
intuitive description of the three-body scattering event arises:

The two reduced mass clusters µα and Mα, initially described by the two-body waves, Cηkα (ζkα )
and Cηqα (ζqα ) respectively, scatter oﬀ of the interaction potential VI (~rα, ~ρα) and acquire a local
momenta.

The subsequent motion of these clusters is then of course dictated by the function χ~kα,~qα
satisfy (29).

While one may argue that solving equation (29) is a greater task than solving the original Schhr¨odinger
equation, a solution that is consistent with the 3C wavefunction in the region Ω0 may be established. The
details of this solution are not important to the present discussion and are relegated to the appendices. (See
appendix B.) What will be of great importance is the nature of the predicted local momenta, (30).

4 A Generalized Local Momentum

The local momenta introduced in this kinematically coupled model depend upon the congugate coordinate.
Because of this variations in the momenta will generally contribute to the solutions. To understand how and
where these contributions will be important, a generalized “local distortion” term, ~D~p(~r) is introduced, where
~p and ~r may be either ~kν or ~qν and ~rν or ~ρν, respectively. Hence a general position-dependent momentum
may be deﬁned as follows:

where the exact form of the local distortion is given by5:

~P (~r) = ~p − ~D~p(~r),

.

While the general form (32a) has been used by many researchers, the form (32b) is unique and has been
introduced to help illucidate the physical signiﬁcance of the local momentum. e.g., one may write: (r 6= 0)

(1 + ˆp · ˆr)

.

(36)

(37)

The form (36) shows that the local momentum is essentially a 1

r damped-oscillator function, and that
it is analytic everywhere except possibly at r equal to zero. Interestingly, it can also be seen that the local
momentum has equal radiation (in the ˆr direction) and induction (in the ˆp direction) components. This is
indicative of the possibility of a tensor force in a Classical treatment or of a nonconserved current density
in a Quantum treatment of the three-body interaction. Perhaps more importantly, one sees that the local
distortion depends upon not only the radial separation of the constituent particles, but also upon both the
relative energy and reduced mass of the system.

In Figure 2 the real part of the distortion experienced by a electron-proton continuum pair has been
plotted with various relative energies and an arbitrary scattering angle of θ = 0. One sees immediately that

5See Appendix A for details concerning the derivation of this form.

the distortion “falls oﬀ” very quickly with increasing radial separation and even more dramatically with
increased relative energy.

To see how the distortion depends upon the reduced mass of the system, observe that in Figure 3, the real
part of the distortion experienced by an electron-electron pair and a electron-proton pair have been plotted.
Notice that the distortion increases accordingly with increased mass, and that the sign of the distortion is
diﬀerent for the cases of attraction and repulsion.

This very interesting point will be discussed in greater detail below, but for now note that in addition to
the important physical properties of the local distortion, there are also important mathematical properties.
The most important of these is that because the local distortion is essentially an oscillatory function, the
existence of turning and stationary (i.e., maxima and minima) points may yield much insight.

In Figure 4 one sees that the stationary points6 occur quite often, so that the local distortion will very
often be identically zero! Moreover, these zeroes will be very dense on a macroscopic scale and so may
greatly alter the topology of a scattering event. This can be seen even more dramatically in Figure 5, where
three-dimensional and contour plots of the local distortion have been shown.

Though there is no analytic form for determining the zeroes of the conﬂuent hypergeometric function,
the stationary points of the local distortion may be found by ﬁnding the nonzero roots to (37). Hence one
ends up solving the following transcendental equation:

1
r

=

p

2[nπ − δp(~r)]

(1 − cos θ),

(38)

where n is an integer. Note that if δp(~r) were a constant, (38) would be the equation of a conic section with
an eccentricity of 1 - parabolas. Hence one sees that the stationary points of the local distortion lie (very
nearly) along the classically forbidden “trajectories” for particles with positive energy! While this may seem
to be no more than coincidence, δp(~r) is in fact very nearly constant between the stationary points (see Fig.
6), and one may infer that these “zero-distortion-trajectories” are in fact the dominant contributions in a
path-integral approach to the quantum, three-body scattering problem. Indeed, from this point of view, one
may argue that they must be the dominant contributions for light-ion–atom processes in the asymptotic
regions, where great success has been achieved while ignoring local distortion eﬀects. What is not clear
however is how these local eﬀects will contribute in the so called “interior regions” or for heavy-ion–atom
processes.

5 Kinematic Rearrangement

Above it was noted that the local distortion had diﬀerent signs for the attractive and repulsive cases. The
real importance of this observation is that if one imagines a three-body system composed of a tightly bound
continuum state pair, with an initial momentum ~p, and a third, mutually interacting particle, then upon
break-up the continuum pair will acquire a local momentum ~P (~r). Hence the continuum pair will experience
a momentum change (or impulse) given by

Evidently one ﬁnds, (for r 6= 0)

The equations (40) imply that the two particles that are initially attracted to one another, within the
continuum pair described by Cηp(ζp), will experience an impulse that will tend to increase their radial

separation upon breakup and conversely, that two particles that are initially repelled from one another will
experience an impulse that will tend to decrease their radial separation. In other words, at small values of
the radial separation, opposite(same) sign-charged particles will tend to repel(attract) one another due to
the local distortion eﬀects!

To illustrate this point, the real part of the distortion for several diﬀerent continuum pairs have been
calculated and the results are shown in Figure 7. Observe that even though all of these distortion terms
decrease with increasing radial separation, the magnitude of the distortion in the interior regions depends
critically upon the system being studied. As was shown above in Figure 3, the distortion eﬀects increases
dramatically with an increase in the reduced mass. Speciﬁcally, note that for the case of a proton–anti-proton
((e) if Fig. 7) or proton-proton ((f) in Fig. 7), the range has been shortened accordingly, to show that the
distortion in the reaction zone is dramatically changed.
Indeed, for the case of the proton–anti-proton,
the magnitude of the local distortion eﬀect may be large enough and in a direction such that a kinematic
rearrangement of the particles may occur. In addition, because of the dependence upon the inverse of the
square-root of the relative energy, these eﬀects will be even more pronounced at lower relative energies.

This kind of phenomena can be observed in the data obtained by Wiese et. al., [2] on the breakup of the

excited ion (H +

3 )∗. This highly unstable ion of hydrogen decays in a two step process, as follows:

(H +

3 )∗ −→ H∗∗2 + H +

i → H +

f + H− + H +
i .

The data (see Figure 8) show a slight asymmetry with small increases in energy (from 6.5 eV to 7.5 eV)
which can be accounted for in a direct manner by considering the local distortion eﬀects herein derived.
To see this note that during the nearly co-linear breakup of the excited H +
3 ion the “initial”7 proton H +
i
is emitted in the forward direction and the doubly excited H∗∗2
ion is emitted in the backward direction.
The subsequent breakup of this ion occurs such that a “ﬁnal” proton H +
f and the nearly equally weighted
H− ion are formed.[2] At this point the H− is preferentially associated with H +
f . However, after the
f , H−) will acquire a local momentum, ~P (~r), which has a component in
breakup, the continuum pair (H +
the ˆr direction. Hence this gained momentum will act to increase the radial separation and will push the
H− over the Coulomb Saddle, so that it H− will be preferentially associated with the “initial” proton, H +
i .
Now, because the two protons are in fact indistinguishable, one will observe an asymmetry between “low”
and “high” energy scattering events. To help visualize this process, a schematic diagram (see Fig. 9.) has
been developed.

Further analysis shows that, as mentioned above, because the local distortion depends upon 1√E

, as the
energy is increased, a proportionately smaller number of particles will experience an impulse that is large
enough to alter their ﬁnal state distribution. Indeed, during the breakup of the H +
3 ion, the magnitude of
the local distortion eﬀects experienced by the (H +
f , H−) continuum pair while in the reaction zone are many
orders of magnitude larger than the eﬀects experienced by an electron-proton continuum pair. (see Fig. 10)
With this understanding, one may conclude in a straightforward manner, that the observed asymmetry can
be attributed to local distortion eﬀects of the three-body system. Moreover, the degree of asymmetry may
be predicted as follows:

r Ehigh
Elow ∝

amplitude of rearrangment at low energy
amplitude of rearrangement at high energy

.

Therefore, with the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction, one may write,

Elow ≡s Plow
r Ehigh
Phigh

(41)

(42)

where Phigh and Plow are the probabilities of rearrangement for the high and low energy states, respectively.
That is, using the actual data (See Fig. 8.) the ratio of the number of rearranged particles to the total

7“Initial” and “ﬁnal” are used here as in [2] to indicate the order in which the particles were detected during triple coincidence

measurements.

The absolute error between these two calculations is ≈ 8.7% and illustrates that the generalized local
momentum, herein developed may in fact be the actual momentum of the (H−, H +
f ) continuum pair during
breakup. Indeed, one may consider revaluating the importance of the generalized local momenta. Instead of
treating it as a mere mathematical nicety, one may place it on ﬁrm physical ground by viewing it is a formal
gauge condition for three-body interactions.

6 Towards a Three-Body Gauge

If one grants that the mathematical and computational evidence gathered here, is suﬃcient to guide further
experimental and theoretical investigations by considering the generalized local momentum as a formal
three-body gauge condition, then one can construct a three-body gauge transformation. i.e., one may write:

when working with three-body systems, in much the same way that one would write,

~p −→ ~P (~r) = ~p − ~D ~P (~r),

when working with particles in an external magnetic ﬁeld. (i.e., the Coulomb Gauge.)

The subtlety here is that while the transformation,

~p −→ ~P (~r) = ~p − e¯h ~A(~r),

(43)

(44)

~A(~r) −→ ~A(~r) + ~∇~rΩ(~r)

preserves the form of the magnetic ﬁeld, ~B(~r) = ~∇~r × ~A(~r), and provides for the global gauge symmetry of
the electromagnetic interaction, the condition (43) will contribute a real -valued, position-dependent phase
to the relevant wavefunction.8 Thus any proposed three-body interaction mechanism would require a local
gauge symmetry.9

To see how a position-dependent phase arises, one may consider a situation similar to that discussed in
Sec. 5. That is, consider three-body system consisting of a continuum pair described by the wavefunction,
Ψ~p(~r) = e−i¯h~p·~rCηp(ζp) together with a third, mutually interacting particle. Then, upon breakup, the pair
will acquire a local momentum and according to (43), the wavefunction will transform as follows:

Ψ~p(~r) −→ Ψ ~P (~r)(~r) = e−i[ ~P (~r)·~r]Cηp(ζp) = e−i~p·~re+i ~D~p(~r)·~rCηp (ζp).

Using (32b), one then ﬁnds that10, (for r 6= 0)

~D~p(~r) · ~r = a0ηp(cid:2)1 − cos(ζp + 2δηp)(cid:3) + ia0ηp sin(ζp + 2δηp).

8It is interesting to note however that, ~∇~r × ~D~p(~r) = i ~∇~r × ~∇~r ln Cηp (ζp) ≡ ~0.
9For those readers that are unfamiliar with the terms global and local in this context, note that a global gauge transformation
is one that preserves the modulus of the appropriate wavefunction. eg., Ψ(~r) → e−iaΨ(~r). On the other hand, a local gauge
transformation generally does not and may take the form, Ψ(~r) → ef (~r)Ψ(~r).

10Note that the “extra” a0 arises here because of the scale used in the plots. i.e., one writes ~r → a0rˆr.

11

(45)

(46)

Therefore the transformed continuum two-body wavefunction takes the following form:

Ψ ~P (~r)(~r) = ei~p·~reia0ηp[1−cos(ζp+2δηp )]e−a0ηp sin(ζp+2δηp )Cηp (ζp),

which shows the explicit form for the position dependent phase. i.e., one may write,

and see that the transformation is indeed indicative of a global gauge symmetry. eg.,

Sηp(ζp) ≡ ia0ηp(cid:2)1 − cos(ζp + 2δηp)(cid:3) − a0ηp sin(ζp + 2δηp),

Ψ ~P (~r)(~r) = eSηp (ζp)Ψ~p(~r)

(47)

(48)

(49)

It is of course the absolute square of the wavefunction that is truly important for predicting whether or not
this phase will signiﬁcantly eﬀect the experimental ﬁndings. To this end, one may take the absolute square of
(47) and show that the imaginary-part of the local distortion contributes a real -valued, position-dependent
phase. i.e.,

The exceedingly small magnitude of the term 2a0ηp sin(ζp + 2δηp) for the relative energy and reduced masses
of the systems considered in current research ﬁndings, makes it clear that one may write

|Ψ~p(~r)|2 = e−2a0ηp sin(ζp+2δηp )(cid:12)(cid:12)Cηp (ζp)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

= e2ℜSηp (ζp)(cid:12)(cid:12)Cηp(ζp)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

.

(50)

e−2a0ηp sin(ζp+2δηp ) −→ 1.

(51)

While this reinforces the fact that the proposed framework will leave the asymptotic description of the three-
body scattering event unaltered, (as was established in Appendix B) it does not address the extent to which
the proposed gauge transformation, (43) will alter the description in the reaction zone.

To begin an investigation of the expected behavior in the reaction zone, one may construct a semi-classical
expectation value for the total energy of the continuum pair, Cηp(ζp). To do this recall that the expectation
value of the semi-classical Hamiltonian for this system (before breakup) would be,

hH0(~p, ~r)i =

¯h2p2
2µ

Ze2

(52)

is the momentum of the continuum pair before breakup. During breakup, the pair will
where p =
acquire a local momentum, so that the expectation value of the semi-classical Hamiltonian for the system
would then become,

DH( ~P (~r), ~r)E =

¯h2(cid:16)k2 + | ~D~p(~r)|2(cid:17)

2µ

+

Ze2
4πǫ0

1
r

.

(53)

The eﬀects of the proposed gauge transformation may then be observed by plotting the expectation
values and varying the relative energy, E (see Fig. 11), the scattering angle, θ (see Fig. 12), and the reduced
mass, µ (see Fig. 13). All of these show undeniably that while the asymptotic form remains unchanged
with respect to variations of all kinematic parameters, genuine three-body distortion eﬀects may arise in
the reaction zone. Note speciﬁcally that the variation of the relative energy with the scattering reinforces
the interpretation oﬀered in Sec. 5. Speciﬁcally, the magnitude of the distortion eﬀects for large scattering
angles (corresponding to the nearly colinear breakup of the continuum pair) in the reaction zone may cause
two opposite-sign-charged particles to increase their radial separation, and appear to repel one another.
Conversely, two like-sign-charged particles would decrease their radial separation, and appear to attract one
another.

As a last exercise, one may ask if the position-dependent phase introduced by the three-body gauge

formalism could be measured. To answer this question one may observe that

e−2ηpa0 sin(ζp+2δp) ∼= e−2ηpa0 = e−

4πǫ0 ¯h √ µ

where (33) has been used for ηp, and E is measured in electron-volts. As mentioned above, this contribution
approaches unity for all systems of physical interest in the realm of current experiments in atomic physics.
One can however venture outside of this realm and ask what energy and/or reduced mass is needed to obtain
a measurable deviation from unity. If one uses the heaviest purely atomic species, either a proton-proton
(p− p) or a proton–anti-proton (p− ¯p) continuum pair, and assumes that a deviation of one part in a million
can be measured, then the energy scale needed is on the order of 1 µeV! The variation of the term e−2a0ηp
at these energies is shown in Figure 14, and illustrates that one may detect a change in the absolute square
of the wavefucntion, thus altering the relevant scattering amplitude. Moreover, the exceedingly small energy
scale required to detect these asymptotic distortion eﬀects in either electron(or positron) scattering from
hydrogen or in electron-electron or electron-positron ionization processes provides a precise understanding
for the success achieved in these areas while ignoring local momentum eﬀects.

7 Conclusion

In the above it has been shown that a generalized, position-dependent local momenta, which depends upon
the congugate coordinate through the logarithmic gradient of a continuum state Coulomb wave, may provide
evidence for the manifestation of genuine three-body distortion eﬀects in the reaction zone. The form of this
local momenta was derived from a consideration of the exact three-body wavefunction, for the case when
two of the three, mutually interacting, particles are far apart, and it indicates that the eﬀects do not depend
explicitly upon the location of the third particle. For this reason, the eﬀects may be viewed as a distortion
of the initial two-body continuum state wavefunction of the two remaining particles. This interpretation was
adopted, and it was shown that the local distortion eﬀects could be used to provided a rigorous, physical
description of the observed asymmetry in the data obtained by Wiese et. al., [2] on the breakup of three
massive Coulomb particles. The degree of this asymmetry was then predicted with an error of less than
10%, and it was also shown that while the distortion eﬀects were large in the reaction zone, the asymptotic
form of the relevant two-body interaction may be retained by treating the local momentum acquisition as
a three-body gauge constraint. Furthermore, the evidence for detecting asymptotic variations in the µeV
range, as presented in Fig. 14 suggest that more experimentation be focused on these low energy, heavy-
ion–atom processes. Indeed, these experiments may yield new insight into a mechanism by which electrical
forces may contribute to the fusion process! That is, the quantum-mechanical–impulse interpretation oﬀered
here shows that two like-charged particles may in fact attract one another due to local distortion eﬀects in
the reaction zone.

In addition to these ﬁndings and predictions, one may learn much by noting that by adopting the proposed
three-body gauge transformation, one ﬁnds that an electron-proton continuum pair exhibited a very small
amount of distortion in the reaction zone. This result provides a rigorous explanation of why the paradigm
3C wavefunction works so well for light-ion–atom scattering [6],[9]. Moreover, the general framework shows
that an electron-electron continuum pair would experience distortion eﬀects of lesser magnitude, due to its
greatly decreased reduced mass. These results can again be used to explain why Qiu et. al.,[10] achieved
amazing success in modeling electron-electron photo-ionization processes, while ignoring local momentum
eﬀects. Indeed, if one recalls the path-integral interpretation suggested in Sec. 5, then the success of these
ﬁndings for light-ion–atom processes may be attributed to the fact that the leading contribution to the
relevant cross sections are the “paths” along which the local distortion eﬀects are identically zero. While no
analytic form exists for calculation of these roots, one can compile a table for use in numerical calculations
and construct a solution that better reﬂects the physical nature of the three-body interaction.

A The Logarithmic Derivative of the 1F1(iηp, 1;−1ζp) Function

The logarithmic derivative of the conﬂuent hypergeometric function is deﬁned here as follows:

~D~p(~r) ≡ i~∇r ln 1F1 (iηp, 1;−iζp) = i

~∇r1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)
1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)

= iηpp 1F1 [(iηp + 1), 2;−iζp]

1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)

(ˆp + ˆr).

Then using the well known recursion relationship,(See reference [7] for instance.)

z
b

1F1 [(a + 1), (b + 1), z] = 1F1 [(a + 1), b, z] − 1F1 (a, b, z) ,

one may write11

(55)

(56)

~D~p(~r) = iηpp

[1F1 [(iηp + 1), 1;−iζp] − 1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)]

ζp1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)

(ˆp + ˆr),

ζp > 0.

(57)

Further simpliﬁcation of the logarithmic derivative is obtained by use of the Kummer relation[7] for the

conﬂuent hypergeometric equation. e.g.,

With this relation one ﬁnds that the distortion may be rewritten as follows:

1F1 (a, b, z) = ez

1F1 [(b − a), b,−z] .

(58)

(59a)

(59b)

r > 0.

~D~p(~r) = iηpp(cid:2)e−iζp

=

ηp

1F1(−iηp, 1; iζp) − 1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)(cid:3)
1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)(cid:21) (ˆp + ˆr),

r ˆp · (ˆp + ˆr)(cid:20)1 − e−iζp 1F1(−iηp, 1; iζp)

ζp 1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)

(ˆp + ˆr)

11Because of the division by ζp in equation (57), the region of validity for the logarithmic derivative is limited to ζp > 0 only

as indicated. One can however ﬁnd the actual value at ζp = 0. c.f. equation (62).

14

At this point note that the ratio of conﬂuent hypergeometric equations in equation (59b) is in fact a very

special case because the function on top is the complex conjugate of the function on the bottom! i.e.,

so that one may deﬁne a real -valued, position-dependent phase,

1F1(−iηp, 1; iζp) = 1F1†(iηp, 1;−iζp),

The logarithmic derivative may then be written as follows:

tan(cid:2)δηp (ζp)(cid:3) = ℑ [1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)]

ℜ [1F1(iηp, 1;−iζp)]

~D~p(~r) =(

ηp

iηpp(ˆp + ˆr),

r = 0
r h1 − e−i(ζp+2δηp (ζp))i ( ˆp+ˆr)
ˆp·( ˆp+ˆr) ,

.

,

r > 0

(60)

(61)

(62)

and one sees that in this form, the local distortion is analytic everywhere, except possibly at r = 0. This
result is very signiﬁcant, because it allows one to investigate the nature of the local momenta well inside
of the interior regions of a scattering event in a rigorous manner. Only in this way can one determine the
relative importance of these local eﬀects.

B An Alternative Three-Body Wavefunction

To solve equation (28) for the unknown function χ~kα,~qα
energy (cf, equation (26)) satisﬁes

(~rα, ~ρα) one normally assumes that the interaction

This technique was developed by Popalilios as referenced in [6], and asserts that the total center of mass
energy of the three-body system is partitioned among the two reduced mass clusters, µα and Mα. Hence
one may write

EI = 0.

(cid:20)−

(~rα, ~ρα) = 0.

(63)

(~rα, ~ρα) must be built to incorporate each term in the interaction potential.

To accomplish this, assume that χ~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) is given by

χ~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) = C−ηqα (ζqα )fβ(~rα, ~ρα)fγ(~rα, ~ρα),

where C−ηqα (ζqα ) satisﬁes

(64)

(65)

Because the function C−ηqα (ζqα ) is a known function, which exactly incorporates the interaction term

, this substitution results in the following (exact) coupled equations for the functions fν(~rν , ~ρν):(ν =

(68)

While these equations may seem even more complicated than the original equation, there are many

important aspects to note:

• The eﬀective potential reduces to the Coulomb potential for the ν-channel, in the asymptotic regions

Ω0 and Ωα. i.e.,

V (ǫ)(Ω0,Ωα)
ν,eﬀ

(~rν , ~ρα) =

ZαZǫe2

4πǫ0

1
rν

• The second term in ~Qǫ

α(~ρα, ~rǫ, ~ρǫ) vanishes in the asymptotic regions because,

(cid:2)Cηqα (ζqα )C−ηqα (ζqα )(cid:3)limρα→∞ −→ e−iηqα ln ζqα e+iηqα ln ζqα = 1.

(Indeed, this cancellation of the logarithmic phases was “built in” to the solution!)

(69)

(70)

• The ﬁrst two terms in ~K ǫ

α(~rα, ~rǫ, ~ρǫ) may be identiﬁed as a position-dependent, local momentum. i.e.,

~Kα(~rα) = ~kα − i~∇~rα ln Cηkα (ζkα ).

• The solutions are coupled in a completely symmetric way by the terms − i

2

~∇~rα ln fν(~rǫ, ~ρǫ) and

~∇~ρα ln fν(~rǫ, ~ρǫ), so that a numerical solution of these equations would be manifestly less computa-

− i
tionally intensive.

2

Furthermore, because the equations (66) are exact, they would be more reliable in ab initio calculations.

Approximate solutions that are valid through second order, may be achieved in a direct manner following
the techniques outlined in [12] and may be written in the form of distorted and coupled Coulomb waves.
e.g.,

fν(~rν , ~ρν) = CηKǫ

ν

(ζK ǫ

ν ) ≡ Γ(1 − iηK ǫ

ν )e−

, 1,−iζK ǫ

(71)

where the conventional, two-body normalization procedure has been employed so that that incoming wave
has unit magnitude.

The complete three-body wavefunction may then be written in the form:

ΨKC5C
~kα,~qα

(~rα, ~ρα) = ei(~kα·~rα+~qα·~ρα)Cηkα (ζkα )Cηqα (ζqα )C−ηqα (ζqα )CηK

a product of ﬁve, kinematically coupled Coulomb waves. To see that this solution is valid, ﬁrst note that
one can show in a straightforward manner that the distorted Coulomb waves have the following asymptotic
form:

Hence, due to the relationship (70), the asymptotic form in Ω0 will be identical to that of the Redmond, 3C
wavefunction.

C(Ω0)

(ζK ǫ

Figure 11: The eﬀects of the three-body gauge transformation are shown to depend critically upon the
relative energy of the continuum pair. Observe that as the relative energy of an electron-proton continuum
pair, with a scattering angle of θ = 0◦, is increased from (a) E = 3 eV to (b) E = 10 eV to (c) E = 54.4 eV,
the eﬀects in the reaction zone nearly vanish.

Figure 12: The eﬀects of the three-body gauge transformation are shown to depend critically upon the
scattering angle of the continuum pair. Observe that as the scattering angle of an electron-proton continuum
pair, with a relative energy of E = 10 eV, is increased from (a) θ = 0◦ to (b) θ = 75◦ to (c) θ = 150◦, the
eﬀects in the reaction zone become more pronounced.

Figure 13: The eﬀects of the three-body gauge transformation are shown to depend critically upon the
reduced mass of the continuum pair. Observe that as the reduced mass of the continuum pair, with a
relative energy of E = 10 eV and a scattering angle of θ = 0◦, is increased from (a) µ = 1µep to (b)
µ = 10µep to (c) µ = 20µep, the eﬀects in the reaction are dramatically altered.

Figure 14: Shown is the variation of the phase achieved by the three-body gauge transformation (see text
equation (43)) for (a) a proton-proton or proton–anti-proton, (b) an electron-proton or positron-proton and
(c) electron-electron or electron-positron continuum pair. Observe that as the reduced mass of the system
is decreased accordingly, the corresponding energy decrease is suﬃcient to detect a variation of one part in
a million.

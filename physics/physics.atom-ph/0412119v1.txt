In this paper we experimentally and theoretically investigate laser cooling of Strontium 88 atoms
in one dimensional optical molasses. In our case, since the optical cooling dipole transition involves
a Jg = 0 groundstate, no Sisyphus-type mechanisms can occur. We are thus able to test quantita-
tively the predictions of the Doppler-cooling theory. We have found, in agreement with other similar
experiments, that the measured temperatures are systematically larger than the theoretical predic-
tions. We quantitatively interpret this discrepancy by taking into consideration the extra-heating
mechanism induced by transverse spatial intensity ﬂuctuations of the optical molasses. Experimen-
tal data are in good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations of our theoretical model. We thus
conﬁrm the important role played by intensity ﬂuctuations in the dynamics of cooling and for the
steady-state regime.

INTRODUCTION

Initiated in the mid-seventies, laser cooling, trapping and manipulation of atoms rapidly became a very successful
ﬁeld of research [1], culminating twenty years later with the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation of alkali atoms
[2]. This success story begun with the seminal Doppler cooling theory which was designed for two-level systems [3, 4].
However, the ﬁrst reliable tests of the Doppler theory could only be performed at the end of the eighties. As it
turned out, the measured temperatures in the experiments were well below the predicted Doppler values [5]. This
surprising results indicated that another much more eﬃcient cooling mechanism was at work in the experiments. This
mechanism, now known as Sisyphus cooling, was identiﬁed soon after [6]. The key point was to understand that
internal groundstate degeneracies were opening the way to a new cooling mechanism based on optical pumping in the
presence of polarization gradients. This cooling mechanism is now the basic ingredient for most experiments in the
ﬁeld and thus gave the Doppler theory a more academic status.

Recent laser technological advances however opened the way to cooling and trapping experiments with earth-alcaline
and rare-earth atoms (Calcium Ca, magnesium Mg, strontium Sr and Ytterbium Yb). As these atoms exhibit a zero
spin groundstate, Sisyphus cooling is absent. Interest in testing the Doppler theory to gain better control on achievable
temperatures has thus been renewed. To our knowledge, all experiments on laser cooling of these atoms [7, 8, 9, 10]
always reported much larger temperatures than the Doppler theory prediction. This is a strong clue in favor of
an extra-heating mechanism still to be clearly identiﬁed. Approaching the Doppler limit in magneto-optical traps
(MOT) operating with earth-alcaline atoms seems a challenge and a better understanding of this heating mechanism
is required for future experimental improvements. To our knowledge only one explanation has been published to
understand these high temperatures [11]. The argumentation is based on heating induced by inelastic collisions.
However, as the authors themselves show, this heating mechanism sets in only for atomic densities much higher than
for those measured in typical MOT (109
1011atoms/cm3). For this reason this explanation fails to understand the
results presented in this paper and also in all previously cited publications.

−

Heating mechanisms depending on the density and/or the number of atoms in the cold MOT cloud are well known
even for degenerate groundstate atoms [12]. They essentially rely on reabsorption of scattered photons in the cold
MOT [13]. This situation is encountered as soon as light multiple scattering sets in, i.e. when the light scattering
mean free path ℓ is comparable to the MOT size L. Similar multi-atoms and multi-photons eﬀects certainly also exist
2.5 109atoms/cm3) and
with earth-alcaline MOTs, but they can be made negligible by working at low densities (n
0.3 at resonance).

Strictly speaking, Doppler theory can also be tested with degenerate atoms provided a suitable molasses polarization
conﬁguration is chosen [14]. Indeed, for 1D-cooling with parallel polarizations (σ+
π conﬁgurations), no
Sisyphus cooling can occur. However, even in this case, the authors found unusual high temperatures. They suggested
that this discrepancy was due to molasses intensity imbalance, leading to a local drift of the atomic average velocity
in the cloud. We agree with this explanation as we will show in detail in this paper.

We have performed speciﬁc temperature measurements on 88Sr (Sr in short hereafter) in a 1D-cooling conﬁguration.
This is the ideal situation to test the Doppler theory for two reasons. First, we induce cooling on a Jg = 0

interference between the six laser MOT beams can induce light shifts modulations, leading to modiﬁcations of the
usual friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients [15]. These spurious eﬀects do not exist in 1D conﬁguration with mutual
orthogonal polarized counter-propagating laser beams. The new important ingredient here is that we incorporate in
the original Doppler theory the eﬀect of transverse spatial intensity ﬂuctuations of the laser molasses proﬁles.

The paper is organized as follows: after some details about the experimental procedure, we compare velocity
dispersion measurements with the Doppler theory predictions (section II). We have found temperatures 10 times
0.2 m/s
larger than predicted. Indeed, at a laser detuning δ =
(T
0.5 mK). In section III, we will show, on very
general arguments, why the molasses transverse intensity ﬂuctuations heat the cold cloud. We then derive an analytical
model valid in two limiting cases: when the transverse distance L⊥ travelled by an atom during the longitudinal
velocity damping time is much shorter or much longer than the transverse correlation length ξs of the molasses
intensity ﬂuctuations. As expected, these two diﬀerent limits give rise to diﬀerent ﬁnal velocity distributions. In
subsection III D, we will compare our results to a Monte-Carlo simulation. Most of our experimental data correspond
to L⊥
In this case, the dynamics of the velocity distribution shows an unusual behavior. The velocity
dispersion σv is ﬁrst reduced by the friction force and then increases after a time scale related to ξs (section IV).

The cold strontium cloud is produced in a MOT. The Jg = 0

is the optical atomic line 1S0 −
1P 1 at λ = 461 nm. The excited-state natural linewidth is Γ/2π = 32 M Hz and
the corresponding saturation intensity is Is = 42.5 mW/cm2. First an eﬀusive Sr beam is extracted from a 500◦ C
oven. Then a 27 cm long Zeeman slower reduces the Sr longitudinal velocity within the velocity capture range of
the MOT (
50 m/s). The Zeeman slower, MOT, and probe laser beams operate at 461 nm and are generated
from the same frequency-doubled source detailed in [16]. Brieﬂy, a single-mode grating stabilized diode laser and a
tapered ampliﬁer are used in a master-slave conﬁguration to produce 500 mW of light at 922 nm. This infrared light
is then frequency-doubled in a semi-monolithic standing-wave cavity with an intra-cavity KNbO3 nonlinear crystal.
The cavity is resonant for the infrared light while the second harmonic exits through a dichroic mirror providing
150 mW of tunable single-mode light, which is then frequency locked on the 461nm Sr line in a heat pipe. We use
acousto-optic modulators for subsequent amplitude and frequency variations. The MOT is made of six independent
trapping beams. Each beam is carrying an intensity of 5.2 mW/cm2 and each beam waist is 8 mm. The trapping
beams are red-detuned by δ =
Γ with respect to the atomic resonance. Two anti-Helmoltz coils generate a 70 G/cm
magnetic ﬁeld gradient to trap the atoms. The number of trapped atoms, as deduced from ﬂuorescence measurements,

B. 1D-cooling and time-of-ﬂight measurements

In addition to the previously discussed experimental set-up (MOT, Zeeman slower), two additional contra-
propagating laser beams are used to perform a 1D molasses (see ﬁgure 1). These 1D cooling beams are located
in the horizontal plane. Some quarter-wave and half-wave plates are used to ﬁx the relative polarizations of the two
contra-propagating laser beams. An acousto-optical modulator in a double-pass conﬁguration is used to adjust the
laser frequency from resonance down to
Γ. The same acousto-optical modulator is used to control the laser intensity
up to Is. The beam waist is 3.5 mm at the cold cloud position, thus much bigger than the MOT size.

The time sequence of the experiment is generated by a personal computer with digital output ports dedicated to
this task. An internal clock updates and synchronizes the digital output ports every 10 µs. This elementary time
step is short enough for our purposes. The digital output ports are connected to switches which turn on and oﬀ the
lasers beams (rising and falling times shorter than 1 µs), the magnetic ﬁeld (rising time of few ms and falling time of
100 µs) and the CCD camera chopper (opening and closing times of 200 µs). The time sequence is designed as follows:
ﬁrst the MOT is operated during about 20 ms. Then the MOT lasers and magnetic gradient are switched oﬀ. The
1D-molasses laser beams are then switched on during 500 µs. This cooling time is appropriately chosen : atoms reach
the cooling steady-state regime while, at the same time, the expanding atomic cloud remains smaller than the cooling
beams size. After the 1D-cooling sequence, the temperature of the cold cloud is extracted from a time-of-ﬂight (TOF)

3

measurement technique. For this purpose, all the laser beams are switched oﬀ and the cold cloud expands ballistically
in the dark. The duration of the dark period is varied from a few 100 µs up to 1.5 ms. Then a ﬂuorescence image of
the expanding cloud is recorded on a CCD camera by brieﬂy switching on the MOT beams during 20 µs. The whole
time sequence is then repeated as long as necessary to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio (see ﬁgure 1).

Figure 2 shows three images of the cloud after diﬀerent ballistic expansion times. The elliptical shape of the cloud
is a signature of the 1D-cooling sequence.
Indeed the cooling axis is precisely the small axis of the ellipse. This
dimension will be thereafter referenced as the longitudinal axis. In the two other dimensions, thereafter referenced
as the transverse axes, the cloud is heated by random spontaneous emission. From these images, we extract the
dispersion of the longitudinal spatial distribution of atoms in the cloud, integrated over the transverse directions.
Because of the ﬁnite size of the image, we cannot have access to the long tail of the spatial distribution. Hence,
we truncate all recorded distributions at 2% of their maximum value. Assuming the initial atomic positions and
velocities in the MOT to be uncorrelated and centered, the ballistic time evolution of the spatial dispersion is simply

It consists in probing the cold cloud with an ultra-stable laser beam tuned on resonance with the 1S0−

by measuring the Doppler-induced spectral width. We have checked that these two diﬀerent techniques give the same
results, thereby conﬁrming the validity of the TOF measurements, easier to handle, and for this reason routinely used
in this experiment for temperature measurements.

C. Doppler theory and results

Doppler theory is based on absorption-ﬂuorescence cycles which induce a cooling mechanism competing with a
heating mechanism. Cooling is due to a mean friction force F =
mγv which damps the velocity and heating is
due to a Langevin ﬂuctuating force Fν (photon noise) giving rise to diﬀusion with constant D in velocity space. At
equilibrium these processes exactly balance (ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem) and the Doppler temperature is found
to be kBTD = m σ2

in [5] for the diﬀusion constant D. The analytical expression of the Doppler variance at low laser intensities I and
negative detuning δ is then

attenuation (Lambert-Beer law). This means that the average optical force is weaker for atoms located deep in the
cloud and we get, as a net eﬀect, an average compression force. In a MOT, these compression and repulsion forces are
equilibrated by the trapping force [19]. This is not the case in optical molasses. In a 1D-molasses, the compression
force is expected to dominate over the repulsion force induced by photon reabsorption, at least at moderate optical
thicknesses. A quantitative estimate of multiple scattering eﬀects is thus not easy. For example, in our case, the
Lambert-Beer law predicts a maximum relative intensity imbalance of approximately 23% at low intensity, which is
not negligible. However our experimental results strongly suggests that multiple scattering velocity inhomogeneous
broadening is small. Indeed, as s0 is increased, the optical thickness decreases since the scattering cross-section is
reduced. The compression force is thus decreased and cannot explain the strong increase of σv vs s0 evidenced in
ﬁgure 4. Furthermore, multiple scattering induces some correlations between position and velocity which should alter
the cloud ballistic expansion. This has not been observed in ﬁgure 2. As an ultimate test, we have change the number
of atoms in the MOT by a factor 3 without detecting any modiﬁcation of σv.

III. COOLING WITH INTENSITY IMBALANCE

We analyze in this section how spatial stationary transverse intensity ﬂuctuations can modify the Doppler cooling
predictions in a quantitative way. Starting from the analytical expression of the average force in 1D molasses, we
take into account these spatial intensity ﬂuctuations and we derive analytical results in two limiting cases, namely
when cooling is achieved before intensity ﬂuctuates and in the opposite case. This analytical model neglects the
photon noise encapsulated in the Langevin force Fν leading to a nonzero Doppler temperature. However, for a
quantitative comparison with experimental data, we have developed a Monte-Carlo simulation which fully takes into
account all ﬂuctuating mechanisms (molasses intensity ﬂuctuations and photon noise). These results will be detailed
in subsections III C and III D.

A. Origin of spatial intensity imbalance

In the standard Doppler theory, the molasses beams are described as perfect plane waves. In real experiments
however, the beams have a Gaussian-shaped transverse proﬁle. Usually one can ignore the transverse dimensions of
the beams because they are generally much larger than the MOT size. Nevertheless, the transverse intensity proﬁles
are not defect-free ideal Gaussian proﬁles. Indeed, even starting from diﬀraction-limited laser beams, imperfections
of optics elements (dust, aberrations, etc) induce scattering which generates an intensity speckle. Of course, in well-
controlled experiments, this speckle pattern remains relatively small compared to the average beam intensity, but
those two ﬁelds add coherently. In our experiment, we have measured the laser beam spatial transverse ﬂuctuations
by placing a CCD camera at the approximative position of the MOT. Subtracting the ideal Gaussian proﬁle, we have
computed the intensity ﬂuctuations histogram (see ﬁgure 5). We found a Gaussian histogram with a relative standard
deviation (with respect to the average intensity) in the range 10

20%.

The 1D-molasses is created by two contra-propagating beams issued from the same source. However, the speckle
intensity generated by the optics imperfections in each arm are independent. It is thus reasonable to consider, at
each transverse position in the beam proﬁle, the intensities Ii (i = 1, 2) of the two molasses beams to be random
independent Gaussian variables. Noting by si the corresponding on-resonance saturation parameters, we assume the
(si) to be the same for the two beams. Hence the (common) ﬁrst two moments, at each

The friction force is given by the term proportional to v and gives rise to a mean damping time:

Consider now an atom moving across the molasses beams with transverse velocity v⊥. This velocity is unaﬀected by
the longitudinal cooling. So, as the atom ﬂies across the beam, it may experience induced temporal molasses intensity
ﬂuctuations. The induced correlation time of these ﬂuctuations is simply

We have thus two competing dynamical processes, the cooling one with characteristic time τv and the intensity random
(induced) temporal variations with correlation time τs. The global velocity dynamics can be easily analyzed when
these time scales are well separated.

For atoms fulﬁlling this condition, the damping process is completed before intensities ﬂuctuate. Then the constant

zero. However, because ξs is much shorter than the cloud size, each atom experiences randomly ﬁxed distributed

To ﬁnd the ﬁnal velocity distribution, one has to incorporate the photon noise force Fν . As the photon noise and

In this regime, the molasses intensities ﬂuctuate wildly before the atom reaches its stationary state. Thus they

Figure 6 shows σv as a function of rs in the long and short correlation time limits (∆ =

σv goes to zero in both limits. This does not mean that the temperature goes to zero in experiments. Indeed, in
the previous discussion we have discarded the photon noise at the physical origin of the bare Doppler theory. Its
contribution at low saturation is given by the dotted line in ﬁgure 6. We can see that the noise induced by long
correlation times starts to dominate at rs > 2.5%, a fairly small value. Hence, to achieve cooling up to the Doppler
limit at ∆ =
1, one has to minimize the ratio τc/τv for a ﬁxed value of rs. This can be done in diﬀerent ways. First,
by decreasing the laser intensity to increase τv. Second, by decreasing τs. As shown by (8), this can be achieved
either by avoiding large transverse intensity defects in the laser proﬁles to decrease the correlation length ξs or by
increasing v⊥. This is indeed was has been observed in atomic beam experiment [21] where temperatures very close
to the Doppler limit had been found along one transverse dimension.

In a MOT, if the ﬂuctuations of the transverse intensities are not the same for all three dimensions, the temperature is
expected to be anisotropic. Moreover coupling mechanisms occur between the cooling dimensions. Thus high velocity
dispersion along one dimension tends to reduce the temperature in the orthogonal plane. In our 1D-molasses, the
transverse velocity is ﬁxed by the initial MOT sequence and τs/τv is usually bigger than 1. As we will see in Section
III.D., this means that transverse intensity ﬂuctuations are the major heating mechanism.

C. Monte-Carlo simulations

In order to quantitatively test our theory and not relying on questionable approximations, we have developed a
Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. This MC simulation fully takes into account the photon noise leading to the Doppler

The shortest time scale in the MC calculation is given by the excited-state lifetime τe = 1/Γ. To mimic the
transverse ﬂight of atoms, the molasses saturation ﬂuctuations δsi = (si

This last result can be found more elegantly by squaring (16) and averaging over the probability distribution of Rn.
Hence experimental determination (or convenient choice) of the macroscopic ingredients τs and σs ﬁxes in principle

Figure 7 shows the obtained ﬁnal velocity dispersion σv as a function of τs/τv for s0 = 0.04 and rs = 9%. The

D. Quantitative comparison with experimental data

≈

We have showed in section II.C that the measured velocity dispersion were always larger than the Doppler theory
predictions. We now compare our experimental data with the results of our previous MC simulation. In order to
stick as close as possible to the experiments, we also take into account the transverse velocity distribution (a centered
Gaussian with dispersion ∆v⊥

0.8 m/s) in the MC simulation.

In ﬁgure 3 the solid curve corresponds to the MC simulation performed at rs = 9% and ξs = 60 µm. These
quantities are ﬁt-parameters in the MC simulation but remain in the range of the measured ones (see III A). As one
can see, the agreement with experimental points is now very good, providing a clear understanding of the physics
at work in the experiment. Coming back to (6), close to resonance, the friction term decreases while the intensity
imbalance term increases. Hence, the mismatch between experiment and Doppler theory is maximal.

Again, an excellent agreement between MC simulation (solid curve) and data is found in ﬁgure 4. To properly
understand these results, one has to remind that the cross-over region between the long- and short-correlation time
0.1. TOF measurements before the molasses sequence
limits is given by τs = τv, or equivalently by s0 = v⊥/2γvξs
0.8 m/s whereas ξs is the chosen MC parameter. This is exactly what is seen in ﬁgure 4 and the
have shown that v⊥
≈
τv) was not experimentally
Doppler theory is recovered when s0 →
accessible because the 1D-cooling duration sequence was not long enough to reach the steady state. This is why most
of the data points correspond to the long-correlation time limit (τs
τv) and can be compared to (9). This is done in
ﬁgure 4 where the dashed line corresponds to the prediction given by (9). The general behavior is correct, indicating
that saturation of the atomic transition indeed plays a signiﬁcant role. However the prediction (9) is a little bit too
large. This is not surprising since, for the explored range of parameters, some atoms will always have suﬃciently high
transverse velocities to fulﬁll the short correlation time criterion, both in the experiment and in the MC simulation.
As a consequence, the velocity dispersion σv will be reduced. In other words, (9) corresponds to a zero-transverse
velocity case giving over-estimated predictions.

Figure 8 shows the longitudinal spatial distribution obtained for the longest ballistic time at ∆ =

It is two times broader than the initial spatial distribution and essentially proportional to the velocity distribution.

We can then try to compare it to the velocity distribution obtained with the MC simulation (solid line). We have also
plotted the Gaussian distribution expected from standard Doppler theory (dashed line). The actual non-Gaussian
0.8 m/s). For each ﬁxed
shape of the MC distribution is explained by the transverse velocity dispersion (∆v⊥
transverse velocity, the distribution is quasi-Gaussian with a width depending on v⊥ (see ﬁgure 6 and discussions
in Section III B). For this simple reason, summing over the transverse velocity distribution leads to a non-Gaussian
distribution. The non-Gaussian shape of the MC simulation matches the experimental distribution better than the
Gaussian one.

≈

As a conclusion of this section, we again stress that we have quantitatively explained both the behavior of the
velocity dispersion σv as a function of laser detuning and intensity and the observed non-Gaussian distributions. This
puts strong evidence on the fundamental role played by molasses intensity defects in the cooling process.

IV. COOLING DYNAMICS

Figure 9 show the time evolution of σv for three diﬀerent values of τc corresponding to the short, intermediate
and long correlation time limit. When τs is short (or equivalently v⊥ large), the corresponding curve (a) displays an
exponential-type behavior decaying to the Doppler steady-state value. This curve is in agreement with the dashed line
Doppler prediction. When τs is long (or equivalently v⊥ small), the dynamics evidenced by curve (c) is more complex.
First σv reaches a minimum value within a time scale corresponding to the damping time τv. Then, σv increases again
and reaches the steady state value σ∞ predicted by (9). When the mean velocity and the local intensity imbalance
are uncorrelated in the initial state, then this long correlation time behavior is generic and does not depend anymore
on the initial state. Because the intensity correlation length ξs is large, the heating mechanism takes also some time
to build up and the initial velocity distribution starts ﬁrst to shrink. This is easily explained by considering the
dynamics induced by (4) for times shorter than τs where transverse intensity ﬂuctuations are dynamically frozen.
After a proper averaging over intensities ﬂuctuations, the following analytic expression for σv(t) is derived:

clearly evidencing the velocity spread narrowing at small times. We have experimentally tested this speciﬁc behavior.
Once the MOT is loaded, we have switched oﬀ the cooling laser beams within a time window of variable duration
τdark. This dark sequence must be long enough to allow atoms to travel over transverse distances larger than the
correlation length ξs of intensity ﬂuctuations. Then, once the cooling lasers are switched on again, any correlation
between the mean atomic velocity and the local intensity imbalance is wiped out. We should thus observe the behavior
predicted by curve (c) in ﬁgure 9. The velocity dispersion σv is measured after a time τ by the TOF technique (see
section II). In ﬁgure 10(a), we plot σv as a function of τ after a dark period τdark = 0.5 ms. We reproduce nicely the
corresponding theoretical prediction. First we observe a decrease of σv followed by an increase, up to the ﬁnal value
(which is here the same as the initial value). We also checked that the dark period has to be long enough, as evidenced
in ﬁgure 10(b). When τdark is short enough (less than 1 ms), decorrelation between the mean atomic velocity and
local intensity imbalances is not completed. When τdark is long enough (larger than 1 ms), complete decorrelation is
achieved and the dark period no longer plays any role in the cooling dynamics.

For practical reasons, these experiments were done with the MOT (i.e. on an 3D-cooling conﬁguration in the
presence of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient) whereas the MC simulations were done for a 1D-cooling scheme. This major
diﬀerence does not allow for a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment. However, the qualitative
agreement is pretty good. This result suggests that the dominant extra-heating mechanism in a MOT is the same as
in 1D-molasses.

Because the velocity distribution always starts by a compression period, one could imagine a cooling strategy
implementing suitable repetitions of dark time windows to achieve Doppler-limited cooling. This simple idea however
is not easy to handle because complete decorrelation between initial atomic velocities and intensity imbalances during
these dark windows is requested. As the cloud cools down, the duration of the subsequent dark periods has to be
increased accordingly to maintain this decorrelation. Unfortunately, as soon as the cooling time becomes very long,
spurious eﬀects such as large cloud expansions, then have time to set in.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have evidenced in this paper the important role played by transverse spatial intensity ﬂuctuations in 1D laser
cooling of zero spin groundstate atoms where no Sisyphus cooling can occur. For intensity imbalanced molasses beams,
the total radiation pressure force decomposes, at small velocities, into a friction force and a constant force. The latter
is at the root of an additional heating mechanism. These two forces essentially depend linearly on the molasses
In the presence of sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms, the friction term becomes intensity-independent
intensities.
whereas the constant force remains proportional to the intensity [5, 22, 23]. Hence, with sub-Doppler cooling, the
eﬀect of intensity imbalances can be arbitrarily small and, in turn, does not play any signiﬁcant role. This is completely
diﬀerent for Doppler cooling where this eﬀect remains dominant in most experimental cases.

The cooling steady-state reached by the atoms depends sensitively on the ratio ζ between the correlation length of
transverse intensity ﬂuctuations and the transverse distance travelled by the atoms before reaching the steady-state.
For small ζ, the transverse ﬂuctuations can be modelled by a Langevin force inducing an additional heating mechanism.
For large ζ, the equilibrium state is reached at frozen molasses intensities. Atoms at diﬀerent transverse positions
then probe all possible intensities imbalance. This averaging procedure mainly aﬀects the ﬁnal atomic velocity and
induces an inhomogeneous broadening of the Doppler velocity distribution. The impact on the ﬁnal temperature is
more severe than in the small ζ regime. This is evidenced by our experimental data which mostly lie in the large ζ
regime. It is however possible, in principle, to reach the small ζ regime by appropriately reducing the intensities of
the cooling beams and get ﬁnal temperatures closer to the Doppler limit.

The cooling dynamics also exhibits an unusual behavior in the large ζ regime : the atoms are ﬁrst cooled down
before being heated up. This speciﬁc feature is also found in our experiments, thus conﬁrming the central role of
transverse intensity ﬂuctuations in Doppler cooling.

The typical intensity dispersion is roughly 10% of the total signal. Figure (b) shows the spatial ﬂuctuations correlation function
C(x) vs a transverse coordinate. The transverse distance at which this correlation function vanishes deﬁnes the correlation
length ξs. Experimentally we found ξs ≃ 30 µm (diamonds). The oscillation on top of the decay is due to the interference
generated by the front window of the CCD camera. The fast decrease observed at short distances is also present when the laser
is oﬀ (crosses). This fast decrease is thus due to the uncorrelated noise on the CCD camera and corresponds to the pixel size.

short correlation time (τs = 1.25 µs) ; (b) intermediate correlation time (τs = 125 µs) ; (c) long correlation time (τs = 1250 µs).
The transverse velocity dispersion is ∆v⊥ = 0.8m/s, the mean saturation per beam is s0 = 0.04 and the saturation ﬂuctuation
parameter is rs = 9%. The dashed exponential decay is the bare Doppler prediction (see text).

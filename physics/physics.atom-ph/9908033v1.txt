Second-order [O(k2), k = ω/c] nondipole eﬀects in soft-x-ray photoemission are demonstrated
via an experimental and theoretical study of angular distributions of neon valence photoelectrons
in the 100–1200 eV photon-energy range. A newly derived theoretical expression for nondipolar
angular distributions characterizes the second-order eﬀects using four new parameters with primary
contributions from pure-quadrupole and octupole-dipole interference terms. Independent-particle
calculations of these parameters account for a signiﬁcant portion of the existing discrepancy between
experiment and theory for Ne 2p ﬁrst-order nondipole parameters.

A mainstay of photoemission is the (electric-)dipole ap-
proximation (DA), in which all higher-order multipoles
are neglected [1]. The range of validity of the DA has
received renewed interest as recent experiments [2,3] un-
covered breakdowns at progressively lower photon ener-
gies. At high energies (¯hω >5 keV), breakdown of the
DA in photoionization is well-known, and a proper de-
scription requires inclusion of many multipoles [4]. For
soft-x-ray (¯hω <5 keV) photoionization, in contrast, ﬁrst-
order [O(k)] corrections to the DA generally have been
considered suﬃcient [5]. At these relatively low ener-
gies, DA breakdown primarily leads to forward/backward
asymmetries in photoelectron angular-distribution pat-
terns. Especially striking have been observations of
nondipole eﬀects at energies below 1 keV [3], a region
in which the DA is usually considered valid.
In the
present work, an experimental and theoretical analysis
of neon valence photoemission demonstrates a new, and
unexpected, breakdown: signiﬁcant second-order [O(k2)]
nondipole eﬀects, primarily due to electric-octupole and
pure-electric-quadrupole interactions, in low-energy pho-
toemission.

We begin with Cooper’s O(k) formula for the diﬀeren-
tial photoionization cross section of a subshell (n, κ) in
a randomly oriented target using linearly polarized light
[6]:

where σnκ is the photoionization cross section, βnκ de-
scribes the angular distribution within the DA, and δnκ
and γnκ are nondipole angular-distribution parameters
characterizing the leading ﬁrst-order corrections to the
E1 terms). The angles θ and φ are
DA (mostly E2
determined by the direction of the photoelectron relative
to the photon-polarization ˆǫ and photon-propagation k
directions, respectively. The ﬁrst two terms on the right
of Eq. (1) constitute the usual DA expression for the dif-
ferential cross section, and the DA notion of a ”magic
angle” [θm = 54.7◦, P2(cos θm) = 0] is preserved only in
the φ = 90◦ plane perpendicular to k.

−

At this level of approximation, recent rare-gas ex-
periments [2,3] observed signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of
photoelectron angular distributions from DA expec-
tations, generally in good agreement with ﬁrst-order
independent-particle-approximation (IPA) calculations
[6,7]. The only exception is Ne 2p [3]; while measured
values of γ2s (δ2s is negligible when β2s = 2) agree fairly
well with calculations, measured values of the combined
parameter ζ2p (= 3δ2p + γ2p) are 30% larger than IPA
predictions for energies near 1 keV.

The same experiment also found β2p disagrees substan-
tially with IPA calculations in this energy region, but is
in close agreement with correlated calculations using the

random-phase approximation (RPA) [8,9], thereby iden-
tifying important electron-correlation eﬀects well above
the n = 2 thresholds [10]. This result led to speculation
[3] the discrepancy between measured and IPA-calculated
ζ2p values might also be due to interchannel-coupling ef-
fects. However, subsequent ﬁrst-order nondipole calcu-
lations including electron correlation [11] disproved this
notion; RPA values of Ne ζ2p are in excellent agreement
with the uncorrelated IPA results [6,7].

In this work, we explain much of this discrepancy be-
tween theory and experiment for Ne ζ2p. Beginning with
theory, second-order [O(k2)] corrections to the diﬀeren-
tial cross section, which arise from interferences between
E1
M1, and
E2, E2

E1 amplitudes, are
from retardation corrections to E1

where the O(k2)-parameters ∆β, η, µ, and ξ are intro-
duced [12]. Three of them satisfy the constraint η + µ +
ξ = 0. Reference [12] contains complete formulae and a
tabulation of ﬁrst- and second-order parameters for all
subshells of the rare gases helium to xenon.

For experiment, we ﬁrst present results for Ne γ2s and
ζ2p determined assuming only ﬁrst-order corrections, em-
bodied in δ and γ, are needed to correctly interpret the
data. The experiments were performed with an appara-
tus designed to measure deviations from the DA [13]; γ2s
and ζ2p are determined using angle-resolved photoemis-
sion intensities at θm and both φ = 0◦ and φ = 90◦.
Figure 1 compiles old [3] and new values for ζ2p and
γ2s (open squares) determined in this way. The solid
curves represent O(k) calculations [6,7,11], which agree
well with the 2s results, but disagree with the 2p results
above 800 eV.

To obtain O(k2) predictions (dotted curves in Fig. 1),
we ﬁrst carried out numerical IPA studies of second-order
corrections for neon. Wavefunctions for bound-state and
continuum electrons were obtained from the radial Dirac
equation in a modiﬁed Hartree potential. Values for all
n = 2 angular-distribution parameters were calculated
up to 2 keV. Our results for γ2s and ζ2p are in excel-
lent agreement with previous nonrelativistic IPA calcu-
lations [6]. Figure 2 shows values for ∆β, η, and µ
(ξ =
µ) obtained from our second-order IPA calcu-
lations. Primary contributions to these parameters come
from E1
E2 terms, with the octupole term
contributing about 65% at 1 keV. A smaller contribution
10%) comes from the E1

using the notation σ(θ, φ) = dσ
dΩ (θ, φ). Using the results
in Fig. 2, ζeﬀ for 2p and γeﬀ for 2s can be determined and
compared to the results in Fig. 1 to identify inﬂuences of
second-order nondipole eﬀects. (We stress the measure-
ments are ﬁne, only the assumptions behind their analy-
sis are suspect.) This exercise yields the dotted curves in
Fig. 1, providing excellent agreement with γ2s and clearly
improved agreement with ζ2p. The second-order correc-
tions contained in ζeﬀ account for much of the diﬀerence
between the ﬁrst-order theory and experiment for ζ2p,
demonstrating the ﬁrst observation of O(k2) eﬀects in
soft-x-ray photoemission.

To conﬁrm this unexpected ﬁnding, we made addi-
tional measurements with our apparatus, which contains
four electron analyzers in a chamber which can rotate
about the photon beam. At a nominal angular position,
two analyzers are at θm and θ = 0◦ in the plane perpen-
dicular to the photon beam (φ = 90◦), which we refer to
as the dipole plane because ﬁrst-order corrections vanish,
while the other analyzers are positioned on the 35.3◦ cone
in the forward direction with respect to the photon beam,
with one of them at θm and φ = 0◦. Photoemission in-
tensities in the magic-angle analyzers are independent of
β and can diﬀer only because of nondipole eﬀects. While
the magic angle is no longer strictly valid when second-
order eﬀects are included, calculations show they can be
unimportant in certain geometries (see below).

New measurements were performed at ten rotational
positions, yielding 20 angle-resolved intensities for Ne 2s
and 2p photoemission at diﬀerent angles θ within the
dipole plane, and 20 more at diﬀerent angles θ and φ
around the nondipole cone. From the calculated results
for ∆β2p in Fig. 2, direct second-order eﬀects on β2p
should be insigniﬁcant; ∆β2p
0.005 near 1 keV, much
smaller than our measurement uncertainties. Therefore,
values of β2p determined from the dipole-plane spectra
should agree well with DA calculations, if eﬀects due to
η, µ, and ξ are negligible in the dipole plane. Using
Fig. 2, the inﬂuence of these parameters on angle-resolved
photoemission intensities can be predicted. In the dipole
plane, we predict their eﬀects will mostly cancel, and thus
the excellent agreement [10] between experiment and the-
ory for β2p is not surprising.

≈

In the nondipole cone, inﬂuences of the second-order
parameters are superimposed on intensity variations due
to the dipole β and the ﬁrst-order δ and γ parameters.

However, for both 2s and 2p, our calculations predict
eﬀects due to η, µ, and ξ also mostly cancel around
the nondipole cone. Furthermore, small residual eﬀects
around this cone are similar in sign and magnitude for
2s and 2p, which is relevant because intensity ratios are
the raw input for data analysis. Assuming no inﬂuence
of second-order eﬀects in the nondipole cone, we mod-
eled the measured 2s/2p ratios around this cone using
Eq. (1) to derive values for γ2s and ζ2p. These results
(solid circles in Fig. 1) agree extremely well with ﬁrst-
order calculations [6,7,11], conﬁrming our prediction of
near cancellation of second-order eﬀects in this geome-
try.

The above conﬁrmation tests include two independent
experimental methods to determine γ2s and ζ2p: one re-
lies on measurements at many angles in the nondipole
cone, the other relies on comparison of magic-angle-only
measurements in the dipole plane and the nondipole cone.
For the former, second-order eﬀects mostly vanish. For
the latter, in contrast, the inﬂuences of η, µ, and ξ on
Ne 2p photoemission are expected to be opposite in sign
for φ = 0◦ and φ = 90◦, because of the cos(2φ) terms in
Eq. (2). Thus, second-order eﬀects should be observable
with the latter method, hence the diﬀerences in values
for ζ2p derived using the two methods.

As a demonstration of the inﬂuence of second-order
nondipole eﬀects on angle-resolved-photoemission inten-
sities, Fig. 3 compares spectra taken with the two magic-
angle analyzers. Figure 3a contains a neon photoemission
spectrum taken at ¯hω=1200 eV, θm, and φ = 90◦ in the
dipole plane, where inﬂuences of β, δ, and γ vanish. In-
cluded are ﬁt curves showing modeled peak shapes and
photoemission satellites to the left of the 2s peak. The
overall ﬁt (solid curve) matches the data very well, as
indicated by the residual in Fig. 3b.

This spectrum and ﬁt are reproduced in Fig. 3c and
compared to a nondipole-cone spectrum at 1200 eV, θm,
and φ = 0◦. Intensity normalization between the spectra
was achieved using γ2s from Fig. 1, for which experiment
and theory agree well. By inspection, the 2s/2p ratio is
diﬀerent in the two spectra. One possible explanation
is a diﬀerential inﬂuence of ﬁrst-order nondipole eﬀects
on the 2s and 2p intensities. As a quantitative test of
this hypothesis, we derived the dotted region in Fig. 3c
by multiplying the ﬁt to the 2p peak in the dipole-plane
spectrum by the expected diﬀerential eﬀect on 2s and 2p
peak intensities in the nondipole-cone spectrum deter-
mined from IPA-/RPA-predicted values for γ2s and ζ2p
(see Eq. (1)). If ﬁrst-order eﬀects alone explain the ob-
served variation of the 2s/2p ratio, then the dotted region
should coincide with the 2p peak in the nondipole-cone
spectrum. It does not, and thus the diﬀerence between
10%) is
the dotted region and the open-circle data (
attributed to the inﬂuence of second-order eﬀects.

Abstract

This thesis describes the observation and study of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
of magnetically trapped atomic hydrogen. The sample is cooled by magnetic sad-
dlepoint and radio frequency evaporation and is studied by laser spectroscopy of the
1S-2S transition in both the Doppler-free and Doppler-sensitive conﬁguration. A
cold collision frequency shift is exploited to infer the density of both the condensate
and the non-condensed fraction of the sample. Condensates containing 109 atoms
1010 atoms. The small equilibrium
are observed in trapped samples containing 5
condensate fractions are understood to arise from the very small repulsive interac-
tion energy among the condensate atoms and the low evaporative cooling rate, both
related to hydrogen’s anomalously small ground state s-wave scattering length. Loss
from the condensate by dipolar spin-relaxation is counteracted by replenishment from
the non-condensed portion of the sample, allowing condensates to exist more than
15 s. A simple computer model of the degenerate system agrees well with the data.
The large condensates and much larger thermal reservoirs should be very useful for
the creation of bright coherent atomic beams. Several experiments to improve and
utilize the condensates are suggested.

×

Attainment of BEC in hydrogen required application of the rf evaporation tech-
nique in order to overcome ineﬃciencies associated with one-dimensional evaporation
over the magnetic ﬁeld saddlepoint which conﬁnes the sample axially. The cryogenic
apparatus (100 mK) had to be redesigned to accomodate the rf ﬁelds of many milli-
gauss strength. This required the removal of good electrical conductors from the cell,
and the use of a superﬂuid liquid helium jacket for heat transport. Measurements of
heat transport and rf ﬁeld strength are presented.

The rf ﬁelds in the apparatus allow rf ejection spectroscopy to be used to measure

the trap minimum as well as the temperature of the sample.

This thesis is dedicated to Jesus Christ, who I understand to be the One who created
quantum mechanics, and indeed all of physics and the whole of the entire universe.
The extremely rich and subtle complexity of the physical world, and that of quantum
systems such as dilute gases at low temperatures and high densities in particular, give
me reason to worship Him as an amazing intelligence with creativity and complexity
much farther beyond the grasp of the human mind than the physics described in this
thesis is beyond the grasp of my sister-in-law’s golden retriever. As I understand
it, our Creator’s deep love for us has caused Him to initiate relationship with us,
a relationship that has implications far beyond our activities here. For this, too, I
worship Him and give to Him my loyalty. He is the King of the Universe.

Having gratefully acknowledged the Inventor of the physics studied in this thesis, I
also gratefully acknowledge my parents, Ray and Twyla, and my brother, Glenn, who
patiently but thoroughly instilled in me a pleasure in working hard, a curiosity about
the world, a self-conﬁdence that has allowed me to take risks. Their encouragement
and interest during my graduate work has been unwavering, a crucial help when I
myself was wavering.

As Daniel Kleppner says, one of the important roles of a thesis advisor is to ask a
good question. He and my other advisor, Thomas Greytak, have done this superbly.
I am grateful to both of them for allowing me to work in their research group and for
supporting me ﬁnancially. Their intellectual commitment to the research and their
personal commitment to me as a student have made my years at MIT a pleasure.

Much of a graduate education comes through one’s co-workers, and much of the
pleasure comes through the camaraderie and friendship in the research group. I am
fortunate to have worked with many world-class colleagues during my time at MIT.
Mike Yoo, my ﬁrst oﬃce mate, helped me learn practical skills, such as program-
ming “makeﬁles”, and also helped me shoulder responsibilities with conﬁdence. His
cheerful insights into graduate student life helped take the edge oﬀ all night problem
sets.

John Doyle, a postdoc when I started in the group, taught me the power of back
of the envelope calculations and modeled a systematic, bold approach to solving
problems. He has been a continuing encouragement during my graduate career.

Jon Sandberg’s helpful ability to teach me the basics of the experiment planted
the seed in my head that one day I would be able to run the experiment, too. His
conﬁdence in the “younger generation” has helped me push through times of discour-
agement.

Albert Yu’s cheerily optimistic “there is no problem which cannot be solved” has
been my rallying cry more than once. Albert’s friendship is typiﬁed by generous
hospitality, including one night when he met me after I was mugged on the subway.
Claudio Cesar contributed a contagious creativity to the experiment, and a fun
demeanor to life in the lab. His optimism and encouragement helped me move toward
more of a leadership position. His friendship has helped me maintain perspective.

Adam Polcyn joined the experiment the same year I did. Beginning with the
ﬁnding that our tastes in used books were compatible, I have enjoyed my friendship

with him immensely. I often rely on him for reality checks both in my physics and in
life.

Thomas Killian has been my primary colleague over the most recent several years
of work. I learned an intellectual thoroughness from his agile and deep approach to
physics. His excitement and engagement with the experiment has made long nights
in the lab fruitful and enjoyable.

David Landhuis joined the group more recently. His work to rigorously understand
physics is very welcome, as is his cheerful willingness to carry out thankless lab chores
such as being the safety oﬃcer. Dave’s friendship makes work in the lab a pleasure.
Stephen Moss, my new oﬃce mate, also brings a tenacious quest for deep under-
standing to the experiment. His sense of humor, humility, and ﬂexibility are much
appreciated. His friendship signiﬁcantly adds to the fun of working in this research
group.

Lorenz Willmann, who joined the group two years ago as a postdoc, has taught me
about experiment documentation and data analysis. His calm manner has brought a
broader perspective to problems that loomed large in my thinking.

I am conﬁdent of a bright future for this experiment in the capable hands of Dave,

Stephen, and Lorenz.

Finally, I wish to thank my wife, Diana, for marrying me and giving me her love.
I met her three years ago at a French abbey on Easter, while traveling after a physics
conference at Les Houches in the French Alps. She has made the last three years
of my life meaningful and joyful. I am deeply grateful for her patience and sacriﬁce
during the sometimes long days and nights I have spent in the lab.

Introduction

1.1 The Lure of Bose-Einstein Condensation

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a dilute gas has been a very important goal
since the beginning of experimental research on spin-polarized atomic hydrogen. The
original intent [1] was to study quantum phase transition behavior and search for
superﬂuidity in this dilute gas, a weakly interacting system that is much more the-
oretically tractable than strongly interacting degenerate quantum systems such as
superﬂuid liquid 4He. This phase transition is a purely quantum mechanical eﬀect,
and, unlike all other phase transitions, it occurs in the absence of any interparticle
interactions.

Although the search for BEC in dilute gases began in spin-polarized hydrogen,
the ﬁrst observations of the eﬀect used dilute gases of the alkali metal atoms Rb
[2], Na [3], and Li [4, 5] in the summer of 1995. The properties of hydrogen that
were so attractive in the beginning turned out, in the end, to be irrelevant or even
a hindrance. Nevertheless, we have ﬁnally observed BEC in hydrogen [6, 7].
In
several ways our hydrogen condensates are rather diﬀerent from those of the alkalis,
and we use diﬀerent techniques to probe the sample. Hydrogen thus contributes
signiﬁcantly to the extraordinary ﬂurry of experimental activity creating and probing
Bose condensates, and applying them to intriguing new areas.

The formation of a Bose condensate out of a gas can be studied as the occurrence
of a quantum mechanical phase transition, but perhaps even more interesting are
the properties of the condensate itself. Centered in the middle of a trapped gas,
this collection of atoms exhibits such bizarre eﬀects as a vanishingly small kinetic
energy, long range coherence across the condensate [8], a single macroscopic quantum
state, immiscibilty of two components of a gas [9, 10], and constructive/destructive
interference between atoms that have fallen many millimeters out of the cloud [11].
These systems hold promise for creating quantum entanglement of huge numbers of
atoms for use in quantum computing and vastly improved fundamental measurements.

1.2 The Signiﬁcance of the Work in this Thesis

In this thesis we describe the culmination of a 22 year research eﬀort: the ﬁrst ob-
servations of BEC in hydrogen1. Furthermore, we demonstrate a new technique of
probing Bose condensates, optical spectroscopy. This tool allows us to measure the
density and momentum distributions of the sample, and thus infer the temperature,
size of the condensate, and other properties. We ﬁnd that the condensates we create
contain nearly two orders of magnitude more atoms than other BEC systems, and
the condensates occupy a much larger volume. In addition, we ﬁnd that nearly 1010
atoms are condensed during the 10 s lifetime of the condensate. This high ﬂux of
condensate atoms implies that this system might be ideal for creation of bright, co-
herent atomic beams. Indeed, hydrogen has proven to be a rich and promising atom
for further studies of BEC.

The thesis is divided as follows. Chapter 2 and the associated appendices provide
a detailed description of the behavior of the trapped gas both in the classical and
quantum mechanical regimes. Results are obtained to guide the reader’s intuition
throughout the remainder of the thesis. Chapter 3 describes changes to the apparatus
that allowed BEC to be achieved. Chapter 4 details use of the new capabilities of
the improved apparatus. The most important contributions described in this thesis
are found in chapter 5 where studies of BEC are presented. Finally, conclusions and
suggestions for future work are made in chapter 6.

Much of the work described here was done in close collaboration with a group of
people, as shown by the several names on our papers. In particular, this thesis should
be considered a companion thesis to that of Thomas Killian [13]. Both should be
read to obtain a complete picture of the whole experiment. The work builds on ear-
lier work by Claudio Cesar, whose thesis [14] describes the ﬁrst 1S-2S spectroscopy
of trapped atomic hydrogen; Albert Yu, whose thesis [15] on universal quantum re-
ﬂection includes important insights into non-ergodic atomic motion in the trap; Jon
Sandberg, whose thesis [16] describes the physics of 1S-2S spectroscopy in a trap and
the development of the uv laser system we use; and John Doyle, whose thesis [17]
describes trapping and cooling of spin-polarized hydrogen and the magnet system we
use to trap the gas.

1.3 The Basics of Trapping and Cooling Hydrogen

There is a long and interesting history of spin-polarized hydrogen in the laboratory,
summarized well by Greytak [18]. Here we brieﬂy summarize our method of creating
spin-polarized hydrogen, loading it into a trap, and cooling it to BEC (quantum
degeneracy). A broader description is in the thesis of Killian [13].

Hydrogen is composed of a proton and electron, whose spins can couple in four
ways: the four hyperﬁne states are labeled a-d (these states are derived in section

1A two dimensional analog of BEC has been observed very recently in atomic hydrogen conﬁned

to a surface of liquid 4He [12]

16

Figure 1-1: Hyperﬁne-Zeeman diagram of ground state atomic hydrogen. The eigen-
states of the combined hyperﬁne and Zeeman Hamiltonian are described in section
3.1. Atoms in states c and d can be trapped in a magnetic ﬁeld minimum.

3.1.1). The high-ﬁeld seeking states (a and b) are pulled toward regions of high
magnetic ﬁeld, and the low-ﬁeld seeking states (c and d) are expelled from high ﬁeld
regions. Figure 1-1 shows the energies of the four states as a function of ﬁeld strength.
Our experiments use the pure, doubly-polarized d-state.

At the beginning of an experimental run molecular hydrogen is loaded into the
cryogenic apparatus by blowing a mixture of H2 and 4He into a cold (T
1 K)
can, called the dissociator, where it freezes. Then, for each loading of the trap, H2
molecules are dissociated by pulsing an rf discharge (the dissociator is in a region
of high magnetic ﬁeld, 4 T). The low ﬁeld seekers are blown into a conﬁnement cell
(4 cm diameter, 60 cm length), over which the inhomogeneous trapping ﬁeld is super-
imposed. The trap ﬁelds are created by currents in superconducting coils, described
by Doyle [17] and Sandberg [16]. The coils create a trap with maximum depth 0.82 T,
which, for hydrogen’s magnetic moment of 1 Bohr magneton, corresponds to an en-
ergy ǫt/kB = 550 mK. (See appendix I for conversions between various manifestations
of energy in this experiment.) The trap depth is the diﬀerence between the ﬁeld at
the walls of the containment cell and the minimum ﬁeld in the middle of the cell.
There are seventeen independently controlled coils in the apparatus which are used
to adjust the trap shape. Figure 1-2 is a cutaway diagram of the system. Expanded
views of the top and bottom of the cell are in ﬁgures 3-8 and 3-9. The trap shape
used for capturing the atoms is basically a long trough. The ﬁeld increases linearly

17

Figure 1-2: Cutaway view of apparatus. Molecular hydrogen is dissociated in an rf
discharge in a 4 tesla region. The atoms move into the conﬁnement cell which has
superimposed on it a trap, created by the quadrupole coils (radial conﬁnement) and
the pinch coils (axial conﬁnement). The coils are bathed in 4.2 K liquid helium. The
cell is centered in the vacuum can with three Kevlar strings. It is thermally anchored
to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator (not shown). The laser beam passes
through the upper window, retroreﬂects on the mirror at the bottom of the cell, and
exits through the upper window. Atomic ﬂuorescence photons pass through the MgF
window and Lyman-α ﬁlter, and are counted on the microchannel plate detector.

18

away from the z axis of the trap (the potential exhibits near cylindrical symmetry
about the z axis); the potential is small and roughly uniform for about 20 cm along
the z axis. “Pinch” coils at each end provide the axial conﬁnement. The ﬁeld proﬁle
indicated in ﬁgure 1-2 is along the z axis of the cell.

The trap depth sets an energy scale: for atoms to be trapped their total energy
must be less than the trap depth. Two techniques are used to cool the atoms into the
trap. First, after H2 molecules are dissociated [17, 19] the hot atoms are thermalized
on the walls of the cell, held at 275 mK. In order to prevent the atoms from sticking
tightly to the cold surfaces, a superﬂuid 4He ﬁlm covers the walls and reduces the
binding energy of the H atoms to a manageable 1.0 K [20, 21, 22]. When the atoms
leave the wall their total energy (3kBT /2 of kinetic energy and ǫt of potential energy)
is still greater than the trap depth. The second stage of cooling into the trap involves
collisions among the atoms that are crossing the trapping region. Sometimes these
collisions result in one atom having low enough energy to become trapped. The
partner atom in the collision goes to the wall and is thermalized. The gas densities
expected in the cell correspond to a collision length many times greater than the cell
diameter, so atoms pass through the trapping region many times before becoming
trapped. A recent study of the trap loading process will be published elsewhere [19].
After loading the trap, the cell walls are quickly cooled to below 150 mK to ther-
mally disconnect the sample from the conﬁnement cell. At these lower temperatures
the residence time of an atom on the surface of the cell becomes much longer than the
H2 recombination time, and so the surface is “sticky”; all the
characteristic H+H
atoms that reach the surface recombine before having a chance to leave the surface.
Thermal disconnect between the cryogenic cell and the trapped sample is achieved
because no warm particles can leave the walls and carry energy to the trapped gas.
Atoms can leave the trapped gas and reach the wall, however, if they have large
enough total energy to climb the magnetic hill. As these very energetic atoms irre-
versibly leave the trapped sample, it cools. In fact, this preferential removal of the
most energetic atoms, called evaporation, is very useful. It is the cooling mechanism
we exploit to create samples as cold as 20 µK, as described in chapter 5. A thorough
description of the heating and cooling processes which set the temperature of the
system is found in appendix A.

→

We catch both the d and c low ﬁeld seeking states in the trap. However, inelastic
collision processes involving two c state atoms quickly deplete the c-state population,
and the remaining atoms constitute a doubly polarized sample (both electron and
proton spins are polarized). Because the spin state is pure, the spin-relaxation rate
3 (nearly the
is rather small. For peak densities in the normal gas of n
largest for these experiments) the characteristic decay time is 40 s.

1014 cm−

The trapped gas is probed using various techniques. The simplest method involves
quickly lowering the magnetic conﬁnement barrier at one end of the trap, and mea-
suring the ﬂux of escaping atoms as a function of barrier height [17, 23]. In a limited
regime this technique can be used to infer the gas temperature and density. This tech-
nique, and its limitations, is described in chapter 4. Another technique is rf ejection
spectroscopy, described in chapter 4. The third probe technique is laser spectroscopy
of the 1S-2S transition, envisioned [24, 16], realized [14, 25], and perfected [13] in our

19

lab for a trapped gas. This diagnostic tool can give the density and temperature of
the gas over a wider range of operating conditions than the other techniques, and has
proven crucial for studies of BEC. The laser probe will be described in more detail in
chapter 5, and is a principle subject of the companion thesis by Killian [13].

Chapter 2

Theoretical Considerations

This chapter addresses two important topics from a theoretical perspective. First, we
explain why previous experiments could not bring trapped hydrogen into the quantum
degenerate regime. This understanding allowed us to solve the problem and achieve
BEC. The second topic is related to the small fraction (only a few percent) of atoms
we are able to put into the condensate. This situation diﬀers markedly from that
observed in Rb and Na BEC experiments. An explanation of this diﬀerence and
others is the second topic we explore theoretically.

The starting point for understanding the behavior of the trapped gas is classical
statistical mechanics. Good explanations have been developed elsewhere [26, 27, 17,
28]. For completeness, we present a development in appendix A. Since the gas
exists in a trap of ﬁnite depth ǫt, we use a truncated Maxwell-Boltzmann occupation
function. Knowledge of the trap shape allows us to calculate the population, total
energy, density, etc. The eﬀects of truncation of the energy distribution at the trap
depth are included in these derivations. We see that for deep traps (η
ǫt/kBT > 7)
the truncation does not signiﬁcantly alter the properties of the system from estimates
based on an untruncated distribution. Appendix A also explains the density of states
functions (see section A.1.2) used in the remainder of the thesis and summarizes
evaporative cooling (see section A.2).

≡

2.1 Dimensionality of Evaporation

The temperature of the gas is set by a balance between heating and cooling processes,
as described in section A.2.2. Previous attempts to attain BEC in hydrogen [29, 30]
failed because the cooling process became bottlenecked by the slow rate at which
energetic atoms could escape, thus reducing the eﬀective cooling rate. To understand
this bottleneck we must ﬁrst consider the details of the trap shape. We then study
the motion of the particles that have enough energy to escape.

The trap shape used to conﬁne samples at T < 200 µK is often called the “Ioﬀe-
Pritchard” [31, 26] type (labeled “IP”). Using axial coordinate z and radial coordinate

21

with radial potential energy gradient α (units energy/length), axial potential energy
curvature 2β (units of energy/length2), and bias potential energy θ. See section A.1.2
for a summary of the density of states functions for this trap.

In the limit of ρ

For the evaporation to proceed eﬃciently, atoms with energy greater than the
trap depth ǫt (called “energetic atoms”) must leave the trap promptly, before having
a collision. As shown in appendix B, in the vast majority of cases an energetic atom
that collides with a trapped atom will become trapped again. The rare collision that
produced the energetic atom will be “wasted”. It is essential to understand the details
of the particle removal process if maximum evaporation eﬃciency is to be achieved.
Previous attempts to cool hydrogen to BEC utilized “saddlepoint evaporation”,
in which energetic atoms escape over a saddlepoint in the magnetic ﬁeld barrier at
one end of the trap. To escape, the atom must have energy in the axial degree of
freedom (z) that is greater than ǫt. This atom removal technique is inherently one
dimensional. The collisions which drive evaporation produce many atoms with high
energy in the radial degrees of freedom, and in order for these to escape the energy
must be transferred to the axial degree of freedom. This energy transfer process was
analyzed theoretically by Surkov, Walraven, and Shlyapnikov [32], and we follow their
analysis.

22

In a harmonic trap the potential is separable, and the particle motion is com-
pletely regular; no energy exchange occurs.
In the Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap, however,
energy exchange can occur because the potential is not separable; the radial oscilla-
tion frequency depends on the axial coordinate, z, and so radial motion can couple
to axial motion. (See equation 2.5.)

This energy mixing can be understood by considering how rapidly the radial oscil-
lation frequency changes as an atom moves along the z axis. If the frequency changes
slowly (“adiabatically”), then the energy will not mix among the degrees of freedom.
The adiabaticity parameter is the fractional change of the radial oscillation frequency
in one oscillation period as the atom moves axially through the trap. Strong mixing
occurs when

We see that several factors contribute to good mixing: large axial velocity vz (which
occurs at high temperature), small radial gradient α, small bias ﬁeld θ, and large
axial curvature β. In practice, however, achieving BEC requires low temperatures
(vz small) and high densities (obtained with large compressions, and thus large α).
Consequently, the degrees of freedom do not mix and evaporation becomes essen-
tially one dimensional. Typical values for our experiment are α/kB = 16 mK/cm,
β/kB = 25 µK/cm2, θ/kB = 30 µK, T = 100 µK, z
2 cm, and vz = 140 cm/s, so

energy, but there are only about ωρ/2πΓcol ∼
200 oscillations per collision for a peak
sample density n0 = 1014 cm−
3 (Γcol is the elastic collision rate, p121). There is not
enough time to transfer the radial energy to axial energy before the particle has a col-
lision. The energy mixing is thus very weak and the evaporation is one dimensional.
Surkov et al. [32] pointed out the consequences of one-dimensional evaporation. They
estimated that the eﬃciency is reduced by a factor of 4η compared to that of full 3D
evaporation. The evaporative cooling power thus drops dramatically. Experiments
in our laboratory (unpublished) have conﬁrmed that phase space compression ceases
near 100 µK. These results were duplicated and studied in more depth by Pinkse et
al. [30].

∼

In order to maintain the evaporation eﬃciency a technique is required that quickly
removes all particles with energy greater than the trap depth. To this end we imple-
mented rf evaporation, as described in detail in chapter 3.

2.2 Degenerate Bose Gas

23

2.2.1 Bose Distribution

The statistical mechanical description of a classical gas, presented in appendix A,
is not correct when quantum eﬀects are important. A simple way to understand
the crossover to the quantum regime is to recall that particles are characterized by
wavepackets whose size is related to their momentum by the Heisenberg momentum-
position uncertainty relation. As a gas is cooled, the particle momenta decrease,
and the wavepackets enlarge. The classical (point-particle) description of the system
breaks down when these wavepackets begin to overlap. The quantum treatment cor-
rectly deals with the eﬀect of particle indistinguishability. There are many excellent
treatments of quantum statistical mechanics [33]. Here we review the basic features
that are important for our experiment.

A collection of identical particles with integer (half-integer) spins must have a total
wavefunction that is symmetric (anti-symmetric) when two particles are exchanged.
The connection between spin and symmetry has been explained using relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theory [34]. Particles with integer (half-integer) spin are called bosons
(fermions). In contrast to fermions, multiple bosons may occupy a single quantum
state.

The occupation function for a gas of N identical bosons in a box of volume V , and
but constant N/V , is called the Bose-Einstein

The physical interpretation of these parameters is that µ is the chemical potential
and T is the temperature. Figure 2-1 shows the energy distribution of the population
in the trap for a classical gas described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution
and for a quantum gas described by the Bose-Einstein (BE) distribution. The two
functions shown describe systems with identical peak densities, a parameter relevant
to the creation of a condensate. The MB distribution requires many more particles
than the BE to create the same peak density because the atoms are distributed at
higher energies, further from the center of the trap.

The diﬀerence between the BE and MB distributions originates in the diﬀerent
assumptions about particle distinguishability. To intuitively understand this, we con-
sider the outcome of these diﬀering assumptions for sparsely and densely occupied
sets of energy states. In the classical treatment there are many ways to arrange the
distinguishable particles among sparsely occupied energy states because interchang-
ing any pair of particles leads to a diﬀerent arrangement. For very densely occupied

states, interchanges of distinguishable particles often result in the same arrangement
because the particles often do not change energy level. For a collection of distinguish-
able particles with a given total energy, there are “extra” arrangements in which
the particles are sparsely distributed. In contrast, for indistinguishable particles any
interchange of two particles results in the same overall arrangement of particles, re-
gardless of whether the states are sparsely or densely occupied. There are thus no
“extra” sparse arrangements of particles.

ranges from dense (
the assumption of equal a priori probabilities [33], distinguishable particles will most
likely be found in those arrangements with the more sparse level occupations (higher
Indistin-
overall energies) because there are so many more of these arrangements.
guishable particles give no rise to such “extra” arrangements, and so the most likely
arrangements will involve more dense level occupations (lower overall energies) than
predicted by classical theory. Figure 2-1 demonstrates this eﬀect. For each pair of
curves the peak density, n0, is identical. The peak density is the experimentally ob-
servable quantity. Since the MB occupation function favors arrangements with higher
energy (and thus atoms are distributed over a larger volume in the trap), more atoms
are required in the sample to produce the same peak density. The curves thus do not
exhibit equal area.

Bose-Einstein condensation occurs when the chemical potential goes to zero and
the occupation of the lowest energy state diverges. This occurs at the critical density

Although a hydrogen atom consists of two fermions, it behaves like a composite
boson for the studies in this thesis because the collision interaction energies are ex-
tremely small compared to the electron-proton binding energy [35]. The two fermions
act as a unit except in high energy collisions where electron exchange is possible. The
typical interaction energy during low temperature collisions is
1 mK, which corre-
7 eV, 108 times smaller than the binding energy.

To analyze the behavior of the degenerate Bose gas we shall separately treat the
condensed and non-condensed portions of the system. The condensate is treated
in section 2.2.2. The non-condensed fraction, which we call the “normal gas” or
“thermal gas”, is treated in appendix C. The results derived here will be used to
understand how the hydrogen system is diﬀerent from other gases that have been
Bose condensed (section 2.3), and to interpret the experimental results in chapter
5 (note that truncation eﬀects are important because of the shallow traps used for
those experiments, 4 < η < 6).

2.2.2 Description of the Condensate

2.2.2.1 Gross-Pitaevskii Equation

When Bose-Einstein condensation occurs, a macroscopic fraction of the particles oc-
cupy the lowest energy quantum state of the system, and thus have the same wave-
function. For a non-interacting Bose gas, that wavefunction is simply the lowest
harmonic oscillator wavefunction for the trap. Interactions become important when
many particles occupy this region of space and the local density increases. In this
case the wavefunction spreads out due to repulsion among the atoms. There is a large
body of literature on Bose-Einstein condensates (see [36] for a recent review), and so

26

we simply quote here the most important results.

The Schroedinger equation for the interacting condensate is called the Gross-

Pitaevskii equation [37, 38, 39], and has the form

¯h2
2m∇

−

2ψ(r) + V (r)ψ(r) + U0 |

|

ψ(r)

2 ψ(r) = µψ(r)

(2.12)

where ψ(r) is the condensate wavefunction to be determined. The eigenenergy of the
wavefunction is µ, which is the total energy of each condensate atom. The quantity
4π¯h2a/m parameterizes the mean ﬁeld energy, which is the energy of interaction
U0 ≡
among the atoms per unit density, and is repulsive for s-wave scattering lengths a > 0.
For hydrogen in the ground state, a = 0.648 ˚A[40], and U0/kB = 3.92
16 µK cm3.
The mean ﬁeld energy augments the trap potential by an amount proportional to
2. Note that interactions between the
the local condensate density ncond(r) =
ψ(r)
|
condensate and non-condensed atoms are neglected here. For the experiments in this
thesis, this interaction energy is small because the density of non-condensed atoms
(called the “thermal gas” or “normal gas”) is small. Furthermore, the interaction
energy with the thermal gas is essentially uniform across the condensate because
the density of non-condensed atoms varies only weakly; the thermal energy of the
normal gas (Tc ∼
60 µK) is much larger than the condensate mean ﬁeld energy
2 µK), and thus the density of the normal gas does not change appreciably
(µ/kB ∼
on the length scale of the condensate.

10−

|

We identify the eigenenergy µ in equation 2.12 with the chemical potential of the
system in equilibrium. The chemical potential is the energy required to add a particle
to the system. When a condensate is present, the normal gas is “saturated”, and any
particles added to the system go into the condensate. The energy required to add the
last atom to the condensate is µ, the eigenenergy, and so we link µ with the chemical
potential. In practice we measure µ spectroscopically through the peak density at
the center of the condensate, which is in turn measured through the cold-collision
frequency shift. This is explained in section 5.3.1.

2.2.2.2 Thomas-Fermi Approximation

If the condensate density is large enough so that the mean ﬁeld energy is much greater
than the kinetic energy of the wavefunction, then the kinetic energy term (also called
the quantum pressure term) in equation 2.12 may be neglected. Using this “Thomas-
Fermi” approximation we obtain the condensate density proﬁle

ncond(r) = np −

V (r)/U0

(2.13)

µ/U0 is the peak condensate density (the largest density in the condensate,
where np ≡
found at the bottom of the trap). The Thomas-Fermi approximation is valid over
most of the volume of the condensate, but near the edges the condensate density
approaches zero, and the kinetic energy term should be included. We ignore this
small correction in the calculations which follow because it is minor for interpretation
of the experiments described in this thesis. See [41] for a good description of various

27

ways to go beyond the Thomas-Fermi approximation.

The condensate density proﬁle may be obtained without the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation by assuming the condensate is stationary and its particles are at rest, and
then balancing hydrodynamic forces [42]. A condensate particle in a region of poten-
tial energy ε has total energy E = ε + ncond(ε)U0. Since there must be no net force
npU0 and ncond(ε) = np −
on the particle, E = const

2.2.2.3 Population and Loss Rate

The population of the condensate is easily computed using the Thomas-Fermi wave-
function in the bottom of the IP trap, which is parabolic for the condensate sizes
and trap parameters of interest in this thesis. We approximate the potential energy
density of states (see p114) as ̺(ε)

As noted above, the total energy of each condensate atom is the chemical potential

The loss rate from the condensate due to two-body dipolar relaxation is found by

2.3 Properties of a Bose-Condensed Gas of Hydro-

gen

Hydrogen diﬀers in several ways from alkali metal atoms that have been Bose con-
densed. The principal diﬀerences are its small mass and small s-wave scattering
length. How do these properties inﬂuence the system?

28

First, the small mass implies that BEC occurs at a higher temperature for a given
1/m. We have observed the transition at

peak density:
temperatures roughly 50 times higher than in the other systems.

from equation 2.11, Tc ∝

Further, as estimated by Hijmans et al. [45] and will be shown in the following
sections, the maximum equilibrium condensate fraction is small for hydrogen. This
will be explained by noting the relatively high density of the condensate, as compared
to the thermal cloud. This high density leads to high losses through dipolar decay,
which result in heating of the system. This heating must be balanced by evaporative
cooling, which proceeds slowly in hydrogen because of the small collision cross section.
The result of these factors is that only small condensate fractions are possible in
equilibrium. Possible remedies will be noted.

Finally, hydrogen’s small collision cross-section should allow condensates of H to
be produced by evaporative cooling that contain many orders of magnitude more
atoms than those possible in alkali-metal species, as explained in the section 2.3.4.

2.3.1 Relative Condensate Density

For trapped hydrogen, the condensate density grows much greater than the density
of the non-condensed portion of the gas at even very small condensate fractions [18],
a distinct diﬀerence from other species that have been Bose-condensed. This is note-
worthy for possible future studies of behavior near the phase transition. As shown in
section 2.3.2, it also has implications for the maximum condensate fraction that may
be achieved in hydrogen. In this section we calculate the ratio of the densities as a
function of the condensate fraction. We compare hydrogen to Li, Na, and Rb.

The condensate fraction is

where the population of the thermal cloud, Nt, is found using equation C.7 and the
population of the condensate is given by equation 2.14. The fraction can be written

The density ratio (for small condensate fractions) is the last column multiplied by the

loss process studied here becomes important.

The prefactor is R0 = 0.0457364. Table 2.1 gives the parameters appearing in equa-
tion 2.19 for the various BEC experiments. For even a small occupation ratio of
f = 0.05, the H condensate will be 28 times more dense than the thermal gas, which
can be compared to a Rb condensate that will be only be 1.3 times more dense. The
loss rates from the condensate are thus very diﬀerent for the two systems, as shown
in the next section. Note that the trap oscillation frequencies play no role in these re-
sults. The only assumptions are that the trap is of the IP form with bias ﬁeld1 φ, that

2.3.2 Achievable Condensate Fractions

The temperature of a trapped sample, and thus its condensate fraction, is set by a
competition between heating and cooling, as described in section A.2.1. Hydrogen’s
anomalously low scattering length means that the elastic collision rate is small, and
thus evaporation proceeds slowly. The evaporative cooling power is small, and the
heating-cooling balance favors higher temperatures and lower condensate fractions
than would occur if hydrogen had a larger collision cross section. Higher temperatures
are also favored by the large density of the condensate, which places an extra heat
load on the system due to dipolar relaxation. This extra heat load can easily be much
larger than the dipolar relaxation heat load of the thermal gas. In this section we

riences a predominantly linear potential in the radial direction. When φ is large, both condensate
and thermal gas experience the same potential functional form.

examine each of these factors in more detail.

We model the system as two components, the condensate and thermal gas, that
are strongly linked. As indicated in ﬁgure 2-2, losses from the system occur through
dipolar decay in the thermal gas, dipolar decay in the condensate, and evaporation
from the thermal cloud. We assume that particles and energy are exchanged between
the condensate and thermal gas quickly compared to all loss rates. The system is in
a dynamic equilibrium. In section 2.3.3 we examine the validity of the assumption of
fast feeding of the condensate.

2.3.2.1 Dipolar Heating Rate

Here we study the rate of heating the system due to dipolar decay in the condensate
and in the thermal gas. We deﬁne heating as the removal of atoms from the sample
which carry less than the average amount of energy per particle. We ﬁnd that for
hydrogen the condensate heat load exceeds the thermal gas heat load at condensate
fractions of 0.3%. We then compare this ratio for H to that of the atomic species in
other BEC experiments. While illustrative, this comparison is not completely appro-
priate because the loss mechanisms in the other systems are diﬀerent. Hydrodynamic
collapse of the Li condensate prevents it from growing larger than about 1000 atoms
in the experiments of Hulet et al. [5, 50]. Three-body loss process are dominant over
two-body dipolar decay in the Rb and Na experiments. The comparison made in this

31

section therefore serves simply to indicate how diﬀerent hydrogen is from the other
species.

The heating rate for a process (labeled σ), with energy and particle loss rates ˙Eσ
and ˙Nσ, is the diﬀerence between the average energy per particle in the system and
the energy per particle that is removed, multiplied by the rate at which particles are
removed:

condensate (Hc) and from the thermal cloud (Ht) as a function of the occupation
fraction f . Losses from the condensate play a signiﬁcant role in the trap dynamics

The heating rates are equal when f = 0.27%. This means that heating of the sample
due to losses from the condensate becomes a very signiﬁcant problem even when
the condensate is still quite small. It is diﬃcult to hold the system in equilibrium
for large condensates because the heat load that must be balanced by evaporation
quickly grows too large. To obtain a large condensate fraction, the normal gas could,
of course, be removed, and then E/N would be µ. The heating rate would be zero.
However, the condensate would decay quickly and there would be no reservoir from
which to replenish it.

The experiments on hydrogen may be compared to other BEC experiments using
Na, Rb, and Li. Relevant values for the quantities in equation 2.21 are tabulated in
table 2.2. These values help us understand why high equilibrium condensate fractions
can be created in Na and Rb systems. Note that three-body loss processes, while
insigniﬁcant in hydrogen, are the limiting factor which precludes larger condensate
densities in Na and Rb.

2.3.2.2 Evaporative Cooling Rate

In this section we compare the evaporative cooling rates of hydrogen and other species.
We use expressions derived using the MB energy distribution for the thermal gas
because analytic expressions exist and should yield rates reasonably close to those
obtained using the BE distribution and the quantum Boltzmann transport equation.
We postulate this because evaporation is driven preferentially by atoms with high
energy, which are in regions where the energy distribution is essentially classical.
Furthermore, we examine here only the scaling of the evaporation rate with the atomic
properties m, a, and the experimentally chosen temperature T ; exact rates are not
of interest. The correct particle loss rate may be smaller by a factor of order unity
from the results presented here, but the energy carried away by evaporating atoms
should be very similar for the two distributions. The escaping atoms must have energy
greater than the trap depth whether the gas is classical or quantum.

As shown in section A.2.1, the energy loss rate due to evaporation is

which is listed in table 2.2. We see that, for a similar η, the cooling rate for H is much
smaller than that for Na and Rb. To increase the cooling rate in H, the parameter η
must be reduced, which reduces the cooling eﬃciency.

We conclude that the equilibrium condensate fraction expected in H is much
smaller than that in Na and Rb for two reasons. First, loss from the condensate
signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the thermodynamics of the system at much lower condensate
fractions in H experiments since f= is so small. Furthermore, the cooling rate for a
given η is much less in the H experiment. It is thus easier to achieve large condensate
fractions in Rb and Na than in H. Note that the condensate fraction for Li experiments
is limited by hydrodynamic collapse of the condensate [50].

A possible remedy for the low evaporation rate in H experiments has been sug-
gested by Kleppner et al. [51]. A small admixture of impurity atoms in the trap could
act as “collision moderators” since the collision cross section with H would most likely
not be anomalously low; it should be on the order of 103 times larger than that of H-H
collisions. The increased evaporation rate should allow more atoms to be condensed,
and with a much faster experimental cycle time.

34

2.3.3 Condensate Feeding Rate

As the condensate decays by dipolar relaxation it must be fed from the thermal cloud
(which is assumed to be at the critical BEC density, nc). This feeding process may
be bottlenecked by the small collision cross section, σ, of hydrogen. To estimate
the maximum condensate replenishment rate, Rmax, we consider the event rate for
collisions between two thermal atoms assuming that the collisions occur inside the
condensate. Ignoring stimulated scattering for the moment, this rate is the collision
rate per atom times the number of thermal atoms in the region of the condensate,

The condensate volume (for samples in the Thomas-Fermi regime) is, using equation
2.13,

For small chemical potentials we approximate Vcond = 2
some fraction ζ of the collisions result in an atom being added to the condensate.
One might expect ζ to be less than unity because only a fraction of collisions involve
atoms with initial momentum and energy consistent with one atom going into the
BEC wavefunction, which has nearly zero momentum and energy. On the other
hand, the Bose enhancement factor very strongly favors population of the condensate.
Calculations by Jaksch et al.[52] (equation 19a) indicate that for a condensate near

In equilibrium the condensate population is varying slowly compared to the feeding

inﬂuenced by the scattering length, and is about 30 times larger for the Rb experiment
16 cm3/s [44]. In the experiments
listed in table 2.2, assuming a decay rate g = 10−
described in chapter 5 the largest observed value of this ratio is about 20.

A detailed understanding of the maximum condensate feeding rate is clearly de-
sirable, but is beyond the scope of this thesis. Nevertheless, it is clear that the ﬁnite
rate of replenishing the condensate from the thermal cloud can bottleneck growth of
the condensate.

2.3.4 Ultimate Condensate Population

One ﬁgure of merit for a Bose condensate is the total number of condensed atoms,
which is related to the number of atoms in the trap just prior to condensation. We
investigate here one limit to this quantity.

For a trap of eﬀective length L and eﬀective radius r which contains a density n,

the atomic population is

If evaporative cooling is used for phase space compression, one must consider that for
eﬃcient cooling to occur, energetic atoms must be able to reach a pumping surface2
before having a collision. For a cigar-shaped trap this sets a maximum radius given
by the collision length

which exhibits a strong dependence on the scattering cross section. Spin-polarized
atomic hydrogen features a cross section more than 103 times smaller than that of
the alkalis, indicating that samples with 106 times more atoms are possible. Of
course, the alkali traps can work at lower densities, but this necessitates slower forced
evaporation, and hence increases the loss due to background gas collisions. Use of a
“pancake” instead of “cigar” geometry would mean the sample size is only limited
in one dimension instead of two. However, the dimensionality of evaporation would
also be reduced from two to one dimensions, and evaporation would thus become
signiﬁcantly less eﬃcient.

Table 2.3 summarizes this fundamental limit on condensate population for thermal
3. Perhaps more important that producing huge
cloud densities of n
condensates is the sustained production rate of cold, coherent atoms for an atom
laser. This production rate should scale as Nmax times the evaporation rate, which
scales as ma2T 2
c . As shown in table 2.2, the evaporation rate for Na and Rb is about
102 higher than for H. We therefore expect the production rate of coherent atoms to

Implementing RF Evaporation

Previous attempts to realize BEC in hydrogen were thwarted by ineﬃcient evapora-
tion (see section 2.1). This chapter discusses the solution to this problem and the
hardware required to implement this solution.

In the improved apparatus an rf magnetic ﬁeld couples the Zeeman sublevel of the
trapped atoms to an untrapped level, but only in a thin shell around the trap called
the resonance region. Resonance occurs where the energy of the rf photons, ¯hωrf ,
matches the energy splitting between hyperﬁne states, proportional to the strength
of the trapping ﬁeld. Only those atoms with enough energy to reach the high potential
energy of the resonance region are ejected. The resonance region thus constitutes a
“surface of death” which surrounds the sample, and so atoms with high energy in any
direction are able to quickly escape.

The rf evaporation scheme needed to be incorporated into an existing cryogenic
experiment. The basic geometry of the trapping cell is constrained by the supercon-
ducting magnets which create the trap potential. A vertical bore of 5 cm diameter is
available for the cell along the cylindrical symmetry axis of the magnets, as shown in
ﬁgure 1-2. Into this bore ﬁts the H2 dissociator and the plastic tube which contains
the gas as it is being trapped. The length of the trapping region is about 60 cm.
The cell is thermally and mechanically anchored to the dissociator, which is anchored
to the mixing chamber of an Oxford Model 2000 dilution refrigerator. The mixing
chamber is situated above the magnets.

A complete redesign of the cryogenic trapping cell was required in order to incor-
porate the rf magnetic ﬁeld. Any good electrical conductors in the vicinity of the rf
ﬁelds and thermally connected to the cell would absorb power from the rf ﬁeld via
rf eddy currents, causing the cell to heat up. Metals, some of which had supplied
thermal conductivity, thus needed to be eliminated. A superﬂuid helium jacket was
employed to provide the heat transport formerly supplied by these metals. In addi-
tion, the coils which drive the ﬁeld were compensated so that the ﬁeld is very weak
far away from the atoms, where the large pieces of copper that comprise the disso-
ciator and mixing chamber are located. In this chapter we discuss these and other
design considerations, provide construction notes, and describe performance tests of
the apparatus.

3.1 Magnetic Hyperﬁne Resonance

In this section we determine the magnitude and frequency of the rf magnetic ﬁeld
required to drive the evaporation eﬃciently. We summarize the ground states of
hydrogen, beginning with the hyperﬁne interaction, and then adding the Zeeman
eﬀect. We obtain the four ground states and their energies. We then derive the
matrix elements for rf transitions between these states. After making a series of
simplifying approximations, we obtain the Rabi frequency for these transitions. An
analytic theory for transition probabilities in N-level systems is then adapted to our
situation. We then calculate the ﬁeld strength required to drive evaporation eﬃciently
for the trap and sample parameters of immediate interest in this experiment.

3.1.1 H in a Static Magnetic Field

The ground states of hydrogen in a magnetic ﬁeld are inﬂuenced by the hyperﬁne
interaction (interaction between electron and proton magnetic moments) and the
Zeeman interaction (the proton and electron magnetic moments interacting with the
applied magnetic ﬁeld). Here we summarize Cohen-Tannoudji et al. [53] (we use SI
units).

We start in the zero magnetic ﬁeld regime. The hyperﬁne interaction Hamiltonian

is

Hhf = AI

where ΩR = µBB1/¯h√2 is the Rabi frequency. We ignore the a-state since it is far
separated in energy from the F = 1 manifold. With these approximations we have
an eﬀective three level system with equal energy separation µBB0.

As the atoms move through the varying magnetic ﬁeld, resonant transitions occur
in a region of thickness ∆r = ¯hΩR/α which is given by the resonance’s energy width,
¯hΩR, scaled by the local potential energy gradient, α. In the vicinity of the resonance
region, the Zeeman sub-levels can be assumed to vary linearly in space. For an atom
whose speed v changes only slightly as it crosses the resonance region, the energy
levels may then be considered to vary linearly in time. The probability of changing
Zeeman sub-levels as the atom crosses the resonance region is calculated using a
variant of the Landau-Zener formalism [54] for avoided level crossings. Vitanov and
Suominen [55] have analytically calculated the dynamics for avoided level crossings
in systems with an arbitrary number of levels. They show that, for an atom initially
in the d state, the probability of emerging from the resonance region in the d, c, or b

resonance region, and emerges in the b state, antitrapped. For small ζ (the diabatic
case of interest here) there is only a small probability of leaving the trapped d state,
and the vast majority of atoms that do leave this state will emerge in the c state,
untrapped. They are pulled by gravity out of the trapping region along the trap axis.

3.1.3 RF Field Amplitude Requirement

In order to realize the improved evaporation eﬃciency we seek, the characteristic time
required to eject an energetic atom must be less than the characteristic collision time
of these atoms [56]. This condition sets a minimum rf ﬁeld amplitude.

Here we consider an atom traversing the trap radially, passing through the center.
Atoms in diﬀerent trajectories will be eﬀected diﬀerently by the rf ﬁeld and sample
density. However, in order to have a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent orbit (while still having
enough radial energy to reach the resonance region), the atom would need high energy
in both the radial and azimuthal degrees of freedom. Since this is rare (see appendix
B), we ignore these orbits and focus on the simple case of purely radial motion.

1 msec/4Pc.

1 msec. Thus τeject ∼

The characteristic time to eject an energetic atom, τeject, is the oscillation period T
divided by the probability of ejecting the atom per period, 4Pc. (We ignore coherence
between resonance crossings). The atom encounters a resonance region four times per
period since there is a resonance region on both sides of the trap, and the atom passes
through each region twice per oscillation (assuming the turning point is outside the
surface of death). The oscillation period of a particle of mass m moving in a linear
potential with gradient α and with an initial energy ǫt is T = 4√2mǫt/α. For the
500 µK, α/kB ∼
parameters of interest (ǫt/kB ∼
16 mK/cm used near the BEC
transition), we obtain a period T
∼
To ﬁnd Pc and the minimum rf ﬁeld strength, we require that the ejection time be
less than the characteristic collision time τcol = 1/n0σ¯v (A rigorous analysis includes
an average of the quantity n(ρ)v(ρ) over the atom’s trajectory, which produces a
correction factor of about 3). For atomic hydrogen near the onset of BEC at Tc ∼
50 µK, τcol ∼
100 msec. The particles thus sample the resonance region roughly
400 times before having a collision. The ejection probability Pc must be at least
3.

the approximation of a linearly varying trapping ﬁeld made above is valid. We note
that for atoms with more complicated hyperﬁne structure (F > 1) the rf ﬁeld must
be larger because an initially trapped atom must be taken through one or more
intermediate states before arriving at an untrapped state. For a given g-factor and

3.1.4 RF Coil Design

Here we describe the coil design considerations for creating an rf magnetic ﬁeld that
will drive evaporation eﬃciently in the cryogenic apparatus.

The rf magnetic ﬁeld must have a component in a direction perpendicular to the
trapping ﬁeld, as discussed above. Figure 3-2 indicates the direction of the trapping
ﬁeld in a plane that cuts through the trap. This ﬁeld is for a typical trap used for
rf evaporation experiments. Along the sides of the trap the rf ﬁeld must point in
the ˆz direction. This ﬁeld is generated by coils wrapped around the the cylindrical
conﬁnement cell. These coils are termed the “axial coils”.

It is important that the rf ﬁeld be weak enough at the top of the cell to avoid

44

inner G-10 tube (3.8 cm OD). The coil is fed by the two wires extending out the top
of the section. The loops are wound as close together as possible, and the feed wires
are laid tightly next to each other. The point z = 0 is very near the laser beam focus,
and also the minimum of the trapping potential.

heating the large copper pieces which make up the cell top, discharge and mixing
chamber (heating rates are outlined in section 3.2.1). The ﬁeld generated by a loop
of diameter a decays as (a/z)3 at large distances from the loop along the loop axis.
However, the ﬁeld can be made to decay as (a/z)5 if the loop is compensated ap-
propriately. In the far-ﬁeld the arrangement appears as a quadrupole instead of a
dipole. The heating rate is proportional to the squared magnitude of the ﬁeld, so the
heating rate falls as (a/z)10 for a compensated loop. The geometry of the axial coils
was chosen to provide large ﬁelds over the length of the cold samples and to produce
ﬁelds which decay rapidly outside the trapping region. The coils are wrapped around
the outside of the inner tube of the cell (3.8 cm diameter). They consist of three loops
in the “forward” direction at z =
3 cm, and two
loops “backward” at z =

1.2 cm. The winding pattern is shown in ﬁgure 3-3.

Figure 3-4 shows a calculation2 of the magnitude of the rf ﬁeld generated by the
axial coils along the trap axis. Figure 3-5 shows how the ﬁeld decays along the trap
axis. The nearest big pieces of metal that must be kept cold are at z = 40 cm.
Because the rf ﬁeld is compensated well, the dominant heating of the top of the cell,
dissociator, and mixing chamber arises from other mechanisms, described in section

±

scale of interest we disregard propagation eﬀects and calculate the dc ﬁeld.

dashed line is the rf ﬁeld magnitude, and the solid line is the trapping ﬁeld for the
trap used to achieve BEC.

3.4.4.

The rf ﬁelds are primarily used to remove the most energetic atoms, but it is
also sometimes desirable to remove the atoms at the very bottom of the trap where
the trapping ﬁeld is aligned along the z axis. Another set of rf coils, called the
“transverse coils”, generate a ﬁeld predominantly perpendicular to ˆz. The winding
pattern is shown in ﬁgure 3-6.

3.2 Mechanical Design of the Cell

The designs of the cells used previously in the experiment are described by Doyle [17]
and Sandberg [16]. The principle diﬀerence between those cells and the cell used for
this experiment is the presence of the rf magnetic ﬁelds. Previous designs relied on
metals to provide thermal conductance along the length of the cell, but metals must
be excluded in the new design. They would allow rf eddy currents to ﬂow, which
would heat the cell and which would screen the atoms from the applied rf ﬁelds. In
section 3.2.1 we examine the problem of rf heating. In section 3.2.2 we explain the
design of a jacket of superﬂuid 4He which surrounds the cell and provides the required
thermal conductance.

46

Figure 3-5: Proﬁle of the rf magnetic ﬁeld along the axis of the trap showing the
ﬁeld strength at z = 40 cm where the nearest pieces of cold metal are located.

3.2.1 Exclusion of Good Electrical Conductors

RF eddy currents in electrical conductors will lead to heating of the cell. This heating
during rf evaporation must be limited. The cell must be kept at a temperature below
150 mK to ensure that walls are sticky for H atoms and to ensure that the vapor
∼
pressure of the superﬂuid 4He ﬁlm, which is crucial for loading the trap, does not rise
high enough to create a signiﬁcant background gas density. A failure in either regard
would allow high energy particles (T
100 mK) to knock cold atoms out of the trap.
A technical limitation also exists: it is desirable to analyze the trapped sample very
soon after rf evaporation, and this analysis requires the cell to be below 90 mK. If
the cell is heated too much during the rf evaporation process it will take too long to
cool below this temperature.

∼

The typical thermal conductivity along the length of the cell is

1 µW/mK so
that heat loads of only 50 µW are tolerable for a mixing chamber temperature of
100 mK. We therefore must beware of power deposited via rf eddy currents in any
metals thermally connected to either the refrigerator or the cell. In previous designs,
good thermal conductivity along the length of the cell (a tube about 4 cm in diameter
and 60 cm long) was supplied by about 100 Cu wires [17]. These wires, and many
other materials, needed to be replaced in the new design in order to eliminate rf eddy
current heating.

∼

To justify the eﬀort required to remove good electrical conductors from the cell, we

the cell, and the straight sections run parallel to the symmetry axis of the cell. The

here estimate the heat per unit length deposited in a wire by eddy currents. Consider
a cylindrical conductor of radius a, length L, and electrical conductivity σ immersed
in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, aligned along the axis of the wire, that is oscillating at
angular frequency ω, as shown in ﬁgure 3-7. For a good conductor the skin depth is
roughly δ =
2/σµω [58] where µ is the permeability; for the non-magnetic materials
of interest here, we take µ = µ0 = 4π

7 H/m, the permeability of free space.

≫

For frequencies larger than ωs = 2/σµa2 the skin depth is smaller than the wire
radius. For ω
ωs we may assume that all the eddy current ﬂows in a shell of
thickness δ, and that the magnetic ﬁeld is extinguished in the wire everywhere except
in this shell. We thus simplify the problem to a shell carrying current in the azimuthal
direction through a cross-sectional area δL and around a length 2πa. The conductance
around the shell is then S = σδL/2πa. The shell is pierced by the magnetic ﬁeld in
an area A = 2πaδ. The power deposited (per unit length of wire) is P/L = SV 2/L

heating rate is so close to the limit, an alternative mechanism for heat transport was
necessary. A further problem with the Cu wires is that they shield the interior of the
cell from the rf ﬁeld.

3.2.2 Design of the Superﬂuid Jacket

In order to obtain good thermal conductance along the length of the cell we exploited
the extraordinary heat transport properties of superﬂuid helium. The new cell design
involves two concentric G-10 tubes [60] with a layer of helium between them, about
2.2 mm thick. Figure 3-8 is a cross-section through the top of the cell. There are
several issues that were addressed in the design of the cell. These are discussed in
this section.

3.2.2.1 Thermal Conductivity

The superﬂuid jacket must be thick enough to carry heat suﬃciently well from the
bottom to the top of the cell where it is transferred to the refrigerator. To calculate
the quantity of helium necessary, we must estimate the required thermal conductance
and understand heat ﬂow in the superﬂuid.

There are three temperature regimes which demand good conductance. During
loading of the trap, when T = 250 mK, the conductivity must be at least S =
0.1 mW/20 mK so that S/T 3 = 0.3 W/K4. During laser spectroscopy, when T =
140 mK, the conductivity must be at least S = 0.2 mW/20 mK so that S/T 3 =

49

Figure 3-8: Cross-section through dissociator and upper end of cell. The origin of
the scale on the right hand side is at the center of the trap. The cell and dissociator
are inside a brass vacuum can which keeps 4 K liquid helium out. The dissociator
couples to the cell via a copper mating collar and an indium o-ring. A thin copper ﬁn,
covered with silver sinter, makes thermal contact with the superﬂuid helium shell that
is conﬁned by two concentric G-10 tubes. The window at the top of the dissociator
provides optical access to the trapped atoms for laser diagnostics. Not shown are
electrical feedthrough tubes which are soldered into the copper mating collar and lie
in grooves on the outside of the dissociator,

4 W/K4. Finally, during bolometric detection, when T = 80 mK, the conductivity
must be at least S = 10 µW/10 mK so that S/T 3 = 2 W/K4.

In metals heat is carried by electrons, which typically scatter oﬀ impurities on a
length scale which is short compared to the dimensions of the object. In contrast to
this eﬀectively diﬀusive heat ﬂow behavior, heat transport in superﬂuid is essentially
ballistic because there is no impurity scattering. Furthermore, the heat is carried
by phonons which have a diﬀerent excitation spectrum than electrons. The notable
implications are that the eﬀective conductance scales with temperature as T 3 in He
but only as T 1 in metals, and that the conductivity of a column of superﬂuid depends
on the diameter of the column; phonons scatter when they hit the walls. The empirical
conductivity relation for a tube of superﬂuid is [59] κ = (20 W/K4 cm2) d T 3 where d
is the diameter of the vessel and T is the temperature. In our design the outer radius
of the inner tube is a = 1.92 cm and the inner radius of the outer tube is b = 2.14 cm.

where L = 66 cm is the length of the cell. For our geometry S/T 3 = 0.2 W/K4. The
thickness of the shell causes scattering on a length scale d in the radial dimension, but
the scattering length is signiﬁcantly longer in the azimuthal direction. We thus expect
the conductivity to be larger by a factor of two or three. Furthermore, the empirical
formula for κ above applies to surfaces from which the phonons scatter diﬀusely. If
specular reﬂection occurs, then the eﬀective scattering length is much longer [61].
The characteristic phonon wavelength at 100 mK is 300 nm [62]; since the surfaces of
the coated G-10 tubes exhibit specular reﬂection of optical wavelengths (λ
500 nm,
observed by shining a lamp on the surface), the superﬂuid phonons should also reﬂect
specularly. As will be explained in section 3.4.2 below, we have observed the superﬂuid
conductivity to be 5 times higher in tubes which exhibit specular optical reﬂection, as
compared to tubes for which the optical reﬂection is diﬀuse. Putting all these factors
together, we expect a conductance S/T 3 = 3 W/K4. There is not much margin for
error in the design. Measurements of the thermal conductivity are detailed in section
3.4.

3.2.2.2 Thermal Link from Superﬂuid to Refrigerator

Once heat has been transferred along the length of the cell, it must be transferred from
the liquid into metal links which lead to the refrigerator. This process is frustrated
by the large boundary resistance between the bulk superﬂuid and the metal. This
resistance, called the Kapitza resistance [59], arises in two ways from the factor of 25
mismatch in the speed of sound in the two materials. First, for a phonon to propagate
into the metal it must approach the surface at very nearly normal incidence; phonons
with wavevectors outside a small cone of acceptance angles experience total internal
reﬂection. Furthermore, the very diﬀerent speeds of sound give rise to a signiﬁcant
impedance mismatch, and so most of the phonons within the acceptance cone will be
reﬂected. The empirical Kapitza resistance equation is RK = (0.02 m2 K4/W)/AT 3
[59] for a superﬂuid-Cu boundary of area A and temperature T near 100 mK. For
a modest maximum resistance RK = 10 mK/100 µW at 140 mK a boundary area
of at least A = 700 cm2 is required. This is far too large to ﬁt conveniently in the
apparatus.

One way to create an eﬀective surface area that is much greater than the simple
geometric surface area is to apply sintered silver to the surface [59]. The network
of voids between the grains of the powdered metal creates a huge surface area. It is
possible to create an eﬀective surface area of 103 cm2 for a coating of silver sinter on an
area of copper that is straightforward to incorporate into the apparatus, A = 25 cm2.

51

3.2.2.3 Heat Capacity

After loading the trap at T = 250 mK it is important to cool the cell quickly to below
150 mK to achieve thermal isolation between the trapped sample and the cell walls,
as explained in section 1.3. Thus, it is important to ensure that the heat capacity of
the superﬂuid is low.

The total heat that must be extracted from the superﬂuid is the integral of the heat
capacity between the initial and ﬁnal temperatures. The heat capacity is C = C0T 3
2 J/mol K4 [59]. The quantity of heat to remove from N moles of
with C0 = 8
liquid cooled from T2 to T1 is U = C0N(T 4
T 4
1 )/4. From the 6 moles of superﬂuid
in the jacket we must thus remove 0.4 mJ. The refrigerator cooling power is about
1 mJ/s, and so the time constant is less than a second. This is acceptable.

3.2.2.4 Filling and Emptying the Jacket

×

10−

Since superﬂuid is such a good heat conductor, we must be concerned about heat
links from the coldest part of the refrigerator to warmer regions through the ﬁll
line which leads to the jacket. Heat may ﬂow through two mechanisms. When
a tube is ﬁlled with superﬂuid the thermal conductivity is given by the empirical
relation quoted above (p50). In this case the total heat conductance is proportional
to d3/L. Smaller diameter tubes are obviously much better. To limit the heat ﬂow
to less than 10 µW between the 1 K and 0.1 K stages of the refrigerator requires
d3/L < 6
7 cm2; for L = 50 cm we obtain d < 0.3 mm. The other heat
conduction mechanism occurs in tubes with only a superﬂuid ﬁlm; the ﬁlm ﬂows to
a warm region, evaporates, and sends gas back to colder regions. As it recondenses it
deposits heat. The upper limit on this process is given by the superﬂuid ﬁlm ﬂow rate.
30 nm ﬂowing at the critical velocity vc = 45 cm/s
A saturated ﬁlm of thickness t
up a tube with limiting perimeter πd will evaporate, and then recondense depositing
power Pf lux = Lvctπd = (0.9 mW/cm)d where L = 2 J/cm3 is the latent heat. To
deposit less than 10 µW at the cold end of the tube we require d < 0.1 mm. This
is an overestimate of the power transport because the warm vapor does not make it
all the way to the cold end of the tube before condensing. To minimize heat ﬂow
through the ﬁll line we chose a segmented design; 40 cm sections of 0.2 mm ID tubing
connect heat exchangers which are thermally anchored to progressively colder parts
of the refrigerator. In this way heat is deposited as far as possible from the coldest
part of the refrigerator.

∼

If the cell is warmed much above 4 K, the vapor pressure of the liquid helium rises
far above atmospheric pressure. The tiny ﬁll tube is a huge impedance to the gas
ﬂowing out of the jacket. Eﬀectively we have created a big bomb. A pressure relief
valve was developed to bleed oﬀ excess pressure in an emergency, thus protecting the
cell from bursting. More details are given in section 3.3.4.

In this section we discuss some of the techniques that were crucial for the construction
of the cell.

It is a signiﬁcant accomplishment to create joints between diﬀerent materials that
are leak-tight to superﬂuid ﬂow at low temperatures. The cell is a composite unit
consisting of a MgF2 window, two concentric convolute wound G-10 tubes, an OFHC
copper collar that seals the superﬂuid jacket at the upper end and mates the cell to
the dissociator, two rf feedthroughs, and many low frequency electrical leads. The
sealing techniques described here proved reliable.

The G-10 tubes [60] came from the factory with rough surfaces. To make them
leak-tight and to create the specularly reﬂecting surface crucial for high thermal
conductivity we coated them with an epoxy mixture of 100 parts by weight Epon-
828 [63] to 32 parts Jeﬀamine D-230 [64] catalyst. The tubes were hung vertically
while the epoxy cured and was then heat set at 60 C for 2 hours. The rf coils
were wrapped onto the tube before the coating process to allow the epoxy coating
to produce a smooth surface for specular reﬂection of the superﬂuid phonons. The
tubes were joined at the bottom to a G-10 mating ring with Stycast 2850FT epoxy,
cured with 24LV catalyst [65]. See ﬁgure 3-9. The MgF2 window was also glued in
place with Stycast 2850FT epoxy. In order to prevent the glue from contaminating
the inside surface of the window (and blocking Lyman-α transmission) the following
gluing procedure was used: the window was placed on a pedestal, and the outer

53

edge of the window was coated with glue. The cell was then held above the window
and slid gently downward. If necessary, addition glue was dabbed to create a ﬁllet
around the bottom of the window against the G-10 tube. The cell was held vertically
while the glue cured. Because 122 nm light must pass through this window, the
transmission of a window glued this way was tested in the ultraviolet, using easily
accessible 243 nm radiation. No degradation was observed. Windows glued in this
way have been thermally cycled to 1.4 K many times without ever leaking. Thermal
shock is a problem, though, so the windows were never brought in direct contact with
liquid nitrogen during the leak checks.

Dual thermometers and a heater are placed at each end of the cell. Other wires
lead into the superﬂuid jacket space and connect to pads or meshes used to produce
the electric ﬁeld required for rapid quenching of the metastable atomic 2S state. All
of these leads are brought into the jacket space through a simple epoxy feedthrough;
the wires pass through a 1.67 mm ID tube which is ﬁlled with 2850 epoxy for several
centimeters. Each rf coil is driven by a twisted pair of superconducting leads (Cu clad
NbTi wire with a single 33 µm diameter core) The twisted pair for the axial coils is
connected to a semirigid coax line (2.16 mm OD Cu [66]) which passes through the
Cu mating block at the top of the cell. The other end of the line is soft-soldered to
a brass cylinder containing a hermetic SMA connector [67] soldered in place. This
sealing technique works reliably. The twisted pair which feeds the transverse rf coil
passes through an epoxy feedthrough and is connected to an SMA connector in the
vacuum space that surrounds the cell.

The semirigid coax cables which deliver the rf power to the cell are composite units
that optimize the compromise between low thermal conductivity and high electrical
conductivity. Cables with high electrical and thermal resistivity (Lakeshore model
CC-SR-10 [68]) carry the rf power to the 1.6 K pumped 4He pot, where the cables are
thermally anchored. The ohmic heating of these lines is too much of a heat load for
the mixing chamber, however, so lower resistivity lines (Lakeshore type C) carry the
rf power to the cell (which is thermally connected to the mixing chamber). To reduce
the thermal conductivity of these lines, a 1 cm section of the high resistivity cable
is spliced in. The thermal conductance is dramatically reduced, but the electrical
conductance is high enough to eliminate excessive heating.

3.3.2 Sintering

Eﬀective heat transfer from superﬂuid to copper is diﬃcult to achieve, as explained
above. A layer of sintered silver was fused onto each side of the Cu ﬁn, shown
in ﬁgure 3-8, to increase the surface area for heat transfer and reduce the overall
thermal resistance. The ﬁn is high purity copper [69], 0.5 mm thick, and is brazed
[70] to the Cu mating collar. The sintering process consists of several steps [71, 72].
First, the surface of the ﬁn is cleaned by immersion in 1 molar nitric acid for 30 s,
then rinsed with deionized water. The surface is then plated with silver to increase
the bonding of the sinter to the Cu ﬁn. The surface is immersed in a plating solution
(electroless silver cyanide [73]) for 15 minutes at 95 C. The surface is then rinsed
again with deionized water, and the assembly is baked at 120 C for 35 minutes in an

54

air atmosphere. The baking was suggested to “diﬀusion weld” the plating to the Cu
substrate. The Ag sintering powder (nominally 700 ˚A particle size) [74] is ﬁrst cleaned
by baking at 50 C for 30 min in an H2 atmosphere. The powder is then compressed
onto the Cu ﬁn in a specially designed curved press which matches the curved surface
of the Cu ﬁn. The ﬁn was sintered sequentially in eight radial segments at a pressure
105 Pa. The press apparatus and mating collar were heated to about 100 C
of 5
during the operation. About 7 g of powder were bonded to the ﬁn, producing an
estimated 10 m2 surface area.

3.3.3 Bolometer

The bolometer is used as a diagnostic of the trapped gas [17]. As atoms are released
from the trap, their ﬂux is measured by detecting the molecular recombination heat,
4.6 eV per event. A resistive element serves as both a thermometer and a heater;
the electrical power required to maintain the bolometer at a constant temperature is
recorded. The bolometer used in these experiments is similar to previous designs. It

by nylon threads from a G-10 cradle which is glued into the cell. Electrical contact
is made through superconducting ﬁlaments extracted from multiﬁlament supercon-
ducting wire by dissolution of its Cu matrix in nitric acid. The wires are contacted
to evaporated Au pads on the quartz by conducting epoxy [75] overlaid with Stycast
1266 epoxy. The Au pads touch graphite resistive elements which were formed by
dabbing Aerodag [76] onto the surface. The diﬀerences in the present bolometer de-
sign from previous designs arise from eﬀorts to reduce rf eddy current heating. Large
gold contact pads have been replaced by pads of a few mm2 surface area. A redundant
design was used consisting of four contact pads in a row with three resistive elements
between them. The pads are spaced very closely so that the resistive elements could
have resistances of a few kΩ without large mass. This bolometer has been reliable.

3.3.4 Pressure Relief Valve

The vapor pressure of the six moles of liquid helium in the superﬂuid jacket of the cell
can cause the cell to explode if the temperature is raised too high before the liquid is
removed. This conjecture has been tested. Recall that the ﬁll line for the jacket has
a very low gas conductance, and so it takes many hours to remove the liquid. In the
case of an accidental overheating, it is desirable that the liquid in the jacket have an
escape path with a high conductance.

We constructed a reusable pressure relief valve which provides this high conduc-
tance escape path. The reusable valve is at the same temperature as the superﬂuid
jacket so that large diameter tubing can connect the two; there are no heat leak
concerns which dictate small tubing. The design of the relief valve is conceptually
divided into a pressure-sensing part and a seal-breaking part. The pressure sensor
is a BeCu bellows tube [77] which lengthens as the pressure inside increases. The
seal to be broken is a 25 µm thick piece of brass shim stock which is soft-soldered
to a brass ﬂange, and is replaceable. When the seal is broken the gas escapes into

brazed into the base makes a superﬂuid tight vacuum connection to the superﬂuid
jacket through 2 mm ID tubes. The BeCu bellows tube ﬁts around a Cu guide
cylinder that prevents buckling and keeps the hole in the brass ﬂange aligned with
the hypodermic needle. A thin brass sheet is soft-soldered to the brass ﬂange to
provide a vacuum seal that is easy for the needle to puncture.

the large vacuum space which surrounds the cell. The ﬂange is brazed to the bellows
and moves toward a stainless steel hypodermic needle as the pressure increases (The
bellows are pre-stretched during installation. They do not start to move until there
is a pressure diﬀerential of about 0.5 bar). A touch sensor makes electrical contact
with the brass shim stock before it meets the needle, alerting the operator that seal
rupture is imminent. The relief valve is shown in ﬁgure 3-10. The relief valve has
been tested. It is simple and reliable.

3.4 Measurements of Cell Properties

Measurements have been made of several key parameters, such as thermal conduc-
tivity, heat capacity, rf ﬁeld strength, and rf heating rates. In this section we outline
these results.

3.4.1 Measurements of RF Field Strength

The strength of the rf ﬁeld generated by the axial and transverse coils was measured
by inserting a pick-up coil inside the inner G-10 tube during construction of the cell.
The absolute ﬁeld strength and ﬁeld proﬁle along the cell axis were found to agree well
with calculations for frequencies up to about 5 MHz, where the inductive impedance
matched the 50 Ω driving impedance and the response began to drop. When the cell

56

is cooled to 100 mK the response could be diﬀerent because of the lower resistance of
the superconducting wire which forms the coils.

The axial ﬁeld was measured with a 1.6 cm diameter pickup loop positioned in
the center of the cell (the test was done before attaching the bottom window onto the
cell). To match the impedance of the loop to that of coax signal cable, an op amp
[79] was connected directly to the loop. The output of the unity gain ampliﬁer drove
the signal cable through a 50 Ω resistor. The frequency response of the ampliﬁer
was measured, and so the pickup loop probe has a calibrated response to 200 MHz.
Knowledge of the geometry of the loop and of the gains in the system allow us to
measure the ﬁeld with an accuracy of about 20%. An HP4195A network analyzer
was used both to calibrate the probe and to measure the ﬁelds. The coils were driven
through the high thermal impedance microminiature coax cable [68] used to convey
rf power from room temperature through the refrigerator to the cell. The response of
the coils is shown in ﬁgure 3-11. The structure above 50 MHz is most likely due to
resonances in the feed line and coil structure.

The cell resides inside a brass vacuum can in the experiment, and this conductor,
near the coils, can inﬂuence the ﬁeld; a counter current is generated which tends to
partially cancel the ﬁeld. This eﬀect has been modeled, and the reductions shown in
ﬁgure 3-11 are consistent.

Note that as the apparatus is cooled to operating temperature the resistance of the
axial (transverse) coil changes from 13 Ω (26 Ω) to zero. We thus expect a 30% (50%)
increase in ﬁeld at low frequencies, and the corner frequency should move higher by
30% (50%).

3.4.2 Thermal Conductivity

The thermal conductivity along the length of the cell has been measured in the
temperature range 50 mK to 450 mK. As described above, the superﬂuid jacket is
a shell between two concentric cylinders. The outer tube has an inside diameter of
4.27 cm, and the inner tube has an outside diameter of 3.83 cm. The thickness of
the shell is thus 2.2 mm. The vertical distance between the thermometers used for
the following measurements is about 59 cm. The jacket space is cluttered by 5 mil
diameter manganin wires which connect to thermometers, heaters, the bolometer,
and plates used to apply electric ﬁelds. The thermal conductivity is reduced since
phonons scatter oﬀ these structures.

Thermal conductivity measurements were made by controlling the temperature
at the top of the cell, applying heat at the bottom of the cell, and measuring the
temperatures. The two resistance thermometers at the bottom of the cell allowed
consistency checks against each other; one of the thermometers at the top of the
cell veriﬁed the operation of the temperature controller, which used the other cell top
thermometer. The thermometers consist of a RuO paste on a ceramic substrate, man-
ufactured for surface mounting on printed circuit boards [80]. The four thermometers
used in the cell were calibrated in a previous cooldown against another RuO resis-
tance thermometer, which was itself calibrated by Oxford Instruments. The heaters
at the top and bottom of the cell were each made of two 5 kΩ metal ﬁlm resistors.

line is the ﬁeld when the cell is surrounded by the brass vacuum can. The dashed line
corresponds to no conductors in the vicinity of the cell. The coil is driven through
the coax lines in the cryostat.

The two resistors for each heater were positioned on opposite sides of the jacket,
but at the same vertical (ˆz) position. The heaters were at about the same vertical
position as the thermometers. The temperature of the top of the cell was controlled
by a proportional-integral controller (1 s proportional time constant, 3 s integrator
time constant). The thermal conductance at a given temperature was extracted from
a series of measurements such as those in ﬁgure 3-12. Conductances were measured
at several cell temperatures. They are compiled in ﬁgure 3-13. All temperature rises
were less than 10%. The conductances measured here are adequate for the experi-
ments we wish to perform.

thermometer as the sensor). The lines are linear ﬁts for the range of powers from
0 to 2.5 µW. The slopes of the two upper lines give the thermal resistance of the
cell at this temperature. The resistances measured by the two thermometers are

the superﬂuid to metal and eventually to the refrigerator, may be measured in an
analogous way. The temperature of the dissociator was controlled with a thermometer
and heater near the top of the dissociator (see ﬁgure 3-8). The thermal gradient
measured thus includes the thermal resistance across the indium o-ring vacuum seal
(superconductivity quenched by 4 T ﬁeld) and along the length of the dissociator.
The data from the two thermometers at the top of the cell were ﬁt to straight lines,
similarly to the data in ﬁgure 3-12. Two temperatures and conductivities were thus
obtained for each temperature control point. These two data sets are shown in ﬁgure
3-14.

The conductance of the cell is similar to the conductance across the sinter. Any
signiﬁcant improvements to the thermal conductivity of the system would need to
address both of these segments of the heat transport channel.

In a separate experiment the eﬀects of specular and diﬀuse phonon scattering
were studied. A cell similar to that described above was made. The surfaces of the

to create an optically dull ﬁnish. The remaining 42 cm exhibited the shiny surface
characteristic of the epoxy coating. The thermal conductance of the two sections was
measured in the range 50 mK to 300 mK. The section with diﬀuse optical reﬂection
had a conductance three times lower than the other section. We thus conclude that
diﬀuse reﬂection reduces the conductivity by a factor of 3

3.4.3 Heat Capacity

The heat capacity of the cell and dissociator have been measured together in a typ-
ical trap loading sequence. The dissociator was held by a temperature controller at
280 mK for 7 sec while pulsing an rf discharge inside. The heater and discharge where
then turned oﬀ, and the cell plus dissociator assembly was cooled. The temperature
of the bottom of the cell is shown in ﬁgure 3-15. The cooling rate is expected to be
dominated by the large heat capacities of the large copper pieces which comprise the
dissociator and mixing chamber. Note that the molar speciﬁc heats of copper and

3.4.4 RF Heating

When rf power is introduced into the cryostat the cell and mixing chamber are
warmed. Ohmic heating occurs in the coax lines that deliver the power to the cell,
and rf eddy currents cause heating of the metals in the vicinity of the coils. Mea-
surements of these heating rates is complicated by imprecise knowledge of where the
power is deposited and by disruption of the thermometer readout circuits by the rf
ﬁelds. Nevertheless, some information can be obtained.

The most reliable piece of information relates to the ejection of atoms from the

trapped sample, knocking atoms out of the trap.
In many cases the maximum rf
power is set by this criterion. A test was done of this ejection process by simply
ramping the rf frequency across the range of interest (23 MHz to 2 MHz) at various
rf powers, and noting how many atoms were ejected. To prevent resonant ejection a
large bias ﬁeld was applied so that the minimum resonance frequency of the trapped

superﬂuid.

atoms was always above the applied rf frequency. No ejection was noted for powers
up to +27 dBm outside the cryostat (corresponding to about 30 mG ﬁelds). The
cell thermometers indicated 220 mK (bottom) and 180 mK (top). The maximum rf
powers used for the experiments in this thesis were +15 dBm, so ejection of atoms
from the trap was not a problem.

Another piece of reliable data is that the cell will stay below 160 mK when rf ﬁelds
of roughly 5 mG are applied at frequencies of 23 MHz and below. This temperature
is low enough to allow the cell to cool reasonably quickly to temperatures at which
atoms may be dumped out of the trap and analyzed.

We note that there are a few resonances at which signiﬁcant heating occurs. These
are above 25 MHz. One possible rf leak might occur where the superconducting
twisted pair is joined to the coax. Further investigations of where heating occurs
should be pursued. Methods could include a consideration of how fast objects cool
when the rf is turned oﬀ and the time required for heat to reach various thermometers.

Manipulating Cold Hydrogen by
RF Resonance

Resonant RF ejection of atoms from the trap is a tool for manipulating and studying
the hydrogen gas. This tool has not previously been applied to trapped hydrogen, and
so the peculiarities of this system have not been explored. We ﬁnd—as anticipated—
that rf ejection can eﬃciently remove energetic atoms that would otherwise not ﬁnd
their way out of the trap over the magnetic saddlepoint barrier. Experiments are
described in section 4.1. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that rf ejection spectroscopy can
constitute a valuable diagnostic technique near BEC, where the trap dump technique
used previously fails. RF ejection spectroscopy is also an essential tool for measuring
the magnetic ﬁeld at the bottom of the trapping potential. These topics are covered
in section 4.2.

4.1 RF Evaporation

4.1.1 Need for RF Evaporation: Orbits with Long Escape

Times

In section 2.1 we explained that, for low temperature samples in tightly compressed
traps, the saddlepoint evaporation technique leads to one dimensional evaporation.
Recall that atoms with high radial energy are unable to escape before having a colli-
sion. In this section we demonstrate this problem experimentally.

Three successive samples are identically prepared by cooling into a trap with
depth ǫt/kB = 1.1 mK, set by a magnetic saddlepoint. The trap radial gradient is
α/kB = 4.4 mK/cm. After the evaporation cycle is completed, the sample is held
for many seconds (
20), on the order of three characteristic collision times. The
saddlepoint barrier is then reduced to zero in 5 s while the atom ﬂux is recorded
as a function of barrier height by sensing the heat of molecular recombination on
a sensitive bolometer (section 4.2.3). In its simplest interpretation, this ﬂux proﬁle
is the energy distribution of the trapped cloud. (Corrections to this picture will be
described in section 4.2.1). Figure 4-1 shows atom ﬂux proﬁles for the three samples.

Figure 4-1: Comparison of dump signals from samples with and without rf ejection.
The solid sloping line shows the trap depth as it is reduced from 1.1 mK to zero.
The curves indicate the atom ﬂux as the trap depth is reduced. The dashed curves
correspond to a samples that were exposed to rf tuned to the trap depth for 9 s and
23 s. The solid curve corresponds to a sample with no rf exposure. The rf ﬁelds eject
a sizeable fraction of the sample and change the shape of the proﬁle. The response
time of the detection process is seen at the end of the ramp, at t=5 s.

The largest proﬁle is for a sample (sample 1) that was held for 10 s, and then dumped
from the trap. For the smaller two proﬁles, a weak rf ﬁeld resonant at the trap depth
θ) was applied for 9 s (sample 2) and 23 s (sample 3) at the point in
(ǫt = hνrf −
the sequence where sample 1 was held. The samples were then dumped out of the
trap in the same way as sample 1. We see that a signiﬁcant fraction of the atoms
have been ejected from samples 2 and 3. To be ejected, these atoms must have had a
total energy that was above the magnetic saddlepoint energy. Since these atoms did
not leave the trap in sample 1, they were apparently in orbits with escape times of at
least ten seconds. This experiment demonstrates the long times required for energetic
atoms to escape when the energy barrier is set only by a magnetic ﬁeld saddlepoint
at one end of the trap, and the reduction in escape time when the atoms can leave
in any direction. Furthermore, the decrease in trap population between samples 2
and 3 indicates the long thermalization time of the system as it equilibrates to the
lower eﬀective trap depth for the radial degrees of freedom. This trap had a radial
conﬁnement that was a factor of
3 weaker than those used for attaining BEC as
described in section 5.2, and so these experiments place a lower bound on the problem.

Figure 4-2: Demonstration of slow transfer of energy from axial to transverse mo-
tional degrees of freedom. The ﬁve curves are the ﬂux of atoms escaping the trap as
the magnetic energy barrier at one end of the trap is slowly ramped to zero (linearly
sloping line), for each of ﬁve samples. The samples labeled 1-4 correspond to vari-
ous durations of exposure of the sample to 10 MHz rf ﬁelds with strengths of a few
milligauss. Sample 5 was conﬁned in a short trap, and was exposed to an rf ﬁeld at
10 MHz for 20 s. The ﬁeld had ten times more power than for samples 1-4.

4.1.2 Mixing of Energy

It is postulated that there is only very weak coupling among the motional degrees
of freedom of a particle moving in the trap potential. This weak coupling between
transverse and axial degrees of freedom is the impetus for driving evaporation with rf
ﬁelds. In this section we describe a simple experiment which demonstrates this very
weak coupling.

Four identically prepared samples are each cooled into a trap with depth ǫt =
1.1 mK and radial gradient α = 4.5 mK/cm. The trap is signiﬁcantly longer than
the one shown in ﬁgure 3-4, with the sample extending from roughly z =
6 cm
to z = +9 cm. The sample is adiabatically expanded by opening the trap slowly,
reducing the radial gradient to α = 1.3 mK/cm, but leaving the length constant. The

×

Figure 4-2 shows the ﬂux of atoms escaping the trap as the magnetic conﬁnement
ﬁeld at one end of the trap is linearly ramped to zero. As explained above, this
atom ﬂux can be interpreted as an indication of the distribution of energies of the

65

trapped atoms. The four traces labeled 1-4 correspond to the four samples. The ﬁrst
sample was simply held in the trap for 20 s after preparation, and then dumped. The
second, third, and fourth samples had an rf ﬁeld (a few milligauss strength) applied
for various times—35 s, 100 s, and 200 s. The frequency (10 MHz) corresponds to
slightly less than half the trap depth set by the magnetic ﬁeld barrier at the end of
the trap. Even though the rf ﬁeld is produced by both the axial and transverse coils,
the rf ﬁelds have signiﬁcant strength (and appropriate polarity) only along the sides
of the trap, and not at the ends. We expect the rf ﬁelds to only eject atoms with
energy in the transverse (not axial) directions.

Comparing sample 1 to sample 2, we see that about two-thirds of the atoms are
ejected when the rf is applied for 35 s, and that the energy distribution is narrowed,
a sign of cooling. As the rf exposure is continued (samples 3 and 4), a few more
atoms are ejected, and the sample continues to slowly cool. Two time scales thus
appear. The fast time scale (
10 s) must correspond to removal of atoms with high
energy in the transverse degrees of freedom. These atoms interact directly with the
rf ﬁelds. The slow time scale (
100 s) is for removal of atoms that originally had
high energy in the axial degree of freedom, but low energy in the transverse direction.
It apparently takes on the order of 100 s for enough energy to transfer from axial
motion to transverse motion to allow the atoms to reach the resonance region.

∼

∼

This interpretation is supported by the data shown in ﬁgure 4-2 for sample 5.
This sample was prepared identically to samples 1-4, but the trap was short. There
was signiﬁcant ﬁeld strength (and appropriate polarity) at the ends as well as the
sides of the trap, so that atoms with high energy in either the axial or the transverse
direction could pass through the resonance region (again, both transverse and axial
coils are used, as is done for the routine rf evaporation in chapter 5). The resonance
region wraps completely around the sample, in contrast to samples 1-4 for which
the resonance region is essentially a tube around half the length of the sample. We
observe that the energy distribution is narrowed very signiﬁcantly with only short
application of the rf ﬁeld. This happens because energy does not need to mix among
degrees of freedom before ejection can occur.

4.1.3 RF Field Strength Required for Evaporation

As discussed in section 3.1.3, the rf ﬁeld strength used during evaporation must be
strong enough to eject energetic atoms from the trap before they have a collision. We
have experimentally determined this power requirement for a typical sample density
and trap shape. A series of samples are identically prepared at T
70 µK, and then
evaporatively cooled to a given trap depth using rf ﬁelds of varying power. After this
rf cooling cycle the atoms are dumped from the trap, and the total number of trapped
atoms is recorded. For very low rf powers essentially no rf evaporation occurs, and
the sample is not depleted. For higher powers the sample is signiﬁcantly depleted,
up to an rf power that saturates the process. At this high power, energetic atoms are
promptly removed before having a collision; no further sample depletion is possible
with increasing power because the atom ejection rate is no longer bottlenecked by the
rf ejection rate, but rather by the rate at which collisions in the gas create energetic

atoms.

Figure 4-3 shows one such saturation measurement. The rf frequency is swept
from 17 MHz to 9.7 MHz at various rf ﬁeld strengths. Two thirds of the atoms are
removed when the ﬁeld strength is above 2 mG. This agrees well with the calculation
in section 3.1.3. Note, however, the large scale uncertainty on the horizontal axis.
Ideally we would plot an eﬀective ﬁeld strength which is the appropriate average of
the ejection rate over the resonance surface (see section 4.2.2); ignorance of the details
of the rf ﬁeld direction and strength makes this average diﬃcult. We have therefore
plotted on the horizontal axis the strength of the ﬁeld at low frequencies, as measured
at one point in the cell at room temperature for a given power applied outside the
cryostat. A correction was made for the frequency response measured in section 4.2.5,
assuming a driving frequency of 10 MHz. The number of remaining atoms continues
to slowly drop as a function of ﬁeld strength even for ﬁelds much greater than the
saturation ﬁeld of 2 mG. This behavior is not understood.
It might indicate the
presence of atoms in high angular momentum orbits which only very rarely cross the
resonance region.

4.2 RF Ejection Spectroscopy

The simple technique of rf ejection spectroscopy is useful as a diagnostic of the tem-
perature and density of the trapped gas near BEC. It has signiﬁcant advantages over
the trap dump technique used previously, which becomes completely ambiguous near
the BEC threshold. For probing the condensate, the technique is inferior to optical
spectroscopy (described in section 5.1.1), but it is much simpler to use. In this section
we explain the problems which make the trap dump technique ambiguous. We then
develop a theory that explains the rf ejection measurements. After an explanation of
the bolometric detection process employed in the rf ejection spectroscopy, we show
how the technique can be used to measure the magnetic ﬁeld at the bottom of the
trap and to measure the temperature of a cold sample.

4.2.1 Ambiguities of the Trap Dump Technique

In previous experiments the sample was studied by dumping it from the trap and
measuring its energy distribution (see section 2.5 and 2.6 in [17]); the distribution
was inferred by measuring the ﬂux of escaping atoms as the axial trap barrier was
reduced (see ﬁgure 4-1 for example). Ambiguities arise, however, because of conﬂict-
ing timescales. In order to measure an energy distribution, the ﬂux detector must
respond in a time τdet which is short compared to the duration over which the trap
energy threshold is reduced to zero, τdump. Furthermore, the characteristic sample
equilibration time, τequil, must be long compared to τdump so that the energy distri-
bution does not change during the dump process. For the dense samples studied near
the BEC transition the equilibration time is τequil ∼
300 ms. The detector response
time is τdet ∼
200 ms. A further crippling complication is that the characteristic
escape time, τesc, for an atom with total energy greater than the trap depth must be
short compared to τdump so that all of the atoms in a given energy slice leave the trap
before atoms from the next slice begin to come out; in the tightly compressed traps
used near the BEC transition this escape time has been observed to be many tens of
seconds, as demonstrated by ﬁgure 4-1. The timescale hierarchy,

τdet, τesc ≪

τdump ≪

τequil

(4.1)

is not achievable, and the trap dump technique fails to providing reliable measure-
ments of the energy distribution of samples near the BEC regime. There is also a
practical problem. As the axial conﬁnement magnetic ﬁeld is lowered, the trap shape
changes. Often a magnetic ﬁeld zero forms, further complicating the measurements.
RF ejection spectroscopy, in which a resonance region is tuned through the trap
to eject atoms with various potential energies, addresses all these problems. The trap
shape remains unchanged, so no zeros are introduced. The particle escape time can be
short because atoms are coupled out in all directions. Finally, the energy distribution
of the sample does not change signiﬁcantly during the measurement process because
only a small fraction of the atoms are removed.

4.2.2 Theory of RF Ejection Spectroscopy of a Trapped Gas

In this section we use the results of the Landau-Zener theory discussed in section
3.1.2 to explain the rf ejection spectrum expected for a trapped gas, i.e. the ﬂux of
atoms ejected as a function of the frequency of the rf magnetic ﬁeld. This expression
is used to interpret the spectra presented later in the chapter.

Btrap(r)

Consider a sample trapped in a magnetic potential V (r) = µB |

described
by the potential energy density of states function ̺(ε). The bottom of the trap is
at a magnetic ﬁeld B0 = θ/µB. An rf magnetic ﬁeld, oscillating at frequency νrf
with strength Brf , is superimposed on the trap, and resonantly interacts with atoms
θ. For the analysis that follows
crossing a surface of constant potential εres = hνrf −
we note that this surface area and its diﬀerential thickness is related to ̺(ε) dε, which
is the diﬀerential volume in the trap with potential energy in a range dε around ε.
This volume may be written as an integral, over the area of the surface of constant
ε, of the diﬀerential “thickness” dε/

where α(r) is the gradient of the potential at position r. This result will be used to
derive equation 4.6.

We wish to ﬁnd the rate at which atoms leave the trap as a result of Zeeman sub-
level transitions in the resonance region. In a patch of resonance surface of diﬀerential
area dA at position r, the diﬀerential atom loss rate is d ˙N = F P dA, where F is the
ﬂux passing through the surface from either direction and P is the probability of the
atom emerging from the resonance surface in an untrapped Zeeman sublevel. Equa-
tions 3.23 and 3.24 indicate that, in the limit of low rf ﬁeld strength, the vast majority
of transitions are made from the d to c Zeeman sublevels. The transition probability

transition probability exhibits a velocity dependence. The ﬂux of atoms with velocity
v passing through the surface is F (v) = n(r)fv(v)v where fv(v) is a normalized one
dimensional velocity distribution function, such as derived in appendix E, and n(r)
is the density at position r (either the Bose-Einstein or Maxwell-Boltzmann density,
as appropriate). Since both P and F exhibit a velocity dependence, the diﬀerential

Here we have deﬁned Bef f as an eﬀective rf ﬁeld strength obtained by a weighted
average, over the resonance surface, of the magnitude of the component of the rf ﬁeld

If the polarization of Brf is randomized all over the resonance surface, then the cross
product in equation 4.6 is essentially a scalar product, and Bef f (ε) is the average, over
the equipotential surface, of the square of the rf ﬁeld strength. This approximation
is similar to a random phase approximation. Furthermore, if the length scale for
variations in the ﬁeld strength is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the size of the trap, then
the ﬁeld averaged over the surface will be independent of the equipotential chosen.
Certainly if the ﬁeld is uniform over the trap (characteristic length long compared
to size of trap), then the average of the ﬁeld over the equipotential surface does not

scale of the ﬂuctuations in the ﬁeld strength is short compared to the size of the trap,
then the variations average out over the surface regardless of the surface chosen. The
result in either case is that Bef f is independent of ε. The ﬁeld generated in the cell
by a given rf driving power, measured outside the cryostat, can vary as a function
of frequency; this “transfer function” is an artifact of the reactance of the coils and
the drive line impedance, and is measured in section 4.2.5. This dependence is not
included here.

In our experiment these two approximations (random orientation and incommen-
surate length scale) are not so bad; the rf ﬁeld is a superposition of the ﬁelds generated
by both the transverse and axial coils. The strength of the axial ﬁeld varies on a length
scale much shorter than the trap length, but much longer than the trap diameter,
due to the ﬁeld compensation scheme employed. Figure 3-4 shows the strength of
the axial ﬁeld along the symmetry axis of the trap. The ﬁeld of the transverse coil
is essentially uniform all across the trap. Since the relative strengths of the rf ﬁeld
components vary all over the trap, the direction of the ﬁeld also varies. Tests of this
simplifying assumption are outlined in section 4.2.5. The relative phase of the axial
and transverse ﬁeld is assumed to be zero, independent of frequency and position.
Violations of this assumption have not been considered.

If Bef f has no strong dependence on ε, then the ﬂux of atoms ejected from the

70

trap for a given νrf is proportional to the number of atoms with potential energy ε,
n(ε)̺(ε), as found in equation 4.6. A distribution of potential energies may thus be
obtained by sweeping the resonance surface through the trap. This distribution can
be used to infer the sample temperature.

A further approximation used in the interpretation of the spectra is that the
sample’s energy distribution does not change while the spectrum is being measured.
This condition could be fulﬁlled by measuring the spectrum quickly compared to the
rethermalization time, but, as explained above, the response time of the detection
process is too slow. Another way to realize this condition is to remove only a small
fraction of the atoms while obtaining the spectrum. The number of atoms ejected
from the trap in a duration τspec is Neject =
(ε(t)). For a linear ramp of the
resonance from the bottom to the top of the trap, we have ε(t) = (εt/τspec)t and

4.2.3 Bolometric Detection

Atoms coupled out of the trap by rf resonance are detected by sensing a small fraction
of the molecular recombination heat they liberate. The detection process is explained
in detail by Doyle [17]. Atoms (in the c-state) leaving the trap stick to the cell
wall. A fraction experience a spin ﬂip to the b- or a-state, opening the way for rapid
recombination.
If the residence time on the wall is long enough, and if the time
associated with sliding along the wall out of the detection region and into a high
ﬁeld region is long enough, and if the surface density is high enough, then the vast
majority of the atoms will recombine. The heat deposited on the bolometer will be
proportional to the number of atoms which escaped from the trap. The picture is
modiﬁed slightly for the rf spectroscopic studies presented here because the atoms are
ejected in the c-state instead of the doubly spin-polarized d-state treated by Doyle.
State mixing should occur rapidly, however, induced by magnetic impurities on the

and the resulting bolometer signal is recorded. For this pulse the ﬁt delay time
is τdelay = 277 ms, the fall time is τf all = 340 ms, and the eﬀective rise time is
τrise = 251 ms. The heat in this pulse is 2.6 pJ, which corresponds to the heat

walls, and so the remaining considerations are still valid. They indicate that the
cell walls should be cold (80 mK) and that the atom ﬂux should be high. Both of
these conditions impose limitations on the techniques described here. We observe
well resolved rf spectra with atom ﬂuxes on the order of 109 atoms per second falling
out of the trap toward the bolometer.

Crucial to the interpretation of the spectra presented is an understanding of the
time response of the bolometric detection process, as suggested above. The impulse
response function of the detection system was measured directly using a series of
200 ms rf pulses at various frequencies for samples of two diﬀerent temperatures in
the range of interest. Figure 4-4 shows a typical pulse and an analytic ﬁt of the form

τrise = 246 ms, and τf all = 337 ms. The dependence of these parameters on the ﬁlm
thickness has not been studied systematically, but at low ﬁlm thicknesses the H-He
binding energy increases and the atoms stick promptly; τdelay decreases. Because
the rf pulse has ﬁnite duration, the measured response is not, strictly speaking, the
impulse response function. Nevertheless, it is a good approximation, and the analytic
ﬁt parameters quoted above were used in calculating the spectra presented in the
following sections.

the bolometer with short pulses of light from a HeNe laser. The response time was

4.2.4 Measuring the Trap Bias Field

The bias ﬁeld in the Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap, θ/µB, sets the characteristic sample tem-
perature at which the trap functional form changes from predominantly linear (T
≫
θ/kB) to predominantly harmonic (T
θ/kB) in the two radial dimensions. It is thus
an important quantity for analysis of Bose condensation experiments. Furthermore,
θ, one must know both the trap energy barrier
to know the trap depth ǫt = hνrf −
(set by the experimenter) and the bias energy.

≪

The bias is directly measured by sweeping up the frequency of the rf ﬁeld until
atoms begin to be ejected from the trap. Figure 4-5 shows such a sweep. The atoms
begin to be coupled out of the trap at about t = 5 s, corresponding to a frequency
νθ = 700 kHz; in this case we ﬁnd θ/kB = νθh/kB = 33.6 µK. RF ejection is a
powerful and sensitive technique to quickly and accurately measure the absolute trap
bias.

The bias can also be inferred by deforming the trap potential until a ﬁeld zero
is created; atoms begin to experience Majorana ﬂips, leave the bottom of the trap,
and get detected by the bolometer. The zero is made by changing the current in a
solenoid that creates a fairly uniform ﬁeld along the length of the trap. Integration of
the Biot-Savart law gives the ﬁeld strength per unit current. This method of ﬁnding
the bias ﬁeld is not as accurate as the rf ejection method since the trap shape is
deformed for the measurement. Nevertheless, the two methods agree to within the
experimental uncertainties.

4.2.5 Measuring the Eﬀective RF Field Strength

In order to analyze rf ejection spectra, one must know the eﬀective rf ﬁeld strength,
Bef f given by equation 4.6. It may exhibit complicated polarization dependences if
the random orientation and incommensurate length scale approximations made in
the discussion of equation 4.6 are invalid. Furthermore, there may be a frequency
dependence in the ﬁeld strength generated in the cell by a given rf power applied
outside the cryostat, as discussed in section 3.4.1. Clearly a measurement of the
eﬃciency is in order.

73

Figure 4-5: Measurement of trap bias using rf ejection. The rf ﬁeld is switched on
at t = 0 and swept from 200 kHz to 1.2 MHz. The atoms begin to leave the trap at
about 700 kHz. The sloping baseline signal results from atoms evaporating out of the
trap as the sample continues to cool after the end of the forced evaporative cooling
cycle.

RF spectra were measured to verify the ejection eﬃciency for frequencies between
1 and 17 MHz. The ejection rate at a given frequency, given by equation 4.5, includes
the density, the potential energy density of states, and the eﬀective rf ﬁeld strength.
In order to simplify the measurement of the eﬃciency, the density was kept constant
over the energy range of interest by using a warm sample, T
1 mK> hνmax/kB.
The potential energy density of states functional form is known well. The quantity
obtained, then, is the ejection eﬃciency as a function of frequency. The ﬂux ejected
as the frequency of the rf ﬁeld was swept upward is shown in ﬁgure 4-6 for the axial
coil alone, the transverse coil alone, and both coils together. Another sweep, taken
with no atoms in the trap but with both coils driven, indicates rf pickup and heating
eﬀects.

The simplest model of the frequency dependence of the ejection eﬃciency ignores
polarization eﬀects and accounts only for impedance matching (the voltage divider

4.2.6 Determining the Sample Temperature by RF Ejection

Spectroscopy

As suggested in equation 4.5, rf ejection spectroscopy can give the temperature of
the sample since it gives the potential energy distribution of the trapped atoms. This
spectrum is diﬀerent from the total energy distribution obtained by dumping the
atoms out of the trap, as done in previous hydrogen experiments [23, 17], or by
saturating the rf transition for the entire sample [81, 82]. The diﬀerence between the
total and potential energy distributions is indicated in ﬁgure 4-8. As outlined above,
the rf ejection spectroscopy technique is free of several complications implicit in the

trap dump technique. RF ejection spectroscopy has been employed to measure the
temperature of the coldest samples of trapped H to date, a factor of 40 colder than
the photon recoil cooling limit.

Figure 4-9 shows the spectrum of a sample that was cooled to T = 30 µK by
rf evaporation. This sample should contain a small condensate, although it is not
visible here. The three calculated spectra in ﬁgure 4-9 assume quantum degeneracy.
Furthermore, they include the measured time response of the detection system, the
measured trap bias, and the measured eﬀective rf ﬁeld strength. Possible distortions,
not considered in the calculations, arise from sample depletion during the rf sweep
and changing detection sensitivity due to nonlinearities in the detection process at
low atom ﬂuxes. This second eﬀect should be small, as suggested by the quality
of the calculated rf ejection spectrum, which ignored nonlinearity. The ﬁrst eﬀect
can be shown to be small by taking a series of such spectra at various rf powers,
thus depleting the sample by various (small) amounts. Of course at lower powers
the signal/noise ratio becomes smaller; the power used for the spectrum in ﬁgure 4-9
involves a compromise between signal size and distortion. The apparent temperature
is shifted no more than 10%.

Determination of sample temperature through rf ejection spectroscopy is limited
by the signal rate, which is proportional to Neject/τspec in equation 4.7. The technique

could be extended to much lower temperatures if the detection eﬃciency is improved.
A practical limitation involves the requirement that the cell walls be cold enough to
support a long atom residence time, and thus high recombination eﬃciency. Because
of rf heating eﬀects, this limitation usually requires the rf power to be reduced for
several seconds before the rf spectrum is obtained. The sample can warm during this
time since the trap depth is not as well deﬁned.

Observation of BEC

In this chapter we describe the ﬁrst observations of Bose-Einstein condensation of
hydrogen.

Our primary diagnostic technique is laser spectroscopy, which we brieﬂy describe
here; detailed descriptions are given by Sandberg [16] and Killian [13] (Killian’s thesis
should be considered a companion to this chapter). With this probe we are able to
monitor the density and temperature of the gas as the temperature is reduced by rf
evaporation. When the gas is cooled into the quantum degenerate regime signatures
of the Bose-Einstein condensate appear in the spectrum; these can be analyzed to
reveal the size and population of the condensate. As anticipated, the condensate is
huge, containing a factor of 50 more atoms than condensates in other experiments,
and having a length on the order of a centimeter. We are able to study the time
evolution of the condensate, which is governed by feeding of the condensate from the
thermal gas. We explore some of the implications of these results for the production
of high-ﬂux coherent atomic beams.

5.1 Laser Spectroscopy of Trapped Hydrogen

Laser spectroscopy of trapped atomic hydrogen has been pursued as both a technique
to study and manipulate a trapped gas, and as a probe of the collection of individual
atoms for metrology and fundamental measurements [24, 16, 14, 83]. We focus here
on spectroscopy as a tool to measure the density and temperature of the trapped gas.
It has been suggested that the coherence properties of Bose-condensed atoms could
be exploited to perform much improved fundamental measurements [84, 85].

The principal transition in hydrogen, 1S-2P , has a large transition rate, but is
diﬃcult to use for sample diagnostics because it has a large linewidth (100 MHz),
it suﬀers from complicated magnetic structure, and it is in the uv (121.6 nm). The
transition has been used by the Amsterdam hydrogen trapping group as a diagnostic
for warm samples, and also for limited laser cooling and laser induced evaporation
[86, 87, 88]. The Doppler eﬀect can be used to measure the sample temperature,
but the short 2P lifetime limits the technique to temperatures above a few mK.
In order to circumvent the short 2P lifetime, the Amsterdam group employed two-

79

photon spectroscopy to the 3S (160 ns) and 3D (16 ns) states [89]. To enhance the
two-photon transition rate, one photon was tuned near the Lyman-α resonance and
the other near the Balmer-α.
In principle the 1S-3S transition could be used for
temperature measurement all the way into the sub-µK regime.

5.1.1 Spectroscopy of the 1S-2S Transition

We employ the 1S-2S transition and drive it with two photons at 243 nm, twice the
Lyman-α wavelength. The 2S state is metastable with lifetime τ0 = 120 ms, and
the natural linewidth is below 1 Hz. The transition thus constitutes a very sensitive
probe, through shifts and broadenings, of the local environment of the atom. As
explained below, the transition can be used to measure the density of the gas, in
addition to the temperature.

To excite the transition the laser beam is retroreﬂected to create a standing wave
in the atom cloud. In this conﬁguration the atom may absorb two photons from the
same beam or one photon from each beam. Absorption of co-propagating photons
involves the Doppler shift, and the excitation is said to be “Doppler-sensitive” (DS).
In the absorption of counter-propagating photons the Doppler eﬀect cancels to ﬁrst
order, and the process is termed “Doppler-free” (DF).

The energy equation for two-photon excitation of an isolated atom from state i
to f , with initial momentum pi and ﬁnal momentum pf = pi + ¯h(k1 + k2), where k1

A complete discussion of the shape of the Doppler-free line in the various regimes
of density and temperature is presented in the thesis of Thomas Killian [13]. We
summarize his discussion by noting that the narrow intrinsic linewidth allows the
spectrum to be used for measuring the density and temperature of the sample. The

which is in reasonable agreement with calculations [91]. The shift was measured for
3 and for temperatures between 100 and 500
densities in the range 2
µK. (For that study the sample densities were measured using the known dipolar
decay rate constant, g, from equation A.19.) The frequency resolution of our laser
system (currently 1 kHz) limits our use of this technique to densities above a few

At low densities the shape of the Doppler-free spectrum is governed by the ﬁnite
interaction time of the laser beam with the atom as the atom traverses the beam
(the cloud of atoms is much larger than the beam diameter). The characteristic
linewidth (at 243 nm) is δ0 = u/2πd0 where u =
2kBT /m is the most probable
speed and d0 is the waist diameter of the beam. The expected lineshape for a cloud
of atoms having a Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution, interacting with a laser
/δ0) for uv
beam with a Gaussian beam proﬁle, is the cusp-shaped S(δ)
laser frequency detuning δ (δ in Hz). The linewidth is proportional to √T , making
this feature a useful probe of the sample temperature. For the beam waist diameter
and laser frequency resolution achieved in these experiments this technique is reliable
above 100 µK. This temperature probe suﬀers from systematic eﬀects arising from
misalignment between the counterpropagating beams and divergence of the beam
over the length of the trap, eﬀects which make the lineshape diﬃcult to interpret. In
an improved apparatus these eﬀects could be better characterized and controlled.

5.1.2 Experimental Technique

The 1S-2S transition is excited by narrowband continuous-wave radiation generated
by frequency doubling the output of a 486 nm dye laser. This laser, which is frequency
stabilized to an isolated Fabry-Perot reference cavity, routinely exhibits a linewidth

81

of 1 kHz and output power of 480 mW. After frequency doubling and spatial ﬁltering
there is typically about 9 mW of uv power in a Gaussian mode available at the window
into the cryostat.

The trapped gas is illuminated by the uv beam as it traverses the symmetry axis
of the trap and is retroreﬂected by a spherical mirror. The beam focus (50 µm waist
radius) is positioned at the minimum of the trapping potential so that maximum
optical intensity overlaps maximum sample density. The atoms are excited during an
illumination interval τexc ∼
500 µs. Atoms in the metastable 2S state are held for a
70 µs while background ﬂuorescence dies away. Then a 10 V/cm
short delay τdelay ∼
10 µs; the 2S state mixes with the 2P ,
electric ﬁeld is applied for a short time τquench ∼
which quickly decays emitting a Lyman-α photon which is counted on a microchannel
plate detector. Only photons which hit the detector during the quenching interval are
considered signal, and so the background count rate is much suppressed. The total
5, limited by detection solid angle (0.13%),
detection eﬃciency should be about 2
transmission through a window (60%) and a Lyman-α ﬁlter (10%), and detector
quantum eﬃciency (estimated at 25%). Actual detection eﬃciency appears to be
about 10 times lower than this estimate, possibly due to contaminants on windows
[13, 92]. The background count rate is between 200 and 700 counts/sec, giving about 8
background counts per second of laser exposure assuming the excitation and detection
timing sequence outlined above. The minimum detectable signal thus corresponds to
106 atoms excited per second of laser excitation. Straightforward improvements

to the optical access should easily yield a factor of ten improvement in detection
eﬃciency.

5.1.3 The 1S-2S Spectrum of a Non-Degenerate Gas

The spectrum of the trapped hydrogen gas slightly above the quantum degenerate
regime is shown in ﬁgure 5-1. As described in section 5.1.1, there are two components
of the spectrum, corresponding to absorption of co- or counter-propagating photons.
The wide, low feature on the right (higher photon energy) is the Doppler-sensitive
peak, and is oﬀset by the recoil shift ∆νR from the intense, narrow Doppler-free
peak on the left. The solid line is the Gaussian lineshape expected for a Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies in a sample at 42 µK. The DS spectrum
maps the velocity distribution through the Doppler shift; only atoms with the proper
velocity v = λ∆ν are Doppler shifted into resonance for a given laser detuning ∆ν =
ν
(ν0 + ∆νR) (ν is the optical frequency of the laser). Thus, only a tiny fraction of
the sample is resonant, and the excitation rate is correspondingly tiny. The fraction
of atoms which are resonant is proportional to the ratio of the excitation linewidth, δ0
2kBT log(2)/mλ2;
from time-of-ﬂight broadening, to the Doppler linewidth ∆D =

The Doppler-free spectrum gives information about the density distribution and

results from Doppler-free excitation and the low broad peak on the right results from
Doppler-sensitive excitation which probes the velocity distribution. The solid line
on the right is the expected Doppler-sensitive spectrum for a nondegenerate sample
at 42 µK. At this low temperature the recoil-shifted Doppler-sensitive line is clearly
separated from the Doppler-free line. The error bars are statistical. The ratio of
peak heights should be taken as only a rough indication of the transition rate ratios
because of variations in laser power and beam alignment.

spectra in ﬁgure 5-2, just three of many successive spectra that were measured as the
density of the sample slowly decayed. The initial spectra exhibit a large shift, arising
from the cold-collision frequency shift at high density. The inhomogeneous density in
the trap causes a broadening of the spectrum as well. As the sample density decreases,
the shift and broadening also decrease. At low density, where the density-dependent
shift is negligible, the exponential lineshape characteristic of transit time broadening
is evident. The frequency shift of the spectra of high density samples is used to obtain
the sample density, and the width of the transit-time broadened line is related to the
sample temperature.

5.2 Cooling into the Degenerate Regime

Armed with an eﬃcient cooling method (rf evaporation) and a sensitive probe of
sample density and temperature (spectroscopy), we are equipped to push toward the

quantum degenerate regime. The trap is loaded as described in section 1.3, and
the sample is cooled by magnetic ﬁeld saddlepoint evaporation. The currents in
the magnetic coils that create the trapping potential are ramped to slowly change
the trap from the deep, long, open shape used for loading the atoms to a short,
tightly compressed, shallow trap from which rf evaporation is commenced. Figure 5-3
indicates the process. In this section we discuss the path through density-temperature
space taken by the sample as it is cooled into the quantum degenerate regime.

5.2.1 Cooling Paths

Previous attempts to achieve BEC in hydrogen were thwarted by ineﬃcient evapora-
tion at the lowest temperatures. In order to verify that we have solved this problem,
the progress of the sample through phase space (density-temperature space) is mon-
itored as the sample is cooled. We ﬁnd that the sample is cooled eﬃciently. We also
ﬁnd and explore the phase boundary where the sample undergoes phase separation
into a condensate and normal gas. This ﬁrst evidence for phase transition behavior
is described below.

Figure 5-3: Schematic diagram of trap shape as sample is loaded and evaporatively
cooled to BEC. Room temperature molecular hydrogen (upper left diagram) is cooled
to 275 mK by cryogenic techniques. It is dissociated, and the atoms are loaded into an
open, long trap that is about 500 mK deep (upper right diagram). The magnetic ﬁeld
in the ρ
z plane is shown. Note the very diﬀerent scales for the radial coordinate ρ
and the axial coordinate z. During trap loading, the atoms settle into the region of
low ﬁeld at the center of the trap. The sample is then cooled by magnetic saddlepoint
evaporation. It is compressed radially and axially into a trap that is nearly harmonic
along the z axis and predominantly linear along the radial axis (lower right diagram).
It is this trap shape that is labeled “A” or “B” (see section 5.2.1). RF evaporation
is used to further cool the sample while the trap shape remains ﬁxed (lower left
diagram). The entire cooling process takes about 5 minutes.

A series of measurements were made to map the sample’s trajectory through phase
space as it was cooled into the quantum regime. Identical samples were cooled into a
trap of depth ǫt/kB = 1.1 mK. This process used magnetic saddlepoint evaporation
exclusively. The trap shape was then held constant while the trap depth was reduced
by rf evaporation. (Three trap shapes will be discussed in this chapter, A, A′, and

evaporation halted. After rf evaporation was completed, the sample density was
measured using the cold-collision frequency shift of the DF spectrum as described
above. The densities thus measured are shown in ﬁgure 5-4. The density initially
increases as the trap depth (and thus temperature) is reduced because the atoms are
conﬁned to a smaller volume closer to the bottom of the trap. Some atoms are lost
through evaporation, but the good eﬃciency of evaporative cooling leads to overall
phase space compression. The cooling eﬃciency parameter γ = d log D/d log N (the

At a trap depth of about ǫt/kB = 280 µK the phase space trajectory exhibits
a dramatic kink. Further cooling leads to decreasing density in the normal gas;
apparently population is being rapidly removed. The location of the kink and the
slope of the subsequent trajectory agree well with the BEC phase transition line,
nc = 2.612(2πmkBT )3/2/h3 assuming a ratio of trap depth to temperature of η =
ǫt/kBT
6, which is reasonable. The “excluded region” above the line has the
following interpretation: as the sample is cooled, the thermal cloud cannot support a
peak density above nc; extra atoms are transferred to the condensate. The condensate
is not directly observed in these measurements because its density is so large (as
discussed in section 5.3.1) that its spectrum is shifted far away from the spectrum of
the thermal cloud.

The magnetic trap shape used for these experiments (trap shape A) was chosen as
a compromise between high radial compression and adequate magnetic saddlepoint
evaporation eﬃciency. High radial compression is desirable because the correspond-
ingly higher densities allow BEC to be reached at a higher temperature. As discussed

1The evaporation path was not optimized before most of the data presented in this chapter was

obtained. For future studies an optimization of the functional form of the path is desirable.

in section 5.2.2, evaporation and the approach to BEC should be more eﬃcient at
higher temperatures because the ratio of “good” to “bad” collisions is more favor-
able. On the other hand, high radial compression is undesirable because the magnetic
ﬁeld saddlepoint evaporation process (see ﬁgure 5-3) that cools and compresses the
sample into the tight trap is less eﬃcient. As discussed in section 2.1, tight radial
compression leads to more regular motion of the trapped atoms, and thus to reduced
evaporation dimensionality.

A more open trap, trap B, has also been used. A typical phase space trajectory is
shown by the ﬁlled circles in ﬁgure 5-4 . The evaporation was done more slowly, with
maximum duration d = 55 s, but was otherwise identical to the path described above.

apparatus and their implications for the choice of evaporation path.

As shown in section A.2.2, evaporation is more eﬃcient in hydrogen at higher tem-
peratures. There the ratio of “good” collisions to “bad” collisions is higher. “Good”
collisions are those which lead to cooling, and they occur at a rate Γevap ∝

√T is higher at higher temperatures. More phase space compression
Γevap/Γdip ∝
can be accomplished per atom lost from the trap. This higher eﬃciency makes it
desirable to do most of the phase space compression at higher temperatures.

The competing consideration is that full evaporation dimensionality, and thus eﬃ-
ciency, can only be realized using the rf evaporation technique (instead of saddlepoint
evaporation), and this technique is only usable for trap depths less that about 1 mK.
Creation of deeper traps requires higher frequency and higher power rf ﬁelds. These
heat the current apparatus too much.

In an ideal apparatus the rf evaporation would be initiated at much higher tem-
peratures, phase space compression would lead to higher sample densities, and the
bulk of the cooling and compression would be accomplished more quickly and more
eﬃciently than in the present experiments. The sample could then be cooled at nearly
constant phase space density to cross the BEC phase transition line at the desired
density (one may desire smaller densities with correspondingly longer lifetimes). In
the experiments described here more phase space compression was accomplished at
lower temperatures than is optimal because of the heating eﬀects of the rf power used
for evaporation. Improvements to the rf parts of the apparatus should allow larger
condensates to be created.

To test these ideas about eﬃciency we cooled to BEC in two traps, A and B
described above. (These labels refer to the ﬁeld conﬁguration at low temperature.
3)
Identical trap shapes are used for initial trap loading (T = 40 mK, n0 = 2
and the ﬁrst stage of saddlepoint evaporative cooling. The trap shape is converted
into A or B during the last stage of the saddlepoint evaporation.) The evaporation
occurred along diﬀerent paths for the two traps, but at the end the phase space density
was nearly identical; the condensate population was about 109 atoms for both traps.
One expects path B to have lower overall evaporation eﬃciency (and thus fewer
condensate atoms) because more of the phase space compression is accomplished
at lower temperatures (where the evaporation eﬃciency is lower because the ratio
of good to bad collisions is less favorable). On the other hand, if rf evaporation
is more eﬃcient than saddlepoint evaporation, then one expects path B to result
in better evaporation eﬃciency, and thus more condensate atoms, since more of the

1013 cm−

×

88

phase space compression is accomplished with the more eﬃcient rf evaporation. Since
the two paths result in the same ﬁnal phase space density, we conclude that the two
eﬀects cancel. This necessitates that rf evaporation be more eﬃcient than saddlepoint
evaporation. It would be advantageous to use rf evaporation for more of the cooling.

5.3 Spectroscopic Study of the Degenerate Gas

When the sample is cooled into the quantum degenerate regime we observe signa-
tures of the condensate in the 1S-2S spectrum of the gas. In this section we discuss
two of these signatures from which we extract the chemical potential and tempera-
ture. Knowledge of these thermodynamic parameters allows us to estimate several
properties of the system.

Bose condensation involves the macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy quan-
tum state of the system. In a trap this state is concentrated at the minimum of the
trapping potential, and it has very small kinetic energy, given approximately by the
Heisenberg momentum-position uncertainty principle. In the Doppler-sensitive spec-
trum, which maps the momentum distribution, one would expect an intense line at
zero detuning from the recoil shift ∆νR, rising above the background spectrum [16].
Figure 5-5 shows the DS spectrum of the normal gas and the condensate together.

Instead of appearing as a very narrow, intense peak centered at zero detuning,
however, the line is red-shifted and broadened by the very high and inhomogeneous
density of the condensate. This same eﬀect is observed in the DF line, displayed in
ﬁgure 5-6. The condensate spectrum has a very diﬀerent shape and shift than the
normal gas spectrum, implying very high densities and a density distribution that is
diﬀerent from the normal gas.

The spectroscopic technique of probing the condensate diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
the spatial imaging techniques used by other groups, providing somewhat comple-
mentary information. The probe is not limited to length scales larger than the spa-
tial resolution of the imaging optics, and so detection of very small features, such
as condensate “droplets” [93] would be possible. Also, we are able to measure the
momentum distribution of the normal gas in situ. Finally, the coherence length of
the condensate can, in principle, be obtained directly from the broadening of the
spectrum, as recently demonstrated in Na by Stenger et al. [94]. Because of the
large condensate densities, we are only able to put a very small lower bound on the
coherence length for our H condensates.

5.3.1 Peak Condensate Density

The DF spectrum of the condensate, shown in ﬁgure 5-6, can be understood using a
local density approximation; atoms excited from diﬀerent regions of the condensate
exhibit correspondingly diﬀerent frequency shifts. The signal size S at a given de-
tuning ∆ is proportional to the number of condensate atoms on a surface of constant
density ncond = 2∆/χc, where χc is the (two photon sum) frequency shift per unit
density for excitation out of the condensate. (The relation of χc to χm, the measured

expected for a Thomas-Fermi wavefunction in a harmonic trap, when the dominant
spectral broadening is the cold-collision frequency shift. The temperature of the Bose
calculation was chosen to ﬁt the observed spectrum. The condensate spectrum is
a composite of data from the ﬁrst sweep of each of three loadings of the trap; the

equation 5.3, will be addressed in section 5.6. Although there is signiﬁcant ambiguity,
it is clear that either χc = χm or χc = χm/2.) The spectrum calculated using this
local density approximation in a harmonic potential is parameterized only by the
peak shift, ∆p, and the overall scaling factor S0. The normalized spectrum is

A quantum mechanical approach may also be used to understand this spectrum,
as developed in the thesis of Killian [13]. Before excitation, an atom is in the 1S
electronic state, and its motional quantum state is the condensate wavefunction.
After excitation the atom is in the 2S electronic state; its motional state has been
projected onto the motional eigenstates of the modiﬁed potential it experiences. This
new potential, a sum of the trap potential and the mean-ﬁeld interaction energy
for a 2S atom in a 1S cloud, is very diﬀerent because the new mean-ﬁeld energy
has a diﬀerent sign and is much stronger. The parabolic condensate density proﬁle,

91

with density much larger than the background thermal cloud density, gives rise to
an attractive parabolic potential for the 2S atoms. The motional quantum states
the 2S atom ﬁnds available are simple harmonic oscillator states. The excitation
spectrum is the probability of exciting atoms from the condensate wavefunction to
each of these 2S motional states. This probability is the wavefunction overlap, which
is straightforward to calculate. Calculations by Killian show very good agreement
between the quantum and local density approximation treatments of the spectrum.
The peak condensate density indicates the number of atoms in the condensate,
given a knowledge of the trap shape. (This data is for trap shape A′). Using equation

5.3.2 Sample Temperature

The temperature and chemical potential of the trapped gas allows a full thermo-
dynamical description of the system, assuming a near equilibrium situation. The
chemical potential was obtained above. The temperature is extracted here using two
methods, both of which suﬀer from uncomfortably large uncertainties. Nevertheless,
in this section we characterize the temperature with uncertainty on the 20% level.

The primary thermometry tool is the DS spectrum of the normal gas. As described
in section 5.1.1 above, the spectrum is a map of the velocity distribution of the sample.
Far from quantum degeneracy this (classical) velocity distribution is Gaussian, and

dramatically. The shot noise on our measurements is too big to allow a precise
comparison between the shapes of the classical and quantum spectra, but evidence of
the eﬀect is noted in the spectrum below.

Although it is interesting to probe the Bose-Einstein velocity distribution and
compare it to the Maxwell-Boltzmann, the disadvantage presented by the eﬀect is
the dependence of the spectrum on the eﬀective chemical potential, which leads to
measurement uncertainties. The laser beam geometry and alignment must enter
the interpretation of the spectrum, and these factors are diﬃcult to measure directly.
The alignment of the beam with the sample is veriﬁed by translating the trap radially
relative to the laser beam while exciting the condensate. The condensate is used as a
precise alignment marker in the center of the trap. With this technique we can center
the trap radially over the laser beam to within about a half a beam radius (20 µm),
small compared to the thermal radius of the normal gas (100 µm). Systematic axial
adjustment is not possible in the current apparatus. The uncertainty in the axial
position of the beam focus is about 2 cm, about half the length of the normal gas
cloud.

To demonstrate the technique we study here the DS spectrum of a sample in
trap B, in the quantum degenerate regime. Plotted in ﬁgure 5-7 is the DS spectrum,
obtained immediately after forced rf evaporation is completed; the trap depth is
ǫt = 214 µK. The ﬁrst step in the analysis is to ﬁt the wings of the spectrum with
a Gaussian, an analytic form that is simple to ﬁt. This ﬁt is shown in the upper
panel along with the spectra expected for temperatures higher and lower than the ﬁt
result by one standard deviation. Next, spectra are calculated assuming a truncated
Bose-Einstein velocity distribution, as described in appendix E. These calculations
take into account the trap shape, trap depth, laser beam waist, and alignment of laser
beam relative to the center of the trap (we choose ideal alignment here: beam focus
at center of trap, beam aligned with the z axis). The calculations are done for a range
of temperatures. The calculated spectra are ﬁt in the wings by a Gaussian, and the

A systematic error can arise if the laser beam focus is not aligned in the trap
as expected. The beam would be probing a region with eﬀective chemical potential
diﬀerent from expected. Three beam parameters aﬀect the alignment: the beam
waist, the radial position of the beam, and the axial position of the beam. We know
the waist radius to within 30% because of the aperture constraints encountered while
transporting the beam into the cryostat and back out. The radial position of the
beam is measured by translating the trap, and is veriﬁed by the presence of the
condensate spike in the center of the spectrum. The axial position of the beam is
not as important because the divergence length is on the order of the length of the
sample. We conclude that uncertainties in the beam parameters should not cause a
major systematic eﬀect compared to the shot noise of the current measurements.

≃

The other indication of sample temperature comes from the phase space diagram,
ﬁgure 5-4. For trap B, the phase boundary appears at a ratio of trap depth to
temperature of η
6.5. This would indicate that the temperature of the sample in
ﬁgure 5-7 should be 33 µK. A systematic error arises, however, in the extraction of
the peak density of the normal gas (plotted in ﬁgure 5-4) from the DF spectra. The
lineshape of the spectrum changes signiﬁcantly near the onset of quantum degeneracy,
as detailed in section 5.5. This systematic error could shift the apparent density higher
by up to roughly 30% (measured density higher than actual density), translating to
a decrease in the indicated temperature by 20% (measured temperature lower than
actual temperature). This adjustment shifts the expected sample temperature to
40 µK, within the uncertainty of the DS measurement.

We note that the DS spectrum does not constitute an absolute measure of the
sample temperature in the regimes of quantum degeneracy and/or shallow traps (low
η). On the contrary, the details of the trap shape and laser beam geometry are
folded into the spectrum. In spite of these diﬃculties, reliable temperatures can be
extracted.
In addition, we observe in ﬁgure 5-7 hints of quantum perturbation of
the momentum distribution of the normal gas, a subject which could be studied with
improved signal rate.

Our temperature derivation procedure could be complicated by a non-uniform
temperature in the sample. Loss of atoms from the trap occurs mostly in the con-
densate when the condensate density is high. As explained in section 2.3.2.1, the
eﬀective heating rate of the system is thus higher in the center 10% of the length of
the trap where the condensate lives. Near the ends of the thermal gas the heat load
is lower, and conceivably the temperature could be lower.

In order for a temperature gradient to exist, the characteristic mean free path
must be less than the length of the sample. At the highest densities achieved, the

5.3.3 Condensate Fraction

The fraction of atoms in the condensate can be obtained using two methods. First,
given knowledge of the trap shape and sample temperature, we compute the pop-
ulation of the normal gas using equation C.7 (which assumes thermal equilibrium).
We then compare to the condensate population computed above using equation 2.14.
The trap shape parameters α and β cancel in the comparison, and the only quantities
that enter are measured: the temperature, peak condensate density np, and trap bias
energy θ. The population ratio f = Nc/Nt is given by equation 2.18. We use f to plot
the condensate fraction, F = f /(1 + f ), in ﬁgure 5-8 for the trap depth, bias energy,
and range of temperatures applicable to trap B. The condensate fraction for trap B

Hijmans et al. [45].

We have found the condensate fraction just after crossing the BEC phase bound-
ary; condensate fractions could be determined at other points on the phase diagram,
but the high loss from the condensate depletes the system as lower temperatures are
attained, reducing the achievable fraction. Also, we are considering equilibrium con-
densate fractions. As explained in section 5.4, the condensate is fed from the thermal
cloud. An extremely high condensate fraction could be created by simply removing
all the thermal atoms by rf ejection, but the resulting condensate would decay rather
quickly.

The other method of ﬁnding the condensate fraction exploits the spectrum more
directly; the population of the normal gas is proportional to the integrated signal of
the normal component of the DF (or DS) resonance. This integral is compared to
the integral of the condensate portion of the spectrum, and adjustments are made
to account for the partial illumination of the normal gas by the laser beam. (The
condensate diameter is signiﬁcantly smaller than the beam diameter, but the normal
gas diameter is signiﬁcantly larger.) The fraction computed with this technique [13]
is 2.2+1
0.5%. The two methods give consistent results; an increased signal rate would

reduce the large temperature uncertainties and make the measurements useful.

5.4 Time Evolution of the Degenerate Gas

Because the condensate fraction is small, there are enough atoms in the normal gas
to continuously replenish the condensate for many seconds. As a ﬁrst look at this
feeding process we study the time evolution of the condensate.

Simple estimates of time scales reveal that the condensate lives much longer than
one might expect in the absence of replenishment. The large condensate density leads
to fast condensate decay. The characteristic time an atom spends in the condensate
before undergoing an inelastic collision is τ2,c = Nc/ ˙N2,c, less than a second for the
condensates described in table 5.2. However, the condensate is observed to live for
more than 15τ2,c, indicating that feeding of the condensate by the thermal cloud
occurs quickly. In this section we examine the time evolution of the condensate. We
ﬁnd that a simple equilibrium model reproduces the data.

To measure the condensate dynamics many sequential condensate spectra have
been measured. Figure 5-9 shows part of a series of such spectra, obtained using
DS absorption, for trap B. The solid curve is a ﬁt to all the data in the series, with
adjustable parameters being the peak condensate density in each scan, the overall
amplitude scaling factors for the condensate and normal gas, the temperature of the
sample, and a time constant for the temperature to change [92]. The peak condensate
density decreases only slowly in time, implying feeding of the condensate from the
normal gas. For this feeding to occur, the normal gas must be losing atoms, and

The time evolution of the condensate can also be probed using the DF spectrum,
as shown in ﬁgure 5-10. Similar results are obtained. Note the systematic misﬁt

suggest that the density distribution of the condensate is more complicated than that

rate precludes further study at this time.

Figure 5-11 shows the peak condensate density as a function of time, obtained in
two ways. In the lower panel sequential spectra are taken of the same condensate, and
so losses induced by the laser beam cause the sample to decay more quickly than it
would without the extraneous one body loss rate. The upper panel reveals the latter

A computer model has been developed to study the time evolution of the degen-
erate system. As described in appendix F, this model incorporates dipolar decay and
evaporative cooling, and assumes thermal equilibrium and a Thomas-Fermi conden-
sate wavefunction. The good agreement between the model (solid line in ﬁgure 5-11)
and the data indicates that the system is reasonably well understood. An important
result of the model is that the temperature of the sample changes by 20-30% during
the 15 s condensate lifetime. This behavior is shown in the inset to ﬁgure 5-11.

The low condensate fraction and long condensate lifetime in this system suggest
that the H condensate could be an excellent source for a bright atom laser. On the
order of 108 atoms/s could be continuously coupled out of the condensate for 10-20 s
per loading of the trap (continuous loading schemes could be imagined to circumvent
this limitation). The outcoupling could be accomplished by photon recoil as atoms
are excited to the 2S state [25] or by Raman output coupling, as demonstrated in Na
by Kozuma et al. [96]. The beam thus formed should be diﬀraction limited; the large
condensate dimensions and short de Broglie wavelengths achievable in this system
should result in a very low divergence beam. The atoms in the beam could be in the
metastable 2S state, which could be useful because of the large energy available for
driving chemistry on a surface the atoms hits.

5.5 Signature of Quantum Degeneracy in Spec-

trum of Normal Gas

The direct condensate signatures presented so far are expected from simple theories
of BEC. One does not expect the DF spectrum of the normal gas to be much aﬀected
by the condensate. Nevertheless, a dramatic signature appears.
Simple arguments suggest that the for this experiment (µ

kBT ) the normal
gas should be only very weakly perturbed by quantum degeneracy. The condensate
volume is about a factor of 103 smaller than the volume of the normal gas, so the
high condensate density should not aﬀect the normal gas much.

≪

In fact, measurements of the DF spectrum of the normal gas in the degenerate
regime reveal a surprise. The lineshape is markedly asymmetric below the transition,
but largely symmetric above, as shown in ﬁgure 5-12. Below the transition much
of the spectral support is red-shifted to large detunings. These detunings, if simply
interpreted as cold-collision frequency shift with the measured shift-to-density ratio
χm, correspond to sample densities a factor of two higher than expected for a degen-
erate Bose gas in equilibrium at a temperature which is reasonable for the trap. Note

102

Figure 5-12: Doppler-free spectra of normal gas showing asymmetry in quantum
degenerate regime. The spectra in the upper panel correspond to samples above
quantum degeneracy; those in the lower panel are for samples that are degenerate.
The trap shapes are identical, and the trap depths are indicated. Note the diﬀerence

that χm was measured in samples far from quantum degeneracy. If χ were larger by
a factor of two for the part of the cloud in the bottom of the trap where the eﬀective
chemical potential is small, then the asymmetric lineshape would make qualitative
sense. The atoms in the highest density (red-shifted) part of the spectrum would tend
to be shifted even further (because their χ is larger) than their low density counter-
parts. However, no quantitative theory has been formulated predicting that χ should
vary for the normal gas as quantum degeneracy is approached.

103

5.6 Density Shift for Excitation out of the Con-

densate and the Normal Gas

A thorough treatment of the relation between χc and χm has been undertaken by
Killian [13]. He concludes that χc = χm/2 because exchange eﬀects should be present
in the normal gas, but absent in a condensate. Here we discuss experimental evidence
which suggests that perhaps χc = χm.

Time Evolution As explained in section 5.4, the condensate is observed to persist
for many seconds.
Integration, over the lifetime of the condensate, of the rate of
atom loss through dipolar decay in the condensate is very sensitive to χc because
the loss rate is proportional to n7/2
; a factor of two diﬀerence in χc translates to a
factor of 11 change in the loss rate. If we take χc = χm/2 then the number of atoms
lost, Nc,lost from equation 5.9, is as large as the total original population of the trap!
The estimate here would be ﬂawed if the trap parameters (α, β, θ) applicable to the
condensate were somehow diﬀerent from those for the thermal gas. This is unlikely,
as noted in discussion of the trap shape in appendix G.

p

DS-DF Comparison Doppler-sensitive excitation results in excited atoms moving
at the recoil velocity vrecoil ∼
3 m/s. These motional states are very diﬀerent from the
low energy motional states inhabited during Doppler-free excitation. Furthermore,
the high velocity of the recoiling atoms implies that motional coherence between
the ground and excited states of the atom is very quickly lost during excitation,
a situation conceivably diﬀerent for DF excitation. Nevertheless, the condensate
spectra obtained using the two diﬀerent techniques are identical to within the (small)
statistical uncertainty.

Spectroscopic Measurement of Condensate Fraction The condensate frac-
tion measured spectroscopically agrees well with the fraction one computes from the
population in the condensate, assuming χc = χm.
If χc = χm/2 then the calcu-
lated condensate fraction is 25/2

technique.

Conclusion

6.1 Summary and Signiﬁcance of this Work

We have created Bose-Einstein condensates of atomic hydrogen, culminating a long
research eﬀort. In the process we have conﬁrmed that, as explained by Surkov et al.
[32], the reduced dimensionality of the evaporation process was the crippling factor
in previous eﬀorts to reach this goal in our lab [29] and in Amsterdam [30]. Our
condensates, while huge compared to other condensates, are only a small fraction
of the total trap population, a prediction by Hijmans et al. [45] for spin-polarized
hydrogen in equilibrium. We have this huge number of atoms in the trap because of
the cryogenic loading technique we use, which can be scaled to arbitrarily large trap
sizes (consistent with the scaling arguments in section 2.3.4). This cryogenic loading
method has been generalized for arbitrary paramagnetic atoms and molecules by
Doyle and coworkers [97, 98, 99, 100], and therefore it should be possible to create
big condensates of arbitrary bosons. The high condensation ﬂux we observe (109
atoms condensed per second for 10 s) should be useful in creating a bright atom laser.
In addition, we have added another atom to the list of Bose-condensed species. In
section 2.3 we explored many diﬀerences between the hydrogen system and the alkali
metal gases that have been condensed so far. Finally, we have developed and applied
spectroscopy as a new probe of condensates.

6.2 Improvements to the Apparatus

The experiments described in this thesis were frustrated by several factors. Changes
in the apparatus could allow us to investigate several new areas.

One of the most straightforward improvements is to reduce the stray electric ﬁelds
in the cell. Large ﬁelds reduce the lifetime of the 2S atomic state by Stark quenching;
the lifetime in a static electric ﬁeld E (neglecting the natural lifetime) is [101]

τSQ =

2

475 V/cm
E

 

!

1.6 ns.

105

(6.1)

In the current cell, with its non-conducting walls, static charges reduce the 2S lifetime
to 0.1-1 ms, but in previous experiments in a metal cell [25] we have observed lifetimes
on the order of the natural lifetime, τ0 = 120 ms. It should be possible to reduce stray
ﬁelds by more than an order of magnitude by coating the inside of the plastic cell with
a thin metallic ﬁlm. Longer 2S lifetimes would allow us to address questions such
as how interactions with the condensate aﬀect the 2S lifetime. Also, low stray ﬁelds
would allow atoms ejected from the condensate in an atomic beam to travel many
centimeters toward the detector before decay (see section 6.3.3). Reduced stray ﬁelds
would allow optical excitation to remain coherent for many milliseconds, allowing
interesting studies of the excitation process. The large stray ﬁelds increase indirectly
the background counts in our data: because of the short lifetime, fewer atoms can
be accumulated in the 2S level before the detection pulse, and so more detection
pulses must be used to accumulate the same signal. Each detection pulse increases
the number of background counts. Reduction of stray ﬁelds would thus increase our
sensitivity.

Another straightforward improvement is to reduce the heat load on the refrigerator
caused by high power in the rf coils. The rf evaporation could then begin at higher
sample temperatures, and more eﬃcient cooling would undoubtedly result. More
atoms in the condensate would increase the signal rates, and more detailed studies of
the condensate would be possible. The heat load created by the rf coils appears to
not be a consequence of the ﬁelds themselves, but rather of the system that conveys
the power to the coils. If the coils were thermally anchored to the 4.2 K 4He bath the
heating of the refrigerator should be dramatically reduced.

Better knowledge of the trap shape and laser alignment could allow more detailed
studies of the inﬂuence of quantum degeneracy on the momentum distribution of the
sample, as developed in section 6.3.2. As noted by Killian [13], better knowledge of
trap and laser geometry would also allow more accurate measurements of χ. We could
better understand the sizes of the condensates we produce (recall how in section 5.4
the 20% error on χm translates into nearly a factor of two uncertainty in the number
of condensate atoms lost during the lifetime of the condensate). The evidence for
χc = χm presented in section 5.6 could then be either bolstered or refuted, resulting
in better understanding of the system.

The experiments probing the condensate, described in chapter 5, suﬀer from low
signal rate. Straightforward improvements to the apparatus should allow at least a
factor of 10 increase in detection solid angle, thus allowing studies at higher time
resolution to be feasible. Condensate formation and feeding could be studied in more
detail. The detection solid angle could be improved by moving the cold atoms into a
short trap formed by small currents in thin coils. This small trap could be surrounded
by Lyman-α detectors.

6.3 Suggestions for Experiments

The success of the experiments described in this thesis has fertilized thinking about
many new experiments that could be done. In this section we discuss several of these

ideas.

6.3.1 Creating Bigger Bose Condensates

Nearly any experiment is easier with a larger condensate, and so here we discuss
strategies for putting more atoms into a hydrogen condensate.

First, more atoms could be initially loaded into the trap. We do not currently

possibilities for loading more eﬃciently from the discharge. In addition to increasing
the loading eﬃciency, one could also simply increase the physical volume of the trap
by making it longer and of larger diameter. One should be able to load a factor of
four more atoms by scaling up the apparatus using available technology.

−

The overall phase space compression eﬃciency exponent for cooling from loading
conditions to BEC is γ =
1.5, which is small (see section A.2.3). Improvements to
the cooling eﬃciency could be made using two strategies. The ﬁrst is to commence
rf evaporation earlier in the cooling cycle. The second is to increase the ratio of good
collisions to bad collisions. It is probable that the admixture of an alkali “moderator”
atom “M” in the sample could dramatically increase the eﬀective collision rate without
signiﬁcantly increasing the dipolar decay rate [51]. Presumably the cross-section for
H-M collisions would be much greater than the anomalously low H-H cross-section.
Finally, improvements could be made to the cooling procedure that do not require
any changes to the apparatus. Instead of using the rf cooling paths shown in ﬁgure
5-4, the sample could ﬁrst be compressed at constant trap depth, the depth being
set by the highest rf frequency usable in the apparatus. Phase space compression
would be accomplished at higher temperature, and thus more eﬃciently. After this
compression the sample could be cooled to BEC at high density.

6.3.2 Probing the Velocity Distribution of the Normal Com-

ponent of a Degenerate Gas

In section 5.3.2 we described the inﬂuence of quantum degeneracy on the velocity dis-
tribution of the normal gas. The expected spectrum is narrower and more cusp-shaped
than for a classical gas at the same temperature. Here we consider an experiment
designed to compare these spectra.

In order to ensure that the two samples (classical and quantum) being probed
have the same temperature, we propose to use a single sample, but probe two parts
of it. The inhomogeneous trapping potential serves to reduce the sample density
(and thus the local chemical potential) in regions far from the deepest point in the
trap. Classical behavior can be observed in a gas containing a condensate when the
kBT /α from the trap axis (for an IP trap
probe laser is translated a distance ρp ≫
with T
θ/kB). The beam diameter should be small compared to the translation
distance, a condition that is easy to fulﬁll in an open trap (small α).

The signal rate is dramatically reduced by the small densities far from the middle

6.3.3 Creation of an Atom Laser

Atoms excited to the 2S state by co-propagating photons receive a momentum kick
pr = 2h/λ where λ = 243 nm is the excitation wavelength. The atoms leave the exci-
tation region with the recoil velocity vr = 3.28 m/s added vectorially to their initial
velocity. In the normal gas there is a wide distribution of velocities, so only a tiny
fraction are Doppler-shifted into resonance for a given detuning. In the condensate,
however, the velocity distribution is very narrow, and one might expect to interact
optically with all the condensate atoms at the same laser tuning. Atoms excited
out of the (coherent) condensate by a laser beam with a long coherence time should
constitute a coherent atomic beam. The divergence of this beam of atoms should
be diﬀraction limited by the size of the excitation region. Such a scheme has been
demonstrated by Kozuma et al. [96] using Raman pulses.

Unfortunately, several complications arise. First, the condensate spectrum is
broadened by the cold-collision frequency shifts arising from the high and inhomoge-
neous condensate density. Since these shifts are much greater than the laser linewidth,
the laser only interacts with a small fraction of the condensate for a given detuning.
(One can imagine eﬃcient methods of broadening the laser linewidth to match the
condensate linewidth [102], resulting in excitation of all the condensate atoms, but
this broadening would write decoherence onto the ejected atoms.) Since the optical
radiation only excites atoms from regions of a given density (corresponding to the
detuning), the excitation region can be quite small, and the divergence of the beam
is enlarged. For example, atoms excited by a laser beam of linewidth 2 kHz that
is tuned to the peak condensate density will come from a region of diameter on the
2 [103].
order of ωexc = 1 µm. The resulting divergence angle is h/prπωexc = 4
The situation is more complicated when the laser is detuned to interact with atoms
in regions of intermediate density. Here the excitation occurs on a shell; interesting
diﬀraction eﬀects should occur.

10−

×

As the 2S atoms propagate with recoil velocity vr, the potential surface they ex-
perience is strongly perturbed by the strong attractive mean ﬁeld potential created
by the high condensate density. The depth of this potential for the peak condensate
densities listed in table 5.2 is on the order of 50 µK. The depth is small compared
to the 650 µK of recoil kinetic energy, so the atom has enough energy to leave the
condensate. However, the depth is much larger than the energy in the radial coor-
dinates, µ/kB = 2 µK. One expects focusing eﬀects as the recoiling atoms leave the

108

condensate.

The 1S-2S excitation process does not eﬀect the hyperﬁne state of the atom; the
recoiling atoms are still in the d-state, and are trapped. As the atoms move toward
the magnetic barrier that forms the end of the trap they slow down. Dephasing also
occurs because the integrated action for slightly diﬀerent atomic trajectories quickly
becomes quite diﬀerent in the mountainous potential surface the atoms explore as
they leave the trapping region. In order to circumvent these problems of slowing and
dephasing we propose to ﬂatten the potential surface: we put the atoms in a magnetic
ﬁeld insensitive state by driving the d-a transition for the 2S atoms. The transition
can be driven selectively for only the 2S atoms because the hyperﬁne splitting of the
2S state is 23 = 8 times smaller than the 1S hyperﬁne splitting of 1420 MHz. One
might be concerned that the rf ﬁeld would drive d-c state transitions in the cold cloud
of 1S atoms, and thus change the eﬀective trap depth. This does not occur because
the frequency is too large (178 MHz corresponds to a trap depth of 8.5 mK). The
a-state 2S atoms are free to fall out of the trapping region. In the current apparatus
the atoms can fall a height h = 20 cm before hitting a window. This should take a
time τf all = (
r ) = 56 ms for atoms with downward directed
recoil velocity, and τf all = (vr/g)(1 +
r ) = 790 ms for those with upward
directed recoil velocity. Here g is the acceleration of gravity. We do not expect to
detect the atoms launched upward because the natural lifetime (120 ms) is too short,
and because, in the current apparatus, the atoms will hit a surface before reaching
the peak of their 55 cm high trajectory.

Detection of the atomic beam could be accomplished by quenching the atoms
with an applied electric ﬁeld pulse when the atoms are at the bottom of the cell
near the detector. To estimate the signal size, we compare to the signal obtained
when the atoms are not allowed to move very far before detection, the experimental
procedure for ﬁgure 5-5. We expect a reduction in the number of ﬂuorescing atoms
0.63 because of decay during the transit time τf all. We expect a factor
by e−
of two further reduction because only 1/2 the atoms have downward-directed recoil
velocity. We expect an increase in signal because the detection solid angle is greater
near the bottom of the cell. With the current cell design we should be able to achieve
a factor of seven increase in detection eﬃciency, but with straightforward extensions
of the cell closer to the detector this factor could be another factor of ten larger.
Neglecting this improvement, we expect the atoms in the atomic beam to yield about
the same signal size as observed in ﬁgure 5-5. The experiment is thus feasible in a cell
identical to the current one, but a conductive coating to reduce stray electric ﬁelds is
essential.

In addition to observing an atomic beam ejected from the sample, another in-
teresting experiment would be a study of collisional quenching of the 2S atoms as
they move through the high density condensate. One might expect collisional de-
excitation to occur on a time scale comparable to the characteristic collision time:
τcol = 1/npσ2S
700 µs. A brief study indicated no collisional quenching
on the sub-millisecond time scale, but the study should be repeated for longer times.
Reduction of the stray ﬁelds would allow this.

6.3.4 Measuring the Condensate Density through Dipolar

Decay

In the experiments described in chapter 5 the condensate density was measured spec-
troscopically, but confusion arises around a factor of two in the conversion constant χc
that relates frequency shift to sample density. We propose an independent measure
of condensate density which should resolve the ambiguity. The proposed measure-
ment exploits two-body dipolar decay, which proceeds at a well known rate in the
condensate [44]. If the condensate density distribution is well approximated by the
Thomas-Fermi proﬁle in equation 2.13, then the characteristic loss rate is given by
equation 2.15. Using equation 2.14 we ﬁnd that the peak shift (frequency shift of
maximally shifted part of the spectrum) should decay in time as

∆p(t) =

∆p,0
1 + 4g∆p,0
35χc

t

(6.3)

where ∆p,0 is the initial peak shift. The only free parameters used to ﬁt this equation
to measured data would be ∆p,0 and χc. The factor of two ambiguity in χc should be
easy to resolve. If the Thomas-Fermi density distribution is a poor approximation,
then the factor 4/35 should be diﬀerent. The quality of the ﬁt of the Thomas-
Fermi lineshape to the data in ﬁgures 5-5, 5-6, 5-9, and 5-10 indicates that this
approximation is reasonable.

To measure the condensate decay time cleanly, we require that the condensate is
not being replenished by the normal gas. The most straightforward way to accomplish
this is a complete removal of the normal gas by rf ejection. The trap depth would be
quickly swept down to the edge of the condensate, using high rf power to eﬃciently
outcouple all the normal atoms. DF or DS spectroscopy of the condensate would then
probe the time evolution of the peak shift, ∆p(t).

Since the lifetime of the condensate would be short, there would not be much
signal accumulation time. The detection eﬃciency in the current apparatus is too
low, but a factor of six improvement should make this experiment feasible (a factor of
six can be obtained by replacing the Lyman-α ﬁlter over the MCP with a window).
Currently, suﬃcient signal can be obtained by summing 0.8 s sweeps from several
identically prepared samples. A factor of six improvement would allow the sweeps to
be shortened to 0.13 s, short compared to the decay time 35χc/4g∆p,0 ≃
1 s expected
for χc = χm/2 and ∆p,0 ∼

600 kHz.

6.3.5 Exchange Eﬀects in Cold-Collision Frequency Shift

In section 5.6 we proposed that perhaps χc = χm, which would make sense if χm did
not include exchange eﬀects for some reason. This could be tested by measuring the
cold-collision frequency shift in the classical regime for atoms that are known to be
distinguishable. To ensure distinguishability, the atoms could be put into diﬀerent
hyperﬁne states, c and d. A c-state atom interacting with a d-state atom should
follow an interaction potential that is very similar to the identical particle case, but

110

the mean-ﬁeld interaction energy would be smaller by a factor of two because the
atoms are distinguishable and exchange eﬀects are absent. One expects two peaks
in the DF spectrum: one from collisions between identical particles, which is shifted
twice as much as the other, which is from collisions between distinguishable particles.
If the observed spectrum contains only a single peak, then we conclude that the atoms
are distinguishable in all collision processes. In that case we expect χc = χm.

1013 cm−

We propose to do this experiment in a very deep trap (ǫt/kB ≫

(µB/kB)506 G =
34 mK) so that the c-state atoms will be conﬁned (see ﬁgure 1-1). We propose to
use a sample typical of what exists immediately after loading the trap (T = 40 mK,
3). If half the atoms are transferred from the d to the c state, the
n0 = 2
expected decay time of the c-state atoms is τ
2 s. The dominant terms in the loss

ﬁelds around 600 G [104], which corresponds to the thermal energy. We must measure
the DF spectrum quickly compared to this time τ to observe how the spectrum
changes.

Time-of-ﬂight broadening would be signiﬁcant in this spectrum, on the 40 kHz
level for the current laser beam waist (100 µm diameter). This is large compared to the
expected cold-collision frequency shifts of 2 and 4 kHz. To reduce the broadening, the
beam diameter could be expanded by a factor of ten. The excitation rate (proportional
to the square of the radiation intensity) would drop by 104, but the interaction volume
would increase by 102 (the sample diameter is larger than the beam diameter). The
linewidth would narrow by a factor of ten because of the increased interaction time,
and so the overall signal rate would drop by only a factor of ten. Samples can
be created every two minutes and systematics are easy to control, so it would be
straightforward to accumulate signal.

6.3.6 Measuring a1S

The ground state s-wave scattering length has been calculated to the level of 10−
[40], but has not been measured nearly as well. One could use the interaction energy
U0np = 4π¯h2anp/m in the condensate to measure a, given the peak density np. We
propose to measure the chemical potential µ directly in an experiment similar to the
measurement of χc in section 6.3.4. Using µ = U0np we obtain a = µm/4π¯h2np. To
get µ we measure the diﬀerence between the potential energies at the center (θ) and
edge (εe) of the condensate. We measure θ by sweeping the rf frequency upward until
atoms begin to fall out of the trap, as described in section 4.2.4. We measure εe in
a series of measurements of the sample density; the normal atoms are removed by
sweeping the rf frequency down to some ending frequency fend, which is varied. For
fend slightly larger than εe/h the density measurements should give identical results.
But for fend < εe/h the condensate is depleted, and the measured density decreases.
A measurement of a to the 10% level seems feasible. Consider trap B and a peak
3. The bias ﬁeld θ must not drift more than
condensate density np = 3
1 mG between measurement of θ and εe; this stability should be possible. To measure
εe we vary fend and look for changes in the maximum frequency shift, as described
above. Since the maximum frequency shift scales linearly with the chemical potential,

1015 cm−

×

111

we must measure ∆p,0 to better than 10%. This should be possible with the factor of
six detection eﬃciency improvement outlined above. Many spectra would be obtained
as the condensate decays, and so a group of many data points would be ﬁt to the two
parameters in equation 6.3. Precision of 10% seems feasible.

6.3.7 Dynamics of 2S atoms in 1S condensate

As described in section 5.3.1 and in the thesis of Killian [13], condensate atoms ex-
cited to the 2S state are conﬁned radially by the deep interaction potential created
by the large condensate density. The motional eigenstates in the 2S potential are
rather diﬀerent from the 1S eigenfunction, the condensate wavefunction. We there-
fore expect the 2S atoms to exist in superpositions of several of these excited state
eigenfunctions, and to thus oscillate across the condensate.

The initial position of the 2S atoms is tuned by the detuning of the excitation ra-
diation ﬁeld. The position after some delay time τ could be measured using Balmer-α
absorption imaging. One expects breathing modes. Coherence eﬀects in the excita-
tion process could be explored with this technique.

6.4 Outlook

The studies of Bose condensed hydrogen presented here constitute simply the appe-
tizer in the feast of experiments to be carried out. Once ambiguities about χc are
straightened out and the fascinating asymmetric lines in section 5.5 are understood,
the creation of the high-ﬂux coherent atomic seems to be the next step. The beautiful
atom laser experiments of Mewes et al. [105], Kozuma et al. [96], and Anderson and
Kasevich [11] should provide solid stepping stones.

Appendix A

Theory of Trapped Classical Gas

In this appendix we present the statistical mechanical treatment of a trapped ideal
gas, consider decay of the sample through relaxation of the spin-polarization, and
calculate the eﬀects of evaporation. The appendix exists to familiarize the reader
with concepts and scaling laws useful for hydrogen trapping and cooling experiments.
Simple relations describe samples trapped in deep potentials. Here we address the
eﬀects of the ﬁnite trap depth, following the work of Luiten et al. [26]. We ﬁnd that
the truncation corrections are only important for shallow traps.

A.1 Ideal Gas

We begin our discussion by describing a trapped ideal gas in the classical regime.
“Trapped” implies conﬁnement by an inhomogeneous potential with a depth signiﬁ-
cantly greater than the characteristic energy of the gas particles. “Ideal” means that
collisions among the atoms, although crucial for maintaining thermal equilibrium, are
not included in the Hamiltonian. The interaction energy for the densities studied in
this thesis will turn out to be very small compared to the thermal energy, except in
the case of when a condensate, as described in section 2.2.2. “Classical” means that
the gas is far from quantum degeneracy, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
adequately describes the correct quantum distribution. These approximations are
appropriate for the trapped hydrogen gas studied in this thesis as it is cooled from
the initial temperature of about 40 mK to near the onset of quantum degeneracy
around 50 µK.

In sections A.1.1 and A.1.2 we describe the occupation function for the gas and the
density of states functions for traps of experimental interest. In section A.1.3 these
concepts are employed to calculate various thermodynamic properties.
In section
A.1.4 we consider trap losses arising from decay of the spin-polarization of the trapped
gas. Collisions and evaporative cooling are the topics of section A.2.

113

A.1.1 Occupation Function

We assume that the gas is well described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,
except that the energy distribution is truncated at some trap depth energy ǫt. The
gas is said to be quasi-thermal. This is a reasonable assumption if two conditions
hold [26]. First, the elastic collision rate must be high enough to redistribute particle
energies quickly compared to the rate at which processes occur which would take the
gas out of equilibrium, such as changes in the trap shape or depth. This is called
the “suﬃcient ergodicity” condition. (Elastic collisions are discussed in section A.2
below.) Second, particles with energies greater than the trap depth must be removed
promptly compared to the rate at which they are promoted to the energetic states.
Situations in which this condition is not satisﬁed have been discussed in section 2.1.

The phase space occupation function, f (ǫ), is the number of particles per unit

volume of phase space in a region of phase space with total energy ǫ =
H
is the Hamiltonian of the particle). We postulate an occupation function f (ǫ) that is
the Boltzmann factor [33] below the trap depth, and zero above:

ing this postulate was obtained by numerical integration of the Boltzmann transport
equation [26]. The occupation function of a simulated gas, described initially by
f (ǫ) =const. below threshold ǫt and zero above, was observed to transform to the
Boltzmann form in equation A.1 in a few characteristic collision times. The trapped
gas is described by two parameters, T and n0, which correspond to sample temper-
ature and maximum sample density in an inﬁnitely deep trap [26]. For ﬁnite trap
depths, temperature is poorly deﬁned because the distribution is truncated, and n0
is larger than the actual maximum sample density, as discussed in section 9.

A.1.2 Density of States

A useful concept is the density of states, the volume of parameter space corresponding
to the fulﬁllment of some condition. We use two density of states functions. The
“total energy density of states” function, ρ(ǫ), is the diﬀerential volume of phase
space corresponding to a total particle energy ǫ. (The number of particles N(ǫ)dǫ
within an energy dǫ of ǫ is the occupation per unit volume multiplied by the volume,
N(ǫ)dǫ = f (ǫ)ρ(ǫ)dǫ.) The “potential energy density of states” function, ̺(ε), is the
diﬀerential volume of real space with potential energy ε. In this thesis ε will always
denote a potential energy, and ǫ will always denote a total energy. Likewise, ̺(ε) will
always be a potential energy density of states, and ρ(ǫ) will always be a total energy
density of states.

The trap shapes, V (r), in our experiments are well approximated by either of
two model potentials. Both potentials are cylindrically symmetric, and we use z
for the axial coordinate and ρ for the radial coordinate. The aspect ratio of the
conﬁned clouds (length/diameter) is typically between 10 and 400. The “quadrupole
trap with hard wall ends” [106, 17] approximates traps used at higher temperatures
(T
1 mK), and was treated by Doyle [17]. The second model trap shape is often
called the “Ioﬀe-Pritchard” [31, 26] (labeled “IP”). It corresponds to the potential we
use at the lowest temperatures and has the form

A.1.4 Dipolar Decay

In this section we calculate the eﬀect of spin relaxation on the population and energy
of the trapped gas. Spin relaxation is the dominant loss process in our trap. In this
analysis we properly treat truncation of the energy distribution, following Luiten et
al. [26].

Dipolar spin relaxation is a process in which the magnetic dipoles of two atoms

118

interact, leading to a spin ﬂip of one or both atoms [57]. If one of the interacting
atoms makes a transition from the trapped d-state to the a state (see ﬁgure 1-1), the
hyperﬁne energy, corresponding to 68 mK, is released and both atoms are ejected
from the trap. An atom that makes a transition to the c-state is weakly trapped in
the radial direction, but is pulled by gravity out of the trap through the weak ﬁelds
along the trap axis. An atom that makes a transition to the high ﬁeld seeking b state
is expelled from the trap. The rate constant for loss from the trapped d state has
been calculated [104] and measured to the 20% level [107, 23]. The calculated rate
constant for loss from the d state through all channels at low temperatures is

φψ is the event rate for the process in which two atoms in the σ and

magnetic ﬁeld, but we ignore the dependence for the low temperature experiments
which are the focus of this thesis.

The dipolar decay rate from a region of density n is ˙n =

gn2. Consequently, loss
occurs most rapidly from regions of high density near the bottom of the trap. The
rate at which atoms are lost from the trap through dipolar decay is

The ratio V2/Vef f for the IP trap is plotted in ﬁgure A-3. The volume for dipolar
decay is smaller than the eﬀective volume because dipolar decay occurs preferentially
in regions of highest density, which are restricted to the bottom of the trap.

Since relaxation occurs predominantly near the bottom of the trap, the escaping
atoms typically have less energy than the sample average energy per particle, E.
Dipolar decay is thus a heating mechanism. The energy loss rate is the integral over
the trap of the local loss rate multiplied by the local average of the total energy per

So far we have not addressed elastic collisions, but they play a crucial role in the

collisions in maintaining thermal equilibrium and in evaporatively cooling the sample.
We calculate the equilibrium temperature of the gas. And we conclude the section
with a discussion of an impediment to eﬃcient evaporative cooling, the impediment
that prevented the creation of BEC in hydrogen before this work.

Only low energy collisions occur in our cold samples, so the elastic scattering
process is described by quantum mechanical s-wave scattering theory3 [108, 27]. The
result of this theory is that elastic interactions are parameterized by a single quantity,
the s-wave scattering length a. The cross section for collisions between identical
particles is σ = 8πa2. In a gas of density n and mean particle speed ¯v =
8kBT /πm,
the collision rate is Γcol(n) = nσ¯v√2. The collision rate determines the time scale for
energy redistribution in the gas.

q

A sample in a trap of ﬁnite depth is never in complete equilibrium since collisions
constantly tend to populate that portion of the equilibrium energy distribution which
lies above the trap depth. The removal of these energetic atoms is called evaporation.

3s-wave scattering is allowed for identical bosons, but is prohibited for identical fermions

Its use as a cooling mechanism for a trapped atomic gas was ﬁrst proposed by Hess
[106] and was ﬁrst demonstrated in the MIT spin-polarized hydrogen group [109].
Evaporation occurs when a collision of two atoms transfers enough energy to one
atom that it may escape the trap. This atom leaves the trap with an energy ǫ > ǫt,
much greater than the average energy per atom in the sample, E. The average
energy per remaining particle is lower, and after rethermalization of the trapped gas,
the temperature is lower. Cooling has occurred. Note that rethermalization is given
a headstart by the preferential evaporation of atoms from the upper end of the energy
distribution, closer in energy to the trap depth, ǫt, as described in appendix B.

A.2.1 Evaporative Cooling Rate

The evaporative cooling rate for a sample described by a truncated Boltzmann oc-
cupation function has been calculated by Luiten et al. [26] using the Boltzmann
transport equation. We quote their results here.

in curly braces in equation A.25 is nearly η + 1.

A.2.2 Equilibrium Temperature

The temperature of the trapped gas is set by a competition between heating due
to dipolar relaxation and cooling due to evaporation. The sample is in dynamic

If the temperature drops below equilibrium, the evaporation rate drops exponentially.
In addition, the eﬀective volume decreases, the density increases, and the heating rate
due to dipolar decay increases. On the other hand, if the temperature increases above
equilibrium, the heating rate decreases and the evaporative cooling rate increases. A
dynamic equilibrium is thus maintained.

The equilibrium temperature is found by numerically solving equation A.26. For
notational simplicity we deﬁne the factor B which indicates whether the IP trap is
primarily linear or harmonic in the radial direction,

The left and right hand sides are plotted in ﬁgure A-8 for typical trap depths and a
bias ﬁeld θ/kB = 34 µK. The equilibrium η is larger at higher temperatures because
the mean particle speed, and thus collision rate, is higher. The higher η at higher
temperatures indicates that evaporative cooling is more eﬃcient there; fewer atoms
are expended in the battle against heating caused by dipolar decay.

A.2.3 Forced Evaporative Cooling

The analysis above indicates that, for a given trap depth, a minimum temperature
will be achieved which is set by the competition between heating and cooling.
In
order to cool the sample further the trap depth must be reduced. A comprehensive
review by Ketterle and van Druten [56] of forced evaporation analyses the process

125

in detail. For the experiments described in this thesis the trap depth is reduced by
either lowering the magnetic conﬁnement ﬁeld at one end of the trap, or by reducing
the frequency of an RF magnetic ﬁeld that selectively removes the most energetic
atoms. This second method is the focus of chapter 3.

A computer model (described in appendix D) has been used to evolve in time the
total energy and total number of particles in the sample as it is cooled. Temperature
and density are calculated along the way. The eﬀects of changing the trap depth
and changing the functional form of the trapping potential have been included. This
model agrees well with experiments.

The rate at which the temperature of the gas can be changed is an important pa-
rameter. Luiten et al. [26] have shown that a classical gas with an energy distribution
far from equilibrium will reasonably approximate a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
after about three collision times. One therefore expects ﬂuctuations of the energy
distribution to dissipate on this time scale. To maintain quasi-equilibrium the trap
depth and the trapping potential should thus be changed slowly compared to this
collision time.

Since trapped atoms are a scarce commodity, a ﬁgure of merit for a cooling process
is the amount of phase space compression achieved per atom lost. Far from quantum
degeneracy the phase space density is the number of atoms per cubic thermal de
nΛ3. A useful measure of the cooling eﬃciency is the cooling
Broglie wavelength, D
exponent [56], which is the diﬀerential fractional change in phase space density per
diﬀerential fractional change in population,

≡

d log D
d log N

.

γ

≡

(A.29)

−

A large, negative value indicates that the phase space density increases by a large
factor for a decrease in population by only a small factor. Cooling exponents as large
as γ =

3 have been observed [110].

In cooling clouds of alkali metal atoms, a process called “runaway evaporation” is
observed, in which cooling of the sample leads to an increase in sample density because
the atoms are more localized in the bottom of the trap. In turn, the increased density
leads to an increased collision rate and faster evaporation. The cooling accelerates,
a desirable phenomena because the number of atoms lost through background gas
collisions during the time used to cool the sample is reduced when the cooling time
is shorter. The conditions required for runaway evaporation are carefully explained
by Ketterle et al. [56]. Runaway evaporation does not occur in clouds of trapped
hydrogen because the dominant loss rate, due to dipolar relaxation, increases with
increasing density with the same exponent as the evaporation rate. The ratio of the
evaporation loss rate (“good” losses) to the dipolar decay loss rate (“bad” losses),

Fraction of Collisions Which
Produce an Energetic Atom

In a collision between two atoms with a medium energy, what is the probability of
creating an “energetic atom”, i.e. an atom with enough energy to escape the trap?
Consider a collision between two distinguishable particles of identical mass m and
initial momenta p1 and p2. After the collision the momenta are labeled q1 and q2.
p2, and similarly
The total and relative momenta are P = (p1 + p2) and p = p1 −
for Q and q.

Conservation of momentum leads to the equation P = Q. We orient the axes of
the coordinate system so that Q = Qˆz and we work in spherical coordinates. The
total energy is

E0 = (P 2 + p2)/4m.
Conservation of energy demands that p2 = q2. We thus have four equations and six
unknowns, leaving two undetermined coordinates, which will be labeled θ and φ in
the description of

(B.1)

q = q

(ˆx cos φ + ˆy sin φ) sin θ + ˆz cos θ

{

}

After aligning the coordinate system we see that the there are two conserved scalar
quantites, P = Q and p = q. We can compute the fraction of this allowable phase
space corresponding to various conditions by assuming that, in a collision, θ and φ
may take any value with equal probability. We deﬁne the function f (θ, φ) dΩ as the
volume of phase space within a diﬀerential solid angle dΩ of the given angles. Since
the collisions are postulated to be independent of angle, we take f (θ, φ) = f0 = 1/4π.
In the calculations to follow we scale the energies to the trap depth, Et. We use
q/√4Etm and b = Q/√4Etm. The total energy is

This quantity may now be averaged over all the initial conditions of interest to

both particles are initially trapped but there is enough total energy for one particle
to escape. As we sum over all the possible initial states with the given a and b, we
must weight the average by the fraction of initial states which have both particles

Behavior of Non-Condensed
Fraction of a Degenerate Gas

In this appendix we consider a weakly interacting Bose gas of temperature T and
chemical potential µ
0 conﬁned in a trap of depth ǫt. A truncated Bose-Einstein
energy distribution is assumed. Here we derive results that will be used in section 2.3.
Truncation eﬀects are important because of the shallow traps used for the experiments
in chapter 5.

≤

As discussed in section 2.2.2, the interactions in the condensate increase the chem-
ical potential slightly above zero. The mean-ﬁeld repulsion energy of the condensate
deforms the eﬀective trap shape slightly, moving the energy at the bottom of the trap
from ε = 0 to ε = µ and ﬂattening the potential there. However, we ignore these
eﬀects on the thermal gas because for our experiments kBT
µ; the magnitude of
the deformation is much smaller than the characteristic energy of the atoms.

energies within a few kBT of the energy threshold ǫt, for which η′ is small. Also, for a
nearly degenerate gas (µ′ small) the population is concentrated more at low energies

the truncations eﬀects can be neglected.

which is unity for deep traps. For µ′ = 0 the middle term is 0.513. This result is
used in the calculation of the energy loss rate due to dipolar decay in section C.2.
This result tells us that the velocity distribution of a degenerate Bose gas should be
narrower than its classical counterpart, an eﬀect observed in section 5.3.2.

is a factor that indicates whether the trap is predominantly linear or harmonic in
the radial direction. This average energy is shown in ﬁgure C-4. For a classical gas
the average energy per quadratic degree of freedom is kBT /2, but for a degenerate
Bose gas the energy is less. For large φ the potential is harmonic and there are six
quadratic degrees of freedom, implying a mean energy of 3kBT for a classical gas; for a
degenerate Bose gas the mean energy is 2.7 kBT . The diﬀerence between the classical
0.5 mentioned for
and degenerate Bose results (3-2.7) is not as great as the factor
µ′ = 0 in the discussion of equation C.5. This is because in calculating the mean
kinetic energy an average is made over all the atoms in the trap with their many
eﬀective chemical potentials. Atoms far from the center of the gas have µ′
1,
and are essentially in the classical regime.

The behavior of Q2 is shown in ﬁgure C-6. The average energy carried away by each

relaxation is less than E, the average energy per particle throughout the sample
(compare ﬁgure C-7 with ﬁgure C-4), and thus dipolar relaxation leads to heating.
Compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the Bose-Einstein distribution
has more particles at lower energy. We thus expect C2 to be smaller, as is seen by

Appendix D

Model of the Dynamics of the
Non-Degenerate Gas

This appendix describes a computer model of the dynamics of the trapped gas, in-
cluding evaporation, dipolar decay, and changes of the trap shape and depth. The C
source code is available.

D.1 Overview

We desire a general purpose computer model of the time evolution of our trapped gas
to assist in choosing paths through parameter space toward BEC. Previous models
[17] employed approximations that are not valid at the low temperatures we wish to
access and are not easily adaptable to the more complicated trap shapes we wish to
employ.

D.1.1 Approximations

The primary approximation is that the phase space distribution function for the
gas is always a Maxwell-Boltzmann truncated at the trap depth. Luiten et al. [26]
have conﬁrmed this approximation for slow evaporation. This approximation is valid
as long as two additional assumptions are valid: (a) instantaneous ergodicity and
(b) instantaneous removal of energetic atoms. The validity of these approximations
depends on some time scales. For approximation (a) we need the time required for the
gas to re-equilibrate to be short compared to the speed at which the trap shape and
depth are changed. For approximation (b) we need the energetic atoms to be removed
quickly compared to the energy redistribution time. These are the approximations
described in section A.1.1.

D.1.2 Describing the Trap

We make no approximations about the trap shape. Instead the trap is described by
energy and potential energy density-of-states functions (ρ(ǫ) and ̺(ε)) which may

143

involve any number of parameters, all (possibly) time dependent. The energy trun-
cation point is also given as a time-dependent parameter.

D.2 Statistical Mechanical Description of the Gas

D.2.1 Variables

We describe the trap by an evaporation energy threshold, ǫt(t), and the density of
states functions and their set of (time dependent) parameters, ασ(t). These are our
independent variables. Some function is given by the user to relate these trap shape
parameters to time, the ultimate independent variable.

The primary dependent variables are E and N, the total energy and total pop-
ulation of the sample. At each time step during the evolution of the trapped gas
we calculate changes to the total energy, dE, and to the total number of atoms in
the trap, dN. The new value for T may then be calculated from E. If the form of
ρ(ǫ) is known, it is often possible to analytically relate T to E. Otherwise T must
be determined numerically, as is done in this model. The density parameter no is
trivially related to N by equation A.13.

D.2.2 Computing Properties of the Gas

The population, N, total energy, E, and density n(r) are computed as described in
section A.1.

The particle and energy loss rates ˙N2 and ˙E2 due to dipolar relaxation are given by
equations A.20 and A.22 in section A.1.4.

D.3.3 Trap Shape Changes

We assume that the trap shape is changing slowly compared to the transit time of an
atom across the trap. Trap shape changes are then adiabatic. We can use dS = 0 to

where the ﬁrst partial derivative is done at constant trap shape and the sum in the
second term is over all the trap shape parameters. Since the process is adiabatic,
dS = 0. From equation D.4 we see that if dS = 0 and N is ﬁxed we must have

= 0. Then we may ﬁnd dT by writing out d

D.4 Software Implementation

The evaporation simulator is a set of routines which numerically integrate the diﬀer-
ential equations for E and N through time. A user of these routines must write C
routines that describe the trap to the integration routines. The description takes the
form of an energy density of states, a potential energy density of states, and an energy
threshold above which the energy distribution is truncated. Other code (described

146

below) is also expected to parse the command line and do initialization. Ideally, all
of the information that specializes the general evaporation routines to a speciﬁc trap
and ramp function is contained in a single ﬁle in the directory specialized. This
ﬁle is mentioned in the top level Makeﬁle. Henceforth this ﬁle will be referred to as
userﬁle.

Information about the trap is passed to the evaporation simulation routines in a
data structure, mytrap, deﬁned in prog.h. The components of this data structure
are pointers to functions and arrays. The data structure is a global variable, and is
initialized by the routine initialize_mytrap in userﬁle. This routine is called at
the very beginning of the program.

D.4.1 Program Flow

Execution of the program ﬂows as follows. First, initialize_mytrap() is called to
set up the data structure. Then a routine, pointed to by mytrap, is invoked to parse
the command line and stash user-provided information into the appropriate arrays.
The diﬀerential equation integrator is then started. It steps E and N through time
using the Runge-Kutta routines from Numerical Recipes [111]. At each time step the
routines from userﬁle are used as follows. First, the threshold and parameters used
for calculating the density of states are calculated. These might correspond to magnet
currents or rf ﬁeld frequencies, as computed for controlling the experiment. These
values are printed to a log ﬁle. Since these parameters may often be manipulated into
a form that economizes computation when calculating the density of states, another
routine, pointed to by mytrap, is invoked to do this. Finally, we are ready to calculate
ψn and ϕn for this instant. The new temperature and density are calculated. The
eﬀects of evaporation, relaxation, skimming, and adiabatic trap shape changes are
determined, and we are ready for the next step.

D.4.2 Data Structure

The data structure mytrap is referenced often is these calculations, and is the link
between user-supplied routines and the general simulation machinery. The entries in
the data structure are:

parse Pointer to a function which parses the command line, obtaining the
initial density and temperature of the simulated gas, and the duration of the
simulation. This information is returned to the simulator. Further information
might be the beginning and ending currents in certain magnets, shape factors
for ramps, etc., which would be used to specify the trap shape at each instant
of time.

threshold Pointer to a function that gives the energy threshold (atoms with
more than this energy are assumed to escape from the trap), as a function of
time.

147

calc_dos_params Pointer to a function which calculates, at a given time, the
parameters used to calculate the density of states. The values calculated here
will be printed in the log ﬁle for each time step.

n_dos_params An integer, giving the number of density of states parameters
calculated by calc_dos_params. These are printed in the log ﬁle.

precalculate Pointer to a function which manipulates the density of states
parameters to speed up actual calculation of the density of states. For example,
in a Ioﬀe trap the density of states is proportional to the square root of the radial
conﬁnement ﬁeld. This square root may be calculated here in this routine.

edos A pointer to a routine which returns the energy density of states at a
given energy.

pedos A pointer to a routine which returns the potential energy density of states
at a given energy.

trapspecs An array of information used (possibly) by calc_dos_params and
threshold. These data are not touched by the simulator. The only C ﬁle that
looks at these is userﬁle.

ntrapspecs Size of the array trapspecs. Only used in ﬁle userﬁle.

Several examples of userﬁle exist, and may be copied and hacked.

Bose-Einstein Velocity Distribution
Function

To ﬁnd the one-dimensional velocity distribution function which is used in calculating
the Doppler-sensitive lineshape observed in section 5.3.2 one should use the Bose-
Einstein (BE) occupation function instead of the more convenient Maxwell-Boltzmann
(MB) occupation function. For a gas at temperature T and chemical potential µ the
occupation function is

f (ǫ; T, µ) =

1
µ)/kB T

e(ǫ
In this appendix we derive the BE one-dimensional velocity distribution function and
use it to calculate characteristic spectral lineshapes. Truncation eﬀects for a trap
of depth ǫt are included, but shown to be small when the laser beam intersects the
middle of the trap and preferentially excites atoms from the deepest part of the trap.
In this case, quantum degeneracy is shown to narrow the spectrum.

The behavior of Υ0 is shown in ﬁgure E-1. For large η′ truncation is unimportant
and Υ0 = 1.

The velocity distribution function is fv(vz) = mfp(mvz). Figure E-2 shows this
distribution function for various potential energies in the trap. At higher potentials
the eﬀective chemical potential becomes more negative, and the distributions look
more classical. Only very near the trap minimum is there signiﬁcant clumping of the
velocities around zero.

Figure E-3 directly compares the quantum velocity distribution (small µ) with
the classical distribution (large µ). As expected, the classical velocity distribution
at ε = 0.1kBT and ε = 1kBT are nearly identical, but diﬀer substantially from
their quantum counterparts. For ε = 5kBT the classical and quantum distributions
are nearly identical because even the degenerate gas becomes dilute at this high
potential energy. Truncation eﬀects are important, as evidenced by the sharp cutoﬀ
of the velocity distribution.

Model of the Dynamics of the
Degenerate Gas

F.1 Overview

This appendix describes a computer model of the dynamics of the degenerate trapped
gas, including evaporation and dipolar decay losses from the condensate and thermal
gas. As depicted in ﬁgure 2-2, the trapped gas is modeled as a system composed of
two tightly coupled components, the thermal gas and the condensate. We assume
the loss rates from the system are slow compared to the rates of transferring particles
and energy between the two components. A dynamical equilibrium is thus postulated.
The results of this model are shown in ﬁgure 5-11.

The trap shape is assumed to be static and of the Ioﬀe-Pritchard form. The depth
is ﬁxed. The Bose-Einstein occupation function is used for calculation of dipolar decay
losses from the thermal gas, and the Thomas-Fermi condensate wavefunction is the
basis for calculations of loss from the condensate.

The particle and energy loss rates due to evaporation should be calculated using
a quantum kinetic theory derived from the quantum Boltzmann transport equation.
This approach would correctly include the Bose statistics. As a very simple approxi-
mation to the desired, but complicated, formulation, we simply apply the evaporation
rates calculated for a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by Luiten et al. [26] (equations
in section A.2.1). One expects a lower evaporation rate near quantum degeneracy be-
cause atom energies are distributed to lower energies relative to the thermal energy
kBT than is typical in a classical gas. Roughly speaking, the eﬀective η is larger.
Another way to think about the situation is to realize that collisions which lead to
evaporation occur preferentially among higher energy atoms. As shown in ﬁgure 2-1,
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution calls for many more atoms in these regions of
higher energy than does the Bose-Einstein distribution in the degenerate regime. We
therefore reduce the evaporation rate by the adjustable factor

F.2 Simulation Details

The input to the simulation is the initial temperature of the thermal gas and the
initial condensate population (the proper thermodynamic parameters are T and µ; the
chemical potential is directly linked to the peak condensate density, which is directly
connected to the condensate population). The trap shape and depth (α, β, θ, ǫt) are
additional parameters. Finally, a one body loss rate with time constant τ1 is speciﬁed.
Using this input, the program calculates the total occupation of the trap, NT , and
the total energy, ET , using equations C.6, C.9, and 2.14, and the condensate energy
Ec = µNc = npU0Nc. It is the total energy and the total population that is evolved
in time. At each time step the temperature is found by numerically solving equation
C.9 for the total energy of the thermal gas. We assume µ = 0 for the thermal gas
If we allowed µ to vary, then two equations would
during the entire simulation.
have to be consistently solved numerically, one for Nt and one for Et (possible, but
more diﬃcult). Once the temperature is found, the occupation of the thermal gas
is calculated. The condensate occupation is the total trap occupation minus the
Nt (we postulate equilibrium between the thermal
thermal occupation, Nc = NT −
gas and the condensate, a questionable assumption as discussed in section 2.3.3).
The particle and energy loss rates due to dipolar relaxation from the thermal gas and
condensate are calculated using equations C.13 and C.15. Possible one-body losses
are added. The particle and energy loss rates due to evaporation from the thermal
gas are calculated for a classical gas of the same peak density as the Bose gas being
simulated, no = 2.612/Λ3(T ). These rates are multiplied by the correction factor
.
F
The sum of all the particle and energy loss rates for the given time step is returned
to the diﬀerential equation stepper routine.

The simulation is stepped through time using the Romberg integration technique

[111]. Errors in NT and ET are maintained below the 10−

5 level.

F.3 Improvements

One important improvement would be to determine the evaporation rate using the
quantum Boltzmann equation, which is based on the correct quantum occupation
function. This has been done very recently [112].

Further improvements would include treatment of the ﬁnite feeding rate of the
condensate from the thermal gas. This bottleneck should be playing a role for the
largest condensates in this thesis, as suggested in section 2.3.3.

Appendix G

Trap Shape Uncertainties

In order to calculate various properties of the thermal gas and condensate, it is nec-
essary to combine measurements (of density and temperature, for example) with
knowledge of the trap shape. In principle the trap shape can be calculated simply
from the Biot-Savart law. In practice various complications arise. In this appendix
we discuss these complications and estimate their eﬀect on the trap shape. We con-
clude that the trap parameters (radial gradient α and axial curvature β) should have
uncertainties of less than 20%.

The trap shapes used for the experiments in this thesis are created by currents
in 17 superconducting coils. Various compensation schemes are employed to produce
steep gradients and large curvatures along the z axis, and shim coils are used to adjust
the bias ﬁeld. One source of uncertainty is knowledge of the precise geometry of the
coils. Additional uncertainties exist because ﬁelds of unknown strength and direction
arise from trapped ﬂuxes [17] and magnetized materials in the cryostat.

We ﬁrst address the stray ﬁelds: how can these stray ﬁelds inﬂuence the trap
shape? Let us consider the inﬂuence of stray ﬁelds on the three Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap
parameters, α, β, and θ. We label the three space coordinates x, y, z, and assume the
trap exhibits cylindrical symmetry about the z axis. A uniform ﬁeld perpendicular to
the z axis will shift the location of the trap minimum in the plane, but will not aﬀect
α, β, or θ. A uniform ﬁeld parallel to the z axis will shift θ, but not aﬀect α or β. A
gradient ﬁeld with strength B = s x (s is the gradient strength) aligned perpendicular
to the z axis will add linearly with α, but will not aﬀect β or θ. A ﬁeld with strength
B = s z aligned parallel to the z axis will move the trap minimum along the axis and
shift θ, but will not aﬀect β. A ﬁeld with strength B = s z aligned perpendicular to
the z axis will tip the trap symmetry axis away from the z axis, but not aﬀect any
parameters directly. Finally, a ﬁeld parallel to the z axis and with strength B = s x
will bow the trap and directly perturb all three parameters. Deﬁning the unitless
parameter ǫ =

1 + (µBs/α)2, we ﬁnd that α

β/ǫ, and θ

ǫα, β

θ/ǫ.

q

In the traps of immediate interest in this thesis, the samples are short (a few cm)
and very narrow (less than 1 mm in diameter). The radial gradient ﬁelds are large
102 G/cm), and sources of stray ﬁelds are far (several cm) from the sample. Thus,
(
∼
we expect only very weak perturbations to the gradient parameter α and the curvature
β. The parameter θ is easily perturbed, but we can measure it directly, as described in

section 4.2.4. Trapped ﬂuxes are expected to exist on the 1 G level, but the distance
from the sources (superconducting wires) to the trap should cause these ﬁelds to
appear as simple gradients, which have been shown above to only slightly perturb β
and α. Magnetic materials in the cryostat could produce large ﬁelds (
100 G),
but they are very far away and the ﬁeld should therefore appear uniform across the
trap (i.e. not appear as gradients). We conclude that stray ﬁelds should not perturb
the trap parameters α and β signiﬁcantly. The parameter θ may be perturbed, but
it can be measured directly.

10

−

∼

Measurements of θ can be complicated by the eﬀects of gravity:

for very cold
samples gravity can pull the atom cloud away from the region of lowest magnetic ﬁeld,
thus making the measurement of θ ambiguous. This distortion becomes important
when the gravitational potential energy varies over the height, h, of the cloud by
many times the thermal energy: h
kBT /mg = (0.84 mm/µK)T . For the present
samples we are far from this limit.

≫

Since stray ﬁelds do not strongly eﬀect α or β, the primary uncertainty in knowl-
edge of the trap shape arises from uncertainty of the coil winding geometry. The ﬁeld
cancelation scheme used to create tight curvature β along the z axis ampliﬁes the
uncertainties since the net ﬁeld is the small diﬀerence between multiple large ﬁelds.
Reasonable uncertainties in the winding geometry (elongations and translations of
coils on the scale of 5 mm) give rise to no more than 10% changes to the calculated
β.

A calculation of one of the trap shapes used in chapter 5 is shown in ﬁgure G-1,
along with analytic ﬁts to the bottom of the potential. The harmonic approximation
of the axial curvature of the trap should be precise to the 10% level.

We conclude that uncertainties in the trap shape due to both stray ﬁelds and

imprecise winding geometry should be below the 20% level.

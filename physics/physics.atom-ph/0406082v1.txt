Abstrat. We investigate theoretially the appliation of tailored inoherent far-

infrared (cid:28)elds in rotational ooling of translationally old polar moleules. The ooling

shemes are based on a far-infrared light (cid:28)eld induing seleted rotational transitions

in ombination with laser exitation of a single rovibrational transition. The ooling

shemes are e(cid:27)etive on a timesale shorter than the typial unperturbed trapping time

in ion traps and omparable to the trapping times that an be obtained for neutral

moleules.

Rotational ooling of moleules using lamps

In reent years, the physis of old moleules has beome a very ative researh

area (Doyle and Friedrih, 1999; Williams and Julienne, 2000; Weinstein et al., 1998;

Egorov et al., 2002; Bethlem et al., 2002; Mølhave and Drewsen, 2000; Johim et al.,

2003; Zwierlein et al., 2003; Greiner et al., 2003).

It is expeted that the ability

to ool and trap moleules will provide new experimental data of relevane for

studies of ultra-old dilute gases (Santos et al., 2000) and open new areas of researh

suh as quantum ontrolled hemistry and moleular quantum logis (Demille, 2002;

Tesh and de Vivie-Riedle, 2002). Unfortunately, the omplex struture of internal

moleular levels impedes the formation of losed optial pumping yles neessary

for applying the laser ooling shemes developed for atoms. Hene, alternative

routes for obtaining old moleules have been sought, but so-far only a few methods

have been su(cid:30)iently simple to have allowed for experimental demonstration. These

shemes inlude prodution of old moleules from an ultraold loud of atoms

using a tunable Feshbah resonane (Zwierlein et al., 2003; Johim et al., 2003;

Regal et al., 2003; Greiner et al., 2003; Cubizolles et al., 2003) or photoassoiation

(Vanhaeke et al., 2002; Kerman et al., 2004),

ooling by ollision with a low

temperature bu(cid:27)er gas (Weinstein et al., 1998; Egorov et al., 2002), deeleration and

trapping of polar moleules by eletri (cid:28)elds (Bethlem et al., 2002; Bethlem and Meijer,

2003; van de Meerakker et al., 2003), and sympathetial translational ooling of ioni

moleules (Mølhave and Drewsen, 2000; van Eijkelenborg et al., 1999).

If old polar moleules in a room temperature environment is the goal, oupling of

the moleules to the blakbody radiation (BBR) will, on a timesale of tens of seonds,

distribute population over several rotational levels while possibly leaving the moleules

in their vibrational ground state (Heht(cid:28)sher et al., 1998; Amitay et al., 1998). When

long trapping times and long intervals between ollisions are available, it is, however,

possible to use BBR onstrutively in ombination with laser-indued rovibrational

transitions to assist rotational ooling (Vogelius et al., 2002).

Here we disuss the surprising possibility to rotationally ool polar moleules, whih

are already translationally old, by applying the inoherent far-infrared radiation (cid:28)eld

from a lamp to drive seleted rotational transitions in ombination with just a single

laser-exited rovibrational transition. As we shall disuss below, suh ooling shemes

are, from an experimental point of view, signi(cid:28)antly simpler than previous shemes

(Vogelius et al., 2002) whih required two laser-indued transitions. Based on the

onstraints set by the spetral density pro(cid:28)le of a realisti merury lamp (Kimmit et al.,

1996), the inoherent (cid:28)eld is tailored for optimum ooling into the rovibrational ground

state. The timesale for the ooling is found to be shorter than the typial unperturbed

trapping time in an ion trap (Mølhave and Drewsen, 2000) and omparable to realisti

trapping times for neutral moleules (van de Meerakker et al., 2001).

The laser exitations and subsequent spontaneous emission paths for the onsidered

shemes are presented in (cid:28)gure 1 with laser-indued transitions being either (a) Raman

transitions via an exited eletroni state or (b) diret transitions between rovibrational

levels. With (ν, N) denoting the vibrational ν and rotational N quantum numbers, the

e(cid:27)et of the laser-indued transitions is to pump the moleule into the (0, 0) ground state.
This is realized by a pumping yle omposed of (i) exitation from the (0, 2) state to an

exited vibrational level and (ii) subsequent dipole allowed radiative deays. Assuming

an initially broad rotational distribution in thermal equilibrium with the environment at

300 K, the repeated depletion of the (0, 2) state will then result in a transfer of population

towards the rotational ground state by BBR-indued rotational transitions. Due to the

nature of the BBR no ontrol of the strength of individual rotational transitions is

possible. This an, however, be obtained by introduing an additional inoherent far-

infrared radiation (cid:28)eld derived from, e.g., a high-pressure merury lamp, and by applying

frequeny (cid:28)lters. In this way, it is possible to tailor the radiation intensity around the

individual rotational transitions. One an for instane use a dihroi (cid:28)lter as a high-

pass (cid:28)lter (Winnewisser et al., 1999) suh that the rate of the (0, 1) ↔ (0, 2) ooling
transition will be enhaned without e(cid:27)eting the rate of the (0, 0) ↔ (0, 1) heating

transition.

Though the ooling shemes should work for a large variety of

ions and

neutrals, we now fous on implementations in the partiular ase of MgH+

whih

has been translationally ooled experimentally (Mølhave and Drewsen , 2000). We

showed previously that the laser intensities needed to saturate the Raman transition

depited in (cid:28)gure 1(a) in MgH+

are readily obtained by standard pulsed laser

systems (Vogelius et al., 2002). For the diret sheme ((cid:28)gure 1(b)), the infrared

(cid:28)eld ould be obtained either by di(cid:27)erene-frequeny generation or by applying an

optial parametri osillator based on the beam of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Shi et al.,

Rotational ooling of moleules using lamps

2002; Vodopyanov et al., 1999). At the wavelength ≃ 5.9 µm needed to drive the
(0, 2) ↔ (1, 1) transition in MgH+
nonlinear rystals an typially deliver an energy of ∼ 10 µJ per 10 ns pulse. Given
the Einstein A-oe(cid:30)ient of ≃ 20 s

−1

for the relevant transition (Vogelius et al., 2002),

(Huber and Herzberg, 1979), infrared-light generating

and assuming a maximum detuning of 1 GHz due to (cid:29)utuations in the frequeny of

the laser light, saturation of the transition during a 10 ns pulse requires an averaged

Turning to the lamp, the presene of suh an inoherent far-infrared soure may

improve the ooling rate by speeding up the feeding of the (0, 2) pump state from

higher-lying states. The transfer of population away from the pump state is, however,

inevitable and it may thus be expeted that a ertain spetral density distribution of

the inoherent radiation will be optimal for the ooling shemes. In the following we

investigate this hypothesis under realisti experimental onstraints given by available

inoherent soures and possible (cid:28)ltering and fousing systems. To estimate the energy

density at the moleular target, we note that the output of a standard merury lamp at

a wavelength of ∼ 500µm orresponding to low-lying rotational transitions in MgH+

is

similar to a BBR soure at a temperature of 4000 K (Kimmit et al., 1996). We assume

unit magni(cid:28)ation of the light soure and 2π solid angle pikup of radiation. This is

reasonable sine a setup with a re(cid:29)etor and with large aperture molded lenses, whih

are available in this wavelength regime, would ideally give ∼ 4π pikup. Allowing
for some additional losses from absorption and sattering we use ρlamp = 5ρ300K as

the maximum ahievable spetral energy density from the lamp at the moleular ions

(Niolaisen, 2003).

We model the ooling dynamis by rate equations inluding transitions indued

by the inoherent radiation as well as by the laser(s). The moleular parameters are

obtained by alulating Born-Oppenheimer potential energy urves and dipole moment

funtions using standard quantum hemistry odes (Frish et al., 1995) followed by the

alulation of radial wavefuntions using the Numerov method (LeRoy, 2002), from

whih the Einstein oe(cid:30)ients entering the rate equations are found. All simulations

are made with an initial 300 K Boltzmann distribution over moleular energy levels and

a pulsed laser system with a repetition rate of 100 Hz and assuming saturation of the

driven transition during eah pulse.

We maximize the (cid:28)nal population in the ground state as funtion of the inoherent

radiation density at the individual rotational transition frequenies for spei(cid:28) ooling

times by the downhill simplex method (Lagarias et al., 1998).

It is found that the

density distribution should be the maximum attainable for the (0, 1) ↔ (0, 2), (0, 2) ↔
(0, 3), and (0, 3) ↔ (0, 4) transitions, but zero otherwise. This rather simple shape

may be understood by (cid:28)rst noting that for a moleule sub jet to BBR, stimulated

proesses will dominate at low frequenies while spontaneous emission will do so at high

frequenies. As a result the highest populated state is to be found where spontaneous

and stimulated transition rates are balaned (see the un(cid:28)lled olumns in (cid:28)gure 4). The

BBR density is low and transition rates are small for rotational states lying below

the state whih is maximally populated in thermal equilibrium (300 K). However,

introduing additional inoherent radiation to drive transitions between these low-lying

states will aelerate the proess of re(cid:28)lling the (0, 2) pump state, and thereby inrease

the ooling rate. Radiation whih ouples states above the peak in the 300 K BBR

population distribution, would heat the distribution as would any radiation in addition

to BBR at the (0, 0) ↔ (0, 1) transition frequeny.

Figure 2 shows simulations of the ground state population as a funtion of time

for various inoherent (cid:28)elds. The solid urves are the results with the optimized

(cid:28)eld. While it is ritial to keep the (0, 0) ↔ (0, 1) transition rate low (whih an be

ahieved by introduing a sharp high-pass (cid:28)lter (Winnewisser et al., 1999)), simulations

show that the results are less sensitive to the atual shape of the frequeny ut-o(cid:27)

at the higher rotational transitions.

In (cid:28)gure 2 this latter point is illustrated by

omparing the results for the optimal soure with the results for an inoherent (cid:28)eld

distribution orresponding to maximum attainable intensities at all transitions from

(0, 1) ↔ (0, 2) to (0, 7) ↔ (0, 8), roughly equivalent to introduing a piee of quartz in

the beam path. We have also inluded alulations without the inoherent soure to

show that the e(cid:27)etiveness of the ooling sheme depends ritially on the rotational

transitions indued by the lamp. Finally for omparison, the results of the Raman

sheme simulation of Vogelius et al. (2002), where the (0, 1) state is depleted by a seond

Raman transition, is shown.

For very short ooling times (< 1 s) essentially no di(cid:27)erenes between the shemes

an be observed sine the relatively slow rotational transitions are not yet important.

On intermediate timesales (∼ 10 s), however, the e(cid:27)et of the added inoherent (cid:28)eld is

after 60 s of ooling vs. relative intensity

of inoherent radiation from a lamp. The shemes are: Diret sheme with optimal

(dashed-dotted), See text for details. Note sale of the ordinate.

evident and the optimized sheme has an advantage over the sheme of Vogelius et al.

(2002). Finally, at longer times the laser-depletion of the (0, 1) state as well as

the additional heat introdued by the inoherent soure, make the ooling sheme of

Vogelius et al. (2002) slightly more e(cid:30)ient.

For a (cid:28)xed ooling time of 60 s, (cid:28)gure 3 shows the dependene of the ooling

e(cid:30)ieny on the intensity Irel of the inoherent soure relative to BBR at 300 K in the

frequeny range of interest. The in(cid:29)uene of the inoherent (cid:28)eld on the ooling proess

is seen to inrease signi(cid:28)antly up to Irel ≈ 5, from where only minor improvements

may be obtained.

In (cid:28)gure 4, the population distribution after 60 s of ooling for the ase of Irel = 5

is ompared with the initial Boltzmann distribution for the four shemes onsidered

in (cid:28)gure 3. With the optimized spetral distribution we obtain 68 % and 74 % in

the ground state with the Raman and diret sheme, respetively, orresponding to a

temperature of ∼ 7 K, whih is of astrophysial relevane (Snow, 1992; Snyder, 1992).
In both shemes the depletion of the rotational levels above the N = 2 pump state is

evident. Compared to the optimized ase, one observes slightly larger populations in

the rotational states above N = 5 for the (cid:16)quartz-(cid:28)ltered(cid:17) soure due to the heating

e(cid:27)et of the high frequeny omponents in this distribution.

Above we only onsidered time-independent inoherent soures but sine the ooling

time is 10 − 100 s, it would be easy experimentally to hange the shape of the inoherent

(cid:28)eld during ooling and hene look for improvements of the shemes by optimizing a

estimated the maximal attainable ooling e(cid:30)ieny using an arbitrary time-dependent

obtained whih orresponds to an inrease by 7 % and 5 %, respetively, ompared

to the result with the optimum stati spetral distribution. Furthermore, in order to

gain information on a possible optimized time-dependent (cid:28)eld, we did a alulation

where the (cid:28)eld was optimized after 5, 10, 15, . . . , 60 s. At eah instant of time we

then ompared the population in the ground state with that from the time-independent

We have tested the shemes on ioni moleules with other rovibrational transition

and

therefore be appliable to almost any diatomi moleule if the rotational and vibrational

transition rates are omparable to those of MgH+

or faster.

In onlusion, we have demonstrated the surprising result that polar moleules

trapped in a room temperature environment an be rotationally ooled by the

ombination of a lamp induing rotational transitions and a laser driving a single

rovibrational transition. Under experimental realisti onstraints we have shown that

there exists a spei(cid:28) tailored inoherent frequeny distribution whih optimizes the

ooling proess when onsidering time-independent (cid:28)elds. We have,

furthermore,

estimated that an optimized time-dependent inoherent (cid:28)eld will only lead to a minor

inrease in the ground state population. From an experimental view-point, the

onsidered shemes are very simple, and hene very attrative for sympathetially ooled

target moleular ions, and potentially also for trapped neutral moleules and moleular

ions in storage rings.

Synchronous Optical Pumping of Quantum Revival Beats for Atomic Magnetometery

S. J. Seltzer, P. J. Meares, and M. V. Romalis
Department of Physics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544

We observe quantum beats with periodic revivals due to non-linear spacing of Zeeman levels in
the ground state of potassium atoms and demonstrate their synchronous optical pumping by double
modulation of the pumping light at the Larmor frequency and the revival frequency. We show that
synchronous pumping increases the degree of spin polarization by a factor of 4. As a practical
example, we explore the application of this double-modulation technique to atomic magnetometers
operating in the geomagnetic ﬁeld range and ﬁnd that it can increase the sensitivity and reduce
magnetic ﬁeld orientation-dependent measurement errors endemic to alkali-metal magnetometers.

Periodic revival of quantum beats is a general phe-
nomenon that occurs in multi-level systems with non-
linear energy level spacing [1, 2] and has been observed
in diverse systems, from one-atom masers [3] and Ryd-
berg states in atoms [4] to molecular vibrational [5] and
rotational [6] states. Recently molecular rotational re-
vivals attracted signiﬁcant attention because of the pos-
sibility of using them for alignment of molecules with
ultrashort laser pulses [7, 8, 9, 10]. It has been proposed
that periodic laser pulses could be used to increase the de-
gree of molecular alignment and maintain it indeﬁnitely
[11, 12, 13, 14]. An increase of molecular alignment using
two pulses has been demonstrated in [15].

Here we show experimentally that appropriately syn-
chronized train of laser pulses can increase in the de-
gree of spin orientation and maintain it indeﬁnitely by
synchronously pumping quantum revivals in the ground-
state Zeeman levels of an alkali-metal atom. Periodic
revivals of quantum beats in Zeeman levels of alkali-
metal atoms occur naturally due to non-linear Breit-Rabi
mixing [16] and have been modeled in [17]. We observe
quantum revivals in K atoms and demonstrate their syn-
chronous pumping by double modulation of the pump
laser at both the Larmor and the revival frequencies. We
ﬁnd that it creates a coherently oscillating superposition
state with a spin polarization a factor of 4 higher than
can be obtained without double modulation for the same
average laser power. We also model the eﬀects in other
alkali atoms and ﬁnd that the amount of polarization en-
hancement increases for systems with a larger number of
quantum states.

Because the revivals occur in geomagnetic ﬁeld range
of about 0.5 G, our experiments are also directly appli-
cable to optically-pumped alkali-metal magnetometers,
which are used in many applications, from archaeology
[18] and mineral exploration [19] to searches for a CP-
violating electric dipole moment [20]. As was recently
discussed in [21, 22], Breit-Rabi mixing of Zeeman lev-
els decreases magnetometer sensitivity by splitting the
Zeeman resonance into many separate lines. We show
that synchronous pumping of quantum revivals largely
recovers the signal loss.
In addition, we demonstrate
that it generates a symmetric resonance lineshape, re-

ducing a systematic eﬀect endemic to most alkali-metal
magnetometers, known as a heading error, that causes
changes in the measured absolute value of the magnetic
ﬁeld depending on the orientation of the magnetometer
with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld vector [23]. We expect
that synchronous pumping of revivals can be also used
to improve the precision and accuracy of spectroscopic
measurements on other multi-level systems.

For alkali-metal atoms with nuclear spin I, the energy
levels of the two hyperﬁne states with F = I ± 1/2 in
a magnetic ﬁeld B are given by well-known Breit-Rabi
equation [16]. Following the general description of quan-
tum revivals in multi-level systems [2], the energy levels
can be expanded in powers of mF keeping only the lead-
ing B dependence in each term,

where µeﬀ = (gsµB + gI µN )/(2I + 1), hνhf
is the hy-

ment, gs ≃ 2 is the electronic g-factor, µN is the nu-
clear magneton, and µB is the Bohr magneton. The

sion νL = (−gIµN ± µeﬀ) B/h, the revival frequency

(I = 3/2, gI = 0.26, νhf = 461.7 MHz) in a magnetic ﬁeld
B = 0.5 G we have νL = 350 kHz, νrev = 265 Hz and
νsuprev = 0.4 Hz.

The experiments are performed in a 5 cm diameter
evacuated spherical Pyrex cell with a 1 mm diameter, 5
cm long stem containing K metal in natural abundance
(93% 39K and 7% 41K). The cell is heated to 60◦C by
hot air in a double-walled glass oven. The cell walls
are coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to reduce
surface spin relaxation of K atoms. OTS molecules (CH3-
(CH2)17-Si-Cl3) attach to glass through a silanization re-
action and ideally expose alkali atoms only to a surface
of long hydrocarbon chains, known to reduce wall relax-
ation due to their low polarizability [24]. We have used

FIG. 1: Measurement of hSxi showing multiple quantum re-
vivals. Synchronous pumping of quantum revivals is started
150 msec before t = 0 and stopped at t = 60 msec, allowing
free decay of spin coherence. Inset a) shows a comparison of
the revival envelope with a density matrix simulation (dashed
lines), while inset b) shows double-modulation of the pump
laser frequency so the optical pumping only occurs during
instances of maximum expectation value of hSzi.

the coating procedure described in [25] and obtained K
longitudinal spin relaxation time T1 up to 145 msec, cor-
responding to 2100 collisions with the walls before depo-
larization, although the relaxation times were not entirely
consistent and other cells coated in the same batch had
T1 of 1.6 ms, 20 ms, and 61 ms. The longitudinal spin
relaxation time did not degrade and actually improved in
some cells when they were heated to 120◦C for a period
of weeks. In magnetic resonance measurements we found
that T2 was limited by relaxation due to magnetic ﬁeld
gradients to about 30 msec.

In most measurements we use the Bell-Bloom tech-
nique [26] of spin resonance excitation using a pump laser
modulated at the Larmor frequency. The cell is placed in
three orthogonal Helmholtz coils which are used to con-
trol the magnitude and direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, as
well as ﬁve gradient coils used to cancel ambient ﬁeld gra-
dients. The ﬁeld is nominally set along the ˆy direction,
and magnetic ﬁeld noise along this direction is actively
canceled using feedback from a ﬂuxgate sensor (Barting-
ton Instruments Mag-03MC) located next to the oven.
The atoms are pumped by circularly-polarized light from
a DFB diode laser propagating along the ˆz direction.
The laser is detuned by approximately 6.3 GHz oﬀ the
potassium D1 resonance at 770.1 nm, much larger than
the measured 0.9 GHz Doppler-broadened halfwidth of
the optical line. The laser current is sinusoidally mod-
ulated at the Larmor frequency so that the laser fre-
quency reaches the resonance only for a short fraction
of each cycle. For synchronous pumping of quantum re-
vivals a secondary modulation is applied at twice the
revival frequency, turning the Larmor frequency current

modulation on and oﬀ with a duty cycle in the range
of 1-10%, as shown in Fig. 1b. In addition, the relative
phase of the Larmor modulation is changed by 180◦ for
odd modulation pulses. In frequency space this creates
sidebands of the optical pumping rate that are located
at νL ± νrev(2n + 1), n = 0, 1, 2... When the high fre-
quency modulation is tuned exactly to νL for F = 2,
the sidebands of the pumping rate modulation simulta-
neously excite all F = 2 Zeeman transitions. Simulta-
neous excitation of two Zeeman coherences in an atomic
magnetometers has been previously demonstrated in [27].
The pump beam power is always adjusted to broaden
magnetic resonance width by a factor of 2, which gives
the same average pumping rate that approximately max-
imizes the signal-to-noise ratio in atomic magnetometers.
The hSxi component of spin polarization is probed us-
ing optical rotation of a DFB laser beam propagating
along the ˆx direction and detuned about 1 GHz away
from the D1 resonance. Synchronous optical pumping
of quantum revivals is shown in Fig. 1 with a 10% duty

cycle for secondary modulation. Beating between diﬀer-
ent Zeeman coherences causes the polarization envelope
to reappear with a period 2/νrev. As shown in Fig. 1a),
the shape of the revival envelope is in agreement with
a density matrix simulation. The revivals persist indeﬁ-
nitely, until at t = 60 msec the pumping light is turned
oﬀ, showing free spin precession with many quantum re-
vivals with amplitude decaying due to spin relaxation.

To obtain a magnetic resonance signal, the amplitude
of optical rotation at the Larmor frequency, proportional
to hSxi, is recorded by a lock-in ampliﬁer and sampled
by a sample-and-hold circuit triggered at times of max-
imum revival. For optimal detection of spin precession
the probe laser can be turned on only during revivals
with a duty factor d and a power increased by a factor of
1/d relative to optimal continuous measurement, giving
the same shot noise sensitivity.

Figure 2 shows the magnetic resonance spectrum for
B ≃ 0.5 G as a function of modulation frequency of the
pump laser current both with (dashed lines) and without
(solid lines) secondary modulation at 530 Hz with a 1%
duty cycle. Without secondary modulation the resonance
spectrum consists of 4 lines corresponding to individual
F = 2, mF → mF + 1 Zeeman transitions. With sec-
ondary modulation there is a central resonance at νL,
strictly proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld, and a number
of sidebands spaced by 2νrev. The density matrix simu-
lation shown in Fig. 2a predicts that the maximum spin
polarization is increased by a factor of 6 relative to the
case without secondary modulation due to constructive
interference between all Zeeman coherences; the experi-
mental data plotted in Fig. 2b show an increase of the
spin polarization by a factor of 3.9. The linewidth of the
resonances is kept the same so higher spin polarization
directly translates into higher magnetometer sensitivity.
The heading errors in atomic magnetometers can be
simply understood as resulting from overlap of the multi-
ple Zeeman resonances [23]. For well-resolved resonances,
as in Fig. 2, the magnetometer is locked to the strongest
resonance and the heading error is due to tails of other
resonances that change in size depending on the orien-
tation of the pump laser relative to the magnetic ﬁeld
because of changes in the longitudinal spin polarization.
The frequency shift of a particular resonance with fre-
quency ν0 and amplitude A0 due to the tails of other
Lorentizan resonances can be estimated as

3

lines obtained with secondary modulation are symmetri-
cal and do not systematically change relative size with
tilting of the ﬁeld, so the tails of various peaks cancel
and do not lead to a signiﬁcant heading error.

We also point out the general applicability of the
double-modulation technique by demonstrating that it
works for a common “Mx”-type magnetometer [23] us-
ing an rf ﬁeld to excite spin precession. For this data the
magnetic ﬁeld is directed along ˆz, parallel to the pump
laser, which is not modulated and remains tuned to the
D1 resonance. Spin precession is excited by a transverse
rf ﬁeld at the Larmor frequency which is similarly mod-
ulated at twice the revival frequency with 1% duty cy-
cle and 180◦ phase reversal for odd pulses. The solid
line in Fig. 2d) shows continuous rf excitation while the
dashed line shows rf excitation with secondary modula-
tion. The amplitude of the rf ﬁeld is adjusted to generate
the same level of rf broadening, ensuring equal widths of
the resonances. As with optical excitation, we observe
an increase in sensitivity by approximately a factor of 3
and a symmetrical set of sidebands that does not cause
a signiﬁcant heading error.

We use a numerical simulation for a general analysis
of polarization gains and heading errors. We calculate
the time evolution of the alkali-metal ground state den-
sity matrix in the presence of doubly-modulated pump-
ing and simulate lock-in detection, generating resonance
spectra (see Fig. 2a) that are similar to experimental
data. The magnetometer sensitivity and the resonance
frequency are determined, respectively, from the slope
and the zero-crossing of the dispersion curves. Fig. 3
shows the gain in sensitivity due to higher spin polariza-
tion for K as a function of resonance linewidth. We also

Magnetometer signals recorded with the magnetic ﬁeld

man resonances without secondary modulation change
signiﬁcantly depending on ﬁeld orientation, leading to a

FIG. 4: The heading error determined from numerical sim-
ulation as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld tilt angle θ away
from the y axis into the direction of the pump beam. With
no secondary modulation the heading error depends on the
resonance linewidth (solid line - Γ = 13 Hz, dash-dot line -
Γ = 26 Hz), while with secondary modulation the heading
error is approximately quadratic in θ and is independent of
the resonance linewdith (dashed line - Γ = 13 Hz, dotted line
- Γ = 26 Hz). Inset a) shows that without secondary modu-
lation the slope of the heading error near θ = 0 scales as Γ2.
Inset b) shows that with secondary modulation the curvature
of the heading error near θ = 0 scales as B3, indicating that
it is due to third-order splitting of the energy levels.

investigated the case of Cs with I=7/2 and found that
the increase in maximum spin polarization and the gain
in sensitivity is about a factor of 2 higher than in K due
to coherent interference of a larger number of levels. Sec-
ondary modulation also helps to resolve individual reso-

4

nances when Γ ∼ νrev, as demonstrated experimentally
in the inset of Fig. 3, leading to additional gain in sensi-
tivity over the case of continuous pumping in this regime.
The heading error, which is usually on the order of νrev
when the individual resonances are poorly resolved, can
also be signiﬁcantly reduced by locking to one of the re-
solved resonances, which remain symmetrical when the
magnetic ﬁeld is tilted.

In Fig. 4 we show the heading error as a function of
magnetic ﬁeld tilt angle θ into the direction of the pump
beam. Without secondary modulation the heading error
is approximately linear near θ = 0 and scales with the
square of the resonance linewidth Γ, as predicted by Eq.
(2). In contrast, the heading error with secondary mod-
ulation is quadratic near θ = 0 and does not depend on
the resonance linewidth, making the magnetometer less
susceptible to magnetic gradient broadening; it is instead
due to cubic energy level splitting and scales as B3/ν2
hf .
We expect the heading error with secondary modulation
to be much smaller for Rb or Cs with larger νhf . For
comparison, most existing atomic magnetometers have
heading errors on the order of 10 nT and can achieve 0.1
nT level only with very narrow resonance lines [23].

In conclusion, we demonstrated synchronous pumping
of quantum revivals and shown that it can be used to in-
crease the degree of atomic orientation. We also ﬁnd that
the resulting resonance lineshape is symmetric, which is
important for reducing systematic errors in frequency
measurements on multi-level systems. Our results are
directly applicable to alkali-metal magnetometers oper-
ating in geomagnetic ﬁeld range and can be used to in-
crease their sensitivity and reduce heading errors. This
work was funded by an Oﬃce of Naval Research MURI
grant and the NSF.

The asymmetry of the natural line proﬁle for transitions in hydrogen-like atoms
is evaluated within a QED framework. For the Lyman-alpha 1s − 2p absorption
transition in neutral hydrogen this asymmetry results in an additional energy shift
of 2.929856 Hz. For the 2s1/2 − 2p3/2 transition it amounts to -1.512674 Hz. As a
new feature this correction turns out to be process dependent. The quoted numbers
refer to the Compton-scattering process.

The problem of the natural line proﬁle in atomic physics was considered ﬁrst in terms of quantum
mechanics by Weisskopf and Wigner [1]. Within the framework of modern QED it was ﬁrst formu-
lated for one-electron atoms by Low [2]. In [2] the occurance of the Lorentz proﬁle in the resonance
approximation was described and the non-resonant corrections were estimated. Later the line proﬁle
QED theory has been modiﬁed also for many-electron atoms [3] (see also [4]) and has been applied to
the theory of overlapping resonances in two-electron highly charged ions [5]. Within this formalism
corrections to the energy levels, e.g. reference state QED corrections, have been evaluated [6].

One of the important consequences of the line proﬁle theory is the occurance of non-resonant
corrections [2]. These corrections indicate the limit up to which the concept of the energy of an
excited atomic state has a physical meaning - that is the resonance approximation. The exact
theoretical value for the energy of an excited state deﬁned, e.g., by the Green function pole, can be
compared directly with measurable quantities only within the resonance approximation, for which the
line proﬁle is described by the two parameters: energy E and width Γ. Beyond this approximation
the evaluation of E and Γ should be replaced by the evaluation of the line proﬁle for the particular
process.
If the distortion of the Lorentz proﬁle is still small one can formally consider the non-
resonant correction as a correction to the energy shift. Unlike all other energy corrections, this
correction depends on the particular process under consideration which has been employed for the
measurement of the energy diﬀerence. The non-resonant (NR) corrections were considered for H-like
ions of phosphorus (Z = 15) and uranium (Z = 92) in [7], [8]. While for uranium the NR correction
was found to be negligible, its value was comparable with the experimental inaccuracy in the case
of phosphorus.

In this paper we demonstrate that the concept of a transition energy depends on the measurement
process. For this reason we evaluate the NR corrections for the neutral hydrogen atom. We consider
the process of the resonance Compton scattering as a standard procedure for the determination of
the energy levels. For this process the parametric estimate of the NR correction can be expressed
as [2] (in relativistic units).

δ = Cmα2(αZ)6

(1)

where C is some numerical factor, α is the ﬁne structure constant, Z is the nuclear charge number.
The recent QED calculations for low-Z H-like atoms incorporate corrections of the order of
mα2(αZ)5 [9] - [12]; corrections of order mα2(αZ)6 ln3(αZ) are also included [13], [14]. For low-Z
accurate Lamb-shift calculations to all orders in Zα have been performed recently [15], [16].

Thus in principle the next order corrections to the energy levels should include NR corrections
and will depend on the process of measurement under consideration. However the numerical factor
C in Eq. (1) appears to be quite small: 10−3 for the Lyman-alpha transition (see below). There
are no direct measurements of the Lyman-α transition frequency with an accuracy required in
order to observe the correction Eq. (1). Modern experimental techniques employed in Lamb-shift
measurements are based on two-photon resonances, e.g. for the transition 2s -1s [17] - [19]. Although

1

the theoretical evaluation of the NR corrections to the two-photon resonances is more involved, we
can state that the corresponding NR corrections will be of the same order of magnitude as the one
considered here.

Consider the process of photon scattering on a one-electron atom. This process is described by
the two Feynman diagrams of Fig. 1. Resonance scattering implies that the frequency of the initial
EB where A′ is some excited atomic state, B
photon ω is close to the energy diﬀerence ω = EA′
is the initial state. Within the resonance approximation we retain only the term n = A′ in the sum
over intermediate states in the amplitude, corresponding to Fig. 1a. The amplitude, corresponding
to Fig. 1b, has a non-resonant character. Separating out the resonant term we express the amplitude
corresponding to Fig. 1 in the form

The second and third term in Eq. (2) represent the non-resonant corrections to the scattering

The Lorentz line proﬁle arises when we sum up all the electron self-energy insertions in the internal

In the resonance approximation we can substitute ω + EA = EA′ in the denominator of Eq. (3).
The real part of the matrix element ˆΣR(ω + EA))A′A′ yields the lowest-order contribution to the
Lamb shift while the imaginary part which is ﬁnite and not subject to renormalization indicates the

An additional contribution to the lowest-order Lamb shift LVP

Thus the value of ωmax for the probability distribution in the photon scattering process cannot
be compared directly with the energy diﬀerence between the two levels. The process-dependent
non-resonant correction δ should be taken into account. This result holds also if we include any
QED corrections in EA′ , EB. The order of magnitude of the correction δ follows from the standard
estimates for the allowed transition probabilities (also the ”mixed” ones) mα(αZ)4 and the transition
energies m(αZ)2:

[mα(αZ)4]2
m(αZ)2 = mα2(αZ)6

These orders of magnitude are the same whether or not the level EA′ is removed from EB by a

ﬁne (hyperﬁne) structure splitting [2].

Consider now the neutral hydrogen atom in the non-relativistic approximation. We put B =
A = 1s, A′ = 2p. Then the line proﬁle will correspond to the Lyman-α transition. In this case
ΓA′ = ΓAA′ = WBA′ and the matrix elements of the electron-photon interaction are

the distortion of these two peaks is equal and deﬁned by Eq. (33).

Concluding, we can state that the NR corrections are comparable with some QED corrections
to the Lamb shift recently included in the consideration [12]. The level of accuracy of modern
1s is estimated in total to be
experiments with neutral hydrogen for the two-photon transition 2s
46 Hz [19] and is approaching the magnitude of these non-resonant corrections. The derivation of the
two-photon NR corrections requires consideration of two-photon resonance scattering on a hydrogen
atom. The corresponding expression for the amplitude will contain two energy denominators unlike
as in Eq. (2). However, only one of them will become resonant while the other one appears as a
nonresonant factor and will not change the order of magnitude of the total amplitude. Accordingly,
the interference term (13) deﬁning the resonance shift will lead to values of the same order of
magnitude as the corrections (33) and (34), respectively.

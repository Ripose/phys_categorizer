Abstract

The emergence of a multiplet structure of the helium-like ions is studied within Rela-

tivistic Schr¨odinger Theory (RST), a ﬂuid-dynamic approach to the relativistic quantum

theory of the many-particle systems. The ﬂuid-dynamic character of RST demands to

specify the electronic current densities jµ for any N -particle conﬁguration which is ex-

empliﬁed here by considering the helium singlet (1S0) and triplet (3S1) states in great

detail. Since the use of densities in RST is based upon the concept of wave functions, the

new theory appears as a certain kind of (relativistic) uniﬁcation of the conventional wave

function formalism and the density functional theory, which both are the most prominent

theoretical tools in atomic and molecular physics. As a demonstration of the practical

usefulness of RST, the energy diﬀerence ∆E1\2 of the helium singlet states 2s2 1S0 and

1s2 1S0 is calculated for a large range of nuclear charge numbers zex (2

zex ≤

≤

100),

whereas the corresponding experimental values are available only up to zex = 42 (molyb-

denum). The deviations of these RST results from the observational data is less than

0, 3%.

INTRODUCTION AND SURVEY OF RESULTS

Surely, from the classical conception of the world, the strangest feature of the

quantum phenomena refers to the so-called wave-particle duality [1], [2]. Indeed,

such a kind of ”duality” represents a certain dilemma for theoretical physics which

always tries to erect a mathematically unique and logically coherent view upon the

material world; whereas the notorious wave-particle duality forces us to describe

the elementary matter sometimes in terms of ﬂuid dynamics (wave picture) and

sometimes in terms of point particle dynamics (particle picture) with its associ-

ated probabilistic interpretation. The latter picture is favourable when dealing

with statistical ensembles of particles [3], and the wave picture is to be preferred

for the treatment of quantum liquids [4].

In view of such an ambiguous theoretical situation, any progress towards a uni-

ﬁcation of both pictures should be welcome; no matter whether it refers more to

the particle picture or rather to the wave conception of matter. Probably, greater

eﬀorts have been undertaken in the last decades to further develop and elaborate

the particle picture in connection with quantum statistics, but with the recent

experimental realization of the Bose-Einstein condensates [5] the interest in using

ﬂuid-dynamic concepts in quantum theory has been revived.

Concerning the competition of both conceptual lines of thinking with respect

to the production of testable predictions for the outcomes of real experiments,

it should be especially interesting to consider those ﬁelds of ”intersection” where

the predictive power of both theoretical approaches may be directly opposed to

each other and to the observational data. Naturally such a ﬁeld could be atomic

physics where experimental spectroscopy can establish very precisely the energy

level systems of the many-electron systems. Selecting this ﬁeld of physics as the

arena of competition provides us with an additional advantage, namely the possi-

bility to oppose the potentiality of both approaches to each other, especially when

one has to take into account also the relativistic eﬀects which for higher nuclear

3

charge number (zex & 30, say) can no longer be neglected. Furthermore, within

the conventional (i.e. particle) approach, one can take into account also the QED

corrections in order to shift the predictions closer to the experimental data. This

then must necessarily force the proponents of the ﬂuid-dynamic picture to think

about the incorporation of self-energy eﬀects into their theory. Thus the arena for

the competition seems to be well-prepared; but where are the competitors?

On the conventional (i.e. point-particle) side, it is somewhat dissapointing to

see that there does not exist a generally applicable and well-working relativis-

tic quantum mechanics for many-particle systems. A possible candidate could

have been the Bethe-Salpeter type of equations which however are aﬄicted with

many deﬁciencies (see the critical evaluation of the Bethe-Salpeter equations in

the literature, e.g. ref.s [6, 7]. Here the main problem seems to refer to the gen-

eralization of the non-relativistic probabilistic concepts to the relativistic domain,

which would imply to encode into the mathematical apparatus the tensor product

of one-particle Hilbert spaces as the N-particle Hilbert space. As a consequence,

there exist merely some auxiliary constructions in order to take account for the

relativistic eﬀects in atoms and molecules: Dirac-Fock approximation [8], multi-

conﬁguration Dirac-Fock method (MCDF) [8, 9], all-order technique in relativistic

many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) [10], or relativistic 1

Z -expansion method
[11]. For an overview of approximation methods (being based upon the tensor

product construction), see ref. [12].

However, the incorporation of the relativistic laws is no problem for a ﬂuid-

dynamic theory, as is demonstrated by the recently established Relativistic

Schr¨odinger Theory (RST) [13, 14, 15], which is based upon the Whitney sum

of the one-particle bundles in place of the tensor product construction. Some pre-

liminary tests of RST in the ﬁeld of atomic physics have already demonstrated

that the numerical predictions of this new theory are rather better than worse in

comparison to the standard quantum theory, even if the QED self-energy eﬀects

4

are taken into account (see ref.s [15, 16]).

But there seems to arise a certain type of problem for the Whitney sum con-

struction, which is not present for the conventional tensor product formalism and

whose solution is the aim of study of the present paper: this refers to the multiplet

structure of the many-electron conﬁgurations in atoms. In order to have a simple

demonstration of how to proceed in more complicated situations, one may consider

here the singlet (1S0) and triplet (3S1) conﬁgurations of the helium-like ions with

arbitrary nuclear charge numbers zex (2

100). Neglecting ﬁrst the spin-

zex ≤

≤

spin interactions and the relativistic eﬀects, one can start with some Schr¨odinger

energy level of conventional notation (ns, n′s) where the principal quantum num-

bers are denoted by n, n′ and the orbital angular momentum is zero (l = l′ = 0), so

that both (non-relativistic) electrons are in an s-state (see ﬁg.3 below). Switching

now on the spin-spin interactions (and also the relativistic eﬀects) lets the four

diﬀerent spin states of the Schr¨odinger conﬁgurations (ns, n′s) split up into one

singlet state (of conventional notation n1s, n2s 1S0) and three degenerate triplet
states (n1s, n2s 3S1). This multiplet splitting of the energy levels emerges in a very

natural way within the (non-relativistic) tensor product formalism.

Thus, the question arises now for the new theory: In what way does this mul-

tiplet structure emerge in RST? Observe here that the spin phenomenon in RST

is traced back to some rotational ﬂow of the wave function, principally not being

diﬀerent from the mechanism for the generation of the orbital angular momentum.

Therefore the speciﬁcation of the RST two-electron multiplet structure must con-

sist in ﬁxing the geometric pattern of the currents due to the singlet (1S0) and
triplet (3S1) conﬁgurations. Our proposition for the solution of this problem is the

following:

|S = 1; Sz = +1 >

|S = 1; Sz = −1 >

|S = 1; Sz = 0 >

|S = 0; Sz = 0 >

The two triplet conﬁgurations with conventional notation

S = 1; Sz =

1 > are

|

±

described in RST by letting both electronic currents encircle the z-axis, either in

the positive or negative sense. However, the ”exotic” spin state

S = 1; Sz = 0 >

|

is due to a rotational ﬂow in the plane containing the z-axis so that no non-trivial
z-component of the total electronic spin ~S can arise (Sz = 0); but nevertheless

there does exist a rotational ﬂow (S = 1)! On the other hand, the singlet states

1S0 are assumed to be due to the two currents encircling the z-axis in opposite

directions such that both the total spin quantum number S and its z-component

Sz are zero:

S = 0; Sz = 0 >, see the illustration above.

|

The intention of the present paper is to elaborate this proposition from the

mathematical point of view and test its physical consequences with respect to the

spectroscopic data. The energy eigenvalue equations for the singlet and triplet

states are set up within the RST formalism; but the triplet case is too complicated

to obtain a numerical solution which could be used in order to demonstrate the

degeneracy of the three states

eigenvalue problem which can be solved numerically so that a comparison to the

experimental data [17] is possible. More concretely, we numerically solve the RST

eigenvalue problem for the singlet states 2s2 1S0 and 1s2 1S0 in order to calculate

the corresponding energy diﬀerence (∆E1\2) by taking the value of the RST en-

ergy functional upon the numerical solutions. Both situations, with included and

neglected self-interactions, are considered, and it is found that the RST predic-

tions deviate from the corresponding experimental values [17] by less than 0.3%,

see table I and ﬁg.4 below. This result is somewhat amazing because the non-

relativistic limit of RST coincides with the Hartree-Fock approach which misses

the exchange eﬀects for the singlet states (see ﬁg.3 below and the discussion in

ref.[18]). Thus, the conclusion is that the exchange eﬀect does not act in a com-

pletely symmetric way upon the singlet and triplet states (as suggested by the

standard theory), but is weakened for the singlet states. The mechanism of the

RST self-interactions is discussed in detail; this elucidates the result that the in-

clusion of the self-interactions can hardly improve the ”semiclassical” value for the

energy diﬀerence ∆E1/2.

The results are elaborated by the following arrangement:

In Sect.II a brief sketch of the fundamental RST features is presented in order

to realize clearly the diﬀerences from the standard quantum theory. Here it should

become obvious that RST is a rather general ﬁeld theoretical framework whose in-

dispensible features refer only to the (local) conservation of energy-momentum and

charge, but otherwise leave great freedom to reify the general structure. Special

realizations of RST refer to the Klein-Gordon theory of scalar particles and to the

Dirac theory of spin-1/2 electrons; the latter realization is taken as the basis for

the subsequent discussions.

Sect.III establishes the general RST eigenvalue problem for the helium-like

ions, see equations (3.23)-(3.26d) below. This eigenvalue problem must be com-

plemented by the speciﬁcation of an energy functional (ET , say), whose values

7

upon the solutions of the eigenvalue problem yield the desired atomic energy lev-

els. The general structure of this RST energy functional is typical for the Whitney

sum construction to be used for the ﬂuid-dynamic approach in place of the ten-

(

sor product construction: the total energy ET equals the sum of mass eigenvalues
Mac2) minus those interaction contributions (∆ET ) which are already included
P
in each one of the mass eigenvalues Mac2 and are therefore counted twice if one

simply forms the sum of the mass eigenvalues, see equations (3.35)-(3.36) below.

In Sect.IV, the general two-particle theory is cut down to the triplet conﬁg-

urations 3S1 (ortho-helium), whose RST structure is then studied in great detail.

Naturally both states

S = 1; Sz =

1 > with non-zero spin-component Sz have a

|

±

very similar geometric structure, so that it is suﬃcient to write explicitely down

only one of both conﬁgurations (i.e.

S = 1; Sz = +1 >). In contrast to these

|

relatively simple conﬁgurations which admit a convenient non-relativistic approx-

imation, the state

S = 1; Sz = 0 > with vanishing spin component Sz has a

|

distinctly diﬀerent geometric structure (see the ﬁgure above) so that it seems very

diﬃcult to obtain an approximate solution to the corresponding eigenvalue prob-

lem (see equations (4.8)-(4.13b) below). Therefore the question of degeneracy of

all three states

S = 1; Sz = 0,

1 > must be left unclariﬁed for the moment (the

degeneracy of both states

1 > is self-evident).

|

±
S = 1; Sz =

|

±

Sect.V presents a detailed study of the singlet states 1S0 (para-helium). These

RST counterparts of the conventional states

S = 0; Sz = 0 > have the peculiarity

|

of vanishing exchange density, so that no exchange interactions (of the ”electric”

type) do exist between the two electrons. Since the ”electric” interactions are

mostly much stronger than their ”magnetic” counterparts, the para-helium levels

are not shifted (in lowest-order approximation) by the RST exchange interactions,

which is in contrast to the predictions of the standard quantum theory being based

upon the tensor product formalism, see ﬁg.3 below. Therefore it may appear as if

RST, and the Hartree-Fock approach as its non-relativistic limit, would produce

8

inaccurate predictions of the para-helium energy levels.

This supposition is then tested explicitely in Sect.VI by numerically solving the

RST eigenvalue problem of Sect.V for the isotropic states ns2 1S0 of para-helium

for principal quantum numbers n = 1 and n = 2. This admits us to compute the

corresponding energy diﬀerence ∆E1\2 for the para-helium states

and to compare our RST result to the experimental values [17]. Unfortunately

the analogous results have been omitted by the other theoretical approaches being

conveniently available in the literature, i.e. the all-order technique in MBPT [10]

and the 1

Z -expansion method [11]. The result of this comparison is very favourable
its predictions for the energy diﬀerence

for the present ﬂuid-dynamic approach:

∆E1\2 deviate from the experimental values [17] by less than 0.3% and do approach

them even better for increasing nuclear charge number zex (ﬁg.4). This signals that

the missing of the ”electric” exchange energy for the singlet states in the RST and

Hartree-Fock approaches may not merely be an artefact of the formalism but

actually points to the existence of a real eﬀect in the atomic structure! The RST

predictions for the energy diﬀerence ∆E1\2 (1.1) are extended beyond the largest,

experimentally available nuclear charge number (i.e. zex = 42, molybdenum) where

it must be left to future experiments to verify or falsiﬁate the RST results in this

ultra-relativistic regime (Table II).

II. RST DYNAMICS

Similar to most of the modern gauge theories of elementary matter, the funda-

mental equations of motion represent also in RST a coupled system of matter and

gauge ﬁelds. In the present context, the gauge ﬁeld equations are considered to be

even more fundamental than the matter ﬁeld equations since the latter type be-

comes subjected to certain restrictions in order to guarantee the conservation laws

9

(e.g. for charge and energy-momentum); and these restrictions directly originate

from the gauge ﬁeld dynamics. Here it will turn out that the well-known wave

equations of conventional quantum theory (i.e. of Dirac and Klein-Gordon type,

respectively) do represent only a restricted set of possible matter equations which

however are suﬃcient to ensure the desired conservation laws. Though this restric-

tive set has an acceptable non-relativistic limit (i.e. the Hartree-Fock equations

[13, 19]), it may be nevertheless insuﬃcient to cover all relativistic many-particle

situations. Subsequently it is demonstrated that RST is able to provide a more

general class of relativistic wave equations; however, for our present treatment of

ortho- and para-helium we are satisﬁed with the Dirac realization of RST.

The present procedure of generalizing the classical wave equations of Dirac and

Klein-Gordon is based upon the use of a new ﬁeld variable, i.e. the Hamiltonian
Hµ, which itself is a dynamical object of the theory and obeys its own ﬁeld equa-
Hµ may be conceived as some kind of
tions (Hamiltonian dynamics). This object
hidden variable which guides the matter through the ”landscape” of gauge ﬁelds

the original restricted set of ﬁeld equations, the Hamiltonian

just in such a way that the desired conservation laws for matter are ensured. For
Hµ can be again
eliminated, so that the conventional wave equations of Dirac and Klein-Gordon do

reappear. However, for the more general ﬁeld conﬁgurations (and especially for
Hµ cannot be eliminated and remains

the relativistic mixtures) the Hamiltonian

an essential part of the dynamical system.

According to the logical dominance of the gauge system, we ﬁrst write down

the corresponding dynamical equations in order to deduce thereof the restrictions

for the motion of matter; and afterwards we introduce the Hamiltonian in such a

way that these restrictions (i.e. conservation laws) are actually obeyed.

A similar self-consistency problem for the coupled matter and gauge ﬁeld dy-

namics arises for the energy-momentum density of matter ((M)Tµν, say): According

to the general logical structure of the gauge ﬁeld theories, one expects that the

well-known Lorentz force density (L)fν should act as the generator of the matter

energy-momentum, i.e.

µ (M)Tµν = (L)fν .

will consist of an external part (ex)fν and an internal part (S)fν

A very pleasant feature of RST is now that both self-consistency problems (2.14)

and (2.15) for the motion of matter can be solved in one step, namely by setting

up the right equation of motion together with a suitable deﬁnition of currents jα
µ
and energy-momentum (M )Tµν. The interesting point here is that the conventional

ﬁeld equations of matter (i.e. Dirac and Klein-Gordon) do reappear only as a

restricted subset of a larger set of possibilities.

B. Matter Dynamics

The RST description of matter is based upon the intensity matrix

, which is

a Hermitian (4N

4N)-matrix (¯
I

×

I

=

) for a system of N fermions. If this system

is to be described by a pure state Ψ, the intensity matrix

degenerates to the

I

tensor product of Ψ:

The ﬁeld equation for

Hµ (Hamilto-

which in combination with the matter dynamics (2.21)-(2.22) just ensures the

validity of those bundle identities (2.24a)-(2.24b).

C. Charge Conservation

The second ﬁeld equation for the Hamiltonian

Hµ, which is a gl(4N, C)-valued
one-form, must now refer to the guarantee of the conservation laws discussed in

the preceding subsection. For this purpose, one ﬁrst introduces the total velocity
operator Γµ as a Hermitian one-form (¯Γµ = Γµ) which takes its values also in the

Lie algebra gl(4N, C). By means of this object, one alternatively deﬁnes the total

electromagnetic current jµ (2.17) through

(2.24a)

(2.24b)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

and then one requires this current to obey the conservation law

Indeed, adding up both source equations (2.14a) and (2.14b) for the two-particle

situation (N = 2) actually yields a result which just coincides with the present

jµ + tr(

Γµ)

µjµ = 0.

conservation law (2.27). Thus, in this special respect, our choice of the matter

dynamics would be consistent with the gauge ﬁeld dynamics, provided we suceed

in deducing the conservation law (2.27) also from the proposed matter dynamics

(2.22). However, this can easily be done by simply transcribing the derivative

(2.27) of the current jµ (2.26) to the intensity matrix

and using the RNE (2.22)

I

(or the RSE (2.23) for the case of a pure state) which ultimately yields

(2.29)

This equation is to be understood in the sense that for given Hamiltonian

Hµ(x)
(as solution of the Hamiltonian dynamics) the total velocity operator Γµ must be

a solution of its source equation (2.29).

Next, one turns to the operator-valued continuity equation (2.13) which reads

in component form

Dµjαµ = 0 ,

(2.30)

with its contravariant two-particle realization being given by equations (2.14a)-

(2.14d). Here the covariant derivative (D) of the gauge objects is deﬁned through

(2.32)

18

and the structure constants C α

βγ are deﬁned through the usual commutation re-

lations

[τα, τβ] = C γ

αβ τγ .

(2.33)

Now in order to ensure the desired validity of the source equation (2.30) for the

gauge currents jαµ, one introduces the gauge velocity operators υαµ which then

build up the currents jαµ through

jαµ = tr (

υαµ) ,

I ·

(2.34)

similarly to the construction of the total current jµ (2.26). Accordingly, the tran-

scription of the derivative (D) of jαµ in equation (2.30) to the gauge velocity

operators υαµ (2.34) yields a result quite analogous to equation (2.28), i.e.

Dµjαµ = tr

(cid:19)(cid:27)

(cid:1)

(2.35)

Therefore, in order to satisfy the requirement (2.30), one adopts the velocity op-

erators υαµ to be solutions of the following source equation:

where the covariant derivative of the gauge operators is deﬁned through

However, in order to not introduce too many new objects requiring their own

ﬁeld equations, one would like to express those gauge velocity operators υαµ in

terms of the already existing objects τα and Γµ, i.e. we try to identify υαµ as the

anticommutator of the gauge algebra generators τα and the total velocity Γµ:

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

Since the electromagnetic generators τa (a = 1, . . . , N) are adopted to be anti-
τa) and the velocity operator is taken to be Hermitian (¯Γµ =

Hermitian (¯τa =

υαµ =

i
2 {

τα, Γµ}

19

Γµ), the electromagnetic velocity operators υaµ (a = 1, . . . , N) are also Hermitian

(υaµ = ¯υaµ) and consequently the electromagnetic currents jaµ (a = 1, . . . , N)

(2.34) are real, just as the electromagnetic potentials Aa

µ and their ﬁeld strengths

F a
1, . . . , N (N −1)

µν. In contrast to this, the remaining N(N-1) exchange generators (χk, ¯χk; k =
pairs of Hermitian conjugate operators, so

) are arranged in N (N −1)

that the exchange potentials Bk

µ and their ﬁeld strengths Gk

µν are complex, as

well as the corresponding exchange currents hk

µ; see for instance the two-particle

realization (2.11b)-(2.11e) of such an arrangement.

Introducing the chosen ansatz (2.38) for the velocity operators υαµ into their

ﬁeld equation (2.36) must then necessarily yield some condition upon the total

velocity operator Γµ, namely one ﬁnds the following combination of commutators

[ .. , .. ] and anti-commutators

(2.39)

(cid:8)
Thus, summarizing the situation with the charge conservation laws, it becomes

(cid:9)

clear that both conservation laws (2.27) and (2.30) can simultaneously be satisﬁed

by requiring the total velocity operator Γµ to obey the former equation (2.29) and

let it commute with the gauge algebra generators τα

[τα, Γµ] = 0 .

(2.40)

However, observe here that these two conditions are actually suﬃcient to guarantee

the total charge conservation (2.27) but leave us with one remaining term for the

gauge continuity equation (2.30). More concretely, introducing the (Hermitian)

mass operator

D. Energy-Momentum Conservation

Before one can make a ﬁnal decision for the choice of the total velocity operator

ﬁeld equation (conservation equation) for the Hamiltonian

Γµ as a solution of its source equation (2.29), one must ﬁrst specify the second
Hµ. Here one expects
Hµ will emerge in connection with an energy-momentum
conservation law for matter. More concretely, one tries to introduce the energy-

that this equation for

momentum density of matter ((M )Tµν, say) in such a way that its source is just
the well-known Lorentz force density (L)fν (2.16) due to the external and internal

gauge ﬁelds. This idea may be realized by ﬁrst deﬁning an energy-momentum
Tµν, say) through

operator for fermionic matter ((M )

(M )

Tµν =

ΓµHν + ¯
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

and then the energy-momentum density for matter (M )Tµν is obtained quite simi-

larly as for the current densities (2.26) or (2.34) by putting

Tµν yields just the corresponding Lorentz force operator

Here, according to the original idea (2.48), the right-hand side must yield the

Lorentz-force operator (L)fν which is to be conceived as the product of velocity

operators and curvature components, see the ﬁrst term. Obviously, in order to

achieve this goal, one can resort to the previous equation (2.29) which puts the

RST divergence of the total velocity operator Γµ to zero; but this is of course not
Hµ must be adopted. Any
such choice, which then validates the charge conservation laws (2.27), (2.30) and

suﬃcient, and further assumptions concerning Γµ and

22

the energy-momentum conservation (or balance, resp.) law (2.15), is considered as

a particular realization of RST. We now turn to the most important one of these

realizations.

E. Dirac Realization of RST

certain conditions upon the velocity operator Γµ and the Hamiltonian

Evidently the requirement of conservation laws can be expressed in terms of
Hµ. First
consider the case of Γµ which must have vanishing RST divergence (2.29) and is

required to commute with the gauge algebra generators τα, cf.(2.40), in order that

the charge conservation laws be satisﬁed. An additional condition arises from the

requirement of energy-momentum balance (2.48) and (2.50) where we assume now

also the vanishing of the curl of Γµ

DµΓν − DνΓµ = 0 .

(2.51)

However, we even want to go one step further and put the covariant derivative of

Γµ to zero

DµΓν = 0 .
Fortunately this implies a great simpliﬁcation of the mathematical formalism, be-

(2.52)

cause, on account of the commutation relations (2.40), one can always choose a

gauge where (at least locally) the velocity operator Γµ is absolutely constant:

∂µΓν = 0 .

(2.53)

Thus, the velocity operator becomes a ﬁxed object, independent of any ﬁeld kine-

matics and dynamics. For the Dirac realization of RST, one chooses for Γµ the

N-fold direct sum of the well-known Dirac matrices γµ [13], i.e.

Γµ = γµ ⊕

γµ ⊕ · · · ⊕

γµ .

(2.54)

23

Hµ:

(2.55)

(2.56)

(2.57)

(2.58)

Naturally, such a choice of the velocity operator Γµ must imply further conse-

quences. Returning for the moment to the vanishing RST divergence (2.29) of Γµ,

one deduces from that equation the following relationship between Γµ and

¯
µ
H

Γµ −

·

Γµ

· Hµ = 0 .

¯
µΓµ = Γµ
H

Hµ =

c2 .

Eﬀectively this is a condition of Hermiticity and thus one can simplify the former

mass relation (2.41) to

Furthermore, for the Dirac realization of RST for a system of identical particles, cf.

(2.44), the proper gauge continuity equation (2.30) is implied by the more general

relation (2.43). For non-identical particles, one puts the currents and potentials

of the exchange type to zero, so that the source system (2.30) becomes reduced to

N true conservation laws (a = 1, . . . , N)

Indeed, this is obtained from the general relation (2.43) by linear combination of

the mass operator

from the electromagnetic generators τa alone:

M

with real-valued particle masses Ma. In the present paper, we however treat exclu-

sively identical particles and will therefore always apply the identical-mass relation

(2.44) in combination with the Dirac realization.

Finally, the source equation of the Hamiltonian

Hµ must be determined in such
a way that the right-hand side of the divergence relation (2.50) for the energy-
Tµν can really adopt the desired Lorentz form as indicated
by the former claim (2.48). However, this goal can be attained by adopting the

momentum operator (M )

In order to convince oneself that RST can predict qualitatively the correct mul-

tiplet structure of the atomic spectra, one will ﬁrst consider a very simple situation,

i.e. the helium problem (two electrons around the ﬁxed nucleus). Here one may

have vanishing angular momentum (L = 0), i.e. the singlet and triplet states 1S0
and 3S1.

The standard (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics (in lowest order of approx-

the ortho-level system but not for the para-level system of helium. Clearly, since

RST is the relativistic generalization of HF, this methodological ambiguity must

transcribe to RST which thus could be expected to be a useful technique only
when dealing with the ortho-states 3S1. However the situation becomes more
favourable also for the para-states 1S0 when one considers high-energy situations

28

(i.e. high nuclear charges Z >> 1) because in this highly relativistic regime it is

more important to take into account the relativistic eﬀects than the correlation

eﬀects beyond Hartree-Fock (see below and ref. [16] for a demonstration of this).

The ortho/para energy shift comes about mainly through separation/crowding

of the electronic charge clouds by (anti-) symmetrizing the spatial parts of the

wave functions relative to the symmetry properties of their spin parts, according

to the Pauli antisymmetrization postulate for the total wave function.

In any case it is necessary and desirable to give an explicit demonstration of

how the singlet and triplet structure of the helium-like atoms does arise within

the framework of RST, so that the problem of the missing exchange energy for the

singlet states can be elucidated, see the discussion below equation (4.18).

A. Stationary Two-Particle States

For a stationary state, one expects that certain physical observables (e.g. en-

ergy) are time-independent, whereas other objects of the theory are admitted to

undergo regular oscillations. Thus the two components ψa(~r, t) (a = 1, 2) of the

30

wave function Ψ are written as

ψ1(~r, t) = exp

ψ2(~r, t) = exp

where the time-independent Dirac spinors ψa(~r) may be further decomposed into
two-component Pauli spinors (a)φ±(~r) according to (a = 1, 2)

ψa(~r) = 

(a)φ+(~r)
(a)φ−(~r)



.



Furthermore, each of the four Pauli spinors (a)φ±(~r) may be decomposed with re-
spect to an orthonormal basis, namely either the basis ζ ±

0 for the upper components

Moreover, the RST-Maxwell equations (2.11b)-(2.11e) clearly demonstrate that the

currents are intimately linked to the gauge potentials and therefore they may be

expected to be both of a similar form. Thus one assumes that the electromagnetic

currents ja

are especially interesting as far as the

geometric diﬀerence between an ortho-ﬁeld and a para-ﬁeld conﬁguration is con-

cerned. Indeed one has to expect that the physical diﬀerence between both ﬁeld

conﬁgurations is ultimately a consequence of the diﬀerent geometric patterns of

the associated ortho- and para-streamlines. The point here is that the spin in RST

is traced back to the rotational ﬂow generated by the wave functions and therefore

the spin-spin interaction emerges as the magnetic ﬁeld energy of those diﬀerent

rotational ﬂows.

These densities and currents are now relevant for the energy eigenvalue problem

insofar as they determine the potentials Aα

µ via the solutions of the RST Maxwell
equations (2.11b) - (2.11e); these potentials then enter the covariant derivatives

Dµψa of the wave functions (2.67a) - (2.67b) which in turn enter the eigenvalue

equations (2.66a) - (2.66b). This will readily become more evident when writing

down now the stationary form of the coupled Dirac system (2.66a) - (2.66b).

C. Mass Eigenvalue Equations

Naturally, the mass eigenvalues Ma (3.7a) - (3.7b) will form an essential con-

stituent of the atomic energy levels (ET , say), but they are not directly identical

with those atomic energies. Rather, one will have to specify the atomic energies

34

ET in terms of an appropriate energy functional, which, besides by the mass eigen-
values (Mac2), is built up also by the energy content of the gauge ﬁelds. However,

the energy contribution of the matter ﬁelds is essentially determined by the sum

of mass-energies (M1c2 + M2c2); and therefore the mass eigenvalue problem must

ﬁrst be solved before the value of the energy functional ET upon the corresponding

solutions of the coupled matter and gauge-ﬁeld system can be calculated.

Once the stationary form of the wave functions has been speciﬁed through

equations (3.7) - (3.12), one simply inserts this stationary ansatz into the coupled

Dirac system (2.66a) - (2.66b) and then ﬁnds the corresponding mass eigenvalue

equations in terms of the wave amplitudes (a)R± and (a)S±. These equations may

perhaps look a little bit lengthy when written down in spherical polar coordinates,

but it is worthwile to display them explicitly because a lot of information about

the peculiarities of the electromagnetic and exchange interactions can be drawn

from them. The equation for the wave amplitude (1)R+ reads

Obviously, the ”positive-energy” component (1)R+ of the ﬁrst particle’s wave func-
tion couples via the electrostatic potential (2)A0 and electric exchange potential
B0 to the ”negative-energy” components (1)R− and (2)R−, respectively; whereas
the coupling to the positive-energy components (1)R+ and (2)R+ occurs via the
magnetic potentials (2)Aϑ and (2)Ar. In contrast to this, the coupling of (1)R+ to
the ”secondary” positive-energy components (a)S+ occurs always via the azimuthal
components (2)Aϕ and Bϕ, respectively. Of course, the coupling of the negative-

Another striking feature of these two-particle interactions concerns the coupling

of the ”primary” amplitudes (a)R± to their ”secondary” counterparts (a)S±, and

vice versa. In order to see this more clearly, one writes down also the eigenvalue

Two remarks must be made concerning the solutions of the mass eigenvalue

some normalization condition upon the single-particle wave functions ψa(~r), i.e.
one needs some normalization condition upon the wave amplitudes (a)R±(~r) and
(a)S±(~r). The desired condition may be deduced in a very natural way from the non-

abelian RST-Maxwell equations (2.11b)-(2.11e): Recasting the electromagnetic

However for our numerical caculations (see below) we will rely upon the exact

Poisson equations which are non-linear on account of the non-abelian character of

the two-particle theory.

D. Energy Functional

In order to test the quality of the RST predictions in atomic physics, it is not

suﬃcient to solve the mass eigenvalue system because the mass eigenvalues Mac2

do in general not coincide with the energy ET carried by the ﬁeld conﬁguration.

The question of energy functional has been considered in great detail in some

preceding papers [15, 23] so that it may suﬃce here to simply quote the main

result:

ET =

Xa=1

Mac2

ˆza ·

∆E(em)

T −

∆E(hg)

(3.35)

The general structure of this result is very plausible because it says that the total

energy ET of any stationary RST conﬁguration is the ”corrected” sum of mass-
energies Mac2.
(∆E(em)
T

Indeed the necessity for the emergence of the electromagnetic

) correction terms arises from the fact that each

) and exchange (∆E(hg)

T

mass energy Mac2 (a = 1, 2) contains already the interaction energy with the

other particle so that this interaction energy becomes then counted twice when

one simply forms the sum of mass energies! This is the reason why the mutual

interaction energy ∆ET

∆ET + ∆E(em)

T + ∆E(hg)

T

(3.36)

must be resubtracted from the sum of mass energies. Since both contributions

themselves consist of two terms (i.e. ” electric” (e; h) and

One can easily show that this somewhat diﬀerent structure of the electric and

magnetic contributions is generated by the combination of the principle of mini-

mal coupling with the Lorentz covariance of the theory. One can also demonstrate

that it is just this speciﬁc relationship between the electric and magnetic eﬀects

which brings the RST predictions close to the experimental data.

In order to see more clearly the speciﬁc way in which the cooperation of min-

imal coupling and Lorentz covariance generate these diﬀerences of the magnetic

and electric energy contributions it may be suﬃcient to demonstrate this for the

41

linear approximation of the RST-Maxwell equations where also the linear Poisson

equations (3.34a)-(3.34d) do hold. Actually, for this simpliﬁed situation, the elec-
trostatic gauge ﬁeld energy E(e)

A similar argument does apply also to the exchange corrections of the electric

However as pleasant as the emergence of such a Lorentz invariant structure may

appear, one should recall that this result is only an approximation. However for

a comparison of the RST predictions with the experimental data one is interested

in the highest numerical precision available, and therefore we will rely for our

E. Mass Functional

Further insight into the nature of the energy functional ET (3.35) is gained by

a closer inspection of the mass eigenvalues Ma which form the main contribution

to the energy ET . Especially, one expects that they should contain also the rest

mass energy (2Mc2) of both particles.

The desired mass functionals are easily obtained by multiplying both sides

of the eigenvalue equations for both particles (i.e. equations (3.23)-(3.25b)) by

the complex conjugate wave amplitudes (a)R∗

±, (a)S∗

± (resp.) and integrating over.

Thereby the desired mass functionals appear in the following form

Mac2 = Z 2

Here, the ﬁrst three terms refer to the one-particle contributions and the remain-

c2 . (3.58)

(a) ·

(cid:1)

ing mass terms contain the two-particle interaction energies. Observe that the

latter kind of contributions has been deﬁned already in equations (3.40a)-(3.40b),

(3.43a)-(3.43b), (3.50a)-(3.50b) and (3.56a)-(3.56b). However, the one-particle

contributions require now some additional explanation. But recall that each mass

eigenvalue Mac2 (a = 1, 2) (3.58) contains the full interaction energy with the

other particle so that this would be counted twice if one omitted the correction

44

terms ∆E(...)

T

for the sum of mass eigenvalues (3.35)!

After the two-particle contributions are clariﬁed now in detail, it is instructive

to inspect also the one-particle terms. First observe here that the rest-mass energy

(Mc2) appears here in combination with the renormalization constants Z 2

(a) being

deﬁned by

Z 2

(a) =

Z

d3~r ¯ψa(~r) ψa(~r) .

(3.59)

These constants cannot be put to unity (i.e. Z 2
(a)

; 1), otherwise the non-

relativistic limit would become incorrect (see the discussion of this point in ref.[13]).

Actually, the renormalization constants Z(a)2 are found to depend upon the ki-

netic energy T (a) of the particles via

Z 2

(a) = 1

T (a)
Mc2 .

−

(3.60)

Next, turn to the single-particle interaction energy E(e)

es which speciﬁes the elec-

trostatic interaction energy of the two-particle system as a whole with the external

source (e.g. nucleus)

E(e)

es =

~c

−

Z

d3~r (ex)A0(~r)

j0(~r) +

ˆzaM (es)
a,e

.

(3.61)

·

2

Xa=1

Here the (electrostatic) external source is characterized by the time-component

((ex)A0) of its four-potential (ex)Aµ, cf. (2.1), and the total charge density j0(~r) is
the sum of both single-particle contributions (a)k0(~r), cf. (2.17),

j0(~r) = (1)k0(~r) + (2)k0(~r) ,

(3.62)

with the single-particle currents (a)k0(~r) being deﬁned in terms of the wave function

ψa(~r) through equations (3.18a)-(3.18b).

Surely, the most intricate one-particle contribution to the mass functional Mac2

(3.58) is the kinetic energy T(a). With respect to the spherical polar coordinates

(r, ϑ, ϕ), this contribution is the sum of three terms

T (a) = (a)Tr + (a)Tϑ + (a)Tϕ

(3.63)

With the eigenvalue equations and the explicit form of the energy functional ET

being at hand now, one becomes able to test the potentiality of RST in the ﬁeld

of the two-electron ions. More concretely, one will ﬁrst solve the mass-eigenvalue

equations (3.23)-(3.25b), etc., together with the Poisson equations (3.34a)-(3.34d);

then one will normalize the solutions according to the prescription (3.32), and

ﬁnally one will compute the desired atomic energy level ET by considering the

value of the energy functional ET (3.35) upon the obtained solutions. However,

46

in order to compare these results rigorously to both the experimental data [17]

and to the results of other theoretical approaches (e.g. 1/Z-expansion method

[11], all-order technique in many-body perturbation theory [10]), we will treat the

original non-linear and non-abelian eigenvalue problem whose linearized version

(3.34a)-(3.34d) we presented here only for the sake of brevity.

IV. TRIPLET STRUCTURE

If RST is equipped with physical meaning, this theory must be able to demon-

strate the emergence of two kinds of helium: namely (i) ortho-helium (parallel

spins) with a triplet structure of its energy levels, and (ii) para-helium (anti-parallel

spins) with a singlet structure (see also ﬁg.3). This means that the totality of so-

lutions of the RST eigenvalue system (3.23)-(3.25b) must be shown to subdivide

into two subsets, the triplet solutions (J = 1) and the singlet solutions (J = 0),
where however the one triplet member 3S1 splits itself up into the three sublevels

being degenerated when no exter-
with conventional notation
nal magnetic ﬁeld ~Hex is present. Thus the ﬁrst task is to identify that subset

S = 1; Sz = 0,

of solutions to the RST eigenvalue system which corresponds to the conventional

triplet states

S = 1; Sz = 0,

.

It should be evident that, when the total magnetic quantum number Sz

(= sz(1) + sz(2)) is extremal (i.e. Sz =

1), then both single-particle spins sz(a)

should point either to the positive or negative z-direction (sz(1) = sz(2) =

1
2).
Accordingly, restricting ourselves to the positive z-direction, we reparametrize for

±

this case the eight ansatz functions (a)R±, (a)S± in our general ansatz (3.9)-(3.10) in

terms of only four real-valued wave amplitudes R±(r, ϑ), S±(r, ϑ) in the following

Once the wave functions ψa(~r) have thus been speciﬁed, one can turn to the

associated ortho-currents. From our equation (3.19) one easily deduces the charge

densities (a)k0(~r) as

Similarly, one ﬁnds from the component equations (3.20a)-(3.20c) that both cur-
rents ~ka(~r) (3.17a) encircle the z-axis in the same direction, i.e.

see the introductory ﬁgure. And ﬁnally the exchange density h0(~r) (3.21) becomes

Moreover, since the gauge potentials are coupled to the currents, see the linear

approximation (3.34a)-(3.34d) hereof, the functional form of the potentials will

be qualitatively the same as for the currents, i.e. we assume that the radial and
longitudinal components of the gauge ﬁelds vanish ((a)Ar = (a)Aϑ = Bϑ ≡

(4.7b)

Here we have assumed that all triplet objects depend exclusively upon the radial

variable r and spherical polar angle ϑ so that the triplet conﬁguration is SO(2)

symmetric around the z-axis.

B. Mass Eigenvalue Equations (S = 1, Sz = +1)

With the general functional form of all static triplet ﬁelds being speciﬁed, one

can introduce these now into the general mass-eigenvalue system (3.23)-(3.26d)

in order to obtain the corresponding eigenvalue system for the triplet states. The

point here is that, through the triplet ansatz (4.1a)-(4.1d), the set of eight complex-

valued wave amplitudes (a)R±(r, ϑ, ϕ), (a)S±(r, ϑ, ϕ) becomes reduced to only four

real-valued wave amplitudes R±(r, ϑ), S±(r, ϑ). Consequently, there arises for each

particle an ordinary Dirac equation for the radial motion, which is however com-

plemented by a separate equation for the longitudinal degree of freedom (described

by the polar angle ϑ). Thus the radial equation for the positive-energy amplitude

49

R+ of the ﬁrst particle (a = 1) is found as

As was mentioned already in connection with the general form of the mass

eigenvalue system (see end of Sect. 3c), the preceding eigenvalue equations (4.8)-

(4.13b) must be complemented by the Poisson equations for the gauge potentials

(a)A0(r, ϑ), Aa(r, ϑ), B(r, ϑ) and β(r, ϑ). For the high-precision calculations in

atomic physics, the linear approximations (3.34a)-(3.34d) are not suﬃcient and

one has to evoke the exact non-linear form of the Poisson equations, see ref.[22].

C. Lowest-Order Approximation

It should not come as a surprise that it is very hard (if not impossible) to ﬁnd

analytic solutions of the preceding mass-eigenvalue problem for the ortho-system.

Therefore one must be satisﬁed with discussing the problem of degeneration of

the triplet states

S = 1; Sz = 0,

in an approximative manner. This may

|

1
±

i

be done by considering the value of the energy functional ET (3.35) upon cer-

tain approximate solutions of the present eigenvalue problem, both for the present

states

S = 1; Sz =

and for the state

S = 1; Sz = 0

which is to be spec-

|

1
±

|

iﬁed hereafter. In this way one can then decide, at least in such a lowest-order

approximation, whether or not all three states

S = 1; Sz = 0,

are actually

|

1
±

i

degenerated in RST.

Our choice of lowest-order approximation simply consists in neglecting all the

interelectronic interactions, i.e. we put to zero the gauge potentials (a)A0(r, ϑ),
Aa(r, ϑ), B0(r, ϑ), β(r, ϑ) and ~B(~r). This results in a great simpliﬁcation of the pre-

ceding eigenvalue system (4.8)-(4.13b); namely the angular equations (4.9), (4.11),

(4.12b) and (4.13b) merely imply that the two-particle wave amplitudes R±, S±
˜R±(r), ˜S±(r),

become independent of the polar angle ϑ (i.e. R±(r, ϑ), S±(r, ϑ)

→

and furthermore the radial equations (4.8), (4.10), (4.12a) and (4.13a) are reduced

The solutions for these two decoupled one-particle conﬁgurations are well-known

in the literature (see, e.g. ref.

[21]) and may be parametrized by the principal

quantum numbers na (a = 1, 2) of both particles. For instance, the one-particle
mass eigenvalues ˜Ma are given by

˜Ma =

M

1 + (

zexαs

na−1+√1−(zexαs)2 )2

q

(na = 1, 2, 3, . . . )

(4.15)

Thus one can determine the approximate two-particle energy spectrum
( ˜ET (n1, n2), say) by taking the value of the exact energy functional ET (3.35) upon

the approximate solutions

of the reduced eigenvalue system (4.14a)-

(4.14d), yielding the desired energy spectrum in a lowest-order approximation.

Naturally one expects that, for such a rough estimate, it will also be suﬃcient

to resort to the linear approximation of the Poisson equations for the gauge po-

tentials, as speciﬁed by equations (3.34a)-3.34d). Using the standard boundary

Observe here that the non-relativistic limit (where the ”negative-energy” compo-

this exchange correction ∆E(h)

)
tegral ∆E(n,n

just coincides with the conventional exchange in-
(3.4). The wave amplitude ˜R+(r) ( ˜S+(r)) corresponds to the ﬁrst

(second) particle’s wave function ψ1(~r) (ψ2(~r)), up to the angular normalization

factor of (4π)−1/2 (4.3a)-(4.3b). Thus, as far as this lowest-order approximation is

concerned, RST is found to be in agreement with the Hartree-Fock approach, see

53

the discussion of the level shift of ortho-helium caused by the exchange interactions

in ﬁg.3.

Both energy corrections ∆E(e)

As expected, the ”orbital energy” TO vanishes for both particles

Summarizing, the RST conﬁgurations of deﬁnite spin direction

S = 1, Sz =

|

1 > are well-deﬁned now in their lowest-order approximation, namely through

±
their eigenvalue equations (4.14a)-(4.15), potentials (4.16a)-(4.16d) and energy
functional ˜ET (4.19). Therefore the question of their degeneracy with the states

S = 1, Sz = 0 > of indeﬁnite spin direction can be studied by explicitely working

|
out, as the next task, all the RST ﬁelds (especially the corresponding energy

functional) due to those curious states which have spin quantum number S = 1 but

vanishing z-component Sz = 0. Since we are satisﬁed here with a demonstration of

the degeneracy only in the lowest-order approximation, we can restrict ourselves

to showing that the approximate mass eigenvalue equations for the exotic states

Sz = 0 do agree with the present ones (4.14a)-(4.15), because in this case the
kinetic (T(aaa)) and interaction energies (M (... )
c2) entering the energy functional ˜ET

a

(4.19) are identical.

Indeﬁnite Spin Direction

S = 1; Sz = 0

|

The proposal for the exotic conﬁgurations with indeﬁnite spin direction consists

in disposing of the wave amplitudes (a)R±, (a)S±, due to the general ansatz (3.9)-

(3.10), in the following way:

Thus the Pauli spinors (a)φ±(~r) (3.9) become for the exotic states

(1)S+ = (1)S− = (2)S+ = (2)S− = 0

(1)R+ = R+(r, ϑ) ei ϕ/2

(1)R− = R−(r, ϑ) ei ϕ/2

(2)R+ = S+(r, ϑ) ei ϕ/2

(2)R− = S−(r, ϑ) ei ϕ/2 .

(4.25d)

(4.25e)

(4.26a)

(4.26b)

(4.26c)

(4.26d)

Here one assumes that the four wave amplitudes R±(r, ϑ), S±(r, ϑ) are unique,

complex-valued functions over three-space so that the corresponding Pauli-spinors

(a)φ± become ambiguous with respect to their sign:

(a)φ±(r, ϑ, ϕ + 2π) =

(a)φ±(r, ϑ, ϕ) ,

−

(4.27)

which is frequently the case for spinors, because they transform under SU(2) in

place of SO(3).

However the corresponding physical densities (as ”observables” of the theory)

must be real-valued and unique. Actually, inserting the present triplet ansatz

(4.25a)-(4.25e) into the electromagnetic currents (3.19)-(3.20c) yields ﬁrst for the

56

Similarly, the electromagnetic current becomes for the ﬁrst particle (a = 1)

charge densities of both particles the unique result

and for the second particle (a = 2)

whereas both currents ~ka(~r) have vanishing azimuthal component (a = 1, 2):

Thus the currents ~ka(~r) (3.17a) of the exotic states do not encircle the z-axis (as

the symmetry axis of the ﬁeld conﬁguration), but they build up a rotational ﬂow

in the two-planes containing the z-axis, see the introductory ﬁgure. A similar
geometric pattern does emerge also for the exchange current ~h(~r) (3.17b) which is

found to have vanishing azimuthal component (3.22c)

whereas the radial and longitudinal components (3.22a)-(3.22b) are obtained as

(4.34)

Concerning the functional form of the associated gauge ﬁelds, one will adapt this

again to the geometric pattern of the currents. Thus one puts to zero the azimuthal
components of the magnetic vector potentials ((a)Aϕ = Bϕ ≡
general forms (3.17c)-(3.17d) to

0) which reduces their

~Aa(~r) = (a)Ar~er + (a)Aϑ~eϑ

~B(~r) = Br~er + Bϑ~eϑ ,

(4.35a)

(4.35b)

with the components (a)Ar, (a)Aϑ, Br, Bϑ being functions exclusively of r and ϑ.

Clearly these components must now enter the mass eigenvalue equations for the

exotic spin states (Sz = 0) which are to be deduced again from the general form

(3.23)-(3.26d) by inserting there the present special form (4.25a)-(4.25e) of the

wave amplitudes. In this way, the mass eigenvalue equations for the ﬁrst particle

(a = 1) appear in the following form:

In order to close this system, the Poisson equations for the gauge potentials have

to be supplied; but since we are satisﬁed for the moment with the lowest-order

approximation, one can again resort to the linearized form (3.34a)-(3.34d). How-

ever, it is important to mention here that with the present shape of the magnetic

so that these states

|
magnetic moment, in contrast to the states

S = 1; Sz =

±

of this point in ref. [18]). Therefore only the latter states can provide a handle for

an external magnetic ﬁeld in order to shift the energy levels (in opposite directions)

whereas the energy of the exotic spin state

|

(Zeeman eﬀect [1]).

The fact that both ﬁeld conﬁgurations

have vanishing z-component of their total spin ~S lets expect that their geome-

V. SINGLET STRUCTURE

In order to see clearly both the diﬀerences and the common features of ortho-

and para-helium, it is most instructive to inspect the latter type of helium along

the lines of arguments being used for the preceding discussion of the triplet states.

Especially one is interested here in seeing the reason why the energy of the singlet

states (in lowest order) is not shifted by the exchange interactions in RST (and in

the Hartree-Fock approach), in contrast to the energy of the triplet states.

A. Singlet Fields

It seems self-suggestive that for the RST analogue of the conventional states

the general wave amplitudes (a)R±, (a)S± (3.8)- (3.10) the following ansatz:

the single-particle spins should be anti-parallel, i.e. one tries for

tion (3.34b), see the solution (4.16c). But when both objects h0 and B0 do vanish,
the exchange energy ˆza ·
the latter agrees (in lowest order of approximation) with the exchange correction
∆E(h)
T

(3.54) and therefore also with the conventional exchange energy ∆EC (3.4)

c2 (3.43a)-(3.43b) must vanish, too. However, since

M (h)
a

(see the discussion below equation (4.18)), one encounters here the origin of the

missing exchange energy in RST and in the HF approach!

Though both approaches lead to the same eﬀect of missing exchange energy for

para-helium, the interpretation is however diﬀerent:

(i) The conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics is of statistical nature

and therefore the missing of exchange energy ∆EC (3.4) is traced back to the non-

identity of electrons with diﬀerent z-components sz (=

1
2 ) of their spins (thus
escaping the Pauli principle). Such diﬀerent particles are described by the Hartree

±

approach, not the HF approach. As is well-known, the Hartree approximation

does not take into account the exchange eﬀects [1, 20].

(ii) In RST, the exchange forces are considered as being due to real gauge inter-

actions (similar to the electromagnetic interactions); and therefore the missing of

62

the (”electric”) exchange eﬀect is interpreted as being due to the missing of the

source for exciting the exchange potential B0.

Concerning the functional form of the gauge ﬁelds, this will be dictated again

by the present form of the associated currents. Thus, both electric para-currents
~k1(~r) (4.4a) and ~k2(~r) (5.3) will imply again the former shape (4.7a) of the vec-
tor potentials ~Aa(~r), but the ortho-form of the ”magnetic” exchange potentials
~B(~r) (4.7b) cannot be taken over to the present para-case. The reason is that the
exchange current ~h(~r) must adopt now its para-form as

with the complex-valued vector ﬁeld ~Wp(~r) being deﬁned through

~h(~r) = i h(r, ϑ)

~W ∗

p (~r) ,

·

~Wp(~r) =

eiϕ(~eϑ + i cos ϑ ~eϕ) ,

−

but with the strength of current h(r, ϑ) being formally the same as for the ortho-

case (4.6):

h(r, ϑ) =

R+ ·

S− + R− ·
4π

S+

.

Consequently, with reference to the Poisson equation (3.34d), one puts for the
para-form of the ”magnetic” exchange potential ~B:

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

~B(~r) = i r B

with a real-valued exchange amplitude B = B(r, ϑ).

B. Mass Eigenvalue Equations

After the functional forms of all the para-ﬁelds are known, one inserts these into

the general eigenvalue system (3.23)-(3.26d) and ﬁnds then the mass eigenvalue

Observe here that the angular part (5.11a)-(5.11b) of the present para-system

exactly agrees with the angular part (4.9) and (4.11) of the former ortho-system,

although the exchange potential Bµ(~r) looks rather diﬀerent for both cases, cf. the
ortho-potential ~B(~r) (4.7b) and its para-counterpart (5.9). However, in contrast

to the angular system, the radial equations do appear rather diﬀerent, despite the

fact that the ﬁrst particle (a = 1) has spin up in both cases; compare the ortho-

equations (4.8) and (4.10) to their present para-counterparts (5.10a)-(5.10b)!

As was mentioned already in connection with the general eigenvalue equations

in Sect.3, such a system must be completed by the Poisson equations for the

gauge potentials in order to have a closed system. However, for the present singlet

states 1S0 we are not satisﬁed with the linearized form of the Poisson equations

(3.34a)-(3.34d), but will apply their exact form [22] for our subsequent numerical

calculations.

C. Ortho/Para Level Splitting

For a discussion of the energy splitting between the present para-conﬁgurations

1S0 and the former ortho-conﬁgurations 3S1 of Sect.4, one will resort again to

the lowest-order approximation. To this end, one neglects all the interparti-

cle interactions for the para-eigenvalue system (5.10a)-(5.13b) and thus ﬁnds the

present system being reduced to the former approximative system (4.14a)-(4.14d)

which therefore represents a common approximation to both the ortho- and para-

conﬁgurations. However, both types of solutions are diﬀerent with respect to their
energy content ET , even for the lowest-order approximation ˜ET (4.19). The reason

is here that the present para-conﬁgurations have vanishing exchange density h0(~r),
cf. (5.4), and therefore the exchange energy ∆E(h)
T

(3.54) and (4.18) must nec-

essarily also vanish! Consequently, the para-levels do not receive a shift through

the exchange interactions, as is the case with the ortho-levels (see ﬁg.3 and the

66

discussion below equation (4.18)). A further consequence is the fact that the RST

(and HF) predictions for the energy diﬀerence between the singlet states 1S0 and
the triplet states 3S1 are (in lowest-order approximation) half the value of the pre-

dictions of the standard theory, which, on the other hand, are in good agreement

with the experiments; see the discussion of this point in ref. [18].

Does this mean that RST (as the relativistic generalization of the Hartree-Fock

approach) can be useful only for the computation of the triplet level systems but

becomes useless when one wants to consider the singlet levels? This question can

be decided only by concrete calculations of the frequency of spectral lines for the

transitions within the singlet level system 1S0 and comparison to the experimental

data. The point here is that the frequency of a spectral line is computed from an
ET(f in) due to the total energy ET (3.35) of the initial
energy diﬀerence ET(in) −
(in) and ﬁnal (f in) states; and it may well be that the inﬂuence of the (missing)
exchange energy ∆E(h)

T , as part of the total energy ET , cancels or at least is weak-
ened when forming that energy diﬀerence. For instance, a closer inspection of the

”semiclassical” (i.e. u = 0) RST prediction of the ground state (1s2 1S0) energy

ET has revealed that there is a deviation from the predictions of other theoretical

approaches [10, 11] by not more than 1, 3 eV in the range 2

zex ≤

≤

100, see

ref.[16]. Therefore one has to resort now to numerical calculations in order to

decide the question of precision within the singlet level system.

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS

For a numerical test of RST, one will ﬁrst consider a suﬃciently simple situation

for which the computational eﬀort remains moderate. In this respect, a consid-

erable complication of the preceding eigenvalue system is due to the fact that

the two-particle wave amplitudes R±, S± are functions of both polar coordinates

r, ϑ
}

{

which thus yields a two-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Therefore a pos-

67

sible simpliﬁcation can surely be attained by considering isotropic conﬁgurations

where the wave amplitudes

R±, S±}

{

and all the gauge ﬁelds

(a)A0, Aa, B

de-

{

}

pend exclusively upon the radial variable r. However such isotropic conﬁgurations

are possible as exact solutions only for the singlet states ns2 1S0 (Sect.V) where

the spins of both particles are antiparallel and their principal quantum numbers
do coincide (n1 = n2 + n). But in the general case (n1 6
(5.11a)-(5.11b) and (5.13a)-(5.13b) of the para-eigenvalue system demonstrate that

= n2), the angular parts

the wave amplitudes must be expected to depend also of the polar angle ϑ; unless

one can ﬁnd solutions for which the right-hand sides of those equations do vanish.

Obviously this requirement implies the following conditions:

which of course is deduced from the original system (5.10a)-(5.10b) by means of

Naturally, the assumption of isotropy will simplify also the (exact) energy func-

tional ET (3.35). The ﬁrst point to observe here refers to the normalization con-
ditions (3.32). Since the ”electric” exchange ﬁeld strength ~X(~r) (3.33a)-(3.33b) is

given quite generally in terms of potentials through [22]

(6.6)

this vector ﬁeld must vanish ( ~X(~r)

0) because both the exchange potential B0

and the electrostatic potential diﬀerence ∆0 (5.16) is zero due to the assumption
of isotropy for the singlet states ns2 1S0. Therefore both charge densities (a)k0(~r)
and (a)l0(~r) (3.33a)-(3.33b) do coincide and this puts the normalization parameter

ˆza (see below equation (3.40b)) to unity (ˆza = 1) for both particles (a = 1, 2):

B. Relativistic Energy Diﬀerence 2s2 1S0 / 1s2 1S0

Obviously the isotropic form of the RST eigenvalue problem is suﬃciently simple

in order to solve numerically the corresponding eigenvalue equations (6.4a)-(6.5b)

and to take the value of the exact energy functional E′′

T (6.10) upon these solutions.
This admits us to calculate, e.g., RST energy diﬀerences within the spectrum of

isotropic solutions and to compare this to both the experimental data and to the

analogous predictions of other theoretical approaches in the literature. As a simple
demonstration, we now inspect the energy diﬀerence of the states 2s2 1S0 (i.e.
n1 = n2 = 2) and 1s2 1S0 (i.e. n1 = n2 = 1), where the latter state is the ground-

state of the helium-like ions and has been studied already extensively [16]. The

energies to be considered refer to an idealized situation were the nucleus is thought

to be inﬁnitely heavy and the self-energy eﬀects (and other QED corrections) are

ﬁrst neglected (for the inclusion of self-energy in RST, see ref.s [15, 16]). Thus

denoting the semiclassical energy diﬀerence by ∆

E1\2, we have

(6.15)

where the energy functional to be used in RST is that one of the isotropic states

(6.10). This RST prediction may then be compared to the observational data

these experimental values ∆expE1\2 include the Lamb shift which in the present

83 when the RST self-interactions are adequately included. The RST

self-energy problem has been treated extensively in ref.s [15, 16] so that it may

be suﬃcient to reproduce here only the main results which are relevant for the

computation of the desired energy diﬀerence ∆RST E1\2:

Since this looks quite similar to the semiclassical result (6.15) without the self-

interactions, it is important to clearly state now the diﬀerences.

First let us mention that our RST self-interactions enter the theory via the

ﬁbre metric Kαβ (2.20). The general form of this ﬁbre metric is parametrized by

the ”self-interaction parameter” u : Kαβ = Kαβ(u); and this parameter enters

then also both the energy eigenvalue system and the energy functional ET (i.e.
ET (u)). However, for the presently considered isotropic solutions ns2 1S0,
ET ⇒
the change caused by a non-trivial value of u is minimal: First, the mass eigenvalue

system (6.4a)-(6.4b) remains invariant under a change of u. Next, it is easy to show

that also the electrostatic Poisson equation (6.5a) remains the same for a non-zero

value of u. Thus it is only the magnetostatic Poisson equation (6.5b) which changes

Thus it becomes evident, that the inclusion of the self-interactions implies for the

the purely electrostatic interactions.

≡

This eﬀect can be easily understood by recalling the speciﬁc way, in which

the self-interactions do appear in RST. First, reconsider the relationship (2.20a)-

(2.20b) between the Maxwell currents jα

µ and the RST currents jαµ . Obviously,

74

the link between both currents is given by the ﬁbre metric Kαβ which for the

present two-particle conﬁgurations adopts the following form [15] for non-trivial

self-interaction (u

Therefore the inclusion of the self-interactions (i.e. u

−

(6.27)

Clearly, when all the Maxwellian three-currents do vanish according to (6.26),

then all the magnetic potentials Aa(r) (6.2b) and B(r) (6.2c) are also zero as

required by the Maxwell equations (2.7b)-(2.7e).

Thus, the result is that for u

one ends up with a conﬁguration which

→ ∞

has been called ”electrostatic approximation” [24], because all the magnetostatic

ﬁelds have been neglected. Now it turns out that this is an exact solution,

namely for inclusion of the self-interactions, but with u

. However, the

→ ∞

more important point with this type of solution refers here to the magnitude of

the self-interactions.

It is true, for vanishing self-interactions (u = 0) the RST

predictions for the energy diﬀerences ∆RSTE1\2 come close to the experimental

values by less than 0, 3% (ﬁg.4); but when u is increased from zero to inﬁnity, the

amount of lowering of the energy ET is not suﬃcient in order to shift the RST

prediction ∆RSTE1\2 suﬃciently close to the experimental value ∆expE1\2 for small

and intermediate nuclear charge numbers zex (zex . 50, say). This is the same

eﬀect as was previously encountered in connection with the ionization energy of

the helium-like ions [16] where the value of the self-interaction parameter u had

to be ﬁxed for the ground-state 1s2 1S0 as u = 0.03052 in order that the RST

predictions meet with the observational data for the ionization energies in the

range zex & 50. However, for the smaller values of nuclear charge zex (. 50), such

an acceptable ﬁt of the RST parameter u in order to adapt the RST predictions

to the experimental data is not possible, neither for the ionization energies of ref.

[16] nor for the present energy diﬀerences ∆E1\2.

ﬁg.4

76

In order to present a numerical demonstration of this eﬀect, consider the nu-

clear charge number zex = 42, molybdenum (see table I). The two-particle ground-

state energy for u = 0 is found by numerical integration as

and the excited state 2s2 1S0 has energy

∆RSTE1\2 becomes larger (ﬁg.5) and therefore it becomes possible

for large enough zex to select a parameter value u2 such that the RST predic-

tion ∆RSTE1\2 (6.19) coincides with the (presently unknown) experimental value

∆expE1\2. A similar eﬀect occurs with the ground-state ionization energy [16], see

Of course, a rigorous proof of the claimed coincidence of the RST predictions

∆RSTE1\2 with the (missing) experimental data ∆expE1\2 of ref.[17] for large zex

is not possible, but a rough estimate may give nevertheless a ﬁrst hint upon the

correctness of that extrapolating claim. Observe here that the experimental one-

an overview of the corresponding RST predictions ∆RST E1\2 for u2 = u1 = 0.03052

E 1\2 are of the same magnitude (. 0, 2%) for large zex(& 40). This suggests to

adopt for the excited state 2s2 1S0 the same value for the self-interaction parameter u

0, 03052) as for the ground-state 1s2 1S0, see ref. [16].

Adopting the same value u = 0, 03052 for both the ground state 1s2 1S0 and the excited

state 2s2 1S0 yields the RST predictions for the energy diﬀerence ∆RST E1\2 (6.19) of these

states in the limit of large zex(& 40) where observational data are not yet available.

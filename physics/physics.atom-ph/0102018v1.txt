INTRODUCTION

At atom-ﬁeld interaction frequency-time splitting of a spectral line of spontaneous radi-

ation can occurs due to given the dressed atom theory at high intensity of external ﬁeld or

for explained splitting each of two energy atomics levels to some sublevels at low intensity of

external ﬁeld as a result of quantum interference eﬀect, as it was supposed and demonstrated

with help of 3D pictures titled as Probability-Time-Frequency (PTF) manifolds [1]. On the

other hand for such observable characteristics as the spontaneous radiation is possible to use

the transformation from trigonometrical functions of probability of a ﬁnding a particle at a

concrete energy level inside atom to the exponential characteristics in space outside of atom.

The rate of emission for the quantum transition depend on the derivative of probability P(τ )

The well known formula for the transition probability P(τ ) given in single frequency exci-

tation of the two level atom is:

Then the procedure of ﬁnding the rate of the power absorption leads to the correspondent

proﬁle:

R1 =

At a denominator of the formula there are three members, one of which can be incorpo-

rated with other of two stayed members. In this case this formula can be compared with a

standard structure of Lorentz proﬁle, at which denominator always there are only two mem-

bers. Therefore communication of two spaces both the atomic and the external are carried

out except the amplitude in unique parameter known as a full width on half of maximum

(FWHM) of spectral line measured in a scale of frequencies or time. This FWHM for a

Lorentz proﬁle is designated as (2γ). The connection between this size of FWHM and a

damping constant of oscillator same designated, but describing losses of energy of a particle

at interaction with other particles in environment is especially brightly shown for wide of

FWHM spectral lines due to collisions with other atoms. It is much more diﬃcult to ex-

plain such connection between FWHM and (2 γ) for isolated oscillator or for radiation from

stopped atom by laser cooling. Despite of it isolated oscillator has spontaneous radiation

and therefore is characterized by so-called natural width of a spectral line connected with

the same (2 γ) as the damping constant from classical equation of oscillator. It is possible to

tell that it is one of diﬃcult examples when the classical performances need to be combined

with the quantum, if to mean that the energy level can be split as in the dressed theory. If

such splitting is not connected to a magnetic ﬁeld, therefore does not exist rules of selection

for optical transitions and then there is a question about that occurs with a particle on line

interacted with EM ﬁeld if it is with identical probability at diﬀerent energy statuses of sub

levels. The time of spontaneous emission tS from upper energy level is well known:

The probability that an electron with life, having unknown time (t), will leave the upper

energy level, and its spontaneous radiation will fade with known constant (γ−1

S ) is deﬁned

by function

The probability that the upper level will become empty with a known damping constant (γ)

during the unknown time of spontaneous radiation (tS ) is:

At deﬁnition of complete probability of time of life it is necessary to take into account both

probabilities [1]

The lifetime t going from function G2 is oversized the lifetime tL = 2ts from the ﬁrst

atom.

Other classical example is under consideration of the phase and group speed of the waves

interaction with a separated atom, because for only one wave of an external EM ﬁeld, as

against a single pulse mode or mode of several EM waves, the group speed of the single

wave exist only as a mathematics value and therefore does not inﬂuence on phase speed, if

of course is to consider reception of a single external wave from single external oscillator.

It is well known that the dispersion of an index of refraction n(ω) named as the abnormal

refraction is in a vicinity of resonant frequency (ω0) at interaction of an electromagnetic wave

On the other hand such single wave can be submitted from external space as a set waves

and then the physical sense for application of group speed is kept for single wave. However

it is possible to assume and return situation, when single external wave cooperates with set

of particles having for example a parallel trajectories.

I. WHETHER THERE IS A PROBLEM OF AN ELECTRONS TRAJECTORY IN

ATOM?

Last example can be served by application of mutual orientation of a trajectory of a

particle and ﬁeld. Because the phase speed (vf ) depends on (ω

ω0), therefore, in particular,

−

for two separated EM waves with frequencies detuned symmetrical respect to the central

frequency of quantum transition in atom, named as sidebands modes of EM ﬁeld, as known,

that is possible to supply diﬀerent phase speeds of EM waves in same environment.

Is

possible spatially to divide these waves and to direct them towards each other. So, the atom

placed in such ﬁeld, will test action of diﬀerent forces f1 ,2 = dp/dt, where p = m

dx /dt,

·

where (m) is the mass of the particle,(x ) is the displacement of the atom along the EM ﬁeld.

When an atom is under perturbation of two symmetrical and coherent laser frequencies [1],

therefore the frequency detuning conditions for such bichromate laser waves are:

E(τ ) = E0 [cos(ω1τ ) + cos(ω2τ )]

For the special perturbation of the upper energy level there are two symmetrical frequencies

and we can use the relation:

The transition probability is:

With Bessel functions the probability P2 can be written:

P2 = [2J1(ρ) sin ∆ωτ + 2J3(ρ) sin 3∆ωτ + 2J5(ρ) sin 5∆ωτ + ..]2

Thus the trajectory of an atom plays the important role, because the atom can be stopped

by sidebands method that results in known now results on cooling atoms. Contrary an atom

can be accelerated.

Let us note, that is interesting to consider the problem of the movement of an electron

within atom with the trajectory along and against a direction of a wave vector of the EM ﬁeld,

because with the rotation inside atom the electron can additional braking or acceleration.

So both the trajectory of electrons within atom especially in a case of quantum transition

and spatial orientation of a ﬁeld inside atom are important too. In this work it is oﬀered to

discuss only some of these problems due to this question is connected with the important

presence of a damping coeﬃcient (γ) in equation of the oscillator and because such modes

of movement should be shown in radiation of a driven charge.

The quantum mechanics does not recognize exact deﬁnition of coordinates or trajectory of

movement. If the force in classical physics is deﬁned as f = dp/dt, in the quantum mechanics

it is (F =

∂U /∂t), where (U ) represents known potential. At the same time potential

−

depends on coordinate (x), which by virtue of known uncertainty relation in the quantum

mechanics cannot be deﬁned. However, a wave function (ψ) in the quantum mechanics

describes wave with not observable characteristics as the ”wave frequency” (H /¯h) and is

presented through the operators of coordinate (X ) and moment (Λ), because the hamiltonian

The information about space of an atom can be received only in space of classical physics

oscillator the exam of the diﬀerential equation gives inﬁnite on size value of displacement

Therefore it is obvious, that it is simultaneously impossible to simulate both conditions

(ω = ω0) and (γ = 0). Despite of it, it is possible to explain increase of displacement up to

inﬁnite size by display of the appeared acceleration. Really, the well known equation of a

mechanisms for one connected electron. When the frequency of a ﬁeld comes nearer to

resonant frequency, then in this vicinity of frequencies or in the appropriate vicinity of time

in system necessarily there should be an the damping, diﬀerently irrespective of energy of

an electromagnetic ﬁeld oscillations will simply be stopped when the electron becomes free,

because increase of displacement up to inﬁnite size.

Therefore there is a vicinity of time, when there are processes with several types of

the damping mechanisms braking the electron. From known observable processes of these

mechanisms, connected to presence, ﬁrst of all, it is necessary to allocate the absorption

and both spontaneous and compelled radiation. The important problem for one atom is the

understanding of a nature of the spontaneous radiation damping constant. This problem

concerns to a question on so-called optical friction and is general for the classical and quan-

tum approach, as is connected that the damping is present at processes, which are not for

separately taken atom, because there is no interaction with environment.

In the quantum mechanics the damping (γ) is entered in the equations provided that

the electron already is at the exited level, and the ﬁeld at this moment has no energy or is

switched simply oﬀ like a case for a short pulse of a EM ﬁeld. The presence of the damping

is entered in the assumption, that probability of a ﬁnding atom in the exited status is . In

case of unlimited quantity of oscillators, the system of the equations results for complete

probability of spontaneous transition from the exited status

[2]. Thus the damping has

the imaginary part and gives the amendment on displacement of own frequency, neglecting

quantum.

The important note is about the time as the complex number, which has not only size

opposite to the frequency of an external ﬁeld, but also size, opposite to the complex damping

The connection between a spectral contour for probability and its FWHM is determined

as well as by Lorentz function with inknown value of the amplitude:

Therefore any quantum process observable in space of laboratory and described by the

formula passes through a number (q

= n0 ), where (n0 ) is the main quantum number of

discrete energy levels. Consequently the picture of energy levels distribution in the space

of laboratory should correspond to this picture. It is possible to try to show importance

of distinction of performances about the main quantum number in diﬀerent spaces on the

following example which is connected with classical parameter of refraction.

The direct transition from consideration of one atom to consideration of environment

consisting many (N ) atoms and back requires a physical explanation of applicability for

separated atom (N = 1 ) not only concept of the damping constant, but also such concepts

as a parameter of refraction (n) or permeability (ǫ). As is known, the polarization of

environment (P) is deﬁned by the dipole moment (d = e

x ). On the other hand, the

polarization is deﬁned by a susceptibility (α) and electrical component of an electromagnetic

ﬁeld (E ):

(35)

(36)

(37)

However permeability (ǫ) and parameter of refraction (n) can not be simply transferred from

space of environment into the space of separate atom. In this work is possible to assume,

that there are features of structure of atom, which are shown that the connected electron

in atom and the free electron in space of laboratory are the same particle which are taking

place in diﬀerent spaces. Therefore they can have diﬀerences in such characteristics, as a

charge (e) and the mass (m), because they have diﬀerences on dynamics of the movement

10

driven by EM ﬁeld. The space of separate atom can have especial structure, in which the

mass and the charges of the connected electron interacted with a EM ﬁeld diﬀer among

themselves. Thus connected electrons with a negative charge in diﬀerent atoms are con-

sidered taking place in diﬀerent spaces, and free electrons with a negative charge leaving

of energy limits of diﬀerent atoms in space of laboratory are considered identical (standard

electron). The change of particles mass (m) during movement should result in the certain

conformity between complete energy of a particle and energy of the appropriate quantum

transition. It is natural to assume, that the electromagnetic wave crosses set of spaces with

diﬀerent phase speed in each of them. Let’s name as resonant spaces such spaces, which are

connected among themselves by any interaction to occurrence of a particle or information

electromagnetic ﬁeld. As an information electromagnetic ﬁeld we shall name such electro-

magnetic ﬁeld, which satisﬁes with the Maxwell equations and bears in the characteristics

the information on investigated space. Let’s assume, that the resonant spaces having, at

least, linear communication between one vector in one space with other vectors in the other

space cooperate only. Let’s assume, that the birth of an electromagnetic ﬁeld occurs on bor-

der of resonant spaces. The communication of two linear spaces of laboratory and atom is

carried out by conformity between dependence of amplitude of a ﬁeld on time and frequency

in one space and in the another space with dependence of probability of ﬁnding electron at a

energy level from time and frequency. Factor of proportionality deﬁnes a time scale in each

space, i.e. the frequency of a EM ﬁeld (ω) and Rabi frequency (Ω):

where the dipole matrix element is (d12 = e

x12 ). It is possible to assume, that the vectors

·
(~d ) and (~x ) characterize the space not as linearly dependent pair vectors, and as linear -

independent pair vectors, therefore is possible to write down:

Thus, the charge (e) of the connected electron is a vector (~e). This vector has projections to

the allocated directions and, hence, brings in charging symmetry to space of atom. Therefore,

the application of the classical physical characteristics such as (n), (ǫ) for separate atom is

possible.

Assuming, that trajectory of an electron with speed (V ) is the circle, in which centre is

nucleus, is necessary to return to a hypothesis of Bohr and De Brogle. On one orbit with

length (2 πR), where radius (R) is deﬁned by:

(40)

is possible to lay an integer of lengths of waves (λ

One can to observe that the charge has the same vector nature that the velocity. Let’s copy

the formula in view of a known ratio (λ

·

speed of light (c0 ) is connected to phase speed of electrons wave through (c0 = vf

n), where

·
Thus, the parameter of refraction (n) of an atom should be discrete size due to the main

quantum number.

Let’s return to the decision of the classical equation of oscillator. It is possible to notice

what exactly from here follows, that the permeability (ǫ) is complex number. For this reason

the parameter of refraction (n = √ǫ) is deﬁned by a root of the second degree from complex

number. However parameter of refraction deﬁnes a phase speed of an electrons wave. It

is easy to show, that this phase speed is split on two waves distinguished on a phase on

number (π). This implies, that the main quantum number (n0 ) also can result in processes

with the same phase displacement.

12

In physics some cases are known, when the diﬀerence of phases is equal to (π). First it

is shown at reﬂection of a EM wave. Secondly it is possible to search for such diﬀerence in

phases at display of linear polarization of a wave. In third, such diﬀerence exists between

positive and negative parts of periodic sine wave function.

II. POSSIBLE PAIR PROCESSES FOR WAVES AND PARTICLES

Let’s consider as an example probable reaction of an atom space to action of an external

ﬁeld. For this purpose we shall lead analogy between space of an optical crystal and the two

levels atom. Let external ﬁeld has given, for example, ordinary linear polarization named

as a (o) -wave, which in turn, as is known, can be submitted consisting from both the right

and the left rotating vectors of polarization. Such two vectors, opposite on rotation can

be considered, as two waves having the identical module and arguments distinguished on

number π. On an entrance of a crystal such external (o)-ﬁeld is usually represented as two

identical (o)-waves having identical frequency ω and two identical amplitudes. Actually

by such consideration the one wave goes about two waves having the identical module and

diﬀerent arguments. As a result of interaction, a unusual (e)-wave with the polarization

revolved on corner of 90 degrees is left the crystal. As is known, there is such spatial

direction inside a crystal, in which the so-called (oo

e) interaction results in identical

−

factors of a parameter of refraction n0 (ω) = ne(2 ω) on the frequency ω for (o)- wave and

on the frequency 2ω for (e) -wave for known procedure of the second harmonic generation

(SHG). Both ﬁelds are external in relation to space of a crystal, as their characteristics are

measured in space of classical physics named as a space of laboratory. Thus, the phase

synchronism of speeds vf = c0 /n is a reaction of interaction of two spaces.

In gas environment of atoms the reaction of interaction both spaces the laboratory space

and the space of atoms shown as similar SHG of 2ω should not essentially diﬀer from reaction

by the space of a crystal. Near to a line of absorption always there is an opportunity of

a choice of two frequencies with an identical parameter of refraction due to the known

13

abnormal dependence of the refraction parameter. In the speciﬁc case frequencies can be

multiple, as SHG, but the square-law dependence for low intensity external EM ﬁeld of SHG

intensity completely not necessarily should be observed. Thus it is necessary to distinguish,

that at such low intencities the SHG in atomic environment diﬀers from known process of the

two photon absorption within an atom with the subsequent radiation. Generally is possible

to think that at high intencities the multi photons generation of radiation diﬀers from multi

photons of absorption with the subsequent radiation, because can occur at conditions when

the determining factor is the dependence n(ω) near to a line of resonant absorption.

External in relation to atom and periodically time-dependent electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld

E = Eo cos ω

t in space of laboratory is usually represented as analytical continuation of

function valid variable (ω

t) in complex area. In this work is paid attention to some features

·

·

of such transition in a complex plane and back from the point of view of interpretation of

physics of model connected to generation of an electromagnetic ﬁeld.

When on some given piece [a, b], where a = ω1 t1 and b = ω2 t2 of the valid real axis

chosen along any direction of the space, that for length [a, b], included in complex area,

there is a unique function of the complex variable z = a + ı

From the mathematical point of view on deﬁnition of complex numbers follows, that one

It is understandable, that interpretation of diﬀerent marks of arguments of a ﬁeld can serve

performance about two vectors directed along the allocated direction of a numerical axis in

opposite directions and distinguished on a corner equal π.

It is known, that the loss of energy of an external ﬁeld communicates, for example,

with such eﬀects, as eﬀect of saturation in two-level atom (N1 = N2 ) or with other known

nonlinear eﬀects occurring to a plenty connected electrons in diﬀerent atoms at a large

intensity of the external ﬁeld. At the same time, in separately taken atom connected electron

increases the energy only for the account (¯hω). Therefore according to the quantum theory

for excite separately taken oscillator it is enough to have vaguely weak on intensity external

EM ﬁeld.

Actually a threshold condition should exist as a ratio between losses of the electron on

radiation γR and losses of a ﬁeld on absorption γA. At such understanding of processes

the connected electron always radiates, including at the moment of transition to the exited

energy level. For example, considering one-dimensional classical oscillator at the included

external ﬁeld, according to the theory of Einstein, it is necessary to exam processes of

absorption, and also processes of the compelled and spontaneous radiation. These processes

are characterized in known coeﬃcients A21 ,B21 and B12 . In this connection, it is possible

to write down the balance equation for various damping constants of classical oscillator,

because the damping constant of spontaneous radiation γS is equal to A21 :

the equation of the oscillator. Therefore becomes obvious, that the time of life should not

be equaled of time spontaneous radiation γ−1
S .

If there is an absorption of energy of EM ﬁeld in space of atom, this implies classical

performance that the external ﬁeld should cross a surface of atom under the laws by and

large connected with the known laws of Fresnel for environments. Visible light absorbed by

the majority of known atoms, does not test of diﬀraction on such small on the sizes object

as atom. However, for shorter lengths of waves or for atoms with the large sizes occurring

processes of reﬂection and (or) the absorption would result in occurrence of a diﬀraction

shadow from atom. As the sizes of atom are small in comparison with length of a EM wave,

such sizes allow to make transition to a limiting case of disappearance of objects in classical

diﬀraction tasks, when the external ﬁeld can be submitted on a complex plane as a spiral,

including in a limiting case with a resulting vector along an imaginary axis. Agreeing with

application of a known principle of Optics it is possible to assume, that the separate atom

is a source of secondary waves. Apparently, the secondary waves in interpretation of this

principle simply should mean the fact of an output from atom of pair waves with a diﬀerence

of phases distinguished on number π.

The EM wave can be presented as a continuous analytical function f (z ) of complex

variable z = x + ı

y with ˙f

= 0, through partial derivative of functions (u) and (v ):

f (z ) = u(x , y) + ı

The continuity of function is carried out during each period, when there are limiting values

complex variable can be presented as two functions valid variable (u) and (v ).

For presentation it is possible to consider possible interpretation of occurrence of a usual

periodic wave with constant amplitude E = Eo

sin(ωt). Such recording for both electrical

·

components of a ﬁeld means that at increase of size of product of frequency at time there

is an increase of a corner between these components of a ﬁeld. Here analogy to periodic

movement on a circle for a particle having an electrical charge ﬁrst of all is pertinent. In

this case it is possible to speak that between the center of a circle where there is a positively

charged nucleus and the particle with a negative charge exists electromagnetic interaction

resulting to such movement. For a wave with a wave vector k = ω/c, where c is a speed of

light, such periodic decision corresponds to the wave equation

If the particle is at ﬁxed energy level, its trajectory can be connected to a trajectory of other

pair particles taking place on other energies levels of the same atom. There is an example

for a particle ﬁxed on a circle with a radius (a) and driven together with a circle along the

allocated direction (x ) in space of an atom in a plane (x , y) with a parameter (T ) of the

corner of turn acts:

It is known, that such trajectory is a projection of movement on a spiral. Radius of curvature

monotonously changes in conformity with a sine function:

double frequency of a wave. It is possible, that Radius of curvature ρ of this trajectory for

pair ﬁelds is variable size and can corresponds to amplitude (E ) of EM wave, the radius

of the circle (a) can corresponds to (E0 ), the corner T can corresponds to ωt. For pair

particles it is possible to connect these characteristics with the Rabi frequency.

In each point such curve radius of curvature is perpendicular trajectories and all together

such radiuses form other curve, of what it is possible to be convinced if to replace T = τ

π.

This will be the same trajectory, but with other coordinates:

Therefore it is possible to assume, that there is one more ﬁeld or particle carrying out the

same movement with the same frequency and time, but taking place on other circle with

same radius. The trajectories of these pair processes will be moved with a phase diﬀerence

on number (π) and together they will correspond to one function with variable on a mark by

amplitude. Such movement for a particle can be simulated as movement at a ﬁxed energy

level with friction (γ), which is present at the equations of classical and quantum oscillators.

Continuing this logic it is possible to enter other parallel trajectories for charges of particles

and it is possible to investigate new EM processes.

In connection with the proposed model is possible to approve, that if the order of following

functions in investigated physical process is established to within a constant diﬀerence of

the phase, thus is established possibility to observe a pair physical processes for waves and

particles not only at space of the atom or the space of laboratory, but for diﬀerent spaces

18

where the ﬂat part of space in general probably may be divided on inverse sub spaces with

in parallel current direct and return processes.

Probably here there should be balanced restrictions on imagination, because it is possible

too to assume, that the physical laws containing mathematical functions from even degrees

of the arguments should correspond to pair processes and particles ”koquark”.

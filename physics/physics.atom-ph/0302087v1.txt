Abstract

The collisional electron-impact line widths of the 3s − 3p transitions in Li-like ions

from B III to Ne VIII are calculated with the convergent close-coupling (CCC)

method from the atomic collision theory. The elastic and inelastic contributions to

the line broadening and their Z-scaling are discussed in detail, and comparisons with

recent experimental and theoretical results are also presented. It is found that similar

to our previous study of line broadening in Be-like ions, the diﬀerence between

experimental and CCC results monotonically increases with the spectroscopic charge

of an ion.

1 Introduction

The broadening of spectral lines in dense plasmas primarily stems from a com-

plex interaction of an emitting atom with the perturbing plasma constituents

[1]. Accordingly, the line shapes and shifts reveal (generally non-trivial) de-

pendence on major plasma characteristics such as particle density and tem-

perature, and hence can serve as important diagnostic tools. The complexity

of the interaction, however, often impedes a reliable understanding of the line

broadening, both experimentally and theoretically.

Although the line widths in hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions can normally be

explained to a high level of accuracy, the recent studies on collisional broaden-

ing of isolated lines of multiply-charged ions have unveiled worrying disagree-

ment between the experimental data and various theoretical calculations, in-

cluding the advanced quantum-mechanical ones . An example is provided by

the resonance 2s − 2p line in the B III ion for which the experimental width

[2] was found to be about a factor of two larger than non-perturbative results

of both quantal and semiclassical [3,4]. As for the 2s3s − 2s3p singlet and

triplet lines in Be-like ions from boron to neon, it was shown that although

the quantal results agree well with experimental line widths for low-charge

ions, the deviation between experiment and theory monotonically increases

along the isoelectronic sequence [5,6], reaching a factor of two for Ne VII.

Such disagreement is indeed disturbing since the collisional broadening of the

isolated lines in multiply-charged ions is primarily determined by the inelastic

binary collisions, which in turn can be either experimentally assessed (as was

done for the B III 2s − 2p excitation cross section [7]) or reliably cross-checked

by comparing with other theoretical calculations.

2

A reliable measurement of rather narrow line widths in multiply-charged ions

poses demanding requirements both on the generation of the plasma proper-

ties required and the methods for an independent determination of electron

density Ne and temperature Te. In such benchmark experiments the laboratory

plasmas, or plasma volumes, that are used in line broadening measurements

have to be as uniform and stationary as possible and, if at all possible, to

be free of various instabilities and turbulences. Needless to say, these require-

ments are not easily met in laboratory plasmas and are diﬃcult to verify in

astrophysical plasmas. Moreover, an independent measurement of Ne and Te

requires the most accurate available techniques which may not be applicable

in some plasma conditions. It is thus not surprising that systematic measure-

ments of broadening of isolated lines in multiply-charged ions were primarily

conducted by two groups, namely, at the Institute of Physics in Belgrade, Yu-

goslavia, and at the Ruhr Universit¨at in Bochum, Germany. Both groups have

recently reported measurements of the 3s − 3p line widths in Li-like ions from

boron to oxygen (using a linear arc [8]) and from carbon to neon (using a

gas-puﬀ Z-pinch [9,10,11]), respectively, and the major plasma characteristics

were independently measured for each shot. Furthermore, several other exper-

imental results as well as a number of theoretical calculations are available for

these transitions. Thus, the existing data could when taken as a whole provide

a diverse set of results for comparison of measurements and theory.

In continuation of the previous quantal calculations of line broadening in

multiply-charged ions [3,5,6], we present here a quantum-mechanical calcu-

lation of the electron-impact line widths of the 3s − 3p transitions in Li-like

ions from B III to Ne VIII. The paper is organized as follows. Section II

contains the basic discussion of the theoretical method used for the present

3

calculation. The convergent close-coupling method is applied for determina-

tion of both inelastic and elastic contributions to the line widths. The results

of calculations as well as the comparison with experimental data are presented

in Sec. III. The following Section deals with the scaling properties of the line

widths and ﬁnally the conclusions are drawn in the last Section.

2 Theory

The calculational method implemented in the present work has been described

in detail previously (see, e.g., Ref. [6] and references therein), and hence only

the principal steps in the line width calculation are outlined here. The electron-

impact full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of an isolated spectral line is

calculated here using the Baranger formula [12], which represents the line

width as a product of the electron density Ne and the sum of the thermally-

averaged (i) inelastic (excitation, deexcitation, ionization, etc.) cross sections

for all possible collisional transitions from the upper and lower levels of the

radiative transition in question, and (ii) the diﬀerence squared of the non-

Coulomb elastic amplitudes fu and fl of scattering from the upper and lower

levels. This representation allows one to eﬃciently apply the computational

methods developed for a general atomic collision theory to calculations of the

impact line widths.

In this work both inelastic cross sections and elastic amplitudes are calculated

with the convergent close-coupling (CCC) method [13], which is presently

considered to be one of the most accurate techniques for electron-ion scattering

problems. A detailed description of the method as well as recent applications

of the CCC technique can be found in the review of Bray et al [14] and

4

references therein. We only mention here that the basic idea of this method is

the discretization of the continuum along with the use of the square-integrable

Laguerre basis, which signiﬁcantly facilitates the computational eﬀorts.

It is well known that in multiply-charged ions the major contribution to the

line width originates from excitation and deexcitation, and therefore a reliable

estimate of the cross section accuracy would be important for an assessment

of the line width accuracy. Since the existing experimental techniques do not

allow one to measure the cross sections for transitions between excited states

due to their small lifetimes, a comparison of diﬀerent theoretical results seems

presently to be the only tool for the error estimates. Fortunately, the Li-

like ions represent a simple quasi-one-electron atomic system with practically

pure LS-coupling for the lowest excited states (including the n = 3 terms), so

that one would expect the modern calculational techniques to produce fairly

accurate results for the collisional cross sections and amplitudes. Indeed, it

was conﬁrmed in a number of publications that the CCC excitation cross

sections agree well with both the experimental data and other theoretical

non-perturbative results for the ground state excitations. Such comparisons

were done, e.g., for the R-matrix with pseudostates and K-matrix method

results [15,16,17]. For higher-Z ions (Z ≥ 4), a detailed comparison of all ex-

citation cross sections between the states with the principal quantum number

n ≤ 4 has shown that the CCC data practically coincide with the perturba-

tive Coulomb-Born-exchange calculations [18]. Furthermore, a recent paper on

electron-impact excitation in Be II and B III (also including the transitions

between the excited states up to n ≤ 4) again demonstrated a high level of

agreement between the CCC and the K-matrix cross sections [17]. Thus, the

available data comparisons indicate that the CCC method seems to provide

5

high accuracy for the excitation cross sections of Li-like ions and, correspond-

ingly, for the inelastic contributions to the collisional line broadening. Also, it

has to be added that, as one would expect, for all ions considered here the ma-

jor contribution to the inelastic part comes from the collisional dipole-allowed

3s → 3p, 3p → 3s and 3p → 3d channels that amount to about 90% of the in-

elastic line width. The contribution of ionization and recombination channels

was found to be negligible compared to (de)excitation processes.

The accuracy of the theoretical elastic contribution to the line widths still

remains largely unknown. The main reason is that the elastic non-Coulomb

scattering amplitudes as well as the angular-integrated elastic diﬀerence term

(EDT) σEDT (E) ≡ R |fu (θ) − fl (θ)|

dΩ are practically unavailable in the lit-

2

erature. However, given the high accuracy of the CCC inelastic cross sections,

one would expect about the same accuracy for the elastic part as well. The

EDT’s for all ions from B III to Ne VIII have been calculated in the present

work (see the Z-scaled results in Sect. 4). It was found that while the elastic

cross sections σs,p (E) ≡ R |fs,p (θ)|2 dΩ follow the 1/E law for practically all

energies from 0.1 to 100 eV, the EDTs show a sharper fall σEDT (E) ∼ 1/Eα

with α = 1.35 ÷ 1.45, thereby pointing out a strong cancellation in the dif-

ference of elastic amplitudes. This steeper dependence on electron energy had

already been noticed in our previous studies on the B III 2s − 2p line and

Be-like 2s3s − 2s3p transitions [3,6].

3 Results and comparisons

The calculated elastic, inelastic and total FWHMs (in units of ˚A) for the

electron density of 1018 cm−3 vs. electron temperature Te in the range of Te

6

= 2 − 20 eV are presented in Table I for the ions from B III to F VII and

in the range of Te = 2 − 50 eV for Ne VIII, where experimental data are

available for higher Te. The inelastic contribution is seen to dominate over the

elastic part for all calculated temperatures, although for small Te = 2 eV the

relative contribution of the elastic line width reaches as much as 50% for N V

and O VI.The Te-scaling of the calculated line widths for Te = 2 − 20 eV is

approximately given as

λ ∝ T −α

,

e

(1)

where α takes values of 0.17 (B III), 0.29 (C IV), 0.28 (N V), 0.31 for O VI,

0.26 (F VII) and 0.23 (Ne VIII). These values show a weaker than the 1/T 0.5

e

dependence which is often used in the literature.

Figures 1-6 present the calculated CCC line widths and the available experi-

mental and theoretical data scaled to the electron density of Ne = 1018 cm−3.

Most of the other theoretical results are taken from Ref. [8]. Below we often

make use of the following designations: DSB – semiclassical results by Dim-

itrijevi´c and Sahal-Brechot as cited in Ref. [8], DK – calculations made within

the modiﬁed semiempirical method by Dimitrijevi´c and Konjevi´c as cited in

Ref. [8], HB – semiclassical results by Hey and Breger [19], MNPSC – modiﬁed

non-perturbative semiclassical method by Alexiou [20].

Note also that the measurements by the Belgrade group were carried out for

low densities Ne = (0.3 ÷ 1.4) × 1017 cm−3, while the Bochum group mea-

surements were performed on a linear gas-puﬀ Z-pinch at densities exceeding

1018 cm−3. The experimental error bars shown on the plots do not include the

uncertainty of electron density measurements which can be as high as 15%.

7

We now discuss the calculations for individual ions in more detail.

3.1 B III (Fig. 1)

For this ion, the 3s − 3p line width was measured only by the Belgrade group

[8]. The typical experimental electron densities and temperatures were about

1017 cm−3 and 5 eV, respectively. This is the only case where the present

CCC results practically coincide with the experimental data. Similarly, for

the Be-like ions [6] an agreement was found only for the lowest-charge ion

of B II. The semiclassical results of Griem and DSB, as cited in Ref. [8],

exceed the experimental data by about 70 and 40%, respectively, while the

semiempirical data of DK are seen to be within the errors bars, exceeding the

CCC line widths by 15-20% over the temperature interval Te = 2 − 20 eV.

The only other quantum-mechanical results, by Seaton [21], also conﬁrm the

experimental data near Te = 5.5 − 6 eV and, moreover, agree with the present

calculations to within 10% over a wider range of Te. Yet such good agreement

for low temperatures may not be a measure of good agreement of elastic parts

since the present calculations show that even for Te as low as 2 eV the elastic

contribution is only about one-ﬁfth of the total line width (see Table I).

3.2 C IV (Fig. 2)

The theoretical and experimental data for the C IV 3s−3p line width are quite

extensive. The older measurements by Bogen [22] and by El-Farra and Hughes

[23] are well conﬁrmed by the recent results of the Belgrade group [8]. The

gas-puﬀ Z-pinch data from Ref. [9], although being somewhat higher than the

8

extrapolated Te-trend from other measurements, nevertheless overlap with the

error bars from the Belgrade results. The recent measurements of Sreckovi´c et

al. [24] on a linear low-pressure pulsed arc were performed for low temperatures

Te ∼ 2 eV and showed a signiﬁcant spread. As for the theoretical results,

Seaton [21] carried out a quantum-mechanical R-matrix calculation within

the framework of the Opacity Project for this line width taking into account

the perturbing n = 2 and n = 3 states. Later Burke [25] improved Seaton’s

calculations using the same method but adding n = 4 states, which resulted

in a moderate increase of less than 10% to the line widths. The present CCC

results are seen to agree excellently with Burke’s calculations, particularly for

higher temperatures where the inelastic contribution dominates. Even for the

lowest temperatures (Te ∼ 4 eV) the diﬀerence is well within 10%. However,

as can be seen from Fig. 2, the recent experimental results [8,9] exceed the

CCC line widths by up to 30%.

3.3 N V (Fig. 3)

Experimental line widths for N V are available from both Bochum and Bel-

grade experiments, the former having rather large error bars for the electron

temperature. Of the available theoretical results, the semiclassical method

of Griem [1] provides very good agreement with both sets of experimental

data over the range of temperatures from 6 to 24 eV. It is noted that the

Te−dependence of line widths is very similar for the CCC, Griem and DK

results, while the semiclassical DSB data seem to decay faster for higher Te.

9

3.4 O VI (Fig. 4)

The available measurements for this ion were carried out over a rather large

range of electron temperatures, Te = 5 − 18 eV, although the error bars here

are quite signiﬁcant, and therefore it is diﬃcult to reach conclusions regarding

the temperature dependence of the data. Figure 4 shows that both sets of

experimental data for O VI well agree with the semiclassical calculations of

DSB. The only other quantum-mechanical data of Seaton for Te ≈ 11 eV

practically coincide with the present calculations, and the DK results are again

within 20% from the CCC data. The semiclassical results by Griem, Hey and

Breger, and Alexiou agree with each other and are at the lower edge of the

experimental error bars.

3.5 F VII (Fig. 5)

the experiment.

3.6 Ne VIII (Fig. 6)

The only available experimental data for this line for Te = 14 − 18 eV and

electron densities in the range (1.5 −3) ×1018 cm−3 were reported in Ref. [10].

Again, similar to the O VI case, the agreement with the semiclassical results

of DSB is very good, while all other theoretical results are much lower than

This is the case where the diﬀerence between the experiment and all existing

theoretical results is the largest. The broadening of the Ne VIII 3s − 3p line

at the highest electron temperatures of 30 and 42 eV was measured by the

10

Bochum group a decade ago [9,10] and has recently been remeasured on the

same experimental setup [11]. The latest data are seen to be closer to the

theoretical values (Fig. 6), so that DSB and Griem’s results are at the lower

edge of the error bars. However, the other available theoretical data are much

lower, and the disagreement with the experiment exceeds 50% for the MNPSC

method, DK and HB results, while the CCC line widths are factor 2.3 smaller

than the data from Ref. [11].

4 Discussion and Scaling Properties

As has already been mentioned in the Introduction, in the previous work on

collisional broadening in Be-like ions [6] we found that the CCC results and

experimental data systematically diverge along the isoelectronic sequence. A

reader might have already noticed that this is also the case in the present

comparison. Figure 7 shows the ratio of experimental to calculated CCC line

widths for the 3s−3p transition as a function of atomic number for all Belgrade

and Bochum data points presented in Figs. 1-6. (The two older data points

for Ne VIII [9] are not included in this plot.) The ratios using the Belgrade

experimental results are shown by the large shaded circles, while those using

the Bochum data are shown by the large open circles. The dashed line is added

to the plot in order to make the trend more visible. Further, we add the ratios

for the 2s3s − 2s3p line widths in Be-like ions [6] (small shaded and open

squares for the Bochum and Belgrade data, respectively) to emphasize that

the ratios are indeed very close for both isoelectronic sequences.

The fact that a very similar behavior in terms of the ratio between the exper-

imental and quantum-mechanical line widths is found for completely diﬀerent

11

experiments suggests a similar physical rather than instrumental or system-

atic experimental mechanism responsible for the deviation of experimental and

theoretical widths. As has already been mentioned above, in most of the ex-

periments an independent diagnostic is required for a reliable determination of

the electron density (and temperature). In order to eliminate the broadening

due to the opacity eﬀects, the measurements were done using small amounts

of test gas containing the impurity ions added to a major bulk gas. In both

series of experiments, Ne was determined from the bulk plasma (hydrogen in

Bochum experiments and helium in Belgrade measurements) using 90o Thom-

son scattering of laser light, or a well-known dependence of the Paschen-α line

of He II on Ne, respectively. The resolved impurity peak in the former mea-

surements indicated that the impurity density was ≤ 1% of Ne. Such measure-

ments are obviously carried out macroscopically and thus are insensitive to the

density ﬂuctuations near the multi-charged impurity ions. The local increase

of electron density near an impurity ion which has a higher Coulomb charge

than the background ions is obvious already from the Debye-H¨uckel picture

of a charge screening in plasmas. The recent detailed classical many-body and

molecular-dynamics calculations [26] of non-linear behavior of electrons near

a positive impurity ion for various plasma conditions (with a strong coupling

constant Γ = 0.03 − 0.5 which is much larger than that in both Belgrade and

Bochum experiments) indeed show an increase of electron density in the ion

vicinity. However, preliminary estimates based on the Debye-H¨uckel picture

do not seem to support the importance of this phenomenon for line broaden-

ing in the experiments discussed here. Needless to say, a detailed investigation

of how the local density ﬂuctuations near impurity ions could inﬂuence the

spectral line broadening would obviously be very helpful.

12

It should also be mentioned that the extra contribution to the line widths from

ion-impact broadening may be quite reliably estimated using the semiclassical

calculations of Ref. [8]. For the ions from B III to O VI the ion width was found

to not exceed 5% of the electron FWHM and thus it can be safely neglected

here.

The scaling of the impact widths for isolated lines has long been a subject

of detailed studies. The possibility of accurately predicting the unknown line

widths from those already measured and/or calculated is always a strong im-

petus to attack this problem. The regularities of the Stark broadening along

isoelectronic sequences have been discussed for some time in connection with

the critical reviews of Stark broadening data (see, e.g., [27] and references

therein). The scaling of the line widths with the ion spectroscopic charge can

be easily derived from the Baranger formula. If one assumes that only one per-

turbing transition contributes to the line width, then the inelastic contribution

is proportional to:

∆λinel ∝ λ2 hσvi .

(2)

For the ∆n = 0 transition the wavelength scales as λ ∝ 1/Z, the threshold

cross section σ ∝ 1/Z 3, so that for the line width one obtains ∆λinel ∝ 1/Z 5 for

the same electron temperatures. Our previous study of excitation cross sections

in Li-like ions with spectroscopic charge Z ≥ 4 [18] showed that the scaling

of the CCC cross sections slightly diﬀers from the 1/Z 3 dependence, and for

the 3s − 3p and 3p − 3d transitions, which are dominant in the present case,

the scaling is 1/ (Z + 1.75)3.4 and 1/ (Z + 0.44)3.5, respectively. This results

in modiﬁed scaling properties for the CCC line widths which are found to be

13

approximately

∆λCCC

inel ∝ 1/Z 17/4

(3)

(4)

for the ions considered in this work. The scaled products ∆λCCC

inel × Z 17/4 for

all ions from B III to Ne VIII are presented in Fig 8(a). One can see that the

scaling is accurate to only 10% for all values of Te and signiﬁcantly improves

with the increase of the spectroscopic charge.

The scaling of the elastic part of the line width, however, is not as obvious

as that of the inelastic one. For the problem in question the elastic scattering

is dominated by the polarization potential ∼ 1/r4 resulting from interactions

between the n = 3 states. The solutions for the elastic cross sections in a

central ﬁeld of the modiﬁed Blumington polarization potential [28]

V (r) = −

αD
2 (r2 + d2)2 ,

where αD is the dipole polarizability and d is the characteristic length of

the order of the atomic orbit, are well known for the Born and semiclassical

approximations. Since for the ∆n = 0 transitions αD ∼ 1/Z 3 and assuming

d ∼ 1/Z, the Z-scaling in these cases is σ ∼ 1/Z 3 and σ ∼ 1/Z 7/3, respectively.

However, we ﬁnd that the elastic cross sections 3s − 3s and 3p − 3p as well as

the elastic diﬀerence term exhibit a weaker scaling law, namely, σ ∼ 1/Z 3/2.

This diﬀerence may result from the fact that the theoretical Z-dependence

of the Born and semiclassical cross sections is ususally derived assuming that

the major contribution comes from the high partial waves L ≫ 1. On the

contrary, the present CCC calculations show that most of the elastic cross

sections is provided by the low partial waves with L . 3 − 4 only. Returning

14

to the Z-scaling of the elastic line widths, one immediately obtains that for

the same electron temperatures and σEDT ∼ 1/Z 3/2 the elastic contribution

to the line width scales as

∆λCCC

el ∝ 1/Z 7/2.

(5)

Somewhat better accuracy is actually achieved with a 1/Z 15/4 scaling which is

presented in Fig. 8(b), where the scaled line widths ∆λCCC

el × Z 15/4 are plotted

vs. electron temperature.

5 Conclusions

One of the most powerful techniques in the atomic collision theory–the conver-

gent close-coupling method–is applied here to the electron-impact broadening

of the isolated 3s − 3p lines in Li-like ions from B III to Ne VIII. The elas-

tic and inelastic contributions to the line width are explicitly calculated and

tabulated for electron temperatures from 2 to 20 eV. A comparison with avail-

able experimental data (mostly from the Belgrade and Bochum groups) shows

that although the quantum-mechanical data presented here agree well with

the measurements for lowest-charge ions, the disagreement progressively in-

creases with an increase of the ion charge. In no case is the experimental line

width smaller than the quantum-mechanical one, suggesting some additional

line broadening process in the higher-Z experiments.

Figure captions.

Figure 1. Collisional line widths for the 3s-3p transition in B III. Experiment:

Ref. [8] –✷. Theory: present work – solid line with solid circles, Griem (as

cited in Ref. [8]) – dot line, DSB [8] – short-dash line, Seaton [21] – dot-dash

line, DK (as cited in Ref. [8]) – long-dash line.

Figure 2. Collisional line widths for the 3s-3p transition in C IV. Most of

notations are the same as in Fig. 1. Experiment: Ref. [9] – (cid:13), Ref. [22] – ✸,

Ref. [23] – △, Ref. [24] – ▽. Theory: Alexiou [20] – ×, Burke [25] – dot-double-

dash line.

Figure 3. Collisional line widths for the 3s-3p transition in N V. Most of

notations are the same as in Fig. 1 and 2.

Figure 4. Collisional line widths for the 3s-3p transition in O VI. Most of

notations are the same as in Fig. 1 and 2. Theory: Seaton [21] – ∗, Hey and

Breger [19] – dash-double-dot line.

Figure 5. Collisional line widths for the 3s-3p transition in F VII. Most of

notations are the same as in Fig. 4. Experiment: Ref. [10] – (cid:13).

Figure 6. Collisional line widths for the 3s-3p transition in Ne VIII. Most of

notations are the same as in Fig. 4. Experiment: Ref. [11] – shaded circle.

Figure 7. Ratio of experimental and quantum-mechanical line widths vs. atomic

number. Li-like ions: circles, Be-like ions: squares. Ratios with the Belgrade

data correspond to shadowed symbols, while ratios with the Bochum data

correspond to open symbols.

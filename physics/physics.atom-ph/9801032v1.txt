The photodetachment cross section of
He− has been measured in the pho-
ton energy range 2.9 . . . 3.3 eV in or-
der to investigate doubly excited states.
Measurements were made channel spe-
ciﬁc by selectively detecting the resid-
ual He atoms left in a particular ex-
cited state following detachment. Three
Feshbach resonances were found in the
He(1s2p 3Po)+e−(ǫp) partial cross section:
a 4S resonance below the He(1s3s 3S)
threshold and two 4P resonances below
the He(1s3p 3Po) threshold. The mea-
sured energies of these doubly excited
states are 2.959 260(6) eV, 3.072(7) eV and
3.264 87(4) eV. The corresponding widths
are found to be 0.20(2) meV, 50(5) meV
and 0.61(5) meV. The measured ener-

1 Introduction

Doubly excited states of
two-electron
atomic systems provide us with an op-
portunity to investigate the interplay of
electron-electron and electron-core inter-
actions. Negative ions are of particular
interest because here the normally dom-
inant Coulomb interactions between the
electrons and the core are suppressed, thus
enhancing the role of the interelectronic in-
teraction. Pioneering photodetachment ex-
periments on the pure two-electron nega-
tive ion H− were ﬁrst performed by Bryant
and co-workers [1]. Several experiments
have been performed on Li− [2, 3], which

1

can be considered an eﬀective two-electron
ion since the two valence electron move in
a spherically symmetric potential created
by the inert Li+ core. The three-electron
He− ion is also an eﬀective two-electron
system at low photon energies since the 1s
core electron remains inert up to energies
of 40 eV and only slightly perturbs the mo-
tion of the two active outer electrons.

The He− ion is the prototype of an un-
usual class of negative ions that are not
stable, but rather metastable, against de-
cay via autodetachment. The lowest en-
ergy state of this ion is the 1s2s2p 4Po state,
which is bound by 77.516(6) meV rela-
tive to the 1s2s 3S state of He [4]. This
state can autodetach into the ground 1s2 1S
state of the He atom via the relatively
weak magnetic interactions. The J=5/2
level,
for example, has a measured life-
time of 350(15) µs [5], making the He− ion
suﬃciently long lived to survive a transit
through a typical ion beam apparatus.

There have been several previous exper-
imental investigations of the photodetach-
ment of He− [6–11] at photon energies in
the visible. Calculations of the He− pho-
todetachment cross section and resonance
parameters have also been made [12–20].
In this paper we present the results of a
recent photodetachment study of double
excitation in the He− ion in the energy
range 2.9 . . . 3.3 eV. We have observed one
resonance below the He(1s3s 3S) threshold
and two resonances below the He(1s3p 3Po)
threshold. We have identiﬁed the reso-
nances with the 1s3s4s 4S, 1s3p2 4P and
1s3p4p 4P states by comparing their mea-
sured energies with the results of a recent
MCHF calculation of Xi and Froese Fischer
[18]. The 1s3s4s 4S state has been studied
previously in a diﬀerent partial channel of
photodetachment [11].

Doubly excited states of He− have also

been studied in electron impact experi-
ments on helium targets [21–24]. Their
presence is manifested as resonance struc-
ture in scattering cross sections. Many res-
onance states of doublet symmetry have
been observed as transient intermediate
states in the electron scattering process.
Data on quartet
states, however, are
sparse. Such states appear as resonances in
the cross section of photodetachment from
the ground quartet state of the He− ion.
The energy resolution in photodetachment
experiments is typically much higher than
in electron scattering experiments. Thus,
the energies and widths of quartet states
can,
in principle, be measured more ac-
curately than the corresponding doublet
states. Selection rules on phototexcitation
of He− from the 1s2s2p 4Po ground state
limit, however, the study of doubly excited
states to those with 4S, 4P and 4D symme-
try.

2 Experiment

2.1 Procedure

The present measurements were made us-
ing a collinear laser-ion beam apparatus.
The experimental method has been previ-
ously used in studies of partial photode-
tachment cross sections for He− and Li−
[3, 11, 25]. It consists of several sequential
steps. A doubly excited state of a nega-
tive ion is ﬁrst produced by photoexcita-
tion from its ground state. The excited
ion then autodetaches leaving the resid-
ual atom, in general, in an excited state.
By selectively detecting those atoms left
in a particular state one can isolate the
corresponding decay channel and investi-
gate the partial cross section. The ex-
cited residual atoms are selected by use of
the method of resonance ionization spec-

troscopy, i.e. they are further photoexcited
to a Rydberg state which is subsequently
ﬁeld ionized in a static electric ﬁeld. The
resulting positive ion signal is proportional
to the partial cross section for the selected
decay channel.

The investigation of doubly excited
states of He− in the present experiment is
based on measurements of resonance struc-
ture in the partial photodetachment cross
section for the He(1s2p 3Po)+e−(ǫp) chan-
nel. The excitation-detection scheme used
is shown in ﬁgure 1.
In the ﬁrst step,
metastable He− ions are photodetached in
a laser ﬁeld of frequency ω1:

−

He

(1s2s2p 4Po) + ¯hω1 7→

−
He(1s2p 3Po) + e

(ǫp)

.

If, in addition, the above process proceeds
via an intermediate doubly excited state of
He−, resonance structure will appear in the
photodetachment cross section. This struc-
ture which, in general, has an asymmetric
shape, is the result of an interference be-
tween the resonant and non-resonant pho-
todetachment processes.

In the second step, He atoms, produced
in the 1s2p 3Po state, as a result of pho-
todetachment, are resonantly excited into
the 24d state by a laser ﬁeld of frequency
ω2, suﬃciently strong to saturate the tran-
sition. These Rydberg atoms are subse-
quently ionized in a static electric ﬁeld of
about 200 kV

where ❀ represents ﬁeld ionization.

The yield of the He+ ions produced in
this state-selective detection scheme was
recorded as a function of the frequency
ω1, while the frequency ω2 was held con-
stant on the transition to the Rydberg
state. The signal was proportional to the
population of helium atoms left in the
1s2p 3Po state after the photodetachment
step. Since the intensity of laser ω2 and
the ion beam current were constant during
a scan, the He+ signal, normalized to the
intensity of laser ω1, was proportional to
the He(1s2p 3Po)+e−(ǫp) partial photode-
tachment cross section.

The detection scheme, based on the se-
lective detection of residual He(1s2p 3Po)
atoms, was eﬀective in eliminating a po-
tential background source arising from He
atoms produced in the ion beam via au-
todetachment of the metastable ground
state of He−. These atoms, created in the
1s2 1S ground state, were not photoionized

2.2 Experimental arrangement
The He− beam was produced from a mass-
selected 4He+ ion beam via charge ex-
change in a Cs vapor cell. The beam en-
ergy was 3.1 keV and the ion current was
typically 1 nA.

In

the

region,

interaction

shown
schematically in ﬁgure 2, the laser and
ion beams were coaxially superimposed
over a distance of 50 cm between the
two electric quadrupole deﬂectors (QD1,
QD2). The beam paths were deﬁned by
apertures of 3 mm diameter at both ends
of the interaction region. The apparatus
has previously been described in more
detail [26, 27].

One source of background of He+ ions
arises from double detachment collisions
of He− with the residual gas. This con-

4

tribution was reduced signiﬁcantly by in-
stalling a pair of deﬂection plates (DP)
just before the second quadrupole deﬂec-
tor (QD2). The transverse electric ﬁeld
between the deﬂection plates was insuﬃ-
cient to ﬁeld ionize the Rydberg atoms,
but strong enough to sweep collisionally-
created He+ ions out of the beam. To mon-
itor the He− beam current, the deﬂection
plates were periodically grounded.

The highly excited Rydberg atoms of He
were ﬁeld ionized by the static electric ﬁeld
of the second quadrupole deﬂector (QD2).
The resulting He+ ions were, in turn, de-
ﬂected by this quadrupole into the positive
ion detector (PD), where they impinged
on a metal plate (MP) and produced sec-
ondary electrons. These electrons were de-
tected with a channel electron multiplier
(CEM).

The two laser frequencies ω1 and ω2 used
in the experiment were produced by two
dye lasers pumped by a common XeCl ex-
cimer laser that delivered pulses of about
15 ns duration. The laser light of frequency
ω2 was generated by PTP dye with a pulse
energy of typically 1 mJ. The tunable laser
light of frequency ω1 was generated by Ex-
alite 416, Exalite 411 and BBQ dyes with
pulse energies of typically 1 mJ. The signal
was normalized to the power of laser ω1.

For the measurement of the narrow res-
onances associated with the 1s3s4s 4S and
1s3p4p 4P states the frequency ω1 was cal-
ibrated by combining Fabry-Perot fringes
with reference lines generated in a hollow
cathode lamp. The Fabry-Perot fringes
served as frequency markers whereas the
reference transitions in argon and ura-
nium provided an absolute calibration of

3 Results and discussion

Typical spectral scans of the three reso-
nances in the He(1s2p 3Po)+e−(ǫp) partial
cross section are shown in ﬁgure 3.

In the case of the 1s3s4s 4S resonance
spectrum shown in ﬁgure 3(a) there is a
small background due mainly to the pop-
ulation of the 1s2p 3Po state of He by (a)
collisional detachment of He− ions and (b)
non-resonant photodetachment of He− by
laser ω2:

−

He

(1s2s2p 4Po) + ¯hω2 7→

−
He(1s2p 3Po) + e

(ǫp)

.

The He atoms formed in the 1s2p 3Po state
by either (a) or (b) will be resonantly ion-
ized according to the processes described in
equation (1). The collisional detachment
contribution (a) was reduced by maintain-
ing a pressure of 5×10−7 Pa (5×10−9 mbar)
in the interaction chamber. The contribu-
tion (b) was reduced by strongly attenuat-
ing the output of laser ω2. The output re-
mained suﬃciently strong, however, to sat-
urate the Rydberg transition.

A third source of background (c) can, in
principle, make a contribution. The non-
resonant photodetachment of He− via the
He(1s3s 3S)+e−(ǫs,d) channels will popu-
late the 1s3s 3S state of He. This state
will subsequently radiatively decay to the
1s2p 3Po state with a lifetime of 36 ns [28].
This process was found to be negligible
when induced by laser ω2 due to the previ-
ously mentioned attenuation of the output
of this laser. It can, however, make a con-
tribution when induced by laser ω1. An
exception is the 1s3s4s 4S spectrum where
the photon energy ω1 is insuﬃcient to pop-
ulate the 1s3s 3S state of the He atom. The
relatively short lifetime of the 1s3s 3S state
makes (c) an eﬃcient process for populat-
ing the 1s2p 3Po state. Unfortunately, this
contribution is proportional to the intensity
of laser ω1, and attenuation of this inten-
sity cannot be used to improve the signal-
to background ratio. It, however, remains

constant across the scan region of the spec-
tra shown in ﬁgure 3(b) and ﬁgure 3(c).
The signal-to-background ratio is lower for
the 1s3p4p 4P spectrum because the peak
photodetachment cross section for this res-
onance is smaller than for the 1s3p2 4P res-
onance [29].

The cross section σ(E) in the vicinity of

a resonance can be parametrized as [30]:

σ(E) = a +

bǫ + c
1 + ǫ2

ǫ =

E − E0
(Γ/2)

,

(2)

where E0 is the resonance energy, Γ is the
resonance width, E is the photon energy,
a is the background cross section, and b, c
are the Shore parameters. This function
is least-square ﬁtted to the weighted sig-
nal and shown as a solid line in ﬁgure 3.
More than 20 measured spectra were ana-
lyzed for each resonance. The background
was assumed to be constant over the scan
region for all the resonance spectra.

In the case of the narrow 1s3s4s 4S and
1s3p4p 4P resonances data were recorded
with both co- and counter-propagating
laser ω1 and ion beams. The geometric
mean of the measured blue- and red-shifted
resonance energies Eb,r
0 yields the Doppler-
free resonance energy E0=qEb
0. The
energy of the 4S resonance was found to
be

and the 1s3p4p 4P resonance energy was de-
termined to

.

For the relatively broad 1s3p2 4P reso-
it was suﬃcient to record data
nance,

with counter-propagating laser ω1 and ion
beams only.
The previously measured
1s3s4s 4S resonance was, in this case, used
to calibrate the laser wavelength scale and
to account for the Doppler shift.

All measured resonance energies and
to-
widths are also given in table 1,
gether with recent theoretical predictions.
In addition, the experimental values of
Klinkm¨uller et al
[11] measured in an-
other partial channel of photodetachment
are given. The quoted uncertainties in-
clude both the energy calibration uncer-
tainty and the statistical scatter of the ﬁt-
ted resonance parameters.

The table shows that there is a good
agreement between the measured and cal-
culated resonance energies.
It should
be pointed out that in the cases of the
1s3s4s 4S and 1s3p4p 4P states the exper-
imental precision signiﬁcantly exceeds that
of the calculation. There is, however, a no-
ticeable diﬀerence between the measured
and calculated widths. All four calcula-
tions are in essential agreement and all pre-
dict the 1s3p2 4P state to be narrower than
is measured. In the case of the 1s3p4p 4P
state, the two calculations that predict the
width disagree with each other and both
values are larger than the measured one.

Le Dourneuf and Watanabe [14] have cal-
culated both doublet and quartet doubly
excited He− resonances below the He(n=3)
thresholds using an adiabatic hyperspheri-
cal formalism for the two active electrons.
They found that the He+(1s) core only
slightly perturbed the motion of the outer
pair of electrons.
In fact, the wavefunc-
tions of the pair displayed correlation pat-
terns very similar to those found in H−.
It was suggested that this correspondence
allows a rovibrational classiﬁcation of the
doubly excited states of He−. Many reso-
nance states were labeled in this manner,

6

n. For example, in the case of the present
work, the resonance at 3.072 eV photon en-
ergy has been labeled by the dominant con-
ﬁguration, the 1s3p2 conﬁguration. This is
a reasonably valid label since, in this case,
1s3p2 conﬁguration amounts to about 79%
of the total composition. As a result of in-
creased angular correlation, however, the
contribution from the 1snd2 and other con-
ﬁgurations grow with n. For n>4 the 1snp2
conﬁguration no longer dominates and the
label becomes invalid. In this manner we
can investigate the gradual breakdown of
the independent electron model due to the
increased role of correlation in the deter-
mining the motion of the active pair of elec-
trons.

the 1s3s4s 4S and the 1s3p2 4P states ob-

sured width of the 4S state is very small

observation conﬁrms the radial correlation

4 Conclusion

In the present experiment the photodetach-
ment cross section of He− has been studied
in the photon energy range 2.9 . . . 3.3 eV.
Three Feshbach resonances associated with
the 1s3s4s 4S, 1s3p2 4P and 1s3p4p 4P dou-
bly excited states have been observed. The
measured energy positions of these states
agree well with recent theoretical predic-
tions, but the widths deviate noticeably
from calculations.

We hope to continue this work at higher
levels of excitation.
It will be interesting
to observe the evolution of states such as
1snpn′p 4P with increasing values of n, n′.
Of special interest are the intrashell reso-
nance states 1snp2 4P since it is believed
that the ladder of such states with increas-
ing n leads to double detachment. The
1s2p2 4P state appears as a shape resonance
[10] but for n>2 the state is bound with re-
spect to the excited atom and a series of
Feshbach resonances appear. These states
are the lowest lying in a manifold of 4P
states below the excited state thresholds.
Bylicki [19] and Themelis et al [16,17] have
calculated the energies and widths of these
intrashell resonance states up to n=7. Both
groups predict a narrowing of the states
with increasing n. Themelis and Nicolaides
show that the conﬁgurational composition
of these 4P states changes signiﬁcantly with

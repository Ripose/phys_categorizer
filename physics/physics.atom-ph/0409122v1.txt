Strongly Coupled Matter-Field and Non-Analytic Decay Rate of Dipole Molecules in
a Waveguide

The decay rate γ of an excited dipole molecule inside a waveguide is evaluated for the strongly
coupled matter-ﬁeld case near a cutoﬀ frequency ωc without using perturbation analysis. Due to
the singularity in the density of photon states at the cutoﬀ frequency, we ﬁnd that γ depends
non-analytically on the coupling constant g as g4/3.
In contrast to the ordinary evaluation of γ
which relies on the Fermi golden rule (itself based on perturbation analysis), γ has an upper bound
and does not diverge at ωc even if we assume perfect conductance in the waveguide walls. As a
result, again in contrast to the statement found in the literature, the speed of emitted light from
the molecule does not vanish at ωc and is proportional to cg2/3 which is on the order of 103 ∼ 104
m/s for typical dipole molecules.

It has been well known for many years that enhanced
and inhibited spontaneous emission can be observed for
an atom in a resonator above and below a cutoﬀ fre-
quency [1, 2]. An explanation of this alternation has been
proposed by Kleppner based on the combination of the
Fermi golden rule for the transition rate and a change of
the density of photon states in a resonator. In his calcu-
lation, the singularity in the density of states at a cutoﬀ
frequency ωc may lead to a vast increase of the decay rate
γ of an excited atom or molecule compared to the free-
space value. This prediction has been veriﬁed by several
experiments [3]-[7]. However, Kleppner’s approach, while
going in the right direction, is inconsistent. This is ap-
parent because the Fermi golden rule is not applicable in
the domain of a vast increase in the decay rate, as this
rule is only valid for a weakly coupled matter-ﬁeld system
where the perturbation analysis may be applied. Due to
this inconsistency, γ diverges in Kleppner’s theory for the
case in which the resonator is made of a perfectly con-
ducting material and the characteristic frequency ω1 of
the atom approaches ωc. The decay rate γ then vanishes
for ω1 < ωc.

The purpose of this Letter is to re-evaluate γ for a
strongly coupled case around ωc without using perturba-
tion analysis. The result shows that γ is ﬁnite at ωc even
if we assume perfect conductance. We ﬁnd that the maxi-
mum value of γ depends non-analytically on a dimension-
less coupling constant g as g4/3 (instead of g2 which is
assumed in Fermi’s golden rule). For small g
1, γ is
enhanced by a factor of g−2/3 over the free-space value
of γ that is proportional to g2. Moreover, the frequency
value at which the unstable solution disappears is found
not at ω1 = ωc, but at ω1 = ωs, which lies slightly below
g4/3ωc. Again, this value is much

To present the results, let us consider a dipole molecule
(such as HCl, NaCl or KBr) that is on the order of a
nanometer in size and which has a charge of +Ze on
one end and charge
Ze on the other end. This charge
couples the dipole to the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the rect-
angular waveguide. The waveguide runs parallel to the
z-axis and extends to inﬁnity in either diection. We refer
to the width of the waveguide in the x-direction as a and
to the height of the waveguide in the y-direction as b. We
assume b
a. The origin of z is chosen at an arbitrary
point along the inﬁnite waveguide. We choose the origin
for x and y at the lower-left corner of the cross-section of
the waveguide. We assume that the center of mass of the
dipole is initially located near the center of the waveguide
at coordinates (a/2, b/2, 0). The characteristic frequency
of vibration ω1 for a typical dipole is on the order of 1014
to 1013 Hz, corresponding to a wavelength λ with 10 to
100µm, which is in the infrared range. Since the width of
the waveguide is much larger than the size of the dipole,
we can neglect the forces acting on the dipole from the
walls of the waveguide.

We may rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of the rela-
tive coordinate r1
ra, the center-of-mass coordi-
nate R, and their canonical conjugate momenta p1 and
P. In this discussion we are interested in distances much
larger than the size of the molecule, so that the particle
interacts with the ﬁeld at approximately the center-of-
mass (the so-called dipole approximation). We assume
that the velocity of the center-of-mass is so slow that
we can neglect its kinetic energy. We also assume the
ﬁeld is weak enough that we can neglect terms that are
proportional to A2. We ﬁrst consider the case in which
the dipole oscillates in the x direction (thus r1 = x1ˆex
and p1 = p1ˆex). The extension to arbitrary direction
will be discussed later. We then introduce the unper-
µω1/2[x1 + i(p1/µω1)]
turbed normal coordinate q1
of the dipole. With these assumptions, the Hamiltonian
(1) may be approximatelly written in a bilinear form with

The Hamiltonian (4) has exactly the same structure
as the Hamiltonian for the well-known Friedrichs model
with virtual processes [10, 11]. This model has been
investigated extensively in order to analyze the spon-

To ﬁnd the explicit form of these solutions, let us con-
sider the case in which ω1 is located below the next small-
est cutoﬀ frequency ωc2. The geometry of the waveguide
can be chosen in such a way that the cutoﬀ frequency
ωc is well separated from ωc2, and as such, we may have
ω1
ωc, or ωc < ω1 < ωc2 where ω1 is much closer to
ωc than ωc2. For this case the predominant contribution
to the integration in Eq. (5) comes from the component
with σ = E, m = 0 and n = 1. Approximating the inte-
gration by leaving out all other components and explic-
itly performing the integration, we obtain the dispersion

In this and the next ﬁgures we set

We note that γ does not depend of the size of the
molecule in the dipole approximation. One can show
that the vibrating motion of the dipole is stable when it
oscillates in the y direction, or in the z direction for our
illustrated case with ω1 < ωc2. As a result, we have the
same value of γ for molecules oriented in any direction of
space.

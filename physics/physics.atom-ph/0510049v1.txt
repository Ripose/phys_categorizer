Abstract

The accurate determination of atomic masses and the high-precision measurement of the
bound-electron g factor are prerequisites for the determination of the electron mass, which
is one of the fundamental constants of nature. In the 2002 CODATA adjustment [P. J. Mohr
and B. N. Taylor, Rev. Mod. Phys. 77, 1 (2005)], the values of the electron mass and the
electron-proton mass ratio are mainly based on g factor measurements in combination with
atomic mass measurements. In this paper, we brieﬂy discuss the prospects for obtaining
other fundamental information from bound-electron g factor measurements, we present
some details of a recent investigation of two-loop binding corrections to the g factor, and we
also investigate the radiative corrections in the limit of highly excited Rydberg S states with
a long lifetime, where the g factor might be explored using a double resonance experiment.

1 Introduction

The central equation for the determination of the electron mass me from g factor measurements
reads

me =

ωc
ωL

g |e|
2q

mion ,

(1)

where ωc is the cyclotron frequency of the ion, ωL the Larmor spin precession frequency, q
the ion charge, and mion its mass. The quantity e = −|e| is the elementary charge, and g is
the bound-electron g factor. In most practical applications, the ion is hydrogenlike, and the
frequency ratio ωc/ωL can be determined very accurately in a Penning trap [1, 2].
Equation (1) may now be interpreted in different ways:

• The ratio me/mion is immediately accessible, provided we assume that quantum electro-
dynamic theory holds for g. Provided the ratio mion/mp (with the proton mass mp) is
also available to sufﬁcient accuracy, the electron to proton mass ratio me/mp can be de-
termined by multiplication me/mion × mion/mp. In the recent CODATA adjustment [3],
the ratio me/mp has been determined using two measurements involving 12C.

• Let us suppose that mion is known to sufﬁcient accuracy. Assuming that quantum electro-
dynamic theory holds for g, we may then determine me from the measurement [4, 5, 6].

• The g factor depends on the reduced mass of the electron-ion two-particle system. An
accurate measurement of g can therefore yield an independent veriﬁcation of the isotopic
nuclear mass difference, provided that the masses of the ions have been determined be-
forehand to sufﬁcient accuracy [7].

• Direct access to the electron g factor in a weak external magnetic ﬁeld depends on the
property of the nucleus having zero spin. According to a relatively recent proposal [8, 9],
the measurement of a g factor for a nucleus with non-zero spin can be used to infer the
nuclear g factor, provided the purely electronic part of the g factor is known to sufﬁcient
accuracy from other measurements.

• There is also a proposal for measuring g factors in lithiumlike systems, and theoretical
work in this direction has been undertaken [10]. Provided the contribution due to electron-
electron correlation can be tackled to sufﬁcient accuracy, a measurement of the g factor
in lithiumlike systems could give access to the nuclear-size effect, which in turn can be
used as an additional input for other determinations of fundamental constants.

• Finally, provided the mass mion of a high-Z ion is known to sufﬁcient accuracy and me
is taken from g factor measurements at lower nuclear charge number, the high-Z ex-
perimental result for g may be compared to a theoretical prediction, yielding a test of
quantum electrodynamics for a bound particle subject to an external magnetic ﬁeld and a
strong Coulomb ﬁeld (see, e.g., Sec. 2.2 of [11]). Alternatively, one may invert the rela-
tion g = g(α) to solve for the ﬁne-structure constant (important precondition: knowledge
of nuclear size effect) [8, 12]. The feasibility of the latter endeavour in various ranges of
nuclear charge numbers will be discussed in the current article.

These examples illustrate the rich physics implied by g factor measurements in combination
with the determination of atomic masses via Penning traps. Indeed, the g factor is a tremendous
source of information regarding fundamental constants, fundamental interactions and nuclear
properties.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy discuss the importance and the status
of atomic mass measurements for further advances. In Sec. 3, we describe a few details of two
recent investigations [5, 6] regarding one- and two-loop binding corrections to the g factor,
and in Sec. 4, we discuss the asymptotics of the corrections for high quantum numbers, with a
partially surprising result, before dwelling on connections of the g factor to nuclear effects and
the ﬁne-structure constant in Sec. 5. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. 6. An Appendix is devoted
to the current status of the free-electron anomaly.

2 Atomic Mass Measurements – Present and Future

A review of the current status of atomic mass measurements can be in found in Ref. [13].
Experimental details regarding modern atomic mass measurements, with a special emphasis

2

on hydrogenlike ions, can be found in Refs. [14, 15]. Regarding the current status of mass
measurements, one may point out that some of the masses of S, Kr and Xe ions have recently
been determined with an accuracy of better than 1 part in 1010 (Ref. [16]). For molecular ions,
the accuracy has recently been pushed below 10−11 [17].
Recent measurements for the hydrogenlike ions 24Mg11+ and 26Mg11+ (Ref. [14]) and 40Ca19+
(Ref. [18]), as well as for the lithiumlike ion 40Ca17+ (Ref. [18]) have reached an accuracy of
about 5 × 10−10. These experiments pave the way for accurate determinations of fundamen-
tal constants using g factor measurements in these systems. At the University of Mainz [19]
(MATS collaboration) and at the University of Stockholm [18] (SMILE-TRAP), there are plans
to signiﬁcantly extend and enhance atomic mass measurements (including many more isotopes
and nuclei) over the next few years, with accuracies below 1 part in 1011 or even 1012. Eventu-
ally, one may even hope to determine the nuclear size effect of a speciﬁc ion by “weighing” the
Lamb shift of the ground state. In the same context, one may point out that the masses of differ-
ent charge states of ions are determined vice versa by adding and subtracting binding energies.
This implies, e.g., that the mass of 12C5+ in terms of the mass of neutral carbon, m(12C) = 12 u,
is given by

m(12C5+) = m(12C) − 5 me + c−2 EB ,
(2)
where EB = 579.835(1) × 10−9 uc2 is the cumulative binding energy for all 5 electrons [20].
This relation has proven useful in the determination of the electron mass [7].

In order to make a comparison to the accuracy of the free-electron determination of α, it is per-
haps useful to remember that in the seminal work [21], the free-electron and positron anomaly
has been determined to an accuracy 4 × 10−9. This translates into a level of accuracy of about
4 × 10−12 for the g factor itself. The accuracy of the current value of α is 4 × 10−9 [3].

3 Calculation of the Bound–Electron g Factor

The bound-electron g factor measures the energy change of a bound electron (hydrogenlike ion,
spinless nucleus) under a quantal change in the projection of the total angular momentum with
respect to an axis deﬁned by a (weak) external magnetic ﬁeld. In this sense, the g factor of a
bound electron should rather be termed the gJ factor (according to the Land´e formulation).
However, for S states, the total angular momentum number is equal to the spin quantum number,
and therefore it has been common terminology not to distinguish the notation for g and gJ .
For a general hydrogenic state, the Dirac-theory g factor, denoted gD, reads (see [9] and refer-
ences therein)

Here, Enj is the Dirac energy, and the quantum numbers n, j and κ have their usual meaning.
For S, P and D states, Eq. (3) leads to the following expressions (we here expand the bound-

would be different from the free-electron Dirac value g = 2, even for S states and even in the
absence of quantum electrodynamic loop corrections.

We now brieﬂy summarize the results of recent investigations [5, 6] of the bound-electron g
factor, which is based on nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED). The central result
of this investigation is the following semi-analytic expansion in powers of Zα and ln(Zα) for
the bound-electron g factor (nS state) in the non-recoil and pointlike-nucleus limit (for recoil
effects see e.g. Ref. [22]):

This expansion is valid through the order of two loops (terms of order α3 are neglected). The
notation is in part inspired by the usual conventions for Lamb-shift coefﬁcients [23]: the (lower
case) a terms denote the one-loop effects, with akj denoting the coefﬁcient of a term propor-
tional to α (Zα)k lnj[(Zα)−2]. The b terms denote the two-loop corrections, with bkj multiply-
ing a term proportional to α2 (Zα)k lnj[(Zα)−2]. In [5, 6], complete results are derived for the
coefﬁcients a41, a40, b41 and b40, valid for arbitrary excited S states in hydrogenlike systems.

In Eq. (5), the term underlined by “Breit (1928), Dirac theory” corresponds to the prediction
of relativistic atomic theory, including the relativistic corrections to the wave function [24]. By
contrast, the term α
2) in the expression underlined by “one-loop correction” gives just the
leading (Schwinger) correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of a free electron. This latter
effect is modiﬁed here by additional binding corrections to the one-loop correction, which give
rise e.g. to terms of order α (Zα)2 and higher (in Zα). Perhaps, it is also worth clarifying that
the term −0.656958 is just twice the two-loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment
of a free electron, which is usually quoted as ( α

π )2 (−0.328479) in the literature.

Here, ln k0(nS) is the Bethe logarithm for an nS state, and ln k3(nS) is a generalization of the
Bethe logarithm to a perturbative potential of the form 1/r3 (see also Table 1 below). Vacuum
polarization adds a further n-independent contribution of (−16/15) to a40 [25]. Higher-order
binding corrections to the one-loop self-energy contribution to the g factor have been consid-
ered, e.g., in [26], and for the vacuum-polarization contribution, one may consult, e.g., Ref. [27].

Our result for b40 includes contributions from all two-loop effects (see Fig. 21 of [28] for the

4 Asymptotics for High Quantum Numbers

It is interesting to study the limit of the coefﬁcients a40 and b40 in the limit of highly excited
states, n → ∞. For the Bethe logarithm ln k0, such a study has recently been completed (see
Refs. [29, 30]). The asymptotics of the generalized Bethe logarithm ln k3 have not yet been
determined. We here supplement the numerical result for 8S. In Eq. (72) of Ref. [6], results
have been communicated for S states with n ≤ 7.

The result for n = 8 conﬁrms the trend of a monotonic increase of ln k3 with n (see Fig. 2). On
the other hand, based on the general experience regarding the structure of radiative corrections
in the limit n → ∞, we would expect a constant limit of ln k3(nS) for n → ∞. Using an
extrapolation scheme similar to the one employed in [31], we conjecture the following limit
(see Fig. 3),

lim
n→∞

ln k3(nS) = 10 ± 2 ,

(8)

It would be very interesting to verify this limit by an explicit calculation, e.g., using the tech-
niques outlined in Ref. [29].

Highly excited Rydberg states are characterized by a long lifetime. In a Penning trap, however,
the conﬁning electric ﬁelds would tend to quench transitions to lower-lying levels. One might
attempt a measurement of a g factor of a Rydberg state via a double-resonance approach, with
one laser driving the spin ﬂip (Larmor precession frequency) and another being tuned to a
transition between Rydberg states [32].

5 Bound–Electron g Factor, Nuclear Effects and the Fine–

Structure Constant

In Figs. 4 and 5, we indicate three primary sources of the theoretical uncertainty of the bound-
electron g factor across the entire range of nuclear charge numbers (these are the ﬁne-structure
constant, higher-order unknown two-loop effects and the nuclear radius). For a determination of
the ﬁne-structure constant using the bound-electron g factor, the experimental accuracy would
have to be improved to a value below the corresponding uncertainty curve in Figs. 4 and 5.
Such a determination would constitute a very important and attractive additional pathway, using
bound-state quantum electrodynamics, as an alternative to the “usual” determination based on
the free-electron g factor.

7

However, before we dwell further on the ﬁne-structure constant, we brieﬂy discuss a further
shift/uncertainty of the g factor which is caused by the nuclear ﬁnite-size effect (nuclear volume
effect). Typically, the uncertainty due to this effect is numerically small and, with the exception
of the case Z = 5, smaller than the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction for the g factor due
to higher-order quantum electrodynamic two-loop binding corrections (see Figs. 4 and 5). In
evaluating the uncertainty due to the nuclear radius, we have used the most recent values for the
root-mean-square (rms) nuclear radii [33].

In order to investigate the sensitivity of the bound-electron g factor on the ﬁne-structure con-
stant, we approximate the g factor by the ﬁrst two terms in the Zα-expansion of the Dirac theory
and the one-loop correction, and obtain

For a determination of α, it is desirable, in principle, to tune the parameters so that the modulus

(cid:2)

For nuclear charge numbers in the (ﬁctitious) range 5 ≤ Z ≤ 6, the sensitivity of g on α suffers
from a cancellation of the one-loop against the Dirac binding corrections (see also Figs. 4 and 5),

Nuclear Charge Number Z

Figure 5: A close-up of Fig. 4 in the range of small quantum numbers n illustrates
that an alternative determination of the ﬁne-structure constant, based on the cur-
rent theoretical status, would be possible for ionized helium (4He+) and beryllium
(10Be+). The 6,7Li nuclei are not spinless.

For large Z, one may ﬁnd a crude approximation to Eq. (9) by the relation

(11)

The enhancement of the theoretical uncertainty of g with Z is manifest in Fig. 4. In principle,
one might assume that a measurement at high Z could be more favourable for a determination of
α than a corresponding experiment in a low-Z system. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the nuclear
structure alone currently entails an uncertainty of g that is larger than the uncertainty due to the
ﬁne-structure constant, for large Z. Also, the uncertainty due to higher-order unknown two-loop
binding corrections currently represents an obstacle for an alternative determination of α from
a g factor measurement at high Z.

Reversing the argument, one may point out that, provided the two-loop uncertainty of the the-
oretical prediction for large Z can be reduced substantially, one may infer the nuclear radius
from the measurement of the g factor. Again, going one step further and assuming that the nu-
clear radius is accurately known from other measurements, e.g., Lamb shift experiments or g
factor measurements in lithiumlike systems, one may eventually hope to infer the ﬁne-structure
constant from a high-Z measurement. This endeavour can thus be interpreted as a rather difﬁ-
cult combined effort of theory and experiment, with results not to be expected in the immediate
future, but providing a very interesting perspective in the medium and long term. In particular,
this endeavour would depend on a successful evaluation, nonperturbative in Zα, of all two-loop
binding corrections to the bound-electron g factor.

As Fig. 5 shows, the determination of α based on the bound-electron g factor currently appears

9

much more promising for extremely light systems, such as 4He+. The measurement of g factor,
however, would deﬁnitely have to be carried out with an accuracy better than 10−11 in order to
match the current accuracy for α. Alternatively (see Fig. 4), the planned g factor measurement
in 40Ca19+ could potentially lead to a value of α that matches the accuracy of the free-electron
value, provided the two-loop uncertainty (higher-order binding corrections) can be reduced and
provided the accuracy of the atomic mass determination can be enhanced beyond 10−10. With
current theory, the accuracy of the determination of α from the 40Ca19+ measurements is limited
to an accuracy of about two orders of magnitude less than the free-electron value.

A ﬁnal word on the electron mass: For a speculative alternative determination of α in a high-Z
experiment, the current accuracy of me, based on the carbon and oxygen measurements [1, 2,
4, 5, 6, 26] is sufﬁcient. We recall the values (evaluated using the most recent theory [6])

me(12C5+) =0.000 548 579 909 32(29) u ,

me(16O7+) =0.000 548 579 909 60(41) u .

However, if an alternative determination of α via low-Z measurements is pursued in earnest,
then it becomes necessary to improve the value of me beyond the 10−11 threshold.

6 Conclusions

In Sec. 2, we emphasize the importance of current high-precision and upcoming ultra-high
precision atomic mass measurements for the determination of fundamental physical constants,
in combination with bound-electron g factor measurements in hydrogenlike systems. One of
the celebrated achievements connected to g factor measurements lies in the improvement of
the accuracy of the electron mass by a factor of 4, as compared to the previous value based on
measurements involving protons and electrons in Penning traps [34].

The expansion of the bound-electron g factor in terms of the two most important parameters in
the non-recoil limit is discussed in Sec. 3. These are the loop expansion parameter α (the ﬁne-
structure constant) and the Coulomb binding parameter Zα, where Z is the nuclear charge num-
ber. Furthermore, in Sec. 4, we analyze generalized Bethe logarithms, termed ln k3, which are
relevant for binding corrections to the g factor, in the limit of large principal quantum number
(i.e., for highly excited Rydberg states). The calculation of the result ln k3(8S) = 5.022 275 220
(see Table 1), facilitates the analysis of the asymptotic limit. The discussion is accompanied by a
tentative proposal [32] for a double-resonance experiment, to probe the bound-electron g factor
for highly excited Rydberg states with a long lifetime. In Sec. 5, we discuss prospects for de-
terminations of nuclear properties, and of the ﬁne-structure constant, based on measurements in
various ranges of the nuclear charge number. An alternative measurement of the ﬁne-structure
constant, of comparable accuracy to the free-electron value, could be accomplished via mea-
surements at low Z, provided the experimental accuracy of the g factor can be pushed beyond 1
part in 1011, and provided the electron mass can be determined to sufﬁcient accuracy (see also
Figs. 4 and 5). A priori, combined ultra-high precision measurements in 4He+ and 10Be3+ ap-
pear to provide for a viable approach, provided the atomic mass measurements of 4He and 10Be
can reach comparable accuracy (now, the experimental accuracy stands at 1.5 parts in 1011 for

10

4He, see Ref. [13]). The two measurements in He and Be could provide input data for a coupled
system of equations, to be solved for α and me.

By contrast, considerable further theoretical and experimental progress (concerning, e.g., nu-
clear radii) is required before any such endeavour could be realized in the domain of high nu-
clear charges. The prerequisites are outlined in Sec. 5. We conclude that even in the absence of
this progress, prospective measurements at higher Z will yield a rather interesting veriﬁcation
of quantum electrodynamics in the high-ﬁeld domain.

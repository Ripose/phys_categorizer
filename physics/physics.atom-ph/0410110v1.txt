(Dated: February 21, 2014)

By varying the density of an ultracold 88Sr sample from 109 cm

−3, we make
the ﬁrst deﬁnitive measurement of the density-related frequency shift and linewidth broadening of
the 1S0 - 3P1 optical clock transition in an alkaline earth system. In addition, we report the most
accurate measurement to date of the 88Sr 1S0 −3 P1 optical clock transition frequency. Including a
detailed analysis of systematic errors, the frequency is 434 829 121 312 338 ± 20stat ± 26sys Hz.

Neutral-atom-based optical frequency standards are
becoming serious contenders for the realization of highly
stable and accurate optical atomic clocks [1, 2, 3].
Progress in this ﬁeld is rapid, with signiﬁcant ad-
vances in experimental techniques from several related
ﬁelds including laser cooling to ultracold temperatures
[4, 5, 6, 7], trapping conﬁgurations suitable for highly ac-
curate clocks [3], the development of high quality optical
local oscillators [8], and precise frequency measurement
and distribution enabled by femtosecond optical combs
[9, 10, 11].

Several systems have been proposed for neutral-atom-
based optical clocks, each emphasizing narrow intercom-
bination transitions in alkaline earth [1, 2, 12, 13, 14] and
Yb atoms [15, 16]. High resolution spectroscopic tech-
niques employed to date include recoil-free absorption
inside one-dimensional optical lattices [13], free space
Ramsey interrogation and atom interferometry [17], and
free space saturated absorption [18]. Of the proposed
systems the fermionic strontium isotope, 87Sr, is partic-
ularly exciting as it oﬀers a weakly allowed 1S0 - 3P0
optical clock transition with a potential resonance qual-
ity factor exceeding 1015 and reduced polarization de-
pendence and collisional shifts of the clock frequency
when the atoms are conﬁned inside magic-wavelength op-
tical lattices [3, 19, 20]. However, the large nuclear spin
(I = 9/2) brings complexity in state preparation and
ﬁeld control. Recently new schemes have emerged that
take advantage of the most abundant spin-zero isotope
(88Sr) by engineering a 1S0 - 3P0 clock transition with a
perfect scalar nature [21].

In this Letter, we present precision spectroscopy of
ultracold 88Sr in free space. With reference to the Cs
primary standard and with a detailed investigation and
analysis of systematic frequency shifts, we determine the
absolute frequency of the 1S0
3 P1 clock transition with
a statistical (systematic) uncertainty of 20(26) Hz. This
level of measurement precision represents an improve-
ment of more than 200 times over recent studies per-
formed with a thermal atomic beam [22]. Collision-
related frequency shifts can signiﬁcantly impact both
the stability and accuracy of microwave and optical fre-
quency standards. These eﬀects have been studied in

For optical frequency standards based on intercombina-
tion transitions in alkaline earth atoms, it is expected
that the dependence of the fractional frequency shift on
the atomic density is reduced by more than three orders
of magnitude in comparison to Cs clocks [26]. Previous
eﬀorts to measure this eﬀect in Ca, however, were ham-
109 cm−3, resulting
pered by low sample densities n
in measured shift coeﬃcients with errors exceeding their
associated absolute values [27]. To overcome this limi-
tation, we have performed absolute frequency measure-
ments with 1 µK 88Sr atoms for densities spanning three
orders of magnitude, from 109 cm−3 to 1012 cm−3. For
the ﬁrst time we report deﬁnitive density-related line cen-
ter shifts and spectral broadening of an optical clock tran-
sition in ultracold atoms. We ﬁnd the density-dependent
fractional frequency shift is 250 times smaller than that
of Cs.

ing and trapping, probe laser preparation, and absolute
optical frequency measurement are described elsewhere
[7, 28]. Measurements reported here utilize 106 to 108
atoms cooled to
1 µK. Spectroscopic probing of the
1S0 - 3P1 clock transition is performed in free space af-
ter the trapping laser beams and the quadrupole mag-
netic ﬁeld are extinguished. The atomic density n dur-
ing spectroscopic probing is varied by changing either the
initial atom number in the trap or the free-ﬂight time af-
ter the atoms are released to free space. The typical
free-ﬂight times range from 5 to 20 ms. Spatial densities
are determined from calibrated ﬂuorescence images. The
probe laser linewidth is <100 Hz. The laser’s absolute
frequency is measured continuously via a femtosecond
optical comb that is locked to a Cs-referenced hydrogen
maser via a ﬁber optic link to NIST [31]. The probe laser
is split into two counter-propagating beams, each coupled
respectively into a single-mode, polarization-maintaining
optical ﬁber before delivery to the atomic cloud. The
probe beams have 1/e diameters of 3 mm, > 50 m radius
of curvature at the atom cloud, and are precisely over-
lapped (<50 µRad mutual tilt angle) by back coupling
each beam into the opposing beam’s ﬁber launcher. Both
beams are normal to gravity to within 1 mRad. To selec-
tively probe the 1S0 (m = 0) to 3P1 (m′ = 0) transition,
the linear probe beam polarization is parallel (within 10
mRad) to a 4.6(2) G bias magnetic ﬁeld turned on during
the measurement cycle. The counter-propagating beam
intensities are balanced to within 2.5% by monitoring
ﬂuorescence signals from the atomic sample. The single

beam intensity (saturation of
onant π-pulse time of
87 µs compared to the eﬀective
probe pulse duration of 100 µs. Each point in a given
trace of the atomic resonance is independently normal-
ized by the simultaneously measured atom number.

Before proceeding further it is important to emphasize
that the counter-propagating beam conﬁguration is es-
sential to obtaining accurate values for the 1S0 - 3P1 line
center frequency. The ultracold 88Sr temperature oﬀers
an advantage in reducing systematic frequency shifts as-
sociated with atomic motion. However, we ﬁnd that due
to trapping-beam-intensity imbalance the atomic cloud
acquires typical drift velocities along the probe beam axis
of
1 mm/s after release from the trap [29]. Although
small, this drift corresponds to a frequency shift of 1.5
kHz if a single probe beam is used for the spectroscopy.
This frequency oﬀset is canceled without perturbing the
line shape if the atomic sample is illuminated by two
equal intensity, counter-propagating probe beams. The
presence of both beams also enables cancellation of the
ﬁrst-order gravity-induced Doppler shift. For the more
realistic
2.5% intensity balance achieved here, the line
shape is unperturbed but the true line center remains
uncertain by
20 Hz, an eﬀect that could be eliminated
in future measurements by using an optical cavity to es-
tablish the two probe beams. Finally, note the two beam
conﬁguration described here is not equivalent to satu-
rated absorption since the ﬂuorescence induced by both

Ramsey interrogation is not well suited to free-space mea-
surements of the 88Sr 1S0 - 3P1 transition as its linewidth
is slightly larger than the single-photon recoil frequency.
Hence the Ramsey time required to align the recoil com-
ponents exceeds the excited state lifetime.

The density-related frequency shift and linewidth-

s-wave collisions [26, 30]. According to Ref.
[26], the
clock shift (in Hz) is ∆ν = 4n(h/m)Ls, where m is the
atomic mass, h is Planck’s constant, and Ls is a length
that for ﬁnite collision temperatures is bound to the or-

Elastic collisions do not account for the relatively large
linewidth (wL) broadening observed here. For inelastic
contributions, quenching of the 3P1 excited state was
expected to be dominated by 3P1 + 3P1 rather than
3P1 + 1S0 collisions. The quenching rate constant for
3P1 + 3P1 collisions has not been determined previously.
An estimate based on the S-matrix formalism described
above however limits the linewidth broadening coeﬃcient
10−10 Hz cm3, or 140 times smaller than the
to
measured value. Other mechanisms are then most likely
responsible for the observed linewidth broadening. This
conclusion is supported by the experimental observation
that changing the fractional 3P1 density does not signiﬁ-
cantly alter wL, indicating 3P1 + 3P1 quenching collisions
are not the primary broadening mechanism. We have
also experimentally ruled out any signiﬁcant linewidth
contributions due to depolarization of 3P1 to the lower
Zeeman level by 1S0 collisions in the presence of the bias
magnetic ﬁeld. Note, however, that the relatively large
Sr C3 coeﬃcient leads to non-negligible p-wave contribu-
tions to the 3P1 + 1S0 process even at a temperature
400 nK. Thus higher order partial waves may make
∼
signiﬁcant contributions to the scattering process. An-
other experimental observation reveals that for a given
range of n, a longer free-ﬂight time (compensated by us-
ing a larger initial number of atoms) gives rise to a larger
broadening coeﬃcient. Here it is likely that the eﬀec-
tive thermal collision momentum k among neighboring
atoms is reduced due to their directional correlations in

tainties are given in Table I. The ﬁrst four items detail
the residual Doppler eﬀect from the atomic motion in

due to residual electric and magnetic ﬁelds. All have
negligible contributions to the present uncertainty. The
correction due to a single-photon recoil (
4775 Hz) is
known to 1 mHz. To ensure that corrections for multiple
photon recoils are unnecessary, we have veriﬁed that no
signiﬁcant shift to the line center occurs for a factor of
two decrease in the overall optical power. The systematic
uncertainty is then dominated by eﬀects arising from the
probe beam intensity imbalance. Along with the 20 Hz
uncertainty described previously (Table 1, probe power
balance II), intensity mismatch gives, via the photon re-
coil, a quadratic blue shift that contributes another 15

we have also performed the ﬁrst deﬁnitive measurement
of density-related frequency shifts and linewidth broad-
ening for an optical clock transition.

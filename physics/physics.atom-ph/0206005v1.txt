We report a clear evidence of atomic fractals in the nonlinear motion of a two-level atom strongly
coupled to a standing-wave microcavity. Fractal-like structures, typical for chaotic scattering, are
numerically found in the dependence of exit times of cold atoms on their initial momenta in the
generic semiclassical models of cavity QED (1) with coupled external and internal degrees of freedom
of an atom in a near resonant light and (2) with atoms in a far-detuned amplitude- or phase-
modulated standing wave. Tiny interplay between external and internal degrees of freedom in
the ﬁrst model is responsible for trapping atoms even in a very short microcavity.
It may lead
simultaneously, at least, to two kinds of atomic fractals, a countable fractal (a set of initial momenta
generating separatrix-like atomic trajectories) and a seemingly uncountable fractal with a set of
momenta generating inﬁnite oscillations of atoms inside the cavity.

Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) with cold
atoms is a rapidly growing ﬁeld of atomic physics and
quantum optics studying the atom-photon interaction in
cavities [1]. Recent experiments [2, 3] succeeded in explo-
ration coupled external atomic center-of-mass, internal
atomic, and ﬁeld dynamics under condition of strong-
coupling between a single cold atom and a single-mode
ﬁeld in a high-ﬁnesse optical microcavity. Methods to
monitoring the atomic motion in real time have been re-
alized experimentally. They open a new way to study
the very foundations of the matter-ﬁeld interaction and
use particles trapped within a cavity mode for quantum
communications, to monitoring of chemical and biolog-
ical processes at the single-molecule scale and for other
purposes.

The basic model Hamiltonian of the interaction of a
two-level atom with a single-mode standing-wave ﬁeld in
an ideal cavity is given by

where ˆx and ˆp are the atomic position and momentum
operators, ˆσ the atomic Pauli operators, ˆa and ˆa† the
ﬁeld-mode operators. The strongly coupled atom-ﬁeld
system (1) is a highly nonlinear one and is known to
possess a rich variety of qualitatively diﬀerent dynamics.
Its semiclassical version has been shown [4, 5] to display
chaotic behavior in the sense of extremal sensitivity to
small changes in initial conditions. In this Letter we re-
port a clear evidence of atomic fractals in cavity QED, a
new property of the coupled atom-ﬁeld dynamics.

In the strong-coupling limit, one neglects dissipation in
all the degrees of freedom that may be justiﬁed by avail-
able microcavities with very large quality factors Q & 106
[2, 3] or/and operating with far-detuned atoms. We wish
to illustrate a generic eﬀect of fractals in cavity QED and
use an ideal model (1) with no degradation caused by
losses. A comparatively large average number of photons

is supposed in a single-mode cavity to sustain atom-ﬁeld
Rabi oscillations. By using the following expectation val-
ues:

(2) becomes integrable with solutions describing regular
atomic center-of-mass motion in a potential well or over
potential hills and atom-ﬁeld Rabi oscillations modulated
by the translational motion [4]. Out of resonance, the
atomic translational motion is described by the equation
for nonlinear parametric pendulum, ¨ξ + αu(τ ) sin ξ = 0,
that has been analytically shown [6] to produce weak
chaos even in the case of the simplest harmonic modula-
cos Ωτ caused by the Rabi oscillations with a
tion u(τ )

In fact, the Rabi
oscillations is an amplitude- and frequency-modulated
signal which induces pronounced erratic motion of the
atomic center-of-mass inside the cavity. The motion is

goes to inﬁnity. In this zone small changes in frequency,
caused by respective small changes in energy, may lead to
dramatic changes in phase which are the ultimate reason
of exponential instability of atomic motion in a periodic
standing wave.

The speculations above have been conﬁrmed in our
numerical experiments [4, 5] where positive values of
the maximal Lyapunov exponent have been found in the
following ranges of the control parameters: α & 10−3,
N . 102, and
. 1.5. These magnitudes seem to be
reasonable with available optical microcavities in which
the strength of the atom-ﬁeld coupling may reach the val-
108 Hz, and the conditions
ues of the order of Ω0

of strong coupling are fulﬁlled for both the internal and
external degrees of freedom [2, 3].

In FIG. 1a we depict the scheme of a gedanken exper-
iment that consists of a Fabry-Perot optical microcavity
with two detectors and cold atoms to be placed in the
cavity. To avoid complications that are not essential to
the main theme of this work, we consider the cavity with
only two standing-wave lengths. Atoms, one by one, are
placed at the point ξ = 0 with diﬀerent initial values of
the momentum ρ0i along the cavity axis. We measure
a time when an atom reaches one of the detectors, the
exit time T , and study the dependence T (ρ0) under the

2

other equal initial conditions imposed on the atom and
the cavity ﬁeld. At exact resonance, δ = 0, optical po-
tential coincides with the standing-wave structure. Using
the solutions of Eqs. (2) with δ = 0 [4], the analytical
expression for the dependence in question can be easily
found

Out of resonance (δ

= 0), the atomic motion has
been numerically found [4, 5] and analytically proven
[6] to be chaotic with positive values of the maximal
Lyapunov exponent. FIG. 2a shows the function T (ρ0)
with the normalized detuning δ = 0.4, the recoil fre-
quency α = 10−3, the number of excitations N = 10,
and the following initial conditions: ξ0 = 0, z0 = 0, and
u0 = v0 = 2.17945. Atoms with comparatively small
initial momentum, ρ0 . 63, cannot reach the detectors
because they are trapped in a well. With increasing ρ0,
the exit time function demonstrates an intermittency of
smooth curves and complicated structures that cannot be
resolved in principle, no matter how large the magniﬁca-
tion factor. The middle and low panels in FIG. 2a show
successive magniﬁcations of the function for the small in-
tervals, 86.7 6 ρ0 6 88.3 and 87.3292 6 ρ0 6 87.3463,
respectively. Further magniﬁcations reveals a self-similar
fractal-like structure that is typical for Hamiltonian sys-
tems with chaotic scattering [7, 8]. The length of the
T (ρ0) function L =

The exit time T , corresponding to both smooth and un-
resolved ρ0 intervals, increases with increasing the mag-
niﬁcation factor. It follows that there exist atoms never
reaching the detectors inspite of the fact that they have
no obvious energy restrictions to leave the cavity. Tiny
interplay between chaotic external and internal dynam-
ics prevents these atoms from leaving the cavity. The

similar phenomenon in chaotic scattering is known as dy-
namical trapping. Diﬀerent kinds of atomic trajectories,
which are computed with the system (2), are shown in
FIG. 1b. A trajectory with the number m transverses
the central node of the standing-wave before being de-
tected m times and is called m-th trajectory. There
are also special separatrix-like mS-trajectories following
which atoms in inﬁnite time reach the stationary points

πn (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), ρ = 0, transversing m times
the central node. These points are the anti-nodes of

onant system (δ = 0) with the initial atomic momen-
tum ρcr, a detuned atom can asymptotically reach one
of the stationary points after transversing the central
node m times. The smooth ρ0 intervals in the ﬁrst-order
structure (FIG. 2a, upper panel) correspond to atoms
transversing once the central node and reaching the right
detector. The unresolved singular points in the ﬁrst-
order structure with T =
at the border between the
∞
smooth and unresolved ρ0 intervals are generated by the
1S-trajectories. Analogously, the smooth and unresolved
ρ0 intervals in the second-order structure (FIG. 2a, mid-
dle panel) correspond to the 2-nd order and the other
trajectories, respectively, with singular points between
them corresponding to the 2S-trajectories and so on.

There are two diﬀerent mechanisms of generation of
inﬁnite detection times, namely, dynamical trapping
) in a cavity and the
with inﬁnite oscillations (m =

separatrix-like motion (m
). The set of all initial
=
momenta generating the separatrix-like trajectories is a
countable fractal. Each point in the set can be speciﬁed
as a vector in a Hilbert space with m integer nonzero com-
ponents. One is able to prescribe to any unresolved inter-
val of m-th order structure a set with m integers, where
the ﬁrst integer is a number of a second-order structure
to which trajectory under consideration belongs in the
ﬁrst-order structure, the second integer is a number of a
third-order structure in the second-order structure men-
tioned above, and so on. Such a number set is analogous
to a directory tree address: ”<a subdirectory of the root
directory>/<a subdirectory of the 2-nd level>/<a sub-
directory of the 3-rd level>/...”. Unlike the separatrix
fractal, the set of all initial atomic momenta leading to
seems to be
dynamically trapped atoms with m =

To emphasize that generation of atomic fractals of the
type considered above is generic in cavity QED, we have
treated two commonly used models of the chaotic atom-
photon interaction with a far detuned amplitude- and
phase-modulated standing wave [9, 10, 11, 12]. For suf-
ﬁciently large detuning,
1, one can adiabatically
eliminate the excited-state amplitudes of atoms initially
prepared in their ground states and neglect the eﬀects
of spontaneous emission. It is easy to show that the full
atom-ﬁeld dynamics (2) is reduced to the center-of-mass
atomic motion in a far detuned modulated optical stand-
ing wave. For suﬃciently large N
1, one have in-
stead of the fourth equation in the set (2) the expression
0 which we use to substi-
˙v/2N
tute u in the second equation. It leads to a dimension-
less eﬀective Hamiltonian for the center-of-mass motion

we have computed exit times T (ρ0) of cold atoms in
a far detuned amplitude-modulated standing wave with
sin βτ and g(τ ) = 1, where β = ωm/Ω0
f (τ ) = 1
is the modulation frequency. The respective fractal is
shown in FIG. 2b with β = 0.07, δ = 16, and the same
other parameters as in FIG. 2a. In a far detuned ﬁeld,
optical potential wells are shallow, and the ﬁrst singu-
larity of T (ρ0) occurs at small values of initial momen-
tum, ρ0
2. As well, we have found an atomic fractal
in a phase-modulated standing wave with f (τ ) = 1 and
g(τ ) = 1
∆ sin γτ , where ∆ and γ are a normalized
modulation depth and a frequency, respectively.

In summary, fractals in single-atom standing-wave cav-
ity QED typically arise in the nonlinear models of the
atom-ﬁeld interaction which are chaotic in the semiclassi-
cal limit. It has been shown as for the time independent
Hamiltonian system (2) with three degrees of freedom
(the ﬁeld, external, and internal atomic ones), as for the
time dependent system (4) with one and half degrees of
freedom describing the nonlinear atomic motion in a far
detuned amplitude- or phase-modulated cavity standing
ﬁeld. The fractals of the type to be found in this Let-
ter should appear also in the center-of-mass motion of an
ion conﬁned in a Paul trap and interacting with a laser
ﬁeld [13]. Diﬀerent eﬀective Hamiltonians have been in-
troduced to describe this interaction. The simplest one
[14] is of a harmonically driven linear oscillator which is
chaotic in the classical limit [15].

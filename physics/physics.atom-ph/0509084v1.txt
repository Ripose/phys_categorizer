We have measured the Stark shift of the A2Π1/2 − X 2Σ+ transition in YbF. We use a molecular
beam triple resonance method, with two laser transitions acting as pump and probe, assisted by an rf
transition that tags a single hyperﬁne transition of the X state. After subtracting the known ground
state Stark shift, we obtain a value of 70.3(1.5) Hz/(V/cm)2 for the static electric polarizability of
the state A2Π1/2(J = 1
2 , f ). From this we calculate a value µe = 2.46(3) D for the electric dipole
moment of the A2Π1/2(v = 0) state.

PACS numbers: 33.15.Kr,33.20.Kf

Although the Yb atom is a lanthanide, its closed shell
[Xe]4f 146s2 structure resembles that of an alkaline earth.
The gross features of YbF therefore bear a strong sim-
ilarity to those of CaF, SrF and BaF, but with a large
spin-orbit interaction and with some of its excited states
perturbed by low-lying open f -shell conﬁgurations. Thus
the YbF molecule occupies a special position, more com-
plicated than simple alkaline earth ﬂuorides, but simpler
than the other lanthanide ﬂuorides. YbF is also signiﬁ-
cant from a very diﬀerent point of view. It is an extraor-
dinarily sensitive system in which to detect a permanent
electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron and hence
to search for new interactions beyond the standard model
of elementary particle physics [1, 2].

Previous studies of the X 2Σ+ ground state in YbF
[3, 4] give precise values for the spin-rotation and hy-
perﬁne constants and for the electric dipole moment
µe = 3.91(4) D. The ﬁrst electronically excited state is
A2Π1/2 [5, 6]. In this state there is a strong perturba-
tion of the v = 1 level by the nearby [18.6]0.5(v = 0),
but A2Π1/2(v = 0) is relatively unperturbed. This spec-
troscopy opened the way to a ﬁrst measurement of the
electron EDM using YbF [2]. As part of the improve-
ment towards a second, much more sensitive EDM mea-
surement, we have now determined the electric dipole
moment µe of the unperturbed A2Π1/2(v = 0) state.

Our source of YbF molecules is a molybdenum cru-
cible heated resistively by a tungsten ribbon to
1500 K
and loaded with four parts by mass of Yb metal pieces
to one part aluminum ﬂuoride powder. Reactions within
the vapour form YbF molecules, which eﬀuse through a
slit in the oven and are collimated by two baﬄes. This
beam propagates in a vacuum chamber, pumped to a base
7 mbar by two turbo-molecular pumps.
pressure of
In YbF, the electronic ground state X 2Σ+ and the ﬁrst
excited state A2Π1/2 are connected by an optical transi-
tion at 553 nm. Two laser beams aligned perpendicular
to the molecular beam, the pump and the probe, are
used to excite and detect this transition. In the vibra-
tional and rotational ground state X 2Σ+(v = 0, J = 1/2)
of the 174YbF isotopomer there are two hyperﬁne levels,
F = 0 and F = 1, separated by 170.2540(4) MHz [4].
This structure is due to the magnetic coupling of the spin-
rotational angular momentum J = 1/2 with the ﬂuorine

nuclear spin of 1/2. When the pump laser (Coherent
699) is tuned into resonance with one of these hyperﬁne
states, the population of that state is pumped out. The
eﬀect is monitored downstream through ﬂuorescence in-
duced by the probe laser (Spectra Physics 380D), which
has a ﬁxed frequency tuned to excite the F = 1 ground
state. When we pump the F = 1 molecules the probe
signal decreases, whereas F = 0 pumping increases the
ﬂuorescence because some of these molecules are pumped
into the F = 1 ground state.
The Stark shift of the A

X transition is observed by
−
applying a uniform electric ﬁeld in the pump region using
rectangular gold-coated aluminium plates 13 mm thick,
70 mm wide and 60mm long with a spacing of 11.85
±
0.02 mm. This capacitor is located
150 mm from the
source, where the shadow of the molecular beam baﬄes
prevents direct deposition of material from the source
onto the ﬁeld plates. A potential diﬀerence of up to 6 kV
is applied across the plates. The leakage current is less
than 3 nA.

We focus our attention on the Q(0) line of the 174YbF

are complicated by nearby lines involving higher rota-
tional states of other isotopomers, primarily 172P(8) and
176P(9) [4], which move through the 174Q(0) spectrum of
interest as the electric ﬁeld is varied. In order to sup-
press these extraneous lines, we use a 170 MHz rf loop
downstream from the capacitor to drive the F = 0

magnetic hyperﬁne transition. When switched on and
oﬀ, this ﬁeld has no eﬀect on the background lines, but
it modulates the lines of interest. A Q(0) spectrum free
of backgrounds is therefore obtained by taking the dif-
ference ∆I between probe signals with the rf on and oﬀ.
Figure 1 shows two such diﬀerence spectra, one with the
static electric ﬁeld oﬀ and the other with it turned on.

In ﬁg. 1(a), the lower graph shows ∆I in thousands
of photomultiplier counts per second as the pump laser
scans through the Q(0) line in zero electric ﬁeld. This rf
on-oﬀ diﬀerence rises to nearly 10, 000 counts per sec-
ond when the pump laser excites the F = 1 ground
state. This changes to
5000 when the F = 0 state
is excited, the weaker intensity being due primarily to
the smaller statistical weight of the F = 0 state. The

width of the line is due mainly to power broadening. A
small part of the pump beam is split oﬀ and transmitted
through a confocal optical cavity of free spectral range
0.2 MHz. The upper trace shows a photodiode

signal recording the transmission fringes of this cavity.
The line through the reference cavity data points is a ﬁt
to the standard Airy function spectrum of a Fabry-Perot
resonator, which calibrates the laser scan with suﬃcient
accuracy for our purposes. The drift of the reference
cavity is negligible over the duration of the scans. Fig-
ure 1(b) shows the shifted molecular spectrum in a ﬁeld
of 4.1 kV/cm, together with the corresponding reference
cavity spectrum. Each of the two Q(0) spectra is ﬁt-
ted to the diﬀerence of two Lorentzians, whose widths,
heights and central frequencies are the ﬁtting parame-
ters. The F = 0 and F = 1 centres are constrained to
diﬀer by the known ground-state hyperﬁne splitting [4],
which does not shift appreciably. The 2.5(7) MHz hyper-
ﬁne splitting of the upper state [6] is also small enough
to neglect.

This experiment has been repeated for several electric
ﬁeld values, with results that are summarized in table I.

is the Stark shift of the X state alone, which is known
with 1% uncertainty from the spectroscopy of Sauer et
al.
[4]. This shift is almost entirely scalar since a pure
J = 1/2 state cannot have any tensor polarizability. A
hyperﬁne-induced admixture of higher rotational states
does lead to a tensor splitting between the mF = 0 and
mF =
1 components of F = 1 [4], but this splitting is
only 1.1 MHz at the highest ﬁeld used in our experiment
and is therefore too small to be important here. The
shifts δfX given in table I are for the F = 0 level, and are
the same as those for the centre of gravity of the F = 1
multiplet. The fourth column gives the shifts δfA of the
upper state alone, derived from the measured spectral
shifts by adding the ground-state shifts. The uncertainty
is mainly dominated by uncertainty in the ground-state
shifts. Being another J = 1/2 state, this upper level also
has a simple scalar Stark shift.

Figure 2 shows δfA versus the square of the electric
ﬁeld, which ﬁts well to the simple quadratic form δfA =
2 αE2. The error bars show only the measurement er-
−
ror, and not the systematic error from the uncertainty
in the ground-state shift. This systematic uncertainty is
properly accounted for after the ﬁt. The polarizability
thus determined is α = 70.3(1.5) Hz/(V/cm)2. From this
we can derive the dipole moment of the A2Π1/2(v = 0)
state.

contributing to this polarizability are the strongly mixed
A2Π1/2(v = 1) and [18.5]0.5(v = 0) [6], which are 15 THz
away. These make less than a 0.1% contribution and
are therefore neglected. Similarly, we neglect contri-
butions from the even more distant A2Π3/2 states and
from other conﬁgurations. The dipole moment µe in
units of Hz/(V/cm) is found by equating this calculated

polarizability with the measured value α. Converting
to more conventional Debye units, we obtain the result
µe = 2.46(3) D.

The ground-state electric dipole moments of group
IIA monoﬂuorides are reasonably well described by a
very simple ionic bonding model [4, 9], in which µe =
(µM + µF ). Here µ0 = Ree is due to the charges
µ0
of the ions (Re being the internuclear distance) and is
directed towards the metal, while µM and µF in the op-
posite direction are dipole moments induced in each ion
by the other. Using the same model now in the A2Π1/2
state of YbF, where µ0 = 9.6 D, our measurement gives
µe = 7.1 D, which is substantially larger than the
µ0
X-state value of 5.8 D [4].
It is most natural to asso-
ciate this with an increase in µM due to the larger size
of the valence orbital in the A-state, since one would not
expect the polarization of the F− ion to be very diﬀer-
ent, nor should there be a large contribution from the
tightly-bound 4f electrons. In order to check this intu-
itive picture, Titov and Mosyagin have embarked on an
ab-initio calculation that has yielded preliminary values
of 7.7(8) D and 5.9(6) D for µ0
µe in the A-state and
X-state respectively[10]. They can already conﬁrm that
the A-state and X-state dipole moments diﬀer mainly in
the polarization of the valence electron and by approx-
imately the amount that we observe. A more accurate
result is currently being calculated.

New Evaluation of Proton Structure
Corrections to Hydrogen Hyperﬁne
Splitting

Carl E. Carlson

Abstract: We consider the proton structure corrections to hydrogen ground-state hyperﬁne
structure, focusing on a state-of-the-art evaluation of the inelastic nucleon corrections—the
polarizability corrections—using analytic ﬁts to the most recent data. We ﬁnd a value for
the fractional correction ∆pol of 1.3 ± 0.3 ppm. This is 1–2 ppm smaller than the value of
∆pol one would deduce using hyperﬁne splitting data and elastic proton structure corrections
obtained from modern form factor ﬁts. In addition, we discuss the derivations of the relevant
formulas, paying attention to lepton mass effects and to questions surrounding the use of
unsubtracted dispersion relations.

1. Introduction

quency units [1],

Hyperﬁne splitting (hfs) in the hydrogen ground state is measured to 13 signiﬁcant ﬁgures in fre-

Ehfs(e−p) = 1 420.405 751 766 7(9) MHz .

(1)

This accuracy is especially remarkable to theorists, who are hopeful of obtaining calculations accurate
to a part per million (ppm) or so. We are close to reaching this goal, but some improvement is still
needed and there currently seems to be a few ppm discrepancy between the best calculations and the
data.

The main uncertainty in calculating the hfs in hydrogen comes from the hadronic, or proton struc-
ture, corrections. Calculation in this case is not ab initio calculation, which is currently impossible, but
rather calculations that relate proton structure contributions in the bound state energy to information
about proton structure obtained from elastic and inelastic electron-proton scattering measurements.
Historically, the elastic and inelastic contributions, the latter also called polarizability corrections have
often been treated separately, with the elastic corrections further divided into a nonrelativistic Zemach
term and relativistic recoil corrections. From a modern viewpoint, the elastic and inelastic corrections
should be treated as a unit since the sum lacks certain ambiguities that exist in the individual terms.

with mr = memp/(mp + me) being the reduced mass (and there are hadronic and muonic vacuum
polarization terms [2] which are included as higher order corrections to the Zemach term below). The
QED terms are accurately calculated and well known. They will not be discussed, except to mention
that could be obtained without calculation. The QED corrections are the same for muonium, so it is
possible to obtain them to an accuracy more than adequate for the present purpose using muonium hfs
data and a judicious subtraction [4, 5]. The weak interaction corrections [6] also will not be discussed,
and are in any case quite small. We will discuss the proton structure dependent corrections,

∆Str = ∆el + ∆inel = ∆Z + ∆p

R + ∆pol ,

where the terms on the right-hand-side are the Zemach, recoil, and polarizability corrections.

The proton structure corrections come from two-photon exchange, as diagramed in Fig. 1. Gener-
ically, the diagram consists of Compton scattering of off-shell photons from an electron knit together
with similar Compton scattering from the proton. (We are neglecting the characteristic momentum
of the bound electron. This allows a noticeably simpler two-photon calculation than for a scatter-
ing process [7]. One can show that keeping the characteristic momentum would give corrections of
O(αme/mp) smaller than terms that are kept [8].)

If the hadronic state represented as a blob in Fig. 1 is itself just a proton, the two-photon exchange
specializes to Fig. 2. The photon electron vertex is known, and we can calculate the diagram using [9,
10]

for the photon-proton vertex with incoming photon momentum q. The functions F1 and F2 are the
Dirac and Pauli form factors of the proton. They are measured in elastic electron-proton scattering, and
we shall refer to the contribution to the hyperﬁne energy from Fig. 2 as the elastic contribution.

One should know that using Eq. (5) is an approximation, because this form of the vertex is sufﬁcient
and correct only when both the proton entering and leaving the vertex are on mass-shell. However, if

one is able to do the box diagram calculation using an unsubtracted dispersion relation, the on-shell
parts of the elastic calculation are all that is needed. The story ﬁts nicely into the discussion surrounding
the derivation of the inelastic contributions, and we reserve its telling until we reach that discussion.
For now, we will just note that the ﬁnal sum of the inelastic and elastic proton structure corrections
includes terms precisely as derived from the above form of the photon-proton vertex.

The elastic contributions are separated as

R, also known as recoil corrections, won’t be displayed in this
talk because they are somewhat long (although not awful; see [9, 10]). An important point about them
is that they depend on the form factors and hence upon the proton structure. However, evaluating them
with different analytic form factors based on ﬁts to the scattering data reveals them to be decently well
determined by present standards.

When the blob in Fig. 1 is not a lone proton, we obtain inelastic contributions or polarizability
contributions [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].The inelastic contributions are not calculable ab initio. Instead,
one relates them to the amplitude for forward Compton scattering of off-shell photons off protons,

There are two structure functions H1 and H2 which depend on q2 and on the photon energy ν, deﬁned
in the lab frame so that mpν = p · q.

There is an optical theorem that relates the imaginary part of the forward Compton amplitude to
the cross section for inelastic scattering of off-shell photons from protons. The relations precisely are

Im H1(ν, q2) =

and

The integral for ∆1 is touchy. Only the second terms comes from the proceedrue just outlined;
it was historically thought convenient to add the ﬁrst term, and then subtract the same term from the
elastic contributions, speciﬁcally from the recoil corrections. This stratagem is what allows the electron
mass to be taken to zero in ∆1. The individual terms in ∆1 diverge (they would not had the electron
mass been kept), but the whole is ﬁnite because of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) [23, 24] sum

coupled with the observation that the auxiliary function β(τ ) becomes unity as we approach the real
photon point.

The polarizability expressions have some history. A short version is that considerations of ∆pol
were begun by Iddings in 1965 [12], improved by Drell and Sullivan in 1966[13], and given in present
notation by de Rafael in 1971 [14]. But no sufﬁcient spin-dependent data existed, so it was several
decades before the formula could be evaluated to a result incompatible with zero. In 2002, Faustov and
Martynenko became the ﬁrst to use g1,2 data to obtain results inconsistent with zero [16]. They got

5

(18)

∆pol = (1.4 ± 0.6) ppm

However, they only used SLAC data and ∆1 and ∆2 are sensitive to the behavior of the structure
functions at low Q2. Also in 2002 there appeared analytic expressions for g1,2 ﬁt to data by Simula,
Osipenko, Ricco, and Taiuti [25], which included JLab as well as SLAC data. They did not at that
time integrate their results to obtain ∆pol. Had they done so, they would have obtained ∆pol = (0.4 ±
0.6) ppm [17].

We now have enough information to discover a bit of trouble. Table 1 summarizes how things stood
before the 2005/2006 re-evalations of ∆pol. The sum of all corrections is 1.59±0.77 ppm short of what
would be desired by experimental data. Using the Simula et al. value for ∆pol would make the deﬁcit
greater. Using other proton form factor ﬁts (limitng ourselves to modern ones that ﬁt the data well) in
evaluating ∆Z can reduce the deﬁcit somewhat, but not by enough to ameliorate the problem [17].

Table 1. Corrections to hydrogenic hyperﬁne structure, as they could have been given in 2004. The ﬁrst line with
numbers gives the “target value” based on the experimental data and the best evaluation of the Fermi energy (8
ﬁgures) based on known physical constants. The corrections are listed next. (The Zemach term includes a 1.53%
correction from higher order electronic contributions [26], as well as a +0.07 ppm correction from muonic vacuum
polarization and a +0.01 ppm correction from hadronic vacuum polarization [2].) The total of all corrections is
1.59 ± 0.77 ppm short of the experimental value.

The discrepancy is not large, measured in standard deviations. On the other hand, the problem is
clearly not in statistical ﬂuctuations of the hfs measurement one is trying to explain, so one would like to
do better. As listed in the Table, the largest uncertainty in the corrections comes from ∆pol. Further, the
polarizability corrections require knowledge of g1 and g2 at relatively low Q2, and good data pressing
farther into the required kinematic regime has relatively recently become available from JLab (the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory, in Newport News, Virginia, USA). Accordingly,
we shall present a state-of-the-art evaluation of the polarizability correction for electronic hydrogen. To
give away our results [17] at the outset, we essentially conﬁrm (remarkably, given the improvements
in data) the 2002 results of Faustov and Martynenko.

Data for g1(ν, q2) has improved due to the EG1 experiment at JLab, which ran in 2005. Data based
on preliminary analysis is available [22]; ﬁnal data is anticipated in late 2006. A sample of the new

which differs from an integral appearing in ∆1 in lacking the auxiliary function. The integration was
done by the experimenters themselves. We remind the reader that this integral is expected to reach
the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn value −κ2
p at the real photon point, and that because of cancellations the
difference of this integral from −κ2
p is more relevant to the ﬁnal answer for ∆pol than its absolute
value.

All the data shown is new; there was no polarized electron-proton scattering data available below
Q2 = 0.3 GeV2 when Simula et al. and Faustov and Martynenko did their ﬁts. A curve obtained by
integrating Simula et al.’s ﬁt for g1 is also shown on the Figure; we do not have enough information to
produce a similar curve for Faustov and Martynenko’s ﬁt.

Integration in the region Q2 > 0.05 GeV2 is done using analytic ﬁts to actual data for g1. For Q2
below 0.05 GeV2, where there is no data, we do an interpolation based on a low Q2 expansion within
the integral to get (with Q2

We need to comment that for ∆2, we need g2, and there is almost no data for g2 on the proton.
One estimates g2 by relating it to g1 using the Wandzura-Wilczek relation [29], which we shall not
detail here. Fortunately, the auxiliary function β2(τ ) is small over the region where we need to do the
integrals, so that even when we assigned 100% error bars to the contribution from g2, the effect on the
ﬁnal answer was not great.

Our overall result is [17]

∆pol = 1.3 ± 0.3 ppm ,

which is similar to the Faustov-Martynenko result. This result means that the polarizability corrections
no longer give the largest uncertainty in Table 1. It also means that the theory deﬁcit outlined in Table 1
still remains, even becoming modestly larger with a smaller uncertainty limit, at (1.69 ± 0.57) ppm.

4. Comments on the derivations of the formulas

The polarizability corrections depend on theoretical results that are obtained using unsubtracted
dispersion relations. One would like to know just what this means, and since there is at least a small
discrepancy between calculation and data, one would like to be able to assess the validity of such
dispersion relations.

Also, the hyperﬁne splitting in muonic hydrogen may be measured soon. The polarizability correc-
tions have been calculated for this case also [30], albeit only with older ﬁts to the structure function
data and the relevant formulas, with non-zero lepton mass everywhere, are available [30] from a single
source, so one would like to verify these formulas. It turns out that keeping the lepton mass does not
greatly increase calculational effort or the length of the formulas, so we can do the groundwork for the
muonic hfs case simultaneously with the assessment of the ordinary hydrogen hfs calculation, although
we shall not here display the formulas for non-zero lepton mass.

The calculation begins by writing out the loop calculation using the known electron vertices and
the deﬁnition of the Compton scattering amplitudes involving H1 and H2 as given in Eq. (10). One
can and should use this formalism for all the hadronic intermediate states, including the single proton
intermediate states. The single proton intermediate states give contributions to H1 and H2 that can be
(more-or-less) easily calculated given a photon-proton-proton vertex such as Eq. (5). For reference, we
give the result for H1,

p (cid:19)

If one is calculating only the “elastic terms,” one can use the result for H el

1 directly in the loop
calculation and obtain a result [9] that one may call ∆el. All terms in H el
1 will contribute, speciﬁcally
including the F 2
2 term clearly visible above. A criticism of this procedure is that the proton vertex used
is not demonstrably valid when the intermediate proton is off shell, so the above expression may or
may not be correct overall. However, it is correct at the proton pole.

Alternatively, one may do a uniﬁed calculation of the elastic and inelastic contributions. Since
we don’t have a direct calculation of the Hi for the inelastic case, we obtain them using dispersion
relations. Including the elastic terms in the dispersion relation is no problem [12, 13]. One just needs
the imaginary parts of H el
i ; these are easy to obtain, and contain Dirac delta-functions that ensure the
elastic scattering condition ν = ±Q2/(2mp).

c(cid:13)2008 NRC Canada

8

unknown Vol. 99, 2008

Dispersion relations involve imagining one of the real variables to be a complex one an then using
the Cauchy integral formula to ﬁnd the functions Hi at a particular point in terms of an integral around
the boundary of some region. In the present case we “disperse” in ν, treating q2 as a constant while we
do so. Three things are needed to make the dispersion calculation work:

• The Cauchy formula and knowing the analytic structure of the desired amplitudes.

• The optical theorem, to relate the forward Compton Im Hi to inelastic scattering cross sections.

• Legitimately discarding contributions from some ∞ contour, if the dispersion relation is to be

“unsubtracted.”

The ﬁrst two are not in question.

For the present case, the contour of integration is illustrated in Fig. 4, where one should imagine

the outside circle having inﬁnite radius. The result for H1 begins its existence as

The numerator of the ﬁrst term is the residue (Res) from the poles in ν for the elastic part of H1,
1 , Eq. (24), is constant in ν, certainly lacking a pole in ν.
2 term arises from the elastic contribution,

as from Eq. (24). Note that the F 2
Hence this term never enters the dispersion relation, and no F 2

The second term leads to the g1 term in the quantity ∆1 given earlier, after using the optical theorem

to relate Im Hi to g1.

The third term is the integral over the part of the contour which is the inﬁnite radius circle. The
commonly quoted results for ∆pol, which appear in this talk, depend on dropping this term. The term
is zero, if H1 falls to zero at inﬁnite |ν|. Assuming this is true, however, appears to be a dramatic
assumption. It fails for H el
1 alone. Hence, for the assumption to succeed requires an exact cancelation
between elastic and inelastic contributions (or a failure of Eq. (24) on the big contour). On the positive
side are several considerations. One is that nearly the same derivation gives the GDH sum rule, which
is checked experimentally and works, within current experimental uncertainty (8%) [31]. Also, the
GDH sum rule has been checked in lowest order and next-to-lowest order perturbation theory in QED,
where it appears to work [32, 33]. Finally, Regge theory suggests the Compton amplitude does fall to
zero with energy [34], as one would like, although Regge theory famously gave wrong high ν behavior

for spin-independent analogs of g1 and g2 [35]. Hence there are indications, though not decisive proof,
supporting the unsubtracted dispersion relation.

The derivation ﬁnishes by subtracting a term involving F 2

2 from the relativistic recoil term, so as
to obtain exactly the elastic corrections ∆el = ∆Z + ∆p
R that were obtained (say) by Bodwin and
Yennie for a calculation of the elastic terms only, using Eq. (5) at the photon-proton vertices and no
dispersion theory [9]. After adding the same term to the polarizability corrections in ∆1, one obtains
the commonly quoted result for ∆1 [13, 14, 16]. As noted earlier, this reorganization also allows ∆1
to be ﬁnite in the me → 0 limit. Beyond the historical connection, if one is comfortable with the
unsubtracted dispersion relation, the use of the dispersion theory gives a more secure result because it
uses only the pole part of the photon-proton-proton vertex, so that the combined elastic and inelastic
result does not depend on the general validity of whatever photon-proton-proton vertex one uses.

5. Conclusion

The evaluation of the polarizability contributions to hydrogen hyperﬁne structure, ∆pol, based on
latest proton structure function data is ∆pol = 1.3 ± 0.3 ppm. This is quite similar to the Faustov-
Martyenko result, which we think is remarkable given the improvement in the data upon which it is
based. Most of the calculated ∆pol comes from integration regions where the photon four-momentum
squared is small, Q2 < 1 GeV2.

There is still a modest discrepancy between the hydrogen hfs calculation and experiment, on the
order of 2 ppm. Where may the problem lie? It could be in the use of the unsubtracted dispersion
relation; or it could be in the value of the Zemach radius, which taken at face value now contributes the
largest single uncertainty among the hadronic corrections to hfs; or perhaps it is a low Q2 surprise in
g1 or g2. We would like to know. It is at any rate not a statistical ﬂuctuation in the hfs data itself.

An interplay between the ﬁelds of atomic and nuclear or particle physics may be relevant to sorting
out problem. For one example, the best values of the proton charge radius currently come from small
corrections accurately measured in atomic Lamb shift [36]. The precision of the atomic measurement of
the proton charge radius can increase markedly if the Lamb shift is measured in muonic hydrogen [37],
which could happen in 2007, if the Paul Scherrer Institute accelerator schedule holds. In the present
context, the charge radius is noticed by its effect on determinations of the Zemach radius.

For ourselves, a clear continuation of the present program is to ﬁnish evaluations of the muonic
hydrogen ground state hfs. We have the formulas with all lepton masses in place, and are currently
waiting until the ﬁnal EG1 data is released, which we think will be rather soon, before publishing with
a numerical evaluation.

My contributions to this subject have all been made in collaboration with Vahagn Nazaryan and
Keith Grifﬁoen. I thank them for the great pleasure I have had working alongside them. In addition,
we thank Jos´e Goity, Savely Karshenboim, Ingo Sick, Silvano Simula, and Marc Vanderhaeghen for
helpful discussions and information. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation

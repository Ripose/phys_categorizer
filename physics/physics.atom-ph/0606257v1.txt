Larmor preession of laser-polarized atoms ontained in anti-relaxation-oated ells, deteted

via nonlinear magneto-optial rotation (NMOR) is a promising tehnique for a new generation of

ultra-sensitive atomi magnetometers. For magneti (cid:28)elds direted along the light propagation

diretion, resonanes in NMOR appear when linearly polarized light is frequeny- or amplitude-

modulated at twie the Larmor frequeny. Beause the frequeny of these resonanes depends on

the magnitude but not the diretion of the (cid:28)eld, they are useful for salar magnetometry. New

NMOR resonanes at the Larmor frequeny appear when the magneti (cid:28)eld is tilted away from the

light propagation diretion in the plane de(cid:28)ned by the light propagation and polarization vetors.

These new resonanes, studied both experimentally and with a density matrix alulation in the

present work, o(cid:27)er a onvenient method for NMOR-based vetor magnetometry.

It ours when Ωm is a subharmoni

Higher-order e(cid:27)ets involve quantum beat frequenies at

other multiples of ΩL [4℄. The width of the resonane be-

Although the magnetometri method based on FM

NMOR enables sensitive measurements of the magneti

(cid:28)eld, the measurements are salar, i.e., the position of a

given resonane depends only on the magnitude, and not

the diretion, of the magneti (cid:28)eld. However, the relative

magnitudes of the FM NMOR resonanes an depend on

the magneti (cid:28)eld diretion. Thus, a detailed analysis of

the FM NMOR signal ould give some information about

the diretion of the magneti (cid:28)eld. Towards this end, we

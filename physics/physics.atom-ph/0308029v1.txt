Abstract

Magnetic moments of free and bound deuteron and triton are considered and new
results for their magnetic moments (in units of that of the proton) and their g
factors are presented. We report on a measurement with medium-pressure hydrogen
deuteride (HD) at 10 atm, which is to be compared with the previous measurement
done at 100 atm. We conﬁrm that the high pressure used in former experiments
caused no systematic eﬀects at a level of 10 ppb. We also reexamined a theoretical
uncertainty related to screening eﬀects in HD and HT molecules and found that
previously it was underestimated. The medium-pressure result obtained for the free
deuteron µd/µp = 0.307 012 206 5(28) with a fractional uncertainty of 9.1·10−9 is free
of systematic eﬀects related to former high-pressure experiments. The reevaluated
result for triton is µt/µp = 1.066 639 908(10) with a fractional uncertainty of 9.3 ·
10−9.

Magnetic moments of light nuclei have been accurately studied for quite a
while. Their studies play an important role since they contribute to several
high-precision measurements. First, to determine a magnetic moment of a
given object (particle, nucleus etc.) via a measurement of the spin precession
frequency, one has to use some known magnetic moment and light nuclei sup-
ply us with such data (see e.g. the compilation [1,2,3]). Second, to determine
the ﬁne structure constant α, one can measure a gyromagnetic ratio of some
nucleus with a value of the magnetic moment known in units of the nuclear
magneton or Bohr magneton (see e.g. original results on the gyromagnetic

ratio of proton [4], helion [5] and reviews [6,7] for detail). Recently magnetic
moments of light nuclei (A ≤ 3) were in part revisited [8] to take into account
higher-order binding eﬀects and some new experimental data related to the
nuclear magneton value. Here we continue our reexamination of existing data
and present a new measurement of the deuteron magnetic moment.

Studies of the deuteron magnetic moment are of particular interest since this
is the simplest nucleus which consists of more than one nucleon. The most
accurate results on the magnetic moment of the proton [9] and deuteron [10]
adopted in [7] and recommended by CODATA are based on MIT experiments
with hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms with a maser. The energy levels studied
were split by the magnetic ﬁeld. Because of the signiﬁcance of the MIT results,
an independent determination of the ratio of proton-to-deuteron magnetic
moments is of crucial importance. The magnetic moment of deuteron (proton)
can be determined in one of the following ways:

• from the splitting of the 1s sublevels in deuterium (hydrogen) as it was done

at MIT with an uncertainty at a level of a part in 108 [9,10];

• by measuring a spin precession frequency of a free deuteron (proton) as it
was done for a proton with an uncertainty not better than a part in 107 for
a number of cases (mainly to calibrate the magnetic ﬁeld while measuring
magnetic moments of other objects);

• by studying a spin precession frequency related to proton and deuteron for

a HD molecule as we discuss in detail here.

The magnetic resonance spectroscopy of H2, D2 and HD to determine the
magnetic moments of proton and deuteron as well as the deuteron electric
quadrupole moment was ﬁrst applied in [11] about sixty years ago. Later,
important advantages of the application of a HD molecule for determination of
µp/µd were pointed out by Ramsey [12]. A description of the NMR spectrum
of HD can be found in detail in e.g. [13]. The results of early experiments
performed about ﬁfty years ago are discussed in [14]. Since that time the
accuracy has been substantially improved and is now claimed to be at a level of
a few ppb. However, the most accurate molecular experiments on HD [15,16,17]
and HT [18] have not been considered in Ref. [8] following the statement of
[7] on their unclear uncertainty, while they were used in other compilations
[1,2,3,6]. The earlier molecular experiments (see e.g. [19]) are less accurate and
are not competitive.

We believe that potentially the quoted experiments can provide us with the
most accurate data and intend to clarify their uncertainty. Here we reconsider
theoretical and experimental uncertainties related to the NMR spectroscopy
of molecular hydrogen and its isotopic modiﬁcations and report on the new
experimental result for hydrogen deuteride. A crucial level of accuracy is a
part in 108 which is needed to verify the results of the MIT experiments [9,10]

2

and our goal is to reach at least this level.

In NMR experiments on molecular hydrogen and its isotopes performed in
1975–1989 [15,16,17,18] several quantities were determined with an extremely
high accuracy: µp(H2)/µp(HD), µd(HD)/µd(D2), µd(HD)/µp(HD), µt(HT)/µp(HT).
The claimed uncertainty was at a level of a few parts in 109. A signal related
to µp(H2) in the tritium experiment [18] was also observed, however, the value
of µp(H2)/µp(HT) was not determined since the pure hydrogen signal was
subtracted and the data are not available any longer.

The experiments [16,17,18] were performed at a high pressure of approximately
107 Pa (100 atm) and often with a sample rotation. The purpose of this paper
is to check whether rotation and high pressure aﬀect the results. The exper-
iment reported here is performed on HD and D2 molecules at a pressure of
106 Pa (10 atm) without a sample rotation. We also reexamine a theoreti-
cal uncertainty appearing due to the interpretation of the proton-to-deuteron
ratio at molecular HD in terms of those for free nuclei.

The most important results of the high-pressure experiments [15,16,17,18] are
summarized in Table 1, which contains all reliable data. The ratio of nuclear
magnetic moments is easily related to measured NMR frequencies

where µ is the magnetic moment, I is the nuclear spin and f is the NMR
frequency. A value of the magnetic moment there is a bound one

µ(bound) = µ(free) · (cid:16)1 − σ(cid:17) .

The uncertainty in the calculation of the screening constant σ are discussed
separately below. A value of the NMR frequency f is the unweighted average
over the multiplet: a triplet for proton in HD, a doublet for deuteron in HD,
triton and proton in HT, a singlet for H2 and D2. The separation between the
lines within a multiplet is determined by the constant J related to the nuclear
spin-spin interaction (see e.g. [13]).

The measurements were taken at room temperature. The inﬂuence of the
rotational and vibrational structure on the screening constants was studied at
room temperature in [16].

During the experiment described in [15] the result on µd/µp was also derived,
however, later it was found to be contradicting to MIT data for a free proton

which has a fractional uncertainty of 1.5 · 10−8. A search for systematic eﬀects
led to understanding that commonly used techniques of separated inductance
coils for proton and deuteron resonance provide the excitation of proton and
deuteron transitions in slightly diﬀerent areas and due to an inhomogeneity of
the magnetic ﬁeld Eq. (2) is not valid any longer and the ratio of two NMR
frequencies is slightly diﬀerent from the ratio of the corresponding magnetic
moments. The systematic eﬀect was explained in the last paper of series [17],
however, a technique with a use of the same inductance for both resonances was
already applied in the experiments with triton [18] and helion [16]. However,
even after ﬁxing this systematic source, some other questions remain to be
clariﬁed. In particular, one has to check eﬀects due to a sample rotation, high
pressure and uncertainty of theory.

Eﬀects of the rotation were studied theoretically by Rabi, Ramsey and Schwinger
in [20] (see also [14]) who found that a particle in the rotated frame feels an
eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld diﬀerent from that in the rest frame. The value of the

4

diﬀerence depends on a gyromagnetic ratio of the particle and thus diﬀerent
particles see a somewhat diﬀerent eﬀective ﬁeld, so that Eq. (1) is not valid
any longer. The ratio of the spin precession frequencies is diﬀerent from that
containing the magnetic moments only. The eﬀective correction to the ﬁeld
is additive and proportional to the rotation frequency, which in the former
high-pressure experiments [15,16,17] was perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.
Hence the linear eﬀect in ωrot/ωNMR vanishes as long as the rotation axis is
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and only quadratic eﬀects, which are neg-
ligible, are present. However, a linear eﬀect in ωrot/ωNMR of the reduced value
could appear if the ﬁeld and the axis are not exactly perpendicular. The ro-
tation could also cause some mechanical and chemical problems. One of the
quoted high-pressure experiments [17] observed no shift of µp(HD)/µd(HD)
due to the rotation at a level of 6 · 10−9. In our experiment we also do not
apply any rotation.

To check the pressure dependence, we performed a medium-pressure exper-
iment at 10 atm results of which are reported here. This is approximately
tenfold reduction compared to previous high-pressure experiments done at a
pressure from 60 to 130 atm, with the most accurate results obtained at the
highest applied pressure. A higher pressure as well as rotation served well to
reduce a line width of NMR signals and in former high-pressure experiments
there was no overlap between lines within multiplets (a triplet for proton and
a doublet for deuteron in HD with a deuteron singlet from D2). In the present
experiment the lines within multiplets are overlapping.

Let us brieﬂy describe our experiment. We used a commercial NMR spectrom-
eter Bruker CXP 300 with a superconductive magnet producing the magnetic
ﬁeld of 7.05 T. The sample consisted of an external tube (#508-UP by Norell,
Inc.) and an internal capillary. The internal capillary was ﬁlled with gas of
HD and D2 at a pressure of 10 atm. The signal of the gas sample is relatively
weak and we need some time to collect reliable data. In our experiment the
measurement time was one hour. To simplify a calibration procedure, we ﬁlled
the external tube with acetone (CH3)2CO and deutero-acetone (CD3)2CO.

Acetone provides strong and narrow lines and we controlled the magnetic ﬁeld
by ﬁxing the position of the line of deutero-acetone

fd((CD3)2CO) = 46 072 631.58(1) Hz

and measured the acetone signal

fp((CH3)2CO) = 300 135 552.4(1) Hz .

At the next step we studied the proton triplet lines (see Fig. 1) shifted from

the acetone line by

∆fp = fp(HD) − fp((CH3)2CO) = 1 250.3(5) Hz

(6)

with the line separation within the triplet related to the hyperﬁne nuclear
spin-spin constant J(HD) and discussed below.

The other measurement was related to the deuteron lines (see Fig. 2). We
determined the NMR frequency of the deuteron HD doublet shifted from the
deutero-acetone line by

∆fd = fd(HD) − fd((CD3)2CO) = 198.8(4) Hz ,

(7)

with the line separation within the doublet determined by J(HD), and the
deuteron singlet line from D2 slightly shifted with respect to the center of the
deuteron doublet by approximately 2 Hz.

With these frequencies measured we arrive to a result

with a fractional uncertainty of 9 ppb. The uncertainty is mainly due to a line
ﬁtting procedure. The details will be published elsewhere [21]. We hope that
by improving statistics the errors due to the ﬁtting will be reduced.

singlet.

To check our results, we have performed several comparisons with previous
results, which are discussed below.

Acetone. The acetone ratio (fp/fd) is found to be in fair agreement with the
data previously obtained at a lower magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 T and 4.7 T with
rotation [22,23]. In the present experiment the acetone frequencies are related
to the position of the maximum of the lines, while for an interpretation in
terms of magnetic moments one has to separate the dominant proton and
deuteron modes and weak contributions related to molecules with incomplete
substitution of hydrogen for deuterium, (CD)3(CHD2)CO, which aﬀect the
maximum of stronger lines. Such a correction can be diﬀerent under diﬀerent
conditions and the ratio for the quoted proton and deuteron frequencies is not
exactly the same as the ratio of the proton and deuteron magnetic moments in
acetone molecules. In this paper we have not considered this small correction
because the acetone measurements were used for the normalization only and
the interpretation of the line maximum is not important for such a purpose.

Hyperﬁne interaction constant J(HD). The proton triplet should consist of
three Lorentzian lines separated by the same interval as the two lines of the
deuteron doublet related to the HD molecule (see Figs. 1 and 2). The sepa-
ration is equal to the hyperﬁne constant J(HD) (see e.g. [13]). The present
results are 41.8(17) Hz (from the proton spectrum) and 40.8(15) Hz which
both agree with a high-pressure result of 43.115(12) Hz [15] listed in Table 1.

Isotopic shift for deuteron. Simultaneous observation of the deuteron singlet
related to D2 and the deuteron HD doublet provides us with another test (see

7

Fig. 2). The result obtained is

µd(D2)
µd(HD)

= 1 − 45(7) × 10−9

(9)

which is less accurate but consistent with the high-pressure value of 1−42(2)×
10−9 [15].

All tests showed fair agreement with high-pressure results obtained applying a
sample rotation. The main result of this paper in Eq. (8) also agrees with the
high-pressure values listed in Table 1. The result (8) is more reliable than the
tests with the isotopic eﬀects and the hyperﬁne structure. The result (8) comes
from average frequencies of proton triplet and deuteron doublet which are
relatively immune to line-shape eﬀects. In contrast, diﬀerential characteristics
like the hyperﬁne separation inside the triplet and the doublet or the isotopic
shift of the center of gravity of the deuteron doublet with respect to the singlet
from D2 are sensitive to such eﬀects.

Theoretical calculations for shielding and hyperﬁne constants were started by
Ramsey [24,25]. Now they are substantially improved. We follow the exam-
ination in [18], however, we pay our attention to a proper estimation of the
uncertainty of the quoted calculation.

The result presented in paper [18] stated

σt(HT) − σp(HT) = 20.4 × 10−9 ,
σd(HD) − σp(HD) = 15.0 × 10−9 .

(10)
(11)

This result was derived as an evaluation of some matrix elements with the
wave functions related to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. All the per-
turbative operators to be averaged are of the order of α2(me/mp) in atomic
units.

The uncertainty of the calculation was not presented explicitly in [18] and the
ﬁnal results for deuteron and triton did not include any theoretical uncertainty.
However, at least two sources of uncertainties were mentioned by the authors
and we consider them here. Note that any detail in [18] is related to HT, while
here we concentrate on HD, and thence any contribution to the HD case is
multiplied by roughly 0.75 as explained in [18].

• The result [18] is a sum of eight terms. However, three of them were esti-
mated as being smaller than 4.5 · 10−10 each. An additional term discussed
there was estimated to be below than 1.5 · 10−10. Since no details on the
three terms are presented, we consider the missed terms as correlated and

8

estimate their sum as ±1.5 · 10−9 or approximately 10% of the value of
σd(HD) − σp(HD).

• The wave functions in [18] are related to the binding energy which is ap-
proximately 5% diﬀerent from a real one and due to that authors stated
that the uncertainty cannot be lower than 5%.

There may be some other sources due to the method of the calculation in
[18] which are beyond consideration in this paper. We hope to decrease the
experimental uncertainty for the ratio of the magnetic moments to a few ppb
and thus the theoretical calculations need to be substantially improved.

Here we estimate the uncertainty of the calculation in Ref. [18] as 15% and
thus the results (10) and (11) of [18] should be corrected to

σt(HT) − σp(HT) = 20(3) × 10−9 ,
σd(HD) − σp(HD) = 15(2) × 10−9 .

Due to the theoretical correction (13), the result (8) leads for a free proton
and deuteron:

µp(free)
µd(free)

=

µp(HD)
µd(HD)

× (cid:16)1 − [σd(HD) − σp(HD)](cid:17)

and

(12)

(14)

(15)

with a fractional uncertainty of 9 ppb, which agrees with both high-pressure
data and the maser result. We summarize results on determination of the
deuteron-to-proton ratio in Fig. 3.

Mixing diﬀerent gaseous substances, one can cancel systematic sources due
to macroscopic screening eﬀects, perturbations of electronic wave functions
etc. and to compare a given magnetic moment with a probe one. A promising
probe magnetic moment is that in molecular hydrogen, which is one of very
few atomic and molecular systems where the binding corrections to the nuclear
magnetic moment can be in principle calculated ab initio with a high accuracy.
In this way it is very important to have more experimental data. A study of
isotopic and hyperﬁne eﬀects is an important step towards theoretical under-
standing of the molecular screening eﬀects. Meanwhile, the comparison of the
proton-to-deuteron (and proton-to-triton) ratio of magnetic moments related

eﬀects essentially reduced. We have demonstrated that the high-pressure data
obtained for HD molecules are reliable and conﬁrmed them within the ac-
curacy of our experiment. We have also carefully investigated a theoretical
uncertainty which happens to be higher than a statistical uncertainty of the
former high-pressure experiments [17,18], but below the uncertainty of the
present medium-pressure experiment.

We list in Table 2 the results for deuteron obtained in the present paper and
the reexamined results for HT. We estimate the experimental HT uncertainty
by the uncertainty of the present medium-pressure experiment since no dis-
crepancy between medium-pressure and high-pressure data for HD has been

10

detected. The theoretical uncertainty is taken from (12). Even with the reesti-
mated and thus enlarged uncertainty the triton result obtained from HT is the
most accurate one (cf. [26,27]) and the deuteron result has approximately an
1.5 times lower uncertainty than the maser result (3) [9,10,7]. We consider our
experimental uncertainty here as rather somewhat overestimated and hope
to improve medium-pressure measurements. We note, however, that presently
the theory also substantially contributes to the uncertainty for the free mag-
netic ratio and further theoretical progress to obtain more reliable and more
accurate data is strongly needed.

Using a system consisting of a freely falling cloud of cold cesium atoms periodically kicked by pulses from
a vertical standing wave of laser light, we present the ﬁrst experimental observation of high-order quantum
accelerator modes. This conﬁrms the recent prediction by Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini [Phys. Rev. Lett.
89, 084101 (2002)]. We also show how these accelerator modes can be identiﬁed with the stable regions of
phase space in a classical-like chaotic system, despite their intrinsically quantum origin.

The search for signatures of chaos and stability in quantum
systems whose classical analogs can exhibit chaotic dynamics
is an area of intense current theoretical and experimental inter-
est. The motivation for such investigations is twofold. Firstly,
the study of the way in which complex classical behaviour has
its origin in the quantum regime helps in understanding the
operation of the quantum-classical correspondence principle
and thus the physical processes that are crucial in determining
observed macroscopic behaviour, particularly when this be-
haviour is unpredictable and chaotic. Secondly, the quantum
dynamics of such systems are of considerable interest in their
own right, especially when the systems behave in a peculiarly
non-classical manner.

The study of quantum chaos and stability has focused on
both energetic and dynamical properties of systems [1, 2, 3,
4]. Approaches to the classiﬁcation of quantum systems’ be-
haviour have ranged from the highly mathematical (e.g. trace
formulae [2]) through the statistical (energy spectra [3]) to the
more phenomenological (energy and momentum transfer to
ensembles of particles [4]).
It is the latter approach which
is most appealing as a philosophy to guide experimental in-
vestigations, and has underpinned the work presented in this
Letter. Resonant, stable behaviour in quantum systems often
depends on precise fulﬁlment of matching conditions between
periodic forcing of a system and its own natural frequency.
This is in stark contrast to the looser matching which is gener-
ally required in the corresponding classically chaotic system
[5]. The quantum resonances [6] observed in the δ-kicked ro-
tor [7, 8] represent an excellent example of this dichotomy
between the quantum and the classical. These resonances are
characterised by the steady transfer of momentum to the sys-
tem, which in the atom-optical case [9, 10] manifests itself as
a symmetric broadening of the atomic momentum distribution
for special values of the driving frequency of the potential.
This phenomenon is therefore interesting in terms of both the
motivations outlined above.

In this Letter, we report the results of experiments using
an atom-optical realization [11] of the δ-kicked accelerator
[12, 13, 14, 15]. This is realized when pulses from a vertical
standing wave of laser light are applied to freely falling laser-
cooled atoms. The Hamiltonian for this system is given by

which is related to the classically chaotic δ-kicked rotor by the
addition of a static linear potential. Here ˆz is the position, ˆp
the momentum, m the particle mass, g the gravitational accel-
eration, t the time, T the pulse period, G = 2π/λspat, where
λspat is the spatial period of the potential applied to the atoms,
and ~φd quantiﬁes the depth of this potential. The classical
dynamics of this system are qualitatively similar to those of
the δ-kicked rotor, whereas the quantum dynamics are quite
distinct. For example, the quantum accelerator modes recently
discovered in this system [12] are not observed in the corre-
sponding classical system. The modes are characterised by
the asymmetric transfer of a ﬁxed momentum impulse per
kick to approximately 20% of the initial ensemble of laser-
In a recent analysis of this phenomenon by
cooled atoms.
Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini (FGR) [5], quantum ac-
celerator modes were interpreted as being a resonant type of
behavior, closely related to the quantum resonances in the δ-
kicked rotor. This analysis also led to the fascinating predic-
tion of the existence of whole families of higher-order quan-
tum accelerator modes. These were shown to correspond to
higher-order ﬁxed points centered on systems of islands in a

ﬁrst experimental observation of these higher-order accelera-
tor modes, ﬁnding excellent quantitative agreement with the
analysis of Ref. [5].

The kicking potential acts on the atoms as a phase grating
that induces a phase modulation of amplitude φd to their de
Broglie waves. Hence the effect of a pulse on a plane wave
is to cause diffraction into a series of momentum states sepa-
rated by the grating recoil ~G. Between consecutive pulses
these states accumulate a phase related to their kinetic en-
ergy. This phase evolution is determined by the value of T ,
which will therefore govern the type of dynamics exhibited
by the system. As in Refs. [14, 15], we use scaled position
and momentum variables χ = Gz and ρ = GT p/m. An ef-
fective scaled, dimensionless Planck constant k = ~G2T /m
is then deﬁned through the relation k = −i[ ˆχ, ˆρ]. This pa-
rameter, together with φd and γ = gGT 2 (which accounts

for the effect of gravity) fully describe the quantum dynamics
of the δ-kicked accelerator. When quantum resonances occur
in the δ-kicked rotor (γ = 0), the phase difference accumu-
lated between momentum states separated by ~G from one
pulse to the next is equal to an integer multiple of 2π. For a
state of zero initial momentum, this is the case for values of
T corresponding to k = 4πℓ where ℓ ∈ Z. This rephasing is
analogous to the Talbot effect in optics [16], and so we speak
of these resonances as occurring at integer multiples of the
Talbot time TT = 4πm/~G2 [13]. For a continuous initial
distribution of momenta, such as in a cold atomic ensemble,
resonant behavior is observed for k = 2πℓ, i.e. at integer mul-
tiples of the half-Talbot time, T1/2 [9, 10, 14]. Close to these
values of T , quantum accelerator modes are found in the δ-
kicked accelerator [14].

In our experimental realization of the quantum δ-kicked ac-
celerator, about 107 caesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a
magneto-optic trap (MOT) to a temperature of 5µK, yielding
a Gaussian momentum distribution with FWHM 6~G. The
atoms are then released from optical molasses and, falling
freely under gravity, are exposed to pulses from a vertical
standing wave of off-resonant laser light that is 20 GHz red-
detuned from the 62S1/2 → 62P1/2, (F = 4 → F ′ = 3) D1
transition. Hence λspat = 447 nm and T1/2 = 66.7µs. The
intensity of the light in each pulse is approximately 1 × 108
W/cm2, and the duration of each pulse is 500 ns. Through the
action of the ac Stark shift, these pulses result in δ-function-
like applications of a spatially periodic potential to the atoms,
with φd = Ω2tp/8δL. Here Ω is the Rabi frequency, tp the
duration of each (square) pulse and δL the detuning from the
D1 transition. Both the trapped atom density distribution and
the standing light wave intensity proﬁle are Gaussian, with
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1 mm. The result-
ing mean value of φd is around 0.8π. After application of the
diffracting pulses, the atoms fall through a sheet of light res-
onant with the 62S1/2 → 62P3/2, (F = 4 → F ′′ = 5) D2
transition, located 0.5m below the point of release, and their
momentum distribution is measured by a time-of-ﬂight tech-
nique with a resolution of ∼ ~G. For more details regarding
our experimental setup see Refs. [13, 14, 15].

The approach used by FGR [5] accounts for the observed
acceleration of atoms participating in a quantum accelerator
mode in terms of stable ﬁxed points in a map for a classical
point particle. The validity of this map can be justiﬁed asymp-
totically by the closeness of k to integer multiples of 2π. The
pseudoclassical limit can be described by ǫ = (k − 2πℓ) → 0
(hence the description ‘pseudoclassical’), or equivalently by
(ℓ − T /T1/2) → 0. In an appropriately transformed frame
[5], the map is given by [15]

˜ρn+1 = ˜ρn − ˜k sin(χn) − sign(ǫ)γ,
χn+1 = χn + sign(ǫ)˜ρn+1,

(2)

(3)

where ˜ρ = ρǫ/k, and ˜k = φd|ǫ|. With the correct initial con-
ditions, iteration of Eqs. (2) and (3) yields systems of acceler-
ator orbits. These are stable ﬁxed points centered on islands in

2

the pseudoclassical phase space. To yield an observable quan-
tum accelerator mode an island system must be sufﬁciently
large, in terms of total phase-space area. Thus, in a classical
sense, the islands must encompass sufﬁcient phase space den-
sity for the accelerator mode to be measurable. Furthermore,
the islands must be large, or at least comparable to |ǫ| (which
takes the place of ~ as a measure of the size of a minimal
‘quantum phase space’ cell) for a point particle-like descrip-
tion of the quantum accelerator mode dynamics to be appro-
priate. We show in this Letter that when these requirements
are satisﬁed, the momentum gain predicted by the analysis of
FGR agrees very well with experiment, even when k is not
extremely close to a resonant value. This can be understood
as being due to the relevant dynamics taking place in stable
regions of the pseudoclassical phase space, where semiclas-
sical analyses can generally be expected to work reasonably
well [17].

FGR [5] classify accelerator orbits (and thus quantum ac-
celerator modes) by the order p of the ﬁxed point (i.e. how
many pulse periods it takes before cycling back to the initial
point in the reduced phase space cell) and the jumping index j
(related to how many units of the momentum period of phase
space are imparted to the accelerating atoms per cycle). Par-
ticles in a pseudoclassical (p, j) mode with an initial momen-
tum of q0~G have, after N kicks, a momentum (in units of
~G) given by

q ≃ q0 +

in a frame accelerating with gravity. Only atoms of certain
initial momenta will be accelerated [13]; ideal values of q0
and initial position can be determined analytically [5]. As our
molasses-cooled atomic ensemble extends over many phase
space cells, all such conditions can be satisﬁed. All atoms
fulﬁlling these conditions will receive the same momentum
transfer. Since the mean initial momentum is 0, the central
momentum of the observed accelerator mode is well described
by Eq. (4) with q0 = 0.

To search for high-order accelerator modes, we measured
the momentum distribution after a ﬁxed number of pulses for
a range of T in the vicinity of the ﬁrst three integer multi-
ples of T1/2. Figure 1 displays the experimental momentum
distributions after 30 pulses for values of T in the region of
(a) T1/2 (T = 60.5µs to 74.5µs), (b) TT = 2T1/2 (124.5µs
to 142.5µs), and (c) 3T1/2 (191.5µs to 209.5µs). The dotted
curves indicate the theoretical predictions of Eq. (4). There is
some disagreement for very large momenta, particularly large
negative momenta. At these momenta, the atoms have left the
Raman-Nath regime [14], and move so quickly that they travel
a signiﬁcant fraction of the standing wave period λspat during a
pulse. These atoms experience a spatially averaged potential,
so it is no longer appropriate to speak of δ-function-like kicks.
Such an effect will be stronger for atoms accelerated in the
negative direction (with gravity) than in the positive (against
gravity).

FIG. 1: Pseudocolor plots of the variation with T of the experimental
momentum distribution after 30 kicks, in a frame falling freely with
gravity. The value of T was varied around (a) T1/2, (b) TT = 2T1/2,
and (c) 3T1/2, in steps of 0.128µs. The overlaid dotted lines indi-
cate the predicted momenta [Eq. (4)] of selected quantum accelerator
modes, labelled by (p, j).

Certain of the more slowly accelerating (higher-order)
quantum accelerator modes can only be resolved after apply-
ing a larger number of pulses than used in Fig. 1. To ob-
serve the emergence of several such modes, the value of T
was scanned, for larger pulse numbers, in the region of TT.
Figure 2 shows the experimental momentum distributions af-
ter (a) 60, (b) 90, (c) 120, and (d) 150 pulses. Overlaid white
lines indicate the predictions of Eq. (4). In Fig. 2(a) we can
now identify the (13,-5) and (23,9) modes. After 90 kicks
[Fig. 2(b)] the (18,-7) accelerator mode is emerging, whereas
the momenta of the (2,1) and the (5,-2) modes have grown be-
yond the measurable range. In Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) the atoms
have received yet more momentum, and the (3,-1) mode is no
longer visible. Note also that some of the quantum accelera-
tor modes seem to ‘fade’ and become diffuse with time; this
effect is not predicted by the pseudoclassical model and may
be due to tunneling [5].

We now explicitly connect the experimentally observed
higher-order quantum accelerator modes around TT, as dis-
played in Figs. 1(b) and 2, with their corresponding island sys-
tems in pseudoclassical phase space. Figure 3 shows strobo-

tally observed quantum accelerator modes. Comparing Figs.
2 and 3, we see that the appearance and disappearance of the
quantum accelerator modes and of the stable island systems
as T is varied coincide. Figure 3(a) (T = 130.0µs) shows the
three large islands corresponding to the (3,-1) quantum accel-
erator mode. In Fig. 3(b) it is possible to observe the coexis-

resonance times. Linking this theory with our experiment, we
have successfully performed quantum accelerator mode spec-
troscopy. Conﬁrmation of the validity of such a theoretical
approach promises new avenues for investigation of quantum-
classical correspondence in a chaotic context. Furthermore,
the efﬁcient momentum transfer occurring in these atomic dy-
namics is of great intrinsic interest. We have recently demon-
strated quantum accelerator modes to be formed coherently
[15], and the simultaneous existence of quantum accelerator
modes in opposite momentum directions could be applied as
a beam-splitter for large-area atom interferometry [18].

The islands correspond to the following quantum accelerator modes:
(a) T = 130.0µs, and (p, j) = (3, −1); (b) T = 132.2µs,
(p, j) = (5, −2) (shorter, rounder islands) and (8,-3) (thin, elon-
gated islands); (c) T = 132.8µs, (p, j) = (13, −5); (d) T =
133.5µs, (p, j) = (23, 9); (e) T = 134.2µs, (p, j) = (5, 2); and
(f) T = 139.4µs, (p, j) = (2, 1). We have clustered the initial con-
ditions around the ﬁxed points corresponding to accelerator orbits to
highlight the structure of the island system of interest.

which can be seen to be consistent with the experimental re-
sults in Figs. 1(b) and 2(a). Interestingly, these yield simul-
taneous momentum transfer in opposite directions, promis-
ing application as a beam-splitting technique. Figure 3(c)
(T = 132.8µs) shows the emergence of a (13,-5) accelera-
tor orbit, while in Fig. 3(d) we see a complex (23,9) island
system at T = 133.5µs (just greater than TT). This neverthe-
less appears to correspond to a fairly robust quantum accel-
erator mode that is clearly visible in each of the subplots of
Fig. 2. Moving further away from TT, in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)
(T = 134.2µs and 139.4µs, respectively), we again observe
comparatively simple orbits, (5,2) and (2,1), respectively.

In conclusion, we have successfully observed a multitude of
quantum accelerator modes of up to 23rd order, and connected
them to the periodic orbits of a classical map. This was de-
rived by FGR [5] as a pseudoclassical limit of the underlying

Electron density and electron momentum density, while independently tractable experimentally,
bear no direct connection without going through the many-electron wave function. However, in-
voking a variant of the constrained-search formulation of density functional theory, we develop a
general scheme (valid for arbitrary external potentials) yielding decent momentum space properties,
starting exclusively from the coordinate- space electron density. Numerical illustration of the scheme
is provided for the closed-shell atomic systems He, Be and Ne and for 1s1 2s1 singlet electronic ex-
cited state for Helium by calculating the Compton proﬁles and the hpn
i expectation values derived
from given coordinate space electron densities.

For a quantum mechanical N-electron system such as
an atom, molecule or a solid, the coordinate space one-
electron density n(~r) is derived from the pertinent conﬁg-
uration space many-electron (antisymmetric) wave func-
tion Ψ(~r1, ~r2, ~r3, ..., ~rN ) through the marginal distribu-
|Ψ(~r, ~r2, ~r3, . . . , ~rN )|2d3r2d3r3 . . . d3rN
tion n(~r) = N
(electron spins may also be included). Analogously,
the one-electron momentum density γ(~p) is obtained
from the N-electron momentum space wave func-
tion Φ(~p1, ~p2, ~p3, . . . , ~pN ) via the reduction γ(~p) =
|Φ(~p, ~p2, ~p3, . . . , ~pN )|2d3p2d3p3 . . . d3pN . The wave
N
functions Ψ and Φ in the complementary spaces are con-
nected by a many-particle Fourier-Dirac transformation :

(Hartree atomic units, viz.
|e| = 1, me = 1, ¯h = 1 have
been used throughout). Experimentally, the coordinate-
space density is tractable through a coherent and elastic
x-ray scattering process [1] where the scattered intensity
2
is directly proportional to |f (~k)|
, f (~k) being the form
factor which is the Fourier transform of n(~r). On the
other hand, the electron momentum density γ(~p) man-
ifests itself more directly in terms of the (directional)
Compton proﬁle J(q) [2] obtained in an inelastic high
energy (X-ray or γ-ray) Compton scattering process :

where here and henceforth, the subscript “sph” will be
understood.

It must be emphasized here that the mappings n −→ Ψ
and γ −→ Φ are both in general one-many and although
for the ground state the former is unique [4], the ex-
plicit prescription for the map is unknown. Hence while
there exists a Fourier connection between Ψ ←→ Φ, no
such direct relation is possible between the densities n(~r)
and γ(~p) in the two complementary spaces. On the ba-
sis of quasi-classical phase-space considerations (akin to
the Thomas-Fermi theory), there exists a procedure due
to Burkhardt [5], K`onya [6], and Coulson and March
[7], called the BKCM scheme, to estimate electron mo-
mentum density, given its position-space counterpart [8].
However, this method is marred by its artifacts of a di-
vergent γ(0) and a ﬁnite cut-oﬀ for γ(p). Incidentally, the
so termed “Wigner function” [9, 10, 11] cannot represent
a joint probability in phase space for not being strictly
positive semideﬁnite. In their phase-space approach to
density functional theory (DFT) [4], Parr et al. [12] pre-
scribed a phase-space entropy maximization, imposing a
given coordinate density and a given kinetic energy den-
sity (at each point ~r) as constraints. This enabled them
to obtain a positive semideﬁnite phase-space distribution
through which momentum density could be extracted.

Let us, however, pose a question : Given exclusively
the electron density in coordinate space as a starting
point (and no other information), could one estimate the
quantum-mechanical electron momentum density (and

hence the Compton proﬁle)?

It is the spirit underlying this letter to demonstrate
an aﬃrmative answer to the above question, within the
density functional theory pertinent features of which have
been as highlighted below.

In their exciting work, Zhao and Parr (ZP) [13] devel-
oped a novel method to obtain the Kohn-Sham orbitals
for a given co-ordinate space density. Their method is
based on Levy’s constrained search approach [14] that
generalizes the Hohenberg - Kohn formulation of DFT.
Constrained search approach which obtains the Kohn-
Sham “wave function”, a single Slater determinant ΨD
formed out of the lowest occupied orbitals of a local po-
tential, by minimizing the non-interacting kinetic energy

Ts[n] = min
ΨD

< ΨD| ˆT |ΨD >,

(4)

where ΨD =⇒ n(~r), the given density; ˆT is the N-electron
kinetic energy operator and ΨD is an antisymmetric,
normalized (hence L2) N-electron wave function of in-
dependent electrons. ZP accomplished the search on the
right side of Eq.
(4) through variation of the orbitals
{ψi(~r)}N
i=1 yielding a density n(~r). This density would
equal the given density n0(~r) at every point ~r, via the
minimization of the positive semideﬁnite functional

whose minimum value zero would be reached iﬀ n(~r) =
n0(~r) ∀~r. The minimization Ts[n] + λC with respect to
the orbitals {ψi} gives a set of Kohn-Sham like equa-
tions :

in the limit λ → ∞, C → 0,

Kohn-Sham potential [13].

R

Morrison and Zhao [15] applied this method to atoms
while Ingamells and Handy [16] extended the work to
molecular systems. Recently, Harbola [17] observed that
the Zhao-Parr procedure could also be applied to obtain
Kohn-Sham orbitals for an excited-state density, thereby
demonstrating the general applicability of the method to
ground- as well as excited-states.

Our scheme to eﬀect n(~r) → γ(~p) “transformation”
is : Start from a given density n0(~r) ⇒ Obtain the
Kohn - Sham orbitals ψi(~r) via the Zhao - Parr pre-
i=1 | ψi(~r) |2 = n(~r) ⇒ Fourier transform
scription
i=1 | φi(~p) |2; hence
ψi(~r) −→ φi(~p) ⇒ Obtain γ(~p) =

tion values. This procedure thus starts from only a given
n0(~r) and estimates J(q) and hpni values. We illustrate

this “~r-density to momentum-space properties” (RDMP)
scheme for the following atomic systems :

Accurate coordinate space densities employed as start-
ing points for ground state are due to Koga et al.
[18]
for He, Esquivel and Bunge [19] and Bunge and Esquivel
[20] for Be and Ne respectively while the Coolidge and
James [21] density was used for He excited state. The
value of λ (cf. eq. 6 ) was set to ∼5000, leading to a
suﬃciently accurate self-consistent Kohn-Sham potential
converged to ﬁve places.

A collage of the γ(~p) derived from n(~r) under the
present scheme is depicted in Fig. 1. While all the γ-plots
compare extremely well with their HF-counterparts (not
shown), the features of nonmonotonicity of γ(~p) for Neon
is also reproduced (cf. Ref.
[22]; Fig. 1), in conformity
with the fact that atoms with their ultimate p-shells dou-
bly occupied or more evince such nonmonotonicity [22].
The Hartree-Fock data (zeroth-order correlated) for
the wave-function are given for comparison and as a da-
tum. Particularly striking is the fact that for excited He,
the electron momentum density (EMD) is overwhelm-
ingly preponderant around low momentum values along
with a very sharp asymptotic fall-oﬀ.

comparators. Each CP is normalized as
N/2, as is customary. There is a remarkable agreement
R
between the CP’s derived from coordinate space atomic
electron densities within the impulse approximation and
the Hartree - Fock (HF) or experimental CP’s. From Ta-
ble I, the considerable redistribution of electron momen-
tum density of He excited state in comparison with its
ground state counterpart is evident. Excitation brings
in a slower decay in the coordinate space which is, by
Fourier reciprocity, mapped on to a peak Compton pro-
ﬁle value. As the transition 1s1 2s1 → 1s2 is dipole-
forbidden, this singlet He-excited state is long-lived (life
time ∼ 1
10 sec); while there have been no Compton pro-
ﬁles (CP’s) reported for this system, the present scheme
accomplishes this.

For Be and Ne (Tables II and III) ground states, the
CP’s via the present schemes give better overall agree-
ment with their accurate correlated counterparts than do
the HF-CP’s. This is indicative of the correlation piece
picked up by the Zhao-Parr scheme.

To gauge the overall quality of the electron momen-
tum density “derived” from the coordinate space den-
sity, we have computed the hpni values under the RDMP
scheme and have compared with those derived from ac-
curate, correlated atomic wave functions [28], as well as
from the near Hartree-Fock wave functions [23]. Table IV
illustrates that the present RDMP scheme successfully
obtains the hpni values (for n = -2, -1, 1, 2, 3 and 4)
in agreement with both their HF and correlated counter
parts. For the case of He excited state, preponderance of
electron momentum density around very small as well as
large p values is conspicuous.

Since the Kohn - Sham theory, in its very spirit, pro-
vides an eﬀective local one- body potential in which
the mutually noninteracting electrons are immersed,
the quantal exchange-correlation eﬀects of the electron-

electron interactions (after ﬁltering out the “classical”
part
ef f (~r)) embody a ki-
netic energy like piece and a potential energy like piece.
The kinetic piece arises out of the diﬀerence between the
functionals T [n] and Ts[n], whose values albeit known,
their forms remain unknown. Lam and Platzman [30]
and Tong and Lam [26] imported the functional forms
for a homogeneous electron gas and estimated the cor-
rection to J(q) within the local density approximation.
In the present case however, the diﬀerence as a func-
tional cannot be isolated from the sum total Kohn-Sham
exchange-correlation energy.

To conclude, it is gratifying that the present method
oﬀers a general prescription to estimate quantal mo-
mentum space properties starting from coordinate space
n(~r) alone, with no reference to the many- electron wave

wherein directional Compton proﬁles could be derived

by the form of the external binding potential endowing
the present scheme with generality for any bound state
problem.

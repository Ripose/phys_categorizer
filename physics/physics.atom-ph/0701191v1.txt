Abstract

Atom interferometers using Bose-Einstein condensate that is conﬁned in a waveguide and manip-

ulated by optical pulses have been limited by their short coherence times. We present a theoretical

model that oﬀers a physically simple explanation for the loss of contrast and propose the method

for increasing the fringe contrast by recombining the atoms at a diﬀerent time. A simple, quantita-

tively accurate, analytical expression for the optimized recombination time is presented and used

to place limits on the physical parameters for which the contrast may be recovered.

INTRODUCTION

The realization of a practical chip-based atom interferometer, using a Bose-Einstein con-

densate, (BEC) would revolutionize internal navigation systems, precision measurements,

and, perhaps, quantum information technology. The production and manipulation of a con-

densate using an atom chip is appealing for many reasons. The trapping potentials, for the

same electrical current, have a much higher frequency then their larger scale counterparts

[1]. As a result, these devices require less power. An atomic cloud conﬁned in a trap with

a large frequency can be cooled to ultra-cold temperatures more rapidly [2], making the

realization of a quasi-continuous source of condensed atoms more feasible. Chips also enable

integration of several relatively simple components into devices with complex functionality

[3, 4]. Finally, the entire device, including the vacuum chamber, can be miniaturized [5],

making chip-based devices the most likely path to practical applications.

The ﬁrst experimentally realized BEC-based interferometers used a double-well potential

to manipulate the atoms [6, 7]. In this type of interferometer, atoms are initially prepared

in a single potential well that conﬁnes the atoms in all three directions. Then the well is

continuously transformed into a symmetric double well, which must be done adiabatically

slow to avoid collective excitations. After the splitting, the wells are physically separated

and, due to diﬀerences in the local environment, a quantum phase shift may develop between

the atoms in each well. Nonlinearities, caused by atom-atom interactions, usually cause

problems at the recombination stage in these types of interferometers. As a result, the

atoms are recombined by suddenly switching oﬀ the trap allowing the two condensates to

ballistically expand, overlap, and interfere. The phase shift can be measured by ﬁtting the

atomic density to a cos function.

An alternative method for realizing a BEC-based atom interferometer uses a standing

light wave created by two counter-propagating laser pulses to manipulate the condensate

[8–10]. The BEC is loaded into a waveguide providing conﬁnement along two directions

but not in the third one. The standing light wave splits the BEC into two harmonics

moving in opposite directions. A second laser pulse reﬂects the harmonics by reversing their

momentum. Finally, a third pulse recombines them, thus completing the interferometer

sequence. Since the atoms are recombined in the guide, the phase shift between the two

arms of the interferometer can be measured by counting the atoms in the zero momentum

2

state at the end of the interferometer cycle.

In the ﬁrst experimental realization of this type of interferometer [8], the coherence time

was about 10 ms. The loss of coherence was theoretically explained as being due to dis-

tortion of the phase across each atomic cloud [11], which is caused by both the atom-atom

interactions and the residual external parabolic potential in the axial direction.

A similar interferometer with a coherence time of 44 ms has been realized in Ref. [9].

The coherence time of this interferometer was increased in two ways. First, the conﬁning

waveguide was created using macroscopic conductors, instead of microscopic conductors

in a chip-based device. This larger scale device had looser conﬁnement thus reducing the

eﬀect of the atom-atom interactions. Additionally, the waveguide was farther from the

conductors minimizing small perturbations due to defects in the conductors or instabilities

in the current. Second, the interferometer sequence used two reﬂections, such that each half

of the condensate went through the same path twice in opposite directions. This method

greatly reduces the phase distortion caused by the residual axial potential.

A third interferometer was recently realized in [12]. This chip-based device has a coher-

ence time of about 15 ms and uses a sightly diﬀerent splitting technique. One of the lasers

is frequency-shifted with respect to the other laser, resulting in a traveling wave optical po-

tential. Using a π/2 pulse, the condensate is split into two harmonics one of which remains
at rest and the other propagates with the momentum 2~kl. A π pulse acts as a mirror, and

ﬁnally a second π/2 recombines the condensate. As a result of this diﬀerent splitting mecha-

nism, the splitting and recombination does not take place in the same physical location and

the device is an atom Mach-Zehnder interferometer. By varying the radial conﬁnement of

the waveguide, the researchers were able to change the eﬀective strength of the atom-atom

interactions. They used this to test the theoretical model of Ref. [11] and demonstrated its

validity.

In this paper, we discuss possible ways to increase the coherence time of an atom inter-

ferometer using Bragg diﬀraction to manipulate the atoms. Simple analytical expressions

for the dynamics of the interference sequence are derived in the framework of the hydrody-

namic approximation. Their validity is conﬁrmed by their comparison with direct numerical

solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that the coherence time can be

increased by changing the recombination time and present simple analytic expressions for

the optimized recombination time and the contrast.

3

In the rest of the section, we present a simple physical explanation for the loss of contrast

in a BEC Michelson interferometer and discuss possible ways of restoring it.

The interferometric cycle of duration T starts by illuminating the motionless BEC cloud

ψ0 with a splitting pulse from a pair of counter- propagating laser beams. This pulse acts like

a diﬀraction grating splitting the cloud into two harmonics ψ+ and ψ
. The atoms diﬀracted
into the +1 order absorb a photon from a laser beam with the momentum ~kl and re-emit
~kl acquiring the net momentum 2~kl. The cloud
it into the beam with the momentum
ψ+ starts moving with the velocity v0 = 2~kl/M, where kl is the wavenumber of the laser

−

−

beams and M is the atomic mass. Similarly, the cloud ψ

starts moving with the velocity

−

v0. The two harmonics are allowed to propagate for the time T /2 and are illuminated by

−
a reﬂection optical pulse. The atoms in the harmonics ψ+ change their velocity by

2v0

−

and those in the harmonics ψ

by 2v0. The harmonics propagate back for time T /2 and are

−

subject to the action of the recombination optical pulse. After the recombination, the atoms

in general populate all three harmonics ψ0 and ψ

. The degree of population depends on

the relative phase between the harmonics ψ

acquired during the interferometric cycle and

±

±

can be used to deduce this phase. In particular, the wave function of the zero-momentum

harmonics ψ0 after the recombination is equal to

ψ0 =

(ψ+ + ψ

),

−

1
√2

(1)

where ψ

are the wave functions of the

1 harmonics immediately before the recombination.

±

±
Because of the nonlinearity and/or the external potential, the harmonics ψ

do not travel

±

with the velocities

v0 during the cycle. First, the cloud “climbing up” the external potential

±

slows down and the one moving “downhill” speeds up. Second, because of the nonlinearity,

the speeds of the two clouds after their separation will be slightly larger than v0 if the

nonlinearity is repulsive and slightly less than v0 if it is attractive. For deﬁniteness, we

shall discuss the inﬂuence of the repulsive nonlinearity assuming that the external potential

is zero. An ideal operation of the interferometer in this case corresponds to all the atoms

populating zero-momentum harmonics ψ0 after the recombination, i.e., to N0 = Ntot.

Because of the atom-atom interaction, the clouds ψ

exert a repulsive force on each other

during the time they overlap. This force accelerates each cloud so that after the separation

pulse the ψ

harmonics propagate with velocities

(v0 + δv), where δv > 0. The reﬂection

±

pulses impart the momenta

4~kl to the clouds transforming their roles: ψ

ψ

. After

± →

∓

±

±

the reﬂection, the

1 harmonics propagate with the velocities

(v0

δv). Harmonics’

±

±

−

deceleration due to mutual repulsion during their overlap decreases the velocity of each

harmonics by an additional δv so immediately before the recombination the harmonics’

velocities are

(v0

2δv).

±

−

The nonzero value of δv results in two consequences. First, since the clouds’ speeds

after the reﬂection pulse are smaller than before the pulse, the

1 harmonics at the nom-

±

inal recombination time still do not overlap each other completely. This eﬀect is typically

not very signiﬁcant. Much more important is the fact that the returning harmonics have
2~kl and therefore can not be compensated by the recom-

momenta that are not equal to

±

bination pulse. As a result, the wave function of the zero-momentum harmonics ψ0 after

the recombination can be written as

n(x) cos(∆kx),

ψ0

∝

p

(2)

where ∆k = 2Mδv/~ and n(x) are the density proﬁles of the harmonics; their possible

incomplete overlap has been neglected. The population of the zero-momentum harmonics

is obtained by the spatial integration of

1, where R is the characteristic

ψ0

2. For ∆kR

|

|

≪

size of the clouds, all the atoms after the recombination are indeed in the zeroth harmonics,

i.e. N0 = Ntot. In the opposite case ∆kR

1, the cos function oscillates several times

≫
across the cloud and N0/Ntot = 1/2 resulting in the loss of contrast. It is worth noting that

the accumulation of corrections to the wave vectors of the clouds is due to the fact that

the reﬂecting pulses do not reverse the clouds’ velocities but rather add a constant velocity

2v0 to them. This explains the fact that the coherence may be lost due to the presence of

±
an external potential even when the nonlinearity is negligible.

The above-discussed loss of coherence due to incomplete cancelation of the wave vectors

of the harmonics by the recombination pulse can be also visualized in the following way: the

wave functions of the ψ

harmonics can be represented as ψ

±

is the parabolic phase (the nominal phase

n
), where φ
±
±
(Mv0/~)x is taken care of by the optical pulses

(x) exp(iφ

=

±

±

p

and is not included). In the ideal situation, the parabolic phase for each cloud is centered

at the middle of the cloud. Nonzero values of δv (or, equivalently, nonzero values of the

corrections to the wave vectors of the clouds) mean that the phase of each cloud leads or

lags behind its density envelope. This situation is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 showing

the harmonic ψ+ before the recombination with its phase leading the density envelope. We

±

5

shall show that the optimum recombination corresponds to the situation when the phase

proﬁles, not the density envelopes of the clouds are on top of each other immediately before

the recombination.

Operation with high values of the contrast can be achieved in several ways. First, the

relative magnitudes of the nonlinearity and the external potential are adjusted in such

a way that their eﬀects cancel each other for a given cycle time T (this is not always

possible). Second, the recombination and/or reﬂection are conducted with optical pulses

having diﬀerent wavelength as compared to the splitting pulse to compensate for the change

in the wave vectors of the moving clouds. Finally, the recombination is carried out not at

the nominal recombination time T but at a time such that ∆kR = 0. The paper is devoted

to the analysis of the last possibility.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sec. II provides general formulation of

the problem, Sec. III introduces analytical model of the interferometric cycle and Sec. IV

is devoted to the analysis of the contrast and contains the analytical expressions for the

optimized recombination time. These expressions are discussed in diﬀerent limiting cases in

Sec. V.

is the s-wave scattering length and M is the atomic mass. The potential Vtot = V3D(r, t) +

Vopt(t) cos(2klx) is the sum of a conﬁning potential V3D and an optical potential that is

created by two counter-propagating laser beams of wavelength λ = 2π/kl, which are detuned

from the atomic resonance to avoid spontaneous emission. The optical potential is used to

split, recombine and reverse direction of propagation of the BEC clouds.

The optical potential Ω(τ ) cos x acts as a diﬀraction grating for the condensate wave

tiples of the grating wavevector. If the width of the Fourier spectrum of the condensate is

much smaller than the length of the grating wavevector (one in our dimensional units), the

wave function ψ(x, t) in Fourier space consists of a series of narrow peaks. It is therefore

convenient to represent ψ(x, t) as

independently of the value of the relative phase shift.

Equations (22) and (21) show that both the nonlinearity of the condensate p and the

quadratic contribution to the external potential β can result in nonzero values of ∆k given

by Eq. (40) and thus be responsible for the loss of interferometric contrast as illustrated

by Fig. 2. This ﬁgure shows the contrast V deﬁned by the relation N0/Ntot = (1 + V )/2,

where N0/Ntot is the relative population of the zero-momentum harmonics at the end of the

interferometric cycle, as a function of the ratio of the cycle time to the initial size of the

harmonic T /R0. The solid line corresponds to the numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii

equation (6). The dashed line is given by Eq. (43), where ∆kR is calculated with the help

of analytical expressions (40), (21), (22) and (30).

Since the linear slope of the potential is zero (α = 0), θ0 = 0. Equation (43) then

predicts that for ∆kR = 0, V = 1. As is seen in Fig. 2, the contrast indeed equals one for

short cycles (small T ). Larger values of T correspond to larger interaction times between

the two clouds and an increase in ∆kR due to this interaction. As the interaction time

increases, the contract V given by Eq. (43) goes down from one to small negative value

resulting in the values of N0/Ntot slightly below 1/2. At times larger than about T /R0 = 1.5

15

the two harmonics completely pass each other and stop overlapping during a part of the

cycle. The interaction time between the harmonics (the time when they overlap) is now

smaller than the cycle time and does not depend on it. The contrast and the population of

the zero-momentum harmonic reach their limiting values. Figure 3 shows the dependence

of the population of the zeroth-order harmonic after the recombination N0/Ntot on the
αT 2/2. The solid line corresponds to the numerical

relative accumulated phase shift θ0 =

solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (6). The dashed line is Eq. (42) with ∆kR given

by Eqs. (21), (22) and (30). As is seen in Fig. 2, the cycle time T /R0 = 4 corresponds to

small negative values of the contrast (V

0.2 as given by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation

and V

0.1 as given by the analytic model). Low values of the contrast result in the

≈ −

washout of the interference fringes shown in Fig. 3. It also should be noted that since the

contrast V is negative, the symmetric recombination with θ0 = 0 corresponds not to the

−

≈ −

maximum, but the minimum population N0 of the zero-momentum harmonic.

Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate that recombination with nonzero value of the linear wavevec-

tor ∆k (see Eq. (40)) washes out the interference fringes. Since ∆k is a function of time,

this eﬀect can be compensated for by conducting the recombination not at the nominal time

T but at a slightly diﬀerent time T + ∆T when ∆kR = 0 (in general, ∆T may be both
positive and negative). Figure 4 shows the contrast V = 2N0/Ntot −
relative population of the zero-momentum harmonic, as a function of the time ∆T . Negative

1, where N0/Ntot is

(positive) values of ∆T correspond to the recombination taking place slightly before (after)

the nominal recombination time T . The parameters for Fig. 4 are T = 2000, R0 = 500

and p = 5 with all other parameters being zero. The solid line is the solution of the Gross-

Pitaevskii equation and the dashed line is obtained with the help of Eqs. (42), (21), (22)

and (32). Recombination at the nominal time ∆T = 0 corresponds to a small value of the

contrast and a washout of the fringes as is shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 4 indicates that if

the recombination takes place at ∆T /R0

0.2, the contrast of the fringes becomes much

larger. This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 5, which shows N0/Ntot versus the relative accumulated

phase shift θ0 =

(44)

The ratio ∆T /R gives the relative displacement of the two clouds at the recombination time

T + ∆T since the clouds pass across each other in time R (each cloud has the size 2R and

the relative speed is 2).

The population of the zero-momentum harmonics depends not only on the magnitude of

∆kR, but on the degree of overlap of the two density envelopes at the recombination time

(see (37)). Estimate (44) takes into account only changes in ∆kR but not in the overlap

in evaluating ∆T . The last can be taken into account in the framework of Eq. (37) at

the expense of making formulas more cumbersome and turn out to be not very signiﬁcant.

As we shall see, Eq. (44) is in a very good qualitative and quantitative agrement with

the results of numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (6). Finally it should be

mentioned that nonzero values of ∆T /R mean incomplete overlap and thus the contrast less

than one even at the optimized time. The larger is

∆T

/R, the smaller the contrast. The

estimate (44) implicitly implies that

Equations (46) and (47) are the main analytical results of the paper. In Section V, they will

V. DISCUSSION

A.

Inﬂuence of the nonlinearity p for g0 = β = 0

For β = g0 = 0, Eq. (46) becomes

∆T
R

=

2D1(T /R)
D2(T /R) + 3T /4R

−

Equation (48) shows that the correction to the recombination time depends only on the

single parameter T /R and does not depend on the nonlinearity of the condensate p (the

applicability of the parabolic approximation requires pR

1). This is due to the fact that

both the ∆κ and the gR terms are proportional to the nonlinearity parameter p. At small

values of T /R, D1(T /R)

so

i.e., ∆T /R grows linearly with T /R. The correction to the recombination time ∆T /R

reaches maximum for T /R

2 when the duration of the cycle is such that the two clouds at

their maximum separation stop overlapping. At longer cycle times T /R > 2, both D1 and

D2 become constants and ∆T /R starts decreasing inversely proportional to T :

This behavior has simple physical explanation. The diﬀerence between the corrections to

the propagation velocities of the clouds ∆κ is due to the nonlinear interaction between the

clouds and is accumulated only when the clouds overlap (see the deﬁnition of D1 Eq. (23)).

For short cycle times T /R < 2, when the clouds overlap during all the cycle, the nonlinear
T 2. The parabolic phase described by the

eﬀects are accumulated during all times and ∆κ

∝

coeﬃcient g(T ) grows linearly with time T , so the correction to the recombination time T

is a growing function of the cycle time T . For T > R, when the clouds fully separate during

the cycle, ∆κ is at its maximum possible value and stops growing further. The quadratic

phase proﬁle of each cloud, on the other hand, keeps growing as a function of time, i.e., g

becomes larger, thus resulting in the decrease of ∆T .

The dependence of the shift in the recombination time ∆T /R0 on the cycle time T /R0

is shown in Fig. 6 for R0 = 500 and p = 5. The maximum cycle times shown in Fig. 6

correspond to the maximum separation of the clouds equal to about ten their diameters. The

dots are the results obtained by direct numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation

(6) and the solid line is given by Eq. (48). The optimized contrast of the interference fringes

V at the recombination time T + ∆T for the parameters of Fig. 7 is shown in Fig. 7. The

dots correspond to the numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the solid line

is given by Eq. (47). For comparison, the dashed line shows the contrast at the nominal

recombination time T given by Eqs. (43) and (40). The lowest values of the optimized

contrast V

0.5 correspond to intermediate cycle times T /R0

2 when the maximum

≈

≈

separation between the two clouds is equal to their size. Both increasing and decreasing the

cycle time T improves the contrast.

Figs. 6 and (7) show that the operation of the atom Michelson interferometer with the

optimization of the recombination time is possible both in the limit T /2R0

1 when the

clouds overlap during all the cycle and in the opposite limit T /2R0

1 when the clouds

≤

≫

are separated most of the time.

B. Nonzero initial parabolic phase g0

= 0

Performing an interferometric cycle with nonzero initial values of the parabolic phase g0

considerably improves the coherence as compared to the case g0 = 0 provided the sign of g0

is the same as that of the nonlinearity p. The nonzero initial parabolic phase can be acquired

19

6
by relaxing the conﬁnement frequency ω of the initial trap and letting the condensate evolve

for some time before the start of the interferometric cycle. Dynamics of the BEC in time-

dependent parabolic traps in Thomas-Fermi limit has been extensively analyzed (see, e.g.

[14–16]). In the case of 1D expansion corresponding to our situation, the evolution of g(τ )

and r = R(τ )/R(0) is described by the set of equations

ω2(τ )r +

ln r,

where ω(τ ) is the trap frequency. The exact value of g depends on the detailed time depen-

dence of ω(τ ). Changing ω(τ ) adiabatically slowly leaves the phase of the condensate ﬂat,

i.e. g = 0. Since we are interested in the maximum possible value of g, we shall consider

the limit when the trap frequency is relaxed very fast so that ω(τ ) = 0 for τ > 0. In this

limit, g is given by the relation (the condensate’s initial phase in the trap is zero):

(cid:19)

where Rtr is the initial radius of the condensate in the trap. An extra factor of two in

Eq. (52) as compared to Eq. (32) is due to the fact that the initial condensate is normalized

to one whereas the two propagating clouds are normalized to 1/2.

For the given value of Rtp, g is maximum for r = 3/2. The ﬁnal size of the condensate

after the expansion is the initial size R0 of the propagating clouds in the interferometric

cycle, i.e., R0/Rtr = 3/2. The maximum possible value of g0 is thus given by the relation

g0,max =

1/2

.

In the following we will use the value g0 = sg0,max where the coeﬃcient 0

for relaxing the trap with ﬁnite speed.

The correction to the recombination time ∆T /R given by the equation (46) with β = 0

takes the form

∆T
R

=

2D1(T /R)
(3/4)(T /R) + D2(T /R) + s(3R/2p)1/2

−

If the parameter (R/p) is large, which is typically the case, the corrections to the recombi-

nation time are small and the contrast is high. This is illustrated by Fig. 8 which shows the

shift in the recombination time ∆T /R as a function of the cycle time T /R using Eq. (54).

The solid line corresponds to s = 0 when the condensate does not have initial parabolic

phase. The dashed curve gives ∆T /R for s = 0.2, when the condensate has been allowed to

acquire initial parabolic phase. The dots are the results of a numerical solution of the GPE

with s = 0.2. Figure 8 demonstrates that the shift in the recombination time is considerably

smaller when the condensate is allowed to expand before the beginning of the cycle. Since

the two harmonics have larger overlap at the optimal recombination time, the contrast in

the interference fringes is larger when g0

= 0.

C. Nonzero parabolic external potential β

Nonzero values of the parabolic external potential β

technical imperfections of an experimental apparatus. Equation (46) with β

where ζ = T /R. The inﬂuence of the parabolic potential on the operation of the atom
Michelson interferometer is characterized by the parameter b = βR3/p. Note that since the

term with β in the numerator of Eq. (55) is proportional to the square of the cycle time and

the denominator grows linearly with time, even small values of b for long enough cycles will

always result in a complete loss of coherence.

In the limit of short cycle times ζ

1, Eq. (54) takes the form

Equation (56) is similar to Eq. (49) but the sign of ∆T can be both negative and positive

depending on the value of b. The second diﬀerence is in that the coeﬃcient multiplying ζ

may become so large for positive values of b

5/2, that coherence will be lost even for short

≈
cycle times. Negative values of β are preferable because they ensure the operation of the

interferometer at least for short times T /R

1. If the value of β is controlled at the level

1, the operation of the interferometer is possible for ∆T /R < 1 and any sign of β.

D. Recombination at a diﬀerent wavelength

The contrast of the interference fringes can be improved by conducting the recombina-

tion with optical pulses having diﬀerent wavelength as compared to the splitting pulse to

compensate for the change in the wave vectors of the moving clouds. The relative change in

the wavelength of the recombining pulse ∆λ/λ as compared to the separation pulse is given

by the expression (cf. Eq. (21))

The recombination then should be performed with beams of larger wavelength. Similarly,

for β < 0 (a potential hump) ∆λ > 0 and for β > 0 (a potential trough) ∆λ < 0. The

optimized contrast is determined by the relation

APPENDIX A: DYNAMICS OF THE BEC DUE TO THE OPTICAL PULSES

The optical potential is used to split the initial zero-momentum BEC cloud at the begin-

ning of the interferometric cycle into the two harmonics with the momenta

1, reverse their

±

direction of propagation in the middle of the cycle and recombine them at the end. The

optical pulses are short and suﬃciently intense so that the dynamics of the condensate is

dominated by the optical potential when the laser beams are on and the diﬀraction, relative

displacements of the clouds and the nonlinearity can be neglected. A good quantitative

description of the BEC dynamics can be obtained keeping only the lowest three harmonics

with n = 0,

1 in Eq. (7). The set of Eq. (8) with these approximations reduces to

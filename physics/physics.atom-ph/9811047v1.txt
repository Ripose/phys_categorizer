Abstract. A new and computationally viable full quantum version of line shape
theory is obtained in terms of a mixed Weyl symbol calculus. The basic ingredient in
the collision–broadened line shape theory is the time dependent dipole autocorrelation
function of the radiator-perturber system. The observed spectral intensity is the
Fourier transform of this correlation function. A modiﬁed form of the Wigner–
Weyl
isomorphism between quantum operators and phase space functions (Weyl
symbols) is introduced in order to describe the quantum structure of this system.
This modiﬁcation uses a partial Wigner transform in which the radiator-perturber
relative motion degrees of freedom are transformed into a phase space dependence,
while operators associated with the internal molecular degrees of freedom are kept
in their original Hilbert space form. The result of this partial Wigner transform
is called a mixed Weyl symbol. The star product, Moyal bracket and asymptotic
expansions native to the mixed Weyl symbol calculus are determined. The correlation
function is represented as the phase space integral of the product of two mixed symbols:
one corresponding to the initial conﬁguration of the system, the other being its time
evolving dynamical value. There are, in this approach, two semiclassical expansions —
one associated with the perturber scattering process, the other with the mixed symbol
star product. These approximations are used in combination to obtain representations
of the autocorrelation that are suﬃciently simple to allow numerical calculation. The
leading O(¯h0
) approximation recovers the standard classical path approximation for
line shapes. The higher order O(¯h1
) corrections arise from the noncommutative nature
of the star product.

Introduction

Osborn, Kondrat’eva, Tabisz and McQuarrie

Collision–broadened spectral line shapes carry important information on the time-
dependent dynamical and collisional processes occurring in a radiating medium. For
a system consisting of radiators (light emitting or absorbing species) and perturbers
(atoms, molecules, ions or electrons), the basic ingredient in spectral line shape theory
is the Fourier transform of the time autocorrelation function of the radiator dipole. The
physical processes here involve the dynamical evolution of the radiator as it undergoes
multiple collisions with a large number of perturbers. The interaction between the time
dependent radiator dipole moment and the electromagnetic ﬁeld induces absorption
and emission. In this paper we develop a phase space based representation of quantum
mechanics that is suitable for determining this dynamics. Within this formalism there
are two diﬀerent semiclassical approximations. These are employed in tandem to obtain
representations of the autocorrelation function that are suﬃciently simple to allow
numerical calculation.

The method developed here is suggested by the Moyal description[1] of quantum
mechanics, which is based on the Wigner–Weyl isomorphism[2] between Hilbert space
operators and functions (Weyl symbols) on classical phase space. In this isomorphism[3]
the canonical (ˆqi, ˆpi) operators are transformed into linear phase space functions (qi, pi).
The line shape problem presents one with two distinguished degrees of freedom: the
internal molecular coordinates and the relative radiator–perturber separation variables.
In many circumstances (large mass, large impact parameter, high relative velocity, weak
pairwise interaction) one expects the relative motion to be nearly classical. On the
other hand, evolutions of the subsystems associated with the internal coordinates are,
generally, far from classical. This circumstance is exploited by the introduction of a
partial Wigner transform that converts the relative motion degrees of freedom into
phase space variables, but keeps operators associated with the internal coordinates in
their original Hilbert space form. The result of this transformation we call a mixed Weyl
symbol.

Our approach to a quantum line shape theory is strongly inﬂuenced by the well
established ‘classical path approximation’, which is used in many areas of atomic and
molecular physics. It assumes that the perturbers move as classical particles, that is,
along deﬁnite paths determined by the radiator–perturber interaction. The traditional
justiﬁcation for this approximation arises from the notion that one may consider the
motion of perturbers in terms of packets of translational wave functions, following
the laws of classical mechanics. Anderson[4] in setting up his pioneering line shape
theory argued, that since the typical distances of closest approach are about 5˚A, an
uncertainty in position of 1˚A leads to no great ambiguity in the magnitude or the type
of intermolecular forces involved in the collision. He invoked the uncertainty principle to

conclude that the corresponding uncertainty in velocity is only a few percent for most
molecular pairs. The approximation evidently breaks down [5] when the de Broglie
wavelength of the perturber is comparable to or larger than a characteristic distance
over which the intermolecular potential varies appreciably. An alternative way [6] of
expressing this condition is that for the proﬁle to be adequately treated with a classical
path, the collisions of signiﬁcance must have large angular momentum. Such a condition
is reminiscent of that required to calculate scattering cross sections classically[7]. Early
derivations of the approximation employed heuristic arguments which relied on physical
insight. The subsequent work of Baranger[5] and Smith et al [8] uniﬁed the derivation
of the classical path approximation, and in particular employed statistical mechanics to
justify the representation of the correlation function as an integral over the phase space
variables of the perturber. The phase space average procedure [9] remains a cornerstone
of the theory to the present.

The system we shall consider is a dilute gas in which each of the radiator and
perturber subsystems is in equilibrium and in which the binary collision approximation
is valid. The binary collision approximation, which implies that strong collisions between
radiator and perturber are well-separated in time, is a central assumption [10] in most
line broadening theories. The radiator density is suﬃciently low that the radiator–
radiator interaction may be ignored. The linewidth is dominated by collision broadening
eﬀects; Doppler and lifetime broadening are omitted from the analysis. The heavy
radiator approximation is thereby imposed. The radiator and perturber subsystems are
statistically independent; that is, the state of the perturber does not depend explicitly
on the state of the radiator and vice versa. This assumption is frequently termed the
‘lack of back reaction’ in the density matrix. Consequently the density matrix may be
factored as ˆρ = ˆρ(R) ˆρ(P ), where ˆρ(R) and ˆρ(P ) depend only on the radiator and perturber
variables, respectively [11]. Finally, since interest lies primarily in the eﬀect of the ﬁeld–
radiator interaction on the radiator, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is treated classically. For
an overview of collision–broadening, the reader is referred to the review [6] of Allard
and Kielkopf.

A traditional starting point for the development of line shape theory is the expression
for the power gained or lost from the radiation ﬁeld to the molecular many body system
in making electric dipole transitions from all initial states i to all possible ﬁnal states
f . The power produced by a single radiator interacting with the perturbers, is given
if ¯hωif ρiPif where Pif is the Fermi Golden Rule probability per unit time for a
by
transition between states i and f having an energy diﬀerence Ei − Ef = ¯hωif . The
weight factor ρi is the initial state density. The frequency content of this expression is
known as the line shape or spectral proﬁle, I(ω). If CN (t) is the N-perturber dipole-

L2(Rd1 × Rd2). For reasons of clarity of presentation and notational convenience, we
assume that the perturber may be treated as a point particle. This means that q is
a three dimensional vector (d2 = 3). The mixed Weyl symbol calculus and line shape
theory developed here are valid for all values of d1 and d2. If desired, the one perturber
Hamiltonian (1.2a) may be extended to a many perturber system.

The statistical structure of the radiator–perturber system is normally assumed to be a

that the eﬀects of statistics (via

Like Γ (h2; t), the quantities γ(2n)(h2; t) are maps on symbols. In reference [3] explicit
formulas for γ(2n)(h2; t) were derived as a result of a connected graph representation for
Γ (h2; t). The leading term γ(0)(h2; t) (as has long been known [14, 15, 16]) is determined
by the h2 generated classical ﬂow. The higher order operator coeﬃcients, beginning
with γ(2)(h2; t), have the form of partial diﬀerential operators [cf. (3.7c)] acting on
symbols. Combining expansion (1.6b) and (1.6a) yields a semiclassical expansion for
the expectation value h
A(t)iψ. With suitable restrictions on Aw, rigorous error bound
estimates are available for the asymptotic expansion (1.6b). The early work of Antonets
[14] veriﬁed, for ﬁnite time displacements t ∈ [0, T ], that Γ (h2, t)Aw → γ(0)(h2; t)Aw in
an appropriate norm as ¯h → 0. More recently new proofs [17] have been constructed
that obtain error estimates that hold for arbitrary time displacements.

b

The principal goal of this paper is to derive a modiﬁed version of Moyal quantum
mechanics that treats the perturber degrees of freedom with a phase space formalism
like (1.5)–(1.6) while maintaining a consistent H1–operator valued description of the
radiator degrees of freedom. Within this hybrid operator–symbol formalism, the Moyal
bracket induces a natural semiclassical expansion. The leading approximation is shown
to recover the classical path approximation. Higher order corrections are well deﬁned
and suﬃciently simple to allow numerical calculation.

2. Mixed Weyl Symbol Calculus

The mixed Weyl symbol is a parametric family of operators that arises when a phase
space function is quantized in a subset of its canonical variables. The conventional
symbol is a complex valued function in phase space, whereas the mixed Weyl symbol
is operator valued.
In this section, we modify the Wigner transform[13] and Weyl
quantization[18] procedures so that they deﬁne a mixed Weyl symbol formalism. Within
this formalism we construct representations of the noncommutative star product, the
Moyal bracket[1] and the trace formulas that determine expectation values. The
asymptotic expansions, which form the basis of a semiclassical analysis, are also
obtained.

Each of the Hi subspace components of H = H1 ⊗ H2 has its own set of canonical
operators and coordinates. We distinguish these variables by employing upper case

lead one to recover the Wigner transform (2.2a).

2.3. Star Product Asymptotics

In many circumstances the ∗ product is close to commutative multiplication, and the
diﬀerence of these two products is described by an asymptotic expansion involving
derivatives of symbols. In this subsection we construct derivative expansions for mixed
Weyl symbols and summarize their asymptotic structure.

Asymptotic expansions of the ∗ product are a consequence of the large λ limit of the
integral (2.7b). In these expansions it is desirable to have an eﬀective small ¯h scaling,
but our line shape application requires that Planck’s constant be ﬁxed at its physical
value, ¯h = 1.055 × 10−34J·s.
In order to accommodate these opposing demands, we
set λ = (ǫ¯h)−1 in (2.7b), and eﬀect the small ¯h scaling by letting the dimensionless
parameter ǫ → 0.

First recall Groenewold’s [23, 24] expansion for C–valued symbols. Suppose the

Mixed Weyl Symbol Calculus and Spectral Line Shape Theory

operators ˆf , ˆg on H2 have symbols f = σ( ˆf ), g = σ(ˆg). For small ǫ, one has

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

The ﬁrst term on the right of (2.8b) is ordinary multiplication, while the term linear in
ǫ is the Poisson bracket, {f, g} = ∇f ·J (2)∇g. The tensor indices µ1 · · · µn on f and g
denote the partial derivative ∂n/∂zµ1 · · · ∂zµn . The remainder RN (z) is O(ǫN ).

We require expansions analogous to (2.8) in which f and g are replaced by mixed
Weyl symbols. A useful derivative notation adapted to the Groenewold type expansion
is the following. Denote by B the extended Poisson bracket operator for T ∗
2 . The B
operator acts on a tuple of mixed Weyl symbols ≺
Yw2 ≻ to produce a new mixed
Weyl symbol. The ﬁrst and higher iterates of B are

As λ → ∞ the exponential in (2.7b) oscillates rapidly. This circumstance justiﬁes an

The parameter ǫ ∈ [0, 1] measures the deformation of the ∗ product from the
conventional ǫ = 0 product.
It provides a one dimensional variable that allows one
to characterize the derivative expansions, (2.8) and (2.10), as ǫ → 0 asymptotic
approximations of the ∗ operation. However, even if ǫ = 1 and there is no exposed
small parameter, the Groenewold formulas (2.8) and (2.10) may still be valid asymptotic
expansions. (See Appendix A).

The mathematical analysis of this section is heuristic and formal in style. Our
intention has been to start from well known facts about the Wigner transforms and to
keep the derivations at the simplest level consistent with obtaining all the structural
formulas needed for the line shape problem. Nevertheless, we note that in the
approximate theory given in Section 4, the space H1 is replaced by an N–dimensional
subspace H(N )
and so the mixed symbols become N × N matrix functions. For matrix
valued symbols the rigorous methods and convergence estimates of pseudodiﬀerential
operator analysis (cf. Appendix A) will be applicable with straightforward modiﬁcations.
A precursor of the mixed Weyl symbol formalism, employing matrix valued symbols,
was used in [27] to obtain equations of motion for quantum mean values in a Schr¨odinger
evolution problem with a Hamiltonian containing spin structure. There one also ﬁnds
an analog of the classical path approach.

A common building block in the expressions for γ(n)(H2; τ ) is the Jacobi ﬁeld ∇g(τ |z)
and its higher order derivatives ∇∇g(τ |z), etc. Jacobi ﬁelds describe the stability of a
trajectory g(τ |z) with respect to small changes of its initial data. Diﬀerentiating (3.2d)

We refer to expansion (3.7) as the standard semiclassical expansion of Γ (H2; τ ). The

feature here is that the target object
In the case where the

Poisson bracket equation of motion. The inhomogenous component is formed from the

terms have representations [3, Eq.(4.16)] that are substantially more complicated than
the γ(2)(H2; τ ) formula (3.7c).

Recently an extensive numerical study [28] of the eﬀectiveness of the two term
asymptotic expansion (1.6b) was carried out. For systems with identical atom–atom
pairs, such as helium, neon and argon, the time evolution of quantum expectation
values was computed. The pair interaction in these systems was a phenomenologically
determined Lennard–Jones potential. There was no diﬃculty in computing the functions
(gµ(τ |z), z(2)
µ (τ |z), wµν(τ |z) and wµνλ(τ |z)) which enabled the construction of γ(0)(h2; τ )
and γ(2)(h2; τ ). The scattering problem was investigated for a variety of Gaussian

contributions of γ(2)(h2; τ ) to the expectation value.

One factor favoring the good convergence of expansion (1.6b), in the problems of
interest here, is that the classical system is completely integrable. This means that the
classical ﬂow is not chaotic. In particular, this implies that for almost all z ∈ T ∗
2 the
Jacobi ﬁeld ∇g(τ |z) can not have exponential growth in τ . Nevertheless, there exists a
set of unstable classical trajectories in this problem. All these motions are associated
with an unstable equilibrium point. These points occur when the radial potential energy
ve(r) ≡ v(r) + L2/(2mr2) (for a given angular momentum L) has v′
e(r) = 0, with
v′′
e (r) < 0. Associated with this ﬁxed point one obtains unstable orbits with positive
Lyapunov exponent. The numerical studies we completed establish that the n = 2 term
expansion (1.6b) is inaccurate for large time displacements in the small region of phase
space surrounding the unstable ﬁxed points . In this neighborhood of phase space, one
must devise a diﬀerent approximation for Γ (h2; τ ). Several alternatives for overcoming
this diﬃculty are oﬀered in Section 5.

The second version of (4.4) uses the complete basis {|Φki}∞
k=1 to evaluate the H1 trace.
Since the integrand is just the product of two symbols, cf. (2.14), the ∗ operation may
be removed. Throughout this section the dimension d2 = 3.

4.2. Approximate Mixed Symbol Dynamics

For typical molecular systems, equations (4.3c) are too diﬃcult to solve exactly. Further
progress depends on developing approximate solutions that take advantage of the type
of physics present in the line shape problem and the opportunities for simpliﬁcation
inherent in the mixed symbol formalism. The statement of exact dynamics provides
a point of departure for the construction of various approximating methods. Possible
options are the conversion of (4.3c) into an integral equation, the use of perturbation
theory, and the development of an eikonal representation. The approach we take here is
to focus on the semiclassical structure. The subsequent reductions of (4.3) rest on three
approximations:

1)

It is assumed that only a small number of

k=1 signiﬁcantly

the right-hand side. In this sense (4.6) is very diﬀerent in its ¯h analytic structure than
the Moyal equation of motion (1.5b), where such cancellation does occur. This means
that methods for approximately solving (4.6) are not close parallels of the standard
semiclassical expansions, (1.6b) or (3.7a).

At this level of truncation one has recovered the classical path approximations to the
line shape theory. The associated correlation function results from replacing X j(t|z) in
(4.4) with χ0,j(t|z) and restricting the k sum to N terms. To further clarify this point
consider again the rigid rotor example, cf. (1.2b). Write the classical ﬂow generated
by h2 in terms of its coordinate and momentum parts: g(t|z) = (q(t|z), p(t|z)). The
molecular interaction M becomes

5. Conclusions

b

The spectral proﬁle of the intensity of an emission or absorption line is the Fourier
transform of the dipole autocorrelation function CN (t). In this paper we have introduced
a mixed Weyl symbol formalism to represent the dynamics needed to construct the
single perturber C(t). Within this approach, the radiator–perturber relative separation
variables are characterized by the phase space T ∗
2 , which serves as the support for the
operator valued mixed symbols. Expectation values and in particular C(t) are realized,
cf. (4.4), by a phase space average over traces of the product of symbols. The result is a
fully quantum theory of spectral line shapes. In the mixed symbol representation there
is never any need to refer to perturber wave packets.

Furthermore, the symbol equation of motion (4.6) for the time evolving dipole
moment, χj
kr(t|z), admits a natural semiclassical expansion which is based on the
derivative expansion of the Moyal bracket. The mixed symbol formalism embeds within
itself the classical path approximation, which appears as the leading order of the
semiclassical truncation. The subsequent corrections arise from the noncommutative
nature of the ∗ product for the mixed symbol.

The simpliﬁcations that result from the ﬁnite state coupling approximation 1) and
the semiclassical expansions 2) and 3), give equations of motion that are suitable for
numerical solution. To order O(ǫ1) the equations (4.7) and (4.9) are no more elaborate
than those previously used to numerically compute the atom–atom collision problem
within the Moyal formalism, cf. [28]. The ﬁrst term of (4.10) is entirely equivalent to
the dipole autocorrelation function written in the classical path approximation and thus
contains the same information as, for example, equation (4.2) in Griem’s treatise [29].
It must be emphasized, however, that (4.10) gives the ﬁrst two terms of a completely
quantum mechanical expression for C(t). The established success of the classical path
approximation in accounting for observed line shapes means that the O(ǫ0) version of
the theory has much of the correct physics built into it.

For heavy perturbers the classical path approximation works well. The diatomic
molecular radiator–atomic perturber case has received much attention; for example,
HCl–Ar collisions were studied by Nielsen and Gordon [30]. More recently, Looney and
Herman [31] made a comparison of comprehensive calculations of the N2–broadened

24

Osborn, Kondrat’eva, Tabisz and McQuarrie

rotational lines in the fundamental band of HCl with state-of-the-art experimental data
[32] and found excellent agreement. Evidence that the O(ǫ1) correction may be suﬃcient
in many cases for an accurate quantum mechanical treatment comes from the work of
Smith, Giraud and Cooper [33] on CO–He. Their classical path calculations for this
light perturber system agreed with close–coupling calculations to within 10%.

Transforming the general autocorrelation function in (4.10) through (1.1) to give
the proﬁle I(ω) can be diﬃcult. The line shape problem has two frequently employed
limits, the impact approximation which applies to line centers and the quasi–static
approximation which describes the far spectral wings [6]. Various uniﬁed theories have
been devised to connect these two regimes. Similar strategies will have to be applied to
(4.10) and (1.1) in order to compute actual proﬁles accurately.

It is customary,

The mixed symbol method of computing C(t) has an important ﬂexibility. The
total isotropic intermolecular interaction energy is v2 + V (0)

12 = 0. This means that the trajectories generated
by h2 = h2,0 + v2 are consistent with the full central potential. However, one can

trajectories are constant velocity straight lines. Here all the isotropic potential resides
in V (0)
H(t)w2(z) =
H12)w2(g(−t|z)). In this circumstance all the semiclassical behavior comes from
H1 + (
approximation 3). This approach would improve upon the usual straight line trajectory
c
technique often used to treat the broadening of atomic lines by ionic perturbers [29].
Another appealing option is to place all the attractive part of the intermolecular
interaction in V (0)
12 . Now v2 will be purely repulsive and for this reason the h2 ﬂow
will not have any unstable ﬁxed points. In this way the unstable ﬁxed point long time
breakdown[28, 34, 17] of the standard semiclassical approximation is avoided.

12 . For h2,0 evolution, the O(ǫ0) formula (4.5) in 2) is exact, namely

We have introduced the mixed Weyl symbol formalism in order to obtain a new
and computationally viable full quantum version of line shape theory. However the
mixed symbol representation is also applicable to any composite system having distinct
quantum and semiclassical degrees of freedom. The scattering of spin dependent
particles and the Coulomb excitation of an atom or a nucleus are additional examples
of such systems.

In the rigorous approach there are two important questions: a) The convergence of the
integral (A.1) and the status of the Groenewold series (2.8) as an asymptotic expansion
of f ∗ g; b) The properties of the operator corresponding to a given symbol, in particular
the symbol which is the result of the ∗ product and its approximations.

The answer to these questions is eﬀected by restricting the symbols to special classes
of functions. A standard and important example is the class Sm. Take (x, ξ) to be
dimensionless versions of (q, p), and denote by Sm a set of C ∞(Rd2 × Rd2) functions
with estimate

|∇j

x∇k

ξ f (x, ξ)| ≤ Cjkhξim−|j| ,

hξi =

1 + |ξ|2

(A.2)

q

valid for all multi-indices j = (j1, . . . , jd2), k = (k1, . . . , kd2) and some constant Cjk,
uniformly for x ∈ Rd2.

Then the following statements [2, Theorem (2.49)] hold: 1) The map (f, g) → f ∗ g
is continuous from Sm1 × Sm2 → Sm1+m2. 2) For f ∈ Sm1 and g ∈ Sm2, the remainder
RN in the Groenewold series belongs to the class Sm1+m2−N and so the expansion (2.8a)
becomes asymptotic. In other words, RN = O(hξim1+m2−N ) and the error term vanishes
as either N → ∞ while hξi > 1, or as hξi → ∞ while N > m1 + m2. In this sense
the derivative series (2.8a) is a valid asymptotic expansion even when the small scale
parameter ǫ is ﬁxed at unity.

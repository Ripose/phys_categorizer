4 The role of inner-shell excitations in electron

recombination with complex multicharged ions

Abstract. We performed an overview of the inner shell excitation phenomena in
the study of electron recombination with multiply charged complex ions such as Auq+
(q=49-52) and Pb53+. It is found the the inner shell excitations play a signiﬁcant role in
the low energy electron recombination. Taking into account these inner shell excitations
we have calculated the energy avaraged capture cross sections. The dielectronic rate
coeﬃcients are found to be in good agreement with the experiment. We show that
the contribution from the inner-shell enhances the recombinmation rate by an order
of magitude. We also made an attempt to identify the resonaces observed by the
experiment in Au50+ and Pb53+. A prediction is made for the rate enhancement in
Au52+ in which we found the conﬁguration mixing between the doubly and the complex
multiply excited states. Analyzing the statistics of eigenstate components we estimated
the spreading width is about 0.85 a.u. which deﬁnes the energy range within which
strong mixing takes place.

1. Introduction

The electron recombination process has been the most thorougly studied problem
importance in diﬀerent areas of modern
in the present era due to its practical
physics. In particiular dielectronic recombination (DR) process is one of the important
recombination process in high temperature plasmas. Accurate DR rate coeiﬃcients are
needed for successful modeling of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. The current
interest in study of the DR is the rate enhancement in the recombination of low energy
electron with multiply charged complex ions. This enhancement phenomena was ﬁrst
[1] in U28+ ion. The interest in the rate enhancement is
observed by Muller et al.
largly due to the importance of understanding the mechanism of recombination in
particular those involving multiply charged complex ions. Appart from this the potential
application in the production of antihydrogen by recombination of an antiproton with
positrons has provided a great deal of stimulus to study the detaild mechanism of the
DR process [2]. The main feature in the rate enhancement is that at low energy, the

The role of inner-shell excitations in electron recombination with multiply charged complex ions2

measured recombination rate coeﬃcients signiﬁcantly exceed the theoretical predictions
for radiative recombination (RR). In the higher energies, measured rates is well explained
by RR theory together with contribution of DR.

The complex ions such as Au25+ [3], Au50+ [4] and Pb53+ [5, 6] show a strongly
enhanced recombination rate. In Au25+ ion the rate enhancement has been justiﬁed by
Gribakin et. al.[7] and Flambaum et. al.[8] using a statistical approach. They showed
that the electron capture is mediated by complex multiply excited states rather than
sinple dielectrronic resonances in this system. In a recent study Gribakin et. al.
[9]
have explained the detailed mechanism responsible for low energy rate enhancement
in U28+.
In this system these authors reported that the mechansim lies behind the
fact that doubly excited conﬁgurations mix with each other weakly and they do mix
with the complex multiply excited states quite comfortably. Most importantly the
excitations from inner shell hole plays a major role in the low electron energies which
was absent in the calculation of Mitnik et al [10] and is unable to produce the results in
agreement with the experiment in the low electron energies. For Pb53+ ion, Lindorth et
al [6] performed a comphrenssive study to calculate the resonances using relativistic
perturbation theory. They found on comparision with the experiment, the energy
splitting in Pb53+(4p1/2-4s1/2) with an accuracy comparable to the position of ﬁrst few
resonances and concluded that such an accuracy provides a test of QED in many body
systems. Although these authors able to identify the the resonances with a very good
precision, their theoretical values for recombination rate still needs an improvement in
order to be in good agreement with the measured data. This system is of the current
interest in the present study along with another similar system i.e., Au50+ since there is
no theory for this particular system. In order to achive a claer understanding we have
also investigated the nearest neighbouring ions such as Au49+,51+,52+.
In the present
calculation we have included the excitations from the inner shells and found that the
results are signiﬁcantly improved with this inclusion. The importance of the inner shell
ecitation in the low energy electron recombination in U28+ has already been established
[9]. Moreover, a recent study on bound doubly excited states formation when slow
highly charged ions (Taq+,q = 39-48) capture a single electron in collsion with He by
Schuch et. al.[11] reports that they observed a strog characterstics M x-Ray emission
without an M shell vecancy initially present.In the present article we present the results
of recombination rates for the above mentioned ions taking into account the inner shell
vecancy. We compare these results with the available calculations that do not take into
account the inner shell excitations. A good agreement has been achieved in comparison
with the available experimental data as well.

2. Many-electron excitations

Ref.
[7, 8] suggest that electron recombination with complex multiply charged ions is
mediated by complex multiply-excited states of the compound ions (target+e) rather
than “simple” dielectronic resonances. Electrons could be captured in these states due

threshold although a signiﬁcant number of multiply excited states are found nearby this
particular dielectronic state. It is also found that the multiply excited states are not
populated through this state and hence rate enhancement is not expected, which has
been explained by the experiment[4]. In case of Au51+, we did not ﬁnd any dielectronic
states near its ionization threshold. However, Au50+and Pb53+, shows a number of
dielectronic states near its ionization threshold and these contribute largly to the rate
enhancement. Au52+ shows there are a few dielectronic states above the ionization
threshold.
It may be mentioned that one may expect rate enhancement in this ion
because these dielectronic states shows a substantial mixing with each other. The
detailed study of the nature dielectronic states near the ionization threshold of all the
ions is disccussed later.

In a situation when there is a strong conﬁguration mixing between the dielectronic
doorway states and multiply excited states, the capture cross sections can be obtained
as a sum over the single-electron excited states α, β and hole states γ, as well as the
partial waves lj of the continuous-spectrum electron ε. As a result, we have

It is assumed that the energies of dielectronic doorway states relative to the
threshold is given by εα + εβ - εγ. A more accurate value can be obtained by using mean
ﬁeld energies (conﬁguration energies) of doorway conﬁgurations in Eq.(10). Therefore
we used the conﬁguration energy in the calculation of capture cross sections.

Equation (7) is directly applicable to targets with closed-shell ground states. If the

target ground state contains partially occupied orbitals, a factor

be introduced on the right-hand side of Eq. (7). Steps similar to those that lead to
Eq. (7) were used to obtain mean-squared matrix elements of operators between chaotic
many-body states [14, 15].

The chaotic nature of the multiply-excited states Ψν can also be employed to
estimate their radiative widths Γ(r)
ν . Electron-photon interaction is described by a single-
particle dipole operator ˆd. Any excited electron in Ψν may emit a photon, thus leading to
radiative stabilization of this state. The total photo-emission rate Γ(r)

where ωβα = εβ −
is the reduced dipole operator between the orbitals α

iν is the mean occupation number factor. Since Ψν have large numbers of
principal components N, their radiative widths display small 1/√N ﬂuctuations. This
can also be seen if one recalls that a chaotic multiply-excited state is coupled by photo-
emission to many lower-lying states, and the total radiative width is the sum of a large
number of (strongly ﬂuctuating) partial widths. A similar eﬀect is known in compound
nucleus resonances in low-energy neutron scattering [16].

There is a certain similarity between Eqs. (7) and (9) and those for autoionisation
and radiative rates obtained in a so-called conﬁguration-average approximation [17].
In both cases the answers involve squares or products of two-body Coulomb matrix
elements [see the direct and exchange terms in Eq.
(7)], or single-particle dipole
amplitudes [Eq. (9)]. However, there are a number of important diﬀerences between
the present results and the conﬁguration-average approximation. The latter considers
dielectronic recombination and introduces averaging over conﬁgurations as a means of
simplifying the calculation. The DR cross section is averaged over an arbitrary energy
interval ∆ε, and only the conﬁgurations within this energy range contribute to the

average. Eﬀects of conﬁguration mixing as well as level mixing within a conﬁguration
are neglected.

It is important to compare the radiative and autoionisation widths of chaotic
multiply-excited states. Equation (9) shows that Γ(r) is comparable to the single-particle
radiative widths. On the other hand, the autoionisation width Γ(a), is suppressed by a
N −1 relative to that of a typical dielectronic resonance. Therefore, in
factor
systems with dense spectra of chaotic multiply-excited states the autoionisation widths
are small. Physically this happens because the coupling strength of a two-electron
doorway state to the continuum is shared between many complicated multiply-excited
eigenstates. As a result, the radiative width may dominate the total width of the
Γ(a), making their ﬂuorescence yield close to unity.

3.2. Numerical results

Au49+

We present the RR and DR rate coeﬃcients for Au49+ in ﬁgure 3 in the energy range
between 0 to 100 eV. We also included in the same ﬁgure the dielectronic conﬁgurations
producing the resonances and are by solid vertical lines. The position of peaks in the
DR rate corresponds to each of the doubly excited states. It is evident from the ﬁgure
that there is no strong dielectonic conﬁgurations near

the ionization threshold and hence the experiment does not show an enhancement
in the rate coeﬃcients as well as resonance structure in the low energies. We found
the only isolated doubly excited state near the threshold involves 4s excitation is not
particularly strong. However, at higher electron energies, quite a number of resonaces
are observed. Of particular importance are the dielectronic states those produce larger
peaks. We identiﬁed them as the states which involve the inner shell hole. These states
are indicated with the numbers (1,2,3 etc) in the ﬁgure. One of such states found to
appear around 40 eV is 3d4
3/24f 1
5/2 due to which a large peak is observed.
We found in the present ion, these type of conﬁgurations give most contribution to
the recombination rate. Identifying these type of conﬁguration we plotted them with
respect to the ionization threshold in Fig.8. It appears that conﬁgurations are far above
the ionization threshold i.e above 40 eV. To get more evidence if they produce any low
energy resonance we performed a conﬁguration calculation taking only these type of
conﬁgurations into account. We obtained the excited spectrum for all total angular

momentum J resulted from diagonilazation of conﬁguration Hamiltonian. These are
plotted as a function of eigen energies ranging from -4 to 4 a.u. in Fig.9 and -2 to 2 eV
in Fig.10. We found some resonances but they are not particularly strong in nature. It
is also interesting to note that we performed a calculation without including the inner
shell excitations. The results of rate coeﬃcients are shown by circles connected by solid
lines. This shows that the inner shell excitations in this ion plays a crucial role in the
high electron energies and at low electron energies a negligible eﬀect is found. This
because the conﬁgurations are positioned in the higer electron energies (ﬁg. 8).

For the case of Au51+ we found practically no dielectronic states near its ionization
threshold. As mentioned earlier large contributions to the capture cross sections comes
from the dielectronic states involving the inner shell hole (3d) and 4d and 4f excited
orbitals, these are found to be in either side of the ionization threshold. This may be
seen in Fig.4 wehere we have shown the recombination rate (ﬁg. 8). Figure 9 and ﬁgure
10 also indicate that there is not even a single resonance around the threshold. At low
energies the DR and RR rates are nearly equal. At higher energies the enhancement in
DR rate is found due to the presence of conﬁgurations involving the inner shell hole.
The position of each peaks in the DR rate coeﬃcients corresponds to the position of
dilectronic conﬁgurations and are indicated by vertical solid lines.

Also we show a lots of structures and huge peaks in higher electron energies.
We identiﬁed these peaks and found they correspond to the doubly excited states

above threshold. Due to its presence it is expectecd that one will obtain higher
recombination rate which we justiﬁed here. The experiment in the low energy found
huge enhancement and around 10 isolated resonances of which 3 resonances are
strong. Our conﬁguration interaction calculation shows that these states produce
three resonances as shown in Fig. 10 between 0 and 1 eV of electron energy. The
hole spectrum is shown in Fig 9. It is also interesting that when we switched oﬀ the
inner shell excitation in our calculation there is signiﬁcant change in the magnitude
of DR rates throughout the energy range considerd. This conﬁrms the importance
of inner shell excitations in electron recombination with complex multiply excited states.

Pb53+

The schenerio discussed for Au50+ is even more interesting in the case of Pb53+. The
recombination rate for this ion is presented in the ﬁgure 6. We found that there is huge
DR rate enhancement over RR background particularly in the low energy region. The
huge peaks in the recombination rate are found to be due to the doubly excited states
involving innershell (3d) excitations as indicated earlier. If one looks at the ﬁgure 8,
one can see that just like Au50+, in this system one such state (3d4
5/2)
is positioned at 0.03 a.u. above ionization threshold and the rest conﬁguration of this
kind are above and below the ionization threshold.

This conﬁguration at threshold produces huge contributions to the recombination

It
may be mentioned that the elaborate calculation [6] ﬁnds the resonance peaks with a
greater accuracy. However, there is still a discrepency in magnitude in comparison to
the experimental data. They have taken all the rydberg series into account and their
ground state conﬁguration does not include any inner shell hole. To have close look at
their results we compared the present results in the low energy region between 0 to 0.1
eV electron energy with the experimeental data [6] as shown in ﬁgure 7.

We present the new results for recombination rate of Au52+. Figure 11 shows the
recombination rates as a function of electron energy. We also display the position of

-1 to 4 a.u. with respect to the ionization threshold (table 1) of this ion.
It may
be seen that there are not many doubly excite states so as multiply excited states
near the ionization threshold. However, similar to the other ions discussed above
we found the dielectronic conﬁgutrations involving an inner shell excitations of type

a.u.. Taking these coﬁgurations involving inner shell hole we performed a conﬁguration
calculation. Our calculation shows that these dielectronic states mix with each other
quite comfortablly. To study the mixing we plotted the weights of these dielectronic
states in Fig. 12. This ﬁgure indicates that there is a regular mixing between these
states since the weights has gone down signiﬁcantly from 1. This ﬁgure also indicates
that these states spread largly on the energy scale. To estimate the spreading width we
calculated the mean-squared components and plotted them as a function of basis state
energy. The statistics of the meansquared components is well approximated by Breit-
Wigner (B-W) formula (Fig. 13). From the BW ﬁtting we estimated the spreading
width is 0.85 a.u. which deﬁnes the energy range within which strong mixing takes
[7, 18]. Using this value of the
place.
spreading width

In the case of Au25+, it was about 0.5 a.u.

we performed another calculation since we believe that this value gives an estimate
of the real spreading of the doubly excited states. The results are shown as solid lines in
the calculation. The most striking feature in this curve is that there is an enhancement
of the DR rate over RR (dotted line). Although the dielectronic states are positioned far
from the ionization threshold, but they show a substantial mixing with each other. We
believe this mixing leads to an enhancement of DR rate ove RR in this ion. It will be
more interesting if more theoretical calculations as well as experimental measurements
are performed for a complete understanding of this system.

4. Summary and outlook

In summary, we ﬁnd the the inner shell excitations paly a major role in electron
recombination with multiply charged complex ions. The inclusion of the inner shell
hole signiﬁcantly changes the magnuitude of DR rates throughout the energy range
considered. In U28+, a similar observation has been reported by us [9]. However, we
found in Au50+ and Pb53+ the dielectronic conﬁgurations involving an inner shell hole

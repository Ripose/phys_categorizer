We report on measurements of the radiative properties of cold 87Rb atoms close to a dielectric-
vacuum interface. This is the ﬁrst observation of a quantum electrodynamic (QED) modiﬁcation of
radiative properties in vacuum near a dielectric surface. A cloud of cold atoms was created using
a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and optical molasses cooling. Evanescent waves (EW) were used to
observe the behavior of the atoms near the surface. We observed an increase of the natural linewidth
with up to 25% with respect to the free-space value. We attribute this to QED broadening and
level shifts, as well as local Stark shifts near the surface. By varying the characteristic EW length
we have observed a position dependence characteristic for QED.

INTRODUCTION

An electronically excited atom (or molecule) can de-
cay to the ground state by spontaneous emission. The
characteristic rate at which this occurs is not simply
an intrinsic property of the atom but also depends on
the environment. The spontaneous emission rate is pro-
portional to the density of electromagnetic ﬁeld modes
(DOS, or “density of states”), which is determined by
the electromagnetic boundary conditions. The DOS can
thus be modiﬁed, and with it the spontaneous emission
rate. The boundary conditions imposed by the environ-
ment not only change the radiative linewidth but also
induce energy level shifts and thus change the transition
frequencies. These include the electrostatic or Van der
Waals shift, the Casimir-Polder shift (modiﬁcation of the
Lamb shift), and resonant radiative shifts. For a review
see, e.g. Ref. [1].

Modiﬁed spontaneous emission was ﬁrst observed by
Drexhage [2, 3], using dye monolayers separated from an
interface by fatty acid layers. Both inhibited and en-
hanced spontaneous emission have since then been ob-
served by others in a variety of geometries and circum-
stances [4, 5, 6, 7]. Remarkably, the radiative linewidth of
an atom in vacuo at a distance of the order of an optical
wavelength from a dielectric surface has never been in-
vestigated experimentally. Energy level shifts have been
studied for atom inside cavities [8, 9] and in vapor cells,
using selective reﬂection spectroscopy [10, 11]. The situ-
ation of an atom in front of a distant mirror has recently
been investigated using a single trapped ion. Both the
broadening of the radiative linewidth and energy level
shifts have been reported for this system [12, 13].

In this paper we experimentally investigate the radia-

to a glass surface, at a distance on the order of an op-
tical wavelength. Using our method of evanescent-wave
spectroscopy [14] we have observed linewidth broadening
with contributions from both QED broadening and level
shifts.

II. METHOD: EVANESCENT-WAVE
SPECTROSCOPY

The radiative linewidth Γ is proportional to the power
spectral density of the vacuum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations at the
position of the atom [15], i.e. the local DOS. The proxim-
ity of a dielectric surface imposes a boundary condition
on the ﬁeld, changing the DOS. This leads to a modiﬁca-
tion of Γ and to energy level shifts [7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17,
18]. Both the linewidth broadening and the level shifts
are signiﬁcant mainly at distances z . λ = λ/2π, where
λ is the wavelength of the dominant electronic transi-
tion. In our case this is the D2 resonance line of Rb, and
λ = 124 nm.

Therefore we probe the cold atoms near the glass sur-
face using evanescent-wave (EW) spectroscopy [14]. This
method is selectively sensitive to atoms very close to the
surface. An EW appears when our probe beam undergoes
total internal reﬂection at the glass surface with index of
refraction n = 1.51, see Fig. 1. The optical ﬁeld on the
vacuum side decays exponentially with the distance z to
the surface, E(z)
z/ξ). Atoms can absorb light
from the EW, if their distance to the surface is on the or-
der of the decay length z . ξ
λ. The decay length can
be adjusted by changing the angle of incidence θ accord-
2
ing to ξ(θ) = λ(n2 sin
1)−1/2. By adjusting θ we can
thus vary the distance scale at which the atoms interact
with the probe light. By increasing θ further above the
critical angle θc = arcsin n−1, the absorption will occur
closer to the surface, where Γ is more strongly modiﬁed.
For atoms in free space, the absorption proﬁle is given

by a Lorentzian proﬁle, centered at the (free-space)
atomic transition frequency ωeg = c/λ and with a full
width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to the natural
linewidth Γ∞/2π = 6.07 MHz. Both quantities change
in the proximity of the surface, as will be described be-
low. Roughly speaking these z-dependent Lorentzians
become convoluted with the EW energy density U (z)
∝
exp(
2z/ξ). We expect the width of the resulting ab-
sorption proﬁle to increase with the angle of incidence θ.
In the experiment we measured this by tuning an EW
probe laser across the proﬁle and measuring the absorp-
tion.

FIG. 1: Scheme of the experiment. A weak evanescent-wave
probe beam is reﬂected from the prism surface and collected
on a photodiode. The reference beam has equal power but by-
passes the vacuum cell. The diﬀerence photocurrent of probe
and reference beams yields the absorption signal, typically
a fraction of 10−3 − 10−4 of the probe. A second reference
beam (not shown) was used to monitor variations in the probe
power. We also collect the ﬂuorescence from the MOT to nor-
malize for shot to shot variations of the number of atoms.

The major part of our experimental setup has been
described previously [19]. We produced clouds of cold
87Rb atoms using magneto-optical trapping inside a ultra
10−10mbar). After
high vacuum cell (base pressure p
postcooling in optical molasses we ended up with about
107 atoms, at a temperature of 9 µK. At this temper-
3
ature the Doppler width is 90 kHz (FWHM). The cooling
lasers were then switched oﬀ and the atoms fell down to-
ward the surface of a glass prism, about 3.6 mm below.
The center of the cloud reached the prism surface and
the EW spot after 27 ms. Just before hitting the surface,
the atoms brieﬂy interact with a weak, p-polarized, EW
probe beam, see Fig. 1. The intensity of the probe was
kept well below the saturation intensity to avoid power
broadening. Using 0.35 µW and a waist of about 1 mm,
the maximum saturation parameter was s

0.08.

The probe beam was derived from a home-built diode
F ′ = (1, 3) crossover
laser system, locked to the F = 2
resonance in the D2 line of 87Rb (780 nm). We used
an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) to shift the probe

sending it into the cell, a fraction of the probe beam
was split oﬀ and sent to a photodiode as a reference.
After total internal reﬂection on the prism surface the
probe beam was focused on a second photodiode. The
photocurrents of the two photodiodes were subtracted to

The diﬀerence photocurrent was ampliﬁed by a
low-noise current ampliﬁer (Femto, LCA-100K-50M,
50 MV/A transimpedance) and sent through a low-pass
ﬁlter (RC = 1 ms) to further reduce the noise. All pho-
todiode signals, including a power monitor and a MOT
ﬂuorescence monitor were acquired using a digital stor-
age oscilloscope. The latter two signals were used to nor-
malize the absorption signals for variations in the probe
power and shot-to-shot variations in the number of cold
atoms.

In Fig. 2 we show a typical EW absorption time trace
with the probe beam tuned near resonance, for an an-
gle of incidence θi = θc + 0.52◦. The signal has been
averaged 100
to reduce the noise. Without ﬁltering,
the absorption signal has a Gaussian shape due to the
velocity distribution of the falling atoms. However, in
order to suppress slow drifts in the diﬀerence photocur-
rent we used AC coupling (i.e. a high-pass ﬁlter) on the
oscilloscope. As a result the Gaussian signal has been
distorted. Furthermore it is superposed on an exponen-
tially decaying transient originating from switching on
the probe beam.

IV. DATA PROCESSING

Despite the signal distortion, we can extract the am-
plitude and width of the original Gaussian by ﬁtting the
known shape of the ﬁltered time trace. We took the ﬁtted
height of the Gaussian as the measure for the amount of
absorption. The Gaussian width is essentially constant.
Thus, the height of the peak is proportional to the ab-
sorbed EW power, which depends on the EW detuning
and the angle of incidence.

For a given angle of incidence we measured time traces
for diﬀerent detunings of the EW probe. The ﬁtted Gaus-
sian height as a function of probe detuning yields an ab-

a Gaussian with a ﬁxed width ∆/2π = 1 MHz and a
Lorentzian with variable width Γ.

The ﬁxed Gaussian linewidth accounts for the ﬁnite
spectral width of the probe laser. Our grating stabilized
diode laser system has a spectral linewidth comparable
to the observed atomic linewidth broadenings [20, 21].
We determined the laser linewidth in a separate exper-
iment by observing the beat note between two similar
but independently locked diode lasers on a photodiode.
The observed decoherence of the beat signal was well de-
scribed by a Gaussian with a width of 1 MHz. This is the
linewidth at short (ms) time scales. For longer timescales
we rely on the feedback loop of the laser locking electron-
ics.

The Lorentzian linewidth Γ contained in the Voigt pro-
ﬁle is a ﬁt parameter. We performed measurements of the
absorption proﬁle several times for two diﬀerent angles of
θc = 0.16◦ and 0.52◦). For each absorption
incidence (θ
proﬁle we ﬁnd one value for Γ. The results are shown in
Fig. 4. For larger angles, the absorbed power became
too small compared to the noise, due to the decreasing
EW volume. The vertical error bars in Fig. 4 are entirely
determined by the scatter of the datapoints as seen in
Fig. 3.

V. THEORY FOR Γ(z)

We will now compare the measured θ-dependence of
the linewidth to QED calculations. When the atom
approaches the dielectric surface, both the radiative
linewidth Γ and the resonance frequency ωeg change in a
z-dependent way. The latter also appears as a broadening
in the experiment because the evanescent wave performs
an integration over z.

The absorption from the EW probe beam can be cal-
culated by performing a spatial integration of the photon
scattering rate over the vacuum half space z > 0. The
photons that are scattered out of the EW by atoms are
missing from the reﬂected probe beam so that the reﬂec-
tivity drops below unity. This approach works well if the

Lorentzian width but also multiplies into the photon scat-
tering rate, thus increasing the on-resonance rate. This
eﬀect tends to favor the detection of atoms near the sur-
face.

The z-dependence of the laser detuning δm(z) in
Eq. (8) accounts for the energy level shifts by unequal
amounts for the ground and excited states. The shift
of the ground 5S1/2 state is dominated by the Van der
3 /z3. The shift of the excited 5P3/2 state
Waals shift
is more complicated, containing also a resonant compo-
nent with oscillatory z-dependence. We have used ex-
pressions for the shifts of both the ground and the excited
states from Ref. [16], using transition line strengths taken
from Ref. [22]. We have extended the expressions from
[16] to account for hyperﬁne structure. Furthermore we
have multiplied the results by a factor (n2
1)/(n2 + 1),
because our surface is a dielectric instead of a mirror.
This is known to be correct in the nonretarded limit [23],
which gives the dominant contribution in the experiment.
It is evident from Eq. (8) that the absorption proﬁle is
a convolution of Lorentzians with diﬀerent widths, am-
plitudes, and central frequencies. The resulting absorp-
tion proﬁles are strictly speaking no longer Lorentzian.
We have numerically calculated the expected absorp-
tion proﬁles using Eq. (8).
In practice the deviation
from a Lorentzian is suﬃciently small that we can ﬁt
a Lorentzian to the calculated proﬁles. The ﬁtted widths
are plotted in Fig. 4, together with the measured widths.
In the same Figure we also show the result of the cal-
culation if we do not take the level shifts into account.
Clearly, the eﬀect of the level shifts on the observed
linewidth is comparable with the direct broadening ef-
fect.

−

From the Figure we also see that the observed broad-
ening of up to about 25% is larger than the calculated
broadening by about a factor two. This cannot be ex-
plained by the most obvious sources of spurious broaden-
ing. These include Doppler broadening (< 2%), Zeeman
broadening due to a spurious magnetic ﬁeld (< 3%), and
power broadening (< 0.5%). Furthermore these broad-
ening mechanisms do not show the observed signature of
increasing with the angle of incidence. A drift of the laser
frequency can be excluded by the same argument, plus
the free-space data point.

A possible mechanism that would have the correct sig-
nature is transit time broadening. To investigate this we
numerically integrated the time-dependent optical Bloch
equations for an atom moving through the EW ﬁeld. We

5

−

made the approximation that the atom is a two-level sys-
tem. First, the known ground state level shift was used to
solve for the accelerated motion z(t) towards the surface.
This solution was then used to deﬁne a time-dependent
Rabi-frequency Ω1(z(t)) = Ω10 exp(
2z(t)/ξ), and sim-
ilarly for the detuning δ(z(t)), and radiative linewidth
Γ(z(t)). Using these time dependent parameters we nu-
merically integrated the optical Bloch equations to obtain
the time evolution of the Bloch vector (u(t), v(t), w(t)).
Note that power broadening is naturally included in
this method. The number of photons scattered by the
atom on its way down to the surface was obtained as
Ω1(t)v(t)dt [24]. Again an averaging over the magnetic
m-levels was performed. Finally the probe detuning was
R
varied and a Lorentzian ﬁt to the obtained absorption
proﬁle was performed, as before. The results of the Bloch
equation approach are also shown in Fig. 4. The two
calculations yield very similar results. This shows that
transit time broadening does not explain the discrepancy
between calculations and measurements.

∼

As a tentative explanation we invoke the presence of
local Stark shifts caused by charged or polarized particles
on the surface. Based on a straightforward model calcula-
tion we ﬁnd that a surface charge density of 45e/λ2 yields
a 10% linewidth increase. Remarkably, such a charge
density corresponds to an average distance between the
charges of order
100 nm, which is just the distance scale
to which our experiment is very sensitive. These calcu-
lations only weakly reproduce the angular dependence
shown by the data. Recently McGuirk et al. have re-
ported that Rb adsorbed on a Si or Ti surface generates
local Stark shifts that were measurable as a change in
the trapping frequency of their magnetic trap [25]. The
authors mention that similar eﬀects on a glass surface
like ours are very small. However, there may be other
charged or polarized adsorbates on the surface. Our ex-
periment is complementary to Ref. [25] in the sense that
the latter measures a global eﬀect, whereas our experi-
ment is sensitive only to local variations of the electric
ﬁelds. Unfortunately we have no detailed information
about possible adsorbates to make a more quantitative
analysis.

VII. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have observed a broadening of the
natural linewidth of the D2 resonance line of 87Rb. This
broadening was a combined eﬀect of QED linewidth
broadening and level shifts due to the proximity of a di-
electric surface. The observed broadening of up to 25%
was about twice that expected from QED calculations.
The most likely candidate to explain this discrepancy are
local Stark shifts due to charged or polarized adsorbates
on the surface.

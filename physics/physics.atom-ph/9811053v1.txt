Abstract. Two problems incorporating a set of horizontal linear potentials crossed
by a sloped linear potential are analytically solved and compared with numerical
results: (a) the case where boundary conditions are speciﬁed at the ends of a ﬁnite
interval, and (b) the case where the sloped linear potential is replaced by a piecewise-
linear sloped potential and the boundary conditions are speciﬁed at inﬁnity. In the
approximation of small gaps between the horizontal potentials, an approach similar
to the one used for the degenerate problem (Yurovsky V A and Ben-Reuven A 1998 J.
Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 31 1) is applicable for both problems. The resulting
scattering matrix has a form diﬀerent from the semiclassical result obtained by taking
the product of Landau-Zener amplitudes. Counterintuitive transitions involving a
pair of successive crossings, in which the second crossing precedes the ﬁrst one along
the direction of motion, are allowed in both models considered here.

Introduction

Transitions in multistate curve crossing may be represented intuitively as a sequence
of two-state crossings and avoided crossings. In the absence of turning points near the
crossings, one would expect that the crossings should occur in the causal ordering of
the crossing points along the direction of motion (see dashed arrow in ﬁgure 1). It is,
however, known from quantum close-coupling calculations that certain counterintuitive
transitions may also be allowed [1, 2, 3], in which the causal arrangement may be
broken, letting the second crossing point precede the ﬁrst one with respect to the
direction of motion (see solid arrow in ﬁgure 1). Such transitions are generally
forbidden in analytical semiclassical theories of multistate curve crossing.

The concept of counterintuitive transitions [1, 2, 3] has recently received some
attention in the theory of cold atom collisions, in particular regarding the problem of
incomplete optical shielding (or suppression) of loss-inducing collisions (see [2, 3, 4]
and references therein). Optical shielding of a colliding pair of cold atoms is attained
by subjecting an atom to a laser ﬁeld with the laser frequency shifted to the blue of an
asymptotic atomic resonance frequency. The laser ﬁeld couples the ground molecular
state to a repulsive excited molecular state (which correlates asymptotically to the
state in which one of the atoms is excited). According to the ordinary (single crossing)
Landau-Zener (LZ) theory [5], the radiative coupling forms a repulsive barrier which

2

diverts and reﬂects the atoms approaching each other in their ground states. This
theory predicts an exponential decrease of the penetration (transmission) probability
as the laser power is increased. Experiments indicate, however, that this shielding
eﬃciency saturates at a certain “hangup” value, in which the transmission probability
stays ﬁnite.

In some situations the optical shielding eﬀect can be explained by a semiclassical
multiple-crossing model, associated with a pair of transitions of the intuitive kind
involving partial-wave channels [4]. But in other situations, in which the former
transitions are impeded by various constraints (e.g., centrifugal barriers), it is possible,
as demonstrated by close-coupling calculations [2], to attribute the incomplete
shielding eﬀect to transitions of the counterintuitive type.

In semiclassical approaches, transition amplitudes in multistate systems are usually
constructed from products of single-crossing (or non-crossing) LZ amplitudes [6, 7].
As already stated, counterintuitive transitions are forbidden in such approaches.
Even in exactly-soluble models, such as the Demkov-Osherov model [8], in which the
semiclassical theory provides exact transition amplitudes, counterintuitive transitions
are forbidden. This conclusion holds for non-degenerate channel potentials.
In a
recent publication [1], the Demkov-Osherov model has been extended to the case in
which some of the horizontal channel potentials are degenerate. A major observation
of that work is that an abrupt change occurs in the transition amplitudes, as the gap
between two such parallel potentials narrows to zero, making all transitions possible.
Also, in this limit, the transition amplitudes are no longer representable as a products
of single-crossing LZ amplitudes. The range over which the transition occurs seems
to diverge on approaching degeneracy.

The Demkov-Osherov model is rather unusual, requiring a set of ﬂat (horizontal)
parallel potentials crossing a single linear sloped potential. All potentials are assumed
to retain these properties to inﬁnity, disregarding standard boundary conditions used
in scattering theory. This peculiar property, combined with the observations on the
passage to degeneracy, have led us to inquire whether a modiﬁcation of the potentials
at the far wings, away from the crossing region, may lead to a correction of the
Demkov-Osherov results, making the counterintuitive transitions allowable when the
potential gap between the ﬂat channels becomes suﬃciently small.

We have found that this is indeed the case in the two modiﬁed models we have
solved.
In one model (described in section 2 below), the domain of the model is
truncated, conﬁning it to a ﬁnite range, with boundary conditions deﬁned at its edges.
In the other model (described in section 3), the single-sloped potential is replaced by
a piecewise-linear potential (see ﬁgure 1), constructed of three connected segments
(one ﬁnite central segment at the transition range, and two semi-inﬁnite segments in
the wings). We show here, with the help of an analytical perturbation theory, that
both models allow for counterintuitive transitions. The probability of these transitions
diminishes as the gap between the adjacent horizontal potentials is increased. These
results, derived from the analytical theory, are compared with numerical solutions of
the associated quantum close-coupling equations in section 4.

2.1. Statement of the problem

Consider a sloped linear potential crossing a set of horizontal potentials (ﬁgure 1),
bunched into some quasi-degenerate groups. (The criteria deﬁning quasi-degeneracy
will be speciﬁed below.) The case of exact degeneracy may be reduced to the non-
degenerate problem in the manner described in [1] and is therefore not considered
here.

Let us denote as |0i the (internal) channel state with the sloped potential V0, and
as |jνi the channels with horizontal potentials Vjν , where 1 ≤ j ≤ m denotes a group
of quasi -degenerate states and 1 ≤ ν ≤ dj denotes a state within the group. The
states are arranged so that Vjν < Vjν′ for ν < ν′ and Vjν < Vj′ν′ for j < j′ and all ν
and ν′. The origin on the external coordinate axis R is chosen as the classical turning
point on the sloped potential, so that V0 = E0 − f R, where E0 is the total collision
energy and f is the repulsive force. The collision energy also determines the highest
open channel, with Vndn < E0 (n ≤ m). The problem is considered with boundary
conditions deﬁned on a ﬁnite interval −R′ < R < R′′.

(Atomic units are used here and in what follows.) Here µ is the reduced mass, and
the coupling constants gjν are assumed real and R-independent. Without loss of
generality, we can also assume that the horizontal potential channels are not coupled
directly to each other (see [8]).

The solution presented in [1] for the non-degenerate case is applicable to the system

discussed here if all the following conditions hold:

The scattering matrix (see (5.2) in [1]) may then be rewritten, using the present

The elements of the scattering matrix (2.5) have the form of a product of LZ
amplitudes. The counterintuitive transitions are forbidden here, as can be seen from
the last equality of (2.5).

The situation changes once condition (2.4) is removed; i.e., if the quasi-degenerate
states are close enough, given a certain truncation range. We show here that, under
appropriate conditions, one can treat this case by starting from the approach described
in [1] for the degenerate problem.

Thus, the non-interacting channels (κ 6= 0) will be coupled with other channels in this
quasi-degenerate group by the non-diagonal elements of the matrix (2.9). In the case
of strict degeneracy, Vjν is ν-independent and the matrix (2.9) is then diagonal, as
required in [1].

2.2. Perturbation theory

Let us solve the equations (2.10)-(2.12) under conditions in which the non-diagonal
elements of the potential matrix (2.9) may be considered as a small perturbation. The
orthogonality of the matrix A(j)
κν allows us to evaluate the magnitude of these elements
in terms of characteristic width of the quasi-degenerate group, ∆Vj, deﬁned as

Thus, a small ∆Vj means a weak perturbation.

The unperturbed equations are similar to those used in the degenerate case (see
[1]). The unperturbed equations (2.10) are uncoupled. Therefore the curve-crossing
problem has the following unit-ﬂux normalized plane-wave solutions

The unperturbed equations (2.11) and (2.12) describe the non-degenerate linear curve-
crossing problem considered in [1]. Thus the remaining solutions of the unperturbed
problem may be expressed in terms of the fundamental solutions aj (R) and b (R),
introduced in [1]. The solution, containing a unit-ﬂax incoming wave in the state |0i,
and an outgoing wave containing all other coupled states, has the form

The solution containing unit-ﬂux incoming waves in the states |jκi′ may be
constructed using other choices for s±l†. So, the solutions representing waves incoming
from the negative R direction have the form

The evaluation of the perturbation matrix elements connecting the unperturbed
wavefunctions (2.16)-(2.19) and (2.14) includes an integration over R of the products
of the exponential function from (2.14) with aj (R). (One does not have to evaluate
similar integrals with b (R), since the states |0i and |jκi′, with κ 6= 0, are not coupled.)

The transitions between the unperturbed states are negligible if the matrix elements
(2.21) and (2.24) are small compared to a unit. Since Skk′ ≤ 1, the matrix elements
(2.21) are small if the functions (2.22) are small. This imposes the following restrictions

Thus, if these conditions are obeyed, the transitions in a truncated quasi-degenerate

where Sk′k are deﬁned by (2.23) or (5.2) of [1]. The scattering matrix (2.28) cannot
be represented in the semiclassical form as a product of LZ amplitudes, and allows for
counterintuitive transitions (k′ = −k < 0, ν′ < ν).

3. Piecewise-linear problem

3.1. Transitions in the external regions

In the previous section it was shown that transitions in the quasi-degenerate system
conﬁned to a ﬁnite vicinity of the crossing points, deﬁned by the conditions (2.25),

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

8

may be described by the scattering matrix for the degenerate system (2.28) and (2.29).
However, transitions between the quasi-degenerate states do not stop at the edges of
this vicinity. Transitions in the external regions beyond this vicinity ultimately lead to
the scattering matrix for the non-degenerate system (2.5). Let us introduce orthogonal
matrices B(k)
κν describing the transitions in the external regions (R > R′′ for k > 0 and
R < −R′ for k < 0) between the asymptotic states ||k|νi at inﬁnity and the states
||k|κi′ at the edges of the internal region. These matrices are diagonal with respect
to transitions between states of diﬀerent quasi-degenerate groups since these are fully
accomplished within the internal region when the conditions (2.3) are obeyed. Thus,
the scattering matrix (2.5) for the quasi-degenerate system in the inﬁnite range can
be approximately expressed in the form

vanish, and transitions between the states of the transformed basis cease to exist,

Hereafter we shall consider only the case in which each quasi-degenerate group
consists of two states only (dj = 2, ν = 1, 2, and κ = 0, 1). In this case the remaining

One may expect the inaccuracy of the representation (3.2), (3.1) to be of the
same order as the matrix elements (2.21) and (2.24). However, the inaccuracy is

independent on R′ and R′′. This means that the corresponding errors in the transition
amplitudes in the central and external regions cancel each other in this case of a linear
sloped potential. Therefore, the elements B(k)
κν provide an estimate of the transition
amplitudes in the external regions, to the same accuracy as that provided by the
scattering matrix of the degenerate case for the transition amplitudes in the central
region. The amount of inaccuracy may be estimated by the matrix elements (2.21)
and (2.24).

and B(−j)

The orthogonality conditions are suﬃcient to determine the matrix B(±j)
for
dj = 2 only, since only in a two-dimensional space a given vector (the row B(±j)
)
has only one unit vector orthogonal to it (up to a sign σ±). The relative signs of
B(+j)
are chosen so as to produce minimal residuals on substitution to
1ν
(3.1), the absolute signs being insigniﬁcant.
In the case of a dj-dimensional space
with dj > 2 there are dj − 1 mutually orthogonal vectors which are orthogonal to the

3.2. Total scattering matrix

As was shown in the previous subsection, the scattering matrix for the quasi-
degenerate linear problem may be approximately represented as a product of the
scattering matrix for a degenerate problem, describing transitions in a ﬁnite vicinity
of the crossing points, and the matrices B(k)
κν , describing transitions in the external
wings. This fact allows us to consider a piecewise-linear problem (see ﬁgure 1), in which
the sloped potential consists of three segments of varying slopes (−f ′ at R < −R′,
−f at −R′ < R < R′′, and −f ′′ at R > R′′). If R′, R′′, and ∆Vj obey the conditions
(2.26), we can associate the transitions at R < −R′ with the matrix B(−j)
(f ′), at
−R′ < R < R′′ with Skk′ (f ) , and at R > R′′ with B(j)
κν (f ′′). The f arguments refer
to the forces with which these matrices should be evaluated. The total scattering
matrix can then be written as

In the limit f ′ = f ′′ = f these amplitudes become smaller than (3.5), which serves as
a measure of the inaccuracy of this approximation.

Of special interest is the case in which the potential V0 in one of the external
wings is horizontal (f ′ = 0 or f ′′ = 0). In this case the present approach is formally
inapplicable, since the ﬁnite gap between V0 and the other potentials does not allow to
neglect the interaction even at inﬁnity and to set the asymptotic boundary conditions
with incoming ﬂux in one channel only. This case may be treated by assuming that the
interaction constants gjν are gradually turned oﬀ towards inﬁnity. This assumption is
in agreement with real physical situations. For example, the laser beam inducing the
coupling of atomic states, has a ﬁnite width, very large in terms of atomic dimensions.
An adiabatically-slow turning on of the interaction makes the system stay in the
same adiabatic state. These states are obtained by diagonalization of the potential
matrix including the interactions. If the width of the quasi-degenerate group satisﬁes
the condition (2.26) with pj = 0, and the potential V0 is far distanced from other
potentials [the conditions (2.3) being suﬃcient for this case], the adiabatic states are
nothing else but the states |jκi′ introduced in (2.7).
In the case of dj = 2, the
adiabatic energy of the interacting channel state |j0i′ and V0 lie in the opposite sides
of the adiabatic energy of the non-interacting channel state |j1i′. Since the adiabatic
potentials do not cross each other the state |j0i′ corresponds adiabatically to |j2i as
R → ∞ and to |j1i as R → −∞. This fact is also known in the theory of “dark
states” (see [10] and references therein). A more detailed analysis yields

B(+j)

κν = 1 − δκ,ν−1,

B(−j)

κν = (−1)ν δκ,ν−1

(3.9)

which coincide with the limiting values of (3.3) and (3.4) as f ′ → 0 or f ′′ → 0. Thus,
the results of the present theory are applicable to this case as well.

4. Comparison with numerical results

In order to test the approximations used in the present theory, the scattering matrix
was evaluated by using the analytical theory provided here, and also calculated
numerically, by using the invariant imbedding method [11] to solve the associated
close-coupling equations, for a speciﬁc model. This model involves only two horizontal

11

potentials (d1 = 2) forming one quasi-degenerate group (n = m = 1). The parameters
of the model were chosen so as to simulate an optical collision of metastable Xe atoms
(see [4]). Here µ = 66 AMU (1 AMU = 1.6605 × 10−27 Kg), collision energy E = 10−9
au (1 au = 4.3597 × 10−18 J), and f = 2.17 × 10−10 au/a0 (a0 = 0.0529177 nm).
The coupling constants, which are dependent on the laser intensity I, were taken as
g11 = 9.6 × 10−9[I(W/cm2)]1/2 au and g12 = 5.6 × 10−9[I(W/cm2)]1/2 au. The ﬁrst
criterion in (2.3) requires a large value of R′ = R′′ = 6 × 103 a0. This value, dictated
by the small value of the kinetic energy, is larger than the range one would normally
associate with the shielding process simulated by this model.

The results for the truncated linear problem are presented in ﬁgure 2, using three
diﬀerent values of the potential gap. The calculations show that for the small gap
V12 − V11 = 6.7 × 10−12 au (ﬁgure 2a) the expressions (2.28) and (2.29) for the
scattering matrix in the degenerate case are in good agreement with the numerical
results. For the large gap V12 − V11 = 5 × 10−10 au (ﬁgure 2c) the agreement is better
with the expressions (2.5) for the scattering matrix in the non-degenerate case. The
numerical results for the intermediate gap V12 − V11 = 6.7 × 10−11 au (ﬁgure 2b) lie
between the predictions of the two models. The latter case corresponds to the actual
gap between the energies at the crossing points in which the s and d partial-wave
potentials of the lower (metastable) state of Xe cross the p partial-wave potential
of the excited state. At high intensities, however, the numerical results tend to the
predictions of the quasi-degenerate model (as discussed in section 5 below).

The numerical calculations for the piecewise-linear model are somewhat more
tedious, as the gap sizes used here require a very wide integration range, reaching
near-macroscopic dimensions. We have conducted calculations for the case in which
the two wings are ﬂat (f ′ = f ′′ = 0), keeping all other parameters the same as in
the truncated model discussed above. Figure 3 shows two transition elements (the
intuitive one above, the counterintuitive below), demonstrating excellent agreement
between the calculations and the analytical results using (3.6) and (3.9).

5. Discussion

(a) truncation,

We have analytically and numerically solved model problems that are modiﬁcations
of the Demkov-Osherov model of a sloped linear potential curve crossing a set of
horizontal ones. Two types of modiﬁcations were considered:
in
which the boundary conditions are determined at the ends of a ﬁnite interval, and
(b) modiﬁcation of the sloped potential into a piecewise-linear form. The modiﬁed
problems can be treated by using the quasi-degeneracy approximation, which is valid
when the criteria (2.3) and (2.26) are obeyed. This approximation means that the
results of the degenerate model discussed in [1] should be used. This model allows
for counterintuitive transitions. The opposite happens when criteria (2.4) are met.
In this case, in which the transition range lies within the range of the ﬁnite segment
of the sloped potential, the results of the non-degenerate (i.e., the original Demkov-
Osherov) model apply, in which case counterintuitive transitions are forbidden.
It
follows from the present analysis that counterintuitive transitions are generally quite
common in situations involving a sloped potential crossing several horizontal ones. In
the unmodiﬁed problem (dealt with by the Demkov–Osherov model), contributions
coming from diﬀerent parts of the transition region cancel each other, and lead to the
disappearance of the counterintuitive transitions. Such a compensation does not take
place anymore when the conditions of quasi-degeneracy (2.26) are obeyed.

12

The criteria (2.26) allow for an interpretation that stems from the viewpoint of the
uncertainty principle. Let us denote as ∆pj = µ∆Vj/pj the characteristic diﬀerence
of momenta in the quasi-degenerate group for a given total energy, and as t′ = µR′/pj
and t′′ = µR′′/pj the characteristic times of travelling from R′′ to 0 and from 0 to
R′, respectively. Using this notation, the criteria (2.26) may be written in one of the
following forms,

∆pj max (R′, R′′) ≪ ¯h (1 + λj/π)
∆Vj max (t′, t′′) ≪ ¯h (1 + λj /π) .

(5.1)

The ﬁrst form means that the momenta in the quasi-degenerate states are
indistinguishable at the given coordinate interval. The second one means that the
potential energies of the quasi-degenerate states are indistinguishable for the given
travelling time. The factor (1 + λj/π) describes a broading of the uncertainty as the
coupling increases. As one may see from ﬁgure 2, the higher the intensity becomes,
the larger is the value of ∆Vj applicable in the quasi-degenerate approximation.

The expansion of the applicability region in the quasi-degenerate model as the
coupling constants increase leads to an interesting property of the transmission
amplitudes, that may be interpreted as a stabilization eﬀect. Let us consider, for
example, a case in which gj1 = gj2 = . . . = gjdj = d−1/2
gj. As long as the
gjν are small, the criteria (2.4) are obeyed, and the system should be considered
as a non-degenerate one. The amplitude of elastic transmission in the state |jνi
is S−jν,jν = exp (−λjν ) (see (2.5)). This amplitude decreases exponentially as the
coupling constant increases. Upon further increasing gjν conditions (2.4) are violated,
but conditions (2.26) for the applicability of the quasi-degeneracy approximation are
validated. The transmission amplitude S−jν,jν = 1 − [1 − exp (λj )] /dj (see (2.28)) is
close to unity if dj is large. Moreover, the higher the coupling constants, the more
states may be bunched into the quasi-degenerate group, i.e., dj becomes larger, and
the closer to unity this transmission amplitude becomes.

6. Conclusions

We consider here two types modiﬁcations of the exactly-soluble Demkov-Osherov
model of a sloped linear potential curve crossing a set of horizontal ones:
(a) Truncation of the domain of the model with the boundary conditions speciﬁed at
the truncation points.
(b) Deformation of the sloped potential into a piecewise -linear shape.
These two modiﬁed problems are considered in the quasi -degeneracy approximation.
The main results of the present analysis are that the transition amplitudes in both
modiﬁed models are not to be represented in the semiclassical form of a product of
LZ amplitudes, and that both models allow for counterintuitive transitions, which are
completely forbidden in semiclassical theories, as well as in the original analytically-
soluble Demkov-Osherov model.

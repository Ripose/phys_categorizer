Abstract.

Dielectronic recombination(DR) of lithium-like Ti19+(1s22s) ions via 2s → 2p
core excitations has been measured at the Heidelberg heavy ion storage ring
TSR. We ﬁnd that not only external electric ﬁelds (0 ≤ Ey ≤ 280 V/cm)
but also crossed magnetic ﬁelds (30 mT≤ Bz ≤ 80 mT) inﬂuence the DR via
high-n 2pj nℓ-Rydberg resonances. This result conﬁrms our previous ﬁnding for
isoelectronic Cl14+ ions [Bartsch T et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 3779 (1999)] that
experimentally established the sensitivity of DR to E × B ﬁelds. In the present
investigation the larger 2p1/2 − 2p3/2 ﬁne structure splitting of Ti19+ allowed us
to study separately the inﬂuence of external ﬁelds via the two series of Rydberg
DR resonances attached to the 2s → 2p1/2 and 2s → 2p3/2 excitations of the
Li-like core, extracting initial slopes and saturation ﬁelds of the enhancement.
We ﬁnd that for Ey & 80 V/cm the ﬁeld induced enhancement is about 1.8 times
stronger for the 2p3/2 series than for the 2p1/2 series.

Dielectronic recombination (DR) is a fundamental electron-ion collision process
well known to be important in astrophysical and fusion plasmas (Dubau and Volont´e
1980). It proceeds in two steps

e− + Aq+ → [A(q−1)+]∗∗ → A(q−1)+ + hν

(1)

where in the ﬁrst step the initially free electron is captured into a bound state nℓ
of the ion with simultaneous excitation of a core electron. This dielectronic capture
(DC, time inverse of autoionization) can only occur if the energy E of the incident
free electron in the electron-ion center-of-mass (c.m.) frame matches the resonance
condition E = Eres = Ed − Ei where Ei and Ed are the total energies of all bound
electrons in the initial and in the doubly excited state, respectively. Employing
the principle of detailed balance the DC cross section can be calculated from the
autoionization rate Aa(d → i) for a transition from the doubly excited state d to the
initial state i:

σ(DC)(E) = S0

with S0 = 7.88 × 10−31cm2eV2s, statistical weights gd and gi and Γd =  [Pk Aa(d →
k) + Pf ′ Ar(d → f ′)] denoting the total width of the doubly excited state d. The
summation indices k and f ′ run over all states which from d can be either reached
by autoionization or by radiative transitions with rates Aa(d → k) and Ar(d → f ′),
respectively.

In the second step of reaction (1) the new charge state is stabilized by photon
emission from the intermediate doubly excited state, thereby transferring the ion into
a ﬁnal state f below the ﬁrst ionization limit. This radiative stabilization competes
with autoionization which would transfer the ion back into its initial charge state
with the net eﬀect being resonant electron scattering. Accordingly, in order to obtain
the cross section for DR one has to multiply the DC cross section from equation (2)
by the branching ratio [Pf Ar(d → f )]/Γd for radiative stabilization.
Integrating
the resulting expression over the c. m. energy and assuming Γd ≪ Eres yields the
DR resonance strength due to the intermediate state d in the isolated resonance
approximation (Shore 1969), i.e.

In case of ∆n = 0 DR of Li-like ions, i.e. for 1s22s → 1s22p core excitations, the
dominant decay channels of the doubly excited intermediate state (for very high n) can
be identiﬁed as 2pjnℓ → 2snℓ radiative and 2pjnℓ → 2sEresℓ′ autoionizing transitions
with rates denoted as Ar and Anℓ, respectively. Since the radiative transition only
involves the excited core electron, its rate Ar to a good approximation is independent
of the quantum numbers n and ℓ of the excited Rydberg electron. Neglecting all other
transitions such as 2p3/2nℓ → 2p1/2E ′ℓ′ or 2pjnℓ → 2pjn′ℓ′, equation (3) simpliﬁes to

¯σnℓ = (2j + 1)(2ℓ + 1)S0

using the Rydberg resonance energy Eres = En, gd = 2(2j + 1)(2ℓ + 1) and gi = 2;
in the r.h.s approximation A< denotes the lesser of Ar and Anℓ. Autoionizing rates
decrease as ∝ n−3 and even more rapidly with ℓ, such that at a given n the relation
Anℓ > Ar holds only for nℓ-Rydberg states with angular momentum ℓ below a limit
ℓc. Thus (ℓc + 1)2 sublevels dominantly contribute to DR for a given core state j and
consequently for the n-manifold 2pjnℓ of doubly excited states the resonance strength
is given as

¯σn ≈ (2j + 1)[ℓc(n) + 1]2S0

Within this ‘counting of states’ picture the eﬀect of external electric ﬁelds on DR is
readily explained. In external electric ﬁelds Stark mixing of high-ℓ with low-ℓ levels
occurs. This yields autoionization rates which are lower for low-ℓ and higher for high-ℓ
states as compared to the ﬁeld free situation. The net eﬀect is an increase of ℓc, i.e.
an increase of the number of states participating in DR. Since high-n Rydberg states
are more easily perturbed by external electric ﬁelds than low-n states the electric ﬁeld
induced enhancement of DR is stronger for higher-n 2pjnℓ DR resonances.

This eﬀect of external electric ﬁelds on DR was recognized early by Burgess
and Summers (1969) and Jacobs et al (1976). Electric ﬁeld enhancement of DR
was subsequently found in numerous theoretical calculations (Hahn 1997). The ﬁrst
clear experimental veriﬁcation of this eﬀect has been given by M¨uller et al (1986)
who investigated DR in the presence of external ﬁelds (DRF) of singly charged Mg+

ions under controlled conditions. Further DRF experiments with multiply charged
C3+ ions (Young et al 1994, Savin et al 1996) and Si11+ ions (Bartsch et al 1997)
also revealed drastic DR rate enhancements by electric ﬁelds. Especially the Si11+
experiment which employed merged electron and ion beams at a heavy ion storage
ring equipped with an electron cooler produced results with unprecedented accuracy,
enabling a detailed comparison with theory. Whereas the overall agreement between
experiment and theory as for the magnitude of the eﬀect was fair, discrepancies
remained in the functional dependence of the rate enhancement on the electric ﬁeld
strength (Bartsch et al 1997). This ﬁnding stimulated theoretical investigations of the
role of the additional magnetic ﬁeld which in storage ring DR experiments is always
present, since it guides and conﬁnes the electron beam within the electron cooler. In
a model calculation Robicheaux and Pindzola (1997) found that in a conﬁguration
of crossed E and B ﬁelds indeed the magnetic ﬁeld through the mixing of m levels
inﬂuences the rate enhancement generated by the electric ﬁeld through the mixing
of ℓ levels. More detailed calculations (Griﬃn et al 1998a, Robicheaux et al 1998)
conﬁrmed these results. It should be noted that in theoretical calculations by Huber
and Bottcher (1980) no inﬂuence of a pure magnetic ﬁeld (E = 0) on DR was found
up to at least B = 5 T.

Inspired by these predictions we previously performed storage ring DRF
experiments using Li-like Cl14+ ions and crossed E and B ﬁelds (Bartsch et al
1999) where we clearly discovered a distinct eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld strength on
the magnitude of the E-ﬁeld enhanced DR rate. Shortly after that Klimenko and
coworkers (1999) experimentally veriﬁed that for the m-mixing to occur the crossed
E and B arrangement is essential. For the case of parallel B and E ﬁelds, where m
remains a good quantum number, they did not observe any inﬂuence of the magnetic
ﬁeld on the measured recombination signal.

The aim of the present investigation with Li-like Ti19+ is to conﬁrm the novel
E × B ﬁeld eﬀect on DR for a heavier Li-like ion. Because of the strong scaling
of the ﬁne-structure splitting with the nuclear charge the Ti18+(1s22p1/2nℓ) and
Ti18+(1s22p3/2nℓ) Rydberg series of DR resonances are well separated in energy. The
corresponding series limits occur at 40.12 eV and 47.81 eV, respectively (Hinnov et al
1989). This energy diﬀerence is large enough that, in contrast to the Cl14+ experiment,
here our experimental resolution permits to study the eﬀect of external ﬁelds on both
Ti18+(1s22pjnℓ) Rydberg series individually.

The experiments were carried out at the heavy ion storage ring TSR of the Max-
Planck-Institut f¨ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. Here we only give a brief account of the
experimental procedure for DRF measurements. Details will be given in a forthcoming
publication by Schippers et al (2000, and references therein) on DRF measurements
with lithium-like Ni25+ ions.

Beams of 48Ti19+ ions with intensities up to almost 80 µA were stored in the
ring at energies of 4.6 MeV/u. The ion beams were cooled by interaction with a
velocity-matched cold beam of electrons which was conﬁned by a magnetic ﬁeld B;
the direction of B deﬁnes that of the electron beam. The electron beam diameter was
30 mm, while that of the cooled ion beam was of the order of 2 mm. First, as in the
standard tuning procedure of the electron cooler, the electron beam was steered so
that, along the straight interaction region of 1.5 m length, the ion beam travelled on
the electron beam center line and the guiding ﬁeld B pointed exactly along the ion
beam; this minimized the electric ﬁeld in the frame of the ions originating from space
charge and motional (v × B) ﬁelds. A reasonably ‘electric-ﬁeld free’ measurement of

the DR rate coeﬃcient (with an estimated residual ﬁeld of at most ±10 V/cm) could
then be obtained at high energy resolution by switching the energy of the electrons
in the cooler to diﬀerent values. The energy range thus covered in the center-of-
mass frame includes all Ti19+(1s22pjnℓ) ∆n = 0 DR resonances due to the 2s → 2pj
core excitations. Recombined Ti18+ ions were magnetically separated from the parent
Ti19+ beam and detected with an eﬃciency ≥ 95% downbeam from the cooler behind
the ﬁrst bending magnet.

x + B2

Controlled motional electric ﬁelds in the frame of the ions were then applied by
superimposing in the interaction region a deﬁned transverse (horizontal) magnetic
ﬁeld Bx ≪ Bz in addition to the unchanged longitudinal ﬁeld Bz along the ion beam
direction (z). This ﬁeld was generated by the electron-beam steering coils along the
complete straight section of the electron cooler and created a motional electric ﬁeld
Ey = vBx in the frame of the ions at a beam velocity v; the total magnetic ﬁeld
strength (B2
z )1/2, however, remained almost unchanged. Progressively diﬀerent
electric ﬁelds were produced by varying the transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength Bx.
At a given transverse ﬁeld Bx the electron beam (following the magnetic ﬁeld lines)
and the ion beam are misaligned by the small angle Bx/Bz so that the distance
of the ion beam from the center of the electron beam varies along the interaction
region. This leads to unwanted eﬀects due to the electron space charge:
(I) a
variation of the (temperature average) relative velocity between electrons and ions
along the interaction path, resulting in a degraded energy resolution; (II) creation
of an additional electric ﬁeld Ex which, in contrast to the imposed ﬁeld Ey, varies
along the interaction region. Low electron densities were chosen in order to keep
these eﬀects small. With electron currents of 20 mA, measurements were performed
at an electron density of 6.2 × 106 cm−3. The cooler was operated at longitudinal
ﬁeld strengths Bz= 30, 41.8, 60.0 and 80.1 mT. Transverse ﬁelds of |Bx| ≤ 0.7 mT
(measured with an uncertainty of ±3%) were applied, corresponding to controlled
motional electric ﬁelds |Ey| up to 280 V/cm; in all measurements the misalignment
angle was kept below |Bx/Bz| . 0.02. The ratio Ex/Ey of the unwanted electric
space charge ﬁeld and the applied motional ﬁeld is expected to vary linearly along
the interaction region with |Ex/Ey| remaining always below 0.07 for all measurements
with diﬀerent experimental parameters.

Before each energy scan with an imposed electric ﬁeld Ey, ions were injected into
the ring, accumulated and then cooled for 1 s. After that, the cathode potential of the
cooler was oﬀset from cooling by about 1 kV (corresponding to 55 eV in the center-
of-mass frame) and then, the steering coils were set to produce a deﬁned transverse
magnetic ﬁeld Bx. Next, the center-of-mass energy was ramped down from about
55 eV to 1 eV within 4 s thus completing a ﬁrst mini-cycle. After new ion injection
and cooling (at Bx = 0), the next magnetic steering ﬁeld Bx (i.e., next Ey) was
automatically set and a new energy scan started. The mini-cycles, covering one
complete energy scan each, were repeated for a set of pre-chosen magnetic steering
ﬁelds. A grand cycle through typically 11 values of Ey = vBx thus took about 2
minutes and such cycles were repeated until a satisfying level of statistical uncertainty
(below 3% per channel) had been reached.

Sets of recombination rate measurements were made for diﬀerent longitudinal
ﬁelds Bz. Using measured beam currents the spectra were calibrated, reaching an
uncertainty of ±20% for absolute and ±5% for relative rate coeﬃcients. The center-
of-mass energies were determined (with uncertainties below ±1%) from the average
relative velocities of electrons and ions, accounting for the angle between the electron

and the ion beam due to the applied transverse ﬁeld Bx.

A typical set of measurements is presented in ﬁgure 1 and shows the two series
of Rydberg resonances converging to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 core excitation limits. A
signiﬁcant enhancement of the rate coeﬃcient with increasing electric ﬁeld Ey is
observed for high Rydberg states n & 27, while for the lower-lying resonances the
rate coeﬃcient remains constant.

The enhancement of the DR via high Rydberg states is quantiﬁed by extracting
rate coeﬃcients integrated over diﬀerent energy regions of the measured spectra. The
integrals I1/2(Ey, Bz) and I3/2(Ey, Bz) extend over the energy ranges 33.4–40.57 eV
and 40.57–50 eV, respectively, and represent the high-Rydberg contributions of the
2p1/2nℓ and 2p3/2nℓ series of Rydberg resonances with n ≥ 27. For normalization
purposes we also monitor the integral I0 (integration range 4–24 eV) comprising DR
contributions from lower n. It should be noted that the maximum quantum number of
Rydberg resonances contributing to the measured recombination rate is limited by ﬁeld
ionization in the charge analyzing dipole magnet. Taking into account also radiative
decay of high Rydberg states on the way from the cooler to the dipole magnet, we
estimate the maximum quantum number to be nc = 115.

The high-Rydberg contributions Ij(Ey, Bz) (j = 1/2, 3/2) monotonically increase
with |Ey|, while the lower-n contribution I0(Ey, Bz) remains constant. In order to
provide a quantity for the following discussion that is independent of the normalization
of the individual spectra, we consider ratios Ij /I0 of the high-n to the low-n

The ﬁeld enhancement factors r1/2(Ey, Bz) and r3/2(Ey, Bz) found for diﬀerent
Bz are shown in ﬁgure 2 as a function of |Ey|. The enhancement factors turn out to
be independent of the sign of Ey, as expected. The formula

r(ﬁt)
j

(Ey, Bz) = 1 + sj(Bz)Ej (Bz) {1 − exp[−Ey/Ej(Bz)]}

(7)

which we have ﬁtted to the measured enhancement factors, provides a useful
parameterization of our data. The parameters which have been varied during the
ﬁts (at ﬁxed values of Bz) are the saturation ﬁeld Ej (Bz) and the initial slope sj(Bz);
tangents to r(ﬁt) at Ey = 0, representing the initial slopes are also displayed in ﬁgure
2. We note that the Ey = 0 data points are slightly above the ﬁtted lines. This is
due to the fact that zero applied ﬁeld Ey = 0 still implies a residual electric ﬁeld
. 10 V/cm so that the measured dependence of rj (Ey, Bz) near Ey = 0 is washed
out to some extent. At higher electrical ﬁeld strengths the measured data points drop
below the (dashed) straight lines (cf. ﬁgure 2). This is an indication that the electric
ﬁeld eﬀect is subject to saturation which occurs at higher electric ﬁeld strength where
the mixing of ℓ-levels is complete. Presently, higher electric ﬁelds are not accessible
in our DR experiment. The ﬁt parameter Ej (Bz) indicates how fast the saturation
regime will be reached.

The values for the parameters sj(Bz) and Ej(Bz), which along with their
uncertainties have been obtained from the ﬁts, are displayed in ﬁgures 3a and 3b,
respectively, as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld Bz. Both sj and Ej exhibit a strong
dependence on the strength of the magnetic guiding ﬁeld. The slopes sj decrease with
increasing magnetic ﬁeld both for the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 series of Rydberg resonances.
This conﬁrms our recent ﬁnding for Cl14+ ions (Bartsch et al 1999) where the existence
of a sensitivity of DR to external magnetic ﬁelds in an E × B ﬁeld conﬁguration was
experimentally demonstrated for the ﬁrst time. The parameters Ej increase with
increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength, i.e. at higher Bz the saturation regime will be
reached at higher electric ﬁelds |Ey|.

While the parameters Ej are not markedly diﬀerent for the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 series,
the slopes s3/2 are steeper than the slopes s1/2 (open and closed circles in ﬁgure 3a,
respectively), i.e. the relative increase of the DR line strength is stronger for the 2p3/2
series of Rydberg resonances than for the 2p1/2 series. For a comparison to recent
theoretical predictions (Griﬃn et al 1998a, 1998b) we consider the ratio

R(Ey, Bz) =

I3/2(Ey, Bz) − I3/2(0, Bz)
I1/2(Ey, Bz) − I1/2(0, Bz)

(8)

of absolute Ey induced DR rate enhancements for the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 series of Rydberg
resonances, which is practically independent of the integration ranges used for the
determination of I1/2 and I3/2 as long as they cover nearly all DR resonances aﬀected
by the external ﬁelds. As a function of Ey the ratio R rises up to |Ey| = 80 V/cm
and then essentially stays constant at higher electric ﬁelds. Values hRi averaged over
the interval 80 V/cm≤ |Ey| ≤ 280 V/cm are plotted in ﬁgure 3c which shows that
hRi = 1.77 ± 0.06 independent of Bz.

80 V/cm≤ |Ey| ≤ 280 V/cm as a function of Bz. The error bars correspond
to one standard deviation. The dashed straight line represents the mean value
1.77 ± 0.06.

In view of the fact that for a given n the manifold of 2p3/2nℓ resonances contains
twice as many sublevels that can be mixed by external ﬁelds as the manifold of 2p1/2nℓ
resonances (8n2 vs. 4n2, cf. equation (4)) one expects a value of 2 for the ratio hRi.
We here observe a ratio somewhat lower than 2 similar to the value hRi ∼ 1.5 found
in our experiments with lithium-like Ni25+ ions (Schippers et al 2000). In calculations
for lithium-like Si11+ ions (Griﬃn et al 1998a) and C3+ ions (Griﬃn et al 1998b)
ratios even less than 1 have been found. This has been attributed to the electrostatic
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between the 2p and the nℓ Rydberg electron in the
intermediate doubly excited state, which more eﬀectively lifts the degeneracy between
the 2p3/2nℓ than between the 2p1/2nℓ levels. Our experimental results suggest that
this eﬀect might be weaker than theoretically predicted.

Our data emphasize the relevance of the eﬀect of small magnetic ﬁelds on DR via
high Rydberg levels in conjunction with the well-known electric-ﬁeld enhancement.
This result bears important implications upon the charge state balance of ions in
astrophysical and laboratory plasmas where both, electric and magnetic ﬁelds are
ubiquitous.

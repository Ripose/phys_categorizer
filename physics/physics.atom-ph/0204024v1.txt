Abstract

In the course of exploring some aspects of atom guiding in a hollow, optical ﬁber, a small
negative potential energy well was found just in front of the repulsive or guiding barrier.
This results from the optical dipole and the van der Waals potentials. The ground state
for atoms bound in this negative potential well was determined by numerically solving the
Schr¨odinger eq. and it was found that this negative well could serve as an atom trap. This
trap is referred to as the Annular Shell Atom Trap or ASAT because of the geometry of the
trapped atoms which are located in the locus of points deﬁning a very thin annular shell
just in front of the guiding barrier. A unique feature of the ASAT is the compression of the
atoms from the entire volume to the volume of the annular shell resulting in a very high
density of atoms in this trap. This trap may have applications to very low temperatures
using evaporative cooling and possibly the formation of BEC. Finally, a scheme is discussed
for taking advantage of the de Broglie wavelength to store atoms in a bottle trap based on the
inability of long de Broglie wavelengths to escape through a selective de Broglie wavelength
ﬁlter in the atom bottle trap.

The polarizability of an atom is almost always positive but, it can be negative and some
unusual eﬀects can then be observed. This can occur when a laser or other monochromatic
source is tuned slightly above or to the “blue” of an atomic resonance. The interaction
of the external ﬁeld on the atom through its negative polarizability produces a gradient
dipole force which tends to drive the atom to regions of minimum intensity. Cook and
Hill[1] suggested using an evanescent wave to produce an atom mirror outside of a dielectric.
Zoller, et.al.[2, 3] analyzed the case for a clad, hollow ﬁber in which the external ﬁeld was
conﬁned to the annular region and used the resulting evanescent ﬁeld in the hollow region
to guide atoms.
In what has become known as “blue-guiding”, Renn[4] and Ito[5] have
experimentally demonstrated evanescent wave guiding of rubidium atoms in hollow optical
ﬁbers. A comprehensive review of evanescent light-wave atom optics has been published by
Dowling and Gea-Banacloche[6].

Atom guiding in a hollow, metal-coated optical ﬁber has previously been analyzed[7],[8].
The metal coating is assumed to be a perfect conductor and this provides both simpler
boundary conditions for determining exact solutions of the T M0n modes and maximizes the
evanescent guiding ﬁeld for a given laser electric ﬁeld injected in the annular region of the
ﬁber. A typical potential for this interaction is shown in Fig.1 and includes both the quantum
optical dipole (odp) and the van der Waal’s (vdW) potentials. Here

While Fig.1 is familiar because it shows the repulsive or guiding barrier in front of the
inner wall, a new result is obtained when the energy resolution or magniﬁcation is increased
104. In this case a small, negative potential energy well is observed in Fig.2. This
by
is a result of the vdW potential dominating both very far from and very close to the inner
wall whereas the odp potential dominates in the region where the rising leading-edge of the
pulse in Fig.1 has a strongly positive slope. The reason for the strongly positive slope is
the very fast ”turn-on” of the odp potential here. At the point where the potential has
a maximum, the slope quickly becomes strongly negative and the vdW potential becomes
dominant again. Any atoms on this side of the barrier will quickly be drawn into the wall.
These ﬁgures display 1-dimensional potentials which are radially symmetric but the energy

2

axis in each ﬁgure has a diﬀerent scale. A cross section through the repulsive barrier is shown
in Fig.3, whereas the negative potential energy well is too shallow to be seen on this energy
scale.

When used with a single wavelength odp potential as in eq. 1, the depth of the nega-
tive potential well is comparatively shallow. However, using a two-color odp potential can
signiﬁcantly increase the well depth[10],[11]. The two-color total potential is:

U2 color = Uodp(∆1, E1) + UvdW + Uodp(∆2, E2)

(3)

where the detunings are ∆1 > 0 and ∆2 < 0, and E1 and E2 are the electric ﬁeld amplitudes
in the hollow region for the corresponding laser wavelengths λ1 and λ2, and both wavelengths
are injected into the annular region of the hollow ﬁber. Calculations have shown that the
negative well depth can be increased by factors up to 104. Note that ∆2 is negative and
tuned to the red of the transition frequency.

The 2-color odp potential can be explained using the Red-Blue Pushme-Pullyou resonator
or trap[6]. Blue detuned evanescent radiation pushes atoms away from the wall and toward
regions of lower intensity while red detuned evanescent radiation pulls atoms toward the wall
and higher intensity regions. By careful external focusing, it is possible to achieve a spatial
separation between attractive and repulsive regions in the case of the dielectric slab[10] or
by using a 3-level atom in the quartz microsphere[11]. It is also possible to obtain a useful
spatial separation between the blue and red-detuned light for the two-level atom used here.
While both wave lengths are injected into the annular region of the ﬁber, the two parame-
ters, Ei and ∆i, in eq. 3 determine the characteristics of each evanescent wave. For example,
for the red detuned evanescent wave, the radial dependence of the amplitude can be adjusted
to drop (a negative potential here) before the blue-detuned wave eventually rises for larger
values of r. In moving toward the inner wall, the atom encounters a region containing a red
detuned wave and then, for increasing values of r, enters a diﬀerent region where the blue
detuned wave is also present. As the red odp together with the vdW potential attracts the
atom toward the repulsive barrier, the blue radiation repels the atom as it approaches the
large energy barrier. At some point there is a superposition of forces such that the repulsive
force due to the blue light competes against the attractive forces of both the red odp plus
the vdW potential. If the combined attraction of the latter is greater than the repulsive blue
force, the atom will continue to move closer toward the inner wall and the well will deepen -
vice versa and the well becomes shallower. While the blue odp potential is usually of larger
magnitude, it is important that the combined red forces are ﬁrst encountered at smaller r
values in moving toward the wall so that the negative well depth can be enhanced.

Consider an ensemble of atoms inside the hollow ﬁber. These atoms randomly interact
with the repulsive barrier just in front of the inner wall. Since these interactions are assumed
to be elastic, the atoms must lose energy by collisions with other atoms through the process
of evaporative cooling[9] and many of the remaining atoms will eventually be trapped in
the negative potential well. At high laser powers, the trapped atoms are expected to have
a broad distribution of energies. Because both the negative well and the repulsive barrier
are extremely sensitive to reducing or varying the laser power and/or the laser detuning as
shown in Fig.4. In this case, using eq. 3, ∆1 is adiabatically varied with time, and a series
of time-frozen snapshots are shown for ∆1i where i = 1...5. All other parameters (E1, E2,

3

and ∆2) are held constant. This can provide an additional level of control in that the well
can become deeper, and move toward the inner wall, while the barrier eventually becomes
negative and may be very thin where it actually exists. The hotter atoms escape from the
well preferentially to the inner wall because the barrier has been eliminated or because atom
tunneling through what remains of the barrier provides a signiﬁcant loss mechanism. By
reducing the barrier adiabatically, the evaporative cooling can be made very eﬃcient and
the loss of atoms from the trap can be minimized.

Before calculating the ground-state energy for atoms in this trap, it should be noted that
the ground-state eigenvalue should be as deep as possible. The selectivity of this system is
complex. Following de Broglie’s approach as described by Bohm[12] and modifying it to use
a stationary wave to represent an atom in a stationary state requires that the stationary wave
must ﬁt continuously on itself after going around the radial potential well inside the hollow
ﬁber. This requires an integral number of waves ﬁtting in the above described circumference.
The atoms must be very cold and since their de Broglie wavelength, λdB, must ﬁt within the
circumference of the hollow ﬁber, it may be quite long. For example, for a = 10µm, then
20π µm. But the low temperatures desired
as determined by de Broglie’s constraint, λdB ≤
may give λdB which would be even longer and therefore can’t ﬁt within the circumference of
the hollow ﬁber and is not allowed. The conclusion is that the minimum eigenvalue depends
on the inner radius of the hollow ﬁber. Larger inner radius ﬁbers sustain lower eigenvalues
(as well as a higher number of states) in the negative energy well and this eﬀect has been
observed in the numerical calculations.

In order to obtain a numerical solution of Schr¨odinger’s eq., it is helpful to write it in

dimensionless form by letting ρ = r/a. The result is the scale factor, SF, given by

U(r) has a large positive barrier at ρ < 1, and, thus, the problem can be

solved by approximating the long-lived resonance problem as a bound state. The bound-
state problem is deﬁned by setting a boundary condition such that the wavefunction vanishes
inside this potential barrier.

The results for the eigenenergy were conﬁrmed using three approaches that determine the
eigenvalue by a trial method using a numerical initial-value problem solver: (i) a shooting
algorithm that starts the solution at ρ = 0 and ensures that the solution vanishes at ρ =
ρ1 without crossing the ρ-axis; (ii) the same algorithm which starts the solution at ρ =
ρ1, and which propagates the solution inwards; (iii) a matching algorithm which combines

information from both inside-out and outside-in integrations, and which is deemed to be
numerically more stable. Condition (iii) is shown below as:

The sensitivity of the eigenvalue to the choice of the right-hand boundary ρ1 where the
boundary condition was set to ψ(ρ1) = 0 was explored. A range was found for ρ1 values such
that the eigenvalue remained constant.

The determined ground-state energy eigenvalue was veriﬁed by increasing the numerical
precision. It can be observed from Fig.5 that the potential well is quite narrow, and that the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle prevents the atoms from accumulating near the classical
potential energy minimum. For this potential, the atoms are bound with an energy that
corresponds to about one quarter of the value of the potential at the minimum, and the
atoms spend a considerable amount of time inside the potential barrier. The results are
10−31 J.

An interesting feature of this trap is the increased atom density that results from the
compression of the atoms in the original volume to the much smaller volume of the annular
shell. Consider the following simple model for atom compression. A hollow ﬁber of unit
1
length is initially ﬁlled at some pressure which is proportional to
πa2 . These atoms are
compressed and the new pressure is inversely proportional to the area of the annulus. This

can be written as

where r2 and r1 are the outer and inner radius of the annulus,

1

π(r2 + r1)(r2

respectively. Writing this as

1
π(2rave)(δr)
r1)
where rave can be approximated by the location of the minimum in the potential and δr is
the width of the annulus. Since the minimum in the potential occurs about 0.15µm from the
a. The distance between the classical turning points is a good estimate
inner wall, rave ≈
1.5 times this value would account for
for δr but this would be a low estimate whereas
tunneling which occurs mostly on the inside. The compression factor, C, becomes

where in this simple model, the compression is assumed to be lossless. As an example,
consider a hollow ﬁber where a = 10−2 m and δr = 10−7 m. This gives C = 3.33
104 which
considering likely losses still seems quite signiﬁcant.

The characterization of this trap particularly as it involves the details of evaporative
cooling is important for several applications such as the limiting temperature that can be
achieved and whether BEC might be easily achieved in this trap. An introduction to these
issues is discussed by Metcalf [13], but these are beyond the scope of the present paper[14].
Also, it is expected that the negative potential energy well will also exist for a slab geometry

5

and for the “atom trampoline” in which an atom in a gravitational ﬁeld will bounce up and
down on top of the dielectric slab .

Finally, these concepts are applicable to a de Broglie atom trap. Instead of using a hollow
ﬁber, Dowling[15] suggested using a bottle to trap the atoms. The bottle has a narrow neck
and a short bundle of narrow, hollow optical ﬁbers are arranged side by side and fused to
form a porous plug for sealing the neck of the bottle trap. Blue detuned light can then be
coupled from the walls of the bottle via contact coupling into the non-hollow parts of the
plug in such a way that very little scattered light will exist in the hollow regions of the plug
and the plug can eﬀectively repel cold atoms which would otherwise come in contact with it.
Relatively warm atoms, having short de Broglie wavelengths, can then be injected directly
through the small open areas of the ﬁber plug directly in to the bottle where the atoms are
subsequently cooled using laser cooling with ﬁber couplers followed by evaporative cooling
as has been described. By cooling the atoms inside the bottle, the de Broglie wavelength
will increase to the point where the atoms will be unable to pass through the small diameter
hollow ﬁbers in the porous plug and will now be trapped for considerable times inside the
bottle to form an atom bottle trap. The atom bottle geometry has the additional beneﬁt
that even lower temperatures can be achieved together with higher compression factors by
going to a larger inner diameter of the bottle as compared to the hollow ﬁber.

Fig.1. The combined eﬀect of the repulsive barrier and vdW potential are shown here. The
barrier is repulsive in the sense that atoms moving toward the inner wall will be repelled back
toward the origin for energies less than the barrier height. For those atoms either tunneling
through the barrier or otherwise getting very close to the inner wall, the strongly attractive
van der Waals force dominates here as it tends to
and the atoms will be strongly drawn
toward the inner wall and will quickly hit it.

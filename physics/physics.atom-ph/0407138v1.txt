1. Introduction

Ultracold neutral plasmas [1], formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near the
ionization threshold, stretch the boundaries of traditional neutral plasma physics. The
electron temperature in these plasmas is from 1-1000K and the ion temperature is around
1 K. The density can be as high as 1010 cm−3. Fundamental interest in these systems
stems from the possibility of creating strongly-coupled plasmas [2], but collective modes
[3], recombination [4], and thermalization [5] have also been studied.

Charged particle detection techniques have traditionally been used for these
experiments. However, optical absorption imaging and spectroscopy, demonstrated
2P1/2 transition in a strontium plasma, opens many new
[5] using the Sr+ 2S1/2 →
possibilities. Images depict the density proﬁle of the plasma, and the Doppler-broadened
absorption spectrum measures the ion velocity distribution. Both can probe ion
dynamics with 50 ns resolution.

Qualitative interpretation of the images and spectrum is straightforward, but
quantitative analysis is complicated by the inhomogeneous density distribution of the
plasma, plasma expansion, and the possible lack of global thermal equilibrium for the
ions. In order to address these eﬀects, we are forced to make some simple assumptions
about the form of the ion temperature distribution and expansion of the plasma. In
this article we motivate these assumptions and describe our methods for quantitatively
analyzing the data.

Section 2 provides an overview of the plasma creation and absorption imaging
technique. Section 3 describes the dynamics of the ions during the ﬁrst few microseconds
after photoionization. This provides the basis for understanding Sec. 4, which explains
how the absorption spectrum is extracted from the images and how it relates to the
temperature distribution.

2. Experimental Overview

The production of a strontium plasma starts with atoms that are cooled and conﬁned
in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) (Figs. 1 and 2). This aspect of the experiment was
described in [6]. The neutral atom cloud is characterized by a temperature of a few
mK and a density distribution given by n(r) = n0exp(

can be adjusted. In particular, turning oﬀ the trap and allowing the cloud to expand
yields larger samples with lower densities.

To form the plasma, the MOT magnets are turned oﬀ and atoms are ionized with
photons from the cooling laser and from a 10 ns pulsed dye laser whose wavelength
is tuned just above the ionization continuum (Fig. 1). Up to 30% of the neutral
atoms are ionized, producing plasmas with a peak electron and ion density as high

ions decay to the 2D3/2 state 7% of the time, after which they cease to interact with
the imaging beam. This does not complicate the experiment because ions typically

Figure 2. From [5]. Experimental schematic for strontium plasma experiments. The
MOT for neutral atoms consists of a pair of anti-Helmholtz magnetic coils and 6 laser-
cooling beams. Atoms from a Zeeman-slowed atomic beam enter the MOT region and
are trapped. 1P1 atoms are ionized by the photoionizing laser. The imaging beam
passes through the plasma and falls on a CCD camera.

Because of the small electron-ion mass ratio, the electrons have an initial kinetic
energy approximately equal to the diﬀerence between the photon energy and the
ionization potential, typically between 1 and 1000 K. The initial kinetic energy for the
ions is close to the kinetic energy of neutral atoms in the MOT. As we will discuss below,
the resulting non-equilibrium plasma evolves rapidly.

To record an absorption image of the plasma, a collimated laser beam, tuned near
resonance with the principle transition in the ions, illuminates the plasma and falls on
an image intensiﬁed CCD camera. The ions scatter photons out of the laser beam and
create a shadow that is recorded by an intensiﬁed CCD camera. The optical depth
(OD) is deﬁned in terms of the image intensity without (Ibackground) and with (Iplasma)

Figure 3 shows a typical absorption image. Section 4 describes how detailed information
about the plasma is extracted from the optical depth.

3. Ion Dynamics

In order to understand the details of the image analysis, it is necessary to understand
the dynamics of the plasma. The imaging probe is most sensitive to the ion dynamics, so
we will concentrate on this topic. The behavior of electrons was studied experimentally
in [1, 3, 4] and theoretically in [7, 8, 9].

Ions are created with very little kinetic energy, but their initial spatially
uncorrelated state possesses signiﬁcant Coulomb potential energy compared to the
regular lattice that represents the ground state of the system [10, 11]. As ions equilibrate
and correlations develop, the kinetic energy increases. This process is called disorder-
induced heating, or correlation heating, and it has been discussed in many theoretical
papers. Early interest was generated by non-equilibrium plasmas created by fast-pulse
laser irradiation of solid targets, for example [12, 13, 14, 15], and the problem has been
revisited in the context of ultracold neutral plasmas [7, 8, 16, 17].

Qualitatively, one expects the ion temperature after equilibration to be on the order
of the Coulomb interaction energy between neighboring ions. A quantitative analysis

Physically, this is the time for an ion to move about an interparticle spacing when
accelerated by a typical Coulomb force of e2/4πε0a2. This time scale is also evident in
molecular dynamics simulations of ion-ion thermalization [7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
It is interesting to note that under usual conditions in weakly interacting plasmas or
even atomic gases, the time scale for relaxation of the two-particle distribution function,
which describes correlations, is much faster than the collision time that governs the
relaxation of the one-particle distribution function to the Maxwell-Boltzmann form.
This is known as Bogoliubov’s hypothesis [20]. For strongly-coupled plasmas, however,
these time scales both become equal to the inverse of the plasma oscillation frequency
[13].

q

As the two-particle distribution function equilibrates, the kinetic energy of the
ions exhibits strongly damped oscillations at twice the ion plasma oscillation frequency.
Intuitively, this can be understood as the oscillation of each ion in its local potential
energy well. It is questionable whether this should be called an ion plasma oscillation or
not because there is probably no collective or long range coherence to the motion. This
behavior has been observed in molecular dynamics simulations of equilibrating strongly-
coupled systems [13, 15, 17]. The damping time for the oscillations is approximately
π/ωpi for Γ

described here, obscures the oscillations. A diﬀerent approach, which resolves regions of

diﬀerent density in the plasma, is required to clearly observe the oscillations, and this
phenomenon will not be discussed further in this paper.

For tdelay > π/ωpi, the ions have equilibrated and the thermal energy of the
electrons begins to dominate the evolution of the plasma. Electrons contained in the
potential created by the ions exert a pressure on the ions that causes an outward radial
acceleration. This was studied experimentally in [3] and theoretically by a variety of
means in [9]. The experiments measured the ﬁnal velocity that the ions acquired, which

As discussed in [3] and [5], a hydrodynamic model, which describes the plasma
on length scales larger than λD, shows that the pressure of the electron gas drives the

The velocity is correlated with position and increases linearly with time. This does not
represent an increase in the random thermal velocity spread or temperature of the ions.
Due to the large mass diﬀerence, thermalization of ions and electrons [7] is slow and
occurs on a millisecond time scale.

Equation 4 for the average ion velocity assumes a constant electron temperature.
Actually, as the plasma expands, electrons will cool. This can be thought of in
terms of energy conservation or adiabatic expansion.
It is possible to describe the
expansion with a Vlasov equation that includes the changing electron temperature.
For an initial Gaussian density distribution, the equations can be solved analytically
and the expansion preserves the Gaussian shape with a 1/√e density radius given by
i (0)+[kBTe(0)/mi]t2 [9, 21, 22]. The experiments involving absorption imaging

of the plasma, however, have concentrated on the ﬁrst few microseconds of the expansion
when the plasma size and electron temperature have not changed signiﬁcantly. Thus we
can safely use Eq. 4. The eﬀects of the expansion are evident in the radial velocity that
manifests itself in Doppler broadening of the ion absorption spectrum.

4. Doppler-Broadened Spectrum

To obtain quantitative information from the plasma images, we relate the OD (Eq. 1) to
underlying physical parameters. Following Beer’s law, the OD for a laser propagating

due to Doppler broadening, and since we expect the temperature to vary with density,
we allow α to vary with position. If we now integrate over x and y, or, in reality, sum
over the image pixels multiplied by the pixel area, we get the spectrum

accounts for the equal distribution of ions in the doubly degenerate ground state and
the linear polarization of the imaging light [23].

Extracting the ion temperature from the spectrum is complicated by the fact
that we do not expect to have global thermal equilibrium of the ions during the
ﬁrst microsecond after plasma formation. Global thermal equilibrium will occur on
a hydrodynamic time scale, σi/v, which is on the order of ten microseconds, where v is
the ion acoustic wave velocity

.

We need a method to relate the Doppler broadening of the spectrum to a
characteristic temperature. We will show that for reasonable models of the ion
temperature distribution, the temperature extracted from a ﬁt of a Voigt proﬁle to
the spectrum yields a temperature that is a close approximation of the average ion
temperature in the plasma. More thorough checks of this assignment, such as with
molecular dynamics simulations, would be valuable, but this serves as a useful working
deﬁnition for discussing the data.

For times longer than π/ωpi, but short compared to hydrodynamic times, we expect
local thermal equilibrium at a temperature approximately given by Eq. 2. Under this
model, the temperature varies across the plasma because the interparticle spacing, a,
varies with density. Given Te and ni, it is possible to use Eq. 2 in an iterative recipe
to ﬁnd the local ion temperature. This procedure utilizes an expression [24] for the
excess potential energy ˜U in terms of Γi and κ that is valid for κ < 5. This yields ion
temperature distributions as shown in Fig. 5.

To simplify the discussion, we ﬁrst neglect electron screening. This accurately

If we want to include the eﬀects of electron screening, we can follow exactly the
same procedure, except in our model of the spectrum (Eq. 10) we use the iterative
recipe for ion temperature using Eq. 2, instead of the simple Eq. 8. This slightly
more complicated numerical analysis shows that if Eq. 2 describes the temperature
distribution, then the temperature extracted from the Voigt proﬁle is betwen 0.91 and
0.95 of Ti,ave. In this case, the average ion temperature is found by averaging Eq. 2 over
the density distribution.

Figure 6. Assuming Ti(r) is given by Eq. 8, the Doppler proﬁle averaged over
the density distribution can be replaced by a Doppler proﬁle characterized by a
single uniform temperature, T = 0.59 Ti,max = 0.91 Ti,ave. The statistical weight
is proportional to the probability of ﬁnding ions with that Doppler shift, and the
horizontal axis is the Doppler shift in units of σD,max.

If we have global thermal equilibrium, which we expect for long tdelay, then the
temperature is uniform, and, by deﬁnition, the Voigt proﬁle will yield the average
temperature.

The expansion of the plasma, Eq. 4, also contributes to the velocity distribution. So
we must expand our model. Fortunately, the expansion is well understood [3, 9, 22] and
determined by the parameters Te and σi. Independent analysis of the images determines
σi. Te is approximately equal to 2Ee/3kB, where Ee is the detuning of the photoionizing
laser above resonance [1], although for high density and low electron temperature, we
can expect a small increase of Te above 2Ee/3kB due to electron heating from three-body
recombination [9], disorder-induced heating [7], and continuum lowering [8].

We will ﬁrst treat the expansion using the simple model of ion temperature, Eq.
8. The expansion velocity proﬁle gives rise to an average Doppler shift of the resonant
frequency that varies with position,

where rcosθ is the displacement from the center of the cloud along the direction of laser

which is the time at which the Doppler shift due to expansion, at rcosθ = σi, equals
σD,ave. In other words, this is the time at which the Doppler broadening due to expansion
becomes comparable to the thermal Doppler broadening. For typical plasma conditions,
such as Te = 30 K, Ti,ave = 1 K, and σi = 1 mm, Eq. 14 yields texp = 3.4 µs.

shown analytically that T = Ti,ave[1 + (tdelay/texp)2] exactly. This suggests that when

the extracted eﬀective temperature can be related to the average temperature in the

in the limit when all broadening is negligible except the Doppler broadening due to
expansion.

Our motivation of Eq. 16 relies on certain models of the ion temperature. They are
reasonable approximations to the distributions seen in molecular dynamics simulations
except at short times, t < π/ωpi ≈
500 ns, during the initial rapid disorder-induced
heating and oscillatory phase when the kinetic energy distribution as a function of
temperature is not well known. Because this time scale varies with density, we
expect diﬀerent regions to equilibrate and oscillate at diﬀerent times. Extracted ion
temperatures should be viewed as more qualitative for these early times.

Equation 16 is the central result of this paper. It enables us to analyze the data
It also separates the various

contributions to the Doppler broadening of the spectrum. For example, Fig. 8A shows
the time dependence of Ti,ef f for a typical plasma. Figure 8B shows the extracted
Ti,ave with the expansion eﬀects removed. The only ﬁt parameter in the model line
in Fig. 8A is Ti,ave. This procedure allows us to determine Ti,ave to an accuracy of
about 0.2 K. Alternatively, after removing the eﬀect of expansion by scaling the data by
0.95 [1 + (1/0.95)(tdelay/texp)2], as in 8B, the equilibration temperature can be identiﬁed
by the plateau. Scaling the data also improves the visibility of the disorder-induced
heating during the ﬁrst 1/ωpi ≈
180 ns. When there is signiﬁcant electron heating
[7, 9, 8], Te will exceed 3Ee/2kB, and Te then becomes a ﬁt parameter that provides
information on the electron dynamics.

Using this recipe for analyzing the data we can conduct quantitative studies of the
rate and equilibration temperature for disorder-induced heating. We can also examine
the factors aﬀecting ion temperature oscillations, electron temperature, and plasma
expansion. These will be the subjects of future work.

The quantum electrodynamic theory of the nuclear recoil eﬀect on the atomic g factor to all
orders in αZ and to ﬁrst order in m/M is formulated. The complete αZ-dependence formula for
the recoil correction to the bound-electron g factor in a hydrogenlike atom is derived. This formula
is used to calculate the recoil correction to the bound-electron g factor in the order (αZ)
m/M for
an arbitrary state of a hydrogenlike atom.

I. INTRODUCTION

High precision direct measurements of the bound-electron g factor in low-Z hydrogenlike ions, which are performed
by a GSI - Universit¨at Mainz collaboration [1,2], have triggered a great interest to the calculations of QED and nuclear
corrections to this eﬀect [3–12]. It is expected that in nearest future the collaboration will extend these measurements
to high-Z systems. The accurate measurements of the g factor in heavy ions would provide a good possibility for a
test of the magnetic sector of QED in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld. To date, investigations of the bound-electron g factor in
heavy ions were performed only by an indirect method [13] which is based on using the fact that the bound-electron
g factor can be expressed in terms of the transition probability between the hyperﬁne splitting components [14,15].
In particular, in the case of hydrogenlike bismuth, it was found that including the QED correction to the g factor is
necessary to obtain agreement between theory and experiment (see [15,16] for details). However, the indirect method
can not provide so high accuracy as the direct method if the latter is extended to high-Z systems.

It is known (see, e.g., [16,17]) that calculations of heavy ions have to be performed without any expansion in the
papameter αZ. In particular, it means that, to zeroth-order approximation, the electron in a hydrogenlike atom must
be described by the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential induced by the nucleus. For the point-charge nucleus,
the bound-electron g factor in a hydrogenlike atom is easily calculated analytically (see, e.g., [18]). The one-loop
QED corrections to the 1s g factor were calculated to all orders in αZ in [3–6] (see also [7]). The ﬁnite nuclear size
correction can be found by solving the Dirac equation for an extended nucleus [4,13]. For low- and middle-Z atoms,
this correction can also be found by non-relativistic and approximate relativistic formulas [8,19]. The nuclear recoil
correction to the 1s g factor was evaluated only to the lowest order in αZ [20–23] (see also [24,12]). The methods
developed in [20–23] are suitable for calculations to a few lowest orders in the parameter αZ and are not intended
for calculations of the recoil eﬀect to all orders in αZ. Therefore, ﬁrst of all we need to develop a new method which
would provide a systematic treatment of the recoil eﬀect on the g factor to all orders in αZ and to ﬁrst order in
m/M (m is the electron mass and M is the nucleus mass). Such a method is proposed in the present paper. This
method is valid for the general case of a many-electron atom. Apllieng the method to a hydrogenlike atom, the
complete αZ-dependence formula for the recoil correction to the g factor is derived. To the lowest relativistic order
(αZ)2m/M ), this formula is used to calculate analytically the recoil correction to the g factor in the case of an
(
∼
arbitrary state of a hydrogenlike atom. For the 1s state, the result obtained in this paper coincides with the related
result obtained previously in [20–23].

The relativistic units (¯h = c = 1) and the Heaviside charge unit (α = e2/(4π), e < 0) are used in the paper.

II. QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS TO FIRST ORDER IN m/M BEYOND THE FURRY
PICTURE

To derive the Hamiltonian of the atom to ﬁrst order in m/M and to lowest order in α (but to all orders in αZ),
we start with the relativistic quantum mechanical treatment of the electrons and the non-relativistic treatment of the
nucleus. For simplicity, we consider the nucleus as a spinless particle. The electrons and the nucleus interact with each
other, with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, and with the classical homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, Acl(r) = [
r]/2.
In the Coulomb gauge and the Schr¨odinger representation, the Hamiltonian of the system to ﬁrst order in the
interaction with Acl(r) is

where N ′ is the total number of the positive and negative energy state electrons, p(e)
and p(n) are the electron and
i
nucleus momentum operators, respectively, V (r(e)
r(n)) is the operator of the electron-nucleus Coulomb interaction,
∂A/∂t. The last two
A(r) is the vector potential of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld,
A, and
terms in equation (1) describe the interaction of the electrons and the nucleus with the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld.
We introduce the center-of-mass variables for the electron-nucleus subsystem

Here we have disregarded the terms of second and higher orders in m/M . Because the second term in the right hand
side of equation (14) contains the factor e m
M , to ﬁrst order in m/M , it can contribute only to ﬁrst and higher orders
in α. Therefore, to the order under consideration (to zeroth order in α, to ﬁrst order in m/M , and to all orders in

Here ψ(x) and φ(x) are the electron and nucleus ﬁeld operators in the Schr¨odinger representation and ∆x is the
Laplace operator. The scalar product is implicit in equations (23)-(34). It should be stressed that, despite the nuclear
ﬁeld operator φ(x) is introduced, the Hamiltonian (20) has physical sense only in the one nuclear particle sector. The
introduction of φ(x) will simplify the use of the standard QED methods for calculations by perturbation theory.

The calculations of the atomic energy levels, based on the Hamiltonian (20), can be performed by perturbation
theory. It is convenient to consider that in zeroth approximation the Hamiltonian of the system is given by the term
H0. The terms H (1)
int are accounted for by perturbation theory. As usual (see, e.g., [25,26]), the vacuum state is
deﬁned as a state in which the negative-energy continuum is occupied by electrons and the electron current operator
eψ(x)γµψ(x) must be replaced by (e/2)[ψ(x)γµ, ψ(x)] in all the equations given above.

III. GENERAL FORMULAS FOR THE ENERGY SHIFTS

First, we formulate a procedure for deriving the energy shift due to the terms H (1)

int . The operator H ′ deﬁned
by equation (36) commutes with the total momentum of the system (35) and, therefore, the atom can be characterized
by a ﬁxed momentum K. We are interested in the energy shift, ∆E(a,K) = E(a,K) −
(a,K), of a single isolated level
of an N -electron atom. Here N denotes the number of the atomic (positive-energy-state) electrons, K is the

total momentum of the system described by the Hamiltonian H ′, and a denotes the set of the other quantum numbers.
In zeroth approximation, the energy E(0)

function. The ga(E, K) function contains the complete information about the energy levels of the system described
by H ′. Deﬁned by equation (44) for real E, it can be continued analytically to the complex E plane with some cuts
(see, e.g., [27,28]). From the spectral representation of ga(E, K), we obtain

the transition in (51) to the interaction representation. Since we are interested in the energy shifts in the atom rest

IV. RELATIVISTIC FORMULA FOR THE RECOIL CORRECTION TO THE
BOUND-ELECTRON g FACTOR IN A HYDROGENLIKE ATOM

The method formulated in the previous sections can be used to derive the complete αZ-dependence expressions for
the recoil corrections to the energy levels (Acl(x) = 0) and to the atomic g factor to ﬁrst order in m/M . The relevant
expression for the recoil correction to the energy levels in a hydrogenlike atom was ﬁrst derived by a quasipotential
method in [30] and was subsequently rederived by other methods in [31–33] (a part of the expression was previously
found in [34]). In this section, we derive the corresponding formula for the recoil correction to the bound-electron g
factor in a hydrogenlike atom.

In what follows, we will consider that V (x) in the Dirac equation (42) is the potential of an extended-charge nucleus.
This will allow us to avoid a special treatment of the degenerate states of diﬀerent parity (such as 2s and 2p1/2) in the
derivation of the contributions from the ∆H ′ term. However, as it will be seen from the ﬁnal formulas obtained below,
they have neither singularities nor ambiguities when V (x)
and, therefore, the pure Coulomb
potential can be used in these formulas as well.

We are interested in the energy shifts of ﬁrst order in the magnetic ﬁeld and of ﬁrst order in m/M . The contributions
of interest arise in a few lowest orders of the perturbation theory. They can be conventionally represented by the
following combinations:

As to the terms H (12)
int , in the order under consideration, the ﬁrst of these terms gives a contribution which
is independent of the internal atomic quantum numbers while the second one gives zero when it is averaged with the
electron wave function of a deﬁnite parity. Therefore, the both terms can be omitted.

int and H (13)

To calculate ∆E(1), it is convenient to consider that H (9)
int is included in the unperturbed Hamiltonian. This means
that the interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld, δV (x) =
Acl(x), must be included in the Dirac equation (42).
eα
Then the derivation of the formula for this correction reduces to the related derivation of the recoil correction to the
energy levels for Acl(x) = 0 [30–33]. It follows that to obtain ∆E(1), we may simply replace V (x) by V (x) + δV (x)
everywhere in the formula for the recoil correction to the energy level and decompose it to ﬁrst order in δV (x).
However, before to do that, let us demonstrate how the recoil correction to the energy level can be derived within the
formalism considered here.

The total energy shift of ﬁrst order in m/M and of ﬁrst order in the interaction with the classical magnetic ﬁeld is
∆E(tot) = ∆E(1) +∆E(2). In the compact form, ∆E(1) and ∆E(2) are deﬁned by equations (73) and (92), respectively.
For practical calculations, it is more convenient to use the representation given by equations (76)-(78) and (93)-(95).
To derive these equations, we have assumed that V (x) deviates from the pure Coulomb potential. However, since the
ﬁnal formulas for the energy shift exhibit neither singularities nor ambiguities when V (x)

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper we formulated the systematic QED method for calculations of the nuclear recoil corrections to the
energy levels and to the electronic g factor in atoms to ﬁrst order in m/M and to all orders in αZ. Employing this
method, we derived the complete αZ-dependence expression for the recoil correction to the bound-electron g factor
in a hydrogenlike atom (equations (73),92)). This expression was also represented as the sum of the lower-order and
higher-order terms (equations (76)-(78), (93)-(95)). The lower-order term contains all the non-relativistic and lowest-
order relativistic contributions and a part of the higher-order corrections. For an arbitrary state of a hydrogenlike
atom, a simple analytical formula was derived for this term (equation (113)). As to the higher-order term, we expect
that its numerical evaluation can be performed in the same way as the evaluation of the related contribution to the
energy levels [38–40]. This calculation, which is equally important for low- and high-Z systems, is under way and will
be published elsewhere.

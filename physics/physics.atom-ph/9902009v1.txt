1 Introduction

Many-electron ionization of atoms by laser ﬁeld was ﬁrs observed by Suran and Zape-

sochny [1] in alkali-earth atoms (the review of that work as well as some earlier ones

see in [2]). At present, such studies form one of main guidelines in physics of strong

ﬁeld interaction with atoms [3].

A number of theoretical models were proposed for interpretation of the gathered

experimental data. Some models dealt with direct inﬂuence of laser radiation on the

atomic electrons [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the others consider highly-stripped ion formation due

to nonelastic scattering of previously emitted electrons with the parent ion [9, 10, 11].

These models allow to explain a number of observed features of the phenomenon [12, 13,

14, 15, 16]. Nevertheless, there are some diﬃculties in theoretical description of highly-

stripped ion formation in laser ﬁeld which is not related to nonelastic collisions [4, 5,

6, 7, 8]. Due to these diﬃculties, the above mechanisms cannot be properly used for

explanation of the experiment.

At the same time, it is well-known fact that the single-charged ion formation by

a laser ﬁeld in tunnelling regime can be satisfactory described in terms of relatively

simple formulae of the ADK theory [17, 18, 19]. An empirical generalization of the

ADK formulae for describing the highly-stripped ion formation was proposed in [20].

So it would be reasonable to generalize the available theory of tunnelling in atoms to

the case of non-sequentional multiple ionization of atom. Solution of this problem is

the objective of the present work.

Obviously, the Josephson eﬀect can be considered as a solid-state analogue of the

considered phenomenon. Some considerations on diﬀerence between the one- and

many-particle tunnelling are mentioned in reference [21]. Comparison of these con-

siderations with the results of the present work shows that the mentioned diﬀerence

for tunnelling in atoms is not so trivial as it was described in [21].

2 Asymptotics of the many-electron wave function

Let us remembers some facts which make the main proposed concepts easer to un-

derstand. To describe optical transitions in complex atoms, Bates and Damgaard [22]

modiﬁed the Slater method [23]. Basically, the nodeless character of Slater orbitals

was retained. Unlike the Slater method, the eﬀective nuclear charge ceases to be a

ﬁtting parameter for valence electrons in atom since it coincide with the residual ion

charge. But the eﬀective principal quantum number is uniquely determined by the

electron coupling energy. So the asymptotical region of electron motion is considered,

where the atomic potential has Coulomb shape. High accuracy of oscillator strengths

2

calculations [24] using the Bates–Damgaard method and its clear physical justiﬁcation

allows to use this method in calculations of other atomic characteristics determined by

large electron-nucleus distances.

The tunnelling probability is also determined by large electron-nucleus distances

where the energy of the electron interaction with the external ﬁeld becomes compa-

rable with the attractive energy of the residual ion. So the Bates–Damgaard method

can be used for describing the tunnelling eﬀect. Such a procedure was developed in

recent work [25] for tunnelling calculation in Rydberg molecules. In that work some

evaluations are presented for the applicability conditions of the method.

Let N equivalent (i. e. belonging to the same atomic shell) electrons are removed

from the atom via tunnelling. Then the asymptotic behaviour of the radial part of

N-electron wavefunction in the Bates–Damgaard approximation is determined by the

product of properly symmetrized one-electron function asymptotics:

Here b = aν/Z, Z is the residual ion charge, a = ~2/µe2 is Bohr radius, µ, e are the
mass of electron and the absolute value of its charge, ε = (l + 1
2)/ν. The Cνl constant
ν,
in (1) is determined in quasiclassical approximation not implying the condition l

at ε

which was required in [19]. It results in the arising of L(ε) function with L(ε)

0. After passage to this limit the expression (1) for the Cνl constant turns
into the formula (11) of the reference [19] (with an inaccuracy corrected: the number

The expression (1) for Cνl is obtained under ε < 1. For ε > 1, the quasiclassical
approximation is not valid, so calculation of Cνl requires numerical approaches (see,
e. g., [26]).

The principal quantum number ν is determined by the electron coupling energy.
Denoting the ﬁrst, second etc. ionization potentials of the atom as E1/e, E2/e . . ., the
principal quantum number of j-th removed electron is

is the coupling energy of N electrons. Note that in framework of the considered model,
the asymptotic behaviour of the bound electron wave function (1) depends on the
number of the removed electrons. So a partial account is provided for many-electron

eﬀects in the initial state.

Now we consider N-electron ionization as removal of a N-electron “bundle” – a

peculiar kind of quasiparticle of mass Nµ and of charge

Ne. In the region which

determines the ionization process, we consider the distances between the electrons in

−

the bundle to be much less than the separation between the atomic core and the center
of bundle mass. Denoting the distance between the i-th and j-th electrons as xij, and
the position of the center of bundle mass as R, we write the corresponding inequality:

xij ≪
Since the atom–laser radiation interaction is considered in dipole approximation, the

inﬂuence of the ﬁeld on N individual electrons is completely equivalent to the inﬂuence
Ne which is located at the point R. As for
the interaction of this quasiparticle with the core Coulomb ﬁeld, the correspondent

of the ﬁeld on a quasiparticle of charge

−

error value is

(xij/R)2, which is small due to the accepted inequality (3).
For the mathematical description of the considered model, one should solve a prob-

problem is to construct the quasiparticle wave function Ψ(N )

This formula determines the N-electron tunnelling probability in dc ﬁeld within a factor

accounting for the overlapping of wave functions of the electrons remaining in the atom,

6

with the wavefunctions of the same electrons in the initial state. Obviously, this factor

cannot exceed 1, and its more accurate evaluation can be performed only numerically.

Note that the N multiplier in the exponent in (14) in now ways gives an exhaustive

account for the dependence of this exponent on N, as it was considered in [21]. Due

to the formulae (2), (10), this dependence is signiﬁcantly more complicated and it is

determined by the spectrum of the particular atom. We present below (ﬁgure 1) a

numerical example illustrating this statement.

Now we consider that

Since the coupling energy is increasing for each subsequent electron, N-electron tun-

4 Numerical examples

Unfortunately, the obtained formulae cannot be immediately related to an experiment,

because, along with the direct N-fold ions formation, there are a number of cascade

processes as well as other ionization mechanisms due to nonelastic collisions of electrons

and ions [9, 10, 11]. For the relation of the theory with an experiment, the correspon-

dent kinetic equations are to be solved, that should be a subject for another work. So

only some illustrative examples are considered in this section.

the noble gases resulted from two 2-cascade processes: A

The ﬁgure 1 presents the relation of probabilities of 3-fold ions formation in
A3+ and
A3+. These probabilities are denoted as W (1; 2) and W (2; 1) corre-
spondingly. They have similar dependence on the laser pulse duration. As it is seen,

A

the relation W (1; 2)/W (2; 1) is not equal to 1, as it is follows from the results of refer-

ence [21].

The following result seems to be curious. The 2-electron tunnelling probabili-

ties for neutral atoms can be greater than the one-electron tunnelling probabilities

in correspondent singly charged ions. E. g., for Ar atom the 2-electron tunnelling
probability exceeds the 1-electron process probability for Ar+ ion at the intensi-
ties I > 1014.88 W/cm2. The same result takes place for Kr at I > 1014.76 W/cm2,
for Xe at I > 1014.34 W/cm2. At the same time, for light noble gases atoms He and Ne,
the probabilities of one-electron tunnelling in singly charged ions are approximately

by two orders greater than the probabilities of two-electron process in the correspon-
1015 W/cm2. These facts shows wide range of experimental

dent neutral atoms at I

≃
situations arising in multiphoton tunnelling eﬀect.

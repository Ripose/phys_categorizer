Abstract

The threshold law for N−body fragmentation under dipole forces is formu-
lated. It emerges from the energy dependence of the normalization of the cor-
related continuum wave function for N fragments. It is shown that the dipole
threshold law plays a key role in understanding all threshold fragmentation
phenomena since it links the classical threshold law for long-range Coulomb
interactions to the statistical law for short-range interactions. Furthermore,
a tunnelling mechanism is identiﬁed as the common feature which occurs for
all three classes of interactions, short-range, dipole and Coulomb.

In 1949 Wigner derived a threshold law for the break-up of two quantum particles under
short-range and long-range (Coulomb) forces [1]. Using exclusively classical mechanics Wan-
nier formulated in 1953 a threshold law for the break-up of a two-electron atom into three
charged particles [2]. Corresponding threshold laws for four charged fragments have been
published in the meantime [3]. More than 15 years after Wigner’s paper O’Malley provided
the two-body threshold law for dipole interactions [4] through the analysis of the normaliza-
tion constant of the continuum ﬁnal state wavefunction in a similar way as Wigner obtained
his threshold laws. Wigner’s as well as Wannier’s threshold law have been conﬁrmed by a
number of experiments [5]. This is also true for the statistical threshold law for break-up
into multiple fragments under short-range forces: Derived from simply counting the avail-
able states of free motion in the continuum at the respective energy it has been used to
successfully interprete experimental results and it has been shown to be compatible with
Wigner’s law for short-range forces [6].

Summarizing the situation one can say that three types of threshold laws, Wigner’s,
Wannier’s and the statistical one, have been derived by diﬀerent means for diﬀerent situa-
tions. Here, we will show that a connection between these threshold laws exists: It is the
threshold law for N-body break-up under dipole forces. We will derive it in the following by
generalizing O’Malley’s two-body approach to an arbitrary number of particles. This allows
us to formulate the threshold law for N−body break-up under dipole interactions. Moreover,
for short-range interactions the statistical law is directly recovered from the general dipole
threshold law. Finally, we discuss a semiclassical tunnelling interpretation which provides
insight into the mechanism of threshold fragmentation on the one hand side and clariﬁes the
connection with the (semi-)classical threshold law for long-range Coulomb forces.

Our starting point is the N-particle Schr¨odinger equation in hyperspherical coordinates
i )1/2. The ~ri are mass scaled Jacobi
(r, ~ω), where r represents the hyperradius r = (Pi ~r2
coordinates and the set of angles ~ω denotes the usual geometric directions of the ~ri in
conﬁguration space as well as the so called hyperangles which describe the relative lengths
ri = |~ri|, e.g., tan ω1 = r1/r2 [7]. Writing the total wavefunction as

ψ(r, ~ω) = r(D−1)/2Ψ(r, ~ω)

with D = 3N − 3, we obtain the Schr¨odinger equation

where the energy has been expressed through the wavenumber k = (2mE)1/2/¯h. The Jaco-
bian factor JD = 1
4(D − 1)(D − 3) is a consequence of the transformation Eq. (1) and Λ2
is the Laplace operator on the D-dimensional unit sphere [7]. In Eq. (2) we have split the
potential into the long-range part VLR(r, ~ω) = 2C(~ω)/r2 and the short-range part deﬁned
by the property

k−2VSR(r/k, ~ω) = 0

lim
k→0

for all ﬁnite r. Since we are interested in the threshold region k → 0 we can scale r = R/k
and divide Eq. (2) by k2.
In the limit k → 0 the short-range potential vanishes due to

2

Eq. (3). Hence, the angular problem in ~ω becomes independent of r and the wavefunction

can be written as Ψ(R, ~ω) = Pj uj(R)Φj(~ω), where Φj is an eigenfunction of

(Λ2 + 2C(~ω) − λj)Φj(~ω) = 0

(4)

with eigenvalue λj. The remaining radial problem represents the diﬀerential equation for
a Bessel function if we insert the eigenvalue λj (for reasons of clarity we continue using
unscaled coordinates):

for νj > 0. If (D − 2)2 < −4λj then νj = i¯νj becomes imaginary. In this case the dipole
potential is so attractive due to the negative value of λj that it overcomes the repulsive
D−dependent part.
With Eq. (5) we have reduced the problem of ﬁnding the threshold behavior of multi-
particle break-up under dipole forces to the corresponding problem for two particles solved
by O’Malley [4]. The only diﬀerence is that the strength of the dipole potential Eq. (7)
depends now on the dimension of the problem, D = (3N-3), i.e. the number of particles N,
and on the dynamics in the other than radial degrees of freedom through the eigenvalue λj.
The solution uj(r) to Eq. (5) is a linear combination of Bessel functions J±νj (kr).

The energy dependence of the threshold cross section can be extracted from the energy

dependence of the normalization constant of uj(r). According to [4] it is given by

σj ∝ k2νj ,
νj > 0
¯σj ∝ [sinh2(¯νjπ/2) + cos2(¯νj ln k + δj)]−1, νj = i¯νj

(8a)
(8b)

From Eq. (8) it is clear that the threshold cross section is dominated by the ‘partial wave’
with the lowest eigenvalue λ0 if ν0 ≥ 0.
In the case of a net attractive dipole-potential
νj = i¯νj the threshold cross section will be a superposition σ ∝ P aj ¯σj where the aj as well
as the δj in Eq. (8b) are determined by the short-range part of the potential and all partial
waves contribute for which the eigenvalue λj is suﬃciently negative to yield an imaginary
νj. For strong enough attractive dipole forces, the threshold cross section will approach a
constant value. However, the latter case will be the exception for many-particle systems
since the repulsive centrifugal barrier (D − 2)2 ∝ N 2 grows much faster with the number N
of particles than the eigenvalue λ0 ∝ N.
The dipole threshold law Eq. (8a) contains also the behavior for short-range forces,
C(~ω) = 0. Then ν0 = 1

2(D − 2) and therefore with D = 3N − 3

σs ∝ k3N −5.

This is exactly the statistical threshold law, derived under the assumption that the frag-
mented particles are completely free and that they occupy a phase space volume SE only
restricted by total energy conservation,

SE = Z K 3N −4δ(E − K 2/2)dKZ~ω

d~ω ∝ k3N −5.

(10)

Here, we have used again hyperspherical coordinates, this time in momentum space where
~k2
i )1/2 and the set of angles ~ω refers to the
the hypermomentum is given by K = (Pi
Jacobi momenta ~ki in the same way as for the coordinates, described above. The statistical
threshold law states that the cross section close to threshold varies according to the available
ﬁnal states in the continuum given by their phase space volume σs ∝ SE with the same energy
dependence as Eq. (9). Of course, Wigner’s law σ ∝ √E for N = 2 is reproduced by Eq. (9).
It seems that the other extreme of interaction, namely charged fragments which exert
mutual forces through the Coulomb potential VLR = 2C(r, ~ω)/r even at very large distances,
is also compatible with the dipole law of Eq. (8a) since Wannier’s threshold law for this case
is again a power law σ ∝ kβ. The exponent for two escaping electrons and the remaining
(charged) core of the atom, e.g., may be expressed in the form [8]

where tan ω = r1/r2, the ratio between the two electron-nucleus distances, ω∗ = π/4 and
C∗ = C(ω∗). However, this similarity is misleading for two reasons. Firstly, Wannier’s law is
purely classical. It contains the stability properties of a single classical orbit (with ~r1 = −~r2,
denoted as ’*’ in Eq. (11)). Secondly, the radial Coulomb potential for this orbit is attractive.
However, the power law Eq. (8a) belongs to an eﬀectively repulsive dipole potential.

On the other hand, the threshold behavior of fragmentation under repulsive Coulomb
forces is an exponential law rather than a power law, e.g. for electron detachment of negative
ions by electron impact [9]. There, as a result of the (semi)-classical tunnelling process under
the repulsive barrier, the dominant energy variation near threshold is given by a Gamow
factor

where Γ is the imaginary tunnelling action,

σ ∝ exp[−2Γ(k)],

Γ ≡ iφ = Z (−p2)1/2dr = Z rt

ri

(−k2 + 2C∗/r)1/2dr.

(12)

(13)

This tunnelling process leads through the energy scaling of the homogeneous Coulomb po-
tential to σ ∝ exp(−a/k).
Nevertheless, the qualitatively diﬀerent threshold laws for repulsive Coulomb and
dipole/short-range interactions may be semiclassically interpreted with the same tunnelling
mechanism Eq. (12). In the dipole case the tunnelling action is given by

(14)

which is logarithmically divergent for k → 0. Hence, despite the exponential form of the
Gamow factor Eq. (12), inserting the action from Eq. (14) leads exactly to the power law
of Eq. (8a). We conclude that for most interactions, the threshold mechanism can be in-
terpreted as a tunnelling process. For two fragments and higher angular momentum, the
tunnelling mechanism has already been proposed by Rau [6]. However, as shown here, it
actually holds for all short-range forces, and for repulsive dipole and Coulomb forces. The
only exception are attractive dipole forces with a relatively complicated threshold behavior
Eq. (8b) and attractive Coulomb forces with the well known, classically derived, power law
behavior. A systematic classiﬁcation of threshold laws according to the nature of the re-
spective interaction is presented in Table I. However, one should keep in mind that within
the enormous size of the parameter space covered by Table I, there are always exceptional
cases [10].

In summary we have provided the threshold law for fragmentation of N particles under
dipole forces. Furthermore, it has been shown that this threshold law links the statistical law
for short-range forces to the corresponding law for long-range repulsive Coulomb forces by a
semiclassical tunnelling mechanism. Overlooking the threshold fragmentation for all types of
interactions (Table I) a relatively simple principle emerges which governs this fragmentation:
the balance between potential and kinetic energy for large interparticle distances, i.e. for
large hyperradius r. The quantum mechanical kinetic energy scales as r−2 and has the
corresponding, dipole-like, long-range characteristics. Hence, for short-range potentials the
kinetic energy dominates the threshold behavior. Indeed, a statistical approach, counting
simply available states of free particles, is suﬃcient to describe this situation, see Eq. (10).
Although the r−2 behavior of the kinetic energy is intrinsically quantum mechanical, the
¯h-dependence of the kinetic energy can be scaled out in the absence of a potential and
the threshold problem can be solved semiclassically by a tunnelling trajectory (Eq. (14)).
The other extreme is the Coulomb potential. With its r−1 range it reaches further than
the kinetic energy. Hence, the threshold behavior is decided by properties of the potential
only (essentially its relative curvature, see Eq. (11)). Finally, the subtle case of a dipole
potential r−2 is left. Here, both parts, kinetic and potential energy, contribute on the same
footing. Consequently, the threshold law for N−body break-up as it has been derived in
Eq. (8) exhibits a complicated behavior. However, since the dipole interaction ‘interpolates’,
roughly speaking, between short-range and Coulomb potentials, understanding its threshold
dynamics allows one to solve the general problem of N− body threshold fragmentation under
arbitrary forces, originally formulated by Wigner for two particles [1].
It is a pleasure to dedicate this article to Martin Gutzwiller. His work on semiclassical
theory has been a great inspiration, even more has he himself been inspiring for all of us
who have been lucky enough to exchange ideas with him.

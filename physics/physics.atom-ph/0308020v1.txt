We have produced ultracold, polar RbCs∗ molecules via photoassociation in a laser-cooled mixture
of Rb and Cs atoms. Using a model of the RbCs∗ molecular interaction which reproduces the
observed rovibrational structure, we infer decay rates in our experiments into deeply bound ground
state RbCs vibrational levels as high as 5×105 s−1 per level. Population in these levels could be
eﬃciently transferred to the vibrational ground state using a stimulated Raman transition, which
would result in large numbers of stable, ultracold polar molecules.

In recent years, a growing interest has developed in
extending the many achievements of atomic cooling and
trapping to molecules, whose complex interactions and
internal structure suggest a vast array of new possibil-
ities. Of particular interest would be the production
of ultracold polar molecules, which interact with each
other via electric dipole-dipole forces when aligned us-
ing an external electric ﬁeld.
In comparison to the
interactions characteristic of non-polar molecular and
atomic species, these forces are highly anisotropic, much
stronger, and of much longer range, which may provide
access to qualitatively new regimes previously inaccessi-
ble to ultracold atomic and molecular systems. For ex-
ample, such strongly interacting molecules might be used
as the qubits of a scalable quantum computer [1]. New
types of highly correlated many-body states might be-
come accessible for study such as BCS-like superﬂuids [2],
supersolid and checkerboard states, or two-dimensional
Bose metals [3]. Control of ultracold chemical reactions
[4] has been proposed using weakly bound, electric ﬁeld-
linked states of participating molecules [5]. Finally, the
large polarizability of polar molecules strongly enhances
parity-violating eﬀects such as those due to an electric
dipole moment of the electron and nuclear anapole mo-
ments [6]; the long coherence times associated with ultra-
cold temperatures could lead to dramatically increased
sensitivity in measurements of these eﬀects.

Unfortunately, the powerful techniques of atomic laser
cooling cannot be extended directly to most molecular
species, due to their lack of nearly-closed transitions
capable of supporting large, sustained optical cooling
forces. Successful eﬀorts aimed at the production of ul-
tracold polar molecules have so far used either buﬀer-gas
cooling, where molecules are thermalized with cryogenic
helium gas [7], or Stark-slowing, where a beam of po-
lar molecules cooled internally in a supersonic expansion
is slowed using time-varying electric ﬁelds [8]. Both of
these methods have resulted in trapped molecules with
temperatures of ∼10-100 mK [7, 8], much higher than

the typical ∼1-100 µK accessible with atoms using laser
cooling. Attempts to bridge this gap with evaporative
cooling are underway; however, molecular Feshbach res-
onances [9] and inelastic losses [10] may make this route
diﬃcult or even impossible.
Another approach is

to form ultracold diatomic
molecules in binary collisions between ultracold atoms.
This can occur either through photoassociation [11, 12,
13, 14, 15] where atom pairs are resonantly coupled
to electronically excited molecular bound states and
subsequently decay to ground-state molecules, or Fesh-
bach resonance, where a single, weakly-bound rovibra-
tional level is tuned directly into resonance with the free
atoms’ collision energy using a magnetic or optical ﬁeld
[17, 18, 19, 20]. The translational and rotational temper-
atures of the resulting molecules are determined by the
initial atomic sample, allowing well-established atomic
cooling methods, which routinely reach the nanokelvin
regime, to be exploited. An important limitation, how-
ever, is that the molecules are typically formed in highly
excited vibrational states, which are unstable with re-
spect to inelastic collisions; therefore, a method for trans-
ferring them to the vibrational ground state is ultimately
necessary [14].

Large numbers of homonuclear (non-polar) bi-alkali
molecules have already been produced using these tech-
niques, in thermal [11, 12, 14, 15] as well as quantum-
degenerate [17, 18, 19, 20] atomic samples. In light of
these successes, several authors have discussed the pos-
sible extension of these methods to laser-cooled binary
mixtures of two atomic species [16], where (heteronu-
clear) polar diatomic molecules can be formed via inter-
species collisions [21, 22, 23].
In recent experiments,
NaCs+ and RbCs+ molecular ions formed in the pres-
ence of near-resonant light have indeed been observed in
small numbers [22, 23]; however, these observations did
not permit a detailed analysis of the formation mecha-
nism, and therefore could not chart a path towards the
production of ultracold, neutral polar molecules.

In this Report, we describe the production of electron-
ically excited, polar RbCs∗ molecules via photoassocia-
tion in an ultracold (T ∼ 100µK), trapped mixture of
85Rb and 133Cs atoms. We have directly observed their
electronic, vibrational, rotational, and hyperﬁne struc-
ture, as well as the DC stark eﬀect in an applied electric
ﬁeld. A combined analysis of our observations and pre-
vious spectroscopic data allows us to infer ground-state
molecular formation rates via spontaneous decay of up to
5 × 105 molecules/s per level in deeply bound vibrational
levels of the X1Σ+ electronic ground state. Our calcula-
tions further indicate that population in such levels could
be transferred to the stable vibrational ground state of
RbCs with a single, stimulated Raman transition.

Photoassociation (PA), shown schematically in Fig. 1,
occurs when two colliding ground state atoms absorb a
photon and are promoted to a weakly bound, electron-
ically excited molecular state [13, 25]. As indicated in
Fig. 1(b), the weakly bound states accessed in heteronu-
clear PA are of much shorter range than their homonu-
clear counterparts; this diﬀerence arises from the fact
that at long range, in their ﬁrst excited state, two atoms
of the same atomic species interact via the resonant-
dipole interaction (with potential V (R) ∝ R−3), whereas
two atoms of diﬀerent species interact via much shorter-
ranged van der Waals forces (V (R) ∝ R−6) [21, 26]. In
the latter case, the wavefunction overlap between the
initial, extended free-atom ground state Ψf,g(R) and
the excited molecular bound state Ψb,e(R) (typically ex-
pressed in terms of the so-called Franck-Condon factor
|hΨf,g|Ψb,ei|2) is signiﬁcantly smaller for a given excited
state binding energy, requiring a higher PA intensity.
However, a more important consequence of the short-
range character of these states is a larger Franck-Condon
factor for decay to deeply bound vibrational levels of the
ground X1Σ+ state, as we discuss in more detail below.
Our observations are made in a dual-species magneto-
optical trap (MOT). We excite colliding atom pairs in
our trap into RbCs∗ molecular states below the lowest ly-
ing excited asymptote, correlating to Rb 5S1/2+Cs 6P1/2
(this is the most favorable choice for our purposes since
these states cannot undergo predissociation [28]). After a
colliding pair is excited, it decays spontaneously either to
a ground-state RbCs molecule, or back to free Rb and Cs
atoms which typically both have enough kinetic energy to
be expelled from the two traps. The signature of RbCs∗
formation is then a resonant steady-state depletion of
both the Rb and Cs traps induced by the PA laser. For
optimal sensitivity to the formation of RbCs∗, we maxi-
mize the PA-induced loss rate (which is proportional to
the product of the Rb and Cs densities integrated over
the PA beam proﬁle) while minimizing all other intrinsic
losses that compete with it to determine the steady-state
trap populations. To accomplish this, we use forced dark-
spot MOTs [27] to increase the Rb and Cs densities by
factors of 9 and 4 (relative to “bright” MOTs), respec-

FIG. 1: Schematic of the 85Rb + 133Cs + γP A → RbCs∗ pho-
toassociation process. The vertical axis is potential energy,
and the horizontal axis is the internuclear distance R. (a) Free
Rb + Cs atom pairs are excited during a collision (upward
arrow) to bound molecular states below the Rb 5S1/2 + Cs
6P1/2 atomic asymptote (horizontal line). They then decay
either to ground state molecular levels (dashed, downward-
pointing arrow), or to energetic free atoms. (b) Detailed view
of the RbCs∗ potentials at long range, dissociating to Cs 6P1/2
and 6P3/2, labelled by their Hund’s case (c) quantum number
Ω = 0+, 0−, 1, 2. The solid horizontal line indicates a weakly-
bound RbCs∗ level just below the Rb 5S1/2+Cs 61/2 asymp-
tote, which is of much shorter range than in the homonuclear
case; this is illustrated by the dotted line, which is the poten-
tial for the analogous 0+
u state of Cs2. In general, the vibra-
tional levels observed in this work are in fact coupled mixtures
of “unperturbed” levels of the same symmetry dissociating to
Cs 6P1/2 and 6P3/2; an example of such a pair of levels, for
the 0+ state, is shown as horizontal solid and dashed lines.
This mixing is much stronger than in the homonuclear case
due to the shorter range of the asymptotic potential.

tively, while reducing their intrinsic losses due to light-
assisted inelastic collisions [27]. These intrinsic losses are
further reduced in the Rb trap by signiﬁcantly decreasing
the intensity of the trapping light. The same procedure
could not be used in the Cs trap, where these losses were
kept high to make it insensitive to the many strong Cs∗
2
PA resonances, which otherwise would have caused large
depletion of its population.

The experimental apparatus incorporated straightfor-
ward extensions of well-known techniques, so only a few
salient features will be mentioned here. First, the trap-
ping beams for the two MOTs were individually cou-
pled into two separate optical ﬁbers (for mode ﬁltering
and long-term mechanical stability) and were directed
into the vacuum chamber using two separate sets of
optics. This independent adjustment of the two traps
proved essential for reliable, simultaneous optimization
of both their spatial overlap and individual atomic den-
sities. The Ti:sapphire PA laser produced 600 mW of
power around 895 nm; its frequency was monitored using
both a wavemeter and a Fabry-Perot optical spectrum
analyzer, providing absolute and relative accuracies of
150 MHz and 5 MHz, respectively. To increase the PA
intensity, the output of this laser was modematched into
a build-up cavity placed around the vacuum chamber,
which was actively locked to the laser frequency using
the H¨ansch-Couillaud method [32], and had an e−2 mode
radius at the atom traps of 380 µm (the typical size of
the MOT clouds was 750 µm); this provided intensities
up to ∼ 4 × 107 W/m2.

The peak density n, atom number N , and spatial over-
lap of the two atomic clouds were measured using two-
color absorptive imaging from two orthogonal directions.
Typical values were: NRb = 4×108, nRb = 7×1011 cm−3,
and NCs = 3 × 108, nCs = 3 × 1011 cm−3. An indepen-
dent measurement of the atom numbers obtained using
resonance ﬂuorescence conﬁrmed these values to within
30%. The temperatures of the two clouds were observed
to be 55 µK for Rb and 140 µK for Cs, using time-of-
ﬂight absorption imaging. The lower atom number and
density and the higher temperature observed for the Cs
MOT resulted from its higher trapping laser intensity,
discussed above.

In order to detect the trap loss induced by photoassoci-
ation, the ﬂuorescence rate of each MOT was monitored
with a photodiode, as the frequency of the PA laser was
scanned in discrete steps. An example of the observed
photoassociation signals is shown in Fig. 2. The features
common to both Rb and Cs traces can be identiﬁed as
RbCs∗ states; we have veriﬁed that these features disap-
pear in the Rb trace if the Cs trap is removed, indicating
that both species are indeed necessary to observe them.
From the observed depletion of the Rb trap as large as
70% and the evolution of its atom number during load-
ing with and without the PA laser present, we estimate
resonant PA rates as large as ∼ 1.5 × 108 s−1, which

FIG. 2: RbCs∗ photoassociation signals. The upper and lower
traces are the ﬂuorescence signals from the Cs and Rb traps,
respectively, vs. detuning from the 6S1/2, F = 3 → 6P1/2,
F ′ = 3 transition of Cs at 11178.4172 cm−1. (a) The three
features marked with dashed lines, common to both traces,
arise from RbCs∗. From our analysis, we identify them as the
J = 0, 1, 2 rotational components (J denotes the quantum
number associated with the total molecular angular momen-
tum, except for nuclear spin) of a 0− vibrational level dissoci-
ating to Cs 6P1/2 with an outer turning point near 13.2˚A. A
Cs2 rotational series is also identiﬁed by its appearance purely
in the Cs trace; this series is associated with a 0+
u (6P1/2) level
of Cs2 having an outer turning point near 24.8˚A(Fig. 1(b)
shows the relevant potential for this state). Clearly evident is
a dramatic diﬀerence in rotational splittings between the two
cases, arising from the much shorter-range character of the
RbCs∗ state. (b) Partially resolved hyperﬁne-rotational sub-
structure of an observed RbCs∗ level with Ω 6= 0. Note that
this complicated structure is indeed associated with RbCs∗,
as it is present in both the Rb (lower) and Cs (upper) traces.

is close to the expected maximum rate for our parame-
ters determined by probability conservation in a binary
scattering process (the so-called “unitarity limit”) [25].
In fact, we have directly veriﬁed for several resonances
that the loss rate saturates as a function of intensity,
and these saturated loss rates are observed to scale ap-

proximately linearly with both atomic densities, as ex-
pected. Also, the observed intensities at which the loss
saturates are consistent with our estimates based on a
simple WKB approximation for the ground-state wave-
function at short range [21, 25], and are typically 106
W/m2 or greater, signiﬁcantly higher than in homonu-
clear experiments [13, 16].

We have observed many RbCs∗ molecular states over
the detuning range from 10 to 100 cm−1 below the
Rb 5S1/2+Cs 6P1/2 atomic limit, and we ﬁnd vibra-
tional progressions corresponding to the expected Ω =
0+, 0−, 1, and 2 potentials dissociating to both the 6P1/2
and 6P3/2 atomic limits, as shown in Fig 1(b). The
Ω = 0± states have no hyperﬁne splitting in leading
order, and are therefore identiﬁed by their clean rota-
tional structure, as in Fig 2(a), where the quantum num-
ber J in the ﬁgure gives the total angular momentum
of the molecule except for the nuclear spin. Lines with
J > 3 are absent in these rotational series, since at our
temperatures the centrifugal barrier prevents all but the
ℓ = 0, 1, 2 partial waves from penetrating to the short
ranges where photoassociation occurs [13, 25] (here, ℓ
is the quantum number associated with the rotational
angular momentum of the atomic collision). The indi-
vidual components of these rotational series are observed
to be as narrow as 10 MHz, close to the atomic excited-
state natural linewidth of Cs, and as broad as 80 MHz.
We have veriﬁed in a few cases that power broadening
does not contribute signiﬁcantly to these larger widths;
they may instead result from second-order hyperﬁne cou-
pling to nearby levels with nonzero Ω. The Ω = 1, 2 fea-
tures display a complex hyperﬁne-rotational structure, as
shown in Fig. 2(b), the analysis of which is in progress.
We have also demonstrated the polar nature of the ob-
served RbCs∗ states by applying electric ﬁelds up to 390
V/cm, as shown in Fig 3. The observed Stark eﬀect on
this rotational series agrees in form with that expected
for a polar, diatomic rigid rotor, as illustrated by the ﬁt
shown in the ﬁgure. From this ﬁt we extract an electric
dipole moment for this level of µe = 1.3 ± 0.1 Debye,
where the error is due to uncertainty in the applied elec-
tric ﬁeld.

We have analyzed our observations of the Ω = 0± lev-
els by ﬁtting them to a model of the full RbCs∗ poten-
tials, based on ab initio calculations and previous spec-
troscopic data on low-lying vibrational levels [30]. A
thorough discussion of this analysis will be presented else-
where. Fig. 4 shows a comparison between the observed
J = 0 vibrational energies and rotational constants of
the Ω = 0± states, and the best ﬁt from our model, to
illustrate the quality of the agreement. In the 0− case
shown in Fig. 4(a), two distinct vibrational series are
clearly evident, with spacings on the order of 3 cm−1
and 15 cm−1. These correspond to vibrational states
in the two diﬀerent 0− potentials dissociating adiabati-
cally to the 6P1/2 and 6P3/2 atomic limits, shown in Fig.

FIG. 3: Stark eﬀect in RbCs∗. Rb trap-loss photoassociation
spectrum of a RbCs∗ Ω = 0+ state, for E = 0 and E = 370
V/cm. The vertical scale is referenced to a detuning of -
55.64 cm−1 from the Rb 5S1/2, F = 3 + Cs 6P1/2, F ′ = 3
limit. A ﬁt of the E = 370 V/cm spectrum is also shown,
based on the expected Stark eﬀect for the rotational levels
of a diatomic rigid rotor, as illustrated schematically in the
ﬁgure. The only free parameters in the ﬁt are the electric
dipole moment, for which we extract µe = 1.3±0.1 Debye, and
the overall depth of the features. The position of the series
and its rotational constant are held ﬁxed at values obtained
by ﬁtting the E = 0 spectrum, as are the relative heights of
the two J = 1 components, based on the assumption of an
isotropic distribution of dipole orientations in our sample.

1(b). The latter are bound by more than 550 cm−1, and
have outer turning points as small as 9˚Aat our detunings;
note that these features would be diﬃcult to see without
our high photoassociation intensity, as their free-bound
Franck-Condon factors are relatively small. Also evident
in the ﬁgure is a coupling between these two interleaved
vibrational series, causing a localized perturbation in the
rotational constant when an accidental near-degeneracy
occurs. Fig. 4(b) shows the same plot for the 0+ lev-
els; here, the coupling is so much stronger that almost
no trace remains of the “unperturbed” vibrational struc-
ture, and all levels have a strongly mixed character, as
illustrated by the wavefunction in the inset. This type of
coupled vibrational structure has been discussed theoret-
2 and Cs∗
ically [13] for Rb∗
2, and was directly observed [11]
u level of Cs∗
in a 0+
2, where it was used to enhance the pho-
toassociative production of ground state Cs2 molecules
via decay at an intermediate outer turning point like that
shown in the inset to Fig. 4(b). In the present case, how-
ever, the 0+ state mixing is much stronger than in Cs∗
2
due to the shorter-range character of the asymptotic van
der Waals potential. As a ﬁnal note, the values we extract
from our analysis for the long-range dispersion coeﬃcient
C6 of the RbCs∗ A1Σ+
0 states shown
in Fig. 1(a) all agree with ab initio calculations [26] to
within a few percent. We are presently unable to assign
deﬁnitive uncertainties to these values, however, due to
the large parameter space and limited experimental data.

FIG. 4: Comparison between observed rovibrational levels for
the Ω = 0± states and those calculated from our ﬁtted RbCs∗
potentials. Open circles denote the observed levels, and solid
circles the ﬁtted values. Each point corresponds to a rota-
tional series like that shown in Fig. 2(a); the horizontal axis
gives the energy Ev,0 of its J = 0 rotational component, and
the vertical axis gives its rotational constant Bv, extracted us-
ing the relation: Ev,J − Ev,0 = BvJ(J + 1). Most of the gaps
in the observations arise where an expected 0± level nearly
coincides with another having Ω 6= 0 (e.g. Fig. 2(b)), and
could not be clearly identiﬁed. In (a), two interleaving vibra-
tional series are clearly evident, arising from two 0− states,
one dissociating to 6P1/2 (weakly bound, small Bv value) and
the other to 6P3/2 (deeply bound, large Bv value), as shown in
Fig. 1(b). When a near-degeneracy occurs between these vi-
brational levels, a perturbation is observed in the rotational
constant where the long-range level acquires some shorter-
range character. This eﬀect arises from a non-adiabatic mix-
ing of these levels at short range near an avoided crossing
induced by the spin-orbit interaction [13]. (b) A much larger
mixing is evident in the 0+ case, where almost no trace of the
corresponding two individual vibrational series remains. The
extremely large coupling between the two 0+ states results
from the inherently short-range character of the asymptotic
potential, and produces states that can have both relatively
long-range outer turning points (associated with the 6P1/2
threshold) and substantial A1Σ+ character at short range.
This is illustrated in the inset, which shows the vibrational
wavefunction for the 0+ level at -55.63 cm−1 mentioned in the
text. At long range, it is a strong mixture between states dis-
sociating adiabatically to Cs 6P1/2 and 6P3/2, as evidenced
by the two outer turning points marked (1) and (2); at the
inner turning point marked (3), however, it is almost purely
A1Σ+, resulting in large bound-bound Franck-Condon factors
for decay to X1Σ+ state levels near v = 62 with nearly the
same inner turning point.

5

Using our model of the full RbCs∗ potentials, we can
make quantitative estimates of the rate at which deeply
bound ground-state molecules are formed in our trap
through spontaneous decay to the X1Σ+ state. For
example, taking our estimated photoassociation rate of
1.5 × 108 s−1 tuned onto the Ω = 0+, J = 1 resonance at
a detuning of -55.63 cm−1, we predict that X1Σ+ state
molecules will be formed in vibrational levels near v = 62,
bound by almost 1300 cm−1, at a rate of ∼ 5 × 105 s−1
per level. In contrast to the homonuclear case, extremely
deeply bound molecules are formed at large rates via de-
cay at a spatially coincident inner vibrational turning
point of the ground and excited levels [31]. This arises
quite generally from the shorter-range character of the
asymptotic potential as well as the resulting strong 0+
channel coupling discussed above, which together can
produce a large probability density at the inner turning
point of the A1Σ+ excited state. The resulting deeply
bound ground state molecules in J = 0, 2 rovibrational
levels could be easily transferred with high eﬃciency to
v = 0, J = 0 using a single two-photon stimulated Ra-
man transition; for example, we calculate that the two
Franck-Condon factors for such a transition via an inter-
mediate state ∼ 3900 cm−1 below the Rb 5S1/2 + Cs
6P1/2 limit are both ∼ 10−2. These transitions could
easily be saturated using standard pulsed lasers.

In summary, we have demonstrated heteronuclear pho-
toassociation into polar RbCs∗ molecular states in a
laser-cooled, dense mixture of 85Rb and 133Cs atoms,
with large photoassociation rates up to ∼ 1.5 × 108
s−1. Theoretical interpretation of our spectra suggest
large molecule formation rates via spontaneous decay
into deeply bound rovibrational levels of the ground
X1Σ+ state as high as 5 × 105 s−1 per level, due
to the inherently short-range character of the RbCs∗
states we excite. We plan to detect these ground state
molecules using resonance-enhanced two-photon ioniza-
tion [11, 12, 14, 15] and trap them in an optical dipole
trap. A subsequent two-photon Raman transition from
one of the well-populated levels to the rovibrational
ground state should allow us to produce a large sample
of stable ultracold polar molecules.

shift between 6Li and 7Li is also suﬃciently small that
photoassociation into 6Li7Li∗ is essentially homonuclear
in character.

[24] Heteronuclear photoassociation of 6Li7Li∗ has in fact
been clearly observed [16]; however, because of the iden-
tical nuclear charges, this molecule is not expected to

[31] Alternatively, one might use an Ω = 1 level dissociat-
ing to Cs 6P3/2. These levels are expected in general to
contain a strong admixture of the (1)1Π state which, al-
though not yet constrained by spectroscopic data at short
range, is predicted to have an inner turning point much
closer to that of v = 0 of the X state. We calculate result-
ing molecular formation rates of 3×106 s−1 in ground lev-
els near v = 18, bound by almost 3000 cm−1. Note that
this is only possible because of the absence of g/u sym-
metry in the heteronuclear case, since the corresponding
(homonuclear) (1)1Πg state cannot decay to the X1Σ+
g
state due to this symmetry.

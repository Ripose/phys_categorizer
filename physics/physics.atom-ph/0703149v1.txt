Femtosecond high-order harmonic transient absorption spectroscopy is used to resolve the com-
plete |j, mi quantum state distribution of Xe+ produced by optical strong-ﬁeld ionization of
Xe atoms at 800 nm. Probing at the Xe N4/5 edge yields a population distribution ρj,|m| of
ρ3/2,1/2 : ρ1/2,1/2 : ρ3/2,3/2 = 75 ± 6 : 12 ± 3 : 13 ± 6%. The result is compared to a tunnel
ionization calculation with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, revealing nonadiabatic ionization
behavior. The sub-50-fs time resolution paves the way for table-top extreme ultraviolet absorption
probing of ultrafast dynamics.

Studies of laser-atom interactions in the nonperturba-
tive, strong-ﬁeld regime elucidate novel phenomena such
as above-threshold ionization [1, 2], nonsequential dou-
ble ionization [3], and high-order harmonic generation
[4, 5, 6]. While these processes are extensively stud-
ied both experimentally and theoretically, details remain
unknown about the |j, mi state distribution of the pho-
toion produced by the initial photoionization step (m is
the projection quantum number associated with the total
angular momentum j of the hole). Moreover, experimen-
tal tests of theoretical models for strong-ﬁeld ionization
mostly rely on measuring the ion yield as a function of
laser peak intensity [7]. The strong dependence of ioniza-
tion yields on the orbital angular momentum and its di-
rection relative to the laser polarization axis, as predicted
by most theoretical models (e.g., the Ammosov-Delone
Krainov (ADK) rates [8]), suggests that knowledge of
the complete |j, mi state distribution can be used as an
additional benchmark for theory. Young et al. recently
reported the use of synchrotron x-ray pulses to probe
the hole-orbital alignment of Kr+ photoions generated in
the strong-ﬁeld ionization of Kr [9]. The unresolved ﬁne-
structure transitions prevented retrieval of the complete
|j, mi state distribution. However, the observed degree
of alignment is reproduced by the |j, mi state distribu-
tion obtained by tunnel ionization calculations with the
inclusion of spin-orbit coupling [10].

Here we investigate the experimental and theoretical
strong-ﬁeld ionization of xenon to extract the complete
|j, mi quantum state distribution. Femtosecond extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is
demonstrated with a laser-based, high-order harmonic
probe source for the experiments; results are compared
to tunnel ionization calculations that incorporate spin-
orbit coupling. The resultant angular momentum distri-
bution and hole-orbital alignment of the Xe+ photoions
are measured by probing the transition from the 4d core
level to the 5p valence shell. These measurements allow

the determination of the complete |j, mi quantum state
distribution, which is compared to theory.

The schematic of the experimental setup is illustrated
in Fig. 1. Brieﬂy, the ampliﬁed output from a commercial
Ti:sapphire laser system (2.4 W, 800 nm, 45 fs, 1 kHz)
is sent to a 20 : 80 beamsplitter to produce the opti-
cal pump and high-order harmonic generation beam, re-
spectively. High-order harmonics in the EUV region are
generated by focusing the laser light into a 7-cm-long,
150-µm internal diameter capillary ﬁlled with 6.0 × 103
Pa of neon [11]. The estimated photon ﬂux at the source
is 104 photons per pulse for the high-order harmonic cen-
tered at 55.4 eV. A pair of 0.2-µm-thick Al foils is used to
reject the residual 800-nm light and transmit the high-
order harmonics. After reﬂection by a toroidal mirror,
the high-order harmonics are refocused into a 2-mm-long
gas cell ﬁlled with 2.7×103 Pa of Xe [12]. Scanning knife-
edge measurements give a beam waist of 21 µm for the
high-order harmonics. The transmitted EUV radiation
is spectrally dispersed in a home-built spectrometer and
detected with a thermoelectrically-cooled CCD camera.
A dielectric-coated mirror with a 1-mm-diameter inter-
nal bore hole allows the optical pump beam to overlap
with the EUV probe beam in a collinear geometry. A
half-waveplate inserted into the path of the pump beam
allows the relative polarization of the pump and probe
beams to be varied. The polarization purity of the pump
beam is characterized by an extinction ratio of > 200 : 1.
The 800 nm pump pulse energy incident on the gas cell is
0.13 mJ. Further measurements conﬁrm that the pump
pulse energy after the gas cell remains unchanged (by
< 3%) upon rotation of the half-waveplate. In the pres-
ence of the Xe gas, the pump pulse duration increases
slightly to 49 fs and the elliptical focal spot of the pump
beam is characterized by horizontal and vertical beam
waists of 61 and 34 µm, respectively; these parameters
yield a peak intensity of 8 × 1013 W/cm2 for the pump
pulse. The pump-probe time delay is varied by means

Transient absorption spectra are obtained by using spec-
tra collected at −500 fs time delay as the reference [13]; a
negative time delay implies that the probe pulse arrives
at the sample before the pump pulse. Error bars reported
below correspond to 95% conﬁdence interval limits.

The transient absorption spectrum of Xe+ acquired
at a pump-probe time delay of +500 fs and a paral-
lel relative polarization between pump and probe beams
is shown in Fig. 2 [14]. The peaks at 55.4 eV and
56.1 eV correspond to the 5p−1
5/2(2D5/2)
1/2(2P1/2) → 4d−1
and 5p−1
3/2(2D3/2) transitions, respec-
tively, in agreement with literature values [15] (nl−1

bolizes a hole in the nl orbital with angular momentum j;
the corresponding term symbol is given in parentheses).
The ratio of the areas of the two ﬁne-structure absorp-
tion lines, deﬁned as R = I k
1/2→3/2, is found to
be R = 6.5 ± 1.1. The time-evolution of the Xe+ 2P3/2
state is followed by varying the pump-probe time delay
while monitoring the transient absorption signal at 55.4
eV. The resultant time traces obtained for parallel and
perpendicular relative polarizations between pump and
probe beams are shown in Fig. 3. Fitting the time traces
to a convolution of a step function with a Gaussian yields
fwhm values of 37 ± 1 fs and 39 ± 2 fs for parallel and per-
pendicular relative polarizations, respectively. Note that
the temporal signal corresponds to a cross-correlation of
the Xe+ population growth with the EUV pulse [16].
From the polarization-dependent absorption at positive
time delays ≥ 50 fs, the polarization anisotropy, deﬁned
3/2→5/2)/(I k
as r = (I k
3/2→5/2), is
found to be r = 0.07 ± 0.01. The observed anisotropy im-
plies the existence of hole-orbital alignment in the Xe+
2P3/2 state produced by strong-ﬁeld ionization. Since
the hole orbital is directed along the polarization axis
of the pump beam (which also deﬁnes the quantization
axis), the hole population of the m = ±1/2 sublevels is
expected to be greater than that of the m = ±3/2 sub-
levels, as observed experimentally. To verify the reliabil-
ity of the measured polarization anisotropy, a separate

set of measurements is performed for the 2P1/2 → 2D3/2
transition, for which no anisotropy is observed. This re-
sult agrees with the fact that alignment cannot exist in
a 2P1/2 state [17].

that the 2P3/2 state of Xe+ produced by strong-ﬁeld ioniza-
tion is aligned.

The experimental results for the ratio of the ﬁne-
structure absorption R and the polarization anisotropy r
can be used to extract the complete quantum state distri-
bution. The description of the EUV-probe step follows
Ref. [10]. Let ρj,|m| denote the probability of ﬁnding
Xe+ with a hole in either the 5pj,m or the 5pj,−m or-
bital. Making the dipole approximation and employing
standard angular momentum algebra [17], we obtain

and d is the electric dipole operator. A multiconﬁgura-
tion Dirac-Fock calculation performed with the program
package GRASP2 [18] gives ξ = 1.6. From Eqs. (1)
and (2), and the experimental values for R and r, the
complete quantum state distribution of Xe+ generated
by strong-ﬁeld ionization can be extracted. The results
are summarized in Table I. We note that spectroscopic
probing of the photoion by transient absorption allows
direct retrieval of its quantum state distribution, which
cannot be obtained from other experimental approaches
to the study of strong-ﬁeld ionization, such as energy-
and angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy [19].

Tunnel ionization calculations with the inclusion of
spin-orbit coupling are performed to model the exper-
imental results described above. To calculate the pro-
duction rates for the various ionization channels, the ef-
fective one-electron model described in Ref. [10] is em-
ployed. The model treats strong-ﬁeld ionization within
the tunneling picture and includes the eﬀect of spin-
orbit interaction. The approach makes use of a ﬂexible
ﬁnite-element basis set and determines ionization rates
in this square-integrable basis using a complex absorb-
ing potential [20]. Parameters that are used in the cal-
culations are 0.13 mJ for the pulse energy, 49 fs fwhm
for the pulse duration, and 45 µm for the cylindrically-
symmetric beam waist. The |j, mi populations are cal-
culated after the laser pulse by numerical integration
of rate equations [10] and are normalized such that
ρ3/2,1/2 + ρ1/2,1/2 + ρ3/2,3/2 = 1. The calculated frac-
tional populations on the laser axis are shown in Table I.
These calculations also allow us to verify that eﬀects due
to spatial averaging by the probe beam are smaller than
the experimental errors for the ρj,|m| distribution.

Within the given uncertainties, good agreement for the
ρ3/2,1/2 : ρ1/2,1/2 ratio is obtained between experiment
and theory. This suggests that spin-orbit interaction is
adequately treated in the tunnel ionization model em-
ployed in the calculations. Moreover, the calculations re-
veal that there is very little mixing between the 5p3/2 and
5p1/2 valence orbitals even at the saturation intensity for
Xe+ production. This implies that the laser ﬁeld is not
suﬃciently strong to uncouple the spin-orbit interaction.
Furthermore, the tunneling calculation predicts that
ρ3/2,3/2 ≪ ρ3/2,1/2, which supports the experimental ob-
servation that the Xe+ 2P3/2 state produced by strong-
ﬁeld ionization is aligned. However, it is notable that
the measured ρ3/2,3/2 : ρ3/2,1/2 ratio of 0.17 ± 0.09 is sig-
niﬁcantly larger than that predicted by the calculation,
which gives a value of 0.04 for this ratio. The discrep-
ancy between experiment and theory can be attributed

to the partial breakdown of the adiabatic (quasi-static)
approximation employed in the tunnel ionization model.
The adiabatic approximation requires that the elec-
trons within the atomic potential and those undergoing
tunnel ionization respond instantaneously to the laser
ﬁeld. This approximation is analogous to the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation frequently invoked in the
study of molecular dynamics, whereby electrons are as-
sumed to respond instantaneously to the electric ﬁeld
exerted by the nuclei. The ratio of the tunneling time to
the period of the laser ﬁeld is given by the Keldysh adi-
abaticity parameter γ [21], implying that the adiabatic
approximation is valid only when γ ≪ 1. Given that the
experimental conditions yield γ = pIp/2Up ∼ 1.1 (Ip is
the atomic ionization potential and Up is the pondero-
motive potential), such a quasi-static approximation is
no longer wholly valid, i.e., ionization becomes nonadia-
batic with respect to the laser ﬁeld. Under such circum-
stances, a nonperturbative multiphoton Floquet treat-
ment of strong-ﬁeld ionization becomes necessary [22].
Indeed, previous investigations of Xe strong-ﬁeld ioniza-
tion revealed discrete peaks atop above-threshold ion-
ization features in the photoelectron spectra, suggesting
that ionization occurs mainly via a multiphoton path-
way [23, 24]; the discrete peaks originate from resonance-
enhanced multiphoton ionization that occurs when the
ﬁeld-dressed ground state crosses the ac Stark-shifted
Rydberg states [25]. On the sub-cycle timescale, nona-
diabatic transitions can occur between the ﬁeld-dressed
ground state and the Rydberg levels while varying the
instantaneous phase of the laser ﬁeld, akin to transi-
tions between adiabatic potential energy surfaces in the
non-Born-Oppenheimer regime of molecular dynamics.
Note that nonadiabatic electron dynamics have previ-
ously been observed in molecular strong-ﬁeld ionization,
in which the spatial delocalization of electrons leads to
the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation [26].

In the present work, the importance of nonadiabatic ef-
fects in atomic strong-ﬁeld ionization is substantiated by
the results of two spin-orbit-free calculations—a tunnel-
ing calculation and a multiphoton Floquet-type calcula-
tion [27]—performed at an intensity of 8 × 1013 W/cm2.
The Floquet calculation predicts that the ratio of the
ml = ±1 : ml = 0 ionization rates is ∼ 2× larger than

that predicted by the tunnel ionization model. There-
fore it is reasonable that the experimentally-measured
ρ3/2,3/2 : ρ3/2,1/2 ratio is larger than that predicted by
the tunneling calculation with spin-orbit coupling. A
valid theoretical comparison with the experimental re-
sult would require a Floquet calculation that incorporates
spin-orbit coupling.

Finally, we note that while recent advances in high-
order harmonic generation have already resulted in the
extension of ultrafast spectroscopy into the EUV do-
main [28, 29, 30, 31], most of the experiments reported
to date have focused on photoelectron spectroscopy due
to the set of discrete harmonics that presents itself as
an attractive photoionization source. By probing transi-
tions from the core level to unoccupied valence levels, pi-
cosecond time-resolved x-ray absorption near-edge spec-
troscopy based on laser-produced plasma [32] and syn-
chrotron [33, 34] sources have been shown to be highly
sensitive to element-speciﬁc electronic structure changes
accompanying photophysical and photochemical trans-
formation. The work here demonstrates the feasibility of
performing transient absorption spectroscopy with sub-
50-fs time resolution using a laser-based, high-order har-
monic source for core-level probing. Work on extending
this technique to the study of ultrafast molecular dynam-
ics is currently in progress.

[12] From the estimated electron rms velocity (1 µm/ps, cor-
responding to an electron temperature of ∼ 10 eV for
the plasma) and typical electron-ion scattering cross-
sections (∼ 10−16 cm2), the time interval between each
electron-ion collision event for the given sample density is
∼ 100 ps. Since this time is much longer than the max-
imum pump-probe time delay employed in the experi-
ments, the observed dynamics are those of single ions,
and the measured alignment distribution is not aﬀected
by electron-ion or ion-ion collisions.

[13] A constant background oﬀset due to stray pump beam
light incident on the CCD camera precludes the use of
the pump-oﬀ spectrum as the reference spectrum.
[14] The minimum at 56.1 eV in the harmonic spectrum col-
lected at −500 fs time delay exists in the weak continuum
underlying the discrete harmonic peaks (note the use of
a log scale); this could result from quantum interferences
and macroscopic phasematching eﬀects in HHG.

[22] Note that the Floquet treatment, which is exact for a
cw laser ﬁeld, yields in the quasi-static limit the tunnel
ionization model. The Floquet treatment itself is a cw
limit to the solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation; the latter becomes necessary when the pulse
envelope changes rapidly on the time scale of one laser
cycle, as is the case for few-cycle pulses. For the 49-fs
pulses used in this study, however, the Floquet treatment
can be approximated as being exact.

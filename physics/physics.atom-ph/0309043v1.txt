An ultrastable optical clock based on neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice is proposed.
Complete control over the light shift is achieved by employing the 5s2 1S0 → 5s5p 3P0 transition of
87Sr atoms as a “clock transition”. Calculations of ac multipole polarizabilities and dipole hyper-
polarizabilities for the clock transition indicate that the contribution of the higher-order light shifts
can be reduced to less than 1 mHz, allowing for a projected accuracy of better than 10

−17.

Careful elimination of perturbations on electronic
states and of motional eﬀects has been considered as a
prerequisite for realizing an atom frequency standard [1].
A single ion trapped in an RF quadrupole ﬁeld is one
of the ideal systems that satisfy these requirements [2],
as the trap prepares a quantum absorber completely at
rest in free space for an extended time and its electric
ﬁeld vanishes at the center of the trap. Employing this
scheme, quantum projection noise (QPN) limited spec-
troscopy [3] has been performed with an expected accu-
racy of 10−18 [1, 4].

Despite its anticipated high accuracy, the stability of
the single-ion based optical clock is severely limited by
QPN; long averaging times are required to meet its ulti-
mate accuracy [5]. The measure of the fractional instabil-
ity is provided by the Allan variance, σy(τ ) = 1
.

required for a single quantum absorber (N = 1) to reach
σy(τ ) = 10−18, corresponding to a total averaging time τ

averaging time increases quadratically and will become
inordinately long.

One may think of increasing the number of quantum
absorbers N as employed in neutral atom based optical
standards [6, 7, 8]. In this case, however, the atom-laser
interaction time sets an upper bound for the Q-factor
since an atom cloud in free space expands with ﬁnite ve-
locity and is strongly accelerated by the gravity during
1012 [6] ob-
the measurement. Hence the highest line Q
tained for neutral atoms is 2 orders of magnitude smaller
than that of a trapped ion. Furthermore, it has been
pointed out that residual Doppler shifts arising from an
imperfect wavefront of the probe beam and atom-atom
collisions during the measurement aﬀect its ultimate ac-
curacy [7, 8].

In this Letter, we discuss the feasibility of an “opti-
cal lattice clock” [9], which utilizes millions of neutral
atoms separately conﬁned in an optical lattice [10] that
is designed to adjust the dipole polarizabilities αE1 for
the probed electronic states in order to cancel light ﬁeld
perturbations on the measured spectrum [11]. In striking
contrast with conventional approaches toward frequency
standards [1], the proposed scheme interrogates atoms
while they are strongly perturbed by an external ﬁeld.
We will show that this perturbation can be canceled out
to below 10−17 by carefully designing the light shift po-
tentials. This scheme permits an exceptionally low in-
10−18 with an interrogation time of
stability of σy(τ )
only τ = 1 s, which may open up new applications of
ultra precise metrology, such as the search for the time
variation of fundamental constants [12] and the real time
monitoring of the gravitational frequency shift.
Figure 1 illustrates the proposed scheme.

Sub-
wavelength conﬁnement provided by the optical lattice
localizes atoms in the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR) [13],
where the ﬁrst order Doppler shift as well as the pho-
ton recoil shift disappears [14, 15] and the second order
Doppler shift can be made negligibly small by sideband-
cooling atoms down to the vibrational ground state
In addition, a 3-dimensional lattice with less

than unity occupation could reduce the collisional fre-
quency shifts [8, 16]. Therefore this scheme simulates a
system where millions of single-ion clocks operate simul-
taneously.

general case depends both on the light wave frequency ω

rections are included in the hyperpolarizability γ(e, ω)
and in the higher-order multipole corrections to the po-
larizability (magnetic dipole M 1 and electric quadrupole
E2 terms in addition to the electric dipole polarizability
αE1):

negligible.

We ﬁrst discuss the cancellation of the electric dipole
polarizabilities αE1(e, ω) that dominate the light shift
perturbations. In order to provide complete control over
perturbations, parameters are preferably speciﬁed by the
frequency ω that is the most accurately measurable value
in experimental physics. Other parameters such as the
light polarization e should have less inﬂuence on the sys-
tem: Our strategy is to employ the J = 0 state that
exhibits a scalar light shift [9]. Here we propose the
5s5p 3P0 forbidden transition (λ0 = 698 nm)
5s2 1S0 →
of 87Sr with nuclear spin I = 9/2 as the “clock” tran-
sition [9], in which we take advantage of the hyperﬁne
mixing of the 3P0 (F = 9/2) state with the 1,3P1 states
[17] to gain a ﬁnite lifetime of Γ−1
0 = 150 s. This tran-
sition rate turned out to be ideal to perform ultra nar-
row spectroscopy, as the blackbody radiation at 300 K
quenches the 3P metastable states of strontium and gives

2

∼

an eﬀective lifetime of
100 s [18]. Experimentally, how-
ever, the attainable line Q-factor will be limited by the
collision-limited lifetime of 10 s at the vacuum pressure
of 10−10 torr and/or by the mean photon-scattering time
(
∼

10 s) of atoms in a far-oﬀ-resonant light trap.
Figure 2 shows the light shift for the 1S0 and 3P0 states
as a function of the trapping laser wavelength with an
intensity of I = 10 kW/cm2. The calculation is per-
formed by summing up the light-shift contributions with
electronic states up to n = 11 orbits [11], in which we
employed new values of the dipole moments determined
in recent experiments [15] to ﬁnd the intersection wave-
length at λL ≈
800 nm. The light shifts around the inter-
section are mainly determined by the states indicated in
Fig. 1(a): The light shift of the 3P0 state can be tuned ar-
bitrarily in the near infrared range, being “pushed down-
ward” by 3S1 and “pulled upward” by the 3D1 state, while
that of the 1S0 state monotonically decreases toward the
dc Stark shift. This tuning mechanism, therefore, can be
similarly applied to heavier alkaline-earth (like) atoms.
At λL the light shift νac changes with the trapping laser
10−9
frequency ω as dνac/dω =
−
for the 1S0 and 3P0 state, respectively. This precision en-
hancement of more than a factor of 109 allows to control
the light shift well within 1 mHz by deﬁning the cou-
pling laser within 1 MHz or 10−8 precision for the optical
frequency, which can be easily accomplished by conven-
tional optical frequency synthesis techniques. Using the
same set of dipole moments as used in the above cal-
culation, the blackbody frequency shift [19] in the clock
transition is estimated to be
2.4 Hz at T = 293 K: The
uncertainty can be reduced to the 10 mHz level by con-
trolling the surrounding temperature variation ∆T
0.5
K. Alternatively, by operating the clock at T = 77 K,
the blackbody shift is dramatically decreased to 10 mHz
because of its T 4 dependence.

10−6, and 2.1

Owing to the hyperﬁne interaction (HFI), the clock
transition no longer consists of simple scalar states; there-
fore the tensor light shift arises. The fraction of the ten-
sor shift in the total light shift is roughly proportional
to δhfs/δ, i.e., the ratio of the hyperﬁne splitting of the
coupled electronic state δhfs to the trapping laser detun-
ing δ to that state. For the 3S1, 3D1, and 1P1 state,
10−5,
as shown in Fig. 1(a), the ratio δhfs/δ is 8.1
10−7, respectively. Therefore the
5.4
tensor shift of the 3P0 state can be 2 orders of magnitude
larger than that of the 1S0 state.
In order to give an
approximate estimate for this tensor shift, we calculated
the polarization-dependent light shift in the 3P0 state,
taking into account the electric-dipole coupling to the
3S1 and 3D1 hyperﬁne manifolds that are energy shifted
due to HFI. Both of these manifolds provide half (
65
kHz) of the total light shift but dominate its tensor com-
ponent: Although higher lying electronic states support
another 50 % of the light shift, their contribution to the
tensor shift can be less than 50 %, as the ratio δhfs/δ

shows the result with the light polarization parameter-
ized as e = cos θ e− + i sin θ e+ (e± represent the unit
vector for σ± polarization), where a bias magnetic ﬁeld of
B0 = 30 mG is applied to reduce the Raman coherences
among the Zeeman substates. The m =
1/2 state can
be best used for the “clock” transition, as it exhibits the
smallest polarization-dependence of less than 1 Hz. By
employing these states, one could control the light shift
within 1 mHz by deﬁning θ within 1 mrad, even if one
applied the linearly polarized trapping laser (θ = π/4)
where the gradient dνac/dθ (= 0.83 Hz/rad) is the largest.
In order to provide an estimate for the higher-order

abilities, we have used the general theory [20, 21, 22,
23, 24] for calculating the light shift for the 5s2 1S0 →
5s5p 3P0 transition on the basis of the Green’s func-
tion method in the Fues’ model potential approximation
[21]. These model potential calculations have reproduced
Fig. 2 to within 3 % accuracy both for the amount of
the ac Stark shifts as well as the intersection frequency
ωL(= 2πc/λL), conﬁrming the validity of these two inde-
pendent approaches.

To calculate the M 1 and E2 contributions to the
polarizability Eq. (2), the magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole atom-ﬁeld interactions should be taken into
account together with the electric dipole term in the am-
plitude,

ˆV (r) = ˆVE1 + ˆVM1 + ˆVE2,

of the interaction Hamiltonian ˆH(r, t) = ˆV (r)e−iωt +

the ground state equals zero, while for the excited state

After the time averaging and angular integration,
the dipole dynamic polarizability and hyperpolarizability
tensors may in general be resolved into 3 and 5 irreducible
parts, αp (p = 0, 1, 2) and γq (q = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), respec-
tively, of which only scalar terms α0 and γ0 contribute
in a state with the total momentum J = 0 [22]. αp and
γq are determined by linear combinations of frequency-
dependent radial matrix elements of the second, third
and fourth orders.

= γc

It is to note ﬁrst that the scalar parts of γ0(e, ω) are
diﬀerent for the linear and circular type of polarization,
γl
0(ω), even for atoms in S-states, while all the
0(ω)
terms of the polarizability in Eq. (2) are independent of
e for a state with J = 0. Secondly, the number and
type of singularities for the hyperpolarizability exceeds
that for the polarizability, and the contribution of these
singularities also depend on the polarization of the light
ﬁeld. E.g., for linearly polarized radiation, there are two-
photon singularities of γl
0(ω) on the J = 0 states, while
for the circular polarization such singularities cannot ap-
pear. So, the hyperpolarizability of the ground state with
two equivalent electrons 5s2 1S0 in Sr may be written as

corresponds to the term α0S−3 in Eq. (5), dominates
the third-order poles of order δ−3. The fourth-order ma-

The two-photon (2ω) resonance singularity on the J = 0

We used the analytic Sturm-series representation of
the Green’s function, corresponding to calculation of the
inﬁnite sums over the total atomic spectrum including
the continuum. Finally, the radial integrals in Eq. (6)

including the higher-order Stark shift conﬁrmed that the
measurement of the unperturbed atomic transition at 1

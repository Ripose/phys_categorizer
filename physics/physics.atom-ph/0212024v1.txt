We report the magnetic trapping of metastable 3P2 atomic strontium. Atoms are cooled in a
magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the dipole allowed 1S0 −1 P1 transition at 461 nm. Decay

of the MOT. Over 108 atoms at a density of 8 × 109 cm
The atom temperature is signiﬁcantly lower than what would be expected from the kinetic and
potential energy of atoms as they are transferred from the MOT. This suggests that thermalization
and evaporative cooling are occurring in the magnetic trap.

Laser-cooled alkaline-earth atoms oﬀer many possibil-
ities for practical applications and fundamental studies.
The two valence electrons in these systems give rise to
triplet and singlet levels connected by narrow intercom-
bination lines that are utilized for optical frequency stan-
dards [? ]. Laser cooling on such a transition in stron-
tium may lead to a fast and eﬃcient route to all-optical
quantum degeneracy [? ? ], and there are abundant
bosonic and fermionic isotopes to use in this pursuit. The
lack of hyperﬁne structure in the bosonic isotopes and the
closed electronic shell in the ground states make alkaline-
earth atoms appealing testing grounds for cold-collision
theories [? ? ? ], and collisions between metastable
alkaline-earth atoms is a relatively new and unexplored
area for research [? ].

In this paper we characterize a technique that should
beneﬁt all these experiments - the continuous load-
ing of metastable 3P2 atomic strontium (88Sr) from a
magneto-optical trap (MOT) into a purely magnetic trap.
This idea was discussed in a recent theoretical study of
alkaline-earth atoms and ytterbium [? ]. Katori et al.
[? ] and Loftus et al. [? ] have also reported observing
this phenomenon in their strontium laser-cooling exper-
iments. Continuous loading of a magnetic trap from a
MOT was recently described for chromium atoms [? ].

This scheme should allow for collection of large num-
bers of atoms at high density since atoms are shelved in a
dark state and less susceptible to light-assisted collisional
loss mechanisms [? ? ? ]. It is an ideal starting place for
many experiments such as sub-Doppler laser-cooling on
a transition from the metastable state, as has been done
with calcium [? ], production of ultracold Rydberg gases
[? ] or plasmas [? ], and evaporative cooling to quantum
degeneracy. Optical frequency standards based on laser-
cooled alkaline-earth atoms, which are currently limited
by high sample temperatures [? ], may beneﬁt from the
ability to trap larger numbers of atoms and evaporatively
cool them in a magnetic trap.

We will ﬁrst describe the operation of the Sr MOT
and how this loads the magnetic trap with 3P2 atoms.
Then we will characterize the loading and decay rates
of atoms in the magnetic trap. Finally, we will present
measurements of the 3P2 sample temperature.

Sr atoms are loaded from a Zeeman-slowed atomic
beam [? ] and cooled and trapped in a standard MOT

lengths are given. Laser light used for the experiment is indi-
cated by solid lines.

[? ]. Both operate on the 461 nm 1S0 − 1P1 transition
(Fig. 1). Blue light is generated by frequency doubling
the output of a Ti:sapphire laser using KNbO3 in two
external buildup cavities [? ]. 150 mW of power, red-
detuned from resonance by 585 MHz, is available for the
Zeeman slower. Three beams of about 1 cm diameter,
each with intensity I ≤ Isat = 45 mW/cm2, and 57 MHz
red-detuned, are sent to the apparatus and retroreﬂected
to produce the 6-beam MOT.

The 30 cm long Zeeman slower connects a vacuum
chamber for the Sr oven and nozzle to the MOT cham-
ber. Each chamber is evacuated by a 75 l/s ion pump.
When the Sr oven is operated at its normal tempera-
ture of about 550◦C, the pressure in the MOT cham-
ber is about 5 × 10−9 torr, and the oven chamber is at
4 × 10−8 torr.

Extended cavity diode lasers at 679 and 707 nm re-
move population from the 3P0 and 3P2 levels. Each laser
provides several hundred µW of power and is locked to
an absorption feature in a discharge cell. These are not
used for operation of the MOT during experiments with
3P2 atoms. They serve to repump atoms from the 3P2
level to the ground state via the 3S1 and 3P1 levels for
imaging diagnostics.

The quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld for the MOT is pro-
duced by ﬂowing up to 80 A of current in opposite di-
rections through two coils of 36 turns each, with coil di-

ameter of 4.3 cm and separation of 7.7 cm. The max-
imum current produces a ﬁeld gradient along the sym-
metry axis of the coils of 115 G/cm. Such a large ﬁeld
gradient, about 10× the norm for an alkali atom MOT,
is required because of the large decay rate of the excited
state (Γ1P1 = 2π × 32 MHz) and the comparatively large
recoil momentum of 461 nm photons.

Typically 107 − 108 atoms are held in the MOT, at
a peak density of n ≈ 1 × 1010 cm−3, with an rms
radius of 1.2 mm and temperatures from 2 − 10 mK.
The cooling limit for the MOT is the Doppler limit
(TDoppler = 0.77 mK) because the ground state lacks de-
generacy and thus cannot support sub-Doppler cooling.
Higher MOT laser power produces higher MOT temper-
ature, but also a larger number of trapped atoms. These
sample parameters are measured with absorption imag-
ing of a near resonant probe beam. The temperature is
determined by monitoring the velocity of ballistic expan-
sion of the atom cloud [? ] after the trap is extinguished.
Atoms escape from the MOT due to 1P1 − 1D2 decay
as discussed in [? ]. From the 1D2 state atoms either
decay to the 3P1 state and then to the ground state and
are recaptured in the MOT, or they decay to the 3P2
state, which has a lifetime of 17 min [? ]. The decay
rates are given in Fig. 1. The resulting MOT lifetime
of 11 − 55 ms was measured by turning oﬀ the Zeeman
slowing laser beam and monitoring the decay of the MOT
ﬂuorescence. The lifetime is inversely proportional to the
fraction of time atoms spend in the 1P1 level, which varies
with MOT laser power. Light-assisted collisional losses
from the MOT [? ] are negligible compared to the rapid
1P1 − 1D2 decay.

The mj = 2 and mj = 1 3P2 states can be trapped in
the MOT quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld. Such a quadrupole
magnetic trap was used for the ﬁrst demonstration of
magnetic trapping of neutral atoms [? ], but in that case
atoms were loaded directly from a Zeeman-slowed atomic
beam.

Near the center of the trap, the magnetic interaction

energy for 3P2 atoms takes the form

Umj = −µmj · B = gµBmj b

x2/4 + y2 + z2/4,

(1)

p

where mj is the angular momentum projection along the
local ﬁeld, g = 3/2 is the g-factor for the 3P2 state, µB
is the Bohr magneton, and b ≤ 115 G/cm is the gra-
dient of the magnetic ﬁeld along the symmetry (y) axis
of the quadrupole coil. For the mj = 2 state and the
maximum b, gµBmj/kB = 200 µK/G and the barrier
height for escape from the center of the magnetic trap is
15 mK. Gravity, which is oriented along z, corresponds
to an eﬀective ﬁeld gradient of only 5 G/cm for Sr and
is neglected in our analysis.

Typical data showing the magnetic trapping is shown
in Fig. 2. We are unable to directly image atoms in the
3P2 state, so we use the 679 and 707 nm lasers to repump
them to the ground state for ﬂuorescence detection on
the 1S0 −1 P1 transition. The details are as follows. The
MOT is operated for tload ≤ 1300 ms during which time

quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld is left on during thold (black trace),
large numbers of 3P2 atoms are magnetically trapped until the
707 nm laser returns them to the ground state. The residual
ﬂuorescence after thold for the gray trace arises from back-
ground scatter oﬀ atoms in the atomic beam. Reloading of
the MOT from the atomic beam is negligible with the Zeeman
slower light blocked. There is a 1 ms delay between the MOT
and 707 nm laser turn on to allow the MOT light intensity to
reach a stable value.

atoms continuously load the magnetic trap. The MOT
and Zeeman slower light is then extinguished, and after a
time thold, the MOT lasers and repump laser at 707 nm
are turned on. The 679 nm laser is left on the entire
time. Any atoms in the 3P2 state are cycled through the
3P1 level to the ground state within 500 µs of repumping,
and they ﬂuoresce in the ﬁeld of the MOT lasers. If the
magnetic ﬁeld is not left on during thold, Fig. 2 shows that
a negligible number of ground state atoms are present in
the MOT when the lasers are turned on. If the magnets
are left on, however, the MOT ﬂuoresence shows that 3P2
atoms were held in the magnetic trap.

The maximum number of 3P2 atoms trapped is about
1 × 108, and the peak density is about 8 × 109 cm−3. To
determine what limits this number, we varied thold and
saw that the number of 3P2 atoms varied as N0e−γthold.
The ﬁts were excellent and the decay rate was propor-
tional to background pressure as shown in Fig. 3a. This
implies that for our conditions, the trap lifetime is limited
by collisions with residual background gas molecules, and
strontium-strontium collisional losses are not a dominant
eﬀect.

The magnetic trap loading rate was determined by
holding thold constant and varying tload. The loading rate
correlates with the atom loss rate from the MOT (Fig.
3b). At low MOT loss rates about 10% of the atoms lost
from the MOT are captured in the magnetic trap. From
the Clebsch-Gordon coeﬃcients involved in atom decay
from the 1P1 state, and the magnetic sublevel distribu-
tion for atoms in the MOT, one expects that about 25%
of the atoms decaying to 3P2 enter the mj = 1 or mj = 2
states. This is signiﬁcantly higher than the largest ob-
served eﬃciencies, and we may be seeing signs of other
processes, such as losses due to collisions with MOT
atoms. This phenomenon dominated dynamics during
loading of a magnetic trap from a chromium MOT [? ].

FIG. 3: (a) The lifetime of atoms in the magnetic trap is lim-
ited by collisions with background gas molecules. The linear
ﬁt extrapolates to zero at zero pressure within statistical un-
certainties. Inset: A typical ﬁt of the decay of the number of
trapped atoms to a single exponential. (b) The magnetic trap
loading rate is plotted against the MOT loss rate. Data cor-
respond to various MOT laser powers and slow-atom ﬂuxes
from the atomic beam.

At larger MOT loss rates (corresponding to higher
MOT laser intensities, MOT temperatures, and trapped
3P2 atom densities), the eﬃciency of loading the mag-
netic trap decreases by about a factor of two. MOT tem-
peratures approach the trap depth for the largest loading
rates and we attribute the decreasing eﬃciency to escape
of atoms over the magnetic barrier.

The 500 µs required for repumping is fast compared
to the timescale for motion of the atoms, so absorption
images of ground state atoms immediately after repump-
ing provides a measure of the density distribution of the
magnetically trapped sample. For these measurements,
the magnetic trap is loaded for 1.3 s. Then the magnetic
ﬁeld is turned oﬀ and the repump lasers are turned on.
After 500 µs, an 80 µs pulse of a weak 461 nm probe
beam (I ≪ Isat), 12.5 MHz detuned below resonance,
illuminates the atom cloud and falls on a CCD cam-
era. We record an intensity pattern with atoms present,
I(x, y)atoms, and a background pattern with no atoms
present, I(x, y)back. To analyze the data, we plot

Our assumption for magnetic sublevel distribution
means
the extracted temperatures are upper
bounds, but one would expect the mj = 1 level to be less
populated. Due to the smaller magnetic moment, the
trapping eﬃciency for mj = 1 atoms decreases substan-
tially as the MOT temperature increases, dropping by
about a factor of 5 for a MOT temperature of 12 mK com-
pared to only a factor of two for mj = 2 atoms. Atoms
with mj = 1 can also be lost from the trap through spin-
exchange collisions, which are typically rapid in ultracold
gases. Calculated rates for spin exchange collisions for al-
kali atoms in magnetic traps are typically 10−11 cm3/s,
although they can approach 10−10 cm3/s [? ].

We have assumed thermal equilibrium in our analysis,
but this is reasonable. Thermal equilibration would need
to occur on less than a few hundred ms timescale. Using
a recently calculated s-wave elastic scattering length for
3P2 atoms of a = 6 nm [? ], the collision rate for identical
atoms is nv8πa2 ≈ 9 s−1 for n = 1010 cm−3 and v =

2kBT /M = 1 m/s (T = 3 mK).

The most interesting parameter obtained from the ﬁts
is the temperature, which is plotted in Fig. 5 as a function
of MOT atom temperature. The values are signiﬁcantly
colder than what one would expect from a simple theory
developed in [? ] and plotted in the ﬁgure. The expected
temperature is determined by assuming the kinetic en-
ergy and density distribution in the MOT are preserved
as atoms decay to the metastable state. The 3P2 po-
tential energy distribution is then given by the magnetic

MOT conditions. We conﬁrmed these measurements by
determining the 3P2 atom temperature from ballistic ex-
pansion velocities, as is done to measure the MOT tem-
perature.

As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the temperature de-
creases with decreasing trap depth as would be expected
for evaporative cooling of the sample [? ]. For this data,
the magnetic trap depth is held constant during the en-
tire load and hold time. Conﬁrmation of this explanation
could be achieved with measurement of the collision cross
section and thermalization rate in the trap. We plan on
pursuing these experiments.

If evaporative cooling is working eﬃciently, it should be
possible to use radio-frequency-induced forced evapora-
tive cooling to further cool the sample and increase the
density. Majorana spin-ﬂips [? ]
from trapped to un-
trapped magnetic sublevels at the zero of the quadrupole
magnetic ﬁeld will eventually limit the sample lifetime,
but it will still be 10 s at 100 uK. For studies of quan-
tum degeneracy, the sample would have to be transferred
to a magnetic trap without a ﬁeld zero or to an optical
dipole trap. Straightforward improvement of our vac-
uum should yield atom numbers and densities an order
of magnitude higher than currently attained, and allow
us to fully explore potential gains through evaporative
cooling.

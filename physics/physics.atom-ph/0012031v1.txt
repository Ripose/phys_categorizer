Using a high-frequency ﬁeld superposed to a linearly po-
larized bichromatic laser ﬁeld composed by a wave with fre-
quency ω and a wave with frequency 2ω, we show it is pos-
sible to enhance the intensity of a group of high harmonics
in orders of magnitude. These harmonics have frequencies
about 30% higher than the monochromatic-cutoﬀ frequency,
and, within the three-step-model framework, correspond to
a set of electron trajectories for which tunneling ionization
is strongly suppressed. The observed enhancement suggests
that the high-frequency ﬁeld provides an additional mech-
anism for the electron to reach the continuum. The addi-
tional high frequency ﬁeld permits the control of this group
of harmonics leaving all other sets of harmonics practically un-
changed, which is an advantage over schemes involving only
bichromatic ﬁelds.

Within the last few years, the perspective of obtaining
eﬃcient laser sources in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
regime has led to the proposal of several schemes for con-
trolling the harmonic spectrum of an atom subject to a
strong laser ﬁeld (I ∼ 1014W/cm2), using for instance
additional static ﬁelds [1], ultrashort pulses [2], bichro-
matic driving ﬁelds [3–6], or additional conﬁning poten-
tials [7]. These schemes are based on the “three-step
model” [8], which describes very well the spectral fea-
tures observed in experiments. These features are the
“plateau”, where harmonics of roughly the same inten-
sities exist, and the “cutoﬀ”, where the harmonic signal
suddenly decreases in orders of magnitude. According
to this model, the generation of high-order harmonics in
strong laser ﬁelds corresponds to a dynamical process in
which an electron leaves an atom at an instant t0 via tun-
neling ionization, this electron in the continuum is then
accelerated by the driving ﬁelds, and, if it comes back
and recombines with the parent ion at a time t1, a high
energy photon will be generated. The harmonic energy
is given by Ω = |ε0| + Ekin(t0, t1), with Ekin(t0, t1) and
|ε0| being, respectively, the kinetic energy of the electron
upon return and the ionization potential of its parent
ion. The cutoﬀ corresponds to the maximum electron
kinetic energy. By manipulating the diﬀerent steps of
the dynamical process, one can in principle control high-
harmonic generation.

If the purpose is to increase the cutoﬀ energy, very eﬃ-
cient schemes exist. They involve either additional static
ﬁelds [1], or atoms placed in conﬁning potentials [7]. In
both cases one introduces an additional force which mod-
iﬁes the propagation of the electron after injection, result-

ing in an increased cutoﬀ energy. However, such schemes
may require extremely high static ﬁelds [9], or appropri-
ate solid-state materials, whose existence is still under
investigation [10].

Another scheme for manipulating high harmonics in-
volves bichromatic driving ﬁelds [3–6]. By varying the
frequencies, the relative phase, and the intensities of the
two driving waves, one can modify the propagation of
the electron in the continuum, and even the “ﬁrst step”,
i.e., the tunneling ionization. The experimental imple-
mentation of this bichromatic scheme should be easier
compared to the previous ones.

In the bichromatic case, however, no simple expres-
sion for the cutoﬀ energy exists [4], such that it is not
straightforward to predict whether the plateau can be ex-
tended. There exist several local maxima for Ekin(t0, t1),
but they do not necessarily correspond to an abrupt in-
tensity decrease in the harmonic signal. A very illustra-
tive example is a bichromatic ﬁeld consisting of a wave
with frequency ω and its second harmonic [4,5]. The ad-
dition of the second driving wave causes a splitting in the
monochromatic-ﬁeld cutoﬀ energy εmax = |ε0| + 3.17Up,
Up being the ponderomotive energy. As a direct conse-
quence, there is a double-plateau structure in the har-
monic spectra, with an upper and a lower cutoﬀ, whose
energies are higher and lower than εmax, respectively.
The upper cutoﬀ corresponds to the absolute maximum
for Ekin(t0, t1). However, it appears in the spectrum only
as a small shoulder due to the relative low harmonic in-
tensity. The lower cutoﬀ, on the other hand, is related to
a decrease of orders of magnitude in the harmonic yield,
being therefore the one eﬀectively measured in experi-
ments (see, e.g., [5,6] for a more complete discussion).
One can explain the intensity diﬀerence in this double-
plateau structure in terms of the width of the eﬀective po-
tential barrier through which the electron tunnels. This
barrier is given by Veﬀ = V (x) − xE(t0), where E(t0)
is the ﬁeld at the electron emisson time and V (x) the
atomic potential. For the upper cutoﬀ, the atomic po-
tential is not as much distorted by the ﬁeld as for the
lower cutoﬀ. This results in a considerably wider ef-
fective potential barrier and, consequently, much weaker
harmonics.

In this paper we consider again the case of a linearly
polarized ω − 2ω ﬁeld, as in [4,5]. However, this time
our aim is to increase the intensities of the upper-cutoﬀ-
harmonics close to the intensities of those belonging the
lower cutoﬀ, eﬀectively extending the cutoﬀ energy be-
yond εmax = |ε0| + 3.17Up. For this purpose, one must

1

provide an additional mechanism for the electronic wave
packet to reach the continuum, thus compensating the
weak tunneling ionization. We demonstrate that this can
be done with an additional driving wave. This third wave
has a relative high frequency but low intensity compared
to the bichromatic ﬁeld. The nature of the third wave
is such that it alters the electron injection into the con-
tinuum and, at the same time, it does not appreciably
modify the ponderomotive energy and the cutoﬀ. This
ﬁeld conﬁguration is similar to that used in [11], where
the inﬂuence of the background ﬁeld on x-ray-atom scat-
tering processes was investigated.

We restrict ourselves to a one-dimensional model,
which still describes high-harmonic generation with lin-
early polarized ﬁelds well in qualitative terms. We solve
the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

cies and the phases with respect to the ﬁrst driving wave,
respectively. In this paper, we choose ω1 = ω, ω2 = 2ω,
E03 ≪ E01, E02 and ω3 ≫ ω. Unless stated otherwise,
the relative phase φ13 is set to zero. The binding poten-
tial is taken as

VG(x) = −α exp(−x2/β2),

which is a widely used expression for modelling short-
range potentials. The harmonic spectra are calculated
from the dipole acceleration ¨x = hψ(t)| − dV (x)/dx +

To ﬁrst approximation, if the third driving wave is much
weaker than the others and its frequency is much higher
than ω, the contribution from the additional ﬁeld to the
ponderomotive energy (5) and to the kinetic energy (4)
can be neglected. More speciﬁcally, for the parameters
used in this paper, we observed, after solving the clas-
sical equations of motion of an electron in a ﬁeld (2),

(4)

that for E03/E02 ≤ 1 and ω3 > 5ω the inﬂuence of the
third driving wave on these two latter quantities was not
signiﬁcant.

As a starting point, we shall discuss the existence of
the enhancement in question. We will restrict ourselves
to varying the relative phase φ12 between the two low-
frequency driving waves and the high-frequency ﬁeld pa-
rameters. The bichromatic ﬁeld strengths are similar to
these in [5], namely E01 = 0.1 a.u., E02 = 0.032 a.u,
which give the intensity ratio I2ω/Iω = 0.1. For these
ﬁeld parameters, the high-harmonic spectrum displays a
clear double-plateau structure, with a lower and an up-
per cutoﬀ (c.f. Fig. 1). The lowest frequency is taken as
ω = 0.057 a.u., which is typically used in experiments.
The ground-state energy was taken as |ε0| = 0.57 a.u.,
which roughly corresponds to the argon ionization poten-
tial and, unless stated otherwise, we took α = 1.15 a.u.
and β = 1 a.u. in (3). This gives a model-atom with a
single bound state.

FIG. 1. Harmonic spectra for an atom subject
to
the three-color ﬁeld (2), with strong-ﬁeld amplitudes
E01 = 0.1 a.u., E02 = 0.032 a.u., high-frequency ﬁeld
strengths 0 ≤ E03 ≤ 0.02 a.u., frequencies ω1 = 0.057 a.u.,
ω2 = 0.114 a.u. and ω3 = 0.57 a.u., and relative phase
φ13 = 0, for φ12 = 0 (part (a)) and φ12 = 0.3π (part (b)).
The lower cutoﬀ (near harmonic order 50) and the upper cut-
oﬀ (near harmonic order 62) are marked with arrows. The
lower-cutoﬀ energy depends more sensitively on φ12 than the
upper-cutoﬀ energy [5].

The inﬂuence of the third driving wave on the har-
monic spectra is shown in Fig. 1, for relative phases

φ12 = 0 and φ12 = 0.3π and several ﬁeld strengths E03.
The relative phase φ13 was set to zero in both cases, and
ω3 was chosen to be ten times ω1. Apart from the strong
enhancement around ω3 (near harmonic order 10), the
main diﬀerences between the case with a third wave and
the bichromatic case (E03 = 0) are displayed in the so-
called “upper-cutoﬀ” harmonics, which lie, for the phases
in question, roughly at εu = |ε0| + 3.8Up, with the cor-
responding harmonic orders near N = 62. The inten-
sity of this group of harmonics can be changed signiﬁ-
cantly when the ﬁeld strength of the third wave is in-
creased. Whereas for φ12 = 0 these changes are quite
irregular, for φ12 = 0.3π they appear as very pronounced
enhancements, which reach three orders of magnitude.
They make the intensities of the upper-cutoﬀ and lower-
cutoﬀ harmonics comparable, eﬀectively extending the
harmonic production region. This occurs already for a
third wave whose intensity is only a few percent of that
of the bichromatic ﬁeld.

A particularly interesting feature of the scheme is that
it aﬀects mainly the group of harmonis in the upper cut-
oﬀ, leaving other groups of harmonics practically unaf-
fected. This is in contrast with the purely bichromatic
case, for which a change in the relative phase φ12 leads to
changes in the whole plateau structure [4,5]. In analysing
the enhancement eﬀects, we recall that the presence of
the high-frequency third wave does not modify the pon-
deromotive energy and the classical trajectories. Thus,
the three-step model leads us to the conclusion that a
high-frequency induced process is injecting the electron
into the continuum. This interpretation is supported by
the diﬀerences between Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). For φ12 = 0,
there is still enough tunneling to compete with the high-
frequency induced process, such that the quantum in-
terference between both processes leads to irregular in-
tensity variations. For φ12 = 0.3π, on the other hand,
tunneling is strongly suppressed, such that the electron
reaches the continuum mainly due to the high-frequency
induced process [5].

In the following we understand how the observed en-
hancements depend on the relative phase φ13, on the
ﬁeld strength E03, on the frequency ω3, and whether the
atomic potential has any inﬂuence on it.

FIG. 2. Harmonic yields as functions of the high-frequency
ﬁeld strength E03, for the same ﬁeld as in Fig.
1, with
φ12 = 0.3π and 0.285 a.u. ≤ ω3 ≤ 0.684 a.u.. The harmonic
orders displayed in the ﬁgure correspond to the most eﬃcient
enhancements obtained.

The behavior with respect to φ13 gives further infor-
mation about the nature of the eﬀect due to the third
wave. We veriﬁed that the upper-cutoﬀ harmonics re-
main unchanged when φ13 is varied. This result rules
out the possibility that the injection can be described
by an eﬀective potential barrier produced by the three
waves together. Rather it suggests that the third wave is
playing a very diﬀerent role than the bichromatic ﬁelds.
Another very important issue is the dependence of the
enhancements on the ﬁeld strength E03. A closer inspec-
tion of Fig. 1(b) suggests that there is a saturation inten-
sity for the upper-cutoﬀ harmonics (in the ﬁgure, close
to E03 = 0.01 a.u.). Furthermore, these harmonics are
unequally enhanced, the maximum enhancement occur-
ring, for the example in question, at the harmonic order
N = 58. This maximum can be slightly displaced, de-
pending on the frequency ω3. In Fig. 2, we show explic-
itly the behavior of this maximally enhanced harmonic
with respect to the ﬁeld strength E03, for several frequen-
cies ω3. This ﬁgure shows that the enhancement eﬀect
increases quickly in the weak ﬁeld region but it even-
tually saturates when reaching the strong ﬁeld region,
which means that upper-cutoﬀ harmonics can not be in-
deﬁnitely enhanced by increasing the strength of the high
frequency wave.

enhancements at the integers can be understood as a con-
sequence of the high-harmonic generation process: since
the production of harmonics takes place within many cy-
cles of the driving ﬁeld, one expects it to be most eﬃcient
when this ﬁeld is periodic. Fig.3 also demonstrates that
the observed enhancements are not related to threshold
eﬀects, since they occur when the frequency of the third
wave is either below or above the threshold.

The investigations presented above are from our nu-
merical calculations for the short-range potential (3),
with α and β chosen in such a way that it has a single
bound state. To rule out the possibility that the eﬀect is
due to an artifact introduced by this model potential, we
performed similar calculations for several potentials with
diﬀerent values for depth α and width β. We also stud-
. We
ied the soft-core potential VC = −α
observed that the enhancements are present in all situa-
tions, being however stronger for short-range potentials.
This is related to the fact that tunneling ionization is
more eﬃciently suppressed in the short-range case, such
that it does not compete with the high-frequency induced
process. For the gaussian potential used, we obtain very
pronounced enhancements for β ≤ 2 a.u., which is well
within the experimental range.

In conclusion, we have shown that, with an additional
high-frequency ﬁeld, we are able to enhance a group of
very high harmonics of a bichromatic driving ﬁeld con-
sisting of a wave of frequency ω and its second harmonic.
These harmonics have energies up to |ε0| + 4Up, which
is about 30% higher than the monochromatic cutoﬀ fre-
quency εmax = |ε0| + 3.17Up. They correspond to a set
of electron trajectories for which tunneling is not very
pronounced in the bichromatic case. The high-frequency
ﬁeld provides an additional mechanism for the electron
to reach the continuum, resulting in the enhancement of
this group of harmonics.

This eﬀect is particularly strong when the relative
phase between the two strong driving waves is chosen
such that tunneling ionization is strongly suppressed.
Such a case is provided by taking φ12 = 0.3π [5], for
which an appreciable enhancement is already obtained
with high-frequency ﬁelds whose intensities are only a few
percent of that of the bichromatic ﬁelds. This phase con-
trol is already experimentally feasible [6]. Another pre-
rrequisite for pronounced enhancement eﬀects concerns
the frequency of the third wave, which must be an inte-
ger multiple of the fundamental frequency of the bichro-
matic ﬁeld. Furthermore, our theoretical studies show
that the enhancements are always present for very diﬀer-
ent potentials, but they also suggest that a short-range
potential gives stronger enhancements and therefore is a
more appropriate choice for a possible experimental con-
sideration.

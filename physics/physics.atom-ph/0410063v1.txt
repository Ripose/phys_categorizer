We consider an oscillator interacting with a massless scalar ﬁeld in the framework of recently
introduced dressed coordinates. We compute all the probabilities associated with the decay process
of an excited level of the oscillator. After establishing some sum rules that relate the probabilities
associated to the diﬀerent decay processes we show that any probability can be computed by using
only two quantities: the probability of the oscillator to remain in the ﬁrst excited level and the
probability of decay by emission of a ﬁeld quantum. Thus, the sum rules allows to show that the
transition probabilities between excited levels follow a binomial distribution.

I. INTRODUCTION

The concept of dressed atom was originally introduced to study a two level atom model [1–3]. It allows nonpertur-
bative understanding of those phenomena, as for example, the resonant eﬀect associated to the coupling of atoms with
strong electromagnetic ﬁelds [4] or atoms placed in intense resonant laser beams [5]. More recently, inspired by these
works, the concept of dressed coordinates [6–8] has been introduced . This concept was introduced in the context
of an harmonic oscillator (the atom) interacting linearly with a massless scalar ﬁeld and allowed the construction of
dressed states, with the physically correct property of stability of the oscillator ground state in the absence of ﬁeld
quanta (the quantum vacuum). It Also allowed for a nonperturbative treatment of the oscillator radiation processes.
Afterwards in Ref. [9] the case of a nonlinear interaction between the oscillator and the ﬁeld modes was treated.

Generally, in spite of the system being linear, if we work with the usual coordinates it is not possible an analytical
computation of the probabilities associated with the oscillator radiation processes. For example, the exact calculation
of the simplest process such as the probability for the oscillator decay from the ﬁrst excited level to the ground state
by emission of a ﬁeld quantum is not possible. However in the framework of dressed coordinates it has been possible
to solve this problem. When applied to an conﬁned atom (approximated by the oscillator) in a spherical cavity of
suﬃciently small radio, the method accounted for, the experimentally observed, inhibition of the decaying processes
[10,11].

Nevertheless, in all previous works [6–8] it was only computed the probabilities associated with the simplest process
just above described. The aim of this paper is to ﬁll this gap. Instead of making this hard task by direct calculations
we proceed ﬁrst by establishing some identities that we named as sum rules and from them we infer the probabilities
associated with the diﬀerent oscillator radiation processes.

The paper is divided as follows. In the section II we review the concept of dressed coordinates and dressed states.
The section III is devoted to the direct computation of the probabilities associated with the decay processes of the
oscillator. In section IV we introduce the sum rules. Finally, in section V we give our concluding remarks. Along this
paper we use natural units c = ¯h = 1.

II. DRESSED STATES

First we introduce the so called dressed coordinates and dressed states, for details see [6–8]. For this purpose we
use as a toy model of an atom-ﬁeld system an oscillator (the atom) interacting linearly with a massless scalar ﬁeld.

Now we are in position to introduce the concept of dressed coordinates and dressed states. We denote the dressed
coordinates as q′
0 is the dressed coordinate associated with the oscillator and q′
k are the dressed coordinates
associated with the ﬁeld modes. We deﬁne the dressed coordinates as the physically meaningful ones and in terms of
them we can deﬁne the dressed states as being

where Γ0(q′) has the same functional form as Γ0(Q) . Thus, the dressed states above are deﬁned as the physically
realizable (and measurable) states and describe in general the physical oscillator in its n0-th excited level and the
nk ﬁeld quanta of frequency ωk. Now, we have to relate the dressed coordinates with the qµ or Qr coordinates. For
this end we use the, experimentally observed, stability of the ground state in absence of ﬁeld quanta (stability of the
vacuum state), we require that the dressed state given by Eq. (7) with quantum numbers n0 = n1 = n2 = .... = 0 be
eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with minimum energy. Thus, the dressed coordinates are deﬁned by the condition
Γ0(q′) = Γ0(Q).
µ and Qr will be linear. In this
way it is easy to show that [6–8],

The other dressed states in Eq. (7) are not energy eigenfunctions and, then, they will not remain stable. For example,
the ﬁrst excited state of the dressed (physical) oscillator, whose eigenfunction is ψ100...(q′), will decay to the ground
state ψ000...(q′).

III. THE DECAY PROCESSES

We are interested mainly in the computation of the probabilities associated with the diﬀerent radiation processes
of an excited state of the oscillator. Thus, wishing to maintain the reasoning as general as it is possible we show
the necessary steps to compute the probability amplitude associated with the most general transition: Let the initial
d, then, we ask what is the probability amplitude of ﬁnding it at
n0, n1, n2, ...
state of the system, at t = 0, given by

m0m1m2...

Above, the wave functions φl0l1l2...(Q) and ψn0n1n2...(q′) are normalized in Q coordinates. The wave function
φl0l1l2...(Q) as given in Eq. (6) is already normalized. On the other hand the dressed wave function ψn0n1n2...(q′) as
given in Eq. (7) is normalized in the q′ coordinates but not in Q coordinates. It is easy to show that if the ground
state Γ0(q′) is normalized in Q coordinates then the dressed states, given by Eq. (7), are also normalized. Therefore,
we assume that it is the case, thus, we can replace Eqs. (6) and (7) in Eq. (10) to get

By setting µ = ν = 0 in Eq. (15) we obtain the probability amplitude for the oscillator to remain at time t in the

n-th excited state, thus, it reads

where we have discarded the phase factor e−itE000... because it does not contribute for the associated probability. Also,
by setting µ = 0 and ν = k we can obtain the probability amplitude of the particle to decay from the n-th excited
level to its ground state by emission of n ﬁeld quanta of frequencies (or energy in ¯h = 1 units) ωk,

IV. SUM RULES

It is clear that if the oscillator is initially in its n-th excited level it can decay of many diﬀerent ways from that
described in Eq. (18). For example it can decay to its ground state by emission of n ﬁeld quanta of diﬀerent frequencies
or it can also decay to other lower excited states by emission of a number of ﬁeld quanta less than n. The probability
amplitudes related to these processes can all be computed by using Eqs. (9) and (11). The task to be made can be
very hard because it would be necessary to compute the integral given in Eq. (11) that involves products of more
than two Hermite polynomials, as it can be noted by substituting Eq. (12) in (11). Therefore, we will avoid this
complication following an alternative way. If the particle oscillator is at time t = 0 in the n-th excited state we expect
that at time t: it remains excited, emit a ﬁeld quantum of frequency ωk1 and go to the (n
1)-th excited level, emit
two ﬁeld quanta of frequencies ωk1 , ωk2 and go to the (n
2)-th excited level, emit three ﬁeld quanta of frequencies
3)-th excited level and so on. We denote the probability amplitudes related with
ωk1 , ωk2, ωk3 and go to the (n

these processes respectively by
(t),
n00...0

i = 1, 2, ...n. The corresponding probabilities are denoted by

be able to get an identity similar to Eq. (19) and from such expression identify the respective probabilities associated
with all the other possible processes.

an identity of the type given by Eq. (19). This identity is what we call in the present paper as sum rules. Other
similar identities can be established for other related processes. Our sum rules are very diﬀerent from the quantum
mechanical sum rules [16] where some identities are established by the only use of the algebra between canonically
conjugates variables. In the present case we used the same name since our sum rules can be established by the only
use of the algebra of the matrix elements that diagonalize our system.

From Eq. (24) we can identify the respective probabilities associated with all the other possible processes, thus, by

As a check, that expression above is a valid expression, we set i = n and k1 = k2 = ... = kn = k in Eq. (26) and we
obtain Eq. (18) which is the probability amplitude to the emission of n ﬁeld quanta of frequencies ωk as it must be.
From Eq. (25) we can also obtain the probability of the dressed oscillator to decay, at the time t, from the n-th to
m) ﬁeld quanta of arbitrary frequencies. We denote this quantity by

the m-th excited level by emission of i = (n

amplitude of emission of a ﬁeld quanta is the same as the probability amplitude of absorption of the ﬁeld quanta. We
have just computed, Eq. (26), the probability amplitudes related to the emission of ﬁeld quanta. Using the crossing
symmetry mentioned we can compute all the probability amplitudes related to the absorption of ﬁeld quanta. The
crossing relation mentioned is diﬀerent from the ﬁeld theoretical crossing relations, where the probabilities are equal
and not the probability amplitudes as it is in the present case. The reason for the occurrence of this in our present
model is because the wave function of an harmonic oscillator is real.

Thus, we have shown that any probability amplitude associated to the radiation processes of an harmonic oscillator
in interaction with a massless scalar ﬁeld can be given in terms only of two quantities: the probability amplitude of
the particle oscillator to remain in the ﬁrst excited level f00(t) and the probability amplitude of the particle oscillator
to decay by emission of a ﬁeld quantum of frequency ωk, f0k(t). We have also shown that the transition probability
from one excited level to another, by emission of arbitrary ﬁeld quanta, is given by a binomial distribution.

Demands from several areas of siene and tehnology have lead to a worldwide searh for aurate

optial loks with an unertainty of 1 part in 1018

, whih is 103

times more aurate than the

present day esium atomi loks based on mirowave frequeny regime. In this artile we disuss

the eletri quadrupole and the hyper(cid:28)ne shifts in the 5s 2S1/2 −→ 4d 2D5/2 lok transition in Sr+

,

one of the most promising andidates for next generation optial loks. We have applied relativisti

88Sr+
oupled luster theory for determining the eletri quadrupole moment of the 4d 2D5/2 state of
and the magneti dipole (A) and eletri quadrupole (B ) hyper(cid:28)ne onstants for the 5s 2S1/2 and
4d 2D5/2 states whih are important in the study of frequeny standards with Sr+

. The e(cid:27)ets of

eletron orrelation whih are very ruial for the aurate determination of these quantities have

been disussed.

1 Introdution

The frequenies at whih atoms emit or absorb eletro-magneti radiation during a transition an be

used for de(cid:28)ning the basi unit of time [1, 2, 3℄. The transitions that are extremely stable, aurately

determine their suitability for optial frequeny standards. In a reent artile [11℄ Gill and Margolis have

measurable and reproduible an serve as exellent frequeny standards [1, 2℄. The urrent frequeny

standard is based on the ground state hyper(cid:28)ne transition in

and has an unertainty of one part in 1015
in the optial regime. The unertainty of these loks is expeted to be about 1 part in 1017

[4℄. However, there is a searh for even more aurate loks

133Cs whih is in the mirowave regime

88Sr+

199Hg+

or 1018
171Yb+

[5℄. Some of the prominent andidates that belong to this ategory are

[6, 7℄,

[8℄,

[9℄,

[10℄,

et. Indeed detailed studies on these ions will have to be arried out in order to

43Ca+

138Ba+

88Sr+

3.4 parts in 1015
to an auray of 1.5 parts in 1015

disussed the merits of hoosing

as a andidate for an optial lok. Till reently, the most aurate

measurement of an optial frequeny was for the lok transition in

whih has an unertainty of

[12℄. However, reently, Oskay et al. [13℄ have measured the optial frequeny of

88Sr+

199Hg+

In this artile we onentrate on strontium ion (Sr+

andidates for an ultra high preision optial lok [11℄. The lok transition in this ase is 5s 2S1/2 −→
4d 2D5/2 and is observed by using the quantum jump tehnique in single trapped strontium ion. When

) whih is onsidered to be one of the leading

and further improvements are expeted [14℄.

an atom interats with an external (cid:28)eld, the standard frequeny may be shifted from the resonant

frequeny. The quality of the frequeny standard depends upon the aurate and preise measurement

of this shift. To minimize or maintain any shift of the lok frequeny, the interation of the atom with

it's surroundings must be ontrolled. Hene, it is important to have a good knowledge of these shifts

so as to minimize them while setting up the frequeny standard. Some of these shifts are the linear

Zeeman shift, quadrati Zeeman shift, seond-order Stark shift, hyper(cid:28)ne shift and eletri quadrupole

shift. The largest soure of unertainty in frequeny shift arises from the eletri quadrupole shift of the

lok transition beause of the interation of atomi eletri quadrupole moment with the gradient of

external eletri (cid:28)eld. In this artile we have applied relativisti oupled-luster (RCC) theory, one of

the most aurate atomi many-body theories to alulate the eletri quadrupole moment (EQM) and

the hyper(cid:28)ne onstants for the energy levels involved in the lok transition.

2 Relativisti oupled-luster theory

The relativisti and dynamial eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets an be inorporated in many-eletron systems

through a variety of many-body methods [15, 16, 17, 18℄. The relativisti oupled luster (RCC) method

has emerged as one of the most powerful and e(cid:27)etive tools for high preision desription of eletron

orrelations in many-eletron systems [17, 18℄. The RCC is an all-order non-perturbative sheme, and

therefore, the higher order eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets an be inorporated more e(cid:30)iently than using the

order-by-order diagrammati many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). RCC is equivalent to all order

relativisti MBPT (RMBPT). The RCC results an therefore be improved by adding the important

omitted diagrams with the aid of low order RMBPT. We have applied RCC theory to alulate atomi

properties for several systems and more details an be obtained from Ref. [19℄.

Here we present a brief outline of RCC theory. We begin with N -eletron Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian

(H ) whih is expressed as

with the Fermi vauum desribed by the four omponent Dira-Fok (DF) state |Φi. The normal ordered

Following Lindgren's formulation of open-shell CC [20℄, we express the valene universal wave operator

and σ being the exitation operator and urly brakets denote the normal ordering. The wave operator
Ω ating on the DF referene state gives the exat orrelated state. The operator σ has two parts, one
orresponding to the ore and the other to the valene setor denoted by T and S respetively. In the

singles and double (SD) exitation approximation the exitation operator for the ore setor is given by

The exat open shell referene state is ahieved by using the tehniques of eletron attahment. In order

For omputational simpliity we store only the one-body matrix element of O = exp(T †)O exp(T ). O
may be expressed in terms of unontrated single-partile lines [21℄. The fully ontrated part of O will

not ontribute as it annot be linked with the remaining part of the numerator of the above equation.

First few terms of Eq.(10) an be identi(cid:28)ed as O , OS1 and OS2 whih we identify as dressed Dira-

Fok (DDF), dressed pair-orrelation (DPC) and dressed ore-polarization (DCP) respetively. The other

2OS1 and S†
terms are being identi(cid:28)ed as , S†
2OS2 and are lassi(cid:28)ed as higher order e(cid:27)ets.
We use the term `dressed' to desribe the modi(cid:28)ation of the operator O due to ore-ore orrelation
e(cid:27)ets. In Fig. 2 we replae the operator O by the dressed operator O (the dressed quadrupole/hyper(cid:28)ne

1OS1 . Here 2(a) and 2(b+) represent the DPC and DCP e(cid:27)ets

respetively. 2(b) is known as the diret and 2() is the exhange DPC diagram. Figure 2(d) refers to

one of the higher order pair orrelation e(cid:27)et whih belongs to the set, termed as `others'.

3 Eletri quadrupole shift

The largest soure of systemati frequeny shift for the lok transition in Sr+
quadrupole shift of the 4d 2D5/2 state aused by its eletri quadrupole moment of that state and the

arises from the eletri

3

interation of the external eletri (cid:28)eld gradient present at the position of the ion. The eletri quadrupole

moment in the state 4d 2D5/2 was measured experimentally by Barwood et al. at NPL [22℄. Sine
the ground state 5s 2S1/2 does not possess any eletri quadrupole moment, the ontribution to the
quadrupole shift for the lok frequeny omes only from the 4d 2D5/2 state.

The interation of the atomi quadrupole moment with the external eletri-(cid:28)eld gradient is analogous

to the interation of a nulear quadrupole moment with the eletri (cid:28)elds generated by the atomi

eletrons inside the nuleus. In the presene of the eletri (cid:28)eld, this gives rise to an energy shift by

oupling with the gradient of the eletri (cid:28)eld. Thus the treatment of eletri quadrupole moment is

analogous to its nulear ounterpart. The quadrupole moment Θ of an atomi state |Ψ(γ, J, M )i is
de(cid:28)ned as the diagonal matrix element of the quadrupole operator with the maximum value MJ , given

by

Θ = hΨ(γJJ)| Θzz |Ψ(γJJ)i .

Here γ is an additional quantum number whih distinguishes the initial and (cid:28)nal states. The eletri

quadrupole operator in terms of the eletroni oordinates is given by

e
2 Xj (cid:0)
where the sum is over all the eletrons and z is the oordinate of the j th eletron. To alulate the

More details about evaluation of eletri quadrupole moment using RCC theory is desribed in our reent

paper [23℄. The eletri quadrupole shift is evaluated using the relation

take the prinipal-axis frame of the eletri (cid:28)eld gradient to the quantization axis and ǫ is an asymmetry

4 Hyper(cid:28)ne shift

The frequeny standard is based on the

, the odd isotope

has also

88Sr isotope. In addition to

88Sr+

87Sr+

been proposed as a possible andidate for an optial frequeny standard [25℄. An experiment has been

performed in NPL to measure the hyper(cid:28)ne struture of the 4d 2D5/2 state in

87Sr+

[25℄. Theoretial

determination of hyper(cid:28)ne onstants is one of most stringent tests of auray of the atomi wave

funtions near the nuleus. Also aurate preditions of hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstants require a preise

inorporation of relativisti and orrelation e(cid:27)ets.

Unlike the even isotope (

2 ) and the
2D5/2 states are independent of the (cid:28)rst order Zeeman shift. Here,
mF = 0 levels for both the
in table 2 we present the results of our alulation of the magneti dipole (A) hyper(cid:28)ne onstant for the
5s 2S1/2 and 4d 2D5/2 states and the eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne onstant (B ) for the 4d 2D5/2 state

87Sr+

[26℄.

Hhf s =

where M (k)
are spherial tensors of rank k , whih orresponds to nulear and eletroni parts
of the interation respetively. The lowest k = 0 order represents the interation of the eletron with the

In the (cid:28)rst order perturbation theory, the energy orresponding to the hyper(cid:28)ne interation of the

4.1 Magneti dipole hyper(cid:28)ne onstant

Hyper(cid:28)ne e(cid:27)ets arise due to the interation between the various moments of the nuleus and the

eletrons of an atom. Nulear spin gives rise to a nulear magneti dipole moment whih interats with

the eletrons and thus gives rise to magneti dipole hyper(cid:28)ne interation de(cid:28)ned by the magneti dipole

hyper(cid:28)ne onstant A. For an eigen state |IJi of the Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian, A is de(cid:28)ned as

4.2 Eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne onstant

The seond order term in the hyper(cid:28)ne interation is the eletri quadrupole part. The eletri quadrupole

hyper(cid:28)ne onstant is de(cid:28)ned by putting k = 2 in Eq. (17). The nulear quadrupole moment is de(cid:28)ned

5 Results and disussions

The oupied and the virtual orbitals used in the alulation are obtained by solving the Dira-Fok

(DF) equation for Sr++

for a (cid:28)nite Fermi nulear distribution. These orbitals are linear ombinations

of Gaussian type funtions on a grid [28℄. The open shell oupled luster (OSCC) method is used to

onstrut di(cid:27)erent single valene states whose referene states orrespond to adding a partile to the

losed shell referene state. We use the singles-doubles and partial triples approximation, abbreviated

as CCSD(T) and exitations from all the ore orbitals have been onsidered. We have estimated the

error inurred in our present work, by taking the di(cid:27)erene between our RCC alulations with singles,

doubles as well as the most important triple exitations (CCSD(T)) and only single and double exitations

(CCSD).

5.1 Eletri quadrupole moment

We present our results of the eletri quadrupole moment for the 4d 2D5/2 state of
The value of Θ in the 4d 2D5/2 state measured experimentally is (2.6 ± 0.3)ea2
value for the 4d 2D5/2 strethed state is (2.94 ± 0.07)ea2

Bohr radius. We analysed our results and have found that the DDF ontribution is the largest. The

leading ontribution to eletron orrelation omes from the DPC e(cid:27)ets and the DCP e(cid:27)ets are an order

of magnitude smaller. This an be understood from the DPC diagram (Fig.2(a)) whih has a valene

eletron in the 4d5/2 state. Hene the dominant ontribution to the eletri quadrupole moment arises
from the overlap between virtual d5/2 orbitals and the valene, owing to the fat that S1 is an operator
of rank 0 and the eletri quadrupole matrix elements for the valene 4d5/2 and the di(cid:27)use virtual d5/2

orbitals are substantial. On the other hand, in the DCP diagram (Fig.2(b+)), the matrix element of

the same operator ould also involve the less di(cid:27)use s or p orbitals. Hene, for a property like the eletri

quadrupole moment, whose magnitude depends on the square of the radial distane from the nuleus,

this trend seems reasonable, whereas for properties like hyper(cid:28)ne interation whih is sensitive to the

near nulear region, the trend is just the opposite for the d states [29℄. As expeted, the ontribution
of the DHOPC e(cid:27)et i.e., S†
¯OS1 (Fig.2(d)) is relatively important as it involves an eletri quadrupole
1
matrix element between the valene 4d5/2 and a virtual d5/2 orbital.

by one of the authors using relativisti e(cid:27)etive valene shell Hamiltonian method [34℄. Information on

A for the 4d 2D5/2 state is very important in onnetion with optial frequeny standards [12, 25℄. The
measured value of this quantity is 2.1743 ± 0.0014 MHz [25℄, whereas the previously alulated values
vary from 1.07 MHz [31℄ and 2.507 MHz [35℄. Our alulated value of A is 2.16 ± 0.02 MHz; this is the
most aurate theoretial determination of A for the 4d 2D5/2 state to date. For the 5s 2S1/2 state our
alulated value of A is 997.26 ± 0.03 MHz. To analyze the result we fous on the various many-body
e(cid:27)ets ontributing to the alulation of A. The most important many-body diagrams are presented
in Fig. 2. We have notied that for 5s 2S1/2 state the dominant ontribution is at the DDF level
∼ 72%. However, for the 4d 2D5/2 state the DCP e(cid:27)et is larger and its sign is opposite that of the

DDF ontribution. In their alulations Martensson [31℄ and Yu et al.

[35℄ have found similar trends.

We have seen that the higher order orrelation e(cid:27)ets ontribute signi(cid:28)antly in determining A for this

state - olletively they are 60% of the total value but opposite in sign. In the earlier alulations the

determination of the higher order e(cid:27)ets was not as aurate as ours.

The alulated value for the eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne onstant (B ) for the 4d 2D5/2 state is
47.8 ± 0.2 MHz whih deviates ∼ 2.7% from the entral experimental value. The earlier determination
of B was o(cid:27) by ∼ 11% from the experiment. Sine the other state involved in the lok transition is

spherially symmetri the eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne onstant is zero and there will be no hyper(cid:28)ne

shift due to B for the 5s 2S1/2 state.

From the (cid:28)gure presented in Fig. 2 it is lear that the DPC e(cid:27)et involves the hyper(cid:28)ne interation

element beomes

of a valene eletron and the residual Coulomb interation, i.e for 5s 2S1/2 state the hyper(cid:28)ne matrix
, where q an be any virtual orbital and hhf s is the single-
partile hyper(cid:28)ne operator. Sine only s1/2 and p1/2 eletrons have a sizable density in the nulear
(cid:11)
region, the DPC e(cid:27)et is dominant for 5s1/2 state but not for the 4d5/2 state. On the other hand, the

[4p6]5s1/2 |hhf s| [4p6]q
(cid:10)

DCP e(cid:27)ets represent the hyper(cid:28)ne interation of a polarized ore eletron with any virtual eletron

(see Fig. 2b,). For 4d5/2 state it is lear that the hyper(cid:28)ne matrix element for the DPC e(cid:27)et is muh
smaller than the DCP e(cid:27)et, whih plays the most important role in determining the value of A. The

ore polarization ontribution is so large for this state that it even dominates over the DDF ontribution.

6 Conlusion

In onlusion, we have performed an ab initio alulation of the eletri quadrupole moment for the

4d 2D5/2 state of

88Sr+

to an auray of less than 2.5% using the RCC theory. This is the (cid:28)rst appliation

of RCC theory to determine the eletri quadrupole moment (EQM) of any atom and is urrently the

most aurate determination of EQM for the 4d 2D5/2 state in Sr+
dipole (A) hyper(cid:28)ne onstant for the 5s 2S1/2 and 4d 2D5/2 states and eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne
onstant (B ) for the 4d 2D5/2 state of

87Sr+

. Evaluation of orrelation e(cid:27)ets to all orders as well as the

. We have also alulated the magneti

inlusion of the dominant triple exitations in our alulation was ruial in ahieving this auray. The

magnitude of eletri quadrupole moment depends on the square of the radial distane from the nuleus,

whereas properties like hyper(cid:28)ne interation are sensitive to the near nulear region. The aurate

determination of quantities like eletri quadrupole moment and hyper(cid:28)ne onstants establish the fat

that RCC is very powerful and e(cid:30)ient method for determining atomi properties near the nulear region

as well as at large distanes from the nuleus. Our result will lead to a better quantitative understanding

of the eletri quadrupole shift of the resonane frequeny of the lok transition in Sr+

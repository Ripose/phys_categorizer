A classical Over Barrier Model to compute charge exchange between ions and

one–optical–electron atoms

In this paper we study theoretically the process of electron capture between one–optical–electron
atoms (e.g. hydrogenlike or alkali atoms) and ions at low-to-medium impact velocities (v/ve ≤
1) working on a modiﬁcation of an already developed classical Over Barrier Model (OBM) [V.
Ostrovsky, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 28 3901 (1995)], which allows to give a semianalytical
formula for the cross sections. The model is discussed and then applied to a number of test cases
including experimental data as well as data coming from other sophisticated numerical simulations.
It is found that the accuracy of the model, with the suggested corrections and applied to quite
diﬀerent situations, is rather high.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electron capture process in collisions of slow, highly charged ions with neutral atoms and
molecules is of great importance not only in basic atomic physics but also in applied ﬁelds such as
fusion plasmas and astrophysics. The process under study can be written as:

A+q + B → A(q−j)+ + Bj+ .

(1)

Theoretical models are regularly developed and/or improved to solve (1) from ﬁrst principles for
a variety of choices of target A and the projectile B, and their predictions are compared with the
results of ever more reﬁned experiments.
In principle, one could compute all the quantities of interest by writing the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for the system (1) and programming a computer to solve it. This task can be
performed on present–days supercomputers for moderately complicated systems. Notwithstanding
this, simple approximate models are still valuable: (i) they allow to get analytical estimates which
are easy to adapt to particular cases; (ii) allow to get physical insight on the features of the problem
by looking at the analytical formulas; (iii) ﬁnally, they can be the only tools available when the
complexity of the problem overcomes the capabilities of the computers. For this reason new models
are being still developed [1–3].

The present author has presented in a recent paper [3] a study attempting to develop a more
accurate OBM by adding some quantal features. The model so developed was therefore called a
semi–classical OBM. Its results showed somewhat an improvement with respect to other OBMs, but
not a dramatic one.
In this paper we aim to present an OBM for dealing with one of the simplest processes (1): that
between an ion and a target provided with a single active electron. Unlike the former one [3], this
model is entirely developed within the framework of a classical model, previously studied in [1] (see
also [4]), but with some important amendments and improvements which, as we shall see, allow a
quite good accordance with experiments.

The paper is organized as follows: a ﬁrst version of the model is presented and discussed in section
II. In section III we will test our model against a ﬁrst test case. From the comparison a further
improvement to the model is proposed (section IV) and tested against the same case, as well as
other data in section V. It will be shown that predictions with this correction are in much better
agreement.

II. THE MODEL: FIRST PICTURE

We consider the standard scattering experiment and label T, P, and e respectively the target ion,
the projectile and the electron. The system T + e is the initial neutral atom. Let r be the electron
vector relative to T and R the internuclear vector between T and P. In the spirit of classical OBM
models, all particles are considered as classical objects.
Let us consider the plane P containing all the three particles and use cylindrical polar coordinates
(ρ, z, φ) to describe the position of the electron within this plane. We can arbitrarily choose to set
the angle φ = 0, and assign the z axis to the direction along the internuclear axis.
The total energy of the electron is (atomic units will be used unless otherwise stated):

E =

p2
2

+ U =

p2
2 −

Zt

pρ2 + z2 −

pρ2 + (R − z)2

Zp

.

Zp and Zt are the eﬀective charge of the projectile and of the target seen by the electron, respectively.
Notice that we are considering hydrogenlike approximations for both the target and the projectile.
We assigne an eﬀective charge Zt = 1 to the target and an eﬀective quantum number n to label the
binding energy of the electron:En = Z2

t /2n2 = 1/2n2.

As long as the electron is bound to T, we can also approximate E as

E(R) = −En −

Zp
R

.

This expression is used throughout all calculations in (I); however, we notice that it is asimptotically
correct as long as as R → ∞. In the limit of small R, instead, E(R) must converge to a ﬁnite limit:

E(R) → (Zp + 1)2En

(united atom limit). For the moment we will assume that R is suﬃciently large so that eq . (3)
holds, but later we will consider the limit (4), too.

On the plane P we can draw a section of the equipotential surface

U (z, ρ, R) = −En −

Zp
R

.

This represents the limit of the region classically allowed to the electron. When R → ∞ this region
is divided into two disconnected circles centered around each of the two nuclei. Initial conditions
determine which of the two regions actually the electron lives in. As R diminishes there can be
eventually an instant where the two regions become connected. In ﬁg. 1 we give an example for
this.
In the spirit of OBMs it is the opening of the equipotential curve between P and T which leads to a
leakage of electrons from one nucleus to another, and therefore to charge exchange. We make here
the no-return hypothesis: once crossed the barrier, the electron does not return to the target. It is
well justiﬁed if Zp >> 1. As we shall see just below, this hypothesis has important consequences.

It is easy to solve eq. (5) for R by imposing a vanishing width of the opening (ρm = 0); further-

more, by imposing also that there be an unique solution for z in the range 0 < z < R:

Rm =

(1 +pZp)2 − Zp

En

.

In the region of the opening the potential U has a saddle structure: along the internuclear axis it
has a maximum at

while this is a minimum along the orthogonal direction.

z = z0 = R

1

pZp + 1

Charge exchange occurs provided the electron is able to cross this potential barrier. Let NΩ be
the fraction of trajectories which lead to electron loss at the time t. It is clear from the discussion
above that it must be function of the solid opening angle angle Ω, whose projection on the plane is
the ±θm angle. The exact expression for NΩ will be given below. Further, be W (t) the probability
for the electron to be still bound to the target, always at time t. Its rate of change is given by

dW (t) = −NΩdt

with Tem the period of the electron motion along its orbit.
It is important to discuss the factor dt(2/Tem) since it is an important diﬀerence with (I), where
just half of this value was used. The meaning of this factor is to account for the fraction of electrons
which, within the time interval [t, t + dt] reach and cross the potential saddle. In (I) it was guessed
that it should be equal to dt/Tem, on the basis of an uniform distribution of the classical phases
of the electrons. However, let us read again what the rhs of eq. (8) does mean:
it says that the
probability of loss is given by the total number of available electrons within the loss cone (W (t)×NΩ),
multiplied by the fraction of electrons which reach the potential saddle. However, on the basis of
the no–return hypothesis, only outgoing electrons can contribute to this term: an electron which
is within the loss cone and is returning to the target from the projectile is not allowed, it should
already have been captured and therefore would not be in the set W . It is clear, therefore, that the
eﬀective period is Tem/2, corresponding to the outgoing part of the trajectory.

A simple integration yields the leakage probability

Pl = P (+∞) = 1 − W (+∞) =
2

= 1 − exp(cid:18)−

Tem Z +tm

−tm

NΩdt(cid:19) .

In order to actually integrate Eq. (9) we need to know the collision trajectory; an unperturbed
straight line with b impact parameter is assumed:

The extrema ±tm in the integral (9) are the maximal values of t at which charge exchange can
occur. If we identify this instant with the birth of the opening, using eq. (6) and (10), we ﬁnd

R =pb2 + (vt)2

.

tm =

√R2
m − b2
v

.

At this point it is necessary to give an explicit expression for NΩ. To this end, we will consider
ﬁrst the case of an electron with zero angular momentum (l = 0), and then will extend to nonzero
values.

In absence of the projectile, the classical electron trajectories, with zero angular momentum, are
ellipses squeezed onto the target nucleus. We are thus considering an electron moving essentially in
one dimension. Its hamiltonian can be written as

The electron has a turning point at

p2
2 −

r

= −En

.

rc =

1
En

.

Obviously the approaching of the projectile modiﬁes these trajectories. However, in order to make
computations feasible, we make the following hypothesis: electron trajectories are considered as
essentially unperturbed in the region between the target and the saddle point. The only trajectories
which are thus allowed to escape are those whose aphelia are directed towards the opening within
the solid angle whose projection on the P plane is ±θm (see ﬁg. 1) provided that the turning point of
the electron is greater than the saddle-point distance: rc ≥ z0. The validity of these approximations
can be questionable, particularly if we are studying the collision with highly–charged ions, which
could deeply aﬀect the electron trajectory. We limit to observe that it is necessary in order to make
analytical calculations. A posteriori, we shall check the amount of error introduced by such an
approximation.

The angular integration is now easily done, supposing a uniform distribution for the directions of

the electrons:

NΩ =

(1 − cos θm)

.

In order to give an expression for θm we notice that cos θm = z0/(ρ2

(15)

It is easy to recognize that, in the right-hand side, the ﬁrst term is the potential due to the electron–
target interaction, and the second is the electron–projectile contribution. Eq. (15) cannot be solved
analytically for ρm except for the particular case Zp = 1, for which case:

ρ2

m =(cid:18) 2

E(R)(cid:19)2

2(cid:19)2
−(cid:18) R

.

The form of E(R) function of R cannot be given analytically, even though can be quite easily
computed numerically [6]. In order to deal with expressions amenable to algebraic manipulations,
we do therefore the approximation: ﬁrst of all, divide the space in the two regions R < Ru, R > Ru,
where Ru is the internuclear distance at which the energy given by eq. (3) becomes comparable
with its united–atom form:

En +

Zp
Ru

= (Zp + 1)2En → Ru =

Zp

(Zp + 1)2 − 1

.

We use then for E(R) the united–atom form for R < Ru, and the asymptotic form otherwise:

E(R) = En +

Zp

,

R > Ru

= (Zp + 1)2En, R < Ru

It is worthwhile explicitly rewriting eq. (16) for the two cases:

and the corresponding expressions for NΩ are:

NΩ =

1 − cos θm

(3 − EnR), R > Ru
(1 − EnR), R < Ru

.

Note that NΩ = 1/2 for R = 0. This is a check on the correctness of the model, since, for sym-
metrical scattering at low velocity and small distances we expect the electrons to be equally shared
between the two nuclei.

When Zp > 1 we have to consider two distinct limits: when R → ∞ we know that eventually
ρm → 0 (eq. 6). It is reasonable therefore to expand (15) in series of powers of ρm/R and, retaining
only terms up to second order:

ρ2
m ≈

2pZp
(cid:0)pZp + 1(cid:1)4 R2(cid:20)(cid:16)pZp + 1(cid:17)2

− Zp − EnR(cid:21)

.

Consistently with the limit R → ∞, we have used the large–R expression for E(R).
The limit R → 0 is quite delicate to deal with: a straightforward solution of eq. (15) would give

ρm ≈

1

(Zp + 1)En

+ O(R)

,

but calculating cos θm and eventually NΩ from this expression gives wrong results: it is easy to work
out the result NΩ = 1/2, R → 0. This is wrong because, obviously, the limit NΩ → 1, Zp → ∞
must hold. The reason of the failure lies in the coupling of eq. (15) with the united–atom form for
E(R): one can notice that the expression thus written is perfectly simmetrical with respect to the
interchange projectile–target. Because of this symmetry, electrons are forced to be equally shared
between the two nuclei. This is good when dealing with symmetrical collisions, Zp = Zt = 1, and
is actually an improvement with respect to (I), where eq. (21) was used even for small R’s and one
recovered the erroneous value NΩ(R = 0) = 3/8. But when Zp > 1 the asymmetry must be retained
in the equations. The only way we have to do this is to extend eq. (21) to small R, obtaining

1 − cos θm ≈ pZp

(pZp + 1)2 h(pZp + 1)2 − Zp − EnRi

.

It is straightforward to evaluate eq. (23) in the limit Zp → ∞, R → 0, and ﬁnd the sought result, 2.
We notice that, from the numerical point of view, it is not a great error using eq. (21) everywhere:
the approximation it is based upon breaks down when R is of the order of Ru or lesser, which is
quite a small range with respect to all other lengths involved when Zp > 1, while even for the case
Zp = 1 it is easy to recover (see equations below) that the relative error thus introduced on Pl is
∆Pl/Pl = 1/24 for small b (and–obviously–it is exactly null for large b). Therefore, eq. (21) could
be used safely in all situations. However, we think that the rigorous altough quite lengthy derivation
given above was needed since it is not satisfactory working with a model which does not comply
with the very basic requirements required by the symmetries of the problem at hand.

We have now to take into account that the maximum escursion for the electron is ﬁnite. If we put
rc = z0 and use for z0, rc respectively the expressions given by (7) and (13), we obtain an equation
which can be easily solved for R:

R = R′

m = (pZp + 1)rc

.

The R′
m thus computed is the maximum internuclear distance at which charge exchange is allowed
under the present assumptions. Since R′
m < Rm (compare the previous result with that of eq. 6 )
we have to reduce accordingly the limits in the integration in eq. (9): it must be performed between

The cross section can be ﬁnally obtained after integrating over the impact parameter (this last

Again, we have used the fact that the range of interaction is ﬁnite: the maximum allowable impact
parameter bm is set equal to R′

Finally, we consider the case when the angular momentum is diﬀerent from zero. Now, orbits are
ellipses whose minor semiaxis has ﬁnite length. We can still write the hamiltonian as function of
just (r, p):

and R′

Now the fraction of trajectories entering the loss cone is much more diﬃcult to estimate.

In
it is equal to the fraction of ellipses which have intersection
principle, it can still be determined:
with the opening. Actual computations can be rather cumbersome. Thus, we use the following
approximation, which holds for low angular momenta l << n (with n principal quantum number):
ellipses are approximated as straight lines (as for the l = 0 case), but their turning point is correctly
estimated using eq. (30). Note that also the period is modiﬁed: its correct expression is

III. A TEST CASE

(31)

As a ﬁrst test case we consider the inelastic scattering Na+ + Na(28d, 29s). We investigate this
sytem since: (i) it has been studied experimentally in [7]; (ii) some numerical simulations using the
Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method have also been done on it [8], allowing to have
detailed informations about the capture probability Pl function of the impact parameter, and not
simply integrated cross sections; (iii) ﬁnally, it has been used as test case in (I), thus allowing to
assess the relative quality of the ﬁts.

In ﬁg. (2) we plot the normalized cross section ˜σ = σ/n4 versus the normalized impact velocity
˜v = vn for both collisions nl = 28d and nl = 29s (solid line). The two curves are very close to each
other, reﬂecting the fact that the two orbits have very similar properties: the energies of the two
states diﬀer by a very small amount, and in both cases EnL2 << 1. The two curves show reversed
with respect to experiment: σ(28d) it is greater than σ(29s). The reason is that the parameter rc
is larger in the former case than in the latter.
We can distinguish three regions: the ﬁrst is at reduced velocity around 0.2, where a steep increase
of cross section appears while going towards lower velocities. Over–barrier models do not appear to
fully account for this trend: they have a behaviour at low speed which is ruled approximately by
the 1/v law, consequence of the straight-line impact trajectory approximation:
it is well possible
that this approximation too becomes unadequate in this region.
The second region covers roughly the range 0.3 ÷ 1.0. Here the nl = 29s data are rather well
simulated while the present model overestimates the data for nl = 28d. The bad agreement for nl =
28d was already clear to Ostrovsky which attributed it to a deﬁciency of the model to modelize l-
changing processes. It seems clear that neither our treatment of the angular momentum is suﬃcient
to cure this defect.

Finally, there is the region at ˜v > 1, where again the OBM, as it stands, is not able to correctly
reproduce the data. The reason for this discrepancy can be traced back to the ﬁnite velocity of
the electron: the classical electron velocity is ve = 1/n, so ˜v can be given the meaning of the ratio
between the projectile and the electron velocity. When ˜v ≥ 1 the projectile is less eﬀective at
collecting electrons in its outgoing part of the trajectory (i.e. when it has gone beyond the point of
closest approach). In simple terms: an electron is slower than the projectile; when it is left behind,
it cannot any longer reach and cross the potential barrier.

IV. CORRECTIONS TO THE MODEL

This picture suggests a straightforward remedy: a term must be inserted in eq. (8) to account for
the diminished capture eﬃciency. This is accomplished formally through rewriting NΩ → w(t, ˜v)NΩ,
with w ≤ 1. We have put into evidence that w can in principle be function of time and of the impact
velocity. The simplest correction is made by assuming a perfect eﬃciency for ˜v < 1, w(t, ˜v < 1) = 1,
while, for ˜v > 1, no electrons can be collected after that the distance of minimum approach has
been reached: w+ ≡ w(t > 0, ˜v > 1) = 0. This can appear too strong an assumption, since those
electrons which are by the same side of the projectile with respect to the nucleus, and which are
close to their turning point may still be captured. In ﬁg. (2) we can compare the original data with
those for w+ = 0 (dashed line). The sharp variation of σ at ˜v = 1 is obviously a consequence of the
crude approximations done choosing w which has a step–like behaviour with v.

To get further insight, we plot in ﬁg. 3 the quantity bPl(b) versus b for the collision Na+ +Na(28d).
The impact velocity is ˜v = 1. The symbols are the CTMC results of ref. [8]. Solid line is the model

6

result for w+ = 1; dotted line, the result for w+ = 0; dashed line, an intermediate situation, with
w+ = 1/2. Striking features are, for all curves, the nearly perfect accordance of the value b ≈ 3000
at which Pl = 0 (it is bm according to our deﬁnition). The behaviour at small b’s (Pl ≈ 1/2) is well
reproduced for w+ = 1 while it is slightly underestimated by the two other curves. On the other
hands, only by setting w+ = 0 it is possible to avoid the gross overestimate of Pl near its maximum.
It is thus evident that the agreement is somewhat improved in the region ˜v ≈ 1 by letting
w+ = 0. However, the high–velocity behaviour is still missed by the model, which predicts a power–
law behaviour σ ∝ v−1, while the actual exponent is higher. Within our picture, this suggests
that also the capture eﬃciency w− = w(t < 0) must be a decreasing function of ˜v. An accurate
modelization of the processes which aﬀect this term is diﬃcult, and we were not able to provide it.
However, some semi–qualitative arguments can be given. Let us review again the process of capture
as described in section II and shown in ﬁg. (1): if ˜v > 1, an electron at time t can be in the loss
cone and still not to be lost, since within a time span ∆t ≈ ρm/v the position of the loss cone has
shifted of such an amount that only those electrons which were closer to the saddle point than a
distance ve∆t could be caught. The fraction of these electrons is ∆t(2/Tem) ≈ ρm(2/vTem). This
correction gives an additional 1/v dependence, thus now σ ≈ 1/v2.
As an exercise, we try to ﬁt experimental data using w as a free parameter instead that a function
to be determined by ﬁrst principles. We choose one of the simplest functional forms:

w =

1 + |β|m
1 + |˜v − β|m ,

with β, m free parameters to be adjusted. This form gives the two correct limits: w → 1, ˜v → 0,
and w → 0, ˜v → ∞. The parameter β is not really needed; it has been added to reach a better
ﬁt. Its meaning is that of a treshold velocity, at which the capture eﬃciency begins to diminish.
In ﬁg. (2) we plot the ﬁt obtained with β = 0.2, m = 4 (dotted line): this is not meant to be the
best ﬁt, just a choice of parameters which gives a very good agreement with data. We see that the
suggested corrections are still not enough to give the right power–law, if one needs to go to some
extent beyond the region ˜v = 1.

V. OTHER COMPARISONS

A. Iodine - Cesium collisions

We apply now our model to the process of electron capture
Iq+ + Cs → I(q−1)+ + Cs+

with q = 6 ÷ 30. This scattering process has been studied experimentally in [9]. It is particularly
interesting to study in this context since it has revealed untractable by a number of other OBM’s,
including that of (I) (for a discussion and results, see [3]). The impact energy is chosen equal to
1.5 × Zp keV: since it corresponds to ˜v << 1, we can safely assume w = 1. The Cesium atom is in
its ground state with the optical electron in a s state.
In this case the ﬁt is
In ﬁg. 4 we plot the experimental points together with our estimates.
excellent.
It is important to notice that this agreement is entirely consequence of our choice of
limiting integration to R given by eq. (24): to understand this point, observe that because of the
very high charge of the projectile, the exponential term in eq. (25) is small (F , by direct inspection,
is increasing with Zp) and thus Pl ≈ 1. The details of the model which are in F are therefore of no
relevance. The only surviving parameter, and that which determines σ, is R′
m. It can be checked by
directly comparing our ﬁg. 4 with ﬁg. 1 of ref. [3], where results from model (I) are shown, which
diﬀer from ours just in replacing eq. (24) with eq. (6). There, the disagreement is severe.

B. Ion - Na(n = 3) collisions

As a ﬁnal test case we present the results for collisions H–Na(3s,3p). They are part of a set of
experiments as well as numerical simulations involving also other singly–charged ions: He, Ne, and
Ar (see [11] and the references therein and in particular [12]; ref. [13] presents numerical calculations
for the same system). In ﬁg. 5 we plot the results of our model together with those of ref. [11].
Again, we ﬁnd that only by neglecting w+ some accordance is found. The low–energy wing of the

7

(32)

(33)

curve is strongly underestimated for Na(3s), while the agreement is somewhat better for Na(3p).
Again, the slope of σ for relative velocities higher than 1 could not be reproduced.
We do not show results for other ions: they can be found in ﬁg. 3 of ref. [11]. What is important
to note is that diﬀerencies of a factor two (and even larger for 3s states) appear between light (H+,
He+) and heavy (Ne+, Ar+) ions which our model is unable to predict. We can reasonably conclude
therefore: (i) that the present model is not satisfactory for v/ve << 1 (it was already pointed out
in sec. IV) and for v/ve > 1 ; (ii) the structure of the projectile must be incorporated into the
model otherwise diﬀerent ions with the same charge should cause the same eﬀect, at odds with
experiments. As emphasized in [11,12] the energy defect ∆E of the process is a crucial parameter:
captures to states with ∆E ≈ 0 are strongly preferred. Obviously, the value of ∆E depends on the
energy levels structure of the recombining ion.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have developed in this paper a classical OBM for single charge exchange between ions and
atoms. The accuracy of the model has been tested against three cases, with results going from
moderate–to–good (sec. III and IV), excellent (sec. V.A), and poor–to–moderate (sec. V.B). As a
rule of thumb, the model can be stated to be very well suited for collisions involving highly charged
ions at low velocities.
The model is based upon a previous work [1], and adds to it a number of features, which we go
to recall and discuss: (i) the ﬁnite excursion from the nucleus permitted to the electrons; (ii) the
redeﬁnition of the fraction of lost electrons dt/Tem → dt(2/Tem); (iii) a more accurate treatment of
the small impact parameter region for symmetrical collisions; (iv) the explicit-altough still somewhat
approximate-treatment of the capture from l > 0 states; (v) a correction to the capture probability
due ﬁnite impact velocity. Let us discuss brieﬂy each of these points:
Point (i) and (ii) contribute a major correction: in particular, (i) is essential to recover that excellent
agreement found in section V.A, while (ii) accounts for the correct bPl behaviour at small b’s (see
ﬁg. 2).
Point (iii) is unimportant for actual computations, but corrects an inconsistency of the model.
Point (iv) has been studied in less detail, in part for the lack of experimental data on which doing
comparisons.
Point (v): a good theoretical estimate of w should be of the outmost importance for developing a
really accurate model of collision at medium-to-high impact velocity. In this paper we have just
attempted a step towards this direction which, however, has allowed to recover deﬁnitely better
results.
Finally we recall from sec. V.B that the treatment of the projectile–or better the process of the
electron-projectile binding–is an aspect which probably awaits for main improvements. We just
observe that it is a shortcoming of all classical methods, that they cannot easily deal with quantized
energy levels.

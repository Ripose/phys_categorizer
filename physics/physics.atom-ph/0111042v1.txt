On the Stability of Excited Atoms in Small Cavities

We consider a system consisting of an atom in the approxi-
mation of a harmonic oscillator of frequency ¯ω, coupled to the
scalar potential inside a spherical reﬂecting cavity of radius
R. We use dressed states introduced in a previous publica-
tion [13], which allow a non-perturbative uniﬁed description
of the atom radiation process, in both cases, of a ﬁnite or
an arbitrarily large cavity. We perform a study of the en-
ergy distribution in a small cavity, with the initial condition
that the atom is in the ﬁrst excited state and we conclude
for the quasi-stability of the excited atom. For instance, for
a frequency ¯ω of the order ¯ω ∼ 4.00 × 1014/s (in the visible
red), starting from the initial condition that the atom is in
the ﬁrst excited level, we ﬁnd that for a cavity with diameter
2R ∼ 1.0 × 10−6m, the probability that the atom be at any
time still in the ﬁrst excited level, will be of the order of 97%.
For a typical microwave frequency ¯ω ∼ 2, 00 × 1010/s we ﬁnd
stability in the ﬁrst excited state also of the order of 97% for a
−2m. PACS number(s): 03.65.Ca,
cavity radius R ∼ 1.4 × 10

There are situations in the domain of Atomic Physics,
Cavity Electrodynamics and Quantum Optics, where
perturbation methods are of little usefulness,
for in-
stance, in resonant eﬀects associated to the coupling of
atoms with strong radiofrequency ﬁelds [1]. The the-
oretical understanding of these eﬀects on perturbative
grounds requires the calculation of very high-order terms
in perturbation series, what makes the standard Feyn-
man diagrams technique practically unreliable in those
cases [1]. The trials of treating non-perturbativelly such
kind of systems, have lead to the idea of dressed atom,
introduced in refs [2] and [3]. Since then this concept has
been used to investigate several situations involving the
interaction of atoms and electromagnetic ﬁelds ( [4], [5],
[6]). The core of theoretical diﬃculties is the non-linear
character of the problem, which implies, as noted above,
in very hard mathematical problems to be dealt with. A
way to circumvect these mathematical diﬃculties, is to
assume that under certain conditions the coupled atom-
electromagnetic ﬁeld system may be approximated by the
system composed of an harmonic oscillator coupled lin-
early to the ﬁeld trough some eﬀective coupling constant
g. This is the case in the context of the general QED lin-
ear response theory, where the electric dipole interaction
gives the leading contribution to the radiation process (
[7], [8], [9]), [14].

We consider a system composed of an atom (approxi-
mated by a harmonic oscillator) coupled linearly to the
scalar potential, the whole system being conﬁned in-

side a reﬂecting sphere of radius R. We give a non-
perturbative treatment to the ﬁeld-atom system intro-
ducing some dressed coordinates that allow to divide the
coupled system into two parts, the dressed atom and
the dressed ﬁeld, what makes unnecessary to work di-
rectly with the concepts of bare atom, bare ﬁeld and
interaction between them. For instance, to describe the
radiation process, having as initial condition that only
the mechanical oscillator (the atom), q0 be excited, the
usual procedure is to consider the interaction term in the
Hamiltonian written in terms of q0 and the ﬁeld modes
qi as a perturbation, which induces transitions among
the eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian. In this way it
is possible to treat approximately the problem having as
initial condition that only the bare mechanical oscilla-
tor (the atom) be excited. But as is well known this
initial condition is physically not consistent in reason of
the divergence of the bare oscillator frequency, due to the
interaction with the ﬁeld. The traditional way to circum-
vect this diﬃculty is by the renormalization procedure,
introducing perturbativelly order by order corrections to
the oscillator frequency. In this paper we adopt an al-
ternative procedure introduced in [13]. We do not make
explicit use of the concepts of interacting bare oscilla-
tor and ﬁeld, described by the coordinates q0 and
.

We introduce dressed coordinates q′
for, respec-
tively the dressed atom and the dressed ﬁeld modes. In
terms of these new coordinates a non-perturbative ap-
proach of the radiation process and of the distribution of
energy inside the cavity is possible.

We start considering an atom approximated by a har-

below a renormalized frequency ¯ω which is physically
meaningfull) coupled linearly to the scalar potential φ,
the whole system being conﬁned in a sphere of radius
R centered at the oscillator position. The equations of

We consider for a moment as in [13], the problem of
a harmonic oscillator q0 coupled to N other oscillators.
In the limit N
we recover our original situation
of the coupling oscillator-ﬁeld after redeﬁnition of diver-
gent quantities, in a manner analogous as renormaliza-
tion is done in ﬁeld theories.
In the above equations,
g is a coupling constant (with dimension of frequency),
η = √2g∆ω and ∆ω = πc/R is the interval between two
ωi = ∆ω = πc/R
neighbouring ﬁeld frequencies, ωi+1 −
and qi stands for the harmonic modes of the ﬁeld. The
Hamiltonian (3) can be turned to principal axis by means
of a point transformation, qµ = tr
µPr, per-
formed by an orthonormal matrix T = (tr
µ), µ = (0, k),
k = 1, 2, ... N , r = 0, ...N . The subscript 0 and k re-
fer respectively to the atom and the harmonic modes
of the ﬁeld and r refers to the normal modes. The
transformed Hamiltonian in principal axis reads, H =

tion modes of the coupled system. The eigenfrequencies

The N +1 solutions Ωr of Eq.(4), correspond to the N +1

It can be shown [13] that if ω2

only positive solutions for Ω2 (all collective modes are
harmonic), while if ω2
0 < N η2, Eq.(4) has a negative so-
lution Ω2

mode that does not allows stationary conﬁgurations. We
will not care about this last situation. Nevertheless it
should be remarked that in a diﬀerent context, it is pre-
cisely this negative squared frequency solution (runaway
solution) that is related to the existence of a bound state
in the Lee-Friedrechs model. This solution is considered
in ref. [15] in the framework of a model to describe quali-
tatively the existence of bound states in particle physics.

where the subscripts µ = 0, i refer respectively to the

behaviour of the system with the initial condition that
only one dressed oscillator q′
µ (the dressed atom or one
of the modes of the dressed ﬁeld) be in the N -th excited
state. We will study in detail the particular case N = 1,
which will be enough to have a clear understanding of
our approach. Let us call Γµ
1 the conﬁguration in which
only the dressed oscillator q′
µ is in the ﬁrst excited level.
We have from Eqs.(13 ), (11) (14) and (8) the following
expression for the time evolution of the ﬁrst-level excited
dressed oscillator q′

¿From Eq.(15) we see that the initially excited dressed os-
cillator naturally distributes its energy among itself and
all other dressed oscillators as time goes on, with proba-
bility amplitudes given by Eq.(16). If the dressed oscilla-
tor q′
0 (the atom) is in its ﬁrst excited state at t = 0, its
decay rate may evaluated from the time evolution equa-
tion,

In Eq.(17) the coeﬃcients f 0ν(t) have a simple interpre-
tation: f 00(t) and f 0i(t) are respectively the probability
amplitudes that at time t the dressed atom still be ex-
cited or have radiated a photon of frequency ωi. We see

that this formalism allows a quite natural description of
the radiation process as a simple exact time evolution of
the system. We consider in the following the time evolu-
tion of the excited atom, in the cases of a very large and
a very small cavity.

a) A very large cavity
In the case of a very large cavity our method general-
izes what can be obtained from perturbation theory. The
probability that the atom be still excited at time t can
be obtained in continuous language from the amplitude

where ˜¯ω =

proximation t >> 1
¯ω plays a role only in the two last
terms, due to diﬃculties to evaluate exactly the inte-
gral in Eq. (18) along the imaginary axis using Cauchy’s
theorem. The ﬁrst term comes from the residue at
Ω = ˜¯ω + i πg
2 and would be the same if we have done
an exact calculation. If we consider in eq. (19) g << ¯ω,
which corresponds in electromagnetic theory to the fact
that the ﬁne structure constant α is small compared to
unity (for explicit calculations we take below g/¯ω = α),
we obtain the well known perturbative exponential decay
law.

b) A very small cavity
Let us now consider the atom placed at the center of
a very small cavity, i.e. that satisﬁes the condition that
its radius be much smaller than the coherence lenght,
R << c/g. To obtain the eigenfrequencies spectrum, we
remark that from a numerical analysis of Eq.(5) it can
be seen that in the case of a small cavity radius R, its
solutions are near the frequency values corresponding to
the asymptots of the curve cot( RΩ
c ), which correspond to
the ﬁeld modes ωi = iπc/R. The smallest solution de-
parts more from the ﬁrst asymptot than the other larger
solutions depart from their respective nearest asymptot.
As we take larger and larger solutions, they are nearer
and nearer to the values corresponding to the asymp-
tots. For instance, for a cavity radius R of the order of
10−2m and ¯ω
1010/s, only the lowest eigenfrequency
Ω0 is signicantly diﬀerent from the ﬁeld frequency cor-
responding to the ﬁrst asymptot, all the other eigenfre-
quencies Ωk, k = 1, 2, ... being very close to the ﬁeld
modes kπc/R. For higher values of ¯ω (and lower values

the ﬁeld modes frequencies are still smaller.

order to avoid spurious singularities due to our approxi-
mation.

Thus to solve Eq.(5) for the larger eigenfrequencies we

Let us consider the situation where the dressed atom
is initially in its ﬁrst excited level. Then from Eq.(16) we
obtain the probability that it will still be excited after a
ellapsed time t,

But since for a small cavity every ǫk is much smaller than
1, Eq.(21) may be linearized in ǫk, giving,

Ω0R/c << 1 (we will see below that this condition is
compatible with the condition of a small cavity as deﬁned
above). Inserting the condition Ω0R/c << 1 in Eq.(5)
and keeping up to quadratic terms in Ω the solution for
the lowest eigenfrequency Ω0 can be writen,

We have used in this paper a formalism that allows
an uniﬁed approach to the radiation process by an atom,
in rather diﬀerent situations, as the atom conﬁned in
a very small cavity or in free space. The behaviour of
atoms conﬁned in small cavities is completelly diﬀerent
from the behaviour of an atom in free space or in a large
cavity. In the ﬁrst case the emission process is very sen-
sitive to the presence of boundaries, a fact that has been
pointed out since a long time ago in the literature ( [19],
[20], [21]). Our dressed states approach gives an uni-
ﬁed description for the dressing of the atom by the ﬁeld
modes and the emission process in a cavity of arbitrary
size, which includes microcavities and very large cavities
(free space emission). We recover here with our formal-
ism the experimental observation that excited states of
atoms in suﬃciently small cavities are stable. We are
able to give formulas for the probability of an atom to
remain excited for an inﬁnitely long time, provided it is
placed in a cavity of appropriate size. For an emission
frequency in the visible red, the size of such cavity is in
good agreement with experimental observations ( [17],
[18]). Also, our approach gives results in good agree-
ment with previous theoretical results for the emission in
free space, generalizing the well known exponential decay
law. Moreover the detailed behaviours which we obtain
with our formalism are very diﬀerent in the two situa-
tions: The atom in a very large cavity has a probability
decay rate weekly oscillating and monotonically varying
with time (the probability that the atom be excited de-
creases almost exponentially with increasing time).
In
the case of an excited atom placed in the center of a very
small cavity, the probability that it remains excited as
time goes on oscillates very rapidly with time and never
departs signiﬁcantly from the situation of stability of the
atom in the excited state.

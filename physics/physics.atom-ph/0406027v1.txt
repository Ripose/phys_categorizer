The calculations of the elastic scattering properties of ultracold-francium isotopes are reported in
the detail. A parametric model potential for the triplet molecular states of the Fr2 is represented, and
the scattering lengths at and the eﬀective range re are calculated using WKB and Numerov methods
for Fr-Fr in the triplet state. The convergence of these scattering properties as the depending on

INTRODUCTION

In the Bose-Einstein condensation of alkali metal
atoms, about francium atom has been known very little
knowledge except trapping and cooling until now [1]. Be-
cause it has too much energy coming from nuclear reac-
tion and no stable long-lived isotopes. Ultracold atomic
collisions gained renew an important have came out a ne-
cessity of research as result of the atomic trapping and
cooling when energy levels, hyperﬁne structure intervals
and isotopes shifts for Fr isotopes is intensely studied in
detailed[2, 3]. Calculations of ultracold elastic scattering
properties for this atom haven’t been seen in literature
until now. Reason of this is that experimental work on
Fr has been lacking mostly due to no stable long-lived
isotope[4, 5]. Collisions of alkali metal atoms except Fr
atom at a few mill degrees Kelvin temperatures have been
studied recently in many experiments [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
Theoretical work about scattering on Fr has been scant
and only a few published papers exist[12].

The character of the interaction between atoms in low-
) and magnitude
temperatures is determined by signs (
of the scattering length a:
for bosonic and fermionic
atoms with a > 0 Bose condensate is stable, for a <
0 it is unstable[13]. The Pauli Exclusion Principle
(which was determined experimentally) states that no
two fermion particles can occupy the same state at the
same time. They must have some way of being distin-
guished, whether by location, spin state, or some other
property. That means that if one fermion is in a local
ground or minimum energy state, the next fermion in
the area must be in a higher energy state. For bosons,
however, the Pauli Exclusion Principle is irrelevant by
deﬁnition – so all of the bosons can be in the same state
at the same time. They don’t have to be distinguishable
from each other. When this happens, a Bose-Einstein
Condensate is stable. Accurate calculations of s-wave

scattering length and eﬀective range for diatomic poten-
tials are important due to the elastic collisions in these
temperatures dominated by s-wave or low wave scatter-
ing. The accurate determination of scattering length de-
pends on choosing the interaction potentials. Collision
processes at near- zero temperatures (
µK) are sensi-
tive to the details of the interaction potentials between
the colliding systems.

∼

In this paper, we have calculated scattering lengths a,
eﬀective ranges re and cross section for collisions of Fr-Fr
isotopes at ultracold temperatures with the semiclassi-
cal method (WKB)[14] and also solved the Schr¨odinger
equation using Numerov method numerically[15]. The
+
interaction of francium isotopes in triplet (3
u ) is de-
scribed by short and long range potentials. This inter-
action potential V (r ) for Fr atom was parametered by
using coeﬃcients found in the literature. These calcu-
lated scattering properties using this potential are com-
pared for two methods. We investigated the convergence
of some scattering properties obtained with help of these
methods as the dependence of the core radius and a K 0
parameter using Quantum Defect Theory[16] and the an-
alytic calculations of the scattering lengths obtained by
Szmytkowski[17].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

given by

A. Potential

−

≡

The interaction between Fr atoms like the other al-
kali metal atoms has two features: First, the potential
at large distances behave as an inverse power of the in-
κ/rn with n = 6 for spher-
teratomic distance, υ =
ically symmetric two atoms in their ground state. The
asymptotic parameter κ
c6 is known quite well for most
atomic pairs of interest. Second, for alkali metal atoms
other than hydrogen and helium the potential curve is
generally quite deep and also the electron-exchange part
of the atomic interaction is repulsive at smaller distance
as for the singlet and triplet terms of alkali- metal atoms.
“Deep” here means that the wave functions of the atomic
pair oscillate many times within the potential well, even
at very low collision energies. The interatomic potential
supports a large number of vibration levels. This latter
feature enables one to use the semiclassical approxima-
tion to describe the motion of Fr atoms within potential
well [21].

Alkali-metal atoms have uncompensated electron spin
s = 1/2 in the ground state. Therefore, the interaction
between two alkali atoms in the ground state results in
the formation of a diatomic molecule, which is described
by two terms corresponding to the total spin sab = sa+sb
of the system equals to 1 or 0. The state with sab = 0
and 1 corresponds to the singlet state and triplet state,
respectively. The probability of the spin exchange is de-
termined by both the dependence of potential curves on
the internuclear distance r and the splitting between sin-
glet and triplet terms. The exchange interaction is ana-
lytically calculated using the surface integral method by
Smirnov and Chibisov[22], which yields

Also we have obtained the value of normalization con-
stant, A by joining in the range of distances from the
nucleus the wave function y(r), obtained by the Hartree-
Fock method, and the asymptotic value of the wave func-
tion of Eq. (2) for an electron far from the nucleus but
in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the atomic core. For Fr-Fr, these
values of constants are given in Table I.

As shown in the Table II, the scattering lengths calcu-
lated for the collisions of Francium pairs is in excellently
agreement for two method.

Even our results shows that the stability of large
condensates requires repulsive interactions (positive a),
whereas for attractive interactions (negative a) it is un-
stable, only a ﬁnite number of atoms can be found in
condensate state in a trap. Due to changes in the V(r),
scattering length is found as negative value, which lead to
a condensate triplet state where the number of atoms is
limited to a small critical value determined by the mag-
nitude of a .
In contrast, we have observed the posi-
tive scattering lengths that produce stable condensates
The calculations given in Table II shows that all atoms
are found in the same energy levels If interaction atom
species are boson, or they display a adopt behavior due to
Pauli exclusion principle If interaction atom species are
fermion. Also, from scattering lengths given as a func-
tion of the semiclassical phase shift in the eq. (4), we say
that the minor changes in phase shifts have strongly af-
fected the scattering amplitude. It is also remarked that
for 212Fr-212Fr, the analysis in the direct determination
of scattering length is weakly dependent on the number
Nb of bound states supported by ab-initio potential. In
contrast, mass scalling from one isotope to the others
depends more strongly on Nb.

As shown in table II scattering lengths are unstable
against collapse from isotope 208Fr-208Fr to 211Fr-211Fr.
Here the both boson-boson and fermion-fermion interac-
tions are unstable. Same case is valid for the other stable
isotope interactions.

Also, the eﬀective ranges calculated using Numerov
and WKB methods in the function of phase for the V (r)
potentials are presented in Table IV. The close agree-
ment between the calculations of re from Eqs.(8) and
(11) conﬁrms the accuracy of the numerical integration
of the partial-wave equation. The size of the scattering
lengths and eﬀective ranges is closely related to the po-
sition of the last vibration bound states of the energy
curves, as can be anticipation by inspection of Eq.(3)
and number of vibrational levels ns(ϕ/π) which, consis-
tent with Levinson’s theorem, show that as the binding

4

energy of the highest level tends to zero, the scattering
length tends to

inﬁnity[24].

C. Convergenge of scattering length and eﬀective
range

Analytical calculations of scattering lengths are im-
portant in investigation of convergence of the scattering
length and the eﬀective range. In many approaches used
to solve collision problems in atomic physics, the tree di-
mensional conﬁguration space is divided into two regions
separated by a spherical shell (a core boundary) of radius
ρ. In the inner region (r < ρ) the short-range interaction
between two colliding particles is very complicated and
a scattering equation must be solved independently for
each combination of particles. In contrast, it ρ is chosen
suﬃciently large the scattering problems in the outer re-
gion (r > ρ) may be reduced to potential scattering with
the long-range potential accurately approximated by sim-
ple analytical expression. A numerical solution in this
region is usually easily approachable[25]. Two of these
methods are analytical calculations derived by Radoslaw
Szmytkowski for inverse problems[25] and Quantum De-
fect Theory described by Gao[16].

Radoslaw Szmytkowski solved the radial schr¨odinger
equation at zero energy for inverse type of long-range in-
teraction analytically with solutions expressed in terms
of the Bessel, Whittaker and Legendre functions, respec-
tively. They derive exact analytical converge formulae
for the scattering lengths. The expressions depend on the
short-range scattering length, core radius and parameters
characterizing the long-range part of the interaction. In
Table V, We obtained the convergence of the ultra cold
scattering length of Francium atom using the formulae of
Szmytkowski. These formulae are given in that paper as
eqs. (75), (73). As shown in the table, this method con-
ﬁrms convergence of the scattering length for 212Fr-212Fr.
Here, only, the convergence of the scattering length calcu-
lated from WKB method is given, and the same behavior
can also be seen in the numerical calculation.

Quantum defect theory of atomic collisions is presented
by Gao. Based on the exact solutions of the Schr¨odinger
equation for an attractive 1/r6 potential, the theory
provides a systematic interpretation of molecular bound
states and atom-atom scattering properties and estab-
lishes the relationship between them. He ﬁnds a deﬁni-
tion for the scattering length and the eﬀective range and
s wave at zero energy as

where β6 = (2µ C6)4 and K 0is the analytic function of

Figure 2 shows the scattering length and the eﬀective
range curve plotted using the eqs. (15) and ones(dotted
points) obtained by the mean WKB formulas.

Our graphical representations show that as K 0 goes
inﬁnity, the QDT results converges excellently to values
obtained by WKB method in Fig. 2. Even, it may be
said that the diﬀerent calculation of these properties gives
similar results for any ultracold atom-atom collision in
these two method.

It is also known in more tex book that the low energy
scattering is always dominated by the l = 0 partial wave

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The elastic scattering properties for the collision of the

francium atoms in a limited range of moment (k < ¯a−1
≈
0.01a.u. for francium-francium isotopes) at low tempera-
tures are sensitive to the details of interaction potentials.
Scattering properties such as scattering length, eﬀective
range and cross section have been computed using semi-
classical and a numeric methods for the V (r) potentials
as dependence of cutoﬀ radius adjusted by comparing

with the experimental potential for ultra-cold francium-
francium isotopes collision. We investigated the conver-
gence of these scattering properties as the depending of
core radius and K 0 parameter using Quantum Defect
Theory and analytical calculations derived by Radoslaw
Szmytkowski for inverse problems. Cross section was ob-
10−15m2 at low energy. The phase shifts, an
tained as
intermission parameter for scattering length and eﬀective
range, has linear manner at small momenta k < ¯a−1.

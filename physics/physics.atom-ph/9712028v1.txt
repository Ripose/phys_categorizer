It was earlier reported [PRL 78 199, (1997)] that long-lived excited states of positronium can be
formed in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds at laboratory ﬁeld strengths. Unlike the lower-lying
states that are localized in the magnetically distorted Coulomb well, these long-lived states which can
possess a lifetime up to many years are localized in an outer potential well that is formed for certain
values of the pseudomomentum and magnetic ﬁeld. The present work extends the original analysis
and studies the dependence of the spectrum as a function of ﬁeld strength and pseudomomentum
over a wide range of parameters. We predict that in the limit of large pseudomomentum, the ground
state of positronium atom in a magnetic ﬁeld will become delocalized; for strong ﬁelds, the binding
energy of this state is quite large, resulting in a ground state that is both stable against direct
annihilation and against ionization by low frequency background radiation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of treating the two-body system in a magnetic ﬁeld has a long history [1–9]. Early on it was realized
that the center of mass motion cannot be separated from the internal motion. The motional electric ﬁeld due to
the collective motion of the system in the magnetic ﬁeld gives rise to a Stark term in the Hamiltonian which is very
similar to that arising from an external electric ﬁeld. Hence, both problems can be treated in a uniﬁed way.

2 B

When the center of mass eﬀects are treated correctly, the total momentum of the system P is not a conserved
quantity and a separation of the center of mass and internal motion is impossible. The pseudomomentum K =
P + e
r is however a conserved quantity, where P is the total momentum and r is the relative vector of the two
e [10]. For neutral systems, one can carry out a pseudoseparation of the
oppositely charged particles with charges
center of mass and internal motion, where the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the internal motion includes K-dependent
terms, where K is the eigenvalue of the pseudomomentum [10,11]. Recently, it was shown that one can account for the
eﬀect of the motion of the center of mass on the internal motion via an eﬀective potential that is gauge independent
[12]. This potential gives rise to an outer well for certain values of K and B, which leads to delocalized states. There
have been several studies of the eﬀects of a signiﬁcant Stark term on the strong ﬁeld behavior of one-electron atoms
[13–15].

±

Recently, the gauge-invariant potential was extended to the case of positronium, where rigorous numerical results
indicated that for ﬁeld strengths attainable in the laboratory, one could form delocalized states of positronium [16].
The probability density within an interparticle distance radius of hundreds of Angstroms is less than 10−16, indicating
that the rates for direct annihilation and radiative decay to lower lying states localized in the Coulomb well are near
zero. The existence of such delocalized states for positronium is important because it provides a mechanism for
creating a stable bound state of a particle-antiparticle pair.

In this paper, we attempt a more thorough investigation of the problem.

Our previous work established the existence of such a state at values of K and B that are attainable in the
laboratory.
In section II, we describe
the potential surface of positronium (Ps) as a function of K for values of the magnetic ﬁeld from laboratory ﬁeld
strengths (10−5
10−4a.u.) up to superstrong ﬁelds (10-100 a.u.). We discuss qualitatively the eﬀect of this potential
on the energy spectrum. We present numerical results for select values of the parameters K and B and show that
for large values of the pseudomomentum the ground state of Ps becomes a delocalized state. This is an important
result because it means that any Ps formed under the proper conditions will be stable against annihilation. In the
conclusion, we speculate on how one may obtain evidence of long-lived Ps in a laboratory.

It is important to note that the ionization threshold I, which is the zero point energy of the free particles in the
presence of the ﬁelds, is diﬀerent in the two cases. In a pure magnetic ﬁeld I = B. In crossed ﬁelds, the ionization
threshold includes the energy due to the drift motion I = B + K′
d. The ionization threshold is shifted by
the same amount as the energy levels. The external electric ﬁeld can be used to control the value of the eﬀective
pseudomomentum K′ experimentally. For any combination of E and K that leaves the eﬀective pseudomomentum
K′ unchanged, the ionization energy I

is a constant.

Without loss of generality, we choose B = B ˆz, E = 0, and K = K ˆy. Components of K parallel to B shift the

We now discuss the potential surface, the ground state, and energy spectrum for a ﬁxed B as a function of K. We
will hereafter refer to the potential well that includes the origin as the magnetically distorted Coulomb well (MDCW).
The additional well that forms on the negative x
axis will be referred to as the outer well (OW). The ionization
threshold for positronium is given by the ﬁeld strength I = B. All numerical results were obtained by applying the
adaptive 3D ﬁnite element method (FEM) [17] to the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for the Hamiltonian given
in Eq. (1).

The ﬁeld dependent term in the Hamiltonian is positive deﬁnite and thus the energy eigenvalues of the ﬁeld free
Hamiltonian are increased by the non-zero B ﬁeld. For the ground state, this eﬀect is oﬀset by the increase in the
ionization threshold: the binding energy of the ground state increases with increasing B ﬁeld (see Table 1). For high
lying states, the eﬀect of the additional conﬁnement perpendicular to the ﬁeld is more pronounced and Rydberg states
of the ﬁeld free problem may be pushed into the continuum by the ﬁeld.

The energy levels in the MDCW can be obtained by applying well-known scaling relations to the hydrogenic results

in the inﬁnite mass approximation which are available in the literature [18–20]. From the results ˜

As K is increased monotonically from 0 up to the critical value, we analyze the eﬀect of the two K-dependent terms
in the potential for a ﬁxed B. The term K 2/4 shifts the entire potential curve upward by a constant amount. The
asymmetric term BKx

destroys the azimuthal symmetry for any K > 0 and further distorts the shape of the well.

The combined eﬀect of both terms leads to a decrease in the binding energy of the ground state for ﬁxed B with
increasing K (see Table 1). Second order perturbation theory can be used to calculate the energy shift of the ground
state when both B and K are small. The average interparticle distance

for large B, where K < Kc does not imply small K (see Table I).

For high lying states, the asymmetry of the well becomes even more important resulting in greater decentering
of the probability density than what is observed for the ground state. Because of the competing eﬀects of the two
K-dependent terms, it is impossible to predict the net eﬀect on the energy levels near the ionization threshold. A full
3D solution of the Schr¨odinger equation is required for each set of parameters.

1. General features of the potential

If we now allow K to further increase above the critical value, we observe the formation of the OW, which is
separated from the MDCW by the saddle. The outer well minimum is denoted Vo = V (xo, 0, 0) and the height of the
saddle is Vs = V (xs, 0, 0). For ﬁxed B, we observe the following general features of the potential:

Vs as a function of K at the same ﬁeld strengths as Fig. 2; the point of coalesence is the value of the potential at

Despite the similarity of the potential for diﬀerent values of B (see Fig. 1,3) the energy spectrum of the system -
including the ground state - is dramatically diﬀerent depending on the value of B. The bound states of the system
depend not just on the potential, but also on the ionization threshold I.

When the two wells are distinct, that is, the saddle point energy is well above the ionization threshold, the bound
states can be classiﬁed as OW states or MDCW states: their probability density is concentrated solely in one well.
The bound states of the OW are called delocalized states because the average interparticle separation is large. The

4

overlap between an OW state and a MDCW state is essentially zero. All of the states that are localized in the
MDCW are pushed upward in energy with increasing K and into the continuum; the number of MDCW bound states
decreases. The number of bound states in the outer well increases with increasing K.

However, before we reach the regime where the problem reduces to two separate wells, there is a range of K for
which the saddle point energy is less than the ionization threshold. If the energy of a state is considerably less than
Vs, the state will be concentrated in the OW or the MDCW with very little probability in the barrier region and the
above classiﬁcation scheme for states is still valid. However, if the energy of a state is close to Vs, the distinction
between an OW state and an MDCW states becomes murky. (It is important to remember that Vs is the potential
direction only; the ionization threshold I = B as well as the energy of the state are quantities
maximum in the x
that depend on the 3D wavefunction.) Under these very special conditions,
Vs < B, we have a third kind of
state: the saddle state.

E ≈

−

2. Saddle states

In the regime K > Kc, but Vs < I, an interesting phenomena can occur: a MDCW state can undergo a continuous
transformation into an OW state with increasing K as the energy of the MDCW state approaches Vs. The MDCW
state (see Fig. 4a) will begin to leak into the classically forbidden barrier region (see Fig. 4b). The amount of
tunneling through the barrier increases with increasing K, until a saddle state forms, which has probability density
in the MDCW, the barrier region and the OW (see Fig. 4c). At even higher K, more and more probability density is
transfered from the MDCW to the OW (see Fig. 4d). Since the barrier height is increasing, the energy of the state
is eventually less than Vs and the state is fully delocalized in the OW (see Fig. 4e). The range of K over which this
process occurs can vary orders of magnitude depending on the relative values of I, Vs and
as a function of K (see
Table 1).

E

For low magnetic ﬁelds, the gap between the ionization threshold and the saddle point energy is already small at
the critical value; hence, the formation of saddle states is limited to a very small range of K. For B = 10−4, the
critical value is Kc = 0.1105 and saddle point reaches the ionization threshold (Vs = I) at K = 0.1414. Saddle states
can only form over a range ∆K
.03. Many bound states still exist in the MDCW when the saddle point reaches
the ionization threshold. In contrast, for high magnetic ﬁelds, the separation between the ionization threshold and
the saddle point energy is orders of magnitude greater than what it is at low ﬁelds. For B = 1, the critical value is
Kc = 2.381 and the saddle point reaches the ionization threshold at K = 3.800. Saddle states can form over a range
∆K

1.4. The ground state energy of the system is itself a saddle state in this range.

≈

Once the saddle point reaches the ionization threshold for a ﬁxed B, saddle states can not be formed and all of the
MDCW states are pushed into the continuum with increasing K; the OW spectrum is continuously changing with
increasing K.

≈

3. Fate of the ground state

It is clear that this process of pushing MDCW states out of the well and into the continuum or into the OW
continues until the MDCW spectrum is depleted of bound states. The fate of the MDCW ground state is quite
diﬀerent for low B ﬁelds than for high B ﬁelds. At low ﬁelds, there is a sudden transition at which the ground state
energy of the OW drops below the ground state of the MDCW. Both states are well below the saddle point energy,
which is much greater than the ionization threshold. (see Table 1, B=0.001, K=1.0, 1.1) This is indicative of a sharp
level crossing between two distinct states. The wavefunctions for these two states have zero overlap. The MDCW
ground state will continue to be pushed upward in energy with increasing K until it reaches the continuum.

In contrast, at high ﬁelds there is a slow migration of the ground state wavefunction away from the origin and
towards the outer well. The ground state energy is greater than Vs (but less than I) over a very wide range of K,
allowing for a slow transfer of probability with increasing K as the MDCW state forms a saddle state which eventually
delocalizes. In Fig. 5 we show the value of the ground state wavefunction at the origin as a function of K for several
values of B. Note for small B the abrupt drop at the point of the level crossing; for large B, there is a smooth decay
indicative of the slow transfer of probability from the MDCW to the OW.

The ground state of positronium will become a delocalized state at suﬃciently high K. This is an important result,
because it implies that any positronium formed under these conditions will have a long-lived ground state that is
stable against direct annihilation. For low ﬁelds, the ground state is extended in space and weakly bound; at high
ﬁeld strengths, the size of the atom in the high K limit is small and the binding energy is large.

The decay rate for positronium is

5

Γ = σvρ

(13)

where σ is the plane-wave cross section for free pair annihilation, v is the relative velocity of the electron and positron,
and ρ is the square of the wavefunction evaluated at contact. In the ﬁeld-free case, the lowest order decay rate for
106s−1 [21,22]. The
the ground state of parapositronium is Γ = 8.03
distinction between ortho- and para-positronium is meaningless in the present discussion. The spin-spin interaction
is dominated by the spin-ﬁeld interaction at ﬁeld strengths B > 10−5. We assume the spins are aligned with the ﬁeld
and the total energy and ionization energy are shifted by B. Nevertheless, the basic physics contained in the decay
rate formula is unchanged: the decay rate depends on the probability density at the origin and if the probability
density is zero, the Ps atom is stable against annihilation.

1010s−1; for orthopositronium, Γ = 7.21

×

×

At low ﬁelds 10−5 < B < 10−2, there is a well-deﬁned crossing between the MDCW ground state and OW ground
state near K = 1. The probability density at the origin drops dramatically at this crossing - over sixteen orders of
magnitude - resulting in a lifetime on the order of years. At higher ﬁelds, 0.1 < B < 10, the probability density at
the origin decreases exponentially with increasing K (Fig. 5); for B/K 2 < 10−2, the probability density is less than
10−16, again resulting in a lifetime greater than a year.

low-lying bound states in the OW increases with increasing K. The AHO approximation will break down long before
we reach the ionization threshold, although the potential remains approximately separable and harmonic in the x and
y. In the z direction, the level spacing decreases as one approaches the ionization threshold (at constant K) due to
the

potential. We expect the number of OW bound states is inﬁnite at high but ﬁnite K.

III. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have investigated the properties of the positronium atom in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds for a broad range
of magnetic ﬁeld strengths and values of the pseudomomentum. The occurence of magnetically distorted Coulomb
well states, saddle states and outer well states gives rise to a spectrum that is rich and unique. An intensive numerical
study via the ﬁnite element approach allowed us to investigate the diﬀerent regimes and study the transitions between
diﬀerent types of quantum states as a function of pseudomomentum.

We believe that there is rigorous theoretical and numerical evidence to support the prediction that long-lived states
of positronium exist in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The near zero probability for particle overlap prevents
direct annihilation. For large pseudomomentum (B/K 3 << 1), the ground state itself is a long-lived state.

Positronium in crossed ﬁelds is not an exotic system. Particle-antiparticle pairs occur in many diﬀerent physical
situations. Naturally occuring magnetic ﬁelds range from a few mGauss to 1012 in neutron stars. The answer to
the question whether Ps has ever been produced under the appropriate conditions for stability is in our opinion yes.
Detection of the system is a more diﬃcult problem.

One possible means for creating stable positronium at laboratory ﬁeld strengths is to prepare Landau states of e+
and e− with low relative velocity in the z direction. The initial positions and velocities of the two particles in the
external ﬁelds deﬁne the conserved pseudomomentum. Once an OW bound state is formed, the large dipole moment
exo of the OW state should make detection easy. The diﬃculty is to detect the positronium atom before it collides
with the container walls. It is not practical to use ﬁeld gradients for trapping, as the external ﬁelds must be constant
over the dimensions of the atom. Another possibility is to scatter positrons oﬀ hydrogen in crossed ﬁelds. A judicious
choice of experimental parameters may enhance the cross section for positronium formation in an OW state.

The search for stable positronium need not be limited to the laboratory. The spectra from neutron stars may
provide evidence of transitions between outer well states. These suggestions are not meant to conﬁne the search for
this system, but only to initiate a discussion that should challenge experimentalists in many subﬁelds.

In conclusion, we believe that the existence of stable Ps will be relevant in many areas of physics. One can only

speculate at this time on the possible applications of storing energy via a stable particle-antiparticle pair.

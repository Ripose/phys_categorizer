Parity nonconservation in Atomic Zeeman Transitions

(Dated: January 21, 2014)

We discuss the possibility of measuring nuclear anapole moments in atomic Zeeman transitions
and perform the necessary calculations. Advantages of using Zeeman transitions include variable
transition frequencies and the possibility of enhancement of parity nonconservation eﬀects.

PACS numbers: 32.80.Ys, 32.60.+i, 24.80.+y

Experiments on parity nonconservation in atoms have
measured the electron-nucleon weak interaction and have
provided very accurate tests of the Standard Model at
low energies (see, e.g., review [1]). It has been pointed
out in Ref.
[2] that atomic experiments can be used to
measure the nuclear anapole moment and study parity
nonconserving (PNC) nuclear forces. The measurement
of the anapole moment of 133Cs nucleus was reported
[3]. However, the strength of the PNC nuclear
in Ref.
forces extracted from this measurement seem to disagree
with the limits on these forces extracted from the 205Tl
anapole measurement performed in another atomic ex-
periment [4]. Moreover, the general situation with PNC
nuclear forces at the moment is controversial since dif-
ferent experiments give contradictory results (see, e.g.,
review [1]). This situation requires new measurements of
nuclear anapole moments.

The PNC interaction in atoms can be split into
a nuclear spin-dependent
(NSD) and nuclear spin-
independent (NSI) part. The NSI part is due to the
nuclear weak charge, and the PNC eﬀects produced by
the NSI part are two orders of magnitude larger than
the PNC eﬀects produced by the NSD part. There are
three contributions to the NSD part of the PNC interac-
tion: the nuclear anapole moment, the NSD part of the
electron-nucleus interaction, and the combination of the
NSI electron-nucleus weak interaction and the hyperﬁne
interaction. For heavy atoms the anapole moment con-
tribution dominates since it grows as A2/3[2, 5, 6]. In ex-
periments [3, 4] the NSD contribution was separated from
the much larger NSI contribution. The NSD contribution
is diﬀerent in diﬀerent hyperﬁne components of an opti-
cal transition and can be extracted from the diﬀerence
of the PNC eﬀects in these components. An alternative
method to measure the NSD interaction was suggested
in Ref. [7]. The NSI part is zero in transitions between
hyperﬁne terms of a ground state electronic level. The
measurements of PNC in the hyperﬁne transitions is sen-
sitive to the NSD PNC interaction only. Unfortunately,
no such experiment has been performed.

It was suggested in Refs.

[8] that the transitions be-
tween the Zeeman components of the hyperﬁne levels of
a ground state atom in a magnetic ﬁeld may be more
convenient for the measurements of PNC induced by the
NSD interaction, than transitions between the hyperﬁne
levels themselves. The NSI interaction still does not con-
tribute here, therefore, the measurement of the PNC ef-

fects in Zeeman transitions can provide a value of the
nuclear anapole moment. One advantage of using these
transitions is that for weak external magnetic ﬁelds, the
transition frequency is proportional to the ﬁeld and so
can be chosen arbitrarily small, and determined from the
conditions required for optimal experimental setup. Ad-
vantages of the low frequency were explained in the pro-
posal of possible experiments in hydrogen, potassium and
cesium hyperﬁne transitions [9]. At low frequencies one
does not need a resonator to produce the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. This greatly simpliﬁes the experiment and allows
the frequency to be set to the same value for diﬀerent
atoms. It should be noted that the PNC E1 amplitudes
of the Zeeman transitions in weak magnetic ﬁelds are
suppressed by a factor ¯hω/∆Ehf , where ω is the transi-
tion frequency and ∆Ehf is the hyperﬁne splitting. How-
ever, the E1 amplitude increases with nuclear charge as
Z 2A2/3Ra, where Ra is a relativistic correction factor
d
∝
(see, e.g. [1, 10] ), while the hyperﬁne splitting increases
Z. Combining these results we can see that
as ∆Ehf ∝
the E1 amplitude of Zeeman transitions increases faster
than ZA2/3 for heavy atoms in weak magnetic ﬁelds at
a ﬁxed transition frequency. This suggests that heavy
atoms should be considered as candidates for an experi-
ment.

Another possible advantage appears for Zeeman tran-
sitions in a strong magnetic ﬁeld [8, 9]. Parity noncon-
servation appear due to interference between the PNC
electric dipole amplitude, d, and the magnetic dipole am-
2 +
2Im(d/µ). In
µ

Im[2dµ/(
|
|
a strong magnetic ﬁeld an eigenstate is approximately
a product of the nuclear spin state times the electron
wave function. The M 1 amplitude, µ, between the Zee-
man states corresponding to nuclear spin-ﬂip is very
1000 times
small, since the nuclear magnetic moment is
smaller than the electron magnetic moment (in reality the
contribution from the small admixture of the state with
a diﬀerent electron angular momentum projection will
always dominate µ). The magnitude of the PNC am-
plitude, d, is not suppressed for such transitions. This
enhances the value of PNC eﬀects (
d/µ) containing µ
in the denominator.

In this paper we will consider three diﬀerent exper-
imental schemes: no magnetic ﬁeld, a weak magnetic
∆Ehf ), and a strong magnetic ﬁeld
ﬁeld (gµBB
(gµBB

late the ratio R = d/ωµ, where d is the PNC E1 am-

plitude, µ is the M1 amplitude and ω is the transition
frequency. A promising transition will have a relatively
large R, since the PNC E1 amplitude, d, will be large,
the background parity conserving M1 amplitude, µ, will
be relatively small, and ideally the transition frequency
should also be low, as mentioned previously.

We consider atoms and ions with the electron angular
momentum J = 1/2. In this case the only allowed values
for the total atomic angular momentum are F = I
1/2,
where I is the nuclear spin. In the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld, states with a ﬁxed F are split into states with a ﬁxed
projection, M , onto the external ﬁeld direction. The to-
tal angular momentum is no longer conserved, there is a
mixing of states with the same projection, M , resulting
in the appearance of the new states:

The dependence of the 133Cs 6s1/2 energy levels on
the external magnetic ﬁeld is presented in Figure 1. In
weak magnetic ﬁelds the energy diﬀerence of the hyper-
ﬁne term
is constant and equal to ∆Ehf
while the energy diﬀerence of the Zeeman terms is pro-
portional to the ﬁeld. In the strong ﬁeld the hyperﬁne
transition energy increases in proportion to the ﬁeld while
the Zeeman transition energy is constant and equal to
∆Ehf /(2I + 1). Here and below we neglect small terms

Here g is the atomic magnetic (Land´e) g-factor: g = 2
for the s1/2 valence electron (K, Rb, Cs, Ba+, Au, Fr),
and g = 2/3 for the p1/2 valence electron (Tl).

In weak ﬁelds the E1 amplitudes behave just like the
transition frequencies (they are proportional to the ﬁeld
for Zeeman transitions and constant for hyperﬁne ones),
while the M1 amplitudes are independent of the weak
ﬁeld. The R parameters, given by

are not interesting since the transition

Ψ(1), M
corresponds to ∆Iz = 2, result-
|
ing in the E1 amplitude being forbidden due to selection
rules, while for the transition
1
i
both the M1 and E1 amplitude are independent of the
magnetic ﬁeld and so the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of R
comes entirely from ω which increases linearly with mag-
netic ﬁeld, resulting in R decreasing inversely to the mag-
netic ﬁeld. By contrast, in the transition
i →
Ψ(2), M
the E1 amplitude is independent of the exter-
|
nal magnetic ﬁeld. The parameter R|Ψ(1),Mi→|Ψ(2),Mi can
also be shown to be independent of the ﬁeld and always
equal to R0. The E1 amplitude of the Zeeman transi-
tions in a strong magnetic ﬁeld reach a constant value,
comparable to the E1 amplitude of the hyperﬁne transi-
tions. The frequencies also reach a constant value, given
by ω = ∆Ehf /(2I + 1), while the M1 transition ampli-
tudes decrease in proportion to the ﬁeld. This results in
the R parameters increasing with the ﬁeld

Calculated R parameters for a collection of atoms are
presented in Table I. In Tables II, III and IV we present
ω, d and µ for the diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds. The dimen-
sionless coupling constant, κ, consisting mainly of the
anapole moment of the nucleus has been left as a free
parameter, we present an estimate of κa in Table III to
give an approximation of the size of this term. The P-odd
E1 transition amplitudes, d, R parameter and transition
frequencies, ω all depend upon the magnetic ﬁeld, but it
is useful to consider d and R as a function of ω. These
relationships are presented in Figures 2 and 3. Moving

FIG. 1: Zeeman splitting of the hyperﬁne terms of 133Cs
as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. In weak ﬁelds the splitting
between hyperﬁne levels (marked ∆Ehf ) is fairly constant and
the splitting between Zeeman levels increases linearly with the
ﬁeld. In strong ﬁelds the splitting between the hyperﬁne levels
increases linearly with the ﬁeld while the splitting between the
Zeeman levels reaches a constant separation (marked ωZ).

from left to right in these graphs corresponds to an in-
creasing magnetic ﬁeld. These ﬁgures show that for tran-
sitions with the same frequency, Zeeman transitions have
a larger P-odd E1 amplitude as well as a larger ratio of
the E1 amplitude to the P-even M1 amplitude than the
hyperﬁne transitions.

We conclude that Zeeman transitions in heavy atoms
have some advantages over the hyperﬁne transitions that
have been considered previously. The biggest advantage
is that the transition frequencies can be tuned to make
an experiment easier to perform, increase sensitivity and
provide additional control of systematic eﬀects by vary-
ing the magnetic ﬁeld. Zeeman transitions should be
considered as candidates for experiments to measure the
anapole moment of nuclei.

FIG. 2: P-odd E1 transition amplitudes between Zeeman and
hyperﬁne terms of diﬀerent atoms as a function of transition
frequency and external magnetic ﬁeld. The points represent
the elements and also represent the strength of the magnetic
ﬁeld, from left to right 0.0001 T, 0.001 T, 0.01 T, 0.1 T and
1T. The graph shows that the E1 amplitude of Zeeman tran-
sitions increases linearly with the ﬁeld for small ﬁelds before
reaching a constant value, but retains a constant value for
hyperﬁne transitions, independent of the ﬁeld.

FIG. 3: The ratio, R, of the PNC E1 amplitude, d, to the
background (ωµ) as a function of external ﬁeld and transition
frequency. The external magnetic ﬁeld is once again repre-
sented by the points, ranging from 0.0001 T up to 1 T from,
left to right. This graphs shows that R for Zeeman transitions
can be signiﬁcantly higher than for hyperﬁne transitions in the
same atom.

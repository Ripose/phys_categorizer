Ab initio calculations have been carried out to study the magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole hyperﬁne structure constants of 205Pb+. Many-body eﬀects have been con-

sidered to all orders using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory in the singles, doubles and

partial triples approximation. The trends of these eﬀects are found to be diﬀerent from

atomic systems that have been studied earlier.

I.

INTRODUCTION

With the advent of ion trapping techniques, it has become possible to perform high precision

measurements of diﬀerent atomic properties; including hyperﬁne structure constants for the ground

and low-lying excited states of stable isotopes [1, 2]. Studies of these interactions have served as

stringent tests of relativistic many-body theories. It has been found that the behavior of electron

correlation in the hyperﬁne interactions in the d-states is substantially diﬀerent from those of s-

and p- states [3]. The underlying reason for this is the strong and unusual core-polarization eﬀects

associated with the former.

The work presented in this paper is carried out using the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC)

theory. This theory has certain features which make it suitable for the calculations of excited

state properties. Prominent among them being its abilities to treat relativistic and correlation

eﬀects in the initial and ﬁnal states in a rigorous and balanced way [4].

It is equivalent to all

orders relativistic many-body perturbation theory. Core-polarization and pair-correlation eﬀects

which are important for such calculations are computed to all orders in this theory. It has been

successfully applied to heavy atomic systems with a single valence electron [4, 5].

205Pb is one of the stable isotopes of lead which has lifetime about 1.5 × 107 years. The nuclear

structure of this isotope is diﬀerent from the other stable isotope, 207Pb. It’s nuclear magnetic

moment and electric quadrupole moment are non-zero. Theoretical studies of the magnetic dipole

and electric quadrupole hyperﬁne structure constants of 205Pb+ are the focus of the present work.

There are relatively few measurements of the hyperﬁne structure constants for the excited states

of heavy atoms and ions. It is certainly worthwhile to perform highly correlated calculations of

these quantities for Pb+ as it could be a promising candidate for the observation of parity non-

conservation [6]. This theoretical eﬀort could motivate experimentalists to carry out high precision

measurements of 205Pb+.

In section II of this paper, we give an outline of the RCC theory and in section III we discuss

the pertinent details of the calculation. The results of our calculations are presented and discussed

in section III and ﬁnally we make some concluding remarks in section IV.

II. THEORY

In order to obtain the RCC wavefunction for Pb+, we require the closed-shell Pb++ wavefunc-

tion, which is given in terms of the lowest order Dirac-Fock (DF) wavefunction |ΦDF i, as

|Ψi = Ω|ΦDF i,

(2.1)

where in conventional many-body perturbation theory, the wave operator, Ω is expressed in powers

of the residual interaction, Ves =

i UDF (ri). This results in a hierarchy of approxima-

tions for the correlation energy and the wavefunction.

The coupled cluster theory is based on the following exponential ansatz for the closed-shell wave

operator [7]

Ω = N [exp(T )],

(2.2)

where the cluster operator T is expressed in terms of the connected diagrams of the wave operator.

The operator T also can be expressed in terms of the cluster operators Tn corresponding to diﬀerent

orders of excitations n of the core electrons from the DF state, |ΦDF i, explicitly deﬁned by,

with a, b, c, ..(p, q, r, ..) representing occupied (unoccupied) orbitals.

tp
a is the cluster amplitude

corresponding to the single excitation from the orbital a to p and so on. Termination of the

series at T2, results in the coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD). The

contribution from the Breit interaction [8] which is four orders of magnitude smaller than the

Coulomb interaction has been neglected in the present work.

For a single valence atomic system the wavefunction in the RCC method can be written as [7, 9]

with the new reference state

|Ψvi = eT {1 + Sv}|Φvi,

|Φvi = a†

v|ΦDF i,

for the given valence electron v; Sv represents excitation operators which excite at least the valence

electron. The explicit form of this operator can be written as

Sv = S1v + S2v + ...

(2.6)

An approximate treatment of the triple excitations to the CCSD method is included by con-

tracting the residual Coulomb operator, which eﬀectively forms a two-body operator, and the

double-excitation operators T2 and S2v [10], thereby deﬁning the CCSD(T) approximation

where ǫi is the orbital energy of the corresponding i’th electron.

III. METHOD OF CALCULATION

For computational simplicity, the T amplitudes are solved ﬁrst for the closed-shell Pb++ and

then the valence electron is attached to calculate the open-shell wavefunctions. The matrix equa-

tions for solving the correlation energy and the T amplitudes are given by

hΦDF |HN |ΦDF i = ∆Ecorr

hΦ∗

DF |HN |ΦDF i = 0,

where HN is the normal ordering Hamiltonian which can be written as HN = fN + VN , sum of
one-body and two-body terms. In the above equation, HN is deﬁned as HN = e−T HN eT , ∆Ecorr
is the correlation energy and |Φ∗

DF i corresponds to excited states from |ΦDF i.

For the open-shell RCC calculations, the Sv operators are solved using the following equations

hΦv|HN {1 + Sv}|Φvi = −∆Ev

hΦ∗

v|HN {1 + Sv}|Φvi = −∆EvhΦ∗

v|{Sv}|Φvi,

where ∆Ev is the ionization potential (IP) energy of the corresponding valence electron v. Similarly

|Φ∗

vi are the excited states from |Φvi.

The relativistic hyperﬁne Hamiltonian is given by [11]

Hhf s =

M(k) · T(k),

Xk

where M(k) and T(k) are spherical tensor operators of rank k. In ﬁrst-order perturbation theory,

hyperﬁne energies Ehf s(J) of the ﬁne-structure state |JMJ i are expectation values of the hyperﬁne

interaction Hamiltonian. Details of the expression are given by Chang and Childs [11]. The

magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperﬁne energies are deﬁned by

respectively. Here I and J being the total angular momentum of the nucleus and the electron state,

respectively, and K = 2hI · Ji. The magnetic dipole hyperﬁne constant A and electric quadrupole

hyperﬁne constant B are deﬁned as

where we have used the abbreviations f.c., o.b. and t.b.

for fully contracted, eﬀective one-body

and eﬀective two-body terms respectively. In this expansion of O, the eﬀective one-body terms are

computed keeping terms of the form of

Oo.b. = O + T †O + OT + T †OT.

(3.14)

The calculation procedure for these terms are given by Geetha et al [5]. They are ﬁnally

connected with Sv and S†

v operators in the evaluation of properties . Contributions due to the

eﬀective two-body terms from O are constructed using the procedure shown diagrammatically in

our earlier works [5, 12] and computed directly during the calculation of properties.The following

Other eﬀective terms correspond to higher orders in the residual Coulomb interaction and are

neglected in the present calculation. A similar procedure has been followed to account for the

normalization factor.

The contributions from the normalization factors for the corresponding valence electron v that

are given in in tables III and IV, were obtained using the following relations:

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The starting point of our calculations is the generation of DF orbitals for 205Pb++. These

orbitals are constructed as linear combinations of Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) as given by

6

Chaudhuri et al.

[13]. It has been found [6] that the RCC calculations based on these kind of

GTOs provide accurate A− values for the low-lying states of 207Pb+.

In the present work, we

have used similar basis functions to calculate both A− and B− values of ground and some of the

important excited states of 205Pb+.

In table I, we present A and B hyperﬁne structure constants of the low-lying states of Pb+. We

use the Lande nuclear g-factor, gI = 0.28468 to calculate A and nuclear quadrupole moment, Q

= 0.234 to calculate B [14]. From the diﬀerences of the DF and RCC results given in table I, it

is evident that for both the hyperﬁne constants A and B the electron correlation eﬀects vary from

All the core orbitals were excited in our calculations. The core-polarization eﬀects, which are

the largest contributors to the hyperﬁne constants of the 6p3/2 state of 207Pb+ [6] and the d5/2

states of the alkaline earth ions [15], have been accounted to all orders through the OS2v term.

It was also found from the hyperﬁne structure studies of the s1/2 and p1/2 states in the alkaline

earth ions that pair-correlation and core-polarization eﬀects are important. In order to appreciate

the importance of these eﬀects in Pb+, we present their contributions in table II. Comparison of

these results with their corresponding DF values from Table I, brings out some distinct many-body

features of the system. The most prominent among them is the size of the core-correlation and

core-polarization eﬀects for the d− states. As in the case of some of the alkaline earth ions, the

sign of the core-polarization eﬀect in the d5/2 state is opposite that of the DF value and the net

contribution is 209% of the corresponding DF value. However, unlike those alkaline earth ions

[15] the ﬁnal RCC result has the same sign as the DF result. This is due to the large positive

contributions from the S†

2vOS2v term, shown in table III . Therefore, it is imperative to consider

such terms to obtain accurate results.

The role of electron correlation in the hyperﬁne interactions in 45Sc and 89Y has similarities

[3] with Pb+ even though those systems are neutral and have diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations.

Another interesting feature of the present study on 205Pb+ is that the RCC result of the A− value

of 6d3/2 is of opposite in sign than that of the DF result. This trend is diﬀerent from the other d3/2

states in alkaline earth ions [3, 16]. The main reason for this behavior is due to another unusual
contribution from S†

2vOS2v. The core correlation eﬀect on B− values though reduces as higher

excited states are considered, which is expected, but contributions to the d− states are not similar

to the p− states. This is evident from the B− values given in table II.

Table III and IV present the important eﬀective two-body terms obtained from O = eT †

OeT ,

but they contribute very little. One can therefore justiﬁably ignore the higher order terms given in

eqn. (3.15) and save computational time. The correlation eﬀects of the A− values of other states

presented in table I, behave the same way as in 207Pb+ [6].

V. CONCLUSION

The RCC theory has been employed to study the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole

hyperﬁne structure constants of the 205Pb+. Strong electron correlations eﬀects are found in the

d− states and their behavior is diﬀerent from other systems studied earlier. Experiments to measure

these quantities will constitute important tests of the relativistic coupled-cluster theory.

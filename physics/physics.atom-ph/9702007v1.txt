Abstract

The Gaussian Wave-Packet phase-space representation is used to show that

the expansion in powers of ¯h of the quantum Liouville propagator leads, in

the zeroth order term, to results close to those obtained in the statistical

quasiclassical method of Lee and Scully in the Weyl-Wigner picture.

It is

also veriﬁed that propagating the Wigner distribution along the classical tra-

jectories the amount of error is less than that coming from propagating the

Gaussian distribution along classical trajectories.

I. INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, the advantages and diﬃculties for using the phase-space formulation of quan-

tum mechanics are well known [1–3]. This formulation remains still very useful for studying

the classical limit of quantum mechanics as well as for describing semiclassical approx-

imations in collisional processes; for these purposes many authors use the Weyl-Wigner

(WW)picture [1,4–6]. For the collisional problem it is often combined with the quasiclassi-

cal method of Ref. [7]. Following this approach Lee and Scully [1] have improved the accuracy

of this method successfully with their Statistical Quasiclassical (SQC) method which was

ﬁrst suggested by Heller [8]. As we have shown in a previous paper [9], the approach of Lee

and Scully corresponds to the zeroth order term of the expansion of the quantum Liouvillian

in powers of ¯h in the WW picture. So, their calculated transition probabilities could have

higher order corrections.

The aim of this article is to show that the use of the Gaussian Wave Packet (GWP)

phase-space representation [3,10,11] gives for the zeroth order term, which corresponds to

what we call the Causal Approximation (CA), results similar to those obtained in the WW

representation [1].

In the derivation of the expansion of the quantum Liouvillian in the GWP picture all

orders of ¯h are included; the ﬁrst order term we shall call the Quasicausal Approximation

(QCA). As it is shown in Refs. [10,11] one of the advantages of the GWP representation is

that the quantum ﬂuctuations of the mapped physical quantities become more evident; also

the distribution function obtained when the density operator for a pure state is mapped into

this representation is always non-negative.

Here we are also interested in verifying numerically, for the collisional problem, the state-

ment put forward by Lee [3]: “the amount of error arising from propagating the Wigner

distribution function (WDF) along the classical trajectories is usually considerably less than

that coming from propagating other distributions along classical trajectories”. In our case

the other distribution is the GWP distribution [10–12]. It is in agreement with Lee’s state-

3

ment the result we derive in Sec. II: ﬁrst order corrections in ¯h in the SQC method do not

improve the numerical results of Lee and Scully [1].

In our comparison of the Weyl-Wigner formalism with the GWP approach we are going

to work with a collinear non-reactive collision of an atom with a diatomic molecule, the

interaction between them being an exponential repulsion, ﬁrst used by Secrest and John-

son [13], of the form V = V0 exp[−α(x − y)] where the constant V0 is related to the classical

turning point of the trajectory of the particle but its value does not have any eﬀect on the

results. In the WW and GWP formalisms we have taken this potential, the deﬁnition of

the x and y coordinates, as well as the value of α and V0 from Ref. [13], the parameter α

is adjusted by published experimental data [13]. The mapped Hamiltonian in the GWP

formalism has the constant V0 renormalized.

In Sec. II we shall summarize our previous paper (Ref. [9]). In Sec. III we introduce

the GWP representation and the CA and QCA. In Sec. IV we derive expressions for the

transition probabilities and numerical results are presented in Sec. V.

II. CAUSAL AND QUASICAUSAL APPROXIMATIONS IN THE WW

FORMALISM

In the ﬁrst part of this section we are going to give a review of Ref. [9]. The quantum

Liouville equation in the WW picture is [14]

where (q, p) is a point of phase-space and W (q, p, t) is the Wigner distribution function

(WDF). We are using just one dimension. The quantum Liouvillian is

H(q, p) being the Hamiltonian of the system and the operator

In Ref. [9] we show that from the formal solution of Eq. (1) given by

W (q, p, t) = e−iLQ(t−t0)W0(q, p),

where W0(q, p) is the WDF at the initial time t0. Taking the classical limit of LQ in Eq.(2)

we get

and Eq. (4) becomes

Lcl = iH(q, p)

↔
Λ,

W (0)(q, p, t) = e−iLcl(t−t0)W0(q, p) = W0 (q(t0 − t), p(t0 − t)) .

Thus, each point (q, p) of the phase space of the initial WDF evolves classically according

to Hamilton’s equations, following a classical trajectory reversed in time. This we call the

Causal Approximation (CA).

This formalism is applied in Ref. [9] to a collisional process where a molecule suﬀers a

collision from a pointlike projectile. As a result the molecule is transferred from the initial

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the CA, while the second one is the QCA. The CA

corresponds to the statistical quasiclassical (SQC) method of Lee and Scully given in Ref. [1].

Here as in Ref. [1] the H2 − He collision is considered, H2 and He being treated as an

harmonic oscillator and a free particle respectively. The Hamiltonian in the Weyl-Wigner

phase space is given by

H(Q, q, P, p) =

+

kq2 + V0e−α(Q−q),

(13)

where Q and q are the translational and vibrational coordinates respectively, P and p being

their respective momenta. All the parameters appearing in Eq.(13), M, m, V0, α and k =

mω2 (elastic constant of the oscillator) are taken from Ref. [13].

Following Lee and Scully (Refs. [1,3]) Q, q, P, p obey Hamilton’s equations, so they de-

scribe classical trajectories, the initial state Wi(q0, p0) in Eq.(12), is given by the WDF for

the harmonic oscillator, the pair (q0, p0) refers to the initial position and momentum of the

harmonic oscillator and it belongs to a two-dimensional rectangular grid whose size and

density depend on the desired accuracy.

Integrating numerically Hamilton’s equations for each (q0, p0) of the grid for the harmonic

oscillator and the appropriate initial Q and P of the particle, we get the set of ﬁnal pairs

6

(q, p) for the oscillator and ﬁnal (Q, P ) for the particle, initial and ﬁnal Q must be taken

suﬃciently large so that the particle can be considered free, which can be veriﬁed by using

the fact that the total energy must be conserved along the trajectories.

In Eq.(12) the ﬁnal state of the system is now given by the WDF, Wf (q, p) calculated

for all ﬁnal phase space points of the grid. Once initial and ﬁnal WDF are calculated for

each point, the CA can be obtained using the ﬁrst term in Eq.(12).

In order to obtain the QCA, the second term in Eq.(12) must be calculated. This term

can be approximated by [12]

CQCA = BFif

Now we are going to show that this correction, given by Eq.(14) oscillates periodically

with the molecule. At this time the coordinate and momentum of the classical harmonic

q0M = A cos(ωtM + φ0)

At a later time t = tM + ∆t, with ∆t > 0, the momentum p0(t) of the harmonic oscillator

p0(t) = p0M cos(ω ∆t) − mωq0M sin(ω ∆t).

(17)

Thus, making a = p0M and b = −mωq0M , one has

0(t) = a3 cos3 ω∆t + b3 sin3 ω∆t + 3ab2 cos ω∆t sin2 ω∆t + 3a2b sin ω∆t cos2 ω∆t.

(18)

From Eq.(17) and Eq.(18) we obtain for Eq.(16)

A0p3

0(t) + B0p0(t) = a3 cos 3ω∆t + b3 sin 3ω∆t + a1 cos ω∆t + b1 sin ω∆t,

b3 = iA0(α3 − α∗3),

b1 = i(3A0αα∗ + B0)(α − α∗),

and α = (1/2)(a − ib). Eq.(19) is a Fourier’s series, which substituted into Eq.(15) shows

that CQCA in Eq.(14) is a periodical function, since in this equation the integral in the time

converges in the limit t → ∞. The average of this periodical function over one period of the

oscillator will be zero. In this derivation we have used the approximate expression for the

correction of the transition rate given by Eq.(14). The exact demonstration, although more

envolved, follows along similar lines.

III. CAUSAL AND QUASICAUSAL APPROXIMATIONS IN THE GWP

FORMALISM

In the GWP representation [10–12], operators can be mapped both into a covariant (CV )

and a contravariant (CT V ) form and there are expressions which relate the CV with the

CT V form as well as both of them with the corresponding W W representation.

The commutator of two operators of the Hilbert space A and B in the CV form is

written [3,10,11]

where (q, p) is a point in a phase-space, |pqi represents the minimum uncertainty gaussian

wave-packet or coherent state, ACV (q, p) and BCV (q, p) are the CV forms of operators A

and B and

Γ= exp[(¯h/2)

The quantum Liouville equation in the CV representation for the density operator

One deﬁnes a Green’s function [11] by

w(q, p, t0|q0, p0, t0),

with the condition

lim

w(q, p, t|q0, p0, t0) = δ(q − q0)δ(p − p0).

This Green’s function satisﬁes the Liouville equation

where the pairs (q0, p0) , and (q, p) are the momenta and the coordinates at times t0 and t

respectively. Here, as discussed in Ref. [9], classical causality is broken in the ¯h power series

expansion of LCV when terms with n ≥ 1 are retained.

correction n = 1 term, the quasicausal approximation (QCA) is obtained.

We use the model and method described by Lee and Scully [1,3] for the one-dimensional

atom-molecule collinear collision, but in the GWP phase-space formulation. Here also in

this non-reactive process the atom is treated like a free classical structureless particle while

the molecule is represented by a harmonic oscillator. The interaction between the atom and

the molecule [13] is the exponential repulsion described in Sec. I. The Hamiltonian for this

system in the CV representation is

tic constant) are taken from Ref. [13], ﬁtting the He-H2 system. The CT V form of the

Hamiltonian is obtained from Eq. (31) by replacing a2

0 by −a2

0 [11].

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (37) is the CA which is the zeroth order term of our ¯h power series-

expansion, and corresponds to the expression of the Statistical Quasiclassical (SQC) method

of Lee and Scully [1]. The diﬀerence between these two expressions lies in the distribution

functions, while Lee and Scully work with the product of two Wigner Distribution Functions

(WDF), in Eq. (37) we have the product of two Gaussian Distribution Functions (GDF),

one of them in the CT V form and the other in the CV form.

Like in the SQC method, [1,3] here P CT V

i

(q, p, t0) represents the initial vibrational state

of the system, which we propagate along the classical trajectories. We also use the Lee and

the CA which corresponds to the ﬁrst term in Eq. (37).

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Using the mapped form of the quantum Liouville equation into the GWP phase-space

we have derived expressions for the transition probabilities for semiclassical calculations of

inelastic atom-molecule collisions which include also the quantum terms. These expressions

are similar to those obtained in Ref. [9] for the WW formalism.

We show in Tables I and II the transition probabilities Pi→f from the initial (i) to the

ﬁnal (f ) state of the He-H2 system which were computed ﬁrst by integrating numerically

the Schr¨odinger equation, (these are the exact quantum mechanical results (QM) taken from

Ref. [13]), second by using the Weyl-Wigner representation in the statistical quasiclassical

(SQC) method taken from Ref. [1] and third by using the gaussian wave-packet representa-

tion in the causal approximation (GWP). The last ones are our results and they are given

by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (37). For more details on the system and models see the mentioned

references.

The results in Tables I and II obtained using only the zeroth order term for both methods

SQC and GWP should improve if quantum corrections were introduced.

The accuracy of the SQC and the GWP methods was checked by studying how well

the transition probabilities obey microscopic reversibility, the results are presented in Table

III. These results conﬁrm that for the CA, the amount of error coming from propagating

the WDF along classical trajectories is less than that coming from propagating the GWP

distribution also along the classical trajectories, as stated in Ref. [3]. This agrees with the

vanishing result found in Section II for the correction to the CA in the WW formalism. How-

ever, preliminary calculations of the ﬁrst quantum correction (QCA) in the GWP formalism

gave nonzero results.

Both methods (SQC and GWP) give nonvanishing results for classically forbidden pro-

cesses. The numerical calculations, as far as the CA is concerned, for both formalisms

present almost the same degree of diﬃculty for being performed.

APPENDIX: DERIVATION OF THE CT V FORM OF THE GDF

Let |ϕni, with n = 0, 1, 2... be the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and |αi = |pqi

a coherent state, the CV form for the density operator [10,15] hpq|ϕnihϕn|pqi is given by

the classical harmonic oscillator and r2 = E

We see that this CV form of the GDF depends only on the energy of the harmonic oscillator.

states [15] which relates the normal (NO) and antinormal (AO) ordering of a function f of

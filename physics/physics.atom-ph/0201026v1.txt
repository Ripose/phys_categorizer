We report on a measurement of the highly forbidden 6s2 1S0 → 5d6s 3D1 magnetic-dipole tran-
sition in atomic ytterbium using the Stark-interference technique. This amplitude is important in
interpreting a future parity nonconservation experiment that exploits the same transition. We ﬁnd
−4µ0, where the larger uncertainty comes from
|h5d6s 3D1|M 1|6s2 1S0i| = 1.33(6)Stat(20)β × 10
the previously measured vector transition polarizability β. The M 1 amplitude is small and should
not limit the precision of the parity nonconservation experiment.

The proposal

to measure parity nonconservation
(PNC) in the 6s2 1S0 → 5d6s 3D1 transition in atomic yt-
terbium (Yb) [1] has prompted both theoretical [2, 3] and
experimental [4, 5] studies. The magnetic-dipole (M 1)
amplitude for this transition is a key quantity for evaluat-
ing the feasibility of a PNC-Stark interference experiment
as proposed in [1]. A non-zero M 1 amplitude coupled
with imperfections in the apparatus can lead to system-
atic uncertainties in a PNC experiment. Here we present
the ﬁrst experimental determination of the magnetic-
dipole amplitude for the 6s2 1S0 → 5d6s 3D1 transition.
Our method is based on the technique of Stark interfer-
ence [6, 7, 8]. The study of highly forbidden transitions
is also useful for improving atomic calculations of heavy
atoms [9].

In

ﬁelds,
the
6s2 1S0 → 5d6s 3D1 transition (Fig.
1) is highly
suppressed.

magnetic-dipole transition amplitude is also highly for-
bidden because of both LS-coupling and the s-d nature
of the transition. Consequently, a nonzero transition
amplitude exists only as a result of conﬁguration mixing
and spin-orbit interaction in both the upper and lower
states [1]. There have been no detailed calculations
[1], gives
of this amplitude. A rough estimate in Ref.
∼ 10−4µ0, where µ0 is the Bohr
a value of |A(M 1)| <
magneton.

In the presence of a static external electric ﬁeld, E,
there is a parity-conserving mixing between the even par-
ity 5d6s 3D1 state and the odd parity states. For a
J = 0 → J = 1 transition, this mixing leads to a
Stark-induced electric-dipole transition amplitude given
by [6]

A(E1St) = i β (E × ˆε)MJ ,

(1)

where ˆε is the direction of the polarization of the laser
light, (E × ˆε)M is the M component of the vector in the
spherical basis, and the vector transition polarizability β
is a real parameter. The magnitude of β was measured:
[5]

|β| = 2.18(33) × 10

−8ea0/(V /cm).

(2)

In an electric ﬁeld, the transition amplitude is the sum
of the Stark-induced E1 amplitude and the forbidden M 1
amplitude. The corresponding transition rate is

W ∝ |A(E1St) + A(M 1)|2

(3)

∗
≈ |A(E1St)|2 + 2Re(cid:2)A(E1St)A(M 1)

(cid:3),

where we neglect the contribution from |A(M 1)|2 since
|A(M 1)| ≪ |A(ESt)| with the electric ﬁelds and polariza-
tion angles used here. Since A(E1St) is proportional to
the electric ﬁeld, the interference term changes sign when
the electric ﬁeld is reversed. Thus, reversing the electric
ﬁeld direction changes the total transition rate allowing

the interference term to be isolated from the larger terms.
The M 1 amplitude is given by

A(M 1) = h3D1, MJ = ±1|M 1|1S0i(ˆk × ˆε)MJ ,

(4)
ˆk is the direction of propagation of the excita-
where
tion light. Equation 1 implies that only the MJ = ±1
components are excited by A(E1St), where the axis of
quantization is chosen along the electric ﬁeld. With laser
propagation perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, the sign
of the interference term is opposite for the transitions to
the MJ = ±1 components, as can be veriﬁed by a simple
calculation. Thus, in order to observe the eﬀect of the
Stark-M1 interference, we apply a magnetic ﬁeld, B, al-
lowing us to resolve diﬀerent magnetic sublevels. For a
magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the electric ﬁeld (Fig. 2) the
interference term in the transition probability is propor-
tional to the rotational invariant (E × ˆε) × (ˆk × ˆε) · ˆB.

Comparison of the diﬀerence in the transition rate be-
tween opposite electric ﬁeld states to the sum is a mea-
sure of the fractional asymmetry a, deﬁned as

where θ is the angle between the dc electric ﬁeld and the
polarization of the excitation light (Fig. 2). The asym-
metry increases with decreasing θ while the dominant
signal decreases as sin2(θ). Most of the data was taken
at θ = ±45◦, where the interference term is maximal.

Much of the apparatus used in this experiment had
been used for the measurement of the Stark-induced tran-
sition amplitude and is described in detail in Ref. [5, 10].
A stainless steel oven with a multi-channel nozzle created
an eﬀusive atomic beam of Yb atoms inside of a vacuum
chamber with a residual pressure of ≈ 5 × 10−6 T orr.
The oven nozzle collimation resulted in a Doppler width
for the 408-nm transition of ≈ 150M Hz. The oven was
heated with tantalum wire heaters operating at ≈ 500 ◦C
in the rear with the front ≈ 100 ◦C hotter to avoid clog-
ging. Atomic Yb has seven stable isotopes with both zero
and nonzero nuclear spin (168Y b, 170Y b, 172Y b, 174Y b,
176Y b, I = 0; 171Y b, I = 1/2; and 173Y b, I = 5/2).
There was signiﬁcant overlap of the optical spectra of the
zero-nuclear-spin isotopes and the hyperﬁne components
of the nonzero-nuclear-spin isotopes. An external vane
collimator reduced the Doppler width to ≈ 15 M Hz.
The vane collimator was made by layering 0.076 mm
thick sheets of stainless steel foil between 0.94 mm thick
stainless steel spacers. The length of the collimator was
5.1 cm, providing a collimation angle of ≈ 1◦. The width
of the collimator was 3.8 cm. The collimator was heated
using tantalum wire heaters to ≈ 350 ◦C to prevent clog-
ging. The collimator was mounted on a movable plat-
form, allowing precise alignment of the angle of the colli-
mator relative to the atomic beam during the experiment.

FIG. 2: Schematic of apparatus.

We estimate an atomic density of ≈ 2 × 109 cm−3 in
the interaction region.

Approximately 80 mW of laser light at 408 nm excited
ytterbium atoms to the 5d6s 3D1 state in the geometry
shown in Fig. 2. The 408-nm light was produced by
frequency doubling of ≈ 1.2 W of 816-nm light from a
titanium-sapphire laser (Coherent 899-21) pumped with
≈ 12 W from a multi-line argon ion laser (Sectra Physics
2080). A commercial bow-tie resonator with a Lithium
Triborate crystal (Laser Analytical Systems Wavetrain
cw) provided frequency doubling.

A photomultiplier tube (Burle 8850) monitored the ﬂu-
orescence in the 6s6p 3P1 → 6s2 1S0 decay channel at
556 nm (Fig. 1). The top electrode has an array of 198
0.12 cm diameter holes, allowing the ﬂuorescence to be
collected by a Lucite light guide and conducted to the
photomultiplier tube. An interference ﬁlter with trans-
mission centered at 560 nm with a 10 nm full width at
half maximum was placed in front of the photomulti-
plier tube in order to limit detection of scattered light at
408 nm. The laser frequency was scanned ≈ 200 M Hz
with both increasing and decreasing frequency over the
transition and the ﬂuorescence spectrum was recorded
with a digital oscilloscope and sent to a computer. The
scan time each way was typically 1 s. A typical single
scan is shown in Fig. 3.

After the laser was scanned the polarity of the electric
ﬁeld was either switched or left unchanged in accordance
to the following pattern:
(+ − − + − + + −).
This pattern was chosen to limit systematic eﬀects asso-
ciated with drifts in the laser frequency and atomic beam
intensity. A bipolar power supply (Spellman CZE1000R),
which was modiﬁed so that the polarity was controlled
by a TTL pulse generated from the computer, produced
the high voltage used in the experiment. The polarity
of the top electrode was reversed while the bottom elec-
trode remained grounded. A high-voltage resistor divider

monitored the value of the electric ﬁeld. The magni-
tude of the electric ﬁeld changed by < 0.1% with the
change in polarity. A delay of ≈ 2 s after each switch
allowed the electric ﬁeld plates to fully charge before the
next scan. The typical value of the electric ﬁeld was
≈ 12 kV /cm. After each sequence of E-ﬁeld switches,
the polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld was switched according
to the (+ − − +) pattern. The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
was reduced to <
∼ 50 mG with external coils. A pair of in-
vacuum coils in a near Helmholtz conﬁguration provided
the uniform magnetic ﬁeld needed for the experiment.
A typical magnetic ﬁeld was 36 G. Between 5 and 10
sets of 32 forward and backward laser scans (8 E-ﬁeld
switches × 4 B-ﬁeld switches per set) were made for each
conﬁguration of light polarization and magnitudes of the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld. Periodically ≈ 50 laser scans
were taken with zero magnetic ﬁeld in order to compen-
sate for changes in the lineshape of the transition due to
temperature ﬂuctuations of the oven and collimator.

A temperature stabilized, hermetically sealed Fabry-
Perot cavity with a free spectral range of 150 M Hz was
used to monitor a portion of the 816 nm light. A pho-
todiode monitored the 408-nm laser power in order to
normalize the signal for power ﬂuctuations. The trans-
mission through the Fabry-Perot and the 408-nm laser
power were recorded concurrently with the ﬂuorescence
signal.

The Fabry-Perot transmission peaks were used to line
up the ﬂuorescence spectra of two consecutive laser scans
in order to eliminate frequency drift between scans. Two
scans at diﬀerent electric ﬁelds and the same magnetic
ﬁeld were combined. The sum of the two ﬂuorescence
spectra was ﬁt to the function

W (E+) + W (E−) =

ζ(f (ν − c1) + f (ν − c2)) + m ν + b,

(6)

where ν is the frequency of the laser, c1(2) is the center
position of the ﬁrst (second) peak, ζ is the amplitude of
the peaks, m and b account for any linear background
coming from scattered light. The function f was numeri-
cally determined from the spectra taken at zero magnetic
ﬁeld. Because the sign of the interference term is oppo-
site for the diﬀerent magnetic sublevels (see Eq. 5), the
spectral dependence of the asymmetry is given by the
diﬀerence between the MJ = ±1 peaks multiplied by an
asymmetry coeﬃcient. The diﬀerence between the two
spectra was therefore ﬁt to a function whose line shape
was constrained by the ﬁt parameters from the sum ﬁt:

W (E+) − W (E−) =

a ζ( f (ν − c1) − f (ν − c2)) + C,

(7)

where a is the asymmetry coeﬃcient given in Eq. 5, and
C accounts, at lowest order, for any possible background
that may be present in the diﬀerence due to a constant
oﬀset in the electric ﬁeld which does not change sign with

the electric ﬁeld switch. Changing the polarity of the
magnetic ﬁeld reverses the sign of a since the frequency
position of the magnetic sublevels switches (Eq. 5). Note
that the asymmetry coeﬃcient does not depend on the
value of the magnetic ﬁeld.

The measurements were performed on isotope 174Yb
which has a large relative abundance and is spectrally
well isolated. The M 1 transition amplitude was mea-
sured in a variety of diﬀerent ﬁeld values and conﬁg-
urations. The electric ﬁeld was varied from 5 kV /cm
to 20 kV /cm, the polarization angle from −70◦ to 70◦,
and the magnetic ﬁeld from 12 G to 84 G.
In ad-
dition, data was taken without the external collima-
tor. For this data the overlap between the 174Yb and
173Yb (cid:0)F = 5
2 (cid:1) lines was signiﬁcant and the
analysis modiﬁed to include eﬀects of this transition.

2 → F ′ = 5

The eﬀects of misalignments of the ﬁelds and imperfect
reversals were analyzed analytically and using a numer-
ical density matrix formalism. These calculations indi-
cate that systematic eﬀects are signiﬁcantly smaller than
the statistical uncertainty. Possible systematic eﬀects are
also severely constrained by conﬁrming the characteris-
tics of the asymmetry. The method of analysis described
above is sensitive to asymmetries which reverse sign with
the electric ﬁeld and is of opposite sign for the two mag-
netic sublevels. Equation 5 implies that the sign of the
asymmetry should also reverse with the magnetic ﬁeld
and the polarization angle. Asymmetries which did not
reverse sign with either the magnetic ﬁeld or the polar-
ization angle were consistent with zero. In addition, the
dependence of the magnitude of the asymmetry on the
magnitude of the electric ﬁeld and polarization angle was
also veriﬁed.

The ﬁnal value of the M 1 amplitude is based on data
taken on two diﬀerent days. The data is shown in Fig.
4. The circles represent data taken with the external
collimator and the squares represent data taken without
the external collimator. The statistical error for each

for each complete sequence of electric and magnetic ﬁeld
switches within a given conﬁguration. These errors are
in agreement with error estimates based on shot noise.
The variation of the errors is due to diﬀerences in sen-
sitivity for diﬀerent polarization angles (see Eq. 5) and
diﬀerences in the amount of data taken in a given con-
ﬁguration. The ﬁnal result is

where the second error represents the uncertainty in the

The isotopes with nonzero nuclear spin (171Yb, I =
1/2 and 173Yb, I = 5/2) also have a contribution to the
M 1 amplitude due to hyperﬁne eﬀects. This contribu-
∼ 10−5µ0 [1]. In addition, hyper-

of these eﬀects will be investigated in future work.

The measured value of A(M 1) agrees with the esti-
mate in Ref. [1]. This value is ≈ 3 times larger than the
corresponding amplitude in the cesium (Cs) transition
where PNC is studied [8, 11, 12, 13]. However, the ex-
pected large enhancement of the PNC amplitude in Yb
(≈ 100 times larger than in Cs [1]) makes the relative
size of A(M 1) to the PNC amplitude smaller than it is
in Cs. An additional suppression of spurious interference
between the M 1 amplitude and the Stark-induced am-
plitude is possible by using the geometry for the PNC
experiment employed in Ref. [14]. Thus, the size of the
M 1 amplitude should not limit the precision of a Yb PNC
measurement which is in progress in our laboratory.

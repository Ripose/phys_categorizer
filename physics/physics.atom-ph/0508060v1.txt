We present a multichannel quantum-defect theory for slow atomic collisions that takes advan-
tages of the analytic solutions for the long-range potential, and both the energy and the angular-
momentum insensitivities of the short-range parameters. The theory provides an accurate and
complete account of scattering processes, including shape and Feshbach resonances, in terms of a
few parameters such as the singlet and the triplet scattering lengths. As an example, results for
23Na-23Na scattering are presented and compared close-coupling calculations.

INTRODUCTION

Slow atomic collisions are at the very foundation of
cold-atom physics, since they determine how atoms in-
teract with each other and how this interaction might be
manipulated [1, 2]. While substantial progress has been
made over the past decade [3], there are still areas where
the existing theoretical framework is less than optimal.
For example, all existing numerical methods may have
diﬃculty with numerical stability in treating ultracold
collisions in partial waves other than the s wave, because
the classically forbidden region grows inﬁnitely wide as
one approaches the threshold. This diﬃculty becomes
a serious issue when there is a shape resonance right at
or very close to the threshold, as the usual argument
that the s wave scattering dominates would no longer be
applicable. Another area where a more optimal formu-
lation is desirable is analytic representation. Since much
of our interest in cold atoms is in complex three-body
and many-body physics, a simple, preferably analytical
representation of cold collisions would not only be very
helpful to experimentalists, but also make it much easier
to incorporate accurate two-body physics in theories for
three and many-atom systems. Existing formulations of
cold collisions provide little analytical results especially
in cases, such as the alkali-metal atoms, where the atomic
interaction is complicated by hyperﬁne structures. Fur-
thermore, whatever analytic results that we do have have
been based almost exclusively on the eﬀective-range the-
ory [4], the applicability of which is severely limited by
the long-range atomic interaction [5, 6].

Built upon existing multichannel quantum-defect the-
ories that are based either on free-particle reference func-
tions or on numerical solutions for the long-range poten-
tial [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], we present here a multichan-
nel, angular-momentum-insensitive, quantum-defect the-
ory (MAQDT) that overcomes many of the limitations of
existing formulations. It is a generalization of its single-

channel counterpart [13, 14, 15], and takes full advantage
of both the analytic solutions for the long-range poten-
tial [16, 17], and the angular momentum insensitivity of
a properly deﬁned short-range K matrix K c [13, 15]. We
show that as far as K c is concerned, the hyperﬁne in-
teraction can be ignored, and the frame transformation
[9, 10, 18, 19, 20] applies basically exactly. This con-
clusion greatly simpliﬁes the description of any atomic
collision that involves hyperﬁne structures. In the case
of a collision between any two alkali-metal atoms in their
ground state, whether they are identical or not, it reduces
a complex multichannel problem to two single channel
problems. This property, along with the energy and
angular-momentum insensitivity of K c [13, 15], leads to
an accurate and complete characterization of slow col-
lisions between any two alkali-metal atoms,
including
shape resonances, Feshbach resonances, practically all
partial waves of interest, and over an energy-range of
hundreds of millikelvins, by four parameters for atoms
with identical nuclei, and ﬁve parameters for diﬀerent
atoms or diﬀerent isotopes of the same atom. To be more
speciﬁc, the four parameters can be taken as the singlet s
wave scattering length a0S, the triplet s wave scattering
length a0T , the C6 coeﬃcient for the long-range van der
C6/r6, and the atomic hyperﬁne split-
Waals potential
ting ∆EHF
(The reduced mass µ, which is also needed,
is not counted as a parameter since it is always ﬁxed and
well-known). For diﬀerent atoms or diﬀerent isotopes of
the same atom, we need another hyperﬁne splitting for
a total of ﬁve parameters. These results also prepare us
for future analytic representations of multichannel cold
collisions, when we restrict ourselves to a smaller range
of energies.

energy associated with a fragmentation channel i. As an
example, for the scattering of two alkali-metal atoms in
their ground state, the fragmentation channels in the ab-
sence of any external magnetic ﬁeld are characterized by
the F F coupling of reference [9]; diﬀerences in thresh-
old energies originate from atom hyperﬁne interaction;
ni = 6 corresponds to the van der Waals interaction; and
r0, with an order of magnitude around 30 a.u., corre-
sponds to the range of exchange interaction.

Before enforcing the physical boundary condition
(namely the condition that a wave function has to be
ﬁnite everywhere) at inﬁnity, Eqs. (2) have N linearly

gular momentum li at distances much smaller than the
length scale βni = (2µCni /¯h2)1/(ni−2) associated with
the long-range interaction (see Appendix A and refer-
ences [13, 15]).

Equation (4) deﬁnes the short-range K matrix K c. It
has a dimension equal to the total number of channels,
N , and encapsulates all the short-range physics. The K c
matrix can either be obtained from numerical calcula-
tions (see Appendix B) or be inferred from other physical
quantities such as the singlet and the triplet scattering
lengths, as discussed later in the article.

At energies where all N channels are open, the solu-
tions given by Eq. (4) already satisfy the physical bound-
ary conditions at inﬁnity. Using the asymptotic behav-
iors of reference functions f c and gc at large r (see Ap-
pendix A and reference [16]), it is easy to show from

the scattering amplitudes, the diﬀerential cross sections,

It is worth noting that Eq. (6) preserve the form of
Eq. (5). Thus the eﬀect of closed channels is simply to
introduce an energy dependence, through χc, into the
eﬀective K c matrix, K c
ef f , for the open channels. In par-
ticular, the bare (unshifted) locations of Feshbach reso-
nances, if there are any, are determined by the solutions

They are locations of would-be bound states if the closed
channels are not coupled to the open channels. The same
equation also gives the bound spectrum of true bound
states, at energies where all channels are closed.

This completes our summary of MAQDT. It is com-
pletely rigorous with no approximations involved. The
theory is easily incorporated into any numerical calcula-
tions (see Appendix B). The diﬀerence from the standard
approach is that one matches the numerical wave func-
tion to the solutions of the long-range potential to extract
K c, instead of matching to the free-particle solutions to
extract K directly. This procedure converges at a much
smaller r = r0, the range of the exchange interaction,
than methods that match to the free-particle solutions.
Furthermore, since the propagation of the wave function
from r0 to inﬁnity is done analytically, through the Z c
matrix for open channels and χc function for closed chan-
nels, there is no diﬃculty in treating shape resonances
right at or very close to the threshold. This improved
convergence and stability does not however fully illus-
trate the power of MAQDT formulation and is not the
focus of this article. Instead, we focus here on the simple
parameterization of slow atomic collisions with hyperﬁne
structures made possible by MAQDT. The result also
lays the ground work for future analytic representations
of cold collisions.

III. SIMPLIFIED PARAMETERIZATION WITH
FRAME TRANSFORMATION

Equations (5)-(7), and (9) already provide a param-
eterization of slow-atom collisions and diatomic bound
spectra in terms of the elements of the K c matrix. For
alkali-metal atoms in their ground state, where the mul-
tichannel nature arises from the hyperﬁne interaction, or
a combination of hyperﬁne and Zeeman interactions for
scattering in a magnetic ﬁeld, this parameterization can
be simpliﬁed much further by taking advantage of a frame
transformation [9, 10, 18, 19, 20].

At energies comparable to, or smaller than the atomic
hyperﬁne and/or Zeeman splitting, one faces the di-
chotomy that the hyperﬁne and/or Zeeman interaction,
while weak compared to the typical atomic interaction
energy, is suﬃciently strong that the physical K matrix
(This
changes signiﬁcantly over a hyperﬁne splitting.
is reﬂected in the very existence of Feshbach resonances
[1, 2] and states with binding energies comparable to or
small than the hyperﬁne splitting.) As a result, the frame
transformation does not apply directly to the physical K
matrix itself, and is generally a bad approximation even
for the K 0 matrix of reference [9]. It was this recogni-
tion that ﬁrst motivated the solutions for the long-range
potentials [16, 17].

This dichotomy is easily and automatically resolved
with the introduction of the short range K matrix K c.
The solution is simply to ignore the hyperﬁne and/or
Zeeman interaction only at small distances and treat it
exactly at large distances. For r < r0, the atomic in-
teraction is of the order of the typical electronic energy.
Thus as far as K c, which converges at r0, is concerned,
the hyperﬁne and/or Zeeman interaction can be safely

In this approximation, the K c matrix in the

fragmentation channels can be obtained from the K c ma-
trix in the condensation channels, namely the channels
that diagonalize the short-range interactions, by a frame
transformation.

For simplicity, we restrict ourselves here to the case
of zero external magnetic ﬁeld, although the theory can
readily be generalized to include a magnetic ﬁeld. The
fragmentation channels are the F F coupled channels
characterized by quantum numbers [9]:

(α1L1S1J1I1F1)A(α2L2S2J2I2F2)BF lT MT ,

where F results from the coupling of F1 and F2; l is
the relative orbital angular momentum of the center-of-
masses of the two atoms. T represents the total angular
momentum, and MT is its projection on a space-ﬁxed
axis [9].

Provided that the oﬀ-diagonal

second-order spin-
orbital coupling [22] can be ignored, a good approxima-
tion for lighter alkali-metal atoms, or more generally, for
any physical processes that are allowed by the exchange
interaction, the condensation channels can be taken as
the LS coupled channels characterized by quantum num-
bers [9]:

(α1L1S1I1)A(α2L2S2I2)BLl
= L + l is the total orbital angular momentum.
where
S = S1 + S2 is the total electron spin. I = I1 + I2 is the
+ S is the total angular
total nuclear spin. And K =

Ignoring hyperﬁne interactions, as argued earlier, the
K c matrix in F F -coupled channels, labeled by index i or

where K c(LS) is the K c matrix computed in the LS cou-
pling with the hyperﬁne interactions ignored. The most
general form of frame transformation Ujβ is given by
Eq. (49) of reference [9]. For collision between any two
atoms with zero orbital angular momentum, L1 = L2 =
L = 0, including of course any two alkali-metal atoms in
their ground states, the frame transformation simpliﬁes
to

We emphasize that to the degree that the hyperﬁne in-
teraction in a slow atomic collision can be approximated
by atomic hyperﬁne interactions, as has always been as-
sumed [2], the frame transformation given by Eq. (10)
should be regarded as exact. If the hyperﬁne interaction
inside r0, the range of the exchange interaction, cannot
be ignored, the true molecular hyperﬁne interaction [23]
would have to be used. Inclusion of atomic hyperﬁne in-
teractions inside r0 is simply another approximation, and
an unnecessary complication, that is of the same order of
accuracy as ignoring it completely. In other words, any
real improvement over the frame transformation has to
require a better treatment of molecular hyperﬁne inter-
actions [23]. A similar statement is also applicable to the
Zeeman interaction.

The applicability of the frame transformation greatly
simpliﬁes the description of any slow atomic collision
with hyperﬁne structures. For alkali-metal atoms in
their ground state, and ignoring oﬀ-diagonal second-
order spin-orbital coupling [22], it reduces a complex mul-
tichannel problem to two single channel problems, one
for the singlet S = 0, and one for the triplet, S = 1,
with their respective single-channel K c [13, 14] denoted
T (ǫ, li), respectively. The K c matrix
by K c
in the LS coupling, K c(LS), is diagonal with diagonal ele-
ments given by either K c
S or K c
T [9]. Ignoring the energy
and the angular momentum dependences of K c
S(ǫ, li) and
K c
T (ǫ, li) [13, 15], they become simply two parameters
S = K c
K c
T (0, 0), which are related to
the singlet and the triplet s wave scattering lengths by

tering in the ground state. With K c(LS), and therefore
K c, being parameterized by two parameters, a complete
parameterization of alkali-metal scattering requires only
two, or three, more parameters including C6, which de-
termined the length and energy scales for the long range
interaction, and the atomic hyperﬁne splitting ∆EHF
,
which characterizes the strength of atomic hyperﬁne in-
teraction and also determines the channel energies.

a

We note here that our formulation ignores the weak
magnetic dipole-dipole interaction [22, 25].
It is im-
portant only for processes, such as the dipolar relax-
ation, that are not allowed by the exchange interaction.
Such processes can be incorporated perturbatively after
a MAQDT treatment [11]. We also note that for pro-
cesses, such as the spin relaxation of Cs, for which the
oﬀ-diagonal second-order spin-orbital coupling is impor-
tant [22, 26], a diﬀerent choice of condensation channels,
similar to the JJ-coupled channels of reference [9], would
be required. The resulting description is similar concep-
tually, but involves more parameters [22, 26].

F1 =

the fact that K c

The agreements between the MAQDT parameteriza-
tion and close-coupling calculations are excellent, exact
for all practical purposes,
in all cases. Conceptually,
these results illustrate that through a proper MAQDT
formulation, atomic collision over a wide range of en-
ergies (300 mK compared to the Doppler cooling limit
of about 0.2 mK for 23Na), with complex structures in-
cluding Feshbach and shape resonances, and for diﬀerent
partial waves, can all be described by parameters that
we often associate with the s wave scattering at zero en-
ergy only, namely the singlet and the triplet scattering
lengths.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, a multichannel, angular-momentum-
insensitive, quantum-defect theory (MAQDT) for slow
atomic collisions has been presented. We believe it to
be the optimal formulation for purposes including ex-
act numerical calculation, parameterization, and ana-
lytic representation. We have shown that by dealing
with the short-range K matrix K c, the frame transfor-
mation becomes basically exact, which greatly simpliﬁes
the description of any slow atomic collision with hyper-
ﬁne structures. As an example, we have shown that
even a simplest parameterization with four parameters,
in which the energy and the l dependence of K c
S and
K c
T are completely ignored, reproduces the close-coupling
calculations for 23Na atoms over a wide range of energies
basically exactly. The eﬀect of an external magnetic ﬁeld,
which is not considered in this article, is easily incorpo-
rated as it simply requires another frame transformation
[10].

The concepts and the main constructs of the theory

can be generalized to other scattering processes including
ion-atom scattering and atom-atom scattering in excited
states. The key diﬀerence will be in the long-range in-
teraction [c.f. Eq. (3)]. In addition to possibly diﬀerent
long-range exponent ni (such as ni = 4 for ion-atom scat-
tering), there may also be long-range oﬀ-diagonal cou-
pling that will have to be treated diﬀerently.

Finally, we expect that if we restrict ourselves to a
smaller range of energies, of the order of (¯h2/2µ)(1/β6)2
(about 1 mK for 23Na), a number of analytic results, sim-
ilar to the single-channel results of references [5] and [6],
can be derived even for the complex multichannel prob-
lem of alkali-metal collisions. These results may, in par-
ticular, lead to a more general and more rigorous param-
eterization of magnetic Feshbach resonances (see, e.g.,
references [12, 30] for some recent works in this area).

The Z c(n)(ǫs, l) and W c(n)(ǫs, l) matrices, for ǫ > 0 and
ǫ < 0, respectively, describe the propagation of a wave
Cn/rn potential from small to large dis-
function in a
tances, or vice versa. They are universal functions of the
scaled energy ǫs with their functional forms determined
only by the exponent n of the long-range potential and
the l quantum number. The Cn coeﬃcient and the re-
duced mass play a role only in determining the length
and energy scales.

The Z c(n) matrix for n = 6 is given in reference [14].
The χc(n)
(ǫs) function for n = 6 is given in reference
[13]. They are derived from Eq. (A7) and the asymptotic
behaviors of the f 0 and g0 pair given in reference [16].

Let F (r) be the matrix, with elements Fij (r), repre-
senting any N linearly independent solutions of the close-

coupling equation, and F ′(r) be its corresponding deriva-
tive [Each column of F (r) corresponds to one solution
r0, F can always be written as
through Eq. (1)]. For r

The matrices A and B can be obtain, e.g., from knowing
F (r) and F ′(r) at one particular r

r0. Speciﬁcally

A = (πβn/2)[gc′(r)F (r)

(B4)
In an actual numerical calculation, which can be imple-
mented using a number of diﬀerent methods [32], the
right-hand-side (RHS) of this equation is evaluated at
progressively greater r until K c converges to a constant
matrix to a desired accuracy. This procedure also pro-
vides a numerical deﬁnition of r0, namely it is the radius
at which the RHS of Eq.(B4) becomes a r-independent
constant matrix.

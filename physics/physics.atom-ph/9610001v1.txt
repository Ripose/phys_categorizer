Abstract

Using the exact path integral solution for the damped harmonic oscillator

it is shown that in general there does not exist an exact dissipative Liouville

operator describing the dynamics of the oscillator for arbitrary initial bath

preparations. Exact non-stationary Liouville operators can be found only

for particular preparations. Three physically meaningful examples are exam-

ined. An exact new master equation is derived for thermal initial conditions.

Second, the Liouville operator governing the time-evolution of equilibrium

correlations is obtained. Third, factorizing initial conditions are studied. Ad-

ditionally, one can show that there are approximate Liouville operators inde-

pendent of the initial preparation describing the long time dynamics under

appropriate conditions. The general form of these approximate master equa-

tions is derived and the coeﬃcients are determined for special cases of the

bath spectral density including the Ohmic, Drude and weak coupling cases.

The connection with earlier work is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently the problem of the reduced dynamics of a quantum system in contact with a

reservoir has gained renewed interest [1–3]. While the foundations of quantum dissipative

processes were layed already in the sixties [4], this early work was mainly concerned with

weakly damped systems and has relied on the Born and Markov approximations. In this

conventional approach the dynamics of the dissipative quantum system is described in terms

of quantum master or Langevin equations. Important progress beyond the limitations of the

weak coupling approach was made in the eighties, in particular path integral techniques were

shown to be powerful means to describe quantum dissipative systems [5]. This has lead to

unexpected new results, as for instance the non-exponential decay of correlation functions

in the low temperature range [6,7], not directly available within the conventional master

equation approach.

The new insight gained also provided a basis for profound critique [1,3,8,9] of concepts de-

veloped in the context of the quantum master equation approach such as complete positivity

or the quantum regression theorem. However, the results of the path integral approach were

rarely used to derive improved master equations valid in the range of strong damping and/or

low temperatures. In this paper we shall address this problem for the ubiquitous quantum

dissipative system, the damped harmonic oscillator. Based on available exact results [10] we

derive new generalized quantum master equations describing the exact relaxation of mean

values and the time evolution of equilibrium correlation functions. Whenever appropriate,

the new results will be confronted and compared with earlier ﬁndings.

More speciﬁcally, the article is organized as follows. In the following section the micro-

scopic model of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a harmonic bath is introduced. The exact

time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the oscillator [10] will brieﬂy be summarized.

In section III we examine whether the exact time evolution of the density matrix is compat-

ible with a generalized quantum master equation with a time dependent Liouville operator.

It is shown that in general there is no Liouville operator independent of the initial prepa-

2

ration. In section IV we study speciﬁc types of initial preparations. Exact time-dependent

Liouville operators describing the time evolution of thermal initial conditions and of cor-

relation functions are derived. In the classical limit these Liouville operators are shown to

reduce to the Adelman Fokker-Planck operator [11]. We also examine the case of factorizing

initial conditions.

In section V we investigate particular types of damping leading to a time evolution of the

density matrix governed approximately by a time-independent Liouville operator. Earlier

results by Talkner [9] and by Haake and Reibold [12] are recovered. We discuss in detail the

limit of a weakly damped oscillator and derive a generalization of the Agarwal equation [13].

Additional time coarse-graining is shown to lead to the quantum-optical master equation by

Weidlich and Haake [14]. Finally in section VI we present our conclusions.

is the damping kernel. The dynamics of the density matrix of the entire system (oscillator

and bath) is given by

W (t) = exp(−iHt/¯h)W (0) exp(iHt/¯h),

from where the reduced density matrix of the oscillator is obtained by tracing out the bath

modes

ρ(t) = TrRW (t).

The path integral technique allows for a complete solution to this problem for a large class

of initial states. Since the derivation is expounded in [10], we merely state the result

i, ¯q, ¯q′) is the so-called preparation function deﬁning the initial non-equilibrium

state W (0) as a modiﬁcation of the equilibrium state Wβ = exp(−βH)/Tr exp(−βH) in the

subspace of the oscillator. This modiﬁcation can be produced by operators Oj, O′

j that act

upon the particle only leaving the reservoir coordinates unchanged

We then have

with complex parameter Lc(t) and complex matrices X(t), Y(t) and Z(t). Without loss

of generality we may put Xrx(t) = Xxr(t) and Zrx(t) = Zxr(t). Hence, there are eleven

time-dependent functions in the ansatz (28). Using (8), (12),(13), and (28) to write the left

hand and right hand sides of (27) in explicit form, we ﬁnd that a master equation exists for

arbitrary preparation functions provided that 15 ordinary diﬀerential equations are fulﬁlled.

Three of these, obtained by comparing the coeﬃcients of r2

f , rf ri, r2

i , read

0 = Zrr(t) + Xxx(t)f1(t)2 − iYrx(t)f1(t),

0 = −iYrx(t) + 2Xxx(t)f1(t),

0 = Xxx(t)f4(t)2.

Inserting the solution Xxx(t) = Yrx(t) = Zrr(t) = 0 into the 12 remaining equations, one ﬁnds

that the conditions obtained by comparing the coeﬃcients of 1 and rf xi imply Lc(t) = Yrr(t).

Taking this into account, we are left with the following set of 11 equations:

˙f1(t) = 2iXxr(t)f1(t)2 + [Yrr(t) + Yxx(t)]f1(t) + 2iZxr(t)

˙f2(t) = 2iXxr(t)f4(t)f3(t)

˙f3(t) = [Yrr(t) + 2iXxr(t)f1(t)] f3(t)

Since only seven functions of the ansatz (28) remain to be determined, the set (29)-(39) will

be seen to have no solution in general. To demonstrate this explicitly, let us ﬁrst disregard

the equations (36)-(39) which stem from comparing coeﬃcients involving the coordinates ¯x

and ¯r of the preparation function. The remaining set of equations (29)-(35) has a unique

solution and, the resulting Liouville operator can be written in the form

To see this one ﬁrst notes that (30), (31), and (33) give

Xrr(t) = Yrr(t) = 0 and Xxr(t) = i/2.

The remaining four functions are then readily determined. For later convenience they are

expressed in terms of the four functions introduced in (40) which are given by

γq(t) = −2iZxr(t) =

Inserting Xxr(t) = i/2 and Yrr(t) = 0 into (36)-(39), it is readily seen that (36) and (38) are

already satisﬁed. However, (37) and (39) are only fulﬁlled provided that

X(t) = ˙G(t)S(t) − G(t) ˙S(t),

Y (t) = G(t) ¨S(t) − ˙G(t) ˙S(t).

¨S(t) + γp(t) ˙S(t) + γq(t)S(t) = 0,

···
S(t) + γp(t) ¨S(t) + γq(t) ˙S(t) = 0.

G(t) = t + O(t3)

where c is a real constant. Clearly, this condition, which is equivalent to Onsager’s regression

hypothesis [3], is never met exactly whatever the form of the damping kernel. To see this

explicitly we note that the Taylor series of S(t) and G(t) start according to

On the other hand, in the case ˙γp(t) = 0, the condition (46) is only fulﬁlled if γp(t) and γq(t)

are both independent of time. Further S(t) must be of the form

where d1 and d2 are complex constants and λ1/2 = γp/2 ± i

γq − γ2

p/4. Moreover, from (42)

we see that γp(t) is constant provided that G(t) is of the form

q

S(t) = d1e−λ1t + d2e−λ2t

(t ≥ 0),

G(t) = c1e−λ1t + c2e−λ2t

(t ≥ 0),

where c1 and c2 are complex constants. It is now easily seen that (50) and (51) never hold

exactly except for γp = 0, which means in the absence of damping. Hence there is no exact

master equation for the damped harmonic oscillator with a Liouville operator L independent

of the preparation function.

In the remainder of this work we ﬁrst consider speciﬁc initial preparations for which the

time evolution is described exactly by a time-dependent Liouville operator. We then give

examples for approximate Liouville operators valid for particular types of damping.

IV. LIOUVILLE OPERATORS FOR SPECIAL INITIAL PREPARATIONS

In the previous section we have shown that there is no exact Liouville operator which

is independent of the preparation function. However, for certain preparations the set of

equations (29)-(39) which determine the time-dependend parameters in L can be reduced

allowing for an exact solution. In the sequel three types of initial states will be considered.

A. Thermal initial condition

Let us ﬁrst consider a system that is initially in a state

hq|W (0)|q′i = r(q, q′)hq|Wβ|q′i

(52)

where r(q, q′) is an arbitrary function of q and q′. This initial condition allows in (9) only for

operators Oj and O′

j that are diagonal in position space. It can be used to describe initial

states resulting from position measurements but excludes measurements of velocities or

variables that couple to the position and the momentum. Following Hakim and Ambegaokar

[19] we call (52) a thermal initial condition. Inspection of (10) shows that the corresponding

preparation function is given by

λ(xi, ri, ¯x, ¯r) = r(xi, ri)δ(¯x − xi)δ(¯r − ri).

(53)

This form of the preparation function has the consequence that only the diﬀerence of (37)

and (32) and likewise the diﬀerence of (39) and (34) must be fulﬁlled. Since (36) and (38)

are again satisﬁed as a consequence of (41), there is indeed an exact solution

γq(t) =

γp(t) =

˙G(t) ¨S(t) − ¨G(t) ˙S(t)
˙G(t)S(t) − G(t) ˙S(t)

valid for a large class of initial states. Using the relations

This function contains complete information about equilibrium correlation functions.

P (q1, q2, t, q3, q4) satisﬁes an exact master equation. To see this we ﬁrst note that an

equilibrium correlation function may be calculated in the following way [10]. One propagates

the initial reduced “density matrix” ρB(0) = Bρβ and takes the expectation value of A after

time t. Hence,

hA(t)Bi = tr [AρB(t)] =

dqf dq′

f A(q′

f , qf )ρB(qf , q′

f , t)

(70)

where tr denotes the trace over the Hilbert space of the oscillator. Since the initial reduced

“density matrix” Bρβ corresponds to the “density matrix” BWβ of the entire system, the

preparation function reads

λB(qi, q′

i, ¯q, ¯q′) = B(qi, ¯q)δ(¯q′ − q′

i).

over y, we are left with an expression containing S(t) and G(t) only in the combination

S(t) − i¯hG(t)/2M = C(t). One ﬁnds

have introduced N(t) = hq2i2 − C(t)2. In view of the δ function in (71) there are again

fewer conditions that must be satisﬁed by the time-dependent coeﬃcients of the Liouville

operator. In fact, it is easily seen that

Z

This means that we can view ˜P (pf , qf , t, pi, qi) as a quantum mechanical generalization of

the classical joint probability. The Wigner form of the master equation (78), which is again

a generalized Fokker-Planck equation, was ﬁrst derived by Schramm, Jung, and Grabert

[20] on the basis of phenomenological reasoning. Note, that the time-dependent coeﬃcients

are complex. However, in the classical limit they become real, since the imaginary part of

C(t) vanishes, and the generalized Fokker-Planck equation reduces again to the Adelman

equation.

C. Factorizing initial preparation

In earlier work it has been frequently assumed [12,17,21,22] that the initial density matrix

W0 of the entire system factorizes according to

W0 = ρ0WR

(82)

where ρ0 is the density matrix of the oscillator, while WR = ZR exp(−βHR) is the canonical

density matrix of the unperturbed heat bath. Within our approach this situation cannot be

described by a special form of the preparation function λ(qi, q′

i, ¯q, ¯q′), however, factorizing

initial states are easily gained by disregarding contributions coming from the imaginary time

path integral (see [10] for details). The time evolution of the density matrix is then given

by

R±±(t). The quadratic ansatz (28) now leads to equations (29)-(35) with the functions

R±±(t) replaced by R±±

FV (t). There are no equations replacing (36)-(39) since oscillator and

bath are uncorrelated in the initial state. This set allows for a solution by the time-dependent

parameters

The resulting master equation is equivalent to the result by Haake and Reibold [12,23] who

derived it directly from microscopic dynamics. Their formulas for Kq(t) and Kp(t) contain

frequency integrals that may be evaluated to obtain (87). Later, this equation was rederived

by Hu, Paz and Zhang [22] from the path integral representation. The equivalence can most

easily be seen using the simpliﬁed derivation given by Paz [25].

We mention that for factorizing initial conditions the classical limit does not yield the

Adelman equation [24]. The generalized Fokker-Planck operator diﬀers by terms that persist

over times of the order of the relaxation time. This means that switching on the interaction

with the bath at t = 0 pathologically aﬀects also the long time behavior of the system. Usu-

ally, the oscillator and the bath are integral parts of the same system and the factorization

assumption is not appropriate.

V. LIOUVILLE OPERATORS FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF DAMPING

So far we have searched for exact master equations. Let us now turn to the question

whether for particular types of damping the dynamics may be described in terms of ap-

proximate Liouville operators valid for arbitrary preparation functions. Thus, we have to

ﬁnd circumstances under which S(t) and G(t) take the forms (50) and (51). Using (42)

we see that in this case the Liouville operator (40) is time independent and the coeﬃcients

Dp(t) = Dp and Dq(t) = Dq read

hp2i
M 2

Dq = γqhq2i −

Dp = γp

hp2i
M 2 .

(90)

Note that this result is independent of the coeﬃcients c1, c2, d1, d2 in (50) and (51). The

Wigner transform of the density matrix then obeys equation (60) with time independent

coeﬃcients γq and γp. This result is in accordance with the ﬁndings of Talkner [9] on

the most general form of a Liouville operator in Wigner form compatible with the correct

equilibrium expectation values.

17

To see explicitly when conditions (50) and (51) hold, we ﬁrst investigate the consequences

of (51). By virtue of Ehrenfest’s theorem G(t) is purely classical [6], since it is related to

the response function

describing the mean non-equilibrium displacement in response to an applied force. Hence

(51) implies that the classical equation of motion is solved by a sum of two exponentials.

This means essentially Ohmic damping.

For strictly Ohmic damping ˆγ(z) = γ and condition (51) holds exactly. We have

where λ1/2 = γ/2 ± i

0 − γ2/4 and c1/2 = ∓(λ1 − λ2)−1. Thus γp = γ and γq = ω2
ω2

0. We

still have to examine whether S(t) fulﬁlls (50). To this purpose it is useful to note that (25)

S(t) = d1e−λ1t + d2e−λ2t − Γ(t),

18

The latter relations follow from the fact that S(t) is symmetric and G(t) anti-symmetric.

Of course, (93) is just the familiar ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Now, performing the

inverse Fourier transform we ﬁnd [6]

This means that we have to ﬁnd conditions under which Γ(t) may be disregarded. Now

Γ(t) decays at least as exp(−νt), where ν ≡ ν1 = 2π/kBT . Therefore, for temperatures

T ≫ ¯hγ/4πkB, we have ν ≫ Re(λ1), Re(λ2) and Γ(t) decays faster than the ﬁrst two terms

in (95). Hence for t ≫ ν−1 the last term in (95) may be disregarded and S(t) is of the form

(51). However, in the strictly Ohmic case we do not have a well-deﬁned Liouville operator

since the sum (26) for hp2i is logarithmically divergent leading to associated divergences

of the coeﬃcients Dq and Dp in (90). To avoid this divergence we have to take the high

frequency behavior of the damping coeﬃcient into account which implies in realistic cases

A more realistic behavior of the damping coeﬃcient is modeled by

often referred to as Drude damping. Using (25) we then ﬁnd

This result holds also in the overdamped case where η becomes imaginary. To calculate S(t)

we have to evaluate the inverse Fourier transform of (93) by contour integration. Using (99)

From these results we see that S(t) and G(t) are of the forms (50) and (51), respectively, if

In view of (108) this gives [27]

γ/ωD = 2α/δ − 8(α/δ)2 + O((α/δ)3).

Hence, it is natural to use γ/ωD as small parameter to determine the roots of (101). Up to

These relations are valid for arbitrary ratios of γ and ω0. Also ωD/ω0 is not necessarily

large. As a consequence of this analysis we ﬁnd that only under the conditions

and

S(t) may be approximated by the ﬁrst two terms in (103). Hence, for suﬃciently large

Drude cutoﬀ and suﬃciently high temperatures, kBT ≫ ¯hγ, the oscillator dynamics can be

described by an approximate Liouville operator with the coeﬃcients

The equilibrium variances can be calculated analytically [6]. In the strictly Ohmic limit

ωD → ∞, hq2i is a regular expression but hp2i diverges logarithmically. If we disregard terms

of the order ω0/ωD, γ/ωD, ν/ωD, the divergent part of hp2i is given by

(cid:18)

Hence, for the classical limit it is not suﬃcient to have ν ≫ ω0, that is kBT ≫ ¯hω0, rather

we also need γ ln(ωD/ν) ≪ ν. Thus the strictly Ohmic limit ωD → ∞ can only be taken

after the classical limit. With this sequence of limits we obtain the classical coeﬃcients

γq = ω2

0, γp = γ, Dq = 0, Dp =

.

(116)

The associated Liouville operator is equivalent to the classical Fokker-Planck operator of

the Kramers equation [28]. We stress again that the results in this section remain valid for

strong damping provided (112) is satisﬁed.

C. Weak damping with arbitrary frequency dependence

In this section we show that S(t) and G(t) always take the forms (50) and (51) in the

limit of weak damping. Let us assume that the damping kernel γ(t) has a high frequency

cutoﬀ ωc and that its Laplace transform is an analytic function in the vicinity of −iω0. We

introduce a typical damping strength by

Then the weak damping condition is

γc =

dsγ(s) cos(ω0s).

γc ≪ ω0, ωc, ν.

(117)

(118)

Apart from this γ(t) is not assumed to have additional properties.

In the limit considered one can determine the poles of ˆG(z) from (25) perturbatively. To

ﬁrst order in γc the poles are

with residues in zeroth order. Higher order corrections would depend on the speciﬁc form

of ˆγ(z) but need not be determined because the diﬀusion constants (90) are independent of

the residues. Thus, in the weak damping limit G(t) is of the form (51). From (93) we see

that ˜S(ω) has the same poles as ˜G(ω) and, in addition, poles at iνn (n integer). As shown

above, we can disregard the terms coming from the poles at iνn for times greater than the

thermal relaxation time ν−1. Thus, S(t) is eﬀectively of the form (50). Inserting λ1/2 into

(90), we ﬁnd to leading order in the damping strength

This general weak coupling master equation is given in terms of four dissipation coeﬃcients.

γs leads to a frequency shift and may be absorbed by renormalizing ω0. γc is the classical

damping coeﬃcient. The coeﬃcients Kc and Ks depend on the temperature. While Kc

equals Mγc/¯h times the average energy of a quantum oscillator of frequency ω0, Ks depends

on the speciﬁc form of ˆγ(z) and can be calculated analytically only in certain cases. One of

these is the Drude model. Then the moments γc/s and Kc/s are readily evaluated to read

(128)

Hence, the new master equation (124) is a generalization of the Agarwal equation.

D. Connection to Lindblad theory

The approximate time-independent Liouville operators studied above describe the dy-

namics after the decay of fast transients. Markovian Liouville operators like these are often

24

discussed in the context of Lindblad theory [29]. This theory establishes the most general

form of generators L of dissipative quantum dynamics ˙ρ(t) = Lρ(t) preserving the positivity

of density operators. The Lindblad master equation reads

˙ρ(t) = −

[ ˜H, ρ(t)] +

[Liρ(t), L+

i ] + [Li, ρ(t)L+
i ]

(129)

where Ll are arbitrary operators and ˜H is a Hermitian operator. Using results by Sandulescu

and Scutaru [30] it is easily seen that all the above derived time-independent Liouville

operators are not of Lindblad form. This is not too astonishing since the master equations

derived hold only for times t > t0 where t0 is larger than an inverse cutoﬀ frequency and ν−1.

The short time dynamics for t <

∼ t0 reduces the density matrix to a subspace where the fast

components have decayed. The Markovian master equation holds within this subspace only,

while Lindblad theory requires validity for any reduced density matrix. This is of course not

necessary as has been emphasized again recently [1,31].

However, we will show that in the weak coupling limit further coarse-graining will result

in a Lindblad operator. To this aim we ﬁrst write the weak-coupling master equation (124)

in the form

˙ρ(t) = Lρ(t) = L0ρ(t) + γL1ρ(t).

In terms of the usual creation and annihilation operators a†, a we have

For weak damping and times t ≪ γ−1 the operator eLs in the integrand may be replaced by

Then, by performing the time integral, the oﬀ-diagonal terms (n 6= m) are seen to be

smaller than the diagonal terms by a factor (ω0t)−1. This means that in the time window

The density matrix (140) coincides with the solution of the master equation

for

(143)

Thus, within the time-window ω−1

0 ≪ t ≪ γ−1 the two operators L0 + γL1 and L0 + γ ˜L1 give
the same dynamics. The operator ˜L1 may be evaluated further. It is seen that only “non-

rotating” terms containing equal numbers of creation and annihilation operators survive the

coarse-graining in time. The resulting master equation

was ﬁrst derived by Weidlich and Haake [14] from a microscopic model for the damped

motion of a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a cavity. The generator deﬁned

by this master equation is of Lindblad form. However, the resulting mean value equations

violate Ehrenfest’s theorem, in particular

(145)

This is due to the fact that on the coarse-grained time scale ∆t ≫ ω−1

the variables p(t)/Mω0

and q(t) exchange identity frequently and only a time averaged version of the mean value

equations must be obeyed.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Based on results of the path integral technique we have examined quantum master equa-

tions for the damped harmonic oscillator. A new exact generalized master equation de-

scribing the relaxation of initial thermal conditions was derived. This equation was shown

to be a quantum mechanical generalization of Adelman’s Fokker-Planck equation. We also

27

have given an exact Liouville operator describing the time evolution of equilibrium correla-

tion functions which likewise reduces to the Adelman Fokker-Planck operator in the classical

limit. The fact, that two diﬀerent quantum generalizations of the Adelman operator must be

used for the relaxation of expectation values and the regression of ﬂuctuations is intimately

connected with the failure of the Onsager regression hypothesis in the quantum regime. In-

deed, the two Liouville operators (56) and (76) are only identical if S(t) is proportional to

G(t).

Apart from these exact results we have studied in detail the range of parameters leading to

quantum master equations with time-independent generator. In the case of strong damping

a time-independent Liouville operator is obtained approximately for essentially frequency-

independent damping. However, strictly Ohmic damping is ill-behaved in the quantum case,

and the appropriate generalization of the classical Fokker-Planck process is given by a low-

frequency Ohmic model with high frequency cutoﬀ such as the Drude model. This is not too

amazing since already in the classical limit the Adelman operator becomes time-independent

only for frequency-independent damping.

On the other hand, in the case of weak damping the detailed frequency dependence of

the damping coeﬃcient is unimportant. We have derived a new generalized master equation

valid for arbitrary weak damping as long as the sine and cosine moments of the damping

kernel exist. The new weak-coupling master equation is more general than the well-known

Agarwal equation. We have explained why the Liouville operator is not of Lindblad form.

However, time coarse-graining leads to a generator of Lindblad form. The resulting coarse-

grained master equation was found to be the Weidlich-Haake equation also known as the

quantum optical master equation. Due to the time coarse-graining only a time-averaged

version of the mean value equation is obeyed leading to an apparent contradiction with the

Ehrenfest theorem.

In summary, we have derived several new generalized master equations for the damped

quantum oscillator for various cases of interest. In view of the new results earlier ﬁndings

were put in proper perspective.

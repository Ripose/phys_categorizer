Abstract

We report the ﬁrst detailed decay studies of trapped metastable (2S)
hydrogen. By two-photon excitation of ultracold H samples, we have pro-
duced clouds of at least 5 × 107 magnetically trapped 2S atoms at densi-
ties greater than 4 × 1010 cm−3 and temperatures below 100 µK. At these
densities and temperatures, two-body inelastic collisions of metastables are
evident. Experimental values for the total two-body loss rate constant are
K2 = 1.8+1.8
−0.5 ×10−9 cm3/s at 230 µK.
These results are in the range of recent theoretical calculations for the total
2S-2S inelastic rate constant. The metastable clouds were excited in a gas
of ground state (1S) hydrogen with peak densities reaching 7 × 1013 cm−3.
From the one-body component of the metastable decay, we derive experimen-
tal upper limits for K12, the rate constant for loss due to inelastic 1S-2S
collisions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ability to create large clouds of metastable (2S) H atoms in a magnetic trap makes it
possible to study the rich collisional physics of cold metastable H. In an encounter between
two metastables, the possible outcomes include Penning ionization, the formation of molec-
ular ions, excitation transfer to short-lived 2P states, and hyperﬁne transitions [1,2]. If the
2S atoms are generated from a background 1S gas, then several 1S-2S collision processes
may also occur. Though these states of H are among the simplest atomic states in nature,
an accurate description of their inelastic collisions at low energies remains a theoretical
challenge [1,3,4].

At low temperatures, the rate of quenching collisions between metastables is small enough
to allow dense (> 1010 cm−3) 2S clouds to exist for tens of milliseconds, which is an ap-
preciable fraction of the 122 ms natural lifetime of the 2S state. Such a cloud can serve
as an atom source for precision spectroscopy of transitions originating in the 2S state. In
particular, the absolute frequencies of transitions from the 2S to higher-lying states can be
combined with the well-known 1S-2S interval to simultaneously determine the 1S Lamb
shift (a sensitive test of QED) and the Rydberg constant (which relates several more fun-
damental constants) [5–7]. Taking advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio possible in a
cold, trapped sample, spectroscopy of metastable H may lead to a signiﬁcant advance in
accuracy for the determination of these quantities [8].

Cold metastable H is also potentially interesting for “quantum atom optics” experiments
involving single-atom detection. The large (10 eV) internal energy of a 2S atom is easily
registered by an ionizing collision on an electron-multiplying detector, or by detecting the
Lyman-α photon emitted at a surface or other localized electric ﬁeld. As demonstrated
already with metastable noble gases, single-atom detection allows experiments involving
atom-atom correlations, atom interferometry, or atom holography [9–11]. A metastable
beam ejected from a trapped H sample, potentially much brighter than other cold metastable
beams to date, may be a useful source for quantum atom optics research.

After improving our apparatus at MIT, we have been able to generate metastable H
clouds which are larger and longer-lived than in our previous work [12,13]. In this paper, we
report results from decay studies of trapped 2S clouds, conducted at temperatures ranging
from a few mK to below 100 µK. These results include the ﬁrst experimental determinations
of the 2S-2S two-body loss rate constant K2 and upper limits for the 1S-2S inelastic rate
constant K12. In the case of K2, we have observed a temperature dependence below 230 µK
which is not predicted in the current theory for cold metastable H collisions [14]. This work
serves as a stepping stone to high-resolution spectroscopy experiments which probe funda-
mental physics. Knowledge of metastable collision parameters may also be instrumental in
the development of single-atom detection experiments involving H.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The methods we use for trapping and cooling atomic H in a cryogenic apparatus
(Fig. 1(a)) are described elsewhere [13,15,16]. Molecular hydrogen is dissociated in a dis-
charge chamber that is thermally anchored at one end to a dilution refrigerator and opens
to a trapping cell at the other end. Atoms in the F = 1, mF = 1 hyperﬁne state of the 1S

2

manifold are captured in a Ioﬀe-Pritchard magnetic trap [17], initially 500 mK deep. With
typical aspect ratios between 100:1 and 400:1, the cloud is shaped like a highly elongated
ellipsoid, cylindrically symmetric about the trap axis. We refer to the direction along the
trap axis as “axial” and to the perpendicular direction as “radial.”

If an atom has suﬃcient energy, it can escape over a magnetic ﬁeld saddlepoint located at
one end of the trap. The sample can be cooled to a temperature of ∼ 200 µK by progressively
lowering the saddlepoint ﬁeld, thus forcing evaporation [18]. If further cooling is desired,
rf-induced evaporation is employed to reach temperatures as low as ∼ 20 µK [19]. The
number of atoms in the trap ranges from more than 1014 after initial loading to ∼ 1010 at
the lowest temperatures. For the experiments described in this paper, the samples were not
Bose degenerate, and typical peak 1S densities ranged from 1013 cm−3 to 1014 cm−3.

To generate metastable hydrogen, we excite the two-photon 1S-2S transition with a
243 nm laser [12]. To achieve large excitation rates, typically ∼ 15 mW of laser power
is focused to a radius of ∼ 20 µm near the trap minimum. In accordance with the two-
photon selection rules, the metastables produced are in the F = 1, mF = 1 state of the
2S manifold; except for a small relativistic correction (∼ 10−4), these experience the same
magnetic trapping potential as the 1S atoms.
In the presence of a weak electric ﬁeld of
strength E, the 2S state quenches at a rate γs = 2800E2 (cm2/V2)s−1 due to Stark-mixing
with the 2P state [20]. To detect the metastables, a ﬁeld of 10 V/cm is applied, quenching
the 2S atoms in a few microseconds. A small fraction of the resulting 122 nm Lyman-
α photons are counted on a microchannel plate (MCP) detector. The metastable decay
behavior is observed by cycling through a series of diﬀerent wait times between excitation
and quench pulses (Fig. 1(b)). During the trap lifetime of the ground state sample, typically
several minutes, we can make many 2S decay measurements. Samples of diﬀering initial 2S
density are obtained by stepping the laser frequency across the resonance.

For the measurements discussed here, the detection eﬃciency was approximately 2×10−6.
This was calibrated using a 230 µK sample where the initial number of 1S atoms was
known from bolometric density measurements [13] and the trap geometry. The sample was
depleted by resonant 1S-2S excitation and subsequent quenching to an untrapped state.
With appropriate corrections, the detection eﬃciency can be inferred from the total number
of signal photons counted and the initial number of atoms [21]. The corrections account
for other loss mechanisms, for the branching ratio back to the trapped ground state, and
for reabsorption (“radiation trapping”) of the Lyman-α photons by the ground state cloud.
The photons emitted by the quenched metastables have a frequency which is detuned from
a 100 MHz-wide 1S-2P absorption resonance by only 1.1 GHz, and at the densities achieved
in our experiments, the eﬀects of radiation trapping are signiﬁcant. Using Monte Carlo
simulations of Lyman-α propagation in experimentally realistic cloud geometries, it was
determined that typically ∼ 30% of potential signal photons are absorbed and scattered in
the atom cloud [21]. Other factors, such as the small detection solid angle (1.1 × 10−2 sr),
the transmission of two MgF2 windows between the atoms and the MCP, and the MCP
quantum eﬃciency, lead to the small overall detection eﬃciency.

Based on the detection eﬃciency, we can estimate N2S, the population of the metastable
cloud, and n2S, the peak metastable density in the trap. In a very cold sample (87 µK), as
many as 150 Lyman-α photons were observed on the MCP after a single laser shot, implying
N2S ≃ 8 × 107. The eﬀective volume, V2S = N2S/n2S, of the metastable clouds for these

3

samples is ∼ 1 × 10−3 cm3, which means that densities of ∼ 1011 cm−3 have been achieved.
Due to scatter from optics inside the trapping cell, each laser pulse induces some back-
ground ﬂuorescence which is detected with low eﬃciency at the MCP. The background,
which is typically small compared to the metastable signal, decays in a few milliseconds to a
negligible level. To establish a background correction for our decay data, the laser is tuned
far oﬀ resonance at the end of each trapping sequence. The background ﬂuorescence is then
recorded for the same cycle of wait times used when generating metastables.

In earlier experiments, performed in an entirely nonmetallic cell, we found that stray
electric ﬁelds limited metastable lifetimes to 1 ms or less.
In the current version of the
apparatus, a copper ﬁlm has been added to the inside surface of the trapping cell. The ﬁlm
is thin enough to allow rf to penetrate the trapping cell from outside coils, yet thick enough
to signiﬁcantly suppress stray dc ﬁelds. As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the copper ﬁlm has been
divided into several contiguous electrodes which are used to apply both the quench pulses
and a compensating dc ﬁeld. The dc voltage which best compensates for stray ﬁelds is found
by measuring the metastable decay rate in a low density sample for several applied voltages.
As shown in Fig. 2(b), we observe the expected quadratic dependence of the decay rate on
electric ﬁeld. With optimal stray ﬁeld compensation, metastable lifetimes as long as 100 ms
have been observed, approaching the natural lifetime of the 2S state.

Our decay measurements have focused on metastable clouds generated in four magnetic
trap conﬁgurations, spanning a range of temperatures and ground state densities. These
trap conﬁgurations are designated Traps W, X, Y, and Z, and each has its own standard
evaporation sequence for sample preparation. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, decay
measurements were repeated in each trap over several consecutive trap cycles.

Densities and temperatures of the standard samples and the approximate trajectories
by which they were created are depicted in Fig. 3 [21]. To ensure that the colder samples
(W, X, and Y) had reached thermal equilibrium, they were held undisturbed for 30 s after
the end of the forced evaporation. The sample densities were measured to 20% accuracy
by the bolometric method [13], and the temperatures were determined by a combination
of methods. For the coldest sample (W), the temperature was calibrated to within 5% by
measuring the width of the Doppler-sensitive 1S-2S line [16]. The temperature of Trap X
was determined by comparing the widths of the Doppler-free 1S-2S resonances of Traps W
and X in the low density limit [12]. For Traps Y and Z, the temperature was established
using results from a numerical simulation of evaporative cooling [22]. The temperature
uncertainty for Traps X, Y, and Z is estimated to be 10%.

III. EVIDENCE FOR 2S-2S TWO-BODY LOSS

Our investigation of inelastic 2S-2S collisions was initiated by observations of how the
In each of the standard traps the 2S
decay behavior depended on metastable density.
density was varied by generating metastables at diﬀerent laser detunings and also by exciting
diﬀerent 1S densities as the ground state sample decayed. The decay curves were binned
according to the total number of metastable signal counts in each decay curve. Since,
to a ﬁrst approximation, the signal is proportional to the metastable density, this means
that decay curves corresponding to approximately the same initial 2S density were averaged
together. For a preliminary analysis, the average decay curves were ﬁt to a simple exponential

4

function, with only the decay rate and initial amplitude as free parameters. Figure 4 shows
the results of this analysis. In the two coldest traps, W and X, the decay rate clearly increases
with increasing metastable density, consistent with the presence of two-body inelastic loss
processes. Furthermore, among the four traps, the decay rate is largest in Trap W, where
the highest metastable densities are achieved.

The peak 2S densities achieved in each trap can be estimated from the number of signal
counts observed, but the uncertainty is large, reﬂecting signiﬁcant uncertainties in both the
metastable cloud shape and the detection eﬃciency. The shape of the 2S cloud depends
sensitively on the location of the laser beam waists with respect to the magnetic trap. For
the density values listed in Fig. 4, a detection eﬃciency of 2 × 10−6 was assumed, and the
counterpropagating laser beams were assumed to be perfectly overlapped and well-aligned
with the atom cloud; with a plausible misalignment, the actual densities could be a factor
of 3 smaller.

As illustrated in Fig. 5, a comparison of the average decay curves at high and low
metastable signal provides further evidence for two-body loss at high densities. At low 2S
densities, the decay curves are well described by an exponential decay. By contrast, the
decay curves at high 2S densities deviate signiﬁcantly from a simple exponential. They are
better ﬁt by a “one-plus-two” model with a free two-body decay parameter and a one-body
decay rate ﬁxed at its low density value. The one-plus-two model is described further in
Sec. IV.

In principle, three-body inelastic collisions could also contribute to the observed density
dependence of the decay. However, the three-body loss rate constant for metastables would
have to be unexpectedly large to play a signiﬁcant role at our experimental densities (<
∼
1011 cm−3) [23]. In the following analysis, we assume that two-body eﬀects dominate.

IV. DETERMINATION OF THE TWO-BODY LOSS RATE CONSTANT

In this section, we derive the rate constant K2 for two-body loss of metastables based on
decay data of the form s(t), the number of signal counts observed when quenching at wait
time t. The constant is deﬁned as follows to give the rate of change of the local 2S density
n2S(r) due to two-body processes:

If the relative distribution of metastables in the trap is not changing in time (“static approx-
imation”), K2 is the product of the metastable detection eﬃciency, a factor describing the
cloud geometry, and a two-body decay parameter extracted from ﬁts to s(t). After analyzing
the decay process in the static approximation, we introduce dynamic corrections to obtain
ﬁnal results for K2.

Given the geometry of our apparatus and the ground state densities achieved, it is a
reasonable ﬁrst approximation to assume that the metastable cloud does not change shape
as it decays. The initial extent of the metastable cloud along the trap axis, about 2 cm
between the 1/e points, is deﬁned by the depth of focus of the laser. This is shorter than the
thermal length of the ground state cloud, which ranges from 4 cm in Trap W to 23 cm in
Trap Z. On the time scale of the decay, the 2S atoms collide frequently with 1S atoms. At

5

the peak ground state density in Trap W, for example, the 2S mean free path is 100 µm, and
the mean time between collisions is 70 µs. (To calculate these values, we use the theoretical
value for a1S−2S, the elastic 1S-2S scattering length [24].) Thus, the metastables diﬀuse
slowly along the trap axis. Numerical simulations of the time evolution of the 2S cloud have
shown that over a cloud lifetime of 100 ms, the shape of the initial axial distribution does not
change dramatically [21]. In the radial direction, the cloud shape evolves even less, although
for a diﬀerent reason. Due to the geometry of the magnetic trap, the metastable cloud is
cylindrically symmetric and conﬁned to the same thermal radius as the ground state cloud.
This thermal radius, about 110 µm for Trap W, is comparable to the 2S mean free path.
In a time shorter than the 2 ms excitation pulse, the metastables establish an equilibrium
spatial distribution across the short radial dimension. The relative spatial distribution of
metastables is quasi-static, then, because (1) axial diﬀusion through the 1S gas is slow and
(2) radial equilibrium exists over the lifetime of the 2S cloud.

In the static approximation, the rate of signal decay can be described by the diﬀerential

equation

where α1 and α2 are, respectively, parameters corresponding to one- and two-body decay.
The solution to Eq. 2 is

˙s = −α1s − α2s2,

s(t) =

α1Aoe−α1t
α1 + α2Ao(1 − e−α1t)

,

which we have named the “one-plus-two” model. The parameter α1 is the one-body decay
rate, the total rate of decay due to processes which are independent of 2S density. Contri-
butions to the one-body rate include the natural decay of the 2S state, quenching due to
stray electric ﬁelds, and inelastic collisions with the background 1S gas.

For a decay measurement with a very high signal-to-noise ratio, one could extract α1, α2,
and Ao simultaneously by a ﬁt to the “one-plus-two” model. The parameters α1 and α2 are
highly correlated, however. With the modest signal-to-noise ratio in our data, a consistent
convergence of the ﬁt is not assured. Thus, we employ an alternate method of analysis. For
a given trap and 1S density, the value for α1 is determined by extrapolating the best-ﬁtting
exponential decay rates to zero metastable density (Fig. 6). This leaves two free parameters
in the one-plus-two model: Ao, the signal which would be observed at t = 0, and α2, from
which K2 can be calculated.

By integrating Eq. 1 over the entire trap, we obtain an expression for the total number

of metastables lost per unit time due to two-body processes:

R

Thus to determine K2 from our decay data it is necessary to know ǫ and the shape of the
metastable cloud. Our method for determining ǫ was described in Sec. II. To calculate ζ for
various trap conﬁgurations and temperatures, we employed a Monte Carlo simulation of 1S-
2S excitation in our trap [25]. The simulation calculates the excitation lineshape associated
with atoms in a volume slice perpendicular to the trap axis. In addition to the position of the
volume slice along the axis, the inputs to the simulation include the laser ﬁeld geometry, the
laser pulse length, the trap shape, the sample temperature, and the peak 1S density. The
lineshape is calculated by choosing atoms randomly from a thermal distribution, computing
their trajectories during the laser pulse, and then ﬁnding the contribution of each atom to
the spectrum by Fourier-transforming the time-varying laser ﬁeld amplitude seen by the
atom. The eﬀects of the 1S-2S cold collision shift [13] are incorporated by allowing the
resonance frequency to vary over the trajectory in accordance with the local 1S density.
After repeating the lineshape calculation for many slices covering the length of the 2S cloud
along the trap axis, the axial distribution of metastables at t = 0 can be extracted for any
given laser detuning. Under the assumption that the metastables establish an equilibrium
radial distribution during the pulse, f2S(r) for the entire trap is easily calculated from the
axial distribution.

An additional numerical calculation corrects the lineshape simulation results to account
for photoionization, the promotion of 2S electrons to the continuum by the excitation laser.
In a cold, dense sample, such as those prepared in Trap W, the metastables spend a rela-
tively long time in the high-intensity UV laser ﬁeld, and the fraction of metastables lost to
photoionization can exceed 30% [21].

Because the lineshape simulation has given results in good agreement with experimental
1S-2S spectra for a wide range of trap shapes, densities, and temperatures, this method of
calculating f2S(r) is believed reliable. For each spatial distribution function, ζ is computed
by numerical evaluation of Eq. 7. Values for ζ range from approximately 2 × 10−3 cm3 in
Trap W to 0.2 cm3 in Trap Z. Depending on the laser detuning, an imperfect overlap of
the counterpropagating laser beam focuses along the trap axis may cause ζ to be 50-100%
larger. Uncertainty in the knowledge of the laser ﬁeld geometry is the principal source of
uncertainty in ζ.

The experimental results for K2, calculated on the basis of Eq. 6, are listed in the “static
approximation” column of Table I. For each standard trap, the accumulated decay curves
were binned together according to laser detuning, and the resulting average curves were ﬁt
with the one-plus-two model to obtain α2 as a function of detuning. Next, the values for α2

7

were multiplied by the detection eﬃciency and the value of ζ appropriate for the detuning.
The resulting values for K2 were found to be largely independent of laser detuning, indicating
that variations in metastable cloud shape with detuning are reasonably accounted for by
our lineshape simulation. For Traps W and X, the weighted averages across all detunings
are reported in Table I. In the warmer samples, where the 2S density is too low to observe
two-body collisions, the weighted average for K2 is consistent with zero. For these, Table I
reports upper limits for K2 based on linear addition of the uncertainties in α2, ǫ, and ζ.

The error bars for Traps W and X are primarily due to systematic uncertainties. These
errors are asymmetric due to asymmetric uncertainty in the detection eﬃciency and the
fact that laser misalignments generally increase ζ. The most important contributions to
the overall error in K2 come from the detection eﬃciency and uncertainty in the axial

overlap of the laser focuses.
relative uncertainties of 30% on the lower side and 60% on the upper side. The focus
overlap uncertainty contributes 75% to the upper relative error. Other sources of uncertainty
include the error in the determination of α2 (±12%) and contributions of a few percent each
due to uncertainties in the beam radius, cold collision shift parameter, oﬀset of the trap
minimum and laser focuses, ground state density, and sample temperature. With some
minor exceptions, the various uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated, and the relative
errors we report for K2 are essentially quadrature sums of the contributing errors.

The static approximation results need to be reﬁned to account for change in the
metastable spatial distribution while the cloud decays. There is a ﬂattening of the ini-
tial axial distribution due to diﬀusion and to two-body loss, which occurs preferentially
where the 2S density is highest. This ﬂattening of the distribution in time causes the initial
decay of the metastable population to be somewhat less steep than it would be if the cloud
shape were completely static. Thus, the value of α2 determined by ﬁtting a decay curve to
the one-plus-two model is smaller than the eﬀective value of α2 which accounts for dynamics
when substituted into Eq. 6.

To calculate corrections to the static approximation analysis, a numerical simulation of
the decaying metastable cloud was developed. For each standard sample, the simulation was
repeated many times assuming diﬀerent laser detunings. The starting point for each simu-
lation run was a cloud with distribution f2S(r), calculated by the method described above,
and an initial total number of metastables N2S(0) = Ao/ǫ, where Ao = s(0) was determined
from experimental data. The simulation then evolved both dynamic and static clouds for-
ward in time from the initial condition. For the dynamic cloud, the axial distribution was
adjusted locally at each time step for losses due to one-body processes (parametrized by α1),
two-body processes (parametrized by a putative value for K2), and for diﬀusion of 2S atoms
in the 1S background. For the static cloud, N2S was adjusted at each time step for one- and
two-body losses integrated over the whole cloud, but the spatial distribution remained ﬁxed.
After evolving the clouds over 100 ms, the simulated static and dynamic metastable decay
curves were ﬁt by the one-plus-two model. The ratio α2,static/α2,dynamic from the simulation
was used as a correction factor for the experimentally determined α2 values. New average
values for K2 were then calculated for each trap. It was found that the static approximation
values of K2 must be multiplied by 1.35 and 1.30, respectively, to correct for dynamics in
Traps W and X. By varying the inputs to the decay simulation, the uncertainty in the overall
correction factors was estimated to be 10%. For Traps Y and Z, a conservative upper limit

8

for the correction factor is 2. The ﬁnal results for K2 are summarized in the last column of
Table I.

Theoretical 2S-2S collision rates at low temperatures were calculated recently by For-
rey and collaborators [14], extending their previous work for high temperatures [1]. The
calculations indicate that the most prevalent inelastic process in a cold metastable cloud is
double excitation transfer, H(2S) + H(2S) −→ H(2P ) + H(2P ). Next in importance are the
two possible ionization processes: associative ionization, in which the molecular ion H+
2 is
formed, and Penning ionization, where the internal energy of one metastable atom causes
the ionization of a second metastable. Since processes involving 2S hyperﬁne state changes
are mediated by comparatively weak magnetic dipole interactions, they are expected to be
negligible in relation to excitation transfer and ionization. Thus, a theoretical estimate for
K2 is obtained by summing the loss rate constants for double excitation transfer and ion-
ization. For each process, the loss rate constant equals 2hσvi, where σ is the cross section
for the process, v is the relative velocity of two atoms, the angle brackets indicate a thermal
average, and the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that two metastables are lost in each
collision. The theoretical curve for K2 as a function of temperature is shown alongside the
experimental values in Fig. 7.

The uncertainty in the theoretical results is diﬃcult to estimate.

In its current state
of development, the theory for 2S-2S collisions neglects hyperﬁne structure and assumes
zero coupling between the relative orbital angular momentum of the nuclei and the angular
momentum of the electrons. It is not yet certain whether this assumption is justiﬁed for
spin-polarized metastables at low temperatures [23]. Furthermore, the theory calculations
assume zero magnetic ﬁeld, while in the experiment the trapped metastables experience a
ﬁeld of a few gauss. Nevertheless, from Fig. 7 we can conclude that the present theory
correctly predicts K2 at low temperatures to within an order of magnitude.

An intriguing aspect of the experimental results for K2 is the apparent temperature
dependence between 87 µK and 230 µK. Although the absolute uncertainty is large for each
temperature point, we believe that the temperature dependence is real. The error bars
are primarily due to systematic uncertainties which aﬀect both points in approximately the
same way. When the correlated errors are removed, the ratio of K2 at 87 µK to K2 at
230 µK is found to be 1.9 ± 0.4. This result contrasts with the theoretical prediction that
K2 is virtually independent of temperature in this regime, consistent with Wigner threshold
behavior. Further theoretical and experimental work will be necessary to understand the
temperature dependence of inelastic 2S-2S collisions near T = 0.

V. UPPER LIMIT FOR THE 1S-2S LOSS RATE CONSTANT

In addition to the two-body loss channels discussed above, metastables are lost from the
trap by several one-body mechanisms. These include the natural decay of the 2S state by
spontaneous emission of two photons, quenching due to stray electric ﬁelds, and loss due to
inelastic 1S-2S collisions. In a collision with a ground state atom, a metastable may be lost
by a transition to either an untrapped 2S state (hyperﬁne-changing collision) or to a 2P
state (excitation transfer). If inelastic 1S-2S collisions are suﬃciently probable, they should
result in a dependence of the observed one-body decay parameter α1 on the peak ground
state density n1S,o.

9

To search for evidence of inelastic 1S-2S collisions, the decay curves taken in the standard
trap conﬁgurations were organized into consecutive time bins of 9.6 s duration. Next, a value
for α1 was determined for each bin by extrapolating the decay rate to zero metastable signal,
as in Fig. 6. Then, for each trap, α1 was plotted as a function of time over the 120 s period
following initial preparation of the sample (see Fig. 8(a), for example). During this time,
the ground state density decays signiﬁcantly due to 1S-1S dipolar decay (Fig. 8(b)).

As shown in Fig. 8, the data suggests that some component of one-body loss decreases
as the ground state density decreases. However, since the trend is not large relative to
uncertainties, it is inconclusive whether signiﬁcant loss due to 1S-2S collisions exists in our
metastable clouds. We have not attempted to ﬁt the time (or density) dependence of α1 to
a model but instead have determined conservative upper limits for the metastable loss rate
due to collisions with the ground state background.

An upper limit on the total inelastic contribution α1,inel to the one-body decay rate is
found by subtracting the natural decay rate (γnat = 8.2 s−1) from the total one-body decay
rate:

α1,inel < α1 − γnat.

Analogous to Eq. 1, we deﬁne a rate constant K12 for the metastable loss rate due to inelastic
1S-2S collisions, such that

˙n2S(r)

= −K12 n1S(r)n2S(r).

Using a static approximation for the metastable cloud, Eq. 9 can be integrated over the
entire trap to ﬁnd the relation between K12 and α1,inel:

where V2S =
upper limit for the initial value of α1,inel in each trap, a numerically computed upper limit
for the ratio V2S/Q12, and the measured peak density, we have obtained the upper limits on
K12 listed in Table II.

These upper limits are much larger than the theoretical rate constant for 1S-1S dipolar
decay, g = 1.2 × 10−15 cm3/s [2]. Since the total rate constant for 1S-2S hyperﬁne-changing
collisions is expected to be comparable to g, our results admit the possibility that 1S-2S
excitation transfer collisions are much more probable than hyperﬁne-changing collisions.
A ﬁrst theoretical calculation of the relevant cross sections in this temperature regime is
currently in progress [26].

In summary, we have completed the ﬁrst determinations of loss rates due to inelastic
collisions in a cold, trapped metastable H gas coexisting with a ground state background.
The experimental values for the two-body loss rate K2 agree to order of magnitude (∼
10−9 cm3/s) with the present theory for 2S-2S collisions. Further reﬁnements to the theory

will be necessary to explain an apparent increase in K2 with decreasing temperature below
230 µK. Our metastable decay measurements also show that the total rate constant for
inelastic 1S-2S collisions is not larger than ∼ 10−13 cm3/s at the temperatures probed
below 1 mK.

The present results pertain to total 2S-2S and 1S-2S inelastic collision rates. In future
experiments with an enhanced Lyman-α detection eﬃciency and more complete suppression
of stray electric ﬁelds, it may be possible to measure the rates due to excitation transfer
processes alone by directly observing the ﬂuorescence of 2P states generated in collisions.

With the ability to create clouds of 107-108 trapped metastables and a preliminary under-
standing of their inelastic collisions, the prospects are bright for fruitful new spectroscopic
experiments involving the 2S state. Recently, our group has performed spectroscopy of the
H 2S-4P transition in a magnetic trap for the ﬁrst time. Absorption spectroscopy on this
and other single-photon transitions provide new tools for studying interactions of hydrogen
states at low temperatures. It will also soon be possible to excite narrow two-photon transi-
tions from the 2S state, setting the stage for precision frequency measurements which probe
fundamental physics.

FIG. 1. (a) A schematic of the cryogenic trapping apparatus. Superconducting magnets pro-
duce the Ioﬀe-Pritchard trapping ﬁeld. The UV excitation laser is reﬂected back on itself to permit
Doppler-free two-photon excitation. The apparatus is roughly cylindrically symmetric about the
trap axis, to which the laser is aligned. (b) Timing diagram for 1S-2S excitation spectroscopy.
After a ∼ 2 ms excitation pulse and an additional time twait, the metastables are Stark-quenched
by an electric ﬁeld pulse, resulting in a burst of Lyman-α photons. In a typical decay measurement,
twait is cycled through values between 1 and 92 ms.

FIG. 4. Decay rates determined by exponential ﬁts to decay curves recorded at diﬀerent
metastable signal levels in Traps W, X, Y, and Z. The bottom edge of the plot corresponds to
the natural 2S decay rate of 8.2 s−1, and the error bars are derived assuming only statistical un-
certainty in the decay data. Diﬀerent signal levels were achieved by varying the laser detuning
and allowing the ground state sample to decay. The metastable signal, which is approximately
proportional to the metastable density, has been normalized to the peak signal observed in each
trap; estimates of the peak 2S density corresponding to the peak signal are given in the legend.
The metastable clouds produced in Traps W and X show a clear density dependence of the decay
rate.

FIG. 5. Average decay curves for an initial 2S density near the maximum achieved in Trap
W (circles) and for an initial density in Trap W more than six times smaller (triangles). An
exponential decay describes the low density data well, but the the high density data deviates
signiﬁcantly from the best ﬁtting exponential decay. A simple “one-plus-two” model which has a
ﬁxed one-body decay parameter and a free two-body decay parameter ﬁts the ﬁrst ∼ 50 ms of the
decay curve well. The model assumes a static cloud shape; in reality, the 2S cloud changes shape
as it decays, leading to deviation from the model at long wait times.

FIG. 6. Determination of α1 by linear extrapolation of exponential decay rates to zero
metastable signal. The decay data in this example was recorded in Trap W, and the bottom
edge of the plot represents the natural decay rate. To avoid possible systematic errors due to a
changing ground state density, the data set includes only those decay curves recorded in the ﬁrst
9.6 s following excitation. The error bars on the decay rates assume only statistical errors in the
decay curves; the uncertainty in α1 is based on the scatter of decay rate values with respect to the
linear ﬁt.
